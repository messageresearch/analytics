[24:17] foreign
[24:28] and now I'm free
[24:36] of myself
[24:39] [Music]
[24:51] praise His Wonderful Name Hallelujah
[24:55] well we just want to use this
[24:57] opportunity to take up the tithes and
[24:58] offerings
[25:01] open our
[25:03] service and prayer
[25:07] it's good to be in the house of God Amen
[25:10] amen we just wanna
[25:12] also bring some prayer requests for our
[25:14] brother Tommy's asking prayer for Trent
[25:16] he's
[25:18] needs to make some decisions in life and
[25:22] you know the
[25:24] the older your children grow and
[25:27] the more serious the decisions get and
[25:30] the greater the consequences
[25:33] and so we we know that
[25:38] God has it all in control
[25:41] we know that God has his hand over his
[25:44] elected and
[25:45] God's given us a promise for our
[25:47] children
[25:49] so let's just bind together with brother
[25:51] Tommy and
[25:52] just ask God to move on the scene and to
[25:54] change hearts
[25:57] change Minds change lives that his will
[26:01] would be done
[26:02] would you do that
[26:04] would you join together with brother
[26:05] Tommy
[26:07] and I'm sure we'll see the fruits of it
[26:09] very soon that's my heart's desire amen
[26:15] we also
[26:16] I just want to remember
[26:21] brother Enos he's in search of a job
[26:23] he's been looking for about seven months
[26:26] he's in the I.T field and
[26:30] he's
[26:32] he wants God to move on the scene and to
[26:34] open a door for him
[26:36] so thankful he's he's not a God who only
[26:39] opens doors
[26:41] he's a God who closes doors
[26:44] because I've needed doors closed before
[26:45] because
[26:47] I would have walked through it
[26:50] but God being a the great Shepherd
[26:53] the Great Captain knows how to open and
[26:55] he knows how to close
[26:57] so I just pray that God would give him
[26:59] peace
[27:00] and then this time may he find the mind
[27:02] of God for his life and just lead him to
[27:04] that right job amen
[27:06] God knows how to do things
[27:09] we just also want to make mention that
[27:13] the Sunday school for ages four to six
[27:15] and also seven through nine will be
[27:17] going to the back
[27:19] for Sunday School
[27:21] at this time so you can be dismissed
[27:24] [Music]

[27:29] wasn't that wonderful
[27:32] I tell you I really enjoyed uh the word
[27:35] of God just being
[27:37] laid out straight that's what I want
[27:40] tell me where I'm wrong
[27:42] tell me where I need to get right give
[27:45] it to me straight that's what the bride
[27:46] wants we don't we don't want it watered
[27:49] down or sugar coated just give it to me
[27:51] straight because there's something
[27:53] inside the Bride of Jesus Christ we just
[27:55] want to be right
[27:56] if I'm wrong Lord correct me

[28:12] from Spain from what I understand he he
[28:15] does work in um
[28:17] in South America and all over and he
[28:20] speaks multiple languages so it's just
[28:22] always
[28:23] encouraging when you
[28:26] um have brothers that you meet that are
[28:28] just wanting to carry the work of God
[28:31] no he doesn't God understands
[28:36] Our God understands all languages matter
[28:39] of fact on the day of Pentecost my
[28:41] brother everybody understood in their
[28:43] own language maybe this will maybe this
[28:45] will be the evening
[28:47] but we one thing I can tell you about
[28:49] this church brother
[28:50] is we can feel the spirit
[28:53] and so you can pray in a language and we
[28:54] might not able to understand one word

[44:22] father what a blessing to
[44:25] come to the pulpit with my granddaughter
[44:28] singing Lord that's a blessing
[44:31] I thank you for it father I thank you
[44:34] for those that have come out tonight to
[44:38] hear your word father may they be
[44:41] strengthened
[44:43] may they be encouraged May our
[44:46] understanding be enlightened
[44:49] May our purpose be clear in God's word
[44:52] and
[44:54] Lord lead us
[44:57] we really want to work on your behalf
[45:00] father is reading and
[45:04] looking at some of the things in
[45:07] Nehemiah
[45:08] father they were a people that had a
[45:11] mind to work
[45:13] father and we want to have a mind to
[45:15] work for your kingdom
[45:16] father we're building up a spiritual man
[45:20] Lord strengthened on the inner man
[45:23] Lord we're just
[45:26] wanting so much more of you
[45:28] we ask you to bless us tonight and
[45:31] just be a wonderful
[45:34] Enlightenment to us in strength we ask
[45:38] these things in Jesus name we pray amen
[45:42] amen amen let's just uh turn back to
[45:46] Nehemiah just for a moment and uh
[45:50] we'll read the the scriptures and uh
[45:54] we're going to kind of uh backtrack a
[45:57] little bit but I just trust it'll be a
[45:59] blessing to you and and just a
[46:02] fortification
[46:04] and so we're going to go back to um
[46:09] uh the 17th and 18th verse
[46:13] of the second chapter of Nehemiah
[46:20] and he said here he said then I said
[46:23] unto them
[46:25] ye see the distress
[46:28] that we are in
[46:30] and I think that's a wonderful scripture
[46:33] for us recognizing our condition
[46:37] that was a great Enlightenment the
[46:39] prophet said that we had to recognize
[46:41] our day in this message
[46:44] and you know you'll never seek help
[46:47] unless you can recognize your condition
[46:50] if you don't think you're sick you're
[46:52] not going to go to the doctor if you
[46:54] think that you're you're good you're not
[46:57] going to ask for any change if you think
[47:00] you're right you're not going to seek
[47:02] after any knowledge or truth but if you
[47:06] could realize and and see the condition
[47:10] that we're in the distress that we're in
[47:13] then we can go forward he said you see
[47:18] the distress that we're in how Jerusalem
[47:21] life waste and the gates thereof are
[47:25] burned with fire
[47:27] come let us build up the wall of
[47:31] Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach
[47:36] then I told them of the hand of my God
[47:39] which was good unto me as also the
[47:43] king's words that he had spoke unto me
[47:46] and they said let us rise up and build
[47:50] so they strengthen their hands for the
[47:54] good work God bless you may be seated
[48:02] to
[48:04] kind of go back over
[48:07] not everything we said this morning but
[48:10] the things that we talked about the
[48:13] necessity of building a wall
[48:16] so I want to play this evening for you
[48:20] 18 minutes out of the message
[48:23] the God's power to transform how many
[48:27] believes that God's got power to change
[48:29] things amen that that that's that's what
[48:34] we count on and that's what that was
[48:37] their testimony when everybody said oh
[48:40] we want to jump in and help they said no
[48:42] God will provide for us he says this is
[48:46] our inheritance and we're not going to
[48:49] share the glory of God's word with
[48:52] anybody you know this is for God's
[48:54] people
[48:55] and and we know that this word is for an
[49:00] elected people we're going to start and
[49:03] of course you have the ability to go
[49:05] back and listen to the whole message it
[49:08] is a a great message it's very uh strong
[49:13] and very uh
[49:16] uh
[49:17] you know very powerful
[49:19] but we're going to start in paragraph
[49:22] 58
[49:24] and I as we're listening to this
[49:27] the reason I want to play this portion
[49:30] of tape
[49:31] so that we can really understand
[49:35] what it is that we're building our wall
[49:38] against
[49:40] and that's what walls are for right
[49:43] they're to keep out the enemy they're to
[49:46] give distinction
[49:48] they're given to give Clarity uh I think
[49:54] most of us probably have fence around
[49:57] our property and the reason we do that
[49:59] is it's the it's the line that says this
[50:03] is this is what I'm going to take care
[50:05] of this is what I'm going to mow I I
[50:09] love it when I go down the street and
[50:11] two properties will come together
[50:12] there's only this much space
[50:15] between their driveways but one guy will
[50:18] mow half of it
[50:20] you know what I mean because that's his
[50:23] line you know what I mean now you know
[50:26] he may have mowed it one day for the
[50:28] other guy and the other guy might have
[50:30] come out hey
[50:32] don't mow my lawn
[50:34] you know what I mean I'll mow my lawn
[50:36] when I feel like it
[50:38] you know and uh
[50:41] so we don't know all the reasons but I
[50:45] think what we've got to really
[50:47] understand is that there's lines of
[50:50] Distinction
[50:51] there's clear cut lines of Distinction
[50:54] so we we want to see what it is what is
[51:00] what are we keeping out why are we
[51:04] building the line what's trying to come
[51:07] in and I thought there's really no
[51:09] better way for me to express it than
[51:12] just it just takes 18 minutes for us to
[51:15] listen as the prophet describes
[51:19] what
[51:20] is is happening in our generation and
[51:24] and why the walls are being built and I
[51:28] think you'll enjoy it uh
[51:31] you know brother REM says it says many
[51:33] many things in just a straight forward
[51:36] teaching voice just says it out there
[51:39] it's it's just matter of fact
[51:43] and I just think the bride lights up at
[51:46] it so if you have a device uh
[51:50] uh I I don't like that word device it
[51:52] just got a bad feeling to it but if you
[51:55] have something that you want to read
[51:57] along with or look or Mark uh your pad
[52:00] of some sort uh feel free if not I'm
[52:03] sure they'll play it up on the board but
[52:06] just this is preached in uh
[52:10] in
[52:11] let me give you the date for sure it's
[52:15] uh
[52:16] 1965 911 1965.
[52:22] it has significant and isn't it okay
[52:25] tell me that 911 didn't transform our
[52:28] whole country
[52:30] I started having to take off my shoes
[52:32] when I got in an airplane I couldn't
[52:34] drink water no more
[52:36] you know I had to go through a metal
[52:38] detector all kinds of things change and
[52:42] and in the direction but I want to just
[52:45] talk uh uh there there's just a a few
[52:50] great things that took place in this
[52:52] time uh this is right around the time
[52:55] that uh
[52:59] sister Florence
[53:02] I'm trying to think of oh
[53:06] no
[53:07] the Full Gospel businessman's
[53:11] shakarian
[53:12] she had passed away and and brother
[53:16] Branham had prophesied that she would
[53:20] in fact I believe he even spoke the hour
[53:23] in which that she would go away and
[53:26] everybody in the church around and
[53:28] everybody they stood up and prophesied
[53:31] that she would live and they called the
[53:34] blessings of God down and and they
[53:37] prophesied and and with tongues and
[53:40] interpretations of tongues and and
[53:43] everything just
[53:45] and I I remember
[53:47] you know Billy Paul asking his father I
[53:51] heard this story myself from them and
[53:53] and he said that I asked daddy about it
[53:57] you know how brother Billy would talk
[53:58] and he said she's it's going to happen
[54:01] just the way God showed me and it did
[54:04] just the way of God children that's how
[54:07] sure this Prophet was of what he was
[54:10] teaching and I appreciate that he wasn't
[54:13] ashamed to preach what he said so he'll
[54:16] mention that in this or I'll read a
[54:19] quote containing about but just sit back
[54:22] and just think as we listen to this what
[54:26] am I building my walls against
[54:29] how treacherous is the enemy that's
[54:33] trying to get into my life and what is
[54:37] he trying to do to me and I believe I
[54:42] hope it'll bless you so let's just
[54:43] listen together to these next 18 minutes
[54:46] it won't be long God bless you
[54:54] Jesus Was His only begotten son
[54:58] he was begotten by a woman but Adam was
[55:03] right straight from the hand of God in
[55:06] the creation Now the headquarters with
[55:09] his his son and his son's bride overall
[55:13] it looked so perfect there was a a man
[55:18] the head of all of it his own son and
[55:21] his bride and every seed was perfect The
[55:25] Palms and the Oaks and the grass and the
[55:28] birds and the animals and everything was
[55:31] in perfect order with the Commandment of
[55:34] God don't change your nature
[55:40] bring forth of its kind
[55:43] every seed oh don't you never be
[55:46] perverted into a pawpaw tree see Palm
[55:50] don't you be perverted into something
[55:53] else but every seed after his time
[55:58] and he he watched it through the times
[56:01] that it spoke the word and his great
[56:04] creating power had formed these things
[56:06] that come up and even the man and the
[56:08] woman and they were their head because
[56:10] they were the they were super to all the
[56:13] other races and he put them
[56:16] also under a care of the same thing that
[56:20] he put trees animals and so forth his
[56:23] word
[56:25] they must not never by no means break
[56:29] that word
[56:31] they must stay there don't never take
[56:34] anything from it or add anything to it
[56:36] you must live by this word and as long
[56:39] as that creation would have existed like
[56:42] that sister sha Karen wouldn't have had
[56:44] to have went this morning
[56:46] as long as it would have stayed like
[56:48] that God's Great economy
[56:52] it's what we believe that we're headed
[56:55] back to
[56:57] we're going back to that spot that place
[57:00] or that seventh morning God looked upon
[57:04] it all and he said it's good
[57:06] I'm pleased with it I'm glad I did it
[57:11] and it's all now under control
[57:15] and I put trust in my son that in his
[57:19] wife that if they'll make them ahead of
[57:23] all of us that they'll watch over it all
[57:24] and see that it's all right that
[57:27] everything will bring forth of its kind
[57:30] now he has the power to do that
[57:32] God then said well if it's all so good
[57:35] and it can't be anything else because
[57:37] it's my own desire
[57:40] it's the way I want it
[57:42] and I spoke it that way and my words has
[57:45] brought it just exactly the way I wanted
[57:48] it and there it is it's all good so the
[57:51] Bible said God rested the seventh day
[57:54] from all his works and
[57:58] everything under control to bring forth
[58:01] of its time now remember to bring when
[58:04] he put the seed in the Earth the seed
[58:07] can only come forth with the power of
[58:11] life within it to transform it from a
[58:14] seed to a plant or whatever it was
[58:17] he is transforming power
[58:20] now God put the seed in there
[58:24] with potentials that it would be what he
[58:28] said it would be and as long as it
[58:30] stayed in its right category it would be
[58:33] just exactly what God said it would be
[58:35] it had to be that way because he had
[58:38] made it that way and made a channel
[58:41] that anything that stays in his channel
[58:44] in his line of word it will have to
[58:48] bring forth exactly like his word said
[58:51] it would be
[58:52] it cannot move from there
[58:55] it's Channel just exactly right so with
[58:58] everything and the trust in his own son
[59:00] that it would be that way then God said
[59:03] it's all good so uh just rest
[59:08] and each one of those seeds has power in
[59:10] itself to transform itself into the
[59:13] species
[59:15] that our desire to be that's what it
[59:18] must be because I have given every seed
[59:21] transforming power
[59:24] the make out of itself
[59:26] in its potentials now to make out of
[59:28] itself exactly what I wanted to be
[59:32] God has never changed
[59:35] just the same today as he was then
[59:39] God's determined to do something
[59:41] do it nothing's going to stop him he'll
[59:44] do it
[59:46] now after it's all so well and set in
[59:48] order God felt assured now that this
[59:52] would all be all right and then when he
[59:54] did then came in the enemy
[59:58] I'm go to God Gave power to transform
[1:00:03] and I'm going to call this fella with
[1:00:06] power not to to create again but um he
[1:00:11] had power to deform
[1:00:14] not transform but to deform not anything
[1:00:18] deformed is taken from its original
[1:00:22] state
[1:00:24] there's something that's gone wrong with
[1:00:27] it
[1:00:28] some years ago on patrol going up
[1:00:30] through the corn fields uh I would think
[1:00:33] of a there was a land brought off of a
[1:00:37] tree
[1:00:38] and it fell over on a stalk of corn and
[1:00:41] the stock was tying its best to get up
[1:00:44] straight like it was supposed to be
[1:00:47] but it was deformed because that
[1:00:51] something had happened
[1:00:54] and uh
[1:00:55] stick was laying over then we'd find a
[1:00:59] wild creeper
[1:01:00] in the field which many of you man here
[1:01:04] maybe some of you women
[1:01:06] could come from Kentucky the women uses
[1:01:09] the whole there his thing as a man a get
[1:01:11] out in the field with the with the hole
[1:01:14] we call the old gooseneck hole and chop
[1:01:16] the The Creepers out
[1:01:19] or if you didn't get those Creepers out
[1:01:22] where the corn was in the roll like this
[1:01:25] then that creeper would reach over grab
[1:01:30] a hold of that car and wrap itself
[1:01:32] around gradually so easy so slowly that
[1:01:36] you hardly tell it was rapping and
[1:01:38] finally gets stronger and stronger and
[1:01:41] it pulls that corn to its deformed
[1:01:45] pulls it against itself
[1:01:48] wraps it around its own Vine deforming
[1:01:52] it from what it was to something else
[1:01:54] yet it's corn
[1:01:56] but it's deformed corn
[1:02:00] and we are all still in the image of God
[1:02:05] but but are so deformed
[1:02:10] as sons of God
[1:02:13] of God that walked contrary to his word
[1:02:15] and to you the way that that he had us
[1:02:18] and provided for us to walk
[1:02:21] setting something the world twists this
[1:02:23] out of the way pull us close to it and
[1:02:27] away from that straight narrow
[1:02:29] strip that he planted Us in to be Sons
[1:02:32] and Daughters of God sin has done this
[1:02:36] evil thing to the Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:40] God
[1:02:41] the Deep farmer I know this seems to be
[1:02:44] rather strange to speak of it in this
[1:02:47] way the the D form but that's what he
[1:02:51] was he deformed our perverted
[1:02:55] pervert needs to be changed over made
[1:02:57] something different and uh deform is the
[1:03:00] same thing that it's been brought over
[1:03:02] deep armed and made in a another way yet
[1:03:05] is still the same seed but it's deformed
[1:03:09] now
[1:03:11] we find that this deep farmer
[1:03:14] has also had
[1:03:17] same amount of time to defarm
[1:03:21] as God had
[1:03:24] to transform
[1:03:26] he planted his seat or never planted his
[1:03:29] seed
[1:03:30] he in the Garden of Eden since that time
[1:03:34] he's had 6 000 years of deforming
[1:03:39] the seed of God the word of God the
[1:03:42] deform it make it something different
[1:03:45] when he the first time that Eve listened
[1:03:48] to him and got herself just one little
[1:03:52] phrase remember first Satan quoted that
[1:03:54] scripture just as clear as they could be
[1:03:56] God has said that ye shall not eat of
[1:04:00] every tree in the Garden of Eden see you
[1:04:04] shall not eat of every treat
[1:04:06] and uh remember now
[1:04:09] he said yes we may eat of every tree but
[1:04:12] the tree that's in the midst of the
[1:04:14] garden we mustn't even touch it
[1:04:18] I'll watch him in his message twist that
[1:04:21] word just a little bit
[1:04:23] and saying
[1:04:25] he said for God said that if we do this
[1:04:29] that day we die he said oh surely
[1:04:32] you'll not die
[1:04:34] see he was a a man he said you you do
[1:04:40] this now and you're you're kind of an
[1:04:42] ignorant people
[1:04:44] you really you don't know all things but
[1:04:48] if you would only partake of this then
[1:04:51] you would have wisdom
[1:04:54] you'd have knowledge you know right from
[1:04:57] wrong and be like gods
[1:04:59] you if you'd only partake of this wisdom
[1:05:03] that I have I know but you don't but
[1:05:07] it's all right to have wisdom but if the
[1:05:09] wisdom is contrary
[1:05:12] if the wisdom isn't
[1:05:15] correct wisdom from God
[1:05:17] Divine wisdom and becomes natural wisdom
[1:05:20] I don't care how much science we have
[1:05:23] and what more education it's of the
[1:05:25] devil
[1:05:27] I'll prove it to you Lord willing in a
[1:05:29] few minutes
[1:05:30] it's of the devil civilization is of the
[1:05:34] devil
[1:05:35] just got through preaching on that
[1:05:37] all culture in the Earth all the powers
[1:05:41] of Science and everything is of the
[1:05:45] devil it's his gospel he preached of
[1:05:48] knowledge in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:50] and he's took that knowledge
[1:05:53] perverted knowledge contrary to the word
[1:05:56] and will and plan of God
[1:05:58] and now
[1:06:00] he's had 6 000 years to do just exactly
[1:06:06] what God did only in a perverted way it
[1:06:09] took the same amount of time to bring
[1:06:12] his own Eden in
[1:06:15] now he's got to eat in here on Earth
[1:06:18] and it's filled with wisdom knowledge
[1:06:22] that was his gospel at the beginning
[1:06:24] knowledge
[1:06:27] wisdom
[1:06:28] science never did God ever cater to such
[1:06:32] and I I want you to watch him in he did
[1:06:36] this
[1:06:37] and because it
[1:06:39] he was a man of worldly wisdom
[1:06:45] now it's hard to say this
[1:06:48] it's it's very hard because speaking to
[1:06:51] people who feel the same way I do
[1:06:54] and the way I have been for many years
[1:06:57] but since the opening of those Seven
[1:06:59] Seals of the Angels just behind the
[1:07:02] mountain the other this has become a new
[1:07:04] book
[1:07:07] it's the things that's been hid it's
[1:07:10] being revealed as God promised the
[1:07:13] Revelation 10 he would do it
[1:07:15] and we are the privileged people that
[1:07:18] God has chosen of the earth that we
[1:07:22] might see and understand these things
[1:07:24] which is not some mythical
[1:07:27] fleshly Mind of a person trying to make
[1:07:30] it up it's the word of God
[1:07:34] made manifest proven
[1:07:37] that it's right
[1:07:39] proven not by science but by God that is
[1:07:42] right God as I have said before in a
[1:07:45] message God doesn't need anyone to
[1:07:47] interpret his word he's his own
[1:07:49] interpreter he says it'll happen it
[1:07:52] happens that's he he confirms it that
[1:07:54] interprets it a few years ago when we
[1:07:57] Pentecostal people when the other
[1:08:00] churches told us that we were crazy we
[1:08:02] could not the Holy Ghost is the thing
[1:08:04] passed but we find out that God's
[1:08:06] promise was to whosoever Will and now we
[1:08:09] know different see that's just little by
[1:08:11] little this thing has opened up and now
[1:08:14] he promised that the Mysteries that was
[1:08:16] hidden those all those Church ages would
[1:08:19] be revealed right at the end time and it
[1:08:22] lets us know now we are at the end time
[1:08:26] we're here now now Satan is the author
[1:08:32] of civilization
[1:08:34] he is the author of science
[1:08:38] he is the author of Education
[1:08:41] you say is that true all right let us
[1:08:43] read in God's word now Genesis 4. and
[1:08:47] let's go back and just see for a minute
[1:08:48] I know I may if I get too long brother
[1:08:51] Carl will probably tell me but uh
[1:08:53] Genesis the fourth chapter in the 16th
[1:08:55] verse goes ahead telling here in the
[1:08:58] beginning what God did in order to place
[1:09:02] the curse upon the man and the woman and
[1:09:04] all that they was to do not the curse on
[1:09:06] them but tell them what would happen to
[1:09:08] curse the ground for Adam's sake and we
[1:09:11] find out here now that
[1:09:12] Eve had a pair of twins
[1:09:16] and one of them was of Satan and one of
[1:09:19] them was of God now you say oh no
[1:09:22] brother bran just a minute you find me
[1:09:24] one scripture anywhere that says that
[1:09:27] King was Adam's son
[1:09:29] I'll show you in the scripture where it
[1:09:31] says teen was all that evil one
[1:09:34] not Adam
[1:09:36] now notice when she conceived here we
[1:09:39] begin at the fourth chapter first and
[1:09:41] Adam knew his wife and she conceived in
[1:09:44] Bear King and said I have gotten she
[1:09:46] said now I have gotten a son from The
[1:09:48] Lord of course the head of you no matter
[1:09:50] if it's prostitute or anything had come
[1:09:51] from God see because that's the seed
[1:09:54] it's a law of a seed it has to bring
[1:09:55] forth whether it's corrupted seed
[1:09:57] perverted seed or whatever it is it's
[1:09:59] got to bring forth anyhow it's his
[1:10:01] command and she again bear his brother
[1:10:03] Abel no more knew him Adam knew his wife
[1:10:07] and she bear
[1:10:09] came
[1:10:11] and also bear Abel twins
[1:10:15] Satan was with her that morning Adam mad
[1:10:17] at you and you see the big bust in the
[1:10:18] paper here I believe in Tucson now that
[1:10:20] woman bringing forth a colored child and
[1:10:23] a white child at the same time she lived
[1:10:25] with her husband that morning and the
[1:10:26] man that afternoon and the man would
[1:10:28] take care of it the white man say take
[1:10:29] care of his own child but the colored
[1:10:31] man would have to take care of his own
[1:10:32] see I know that in breeding of dogs and
[1:10:35] so forth it certainly will if it's in a
[1:10:37] few hours afterwards this proves them
[1:10:39] now the show where civilization come
[1:10:42] from now let us read Genesis over here
[1:10:46] uh uh in the fourth chapter of Genesis
[1:10:49] again and see where the 16th verse and
[1:10:52] Cain went out from the presence of God
[1:10:55] and dwelt in the Land of Nod on the east
[1:10:58] side of Eden and Cain knew his wife and
[1:11:01] she conceived and bear enough
[1:11:03] and he built a city and called the name
[1:11:06] of the city after his son Ina
[1:11:10] civilization storm
[1:11:13] Dr Scofield here in my Scofield bible
[1:11:15] says the first civilization notice then
[1:11:19] he be got sons and they made organs and
[1:11:22] music the next one be God's sons and he
[1:11:25] began to do other things wonders build
[1:11:28] cities and and make uh instruments of
[1:11:31] brass and all kinds of things see that's
[1:11:34] what he did become the first
[1:11:36] civilization which was Canaanite
[1:11:43] he's done the same thing down to the
[1:11:46] ages
[1:11:48] now let's get there with the 25th verse
[1:11:51] and watch what's the next was and Adam
[1:11:53] knew his wife again
[1:11:56] now and she bear a son
[1:11:59] and call his name Seth for God said she
[1:12:02] has appointed me another seed instead of
[1:12:06] Abel who came soon and saith and to
[1:12:10] saith to him also there was born the son
[1:12:13] and he called his name Enos and then
[1:12:16] began man to call upon the name of the
[1:12:19] Lord
[1:12:19] out of the safe side not the Canaanite
[1:12:23] side see that great intellectual
[1:12:28] that we also hold to
[1:12:31] what's communism today what's their God
[1:12:35] it's the intellectual science
[1:12:41] what are we doing anyhow
[1:12:44] why are we living
[1:12:46] consider these words today
[1:12:54] do you want to keep going I don't care
[1:12:56] I'll sit here and listen to the whole
[1:12:58] thing I mean this is life to me
[1:13:02] you get the
[1:13:03] point
[1:13:05] right civilization education those
[1:13:08] things are of the Devil he's a what he's
[1:13:12] a deformer
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:16] so he said he said we're still the Sons
[1:13:18] and Daughters of God
[1:13:20] but we've been deformed
[1:13:22] so the the
[1:13:24] civilization and education and Science
[1:13:28] and all these things is is changing us
[1:13:32] from what that we're originally
[1:13:36] can do or if I could say it in another
[1:13:39] way it's hiding from us and keeping from
[1:13:43] us the power that we really have
[1:13:48] and so God's got a power and I think
[1:13:51] that uh we should be looking for that
[1:13:55] transforming power
[1:13:57] the power that can change us
[1:14:01] the the power that's within us to to be
[1:14:07] able to uh cause that change and
[1:14:11] so uh we we know that that he he just he
[1:14:17] laid this out in this great part because
[1:14:20] he wanted us to know that one came from
[1:14:24] one side and one come from the other
[1:14:26] and we're living in two Edens now
[1:14:30] right we're living in Satan's Eden right
[1:14:33] the God of this evil age Satan's Eden uh
[1:14:37] we're we're just at that time so what
[1:14:42] what are we building a wall between
[1:14:46] we're building a wall between the word
[1:14:50] and Satan's Eden
[1:14:53] that's what we're doing we have a place
[1:14:55] that we're living a place that we're
[1:14:57] protected a place that we come into he
[1:15:00] said education's fine he said but if it
[1:15:03] goes contrary to the word of God at all
[1:15:06] forget the education
[1:15:09] stay with God's word
[1:15:12] stay with God's word so we we so I
[1:15:15] wanted to point that out because that's
[1:15:17] the the thing so there's got to be
[1:15:20] something that makes that that Spirit
[1:15:24] come alive and so
[1:15:28] I'd like to just read this if I could he
[1:15:31] said
[1:15:33] and and you can put this up it starts at
[1:15:35] paragraph 103. if I was going to read it
[1:15:38] I should have probably just played it
[1:15:40] but it's my bad is that what they say my
[1:15:43] bad
[1:15:44] okay good
[1:15:46] anyway I want to be cool
[1:15:49] he says uh
[1:15:51] here notice the type of the two Edens
[1:15:55] so closely typed together
[1:15:58] till almost deceive the very elect
[1:16:04] that's why it's important that you
[1:16:07] understand you're elected
[1:16:09] okay because if you know you're elected
[1:16:12] then you know you're not subject to it
[1:16:15] you know I mean you've been set apart
[1:16:17] from it you don't have to go with the
[1:16:19] trend you don't have to go if they say
[1:16:22] oh if you don't go this way you won't
[1:16:23] survive yes I will
[1:16:26] I'm elected
[1:16:28] I don't care I I'm separated out I I got
[1:16:32] a different promise I live by a
[1:16:35] different code of ethics I live by faith
[1:16:38] I don't live by sight I live by promise
[1:16:42] I don't live by situation I don't live
[1:16:44] by perception I live by promise I live
[1:16:49] by God's word that's the first thing he
[1:16:52] emphasized right what we listen to
[1:16:53] whatever you do live by this word
[1:16:58] live by it you can trust it you can stay
[1:17:02] with it
[1:17:03] live by it get close to it
[1:17:07] that that's what we're talking about
[1:17:09] when we talked this morning about
[1:17:11] strengthing our hand in the work because
[1:17:13] Paul told Timothy Timothy study to show
[1:17:16] yourself approved know what he said know
[1:17:19] what I taught
[1:17:21] know the things that I've been opening
[1:17:23] up to you good to understand the
[1:17:26] understanding that I'm trying to give
[1:17:28] you understand you try to get people to
[1:17:31] think a certain way
[1:17:33] people go to business college people go
[1:17:35] to law school law school they want you
[1:17:38] to think a certain way
[1:17:41] don't believe anything you hear ask
[1:17:44] questions about it no matter what story
[1:17:47] they tell you pick it apart get to the
[1:17:50] facts
[1:17:52] you know what I mean it don't matter how
[1:17:55] sympathetic or how emotional you are the
[1:17:58] judge isn't going to rule on your
[1:18:00] emotions he's going to rule on the law
[1:18:03] you've got to present your case in the
[1:18:05] law you've got to have facts
[1:18:10] you know okay and and if you if you're
[1:18:12] in a trial and and you say a certain
[1:18:15] thing and it's not clear it's ambiguous
[1:18:18] in any form the other side will will
[1:18:21] stand up because I object to that
[1:18:25] it's hearsay it's it's subjective or
[1:18:29] you're badgering the witness any any
[1:18:31] kind of thing
[1:18:33] like when prophet of God preached his
[1:18:35] first sermon you remember he tells the
[1:18:37] story he said all the ladies were all
[1:18:40] crying on the front and everything and
[1:18:43] he said I was all puffed up and now I
[1:18:45] thought I really did a job and he said I
[1:18:47] walked into Brother David said how'd I
[1:18:49] do he said worst I ever heard
[1:18:55] you know he said oh the wind went out of
[1:18:57] myself he said what do you mean he said
[1:18:59] bill
[1:19:00] he says that remind me of the time in
[1:19:03] court
[1:19:04] and this attorney was just boohooing on
[1:19:07] he's finally the guy couldn't take it up
[1:19:09] and he already said your honor how much
[1:19:11] longer are we going to listen to this
[1:19:15] you know he said bill it was great but
[1:19:17] there wasn't one bit of word in it
[1:19:22] that pet the thing so what what are what
[1:19:26] why are we our wall that we're building
[1:19:29] what are we trying to keep in our lives
[1:19:31] we're trying to keep the word in there
[1:19:34] we're trying to keep the Word of Promise
[1:19:36] alive we we've got promises
[1:19:41] the god gaveth there it was called the
[1:19:43] promised land in Shadow and type right
[1:19:47] it was a land that he promised the land
[1:19:50] of milk and honey of good land a land
[1:19:52] that could provide a land that would
[1:19:54] support him they came back and brought
[1:19:56] the evidence of that lamb great big
[1:19:59] great leaves and and and the honey and
[1:20:03] fruit and everything and they said it's
[1:20:05] everything that he said it would be
[1:20:09] oh but there's a big old Giants in that
[1:20:13] land
[1:20:14] Joshua and Caleb said we're more than
[1:20:16] able
[1:20:17] to take it because this is as I redist
[1:20:21] just think of it here he says
[1:20:25] the two Edens
[1:20:26] he says in Matthew 24 24 said that it
[1:20:31] would it would be that way but I want us
[1:20:34] to stop for a few moments and to
[1:20:37] consider these two Edens and the one
[1:20:40] thing especially how the Bible tells us
[1:20:43] that God's word did produce that Eden
[1:20:48] and how God's word warns us
[1:20:52] that the other Eden would come
[1:21:00] that's something
[1:21:01] a great statement isn't it
[1:21:04] if you take time to read them
[1:21:07] he said God made the one Eden and he
[1:21:10] warned us that this other Eden was going
[1:21:12] to come
[1:21:13] right he says now we also know that
[1:21:17] there has got to be another Eden if we
[1:21:20] would also listen to The Prophet Paul in
[1:21:23] second Thessalonians the second chapter
[1:21:25] I could read it if you wanted to
[1:21:28] he who exalts himself that day will not
[1:21:32] come of the Lord until that man of sin
[1:21:36] be revealed
[1:21:38] who who sits in the temple of God
[1:21:41] exalting himself above all that is
[1:21:43] called God so that he as God is
[1:21:47] worshiped as God
[1:21:50] why what what was inside of those walls
[1:21:55] of Jerusalem it was the temple
[1:21:58] our place of worship
[1:22:00] right that's that's what we're we we've
[1:22:03] got we we don't want to worship a false
[1:22:06] image
[1:22:08] the Trinity is idol worship
[1:22:13] we don't want no idols
[1:22:16] right we want to worship what he is I
[1:22:19] don't want to worship a man-made image
[1:22:22] of Jesus
[1:22:23] some brothers were telling me today at
[1:22:26] lunch about uh some of these Productions
[1:22:30] in these
[1:22:33] Hollywood Easter
[1:22:35] programs that were going on and all the
[1:22:39] light flashing and everything and they
[1:22:42] call that God
[1:22:44] that's not God
[1:22:47] has never changed
[1:22:50] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:53] forever
[1:22:54] and so he says and think of that
[1:22:58] he says now Isaiah the prophet said that
[1:23:01] he saw Lucifer in his heart
[1:23:05] through a vision under inspiration of
[1:23:08] God saying he would do that Isaiah 800
[1:23:13] years before Paul or approximately that
[1:23:17] now here 800 years later Paul sees him
[1:23:20] comes to his position no one is its head
[1:23:25] up his Eden his scientific Eden with his
[1:23:31] scientific world with his scientific
[1:23:34] bride Church all under the word of
[1:23:38] knowledge great seminaries great great
[1:23:41] decrees educational programs listen
[1:23:44] brothers and sisters
[1:23:47] each one of us is going to walk that
[1:23:50] road that Florence walk
[1:23:52] I ask you
[1:23:54] in Jesus name to consider this
[1:23:59] not consider me I'm your brother that
[1:24:03] isn't it
[1:24:04] consider the word that I am speaking of
[1:24:09] God's Bible
[1:24:10] and look through perfectly Vindicated in
[1:24:15] God's Own word in the age we're living
[1:24:18] in where we're at
[1:24:23] so what do we know what's he just
[1:24:26] talking about he's talking about the
[1:24:28] deformer
[1:24:31] the deformer has never been working like
[1:24:34] he's working now
[1:24:37] look at oh can you see it this is
[1:24:40] supposed to be the age of as it was in
[1:24:43] the days of Solomon Gomorrah well he's
[1:24:46] deforming human beings
[1:24:53] I mean forming our children and and and
[1:24:58] and
[1:25:00] it just it just kind of deforming this
[1:25:04] and deforming that and taking this down
[1:25:07] and taking that down like I said this
[1:25:10] morning he's trying to do away with all
[1:25:12] the lines
[1:25:15] everything's so ambiguous
[1:25:19] that you can hardly find God
[1:25:25] you know with what's right and wrong
[1:25:30] is hard to understand
[1:25:34] I mean our thinking
[1:25:36] has been deformed
[1:25:40] I mean you know
[1:25:43] this is just a reality that we live in
[1:25:47] they they decided that they would never
[1:25:51] they they would no longer prosecute any
[1:25:55] theft
[1:25:58] under 800 dollars
[1:26:02] did you know that
[1:26:05] certain States
[1:26:07] if someone would go into a store and
[1:26:09] start stealing things they're told not
[1:26:13] to interfere
[1:26:15] and you say well why would they do that
[1:26:18] do you understand there's a thinking
[1:26:20] behind it
[1:26:21] and they're thinking behind it is it
[1:26:24] it's a it's a form of equity
[1:26:31] so if the people that don't have steal
[1:26:34] from the people that have
[1:26:37] then they are now in they've got
[1:26:39] something that they have and now they're
[1:26:42] in a more Equitable position
[1:26:46] it's it's a deformed thinking
[1:26:53] you know let's make everybody equal
[1:26:56] let's spread it around
[1:26:59] let's just do it and say it's a way of
[1:27:02] thinking they feel it's Progressive
[1:27:06] they're trying to save a dying universe
[1:27:10] right
[1:27:11] well they they they they might call it
[1:27:14] the uh the green New Deal
[1:27:18] they don't have their own new deals for
[1:27:21] this Earth
[1:27:23] how many knows what's going to happen to
[1:27:25] this earth
[1:27:27] it's going to burn
[1:27:30] I do not have environmental anxiety
[1:27:36] because I had a prophet tell me that the
[1:27:39] bride would not go into the tribulation
[1:27:42] amen I've got a ticket
[1:27:45] it's inside of me it's the power to
[1:27:48] transform me out of this before it burns
[1:27:53] God's got the power to transform he's
[1:27:57] got the power to take me out he's got
[1:27:59] the power to keep me he's got the power
[1:28:02] to make me be able to live and be his
[1:28:04] son and his daughter I'm looking for
[1:28:07] that power
[1:28:10] because I know it exists
[1:28:13] I know the power is within me to
[1:28:16] overcome it's in the seed
[1:28:19] and if all's I got to now is look for
[1:28:21] the spirit that quickens the seed
[1:28:28] it would be so close it would deceive
[1:28:30] the very elect
[1:28:32] you say the rain falls on the just and
[1:28:35] the unjust yes the rain falls they both
[1:28:37] jump up and shout but I'm looking for
[1:28:40] the one that's sure if I shout that's
[1:28:41] great but I want it to go beyond the
[1:28:44] shout and make the seed in me come to
[1:28:46] life
[1:28:48] the word come to life in me
[1:28:51] amen and so we we see it he says
[1:28:57] he said the age that we're living in now
[1:29:00] these programs are absolutely Antichrist
[1:29:06] in themselves
[1:29:10] now he has got to have an Eden
[1:29:13] he said he would do it
[1:29:15] here is the simple word of God saying
[1:29:19] that he would do it
[1:29:21] and here we're looking right out and
[1:29:24] seeing him
[1:29:26] do it
[1:29:29] we're watching them do it
[1:29:33] I mean it's it's insane
[1:29:36] we're watching them do it
[1:29:39] they want to do away with gold they want
[1:29:41] to do it with money they want to do away
[1:29:43] with cars they want to put everybody on
[1:29:46] batteries I don't want to be on nothing
[1:29:49] that runs out
[1:29:54] you know what I mean
[1:29:58] remember that big freeze we had
[1:30:01] and all the electricity was
[1:30:04] shut down
[1:30:06] we had a lot of them gas Savers stuck in
[1:30:08] Houston
[1:30:14] well I'm not trusting any of that the
[1:30:17] main thing I don't want is I don't want
[1:30:19] the spirit cut off
[1:30:22] I don't want him to deform me or I can't
[1:30:26] hear from God where I don't look for the
[1:30:29] spirit that's why you've got to get in
[1:30:31] the spirit
[1:30:32] you've got to set up time the carnal
[1:30:35] mind is against God but the spiritual
[1:30:38] mind is life and it's liberty you
[1:30:44] take away
[1:30:47] from the thinking of this world and
[1:30:50] understand that there's another mind
[1:30:52] it's a spiritual mind it's a word mind
[1:30:56] you've got to tap into it that's what
[1:30:59] charges your battery
[1:31:04] got to be charged up
[1:31:10] we've got to walk in the spirit as he is
[1:31:13] in the spirit
[1:31:14] we kind of get into the spirit of the of
[1:31:18] of the city that we're living in
[1:31:20] of the land that we're living in where
[1:31:23] the temple is of worshiping and and
[1:31:26] having a life set aside for him and and
[1:31:30] touching on the promises and living by
[1:31:33] the promises and looking to the promises
[1:31:36] to be quickened
[1:31:38] I I want the promises of God
[1:31:42] transformed from promise
[1:31:45] to Vindication in me and made flesh
[1:31:51] that's what I mean I want to see the
[1:31:54] promise come from seed to fruit yes
[1:32:00] to exactly what it is that he said I was
[1:32:05] here to become
[1:32:09] right that's what his power is his power
[1:32:11] is to transform us to become what that
[1:32:15] he put us here to become
[1:32:17] and what did he put us here to become he
[1:32:21] put us here in this day you and I that's
[1:32:24] sitting in this room to become that
[1:32:27] statue of a perfect man to become in the
[1:32:30] image of his son
[1:32:32] with all these virtues that was his
[1:32:36] attributes on display and to be capped
[1:32:40] with the love of God shed abroad in our
[1:32:43] heart
[1:32:46] that is not offered
[1:32:50] by the deformer
[1:32:54] the deformer offers compromise
[1:32:59] he's a mixer
[1:33:02] let's mix a little of this with a little
[1:33:05] of that
[1:33:07] you know what happens when you mix a
[1:33:09] little of God and a little of the world
[1:33:11] together what you get you get religion
[1:33:17] I don't want religion
[1:33:19] I want the reality of the seed that's in
[1:33:24] me
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:26] I want what it was
[1:33:29] that the prophet of God talked about he
[1:33:32] planted in everything in order the seed
[1:33:35] that's in me that he planted to bring
[1:33:38] forth
[1:33:40] what he had in his mind for me to be
[1:33:43] that's what I want to make contact with
[1:33:46] sure that's what I want the spirit to
[1:33:49] Quicken that's what I want to come in
[1:33:52] life I don't want to transform into a
[1:33:55] religious form I don't want to be
[1:33:57] transformed into a conformity
[1:34:02] but I want to come to that image of that
[1:34:05] man that he told me that that he had in
[1:34:09] mind for me because I'm his workmanship
[1:34:13] foreordained unto good works that I
[1:34:16] should walk in them
[1:34:18] so I want to seek
[1:34:21] what are those works
[1:34:24] what would you have me to do what
[1:34:27] attributes do I have well Lord I know
[1:34:30] you've put me or for a reason I know you
[1:34:33] put me here for a purpose I know that
[1:34:35] you love bring that alive in me make
[1:34:38] that come out in me
[1:34:42] I'm gonna wall out
[1:34:44] all these other things till I make
[1:34:47] contact with that and I'm gonna I'm
[1:34:50] asking you to reveal that to me and give
[1:34:53] me the revelation of it that I can walk
[1:34:55] in it in confidence
[1:34:58] amen
[1:35:00] then I can walk up to somebody and say
[1:35:02] friend I you look like you're down you
[1:35:05] look like you're heartbroken you look
[1:35:07] like you're under a lot of Burden I'd
[1:35:10] like to pray for you
[1:35:12] there's promises in God's word God said
[1:35:14] he's a present help in the time of
[1:35:17] trouble
[1:35:18] and and I want to be there for you
[1:35:21] and not be embarrassed
[1:35:25] but you know Satan's always that oh if
[1:35:27] you go do that you'll be a fool or
[1:35:30] they'll reject you
[1:35:32] you know he's got all this mind battle
[1:35:35] before you get there
[1:35:38] I want to overcome that battle I want to
[1:35:40] possess that gate when he says doubt I
[1:35:44] want to say word
[1:35:46] when he says stop I want to say wait a
[1:35:48] minute the word told me to go
[1:35:52] I want to tell him to get behind me
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:35:56] you say well can I do that yes
[1:35:59] you're made to do it you're created to
[1:36:02] do it you're the same creation that was
[1:36:05] in the garden that had power over all
[1:36:09] the things and everything was set in
[1:36:11] order and you were to look out after it
[1:36:15] we just heard him say it
[1:36:17] but something's deformed us
[1:36:20] right and we know what that is don't we
[1:36:23] science
[1:36:25] education civilization
[1:36:29] he's the creator of it all
[1:36:32] and now we're absolutely being called
[1:36:35] out in this hour to be Overcomers
[1:36:39] let's just read on just a little bit
[1:36:42] these programs are absolutely Antichrist
[1:36:44] in themselves now he has got to have an
[1:36:47] Eden he said he would do it and here is
[1:36:50] the simple word of God saying that he
[1:36:54] would do it and here we are looking
[1:36:56] right and seeing him do it
[1:36:59] he has done it with his intellectual
[1:37:02] scientific denominational bride
[1:37:06] he is going to take
[1:37:09] head one of these days in a world
[1:37:12] Council of churches that will be set up
[1:37:15] and will be with him
[1:37:17] trying
[1:37:19] the people not because they're bad
[1:37:21] people
[1:37:22] they were planted in straight row like
[1:37:27] corn
[1:37:28] but Satan sold the creepers
[1:37:32] called science
[1:37:35] research
[1:37:37] education
[1:37:39] doctor's degrees
[1:37:41] sometimes they won't even let you in the
[1:37:44] Pulpit unless you can produce a doctor's
[1:37:47] degree
[1:37:48] from some Seminary somewhere it's all
[1:37:52] wrong
[1:37:54] so what were those things they're
[1:37:56] creepers
[1:37:57] you understand so if we can build a
[1:38:00] distinct line
[1:38:02] remember what he just talked about you
[1:38:04] got to hold them out hold them out if
[1:38:07] you don't hold them out they'll wrap you
[1:38:09] up you'll still be the corn
[1:38:12] but you're so deformed you can't be
[1:38:15] recognized anymore and I think that's
[1:38:17] what's happened to the church is we
[1:38:20] can't recognize ourselves anymore for
[1:38:23] what that we really are
[1:38:26] we've been defeated and lied to so much
[1:38:29] by Satan remember God can't lie
[1:38:33] but Satan's the father of Lies there's
[1:38:36] no truth in them
[1:38:38] that we don't recognize ourselves
[1:38:42] and that's one of the things we've got
[1:38:44] to do we've got to recognize ourselves
[1:38:46] as the elect we've got to recognize our
[1:38:49] calling we've got to recognize that we
[1:38:53] have heard the voice that we've heard
[1:38:57] and it's a trumpet
[1:38:59] it's not an uncertain sound it's calling
[1:39:03] us to something it's not calling us to
[1:39:07] sit back and say I believe William
[1:39:09] branham's the prophet of God
[1:39:13] well that's like knowing you got a
[1:39:15] mailman but never opening the box
[1:39:22] I mean you can keep stuffing the letters
[1:39:24] in the Box you know what I mean until
[1:39:26] finally he puts a little slip in there
[1:39:30] and says they're all down at the post
[1:39:32] office
[1:39:36] well that's like this Kevin quote
[1:39:38] stuffed on you everything's stuffed in
[1:39:41] you and then finally saying well there's
[1:39:42] a whole 1100 tapes over here no you've
[1:39:46] got to start opening them up you got to
[1:39:48] start reading them you got to read those
[1:39:51] promises and when you hear a promise of
[1:39:53] God you ought to sit there and say Lord
[1:39:55] send the power that transforms this from
[1:40:00] promise into life
[1:40:05] then we'll start claiming our
[1:40:07] inheritance all right
[1:40:09] we'll start taking back from Satan
[1:40:13] what what he squatted on
[1:40:16] have you ever seen so much controversy
[1:40:19] that's going on out there in the news
[1:40:21] about squatters
[1:40:28] you know sometimes I think I just ought
[1:40:30] to quit reading the newspaper
[1:40:33] they're squatters everywhere squatters
[1:40:36] squatters
[1:40:37] they move in on your property and they
[1:40:39] sit in there and they live in there
[1:40:42] and you hold the title deed
[1:40:46] he doesn't have any right on your
[1:40:48] property he doesn't have any right to
[1:40:50] your possessions he doesn't have any
[1:40:53] right to hold your promise from you
[1:40:56] but you've got to like the prophet of
[1:40:58] God said you've got to go out and twist
[1:41:01] it out of the greasy hand of the enemy
[1:41:05] look that code up
[1:41:07] you got to take it from him amen
[1:41:10] you got to say it's mine I'm elected to
[1:41:13] it I'm called to it I'm ordained to it
[1:41:16] there's a seed inside of me that's
[1:41:19] calling to bear this fruit and you can't
[1:41:22] deform me from producing these fruits of
[1:41:26] the spirit that I'm supposed to have
[1:41:28] amen
[1:41:30] I want him in my life amen
[1:41:33] amen I want a love
[1:41:36] I want to be patient I want to be kind I
[1:41:39] want to have temperance
[1:41:42] I want those things
[1:41:45] I want to have them on displayed
[1:41:50] I'm not saying I'm there
[1:41:53] not what I ought to be I'm not what I
[1:41:55] want to be but I'm not what I used to be
[1:41:58] I thank God for that but I want Christ
[1:42:01] to live
[1:42:03] in me
[1:42:06] and I'm not going to set be beat down
[1:42:10] because the accuser tells me I haven't
[1:42:13] obtained yet
[1:42:18] the promise isn't the the obtaining
[1:42:22] the promise is that there's a power
[1:42:25] there that will transform me
[1:42:30] so that's what I'm seeking I'm not
[1:42:33] looking at my failures I'm looking at a
[1:42:36] power that can take me from my failures
[1:42:38] to my big my victory
[1:42:42] that's what I'm looking for that's what
[1:42:44] I want to con come into contact with
[1:42:46] that's what I want to have an experience
[1:42:48] with God's power to transform God's
[1:42:52] power to change things
[1:42:55] that's what I'm looking for
[1:42:59] all those guys that started building
[1:43:02] that wall
[1:43:03] they said God will provide they were
[1:43:06] looking to the grace and mercy and power
[1:43:09] of God to have them to be able to
[1:43:12] perform the task that they set forth to
[1:43:15] do
[1:43:16] and no matter how the enemy come against
[1:43:18] it they were going to do it whether they
[1:43:21] had to work with a tool in one hand and
[1:43:23] a sword in the other Satan you want to
[1:43:25] stop I'll fight you with one hand and
[1:43:27] I'll claim the promise with the other
[1:43:29] Hallelujah
[1:43:37] he said
[1:43:40] he says and it's all wrong
[1:43:43] not the people
[1:43:45] it's the programs
[1:43:47] that's wrong
[1:43:51] you know the prophet of God said Leslie
[1:43:53] rest reading me the quote this afternoon
[1:43:55] he says when your brother offends you
[1:43:57] never hold that against your brother
[1:44:01] it was the devil that did that
[1:44:06] in fact a lot of people wouldn't do the
[1:44:09] things they did if it wasn't for the
[1:44:10] devil
[1:44:11] and some things we do ourselves were not
[1:44:14] too bright a lot of times and we try to
[1:44:16] blame it on the devil
[1:44:18] but he's not that dumb
[1:44:24] you can strike that from the wreck
[1:44:32] he said it's all headed up again
[1:44:36] he said the whole program's wrong
[1:44:38] and now what's it done
[1:44:41] it's all headed up again and brought up
[1:44:44] the whole entire world
[1:44:47] through a bunch of hybriding perversion
[1:44:50] of the Original Seed of God to another
[1:44:54] dark chaos
[1:44:57] right
[1:44:59] now how many she's the chaos
[1:45:06] you know you got to be
[1:45:11] and yet the word of God says be careful
[1:45:13] for nothing
[1:45:15] you know if you're living God's words
[1:45:17] you don't have to be careful
[1:45:20] if you tell the truth you don't have to
[1:45:22] remember what you said last time
[1:45:26] the first scientific Christian is what
[1:45:29] honesty
[1:45:31] just be honest
[1:45:34] just tell your friend say friend I
[1:45:37] really don't like you but I'm praying
[1:45:39] real hard that I do
[1:45:44] well sometimes you can just be quiet
[1:45:54] but I'm so glad that God is mindful of
[1:45:57] us again hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:01] I'm so glad you're
[1:46:05] here God is mindful of us you say is
[1:46:08] that scripture for today he said it then
[1:46:12] but while he was saying it he was
[1:46:15] storing up
[1:46:17] all this food
[1:46:19] for you because you were the ones that's
[1:46:23] going to need it
[1:46:24] I wish I had that quote he says I'm
[1:46:27] saying all this stuff now he says but
[1:46:29] there's a generation coming
[1:46:34] amen right well you wanted to say who
[1:46:36] that generation is I'm that generation
[1:46:38] I'm the generation that came after the
[1:46:41] message left
[1:46:43] all right
[1:46:46] I'm the generation that had to live off
[1:46:48] the tapes
[1:46:51] I had to live out of the storehouse
[1:46:55] would I wish I would have been there
[1:46:57] possibly so
[1:46:59] but I accept where God put me blessed is
[1:47:03] he who believeth
[1:47:05] and see it now right
[1:47:09] I'm happy to take the blessing
[1:47:12] prophet's reward
[1:47:15] I'm happy to take that
[1:47:17] I'm so glad he's mindful of again that
[1:47:20] he can still move upon the face of the
[1:47:23] conditions
[1:47:27] right
[1:47:29] all this condition all this perversion
[1:47:31] all this science he can still move upon
[1:47:34] it he can still move upon the chaos in
[1:47:37] other words what's he telling us it's
[1:47:39] dark it's bad but church I can still
[1:47:42] move on you I can still move through you
[1:47:46] I can still use you you can still be a
[1:47:50] Shining Light
[1:47:51] you're still my elect lady
[1:47:54] you still have a calling I still have a
[1:47:57] work there's a seed in you I want to
[1:48:00] transform Lord move on me yeah
[1:48:03] amen move on my condition
[1:48:08] you say I'm back said move on my
[1:48:10] backslid
[1:48:11] I've got doubt move on my doubt I've got
[1:48:15] bitterness move on my bitterness
[1:48:18] move on the condition
[1:48:21] because there's a seed in me that's
[1:48:24] crying out there's a deep in me calling
[1:48:27] to a deep
[1:48:29] that you promised you would transform me
[1:48:31] into the seed that I'm supposed to be
[1:48:35] I'm so glad for that
[1:48:39] face of the condition he promised he
[1:48:42] would do it
[1:48:43] and call a little flock which would be
[1:48:47] his
[1:48:48] bride
[1:48:52] that's the call
[1:48:56] I'm listening for sure
[1:49:00] you say well I I want to work go work in
[1:49:03] that
[1:49:04] you want to be at the engineer you want
[1:49:06] to be a rocket scientist no problem
[1:49:13] don't talk to me about Rockets
[1:49:16] be like talking to a canary
[1:49:19] but it's okay
[1:49:23] but don't substitute
[1:49:26] the calling of God
[1:49:28] the calling of the little bride the
[1:49:31] calling to Perfection the calling to a
[1:49:34] statue of a perfect man the call to the
[1:49:37] image of Christ the call to the Capstone
[1:49:40] don't let none of these things deter you
[1:49:42] from that no matter what you're doing
[1:49:44] whether you're in construction whether
[1:49:46] you're in sales whether you're in
[1:49:48] medicine whether you're in medical
[1:49:49] whether it no matter what field you're
[1:49:52] in you're trying to manifest Christ in
[1:49:54] that field
[1:49:59] no matter what you are
[1:50:02] or where you are
[1:50:04] we let our light shine that our good
[1:50:07] works might glorify Our Father in heaven
[1:50:12] we are not shortened any wise if God be
[1:50:16] for us
[1:50:17] who can be against us
[1:50:20] so we're we're looking for that okay
[1:50:23] this this calling that the call
[1:50:27] of the little flock
[1:50:29] that's a good name for a sermon isn't it
[1:50:31] the call of the little flock
[1:50:34] Hallelujah
[1:50:37] which would be his bride notice here
[1:50:40] again how perfectly these churches type
[1:50:43] are these Edens
[1:50:47] God threw a seed of his word yes
[1:50:51] how's he going to do it
[1:50:55] through the seed of his word
[1:50:58] how's he going to call this bride
[1:51:00] through the seed of his word
[1:51:08] it's almost like saying the bride was in
[1:51:10] the seed
[1:51:15] you were he knew you right sure the
[1:51:19] color of your hair is the color of your
[1:51:20] eyes exactly where you'd be the statue
[1:51:22] would be in but believe me you haven't
[1:51:25] surprised God
[1:51:30] you think any of you have surprised God
[1:51:36] you are
[1:51:37] such a little surprise for God
[1:51:41] that he died for your sins before you
[1:51:43] did them
[1:51:46] now that's somebody that knows the
[1:51:48] beginning from the end
[1:51:52] it's got a time for restoration
[1:51:55] he's got a time for everything sometimes
[1:51:58] we think people are away from God their
[1:52:00] backslid even God takes the permissive
[1:52:02] will and works it to the perfect will we
[1:52:06] have a God that's in control all he
[1:52:09] wants us to do is to start removing the
[1:52:12] deformer out of our life he wants us to
[1:52:15] build out walls against the deformer
[1:52:17] quit listening to the lies of the enemy
[1:52:20] start telling Satan to get back to where
[1:52:22] he's belonged and for us to start taking
[1:52:24] our position in Christ
[1:52:28] simple
[1:52:32] it's simple
[1:52:35] who's making it complicated
[1:52:38] your brain
[1:52:42] because that's where the battle is
[1:52:45] you've got to start winning the battle
[1:52:47] in your mind
[1:52:50] he gave you the weapons over the Mind
[1:52:53] battle if God could give you any better
[1:52:57] weapon he would have done it sure what
[1:53:00] did he give you he gave you his word
[1:53:05] doesn't matter if Satan appears of an
[1:53:08] angel of Light give him a word test
[1:53:15] the word will expose him every time
[1:53:20] he said God threw a seed of his word
[1:53:24] and there's only one thing that can
[1:53:27] Quicken the word and that is the spirit
[1:53:32] right
[1:53:34] that's what we're looking for
[1:53:37] we're not looking for Sensations those
[1:53:40] Sensations are good
[1:53:42] I like to get happy I like to laugh
[1:53:47] you know someone says something that's
[1:53:49] funny I you know you like just to laugh
[1:53:51] and I like to laugh until I have to yeah
[1:53:55] Catch My Breath we call it snorting
[1:54:01] I like to do that
[1:54:04] I like to just get excited and and and
[1:54:06] just thank God
[1:54:09] you know I was talking with Ron Peterson
[1:54:12] the other day we just got done talking
[1:54:13] about the time that we pulled the car
[1:54:16] over on the side of the road and was
[1:54:18] just running around that car shouting
[1:54:20] the Praises of God and everything he
[1:54:22] finally said to me says you know Brother
[1:54:24] David I think people are going down the
[1:54:26] road thinking that we were chasing one
[1:54:28] another to kill each other
[1:54:31] and we started getting dizzy going one
[1:54:33] way so we turned around and ran around
[1:54:35] the car the other way
[1:54:38] we just got excited about we were
[1:54:41] elected
[1:54:42] as years ago on Flagstaff we realized we
[1:54:45] weren't in California
[1:54:48] what we realized that what he brought us
[1:54:50] out of what he had transformed us to was
[1:54:53] God done transforming us no
[1:54:57] but praise God the power of
[1:55:00] transformation was working
[1:55:05] that's what I love
[1:55:07] so he planted the seed right God through
[1:55:10] the seed word and there's only one thing
[1:55:12] that can Quicken that word and that's
[1:55:15] the spirit
[1:55:17] the spirit is the purpose
[1:55:20] for which God planted the seed that's
[1:55:23] the spirit of the seed the spirit of an
[1:55:27] orange seed is and orange
[1:55:33] that's the manifested fruit of the
[1:55:36] orange
[1:55:40] now if you came to my house
[1:55:42] and asked me for an orange and I gave
[1:55:45] you a seed
[1:55:49] you would say well brother McGarry
[1:55:51] that's not what I wanted I said oh I
[1:55:53] gave you thousands of oranges
[1:55:57] what are you griping about
[1:56:00] that you have to put a little labor into
[1:56:02] it you have to put a little work into it
[1:56:04] you've got to do a little cultivation
[1:56:08] that's what we're like
[1:56:11] God gave us himself in seed form he's
[1:56:14] our father
[1:56:16] he put a seed in us which is him
[1:56:23] in a form that can grow into his son and
[1:56:27] daughter
[1:56:29] marriage and the Earthly was all a tight
[1:56:33] didn't you hear what he just said in the
[1:56:35] message he said sure this seed came from
[1:56:37] God
[1:56:39] because the seed had a law
[1:56:41] it would bring forth of its kind so if
[1:56:45] God threw seed put his seed in it then
[1:56:48] that seed has to produce God hallelujah
[1:56:55] it can produce nothing else
[1:56:59] but you got to keep the deformers out
[1:57:01] you've got to build the wall out you got
[1:57:04] to water it yeah
[1:57:07] you can't keep digging it up
[1:57:11] he said you don't plant corn and and go
[1:57:13] out there and dig it up
[1:57:16] you got to let it run its course
[1:57:20] and the Sea of God is running its course
[1:57:23] in the elected
[1:57:25] some of you might have been planted
[1:57:26] later or sooner
[1:57:29] I don't know that
[1:57:31] I know there's an 11th Hour worker
[1:57:37] I don't know what hour was assigned to
[1:57:39] me
[1:57:41] maybe I'm a seventh hour worker
[1:57:44] you know but I remember there's one
[1:57:47] thing that they were called
[1:57:49] workers
[1:57:52] there's no 11th Hour slouches
[1:57:56] there's no 11th Hour bums
[1:58:00] there's no 11th Hour lazy Christians
[1:58:04] it's given to those to be adopted that
[1:58:07] are about the father's business
[1:58:12] but I'm excited
[1:58:15] you say well I haven't been about this
[1:58:17] business what you need is a taste of the
[1:58:20] quickening power
[1:58:23] that's what you pray for you pray for
[1:58:25] Revelation you pray for the touch not a
[1:58:29] touch for something that only lasts for
[1:58:32] a service or two sure
[1:58:35] and we've got to have that I like
[1:58:38] worshiping the Lord don't you
[1:58:41] know that song we sang today you know uh
[1:58:45] I love you Lord You Know listen oh I
[1:58:49] wish we'd just sing that for 10 minutes
[1:58:51] sometime so she she just likes to put it
[1:58:54] on her radio in her car and just listen
[1:58:56] you know
[1:58:57] I I just like it it's like me I put that
[1:59:00] song on there is a blood I just play it
[1:59:03] over and over again wear that thing out
[1:59:05] because I can't wear the blood out I
[1:59:07] might as well wear the tape out
[1:59:12] we like that
[1:59:13] right but
[1:59:15] these things we will do if God so
[1:59:19] permits but let us move on to perfection
[1:59:23] so look at what he says he said God
[1:59:26] through the seed of his word and there's
[1:59:28] only one thing that can Quicken that
[1:59:30] word and that's the spirit for it is the
[1:59:33] life Giver to the word that's what we
[1:59:38] want Lord I've got the seed
[1:59:41] I recognize my desire to overcome now
[1:59:45] Lord I need the life-giver give me the
[1:59:48] life that brings This Promise alive in
[1:59:52] me
[1:59:55] for your healing for your deliverance
[1:59:57] for your overcoming for your peace of
[1:59:59] mind for your loved one for your
[2:00:01] children it don't matter what it is
[2:00:03] there's a life Giver
[2:00:05] Amen to the word it's the power to
[2:00:08] transform that word a promise to reality
[2:00:14] I like it
[2:00:16] amen I want it
[2:00:18] Is For Real
[2:00:20] it's for whosoever will
[2:00:23] how many member of the prophet of God
[2:00:24] said that just in what we listen to
[2:00:29] you
[2:00:30] for whosoever will
[2:00:32] I will
[2:00:35] That's The Vow
[2:00:37] I will
[2:00:39] I do
[2:00:42] that's our marriage vow with him I will
[2:00:46] I do
[2:00:51] will you have them will you hold them
[2:00:52] will you keep them I will I will
[2:00:56] I want his will
[2:01:01] he said
[2:01:02] for it's the life-giver to the word and
[2:01:05] when the life
[2:01:07] in the word
[2:01:09] meets the life of the spirit it produces
[2:01:13] whatever the seed is
[2:01:18] Hallelujah
[2:01:20] right so my part
[2:01:23] when the life in the word
[2:01:28] that's the word that he put in me
[2:01:31] the seed is the life of the word meets
[2:01:34] the life of the spirit
[2:01:37] that's when he takes his spirit
[2:01:41] and quickens
[2:01:42] let's Quicken mean
[2:01:45] s alive
[2:01:47] that word a promise that's in you it'll
[2:01:50] produce whatever the seed is
[2:01:54] oh my
[2:01:57] God you like that yes
[2:01:59] yes does anybody want to shout
[2:02:01] Hallelujah
[2:02:07] it's good stuff
[2:02:09] is life
[2:02:11] it's glorious
[2:02:13] amen I would I would tell you the run
[2:02:16] but you'd break your neck and that's
[2:02:18] just how crowded it is
[2:02:20] but we're going to have some Running
[2:02:22] Room pretty soon
[2:02:24] so you just feel get ready but don't run
[2:02:27] without the spirit
[2:02:33] now let's add a little bit of sobriety
[2:02:36] here for a moment
[2:02:37] and let's turn to paragraph 188
[2:02:46] and we'll close him
[2:02:48] because we're still talking about the
[2:02:50] walls of our life and why we're building
[2:02:52] in it and what is inside the city for
[2:02:56] the believer
[2:02:59] and he just makes this quick statement
[2:03:02] in 182. he says in paragraph 182
[2:03:08] he says
[2:03:09] so it seems to be now
[2:03:12] so hard for people to Humble themselves
[2:03:16] to the word of God
[2:03:19] they just don't want to do it
[2:03:22] they'll handle themselves to a Creed of
[2:03:25] a church but not to the word of God now
[2:03:29] let's jump over to paragraph 88.
[2:03:33] and so
[2:03:36] don't let anybody tell you that it's any
[2:03:40] other way than what the prophet said
[2:03:44] the prophets didn't even understand what
[2:03:47] they were saying
[2:03:49] Moses didn't miss anything Isaiah didn't
[2:03:52] miss anything none of they just said
[2:03:54] what God told them to say
[2:03:56] they didn't even know why they said it
[2:03:59] right they didn't understand it
[2:04:02] you know just like in the scripture
[2:04:04] where the the scripture says the world
[2:04:07] was without form or void
[2:04:10] well we understand that more than
[2:04:12] anybody
[2:04:14] I mean man people were looking at it
[2:04:16] from this side of the word
[2:04:18] and they said it didn't have any form or
[2:04:21] void it was in the world well where was
[2:04:23] it
[2:04:25] now we get Revelations of the seals and
[2:04:28] we step over on this side of it and we
[2:04:31] say it's in the mind of God
[2:04:35] he knew it from the beginning of the end
[2:04:38] and then when he moved upon it
[2:04:41] it started taking form when he moves
[2:04:45] upon the seed it starts to come to life
[2:04:49] so you say I pray for Revelation yes
[2:04:52] Revelation is The Enlightenment that you
[2:04:56] know the seeds for you now pray for the
[2:04:59] spirit
[2:05:00] to move upon your revelation
[2:05:04] amen and bring it to life
[2:05:06] well this is a great sobering thought
[2:05:09] there is a line you can cross
[2:05:15] now why are we talking about walls
[2:05:19] because we don't want to cross the line
[2:05:23] don't go outside the city
[2:05:27] I believe there was like I don't know I
[2:05:29] forget who it was the Bible character
[2:05:32] but he's in the Bible he'd done
[2:05:34] something wrong took somebody's Vineyard
[2:05:36] killed them and those things like that
[2:05:38] and he was safe
[2:05:41] as long as he stayed in the city
[2:05:45] and did David tell joab is that but he
[2:05:48] told him he said you know
[2:05:51] make sure this guy doesn't live all the
[2:05:53] days of his life
[2:05:55] I hope that gets you encouraged to go
[2:05:57] read that Bible story
[2:05:59] and I think a donkey or something got
[2:06:01] away and he got so greedy and possessive
[2:06:04] that he walked out from under the
[2:06:06] protection
[2:06:08] that God had provided for him and he
[2:06:11] crossed the line
[2:06:12] good
[2:06:15] and he lost his life
[2:06:17] you know there was a prophet
[2:06:19] that God told them to go prophesy
[2:06:23] and he said go prophesy don't stop
[2:06:25] return don't stop the talking
[2:06:28] and another Prophet came out
[2:06:32] appearing as an angel of Light
[2:06:36] and gave him a big sad pitch about you
[2:06:38] know I know you're hungry and tired and
[2:06:40] everything why don't you come rest with
[2:06:41] me and all those things and he said oh
[2:06:44] that sounds like a good idea you know
[2:06:46] that just must be the Lord
[2:06:49] no the Lord don't tell you the two two
[2:06:51] different things
[2:06:55] and usually God speaks first
[2:07:00] so he goes down and sits down and
[2:07:02] everything and so thankful brother we're
[2:07:04] in such wonderful Fellowship it's good
[2:07:06] he's just fellowshipping with this guy
[2:07:08] then the guy stands up and prophesies I
[2:07:10] told you not to go
[2:07:13] you're gonna be dead
[2:07:17] the guy's done
[2:07:20] what did he do
[2:07:22] he crossed the line
[2:07:26] we've got predestination down
[2:07:30] that we think predestination allows us
[2:07:33] to do whatever we want whenever we want
[2:07:35] to do it
[2:07:38] well you may not lose your
[2:07:39] predestination you just must lose your
[2:07:41] life
[2:07:43] be totally fruitless
[2:07:46] and be saved by fire
[2:07:51] how many wants to choose that option
[2:07:54] any takers
[2:07:56] you'll still be there
[2:07:59] you'll have a life with no service
[2:08:02] you'll have a life with no fruits
[2:08:06] you'll be consumed by fire and saved by
[2:08:09] fire
[2:08:09] but you'll still be there
[2:08:14] you talk about choosing the lesser of
[2:08:16] two evils
[2:08:18] I don't want to go that way
[2:08:20] so I want to take heed
[2:08:22] right this is for us
[2:08:27] we have it on the boat there there is a
[2:08:30] line you can cross
[2:08:31] you know that don't you
[2:08:35] now ministers both here and out on the
[2:08:39] telephone land where this broadcast is
[2:08:41] coming across the Nations do you realize
[2:08:45] that
[2:08:46] When You See It scripture
[2:08:50] and you won't do it
[2:08:53] God won't always
[2:08:55] heal oh you'll go on
[2:08:59] be blessed
[2:09:01] so every one of Israel they lived right
[2:09:05] on in the wilderness
[2:09:07] and raise children crops and blessed and
[2:09:11] everything but every one of them
[2:09:14] eternally separated from God
[2:09:17] Jesus said so oh yes
[2:09:21] God will bless you right on
[2:09:24] but you're
[2:09:26] you're gone
[2:09:28] certainly
[2:09:29] that's what the Bible says now that's
[2:09:32] what he says notice you can cross the
[2:09:36] separating line do you believe that
[2:09:40] Cain did
[2:09:46] that's a good thing to add in our
[2:09:48] balance
[2:09:49] prophet of God said we've taken Grace
[2:09:52] and turned it into disgrace
[2:09:57] we want to be careful
[2:10:00] you say well what happens if I cross the
[2:10:02] line be quick to repent cry Abba Father
[2:10:07] come back to him right away Lord I
[2:10:10] didn't mean to do it never never never
[2:10:13] make an excuse for sin
[2:10:17] if it's sin it's sin if you did it
[2:10:21] repent he's just and faithful to forgive
[2:10:25] you but when you try to butter it up and
[2:10:29] try to explain it and try to do it then
[2:10:32] you've broke down your wall
[2:10:36] and now that Spirit has free access
[2:10:39] to come back and forth the next time
[2:10:42] you'll come up with a better explanation
[2:10:44] and a better explanation and pretty soon
[2:10:47] you'll give yourself a reason and all of
[2:10:50] a sudden you know you get one of these
[2:10:52] remarks God don't care whether you drink
[2:10:55] or smoke he loves everybody
[2:10:59] people have
[2:11:00] Fallen away from this message
[2:11:03] which had blessed them gave them
[2:11:06] influence they've seen Miracles done
[2:11:08] through the message they had and they
[2:11:10] let one little seed in
[2:11:16] one little reason in
[2:11:19] and they crossed the line that separated
[2:11:22] them
[2:11:23] they tried to get in there and reason
[2:11:25] with them
[2:11:28] and he's smarter than you are
[2:11:32] right
[2:11:33] he's given us an answer
[2:11:36] he didn't say I had to understand it
[2:11:39] he said I had to believe it and I do I
[2:11:43] can't explain the cloud where it come
[2:11:44] from and everything I don't know all
[2:11:46] what you want me to know from science
[2:11:51] how are you gonna get a scientific
[2:11:54] answer when Satan is the author of
[2:11:58] Science and he's a liar
[2:12:02] and there's no truth in them
[2:12:07] all I know is what he said he said God
[2:12:10] left the sign in the cloud
[2:12:13] turn it it's the what I said in in
[2:12:16] Services is the time the white wig
[2:12:18] supreme authority
[2:12:22] amen it was where it was
[2:12:25] right it's a way the way he described it
[2:12:30] so I can just see the prophet on the
[2:12:32] phone hello NASA
[2:12:35] I need a rocket shot up out of
[2:12:37] California February
[2:12:40] you'll do that for me right
[2:12:44] that's more ignorant
[2:12:46] did anything
[2:12:51] that they don't have anything in them to
[2:12:52] believe with
[2:12:54] they cross the line right
[2:12:57] and they go on being blessed
[2:13:02] but they're goners
[2:13:05] and I believe God says these things
[2:13:07] because Peter said be sober and be
[2:13:10] diligent
[2:13:12] right because he's provided for us an
[2:13:14] entrance into the kingdom of God
[2:13:18] it's a can we just read he said
[2:13:23] he says
[2:13:24] let us just turn over here a minute in
[2:13:27] Hebrews 10 6. let us see if we if that
[2:13:31] is right quick the book of Hebrews the
[2:13:34] 10th chapter I believe the 26th verse I
[2:13:36] got it wrote out here just a minute if
[2:13:39] you'll bear with me let's just read it a
[2:13:42] minute all right here we are for if we
[2:13:46] will for at least
[2:13:48] for if we sin willfully
[2:13:52] that we've received the knowledge of the
[2:13:55] truth after that we've received the
[2:13:58] knowledge of the truth there remaineth
[2:14:01] no more sacrifice for sin
[2:14:05] but certain fearful looking for the
[2:14:09] judgment and the fiery ignic nation
[2:14:12] which should Devour the adversary
[2:14:17] don't give room for him
[2:14:21] build a wall keep them out
[2:14:25] no matter how smart he is
[2:14:28] you know just be dumb enough to believe
[2:14:31] God's word
[2:14:33] amen God didn't come to the rich of this
[2:14:36] world he came to the rich in faith
[2:14:40] that's thus saith God's holy word
[2:14:44] if we
[2:14:46] disbelieve willfully
[2:14:49] after we've seen it and heard it then
[2:14:53] we've crawled Weaver
[2:14:55] across the line
[2:14:58] there will never be no more forgiveness
[2:15:01] for it you have crossed the line oh you
[2:15:05] say God still blessed me oh yeah
[2:15:08] remember Israel the borderlines when God
[2:15:12] gave them a promise over in the Holy
[2:15:15] Land in the land it was good of milk and
[2:15:18] honey
[2:15:19] and when Moses set out Caleb and Joshua
[2:15:22] and the spies to go over and spy out the
[2:15:25] land and brought back the Vindicated
[2:15:27] evidence
[2:15:29] the Ten of them said we can't do it
[2:15:32] we're unable
[2:15:34] look at
[2:15:35] the difficulty there
[2:15:37] will be fanatics
[2:15:40] we've got these little bitty things to
[2:15:43] fight with
[2:15:44] look what they got
[2:15:46] we can't do it we're not able to do it
[2:15:54] boy
[2:15:55] aren't we fighting the Giants in the
[2:15:58] land
[2:16:00] we can't be that Christian can't have
[2:16:03] that Faith to lay our hands on our sin
[2:16:05] we can't cast out those devils look at
[2:16:08] how big those devils are
[2:16:11] crack and alcoholism and sure demons and
[2:16:16] Cancers and all kinds of stuff he's just
[2:16:20] got the land possessed and what do we
[2:16:23] got
[2:16:24] we're nobody
[2:16:28] we got two or three four four hundred
[2:16:30] people 500 people maybe we got a mega
[2:16:34] church with a thousand people that's
[2:16:36] nothing
[2:16:40] there's 20 million Catholics in the
[2:16:42] United States
[2:16:47] numbers
[2:16:49] where's our power
[2:16:51] In The Word of Promise
[2:16:54] why did Joshua and Caleb say look at
[2:16:57] their response
[2:16:58] in Joshua and Caleb said we are more
[2:17:01] than able to do it God made the promise
[2:17:06] Glory
[2:17:09] so what are we looking for
[2:17:12] we're looking for the transforming
[2:17:14] quickening power of the spirit right
[2:17:17] that brings that promise to life in us
[2:17:20] that we will act upon it and call those
[2:17:24] things which are not as if they are
[2:17:30] now we're fanatics
[2:17:34] bye
[2:17:35] amen now we start testifying to things
[2:17:38] that haven't happened yet yes amen
[2:17:42] praise God my family saved
[2:17:46] praise God for brother such and such
[2:17:49] praise God for this praise God for that
[2:17:52] people say I don't see none of it that's
[2:17:54] okay
[2:17:57] what did he say that nurse he said
[2:17:59] brother Branham
[2:18:01] here look at the chart yeah
[2:18:06] there's been nobody that's only had
[2:18:09] 13 pulses per minute in their heart or
[2:18:12] whatever it was yeah that Old Saint got
[2:18:15] up
[2:18:16] and walked over there he didn't yell at
[2:18:19] that nurse he put his arm around her
[2:18:21] because he wanted her to have what he
[2:18:24] had
[2:18:25] he says
[2:18:27] sister
[2:18:28] I understand you you're looking at the
[2:18:31] chart all right we're looking at a
[2:18:34] promise
[2:18:37] and we believe God is able to perform
[2:18:41] that which he promised amen
[2:18:45] that is faith
[2:18:48] and faith is a gift of God it's the
[2:18:51] quickening power that he gives you to
[2:18:55] bring the word of God alive in your life
[2:18:58] it's in you in seed form
[2:19:01] the deformer has kept the quickening
[2:19:04] power from getting to it
[2:19:07] Daniel had to pray and pray and pray
[2:19:11] because Satan withstood the angel
[2:19:15] but who prevailed
[2:19:18] when there was nobody worthy to open the
[2:19:21] book who prevailed
[2:19:26] amen
[2:19:27] when we looked like we're a mess
[2:19:30] who's going to prevail
[2:19:32] is he going to have a bride yes is she
[2:19:35] going to be without spot or wrinkle yes
[2:19:38] am I a part of it yes do you say well
[2:19:42] you have a couple wrinkles praise God's
[2:19:44] got an iron
[2:19:52] and and we are more than able to do it
[2:19:55] God made the promise and remember they
[2:19:58] turned back that was that Katie sparnia
[2:20:00] they turned back and became wanders in
[2:20:04] the wilderness and every one of them
[2:20:06] died it was lost
[2:20:08] eternally Jesus said so don't cross that
[2:20:13] separating line see you know to do good
[2:20:17] and don't
[2:20:19] do it not to you
[2:20:22] it's sin
[2:20:26] that's why
[2:20:29] we are what we are
[2:20:31] that's why we build the line walls
[2:20:34] that's why we're called out that's why
[2:20:37] we're separated sisters that's why you
[2:20:40] don't cut your hair you dress wholly you
[2:20:43] live clean brothers that's why you don't
[2:20:46] partake of the world you look after the
[2:20:49] sisters you look after your children we
[2:20:52] take our post to duty we stand in our
[2:20:54] Watchtower and and we let our light
[2:20:57] shine
[2:20:58] we have a gate that's open the Sheep
[2:21:02] gate
[2:21:03] you know can you go back down you know
[2:21:05] the next gate after the Sheep gate
[2:21:08] the fish gate
[2:21:11] that's where you go fishing for Souls
[2:21:15] you have a way for them to come in
[2:21:17] and then you have a gate you fish for
[2:21:19] them
[2:21:20] you know you know what I think the next
[2:21:22] gate is
[2:21:23] I think it's the dung gate
[2:21:26] that's where you clean all the stuff out
[2:21:28] of your life and we could just go
[2:21:30] through all seven of the gates a horse
[2:21:33] gate
[2:21:35] you know what I mean
[2:21:37] power of God just different types and
[2:21:40] rubber bands that horse means power now
[2:21:42] you're all wanting me to go through the
[2:21:44] gates
[2:21:47] you know I mean you got Bibles
[2:21:51] yeah you know maybe we'll go through one
[2:21:53] or two of the gates and
[2:21:54] and uh everything you know I believe
[2:21:57] there's a gate that's called the
[2:21:59] Damascus gate
[2:22:01] and that may not be in in uh nehemiah's
[2:22:05] time but when I read about the Damascus
[2:22:07] gate what do you think I thought about
[2:22:10] Paul being on this road to Damascus
[2:22:12] right and that's the gate that brought
[2:22:15] the gospel to the Gentile
[2:22:19] now that's just me reading the Bible
[2:22:22] you understand I don't have a prophetic
[2:22:24] Ministry and I don't know I'm just
[2:22:27] saying that there's a lot of inspiration
[2:22:30] in the scriptures so Lord bless you we
[2:22:33] love you let's have a good week uh Tommy
[2:22:36] has spoke the rain away so I'm going to
[2:22:39] join my faith with his you know what I
[2:22:41] mean and and I just know whatever's
[2:22:45] ahead of us he's in control
[2:22:49] but in a way if our if our trusses get
[2:22:52] dropped off this Tuesday
[2:22:54] uh we're gonna have to nail them all
[2:22:56] they're going to drop them off
[2:22:58] singly
[2:23:00] 100 of them
[2:23:02] and then we've got to put them together
[2:23:05] so if there's anybody that can swing a
[2:23:07] hammer
[2:23:09] you know
[2:23:10] if you if you have the hammer I've got
[2:23:15] the nail
[2:23:19] or you bring the nail and I'll give you
[2:23:21] the hammer I don't care
[2:23:22] but anyway we hope they're dropped off
[2:23:25] if you can come tomorrow afternoon
[2:23:27] tomorrow evening and help us spread it's
[2:23:30] a Tuesday evening and if it's raining
[2:23:33] just put on a rain suit
[2:23:35] and uh we'll work forward
[2:23:40] and if we do have service next Wednesday
[2:23:43] night everybody will have to park in the
[2:23:46] far parking lot because the first two
[2:23:49] these first two parking lots around the
[2:23:51] building are going to be shut down
[2:23:53] so just get used to going to the second
[2:23:56] entrance going in and parking back there
[2:24:00] anyway you think we can do it
[2:24:04] amen you think we can become in the
[2:24:06] statue
[2:24:09] a lot of things fighting against us a
[2:24:12] lot of big alley-oops out there
[2:24:15] but what is he
[2:24:18] he's a bluff
[2:24:19] we are more than conquerors in Christ
[2:24:22] Jesus we can all do all things through
[2:24:26] Christ Jesus that's within us if the
[2:24:29] same spirit that was in Christ dwell in
[2:24:32] you it'll Quicken your Immortal bodies
[2:24:35] God
[2:24:38] send that transforming power I'm looking
[2:24:41] for the transforming power I'm looking
[2:24:44] for the quickening life that brings that
[2:24:47] seed that's in me you say brother
[2:24:49] McGeary if you reached maturity
[2:24:51] potentially
[2:24:55] but there's a power yes because there's
[2:24:58] a promise that he that started the work
[2:25:01] in me would finish it till the end and
[2:25:05] that's my story and I'm sticking with it
[2:25:08] God bless you
[2:25:10] [Applause]
[2:25:18] Lord let's all stand
[2:25:20] I like that
[2:25:24] there's a promise if there's a promise
[2:25:26] then there's power
[2:25:28] the power of transformation
[2:25:32] now let's see that Psalms 34 I sought
[2:25:35] the Lord
[2:25:36] can we do that
[2:25:42] or a few more
[2:25:43] comfortable praise the Lord I enjoyed
[2:25:45] the word today
[2:25:47] isn't that wonderful just to have the
[2:25:48] word broke to you we can feed on that
[2:25:52] and it's not just for today you can feed
[2:25:53] on that tomorrow
[2:25:55] you can open up your Bible and keep
[2:25:57] feasting and
[2:25:59] open up the message of the hour and keep
[2:26:01] listening in the power to transform

[2:31:45] brother Caleb if you can come and
[2:31:46] dismiss us a prayer
[2:31:49] you're so thankful for the word that
[2:31:51] we've heard today
[2:31:55] what what a privilege it is to have
[2:31:58] one on the Watchtower
[2:32:00] saying don't cross the separating line
[2:32:02] [Music]
[2:32:04] think of that young lady brother Branham
[2:32:07] was having a Revival in a Baptist Church
[2:32:08] and the Holy Spirit said go talk to that
[2:32:11] young woman
[2:32:13] hear the prophet to the age God directed
[2:32:16] The Prophet back said young lady God's
[2:32:18] calling you and she said if I wanted
[2:32:19] somebody to talk to me
[2:32:21] he walked away
[2:32:23] the Lord said go back and call her again
[2:32:25] and he went back and she refused third
[2:32:28] time outside the church she said if I
[2:32:30] wanted somebody to talk to me I'd have
[2:32:31] somebody more sense
[2:32:33] you know God's calling to you tonight
[2:32:37] let's don't cross the separated in line
[2:32:38] let's don't think this is just by chance
[2:32:41] our pastor going to the storehouse
[2:32:44] and come and say don't cross the
[2:32:46] separating line
[2:32:47] because some of us are on the fence some
[2:32:50] of us are thinking about things out
[2:32:51] there but I say oh God I want to take
[2:32:53] heed to the message of the hour
[2:32:55] because it was just three or four years
[2:32:57] the prophet saw that young girl she said
[2:32:59] oh I I could see my mama's soul fry in
[2:33:03] hell and it wouldn't bother me a bit
[2:33:04] because what happened
[2:33:05] she didn't heed the message of the hour
[2:33:08] I say oh God thank you for your call
[2:33:10] tonight Lord may I be sensitive may I
[2:33:13] not leave here Lord if there's something
[2:33:15] I need to make right
[2:33:17] let me make it right Lord God bless you
