section who has spoken to us soundness it is that we allow you into access we pray oh lord thank you for bringing us back we're committing the continuation of the meeting this evening to your care lord as we are preparing to dine at your table we ask that you will come among us and encourage us and speak to us forgive us all our trespasses and prepare us lord if there be any condemnation in our hearts we take it away and that we approach the communion with faith bless our pastor bless the officers of the church and bless the entire church father we thank you in jesus name we pray amen why were the men standing turn our bibles to corinthians first corinthians chapter 11. i want to read from the 23rd verse for i received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take it this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he accept saying this is this cup is the new testament in my blood this he do as of as ye drink it in remembrance of me may the lord has ready to love the word you may be seated and we thank the lord this evening for bringing us back again we thank him for all that he's doing our life preparing us for his coming to come and take us back home tonight as we are all informed that we're going to take communion i hope we are all prepared for the convenience service i believe we know what communion is and [Music] we are ready to be part of it tonight yeah we thank the lord for the scripture red this is paul writing to the corinthians trying to tell them about what communion is and the conditions by which they take it i believe that communion is an ordinance of the lord two thousand years ago we're forbidden to do it we're bidding to do it and as we do it we remember the lord we know communion is for overcomings because if we go back the scripture we found out that when abraham when he went and conquered the kings slaughtered them and he was coming back victoriously he met mercy zedek and then the scripture said he had a communion with him he strengthened him he fortified him gave him bread and wine and abram gave entities to him so communion is for overcomers those that overcome the enemy those that overcome all the forces that are fighting their christian life communion is for them and paul warned the believers in his days about taking communion without descending the lost body taking communion wasn't seen taking communion was right taking communion they did what the lord expected of them but their problem in taking the communion was that they did not descend the lost body and the lord's body is the believers if we are talking about discernment or descending the lord's body it means doing what the church does not believe if you descend the lord's body you listen the believers you know what we stand for you know what we are believing you flee from it as believers but if you do not descend the lord's body you go doing it so paul won them they did the right thing but they did it without descending the lost body discernment is very important in a believer's life our the same discernment determined where we are going a wrong discernment of the word of god of the ordinances of god will lead you to sin but the right discernment everything a man does as a christian he ought to measure it by the word of god he has to measure it by the message of the arrow he has to measure it by what the church stands for if you don't do it that way then you don't descend the lord's body tonight we are going to take communion communion is an institution of the lord and as i said abraham when he met mercedes he had a communion with him and when the israelites were to leave the land of bodies when god was going to deliver them the scripture made us to know that they were instructed to kill a lamb and when they kill the lamb they should apply the blood at the doctors and they should eat the lung holes they should eat it before the following morning we found out that god instructed them that death engine was to pass by and every house that does not have blood on it the the first born in that house will have to die so they have to make sure that they follow this instruction if you are the firstborn in that house you have to make sure that the blood is applied you have to question your father whether he has done according to what god required of him and we found out that when jesus christ came here before he left he had a communion with his disciples and he even said he is not going to take it with them again on this earth until he take it with them at the other side what is communion we are talking about communion communion is to communicate is to talk is to speak and we have the privilege to have communion tonight it is time to speak with the lord to tell him our heart desire to tell him our needs to tell him the challenges that we are facing in our life to have fellowship with him we find out that in the world when businessmen want to discuss business they go to fellowship by eating together by drinking tea together and during that time they share their visions they share their business plans with one another but tonight it's not business it is spiritual business it's not physical business but it's spiritual business we have the privilege to come before the lord and when we come to eat it we need to tell the lord our challenges the challenges that we are facing in our christian life the challenge that we are facing in our homes the challenging that we are facing in our daily life we need to tell him amen communion whosoever will want to take communion must understand that communion does not save communion does not save as the denominations may teach communion strengthens us fortifies us stimulates us to live a right to us and a clean life according to scripture when israel was instructed to apply the blood at the doorpost with his soup they have to stay indoor they should not go outside even though they apply the blood and they are inside they send one of their foot outside when the death engine comes he'll cut it because it's not protected it's not under the blood when we take communion we need to stay in the world we need to leave by the word we don't take communion and go outside and live anyhow and mingle with the world if we do this we bring reproach upon the world we bring reproach upon christ if we take communion we need to stay inside and coming in is not for everybody when we come to take communion we must make sure that first we are washed by the waters of the world separated by the waters of from our sins amen we must repent from our sins we must repent from our unbelief we must repent for anything that the church does not believe that israel paul inserted the corinthians he said when you come to take it you must first examine yourself self-examination you didn't ask somebody to examine you maybe somebody is examining you there are things you can hide from him you can hide from her but if you are to examine yourself i don't think there's anything you can hide from yourself if you can deceive yourself then you are a miserable fellow amen you need to be frank with yourself so a person everybody must examine him or herself self-examination he said this is what the corinthians did they did not examine themselves they did not descend their lost body so when they took communion some die prematurely when we say they die prematurely it means the number of years that they need to live on earth they could not leave it they died prematurely because they did not descend their lost body but i believe tonight that it is not going to be the physical one but it is going to be the spiritual one some took it and they became sick some took it and they became weak but communion is for divine healing anybody that is sick in a way when you come to take communion that sickness must go because communion is for divine healing i remember at home there was a brother who was suffering from oscar also he's been to many hospitals he was not healed there was a day we held a communion service after taking the communion the following day it vanished there was a brother who was having a west pain he went to the farm to go uproot cassava and then he has this location in the west he's been to different hospitals the chinese hospitals he was not healed one day when we took communion the following day the sickness vanish the pain vanish breathiness is a lot anytime there is communion we need to take advantage of it by taking it rightly that is why we need to take it by ourselves when you come to take it across the scripture when you take it unworthily you eat and you drink damnation for yourself you think condemnation but i don't think a normal person will see anything which may cost his life and then he takes it and drinks it he takes it and eat it i don't believe it that fellow there's something wrong with him therefore tonight when coming to take the communion we need to take it by faith we need to take it having it repented from our sins our own beliefs our backsliding we need to take it by faith i normally type communion to something we do in africa in africa when a woman the husband dies to make sure that he doesn't teach cheat on the man there's a porridge they prepare and give to the woman to drink when she drinks it if she had cheated on the husband the bella would swallow if she has not cheated she'll drink it and she'll be okay i know my tapping to communion like paul said if you eat it unworthily knowing very well that there's something in your heart knowing very well there's something you need to put right knowing very well that there's something between you and your brother you and your sister and you don't put it right you are trading on a dangerous ground that's a poor one that we have to carry ye for one another carry ye for one another let us reconcile with one another let us forgive one another let us make peace with one another before we come take it then of course we will be blessed communion is not for case it's for a blessing once a man takes it rightly he need to be blessed she need to be blessed but if you don't take it rightly that's where the problem lies you have to take it by dedicating yourself you have to take it by separating yourself from every unbelief you have to take it with faith you have to take it proven to the church that you are a christian there are many people when we talk about communion they postpone it so let this month's communion go i am not ready what are you waiting for what are you not ready for i'll do it next month maybe next month he said another meant again and he continued postponing continue postponing it and finally he will condemn himself there is no fit to take communion but greatness a lot we have to do it to remember the lord we have to do it to prove that we are christians we have to do it to prove that we believe the total word we have to do it to show that we are part of the church communion is what we are talking about tonight paul said as orphaned as he drink it as often as he eat it he do remember me amen we remember what the lord has done for us he saved us he died for our sins and we need to remember it it becomes fresh in our memory it's not fresh in our heart it becomes fresh in our conscience that prevents us from going but to do the very things that he died for if we go back to those things we'll crucify him the second time that is why we need to remember him we are going to remember him tonight and i believe that we are all ready for this ordinance it's an undines it's a commandment of the lord it is not an option whether i like it i take it whether i like it i don't take it no when our lord was going he left us three commandments baptism in jesus name communion and foot washing and this communion these ordinances is an obligation paul said if you claim you are spiritual you should note all that i'm saying are the commandment of the lord and when we say something is commandment it's not an option it's something you have to do it therefore when communion table are set like we are saying today whatever our hindrances are whatever our problems are we must be ready to sacrifice them and to be part of the communion amen and amen for communion that's good things to us communion is a must amen you see there are three things that we must that we must three things that we must do as symbols the last supper feet washing and baptism amen three things you cannot do one and leave the rest you have to do all the three in order to be complete and we found out here that paul wants us that we must not do it without descending the lord's body amen we should not do it without discernment we should not do it without knowing what we are doing we should not do it without believing what we are doing we have to do it by faith believing it is the commandments of god and once we do it it will do a whole lot of things in our life it will change our life it will heal us it will strengthen us all that we are not able to do we will start doing them because we've been to the presence of the lord communion in the life of a believer proof he's a winner proof he's victorious prove he has defeated the enemy and the plans of the enemy but when we run from each we are giving more room to the devil communion is more or less like a sieve that the lord has permitted in the church it is used to sieve the wrong things in the church there are people who have kept things in in their heart for years they will never put it right but when there's a communion that is when they put it right so if there's no communion we don't put this right if there's communion before we put this right that's why i say communion is deceived the scriptures say we should do it as often as we can do it and the more we do it very often the more we close every door to the devil from infiltrating into the church the more we close every door from the devil coming in and preventing the church from living a life that is not worthy of the gospel communion is very important amen and we need to do it by reference we need to reference it we need to do it with reverence we need to do it knowing what we are doing more or less in between life and death it's a challenge to every believer in time of communion many may use different excuses but i will prefer to sacrifice everything to come to a communion rather than using minor excuses knowing very well that a man is not ready he'll use a minor excuse no sir a child of god must attach important to communion communion is a feast with the lord and when it's time to feast with the lord we need to be happy we need to rejoice i remember at home if it take time that we don't take communion bernie come to me pastor it seems this long time we took communion what is wrong we want to take communion for we know what it does to us it is true that a believer taking communion it does a whole lot of things in his life which you cannot even imagine because you take the lost body into yourself not a literal body it's a symbol it's something that represents the lord's body but you take it with faith we take it with understanding you take it with the belief and that's where it works tonight we are going to take communion i believe we are prepared how many of us are prepared tonight to take the communion how many are happy tonight that we are going to die at the lost table how many of us are happy tonight because we have won victory over the enemy i will not take you so far this is just an exhortation gives us an advice to prepare ourselves for tonight's communion if there's something between you and your sister it will be advisable to call him out or to call her out and put it right put it right wait on one another carry ye for one another and get the right atmosphere the right anointing come to take it now the blessing that goes with it becomes your part we are going to pray tonight let us turn to our feet i love him [Music] love me and [Music] [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] on once again i love him while we are singing this song [Music] i want us to think on our way [Music] i want us to examine ourselves as paul has instructed i want us to send the lost body [Music] we are going to pray pray for your brother or your sister that is at your side pray for the ministers why the ministers also pray for the church asking the lord to forgive us maybe there's something in our life the holy spirit has impeached the sin and to us which will not make us to be qualified for communion this night we are going to pray and ask for forgiveness we are going to pray and ask the lord to cleanse us to have mercy upon us as individuals let us pray tonight prayer pray my brother pray my sister everybody must pray committing him or herself to the hands of the lord praying for forgiveness pray for your brother pray for your sister pray for the ministers pray for the deacons that the law will sanctify us tonight and forgive us all our shortcomings he is rich in mercy and prepare us whether we do not take this communion and let it be a judgment a condemnation we should not take it and deceit if there's any sickness in our life after taking this communion it should be the end of that sickness that demon that is tormenting us must flee in jesus name so that will be made whole pressure heavenly father we thank you this evening lord you're left with this commandment and we have guided tonight to do these commandments to obey this commandment to show that we are christians as paul commanded the corinthians that they must not do it without self-examination lord we have bowed our heads down tonight examining ourselves we pray that the holy spirit which is that the center of the thoughts and the intents of the heart should speak to our hearts tonight and if there's something we need to put right if there's something we need to repent of if there's a way we need to reconcile with one another give us the courage the and the courage the anointing is there something we need to forgive one another help us to be able to forgive one another so that we can enjoy the full benefit of this communion tonight in the name of our lord jesus christ we condemn every power of the enemy we pray o lord sanctify your people bringing them to your throne of grace help each and every one of us lord help me help our pastor have the offices of the church help the sisters have the brothers lord the youth so that will be qualified to take this communion and to dine at your table father we thank you in the name of our lord jesus christ we pray and as with thanksgiving thank you for having done it wild we still have our heads bowed down singing i love you i love you i'll turn the meeting to our pastor [Music] and work is my salvation [Music] amen as our brother so beautifully spoke to us communion is a wonderful opportunity if it's approached the right way if you know you have a weakness in your life or a sin that so easily beset you and you know it's wrong and you've repented of it you can approach the table in the right spirit an atmosphere for that deliverance if you have sickness in your body and and you know that you have faith in your heart this gives you a place in my vocabulary i'd call it a place of contact something that god's provided for you as our brother said that you can get your healing you can stand for somebody else if you have a loved one and and you'd really like to see god do something in their life this is a chance to approach this table with communion service with faith and have done for you exceedingly and abundantly above that which you can even think so okay see it's so it's a wonderful opportunity that god's provided for us to meet him and and show our heart and and i know a lot of us we we war against the flesh because the flesh wars against the spirit and we want to overcome the flesh and that's what communion does it gives us an opportunity to approach god and the right spirit and say lord i need overcoming power i'm sorry for the things i've done they're in the sea of forgetful but now i want to receive from you what i need to be victorious amen let's turn in our bibles since our brother read the scriptures in corinthians let us turn to matthew the 26th chapter and and we'll just take the story here starting in the 19th verse of the 26th chapter in the 19th chapter verse of the 26th chapter of matthew matthew 26 and 19 reads as follows and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover and now when he was come he sat down with the twelve and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me and they were exceedingly sorrowful and begin every one of them to say unto him lord is it i and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i and he said unto him thou has said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day which i drink it new with you in my father's house that's the communion service i'm looking forward to amen amen if the brothers would go prepare for the communion you may be seated just play it [Music] [Music] hey man let's all join together as we pray for this bread which represents his body and this wine then represents his blood maybe in your heart you can vision calvary and what it must look like our savior hanging there hanging there for the remission of your sins hanging there dying and bleeding because he loved you and he was paying a price that you and i deserve to pay but he paid the price for us that the charge of our sins and the punishment and the chastisement of our sins would not be laid upon us but he took that chastisement upon him and by those stripes we are healed and by those stripes we are delivered and he's giving us this opportunity in this service he provided this ordinance for us to be able to come and receive from him which he purchased at calgary if you need something from the lord tonight deliverance from a habit your spirit's weary and your heart is broken come touch the hem of his garment that virtue may flow from him to you and you'd be strengthened you have someone on your heart tonight a loved one that needs deliverance a loved one that needs healing bring that request to this opportunity that the lord's provided this is a meeting place he put in the life of christians that he said i will meet you here if you come and you approach me in the right spirit and you ask of me in no wise will i turn you away or let your faith rise up heavenly father we ask you to bless this bread father it brings us in remembrance of you father bring us in remembrance of your suffering but father it also brings us in the remembrance of your resurrection it reminds us that you're the bread of life which came down from heavens the word of god that can lead us and guide us and feed our souls we ask you to bless it to us this evening heavenly father this wine which represents the shed blood the life that you poured out on our behalf to wash as white as snow to make us whole again we remember this father and the communion of your spirit that you said i'll not lead you nor forsake you but i'll be with you even in you till the end father we know that this wine represents that promise and we take it with reverence this evening glory honoring you and thanking you for the love that you had for us that you would endure such suffering for one as i oh lord let me be able from this communion take the strength to express an undying love for you and a life worthy the gospel we ask it this evening in jesus precious name we pray amen
