[35:02] heart Lord I'm not playing Church
[35:04] tonight if there's ever a time that
[35:07] we're not playing churches now all we
[35:09] should be so sincere and sold out to him
[35:12] I'm not taking these times lightly but
[35:14] know that God is accomplishing something
[35:16] in each one of our lives amen praise the
[35:19] Lord let's just stand and go before him
[35:23] in prayer precious Heavenly Father how
[35:29] we love you Lord how we thank you we
[35:33] thank you that you're mindful of our
[35:35] needs Lord Lord and before we ever had
[35:40] the need you had already provided for us
[35:43] that's how great you are
[35:46] Lord and we just want to tell you that
[35:48] we love you now and as we would come to
[35:50] this portion of the service Lord we we
[35:54] need more grace than we've ever needed
[35:56] before in these very closing times of
[35:59] history Lord we've preached it we've
[36:02] said it we believe it Lord we believe it
[36:05] could be any day now that the change of
[36:08] our bodies would just break Lord may we
[36:12] not be slothful or may I not be the one
[36:16] that's holding the show up Lord may we
[36:19] just be so died out and surrender to
[36:21] your word nor that it would just
[36:22] manifest in its fullness and power that
[36:25] you've spoken it to do we love you Lord
[36:27] we commit ourselves to you we just ask
[36:30] that by your divine grace immersing your
[36:32] Holy Spirit you come break the bread of
[36:33] life as only you can we ask in your name
[36:35] now the Lord Jesus Christ the man praise
[36:38] Lord amen if you could turning their
[36:42] Bibles would be reading out of Matthew
[36:44] chapter 12 verse 32 Matthew chapter 12
[36:51] verse 32 amen I'm thankful the word says
[36:57] where two or three are gathered in my
[36:59] name there I will be a man and and I
[37:03] know it can certainly be an extra
[37:06] challenge to focus maybe to stay in tune
[37:10] when you're you're in the comforts of
[37:13] your home and it seems like there's not
[37:15] as much restriction you're able to move
[37:17] about and and be able to get a coke if
[37:20] you're thirsty and you're able to lounge
[37:24] but I would want to have a seriousness
[37:26] and a sobriety as we approach the Word
[37:29] of God and to have the same reverence
[37:32] and respect for the time that we have
[37:35] gathered because this is a time that our
[37:37] pastor has continued to provide for his
[37:40] flock under the leadership of the Holy
[37:42] Ghost and so we don't want to take it
[37:45] lightly we want to take full advantage
[37:47] because it can it's it's in times like
[37:49] this that God is perfecting the bride
[37:52] amen we're reading out of Matthew
[37:54] chapter 12 verse 32 through 37
[37:59] says and whosoever speaketh a word
[38:01] against the Son of Man they shall be
[38:05] forgiven him but whosoever speaketh
[38:08] against the Holy Ghost it shall not be
[38:12] forgiven him neither in this world
[38:14] neither in the world to come either make
[38:19] the tree good and His fruit good or else
[38:22] make or else make the tree corrupt and
[38:24] his fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[38:28] by his fruit old generation of vipers
[38:31] how can ye being evil speak good things
[38:35] for out of the abundance of the heart
[38:39] the mouth speaketh a good man out of the
[38:43] good treasure of the heart bringeth
[38:45] forth good things and the evil man out
[38:48] of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil
[38:51] things but I say unto you that every
[38:54] idle word that men shall speak they
[38:57] shall give account therefore thereof in
[39:02] the day of judgment for by thy words
[39:05] thou shalt be justified and by thy words
[39:09] thou shalt be condemned Lord we just ask
[39:15] a special blessing upon the reading of
[39:17] your word and your name Jesus Christ we
[39:19] pray amen
[39:20] those of you that are gathered can be
[39:22] seated I want to read a quote out of the
[39:27] unveiling of God so the Bible is no
[39:35] private interpretation
[39:38] it must be word by word the way it's
[39:42] written we must believe that and not
[39:46] only believe it but live it and so as as
[39:49] I I move towards this thought of saying
[39:53] the right thing and and speaking the
[39:57] right words it's not just in the saying
[39:59] of it but it's in the saying of it that
[40:01] we might live it and bring it into
[40:03] manifestation so it's not only believe
[40:05] it but live it if we don't live it then
[40:08] we don't believe it we just say we do
[40:12] like basing back to what I said those
[40:14] disciples could not explain it but they
[40:16] believed it anyhow and they made their
[40:19] confession and lived it when all the
[40:22] rest of them walked away from it they
[40:24] stayed with it they believed it well if
[40:28] we were ever living in a time where so
[40:30] many are walking away but yet there's a
[40:33] there's a little bride maybe she's going
[40:36] to be hunted and persecuted but there's
[40:38] a little bride or are you in that number
[40:40] tonight that's going to stay with it nor
[40:42] there's many things I don't understand
[40:44] Lord but I believe it I confess it I
[40:47] might not understand it I might
[40:49] understand how all of its going to be
[40:51] manifested Lord but I believe it that's
[40:54] the way we do that's the way you got to
[40:57] do it no matter what anybody else does
[41:00] we believe it and then we act upon it if
[41:04] you don't do it then you don't believe
[41:06] it notice now as he came he had to come
[41:10] as son of man because the holy scripture
[41:13] said that he would God would raise up a
[41:16] prophet to them so he so he could not
[41:18] come calling himself the son of God
[41:20] because it wasn't that dispensation he
[41:24] was the son of man prophesy to fulfill
[41:27] and revealing to them all the things
[41:30] that had been done and tight what he was
[41:33] then he was on earth as son of man look
[41:38] at the Sarah Phoenician woman run to him
[41:41] and she said thou son of David have
[41:42] mercy on me he never has much raised his
[41:45] head she had no claims on him as son of
[41:47] David she was a Gentile no more than my
[41:50] daughter has claims on me as husband and
[41:52] my wife as daughter yet she is my
[41:54] daughter and my wife and she's my
[41:56] daughter in the gospel but earthly she
[42:01] has no right to call me father seat now
[42:03] notice this Gentile woman had no claims
[42:05] on him as son of David but blind
[42:08] Bartimaeus did see he was a Jew now he
[42:11] came as son of men you know you have you
[42:16] have to know these words and these
[42:19] things the Prophet is pointing out you
[42:22] have to know these were
[42:24] and these things now look what he says
[42:26] here he says look at Hattie right that
[42:28] time when the third pool you remember of
[42:32] all the everything the woman said the
[42:35] right thing you've got to say that right
[42:39] word the right thing to God and maybe as
[42:44] what would maybe appear to be maybe an
[42:46] odd subject or title I want to title
[42:49] this message that's nothing but the
[42:51] truth because when that portion there
[42:54] that brother branham is referring to
[42:56] when brother Branham is giving testimony
[42:58] of the third pool that came into action
[43:00] and he was there testifying and say oh
[43:02] no that not that he said you have need
[43:05] of squirrels and I spoke in there come
[43:07] that squirrel oh right into existence as
[43:09] I spoke it something in hat ear I just
[43:12] welled up and said that's nothing but
[43:14] the truth what was she giving you
[43:16] witness to what shoe she was confessing
[43:18] to all something inside of her I say
[43:21] that that was a predestinated seed that
[43:24] was identifying with the word being made
[43:27] flesh and all he might have been a
[43:29] uncontrollable utterance she might not
[43:31] even been know what she was saying but
[43:33] when she heard that go for season oh
[43:35] that's nothing but the truth and oh my
[43:38] watch what happened it brought Jesus on
[43:41] the scene and as we just approach this
[43:49] subject that's nothing but the truth I
[43:51] pray that that would be our hearts cry
[43:53] towards the word I pray that that would
[43:57] be our expectation that we would just we
[44:01] as the word would go forth and as we
[44:03] feed upon the message that something is
[44:05] welling up inside of you word upon word
[44:09] that's saying that's nothing but the
[44:10] truth Oh church if we could come to the
[44:14] services and and this time that we're
[44:16] living in if you can come on and strain
[44:18] and something in your heart would be
[44:21] longing and desiring and looking for
[44:24] something to come forth to say oh I'm
[44:27] looking for that word to strike my soul
[44:29] that I can say oh that's nothing but the
[44:32] truth or I believe we want to have a
[44:35] type of longing type of cry not not not
[44:38] looking to traditions of man not looking
[44:41] to things to appease the flesh I'm not
[44:44] saying that's nothing but the truth to
[44:45] man's ideas and and all the way that we
[44:48] would like they know but something
[44:50] deeper than that something that's a
[44:52] revelation that struck Peter on that day
[44:55] when he said who do you say I the Son of
[44:57] Man in oh my he he they asked the
[45:01] question he asked the question first
[45:02] year ago some say this some say that but
[45:06] he narrowed it down who do you say that
[45:09] I am and I believe that's what the word
[45:11] is doing us ain't going for it it's
[45:12] identifying that gene part of God that's
[45:15] inside of you that says oh don't alert
[45:18] the Christ that the Son of the Living
[45:20] God thou art the truth oh and you can't
[45:23] deny because you're part of it it's who
[45:25] you are
[45:26] it's your identification I was going to
[45:31] try to calm down
[45:35] try to slow down calm down oh but this
[45:38] is such an exciting word that we have as
[45:43] we just look into this and continue on
[45:47] this where this word is bringing forth
[45:49] the attribute of the word in your life
[45:51] as you Amen that word look when when the
[45:55] word goes forth I think that's something
[45:58] that's so hard for us as we're we're in
[46:00] these little Tabernacles of flesh here
[46:03] and we see all the faults and failures
[46:05] when the word comes and speaks and says
[46:08] you never did it in the first place that
[46:10] says you're without spot or wrinkle I
[46:12] wonder if we if we reason within
[46:15] ourselves but no I appeal to that seat
[46:18] on the inside that predestinate apart
[46:20] that'll say yeah I'm not looking at the
[46:22] symptoms I'm not looking at the flesh
[46:24] but I'm looking to what the Lord says
[46:27] and if the word says it I say that's
[46:29] nothing but the truth Oh what are you
[46:32] saying you're perfect I'm saying what
[46:34] the Lord said that's that's what I'm
[46:37] told to do I'm gonna say what the Lord
[46:39] said if he said I'm his predestinate is
[46:41] he
[46:41] I'm as predestinated see that's nothing
[46:44] about the truth if he said I was in the
[46:45] mind of God before the world was ever
[46:47] formed that's nothing but the truth and
[46:50] he says my name was written in the
[46:51] Lamb's Book of Life
[46:52] before the world was ever for something
[46:55] aside he says that's nothing but the
[46:57] truth
[46:57] oh you don't have to take it up with me
[47:00] I'm not the one that said it if you got
[47:03] a problem when you take it up with my
[47:04] father you take it up with the creator
[47:07] of heavens of the earth I'm not the one
[47:09] that said it
[47:09] oh but that's what those religious
[47:13] spirits - oh they got a problem when the
[47:17] word is manifest they got a problem when
[47:19] the word takes on flesh why because it's
[47:21] threatening Satan's Kingdom oh my the
[47:25] only thing that has the power to
[47:27] overcome Satan's Kingdom is the Word
[47:30] made flesh and that's exactly what the
[47:32] Son of Man did when he came in that God
[47:35] was in tabernacle - spider-man oh he
[47:37] said I have power to lay my life down
[47:39] and I have power to take it up again
[47:41] Oh even in his truthful fiction when
[47:44] they were running that spirit to the
[47:46] side oh they might have taken some joy
[47:48] and satisfaction I don't know how to
[47:50] crucify our Savior but they were only
[47:52] fulfilling Scripture hallelujah even in
[47:55] his death he was talking and he rose on
[47:58] that third day victorious hallelujah oh
[48:02] praise the Lord
[48:04] he's the mighty Conqueror that's nothing
[48:09] but the truth and that's what the
[48:12] message is doing it's bringing forth a
[48:14] perfect word in your life bringing a
[48:18] manifestation the fruits of the spirit
[48:20] as we surrender and as we yield and as
[48:23] we say yay an amen - every word of God
[48:26] Matthew 15 22
[48:38] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[48:43] the same coasts and cried on him saying
[48:44] have mercy on me O Lord
[48:46] now son of David my daughter is
[48:50] grievously vexed with the devil
[48:53] and when you look at some of the
[48:55] accounts of brother Branham referring to
[48:57] this he says that she was vexed with a
[49:00] devil he says she had epilepsy who was
[49:03] that talking
[49:05] he says she had epilepsy and if you've
[49:10] ever I've seen somebody that's a battled
[49:13] battled that condition I remember my
[49:16] first time ever coming and into contact
[49:19] with somebody that was battling that I
[49:22] was at a pizza shopping and I was
[49:25] ordering some pizza and and I'd placed
[49:28] my order and the gentleman was looking
[49:29] at me and all of a sudden it just seemed
[49:31] something come over him and they all
[49:34] said he just became real distant and and
[49:36] at first I didn't know what I was doing
[49:38] but all in my heart right there just
[49:39] serving the Lord
[49:40] I watched something come over him and I
[49:43] was a believer and I saw them go to the
[49:45] ground and and and I realized what was
[49:48] taking place and I said I just felt I
[49:51] felt that the enemy had come in you know
[49:54] right into my presence he'd he just he
[49:56] just got taken advantage of somebody in
[49:58] my heart I felt I felt I felt for him I
[50:01] felt God or that that spirit just come
[50:04] in and and all of a sudden in an instant
[50:06] everything was going fine but in an
[50:08] instant all of a sudden this seizure
[50:11] broke out on him and I said oh my that's
[50:13] nothing but a spirit I just saw it for
[50:16] what it was and here the Prophet is
[50:18] saying that this this woman that came
[50:20] she had a daughter that was vexed with
[50:22] the devil he said it was epilepsy and oh
[50:24] my now my heart does I look at the store
[50:26] you can imagine this woman was desperate
[50:29] we don't know how long she had traveled
[50:32] we don't know how far she had gone we
[50:34] don't know how many episodes and how
[50:35] many times she saw her daughter fall and
[50:37] hit her head over and over and over she
[50:40] said I must get to that man called Jesus
[50:43] well something was driving her I must
[50:46] get to the man and I can imagine
[50:48] she got closer and she got closer and
[50:50] very wise oh you're something in this
[50:53] for you just hang on now
[50:55] I'm here closer and closer and there he
[50:57] was and she thinks oh my I finally made
[51:02] it to him and he says here's the one
[51:08] that can fix everything
[51:09] just one word he can fix everything and
[51:13] oh maybe the whole journey she's been on
[51:16] this whole time and now she's finally
[51:18] come to what oh this is the answer this
[51:21] is the one I've heard of the miracles
[51:23] if the anyone could do it I know he can
[51:25] do it o Lord thou son of David my
[51:32] daughter is grievously vexed with a
[51:35] devil but he answered her not a word
[51:39] well how many times have you made your
[51:41] petition known and you feel like he
[51:45] doesn't answer you a word and his
[51:48] disciples came and besought him saying
[51:50] send her away for she crieth after us oh
[51:52] my now the disciples don't want none to
[51:55] do with it oh yeah you know sitting this
[51:58] troublemaker away she's she's one of
[52:00] those fanatics she's one of this I'll
[52:02] just get her away but then he answered
[52:07] and said I am NOT sent but unto the lost
[52:11] sheep of the house of Israel oh look at
[52:15] this persistence look at this
[52:19] desperation then came she and worshipped
[52:23] him saying lord help me oh my now she's
[52:29] coming now she's entering into that
[52:31] burden and she's there say O God O Lord
[52:35] have helped me and now in this mother's
[52:38] heart cry for her daughter but he
[52:42] answered and said it is not meet to take
[52:45] the children's bread and cast it to dogs
[52:50] Oh how many of us would have given up
[52:54] right there you know what if that's the
[52:57] way you're gonna treat me okay you don't
[53:00] know everything that I've been through
[53:01] you don't know how long I've been
[53:04] praying and how many years I've been
[53:06] looking for this moment and that's how
[53:07] you're gonna treat me and you say here
[53:09] you have the love of God you're the son
[53:11] of God
[53:12] oh how many how many people would walk
[53:14] away right there you've been believing
[53:16] something for hours and days and weeks
[53:19] and months and months turn into years
[53:21] and years turn them into more years and
[53:23] all that Devils there to buffman at you
[53:26] and say well well isn't really a healer
[53:28] I want you to stay right there and
[53:32] something in your heart when you hear
[53:34] him say by his stripes I'm healed you
[53:37] say that's nothing but the truth no
[53:39] matter what the circumstance looks like
[53:41] no matter how bad the symptoms look no
[53:44] matter how many times you've prayed no
[53:46] matter how many times you've laid
[53:47] yourself at the altar you stay right
[53:50] there with the word oh but he said it's
[53:56] answer said it's not meet to take the
[53:58] children's bread and cast it to dogs see
[54:00] she wasn't a Jew
[54:01] the revival wasn't to our people she
[54:04] wasn't a Jew and she gets to him and he
[54:08] says it's not me to take the children's
[54:10] bread and give it to dogs called her a
[54:12] dog this story is not going the right
[54:15] direction for this mothers whose
[54:18] daughter was vexed with an epileptic
[54:20] devil and now she's gotten to the feet
[54:23] of Jesus and now she's worshiping me and
[54:25] she's saying those words Oh for any
[54:27] human to hearing other humans say help
[54:29] me or something is just from a human
[54:31] heart would rise up say Lola what's
[54:33] wrong hope you're in your backyard in
[54:36] the grocery store hear that crying help
[54:38] me only you respond to it it's just
[54:39] human nature and hearing how she is
[54:41] before seasons help me oh my god is it
[54:45] is molding and bringing for us a
[54:48] character during this trial oh he knew
[54:51] what was inside of this woman I believe
[54:54] she was a predestinated
[54:55] Oh something inside of her identified in
[54:58] her heart is that I know that that's the
[55:01] word the prophet of God see how real
[55:08] faith so he calls her a dog and the next
[55:13] verse is and she said truth Lord yet the
[55:17] dogs eat the crumbs which fall from
[55:20] theirs master table I feel like that
[55:22] sometimes maybe when when the lot falls
[55:25] me to stand behind the sacred desk I say
[55:27] you know I don't God if just a few
[55:29] crumbs could come from the table if you
[55:32] can just to get a few crumbs tonight
[55:33] from the master's table I believe it's
[55:35] more than can sustain every need if you
[55:38] my faith in that word if you just look
[55:40] for a scripture just look for a quote oh
[55:42] I might not be the best orator I might
[55:44] be the pastor's son and I might just be
[55:46] our brother David McGary son and I might
[55:50] have the littlest of all that is all we
[55:52] do i do just read a scripture and read a
[55:54] quote and it can strike that seat on the
[55:56] inside and you'll see that's nothing but
[55:58] the truth I believe it'll bring Jesus
[56:00] Christ on the scene in your time of need
[56:02] oh if you could just have this same
[56:04] expectation right now towards the Lord
[56:07] truth Lord you have two dogs eat the
[56:09] crumbs from the master's table the
[56:12] Prophet says see how the real faith will
[56:14] witness the word to be truth color or a
[56:19] dog well something insider said if it's
[56:24] him speaking if he's the one that said
[56:26] it that it's true Lord if that's what
[56:31] you're saying to me tonight it's true
[56:33] Lord if this is the house of correction
[56:36] and you're coming by my way to correct
[56:38] me if I gotta clean up my act if I've
[56:40] been having the wrong expectation
[56:41] towards the services if I've been
[56:43] wondering what in the world is our
[56:44] church doing why are we still streaming
[56:47] why do that many people go or to the
[56:49] house of God and then set up all the
[56:51] streaming when maybe we shouldn't be
[56:52] gathering all oh let's get out of that
[56:54] type of thinking now start looking away
[56:57] to Jesus Christ
[56:58] let's look to the author and the
[56:59] finisher of our faith see how the real
[57:04] faith will witness the word to be true
[57:06] truth Lord what the dogs are willing to
[57:08] eat the scraps under the master's table
[57:11] he said for this saying this is the
[57:13] profit taking description I said for
[57:16] this sale your child is healed she said
[57:22] the right thing in that crucial moment
[57:25] when it looked to me all was lost she
[57:29] said the right thing proverbs says death
[57:33] and life are in the power of the tongue
[57:37] and I want to say you have to say the
[57:40] right thing - the right thing and you
[57:41] have to say the right thing - the wrong
[57:43] thing because that's exactly what
[57:48] happened to Eve he didn't say the right
[57:51] thing in the hour of temptation we were
[57:54] studying here the church age book and
[57:57] the Prophet says that Eve Eve fell to
[58:00] the personal temptation of Satan by
[58:02] failing to use the word now why don't we
[58:05] just start taking a little inventory in
[58:07] our lives we start thinking about the
[58:10] personal temptations that we are faced
[58:12] with on a daily basis maybe we're not
[58:15] you know not being faced with worldly
[58:17] things but we're faced being faced with
[58:19] how we spend our time how we treat our
[58:22] wife and our children we're facing the
[58:25] fine-tuning of being the Word made flesh
[58:28] to our family the Word made flesh to our
[58:31] neighbor the Word made flesh to our boss
[58:33] to turn our cheek we are the Word made
[58:37] flesh in this hour in this bride coming
[58:39] of God where where else is this world
[58:42] going to receive the word where else is
[58:44] this word or gonna see Jesus Christ the
[58:46] same yesterday today and forever except
[58:48] in you
[58:55] personal temptation the lust of the
[58:57] flesh the lust of the eye and the pride
[58:59] of life my how many of us maybe don't
[59:03] realize that your personal temptation is
[59:05] education
[59:07] maybe you're seeking a career over the
[59:09] mind of God that's something we need to
[59:12] be sensitive to maybe money a career
[59:15] women popularity your job look all of
[59:21] these things can be personal temptation
[59:23] oh the snare that is out there here in
[59:28] Satan's Eden you know people gain fame
[59:30] and popularity on the internet maybe you
[59:34] realize your Instagram account I wonder
[59:37] how many people are following you and I
[59:40] wonder why because if you're following
[59:43] Jesus Christ I wonder if they would want
[59:47] to follow you anymore I wonder what
[59:49] you're testifying about I wonder if
[59:52] you're what's on your pictures and
[59:55] what's in your profile and what's your
[59:57] status they call it Oh does your status
[1:00:01] say that I've accepted the message of
[1:00:04] Malachi 4 does your status say that I
[1:00:08] believe that revelations 10 seven has
[1:00:11] been fulfilled is your status searching
[1:00:14] for lost souls what what do you want
[1:00:18] your personal temptation I don't know
[1:00:20] I've never had an Instagram account I've
[1:00:22] never had a snapchat but I've seen the
[1:00:25] things that it does I've seen the
[1:00:28] temptation it is to our youth I've seen
[1:00:31] what online in the internet and how this
[1:00:33] personal kids I tell you what it's more
[1:00:35] personal than it's ever been Saints you
[1:00:38] walk around we're not eating others
[1:00:40] devices and we pack that little black
[1:00:41] box around in our pocket all day long
[1:00:43] and I'd add a a swipe of a finger you
[1:00:47] can have all those Satan's even at your
[1:00:49] disposal as time we start getting a
[1:00:53] Bible in our hand time we start getting
[1:00:55] a message book in our hand god help us
[1:00:58] to be good examples to our family and to
[1:01:00] our sister to our kids we we show what
[1:01:04] why would we
[1:01:06] we spend their time doing we show value
[1:01:08] to it and we wonder why our kids want to
[1:01:10] play with their cell phones it's cuz
[1:01:12] you're on it all the time they see what
[1:01:14] mommy and daddy are giving priority to
[1:01:16] so they think it's important let's see
[1:01:19] we have personal temptations as the word
[1:01:22] is fine-tuning us here this last day
[1:01:24] that we got to give ourselves over to
[1:01:26] the Lord that the word is correcting you
[1:01:29] right now oh we're not hired ability to
[1:01:31] say brother Matthew that's nothing but
[1:01:33] the truth you're speaking to me right
[1:01:35] now and I believe if this is the closing
[1:01:38] times in history
[1:01:40] why am i playing around why am i
[1:01:42] friending people on Instagram why am i
[1:01:45] following people when you go onto their
[1:01:47] account and you can see endless results
[1:01:50] of lonely people and war only pictures
[1:01:52] and you're endorsing it and saying you
[1:01:56] identify with the revealed Christ of the
[1:01:59] hour and yet you're identifying with the
[1:02:02] world
[1:02:02] oh shake yourself now now let's get me
[1:02:07] on the ways of men let's let's come up
[1:02:09] higher oh we've been set up on a rock
[1:02:12] the strong rock the revelation in the
[1:02:14] hour that we're living in we got to fly
[1:02:16] above although all the ways of the world
[1:02:19] Church I believe that's why we're not Oh
[1:02:22] crying out for a body change because
[1:02:25] maybe we're just a little too complacent
[1:02:27] we're just a little too comfortable here
[1:02:30] and ladies here Mari we have all the
[1:02:33] nice things I mean why why do we need to
[1:02:36] go anywhere but you know that's the good
[1:02:38] that comes out of being a little sick
[1:02:40] that's the good that comes out of having
[1:02:42] a little trial each other
[1:02:44] it's just start to get a little hunger
[1:02:46] in your heart say Lord I don't want to
[1:02:48] be here anymore and I would pray that
[1:02:51] that the brothers or the prophet talks
[1:02:53] about a lien it's sad that it's human
[1:02:55] nature but we just become so slothful we
[1:02:58] get so swab when I say old God let us
[1:03:01] come into desperation tonight
[1:03:04] that is cut away from the things of the
[1:03:06] world let's get down to business with
[1:03:09] God whatever the personal temptation is
[1:03:11] in my life Lord I'm
[1:03:13] down at the altar now your Holy Spirit
[1:03:15] and fire come down and purge my life
[1:03:17] Lord fill every fiber of my being Lord
[1:03:20] maybe you and you alone that surging
[1:03:22] through these hands and through this
[1:03:24] mind and through these lips Lord and
[1:03:25] through my feet
[1:03:26] may it be you Lord and Taplin acting
[1:03:28] yourself and flesh again oh it's not not
[1:03:31] what he spoke of in the last days it's
[1:03:33] not not what he said
[1:03:35] oh the Prophet was the first one to
[1:03:37] maturity but there's a whole field of
[1:03:39] wheat seed right behind him coming into
[1:03:42] that full maturity of the word Oh God
[1:03:46] let that be me hard man I give over to
[1:03:50] the things of the world Lord may I lay
[1:03:52] Oliver down tonight Lord may I cut ties
[1:03:55] with with those personal temptations
[1:03:58] that keep buffeting at my flesh well
[1:04:01] we're moving on Saints let's keep going
[1:04:03] that's nothing but the truth Oh in any
[1:04:06] moment we're going to take our last step
[1:04:10] on this side Jesus overcame by the word
[1:04:16] and right now let me say that this is
[1:04:20] the only way to be an overcomer also is
[1:04:26] the only way that you can know if you're
[1:04:28] overcoming because the word can't fail
[1:04:33] that's nothing but the truth man shall
[1:04:38] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:04:40] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:04:44] God and I want to say you have to
[1:04:46] receive the word you have to believe the
[1:04:49] word confession is made unto salvation
[1:04:55] we know that life comes by the word the
[1:04:57] word is light when it's manifesting like
[1:05:01] it was in the beginning he said let
[1:05:03] there be light and that's the what the
[1:05:06] word is doing in this hour it's
[1:05:08] quickening the seed that is inside of
[1:05:11] you it's quickening the seed to life by
[1:05:13] the Holy Ghost all right that's what the
[1:05:17] word is doing it is bringing you into a
[1:05:19] position as you say yeah
[1:05:21] amen to that word now that spirit comes
[1:05:24] upon that seed and upon that life and
[1:05:27] you are being quickened oh the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost what is it quickening power we
[1:05:37] know that when it's the Holy Spirit
[1:05:38] inside of you
[1:05:39] it says amen to every word of God and
[1:05:43] that's maybe just another way of saying
[1:05:45] what's on our heart tonight is to say
[1:05:49] amen to every word of God forsaking our
[1:05:52] ideas forsaking our comforts getting
[1:05:57] into a desperation for a body change
[1:06:00] hunger in and thirsting for more of God
[1:06:05] searching for lost souls doing our part
[1:06:08] not just a head knowledge Church not
[1:06:11] just a head knowledge let's read out of
[1:06:13] John 5:24
[1:06:30] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:06:33] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:06:36] that sent me hath everlasting life they
[1:06:40] shall not come into condemnation but is
[1:06:42] passed from death unto life out of the
[1:06:46] rising of the Sun the prophet says the
[1:06:47] right word there in the Greek in the
[1:06:49] original it says he that understandeth
[1:06:52] my words now to prove that that's right
[1:06:55] I go down here and here's a drunk coming
[1:06:58] along the street with some other man's
[1:06:59] wife on his arms and cussing and taking
[1:07:02] God's name in vain and everything else
[1:07:04] like that say did you hear what the
[1:07:06] preacher said did you yeah I heard it
[1:07:09] that don't mean he got si ternal life
[1:07:12] see he that understandeth my word and
[1:07:16] the Prophet says he that understand is
[1:07:19] my word he that is an eagle Oh
[1:07:21] hallelujah not a chicken
[1:07:24] not a make believer not an unbeliever
[1:07:26] not a Pharisee not some religious a
[1:07:29] person with with well that's filled
[1:07:31] their head with a bunch of knowledge I
[1:07:33] might not have know at all not some
[1:07:36] person who thinks he's a walking Bible
[1:07:38] and just because he's memorized every
[1:07:39] scripture and every time you try to
[1:07:40] witness truth to him and tell your
[1:07:42] testimony all they have an answer for
[1:07:44] you they always have something to say oh
[1:07:46] but this is to the eagle it's to the
[1:07:48] predestinated jesus said my sheep hear
[1:07:51] my voice and a stranger they will not
[1:07:53] follow just reading out of John 10 24
[1:08:10] he says then came the Jews round about
[1:08:14] him and said unto Him how long does
[1:08:17] they'll make us to doubt if there'll be
[1:08:19] the Christ tell us plainly
[1:08:22] I am NOT something they're blaming Jesus
[1:08:27] for their unbelief how long will you
[1:08:32] make us doubt tell us plainly and I
[1:08:35] believe they were just looking for more
[1:08:37] evidence they just wanted him to indict
[1:08:40] himself they're like hey man and some of
[1:08:44] them would argue amongst themselves man
[1:08:46] this guy has a devil and like well man I
[1:08:48] don't know you opened the blind man's
[1:08:50] eyes I mean can a devil do that and so
[1:08:52] now they're learning around themselves
[1:08:54] and so the Jews you're coming tomorrow
[1:08:55] let's settle this once and for all I
[1:08:57] mean it is this guy who he says he is or
[1:08:59] or maybe you at least say something
[1:09:00] that'll self incriminate him and verse
[1:09:04] 24 he says then came the Jews round
[1:09:07] about him and said and how long does now
[1:09:09] make us to doubt if thou be the Christ
[1:09:11] tell us plainly and jesus answered and
[1:09:14] said I told you and ye believed not the
[1:09:17] works that I do and my father's name
[1:09:20] they bear witness of me now I could
[1:09:25] never help whenever I read scripture to
[1:09:28] think of the testimony of what God has
[1:09:30] done in our generation every time I read
[1:09:34] it because according to scripture God
[1:09:36] has come once again an entire natural to
[1:09:39] himself inside of a vessel and prove
[1:09:42] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:09:45] forever and the same works that he did
[1:09:50] back there he did here and something in
[1:09:54] my heart says that's nothing but the
[1:09:57] truth but all of the religious Pharisees
[1:09:59] and all of the religious systems and
[1:10:02] everything oh they they can't see it why
[1:10:05] but ye believe not because ye are not my
[1:10:10] sheep oh that just makes them even more
[1:10:14] bad in it funny how people can walk away
[1:10:17] from the message and they say that it's
[1:10:19] wrong but they can't
[1:10:21] live without attacking it oh it's just
[1:10:24] something that's almost just eats Adam
[1:10:26] in their conscience because something in
[1:10:29] a nose there's something about that that
[1:10:31] must be right oh my goodness and they
[1:10:34] walk away from it and they attack it and
[1:10:36] they take an antichrist spirit towards
[1:10:39] the word because ye are not my sheep as
[1:10:43] I said unto you my sheep hear my voice
[1:10:46] and I know them and they follow me
[1:10:49] and I give unto them eternal life and
[1:10:51] they shall never perish neither shall
[1:10:54] any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:10:56] that might sound simple but that's
[1:10:58] talking about you he has given you
[1:11:01] eternal life you shall never perish no
[1:11:04] one could ever pluck you out of his hand
[1:11:06] my father which gave them to me is
[1:11:08] greater than all and no man is able to
[1:11:09] pluck them out of my father's hand I a
[1:11:12] my father are one then the Jews took up
[1:11:15] stones took up stones again this wasn't
[1:11:20] the first run-in well see they weren't
[1:11:22] his sheep my sheep hear my voice and a
[1:11:26] stranger they will follow
[1:11:28] now what about today what does the
[1:11:30] scripture say as it was in the days of
[1:11:33] Noah so shall it be in the days of the
[1:11:36] revealing of the son of man now we're
[1:11:38] bringing it down home what are you going
[1:11:40] to say about the word made flesh and our
[1:11:43] day my sheep know my voice in a stranger
[1:11:47] they won't follow Oh in the days of the
[1:11:50] revealing of the son of man out of the
[1:11:52] rise of the Son of Man he says who is
[1:11:54] this son of man in the beginning was the
[1:11:57] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:11:59] Word was God the Word was made flesh and
[1:12:02] dwelt among us the Son of Man was the
[1:12:04] word made flesh and dwelt among us the
[1:12:08] word had been spoken and now the Word
[1:12:11] was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and
[1:12:13] now we're living in the hour of the
[1:12:14] revealing of the son of man and the
[1:12:16] Prophet says that word again is waved
[1:12:19] over the people that the dead traditions
[1:12:22] of man is dead and the Son of God is
[1:12:24] alive again with the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:27] Spirit right among
[1:12:29] and is giving us life I say Amen I
[1:12:32] believe it oh you might be in a place
[1:12:35] where it's not all adding up but if you
[1:12:36] can just find somewhere in your heart by
[1:12:39] faith to say the old brother Matthew I
[1:12:41] can't explain everything about the
[1:12:43] revealing of the son of eret I don't
[1:12:44] understand everything about the seven
[1:12:46] seals but I do know something something
[1:12:48] in my heart knows that that was a man of
[1:12:50] God something in my heart believe he's a
[1:12:52] prophet according to what the scripture
[1:12:54] says and I'm putting my faith in that
[1:12:57] it's the truth and I'm saying that's
[1:12:58] nothing but the truth you keep believing
[1:13:01] you keep laying on that right there you
[1:13:03] keep praying about it you keep reading
[1:13:06] your Bible you keep listening to the
[1:13:08] message you allow that spirit to come
[1:13:10] quick in the word to you for this great
[1:13:14] scripture of revelations 10:1 and I saw
[1:13:19] another mighty angel come down from
[1:13:20] heaven clothed with a cloud and the
[1:13:22] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:13:24] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:13:28] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:13:32] little book open and he said his right
[1:13:34] foot upon the sea and his left foot on
[1:13:36] the earth and cried with a loud voice as
[1:13:38] when a lion roars and we need cried
[1:13:41] seven thunders uttered their voices when
[1:13:44] the seven thunders had uttered their
[1:13:45] voices I was about to write and I heard
[1:13:49] a voice from heaven saying unto me seal
[1:13:51] up those things which the seven thunders
[1:13:54] uttered and write them not and just for
[1:13:58] times sake skipping to verse seven he
[1:14:02] says but in the days of the voice of the
[1:14:04] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:14:07] sound the mysteries of God should be
[1:14:09] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:14:12] servants the prophets I just want to
[1:14:15] take a little time here this is rather
[1:14:16] random preaching the seventh seal he
[1:14:21] says now I want to make this real clear
[1:14:24] every time every time that these seals
[1:14:28] has come to this come to the place
[1:14:31] everything that I ever believed on them
[1:14:34] and have read of other people has been
[1:14:37] contrary to what come to me in the room
[1:14:42] and when I asked you what was coming to
[1:14:43] him in the room what was this angel of
[1:14:48] revelations 10 1 through 7 who was this
[1:14:51] mighty angel coming down with an open
[1:14:54] book in his hand that a prophet which
[1:14:57] stand there preaching the seventh seal
[1:14:59] and saying I want to let you know I want
[1:15:01] to make this very clear that what I have
[1:15:06] received now is completely different
[1:15:08] from everything that I've ever thought
[1:15:10] the whole Bible has become a brand-new
[1:15:13] book to me what is taking place here
[1:15:15] what a STIs sin that all the Lord has
[1:15:18] descended with an open book in hand he
[1:15:23] says you notice now for the endtime
[1:15:28] message this seal after all he's
[1:15:31] revealed all six but it don't say
[1:15:33] nothing about the seventh and the
[1:15:35] endtime seal when it starts will be
[1:15:37] absolutely a total secret according to
[1:15:40] the Bible before knowing that remember
[1:15:42] revelations 10 1 through 7 at the end of
[1:15:46] the seventh angels message all the
[1:15:47] mysteries of God would be known we're at
[1:15:50] the end time the opening of the seventh
[1:15:53] seal and he goes on to say we find that
[1:15:56] Christ the Lamb took the book in his
[1:15:59] hand and he opened that seventh seal but
[1:16:03] you see it's a hidden mystery no one
[1:16:06] knows it right along with what he said
[1:16:08] no one would know his coming they also
[1:16:11] would not know about this seventh under
[1:16:14] mystery you see it's connected together
[1:16:16] you understand that's the third pole
[1:16:18] that had been prophesied all of those
[1:16:21] years before or what did he say it's not
[1:16:23] a public show I'll meet you in there on
[1:16:26] the third pole isn't to the world it's a
[1:16:32] personal revealing of Jesus Christ to
[1:16:34] his bride and invisible union of the
[1:16:37] heavenly bride with the bridegroom with
[1:16:39] an earthly bride Oh Oh the love can't
[1:16:42] see what's going on they can't see
[1:16:45] what's taking place but there's a union
[1:16:47] between the Bride of Christ that has
[1:16:50] been revealed to her she has received
[1:16:52] Terme she has received her hot ship in
[1:16:54] the sour yes baby to work through this
[1:16:59] just John 14:12 says verily I say unto
[1:17:02] you he that believeth on me the works
[1:17:05] that I do shall he do also and greater
[1:17:08] works than these shall he do because I
[1:17:11] go unto my father I can't I can't ever
[1:17:14] read this scripture the same anymore
[1:17:16] this wasn't the emphasis I was wanting
[1:17:18] to go on but the Prophet when he starts
[1:17:21] to preach I in Shalom there in 1964 he
[1:17:25] says I've interpreted this scripture
[1:17:27] more work a greater as more works
[1:17:29] because how could you do greater works
[1:17:31] than then turning water into wine but he
[1:17:33] says I I've interpreted many times like
[1:17:35] that he said oh but here in the last
[1:17:38] days it is greater works because oh if
[1:17:42] you look back when Jesus was on earth he
[1:17:43] took the wine and he took the water and
[1:17:47] he turned it into wine he took he took
[1:17:49] the bread and he multiplied it but he
[1:17:51] said in the last day greater once will
[1:17:53] you do where there was nothing he
[1:17:56] created squirrels proving that it was
[1:17:59] the same God back there they said let
[1:18:01] there be light have come in this hour
[1:18:04] and this generation and who was there
[1:18:06] speaking creation once again Oh
[1:18:09] revealing of the son of man who is this
[1:18:12] son of man it's none other than God
[1:18:14] veiled in flesh standing before you once
[1:18:17] again all performing the Masonic sign
[1:18:20] over and over and over and over the Word
[1:18:23] of God is sharper into any 200 sword oh
[1:18:26] whatever you're thinking whatever they
[1:18:28] need of it goes right down to the height
[1:18:30] of matter and will give you whatever you
[1:18:32] have neither
[1:18:33] oh and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:18:35] forever
[1:18:37] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[1:18:40] that will I do that the father may be
[1:18:44] glorified in the son if ye shall ask
[1:18:49] anything in my name I will do it now I'm
[1:18:54] praying as a burden upon the man of God
[1:18:58] in my heart that something is rising up
[1:19:01] in the believer tonight I don't care
[1:19:03] that here your your
[1:19:05] you're miles apart oh maybe you're
[1:19:10] you're out in Dallas maybe they're out
[1:19:13] in Fort Worth maybe you're out in
[1:19:14] Louisville
[1:19:16] maybe Ladin cranberry maybe you're in
[1:19:21] North personal Hills in Bedford but I
[1:19:24] want you to know that Jesus Christ knew
[1:19:27] that you would be listening to the word
[1:19:29] tonight and it's not a dead letter but
[1:19:34] if something inside of you can start
[1:19:36] rising up you know what would see maybe
[1:19:38] the most peculiar way I pray that the
[1:19:40] presence of the Lord would right now
[1:19:42] just sweep into your living room it was
[1:19:44] just coming here a household and all of
[1:19:47] a sudden something in your heart would
[1:19:49] say I've been hearing this all of these
[1:19:51] years over and over and over if ye shall
[1:19:54] ask anything in my name I will do it all
[1:19:58] if that predestinated scene could just
[1:20:01] say that's nothing but the truth I want
[1:20:03] you to know that the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:05] there to quicken to you whatever you
[1:20:08] have needles if he love me keep my
[1:20:12] Commandments and I will pray the father
[1:20:13] and he shall give you another comforter
[1:20:16] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:20:21] the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:20:23] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:20:25] neither knoweth him not but ye know him
[1:20:28] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:20:35] you I will not leave you comfortless I
[1:20:39] will come to you yet a little while
[1:20:41] oh my yet a little while and the world
[1:20:45] sees me no more but ye see me because I
[1:20:49] live he live also I believe it's in
[1:20:52] Christ the mystery says because I live
[1:20:54] you live also made us Verizon a Sonny he
[1:20:56] says speaking to his wife because I live
[1:21:01] Elam also speaking to you at that day ye
[1:21:04] shall know that I am in the father and
[1:21:06] ye and me and I am you he that hath my
[1:21:09] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[1:21:12] that loveth me and he that loveth me
[1:21:14] shall be loved of my father and I will
[1:21:17] love him and he will manage
[1:21:18] to myself to him and then Judas saith
[1:21:22] unto Him not Iscariot Lord how is it
[1:21:26] that that will manifest myself unto us
[1:21:29] and out into the world I believe that is
[1:21:33] the same question that many people ask
[1:21:35] in the hour that were standing in when
[1:21:38] we were beholding the coming of the Lord
[1:21:40] what did the prophets show us in the
[1:21:43] rapture message in 1st Thessalonians
[1:21:45] 4:16 what was it what is the show he
[1:21:48] said the Lord descends with a shout he
[1:21:51] said this shout is the message the bread
[1:21:54] of life it is the coming of the Lord
[1:21:56] coming for the bride how is the Lord
[1:21:59] gonna come in the whole world I know
[1:22:01] because it's not it's not revelations
[1:22:04] 1:7 that every eye will be Holden but
[1:22:07] it's revelations 15 16 as a thief in the
[1:22:10] night he has come he has failed himself
[1:22:13] he is coming the midnight hour and he
[1:22:16] snuck in for his little bride to catch
[1:22:18] her away all at the rising of the song
[1:22:21] hallelujah do you realize what you're a
[1:22:23] part of in this hour
[1:22:25] oh praise the Lord how is it that that
[1:22:30] would manifest myself my noise I'm out
[1:22:33] into the world or it makes me think of
[1:22:36] the disciples they're walking on the
[1:22:38] road to Emmaus hear Jesus Christ have
[1:22:40] done everything that he said he would do
[1:22:44] and not only that in howdy he did
[1:22:47] everything that he said he would do he's
[1:22:50] revealed the seals he manifested Malachi
[1:22:53] 4 he's revealed revelations 10 wonders
[1:22:56] heaven only we're living in the time of
[1:22:58] the revealing of the Son of man he has
[1:23:00] these tender with a shout oh the bread
[1:23:02] of life is gathered together abroad this
[1:23:05] is where we're at but yet where are we
[1:23:09] at church Oh slow of heart to believe
[1:23:13] all of the scripture and now on this
[1:23:17] road in Emmaus here the Lord comes it
[1:23:21] comes up here in Luke 24 25 and he says
[1:23:23] then said unto him why because here they
[1:23:26] are they're discouraged they're no
[1:23:30] trodden because the prophets
[1:23:32] in Christ the mystery of God revealed he
[1:23:34] says because they thought all of the
[1:23:36] suffering and everything that Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ went through was in vain and
[1:23:41] little church little bride if you think
[1:23:43] everything that we're going through
[1:23:45] right now is in vain Oh
[1:23:46] fools is full of heart I want you to
[1:23:49] know everything is working out for your
[1:23:51] good a far great way of Gloria waited
[1:23:54] for you because just in a moment in a
[1:23:56] twinkling of an eye or you just keep
[1:23:58] holding on
[1:23:59] you just keep pressing you just keep
[1:24:01] believing and that word is going to
[1:24:03] manifest in your time of need
[1:24:05] Oh fools a slow heart to believe all the
[1:24:10] prophets have spoken
[1:24:11] I'm not Christ to have suffered these
[1:24:14] things and to enter no glory I'm
[1:24:17] beginning at Moses and all the prophets
[1:24:20] he expounded them to them and all the
[1:24:23] scriptures and the things concerning
[1:24:24] himself I want you to say that's exactly
[1:24:27] what he'd done in this day he came
[1:24:30] himself again and a pillar of fire he
[1:24:34] came and bailed himself in the prophet
[1:24:36] named William Branham and he didn't
[1:24:38] start at the proof and Isaiah he started
[1:24:40] before the world was ever formed he went
[1:24:43] back in the deep part to mind in the
[1:24:45] mind of God and said that's right where
[1:24:47] you are all along I'm not in fact this
[1:24:49] whole program the reason why creation
[1:24:51] ever came into existence because God I
[1:24:53] have thought about you and he wanted to
[1:24:55] spend eternity with you and this whole
[1:24:57] program is about a bride that's living
[1:24:59] in the radio CH and you are she oh oh oh
[1:25:04] oh oh I want to believe all that the
[1:25:07] Scriptures have prophesied you are that
[1:25:10] bride you are the Lord this is the hour
[1:25:13] that we're living in in Christ the
[1:25:16] mystery of God revealed jesus said I

[1:25:22] when this revelation is made no you will
[1:25:25] know that I am in the father and the
[1:25:27] father in me and I in you and you and me
[1:25:29] when the revelation is made manifest at
[1:25:32] that day you shall know that I am in the
[1:25:34] father and the father are one

[1:26:05] a question once three for you once and
[1:26:07] for all you try to wonder what they open
[1:26:09] the book a man you try to wonder and put
[1:26:11] it all together just know this that that
[1:26:14] mighty angel that descended with an open
[1:26:17] book and hang and loose the seven seals
[1:26:19] and said according to revelations 10
[1:26:21] seven at the sounding of the seventh
[1:26:24] angel message when he begins to town
[1:26:27] what was he sounding that message that
[1:26:30] came to him in the room something that
[1:26:33] he knew nothing about it was a complete
[1:26:35] mystery because the seventh seal was a
[1:26:38] complete mute it was complete silent
[1:26:40] nobody knew anything about us coming it
[1:26:43] was a complete mystery but all of a
[1:26:45] sudden now at the rising of the Sun who
[1:26:49] took that picture up there and declared
[1:26:51] it was the supreme judge they took the
[1:26:54] picture testified that he first declares
[1:26:57] it in the heavens first o mine that he
[1:27:00] came there in March and Jeffersonville
[1:27:02] and revealed the seals he is the one who
[1:27:05] opened those seals he has those seals
[1:27:07] for the whole Word of God as Christ and
[1:27:10] Christ is the seals that was open what
[1:27:15] is the opening of the seals then
[1:27:17] revealing Christ and the very seven
[1:27:22] angels which represented the seven
[1:27:24] churches all completed and we couldn't
[1:27:26] even see it
[1:27:27] they took the picture not us
[1:27:30] and there he is standing there supreme
[1:27:32] judge showing that he's Alpha and Omega
[1:27:35] the beginning in the end what
[1:27:38] identification cricketing power did that
[1:27:42] to us quickening power let us see his
[1:27:47] coming quickening power smashed us from
[1:27:52] death to life that's what the revealing
[1:27:54] of Christ is
[1:27:55] to this day it has smashed your little
[1:27:58] bride that didn't know who she was lost
[1:28:00] oh you had spiritual amnesia you didn't
[1:28:02] buy past your theophany you were just
[1:28:04] wandering around until you saw something
[1:28:06] familiar and then your eyes came up and
[1:28:10] you realize that's Christ my mate
[1:28:12] I came from God I'm going back to God
[1:28:16] what is it it's the word again being
[1:28:19] waved over the people that the dead
[1:28:22] traditions a man is dead the Son of God
[1:28:24] is alive again with a baptism of the
[1:28:26] Holy Spirit ride among us and giving us
[1:28:29] life oh the son of man is Christ Church
[1:28:32] he's the one that you're feeding on my
[1:28:36] all of the saints streaming we have an
[1:28:39] extra twenty thirty minutes because you
[1:28:41] don't have to drive home that all right
[1:28:45] we just focus here a little bit my we
[1:28:47] have just a handful here and there
[1:28:49] they're pulling so wonderfully on the
[1:28:50] Word of God as I just want to get to my
[1:28:53] sermon now oh my if we could just press
[1:28:58] through this for another ten minutes
[1:28:59] maybe he said the son of the son of man
[1:29:02] is Christ he's the one you're feeding on
[1:29:04] look the headship has come to the body
[1:29:07] because I live yearly of also speaking
[1:29:10] to his wife and now in Revelations 10
[1:29:13] eight and the voice which I heard from
[1:29:15] heaven spake unto me and said go and
[1:29:18] take the little book which is opened in
[1:29:20] the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:29:22] upon the sea and upon the earth not to
[1:29:24] take too much time but it was in
[1:29:26] revelations chapter five when John was
[1:29:28] standing there and nobody was worthy to
[1:29:30] take the book
[1:29:30] why because something now has taken
[1:29:33] place
[1:29:34] oh the lamb has come for redemption
[1:29:36] claims he's taken the book and he's
[1:29:39] opened the book and we have found out
[1:29:41] that our name is on that book and now
[1:29:43] that he's descended in the seals have
[1:29:44] been opened what is he saying now he's
[1:29:47] saying to you take the book and a voice
[1:29:50] that I heard spake to me get us it go
[1:29:51] and take the little bit which is open in
[1:29:53] the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:29:55] upon the sea and upon the earth and I
[1:29:58] went unto the angel and said unto Him
[1:30:00] now I remember what we're talking about
[1:30:02] the things we say saying the right thing
[1:30:05] saying that's nothing but the church
[1:30:07] truth
[1:30:08] I'm wanting to come into something now
[1:30:10] said I went under angel now what is he
[1:30:13] doing he said unto him give me the
[1:30:15] little book well that sounds a little
[1:30:17] who do you think you are
[1:30:19] he's only doing what the word told him
[1:30:22] to do the angel told him grow and take
[1:30:28] the book now according to that word he
[1:30:31] calms and says give me the little book
[1:30:33] and said unto me take it and eat it up
[1:30:35] and it shall make thy belly bitter and
[1:30:37] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[1:30:39] and I took the little book out of the
[1:30:41] Angels hand and ate it up and it was in
[1:30:43] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:30:45] heated up my belly was bitter and he
[1:30:47] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:30:50] before many peoples and nations and
[1:30:53] tongues and kings thou must prophesy
[1:30:57] again o our brother Matthew what should
[1:30:59] I say or why should I do what am I
[1:31:01] supposed to prophesy about oh let me
[1:31:04] just let you in on a little secret a
[1:31:05] spoken word is the original seed 1962 oh
[1:31:09] here is the secret the word is in the
[1:31:13] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:31:16] what he wants done with the word and she
[1:31:19] does it in his name she has thus saith
[1:31:22] the Lord
[1:31:23] Oh church you have received as the
[1:31:26] second Lord in this hour you have
[1:31:29] received Christ the opening of the Lord
[1:31:32] Paul says in Romans 10 verse 8 he says
[1:31:36] but what saith it
[1:31:45] maybe we'll read a quote real quick I
[1:31:47] hope we're feeling all right praise the
[1:31:51] Lord
[1:31:52] I hope we're hanging in there I'm on the
[1:31:54] stream I believe everybody's pooling
[1:31:57] real hard I know I know Kozma and
[1:31:59] Jackson said they were going to be be
[1:32:00] the third pole pooler's or something
[1:32:05] like that and I thought praise the Lord
[1:32:08] maybe I'll just title my sermon that but
[1:32:13] all this mystery is revealed only as he
[1:32:15] promised to his bride hell is against
[1:32:20] this truth of the revelation of this
[1:32:23] mystery but the bride is standing on it
[1:32:26] that's her stand
[1:32:29] why do you hunger church why do you
[1:32:32] thirst it's the father trying to reveal
[1:32:37] this hidden secret to you but you let so
[1:32:40] many things get it out of you you let
[1:32:42] your job you let your wife you let your
[1:32:45] husband you let your children well he's
[1:32:50] identifying things that seem really
[1:32:51] necessary
[1:32:52] I say we pray God give me a revelation

[1:33:00] am I not manifesting Christ to my wife
[1:33:03] and to my husband am I am I not

[1:33:17] Pharisees this is a love letter to you
[1:33:19] this is Jesus Christ speaking directly
[1:33:22] to your heart and I wonder if we're
[1:33:25] gonna say Lord that's nothing but the
[1:33:27] truth but you let so many things get it
[1:33:31] out of you you let your job you let your
[1:33:33] wife now I want you to say this is a
[1:33:34] husband speaking to his wife wanting
[1:33:37] fellowship warning Communion wanting to
[1:33:39] manifest all the attributes in your life
[1:33:41] but we let so many things get it out of
[1:33:44] us we let so many things get it out of
[1:33:46] you your job your your life your wife
[1:33:48] you let your husband your children you

[1:33:56] your heart your thirsting you're hungry
[1:33:59] it's God trying to reveal it to you see
[1:34:02] the revelation the last day is here oh
[1:34:06] there ought to be a hunger in our heart
[1:34:08] to start saying Lord give me the book
[1:34:09] reveal it to me Lord this hidden mystery
[1:34:12] these seals this Christ is the mystery
[1:34:14] of God revealed I reveal it to me Lord
[1:34:16] I'm hungry I'm thirsty and I realize
[1:34:19] look too many things get out of me and
[1:34:22] Romans 10:8 he says but what saith it
[1:34:25] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[1:34:28] and in thy heart that is the Word of
[1:34:32] Faith which we preach that if thou shalt
[1:34:34] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:34:37] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[1:34:39] God hath raised him from the dead that
[1:34:42] shalt be saved for with the heart man
[1:34:44] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:34:46] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:34:49] salvation I'll just ask the musicians to
[1:34:52] come but I just really want to focus
[1:34:54] this really right here is the whole
[1:34:56] inspiration let's applaud my heart right
[1:34:59] here even on the internet stream and
[1:35:02] those that are with us we just want to
[1:35:04] focus through this last moment here for
[1:35:08] what the mouth confession is made unto
[1:35:10] salvation I want to say that it was it
[1:35:14] was howdy rights response as as brother
[1:35:18] Branham was was speaking about the
[1:35:21] second time the third pull had come into
[1:35:22] manifestation was speaking those
[1:35:24] squirrels first it was little fishy I
[1:35:26] give you back your life we saw that
[1:35:28] first manifestation wanted to do it
[1:35:30] resurrected an animal that was the first
[1:35:33] manifestation then the second one was he
[1:35:36] was out there and oh that the Spirit
[1:35:39] came to him and he didn't know what to
[1:35:41] ask for he said he spoke and said you
[1:35:43] have need of squirrels and so he spoke
[1:35:46] squirrels into existence and now here he
[1:35:50] is he's testifying of it and here howdy
[1:35:52] right is listening to the Prophet give
[1:35:55] testimony of the second manifestation of
[1:35:58] the third pool and the Prophet talks
[1:36:00] about now it was her response to the
[1:36:03] word it was how do you
[1:36:05] each response to the word made flesh
[1:36:07] Luke that was the spoken word that
[1:36:10] created a squirrel and made flesh where
[1:36:13] there was no squirrel and now here this
[1:36:15] little old lady who nothing make $200 a
[1:36:21] year something like that she's sitting
[1:36:23] there as the Prophet is giving testimony
[1:36:25] and now her response to the word made
[1:36:28] manifest brings the third pull in the
[1:36:31] manifestation for the third time and
[1:36:33] Apophis said for the first time upon a
[1:36:36] human being and what did it bring what
[1:36:40] did it bring forth innate way for
[1:36:43] salvation and the Lord said why because
[1:36:48] he knew what she would ask for oh I
[1:36:51] believe it is a bride here that has thus
[1:36:54] saith the Lord
[1:36:55] and that the anointing at the third pole
[1:36:57] can come upon you and you're so in tune
[1:37:00] with the mind of God you have that said
[1:37:02] the Lord that when the anointing comes
[1:37:04] upon you you can speak the word and it
[1:37:06] coming the manifestation
[1:37:08] I almost prophesy again hallelujah oh if
[1:37:13] there ever was a people who can say the
[1:37:15] right thing and manifested it is the
[1:37:19] bride where is the third pole in
[1:37:22] manifestation where is the opening of
[1:37:24] the word well is the revealing of Christ
[1:37:27] in the bride the stand
[1:37:30] Oh hallelujah hallelujah first John 4:2
[1:37:37] says hereby know ye the Spirit of God
[1:37:40] every spirit that confesses that Jesus
[1:37:42] Christ has come in the flesh is of God
[1:37:45] now remember we're not talking about
[1:37:47] just a hearing and going and live in
[1:37:49] some other life but an understanding now
[1:37:52] hereby know ye the Spirit of God every
[1:37:55] spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ
[1:37:57] is come in the flesh is of God
[1:38:00] frans what are we looking at we are
[1:38:04] living in the hour of the revealing of
[1:38:05] the son of man hereby know ye the spirit
[1:38:09] or not every spirit that confesses that
[1:38:11] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
[1:38:13] God and every spirit that confesses not
[1:38:16] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[1:38:17] is not of God and this is that spirit of
[1:38:20] Antichrist where he have heard that
[1:38:23] should come and even now is in the world
[1:38:26] brother Branham speaking of Hattie ride
[1:38:28] in my new ministry in 59 he says he is
[1:38:35] just as much Jehovah Jireh today as he
[1:38:39] was on that mountain with Abraham he can
[1:38:41] still produce an animal to his glory
[1:38:43] these squirrels was not a vision I
[1:38:46] shocked him blood came out of him
[1:38:48] I dressed them and I eat them they was a
[1:38:50] visions they were squirrels I said that
[1:38:53] saved you over Jireh
[1:38:55] trying to get his promise over to me in
[1:38:58] my thickness and dullness of mind well
[1:39:02] that's just a tear in our church and I
[1:39:04] thik missing dullness of mine he he
[1:39:06] could speak my need into existence the
[1:39:09] same as he just speak Abraham's need
[1:39:12] into existence I'd know no more than
[1:39:15] said that until sister Hattie sitting
[1:39:19] there crying now hadn't said a word and
[1:39:21] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:39:24] she said the right thing Jesus had a
[1:39:28] good man out of the treasure of his
[1:39:29] heart brings forth that which is good
[1:39:32] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:39:34] of his heart bringeth forth with that
[1:39:36] which is evil for out of the abundance
[1:39:38] of the heart the mouth speaketh she
[1:39:44] identified with the word I want to say
[1:39:47] there was a treasure in Hattie Wright's
[1:39:49] heart and out of the abundance of her
[1:39:51] heart
[1:39:52] some man think it's in her heart oh she
[1:39:55] spoke those words that's nothing but the
[1:39:59] truth
[1:40:01] and I believe that's where we are as the
[1:40:02] Bride of Christ right now well what
[1:40:05] happens when to omnipotence meet church
[1:40:08] when God and man come together went to
[1:40:12] omnipotence means something gots to
[1:40:14] shake
[1:40:15] that's what revelation does it shakes
[1:40:17] away the darkness it shakes away their
[1:40:19] doubt it takes away the sin it takes
[1:40:22] away the guilt it takes away the
[1:40:23] unbelief all of the doubts is a
[1:40:26] dissolver of doubts
[1:40:27] whatever your disappointments are
[1:40:30] whatever your needs are I say this in
[1:40:33] the name of the Lord I don't want you to
[1:40:34] miss it now just in your home saying the
[1:40:38] right thing the Prophet said hearing and
[1:40:40] I have heard but now I said in that
[1:40:43] crucial moment now maybe you're in a
[1:40:46] crucial moment think of the men and the
[1:40:49] people that I'm acquainted with God by
[1:40:52] passing all the celebrities and
[1:40:54] everything to give a poor little humble
[1:40:57] woman can't even hardly sign her own
[1:40:59] name and he knowed what she'd asked for
[1:41:03] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:41:06] and when she said that the room felt
[1:41:09] like it was coming apart
[1:41:10] I wonder if right now with hands raised
[1:41:12] oh maybe we could just all agree
[1:41:15] together and then we will start feeling
[1:41:17] like the room is about to come apart oh
[1:41:19] because we're saying the right thing
[1:41:21] we're saying Amen Lord that's nothing
[1:41:24] but the truth well maybe your room will
[1:41:26] start coming apart by the presence of
[1:41:28] the Lord
[1:41:28] sweeping in there by bringing the
[1:41:30] anointing upon you all sickness will
[1:41:33] flee Devils cast out filled with the
[1:41:35] Holy Ghost why because the same girl
[1:41:37] home
[1:41:38] that provided a neighbor hammering on
[1:41:40] the mountain is the same God that was
[1:41:43] here tonight
[1:41:43] providing for his Brides every knee Oh
[1:41:47] hallelujah
[1:41:48] Oh hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus he's
[1:41:53] still Jehovah Jireh
[1:41:55] he's still discerning the thoughts and
[1:41:57] intents of the heart that's nothing but
