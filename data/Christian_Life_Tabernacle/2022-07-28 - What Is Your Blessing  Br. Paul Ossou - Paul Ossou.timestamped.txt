[36:27] let's open in genesis
[36:29] chapter 49
[36:35] we'll read from verse 1
[36:38] to 10
[36:42] and then we're going to go from
[36:45] 22 to 28.
[36:50] genesis chapter 49
[36:52] verse 10
[36:59] sorry verse 1 to 10.
[37:01] it says and jacob called unto
[37:04] his sons and
[37:06] and said
[37:07] gather yourselves together
[37:09] that i may tell you
[37:11] that which will befall you
[37:13] in the last days
[37:15] gather yourself together
[37:17] and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken
[37:20] unto israel your father
[37:23] reuben nawaz thou are my firstborn
[37:26] my might
[37:28] it says in
[37:29] the beginning of my strength the
[37:32] excellency of dignity and the excellency
[37:35] of power
[37:37] unstable as water that shall not excel
[37:40] because thou wentest up
[37:43] to the father's bed
[37:45] then defiled the fall dao
[37:48] de faldo he when he went up to
[37:51] my couch
[37:52] he said simon and levi are brethren
[37:56] instruments
[37:57] of cruelty
[37:59] are in
[38:00] the inhabitation
[38:02] oh my soul come not down into
[38:06] the secret
[38:07] unto the assembly mine honor
[38:11] be not thou
[38:12] united
[38:14] for in their anger they slew a man and
[38:17] in their
[38:19] self-will they dig down
[38:22] a wall
[38:23] cursed be their anger
[38:26] for it was fierce
[38:28] and the wrath for it was cruel
[38:31] i will divide them in jacob
[38:35] and scatter them in israel judah thou
[38:38] are
[38:39] he whom
[38:40] thy brethren shall praise
[38:43] says thy hand shall be in the neck of
[38:46] thine enemies
[38:47] thy father's children shall bow down
[38:50] before thee
[38:52] judah is a lion
[38:54] a lion's wealth
[38:56] it says from the prey
[38:59] my son thou gone up
[39:02] thou art gone up
[39:04] he stopped down
[39:05] he
[39:06] couched as a lion and as an old lion who
[39:11] shall rouse him up
[39:13] the scepter shall never
[39:15] shall not depart from judah
[39:18] no the
[39:19] lawgivers
[39:20] from between his feet
[39:23] united until until shallow shall come
[39:27] and unto him shall the gathering
[39:31] of the people be
[39:33] and then
[39:35] verse 22 it says
[39:37] joseph is is fruitful
[39:41] full bot
[39:42] even a fruit brought by a well
[39:45] whose branches run
[39:47] over the wall
[39:49] it says the arches
[39:51] have
[39:52] surely
[39:53] grieved him
[39:55] and shot at him
[39:57] and
[39:58] and
[40:00] and hatted him
[40:02] but his bow
[40:03] abode in strength
[40:06] and the arms of the i
[40:08] and the arms of his hand were made
[40:10] strong by the hand of the mighty god of
[40:14] jacob from hence
[40:16] is the shepherd from the stone of israel
[40:20] even
[40:23] even by the god thy f even by the god of
[40:27] thy father whom shall help thee
[40:31] and by the almighty who shall bless thee
[40:34] with blessings of heaven above the
[40:36] blessings of the deep
[40:39] that
[40:40] lieth under the blessings of the breast
[40:43] and of the womb the blessings of thy
[40:46] father have prevailed above the
[40:48] blessings of thy
[40:50] uh of the progenitors
[40:53] unto the outermost bound of the
[40:56] everlasting hills they shall be on the
[40:59] head of joseph and the crown
[41:04] of the head of him that was separate
[41:08] from his brother
[41:13] may the lord have the blessing to the
[41:15] reading of his word you may have your
[41:16] seats
[41:18] if you're quiet
[41:30] we saw this scripture where jacob at the
[41:33] end of his life
[41:36] or israel at the end of his life i
[41:39] played two seasons
[41:41] he was calling his children up so he
[41:43] could bless them
[41:46] eventually
[41:53] and as we read that scripture i would
[41:56] like to title
[41:57] uh my little message tonight and call it
[42:00] what is your blessing
[42:06] we see here jacob a man
[42:11] who's blessing his children keep on the
[42:14] benediction
[42:17] who's pronouncing blessings upon his
[42:20] children
[42:26] a person immortal man that we know his
[42:29] path
[42:31] we know what it was
[42:35] we know the grace that he received from
[42:37] the lord
[42:42] at the end of his life he
[42:44] he he added out blessings to to his
[42:47] children
[42:51] he told reuben it was his first born
[42:54] making available
[43:01] it was the first bone but it was not to
[43:03] be on on above the others
[43:08] because he went into his father's
[43:10] bedroom
[43:24] his soul he didn't want to get into
[43:26] their secret to see it pascal
[43:29] because in their anger
[43:34] they came and they slaughter they don't
[43:36] you don't treat it so they killed people
[43:44] it was talking about how israel jacob
[43:47] had a daughter
[43:48] unification there was a daughter named
[43:55] and in the pilgrimage there was a prince
[43:57] who came and and and and and
[44:00] and uh
[44:01] took the daughter
[44:06] and simeon and and liver i didn't like
[44:09] it
[44:13] and when
[44:14] uh when the king came to see israel
[44:20] to tell them about that my son went into
[44:23] my idiot daughter
[44:26] mariana if you can give us if you can
[44:28] give her to us so we can marry her
[44:30] simeon
[44:33] simeone and liver i propose
[44:39] they told how their father how they
[44:41] cannot give their daughter to an
[44:43] uncircumcised
[44:45] people
[44:47] that if they want if you if he wanted to
[44:49] take her
[44:50] do some purple dresses frequency that
[44:52] all the other people had to be
[44:54] circumcised well accepted the king
[44:57] accepted it
[44:58] concealed two less zombies
[45:00] he went and had everybody circumcised in
[45:03] his family
[45:05] and when they were in the pain
[45:10] that's when simeon and levi took their
[45:12] sword
[45:14] they went and they killed everybody
[45:16] ela
[45:19] and then when when jacob was here
[45:21] blessing them
[45:24] he realized he said i cannot associate
[45:27] myself to your anger
[45:32] and then for levi and simeon he said i'm
[45:35] going to separate you in israel
[45:38] i am going to disburse you
[45:43] and when it comes to judah you don't
[45:45] like him he gave him the priority of the
[45:47] first place
[45:52] he says the scepter will not go far will
[45:54] not go away from judah
[45:59] the the kingdom the the the
[46:02] the power will never go away from judah
[46:04] jesus
[46:06] until shalom comes
[46:08] i can do it he blessed every single one
[46:10] of them
[46:12] but when
[46:24] the blessing of the father on top of the
[46:27] blessing
[46:30] blessings from above and the blessings
[46:32] from be beneath joseph
[46:36] joseph received all manner of blessings
[46:39] economic says
[46:43] when we see all the children go on after
[46:46] the the george
[46:47] israel had gone
[46:52] on the ship to commerce club we know
[46:54] that there were uh slaves in egypt
[47:00] and we know that god brought him out of
[47:02] uh egypt with moses
[47:06] and when they get to the other side of
[47:08] jordan caller
[47:13] moses uh mission
[47:15] came to its end the jose here it was
[47:18] joshua was supposed to go forward with
[47:20] them they can't lose their land don't
[47:22] leave the issue
[47:29] we realized that from from verse 13 to
[47:32] verse uh
[47:34] from chapter 13 to chapter 15. 15
[47:40] until all the way up to chapter 19
[47:48] joshua is allotting or dividing the land
[47:51] of israel
[47:54] and when we get to verse 18 he haven't
[47:57] gone certainly chapter 18
[48:02] there were there was two tribes that
[48:04] didn't have uh land certificate
[48:08] there was no there was other tribes that
[48:10] didn't have the possession land yet
[48:16] and joshua is asking them to pick three
[48:18] people in each tribe dalek
[48:21] so they can go and explore the land
[48:26] because they had to fight for every
[48:29] piece of the
[48:30] ground
[48:32] one day
[48:44] in order for them to bring him the map
[48:46] so he can go and divide the land
[48:51] and we find out in chapter 18 of the
[48:53] book of joshua
[48:58] and there joshua is saying that levi
[49:00] will not have a place
[49:07] because levi his job was to be the the
[49:11] high priest or the priest of all of him
[49:13] a donkey left
[49:16] in other words levi didn't have a
[49:18] portion of the land he later dispersed
[49:21] he was dispersed in all israel come
[49:24] israel with jacob
[49:26] as israel or jacob said it in
[49:49] you find out in reality simeon didn't
[49:52] really have his own portion of land
[49:57] you find out that the portion that was
[49:59] belong that belonged to judah
[50:02] it was big they don't say donald trump
[50:05] and he was in the territory of judah
[50:08] that simion was placed
[50:24] we know all that according to the word
[50:26] because joseph's
[50:28] expression
[50:29] that joseph himself is the very
[50:31] expression of the blessing the
[50:33] expression of the prosperity it's the
[50:35] expression of prosperity
[50:38] a contest for the cell of my sister i
[50:41] conducted you you know when these
[50:42] children of israel walked with god
[50:45] as you one day
[50:47] is it a fatigued contribution yeah they
[50:50] were they were tired of the leadership
[50:52] of god if you leave warren welcome to
[50:56] lesotho
[50:58] they wanted to have a king like all the
[51:00] other countries
[51:03] they wanted to have a king like all the
[51:05] other nations it's not the level of
[51:06] prophet they went and taught
[51:09] the prophet samuel
[51:11] london that we want a king
[51:14] we want to have a king
[51:18] all right
[51:32] as god promised you something that you
[51:34] didn't get
[51:36] them why do you want a king
[51:40] why are you rejecting the leadership of
[51:43] god
[51:48] montreal
[51:56] what it would take or what what would
[51:58] happen when they if they would have a
[51:59] king you don't need a male ghost
[52:03] they said regardless of all of that they
[52:05] still wanted to have a king
[52:08] and look what happened
[52:12] when they decided to go and pick a king
[52:15] either
[52:29] there was no promise or
[52:36] that was saying that that the kingdom of
[52:38] the power will go to benjamin
[52:42] but
[52:43] saul the benjamin benjamites
[52:46] became king
[52:48] a doctor
[52:50] and in his kingdom
[52:52] he said confronted
[52:54] he came against goliath
[52:57] goliath laughing
[52:59] goliath caused child to tremble
[53:04] goliath caused uh saul and his army to
[53:07] tremble
[53:10] and i want you to realize this young man
[53:14] experienced
[53:15] who had no experience of the army
[53:19] who was just as a a shepherd as a simple
[53:23] shepherd
[53:24] he was his name was david
[53:27] but who knew
[53:29] the attributes that he was of the tribe
[53:31] of judah
[53:35] eleven new solutions
[53:37] he came on the field of battle
[53:40] mode
[53:47] he said who's this and circumcised who's
[53:50] cursing the army of the lord
[53:56] who's this unbeliever who's cursing the
[53:58] army of god
[54:01] i'm going to fight him
[54:04] all i said
[54:06] they tried to discourage him buddhist
[54:24] that he could take you and break every
[54:26] single bone in your body
[54:29] but david was not looking at that davis
[54:34] david knew that he was of the tribe of
[54:36] judah davin
[54:40] what david knew that samuel had already
[54:42] anointed him king thank you
[54:46] that one day he would get to the throne
[54:49] deficit of
[54:51] that everything every everything that
[54:54] came before him
[54:57] if there was one that was supposed to
[54:59] die
[55:02] he was convinced that it would not be
[55:04] him
[55:08] that's why he had the power or the
[55:10] courage to fight the lion
[55:14] that's why he had the the the courage to
[55:16] fight the uh
[55:18] bear basketball
[55:22] because he knew the blessing that was uh
[55:25] laid upon the tribe of judah
[55:29] and what samuel had already done for him
[55:42] when they say that one of them was
[55:43] supposed to die between the two of them
[55:49] david he didn't even bother him the
[55:51] battle against goliath
[55:56] he didn't watch or he didn't care about
[55:58] the training of goliath
[56:02] david didn't look at the the shields and
[56:05] the the the weapons of goliath
[56:11] david was looking at the blessing of the
[56:13] father
[56:39] i come to fight you on the basis of my
[56:42] faith
[56:51] david didn't know what kind of weapon he
[56:53] would use
[56:55] just by inspiration
[56:58] i just want you to imagine a little
[57:00] young child
[57:02] he's going to fight a warrior
[57:06] he comes and he picks up five dollar
[57:08] stones
[57:10] with this
[57:20] that all the philistines could mark the
[57:22] army of israel
[57:40] and no one encouraged david to go and
[57:42] fight goliath
[57:45] but it's david who knew his position
[57:50] is david who knew his blessing the devil
[58:06] one of my young brothers our fourth is
[58:10] unfortunately they
[58:12] landed jack
[58:13] david there was a a son of a deacon his
[58:16] name was david
[58:18] he was seven years old
[58:21] [Music]
[58:23] he was a very interesting young man i
[58:25] would talk to him
[58:29] and one one day i asked him a question
[58:31] david i said your name is david david
[58:34] he said david killed the lion
[58:37] he killed the bear
[58:39] he killed goliath
[58:41] and and you what have you done he said
[58:43] he's actually
[58:44] he says i've already killed a a fly
[59:02] that's why he could fight goliath
[59:05] without hesitation
[59:08] and we know that he killed goliath
[59:11] and when he killed goliath
[59:15] the first thing that soul asked
[59:20] whose son is it
[59:23] in other words of what tribe is he
[59:26] is
[59:27] attributed and when they said it was
[59:29] from the tribe of judah like a country
[59:32] some country that when they go back when
[59:34] they went back
[59:37] that the sisters that knew how to see
[59:41] that
[59:42] they started singing how that david
[59:44] killed tens of thousands
[59:46] thousands
[59:47] and sold only thousands
[59:52] and all that saul could see that the
[59:55] kingdom this this young man was going to
[59:57] take the case
[1:00:07] that david as son of judah
[1:00:12] of the tribe of judah
[1:00:15] that is the the power or the the the
[1:00:18] power of the kingdom was given to them
[1:00:20] they contacted
[1:00:23] that's how we started fighting david
[1:00:25] mcconaughey
[1:00:37] regardless of what somebody else is
[1:00:39] trying to do
[1:00:40] generally
[1:01:02] to bring saul's life to an end
[1:01:06] he says oh it's far from the lord
[1:01:22] on the anointing
[1:01:24] but saw him
[1:01:27] he wanted to put his hands on david
[1:01:33] but david had the blessing
[1:01:39] i want you to look at the blessings of a
[1:01:41] mortal person mortal man proverbs are
[1:01:44] completely certified it can it can
[1:01:47] happen in that manner
[1:01:51] and we know from david
[1:01:53] until jesus
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] that the scepter never left judah
[1:02:03] it was it stayed in the tribe of judah
[1:02:06] come israel
[1:02:09] as israel pronounced coming
[1:02:12] as jacob had said it
[1:02:15] but he was a man of flesh
[1:02:19] but our lord jesus cannot repent who's
[1:02:22] our god everybody is our father
[1:02:25] he came in this world as a man
[1:02:28] he walked as a man
[1:02:43] he gave us an example
[1:02:45] but says
[1:03:04] surely
[1:03:05] they ate manna out there
[1:03:10] but they didn't know about it about this
[1:03:13] jeremiah
[1:03:29] but i want to ask you something
[1:03:33] have you ever come into that place in in
[1:03:36] a place in your life
[1:03:41] plus
[1:03:46] where christ means more to you than all
[1:03:49] the arguing you could do
[1:03:52] about your church ask chris
[1:03:58] has christ meant more to you than the
[1:04:01] whole world
[1:04:06] i don't mean from an emotional or mortal
[1:04:09] or a mental workout
[1:04:15] i mean from the depths of your heart
[1:04:21] that's something
[1:04:23] that's settled in there montranco
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:40] but you are hidden away and your whole
[1:04:42] motive
[1:04:43] is to serve jesus christ
[1:04:48] if you if you if you entered that place
[1:04:57] have you come into the place where you
[1:04:59] don't care what anybody's what anyone
[1:05:02] says
[1:05:11] not go out and act smart
[1:05:14] but still
[1:05:15] but till the love of god is so anchored
[1:05:19] in you
[1:05:20] that you can't you can't see nothing
[1:05:22] else
[1:05:26] your whole motive is to do the will of
[1:05:29] god
[1:05:31] love everybody
[1:05:34] flowing free from everywhere galileo
[1:05:38] what a place to live
[1:05:41] that's the hidden place
[1:05:45] that's the place where
[1:05:47] we got to come to
[1:05:48] said
[1:06:02] where god does the placing and the
[1:06:05] calling
[1:06:07] you get what i mean
[1:06:11] and that's that's that's what was the
[1:06:13] life of christ
[1:06:15] the business of the father
[1:06:30] he shot the complexity of what he was
[1:06:32] about to do
[1:06:35] he says if it was about me
[1:06:38] i won't do it but
[1:06:40] but all nevertheless
[1:06:43] that your will be
[1:06:45] jesus
[1:06:47] jesus walk by giving us an example
[1:06:50] evel
[1:06:52] and at the end of his life
[1:06:55] he did as israel
[1:06:58] he did as jacob did john
[1:07:01] john chapter 14
[1:07:03] verse 17
[1:07:06] he prayed for us
[1:07:10] when we read john john chapter 17
[1:07:17] we could see the very same thing that
[1:07:20] israel was telling to his children
[1:07:25] when jesus began to pray for us
[1:07:30] he wants he says he wanted to see us
[1:07:33] united
[1:07:36] knew this
[1:07:38] that he wanted that way he was that we
[1:07:40] can also be there
[1:07:43] that as it was
[1:07:46] that we may be the same
[1:07:49] cause
[1:07:50] that what he did
[1:07:53] that we also do it
[1:07:58] he says he's not praying that he may
[1:08:00] take us out of the world may preach
[1:08:04] on the thunder mode but he prayed that
[1:08:06] us being in the world
[1:08:32] and each one of us can take it as his
[1:08:35] personal blessing that god has said this
[1:08:38] circle jacob if jack or what jacob did
[1:08:41] you better complete a letter it could
[1:08:43] come and pass at the letter accomplished
[1:08:46] at the letter
[1:08:48] how much more
[1:09:04] when he went to the cross
[1:09:08] he says they are complete all
[1:09:10] it is all finished
[1:09:12] do they accomplish it's finished
[1:09:18] according
[1:09:20] and that means he is giving us all
[1:09:23] manner of blessings said the kingdoms
[1:09:25] are called access to sociability it
[1:09:28] means it's giving us access to all
[1:09:31] manner of blessings
[1:09:34] now we read that the children of israel
[1:09:36] were eating manner
[1:09:39] but they didn't know what what it was
[1:09:43] and in the old testament
[1:09:48] was what was referred to as the hidden
[1:09:50] manner in the holy of holies
[1:09:54] that only the high priest could get in
[1:09:57] lesotho
[1:10:00] all the rest of them never had access to
[1:10:02] that place because
[1:10:05] but when jesus cried out at the cross
[1:10:10] the bible tells us that the the veil of
[1:10:13] the temple was ranked into
[1:10:16] access to tell us that where we didn't
[1:10:19] have access
[1:10:21] to the things that we didn't have access
[1:10:23] to
[1:10:26] that we can liberally access them now
[1:10:32] that we now all have access to the holy
[1:10:34] of holies
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:37] it's no longer about the priest himself
[1:10:42] and it's not just about the preacher
[1:10:44] himself
[1:10:47] but it's about every son and daughter of
[1:10:49] god
[1:10:53] that god has given every son and the
[1:10:55] daughter of god
[1:10:59] that the preacher does not have more
[1:11:01] blessings
[1:11:04] than a drunk man who just believed
[1:11:06] tonight you don't do this
[1:11:10] that they all have access to the same
[1:11:12] blessings these are two seconds
[1:11:15] but they have the same access to the
[1:11:17] same privilege
[1:11:22] that there was a powerful preacher
[1:11:33] he came and he find himself next to one
[1:11:35] of his
[1:11:36] servants
[1:11:37] a sister from his church one of his
[1:11:39] followers
[1:11:41] and before them there were two crowns
[1:11:47] there was one that was big and shiny
[1:11:49] that was in front of him
[1:11:52] and there was another one that was a
[1:11:53] little small next to it
[1:11:58] they asked the preacher to come forward
[1:12:00] and come and take the crown he said he
[1:12:02] could tell us about me and he said
[1:12:04] certainly that's my believer
[1:12:19] it says no that crown is not yours it's
[1:12:21] a return he looks aside it is a pokey he
[1:12:24] says it's for who what is the pull
[1:12:25] ourselves it says it's for the sister
[1:12:27] you know i said to him
[1:12:28] he said buddy she was my believers
[1:12:31] i'm the one who brought her to christ
[1:12:35] it says yes it was your uh uh
[1:12:37] your sheep and it's you
[1:12:39] are very successful but when you had
[1:12:42] success in your meetings
[1:12:45] it's because that sister was praying for
[1:12:47] you no success
[1:12:59] that this crown is due to punish a
[1:13:02] second it's to say that every single one
[1:13:05] of us before the lord
[1:13:09] has the right and the access to all the
[1:13:12] blessings
[1:13:16] and we come into that by faith
[1:13:18] david like david david
[1:13:21] david had nothing mila vela
[1:13:23] he had the faith
[1:13:28] that god promised that the scepter will
[1:13:31] be in judah
[1:13:36] that god who spoke to the mouth of his
[1:13:38] prophet samuel that he will be king
[1:13:43] i'm not gonna die until
[1:13:52] that i am never going to die unless i
[1:13:54] have access to the blessings that do me
[1:13:58] my regardless of how how uh tired or
[1:14:02] weak i am see don't set the parallel if
[1:14:05] in this bible then benediction
[1:14:07] there is a blessings that's reserved to
[1:14:09] me
[1:14:11] and i believe that it belongs to me
[1:14:14] i am going to go forward like david who
[1:14:17] posted that ability so i may possess
[1:14:19] that blessing
[1:14:22] because it belongs to me
[1:14:26] i heard speak
[1:14:43] he says because it's written on the
[1:14:44] cover he said the holy bible it's the
[1:14:46] holy bible
[1:14:49] and that i believe
[1:14:52] it looks like a permissible religion so
[1:14:54] every promise in the book
[1:14:56] promise
[1:14:58] every promise in the word
[1:15:02] he possessed that by faith
[1:15:07] in
[1:15:08] the sixth sense
[1:15:10] faith
[1:15:11] faith is the sixth sense
[1:15:13] paragraph 55
[1:15:15] he says
[1:15:17] he says now
[1:15:21] i'm not going to use the line of
[1:15:22] discernment
[1:15:24] it was at the end of service
[1:15:28] and sometimes but random will use the
[1:15:29] discernment
[1:15:32] and oftentimes it will increase the
[1:15:34] faith of the people it
[1:15:37] it is i'm not going to use the line of
[1:15:39] discernment
[1:15:43] i couldn't get 50 through it
[1:15:47] it says i couldn't do it
[1:15:49] but i'm going to pray
[1:15:51] no it says now
[1:15:55] if god still remains god
[1:15:59] if god is still god allah is put to fair
[1:16:03] exactly then here can do oh then he can
[1:16:08] do all things
[1:16:10] formula
[1:16:12] just the way he he says what's the
[1:16:14] highest form of faith
[1:16:17] there was a roman
[1:16:18] there was a roman one
[1:16:22] a jew said
[1:16:27] come lay your hands on my daughters
[1:16:31] that's what the jew said
[1:16:45] i'm not worthy
[1:16:49] just say the word
[1:16:54] that's what the gentiles are supposed to
[1:16:56] do this solomon empowered just say the
[1:16:59] word
[1:17:07] and sometimes we think before god can do
[1:17:09] anything people can do that
[1:17:11] but we have to have our people here lay
[1:17:13] hands on us
[1:17:17] you know in africa sometimes it's it's
[1:17:19] it's a little complicated
[1:17:21] the the the uh placing laying on hands
[1:17:24] spiritually it's not spiritual
[1:17:27] oh
[1:17:46] [Music]
[1:17:56] it's the highest form of faith
[1:18:00] when the word is pronounced
[1:18:03] destiny you know it's for you
[1:18:07] you know it's yours
[1:18:10] just
[1:18:20] and you take that word like david took
[1:18:22] his word it's a fourth of it and you go
[1:18:24] forward with it
[1:18:26] he says
[1:18:29] it says in the meetings across the city
[1:18:32] in different places
[1:18:37] they can see one supernatural thing take
[1:18:39] place
[1:18:42] the whole audience will just walk out by
[1:18:45] faith
[1:18:47] see they'll believe it
[1:18:49] but here
[1:18:50] it's so hard
[1:19:05] it says there was a captain they don't
[1:19:08] want to navigate that they were
[1:19:09] navigating
[1:19:11] that he got sick
[1:19:14] he was very sick
[1:19:17] he thought he was going to die
[1:19:22] he asked if there was anybody with the
[1:19:24] bible
[1:19:27] that if someone could read a scripture
[1:19:29] to comfort him
[1:19:34] someone read the scripture to just
[1:19:35] increase his faith
[1:19:39] they said there was a young boy who
[1:19:40] brought him a bible
[1:19:43] he read him isaiah
[1:19:49] it says there was no
[1:19:50] beauty on him to be desired
[1:19:55] but yet it was for our sins and our
[1:19:57] trespasses that it was that he brought
[1:19:59] upon himself
[1:20:02] it says it's by his stripes that we are
[1:20:04] healed
[1:20:08] he said to the captain
[1:20:10] that's what the bible says
[1:20:13] but i'll read you the bible
[1:20:17] like my mom showed me how to read
[1:20:20] like the way they said
[1:20:23] that by his stripes
[1:20:26] we were healed
[1:20:29] that you replace that with your name
[1:20:44] if they said the blessings was for paul
[1:20:46] i am paula that person
[1:20:49] if the blessing says it was for timothy
[1:20:57] if the blessing was for esther
[1:21:00] i am esther at that time
[1:21:05] because every promise is mine
[1:21:11] and when jesus went on the cross before
[1:21:13] whatever i complained to black piazza
[1:21:15] but says he he he he brought forth a a a
[1:21:19] double uh expedition
[1:21:24] it was first for the salvation of our
[1:21:26] souls
[1:21:29] and also for the healing of our bodies
[1:21:34] it was to bring us back to our place
[1:21:40] is to bring us back into our tarot deed
[1:21:48] to bring us to a place where we can
[1:21:50] recognize our place of blessings
[1:21:54] because
[1:22:09] regardless of what the enemy is going to
[1:22:11] come say
[1:22:14] regardless of what goliath is going to
[1:22:17] come before you
[1:22:19] we are never going to tremble
[1:22:22] we have
[1:22:39] it says and when a man's when a man has
[1:22:41] said that he believes the word on street
[1:22:44] scholar sentence
[1:22:46] and then when the holy ghost or the holy
[1:22:48] spirit comes selected
[1:22:52] it's the abstract to the title
[1:22:58] and that gives you permission
[1:23:01] for diversity
[1:23:03] when you have the abstract allo
[1:23:09] that very bit of that belongs to you
[1:23:14] and everything
[1:23:16] everything is on
[1:23:17] it
[1:23:32] there is no exception in a particular
[1:23:35] level there's not a place that's taken
[1:23:38] out
[1:23:39] but everything that's in it
[1:23:42] all the blessings
[1:23:46] belongs to me
[1:23:48] amen amen
[1:23:54] and that gives us the abstract
[1:23:59] when the holy ghost comes upon this
[1:24:01] title deed
[1:24:06] that god that god saw back yonder before
[1:24:10] the fourth for the foundation of the
[1:24:12] world a dirty lover and skill and not
[1:24:24] was born through a man and a woman
[1:24:28] and subject to sin
[1:24:30] and guilty of sin
[1:24:33] but when i believe on it
[1:24:36] i received the deed mcconnell
[1:24:40] but when the holy ghost came
[1:25:09] like the little epileptic child that i
[1:25:11] prayed for
[1:25:15] that came through from the grandfathers
[1:25:20] genetics even if it's a genetic disease
[1:25:23] like medicine
[1:25:31] that when your father has this and your
[1:25:33] mother has this
[1:25:35] yeah you have this culturality
[1:25:38] when you have the abstract dude don't
[1:25:40] you are like better discerning somebody
[1:25:42] when you have the blessing of the lord
[1:25:44] enough the limit there is no limit
[1:25:48] elijah parallel

[1:26:35] i gave it to you
[1:26:37] it's already done two seconds of
[1:26:40] ourselves all that we have to do
[1:26:43] is to come forth
[1:26:46] and by faith
[1:26:50] claim those blessings but
[1:26:52] there's our faith because christ has
[1:26:53] already done it
[1:26:55] it's already accomplished
[1:26:58] but it's for us to come forth
[1:27:01] he says
[1:27:21] but when the abstract had cut has come
[1:27:24] eli fussy is struck off
[1:27:28] abstraction
[1:27:30] omitted everything
[1:27:35] i'm an abstract holder then
[1:27:37] amen

[1:27:45] christ from the dead gently to the
[1:27:47] appropriate and contestable i have an
[1:27:50] abstract deed that's not part of your

[1:28:01] self-changing partners are causing my
[1:28:04] sister you are part of that body
[1:28:07] it's christ who said it
[1:28:09] it's not me
[1:28:12] my words
[1:28:17] as sure as the words of jacob could come
[1:28:20] to pass
[1:28:22] if you can come by faith
[1:28:26] the word of jesus will come to pass for
[1:28:28] you
[1:28:29] there's no limit
[1:28:34] he says
[1:28:46] it says i have an abstract deed that i'm
[1:28:48] part of that body palette contest with
[1:28:51] the abstract
[1:28:53] the sentence freaky fair completely
[1:28:56] with the abstract of the holy ghost
[1:28:59] making that body making that body of the
[1:29:02] word exactly

[1:29:30] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:29:33] and the holy ghost says come come
[1:29:36] contestable
[1:30:01] what are you scared about
[1:30:18] and i'm alive again
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:33] nothing
[1:30:36] even death
[1:30:39] and going to hurt you
[1:30:44] don't worry about it
[1:30:46] benediction
[1:30:55] if you could come
[1:30:57] by faith and come to it
[1:30:59] god will bring it to pass it says even
[1:31:03] death
[1:31:05] it says
[1:31:06] it ain't going to hurt you
[1:31:10] it's so let's go right quick now
[1:31:13] let's go
[1:31:27] the abstract
[1:31:29] the communication we are too it's it's
[1:31:32] like a house that has everything
[1:31:34] it treated his atp
[1:31:37] and everything has been paid for do you
[1:31:39] think that warfare all that we have to
[1:31:41] do
[1:31:42] is to get in if the points you don't
[1:31:45] have and take what we have need of
[1:31:47] by faith
[1:31:52] and that depends upon our faith mother
[1:31:54] continues to act they told me a story
[1:32:01] the thief
[1:32:07] they had to go and give food to a
[1:32:09] certain group of people a
[1:32:13] that everything had to bring in the
[1:32:15] container
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] that the one who brought the smaller
[1:32:21] container
[1:32:23] they will fill up his container
[1:32:26] and the one who brings the biggest
[1:32:28] container
[1:32:29] they're going to fill up his container
[1:32:33] the principle was they were going to
[1:32:35] fill up whatever you brought
[1:32:38] no to jewel about
[1:32:54] it depends on the faith that you are
[1:32:56] bringing forth
[1:33:00] he says that all the blessings in the
[1:33:01] book is yours
[1:33:04] he said that
[1:33:06] and he's able
[1:33:23] everything against it has been struck
[1:33:26] off
[1:33:28] glory
[1:33:32] i may act silly
[1:33:49] contestable co and abs an abstract deed

[1:37:32] when i believed the message
[1:37:36] it was one of the people that really
[1:37:37] touched me greatly in the message
[1:37:41] because every time i was with him
[1:37:44] he would give me a testimony will be
[1:37:46] paralyzed
[1:37:47] oh he was always going to talk to me
[1:37:49] about the word
[1:37:54] and every time i i'll pray that every
[1:37:57] time i meet him that i may also have a
[1:37:59] testimony to tell
[1:38:09] i came i went to see him so i can bring
[1:38:11] him back he might regard me from my care
[1:38:13] he looked at me says brother
[1:38:18] you know that i know the word
[1:38:23] it says i i i don't know if there's
[1:38:25] anything you're gonna tell me that i
[1:38:27] don't know
[1:38:31] did you it's it's it's god's fault
[1:38:37] he says brother you know what i'm saying
[1:38:40] that when we go to church
[1:38:42] say come
[1:38:54] it's like going to the airport these
[1:38:56] people that come with you yeah they're
[1:38:58] shocking for yes and there are people
[1:39:00] they are people that come
[1:39:01] and there are those that are traveling

[1:39:18] they pray and god gives them they don't
[1:39:20] consume me

[1:39:26] who's uh the followers one who just come
[1:39:29] through
[1:39:30] our company
