three laptops from us that's all and they stacked all speakers and the computers and everything by the door and they were getting ready to go Christmas shopping but they picked the wrong store and for some reason they just turned around and ran out we lost three little laptops but the Lord really looked after us so we're gonna try to uh make some improvements on our security but you know we got to they the police wanted to know if they wanted us to file charges and have them arrested if we could identify them and uh Matthew said well let us get them saved first so anyway just pray for him you know what I mean I I feel sorry for him you know I mean uh he has no idea the scripture says if they would have known whom it was they would not have crucified him so I I'm sure he didn't have any idea he just thought this was some nominal place but we know it's more than that and really that's the kind of person we want to come in and feel the presence of the Lord and the conviction of the Holy Spirit uh tonight I just felt led on my heart to play a message for us and um it's called the meanest man I know and it was preached the first of January I mean it was preached in January 27 1962. so if you have your phones and you want to look it up and follow along uh we're going to start where brother Bram says I'd like to read a scripture for you Luke I believe it's Luke 7 36 is where we're going to start and and listen to this and this is a this is a a message where brother Branham is going to preach a drama he's going to preach a story but in the story he puts building blocks and nuggets and and things to consider and he points out in this message a lot of things that the church is walking away from and what's attracting them how they're being attracted to this Sensations and they're being attracted to many things and they're leaving the the main thing the love of God shed abroad in their heart by the Holy Spirit they're leaving the main thing behind and I think as we listen to it and we get to the end many of you may have heard this and he begins to talk about the lady that washed his feet I think that it's a real reminder of what the world's looking for the world's not looking for more power more might the world's looking for real pure love and real love has to be attached to the word of God so uh if you you do have that and you can find it on your phone or your tablet uh on my phone it was paragraph 19. um I don't know what yours might be but I'm just waiting if you have a second uh and uh so he's he where he starts he's uh he he just says um he says uh uh I you know you said I'd just like to get what he says uh here he says he says tomorrow he says now tomorrow afternoon the word willing I'll be speaking to you preaching the Lord willing now if you would like to read the text or write it down for this morning for a little simple drama I would like you for you to read Luke 17 36 and so that's where we're going to start and uh some might maybe like to look here you can watch on the board but uh so I think we'll just jump right into the tape of brother random uh is going to read several scriptures so let's just ask a word of prayer and I I don't believe that this is going to return void but I believe it'll bless your life and after all you're hearing the messenger of the age that's pretty good amen so let's pray father we ask you to bless this word tested this evening we've gathered together Lord but most of all we invite the spirit that anointed this preaching to come into our midst father and anoint our hearts and our ears father because I know because it's promised that you would Stand by Your Word father and mother's shame to identify with this message Lord our congregations not ashamed to have the picture of the pillar of fire on our wall we're not ashamed father to have the cloud and the pyramid father we're not ashamed to identify with the only path that leads to the Rapture and the resurrection Lord I know we bear much reproach because people claim that they have you my father they only have the historical image of you that they've created in their own minds father because of divine revelation we know that you are your word and where your word is you are and father we know we're going to hear your word tonight so we ask you to touch our sick to touch our brokenhearted to touch our needy to touch our souls father may we increase spiritually tonight may we receive overcoming power for we ask it in Jesus name amen is just about what time now is it it's 7 25 so uh eight we should be out by about quarter to nine and we won't linger but it's about an hour 20 minutes enjoy and I know you will as we listen to the meanest man I know God bless you Lord willing now if you'd like to read the text or write it down for this morning for a little simple drama I would like for you to read Saint Luke 7 36. and one of the Pharisees desire him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat very simple we're all acquainted with the story I believe that it must have been about Sundown when The Courier arrived he was tired his feet were Dusty as hair was matted together with dust and perspiration because he had run most of the day he had a a duty to perform and he had to hurry and do it so he'd probably went into Capernaum and they told him in Capernaum yes uh he was here a few days ago but he's gone then he went into Nazareth and so forth a city after City finally long about late in the afternoon the sun setting tired feet soar weary he finally had met the one that he was searching for Jesus of Nazareth or if we could only be like that run City to city place to place until finally we're in his presence it must have been Phillip Phillip was kind of the outside guard seemingly they met him first before they got into the other Apostles say like Jesus setting somewhere and there was John leaning on his bosom Peter representing faith and love was closeness to Jesus so Philip probably brought this Courier to uh to let's say Peter Peter brought him on into the presence of Jesus and he was tired he'd been preaching all day and perhaps his voice honey husky husk with the soreness and dust from the day of the people tramping on the ground and the dust coming up his strength depleted as he must have stood and talked to the people about the word of God looking out upon him and seeing how that they were hungering and thirsting would explain to them how God brought about all of his great works oh I would have loved to have been there to listen to that no doubt I believe that every person here would a long to be there do you hear what he had to say listen to his Doctrine what his Doctrine was how he expressed himself and what type of a voice he had look upon his face and the scene performing his works and Discerning the thoughts of the people and telling them of different things and diseases they had and pronouncing them heal I would have loved to have been there oh my I would like to see that and perhaps maybe he just got through with the sermon of you know Jesus first Doctrine did you ever know what it was you must be born again that was his first Doctrine you must be born again so he might have went back to Genesis and began and said in the beginning God said let there be and there was and he said let everything that I have spoken bring forth of its kind and it did then he might have brought something like this saying well now that it brings forth but yet you can take these seeds and you can mix them together and you can get what's called a hybrid product beautiful very nice but it isn't the original you let it go it'll go back to its kind again and a hybrid product can never stand the roughness in the treatment that the original can stand one old long-horned star of one of your herpes to death out on the prayer in the wintertime she can make her own way like a deer but you're hybrid Hereford your hybrid dreaming this you die out there you have to bathe him and he if he was standing today I believe he'd say something like it to us not only have we hybrided fruit animals but with hybrid religion has to be babied and petted it's not the original we try to take uh the word of God and breed it into something else breathe it all over here and it becomes a bunch of delicate babies that we have to babies they can't take the real world he might have been saying something like that then he might have said you see really your lives are hybrid father said don't touch the tree but Satan said it won't hurt you so therefore your life now is in a hybrid condition and that life cannot go back to itself because read that fact you can take the donkey and breed it to the horse and the mayor it'll produce some you but the mule the mother mule and father mule cannot have a baby mule you have to keep hybrid same thing with corn it's beautiful but your red Readers Digest what all these hybrid things are doing to the people hybrid chickens they say that in 20 years if it isn't stopped what will happen women cannot have babies no more they're becoming stronger at closing up smaller in the hips can't have the baby leave things the way they are let God alone that's where this word leave it like it is don't try to add something to it to fit a Creed keep it just the way God said it believe it that'll make a husky strong Christian not a baby that has to be the nominational baby patted around letter from church one denomination to another when he puts his name on the book in heaven it's settled forever Jesus might have said now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you New Birth your old life is gone in your back to the original word of the law you're not your hybrid into churches denominations but when God speaks gives peace and the Holy Spirit then you're back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it go to the Cross to the fiery furnace to the Lion's Den or wherever it may be because the word of the living God's burning in your heart and soul they all can backslide all can turn against you and everything else but that won't stop one thing that rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart you are mine I suppose maybe on something like that I don't know but he might have been speaking and his voice is horse his lips parched his face read from the direct rays of the Palestinian sun which is very hot and then maybe Philip and Peter waiting till he finished and then maybe he said this at the last see and you shall find and by the time he finished that Peter might have said Lord here is a man that's been sent from a certain place by a certain man and he wishes to speak with you and he's looked down at him and said say on never too tired but what he's ready to listen to anything you want to say he's the same today no matter how late it is tonight how weary he might be he's still ready to answer anything question that you'll ask him and he said this Courier perhaps thought this is a time that his journey was over so he said to him a certain certain Cardinal Bishop something Pharisee my master is going to have a great feast and he's honored you because my master is a great man and he's honored you seeing the crowd that's around you the Lord see the way you're dressed and yet he wants you to come and visit him at this Feast it's such and such a Time Jesus always goes where he's invited no matter where it's at you'll come or he come to a lion's den one time to fiery furnace I believe it was David said I'll make my bed in hell he'll be there you come to the poorest to the richest to the most immoral to the meanest to the lowest you'll come anywhere he's invited no matter what your conditions and position in life is he'll still come that makes him crowd to me humble I'll be there go tell your master I'll be there at that such and such a date I'll be there that most miserable Courier how could he have done it I wish I could have had his place turn this back upon the Lord and run away with a satisfied feeling that he had pleased his master so many times we're guilty of that we're so interested I was reading in the um Nicene fathers of post-nicine council they were Saint Augustine of Hippo setting with Saint Martin one day as he's visiting at the monastery out in the backyard in the garden God gave him the opportunity to receive the Holy Ghost like Martin did but he turned it away so interested in the the dogmas of Rome till he couldn't receive the Holy Spirit many times we get that way so interested in other things sometimes we're so interested in time that we are brought right into the presence of the Lord Jesus walk away a man interested me the other night on the platform when he was speaking about going to one of the conventions and taking his whiskey and cigars that's all he known about a convention but I'm glad that he accepted the opportunity so many times we don't do that accept the opportunity this Courier delivering the message and in the presence of the Lord Jesus and yet but the stupid enough if I must say it to turn away and think that he had did all that was necessary sometimes we go to school and get a PhD or lld go into a Pentecostal meeting and they're telling that the days of Miracles has passed because the bishop sent us to tell him so and turn away from the very fact that we're in the presence of Jesus Christ what an opportunity God gave that man that poor miserable man I wish I could have stood there I'd have fell down at his feet the first thing before I said anything about what the Cardinal wanted I said Lord Jesus be merciful to me a sinner that had been the first thing in my life knowing that he was life in the only resource the God was through him I would accepted him let him be my personal savior person let the mission that the Cardinal had give me are the pope for district man or whatever he was that'd give me a mission out of salt Christ first I think that ought to be the sole Duty of every man woman that can't sees meetings regardless of what somebody else said you've been brought into the presence of Christ no matter how successful or unsuccessful no matter how great or how poor no matter what you are not the first opportunity fall at his feet and say Lord be merciful to me then come tell the businessman you'd like to like them in the rain put God first this most miserable man how we would look at him this morning if we could pull back the curtain and see if that was continually his attitude to turn from the presence of Christ when he had the opportunity to stand by him what a miserable person that is yet today because he lives somewhere and it might be you and I after this meeting today it depends on our attitude when we're in his presence always accepted but he turned his back upon the Lord and walked away feeling relief satisfied that he had done what he was told to do sometimes it's not good to do what you're told to do in that case it was right so then we find out that he must have hurried back and brought the commission and I found him I know who he is I met him and I told him and I've got his promise that he'll be here you'll be here he said he would be here now there's something wrong with this scene there's something wrong somewhere those Pharisees didn't like Jesus they hated him they couldn't find his name on their denominational role they could find none of their schools of theology he had come through but he come through not theirs gods so we find out that these Pharisees hated him he had no cooperation with them they despised him and you cannot come together for Fellowship unless you've got something in common that's the reason we love to come to these meetings we've got something in common the Holy Spirit brotherly love fellowshipping one with another while the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses all of our sins we have Fellowship we have something in common when you see uh young people with old people you see a little girl hanging around Grandma all the time something wrong too much difference in their age you know all the young women they're 16 years old they like to pop their chewing gum and you know and things like the others and talk about the boy friends and uh and the old ladies they like to talk about stitching and cutting and sewing and cooking and so forth and the little kids like to to play dolls or Marvel's tops or want more but when you see a little bitty girl hanging around with Grandma you just imagine Grandma's got a sack of candy somewhere something wrong or she's Grandma's pet so this Pharisee must have had a is we've caught it on the street a trunk card up his sleeve to invite Jesus cause he hated him for a little Fellowship I just imagine he said to the other great man in his neighborhood you know that so-called prophet our people knows that it's telepathy we know that he's a fortune teller there's nothing to him you know all of them didn't die a lot of them still live we know that they we don't believe in our our association is done denounced it so you know what at this certain Feast that I'm going to have I'm going to see if I can get him down here and we'll prove that he's not we'll prove that he's not what he says he is so we'll get him down here and that to my opinion was the card he held in his sleep all these Pharisees there's only two classes of people man rich and poor so they they could really put on a feast oh my how they could do it they'd pick select the most suitable time of the year maybe when the grapes is all ripe around in The Vineyards I'm the night blooming Jasmine the orange blossoms that it feel the air and just made the valley full of the fragrance of the other order and then they would take and roast the lamb oh delicacy roast that lemon and the poor people smell it down into town their mouth of water but the smell that lamb roasting but you can only count by invitation they had their yards all fenced in and so forth and they'd probably get out in the great patio on the back and it was a real selected time for their so-called Fellowship that these priests and hierarchies had together and they just invited the celebrity so you see Jesus would be out of place there anybody filled with the spirit would be out of place there so they they had all their discussions of other things and that's one thing I like about a businessman's meeting not only a businessman but a for this set and talk about how they can uh get a little on this side and cut off a little from this one and rob peter to Faith Paul they say you know and such things I like it where you come and you talk about Jesus and about God about the Holy Ghost and about the power and the resurrection and the coming of the Lord that's what I like in the businessman but this fella he was a different sort of a character Annie had he got everything ready the selected it no dots sent word around to all the hard priests and the Bishops and so forth now he's coming down be here now we'll just certainly one time for all prove that there's nothing to this guy you all come down you've never seen him and uh we don't expect maybe something that we can catch him in so finally everything was put in order the right day come for the the feast and the ER that morning everything was set in order everything ready at all how they could get it ready everything just touched that morning real early all the services up with the towels over their arms that was going to serve the Beast had already been killed in was being barbecued in the front yard and the wines was all set in this special bottles and jugs and goblets is on the table everywhere and all the servants was ready to serve the crowds that come Transportation was a very odd thing they had three ways of transportation the Army come in a chariot the rich man came on a new the four wall so they had different ones out there to take care of the guests as they come up it was really set up real nice now let's keep our minds closed and as we see that perhaps maybe the man that was going to take care of the soldiers chariots the team they they had a place to take care of their uh unhook their horses and put them in the staple and give them food and the one for the rich to take their little donkey out and fix salmon and then they had another fella there he was called the footwash he was a flunky the lowest paid man of all the group of flunking footwash Lloyd's job of all and sometimes when we think that we're somebody in the highest hierarchy of Heaven became flesh in a foot wash punky when it comes to wash Marlo's feet when it comes to the Earth he didn't come to be a big somebody God always takes the the nobodies to make somebody out of them that's a trouble with the people today they're trying to be a somebody you want to become a nobody God takes something too to make something out of it and it proves that he's God how that this low job to wash the feet of the people and Jesus taking that job the Lord said there was on the earth to become a an example he didn't have to do that he could reach an officious mouth and pull out a corner or speak to the mountains in a poor Gold by the billions of tons you can pump water out of a well and turn it into the most delicious wine in the country he could take uh five biscuits and two fish and fed five thousand he didn't have to do it but he come for an example the way Pentecostal people should be duck the lowest job sure that's what but we try to take the biggest we can't beat Bishop Dr Pepper or something highest places biggest things the whole mile we're just we're full of big things I don't come when I'm invited like this the baby and Pet People I pray thank God that's your people what can I say I see the things creeping up then the Holy Spirit begins to tell me strike at this see we want something big God takes something little Elijah heard the mighty Russian wind the Thunders Lightnings and the earthquake and never bothered him but what attracted him was a still small voice that made the prophet put something over his face and walked forth to hear God wonder if we Pentecostal people hasn't relied too much on rushing wind a lot of noise instead of remembering or hearing that still Small Voice we hear so much Rumble we can't take time to hear the still small boy praise the Lord you know the wagon goes out in the field runs over humps and bumpity bumpity bumpity making all kinds of noise squeaking and squawking and jumping but coming back it's loaded down with good things it passes the same bumps and don't make a move we all have all of it as long as there's malice Among Us as long as there's differences among us we're not yet loaded take a weed lightheaded a wheat comes up holds itself up in the air shakes by the wind sticks his head straight up but when it becomes full-headed it down I think that's what's the matter with all of us today the churches we don't associate ourselves enough and real humility not a false but something that you stay there until Something's Happened to you humility too much wind and Thunder not enough still small voices I think that is true we look and see that it's true because the fruit that it bears Upon Our People somehow it isn't just like it used to be back to your story we'll get that Sunday notice we find these Pharisees this Pharisee making everything ready for his big uh blow out as we'd call it big spread that he's going to put on ah look at the the man out there ready to take the soldiers chariots and the one taking the rich man's donkey and in Palestine they wear a garment on the outside which is a robe on the inside they were underneath garment that comes to the knees and as they travel in those days they walked up over the mountains and and across making shortcuts and when they did the the Walkers and the one who had beasts a burden they walked the same path and the Beast along the road where they've walked and and then laying upon the ground uh the dust begin to accumulate and where the Beast that cross the land there was a smell in the dust and as the people walk and this big garment swinging loose caused a wind and it picked up the dust and it got on their limbs on their face and they wasn't presentable to uh entertain uh if they were smelling like that so they had a foot wash flunking that would meet the guest at the door and when anyone come up with their card of invitation he had a whole rack um what we would call something like bedroom shoes made out of textile or or some kind of a good and the sandals of those days were sometimes a piece of wood like we have they're called the Roman sandal with a piece of leather that the toll went between the foot was exposed then to the to the Dust and as they tread along they'd come to this place give their honor their ticket and they would reach down take off these sandals and set them up in a place with their name and leech up on The Mantel and get a another pair of soft sandals and put on their feet which they were ready then to go in all their rugs are sometime were real thick and great tapestries they were had a beautiful play in their homes those people were rich and then the next thing this person did he was washed his feet then the next thing happened he went to the next guest and he was standing with a towel over his arm with a little Cruise in his hand then he he would pour oil in his hand let him rub it behind his ears and on his neck because his face was burning he was dirty and he'd take this towel and wipe his face off good and he was all right the smell was off of him and he was anointed with perfume and that was costly very costly they get it they tell me from way up in the mountains where they get these little apples after the rose has gone in the little apples and it's a very costly thing like the Queen of Sheba brought up to Solomon spices and stickered and so forth and they made this perfume out of it and they relaxed themselves by they were feet was washed the smell was off of them that burning blistering Sun up on their face then they refresh then the next thing the first step second step now the third step now I could preach on that a while but uh I haven't got the time how this justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost then when they went in they met the guests met there was met by the The Host then something like this stand up for the demon after you see washed perfumed he did he wasn't embarrassed of the smell you know soft shoes to walk on the big Persian rugs he was anointed he had a good smell on him not the stink of the animals but he was perfume then they reached like this come right here brother Jesus I've been in the ordering and I take this hand like this then they come this way together then they patted one another when the host met the gas then that was called the welcoming see it didn't wash perfumed and was kissed welcome they kissed on the neck he was kissed welcome that he was a full-fledged brother that's the way it is in the church when we're washed foreign [Music] then we're welcome yes all this so much to be said there but to keep you not too long I don't want to Tire you but when then kiss welcomed me if he's at home he didn't have to worry about nothing he'd go over it's a refrigerator get a big sandwich and kick off his shoes lay down on the bed anything you want to do he was at home and when God kisses us welcome into his kingdom we're home it's all right it's all over them we've been washed by the preparation that he prepared for us his blood a sweet smelling savior perfume by the sanctification that drives the stink of the world Hallelujah I feel kind of religious right now taking away the stink of the wild are the desires of the world see if the world's still in the Sin there's something wrong no wonder we can't have a real private class for Revival oh why are there something missing the guest hasn't exactly entered right you see Jesus taught that one time about the robes and he said this man was down there not prepared and he was bound and casting out of Darkness so much could be said on him but that's the way they did it and they were home they felt like they were a brother you can't feel like your brother when you still desire the world you can't associate yourself out you're in things of the world of cheating lying stealing you women bobbing off your hair and wearing shorts and everything then still feel at home when the word of God's been preached you're supposed to be Pentecostals supposed to be filled with the Holy Ghost someone hit at me not long ago said won't you leave them people alone said people think you're a prophet I said I'm no prophet say well they think you are why don't you teach them people them Pentecostals how to receive these things how to get great spiritual blessings and Eatery into the presence of God and see Visions also if you leave them alone I said how can I teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABCs how can they accept spiritual things when they won't even have the common decency between themselves up not to hurt you but to be honest with you on honorable things that the Bible says that you shouldn't do yeah we associate with it sure see you can't be welcome no sir you're out of place with the word and he is the word now so much for that we'll get that some other time but notice on as we go say what's America well you man that'll let him do it that shows what you're made out of some of you women pastors wives act like that and dress like that what is it your time your husband lets you do it oh brother what is it some of these water head haircuts you have kind of act like the first lady of the land Jazzy Bell was the first lady of the land too [Applause] some of their pastors wouldn't tell them about it but they had Elijah down there stood out on it all right that was her pastor she didn't want to believe it lettering notice we find out that they had to be ready and prepared to go in how did it happen we see him now sitting in the room unwashed unanointed not just welcome sitting in the Cardinal's house I want to ask you something what happened to that football slumpty where was he at how did he bow face it what an opportunity and missed it oh I believe if I'd been there and noticed coming I've been on a step ladder somewhere watching for him to come the honor of washing his feet the honor but somehow he just bypassed him let him go or was the man within awning oil but somehow he was there and was dirty kills me to say it say it but Jesus with dirty feet you know the Frenchman calls him Jesus Jesus Jesus nobody caring to up enough about it to wash his feet what's that got to do with us brother Brandon he come and he was on time he's always on time never late we call for our Revival and he comes somebody starts to praise the Lord are we just put out of the church he's never welcomed Jesus with dirty feet oh why did he get dirty he got dirty coming because he was called to come and today is also when he comes he's called Holy Roller some Scandal name why did he take that sort of a thing because we invited him to come and God came down in the form of human flesh he lives here on Earth he became that soul that we invited God to come and then when he come they don't want him they didn't want him many times we don't want him it interferes with our denominational setup that interferes with the social standing we have with the other churches God have mercy on WE poor miserable Pharisees what we need is the power of the Holy Ghost out of the buildings and back into the people that could have the old-fashioned Pentecostal power that cleaned the church from the janitor to the pastor holy man that's what we need but we pray for it and when it comes oh no that interferes with my social standing oh sure cuts down some of the dignity if you don't have it just so and so the people won't come Jesus said no man can come to me except my father droughty notice again all that the father give me will come keep the grain clean we can't never compare with the world we're doing wrong but trying to act like the world we never can compare with them and we've got no business out on their grounds bring them over on our grounds we got something they haven't got it we go to act like them then they know we we're seeing something we haven't got let the let the world come to us not us Squad ain't the world let the world you know Hollywood shines but the gospel glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing him glow not shy with the outward appearance glow me inside by the Holy Ghost with sweetness meekness gentleness patience and love go don't shine science after the world the church is whole like it was in the days of Esther Esther didn't take the perfume in the of the women she adorned himself with a modest a pair of the hidden men of the heart and the King said put the crown on her head Esther was a type of the church today those who are ready to come out and Adorn themselves with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit not the perfume in the dressing of the world try to compare with them but that hidden man of the heart that's the one notice we find Jesus sitting out there with dirty feet they have never been noticed how did he get in how did he miss how did the football splunky missing how the rest of them miss him I don't know but he was sitting there with dirty feet nobody's doing anything about it oh Pharisee in the other the bishop the Archbishop and the Cardinal and all the rest of us over there tipping their goblets together and drinking the the Fine Wines and and talking about the things of the of Israel but fail to see the god of Israel that's today we want the biggest building in the town or and all the people like to flock to the biggest building there is in the city all these big the best dressed and all this other some poor little man preach the gospel down here on the street calling or out there somewhere in the alley in a little church and you don't want to associate with him what's the matter there's something wrong well if there were the rest of the people act like this and dress the best too bad it's sitting in our rooms right what we need is a humbling what we need is a re-baptism of the holy spirit with God's love and power to take this world out of us bring us back to adorning again to the word Washed by the Water of the word get back to Christ instead of fashion ourselves of the world trying to act like the first lady and and all these other things some of the Bishops and so forth no matter about that you want to be like Jesus Jesus not think of it everybody's standing around the fence as the feast got on the fragments of the lamb and everything there wasn't nobody on the street everybody was standing looking in their mouth watering grasping for a bite of the Lamb they couldn't come in no they were the poor the trash outside and here was one on the inside dressed and looked like them on the outside something wrong somewhere sitting there not only the decency to wash his feeder or kiss him welcome just let him sit there nobody around him his disciples couldn't come they wasn't invited but here he's sitting here looking around now listen weighed down the street to the lowest part of the city down in the red light district we turn right grew up an alley there's a little creaking steps coming down the back and as you climb it she squeaks and squeaks open the door and we find in there a little woman I don't believe she meant to be bad maybe she had a good parent and she just took the road that's wrong or maybe she was a good girl some slick-haired curly-headed Judas ruin the little lady's reputation I'm always hit it to women and we'll take up for you wow amen there's a menu good girl gone wrong because of some little perfume Judas run along with his hair slicked down and hold his mouth open in front going on with some little something of the one of these here Ricky or Elvis's machines out here on the street take some little girl out cause she thinks he's cute give her a cigarette get her on the Dance Floor I met thousands of them their poor little lives wrecked in the rooms they always their fault don't ever fall for a boy like that sister let him alone and nothing to him if he ain't filled with the Holy Ghost I'm going to say something I don't mean it for joke cause it's no place for jokes man but if something happened to my church this is a place of the Gospel we had a girl at our church here some time ago nice pretty little girl first thing you know she cut her hair that's against the rule sir when she does that the Bible says she's a dishonorable woman get away from her the Bible said a woman cuts her hairs dishonorable now that's the word God knows that's right if the Holy Ghost is in you and won't cooperate with that what kind of Holy Ghost is that the Holy Spirit itself in you makes you live what you are if the Holy Spirit disagrees with the word that you call it the Holy Spirit then it's not the holy spirit of God you've got some sort of a spirit today we have all kinds of spirits people say shut your eyes open up your mouth receive something you do but look what you got after you receive it don't you do holding on to the word get the spirit of God will make you walk right in line with God sure this little girl she got to run around some little Elvis I try I asked her I said Martha do that what are you seeing that guy smokes I seems down all Church ground smoking oh she says uh brother randomly said you know said he's got pretty curly hair and said you just smell so good now if that ain't something to pick a boyfriend I said but he isn't saved I said I'd rather go with a boy that smelled like a Stockyard head feet like a boxcar and have the Holy Ghost yes I would I'm one of those little things she finally ended up on the wrong road like maybe this poor girl did some boy letter wrong then she started if you've already started since there's hopes if you just meet this man I'm talking about maybe she hadn't had the opportunity so she starts down the street on her regular routine and she sees nobody where's everybody at and she passes another Corner in another corner where is everybody there's nobody today after all she smells that Aroma poor little empty stomach begins to hunger she moves up amongst the crowd up around Pharisees door and she sees the bishop the Cardinals and all of them in there tipping the Goblet and she presses herself up to the fence and people can get away from her I'm worse than she is right shall stop don't realize that every woman went wrong I had some reason to every man that went wrong and we think we're so self-styled many times we don't want to associate with the bums on the street we ain't got time to stop and talk to them a minute and then call ourselves Christians yes she passed your way up to the fence and she was looking around through there she was hungry and she looked and she's watching over here in the corner stood Pharisees she could hear that great big ho ho ho over the corner looked over here he was tipping the goblets of that fine fancy wine and the lamb being roasted and did her almost ready to be served and and looking around like that and after a while her eyes caught somebody oh may we all catch that picture now setting over in the corner unnoticed and she must have caught his eye nobody can ever look him in ah I never feel the same again she saw him he's taught who is that there's something different about him and there is there never was nobody like him there can never be nobody lagging he was different from others there he was sitting she looked down at the people's turn away from me and she noticed his feet was unwashed his face is still parched and burning if we could only see that today you know what I'm talking about seems setting in disgrace like his people to us today to the world they don't want no association with them here same as you say Pentecost brother they're gone you say holy ghost they're away from it what weed people need to do is to wash his feet anointing that we might rise in the power of his resurrection take that disgrace off of you amen make the world ashamed of themselves with the power of His Life in US that's different creatures not like them out there that's cannon fodder that's not about Atomic ashes church is a born-again creature here he was sitting and that kind of the crowd that's the way he looks and that's where a genuine Spirit-filled man or woman looks on the side of such a crowd notice she looked at him she thought you know who that is somebody here is that that prophet of Galilee all that's him oh her heart began to pound something when he finds Jesus your heart goes to acting funny let's go get a new master right away heart went to pounding oh that's the one the one that was down there at the well or that woman of sakar was that's the one that found the woman is in Marla's eye and told her that she had too many husbands and forgave her her sins oh you'd never forgive me I'm too wretched but it's not right that him setting her like that he's a god of Eternity he's the only savior it's not right for him to be treated like that she got an idea I hope you get one down the street she goes just as hard as she can down to the little alley up the alley to the little creaking steps crickety crickety up she goes pulling a little squeaking door open actually takes the lock off goes in falls down on the floor she thinks I'm on Monday she reaches under the bed pulls out a little box and unlocks it and a little piece of her stocking perhaps she takes it out shakes it there's all her living that's all she's got but she's ready to give it I wonder if we are that sincere don't Point your finger to her if you're not All She had she was willing to give it and she pulls it up to her bosom and she her heart's full of joy all of a sudden something's presented to her you know he's a prophet I believe he's a prophet I don't care what Rabbi says what the Cardinal Bishop says I believe that he is the one that Moses spoke of I believe that he's the prophet that was to visit us in these days and him being that he'll know where I got this money he'll know the the means that I did to get this money but it's all I got sure he knows you can tell you're right in this Pulpit right now all about you sir you believe it I can prove it to you hey man excuse me he knows what you're made out of him you know these words sometimes Scorch it knows all about you but it's all she had that's all he expects out of you just give your all to him your old heart will and popularity social standing is thought all on him no matter what you've done but she said this is my only opportunity and I'm going to take it maybe it might be your last opportunity you better take it while you're in this convention don't you go home without it bro I believe you're gonna see him moving in the same way he already is you're going to seem greater than this you go to see his word made manifest notice as she says it's all I got so it's all I can give that's all he expects brother Brandon I'm I'm I don't care what you are not your hypocrite you've been I'll go to church member how self-righteous you may stand this morning before the people just give what you got that's all he expects he'll take that she goes down the street she said well easy I'll go because there's something in me telling me to do it that's when it's real not when you're putting it on but something real here she goes down the street and she looks around and she remember lubinski has the best perfume shop in the city so she enters the door the little bell rings and one raise up look see it was matter what do you want like some of these men before they become Christian businessmen that's poor business what do you want I don't like for a person like that to be in my shop I don't want the best you got oh my the best I got yep it's for uh it's for a real certain person it's for our special occasion that's why we want the best that can be gone the best we can give not just three minutes a day in prayer but the best you can give oh I want the best you got well he knew a woman like that really didn't have money enough to buy that so she takes her little stocking top and said how much is the best 20 pieces that's the best I got she pours her little stocking top out there and the money rattles oh of course that's different he who said there's no prophet in keeping Joseph he's ready to make it you know so he gots up there and counts it out oh yes exactly 20 pieces of Roman denaria that's what it calls what are you going to do with this oh this is for a special person so he reached up on the shelf and gives her the alabaster box puts in her bosom she slips back up again she looks in there she sees Pharisee in them all standing around in such a great uh collaboration of a Pomp and she sees Jesus still sitting there with dirty feet nobody had paid any attention to him how am I going to get in they'll throw me out I want to start in the gate but you know there's something inside of her tell her to go in she wanted to do a service for Jesus and if you're wanting to do a service for Jesus to raise enough Bishops and Cardinals on Earth to stop you from getting me that's right you know enough denominations and hypocrites in the country to do it I have Devils of the hell to stop you from it if you are wanting to do a service for Jesu here she comes she steps around she sees the guard at the gate turned his back she sneaks under the gate here she makes her way real quick that's right when you first get in go right to him don't mess around don't go talk and see what this one says and what this organization says and that says go right straight to Jesus say get to him right quick so she slips up real quick she stands the Bible says behind him she got to thinking oh oh I'm in the presence of God a strange feeling always comes over you when you come in that attitude but if you come into attitude at Pharisee had you'll have the same feeling he had nothing to it or just come in that attitude you want to see Jesus see what kind of feeling comes over you let that old heart melt within you this morning towards you listen to his still smaller voice it'll be a different attitude slips up he was sitting there she thought oh oh I'm so nervous I don't know what to do if I get around maybe he might run me out of here oh what well I'm not I'm nothing anyhow now you get to thinking that you're nothing anyhow if you're afraid you're going to ruin your friends he said you better stay away in a person nothing to begin with so she run around in front of me and she looked then she was closed that's what you want to get just a little closer to look at it maybe you're looking too far away you're looking at him way back down there two thousand years ago was What about him this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever same power same signs the works that I do should you also brother Demus a while ago coordinate in King James greater than this shall you do but the right translation that anyone knows is more than this shall you do not greater no one can do any greater but more of the same great works he raised the dead and stopped nature nothing else could be done any greater but more why he's in his church Universal the great holy Apostolic Pentecostal Catholic Church around the world jizu and every member he's only one man God was there now God's in his whole church right this hour of people's being healed write this very minute people's receiving the Holy Ghost if he was just standing here alone in a man for him as he was then he could only be talking this audience but now he talks the world over and the Holy Ghost so there she was in his presence she moved around I can see those little eyes look up at her and her heart nearly failed there's the men that forgive that woman and load her heart he knew that woman of Samaria soccer we he knew she had five husbands and he knows how guilty I am he does he knows how guilty you are he knows just how low down every one of us are he knows us she looked him in the face and she recognized it now she never looked over Pharisee or looked at the chart and see how many members belonged to the church where she'd join it or not she looked at Jesus she felt guilty and she couldn't hold her tears in his hunger she looked down at his feet and the tears are going to drop off on his feet she was so ashamed she fell down on her knees she used to see her and she couldn't hold her tears any longer or something about when you get around Jesus you start crying not with a cold I ain't got no use for these cold starchy confessions and put your name on the book and giant in the church You Gotta Die to yourself be born to new and the tears begin to drop off on Jesus feet and she didn't have nothing to wipe them with so hanging her head there I'm crying her pretty curls and she had all done up on top of her head you know what I just fell down she began to wash his feet with her hands in and wipe with her her hair some of our Pentecostal sisters Bob know their pretty hair off has stand on their head to get enough hair to wash his feet right but he she even in her condition don't condemn her she took her hair began to wipe his feet she'd look up oh if you'd have moved the foot if she if he would have bad at us should have gone out of there but Jesus when you're trying to do something for him he just lets you do it I love that set still and looked at her and she's trying to say wiping his feet I want a beautiful water towards his feet tears of repentance better than he could have gotten from old Pharisee old self-made denominational Waters he had Waters of repentance her great big Brony tears tracking his feet her with her pretty hair just washed why haven't he said uh I can't say it Jesus wiping his feet it got so weird I can't see it my Jesu just watched her after a while she took the alabaster box out she was ashamed to stand up to put it on his hand sure she thought if I can just sit at his feet that'll be good some of you want to be the big shot but not for me his word is sufficient as long as I know that I'm in him and his word me that's good enough not get over there if I can just pop my hands on his feet that's enough that'll be all right that's all I ask I think that's the way we call it being washing his feet tears of water of repentance that's what he wants his his dirt washed off with pittance not pins repentance washing his feet whitening with her hair directly she reached them nervously she got the alabaster box and she didn't she was so nervous and she broke the end of it poured it all up on his feet his she was real nervous and and then she reached back again her wife is speaking I I wanna she looked up she noticed his eyes is off over there what's going on all the time in the room there's not a move made what's the matter everything stopped oh I can see that felt self-style Pharisee the meanest Rascal in the country always red in the face he's so humiliated somebody said amen why somebody say Amen in his church you're disturbing a little power of God he has to say a word he made mistake somewhere and said Jesus Christ come to say Sinners somebody say glory to God oh ushers put him out yeah they disturb me they disturb me when they don't say it so there he was so humiliated oh come down to oh he was just I have to quit he was so humiliated he's looking at him and he said within himself nod and them Cardinals you see told you if that man was a problem he would know what kind of a woman that well sure he did she has a million times better off than him though he was a church member she was a prostitute shame on you miserable poor church members that knows more about God than that humiliated I said I told you I told you see if he was a prophet he was the prophet he didn't know that he's no prophet but Jesus could discern his thoughts so he raised himself up the little woman stood her hair hanging down her over her shoulders down about her waistline the tear streaks down and grease all over a mouth from kissing his feet great big pretty brown eyes wonder what he's going to say looks down at her he said Simon I got something to talk to you about self-style poor miserable hypocrite profession to be a servant of Christ I got something to say to you you invited me to come here and I come I left my busy schedule he always does right he come here he's here now sure I left my busy schedule because you invited me to come and when I got to the door you didn't wash my feet you didn't anoint my head and you never give me a kiss welcome but this woman ever since she's been here she's done nothing wash my feet with tears and wipe them with her hair she had anointed me now what's he gonna do there she's standing there her big eyes looking up at you what's a Verdi Rod let that be my birdie let that be what I hear when I try to do him a service I have to say things to my people it cuts me to Pieces inside but I got to do him a service it's written in the word I must do it store look at her she was Spellbound what's he gonna do condemn me then he looked and said and I say unto her her sins which remain are all forgiven her sins which were made are all forgiven her that's the verdict I want to hear I want to try through my life to do God's work you want a child the same and the verdict at the end will be the same thing thy sins which are many are all forgiven me let's bow our heads Justin you enjoy that hey man you can go listen to the rest make your own altar call in your heart but I think it's so important that we recognized here that there's an attitude that's presented what it means to be humble what it means to serve other people what it means to be little and what it means to recognize that everything that you have comes from him and and and to serve them and to have that heart and not to get carried away with the things that are unimportant but you know what struck me so much is when he says when we get there our reward is your sins which are many are forgiven we think we're going to get some great big thing but just to be forgiven is good enough for me so Lord bless you and I thought that was needful I thought it's the word there's a lot in there and so we're just going to rest on that this evening and and you can go finish the tape and and listen to it but I just thought there were so many nuggets in there for us tonight so Lord bless you let's stand together this evening um and we just maybe in your heart tonight that there was something within the framework of the word of God that touched you tonight and you would like to invite the spirit to come and Quicken it and make it real in you and make a change in you tonight and you just like to lift your hand to him and and say Lord I was convicted tonight by the the presence of your presence and you standing in your word and Lord I'd like to have a change of attitude I'd like to have a a change of devotion and commitment Lord I just don't feel maybe I've been as dedicated to the word as I've should have been and I'd like that spirit that refilling that brother Branham talked about so what he said he said that's what we need we need a refilling refilling is a renewing of the right attitude the renewing of our priorities a renewing of what we're living for a renewing of what bothers us he said that hybrid is said it's not rugged it can't take every every little thing destroys it it falls to Pieces over everything it's never happy you've always got to be babied Lord I want to have what's real that makes me just rugged that makes me steadfast it makes me strong Lord I like to rededicate myself tonight to you to reset my priorities on having the love of God should have brought in my heart by the Holy Spirit do you just like to take a moment and look up to him this evening and safe Lord make that change Within Me [Music] Lord I don't want to be like somebody that's important I want to be someone little enough to wash Jesus's feet to be in service for you Lord if I never get one ounce of recognition [Music] my life is living to hear those great words well done my servant enter into the joy of the Lord your sins which are many have been forgiven you Lord and I just pray that this is an opportunity this evening for all of us to re-examine our heart re-examine our thinking re-examine what's important and if we become a little prickly and a little grumpy and a little thing that we can sweeten up our spirit with your presence Lord we ask in Jesus name we pray [Music] [Applause] all my works and all my needs and every prayer set on my knees [Music] I want to see is Jesus [Music] I want baby [Music] [Applause] [Music] through me [Music] hurt yourself inflated pain and everything that
