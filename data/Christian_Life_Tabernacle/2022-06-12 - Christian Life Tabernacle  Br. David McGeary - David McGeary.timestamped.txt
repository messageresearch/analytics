[17:18] morning amen he's here to pour out of

[17:23] salah to come in opening a word of
[17:25] prayer in a psalm reading this morning
[17:28] amen
[17:34] [Music]
[17:37] good morning to you welcome to the house
[17:39] of the lord
[17:41] sorry you've got the
[17:42] back up this morning
[17:44] but the bike is out he's gone to
[17:46] louisiana to get his girls as he calls
[17:48] him
[17:49] uh i know they've experienced a little
[17:50] sickness over there we want to remember
[17:52] them in prayer
[17:53] praise the lord bring them through all
[17:54] of that
[17:55] it's a good thing to come to the house
[17:57] of the lord
[17:59] we're going to read a psalm this morning
[18:00] 92.
[18:02] my bible
[18:03] labels it as a song for the sabbath day
[18:05] so i think it's very applicable
[18:10] how many are still feasting on the
[18:12] blessings of what brother billy brought
[18:15] us duty of expression
[18:20] i know i have it's been a benefit to me
[18:22] this week
[18:25] and even that subject title alone is a
[18:28] paradox
[18:30] in that it's our duty
[18:32] to do what the lord has called us to do
[18:33] fulfill our place
[18:35] but he does the expression
[18:38] and so many times we feel it's our duty
[18:40] to express god and we work it up we try
[18:43] to try to do the right things we try to
[18:45] produce fruit
[18:48] and that's not what we're called to do
[18:50] man we're just called to believe his
[18:52] word
[18:53] he said if you love me you'll keep my
[18:54] commandments
[18:56] amen i'm going to jump over
[18:59] to john 15 right quick
[19:02] and bring this to you sis
[19:04] jesus speaking
[19:05] it says i am the true vine and my father
[19:08] is the husband every branch in me that
[19:11] bears not fruit he taketh away and every
[19:13] branch said bear fruit he purges it that
[19:16] it may bring forth more fruit
[19:18] now ye are clean through the word which
[19:20] i have spoken unto you abide in me and i
[19:22] and you
[19:23] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[19:24] itself except it abide in the vine no
[19:27] more can ye except you abide in me i am
[19:29] the vine ye are the branches he that
[19:32] abideth in me and i in him the same
[19:34] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[19:37] you can do nothing
[19:39] if a man abide not in me in this cast
[19:41] forth he is cast forth as a branch and
[19:43] is withered
[19:44] and men gather them and cast them into
[19:46] the fire and they are burned
[19:48] and here's the promise that goes with
[19:49] that if ye abide in me and my words
[19:52] abide in you ye shall ask what ye will
[19:55] and it shall be done unto you amen
[19:57] that's our desire this morning
[20:00] and i'll i'll read a quote from uh you
[20:02] must be born again in 61 brother braham
[20:05] says when you're born again
[20:07] god vindicates you
[20:09] that's the fruit
[20:10] i added that he said that's how god
[20:12] vindicates all of his nature what by
[20:15] their fruits that's the way he
[20:16] vindicates his ministry that's right all
[20:18] of his servants are vindicated the same
[20:20] way he vindicates nature how do you know
[20:22] it's a peach tree because it bears
[20:24] preach it brings peaches how do you know
[20:26] it's an apple tree it's bearing apples
[20:28] how do you know it's a christian
[20:30] christian signs bear from it
[20:32] christian life comes out of it how do
[20:34] you know he's a teacher the word comes
[20:36] from him how do you know he's a prophet
[20:37] the word comes through him bears a
[20:39] record vindication it proves itself how
[20:42] does it become that
[20:44] when it dies and becomes one that's
[20:47] right when we die and become a new
[20:49] creature in christ jesus it gets us with
[20:51] our calling we stay with our calling the
[20:53] fruits of the spirit follow us when we
[20:56] are his servants
[20:57] when we are born again the fruits of
[20:59] christ's life follows us
[21:02] amen
[21:04] how do you know he's a christian he acts
[21:05] like christ he walks like christ he
[21:07] talks like christ he lives like christ
[21:09] above sin victorious
[21:12] what does he do say see what i've done
[21:14] christ didn't do that he gave all his
[21:16] praise to the father that's right how do
[21:18] you know it by their fruits you shall
[21:20] know them let's go to the lord in prayer
[21:22] before we read the psalm
[21:24] oh lord as we come in the
[21:26] assembly of this congregation lord we
[21:28] feel
[21:29] as the prophet isaiah lord
[21:32] i'm a man surely of unclean lips
[21:35] and lord i have need that
[21:37] you take a coal of fire off the altar
[21:39] lord
[21:40] purge my lips my mind
[21:42] lord you've sanctified my heart but
[21:45] lord we're humans
[21:47] we fight the devil in every turn lord
[21:50] lord we know we're sanctified and set
[21:52] aside for your service
[21:54] but lord we come in the presence of an
[21:56] almighty god you say woe is me
[22:00] so this morning lord we
[22:02] we pray that we can set aside all these
[22:04] things lord as we rub shoulders with the
[22:05] world
[22:06] we come into this congregation of
[22:10] people lord that are destined for a
[22:12] better place than this
[22:13] lord that we're going to spend eternity
[22:15] with we're thankful and gracious lord
[22:17] that you've allowed us to come together
[22:19] lord we can lift up songs of praise and
[22:22] worship
[22:23] lord and may we be lifted up as well may
[22:26] you take these old tired weary bodies
[22:28] lord cast them aside and like abraham
[22:30] and sarah
[22:31] lord restore us back to youthful bodies
[22:35] at least while we're in your presence
[22:37] lord
[22:38] lord you may benefit us
[22:40] and that way when we hear the word of
[22:42] god lord we can say that's me i believe
[22:44] it i accept it apply it to our lives
[22:47] lord
[22:48] for having been in the service we've
[22:49] drawn closer to you
[22:51] granted lord if there's any sick or
[22:52] needy in our presence also lord we pray
[22:55] for them
[22:56] those that are on the request list that
[22:58] are near and dear to our hearts
[23:00] granted lord jesus as we read this psalm
[23:02] lord may it just be quickened to us in
[23:04] the name of the lord jesus christ i pray
[23:07] amen amen
[23:09] pardon me
[23:11] psalm 92 and to go with that
[23:14] verse 12 it's been on my heart since
[23:17] brother george was here
[23:18] and it kind of quickened something to me
[23:20] it says the righteous shall flourish
[23:22] like the palm trees shall grow like a
[23:24] cedar in lebanon 13 rather
[23:26] those that be planted in the house of
[23:28] the lord shall flourish in the courts of
[23:31] our god amen that's what we desire to
[23:33] bear fruits i mean if we get it right we
[23:35] stay in his word it's a promise we will
[23:38] bear righteous fruits psalm 92 let's
[23:40] read it together
[23:41] it is a good thing to give thanks unto
[23:44] the lord and to sing praises unto thy
[23:46] name almost high to show forth thy
[23:49] loving kindness in the morning and thy
[23:51] faithfulness every night upon an
[23:54] instrument of ten strings and upon the
[23:56] psaltery upon the heart with a solemn
[23:58] sound for thou lord has made me glad
[24:01] through thy work i will triumph in the
[24:04] works of thy hands o lord how great are
[24:07] thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
[24:10] a brutish man knoweth not neither does a
[24:12] fool understand this when the wicked
[24:15] spring as a grass and when all the
[24:17] workers of iniquity do flourish it is
[24:19] that they shall be destroyed forever
[24:22] but thou lord are most high for evermore
[24:25] for the nine enemies o lord for lo thine
[24:28] enemies shall perish all the workers of
[24:30] iniquity shall be scattered but my horn
[24:33] shall thou exult like the horn of a
[24:35] unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh
[24:38] oil
[24:39] mine eyes also shall see the desire on
[24:41] mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my
[24:44] desire of the wicked that rise up
[24:46] against me the righteous shall flourish
[24:48] like the palm tree he shall grow like a
[24:51] cedar in lebanon those that be planted
[24:53] in the house of the lord shall flourish
[24:55] in the courts of our god they shall
[24:57] bring forth fruit in old age they shall
[25:00] be fat and flourishing they show that
[25:02] the lord is upright he is my rock and
[25:05] there is no unrighteousness in him

[56:38] i believe it's thessalonians
[56:40] here
[56:41] and uh the second thessalonians
[56:45] and the third chapter and we want to
[56:48] read
[56:51] five
[56:53] verses
[56:55] amen
[56:56] how many knows you can study the word of
[56:58] god
[57:00] but god makes you live the word of god
[57:03] and he's got ways of doing things that
[57:06] are beyond finding out
[57:09] amen but he's good isn't he he's really
[57:12] good
[57:13] amen so let's read these things i think
[57:15] this is great it touched my heart
[57:18] and gave me great comfort
[57:21] it says finally brethren pray for us
[57:25] that the word of the lord may have free
[57:27] course
[57:29] and be glorified even as it is with you
[57:36] and that we may be delivered
[57:38] from unreasonable and wicked men
[57:42] for all men have not faith
[57:46] but the lord is faithful
[57:48] whom shall establish you
[57:52] and keep you from evil
[57:55] and we have confidence
[57:57] in the lord touching you
[57:59] that you both do and will do the things
[58:03] which we
[58:04] command you
[58:05] and the lord direct your hearts

[58:14] waiting for christ
[58:17] amen gracious father
[58:19] we ask you to bless your word in jesus
[58:22] precious and holy and anger we pray amen
[58:26] god bless you may be seated this morning
[58:37] uh
[58:41] i don't know exactly how that i want to
[58:44] approach there was a certain
[58:46] subject on my heart and on my mind
[58:50] that i wanted to preach and yet
[58:54] it would tie to this but i never could
[58:56] get to it
[58:58] just the way that i wanted to
[59:00] but there there's there's something that
[59:03] i think that uh our all of our goals are
[59:08] and it's good to have goals i uh our
[59:11] goals are christian goals
[59:13] and
[59:14] uh you know i i was sitting this morning
[59:17] and thinking and when brother tim was
[59:19] reading
[59:20] that psalm
[59:22] and i i couldn't get it marked down
[59:24] quick enough but there's a part
[59:26] in there about keeping us in our age or
[59:29] something about that age well today's
[59:31] brother tim's birthday
[59:33] amen i think he just turned 30 something
[59:37] like that
[59:39] plus a little
[59:40] but uh so you know
[59:43] that's great and and it's a great
[59:46] comfort uh
[59:48] uh to know that
[59:50] you you really you're just one day older
[59:53] to being young again
[59:55] and and that's the great thing
[59:58] and we have a great change
[1:00:00] waiting for us
[1:00:02] and uh and that's what
[1:00:04] we we kind of been talking about
[1:00:08] is that we know that there's a
[1:00:10] perfection
[1:00:12] that we all want to come to
[1:00:16] and
[1:00:17] uh i think by our study and the
[1:00:20] revelation given to us in this day
[1:00:24] and the things that have been
[1:00:26] shared with us
[1:00:28] we understand
[1:00:30] that
[1:00:31] that
[1:00:32] our lives were pre-planned
[1:00:35] by god
[1:00:37] so that's what we
[1:00:39] have
[1:00:40] we've come to realize that god's got a
[1:00:43] reason and a purpose
[1:00:46] for everything
[1:00:48] and in the beginning
[1:00:51] was the word and the word was with god
[1:00:54] and the word was god and everything that
[1:00:57] was made and everything that was done
[1:01:00] and everything that's transpiring
[1:01:03] is by that word
[1:01:05] so in the beginning god created
[1:01:09] now
[1:01:10] and he was the author
[1:01:14] is that correct
[1:01:15] and the finisher
[1:01:17] of our faith
[1:01:19] so he just didn't write it
[1:01:21] and said now go finish it
[1:01:26] he just didn't draw out a map
[1:01:29] and then tell you
[1:01:31] to follow it
[1:01:33] no he's he's not that kind of god he's a
[1:01:36] shepherd
[1:01:38] and so the the shepherd
[1:01:41] he will even leave the 99
[1:01:45] and go out and find the one
[1:01:48] that that's lost
[1:01:51] and he picks it up and he puts it on his
[1:01:54] shoulders and and bears it back to the
[1:01:57] flock and
[1:02:01] and he'll do whatever he has to do
[1:02:04] to that little lamb
[1:02:06] to help it uh grow and mature
[1:02:10] and not be devoured by the wolves
[1:02:14] so he knows if that
[1:02:17] lamb
[1:02:18] leaves the flock and and goes out
[1:02:22] that
[1:02:23] that he's going to go into places that
[1:02:26] will
[1:02:27] cause uh that lamb to come into harm's
[1:02:30] way
[1:02:32] and that great love of that shepherd
[1:02:35] we're told is that
[1:02:37] he may sometimes take that lamb and
[1:02:40] hobble it
[1:02:43] uh and and by and sometimes hobbling you
[1:02:46] know what hobbling is where they tie two
[1:02:48] of your uh you do that to horses and
[1:02:51] stuff you tie two of their things
[1:02:53] together and they just can't run off
[1:02:56] so he hobbles it he says sometimes the
[1:02:59] shepherd would go as far as as
[1:03:03] breaking the
[1:03:04] lambs at the joint he would separate
[1:03:07] that joint or what we call break that
[1:03:09] lay
[1:03:10] so that he would have to be the one
[1:03:13] to keep that little lamb close and feed
[1:03:16] it and nourish it because that lamb
[1:03:18] wasn't over but what that lamb learned
[1:03:21] from that is he learned to stay close
[1:03:25] and you know sometimes you know
[1:03:28] god hobbles us
[1:03:30] and he does that by by allowing
[1:03:33] resistance to come in against the ideas
[1:03:37] and plans that we have
[1:03:39] sometimes
[1:03:42] that we're taught that sometimes god has
[1:03:44] to put us flat on our backs
[1:03:47] looking up at the ceiling in order to
[1:03:49] get our attention
[1:03:51] but all this comes under one great
[1:03:54] promise
[1:03:55] that i will not lose one
[1:03:58] amen so
[1:04:00] no matter the battle and struggle
[1:04:03] that we're having in this life no matter
[1:04:06] the different places
[1:04:08] that we
[1:04:10] find ourself in and the different
[1:04:13] troubles that we get ourselves in
[1:04:17] god has an end for us
[1:04:19] he knows what our thoughts are
[1:04:22] he knows
[1:04:23] what his thoughts are
[1:04:25] towards us
[1:04:27] and he knows what he wants to accomplish
[1:04:30] and so we know that we are
[1:04:33] striving
[1:04:35] for a perfection
[1:04:38] ami believes that the scripture says be
[1:04:40] perfect as he is perfect and there seems
[1:04:44] to be within us
[1:04:46] a natural
[1:04:48] force taking place
[1:04:50] and
[1:04:52] so i i don't know how to go back and
[1:04:54] kind of segue into this thought
[1:04:57] but
[1:04:58] even
[1:04:59] uh
[1:05:00] within us
[1:05:02] there's something inside of us isn't
[1:05:04] there
[1:05:05] and
[1:05:06] when you're striving for perfection and
[1:05:09] you're doing all that you're doing and
[1:05:12] you're living right and everything is
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:15] and you think is good all of a sudden
[1:05:19] something will rise up in you that
[1:05:21] you're not satisfied with where you are
[1:05:25] you should be satisfied
[1:05:28] you know what i mean
[1:05:30] i i've i've got a
[1:05:32] a a shiny new truck that brother daniels
[1:05:36] put together four or five times for me
[1:05:39] and painted it and polished it and
[1:05:41] patched it but it's a good truck
[1:05:43] you know i'm happy with that truck you
[1:05:45] know what i mean
[1:05:46] and things will be going good in your
[1:05:48] life and all of a sudden there's a
[1:05:51] thirst or a hunger or something that
[1:05:54] that you just know there's more
[1:05:57] you know
[1:05:58] you know there's more
[1:06:00] and and there is more for us
[1:06:03] and that's what we're looking out for
[1:06:05] and
[1:06:06] and god's got a pathway
[1:06:09] so there is
[1:06:12] there is a perfection
[1:06:14] that's happening in the bride
[1:06:16] but i'd like to switch over before i
[1:06:18] read uh several quotes this morning with
[1:06:22] you
[1:06:23] out of the book why christ speak
[1:06:26] is that we know there's two vines don't
[1:06:29] we
[1:06:30] we know there's the
[1:06:32] uh
[1:06:33] that every revival has twins
[1:06:37] and you know twins grow up together
[1:06:40] do you understand that
[1:06:42] in other words one twin
[1:06:44] doesn't get older
[1:06:46] than the other twin except by a few
[1:06:49] minutes
[1:06:50] you know i mean i think we have two or
[1:06:52] three sets of twins i'm not sure
[1:06:55] but i and if you talk to their parents
[1:06:58] they're
[1:07:00] born minutes apart
[1:07:01] or
[1:07:03] hours apart
[1:07:04] but i think usually when they have a
[1:07:07] birthday they have it together
[1:07:09] you know and
[1:07:10] you know i mean
[1:07:12] because they're so close together so
[1:07:15] you've got to remember that that
[1:07:18] things are allowed to grow up together
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:22] okay so we we
[1:07:24] our our understanding of things as we
[1:07:29] talked this morning
[1:07:31] so we also know that there are two types
[1:07:34] of seeds right there's the wheats and
[1:07:37] the tares
[1:07:39] and they were sowed
[1:07:41] and the scripture tells us that the lord
[1:07:43] told us to let them grow up
[1:07:47] together
[1:07:49] so
[1:07:50] we
[1:07:51] realized that there is a perfection
[1:07:56] of the elect taking place
[1:07:59] there's a perfection
[1:08:00] of the bride
[1:08:02] taking place so we know in the two vines
[1:08:08] we would call it two brides
[1:08:10] with satan uh
[1:08:13] jesus has a bride his church
[1:08:17] and satan has a bride and it's his
[1:08:19] church
[1:08:23] now
[1:08:24] so
[1:08:26] satan's bride in church
[1:08:29] is also coming to perfection
[1:08:33] and maturity
[1:08:35] so understand that okay as you sit here
[1:08:39] looking for
[1:08:41] a
[1:08:41] a separate perfection and a separate
[1:08:44] maturity in in the world today
[1:08:48] because satan's bride is is
[1:08:52] is coming to maturity
[1:08:55] they're also striving and growing for a
[1:08:58] perfection
[1:09:00] and seeking for ways amongst themselves
[1:09:04] to come to that perfection
[1:09:07] and and they'll have
[1:09:09] maybe disagreements within themselves
[1:09:12] different
[1:09:13] uh political standpoints and political
[1:09:17] views and they might kind of act like
[1:09:20] they're divided into democrats and
[1:09:24] republicans or socialists or
[1:09:26] progressives or or all the terminology
[1:09:30] but you've got to remember
[1:09:32] the only reason
[1:09:34] that they are struggling
[1:09:37] and going through what that they are
[1:09:39] going through is because they are trying
[1:09:41] to reach a perfection
[1:09:46] satan's trying to bring them
[1:09:50] into perfection
[1:09:53] and and every time that they
[1:09:56] they seemingly take a stand this way or
[1:10:00] stand that way and the media is out
[1:10:03] there writing the story out
[1:10:05] and the radio talk show hosts are blah
[1:10:08] blah blah blabbing you know and they're
[1:10:11] talking heads are just bobbling up and
[1:10:14] down all the time satan's in control
[1:10:20] they think that they're in trouble but
[1:10:22] he's the prince of the air
[1:10:25] the prince of this world
[1:10:31] we've got to be careful that
[1:10:34] we don't get caught up in what we would
[1:10:37] perceive as their struggle
[1:10:41] but their struggle is just the tool
[1:10:45] that their master
[1:10:47] and their leader is using to bring them
[1:10:51] to perfection
[1:10:54] so he wants them to reach a certain
[1:10:56] place and a certain achievement
[1:11:01] now we're talking about
[1:11:03] that there's another perfection going on
[1:11:08] so i mean it's not just that god's
[1:11:10] perfecting his bride satan's perfecting
[1:11:13] his pride
[1:11:16] and he's got a way that what he does to
[1:11:18] perfect the bride and we
[1:11:20] we sit back from the outside well we've
[1:11:23] got to sit back from the outside
[1:11:26] you understand we've got to stay out of
[1:11:29] it a good soldier doesn't entangle
[1:11:32] himself with the affairs of the world
[1:11:36] but but you you
[1:11:38] you've got you want to be uh harmless as
[1:11:41] a dove
[1:11:42] but you still want to be wise
[1:11:46] you you've got to understand though you
[1:11:48] might think it looks like chaos and
[1:11:50] those you can't understand this
[1:11:52] political view and that political view
[1:11:54] and i'm a liberal and i'm a conservative
[1:11:57] well i i'm both
[1:12:01] i'm a liberal in the spirit amen i've
[1:12:05] been liberated hallelujah praise god
[1:12:08] thank you jesus glory to god
[1:12:12] amen that ain't out of our life style
[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:17] you know i mean but i'm i'm i i'm
[1:12:20] conservative when it comes to sin and
[1:12:22] the things of the world i don't get
[1:12:25] involved in those things amen
[1:12:28] so i don't care
[1:12:30] what's going on out there
[1:12:33] and what appears to be chaos
[1:12:36] and what appears to be
[1:12:39] a
[1:12:41] conflict and issues and everything but
[1:12:44] believe me all satan's doing is
[1:12:47] preparing them to become a hundred
[1:12:50] percent
[1:12:51] reliable on him
[1:12:55] and he's already got a great big
[1:12:57] religious organization he's already got
[1:13:00] a guy crowned he's already got a vicar
[1:13:03] of christ here that will just swoop in
[1:13:06] and bail her out
[1:13:12] you know
[1:13:14] they'll
[1:13:16] they're
[1:13:16] they're growing to a perfection
[1:13:21] they're growing to a maturity
[1:13:24] now we talk about attributes
[1:13:27] don't we
[1:13:28] and the manifestation of attributes
[1:13:32] but you know
[1:13:35] satan's bride
[1:13:37] and his church
[1:13:40] his
[1:13:41] worldly
[1:13:42] spiritual
[1:13:44] church because we fight spiritual
[1:13:46] wickedness in high places
[1:13:50] right he's the prince of the air i mean
[1:13:52] he's
[1:13:53] he you know he's not a myth
[1:13:57] he's real
[1:14:00] and every day he's recruiting members
[1:14:05] he's spreading out his power
[1:14:08] he's taking control
[1:14:11] he's taking the
[1:14:12] control of
[1:14:14] the
[1:14:15] the the minds of the people
[1:14:20] there's a lot of tragedy in the world
[1:14:24] but tragedy uh
[1:14:27] uh and and threats and things
[1:14:30] changes the whole course
[1:14:33] of of uh
[1:14:35] situations
[1:14:40] you know
[1:14:41] one time a man tried to sneak
[1:14:44] i don't know if it was a little bit of
[1:14:45] explosives or a little something in his
[1:14:48] shoe
[1:14:49] one man
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:56] one shoe
[1:14:59] one heel
[1:15:01] one airplane flight
[1:15:04] what did that do
[1:15:08] it had everybody in the world taking off
[1:15:11] their shoes
[1:15:16] when they get on an airplane
[1:15:21] think of it
[1:15:24] one
[1:15:25] man
[1:15:28] with one shoe
[1:15:31] probably not in his right mind
[1:15:35] caused everybody to take off their shoe
[1:15:40] is that right
[1:15:42] i don't know some of you don't travel i
[1:15:44] know some people travel and they take
[1:15:46] off their shoe anyway i don't know
[1:15:50] but i'm just trying to be a fact
[1:15:53] okay well then they got pushed over to
[1:15:56] this side
[1:15:57] so they said oh we can't be making
[1:16:00] everybody take off a shoe so now they've
[1:16:02] gotten a special elite group of people
[1:16:06] you're called a trustee traveler
[1:16:12] they now decide to trust you
[1:16:15] that you won't put an explosive
[1:16:18] in
[1:16:18] your uh
[1:16:20] shoe
[1:16:22] and they place a little mark on you
[1:16:25] called i think is it tsa or something
[1:16:28] like that
[1:16:32] well that's uk
[1:16:37] pre-check
[1:16:39] oh tsa
[1:16:42] now you're in a special group of
[1:16:46] people i don't like the idea i've been
[1:16:49] pre-checked
[1:16:52] but i don't like the idea of me taking
[1:16:54] my shoes off either
[1:16:57] so now we're making choices between
[1:17:00] lesser
[1:17:02] evils
[1:17:06] so
[1:17:09] satan is driving the world
[1:17:14] to where he wants it to be
[1:17:17] if you don't think he's not in control
[1:17:19] of the world then why did he offer all
[1:17:21] the worlds to the lord he said look out
[1:17:23] here are all the kingdoms if you fall
[1:17:26] down and worship me
[1:17:28] i will give you all these kingdoms of
[1:17:32] the world i'll give them to you
[1:17:36] and he said get behind me
[1:17:39] satan
[1:17:41] you know thou shalt not tempt the lord
[1:17:44] thy god
[1:17:46] and so we see that he is also
[1:17:50] building attributes his attributes his
[1:17:54] thinking
[1:17:57] and you say well
[1:17:58] is that true well let if we just jump to
[1:18:01] the other side of the aisle
[1:18:03] uh
[1:18:04] uh so i'm looking out this way so if i
[1:18:06] say well this is satan's bride on this
[1:18:09] side well you don't feel that that's
[1:18:12] satan's bride because you're looking
[1:18:14] this way so this side to you is this
[1:18:16] side over here
[1:18:19] so it doesn't but so if you you look on
[1:18:21] this side
[1:18:24] he's bringing them in the mind but this
[1:18:26] over here he said let this mind be in
[1:18:29] you that was in christ
[1:18:31] so if he's trying to perfect if we feel
[1:18:34] that we brought into perfection by
[1:18:36] having the mind of christ don't you
[1:18:38] think that they've got to be brought
[1:18:40] into perfection to having the mind
[1:18:44] of their husband
[1:18:49] and that's what's going on
[1:18:51] he another all i want us to do is to
[1:18:54] stand back and look this morning and
[1:18:56] understand that there's two perfections
[1:18:59] going on
[1:19:00] don't stand in awe
[1:19:04] of what's happening in the world
[1:19:07] you might think that they're
[1:19:11] they're all separated and divided
[1:19:14] but all that separation and dividing is
[1:19:17] doing is causing them to realize that in
[1:19:20] order to survive they're going to have
[1:19:22] to become one
[1:19:29] and he'll starve him out if he has to
[1:19:32] he'll do whatever it takes
[1:19:35] to get them to the place
[1:19:39] where he sits on the throne
[1:19:42] of their hearts their
[1:19:44] thoughts their minds and their lives
[1:19:48] he'll bring them to the place where they
[1:19:49] think they have peace and safety
[1:19:53] but remember sudden destruction
[1:19:56] is going to come
[1:19:58] so we understand that he's he's got this
[1:20:01] great
[1:20:02] uh this great bride and this great
[1:20:05] display and what he's doing is is
[1:20:07] satan's attributes are all on display
[1:20:13] all his attributes are on display his
[1:20:15] whole kingdom
[1:20:16] is coming to maturity
[1:20:19] the the spirits in the maturity are are
[1:20:23] gaining influence and and
[1:20:26] they have media and social media where
[1:20:29] they can spread his message
[1:20:31] just like that
[1:20:33] and we cannot sit back
[1:20:35] and be totally ignorant of the fact that
[1:20:39] there is another kingdom growing up
[1:20:42] right alongside of us
[1:20:49] and you cannot remain neutral
[1:20:54] you can't serve to master
[1:21:00] do you understand the more they move
[1:21:02] into perfection
[1:21:05] and the more they move into maturity
[1:21:08] and the more they take form
[1:21:11] and the more that they gain the ability
[1:21:14] to express
[1:21:17] you don't think that that spirit's not
[1:21:20] moving
[1:21:23] in their kingdom you can choose what
[1:21:26] gender you want to be
[1:21:29] i mean that's nuts
[1:21:36] i mean
[1:21:37] that
[1:21:38] [Music]
[1:21:40] marriage is is not the definition of
[1:21:43] marriage doesn't exist any way the way
[1:21:47] we knew it
[1:21:49] all it is is an economical and tax
[1:21:52] contract between two people and
[1:21:55] everybody should get same tax privileges
[1:21:59] so in our country if you're married and
[1:22:01] and you have a wife then you got a
[1:22:03] special tax privilege
[1:22:06] so everybody else said well i don't like
[1:22:08] i'm with a man well
[1:22:10] you need to call that marriage so i can
[1:22:13] get a special tax privilege
[1:22:16] you know remember the love of money
[1:22:20] is the root of all evil
[1:22:24] all these things are driven by money all
[1:22:26] these things are are driven by the
[1:22:29] social structure
[1:22:32] it it it's it's driven by something and
[1:22:36] people's minds are being changed
[1:22:40] people's thinking is being changed his
[1:22:43] kingdom is trying is starting to take
[1:22:45] hold
[1:22:47] and and as it takes hold
[1:22:49] and as he gains strength and he gains
[1:22:53] maturity he is going to wash out
[1:22:59] everybody
[1:23:01] that's not part of it
[1:23:06] and you don't want to be be found in
[1:23:08] that group
[1:23:09] that's washed out of his group
[1:23:12] but you're not part of his bride either
[1:23:18] because that's what's going to be spewed
[1:23:21] out of his mouth
[1:23:26] oh i just might as well
[1:23:28] you know i hope you understand
[1:23:30] that when he says be either hot or cold
[1:23:33] but don't be lukewarm else i'll spill
[1:23:36] thee out of my mouth that that wasn't
[1:23:38] actually going to be produced in the
[1:23:41] form of a system and in the lives of men
[1:23:44] the word of god is not little catch
[1:23:47] phrases the word of god is coming to
[1:23:50] pass every day
[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:56] lukewarm is was produced
[1:23:59] by hot and cold lukewarm is produced by
[1:24:03] the bride of jesus christ and the bride
[1:24:06] of satan
[1:24:09] and it produces a bunch of middlemen
[1:24:16] a bunch of borderliners
[1:24:19] and you're going to find out neither
[1:24:21] side wants them
[1:24:25] so you might as well not be caught in
[1:24:27] the middle
[1:24:30] you understand
[1:24:32] you might as well young people
[1:24:33] especially those of you that are
[1:24:35] starting your careers you you
[1:24:37] you need to ask for isab
[1:24:41] that you can see
[1:24:42] that you can see all these corporate
[1:24:45] things and all these great opportunities
[1:24:47] and all these job offers
[1:24:50] and all these stuff you better really
[1:24:52] pray down to
[1:24:54] do the guts of your soul
[1:24:58] to make sure that you're not joining
[1:25:04] a very
[1:25:06] deceitful
[1:25:11] culture and civilization and church
[1:25:15] everybody in this world goes to church
[1:25:20] every day
[1:25:22] they're in church
[1:25:25] now they now might not be in the house
[1:25:27] of god or the assembly of god but every
[1:25:30] day they're worshiping in some church
[1:25:33] somewhere they're a part of something
[1:25:36] they're giving their duty they're giving
[1:25:38] their lip service they're giving their
[1:25:40] labor they're giving their money to
[1:25:42] something
[1:25:47] and in the hour
[1:25:50] and the time
[1:25:53] and the prophecy
[1:25:57] is is
[1:25:58] is
[1:25:59] predetermined by god
[1:26:01] and it's just good for us
[1:26:04] to wake up
[1:26:06] and recognize the day and the message
[1:26:09] and the hour that we're living in
[1:26:13] and part of that i believe is to
[1:26:15] recognize the maturity of satan's bride
[1:26:22] and the maturity of his church
[1:26:25] and their attributes
[1:26:28] and their power
[1:26:30] and how that he's seizing the mind
[1:26:40] of the people
[1:26:43] and that is
[1:26:46] i always like
[1:26:49] to
[1:26:51] you know i i don't know how to say this
[1:26:53] but
[1:26:56] you have to
[1:26:58] at least realize
[1:27:00] that satan is a very good adversary
[1:27:04] he's very smart he's very intelligent
[1:27:09] he'll take things so far one way
[1:27:13] that you'll settle on a compromise which
[1:27:16] is lesser than the position you held
[1:27:18] before
[1:27:24] he's got all these radicals jumping up
[1:27:26] and crying up and everybody's going oh
[1:27:34] but all he's done is you say anything
[1:27:38] less than not and then he offers some
[1:27:40] little compromise in school
[1:27:43] some so what did he do first first he
[1:27:45] took the prayer out of school
[1:27:48] then he took the bible out of school
[1:27:51] now he's way over here trying to
[1:27:53] teach division
[1:27:55] between people and
[1:27:57] and colors and races and all that and do
[1:28:00] you realize how contrary that is to
[1:28:02] god's word god is no respecter of person
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:11] god is no respecter as a person
[1:28:14] every man's life
[1:28:17] has a purpose
[1:28:19] but not every man's life has a purpose
[1:28:22] in this world
[1:28:26] and that's the trouble
[1:28:31] there's people that are not part of
[1:28:34] satan's bride
[1:28:36] there are people that are not part of
[1:28:38] his kingdom
[1:28:40] there are people that do not possess his
[1:28:43] attributes
[1:28:45] there are people that do not fit in the
[1:28:48] world
[1:28:50] and the bride of jesus christ does not
[1:28:53] fit in this world
[1:28:57] we're not even of this world
[1:29:00] we're in this world but we're not of
[1:29:03] this world we don't even come from this
[1:29:06] world
[1:29:08] well we've got to get a real stark
[1:29:11] realization in us to be able to look out
[1:29:15] there and say wow satan's bride's coming
[1:29:17] to perfection they're turning this world
[1:29:20] into exactly what they want to live
[1:29:22] they're making it a place that only they
[1:29:25] can live
[1:29:26] even so come quickly lord jesus
[1:29:32] they're pressing for it
[1:29:36] but the whole reason that he's getting
[1:29:39] all these attributes and all this great
[1:29:42] uh maturity and and and he's starting to
[1:29:46] put on his display is that's to oppress
[1:29:52] the bride of jesus christ
[1:29:57] because they're both struggling
[1:30:00] for our world
[1:30:05] isn't that what satan did he exalted
[1:30:08] himself above the stars of god
[1:30:11] and he placed himself
[1:30:13] on the throne of the world as if he was
[1:30:16] god
[1:30:20] you can't let these things slip
[1:30:22] church
[1:30:23] you can't get caught up on friday
[1:30:25] paycheck
[1:30:27] and on on your rent and
[1:30:30] and on your money and and whether you
[1:30:32] have nike shoes or or whatever shoe
[1:30:37] you know that you want
[1:30:39] you you can't let your minds get
[1:30:41] swallowed up in the littleness
[1:30:45] of the world
[1:30:50] we're not in a struggle
[1:30:53] that's right
[1:30:55] you understand we're in a war
[1:30:59] we're in a battle
[1:31:04] you know i mean
[1:31:05] we have an enemy
[1:31:08] that's growing in great strength
[1:31:12] and maturity
[1:31:14] and trying to rob from us
[1:31:17] our thinking
[1:31:19] our faith
[1:31:21] our attributes
[1:31:23] our works
[1:31:26] he wants to make the bride of jesus
[1:31:28] christ of none
[1:31:30] effect
[1:31:32] that's what he's trying to do
[1:31:35] so we've got to understand that
[1:31:37] when we see
[1:31:42] the day
[1:31:43] and we see the enemy
[1:31:46] rising in maturity we see satan taking
[1:31:49] control of the kingdoms of the world we
[1:31:52] see him pushing church out you know that
[1:31:56] for the first time in american history
[1:31:59] that there's less
[1:32:01] people go to church in the united states
[1:32:04] i can only speak the united states
[1:32:08] then
[1:32:12] go to church
[1:32:15] it used to be 60 40 at least americans
[1:32:19] went and participated in religious
[1:32:22] services regularly
[1:32:25] now over 60 percent of our country
[1:32:27] doesn't go to church
[1:32:29] at all
[1:32:32] well they go to church
[1:32:34] they just don't realize
[1:32:37] that some of them have a baseball
[1:32:38] denomination a hockey denomination a
[1:32:41] football denomination college
[1:32:43] denomination youth sports whatever it is
[1:32:47] i mean where they are
[1:32:49] and and where they scream and holler and
[1:32:52] worship
[1:32:56] but so as we see that perfection coming
[1:32:59] understand that the reason that he's
[1:33:02] perfecting his
[1:33:05] church
[1:33:06] he and perfecting satan's perfecting his
[1:33:09] church and satan's perfecting his army
[1:33:13] he's perfecting that army to be in
[1:33:16] in total opposition
[1:33:18] to what it is that you are trying to
[1:33:22] achieve
[1:33:26] so he's trying to make it
[1:33:29] very difficult for you to achieve
[1:33:32] the perfection
[1:33:34] that you want to achieve
[1:33:37] and so that's where i want to start
[1:33:40] reading now
[1:33:42] because god has a way
[1:33:45] to perfect
[1:33:48] his church
[1:33:52] now satan would like us to use his
[1:33:54] techniques
[1:33:56] and his ways
[1:33:58] and borrow from him
[1:34:02] but the bride of jesus christ
[1:34:08] she only comes into existence both of
[1:34:12] these kingdoms
[1:34:14] satan's kingdom
[1:34:16] and his bride and his church and jesus
[1:34:20] bride and his kingdom and his church
[1:34:23] are all results of prophecy
[1:34:27] satan is doing exactly what is
[1:34:30] prophesied of him
[1:34:32] you are here this morning i'm speaking
[1:34:34] to you as believers i'm speaking to you
[1:34:36] as the bride of jesus christ i'm
[1:34:39] speaking to you of of because of what
[1:34:42] you are and who you are you are here
[1:34:46] because he prophesied for you to be here
[1:34:50] or he spoke of you to be here
[1:34:54] that's why you're here
[1:34:56] he chose you to be here in this hour
[1:34:59] before the foundations of the world
[1:35:06] that that he
[1:35:08] that that's a given
[1:35:12] right that's why we call ourselves the
[1:35:14] what the elect
[1:35:17] the chosen
[1:35:19] the elect lady
[1:35:21] the church
[1:35:22] the bride so we understand that the
[1:35:26] world is espoused to their husband
[1:35:29] their god
[1:35:31] and we are in spouse to our husband
[1:35:35] now we are espoused by the word of god
[1:35:39] and and we are only brought
[1:35:42] and reached out to
[1:35:46] by the prophecy that was spoken
[1:35:49] of us
[1:35:52] america the only reason each of you
[1:35:55] in your life wherever you were whatever
[1:35:59] you were doing whether you were in sin
[1:36:02] alcohol drugs whether you were in prison
[1:36:05] whether you were in financial difficulty
[1:36:08] it doesn't matter where you were where
[1:36:10] you grew up the only reason you got
[1:36:12] contacted and reached because there was
[1:36:15] something in you that god put in you
[1:36:18] [Applause]
[1:36:23] and that was calling out to him
[1:36:27] you didn't know it
[1:36:31] you didn't understand it
[1:36:34] you didn't perceive
[1:36:36] it but yet it was working and struggling
[1:36:40] to get back to the place that it was
[1:36:44] meant to be
[1:36:50] it's
[1:36:50] amazing
[1:36:52] so let's just read if you would and
[1:36:55] we'll just go through these things
[1:36:56] because i think there's some great
[1:36:58] understanding
[1:37:00] in some of these things
[1:37:02] we're going to read in why christ speak
[1:37:05] and i think they can put it up on the
[1:37:06] board i hope
[1:37:08] their program matches my paragraph 29
[1:37:18] and that's why christ speak and that's
[1:37:20] the one that's preached in 1963
[1:37:24] i think the 14th of july
[1:37:28] do we have that
[1:37:34] i'm not a very good reader so
[1:37:36] when you can see it on the board it
[1:37:38] helps me a lot
[1:37:40] all right so
[1:37:41] let's just
[1:37:43] listen to this and we're just going to
[1:37:44] go through this and point out some
[1:37:46] things and have some real fellowship in
[1:37:48] what the prophet of god told us
[1:37:50] all right
[1:37:52] he says many times when we look at the
[1:37:55] scriptures
[1:37:57] in our own way of looking
[1:38:00] it seems very hard
[1:38:03] but if we study it a little while
[1:38:06] we find out that all
[1:38:09] that the
[1:38:11] all-wise god
[1:38:13] knows just
[1:38:15] what he's doing
[1:38:17] so god knew
[1:38:19] what he was doing
[1:38:21] when he allowed these two seeds
[1:38:24] and these two twins
[1:38:26] and these two revivals to go on
[1:38:30] simultaneously
[1:38:31] he knew what he was doing
[1:38:33] now if i was running the show
[1:38:39] none of you would be here
[1:38:42] because i would have wrote it that god
[1:38:44] comes to the rich in this world
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:49] but no what does he come to he comes to
[1:38:52] the poor of this world
[1:38:55] rich in what
[1:38:57] faith
[1:39:00] so he knows what he's doing he knew
[1:39:02] he allowed satan to go out there have a
[1:39:05] bride he's allowing this world to go the
[1:39:08] way that it's going he's allowing
[1:39:10] because
[1:39:11] they're they're there for the sole
[1:39:13] purpose of opposing you
[1:39:19] because let me tell you something until
[1:39:21] something's tested
[1:39:25] it's just a claim
[1:39:31] you take some of these brothers that are
[1:39:33] in trades
[1:39:36] you know better gyro he's a a drywall
[1:39:39] guy if i ca if i went and told showed up
[1:39:42] on his job and said i'm a drywall man
[1:39:47] he's okay go mix me some mud and go spot
[1:39:49] nail these things and run that joint
[1:39:51] over there tape in those corners i'll be
[1:39:52] back in a little bit
[1:39:55] well i'll guarantee there'd be more mud
[1:39:57] on the floor than on the wall
[1:40:01] now just think of that
[1:40:06] okay god knows what he's doing
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:09] so i can say
[1:40:12] make any claim
[1:40:15] but that claim has got to be brought to
[1:40:19] a reality
[1:40:21] if it just remains clean
[1:40:26] just like the letter of this book
[1:40:29] and the prophecies of this book
[1:40:31] they as long as they lay there as
[1:40:34] prophecy
[1:40:36] there
[1:40:37] they are allowed to be interpreted the
[1:40:41] way that any man wants to
[1:40:43] but that's not how god interprets his
[1:40:46] word how does he interpret his word
[1:40:50] by bringing it to past
[1:40:52] in other words he takes it from word to
[1:40:56] reality
[1:40:57] so remember god's word becomes flesh
[1:41:01] both sides of the prophecy his bride
[1:41:04] becomes flesh and the lord's bride
[1:41:07] becomes flesh
[1:41:08] they both have to come into a reality
[1:41:11] they all both have to come into
[1:41:13] a tested existence
[1:41:18] so the world tests us
[1:41:23] to prove if we're what
[1:41:25] we say we are
[1:41:27] and the world tests them
[1:41:30] so they can prove that they are who they
[1:41:33] say they are
[1:41:36] no middle ground
[1:41:46] he knows what he's doing
[1:41:48] and he knows how to do it
[1:41:52] these things
[1:41:54] and how to deal with man
[1:41:58] god knows how to deal with man
[1:42:02] everything that's going on god's got
[1:42:05] control of it he knows how he's this is
[1:42:07] not this is not me this is what our
[1:42:09] messenger told us
[1:42:11] he knows
[1:42:12] what's in man
[1:42:16] he knows him
[1:42:18] we
[1:42:19] don't
[1:42:21] we only know from the intellectual side
[1:42:26] he knows what's really in
[1:42:30] the man
[1:42:35] how many of you really thought someone
[1:42:37] was really good and righteous and
[1:42:39] upright and
[1:42:40] my my my and then all of a sudden you
[1:42:43] just were so disappointed
[1:42:49] well i've got a car to sell you
[1:42:52] it mostly just sat in the garage
[1:42:56] little grandma had this car
[1:42:59] i'll tell you she's
[1:43:01] she's low mileage and
[1:43:03] and
[1:43:04] she's a beauty and i'll sell this car
[1:43:07] you know it's probably worth eight
[1:43:10] thousand dollars but i'll tell you what
[1:43:11] i'll sell this car to you for three
[1:43:13] thousand dollars
[1:43:17] you know
[1:43:18] well look at it
[1:43:20] pete omer says it only has
[1:43:22] 90
[1:43:23] uh uh
[1:43:24] thousand miles on it
[1:43:26] well you know this just little old lady
[1:43:28] she'd go to the grocery store two or
[1:43:30] three times a day because
[1:43:32] it's a bag of wind
[1:43:38] it's a sales pitch
[1:43:41] it's not the what
[1:43:43] truth
[1:43:46] well satan's selling his kingdom
[1:43:49] how does he sell his kingdom he sells
[1:43:51] this kingdom
[1:43:53] through
[1:43:55] science
[1:43:56] education
[1:43:58] and civilization
[1:43:59] but there's no truth in them
[1:44:02] you understand there's no truth
[1:44:05] in the world around us there's no truth
[1:44:07] in it
[1:44:08] the outcome of it is going to be
[1:44:10] destroyed
[1:44:11] so we have got to focus in
[1:44:17] and set our hearts to the perfection
[1:44:21] that god has for us
[1:44:23] and the fulfillment he is fulfilling the
[1:44:26] purpose for which god allowed him into
[1:44:29] the world now we must get to the place
[1:44:31] where we're fulfilling the purpose that
[1:44:34] god has put us here for
[1:44:38] and moses is such a great example of
[1:44:41] that
[1:44:43] and he says so he knows what's really in
[1:44:46] men
[1:44:48] moses was born in this world this is the
[1:44:51] next paragraph 30
[1:44:53] born in this world a gifted boy
[1:44:58] and he was born
[1:45:00] to be a prophet
[1:45:02] a deliverer
[1:45:05] he was born with the equipment
[1:45:08] born in him and every man that comes in
[1:45:11] the world is born with this equipment
[1:45:15] i think you touched on that some
[1:45:17] wednesday right
[1:45:18] that
[1:45:19] that equipped
[1:45:21] so every single one of you have been put
[1:45:24] here
[1:45:25] for a purpose
[1:45:27] and within you is the equipment
[1:45:32] to fulfill the purpose
[1:45:35] god made you that way
[1:45:38] the trouble is is it's not
[1:45:41] a cloned piece of armor
[1:45:45] that we can go down and buy at the
[1:45:47] christian
[1:45:50] store
[1:45:53] it's developed
[1:45:56] by the opposition
[1:46:02] of the enemy
[1:46:06] because you can't add it right in the
[1:46:08] statue of a perfect man
[1:46:11] until it's been proved and tested
[1:46:15] he said don't try to add uh
[1:46:18] uh he says if you have faith he said
[1:46:22] don't try to add virtue
[1:46:24] until you've got the faith
[1:46:27] don't try to add knowledge till you've
[1:46:29] got the strength and the virtue
[1:46:32] so every test of the way every step of
[1:46:35] the ladder you've got to have the
[1:46:37] strength to make every step of the
[1:46:39] ladder
[1:46:41] and so as we read here we'll try to move
[1:46:43] through this quickly
[1:46:46] he was equipped
[1:46:49] and born in him
[1:46:51] as every man that comes into the world
[1:46:55] is born with this equipment
[1:47:01] as i firmly believe
[1:47:03] in the foreknowledge and
[1:47:06] predestination of god
[1:47:10] you believe that
[1:47:15] unless
[1:47:16] and there's i could just keep reading
[1:47:18] because every paragraph's
[1:47:20] wonderful but
[1:47:23] he said in paragraph 32 therefore
[1:47:27] when a person tries to be something they
[1:47:33] are not
[1:47:34] they are only making an impersonation
[1:47:38] and sooner or later it will find you out
[1:47:42] your sins will find you out
[1:47:45] you cannot cover them
[1:47:48] there is only one covering for sin and
[1:47:51] that's the blood of jesus christ
[1:47:54] and it cannot be applied unless god has
[1:47:58] called you from the foundations of the
[1:48:02] world hallelujah
[1:48:07] that's why religion is a what
[1:48:10] it's a covering but god knows what's in
[1:48:13] man another he knows the prophecy
[1:48:17] that what he spoke of you
[1:48:20] and what that he's trying to get you to
[1:48:23] be
[1:48:24] that's right and we're going to move
[1:48:26] down you'll listen to this great
[1:48:27] statement that he makes
[1:48:29] he said
[1:48:33] and it cannot be applied
[1:48:36] unless god has called you from the
[1:48:37] foundation of the world
[1:48:39] that's what the blood was sent for
[1:48:45] not to be trampled upon
[1:48:48] not made fun of
[1:48:50] and jabbed at
[1:48:52] or evilly spoken of and so forth
[1:48:56] it was for a direct
[1:49:00] purpose
[1:49:02] get that established
[1:49:04] you're elected
[1:49:06] you're chosen
[1:49:08] there's something in you you have a
[1:49:10] blood that came for a direct purpose
[1:49:14] and that blood is only applied to those
[1:49:18] whose names were written on the lamb's
[1:49:20] book of life
[1:49:21] because he couldn't be a redeemer and a
[1:49:25] kinsmen redeemer unless he had a kinsmen
[1:49:28] to redeem
[1:49:30] amen
[1:49:34] so you weren't his kin from this world
[1:49:37] you were his kin from before the world
[1:49:40] when the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:49:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:49:50] this is about getting us back
[1:50:00] and we don't want we don't need to go
[1:50:02] into the fall
[1:50:05] because the evidence of the fall is
[1:50:07] coming to maturity
[1:50:10] we want to understand that we are now
[1:50:12] wanting to come into the reality
[1:50:16] and to the the
[1:50:18] prophecy of god being made flesh
[1:50:22] concerning the rapture of the church and
[1:50:25] the leaving of his
[1:50:27] his generation and his people
[1:50:31] from this world
[1:50:35] how many believes that's on the agenda
[1:50:38] how many understand that that's the last
[1:50:41] thing left on the agenda for the church
[1:50:45] she's received rapturing faith through
[1:50:47] the message of the hour the last thing
[1:50:50] for her to do is leave
[1:50:57] no other accomplishment
[1:51:04] but that is what we want to accomplish
[1:51:08] let's just read if you don't mind with
[1:51:10] me please
[1:51:11] that's right
[1:51:13] so the blood had a purpose
[1:51:16] the blood
[1:51:17] was
[1:51:20] purpose
[1:51:21] was based on
[1:51:23] the purpose that god gave you
[1:51:29] do you understand that
[1:51:32] he had a purpose for you jackson
[1:51:36] by no fault of your own
[1:51:38] you got sucked into this world you came
[1:51:41] in this world speaking lies you came
[1:51:43] into this world sin all the situations
[1:51:46] and circumcisions you didn't pick your
[1:51:48] parents believe it or not god picked
[1:51:50] them for you
[1:51:53] he picked your grandparents for you
[1:51:55] he picked everything in for you he i and
[1:51:58] i don't know he may have done it so for
[1:52:01] you to sit there and say i got no hope
[1:52:04] so he could be your hope
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:10] all the reasons he put you together and
[1:52:12] made you whatever you were was for his
[1:52:15] sole purpose and for his soul glory
[1:52:26] now the blood came
[1:52:30] not just for jesus to hang on the cross
[1:52:33] that whoever get there he came for one
[1:52:36] thing i have got to pay
[1:52:39] the price for the thing that's keeping
[1:52:43] this
[1:52:44] man or this woman from coming to the
[1:52:48] maturity that i prophesied for him
[1:52:56] so the only thing that holds most of us
[1:52:58] back is guilt
[1:53:06] so he's got a purpose
[1:53:09] believe me he just didn't drop down
[1:53:11] become savior of the world
[1:53:16] no he knew who would and who wouldn't
[1:53:18] believe
[1:53:20] he knew who his children were so he made
[1:53:22] provision
[1:53:24] for them
[1:53:26] now remember all this time we're reading
[1:53:28] this this other kingdom is coming to
[1:53:30] maturity
[1:53:32] so we've got to realize quick we've got
[1:53:34] to start coming to maturity we've got to
[1:53:36] start taking these things
[1:53:39] that our messenger laid for us in the
[1:53:41] storehouse of god's word and making them
[1:53:44] a reality and living in our flesh
[1:53:48] that's right
[1:53:49] not to be played with
[1:53:51] not to be impersonated by saying that
[1:53:55] the sins are covered when they're not
[1:53:59] and no man
[1:54:00] can have his sins covered lest his name
[1:54:04] was put on the lamb's book of life
[1:54:07] before the foundations of the world
[1:54:11] hallelujah
[1:54:14] so
[1:54:17] it's it's so
[1:54:19] simple
[1:54:20] it's beautiful
[1:54:23] so if they couldn't be covered unless
[1:54:25] their names were put there from the
[1:54:27] foundation of the world what did he do
[1:54:30] he came to cover the sins
[1:54:33] of those whose names were written on the
[1:54:35] lamb's book of the world why did he have
[1:54:37] to come because he had to cover those
[1:54:41] why did he have to cover him because
[1:54:42] your name was there
[1:54:46] glory to god that takes my righteousness
[1:54:49] from out of the picture if you can do
[1:54:51] one thing for your salvation jesus
[1:54:53] christ died in vain praise god
[1:54:58] you mean this little wretched mess that
[1:55:01] i am that can goof everything up there
[1:55:03] is in the whole world
[1:55:05] was already in the land's book of life
[1:55:07] thank you lord
[1:55:09] praise god
[1:55:12] don't look like you don't know it i i'll
[1:55:15] cover every doubter before long
[1:55:19] because that's what the word of god is
[1:55:21] for
[1:55:22] it's to remove the doubt
[1:55:27] it's to bring
[1:55:29] that faith
[1:55:31] alive
[1:55:32] in you
[1:55:35] that will rise up and speak against
[1:55:39] the opposition
[1:55:44] and won't just cry
[1:55:47] and and that's what we get into yeah
[1:55:50] we're in all this struggle and all this
[1:55:52] stuff that's going on and our life's not
[1:55:55] working and i got everybody's opposing
[1:55:58] me and
[1:55:59] and we'll cry cry cry cry cry

[1:56:46] my side

[1:56:53] build buildings
[1:56:55] god's here to build character
[1:57:01] god's here to bring me into perfection
[1:57:04] god's here to put his mind in me

[2:00:42] you can't come i can't come into
[2:00:44] perfection
[2:00:46] so finally i stayed home all day
[2:00:48] yesterday you know
[2:00:50] and
[2:00:51] by this morning i woke up
[2:00:54] and i thought lord thank you
[2:00:57] for having the city shut me down
[2:01:00] because if i would have worked yesterday
[2:01:02] i would not be in the pulpit this
[2:01:04] morning
[2:01:06] i needed a day of rest
[2:01:12] the sun was hot
[2:01:14] the sun was dying
[2:01:15] i was pressed out to the max
[2:01:18] and i thought
[2:01:22] god shut down
[2:01:23] a airline
[2:01:25] for a little little lady
[2:01:27] do you
[2:01:28] if he needs to shut down a job site
[2:01:31] thank you jesus
[2:01:34] why cry
[2:01:37] okay lord great thank you for the day
[2:01:39] off
[2:01:42] you know what lies down the road
[2:01:45] you stopped it for a reason let us find
[2:01:48] out what the reason is let's get the
[2:01:50] solution lord help me
[2:01:53] help them
[2:01:55] let us just come to something that works
[2:01:57] good for everybody
[2:01:59] and if they're unreasonable in
[2:02:00] everything
[2:02:02] we got a god that can deal
[2:02:04] with that too
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:07] so sometimes what i'm trying to point
[2:02:09] out in all what i just said is sometimes
[2:02:12] you don't realize what's really taking
[2:02:14] place
[2:02:15] but what god's doing is he's making this
[2:02:19] message
[2:02:20] by using the oppressor
[2:02:23] to come alive in you
[2:02:29] let's just read a few more great things
[2:02:30] because i want we we're watching the
[2:02:33] the
[2:02:34] development of moses
[2:02:38] come into place
[2:02:41] he said
[2:02:43] and then he says this
[2:02:45] for a direct verse and no man
[2:02:48] can unless his name is written on the
[2:02:49] lamb's book of life before they found
[2:02:51] the world jesus said himself no man can
[2:02:55] come to me except my father draws him
[2:02:58] and all the father
[2:03:00] hath past tense given me
[2:03:03] will
[2:03:04] come to me that's right so you can't
[2:03:08] make
[2:03:10] the words lie
[2:03:12] they are there for truth and for
[2:03:16] a correction
[2:03:18] amen now we're just going to jump over
[2:03:20] to another paragraph here
[2:03:23] and and this is
[2:03:25] uh
[2:03:28] and this is paragraph 37 and 38.
[2:03:36] so
[2:03:36] he says now
[2:03:38] he says now then see
[2:03:41] that he was born with this great gift
[2:03:45] and quality within him
[2:03:48] right
[2:03:49] so haven't we all
[2:03:51] came to the conclusion
[2:03:54] that we all were born with the seed of
[2:03:56] god in us amen
[2:03:59] now i know at different stages even in
[2:04:02] our church different people go through
[2:04:04] the the battle of whether that seeds
[2:04:07] in you or not
[2:04:12] but if you're having that battle
[2:04:16] and you've sat here for the last hour
[2:04:20] there's a pretty good chance that seed's
[2:04:22] in you
[2:04:26] but something's got to happen to that
[2:04:28] seed
[2:04:29] so let's just read a little bit okay
[2:04:31] you're with me am i okay
[2:04:33] matthew's going to take care of me
[2:04:35] tonight so i got to get what i have on
[2:04:37] my heart off
[2:04:39] he says then he was born with this great
[2:04:41] gift and quality within him then it only
[2:04:44] takes something to flash across that to
[2:04:47] bring that thing to life
[2:04:53] now
[2:04:54] just remember
[2:04:57] it
[2:04:58] we always talk about the spirit of god
[2:05:00] flashing across and the word flashing
[2:05:02] across that's what germinates at the sea
[2:05:04] too but sometimes it's the very
[2:05:07] opposition of the enemy that brings it
[2:05:10] to life
[2:05:15] you know what i mean all of a sudden you
[2:05:17] find yourself like
[2:05:19] you know i the situation i found myself
[2:05:22] in
[2:05:23] i'm sitting in a room with a bunch of
[2:05:25] hell's angels a bunch of motorcycle gang
[2:05:28] guys a bunch of drug dealers and
[2:05:30] everything and and there's all kinds of
[2:05:32] perversion going on men with men and all
[2:05:34] this crazy stuff
[2:05:36] and there and they're just over there
[2:05:38] and they're in my house and boy they're
[2:05:41] good and pretty soon i see the horns
[2:05:43] starting to show up and the little tails
[2:05:46] starting to stick out and pitchforks in
[2:05:48] their hands and everything and and all
[2:05:51] of a sudden it's just swooping in on me
[2:05:53] and they're saying come on
[2:06:00] chills came over my body
[2:06:04] i went into the kitchen
[2:06:06] and i i remember i went over to the
[2:06:08] stove
[2:06:09] and and
[2:06:10] i i opened the oven door and turned on
[2:06:13] the oven and jumped up
[2:06:15] on the top of the stove and i sitting on
[2:06:17] the stove with my feet on the burner
[2:06:20] just trying to get warm
[2:06:24] from the heat of the oven
[2:06:29] what i saw scared the
[2:06:31] the daylights out of me
[2:06:35] and i remember i finally went up
[2:06:38] and
[2:06:39] and you know and then the police raid
[2:06:41] and all this stuff going on and i
[2:06:44] remember finally i just got down on my
[2:06:46] knees i said god help me
[2:06:48] god help me
[2:06:49] i don't know what i am
[2:06:53] but i'm not this
[2:07:01] something was brought to life in me
[2:07:03] you know why god had a seed he had to
[2:07:06] preserve
[2:07:08] he had a plan and a purpose that he
[2:07:10] couldn't fail because he couldn't think
[2:07:13] it he couldn't prophesy it and not have
[2:07:16] it come to pass and if your names are
[2:07:18] written on the lamb's book of life
[2:07:20] there's no way it can't come to pass
[2:07:26] that's why the blood came
[2:07:29] for a purpose
[2:07:32] only for those whose names were written
[2:07:34] on the lamb's book of life
[2:07:36] what a resting place
[2:07:39] what a covering
[2:07:42] what a restitution
[2:07:44] what a price that's been paid
[2:07:48] and the seed of god is actually placed
[2:07:51] in us
[2:07:53] from the foundations of the world
[2:07:55] and when that light first strikes that
[2:07:58] seed
[2:07:59] it brings to life
[2:08:01] and
[2:08:02] but the light has to come
[2:08:06] upon the seed
[2:08:10] jump over to paragraph
[2:08:16] 42.
[2:08:25] you guys go home if you'd like is a
[2:08:26] wonderful book to read
[2:08:30] moses being born with this great gift of
[2:08:33] faith
[2:08:34] then he was anointed and commissioned at
[2:08:37] the burning bush to deliver god's people
[2:08:41] now see what these great qualities
[2:08:43] now see what great qualities this man
[2:08:46] had
[2:08:48] he was born for a certain thing
[2:08:51] god had
[2:08:53] purpose in it
[2:08:56] god has purpose
[2:08:58] of you being here
[2:09:01] see if you could only be
[2:09:05] get to that place
[2:09:07] how much trouble you would save god and
[2:09:10] yourself too
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:14] so this is what we've been preaching
[2:09:16] about from things that are debated this
[2:09:18] morning we're trying to get to that
[2:09:22] purpose
[2:09:23] never before
[2:09:28] in our lives of christians
[2:09:33] have we ever had a desire to know what
[2:09:35] the purpose
[2:09:37] that god has for our life
[2:09:39] or
[2:09:41] if the question may not be that way
[2:09:44] it may be posed in our heart a different
[2:09:47] way it's in our heart it's a hunger to
[2:09:50] do something for god
[2:09:54] at 56 years old the prophet of god said
[2:09:57] i i'm 56 now he says if i'm ever going
[2:10:01] to do anything for god i better get
[2:10:03] going
[2:10:09] really
[2:10:11] i don't got a chance
[2:10:14] no what was that
[2:10:16] it was a reflection
[2:10:19] of the hour
[2:10:20] he was reflecting what the bride's
[2:10:22] coming into she's going to have such a
[2:10:25] desire in her heart to obtain the
[2:10:27] purpose to come to a realization and the
[2:10:31] understanding of what the predestinated
[2:10:34] thoughts
[2:10:35] are for their particular lives
[2:10:39] that there's such a deep inside of them
[2:10:41] calling that when they hear these things
[2:10:44] my life has been pre-planned
[2:10:46] the blood was only given because my name
[2:10:49] was on the lamb's book of life god
[2:10:51] created me for a purpose and if i could
[2:10:53] find that place and find that purpose i
[2:10:56] would save myself and god a lot of
[2:10:59] trouble
[2:11:04] well god
[2:11:06] believe me he'd like to see us mature
[2:11:08] to the point he has to not shut in every
[2:11:10] door on us he's not crushing us all the
[2:11:13] time he's not chastising us all the time
[2:11:19] he'd surely like to move us up into a
[2:11:21] deeper greater relationship
[2:11:27] i'd much rather preach the wonderful
[2:11:29] riches of christ
[2:11:32] than preach against all the sinners in
[2:11:34] the world
[2:11:41] god has a purpose
[2:11:43] of you being here
[2:11:46] now reflect on that a minute
[2:11:50] he's got a purpose
[2:11:55] and and i wrote this note down
[2:11:58] so i'm going to read it because it just
[2:12:00] he says
[2:12:02] i put this down
[2:12:03] it really moved my heart
[2:12:06] it said just trying to live as a
[2:12:08] christian in this world is just survival
[2:12:17] we're not survivalists
[2:12:21] you understand we're not survivalists
[2:12:25] we are more than survivalists
[2:12:28] we are conquerors
[2:12:34] this isn't where god dumped us off on
[2:12:36] some island somewhere
[2:12:42] you know and you're supposed to use your
[2:12:44] self-survival skills
[2:12:49] right isn't that what survivalist is i
[2:12:51] mean i get these
[2:12:52] things in the mail you know it says
[2:12:55] uh
[2:12:56] you better have two years of survival
[2:12:59] food packed up i just have some just
[2:13:02] happened to have some to sell you
[2:13:06] you know
[2:13:07] here's the one knife if there's if
[2:13:10] you're not left with anything else in
[2:13:12] the world this knife will get you
[2:13:14] through you know it i mean i'll just
[2:13:15] have tim make me a knife i'll have him
[2:13:17] pray over and he'll be anointed it'd do
[2:13:19] a lot better and some survival knife has
[2:13:22] got a can opener on it and a little saw
[2:13:24] on it and a little blade on it so it's
[2:13:27] great if you have to meet the cut and
[2:13:29] the bottle opener to open and
[2:13:32] something to saw
[2:13:34] and boy this is survival survival
[2:13:36] survival survival i don't want to
[2:13:38] survive
[2:13:40] i'm past surviving
[2:13:46] i'm redeemed
[2:13:48] i am redeemed
[2:13:50] by the blood of the lamb
[2:13:52] because my name was on his book
[2:13:57] amen
[2:13:58] think of it
[2:14:00] so as we're reading he said so i put see
[2:14:03] we're not we're conquerors
[2:14:06] we're here to free our brothers and
[2:14:08] sisters from the prisons and chains of
[2:14:10] the enemy and bring life and truth
[2:14:17] let's just finish reading and then we'll
[2:14:19] have billy lead us in some worship
[2:14:24] he says
[2:14:25] and i think
[2:14:26] this is paragraph
[2:14:28] 45.
[2:14:30] i think any man
[2:14:32] with or woman boy or girl
[2:14:36] and i think
[2:14:38] in intellectual conception
[2:14:41] of what they think the word is
[2:14:44] and so forth
[2:14:46] can
[2:14:47] never can have a full foundation
[2:14:51] until they meet
[2:14:53] have meant
[2:14:54] that light
[2:14:55] to bring that word to reality
[2:15:03] so satan gets his bride through science
[2:15:05] education and civilization
[2:15:08] god brings his word into existence by
[2:15:11] hearing and making contact
[2:15:14] with the light
[2:15:20] i think paragraph 46 i think no church
[2:15:26] in its practice
[2:15:28] no matter how intellectual
[2:15:30] and how fundamental it might be
[2:15:34] that church cannot thrive
[2:15:36] until the supernatural is made known
[2:15:40] among that people
[2:15:42] and they see it
[2:15:44] something that they can talk to
[2:15:48] that will talk back to them
[2:15:50] that a vindication
[2:15:54] this
[2:15:55] is
[2:15:56] written
[2:15:57] word
[2:16:00] now
[2:16:02] that's what we're talking about right
[2:16:05] because no church
[2:16:07] nobody of believers
[2:16:10] can thrive
[2:16:12] and really be what he is and move to
[2:16:15] perfection until we totally come to the
[2:16:18] realization and understanding that there
[2:16:21] is a supernatural presence that can move
[2:16:24] in us
[2:16:29] until each of us takes our place and
[2:16:32] purpose realizing that this is what
[2:16:35] you're called to do the works that i do
[2:16:38] shall you do also
[2:16:40] no not everybody's a healer not
[2:16:42] everybody prays for the sin but
[2:16:44] everybody can make contact
[2:16:53] and we can't let that down
[2:16:58] and that context personal
[2:17:02] i can tell you all day long how god
[2:17:04] contacted me
[2:17:06] but you
[2:17:07] climbing up on a roof
[2:17:10] and reading romans 1 won't do it for you
[2:17:16] desperation drove me there
[2:17:19] i hope you don't have to come to
[2:17:21] desperation
[2:17:23] i don't hope you have to be at the edge
[2:17:25] of suicide in the edge of losing your
[2:17:27] mind and going totally crazy and not
[2:17:30] knowing why you're here and what purpose
[2:17:32] you have and why you're living and
[2:17:34] sitting there i don't want to live no
[2:17:35] more i can't take this i i don't know
[2:17:38] nothing raise the catholic there was
[2:17:39] nothing there
[2:17:44] a guy yelled at me why don't you read
[2:17:45] the bible
[2:17:48] like if you're going to be so religious
[2:17:50] mocking me
[2:17:55] i said i'm done with drugs
[2:17:57] well why don't you just
[2:17:59] have we call them joints or
[2:18:02] reefers or you know marijuana's here why
[2:18:04] don't you just have one more
[2:18:05] smoke with us
[2:18:08] okay i'll i'll do
[2:18:10] one more
[2:18:12] so they come back an hour later and
[2:18:15] they've got one this big
[2:18:19] and this big around
[2:18:23] it was a two kilo joint
[2:18:26] you know if you had to hold the thing
[2:18:27] like this
[2:18:28] what was it
[2:18:30] it was mockery
[2:18:32] they thought it was funny
[2:18:34] i'm tore up
[2:18:36] i don't know where to go i don't even
[2:18:38] know what life's about
[2:18:40] i'm screaming inside
[2:18:46] and then i got on a rooftop
[2:18:48] and i read romans 1
[2:18:50] and there they were
[2:18:53] truce breakers liar incontinent
[2:18:56] doing that which was unseemly
[2:18:59] god giving them over to a reprobate mind
[2:19:02] and it could and incontinent and just as
[2:19:06] i read down there i thought oh god what
[2:19:08] was happening
[2:19:10] what was happening
[2:19:15] the word
[2:19:17] was manifesting
[2:19:20] in reality
[2:19:23] i'm finishing up now
[2:19:26] i i never got to what i really was
[2:19:28] preaching about and i don't know what i
[2:19:29] have been preaching about but i think
[2:19:31] it's good
[2:19:35] now let's go to paragraph 48
[2:19:39] moses knew this
[2:19:42] intellectually
[2:19:45] and the seed that was born in him
[2:19:49] was laying in his heart
[2:19:51] and he tried
[2:19:54] through his intellectual experience with
[2:19:56] the word
[2:19:57] he tried to bring
[2:19:59] them out
[2:20:01] to deliver them because he knew he was
[2:20:04] born for that purpose
[2:20:06] he knew that the time the scriptures
[2:20:09] all said that
[2:20:12] had already been there for 400 years
[2:20:16] and just as we know now
[2:20:19] as a man asked me a few minutes ago
[2:20:22] about the coming and the rapture we know
[2:20:26] we're living
[2:20:27] we've lived in the time
[2:20:31] we've lived the time out
[2:20:35] at the time of the rapture is at hand
[2:20:38] and we're looking for a rapturing faith
[2:20:41] that can pull the church together
[2:20:44] and give it some supernatural strength
[2:20:48] that can change these bodies that we're
[2:20:50] living in
[2:20:55] all right
[2:20:56] so now we're positioned
[2:21:01] now we know okay we're here for a
[2:21:03] purpose right
[2:21:05] we're here to be the manifestation of
[2:21:07] the resurrection
[2:21:09] we're here to be made the word flesh
[2:21:12] and we're here to get a hold of a
[2:21:14] supernatural something
[2:21:17] that will change our bodies
[2:21:22] i'll just read these paragraphs he says
[2:21:24] when we see god that can raise the dead
[2:21:26] off the floor or out of the yard and
[2:21:28] bring him back to life again and present
[2:21:30] him before us when we see god who can
[2:21:34] take a cancer that's eaten a man to the
[2:21:37] shadow and raise him up to be strong
[2:21:40] healthy strong man
[2:21:41] that ought to give us rapturing faith in
[2:21:44] the people when we can see a god save
[2:21:47] our sister's toe the blood gets flowing
[2:21:50] down there and they don't have to lose
[2:21:52] it that ought to start giving us
[2:21:53] rapturing faith it ought to start making
[2:21:56] us realize we're called
[2:21:59] our names are on the lamb's book of life
[2:22:01] that's why the blood come in the first
[2:22:03] place
[2:22:07] i have a purpose in life he planned my
[2:22:10] life
[2:22:11] there's a purpose of the enemies out
[2:22:14] there to put the pressure on me to test
[2:22:16] me to bring me to perfection and now
[2:22:19] here i am and what i'm supposed to be
[2:22:22] desiring is that i can make contact
[2:22:29] moses heard it
[2:22:31] and he believed it
[2:22:33] but he didn't make contact well don't go
[2:22:36] down in the dumps
[2:22:38] if you say well i haven't really had a
[2:22:40] contact you know what say praise god
[2:22:44] if i haven't got a contact i've got a
[2:22:46] predestinate prophesied contact coming
[2:22:54] don't let satan twist it
[2:22:58] with psychology and education and
[2:23:00] civilization and temptation
[2:23:06] just because you're drawn away with the
[2:23:08] lust of the flesh doesn't change what
[2:23:10] you are or who you are
[2:23:14] if you haven't made contact it's okay
[2:23:17] that's right
[2:23:19] you say why
[2:23:21] because your contact
[2:23:23] isn't what puts your name book of life
[2:23:26] it's your name being on the book of life
[2:23:29] that's why the blood came because your
[2:23:31] name is on the book of life and he
[2:23:33] didn't put your name on the book of life
[2:23:36] he didn't come down and get the blood to
[2:23:38] cover your sins without also prophesying
[2:23:41] for you a contact
[2:23:46] because he has got
[2:23:48] to bring the word to life
[2:23:53] so no matter where you are in your life
[2:23:56] no matter what decision
[2:23:59] our life is based on
[2:24:02] hearing the word and then making contact
[2:24:08] it's always that way
[2:24:11] when i'm pouting and crying and thinking
[2:24:14] the world's gonna end you know what i
[2:24:15] need to do i need to make contact
[2:24:21] i'm laying there discouraging what am i
[2:24:24] gonna do you know how i'm gonna fight
[2:24:25] this
[2:24:28] david didn't walk up to goliath and
[2:24:30] figure out how he's going to fight him
[2:24:33] he walked up there sad the king of
[2:24:35] israel
[2:24:37] i just had a prophet anoint me with oil
[2:24:39] man i'm excited i'm stoked
[2:24:46] who is this uncircumcised philistine
[2:24:48] that defies the army of the living god
[2:24:51] hallelujah
[2:24:54] i'll fight him
[2:24:58] he walks up to that old giant that says
[2:24:59] hey mr giant
[2:25:02] how are you
[2:25:08] the giant says you little twerp
[2:25:13] don't they have a man in israel
[2:25:16] to send out
[2:25:18] they had a god in israel
[2:25:23] he wasn't facing a man he was facing a
[2:25:26] god
[2:25:26] [Music]
[2:25:30] so here he is
[2:25:33] he's looking at it
[2:25:35] oh there's so many things in this book
[2:25:36] about how pharaoh looked at him as mud
[2:25:38] daubers and all that's a great book
[2:25:40] great tape if you really want to be
[2:25:42] blessed go listen to why christ be
[2:25:44] okay so he looks at him david wasn't
[2:25:47] there david was
[2:25:49] was
[2:25:51] he knew that that giant couldn't win
[2:25:56] he knew he couldn't win
[2:25:58] he'd seen god win
[2:26:01] then he gets up there and he just
[2:26:03] testified
[2:26:05] that was the enemy
[2:26:08] bringing opposition
[2:26:10] to tests
[2:26:14] and and
[2:26:16] that's that opposition
[2:26:19] because one of the greatest responses
[2:26:21] that's the message i want to preach was
[2:26:23] the great responses of the bible but
[2:26:25] i'll i'll work on it more and save it
[2:26:28] but look at the response that came out
[2:26:30] of david
[2:26:31] god delivered the line into my hand
[2:26:34] god delivered the bear into my hand and
[2:26:37] god this day is going to deliver you you
[2:26:40] uncircumcised philistine who defies the
[2:26:43] army of the living god
[2:26:48] it it it bubbles up
[2:26:51] you you need that contact
[2:26:56] i think i just
[2:26:58] laid in his heart
[2:27:00] this great
[2:27:03] and i i think that we're finishing 48
[2:27:05] and we'll read a little bit and we'll go
[2:27:07] experience with the word he says he
[2:27:09] tried through an intellectual experience
[2:27:12] of work
[2:27:12] and tried to bring them out
[2:27:14] to deliver because he knowed he was born
[2:27:17] for that purpose
[2:27:20] you see what he already had settled in
[2:27:22] his heart
[2:27:24] he was born for a purpose
[2:27:27] and you may make mistakes you may try
[2:27:29] things you may struggle but believe me
[2:27:31] god's with you
[2:27:34] the scripture said that they were
[2:27:35] already been
[2:27:37] where they had already been 400 years so
[2:27:39] he says now we know as a man asked me a
[2:27:42] few minutes ago about the coming of the
[2:27:44] rapture we know we're living and time
[2:27:46] has run out the rapture is him we're
[2:27:48] looking for the rapturing faith
[2:27:51] that can pull the church together and
[2:27:53] give it some supernatural strength that
[2:27:55] can change these bodies that we're
[2:27:57] living in
[2:28:00] is that right
[2:28:03] so
[2:28:03] and then he said he said
[2:28:05] and i'll go back to 45 and i think any
[2:28:08] man or woman
[2:28:10] boy or girl and i think in the
[2:28:13] intellectual conception
[2:28:15] of what they think the word is
[2:28:18] so
[2:28:19] forth they can never have full
[2:28:21] foundation to stand on until they meet
[2:28:24] the light that brings that word to
[2:28:28] reality
[2:28:30] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7.
[2:28:38] it shall be light
[2:28:40] in the evening time
[2:28:42] they'll never have the foundation never
[2:28:44] until they come to the meet the light
[2:28:47] that brings it to the reality
[2:28:49] and i and i know because i've got kids
[2:28:52] that went to church and the only reason
[2:28:55] they went to church is because i made
[2:28:57] them
[2:29:00] now matthew's going to preach tonight in
[2:29:02] the front of the church but i remember
[2:29:04] the days he sat on the back row
[2:29:10] because he was running around all night
[2:29:16] you know
[2:29:17] and you know davey he'd be there
[2:29:21] jumping up trying to catch wasps
[2:29:24] in church you know what i mean and and
[2:29:27] and
[2:29:28] he's not there
[2:29:31] they're everywhere
[2:29:33] but what
[2:29:35] what's your hope
[2:29:39] your names
[2:29:41] are written
[2:29:42] your hope is they'll come from across
[2:29:44] the light
[2:29:46] and for everybody that you sit here and
[2:29:48] your parents believe the message and
[2:29:50] you're stuck in the message church and
[2:29:52] this is your religion
[2:29:54] just for one moment
[2:29:57] just say lord we listen to tapes
[2:30:00] let me see the light
[2:30:04] that preach these tapes
[2:30:07] let me see the spirit
[2:30:11] that
[2:30:12] does all these works that i see
[2:30:15] let me feel the anointing that caused
[2:30:18] these testimonies
[2:30:20] let me make contact
[2:30:25] because we're growing in the word
[2:30:29] we're growing in the knowledge of the
[2:30:32] word
[2:30:33] but where we're lacking is in the
[2:30:35] contact
[2:30:40] the personal contact
[2:30:42] the individual everyday contact
[2:30:46] that we need
[2:30:56] we see god can raise the dead we've seen
[2:30:58] that yes there's got to be something
[2:31:00] that happens this is backed up that
[2:31:02] paragraph
[2:31:03] he he says that when the light flashes
[2:31:06] from the sky and the trump sounds
[2:31:10] the body of christ shall be quickened
[2:31:12] together and changed in a moment and
[2:31:14] taking into heaven
[2:31:17] yes there's got to be something like
[2:31:19] that happen
[2:31:21] and our schools of theology can never
[2:31:23] produce that
[2:31:25] yet the intellectually are all right
[2:31:28] but you've got to meet that light
[2:31:31] you've got to find that something
[2:31:39] and
[2:31:40] moses
[2:31:42] based his great call upon the word
[2:31:46] and it was great
[2:31:47] until one day he meant that light
[2:31:50] and the very word itself spoke back to
[2:31:53] him
[2:31:54] then he got his anointing
[2:31:56] that anointed what he had in him
[2:32:00] on the inside
[2:32:04] amen
[2:32:05] it anointed what he had in him
[2:32:08] on the inside
[2:32:12] so i know each of us has a purpose
[2:32:15] and it's easy for you to look at me and
[2:32:17] think well you're a pastor your church
[2:32:20] you've got your purpose no
[2:32:25] i work because i believe but there may
[2:32:27] be a greater purpose in my life wait but
[2:32:30] on this
[2:32:34] it may be to pray for one soul it may be
[2:32:37] but it's got to be a hunger and then
[2:32:39] thirst for that purpose
[2:32:41] there's no big eyes that will use
[2:32:44] achievements aren't measured here
[2:32:46] they're only measured in your personal
[2:32:48] relationship with jesus christ and what
[2:32:51] you believe in fulfilling what you feel
[2:32:53] he has for you to do
[2:32:56] and moses is great calling the word
[2:32:58] and
[2:33:00] until one day he meant the light and the
[2:33:02] very word itself spoke back to him and
[2:33:05] he got his anointing the anointed that
[2:33:07] was it was on the inside of him the
[2:33:10] intellectual that believed it
[2:33:12] the faith that was based up upon his
[2:33:15] belief in god
[2:33:17] that separated him from his mother and
[2:33:20] now when it strikes in the presence of
[2:33:22] the light it anointed that he believed
[2:33:26] what an anointing
[2:33:28] and he was commissioned
[2:33:30] and i have some more belief but i think
[2:33:32] we'll just stop
[2:33:35] there if you go back in and
[2:33:37] uh i'll just let me read this one more
[2:33:40] paragraph here paragraph 65
[2:33:43] that's what the world needs today
[2:33:45] that's what the church needs today
[2:33:48] that's what everyone needs that son and
[2:33:51] daughter of god
[2:33:52] in order to be that you need a personal
[2:33:56] contact say something
[2:33:58] no matter you know the word is true
[2:34:01] you know what's right but then when it
[2:34:04] contacts
[2:34:06] and then you see the things done
[2:34:09] then you know
[2:34:11] you're on the right road and watch
[2:34:14] it always will be spiritual
[2:34:17] it stands right with the scriptures
[2:34:20] because
[2:34:21] this did
[2:34:24] if you get a chance go back
[2:34:28] and
[2:34:29] and read it
[2:34:30] but
[2:34:34] we're maturing
[2:34:37] we're coming into perfection
[2:34:40] the world is part of our perfection
[2:34:45] it's part of our test it's part of our
[2:34:47] trying
[2:34:48] but we can't lose focus
[2:34:51] on the great individual reality
[2:34:55] that
[2:34:55] we each need contact with god
[2:35:00] not one contact
[2:35:04] we need a life of contact
[2:35:09] because the enemy is like a roaring lion
[2:35:13] going about seeking whom he may devour
[2:35:17] he there was two hundred thousand
[2:35:20] thousand demons
[2:35:22] loosed at the river euphrates upon the
[2:35:25] bride
[2:35:28] those spirits
[2:35:30] went out to work on musicians
[2:35:34] artists
[2:35:36] film makers
[2:35:38] music directors politicians
[2:35:42] talk show hosts
[2:35:45] educators
[2:35:47] coaches
[2:35:49] every place of influence
[2:35:52] promoting their kingdom
[2:35:57] but we're not just survivors
[2:36:00] we're conquerors
[2:36:03] when we find our purpose we become a
[2:36:05] mighty army
[2:36:08] an army is here to fight
[2:36:11] and what we're here to fight for is
[2:36:12] we're here to fight to get every single
[2:36:16] one of our kinsmen
[2:36:18] back
[2:36:21] no matter where they are
[2:36:23] how deep and troubled they are
[2:36:25] how bad and sin they are
[2:36:28] how lost they are how mentally disturbed
[2:36:32] they are
[2:36:36] we've got a purpose
[2:36:38] go into all the world
[2:36:40] and preach the gospel
[2:36:42] ye are my witnesses
[2:36:45] that i can do
[2:36:48] through you exceedingly and abundantly
[2:36:51] even above what you can ask or think
[2:36:54] i'll be with you
[2:36:56] even in you
[2:36:58] till the end
[2:37:01] when you read why christ speak
[2:37:03] you see the great
[2:37:06] god
[2:37:07] and how that
[2:37:08] he
[2:37:10] was developed and
[2:37:12] and and how that he come forth
[2:37:16] and
[2:37:18] and
[2:37:18] you can go back and read it and there's
[2:37:20] so many lessons in there
[2:37:23] but i like this one statement here and
[2:37:25] i'm not going to read this statement
[2:37:28] but i'm going to see
[2:37:29] what brother branham said here
[2:37:36] and this was in paragraph 71 and 72
[2:37:40] but he said moses knew that he was born
[2:37:43] for that purpose
[2:37:45] and looked out the window and watched
[2:37:47] the hebrews
[2:37:48] as they toiled
[2:37:49] and looked back here in the scriptures
[2:37:52] and said
[2:37:53] and they shall so journey for four
[2:37:55] hundred years
[2:37:57] and i'll bring them out with a mighty
[2:37:59] hand
[2:38:01] and then when he come back after a
[2:38:03] commission anointed
[2:38:05] that he knew he was born
[2:38:08] and his faith looked
[2:38:12] and his faith looked by faith
[2:38:15] he saw those people and knew
[2:38:18] they were children of god
[2:38:21] because the world
[2:38:23] and the word said so
[2:38:25] they wasn't of the world
[2:38:28] and wasn't like the rest of them
[2:38:31] they were different
[2:38:33] they were cranks and fanatics
[2:38:36] to the high glamorous of egypt
[2:38:40] and he was to be the son of pharaoh
[2:38:43] taking the kingdom over next
[2:38:47] but he there was something down in him
[2:38:51] a real faith
[2:38:53] that looked
[2:38:54] not at those things
[2:38:56] the glamour
[2:38:58] that he was
[2:38:59] to inherit
[2:39:01] he looked to the promise of god
[2:39:04] and knew that the time was drawing nigh
[2:39:08] and what that man must have thought of
[2:39:14] i want to talk to him
[2:39:16] with him someday
[2:39:18] when i meet him on the other side
[2:39:21] you say crazy brother no it isn't
[2:39:25] i'm going to meet him by the grace of
[2:39:28] god
[2:39:29] yes sir
[2:39:30] and i'll talk to him someday
[2:39:33] moses himself
[2:39:35] and how i would like to ask him
[2:39:37] just now
[2:39:40] when he
[2:39:41] seen
[2:39:43] his
[2:39:44] preparation
[2:39:48] think of it
[2:39:51] when he's seen
[2:39:54] his preparation
[2:40:02] when i i look back i never
[2:40:04] seen my testimony
[2:40:08] the way i saw it
[2:40:09] after this
[2:40:11] when he's seen
[2:40:13] his preparation
[2:40:15] all you've been through
[2:40:17] everything
[2:40:18] was just god preparing me
[2:40:21] he said i want to talk to moses
[2:40:24] when he's seen his preparation amen
[2:40:28] i believe god's preparing the bride
[2:40:31] i believe he's preparing us for a
[2:40:33] rapture
[2:40:34] i believe there's a maturity and a
[2:40:37] perfection going on i believe one day
[2:40:39] we're going to recognize our preparation
[2:40:42] and we're going to speak
[2:40:44] and go forward god bless you

[2:51:38] hallelujah
[2:51:43] [Music]
[2:51:51] let's pray
[2:51:52] heavenly father lord we fill you in our
[2:51:54] presence this morning
[2:51:56] lord as brother david said you've rode
[2:51:58] out each of our lives
[2:52:00] lord some of us
[2:52:02] maybe would want to rewrite the way that
[2:52:04] we were born or the way that we were
[2:52:05] raised lord maybe through divorced or
[2:52:08] broken homes
[2:52:09] or those that dropped out of schools or
[2:52:11] those that have loved ones passed away
[2:52:14] or there's many things in our life
[2:52:15] father that we might want to be
[2:52:17] different
[2:52:18] lord but it was spoken this morning that
[2:52:20] each thing was planned out lord that it
[2:52:23] would give you glory
[2:52:24] sometimes in the flesh we don't see
[2:52:26] those things
[2:52:27] sometimes we wonder why we've gone down
[2:52:29] a certain path
[2:52:31] and we want to rewrite our mistakes lord
[2:52:33] but that's what you let the blood be
[2:52:35] there for
[2:52:36] lord and we plead the blood lord we ask
[2:52:38] for forgiveness
[2:52:40] for the ways that we were sure with
[2:52:42] people and the ways that lord we cut
[2:52:44] corners and we did things that weren't
[2:52:45] right
[2:52:47] lord we can sit there under a
[2:52:48] condemnation and guilt lord but that
[2:52:50] will never get us anywhere
[2:52:53] father so we just put ourselves under
[2:52:54] your blood lord we want to find your
[2:52:56] purpose for our life
[2:52:58] lord we don't want to always be having a
[2:53:00] pity party and crying lord in our
[2:53:01] mistakes and our failures and the things
[2:53:03] that would just keep us down lord we
[2:53:05] want to speak your word we want to speak
[2:53:07] the truth
[2:53:09] you thought so much of us lord that you
[2:53:10] sent a prophet in this last day that
[2:53:12] would speak your mind and let us know
[2:53:13] how much you love us
[2:53:15] lord we want to be under that cloud of
[2:53:16] love and that cloud of expectation of
[2:53:18] what you had for us
[2:53:20] lord we thank you for all your goodness
