[17:31] common
[17:33] to know that there's Believers around
[17:34] this world that don't have this
[17:36] opportunity

[39:06] it this evening in Jesus precious and
[39:09] wonderful name we pray
[39:12] amen amen Lord bless you this evening
[39:17] but he just want to Fellowship a little
[39:19] bit this evening uh
[39:23] uh
[39:24] I want to uh
[39:26] just read a little something I thought
[39:28] it was a marvelous thing we're going to
[39:31] listen a little bit of a sermon this
[39:34] evening called the Messiah
[39:36] about 34 minutes of the Messiah I was
[39:39] fellowshipping with brother Wade which
[39:41] is nice to have him and Heidi with us
[39:43] and I said you know by the way this is
[39:47] uh just one of those tapes where brother
[39:49] Brown makes
[39:51] just some tremendous observations and
[39:54] statements and I said I don't know what
[39:57] to call it brother white said well
[40:00] sometimes I call them what we call
[40:02] zingers you know he'll just say
[40:05] something it'll just come
[40:07] right at you well this has got some
[40:09] wonderful things in it that you should
[40:12] really be able to grab hold of and be
[40:15] blessed but
[40:17] in the beginning of this message brother
[40:19] Branham
[40:21] talks about uh a circumstance and I
[40:25] thought the conclusion of this
[40:27] circumstance was marvelous
[40:30] because I think it brings balance
[40:32] sometimes to what that we consider as
[40:36] faith
[40:37] we always think that faith is supposed
[40:41] to produce the result that we want
[40:45] you know America's if you would have
[40:47] believed it you know what I mean and you
[40:51] would say uh you know I'm really
[40:53] believed for this and if it didn't come
[40:56] to pass then your your answer to that
[40:59] would be well I must have not had enough
[41:02] faith and Satan uh sometimes beats us
[41:06] down this little story the way that
[41:08] brother Branham ends it uh I think is
[41:11] marvelous I think you can find it
[41:13] Brothers if they can read along but it
[41:17] starts about paragraph five
[41:21] um uh and this is in the Messiah
[41:23] preached in Shreveport
[41:25] uh January 17 1961.
[41:32] and then he says
[41:34] he says now we're happy to be here
[41:37] tonight and see so many out shining
[41:41] faces Harps open just a wonderful time
[41:45] isn't it amen and we are under
[41:50] expectation tonight I am that the Lord
[41:54] will make known to us tonight his power
[41:57] and glory and will show himself to us
[42:03] oh I I want to see him don't you
[42:07] and whether he does
[42:09] or does not
[42:12] then we will believe him just the same
[42:17] I now listen to this story I just left a
[42:20] little woman coming from Germany a few
[42:22] weeks ago
[42:24] she lost a baby
[42:26] and she was standing near in California
[42:29] once
[42:31] were they brought in a a little baby
[42:34] that had been dead
[42:36] died one morning about three or four
[42:40] o'clock
[42:41] the parents had drove all day and it was
[42:44] about three or four or five o'clock yes
[42:47] about six o'clock in the afternoon
[42:51] and the mother sitting back of the car
[42:55] holding this little cold form in her
[42:57] arms and when they came to the place
[43:00] where I was at San Bernardino they took
[43:04] the little baby and brought it to where
[43:06] I was standing
[43:08] and said oh how and I said well how long
[43:13] has the baby been dead and she said
[43:16] since this morning early
[43:18] and I picked up the little cold form it
[43:22] was already stiff and these people
[43:25] standing around I held them in my arms
[43:28] and prayed for to our precious Lord and
[43:33] I felt the baby was getting warm
[43:35] just holding it just a few minutes and
[43:40] it started to kick and cry and I handed
[43:43] it over to the mother now's when you
[43:45] ought to be shouting before he's gone
[43:48] hallelujah amen raised from the dead in
[43:52] our day glory to God
[43:55] hallelujah
[43:58] and I handed it over to the mother
[44:01] so then now see we don't make those
[44:05] things known see
[44:07] the things of it is there's too much
[44:10] glamor today and we're trying to have a
[44:15] big something to advertise something no
[44:19] it's not that at all the world will
[44:22] never receive it anyhow
[44:26] oh my that's hard to believe how you
[44:30] could raise the Dead
[44:31] and they wouldn't receive it that pretty
[44:33] but we know the Story of Lazarus
[44:36] and
[44:37] and he comes
[44:39] he says he comes to the church
[44:43] it's for the church the people of God
[44:46] these great glamorous things don't work
[44:49] in the kingdom of God people going to be
[44:53] surprised when they find out who is the
[44:57] believer and who is not
[45:03] you just can't put definitions on things
[45:06] sure you just got to be so true to your
[45:09] own heart
[45:10] be like it was when John came
[45:13] the first coming of Jesus there was an
[45:17] at the temple and John the Baptist and
[45:20] just a few that really was Believers
[45:23] really received it now we're looking for
[45:27] his coming the little mother standing
[45:30] there
[45:31] her baby died over in Germany her
[45:35] husband's a chaplain and they called up
[45:38] long distance about five times through
[45:40] the day and night to ask me to come
[45:44] so they know that God would raise that
[45:48] little baby up and I said let me go pray
[45:51] and when I prayed I prayed that
[45:54] afternoon then that night
[45:57] and I and I'll show you whether the
[46:00] doctors believe or not when the when she
[46:04] was already given the doctors my book
[46:09] to read I believe called a prophet visit
[46:12] South Africa something like that
[46:15] and she said God will raise the baby up
[46:19] the mother said God will raise the baby
[46:22] up and the baby had been dead for about
[46:25] they know about four or five hours
[46:29] so they got the father's word down to
[46:33] the base where he was and the baby had
[46:36] been dead died in the night and so the
[46:40] doctor said all right I'll tell you what
[46:42] I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back
[46:46] on
[46:46] and he let that baby lay there
[46:49] for two days without with the oxygen
[46:53] turned on waiting and I was over here
[46:57] praying and they was going to fly me
[47:00] across with a jet I could leave here
[47:03] with an army jet and be back the same
[47:06] day to Germany
[47:08] and one morning about daylight I got up
[47:12] and I laid there a little bit
[47:15] directed indirectly I heard something
[47:18] come into the room and I looked and
[47:22] there was something moving in the room
[47:24] and I jumped up and I said Lord what
[47:28] would you have your servant know and
[47:31] said do not rebuke that it's the hand of
[47:35] the Lord see so I got her on the phone
[47:39] and I said
[47:41] no God has called your baby
[47:44] so when so when she came over here to
[47:48] see us the night
[47:50] left her at the house when I left
[47:52] yesterday
[47:54] she said what was it brother Branham
[47:58] my weakness of faith
[48:01] and I said you have great faith
[48:05] you prayed for your baby
[48:08] and you and your husband held on to it
[48:13] held on to it God to raise the baby
[48:17] and he refused to do it
[48:20] because he knows what's best and you
[48:23] still love him
[48:26] that's real faith
[48:32] see Faith isn't based result
[48:36] and you you still
[48:39] he said
[48:41] and he said and you you still love him
[48:44] that's real faith anybody when mountains
[48:49] are moving and things can have faith but
[48:53] let it go backwards one time
[48:56] and see how it works that's when you
[48:59] prove whether you've got faith or not
[49:03] every son that cometh to God must be
[49:06] chastened and tried of God so remember
[49:09] our trials Works patience and patience
[49:12] Works hope and so forth so we just hold
[49:16] on to God whether He blesses us or not
[49:20] we are right there believing him anyhow
[49:24] because he promised it
[49:27] amen a Believer has no choice but to
[49:32] believe
[49:33] and they still love God the weather the
[49:37] because God knows best and they're never
[49:40] shaken by that one bit I thought what a
[49:44] what a real definition of Faith because
[49:47] Satan just Badgers us sometimes because
[49:51] oh I really believe this and it didn't
[49:53] happen and I really believe this and
[49:55] adapt he answered your prayer because he
[49:58] knew where you would be down the road do
[50:01] you believe he knows where you're going
[50:02] to be
[50:03] I believe he predestinated where you're
[50:05] going to believe I believe you're going
[50:07] to love this portion of tape if if it's
[50:10] not maybe necessarily uh the highest
[50:14] technical uh quality of of tape there is
[50:19] uh but it's uh
[50:22] it's um it just got some wonderful
[50:26] statements in it just like that
[50:28] statement that's real faith that that's
[50:32] real faith and it wasn't the faith to
[50:34] produce it was the faith to love God and
[50:37] accept God's Will and still love them
[50:39] that's real Faith so we're gonna we're
[50:42] gonna listen from paragraph 13.
[50:45] and
[50:46] and uh and the tape's called the Messiah
[50:50] and the prophet of God explains what a
[50:53] messiah is what the anointing is at and
[50:56] how it comes and we preached some of
[50:59] this Sunday night when I preached last
[51:02] Sunday night my brother Dennis will be
[51:05] with us this weekend and so but I wanted
[51:08] to go back and and hear have you listen
[51:12] to it so there's a lot in it so if you
[51:15] can just give 34 minutes of uh
[51:18] concentration and I think that you will
[51:21] uh hear some things that are
[51:25] they're just wonderful things that's all
[51:28] I can say the word of God excites me
[51:31] amen the word of God empowers you
[51:34] but everyone's going to talk a little
[51:36] bit about the conductor in this and not
[51:39] the railroad conductor but what conducts
[51:42] the power of God and the anointing of
[51:44] God and I think you'll really love it I
[51:47] think if you take this it'll fortify
[51:49] it'll strong you and you're going to see
[51:52] why this church will rise up with risk
[51:57] with uh life in its wings and the power
[52:01] of the Resurrection to do exceedingly
[52:05] and abundantly what we could ask or
[52:07] think and to have the greater work and
[52:12] that's because of the Messiah or the
[52:15] anointing so we're going to start in our
[52:18] Bibles we go ahead and stand
[52:21] uh John the first chapter the 40th
[52:26] to the 43rd verse and then John the
[52:30] fourth chapter the 24th 25th and 26th
[52:35] verse if you can get it on uh your phone
[52:38] or your tablet and then highlight it as
[52:41] you go I think you'll hear some
[52:44] wonderful things so the prophet of God
[52:46] said I just wanted to teach the church a
[52:49] little bit tonight so let's sit under
[52:51] the teaching of a real real prophet and
[52:56] the voice of God to our generation God
[52:59] bless you I really believe you'll enjoy
[53:00] and then we'll comment a little bit
[53:01] after and Worship the Lord amen God
[53:05] bless you in the reading if you'd like
[53:07] to Market and I've been used the last
[53:09] few weeks to speaking and marking down
[53:12] potions of scriptures now I got about
[53:14] four pages of them here I don't know how
[53:16] to ever get to them but if you'd like to
[53:20] do it while you're more than welcome I
[53:22] think sometimes now that the end is so
[53:24] now I thought maybe I'd just teach a
[53:27] little on the subject
[53:29] you might turn to Saint John the first
[53:32] chapter
[53:33] and we would read the first
[53:36] scripture out of the first chapter and
[53:38] the second scripture reading out of the
[53:40] fourth chapter of Saint John
[53:44] Saint John the first chapter and the
[53:46] 40th verse of the first chapter we read
[53:50] down to the 43rd and the fourth chapter
[53:53] we begin at the 24th 25th and 26th verse
[53:59] first chapter 41st one all the two which
[54:02] heard John speak and followed him was
[54:06] Andrew Simon Peter's brother
[54:09] he first finds his own brother Simon and
[54:12] said unto him we have found the Messiah
[54:15] which is being interpreted the Christ
[54:19] and he brought him to Jesus and when
[54:21] Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon
[54:25] the son of Jonas
[54:27] thou shall be called cephas which is by
[54:31] interpretation a stone
[54:35] and in the 24th verse of the fourth
[54:37] chapter we read this
[54:40] God is a spirit and they that worship
[54:43] Him must
[54:45] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[54:49] the woman said unto him
[54:51] I know that Messiah cometh which is
[54:56] called Christ
[54:57] and when he is come he will tell us all
[55:01] things
[55:02] Jesus said unto her eye that speak unto
[55:05] thee am he
[55:08] I want to take five lettered word from
[55:12] there for a text
[55:15] m-e-s-s-i-s Messiahs
[55:18] I want the subject tonight to be around
[55:21] the word the Messiah
[55:26] the word itself means
[55:29] the anointed one
[55:33] or it could be used the anointed king
[55:38] and
[55:40] and so means Christ
[55:44] but we're going to use it first in this
[55:46] thought of the anointed king
[55:51] it appears first in Genesis 3 15 if you
[55:54] want to put some scriptures down
[55:57] the promised seat of the woman which was
[56:00] to be the anointed one
[56:04] all through the scriptures all the
[56:07] prophets speak of that coming one
[56:10] the United king
[56:14] I like that word Anointed
[56:17] God anointing one
[56:20] and he was to be a king who was the lead
[56:23] Israel
[56:25] to freedom from all the nations and make
[56:29] them rulers over the Nations the
[56:32] anointed king
[56:34] wants to do that
[56:37] I believe that Jesus of Nazareth
[56:41] fulfilled every description that all the
[56:45] prophets spoke of to be the Messiah
[56:48] amen I believe that the Isaiah 9 6 when
[56:53] the
[56:54] that Israel had asked for a sign
[56:58] God said I'll give them an everlasting
[57:01] sign
[57:02] a sign an eternal sign
[57:05] one that would be forever
[57:08] said a virgin shall conceive
[57:11] that'll be a sign
[57:13] and that
[57:15] one that will be born of her
[57:18] his name Shall be Called counselor the
[57:22] Prince of Peace the Mighty God and the
[57:26] Everlasting father
[57:29] and I believe that Jesus met every
[57:33] description of every promise that
[57:36] Jehovah made as the coming King and
[57:40] Messiah
[57:40] [Music]
[57:42] no matter how greatly many believe that
[57:45] he was defeated in his work
[57:47] he still is King
[57:51] he is a king now he's king of saints
[57:56] Revelation says so Thou King of saints
[58:00] he has a kingdom aren't you glad you
[58:03] belong in that Dominion tonight in the
[58:06] Dominion of the anointed one
[58:09] not only that but he's made us Kings and
[58:12] Priests unto God
[58:14] anointed ones
[58:16] unto God
[58:18] now
[58:20] although Jesus meeting all these
[58:23] qualifications
[58:25] and the Jews had read these promises for
[58:28] years how did it ever slip up on them
[58:32] and slip by without them seeing it
[58:35] those theologians so well read in the
[58:39] scriptures
[58:40] so particular about their scriptures and
[58:43] yet they failed to see him to be the
[58:46] anointed one
[58:48] it sounds though it could not have
[58:50] happened
[58:52] looks like they would anoint him so well
[58:55] versed
[58:56] but God blinded their eyes
[59:00] it shows that it was the hand of God
[59:03] he was too plainly known
[59:07] his signs of Messiah proved in to be
[59:10] Messiah proven to be the anointed one
[59:14] and
[59:15] for them to miss it it sure had to be
[59:19] the hand of God to Blind and that they
[59:22] did not miss it are they or where they
[59:24] would not have missed it rather
[59:26] and it's the same thing today
[59:29] if the gospel's hid it's here to them
[59:32] that are blind
[59:34] and the only way that they can receive
[59:37] sight is through God
[59:39] now Isaiah 9 6 we just won't read it but
[59:43] he was to be the
[59:45] Everlasting father
[59:48] the Mighty God
[59:50] [Music]
[59:52] when God made man in Genesis 1 26.
[59:59] it shows that you put that scripture
[1:00:01] down Genesis 1 26 it shows that God made
[1:00:06] man to be a God to begin with
[1:00:10] man was made to be a god
[1:00:13] a Lesser God
[1:00:15] he was made in the image and likeness of
[1:00:18] God
[1:00:19] he had hands like God he had feet like
[1:00:23] God eyes ears and intelligence like God
[1:00:28] this whole fiber because he was a son of
[1:00:32] Gods
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:34] and the Jesus referred to him as God
[1:00:40] Jesus said how can you condemn me saying
[1:00:42] I'm the Son of God isn't it written your
[1:00:44] law that you're God's
[1:00:46] and if they call those Gods who the word
[1:00:48] of God came to you how can you condemn
[1:00:50] me when I say I'm the son of God
[1:00:52] he was referring to the prophets the
[1:00:55] anointed ones
[1:00:57] lest you're anointed
[1:01:00] Jesus
[1:01:01] was so anointed
[1:01:04] that he was more than a prophet
[1:01:07] Jesus is so anointed that he was the
[1:01:10] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:01:13] he was God
[1:01:16] the prophets had the same kind of
[1:01:18] anointing only in a lesser condition
[1:01:21] I am in Genesis 1 26 when God made man
[1:01:24] he made him a God because he gave him a
[1:01:30] Dominion
[1:01:31] and he had rulership
[1:01:34] he had power over the birds of the air
[1:01:37] the cattle over the winds the waves the
[1:01:41] the fishes of the sea the everything he
[1:01:44] had dominion over everything
[1:01:47] he was a ruler
[1:01:49] anointed a ruler
[1:01:52] because he was in the likeness and in
[1:01:55] the image of God with an Earthly domain
[1:02:00] that's why the Bible says the Earth is
[1:02:03] groaning crying waiting for the
[1:02:07] manifestations of the sons of God
[1:02:12] the world is waiting for the man to come
[1:02:15] back into his right estate
[1:02:18] now he is the
[1:02:21] made in the image and likeness of God
[1:02:24] that makes his when God made him God
[1:02:27] give him some of his Spirit part of his
[1:02:29] life and he's in the likeness and the
[1:02:31] image of God
[1:02:33] therefore like
[1:02:35] here in um
[1:02:37] uh man in his natural condition way we
[1:02:41] are now you can see that he's much more
[1:02:43] than an animal as they try to say we are
[1:02:47] because man in his Fallen estate yet
[1:02:51] being a fallen Son of God
[1:02:53] he still can better himself
[1:02:57] he has an intelligence
[1:02:59] he builds himself a better house
[1:03:02] living conditions He makes himself
[1:03:05] better travel conditions he can speed
[1:03:07] himself through the air not 1900 miles
[1:03:09] an hour in a Jet Plane a rocket
[1:03:13] and he's he's made himself so he can
[1:03:15] almost travel around the world just in a
[1:03:18] 24 hours just set a light satellite in
[1:03:22] the air above the space of where the air
[1:03:26] is returning the orbit of the world and
[1:03:29] stands still and watch the world pass
[1:03:32] under him and go completely around in 24
[1:03:34] hours you're standing still at one place
[1:03:36] won't the Aaron stand there come right
[1:03:38] back down and be home again
[1:03:40] you're standing above the revolving
[1:03:43] Earth where the Earth is pulling its
[1:03:46] current around making the winds and so
[1:03:49] forth the current world turning about
[1:03:51] round about close to
[1:03:54] 2500 miles an hour
[1:03:56] no I say about 1100 miles an hour 2500
[1:03:59] miles around it is going around every 24
[1:04:01] hours via bringing 1100 miles an hour
[1:04:04] and he goes up in the air and defies
[1:04:07] that stands above gravitation and stands
[1:04:09] there and watch the world pass around
[1:04:11] Henry
[1:04:12] smart intelligent
[1:04:14] and he's he's made up in the image and
[1:04:18] the likeness of God
[1:04:21] and in him is light
[1:04:24] now for instance when a man gets saved
[1:04:28] he's just about like the light that
[1:04:30] comes into him is about like this little
[1:04:32] white button on my shirt
[1:04:34] that's when God comes into the inner
[1:04:38] part of a man
[1:04:40] in the inner part of a manner a man is
[1:04:42] made up in the system of a tabernacle
[1:04:45] in the outer courts then holy place and
[1:04:49] the holiest of holies the Shekinah Glory
[1:04:52] on the inside the Veil
[1:04:55] now on the outside Gates of a man is his
[1:05:00] five senses that enters to his body
[1:05:03] on the inside which is his soul are the
[1:05:07] the the
[1:05:09] soul is the nature of the spirit that's
[1:05:12] on the inside of his heart produces his
[1:05:14] soul which makes the atmosphere around
[1:05:16] him he has also five entrances
[1:05:20] then on the inside
[1:05:23] he has only one gate one entrance to go
[1:05:27] into the Shekinah Glory where God can
[1:05:31] enter into him and take over in the
[1:05:33] control tower and that way is through
[1:05:35] self-will
[1:05:37] whether you will to or not that's up to
[1:05:39] you but that's the only Avenue that's
[1:05:42] open to the man that God can come into
[1:05:44] his heart is by self-will puts him right
[1:05:47] back like Adam and Eve on three moral
[1:05:49] agency again you can choose right or
[1:05:50] wrong either one you want to
[1:05:52] now self-will then God comes into the
[1:05:56] man
[1:05:56] into the heart which is a spirit then
[1:05:59] the spirit makes the soul and then the
[1:06:02] soul dwells in the body
[1:06:04] now when a man is converted say just
[1:06:06] like that little white button starts in
[1:06:09] his heart
[1:06:10] now that part is God
[1:06:12] God when he's born again with a spirit
[1:06:15] of God God's spirit dwells in him
[1:06:19] now as he can let that Spirit grow and
[1:06:22] take out all the roots of bitterness and
[1:06:25] press God's way through him again he can
[1:06:28] become back in the same condition that
[1:06:31] he was when he was in the Garden of Eden
[1:06:34] Jesus said now in Mark 11 24 verely
[1:06:38] verily I send you if you say to this
[1:06:40] mountain be moved and don't doubt in
[1:06:42] your heart but believe that what you
[1:06:44] have said will come to pass you can have
[1:06:46] what you said
[1:06:48] that puts him right back Supreme again
[1:06:52] puts him right back in the condition now
[1:06:54] we're made up of light meters inside of
[1:06:57] us is Cosmic light
[1:06:59] now that Cosmic light is the light that
[1:07:02] they can take an x-ray with the X-ray
[1:07:04] doesn't come from the X-ray light it
[1:07:06] comes from your own life
[1:07:08] and then if that Cosmic light say it
[1:07:12] could be pushed to a place that we're
[1:07:15] not Cosmic light but
[1:07:17] Eternal Light
[1:07:18] come could dwell supremely to do our
[1:07:23] thinking do our walking do our talking
[1:07:25] that is no longer the man it's God in
[1:07:28] the man
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:07:30] suppose I'm Death In You by this thing
[1:07:32] because I hear it rebound he's got an
[1:07:34] awful voice
[1:07:35] it isn't me it's this I see it lay it on
[1:07:37] to that
[1:07:39] now
[1:07:40] he's got life life
[1:07:43] eternal life is the light of God that
[1:07:45] dwells in the man
[1:07:48] yield to the spirit more he becomes
[1:07:54] unmanned sinner-like and becomes more
[1:07:56] Godlike
[1:07:58] you're not long ago they took an x-ray
[1:08:00] of a man praying for a sick man Reader's
[1:08:03] Digest wrote it up and found out a ray
[1:08:06] of light coming from one of the man not
[1:08:08] all of them but one of the man's hands
[1:08:10] reflected a ray of light when they put a
[1:08:12] piece of lead for her beneath the man's
[1:08:15] hand I guess you read yourself in
[1:08:16] England they turned the healers they
[1:08:18] called them loose to all the hospitals
[1:08:21] it was 80 percent more healing done by
[1:08:23] Divine Healing and medical cures that
[1:08:24] performed
[1:08:25] Reader's Digest picked it up over here
[1:08:27] that was a Newsweek and Reader's Digest
[1:08:30] picked it up and tried it and they find
[1:08:32] that there is a ray of light when this
[1:08:35] man sincerely not knowing they were
[1:08:37] doing him put his hands upon a man and
[1:08:40] pray to earn his prayer this is putting
[1:08:41] the X-ray down and found out a light
[1:08:45] coming from his hand God knew what he
[1:08:47] talked about when he said lay hands on
[1:08:49] the sick and they shall recover he knows
[1:08:54] what he was speaking of
[1:08:57] oh I want to see the church press into
[1:09:00] that place where he can come like God
[1:09:02] wants it to be
[1:09:04] then when God was made flesh and became
[1:09:07] the Messiah
[1:09:09] then if we can yield ourselves to be the
[1:09:13] anointed like he was we become Messiahs
[1:09:17] little lights that's what the church is
[1:09:20] supposed to be light little anointed
[1:09:23] ones
[1:09:24] that's God's Church his standing light
[1:09:28] is the light our Messiah risen Christ in
[1:09:33] his people the anointed ones
[1:09:36] carrying forth his life into all the
[1:09:39] church ages sometimes it almost goes
[1:09:42] completely out then it comes back again
[1:09:45] God's anointed one God's Messiah Church
[1:09:50] if Messiah means the anointed one and
[1:09:54] means king then if the church is
[1:09:56] Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it
[1:09:58] becomes a lesser but still a messiah
[1:10:01] because it has his light reflecting his
[1:10:05] power reflecting his glory reflecting
[1:10:08] his Dominion so it is Messiah
[1:10:13] oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in
[1:10:17] his domain
[1:10:18] the troubles today we've organized the
[1:10:21] church to death and we got organizations
[1:10:23] instead of Messiah
[1:10:25] we got russellite proselyte and all
[1:10:28] other kinds of light but we need Messiah
[1:10:30] what the church needs today the light of
[1:10:34] the Messiah
[1:10:37] or loving for his goodness now that is
[1:10:42] true God called
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:46] Messiahs
[1:10:47] God called us and we become Kings and
[1:10:53] Priests unto God
[1:10:56] like Jesus was God's high priest
[1:11:00] we become a lesser priest
[1:11:03] Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him
[1:11:08] the shine forth the expression of God to
[1:11:11] the world for God was in Christ
[1:11:13] reconcile the world to himself
[1:11:16] and his God was in Christ reconcile the
[1:11:18] world to himself God comes into his
[1:11:21] church and anoints him some Messiahs
[1:11:28] the same things he did is in his church
[1:11:31] the same power he had in his church and
[1:11:34] his church becomes of his the Dominion
[1:11:38] and he's King over this dominion and we
[1:11:42] are Kings and Priests offering spiritual
[1:11:44] sacrifices to God the fruits of our lips
[1:11:47] giving praise to his name
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:50] oh my there you are
[1:11:55] Messiahs
[1:11:57] Messiah X
[1:11:58] little Messiahs little anointed ones
[1:12:03] not an awful lot the main one
[1:12:07] anointed all for the great one
[1:12:10] oh when Jesus is on Earth they could not
[1:12:14] deny him being Messiah because he did
[1:12:17] the signs of the Messiah
[1:12:21] the Jews was blinded
[1:12:23] and that's the reason they didn't see
[1:12:25] him and see his signs as Messiah that's
[1:12:28] what's the matter with the church
[1:12:30] tonight it's blinded the outside world
[1:12:34] they can't see it because the God of
[1:12:37] this Earth is blinded their eyes to the
[1:12:39] things that are spiritual
[1:12:42] oh if we could only understand Jesus
[1:12:46] went about and did the signs of the
[1:12:49] Messiah and the people
[1:12:51] blasphemed him and if they blaspheme the
[1:12:55] great anointed king Messiah how much
[1:12:58] more will they call them of his
[1:13:01] household of his kingdom
[1:13:04] beelzebubs and whatever more they called
[1:13:06] him they call you worse than Holy Roller
[1:13:09] holy jumper something another
[1:13:12] they always got a scandal name for it
[1:13:15] because it comes from the Devil
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:20] and they called them out of his
[1:13:22] household he said more than they if they
[1:13:25] called him that what would they call
[1:13:27] them of his household
[1:13:29] but still it makes just the same now you
[1:13:33] say you know brother Branham Jesus had
[1:13:35] the son and Messiah how do we know what
[1:13:38] was the sign
[1:13:39] well when he come the Bible said that
[1:13:42] when the Messiah come he would be a a
[1:13:45] prophet and would show signs of the
[1:13:49] Prophet any Scripture teacher knows that
[1:13:52] Moses said the Lord oh God shall raise
[1:13:54] up for profit like unto me
[1:13:57] and those when he performed those signs
[1:14:00] of showing himself like in the chapter
[1:14:03] four here when he told the woman she had
[1:14:05] five husbands she said sir I foresee
[1:14:08] that thou art a prophet
[1:14:10] we know the when a messiah comes he'll
[1:14:12] tell us all things he said I'm he that
[1:14:15] speaks to him
[1:14:17] she ran into the City and told all the
[1:14:19] men of the city come see a man who told
[1:14:21] me the things I've done isn't this a
[1:14:23] very Messiah
[1:14:26] Jesus said himself if I do not the works
[1:14:29] on my father then believe me not if I
[1:14:33] claim to have the anointing and do not
[1:14:35] the works of God cause I am anointed by
[1:14:37] him
[1:14:38] with him it's not me that doeth the
[1:14:40] works that's the father dwelleth in me
[1:14:43] he doeth the works
[1:14:45] and if I do not them works then don't
[1:14:47] believe me but if I do and believe him
[1:14:50] now that was Pharma Messiah for a
[1:14:54] messiah it's the church here it comes
[1:14:57] are you ready Saint John 14 12 Jesus
[1:15:01] said he that believeth on me the works
[1:15:03] that I do shall he do also Messiah
[1:15:07] that's right Messiah f
[1:15:11] the representation our Messiah on Earth
[1:15:14] yet Mark 16 he said go in all the way
[1:15:17] preach the gospel the sign shall fall
[1:15:22] the Messiah
[1:15:24] he that believeth in his baptized shall
[1:15:26] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:15:28] damned and these signs shall follow them
[1:15:32] that believe
[1:15:33] how far to all the world who too every
[1:15:36] creature
[1:15:38] oh I'm so glad how are you gonna rub the
[1:15:40] house said it just only to the disciples
[1:15:44] to the disciples he said to all the
[1:15:46] world
[1:15:47] and to every creature
[1:15:50] these signs shall follow them that
[1:15:52] believe I wonder where people don't
[1:15:55] believe in signs and wonders found the
[1:15:56] Believers how would you ever read the
[1:15:58] history of the church and think it
[1:16:00] ceased with the apostles
[1:16:01] the church ages I read the Nicene
[1:16:05] fathers and I see counsel all the
[1:16:08] ancient writers I could think of reading
[1:16:09] hosta's two Badlands and many of the
[1:16:11] other ancient books and all the ways
[1:16:15] down to the early Catholic Church down
[1:16:18] for the first 600 years after Christ
[1:16:21] that was ireneous Saint Martin Columbus
[1:16:25] and all of those every one of those
[1:16:28] saintly man they preached the baptism in
[1:16:31] the name of Jesus Christ they preached
[1:16:34] the remission of sins they preached
[1:16:36] speaking in tongues they raised the dead
[1:16:39] they heal the sick signs and wonders
[1:16:41] followed them fall out to the Dark Ages
[1:16:43] Into the Dark Ages
[1:16:44] there's been a little minority all the
[1:16:47] way down keeping that gospel light
[1:16:50] shining
[1:16:52] what was it Messiahs
[1:16:55] once holy forth the representation of
[1:16:58] the Messiah Kingdom
[1:17:01] Jesus never failed
[1:17:03] he did just exactly what he's
[1:17:05] commissioned to do
[1:17:07] and he come to establish a kingdom and
[1:17:10] he did it
[1:17:15] for the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:18] brings God's spirit upon anointed Church
[1:17:22] to perform signs and wonders as he did
[1:17:25] to prove that Messiah is king of his
[1:17:28] kingdom
[1:17:30] amen I feel like shout a little bit
[1:17:32] myself now
[1:17:35] oh when there are so many people
[1:17:40] and come join this and we got the
[1:17:42] biggest we got this we got the most
[1:17:44] expensive what difference does that make
[1:17:47] all of that is folly and we'll perish
[1:17:52] but the kingdom of God is established in
[1:17:55] the heart
[1:17:59] by revelation of Jesus Christ and he set
[1:18:03] up on this rock I'll build my church and
[1:18:07] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:11] up on this revelation
[1:18:15] and to have the Revelation you become a
[1:18:19] Believer and believing these signs shall
[1:18:22] follow them that believe
[1:18:24] you see what Messiah is
[1:18:26] Messiah is the kingdom of God anointed
[1:18:31] ones their minority with the same Spirit
[1:18:34] he was anointed with he once said to him
[1:18:37] one day will my son set the right left
[1:18:39] hand he said can you drink the cup that
[1:18:40] I drink can you be baptized with the
[1:18:43] baptism I'm baptized with she said yay
[1:18:45] and he said you will but the kingdom to
[1:18:48] sit right left hand is not mine to give
[1:18:50] so it showed that we could drink the
[1:18:53] same cup of persecution because whatever
[1:18:57] it might be and still be baptized with
[1:19:00] the same Spirit he's baptized with so if
[1:19:03] he was called Messiah which he was
[1:19:06] because he was anointed with that Holy
[1:19:09] Spirit and any church that's a nausea
[1:19:12] with the same holy spirit is a messiah a
[1:19:15] littler smaller God
[1:19:19] and Sunday when this body is resurrected
[1:19:24] I hope beforehand that God can get a
[1:19:26] hold of a bunch of people that a
[1:19:29] manifest his power and ever the mission
[1:19:32] that is
[1:19:33] supposed to be him

[1:19:43] your Kings and Priests
[1:19:45] came to bring in Priest the minister
[1:19:47] tomb a messiah

[1:19:56] kingdom people now don't you don't have
[1:20:00] to die to get this you have to

[1:21:05] visions get out of here you amalekite
[1:21:07] I'm coming over there you are you're
[1:21:10] pressing out from that little button is
[1:21:12] taking over the fibers of you spreading

[1:21:17] you no wonder Elijah lady's body up on
[1:21:21] that dead baby they come to life it was
[1:21:23] God in that man
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:27] God it took over
[1:21:29] he was anointed Jesus said he was
[1:21:33] every prophet of God in the Old
[1:21:36] Testament was anointed with the Holy
[1:21:38] Ghost
[1:21:39] they were then they were lesser lights
[1:21:42] he was the fullness of God being Messiah
[1:21:45] there it was Messiah at sin smaller
[1:21:48] Messiahs for they were a naughty with
[1:21:51] the same spirit that he was anointed
[1:21:52] with only he had it in the fullness
[1:21:55] and every man today that's received the
[1:21:57] true baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:21:59] Anointed with the same spirit that Jesus
[1:22:01] of Nazareth was it went about doing good
[1:22:03] and Healing The Sick
[1:22:04] foreign
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:09] that makes me feel good
[1:22:12] to know that he lives today
[1:22:16] there's something about a man
[1:22:20] he is a God
[1:22:22] he was made to be a god
[1:22:25] his purpose you're on Earth was to be a
[1:22:27] God to have a dominion over everything
[1:22:30] in the Earth
[1:22:32] oh my God don't let that stagger you
[1:22:35] because I got some more scriptures go
[1:22:36] down here
[1:22:39] here the other night
[1:22:41] I saw on a telecast
[1:22:44] of the name of psychic mental faith
[1:22:48] said a glass of water and stood back and
[1:22:51] kept concentrating on that glass of
[1:22:53] water until they bursted it just the
[1:22:55] concentration what's in that glass of
[1:22:57] water and the glass cracked in the water
[1:22:59] run out this pure mental consecration
[1:23:03] why that's his fibers that's his makeup
[1:23:07] if he can do that got a power in him by
[1:23:10] mental thinking that can break a glass
[1:23:13] of water in him being a sinner that
[1:23:16] shows that there was something made in
[1:23:18] that man he's in a fallen Fallen
[1:23:20] perverted condition but if that man can
[1:23:24] only get back to God and let God get
[1:23:28] into him why would that power turn loose
[1:23:32] of the kingdom of God he didn't have no
[1:23:34] conductor he was like a shotgun he just
[1:23:36] splattered everlane but if that Spirit
[1:23:39] that's in a man could be converted and
[1:23:42] put Christ in there okay where he's got
[1:23:45] a conductor a conductory is a wire that
[1:23:47] conducts it
[1:23:49] amen and let a man in with that same
[1:23:52] faith in the conductor of the word of
[1:23:54] God he can raise a dead pencil after his
[1:23:57] cast out Devils amen
[1:24:02] he's fashioned like a god he looks like
[1:24:04] God
[1:24:06] sure was that's reason God was man man
[1:24:08] was God
[1:24:10] and this is his offspring's man
[1:24:13] he's only trying to get a hold of man
[1:24:15] trying to get man into his hand
[1:24:18] now
[1:24:19] not conductors not at all theology is
[1:24:22] the right kind of conductor you know
[1:24:25] there's a lot of theologies as an
[1:24:27] insulator in front of it
[1:24:29] got loud churches says the days of
[1:24:31] Miracles is passing no such thing as
[1:24:32] Divine Healing on the devil speak in
[1:24:34] tongues now that's an insulator
[1:24:36] you don't want nothing like that get
[1:24:37] away from that
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:40] the word is God's conductor
[1:24:43] a man that believes in God's word has
[1:24:46] God's word stands as high as these
[1:24:48] buildings around here when he walks out
[1:24:49] on it it's a boss
[1:24:52] it conducts the man it conducts the
[1:24:54] spirit
[1:24:55] when in Thailand's made up to have a
[1:24:57] great faith what makes a priests here at
[1:24:59] this Tabernacle some time ago on
[1:25:01] thirsting for life
[1:25:03] what makes a woman want to get out here
[1:25:06] and rock and roll what makes a boy a
[1:25:08] young teenage kid want to do that and
[1:25:10] not only that but Grandpa and Grandma
[1:25:11] what are they doing for her what makes
[1:25:14] him go out here why does people want to
[1:25:15] act the way they do it's because they
[1:25:18] were made the first for something
[1:25:21] and they was made to thirst but the
[1:25:24] thirst after God
[1:25:26] and they're trying to hush that Holy
[1:25:29] Thirst by letting the devil power what
[1:25:31] he calls Pleasures on it
[1:25:33] you'll never never satisfy until God
[1:25:36] comes in and takes control
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:40] You Can Dance you can drink you can
[1:25:43] commit adultery you can do whatever you
[1:25:45] want to and you'll wake up headache and
[1:25:47] someday in hell
[1:25:50] but the reason you do that is because
[1:25:52] you were made in the image of God the
[1:25:54] thirst after God
[1:25:56] couples to get in there
[1:25:58] almost let his word come into you and
[1:26:00] use it as a conductor God said so like
[1:26:03] Abraham God said you're going to have a
[1:26:05] baby I know you're going to have it God
[1:26:07] said so you're 100 years old how can you
[1:26:10] have it God said so
[1:26:12] he was anointed hey man he was anointed
[1:26:17] and he had the word and the Word was the
[1:26:19] Lord
[1:26:20] and it was a conductor to leading to the
[1:26:22] baby
[1:26:23] amen or woman tonight or take that same
[1:26:25] word of God by stripes we were healed
[1:26:29] let the anointing the Messiah come upon
[1:26:31] you
[1:26:32] that conductor leads you right straight
[1:26:34] to your healing
[1:26:36] salvation
[1:26:38] oh
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:44] they The Thirst made for God and the
[1:26:47] devil tries to pervert you make you I
[1:26:49] think you're having a good time out here
[1:26:50] keep you blinded like he does did the
[1:26:53] Jews until the time that you cross a
[1:26:55] separating line and then you're finished
[1:26:57] it's by word this nation is today and
[1:27:00] not only this and but others
[1:27:02] the world won't believe it
[1:27:04] the Bible said in second Timothy 3. that
[1:27:08] in the last station that they would be
[1:27:10] heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:27:12] more than lovers of God truce Breakers
[1:27:14] false accusers incontinent and despisers
[1:27:17] of those that are
[1:27:19] Messiahs
[1:27:22] treaty heady high-minded lovers of
[1:27:25] pleasure more than Lover's God having a
[1:27:27] farm of godliness
[1:27:28] don't you never look for this big high
[1:27:30] type evangelism a thing to do anything
[1:27:31] that's not God's way of doing it
[1:27:34] he came to his own his own received
[1:27:36] enough
[1:27:38] he was small he didn't why he lived out
[1:27:41] there in Palestine all of his life
[1:27:42] you're in I'll say 80 percent of people
[1:27:44] never know he was there
[1:27:46] but he sent to the church he was sent to
[1:27:49] the people that he was going to receive
[1:27:51] he wrote his own his own knows him my
[1:27:54] sheep know my voice
[1:27:56] don't let that go over Shreveport please
[1:27:58] hold that
[1:28:00] my sheep know my voice by my word my
[1:28:03] word if it's taught and don't declare
[1:28:05] the same thing that I did that's the
[1:28:07] wrong conductor
[1:28:10] besideship so where's the eagle is we
[1:28:13] know that and um how we say in the man's
[1:28:16] the man for I'll leave that subject
[1:28:19] the man what is he
[1:28:22] he's got a hand like God
[1:28:25] eyes like God
[1:28:27] got ears like God
[1:28:29] got a body like God
[1:28:35] what'd you think
[1:28:38] Hallelujah
[1:28:40] amen little Messiah
[1:28:43] Hallelujah why because you're annoying
[1:28:46] it
[1:28:47] why the conductor
[1:28:51] leads you right to the Fountain the word
[1:28:55] inside of you what a wonderful
[1:28:59] wonderful
[1:29:01] glorious thing
[1:29:03] that we have that God has for us
[1:29:06] something that that is in you it's like
[1:29:10] I love it it's just like that button it
[1:29:12] just grows up and the more that you
[1:29:14] clean out and the more you get rid of
[1:29:16] unbelief and the more the more that he
[1:29:18] comes in
[1:29:20] the more that he anoints you with the
[1:29:22] same anointing he has the works that I
[1:29:25] do you shall do also
[1:29:27] it's your fiber but wasn't that
[1:29:30] something about that man being able to
[1:29:32] break the glass
[1:29:34] he said if he could do that with mental
[1:29:36] power
[1:29:38] what what do you think you could do with
[1:29:40] the right mental attitude towards every
[1:29:42] word of God that you clay claim on that
[1:29:45] that's me I'm a Believer I I am oh
[1:29:50] why we're almost afraid to say I'm a
[1:29:52] little God
[1:29:56] but you were made in His image you were
[1:30:00] made to be Gods you were you you're made
[1:30:04] to do this you're made that's why you
[1:30:06] created you amen now we're in battle
[1:30:10] with the perverter
[1:30:11] we're in battle with the liar we're in
[1:30:15] battle with the the one who takes this
[1:30:17] word of God and and uses it as an
[1:30:19] insulator do you know what I mean or or
[1:30:23] a substitute to give you something other
[1:30:26] than the the same exact anointing that
[1:30:30] was in him in you and you to do the
[1:30:33] exact same word and he said if it don't
[1:30:35] line up with that conductor then it's
[1:30:38] the wrong anointed just think
[1:30:41] we've been given the word of God
[1:30:44] we've been given the spirit of God when
[1:30:47] these two when the word and the Spirit
[1:30:48] come together it produces
[1:30:52] eternity
[1:30:53] in each and every one of us okay do you
[1:30:56] realize how much power you're packing
[1:31:02] I mean you look at yourself just the way
[1:31:05] the word looked at you tonight
[1:31:10] what what is a messiah it's one that has
[1:31:13] Dominion yeah
[1:31:15] right power dominion over you see
[1:31:19] something in your family that's not
[1:31:20] right you don't like you've got dominion
[1:31:23] and power over that spirit
[1:31:26] amen you got you've got you've got a
[1:31:29] promise like Abraham Abraham said God
[1:31:32] said so right that was the word that
[1:31:36] word was the conductor that brought the
[1:31:39] anointing to him to believe it and he
[1:31:42] stayed with it and believed it and it
[1:31:44] led him right to the baby
[1:31:47] oh I'd like to just stay on that for
[1:31:49] just an hour right there because that
[1:31:53] word conductor the word is the conductor
[1:31:57] if you believe the word that conductor
[1:32:00] that word that you believe brings that
[1:32:03] anointing on you to bring that word to
[1:32:06] pass it led to the baby
[1:32:10] he believed God he was going around
[1:32:12] testifying he's going to have a baby
[1:32:16] as long as the word was there and the
[1:32:18] conductor was there the anointing was
[1:32:21] there to anoint him to believe every
[1:32:24] promise of God and every son and
[1:32:26] daughter of God is Anointed to believe
[1:32:29] every promise of God you are anointed
[1:32:32] for this message you were anointed to
[1:32:36] believe this message
[1:32:38] you heard that word that word came to
[1:32:40] you you believed it and that conductor
[1:32:43] of the word brought the anointing of
[1:32:46] this message right into your life to do
[1:32:49] the same signs and wonders that you did
[1:32:52] it don't have to be a big show
[1:32:56] but you know you've got Dominion a Son
[1:32:59] of God he said is like a Mystic he walks
[1:33:03] in a world all of his own and he has
[1:33:06] power and dominion over every
[1:33:09] circumstance in every situation
[1:33:12] all right because he's got something
[1:33:15] that's uh you know what a conductor is
[1:33:17] it's like a a wire so it's like having
[1:33:20] electricity everywhere you can have all
[1:33:22] kinds of electricity but it never gets
[1:33:25] to do anything intelligence channels
[1:33:28] write down a conductor and then it
[1:33:31] produces what that electricity was sent
[1:33:34] for to produce
[1:33:36] and you've got that power
[1:33:39] be living right in you the anointed
[1:33:42] Church
[1:33:44] the anointed Messiahs I like that
[1:33:49] I mean it makes me feel good too
[1:33:52] you know I'm not I'm not always just a
[1:33:56] sinner
[1:33:57] just the sinner you're just a sinner yes
[1:34:00] yeah I I I I was just a sinner
[1:34:06] that's exactly what I was
[1:34:09] I was away from God
[1:34:12] I could break glasses
[1:34:15] you know what I mean I could I could
[1:34:18] study and go into all the Realms of of
[1:34:21] the knowledge and everything against
[1:34:23] here but that's not what I was made for
[1:34:28] I was made to have the same anointing he
[1:34:31] had that's why he came and paid the
[1:34:33] price he paid the price of all you can
[1:34:36] put all the stuff all the amorites out
[1:34:39] and everything else you have the title
[1:34:42] deed and you can go back and have what
[1:34:45] you were in the beginning this is where
[1:34:47] we're at church
[1:34:53] they've got the conductor
[1:34:56] you understand until the seals were open
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] man didn't just excuse my crudeness
[1:35:04] right but it's like you have a conductor
[1:35:07] an extension cord you might consider it
[1:35:10] as a conductor
[1:35:12] you know what I mean if it's something
[1:35:13] that the power comes down
[1:35:16] well you've got this extension cord and
[1:35:18] you're trying to plug it into everything
[1:35:20] in the world
[1:35:22] but one day you plug it into the word
[1:35:25] and that that power comes down that
[1:35:28] extension toward the extension cords the
[1:35:30] word so you plug into that word then all
[1:35:33] the power that's in the word of God
[1:35:35] comes into you it is a conductor that
[1:35:39] comes and anoints you the electricity is
[1:35:43] the anointing that comes in you can
[1:35:46] anoint you can now you have it to
[1:35:49] perform that which the word said you
[1:35:52] would do every promise in this book's
[1:35:55] mine every chapter every verse is every
[1:35:58] line
[1:36:00] then you don't have to be afraid Africa
[1:36:03] says go man you'll come to me on my day
[1:36:05] and said look I did this and I did that
[1:36:08] he said I never knew you they never were
[1:36:11] plugged in
[1:36:13] to the word
[1:36:16] you know he talked about tongues okay
[1:36:19] anybody in here have to give the tongues
[1:36:21] well I'll tell you what we're gonna do
[1:36:23] we're gonna start opening our church on
[1:36:25] Saturday morning
[1:36:28] so those of you that have the gift of
[1:36:30] tongues
[1:36:32] and the gift of interpretations in
[1:36:34] tongues
[1:36:35] you've got a hold of the conductor and
[1:36:37] the spirit of God's come in your life
[1:36:40] and you could come together and we'll
[1:36:42] prophesy and we'll speak in tongues
[1:36:45] we'll write the messages down
[1:36:47] and then and then we'll bring it to the
[1:36:50] church and it'll it'll come to pass
[1:36:54] you don't have to be afraid of that
[1:36:58] you know the prophet of God put people
[1:37:00] he said is it okay he said okay he said
[1:37:02] a woman's forbidden to speak in tongues
[1:37:04] in the church because that's what he's
[1:37:06] how many knows he said that
[1:37:08] you know he said it he said that
[1:37:11] he's got a woman's foreign
[1:37:13] what about him he says well that's okay
[1:37:16] but do it in order
[1:37:19] you know I come together
[1:37:21] if you could wait on the Lord the Lord
[1:37:23] gives you a message in tongues or
[1:37:25] interpretation or a prophecy
[1:37:27] you do it there's a time and there's a
[1:37:30] season for everything but let me tell
[1:37:32] you something you are anointed Messiah
[1:37:36] 24 hours a day
[1:37:41] that's what the baptism of the holy
[1:37:43] spirit is it's the anointing of the word
[1:37:45] on you to manifest the word and flesh in
[1:37:49] you is wonderful church it's glorious
[1:37:52] okay there's no fear in the Lord Jesus
[1:37:56] he's with you he'll use you he doesn't
[1:37:59] and we're not going to put a a a
[1:38:02] five-fold Ministry we're not going to
[1:38:04] put a Nickelodeon ISM in it we're not
[1:38:08] going to say these men are anointed to
[1:38:10] do these and the rest of the people
[1:38:11] aren't
[1:38:13] he said every single one of us was
[1:38:16] Messiah
[1:38:19] Lil gods
[1:38:21] book
[1:38:22] for whatever world you're in whatever
[1:38:25] you come against whatever situations you
[1:38:28] rise up for you're not only there for
[1:38:30] your life but you're there for the lives
[1:38:33] of everybody that you come in contact
[1:38:35] with you have that voltage power of the
[1:38:40] word of God in you that you can shock
[1:38:43] somebody
[1:38:45] I like that
[1:38:49] shock them with the blessings of God
[1:38:52] shock them with the power of God look
[1:38:54] you're elected you're chosen for it oh I
[1:38:57] just think it's wonderful
[1:38:59] it just makes me happy okay I know
[1:39:02] you'll probably go back and finish
[1:39:04] listening to the tape it's got some
[1:39:06] wonderful discernment at the end it's
[1:39:09] just a beautiful understanding but I
[1:39:11] just thought there was a lot of little
[1:39:13] wonderful things in there about faith
[1:39:16] and about who we are and and and what
[1:39:19] God's doing with us and I hope that you
[1:39:22] can re rejoice in that then the word
[1:39:25] make you rejoice
[1:39:27] just what he says
[1:39:30] that's the Fountain of Life
[1:39:32] just what he says the word don't need no
[1:39:36] help
[1:39:36] amen but don't you love to worship Him
[1:39:39] the prophet of God said after the word
[1:39:42] comes he says that's the time to worship
[1:39:44] and and so I don't know if you have to
[1:39:47] go but if you don't have to go I'm just
[1:39:49] going to ask brother Billy to come and
[1:39:51] I'll say a prayer and then we can just
[1:39:53] Worship the Lord and and let him move in
[1:39:56] your heart and and let them flow through
[1:39:59] you and if if a well he's flowing
[1:40:02] through if an Amorite shows up throw
[1:40:05] them out if a Philistine shows up throw
[1:40:08] them out you know take possession of
[1:40:11] your Dominion take possession of your
[1:40:13] kingdom you know you know I've had this
