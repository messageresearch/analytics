Description:
Study On The Anointed Ones At The End Time (65-0725M)
Br. David McGeary (Tape - Br. William Branham)
October 19, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Lord if you have your Bibles let's open up to the book of uh mark and read the last chapter of Mark and and we're going to play a little portion of the word of God tonight and and talk about some of the things in the word of God you know the word of God's our fountain it's everything you know the the greatest stimulation and even in the scriptures when it talks about the wine and the oil it says hurt not the wine and the oil he said that that was the stimulation of Revelation and I hope tonight that Revelation stimulates you because that that's what stimulates you the world is stimulated by a guitar riff and a beating of a drum or or some uh Sports Action but the bride is stimulated by the word of God that's what that's what stimulates the bride amen so let's just read this tonight it says and after he appeared 14th verse of the uh 16th chapter of The Book of Mark Mark 16 14. and after he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere though the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated those are uh such wonderful words of promise but yet those very words are promised have caused me in lots of trouble because they they try to produce it they try to manufacture it but the source of it is the spirit of God Life in The Believer and we want to talk a little bit about that life because as you notice we've been playing different messages and and bringing up different uh things that the prophet of God brought to us showing us that we're at the end time remember here just a few weeks ago oncoming storm how the prophet mentioned when you see the lawlessness and you see this taking place and that's a sign of the end and and so we have different things around us that show us that we're we're closing in on the end time and along with the end time there's great things for the church and uh there's great things for uh uh the bride and yet there's terrible things for the world I heard a man talking about the City Philadelphia and I and he said man he says this is some of the best times ever in Philadelphia he said we have a baseball of undefeated football team and we have a baseball team in the series boy this is great and the other man said yeah he says been you got the worst crime in the in the country too so he says well it's the best of times and the worst of times well I'm not too worried about the worst at times I want the best at times what God's got for me and he's got something for us and I I think if our hearts could get hungry and we could understand where it's at and we could get anchored down on the right things and and you know and not chase the glitter not chase the shine but know where it's just anchored right in God's word you know and uh uh you know I'm not as young as I used to be I can't preach with the emotion that I used to preach with or with the excitement and energy that I used to preach with but I can tell you one thing I've learned a lot down the road I can tell movements and I can tell things it's saying and and I know when I'm on the spot and I know when people are pointing their finger at me and I know but you know what I've carried that cross a long time I the some of the a lot of the preachers even around this country today told me I was Antichrist when I said the mighty Angel setting his foot on the land and sea was in brother branham's Ministry and the son of man was the Fulfillment of the promises of the second coming of the Lord as the devil so I know what it's like to go through the pressure of not being and being misunderstood you know and and like they say you know that I'm against worship and I'm against that I've danced in the spirit more than you all I'll guarantee it I've been dancing in the spirit for over 50 years I've shouted more than you all I put on a tape I just shout down the road me and Ron Peterson one day were going on down the road listening to the message we got so excited we parked the car and got out and started running into counting circles just a praising God I still like to praise God hallelujah you're free to praise God if you ain't praising God it's because you got a problem there's no oppression here keeping you from praising God shout hallelujah hallelujah praise God anybody feel like speaking in tongues speak in tongues I'm sure that if you speak in tongues it's the spirit of God and there'll be a prophecy right behind it you know okay that's wonderful wonderful if I'm sorry we can't run around here because we're too crowded but in the canoe Church we're going to have 20 foot between the platform and the first row so you can run around and praise him and Shout God okay and and but I'm going to share a little something with you tonight okay and it's out of anointed ones at the end time we're gonna listen to 25 minutes of anointed ones at the end time now there's a lot of difference between me possibly and a lot of other people is that if you're going to hear it from me you're going to hear it from the prophet what separates conjunct my a lot of good friends in UPC Church tonight they're there speaking in tongues they're prophesying they're dancing and they're running around the spirit but what's the one thing missing the word so I'm going to read a couple statements play this tape and show you something that the prophet of God taught it's not to make you afraid it's to make you sure okay because what did we preach last uh I think it was uh Sunday I I think I I I called it uh the acceptance of your election the acceptance of your election that you've been elected for something different than what's going on the acceptance of your election and so I'd like to read a few statements to you before we go at uh further and uh and just so that uh it it would be a kind of a blessing uh to you to uh to uh my Pages stuck together here but uh okay this now we know without faith it's impossible to please God right so the greatest weapon that the bride has is what faith faith is connected with love doubt is connected with fear so pure love of God's word will produce pure faith this is what our prophet of God said he said blessed art thou Simon of Jonah Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this to you my father which in heaven has revealed it and Upon This Rock I'll build my church the true revelation of the word there is the true vine again Abel by faith Abel by faith offered a what a more excellent sacrifice that's what we want to do we want to offer a more excellent worship we want to offer a more excellent move of God we want to offer a more excellent and we can only do that by what by faith by the word okay he said you say it it it wasn't a revelation what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God fake is the revelation of the will of God now if I want to shout I want to shout because God has revealed to me what his will is now that's we're shouting about I know the will of God it's been revealed to me we already preached and listened to the prophet of God to explain about a manufactured Revival and which we talked that as sheep he doesn't have to produce wool he Bears wool so we we know what faith is Faith is a revelation of the will of God by Revelation because the will of God has been made known to you now there's the Holy Ghost that's the Holy Spirit now the question is what's what's this other it's going to be good I love it he said so faith is a revelation then I'd like to say this he he says this he says he and he says where whether we're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostal what more we're all the same we are not the same he says ye are a separate people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise of this day and you're not of them I know that's awful strong but that's the truth just the same dedicated to a service in this last day come out from amongst debt wow that's a pretty strong statement he said this he says and then over here he makes this statement every sign every Wonder anointed men prophesied all kinds of things going forth all kinds of sign all kinds of Wonders how you going to tell the difference watch the word for this hour that's how all right so every time something Rises up and the question Rises up the answer to the question is the word who has the word for this hour the messenger for the age has the word for the hour so I could sit here and explain things to you but how much better would it be to have the messenger explain so what we're going to do we're going to listen to 25 minutes point out a few things and understand we're not against anything we're only for the truth we're only for what's pure what's right and what's undefiled that's all that we want we want it to be God and Only God hate men and no restrictions you know feel free to come out and spy out our liberties uh in the Lord I hope that I've lived a real transparent life in front of you you're all oh you know what I drive you're welcome to come over to my house you know come in I've got nothing to hide I've got nothing to preach you know I'm we're all in the same boat we're following the message of the hour so if we could all just anchor into it and and listen and you know like and be be a participant in the ministry can you know if if you're gonna come Fellowship here listen to the tapes we play listen to what's trying to be said uh dig into it get involved in it okay let it just don't go in through a service go study it out because there there we're we're right down a Razor's Edge just like the deity you know brother Branham wasn't God but yet there was God right there very hard to tell it apart sometimes it was God and sometimes it was just the prophet but he lived such a close life to God that even his natural life was such a reflection of God it isn't that what we're promised to be little Messiah amen but we want our power to be what from the life that's in US so let's just listen this 25 minutes and and it's it's astounding what he's going to say and then we'll go study it maybe we'll study this message out a little bit but this is one of the masterpieces that the prophet of God preached the token was a masterpiece and this is a masterpiece so 25 minutes you're all capable of listening to this and and just stay with it he reads scripture she's laying down the foundation to what that he's saying and bringing it down to how do you tell the difference okay you can't tell the difference from the outside there's got to be something deeper than that so okay Brothers if you pick up brother Mike right there and if you have your phones and and you would like to um uh turn to it it's anointed ones at the end time uh just put it so you can't have no other things coming in at paragraph 15 and we're going to go to 15 tips uh 15 to 21. he's going to talk about a lot of things he's going to talk about anointing you know what I mean anointing is a big word that's used now right but anybody can be anointed Joyce Meyers my favorite preacher they say she's annoying it you know what I mean and I can't deny it so there's got to be something deeper and richer and your chosen and elected for the deeper and richer things of God God bless you if you if you have your tablet your phone uh I guess nowadays you can look at it if you don't want to look at it there but God richly bless you just listen to this astounding first minutes of this message God bless you in the book of Saint Matthew pardon me 24th verse the 24th chapter or other beginning with the 15th verse I wish to read a potion of his word and when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing in the Holy place who shall readeth let him understand then let them which are in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the Housetop a housetop not come down to take anything out of his house you need to let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and hold on to them that are with child and to them to give stuck in those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there be no flesh saved but for the elect sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ are there believe it not far there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elected behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth the holy is in the secret chamber believe it not or as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even into the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be far worse forever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered how far a subject I would like to take the 24th verse to emphasize on this verse for our Sunday school lesson this morning and listen close while I re-read this again for there shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elected now our subject this morning or a text rather I want to take the anointed ones at the end time that's the subject that I wish to speak on or the text the anointed ones at the end time I believe that we are living in the end time I think most anyone that the scripture reader or even a believer knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world amen there will be no use of brightness because there won't be anybody to read it it's at the end of the time just when I do not know just how long it will be not even the angels of Heaven Nor is that mineral hour but we've been told by the Lord Jesus that when these things that we see now begin to come to pass than to lift up our heads for our Redemption is drawing now now what drawing thy means I do not know May mean as the scientist said the other day on the television speaking of the Great thousands of miles breaking the Earth is going to sink he was asked the question it could sink there that's Los Angeles the west coast and many of you seen how they followed it with radar went up juice broken below San Jose on across over into Alaska out through the eluthian islands about 200 miles out into the sea and come back down into San Diego went around it behind Los Angeles and come up there a great pocket and all these earthquakes within Heaven is the volcanic hitting this great a holla Dipper like in their uh I can't call the name that they they called it however when that shakes that use these earthquakes we've been having for years on the west coast now it's cracked all the way around and the scientists said one the man said to the other That Could Fall In he said not good but it will said but not in our generation perhaps that in the next five minutes of the next five years we don't know just when this week was sent me a headlines in the paper a big hundred thousand dollar homes cricking and cracking the people moving away and they don't know how to stop it there's no way to stop it see God can do whatever he wants to and there's nobody can tell him how to do it you build homes you can make scientific things and God is a creator of science how are you going to stop him he can destroy the Earth this morning by fleas if he wants to you realize he can speak please into existence and to be 40 miles deep in a half hour's time see you know to eat people right off the ground he's God he just does as he will he's Sovereign in himself now seeing all this accumulation of evidence that the hour that we now live in I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and to draw them out since the seals has been opened and find out the truth of these things as God has been so loyal to us with his grace to show us these things I want you to notice here in Matthew 24 Jesus use the term of Christ the c-h-r-i-f-t-s Christ not Christ but Christ plural not singular Christ therefore the word Christ means the anointed one and then if it's anointed there will be not only one but many anointed the anointed one see and otherwise if he wanted to break it down so we would more or less understand it better you say in the last days there shall rise false anointed ones now that seems almost impossible see the terms of anointed but notice the very next words and false prophets p-r-o-p-h-e-p-s plural now anointed one is one with a message and the only way the mystics can be brought out is by one that's anointed and that would be a prophet anointed there shall rise false anointed teachers a prophet teaches what his message is anointed teachers but of anointed people with false teaching anointed ones Christ plural prophets plural and there is such a thing as up a Christ singular then these would have to be anointed ones that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because there are anointed ones 90 now it's a Sunday school lesson we want to to try to bring this to a real Showdown by the scriptures not for what someone else has said about but just reading the scriptures you may say how can this be would the uh anointed once what were the Christ c-h-r-i-s-t-s anointed Christ and false prophets anointed ones but false prophets Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust as someone might say to me uh do you believe it that anointing on those people means that it's anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine holy spirit of God upon a person and yet they are false now listen close and see what he said they shall show signs and wonders in so much that we deceived a very elected if it were possible and they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit I know this sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and explain it by the word that's absolutely thus saith the Lord the truth now let's turn in our Bibles just a minute to Matthew the fifth chapter and begin with the uh the 45th verse and see now as we read for a few moments on these scriptures and then if we get to hear what we'll give you so you if we fail to read all of them then you get your Bible and and also you can read them as we leave here and you go home and and you read what the Bible says about it now to take our time to get a a basic fact because I'm making a statement here that's astounding how can the Holy Spirit anoint a false teacher but that's what Jesus said but happened now Matthew the fifth chapter the 40 uh fifth verse let's read now let's get begin a little behind it the 44th but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them and hate you pray for them to despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven bar he maketh his son to rise on the evil and the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust the rain comes upon the evil as same as the good now to follow this up to another prophecy pertaining to this may we turn out to Hebrews the sixth chapter for the next follow-up first on this word Paul bringing back to mind the same thing that Jesus said Paul speaking now while you're hunting it and you out in the broadcast get your Bibles near you in a piece of paper and look up this now Hebrews the sixth chapter Paul writing to the Hebrews showing them the shadows and the tights bring them from under Judaism into Christianity showing them how all the old things just foreshadowed the things that was to come I was speaking now Hebrews 6. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ the h-r-i-f-t sangler let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance it works and of Faith towards God of Doctrine of baptism and of laying on of hands on the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permits far it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted other Heavenly gift and were made for takers of the Holy Spirit I want to call your attention just a minute you notice that gift and not gifts for takers are not the Heavenly gifts but the Heavenly gift singer Christ singer gift Angler Heavenly gift and made were takers of the Holy Spirit and have tasted all the word of God tasted of what the word of God and the power of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew themselves again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame for listen the Earth drinketh in the rain that cometh off upon it to bring forth herbs me for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessings from God but that which beareth Thor's rowers is rejected and is nine to cursing whose end is to be burned I'll compare that with Matthew 5 24 again notice Jesus said the rain and the Sun comes upon the Earth that God sends it to prepare the food and the things for the peoples of the earth and the rain is sent for the food the herbs but the Terriers weeds being in the field receive the same thing the same rain that makes the wheat grow is the same rain that makes the weeds grow how I had such a lesson on that one time when I first met the Pentecostal people and it was a great lesson to me I seen two men one never heard speaking in tongues before one spoken tongue other interpreted Vice Versi and would tell the truth say that there's many in here should repent tonight there's women and men both and people are raised up go to the altar I thought how glorious and then with the little gift of the Holy Spirit I talked to those man just you know how and the German just a little way to find out and one of them was a genuine Christian and he was a real determinant of Christ and the other one was a hypocrite and one of them the one that was a hypocrite was living with a black-headed woman running around with a blonde and had children by her was right there in a vision couldn't be denied and I spoke to him about it he looked at me and walked around the building now I was confused sure enough I thought of coming to Angels then I wonder if it was among devils how could this be I could not understand it and for years I kept my hands off of it in one day where George Smith the boy goes with my daughter we went yesterday up to the Old Mill place where I go to pray nature being in there a couple days the Holy Spirit brought this scripture back to me for the rain cometh off upon the Earth to dress it with herbs the thighs and thistles lived on that same rain and whose end is to be burned living by the same life-giving resource of God that are understood that by Jesus said by their fruits they are known now therefore the rain dropping down upon the natural uh vegetation of the Earth is a type of the spiritual rain which gives eternal life dropping down upon the church for we call it the formerine and the latter rain and it's a rain pouring out of God's spirit upon his church notice it's a very strange thing here see when them seed went in the ground however they got there they were Thorns to begin with but there are the wheat that went in the ground and the herbs were herbs to begin with and each herb producing itself over again shown that it was in the original beginning and they will deceive the elected if it were possible those are getting the same rain same blessing showing the same signs same wonders see they will deceive or shall deceive the elected if it were possible now Thorn cannot help being a thorn and neither can we help being a wheat it's what the creator of each one determined at the beginning that's the elective the same rain sun rises of a morning it spreads across the Earth as it had this early day that we lived and the sun same Sun it rises in the east as the same Sun it sets in the West and that sun is sent to ripen the green upon the Earth which our bodies are made from we are living by dead substance that's the only way you can live if something has to die every day so you live natural then isn't it true that if you're your body has to live by dead substance for Natural Life then you've got to have something die spiritually to save your spiritual life and God became material flesh and died that we might live there's no church no other thing in the world could save you but God that's the only thing that they live by now run the scriptures Jesus is the word in the beginning what's the word in the word is made flesh and dwelt Among Us in beginning what's the word and the words with God and the Word was made flesh and we'll dwelled Among Us and man shall not live by bread alone for the physical but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouths of God and you see we live by the word and that is God now the Sun comes across and brightens the grain I cannot write the all at once as it goes on maturing it constantly ripens until it comes to a full ear so is it today but the church it started in its infancy back in the Dark Age where he's under the ground it's grown now into maturity and we can see it perfectly how that God choose nature always you cannot disturb nature that's what's the matter today we're flying bombs and out there in that ocean breaking it and busting around with atomic bomb you're just breaking more of that dirt off all the time dropping into it you cut down the trees Farms will take you damn up the river it'll overflow you've got to find God's way of doing things and stay in it we've denominated people in the churches and organizations look what we got then God's provided way of it but you see he stands the rain not your subject on the just and the unjust Jesus tells you you're not in Matthew 24 it would be a sign at the end time now if this sign is only to be known at the end time there will have to be after the opening of those seals it's a sign of the end that would be when these things happens it'll be at the end time it'll be a sign now so the elected will not be confused and these things you see it that has got to be revealed exposed notice both the wheat and the weeds live by the same anointing from heaven both of them Rejoice over I remember this referring back to this instance up there that day at The Greens Mill I I've seen that Vision come up and there was a great Earth and it had been all disc it up then I want to soar forth first I want to keep that before you what What Goes Forth first then what follows it and is this man with white on came forth around the earth sowing seed then behind him come a man guard close on look very sneaking slipping along behind him storing weeds and as this taken place then I seen both crops come up and as they come up one was wheat and the other was weed and there come a drought that one looked like both of them had their heads down just crying for rain then there come a great Cloud over the Earth and it rained and the wheat raised up and said praise the Lord praise the Lord and the weeds raise up in our praise the Lord praise the Lord same results although I'm perishing both of them going away and then the wheat comes up and gets thirsty and because it was in the same field the same Garden the same place under the same spout dare come up wheat and they'll come up Terriers by the very same thing notice the same anointing water brings forth the wheat brings forth the weed the same Holy Spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save Souls that gives them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the justice the very same spirit now you can't make it out of the way and understand Matthew 24 24. he said there shall rise false Christ false anointed ones Anointed with the genuine thing but be false prophets of it false teachers of it what would make a man want to be a false teacher something is true now we get down to the mark of the beast in a few minutes you'll see it's the nomination all teachers a false anointed anointed Christ but false teachers don't know where you can sit just like here some time ago I've quoted this I might quoted the calls were hooked up Across the Nation one day I was talking to a friend of mine where this is coming in this morning in Arizona and he had a citrus farm and he had a tree there which was an orange tree that was bearing grapefruits and lemons tangerine tangelo's I forget how many different fruits there was on that one tree and I said to the the man I said how is it what kind of tree is that he said the tree itself is an orange tree I said what as he got grapefruits on him why has he got lemons on it he said they're grafted into it I said I see well now I said now next year when that tree comes forth with another crop of fruit which the all right about the same time I said then it will bring forth all together oranges if it's a navel orange tree it'll bring forth The navelenges Wanted sir he said no sir ever grafted Branch will bring forth of this kind I said you mean that lemon Vine will bring forth the lemon out of that orange tree he said yes sir will the grapefruit bring forth a grapefruit out of that orange tree said yes sir that's the nature of the branches grafted into it I said praise be to God he said what do you mean I said one more question now will that orange tree ever bring forth oranges again he said when he puts forth another branch when it puts forth another branch not when one's grafted into it but they're all citrus fruit and they live off of the Citrus life that's in the citrus tree I said there you are the methodists will bring forth methodists every time the baptism reinforce Baptists every time the Catholic of rainforest Catholic every time but the Church of the Living God will produce Christ from The Roots the word every time if it ever puts forth another divine of its own now you can graft it in there you see every grapefruit lemon Angelo Tangerine whatever the citrus fruits they are every one of them can live in that tree but bearing thoughts witness of the tree living by the three it's it they are living and thriving on the genuine life that's in that tree now there's Matthew 24. 24. living by the same life but they wasn't right at the beginning they're bearing false witness of that tree it's a fine Street yet it's a citrus tree and they say this church this denomination is bearing record of Christ it's not a false baptism false witness of the word trying to say that the power of God was only for the disciples Jesus himself said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel that every prince of every tree you've ever bring forth every breaks that'll be in the tree and these signs shall follow the genuine branches where as long as it's a tree as long as it's putting forth branches to the end of the world in mundane they shall cast out devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink daily things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see the hour We're living do you want Jesus said remember this is at the end time not back under Wesley's back there now at the end time this is to take place and watch the scriptures let them testify Jesus said search the scriptures or in them you think or believe that you have eternal life and they are the ones that testify of me in other words if this tree ever brings forth a branch I am divine the tree we are the branches he that believeth the need the works that I do shall he do also thank John 14 12. now he that abideth in me he that him that was in my root at the beginning that's the reason Jesus was both the root and offspring of David he was before David in David and after David both root and offspring of David the Morning Star the rose of chandelier in the valley Alpha and Omega Father Son and Holy Ghost In the End dwells of fullness of the godhead bodily both root and offspring of David ye that is the elected life the predestinated life that's in me and that he is the word from the beginning when he comes forth he'll bear my fruits Saint John 14 12. but others will live by the same thing call themselves Christians and believers not all that says lord lord well there is now this is to take place in being manifested in the last days when the mysteries of God should be finished as we'll get to a little later these trees the true vibe you like that Pearl uh a good Shake right so there's there's there's there's got to be there's got to be something so you've got remember what he said we read it earlier he says same sign Sam's wondered how do you tell the difference by the word so there's God you've got to judge it past uh what would appear to be the anointing you can't judge it by the anointing because the anointing's right remember Mary had the life but she wasn't matured now here's where the real thing that struck me he said this doesn't manifest itself till after the opening of the seals so it shows us that the life that they're grafting into is the word life or the message life that's it so a lot of things had grafted itself into the message and they're getting their life from the message they're getting their sermons they're getting their everything from it they're getting it from the message they got everything they're drawing their life from the message but now remember what he said he said if it's what they were in the beginning even though they grafted to it and they're drawing their life from it if they're if they're a legalist they're going to put forth legalism of the same life the same anointing everything's the same if they're Pentecostal and they're grafted in Pentecostal what's going to come out Pentecostal that's their fruit and then if if they're you know if they're real uh Grace Grace liberal and everything and that's what they Graft in that the Earth's gonna come out but the beautiful promise is if that tree ever puts forth another limbia it'll be Christ Hallelujah okay and so here we are part we're part of the same tree they're grafted in all around us and they're starting to put forth their fruit but what's the last one that puts forth his fruit is when it puts forth its branch and what's that Branch going to be it's going to be word so if we sit back and it looks like it's putting forth fruit if it's putting forth fruit and it's putting forth fruit and it's the same life in the same life but how do you know you can't go by the anointing you've got to go by the word so ask yourself which one has the word which one's playing the word which one has the prophet's voice which one has the quotes which one has the books oh Thorne can't help being a thorn but can't help what they are but you can't judge it by the anointing you say is that the life yes it's the same life it gets the life but but and and I'm I'm happy they're fruitful in fact I'm happy they're drafted in that's what a Christian wants he wants all the life to go everywhere go into all the world and preach the gospel but remember this life is going to be Christ now just just listen to this real close again I'd like to just bring this up for my just for the God's word here what he says he says he says and then he brings up he says so when when these things are grafted in what did he say they're doing they're they're bearing false witness their their part of the message but they're bearing false witness to the message so in other words the lemon that comes out the fruit of the lemon is saying this tree is lemons this is what the tree but it's very false witness and then the other one comes up and it's producing grapefruit and therefore you go up to it you say this P the grapefruit he said this grapefruit is the fruit of the tree all grafted into the same thing all getting the same life The Same Spirit so you've got to so we got to come to that conclusion it's the same life but one has a different maturity it's called for a different election it called for a different purpose and and listen he says and Jesus said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every branch in every tree that'll bring forth fruit every branch that that'll be in the tree and these signs shall follow the genuine branch where as long as it's a tree as long as it's putting forth branches to the end of the world in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see the hour that we're living in that word understands on the do you notice that for laying on of his the laying on of hands the preaching of the Gospel the casting out of devils every single one of those has to do with works and not worship very very plain because we don't want he said the reason that this is preached to end the confusion do you understand so so with that when we start going we don't look for something that's generated by worship we look for something that's generated by the word and there's my excitement is caused by the word of God I I'm gonna I don't Witness when I'm uh I don't come into you and witness Christ to you brother I want to introduce the prophet to you I don't I don't need to introduce the prophet to you I don't need to introduce the baptism of the Holy Ghost to you where do you do that where he told you to do it go into all the world and preach the gospel that's where these signs shall follow but if the branch that's grafted in is taking the life in that life's a Pentecostal life or a Catholic life or a Baptist life or a Methodist life then that's the natural fruits they're going to produce but this message is producing little Messiahs people that can take the resurrected power and meet the devil and cast them out can meet The Sinner and introduce him to Christ the rain falls under just in the unjust so to end up the bottom finest you'll go through this later as we go through it later you'll find out the only thing that separates them one has elected seed word only the elected of Abraham can go can you criticize it no because if you criticize it you're criticizing the life it's the same life it's the same anointing but the believer runs after the word word first then signs follow the word first and it it it's it's a a strong subject and he he brought it in many ways I think we touched on it and see does not air with the shock it was hard for that for that shock to give birth to the seed because it was the same life it's the same life it's the same spirit it's the same baptism under the same anointing praise God if don't be afraid of the anointing it's the same anointing the same anointing that night lemon was the same anointing that anointed the grapefruit the grapefruit rejoices and draws life Hallelujah produces grapefruit the lemon rejoices and Praises God and draws lemon don't be afraid to draw life but if you're from the root right you're from the beginning they're in the seed and you were ordained and elected for this day to come forth up through that everybody being crafted in and fellowshipping and coming to life but your calling and your election is to put forth another Christ little Messiahs with the power of the Resurrection word by revelation stimulation by revelation I don't particularly like lemons unless you put two pounds of sugar with it then it's pretty good I like grapefruit again but you have to add a lot of sugar other ones I just eat off the vine we can eat it all but what God's putting forth you understand it it is not what was grafted in before that's why he said you are different you are the elected life and I close with this statement because he says he he that is the elected life the predestinated life that's in me you are the elected life the predestinated life he said that's in me the life that's in him if the Same Spirit that dwelt in him dwelleth in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body this is about rapture this is about this age after the seals the resurrected life not the anointing not the rain we we rejoice in the rain hallelujah praise God for the rain when the rain comes bless God when Revelation comes raise your hand shout there's nothing restricting you and limiting you from shouting in the name of the Lord who's talking about money that means we can speak in tongues we can prophesy it don't do you no good let's lay hands on the sick also let's cast out Devils Also let's take up deadly things false doctrines false teachings false attitudes false spirits and not let him harm us but let's go to what our life source is Our Life Source isn't the rain Our Life Source the sun because we've come into that maturity so don't be shaken When You See It grafted in fruits foreign and you say well we don't have that fruit but we've got the life what am I I'm predestinated produce the life that was in the root so don't be confused that's why he said if I got to preach this he said so there won't be a confusion he says because this was going to happen at the end time after the seals there would rise in a group that was anointed living off the same life it's a sign that were at the end or it's a sign because remember they both ripen about the same time so whatever they are they're putting the first how many notice that they weren't of this message to begin with right Todd pruned them off there will be a lot of things that's been crafted in but you don't have to worry about that if you're part of the root and then you were before Geary and after and you will be part of the Resurrection don't shake don't bring those criticisms you know I'm a hundred percent okay you want gifts go read exactly how the prophet of God said that gift should work when's worship to come worship comes after the word you get in the spirit the piano don't get in the spirit the organ don't get in the spirit the music don't bring the spirit you know what really brings the spirit to a real genuine son and daughter of God it's the revelation of Jesus Christ making something known to him that's what will thrill you that's why I could sit down and listen to any man that preaches this message and read these quotes and if the word is what excites me okay if music excites you praise God Shout Hallelujah don't don't look at me if you can't raise your hands and worship and dance if you've got something going on between you and God but I'm telling you I am not holding you down but if it's the word is present because then it's got to be genuine it can't be grafted in I don't want something that's grafted do you want to be grafted in or do you want to be genuine I don't think I'm grafted I mean I just raised the rank singers sinner a really ranked singer too but I I just want the life of what this voice is trying to create and he's trying to create people that aren't relying on any feelings any emotions or any rain because they're the fruit themselves and in them they have every single predestinated power was in them in the beginning and the Son and the word has brought that forth forth and now it's a manifestation as we read last week he said this is the maturity the manifestation of the full word of God in the beginning the word was made flesh and now flesh is being made being made word but stay in the word and ripen just because grafted in branches are coming to maturity don't let that question Where You Are we love them all I love any Christian brother I love them all I love the spirit move wherever it moves but my lot is to be the genuine branch that comes off the original word seed so feel free in the spirit but let the word be what matures you and makes you and mold you and stay where the word is and as he'll go through here if you want to jump ahead in this book you'll see how he continually talks about the word how he continually talks about the son of man how he continually talks about what was to come in this day to cause this tree to put forth a new branch so don't be critical of anybody we don't compare ourselves with nobody we're not trying to act be like anybody compare ourselves there's only one thing that we know is we have a voice a message a word as brother Billy bought so beautiful today's his birthday I didn't know if he made it tonight or not but uh brother Billy's birthday so everybody texted him and wish him happy birthday and call him and uh and we got him a present from the church to him and uh but don't you you just don't have to be in conflict with anything you can be at peace and his brother Billy said I thought it was so beautiful he said when the word comes it has a faith and an anointing with it to bring it to pass I thought that was so beautiful so beautiful where we've even heard where is the anointing we know it's the anointed word we know where where the gospel is the anointing is and so we can get the same anointing from the word because that's what's in your heart and I I honestly believe if we could have confidence in our election and accept our election and accept what our calling is even though the fruit looks good even though it's got the same life we wait until he puts forth that branch and that's the branch that we want we want to put forth the fruits that are identical to his fruits where it's our it's not measured by worship and the prophet of God said the time will come where the church is measured by their worship but we want to be measured by our work show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my words I want to go to that next level where everyone in here sisters brother when you see your loved ones and they're ill you can go up to them and lay hands on them you say can a sister lay hands on a sister and pray for him certainly that when you know someone's got a demon you can sit down to him I talk to him about the love of Christ the power of the resurrection and pray them through go into all the world it isn't assemble yourselves it's going to all the world and preach the gospel and you'll find out you're anointed for it you're called for it you're chosen for it you're elected you are the last branch that the tree puts out and it'll have the true fruits of the Gospel amen Lord bless you let's Stand Together let the word stimulate you let the word stimulate you amen let's sing a song I'll wait for my Oregon player now Joy that's not a violin is it now what is it called a viola we have a viola player say if that don't make us top class okay I I I I I don't know what does do you uh-huh and we have John on guitar there and Joseph on the base and Michael on percussions all we need is a song leader in that right but other than that anyway let's say I am thinking of a rapture amen is anybody else thinking about a rapture amen I've changed that thrilled my heart he says when you see this grafting in when you see the church living by the same life when you see him manifesting Christ under the same anointing he said praise God it can only happen at the end time it's a sign that we're at the end it's a sign that the church is coming into maturity it's a sign oh praise God that we're fixing to go amen oh I am thinking of the Rapture in that blessed are gathering in how we'll
