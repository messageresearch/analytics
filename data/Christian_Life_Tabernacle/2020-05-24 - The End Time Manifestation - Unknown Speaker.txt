are so thankful this morning to be here to be in your presence Lord to be called by your name what a privilege that is Lord we're humbled at the very thought that you'd reach down to fallen man and by your wonderful glorious will speak to each of our hearts and draw us unto you so Lord we stand here this morning we want to glorify you and honor you and praise you and thank you Lord find every thought every spirit that would take our minds and our hearts to someplace else or to help us to draw closer to you this morning that our faith would be strengthened the Lord we'd be emboldened soldiers for the cross or we place this hour in your hands as time together Lord may we go out different than we came in for the honor and glory of Jesus Christ we pray well we're glad to have each one here this morning turn around and salute somebody tell me you're looking good in spite of it all god bless you each we're certainly glad to be here and towards giving us a beautiful somewhat muggy day we were talking about work this week others were talking I was on on the edge listening about the whole idea of conspiracy theories because they're everywhere people were talking about they saw this on Facebook and they heard this on the news or this on talk radio and my goodness there's evil on every hand which is no surprise to us but to the world kind of unsettling governments are suspicious medicine is suspicious who knows who's everybody's suspicious and and it was kind of an intriguing thought and discussion as you know some people were blowing it off and others were kind of committed to this all idea that it's one big conspiracy the truth is it is one big conspiracy it started in heaven long time ago when Satan said I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will mount upon the Mount of the congregation's and the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High and everything that's ever happened since that time has been part of that great conspiracy you look down through history you're a history buff Rome was nothing but one conspiracy after another you study the royalty of England it was always a conspiracy something was afoot every culture every society all down through scripture all down through history everywhere you look there was conspiracy Wars politics our own history in ancient Israel the stories are full of history of conspiracies Saul was obsessed with the idea that David was conspiring against him Absalom conspired against his father King David after King Solomon came there were many conspiracies in the books of Samuel and kings and chronicles some chapters have they mentioned three different conspiracies in one chapter and it's just an ongoing manifestation of that one big conspiracy but what we know is that despite all of the efforts of humankind Satan working through our history to achieve his I will he isn't able to overcome the great I am and that's the that's the blessing to us you know that's that's not a conspiracy theory that's a biblical truth that's a fact and and so yes there is a conspiracy but yes we know the outcome of it we know who the victor is and you know it's kind of this is this is not old news Martin Luther wrote about this 500 years ago when he wrote and though this world with Devils filled should threaten to undo us we will not fear for God hath willed his truth to triumph through us the Prince of Darkness grim we tremble not for him his rage we can endure for lo his doom is sure one little word shall fell him and we have the word that we know will fell that enemy and you know if you're in a physical emergency we're told you dial nine-one-one every kid learns that at a very early age you're in a spiritual emergency it's been suggested you dial 33 three that would be Jeremiah 33:3 which says call unto me and I will answer thee and show thee great and hidden things that you have not known he goes on to say because on to say behold I will bring it health and cure I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honor before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that I do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it so I guess if we feel all worked up about some conspiracy or so torment The Devil's bringing upon us we could just dial 33:3 call upon the name of the Lord because the great I am has overcome that I will and Isaiah 26 says that I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee let's turn to Psalms 97 this morning as we read it together at home and here the Lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of Isles be glad there of clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitations of his throne a fire going before him and burn ahthe up his enemies round about his lightnings and lightness the world the earth saw and trembled the hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of idols worship Him all ye gods Zion heard and was glad and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments O Lord for thou Lord aren't high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods he that loved the Lord paid evil he preserveth the souls of his Saints he delivered them out of the hand of the wicked light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart rejoice in the Lord do you righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his

[Music] [Music] this is racist by the creatively father your subject to have come this morning to worship You Lord to lift up your name Oh God they just come into the realization we are people created by you Lord to worship You Lord to give you all the honor and everything Lord will cast our crowns down and and fell at your feet this morning and and say that worthy is the lamb by the way I reminded when the book was taken when you stood up and you went in and he says John says that he began to cry because he knew that that book was so important that somebody had to take it and and Oh God that how he looked and he looked they look under the sea and a young earth and in heaven and they couldn't find no one worthy but all there was a lamb that was slain and the scripture says that he came out of the throne and he began to walk towards the book and and as you walk towards the book and he took it and says that the whole heaven just started shouting nobody they began to worship You Lord and for the lab he who died is worthy Lord father this morning we can certainly worship you this morning you deserves worship why because you were worried Lord and you are worthy this morning we were bound in sins and darkness and places and came from all over the places and all kinds of sins and all kinds of stuff Lord but the word lamb that was what he came by our way and He gave His life so that we may live and we could certainly say like Paul this morning that my life that we have this morning is not our own but is yours be lifting up Oh God and forgive our shortcomings and our sins Oh God and that's so often beset us Lord and we want us to be such in the clear clarity of mind and spirit and and in such a freedom that when we stand before you Lord and we know that you hear our prayers and we know that you are there answering to our needs Lord that needs that we lift it up this morning we commit it to you Lord and pray that even as the word goes forth Lord that our faith may rise to the level where we can receive what we have need of this morning why because the lamb is worthy we thank you for everything Lord we ask that you bless the people remember our pastor this morning Lord and continue to touch him and heal important we ask that you speak to us Lord give us the alertness of mind and just the words to speak that we may worship you this morning we love you and ask those things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen are you happy to be in the house of God and then so glad to see many out in the house of God amen amen let's just open our Bibles some few scripture readings the first lists open in Isaiah chapter 55 we're gonna read a couple of scriptures in there I believe that price to use the scripture not long ago we just want to peek up and then just continue on that same thought line I say we're gonna start from verse 3 chapter and 55 in verse 3 it says incline your ear and come unto me says here your soul it says here and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the short mercies of David behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people behold thou shalt call - shall call a nation that knoweth not that knoweth not in the nation that knoweth that knoweth North d shall run unto thee because because of the LORD thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for he had glorified II so basically he's gonna give you what's yours that what you know and what you don't know all of that will be added unto you it says Sikhi seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will give mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways saith the LORD for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down to snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watered the earth and maketh it to bring forth and bud they may be they may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it will accomplish that which I have I please and I and I sent it for ye he says for ye shall go out in joy with joy and be led from hence with feast and the mountains and the hill shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall cast a toccata hence instead of the throne come up with the fierce tree instead of the Brier shall come up with merrill tree and it shall be to the Lord for the they shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign shall not be cut off so what what a mercy to the what an invitation did those that would comment and I will do those things you may be seated keep your Bibles open we're going to read a couple of more scriptures let's also turn in a very familiar scripture reading Luke 17 we're going to read from verse 28 28 to 30 the scripture says likewise also it shall come it shall it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planet they builded it says but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the days when the Son of Man is revealed it's also turned to John chapter 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and life was the light of men I want you to see the progression in him was life and the life was the light of men says and the light shine ahthe and darkness and darkness comprehended not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but he was sent to bear witness of the light that was he says that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh unto the world he was in the world and the world was was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sons to become two sons of God even them that have believed on his name Amen so this morning just for a few moments we're gonna try to not be too long I would like to just bring out some thoughts and some things even some of the things that were or whether you mentioned by our pastor just trying to see if we can add something this morning that could be helpful to us I want to speak on the the endtime manifestation the endtime manifestation as we read the Bible in Isaiah we realized that there was a promise that God made to them all that will come to him and and even as we read in Luke 17 30 the scripture speaks that what happened in the time of Lord will come in this time and we can certainly sit here this morning and realize that we live in a time of manifestation you know I was looking for quote in the back I just it just came to my mind but a Brenham speaks I believe it's Israel in the church he spoke about even Moses the coming of Moses to Israel he speaks about the children of Israel being in bondage it says they came he said that you would look and perhaps they were in bondage in and for 400 years and sitting there and then he makes a statement he says but when the hour of deliverance came he says that those great God cogs of prophecy was grinding up towards the time God was not a minute late he was not a minute early he did it exactly the time that he planned to do it and and that gives us comfort to know that we are not here gonna be here a moment late or a moment early that everything that will happen will happen according to the prophecy so he brings forth and he says you can look at the children of israil housing Kame that everything worked out to be exactly as God planned it you know one of the scriptures or one of the stories that comes to mind is also of Lazarus it was the case where men could have looked at and say perhaps that for sure that it was late that time that that everything that happened that if he had just shown up before he died and and perhaps he had shown up just right after he died something gonna happen and but we realized that he showed up even after death to show you that even after death a man was already dead but because it was according to a prophecy because it was according to something that God showed him that God was still on time and it gives us comfort this morning because we are here according to a prophecy we are here according to something that God promised he will do in our time and we have to find the same comfort to know that regardless of what state we are in this morning it is not too late it's according to God's time and is here to fulfill the things that he said he will do as we read in Isaiah he he God comes here in his fix and says that oh that has the rain cometh in me and the waters to stir the field and it comes and it goes over the dudes and all those things and and he gives the seed to the Soron and and all of those things they said so are my words when they go forth they don't return to me void unless they accomplish the reason why I spoke it I tell you this morning we should find comfort in every word of God that he's spoken to us we should this morning have common and that everything that has spoken about us and for us that he will come to pass if God promised us healing and he says it's a healer we can hold on to that word and know that it will come to pass the scripture says heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away I think often time we think about God as a man you know we'll say so many vain words and we'll say do so many things said in fact we'll have thoughts and forget about them and all those things but we realize that God is not so as we read in Isaiah he says that your thoughts are not my thoughts and and and just it says my thought just as the heavens is far from the earth my thoughts are higher than your heart and I want to say this morning we need to put some God thinking within our thoughts we need to be lifted up from the earth because we so many times roughly pound and we think in terms of counting and numbers and this and this and and God is inviting us to be lifted up into his talk so we can see what it's saying so we realize it's the seed time and as we read it and I want to say this this morning the the manifestation time or the endtime manifestation it brings us into a condition perhaps that's different from the other ages in a sense that we realize but when I'm closed this time the harvest time because this time it's the reaping time if this is not necessarily a time when anything is being soared but it's the time where everything that was sword is being manifested everything that was planted everything that was put into the ground we have come to a time where all of that is coming into manifestation now he speaks and now he says he speaks about the the condition the Bible speaks in Matthew 24 and and and we're just going to skip some for the second time and then it says for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many and he shall hear wars and rumors of wars and ye shall and and ye be not you be not troubled for this things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation the Kingdom against Kingdom and they shall come and famine and pestilence and earthquakes in and in diverse places it speaks again in FEMA t chapter 3 we're going to pick up from verse 2 it says for many shall be lovers of their own selves and and covetous in and bolsters and proud and blasphemers and disobedient of parents and untenable and unholy without the natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent it says fear despising of those things that are good it says traitors highly high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having the form of godliness but denying the power thereof for such turn away so we can read the scripture this morning and we can go in the Bible and it says and we can look across the land and say that this scripture is fulfilled today why because now the scene was not sown at the end time the end time was not the time that the seed was to be sold the end time was the time where the manifestation of all these things was to be taking places so we can look at what Paul's spoken what Paul is referring to here in the Bible what Matthew is referring to in the Bible and stand here this morning and say that we see that you know we just had a little episode here with cover 19 and all the same we can go back to the Bible and say we see that why because the scripture have been fulfilled in our very eyes we have seen that God's Word is true we have seen that the things that he said II will come to pass have come to pass so we can rest assure and I want to say this morning it's not just good enough for us to look at those things and look at the negative and see God in it because that's what often times our minds tend to go to when we see it out in the world we believe it we see it and we can recognize it but yet what God is doing within our midst and in our own flash we fail to recognize that word from the past oftentimes we have the ability to see God afar off in other people and working and doing according to his promise in the end time people getting saved and people getting delivered but yet we come to a place it becomes difficult for the promise that was meant for us for us to accept it and often time we fall into our own mind and we begin to say well perhaps I'm not good enough for it and this was just not that time well how can I be this and be this at the same time how can I do this and react our way at the same time and I want to say this morning that's what the devil wants you to do this morning he wants you to be caught between two opinions and never coming to the realization and the belief or what the promise word for the hour is he wants you to be tossed to and fro always looking always comparing always thinking and always that's why the scripture says that your thoughts are not my talk what we need to do this morning in put God's talk in a thought but God minded on behind because God minds will bring his promise worth to come the past so it continues on as we rely as we say we realized that those seeds were sown before and now it's a manifesting time we're running fixing the message the endtime seeds time again I'm just for the sake of time I'm trying to just read the parts that I have need of it says jesus says jesus said that there'll be fearful sign sites in heaven and many hearts felling fear and perplexity in time of distress it says between nation don't you see those seed time it says don't you see that see time is here now harvest time the things that the Bible will say will come to pass he says that seed has been planted now I want to just be careful in a way I say this when we say seek time it doesn't mean that it's the seed that was planted what it means the seed time it means what was planted is coming back into the manifestation at seed time in other words if an apple was planted when you say it's C time it means we have seen an Apple come to the manifestation now because when the seed was planted we didn't know what seed went into the ground we didn't know what seed went into the crowd because the scripture tell us it's by their fruit that you shall know them when we see them on Afra station then we know what seed went into the ground so the things that was spoken the things that were made that was spoken even about this day we see them come to pass he says now in the message god of this evil age he says the two spirits one of them the Holy Spirit the other one is the devil Spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making the choices and now that's the time that we live in people have to make the decision as a believer we have to make our decisions we can't be caught between two opinions forever we have to make a decision whether what God said is true whether we'll believe what the promise is whether we believe what is made main known unto us or we'll continue to work in our own minds and continue to think our own thoughts it continue to try to figure this thing out so he says they have to make their choice he says the Holy Spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ that's the time when we living in the Holy Spirit this year calling out a bride for Christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her now it's not a lie and I want to be very very clear on where we're going because he's making it clear by making beyefendi heading the word to her what word the promise word of yahuwah what was what was spoken for that time was what the word said about the time that they were living in what it was supposed to transpire the things that were though they were supposed to see that's what he's making it clear to her it says for this age showing that Christ showing that it is Christ he says he says if a finger is supposed to move in this age the finger will move if the foot is worse to move in this age the foot will move it says if the eye is supposed to see in this age the eye will see the spirit of as it grows into the full stature of God is the age that we are living in now the Holy Spirit is here Vanda cating the message of the hour it says and the Holy Spirit is doing it so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos why is he doing it to get you out of the chaos now I want to say this this morning the scripture tells us that when the bride when that believer at the end time when she recognizes who she is I asked you this morning how do you come to the recognition of who you are it's this Holy Spirit speaking to you showing you the funding carat word of the hour showing you what is culture to be in the end time showing you what the promised hour for the ages and in you believing it that's when you come into the realization and I want to say this is Laurie we recognize that the world is falling apart and that's wonderful we recognize that everything is set in motion and that's wonderful and I tell you this morning it's about time we begin to realize who we are - it's about time we begin to act out what the switcher is talking about us if we can see how the world is falling if we can see how the things are going if we can see all of those manifestation don't fail to see this other manifestation and that is God moving within your being why because you are the manifestation of Christ for this hour there's no scripture that it says that Jesus will comment and you will walk in the flesh of Galilee but he will work with the robe and there people will see it in fact Birmingham says see if one come with Mal Scott hand in his hand he's an impostor he's a liar but the manifestation of this hour is Christ well with and his bride doing the same signs and wonders that he promised he will do it this time it's Christ veiled within your flesh doing the purpose of the hour that's what the world says it's going to be in the end time so he speaks and he says it says he's supposed to move he will move to get you out of the chaos it says but the devil are the Holy Spirit he's here calling his church by error he's here to saw the error to misinterpret the Word of God to bring a different understanding his ear says as usual by perverting of the Word of God like he did in the beginning see it comes right back to that seed time again he says from Eden he's here again so we realized that's what that time is that time of manifestation is to come in plain view again the scripture tells us in Matthew 13 and 30 says this is the parable of the seat Ronnie says after the master is so nice he didn't the workers went and they realized that there was stair that was sown into the ground and then it's there they asked her master she would go in and go and plug it up and and here's the answer that Jesus says he's given to them it says let them grow together until the harvest time and in the time of harvest they have they will they will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them to bind them bind them in bundles to be burned by gather their seed into them into my porn now is specifically speaking about what is supposed to be how that the the the denomination of the seed will be gather up how that the tear will be gather up together first and the seed will go into the barns but what random speaks about this timing is in the message the the the spoken word in the original seed he he makes mention of three seeds that were planted he speaks he says that I believe that is is near the harvest time and the seed have been planted again he's making very clear that the seed was already planted the seed was already planted he says denominational seed of the church such as defense evangelical like the Baptist and the Presbyterian and Lutheran and others and other the Pentecostals so there was a the evangelical seed and then there was the Pentecostal seed that had been planted into the Pentecost organization by great men like Oral Roberts and Tommy Hicks and Tommy Osmond great man it says great man of God and I believe that the word has been planted now he recognizes the planting of the other seed but he said but I also recognized that the word was also planted and and he says that the word was planted has been planted unadulterated away from any organization that's what the matter the seed must be planted it says the seed must be planted water before it could grow he must be watered he must have water to fall before the seed have been planted to grow now I want to say this you you cannot expect and harvest unless you plant a seed first we we we cannot have a harvest time unless there was a planting time that took place now it's big here and and it says that it must be planted and then he continues on it says the seed must be planted and it must be watered in order to grow and it says it says now you say well for Brenham I'm going to express your thought here and the water that's correct and it says skip on he says but now wait we did have in the planting time the form of rain it says if you look at the world the word in intro chapter 2 when he speaks about the form of rain it says the Hebrew raters Maura which means the teaching rain he speaks about the teaching rain that went forth he made now makes this statement the denomination teaching rain has went forth a million in 44 it says the Baptist and so-and-so members of the church are Robert and and and them brothers in the Pentecostal movement in the economy become economic and then it says the great Pentecostal movement they moved into the millions that's right and the seed has been the see that as went forth and as when forth the word for the minority their group now it says then the kind of seed use you have you have planted in the field will be the kind of crop that you will rip it says if the denomination wants more members it says that's what they're going to get it says that's what they've gotten the Pentecost so one more Pentecostal and that's what they will get right but the word is going to produce sons and daughters of God that's coming to watch look at that great lot of rain supposed to be done here and it would run over the wall and leap over it says how that the great army is coming now this is 19 and 62 how the great army is coming and just a wait a minute the kind of crop is you go to get it is the kind of seed that you will put in the field now I just wanna want us this morning it's easy for us to just look at this morning and say you know you're is very descriptive speaking about the seed of the Pentecostal and the street are the seed of the Frangelico the Baptist's and the precipitation and all of them and we have to be careful this morning because we we ourselves have to every word of God applies to all of us we understand that when the word comes was it comes and we have to look at it and be able to see ourselves and make sure we pay attention to what it says and and this morning we the Pentecostal seed and the Baptist seed the reason why brother Branham is representing all those two it's because denomination it was a group of people that put God into a box it was a group of people that determine the boundary of what God can function and confront cannot function it was a group of people that had an understanding about anything that didn't a fill up their understanding or they teaching or their doctrine they kicked it out but we have to be careful that we find ourselves we don't find ourselves in that same box yet we are saying it was denominational Steve but yet we are sitting here and the promise word has been spoken to us and here we are putting God in the box and and then thinking well can God really do that is that really mean and cannot really happen to me God has promised this in the end time will not really be to be able to manifest those things we have to be careful that we don't find ourselves in the same box that these people were in because this is just not a safe a nametag but this is the behavioral or the attitude of of a believer towards the Word of God the attitude was they didn't want to believe the full Word of God they didn't want to believe realized that God can do the impossible it was a group of people that only believe certain things and rejected a part of the word but it said but the right seed has been shown because in the end time that will come a group of people and they will believe every word of God they'll believe all that's of them and it will manifest that why would they manifest it because they will believe it it's not according to their own strength it's because they believe he was a word he said we're bringing to pass and that's what was attributed to Abraham as righteousness I want to say this morning you know oftentimes we think about Abraham and everything well we realize that even as we read Luke 17 and 30 there because it says what happened whoever ahem will happen to his seed it's the same thing that happened what was the faith of every hand build upon it was built on the simple fact that this man in his life amazed us like we are heard the word of God God spoke to him something that didn't make any sense something that he didn't have a frame of reference that he can attribute it to it and say yes this match is there so yes I had heard this before no it was somebody with no frame of reference just believed the Word of God and in believing the Word of God faith was created within his heart and God brought back to pass everything that he said he was gonna do to him and I want to say this this morning ever him knew that God everything that God said unto him will come to pass why because when he come and asked him to offer his son ever had when and did it why because the scripture says that he believed that God who gave him I said from the dead that the same God is able to raise Isaac from the dead why because he was a promise huh why because he was what God promised he would come to pass oh I wonder this morning if we can come to the realization that what God promised for us is going to come to pass what God said this hour will come to pass will come to pass why because he's God and he promised it he continues on it says but the world but the word will say now he uses this that's all Robert now he brings into Plainview the other one he says but the the word will stay with the elect the royal seed Emin jesus says as it was in the days of sodom socially be in the coming of the son of man so he puts his focus on this as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the way in the days of the son of man he speaks out it continues on it says we believe that we are in the end time do we he asked the congregation and they said amen he says the do you believe do you believe that before you have a crop now you have to plant seed amen see why he says you see why I've let I've let the churches turn me out tell me everything call me all kinds of name everything else just stay right with the word amen there is a plant seed has been planted it's already planted friends it's already done this is 19 and 62 he's letting you know that he the seed was already they called him all kinds of name they called him all kinds of things that rejected him and all those things but he knew what his message was and he knew the purpose of his calling he was so he can plant that unadulterated seed and he was confident that he did that that he planted that seed and he says and I say it now it's over it says right she's done been planted all yes and it says and so is the denominational and the rest of them he's now confirming that this seed has been planted this seed that I'm talking about has been planted in and there's no reason for you to wonder why because I've stayed with the things that I've been told I've stayed and I preached exactly what I've been told I have done everything that God has called me to do I have come here and preached the word exactly like he taught me to preach it now I want you now to realize a shift that happened in a marriage in the image in the message the the marriage of the Lamb but when I'm says he makes this statement he says he says and now this is after reading the scripture I believe he read the scripture and everything it says and and and it says and now we know that there's going to be a bride now it's not asking a question whether there shall be a bride if the bride will will it come if we don't know what exactly will bring forth the bride he says we know that there was there's going to be a bride and that there's going to be a wedding supper in the skies he matched those two absolute statement to let you know that these things are going to come to pass there is going to be a bride and it's going to be a wedding supper and then he says that's just as sure to be as God is because here's the word he says and we know the doors that are going to make up the bride is going to be in his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle all they have I said and they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready united side now what you to just if we can just dissect this for a moment the messenger now is coming he's making it clear to the believer he's making it clear to the people in the audience that you need to know insurance we are sitting here as sure as we can confirm that we are able to see the outside and see the seed that was sown and be able to see the endtime conditions and be the sodom and gomorrha to be able to see all kinds of the parts and everything even in the church see the gathering of both the tares and all those things it says that that we have to come to an understanding and I believe that there was a promise for the wedding supper that there's going to be a bride and he's going to be at the wedding supper those two things will not miss and I'll say this you might as well know what you're you want to count yourself in and out I don't want to say this that's not gonna be one more seed extra or once it lasts we're not gonna get there and say oh we didn't know you were gonna be here let's get another chair no but just as sure as God knows what I just gonna be that and it says here that we need to know for certainty that there's going to be a bride but that's going to be a wedding supper you know and in the scene of God was think you should say I want to be part of that I'm part of that how do you know I tell you you have to come to a place where you add it all up together where you come from and how you got here and where you going a new trajectory and be able to decide within yourself is this God or is it not God we can't be caught up within our own minds and find out how do we go from here and what's happening here as as far as making the absolute statement he's wanting to let you know that these things are going to happen this world has an expiration date the scripture says so the scripture tells us that many of them says where is the promise of his coming for since our father died it seems like everything continues the same but we find out that that's that was the mind of people that's what the mind of man does to them but the scripture tells us that it's going to coming in and we know that will happen so as he speaks it says that will come a bride and she will be and there will be a wedding supper there has to be something within us that recognizes that word to be and say I'm part of that I'm part of the wedding supper and I like this and he says and and and they have the material the word on earth now to make themselves ready if you notice she has made herself ready and I just want to ask you this question are we making the necessary preparation in order for us to be there I want to say this morning if I was invited to a party and if I knew what time and what date that party was going to be in I would make the necessary preparation and I just want to ask us this morning you know I was thinking about this covered 19 and stuff it seems like it was just a dead space and you know time of questioning and everything and if we are not careful we will drop down and pick up exactly where we left off and continue with our lives with all kind of the devil trying to cause all kinds of beasts innocent and I gotta go here I got to do this and if we are absolutely sure that we're going to be at this wedding supper then there has to be a preparation made you say what preparation the scripture says that the bride has made herself ready by what by the word that she has received and I want to say this if you expecting a baby if you know there's a baby coming you go by the crib and you're gonna go find a place where the baby is going to sleep and you'll go get the clothing of where the baby is gonna be dressing and you'll do all the necessary preparation why you know the baby's coming why you know you expecting something you know and I wonder sometimes if our lives express what we are preparing for if we are this morning I know anticipation I'm expecting that rupture to happen any minute I'm expecting him to break out any minute the scripture said it can happen in the twinkling of an eye I wonder if we make the preparation how do you prepare yourself if you invite me to your place I want to know what the visit is all about I want to know if I want to bring something I want to know what is this all about and and all those things the invitation is in the word that you receive that's what you get ready for if you know you're gonna have somebody over you transmit the message over that person is getting ready and you are getting ready to receive them and so is the Word of God of this hour that's going to be a bride and those I've received a message themselves ready we cannot kid ourselves and do all kinds of things and live all kinds of life with no thoughts at all about the wedding supper and expect to just wake up one morning and find ourselves at the table the Scriptures the brightest weather sounds ready how by the word that she has received in the word tells you what kind of dress you need to have when you show up the word tells you what kind of character you need to have when you show up the word makes you ready but well that's the work in you the word provides what you have need of in order for you to be there all you need is an invitation this morning how many of receive that invitation this one is that I have and I'm making my son's ready by eating his world follow instruction by knowing what kind of shoes I need to have in what kind of trust I need to conduct myself what kind of attitude I need why I have received the world that's that's what we need to be about we are people that have received something we're not just left in our own mind whether it's a forward and not what is yet to prepare us now I just I just want to make a lip because I'm running out of time the scripture says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God but when I'm speaking the message who's this Melchizedek it says God was with this heart but they intent of God from the beginning was to him to become flesh was always for the world to become flesh but whatever even tells us the word manifested is light we just read it it's the word manifested that's light life is understanding light is illuminating something that helps you see that helps you understand where you're going so now we are here the touch of God and they have to be manifested into flesh but yet within between the thoughts and the flesh manifestation that's what is known as the word what is the word is the thought of God Express and now I just want to get your attention for a minute so as long as God is not expressive we don't know what the thought is when God is not expressive we don't know what the thought is as if when he said let there be light it was the thought being expressed and now that became light and the light becomes a life of men so now we realize that same we are here if we unless we've heard the word you're gonna send me unless we don't know what for thought was but the message of the hour the Word of God revealed to us what the thoughts of God was now it just didn't reveal what the thought of God was because the Word of God has creative power to understand the Word of God has creative power but when I'm says that when God said let her be he says that God believes this one word as he spoke dead even leave the short word in other words when the word of God was it was coupled with the face of God attached to it so that when he went out and brought to exactly what God wanted to see so is every word of God the school whatever live it was hahaha it's coupled with the faith to bring forth what God wants to see it's couple words what God wants to see manifested come to manifestation so if God say that's gonna be a bride this I think I can stop it if we just don't we never heard it that's wonderful then we don't know but EFS it and we can find it in a Bible then we can hang on to it because that God won't become manifest we can cut up within ourselves so many times that's why I fight us this morning so we can put on the mind of God and the thoughts of God which are very high than our thoughts the scripture speaks about the foolish and wise virgins the very first thing that strikes you when you read that is that there were all virgins so it wasn't the fact that the way virgins made them all qualified the word went forth the virgins heard it but it was he who made themselves ready by the word that they had received was the one who went in the one who took lightly the invitation that went forth and just stay there because when the script when the voice says here comes a bridegroom going out to meet him the scripture says that they trimmed their lap the word that went forth caused these virgins to trim the lamp and be ready and make sure they had oil but the foolish version heard the same word and never made ready and I hope this morning we can see where we're coming to it's he who makes themselves ready he who takes the word within their hearts ever have believed the Word of God regardless of which situation and I'm not talking about making ready as in something that you have to produce because remember God will not take anything that man has to produce so what this is all about what this is all about is to receive the word because remember the Prophet tells us that when you receive the word you become the word you eat the word you become the word the word has the face of God attached to it to bring forth what God is desiring to see it says God has God it says it says God has gotten amazing grace to save you and says everybody will not do it but you will fight every inch of your way it says I've been behind the pulpit going thirty 31 years and every inch of that has been fight constantly it certainly has I'm not speaking about a perfect world where you just woke up I'm the bride I'm the ride I'm speaking about when the enemy comes in like a flood when you feel like well I just acted like a complete unbeliever I just I just don't deserve this there's no way that's what moves me about what brother Matthew was preaching on on Wednesday it's just to come to the realization oh I hear the stings and I see their sayings oh there's just the one like me someone I says you look at your own just where he got you from and where he pulled you from and all the things all the mistakes and all your ups and downs but you realize absent Downs didn't stop Abraham from believing the promise and if we didn't stop ever ahem you will not stop the seed of Abraham why because the same scene I was identifying ever have that same seed is identifying these children will not stop the up and down they have the mind fed up and nothing can stop them the same way that God speaks it I think and stop him nothing can stop this people why because they are believers that would make you believe there's nothing too great for them I want to say this fear this morning that's no challenge to lay the Prophet tells us that the Word of God the manifested Word of God the message of the hour will meet the challenge of the hour I ask you this morning what's your challenge you just take the word whatever that challenges there's no one here to meet the challenge there's no one here to produce what God promised let's not take ourselves and put ourselves in and then drop ourselves down we are here because God wanted us to be here I always say this and I'll say it again a man cannot put this kind of people together a day's nomadic mathematical model or an algorithm that you can run for you to have all these people here together the only thing that can do it is God and if God is able to do it if he's able to bring you here this morning oh I tell you this morning when I woke up I made my preparation to coming here from God why because there's something within my heart beating I want to be at the wedding satphone I want to sit at that table I know that's my heart display not for it I know that the place will be over there we-we'd the Word of God is higher than our thoughts he says let don't let the devil bring in confusion don't let the devil get you focused upon your own self God is not asking you to come up with the remedy the remedy is provided that we may take the word that we may obey the word and see ourselves over there he says in the message in the message the seat is not Airy to shock he says he says Revelation chapter 10 the full word is to be borne into manifestation again it says and vindicated by the Spirit of God in the full in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth he manifested it says manifested in the same way doing the same thing that he did when he was you're on earth a many brewster's in an a that says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I want to just let us know this morning we you don't have to look outside of yourself for the manifestation of Jesus Christ in this hour that's not the promise of this age the Bible tells us in Birmingham uses it it says in that day shall know that I am in my father and my father knew it says all that God was he poured into Christ and then he says all that Christ was he poured into his church his body in other word he's body becomes the full function of Christ Christ Himself the head of the body and the body is manifesting exactly what they had did the body is here not doing his own works not singing its own glory but the body is here to manifest what the head is in other words if you want to see the Christ you have to look into his body and I want to say this this morning however and whether you feel you have to come to the realization that you are the one that's called to do that the word is here to make you into that you have to take the preparation you have to take that word and say God I heard this and your word closed for this and I don't see that in my life I'm taking the word because I believe that that's me we can't just go and come and go and expect God to just drop out in the sky and do some wonderful things that's not biblical so here you go know the word will you said if we believe the world if we stay with the word he says it continues on it says the world is in the sudden condition in the church went into Sodom with it and lot and his wife and I say that is in a light search somewhere who's work who's in the world that's pulling out aside from all those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention we are in the last day what's attracting you attention what is drawing you what is it that's motivating you what gives you one wakes you up in the morning well what is the heartbeat of your heart what is it that that just works you up in and that you you look forward to when you work up is it your job is that the things around you is it going to work and pay your bills and all those things as long as you do that then you satisfy I say there's a higher calling than that there's a higher place and it's calling us than that let's not be fearful let's not look down upon ourselves let's look at the word and let the word produce yourself it says now if you if you have those attributes of God we cannot live by creative we cannot live by denomination we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride oh I love this the manifestation of this hour what is that word bride is the manifestation of this hour I'm telling you I'll say like I said last time when Birmingham says it says all I'm so hungry I'm so desiring to see the Spirit of God moves why because the Spirit will come and make us into this witness into the place where we can manifest these things this Bible tells us that my words are spirit and truth so when you receive the Word of God there's a spirit of God that will come and confirm what you ever see this is the manifestation of this hour it's you you are what God has been planning question mister of God revealed here is Christ revealing God in the beginning now remember it was the son who came out of God the logos he says as the son sitting at the doorstep and the only everything that we knew about the father came from the Sun everything that we knew about God the Sun revealed him and I want to say to you this morning everything that we'll find out about Christ about his character its ability and all that it can do he's blessed it into a body so they can reveal him he came he was the fulfillment of the Old Testament and I want to say this you are the fulfilling before everything that I spoke about in the New Testament and we have to believe that you say that's hard I say wonderful you believe the hard things you believe what seems impossible you believe what you cannot understand take your heart and exploded and break now work to come to pass why because it's not for you to bring it out it's heaven you manifesting is what Christ said I do nothing except what the father showed him this bride can do nothing except Christ comes and manifest himself to her it says but it will come it will come that it is the promise of this age we are living in the church we are living in the age that is coming that his coming will be in she must be identified in him a woman must be identified with her husband for the two are one and Christ Christ bride has to be identified with him for the 2r1 he is the word not a denomination the word we are we are to be the children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age we do know lights we do know light except it is from the word all right the word made flesh is light of the age when we see it in the Bible and the Bible said so the Holy Spirit is here on earth looking for those individuals that had ordained that God had ordained to life in this age he says as it says and as soon as it finds it it does it just exactly like he did on Jesus Christ the great super son of God who redeemed us all it comes down and he takes the place and abodes in the human life now notice a breath brought the quickening power now the quickening power that come upon Jesus quicken him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so that's the Holy Ghost so that's the Holy Spirit that comes upon us in this day if it's not the mockery of the Holy Spirit you are not the devil holy mockery if it's not the devil marking the Holy Spirit but the real one the true Holy Spirit it will manifest the promise of this our West why is it difficult because we look to the flesh because we get caught up in the flesh but I want to remind us this morning that there's a Holy Spirit here to bring the word forth into manifestation there is a word here making a bride ready for her to go into the rapture if the musician could come you look in the Bible you realize because the question we asked ourselves this morning is why me why is he calling me and how do I even get there I say just like you provided the word to Abraham to get him there he provided the word to get you there when God created Adam I want you to realize that even when Adam woke up it says God said the scripture says that God put him to sleep and he took out a rib out of him and he made of Eve and he brought Eve to Adam Eve didn't show up before Adam and say hey look at me I'm such-and-such I'm this and I'm the church I'm your bride I this she never said a word she just stood there and the scripture says that the bridegroom looked at Eve and he says this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone her identity came from Adam Adam told her who she was Hatem gave her hair identification and all did Eve did was to accept it and believe what Adam said and I was good enough for her she walked and she acted exactly according to Adams word she did everything exactly how Adam told her she acted like a bride she talked like a bride she did all of that why because the word that came out of Adam she believed it and I'm telling you in this end time we didn't call ourselves bride we didn't what we were we didn't even know anything about the bride we didn't know anything about the church we didn't even know if some of us didn't even know anything about the Bible we just heard a few stories here and there but all when he came just like he came to I when he called Nathaniel it says behold an Israelite in whom there is no guile he looked at in the column so he says when did you know me he said before Philip knew you before Philip find you when you were under the tree and I'm telling you in the invisible union where a bottom speaks now when he makes mention of you he doesn't say met you under the tree in the tree is saying talking about a bride that he knew before the foundation of the world you are a people and I want to say this you are put in this place so you can be tempted and if you attempted this morning that's all right that's the purpose why you were put in the flesh but no let the temptation overtake you because within the flesh crud clay something that is called the seed of God that is supposed to return and believe the Word of God so when he came to you he spoke about your natural marriage he said oh you were born and as far as a woman lives she cannot this force this husband and it goes through all the time and it shows you how impossible it is for you to get there it shows you how that your flesh can never get there this shows you the other is coming out your flesh already it's nothing to do it your flesh but he said all but before the foundation of the world I want to say this God the Creator he created his own Drive everything that he knew the bride was gonna name he married in the beginning we are here as the finished product of what was spoken we are not here to invent anything new let's see that you are what's the scene I was planning in the beginning all you have to do is just received the word and burst out of that natural flesh and receive your word why because the scene that he knew was splendid by him in the beginning so that he can come in this time and say you are my bride let's all send this morning we didn't make ourselves wide none of us woke up and you know I said oh god I'm your bottom over I know he called you he told you that he elected you he predestinated you and I want to say this morning he further just improved you this morning we have received the invitation we know what the invitation the invitation tells you what the requirements are and the invitation provides the material that is needed in order for you to be ready I want to say this morning let's walk according to the invitation let's eat that invitation let's take that invitation when when the scripture says in heaven when when when John was there and he says that he came and he says there was no one to take the book the scripture says that he knew that who whose name was on the book he knew that his name was on the book and if no one took the book that the salvation will not come that everything that Jesus taught what is in brain therefore by the lamb taking the book now I want to just say this this morning the left of the book nothing had happened yet nothing had happened yet he had not opened the sails by by taking the book they began to rejoice why because they realize that and we say not to what promised it was gonna talked about everything that this lamb died for that the blade will be come to a fully proficient and therefore that's why we have to come this morning when we read the word and realize what he's doing within our time when we read the promise of the hour we got a rejoicing to that why because everything that the word says he will come to pass why because it's no longer just a thought it's been spoken and if it's been spoken right it's going to come back god bless should have smoked let's just my hat our gracious father was so thankful Lord Lord I could certainly say like Paul was shall we say this morning for time we'll fellas said we could talk about the Gideon and hft and all of them the messenger picks that up and he says that all those people wanted to come and live in this age what was so glorious about this age load the bride that I fell in the beginning in the Garden of Eden there was gonna come another one who is gonna defeat the devil in her own garden in a home Eden nor do we look ourselves and we don't see much might we don't see any power by Lord we believe the word we thank you this morning because we are believers and old whatever the word says we'll take it in our heart and ask that you manifest yourself we will commit everything we are to ask you bless the people and I said in the name of Jesus Christ this morning let's just see [Music] all Spirit of God [Music] we just want to read this testimony says praise the Lord when we arrived at church immediately dahlias foot was better and was walking with no issue thank God for His healing hand a man raised the Lord now maybe in your carnal mind somebody just wants to chalk that up to coincidence oh the carnal mind is enmity with God so I have to rebuke myself all the time oh you hear a testimony go forth through Mike oh well that was the doctors or that was this or that Oh sometimes we just need to rebuke our flesh and just and just appeal to that inner man and say you know what God just performed a supernatural word oh we rejoice in that now to start thinking of yourselves maybe what your need oh here's a little testimony the word has gone forth I say the waters been stirred the Lord has gone forth are we just gonna pack her bags and run out and find out what's for lunch are we gonna appreciate what God has coming what he said this morning and say Lord the waters have been stirred the word has went forth and now Lord I'm just gonna labor in your presence I'm gonna labor under this anointing I'm gonna labor here right here Lord so that you can continue to move upon my life and move upon my need and Lord Jesus whatever you have for me Lord I believe your word all aren't you aren't you so thankful for the word that's gone forth why don't we just give them praise why don't we just worship a lot of juice lift their hands to him why do you start praising them for this testimony oh we thank the Lord Lord Jesus thank you for touching our little sister this morning father there was a prayer request that went forward but Lord we've witnessed your healing virtue that flows from Calvary this morning Lord and I believe there's other needs that are represented here this morning Lord we lifted our hands up to you Lord and we're asking Lord and believing according to that word that it would be manifest Lord we just heard the word go forward that the word has been spoken that there's going to be a bride and that it's manifesting time Lord and we believe we are the manifestation of that word that has been spoken we are believers Lord Jesus and we're believing for divine healing Lord we're believing for our family Lord we're believing for all these precious promises that you have given unto the believer to be manifested in our life Lord we are believers Lord we rejoice in your promise word that has come forth Lord O God we just want to worship you in spirit and truth for a little bit what we believe the waters have been stirred Lord if there's somebody here that has a need or there's a promise that you said that we shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's not man's words that's your words ruler Jesus and here's our people that are standing upon that promised word to say I believe it go oh god may your water just continue to

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] where's that Sita there predestinated seed inside of you now we start to listen to what the word said was in that seed you know there's rapture in that seed that's what this message has come to do is rapture and catch away a bride and we get so caught up on everything around us but when we start looking at our brother Billy said how eve was standing there oh she she maybe didn't know she didn't know anything she didn't know where she came from she didn't even know why she was standing there but then all of a sudden her headship came unto her her husband and said your bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh you realize that's what the message is done in this hour oh where were you at we were scattered about the nations of the earth didn't know where we come from didn't know why we we weren't satisfied we couldn't understand why our life was so confusing and why was so peculiar why nothing in the world would satisfy us we tried this and we try that and then one day oh Jesus Christ came and said you are flesh of my flesh your bone of my bone your life of my life you are my bride and all of a sudden we started looking at him who's our identification and we see everything that's in him and he's telling us we are him and we look at ourselves and we start to worry about all of our conditions and all of us off and all of my failure sorry the anointing scale up again I better stop all that we get to looking around and we start looking at our faults and our failures and he says just look at me just look at me I'm your identification and as we start looking at that word he just keeps telling us you're an overcomer you can do all things through Jesus Christ oh just restin me come unto me all you who are heavy laden and I will give us rash quit listening to the things of the world I've already spoken the word and nothing can stop that word from coming to pass and you are that word that is coming into manifestation in the end time oh what a glorious thing Oh hallelujah would you say a quick prayer of dismissal Heavenly Father we rejoice in your word to know that you have called us Lord you've elected us and you've chosen us to think Lord Jesus that you had a thought in your mind before the world had ever formed that you want to do achieve a bride not only achieve a bride that you would achieve a bride in the wickedness most darkest time that the world had ever known well you'd predestinate a bride that could not fall you'd predestinate a bride that would overcome you predestinated a bride that would be able to set their wings to the winds of faith and arise above it all order rejoicing in that Lord we rejoice that we're living in the manifesting time of those seeds and that we are your word seed that is coming into maturity we love you now Lord we rejoice in that we ask a blessing upon the people now as they would go in Jesus Christ's name we pray well [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
