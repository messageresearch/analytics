[18:58] When the night comes,
[19:02] when you're all alone,
[19:06] when there's trouble,
[19:10] stirring in your soul.
[19:15] And if your world is
[19:19] falling apart,
[19:24] just hold on
[19:26] for the morning breaks to dawn.
[19:32] Come and lay your burdens
[19:37] down.
[19:40] to the place where freom
[19:44] is found.
[19:48] At the feet, at the feet of Jesus,
[19:56] come and lay your burden
[20:01] still.
[20:12] Deepest sorrow
[20:16] weighs on your heart.
[20:20] When you've prayed for answers,
[20:23] but the answers haven't come
[20:28] for every tear
[20:32] that you cry.
[20:36] There's a promise.
[20:39] He will make your burdens of light.
[20:44] Come and lay your burdens
[20:49] down
[20:52] to the place where freom
[20:57] is found.
[21:00] At the feet, at the feet of Jesus.
[21:08] Come and lay your burdens
[21:12] down.
[21:15] Oh, lay them down.
[21:20] Lay them down.
[21:23] Oh, lay them down.
[21:26] Oh, lay them down
[21:32] at the feet at the feet of Jesus.
[21:40] Come and lay your burdens
[21:44] down.
[21:48] When we see him
[21:52] face to face,
[21:56] all our worries, they will surely fade
[22:00] away.
[22:03] Oh, in the presence
[22:07] of his glorious light,
[22:11] we'll sing hallelu
[22:14] to the one who gave us life.
[22:19] Oh, come and lay your burdens
[22:24] down
[22:27] to the place where freom
[22:31] is found.
[22:34] Oh, at the feet, at the feet of Jesus,
[22:43] come and lay your burdens
[22:47] down.
[22:50] Oh, at the feet at the feet of Jesus.
[23:00] Why don't you lay your burdens
[23:06] down?
[23:09] Come and lay
[23:11] your burdens
[23:15] down.
[23:57] So many times I question
[24:01] certain circumstances
[24:04] and things I could not understand.
[24:12] Many times in trials,
[24:16] weakness blurs my vision and my
[24:20] frustration
[24:22] gets so out of hand.
[24:28] It's then I am reminded
[24:31] I've never been forsaken.
[24:35] I've never had to stand a test alone.
[24:42] And when I look at all the victories,
[24:47] the spirit rises up in me. And it's
[24:51] through the fire my weakness is made
[24:55] strong.
[25:03] He never promised that the cross would
[25:07] not get heavy
[25:09] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[25:18] He never offered
[25:21] a victory without fighting. The heat
[25:24] said hell would always come in time.
[25:31] So just remember when you're standing
[25:35] in the valley of decision
[25:39] and the adversary
[25:41] is gi.
[25:45] Just hold on.
[25:49] Our Lord will show up
[25:53] and he will take you through the fire
[25:57] again.
[26:02] I know within myself that I will surely
[26:06] perish
[26:08] if I trust the hand of God.
[26:12] He'll shield the flame again.
[26:18] again.
[26:22] He never promised that the cross would
[26:26] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[26:31] hard to climb.
[26:37] He never offered
[26:40] a victory without fighting. But he said
[26:44] help would always come in time.
[26:50] So just remember when we're standing in
[26:54] the valley of decision
[26:58] and the adversaries
[27:01] gi.
[27:04] Just hold on.
[27:08] Our Lord will show up
[27:12] and he will take you through the fire
[27:16] again.
[27:21] He never promised that the cross would
[27:24] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[27:29] hard to climb.
[27:35] He never offered
[27:38] a victory without fighting. But he said
[27:42] help would always come in time.
[27:48] So just remember when you're standing
[27:52] in the valley of decision
[27:56] and the adversaries
[27:58] say G.
[28:02] Just hold on.
[28:06] Our Lord will show up
[28:10] and he will take you through the fire
[28:14] again.
[28:16] Just hold on.
[28:20] Our Lord will show up
[28:24] and he will take you through the fire
[28:28] again.
[28:39] Hallelujah.
[28:44] Isn't it a comfort to know he never lets
[28:46] you go alone,
[28:48] &gt;&gt; but he always comes with you?
[28:51] Hallelujah. We don't have any new
[28:53] written requests. We want to remember
[28:56] the ones that were spoken this morning
[28:57] and remember to keep Brother Billy in
[29:00] prayer as he was out ministering
[29:02] that he come back to us safely. If you
[29:04] have a need upon your heart and you want
[29:06] to make it known to the Lord by the
[29:08] uplifting of your hands,
[29:10] do so and know he sees and there's an
[29:13] answer coming for you. If the brothers
[29:16] that are taking the tithes and offerings
[29:17] would come up. Brother Caleb Miles, if
[29:18] you want to come up and pray for these
[29:44] Let's go to the Lord.

[29:56] Lord whenever the man came up to him
[30:00] Lord in the prayer line
[30:03] and he reminded him reminded him of his
[30:06] dad
[30:07] started sizing up his shoes and sizing
[30:11] up his coat and wanted to give it to him
[30:13] he didn't have any shoes on
[30:16] Lord Jesus
[30:19] Lord that's that's the love we have for
[30:21] one another Lord God,
[30:24] Lord, the the request,

[30:43] are ordered by you, Lord Jesus.
[30:46] Lord, as sons and daughters, we just
[30:48] claim the blood, Lord God, for healing,
[30:52] for salvation, Lord Jesus.
[30:55] Lord, I pray that you just meet every
[30:56] need in the service tonight, Lord God.
[30:58] Bless the tithes and the offerings, Lord
[31:01] God. May they go for your glory, Lord
[31:04] Jesus. I pray that you just be with the
[31:05] rest of the service, Lord God. And may

[31:15] Lord. Lord, we just put everything in
[31:16] your hands. Jesus Christ's name we pray.

[31:44] Sister Kaylee come with their special.

[32:10] and I receive it.
[32:16] Oh, he is here.
[32:25] Healing is here.
[32:32] Healing is here.
[32:38] I believe in.
[32:44] And so I reach my hands
[32:49] to the heavens.
[32:52] I lift my mind where my help comes from.
[32:59] My look to you. You are my rock, my
[33:04] healer.
[33:06] I trust in you.
[33:10] I reach my hands.
[33:12] I reached my hands
[33:16] to the heavens.
[33:20] Lift my eyes where my help comes from.
[33:26] I look to you. You are my rock, my
[33:32] healer.
[33:34] Trust in you.
[34:11] What do you say to
[34:15] feels like they've lost it all?
[34:19] over the edge with no one there to break
[34:24] their fall.
[34:27] And what do you say to someone
[34:31] who feels so unloved
[34:34] and giving themselves away a little bit
[34:37] every day just to be good enough?
[34:42] And what do you say to a hopeless soul
[34:46] who can't remember their way home? And
[34:50] everything is out of their control.
[34:56] There is no valley,
[35:00] there is no darkness,
[35:03] there is no sorrow
[35:06] greater than the grace of Jesus.
[35:11] There is no moment.
[35:14] There is no distance.
[35:18] There is no heartbreak.
[35:21] He can't take you through.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So before you think that you're too lost
[35:29] to save,
[35:32] remember there is nothing greater than
[35:37] grace.
[35:44] What do you say to someone whose life is
[35:49] on the line
[35:51] and they're unsure what happens after
[35:55] their last breath?
[35:59] What do you say to someone
[36:02] who's only known abuse
[36:05] when the walls they built to save
[36:08] themselves makes it hard to hear the
[36:11] truth?
[36:13] And what do you say to a life of regret
[36:16] that's trying so hard to forget? And
[36:20] what do you say to dreams unmet?
[36:26] That there is no valley,
[36:30] there is no darkness,
[36:33] there is no sorrow
[36:36] greater than the grace of Jesus.
[36:40] There is no moment.
[36:44] There is no distance.
[36:47] There is no heartbreak.
[36:50] He can take it through.
[36:55] So before you think that you're too lost
[36:59] to save,
[37:02] remember there is nothing greater than
[37:06] grace.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; There is no valley.
[37:16] There is no darkness.
[37:20] There is no sorrow
[37:23] greater than the grace of Jesus.
[37:27] There is no moment.
[37:30] There is no distance.
[37:34] There is no heartbreak.
[37:37] He can't take it through.
[37:42] So before you think that you're too lost
[37:45] to save.
[37:49] So before you think that you're too lost
[37:53] to save,
[37:56] remember there is nothing greater than
[38:00] grace.

[38:08] grace.

[40:36] deserve the glory. You deserve the glory
[40:43] and the honor.

[41:08] glory. We lift our hands in
[41:14] as we praise your holy name. You are
[41:20] great.
[41:22] You do miracles.
[41:27] There is no one else like you.
[41:34] There is no one else like you. Oh, and
[41:39] you are great.
[41:42] You do miracles so great.
[41:48] There is no one else like you.
[41:55] There is no one
[41:58] &gt;&gt; for you are great like you.
[42:03] Oh for you are great.
[42:08] You do miracles
[42:10] so great.
[42:13] There is no one else.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah Lord. None like you.
[42:20] There is no
[42:25] for you are great.
[42:28] You do miracle so great.
[42:33] There is no one else like you.
[42:40] There is no one else
[42:46] &gt;&gt; like you.
[42:48] Let's go before him, Lord Jesus. We
[42:52] certainly declare there's none like you,
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Lord. And it'll take an eternity just to
[42:59] begin to know you.
[43:02] And how we thank you, Lord, for looking
[43:04] out over our lives and bringing us to
[43:06] this moment in time tonight.
[43:09] Lord, I believe we stand in a
[43:11] predestinated moment that you have
[43:14] ordained that we would be gathered
[43:15] together. You would come by our way,
[43:18] Lord, and speak words of life. For you
[43:21] said the words that I speak unto you,
[43:23] they are spirit, they are life. So we
[43:25] not do not look to a man this evening,
[43:28] but we look to your divine promise that
[43:30] you are gathered here with us, Lord, and
[43:32] that you could come and just move us
[43:34] aside, Lord, and anoint the the speaker
[43:37] and the hearer. that you could just have
[43:39] your perfect will and way. Lord, we
[43:41] would bind the enemy in the name of
[43:43] Jesus Christ that would try to hinder
[43:45] the moving of your Holy Spirit and the
[43:47] revelation that you would want to bring
[43:49] to your believing children this evening.
[43:51] Lord, we know that he's like a roaring
[43:54] lion seeking and whom he would de
[43:56] devour. But he is defeated for you
[43:58] defeated him on Calvary, Lord. And our
[44:01] faith is looking to your word, to the
[44:03] divine promises that you have given to
[44:05] us. And by that faith, Lord, we can
[44:07] quench every fiery dart of the enemy. We
[44:10] are not a powerless church, but we are
[44:13] the very empowered bride of Jesus Christ
[44:15] by thine own spirit in the last days,
[44:18] Lord. So, we're thankful to be standing
[44:20] in this moment. And I look with great
[44:22] expectation for what you would have for
[44:24] your people tonight. We ask these
[44:26] blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:27] Christ. Amen. Amen. And if you have your
[44:30] Bibles, let's just turn to Psalms 27
[44:34] or uh
[44:38] um let's turn to 1 Corinthians 15.
[44:42] We'll just see how the Lord will lead.
[44:45] Uh praise God.
[44:49] 1 Corinthians
[44:53] 15
[44:56] and 51.
[45:02] How's everybody feeling this evening?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:07] Satan tried to stop you, but he
[45:09] couldn't.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:12] Some of y'all didn't want to come back
[45:14] tonight.
[45:16] Your bed was feeling too good and
[45:19] I'll just stream. But something else
[45:21] said, "You know what?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; You old bag of bones. I'm going to
[45:25] church."
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you made it anyhow.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[45:32] 51 would read, "Behold, I show you a
[45:35] mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we
[45:39] shall all be changed."
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Well, that's that's shouting grounds
[45:46] right there. Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye,
[45:50] at the last trump, for the trump it
[45:52] shall sound, and the dead shall be
[45:55] raised incorruptible, and we shall be
[45:57] changed. For this corruptible must put
[46:00] on incorruption, and this mortal must
[46:02] put on immortality.
[46:04] So when this corruptible shall have put
[46:06] on incorruption, and this mortal shall
[46:09] have put on immortality, then shall be
[46:11] brought to pass the saying that is
[46:13] written, "Death is swallowed up in
[46:16] victory." Oh death, where is thy sting?
[46:20] Oh grave, where is thy victory?
[46:24] The sting of death is sin, and the
[46:28] strength of sin is the law.
[46:31] But
[46:32] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[46:36] victory
[46:37] through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We
[46:41] pray a blessing on the reading of the
[46:43] word. You may be seated.
[46:47] Amen.
[46:48] Hallelujah.
[46:50] Well, I'm just I'm just waiting for
[46:52] launching power. So,
[46:54] &gt;&gt; you know, uh I really appreciated the
[46:57] words that we heard
[46:59] &gt;&gt; uh this morning. You know, there ought
[47:01] to be a a church standing um on the face
[47:04] of this earth with the message that we
[47:07] have received where uh it's that there's
[47:10] a works and a life that is following the
[47:13] word that we've heard. Amen. And Romans
[47:17] 8:11 would say, "But if the spirit of
[47:19] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[47:21] dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
[47:24] from the dead shall also quicken your
[47:26] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[47:28] dwelleth in you." And I I just like this
[47:31] quote and we actually read this last
[47:32] time we ministered and thought we would
[47:34] just maybe find some launching ground
[47:36] from here in Easter Seal uh paragraph
[47:38] 109. He said, "And when we believe on
[47:41] Jesus Christ for our savior and repent
[47:43] and are baptized and come up to believe
[47:46] him, God recognizes our repentance and
[47:48] our faith toward him."
[47:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; And sends down the abstract. And the
[47:56] abstract is the assurance.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; It's the guarantee that everything that
[48:01] was ever held against you, you
[48:03] thoroughly repented. Hallelujah. and the
[48:06] property is boughten and you hold the
[48:08] abstract for the assurance. Let somebody
[48:11] try to put you off the land, say he
[48:13] belongs and and with the abstract in
[48:15] your hand, let them try to do it. There
[48:17] ain't no law in the land can do it
[48:19] because you hold the abstract.
[48:21] Hallelujah. Do you have an abstract
[48:23] tonight? Something that says I got it
[48:26] right. And there's no devil, no church
[48:28] or any theology that can overstep the
[48:32] boundaries of God's proof and abstract
[48:34] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[48:36] recognized us in Jesus Christ. We're
[48:39] just as sure to raise as he raised
[48:41] because potentially we have already
[48:44] raised in him. Amen. The old things,
[48:46] what does it do to our mortal bodies? It
[48:48] turns our opinions, changes our notions.
[48:50] It sets our affections on things which
[48:53] are above and and the smoking and the
[48:55] drinking and the gambling and the things
[48:57] you used to do is dead and it's beneath
[48:59] you and you are quickened and the
[49:01] quickening power brings your body into a
[49:03] raptured condition already. Oh, I just
[49:06] love that so much. I I believe that is a
[49:08] promise and a quote right there that you
[49:11] can whoop the devil with because the
[49:12] quickening power brings your body into a
[49:15] raptured condition already. I'm so glad
[49:18] that the quickening power changes the
[49:20] way you act. It changes the way you
[49:21] talk. It it changes your ideas and your
[49:24] opinions and the and the things you
[49:25] wanted to do and the things you used to
[49:27] do. And and sometimes we we need to just
[49:29] look to that quickening power into the
[49:31] word of God because many times the old
[49:33] flesh man wants to try to reassert
[49:35] itself and try to discourage you and
[49:37] pull you one way to the other, one way
[49:39] to the next and say, "Hey, I'm not going
[49:41] to go to church tonight. I'm just going
[49:42] to I'm just going to sit back and stream
[49:44] a little bit." You know, but I like it
[49:45] when you say, "You know what? I'd rather
[49:47] be found in the house of God on a Sunday
[49:49] night. I I'd rather be obedient to the
[49:51] word and to the prophet when he says if
[49:53] the doors are open, there's something in
[49:55] your heart that wants to be there. I'm
[49:56] so glad that there's a quickening power
[49:58] that can bring your body under
[50:00] subjection to the power of almighty God
[50:02] and to the power of the word that we're
[50:04] not just left to man's opinions and
[50:06] man's uh efforts and ideas that will
[50:08] always fail. I mean, how many times have
[50:10] we started out to achieve something and
[50:12] you thought you'd be a better Christian
[50:14] and I'm going to get the overcoming
[50:15] power and I won't do this anymore and
[50:17] and and I'll set a pattern of good
[50:19] works. You know, if it ain't for the
[50:20] quickening power of God, you'll find
[50:21] yourself falling to the same snares and
[50:24] to the same traps and you'll think, I I
[50:26] finally got this under control and and
[50:28] and I got I finally got what I what I've
[50:31] been looking for. And you'll find
[50:32] yourself coming to a condition or a
[50:34] situation and you'll fall to that same
[50:36] thing again. that that shouldn't
[50:37] discourage you, but let it encourage you
[50:39] that there is more quickening power for
[50:41] the believer that you can be so
[50:43] surrendered to that you can have
[50:45] overcoming power in every situation. I
[50:48] don't care where you're from, in your
[50:49] private life, in your work, in your car,
[50:51] at your home, with your family, in your
[50:52] job, in the church, in the church
[50:54] parking lot. Sometimes we need more
[50:56] overcoming power right outside here in
[50:58] front of the church, you know, cuz it's
[50:59] those that you love that can hurt you
[51:01] the most and and those of your own
[51:02] household that can get under your skin.
[51:04] But you got to find some real love and
[51:05] faith to to go along with it and pray
[51:07] and be long-suffering. Amen. We need
[51:10] quickening power to quicken our mind and
[51:12] and our thoughts and our actions, you
[51:14] know, to quicken the way that we think
[51:15] and and to quicken us in how we handle
[51:17] our time. Redeeming the time. Amen. Hey,
[51:20] I say it takes some quickening power to
[51:22] redeem the time as we see the day
[51:24] approaching. So many of us are given
[51:25] over to so many things that don't do
[51:27] anything to further the kingdom of God.
[51:29] We just feed the flesh. We just uh
[51:31] listen to all these other nonsense and
[51:33] things and we're not giving over to
[51:34] prayer. We're not giving into praying
[51:35] for revelation. We're not studying the
[51:37] word. We're not looking into the
[51:38] message. I don't know you, but the the
[51:40] bride of Christ should be feeding every
[51:42] day on this word. You ought to be
[51:44] listening to the prophet every day. You
[51:45] ought to be reading your Bible. You
[51:47] ought to be praying. I want to tell you,
[51:48] there ain't nothing else to live for.
[51:50] I've lived for the world. It ain't worth
[51:51] living for. I've lived to to pay the
[51:53] bills. I've lived to do those things and
[51:55] all those things are going to burn.
[51:56] They're all going to perish away. I I
[51:58] don't care. You can get all enthused
[51:59] about something. But I tell you, it's
[52:01] all going to burn. But there's one
[52:02] thing. If you can ever get excited about
[52:04] the word of God and start catching a
[52:06] revelation of what this message really
[52:08] is, I want to tell you, it's worth
[52:09] living for. It's worth dying for. It's
[52:11] worth giving all your time and
[52:13] attention. It's worth pouring yourself
[52:15] into it, lifting it up, studying it out,
[52:18] and getting a revelation.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's where the quickening power
[52:23] is. It lays within this word. It's a
[52:25] real quickening power. It's a real life,
[52:28] you know, and and I I just something
[52:30] that's been on my heart in in the
[52:32] rapture. Brother Brandham says, "Faith
[52:33] is something that's been revealed to you
[52:35] like it was to Abraham that could call
[52:38] anything contrary to what had been
[52:40] revealed to him as though it wasn't." So
[52:42] look, faith puts you into action. And
[52:46] faith also has a voice. If anything's
[52:49] contrary to the word, it calls it as
[52:51] though it is not. Look, look, faith has
[52:53] a voice. Are you Are you hearing me
[52:55] tonight? Faith has a voice that can
[52:58] actually speak the word and call things
[53:00] that are not as though they are. Look,
[53:02] you might sound like a fanatic. You
[53:04] might sound like a crazy man. And
[53:06] absolutely Abraham sounded like a crazy
[53:08] man because all of the things of your
[53:10] senses and reasoning and touch, taste,
[53:12] see, and felt, all of those things
[53:14] declared to Abraham, to his neighbors,
[53:16] to the doctors, to his wife, to his
[53:18] brothers, to his sisters. There's no way
[53:20] that you're going to have a baby. But
[53:22] something had been revealed to Abraham.
[53:25] Oh, he faith was a revelation that
[53:27] declared another reality. Faith declares
[53:31] another reality than the very one that
[53:33] you're seeing with your own eyeballs.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; If it's contrary to the word, it's not.
[53:41] So,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Satan, you're a liar.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; God gave me the promise.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; And it says it calls those things that
[53:51] are not Hey, sometimes you got to start
[53:52] calling it what it is.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] The promise has a voice.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to start speaking
[54:05] the word.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to believe. It's like,
[54:08] you know, some of us just need to take
[54:10] take the promise that you received and
[54:12] go into action and start speaking it.
[54:14] Start talking about it. Start meditating
[54:16] on it. Start praying about it. Start
[54:18] telling your neighbors about it. Start
[54:19] telling your family about it. Hey, I'm
[54:21] going to have a Well, you say you
[54:22] believe. Well, get excited about it. If
[54:24] you believe it, declare it.
[54:27] Faith put you into action. Amen. You
[54:31] know, as we heard this morning, what
[54:32] kind of Christian should we be? Show me
[54:35] your faith.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; You can claim to be something. And I
[54:40] want to say there's been a lot of claims
[54:41] made. A lot of people make a lot of
[54:43] claims. They, you know, a lot of people
[54:45] have claimed the world's going to end at
[54:46] this time and the world's going to end
[54:48] that time. What does it do? The date
[54:49] comes and it goes. There's been a lot of
[54:52] men raise up and try to be some great
[54:54] eighth messenger, you know, and what do
[54:55] they do? They crash and burn and they
[54:57] hit the ditch and and many if the Lord
[55:00] carries many more will rise up. We let
[55:01] they'll all crash and burn. Many men
[55:03] make claims.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Many men have claimed to be some some
[55:10] big messenger or some big thing. But you
[55:12] know what? If it's contrary to the word,
[55:15] I say leave it alone. Faith has works.
[55:18] Abra, brother Random said Abraham's
[55:20] works was expressing his faith he had in
[55:23] God's promise. What was he doing? He was
[55:26] getting ready. He was testifying. And we
[55:29] are of the faith of Abraham.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; We call anything contrary to the word as
[55:34] though it was.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; So what the promise is our reality.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Look, this ain't just uh talk.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; I've heard a lot of people run their
[55:47] mouth
[55:49] and they're all talk. You know, they got
[55:51] some worldly expression that says, "Put
[55:53] your money where your mouth is."
[55:55] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people run their
[55:57] mouth and they talk a big game, but when
[55:58] when it comes to show what you really
[56:00] believe, they show their colors.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; There there's been a lot of people run
[56:04] their mouth, you know. I I mean, there
[56:06] there's been a lot of people that would
[56:07] run their mouth about the prophet, about
[56:09] the message,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; you know, but when it came down to a
[56:12] showdown,
[56:14] well, where were they? They they knew
[56:16] that that that the prophet had something
[56:18] more than they had.
[56:20] And I have something to say about this
[56:22] little movement that sparked up in the
[56:23] last 10 or 15 years, you know, starting
[56:26] to uh uh uh this this nonsense. I don't
[56:28] even want to name it because they
[56:29] shouldn't invoke much of our time. But I
[56:31] tell you what, what a bunch of cowards
[56:33] want to try to wait so many years and
[56:35] and so many witness. I tell you what, if
[56:37] you'd opened your mouth 20, 30 years
[56:38] ago, you had a litany of witness that
[56:40] said, "I was there. I was in the
[56:42] meeting. He called my name. He told me
[56:44] about my wife. He told me about my
[56:46] condition." You want to try to call him
[56:48] a fake. You want to try to tell him he's
[56:49] a false prophet when he discerned the
[56:51] very thoughts and intents of my heart.
[56:53] Oh, there would have been thousands of
[56:54] voices that would have been coming say,
[56:55] "Hey, you that you want to try to
[56:57] stand." But what do they do? They wait
[56:59] until there's just maybe, oh, maybe
[57:01] three or four left,
[57:03] &gt;&gt; bunch of cowards,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; but you know, I shouldn't get, you know,
[57:07] I don't want to get too much into that
[57:08] because, you know, it's harvest time.
[57:09] It's manifesting time. Look, everybody
[57:11] got to be what God made them or what
[57:13] what seed they are. So, you know, let
[57:15] let the unbeliever be an unbeliever. Let
[57:17] the makeel believer be a be a be a
[57:19] makebeliever. But I say, why don't we
[57:20] let the bride be the bride? Why why
[57:23] don't you be what God made you? I I
[57:24] think you ain't you ain't you ain't
[57:26] beholden to nobody. You ain't got to
[57:28] impress nobody. You ain't you ain't here
[57:30] to prove nothing to nobody else but just
[57:32] prove your love to the Lord Jesus
[57:34] Christ. And recognize that he called me
[57:36] and he wrote my name on the lamb's book
[57:38] of life before the foundation of the
[57:40] world. And I am going in a rapture and
[57:42] I'm going to follow this message with
[57:43] all of my heart. I'm going to pray and
[57:45] I'm going to continue to serve him with
[57:47] everything I have. Look, you we what
[57:49] what do we ain't trying to to to to
[57:51] prove something to everybody else that
[57:53] we got something more than them.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; That just causes carnal impersonations
[57:57] and workups and buildups and things that
[57:59] just crash and burn.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; But when you got a secret life and a
[58:03] hidden life,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; when you're in Psalms 27, you're in the
[58:07] secret place. Come on, y'all help me
[58:09] preach tonight. I don't I mean, hey,
[58:10] y'all, it's up to y'all if we're going
[58:12] to preach or not. So, why don't we just
[58:13] have church? We're here, right?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; We can be short or long. The the the
[58:20] harder you pull, the shorter we'll be.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; But, you know, I I I've heard people run
[58:26] their mouth, but you know, uh uh this
[58:29] this there's a lot of people that say
[58:31] they're Christians and they say they're
[58:32] believers, but their life declares
[58:34] something completely different. They
[58:36] they have no ability to meet the
[58:38] challenge of the age. They have they
[58:40] have no ability to live an overcoming
[58:42] life. that I ain't talking about being
[58:44] able to abstain from certain things, but
[58:46] I'm talking about being able to meet the
[58:47] challenge of the age. And I want to say
[58:49] the challenge of the age is rapture. The
[58:51] challenge of the age is to believe every
[58:53] word that was spoken by Malachi 4:5.
[58:56] Many people can come up so far. Many
[58:58] people could say amen to justification,
[59:00] sanctification, the restoration of the
[59:02] gifts. Many people can say amen to
[59:04] Malachi 4:5 and God sent a prophet. But
[59:06] just as Jesus said, unless you eat my
[59:08] flesh and drink my blood, you'll have no
[59:10] life. tell you, you have no part of me.
[59:12] I tell you, there is a bride that will
[59:14] say amen to every word that was spoken
[59:17] by Malachi 4:5. I will not back up. I
[59:21] will not compromise. I will not give it
[59:23] over to say it was just an opinion or I
[59:26] can take a little here and take a little
[59:27] there. Look, every word I say, hey,
[59:30] hallelujah. I believe it all.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; And as you receive the word, you become
[59:36] the word. Amen.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I I just was thinking about that.
[59:40] How he would stand there hh night night
[59:43] after night after night and prove that
[59:45] Jesus Christ was the same yesterday,
[59:47] today, and forever. Opening blind eyes.
[59:50] People being raised off of CS and
[59:51] stretchers, discerning the thoughts and
[59:53] intents of the heart. Oh, that many
[59:55] people come and they enjoyed those
[59:57] things. And when he brought the word,
[59:58] even men would testify over out of their
[1:00:01] own mouths like, "Well, he got off at
[1:00:02] the end. He got off the word." No, they
[1:00:04] just got off from following a vindicated
[1:00:06] prophet. And he would stand there and
[1:00:08] declare just as Jesus said, "Search the
[1:00:10] scriptures. In them you think you have
[1:00:12] eternal life, and they are they that
[1:00:14] testify of me."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; I say you know them by their fruits.
[1:00:19] Jesus said in Matthew 7:19, "Every tree
[1:00:21] that bringeth forth not good fruits is
[1:00:23] heuned down and cast into the fire."
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Wherefore, by their fruits you shall
[1:00:29] know them.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; I say we ought to possess some love.
[1:00:36] Right? We ought to have some faith.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; We should have some works.
[1:00:42] I'm afraid some of us relegate our works
[1:00:44] to just Wednesday and Sunday,
[1:00:48] you know? I mean, hey, I'm I'm a good
[1:00:50] Christian on Sunday
[1:00:52] and uh I I go to church on Wednesday,
[1:00:54] but what about your everyday life? What
[1:00:56] kingdom are you living for?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you living for yourself?
[1:01:04] That that that that's that's a good
[1:01:06] place to start right there. A lot of us
[1:01:07] are just living for ourselves.
[1:01:11] A lot of us are just selfish, you know,
[1:01:14] trying to pay the bills, you know,
[1:01:15] trying trying to trying to make a
[1:01:16] living. But where's that leadership?
[1:01:18] Where where's that hunger for
[1:01:20] revelation? Where's that Lord? What
[1:01:22] would you have me to do? Lord, is there
[1:01:23] something in the church? Is there
[1:01:25] somebody I can pray for? Is there a
[1:01:27] burden that I can carry? Not something
[1:01:29] some big uh uh to-d do where everybody
[1:01:31] can say, "Oh, look at me." But something
[1:01:33] maybe in humility and meekness and a
[1:01:35] total surrender. Lord, is there
[1:01:37] something that I can do for your
[1:01:38] kingdom? He says, "And not everyone that
[1:01:40] saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
[1:01:42] into the kingdom of heaven, but he that
[1:01:44] doeth the will of my father which is in
[1:01:47] heaven." Oh, I love that. Just as we
[1:01:48] heard this morning, you know, where
[1:01:50] there is no vision, the people perish.
[1:01:52] I'm so glad that the bride has received
[1:01:54] a revelation from a vindicated prophet
[1:01:57] which is your vision which reveals to
[1:01:59] you the will of God for your life. I
[1:02:01] look I am not sitting around here and
[1:02:03] wondering what the will of God is for my
[1:02:05] life. Now, sometimes I know you come to
[1:02:07] to crossroads and certain things and you
[1:02:09] you might be wondering, well, should I
[1:02:11] live here or or should I go there or or
[1:02:13] should I go to that church, you know,
[1:02:15] and and maybe you come to those
[1:02:17] decisions, but and that's all right. We
[1:02:19] have to come to those places and learn
[1:02:21] to grow and follow the leadership of the
[1:02:22] Lord. And sometimes we just need to
[1:02:24] learn how to sit and and stand still.
[1:02:26] And I I say that's where a lot of us get
[1:02:28] ourselves in trouble is we don't really
[1:02:29] know how to just sit and be still. You
[1:02:31] know, if God led you and and God's
[1:02:32] placed you, well, then uh be, you know,
[1:02:34] you're content in that state until he
[1:02:36] continues to lead you. You know, there
[1:02:37] so many times we're we're looking for
[1:02:39] some other answer. We're looking for
[1:02:40] some other way when when I tell you
[1:02:42] what, if you just be faithful with what
[1:02:43] was given you, God would continue to
[1:02:45] lead and guide you into all truth and
[1:02:46] righteousness. And sometimes we haven't
[1:02:48] even been faithful with what God's given
[1:02:50] us. And we're looking for something
[1:02:51] bigger and better. And it's like, you
[1:02:53] haven't even been faithful with what
[1:02:54] I've given you. You want a bigger house
[1:02:55] and a bigger car. You can't even keep
[1:02:57] what you got. You can't even be thankful
[1:02:58] for what you got. I mean, I tell you
[1:03:00] what, we ought to be so thankful for the
[1:03:02] very things that God has given us. I I
[1:03:04] would say if anybody on the face of this
[1:03:06] earth should be thankful. It should be
[1:03:08] the bride of Christ. We should be so
[1:03:09] thankful for our church. We'd be so so
[1:03:12] thankful for our brothers and sisters, I
[1:03:14] say there ought to be an outpouring of
[1:03:15] thanksgiving in our heart for the
[1:03:17] message of the hour and the things that
[1:03:19] you ought to be so thankful.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Hey, there's a lot of people that are
[1:03:25] way better than me and do a lot more
[1:03:27] works than I could ever do.
[1:03:30] So, you can't compete with some of the
[1:03:32] the lives given to to to to to uh uh the
[1:03:36] works out in the bushes and things like
[1:03:38] that. And and some of them on that day
[1:03:41] say, Lord, have I not done all these
[1:03:43] things?
[1:03:45] And what will he declare unto him?
[1:03:47] Depart from me, you workers of iniquity,
[1:03:50] for I never knew you. Oh, but to think
[1:03:52] that God knew you so much that he wrote
[1:03:54] your name on the Lamb's book of life
[1:03:56] before the foundation of the world. and
[1:03:58] he came calling your name and pulled you
[1:04:00] up out of the muck and mire. I say there
[1:04:02] ought to be a thanksgiving out
[1:04:04] outpouring out of your heart,
[1:04:06] a love and thanksgiving to God every
[1:04:09] single day. There ought to be praises
[1:04:11] and a thanksgiving going up to God.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Why do I got to go to church? Why do I,
[1:04:19] you know, why? Why is this happening to
[1:04:21] me? Quit your whining.
[1:04:24] Quit your complaining.
[1:04:28] Should I say it again?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're talking about
[1:04:33] revelation.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Revelation changes everything.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I say it changes everything.
[1:04:42] When you start to catch a revelation
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; that we are going in a rapture,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; when we start catching a revelation that
[1:04:51] he is Jehovah
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Gyra,
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; he is my provider. That the word he he's
[1:04:58] able to provide for himself. Look, as
[1:05:01] long as I take him at his word and I
[1:05:03] stay with that word, if he gave the
[1:05:06] promise, God is able to provide for
[1:05:08] himself.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:12] Many will say on that day, Lord, Lord,
[1:05:14] have we not prophesied in thy name? In
[1:05:16] thy name cast out devils, and in my name
[1:05:17] have we not done many wonderful works,
[1:05:19] and then will I profess unto them, I
[1:05:21] never knew you. Depart from you that
[1:05:22] work iniquity. I like how we heard this
[1:05:25] this morning in in in the tape. Brother
[1:05:27] Brandham said, "The word measures them
[1:05:29] up." They can't cross every single word
[1:05:32] of it. You know, they're always going to
[1:05:34] come to some portion to where they say,
[1:05:35] "Well, I don't know about it." And you
[1:05:37] still see that today with the people the
[1:05:40] way they might live their life or the or
[1:05:42] the little things that they hold on to.
[1:05:44] They're declaring.
[1:05:45] You know, I I believe all of it. But
[1:05:49] you sometimes you get to know somebody,
[1:05:51] you might wonder and you come up to
[1:05:52] something and you find out like, "Oh my,
[1:05:54] they don't believe that."
[1:05:56] Like my I I thought they were a
[1:05:57] believer. Oh, hold on. Don't don't. But
[1:06:00] sometimes, you know, when God reveals
[1:06:02] something to you and you see it so plain
[1:06:04] in the word of God and you come up and
[1:06:06] somebody just totally rejects that in
[1:06:08] your heart, it vexes your spirit say,
[1:06:10] "Oh God, may you help them open their
[1:06:11] eyes. They they can't see that laying
[1:06:14] right there." And yet their life is
[1:06:16] declaring, "Yeah, I believe I believe
[1:06:17] 95% of it. I believe 99% of Oh, but
[1:06:21] there is a bride that believes 100% in
[1:06:25] all the word." And they don't just
[1:06:27] believe it, they will manifest it. Amen.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; This This ain't a hope so gospel. This
[1:06:33] ain't a fairy tale gospel. This ain't
[1:06:35] some h a pie in the sky.
[1:06:38] Well, you know, we can close here soon.
[1:06:42] Let's find a way find a place to close.
[1:06:45] My sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:06:47] me.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people heard the
[1:06:51] word.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; A lot of people started with the word.
[1:06:56] My Bible tells me it's he who endures to
[1:06:59] the end.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; I don't want to tell you. You think it's
[1:07:02] hard now, just stick around a little
[1:07:03] while.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; I I I I ain't going to tell you this
[1:07:06] ain't going to get any easier.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; And and it has to get harder. It has to
[1:07:11] get worse. And you better know that you
[1:07:12] know that you know.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz sometimes you come into hard trials
[1:07:16] and hard situations and you realize, you
[1:07:18] know, I really didn't have what I
[1:07:20] thought I had. But I say, let it be the
[1:07:21] grace of God letting you know, son, you
[1:07:23] really don't got what you thought you
[1:07:25] had. You you tried to work it up. You
[1:07:27] tried to make it happen. And then you
[1:07:29] fell back down. But oh son, I've given
[1:07:31] you a promise regardless of your faults
[1:07:33] and regardless of your failures. There
[1:07:35] is a quickening power that can bring the
[1:07:37] promise into manifestation.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Not just put it off in something in the
[1:07:41] future.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people are just
[1:07:44] waiting for an event.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; They're just they're just waiting for
[1:07:50] some squeeze to come. that they're
[1:07:53] waiting for some ecumenical force or oh
[1:07:56] you know hey I got a quote for it
[1:07:58] brother Random said look look a national
[1:08:00] force put Israel in the homeland but he
[1:08:02] said it'll be the power of God that puts
[1:08:04] the bride
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; right
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; it's not some outside force but what is
[1:08:10] it revelation the rapture is a
[1:08:12] revelation
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; oh it changes you quickens you
[1:08:20] my sheep hear my voice and Hey,
[1:08:25] y'all know that scripture.
[1:08:27] My sheep hear my voice and they
[1:08:31] All right. If y'all haven't heard that
[1:08:33] scripture before, it goes, "My sheep
[1:08:35] hear my voice and they follow me."
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:08:43] me.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; A lot of people here,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; but now I'm talking about following
[1:08:51] Are you following the pillar of fire?
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Are you following the message of the
[1:08:56] hour? Brother Brandham says in
[1:08:58] perseverance and the whole armor of God
[1:09:00] is faith, love, joy, peace,
[1:09:02] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:09:03] gentleness, patience. The whole armor of
[1:09:06] the believers is faith. We believe God
[1:09:08] by faith because God said so then what
[1:09:10] is it? Abraham was justified by Paul by
[1:09:14] faith, but by James by works. Abraham
[1:09:17] was talking what God saw and James was
[1:09:19] talking what man saw.
[1:09:23] Show me your faiths by your works
[1:09:25] without your works and so forth. See,
[1:09:27] then if you don't have works with your
[1:09:29] faith, it shows you haven't got faith.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; You're just talking from your mouth.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Hey, I've been guilty of it. I've done a
[1:09:40] lot of talking with my mouth.
[1:09:45] I I I've talked the quotes and and I
[1:09:48] thought I kind of knew a little
[1:09:49] something. You get to talking to
[1:09:50] somebody a little bit about it and ask a
[1:09:51] little question. All a sudden you I
[1:09:52] really don't know what I'm talking
[1:09:53] about.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But you know there's some type of
[1:09:57] pressure like we got to be know-it-
[1:09:59] alls. I got to have a I got to have an
[1:10:02] answer for everything. Brother Brandham
[1:10:03] said you find a man that got the answer
[1:10:04] to everything. Watch out for that guy.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, I don't care
[1:10:09] what it is. It could be some fundamental
[1:10:11] doctrine and somebody asked you the
[1:10:12] question like, you know, I really don't
[1:10:13] know. I believe it, but I'd like to know
[1:10:14] more.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; I'd have a lot of respect for that. I've
[1:10:17] asked some people some questions and
[1:10:18] things. They like, well, doesn't mean
[1:10:20] this, this, and this, and this, or that.
[1:10:21] I'm like, you know what? No. Well, you
[1:10:23] know, let's see what the prophet said
[1:10:26] about it.
[1:10:27] I like that we don't have works with
[1:10:30] your faith. It shows you haven't got
[1:10:31] faith. You're just talking from your
[1:10:33] mouth. But if you really got faith, you
[1:10:36] believe it and act like it.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; It puts you in action.
[1:10:43] Look friends, we have an absolute.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you, we have an absolute.
[1:10:48] Anything contrary to it.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Look, we we have an absolute. You know
[1:10:53] what an absolute is? I mean, it's
[1:10:55] absolute. I don't know how else to say
[1:10:57] it. It's an absolute.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; When you have an absolute, and I want to
[1:11:01] tell you that this message, I can't even
[1:11:02] believe it. It struck me funny. I I
[1:11:04] don't did you know there's actually in
[1:11:06] some some circles that there's some
[1:11:08] debate or some there has to be a
[1:11:10] conversation about the me they they
[1:11:13] don't want to accept the message as
[1:11:14] their absolute.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; It's just because they don't have a
[1:11:18] revelation of what it is.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Like if you got to like do a walk around
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; like where hey the message is my
[1:11:26] absolute. Well, you know
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; what what are you what are you trying to
[1:11:29] say?
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Like are you kidding me?
[1:11:33] What? I'm not trying to say anything.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't got a thought coming. I'm just
[1:11:38] trying to, you know,
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; there was a deep call into a deep and a
[1:11:42] deep respond to it. It changed my life.
[1:11:44] It It pulled me up out of the muck of my
[1:11:46] I was going one direction and the
[1:11:48] quickening power come and snatched me
[1:11:50] from death under life. And now I'm
[1:11:52] following the pillar of fire and I'm
[1:11:54] following into my health. I'm following
[1:11:56] into my body change. I'm bringing my
[1:11:58] family into it, those that are around me
[1:12:00] into it. I'm walking in truth. I'm
[1:12:02] walking in righteous. I'm going in a
[1:12:04] rapture. I'm marching onward Christian
[1:12:07] soldier because I have an absolute and
[1:12:09] it's thus sayeth the Lord. Heavens and
[1:12:11] earth will pass away. But this absolute
[1:12:14] of Jesus Christ, the revelation of the
[1:12:16] age will never pass away. I'm talking
[1:12:19] about an absolute.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; It cannot be defeated.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; There ain't no demon. There ain't no no
[1:12:27] devil. There ain't no theology. There
[1:12:29] ain't no church. There ain't no man. I'm
[1:12:32] talking about an absolute. I'm talking
[1:12:34] about a King of Kings. I'm talking about
[1:12:36] the Lord of Lords. He's the Lord of
[1:12:38] glory. Who is the Lord mighty and bad?
[1:12:42] That's my absolute
[1:12:45] sir.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Well, you know, are you talking about a
[1:12:51] man?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:12:58] Have you not been reading and listening,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; theologians?
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Well, my absolute the Bible,
[1:13:06] friend,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; you don't even know what that says.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, you might as well call me a fanatic
[1:13:14] right now. You don't even know the truth
[1:13:17] of this Bible until you recognize a
[1:13:21] vindicated prophet. Thus say the Lord
[1:13:23] that took a closed book
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; that we were probing at and wondering
[1:13:28] where I came from, where am I going,
[1:13:30] what are the truth, what's laying under
[1:13:32] those seals. But then the mighty angel
[1:13:34] come down veiling himself in the form of
[1:13:37] a man opening the seven seals and the
[1:13:40] voice of God thundering out. Amen.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's an absolute.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; They just don't even know what they're
[1:13:58] talking about.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; See, that's the problem.
[1:14:04] Everybody thought they were following a
[1:14:05] man named Moses
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; cuz they can see the flesh.
[1:14:12] You might be able to see this flesh,
[1:14:14] too.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; They can see the humanity. Oh, I want to
[1:14:18] preach a sermon called the humanity and
[1:14:21] the vision.
[1:14:24] Because God can speak a vision. And thus
[1:14:28] sayeth the Lord can be thundering out.
[1:14:30] But you know what's all wrapped up in
[1:14:32] the vision? A lot of humanity,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; a lot of flesh,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; and what you know what? Bless Aaron and
[1:14:42] Miam.
[1:14:45] Cuz their brother was thus sayeth the
[1:14:48] Lord.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I have come down.
[1:14:54] And how did he come down? Going in the
[1:14:57] form of a man.
[1:15:00] And Moses had become so common.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And how could Moses not be common to
[1:15:06] Aaron and Mary
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; where it got so close they forgot?
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; You know, we could go into it where
[1:15:17] where I it's failing me now, but you
[1:15:20] know, they they got to thinking they had
[1:15:22] something to do with it,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; you know. You know, I mean, hey, we got
[1:15:26] a lot we we We got something to say here
[1:15:29] too.
[1:15:31] You know what happened? Pill of fire
[1:15:34] dropped out of the sky said, "Aaron and
[1:15:36] Mo Mariam, come here." Um, you know,
[1:15:40] uh, yeah, there there's a gift of of
[1:15:43] prophecy,
[1:15:45] you know, where my spirit will move upon
[1:15:47] somebody and they'll prophet, but your
[1:15:48] brother, my servant Moses, that ain't it
[1:15:51] ain't that kind of prophet.
[1:15:55] No, he's the kind of prophet that I
[1:15:58] speak lip to ear.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; So then the words that coming out of the
[1:16:06] vessel
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; is thus saith the Lord.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But there's so much humanity in it. They
[1:16:14] just thought they following some man.
[1:16:16] And everybody starts to complain, hey
[1:16:17] Moses, have you brought us out here to
[1:16:19] die? You know, is that why you brought
[1:16:22] us out here? and and they're totally
[1:16:24] blind. Somehow I just, you know,
[1:16:25] everybody gots to play their part
[1:16:27] because in all of that there was two
[1:16:28] predestinated seeds. But in all of that,
[1:16:31] can you imagine seeing all the signs and
[1:16:33] all the wonders a and miracle after
[1:16:36] miracle after miracle performed? And you
[1:16:39] would think uh you would think by signs
[1:16:41] and think about the church world, right?
[1:16:43] Here come God veiling himself in a man
[1:16:45] proving that he's the same yesterday,
[1:16:47] today, and forever. Taking a people in
[1:16:49] an exodus, right? Look, we're coming out
[1:16:51] of the church ages. We're going into the
[1:16:53] bride age. We're going into rapture.
[1:16:55] Look, I am who I said I am. If you don't
[1:16:58] believe my words, believe the words.
[1:16:59] They testify of who I am.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Around the world, seven times
[1:17:05] vindicated, showing forth, discerning
[1:17:07] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[1:17:09] Just like Moses coming out, you would
[1:17:10] think they'd say, "Man, I tell you what,
[1:17:13] Egypt was the most mighty nation in all
[1:17:15] the world."
[1:17:17] But God is leading us out of here in our
[1:17:21] prophet Moses.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But how quickly did things get a little,
[1:17:26] you know, come to come to the Red Sea
[1:17:28] like, "Hey, Moses, did you bring us out
[1:17:29] here to die?"
[1:17:32] You know, he even got Moses in such a
[1:17:34] place that Moses started to to to cry
[1:17:36] about it. That's where brother Brandon
[1:17:37] preaches that whole message. Why cry?
[1:17:38] Speak.
[1:17:41] Moses was anointed for the job. He was
[1:17:43] gifted for the job. And God's telling
[1:17:44] Moses, "Look, Moses, what are you doing?
[1:17:46] Why are you crying? can go forward. Why?
[1:17:49] Because it was God veiling himself in a
[1:17:51] man. We don't have to wonder. We don't
[1:17:53] have to cry. I'm not wondering where I'm
[1:17:54] going. I'm not wondering if this message
[1:17:56] will fail or if it'll work. I have a
[1:17:58] revelation. Look, I I am not like Ananas
[1:18:01] and Safire. I don't got a backup plan.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; I I ain't sitting over here, you know,
[1:18:07] and and I'm I'm 90% message and 10%
[1:18:11] open.
[1:18:13] I'm not 99% this is thus sayith the Lord
[1:18:16] and 1% just in case it doesn't work.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I got no backup plan. I'm all in.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; All my eggs are in one basket. I'm going
[1:18:26] where this message takes me. And I'll be
[1:18:28] frank. I don't want to go anywhere it's
[1:18:30] not going.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; It's my ticket out of here.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; It's my salvation. It's my Holy Ghost.
[1:18:40] I'm talking about an absolute.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; We got an absolute.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; And everything else is absolutely dead.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Everything else is absolutely fake.
[1:18:55] Everything else is absolutely hybrid.
[1:18:58] Everything else is absolutely man-made.
[1:19:01] Everything else is absolutely going to
[1:19:03] be burned. Everything else is absolutely
[1:19:05] going to be left. But if this message is
[1:19:08] your absolute, you are absolutely going
[1:19:11] in a rapture. You will absolutely be
[1:19:14] healed. You will absolutely be changed.
[1:19:17] You are absolutely be victorious. You
[1:19:20] are absolutely receive every promise
[1:19:22] that God has given you. I'm talking
[1:19:25] about an absolute.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got an absolute.
[1:19:34] I had some absolutes in the world.
[1:19:37] And they absolutely failed me.
[1:19:40] They were absolutely a joke.
[1:19:44] Matter of fact, devil, you're a joke.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You are absolutely a joke. You ain't got
[1:19:49] nothing. And God gots it all.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Show me your faith.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; I mean,
[1:20:02] at least act like you believe the
[1:20:03] message.
[1:20:06] You know,
[1:20:08] at least I can give people, you know, I
[1:20:11] mean, some of these people,
[1:20:14] I mean, they're anointed by devils, but,
[1:20:16] you know,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; they ain't afraid to talk about it.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; There's people that will come out in
[1:20:21] public
[1:20:23] and declare to you that a man can have a
[1:20:26] baby.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And we ain't got enough guts to say,
[1:20:30] "God sent a prophet."
[1:20:33] Are you kidding me?
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; You heard me.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; We got people out there that'll go out
[1:20:41] and and and and
[1:20:44] workplaces create safe environments.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; I say they ought to they shouldn't be
[1:20:50] safe from you.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; You ought to be a walking talking Bible.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; You ought to be the Holy Ghost on two
[1:20:59] feet. They ought to know about it.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Hey, all I'm saying put God first.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, put
[1:21:10] I I forget I forget how he says it, but
[1:21:13] the prophet says he's mighty and
[1:21:15] healing. You got to see him in battle.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid of a fight.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You kidding me? I got a big brother.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; You know, one time I got me in a little
[1:21:25] squabble right down here at the Oaks
[1:21:27] Apartments right here. caddy corner
[1:21:29] right there, you know. And I remember
[1:21:32] the guy's name. He was bigger than me,
[1:21:33] you know, and and and I come up the
[1:21:35] stairs one time and and he said, "Come
[1:21:37] on up here." You know, I want to show
[1:21:38] you something. And I came up the stairs
[1:21:40] and and there was a rope in a circle. He
[1:21:41] goes, "You know, stand on over that
[1:21:43] circle." And I stood in the circle. And
[1:21:44] he pulled it tight and he dragged me
[1:21:45] down the stair. I'm talking about, "Hey,
[1:21:47] these weren't carpet stairs. These these
[1:21:49] old outdoor Hey, the stairs are still
[1:21:51] there. I'll take you over and show him."
[1:21:52] He dragged me straight down the whole
[1:21:53] thing down to the bottom.
[1:21:55] This guy was bigger than me and I was
[1:21:56] hurting and I was aching and I was in
[1:21:59] pain and he said, "What are you going to
[1:22:00] do about it?" And I thought, you know,
[1:22:03] I'mma go get my brother.
[1:22:07] So, you know what I did? I went back
[1:22:09] over to Mccur over there and I said,
[1:22:10] "Hey, hey, hey, man. This guy's picking
[1:22:12] on me." And you know what my brother
[1:22:14] did? He said, "All right, I'll go over
[1:22:17] there." My brother showed up. My My
[1:22:19] brother wasn't as big as I thought he
[1:22:21] was.
[1:22:25] This guy was bigger than me, bigger than
[1:22:28] him. But you know what my brother did?
[1:22:32] He fought for me.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I was his little brother.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; And you know what?
[1:22:40] That might mean my big brother in the
[1:22:42] flesh, but we got a bigger brother.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; You know, one thing I like about that
[1:22:47] story, my brother went to fighting. We
[1:22:49] kind of teamed up on that guy a little
[1:22:50] bit.
[1:22:53] But I tell you what, we got a big
[1:22:54] brother and his name is Jesus Christ.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be afraid of a fight.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be afraid of a battle.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; You got to be Are you kidding me? You
[1:23:04] You come to me with your armor and you
[1:23:06] come to me with your sword and you come
[1:23:08] to me declaring your Philistine gods.
[1:23:11] But I come unto you in the name of the
[1:23:13] Lord Jesus Christ. I will cut your head
[1:23:16] off, Goliath.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; What did David have? a revelation.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He was ascending to the throne and there
[1:23:26] wasn't no giant. There wasn't no devil.
[1:23:29] There was nothing that could stop the
[1:23:30] promised word of the prophet from coming
[1:23:32] to pass.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; He had an absolute.
[1:23:38] Well, come on.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; You got an absolute.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, give us revelation tonight.
[1:23:50] that could put us into action
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; that'll make us not afraid to declare
[1:23:55] this message.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you got friends
[1:23:59] that you associate with and you hang out
[1:24:02] with
[1:24:06] and you have not told them that God sent
[1:24:08] a prophet,
[1:24:10] I challenge you in the name of the Lord,
[1:24:16] let it out.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, I ain't trying to just
[1:24:19] tell you to, you know, you we want to
[1:24:21] use wisdom and discernment, and I'm not
[1:24:23] trying to I'm trying to encourage you in
[1:24:26] a way that if you love someone, ask the
[1:24:28] Lord to open the door. If you're not
[1:24:31] looking for the opport
[1:24:41] it's going to be gone
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; and there's going to come a day they'll
[1:24:45] look at you and say, "Why didn't you
[1:24:46] tell me?"
[1:24:49] I thought we were friends.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You said you loved me and you knew.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, help us.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord. I'm preaching to myself.
[1:25:06] Lord, help me. Let my faith go into
[1:25:09] action. Let me speak this message. Let
[1:25:12] me witness. Let me declare it.
[1:25:18] There there's power in revelation.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Well, you're not following that. See,
[1:25:24] they all they could see was the
[1:25:25] humanity. You're following a man.
[1:25:29] Far from it.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Far from it.
[1:25:33] But you know the whole thing
[1:25:36] like the answer, so close but so far
[1:25:38] away.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Because when God veils himself, what
[1:25:42] he's hidden in simplicity and that
[1:25:43] humility and that meekness. Oh, but when
[1:25:46] you can look past the veil and see none
[1:25:47] other, that is Jesus Christ, the same
[1:25:49] yesterday, today, and forever, and you
[1:25:51] say, you know what? I have an absolute.
[1:25:52] I have a vision. I'm not wondering where
[1:25:55] I'm going. I'm not wondering if I'm
[1:25:56] going to make may make it or I Why?
[1:25:59] Because I have an absolute. And look, in
[1:26:01] this message is everything that you have
[1:26:04] need of.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; What? Why? I don't know. You got a need
[1:26:08] here tonight. Somebody got a need. I I
[1:26:10] don't care whatever that need is. The
[1:26:12] answer lays within God's word. Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the revealed word
[1:26:17] of the hour by a vindicated prophet
[1:26:20] brings forth the word that can meet the
[1:26:23] challenge that you're going through and
[1:26:25] answer any questions that you have.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Say, what do you got need of?
[1:26:31] What is faith?
[1:26:33] Faith comes by what?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Hearing the word.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Not a word from another age.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Noah's message won't work.
[1:26:43] Moses message won't work. It has to be
[1:26:46] the message for the day that we are now
[1:26:49] living in.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; This message packs the revelation of
[1:26:53] everything that you have need of. We
[1:26:55] just find a quick place to close. But we
[1:26:57] know the scripture says, "Man shall not
[1:26:59] live by bread alone, but by every word
[1:27:02] that proceedth out of the mouth of God."
[1:27:05] Brother Brandham said that's where the
[1:27:07] church fail today is by disbelieving
[1:27:09] God's word.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Right? That's that's where they all fail
[1:27:13] because what God's word come by divine
[1:27:16] promise and was manifested and they
[1:27:19] failed to believe it. Many can come up
[1:27:22] so far. Many can come to water baptism.
[1:27:25] Many can uh uh uh accept serpent seed.
[1:27:29] Me many many many people can can come so
[1:27:32] far. But I you know where they can't
[1:27:34] come is recognizing
[1:27:37] the headship to the age.
[1:27:40] Come on.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; When it comes to recognizing Malachi 4:5
[1:27:45] is the fulfillment that the the the
[1:27:47] ministry of William Brandham is the
[1:27:49] fulfillment of scripture.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Now it goes from a feel-good story to a
[1:27:54] responsibility.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. Because now now it brings
[1:28:01] it now it's decision time. You see, you
[1:28:04] realize that just oh my, it was just so
[1:28:07] beautiful because just as in the days of
[1:28:09] Jesus, if Jesus was who he said he was,
[1:28:12] that meant all of their that all of the
[1:28:15] Sadducees, Pharisees, and the high
[1:28:17] priest had no more jobs.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's over.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Playing church is over.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; The the the the the the all the
[1:28:28] money-making schemes is over.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; All of our position over. Why?
[1:28:34] Because the Messiah is here.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And when Malachi 4:5 showed up, what did
[1:28:39] it mean? It meant playing church is
[1:28:41] over.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; All the personalities and all the
[1:28:46] workups and and all the pool and the the
[1:28:48] flash and the pan and the healing and
[1:28:50] the oil and and all of the signs and
[1:28:53] nonsense. The bride would never go
[1:28:56] playing. Church was over.
[1:28:59] The bride wants one thing and that's the
[1:29:01] word.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; And sure, signs and signs and wonders
[1:29:06] follow that word.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; But we know the devil can impersonate it
[1:29:10] all.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; There's one quote, brother Brandham says
[1:29:12] that that uh Janice and Jambers
[1:29:16] impersonated every gift up to the death
[1:29:18] angel.
[1:29:19] That threw my brain for a warp.
[1:29:23] What? one side he's saying what he was
[1:29:25] speaking flies into the create you know
[1:29:28] frogs and lice and all these things and
[1:29:30] here Janice and jammers are imitate how'
[1:29:32] they do that I don't know I just know
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; it happened
[1:29:38] how do you know it happened well I got
[1:29:40] an absolute
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; call me absolutely crazy but I'm
[1:29:44] absolutely going in a rapture
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; come on it's I think it's time we we get
[1:29:49] just as crazy as Abraham
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; you know I don't know yall talking about
[1:29:54] rapture? Are y'all talking about body
[1:29:57] change? You talking about the message? I
[1:29:59] don't know. What do you What do you
[1:30:00] spend your time talking about? If if we
[1:30:01] sat down and said, "Hey, what's the five
[1:30:02] things on your list you want to talk
[1:30:04] about?
[1:30:06] I mean, what do you want to talk about?
[1:30:08] Let's sit down for one hour.
[1:30:11] What do you want to talk about?"
[1:30:14] Now, I I would want to give you the
[1:30:16] opportunity to share what's on your
[1:30:17] heart,
[1:30:21] but I love to talk about this message.
[1:30:24] I love to talk about this word.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; You know what? I think we ought to have
[1:30:29] leaving on our mind.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to have going home on
[1:30:33] our mind. I think we ought to have lost
[1:30:35] souls on our mind. I think we should
[1:30:36] have revelation on our mind.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Because we're a people, we don't
[1:30:43] disbelieve one word.
[1:30:46] That's where the church failed is
[1:30:48] disbelieving one word. But the prophet
[1:30:50] of God, we'll just call for the
[1:30:51] musicians. We'll find a place to you
[1:30:53] know what? Hold it. I I don't I'm not
[1:30:54] going to do that to you again.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; When you come up, I want you to start
[1:30:58] playing right away when you hit that
[1:31:00] piano. So, just give me one moment,
[1:31:01] sister. I I' I've y'all for y'all I ask
[1:31:04] for forgiveness for that. I've left our
[1:31:05] musicians sitting up there too long and
[1:31:07] and I know I'm wrong for that. So, you
[1:31:08] forgive me. Let me try to I just uh work
[1:31:11] this towards a close quickly. Brother
[1:31:12] Brandham says and Jehovah Gyrus I've
[1:31:14] been listening to. says, "But in this
[1:31:15] case, to the royal seed called
[1:31:17] predestinated to eternal life, the royal
[1:31:19] seed of Abraham, they believe that word.
[1:31:21] I don't care what comes or goes, how
[1:31:24] much they laugh, who says this, that, or
[1:31:26] the other, they are ordained to eternal
[1:31:28] life." And she goes right straight back.
[1:31:31] Her and her lover, Christ is one, the
[1:31:33] life. The spirit that's in Christ is in
[1:31:36] the church. That's their eternal
[1:31:38] covenant. Look, I don't care what comes
[1:31:41] or goes.
[1:31:44] I don't know. I don't know what you're
[1:31:45] going through, but I don't care how bad
[1:31:48] it gets.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; What? What is he saying? Look, I don't
[1:31:52] care what comes or go, how much they
[1:31:55] laugh. Look, are they going to laugh?
[1:31:56] They're going to laugh. Are they going
[1:31:58] to make fun of you? They're going to
[1:31:59] make fun of you. And I tell you what, I
[1:32:01] think you ought to be putting yourself
[1:32:02] in position to be laughed at.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, but some of us never put
[1:32:09] ourselves into position.
[1:32:12] It's like that boy that went to the
[1:32:13] camp. Honey, when they find out you're a
[1:32:15] Christian, they're really going to give
[1:32:17] you a hard time. What happened when he
[1:32:19] got back? Say, "Oh, uh, honey, how'd it
[1:32:21] go?" "Oh, he went fine." Really? What'
[1:32:24] they do when they found out you're a
[1:32:25] Christian? Oh, mom, they never found
[1:32:26] out.
[1:32:30] Come on.
[1:32:31] I say some of us ought to be getting
[1:32:33] some boldness in the day of judgment to
[1:32:35] declare the message of the hour because
[1:32:36] I tell you, faith has works. It declares
[1:32:40] to the people around you that you are
[1:32:42] not of this world. Look, when mo when
[1:32:44] Abraham went to expressing his faith by
[1:32:47] his works. It was what man saw. Are you
[1:32:50] hearing what he's saying? James is
[1:32:53] saying the works, the works we have. Man
[1:32:56] ought to be seeing our works. It ought
[1:32:58] to be declaring there's an absolute and
[1:33:00] another hope than what the world has.
[1:33:04] But if we're just blended in,
[1:33:08] where's your works?
[1:33:11] Where's your faith? And if you don't
[1:33:12] have it, faith is dead. But there ought
[1:33:16] to be something welling up in you that
[1:33:18] says, "Look, I don't care what comes or
[1:33:20] what goes. They might make fun of me.
[1:33:22] They might laugh at me." What What did
[1:33:25] Brother Brandon say? They They laughed
[1:33:27] at him and said, "Oh, oh, you meant
[1:33:29] Josephine."
[1:33:32] They laughed at him. They made fun of
[1:33:34] him. But he had a revelation. And
[1:33:37] because he had a revelation, he declared
[1:33:39] to the public.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; He was going to have a son and his name
[1:33:45] was Joseph.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Now, when that child came along and it
[1:33:51] wasn't Joseph,
[1:33:53] he didn't sit back and say, "Oh, I guess
[1:33:56] that wasn't God.
[1:33:58] Oh, maybe it is Josephine. No, he had a
[1:34:02] revelation. Brother Brand said, "I don't
[1:34:04] care." They laugh and they scorn, but I
[1:34:06] couldn't find it in the Bible, but he
[1:34:08] said it was written on my heart.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I I want to tell you, this message ought
[1:34:15] to be written on your heart.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Rapture ought to be written on your
[1:34:19] heart. Leaving here ought to be written
[1:34:21] on your heart. Finding lost souls should
[1:34:24] be written on your heart. fighting for
[1:34:26] your brothers and sisters should be
[1:34:27] written on your heart because it's a
[1:34:29] revelation.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; It ought to be something just
[1:34:35] belching forth out of your life.
[1:34:41] I tell you,
[1:34:43] when you've met them,
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; uh when you've experienced it,
[1:34:51] you look at others and you want them to
[1:34:53] have what you've experienced.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said in that message we
[1:35:00] heard this morning, he says, "You don't
[1:35:01] stagger at the promise of God through
[1:35:02] unbelief, but you give praise to God."
[1:35:06] Know that it's got to happen. I don't
[1:35:08] care what the doctor says. Everything
[1:35:10] else will come in in all kind of way.
[1:35:12] But don't you believe it. It's a lie of
[1:35:14] the devil. Yes, sir. It's true.
[1:35:17] I'm in raptured condition already.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, the doctor looks at me. He don't
[1:35:24] think I'm in raptured condition. Maybe
[1:35:26] my brothers and sisters don't think I'm
[1:35:28] in raptured condition. But my absolute
[1:35:31] said,
[1:35:33] my absolute told me because I got the
[1:35:36] quickening power, I'm in raptured
[1:35:38] condition already.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Well, that makes me happy.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I can't miss it.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I am going in a rapture.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not looking for an event.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I know we'll meet him in the air.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's going to happen.
[1:35:59] I I I I can't tell you what the third
[1:36:02] pull will be, but I know what it is
[1:36:05] right now.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; So many people want to argue and debate
[1:36:09] about what it will be.
[1:36:11] I guess I'll find out.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Look, if if there's going to be a tent
[1:36:15] one day, I guess I'll be a part I'll be
[1:36:17] there. Trust me, I'll be there. Right.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, but but everybody puts their
[1:36:22] hope in something, some interpretation.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Some workup, some hope, and totally miss
[1:36:29] what we got right now.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; When a prophet tells me, I'm in rapture
[1:36:33] condition already. I don't have to
[1:36:35] necessarily look for an event. That's
[1:36:37] exactly what Mary and Martha were doing.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I know that I know that in the
[1:36:42] resurrection, my brother will rise.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus have to tell her? I
[1:36:47] am the resurrection. Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And when you're walking with Jehovah,
[1:36:51] you're walking with the rapture.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I I am the rapt. You're looking at the
[1:36:56] rapture. Why? Because the rapture is in
[1:36:58] me. I'm in raptured condition already.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother Brandham said
[1:37:04] this in Jehovah Gyra. He said, the
[1:37:07] question was, where is the seed you
[1:37:09] promised me? Talk about Abraham. How am
[1:37:11] I going to be it? The people are
[1:37:13] laughing at me saying, Abraham, the
[1:37:14] father of nations, been 15 years now.
[1:37:16] Now you're 85 years old. Where where
[1:37:18] where where is all your children at? How
[1:37:21] many children you got now, father of
[1:37:22] nations? See, making fun of him. But he
[1:37:25] staggered not. He stayed right with it.
[1:37:27] Made fun. Said, "Father of nations, now
[1:37:29] let's see how many children do you have
[1:37:30] this time?" Wanting to make fun because
[1:37:33] he was holding to God's promises,
[1:37:35] believing that he was able to keep that
[1:37:36] which he promised. He's more than able.
[1:37:40] He can provide his own sacrifice. He is
[1:37:44] Jehovah Gyra. He can provide and make
[1:37:47] way for what he promised.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say if anything, the very message
[1:37:53] that we have received, if you're
[1:37:55] wondering how, right here, he's Jehovah
[1:37:57] Gyra, he can provide and make a way for
[1:38:00] what he promised. It ain't going to be
[1:38:02] something you muster up. It ain't going
[1:38:04] to be something you work up. God will
[1:38:06] make a way for the promise.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Look, he's making a way for the body
[1:38:11] change. He's making a way for all these
[1:38:13] things. All as I know, as long as I stay
[1:38:16] with the word, if I walk with the word,
[1:38:18] if I stay with the absolute, then when
[1:38:20] the need arises, when the time comes,
[1:38:23] I'll step right into the manifestation
[1:38:25] of the promise because God is more than
[1:38:28] able.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah Gyra.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth,
[1:38:38] and the life.
[1:38:40] No man cometh unto me unto the father
[1:38:43] but by me. I want to tell you outside of
[1:38:47] Christ.
[1:38:49] Outside of the message of the hour is
[1:38:51] nothing but confusion,
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; darkness,
[1:38:55] chaos,
[1:38:59] man's opinions,
[1:39:01] disappointments,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; false hopes
[1:39:07] just lead you on
[1:39:10] so long you think so and then before you
[1:39:12] know it, you're looking for something.
[1:39:13] Have anybody ever been there? You're
[1:39:15] from one hope to another hope, but
[1:39:18] that's all that's out there.
[1:39:21] It's just gross darkness. And you know,
[1:39:24] I was I was ministering on that little
[1:39:25] dew drop. You know how brother Brandon
[1:39:28] says it was just formed in the night
[1:39:29] time, you know, and there there that
[1:39:32] little dew drop. It was it was formed
[1:39:33] there a in the night. And he says, "But
[1:39:36] as the sun starts to come up,
[1:39:39] as that sun starts to come up, it starts
[1:39:41] to shake.
[1:39:43] It it starts to glisten and it starts to
[1:39:46] shine and it starts to get happy.
[1:39:49] You say you little goo,
[1:39:52] why are you getting happy?
[1:39:55] Why are you getting excited?
[1:39:58] He say, why? Because you see that up
[1:40:00] there? It's declaring that I'm going
[1:40:04] back to where I came from.
[1:40:06] Now, just before service, I got to
[1:40:08] thinking about that little dew drop and
[1:40:11] and and and I I I looked this up and I
[1:40:13] thought, you know what? What causes that
[1:40:16] dew drop
[1:40:18] to go back? And and I just like this.
[1:40:21] You know what? It says heat. As the sun
[1:40:23] rises, the temperature of the air and
[1:40:25] surfaces on which de has formed
[1:40:27] increases. This heat provides the water
[1:40:30] molecules in the due drop with more
[1:40:32] kinetic energy energy causing them to
[1:40:34] move faster. I like that because you
[1:40:37] know eternity is just a little faster
[1:40:39] dimension.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; But this is this really got me. He said
[1:40:42] he said now what causes the dew drop?
[1:40:46] It's it's evaporation which means when
[1:40:49] water molecules on the surface of the
[1:40:51] dew drop gain enough energy
[1:40:55] they overcome the intermolecular forces
[1:40:58] holding them in a liquid state and
[1:41:00] escape into the air as a water vapor.
[1:41:04] This process is called evaporation. I
[1:41:06] got to thinking hallelujah I'm
[1:41:08] evaporating.
[1:41:12] I am evaporating.
[1:41:15] Why? Because the sun is up. The prophet
[1:41:17] of God said, "But just let the sun come
[1:41:19] up. Watch it go to shining. It's happy."
[1:41:22] Why? The sun is going to call it right
[1:41:24] back where it came from.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; That's the way with the Christian.
[1:41:27] Hallelujah. We know when we walk into
[1:41:30] the presence of God, something in us
[1:41:32] tells us that we come from somewhere and
[1:41:34] we're going back again by that power
[1:41:36] that's pulling us. The little dew drop,
[1:41:39] he glistens and he shines and he shouts
[1:41:41] because he knows he comes from up there.
[1:41:44] And that son is going to draw him right
[1:41:46] back up again. And a man that's an
[1:41:49] attribute of God born of God knows,
[1:41:51] hallelujah, when he comes in contact
[1:41:53] with the son of God, he is going to be
[1:41:55] drawled up from here someday. For if I
[1:41:58] be lifted up from the earth, I will draw
[1:42:00] all men unto me. Oh, praise God. I want
[1:42:03] to tell you, the sun is up. The sun is
[1:42:06] shining. Uh, what a resurrection that
[1:42:08] was. But what a resurrection this is.
[1:42:10] The sun is up. What is it declaring? I'm
[1:42:13] going back to where I came from.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The musicians would come. I
[1:42:22] want to sing that song. Uh, Speak to the
[1:42:25] Mountain.
[1:42:28] Church world has denominated and died
[1:42:30] and there's been personalities and
[1:42:32] movements. They've come and gone. But,
[1:42:34] Brother Brandham said in words of faith
[1:42:37] express, he said, "But oh God, they
[1:42:38] denominated. They went right back out to
[1:42:41] take man's ideas. Therefore now when the
[1:42:43] bride is being called as you've promised
[1:42:45] in in the scriptures
[1:42:48] reading it before the world night out
[1:42:49] night after night and we watch it with
[1:42:52] our own eyes God may it dissolve all the
[1:42:55] doubts in the people's heart may they fe
[1:42:58] flee quickly to the open sun to be
[1:43:00] ripened to be taken into the garner not
[1:43:02] be left in the stalk to be burned but
[1:43:05] may they go to the garner tonight
[1:43:09] I love how our pastor was laying in
[1:43:10] there he's a dissolver of doubt
[1:43:14] That word means to destroy, just to
[1:43:16] disintegrate.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said in in
[1:43:23] uh the greatest battle ever fought. He
[1:43:26] said, "Lust don't get a 22."
[1:43:31] God has an atomic bomb
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; called faith.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; He said it disintegrates.
[1:43:39] It annihilates devils left and right.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; He said it destroys and disintegrates.
[1:43:46] I say, why don't you just let the Lord
[1:43:48] come and anoint your faith,
[1:43:52] dissolve all the doubt and all the
[1:43:53] unbelief
[1:43:55] that you can go into action.
[1:43:58] Come on.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I'll leave you with this and maybe we
[1:44:02] can pick up on this sometime somehow.
[1:44:07] Brother Brandham says,
[1:44:11] he says, "You say, 'Is is that right,
[1:44:12] Brother Brandham? Then why does it on
[1:44:14] some and not on others?"
[1:44:17] He said, "It's because of the channel.
[1:44:20] You can look out and see it,
[1:44:24] but you've got to have it in here
[1:44:27] looking this way, not out there looking
[1:44:32] in.
[1:44:33] You got to be looking out.
[1:44:37] Friends, if we're always looking as the
[1:44:40] message as something we're trying to
[1:44:42] achieve,
[1:44:44] oh, I got to be this. A and we're always
[1:44:47] we're we're looking like that eagle that
[1:44:49] flew over the barnyard.
[1:44:51] If we're always just in the barnyard
[1:44:53] looking up, but no, that eagle has to
[1:44:57] come in you.
[1:44:59] And now it's Christ in me.
[1:45:03] making me what he wants me to be.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Not that it's a challenge
[1:45:09] like I got to make something happen, but
[1:45:10] that he promised it. And now, Lord, I'm
[1:45:13] going to surrender to that word.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get out of the way, Lord,
[1:45:17] and let you be in me what you want me to
[1:45:20] be. Not me try to be something on my
[1:45:23] own, but a total surrender. Would you
[1:45:25] like that?
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go ahead and stand.
[1:45:36] The germ that was in you at the
[1:45:38] beginning
[1:45:40] found you. That's what this message did.
[1:45:43] Showing you who you really were from the
[1:45:45] very beginning. Amen. I want to just
[1:45:47] sing this song.
[1:45:49] Amen. Why should I worry when giants
[1:45:53] come calling my name?
[1:46:00] My God is so much bigger than the
[1:46:04] troubles I face.
[1:46:10] Why would I hope for power or riches or
[1:46:15] fame?
[1:46:19] Cuz my God is so much better than all of
[1:46:24] these things.
[1:46:28] So I won't be shen
[1:46:33] and I won't be.
[1:46:38] My God is faithful.
[1:46:42] His promise is true.
[1:46:47] So I'll speak to the mountains.
[1:46:53] Oh, it's time to move.
[1:46:57] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:47:03] and greater than you.
[1:47:08] Oh, my enemies scatter.
[1:47:12] They know the battle's been fought.
[1:47:19] My God is stronger with me already.
[1:47:28] The king died my
[1:47:32] brother.
[1:47:39] My God is
[1:47:43] hell and the grave.
[1:47:48] I won't be shen
[1:47:52] or I won't be.
[1:47:58] My God is faithful.
[1:48:02] His promise is true.
[1:48:07] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[1:48:12] Oh, it's time.
[1:48:26] They just softly play that. I I just
[1:48:29] want to reemphasize this.
[1:48:34] Brother Brandon says it's because of the
[1:48:37] channel.
[1:48:39] You can look out and see it,
[1:48:42] but you've got to have it in here.
[1:48:46] Looking this way,
[1:48:49] not out there looking in.
[1:48:53] And I feel so many times
[1:48:58] as believers, we're we're looking at
[1:49:01] this stature of a perfect man or we're
[1:49:05] looking at the sheath wave or a first
[1:49:06] one to maturity and we're we're always
[1:49:11] trying to catch up or oh, I see it and
[1:49:15] and I need to be it.
[1:49:18] And what the prophet was telling me,
[1:49:19] "No, son, you're you're you're not
[1:49:22] looking at it out there. You got to get
[1:49:24] that out here and here."
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Does that speak to you?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And then when that comes in here,
[1:49:34] it'll start to change you.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; And then if you're you're you're doing
[1:49:39] something, you're like, "Oh Lord, help
[1:49:42] me. Father,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; change me." And I just thought maybe
[1:49:45] with every head bowed,
[1:49:48] maybe you feel like, you know what,
[1:49:50] that's exactly where I've been.
[1:49:53] I've been looking at the message. I I
[1:49:55] I've been looking at the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:57] I've been looking at the scriptures and
[1:49:59] and all of these things and I've I've
[1:50:01] been trying to manufacture or I've been
[1:50:04] trying to play catchup. I I've been
[1:50:06] trying to run after something and I can
[1:50:08] never catch it.
[1:50:11] And you're tired and you're wore out.
[1:50:14] tired of being up and down and in and
[1:50:16] out and you say, "Lord, I want what I
[1:50:19] see in this word to come into me,
[1:50:25] Lord. I I want you to come in.
[1:50:30] I just want to surrender Lord all
[1:50:32] everything to you Father where it's no
[1:50:34] longer me struggling and trying but it's
[1:50:37] me surrendering
[1:50:40] where I can start bearing wool not manu
[1:50:42] trying to manufacture
[1:50:45] I would just ask is there somebody here
[1:50:46] that you would want to lift up your
[1:50:48] hands say Lord I need what I see in this
[1:50:50] message in me I'm tired of trying to
[1:50:53] achieve it on my own God bless you maybe
[1:50:56] somebody you want the Holy Ghost and you
[1:50:57] want to lift your hand say God I need
[1:50:59] the Holy Ghost, I need some I need
[1:51:01] something more than I got. I say, "Oh,
[1:51:03] God, I need something more than I got."
[1:51:05] Lord, I I Lord, I I I want
[1:51:10] I want these works to be manifested in
[1:51:12] my life, Lord.
[1:51:15] God bless you. Hands that are just
[1:51:16] raised everywhere. I say, "Why? Why
[1:51:18] don't you just invite God to where
[1:51:19] you're at?
[1:51:21] Why don't you let God just deal with you
[1:51:23] in a supernatural way?" I just I feel
[1:51:25] impressed in my heart that as this
[1:51:27] prophet said, it's because of the
[1:51:29] channel.
[1:51:32] You you can see it out here. But now I
[1:51:34] say, "Oh God, let that revelation of the
[1:51:37] message now come in me."
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Just as he said at that day,
[1:51:45] that's this day. You'll know that I am
[1:51:47] in the father and the father in me. When
[1:51:50] the revelation of this message comes
[1:51:52] forth, then it's I and you and you and
[1:51:54] me. You're no longer struggling. You're
[1:51:56] no longer wondering why. Because you're
[1:51:58] now in a union with the word.
[1:52:02] And the Lord just deal with your heart.
[1:52:04] God bless each one of you that's lifted
[1:52:05] your hands, Lord Jesus.
[1:52:08] Lord, as we just bring this service to a
[1:52:10] close, Father, you see the many hands
[1:52:12] that have been lifted, Father. We've
[1:52:14] just tried to maybe bring a scripture or
[1:52:17] some quotes, Lord. maybe not knowing all
[1:52:20] of how or where what would be done, but
[1:52:22] Lord, I just pray something that has
[1:52:24] been said. Lord, I know that you're able
[1:52:25] to to take a broken up
[1:52:29] message, Lord, and just take a portion
[1:52:31] of it and feed your children.
[1:52:34] Lord, I pray that your word would just
[1:52:35] become such a reality to
[1:52:39] your children, Lord, that
[1:52:43] their works would start declaring their
[1:52:45] faith.
[1:52:47] Lord, you see the faith,
[1:52:49] but man sees the works.
[1:52:52] So Lord, may we be a total surrendered
[1:52:54] vessel. Lord, I just feel in my spirit
[1:52:57] you're doing something very special for
[1:52:59] somebody right now, Lord.
[1:53:02] Lord, I pray that there just be a full
[1:53:04] surrender right now and a total
[1:53:06] bornagain experience.
[1:53:09] Lord, you're the same yesterday, today,
[1:53:11] and forever. You're not a God of
[1:53:13] frustration.
[1:53:15] You're not a God that leaves us
[1:53:17] wondering and guessing.
[1:53:20] But Lord, you make things so plain.
[1:53:24] Lord, you make things so clear
[1:53:27] that even when our own carnal mind would
[1:53:31] not understand, Lord, there's a
[1:53:33] revelation of faith that anchors down to
[1:53:36] know it's thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:53:39] Lord, I just pray that you would bring
[1:53:41] that revelation to somebody here right
[1:53:43] now. Lord, for we know the new birth
[1:53:46] is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:53:48] personally to the individual. Lord, I'm
[1:53:51] so thankful you're still calling.
[1:53:54] Lord, that there's people that still
[1:53:55] have a desire to serve you.
[1:53:59] Maybe right now the devil's trying to
[1:54:01] tell somebody they've crossed the line
[1:54:03] and they've tried too many times. Lord,
[1:54:06] we know that devil's a liar.
[1:54:09] The very fact that they have a desire
[1:54:12] for the Holy Ghost proves
[1:54:15] that it's you and them calling out to
[1:54:18] your word and for the Holy Ghost to
[1:54:20] come. Father, I just commit them to you
[1:54:22] as we sing this song in Jesus Christ's
[1:54:24] name. Amen. I won't be shen.
[1:54:32] I won't be moved.
[1:54:37] Our God is faithful.
[1:54:41] His promise is true.
[1:54:46] So I'll speak to the mountain.
[1:54:51] Oh, it's time to
[1:55:02] pray.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; I like this song. So help me learn. Sing
[1:55:06] the first verse. Amen.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; My God is so much fear in the trouble
[1:55:22] that I
[1:55:28] will honor power which is your name.
[1:55:37] My God is so much better than all the
[1:55:43] things.
[1:55:46] So I won't be shy.
[1:55:56] My God is faithful.
[1:56:01] His promise is true.
[1:56:05] So our streets and mountains
[1:56:10] for each time.
[1:56:16] Our God is bigger, better, stronger,
[1:56:21] gater.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] God before you.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Who can be against you?
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, just think how wonderful it is.
[1:56:31] I really like that. what the prophet
[1:56:34] said, Matthew brought up that you've got
[1:56:37] to look at it from the inside.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; So, it's not something out there that
[1:56:43] you're trying to grab a hold of. It's
[1:56:46] something that's in you
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; by seed.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Can you understand that?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; The revelation that God gave you was the
[1:56:55] seed. You were the bedding ground.
[1:56:59] And when that seed came in, it's in the
[1:57:01] same book that he read out of of the
[1:57:03] works his faith expressed. He said that
[1:57:06] seed comes into the bedding ground and
[1:57:09] then it's got a place to grow and you
[1:57:12] grow in to faith. You know, none of us
[1:57:17] started out as giants.
[1:57:20] You know, I I I thought I had more faith
[1:57:23] when I was a young preacher
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; than I do now, but I now I know I have
[1:57:29] to rely on him
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; more than ever. And that seed and the
[1:57:35] prophet of God said every gift, every
[1:57:38] fruit
[1:57:40] that's ever in that tree
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; was in that seed. And I just thought as
[1:57:45] Matthew preached, he talked about all
[1:57:47] the power that the believer has to
[1:57:51] overcome. And I thought about Moses with
[1:57:55] that stick in his hand to go down, take
[1:57:58] over Egypt.
[1:58:00] And I I thought of the Lord, how that he
[1:58:04] could spoke anything. And then I thought
[1:58:08] about our prophet messenger pro probably
[1:58:10] the three most powerful men that were
[1:58:14] ever on the face of the earth.
[1:58:16] And you want to know the most amazing
[1:58:18] thing about him? Moses was the meakest
[1:58:21] of all men.
[1:58:24] Jesus and was was was
[1:58:28] so I can't express it just full full of
[1:58:32] love and caring and brother Brandham how
[1:58:35] humble that he was
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; and and that nature and I thought you
[1:58:40] know that that's the only way we're ever
[1:58:43] going to get across to this world what
[1:58:46] it is that the revelation that we have
[1:58:50] was when we can approach this world with
[1:58:53] the character and love of Jesus Christ
[1:58:55] in our heart.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Because remember, your actions speak
[1:59:01] louder than your words. And and I I just
[1:59:05] you know,
[1:59:08] you know, at the end of that tape, I
[1:59:09] don't want to keep you any longer, but
[1:59:11] that part of the tape we listened to
[1:59:13] this morning where brother Ram said, "If
[1:59:16] you do the works of mount, if Jesus did
[1:59:18] the things that said about him that were
[1:59:21] spoken, then it must have been him." And
[1:59:24] then he said, "Now ma, you know, if if
[1:59:27] it says the angels would come and they
[1:59:29] came and and and he said Malachi 4 and
[1:59:32] he was here and he he said all those
[1:59:35] things. And you know what he did right
[1:59:36] after that? He turned his back to the
[1:59:39] audience. He discerned he he called out
[1:59:42] and discern the thoughts that he had. He
[1:59:44] put on total display
[1:59:47] everything that he he did right there in
[1:59:50] Jack Moore's church in Shreveport,
[1:59:53] Louisiana. And he just said they just
[1:59:55] can't believe the message.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; But you did, didn't you?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; If that isn't the love of God,
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the love of God is.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Why he ever chose me?
[2:00:12] How did he choose you? Why? How out of
[2:00:15] the whole world did he pick you?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Because he loved you first.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; And then you could just be so grateful.
[2:00:25] If you got believing parents, you ought
[2:00:27] to be grateful.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you're if your parents
[2:00:32] love this message, you ought to be so
[2:00:34] happy and you ought to be thankful that
[2:00:37] God did it. and and and I I really
[2:00:40] honestly believe what's going to strike
[2:00:43] this world and this hour is when there's
[2:00:46] a people that have that character cuz
[2:00:48] power apart from character is satanic.
[2:00:52] You're not going to move anybody until
[2:00:55] that love of God is shed abroad in your
[2:00:57] heart
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. So you we've we have
[2:01:02] it.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; It's ours now. We just need to get the
[2:01:06] revelation of it and believe because I
[2:01:09] think God's fixing to move. And that's
[2:01:12] your personal relationship with Jesus
[2:01:14] Christ. As Matthew said there, he said
[2:01:17] the ev the Holy Ghost is the personal
[2:01:21] revelation of Jesus Christ to you. It's
[2:01:24] a personal revelation that God gives
[2:01:27] you. And God leaves his church by divine
[2:01:31] revelation. Let's stay humble, church.
[2:01:34] Let's let's share with all humility and
[2:01:39] meekness of spirit and loneliness of
[2:01:42] heart all that we have in humility.
[2:01:47] And and watch the world
[2:01:50] respond.
[2:01:52] The world is tired of being yelled at.
[2:01:55] They're wanting people that'll lend a
[2:01:57] helping hand. You know, today we're at
[2:01:59] the restaurant and there's a little
[2:02:02] group of Pentecostal
[2:02:05] uh Spanish brothers and sisters came in
[2:02:08] and my heart was just a thumping, you
[2:02:10] know, cuz they were dressed right, you
[2:02:13] know, and they loved one another and
[2:02:15] just a little group and and but we
[2:02:18] helped them. I don't know where
[2:02:20] Michael's at. Yeah, we I don't know if
[2:02:22] he's here, but we helped take their
[2:02:24] dishes, their trays to the table and
[2:02:27] everything and you know, and I finally
[2:02:30] just stood up and they're missing. I
[2:02:31] said, you know, I appreciate you. Don't
[2:02:33] let the world come in and and and keep
[2:02:37] keep holy and keep your dresses and
[2:02:40] don't cut your hair and don't start
[2:02:42] putting on makeup. And I didn't even go
[2:02:44] to their church,
[2:02:46] you know what I mean? But they was amen
[2:02:49] because people are hungry,
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; church. They're starving, hungry for
[2:02:56] what you have. And I encourage you to
[2:02:59] take the encouragement from tonight.
[2:03:02] Don't be afraid to speak it. You know,
[2:03:05] even our messenger said, "God can do
[2:03:07] nothing for you till you confess it
[2:03:10] first."
[2:03:12] So, I think we're on we're heading down
[2:03:14] the right road. We're We're heading down
[2:03:17] the right road. Let the love of God be
[2:03:19] shed abroad in our heart by the Holy
[2:03:22] Spirit. Amen. You believe that with all
[2:03:25] your brother Jay, would you come dismiss
[2:03:27] us in prayer tonight?
[2:03:41] Heavenly Father, we just
[2:03:46] Lord, it's good to be in your presence
[2:03:47] this evening, Lord. And
[2:03:50] Lord, just to feel your
[2:03:53] spirit come by, Lord. And
[2:03:56] just touch, Lord, the areas that we
[2:03:58] need, Lord.
[2:04:01] Lord, we just we're we're desperate for
[2:04:03] you, Lord, to
[2:04:05] just be manifested in our lives, Lord.
[2:04:08] And Lord, we're desperate for a change,
[2:04:11] Lord Jesus.
[2:04:13] Lord, a change that is a permanent
[2:04:15] change, Lord. Not a moment, Lord,
[2:04:20] but Lord, that something that is,
[2:04:25] Lord, evident to our family members,
[2:04:28] Lord, that aren't here, Lord, or our
[2:04:29] friends, Lord, that we come in contact
[2:04:31] with, Lord. And
[2:04:35] Lord, we just want to be still, Lord,
[2:04:36] and be in your presence, Lord. And just
[2:04:39] ask that you would, Lord, just come seal
[2:04:42] that word in our hearts, Lord. As the
[2:04:44] prophet said, Lord, let your word be
[2:04:46] written on our hearts, Lord. And
[2:04:49] Lord, we just ask for your spirit, Lord,
[2:04:53] just to
[2:04:55] take control, Lord, of everything in our
[2:04:57] heart, our minds, Lord. And Lord, just
[2:05:00] lead us and guide us, Lord. every step,
[2:05:02] Lord.
[2:05:04] Lord, we just we we need that, Lord,
[2:05:07] more than anything right now.
[2:05:10] Lord, and we just ask that you would
[2:05:12] strengthen us, Lord. each one, the
[2:05:14] ministers, Lord, the
[2:05:16] the church members, Lord, and
[2:05:20] just ask that you would go with us this
[2:05:22] evening, Lord, beyond these four walls,
[2:05:25] Lord Jesus,
[2:05:27] Lord, to wherever we may go, Lord, to
[2:05:29] work, to school,
[2:05:31] Lord, our homes, Lord. Just ask that,
[2:05:35] Lord, you'd be with us, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:39] We just want to thank you Lord and just
[2:05:42] ask that you would
[2:05:45] Lord just bless each one this evening in
[2:05:47] Jesus name.
[2:05:49] Amen.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. Have a
[2:05:54] great week. Huh?
[2:05:57] Tell somebody that you love them. Tell
[2:06:00] somebody that Jesus loves them. Amen.
[2:06:04] Let your light so shine amongst men that
[2:06:07] your good works will glorify your father
[2:06:09] in heaven. I like this song. So let's
[2:06:12] sing this as our dismissal song. I won't
[2:06:14] be shaken. I won't be moved. Amen. So I
[2:06:18] won't be shen.
[2:06:23] I won't be moved.
[2:06:28] My God is faithful.
[2:06:32] His promise is true.
[2:06:37] I'll speak to this mountain.
[2:06:42] Oh, it's time to move.
[2:06:48] My God is bigger, better, stronger
[2:06:53] than you.
[2:06:57] fighting for heavy scatter cuz they know
[2:07:02] the battle is done.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my God is stronger. The victory
[2:07:12] already won.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; You died my
[2:07:21] rose up on the earth.
