Description:
She Hath Declared Him: Prophesy Being Fulfilled
Br. Matthew McGeary
Sunday Evening Service: November 15th,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

us protecting us and you've brought us here to this place tonight so we're looking to the tinder hand of jehovah once again just to come and do what only you can do lord and break the bread of life to your people we surrender ourselves to you both the speaker and the hearer that you might just have the preeminence in this service we pray we love you now lord we ask all these things and commit it to you in the precious and wonderful name that name that's above all names the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen hallelujah amen if we can go ahead and turn in our bibles we'll be reading out of acts chapter 8. thank you musicians acts chapter 8 verse 26 through 35. amen just pray that god would give me strength in my voice and strength and power of the holy ghost to deliver the burden that's upon my heart as we just believe together acts chapter 8 verse 26 through 35 i believe we'll be reading says in the angel of the lord spake unto philip saint arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem onto gaza which is desert and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia a eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasures and had come to jerusalem for to worship was returning and sitting in his chariot read isaiah the prophet then the spirit of the lord said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot and philip ran thither to him my it just struck me just in the reading of scripture the lord spoke to philip and he ran i pray i pray god when you speak to my heart may i be diligent to to be obedient to thy word and fulfill it as you have spoken it and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet isaiah and said understand us thou what thou readest that's a good question you know you can ask that question to the nominal church world we can ask that question to ourself when you listen to a tape did you understand what you just listened to let's get beyond the carnal understanding let's get revelation said understand us thou what thou readist and he said how can i except some man should guide me amen and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him and the place of the scripture which he had read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shear so opened he nod his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee i tell you what he was asking the right person i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus amen we just had a blessing upon the word you may be seated also just want to read out of john chapter 1 verse 18. i think that's such a beautiful portion of scripture there uh phillip opened his mouth and preached jesus and and just if you keep reading there and philip preaching jesus they they ended up at the water that's what happens when you preach jesus in john 1 18 it says no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and i just what's on my heart and just reading the very end of that scripture it says no man had seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him and just the burden that's upon my heart is is to say that she hath declared him and that would be maybe my the title of the sermon would be she have declared him and maybe uh just to help our minds uh in a certain direction maybe as a subject i want to say prophecy being fulfilled and just in reading out of the mighty god unveiled before us the bible said no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him so moses saw him veiled as a man and we find that jehovah of the old testament was jesus of the new testament and dr schofield here says we find that his word changing from form we find the word in morphe in the greek which means the unseen was made visible we know it's there it cannot be seen but yet we know that it's there and when he changed his form for in morphe which means that he changed from supernatural to natural he just changed his mask and otherwise it's like a drama he was acting in the greek when they would change their mask maybe one play one player might have acted in several different parts my daughter present here they just had a high school drama and one boy that i know played out about four parts but he would go behind the stage and change his mask in order to come out to impersonate another character now if you will just take the old testament prophecies concerning what the messiah was to be you can compare it with the life of jesus and you got exactly who jesus was he was not just an ordinary man oh if i could just run with that a little bit and say you're not just an ordinary church you're not just an ordinary bride amen he was god in morphe he was changed from the supernatural into the natural form of a man yet he was god manifested in the flesh veiled by a human fleshly veil and we know in the scripture and in john 1 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was gone and as our prophet picks up that scripture he takes that word and he says you know that that word w-o-r-d actually means logos and he starts to show that the the definition of that word or logos it means the very thought or the very he got to a man that was in his own image and the prophet goes on to say that that but that that image fell that masterpiece family that god had there in the in the garden of eden it had failed but but oh as we heard this morning he wasn't willing leave it lay there but the prophet says he kept brooding over the earth and he says oh he kept brooding and he raised up a noah and he raised up an enoch and he and he raised up a dave and he raised up these ones through the scripture all that had a part but what was he doing he was brooding over the earth coming back until he got back to perfection again until he got back to the word made flesh a man in his image which was jesus christ it was the logos and we know that john 1 14 it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us oh it was a fleshly veil the the logos of the fullness of the godhead bodily was dwelling in the man jesus christ the prophet says the very substance of god oh the logos was made flesh and dwelt among us you think about how elohim once no man can see there are the children of israel they were led by a pillar of fire they they saw a cloud by day moses saw the back part of a man passed by him but no one had ever seen him but here comes jesus christ declaring him that no man has ever seen god made flesh dwelling amongst us he says that he but now became emmanuel god with us declaring himself brother branham uh as he references the scripture he goes declare in the greek root exegesis means to thoroughly explain and make clear he says that is what the living word jesus did he brought god to us for he was god he brought god to us for he was god oh think of it he took the written word he took all of the prophecies he took the laws everything that had been pinned down and the old testament here come the word made flesh and what did he do he made the bible a reality he made it real he took the written word and he was the living word being making that written word a reality before him oh my how beautiful it is i i was just thinking of of a blueprint of a house you can have everything on paper but it's not a reality until the blueprints have been built and the house has been constructed and it's all been finished out and you can actually walk into it you know some people are a little bit more visionary they they can look at the blueprints and i and i would say as my dad being a builder you could give him a set of blueprints and he could look through it and through that experience and through that knowledge of being a builder he can have a concept or an idea and he could just look at it and say yeah i see it i see what it is that's laying there i can see i know i i got an idea of how big and you know and then an expert can look at and say well you might want to do this and you might want to do that oh i just love how jesus took the written word and he made it a reality and oh how we got to get the words off of the bible and it got to become a living reality to us oh that's why jesus stood there or he was he was led after the spirit come upon him and he was led up there in the wilderness and there satan comes to tempt him and i love how the scripture says that he fasted for 40 days i believe and after he had fasted 40 days he was a hungered and then the devil tempted him you know i wouldn't have done the devil any good to tempt him while he was under that god called fast but he fasted for 40 days and not to get off on a little side thing but i thought you know my our lord fasted for 40 days how many of us have even fasted one day or two day maybe we ought to pray lord obey we ought to be open the lord if you want me to have a fast put it on my heart we got some needs we got some burdens in the church maybe i can get out of the way and allow you to speak and deal with my heart and i can get to a place where i can be part of the plan of god but there after he had fasted all the great tempter was there and he was tempting him and and he said why don't you just turn this this stone in the bread and what did the word say it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god while he was making that written word a reality oh and then he took him uh uh am i what what a you just your mind tries to grasp what dimensions and and where were they going and what was he seeing and he hadn't eaten for 40 days and here's the tempter and and satan is showing jesus his eaten he's taking him and showing i don't doubt he saw satan's eating he saw this all these nations and all this grand things and all of his economy and he said all you got to do is just bow down and worship me and you can have all this technology you can have a little box where you say uh google and you have all the knowledge of the tree knowledge of good and evil right at the tip of your fingers but he said all of this is yours if you'll just bow down and worship me and oh jesus said it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only thou thou shall thou serve and so then he takes them up on a high a mountain or some pinnacle and he says all right well i couldn't get you with the food i can't get you with the worshiper well why don't you go ahead and prove something to me why don't you go and prove to me that you're the bride of christ why don't you go go ahead and do something that's not written in the word why don't you try to uh fulfill something that is not in the will of god to be fulfilled oh he does the same thing to do i don't know about you but i've tried to make a little chandelier thing move on the wall look there's something in me that wants to man there's something in me wants faith when the prophet of god told that little girl that was sick and dying in the bed and she said i got faith he goes no you don't he said all right we'll make that little thing hanging down from the chandelier move well i don't know about you but that strikes a little fear a little conviction a little uncertainty in your heart and you're like i can make it move move i got faith and it won't move oh the message has a way of stripping you bare if you think you're somebody you better watch out you need to look into the mirror of god's word we're nothing without him oh and and and then he goes he says to him well go ahead and cast myself down and then he uses the word to him does it the word said look the prophet spoke squirrels in existence you can speak quarrels and just go ahead and do it it better be a divine inspiration moving of the holy ghost or you're just going to be a disappointed discouraged believer have been there oh because something in us wants to manifest the word but i say he who is faithful and little is faithful much and a prophet stood there over and over and over said how can i teach them algebra if they won't learn their abcs i think the message believers need a checkup of their abcs how are you gonna expect to learn algebra when we we haven't even learned our abcs we haven't even got the dressing right we ain't even got the the witnessing right we ain't even gotten visiting the widows and the afflicted and testifying things right hey it's all right but if there's a genuine hunger as our pastor was talking about to fulfill these things oh in that right season in that right time you just look for the opportunity and god is going to bring these things to pass in your life he stood there and he stood there before the sadducees and pharisees and he said i and my father are one and they took up stones to kill him to stone him and he said why why are you picking up stones to stone me for which good work do you stone me for they say we're not going to stone you for all the good works that you do but we're gonna stone you because you blasphemy and you make yourself god and he said now is it not written in your scriptures ye are god's that to whom the word of the lord comes to and the scripture can't be broken what was it it was the word a living reality standing before them jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever oh my i feel up there he's standing there think of all the things that jesus had done before their eyes and philip says show us the father and it sufficeth us and jesus looks at him and says have i been with you so long have i been with you so long he who has seen me has seen the father why because it was that word that logos that was in tabernacle in a fleshly veil and it was none other than elohim made flesh oh i love how jesus said think not that i am come to destroy the law of the prophets i have not come to destroy but to fulfill what a statement what a statement i have not come to do away with the law when i have come to fulfill the law there was no man that could fulfill all the law outside of that the law had called for a kinsmen redeemer there was no man that could lay his life down and take it back up again other than the one it was spoken of that's why he could stand there and he could tell them tear down this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again why because the word said i will not suffer my holy one deceit corruption i will not leave his soul in hell that's why he can say the very things that he said he was the true mercy seat man had fallen and needed a kinsmen redeemer and hear the word god himself had come to fulfill his own law oh such wonderful love the high priest would go back behind the veil oh he'd sprinkle the mercy seat seven times but they could never fulfill all the law that's why paul said in hebrews 10 4 he said for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body thou hast prepared me and burn off burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast no pleasure then said lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god oh hallelujah what was he doing he was declaring he was bringing to pass he was fulfilling everything that was spoken of him the logos the word made flesh and i want to tell you you are a part of that logos when when did you become a part of that logos oh we know the word says according as he has chosen you in him before the foundation of the world that you should be holy you're going to be holy you're going to be without blame before him in love why because you were with him all the way back there before he even said let there be light you were identified with them right there oh the prophet said when moses parted the red sea you were there you had to be because you're identified with them he said when jesus christ rose on that easter morning you were there because you're identified with him and he said that when he poured out his holy spirit there on pentecost you are there because you're identified with them oh the word being expressed out of christ the mystery of god revealed prophet says listen closely now again as we go on going back to the original eden oh hallelujah in this service he's preaching the threefold mystery purpose of christ which was first to express himself in jesus christ the logos becoming flesh second was to have the preeminence in his church to have the preeminence in his bride i say oh god i believe that's where uh we are is him many of us allowing him to have the preeminence in us and thirdly to take us back to eden going back to the original eden then we are born of him we are filled with him see your life his life is in you then all our actions should declare him it's like taking life out of one tree don't fail this now this simple illustration that god is wanting you to catch it's like taking life out of one tree and putting it into another taking life out of a pear tree and put it in an apple tree it'll bear pears it's got to because the sap the life in it the germ is pear all right then all of our actions should declare him why why because it's his life living in you old things have passed away all things have become new it's not i that liveth but christ that liveth in me so then that means there was an old life in you that now has died and another life has come in and taken residency i'm reminded of how the our lord warned us look you can sweep the house clean but those spirits will go out there and wonder and they'll come back seven worse we got you can do a diet out but we got to get filled with his spirit it's like taking life out of one tree out of the bridegroom tree and putting it in the bride tree and then what will it do it will bear the same results it'll bear the same life it'll bear the same fruits the same works that i do you'll do also because it's me living in you i love how brother branham takes the scripture of joel 2 28 where when peter come out of there out of the upper room and said men and brethren we are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which the prophet joel had prophesied that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh the prophet picks that up he says that word poor now when you look into it in the english it's almost something like vomited up or something else went out of him because he goes no it's the word canosis he poured himself out in other words he changed his form or he changed his mask from one thing to the other like taking the life out of one tree and put it in another he's not over here anymore he's moved over to here this is where he is he's now veiling himself in a different form in a different mass the prophet of god says oh there on pentecost he came and he veiled the logos word was veiled there in jesus christ but he died he completed that part of kinsman redeemer and he rose from the grave and he breathed upon his disciples and said receive ye the holy ghost go there in tarry and wait for the comforter to come and the prophet said on the day of pentecost he could gnosis he changed from the son of man to the son of god he had now changed his veil and now he was living in a people that were doing the same signs performing the same wonders because it was the same god now living in his bride that's why when the logos came there and struck down saul on the way to damascus oh he recognized what that was but what did he say what did the lord say to him so why do you persecute me i imagine saul's like lord who are you that i could persecute you it wasn't that he was persecuting a a flaming fire you couldn't persecute that fire that was burning on the mountain up there uh i'm talking about physically now but he says saul why persecuted me he said he said i am jesus where where was jesus christ he was living in his purchased possession living out the word he was building back up to something there was something in his mind a blueprint something that he was wanting to accomplish something that he wanted to achieve and he had changed his form he had changed his mass and now he was in his people god with skin on him oh that's what the badger skin always represented it was just a type the pillar of fire came down and tabernacled itself behind badger skin oh you think of a badger why badger skin oh all of us my the prophet talks about you watch out what's behind the skin yeah they might used to be that way might have been a sinner might have been a drunkard might have been this or that but what's behind the skin oh praise god he made a way that we could be forgiven and we can receive the holy ghost that now it's his life that's behind the skin god pouring himself out christ in you the prophet said god pouring himself into the human being and to the believer pour out it was part of his drama to do so oh we wanted to have the preeminence where all of our actions are declaring him we know all the all the acts of all the patriarchs and david and job all of them were just acting out their part of the drama as brother billy so beautifully preached on they were all declaring him the prophet said that all the acts of all the believers have just been in type expressing what god's great goal was and now in the last days he has revealed and shows it now in the last days he reveals and shows it all the acts everything down through all the bible we're just in types and things that god was wanting to reveal and show in this day i was thinking about rebecca you know no no doubt she's uh uh being a a good daughter there at the home and she's serving her mom and her dad and here comes some old man to town and she's out there at the well and he starts to tell her this story about some guy from some wealthy man from a a land far away that has a son and uh the lord showed me that you're gonna be his bride imagine imagine this pitch well let's go tell my parents hey mom this guy i met this old man out of the well and he's he's actually a servant of a wealthy man in a land far away and he wants me to marry his his son uh i'm calling the police uh honey you need to come in we're going to call the police and the authorities uh whoever this child abductor is but no no think uh think of this type that's in the bible this this type isn't it's a type for us to be able to look back into the word and see that type of that eliezer call here comes ellie easer he's making a call for a bride and something in rebecca's heart was crazy enough to believe it something in her was put there and so when they come back and tell her parents her parents say well the child is old enough to answer for herself amen and she said i'll go but i want to tell you there there came a time where confession met action a lot of people confess they believe the message a lot of people confess that they're following the message a lot of people say they believe what the eliza call has said but are they going to where eliezer has taken them oh my when you've left your family and by god's grace i never i never had to do some of those hard things that i know some of you have jesus said i come not uh he said i come with a sword i'll separate my mother from daughter and father from son and and oh it happens and rebecca had to come to a place where her confession of saying i will go where she actually left and said goodbye to everything that she ever had known and i pray oh god may the elies or call of this message take me away from everything that ever thought in my mind every idea and every uh false thing that i've ever conceived in my mind oh i just want to know more about him and that's why the prophet was sent do you imagine the conversations on that journey you're on it oh ellie's been talking to you the whole time there's an old song eliezer tell me more oh there's nothing like it but you know a lot of people start out think about a lot of people start out on the journey they get going a little bit you know just like lot's wife started out got there but there was something back there she just turned i'm reminded of how our pastor pointed out this morning just a wink she's walking and just a turn don't do it church quit winking at the world quit looking back we we we could go on a sidetrack in all the ways that you can do that but i pray that the holy ghost would convict your heart right now and right now be brought to you remember to all the ways that you're winking at the world don't do it keep your eyes stayed on christ keep your eyes on the message keep following right in line i don't care if the burning world of satan's eating back here is calling for you there's something else that's calling your name and that's leading you back to eden don't turn around don't do it a lot of people start out some of you all have been believing this message for a while some of y'all saw 1977 come and go a lot of people fell away a lot of people here recently over the course of several years i would say fell away you think that's something new one day jesus was going along and the prophet of god said jesus had to shake some parasites off of them jesus just had to shake some parasites off of them he said the prophet said he had too many people following him well that's not christian how dare him say something and you think you're a christian saying we all come how we are just god doesn't look look on the outside he looks on the inside no jesus had to shake some parasites off of them one time because too many people were following him so what did he say that the prophet points out he had his disciples which were the twelve knowing one of them was the devil he had the seventy which the prophet says was the ministerial association and he had the congregation by the thousands and one day probably was the day that you invited your mother-in-law or your family or your in-laws to church and the pastor decides to play this day this scripture is fulfilled and he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part of me oh the congregation by the thousand gone i don't know maybe that was 1977 who knows i'm not trying to make anything up here but a lot of people left i'm really not trying to make anything up so don't don't follow that but in type that's what the word does people can follow so far but they can only go along with it so far and he says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me oh i love how the prophet dramatizes that says oh man some doctor out there i'm like what i mean can you imagine this what is he a vampire this ain't any kind of way to live so there goes the thousands so he was left with the 12 in the ministerial association of the 70. and somehow you know that 70 they thought they were just going to plug on through you know some people come for the fishes and the loaves some are enamored by that first pool in that second pool oh my but when it comes to that third pool that opening word when it comes to the revealed word of the hour oh there's something that just starts shaking things and he goes all right and what does the prophet say i love this he says he never explained it he never explained it he just said it never explained it says the disciples could you imagine them thinking that how are we supposed to eat his flesh and drink his blood but they were predestinated think of it he just told them to eat his flesh and drink his blood he didn't explain it so he kept going and he goes well what happens when you see the son of man ascending into the clouds from once he came not about that time the ministerial association they said all right that's about all we can handle and they go and what was left it was just the 12 there that was left and he turned to him and said will you go also will you go also he didn't even explain anything to him will you go also and i love how uh peter says those words where are we gonna go where are we gonna go thou alone has those words of eternal life you realize that shaking is still going on today oh it's still shaking look we got plagues coming that are shaking there's things in the world that are shaking and if it can be shaken it's going to be shook but there is a people no matter what is said no matter what the word says something that says i believe it i can't explain it and it doesn't have to be explained to me but something in me says amen to the word of god and you'll never been shaken away from this message because it's thus saith the lord which you're a part of you're a part of thus saith the lord you are the word you're a part of that logos you'll never turn back we don't need psychology we don't need explaining ah look i i hate to say it this way but but the more i the more i dig in and dig into the message and the more that's revealed to me the the less i realize i don't even know oh it's almost a paradox and and you go along so long and you hear it over and over and you've been serving the lord 20 years and all of a sudden clicks and you're almost like well i'm almost embarrassed to even say that 20 years of believing this thing i've been even preaching it and there it is it's been right there in front of me all on but that's how great god is we're going higher and higher into higher heights into deeper depths oh we're going all the way there's no period on what we believe there's more for you if you can believe it you can have it oh he says he says and remember we are now his bride pregnant with his spirit oh my the church bearing children impregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminences evident of his resurrection showing that he's not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and it vindicates to the world that we're alive in him how do you know because you're a church member because christ is living through you now i want to say that's the other side of the prophecy we heard this morning how we can look at satan's eden and we've seen all the prophecies being fulfilled but there's more coming i got news for you it's going to get worse and if the lord tarries we're going to be sharing another quote showing look what else has been fulfilled because every single one of them will come to pass some of the differences whether we'll be here or not to see it ourselves satan's eden is going to get worse but don't let that discourage you that's the other side of the prophecy there's another side of the prophecy where the life that was in the bridegroom tree is now in the bride tree going to bring to pass every single word that the prophet spoke of the bride oh hallelujah christ in you his life bringing forth his evidences his signs my mom i look bringing his signs of life as an evidence of his resurrection proving to the world that eternal life vindicates to the world that we're alive in him and think of it alive with god our redeemer who created us for this very purpose the church and his creative life is in us his creative life is in you you know prophet said a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent you know what omnipotent means all powerful we saw a man in this generation fully surrendered to god and he was omnipotent amen i have no qualms to say that because he said it and that was the word made flesh and it's thus saith the lord he said a man fully surrendered to god is omnipotent and then of course what does he do he takes you to the scripture and says if you say to this mountain and you don't doubt in your heart and you believe what you asked for you're going to have it it's going to happen amen he says oh when two omnipotents meet something has to shake oh hallelujah he's not asking us to do something he ain't already done or showed us in the word we saw one with the creative life in him he said i now know what the third pull is and what it does and he demonstrated it oh thank you lord for that first one that came to maturity to show me what the power is of this word that he's placed inside of me will produce and i'm not going to stop short i'm going to believe for every single word that he spoke to be manifested in my life and i don't want to let one of them fall short because it's for me it's for you oh we that hunger and that thirst for righteousness let's don't be satisfied with the knowledge of the message that we've received let's hunger and thirst for the manifestation of the message and what has been spoken to become a reality just like the word that was made flesh and made the written word a reality now the spoken word that has been spoken by the prophet is becoming a reality in the bride oh there's a people whose lives are the very manifestation of that spoken word oh if there's somebody that can preach calvary like philip if there's somebody that can preach jesus it's the bride of jesus christ let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god be there for perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect casting down imaginations in every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god yes lord let me be like philip okay lord show me lord i want to do this i want to manifest this his life in you all of our actions declare in him it's like taking life out of one tree and putting it into another questions and answers they asked brother branham they say brother branham is is the bride of christ and the body of christ the same listen to what he says he says yes sir when god gave adam his bride from his side he said she is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone is that right when god gave christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride remember the supernatural becoming natural he changing his veil he said when god gave christ his bride the spirit gave the flesh the bride he was pierced in the side under his heart and water blood and spirit came forth that become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone we are the flesh and blown the bride will be the flesh and bone of christ exactly that is his bride that is his bride you were taken from his side i'm glad i don't have to explain that i've tried to figure that out many times and you even try to imagine oh but praise god i don't have to figure it out i just have to believe it and he said it you were there in jesus christ when he was hanging on the cross and the prophet said he had to die and once he was smitten there that spear was stuck into his side and out of there came water blood and spirit and you are part of that mystery that was in jesus christ christ is the mystery of god revealed and the pride is the mystery of christ revealed hallelujah you were part of him you were in him you came out from his side and you're the same life bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh isaiah 53 8 says he was taken from prison oh i think i'm just ready now to start preaching he was taken from prison isaiah 53 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken who shall declare his generation that word generation all me means also means habitation who shall declare his habitation where is his dwelling place psalms 132 13 says for the lord hath chosen zion zion the bride for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation oh he he's talking about you now somebody just realized he's talking about you for the lord of chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation this is my rest forever here will i dwell for i have desired it oh when isaiah spoke and said a virgin shall conceive i want you to know that there was a predestinated betting ground for that word she hadn't even come on the scene yet but the word had been spoken and it was going to go falling through time for about 800 years and then until there came one that would believe it hallelujah and there the angel come and said fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus mary was living prophecy now i'm trying to bring this to a certain direction here now she was living prophecy think about that calling now the prophet spoke it yes mary believed it and the word was made flesh all right now i'm about to read a quote the prophet's going to speak it the bride is going to believe it this is out of pick up your pen and write he he puts this in the spoken word as the original seed and you'll also find it in the church book he says the law of reproduction brings forth of its kind genesis 1 11. these last days true church bride oh i don't mean to stop but this is the other side of the prophecy i sure enjoyed that this morning this is the other side of the prophecy this is the part of the prophecy for you the law of reproduction brings fourth of its kind genesis 1 11 these last days true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super church a super race as they near their great headstone they will be so much like him they will be in his very image in order to be united with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god he goes on to say nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again amen now i got a great big hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord i want to say the prophet spoke it do you believe it then the word is now becoming flesh in you oh it was a process for mary she didn't say i believe it was like [Music] no but there was a process she believed upon the word and she conceived in her womb and you have believed upon the word and you have conceived in your spiritual room and now that word that the prophet has spoken is becoming flesh in you amen oh i loving questions and answers they asked brother branham will the bride have a ministry before the rapture so maybe you want to ask the question do i have a ministry oh the prophet says yes sir she does it's it's comprised of prophets uh evangelists apostles teachers pastors he says she has a great ministry it's the message of the hour oh if you can believe it it's your message and it's your ministry because without you it can't be made flesh somebody got to declare him i say oh lord let me declare you oh i love how the mighty god available for us he says now god is behind your skin that's right we'll try to move towards a close here whereby are given unto us exceeding second peter 1 4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust oh look there's an escape from all this nonsense out there from all this lust and nonsense that's out there in the world we've received a divine promise there is an escape from that all this lady will see a nonsense and and all the knowledge and education and increased with goods oh they think they're good but they're blind wretched miserable naked and don't even know it but we've been given precious promises to be a partaker of his divine nature amen just as mary was living under a promise abraham and sarah were living under a divine promise look in in in genesis 12 just out of the blue god comes to abraham and gives them a promise says i'm going to make you a mighty nation i'm gonna your your seat will be numbered as the stars and as the sands of the sea he's going along like man i don't see nothing happening but but there in the plains of memory when melchizedek come he come there to abraham and oh we know the story how he discerned the thoughts of of sarah's heart and he gave the prophecy he gave the promise and he said according to the time of life you shall have a son look abraham was living under divine promise promise he was living under divine prophecy i want you to know i this is a type here you are living under divine prophecy that will never fail so here abraham he met melchizedek god made flesh come down and told them according to the time of life you shall have a son and now abraham he's going on about his business believing the process in the process of this prophecy being fulfilled can you imagine abraham made a bad decision he thought he'd slip on down to philistine country and he goes in there and here this young king goes man that's a beautiful woman and so we know the story abraham tells sarah to lie tell him you're not my husband you'll kill me i mean i'll work this whole promise thing with god out later i we we can ourselves we can't bring the word of god to pass it's a divine promise it's an unconditional covenant it's his life in you both willing to do and to perform his word oh i thank you lord if it's up to me i just mess it up every single time oh but god reaching mercy he loves you so much he just says son it's okay i'll work everything out for your good you can't fail not even death can harm you why because you're living under divine promise so that the lord appears to this young king and say hey man you're a dead man what are you talking what do you mean you know my heart you know the integrity of mario goes that woman that you want to marry that's another man's wife and he said restore back that man's wife i want to read a quote restoration of the bride tree there you are god's word it has to stand no man could touch sarah god had made a promise hallelujah sarah a type of the church the true church the free church the free woman with the free child type of the born again church with promise let them say whatever they want to call it holy roller fanaticism they've tried to stop it since pentecost they'll never do it no sir just keep your hands off it that's all god's going to take that and do something with it just as certain as i'm standing here that ain't just to the people under the sound of his voice in 1962 oh no no when god says something it's not in a in a realm that's bound by time he speaks from eternity oh hallelujah you can't escape god just as sure as i'm standing here we're coming right down through the age of it in a few minutes god help me i'll prove it to you where we're at they're never going to destroy it it can't be destroyed that's right take your hands off her why there come the natural seed the natural seed had to come if sarah would have married this other man the natural seed would have never been born so if god so protected the course of the natural seed how much more for the spiritual royal seed has he protected satan give them back turn them loose you're not smothering them out there in them organizations and things they're free people you let them alone turn them loose that's good talking now now i want to ask you what are you struggling with what have you been going through think about your family members you think go ahead and think about your son you go ahead and think about your daughter everything that you've ever loved and everything that you've holded dear go ahead and put it on your heart because god is speaking saying satan give them back turn them loose you're not smothering them out there in them organizations and things there are free people oh satan you can't have her satan you can't have him why oh you're already predestinated you're already healed i die for you i paid the price for you i redeemed you oh hallelujah oh think of it i redeemed redeeming me probably come up higher john come up here let me show you things to come and there john oh let me preach for a little bit church there john was caught up there and he said oh immediately i was in the spirit and there was one that sat upon the throne with a little book in his hand and him to look upon he was like sardis said it was like jasper and there was a rainbow above us around his head and he said there coming a mighty angel saying who is worthy to open the book we're talking about redemption now i redeemed you your name was in that book who is worthy to open the book and loose the seven seals thereof and john he's looking he's looking in heaven he's looking down in earth he can't see nobody worthy no no no one there is worthy oh but he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and all of a sudden here comes one and the angel says weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed to take the book and in the first seal the prophet says john turning he saw a lamb coming out it must have been bloody and cut and wounded it had been slain a lamb that had been slain and it was still bloody if you had cut the lamb and killed it the way that the lamb was anyhow it was hacked to pieces on a cross spears in his side and nails in his hands and feet and thorn over his brow he was in an awful condition and this lamb had come forth and went over to him that sat upon the throne that held the complete title deed of redemption and the lamb goes and takes the book out of the hand of him that sat upon the throne and was to look and took and open the seals and open the book then when that happened we found out there must have been something great something took place in heaven for the elders the 24 elders and the beasts and everything in heaven began to cry worthy and here come the angels and poured out the vials of the prayers of the saints the saints under the altar screamed out worthy art the lamb for you have redeemed us and now you have made us kings and priests and we shall rule on the earth oh my and that soul when he opened the book you see the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world i've been about 55 minutes here we'll close shortly he says the book actually was planned and written before the foundation of the world this book the bible was really written before the foundational word in christ being the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and the members of his bride their names were put in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world but it's been sealed up and now it's being revealed whose names are there and all about it now we're familiar with these scriptures amos 3 7 now it's being revealed and whose names and what's all about it surely god does nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his servants the prophets we know the word always comes to the prophet brother branham gives us the type just how john john was a manifestation there of isaiah 40 a voice of one crying in the wilderness saying the messiah is coming he was there to prepare the way and there he is speaking behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world the prophet says that the word came to john while he was in the water because the word has to come to the prophet and brother brandon makes this peculiar statement if you will he says and when he did he said it now changed from the prophet to the prophecy let me say it in other words like this the voice of the sign is vindicated by the manifestation of what was spoken brother branham taught that he said a prophet is vindicated by the manifestation of the word by what he spoke coming to pass so here john says behold the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world and here came the word to the prophet now we've heard that illustration think of a city sign you know you're coming back from louisiana and you see a sign that says you know it says a terrell dallas fort worth well it says dallas is in 80 miles well if you go 80 miles and dallas ain't there then the voice of the sign was wrong but when you when you look at the sign and it points you in a certain direction and when you get there you see the city then you know you have now come to the manifestation of what the voice of the sign was coming to and so if i could say it like this with john he was saying he's coming he's coming but then it changed to he is here it changed from he is coming oh hallelujah to his what was that third pull what was the opening of those seven seals come on church let me just say what the prophet said here out of the breach he says oh hallelujah now but this book a mysterious book it's a book of redemption now we know this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood it's probed at through six church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all of the loose ends that these other fellows probed at and the mysteries comes down from god as the word of god and reveals the entire revelation of remember your name was in that book that's being revealed the entire revelation of god which you were part of then the godhead and everything else is settled all of the mysteries serpent seed and whatever more it's to be revealed i'm not just making that up it's thus saith the lord i'll read it to you out of the book at the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seven church age the last church age all the loose ends and those things the church ages have been probed at we'll be wound up together we're moving right to a close quickly and when the seals are broke and the mysteries is revealed down comes the angel the messenger christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming just as john was given his message that same time that the messiah come in those days john knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him and we realized that in the scriptures over in malachi 4 there's to be one like john an elijah to whom the word of the god can come to and he is to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of god and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers restore back all these mysteries that's been probed at through all these denominational years now that's what the word says i'm just responsible for what it says it's written that's right that's what it is now we'll end on this right here it says now we see that seven seal book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from god now all the mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger now here's the angel on earth and another angel mighty messenger come down see this angel was an earthly angel messenger but here comes one down from heaven well we're the revelation of those seven seals the prophet said those seals were christ he said here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covenancy only christ it could be o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken o fools and slaw of heart to believe all that was spoken the prophet said he never come right out to those uh uh disciples on the road to emmaus and said now i'm the messiah i'm the one that's resurrected from the dead the prophet said he just took him back to the scripture hallelujah he just took him back to the scripture and said as it was in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man he said as it was written in malachi 4 the musicians would come oh what did he do he just took us back to the scripture he didn't have to explain it he never came out right there and said it but something in the believer sees it he said i will restore saith the lord the same son that rose in the east the same son that rose and breathed on the disciples and said receive you the holy ghost and he was a morphe into a bride body that was declaring themselves the prophet said that jesus received a bride fresh at pentecost but it fell and the prophet says the same son that rose in the east he says oh now there's come a time of doom and gloom we've gone through the church ages but the same son that rose in the east has risen in the west at the evening time it shall be light and what was he doing god the fullness of the word has now been restored and god is in morphe he's changing his mask now and he's now living in the bride and she's declaring that he's the same yesterday today and forever if you could play something lightly as we all stand the prophet said the same s-o-n that poured himself out kinos kenosis on the day of pentecost promised to do the same thing in the evening time oh it is the rising of the sun this is our jubilee throw down your home you're free church turn them loose satan you can't have her whatever you've been battling whatever you've been going through the word of the lord says satan you turned him loose there's something you need deliverance from don't wait another moment you reach out by faith and say amen the word has been spoken you're living under divine promise you're living under divine prophecy and that word is going to be fulfilled in you god changing his mask you're the other side of the prophecy amen let's just sing this jesus be the jesus christ [Music] oh [Music] me jesus i surrender all [Music] you feel that you have a need or something in your heart you just want to lift up to the lord you know there's more of god for you to have and you feel prayer with hell we just want to approach the lord lord jesus we just approach you now as we've tried to deliver a little burden that you placed upon our heart lord when we look into the vastness of your word and how rich it is lord we stand in all many times we feel like the prophet there standing in your glory feeling so unworthy but you took the coal of fire and you touched his lips and he said here i am lord send me lord many times we feel so unworthy we look at ourselves and we maybe look at the past lord but we thank you lord that you're the kinsman redeemer that came and paid the price for sin lord and you just didn't leave it there two thousand years ago but you were building to achieve something you had a great plan in mind a great climatic a nail-biting moment as our brother spoke about here in the end time in satan's eden that you would achieve a bride that would manifest this spoken word that you've given lord we feel that we fall short so many times sometimes we maybe feel like abraham we ran off to maybe a country and made a decision we should have made lord we're just looking to you that you just help us to get right back into the channel lord help us to turn away from the things of the world and have have one eye a single eye just for you lord as our pastor talked about may we not wink at the things of the world may we not get caught up on the other side of the uh a prophecy or get stuck in the middle where we're we're looking to and fro lord we want to surrender all to you lord we want to do our part or we want to play our part in the drama we want you to live out your life through us as you have so beautifully spoken we just love you now we commit the people to you lord and just pray that you make up the difference lord where we fall short that your people would be edified and be drawn closer to you we pray we commit all the needs to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen i have a father there's he knows my name he knows he says i am [Music] we know he knows why [Music] you know what makes a promise so real is when you can make it your own you know it it isn't that god's a healer it's when you can say god is my healer it isn't that he's a deliverer that god has delivered this one and god has delivered that one it's when you can say god hath delivered me and that's what we're talking about we're talking about a time that it's not the history that speaks about the fulfillment it's not those that god has delivered it's when we can say god has made it real to me and it's when we can bring it to others and say this promise is here for you and you can eat and you can partake and you can manifest and that's what makes this real that in this last hour there were going to be a people that didn't know it by history they knew it by experience and they could show it by experience and they could talk about a god that doesn't have a history of the things they've done but that i'm a witness that he's done these things and that's why this bride is going to rise up she's going to be a people of experience of people of manifestation and all the promises that were spoken there's somebody that can say i know this has happened i know he's a deliverer i know he's a healer because i am the manifestation and the proof of it and that's what our hearts desire is is that it's not the mental side of it it's the manifestation side of it and if you have part of god's promise living in you then you will manifest it if you have a circumstance in your life a loved one that's not saved someone that's sick someone that needs deliverance this is the hour that we claim the manifestation and the deliverance and the word coming to pass in flesh and you hold that promise there in your life until it comes to pass amen i appreciate that word don't you a church that's going to see the promise fulfilled is that your heart's desire that's your portion church that's what's given to us that's what we have we don't want to be stuck we want to be the fulfillment of the prophecy fulfilled and manifested amen you hold that right before the lord and that's one more time let's approach his throne and you hold your desire before you hold that loved one before you hold that child before him you
