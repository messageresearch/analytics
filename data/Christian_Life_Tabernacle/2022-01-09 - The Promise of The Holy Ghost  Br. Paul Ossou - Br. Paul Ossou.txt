in the name of the lord jesus amen amen as we're still standing let's open our bibles don't leave the roma let's go to the book of romans chapter three chapter eight new zealand romans chapter eight and verse eight uh romans chapter 8 verse 8 to 14 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwelleth in you now if any man have the spirit of christ he is if any man have if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raise it that raise it up christ jesus from the dead dwells in you it will he that raiseth christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are we are debtors not to the flesh but live after the or to live after the flesh for he for if we live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye leave but if ye through the spirit do mortified the deed of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the the sons of god let's go back to the book of acts chapter two it's a very familiar scripture reading acts chapter 2 37-39 um now when they hit when when they're heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostle men and brethren what shall we do then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and is unto you and and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as our lord god shall call father may you bless it in the name of the lord jesus amen amen [Music] i wanted to thank with all my heart by the don't set opportunity the opportunity is giving me he will see uh and all the help that is brought on my way for me to my family and i thank every brother every sister roberta bailey [Music] if i had something better to say in return what to do in return i was going to do it just as well but all i could say tonight may the lord bless you richly each one of you and when you will be in prayer when you have done uh said all that you wanted to say to the lord [Music] and that you don't have anything more to say pray for me i need your prayers in your countries to choose may the lord lead me in all things that he may always give me his grace [Music] tonight uh based on the scriptures that we just read if you went to chile texas [Music] i would like to title this little exhortation that i'm going to bring forth la promise the promise of the holy ghost i don't know bringing it out of acts chapter 2 verse 39. this morning it was a great blessing [Music] that to have the key to access the supernatural but could you know that play have you done this god has called us to live in the supernatural view god wants that every day of our lives that we may be in the supernatural remember for the shows and sometimes things that seems easy for us we know that god is behind it that the supernatural is behind it and and for those that have access so that knows a little bit about science regardless of all the noises that the scientific world makes two circuits of fair all that they know to do said explique como is to explain how the thing is working capable but they are all incapable to say who is causing that thing to work the way it's working they will tell you that the earth is turning around the sun it's going to take 24 hours it's going to take 365 days but who tells the earth to go around the sun the way it goes they are incapable of telling you that even with you upon the level they will tell you that in the winter time that life in the tree will go down to the roots and then during the the the springtime it will start to come back like you don't learn delicious i'll accept the disorder but who gives the intelligence to life in the tree to go into the roots so even what we see in the natural yeah there is a supernatural that's causing it god is in everything that's why god is wanting us to be in that supernatural it was wonderful this morning and tonight i'm just going to try to just uh uh uh uh to bring a little more on a long video to going for uh forward with the promise of the holy ghost because we know it's god in the beginning who created all things it's god who used the form of the word in order to create all things manifested in the old testimony he came and he was manifested as god above us it was god the father he let that you would have to be careful otherwise you were going to die but this guard who was above us he found out that on the form that he was in a he he couldn't bring us into the stature or in the nature that we should have had but a lot of other people because man had lost his possession the position that god placed him when he placed him in the garden of eden that's why that same god he changed the form it was a god who was uh uh severe in his judgment he became emmanuel god with us we were able to touch him he knew that protester he brought us his grace la bibica don't set the form in the bible it says that in this form he wanted to reconcile the world to god he came as the uh uh the uh link between to bring together man and god mesut he didn't accomplish all that he wanted for us he didn't accomplish the the the final product that god wanted for us that's why in the end of his mission when we look in john chapter 14 chapter 14 verse 14 it says if ye ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandment and i will pray and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever you those that are in in a trinity it is the voila women it says now look this is he himself yes jesus that he's going to pray to the father so that the father may send the holy ghost that means there's three people and jesus neither know him no neither knoweth him know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you and now hear what they say i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you so it's no longer the spirit that the father will send but he himself is saying i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you also then jesus is making the promise the same way that god changed the form of pain he left his position of fatherhood so he could become the son of god the problem of the problem with people conception of the jews they don't have the conception of god and as we heard it this morning it's not by our intellect but it's by revelation that's why jesus could say it's like us as men as human having a child a local let's show that definition in fact the things of god they have their own definition in the word of god the bible says in isaiah that god will give you a sign what's the university yeah uh virgin shall conceived will have a son and it shall be his name shall be emmanuel which means god with us that was the word of god the fifth of jesus the son of god means god with us god inaudible the same god who changed the form yeah who became the son of god but not that he formed the future but in a form of the son of god and he himself said that he couldn't help us in remaining in that form that he had to go from this sentence that he may come back in the form of the holy ghost so they can dwell in us and to lead us in all things when we look at the ephesians chapter one the bible says uh even even even as you are called in one hope of your calling in your ancestor one lord insult for one faith and soul but one baptism six as a jew one god and father of all ki who is above all we can say god the father and through all jealousy god the son emmanuel and inaudible the holy ghost the son of jesus one god ki who's the father who's above all who had the form of god the father above us who's among us through us god emmanuel the son of god and in all the holy ghost and when god promised this is when he resurrected he said to the disciples go and wait in jerusalem you will when this promise came to pass piers he knew that in the book of joel god promised something when people thought that they were drunken he says they are not drunk as he supports that this is the promise that god promised in the book of jokes that in the last day i will pour out my spirit upon our flesh your young men will have visions they talk to peter and other disciples oh brothers what shall we do and that's when peter said repent because that every one of you may be baptized in the name of the lord jesus for the for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost he said this promise is for you circulated those that were in front of him and for your children and for all those that are far off and as many as our lord our lord god shall call then like that's how we're coming to that promise it's a promise that was made unto us yeah it defects second it was made to each and every one of us a certain promise and this promise but the condos have only because when we read roman jesus romans chapter 10 that if we don't have the spirit of god we are not of god that all of those that have the spirit of god they are called the sons of god so for us to really be the children of god in order for us to have access to the supernatural exhaustion and for us to know that god is hearing our prayers we have to access to this that's when we have the supernatural in our lives that's when we are sure that god is hearing our prayers that the baptism of the holy ghost the holy countdown paragraph 37 if a man sets if a man sets on the thought that of justification is all that we have to have don't leave her is wrong don't leave her wrong he's got to be wrong hello and then if your church who believes like the many of the pentecostals please say sir the holy ghost is it that's all just repent and get the holy ghost that's your fault that's still wrong about because you've got to get sanctification in there to cleanse it before the holy ghost can come in synovial just create a song if you don't you leave out the blood [Music] as people talk to the baptist talk that the baptism of the holy ghost is the new birth now that's wrong the bottom of the sentence please the baptism of the holy ghost is different from the new birth the new birth is when you are born again but the holy ghost is when the power comes into that birth for service set exactly that's it that's that's exactly yellow sentence see the holy ghost said but he said the sentence is baptized in the holy ghost for the new birth you have the new birth in believing in the lord jesus by having faith in accepting him as your savior that's birthday now if you want to back that up see uh take sent john uh five and twenty four he's got the life because he believes mr mummy and that same group had to go to pentecost to be baptized with the holy ghost amen so when people talk about you got to be born again and applying that to the holy ghost many of the metadata and so forth are wrong there it cannot be a just won't cope through the scripture here you get the things sideways it's got to be it's got to take it the way the scriptures got to it's got it placed out here see the holy ghost is ah you shall receive the new birth after this what after this holy ghost has come upon you see and they and they had already believed to eternal life and so forth sentence but they had to have the holy ghost for power you shall be witnesses unto me after the holy ghost has come upon you basically because the holy ghost is the witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in christ so this promise is very important to us that diplomatic sentence this promise of holy of the holy spirit is important to us the baptism of the holy ghost is something of great importance in our walk every day because this baptism of the holy ghost it means we don't have that god coming and dwelling in us it means we're walking by ourselves we are certainly on the road we so he can lead us in all the things that we are doing because he said when the holy ghost shall come he will guide us in all truth and righteousness it will show us things to come that's why this promise is important the reason is we see god here send the holy ghost the absolute is for one purpose god genuinely that god himself which i believe don't say that he may dwell in his church and continue his works through the church what god was in christ he was following the same work through christ and from christ he came into the church he'll possess enough a traveling to continue the same work in the church and the placenta is a journey so the holy spirit is god himself who comes to establish himself in us to continue his works to keep to to put us on the on the worst concept to put us into service to introduce us into the supernatural conjunction because when god who's supernatural says and why was the holy spirit given paragraph 94 it says that's the purpose of the holy ghost that's what god sent the holy ghost for the sentence the holy ghost came to give us to give you power i got some scriptures here just a minute the holy ghost came can't come to give us power to give you power give you intellectually we can read the word who is explaining how things work my and this promise is for it's for it's for each and every one of us no one is excluded from this promise don't appear you take you that to give you power in prayer in person it says you take a person that's live a good life but but but they are always defeated oh i tell you i'm [Music] they never get a prayer answered uniform you filled that little woman with the holy ghost one time watch it says watch what take what takes place can't tell what they want you when she goes before god and above she is not defeated she comes boldly to the throne of god believing see he's got the holy ghost it gives you power your life is full of power it will dandela it gives you power in speech it is a paragraph 10103 i was talking of power of power of prayer i was talking on power of prayer the power of speech and power of holy life amen amen voila that's what the holy ghost is to do the sentence you this word that's the key to the supernatural parallel it's the word that's bringing us into the supernatural sentence the holy ghost gives us power in the word and the power of holy life what the enemy tries to do is to make us weak in prayer you know doctors tell him he he keeps us occupied so much during the day and sometimes we come back very tired and when we take account of all the day we haven't even prayed for 10 minutes in 24 hours but the holy ghost god gives us the holy ghost the holy ghost will bring us into prayer the holy ghost will bring us into the presence of god because it's in the presence of god we can have access to all the blessings that god has promised in his word and that's the role of the holy ghost and that's the promise that god has made us peter said this promise unto you for your children for those that are far off honesty and as many as our lord our god shall come and that's why it's important to each and every one of us to realize the importance of the holy ghost in our lives it means when you don't have the holy ghost you'll say oh but when i'm shameless i love the lord i want to leave the world but i'm always defeated but when the holy ghost is in you when god himself comes to establish himself in you you will live from victory unto victory let's all stand per second this promise is in for all of us the holy ghost is ours and god promised us the holy ghost to give us the power in the word so that we may not live by the flesh as paul is speaking uh spoken in the book of romans but we may live powerless by the holy ghost by god himself he comes to establish himself in us to continue his work it's very important that we claim that promise that every one of us is every sentence when we are baptized with the holy ghost we are sure we are on the road and says he's going to go he's going to come to rapture only those that have the holy ghost and we know that we're all trying our best to be there on that day but tonight so that you don't miss that day you don't listen the holy ghost is something of great meaning for us it introduces into the supernatural let's pray god had a beloved father we know the importance of the holy ghost we know that it's you coming to dwell in us that's why we claim it for each and every one of us we claim it for each brother and its sister we claim it for each and every child oh come true as you promised lord controversy when you said in the book of job you did it in on the day of penalties you said that that promise was ours jesus i pray that each and every one of their children that will come closer to you those that have repented with all their hearts those that have been baptized in the name of the lord jesus you said good cause your life when that is done it's you that gives the baptism of the holy ghost may you fulfill your word father don't let that to be one among us he as we commit ourselves back into your hands bless once again this church the pastor in the name of the lord jesus amen amen aren't you glad there's the gift of the holy ghost you know i think i was thinking of just going through my mind of the different brothers in the church and and i i watched as they accepted the lord and they believed in the lord you know what i mean and they knew this message was right and they just and yet they they were dealing with cigarettes or they were dealing with uh alcohol you know what i mean and they just they just sat there i talked to one brother one time you could tell i love the lord you know pack of cigarettes in his pocket and a whole truck bed full of beer cans and everything one day he got the holy ghost amen he got the supernatural that made the difference and answered the cry of your heart so never give up because there's something that god has that for you amen if you have your bibles as the brothers who go prepare for communion let's turn over into the book of mark in the 14th chapter and we'll start reading so i just think that's you know the spirit of god that gift is the difference in what we can do and what god can do and it certainly is that's just beautiful and then we'll turn in st john the 14th i mean mark excuse me the 14th chapter and the 12 the 12th verse and we just read the communion story according to mark it says and it says in the first day of the unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou may eateth the passover and he sent them forth two of his disciples and said unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the good man of the house the master saith where is thy guest chamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples and he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us isn't that the supernatural and then that isn't that what we've seen displayed in our day amen same spirit and his disciples went forth and came unto the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover and in the evening he cometh with the twelve and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me and they begin to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish and the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and break it and giveth to them and say take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it anew in the kingdom of god and when they had sung a hymn they went out unto the mount of olives amen amen you brother let us all bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father lord we are brought to remembrance of the evening that you ate your passover with your disciples and you break bread and you blessed it and you gave it unto them and you said it was your body lord in that you took the cup and you blessed it and you drank it and you said do this in remembrance of me as often as he did our gracious father we are so thankful for communion lord and as the scripture said you went forth that evening to the mount of olives where you were taken captive and then crucified for our sake that in the great crucifixion our sins which were many were forgiven and the price of our sins was laid upon you and you born to dark calvary by your stripes lord we were healed and father with that great hope we have communion tonight remembering the love and the sacrifice that you so gave yourself on our behalf as our brother preached tonight father that we can come to you and that we can receive of you your spirit that by this spirit we have power to overcome although we have communion tonight with your word and your spirit because your word is spirit and it is true lord and we are so grateful that we can have fellowship knowing that you yourself are here present with us to for every petition that we have on our heart that you may fulfill it father receive our communion tonight as we bless this bread in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ and we rest this cup of this wine in the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen foreign once again [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] my [Music] oh [Music] amen isn't the word of god wonderful you know there's so many things that you can derive from god's word you know jesus saying there he says is one of the twelve it just kind of broadens to our heart that there must have been more than just the twelve there you know we think so many times from what history has said that there was only 12 people there but he sent two of his disciples it didn't mean it was two of the twelve and then the scripture said he came with the 12. so you know when you begin to understand that this was a a beautiful body of believers there people that had been healed and and you think maybe the woman at the well was there and and i i take all the people the the young boy that was blind that sat there and questioned the pharisees one of my favorite parts of the scripture you saying that you're the fathers of israel and you don't know by what spirit you're healed i think that's one of the greatest commentaries in the scripture of this young person sitting there explaining and the scripture says they threw them out and then jesus went and found them and he followed him can you just imagine in your mind who is there taking communion uh blind bartimaeus i believe he was there and i just go through the scriptures what a can you imagine the testimonies in that room that night as they all sat there and had supper with the lord amen let's turn over in our bibles to the gospel of of saint john and let us stand as we read in the 13th chapter and it says now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved him to the end and supper being ended the devil having now put it into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he raiseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girdeth himself and after that he had poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh heat to simon peter and peter said unto him lord dost thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knoweth not now but thou shalt know hereafter and peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet pretty strong huh jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hath no part with me simon peter said unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not saved to watch his feet but is clean every wit ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen there's one sure way to be happy according to god's word and that's when it wash one another's feet god bless you our sisters go and we'll come back [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] you
