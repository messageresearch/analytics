[37:36] [Music]
[37:41] let's pray our gracious father
[37:44] truly you are all that we have needed
[37:48] father we need a greater revelation of
[37:51] that a greater understanding
[37:54] father as
[37:57] we know that you
[38:00] are the great shepherd and you
[38:02] look after your sheep
[38:05] you leadeth them
[38:07] father and
[38:08] guide them
[38:09] and that's what we asked tonight father
[38:11] that you'd speak to us and lead us and
[38:14] guide us and
[38:16] open our understanding and give us a
[38:19] clear vision
[38:20] and rest in peace
[38:22] we ask these things this evening
[38:25] because we've come to worship you and
[38:27] hear from you
[38:29] father we just asked again that you
[38:31] would bless every need of the people in
[38:35] jesus name we pray amen
[38:38] amen if you have your bibles let's open
[38:40] up to
[38:43] the
[38:44] gospel of
[38:48] saint john
[38:49] the 11th chapter
[38:52] and we just want to read
[38:55] a verse here
[38:58] and
[38:59] it says of course
[39:02] in the 24th verse of john
[39:05] 11 this is
[39:09] martha's response
[39:12] and to jesus
[39:14] and
[39:18] and
[39:19] jesus said unto her thy brother shall
[39:21] rise again and martha said unto him i
[39:24] know
[39:25] that he shall rise again in the
[39:27] resurrection at the last day
[39:31] jesus said unto her i am
[39:34] the resurrection and the life
[39:37] he that believeth in me
[39:40] though he were dead yet shall he live
[39:44] and whosoever
[39:46] liveth
[39:47] and believeth in me
[39:49] shall never die
[39:51] believeth without this
[39:54] amen may the lord add his blessing to
[39:56] the word you may be seated
[40:07] tonight
[40:08] we are going to continue our little
[40:11] study
[40:12] going forward out of
[40:16] the message the rising of the sun
[40:19] and so we're going to listen to another
[40:21] 20 minutes
[40:23] but i'd like to approach this in
[40:27] a a way of thinking you know
[40:30] you can always go back and listen to
[40:32] this message over and over again is just
[40:35] wonderful
[40:37] but i thought of a little uh
[40:40] a
[40:41] part of
[40:43] the approach
[40:44] to this is
[40:46] brother ben makes this statement he says
[40:48] i'm sure this morning
[40:50] that even we who believe it
[40:53] cannot comprehend what a great thing
[40:57] that was
[40:58] because he raised from dead
[41:01] and we also raised from the dead
[41:04] we
[41:05] for we were in him
[41:08] and i'd like to just
[41:10] approach this little portion if you
[41:13] could
[41:14] uh
[41:15] get your mindset
[41:17] in this way
[41:20] and i call call it the reading of
[41:24] the benefits
[41:26] now
[41:27] normally when you
[41:29] have a reading of
[41:31] a will
[41:33] or of the benefits it's because somebody
[41:36] has passed on
[41:38] and therefore you become the beneficiary
[41:43] or someone who receives the benefits or
[41:47] receive something
[41:49] and increase to improve your life or
[41:52] something something that's
[41:54] handed down
[41:56] for the purpose of keeping things going
[42:00] like they might uh you know keep the
[42:03] blessings to the family going maybe they
[42:05] pass down a house or they pass down a
[42:08] car it's just kind of a way of keeping
[42:12] things going but those benefits only
[42:15] come
[42:16] after
[42:17] death
[42:18] our benefits are just the opposite they
[42:22] come after life
[42:24] so these are not death benefits if you
[42:28] have an insurance policy
[42:30] that you have
[42:32] benefits and a life insurance policy but
[42:35] it's not really a life insurance policy
[42:37] it's a death
[42:38] benefit
[42:40] policy
[42:42] so the benefits come at the end of life
[42:45] but this
[42:46] benefits came at the beginning of life
[42:51] so they're they're not
[42:53] they're they're not hand-me-down
[42:55] benefits
[42:57] they're not benefits that are only for a
[43:00] uh
[43:02] a
[43:03] period of time
[43:04] maybe just the time that
[43:07] you have left
[43:09] and they're dispersed but but these are
[43:12] eternal benefits right
[43:15] and so it makes it
[43:17] it makes it so
[43:19] a wonderful so
[43:20] uh
[43:22] and he
[43:23] and we're gonna listen so we're gonna
[43:25] talk a little bit this time not after we
[43:27] listen but point out a few things before
[43:30] we listen
[43:31] and i know that that the message will
[43:34] speak to each one of you but as we
[43:37] listen to this
[43:39] we want to understand
[43:42] the whole concept
[43:44] of
[43:45] what he did
[43:48] gave us something
[43:50] that there's something there for us to
[43:53] receive
[43:55] there's benefits
[43:57] and that that's what we don't want to
[43:59] miss
[44:00] it's not an acknowledgement
[44:03] of an event
[44:04] or it's not an acknowledgement of
[44:07] something that he did
[44:10] is not sitting back and saying oh he
[44:13] rose from
[44:15] the dead
[44:16] and that's what he said that the
[44:19] that when he broke that easter seal or
[44:22] death what death did it it sealed us
[44:25] away when you think of death that
[44:28] person's life is over there they're
[44:30] sealed everything what they have done is
[44:34] is finished at that time
[44:37] and so you look at it like it puts a
[44:40] seal
[44:41] on it and there's that person's life
[44:45] it's been sealed up by death it's over
[44:48] every his record now is sealed
[44:53] and
[44:54] and there's there's no more to be
[44:56] written
[44:58] right
[44:58] no more to be done
[45:00] and then he gives his benefits down but
[45:04] this seal
[45:06] it it
[45:07] it
[45:08] broke something
[45:10] that
[45:11] nobody ever saw everybody watched people
[45:14] go down and watch their lives be over
[45:16] and watch their lives be over and
[45:19] because their life was over
[45:22] the only benefit they
[45:24] could give you
[45:26] is what was left over
[45:29] from their life
[45:33] you know and
[45:34] and it's like uh
[45:36] those of us that are older like now that
[45:40] you know i i have things and at 72 years
[45:44] old you get to the place i'm sure some
[45:47] of you are heading there
[45:48] i don't see many of you but
[45:50] but
[45:51] you don't want no more stuff
[45:55] you know and so now you know my mother
[45:58] she'll be hundred years old
[46:00] i think the 25th of july she'll be 100 i
[46:03] believe
[46:04] and
[46:06] and we're kind of wondering well
[46:10] who wants this and who wants that i
[46:12] don't want any of it
[46:14] i'm not like a boat pitcher
[46:18] you know but i don't need any more stuff
[46:21] you know what i mean so it'll just it'll
[46:23] just go down but it's
[46:26] if you understand that this seal what
[46:29] death has always been it's been the end
[46:32] of that person's story
[46:36] okay that their story's over it's been
[46:38] that way for everybody for all time if
[46:42] it's been that the story's been written
[46:44] and what things they have their
[46:46] inheritance is passed out amongst the
[46:49] the kids and the grandkids and
[46:52] it's all spread out and then that life
[46:55] is sealed away
[46:56] but because this seal
[46:59] was not the end of life it was the start
[47:02] of life
[47:03] and so the seal was
[47:06] broken
[47:07] and he said and
[47:09] and we'll read it i'd just like to read
[47:11] it
[47:13] to us
[47:14] he said
[47:15] now he said
[47:17] so he says now the true easter seal
[47:21] on this sunrise was broken
[47:24] and the secret of life after death
[47:28] was revealed
[47:31] so good that so now
[47:34] when he broke the seal of death
[47:37] now we knew
[47:39] that there was life after death
[47:43] so he proved that there was life after
[47:45] death
[47:47] the secret
[47:49] of that there is life after death
[47:53] but
[47:56] we could know the fact
[47:58] that there's life after death but that's
[48:01] not
[48:02] what we're looking for we want to look
[48:04] for the benefits what who's the
[48:07] beneficiary because the seal was broken
[48:10] now there's benefits from it
[48:13] and that's what we want to look as we re
[48:16] listen to this next 20 minutes it's like
[48:19] the prophet's
[48:20] reading
[48:22] the benefits
[48:24] of the
[48:25] breaking
[48:26] of the easter seal
[48:29] because this seal is broken
[48:32] there's benefits to you there's benefits
[48:35] to you this is what'll happen
[48:37] because after one of the benefits you'll
[48:40] listen to them say was that every
[48:42] predestinated seed would come to life
[48:46] what a benefit
[48:48] in other words it's not going to pass
[48:50] you by
[48:52] and then again he makes this statement
[48:55] he said so he's talking about as we pick
[48:58] it up he'll be talking about this seal
[49:00] he says so we now he knew
[49:03] we knew that the secret of life after
[49:06] death is there because here's a man that
[49:09] lived as we did and died as we do
[49:12] and now he's alive
[49:15] and he goes on to say so he says he said
[49:19] when he come forth on that morning
[49:21] because i live you live also not only
[49:25] was he the beneficiary
[49:28] of the resurrection but all those seeds
[49:31] that was resting in god's great promise
[49:35] was the benefactors of the resurrection
[49:39] so that's what we want to listen to this
[49:41] evening what
[49:43] are my
[49:45] personal
[49:46] benefits
[49:50] from jesus raising from the dead
[49:56] now if if it's in the natural you have
[50:01] to be written in the will
[50:03] well this is what he's going to point
[50:05] out here you were written
[50:08] in the benefits
[50:10] of the resurrection
[50:12] your name was there
[50:15] so you're a ben you're a benefit
[50:17] a beneficiary so you can lay claim
[50:21] to what's yours
[50:23] that's right
[50:24] and i i am
[50:26] and so we're going to listen but so
[50:29] so we understand now that we're there
[50:32] there
[50:33] were benefits he says because ye live
[50:37] because i live you shall
[50:41] live also
[50:43] that was the breaking of the seal
[50:48] that was the breaking not just that
[50:51] there's life after death
[50:54] that's like a fact
[50:56] but the breaking of the seal was because
[50:59] i live
[51:01] you live also
[51:02] so if you really believe that he's risen
[51:05] and he really is then you can understand
[51:08] because he lives
[51:10] i am going to live also
[51:15] we're not waiting
[51:16] that's right and worrying
[51:18] that's right
[51:21] we're already sitting
[51:23] in heavenly places
[51:25] in christ jesus
[51:27] and then he so we're he'll talk about
[51:30] this benefit and and then who the
[51:33] beneficiaries are
[51:34] the ones who's predestinated the ones
[51:37] whose names written on the lamb's book
[51:38] of life
[51:40] and we you need to sit back and go
[51:41] that's me
[51:42] that's me
[51:44] i'm there
[51:45] that's who i am he revealed to me that
[51:48] my name's in there so if he's revealed
[51:50] to you that your name's on the lamb's
[51:52] book of life then you're entitled
[51:56] to know
[51:57] what your benefits are
[52:00] so he's we're just talking about
[52:03] the benefits and this little section
[52:06] and it goes on and that and so he says
[52:12] and he'll make this statement and you'll
[52:13] hear it he says
[52:15] he come to redeem
[52:17] or bring to life
[52:20] those predestinated seed that god seen
[52:23] before the foundation of the world
[52:25] and put their names on the book of life
[52:30] so that's who's that's
[52:33] who is in the beneficiary policy of not
[52:37] death
[52:39] but of life
[52:41] and and he goes he says
[52:43] and
[52:44] here they are on earth without hope
[52:48] and he come not only to be a blessing
[52:52] but to share the blessing with every
[52:56] predestinated seed
[52:59] okay so now that's the benefits he's
[53:02] going to share the benefits
[53:05] what what what did he benefit
[53:09] by rising what was the benefits because
[53:12] i live
[53:13] you live also so
[53:15] as we listen to this i think of it kind
[53:18] of like of the seal being opened what we
[53:21] might consider in the natural is
[53:24] is the will being open but it's not the
[53:27] will of death
[53:29] this is the will of life
[53:32] so these aren't death benefits these are
[53:36] life benefits
[53:38] and he says to share with every
[53:41] predestinated seed now if the seed
[53:43] wasn't on the earth it could not live it
[53:46] had to be on earth
[53:48] and also germatized no matter how long
[53:51] it is kept in darkness
[53:53] it
[53:54] comes forth when the s-o-n shines upon
[53:57] it notice now he come to share it with
[54:03] us
[54:06] so there's something he wants to share
[54:08] yes sir you know so he's telling us guys
[54:12] this is like kind of a prelude you know
[54:14] he's reading it open to us now it's
[54:16] going to start opening to us the
[54:18] benefits of the
[54:21] of the will of life
[54:25] the will of life
[54:27] i like that
[54:29] the
[54:29] beneficiaries of life
[54:32] and then we'll talk he'll talk a little
[54:34] bit
[54:35] about how
[54:36] that you receive
[54:38] uh those benefits
[54:41] he and he says here
[54:43] this is
[54:44] you'll notice it on paragraph
[54:46] ac60
[54:54] he says
[54:56] now the very essence of the message
[54:59] that was sent
[55:00] that he is risen from the dead
[55:04] we his beneficiaries who share
[55:08] the resurrection with him
[55:12] draw
[55:13] benefits from this
[55:16] so we draw benefits from what he did but
[55:20] now how do you go about drawing the
[55:24] benefits how do you get the benefits
[55:29] so he's going to tell you they're there
[55:33] but how do you get them
[55:35] how do i tap in
[55:37] to get these benefits
[55:39] and i i thought this was a marvelous
[55:41] little secret
[55:43] as he'll share it with us he'll say
[55:47] he says we also share
[55:49] resurrection with him draw
[55:52] benefits from this
[55:54] by proving
[55:56] to
[55:57] the world that he
[56:00] is alive
[56:04] we can
[56:06] cannot do it
[56:08] by word only
[56:10] we cannot do it by some tradition of man
[56:14] we only reflect exactly what we're
[56:18] pointing to
[56:20] so that that's how you draw it's not by
[56:23] word it's by proving
[56:27] that he's alive is how that you draw the
[56:30] benefits by proving to the world that he
[56:34] he's he's alive that's how we draw
[56:38] from these benefits is it
[56:41] they are proving his life uh
[56:44] in us now and that's what i thought just
[56:47] thought that was uh just a tremendous
[56:50] thing and so there are just a few things
[56:53] to look at it as
[56:55] as you we listen to this next 20 minutes
[56:59] take it personal
[57:01] this is not
[57:03] a
[57:04] recorded sermon
[57:07] of brother branham that is something
[57:10] that he talked about long ago
[57:12] once you understand the revelation of
[57:15] the storehouse
[57:17] that this was laid up
[57:21] for you personally
[57:24] for a certain time
[57:27] we we understand that right
[57:29] many times people have
[57:32] uh
[57:32] trust funds and they have
[57:34] uh
[57:35] inheritances and they'll say this person
[57:38] can't receive it until they become 18.
[57:42] it's laying there all the time right but
[57:45] there's a time frame in which this
[57:48] benefit is going to come forth
[57:52] how does god distribute
[57:56] his benefits
[57:59] by revelation amen
[58:02] by revealing to you
[58:05] that this benefit is now
[58:08] available to you
[58:13] so
[58:14] it's it's different in just
[58:19] reading
[58:20] uh reading the benefits
[58:25] and
[58:26] and
[58:27] and
[58:28] just
[58:30] saying that they're there but what's
[58:32] different is when it's revealed to you
[58:36] that now is your time to take possession
[58:41] of that benefit
[58:43] yes sir that's right
[58:45] so that's why healing you can read about
[58:48] healing
[58:50] and you know that he's a healer
[58:53] and you know that it's written in there
[58:55] and you believe it's in there but the
[58:57] difference of it is when it's revealed
[59:00] to you that you know it's a benefit
[59:03] because you believe god's a healer but
[59:05] now you he reveals to you it's time for
[59:08] you to take possession of the benefit
[59:12] and prove to the world
[59:15] that he's alive
[59:19] amen
[59:20] and it it
[59:21] changes because
[59:23] the we all know the thinking of man has
[59:26] gone mad
[59:30] and and so he gave us some advice he
[59:34] said let this mind be in you that was in
[59:36] christ
[59:37] so he went to calvary
[59:40] not for himself
[59:43] but for
[59:44] us he didn't nobody took his life from
[59:48] him
[59:49] he laid it down
[59:51] to break the seal to prove to you that
[59:55] there's life after death and because i
[59:58] live you shall live also and not taste
[1:00:01] death
[1:00:03] and all the other benefits that come
[1:00:05] with it so he's going to describe who
[1:00:08] the beneficiaries are
[1:00:10] what the benefits are
[1:00:13] and how that we lay hold
[1:00:16] of the benefits
[1:00:19] and and so when we listen to it
[1:00:23] let's listen to it beyond
[1:00:27] just oh this is one of the sermons and
[1:00:29] we're studying the sermon
[1:00:31] if you could listen to it
[1:00:34] like he is here
[1:00:37] how many knows he's here
[1:00:39] why is he here because i feel him no
[1:00:42] he's here because he promised to be here
[1:00:47] and what does he possess
[1:00:49] he possesses all the benefits
[1:00:52] of
[1:00:53] what a man possesses
[1:00:56] when he's able to overcome death helen
[1:00:59] the great
[1:01:03] what what's the final end of sickness
[1:01:06] death
[1:01:07] so if you can
[1:01:09] overcome
[1:01:11] the final result then you've overcome
[1:01:14] the sickness
[1:01:19] okay and now we're sitting there and
[1:01:21] he's done that
[1:01:23] at the end so we're starting to approach
[1:01:25] okay what's happening this evening
[1:01:29] god sent
[1:01:31] the beneficiary
[1:01:33] reader
[1:01:35] he sent the revealer
[1:01:37] to reveal to everybody whose name is
[1:01:41] written on the lamb's book of life what
[1:01:43] the benefits are of the resurrection
[1:01:47] now those of you who have studied this
[1:01:50] we're stopping
[1:01:52] tonight right before the wave offering
[1:01:56] but you've got to understand the idea
[1:02:00] of showing the benefits
[1:02:02] before you can understand the purpose of
[1:02:06] the wave offering
[1:02:08] so okay i i just hope that you enjoy we
[1:02:11] were going to play 30 minutes but there
[1:02:13] was so much in this 20 minutes
[1:02:16] that i thought let's just take some time
[1:02:19] let's feed on it let's feast on it we're
[1:02:22] believers in this message it's what we
[1:02:25] are
[1:02:26] you know what i mean we're not trying to
[1:02:27] come up with a new spirit we're not
[1:02:29] trying to come up with a new approach we
[1:02:32] are trying to feast
[1:02:36] on the revealed word of god
[1:02:39] this
[1:02:39] by playing this

[1:05:30] and to support this great uh
[1:05:34] fun or drive for the doctors and medical
[1:05:38] science to work upon uh
[1:05:42] something to retire or to help the
[1:05:45] tuberculosis they are sealed what we
[1:05:48] call an easter seal when we send message
[1:05:51] one to another
[1:05:52] but when we receive the message
[1:05:55] that seal is broken
[1:05:58] because the seal is what's got a message
[1:06:01] bound on the inside
[1:06:03] and now
[1:06:04] the true easter seal
[1:06:07] on this sunrise
[1:06:09] was broken
[1:06:10] and the secret of life after death was
[1:06:14] revealed
[1:06:15] before that time we didn't know
[1:06:19] the world
[1:06:21] uh
[1:06:22] grouped in darkness
[1:06:25] groped around
[1:06:26] man
[1:06:27] suspicion
[1:06:29] theories was among man's heart
[1:06:31] traditions
[1:06:33] made up
[1:06:34] man worshiped idols they worshipped the
[1:06:36] son they worshipped all kinds of gods
[1:06:39] and all kinds of people made claims they
[1:06:41] all went into the grave and they stayed
[1:06:44] in the
[1:06:44] grave but the real seal
[1:06:48] had been broken
[1:06:50] and one who once lived as we live
[1:06:53] died as we will die
[1:06:55] was risen from the dead
[1:06:58] what a morning never one like it in all
[1:07:02] the history of the world the secret was
[1:07:04] made known that he was both resurrection
[1:07:08] and alive
[1:07:11] and he said when he come forth on that
[1:07:13] morning because
[1:07:14] i live you live also
[1:07:18] not only was he the beneficiary of the
[1:07:21] resurrection but all those
[1:07:25] seed that was resting in god's great
[1:07:27] promise was a benefactor of that
[1:07:30] resurrection to life because he said
[1:07:33] because i live amen ye shall live also
[1:07:40] that was the breaking of the seal
[1:07:42] because he was brought up so will
[1:07:46] everyone that's in christ be brought up
[1:07:49] with him
[1:07:51] at this glorious sunrise
[1:07:54] god has proven or vindicated his word
[1:07:58] all the glooms and doubt that have
[1:08:01] moved in people's minds
[1:08:03] was taken away
[1:08:05] because here was he who once lived eat
[1:08:08] drink and fellowship with mankind that
[1:08:11] said i have power to lay my life down i
[1:08:14] have power to raise it up again
[1:08:17] and now not only had he made the
[1:08:20] statement but he proved it to be the
[1:08:23] truth
[1:08:25] oh what a glorious thing that is
[1:08:28] i'm sure this morning
[1:08:30] that even we who believe it cannot
[1:08:34] comprehend what a great thing that was
[1:08:39] because he raised from the dead we also
[1:08:44] have already raised from the dead
[1:08:48] while we were in him
[1:08:51] notice
[1:08:52] now
[1:08:53] as the gloom covered the earth and the
[1:08:56] seeds cannot live without the s-u into
[1:08:59] her eyes and plume had covered the earth
[1:09:02] and now the s-o-n was risen and all
[1:09:06] gloom was banished by this light as it
[1:09:08] spread across of the nations to the
[1:09:11] people that he is not here but he has
[1:09:14] risen
[1:09:15] what uh what a statement
[1:09:17] he had proved his word he had proved it
[1:09:21] be to be true
[1:09:23] for he had now
[1:09:25] conquered
[1:09:26] death hell and the grave
[1:09:29] the trinity of the devil
[1:09:32] death hell and the grave
[1:09:35] for satan is the author of death
[1:09:38] he is the possessor of hell
[1:09:42] and also the grave
[1:09:44] and that was the trinity
[1:09:46] of satan being caused by one
[1:09:50] thing that was death death you go up the
[1:09:53] grave and being a sinner you go to hell
[1:09:55] all the very one thing the trinity of
[1:09:58] satan which was death
[1:10:00] that had helped man in captivity all
[1:10:03] these years but now
[1:10:06] the true trinity of god
[1:10:10] being one manifested in christ who was
[1:10:12] life
[1:10:14] and it broke the seals and conquered the
[1:10:16] enemy and rose up the one true and
[1:10:19] living god
[1:10:21] i am he that was dead and i'm alive
[1:10:26] forevermore had the keys of death and
[1:10:29] hell
[1:10:31] god in one
[1:10:33] made man and dwelt among us and
[1:10:35] conquered every enemy
[1:10:38] and it proved
[1:10:40] that the trinity of satan was conquered
[1:10:42] and at the trinity of god was made known
[1:10:45] because only god alone had power to
[1:10:47] bring life back again
[1:10:49] he was that emmanuel
[1:10:53] god
[1:10:55] had been manifested in the flesh no
[1:10:58] wonder he could claim there matthew the
[1:11:00] 27th chapter all powers in heaven earth
[1:11:04] is given into my hand
[1:11:06] i send you to be my witnesses to all the
[1:11:09] world
[1:11:10] he had conquered both death hell and the
[1:11:13] grave
[1:11:14] not only did he do that and caught out
[1:11:17] triumph
[1:11:19] with all the power in heavens and earth
[1:11:22] all that was the father all that was the
[1:11:24] holy ghost and all that there ever was
[1:11:27] what's in him
[1:11:28] all powers in heaven and earth is given
[1:11:31] unto me
[1:11:33] everything else is powerless
[1:11:36] he had conquered it
[1:11:38] now and
[1:11:41] then not only that
[1:11:42] he sent word to his disciples just
[1:11:45] believing fear not
[1:11:47] for i am he
[1:11:50] that was dead
[1:11:51] and is alive again forevermore
[1:11:55] i have the keys
[1:11:57] to step in hell
[1:11:59] i've already conquered it don't fear
[1:12:03] anymore for every
[1:12:05] for our deen predestinated seed of god
[1:12:09] shall come to life when that light
[1:12:11] spreads across the earth of the glorious
[1:12:13] gospel in every age it'll bring forth
[1:12:15] the crop that god ordained to do
[1:12:18] he is raised from the dead
[1:12:22] oh what a wonderful thing that is
[1:12:27] i am alive or quickened the word means
[1:12:31] the word quicken the greek word means
[1:12:34] that something that's made alive after
[1:12:36] death like the the seed that goes into
[1:12:39] the earth it has to die every bit of the
[1:12:42] seed
[1:12:44] it has to rock every bit of the seed
[1:12:48] and every bit of the life that was in
[1:12:50] the seat has to come forth again
[1:12:56] he was quickened
[1:12:58] not only that
[1:13:00] and will send
[1:13:01] the same life that quickened me the
[1:13:04] power that brought me from the grave
[1:13:08] i will send it upon you
[1:13:11] to quicken you
[1:13:12] that where i am
[1:13:14] there ye will be also
[1:13:18] in luke 24 chapter
[1:13:20] 49 first he said behold i send the
[1:13:23] promise of the father upon you
[1:13:25] but terry are waiting in the city of
[1:13:29] jerusalem
[1:13:31] until you be endued with power from ohio
[1:13:36] to show that not only did he draw all
[1:13:38] the benefits out of it but he shared
[1:13:42] those benefits
[1:13:44] he come to redeem or to bring to life
[1:13:48] those predestinated seed that god came
[1:13:51] before the foundation of the world and
[1:13:54] put their names in the book of life and
[1:13:56] here they are on the earth without a
[1:13:58] hope
[1:13:59] he came not only to be the blessing but
[1:14:02] to share the blessing
[1:14:04] with every predestinated thief
[1:14:07] now
[1:14:08] if the seed wasn't on the earth it could
[1:14:11] not live
[1:14:12] it had to be on the earth and also
[1:14:14] dramatized
[1:14:15] no matter how long it's kept in darkness
[1:14:18] it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines
[1:14:20] upon it
[1:14:22] notice
[1:14:23] now
[1:14:24] he come to share it with us
[1:14:26] no wonder the gospel is good news
[1:14:30] the very word gospel means the good news
[1:14:34] the good news was
[1:14:36] if a man died
[1:14:38] for our sake
[1:14:39] that's good news
[1:14:41] if christ was born that's good news
[1:14:44] but never a news
[1:14:47] never was there news
[1:14:49] like this news
[1:14:51] that he who made the promise has
[1:14:53] confirmed the promise
[1:14:56] and he's alive forevermore
[1:14:59] and had the keys to both death and hell
[1:15:02] in his hands
[1:15:04] all the gloom was shook away
[1:15:07] there was no more gloom to be seen for
[1:15:09] the sun was up from the grave
[1:15:12] there was no
[1:15:14] oh he will come or he may come he had
[1:15:17] already come
[1:15:19] the gospel good news
[1:15:21] notice the very message of the gospel
[1:15:24] itself is to prove
[1:15:27] to the people
[1:15:29] that he is risen
[1:15:32] go tell my disciples
[1:15:35] that i am risen from the dead
[1:15:38] and i'll meet with them to confirm this
[1:15:42] to them
[1:15:44] oh god
[1:15:46] how in this last days there shall be
[1:15:49] light again across here
[1:15:52] i'll prove to my disciples
[1:15:55] don't tell them that i am not dead and
[1:15:58] i'm not a tradition but i am a living
[1:16:01] christ
[1:16:02] amen
[1:16:05] i'll meet them
[1:16:06] take this message to my
[1:16:09] disciples
[1:16:10] that i'm risen from the dead
[1:16:13] the gospel good news you say is that
[1:16:15] right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[1:16:17] yesterday today and forever
[1:16:21] we as beneficiaries
[1:16:22] are to prove his life
[1:16:25] is in us now
[1:16:28] the beneficiaries of
[1:16:30] this life the life he never was a life
[1:16:33] lived like it
[1:16:34] he was the son of god
[1:16:36] and he died
[1:16:39] and that shut it out
[1:16:40] but when he raised again from the dead
[1:16:44] on easter morning
[1:16:45] then
[1:16:47] we as his servants are commissioned by
[1:16:50] him to go into all the world
[1:16:54] and to bring this good news
[1:16:57] to every person
[1:16:59] that he is a living
[1:17:02] and how can we do it by
[1:17:05] word only
[1:17:07] or it is written the gospel can not by
[1:17:09] word only but through the power and the
[1:17:12] manifestation of the holy spirit to
[1:17:15] prove that he is alive
[1:17:19] lord
[1:17:20] now if there is another gospel that paul
[1:17:23] spoke to one of the groups i am so
[1:17:26] surprised that you turn to another
[1:17:28] gospel which is the weather
[1:17:30] but a make-believe gospel
[1:17:33] to a denominational
[1:17:36] fiction
[1:17:38] turning from
[1:17:40] that good news
[1:17:43] and because
[1:17:44] i live
[1:17:46] you live also
[1:17:48] and i live in you
[1:17:51] and the works that i do john 14 12
[1:17:55] the works that i do will identify
[1:17:59] myself in you
[1:18:02] what a message
[1:18:04] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[1:18:06] theology
[1:18:08] but in the evening time there shall come
[1:18:11] light again
[1:18:12] there will be a resurrection
[1:18:15] in the evening time
[1:18:18] it shall be life
[1:18:20] at the evening time
[1:18:22] now
[1:18:24] the very
[1:18:25] essence of the message
[1:18:27] that was sent
[1:18:29] that he is risen
[1:18:32] from the dead
[1:18:34] we has been a fisher
[1:18:36] we who share the resurrection with him
[1:18:39] draw benefits from this by proving to
[1:18:42] the world that he is alive we cannot do
[1:18:46] it by word only we cannot do it for some
[1:18:48] traditional man we only reflect exactly
[1:18:52] what we're pointing to i'm afraid today
[1:18:56] that too many of us are not getting
[1:18:58] people to christ
[1:18:59] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:19:01] theory
[1:19:03] but we must get them to christ he is the
[1:19:06] only one and the only one that has life
[1:19:10] he that has a son has life
[1:19:13] and if the life of a man is dead
[1:19:16] be projected in you
[1:19:18] you will live the same life he is
[1:19:22] if the blood
[1:19:24] of a man
[1:19:25] was a certain type
[1:19:27] you took the blood from one man and
[1:19:29] changed the blood of one man into
[1:19:31] another he'd absolutely be that tight
[1:19:33] blood
[1:19:35] and if your spirit
[1:19:37] that's in you is reconciled
[1:19:40] and you are anointed with the life that
[1:19:43] was in christ is upon you
[1:19:45] romans 8 11 says
[1:19:47] if the spirit that raised christ from
[1:19:51] the dead dwells in you it will also
[1:19:54] quicken your mortal body
[1:19:58] that same life
[1:20:00] then pain powers
[1:20:02] then same beneficiaries
[1:20:04] that he had your own earth from god he
[1:20:07] redeemed you
[1:20:10] a seed that was forward known by god
[1:20:13] whose names was put on the lamb's book
[1:20:15] of life before the foundation of the
[1:20:16] world and that gospel light of the
[1:20:19] resurrection the confirmation of the
[1:20:21] word
[1:20:22] how did we know he was a crisis
[1:20:25] because he proves what he talks about
[1:20:28] how i know the message of the hour
[1:20:31] god proves what he promised that he
[1:20:33] talks about
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:36] that is the identification
[1:20:39] that we are of beneficiaries with him in
[1:20:41] the resurrection
[1:20:43] he proves what he's talked about what he
[1:20:46] promised to do in christ he proved on
[1:20:48] the resurrection
[1:20:50] what he promised to do in the days of
[1:20:51] moses he proved him
[1:20:53] what he promised in the days of enoch he
[1:20:55] proved it
[1:20:57] in all the days of the proposal
[1:21:02] he proves what he said because they are
[1:21:05] a part of that seed that was represented
[1:21:09] on the book of life that he came to
[1:21:11] redeem back to god again
[1:21:15] oh
[1:21:16] what a message
[1:21:18] a easter morning not only did he raise
[1:21:22] but his beneficiaries raised with him
[1:21:27] they were in christ at his crucifixion
[1:21:30] they were ending at his resurrection
[1:21:32] we are of his beneficiaries
[1:21:34] quicken after being dead in darkness in
[1:21:37] a darkened world of unbelief
[1:21:39] or churches and denominations and so
[1:21:42] forth have brought us out and there's
[1:21:44] something in us calling old we want god
[1:21:46] we're hundred and thirsty for god we
[1:21:48] joined the methodist baptist
[1:21:50] pentecostals presbyterians what more
[1:21:52] still there was something wrong
[1:21:55] we just couldn't find it yet
[1:21:57] and all others couldn't while we was
[1:21:59] groping in darkness a great resurrection
[1:22:03] came to us
[1:22:04] in the manifestation of the promised
[1:22:06] word of god like he was the
[1:22:09] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:22:11] god
[1:22:13] i will not leave his soul in hell
[1:22:15] neither will i suffer my holy one to see
[1:22:17] corruption amen he manifested in every
[1:22:21] word of god that was promised to him he
[1:22:23] proved it when he raised on the easter
[1:22:26] morning
[1:22:28] ah
[1:22:28] them who were once groping in darkness
[1:22:32] and wandering around if they should wash
[1:22:34] feet on this day or if they should keep
[1:22:36] a certain day or do a certain set of
[1:22:38] rules all those things passed away
[1:22:41] well that was a glorious resurrection
[1:22:44] that defied every man-made thing that
[1:22:46] man had ever done
[1:22:48] every man-made reason
[1:22:50] there had never been to that time a man
[1:22:52] that could lay his life down and pick it
[1:22:54] up again
[1:22:55] he defied that scientific proof they had
[1:22:58] by raising again
[1:23:00] when they say that jesus christ is
[1:23:02] deceit yesterday forever that his power
[1:23:05] isn't the same that his gospel isn't the
[1:23:07] same when the bible says it's the same
[1:23:10] god's desire for denomination ever
[1:23:12] creeds and he moves forward with his
[1:23:14] holy spirit as he promised has proved it
[1:23:17] to us
[1:23:18] that he is alive
[1:23:21] we are the benefactors
[1:23:24] of his resurrection
[1:23:26] quicken after being dead in the world
[1:23:29] and sin and trespasses he is quickened
[1:23:31] us together with him raised with him now
[1:23:35] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:23:37] jesus
[1:23:39] his brain is spirit brings his same life
[1:23:42] again on the earth
[1:23:44] if the spirit of god
[1:23:47] that raised up christ the body
[1:23:49] the anointed bloody if the spirit of god
[1:23:52] anointed that body
[1:23:54] in such a way
[1:23:55] that when that seed fell into the earth
[1:23:58] he just wouldn't let him rest there
[1:24:00] no no
[1:24:01] he quickly raised him up
[1:24:04] that same spirit by the same works by
[1:24:08] the same power by the same signs being
[1:24:11] you
[1:24:12] he'll also raise you up
[1:24:21] okay so did you you see who the
[1:24:24] beneficiaries were
[1:24:26] did you see there was benefits so now
[1:24:29] you can start to see
[1:24:31] what that he's
[1:24:33] telling the people is that
[1:24:36] all these benefits of the resurrection
[1:24:39] have been hid from us
[1:24:46] by traditions of man and dogmas and
[1:24:50] false teachings and
[1:24:52] organizations and all these things and
[1:24:55] now so there's something that is coming
[1:25:00] to
[1:25:01] restore back
[1:25:03] the benefits
[1:25:04] now
[1:25:05] listen this
[1:25:06] this statement
[1:25:08] i i just thought
[1:25:10] that we take this statement
[1:25:13] and he said i will not see my holy one
[1:25:16] see corruption
[1:25:18] but
[1:25:19] when you start looking at in the context
[1:25:21] he's saying
[1:25:22] like he was the manifestation
[1:25:26] of the promised word of god i will not
[1:25:29] leave his soul in hell
[1:25:31] neither will i suffer my holy one to
[1:25:34] seek corruption
[1:25:36] he manifested it every word of god that
[1:25:39] was promised to him he proved it when he
[1:25:42] raised on easter morning so
[1:25:45] if he proved that
[1:25:47] right and he just got saying one of our
[1:25:51] benefits is
[1:25:53] that we were in him
[1:25:55] he will not leave you
[1:25:59] in hell
[1:26:03] you will not be eternal separated from
[1:26:05] god
[1:26:06] you will not be in the grave so now he
[1:26:09] says it he says that
[1:26:11] if you believeth in me you shall never
[1:26:13] die
[1:26:14] well now our messenger comes by and he
[1:26:17] gives us a vision
[1:26:19] of beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:26:22] sees all those saints living
[1:26:27] not falling
[1:26:29] not in darkness
[1:26:31] but alive
[1:26:34] now
[1:26:37] if
[1:26:38] and i i i don't want to jump ahead
[1:26:40] but
[1:26:42] he's talking he's starting to talk about
[1:26:44] this beneficiary power the works that i
[1:26:47] do you should how that's been hid from
[1:26:49] us
[1:26:50] how that's the benefit how that that
[1:26:53] life's in us
[1:26:55] he proved it
[1:26:58] well we are
[1:27:03] by his see exceedingly
[1:27:06] great and precious promises
[1:27:08] we are partakers of
[1:27:11] divine nature
[1:27:12] so he sends somebody
[1:27:16] who is a sinner just like we were
[1:27:20] comes out
[1:27:21] and feasts on the true word of god
[1:27:25] and manifest back to us
[1:27:29] that same life that was in christ the
[1:27:32] same resurrection
[1:27:34] and he's revealing it to us so he can
[1:27:38] prove to us
[1:27:40] that those benefits of the resurrection
[1:27:44] are still here for us to lay hold on
[1:27:51] we're not looking back
[1:27:54] we're looking forward
[1:27:59] we've just got to get to the place
[1:28:01] where we understand
[1:28:04] that this is a restoration message
[1:28:11] it isn't the
[1:28:12] malachi is not
[1:28:15] fulfilled
[1:28:17] until the faith
[1:28:20] of the fathers is in you
[1:28:26] do you understand that's what proves it
[1:28:29] you can't say oh brother branham came
[1:28:31] and fulfilled malachi 4 5 no brother
[1:28:34] branham is the prophet of malachi 4 5.
[1:28:37] you are the fulfillment of it
[1:28:42] you are the word made flesh
[1:28:46] and that's what he's talking about
[1:28:48] he said everything that was promised of
[1:28:51] me
[1:28:51] got proved
[1:28:53] right
[1:28:55] so
[1:28:56] if everything that was promised of him
[1:28:59] was proved
[1:29:01] everything that was promised of jesus
[1:29:03] was proved
[1:29:05] then everything that was promised of you
[1:29:08] has to be proved also
[1:29:13] right we could just jump right into
[1:29:15] proving his word how he predestinates
[1:29:17] the believer there to prove that his
[1:29:19] word is true
[1:29:21] oh i just think it's a thrilling
[1:29:25] so he's opening to us
[1:29:28] the benef
[1:29:32] beneficiary package
[1:29:34] of everything that was in the
[1:29:38] resurrection
[1:29:40] and
[1:29:41] showing us
[1:29:43] is still alive
[1:29:44] and still real
[1:29:46] and still there for you and you can have
[1:29:49] it
[1:29:50] and now we just got to start
[1:29:53] building that up so i thought he alluded
[1:29:56] to in here very beautifully how he tied
[1:30:00] the commission
[1:30:02] of going in to all the world
[1:30:05] and preaching the gospel
[1:30:08] is what ignites
[1:30:12] if i could say that or stimulates
[1:30:15] the benefits that are in you
[1:30:18] yes sir
[1:30:20] so if you lay dormant
[1:30:24] then
[1:30:26] you don't
[1:30:28] you don't partake
[1:30:30] of those benefits
[1:30:32] but when you carry out the commission
[1:30:34] it automatically stimulates that life in
[1:30:38] you
[1:30:39] and brings it there because he's going
[1:30:41] to prove
[1:30:43] what you're testifying
[1:30:45] to
[1:30:46] is true so
[1:30:49] we'll just
[1:30:50] leave it there
[1:30:51] tonight and now the words that we're
[1:30:54] saying this is because now you can look
[1:30:57] forward to these meetings
[1:31:00] and know that
[1:31:02] the resurrected word
[1:31:06] by his spirit
[1:31:07] using human flesh not the man
[1:31:11] but that god can use that to speak to
[1:31:14] you
[1:31:15] and to stimulate
[1:31:17] and revelate
[1:31:20] what benefits that you have
[1:31:23] that you can draw from
[1:31:26] maybe you're a nervous person
[1:31:28] maybe you're depressed maybe you're
[1:31:30] uncertain
[1:31:31] maybe you wish that certain things were
[1:31:34] different in your life and certain
[1:31:36] people in your life were different and
[1:31:39] and uh you don't understand why things
[1:31:42] have transpired the way they've
[1:31:44] transpired you have all kinds of
[1:31:46] uncertainties the word of god can
[1:31:49] address all those feelings
[1:31:53] all those questions
[1:31:57] he can do exceedingly and abundantly of
[1:32:00] what you can even ask or think it's not
[1:32:02] just coming in like i've got this in
[1:32:04] mind and i've got this in mind and i'm
[1:32:07] listening for this
[1:32:10] oh no just listen
