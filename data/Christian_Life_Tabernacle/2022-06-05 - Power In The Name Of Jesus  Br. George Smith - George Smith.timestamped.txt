[37:14] we thank you lord that we have the
[37:15] liberty thus far to
[37:17] worship the god of our conscience the
[37:20] god of heaven and lord as we break this
[37:24] small portion of your word we pray that
[37:25] you would bless it to each heart
[37:27] mage person that's present take a
[37:30] portion home
[37:32] help us lord as we get our hearts and
[37:34] minds ready for the communion service
[37:37] help us now we ask in jesus name amen
[37:40] amen you may be seated
[37:43] it's a privilege to be back
[37:48] and i don't take it lightly that the
[37:50] brother
[37:51] david would give me the privilege to
[37:53] speak to you again
[37:55] it's um
[37:56] it's a privilege
[37:58] tonight we're going to
[37:59] consider a small portion of the word
[38:02] that
[38:03] we've heard before
[38:04] i don't bring anything new we don't have
[38:06] any shortcuts
[38:08] we just have the word
[38:10] and so i want you to open your bibles to
[38:12] chapter two of the book of acts
[38:15] and we're gonna go over this again to
[38:18] see what we might have missed the first
[38:20] time
[38:22] because it's our church this is where it
[38:24] started we're part of that same crowd
[38:26] back there
[38:27] were
[38:28] in this century they were back there in
[38:30] the first century chapter 2 verse 1 and
[38:34] when the day of pentecost was fully come
[38:36] they were all with one accord one place
[38:40] and suddenly there came a sound from
[38:42] heaven as a rushing mighty wind
[38:45] and it filled all the house where they
[38:47] were sitting
[38:48] and there appeared unto them
[38:50] cloven tongues
[38:51] like as fire
[38:52] and it sat upon each one of them
[38:55] and they were all filled with the holy
[38:56] ghost
[38:57] and began to speak with other tongues as
[38:59] the spirit gave them utterance
[39:03] now this is day 10
[39:05] of their
[39:07] sojourning here in the upper room
[39:09] and
[39:10] the 120 that were there
[39:13] we're in prayer they're together they're
[39:15] in agreement they're seeking for the
[39:17] fulfillment of the promise of chapter 1
[39:19] and verse 8.
[39:21] you shall be my witnesses
[39:23] it's going to go to all the world and so
[39:25] forth
[39:27] and it says
[39:28] noise from heaven filled the house
[39:31] tongues of fire appeared on each one and
[39:33] each one was filled with the holy ghost
[39:35] when christ gave him this promise go
[39:37] over there and stay until
[39:39] you have it he didn't give him a
[39:41] colorful picture now this and this and
[39:43] this and this is going to happen
[39:44] just wait you'll know when it happens
[39:46] you know
[39:48] and so the church of jesus christ was
[39:50] launched at jerusalem
[39:52] before that it was just jesus you know
[39:54] praying and and teaching but the church
[39:57] was launched at jerusalem that was the
[39:59] alpha church we are the omega church
[40:03] now this is uh basic and don't be
[40:05] thinking that you know it all just pay
[40:06] attention might be something you didn't
[40:08] know
[40:10] through seven
[40:11] ages two thousand years
[40:13] we've been restored back now to the
[40:15] original by a prophetic message
[40:18] straight from god according to the
[40:20] prophecy of malachi 4.
[40:22] and verse 5
[40:24] from every nation
[40:26] now that's very interesting
[40:28] they were dwelling in jerusalem jews
[40:30] devout men
[40:32] out of every nation under heaven
[40:35] this bible is full of details all you
[40:37] got to do is read it carefully
[40:39] so god's timing is always perfect
[40:43] you don't have to worry
[40:44] he's always on time
[40:47] and i'm sure if we was to take the rest
[40:48] of the night we could start over here
[40:50] and go right through and have
[40:51] testimonies and how god has fulfilled
[40:54] his word and it was always on time
[40:58] so
[40:59] they were gathered in jerusalem
[41:01] from every nation under heaven for the
[41:03] feast of pentecost okay
[41:07] in scripture in leviticus 23
[41:09] god dealing with the chosen people he
[41:11] instituted seven special feasts now
[41:15] that's not just a supper that's you know
[41:17] several days
[41:18] and um
[41:20] in these seven feasts or celebrations it
[41:23] was throughout the calendar year but on
[41:25] three of the of the seven occasions
[41:28] um
[41:30] all the believing men
[41:33] of the congregation
[41:35] in these countries were required to
[41:37] travel to jerusalem to the temple for
[41:39] this feast okay that was one of their
[41:43] things that they had to deal with exodus
[41:45] 23 14-19
[41:47] feast of the harvest or the feast of
[41:48] pentecost was a celebration of six days
[41:51] okay so these people traveled they
[41:53] didn't have airplanes they didn't have
[41:55] mercedes they walked or they had animals
[41:59] so they get there
[42:01] in time for the six days
[42:03] and that's why all these people were
[42:05] gathered in jerusalem at that time okay
[42:08] it was exactly during this same week
[42:12] that the spirit descended on 120. so god
[42:14] had this arranged for that to coincide
[42:17] you see he there's no mistakes
[42:20] god isn't the kind like like uh you know
[42:22] brother david these people out here this
[42:24] pile of dirt well let's see if this
[42:25] works and let's try this no he knows
[42:27] exactly what's going to work you know
[42:29] he knows
[42:30] like the guys in the sound booth let's
[42:32] let's see if this works no god knows
[42:34] what he's doing
[42:36] so he's got all these people gathered in
[42:37] town
[42:38] got 120
[42:40] you know they're up there hiding
[42:42] and when the holy ghost comes on them
[42:45] he allows them to start speaking
[42:47] in languages that all these people would
[42:49] understand
[42:51] look at verse six now when this was
[42:52] noised abroad the multitude came
[42:54] together were confounded because every
[42:56] man heard them speak in his own language
[42:59] now what you got to understand
[43:02] these people
[43:04] worship god in hebrew language the same
[43:08] hebrew language they're speaking today
[43:10] written and so forth so they had the
[43:12] language of the church which was hebrew
[43:14] and that was you know the same
[43:16] everywhere but then they were from these
[43:19] other countries and as you can see here
[43:21] at least 16 countries
[43:23] they spoke that language too
[43:25] and here's these hicks from galilee
[43:28] that's what they were they were just you
[43:29] know country people
[43:32] and they come out of there you know
[43:34] speaking in that other language not not
[43:36] the hebrew that everybody knew that
[43:38] wouldn't be a mystery but they're
[43:40] speaking the other language so these
[43:41] people are at least bilingual maybe
[43:42] three
[43:44] and they're speaking that language but
[43:46] in the accent of galilee
[43:50] so verse 8
[43:52] let's say here
[43:54] how here we every man in our own tongue
[43:57] when we were born because they've been
[43:58] over there for years these these are
[44:00] people that know that language over
[44:02] there
[44:02] and so hey aren't these guys from
[44:04] galilee hicks unlearned you know there
[44:08] could be as many as 16 different
[44:09] languages this is exactly the opposite
[44:12] of what happened at the tower of babel
[44:14] in genesis 11
[44:16] where there was confusion versus perfect
[44:18] understanding
[44:19] only god can do something like that i
[44:22] can't engineer that you know
[44:24] so while peter had their attention
[44:26] verse 14
[44:28] but peter standing up with the eleven
[44:30] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[44:34] now how do you think he did that he
[44:36] didn't have a microphone like this
[44:39] somehow
[44:40] god projected his voice to all those
[44:42] people we're talking thousands
[44:46] you know and they didn't have a nice
[44:47] building they're outside probably uh and
[44:51] he said to them ye man of judea and all
[44:53] you that dwell at jerusalem be it known
[44:54] this day unto you
[44:56] and hearken to my words and he launches
[44:58] into his first sermon
[45:00] could have been 30 minutes i don't know
[45:04] he ends up over here in verse 36
[45:06] therefore let all the house of israel
[45:08] know assuredly you know without a doubt
[45:10] that god hath made that same jesus whom
[45:14] you guys crucified
[45:16] he made him
[45:17] both lord and christ
[45:19] okay he was led entirely by the holy
[45:21] spirit to speak what he spoke
[45:23] he did not beat them into submission as
[45:24] we've you know seen in other meetings
[45:27] he simply was faithful to the truth
[45:30] that they had just experienced for three
[45:32] and a half years
[45:34] and now the master's gone and never been
[45:36] up there for ten days and
[45:38] boom it happens you know
[45:40] he did not call for an immediate
[45:41] response but verse 37 of chapter two
[45:45] now when these people heard this
[45:47] they were pricked in their heart they
[45:48] were disturbed
[45:50] and they said to peter and the other
[45:51] apostles men and brethren what shall we
[45:53] do
[45:54] in other words we we know what you said
[45:56] is true we believe what you said now how
[45:58] can we be a part of this great
[46:00] revelation that god has given you what
[46:02] can we do about this
[46:03] and that's when he offered them the
[46:05] eternal prescription verse 38.
[46:09] now this isn't years later this is just
[46:11] a few days after jesus spoke to him in
[46:13] matthew 28 19. i want you all to go out
[46:15] there
[46:17] make disciples
[46:18] baptizing them in the name of the father
[46:20] and of the son and the holy ghost in red
[46:22] letters a few days later
[46:25] first chance he's got before the public
[46:28] peter said repent
[46:30] and be baptized every one of you in the
[46:32] name of jesus christ for the remission
[46:33] of sins
[46:34] and
[46:35] what you shall receive the gift of the
[46:37] holy ghost
[46:39] for the promise is unto you
[46:41] to your children
[46:42] and those and those and those as many as
[46:44] the lord our god shall call
[46:47] this does not subtract or contradict
[46:50] from the commission of a few days before
[46:54] rather it's a fulfillment or
[46:55] manifestation
[46:57] the revelation
[46:58] of the spoken word fair enough
[47:01] so in verse 41 the small band
[47:04] then they they gladly received his word
[47:07] were baptized
[47:08] in the same day they were added unto
[47:10] them about 3 000 souls
[47:14] now when i get to heaven
[47:16] look for me i'll be there
[47:19] i'll probably look a little different
[47:20] see today me and the pastor and the
[47:22] songwriter all have the same haircut but
[47:24] it's going to be different over there
[47:30] and so
[47:31] um one of my first questions i want to
[47:34] find peter peter come here
[47:37] where did you baptize 3 000 people
[47:41] there's no river and there's no lake
[47:44] so explain that to me but
[47:46] that'll probably be out of my memory by
[47:48] then
[47:50] so here we have three 000 souls added at
[47:52] the first gospel meeting
[47:54] because god was in charge
[47:56] it's a very simple formula ministry
[47:59] speaks
[48:00] god does the work
[48:02] see i might see something here that's so
[48:04] real to me i can only speak it god has
[48:06] put it in your heart
[48:08] billy graham said i have found that when
[48:10] the gospel of jesus christ is presented
[48:12] with authority quoting from the very
[48:14] word of god he then takes that message
[48:17] and drives it supernaturally into the
[48:18] human heart
[48:20] brother branham says preaching is god's
[48:22] program like we said this morning so we
[48:24] preach honestly
[48:26] god does the work in the human heart
[48:29] so you might not be gifted like peter
[48:31] and these people you know you might not
[48:33] have that kind of gift but your life is
[48:35] preaching every waking moment
[48:39] you are a witness
[48:41] you ladies with your dress and your hair
[48:43] you don't have to blah blah blah just
[48:46] walk through walmart you're preaching
[48:49] those that make fun of you
[48:51] they might not go so well those that say
[48:53] god bless you
[48:55] they received it you know
[48:58] so
[48:59] um
[49:00] from verse 42 through 45
[49:02] there was a unity of purpose and
[49:04] fellowship
[49:05] uh that was god's program at that point
[49:08] some have tried that same program today
[49:11] and our prophet said it won't work
[49:14] so this idea of controlling a group of
[49:17] people and let's see let's all eat beef
[49:19] today and that's all you chicken
[49:20] tomorrow and no that doesn't work we're
[49:23] individuals you know
[49:25] and so they had things in common and
[49:28] verse 46
[49:30] they went to church every day
[49:32] and they continuing daily with one
[49:34] accord in the temple and breaking bread
[49:36] from house to house
[49:38] did eat their meat with gladness and
[49:40] singleness of heart
[49:43] okay so they were meeting daily in each
[49:45] other's homes
[49:47] holy ghost fellowship they ate together
[49:49] they remembered the lord
[49:51] now you search and see if you can find
[49:53] it but nowhere in the bible does does it
[49:55] say remember my birth
[49:58] you know christmas and all that no
[50:01] uh luke 22 i believe it is
[50:04] at the last supper and do this in
[50:06] remembrance of me
[50:08] they were remembering his death you see
[50:12] and they were actually having communion
[50:14] every day
[50:15] as often as you do this so forth and
[50:18] that's what we're going to get into in
[50:19] here a little bit
[50:20] in verse 47 and the lord added to the
[50:22] church daily
[50:23] he's always in charge
[50:25] we are only instruments okay
[50:28] ready and willing to be used now
[50:30] instruments
[50:32] you know they have to take a break
[50:33] sometimes
[50:34] sometimes brother david needs to go
[50:35] fishing sometimes i need to go someplace
[50:38] but we're servants brother brahm says
[50:40] i'm just a public servant of god to you
[50:44] the preacher is a public servant we're
[50:46] here to serve
[50:48] now we've got limits of our patience you
[50:50] know
[50:51] but we do try to be nice
[50:55] so we are not managers of god's people
[50:58] the purchase of calvary we're only
[51:00] following these new testament examples
[51:03] because we are bible believers and we've
[51:05] been turned back to the original
[51:08] okay
[51:10] now we're going to look quickly at
[51:12] chapters three and four because this is
[51:14] a six part drama
[51:16] which could be called power in the name
[51:18] of jesus
[51:20] which is jehovah is salvation
[51:23] in
[51:24] act 1
[51:26] uh chapter 3 verses 1-11 it records the
[51:29] healing of the lame man at the gate
[51:31] beautiful okay
[51:32] this is the golden gate now in jerusalem
[51:35] today there's eight gates into the city
[51:38] that's all there was until
[51:41] 1886
[51:42] when they started to people started
[51:44] living outside the city
[51:46] and so today it's a city of 900 000
[51:48] people you know altogether
[51:50] but back then
[51:52] it was walled city
[51:55] and today that eastern gate number eight
[51:57] is sealed
[51:59] because in 1541
[52:01] there was an effort by the non-jews at
[52:03] the time
[52:04] to prevent that messiah from coming into
[52:06] the eastern gate
[52:08] as scripture declares well jesus doesn't
[52:10] need an open gate to get into
[52:13] right
[52:14] okay you remember this morning we had
[52:15] that we had the level over here
[52:18] i'm watching
[52:23] and so
[52:25] this man was sitting at the gate
[52:27] begging for money
[52:29] and peter and john were going up to the
[52:31] temple at the appointed time the ninth
[52:33] hour which would be about
[52:34] 3 p.m in verse 2 of chapter 3
[52:38] and a certain man
[52:40] lame from his mother's womb so he never
[52:42] has walked he is totally incapacitated
[52:46] can't even use a wheelchair no he's they
[52:48] have to carry him
[52:49] they laid him daily at the gate
[52:51] asking for money those that entered and
[52:54] when he saw peter and john about to go
[52:56] in just like everybody else going by he
[52:58] asked for alms
[53:00] and peter
[53:01] fastening his eyes on him very certain
[53:03] sternly
[53:04] look on us
[53:06] and he gave heed okay because he's down
[53:08] here begging okay snooner looks at him
[53:10] and um
[53:11] expecting to receive something of them
[53:13] and what peter say look son silver and
[53:16] gold we don't have we're just poor
[53:17] preachers
[53:18] but what we do have
[53:21] we will give you
[53:22] in the name of jesus of nazareth rise
[53:25] and
[53:26] walk and so the fact is
[53:30] that this man had never walked
[53:32] this is a total miracle amen
[53:35] and um and it draws attention
[53:38] and he took him by the right hand so
[53:40] he didn't just stand there and get up
[53:42] and walk no he reached for him
[53:44] get up and walk
[53:45] and um he lifted him up and immediately
[53:48] his feet and ankle bones received
[53:50] strength
[53:51] now if any of you been in the hospital
[53:52] for a couple weeks you know they gotta
[53:54] perform therapy and get you about
[53:56] walking again it gets you breathing
[53:58] right and all that well he's never
[53:59] walked
[54:00] he's never used any muscles
[54:04] and immediately he's he's ready that's a
[54:06] miracle
[54:08] and so he's we he's a walking leaping
[54:10] praising god and all the people saw him
[54:13] walking and praising god because they've
[54:14] been seen him there for years
[54:17] and they knew that it was he which had
[54:19] been begging for money
[54:20] uh they were filled with wonder and
[54:22] amazement at the thing which had
[54:23] happened and to him
[54:25] so they're very amazed wow what about
[54:28] this you know
[54:30] and so um
[54:31] that's act one act two remember there's
[54:33] how many people tell you five acts
[54:36] now there's six parts to the drama
[54:38] so act two is verse 11. they're greatly
[54:41] wondering so when peter saw that he had
[54:43] their full attention
[54:44] he preached sermon number two
[54:47] and this is just an open street meeting
[54:49] there they've already been into the
[54:51] temple now they're out here you know
[54:52] they're worshiping god
[54:54] and act three is peter's
[54:57] sermon where he identifies jesus as the
[54:59] i am of israel's history he ties it into
[55:02] the see they didn't have a new testament
[55:05] they were they was barely
[55:06] acting it out they had a bible that was
[55:09] a translation 200 years old done in
[55:12] alexandria it was a more
[55:13] friendly uh user-friendly version of
[55:16] scripture
[55:17] in hebrew
[55:18] and so that's what they knew
[55:21] and he's saying hey this is you know
[55:24] this has happened here's the i am this
[55:26] is the christ of i am of history verses
[55:28] 12 through 26.
[55:31] his title could have been covenants will
[55:33] be fulfilled
[55:34] because over in chapter 3
[55:37] uh verse 12 let's see what we've got
[55:39] here verse 12 and when peter saw it he
[55:41] answered the people you men of israel
[55:43] why marvel yet this you know this man's
[55:45] walking or why look you so earnestly on
[55:47] us as though by our own power holiness
[55:49] we'd made this man walk the god of
[55:51] abraham and isaac and jacob the god of
[55:53] our fathers hath glorified his son jesus
[55:56] whom ye delivered up see he never missed
[55:58] a beat
[55:59] you guys are the ones that did it i'm
[56:01] going to remind you every chance i get
[56:02] because y'all did it
[56:04] you all delivered him up and denied him
[56:07] in the presence of pilate when he was
[56:08] determined to let him go but you denied
[56:11] the holy one
[56:12] and the just and desired a murderer to
[56:15] be granted into you
[56:17] so he
[56:18] he was very smart in how he's doing it
[56:21] and you killed the prince of peace whom
[56:22] god hath raised from the dead where we
[56:25] are witnesses
[56:26] and this same in in his name uh through
[56:30] faith in his name hath made this man
[56:33] strong
[56:34] whom you see and know
[56:36] gave the faith
[56:38] which is by him hath given him his
[56:40] perfect soundness
[56:42] in the presence of you all and now
[56:44] brethren i
[56:46] that's a old english word it means i'm
[56:48] sure i walked i am sure that through
[56:51] ignorance you did it as did also your
[56:53] rulers
[56:54] but those things which god hath
[56:57] but those things which god
[56:59] before had showed by the mouth of all
[57:01] his prophets
[57:02] that christ should suffer
[57:04] he hath also he had so fulfilled
[57:07] so that would have been his sermon you
[57:09] know act three
[57:11] and
[57:12] that shows that
[57:13] he goes on
[57:15] to show that there's hope for us in the
[57:16] 21st century he says repent therefore
[57:19] and be converted
[57:21] that your sins may be blotted out
[57:23] when the times are refreshing shall come
[57:25] from the presence of the lord
[57:27] and he that's god
[57:29] shall send jesus christ which before was
[57:32] preached unto you it was just here a few
[57:34] months ago
[57:35] whom the heaven must receive in spanish
[57:37] it says whom he must keep back
[57:39] until the times of restitution of all
[57:41] things which god hath spoken by the
[57:43] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[57:46] world began
[57:48] so we're in the age of restoration we're
[57:50] in the time when all this is being done
[57:52] this restoration is being put together
[57:54] and jesus is coming back
[57:56] it's right there in plain language you
[57:57] know
[57:58] so there is hope for us over here and um
[58:01] when we can repent and get in tune get
[58:03] in balance with god's program you see
[58:06] focus on the larger picture until the
[58:08] time of restitution respond restored
[58:11] back to a former state like you that
[58:13] like to restore cars and furniture
[58:14] you're getting it back everything's
[58:16] going to be just just so that's the way
[58:18] god's restoring his bride it's got to be
[58:20] perfect
[58:22] you young young guys that are looking
[58:24] for a bride you're not looking for
[58:25] somebody missing a hand you want you
[58:27] know 100 well that's what god wants he
[58:29] wants 100 bride
[58:31] so
[58:32] um
[58:33] verse 24
[58:35] of chapter 3
[58:37] yea and all the prophets from samuel
[58:40] and those that follow after as many as
[58:42] have spoken have likewise foretold of
[58:45] these very days
[58:46] you are the children of the prophets and
[58:49] of the covenant which god hath made our
[58:51] fathers saying unto abraham and in nice
[58:54] in thy seed
[58:56] shall all the kindreds of the earth be
[58:57] blessed amen
[59:00] unto you first god having raised up his
[59:02] son jesus sent him to bless you jews
[59:05] israel in turning away every one of you
[59:08] from his iniquities
[59:11] so
[59:12] god is in control of all the activities
[59:15] he's got the whole map already laid out
[59:17] you see
[59:18] and so all we got to do is pay attention
[59:21] and get in step
[59:23] i was in the military if you're not in
[59:25] step they're going to throw you out
[59:26] they're going to make you do something
[59:27] else but you got to get in step you see
[59:29] so act four is chapter 4 1-4 and as he
[59:33] spake unto the people the priests and
[59:34] the captains of the temple
[59:36] which knew their bible should have been
[59:38] happy to see
[59:40] a fulfillment and a blossoming out of
[59:42] scriptures
[59:44] no
[59:45] they came upon them they're upset
[59:48] they're
[59:50] being grieved that they taught the
[59:52] people and preached through jesus the
[59:55] resurrection from the dead see they
[59:56] couldn't handle that resurrection
[59:58] business
[59:58] that's the cornerstone of our whole
[1:00:00] message it's the resurrection
[1:00:02] you know
[1:00:03] and so
[1:00:05] and they laid hands on them and put them
[1:00:07] in the prison until the next day because
[1:00:09] it was already you know sundown
[1:00:11] how be it many of them which heard the
[1:00:13] word believed
[1:00:15] and the number of the men was about five
[1:00:17] thousand so we had three thousand over
[1:00:19] here now we've got another five thousand
[1:00:22] without a microphone
[1:00:24] god is doing things
[1:00:26] the church is you know taking no
[1:00:29] evangelists spend the first night in
[1:00:32] jail for preaching the truth amazing to
[1:00:34] a very large crowd
[1:00:36] verse five and it came to pass on the
[1:00:38] moral that the rulers and elders and
[1:00:40] scribes
[1:00:41] and announced the high priest and all
[1:00:43] these guys
[1:00:44] many of us were kindred and so forth
[1:00:46] they got their whole excuse me the whole
[1:00:48] council together and when they had set
[1:00:50] them and brought the prisoners in
[1:00:52] they asked by what power
[1:00:54] or by what name have you done this
[1:00:56] how did you guys do this magic trick how
[1:00:58] did this happen you know we got to know
[1:01:02] and um
[1:01:04] so
[1:01:05] in his defense
[1:01:06] peter goes through the whole deal we're
[1:01:08] starting at verse 9.
[1:01:10] if we this day are examined
[1:01:12] of the good deed done to the impotent
[1:01:14] man or by what means he's made whole be
[1:01:17] it known unto you all and all the people
[1:01:20] of israel
[1:01:21] that in the name of jesus christ of
[1:01:23] nazareth whom you all crucified here it
[1:01:26] is again
[1:01:27] whom god raised from the dead thank you
[1:01:29] lord
[1:01:30] even by him does this man stand before
[1:01:33] you whole
[1:01:34] so he wasn't promoting himself yeah i'm
[1:01:36] peter i'm the one with the keys and yeah
[1:01:38] i did this and bless god and i need your
[1:01:39] money no that's foolishness
[1:01:42] dallas is full of it
[1:01:45] yeah it goes worldwide
[1:01:47] no jesus
[1:01:49] is the one that did
[1:01:50] this and this is the stone
[1:01:53] which has said it not by you builders
[1:01:55] which has become now the head of the
[1:01:56] corner neither is there salvation in any
[1:01:59] other for there's no other name given
[1:02:02] under heaven by which men whereby they
[1:02:04] must be saved so
[1:02:07] god is definitely in control there's no
[1:02:09] other name
[1:02:10] never in the name of peter the name of
[1:02:12] william branham thank you i got people
[1:02:14] relatives that are in that mess yeah
[1:02:17] it's in the name of jesus christ
[1:02:19] everything else is false galatians 1 8
[1:02:21] is still the truth if you don't preach
[1:02:23] what paul preached you're going to hell
[1:02:24] it's that simple
[1:02:27] so
[1:02:29] act 5 is verses 13 through 22
[1:02:32] peter and john they're warned they've
[1:02:33] been released
[1:02:35] and um
[1:02:36] they um
[1:02:38] yeah they were they spent the night in
[1:02:39] jail
[1:02:40] and so um
[1:02:42] they they preached to him again repent
[1:02:44] their form be converted
[1:02:46] and um yeah we're in chapter four i'm
[1:02:48] sorry verse 13
[1:02:51] and um they when they saw the boldness
[1:02:54] of peter and john these are fishermen
[1:02:57] they knew how to fish how to clean fish
[1:02:59] how to cook fish how to sell fish
[1:03:02] they perceived that they were unlearned
[1:03:04] and ignorant
[1:03:06] but they marveled
[1:03:08] and they acknowledged that they had been
[1:03:09] with jesus
[1:03:11] i hope that every one of us this week
[1:03:14] will affect somebody out there
[1:03:16] yeah you're weird but we know you've
[1:03:18] been with jesus
[1:03:20] not that you've been with david mcgary
[1:03:22] no you've been with jesus that's what it
[1:03:24] was see that's their testimony
[1:03:26] okay
[1:03:28] and um
[1:03:29] so they saw the man that was healed
[1:03:32] and um
[1:03:33] so he says in verse 19
[1:03:35] whether it be right in the sight of god
[1:03:37] hearken unto you more than god judge ye
[1:03:40] we can only speak the things which we
[1:03:42] have seen and heard so when they had
[1:03:43] further threatened them they let them go
[1:03:45] finding nothing how they might punish
[1:03:47] them
[1:03:48] because of the people
[1:03:50] for all men glorified god for which was
[1:03:54] done so they were scared the leaders
[1:03:55] were scared of the people they were all
[1:03:57] on peter's side yeah we saw this we're
[1:04:00] we're glorifying god
[1:04:01] for the man was above 40 years old he'd
[1:04:03] been 40 years
[1:04:05] being carried every day there asking for
[1:04:07] money
[1:04:08] and now he's up jumping around praising
[1:04:10] god well yeah it's going to attract
[1:04:12] attention
[1:04:14] so they were released and acts 6
[1:04:17] finishing up here verses 23 through 30
[1:04:20] and being let go they went on their they
[1:04:22] went back to you know the group of
[1:04:24] believers
[1:04:25] and reported all that the chief priest
[1:04:26] and elders had said and when they heard
[1:04:29] all this they lifted up their voice to
[1:04:31] god with one accord
[1:04:32] and said lord thou art god which hath
[1:04:35] made heaven and earth and the sea and
[1:04:37] all that is in them who by the mouth of
[1:04:39] thy servant david has said why did the
[1:04:41] heathen rage and the people imagine vain
[1:04:43] things the kings of the earth stood up
[1:04:45] in the rulers and so forth
[1:04:47] forever truth against thy holy child
[1:04:49] jesus whom thou has anointed both herod
[1:04:52] and pontius pilate with the gentiles and
[1:04:54] the people of israel were gathered
[1:04:56] together for to do
[1:04:59] whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[1:05:01] determined so they knew about
[1:05:03] predestination whatever happened to
[1:05:05] jesus well it's we're not going to jump
[1:05:07] in there and try to kill pilate now all
[1:05:09] this is ordained it all turned out you
[1:05:11] just had to wait
[1:05:13] you see and now lord behold their
[1:05:15] threatenings and grant unto thy servants
[1:05:17] that they may have boldness to speak thy
[1:05:19] word
[1:05:20] by the stretching forth of thy hand to
[1:05:22] heal that signs and wonders may be done
[1:05:24] in the name of thy holy child jesus
[1:05:28] and when they had prayed
[1:05:30] the place was shaken where they were
[1:05:31] assembled
[1:05:32] and they were all filled the holy ghost
[1:05:35] and they speak the word of god with
[1:05:36] boldness
[1:05:38] and the multitude of them that believed
[1:05:39] were of one heart and one soul neither
[1:05:41] did any man you know
[1:05:43] have things that possessed to him they
[1:05:45] had all things in common
[1:05:47] and great power
[1:05:49] and with great power gave the apostles
[1:05:51] witness of the resurrection and so forth
[1:05:53] so they had this testimony service
[1:05:57] they had prayer god responded with an
[1:05:59] earthquake
[1:06:00] and refilling of the holy ghost
[1:06:03] and they shared things joyfully
[1:06:05] you know
[1:06:06] yeah
[1:06:08] and they had things in common but this
[1:06:10] was due to the persecution it was
[1:06:12] voluntary and it was only in jerusalem
[1:06:15] so
[1:06:16] quoting again from this morning as moses
[1:06:18] went with the judgment stick before him
[1:06:21] that same stick tonight to the church is
[1:06:24] jesus christ if the egyptians could have
[1:06:26] ever got that little simple stick out of
[1:06:28] moses hands they would have had him
[1:06:30] whipped and when the devil can ever get
[1:06:33] the deity out of the name of jesus
[1:06:34] christ he's got the church whipped
[1:06:38] and there's people in pullman pulpits
[1:06:40] tonight removing the deity out of jesus
[1:06:42] christ putting it over here over there
[1:06:44] and over there and these people are
[1:06:46] without any power because you take the
[1:06:48] deity out of the name of jesus christ
[1:06:49] you got nothing
[1:06:52] so paul wrote in his letter to the
[1:06:54] saints in philippi
[1:06:55] in chapter 2
[1:06:57] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:06:59] should bow
[1:07:01] of things in heaven
[1:07:03] things in earth things under the earth
[1:07:05] that every tongue should confess that
[1:07:07] jesus christ is lord
[1:07:11] that's not just the protestants
[1:07:13] that's the catholics and all the muslims
[1:07:15] and all the buddhists
[1:07:17] one day they're all going to know
[1:07:19] that we've been preaching the truth
[1:07:21] so may god bless you for the david
[1:07:26] [Applause]
[1:07:32] amen the brothers would go
[1:07:34] prepare the communion
[1:07:36] tonight
[1:07:38] you know it's certainly
[1:07:40] a great ally you have in the lord you
[1:07:43] know an ally is somebody who joins with
[1:07:45] you
[1:07:46] across our uh world
[1:07:49] countries will get together and they'll
[1:07:50] claim that uh
[1:07:52] they're
[1:07:53] our ally
[1:07:55] and uh we have an ally in the lord
[1:07:58] the one that'll fight our battles for us
[1:08:00] one that'll guide us direct us
[1:08:03] you know he he's there for us in
[1:08:06] and he's there to do for us exceedingly
[1:08:08] and abundantly even above what we can
[1:08:11] ask or think
[1:08:12] and you know it's amazing when we take
[1:08:15] things out of his hands
[1:08:17] we've really limited
[1:08:19] what can take place to our own
[1:08:21] possibilities
[1:08:23] and it really it hasn't even entered
[1:08:25] into our hearts
[1:08:26] the things that god's prepared for them
[1:08:29] that love them so way beyond anything
[1:08:32] that you could even anticipate
[1:08:35] or expect
[1:08:37] he can do it better
[1:08:39] hey man you might i've i've drawn out
[1:08:42] some pretty good plans for the lord
[1:08:45] you know and i think we just get in line
[1:08:48] and follow my plans everything would
[1:08:51] come out just perfect for me
[1:08:53] and not one of my plans has ever worked
[1:08:58] and of course you want people want to
[1:09:00] blame him
[1:09:02] you know
[1:09:03] you know like he said if we would follow
[1:09:06] it would be a lot easy you know and if
[1:09:09] we let the word of god speak to us so
[1:09:11] let stan we're going to have communion
[1:09:13] and
[1:09:15] tonight and we're going to turn over
[1:09:17] into matthew
[1:09:19] the
[1:09:22] 26th chapter
[1:09:24] of the book of matthew and we're going
[1:09:26] to start
[1:09:30] a
[1:09:32] reading here and and you know how
[1:09:34] brother george likes to go through and
[1:09:36] explain a drama
[1:09:38] well they're all here
[1:09:39] having the paths over and there's
[1:09:41] somebody at the table is going to betray
[1:09:44] him
[1:09:45] and the lord says somebody here is going
[1:09:47] to betray me tonight
[1:09:49] and you know the story and their sorrow
[1:09:51] of their heart and they're all wondering
[1:09:54] if it's them and they're having this me
[1:09:56] on them
[1:09:58] and it says in the 21st verse then judas
[1:10:01] which betrayed him answered and said
[1:10:03] master is it i
[1:10:05] and he said unto him thou hath said it
[1:10:09] and judas takes off
[1:10:11] and now here jesus takes to his
[1:10:13] disciples and here we institute
[1:10:17] communion
[1:10:19] and as they were eating
[1:10:21] jesus took bread and blessed it
[1:10:25] and break it
[1:10:27] and gave it to the disciples and said
[1:10:31] take eat
[1:10:32] this is my body
[1:10:35] and he took the cup
[1:10:37] and gave thanks
[1:10:39] and gave it to them saying drink ye all
[1:10:42] of it for this is my blood
[1:10:46] in the new testament which is shed for
[1:10:48] many
[1:10:50] for the remission of sins but i sand you
[1:10:53] i will not drink henceforth of this
[1:10:56] fruit of the vine until that day
[1:10:59] when i drink it anew
[1:11:01] with you
[1:11:02] in
[1:11:03] my father's
[1:11:05] kingdom
[1:11:06] now just think of that verse just for a
[1:11:08] second
[1:11:09] how many people don't take communion
[1:11:12] and yet he says
[1:11:15] i'm going to drink this with you
[1:11:18] you drink it here with me i'll drink it
[1:11:20] with you there
[1:11:21] you know without communion and foot
[1:11:24] washing
[1:11:25] you won't be there
[1:11:27] it it it's it's just what he said
[1:11:30] i didn't make that up i'm not enforcing
[1:11:32] that
[1:11:33] i don't enforce it
[1:11:35] but i
[1:11:36] simply have to say
[1:11:38] this is one of the things that god
[1:11:40] commands you
[1:11:41] to do
[1:11:43] and if the benefits of it
[1:11:46] are are are immense
[1:11:49] amen it's a time to examine yourself
[1:11:52] it's a time to make things right
[1:11:55] if there's a time to commit in your
[1:11:58] heart
[1:11:58] that if you have that thing that
[1:12:01] is going on that you're going to make a
[1:12:03] commitment in your heart you're going to
[1:12:05] handle it
[1:12:06] and then he says if you make that
[1:12:08] commitment
[1:12:09] you make that vow i'm going to take care
[1:12:11] of this i'm going to get this right i'm
[1:12:13] going to go make that right then you can
[1:12:15] come freely too and that's what
[1:12:17] communion is as a place for us to
[1:12:19] examine ourselves
[1:12:21] it's a place for us to pray one for
[1:12:24] another it's a communion
[1:12:26] with him
[1:12:27] and with one another
[1:12:29] to communicate to commune to share so
[1:12:33] you pray for one you pray for the other
[1:12:35] and it's it's a a wonderful
[1:12:39] time
[1:12:40] at this time
[1:12:41] so that is as we ask the bless the bread
[1:12:50] us all bow our heads together
[1:12:52] as we ask the lord to bless us our
[1:12:55] gracious heavenly father
[1:12:58] lord we have
[1:12:59] here the representation of your word
[1:13:04] the bread of life

[1:14:13] spirits
[1:14:14] that you would take us away from the
[1:14:16] things that would hinder us
[1:14:18] from growing in you and that your light
[1:14:21] might shine
