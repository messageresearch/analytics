Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 14th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; We are happy to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open our Bibles in Matthew chapter 16. Matthew chapter 16 and uh uh we're going to begin at at verse 14. Hallelujah. Matthew 16 verse14. And they said, oh, you're ready. Amen. Praise the Lord. And that said, some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. He said unto them, "But whom say ye that I that I am?" &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I said unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for the opportunity you give us to come together and learn from your word. Father, Lord, you have placed a thought in my heart, Lord. And Father, help me to share with your children, Lord, what you have placed in my heart and bless us. Bless the word, Father. Bless our pastor. Bless every minister min ministry in this place, Lord. And Lord, that you may come and speak to us once again, Lord. Father God, help me to put myself aside. Lord, that your Holy Ghost may take uh control of everything that I say and do. Father, close my mouth to anything that is contrary to your word and open it to all truth and righteousness. For I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. Hallelujah. It's uh it's always uh nerve-wracking to see to have so many eyes looking at you. Hallelujah. But we are happy to be here. &gt;&gt; And um I I would like to to uh if if we can title this uh thought, I would like to title it against the the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; Against the gates of hell. Uh, brother Branham, I I was listening to uh, works is faith express preaching 65 and and brother Bram says, "It was upon the spiritual revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, Peter. But my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you and upon this rock, the revelation of who he is." upon the revelation. He is a word in the whole. Upon this rock I I build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. It showed the gates of hell would be against it. &gt;&gt; So the gates of hell are against the revelation &gt;&gt; of who Jesus Christ is. That's why there's been a battle for over 2,000 years &gt;&gt; of who Jesus Christ is &gt;&gt; and the council of Nika. Do you know how they split &gt;&gt; and they split over the name &gt;&gt; and anyone who did not agree with with Constantine was kicked out and was persecuted and the church has been persecuted for 2,000 years now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God slowly but surely has been restoring everything back to the church &gt;&gt; until we get to our age where everything that we need to go into the rapture has been restored. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we don't make it in the rapture, it's our fault. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Cuz you and I had been given every tool that's needed to go in the rapture. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You know, &gt;&gt; it's 1,200 uh sermons. &gt;&gt; We have no excuse. &gt;&gt; We're like, "Oh, I don't know what to do tonight." Listen to a message. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm bored. Listen to a message. &gt;&gt; I'm going to drive eight hours. Listen to a message. &gt;&gt; I cannot go to sleep. &gt;&gt; Listen to a message. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That's that that's that's what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; We have the tools. &gt;&gt; We have the tools. We have to use the tools. &gt;&gt; If you don't use the tools, you cannot prevail. &gt;&gt; You cannot prevail if you don't use the tools. &gt;&gt; The tools are given to you to prevail to overcome &gt;&gt; to def to defeat the enemy that has been defeated already. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in Second World War uh in and when when when when the United States uh uh bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the the the war was over cuz I mean and imagine no one can stand against that power. But you see there was they didn't have the the communication we have now, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; except for today. Verizon is not working. But we they didn't have the communication we that that we have now. &gt;&gt; So for months many people did not know that the war was over. &gt;&gt; There were a lot of Americans fighting in many islands &gt;&gt; who thought they were losing the battle &gt;&gt; because if it was one to one against the enemy, the American people did not have any opportunity &gt;&gt; because the Japanese were fearless. The Japanese, one Japanese man could kill many people. [cough] &gt;&gt; The Japanese thought they were fighting a a war or a battle that they were winning, &gt;&gt; but if it was a paradox &gt;&gt; cuz they were winning a battle, but they lost a war. &gt;&gt; Huh? And the Americans were losing a battle. &gt;&gt; But they had already won the war. &gt;&gt; You know, we are about the same &gt;&gt; cuz Satan knows he lost the war. &gt;&gt; But he is a liar. &gt;&gt; He is a master of deceit. &gt;&gt; And he makes us think that we are lost. &gt;&gt; He makes us think that think that we are losers. &gt;&gt; No, you're not a loser. I'm not a loser. &gt;&gt; Nobody is a loser in this place &gt;&gt; because we are on the side of the one who overcame. &gt;&gt; He defeated Satan. &gt;&gt; He defeated the grave. &gt;&gt; He defeated death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's it. My sermon is over. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You get I get too excited. &gt;&gt; Pray for me. &gt;&gt; Pray for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 22, &gt;&gt; we find Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now remember, we we are we are talking about the gates, the gates of hell prevailing. No, we prevail against the g gates of hell. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell against the children of God. Satan from the beginning, that's that he he he he his his uh idea was to be he wants to be worshiped like God, &gt;&gt; right? He wants to defeat God's plan. But how can you defeat the one who knows everything? &gt;&gt; He knows your thoughts &gt;&gt; and he knows the intentions of your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. So how can Satan fight against a person like that? But Satan is very intelligent, &gt;&gt; you know. He is more intelligent than than all of us together. &gt;&gt; He knows the Bible better than all of us together. He knows science better than than the scientist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we know God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's all we need. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it came uh Genesis 22:1. And it came to pass after this things that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold, here I am. And he said, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Mariah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains, which I will tell thee of." &gt;&gt; So God is testing his son. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "God loves to test his children &gt;&gt; to see how we are going to react. He gives you a test. &gt;&gt; If you have if you if you are been tested, it's from God. &gt;&gt; Don't blame the poor devil. &gt;&gt; It's God &gt;&gt; giving you a test &gt;&gt; because he wants to make you realize that you are an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And look, and then then let's just skip to verse 11. And Abraham obeys God. Isaac is on the altar. He's about to kill his only son, the one that he spoke about for 25 years. &gt;&gt; And now he's about to kill him and he's willing to kill him. &gt;&gt; But you have to understand to do the sacrifice, the whole sacrifice, it was not just to kill Isaac. It was to burn him. ashes to ashes. &gt;&gt; But he knew that the one who gave the promise &gt;&gt; even from the ashes can bring his his son back. &gt;&gt; That's that's the God we serve. &gt;&gt; He wants to see our reaction. He wants to see my reaction. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what happens when when you don't pass a test? &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. You have to retake it. &gt;&gt; If you don't pass a grade, said, "Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Sergio. Your son didn't pass fifth grade." Well, what if I give you $100? &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be helping my son. &gt;&gt; No, he has to take it again &gt;&gt; and take it again and take it again until he passes that. Sometimes we go in a circle. &gt;&gt; And you know why we go in a circle? &gt;&gt; Because we're not passing the test, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and to pass a test, you have to study, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You cannot study the night before the test and then pray and be like, I know God is going to help me. No, he's not. No, you have to memorize everything. You have to know 2 plus 2 is four. 2 * 2 is four, right? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. 8 by two is four. You have to know all the answers. &gt;&gt; You have to know what you're doing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But if you don't study, if you don't get prepared, &gt;&gt; you will fail again. &gt;&gt; And that's where many of us are. You have all the tools there. &gt;&gt; Remember, you have the tools. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell are against you. Satan doesn't want you to overcome. He doesn't want you to pass a test. He wants you to stay where you're at. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, let me tell you, as long as we are here on on on this flesh, we need to get better. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Is not you you can't just be like, "Oh, well, I already made it." Yes, but I God wants you to get better &gt;&gt; every time, every day, &gt;&gt; every hour. &gt;&gt; And he will test you once and once again, &gt;&gt; and he will pass you through the fire once and once again because you're too precious to him. You're more precious than gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your faith needs to be tested. My faith needs to be tested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And the angel of Genesis 22. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said,"Abraham, Abraham," and he said, "Here, here am I." And he said, "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." The fear of the Lord. The fear of the Lord. Why are we why are we g Why are we willing to give up for the fear of the Lord? &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; why are we willing to give up for the fear of the Lord? Abraham was willing to give everything up &gt;&gt; to please God. &gt;&gt; And we are Abraham's seed &gt;&gt; by faith &gt;&gt; because we have the same faith of Abraham. Verse 13. And Abraham lift up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offer him up for a burnt offering in the in the state of his son. God provides. &gt;&gt; God will let you go to the edge to the very end of the trial. And as long as you keep trusting him, he will give you the answer. &gt;&gt; He will give you the exit. &gt;&gt; He will show there for you. &gt;&gt; You don't know how, but he will do it. &gt;&gt; He will do it. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra. As it is said to this day, in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine than only son, that in that in blessing I will bless thee, &gt;&gt; and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven. &gt;&gt; We are like the stars of heaven. No wonder there were seven stars on his right hand because they were Abraham's seed. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. That in that in blessing I will bless thee that in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as a sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the gates of hell shall not prevail &gt;&gt; against they &gt;&gt; against the revelation. &gt;&gt; Your seat shall possess the gates of its enemies. &gt;&gt; Now the Paul teaches us that we're not fighting against flesh or blood. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we're fighting against powers of the air. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're fighting against spirits. &gt;&gt; That's what we fight. The devil comes and he puts thoughts in our heads and he's all the time &gt;&gt; putting thoughts in our heads and we have to be careful what we put in our head. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That's the reason that you have to fill your head. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz you will be thinking about this if you fill it with this. If you wake up in the morning, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; when you wake up, huh, and instead of opening the word, you open something else, that's what's going to be in your head. &gt;&gt; Before you go to sleep &gt;&gt; before you go to sleep, whatever you're thinking about, that's what's going to be in your head. &gt;&gt; So, we need the tools. &gt;&gt; The tools are reliable. &gt;&gt; They're given to us in the form of a book. And [snorts] if you have a phone, you even can put it in an app. You even can play uh Brother Brian, I'm on YouTube. You can play the Bible on YouTube. You can download an app and play the Bible on your app. &gt;&gt; There's no excuse. &gt;&gt; If you haven't read the Bible, and I don't mean like one chapter or threequarters of the Bible or half of the Bible, but if you haven't read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, You're lacking tools. &gt;&gt; You need the tools. &gt;&gt; So do something. &gt;&gt; You know, I need to memorize it. I need to memorize it. No, it's not going to work like that. Open it and read it. &gt;&gt; It's your tools to overcome the devil. You know, Brother Ram says, "We we we we want something exciting and and and you know, jumping and fire falling from heaven and and everybody screaming, but you know what? When you go home, when you when when all that scream and all that, it's nice. Don't get me wrong. I like to scream when I feel the praise of the Lord. It's all nice. But when you get home, you go back to reality, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and reality reality tells you, uhoh, &gt;&gt; I need to pay my bills. I have problems at work. &gt;&gt; How am I going to do this? How am I going to fix my car? How am I going to pay for this? How am I going to do the other thing? Oh, my children, my wife, my husband. I'm sick. I need to go to the doctor. The doctor told me I have cancer. What if the doctor tells me I have cancer? It's a fight. It's a fight. It's a fight every single day. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you fill yourself with this, &gt;&gt; Abraham says this is the most powerful tool, &gt;&gt; the most powerful weapon &gt;&gt; that God gave to his children. &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says if God had anything better to give us, he would have given it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard somebody if you got if you want God to speak to you, read your Bible out loud. You know, cuz we we want something exciting. No, it's there &gt;&gt; every day. Your daily walk &gt;&gt; builds your character. &gt;&gt; And character is not a gift. &gt;&gt; Character is a victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every every trial that you pass is a victory. &gt;&gt; Every storm you go through is a victory. Every time you obey God, even when you don't feel like it, it's a victory. &gt;&gt; Even when you're crying, &gt;&gt; you can go to school tomorrow and they tell you you have a test. &gt;&gt; Say, "But I didn't study for that test." It don't matter. You're going to have a test tomorrow. I'm not prophesying, by the way. Okay? It's not You're going to be worried like what? &gt;&gt; You're going to have a test tomorrow. You go to school, you sit there, you're thinking, "Oh, well, we're going to go to chapter 15 of science or whatever you're taking there, physics." And all of a sudden, your teacher says, "Well, put your books away. Put your calculators away. Put your your telephones away. We are going to have a test. Surprise. You can cry if you want to. That's good. &gt;&gt; But that's not going to help you. &gt;&gt; You can answer your test crying." Yes. You know, be so mad at the teacher on why do I get a test today? Well, your teacher has been telling you for every hour you go to school, you have to study how many at home. Three hours for every hour of class. Can you believe that? No time. That's so crazy. But that's what they expect from from everybody that goes to to college. What about the Bible? What about the word of God? &gt;&gt; That's what they expect you. Then you get a test and you're like, I don't know the answer. I don't know the answer. The doctor said I was I'm sick and I don't know the answer. Yes, you know the answer. Calm down. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Take a deep breath. &gt;&gt; Look at the question &gt;&gt; and think by his stripes &gt;&gt; I've been healed. &gt;&gt; Yes. Well, I I don't know how am I going to pay for this. &gt;&gt; He's still your provider. &gt;&gt; You know, but my children, they you don't understand, brother. I I I raised them in in the in the in the church. I raised them in the message. I did the best I could, but like they they're going to the world. Don't worry, they'll come back. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Remember, we've been listening to live taking the promises of God &gt;&gt; and make making them alive for us. &gt;&gt; It's a living promise. &gt;&gt; So when you when you when you're going through the test, it's all right to cry. &gt;&gt; When you go through the test, it's all right to be mad. Jonah was mad. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was crying. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; it's all right. Don't worry. You will pass a test. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You will pass a test. &gt;&gt; Maybe you have to take it again, but you will pass it &gt;&gt; because he will make sure that you pass a test &gt;&gt; because the gates of hell cannot prevail against the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many demons from hell come to torment you. Let me tell you, they have no power over the children of the living God. Who? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; He overcame. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. You you you have to go through the test. You have to be willing to go through the test. &gt;&gt; In order to receive the blessing, &gt;&gt; in order to receive that blessing, your seed shall possess the gates of their enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, I'm under that promise. And my children, I don't know if they know it or not, but they're under that promise. &gt;&gt; My wife is under that promise. &gt;&gt; We are going to possess the gate of our enemies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, brother, but you know, I I need this. I need that job. I need that position, but they're not going to give it to me." Says who? Right. &gt;&gt; Says who? &gt;&gt; If you know it's going to get you closer to the Lord, go around there 13 times. &gt;&gt; Huh? So, it's mine. It's mine. The Lord said it's mine because you have to believe the confession of your mouth. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's that's what what the third pool that's what the what what what the voice told brother Ranham when he said the squirrels &gt;&gt; said but but I I one was created already. Yeah but you said three. &gt;&gt; He said you need to believe in the confession of your mouth. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. Not just say it &gt;&gt; but believe it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, one of my children came back to the word. Well, I don't know how many you have left, &gt;&gt; but keep confessing. &gt;&gt; Keep confessing. &gt;&gt; His promises are true. &gt;&gt; His promises are real. &gt;&gt; They do not fail. &gt;&gt; I fail, you fail, and everybody fails. But God cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the in the message the patriarch Abraham preaching 64, brother Abraham says that's just exactly what it means. I believe it's par paragraph 12. Now, if you're ready to take the test of God's acid test, you know, when you go and pay with a bill, $100 bill, they have a little pen. It's got some kind of asset. They test it, see if it's real or not. You are the real deal. &gt;&gt; You are. You are the real deal. That's why you're being tested. &gt;&gt; You're being tested because God wants you to know who you are. &gt;&gt; He wants you to realize what you're made of. &gt;&gt; It's hard. Test is not easy. No, it's not easy. But once you pass a test, you're like, "Yes, I made it." &gt;&gt; Somebody might say, "Well, look, I got an A+. I got a C minus." But I made it. &gt;&gt; You know, we laugh about those things, but it's true. &gt;&gt; A lot of times it's only his grace and mercy that help us move forward. &gt;&gt; Cuz man, so many times we just go through the word of God with a C minus, C minus, C minus. But thanks be to God that he's rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I know my son Sergio, he is not an A+ Christian, but hey, he's making it. One of these days, he's going to straighten himself up. &gt;&gt; You know, he's going to be an A+ and I'm going to be proud of him and I'm going to seal him with my Holy Ghost." [laughter] But keep going. Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't put your books down, &gt;&gt; you know. No, don't don't put your Bible down. Just because you're going through the trial doesn't mean the answer is not here. Just because you're going through the trial doesn't mean God is not answering your prayers. Just keep talking to him. He is our teacher. He is our master. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And follow that prescription. I'm telling you, you'll find out that God keeps his word if you believe it. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's right. But you got to go through that because that's the seal. When you can receive it, then you will receive the promise because it's God's prescription. The way we should do it and that's the way we got to follow it. Just what he said. Not not just to some, but to whosoever believeth. Whosoever repenteth, whosoever believeth is to all generations, to all people, whosoever wants to believe it. And faith in God's word brings you to his promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be in his word. &gt;&gt; You have to believe his word. &gt;&gt; In order to believe his word, you have to know what it says. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says, "Open your Bible in Psalms 152." And you're like, "Very worried." No, you already failed the test. Amen. Yes. It's simple. If if you stay in the word, if you fill your mind with the word, God will do the rest. &gt;&gt; And God will make sure that the word comes down into your heart. When I was when I I when I went I I got a scholarship when I got out of high school and I I went for music, okay? because I didn't know any better and I thought, you know, well, that's the life. But I was poor, poorer. [laughter] I was poor. I'm not poor anymore. I have Christ, &gt;&gt; and I have three beautiful girls, one beautiful wife, and one very handsome son. I think that makes me more than rich, &gt;&gt; you know. I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going to be African, and for my girls, I'm going to ask for cows. Rich brother said, "Brother Sergio, I'm sorry. My mind wanders. Pray for me. Pray for me." Now, when my son gets married, I'll become Mexican again. But let me tell you, God's promises are true. &gt;&gt; They don't fail. &gt;&gt; They don't fail. You're going through the trial, you're going through the tribulation, the answer is in his word. &gt;&gt; No matter what the problem is, the answer is in his word. &gt;&gt; Says it's cancer, the answer is in his word. Amen. It's marital problems, the answer is in the word. Children problem, the answer is in the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to gain weight, the answer is in the word. You need to lose weight, the answer is in the word. He said every answer. Every answer, brother. Yes. You want to know what type of car you need to buy? The answer is in the word. You want to find a girlfriend, the answer, well, you know what? That is stuff about finding girlfriend is not right. &gt;&gt; You waste your time when you find your girlfriend, that's the stuff from the world. You want to find a wife. &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say he who findeth a girlfriend. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; the B the Bible says he who findeth a wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That girlfriend and boyfriend stuff, that's from the world. If you're ready to date someone, it's because you're ready to get married. &gt;&gt; If you're not going to get married, then stop it. &gt;&gt; Don't play games because you're playing the devil's games. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was part of the test, brother. &gt;&gt; It was not in in here, but God knows that somebody needs to listen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, if you're 15 and you're thinking, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no." &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your daddy said. I'm telling you, no. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Say amen if you have a daughter. &gt;&gt; Because that's the truth. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. We we we want we we want to go with with with the with with the world. &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; 75% of the marriages do not make it to one year. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? You know, &gt;&gt; because they're finding the f Let me see if it works with that one. If it doesn't, no. No. When you want to find a wife, you want to go on prayer. &gt;&gt; It's right here in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to do what Abraham did. You know what Abraham did? He found He went looking for a wife for his son. Oh, that's old fashioned, brother. &gt;&gt; That's old fashioned. &gt;&gt; Yes. But that's part of the test. You know, you want one with little feet that smells good. That's a message. Now, huh? That one will fail you. You want the one with the pretty eyes, huh? That one will fail you. But if you're not, if you go beyond that, if you don't if you're not looking at the looks, &gt;&gt; but you're looking for character, &gt;&gt; you're looking for character, that will stay forever. That man with character. And I'm not saying that boy. No, that man. Cuz if you're marrying a boy, you're wasting your time. &gt;&gt; That man with character is going to stick to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you gain a 100 pounds, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, he will stick with you. &gt;&gt; That woman with character &gt;&gt; will it stick to you, brother. Even if you lose your teeth. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what we're that we're talking about the gates of hell. &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that I when I talk, you know, people laugh. It doesn't matter. You have to think &gt;&gt; that the devil wants to destroy you. Brother Abraham says demon in demonology, demons are here to torment us. &gt;&gt; So when we go into marriage, and this message was not even about marriage. It's not even in my notes, okay? But when you go into marriage and then you're not ready for it, that's the the devil's job is to torment you. And and if you are married and it's out of God's will, you will be tormented for the rest of your life. Not only because it might not work, but because if you get divorced, the devil is going to come and torment you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell &gt;&gt; shall not prevent prevail against your marriage. &gt;&gt; That's a good one. Maybe I need to change the title of the sermon, brother. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail against my family. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail against my children. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail against my health. It doesn't matter what the devil tells me. It doesn't matter what the X-ray, the MRI, the cities can't tell me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. Let me give you a little testimony. When when I came when we came here the first time, I was very sick. I I I the doctor thought that I had a tumor in my in my brain and and uh and and I I didn't feel good. Of course, you try to hide it from the children and everybody, but but I didn't feel good. And sometimes I thought maybe I didn't even think straight because, you know, it was bad. And of course, the devil comes and whispers in your ear because that's his job to torment you, &gt;&gt; you know, and uh and and of and and and one of the things that I did is I asked for prayer. So when when I came when I when we came here the first time and and the brother said if if you need prayer come forward. I came forward and I asked the pastor to pray for me &gt;&gt; and I told him what the problem is. Of course I give him the medical terminology. He's like it's a demon and he prayed for me. &gt;&gt; Went back did the MRI the doctor said there's nothing there. [applause] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. You go through the test, you are scared, you are crying, but keep going. &gt;&gt; Take the test anyways cuz there is a God who will answer your prayers. &gt;&gt; There is a God that will answer your prayers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whosoever believeth. Praise the Lord. And faith in God's word brings you to this promise. &gt;&gt; Then and then only can you have power to possess the seal of the promise. You have to possess the promise. Every promise that's in the word of God, you have to make it yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every promise that God gave to Abraham, you have to make it yours. &gt;&gt; You have to claim it. &gt;&gt; You have to claim it. It's mine. Healing is mine. Salvation is mine. The Holy Ghost is mine. Amen. Freedom is mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then and then only can you have power to possess the seal of the promise. And the promise that we receive the seal is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So you wanted your answer about how how can I get when can I get married? &gt;&gt; Possess that seal. &gt;&gt; Possess that seal and God will guide you to the right girl. &gt;&gt; Possess that seal and God will guide you to the right to the right man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. If not, you're going to be jumping. And the devil is going to torment you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. For that is God in the form of spirit. His word in you that he comes in as you receive the word. The Holy Spirit is the only thing that can make that live. &gt;&gt; The word of God will become alive only through the Holy Spirit of God &gt;&gt; living in you. And when you have the promise of possessing the gate of every enemy, &gt;&gt; did he said some of the enemies? &gt;&gt; Did he said, "Well, maybe these enemy in that one maybe Goliath is too big for you. You won't be able to take him." &gt;&gt; You don't need to take Goliath. All you need is a little rock &gt;&gt; and his slingshot. I I don't know if you if if if any anyone here I I used we used to make slingshots from old tires and sticks down in Mexico, right, brother? Huh? And they were we were good, brother. I mean, we're like that person over there. Let's see if I can aim. That's all you need to defeat the devil. &gt;&gt; You need to believe in the promise of God. It might be a little revelation. &gt;&gt; It might look like a little revelation to you or to the world like like David's little rock. &gt;&gt; It was a little revelation, but that was part of Jesus. Brother said he picked five rocks. Why? That the Bible says, &gt;&gt; right? Brother says Jesus s Jesus. He grabbed one rock, one revelation, put it on the slingshot. [snorts] He he he couldn't miss &gt;&gt; because he was guided &gt;&gt; by his faith in Jehovah. &gt;&gt; He said to to Goliath, "You come against me uh with a spear and a sword, but I come against you &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord of hosts." [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; You fight the enemy. You don't fight the enemy by yourself. It doesn't matter if you think you're little. If your revelation is little, if you don't have enough revelation, it doesn't matter. As long as you have a little revelation of who Jesus Christ is, you are on the winning side. &gt;&gt; As long as you have a little revelation of who Jesus Christ is, you will defeat the enemy. Not one enemy, not have the enemies, but all the enemies that stand against you, you will defeat them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. The devil comes and and and whispers because that's his job. He's a very good whisperer, you know. Huh? He whispers. He tells you stuff when you're by yourself. He makes He wants to make you feel like you're alone. He He wants to make you feel depressed. He wants you He wants to make you feel worthless. &gt;&gt; But you're not worthless. &gt;&gt; You're not worthless. &gt;&gt; No, you don't have to be in depression. No, there is a God &gt;&gt; who saw you before the foundation of the world and wrote your name in the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Your future is already written in the lamb's book of God. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how it goes here on earth. You know, you may be a very rich, you may be very poor, you may be very handsome, you may not be that handsome, &gt;&gt; but you will make it somehow. &gt;&gt; That's the thing about this. you will make it somehow. &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's that's why that's what I love about about fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't that's what I that's what I love about fellowship. You can fellowship with a brother who is a millionaire &gt;&gt; and don't feel less. &gt;&gt; And fellowship with a brother that has nothing and don't feel more &gt;&gt; cuz you know that your worth is not in the money you have or the clothes you wear. &gt;&gt; But your worth is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; The blood that purchases you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like what the pastor said. The blood, the same blood that purchased me purchased you. The same amount of blood that was paid for me was paid for you. So don't think that you're less. No, you're not less. It doesn't matter what Satan has gotten you through or how how how many storms he has brought to your life, &gt;&gt; how low you you have gone, &gt;&gt; how far away you have gone, &gt;&gt; you're you're worth it before the sight of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He paid for you. &gt;&gt; He died for you. He cried for you &gt;&gt; because of you. He was in Gethsemane and he was about to give up because he was just a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Graham says the victory was not obtained in Calvary. The victory was obtained in Gethsemane when he said not my will be done father but your will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when we do God's will then we have the victory because he will get you through. &gt;&gt; He will get you through. When Jesus was walking to Calvary, he wasn't walking as God. He was walking as man because he was showing the devil that any man that any man can defeat Satan. &gt;&gt; He wasn't in he wasn't going in like God cuz God cannot die. &gt;&gt; That's why he said but my Lord why my Lord why have you forsaken me? Imagine feeling all the fullness of God your whole life. Fullness feel filling all the fullness of God. The whole power of the universe more than the universe. The creator of the universe. and for three years and a half walk in with the power of the resurrection and all of the sudden all of the sudden everything is taken away from you and you feel nothing and you feel no power and you feel no presence of the Holy Ghost and you feel you're alone and you know all the demons from hell are coming to attack you. You are feeling hopeless and helpless but you are not trusting in your own understanding. You are not trusting in your own strength. You are trusting in the word of [screaming] God. [applause] &gt;&gt; That that that's my Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. It looked like he was being defeated, but no, he wasn't being defeated. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He was doing that because that was written in the word of God about him that he was going to suffer like that, that he was going to die like that. But he had to believe the word that when he died, he was not going to stay in hell for more than three days. That he was going to be raised again. &gt;&gt; And he believed the word. He didn't feel the presence of God anymore. Can you [snorts] &gt;&gt; sometimes I feel like that. I don't know about you, but sometimes I feel like the presence of God is not with me anymore. &gt;&gt; And that's when that's when the faith comes in. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not when you feel good, not when you feel like a like a champ, but when you feel defeated, when you feel that you cannot come through, when you feel that you don't even want to go to church, when you feel that you don't even want to wake up in the morning. &gt;&gt; That's when you say, "Lord, in your word is written about me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take every promise of this holy Bible &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make it mine. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how I feel, &gt;&gt; how good or bad That's right. &gt;&gt; How much the devil whispers in my ear. &gt;&gt; I'm going to listen to the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And the message I will restore pri showed the gates of hell would be against it, but it could not prevail. Satan cannot prevail. It may look like you're losing, but remember you're not. &gt;&gt; The war was won. &gt;&gt; The war was won. &gt;&gt; What do you think he sent us as as a seventh the seventh angel with a trumpet? What do you think the trumpet was announcing? War. It was the last battle to fight before the rapture. And you are, you and I are going through that battle. &gt;&gt; You and I are going through that battle. And it's the battle of the mind. The greatest battle ever fought in human history. It's been fought right now. &gt;&gt; Because every single day we are bombarded through the phone, through the internet, everywhere we go. the radio, the phone listens to your conversations. &gt;&gt; You know it's true. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Whatever you say, all of a sudden it appears there. &gt;&gt; It shows there. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Satan is bombarding you. He wants you. He wants you to feel without purpose. We spend six, seven hours on the phone. No mind, no brain, no thoughts. Brother says, "Do not put your mind in blank because the devil will feel it." &gt;&gt; And that's what the devil does to us when we are on the phone. Our minds become blank. &gt;&gt; And when our minds become blank, that's when depression comes. A lot of kids with depression nowadays. Why? Because their minds are blank. Take the phone away. Give him a little ball. Kick him outside. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; I'm bored. Well, now let's pick up the trash. Let's cut the yard. Let's help mom cleaning the dishes. I promise you're not going to be bored after this. But that's a problem. It's a fight. It's a ma mind of a battle of the mind. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I can never stay in in in in my thought. I I look at my notes and I'm like, I'm going to say this and that and the other. And I'm not good at that. I'm not good at that. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; In the message in the in the in the thy sitarian church H paragraph 74 some of them say well the great Catholic church has stood the waves why it proves that she is a real church why is not strange why it's not a strange thing to me with the state and everything else behind her she could exist but was a strange thing is a little bunch of is is a little bunch that's pulled off, the little minority kicked out, thrown in jail, sawed to pieces. And we're seeing it in Iran. We're seeing it in China. We're seeing it in North Korea and other places where they cannot stop the believers. They can't because it doesn't matter what you do to a believer. There is a seed of God that the devil cannot take away. &gt;&gt; How did they ever exist? Because the spirit of the living God moves in their being. And all the demons of hell cannot prevail against it. Again, all the demons of hell cannot prevail against it. You will have f fights. You will have battles. The demons are going to come and torment you. But be sure of this. They will not prevail against you &gt;&gt; sooner or later. Sooner or later, it has to flee. &gt;&gt; You got to get stung. &gt;&gt; You got to exercise your faith a little bit. &gt;&gt; Brother says faith [laughter] faith has hair in the chest. &gt;&gt; Huh? Faith has muscles. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't give up. &gt;&gt; No. You tell the devil he's a liar. &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning and when the devil whispers to you, you tell him you are a liar. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham spoke to the devil. He was driving said the devil was sitting there talking to me and telling me, you know, God doesn't exist. [laughter] If if if the devil spoke to Jesus and he spoke to Abraham, what makes you think the devil is not going to come and talk to you? &gt;&gt; The devil is going to come and whisper to us all the time. &gt;&gt; But we got to know the word. &gt;&gt; Because why? Because brother Ram says the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere &gt;&gt; under any circumstance. &gt;&gt; Any circumstance. You mean to tell me that if I slid, the word of God will defeat Satan [laughter] under any circumstance? You mean to tell me if I am very sick, the word of God will defeat Satan under any circumstance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of the living God moves in their being. How do they ever exist? Because of this, the spirit of the living God moves in their being and all the demons of hell cannot prevail against it. Upon this rock, I'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it. There's the real thing. That's what gives the Holy Ghost to these Methodist preachers. and so forth here. See, it makes them rise up, does something to you. It'll never fail. &gt;&gt; Never. It will not fail. You know, and Isaiah uh 54:17 says, "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." &gt;&gt; But you have the weapons to destroy the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes. 2 Corinthians 10:4, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, &gt;&gt; but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds. It doesn't matter how strong the devil is, what kind of hold he has upon you, upon your family, upon your children, upon your loved ones, upon your husband, upon your wife. You have the weapons to take that demon down. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. You just have to remember who's on your side. &gt;&gt; Huh? Because look, Saul, look at Goliath. David, look at God. It all depends on who you're looking to looking at. &gt;&gt; If you're looking at at the devil, of course, he's bigger than you. Yes. But if you're looking at God, &gt;&gt; God is bigger than the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings. He says prayer changes even the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So that's that's nothing we have to go back to. Prayer. &gt;&gt; Prayer. &gt;&gt; Christians do two things. I learned that from brother Billy Paul. Christians do you know here listening to him Christian do two things. He said pray and read their Bible. &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple? But yet it's hard. It's [clears throat] hard. You got to stop and think and purposely purposely sit down or kneel down and say, "I am going to talk to God." &gt;&gt; Or even standing up. &gt;&gt; Yes. But say, "I am going to talk to God right now because I need to talk to him." You have to do, you have to do it with purpose. You have to stop what you're doing. You have to stop everything and said, "I'm going to read a chapter a day." Because you know what they say, a chapter a day gives the devil away. They don't say that, but I said it. Huh? You read your word, you talk to God, you're going to start overcoming. You're going to see demon after demon being defeated. &gt;&gt; One step at a time, one demon at a time. [laughter] I I like I like what the pastor said about being free. You know, we come and we said, "Brother, please pray for me because, you know, I'm fighting, I don't know, pornography." Then the next time, pastor, come and pray for me because, you know, pornography left me, but now I'm fighting cigarettes. Next time, no, it doesn't work like that. But in order to overcome, you have to fill your head with something because the smoke, the devil will give you smoke. The devil will give you any excuse to disobey the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you need to pray. You need to pray. And prayer changes even the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Prayer in message expectation. Prayer opens the door. Prayer. Whatsoever you ask in prayer with faith believing you shall receive it. Ask abundantly that your joy may be full. &gt;&gt; That's John 16:24. See his attack and is this is in the message. The greatest battle ever fought preaching 62 paragraph 400 from what I have here. See his attack. Watch. Listen close. This closing his attack is what? Disbelieve God's word. That's his attack there. Can there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought? There's only two forces, Satan and God. And what is Satan's weapon against you? What is his weapon against you? Is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon. So now I have a weapon. Now I have a weapon. But Satan, his job is to make me disbelieve my weapon. &gt;&gt; Is try to get you to disbelieve your weapon. He disarms you. Let's listen real quiet now. Listen. If he can if if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent. If he gets you to disbelieve that your weapon is not strong enough, he has disarm you. It's just a book. It's just paper with ink. But when you read it, it becomes a thought. And when you speak it, it becomes a whirl. &gt;&gt; It becomes an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It becomes a transforming power. &gt;&gt; That's your weapon. &gt;&gt; You have it. If you don't have a weapon, go and buy one. [laughter] Don't Don't bring your phone. Uh oh, I'm in troubles now. That's right. You need to open your Bible and read it because your phone has a lot of other stuff that you also look at. But this word is sacred, &gt;&gt; holy, pure. &gt;&gt; This is the greatest book that has ever been placed in the hands of human beings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Neville, I hope we never believe that. Look, he disarm you when he gets you to disbelieve the weapon. When you lay that down, that finishes your fight. You're done. Never lay it down. Keep it close to your heart, close to your mind, right? Put it on the walls of your house, on the entrance of your house, on the exit of your house, in your car when you go to work. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, he disarm you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon. When you lay that down, that finishes you. That finishes your fight. You're done. Hold that weapon. Don't you lay it down. We see his unbelief. Don't let that weapon down. Don't let that weapon down. Hallelujah. Because he he says in in in the in the in the message the conflict between God and Satan preach in 62. But God at the beginning gave his children an atomic weapon because he's the infinite God. Now seeing there was going to be a conflict. He already knew there was going to be a conflict. &gt;&gt; You're going through a conflict. &gt;&gt; He already knew that. &gt;&gt; Your conflict, your problem, your situation is not taking God by surprise. He knows it &gt;&gt; because he's he's the infinite God. Now, since there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle, God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition, &gt;&gt; right kind of attack, the right kind of everything that they had the need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Was that &gt;&gt; the word? The word and the gates of hell will not prevail against it. Will not prevail against it. Hallelujah. Jesus overcame everything. He overcame hell, death, grave, every demon. They they thought they got him, but they didn't. &gt;&gt; It was just their trap. He was their trap. Brother Ram says the sting of death. You know, Satan plays the sting of death in Abel and he killed him. Plays the sting of death in every one of the prophets and he killed them. He said, "This one is going to be same as any of them." And he places the sting of death and then he tries to get it out. There was a problem there. &gt;&gt; Huh? This man looked like a man, but he was more than a man. &gt;&gt; He looked like he was just a prophet, but he was more than a prophet. He looked like any other rabbi, but he was more than a rabbi. &gt;&gt; He was God on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he veiled himself so much that Satan wasn't even sure about it. You know, when he tempts him and and after Jesus is baptized in the river and sat Satan is tempting him, he's asking him if you are. &gt;&gt; If you are, why is he not saying that? Because Satan doesn't know whether you are or not. The only one that knows who is seed or not seed is the father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I'm going to finish reading this. This is brotherham praying. Okay. I pray God have mercy. No one wants to go to the region of the lost. No one wants to go down there, Father. Far be it from any of us going. Yet down in here is a good heart in that person, that man, that woman, a man or a woman that's charitable and nice and kind and has just been deceived by the devil. The devil done that. Satan, I'm against you because you are an enemy of my Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord and we are against him. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid. Are we against Satan? &gt;&gt; We are against Satan. Satan, I'm against you because you are the name an enemy of my Lord. You are an an enemy of his word. and I charged thee by Jesus Christ, the son of God as a mortal being, knowing that I have no power within myself. I have empowered to stop you. I have power to make you to make any of these women clean up, any of these men that's listening uh to this tape or or whatever. I have no way of making them clean up. I'm powerless. But I but I do have the authority of God's word as a servant to preach it and duty bound to the to that authority. Neither these policemen out out here have a power to stop a car, but he has authority to do it. And Satan, you might as well go to squeaking your brakes &gt;&gt; cuz I charge thee by Jesus Christ that you turn these people loose. Now you might saying, "Brother, you're just reading." No, I'm believing. &gt;&gt; I'm not reading something just to read it. &gt;&gt; I'm believing. &gt;&gt; What I'm reading is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm believing it with all my heart, &gt;&gt; with everything that's within me. &gt;&gt; That when I read this, whoever needs deliverance in this place will receive deliverance in this place. And Satan, you might as well go to squeaking your brakes cuz I charge thee by Jesus Christ that you turn these people loose through the world, throughout the world, wherever this message may go. Oh, I'm [screaming] so glad that this message came my way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I can go free. I can be free. Hallelujah. Wherever this message may go, turn them loose. I claim them that they are bought that they are not their own. They are bought with a price. They are the royal seed of Abraham, the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thou filthy, dirty, stinking hypocrite, deceiver of men, leading them blindly into the ditches of hell. Turn them loose. I charge thee by the living God by the sacrifice of his son Jesus that you turn them loose that their souls may be charged with the with his blessings and with his presence &gt;&gt; that they might possess the gates of every enemy. &gt;&gt; You've got them waiting for this. Hallelujah. You've got them waiting for this that or the other or some holy touch or something else. But I'm saying you're going to lose your hold. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad I believe this message, brother. &gt;&gt; I am so glad that I am not that that I didn't stay in the in the Pentecostal church where I grew all the way till I was 15 years old. &gt;&gt; I received the message. My dad received the message when I was 12. And I began to read the books when I since I was 12. And I wasn't sure about all of that, but something in my heart, something in my heart just I don't know. I don't know about this man, you know, it sounds weird what he's saying, &gt;&gt; but there's something in here &gt;&gt; that makes my heart quiver. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That makes me skip a beat once in a while. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the living God &gt;&gt; turn them loose in the name of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; let them people go. May the power of God, the understanding of the word as they are washed this morning by it. May the understanding of keeping God's word and his promise and his promises true, a hold that cannot be broken by Satan. May each one lay a hold of that promise, &gt;&gt; saying, "This is it. I'm holding on to it. &gt;&gt; God made the promise. &gt;&gt; I'm the seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; How can I doubt his promise &gt;&gt; and move right on &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. [applause] &gt;&gt; I don't need to pray. &gt;&gt; I already prayed. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Cuz that prayer &gt;&gt; is powerful. &gt;&gt; That prayer is powerful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you didn't believe it, go back home and read it again. &gt;&gt; Because I was I was asking, Lord, what can I say? And the whole morning, the whole day, I was like looking at this, looking at that, looking at old sermons. You know, you sermons pile up and I kind of look at them like, hm, maybe this is good for that brother or that sister. No, I'm just saying. But but I pray I said, "Lord, Lord, give me something. &gt;&gt; Give me something not that can touch the people, but that can touch me &gt;&gt; because it touch if it touches me, then I know it's going to touch somebody else, &gt;&gt; you know, and and you know, my my my wife, my poor wife, she puts with me a lot, and she was she was there with me the whole day, and she was trying to have conversations with I was like, "Mm, no, no, not right now. No, they're going to talk about that stuff later." But once I began to read this, she didn't realize. But all of a sudden, something fell in that in that room. I was holding my tears. I was crying to the Lord, but I felt his presence. &gt;&gt; So I know this is the truth. Go back and read that prayer &gt;&gt; and believe it with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; Listen. Listen. It's not vain repetitions. &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan whisper that to your heart, to your mind. That's the say of the Lord right there. &gt;&gt; Read it. Believe it &gt;&gt; for your life, &gt;&gt; for the life of your children, &gt;&gt; for the life of your house. &gt;&gt; I even challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ to read it out loud in your house. &gt;&gt; To play it on the tape &gt;&gt; and tell Satan, "Look at this, Satan. &gt;&gt; Look at this promise. &gt;&gt; You have no hold over me. You have no hold over my family. You have no hold over my children because the Lord Jesus Christ has delivered us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the musician could come, I tell you, I can listen to brother Serger all day long. &gt;&gt; I I I certainly enjoy that. uh you know &gt;&gt; we we often time forget that the word is our weapon. &gt;&gt; You know what it's it's the very overcoming weapon that's been given to us and and we have to know it to know what he says. We have to know what to read it. We have to become one with it. You it's it's not a mental exercise of memorizing but it's to know what the promise says about you. Th this word the barbam says in this end time we have received the full entire revelation the opening of the seals we have receive the entire interpretation of the bible so so this is not what was it's not a portion it's the entirety of it has been made known unto us why because we need to be overcomers and we need the whole word of god to overcome with if one word can raise Jesus from the dead, what would the whole word of God do? &gt;&gt; And and so that's why when the Holy Spirit is coming, it's not to quicken your thinking. It's to quicken the word. I &gt;&gt; If there's no word in there, it's going to quicken frustration. It It's not going to quicken frustration. I'm trying to say, it's not going to quicken your idea of it. No. The Holy Spirit is looking for the word. The Holy Spirit lives by the word. The Holy Spirit is there to take the word and made it a reality to the believer. &gt;&gt; So we need to feed the word so we can be [music] quickened by that word and become that word. &gt;&gt; So so it's very critical. It's not oh I I you know like I I love what he said. You you bored read. You tired read. I it don't matter whatever situation you are in read the word of God. Play the word of God. Play that message. Let it be let let it be filling up your mind every time. Don't let any space for anything else to get in. &gt;&gt; Because when when when time temptation will come, you will only speak that which is in you. [music] &gt;&gt; If it's frustration, frustration will come out. But you want that word to remain in there. We want to be acquainted. It [music] he will come and take that word and quicken it. That's what we desire if we can all stand. [music] I I really enjoyed it and I trust within our hearts we can say Lord quicken the word in my heart. [music] You know, and let me say this. He talked about the test but says the test is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you. &gt;&gt; The test is there to prove which one is real, which one is not. &gt;&gt; And and I don't want to find out if I'm real at the end. I want to find out if it's real here. I want to find out the word will work here. I want to find out what's in my heart now. I don't want to find out later down the road. And the word will come and the test is to prove that which is in you. And and often time we we look at we have a reaction like oh what just happened? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; What you realize the word that's been planted in your heart came and a situation came and you just cry aba father and and you see him come on the scene and show himself. That's what we desire. We this [music] word was given to us not so it could be something that we could just come in externally. No, we become one with it as we listen and hear it and eat it. It's not a book on the shelf that we put and you know and we say, "Oh, I have a Bible." And and you just pick it up when it's service time. No, it's something that you become one. You become so acquainted with it. That everything it is you [music] are. And you know that I'm reading about myself. I am reading about I'm letting this word become my reality. Amen. [music] Let's just sing that. Oh, and [singing] you're alone are all I need. Oh, for you hold [singing and music] my destiny. Oh, and you are [singing and music] all I are all I need, Lord.

Let the [music] word be quickened in our hearts and that which was spoken, Lord, and that we may go out of here with that word [music] full within our hearts. Amen. Brother Tim Sal, if you could just come and dismiss us. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. I must say I got what I was looking for tonight. Not what I was expecting, [music] but it it's exactly what I needed. Let's bow our heads. Gracious and kind heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, for the atmosphere that's been created here, Lord. those that may be halting between two opinions. Maybe they can't muster enough faith to believe. Lord, you've made us believers tonight. [music] Lord, as a brother read that prayer and the prophet said, "Wherever this tape may go, [music] &gt;&gt; it found a resting place here tonight. Lord, we claim the promise. We claim the benefits [music] of being the recipients of who he was talking to, being the ones that the members of the bride of Christ. Lord, may we step up to that place. Lord, we don't want to live live below our means and [snorts] under the shadow of the footsteps of the devil, but Lord, we want to claim every benefit, every overcoming power that you've given us, Lord. Every weapon that's our disposal, Lord, it's May we use it, [music] benefit from it, Lord. Lord, as we go from this place, may we just take these things in our hearts and our minds, Lord, we can once again just intend to do more for your kingdom. Lord, to read more, to pray more, [music] to draw closer to you, Lord. It's a benefit to us and all those around us. Lord, [snorts] there's many needs amongst us. Lord, may we just bear the burdens and put them before you, combine our faith, Lord, [music] and know that you'll answer according to your word and your will. Lord, we pray that each of us as we leave here can be strengthened. We can be [snorts] just overjoyed, Lord, in our hearts and in our minds, our spirits, Lord, be lifted up for having been in this service. We thank you for Brother Sergio's effort tonight, Lord. ask you just refill him and bless him. Lord, [snorts] just keep us all to the appointed time.
