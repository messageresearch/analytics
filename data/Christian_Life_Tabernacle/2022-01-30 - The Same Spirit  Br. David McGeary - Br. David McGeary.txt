========================================

[Music] surrendering my [Music] earth [Music] us remembering [Music] oh [Music] [Music] this is [Music] our gracious father to surrender to you fathers to surrender to your word father we ask that you bless those that have come out tonight to fellowship around your word father to make the sacrifice to come right back to the house of the lord we ask that you give them a special blessing for their effort father bless your word to us this evening we pray in jesus precious and wonderful and holy name amen amen god bless you tonight uh just a few of us out to the house of the lord but that's usually the cream of the crop amen and you can make butter out of cream amen and cakes and cookies and all that stuff i can't eat anymore so but we just want to fellowship around the word just kind of look at a few scriptures and and point out a few things and i found the scripture i was looking for this morning so i'd like to use it as a text if we could and it's found in second corinthians the third chapter so let's turn to second corinthians the third chapter and uh read there and and i think this is a great uh a scripture and a great chapter we're gonna stop um at a certain point but if you go into it uh paul goes on to explain the the glory of the law versus the glory of the spirit that we we're going to stop at a a place right here after the sixth verse and he says now he says do we begin again to condemn ourselves or need we as some others epistles of condemnation to you or letters of condemnation from you ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men so paul never there was pointing to anything other than life as being the representation of what that he taught so he's not saying you're not reading it in a letter you're not reading it here but you are living what i preached and therefore that's life and so he says ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us i like that word don't you manifestly in other words it showed up it manifested it was real people see you they see what we teach they see you they see what we believe they see you they see what we stand for boy don't you hope that we can do that for our messenger amen and he says ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god that's the part we want to just fellowship about the epistle wasn't written with ink it was written by the spirit of the living god not in tablets of stone or we could say not in books you you understand there are on the bookshelf in the in the christian bookstore he says not written on tablets of stone but in fleshly tabernacles of the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward amen that's the trust that we have in christ is that by his spirit he's writing this word on the tablets of your heart and manifesting it to where that you become written epistles read of all men that men by looking at you in the flesh conceit what god has written amen and not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our suff our sufficiency is of god who hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen father bless your word and your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated so well so we're we're talking about and and and i don't really have a title for our sermon but my thought to you is simply let's not let the message become letter you know not letting the word become letter and so that's what our our our thought is i'd like to read this statement that the prophet of god made in the message the world's falling apart he says there's only one thing that ever did begin that never did begin there's only one thing that never did begin and that was god therefore the only way we can ever live eternally is to have god's own life in us and that's eternal life because the only way that you can have eternal you can't get eternal life from any other source than something that always was eternal because anything that has a beginning will have an end and the only thing that didn't have a beginning was god and god expressed himself in his word and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us therefore that was a great promise so jesus knew he had that life in him so he knew that he that he could lay his life down and take it up again because he had something inside of him that he knew could take it up again and that's why paul gives us the great hope he says if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you it will also do for you what it did for him amen it will also quicken your mortal body so you don't have to worry if you have that spirit in you and you have that life in you and you're a possessor of that life then you know that that life only has one end and the end of that is to live forever because that can't die oh and then we we could just go on and on into how we were in that word and how we're in a part of that world and that's why he could write our name on the lamb's book of life and nothing could put it on or nothing could take it off because of the great eternal part of god but what we're dealing with now because we're dealing with us possessing a weapon that can withstand the enemy in our day because we're in a battle life is a constant warfare and and if satan can't make the word of god none effect he'll make you of none effect has no man lighteth a candle and put it under a bushel basket but he likes the candle that that light might shine and and that many might find the way so he said in another place you are the salt of the earth if you lose your savor or if you lose your attraction because you you are down trodden and and then you you have no joy in your heart and you're you just kind of life has just got you so burdened or you've got so consumed with your own problems that that it forces you into your own little world and and that's what satan tries to do if he can't make the word of none effect he'll make you have none of that and we and we want to be effectual we want to have the effectual working of the gospel in our lives that's what we want to do we want to be written epistles read of all men so paul said i didn't come here to minister the letter you know not of the letter so he wants he's talking about something else that's greater than the letter so he said he says the only way god's own life in us eternal life god separated himself among us and gave us his spirit like he did on pentecost and was seen seen in the symbols of fire from the pillar of fire and it separated itself among the people to give his own life out out to the people and through this the mind of christ should be operating among us through this the mind of christ should be operating through us so we understood this morning by the word of god that satan is battling for our minds because if and we touched on a little bit that that reasoning is contagious so if if if we become the oracles not of god but of the article or oracles of satan whether it is doubt or or or or whether it is a confusion or disbelief or even our own uh lack of understanding if if if we speak and we we we talk and we express thoughts that aren't the mind of god then really we're preaching his gospel and certainly we don't want to be ministers of his gospel and we don't want our lives to minister of of his gospel and so we understand that that that's what it should come down to and through this in other words through god departing his spirit into his children through this one way this one way that god has the one way that he has to make us able ministers the one way he has to make us written epistles there's only one way that god has and that's the imparting of his spirit his life being imparted to the people and through this the mind of christ should be operating among us so the only way the mind of christ is going to be operating through us is by his spirit the only thing that interferes with that is our mind and that's why you know okay you can preach the gospel forever one of the hardest things it'll ever be to get the people to do is wait on the lord i am not a good waiter and i don't mean serving food i mean i i set a goal and i press and i push that might be the irish in me i don't know what it is i'm a fighter for causes it's just though the way that we have it through it all you've got to know that everything's in god's timing and his place and and he'll get it done but i believe he loves to see your heart but anyway it's by this way that the mind of god operates amongst us so there's no other way so if we just want to go back a little bit this morning touch on a few scriptures and just have a time in the lord and so we we talked this morning that that we know there's an enemy and he's fighting for our mind and he says he says he says and you must be trained when you meet him he's talking about the devil you got to be trained when you meet the devil well the first train if you have to have is what we had this morning you got to know what your weapon is now he's studying all your tactics right he knows that if you're a christian the first thing you're going to throw to him is the what the word and you notice this morning when eve said he said he didn't stop there he kept shooting and shooting and shooting and trying to find a hole trying to create a reasoning trying to create a doubt that's why our messenger told us this morning he says something he oh there is no holy spirit well okay you're an unbeliever you know okay it's not for you it's for me and you keep on going even when the children of israel were coming out of egypt but represented the bondage of sin the word of god by promise coming to them taking them to a journey to a promised land the one thing he told me to do is don't stop along the way don't fight with them don't fuss with them if what did they do if they ended up arguing with them and fussing with them and ended up marrying them and they got all involved with them along the way and that's what satan wants us to do he wants us to forget that we're on a journey we're just strangers he'll we're priggling strangers we're just traveling through this world is not my home i'm a just traveling through it's hard to do that because there's so many enticing things along the way to get us to stop and that's what he said he said he actually makes reason appealing and there's he's trying to give value to his lie and just remember this guy's motive his motive was to exalt himself above all the stars and to sit on the throne as god sits on the throne and to be worshiped that's what that's what he's after that's what he wants us to join in on that's what he's trying to get us to do is to enter into his temple and so we we see that he says not by psychology not trained in education or letter but trained by the holy spirit amen so this spirit that he's going to give us that is going to make us have his mind is the great tutor it's the tutor it's the trainer of us it's going to train us and many times we think well i get the holy spirit i'm filled with the spirit of god now i possess all power and all wisdom you know i'm going down to the hospital and i'm going to walk down the hallway and they're going to be coming out of their beds to all all over i'm going to meet every devil you know what i mean and just cast them out you know i mean all of a sudden you know i'm i'm all ready to go well you can put a 357 magnum in the hand of a three-year-old what do you think is going to happen someone's going to get shot something's going to get busted you know what i mean though he's got he's got to tutor us he's got to train us he's got to raise us up because he who is faithful in little is faithful and much i always love these guys i'm maybe i'll get on my soapbox for a few minutes all these guys they they they want to uh they want to have some sort of ministry they want to do something but when you ask them how many people have they led to the lord how many people have they sat through and prayed with and and watched the spirit of god come down at the end and convert them i mean are they so convinced they're concerned about the lost because real spirituality is evident in those that are concerned about the loss now i i i watched something last week that right before i left for my mother's house that really thrilled my heart and i don't believe the young man would mind me telling the testimony but i i was having some drywall work done in my bathroom at the house so i had brother gyrus come to do it and he brought his brother-in-law which would be his wife's brother and he came over and she asked me she said on the phone she said would you talk to him about the lord and i thought well what an admiral request you know and she proceeded to let me know how messed up he was you know he's smoking pot well i already know a god that can deliver from pods so that didn't shake me and and this you know and after that you know he didn't seem like as bad as cases she thought you know but if it just so happened that we sat down at the table and began to talk it and and you know a little bit of a testimony we begin to talk with them and and so here's a guy that knows about god but he's just not living it right and we begin to just fellowship and the spirit of god began to come around us and we we talked we talked about it and and i asked him i said well has anybody ever talked to you about the lord he said not like this you know and so we got done talking i said let's just pray together i said you've got to look down inside of you and see if there's something inside of you that's hearing the word of god and we prayed there and together and then i went on my trip and sure enough this morning he comes running up to me in the parking lot and the guy's just got a grin on his face and he says i'm in church and you can ask leslie he was so excited he says hey i'm here i'm in church this is awesome i really like this he said you know he said the prayer really helped amen and you know i i'm not saying that i had a great motive like oh i'm going to lead this guy to the lord you know his sister asked me to talk to him about the lord and i was standing around looking for the opportunity seeing it and somehow we just ended up at the table because they had to wait for the sheetrock to dry and we talked and it didn't appear nothing had happened but the word germinates the seed if that gene of god is in there then that word brings that gene to light that the gene of god where does the gene of god come you get like your father's gene right you i have the characteristics of my father if you saw pictures of my father you'd see pictures of me and vice versa and we could take this in all of our lives that we've got those natural virtues well those come from the genes of our parents the genetics well god's got a genetic and his genetic is his word that's the gene of god is the word in you and if and brother bran said if that word gets planted in the proper condition it'll come to life but the letter could kill that very person but the word of god the spirit of god brought it to life and so i was talking and he's really happy and he's excited him and he enjoyed the word and we know he think he understands that there's been battles to come but he tasted something that was greater than what he tasted before so if satan makes sin appealing how much more does god have to make his word appealing and that's what lets you know who you are is what what what appeals to you you know what what what draws you what's greater we're all tempted by sin we all make mistakes a man who says he hasn't sinned is a liar but we have someone that makes petition for us before the father and it covers our mistakes and trains us and teaches us look we've got to be trained and i just thought nice and i looked at him i said well i says i says i guess your sister can't be on your back anymore he says yeah that's one of the best parts of it but he was excited about what god did for him and and what was beautiful is you knew that it wasn't the letter wasn't ministered but life was minister and because life was ministered it turned into life okay and i'm anxious to see the great life that he'll have in the lord jesus the power to live through trials and tests and act and everything something that holds in the cliff of the storm it's a anchor in the rock you know it'll bring you through your mistakes it'll bring it through your failures it'll bring you through the things you regret that you never what you could do you can look back on your history and be ashamed but he only sees as far as the blood and it's beautiful so he says not trained but trained by the holy spirit god's power in his word so paul said here that i'm not a minister of the letter but of the spirit so i'm not a minister of the knowledge of the word or the truth of the word or of the doctrinal or dogma placing of the word of god what i'm ministering is the power of the word of god in other words what the word of god can do i'm not just not ministering what it is or what it was or or uh where it was in history and and everything and that's like us preaching about jesus yesterday well what good is jesus yesterday if he's not the same today and what good is it if we can't trust him for tomorrow so paul says he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same look he's not ministering the letter we are not ministering malachi 4 5 as william branham have coming in the 60s and opening the seals that's not what we're ministering that's history but what we're ministering is what he restored that's what we're ministering we're ministering the the faith that was restored the faith of our fathers that was restored to bring them to the gate called beautiful and say silver and gold have i none but that which i have i will minister to you that's what we're talking about it isn't to get people to see that brother brandon was a prophet every tv commentator joyce myers teaches that william branham was a prophet and she obviously didn't get the power she got the power of the hair clippers and the paint and the jewelry and to be out of order you know what i call that don't you the power of jezebel who had the messenger's head cut off see that's not what we're ministering because if we just minister the fact that you need to accept william branham is the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 and that he came in our day and he was elijah the prophet then you're ministering the letter satan believes that and he fears and trembles but so that's like admitting the guy walking up in the gray suit with the bag over his shoulder that your dog barks at is the mailman there goes the mailman that's the mailman he delivers the mail he's vindicated he's got a patch on his arm that says u.s mail he comes in the rain and the snow and the sunshine you know wind rain or snow he delivers the mail that's the mailman let me tell you about the mailman when the mailman started it started back when people moved to the west and they sent a pony back and forth and and they all can and he's the first pony express rider you know and all that stuff what good's the mailman if you never get any mail i don't care if the mailman ever comes to my house all he does is gives coupons for my wife to use to spend money i never got nothing in there from him i wanted bills i don't even think he's a deliverer of good news so why should i have a whole commentary about the mailman and that's what i'm saying if we're not careful we let the message become letter and and paul says i didn't minister letter to you but i ministered spirit and and that's what he said and then we'll just read this statement down a little farther which was in paragraph 32 he said he says and when an unclean spirit has gone out of the man he walks in dry places returning back then bringing sever seven other devils with him now the reason that happens is because a lot of people leave it there now i know we we're wanting to go forward aren't we i mean we're building a building by god's grace that everybody in here will only fill up the first two rows so we're going to have to have something a lot more genuine to attract the unbelievers because the so-called believers don't even come to church anymore so we're ready to go to the highways and byways aren't we but what are we going to take there we've got to take life and life more abundant we've got to take the power of the resurrection with we've got to talk take something that's that's genuine so in other words you can tell somebody about the message you can get them maybe to come out of their denomination but if they never go on to get the power and life that brother branham was restoring if if they don't get the restoration of the weapon then they'll walk in dry places and they and and that's what they do and then they end off worse off than they were in the first place don't just leave it there and if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're going to be worse off than ever so there's oh there's something to go on to and we we talked about that that we went on and said that we know that we've got to have the the power so we understand that paul he revealed he ministered not the letter but the spirit because the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life and so what he revealed was the word now it's not letter word what what it is it's revealed word right wasn't it in matthew 16 17 i i believe that uh you see if i have that just right here you know the scripture by heart i'm sure but matthew 16 17 says this wise and that and they said unto him and he said unto him but whom say ye that i am and and so that's that's what people are doing so everybody's telling you who christ was what he taught what he preached and that's why we have what 900 different denominations but he goes on to say and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art doubt simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven so in other words you didn't get this from man so this is the source the source was the father in heaven so that's the source and why does he have to be the source because he's the only thing that has eternal life so now look at really as we read this scripture in the light of what that we've been talking about today he says unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church in other words upon the rock of revelation in other words god showing you and quickening to you and revealing to you this is what i'm going to make our church on so paul didn't preach he preached the revealed word or the quicken word and what does quick and mean means brought to life so he preached the word brought to life can i say it a different way or the word brought into our lives that that's what he is preaching in other words not living not leaving the word here as a text or as a letter but that word now dwelling in us amen and i like as we read this he said he said upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it there he is he went full circle right we're going to be in a battle right so he gave us something that the enemy that fortified us that the enemy couldn't break through but it wasn't letter word it was quickened word it was revealed word that's what it was that he couldn't fight against now he can fight against the letter anybody want to get in a good letter fight we'll just call the church a christ guy they live for a good religious argument they'll talk to you about works and they'll put the scriptures together in a way that you're going what what bible are you reading man they got a prophet of god said don't you get in the argument with the good baptist he'll tie you in not because we're not ministering letter word we're ministering revelation noah couldn't minister letter because the letter said it wasn't going to rain you can't minister the baptism of the holy spirit to the church of christ because they believe the days of miracles is fast they believe that he did the work at calvary and if you accept it you don't have to go no farther so they decided not to take john 17. right out of their bible or john 14 also just take it right out of their bible so we're not talking about a word that's a letter word we're not talking about a teaching we're not just talking about all the wonderful and forgive me for this expression but i want to make my point and i trust the lord will forgive me but it's not all the wonderful one-liners that brother branham had are all the little stories it goes beyond that those were to attract your attention that was him casting the net and pulling us in but he was trying to get us to the point where we understood that we could take the same word he took right that's what he said this morning and defeat satan on the same grounds any place anytime anywhere that that's what he wants he wants us not to have the letter of it but he wants us to have the power of it the word of it and the only way you're going to get that word is by revelation it's the quicken word the word made alive to us and that's what people have done they took brother branham as the letter as a fulfillment of malachi 4 5 the fulfillment of luke 17 30. they they took all those things and then when they were challenged they fell apart they had no answer they had no answer because they never had the revelation there is no answer for unbelief there's no answer for unbelief there's no answer for someone that doesn't have revelation because all they're left with is reasoning and that's what they're stuck with you've got to pity them so it's there it's their revealed word that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it's not the letter because the letter killeth he can prevail against the letter and that's what they did they went out they just didn't they just didn't go out from amongst us but they turned back around and tried to kill us thinking that they were doing god a service you take people like rod bergen and lance larue and tim humes and and and uh jeff what's ever his name from ohio they're fulfilling that scripture they're trying to kill you thinking they're doing god a service they're sincere oh you need to be delivered you need to be saved you need to come out from amongst this cult you can't explain the cloud you can't explain how he could be here and there i wonder when philip got over to that revival and just said hey i just baptized the guy over down here on the way to the desert down here man we had a revival right there i opened the word of god to him and he took the word of god we went down to the water and baptized him and they're saying well wait a minute that's 300 miles away how could you how could you be in houston and be on the mountain and how could you be a how could you how could you do how do you feel phil if you're blowing my mind here i can't i can't get a hold of this thing what are you talking about i'm talking about transforming power to do the unspeakable amen the unchanging god working in unexpected ways that's right see all zakat was malachi 4-5 they never understood the message they saw he was a prophet by his works but they never read the letter that empowered you that's all they do now they're just trying to kill our influence everywhere all bold you know going having anti-brother branham conventions you still see they have no life without the message they're still preaching the message but from the dead side they still don't have a gospel without the message so they still don't have life now they're just preaching brother not a prophet brother brahm didn't do this you can't explain this brother brown is here i don't believe this i don't believe that yeah how would you like to been born again in phillips revival how many miles did he say 200 or something he was went right on preaching wherever he landed he just went on preaching now when you can talk to that ethiopian and explain how he was baptized the same day without jets he didn't have captain james to fly him in us cessna citation over there he had the same power you tell me how jesus could go to hell and preach the souls that were lost how many believes that this message has been preached to a lot of lost souls i don't care do you understand because that we're not the ministers of the letter we're not trying to prove the letter we're not trying to prove the history what we're trying to prove is that he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] and so we find out that the only thing that the gates of hell can't prevail against is the word that's quickened to you right faith is the evidence or revelation is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen that that's what that's what it is so if you've got revelation and the word's been quickened to you then you have what defeat if you just go to him with the scriptures and with the letter and i remember earl williams sharing with me one time before he went to be with the lord that he said you know i i i went to pick brother branham up to take him to coffee with these ministers and uh so he came out and he jumped in my car and we were headed to such and such place sambo's or someplace to have coffee with these ministers and he said i looked at him and said brother branham aren't you taking your bible and you know and i i and what was beautiful of that story to me was you you saw earl's mindset you better bring the letter and brother bram said ah earl he says their bible reads the same as mine does i thought oh my there it is he had the spirit of the word he didn't need the letter he he wasn't going to argue scriptures with them he wasn't going to argue letter with them he was going in truth and so that's the thing that doesn't prevail so don't become under the misguidance of the idea that you're just going to take your idea of anything and make it work you've got to have it quickened made alive to you and the only thing that does it's the spirit of god and you've got to be trained in waiting for the spirit of god to make it alive to you you don't have to take thought let's read in john 14 as we begin to close this evening now we know as we're going to read saint john the 14th chapter starting with the 16th verse now we know that god never speaks a word without it having a purpose how many knows that he never speaks a word without having its purpose and that purpose has to be revealed or made known to you personally for your life in other he spoke it now if you take the letter of it i watch people use scriptures they take one scripture and they base all of their baptism on one scripture well there's water blood and spirit and these three agree in one and the other ones and they take that one scripture and they try to base everything on it they'll take one scripture and you must confess that jesus that you're a sinner and jesus christ is lord and savior and they build a whole system on that one thing but it's letter and we don't want to take this message and make it letter and i'm afraid that's what has happened to us a lot is we're teaching what brother random said and we're teaching the doctrines of things the doctrines of water baptism the doctrine doctrines of this which paul says let us move on perfection because those things we shall do if god prevents but there's something else that he's got for us something that he's trying to put into the church that will quicken them out of this world the rapture is not a date it's a condition so let's read here in john 14. let's start with the 11th verse believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake now look at the revelation there would you rather believe him because what he did or he believed him because of who he was i heard this song the other day the greater vision said it wasn't because he calmed the waves or the wind listened to him it wasn't what he did but it was who he was but because of who he was he did what he did can you if you if we keep trying to approach it through the letter we'll never come to the realization of who that we are because we don't do things by the letter we do it because who we are and that's what's quickened to you and we read it this morning he gives every believer the authority to cast out devils not be by the letter but by the authority that was given to him by the quickening power so let's just read these as we begin to close this evening believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if he loved me keep my commandments look he said i skipped the verse and if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it for if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you oh i would have loved to bend in that upper room how many people miss it that are trinitarians and think a third person came down out of heaven when it was the very person he said i i i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again another scripture and i'll be with you even in you till the end how do you think it was when that upper room when they're praying and all of a sudden the pillars of fire start to show up and the wind starts to blow i think you ought to make it a great be as dramatically as you can you know what i mean because that was the biggest in your face devil that that happened because he thought he put him away right he thought he done burying them he thought he was off the scene and now here he comes back and he breaks himself up and now he's got 120 of them that's going to spread the world like a plague we're satan's plague you've heard of clover 19 when we're john 3 16. as many who believeth on him gave you power to be the sons and daughters of god here we are satan here he is in me back again doing the same works that he did when he was here on the earth here he is he's right here inside of me you think they got a different anointing no he said can you be baptized with the baptism where i am baptized with and they're just looking at a man because he was a man and they said i believe we can and he says i believe it too because that's what i come for i'm going to go to calvary i'm going to pay the price for sin they're going to put me in the grave because that's the last thing that i've got to overcome on your behalf is the grave because you've all been condemned to death so i to the grave so i'll pay the price for your sins could you imagine if that's all the further he went he said then i'm going to go into the grave and i'm going to come out of the grave that i can leave all the captive free i can overcome death hell and the grave and now i can bring the same quickening power back to the church that will raise them up too that's the beauty of it what does it do to preach jesus died on the cross and he forgave your sins and that he went in the grave and rose up again if he couldn't impart to you the same life to take you out of the grave paul never preached the letter he preached if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwelling you it'll do for him for you what it did for him that's the gospel that's what we preach we preach resurrection and life not only the forgiveness of sins but we preach the indwelling power of the spirit of god we preach the baptism of the holy spirit we don't preach that it's manifested in emotion we believe it's preaching the manifestation of the power over sin and the devil get behind me satan so we read i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter and he that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth them not because they got to see it you know why they got to see it because there's something that gives you sight beyond eyesight and that's revelation they can't believe it because god hasn't revealed it to them we don't walk by sight we walk by revelation he said neither know with him but ye ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you oh my just think in that upper room when he showed up in spirit form and they knew he was there they could sense his presence and his being being there they knew it was him just like you could feel the presence of god sometimes in the anointing they knew it was him and they all sat there and all of a sudden he started coming in each one of them and all of a sudden they knew he was in them they knew they had him with him they knew he kept his word that's the baptism is the person of jesus christ being made known to you personally i know he lives in me not an anointing not some other thing not a third person but him and you looked at yourself he said oh i'm so filthy i'm so dirty that's not your choice it's not your choice to make yourself unworthy it's your choice to accept the pardon because he cleansed you from all unrighteousness and let him come in so we read he said i will not leave but i will come to you a little while and the a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also and then we could read on but let's just step down to the 26th verse but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you so that we understand now that it's not an idea of studying everything that uh everything that the scriptures uh say and get the word and all that because we already know what the comfort's gonna do is he's gonna bring to our remembrance the things that he taught in others he's gonna bring to us and quicken to us and make us known to us and make the word living to us because you can't store it up in your mind i remember the prophet of god at 55 years ago saying i used to have all these scriptures memorized but now i got to write them down man i'd hate to rely on my memory but there's only one thing you can trust that he's given me something that will quicken these things to me and bring him to my remembrance and if i have that i have it all if i have one cup of the ocean i have all the ocean and let's close with this thought so we're talking about that he says god knew this so he sent to the church that so satan would not outsmart them a place to be fortified he sent them the holy ghost and the church does not claim to be smart they just came to believe so he gave him something which was the holy spirit the spirit of life now i want to read this last thing out of let me see if i have it here yes i think i have it well this is the world falling apart okay i'd like to read this in this is from the conflict between god and satan and he's he says he's talking to this he says so we have two classes today that's professing now listen close in closing we have two classes that's professing to be the bride of christ paragraph 207 the conflict between god and satan two classes of people that claim to be the bride of christ that's right and the bible speaks that there will be two classes that's right the wise version and the foolish ones is that right two classes the church says we are the church and they go out and have these great evangelistic campaigns bring the people into church the woman continue on with their way of doing the men continue on with their way of doing they never changed their doctrine they got it all wrote out and documented and set down and those accos apostle creeds and certain prayers and all these catechisms and everything that in everything that the methodist and baptist and presbyterians and catholics and all that read they got all their doctrine laid down they've got it all laid out there's no room for what revelation there's no room for it to be changed or quickened it's already spelled out it's already what we believe this is what this scripture means this is what this scripture means and paul said i didn't minister the letter i didn't minister a doctrine and things that were were etched in tablets of stone i didn't put it on parchment i put it in your heart if and if he and and so now he's saying this is what the conflict is he said it's all wrote out what they all read and they accept that catechism be some because some great man back behind said that it was right he might have been a great man he might have been right but it hasn't got the authority to say that because the bible is god's authority it is the written word of god and any man that adds one thing to it or takes anything from it the same shall be taken his part out of the book of life and that can't be done so now and we have two possessions and he goes on to read see they've got it all wrote out and can you imagine us thinking we got it all figured out we got it all laid out we know what we believe we know the seals have been open we know the lamb's book of life we know this we know that we all that we've got it all figured out we got it all laid out our doctrine doesn't change and it's we get to the place that god can't talk to us he can't reveal to us we can't be led of the spirit he's not going to lead us outside his word but he's going to lead us to manifest his word that we might glorify the father in heaven that we might be written epistles that we might show the same god that appeared in this generation in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. revelations 10 7 that the same spirit that was manifested in the son of man ministry for our day that that same spirit has come back to earth again that same spirit that was in jesus christ showing the signs to the jews came back again to show those same signs to the gentiles so god could be a just god and he imparts that same spirit into his elect lady that will lead them and guide them in all truth and righteousness so they don't turn this into a letter it's not something we believe it's something that's alive and leading us step by step every day of the world every day in this world that we live in god's word is being quickened to us so it's not what we read a lot of people read these i had a friend that just passed away his name was don furon he sent thousands of these to prisons every day in the prisons across the land people are reading these books there's been hundreds and thousands of messages sent out if that's what did it then we should have many many more times believer but you must be born again and so we've got to not we can't become letter we've got to become spirit and in truth we've got to be baptized with the same baptism he was baptized with we've got to have the same works that he had and then we know that it's resurrected from letter to life and isn't that your heart's desire i don't want it to be letter i you know i've been in the message i guess since the end of 1969 68 69 back in there um you know that's a long time i don't know let's just start with 70 70 80 90 2000 2010 2020. that's 50 some years i know a lot of what he said but i want what made him live the way he lived amen i want to recognize the devil at every one of his trip i want this word that's been stored out i want him to take it out of the storehouse quicken it and make it alive that it doesn't become a letter to me so lord richly bless you tonight to just uh we're really have just closed out our tape on does god ever change his mind about his word and meth sunday will pick up and move on to another message and start studying it out and looking at the group many great wonderful things that are hidden
