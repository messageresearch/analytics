[11:30] lord how except for your
[11:33] for your hand reaching down dealing with
[11:36] each one of us
[11:38] lord we would be no different than any
[11:40] anybody else out in this world
[11:42] struggling to find a way

[12:42] amen
[12:44] you want to go ahead and turn to psalm
[12:45] 119 this morning we're just going to
[12:48] continue
[12:50] reading through a little portion of that
[12:53] this morning
[12:55] we'll be starting in verse 57
[12:58] and you know as i was reading that
[13:00] portion of scripture this weekend there
[13:02] was a phrase in verse 57 that just
[13:05] spoke to me
[13:07] and it says this
[13:10] thou
[13:11] art my portion
[13:13] o lord
[13:15] you know webster's dictionary defines
[13:17] portion as a
[13:19] as an individual's part
[13:21] or share in something
[13:24] their lot their fate
[13:26] their fortune
[13:28] you know and i was just kind of
[13:30] meditating on that and that's
[13:33] kind of how life is
[13:35] you know there are some people their
[13:38] portion
[13:40] is to have great wealth
[13:42] and to
[13:43] collect
[13:45] vast fortunes and use that to
[13:47] build things and build names for
[13:49] themselves
[13:51] you know there are others who their
[13:52] portion is to have great influence
[13:54] to be able to build social networks and
[13:57] move great amounts of society in one
[13:59] direction or another
[14:01] you know there are those whose portion
[14:03] is to do great works
[14:05] maybe they
[14:07] drive
[14:08] causes and affect great change
[14:12] and then there are those whose portion
[14:14] might be great abilities might have
[14:16] skills whether it's in athletics or
[14:18] learning or music
[14:22] that's their portion
[14:24] that's the portion
[14:26] that's been given to them
[14:30] you know as david says in psalm 119 57
[14:33] there are those
[14:35] who the lord has given him given them
[14:38] himself
[14:40] as their portion
[14:42] that's their portion they may not have
[14:44] the wealth or the abilities or the
[14:46] influence or
[14:47] do great works but they have him
[14:50] that's been their portion
[14:52] that's been allotted
[14:54] to them
[14:56] he's given them himself
[14:59] you know david said in psalm 16 verse 5
[15:03] the lord
[15:05] is the portion of mine inheritance
[15:08] and my cup
[15:10] thou maintainest my lot
[15:14] while others might be enjoying a
[15:16] different portion in life
[15:18] for some
[15:20] the portion that they've been given is
[15:22] the lord
[15:24] you know when you think about how
[15:26] precious
[15:28] that is it says and
[15:30] as we'll read uh in psalm 119 it says in
[15:32] verse 59 i thought on my ways
[15:36] and turned my feet unto thy testimonies
[15:38] verse 60. i made haste
[15:40] and delayed not
[15:42] to keep thy commandments
[15:46] you think about how precious that is
[15:47] that we've been given him as our portion
[15:50] but it occurred to me how often as we
[15:54] kind of are living our lives
[15:56] we get
[15:57] focused on
[15:59] someone trying to collect someone else's
[16:02] portion
[16:04] we invest in trying to build wealth or
[16:07] hone our abilities or
[16:09] influence
[16:11] try to
[16:12] do great works
[16:14] borrowing from someone else's portion
[16:17] rather than
[16:19] appreciating the value of the portion
[16:21] that we've been given
[16:23] and we take the portion that we've been
[16:25] given and squeeze him into a little
[16:27] portion
[16:28] of our lives
[16:31] and so it was just kind of a reminder to
[16:32] me how important it was to realize the
[16:35] value of the portion
[16:37] himself
[16:38] that has been allotted
[16:40] to me
[16:43] you know it says in verse 61 the bands
[16:45] of the wicked have robbed me
[16:47] just an example of all those
[16:49] influences those voices that would try
[16:51] to rob me
[16:53] of my portion
[16:56] you know david in his prayer for
[16:58] deliverance in psalm 17 14 said from men
[17:01] which are thy hand o lord from men of
[17:03] the world which have their portion in
[17:05] this life and whose belly thou fill us
[17:07] with thy hid treasure they are full of
[17:09] children and leave the rest of their
[17:10] substance to their babes
[17:12] this is david crying out from for
[17:15] deliverance from those men that would
[17:17] have their portion in this life
[17:19] but i liked what he said in verse 15
[17:22] as for me
[17:24] i will behold thy face in righteousness
[17:28] i shall be satisfied
[17:30] my portion
[17:32] when i awake
[17:34] with thy likeness
[17:37] are you grateful for the portion
[17:40] that has been allotted to you
[17:42] in this life
[17:44] to think that he has given himself
[17:48] as a portion
[17:49] you know in my prayer just for myself as
[17:51] i was
[17:52] reading that that i would take care not
[17:55] to reduce
[17:56] my portion
[17:58] but embrace the full measure of the
[18:00] portion
[18:01] that he's allotted to me
[18:04] so let's just read that this morning
[18:05] it's just we're going to read those
[18:06] eight verses starting in verse 57
[18:09] it says thou art my portion o lord i
[18:12] have said that i would keep thy words i
[18:15] entreated thy favor with my whole heart
[18:17] be merciful unto me according to thy
[18:20] word i thought on my ways and turned my
[18:23] feet unto thy testimonies i made haste
[18:26] and delayed not to keep thy commandments
[18:28] the bans of the wicked have robbed me
[18:31] but i have not forgotten thy law
[18:33] at midnight i will rise to give thanks
[18:35] unto thee because of thy righteous
[18:37] judgments i am a companion of all them
[18:40] that fear thee and of them that keep thy
[18:43] precepts the earth o lord is full of thy
[18:46] mercy teach me thy statutes

[31:02] here praise the lord
[31:07] i got prostate cancer since 2018
[31:10] i felt uncomfortable and i always come
[31:14] to the altar to seek heal
[31:16] from the lord
[31:19] allow me to share to you
[31:22] a short coach
[31:24] from a chairman of brother burnham
[31:29] we believe that doctors help people
[31:33] i believe that god heals by medicine
[31:37] god heals
[31:39] by surgery
[31:42] god heals by understanding
[31:46] god heals by love
[31:49] just a little love goes a long way
[31:52] let somebody be all upset
[31:55] and just show them
[31:57] you care for them
[32:00] god heals by love
[32:03] god heals by prayer
[32:06] god heals by miracles
[32:09] god heals by his word
[32:12] god heals
[32:14] whatever source it is god heals by it
[32:18] it's god
[32:19] that heals
[32:21] for he said i am the lord that healed
[32:24] all thy diseases
[32:27] so all of it should
[32:31] work together
[32:34] and man in different ministries
[32:38] should work together for that see
[32:41] now
[32:43] but they don't do it
[32:45] because sometimes they're forbidden to
[32:47] take certain stance
[32:50] upon
[32:51] god's word
[32:52] because there are certain denominations
[32:55] doesn't permit them to do that
[32:58] but that doesn't stop the truth

[44:33] amen amen you believe your life is in
[44:37] his hands
[44:38] amen we'll play a little
[44:41] a portion of the message this morning
[44:43] that will
[44:45] uh settle that
[44:47] beyond a shadow of a doubt
[44:49] let's just approach them now in a word
[44:51] of prayer
[44:52] if there's a special request that you
[44:55] have
[44:56] on your heart and you would like
[45:00] the
[45:01] lord to grant that to you wasn't that a
[45:04] wonderful testimony
[45:06] of our brother
[45:07] being healed
[45:09] amen
[45:11] i remember praying with him and i knew
[45:14] he
[45:15] believed that god could do it
[45:19] you know he does those things so
[45:21] you too can have faith
[45:24] in what you're asking
[45:28] amen i
[45:29] uh
[45:32] cosman
[45:32] [Music]
[45:35] shared this testimony
[45:36] [Music]
[45:38] i believe it was a
[45:41] gentleman at his work
[45:43] his daughter became a
[45:46] ill and
[45:47] and she was sick and
[45:50] and she started bleeding internally and
[45:54] they they felt that
[45:56] she had a mass or
[45:59] something on one of her ovaries or
[46:01] some they felt it was cancer and
[46:05] and uh
[46:06] so he asked brother cosman if he would
[46:09] come
[46:10] pray
[46:11] for his daughter
[46:13] and so i believe that
[46:16] brother andrew and brother cosman
[46:19] went up isn't that just how the lord
[46:20] sends a mountain to and
[46:22] and they went into the hospital room and
[46:25] they begin to
[46:27] to
[46:29] share the word of god with her
[46:31] and begin to talk about the things that
[46:35] have been opened up to us and
[46:38] and she just sat there they said like a
[46:41] sponge absorbing it in there are other
[46:44] people in the room and he said the
[46:46] presence of the lord come down it felt
[46:48] like they were at church
[46:51] and they they prayed for her
[46:54] and they went and
[46:56] and then uh
[46:59] he gets the
[47:00] text back do you you have that text with
[47:03] you
[47:03] why don't you come here and read it
[47:08] i want you to read i hear this
[47:11] amen
[47:16] you can
[47:16] anything i didn't say right you just
[47:18] you'd fix
[47:22] no just like brother david had mentioned
[47:23] um
[47:25] you know
[47:26] um
[47:27] brother joe the employee that works for
[47:30] me just
[47:31] every time we talk we always try to
[47:32] bring the world around and so he just
[47:34] said if i can
[47:35] if i can ask anybody to come pray for my
[47:37] daughter would be you
[47:39] and so
[47:40] we just had faith and asked but andrew
[47:42] to come with us and
[47:44] and so
[47:46] we get to the room and
[47:49] you know you can tell that the presence
[47:51] of god was in the room
[47:53] and so
[47:55] we just started talking
[47:56] you know and the lord took over we just
[47:58] started getting into the word and we
[48:00] were just talking to her about the lord
[48:01] and you know she was sitting there in
[48:03] pain
[48:05] but even within that pain you can tell
[48:07] that there was something inside of her
[48:09] heart that were just asking for more
[48:10] than really what she was receiving
[48:12] and so um you know there was just the
[48:15] presence of the lord was heavily deep in
[48:17] there and then at the end we just ended
[48:19] up singing a song and such a sweet
[48:20] atmosphere
[48:22] and i believe lies were changed in that
[48:25] and so yesterday morning right before
[48:26] the men's breakfast ended um
[48:29] i i had a scripture on my heart i sent
[48:31] it to brother chase that's her husband
[48:34] and so he writes this right as we were
[48:36] finishing our our men's breakfast says
[48:38] great news everyone we just got
[48:40] christie's labs back
[48:42] and christy is cancer free
[48:45] it says thank you
[48:46] jesus it says thank you jesus that means
[48:49] no radiation no chemotherapy no cancer
[48:53] hallelujah thank you
[48:55] amen
[48:57] amen
[49:03] now
[49:04] with those testimonies let's approach
[49:07] the throne of god with faith
[49:10] believing that those things that you ask
[49:12] for
[49:14] you shall receive he can do for you
[49:16] exceedingly and abundantly
[49:19] above which you can ask her to nothing's
[49:21] impossible for god
[49:23] let us just once again approach his
[49:26] throne our heavenly father

[53:54] verse and
[53:59] and this
[54:00] is a good uh
[54:07] for what we want to fellowship around
[54:10] this morning

[54:13] rejoice
[54:14] in the good things of god amen
[54:17] isn't it a comfort knowing that he loves
[54:20] you
[54:21] you might not love him yet
[54:24] but he still loves you
[54:26] amen
[54:28] but as it is written
[54:30] i have not seen
[54:33] nor
[54:34] ear heard
[54:36] neither
[54:37] having entered into the hearts of men
[54:41] the things which god hath prepared
[54:45] for them
[54:47] that
[54:48] love him
[54:50] amen let us pray our gracious heavenly
[54:52] father
[54:54] lord we ask you to take control of this
[54:57] servant

[55:02] father may your word
[55:04] increase
[55:07] and may you enlighten our understanding
[55:11] and may we grow
[55:13] in faith
[55:14] we ask you to bless us now as we
[55:17] have this time of worship and service
[55:20] and fellowship with you in your word
[55:23] in jesus name we pray
[55:25] amen
[55:26] amen god bless you
[55:28] you may be seated this morning
[55:34] um
[55:35] we're going to
[55:37] play this morning
[55:42] 22 minutes out of the message called
[55:47] things that
[55:49] are to be
[55:51] but
[55:52] i
[55:54] i would like just to make a few comments
[55:56] maybe
[55:57] before and then maybe
[56:00] a few after
[56:03] but
[56:04] what's
[56:07] moving on my heart
[56:10] is i have a great desire to go forward
[56:13] in the gospel
[56:16] i believe that god has things for us in
[56:19] fact the word of god said
[56:22] it hasn't even entered into our hearts
[56:26] the things that god's prepared for us
[56:30] so that tells me that god has things
[56:33] prepared
[56:34] for us that there's there's things that
[56:38] lie ahead
[56:40] so you would agree
[56:43] with me i'm sure on that that we're just
[56:46] not looking back and we're just not
[56:50] sitting still
[56:52] waiting for a future
[56:54] event
[56:56] to
[56:57] uh take place in other words i've done
[57:00] everything that i can do i
[57:03] i'm uh
[57:05] i believe and now i'm just
[57:08] waiting it out
[57:11] and that would be good there's a portion
[57:14] of that that's true
[57:16] that we're redeeming the time but we're
[57:19] not redeeming the time without
[57:21] expectation
[57:23] we're not redeeming the time without an
[57:27] understanding
[57:29] and a motivation
[57:31] and a revelation and an encouragement
[57:35] and an excitement electricity
[57:39] if i could use that terminology
[57:42] that we are not just going into
[57:45] something that we don't understand
[57:48] but god has something prepared for us
[57:52] okay it's greater than
[57:55] what that
[57:57] we perceive now
[57:59] because it hasn't even entered into our
[58:02] hearts the things that god's prepared
[58:05] for us so if we sit back for a moment
[58:08] at and then our our faith can be
[58:11] uh
[58:13] elevated if i could use that
[58:16] to terminology
[58:18] uh
[58:19] that our faith can come to a place
[58:22] that is not limited to this world
[58:26] and so if you know if i had a title it
[58:29] would kind of be along those lines that
[58:32] our faith is not limited
[58:34] to this world and and to explain that a
[58:38] little bit farther is that
[58:40] uh we don't measure our faith is not
[58:43] measured
[58:45] by the effects or changes we see
[58:49] on this present world
[58:52] so
[58:54] our faith seems to be
[58:58] boxed in
[59:00] to
[59:01] the life around us so as we're down life
[59:04] road we come into obstacles and as we go
[59:08] down life's roads we find ourselves in
[59:10] situations
[59:12] and in circumstances and then we feel
[59:15] the faith by faith is to move
[59:18] this obstacle or my faith is to overcome
[59:23] this adversary and and now we're
[59:26] measuring everything by this present
[59:29] world
[59:31] our faith is only related to
[59:34] the world that
[59:36] is
[59:37] uh
[59:38] present tense
[59:40] that we're in and so our struggle
[59:43] only rises up to
[59:47] meet the occasions
[59:49] that are in our circumstance so i say i
[59:53] have faith
[59:55] because
[59:56] our brother
[59:58] santiago brother james we know that he
[1:00:02] has faith but because his faith
[1:00:05] overcame
[1:00:07] that
[1:00:08] cancer that was in him
[1:00:11] his faith in the word of god
[1:00:14] it was
[1:00:16] okay i hope you uh
[1:00:18] it were inspired the way that i was that
[1:00:20] he knew what the prophet said that god
[1:00:23] could use doctors to heal
[1:00:26] he knew what the prophet said so his
[1:00:28] faith was in what god said
[1:00:34] now and he put his faith in that
[1:00:37] circle
[1:00:38] and he went in with faith and by that
[1:00:41] that faith he he he was able to accept
[1:00:44] his healing and testify
[1:00:47] and and we prayed uh fulfilling every
[1:00:51] aspect of the scripture anointing with
[1:00:54] oil laying on of hands
[1:00:56] agreeing together so we did all the
[1:00:59] things that god asked us to do
[1:01:03] and now we see the result of that
[1:01:08] testimony was that the doctor said
[1:01:11] you're healed
[1:01:14] i stood up and started praising god
[1:01:19] hey amen
[1:01:21] i don't know i'm sure he had a good
[1:01:23] doctor most doctors are wonderful people
[1:01:26] my doctor always wants to talk to me
[1:01:28] about the lord
[1:01:31] and
[1:01:31] and
[1:01:33] but you know he didn't say oh doctor
[1:01:35] thank you for healing me
[1:01:39] amen he praised god
[1:01:41] now that's great faith
[1:01:44] and we want that faith that there is a
[1:01:46] faith
[1:01:48] beyond this world
[1:01:52] because in other words
[1:01:54] we can believe for things
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:58] aren't even
[1:02:00] understood yet
[1:02:03] it is so
[1:02:04] if you can see where my heart is is
[1:02:10] if my goal is to climb out of this world
[1:02:14] i want my faith to be out of this world
[1:02:18] i want to have out of this world faith
[1:02:21] not faith that just works in this world
[1:02:25] but of faith that works in the world
[1:02:27] beyond this world
[1:02:31] because that if i have faith in that
[1:02:34] world that's the faith that's going to
[1:02:36] take me
[1:02:37] to that world
[1:02:40] and and so as we we're going to
[1:02:45] listen to this
[1:02:47] uh message for 20 minutes this morning
[1:02:51] and
[1:02:52] and then expand on it as you see
[1:02:55] the prophet god's going to talk to us
[1:02:58] about
[1:02:59] the lord fixing his life is
[1:03:02] fixing
[1:03:05] his death was coming
[1:03:08] and his life was fixing to end
[1:03:13] and so he wanted his disciples
[1:03:17] to
[1:03:18] understand that his death was for a
[1:03:21] purpose
[1:03:23] and and and he said these things he said
[1:03:26] to him he says you believe in god
[1:03:32] believe also
[1:03:34] in me
[1:03:37] now because that was
[1:03:39] i want you to attend that
[1:03:41] he was asking them
[1:03:44] to believe something
[1:03:47] that in the sense was contrary to
[1:03:51] everything that they'd been taught
[1:03:54] now he's going to mention this i'm just
[1:03:57] bringing out what he's going to tell you
[1:04:01] and and so he said in my father's house
[1:04:06] are many mansions
[1:04:08] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:04:13] that where i am ye may be also
[1:04:18] and we want we we always we have that
[1:04:22] boxed in
[1:04:24] so that whole that scripture doesn't
[1:04:27] expand in us
[1:04:29] the the way that it should because it's
[1:04:33] limited in our thinking to the escape of
[1:04:37] this life
[1:04:39] and this world
[1:04:40] i'm just getting out of here
[1:04:43] but it goes beyond that
[1:04:46] but look what they were asked to believe
[1:04:48] he was asking jews who already knew that
[1:04:53] there was a god
[1:04:55] that was supernatural above all things
[1:04:58] and the one and only true god
[1:05:01] now he's asking them he says you believe
[1:05:07] in the father
[1:05:10] you believe in god
[1:05:12] believe also in me
[1:05:15] what
[1:05:16] a thing
[1:05:18] to ask
[1:05:21] you can't understand
[1:05:24] asking a jew that
[1:05:26] what that meant that he was asking
[1:05:34] i mean you and that's what god's always
[1:05:36] done
[1:05:39] he's always identified his believers
[1:05:44] by
[1:05:44] challenging them and asking them to
[1:05:48] believe something beyond the realms of
[1:05:52] this world
[1:05:58] to believe something if i could say
[1:06:01] out of this world
[1:06:03] i mean you take abraham
[1:06:07] what he asked abraham to believe
[1:06:12] you know okay it wasn't a question that
[1:06:14] god could do it but he came down and
[1:06:17] said abraham i'm asking you to believe
[1:06:21] i'm challenging you
[1:06:24] i'm challenging you
[1:06:27] to believe
[1:06:29] that you and your wife are going to have
[1:06:33] a son
[1:06:36] now that's what god does
[1:06:38] he challenges you
[1:06:42] i'll read the statement to you so you
[1:06:44] can
[1:06:45] it'll bless you we'll do that after we
[1:06:48] listen
[1:06:50] but he challenged abraham
[1:06:53] saying abraham believed now abraham
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:58] believed that god was able
[1:07:03] to perform that which he promised
[1:07:07] amen
[1:07:08] amen so
[1:07:10] we know we know the whole story of it
[1:07:13] but none of that was imputed to him
[1:07:16] there was no unrighteousness as imputed
[1:07:19] to abraham because he believed god
[1:07:23] believe it or not he believed god
[1:07:25] through his unrighteousness now i don't
[1:07:28] know if i could get away with
[1:07:31] trying to well maybe she would like that
[1:07:33] but trying to peddle a sister leslie off
[1:07:37] as my
[1:07:40] sister who's this woman well she's my
[1:07:43] sister
[1:07:45] why because if she's my wife i'm going
[1:07:48] to be killed
[1:07:49] that i wouldn't think that was a very
[1:07:51] righteous thing to do right
[1:07:54] but watch how god preserved this promise
[1:07:58] because abraham believed
[1:08:02] well you think that's pretty bad he does
[1:08:04] it again
[1:08:08] i mean if you wouldn't think that
[1:08:11] that abraham
[1:08:13] was
[1:08:17] a super saint
[1:08:20] i don't know all the things that went on
[1:08:22] in his life but i know one thing
[1:08:25] god challenged him to believe something
[1:08:27] and he believed it
[1:08:30] and god asked him to believe something
[1:08:33] now
[1:08:34] you look at moses what god asked him to
[1:08:37] believe
[1:08:40] he asked him to take a stick
[1:08:45] and go down and deliver
[1:08:47] thousands two million people
[1:08:50] out of egypt
[1:08:53] it's a great bible story isn't it
[1:08:56] we like to watch the movie and we think
[1:08:59] that's great in everything
[1:09:01] but
[1:09:02] you you know i mean
[1:09:04] just what what if god challenged you to
[1:09:07] told you to go to a certain place and
[1:09:10] and go to a certain hospital room at a
[1:09:12] certain hospital and there would be
[1:09:15] somebody in that bed and he wanted you
[1:09:18] to go there and to pray for him and to
[1:09:20] tell him that god was a healer
[1:09:25] i wonder what kind of mind battle you'd
[1:09:27] have
[1:09:32] i mean he asked a lot
[1:09:35] of abraham
[1:09:37] he was asked to believe something i i'd
[1:09:40] like
[1:09:41] what god challenged gideon to believe
[1:09:44] all right you're going to take these 300
[1:09:47] people
[1:09:48] a pot and a torch
[1:09:51] and you're going to go down here and
[1:09:52] defeat this great big army
[1:09:55] gideon believed it before it happened
[1:09:59] and because he believed it it happened
[1:10:03] god asked abraham to believe it before
[1:10:07] it happened and because he believed it
[1:10:10] it happened
[1:10:12] he asked moses to believe it and before
[1:10:16] he believed it before
[1:10:18] it happened
[1:10:22] and we talked a lot about
[1:10:25] rapturing faith
[1:10:30] but it's got to be something that comes
[1:10:33] to us in the form of a faith in the form
[1:10:37] of a revelation something that we are
[1:10:40] believing that's going to happen
[1:10:46] not
[1:10:47] stuck
[1:10:48] in this world
[1:10:50] and our faith being limited to this
[1:10:54] world
[1:10:55] but our faith rising to believe things
[1:10:59] that are out of this world
[1:11:04] and there's a challenge because we're
[1:11:06] too absorbed with this world and the
[1:11:09] things that are going on in this world
[1:11:15] we get absorbed with the battles we have
[1:11:18] in our flesh
[1:11:21] i i i believe and i challenge myself for
[1:11:26] healing and i read the scriptures that
[1:11:28] promise me for healing and i i pray for
[1:11:32] healing i pray with others for healing
[1:11:35] but i wonder if i would take all of that
[1:11:38] faith and believe in a new body
[1:11:46] so that's what we're wanting to
[1:11:48] fellowship
[1:11:50] around
[1:11:52] this morning is that
[1:11:54] that
[1:11:55] they're believing so
[1:11:57] the the lord he makes these statements
[1:12:01] because his life is fixing to end
[1:12:04] you know it's amazing that the prophet
[1:12:07] of god preaches
[1:12:09] this portion that we're going to listen
[1:12:12] to
[1:12:12] things that are believed
[1:12:14] shortly before he was to be taken
[1:12:18] from the scene
[1:12:20] he preaches the rapture
[1:12:22] and he preaches things that are to be
[1:12:26] because
[1:12:27] there's a purpose
[1:12:30] there was a purpose in him leaving
[1:12:34] there's a purpose for all things
[1:12:37] god has a great purpose so if you would
[1:12:41] just join with me
[1:12:43] um
[1:12:45] as we're going to to play
[1:12:48] from the message things that are to be
[1:12:51] uh just 22 minutes
[1:12:53] and then i want you to absorb
[1:12:56] if you could
[1:12:58] uh there there's so much into it we'll
[1:13:01] make a few comments
[1:13:03] on it as we
[1:13:06] read along but i want you as you listen
[1:13:10] to this to think on the thought
[1:13:13] there is another world
[1:13:17] there is another
[1:13:18] world
[1:13:20] and that's the world that even now
[1:13:24] we're invited to live in
[1:13:27] sitting in heavenly places
[1:13:30] in christ jesus so he's going to read
[1:13:33] from
[1:13:38] he's going to read out of the
[1:13:41] the gospel of saint john
[1:13:43] the 14th chapter the first through the
[1:13:46] seventh verse
[1:13:48] so why don't we go ahead and stand and
[1:13:52] and i know we stood for the reading of
[1:13:54] our word but we'll stand for the reading
[1:13:56] of this and then just through the next
[1:13:59] 22 minutes
[1:14:02] listen
[1:14:03] as you find out
[1:14:06] that god has a
[1:14:09] plan
[1:14:12] he has a plan
[1:14:14] and now we're not looking at this world
[1:14:17] we're going to look at the world
[1:14:20] to come
[1:14:21] so lord bless you let's pray father
[1:14:23] bless these minutes of this tape to us
[1:14:27] father we believe that we're actually
[1:14:29] hearing the words of a true prophet
[1:14:33] i know the world today doesn't believe
[1:14:35] in prophets
[1:14:37] lord but they believe in their own
[1:14:39] thinking
[1:14:40] their own selves
[1:14:42] their own interpretation
[1:14:45] their system
[1:14:47] but father you chose to speak to the
[1:14:49] hearts of your children by the holy
[1:14:52] spirit
[1:14:53] and father we know that this
[1:14:56] life
[1:14:57] that we hear and sense
[1:15:00] it rings true
[1:15:02] with the hunger
[1:15:04] that's in our heart
[1:15:06] we ask you to bless now the words of our
[1:15:09] messenger to us
[1:15:11] in jesus precious name we pray
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:18] now let us turn to saint john the 14th
[1:15:21] chapter very familiar scripture that we
[1:15:23] want to read tonight to
[1:15:26] draw from this a context the lord
[1:15:28] willing
[1:15:31] nearly all knows this it seems to be
[1:15:33] many times it's used in funeral
[1:15:35] services
[1:15:37] there was a time that i'd like to preach
[1:15:39] a funeral service to be to this world
[1:15:42] let it die and be born again
[1:15:47] saint john 14
[1:15:49] 1-7
[1:15:50] i believe i have mark down here
[1:15:53] let not your hearts be troubled if you
[1:15:55] believed in god believe also in me
[1:15:58] and my father's house is many mansions
[1:16:00] if it were not so i would have told you
[1:16:02] i go and prepare a place for you if i go
[1:16:05] and prepare a place for you i will come
[1:16:07] again and receive unto myself that where
[1:16:09] i am there you may be also
[1:16:12] where i go you know and the way you know
[1:16:15] thomas sayeth unto him lord we know
[1:16:18] where thou goest and how can we know the
[1:16:21] way
[1:16:21] jesus said unto him i am the way the
[1:16:24] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[1:16:27] the father but by me if you had known me
[1:16:30] you should have known my father also
[1:16:33] and from henceforth you know him and
[1:16:36] have seen him
[1:16:37] may the lord add his blessings to the
[1:16:39] reading of his word and we won't refer
[1:16:41] to it again and uh
[1:16:43] times as we go on while we want to just
[1:16:45] speak a little lesson to the church last
[1:16:48] evening
[1:16:49] i was in yuma arizona
[1:16:52] or my home now i want to share before i
[1:16:55] lived in jeffersville indiana
[1:16:57] now i've been in arizona by a vision
[1:17:00] sending me there a few years ago
[1:17:03] and we resident there that now i don't
[1:17:05] have any church there
[1:17:07] brother greene uh our brother here with
[1:17:09] us has
[1:17:10] established a tabernacle where the one
[1:17:13] of the assemblies of god a church
[1:17:15] downtown assemblies they emerged and i
[1:17:17] think they all went in with brother
[1:17:19] brock and with brother gilmore left this
[1:17:21] church open and brother perry greene
[1:17:23] from
[1:17:24] from
[1:17:25] texas moved in and took the place which
[1:17:28] is associated with us we're glad to know
[1:17:31] that that uh brother greene has reopened
[1:17:34] this church that was closed
[1:17:36] and last night speaking over in
[1:17:39] yuma for the christian businessman
[1:17:43] i spoke on the subject of the rapture
[1:17:46] now that might been a strange subject to
[1:17:48] speak among at a banquet but most
[1:17:52] everyone there was christians and that's
[1:17:54] what it is on these campaigns like this
[1:17:56] or in a church i could say not how many
[1:17:59] of us christians probably every hand
[1:18:00] would go up you're a christian
[1:18:02] and so if we're christians i think we
[1:18:05] ought to be
[1:18:06] uh kindly
[1:18:08] notified ahead we don't
[1:18:10] have to just guess at it we're notified
[1:18:12] what our destination will be
[1:18:15] and i want to speak on that tonight and
[1:18:17] the subject is going to be things that
[1:18:20] are to be
[1:18:21] and now
[1:18:22] speaking last night on the rapture so
[1:18:25] tonight i want to speak on this subject
[1:18:27] that i might
[1:18:28] tie together with last night's message
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:33] there is going to be a rapture we know
[1:18:35] that
[1:18:36] that's in the future to be now jesus
[1:18:39] here
[1:18:40] is
[1:18:41] speaking about
[1:18:42] he's gone ahead to prepare a place for
[1:18:46] us
[1:18:46] let not your hearts be troubled now he
[1:18:48] was talking to jews said now you
[1:18:50] believed in god believe also in me as
[1:18:54] you have believed in god believe in me
[1:18:56] because i am the son of god
[1:18:59] and god in other words i my father are
[1:19:02] one my father is dwelling in me and what
[1:19:06] you see do i'm doing it's not me it's my
[1:19:10] father that dwelleth in me he doeth the
[1:19:12] works
[1:19:13] god was in christ reconciling the world
[1:19:16] to himself it was easy for those jews
[1:19:19] who have been taught through generations
[1:19:21] to believe that there was a great
[1:19:22] supernatural god but to think that that
[1:19:24] god had come down and was manifesting
[1:19:27] himself through the person of his son
[1:19:29] jesus christ god tabernacled in a body
[1:19:32] of flesh that was a little too much for
[1:19:34] him to understand but he said now
[1:19:37] as you have believed in god believe also
[1:19:40] in me for in my father's house are many
[1:19:42] mansions and i'll go to prepare a place
[1:19:45] for you
[1:19:47] jesus life was fixing to end here on
[1:19:50] earth it showed the people and proved to
[1:19:53] him that he was
[1:19:54] jehovah manifested in flesh by the great
[1:19:58] signs and wonders and the reference of
[1:20:00] the bible that he had referred to to
[1:20:02] himself
[1:20:03] and he proved that he was god manifested
[1:20:06] now i said when you see my life ending
[1:20:10] it's ending for a purpose and i'm going
[1:20:13] away to prepare a place for you that
[1:20:16] where i am there you may be also jesus
[1:20:19] therefore is telling his disciples that
[1:20:21] this life is not ended in death
[1:20:25] now
[1:20:27] saying this was a funeral text
[1:20:29] remember we
[1:20:31] death sets right before us and we don't
[1:20:34] know whether there may be some in this
[1:20:37] building tonight will not go out of here
[1:20:39] alive in this physical life that's how
[1:20:42] uncertain it is five minutes from now it
[1:20:45] could be that
[1:20:46] young healthy young people in this
[1:20:49] building can be a corpse in five minutes
[1:20:51] from now that is true
[1:20:53] and again it could be in five minutes
[1:20:55] from now with everyone be in glory
[1:20:58] we just don't know that's in the hands
[1:21:00] of god jesus said he didn't know himself
[1:21:02] when that time would be but that was in
[1:21:04] the hands of the father only now but he
[1:21:07] was telling them that after death there
[1:21:10] is life because i go and prepare a place
[1:21:14] that is to receive them
[1:21:17] shows that there he was speaking to him
[1:21:20] that there was a life after this life is
[1:21:23] ended
[1:21:24] and what a consolation i'd ought to give
[1:21:26] to all of us to know that after this
[1:21:29] life is over there is a life that we go
[1:21:32] into
[1:21:33] and as you get older that becomes more
[1:21:36] of a reality to you as you begin to see
[1:21:38] the days of your life drawing close then
[1:21:42] it begins to
[1:21:44] you begin to pack up closer getting
[1:21:46] ready for that great event
[1:21:49] it's uh not it's a continuum of this
[1:21:52] same life in another world another place
[1:21:56] your birth here
[1:21:57] was pre-planned i guess you believe that
[1:22:00] every one of you knows that our birth
[1:22:02] was pre-planned did you know that your
[1:22:06] being here never originated just in a
[1:22:09] myth or a thought everything was all
[1:22:12] pre-planned by god before the foundation
[1:22:15] of the world
[1:22:16] the infinite god
[1:22:18] knowed ever to be to be infinite he had
[1:22:21] to no ever flee that ever would be in
[1:22:24] the earth and how many times it would
[1:22:25] bat its eyes that's infinite see
[1:22:29] our little our little minds cannot
[1:22:31] fathom what infinite means the infinite
[1:22:35] god he knowed all things therefore
[1:22:37] there's nothing allocator
[1:22:39] if we know the word of god we know where
[1:22:42] we are living we know that our that
[1:22:44] we're living in
[1:22:45] we know what lays ahead we see what we
[1:22:49] pass and the book of god is the
[1:22:52] revelation of jesus christ his works
[1:22:55] through the ages that was up to the book
[1:22:57] of revelation and then his promises that
[1:23:00] is to come
[1:23:02] so all of his promises are true god
[1:23:04] cannot speak any word without it being
[1:23:07] confirmed every word that he says has to
[1:23:11] come to pass
[1:23:12] before the foundation of the world some
[1:23:14] people mix genesis up there when he said
[1:23:17] god repeats himself no just your
[1:23:19] misunderstanding
[1:23:20] see god at the beginning he said let
[1:23:22] there be
[1:23:23] let there be let there be the world
[1:23:26] would just darken a chaos even when he
[1:23:28] said let there be light there might have
[1:23:30] been hundreds of years before light ever
[1:23:32] sprung in but when he spoke it it has to
[1:23:35] come to pass it must be that way see and
[1:23:39] he spoke his word them seeds was beneath
[1:23:42] the water when he dried off the earth
[1:23:44] then the seeds come up
[1:23:46] what he says must come to pass
[1:23:49] he said through the prophets i referred
[1:23:50] to it last evening
[1:23:52] like we take isaiah he said a virgin
[1:23:55] shall conceive who would think of a man
[1:23:57] that was thought of among people to say
[1:23:59] such a word is that a virgin shall
[1:24:02] conceive
[1:24:03] but because he a prophet is a reflector
[1:24:07] of god he is made so that he cannot
[1:24:10] speak his own words it has to be god's
[1:24:12] words that he speaks he's just like a
[1:24:14] reflector
[1:24:15] and he is god's mouthpiece
[1:24:17] and so therefore he said a virgin can
[1:24:20] shall conceive he probably could not
[1:24:21] understand it but god had spoken through
[1:24:24] him because he promised that he would do
[1:24:26] nothing until he revealed it to his
[1:24:28] servants the prophets then when he said
[1:24:30] that it was 800 years before that ever
[1:24:33] come to pass but it had to come to pass
[1:24:36] finally those words of god anchored in
[1:24:39] the womb of a virgin and she conceived
[1:24:41] and brought forth emmanuel unto us
[1:24:45] a child is born unto us a son is given
[1:24:48] his name shall be called the counselor
[1:24:50] the mighty god the prince of peace the
[1:24:52] everlasting father that had to be that
[1:24:55] way because god had spoken to the mouth
[1:24:58] of his prophets and all the words of god
[1:25:01] has to be fulfilled therefore we know
[1:25:04] that jesus has gone to prepare a place
[1:25:07] to receive a people unto himself amen
[1:25:10] who those people are i hope it's we are
[1:25:13] part of those people tonight if it isn't
[1:25:15] my friend
[1:25:16] god has made a way a condition that you
[1:25:18] can be included in that if you want to
[1:25:22] your own free moral agency you can act
[1:25:24] the way you wish to but now notice
[1:25:27] now in this world that is to come there
[1:25:30] is a world to come just like your birth
[1:25:32] here i said
[1:25:33] you always prepared god knew you would
[1:25:35] be here
[1:25:37] and now
[1:25:38] you know even things that your parents
[1:25:40] done
[1:25:41] uh people think that that isn't visit
[1:25:43] from generation to generation but it is
[1:25:46] over in the book of hebrews i believe
[1:25:48] the about the seventh chapter speaking
[1:25:50] paul there the writers i believe it was
[1:25:53] was speaking on
[1:25:55] um
[1:25:56] a great event that taken place with
[1:25:58] abraham that he paid ties to melchizedek
[1:26:02] when he was returning from the slaughter
[1:26:03] of the king
[1:26:04] and now he said that levi was in the
[1:26:08] loins of abraham
[1:26:10] when he met melchizedek coming from the
[1:26:13] slaughter of the kings and then he
[1:26:15] reckoned that to levi paying tithes also
[1:26:19] when he was in the lawns of abraham his
[1:26:21] great-great-grandfather
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] and he visits the sins of the people
[1:26:26] upon their
[1:26:27] children from generation to generation
[1:26:29] that won't keep his word see you were
[1:26:32] all pre-planned
[1:26:34] by god nothing happens by chance with
[1:26:36] god he knows all about it it's all
[1:26:39] pre-planned planned for many generations
[1:26:42] back
[1:26:43] so that you could be here tonight did
[1:26:45] you know that
[1:26:46] just think
[1:26:48] that you at one time i'll repeat this
[1:26:50] again
[1:26:51] you at one time was in your father
[1:26:54] in the chain of your father
[1:26:56] now he didn't know you
[1:26:58] at that time neither did you know him at
[1:27:00] that time
[1:27:01] but you see
[1:27:03] then you were put in the bedding ground
[1:27:05] and the womb of mother through holy
[1:27:08] wedlock and then you become a person
[1:27:10] expressed in the image like your father
[1:27:13] then there's fellowship
[1:27:15] now the only way that you can be a son a
[1:27:17] daughter of god
[1:27:19] because you have to be
[1:27:21] uh you have to have eternal life and
[1:27:24] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:27:26] and that's god's life
[1:27:28] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:27:31] god there to be a son of god you had to
[1:27:33] be in him
[1:27:35] always
[1:27:37] the chain of your life spiritual life
[1:27:39] tonight was in god the father before
[1:27:42] there was even a
[1:27:44] molecule and you're nothing but the
[1:27:47] manifestation
[1:27:48] of the chain of life that was in god as
[1:27:52] a son of god now you're expressed after
[1:27:54] his word has come in you to light up
[1:27:57] this age you are the expressing god's
[1:28:01] life in you because you are a son or a
[1:28:04] daughter of god
[1:28:06] therefore
[1:28:08] you get why see you are in you are now
[1:28:12] made you're sitting in this church
[1:28:13] tonight because your duty is to express
[1:28:17] god to this nation and this people in
[1:28:20] this neighborhood or you associate
[1:28:23] wherever you are god knew that you would
[1:28:26] be here because you have to be one of
[1:28:28] his genes or his attributes
[1:28:31] you had to be
[1:28:33] if you ever if you've got eternal life
[1:28:35] then it always was eternal life and god
[1:28:38] before there was a foundation world knew
[1:28:40] that you would be here and when the word
[1:28:42] of the water the washing of the water
[1:28:44] the word fell upon you you it was
[1:28:46] expressed in a being now you have
[1:28:48] fellowship with your father god just as
[1:28:50] you have with your earthly father
[1:28:53] you are
[1:28:54] citizens of the king not citizens but
[1:28:56] you are
[1:28:57] children sons and daughters of the
[1:29:00] living god
[1:29:02] if it be that the eternal life dwells in
[1:29:05] you
[1:29:06] now then if it was jesus was the
[1:29:09] fullness of god manifested he was the
[1:29:12] fullness of the godhead bodily therefore
[1:29:14] when he came to the earth
[1:29:16] and was manifested in flesh you were
[1:29:18] here in him then because he was the word
[1:29:22] in the beginning was the words with god
[1:29:24] and the word was god and the word was
[1:29:26] made flesh and dwelt among us the word
[1:29:29] was made flesh therefore you walked with
[1:29:32] him when you were in him when he was on
[1:29:34] earth you suffered with him
[1:29:36] and you died with him he was buried with
[1:29:40] him and now you're risen with him
[1:29:43] and manifested attributes of god sitting
[1:29:46] in heavenly places already raised
[1:29:49] resurrected to new life and setting in
[1:29:51] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:29:55] oh
[1:29:57] that means so much nowadays church
[1:30:01] that means so much to us the
[1:30:04] see our self-position
[1:30:06] placed in jesus christ
[1:30:08] now if we are those attributes of god we
[1:30:13] cannot live by creeds
[1:30:15] we cannot live by denominationalism
[1:30:18] we must live by the word because the
[1:30:21] bride is a part of the bridegroom like
[1:30:24] any wife is a part of her husband
[1:30:27] therefore we must be that word bride
[1:30:32] and what is that word bride the
[1:30:34] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:30:37] a creed or a denomination but a living
[1:30:39] article of god that's right a living
[1:30:42] attribute of god displaying
[1:30:44] to the world the attributes of god in
[1:30:48] the formation of the bride that's to be
[1:30:51] expressed in this hour that we're now
[1:30:53] living
[1:30:54] martin luther could not express the
[1:30:55] attributes that we express because that
[1:30:58] that was in the beginning the
[1:31:00] resurrection like the corn of wheat that
[1:31:01] went into the earth
[1:31:03] i will re-quote this again you probably
[1:31:05] read the book that german making fun of
[1:31:07] me and said i was a fanatic of all the
[1:31:09] fanatics he was a he was absolutely
[1:31:11] against everything that's called god and
[1:31:13] even made fun of god said a god that
[1:31:15] could open the red sea instead take his
[1:31:17] people out and sit with his hands across
[1:31:19] his tummy and that through the dark ages
[1:31:20] all those people dying suffering those
[1:31:22] little children being eaten by lines you
[1:31:25] see the whole
[1:31:26] whole program the whole church is built
[1:31:29] upon divine revelation
[1:31:32] jesus said in saint matthews the 16th
[1:31:34] chapter
[1:31:36] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:31:37] you but my father which is in heaven has
[1:31:39] revealed this to you
[1:31:41] what was the revelation of who he was
[1:31:43] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:31:46] in the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:31:48] against it
[1:31:49] the revelation of jesus christ in this
[1:31:52] hour
[1:31:54] not what he was in another hour what he
[1:31:56] was now the bible expresses it's growing
[1:31:58] in the bride to the full statute
[1:32:00] therefore if the corner wheat of christ
[1:32:03] had to fall in the ground so did the
[1:32:05] bride have to fall in the ground through
[1:32:07] the dark ages any grain that goes in the
[1:32:09] ground must die or it can't produce
[1:32:11] itself reproduce itself and the great
[1:32:13] church that he established on the day of
[1:32:15] pentecost by the sending of the holy
[1:32:17] ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go
[1:32:19] into the dirt into the earth in the dark
[1:32:21] age to bring forth again in the age of
[1:32:24] luther and come on out to the full
[1:32:26] statue of the bride of jesus christ for
[1:32:28] this last day see there's no way
[1:32:30] therefore the bride and the rapture will
[1:32:33] come forth and there is all pre-planned
[1:32:36] by god all backed up from the beginning
[1:32:39] he knowed every man every place who
[1:32:42] would sit all about it it's all
[1:32:43] pre-planned god knew it would be here
[1:32:46] and when when he made it that way
[1:32:49] so that when we get there he's going to
[1:32:52] prepare a place for us and when we get
[1:32:54] there it'll all be prepared just like
[1:32:56] even this night is prepared
[1:32:59] like this hour is prepared
[1:33:02] this is great for knowledge tells him
[1:33:04] all these things
[1:33:06] by for knowledge he's omnipresent
[1:33:08] because he's ominous mission ominous
[1:33:10] mission because he's omnipresent
[1:33:12] therefore by his poor knowledge now he
[1:33:14] can't be just like the wind over the
[1:33:15] earth because he is a being
[1:33:18] he just isn't a myth he's a being he
[1:33:20] dwells he even dwells in a house he
[1:33:22] dwells in a place called heaven
[1:33:24] and therefore by his
[1:33:27] ominate being omnipresent being omni
[1:33:29] mission knowing all things then he is
[1:33:31] omnipresent because he knows all things
[1:33:34] you
[1:33:35] now you grew from your birth when you
[1:33:39] was born and presented into this world
[1:33:42] god
[1:33:43] knew that you were going to be here in
[1:33:45] this earth and you grown from birth to
[1:33:48] maturity
[1:33:49] things that seem so strange to you
[1:33:51] uh in your young
[1:33:53] womanhood young
[1:33:55] boyhood as children
[1:33:57] now seems very real
[1:34:00] you couldn't understand it when he was a
[1:34:01] child but now as you become adult you
[1:34:05] begin to understand and find out that
[1:34:07] everything was just set just right and
[1:34:10] you it really means something to you now
[1:34:12] so is it in your spiritual birth
[1:34:14] you do things that you don't understand
[1:34:17] when your little baby come to the altar
[1:34:20] you give your life to christ you do such
[1:34:22] strange things you wonder why you did it
[1:34:24] but after a while when you mature as
[1:34:26] matured christians then you understand
[1:34:28] it see there's something picks up you
[1:34:30] see why you had to do it your spiritual
[1:34:32] birth or your natural birth types your
[1:34:34] spiritual how how it fitted to you in
[1:34:37] this life as you grew everything fitted
[1:34:39] right in because you were made for that
[1:34:42] was it a strange thing the night that
[1:34:43] you staggered into the mission the tent
[1:34:45] meeting or the little church somewhere
[1:34:47] on the corner and something a preacher
[1:34:49] preached on a certain subject and you
[1:34:51] just fell right at the altar see
[1:34:53] see
[1:34:54] god knew that before the foundation of
[1:34:56] the world see
[1:34:58] it seems strange to you why you did it
[1:34:59] then but now you understand you knew
[1:35:02] what happened
[1:35:04] it's so fitting to you and this life and
[1:35:07] will be also in the life that is to come
[1:35:10] this world and this life seems that the
[1:35:13] advance as you mature everything seems
[1:35:16] to go right with you
[1:35:17] i don't believe in uh
[1:35:19] that a person just happened to be here
[1:35:21] by chance i just think when you come to
[1:35:24] the the world everything had to be for
[1:35:28] prepared for you or pre-prepared rather
[1:35:31] uh for you i don't
[1:35:34] hardly understand that how that we could
[1:35:37] think that a god
[1:35:38] that could prepare all these good things
[1:35:41] for us
[1:35:43] would not we could not put trust in him
[1:35:45] that if he brought us in this chaos that
[1:35:48] we're in now and prepared the good
[1:35:50] things of life for us here how much more
[1:35:52] can we trust him to prepare the things
[1:35:55] that is to come
[1:35:56] see the eternal things
[1:35:59] it seems i say very strange
[1:36:02] and i i do not think that heaven is a
[1:36:05] place that my mother used to tell me
[1:36:07] about
[1:36:08] i believe that the church has grown from
[1:36:10] that
[1:36:10] to think that used to be a hundred years
[1:36:13] ago or two i think the old timers used
[1:36:15] to think that everyone that died went up
[1:36:17] to heaven and had a harp
[1:36:19] and and set up there on the clouds and
[1:36:22] and played a harp
[1:36:23] now they know that there was a place
[1:36:25] called heaven but they if that be so all
[1:36:28] the musicians that have it on us you see
[1:36:31] but it isn't that kind of a place it
[1:36:35] isn't playing harps at all
[1:36:37] i believe don't believe the bible
[1:36:38] teaches that but that was a conception
[1:36:41] that they had before the fullness of the
[1:36:43] word come into existence or the opening
[1:36:46] of the seven seals that promised to us
[1:36:48] in this age that we then understand i
[1:36:51] believe that heaven is a real place just
[1:36:54] the same as this is a real place
[1:36:57] for god starred us in our spiritual
[1:36:59] growth in this place and i believe that
[1:37:02] heaven is a place just as real as this
[1:37:04] where we don't sit up there for eternity
[1:37:06] and just sit there on a cloud we don't
[1:37:09] just strum our heart for all all from
[1:37:12] here ever but we're going to a real
[1:37:14] place
[1:37:15] where we're going to do things where
[1:37:17] we're going to live we're going to work
[1:37:19] we're going to enjoy
[1:37:21] we're going to live we're going to life
[1:37:24] to a real eternal life
[1:37:26] we're going to a heaven
[1:37:28] a paradise just like adam and eve worked
[1:37:32] and lived and eat and enjoyed in the
[1:37:34] garden of eden before sin came in we're
[1:37:37] on our road right back there again
[1:37:40] right back the first adam through sin
[1:37:43] taking us out the second adam through
[1:37:45] righteousness bring us back in again
[1:37:47] justifies us and brings us back in
[1:37:57] [Applause]
[1:38:00] all right we're just going to
[1:38:02] just
[1:38:04] okay because
[1:38:06] i i if i could say this i believe god
[1:38:09] wants us
[1:38:10] i believe he wants to expand our borders
[1:38:14] you know what i mean he wants us to
[1:38:17] if we could say to have the right mental
[1:38:19] attitude or
[1:38:21] death to have our our faith
[1:38:24] uh grow so
[1:38:26] let's just
[1:38:27] look at just a few things here and
[1:38:30] and uh just go by them over them again
[1:38:35] if i could
[1:38:36] real
[1:38:37] quick
[1:38:38] so
[1:38:39] he said he says there now we know that
[1:38:41] jesus has gone to prepare a place
[1:38:44] to receive a people unto himself
[1:38:48] who those people are i hope it's
[1:38:52] you know a part of him tonight
[1:38:54] if it isn't my friend god makes a way
[1:38:56] for those tonight
[1:38:58] and so he goes on he says
[1:39:00] you're on free moral agency you can act
[1:39:03] the way you wish to
[1:39:05] but now notice now
[1:39:07] in this world
[1:39:09] that is to come
[1:39:11] there is
[1:39:13] a world
[1:39:15] to come amen
[1:39:17] so there there's uh
[1:39:20] another
[1:39:22] world
[1:39:23] to come so
[1:39:25] that's the first thing that uh he begins
[1:39:28] to uh lay out to us
[1:39:31] uh he he makes this statement
[1:39:34] uh here he says now he says
[1:39:37] he tells us then that after death there
[1:39:40] is life
[1:39:43] so
[1:39:44] he he wants them to know
[1:39:46] he's telling them something
[1:39:48] this isn't the end of it
[1:39:52] that there is a life to come
[1:39:55] there's another
[1:39:56] world to come there is a world that's
[1:39:59] coming
[1:40:02] and he's gone to prepare
[1:40:04] that place for you
[1:40:07] but we've got to understand he's also
[1:40:09] preparing us
[1:40:11] for that world
[1:40:16] it didn't he say that uh
[1:40:20] when you verb
[1:40:21] when you uh
[1:40:22] were born you grew
[1:40:26] you grew that you grew up and then
[1:40:29] things began to make sense to you
[1:40:33] he says now your spiritual life
[1:40:36] should be growing
[1:40:38] so the things that we're growing into
[1:40:42] is going to allow us to make sense of
[1:40:47] the world that we're going into
[1:40:50] he's not giving you we we're mixed up we
[1:40:54] think that we're supposed to get all
[1:40:56] this power in all this revelation for
[1:41:00] this world but what he's trying to say
[1:41:02] our faith has to go beyond this world
[1:41:08] we're not believing for to change this
[1:41:11] world is going to be destroyed
[1:41:16] but there's another world coming
[1:41:19] another world order
[1:41:22] another law
[1:41:24] that's going to govern there's laws that
[1:41:27] govern us we know about the law of
[1:41:29] gravity right how many knows where this
[1:41:32] is going to go when i throw it up
[1:41:36] what goes up
[1:41:38] right
[1:41:39] now whatever if i threw this and this
[1:41:41] didn't come up
[1:41:43] there would be two things right you'd
[1:41:45] claim that i was a musician
[1:41:48] or is that a musician
[1:41:50] i don't know it's a mystery to me how
[1:41:52] they play those instruments
[1:41:54] but you would have to say that something
[1:41:56] happened because there's a law
[1:41:58] that governs that
[1:42:02] so what happens is we get bound
[1:42:05] by the laws of this world
[1:42:09] and our faith is limited to the laws of
[1:42:13] this world but god's not preparing us
[1:42:16] for this world
[1:42:19] he's preparing us for a world to come we
[1:42:23] are being prepared now for a world to
[1:42:26] come he is preparing his bride
[1:42:30] for the world that she he is going to
[1:42:34] take her into because when she gets into
[1:42:38] that world she's not going to operate
[1:42:41] the way that she does in this world
[1:42:44] her faith is not going to be a faith of
[1:42:47] this world it's going to be the faith of
[1:42:50] that world
[1:42:53] all things are done by faith with god
[1:42:56] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:42:58] god so remember if it takes faith to
[1:43:02] please god and god is an unchanging god
[1:43:05] then the faith that we please god within
[1:43:08] this world it would still have to be
[1:43:10] faith or revelation in that world
[1:43:17] we don't want to be bound we're just
[1:43:19] talking about
[1:43:20] i i think the world i'm amazed at how
[1:43:24] the world always satan always testifies
[1:43:28] of what god's doing
[1:43:31] and tries to take
[1:43:33] what god's doing because he understands
[1:43:35] what god's doing because god's people
[1:43:38] are moving away from his world
[1:43:42] but so he sees what god's doing he sees
[1:43:45] how he's preparing us and then he offers
[1:43:48] the same principles
[1:43:50] and back to his world
[1:43:53] so he can produce a copy
[1:43:57] how many have ever heard this saying
[1:43:59] think outside the box
[1:44:05] that's a rob
[1:44:09] that because god knows satan knows what
[1:44:11] god's trying to do
[1:44:13] he's trying to prepare his people to
[1:44:16] think outside of this world
[1:44:18] so he tries to say say that expand your
[1:44:22] minds expand your thinking inventions
[1:44:25] and everything but god is now taking his
[1:44:29] people
[1:44:33] he's
[1:44:34] telling them
[1:44:36] that you are the gene of god you're the
[1:44:39] manifested attributes of god all the
[1:44:43] attributes that god has you have
[1:44:52] all them that believed in him he gave
[1:44:54] power to become the sons and daughters
[1:44:58] of god
[1:45:02] so he as he as we're saying here he says
[1:45:07] to prepare a place
[1:45:12] he says and what a consolation that
[1:45:14] ought to give
[1:45:16] to
[1:45:17] to all of us to know that there is a
[1:45:21] that this life is over there is a life
[1:45:25] that we go into
[1:45:29] and as you get older that becomes more
[1:45:31] and more real to you
[1:45:33] as you begin to see the days of your
[1:45:35] life drawing close then it begins
[1:45:40] begins to
[1:45:41] pack up closer and getting ready
[1:45:45] for that great event
[1:45:48] it's now it's a continuing of the same
[1:45:52] life in another world
[1:45:55] another place it's a continuation
[1:45:59] of the same life
[1:46:02] in another world
[1:46:04] because we're just wanting to
[1:46:07] uh
[1:46:08] if i could say just lay
[1:46:10] uh
[1:46:11] that down
[1:46:13] so deep
[1:46:14] he says
[1:46:16] and so we talked about we know that
[1:46:18] everything was pre-planned
[1:46:21] so this world to come is pre-planned
[1:46:26] it's part of the plan of god
[1:46:29] so god calling you and choosing you
[1:46:32] and revealing to you the word of god is
[1:46:36] part of the plan
[1:46:38] of god not just the plan for this world
[1:46:42] but the plan for the other world well if
[1:46:45] i could get you to understand there's
[1:46:46] reasons why god is starting to share
[1:46:49] with us the the understanding that
[1:46:53] you're the gene of god
[1:46:56] that you're the attributes of god
[1:46:59] that god was a savior why because you're
[1:47:02] going to be a savior
[1:47:07] that's right you're gonna be a
[1:47:09] healer
[1:47:11] you're going to be delivering everything
[1:47:13] that god wants to write how many knows
[1:47:16] basic algebra
[1:47:19] all right so
[1:47:21] come here my brother
[1:47:26] all right
[1:47:27] i'm going to teach you basic algebra
[1:47:29] how many knows i'm a great mathematician
[1:47:32] you know why you don't know that because
[1:47:34] i'm not thank you that one little child
[1:47:36] that believes me
[1:47:40] this is a
[1:47:45] come here ellen
[1:47:55] this is b
[1:47:58] a
[1:47:58] b
[1:48:00] and y your c
[1:48:03] no
[1:48:04] you're b
[1:48:08] all right
[1:48:11] all that a was
[1:48:15] right
[1:48:16] he poured into b
[1:48:18] so now a is equal to
[1:48:22] b
[1:48:23] all that b was
[1:48:26] he poured into c
[1:48:28] so now
[1:48:30] b
[1:48:31] is equal to c
[1:48:34] right
[1:48:35] so if a is equal to b
[1:48:40] and b is equal to c
[1:48:43] then
[1:48:44] c is equal
[1:48:47] to
[1:48:49] 2a
[1:48:52] that's right
[1:48:54] no you don't get it
[1:48:58] two plus two
[1:49:00] is four
[1:49:03] right if a
[1:49:05] is equal to b
[1:49:07] and b is equal to c so he's the same
[1:49:09] he's the same he's the same so do these
[1:49:13] two have to be the same so if all that
[1:49:15] god poured into christ thank you a b and
[1:49:18] c
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:28] all that god was
[1:49:30] so okay and now we're being told this
[1:49:33] you're the gene of god
[1:49:36] right right
[1:49:38] you you're the all you are the
[1:49:41] attributes of god everything that god
[1:49:44] was
[1:49:46] right
[1:49:47] you are
[1:49:48] because you were in christ
[1:49:52] right when he went to calvary you were
[1:49:55] there when he resurrected you were
[1:49:57] resurrected with him he did all those
[1:50:00] things you were there so what god was he
[1:50:03] put in to be
[1:50:05] you were in be
[1:50:07] so from be he turned into
[1:50:11] c
[1:50:14] it's a the condensation of god
[1:50:18] it's god because he has a plan
[1:50:21] and you're part of the plan the part of
[1:50:24] the plan that you paid this god was
[1:50:26] going to be all that he was he poured
[1:50:28] into christ so christ came all that
[1:50:31] christ was he poured into the church
[1:50:33] because he knows he wants the church to
[1:50:36] be
[1:50:36] all that he is
[1:50:42] all the attributes
[1:50:46] everything that god is
[1:50:49] he he
[1:50:50] he pours it in you so there's another
[1:50:53] world coming
[1:50:55] he's because he says it's a continuation
[1:50:58] of this same life in
[1:51:00] uh same life in another world another
[1:51:04] place that's why
[1:51:06] he's getting this life here
[1:51:10] if it's going to be the same life
[1:51:14] it's not going to be a sinful life
[1:51:20] not going to be a carnal life
[1:51:23] but it's going to be a spiritual life
[1:51:26] that he prepared in you
[1:51:28] right and didn't we just
[1:51:30] hear him say that
[1:51:32] just a second ago he says now we know
[1:51:36] the word of god
[1:51:38] we know where we are living
[1:51:40] we know the hour we're living in
[1:51:43] we know what lies ahead
[1:51:45] what we see what we passed
[1:51:50] then his that's
[1:51:52] and then his promises that is to come
[1:51:56] now listen
[1:51:58] and the book of god is the revelation of
[1:52:01] jesus christ
[1:52:03] his work through the ages
[1:52:05] that was up to the book of revelation
[1:52:09] and then his promises that is to come
[1:52:13] and then i marked that quote uh i don't
[1:52:16] know if i i've
[1:52:19] i've got it here
[1:52:20] uh
[1:52:23] he talked about the opening of the seals
[1:52:26] and
[1:52:30] see if i find it right here
[1:52:31] where he's he talked about well i just
[1:52:34] won't
[1:52:34] uh he won't do it but i'll read this he
[1:52:37] says
[1:52:38] he says
[1:52:40] he says and now you are risen with him
[1:52:43] and manifested attributes of god
[1:52:46] the manifested attributes of god you are
[1:52:49] the manifested attributes of god
[1:52:52] so everything that god all the
[1:52:56] attributes that god has you are going
[1:52:59] you are manifesting them you are not
[1:53:02] manifesting them for
[1:53:04] this
[1:53:05] world
[1:53:09] can can i
[1:53:11] get that out are we so
[1:53:14] hung up in this world
[1:53:16] so controlled by the dimensions of this
[1:53:21] world
[1:53:22] all the things that we can see have to
[1:53:25] happen
[1:53:26] in this world before we can see him the
[1:53:31] only way that we can know that god's a
[1:53:33] healer is if we see healing in this
[1:53:35] world the only way we can see
[1:53:38] he's a deliverer is to see that he's a
[1:53:41] deliverer in this world we can we
[1:53:43] haven't even begin to imagine that i'm
[1:53:46] taking these attributes into another
[1:53:50] world where i'll be expressing them in
[1:53:54] another world another dimension a whole
[1:53:57] nother
[1:53:58] uh existence
[1:54:02] god has a plan for me
[1:54:06] in another world
[1:54:10] i don't want to be so hung up getting
[1:54:12] out of this world
[1:54:15] that i can't have faith
[1:54:18] for the world to come
[1:54:24] he says now
[1:54:26] we are those attributes of god
[1:54:29] we cannot live by creeds
[1:54:32] we cannot live by denominationalism
[1:54:35] we must live
[1:54:37] by
[1:54:38] the word
[1:54:40] we cannot live by man's carnal thinking
[1:54:44] we cannot live you know there's a lot of
[1:54:47] denominations a political parties are a
[1:54:50] denomination
[1:54:56] groups and
[1:54:57] organizations and
[1:54:59] causes
[1:55:00] that people fight for
[1:55:03] the furtherance of cat lovers of america
[1:55:06] because that that is a denomination it's
[1:55:09] a system it's an organization we can't
[1:55:13] live by those things in other words he's
[1:55:15] trying to tell us you can't live by
[1:55:18] carnal things we've got to rise up
[1:55:21] beyond our world our faith has got to go
[1:55:24] out of this world and understand we are
[1:55:28] living
[1:55:29] by the things that god told us that we
[1:55:33] are which is that we're the gene and
[1:55:36] we're the attributes of god
[1:55:39] that's where our victory is in this
[1:55:41] world
[1:55:44] you want to overcome something in the
[1:55:46] world or you have an adversary
[1:55:50] you don't
[1:55:51] you don't fight this the adversary with
[1:55:54] a sword
[1:55:57] right he who uses the sword perishes by
[1:56:00] the sword
[1:56:01] but you win your victories by the
[1:56:03] attributes of god
[1:56:06] someone hates you and you forgive
[1:56:11] you you do good to them that hate you
[1:56:17] you you the love of god that shed abroad
[1:56:19] in your heart
[1:56:21] that's what you use
[1:56:24] you don't fight
[1:56:26] you you don't fight
[1:56:28] sin with sin
[1:56:30] you don't fight criticism
[1:56:32] with criticism
[1:56:34] you fight criticism with the attribute
[1:56:37] of humility
[1:56:38] you fight the things of god with the
[1:56:41] attributes of god if something is coming
[1:56:44] against you you you don't set up a
[1:56:46] battle plan
[1:56:52] the very attributes that god
[1:56:56] placed in you by placing himself in you
[1:57:00] right he said
[1:57:02] satan desires to sift thee of sand
[1:57:06] but i have overcome the world
[1:57:11] and and just the fact that you're the
[1:57:14] son and daughter of god that the gene of
[1:57:17] god what is a gene a genus the
[1:57:19] characteristics that are transferred
[1:57:22] from the father to his children
[1:57:26] if we want to check somebody's
[1:57:28] who their father is we give them a dna
[1:57:31] test right we find that gene
[1:57:36] that identifies them what identifies you
[1:57:40] as a son and daughter of god is the
[1:57:43] attributes of god in you
[1:57:48] because the world to come
[1:57:52] you're going to live by those attributes
[1:57:56] you're not going to take none of this
[1:57:58] junk
[1:58:00] with us
[1:58:04] the the carnal mind is what
[1:58:07] enmity against god
[1:58:11] but the spiritual mind is life and
[1:58:13] liberty
[1:58:15] and victory
[1:58:19] we can't figure out schemes if we would
[1:58:21] just live
[1:58:23] by the attributes of god
[1:58:25] if we would turn the other cheek
[1:58:29] if we would go the extra mile
[1:58:32] if we would give our coat
[1:58:37] if if the if that character
[1:58:40] of christ was
[1:58:42] manifested in the attributes it
[1:58:45] overcomes every adversary
[1:58:50] every adversity
[1:58:54] you don't have to have more knowledge
[1:58:58] i was dumber in a mud fence in school
[1:59:03] they gave the mud fence an a before they
[1:59:05] give me an a
[1:59:08] you know i had a lot of learning
[1:59:10] disabilities
[1:59:12] praise god you don't have to have
[1:59:14] you can have a learning disability and
[1:59:17] god still give you revelation
[1:59:21] praise god the church isn't built on
[1:59:23] your ability to comprehend it's built on
[1:59:26] the ability to receive the revelation
[1:59:29] that god gives you
[1:59:31] now do you get the revelation that he's
[1:59:33] trying to tell you you're going to
[1:59:35] another world you know if you're going
[1:59:38] to go to another world wouldn't you be
[1:59:40] wise enough to prepare for the world to
[1:59:43] come
[1:59:49] how many knows what you're going to take
[1:59:51] with you
[1:59:52] only one thing
[1:59:54] your character
[1:59:58] character is not a gift
[2:00:00] it's a victory it's molded in the fiery
[2:00:03] furnace of affliction
[2:00:07] it's proven
[2:00:09] it's time tested
[2:00:11] how do you know you have an attribute
[2:00:14] because it rises to the occasion every
[2:00:17] time because it is what you are
[2:00:23] [Applause]
[2:00:25] if you're a gossip
[2:00:27] you'll gossip every time
[2:00:30] you won't be able to keep your mouth
[2:00:32] shut
[2:00:35] well that sister
[2:00:37] you know
[2:00:40] she's just like this
[2:00:44] i just gotta help myself
[2:00:48] why are we new creatures
[2:00:51] in christ jesus why are we born again
[2:00:54] why does the old man die
[2:00:56] and all things pass away and all things
[2:01:00] become new
[2:01:03] he's trying to get us to rise our faith
[2:01:07] above this world
[2:01:09] our faith isn't measured by this world
[2:01:11] believe it or not our faith is measured
[2:01:15] by the world to come
[2:01:20] amen
[2:01:25] he says now if we are those attributes
[2:01:27] of god we can't live by creeds
[2:01:30] we can't live by dominations we must
[2:01:32] live by the word because the bride is
[2:01:35] part of the bridegroom like any wife is
[2:01:38] part of her husband
[2:01:40] therefore we must be that word bride
[2:01:44] and what
[2:01:46] and
[2:01:47] and what is that word bride
[2:01:50] the manifestation
[2:01:52] of this hour
[2:01:54] the bride's not a creed or denomination
[2:01:58] but a living oracle of god
[2:02:05] a living attribute
[2:02:09] of god
[2:02:13] amen
[2:02:13] what is the bride a living oracle
[2:02:17] a living attribute
[2:02:20] why are we going to be living oracles
[2:02:23] and living attributes of god if this
[2:02:25] world's going to be destroyed
[2:02:29] we're not living
[2:02:30] oracles of god and attributes of god for
[2:02:34] this world
[2:02:36] amen
[2:02:37] we're living oracles of god for the
[2:02:39] world to come
[2:02:44] oh church
[2:02:46] you're not called into this world we're
[2:02:49] being called out of this world this
[2:02:51] message didn't come
[2:02:53] it didn't come
[2:02:56] so that we could be
[2:02:58] victorious in this world
[2:03:01] but that we would be victorious in this
[2:03:04] world and the life to come
[2:03:08] in the world to come so i'm trying to
[2:03:11] say when we can start rising our faith
[2:03:13] up
[2:03:14] a little bit higher
[2:03:19] and then he goes on he says
[2:03:22] the attribute for this hour of living
[2:03:24] now
[2:03:25] and he talks about
[2:03:26] uh
[2:03:28] malachi
[2:03:30] martin luther he couldn't express it
[2:03:32] then
[2:03:33] right because it had to grow
[2:03:36] it it had to grow up
[2:03:38] it had to grow so it's growing he says
[2:03:41] the revelation of jesus christ in this
[2:03:43] hour
[2:03:44] not what he was in another hour
[2:03:48] what he was now
[2:03:51] the bible expresses
[2:03:54] it's growing into
[2:03:57] the bride
[2:03:58] to the full stature
[2:04:03] we see that right therefore if the
[2:04:05] corner wheat of christ fall into the
[2:04:08] ground the bot and did the bride will
[2:04:11] have to fall
[2:04:12] in the ground through the dark ages and
[2:04:15] the grain
[2:04:16] goes into the ground must die it cannot
[2:04:20] produce itself reproduce itself
[2:04:23] and the great church that he established
[2:04:26] in the day of pentecost by the sending
[2:04:28] of the holy ghost had to suffer
[2:04:30] martyrdom so he's explaining the plan of
[2:04:32] god right into the earth the dark ages
[2:04:35] to bring forth
[2:04:37] again in the age of luther and on coming
[2:04:41] up
[2:04:42] to the full statue of the bride of jesus
[2:04:46] christ for this last day
[2:04:55] yes
[2:04:57] and then i he says he goes on and he's
[2:04:59] talking about this growing
[2:05:04] he says and he talked about the world
[2:05:06] i'm just laying this back down to you
[2:05:09] you how you're he says see how it fit to
[2:05:12] you
[2:05:13] in this life as you grew
[2:05:15] everything fit it right in
[2:05:19] so when you're a child you didn't
[2:05:20] understand cars you didn't understand
[2:05:22] what was going on you didn't understand
[2:05:24] any of those things right
[2:05:26] but as you matured
[2:05:29] you began to fit in
[2:05:33] so
[2:05:34] uh okay you begin to understand
[2:05:38] why these things now we are maturing
[2:05:41] right so we should come to the place
[2:05:43] where we understand why we have these
[2:05:45] attributes
[2:05:47] why were oracles
[2:05:49] what's the purpose of it what's the
[2:05:51] purpose of god giving you love and peace
[2:05:53] and joy
[2:05:55] and depends what what what's the
[2:05:58] what's the purpose of of you being a
[2:06:01] savior do you know that you can impart
[2:06:03] eternal life
[2:06:05] that day in calvary
[2:06:09] right by the lane of your hands
[2:06:13] right
[2:06:15] the works that i do
[2:06:17] you shall do also
[2:06:20] all those things are given to you
[2:06:23] they're all giving you to a purpose
[2:06:26] but as we mature
[2:06:28] and as we grow those things are going to
[2:06:31] mean more to us
[2:06:33] now when we begin to understand there's
[2:06:35] a reason that god's given us those
[2:06:37] attributes there's a reason it was
[2:06:39] pre-planned it wasn't just pre-planned
[2:06:42] for here
[2:06:45] it was re-planned for another place
[2:06:49] he says this world and its life seems
[2:06:53] to advance as you mature
[2:06:56] everything seems to go right with you
[2:07:03] he said now i like this he goes on he
[2:07:06] says it's the same
[2:07:08] it isn't plain harps
[2:07:10] i don't believe the bible teaches that
[2:07:13] but that
[2:07:14] was a conception
[2:07:17] that they had before the
[2:07:20] fulfilling of the word come
[2:07:23] to an existence
[2:07:27] till the fullness of the word came into
[2:07:31] existence
[2:07:36] you understand the fullness of the word
[2:07:38] has come into existence
[2:07:42] or the opening of the seven seals
[2:07:45] that's promised to us in this age
[2:07:48] that we
[2:07:49] then
[2:07:50] under
[2:07:53] stand
[2:07:57] so there's an understanding i'm not
[2:07:59] going to go too much farther
[2:08:01] this morning
[2:08:03] because i just want to lay
[2:08:06] the
[2:08:07] the fundamentals
[2:08:09] of us rising above
[2:08:13] our faith rising out of this world
[2:08:17] and have an understanding that the
[2:08:20] character that god's developing you the
[2:08:23] attributes that he's maturing in you
[2:08:28] the gene
[2:08:29] because the spiritual life taps the
[2:08:32] natural life the gene of god as it grew
[2:08:35] up in a child and i i know as a child
[2:08:38] you look at a child so i see a lot of
[2:08:40] its mother i see a lot of its father i
[2:08:43] say but as that child matures more he
[2:08:47] becomes to look more like his father
[2:08:51] or
[2:08:52] her mother
[2:08:54] those those characteristics mature those
[2:08:58] attributes mature they tape on the
[2:09:00] greater form he says the natural life
[2:09:03] and the spiritual life
[2:09:08] run parallel
[2:09:10] they they type one another
[2:09:13] they're the same
[2:09:15] so i'm gonna sum it up by reading a
[2:09:18] couple
[2:09:20] statements
[2:09:21] to you
[2:09:23] that
[2:09:24] it might help
[2:09:26] us to understand
[2:09:29] what is transformative
[2:09:32] inspiring in front of us
[2:09:35] what god's doing what he's showing us
[2:09:40] he's he's he's showing us
[2:09:43] the world to come
[2:09:47] what we
[2:09:49] are going to be like
[2:09:51] in the world to come
[2:09:54] in the world to come we are the
[2:09:56] attributes of god
[2:09:59] and though that world is going to be run
[2:10:02] by the attributes of god
[2:10:05] jesus said if you say to this mountain
[2:10:07] be moved
[2:10:09] and you have faith
[2:10:12] or say to this tree be plucked up and
[2:10:15] put into the sea
[2:10:17] if you had faith it would even be
[2:10:22] as you spoke
[2:10:25] so he's talking about what's going to
[2:10:28] come
[2:10:29] to the church
[2:10:32] so when you when you get over there he's
[2:10:35] saying you're not going to sit on the
[2:10:37] in a cloud
[2:10:39] there's work to be done
[2:10:42] how many automatically you thought work
[2:10:44] to be done you put yourself in a garden
[2:10:49] what if i would say there's worlds to be
[2:10:51] spoken to existence
[2:10:59] if you're going to be like him
[2:11:03] right
[2:11:05] and all that he was what did he do he
[2:11:09] created a world
[2:11:12] did he not
[2:11:14] and he went and lived on it did he not
[2:11:18] didn't he come and manifest the
[2:11:20] attributes of his father
[2:11:25] i'm just trying to get us to think
[2:11:26] outside
[2:11:28] the circle
[2:11:35] didn't he say we be little messiahs
[2:11:39] your messiah
[2:11:41] you think that this world is the only
[2:11:44] world that there ever
[2:11:46] was or is going to be
[2:11:49] do you think that it is possible that
[2:11:51] there's other worlds to come
[2:11:55] that you could speak a world into
[2:11:57] existence
[2:11:59] and go live on it
[2:12:01] that there's going to be work that god's
[2:12:03] planned out for you to do
[2:12:06] that you might be the son he sends to
[2:12:09] another world
[2:12:11] to save another people
[2:12:16] we've got them so limited
[2:12:19] we've got him so tied down you don't
[2:12:21] think that that the attributes that all
[2:12:25] that god was every attribute that was in
[2:12:27] god he put in you
[2:12:31] his very purpose was to express those
[2:12:34] attributes is it beyond our thinking
[2:12:37] that god might call his sons and his
[2:12:39] daughters into another world that they
[2:12:42] also could express those attributes in
[2:12:45] worlds to come
[2:12:50] no we're really what we want's the harp
[2:12:56] that's what we want
[2:12:59] all we want to think about is making it
[2:13:05] could i say it like this we're not even
[2:13:06] developing our skills
[2:13:09] for the next level
[2:13:14] how many anybody athlete or any musician
[2:13:18] or piano player
[2:13:21] you know what it means to go to the next
[2:13:22] level
[2:13:25] you know what it means to develop from
[2:13:27] chopsticks
[2:13:30] to chopin
[2:13:32] to beethoven's paschanada i don't know
[2:13:35] if i said that right
[2:13:39] you know
[2:13:41] what does it take to go to the next
[2:13:43] level
[2:13:50] you've got to hone your mind
[2:13:52] you've got to hone your skills
[2:13:55] any
[2:13:56] sport
[2:13:58] if they talk about at a certain level
[2:14:01] it's now it's all between the ears
[2:14:04] how you think how you approach how you
[2:14:07] look at the situation how you think it
[2:14:10] out in the world of golf you know what
[2:14:13] they call somebody that doesn't think it
[2:14:16] out
[2:14:18] that doesn't look at the distance
[2:14:20] doesn't know the elevation of the club
[2:14:23] can't look at the grass can't determine
[2:14:26] what how it's going to slow down they
[2:14:29] don't they don't plan their shot they
[2:14:31] don't visualize their shot just what's
[2:14:33] going to happen and then if if something
[2:14:36] else happens what's plan b they got
[2:14:39] everything of us approached
[2:14:42] and then they approach the ball the same
[2:14:44] way
[2:14:45] every time they call their routine they
[2:14:48] take the step out some guys plant this
[2:14:50] foot some guys turn this foot some guys
[2:14:53] lean they all got their way that they
[2:14:55] get into that plus and they got it all
[2:14:58] planned out
[2:15:00] you know what they call someone they
[2:15:01] don't plan it out
[2:15:03] they call him a hacker
[2:15:08] he just gets up there and hacks at it
[2:15:11] he don't know where it's going
[2:15:13] he don't know why he's doing what he's
[2:15:15] doing
[2:15:16] he has no conclusion
[2:15:19] do you understand why god's wanting to
[2:15:22] to
[2:15:23] bring these attributes to you
[2:15:26] to the surface
[2:15:29] not for this world
[2:15:33] our job in this world is to express to
[2:15:36] the world
[2:15:37] these attributes
[2:15:40] that's true
[2:15:41] but for us we're going to need these
[2:15:43] attributes to live in the world to come
[2:15:47] because it's going to be governed by
[2:15:48] these attributes you can't have carnal
[2:15:51] thinking there
[2:15:52] but just let's close
[2:15:54] with these things we're just i just
[2:15:56] wanted to
[2:15:57] uh
[2:15:58] you know to get us to
[2:16:00] to
[2:16:02] to uh
[2:16:07] just ex think of
[2:16:10] of things
[2:16:12] beyond this world
[2:16:14] notice
[2:16:16] when jesus created bread
[2:16:19] he took a piece of bread
[2:16:22] this is from the message
[2:16:24] god's gifts always find their place
[2:16:29] notice when jesus created bread this
[2:16:31] paragraph 63
[2:16:35] notice when jesus created bread he took
[2:16:38] a piece of bread
[2:16:39] and created bread
[2:16:41] that had already been
[2:16:44] bred
[2:16:47] when he created fish
[2:16:50] he took a fish
[2:16:51] that was
[2:16:53] first created a fish
[2:16:56] and put another fish out of it
[2:16:59] is that right
[2:17:01] he took water
[2:17:03] which potentially would have become wine
[2:17:07] and made wine out of it
[2:17:10] is that right
[2:17:12] but we've seen him
[2:17:14] in our midst
[2:17:16] in this last day
[2:17:18] create things right out without anything
[2:17:23] standing there
[2:17:28] is that right
[2:17:29] to create a squirrel
[2:17:31] where there is no squirrel
[2:17:34] right
[2:17:36] he remains god
[2:17:38] he's just as much deity day as he was
[2:17:42] then
[2:17:43] and ever was
[2:17:45] or ever will be he's still god
[2:17:49] and challenging our hearts to believe it
[2:17:54] greater things than this
[2:17:57] without anything to hold
[2:18:00] and break off
[2:18:03] speak it and it'll be so
[2:18:06] notice now we find that
[2:18:09] he identified the works that
[2:18:12] he did identified that he was deity
[2:18:16] showed
[2:18:16] that he was for he said if i do not the
[2:18:20] works of my father don't believe me oh
[2:18:24] could not the christians say today if i
[2:18:27] do not the works of my savior believe me
[2:18:30] not
[2:18:32] now what's he showing us
[2:18:35] he's showing us something greater
[2:18:40] something greater than just
[2:18:42] breaking the fish and breaking that it
[2:18:46] was something that came from nothing
[2:18:52] it was greater
[2:18:55] it was farther up the road
[2:18:58] it was more advanced it was more mature
[2:19:04] coming into maturity coming into
[2:19:06] perfection sir don't look at that that
[2:19:09] there's some kind of story
[2:19:13] that's promised to you
[2:19:17] that isn't for somebody some other day
[2:19:20] some other time this is for you
[2:19:23] he's he preaching this to you it's your
[2:19:25] message it was sent to you
[2:19:30] he got it when it when he received it he
[2:19:34] believed it
[2:19:35] he was challenged and he accepted it
[2:19:38] abraham accepted it
[2:19:40] now god's asking you to believe
[2:19:42] something he's giving you a challenge
[2:19:45] he's calling you up to a higher place
[2:19:48] he's calling you to be the attributes of
[2:19:50] god he's calling you because he's
[2:19:52] preparing to leave this place
[2:19:56] oh i'm getting excited
[2:20:00] this is from uh
[2:20:09] this one's from perfect faith
[2:20:13] the great physician who is here
[2:20:16] who said these signs shall follow them
[2:20:19] that believe
[2:20:20] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[2:20:22] shall recover
[2:20:24] if you say to this mountain
[2:20:26] be moved
[2:20:28] and don't doubt in your heart
[2:20:31] we can believe that he can create
[2:20:34] squirrels
[2:20:36] who has no way at all
[2:20:39] or nothing there to believe
[2:20:42] it's my own faith
[2:20:45] that goes and does
[2:20:48] that
[2:20:48] my faith in what he challenged me
[2:20:53] to ask
[2:20:58] he challenged him to ask
[2:21:02] you want squirrels
[2:21:07] speak
[2:21:10] he didn't say take the squirrel
[2:21:13] bless the squirrel
[2:21:16] send that squirrel into the woods
[2:21:20] and out of that squirrel many squirrels
[2:21:22] will appear
[2:21:24] how many would accepted that is a great
[2:21:26] miracle
[2:21:28] but that's not what god did
[2:21:32] god was challenging him
[2:21:36] is that right
[2:21:39] he was challenging him
[2:21:43] to a greater
[2:21:45] level
[2:21:51] i'm looking for another quote that
[2:21:56] jackson would you go and look at my desk
[2:21:58] and see if there's a
[2:21:59] another piece of paper laying in there
[2:22:02] that has this next quote that i'd like
[2:22:05] to read
[2:22:06] he says the great physician
[2:22:09] he said if you say to this mountain
[2:22:13] and doubt not in your heart
[2:22:16] but can believe that he can create
[2:22:18] squirrels
[2:22:20] who has no way at all or nothing there
[2:22:24] to believe it it's my own faith that
[2:22:27] goes and does that my faith in what he
[2:22:30] challenged me to ask
[2:22:34] he challenged me to ask
[2:22:38] it
[2:22:39] and i received his challenge
[2:22:43] in obedience to his word
[2:22:46] and i ask it and it appears
[2:22:50] god in heaven knows that's the truth
[2:22:53] can he also heal the sick
[2:22:56] if he can lift me
[2:22:58] with a faith
[2:23:00] up in this away
[2:23:03] even for the people even if they
[2:23:06] can't climb to that bracket see
[2:23:09] if they
[2:23:10] can't do it he can use my faith
[2:23:14] he can
[2:23:15] lift me
[2:23:16] to that place
[2:23:18] and i'll climb
[2:23:21] i'll
[2:23:22] i'm climbing for you
[2:23:25] i'm believing for you
[2:23:27] i'm speaking for
[2:23:29] you
[2:23:38] did you hear what he said
[2:23:39] i'm speaking for you i'm climbing there
[2:23:42] for you why
[2:23:45] why because he's wanting us to climb
[2:23:48] there we're not talking some of this
[2:23:51] pokey pokey stuff
[2:23:52] you're gonna walk out there and you're
[2:23:54] gonna say i'm gonna speak the word
[2:23:58] no he's talking about
[2:24:02] the reason he's building attributes
[2:24:05] the reason he's building character
[2:24:08] power apart from character is what
[2:24:12] satanic he's trying to rise our thinking
[2:24:16] above the circle
[2:24:18] the world calls it a box
[2:24:21] we we consider the world
[2:24:24] right round
[2:24:27] trying to get us to believe outside the
[2:24:29] world
[2:24:30] that all things are possible
[2:24:34] if there wasn't a law
[2:24:38] to that
[2:24:40] sons and daughters of god
[2:24:42] would create them a world
[2:24:45] out here
[2:24:46] and go
[2:24:47] live a private life on it
[2:24:51] you have the power
[2:24:53] in you to do it
[2:24:56] if you've got a shadow of the power of
[2:24:58] god in you
[2:25:00] you've got power to do that
[2:25:02] god is omnipotent you see what i mean
[2:25:06] the power that's in you
[2:25:09] will make
[2:25:10] you could speak a world into existence
[2:25:14] and go live on it hallelujah
[2:25:17] there you are
[2:25:19] that's what power is in the church now
[2:25:22] but is controlled by a law
[2:25:29] what do you think we're leaving
[2:25:32] we're leaving those laws of sin and
[2:25:34] death
[2:25:35] we're going into a world
[2:25:41] that is not encumbered with any belief
[2:25:44] or doubt
[2:25:45] well all things are possible
[2:25:48] where we'll work
[2:25:55] and we're closing the musicians can come
[2:26:01] i believe that heaven is a real place
[2:26:06] the same as this is a real place
[2:26:10] see
[2:26:10] god started us
[2:26:13] in our spiritual growth
[2:26:15] in
[2:26:16] this
[2:26:17] place
[2:26:21] right
[2:26:22] he started us in our spiritual growth in
[2:26:25] this place
[2:26:27] and i believe that heaven is a place
[2:26:29] just as real as this
[2:26:32] where we don't set up there for eternity
[2:26:36] and just sit there on a cloud
[2:26:40] look if i would say the cloud and we
[2:26:43] just don't sit there
[2:26:48] we just don't get to heaven and sit
[2:26:51] there
[2:26:52] i'm in heaven now
[2:26:56] no
[2:26:57] you've got attributes to
[2:27:00] express you're made in the image
[2:27:04] the first son
[2:27:06] created
[2:27:08] every son and daughter if they're equal
[2:27:11] to sons and daughters
[2:27:12] they'll be doing the same works the
[2:27:14] works that i do
[2:27:16] shall you do also why do we put a period
[2:27:19] on that and stop it here
[2:27:27] how many ever take that scripture out of
[2:27:29] this world
[2:27:32] however take those things beyond this
[2:27:35] place
[2:27:36] you see what i'm trying to say
[2:27:38] it's like there's a world around us a
[2:27:41] realm around us that we never go beyond
[2:27:44] we never think we look for everything in
[2:27:46] the scriptures is all going to transpire
[2:27:50] in this world but it hasn't even entered
[2:27:52] into our hearts and our minds the things
[2:27:55] that god prepared for them there's a lot
[2:27:58] more on the other side than there is
[2:28:00] here
[2:28:02] we're just getting our spiritual growth
[2:28:06] in this place
[2:28:09] we're getting our character
[2:28:11] we're getting to exercise we're getting
[2:28:14] to mature into the attributes we're
[2:28:16] getting to mature into turning the cheek
[2:28:19] going the extra mile doing the things
[2:28:21] he's building us that stature of a
[2:28:24] perfect man in christ not for this world
[2:28:27] but for the world to come
[2:28:35] we don't just strum a harp
[2:28:40] for all
[2:28:42] all from here
[2:28:44] ever
[2:28:46] we're going to a real place
[2:28:50] where we're going
[2:28:52] to do things
[2:28:58] what things
[2:29:01] the things
[2:29:04] that your attributes
[2:29:07] express
[2:29:13] i'm done doing things
[2:29:16] in this world
[2:29:19] i can't pick up what i used to pick up
[2:29:22] i can't walk as far as i walk
[2:29:25] i certainly can't run
[2:29:28] i have to use two hands to get one leg
[2:29:31] out of bed
[2:29:34] i'm not living i'm not even being formed
[2:29:37] for this world
[2:29:39] if this earthly body be destroyed
[2:29:42] i've got one waiting
[2:29:46] what's going to be going into that body
[2:29:49] what's the spiritual life of that body
[2:29:51] going to be like
[2:29:53] it's going to be a statue of a perfect
[2:29:55] man it's going to be possessing the
[2:29:58] attributes of god
[2:30:07] we're going to it
[2:30:09] he says we're going to work we're going
[2:30:12] to enjoy
[2:30:13] we're going to live
[2:30:16] a paradise
[2:30:17] just like adam and eve worked and lived
[2:30:20] and eat and enjoyed in the garden of
[2:30:23] eden
[2:30:24] before sin came in what did they do
[2:30:27] the prophet of god said they named
[2:30:29] animals they said this tree
[2:30:32] be planted there
[2:30:37] he says it's like mountains he says he
[2:30:39] said that they just it's later on in
[2:30:41] this book he talks about just throwing
[2:30:44] out
[2:30:45] mud out in the mountains
[2:30:49] he says but some people love mountains
[2:30:52] some people love seas
[2:30:54] some people love things what do you
[2:30:56] think you're going to do
[2:30:58] when you get there
[2:31:02] you're going to say to the beach
[2:31:06] you might find me on the sand
[2:31:08] somewhere
[2:31:10] and i'm going to say waves i want you
[2:31:12] six feet high
[2:31:15] see i want you flat today
[2:31:19] and i'm gonna walk out on the water
[2:31:23] and i'm gonna talk to the purposes
[2:31:27] when i walk up to the whale
[2:31:30] oh you think i'm crazy
[2:31:34] come out of your world
[2:31:37] come out of your limitations
[2:31:39] i'm going to walk on water and i'm going
[2:31:41] to talk to whales
[2:31:44] they talk about the horse whisperer i'll
[2:31:46] be the fish whisperer
[2:31:49] i'm going someplace
[2:31:51] i've got a god that's prepared something
[2:31:53] that my heart's longing for
[2:31:56] i'm not going to be hung up i'm not
[2:31:58] going to have the fleshly hang-ups
[2:32:00] of this sinful flesh
[2:32:07] adam
[2:32:08] talk to the trees and
[2:32:10] he named the animals
[2:32:13] this is just me thinking
[2:32:16] i wonder how many of those animals
[2:32:19] when he said lion
[2:32:22] a lion came
[2:32:24] and adam said this is a lion
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:30] this is a zebra
[2:32:33] or whatever he called him
[2:32:36] he was a son of god
[2:32:38] he was a gene of god
[2:32:41] he had the attributes of god he created
[2:32:44] a paradise
[2:32:50] if we didn't have the law of god what
[2:32:52] would we do
[2:32:53] [Music]
[2:32:56] we'd go create a world
[2:32:58] i believe we're going to do that
[2:33:00] church
[2:33:05] before sin came in
[2:33:07] we're on our road right back there again
[2:33:10] right
[2:33:13] there again
[2:33:14] right right back
[2:33:16] the first adam
[2:33:17] through sin taken us out
[2:33:20] the second adam
[2:33:22] through justification
[2:33:24] brings us
[2:33:26] back in again
[2:33:28] justified us
[2:33:29] and brings us
[2:33:32] back
[2:33:33] in
[2:33:41] i i just
[2:33:42] [Music]
[2:33:45] i
[2:33:46] i just believe everything he's trying to
[2:33:48] do with me now
[2:33:50] everything he's trying to clean out
[2:33:53] everything he's trying to put in
[2:33:56] because we're at the end
[2:33:59] and he's preparing us
[2:34:01] for the kingdom
[2:34:03] to come
[2:34:04] in my father's house
[2:34:06] are many mansions
[2:34:08] if it were not so i would not have told
[2:34:11] you
[2:34:13] heaven and earth will pass away
[2:34:15] but my word
[2:34:17] will not
[2:34:18] pass away
[2:34:21] [Music]
[2:34:28] he's not preparing you to stay church
[2:34:32] that's why he's working on you so hard
[2:34:35] he's preparing for you to leave
[2:34:40] he's preparing your
[2:34:42] spirit for another body
[2:34:46] and that theophany body will only
[2:34:49] receive
[2:34:50] his spirit
[2:34:54] it's created
[2:34:56] for that and you were created
[2:35:00] to be the inhabitants
[2:35:03] of the next world
[2:35:06] that's what he's asking you to believe
[2:35:09] you are in this world but you are not of
