[16:12] have a father who sees this, Lord God.
[16:14] And heavenly father, if there be one who

[16:20] portion to them. Lord, if it [music] be
[16:22] through the song service, the preaching,
[16:24] Lord, we believe you can give it, Lord.
[16:26] And heavenly father, we pray that your

[16:30] Lord, that you would just let him arrive
[16:32] back safely, [music] Lord. that Lord,
[16:34] you just had on his heart. So go out
[16:35] there and minister, Lord. Lord, we pray
[16:38] that once more you just keep him safe,

[23:22] Oh [singing] Lord, [music] every fear of
[23:26] me.
[23:28] Amen.
[23:30] Amen. Is that your heart desire tonight?
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Gracious
[23:34] Father,
[23:36] your feeling is what we desire, Lord.
[23:38] And we understand that what we have need
[23:41] of, we can't find it, Father, anywhere
[23:44] else but to you, Lord.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; We gathered here, Lord, as a people
[23:48] that's hungry for you. Father, a people
[23:51] expecting the rapture, a people that's
[23:53] been prepared for an event that is to
[23:55] come, Lord, we have one heart desire,
[23:58] and that is your, you may be made known
[24:01] unto us, Lord, and that our lives may
[24:04] reflect who you are, Father. That every
[24:06] action that we make may be a reflection
[24:09] of who you are, Lord. I know that we
[24:11] have so much humanity that we carry
[24:14] around. [music] But Lord, we have a
[24:16] promise tonight that if we believe that
[24:18] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[24:21] the dead, if it dwelleth in us, it will
[24:24] also quicken our mortal bodies. Lord, we
[24:26] ask that you do that because that spirit
[24:29] is the spirit of the word. We invite you
[24:31] that you may just come and take this few
[24:33] words that we're going to speak and
[24:35] Lord, let it be multiplied into our
[24:37] hearts that it may produce the life of
[24:39] Christ. We thank you for those that will
[24:41] be able to make it in the house of God.
[24:43] And Father, I pray that you strengthen
[24:46] them and you give them that they may not
[24:48] go out of here the same way they came.
[24:50] And Father, that you may add a portion
[24:52] to what they are, Lord. And that you
[24:54] may, Father, do something special for
[24:56] them, oh God. And Lord, those that
[24:58] couldn't be here, we commit them to you.
[25:01] Father, you said that no man can come
[25:03] unto me unless I call. And we know that,
[25:06] Father, even our very words will fall
[25:08] flat. There's only one that can convert
[25:10] the hearts. That is you, the Lord Jesus
[25:13] Christ. So I pray you lead us and guide
[25:15] us for whatever we have need of. Let it
[25:18] be sat. Let us be satisfied at your
[25:20] table, Lord. And that everything that we
[25:22] look for, Lord, it may be found when we
[25:24] come and we dine with you. Take this
[25:27] service, Lord, and just touch each one,
[25:29] oh father, even now, Lord, and that the
[25:32] words of eternal life may come and be
[25:35] imparted to us. We commit everything we
[25:37] are and ask this in the name of the Lord
[25:39] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So good to be
[25:46] gather in the house of God. We're going
[25:47] to continue to remember our pastor.
[25:49] Don't forget to text him tomorrow for
[25:51] his birthday. Like brother Matthew said,
[25:53] you could start today and text tomorrow.
[25:55] So it's always wonderful. and and I was
[25:58] I had a chance to watch I believe one or
[26:00] two services and it was marvelous uh
[26:03] just uh the things that's moving in his
[26:05] heart to share with the bride around the
[26:08] world. Amen. Let's open our Bibles.
[26:11] Amen. I'm really enjoy service this
[26:13] morning.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you the word of God is
[26:17] given to us for us to live by. Let's
[26:20] open our Bibles. We're going to read
[26:21] couple of scriptures and and be seated.
[26:24] Uh let's read the very familiar
[26:26] scripture first. John chapter 1.
[26:30] John the 1 chapter
[26:39] says in the beginning was the word and
[26:42] the word was with God and the word was
[26:44] God. The same was in the beginning with
[26:47] God. All things that were made
[26:51] were made by him and without him was not
[26:55] anything made that was made. In him was
[26:58] life and life was light of man and the
[27:02] light shineth in darkness and darkness
[27:05] comprehended not. There was a man sent
[27:08] from God who was uh whose name was John.
[27:12] The same came for witness to bear
[27:15] witness of the light that all men
[27:18] through him might believe. He was not
[27:21] that light, but he was sent to bear
[27:24] witness of the light. That was the true
[27:27] light which lightth every man that
[27:31] cometh unto the world. He was in the
[27:34] world and the world He was in the world
[27:38] and the world was made by him and the
[27:41] world knew him not. He came unto his own
[27:44] and his own receive him not. But as many
[27:47] as receive him, to them give he the
[27:51] power to become sons and daughters, even
[27:54] to them that believe on his name.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Keep your
[28:00] Bibles open. And we're also going to
[28:02] read in Romans. We're going to read a
[28:05] couple of verses in Romans chapter 9 7
[28:08] and 8.
[28:10] It said neither because it says neither
[28:13] because they that are seed that the seed
[28:17] of Abraham are this are they all
[28:22] neither because they are the seed of
[28:24] Abraham are they all children. But in
[28:28] Isaac shall thy seed be called. For that
[28:31] is they which are the children of the
[28:35] flesh, these are not the children of
[28:38] God, but the children of the promise are
[28:42] counted for the seed.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to perhaps a strange title.
[28:50] It's amazing. We were in the back
[28:52] fellowshipping and it looks like it was
[28:56] just something within my heart that uh
[28:59] some of the brethrens were thinking
[29:00] about the same on the same vein and that
[29:03] is I want to speak on the word made
[29:07] flesh in you.
[29:09] The call for the word of God to be made
[29:12] flesh in our time. The word made flesh
[29:16] in you. And I want to just start out by
[29:19] saying that that within the hour that we
[29:23] are living in, it's the hour of the
[29:26] manifestation.
[29:28] Uh brother Bam will talk about the seed
[29:32] that was sown and there was the time for
[29:35] sewing. There was a time where the word
[29:38] had to go in the ground. But we find out
[29:41] that in the end time we've come right
[29:45] back to seed time again. And the f the
[29:49] the time that we are living in the
[29:51] prophet is wanting us to be mindful that
[29:54] the word that was sown in the beginning
[29:58] is coming to be manifested again. And
[30:00] you'll find out in most of the time when
[30:02] the prophet talks and and when he
[30:05] preaches even in reference to the time
[30:07] that we are living in he's not warning
[30:10] you to just look and say that oh we are
[30:13] going back to what Pentecost was but
[30:16] it's actually in certain place it will
[30:18] tell you that we are back right back
[30:20] into the garden of Eden.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; We are right back into what the
[30:25] beginning of all the things was. And we
[30:28] understand the prophet will tell us
[30:30] there's two books that the devil hates
[30:32] is the book of Genesis and the book of
[30:34] Revelation because one will tell us
[30:38] exactly how his beginning was. His
[30:41] desire to uh uh uh mess with the seed is
[30:46] his desire to corrupt the seed. And the
[30:49] book of Revelation will tell us how
[30:51] everything ends. And I could say tonight
[30:54] that when we come to the church of God,
[30:56] we are happy because we know how the
[30:59] story is going to end.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; We are not left in darkness to figure
[31:02] out which is our part, how we're going
[31:04] to end up. We are a people that's been
[31:07] privileged to know how the story end.
[31:10] And we are reading knowing that our ends
[31:14] will be prosperous. We are reading. We
[31:16] are studying knowing that we've already
[31:18] made it. We were reading knowing that
[31:21] there's something in us that's calling
[31:23] for what that which we know will be
[31:25] manifested when all is said and done. So
[31:28] we as we read we we kind of have to
[31:30] understand that we are the children of
[31:33] the promise. If the word is to be
[31:36] manifested we are here manifesting the
[31:39] word of God. If the word was to produce
[31:42] a child in the end time if there was to
[31:44] be a bride but said you don't look and
[31:47] say that my pastor is the bride. You
[31:49] said, "I'm the bride." If there has to
[31:51] be one, I am that one. That's the kind
[31:54] of time we're living in where you have
[31:56] to put everything in. Like our brother
[31:58] Matthew said this morning, it's not the
[32:00] time uh to Peter patter or try to find
[32:04] or or or misjudge or be lukewarm. It's
[32:08] the time where you have to put
[32:10] everything. It's the time where you have
[32:12] to believe everything. It's a time where
[32:15] we are called to be the very elected of
[32:18] God. And I have some things I'm going to
[32:21] read here, but I just want to lay a
[32:22] foundation. So God opened our eyes in
[32:26] this end time for us to see the
[32:27] deception that's happening. And I want
[32:30] to just call out to say if you're
[32:32] sitting here in this building tonight,
[32:34] it's not by your effort that you came
[32:36] in. It's by God's desire for you to be
[32:38] here. Amen.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; It it it I I I've always feel within my
[32:44] heart, even in my own life, the word of
[32:47] God is the foundation on which we can
[32:50] stand. If we ever find out that the way
[32:53] we came to Christ is by was by our own
[32:55] effort, our effort will end somewhere.
[32:58] Our effort will go will take us only a
[33:01] certain distance. But if you can come to
[33:03] the realization that it was God working
[33:06] everything for your good, then it's
[33:08] going to take you farther than you ever
[33:09] want to be. Why? Because if we do
[33:12] something just by our own effort, those
[33:14] effort will seize. But if it's done by
[33:17] the word of God, it's eternal. That
[33:19] which will stand when the world even as
[33:22] the scripture says, heaven and earth
[33:23] will pass away, but my word will never
[33:26] pass away. So the same way as the
[33:29] scripture said, he said that he came to
[33:31] Abraham, he said that I have come again
[33:34] to you that in next year that Sarah will
[33:36] have a child. We need to believe as we
[33:39] sitting here that the same way the
[33:42] promise was made unto Abraham for him to
[33:44] have Isaac. The same way the promise is
[33:47] made in this time for us to be the
[33:49] bride.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Now I and I just want to compare the two
[33:52] so you can really understand. The
[33:55] promise is made unto Abraham and God
[33:58] waits for Abraham and Sarah to die. God
[34:02] waits for Abraham and Sarah to lose the
[34:05] natural ability to have a child. God
[34:08] waits until they are at the very hands.
[34:11] God waits until there's no possibility
[34:14] for them to have a child. Then at that
[34:16] time, God decides to give them a child.
[34:19] So when they had that baby, they could
[34:21] look at him. Abraham could look at the
[34:24] baby. Sarah could hold the baby and know
[34:26] that this baby, I got him by the promise
[34:29] of God. This baby, I had no power, NO NO
[34:34] DESIRE, NO anything within me to bring a
[34:37] child. If I'm holding this baby, is only
[34:39] by the grace of God. And let me tell
[34:42] you, it's no different from us sitting
[34:44] here tonight. If you're going TO BE A
[34:46] BRIDE OF CHRIST in this end time, you
[34:48] will have to look at yourself and know
[34:51] that WITHIN MY OWN SELF, THERE IS NO
[34:54] OUNCE OF POWER TO BRING FORTH a bride.
[34:57] It's only by the grace of God.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; It's only by the grace of God. It It's
[35:05] not anything that we can do. It's not by
[35:08] anything we can produce. And I want to
[35:10] say this brotherham said this and I
[35:12] thought this was so marvelous even with
[35:14] what we heard this morning. He says that
[35:16] the word will correct the air. The word
[35:20] will correct the air. I THOUGHT, OH MY
[35:23] BROTHER, MY SISTER, IF YOU CAN APPLY THE
[35:26] WORD OF GOD, NOT ON YOUR FLESH, NOT ON
[35:29] YOUR FLESH, APPLY THE WORD OF GOD into
[35:31] your heart, whatever the error is IN
[35:34] YOUR LIFE, GOD WILL CORRECT IT.
[35:38] Thank you.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; We we WE THE THE TROUBLE WE RUN INTO
[35:42] MOST OF THE TIME IS WHEN THE word is
[35:44] preached, we look at ourselves for the
[35:47] manifestation. We look at the flesh AND
[35:50] TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BETTER the
[35:52] flesh. And let me tell you this, you
[35:54] will never perfect the flesh. What you
[35:56] need to DO IS APPLY THE WORD TO YOUR
[35:58] HEART AND LET YOUR HEART PRODUCE THE
[36:01] LIFE THAT WOULD TAKE THE FLESH UNDER
[36:03] SUBJECTION.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; That's the PROCESS OF GOD. WHEN WE HEAR
[36:07] THE WORD OF GOD, WE ARE CALLED TO BE A
[36:09] BRIDE. AND I KNOW I SAID THE ONLY WAY I
[36:12] CAN PRODUCE A BRIDE IS TO DIE WITH MY
[36:14] own self. JUST LIKE ABRAHAM, GOD IS
[36:17] WAITING FOR US TO DIE WITHIN OUR OWN
[36:19] IDEAS. He's waiting FOR YOU TO DIE WITH
[36:22] YOUR OWN THOUGHTS AND YOUR OWN STRENGTH.
[36:24] HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO look at YOURSELF
[36:26] AND SAY, "LORD, YOU SAID THIS AND I KNOW
[36:29] WITHIN MY OWN SELF, THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
[36:31] ATTAIN TO THIS." AND HE looks at you AND
[36:34] HE SAID, "THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WANT
[36:35] YOU TO BE.
[36:40] GOD IS NOT LOOKING FOR A BUNCH of uh uh
[36:43] stronger PEOPLE THAT WILL GO AND DO.
[36:45] HE'S LOOKING FOR THE WEAKEST AMONG US.
[36:48] ONE WHO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING
[36:50] TO OFFER. ONE WHO CAN COME AND GO ON AND
[36:52] HE SAID, "LORD, IF YOU DON'T HELP ME,
[36:55] I'M LOST."
[36:56] &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO THAT ONE. THAT'S THE
[36:59] MATERIAL IS GOING TO WORK WITH. AND
[37:01] THEREFORE WITHIN OUR OWN HEART WHEN THE
[37:03] WORD IS PREACHED WE HAVE TO TAKE IT AND
[37:05] APPLY IT TO OUR HEART AND SAY LORD YOU
[37:08] CALLING ME TO A HIGHER CALLING. YOU
[37:10] CALLING ME TO A BETTER LIFE. YOU CALLING
[37:12] ME TO WHATEVER. LET YOUR WORD FIX THE
[37:15] error into my life. LET ME SAY THIS.
[37:17] ONCE YOU'VE COME IN CONTACT WITH THE
[37:19] LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, IT WILL
[37:21] CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody has to ask you to come to church.
[37:26] YOU WILL COME TO CHURCH.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; NOBODY HAS TO ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING.
[37:29] YOU'LL DO IT. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S NO
[37:32] LONGER ABOUT SOME REGULATION. IT'S A
[37:34] HEARTBEAT DESIRE THAT WANTS TO PLEASE
[37:37] GOD WITH everything within you.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of Christian I WANT TO
[37:41] BE. NOT ONE THAT'S BORN BY REGULATION.
[37:44] THAT'S WHY I'M SAID THIS. HE SAID WHEN
[37:46] GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE, BECAUSE EVE
[37:50] WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL, GOD PLACED
[37:53] HER TO HER FOR HER TO be behind the
[37:55] word. So, HE GAVE HER THE WORD FOR
[37:58] PROTECTION. AND I BEGAN TO THINK EVEN
[38:01] our own self. THE REASON WHY WE FIND IT
[38:04] HARD to live the life of Christ IS
[38:06] BECAUSE THERE'S NO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
[38:09] THE PURPOSE WHY THE WORD WAS GIVEN. BUT
[38:12] IF WE CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND IT'S FOR OUR
[38:14] PROTECTION. IT'S FOR OUR GOOD. IT'S NOT
[38:17] TO HURT US BUT IT'S TO PROSPER US. AND
[38:20] HE CAME AND HE SAID BUT SHE FOUND THE
[38:23] WAY BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT ONE WITH THAT
[38:25] WORD. SHE FOUND THE WAY. THE ENEMY FOUND
[38:28] THE WAY TO COME AROUND the word and
[38:31] deceive her. BUT SAID, "BUT WHEN GOD
[38:33] BUILT THE SECOND MASTERPIECE, SHE WAS
[38:36] NOT BEHIND THE WORD, BUT SHE WAS MADE
[38:39] THE WORD ITSELF."
[38:42] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE SHE BECAME THE WORD ITSELF,
[38:44] THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD DECEIVE IT.
[38:47] WHY? BECAUSE HER THINKING WAS THE WORD.
[38:49] HER SPEECH WAS THE WORD. EVERYTHING
[38:51] ABOUT HER WAS THE WORD. AND IF GOD
[38:54] CANNOT FAIL, SHE CANNOT FAIL ALSO.
[39:00] We we we
[39:03] find it hard because when we hear the
[39:06] word of God and
[39:09] we we try to apply it and we find it,
[39:13] oh, how am I going to I need a better
[39:15] way for me to be to make it to church. I
[39:17] need to do this. Let me say this as a
[39:20] word of advice. Commit it to the Lord.
[39:24] Let your word, let your heart be known
[39:26] unto him and let him make a way of
[39:29] escape for you.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; If you try to make your own way of
[39:32] escape, you will only come up with a
[39:34] disaster. But you utilize his word of
[39:38] escape, which is his word. You take his
[39:40] word back to him and he said, "Lord, YOU
[39:42] SAID THIS. YOU SAID WHEN THE HOUSE OF
[39:45] GOD IS OPEN, I SHOULD BE THERE." YOU
[39:47] SAID THAT THE JUST SHALL NOT BREAK
[39:48] BREAD. YOU USE HIS WORD AND GO BACK TO
[39:51] HIM. THAT WORD WILL OPEN UP A WAY OF
[39:53] ESCAPE FOR YOU.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; We can certainly say it's not by OUR OWN
[40:01] DESIRE. I DIDN'T DESIRE TO become a
[40:04] preacher.
[40:06] I've said it time and time again. IT
[40:08] WASN'T BECAUSE IT WAS AND IN FACT I
[40:11] HATED IT.
[40:14] I I hated IT WITH PASSION. I I WAS NO
[40:17] FRIENDS WITH PREACHERS.
[40:21] SEE THE YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
[40:24] GOD'S DESIRE IS STRONGER THAN OUR EVEN
[40:26] OUR OWN DESIRE.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SIT THERE YOU SAY I WANT TO BE A
[40:30] CHRISTIAN BUT SAID GOD WANTS TO BLESS
[40:33] YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN EVER DESIRED.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT ABOUT I LOVE WHAT OUR
[40:39] BROTHER MATTHEW SAID OUR HEART IS A
[40:41] DECEITFUL THING. THE HEART WILL MAKE AN
[40:43] EXCUSE. RIGHT?
[40:46] &gt;&gt; OH, I I I WANT TO DO THIS, BUT THEN
[40:48] THIS, BUT THEN NO, HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT
[40:51] ALL OF THAT. HE WANTS YOU TO ACCEPT THE
[40:53] WORD AND LET HIM MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; A TRUE BELIEVER, GOD MAKES THE
[40:59] DIFFERENCE FOR WHAT WE CAN.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE WEAK, HE'S MADE STRONG. WHEN
[41:04] WE FAIL, HE CAN LIFT US UP. WHERE WE
[41:06] WE'RE SICK, HE CAN MAKE US WHOLE. HE'S
[41:09] THERE TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.
[41:13] HE'S NOT THERE TO CONDEMN US. HE'S THERE
[41:16] SO HE CAN TAKE YOU. SO YOU CAN KNOW LIKE
[41:19] ABRAHAM AND SARAH, I'M HOLDING THIS
[41:22] BABY, BUT I'M DEAD. THIS BABY IS THE
[41:26] PRODUCT of God giving me life
[41:29] &gt;&gt; and not by my own self.
[41:35] So
[41:36] the same way with Mary, he will come and
[41:39] he said, "Behold, a virgin shall
[41:42] conceive
[41:43] and it will come to pass and it will
[41:47] talk and by the mouth of Isaiah, God
[41:50] will speak his word and said, "A virgin
[41:52] shall conceive."
[41:54] And Mary will LOOK AND SAID, "HOW SHALL
[41:57] THIS BE?"
[41:59] And the angel will speak unto him and
[42:02] say, "Behold thy handmmaids." It said,
[42:06] it said, "The Holy Spirit shall
[42:08] overshadow thee, and you shall become
[42:10] the one that will bear the the child of
[42:13] the Almighty." And she will look at it,
[42:16] however crazy it sounded. She will lift
[42:18] up her hands and say, "Be unto me
[42:21] according to thy word." I IT'S NOT BY
[42:25] STRENGTH. IT'S BY SURRENDER. IT'S NOT BY
[42:28] WHAT WE CAN OFFER. IT'S BY SURRENDERING
[42:30] TO HIM. IT'S BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE
[42:33] WORD IS RIGHT. IT'S BY ACKNOWLEDGING
[42:36] THAT THE WORD IS TRUE. IT'S BY
[42:38] ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE KNOWS THE WAY WE
[42:40] DON'T. IT'S BY SURRENDERING TO HIM AND
[42:43] TAKING HIS PROVIDED WAY THAT WE get to
[42:46] what we want, what we need.
[42:53] So the prophet was speaking. For the
[42:56] purpose of time, I'll just try to
[42:59] to to shrink this up really quickly and
[43:03] and you can go back and look at it and
[43:06] and and read it and find it more
[43:09] expanded in the message.
[43:11] The the the word made flesh
[43:16] when we we understand that it's God's
[43:19] desire. But says even from the beginning
[43:22] it was always God wanted to become
[43:25] human.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; He said he wanted to have a family. God
[43:29] wanted to be a family man FROM THE
[43:31] BEGINNING. HE NEVER HE WANTED TO SHARE
[43:34] HIS GLORY with his people. HE NEVER
[43:37] WANTED TO BE ONE THAT SEATED ON THE
[43:39] THRONE and and and with ANGEL WORSHIPING
[43:41] HIM. THAT WAS WONDERFUL. BUT HE WANTED
[43:44] TO HAVE ONE THAT WAS OVER EVEN MORE LIKE
[43:47] HIM HIMSELF MANIFESTED AND THAT WAS
[43:50] ALWAYS HIS DESIRE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT
[43:53] IN VIEW OF THAT WE WILL SAY THAT WE WE
[43:57] HAVE A PROPHECY IN THE END TIME THAT WE
[43:59] ARE CALLED TO BE THE CHILDREN AND THE
[44:01] BRIDE OF CHRIST. And I just want to read
[44:04] some of the things THAT THE PROPHET
[44:06] TALKED ABOUT BECOMING IN the hour that
[44:09] we are living in. HE SAYS CHRIST IS THE
[44:12] word and the word is in the bride. How
[44:16] many believe the word is in the bride?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; The bride is continuous is the
[44:21] continuation of the same word that was
[44:24] made flesh in Christ.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; WE WE WE ARE NOT TO BE CALLED TO BE A
[44:30] DIFFERENT WORD BUT THE SAME WORD THAT
[44:32] WAS MANIFESTED IN CHRIST. THE SAME WORD
[44:35] THAT WALKED IN IN IN ON THE ROADS OF
[44:38] GALILEE. THE SAME WORD THAT WAS
[44:40] MANIFESTED IN THE BODY OF FLESH CALLED
[44:43] JESUS. THAT SAME WORD, WE ARE THE
[44:46] CONTINUATION OF THAT SAME WORD.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; NO DIFFERENCE. THE SAME WORD IS TO BE
[44:51] MANIFESTED. SO JUST AS CHRIST WAS MADE,
[44:54] THE WORD MADE FLESH IN HIS DAY. SO THE
[44:57] BRIDE BECOME THE LIVING EXPRESSION OF
[45:00] THAT SAME WORD TODAY.
[45:05] the same living EXPRESSION
[45:08] &gt;&gt; WITH THE SAME POWER
[45:10] &gt;&gt; WITH THE SAME HUMILITY with the same
[45:13] nature. Let me SAY THIS MY BROTHER AND
[45:15] MY SISTER WE HAVE NOT COME TO SOME
[45:17] CUNNINGLY DEVICES WE'VE COME TO THE
[45:20] REALITY OF THE LIVING GOD. IF THE WORD
[45:23] HAS TO BE MANIFESTED IN THIS AGE, THE
[45:26] PROMISE IS THAT IT WILL PRODUCE THE
[45:28] FULLNESS,
[45:30] &gt;&gt; NOT HALFWAY, THE FULLNESS OF WHAT GOD
[45:32] WAS.
[45:45] But I just gave you the formula. It's
[45:47] not you. It's him doing it.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; SO, SO DON'T DON'T FEEL SHY. DON'T DON'T
[45:53] COMPARE YOURSELF. JUST ACCEPT IT AND LET
[45:55] HIM BRING THE RESULT.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; WE ARE TO BE JESUS. IT SAYS JESUS IS THE
[46:00] WORD MADE FLESH. And as he WAS FIRST IN
[46:04] HIS SO THE BRIDE IS TO BE THE LIVING
[46:07] EXPRESSION OF THAT SAME WORD TODAY, NOT
[46:10] A DIFFERENT DAY. THIS DAY.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST. BUT WHEN
[46:14] WILL SAY GOD ABOVE US, GOD WITH US IN
[46:17] THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST AND IN THE END
[46:20] TIME SAID THAT HE WAS TO POUR OUT OF
[46:23] HIMSELF. AND SAYS TO POUR, IT WAS NOT AN
[46:27] EMPTYING OUT, BUT IT'S GOD CHANGING THE
[46:30] FORM.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGING FORMS. GOD INSTEAD OF JUST
[46:37] A MAN JESUS CHRIST, HE'S TAKEN THE SAME
[46:40] LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM, POURED INTO A
[46:42] PEOPLE THAT CAN BECOME JUST LIKE HIM,
[46:46] &gt;&gt; TALK LIKE HIM, WALK LIKE HIM, BEHAVE
[46:49] LIKE HIM,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; THE TROUBLE WITH US IS WE LOOK FOR
[46:54] POWER, WE LIVE THE LIFE OUT. YOU TAKE
[46:57] THE LIFE, THE LIFE WILL PRODUCE THE
[46:59] POWER.
[47:05] She carries his nature, his life, his
[47:08] spirit, NO IMITATION, BUT THE true
[47:13] manifestation. Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; WHEN THOSE THAT WERE MET FORTH that came
[47:19] out of Pentecost, when they looked at
[47:23] them, it wasn't because they cut their
[47:26] beards like Jesus did and they they had
[47:29] the same haircut that Jesus did and it
[47:32] wasn't because they talked the same way
[47:35] and, you know, they move the same way or
[47:37] or preach perhaps the same way THAT
[47:39] JESUS PREACHED. NO, IT WAS THE
[47:42] MANIFESTED LIFE THAT CAME OUT OF THEM
[47:46] WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THEM. THE WAY THEY
[47:49] CONDUCTED THEMSELVES, THEY LOOKED AT
[47:51] THEM AND THEY KNEW that these have been
[47:54] with Christ.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; And if WE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT SAME LIFE
[47:58] IN THE END TIME, IT'S NOT BY HOW WE
[48:01] LOOK. IT'S NOT BY WHERE WE COME FROM,
[48:04] BUT IT'S BY THE SAME LIFE LIVING INSIDE
[48:07] OF US manifesting the same Christ.
[48:11] THE WHOLE THERE'S THE WHOLE
[48:15] THE WHOLE OF THIS IS BUT SAY IT'S GOD
[48:19] ALL OF THIS THE TOTALITY OF this it's
[48:23] God's desire to become tangible.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; God becoming tangible.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; God making himself visible.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said uh not so long
[48:40] he said the world shall see me no more
[48:42] but ye shall see me because I live it
[48:45] shall live also because I will be with
[48:48] you even in you until the end. Andam
[48:52] says at that day ye shall know THAT THE
[48:56] SAME WAY I AM IN THE FATHER AND THE
[48:58] FATHER IN I THAT ME AND THE FATHER WILL
[49:01] COME AND DWELL IN YOU. AMEN.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; The oneness of Christ,
[49:06] &gt;&gt; us becoming one with the word.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; And and let me say this, it's by
[49:12] humility. It's by the life of Christ
[49:15] manifesting itself.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; I just realized we won't be we won't be
[49:19] able to go too far. The true anointed
[49:23] one of the end time, our word born, word
[49:28] living bride.
[49:34] Now
[49:36] because remember when he preaches
[49:38] anointed one in the end times he said
[49:40] that the anointing can fall on the just
[49:43] and the unjust but the word seed will
[49:47] bring forth life. Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; The difference was one will produce the
[49:53] very life. The other even though it was
[49:56] anointed, it will come forth. It will
[49:59] produce signs and wonders and all of
[50:01] this. BUT THE THE THE DIFFERENCE WAS by
[50:04] the fruits you shall know them. ONE WAS
[50:07] FOCUSED ON LIFE. THE OTHER WAS produce
[50:09] was focused on sign and wonders. THAT'S
[50:12] WHY MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, AS BELIEVERS
[50:14] OF THIS MESSAGE, WHAT WE DESIRE IS THE
[50:17] VERY LIFE OF Jesus Christ.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Whether you produce a sign or not,
[50:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE DESIRE IS THE LIFE. What we
[50:30] DESIRE IS FOR THE SAME LIFE TO BE
[50:32] MANIFESTED. MANY ANOINTED, BUT THOSE
[50:35] BORN BY THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD WILL
[50:38] carry the true life of Christ. THE
[50:41] EVIDENCE OF THE SPIRIT ISN'T SENSATION
[50:43] BUT STAYING WITH THE word that is given.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; AND NOW DON'T FORGET THE WORD IS NOT
[50:51] WITHOUT A REPROACH.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; I I I didn't read it but if you read in
[50:56] Galatians
[50:58] he says now
[51:01] the it says that it talks about the
[51:03] children of the bond woman and the free.
[51:06] IT SAYS THE BOND WOMAN HAS A LOT OF
[51:08] CHILDREN,
[51:10] BUT THE FREE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ONE.
[51:13] SO YOU LOOK AT A BOND WOMAN IS ABLE TO
[51:16] PROSPER AND DO ALL OF THIS, BUT THE
[51:18] CHILDREN OF THE FREE, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
[51:21] TAKING LONGER. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LOT
[51:23] OF WORK. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT COMING.
[51:26] BUT MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, THAT'S WHY WE
[51:28] DON'T COMPARE OURSELVES WITH ANYBODY
[51:29] ELSE.
[51:32] I I DESIRE I I I I WANT WHAT GOD HAS IN
[51:36] PORTION FOR ME.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT GOD HAS IN STORE FOR ME. I
[51:42] WANT SOMETHING THAT CAN CHANGE MY LIFE.
[51:45] I WANT SOMETHING THAT GOD PROMISED THAT
[51:47] HAS MY NAME ON IT.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF I TRY TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY
[51:54] ELSE, I'LL ONLY END UP WITH IMITATION.
[51:57] I'LL ONLY END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT
[51:59] WILL ONLY SATISFY FOR A LITTLE BIT. BUT
[52:01] WHEN YOU RECEIVE THAT WHICH COMES FROM
[52:03] HIM, YOU ARE SATISFIED FOREVER.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE, LET ME SAY THIS, IS TO BE THE
[52:12] FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. THE
[52:18] BRIDE IS THE VERY MOUTHPIECE OF GOD.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:25] Now that's scary.
[52:28] I I and I I wonder if we and and I'm
[52:33] sure we know all of this thing, but do
[52:34] we let them just wash over us?
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Do we mind ourselves? You know, when
[52:40] when you lose your job, when your child
[52:43] is sick, when things seems like they're
[52:45] not just going right, do you do you
[52:48] actually take a minute to remind
[52:50] yourself of what you are really called
[52:52] to be? or do you panic and call 911 and
[52:56] and move around and lose it?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M SPEAKING THIS SO WE COULD BE
[53:01] REMINDED. IT'S NOT BY OUR STRENGTH, BUT
[53:04] IT'S BY THE WORD. Let me say this. JESUS
[53:07] WAS WHO HE WAS BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; BUT SAYS HE BELIEVED WHAT THE WORD SAID
[53:13] ABOUT HIM.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL READ IT. HOW MANY BELIEVE JESUS
[53:20] WAS PREDESTINATED? AMEN.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; You believe that? BUT SAYS THE SAME AS
[53:24] HE WAS PREDESTINATED, YOU ARE
[53:27] predestinated also.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T ATTACH SOME TYPE OF POWER TO
[53:33] JESUS THAT YOU DON'T GOT.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; THE SAME WORD THAT SPOKE OF THE BRIDE
[53:38] SPEAKS OF THE BRIDEGROOM.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; SCARY. I told you it's going to get
[53:45] scary.
[53:48] BUTAM SAYS IT IT IT WASN'T JESUS DIDN'T
[53:52] RAISE HIMSELF UP. GOD RAISED HIM FROM
[53:55] THE DEAD.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE
[54:00] DEAD. AND IT SAYS THE SAME SPIRIT THAT
[54:03] RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD WHEN HE DWELLS
[54:05] IN YOU IT WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL
[54:07] BODY. SO LET ME SAY THIS THE SAME WHAT
[54:10] WE NEED IS THE SAME ATTITUDE THAT WAS IN
[54:13] JESUS THAT HE LOOKED THE SCRIPTURE SAYS
[54:16] HE TAUGHT IT NOT ROBBERY TO BE EQUAL
[54:18] WITH GOD BUT HE BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT
[54:20] THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM
[54:23] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID IF HE BELIEVE ALL THAT THE
[54:25] WORD SAID ABOUT HIM COULD WE ALSO NOT
[54:28] BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT THE WORD SAID
[54:30] ABOUT us
[54:35] &gt;&gt; we we we
[54:37] have such a habit to make oursel lesser
[54:41] &gt;&gt; you KNOW LIKE WHAT WHATEVER IT IS WE
[54:43] FIND A WAY
[54:45] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT lesser
[54:47] &gt;&gt; to make it less effective less enticing
[54:52] not enticing for no LESS ATTRACTIVE LESS
[54:56] POWERFUL LESS WHATEVER LESS WHATEVER NO
[55:01] IT SAID IT THE SAME WORD THAT SPEAKS OF
[55:04] THE bride speaks of THE BRIDEGROOM IN
[55:07] FACT SAID WHEN HE DIED ON THE CROSS, YOU
[55:09] WERE WITH HIM.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; IT SAID THE REASON WHY YOU WERE WITH HIM
[55:13] AND WHEN HE DIED, YOU WERE INSIDE OF
[55:16] HIM. WHEN HE WAS PUNCTURED, YOU CAME
[55:18] OUT.
[55:28] In this closing this translation, God
[55:30] speaks only through the body. The same
[55:35] life that was in the head. And this is
[55:38] me speaking
[55:40] because remember we live in the union
[55:44] time. We live in the invisible union.
[55:47] Barbanam says the word has come to
[55:50] connect it to the body. So the life that
[55:53] was in the head, that life also is in
[55:56] the body to manifest the same works. THE
[56:00] SAME LIFE, THE same blood that was in
[56:03] the head has moved into the body to make
[56:06] it alive, to make it move. That's why he
[56:09] SAYS SHE DOESN'T SPEAK OUTSIDE OF HIM
[56:12] SPEAKING. IN OTHER WORD, MY BODY TAKES
[56:16] IT TAKES A CUE FROM THE HEAD. WHEN THE
[56:18] HEAD SAYS DOES THIS, IT DOES. WHEN MY
[56:21] THE HEAD SAID DO THIS, IT DOES. WHY? YOU
[56:23] BECOME CONNECTED TO HIM AND YOU TAKE ALL
[56:26] OF YOUR instruction from him.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; The bride becomes the word.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; The voice of the bridegroom is in the
[56:42] bride form. The manifestation of Christ
[56:45] in the end time. He says Christ is in
[56:48] the bride form. It says what was what
[56:51] was once in the head has now come into
[56:55] the body. It's Christ again making
[56:59] himself known into the bride form. Did
[57:03] he say not that the manifestation of in
[57:05] the end time will be in the bride form?
[57:07] He says in the formation of the bride.
[57:11] WHO WAS IT? HE WAS SPEAKING OF YOU.
[57:13] AMEN.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now remember,
[57:19] I don't have the quote here, but he
[57:21] speaks about the son of man. He said
[57:23] that it's when we receive the word of
[57:26] God, when we take the word of God as it
[57:28] is spoken and we believe it, he says
[57:31] that word will manifest
[57:34] the son of man again.
[57:36] Every time,
[57:39] every time you believe and take the word
[57:41] and apply it, it's bound to manifest the
[57:44] son of man. THE MYSTERY OF GOD, CHRIST
[57:47] IN YOU, THE HOPE OF glory is the
[57:49] complete of of is the completeness of
[57:52] himself. The bride and the bridegrooms
[57:54] are one. The same spirit, the same
[57:57] purpose. He says we are called for to
[58:00] separate
[58:01] from all the things of the world.
[58:07] Now if if I I'll say this, you have to
[58:12] desire these things.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; There has to be and I want to say this.
[58:18] We we not just what we claim to be, but
[58:23] our lives is the manifestation of who we
[58:26] are.
[58:27] you you there has to be something in
[58:30] your heart that desire the things that
[58:33] we are speaking about to come to pass
[58:35] into your life.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; THIS CANNOT BE SOME TYPE of intellectual
[58:41] understanding or relationship where we
[58:44] memorize those things and we are fine
[58:46] with them. NO, THE REASON WHY YOUR EYES
[58:49] HAVE BEEN OPEN, LET ME ASK THIS. WHY
[58:51] WOULD GOD OPEN YOUR EYES FOR this age?
[58:56] So you can just say you know God sent a
[58:59] messenger. No.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; NO. IF GOD OPENED YOUR EYES IN THIS AGE
[59:04] IS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE the deception
[59:07] that's happening. IS SO THAT YOU WILL
[59:09] RECEIVE THAT WHICH IS GIVEN FOR THIS
[59:11] AGE. IS SO THAT YOU CAN BECOME AN
[59:14] OVERCOMER IN THIS AGE.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IF WE ARE ONLY SATISFIED WITH
[59:20] THE FACT THAT OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN
[59:23] WITHOUT THE LIFE, HOW WHAT GOOD WOULD
[59:25] THAT BE? OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR A
[59:28] PURPOSE OF GOING IN AND EATING OF THE
[59:30] FRUITS OF THE LAND.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR THE PURPOSE
[59:37] OF PRODUCING THE LIFE.
[59:42] SO THAT THAT'S WHY I SAID WHEN WE FIND
[59:44] THE LACKING, WE WE HAVE TO APPLY THE
[59:47] WORD BECAUSE THE WORD IS THE ONLY THING
[59:50] THAT CORRECTS THE ERROR.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; I IT'S NOT SOMEBODY TELLING YOU YOU GOT
[59:56] TO DRESS LIKE THIS, YOU GOT TO DO THIS.
[59:58] Let me tell you this. If you DO IT
[59:59] BECAUSE BROTHER DAVID said it,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; you're not going to go too far.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; No. If you do it because brother Matthew
[1:00:08] said it, it's not going to be helpful.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; It's good, but it's not going to be
[1:00:12] helpful.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; BUT MY WHEN YOU STRUCK YOU BY
[1:00:15] REVELATION, WHEN SOMETHING INSIDE OF
[1:00:17] YOUR HEART WANTS TO OBEY THE WORD OF
[1:00:19] GOD, MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER, THAT'S
[1:00:21] WHEN IT BECOMES LIFE. THAT'S WHEN THE
[1:00:24] WORD IS MADE FLESH.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; THE WORD MADE FLESH IS GOD MANIFESTED IN
[1:00:30] YOUR HUMAN BEING.
[1:00:37] So we he says THAT EVERY MOVE OF GOD
[1:00:42] produces twins can enable and Esau and
[1:00:45] Jacob and and so forth. We have to
[1:00:49] separate
[1:00:50] from everything that's not the word of
[1:00:52] God
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PART OF SATAN TACTIC is to keep
[1:00:58] us distracted to keep us in a position
[1:01:01] where we fail to come into the fullness.
[1:01:05] Remember the parable of the seed when
[1:01:07] the seed fell FORTH THERE WAS THOSE THAT
[1:01:10] FELL ON THE WAY SIDE AND AND THOSE THAT
[1:01:12] fell on the rock and everything. THE THE
[1:01:14] WHAT WAS LACKING WAS THAT THAT THE SEED
[1:01:17] DIDN'T FALL IN THE GROUND THAT WAS
[1:01:19] FERTILE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW IT UP AND TO
[1:01:21] LET MOISTURE AND EVERYTHING SO IT
[1:01:24] PRODUCED THE FULLNESS OF WHAT HE WAS
[1:01:26] CALLED. SO WHAT ALWAYS CAUSES THE
[1:01:28] PROBLEM IS OUR INABILITY TO STAY WITH
[1:01:32] THE WORD OF GOD TO STAY IN FOCUS AND LET
[1:01:34] HIM MAKE IT HAPPEN for you.
[1:01:38] We'll go here and we'll see and we'll
[1:01:41] get prayed for and we feel like we're
[1:01:43] doing good and and couple of weeks later
[1:01:45] we feel like
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; oh I need it again.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; You you'll go for a year or two and
[1:01:54] you'll you you'll come from A CAMP
[1:01:56] MEETING AND FEELING LIKE THE LORD HAS
[1:01:58] REALLY DONE FOR YOU A LOT AND THEN YOU
[1:02:00] COME AND AFTER A WHILE YOU FEEL LIKE you
[1:02:02] lost it again. So your Christianity
[1:02:06] becomes connected to your feelings.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Your Christianity
[1:02:14] becomes directly connected on how you
[1:02:16] feel that day.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Wouldn't that be
[1:02:23] miserable?
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; It it depends on your mood. You It
[1:02:29] depends on whether you feel accepted or
[1:02:31] not.
[1:02:34] And and let me just tell you this. God
[1:02:36] didn't leave it up to you.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Nope.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; He made a way. And when it all said and
[1:02:44] done, you will get there.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; If he has to drag you, he will drag you.
[1:02:50] If he has to take you and lay you flat,
[1:02:53] he will. WHEN ALL IS SAID and done, it
[1:02:56] will happen exactly as he promised it
[1:02:58] will do.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; God is never going TO FAIL. HIS WORD
[1:03:01] WILL NOT RETURN FOR IT. BUT THE
[1:03:03] SCRIPTURE SAYS WHEN HE'S SPOKEN IT, IT
[1:03:06] WILL NOT RETURN FOR IT UNTIL HE
[1:03:08] FULFILLED THAT WHICH HE HAS spoken it
[1:03:10] for.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Let me just continue for the sake of
[1:03:12] time.
[1:03:14] So we have to recognize the message of
[1:03:18] the time that we are living in.
[1:03:25] IF IF YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE the message of
[1:03:28] your time,
[1:03:30] you'll miss it just like the Pharisees
[1:03:32] did.
[1:03:36] They came in their day and they looked
[1:03:39] at Jesus and
[1:03:42] fulfilling every word. In fact, to him
[1:03:44] looking at them and says, "Search the
[1:03:47] scriptures for it speaks of me."
[1:03:49] It says, "If you can't believe me for my
[1:03:52] words, believe me for my works because
[1:03:55] they're one and the same. They're
[1:03:56] manifesting that I'm speaking to you the
[1:04:00] things which were spoken of me." So in
[1:04:02] every age, God has a message of
[1:04:06] restoration by the word of God. The
[1:04:09] bride is identifi identifies a groom by
[1:04:13] the word revealed through the prophecy.
[1:04:16] In fact, Barbanam said in in one place,
[1:04:19] if I could just skip, it says that only
[1:04:22] the elect will be able to see the word
[1:04:24] made flesh.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Only the elect will be
[1:04:32] able to see the word made flesh. When
[1:04:35] the word becomes flesh, it's only given
[1:04:38] to those elected people to see it.
[1:04:45] So if we take that statement,
[1:04:48] we can agree all of us tonight that just
[1:04:52] the fact that your eyes have been open
[1:04:54] to see it makes you a special person.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; You understand? SO THEN WHY STOP THERE?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; WHY STOP THERE? YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN
[1:05:09] TO SEE IT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CONTINUE?
[1:05:12] HE DIDN'T OPEN IT SO YOU CAN JUST STAY
[1:05:14] THERE AND SAY, "THANK GOD FOR MALACHI
[1:05:16] 4." NO. MALACHI 4 DID HIS JOB AND
[1:05:19] THERE'S A JOB LEFT FOR YOU TO DO.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; MALACHI 4 FULFILL HIS PART AND YOU GOT A
[1:05:25] PART TO FULFILL THE SAME WORD. THE SAME
[1:05:27] WAY WAS MADE MANIFEST IN MALACHI 4. THAT
[1:05:30] SAME WORD IS HERE TO BE MADE MANIFESTED
[1:05:33] IN YOU. AMEN.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Vindicated by the spirit of God and the
[1:05:43] word together. If the same spirit, it's
[1:05:47] the same spirit and it's the it's the
[1:05:50] spirit and the word together that makes
[1:05:53] the manifestation. The true anointed
[1:05:56] aligned perfectly with the word. The
[1:05:59] bride doesn't speak her own ideas.
[1:06:06] You know, let me just read this. I was
[1:06:10] going to say something, but let me just
[1:06:11] read this.
[1:06:16] But when I will say
[1:06:23] in the message, the word becoming flesh
[1:06:26] or the the word become flesh preach in
[1:06:28] India trip. He says now
[1:06:32] he tells us it tells us it says
[1:06:34] paragraph 170 he says that before there
[1:06:38] was a man before there was before in the
[1:06:41] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:06:43] with God and the word was with God and
[1:06:46] the word was made flesh it says now it
[1:06:50] says just about as far as human mind can
[1:06:54] go that's as far as we can go back now
[1:06:57] in the beginning is that Right. It says,
[1:07:00] "In the beginning was the word, but he
[1:07:02] says, but now that's as far as you can
[1:07:05] go by theology." I love that
[1:07:09] the theologian can only come and stop
[1:07:11] right here at the beginning of the book.
[1:07:13] When they read the first text says, "In
[1:07:16] the beginning, God created and the word
[1:07:18] was with God." They stop right there.
[1:07:20] [snorts] They they cannot go past that.
[1:07:23] But listen to what he says. It says that
[1:07:25] it says that's how far we can go by our
[1:07:28] mind. But revelation carries us beyond
[1:07:32] that.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; That's why I SAY IT'S NOT BY YOUR FLESH.
[1:07:38] FORGET YOUR FLESH. I'M NOT HERE
[1:07:41] PREACHING TO YOUR FLESH. YOUR FLESH WILL
[1:07:43] BE BROUGHT UNDER SUBJECTION. THE TROUBLE
[1:07:46] WITH US IS WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT OUR
[1:07:48] FLESH. OH, MY FLESH IS THIS, MY FLESH IS
[1:07:50] THAT. FORGET ABOUT IT. DON'T PAY
[1:07:52] ATTENTION TO IT. FEED THE SOUL. FEED THE
[1:07:55] WORD. AND THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF
[1:07:57] YOUR FLESH.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR FLESH.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD WILL KILL YOUR FLESH.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The trouble is what I spoke about. We we
[1:08:17] we we give so much leniency to our
[1:08:21] flesh, right? We keep it in contact with
[1:08:24] so many things and then we wonder why we
[1:08:27] are troubled.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; WE FEED THE BLACK DOG EVERY MINUTE.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; WE GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE CRIES OUT FOR
[1:08:36] AND we wonder why we have trouble.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; FEED YOUR SOUL AND WATCH WHAT IT WILL
[1:08:46] PRODUCE.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; FEED YOUR SOUL AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT IT
[1:08:50] WILL PRODUCE. YOU EAT THE WORD, THERE'S
[1:08:52] NO WAY YOU WON'T PRODUCE THE WORD.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; YOU STAY WITH THE WORD. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:08:58] THIS. AND THIS IS WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT
[1:09:00] EVEN KNOWING. YOU DON'T YOU KNOW IT. YOU
[1:09:02] GET IN CERTAIN PLACES AND EVERYTHING.
[1:09:05] ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING AND ALARM GOES
[1:09:07] OFF. IT SAYS, "I WON'T BE HERE. I DON'T
[1:09:09] WANT TO BE HERE. I'M GOING OUT OF HERE."
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING INSIDE of you
[1:09:17] THAT WILL TELL YOU THIS IS NOT OKAY.
[1:09:21] AMEN.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; But if you worry about this, oh, I don't
[1:09:25] want Brother Matthew to see me here.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Right. I I don't want anybody from the
[1:09:31] church to see me. That's the wrong
[1:09:34] approach.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That that that's just human flesh,
[1:09:38] right? So then how about God? Do you
[1:09:40] care about him seeing you? Do you care
[1:09:42] about him looking at your heart?
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT
[1:09:49] PEOPLE CAN SEE. IT'S A IS A SACREDNESS
[1:09:52] INSIDE OF THE HEART. SOMETHING THAT
[1:09:54] WANTS TO LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT WANTS TO OBEY THE WORD OF
[1:09:59] GOD. SOMETHING THAT BEATS THE WORD OF
[1:10:02] GOD INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. THAT'S WHAT
[1:10:04] WILL PRODUCE THE RESULT.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; So he says now he says I'll just teach
[1:10:11] something on the theology. You think in
[1:10:13] the beginning was the word and the words
[1:10:15] was and the word was uh and that word
[1:10:18] was God and the word was God. That's
[1:10:20] right. At the same was made flesh and
[1:10:22] dwelt among us and then God was made
[1:10:25] flesh without controversy. That's true.
[1:10:28] God was made flesh. We believe that. But
[1:10:31] now THERE WAS THAT WORD. IT SAYS WHAT IS
[1:10:33] A WORD? A word is the manifestation of a
[1:10:37] thought. It says is expression OF A
[1:10:40] THOUGHT. HE SAID, "IS THAT RIGHT? BEFORE
[1:10:42] YOU SAY anything subconsciously, you
[1:10:45] think of it before YOU SPEAK IT." IS
[1:10:48] THAT RIGHT? HE SAYS, HE continues on. He
[1:10:50] says, "UH, NOW, SO IN THE BEGINNING was
[1:10:54] the word." IT SAYS THAT'S AS FAR AS WE
[1:10:57] CAN GO BACK BY THIS. We're speaking of
[1:10:59] book BY THEOLOGY. BUT BEFORE THE WORD
[1:11:03] WAS BEFORE THAT WORD WAS, it was A
[1:11:06] THOUGHT. AND THE THOUGHT WAS MADE
[1:11:09] MANIFEST. You see what I mean?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, YOU COME DIRECTLY
[1:11:18] FROM THE THOUGHTS OF GOD.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; HE HE'S WANTING YOU TO KNOW YOU. THAT'S
[1:11:22] WHY WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, WE HAVE TO
[1:11:25] GO PAST OUR MIND, OUR THINKING, OUR
[1:11:28] REALIZATION, OUR EVERYTHING. WE HAVE TO
[1:11:31] BE LIFTED UP IN HEAVENLY PLACES TO
[1:11:34] UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH HE'S SPEAKING
[1:11:36] ABOUT.
[1:11:43] YOU YOU THAT'S WHY THE MIND OF CHRIST
[1:11:47] HAS TO BE IN YOU.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; WE WE CANNOT APPROACH THE WORD OF GOD
[1:11:51] AND SUBJECT IT TO OUR HUMAN MIND AND
[1:11:54] REASONING. WE WILL COME OUT LIKE
[1:11:56] NICODEMUS.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; You shall be born again. H how shall
[1:12:02] this be? How h how can a grown-up like
[1:12:05] me return back into my mother's womb and
[1:12:09] be born again?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; And we say that's Nicodemus. We do it
[1:12:16] all the time.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; WE DO IT EVERY DAY. THE WORD SAID BE
[1:12:22] PERFECT. HOW AM I GOING TO BE PERFECT?
[1:12:24] He who said be perfect has made a way
[1:12:27] for you to be perfect.
[1:12:29] ALL WE NEED TO SAY IS, "FATHER, YOU CALL
[1:12:31] ME TO BE PERFECT. PROVIDE WHAT I NEED TO
[1:12:34] BE PERFECT. I'M HERE AS YOUR HANDMADE.
[1:12:37] LET IT BE UNTO ME ACCORDING [screaming]
[1:12:39] TO THY WORD. YOU CALL PERFECTION. I
[1:12:42] BELIEVE PERFECTION."
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Do not make an excuse.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, your flesh becomes an excuse
[1:12:51] on why you cannot attain.
[1:12:56] I I don't have that quote, but I love it
[1:12:58] so much. But Ram says, "No matter how
[1:13:01] weak you are, how strong you are, how
[1:13:04] unable you are," he basically just lists
[1:13:07] it all,
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Let me even go as further said, "Your
[1:13:14] desire to become the word was placed in
[1:13:17] your heart by himself. He places the
[1:13:20] desire so he can come and fulfill it.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; So
[1:13:29] he says here in the message I have heard
[1:13:32] but now I see. He says now I I love
[1:13:35] this. He he's speaking about the woman
[1:13:39] that came to wash his feet.
[1:13:41] Uh the and I want you to just hear says
[1:13:45] paragraph 174. says her eyes had seen
[1:13:50] beyond his criticism.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; If you could put it up there. A and I
[1:13:57] want to use that to say that the the
[1:14:00] true word has never been without
[1:14:02] criticism.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; It's okay to be criticized.
[1:14:11] I'm telling you,
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; it's okay to be mocked at
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; because he was mocked, too.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; It's okay when people look at you and
[1:14:20] think you're crazy.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; We the the we we want to be liked by
[1:14:28] everybody.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; It's never going to happen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; What we want is to be liked by him.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; You with me? What you want is to BE THE
[1:14:38] IMAGE OF WHAT HE DESIRE. Whatever he's
[1:14:41] pleased with, that's good enough with
[1:14:43] me.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; SO SHE LOOKED, SHE HER eyes had seen
[1:14:49] beyond the his criticism. He says she
[1:14:52] believed he was see the word of the
[1:14:58] prophets.
[1:14:59] And now I want you now to think about
[1:15:03] this woman, to think about yourself, and
[1:15:05] to think about the message of the hour
[1:15:07] and what it came to produce. So it says
[1:15:11] she knowed
[1:15:13] that that WAS ALL THE WORD of the
[1:15:16] prophets was vindicated in him.
[1:15:20] She had heard he was on earth, but now
[1:15:25] she sees him.
[1:15:28] Watch what she done. She seen the word
[1:15:32] made flesh, THE MESSIAH, the Emmanuel,
[1:15:37] when she gave vent to HER PULSATION OF
[1:15:41] faith of REVELATION OF HE WAS of who HE
[1:15:46] WAS IN THAT TIME SHE WAS LIVING IN THAT
[1:15:50] HE WAS GOD'S LAMB FOR such sinner. And
[1:15:55] she was as she was, she went forth to
[1:15:59] serve him, to serve his needs without
[1:16:02] knowing how she would do it.
[1:16:09] Let me tell you, that's the formula to
[1:16:13] obtain whatever you have need of. My
[1:16:16] eyes have been open to see that this
[1:16:18] message is a reality. I have seen the
[1:16:21] word made flesh in my generation. I
[1:16:24] DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT, but
[1:16:27] I am going to serve his needs.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; I AM GOING TO LAY MYSELF DOWN SO THAT I
[1:16:35] CAN BE USED BY HIM. I DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:16:38] HE'S GOING TO CHOOSE TO DO IT. I DON'T
[1:16:40] KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO DO IT IN THE
[1:16:41] MORNING OR NIGHT, BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS
[1:16:43] MESSAGE. I HAVE SEEN HIM OPEN MY EYES.
[1:16:46] [screaming] I HAVE COME TO THE
[1:16:47] UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS THE MESSAGE
[1:16:49] OF MALACHI 4. THEREFORE, I COMMIT MYSELF
[1:16:53] TO HIM
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; that he will take care of my life.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; BUT SAYS THUS THE WAY A GENUINE healing
[1:17:02] comes. He says when it's revealed that
[1:17:06] you HE WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR
[1:17:08] TRANSGRESSION, bruised for your
[1:17:10] iniquity, with his STRIPES YOU WERE
[1:17:12] HEALED. WHEN IT'S INSPIRED TO YOU TO SEE
[1:17:16] HIS PRESENCE HERE, ST. MARK 11, IT says
[1:17:19] or or Luke 17 UH 30 THAT HE WAS GOING TO
[1:17:23] REVEAL HIMSELF IN THE LAST DAY AMONG HIS
[1:17:27] PEOPLE IS HUMAN FLESH LIKE HE DID BEFORE
[1:17:30] SODOM. WHEN YOU SEE that
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; and something strikes you,
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; the doctor says it's cancer still the
[1:17:42] the cancer is still here.
[1:17:45] That patient, it says that patient might
[1:17:48] say, "I I don't know how I'm going to
[1:17:51] walk, but I'm going to walk anyhow." We
[1:17:55] don't know how he's going to do it.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; What does it is I realize it's him and
[1:18:02] how it's going to happen, it's none of
[1:18:04] my business.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; What matters is my eyes have been open
[1:18:11] to see Luke 17:30. And because I have
[1:18:15] seen it, everything else is left in his
[1:18:17] hands.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; He speaks in the message, the spoken
[1:18:20] word is the original seed.
[1:18:24] Paragraph 224, he says, pred
[1:18:28] predestinated as he was,
[1:18:33] predestinated.
[1:18:35] Paragraph 224, [snorts] predestinated as
[1:18:38] he was, makes the word seed flesh in
[1:18:42] you.
[1:18:45] his church, God's word.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You say, "Sure, brother Bam. Every word
[1:18:52] I believe,
[1:18:54] then don't back up."
[1:18:56] It says, "Don't back up when your
[1:18:59] tradition when you get
[1:19:01] Don't back up when you get your
[1:19:03] tradition.
[1:19:04] Stay right with that word. Stay with
[1:19:08] that. Watch what happens.
[1:19:17] Watch what happens.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; And and and I want to say this, part of
[1:19:20] our challenge is we we want
[1:19:24] a a a quick Christianity, right? Like
[1:19:26] one that just happens overnight. Like
[1:19:29] today I'm a sinner and tomorrow I'm the
[1:19:31] manifested son, right? You know what I
[1:19:34] mean? Like today I'm a sinner and
[1:19:36] tomorrow I'm lifting I'm I'm raising the
[1:19:39] dead and fixing everything.
[1:19:43] It's a teaching.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; It takes the tutor. It takes the tutor
[1:19:48] to continually walk with you and show
[1:19:51] you. There's so many things that you
[1:19:53] learn along the way. There's so many he
[1:19:56] he will give you as much as he desire to
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; and it's not to be compared one with
[1:20:01] another. But says the new birth is the
[1:20:04] beginning.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the very foundation on
[1:20:09] which which he wants you to stand.
[1:20:12] I It's him continually manifesting and
[1:20:16] working his life in you so you can
[1:20:19] produce what he desires. So it says and
[1:20:22] watch what IT SAYS. OH LORD, I believe
[1:20:24] this. Send your Holy Spirit. Watch this.
[1:20:26] IT SAYS, "THEN WATCH if
[1:20:30] then watch if he goes to bear record,
[1:20:33] then you know you got it." It says, it
[1:20:37] says not by some sensation, the devil do
[1:20:40] that. Not by some miracles, the devil do
[1:20:44] that. But by your constant belief in the
[1:20:48] word of God and the life that you live,
[1:20:53] never never denying nothing. All right?
[1:20:57] That makes the word becoming flesh. See,
[1:21:00] flesh and the same water spirit.
[1:21:08] What about my sister? It's the word that
[1:21:12] produces the result.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; And I love what he said. When you
[1:21:17] believe the word, the spirit of God is
[1:21:20] bound to come and make that word a
[1:21:23] reality to you.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Our trouble is we fail to associate the
[1:21:31] word and the spirit. The word, the
[1:21:35] spirit is what makes the word alive. But
[1:21:38] when says it in I believe rising of the
[1:21:40] sun or the the the other message it says
[1:21:43] it says it takes the word he quickens
[1:21:46] it. We we we hold on to THE WORD AND GOD
[1:21:49] QUICKENS THE word so we can know that
[1:21:53] his word is a reality.
[1:21:56] if the musician could come.
[1:22:00] He said
[1:22:05] in the message
[1:22:07] here,
[1:22:10] it says,
[1:22:12] "And when the word of God is put into a
[1:22:16] fertile ground of his inspired believer,
[1:22:20] he produces just exactly what God said
[1:22:24] he would do."
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:26] because it can't fail.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; It's God's eternal word.
[1:22:34] God, it says it's got to waken the
[1:22:37] people. God to bring us to something
[1:22:41] when the word is received. And it says
[1:22:45] when that's in what's then what that's
[1:22:48] what's in the inspiration. It says, "And
[1:22:51] man into a con in no condition outside
[1:22:54] of repentance." It says that he it says
[1:22:57] he's no condition to receive the word
[1:23:00] until first he has been inspired.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you are you
[1:23:10] inspired tonight?
[1:23:12] I is there an identification in your
[1:23:14] heart tonight? Is there something?
[1:23:17] Because the word that was made flesh in
[1:23:20] Jesus, we have a promise that that word
[1:23:22] has to be made flesh in us again. He
[1:23:25] promised that the fullness of who he is
[1:23:28] by the invisible union will be made
[1:23:30] flesh unto us. He promised that in the
[1:23:33] end time as we just read but when I'm
[1:23:36] speaking and they said that that word
[1:23:37] must come into manifestation again if I
[1:23:40] could just read it in closing
[1:23:43] he says in the message the seed is not
[1:23:45] heir with the shot paragraph 100 it says
[1:23:48] but when the seed was delivered he said
[1:23:51] I come to do the will of of him that
[1:23:54] sent me I and my father are one I do
[1:23:58] nothing I do not his I says I do not his
[1:24:01] works. Believe me, if I do not his work,
[1:24:04] believe me not. It says there was the
[1:24:07] seed which was one
[1:24:10] which was one of you can who can condemn
[1:24:13] me of unbelief. But what the Bible has
[1:24:17] promised I will do. I CAN DO IT. GOD HAS
[1:24:21] VERIFIED THAT through me. He says he
[1:24:24] said he can tell me now. He said, "But
[1:24:30] the seed in Mary, the shock, it was
[1:24:33] close to being that, but it wasn't.
[1:24:37] It was still in the womb." Excuse me.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Notice now, notice. And in the
[1:24:55] Pentecostal age, through the Lutheran
[1:24:57] age and through the wrestling's age, and
[1:24:59] it it's been the same thing through the
[1:25:02] Pentecostal age, it says, "Now notice,
[1:25:05] but in at the opening of the seal, seven
[1:25:09] seals, Revelation 10, the full word is
[1:25:12] to be born into manifestation again and
[1:25:16] vindicated by the spirit of God in the
[1:25:19] full strength as it was when he was here
[1:25:23] on earth manifesting the manifested in
[1:25:26] the same way doing the same thing that
[1:25:29] he did when he was here on earth. Amen.
[1:25:33] Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same
[1:25:36] yesterday today and forever. In St. Luke
[1:25:38] 17 and30 JESUS SAID IN THAT IN THE LAST
[1:25:42] DAY THAT AS I AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF
[1:25:46] SODOM WHEN THE SON OF MAN WILL BE
[1:25:48] REVEALED HIMSELF AGAIN IT will be the
[1:25:52] same thing. [snorts]
[1:25:56] What is it? It's the full word of God
[1:25:59] coming into manifestation. NOW THE FULL
[1:26:01] WORD CAN COME CANNOT COME INTO
[1:26:03] manifestation with a bunch of likings
[1:26:06] WITH A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS WITH A BUNCH
[1:26:09] OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THIS THE
[1:26:11] WORD OR NO THE FULL WORD COMES IN
[1:26:13] MANIFESTATION WITH THE SAME LIFE THAT
[1:26:16] WAS IN CHRIST MANIFESTED IN THE people
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; my brother and my sister we are not
[1:26:24] forsaken
[1:26:26] we are called into the fold what we need
[1:26:29] is to be strengthened by the word of God
[1:26:32] to understand that what we have received
[1:26:35] it's not the words of man it's the words
[1:26:37] of GOD THIS IS GOD'S PROMISE for you in
[1:26:40] the end time that HE WOULD MANIFEST
[1:26:43] HIMSELF IN THE FULLNESS OF WHO HE was
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; in his church that the church will be
[1:26:50] his name that the church will bear his
[1:26:53] name will will carry his name that the
[1:26:55] church WILL DO THE SAME WORKS THAT HE
[1:26:57] DID WHY WOULD THAT BE BECAUSE IT'S THE
[1:27:00] SAME GOD MANIFESTING HIMSELF AGAIN.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; But if we think, "Oh, I can't do it."
[1:27:09] And and I'm lacking here and I'm lacking
[1:27:12] there and and my question is, what are
[1:27:15] you looking at?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Are you looking at the one who spoke it?
[1:27:18] Or are you looking at your flesh? Are
[1:27:20] you looking at your own effort? Are you
[1:27:22] looking at the one that spoke it? HE
[1:27:24] THAT SPAKETH, THE SAME SPIRIT THAT
[1:27:27] RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD, IF HE
[1:27:29] DWELLS IN YOU, HE'LL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR
[1:27:31] MORTAL BODY.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO QUICKEN THE WORD IN YOU.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROCESS OF QUICKENING IT TAKES
[1:27:40] FOR YOU TO EAT THE WORD AND STAY IN THE
[1:27:42] PRESENCE OF THE SON IN ORDER FOR YOU TO
[1:27:45] MANIFEST IT.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:52] Let's not fail short of what we've been
[1:27:55] called to. Let let's not come to a place
[1:27:58] where we let the cares of life overtake
[1:28:01] us, but let's WALK WITH OUR HEAD HELD
[1:28:04] HIGH. LET'S KNOW THERE'S A PROMISE IN
[1:28:06] STORE FOR US. AND BROTHER SAYS IT'S THE
[1:28:09] INFALLIBLE WORD OF HIS PROMISE. WHEN GOD
[1:28:12] MAKES A PROMISE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT
[1:28:15] PROMISE CAN FAIL. IF JESUS CAME AND
[1:28:18] MANIFESTED HIMSELF AND HE WAS THE WORD
[1:28:20] MADE FLESH, YOU WILL BECOME THE WORD
[1:28:22] MADE FLESH TODAY. YOU WILL DO THE SAME
[1:28:25] THING THAT HE DID. JUST LIKE JESUS NEVER
[1:28:28] FAILED. YOU CANNOT FAIL.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, it will be a contradiction.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; But now it's not done in boastful.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; It's done in the life of Christ living
[1:28:42] inside of people.
[1:28:44] Let me ask you this and this is part of
[1:28:48] the some of the things it's important
[1:28:49] that we know whenever you think about
[1:28:53] the life of Christ you need to ask
[1:28:56] yourself a question when th life was in
[1:29:00] Christ what did he do
[1:29:05] what did thy life produce
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; because those are the things that you
[1:29:11] need to measure All you looked in you to
[1:29:15] be manifested. The scripture says the
[1:29:18] life that was in him he lived not for
[1:29:21] himself he lived for others.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; The the life that was in him, he did
[1:29:33] nothing except what the father showed
[1:29:36] him. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM, he took
[1:29:40] it and he laid it down. so others could
[1:29:43] see and come. My question to you, are
[1:29:46] you LAYING YOUR LIFE DOWN SO OTHERS can
[1:29:48] also come?
[1:29:52] Or are we looking for a life where we
[1:29:55] never make a mistake and we are so
[1:29:57] perfect and everybody is below us?
[1:30:00] That's not the kind of LIFE HE THE LIFE
[1:30:02] THAT WAS IN HIM, THEY CALL HIM a friend
[1:30:05] of sinners.
[1:30:08] You with me? THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM.
[1:30:11] HE WENT and he found the MAN ON THE TREE
[1:30:14] AND CALLED UH ZAKIUS AND SAID, "ZAKIUS,
[1:30:18] COME DOWN. TODAY I'M GOING TO EAT AT
[1:30:20] YOUR HOUSE."
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM WAS LOOKING FOR
[1:30:27] THE LOST SEED OF ABRAHAM SO HE CAN BRING
[1:30:30] THEM BACK IN. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM
[1:30:33] WAS NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT
[1:30:36] WHAT THE FATHER WANTED. THE LIFE THAT
[1:30:38] WAS IN HIM KNEW THAT THE FATHER WILL
[1:30:41] TAKE CARE OF HIM NO MATTER WHAT.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; My question to you is, are you doing the
[1:30:49] same works?
[1:30:54] What is the works of Christ to you?
[1:30:58] Is it to to raise the dead and do great
[1:31:00] miracles?
[1:31:04] It's to do that which pleases the
[1:31:07] father.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; It's the life that's given so we can lay
[1:31:11] it down for others. It's the life that's
[1:31:14] given so we can become partakers of
[1:31:18] divine nature and we can become part of
[1:31:21] the redemption process [music] for
[1:31:24] others
[1:31:26] that others may look and see Christ
[1:31:29] living in us. Let's all stand.
[1:31:37] I'll tell you this.
[1:31:40] If I never have to to do one miracles,
[1:31:43] I'm fine with it.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; But as long as I can lay my life down
[1:31:47] and manifest the same life of Christ and
[1:31:51] AND AND HELP OTHERS THAT THEY MAY SEE
[1:31:54] THE same life.
[1:31:57] Healing is part of the atonement. You
[1:31:59] can never take away from it. DELIVERANCE
[1:32:02] AND SALVATION ARE ALL GIVEN. BUT WHAT WE
[1:32:06] DESIRE ABOVE ALL IS THE life to be
[1:32:09] manifested.
[1:32:11] WHEN WE HAVE THE LIFE, WE HAVE ALL
[1:32:13] things because we won't have to worry
[1:32:16] about what's happening to us. The reason
[1:32:18] why we get scared AND THINGS GO ASIDE
[1:32:21] AND WE FEEL LIKE OH we are left out is
[1:32:23] because we need another measure of life.
[1:32:27] Father, that I want to be in your care
[1:32:29] and know that you've taken care of me no
[1:32:31] matter what happens, which is the life
[1:32:34] that was in him. Let's just bow our
[1:32:36] heads.
[1:32:38] Gracious Father, we're so thankful,
[1:32:40] Lord, and
[1:32:45] Lord, desiring that your word be that
[1:32:47] flesh in us.
[1:32:52] Father, even when we say it, we we
[1:32:54] wonder what is our very definition of
[1:32:56] that.
[1:33:01] But Lord, your prophet speaks in perfect
[1:33:03] faith. It says it's to believe
[1:33:05] everything that the word said [music]
[1:33:06] about us.
[1:33:10] That the harmony that was between
[1:33:14] the father and the son, that same
[1:33:16] harmony may exist between Christ and his
[1:33:18] bride.
[1:33:21] Father, it's always been about the
[1:33:24] restoration of what was in the
[1:33:26] beginning.
[1:33:29] Father, the power to stand against evil.
[1:33:32] And
[1:33:34] you would even say that the preaching of
[1:33:36] the word is the casting out of demons.
[1:33:38] And
[1:33:40] Lord, that would take what belongs to
[1:33:41] us. And
[1:33:44] but Father, above all, that we will
[1:33:46] manifest the very nature of who you
[1:33:48] were.
[1:33:51] Father, we hunger for that.
[1:33:54] We hunger that the realities of Jesus
[1:33:57] Christ may not remain in the book
[1:34:00] tonight and in the message and but it
[1:34:04] may actually become part of us
[1:34:08] Lord that we may be like those
[1:34:11] in the revival and when people will will
[1:34:15] come to the Welsh revival and ask and
[1:34:18] said I want to go to the revival and I
[1:34:21] want to see where it was and one will
[1:34:23] stand and say that I am that revival.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Father, it wasn't a
[1:34:31] a group effort or a bunch of people just
[1:34:34] running around, but it was life that
[1:34:37] were made and changed by the word of God
[1:34:42] that father whether they were alone or
[1:34:44] whether they were together, it didn't
[1:34:46] have any change.
[1:34:50] But Lord, it was individuals that could
[1:34:52] go onto the world and preach the gospel
[1:34:55] and and Father, that they would manifest
[1:34:58] the life of Christ to a dying
[1:35:00] generation.
[1:35:02] Lord, that's what we desire. And we know
[1:35:05] for certain that we cannot do it by our
[1:35:08] own self. We ask father that you endure
[1:35:11] us with the power from on high that the
[1:35:14] Holy Spirit may come and in each
[1:35:17] individual here gather here tonight that
[1:35:19] you would quicken the word that you have
[1:35:21] placed in us. Father that that
[1:35:23] quickening power may give us what we
[1:35:26] have need of in order for us to overcome
[1:35:28] the challenges of life. Father that it
[1:35:31] will give us the power to speak and not
[1:35:35] go back. that he WILL GIVE US WHAT WE
[1:35:38] HAVE need of in order for us to press
[1:35:40] forward. Lord, we love you and commit
[1:35:42] everything we are. And we ask all of
[1:35:45] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:35:46] Christ. We pray. Amen. Let's just sing
[1:35:50] now.
[1:35:53] Oh, and
[1:35:57] oh you may take. [music]
[1:36:01] Oh, and one last song
[1:36:05] and one [music] God.
[1:36:08] Oh, and speak the word of God. [music]
[1:36:13] Oh, and my
[1:36:15] see
[1:36:17] what [singing] you believe. [music]
[1:36:20] Always watch what will be.
[1:36:25] Oh, and send [music and singing] your
[1:36:27] wings
[1:36:29] to the wings.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, and [singing and music] you can fly.

[1:36:50] [music]
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Watch your knees. [music]
[1:36:57] [singing]
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] Oh, [music] watch your cry.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, watch your mountain.
[1:37:06] [music and singing]

[1:37:12] the word.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[1:37:16] Oh [singing]
[1:37:17] my.
[1:37:20] [music]
[1:37:21] Oh,
[1:37:24] hallelujah.
[1:37:25] [music]
[1:37:28] Oh, I [singing] set
[1:37:33] to the ring [music] of

[1:37:53] Set your peace [music]
[1:37:56] to the [singing] wings of faith. Watch
[1:38:00] the

[1:38:06] sky. [singing]

[1:38:12] [music] He does not struggle.
[1:38:16] And [singing] for the power
[1:38:20] that [music] makes it round [singing]
[1:38:25] is all
[1:38:28] in [music and singing]
[1:38:29] the sky.
[1:38:32] Oh,
[1:38:34] [music]
[1:38:36] to win the f
[1:38:41] you can find [music]
[1:38:44] it in high
[1:38:46] [music]
[1:38:48] during [singing]
[1:38:53] [music]
[1:39:00] to the [music and singing] waves of
[1:39:01] faith.
[1:39:04] There is a source [music]
[1:39:08] in times [singing]
[1:39:09] of need
[1:39:12] that brings me [music] hope
[1:39:16] that brings me peace.
[1:39:20] In every [music and singing]
[1:39:21] trial,
[1:39:24] through every test,
[1:39:28] my [music and singing] savior stands.
[1:39:32] in my defense [music]
[1:39:35] to end [singing] the road you are.
[1:39:40] Leave your tires
[1:39:42] [music]
[1:39:45] [singing]
[1:39:48] and your [music] heart soul.
[1:39:52] Remember [singing] God
[1:39:55] is gater than [music]
[1:39:57] the sword.
[1:40:00] Take [singing] the reach for [music]
[1:40:03] the battle.
[1:40:08] And when the waters [music and singing]
[1:40:09] cry,
[1:40:12] he calls my name
[1:40:16] and he bends me.
[1:40:20] I'm on [music and singing]
[1:40:21] the way
[1:40:24] and leave my hand
[1:40:28] as [music] I should
[1:40:32] and [singing] makes me stand
[1:40:36] out on the water.
[1:40:39] So when the [music and singing] road you
[1:40:41] walk
[1:40:44] you tight and warm [music]
[1:40:48] and all [singing] the strength is young
[1:40:52] and your heart [music] feels [singing]
[1:40:54] full.

[1:41:12] And when the [music] waters [singing]
[1:41:13] rise,
[1:41:16] he calls my name.
[1:41:19] Oh, and he raised me [music and singing]
[1:41:22] down.
[1:41:23] Oh, out on the way. [music]
[1:41:28] He holds my hand. [singing]

[1:42:00] Remember God
[1:42:03] is ger than the stor. [music]
[1:42:08] and [singing] courage for
[1:42:11] the battle [music] is alone.
[1:42:15] So when the road you [singing and music]
[1:42:17] walk
[1:42:19] leaves you tight and warm,
[1:42:23] your strength is [music] gone
[1:42:27] and your [singing] heart feels full.
[1:42:31] Remember [music] God

[1:43:22] [music]
[1:43:23] king
[1:43:25] and [singing] made
[1:43:27] me [music] home.
[1:43:32] And I will shout [singing and music]
[1:43:35] my hand.
[1:43:43] Oh
[1:43:46] my [music] gosh.
[1:43:53] [music]
[1:43:54] Oh,

[1:44:44] and [singing] now
[1:44:46] I know [music]
[1:44:49] he [singing] touched me
[1:44:52] and made [music]
[1:44:54] me whole.
[1:44:59] [music]
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; And since

[1:45:10] oh

[1:45:13] [singing]
[1:45:18] [music]
[1:45:20] Oh,

[1:45:31] Oh, I [singing] shall

[1:46:26] and since
[1:46:29] I met this man, [music]
[1:46:32] Savior [singing]
[1:46:37] and he [music and singing] sold.

[1:46:46] Oh,

[1:47:08] Oh,

[1:50:51] Oh, the God
[1:50:54] who called me here
