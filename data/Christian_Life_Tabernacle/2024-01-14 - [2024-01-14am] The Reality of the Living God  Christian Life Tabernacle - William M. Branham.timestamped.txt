[16:38] Brother Gary she says my dad Brother
[16:40] Gary stanky was struggling with his

[16:49] years he's been getting scans every
[16:51] three months to watch the spots they
[16:54] made it hard for him to breathe deep and

[17:13] come back in six months all right God is
[17:16] so faithful why don't you just praise
[17:18] the Lord for
[17:23] that I love it when the outcome would be

[17:34] prayer request instead of a praise

[21:53] amen by comparison we have a family
[21:55] member in Canada and it was minus 31
[21:57] there yesterday yesterday so it could be
[22:01] worse you know this week you know we've
[22:05] been making all of our beginning of the
[22:07] year' been having all those beginning of
[22:10] the year kickoff meetings at work if you
[22:12] have ever worked in Corporate America
[22:14] you know exactly what I'm talking about
[22:16] it's a something companies do all over
[22:19] the world the calendar page turns and
[22:22] all of a sudden All Things become new
[22:24] you know there's new programs and new
[22:26] initiatives and new goals and
[22:28] you know knew
[22:31] everything nothing changed except the
[22:34] date and you know I always ask you know
[22:37] if there was a better way of doing
[22:39] things if we should have been doing
[22:40] something different why did we wait why
[22:42] not do it October why wait till January
[22:45] 1 you know one of the new things we
[22:47] launched this year was uh an effort to
[22:52] build a new culture at the
[22:55] company and as part of this they've
[22:57] launched a a
[22:59] program to teach thousands of people how
[23:02] to be
[23:03] different how to
[23:06] change you know how to behave
[23:08] differently how to interact differently
[23:09] how to respond to pressure differently
[23:11] how
[23:13] to do everything differently think
[23:16] differently and uh so we're running
[23:18] thousands of people through this
[23:21] program because we want them to be
[23:24] different we want a different
[23:26] atmosphere and we want on a different
[23:30] culture it's a 12-week program training
[23:34] and workshops all this type of
[23:37] thing to transform people into something
[23:43] new you know to somehow make old people
[23:46] new that they've been behaving one way
[23:49] all their lives and suddenly in 12 weeks
[23:51] of training we're going to teach them
[23:53] how to be different kind of
[23:56] people you know yet with this huge
[23:59] program and it is
[24:00] exhausting not one
[24:03] mention not one
[24:05] consideration for the transforming
[24:10] one you know the one who truly can make
[24:13] all things
[24:16] new you know if you want a different
[24:20] culture you get someone in front of the
[24:22] pillar of fire one
[24:24] time and one night with the King can do
[24:28] what 12 weeks of PR training and
[24:30] programming
[24:33] cannot be ye therefore
[24:36] transformed by the renewing of your
[24:39] mind that you may prove what is that
[24:41] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[24:45] God but no we have a program for doing
[24:49] it we know what it takes to get this
[24:52] done so we're going to run everybody
[24:55] through our program without even
[24:59] considering the presence of the
[25:01] Lord and I thought about that as I was
[25:04] reading Psalm 14 this week we're going
[25:06] to read that
[25:08] today David said in verse two the Lord
[25:11] looked down from heaven upon the
[25:13] children of men to see if there were any
[25:17] that did understand and seek
[25:21] God they are all gone
[25:23] aside they are all together become
[25:26] filthy there is no n that doeth good no
[25:30] not
[25:32] one not a single
[25:34] desire or
[25:37] acknowledgement or attempt to seek the
[25:39] face of the transforming
[25:44] one because they've got a program they'
[25:47] got a method they they've got this all
[25:49] they got a thing they do to do this
[25:54] thing you know the people of this world
[25:56] certainly we should not be surprised
[25:59] when they do this because until you've
[26:01] known
[26:02] him you know there isn't even a desire
[26:06] or an appetite to seek
[26:08] him but I was thinking as I read that
[26:11] you
[26:12] know how often do I get so caught
[26:16] up in my
[26:18] thing you know my ways how I get things
[26:22] done my the way I work the way I do
[26:26] things my methods my preferences my
[26:33] habits that I
[26:35] fail to recognize his
[26:38] presence you know and I'm not talking
[26:40] about getting caught up necessarily in
[26:43] sinful things and I'm not talking about
[26:45] the presence of the Lord in the service
[26:47] church service I'm talking about the
[26:48] presence of the Lord in our individual
[26:52] daily
[26:55] lives because I'm so set on my ways
[26:58] I have a way for doing things I have a
[27:01] habit that I you do with my day there's
[27:04] a certain method to the way that I work
[27:07] that I fail to even consider his
[27:11] presence you know brother brandham spoke
[27:13] of this in a message called the presence
[27:16] of God
[27:18] unrecognized where he spoke of being in
[27:20] such a
[27:21] condition it's your ways Traditions your
[27:26] habits God can be
[27:29] near and we won't acknowledge his
[27:33] presence because it doesn't line up with
[27:36] how we
[27:39] work even a message
[27:42] believer and brother brandham said this
[27:44] now when he is not
[27:47] recognized his power is always not
[27:50] revealed when he is not
[27:52] recognized no matter how much God Is
[27:55] Standing present you've got to believe
[27:59] it that's
[28:02] all we miss
[28:04] out how many times do we miss out every
[28:07] day on the option of leveraging
[28:10] him because we don't consider his
[28:12] presence when we're going through our
[28:15] daily
[28:16] thing what if he wanted us to do
[28:19] something just a little bit
[28:22] different David goes on in verse
[28:25] four have all the workers of iniquity no
[28:28] knowledge who eat up my people as they
[28:31] eat bread and call not upon the Lord you
[28:34] know I thought as I was reading that you
[28:35] know iniquity is doing our own thing
[28:38] it's when we know what to do but we
[28:41] prefer to do something different because
[28:44] it's easier it's comfortable or whatever
[28:46] the case may be
[28:47] and you know my prayer is Lord don't let
[28:50] me be like
[28:51] that you know help me to be sensitive to
[28:55] his presence in my daily life and pause
[28:59] just
[29:00] enough pause just enough to recognize
[29:03] his presence rather than go about it the
[29:07] way that I usually
[29:09] do you know but something else caught my
[29:12] attention as I was reading this they he
[29:14] made that statement eating up my
[29:17] people as they eat bread you know this
[29:21] can happen to
[29:23] us as even as his people if we're not
[29:25] careful that we get so
[29:28] consumed so occupied with the drum beat
[29:32] of life and with how we work and with
[29:36] how we respond and with our habits and
[29:38] our preferences
[29:39] that you know we can often get caught
[29:43] not recognizing his presence until we
[29:45] come back to
[29:47] church you know and I'm not talking
[29:49] about getting caught up in sinful things
[29:51] I'm talking about being so utterly
[29:53] consumed so busy so occupied that the
[29:57] only time we recognize his presence is
[30:01] when we walk through that
[30:02] door we should bring his presence with
[30:05] us not come here to be reminded of
[30:10] it you know I was reminded of the
[30:12] children of Israel who when they first
[30:14] came to Egypt and Joseph was presenting
[30:17] them to
[30:18] Pharaoh he dealt with how they
[30:20] communicated their occupation he said
[30:23] when you talk to Pharaoh tell them what
[30:25] your occupation is it's to to be a
[30:28] Shepherd to take care of the sheep that
[30:32] was their
[30:33] occupation but somehow between that
[30:35] space of time and what we read in Exodus
[30:37] their focus
[30:38] shifted well rather than their
[30:40] occupation being about the business of
[30:43] the sheep it became about building
[30:45] treasure cities for Pharaoh they forgot
[30:49] they got caught up in another
[30:53] occupation and you know they even got to
[30:56] the point where they believed their
[30:57] survival was based on their ability to
[31:01] build Pharaoh's treasure
[31:03] cities but their occupation had been
[31:08] Shepherds you know and finally it took a
[31:10] time
[31:11] where they began to seek again for the
[31:14] presence of the Lord and then God came
[31:17] on the scene as we know you know but his
[31:20] people have a
[31:21] purpose there's work there to be
[31:24] about and if we're not careful
[31:27] we can be utterly occupied by the drum
[31:30] beat of life and be consumed eaten up
[31:34] with the our activities of
[31:38] life you know there are a couple of
[31:40] other statements that David makes here
[31:42] in the psalm as we get ready to read
[31:45] it he
[31:47] says that there is one thing about these
[31:50] people says in verse 5 there were they
[31:53] in great fear for God is in the
[31:56] generation of the
[32:00] righteous you know all
[32:02] those daily things that can be
[32:04] occupation forces
[32:07] nevertheless God is in his
[32:10] people you know and as I got to thinking
[32:12] about that more you read late further on
[32:13] in the psalm it says that in verse 6 the
[32:16] Lord is their refuge and I was reminded
[32:19] of the statement that Jesus made if I
[32:22] abide in you and ye abide in me ye shall
[32:26] ask what you will and it shall be done
[32:29] unto
[32:31] you you know if we can continue to abide
[32:35] and not get dis and recognize his
[32:37] presence and not get
[32:39] occupied by the drum beat of our
[32:44] thing there's nothing we can't ask in
[32:48] fact go to verse seven he wraps up with
[32:51] this
[32:51] statement oh that the salvation of
[32:54] Israel would come out of Zion you know I
[32:56] was was thinking about that and you know
[33:00] if we can just stay tuned to his
[33:03] presence his desire is that his people
[33:07] actually
[33:08] become his presence in the earth so
[33:13] rather than it being about us trying to
[33:16] remember and recognize his presence in
[33:18] our daily lives we come to such a place
[33:20] that we become his presence on the earth
[33:25] what a contrast
[33:28] you know and and this has happened
[33:31] before once there was one who appeared
[33:33] in a fiery furnace and a Godless King
[33:36] looked at him and said you know what
[33:38] that's what a Son of God looks
[33:40] like you know and John said that you
[33:44] know Jesus said that uh or the
[33:46] scriptures say that he was the firstborn
[33:47] of many
[33:49] Brethren you know in John 1 says that as
[33:52] many as believed him to them gave he
[33:55] power to become the sons of God
[33:58] but then one John later says now are we
[34:00] the sons of
[34:02] God and we know this that when he shall
[34:06] appear how many believe he has appeared
[34:09] we shall be like
[34:13] him and we know also from the scripture
[34:15] that all creation is groaning and
[34:17] travailing waiting for the
[34:19] manifestation of the sons of God the
[34:22] presence of God on the earth let's stand
[34:27] this morning and you know as we read the
[34:30] psalm you know my prayer is that I don't
[34:33] fail to recognize his presence each day
[34:36] not just in church not just when there's
[34:38] a service and the music is playing or
[34:39] the minister is preaching but in my
[34:42] daily
[34:44] thing am I acknowledging his presence
[34:48] recognizing his presence and not getting
[34:51] occupied by the occupation forces so
[34:54] that I can be his presence
[34:57] in the earth let's read that Psalm 14
[35:01] together it's just a short Psalm the
[35:03] fool hath said in his heart there is no
[35:05] God they are corrupt they have done
[35:08] abominable works there is none that
[35:10] doeth good the Lord looked down from
[35:13] heaven upon the children of men to see
[35:15] if there were any that did understand
[35:17] and seek God they are all gone aside
[35:19] they are all together become filthy
[35:22] there is none that doeth good know not
[35:24] one have all the workers of in it no
[35:27] knowledge who eat up my people as they
[35:29] eat bread and call not upon the Lord
[35:32] there were they in great fear for God is
[35:35] in the generation of the righteous you
[35:37] have shamed the counsel of the poor
[35:39] because the Lord is his Refuge oh that
[35:42] the salvation of Israel were come out of
[35:44] Zion when the Lord bringeth back the
[35:46] Captivity of his people Jacob shall
[35:49] rejoice and Israel shall be
[35:51] glad amen praise the Lord you may have
[35:55] your seats I want to sing that song my
[35:57] my my what a joy it
[36:00] is it's cold
[36:03] outside what about in your heart I think
[36:06] the important thing is if it's cold in
[36:07] your heart well let's don't stay that
[36:10] way you can come be warned by the
[36:12] presence of the Lord you can be
[36:13] delivered you can be baptized with the
[36:15] Holy Ghost and it really don't matter
[36:17] what's going on out there as long as
[36:18] you're serving Jesus amen we now oh my
[36:22] my my oh what a joy to serve my Jesus
[36:28] oh that I could explain the way I
[36:32] feel rejoicing in unspeakable joy and

[36:45] my what a joy to serve my

[37:12] Jubilation when Jesus came anded my
[37:17] away now he gives me strength and power

[37:25] heart and soul I now can say hallelujah

[59:52] have break the cold to be here you know
[59:54] I woke up this morning I almost changed
[59:56] the title of my message you know I was
[59:59] going to call it the uh winter breathing
[1:00:01] Christians the kind that God is looking
[1:00:04] for amen but I realize that would be too
[1:00:06] obvious amen let's open our Bibles and
[1:00:10] um in Romans chapter one just a short
[1:00:14] scripture
[1:00:20] reading let's start from verse
[1:00:23] eight
[1:00:29] it says
[1:00:31] first I thank I thank my God through
[1:00:34] Jesus Christ for you
[1:00:37] all that says that your faith is spoken
[1:00:41] throughout the whole worlden don't you
[1:00:44] want your faith to be spoken of you amen
[1:00:47] when they hear of your faith they know
[1:00:48] that those are those that are standing
[1:00:50] on God's word it said that for God
[1:00:55] is my
[1:00:56] witness whom I
[1:00:58] serve with my spirit in the gospel of
[1:01:01] his son that without ceasing I make
[1:01:05] mention of you always in my prayers I
[1:01:08] said Romans chapter one and I'm reading
[1:01:10] from verse 10 right now it says making
[1:01:13] request if by any means now at length
[1:01:17] that I might have the prosperous
[1:01:20] journey by the will of God to come unto
[1:01:23] you for I long to see you that I may
[1:01:27] impart unto you some spiritual gift to
[1:01:30] the end to the end that ye may be
[1:01:33] established that is that I may be
[1:01:36] comforted that that I may be comforted
[1:01:39] together with you by the mutual Faith
[1:01:42] both you and me it says now that I would
[1:01:46] I would not have you ignorant Brethren
[1:01:50] that often
[1:01:51] time our purpose to come unto you you
[1:01:54] but was led here to that I may I might
[1:01:59] have some fruits among you also even
[1:02:02] among other Gentiles it says I am a dead
[1:02:06] both of the of the Greeks and of the
[1:02:09] babarian and both of the wise and the
[1:02:11] unwise so as much as I'm in as much as
[1:02:17] I'm in as is in me is I am ready to
[1:02:21] preach the gospel unto you that I at
[1:02:25] that are at Rome also for I am not
[1:02:27] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[1:02:31] is the power of God unto salvation to
[1:02:34] everyone that believe it says to the
[1:02:37] Jews first and also to the Greek for
[1:02:41] wherein it is righteousness of God
[1:02:44] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[1:02:48] written the the the the just shall live
[1:02:51] by faith amen let's also turn uh John
[1:02:55] chapter 17 we're just going to
[1:02:58] read one or two verses there John
[1:03:01] chapter
[1:03:07] 17 and we're going to read
[1:03:13] verse uh one two and three says these
[1:03:17] words spake Jesus and and and lifted up
[1:03:20] his eyes in heaven and said father the
[1:03:23] hour is coming glorify thy son that thy
[1:03:26] son Also may glorify thee as thou had
[1:03:30] given him Power Over All Flesh that he
[1:03:33] should give eternal life to as many as
[1:03:37] thou had given
[1:03:39] him so that's what the the son is asking
[1:03:43] for it
[1:03:45] says
[1:03:47] and this is eternal life that they may
[1:03:51] Know Thee the only true God God and
[1:03:55] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent father
[1:03:59] we ask you bless the word to us this
[1:04:01] morning we commit it to you in the name
[1:04:02] of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may
[1:04:05] have your seats this
[1:04:23] morning
[1:04:26] I want to just for a few moment this
[1:04:29] morning uh speak on just something that
[1:04:33] has been on my heart and you know you
[1:04:37] you you sit and you listen to a pastor
[1:04:40] preach and you as
[1:04:44] a and I believe this goes along as all
[1:04:48] of us not necessarily just as ministers
[1:04:52] but you you really try to capture sure
[1:04:54] where his mind is at and and what God is
[1:04:57] dealing with him at because really you
[1:05:01] you when you hear the word of God you
[1:05:04] you try to really see what is God trying
[1:05:06] to tell us what is God trying to
[1:05:09] encourage Us in and I want to just for
[1:05:12] uh this morning to give it a title I
[1:05:14] want to speak on the reality of the
[1:05:18] Living God and the reality of the Living
[1:05:22] God my my my heart not necessarily my
[1:05:26] mind um I believe brother Matthew used
[1:05:29] this scripture about the woman at the
[1:05:31] well in John 4 um and and I was just
[1:05:36] meditating on it I went back home and I
[1:05:39] sat and I was looking at it and and and
[1:05:41] I just began to to dwell on it and just
[1:05:44] let the word speak to my heart and and
[1:05:47] and I thought I remember places where
[1:05:50] the Prophet will speak and we know that
[1:05:53] most of what he would say or some of the
[1:05:55] things that he would say that these were
[1:05:58] things that were ministered to him by
[1:06:00] angels and and I I say that because it's
[1:06:03] important the message that we have
[1:06:06] received it's not William bram's
[1:06:09] interpretation of what the Bible is it's
[1:06:12] not some man sitting somewhere and
[1:06:14] taking his Bible and taking the
[1:06:17] concordance or taking a a by a study
[1:06:20] Bible and putting it together and
[1:06:23] presenting to and say that this is what
[1:06:25] I think this means no but some of the
[1:06:27] things we hear come out of his mouth
[1:06:30] were directly T to him by an Angel and
[1:06:33] he's only repeating the word of an Angel
[1:06:35] to
[1:06:36] you and in fact I want to say this not
[1:06:39] just some of the things but the entire
[1:06:42] message of the
[1:06:43] hour it's not a man trying to interpret
[1:06:46] what God Said but it's God himself
[1:06:48] speaking to you speaking to this
[1:06:51] generation and and why is he do that
[1:06:54] because God wants to communicate to you
[1:06:57] what his desire is at the end time
[1:07:00] because God is here calling his sons and
[1:07:03] his daughter and he wants to give you a
[1:07:06] word that will bring a change in your
[1:07:10] life and and we can say this morning and
[1:07:13] I
[1:07:14] was I was thinking about it as you we
[1:07:17] sit here th this is not a mind of man
[1:07:21] being given to another man so we can
[1:07:24] come in fellowship with what we're
[1:07:25] thinking but the word of the end time
[1:07:28] was given so that it would produce a
[1:07:32] quality bride that Jesus Christ himself
[1:07:35] was looking for and I want to say this
[1:07:37] to to get to where I'm going uh I if
[1:07:41] someone was to tell me this morning that
[1:07:44] hey uh you know brother Matthew has got
[1:07:47] a gift for you and and I will say oh but
[1:07:50] Matthew's got a gift for me and I will
[1:07:52] hear about it I'll be excited I'll be
[1:07:55] happy oh P Matthew's got a gift for me
[1:07:58] oh yeah that's wonderful but there's
[1:08:00] going to come a time where I need to go
[1:08:03] and breed ber Matthew myself and get the
[1:08:05] gift that he has for
[1:08:07] me and I'm speaking about the reality of
[1:08:10] a living God there there's going to come
[1:08:13] a time where just hearing that brother
[1:08:16] Matthew has a gift for me will no longer
[1:08:19] satisfy it there was going to come a
[1:08:21] time where I I could hear it but yet yet
[1:08:24] there's something missing between what
[1:08:26] I'm hearing and the reality itself so I
[1:08:30] got to move from just hearing what
[1:08:32] brother Matthew has for me into moving
[1:08:34] where what brother Matthew has for me
[1:08:37] and me we become
[1:08:41] one and and that's where our hearts has
[1:08:43] to be because the devil is there to
[1:08:46] Buffet us every moment the devil is here
[1:08:49] to try to make us church members he's
[1:08:52] just trying to make us satisfied we
[1:08:54] reading our Bibles and I said well I
[1:08:56] read the Bible and I read the message
[1:08:58] yeah that's good and and I say that's
[1:09:00] wonderful but don't just stop there let
[1:09:03] the owner of the word that you are
[1:09:05] reading in let him take that word and
[1:09:07] make it a reality in your life the
[1:09:11] reality of the Living God there's a
[1:09:13] person who spoke the word that you're
[1:09:16] reading it's not someone it didn't come
[1:09:19] from the sky someone spoke it so you got
[1:09:21] to find out who spoke this word words
[1:09:24] who is it that wrote this word who is
[1:09:26] the author of the word that I'm reading
[1:09:28] in and I want to meet him for
[1:09:31] myself we we cannot be satisfied with
[1:09:34] just hearing the hearing and the doing
[1:09:37] has to come together and it's not for
[1:09:39] you to bring it he's the one who brings
[1:09:41] it together but it's for us to hunger
[1:09:45] for it you know I was thinking you know
[1:09:48] if my my kids if I ever promise them
[1:09:50] something I'm in
[1:09:52] trouble you know we'll come to church
[1:09:54] and you know we'll say well you know
[1:09:56] after church and you know I I'll get you
[1:09:59] guys a hamburger or something oh my
[1:10:01] goodness I don't even think they will
[1:10:03] hear any me anything that was preaching
[1:10:05] a sermon they they will be there and
[1:10:08] just waiting in anticipation and you
[1:10:10] know I because I'm the last one to get
[1:10:12] in the car when I get in the car if
[1:10:15] there's a complete silence I know
[1:10:17] something is going on why because it's
[1:10:19] the only time that they come together
[1:10:21] and they can work together any at the
[1:10:24] time they're fighting so the moment I
[1:10:26] say something they come together and
[1:10:28] they wait in anticipation the moment I
[1:10:30] get in the car they remind me of my
[1:10:33] promise oh if we can come together as
[1:10:36] children of God if we can put our fights
[1:10:38] on the side and if we can come together
[1:10:41] this morning as one and and say God you
[1:10:44] promis in your word you said you will do
[1:10:46] this and you will do that God will make
[1:10:49] his word reality God and His word are
[1:10:52] not two separate things and the problem
[1:10:54] is the problem is people take the text
[1:10:57] and they give their own interpretation
[1:10:59] and their own understanding they don't
[1:11:01] follow what the author wants and what he
[1:11:03] wanted to do with his word what we need
[1:11:05] is to take his word right back to
[1:11:07] himself and let him make it a reality to
[1:11:11] us not be satisfied with some kind of
[1:11:14] interpretation and we we've taken men
[1:11:17] and put them between God and us and and
[1:11:20] every time we read and we go back to
[1:11:22] that man what is this mean what he no
[1:11:24] God don't want that kind of relationship
[1:11:27] he wants a relationship where he can
[1:11:29] speak to you directly from his own
[1:11:33] word and as Believers of this message we
[1:11:37] we can come here this morning and said
[1:11:39] this message promises God will give us
[1:11:41] good health this message promises we'll
[1:11:44] have a body change this message promises
[1:11:47] that will be the perfect Bride of the
[1:11:49] end time this message promises that the
[1:11:51] works that Jesus did we shall do also
[1:11:55] this message is the only thing that
[1:11:57] promis that is been sent to make a bride
[1:11:59] ready so therefore if I partake of this
[1:12:02] message my expectation is the owner of
[1:12:05] the message will come and make me what
[1:12:08] he promised he will do I expect nothing
[1:12:11] less but
[1:12:12] that don't be satisfied with men's
[1:12:16] understanding within her like ask for
[1:12:18] God to make his word a reality in your
[1:12:22] life you said you a Healer and I'm sick
[1:12:26] I'm not going anywhere I'm standing on
[1:12:29] your word I'm going to call upon your
[1:12:31] name day and night I'll be like that
[1:12:34] woman in front of the church until he
[1:12:36] gets tired of me I'll stand there until
[1:12:39] his word is a very reality that's how
[1:12:42] the Saints of the Old Testament
[1:12:44] lived they didn't take any man's word
[1:12:47] for it our pastor preacher a moment ago
[1:12:49] they didn't have a Bible they didn't
[1:12:51] have anything but the moment the word
[1:12:54] was inspired to them they stay there
[1:12:56] until God made it a
[1:12:58] reality no but we hop here we hop over
[1:13:01] there and we'll he here and then someone
[1:13:04] will come and give a different
[1:13:06] interpretation well when Jesus said a
[1:13:08] mountain it was not really a
[1:13:13] mountain
[1:13:15] really if Jesus said a mountain it's a
[1:13:19] mountain now the mountain could be
[1:13:21] whatever is in your life whatever
[1:13:23] mountain is going but it didn't mean it
[1:13:25] wasn't a mountain it was whatever
[1:13:27] obstacle stands before you and the word
[1:13:29] of God let God come and remove the
[1:13:34] obstacle oh
[1:13:37] my something that can match what was
[1:13:41] spoken with what I'm seeing in my life
[1:13:44] that's the reality I'm looking for amen
[1:13:47] God bless you the musician come no I'm
[1:13:49] just
[1:13:52] kidding
[1:13:54] I'm going to get cornered there by the
[1:13:55] deacons
[1:14:02] before so I
[1:14:05] was as I said I was thinking about the
[1:14:08] scripture in ch in John chapter 4 and
[1:14:11] I'll just try to take my time and don't
[1:14:15] worry about the clock we'll stop
[1:14:17] whenever we feel is enough and and the
[1:14:20] goal is not to finish up everything it's
[1:14:22] just to say something that's of benefit
[1:14:24] that we can take before we
[1:14:28] leave so the scripture would say if you
[1:14:32] could put it up in John chapter 4 it
[1:14:33] says
[1:14:35] therefore when the Lord knew that the
[1:14:37] Pharisees had heard that Jesus
[1:14:41] made Jesus made and baptized more
[1:14:44] disciples than
[1:14:45] John it says though Jesus himself did
[1:14:48] not baptize but his disciples he left
[1:14:51] Judea and departed again into
[1:14:54] Galilee but he
[1:14:57] needed to go through
[1:15:00] Samaria he needs to go to Samaria and I
[1:15:04] say Lord come this morning by my way I I
[1:15:07] have a need of you that you know God has
[1:15:10] never forgotten any of his believing
[1:15:13] children God has never forgotten his
[1:15:16] Plan of Redemption it doesn't matter
[1:15:19] what condition you are in if there's a
[1:15:21] heart cry within you God will come by
[1:15:24] your way the the the the very word of
[1:15:27] God and let me just say this before I
[1:15:29] can continue we we often time need to
[1:15:32] work and I'll say this many times as I
[1:15:34] move we need to work on our relationship
[1:15:37] with the word of God because you you
[1:15:40] cannot just every time you pick up the
[1:15:43] word of God when you read all you see is
[1:15:46] condemnation and and law and God telling
[1:15:48] you do this and don't do that or do this
[1:15:51] or don't no that's the wrong kind of
[1:15:53] relationship if you see it that way pray
[1:15:56] that God will help you because it's more
[1:15:58] than that it it the word of God is
[1:16:03] life the word of God is the only life
[1:16:06] you can ever have the word of God is s
[1:16:09] to save you from yourself the word of
[1:16:12] God is given to help you God has never
[1:16:15] sent his word to his children to destroy
[1:16:17] them the word every time he sent is to
[1:16:19] take you out of sin out of whatever
[1:16:22] condition you find yourself in and bring
[1:16:24] you into the fold of God so if you view
[1:16:27] the word of God as condemnation ask for
[1:16:30] God to help you this
[1:16:33] morning he may come with
[1:16:35] instructions he may come and rebuke you
[1:16:38] of something but the end goal is to save
[1:16:41] you the end goal is to do you good is
[1:16:46] not to forsake
[1:16:48] you so he as he speaks in the word he
[1:16:52] says I have need to go to Samaria so his
[1:16:56] heart's desire was perhaps they saw a
[1:16:59] vision of this woman who had a need and
[1:17:02] and he knew that he was send to the
[1:17:05] lordship of Israel he doesn't come for
[1:17:08] those that think they've got it all
[1:17:09] together he doesn't come for those that
[1:17:12] think they don't need him but he comes
[1:17:14] to those that know I have need of him
[1:17:16] this morning and our attitude towards
[1:17:19] the word has to be of Lord we need more
[1:17:22] of you than we ever had it before I I
[1:17:25] say this I woke up this morning and and
[1:17:28] in my hearts I just began to realize
[1:17:30] Lord I need more of your spirit like I
[1:17:32] never needed it
[1:17:35] before you you can never have enough of
[1:17:38] the Holy Spirit you can never have
[1:17:40] enough of God we we always constantly
[1:17:43] need him and and need him to come and
[1:17:45] live within
[1:17:48] us and so the scripture will say and he
[1:17:52] came to a city of Samaria which is
[1:17:54] called Saar near the plot of ground that
[1:17:58] Jacob had given to his son Joseph it
[1:18:01] says now Jacob's Well was there and
[1:18:03] Jesus therefore therefore he says being
[1:18:07] wearied from his journey D he said set
[1:18:10] dust by the well and it was about a six
[1:18:19] hour it says that a woman came to drw
[1:18:22] water Jesus said to her give me to give
[1:18:25] me a
[1:18:27] drink for his disciple had gone away
[1:18:29] into the
[1:18:30] city to buy food it says the woman of
[1:18:34] Samaria said to
[1:18:37] him it says how be
[1:18:41] it how it says how be it you being a Jew
[1:18:45] asked a drink from me a Samaritan woman
[1:18:49] the Jews have no dealing with Samaritan
[1:18:54] now we we understand if we read through
[1:18:56] history the the reason being that the
[1:18:59] the the Samaritan were a mixed group of
[1:19:01] people when when I believe it was
[1:19:03] Nebuchadnezzar when they took the Jews
[1:19:05] when they when they came and he took
[1:19:07] what they would do is they will take all
[1:19:08] the young men out of the country and
[1:19:11] they will leave only the old people and
[1:19:13] what they will do is they will disperse
[1:19:15] them so they can completely forget about
[1:19:17] the culture and everything and we'll
[1:19:18] take them and try to mix them so that
[1:19:21] the whole race is gone they will
[1:19:23] remember nothing of what they were so
[1:19:25] the Jews had this against the Samaritan
[1:19:28] because they were mixed people so here
[1:19:30] he is the word of God is speaking to her
[1:19:34] all she's looking at is the existing
[1:19:36] conflict within her
[1:19:39] life the word of God is come and
[1:19:42] speaking directly through her yes he is
[1:19:46] she's looking at the word through the
[1:19:48] prism of where she comes from oh I can't
[1:19:51] take this this cannot be for me I can't
[1:19:54] accept this what you're saying is
[1:19:56] against the law and what it's against
[1:19:59] the nature it's against what has been
[1:20:02] she she has some precedence within her
[1:20:04] own mind of why she cannot act the way
[1:20:08] that Jesus is asking
[1:20:11] her the word comes and says oh God is
[1:20:14] here to make you holy oh I cannot be
[1:20:16] made holy because I've been the file
[1:20:19] from where I come from the word is
[1:20:22] calling and saying oh come and do this
[1:20:25] and we we have some preconceived ideas
[1:20:28] within our mind well it it cannot it can
[1:20:31] only be this way it cannot be that way
[1:20:34] but Jesus is here speaking to
[1:20:38] you and yet ourselves being caught up
[1:20:41] with what history is and then Jesus
[1:20:44] answer unto her it says oh if th knew
[1:20:47] the gift of
[1:20:49] God and who is it that says to you give
[1:20:52] give me a drink he says you would have
[1:20:55] asked me and I would have given it I
[1:20:57] would have given you the Living Water so
[1:21:00] now Jesus is wanting her to understand
[1:21:03] oh I love this because he he didn't cast
[1:21:06] her out he didn't go he was so patient
[1:21:09] with her now remember Pam told us that
[1:21:12] yes Jesus is trying to contact her
[1:21:15] spirit the word is Supernatural the word
[1:21:19] is spiritual but yes he is taking
[1:21:22] everything carnal uh uh expressing or
[1:21:25] always viewing everything that's being
[1:21:27] spoken through the carnal lenses the
[1:21:29] word is trying to contact the spirit
[1:21:31] she's rejecting it why because of all
[1:21:33] the carnality that has taken place oh I
[1:21:36] wonder how many times we do
[1:21:39] that but if you knew the gift of God
[1:21:42] what is the gift of God the gift of God
[1:21:45] is it doesn't matter what was God can
[1:21:48] make a new
[1:21:49] thing what is the gift of God it doesn't
[1:21:52] matter how much sin you find yourself in
[1:21:55] this morning the word of God has the
[1:21:57] power to change your
[1:22:00] situation you know the devil is the
[1:22:03] master in twisting our lives and getting
[1:22:05] us in circumstances we don't understand
[1:22:09] he will take your life and put you in so
[1:22:11] much trouble you're like well in the
[1:22:14] situation I'm in God can't accept me but
[1:22:17] the word is here it says oh if you only
[1:22:18] knew the gift of God huj the gift of God
[1:22:21] is he can take you and wash you clean
[1:22:25] the gift of God is the blood of Jesus
[1:22:27] Christ is the most powerful thing that
[1:22:32] exists it doesn't matter where you've
[1:22:34] been it in let me say this and and hour
[1:22:38] from an hour before now it doesn't
[1:22:41] matter in the presence of
[1:22:43] God the second that just went by it
[1:22:46] doesn't matter before God what matters
[1:22:48] is what you do now you accept the word
[1:22:51] God is able to bring it a reality to
[1:22:54] you oh I did this and I done that and
[1:22:57] I've been caught up in this and and what
[1:23:00] is just speaking it says forget about
[1:23:02] all of
[1:23:04] that if you only knew the gift of
[1:23:08] God to try to see
[1:23:11] God as the new thing when when when we
[1:23:15] approach to to to see the gift of God to
[1:23:19] understand the gift of God is is to
[1:23:22] understand that it doesn't matter what
[1:23:24] the past has told
[1:23:27] you it doesn't matter what my
[1:23:29] circumstance is this morning I I don't
[1:23:32] rely I don't take the past to determine
[1:23:35] the future I like the word of God
[1:23:38] determine what my future is going to be
[1:23:40] I take what God has said to direct my
[1:23:43] life I take the promise of God in order
[1:23:46] to direct him to let him direct my
[1:23:50] life the gift of God
[1:23:53] stands by your own self it's not to be
[1:23:56] mixed with anything it's not to be mixed
[1:23:59] with what you wear what you could have
[1:24:01] been it's only stand by its own self and
[1:24:04] it's only based upon the promise that he
[1:24:06] has made to
[1:24:10] you the woman said unto him
[1:24:13] sir you have nothing to draw on she
[1:24:17] still doesn't get it she's saying you
[1:24:20] have nothing to draw and and the well is
[1:24:23] deep he says where then do you get this
[1:24:27] living water are you greater than our
[1:24:29] father Jacob who gave us this well and
[1:24:32] drank from it himself as well as his
[1:24:35] sons and his Liv and his livestocks so
[1:24:39] yeah the word is being spoken she's
[1:24:42] caught up in the formula in the
[1:24:44] calculation well there's the well if
[1:24:47] this man says he's going to give me
[1:24:48] water he has to have a bucket he has to
[1:24:51] have some type of of rope he has to have
[1:24:53] a way to go down deep this well and get
[1:24:56] the water he's not talking about the
[1:24:58] natural water he's not talking about
[1:25:01] what you think it's not talking about
[1:25:03] what your process of life is let me say
[1:25:06] this I I was so moved as I was just the
[1:25:09] scripture was just opening to my heart I
[1:25:11] I began to think about the message that
[1:25:13] I'm preach let me just take this for a
[1:25:15] second I thought I was not going to
[1:25:17] sweat
[1:25:18] but I guess I just can't overcome that
[1:25:23] I was telling the deacons I need a
[1:25:24] sweatband and and a headband so I could
[1:25:27] just I'll be probably be the first
[1:25:29] preacher to do
[1:25:31] that so yeah I was thinking about butam
[1:25:34] speaks about testimony on the sea I want
[1:25:37] you to think these disciples they're
[1:25:39] sitting there and the they're talking
[1:25:42] about what Jesus had done in those
[1:25:43] things and one of them speaks about how
[1:25:46] he takes the fish and the bread and he
[1:25:48] begins to break it now he asked he said
[1:25:51] oh he said how did they do that does
[1:25:54] that mean that God has some offen in
[1:25:56] heaven and and that they will bake bread
[1:25:59] quickly and as he as it will cause the
[1:26:02] brain to fall down and he will
[1:26:04] distribute it he says no God is a
[1:26:07] Creator now I want you to the natural
[1:26:10] process that we go through is for
[1:26:12] mankind it's not for God the the
[1:26:15] principle of understanding that before
[1:26:17] you can touch water you have to have a
[1:26:19] bucket you have to have all of that
[1:26:21] that's what men do
[1:26:22] but God is Not So we cannot H God to
[1:26:25] men's
[1:26:27] standard so when when he speaks now he's
[1:26:30] trying to get it to understand so he
[1:26:32] says no God is a Creator he says when he
[1:26:35] takes that bread and he breaks off a
[1:26:38] piece off of it God being a Creator he
[1:26:41] bypasses the whole process he creates
[1:26:44] another piece right back to what was
[1:26:47] before why because he has the power to
[1:26:50] do
[1:26:51] that
[1:27:01] she's completely
[1:27:04] oblivious she's she doesn't understand
[1:27:07] in who pres she's standing y he is
[1:27:10] speaking of spiritual things she's
[1:27:13] taking it all in in the cornal mind and
[1:27:16] look until that time Jesus is still
[1:27:19] patient with her why because he knows
[1:27:22] he's been sent to help her and I thought
[1:27:24] within my heart I said we we have to
[1:27:27] learn to be patient with people that
[1:27:29] don't
[1:27:31] understand you know it's easier you see
[1:27:34] whether someone you see at at the altar
[1:27:37] all the time or you see someone exhibit
[1:27:39] some behaviors you don't understand be
[1:27:41] patient with that person let me say that
[1:27:44] someone who comes with an alar at don't
[1:27:46] time I have more respect for him than
[1:27:48] someone who's
[1:27:51] pretending AB at least they are honest
[1:27:53] somewhere at least someone God God will
[1:27:56] look at it and he will have respect for
[1:27:58] them than someone who's pretending to
[1:28:01] have had it all so what we need is to
[1:28:04] understand that the process we are not
[1:28:07] responsible for the process the process
[1:28:09] is God's process of bringing
[1:28:16] people so J Jesus answered and said unto
[1:28:20] her who so whoever drinks of this water
[1:28:24] that you came to get here will thirst
[1:28:28] again but whosoever will drink of the
[1:28:30] water that I shall give will never
[1:28:34] thirst again now this is getting
[1:28:37] interesting because now every one by one
[1:28:42] her understanding is getting completely
[1:28:44] shattered about what God is offering her
[1:28:47] understanding of what Jesus is offering
[1:28:49] is being broken down little by little
[1:28:52] but whatever he says but the water that
[1:28:55] I shall give that I shall give him will
[1:28:58] become in him a fountain of water that
[1:29:02] springing up unto everlasting life the
[1:29:06] woman said sir give me this
[1:29:09] water so she heard the W the word of God
[1:29:12] long enough until she got
[1:29:15] thirsty she heard she heard it and he
[1:29:19] continually to speak spoke to her until
[1:29:22] she got thirsty until she came to a
[1:29:24] place I said I don't understand what it
[1:29:26] is saying I don't understand where this
[1:29:28] water is coming from but just give me of
[1:29:30] that water oh I wonder how many time any
[1:29:33] of us can just come this morning and say
[1:29:36] father I may not have a complete
[1:29:38] understanding of the entire Bible I may
[1:29:40] not have understanding of the entire
[1:29:42] mystery but I need that water this
[1:29:44] morning give me that water that I may
[1:29:50] live Jesus looked at her and
[1:29:54] said go call go call your husband and
[1:29:58] come
[1:30:00] here now that's a complete
[1:30:05] twist that's a 360
[1:30:08] yeah I thought we were talking about
[1:30:14] water how is it that the water you're
[1:30:17] GNA give me is directly connected with
[1:30:20] me going to get my husband
[1:30:23] are we still talking about the same
[1:30:25] water that I'm thinking of or you
[1:30:27] thinking about a different water how
[1:30:29] many different types of water are we is
[1:30:33] there you see the water that Jesus was
[1:30:37] giving her was directly connected with
[1:30:39] what was happening in her
[1:30:43] life the water that Jesus was offering
[1:30:47] was going to fix her life once and for
[1:30:49] all amen the water that Jesus off offers
[1:30:52] it doesn't give you water so you can go
[1:30:55] back in the same things that you were in
[1:30:57] to begin with the water that he's giving
[1:31:00] Is Not to cause to send you right back
[1:31:02] into the world and the things that you
[1:31:04] were once you drink of his water your
[1:31:07] life is change
[1:31:09] forever and that's what we need to
[1:31:12] understand this morning the word of God
[1:31:13] is here to change our lives it's the
[1:31:16] water that changes you forever it's the
[1:31:19] word that brings complete transformation
[1:31:21] in your life
[1:31:26] so she comes and there was the water
[1:31:29] that Jesus was giving the water that
[1:31:31] Jesus would to help her so she can get
[1:31:34] out of the mess she was
[1:31:38] in and the woman
[1:31:40] said I have no
[1:31:44] husband Jesus
[1:31:46] said
[1:31:49] now he's already captive he's completely
[1:31:53] captivated his spirit and he's read you
[1:31:56] know I I I I love this as I read it
[1:32:00] because I see the ministry of our
[1:32:02] Prophet being manifested once again the
[1:32:05] the same thing that he did because you
[1:32:07] have to understand that's how you know
[1:32:09] that it's the same Jesus yesterday who
[1:32:11] is the same Jesus today is by seeing
[1:32:14] that this was not a man this was Jesus
[1:32:17] Christ performing the same thing that he
[1:32:19] did because remember the promise was the
[1:32:21] same that he did to the Jews and Gentile
[1:32:23] he will have to do it to the to sorry
[1:32:26] sorry to the Jews and the Samaritan has
[1:32:28] to be reproduced to the Gentile so he's
[1:32:30] here doing exactly the same thing now
[1:32:34] having a spirit captive he looks at him
[1:32:36] and
[1:32:37] says you have said
[1:32:40] well you have no
[1:32:43] husband you have had five husband and
[1:32:46] the one that you have now is not even
[1:32:49] your
[1:32:50] husband in that God you have spoken
[1:32:54] truly now we let me say this we fall
[1:32:57] under the influence of many
[1:33:01] things and often time we let the devil
[1:33:04] come and say well that's that's what you
[1:33:07] are even as our M said this morning you
[1:33:10] look at yourself and you define Yourself
[1:33:13] by the job you are doing oh I'm an
[1:33:16] engineer if they ask you the first thing
[1:33:18] that comes out oh I'm an
[1:33:20] engineer no not even a thought I'm a Son
[1:33:23] of God first before I became an engineer
[1:33:26] no I'm an engineer I'm this I'm a nurse
[1:33:29] I'm that why because that's that's
[1:33:32] that's the the mentality that's what
[1:33:34] caral carnality has done to us that's
[1:33:37] what the devil we have been captivated
[1:33:40] he's taken things and he said well you
[1:33:42] know that's just how you are and we've
[1:33:44] taken it yes Jesus telling the woman he
[1:33:47] says all of the people that you have
[1:33:49] been they're not even your husband
[1:33:52] your true husband is your maker your
[1:33:55] true husband is your creator everybody
[1:33:58] else is a squatter that's why he says
[1:34:00] when we read invisible union he says
[1:34:02] that husband the first husband that came
[1:34:05] that you were born under he says it
[1:34:06] wasn't even your fault to begin with you
[1:34:09] were caught into that but your true
[1:34:11] husband is standing here why because
[1:34:14] he's the one who created you and in
[1:34:16] creating you he had a purpose for
[1:34:19] you therefore he can look at you and say
[1:34:22] you have had four and the one you have
[1:34:24] is not even your husband why because
[1:34:26] your true husband is standing in front
[1:34:28] of you right
[1:34:31] now the word of God the reality and let
[1:34:35] me say this morning before I move on
[1:34:37] it's only Christ that can bring its
[1:34:40] reality to you a preacher cannot do it
[1:34:44] the Bible cannot do it anybody the word
[1:34:47] the not a written letter but you have to
[1:34:50] let God step out of the Written Letter
[1:34:53] and come and he make himself a real to
[1:34:55] you that's how you know him but what I'm
[1:34:58] says this God is not known by intellect
[1:35:01] it's known by
[1:35:04] experience it's by him coming out of the
[1:35:08] pages of the Bible and becoming a
[1:35:11] reality to you the reason we read is so
[1:35:14] is so not we can be caught with a letter
[1:35:17] but it's so that the letter can tell us
[1:35:19] about what our husband is so we can now
[1:35:22] have relationship with a husband if it's
[1:35:25] the letter then how many churches do you
[1:35:27] have all around the
[1:35:32] corner we but like our Pastor said we
[1:35:35] are not a people we are not a I'm sorry
[1:35:38] we are not just a a church member or a
[1:35:41] religion but we are a people the the the
[1:35:45] the end time message is God calling out
[1:35:48] a people by his own
[1:35:50] name it's not a gathering of people that
[1:35:53] want to come and study the Bible no it's
[1:35:55] a predestinated group of people that God
[1:35:58] had in his mind in the
[1:36:05] beginning and the woman said
[1:36:08] sir now she catches
[1:36:11] it I perceive you are a
[1:36:14] prophet but now listen to what he said
[1:36:17] ni a father worshiped in the
[1:36:20] mountain and and and you Jews say that
[1:36:23] it is that is in Jerusalem is the place
[1:36:26] of worship where we ought to
[1:36:31] worship when the word is revealed to her
[1:36:33] when she realize when it's was present
[1:36:36] she's standing she wants to worship now
[1:36:40] she wants to offer worship and Jesus
[1:36:43] answered and said to her
[1:36:45] woman believe me the hour has
[1:36:48] come when you will neither be on neither
[1:36:51] be on this mountain nor in Jerusalem
[1:36:54] worship it says no in Jerusalem he said
[1:36:57] the father worshiped the that you will
[1:37:00] neither be on the mountain nor in
[1:37:02] Jerusalem worship the father you will
[1:37:04] worship you worship what you do not know
[1:37:07] he says we know what worship we know
[1:37:11] what we worship for salvation is of the
[1:37:13] Jews but the hour has come it says the
[1:37:16] hour is coming our is when the true
[1:37:18] worshippers will worship the father in
[1:37:20] spirit in truth he says the
[1:37:24] father is seeking such to
[1:37:28] worship to worship him God is a spirit
[1:37:32] and those who worship Him must worship
[1:37:36] Him in spirit and in truth now I know I
[1:37:39] don't want to take too much time with
[1:37:46] this excuse
[1:37:50] me
[1:38:06] let me just point out this before I move
[1:38:10] on by her perceiving now she there is
[1:38:14] this woman in the situation that she was
[1:38:16] in even after she had lost
[1:38:20] everything
[1:38:23] within her heart and mind she was
[1:38:25] waiting for a
[1:38:27] messiah she knew that there was only one
[1:38:30] man who could bring the change in her
[1:38:32] life she knew she has been taught to
[1:38:36] know that regardless of whatever
[1:38:38] situation I was in oh one day if I can
[1:38:41] meet the Messiah my life will not be the
[1:38:43] same again she had this understanding
[1:38:46] within her that regardless of how mess
[1:38:48] up my life is there's one man who who
[1:38:51] can bring about the change so therefore
[1:38:53] when he came and he spoke to her she
[1:38:55] knew that the Messiah was the only one
[1:38:58] who had the ability to go back in the
[1:39:00] past and reveal those things that were
[1:39:02] hidden and if he can go back in the past
[1:39:05] and tell her that he has a power to
[1:39:07] change your
[1:39:08] life and that's why she wanted to
[1:39:11] worship but here is what Jesus told him
[1:39:14] and I thought if you go if you just pay
[1:39:17] attention to what he said to her in a
[1:39:19] moment you'll see how great of a mystery
[1:39:22] he was talking to her about now we
[1:39:25] understand that God had established in
[1:39:27] the Old Testament a worship such that
[1:39:30] they will go and they will offer
[1:39:32] sacrifice on the mountain or they will
[1:39:34] offer sacrifice in temples and all of
[1:39:37] that and when they did that we re we
[1:39:39] understand that God will come and he
[1:39:41] will receive the worship for the burnt
[1:39:43] offering for whatever because it was a
[1:39:45] substitution that God had given them but
[1:39:48] we understand also that the process got
[1:39:50] so polluted Ed to where he just became a
[1:39:53] a Act of doing with no heart or no
[1:39:56] emotional no no sincerity with it it
[1:40:00] just became well I did this and I'll go
[1:40:02] offer up sacrifice so they lost the very
[1:40:05] meaning of what God was give them to do
[1:40:08] so when now Jesus is looking at her and
[1:40:10] saying that the hour is come now
[1:40:13] remember Jesus came to move them from
[1:40:15] the tradition of the father into the new
[1:40:18] tradition and we understand that when he
[1:40:21] died that's how the veil of the temple
[1:40:23] ripped together so the true worship
[1:40:25] could be exposed this woman is one of
[1:40:28] the first to be introduced to that
[1:40:32] worship he's looking at us says the hour
[1:40:35] is now is not yesterday it's not what
[1:40:39] you were doing yesterday what you were
[1:40:41] doing yesterday is no longer
[1:40:45] acceptable the worship of the burnt
[1:40:47] offering of all doing that is no longer
[1:40:49] is no longer uh what's required what's
[1:40:52] required now is that God wants those
[1:40:55] that will worship Him in spirit and in
[1:40:58] truth when the word is being revealed
[1:41:02] the difference is what in the old
[1:41:04] worship when the sacrifice was given the
[1:41:07] life of the animal could not come upon
[1:41:09] on the individual but the new way and
[1:41:12] the introduction of what Jesus was
[1:41:14] telling her was even right now the
[1:41:17] worship has changed to where when the
[1:41:19] sacrifice is accepted that the life of
[1:41:22] the sacrifice will come directly on you
[1:41:25] don't forget
[1:41:27] that so therefore we cannot come to
[1:41:30] church and say we're worshiping God on
[1:41:33] the Bible and on the scripture and the
[1:41:36] spirit of the altar not come upon
[1:41:44] you let me just move on for the second
[1:41:46] of time I pray you excuse my voice I I
[1:41:50] just
[1:41:51] I fa was not good this morning but I
[1:41:53] feel like I just trained it for a moment
[1:41:55] ago so just ask to be patient with
[1:42:07] me she said I
[1:42:12] know that when messiah's
[1:42:16] come who is called
[1:42:19] Christ when he he
[1:42:22] comes he will tell us all
[1:42:27] things he will tell us how to
[1:42:30] worship he'll tell us where to
[1:42:33] worship Jesus was moving the worship
[1:42:36] from a building
[1:42:38] somewhere from a Mountaintop
[1:42:41] somewhere into the hearts of
[1:42:44] individual where God will come The God
[1:42:48] Who was above us The God Who was with us
[1:42:51] could become the God in us the Holy
[1:42:54] Spirit dwelling within the
[1:42:56] individual that's the worship that he's
[1:42:58] looking for Hallelujah that's the end
[1:43:00] time message what Christ is we are not
[1:43:04] we will be we are he said in that day
[1:43:07] you shall know that what the father it
[1:43:09] says the the unity that was between the
[1:43:12] father and the son you will know the
[1:43:14] same way that the father was in the Son
[1:43:16] and the son in the father you will know
[1:43:18] that I am in you and you in I
[1:43:21] the unity of the father and his
[1:43:27] worshippers but one
[1:43:29] them he talks and he
[1:43:34] said he makes the statement in the
[1:43:37] message the UN and if you know where my
[1:43:40] inspiration came from but B preach a
[1:43:43] message called in the unfailing reality
[1:43:47] of the Living God he said in the days of
[1:43:51] Jesus of
[1:43:54] Nazareth when he was on here on Earth
[1:43:57] Walking In the Flesh he found that
[1:44:00] people in the in that in his day seeking
[1:44:03] a religion that would bring them
[1:44:07] Deliverance now I I don't want you to
[1:44:09] take this word religion as a covering
[1:44:12] but it it means the body of what could
[1:44:14] be done what what and as I read you'll
[1:44:17] know and it says and Christianity meets
[1:44:20] every
[1:44:21] challenge that they had asked
[1:44:23] Christianity meets every Challenge and
[1:44:26] this is paragraph 60 if you're looking
[1:44:28] for it Christianity he says meets every
[1:44:31] challenge that they needed and
[1:44:34] everything that they ask
[1:44:37] for it says it challenge everyone that
[1:44:41] everyone that they need every everyone
[1:44:44] of their needs but they wouldn't receive
[1:44:46] it so here here is what I with my
[1:44:51] thought as I begin with it say we we the
[1:44:54] the the religion the word of
[1:44:56] God it came to answer to the needs that
[1:45:00] men had it it wasn't s for us to just
[1:45:04] say this is the word of God we'll try to
[1:45:07] obey it the way
[1:45:09] I with our best ability and everything
[1:45:12] no when the word is said is to fulfill
[1:45:15] or accomplish a certain purpose it's
[1:45:17] it's to take you and to bring you to a
[1:45:20] certain destination so when when we we
[1:45:24] understand by the sins of Adam we find
[1:45:26] ourselves in the situation that we are
[1:45:28] in it's God doesn't condemn you for
[1:45:31] being a
[1:45:31] sinner we are Sinner by the birth that
[1:45:34] we came by but it says God condemns you
[1:45:37] for refusing to accept his provided way
[1:45:41] what is his provided way is his word
[1:45:43] that is given to you so if we come here
[1:45:46] this morning and we have challenges we
[1:45:49] have desires we have lacking or we have
[1:45:52] things that we cannot do God doesn't
[1:45:54] condemn you for coming that way but he
[1:45:57] condemns you when he's provided a way of
[1:45:59] Escape you're not taking
[1:46:03] it and I like that because he's not a
[1:46:07] god who's after punishing you he a god
[1:46:09] who's after saving you helping you
[1:46:12] getting you out of your mess helping you
[1:46:14] from your situation so it says he
[1:46:17] constantly he's bringing is not to bring
[1:46:20] us condemnation but it's to try to bring
[1:46:23] us out of what we are in into the things
[1:46:26] that he wants to
[1:46:28] do the word of God is here to deliver us
[1:46:33] to heal us to save us so if you can you
[1:46:37] have one of those things God is here to
[1:46:39] do that and that's why I I I said this
[1:46:42] morning that we desire that reality to
[1:46:45] become more and more because the devil
[1:46:49] is after trying to make as church
[1:46:53] members a church member is one who he
[1:46:57] stands just a step away from whatever
[1:47:00] the reality reality is so he will come
[1:47:04] he will accept and he will say oh I
[1:47:06] believe God is here to save me I believe
[1:47:08] the word can do that I believe I believe
[1:47:11] but yet there's something that stops him
[1:47:13] and the word to become
[1:47:18] one I believe God can save but not just
[1:47:21] me no no I have done too much for the
[1:47:24] word to save
[1:47:25] me I believe God can heal yeah but mine
[1:47:29] I got it from my parents is it runs in
[1:47:31] the
[1:47:32] family this one is
[1:47:35] different and I'm speaking to us this
[1:47:39] morning it or you get into a condition
[1:47:43] where you read your Bible and there's a
[1:47:46] promise you say well I believe it I'll
[1:47:48] just wait until God wants to do do
[1:47:54] it all of those are the tricks of the
[1:47:57] enemy to stop you from getting the
[1:48:02] promise all of those things are excuses
[1:48:05] that the enemy is putting in your way so
[1:48:08] you don't get to the promise a real
[1:48:11] believer when God has said something oh
[1:48:14] but whatam talks about a man he said oh
[1:48:16] they came they went to the hospital and
[1:48:19] and and then they told the child that he
[1:48:21] was going to die they gave them a final
[1:48:23] they said there's nothing we can do
[1:48:25] they're going to die that's a complete
[1:48:26] death sentence there's nothing we can do
[1:48:29] and then he says the grandfather came to
[1:48:31] the meetings and he heard me talk about
[1:48:33] the Living God and the things that he
[1:48:35] could do he said he went into his closet
[1:48:39] he said I'll not get out of this closet
[1:48:41] until God speaks to
[1:48:44] me and when he got out he told them the
[1:48:47] child shall
[1:48:48] live they said how could could you speak
[1:48:50] that way he says God told me the child
[1:48:53] will live and the Child live that's the
[1:48:55] kind of reality we're looking for people
[1:48:58] that can grab on to the word of God and
[1:49:01] press on until it becomes a
[1:49:04] reality not a passive aggressive or just
[1:49:09] some P passive believing and no people
[1:49:12] that wants to see God people that are
[1:49:15] looking for him people that are
[1:49:17] hungering you said there's going to come
[1:49:19] a rapture we're going to call the
[1:49:21] Rapture to come down
[1:49:24] Hallelujah the prophet said God is
[1:49:26] waiting on you and I he didn't say God
[1:49:28] has anything else to do he's waiting
[1:49:30] upon you and I if we still satisfy with
[1:49:34] the things of the world how do we call
[1:49:37] the Rapture
[1:49:39] downl if we still like our jobs if we
[1:49:43] still like our houses if we're still
[1:49:45] satisfied with the thing that we have
[1:49:47] how is God going to call the Rapture no
[1:49:50] wonder God has to come and take
[1:49:51] everything away from us before we can
[1:49:53] call
[1:50:00] out we as Believers of this message we
[1:50:04] have to constantly Place ourselves in a
[1:50:07] position where I don't care if if God
[1:50:12] blesses us with a natural thing let not
[1:50:14] your affection for the promises be taken
[1:50:18] away by the things you have
[1:50:21] if that is happening do like the Rich
[1:50:23] Young Ruler was asked set it
[1:50:27] all if if your job if if whatever you
[1:50:31] are in is taking you away from the
[1:50:34] affection from the crying out for
[1:50:36] Rapture from the crying out to the body
[1:50:39] change take it away ask God to change it
[1:50:42] for
[1:50:45] you because remember he says it's only
[1:50:48] for those that hung and thirst for his
[1:50:53] righteousness no not those that would do
[1:50:57] work on the things of the world and say
[1:50:59] well has he come yet no okay I'll
[1:51:01] continue a little bit I still have more
[1:51:03] time is he done oh no no no no nothing
[1:51:05] has happened okay is Israel still there
[1:51:07] okay okay good good is America still
[1:51:10] supporting Israel okay okay we're
[1:51:13] good is California sink yet no okay
[1:51:16] we're still
[1:51:17] good we do that we do
[1:51:23] that the prophet said it was not
[1:51:26] governing forces that moved the bride no
[1:51:30] if the governing forces the event will
[1:51:33] move the the the the organized churches
[1:51:36] the bride is moved up by the power of
[1:51:39] God by the word of the Living God why
[1:51:42] because something within the heart when
[1:51:44] they hear the word they want to see the
[1:51:46] word
[1:51:47] manifested I don't know how many times I
[1:51:50] can say it it burns within my heart I
[1:51:52] want to see the word
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:58] amen God becoming a reality in the lives
[1:52:03] of his
[1:52:04] children he says when there something
[1:52:07] come up we go back to our knees we say
[1:52:10] God you have given us as your children
[1:52:14] to stand here in this end time to be the
[1:52:17] very manifestation and representation of
[1:52:19] Who You Are are we are standing here for
[1:52:22] our brother we are standing here for our
[1:52:24] sister our brother Tommy has a sister
[1:52:27] who is Shen they've given her a death
[1:52:29] sentence Lord we stand here as the
[1:52:31] Church of the Living God we say let life
[1:52:34] come back into that body according to
[1:52:36] Thy word where people that hunger to see
[1:52:42] God the moment we go out our mind is
[1:52:45] full of the things that we have to do
[1:52:48] you got to do this you got to go
[1:52:49] shopping we to do this don't forget to
[1:52:50] pay the
[1:52:52] bills and then the only time there's a
[1:52:55] little bit of space created is when we
[1:52:57] walk into the
[1:52:59] church and when we walk in we only have
[1:53:02] 15 minutes of attention before we start
[1:53:05] thinking about
[1:53:06] tomorrow we think about our job on
[1:53:10] Sunday like before Monday has come
[1:53:12] everybody's already planning oh first
[1:53:15] hour we're going to do this second hour
[1:53:16] I got this meeting we're going to go
[1:53:17] here we're going to do this
[1:53:20] is that really Rapture
[1:53:22] condition is that Rapture
[1:53:27] Ready and I hope this is not
[1:53:30] condemnation I hope this is trying
[1:53:32] to as the scripture will say I'm here it
[1:53:36] says that I may take that we may just
[1:53:38] take our minds and and take it and and
[1:53:41] bring awareness of the promises of God
[1:53:44] for the end
[1:53:45] time we live for our go we live for God
[1:53:48] and not for our job and the things of
[1:53:50] the world the our priority is the word
[1:53:53] of God what the word of God said is what
[1:53:55] we'll
[1:53:56] do now let me just jump and I I
[1:54:02] didn't but what I'm talks about MDC
[1:54:06] and I thought initially I was going to
[1:54:09] call this experience the coming to
[1:54:13] experience with MDC now Y is Abraham
[1:54:16] butam said but when he talks about MDC
[1:54:19] I'll just summarize it if if those of
[1:54:22] you that don't know please I'm sorry I
[1:54:23] just I I don't I wouldn't have time to
[1:54:26] go through it all now when he speaks
[1:54:28] about this MDC he said he had no father
[1:54:31] no mother no beginning of time he had no
[1:54:35] offsprings to where you can say he came
[1:54:37] from year as his children he came from
[1:54:39] nowhere we don't even know he said he
[1:54:42] must be an eternal
[1:54:46] being now the scripture says Abraham is
[1:54:49] return R turning from the
[1:54:51] battles there he is after suffering
[1:54:54] after going through all kinds of stuff
[1:54:57] after going to fight for his brother and
[1:54:59] everything he finally gets an audience
[1:55:01] with this person after fighting the case
[1:55:04] of life after fighting against all the
[1:55:07] things of the enemy after fighting the
[1:55:09] devil you get audience with MDC he comes
[1:55:13] and he gives him Bread and Wine to
[1:55:14] strengthen him and but bam said if you
[1:55:17] go read that message he said that this
[1:55:20] guy this MDC he says he was a
[1:55:25] person the person who was he he was the
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] word he was not a thought he was not a
[1:55:35] thought we all was a thought but the
[1:55:38] thought moved into the logos which was
[1:55:41] the word what is the word the word is
[1:55:43] the thought being expressed it was an
[1:55:46] expression of something when he came to
[1:55:49] Abraham he was the only one who knew
[1:55:52] what the life of Abraham was to be at
[1:55:54] the
[1:55:55] end let me say this my brother my sister
[1:55:58] there's only one who knows something
[1:56:00] about your life and that's the same
[1:56:05] one
[1:56:07] amen don't look for anybody else to tell
[1:56:10] you about your life find the same MDC he
[1:56:13] says the same MDC turned out to be Jesus
[1:56:16] Christ and in the end time the same MDC
[1:56:18] came
[1:56:20] yes but whatam says when he stood there
[1:56:24] this m and this is just me paraphrasing
[1:56:27] he was the only one who actually had the
[1:56:31] original mind of what you were supposed
[1:56:34] to be in the
[1:56:38] beginning what I'm said he had the
[1:56:42] secret of our journey and life and death
[1:56:47] and life after he knew are all of it so
[1:56:51] yeah you are you are born in sin and
[1:56:53] confusion and everything there's someone
[1:56:55] standing in front of you say you were
[1:56:58] predestinated to be in the mind of God
[1:57:00] in the beginning you don't even know it
[1:57:03] because you bypass your theophany you
[1:57:05] were in the mind of God over there he
[1:57:08] created you yes you came from sin but he
[1:57:11] knew that when I spoke my word you will
[1:57:14] understand it you will hear the word and
[1:57:16] it will change your life amen that's the
[1:57:20] person you want to meet that's the
[1:57:22] author of this Bible that's not a me
[1:57:25] that's a person is a
[1:57:27] reality hallelujah
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:31] hallelujah now God spoke to Abraham many
[1:57:34] other ways but his life his body was not
[1:57:39] changed until he met the person of the
[1:57:41] word
[1:57:46] himself we look for changes where
[1:57:48] there's no change
[1:57:50] all
[1:57:52] right but said those old chisan it says
[1:57:56] they brought the kingdom of God down
[1:57:59] they brought the process they brought
[1:58:01] the promises of God down if God spoke
[1:58:04] something they they would St their lives
[1:58:07] until it come to
[1:58:10] pass are we doing the same
[1:58:14] thing he stood there and he looks at
[1:58:18] Abraham
[1:58:21] why did Sarah
[1:58:25] laugh he knew
[1:58:27] that Sarah was behind the
[1:58:30] tent even as it
[1:58:33] said I will come again and Sarah will
[1:58:36] have a
[1:58:37] child now remember the problem was not
[1:58:40] them for them to go young because they
[1:58:41] were young and they didn't have any
[1:58:43] children but
[1:58:45] somehow the presence of mezc was to
[1:58:48] inject life into
[1:58:52] them so it's not just to change your
[1:58:54] body but it was importing life the
[1:58:57] purpose of this mzc at the end time
[1:59:01] remember when the messenger talks about
[1:59:03] the church ages it says the prophet was
[1:59:06] at the beginning but in between it was a
[1:59:08] bunch of reformers and only a prophet
[1:59:11] came to the end time and the prophet
[1:59:13] will tell you that the word of God only
[1:59:15] comes through the prophet so at the end
[1:59:18] time God needs to reject his own life so
[1:59:21] he can get the result that he's looking
[1:59:23] for but how can you get the result until
[1:59:25] you meet the same
[1:59:30] m in the day of Jesus Christ he looked
[1:59:32] at him he says when Abraham saw my day
[1:59:36] he rejoiced they looked at him and said
[1:59:38] you're not even
[1:59:41] 50 but they failed to realize that he
[1:59:45] was not caught in time he was an eternal
[1:59:47] being he was was the very manifestation
[1:59:50] of the thoughts of God in the beginning
[1:59:52] my brother my sister let's get into the
[1:59:54] thoughts of God that will manifested of
[1:59:56] us let's not be the people that are
[1:59:58] caught in sin today and sin tomorrow or
[2:00:01] let be let's get out of that stuff and
[2:00:04] the only way to get out of that stuff is
[2:00:05] to be MDC
[2:00:10] himself the author of The
[2:00:13] Bible the one who started it all the
[2:00:16] creator of all things he came from
[2:00:19] eternity he took a body he took of the
[2:00:22] 16 elements he made himself a flesh he
[2:00:25] came but one them says this being is
[2:00:28] misunderstood and then the question to
[2:00:30] you is why do we have to know about
[2:00:35] him why because he's the only one who
[2:00:39] can impart
[2:00:40] life he's the only one who knows the
[2:00:44] secret about of Life of your life it was
[2:00:47] hidden to yourself but it came here and
[2:00:49] reveal it with the opening of The Seven
[2:00:52] Seals not only that the same one said
[2:00:55] that the Seed of Abraham will experience
[2:00:59] the same thing that their father
[2:01:00] experienced when he when he met his
[2:01:03] father Our Father Abraham he says I'm
[2:01:05] doing this so that your seed when they
[2:01:07] come forth they will meet the same
[2:01:10] person they won't recognize it by his
[2:01:12] flesh because remember he changed flesh
[2:01:15] in the days of Jesus he changed flesh in
[2:01:17] the end time but when they will hear the
[2:01:19] same word they will know that's him
[2:01:22] speaking my sheep know my voice another
[2:01:25] they will not follow that's why I want
[2:01:27] to say this message is not for everybody
[2:01:30] but if God has opened your eyes to hear
[2:01:33] us to see him I want a
[2:01:36] s I want his life to be my
[2:01:40] life don't give me
[2:01:43] intellect it's a now let me say this
[2:01:45] because I think we take it wrong when we
[2:01:47] say intellect I think it's it's
[2:01:49] important to know the scripture it's
[2:01:50] commendable because when God does he
[2:01:53] will he will speak to you by his word so
[2:01:55] you have to know what his word said but
[2:01:58] that's not enough to know his word but
[2:02:01] whatam says I know the author that's
[2:02:03] what matters so if you don't know the
[2:02:06] word let him let him Express his word to
[2:02:08] you go read it that's fine but after you
[2:02:10] read it let the person of that
[2:02:13] word become a reality to you if the
[2:02:16] musician could come this morning
[2:02:23] the reality of the Living God butam says
[2:02:27] the the devil will try to make you a
[2:02:29] church member yeah pay your ties do this
[2:02:32] he says that's wonderful but he will try
[2:02:35] to come you'll come to church and and
[2:02:37] you'll sit there pay attention who sang
[2:02:40] in the wrong key who sang a special who
[2:02:43] did what and all of that who who dress
[2:02:45] up with what clothes and who did what
[2:02:47] and they will keep you that way way but
[2:02:50] God is here the holy spirit is here to
[2:02:53] put you in contact with melc
[2:03:00] himself it's like I heard I believe I
[2:03:03] heard it from our pastor he said you
[2:03:05] what you have the right to say this
[2:03:07] morning that whoever wrote the Bible I
[2:03:11] want to meet the man
[2:03:13] himself I'm tired of somebody telling me
[2:03:15] about this
[2:03:17] man I have the right to conference with
[2:03:20] God himself and I declare to you this
[2:03:23] morning you have the right to call upon
[2:03:25] his name and say you wrote your word I
[2:03:28] heard it but I want to see you for
[2:03:30] myself not for the pastor not for
[2:03:33] somebody else not for my parent but my
[2:03:36] myself I want to know you the same way
[2:03:39] they know
[2:03:40] you I'm not satisfied with anything
[2:03:43] short and if anybody doesn't have it I
[2:03:45] want to be the first to have
[2:03:47] it
[2:03:50] don't sell yourself
[2:03:52] short don't let's not reason in the
[2:03:56] realm of what has been he's here to do
[2:03:59] something new he's here to do according
[2:04:02] to his
[2:04:03] word we come and if we're not careful we
[2:04:07] become whatever the other does we have
[2:04:10] limitation so you can only do up to here
[2:04:12] if you do here you become a
[2:04:15] fanatic what's wrong with us
[2:04:19] let God manifest himself the way he
[2:04:22] wants to manifest all I care is his word
[2:04:25] to be manifest to me I want the reality
[2:04:28] of what he wrote here to be my reality
[2:04:32] the bride and the bridegroom are one how
[2:04:35] are they becoming one the
[2:04:38] bridegroom is here revealing himself in
[2:04:40] the form of his bride amen that's the
[2:04:43] end time prophecy God bless you let's
[2:04:45] all
[2:04:47] stand
[2:04:53] let's just bow our
[2:04:55] heads sorry I I just lost my voice I
[2:04:58] just can't go on we'll probably pick on
[2:05:01] this another
[2:05:05] time but I hope you can hear my heart
[2:05:07] this
[2:05:11] morning I just
[2:05:13] think this the devil has so many tricks
[2:05:17] so many ways and so many
[2:05:21] exits you know we can say those that
[2:05:25] don't have the message yeah we can
[2:05:27] understand you know they've been caught
[2:05:30] up in the
[2:05:31] denomination that's why they do what
[2:05:33] they do and
[2:05:34] everything but we have had the
[2:05:37] opportunity for our eyes to be
[2:05:40] open but the same devil is also around
[2:05:43] here trying to to create a different
[2:05:47] narrative about the word of
[2:05:50] God you know where it becomes and if
[2:05:53] we're not careful and you know people
[2:05:55] start to fall away and people start to
[2:05:58] do things that are ungodly and
[2:06:00] everything and and we saw well he was
[2:06:03] not saved oh that this is no that's not
[2:06:05] what we are looking for we want the
[2:06:08] reality of God to be manifested from the
[2:06:10] children to the
[2:06:12] grown-ups we want to be in the economy
[2:06:14] of God and there's only one that can do
[2:06:16] it and that's God himself am Alo
[2:06:20] therefore when we preach the gospel our
[2:06:22] desire is so you can come in contact
[2:06:25] with MDC
[2:06:27] himself that he can change your life he
[2:06:31] can bring his reality to you so you can
[2:06:34] never be the same but what I'm says the
[2:06:36] holy spirit is not there to heal to your
[2:06:41] desires the holy spirit is there to kill
[2:06:44] all of your desires and bring forth
[2:06:46] God's desire in you
[2:06:49] it will cause you to walk away from the
[2:06:51] things of the world it will cause you to
[2:06:54] no longer desire when you do the things
[2:06:57] which are unpleasing to Heart your heart
[2:06:59] cry out and say God I don't want to do
[2:07:01] this
[2:07:03] am at one place I didn't read it but
[2:07:06] I'll just say it he says people get
[2:07:09] enough holy spirit so they just don't
[2:07:11] lie they don't steal you know they just
[2:07:14] know make sure I don't want to go to
[2:07:16] hell that's not enough it says God wants
[2:07:18] to fill every fiber of your being and I
[2:07:21] say God fill me up this
[2:07:23] morning let me not just be satisfied
[2:07:26] with this measure where because I'm not
[2:07:28] lying that means I'm good no I want
[2:07:31] enough holy spirit that I can defeat the
[2:07:34] army of the devil that I can stand up
[2:07:37] for my brother that I when there's a
[2:07:39] problem I can stand there and God can be
[2:07:42] manifested in
[2:07:44] me enough Holy Spirit to stand in the
[2:07:47] position you have given given
[2:07:50] me not enough to just be satisfied oh
[2:07:53] I'm a Christian praise God

[2:08:15] Spirit to care for the one who doesn't
[2:08:18] see who doesn't
[2:08:20] understand not to look one another with
[2:08:23] the eye of what does he think who is he

[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:46] God I don't I don't want to just run out
[2:13:50] of
[2:13:51] here and this just be another
[2:13:55] service just just another Duty
[2:14:00] another couple hours in a
[2:14:03] day do you know that
[2:14:07] reality it's too cold out there to stand
[2:14:10] out in the parking lot and have
[2:14:11] Fellowship maybe just spend a little few
[2:14:13] more
[2:14:14] moments
[2:14:16] here and why don't you you ask yourself
[2:14:19] do I do I really have the reality of the
[2:14:23] Living God in my
[2:14:25] life the reality of his
[2:14:28] presence you know his brother Billy was
[2:14:31] ministering he started to talk about the
[2:14:33] woman at the well in the formula and how
[2:14:36] how how how are you going to draw water
[2:14:38] how are you going to do this
[2:14:40] how he was speaking of a living water
[2:14:42] and I I I got to thinking you know
[2:14:45] that's that's what we we we so many
[2:14:48] times we start to think of the formula
[2:14:49] and we're like well I got to have a
[2:14:51] bucket and I got to have a rope and I
[2:14:53] got to do all these things if I'm going
[2:14:54] to have this living water if I'm going
[2:14:56] to get the revelation of the of the
[2:14:57] message then do I got the do I got the
[2:15:00] right tools do I got all the right
[2:15:01] things to what is this living water he's
[2:15:03] talking about I I got to get myself
[2:15:05] already ready and do all these
[2:15:07] things no it it wasn't about what she
[2:15:10] had wasn't about her ability to draw the
[2:15:14] water but as he started to discern the
[2:15:16] thoughts and intents of her heart go get
[2:15:19] your husband in other words I know your
[2:15:22] life I know the secret of your journey I
[2:15:25] know what you've been through I know you
[2:15:28] you've had mistakes in your past and
[2:15:30] you've fallen down so many times and you
[2:15:34] feel like you can never be restored I
[2:15:35] know about all those things and once he
[2:15:39] started to discern the thoughts and
[2:15:40] intents of her
[2:15:43] heart then that's when she didn't need
[2:15:46] her bucket she didn't need her rope she
[2:15:49] didn't need any of those things all she
[2:15:51] needed was him I was thinking as he
[2:15:54] ministered about Abraham and Sarah you
[2:15:56] know Sarah laughed in her
[2:15:58] heart why was Sarah laughing her she
[2:16:01] didn't have a revelation or an
[2:16:03] understanding of who that
[2:16:04] was a really who that was that was
[2:16:07] standing there that was
[2:16:09] speaking I say I I want a revelation of
[2:16:12] who this mzc
[2:16:16] is we we need a greater Revelation and
[2:16:19] understanding of what has been delivered
[2:16:21] to us or we're just back to intellect
[2:16:24] we're just trying to figure this out
[2:16:26] we're just trying to put the pieces
[2:16:28] together but as brother Billy said what
[2:16:31] what was he there to do he was there to
[2:16:33] inject
[2:16:34] life the
[2:16:36] reality a change there was there was
[2:16:39] something there that God had come to do
[2:16:41] and say Lord I I want to know what what
[2:16:43] you're here to do
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:46] Lord I want that reality I want that
[2:16:49] power in my life Lord Jesus I don't just
[2:16:52] want to run out the door and not be
[2:16:56] changed I want to be changed I want to
[2:16:59] be changed I want to know him in the
[2:17:02] power of his resurrection and as we T
[2:17:04] and sing a few more songs ask yourself
[2:17:07] is is that reality
[2:17:12] there he said Abraham
[2:17:15] rejoiced to see my
[2:17:18] he are you
[2:17:20] [Music]
[2:17:22] rejoicing he said before Abraham was I
[2:17:29] am where are we standing in the
[2:17:33] presence of the I am let him discern the
[2:17:37] thought and intent of your
[2:17:39] heart let that word become a reality and
[2:17:42] I just wanted to labor for a moment as
[2:17:44] brother Billy offered for those that
[2:17:46] need prayer if you need prayer
[2:17:48] if you need a reality if you need
[2:17:51] something to break the scripture says
[2:17:52] and Sarah by faith receive
[2:17:58] strength to conceive
[2:18:01] seed that's what we
[2:18:04] need Lord May our faith rise up to
[2:18:06] another level this morning Lord Lord may
[2:18:09] may may by faith we re receive strength
[2:18:12] to conceive this word your presence has
[2:18:14] come amongst us you are here Jesus
[2:18:17] Christ is here to impart life to
[2:18:19] you we're in his presence the reality of
[2:18:24] a living God is right here but are we
[2:18:26] like Sarah not realizing who it is
[2:18:27] really that's standing here this morning
[2:18:30] are we missing something I ask are we
[2:18:32] missing
[2:18:34] something where we're so quick to run
[2:18:36] back into the week and just go through
[2:18:38] the routine just just another good
