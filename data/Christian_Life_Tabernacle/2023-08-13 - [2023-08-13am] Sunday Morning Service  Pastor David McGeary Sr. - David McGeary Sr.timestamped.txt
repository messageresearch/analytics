[13:20] Jesus again
[13:24] [Music]
[13:26] go ahead and bow our heads just commit
[13:28] the service unto the Lord
[13:31] Heavenly Father Lord we love you this
[13:33] morning and once again just so grateful
[13:36] for the opportunity to come together
[13:38] Lord to learn of you to worship you to
[13:41] lift up your name Lord the world pulls
[13:44] Us in so many directions and requires so
[13:47] much of us
[13:48] the Lord to have a place and a time set
[13:50] aside that we can set all that apart
[13:53] Lord and to come into your presence and
[13:55] to welcome you
[13:56] and Lord I pray that Lord as your word
[13:59] is said that where two or three are
[14:01] gathered in your name Lord you've called
[14:03] us by your name
[14:05] Lord Jesus and as we come in that door
[14:07] there's Lord all kinds of needs
[14:09] questions burdens third things that we
[14:12] have in our heart
[14:14] Lord You're the answer to everyone
[14:16] Lord and you promised you're the need
[14:18] meter
[14:19] you're the burden Bearer father you're
[14:21] the Healer
[14:22] Lord You're the deliverer Lord You're
[14:24] the lifter of every burden and father we
[14:26] just commit the service to you that your
[14:29] word would have preeminence Lord that
[14:31] you would Lord take control of every
[14:34] spirit that would seek to hinder the
[14:35] moving of your hand and the delivery of
[14:37] your word Lord that you would be lifted
[14:40] up and glorified in our midst Lord that
[14:43] this would not be about a man or the
[14:45] works of men but father that you would
[14:47] Lord just when we all leave here we
[14:50] could say that the hand of God was
[14:52] clearly seen among us we pray we commit
[14:55] this service to you once again we thank
[14:56] you in Jesus name amen
[15:00] amen
[15:01] maybe seated take a load off your feet
[15:04] for a minute
[15:06] you know we have a tendency when we
[15:09] I don't want you but when we look at the
[15:11] scriptures we have a tendency to look at
[15:14] some of the Great characters of the
[15:17] Bible
[15:19] and make them superhuman in our minds
[15:23] you know we read of their great works
[15:27] they're great victories
[15:29] how the Lord spoke to them in such
[15:31] Mighty ways and
[15:33] maybe found themselves in Hebrews 11 as
[15:36] a hero of faith
[15:39] but we make them something greater than
[15:41] what we are
[15:44] right we make them Larger than Life
[15:46] you know so much greater
[15:49] so much stronger
[15:52] so much more useful
[15:55] you know and if we're not careful
[15:57] we can let the enemy Rob us of our
[16:00] potential
[16:03] because
[16:04] we make the examples that the word gives
[16:07] us
[16:09] something that is beyond us
[16:11] something we can't reach
[16:15] you know what's so wonderful about the
[16:16] songs
[16:18] is it gives us
[16:20] kind of an up close and personal
[16:24] intimate look
[16:27] at the struggles of one of these Great
[16:28] Men
[16:32] in these scriptures we can see what it
[16:34] was really like for David
[16:37] a man who is after God's Own Heart
[16:41] has he struggled day in and day out
[16:45] the one who slew Giants
[16:48] the one who defeated Kings
[16:51] the one who ruled Nations
[16:53] and yet you can see that he was just
[16:55] like the rest of us
[16:59] you know we read last week that David
[17:02] got to a place where he was so exhausted
[17:05] so worn down
[17:07] by just all the trivial things of Life
[17:10] the things that just don't matter
[17:14] and he got to such a place where he
[17:16] found himself wondering if God hated him
[17:20] even though he was a man after God's Own
[17:22] Heart
[17:24] you know the enemy uses those same
[17:25] tactics
[17:28] on the rest of us
[17:31] you know and he saw himself in a place
[17:33] where he needed to lay hold of the same
[17:35] one that we need to lay hold of
[17:37] in those times of exhaustion
[17:41] you know it helps us realize that David
[17:43] was just like us he had the same mind
[17:46] battles that we do
[17:49] the same kinds of daily struggles he was
[17:52] just human dependent on the Lord just
[17:54] like the rest of us there's no such
[17:56] thing as superhumans and little humans
[17:59] there's just regular men and women
[18:03] struggling through life trying to lay
[18:05] hold of the Lord
[18:06] that's what I appreciate about the song
[18:10] you know in Psalm 13
[18:12] which we'll read this morning David is
[18:14] once again
[18:16] in a place where he's in need of God
[18:21] you know it's just a short song but you
[18:24] know as we read this we'll be reading
[18:27] statements that could just as easily
[18:29] come from any one of our own lips
[18:32] Maybe
[18:34] it was even something we prayed this
[18:37] morning
[18:40] in verse one how long will you forget me
[18:44] O Lord
[18:46] how long will you hide your face from me
[18:50] verse 2 is my enemy that thing which
[18:53] comes against me how long will he have
[18:56] victory over me
[19:00] but you know as we read this there's a
[19:02] statement here that David makes as he's
[19:04] crying out to the Lord which
[19:07] you don't want to take a look at and
[19:09] again it really doesn't matter what he
[19:11] was struggling with in this hour
[19:14] one day all those things were long
[19:16] forgotten
[19:18] amen
[19:21] but notice in his prayer
[19:24] what he asks for in verse 3.
[19:28] he says consider and hear me o my O Lord
[19:31] my God
[19:33] lighten mine eyes
[19:36] lest I sleep the sleep of death
[19:40] in the middle of his circumstance
[19:43] his cry was
[19:45] light in mine eyes
[19:47] enlighten me
[19:49] cause me to see
[19:53] you know that caught my attention
[19:54] because
[19:56] you know here's this man after God's Own
[19:59] Heart praying in his time of need and
[20:00] he's not asking for
[20:02] relief
[20:04] he's not asking for healing
[20:07] he's not asking for deliverance
[20:10] he's asking for
[20:13] sight
[20:15] he's asking the desires would be
[20:17] lightened
[20:19] he asked for revelation
[20:22] Lord enlighten me
[20:24] help me to see
[20:27] open my eyes
[20:30] you know it caused me to wonder how many
[20:32] times
[20:34] I look at my problem and I pray that God
[20:37] would deliver me from my problem
[20:40] but how many times do I ask him to open
[20:43] my eyes
[20:46] and reminded of that prophet in the Old
[20:48] Testament who had a servant who in an
[20:51] hour of great trial
[20:53] was in desperation
[20:55] and the prophet said open his eyes
[20:57] that he can see the rest of the story
[21:04] help me to see what you're doing helped
[21:07] me to see as you see
[21:10] give me thus saith the Lord
[21:13] you know brother Branham said in the
[21:15] church ages book that the importance of
[21:17] Revelation
[21:19] cannot be overemphasized
[21:23] he said it's more important than
[21:25] perhaps we realize he said if you could
[21:28] pray for anything
[21:30] pray for revelation
[21:33] Enlighten my eyes
[21:35] that I may see
[21:39] David said in Psalm 119 Verse 18 open
[21:43] thou mine eyes
[21:45] light my eyes
[21:47] that I may behold wondrous things out of
[21:50] thy law you know this isn't just about
[21:52] seeing great scriptural truths of the
[21:54] age
[21:57] show me my circumstance according to
[22:00] your word
[22:01] where I am today
[22:05] nobody can teach you that from a Pulpit
[22:10] only God can do that if we'll ask
[22:15] the question is is do we ask
[22:19] you know I know my first reaction is to
[22:22] to a problem is to take it away
[22:26] but the scriptures show time and again
[22:29] those asking open my eyes
[22:35] David said in Psalm 18 28 for thou Wilt
[22:38] light my candle
[22:40] the Lord my God will Enlighten my
[22:43] darkness
[22:45] you know again this is more than just
[22:47] being able to see him in a dark age this
[22:50] is about him me as an individual seeing
[22:53] him in my dark hour
[22:57] this is about being quickened by his
[22:59] word in our daily circumstance
[23:04] that's the daily lamp to our feet that
[23:06] the scriptures speak about also in Psalm
[23:08] 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[23:13] and a light onto my path
[23:18] he said in Psalm 27 11 teach me thy way
[23:22] O Lord
[23:25] lead me in a plain path not a hidden one
[23:30] that I can clearly see
[23:34] lighten mine eyes oh Lord did you know
[23:37] it's a word promise
[23:39] that he opens
[23:41] eyes that he reveals
[23:44] secrets that he shines a light if we
[23:48] will but ask
[23:51] you know we all know First Corinthians 2
[23:54] 9.
[23:55] it says I hath not seen
[23:58] Nor Ear heard
[24:01] neither have entered into the heart of
[24:03] man the things which God hath prepared
[24:06] for them that love him
[24:08] but you know the problem is is we stop
[24:10] right there
[24:12] we make that our promise
[24:16] we're satisfied with that and we call it
[24:19] faith I believe that the Lord has good
[24:21] things for me
[24:23] and I'm trusting in that
[24:27] but that's only half the promise
[24:29] if you keep reading
[24:32] it says in verse 10 but God hath
[24:35] revealed them
[24:37] unto us by his spirit
[24:40] for the spirit searcheth all things
[24:44] yea the Deep things of God
[24:48] that's the promise
[24:50] that he hath revealed them
[24:53] if if we would but ask
[24:57] you know you can keep on reading in
[24:59] First Corinthians 2.
[25:01] it's just a wonderful chapter
[25:03] he says for what man knoweth the things
[25:06] of man save the spirit of man which is
[25:08] in him
[25:09] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[25:14] but the spirit of God
[25:17] now we have received the spirit we have
[25:21] received not the spirit of the world but
[25:23] the spirit which is of god that we might
[25:26] know
[25:28] the things that are freely given of us
[25:31] by God
[25:34] for who hath known the mind of the Lord
[25:36] that he may instruct him but we have
[25:39] the mind of the Lord
[25:40] Enlighten my eyes
[25:42] open my eyes cause me to see
[25:47] nothing is out of control
[25:49] everything is happening according to
[25:51] plan
[25:53] open my eyes
[25:54] let me see lighten mine eyes
[25:58] if we will but ask let's go ahead and
[26:00] stand
[26:02] there's a promise that we can be shown
[26:05] and we can see thus saith the Lord
[26:09] in our
[26:11] day this day
[26:16] where I am today and will but ask as
[26:18] David does in Psalm 13. pray for
[26:21] revelation
[26:23] it's the most important thing to see as
[26:26] he sees to see by his word to have our
[26:30] path lightened by that lamp
[26:34] not just Mysteries of the age
[26:37] but to see in the darkness of my hour
[26:39] now
[26:40] let's just go ahead and read that little
[26:42] Psalm Psalm 13 this morning light in
[26:46] mine eyes
[26:47] let's start in verse one how long will
[26:49] thou Forget Me O Lord forever how long
[26:52] will thou hide thy face from me how long
[26:55] shall I take counsel in my soul having
[26:57] sorrow in my heart daily how long shall
[27:00] mine enemy be exalted over me consider
[27:03] and hear me O Lord my God lighten mine
[27:06] eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death
[27:09] lest might enemies say I have prevailed
[27:11] against him and those that trouble me
[27:14] rejoice when I am moved but I have
[27:16] trusted in thy mercy my heart shall
[27:19] rejoice in thy salvation I will sing
[27:22] unto the Lord because he hath dealt
[27:24] bountifully with me amen
[27:31] amen God bless you you can turn around
[27:33] and shook a hand of somebody tell them
[27:35] good morning God bless you amen

[44:51] he's always the same it's a matter of
[44:54] our attitude and how we approach the
[44:56] word if we go if it reverence if we give
[44:59] it humility if we humble ourselves to
[45:01] the word and accept it really in our
[45:03] heart he really will Deliver Us amen and
[45:06] we have a testimony here that justifies
[45:09] of that sister Gail Singh is saying here
[45:12] she says God has begun to answer the
[45:14] unspoken prayer request for multiple
[45:16] people the Saints have prayed for
[45:20] one of which was my daughter-in-law
[45:23] whose body was rejecting all treatments
[45:25] for her cancer
[45:28] says she got bad side effects this
[45:30] treatment was stopped three weeks ago
[45:32] but tests showed yesterday that there
[45:34] were good news
[45:36] today they're able to resume the chemo
[45:38] treatment I believe prayer of the Saints
[45:41] was answered
[45:42] also my severe pains have disappeared by
[45:45] God's healing Grace
[45:47] I walked and felt much better
[45:50] and and so much that she's here with us
[45:52] this morning
[45:53] so his word
[45:59] his word is the same
[46:03] he never changes
[46:05] if you have a need upon your heart this
[46:06] morning you can raise it before him if
[46:08] it's small or big however his work
[46:10] covers it all because his blood had been
[46:13] shed on Calvary
[46:14] and it's already a done work amen
[46:18] nothing he could do for you that he
[46:20] already has done it
[46:22] amen let's just bow our heads that we
[46:24] just approached the king this morning
[46:27] Heavenly Father Lord we're such a
[46:29] privileged people
[46:31] a lot of people that has access to your
[46:34] blood
[46:35] of people that you redeemed before the
[46:37] foundation of the world Lord and now
[46:40] we're just walking through the steps
[46:42] that you foreign before us to walk into
[46:44] and love
[46:45] and so Lord we're here in humility this
[46:48] morning asking Lord that whatever need
[46:50] there is on your Bright's heart
[46:52] and the ones that were read and all the
[46:55] testimonies that we've read Lord that
[46:56] you come and you deliver and you provide
[46:59] and let the Holy Spirit come and do a
[47:01] work because it's a perfect work Lord
[47:04] and the trials that we go to is not some
[47:07] strange thing Lord but it's something
[47:09] that you've allowed us to go through
[47:10] because it's the faith that takes us out
[47:12] of the situation
[47:14] so this morning by your blood we ask
[47:17] Lord to
[47:19] cleanse us to heal us to deliver us to
[47:22] fill us
[47:24] to give us more of your spirit more of
[47:26] your character and so much that we
[47:28] reflect you Lord every day of our life
[47:30] every hour that we are able to look upon
[47:33] your word that you give us Revelation
[47:36] just like we heard
[47:37] Lord we asked this morning that you
[47:39] bless the man of God that would step
[47:41] behind here and that you fill them and
[47:43] then you just speak to us this morning
[47:44] Lord
[47:45] Lord we're in such a unique and special
[47:48] time where you're uniting with your
[47:50] bride Lord
[47:51] it's intimate it's special let us not
[47:54] miss it because we want to be there Lord
[47:56] Jesus we want to pull on your gift we
[47:58] want to pull on your word we ask Lord
[48:00] that you bless us you be with us
[48:03] and you also bless the tithes and the
[48:05] offerings Lord and
[48:06] further and for your kingdom in Jesus

[52:55] our heavenly father
[53:00] Lord you're worthy of all praise and
[53:03] worship
[53:06] father is
[53:08] humans
[53:10] were incapable of
[53:16] giving you the worship that you deserve
[53:22] the Lord you chose to shed Your Love
[53:24] upon us
[53:27] that we can be partakers of your great
[53:30] nature
[53:32] and we're so grateful for that this
[53:34] morning Lord
[53:36] we ask that you
[53:38] touch our hearts today and our lives and
[53:42] build us up
[53:44] make us strong in you
[53:47] that we might obtain victories that we
[53:50] never even thought could be possible
[53:53] may we Rise Above All doubt and all fear
[53:57] and may we come to know you in the power
[54:00] and might of your great resurrection and
[54:03] your creative power
[54:05] we ask that you'd impart yourself to
[54:08] each of us this morning Father that we
[54:11] could love and serve you better we asked
[54:14] these things this morning in Jesus
[54:16] precious and wonderful name we pray amen
[54:20] amen God bless you this morning amen if
[54:24] you have your Bibles this morning uh
[54:27] thank you musicians certainly enjoyed
[54:29] that those specials and and uh
[54:34] um
[54:35] yeah I just I just thought they're
[54:37] perfect with this morning's service and
[54:40] also uh the psalm reading I thought it
[54:44] went perfect that and it's nice to have
[54:46] a
[54:49] Stefan's back and a lot of of us back a
[54:54] lot of us are gone for the wedding and
[54:56] different things but it's nice
[54:58] I guess brother Tim I guess you didn't
[55:00] realize you had so many brothers and
[55:02] sisters did his family got together this
[55:05] last week I think all 10 of is it 10 all
[55:09] 10 of the brothers and sisters for the
[55:10] first time in almost 20 years so I I
[55:13] thought that was really spectacular I
[55:16] just got to spend a few days in Montana
[55:19] I went back to where Sharon was born and
[55:22] back to the ranch and and uh up to the
[55:26] places I worked and I is blessing but
[55:29] you know it's beautiful country and but
[55:33] God has me here so would just rejoice in
[55:36] that amen I appreciate it so much let's
[55:39] turn it into Hebrews and and
[55:44] we want to read
[55:45] in
[55:48] the
[55:49] 11th uh
[55:51] chapter am I of Hebrews here
[55:57] and the very familiar scriptures to you
[56:00] all I'm sure you have a memorized but we
[56:04] want to just um
[56:06] think deep on these things this morning
[56:10] now Faith is the substance of things
[56:12] hoped for
[56:14] the evidence of Things Not Seen
[56:18] for by it the elders obtained a good
[56:23] report
[56:25] through faith we understand
[56:28] that the worlds were framed by the word
[56:32] of God
[56:33] so that things which are seen were not
[56:38] made of things which do appear
[56:42] how do you know that by faith
[56:46] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[56:49] excellent sacrifice than Cain
[56:53] by which he obtained witness that he was
[56:57] righteous
[56:58] God testifying of his gifts and by it
[57:04] being dead yet speaketh
[57:07] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[57:12] should not see death
[57:14] and was not found
[57:17] because God hath translated him
[57:20] for before his translation he had this
[57:25] testimony that he pleased God
[57:28] now
[57:30] just for me to interject that there you
[57:34] know
[57:35] we're part of that enact type
[57:38] right and so just let's let's just run
[57:42] that uh
[57:44] go back over that verse Again by faith
[57:49] in it was translated
[57:53] so he possessed something that
[57:55] translated him
[57:57] that he should not see death
[58:01] and was not found
[58:04] because God had translated him
[58:08] for before his translation he had this
[58:12] testimony
[58:14] so before he was translated he had to
[58:17] have this testimony
[58:19] that he pleased God
[58:23] so keep pleased God now look at how that
[58:26] he comes back and tells us how we please
[58:29] God but without faith it is impossible
[58:33] to please him
[58:35] for he that cometh to God must believe
[58:38] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[58:43] them that diligently seek Him Heavenly
[58:47] Father we ask you to bless your word to
[58:49] us in Jesus precious name we pray amen
[58:52] amen God bless you you may be seated
[58:59] uh
[59:01] certainly a uh
[59:03] a wonderful
[59:06] a scriptural reading and
[59:09] we know that the word of God tells us
[59:13] this morning that we're living in
[59:16] perilous times
[59:18] and uh
[59:20] and that this would be a time that man
[59:25] would no longer wish to retain God in
[59:29] his thinking or his knowledge so man
[59:33] doesn't even want to consider the
[59:37] involvement of God in his affairs
[59:40] if I could say it in this words like
[59:45] this that man has decided to take care
[59:49] of himself
[59:51] because they have made a decision in
[59:53] their heart that we can make it
[59:57] we can make the decisions we can make
[1:00:00] the things that we have need of we can
[1:00:04] use science we can use education we can
[1:00:08] use civilization that they they seek
[1:00:12] after all things that are carnal
[1:00:17] and all things that are within their
[1:00:20] understanding and their reasoning but
[1:00:23] they have eliminated and separated the
[1:00:28] supernatural from their life
[1:00:32] and this is uh uh
[1:00:37] very uh meaningful to me this morning
[1:00:42] because I I feel in my heart
[1:00:46] that the the church World in general and
[1:00:51] Christianity in general is relying to
[1:00:56] more on theology
[1:00:59] than faith
[1:01:02] and the great part of what was going to
[1:01:06] be restored to the church in this last
[1:01:09] day was the faith that our fathers had
[1:01:13] and so so
[1:01:17] it's so important and and I want to
[1:01:21] listen this morning to 30 minutes out of
[1:01:24] the sermon called uh the the super sense
[1:01:29] and and also preached as The Sixth Sense
[1:01:34] the fact that there's an uh something
[1:01:37] that a Believer has within them that's
[1:01:41] called faith
[1:01:43] we know that faith is synonymous with
[1:01:46] the word revelation but it's something
[1:01:50] inside the believer that they have and
[1:01:54] it is a gift of God lest any man should
[1:01:58] boast you never created your own faith
[1:02:01] you know you can't muster up Faith you
[1:02:05] can't you can have a strong mental
[1:02:08] attitude you can try to think that it's
[1:02:11] uh uh Mind Over Matter uh books and
[1:02:16] things are are written about how that if
[1:02:20] you can think right you can think
[1:02:22] straight or you can do this that you can
[1:02:25] do all things through the the power of
[1:02:29] the mind uh I believe that even
[1:02:32] Scientology comes to that point where
[1:02:36] they feel that if you can think in the
[1:02:38] right way and you can think in the right
[1:02:40] attitude and and you can accept approach
[1:02:44] things in a certain
[1:02:46] mindset that that will give you Victory
[1:02:49] and and I don't want that to be my
[1:02:52] victory if you understand I I want to
[1:02:54] see God in my life I want to see the
[1:02:57] hand of God I want to see the
[1:02:59] Supernatural and I I believe that God
[1:03:02] expresses his love to us because he gave
[1:03:05] us exceedingly great and precious
[1:03:08] promises that by these promises we might
[1:03:12] be partakers of divine nature so God
[1:03:16] wants to have fellowship with us
[1:03:18] God wants wants to be in our lives he
[1:03:22] didn't set us out and put us in a maze
[1:03:25] and just say I hope you can wait make
[1:03:28] your way through this Maze and and
[1:03:30] figure your way out and acting down
[1:03:33] life's path you know there's things you
[1:03:36] should do and things you shouldn't do I
[1:03:38] I want to get out of the place where my
[1:03:41] life is in my own hands
[1:03:44] now that's hard to do it's hard to die
[1:03:48] to yourself it's hard to die to your
[1:03:50] feelings it's hard to die to your
[1:03:52] emotions if it's hard to die to uh not
[1:03:57] that that
[1:03:58] self-preservation instinct that we
[1:04:01] automatically have
[1:04:04] I always ask myself you know and in my
[1:04:08] heart I I hear great Heroes and and uh
[1:04:13] like our law enforcement and First
[1:04:16] Responders those people that put
[1:04:18] themselves in In Harm's Way because of a
[1:04:22] duty to a service I always Marvel when
[1:04:25] when they the at the trying to
[1:04:28] assassinate when the uh the gentleman
[1:04:32] tried to assassinate a president Ronald
[1:04:35] Reagan how they showed that uh that that
[1:04:39] secret service agent turning and jumping
[1:04:42] in front of the president and and taking
[1:04:45] that uh that uh bullet
[1:04:50] to stand for his president and that's in
[1:04:54] the world that courage for something
[1:04:56] that he believed you know that's not
[1:04:58] something to mock at because that that's
[1:05:01] not something to put down you know look
[1:05:03] I mean we just had a policeman get in a
[1:05:06] very serious accident right here on our
[1:05:09] church grounds after the other day A car
[1:05:11] pulled out in front of him and he ran
[1:05:14] his motorcycle into him these people
[1:05:16] possess something you understand they're
[1:05:19] willing to lay down their lives they're
[1:05:21] willing to do for their Duty uh and I
[1:05:25] think that's honorable
[1:05:26] and I asked myself you know would I do
[1:05:30] that do I have that within me to to uh
[1:05:35] if if it came down to Choosing My Life
[1:05:39] or somebody else's life
[1:05:42] would I sacrifice my life for their life
[1:05:46] and yet that's what he did
[1:05:51] he laid down his life that we could live
[1:05:56] and so I think it's time that that
[1:05:59] there's the believer has got to move out
[1:06:03] of his head into his heart
[1:06:08] there's got to be another source that's
[1:06:11] that's moving up from within sight of us
[1:06:14] the love of God shed abroad in our heart
[1:06:17] by the holy spirit that great love that
[1:06:21] he had no man hath greater love than to
[1:06:23] lay down his life for another
[1:06:27] that's that's quite the test wouldn't
[1:06:30] you say
[1:06:31] and I haven't had to be put to that test
[1:06:35] again I I pray that if that challenge
[1:06:40] ever came to me
[1:06:41] that there'd be something inside of me
[1:06:45] that could meet that challenge
[1:06:50] that I would be so confident
[1:06:53] that there is a land beyond the river
[1:06:56] that there be I'd be so confident that
[1:06:59] there was life after death that I'd be
[1:07:02] so confident that that that there's no
[1:07:05] way that a good work would go unrewarded
[1:07:08] that I know that this life isn't my life
[1:07:12] that Beyond this realm that I see in
[1:07:15] that there's a God
[1:07:17] that lives
[1:07:19] Kenny wants to be in the Affairs of men
[1:07:22] he wants to do for you
[1:07:26] exceedingly and abundantly above that
[1:07:29] which you can ask or think and there's
[1:07:32] one Avenue to that and that's by faith
[1:07:38] it's hard to let go
[1:07:40] and we battle and we listen to this
[1:07:46] great
[1:07:47] explanation
[1:07:49] of the The Sixth Sense
[1:07:52] of of what that it is what where it is
[1:07:58] how that it works what it identifies
[1:08:02] itself with
[1:08:03] what it what it what it attaches itself
[1:08:06] to faith has got to have a resting place
[1:08:10] it's got to have an absolute it's got to
[1:08:14] have something that it believes above
[1:08:17] all other things that this is the
[1:08:19] reality that that's what it has it can't
[1:08:23] be Ever Changing like science it can't
[1:08:26] be Ever Changing like knowledge it can't
[1:08:29] be Ever Changing like technology if it's
[1:08:33] real it is it always has been and it
[1:08:37] always will be
[1:08:39] and it's not it's not a thought it is a
[1:08:43] substance faith is the substance it's
[1:08:46] the evidence of things hoped for not yet
[1:08:49] seen it's absolutely a possession that
[1:08:53] you have it within your soul it's
[1:08:56] something you know you've got you know
[1:08:58] that's there and it responds it's not
[1:09:03] governed by time it's not governed by
[1:09:06] circumstances it's not governed by what
[1:09:08] you see or what you feel it's something
[1:09:11] that you've got you've got it you know
[1:09:14] it's there and it's unmovable
[1:09:20] and I believe that's the church that
[1:09:22] God's looking for
[1:09:25] we know that faith and love are are in
[1:09:28] unison
[1:09:30] if I could say that may I don't have the
[1:09:32] vocabulary but it's a union it's a
[1:09:35] partnership you can't have one without
[1:09:38] the other
[1:09:40] it's an eternal Bond just like doubt and
[1:09:44] fear right right are tied together and
[1:09:48] perfect love cast out all fear and
[1:09:51] lack of fear will give you faith
[1:09:56] we're striving for this
[1:09:59] and I think our failure so many times
[1:10:02] and I'm only preaching to this body this
[1:10:05] morning those that God I'm not preaching
[1:10:08] a worldwide sermon and I'm not trying to
[1:10:10] reach across the Airways and actually
[1:10:14] just for us that our fellowshipping one
[1:10:17] with another
[1:10:18] here in this body to be a burning light
[1:10:21] and a a shine him out in our daily lives
[1:10:26] and contact the people that we have
[1:10:28] contact that they might be able by
[1:10:31] looking at you and your faith know that
[1:10:35] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:37] forever that they might inquire of you
[1:10:39] what is this hope that you have what is
[1:10:42] this Joy about you what is this peace
[1:10:45] you have what is this expectation that
[1:10:48] you've got what is this what is it that
[1:10:51] you're living for oh I'm living for a
[1:10:54] land beyond the river amen I know
[1:10:57] there's a in my father's house her many
[1:11:00] mansions I would not tell you if it were
[1:11:02] not so
[1:11:04] I've got something to live for amen
[1:11:08] there's a hell to shun and a heaven to
[1:11:11] gain
[1:11:12] amen I I'm sold out
[1:11:15] for what he taught
[1:11:17] I believe it with all my heart have we
[1:11:21] know that
[1:11:22] we have an enemy that goes about
[1:11:27] like a roaring lion
[1:11:30] seeking whom he may devour
[1:11:34] and I hope this connector in a little
[1:11:36] bit this morning he's not so much about
[1:11:40] devouring your flesh
[1:11:42] but he's a whole lot about devouring
[1:11:45] your faith
[1:11:47] he wants to take away your confidence
[1:11:52] in the Living God
[1:11:56] just think if he can break that down
[1:11:59] all he wants you to do is disbelieve the
[1:12:04] one that can do all things for all
[1:12:08] things are possible only believe all
[1:12:12] things are possible
[1:12:15] the value of faith
[1:12:19] to the bride in this last hour cannot be
[1:12:23] overemphasized
[1:12:26] revelation
[1:12:29] it can't be over emphasized it we've got
[1:12:33] to move from the realm of understanding
[1:12:37] which I believe the word of God is given
[1:12:40] to be understood
[1:12:41] I will even sound doctrine that you must
[1:12:45] have sound Doctrine because that you're
[1:12:48] you're thinking needs to line up with
[1:12:50] the word of God but I believe that God
[1:12:54] with all my heart is trying to give his
[1:12:57] children the possession of of the the
[1:13:02] sense that activates the word of God and
[1:13:07] that where they live by the word of God
[1:13:09] they think by the word of God they trust
[1:13:12] in the word of God the word of God
[1:13:15] becomes a reality because remember Faith
[1:13:19] doesn't lie
[1:13:24] amen so if if you would uh
[1:13:28] uh bear with me this morning and maybe
[1:13:33] it's not in the Traditions that you
[1:13:36] would normally do but if you could just
[1:13:40] listen with me this morning if you would
[1:13:42] just indulge me in listening to this 30
[1:13:46] minutes of the understanding of the
[1:13:50] difference between faith and senses
[1:13:55] and what is ruling man and how man has
[1:14:01] to
[1:14:02] change his headship
[1:14:05] to what governs their life
[1:14:07] there's also in this little 30 minutes a
[1:14:10] wonderful explanation for those of you
[1:14:13] who love to study the scriptures
[1:14:17] of the the the these verses that are
[1:14:20] some of the most misunderstood verses
[1:14:23] can as out of the First Corinthians the
[1:14:26] 12th chapter it says now conspiring
[1:14:29] concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I
[1:14:32] would not have you be ignorant
[1:14:34] for ye know that ye were Gentiles
[1:14:38] carried away unto these dumb Idols even
[1:14:42] as you were LED
[1:14:44] wherefore I'd give you to understand
[1:14:48] that no man speaketh by the spirit of
[1:14:51] God calleth Christ the cursed and that
[1:14:56] no man can say that Jesus is Lord but by
[1:15:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] and that's a very misunderstood
[1:15:06] scripture because a lot of people say
[1:15:08] Jesus is Lord
[1:15:09] a lot of them take his name in vain but
[1:15:12] there's a deep understanding to that it
[1:15:15] unfolds in this we won't go into that
[1:15:17] this morning but I hope that you could
[1:15:20] pick it up I believe this morning no
[1:15:23] matter what your background is no matter
[1:15:26] where you're from the word of God will
[1:15:29] bless you
[1:15:30] and and I believe listening to this and
[1:15:35] this great explanation of how that the
[1:15:38] word of God has got to come in and
[1:15:41] govern it and then me as the pastor of
[1:15:43] this assembly it's my way of this
[1:15:46] morning to reaching out to all of us to
[1:15:50] say we need our faith increased
[1:15:57] we need to start moving and trusting
[1:16:00] more in the Supernatural this world is
[1:16:04] slowly turning against the freedoms that
[1:16:08] we are are
[1:16:10] having now for the freedom of speech the
[1:16:14] freedom of religion the freedom those
[1:16:17] are slowly beginning to erode
[1:16:21] as man begins to feel that they know
[1:16:24] what's best
[1:16:26] we know what's best can you imagine the
[1:16:30] day that they declare the preaching of
[1:16:33] Divine Healing
[1:16:34] as a false
[1:16:37] hope
[1:16:40] or you can't you can't speak against the
[1:16:44] the sins of Solomon Gomorrah because
[1:16:48] they feel that's degrading another human
[1:16:52] being
[1:16:55] can you imagine slowly but surely
[1:16:58] legally taking your rights to have free
[1:17:02] speech
[1:17:03] the scripture tells us the time will
[1:17:05] come that they will take your life
[1:17:07] thinking that they're doing God a
[1:17:10] service
[1:17:12] can you say oh is there scripture just
[1:17:14] think Paul
[1:17:16] went about imprisoning the church in
[1:17:20] order to rid
[1:17:23] Israel of this heresy called
[1:17:26] Christianity
[1:17:28] can you imagine the religious rulers of
[1:17:31] our day wanting to rid the Pentecostal
[1:17:35] experience the born-agained experience
[1:17:38] the gifts of God of Divine Healing and
[1:17:42] can the moving of the spirit of God to
[1:17:44] rid that heresy from the church world
[1:17:48] oh let me tell you the mark of the beast
[1:17:51] is in the air
[1:17:53] amen it's coming soon
[1:17:56] if it's not already here in a spiritual
[1:17:59] form
[1:18:00] so we just trust this morning
[1:18:03] that your faith that'll contact
[1:18:06] something in you that you'll see the
[1:18:10] need
[1:18:12] for you to possess
[1:18:15] faith
[1:18:16] and if you lack Faith cry out this
[1:18:20] morning Lord help my
[1:18:23] unbelief
[1:18:25] help me Lord
[1:18:27] move more into the realm of faith help
[1:18:30] me step up higher help me believe your
[1:18:33] worth help me Lord I'm needy are you
[1:18:36] needy I need more faith this morning I
[1:18:39] need to love them more I need to serve
[1:18:42] them more I can't live in this
[1:18:44] Wilderness of of of
[1:18:47] risk dry religious Wilderness any longer
[1:18:52] I want to move up in the Realms of faith
[1:18:55] I want to believe for the impossible I
[1:18:58] want to see him manifested in the
[1:19:01] Supernatural just Lord bless you this
[1:19:05] morning as we listen from the sermon
[1:19:08] called a super sense of 12 27
[1:19:15] 1959 you say oh that's awful low 59
[1:19:18] that's 56 years ago the word of God has
[1:19:22] never changed
[1:19:24] I believe if we go back in time we could
[1:19:27] have heard a sermon very similar to this
[1:19:29] preached by Paul God bless you this
[1:19:32] morning I believe it will be a a
[1:19:35] blessing to you thank you brother Mike
[1:19:46] senses
[1:19:49] we are taught that the natural man has
[1:19:53] five senses in those five senses control
[1:19:57] his
[1:19:59] is
[1:20:00] or give God gave him these five senses
[1:20:04] to contact
[1:20:06] his Earthly home
[1:20:09] and those senses are known as sea taste
[1:20:13] feel smell here
[1:20:16] those five senses which are known to the
[1:20:20] Natural man
[1:20:22] and they are good
[1:20:25] and we cannot
[1:20:28] operate or live a normal life
[1:20:32] when one of these senses fail to act
[1:20:36] your sight hearing feelings smelling or
[1:20:39] tasting
[1:20:40] we cannot be normal without them
[1:20:44] there's something missing
[1:20:46] some potion of life that we cannot
[1:20:49] contact without that sense acting
[1:20:54] and they're good and they're useful
[1:20:58] and they were given to us by God
[1:21:02] gave those senses
[1:21:06] but they're given to you as a gift
[1:21:12] and it depends on how you watch you
[1:21:16] yield these senses to
[1:21:19] will be the way that your life is
[1:21:22] controlled
[1:21:24] the way you yield those five senses your
[1:21:28] what you see
[1:21:29] what you hear
[1:21:31] what you taste smell our field
[1:21:36] whatever those senses are yielded to
[1:21:39] they will dominate you
[1:21:43] and we are grateful to God that we have
[1:21:47] the five senses
[1:21:49] but
[1:21:51] by no me no Meats was these five senses
[1:21:55] given to you to guide you
[1:22:00] they were given to you for Earthly
[1:22:02] contact
[1:22:05] but there was giving you the Sixth Sense
[1:22:10] and that's Sixth Sense
[1:22:13] is belongs only to the Christian
[1:22:19] and you cannot have this Sixth Sense
[1:22:22] until you become a Christian
[1:22:27] is the only way that you could ever have
[1:22:30] any more than the five natural senses
[1:22:34] for the natural person
[1:22:37] but Sixth Sense is better known to the
[1:22:41] Christian as faith
[1:22:44] it's the one that governs and guides you
[1:22:48] and it is superior to all the other
[1:22:53] senses
[1:22:55] it's a superior
[1:22:58] to all of the senses the other five
[1:23:02] senses
[1:23:04] now I would not say that because that we
[1:23:07] receive the Sixth Sense
[1:23:11] that the five senses are no good no more
[1:23:15] yes they are
[1:23:17] those five senses were given to you by
[1:23:20] God
[1:23:21] and they are to be used
[1:23:24] but
[1:23:25] when the five senses
[1:23:29] act contrary to the word of God than
[1:23:33] they are lying
[1:23:37] Now The Sixth Sense cannot lie
[1:23:41] it's a super sense
[1:23:45] and that's what I want to speak about
[1:23:47] this morning I spoke on a super sign
[1:23:51] and tonight on the super sense
[1:23:55] and the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[1:24:00] the faith of God that dwells in you
[1:24:06] and if you let
[1:24:09] the five senses be yielded to The Sixth
[1:24:13] Sense it'll guide you and bring all the
[1:24:17] other five senses under control of that
[1:24:21] super sense
[1:24:22] for it's so far above the natural sense
[1:24:27] as a spiritual man is above the natural
[1:24:31] it's as far as high as the heavens is
[1:24:33] above the natural man and his five
[1:24:37] senses
[1:24:41] it makes you believe things that you
[1:24:43] cannot see
[1:24:45] it makes you act or you do not think the
[1:24:48] five senses would ever think about it
[1:24:52] the devil can get into these five senses
[1:24:56] and lie to you
[1:24:58] but he cannot touch that super sense
[1:25:03] that's far beyond his reach
[1:25:06] that come from God
[1:25:10] it's called faith
[1:25:15] faith is that great thing
[1:25:19] and
[1:25:22] the five senses does not control the
[1:25:25] sixth sense but the Sixth Sense controls
[1:25:28] the five senses
[1:25:30] the super sense
[1:25:32] controls the natural senses
[1:25:36] and the these
[1:25:39] five senses is see tasty of smell here
[1:25:42] and the super sense is something that
[1:25:45] will make you believe God's word well
[1:25:47] that's the only thing it'll speak about
[1:25:50] and it'll make you believe for things
[1:25:52] that you can't see tasty you'll smell or
[1:25:55] hear
[1:25:57] because it'll take God's word
[1:26:00] and it will deliver that word to you and
[1:26:03] make you walk contrary to any other
[1:26:07] thing there is but God's word
[1:26:11] by faith Faith doesn't
[1:26:15] now
[1:26:16] in giving this illustration
[1:26:19] of the senses the natural man is born
[1:26:23] with these senses so they are nature
[1:26:26] given senses
[1:26:28] and that's really only thing you'll ever
[1:26:31] know about it in his intellectual
[1:26:33] thinking
[1:26:35] he can only think as the man
[1:26:37] you can see as a man
[1:26:40] he can understand as a man
[1:26:42] here is the man
[1:26:45] but when he becomes govern are
[1:26:49] regenerated
[1:26:51] or we would call it born again
[1:26:56] then that's six Super sense takes a hold
[1:26:59] of him
[1:27:02] in doing so that's super sense raises
[1:27:06] him up into a spot
[1:27:08] don't worry yes Faith to believe things
[1:27:11] that he could not hear things that he
[1:27:13] could not see understandings that he
[1:27:16] could not understand he believes it
[1:27:18] anyhow because he's governed by that
[1:27:21] Sixth Sense
[1:27:22] not super sense
[1:27:26] oh how marvelous it is
[1:27:30] to know it and to think how simple it is
[1:27:36] to believe it
[1:27:38] now you cannot believe it until you are
[1:27:41] regenerated
[1:27:43] the Bible said that no man can call
[1:27:46] Jesus a Christ only by the Holy Ghost
[1:27:50] we went through that this last week
[1:27:53] and it's been such a stumbling block
[1:27:56] especially to the Pentecostal of
[1:27:59] believing people
[1:28:01] when they hear me say that Jesus said
[1:28:03] and Saint John 5 24 he that heareth my
[1:28:07] word and believeth on him it sent me has
[1:28:10] eternal life
[1:28:12] eternal life comes from God Alone
[1:28:16] and no man can say Jesus is the Christ
[1:28:19] only by the Holy Ghost
[1:28:22] you're only taking what somebody else
[1:28:25] said what you learned by intellectual
[1:28:27] what you learn by the natural five
[1:28:30] senses
[1:28:31] but when the Sixth Sense comes in the
[1:28:34] Holy Spirit it takes away all the
[1:28:36] reasons of these six senses and five
[1:28:39] senses and lifts you up into that sixth
[1:28:41] sense to make you believe things that
[1:28:43] you can't see taste
[1:28:47] does something to you
[1:28:49] then you can say Jesus is the Christ
[1:28:52] because you have witnessed it
[1:28:55] not what intellectual teaching has
[1:28:57] taught you but what you've experienced
[1:29:03] what is the sixth sense to do then
[1:29:05] brother Branham why did The Sixth Sense
[1:29:07] come The Sixth Sense come for this
[1:29:11] reason now six senses of Faith the super
[1:29:13] sense
[1:29:15] now
[1:29:16] if the Sixth Sense come for this reason
[1:29:19] only that was to make the five senses in
[1:29:24] you deny anything that's contrary to
[1:29:27] God's word
[1:29:29] that's what the sixth senses are
[1:29:32] the scripture speaks of casting down
[1:29:35] reasons
[1:29:37] the the fear five senses will you can
[1:29:40] reason well now why should this man why
[1:29:45] should but the Sixth Sense doesn't see
[1:29:47] that at all it's so far beyond it
[1:29:51] it's so much higher than it is
[1:29:54] until it don't even have any reasons no
[1:29:58] with it we believe it
[1:30:01] far beyond anything that the five senses
[1:30:05] would have to say about it
[1:30:08] now
[1:30:09] get ready for a healing service
[1:30:12] see
[1:30:14] we believe it
[1:30:15] you walk by that Sixth Sense
[1:30:19] you talk for that Sixth Sense
[1:30:23] that's Sixth Sense
[1:30:26] you God I'm about to have Sixth Sense
[1:30:28] and rise for that sixth sense that's
[1:30:32] super sense
[1:30:33] something that's in you that's different
[1:30:35] from what the natural man is
[1:30:38] the natural man only has these and
[1:30:40] they're all right if they can be brought
[1:30:42] in submission to The Sixth Sense
[1:30:46] if the natural mind says read the word
[1:30:49] of God and says that is the word of God
[1:30:51] is speaking the truth but if it reasons
[1:30:53] that's not all the word of God or or it
[1:30:56] was something it was one time but it
[1:30:59] isn't now then that Sixth Sense comes in
[1:31:01] and says he's the same yesterday today
[1:31:03] and forever
[1:31:06] see that's the difference
[1:31:09] that's why that so many people fail to
[1:31:12] be healed
[1:31:14] they're trying to come with an
[1:31:17] intellectual conception
[1:31:20] they say oh I um I do this or I believe
[1:31:24] this and so forth but if that Sixth
[1:31:27] Sense is saying that
[1:31:29] there's nothing you'll ever shake them
[1:31:31] from that Sixth Sense
[1:31:36] the Sixth Sense is come upon the human
[1:31:39] being to make them deny anything that's
[1:31:42] contrary to the word of God
[1:31:45] any symptom
[1:31:48] any symptom that's contrary to God's
[1:31:50] promise the sixth sense as it is man
[1:31:57] if the Christian that's born again
[1:32:00] and the first thing you know is some
[1:32:02] Infidel unbeliever gets around to the
[1:32:05] Christian and so now look here there's
[1:32:07] no such a thing as that Holy Ghost
[1:32:09] you're just mistaken in that you're
[1:32:12] crazy if you believe such stuff is that
[1:32:14] there's no such a thing as it that's
[1:32:16] success
[1:32:17] straight to work
[1:32:21] let me show you in the Bible where you
[1:32:23] can't receive the Holy Ghost you see I
[1:32:25] can show you where the disciples are got
[1:32:27] it but uh but yeah well you say look at
[1:32:30] the sixth sense of points you always say
[1:32:31] but he said the promise isn't to you to
[1:32:33] your children well that meant their
[1:32:35] children there that didn't mean for you
[1:32:37] it isn't for you but that Sixth Sense
[1:32:39] knows better
[1:32:40] why it's already in you
[1:32:43] they've said it too late you've already
[1:32:46] received it
[1:32:51] people who talking there is no such
[1:32:52] thing as the Holy Spirit don't know what
[1:32:54] they're talking about
[1:32:57] like a boy once peeling an apple and was
[1:33:01] asked by the Infidel debating a meeting
[1:33:04] he said what do you want what do you
[1:33:06] want up here he said I'm going to ask
[1:33:07] you a question while he was eating the
[1:33:10] apple and enjoying it a very simple sort
[1:33:13] of a look like a delinquent person with
[1:33:16] the hair hanging in his face and one
[1:33:19] tooth out in front of an old dirty
[1:33:20] overhaul jacket on he said just one
[1:33:23] question I want to ask you
[1:33:26] the infidelity just said there is no
[1:33:28] such a thing as God it's all emotion
[1:33:31] is nonsense to it is all it is and the
[1:33:35] boy said I want to ask you a question
[1:33:36] Mister is this apple sweeter sour
[1:33:40] is it a hard-on or I'm not eating it he
[1:33:43] said that's just what I thought walked
[1:33:45] right back how do you know when you
[1:33:48] haven't tasted the Lord how do you know
[1:33:51] when you've never received the Holy
[1:33:53] Ghost whether he's real or whether he is
[1:33:54] not
[1:33:56] how do you know where there's faith and
[1:33:58] power how do you know there's not Giants
[1:34:01] speakable and full of Glory when you've
[1:34:03] never tasted to see it
[1:34:06] The Sixth Sense leads you to them
[1:34:09] The Sixth Sense declares that to you
[1:34:12] there's no intellectual Powers at all
[1:34:14] I'll ever bring that to you the
[1:34:16] intellectual Powers will reason and say
[1:34:18] well it's psychology it's something this
[1:34:20] way it's emotion with the people but
[1:34:23] when the Sixth Sense comes in it denies
[1:34:25] all of those sayings and moves the
[1:34:28] person straight into the bosoms of God
[1:34:31] either come to God must believe that he
[1:34:34] is and a rewarder of those that
[1:34:36] diligently seek him
[1:34:38] by Faith by faith
[1:34:41] Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Jacob
[1:34:45] all by faith
[1:34:48] it's the Sixth Sense
[1:34:50] that does it Sixth Sense denies all
[1:34:53] Simpsons all symptoms
[1:34:55] anything contrary to God's word any
[1:34:58] feeling emotion somebody say oh well I
[1:35:02] was praying for but I just don't feel

[1:39:28] presence something had to take place
[1:39:33] the sense was super sense was God there
[1:39:36] was something telling Martha that
[1:39:38] she'd seen him she knowed him she didn't
[1:39:41] recognize him to be the very Messiah and
[1:39:44] she note if she could only get to him

[1:39:50] present the case
[1:39:52] just share one promise come from me
[1:39:55] that's all she wanted
[1:39:58] when he said I am the resurrection wife
[1:40:01] ye that believeth in me though he were
[1:40:04] dead that's all Martha wanted to hear
[1:40:07] oh she won't even cause the sixth sense
[1:40:10] to Super sense her faith was moving her
[1:40:12] to confessing
[1:40:14] believe him
[1:40:16] this woman when she left the platform it
[1:40:20] was thus saith the Lord
[1:40:22] go home and eat Jesus Christ makes you
[1:40:25] well
[1:40:28] she went home
[1:40:30] that night
[1:40:31] a friend of hers living in the
[1:40:33] neighborhood was stirred her forth
[1:40:36] behind her she had a big knot on her
[1:40:38] neck
[1:40:40] and here she come all thrilled about
[1:40:44] their our neighbor it was going to be
[1:40:46] healed that ulcer that had bothered her
[1:40:48] so much
[1:40:49] this is one of the hundreds of cases
[1:40:51] thousands of them
[1:40:53] and this big knot sticking out on her
[1:40:55] neck
[1:40:56] and she come up I said no one would have
[1:40:58] to discern that
[1:41:00] but you're happy about something you've
[1:41:02] been thrilled because that woman sitting
[1:41:04] over Yonder is a neighbor of yours
[1:41:08] Holy Spirit she thought how in the world
[1:41:10] could that man know that
[1:41:12] it has to be something to reveal it to
[1:41:15] you
[1:41:17] so when that was sin
[1:41:19] he said you're thinking about your neck
[1:41:21] yes do you believe it or leave I believe
[1:41:25] it she said with all my heart I said
[1:41:28] thus saith the Lord
[1:41:32] go home and you will receive your
[1:41:34] healing
[1:41:36] the natural man looked around and
[1:41:38] couldn't see no
[1:41:39] sign
[1:41:41] the woman with the ulcer went home and
[1:41:44] tried to eat in my she liked to died
[1:41:47] all the natural man the natural sense of
[1:41:50] feeling
[1:41:52] still declared the answer there
[1:41:55] so after about a week or two had passed
[1:41:59] she went to the neighborhood to all of
[1:42:02] her people in the church testifying the
[1:42:05] Lord has healed me
[1:42:07] and they said are you eating now
[1:42:10] no not exactly everything I want but she
[1:42:14] said I'm already healed for by his
[1:42:17] stripes I am healed
[1:42:21] no matter what well she's even anyhow
[1:42:24] one morning the children had gone to
[1:42:27] school
[1:42:28] and she got real hungry she was standing
[1:42:31] washing the dishes by the window she
[1:42:34] came to the meeting another meeting
[1:42:35] about a year later
[1:42:37] and she was washing the dishes
[1:42:40] and when she
[1:42:41] first thing she felt a real funny
[1:42:43] feeling go over
[1:42:46] and she thought what was that
[1:42:49] felt like I wanted to scream
[1:42:52] and her husband had told her said honey
[1:42:55] you quit talking about that healing that
[1:42:58] because although he was a Christian said
[1:43:01] you're bringing a reproach upon the
[1:43:03] calls how
[1:43:07] far into his word
[1:43:11] you'll bring a reproach if you don't
[1:43:13] testify
[1:43:16] that if you were healed you were healed
[1:43:17] she said that man stood and looked me in
[1:43:21] the eye and told me my conditions and
[1:43:24] the things that I had done and who I was
[1:43:26] and where I come from
[1:43:28] she said I hadn't been in the building
[1:43:30] 15 minutes when he come to the platform
[1:43:32] how in the world could this man know
[1:43:35] that I never saw him in my life
[1:43:38] and he told me that saith the Lord
[1:43:43] you're healed and she said
[1:43:45] I'll believe it until I'm dead
[1:43:50] he said I don't believe it anyhow
[1:43:54] so her and her sister a blower a friend
[1:43:57] had Covenant to God that they'd hold
[1:43:59] that pain that morning she felt real
[1:44:02] funny
[1:44:04] and a few minutes she got hungry
[1:44:06] so the children had left some oats in a
[1:44:09] plate a little dish and said oh it's
[1:44:13] always just burn her up if anybody ever
[1:44:15] had an officer you know what it is so
[1:44:17] she reached down and took a couple of
[1:44:19] nights of those oats
[1:44:20] oh my she said I have to pay for it I
[1:44:24] suppose but one of these days I'll be
[1:44:26] all right
[1:44:27] but she noticed she was still hungry
[1:44:30] so she just finished up the dish
[1:44:33] she waited a few minutes
[1:44:34] see what happened nothing happened felt
[1:44:38] good still hungry she fried her a couple
[1:44:40] eggs and poured her a cup of coffee and
[1:44:42] got some toast and had her real Jubilee
[1:44:44] she just eat all she could eat
[1:44:47] you want to help washing the dishes in
[1:44:49] about a half hour later she was hungry
[1:44:51] again
[1:44:53] no ill effects she put on her little
[1:44:56] Bonnet and down the street she went into
[1:44:58] this neighbor's house and when she got
[1:45:00] there she heard she thought they'd been
[1:45:02] a death baby in her family they were
[1:45:04] screaming and shouting and walking
[1:45:05] around the woman had slept late that
[1:45:08] morning and got up
[1:45:10] and far the growth that was on her neck
[1:45:13] and it had disappeared during the night
[1:45:18] it wasn't
[1:45:20] God at work
[1:45:26] up here title Tabernacle when we had
[1:45:29] that meeting
[1:45:30] that crippled boy that come in there was
[1:45:32] prayed for him
[1:45:34] many of us are to see him
[1:45:38] they brought him back in that emergency
[1:45:39] room Billy led me to him
[1:45:42] they had him on a platform for three or
[1:45:44] four nights they're on the in the
[1:45:46] building he didn't get a prayer card so
[1:45:48] they put him in the emergency room I
[1:45:50] went in and prayed for him looked at him
[1:45:52] he said Mr Branham
[1:45:54] can you tell me some consolation I said
[1:45:57] yes sir son
[1:45:58] polio got you this way he said that's
[1:46:00] right I said your name is such and such
[1:46:03] and come from a certain place that's
[1:46:04] right he said he said what about my
[1:46:07] healing I said by his stripes you were
[1:46:10] healed
[1:46:12] yeah he went home testifying giving God
[1:46:15] praise
[1:46:16] and he brought such a reproach they
[1:46:18] claim in the neighborhood until one
[1:46:20] Sunday a group of ministers come in and
[1:46:22] sit down by him
[1:46:24] and said you must stop doing that
[1:46:27] you're bringing a reproach upon the
[1:46:29] calls and the young man sitting there
[1:46:32] said mister if you were setting where I
[1:46:36] am if you were in the chair that I'm
[1:46:39] sitting in you would try to rob me of
[1:46:42] the last hope I got in Christ
[1:46:45] that by his stripes I am healed and you
[1:46:49] know lord said that sitting there
[1:46:51] paralyzed
[1:46:53] hands body back and the whole war that
[1:46:58] he's setting that in out of the Chariot
[1:47:00] glorifying God
[1:47:03] what
[1:47:04] his natural senses said he'll sit there
[1:47:07] the doctor said he'll be there forever
[1:47:09] or as long as he lives but the sixth
[1:47:12] sense says by his strike I am healed
[1:47:17] and he wouldn't have nothing to do it's
[1:47:19] casting way everything contrary to what
[1:47:22] God Said
[1:47:23] that's what the Sixth Sense is for
[1:47:37] that's what we need
[1:47:40] you know you can get lost in in so many
[1:47:44] things the Mysteries like Paul said
[1:47:47] though I understand all the Mysteries
[1:47:49] though I speak with the tongues of men
[1:47:52] and angels and I have not charity then
[1:47:55] it profits me nothing
[1:47:57] and and so many things are unprofitable
[1:48:00] the scripture tells us because it's not
[1:48:02] mixed with faith
[1:48:05] faith is contrary to reason faith is
[1:48:08] contrary see faith is now getting
[1:48:11] contrary to society
[1:48:13] it's contrary to civilization it's
[1:48:16] contrary to education it's it's contrary
[1:48:19] to everything
[1:48:22] and it it sets you apart
[1:48:25] and that's where there's coming the time
[1:48:27] there's coming a time there's going to
[1:48:29] be a separation between the sheeps and
[1:48:32] the goats and it's not by intellect
[1:48:35] is by what pleases God
[1:48:38] it's by faith
[1:48:40] is that that's something that's in you
[1:48:43] that says this is what the word says it
[1:48:46] doesn't matter how I feel how I think
[1:48:48] but I see what I taste in everything it
[1:48:51] it latches on to the word of God and
[1:48:55] calls everything contrary to it a liar
[1:49:01] this is the identity
[1:49:06] of the church
[1:49:09] because we know in the beginning the
[1:49:12] fall
[1:49:13] when Eve fell
[1:49:16] what she did is she disbelieved the word
[1:49:20] of God
[1:49:22] Satan got her to reason he said the day
[1:49:26] that I eat thereof is the day that
[1:49:28] you'll die he says no you won't die
[1:49:32] you won't die
[1:49:34] if you if you eat this tree you'll be
[1:49:37] like God you'll you'll have knowledge
[1:49:39] you'll you'll know all things you will
[1:49:43] you will
[1:49:45] you will you know he says if you if you
[1:49:48] do this you will
[1:49:50] you will there there he planted that
[1:49:52] seed of reasoning
[1:49:55] and unbelief
[1:49:58] because she just couldn't stay with it
[1:49:59] she had to let another thought come in
[1:50:03] another idea another voice something
[1:50:06] else another influence she got to
[1:50:09] thinking about it she got the reasoning
[1:50:11] about it oh well you know am I supposed
[1:50:13] to do this and am I supposed to do that
[1:50:15] and and it could just got her all
[1:50:18] stirred up in her mind and everything
[1:50:19] and and so she just she accepted
[1:50:24] Satan's lie as God's truth
[1:50:28] she let go of that she let go of that
[1:50:32] faith
[1:50:33] and took reasoning
[1:50:36] and then you know something what he said
[1:50:38] came to pass you will
[1:50:41] you will well now we're here
[1:50:44] we're living in the fruits of the tree
[1:50:47] of knowledge Forever Learning and never
[1:50:50] coming to the realization of God never
[1:50:53] coming to seeing the supernatural
[1:50:58] to believe for something
[1:51:00] we only want to believe for the things
[1:51:02] that we understand we only want to
[1:51:05] believe for the things that we can have
[1:51:07] a concept of how that they will come to
[1:51:10] pass how many times have you designed
[1:51:13] your own miracle I designed my own
[1:51:15] Miracle all the time if this would
[1:51:17] happen and that would happen and this
[1:51:19] would happen then God could do it and
[1:51:21] I'll give God God do it this way if you
[1:51:23] just give brother such and such a common
[1:51:25] such and such would do this and such and
[1:51:27] such would do that and you put this all
[1:51:29] together and I'll have a miracle
[1:51:33] Faith doesn't go by what it sees
[1:51:38] it goes by what he said
[1:51:43] now here we are
[1:51:45] we're living in the fruits of the tree
[1:51:48] of knowledge
[1:51:51] everything that Satan promised her
[1:51:54] if she would leave faith is here
[1:52:00] but now he's supposed to have a new Eve
[1:52:04] a new bride a new church
[1:52:08] a new restorated believer
[1:52:12] and she's got to go right back through
[1:52:15] that tree of life that tree excuse me
[1:52:18] that tree of knowledge
[1:52:20] got to go right back through it back to
[1:52:24] the beginning to get the faith that she
[1:52:27] said when she spoke it he said
[1:52:35] that's what she had she said the day
[1:52:38] that we eat is the day we die that's
[1:52:41] what he says and she got talked out of
[1:52:44] it
[1:52:45] well this whole world today
[1:52:48] is designed through education through
[1:52:51] science through civilization through the
[1:52:54] news through everything that you're
[1:52:57] hearing and everything to take that same
[1:53:00] Faith she had in the beginning
[1:53:04] that's what's got to be restored back to
[1:53:06] the church
[1:53:07] he said so that's the way it is Faith
[1:53:11] does not lie
[1:53:15] it's the end of the story
[1:53:18] but now we gotta socially fit things in
[1:53:22] you can't preach against homosexuality
[1:53:25] it's socially not right it is a sin
[1:53:30] and it is a spirit and it can be cast
[1:53:34] out and people can be delivered from it
[1:53:37] but don't ever tell me that it's God's
[1:53:39] way of life it's death
[1:53:44] I get phone calls so if you keep
[1:53:46] preaching like that they'll put you in
[1:53:47] prison praise God I'll preach to them
[1:53:50] and there they can get delivered
[1:53:54] everything is to get you to use your
[1:53:57] mind instead of your heart
[1:53:59] [Music]
[1:54:01] because faith loves God's word it's
[1:54:05] connected in the heart it's not
[1:54:06] connected in the mind when you hear it
[1:54:09] something on the inside of you says I
[1:54:11] love his word I love his scriptures I
[1:54:14] love what he said I believe it
[1:54:22] they teach them there's three gods they
[1:54:24] teach them this they teach them all that
[1:54:26] stuff
[1:54:28] the word of God hasn't changed
[1:54:32] boy you couldn't preach wives being
[1:54:34] subject to their husband
[1:54:36] he'd empty out the churches
[1:54:40] that you get a sister that's subject to
[1:54:42] your husband that's one happy sister
[1:54:44] she's got the joy bells ringing she
[1:54:47] knows God's gonna take her her husband
[1:54:49] might be Dumber in a mud fence but if
[1:54:51] she believes God's word God will take
[1:54:53] care of her
[1:54:58] God's word works
[1:55:01] everything else fail s it's been failing
[1:55:04] wars and rumors and Wars diseases they
[1:55:08] can't get control of this chaos there's
[1:55:10] only one way out then that's a promise
[1:55:13] of God's word look up your Redemption is
[1:55:16] near I have gone to prepare a place for
[1:55:18] you if it were not so I would not tell
[1:55:21] you I'll come again and receive you that
[1:55:24] where I am you may be also Hallelujah
[1:55:29] what happened to believe in that
[1:55:33] what happened if not taken no thought
[1:55:35] for tomorrow
[1:55:39] you know sometimes their sisters get so
[1:55:42] worried whether they get going to get
[1:55:44] married well you get worried you don't
[1:55:46] look very pretty
[1:55:48] quit worrying put this joy of the Lord
[1:55:50] on your heart a real Son of God will
[1:55:52] fall in love with you because you're
[1:55:54] going to fall in love for you for the
[1:55:55] right thing
[1:56:00] you don't got to go join Jenny Craig for
[1:56:02] five months to get married
[1:56:05] need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:56:08] I'm serious
[1:56:12] what doesn't do us good to go on in an
[1:56:15] intellectual concept just keep going
[1:56:17] over the Mysteries keep going over the
[1:56:19] history keep prove it
[1:56:22] I don't need to prove to any of you that
[1:56:25] God sent a Prophet this day he proved it
[1:56:27] himself
[1:56:31] but what did he come for
[1:56:33] was it to educate Us in the church ages
[1:56:36] wasn't to educate Us in the seals it
[1:56:40] wasn't the educators of the godhead it
[1:56:42] wasn't education it was the restoration
[1:56:45] of the faith that our brothers and
[1:56:47] sisters had that accepted them in the
[1:56:50] beginning
[1:56:52] that could believe in miracles could
[1:56:54] believe in the Supernatural and it was
[1:56:57] free
[1:57:00] it wasn't take you in the back room and
[1:57:03] say Well if you really believe then
[1:57:05] you'll give a two thousand dollar seed
[1:57:07] offering
[1:57:09] we're not going to send you up there on
[1:57:11] the platform to be prayed for
[1:57:13] if you can't demonstrate for to us that
[1:57:16] you believe First by giving a seed
[1:57:19] offering oh you don't think that goes on
[1:57:21] it's exactly what goes on
[1:57:24] I like the way God gives it Hallelujah
[1:57:28] he says you sir you're suffering with
[1:57:30] such and such you've been through
[1:57:32] something you're healed that's saith the
[1:57:34] Lord by his stripes you are healed free
[1:57:36] of charge
[1:57:40] don't need no gimmicks
[1:57:43] this world's dying for the true gospel
[1:57:46] God sent the true gospel in this age I'm
[1:57:49] not ashamed of Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30.
[1:57:52] Revelations 10 7 because it's the
[1:57:55] promised word of God come to pass on
[1:57:57] this day and it's the only thing that's
[1:57:59] going to return rapturing Faith back to
[1:58:02] the church
[1:58:03] [Music]
[1:58:06] I want to get raptured
[1:58:09] yes
[1:58:12] and it's the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:58:14] Jesus Christ dwelt in you it will also
[1:58:17] Quicken your mortal body
[1:58:19] get rid of all the stuff get rid of all
[1:58:22] the gossip get rid of talking about one
[1:58:24] another start believing God's word let
[1:58:27] the love of God be shed abroad in Your
[1:58:29] Heart by the Holy Spirit
[1:58:31] back to God's word
[1:58:36] back to Faith
[1:58:39] back to Faith
[1:58:41] not to reasoning back to believing
[1:58:45] I like what he said he says faith will
[1:58:48] let you believe for things that you
[1:58:50] can't hear smell touch see taste or seed
[1:58:54] it'll let make you do things you never
[1:58:56] thought you could even do
[1:59:02] we almost only believe God if the if he
[1:59:05] works through a doctor
[1:59:06] I believe in doctors
[1:59:09] go to a doctor I believe it but when
[1:59:11] that doctor says it's all over don't you
[1:59:14] let us in there
[1:59:17] sorry doc
[1:59:19] appreciate you
[1:59:21] you did all it all you could
[1:59:24] I thought I'd give you a try
[1:59:27] I know you got to make money you didn't
[1:59:29] do this Because You Loved Me
[1:59:31] you did it because my insurance company
[1:59:33] patient 10 times what you're worth but
[1:59:36] that's okay
[1:59:37] I'm all for you but I want to tell you
[1:59:40] one thing before I walk out the door
[1:59:41] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:59:44] and forever and by his stripes I am
[1:59:46] healed and and if if the skin worms eat
[1:59:50] my flesh yet I'll see God
[1:59:53] King live forever
[1:59:58] may you prosper and be in good health
[2:00:01] but I'm not going to duck but thou bound
[2:00:03] to that Idol and my God's more than able
[2:00:06] to save me but I still won't Bow Down
[2:00:09] Into the Fire they went
[2:00:13] oh we want the we want that Fourth Man
[2:00:16] to be there before the fire he's always
[2:00:19] in the fire he comes in the fire he
[2:00:22] comes in a pillar of fire he comes with
[2:00:25] a baptism of fire he's in the fire God's
[2:00:28] in the fire
[2:00:34] almost
[2:00:36] oh I just don't know how to say it
[2:00:38] sometimes we just get to thinking that
[2:00:39] the only Miracle is is it was when we
[2:00:42] don't have no trouble
[2:00:44] kind of Miracles that
[2:00:49] if he ain't after you he's got you
[2:00:54] if he ain't trying to steal your faith
[2:00:58] that means you ain't got no faith yeah
[2:01:00] he wants to steal your faith for your
[2:01:02] faith is his defeat he's defeated by
[2:01:06] your faith his plan is defeated his
[2:01:09] Kingdom's defeated everything's defeated
[2:01:12] by your faith
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:15] true
[2:01:16] oh I wish we could have a mind
[2:01:19] transplant
[2:01:22] I think I can get knees I can get hips
[2:01:27] you can get almost anything replaced
[2:01:29] right
[2:01:32] when we need is a heart replacement
[2:01:35] we need a mind replacement we need to go
[2:01:38] back to Faith
[2:01:39] how simple is faith
[2:01:42] what he said
[2:01:44] is the truth
[2:01:47] faith is given right
[2:01:50] right the reason he gave Faith The Sixth
[2:01:55] Sense for one reason and one reason only
[2:01:59] to deny
[2:02:02] everything that's contrary to the word
[2:02:07] of God
[2:02:10] I don't care if he's got a Roman collar
[2:02:13] on I don't care if he's got a PhD lld
[2:02:17] when I went up to Seeley Lake
[2:02:21] I remember when I sat there and talked
[2:02:23] to the general of the great Regional
[2:02:26] General thing of the Baptist church and
[2:02:29] we talked water baptism
[2:02:33] oh he's a doctor so and so
[2:02:36] and so but you know one thing Dr
[2:02:37] so-and-so couldn't do he couldn't find
[2:02:40] baptism in any other way than in the
[2:02:42] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[2:02:44] Bible
[2:02:47] oh he went to the Greek you know can he
[2:02:51] got this Greek scholar and before long
[2:02:53] he was he was quoting aristotles and and
[2:02:57] Apollo and all these unbelievers you
[2:03:01] know why wasn't the God's word
[2:03:03] right
[2:03:05] just hold them to God's word one name
[2:03:09] we're in a man to be saved
[2:03:12] one name one name
[2:03:15] there's no other name given under a
[2:03:17] heaven all things that you do do in the
[2:03:21] name of the Lord all things but water
[2:03:24] baptism
[2:03:31] you pray in his name
[2:03:34] you repent in his name
[2:03:36] but not that
[2:03:39] finally he got so frustrated he says
[2:03:41] well the bible really don't care how you
[2:03:42] baptize
[2:03:45] the Bible don't care
[2:03:49] that's exactly what you believe sir
[2:03:51] you need to be borned again you need to
[2:03:54] have the Holy Spirit
[2:04:00] faith
[2:04:03] it's faith
[2:04:06] if God be for you
[2:04:08] who can be against you
[2:04:14] the gift of God to you is faith
[2:04:19] he'd put a seed it's in you he give it
[2:04:23] to you he's given you something to
[2:04:25] believe with you're not going to get
[2:04:28] these people out here to believe that
[2:04:31] God's going to heal that God can deliver
[2:04:35] that's Supernatural things can happen
[2:04:38] that that things Beyond reasoning in
[2:04:41] fact if you even step out by faith they
[2:04:44] think you're a fool
[2:04:49] but faith is is a gift of God
[2:04:54] because Enoch
[2:04:57] had this testimony
[2:05:00] before he was translated he pleased God
[2:05:06] can Paul goes on to explain without
[2:05:09] faith it was impossible
[2:05:13] may I read it like this without faith it
[2:05:16] was impossible for Enoch to please God
[2:05:20] because Enoch believed that God was
[2:05:25] and a rewarder
[2:05:27] of him that diligently sought him
[2:05:31] yeah
[2:05:33] Church
[2:05:35] in your life
[2:05:37] in your prayer
[2:05:40] start building your faith
[2:05:43] you're not too old to believe you're not
[2:05:47] too young to Believe come back to Faith
[2:05:52] faith
[2:05:53] the statue of a perfect man is founded
[2:05:56] on faith
[2:05:58] faith
[2:05:59] believe
[2:06:01] what God's words whatever it is it is
[2:06:06] God's word doesn't
[2:06:09] need to be explained it wasn't written
[2:06:13] to be explained it was written to
[2:06:16] believe
[2:06:18] catch all God's word was written for it
[2:06:21] is to believe how is he going to do it I
[2:06:25] don't know
[2:06:27] when is he going to do it
[2:06:29] I don't know
[2:06:32] why is he going to do it
[2:06:34] I don't know but he said he was in that
[2:06:39] settles it
[2:06:42] have faith
[2:06:44] you believe also in God
[2:06:48] believe also in me Jesus said have
[2:06:53] faith
[2:06:55] Lord bless you this morning let's dance
[2:06:58] [Applause]
[2:07:09] let's don't be hearers of the word
[2:07:14] please don't be here as a word but let's
[2:07:16] be doers of the word
[2:07:20] doer of the word start believing
[2:07:23] start believing you got something in
[2:07:26] your life something in your heart you
[2:07:29] know you wouldn't even ask God to
[2:07:32] forgive you if you didn't believe him he
[2:07:35] wouldn't
[2:07:37] if you got a sin working in your life a
[2:07:40] sin that so easily beset you can't you
[2:07:43] believe he can deliver you from that
[2:07:46] the very fact that you know what's wrong
[2:07:48] right
[2:07:49] the very fact that you know that you
[2:07:52] have it that you're not doing right
[2:07:54] ought to be able to tell you I'm not
[2:07:55] doing right I need to be delivered how
[2:07:58] am I going to be delivered are you going
[2:08:00] to get a Deliverance program
[2:08:04] I'm not going to do this I'm not going
[2:08:06] to do that I'm not going to do this and
[2:08:09] then pretty soon he just tricks you
[2:08:10] right back into it and there you are
[2:08:12] doing it again you don't even know how
[2:08:14] you got there you know how you got there
[2:08:16] you never got healed
[2:08:20] you never asked him to heal you
[2:08:23] you never ask him to take it from you
[2:08:26] you never took your faith
[2:08:29] and took it from intellectual
[2:08:32] and take took it and attached it to a
[2:08:35] scripture
[2:08:38] you've got to take what you're believing
[2:08:41] for and attach it to a scripture
[2:08:44] you've got to have a he said
[2:08:47] he said
[2:08:50] when you have a he said
[2:08:53] there's one thing God can't do
[2:08:56] he can't lie
[2:08:58] in every good and perfect thing comes
[2:09:00] from him above
[2:09:01] so when you can take it and you can say
[2:09:04] when you can say you got a wayward loved
[2:09:07] one when you can take that Wayward love
[2:09:08] and then you can come back here and says
[2:09:10] God said to you give me my house
[2:09:13] [Music]
[2:09:15] when he said they let the unbelieving
[2:09:18] I might have a good conversation that
[2:09:20] she might win the unbelieving husband
[2:09:22] once you got word
[2:09:26] once you got word Heaven and Earth will
[2:09:29] pass away but my word won't pass away
[2:09:31] once you've got word
[2:09:35] that's the one thing Satan can't do
[2:09:38] even when Jesus he is tempted Jesus
[2:09:41] Jesus never come up with who he was
[2:09:44] he didn't need to he knew who he was but
[2:09:48] he knew what defeated Satan every time
[2:09:50] and it was the word he said it is
[2:09:53] written it is written it is written
[2:09:58] thank you
[2:10:00] I want to ask you this morning
[2:10:02] is your life attached to the word
[2:10:07] are you going to the word of God
[2:10:11] when that word speaks to your heart are
[2:10:13] you attaching your faith to it
[2:10:16] I said I believe this Lord
[2:10:18] I believe my healing I don't feel it I
[2:10:21] feel terrible I'm worse than I've ever
[2:10:23] been but you said
[2:10:26] but you said
[2:10:30] and I like that woman she says I'm going
[2:10:32] to believe it till I die
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:37] nothing's going to shake me
[2:10:40] he said so
[2:10:42] he said so
[2:10:44] that settled
[2:10:46] that's about our heads
[2:10:50] ask you this morning
[2:10:52] [Music]
[2:10:56] are you a little detached from God's
[2:10:58] word
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:04] maybe your faith
[2:11:07] isn't where you want it to be here
[2:11:09] [Music]
[2:11:10] maybe you just find it hard to believe
[2:11:13] because you're looking at all the
[2:11:15] symptoms you're looking at all the
[2:11:17] circumstances
[2:11:19] but if you could just Turn Your Eyes
[2:11:21] Upon Jesus and just say Lord You're the
[2:11:24] creator of Heaven and Earth
[2:11:28] and there's nothing you can't do
[2:11:32] and I want to believe you this morning
[2:11:36] I want a renewing of my faith
[2:11:39] I want to rededicate my life father to
[2:11:42] you this morning

[2:11:46] believed your word

[2:11:53] [Music]
[2:11:55] and that anything that's contrary to
[2:11:57] your word I call it is not so
[2:12:00] the only reality I have
[2:12:03] is your word
[2:12:06] perception is not a reality
[2:12:09] God's word is reality whether I see it
[2:12:12] whether I hear it whether I feel it
[2:12:14] whether I taste it whether I feel it
[2:12:16] doesn't matter
[2:12:17] Lord I want to believe what you said
[2:12:22] I want to hang on to it
[2:12:25] and I want to confess it
