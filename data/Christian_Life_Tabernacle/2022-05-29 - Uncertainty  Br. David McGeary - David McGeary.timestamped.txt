[19:08] this morning the promise will be with us
[19:11] even in us until the end
[19:13] amen but it's himself if i could just
[19:16] come and open our service in prayer and
[19:18] our song reading this morning certainly
[19:20] welcome everyone in the house of god in
[19:22] this memorial weekend god bless you
[19:28] good morning welcome to the house of the
[19:30] lord
[19:31] beautiful day that the lord has made
[19:33] [Music]
[19:35] david said we're going to rejoice and be
[19:37] glad in it amen be determined to rejoice
[19:40] and be glad
[19:42] i mean we're going to read out of psalm
[19:43] 149 we'll let brother mike continue the
[19:46] psalm 119 but
[19:50] you know i look at the congregation
[19:54] and there's nothing like the beauty of
[19:55] holiness
[19:57] a beautiful spring day we come together
[20:00] we lift up our voices together and
[20:02] praise the lord
[20:05] you know
[20:07] out of 150 psalms there's a lot of
[20:11] of exhortation and praise and
[20:14] and prayers
[20:16] uh supplications call upon the lord
[20:20] david
[20:22] and all his travails and victories
[20:25] the last five
[20:27] chapters
[20:30] from 146 on
[20:32] just giving over completely
[20:36] to praising the lord
[20:40] amen i think
[20:42] obviously the overcoming in our own
[20:44] lives
[20:45] the things we've gone through even in
[20:48] the midst of trial we want to praise the
[20:51] lord
[20:54] in verse 11 of 147
[20:58] said the lord taketh pleasure in them
[21:00] that fear him solomon said it's the fear
[21:03] of the lord
[21:05] that was the beginning of wisdom
[21:09] not to be afraid of the lord but to
[21:11] respect his holiness his righteousness
[21:16] so there's definitely a reverence that
[21:18] we apply we come to the house of the
[21:20] lord
[21:21] but there's also a freedom in worship
[21:23] and praise
[21:24] so this morning each of us in our own
[21:26] way
[21:27] let's lift up that name and praise
[21:30] glory
[21:31] he's kept us he's blessed us
[21:34] and above all
[21:35] people of this earth we've been blessed
[21:37] amen if you don't recognize that we pray
[21:39] that you have that recognition
[21:42] amen even this morning
[21:44] and i look out and you think
[21:47] uh
[21:49] i just considered this the lord just
[21:53] dealing with you in many ways
[21:56] you realize that
[21:57] you have children that are growing up
[22:00] you love to see them blessed
[22:02] you love to see victories
[22:05] if you look at verse 4
[22:10] so the lord taketh pleasure in his
[22:12] people
[22:14] you know as an earthly father or a dad
[22:17] you take pleasure in what your children
[22:19] accomplish even your friends children
[22:23] and uh
[22:25] we take pleasure in that but how much
[22:26] more a heavenly father
[22:29] realize that he's kept us he's blessed
[22:31] us
[22:32] but he has a desire for us to be an
[22:34] overcomer
[22:36] and
[22:39] i can ask how many uh probably over the
[22:41] age of 50 i'm sure know what uh pop
[22:44] bottle
[22:45] deposits are all about anybody remember
[22:48] that
[22:50] the young people probably don't but
[22:52] back in the day as they say uh
[22:56] the coke bottle we call them pop bottles
[22:58] in north arkansas was worth about 10
[23:01] cents
[23:03] and uh
[23:05] you know
[23:06] littering was a common thing back in
[23:08] that day people get finished one day
[23:10] just throw it out the window so as young
[23:12] kids barefoot
[23:14] many of us
[23:15] poor
[23:17] we could scour the ditches
[23:20] the dumps and everywhere else you could
[23:22] find them for those pop bottles and we
[23:24] can take them back to the store and
[23:26] we never got much money we got a lot of
[23:28] candy and a lot of baseball cards for
[23:30] them
[23:31] but uh as you come in the store if you
[23:33] were gonna buy a a six-pack
[23:35] you had to have your deposit with you
[23:37] you had to have your empty bottles back
[23:38] with you or you got charged 10 cents a
[23:40] bottle extra for your purchase
[23:43] so it made sense people would
[23:45] yeah there's my deposit right there and
[23:47] they take that off the price of your
[23:50] of your new purchase
[23:52] and you consider that and you realize
[23:53] there's a redemptive value in that model
[23:56] because it was cheaper for the company
[23:58] and think of this there's a type here
[24:00] they could clean that up and sanctify
[24:02] and purify purified and refill it
[24:05] cheaper than they can make a new one
[24:08] the lord didn't do that with us but
[24:10] there's a redemptive value in each one
[24:11] of us
[24:14] collectively
[24:15] consider the redemptive value of this
[24:17] assembly
[24:20] brother graham taught us that each soul
[24:22] is worth ten thousand worlds
[24:24] oh my the lord can take pleasure in this
[24:27] group this morning
[24:28] and say that's my beloved
[24:32] surely
[24:33] we can give him praise
[24:37] he's very deserving of it he like i said
[24:40] even in the midst of the trial
[24:42] he takes pleasure
[24:44] when you can lift your head say thank
[24:46] you lord
[24:48] so let's read one psalm 149 together
[24:52] you know
[24:54] and briefly
[24:56] the last verse of 150 says let
[24:58] everything that have breath praise the
[25:00] lord
[25:01] but if you'll notice
[25:02] back in 148
[25:05] praise them all you angels praise them
[25:07] all you host praise them sun and moon
[25:10] everything these things don't have life
[25:12] but they're still glorifying god the
[25:14] creator surely we that he has given life
[25:17] to
[25:18] we can praise him let's read together
[25:20] psalm 149
[25:21] praise ye the lord sing unto the lord a
[25:24] new song and his praise in the
[25:26] congregation of saints let israel
[25:29] rejoice in him that made him let the
[25:32] children of zion be joyful in their king
[25:35] let them praise his name in the dance
[25:37] let them sing praises unto him with the
[25:39] temple and heart for the lord taketh
[25:42] pleasure in his people he will beautify
[25:44] the meek with salvation let the saints
[25:47] be joyful and glory let them sing aloud
[25:50] upon their best let the high praises of
[25:53] god be in their mouth and a two-edged
[25:55] sword in their hand to execute vengeance
[25:58] upon the heathen and punishments upon
[26:01] the people to bind their kings with
[26:03] chains and their nobles with betters of
[26:05] mine to execute upon them the judgment
[26:08] written this honor have all his saints

[1:00:11] god bless you this morning let's open
[1:00:12] our bibles and
[1:00:20] turn to
[1:00:22] the book of the gospel of
[1:00:25] mark
[1:00:26] in the 13th chapter
[1:00:30] and we'd like to read
[1:00:38] the 29th
[1:00:39] 30th and 31st verse
[1:00:43] before we're seated this morning and
[1:00:44] have our bible
[1:00:48] lesson today
[1:00:50] we trust that
[1:00:56] we'll be able to put it together in a
[1:00:59] manner in which
[1:01:00] you can glean something from it that
[1:01:03] will bless your heart
[1:01:06] it says so
[1:01:07] ye
[1:01:08] in like manner
[1:01:11] when ye shall see these things come to
[1:01:14] pass
[1:01:16] know
[1:01:16] that
[1:01:17] it is nigh even at the door
[1:01:22] verily i send you
[1:01:24] that this generation shall not pass till
[1:01:28] these things be done
[1:01:30] heaven and earth
[1:01:32] shall pass away
[1:01:34] but my words shall not
[1:01:37] pass away
[1:01:39] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[1:01:41] word to us in jesus precious name we
[1:01:43] pray amen
[1:01:45] then you may be seated
[1:01:55] you know i i believe the desire
[1:01:59] of my heart as a pastor and i'm sure
[1:02:02] every pastor
[1:02:05] that
[1:02:06] uh
[1:02:08] approaches this congregation
[1:02:11] feels the same way
[1:02:13] but we want the best for each of you
[1:02:16] that's our heart's desire the best for
[1:02:20] each of you
[1:02:21] but as a church we
[1:02:23] certainly want the church to be all that
[1:02:26] it can be
[1:02:28] we want to live up to the full potential
[1:02:33] and the full
[1:02:36] expectation
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:39] god has for us
[1:02:41] i believe he's equipped this church to
[1:02:44] be the church that's prophesied
[1:02:46] that it would be
[1:02:48] amen do you believe that i believe that
[1:02:51] that we we're supposed to have
[1:02:53] in this day that there's supposed to be
[1:02:56] a church that has a book of acts
[1:02:59] written behind it
[1:03:01] there's supposed to be a body of
[1:03:03] believers
[1:03:04] that are empowered with the word of god
[1:03:09] in order to defeat the enemy on any
[1:03:12] ground
[1:03:13] any place any time and anywhere
[1:03:17] and we know that we're as even as the
[1:03:21] word of god tells us
[1:03:23] that we're approaching the end there's
[1:03:25] got to be the end the end of things many
[1:03:28] things are coming to an end
[1:03:31] and
[1:03:32] and we see those signs of it and so we
[1:03:35] want to uh
[1:03:37] pursue that
[1:03:39] path
[1:03:40] this morning but
[1:03:42] what
[1:03:43] in desiring that
[1:03:45] we achieve
[1:03:46] uh
[1:03:47] to a higher level
[1:03:49] it just came into my heart a little bit
[1:03:52] kind of like an automobile
[1:03:55] when an automobile isn't running to its
[1:03:59] uh
[1:04:01] perfection or it's running or
[1:04:03] something's wrong with it you know that
[1:04:05] it's not operating the way it should
[1:04:08] operate
[1:04:09] then what you do is you go back
[1:04:12] to the
[1:04:14] operation manual
[1:04:16] you know what i mean and uh you go
[1:04:19] search that out and you find out what
[1:04:22] are the causes of this problem
[1:04:25] what what what causes this
[1:04:28] to happen
[1:04:30] what causes a certain thing to happen
[1:04:34] and it doesn't matter where it is in the
[1:04:36] book some manuals are
[1:04:39] this
[1:04:40] thick and you go through that manual
[1:04:42] you'll go you just don't go to the back
[1:04:44] pages and read in the back pages you go
[1:04:47] to the place
[1:04:49] in the
[1:04:51] manual
[1:04:53] that describes the fix for the problem
[1:04:58] you understand what i'm saying
[1:05:00] so
[1:05:01] this morning i i i feel in my heart just
[1:05:05] looking how things are that
[1:05:09] uh
[1:05:10] what is what
[1:05:12] could it be
[1:05:14] that's keeping
[1:05:16] us from
[1:05:18] going to a higher level
[1:05:20] and i don't want to leave anybody behind
[1:05:22] you understand i don't want a small
[1:05:24] group of men or a small group of people
[1:05:27] that are all on fire for god that you're
[1:05:31] you're you just got this little burning
[1:05:34] bush i want the fire to be all through
[1:05:36] the church
[1:05:37] i want every believer to feel that
[1:05:40] they're a part of god i want every
[1:05:43] member to feel that they've got hope
[1:05:46] that they can touch the hem of his
[1:05:48] garment i want them to believe that
[1:05:50] there's a god that's standing with them
[1:05:52] that will fight for them and work for
[1:05:55] them so that our hearts desire is
[1:05:57] somehow
[1:05:59] to be all inclusive this morning to be
[1:06:02] able to gather everybody up and have
[1:06:05] them hear the word of god
[1:06:07] and find something in there that stirs
[1:06:10] their soul and moves them closer to the
[1:06:14] kingdom of god
[1:06:16] and
[1:06:17] and so going back and and i i just
[1:06:21] seeking the lord in my heart and he just
[1:06:24] seemed to lay this on my my heart and at
[1:06:27] the uh this certain uh
[1:06:30] sermon title and i went back and looked
[1:06:33] in it and i think within the framework
[1:06:35] of it
[1:06:36] i i found something
[1:06:39] and i'd like to share that
[1:06:42] with you
[1:06:43] this morning
[1:06:45] and
[1:06:47] and
[1:06:48] in the diagnosis
[1:06:51] of the
[1:06:52] of the problem the diagnosis was laid
[1:06:55] down early
[1:06:57] in in the message so we're going to go
[1:06:59] back this morning
[1:07:02] and we i want you to listen
[1:07:05] to 13 minutes
[1:07:08] of a sermon
[1:07:10] called the uncertain sound
[1:07:14] and it's preached in
[1:07:17] spokane washington
[1:07:19] and i'd encourage you to
[1:07:22] go back and
[1:07:24] maybe listen to it
[1:07:27] some time there's several he preached
[1:07:29] this message several times
[1:07:32] and usually when somebody is trying to
[1:07:34] preach something he's making an emphasis
[1:07:38] and to me it's kind of a turning
[1:07:41] a
[1:07:44] cornerstone kind of a turn where he's
[1:07:47] trying to present something to the
[1:07:49] church he's came out of the early stages
[1:07:52] of his ministry of
[1:07:55] taking people by the hands of discern he
[1:07:58] started the discerning the thoughts and
[1:08:00] intents of the heart and his message is
[1:08:02] moving now to the church trying to bring
[1:08:05] the church back into order
[1:08:08] that it can receive
[1:08:10] the word of god
[1:08:12] and then in listening to this i thought
[1:08:18] that
[1:08:22] it was like he led me to a place that's
[1:08:25] a beautiful description
[1:08:28] of exactly
[1:08:30] where
[1:08:31] we are
[1:08:32] as a country
[1:08:34] as a people
[1:08:36] and a lot of times as individuals
[1:08:40] so i don't know exactly how to approach
[1:08:43] this this morning what i want to bring
[1:08:45] but i thought maybe it would be best if
[1:08:49] we just listen to this 13 minutes
[1:08:52] now listen to this 13 minutes
[1:08:55] in light
[1:08:57] of not only what's happening in your
[1:09:00] personal lives
[1:09:04] but what's happening in this country
[1:09:07] the nation
[1:09:08] and the world
[1:09:13] i mean
[1:09:14] it's unbelievable
[1:09:18] to think
[1:09:20] what's transpiring
[1:09:23] many people are only concerned about
[1:09:27] their wallets and
[1:09:30] and
[1:09:32] and the fact that uh
[1:09:34] gas prices are so high and we all
[1:09:37] affected our our body of believers
[1:09:40] affects it i know what it's like when
[1:09:42] you put a dollar or two in the offering
[1:09:44] and it's so appreciated and now every
[1:09:47] dollar you have to go just
[1:09:50] goes in to get you to work and you don't
[1:09:53] have any leftover change you don't have
[1:09:56] those things we all suffer
[1:09:58] but we don't we don't mind the physical
[1:10:01] suffering
[1:10:02] we don't want to suffer spiritually
[1:10:06] we don't want to suffer spiritually
[1:10:09] because of the times that we're living
[1:10:12] in
[1:10:13] we want to be able to embrace those
[1:10:15] times we want to be able to understand
[1:10:17] the times we under we want to be able to
[1:10:20] recognize the day and the hour that
[1:10:23] we're living in and its message to us we
[1:10:27] want to be able to
[1:10:29] recognize the enemy at every single one
[1:10:33] of his tricks
[1:10:34] and we and by understanding what's
[1:10:38] happening and what he's trying to do to
[1:10:40] us
[1:10:41] then we can we can anchor in our place
[1:10:45] of rest
[1:10:46] and we can gain the victory
[1:10:49] so if our problem of god begins to speak
[1:10:53] to us
[1:10:55] and he began and we're just listening to
[1:10:57] 13 minutes of this this morning
[1:11:00] listen to the things that he's saying
[1:11:03] very carefully
[1:11:06] because he's talking about
[1:11:09] and he starts this off is he says
[1:11:12] now we're living in the day
[1:11:16] of uncertainty
[1:11:22] what
[1:11:23] a day
[1:11:25] and only a prophet
[1:11:27] can speak things you say well
[1:11:30] this was preached in 1960
[1:11:33] yeah i forgot when the prophet gave his
[1:11:36] prophecy a virgin shall conceive
[1:11:41] that was 400
[1:11:44] you know this is a few years
[1:11:47] 50 years later
[1:11:48] and it's so clear so may the word of god
[1:11:51] reach out to your heart
[1:11:54] this morning
[1:11:56] we're not here promoting a church we're
[1:11:59] not here promoting a system
[1:12:01] we're not even here promoting a profit
[1:12:06] we we read paul but we don't promote
[1:12:09] paul
[1:12:10] we read isaiah but we don't promote
[1:12:13] isaiah
[1:12:14] we read truth
[1:12:17] and we promote truth
[1:12:20] and that's all that i can ask you this
[1:12:22] morning is you listen to this
[1:12:24] you answer back to me
[1:12:26] is it the truth
[1:12:29] or not
[1:12:30] so let us just have a good sunday school
[1:12:32] lesson this morning amen do you love him
[1:12:36] i got something better than that
[1:12:38] he loved you first
[1:12:41] god bless you let's listen to 13 minutes
[1:12:44] let it be a blessing to you god bless
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:48] now
[1:12:49] we live in a day of uncertainty
[1:12:56] it's an uncertain time
[1:12:59] now i want to ask you something and as
[1:13:01] we i try to teach just for a moment and
[1:13:04] refer to these contexts
[1:13:07] here in scriptures
[1:13:09] i'd like to ask you anything that's
[1:13:12] uncertain cannot be trusted
[1:13:16] if it's uncertain
[1:13:19] you can't trust it
[1:13:21] paul said you're if the trumpet gives an
[1:13:23] uncertain sound
[1:13:25] how shall we prepare ourselves for
[1:13:27] battle
[1:13:29] now
[1:13:31] uncertainty
[1:13:32] there never was a time that things were
[1:13:34] so uncertain as today
[1:13:37] and anything that's uncertain cannot be
[1:13:40] trusted
[1:13:41] just remember that
[1:13:43] anything that's uncertain cannot be
[1:13:46] trusted
[1:13:47] if there's a question don't do it at all
[1:13:52] a lady come to me not long ago a woman
[1:13:54] on my own church young girl
[1:13:58] and she said to me they got some kind of
[1:14:00] a fashion out about girls wearing
[1:14:02] scandal skirts or something that showed
[1:14:04] the little piece up cut up like this
[1:14:06] that wore a shoulder underneath skirt
[1:14:08] and she said brother branham do you
[1:14:10] think it's wrong for us christian girls
[1:14:12] to wear a scandal skirts
[1:14:14] i said well you asked me that far
[1:14:16] she said i was just wondering i said if
[1:14:18] you question your mind don't do it
[1:14:21] i said if this question leave it alone
[1:14:23] you can't be certain
[1:14:25] dress the way you know you're certain
[1:14:27] don't take any chance i said by the way
[1:14:29] what would a that's what is a scandal
[1:14:31] skirt i didn't know what she was talking
[1:14:33] about and she told me what it was and i
[1:14:35] said what in the world would a christian
[1:14:37] girl want to show an underskirt for i
[1:14:38] can't understand
[1:14:40] that's right i just can't get that my
[1:14:42] mind don't make sense to me
[1:14:44] christ is our life
[1:14:46] all right
[1:14:48] now
[1:14:49] but if there's a question man come say
[1:14:51] do you think it's wrong to smoke what
[1:14:53] are you asking about it for if it's
[1:14:54] questioning your mind leave it alone
[1:14:57] or anything you don't do by faith is sin
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:01] you've got to be the face of how can you
[1:15:03] smoke and have faith
[1:15:06] write your own conscience shows you that
[1:15:08] you're wrong
[1:15:10] so if it's uncertain you better leave it
[1:15:11] alone because that might be the one
[1:15:14] thing that keeps you out of the kingdom
[1:15:15] of god
[1:15:16] or you say brother brown one little
[1:15:18] thing like that
[1:15:19] one little thing like that will do it
[1:15:21] just disobeying one commandment of god
[1:15:24] one little disobedient one commandment
[1:15:26] caused all sickness and look
[1:15:29] jesus said in his own texts and his
[1:15:31] sermon remember lots wise
[1:15:35] now she had a lot more uh excuse
[1:15:40] than what we have today doing the things
[1:15:42] that we do
[1:15:44] that woman's children and grandchildren
[1:15:46] was burning up in the fires of hell
[1:15:48] sent down from god and the poor thing
[1:15:51] screaming and crying going up there and
[1:15:53] she merely turned to look back and she
[1:15:54] turned to a pillar of salt and stands
[1:15:56] there yet today
[1:15:58] and jesus said remember lost white
[1:16:02] we've got to keep every word of god amen
[1:16:06] just one little thing
[1:16:08] that's reason sometimes people think i
[1:16:10] i get rough with people bawling out it's
[1:16:12] not because i don't love this because i
[1:16:14] do love you
[1:16:16] what if your little boy sitting out the
[1:16:17] street you said junior dear uh uh you
[1:16:21] shouldn't sit out there daddy don't want
[1:16:23] the
[1:16:24] you better strip the hot off of him if
[1:16:26] you love him
[1:16:27] keep him in off of that street
[1:16:30] real love is corrective
[1:16:32] genuine love is corrected
[1:16:35] what if your wife is running out of
[1:16:36] somebody man you say dear i hope you
[1:16:38] have a good time but really i don't
[1:16:40] think you should do
[1:16:42] she already kicked you out the door
[1:16:46] yeah
[1:16:47] real love is corrective
[1:16:49] that's right
[1:16:51] now
[1:16:52] uncertainty
[1:16:54] the american home today is uncertain
[1:16:58] a man marrying a wife it sure is a
[1:17:00] problem
[1:17:02] certainly is a woman marrying a man
[1:17:05] it's certainly on certain things they
[1:17:08] even got it in the marriage ceremony now
[1:17:10] i'll take him for better or worse
[1:17:13] there's a question on it uncertain be
[1:17:16] good to pray through on it don't you
[1:17:17] think so
[1:17:18] i think that would be better
[1:17:20] pray through
[1:17:22] but it's uncertain
[1:17:25] homes are broke up
[1:17:26] remarriage constantly all the time
[1:17:30] uncertainty of home life
[1:17:33] america leads the world in divorce cases
[1:17:35] all the rest of the world america leads
[1:17:37] it
[1:17:38] business
[1:17:40] uncertainty in business you don't know
[1:17:42] whether to start a business or not
[1:17:44] there's so much competition there's so
[1:17:46] much everything you don't know whether
[1:17:48] to start or not it's kind of
[1:17:49] questionable
[1:17:51] another thing
[1:17:53] is
[1:17:54] national life
[1:17:56] we don't know where to build a home or
[1:17:57] not
[1:17:59] might be blow up before morning
[1:18:01] you can't tell
[1:18:03] russia's standing there they got a
[1:18:06] uh a bunch of missiles set the only
[1:18:08] thing they don't need an army just one
[1:18:10] man with a little too much vodka to pull
[1:18:12] a line and we go to dusk
[1:18:15] no way he got set on everywhere
[1:18:18] that's all and remember we've got it for
[1:18:19] them the same way
[1:18:22] every little island every little
[1:18:23] nation's got us
[1:18:24] they don't have to fight any more wars
[1:18:26] just press the trigger
[1:18:28] and they'd stand enough bombs across
[1:18:30] your there'd be no way of stopping it
[1:18:33] you can't get away from it
[1:18:34] they'll blow a hole in the ground they
[1:18:36] got them hydrogen bombs that'll blow a
[1:18:38] hole around 150 yards deep i believe it
[1:18:41] is 150 miles square
[1:18:44] how would you ever get away from it the
[1:18:45] thousands of them set to explode at one
[1:18:47] time
[1:18:48] the world couldn't stand it
[1:18:50] and we roll there and hold up our fists
[1:18:52] they run back this way and run back is
[1:18:54] scared every nation is scared
[1:18:56] might as well like the white house we're
[1:18:58] like a little boy in the night time
[1:19:00] passing the graveyard whistling in the
[1:19:02] dark
[1:19:03] acting like we're big and brave but all
[1:19:05] behind everybody's shaking in his boots
[1:19:08] it's uncertain
[1:19:11] right
[1:19:12] our nation's treaty of pieces and
[1:19:13] everything else this is shaking the um's
[1:19:16] are shaking everything's shaking
[1:19:19] the bible said it would
[1:19:21] everything that could be shucked would
[1:19:23] be shut but we receive a kingdom it
[1:19:25] cannot be shown
[1:19:26] [Music]
[1:19:29] everything's shaking it's uncertain
[1:19:32] the seasons are uncertain
[1:19:34] you don't know where to plant your crops
[1:19:36] you haven't got some kind of irrigation
[1:19:38] the season's so irregular
[1:19:41] frost rain anything else can happen
[1:19:42] right in the summertime look uh once
[1:19:45] sometime here is having a freeze down in
[1:19:46] florida last year and a heat wave in
[1:19:48] alaska
[1:19:50] uncertain science says the earth is
[1:19:53] pushed out i forget how many miles is
[1:19:55] pushed out around the earth swelling out
[1:19:57] in the middle
[1:19:58] finland is almost one third or
[1:20:01] one-eighth bigger than it used to be a
[1:20:02] few years ago it's raising up
[1:20:05] the middle of the earth's are pushing
[1:20:07] out
[1:20:08] oh brother
[1:20:10] what is it
[1:20:12] the
[1:20:12] the red signals down he's coming
[1:20:16] be ready amen
[1:20:18] she's right at the door
[1:20:21] you don't know where to go to find
[1:20:23] security
[1:20:25] you buy life insurance how you know he's
[1:20:27] going to be any life from here after
[1:20:30] how you do you do you do everything
[1:20:32] but it's also just a gamma right so
[1:20:35] uncertain
[1:20:37] church life is uncertain
[1:20:39] churches denominations are so uncertain
[1:20:43] one don't know what to do with the other
[1:20:45] they're so uncertain until they're
[1:20:47] bumming themselves all together and
[1:20:48] going into the world council churches
[1:20:51] how are you going to do that when you
[1:20:52] mix yourself up with believers make
[1:20:55] believers and unbelievers
[1:20:58] people who deny the virgin birth deny
[1:21:00] the baptist the holy ghost deny divine
[1:21:01] healing and everything and yoking
[1:21:03] yourself up amongst unbelievers
[1:21:05] trying to do it for security
[1:21:07] security
[1:21:09] you know the bible said let the wheat
[1:21:10] and terrors grow together and he would
[1:21:12] funnel up the terriers at the end they
[1:21:15] are
[1:21:16] they're getting bundled up in one great
[1:21:17] big bunch
[1:21:18] all of them coming together to form the
[1:21:20] image of the beast
[1:21:22] an ecclesiastical power an image like
[1:21:25] rome
[1:21:26] oh it's coming don't you wear it it's
[1:21:28] going to be here and you're going to see
[1:21:30] it if you won't die at all age and none
[1:21:31] of you don't think till you'll see it we
[1:21:33] got the head of it sitting here now
[1:21:34] jezebel turning over ahab's neck and
[1:21:37] remember the days of that don't you
[1:21:40] i never heard my tape on jezebel
[1:21:42] religion
[1:21:43] scatters a whole lot you know what i'm
[1:21:44] talking about
[1:21:46] all right
[1:21:47] now
[1:21:48] uncertainty church life people belonging
[1:21:50] to church they're so uncertain they'll
[1:21:52] join the methodist this week is this it
[1:21:54] they're going to join the baptist next
[1:21:56] week go back to this and finally wind up
[1:21:57] in the catholic that's right uncertain
[1:22:00] they don't know where to go catholics
[1:22:02] running here and there and everything
[1:22:03] else nobody knows what to do
[1:22:05] just uncertainty
[1:22:07] whole thing it seems to be crumb
[1:22:09] no foundation
[1:22:10] but is there anything that's certain yes
[1:22:15] hallelujah
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:18] is there something
[1:22:21] sure
[1:22:22] yes jesus said both heavens and earth
[1:22:26] will pass away but my words shall never
[1:22:29] there's something that's certain
[1:22:34] yes sir
[1:22:35] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:22:37] word shall not pass away
[1:22:40] then that's certain
[1:22:42] one thing sure that god's word will
[1:22:45] never fail
[1:22:47] no matter how critical critics might
[1:22:50] criticize it how uh educationals might
[1:22:53] explain it away
[1:22:55] how they might do this that other but it
[1:22:57] won't stop it one bit it'll happen just
[1:22:59] the same as john said god's label these
[1:23:02] stones right children abraham
[1:23:04] god's going to do it his words are going
[1:23:05] to be fulfilled in their season and
[1:23:07] nothing's going to stop it
[1:23:09] i'm so glad of that oh how glad i am
[1:23:13] paul here was talking in corinthians 14
[1:23:17] 8 of training
[1:23:19] a soldier
[1:23:21] he's trained to a sound
[1:23:24] that soldier if he's a trained soldier
[1:23:27] he knows every sound of that trumpet
[1:23:30] just exactly what to do
[1:23:33] he's trained to that trumpet when that
[1:23:36] trumpet sound he said if the trumpet
[1:23:37] gives an uncertain sound then the
[1:23:40] soldier don't know what to do
[1:23:41] because he's only trained to the sound
[1:23:44] of the trumpet
[1:23:46] he knows exactly what to do because the
[1:23:49] trumpet sounded tells him what to do
[1:23:52] he said now the trumpet gives an
[1:23:54] uncertain sound
[1:23:56] then
[1:23:57] uh you don't know what to do
[1:23:59] now that was training a natural soldier
[1:24:02] and the christian soldier is trained to
[1:24:05] a trumpet
[1:24:07] a sound of a trumpet and that's the
[1:24:09] gospel trumpet
[1:24:11] the gospel the sound of the word of god
[1:24:14] the gospel trumpet
[1:24:16] and
[1:24:18] if one never knew the sound of the
[1:24:20] gospel trumpet he'd be a bit confused
[1:24:23] if he didn't know what the word said and
[1:24:25] what the word taught just what the
[1:24:26] church said he'd be a bit confused when
[1:24:28] he heard the sound of the trumpet
[1:24:32] he wouldn't know how to prepare himself
[1:24:35] and i think that's where we've got to
[1:24:38] the world today
[1:24:40] the trumpet is sounding
[1:24:42] exactly with the gospel and the people
[1:24:45] don't know how to act amen
[1:24:48] they don't know how to stand in line
[1:24:51] and make ready the battle
[1:24:54] they're confused
[1:24:56] because they have been listening to
[1:24:58] different trumpets
[1:25:01] creed
[1:25:02] denominations
[1:25:04] sectarianism
[1:25:06] all kinds of stuff
[1:25:08] and when the true gospel with the true
[1:25:11] word made manifest proved in that of
[1:25:13] people don't know what to do
[1:25:16] someone walks back and says it's it's a
[1:25:18] devil
[1:25:19] the other says
[1:25:20] it's uh telepathy it's um they're
[1:25:23] excited there's no such thing as the
[1:25:25] holy ghost dr so-and-so said so i don't
[1:25:27] care what dr so-and-so said what's the
[1:25:29] god saying that's the only thing it's
[1:25:31] solid his words will fail but god's word
[1:25:33] will never pass away
[1:25:37] this word's uncertain but god's word
[1:25:39] sure
[1:25:40] that's the reason i build my hopes on
[1:25:42] nothing less
[1:25:44] than that bible
[1:25:48] it's got to be that
[1:25:49] but it's strange
[1:25:51] as i go
[1:25:52] about and preach the word
[1:25:56] and testify that he's maybe taking a
[1:25:58] simple thing
[1:25:59] one statement of the bible
[1:26:02] use it's better to do that
[1:26:04] i could stand here for weeks and go a
[1:26:06] few things to show you that the
[1:26:08] scripture pointing right to this time
[1:26:11] and they don't believe it
[1:26:18] don't be mad at me you can go home and
[1:26:20] pick it up
[1:26:22] and
[1:26:23] keep listening
[1:26:26] makes you just want to keep listening
[1:26:28] doesn't
[1:26:29] because it's truth
[1:26:31] it's truth
[1:26:33] and
[1:26:34] so we want to approach this
[1:26:37] this morning and uh
[1:26:41] and so
[1:26:43] if you could
[1:26:44] see what the prophet of god saying
[1:26:47] uncertainty
[1:26:49] is a problem
[1:26:52] uncertainty is a problem
[1:26:55] and he said that in a battle and in a
[1:26:58] war
[1:26:59] and especially in those times that's how
[1:27:01] they communicated now today we would
[1:27:04] have a radio signal or we would have
[1:27:06] something that we would call out
[1:27:09] but before everything acted upon the
[1:27:12] trumpet
[1:27:13] and we even know scripturally that we're
[1:27:16] taught that the trump of god shall sound
[1:27:20] that is a
[1:27:21] that is a sign of the end
[1:27:24] the the trump of god
[1:27:26] uh sounding and so we as we listened and
[1:27:30] as we saw we saw that
[1:27:34] the reason
[1:27:36] that
[1:27:37] people are in the condition
[1:27:40] that they're in
[1:27:41] is because there is uncertainty
[1:27:46] uncertainty
[1:27:48] act and they don't know how to act
[1:27:51] and there's reasons for uncertainty
[1:27:55] there's things that cause uncertainty so
[1:27:58] if uncertainties the problem
[1:28:01] and and
[1:28:03] i feel that so many people
[1:28:06] are
[1:28:07] in this condition
[1:28:10] because that's what they're trying to do
[1:28:13] is the world is trying to create an
[1:28:16] uncertainty
[1:28:17] satan is trying to create uncertainty
[1:28:20] he's setting himself up
[1:28:22] people are uncertain about politics
[1:28:25] they're uncertain about uh we're
[1:28:27] uncertain about energy
[1:28:30] hey you know they're trying to say well
[1:28:31] gas price is so high we we have to turn
[1:28:35] the whole world over to a battery
[1:28:37] well i'm not ready to trust in the
[1:28:39] battery i don't know about anybody else
[1:28:45] and very you know i was thinking the
[1:28:47] other day i made the most stupid
[1:28:48] statement out of my mouth but i believe
[1:28:51] that god allowed me to to make that
[1:28:53] statement is i asked and they said we
[1:28:56] got an electric car
[1:28:58] and everything and i i said well will it
[1:29:01] charge itself while it's running
[1:29:05] well everybody knows that's called you
[1:29:07] know that's called perpetual energy
[1:29:10] there's no such thing
[1:29:13] so they're gonna it i'm just talking
[1:29:16] about the failure of man's mind
[1:29:20] okay so they're gonna they're gonna have
[1:29:22] batteries well you got to charge
[1:29:24] batteries
[1:29:26] you can't charge batteries with
[1:29:28] batteries
[1:29:29] so they're going to have to create
[1:29:31] energy somewhere to charge the battery
[1:29:35] so they're going to have to have nuclear
[1:29:36] plants or big coal plants or big gas
[1:29:40] plants or natural so instead of coming
[1:29:42] in out of your car it's going to come
[1:29:44] out of the manufacturer that's producing
[1:29:47] it
[1:29:51] what are they trying to create
[1:29:53] uncertainty
[1:29:57] because where there's uncertainty you
[1:29:59] can be sold
[1:30:06] oh this morning i i want
[1:30:10] is i want to get rid of my uncertainty
[1:30:13] yes sir and if i can help you with your
[1:30:16] uncertainty
[1:30:18] that's what i want to do today
[1:30:29] he says we know every scripture has a
[1:30:31] compound answer to it repeats itself
[1:30:35] certainly it does
[1:30:37] and we're in the day
[1:30:39] how we could take hours on that and show
[1:30:42] you just exactly the truth
[1:30:44] and you can't explain it to people
[1:30:47] and show it to people and they don't
[1:30:49] know which way to go
[1:30:56] that's uncertainty
[1:30:59] that's where he wants to get you into a
[1:31:01] place
[1:31:03] where you don't know which way to go
[1:31:06] he's trying to cause uncertainty satan
[1:31:09] is the author of confusion
[1:31:12] confusion is an attribute of uncertainty
[1:31:17] he that what he is wanting to do
[1:31:20] he says
[1:31:22] he says i'm one and one way you feel
[1:31:24] like you want to scold them
[1:31:27] yet you're sorry for them because
[1:31:29] they've been listening to something else
[1:31:32] that's contrary
[1:31:35] but always come back to see if it's thus
[1:31:38] saith the lord
[1:31:40] if it's the bible then that's certain
[1:31:45] and every ounce of it is certain
[1:31:49] not even one little phrase will ever
[1:31:52] fail
[1:31:54] as much as lot's wife
[1:31:57] right so like he said he said uh
[1:32:03] lot's wife
[1:32:04] would turn her head
[1:32:06] at her own screaming children and
[1:32:08] grandchildren burning up in flames of
[1:32:11] hell god's wrath and judgment poured
[1:32:13] upon sodom and and the poor little
[1:32:15] grieving mother just turned her head
[1:32:20] just think of that
[1:32:23] that that's that's the thing he
[1:32:26] he's saying just turned her head to look
[1:32:28] back but the angel said the angel
[1:32:32] messenger of the hour
[1:32:33] to their people said don't even look
[1:32:36] back and she disobeyed the messenger and
[1:32:38] just turned her head and she stands
[1:32:41] yesterday see friends that's the trouble
[1:32:45] i've noticed it amongst our people we
[1:32:49] just don't have the sincerity
[1:32:52] the reverence and respect to that word
[1:32:56] that we should have
[1:33:03] and that's the only thing that's going
[1:33:05] to stand
[1:33:06] is that word
[1:33:10] so
[1:33:11] that you understand that's what
[1:33:12] uncertainty does
[1:33:16] that you don't have the reverence
[1:33:18] you don't have the
[1:33:20] respect now because this is the argument
[1:33:23] of society today well that's not fair
[1:33:28] her babies were crying what did you
[1:33:31] expect her to do
[1:33:38] god expects you to obey his word
[1:33:44] he's the supreme authority
[1:33:48] but we don't have that respect we don't
[1:33:50] have what he says we don't have the
[1:33:52] sincerity we don't have the respect for
[1:33:56] the word you see say just trying to wash
[1:33:59] it down that's why all these people
[1:34:01] jumped up everywhere and started walking
[1:34:03] away from this message what were they
[1:34:05] trying to do they were trying to cause
[1:34:07] an uncertainty uncertainty breeds
[1:34:10] uncertainty doubt brings doubt
[1:34:13] don't even hang around with people that
[1:34:16] aren't certain of what they stand for
[1:34:23] but uncertainty
[1:34:28] that's what they do he says
[1:34:30] now
[1:34:33] and
[1:34:34] it and it it it shows that
[1:34:37] that they they were taught something
[1:34:40] they had something that was uncertain
[1:34:42] they didn't have a certain sound
[1:34:46] you know something that
[1:34:48] they they couldn't recognize
[1:34:51] the sound of the trumpet
[1:34:55] well in our day
[1:34:58] shouldn't we by now
[1:35:01] recognize the sound of the trumpet
[1:35:05] here everybody's sitting in uncertainty
[1:35:08] we don't know what what's going on
[1:35:11] nobody knows what's going on
[1:35:16] they're afraid the stock market's going
[1:35:17] to fall apart they're afraid that uh
[1:35:21] did he said it businesses are uncertain
[1:35:23] they don't know whether to start a
[1:35:24] business or not they don't know where to
[1:35:27] invest their money they don't know like
[1:35:28] that everybody's guessing
[1:35:33] because things are uncertain
[1:35:36] now we're talking we're not talking
[1:35:38] we're saying we're looking at the
[1:35:40] uncertainty
[1:35:43] and i hope that i can express this to
[1:35:45] you and try to sum it all in there but
[1:35:48] the church is going to be the church
[1:35:50] that it's going to be
[1:35:52] with power and demonstration that it's
[1:35:54] going to present because it's going to
[1:35:56] be the only certain voice in an
[1:36:00] uncertain time
[1:36:07] i don't care what disease they come up
[1:36:09] with
[1:36:10] somebody's talking about monkey pox or
[1:36:13] something now i heard the other day
[1:36:15] monkey pops chicken pox dog pops pig pox
[1:36:19] i don't care what it is there's still
[1:36:21] one certain
[1:36:23] by the stripes we are healed that's
[1:36:26] certain
[1:36:32] there's only one thing that's certain
[1:36:36] and that's god's word
[1:36:40] so you have to understand
[1:36:43] that if everything's uncertain
[1:36:46] that which is certain
[1:36:50] that which is certain
[1:36:54] that's what's going to stand true
[1:36:59] that's what people are looking at
[1:37:02] how can you say today
[1:37:05] certain when you got this church on the
[1:37:08] corner but teaching this one thing in
[1:37:10] this other church over here teaching
[1:37:12] this thing christianity is one of the
[1:37:14] most uncertain things you can possibly
[1:37:18] view if you're sitting on the outside
[1:37:21] looking in
[1:37:27] everybody's got a different idea
[1:37:29] everybody's got a different this prophet
[1:37:31] of god said its flavors is all it
[1:37:33] amounts to
[1:37:36] everybody's got a flavor
[1:37:38] what flavor do you want
[1:37:40] how do you want it
[1:37:43] it's called what a church
[1:37:46] just the way you want it
[1:37:48] drive up order your religion just the
[1:37:51] way you want it
[1:37:53] there's no certainty in that
[1:37:55] i want something that's certain i want
[1:37:58] something i know if i take this path i'm
[1:38:01] going to glory
[1:38:03] i want to have something that's real i
[1:38:05] want to have something that's genuine i
[1:38:07] want to have something that's positive i
[1:38:09] want to be certain of god
[1:38:14] and he's telling us
[1:38:16] there's one thing you can be certain of
[1:38:18] and that's my word
[1:38:22] this is what will remain
[1:38:25] i don't care how they paint it i don't
[1:38:27] care how they twist it what was truth in
[1:38:30] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:38:33] was with god and the word was god
[1:38:39] that's the thing
[1:38:40] that's the word what do you anchor to
[1:38:42] what have you attached yourself to what
[1:38:45] is it that you're getting your advice
[1:38:47] from
[1:38:51] he said that's the problem
[1:38:54] they didn't know the sound of the
[1:38:55] trumpet
[1:38:58] they didn't know the sound of the voice
[1:39:01] the voice won't stand up merely mining
[1:39:05] backslid preachers won't stand up
[1:39:07] against the spirit of sodom and gomorrah
[1:39:09] this day that homosexuality is of the
[1:39:12] devil it's a spirit that can be cast off
[1:39:16] a man or a woman
[1:39:22] what kind of voice is you getting today
[1:39:24] on that
[1:39:26] i don't care
[1:39:28] you kids in school you may have a friend
[1:39:31] you love her she's a good friend she's
[1:39:33] your best friend and one day she says
[1:39:36] well i don't know whether i'm gay or not
[1:39:42] you might laugh at it
[1:39:44] but there's guys
[1:39:47] in this building
[1:39:48] right here
[1:39:50] that are suffering with the same
[1:39:52] question
[1:39:59] you know it's true on the outside too
[1:40:04] lack of sincerity
[1:40:08] lack of commitment
[1:40:11] lack of an absolute
[1:40:16] voices
[1:40:20] what they did they've listened to an
[1:40:21] uncertain voice
[1:40:24] they're not certain of what they say why
[1:40:26] they have to they have to have a way out
[1:40:30] why because they don't know whether
[1:40:31] they're right or not
[1:40:34] it's the truth
[1:40:37] that's the truth
[1:40:41] they just they're just not
[1:40:43] they they just don't know
[1:40:44] what the voice is he says
[1:40:47] now if they doesn't know the sound of
[1:40:49] the trumpet doesn't know what he's
[1:40:51] talking about
[1:40:54] then he's a bit confused
[1:40:56] now today we find people confused look
[1:40:59] here presbyterians episcopalians
[1:41:02] lutherans
[1:41:03] by the hundred just coming and seeking
[1:41:05] the holy ghost
[1:41:07] that's right hundreds and hundreds
[1:41:10] denominational people coming up seeking
[1:41:13] the holy ghost and the pentecostal
[1:41:15] people they ought to know what's
[1:41:18] happening
[1:41:20] doesn't do it
[1:41:21] instead of grabbing and holding their
[1:41:24] congregations and shaking them down to
[1:41:27] the gospel they let them go right on
[1:41:30] living as luxurious as they want to
[1:41:36] when they don't know jesus said
[1:41:38] the sleeping virgin's coming to buy oil
[1:41:43] hundreds of people
[1:41:45] are seeking the holy ghost
[1:41:49] but you know why they can't bring them
[1:41:51] to the altar
[1:41:54] you know why they can't lead them to
[1:41:56] where the whole the fountain is
[1:41:58] you know why they can't share the
[1:42:00] experience because they're not certain
[1:42:02] themselves whether they got it they're
[1:42:04] relying on some kind of man-made
[1:42:06] evidence that they spoke in tongues and
[1:42:09] they know they spoke in tongues and they
[1:42:11] know they don't have power over the
[1:42:13] devil they know they can't lay their
[1:42:15] hands on the sick and they recover they
[1:42:17] know they don't got one ounce of
[1:42:19] anything but intellect
[1:42:23] because they haven't had a genuine
[1:42:26] born-again experience
[1:42:28] what is the holy ghost it's the change
[1:42:30] of your nature
[1:42:36] i wasn't free from temptation when i got
[1:42:39] saved
[1:42:42] i was still tempted in the flesh he was
[1:42:45] tempted in the flesh just like we are
[1:42:47] but i know one thing
[1:42:50] before i'd have stabbed you and took
[1:42:52] your wallet before i helped you up off
[1:42:55] the ground
[1:42:57] you brother mcgeary yeah
[1:43:00] praise god that guy's dead
[1:43:06] i didn't care about nobody but
[1:43:08] me and i wasn't sure about me
[1:43:16] think of it
[1:43:20] voices everywhere
[1:43:24] they don't know they don't know what
[1:43:26] what's happening they can't they can't
[1:43:28] bring them to a real experience
[1:43:31] so what are you gonna do if you're
[1:43:32] uncertain
[1:43:34] how are you gonna bring them to your
[1:43:36] uncertainty
[1:43:42] if we want to rise up
[1:43:45] if we want to be the church of the
[1:43:47] living god
[1:43:49] if we're going to if we're going to make
[1:43:51] good on our claim
[1:43:53] realize everybody that's sitting in here
[1:43:56] has made a claim
[1:43:57] i am the bride of jesus christ that's
[1:44:01] pretty heavy friend
[1:44:07] i'd rather have you honest i ain't no
[1:44:09] bride i'm here because if i don't come
[1:44:11] to church mama won't let me drive the
[1:44:12] car
[1:44:13] praise god that's the kind of people i
[1:44:15] like
[1:44:19] there are this local football team
[1:44:22] over here that claims they're america's
[1:44:25] team and hadn't won a game and i don't
[1:44:27] know many how many years
[1:44:29] but they had a coach one time i didn't
[1:44:31] like that coach
[1:44:34] he you know he took over tom landry's
[1:44:36] job i didn't like him i just thought he
[1:44:38] was
[1:44:39] phony as all get out and one day
[1:44:41] he made a statement and since he made
[1:44:44] that statement i like that man every day
[1:44:46] of his life he said i sold my soul for
[1:44:48] football i said amen
[1:44:51] that's the kind of man i like at least
[1:44:53] he knows he's going to hell
[1:45:01] right he stood for something
[1:45:04] there's no uncertainty in his life he
[1:45:07] was certain
[1:45:09] that he was gonna live eat and drink
[1:45:12] football
[1:45:14] all the days of his life
[1:45:17] make my coffin like a football
[1:45:21] good for him
[1:45:24] god
[1:45:25] you know gotta have more merciful on
[1:45:28] him then he would some lukewarm backbone
[1:45:33] person
[1:45:35] that's ashamed of the gospel
[1:45:38] that's what he said paul said i'm not
[1:45:40] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:45:42] because it's the power of god unto
[1:45:44] salvation why there was one thing that
[1:45:47] paul lived for he said i've fought a
[1:45:49] good fight i've ran a good race now i'm
[1:45:52] looking to receive the crown that's laid
[1:45:55] up for me in glory he knew where he was
[1:45:57] going he was certain what he was living
[1:46:00] for
[1:46:02] no uncertainty in his life
[1:46:09] even the prophet
[1:46:11] when he went before israel
[1:46:14] he looked out at israel and his spirit
[1:46:17] was so disturbed he said why halt you
[1:46:21] between two opinions
[1:46:23] choose this day
[1:46:24] whom you're gonna serve as for me and my
[1:46:28] house we're gonna serve the lord god of
[1:46:31] israel
[1:46:34] how long are you gonna be halted between
[1:46:36] two opinions
[1:46:43] people are hauled because they don't
[1:46:44] know the sound
[1:46:47] there's a sound
[1:46:49] a trumpet
[1:46:50] was sounded
[1:46:54] to let us know that
[1:46:57] where we were and
[1:46:58] and
[1:46:59] what the hour is that we're living in
[1:47:02] if it was sounded
[1:47:04] can you say well
[1:47:06] it was it was that just brother branham
[1:47:09] was he's the trump of god he was the
[1:47:11] voice of the trumpet
[1:47:14] amen
[1:47:16] you understand the word was the trumpet
[1:47:20] but he was the voice of the trumpet but
[1:47:23] even if you didn't hear
[1:47:27] the trumpet is sounding many other
[1:47:29] places too
[1:47:34] it's sounding in society
[1:47:36] what do you think happened in avaldo
[1:47:39] texas
[1:47:40] that was the trump of god
[1:47:45] sounding out to this nation
[1:47:48] you've turned from god
[1:47:53] that's what happens when you turn for
[1:47:54] god
[1:47:58] amen what he said
[1:48:00] he said it would lose all common decency
[1:48:04] think of our country what a what a
[1:48:06] trumpet sound that you're listening why
[1:48:09] how would you be halted between the
[1:48:12] opinion of whether you're going to serve
[1:48:14] manna or serve god when you can look
[1:48:17] down the road and see that a man sat in
[1:48:20] a classroom for 45 minutes shooting kids
[1:48:33] that don't wake you up
[1:48:38] that'll make you shake yourself
[1:48:44] they're letting criminals out of prison

[1:49:23] uncertainty out of your life what's it
[1:49:25] going to take when you're going to give
[1:49:27] up seeking a career and making millions

[1:49:42] the trumpet sounding
[1:49:48] men marrying men

[1:49:56] political mind about taxes and our
[1:49:59] government gives a married couple tax
[1:50:01] benefits okay fine
[1:50:07] but it ought to shake our soul

[1:57:04] brother i remember you almost met your
[1:57:06] end
[1:57:10] you don't look at the end of a clock
[1:57:15] you look at your end
[1:57:23] that's the end
[1:57:25] that you're dealing with
[1:57:28] are you right right now ready to go up
[1:57:31] right now or are you in a place of
[1:57:33] uncertainty
[1:57:38] okay
[1:57:40] in other words instead of checking up
[1:57:43] because you're certain that this is
[1:57:45] going uptime in other words you've heard
[1:57:48] the voice
[1:57:50] of the signs of the time
[1:57:55] the signs of the time are a voice jesus
[1:57:57] says look at the fig tree when it puts
[1:58:00] forth its lambs he says look at this
[1:58:02] look at the signs of the time we know by
[1:58:05] the signs of the time
[1:58:08] that i need to check up not for the
[1:58:11] world
[1:58:13] i need to check up for my time
[1:58:16] is my time right it's my life for the
[1:58:20] for the
[1:58:21] faithful time that god's given me
[1:58:25] when my day and my hour has come
[1:58:29] have i met the challenge of the hour
[1:58:32] that
[1:58:33] i live in
[1:58:38] it's got to get certain
[1:58:42] the evening light sounds
[1:58:45] coming on
[1:58:47] what is the evening light sound
[1:58:51] according to malachi 4 it's the message
[1:58:55] to restore the faith
[1:58:58] of people
[1:58:59] the faith of the fathers to the children
[1:59:03] a message
[1:59:06] now

[1:59:19] i mean when i say that you you know
[1:59:23] and not that brother brown was a prophet
[1:59:28] not that this is what we believe
[1:59:31] and we love to say things that make us
[1:59:33] feel good or you're elected your name's
[1:59:35] on the books of life nothing can take it
[1:59:37] off nothing you put it on
[1:59:39] hallelujah hallelujah then live loose
[1:59:49] our lives testify louder than our words
[1:59:55] see this morning now we're not
[1:59:57] we're not talking condemnation
[2:00:00] we're trying to
[2:00:02] talk the recognition
[2:00:04] of uncertainty
[2:00:09] we've got to recognize uncertainty
[2:00:13] because there's an uncertain sound
[2:00:17] the world is giving out a sound that's
[2:00:19] not certain
[2:00:21] they don't know where they're going
[2:00:24] they don't know what they're doing
[2:00:27] they don't know how to solve their
[2:00:29] problems
[2:00:32] is there something certain yes
[2:00:36] it's the word of god
[2:00:41] now listen he says now the church didn't
[2:00:44] know him
[2:00:46] why because they
[2:00:48] they hadn't been trained
[2:00:50] to the voice
[2:00:53] he said they had been trained to the
[2:00:55] voice of the ecclesiastical system of
[2:00:58] the day
[2:00:59] and it was an uncertain voice they
[2:01:02] didn't know what to do when jesus walked
[2:01:05] out there and foretold things and
[2:01:07] prophesied things and yet their own
[2:01:10] scriptures telling them
[2:01:12] telling them that when he come that's
[2:01:15] what he would do
[2:01:18] they didn't know the sound
[2:01:24] no i i hope i can
[2:01:27] i wish i was a better speaker
[2:01:31] that i could use vocabulary and words to
[2:01:34] let this sink in
[2:01:36] god is playing a symphony for you
[2:01:44] with modern events
[2:01:50] he's playing a concert for you
[2:01:55] with the condition of the world
[2:01:57] and the fulfillment of prophecy in the
[2:02:00] beginning of plagues
[2:02:05] he he's showing us everything to try to
[2:02:09] tell us
[2:02:11] let's get certain
[2:02:14] about this message
[2:02:16] and about god's word
[2:02:19] because we're not going to rise up to be
[2:02:22] the church that we're supposed to be
[2:02:24] unless we're 100
[2:02:27] certain and sold out
[2:02:29] on the voice of this age
[2:02:32] what is the sound of this age malachi 4
[2:02:35] 5.
[2:02:42] she said but they didn't know the sound
[2:02:44] and they didn't
[2:02:45] know what to do so here jesus shows up
[2:02:48] the very fulfillment of all their
[2:02:50] prophecies they didn't know what to do
[2:02:51] with them
[2:02:57] and he told them if you can't believe me
[2:02:59] for my words believe me for my works
[2:03:03] they're still confused
[2:03:05] which one of you can convict me of sin
[2:03:11] they couldn't lay a finger on this
[2:03:13] character
[2:03:16] they couldn't lay a finger on his works
[2:03:19] he said search the scriptures
[2:03:24] for in them you'll find that they speak
[2:03:26] of me
[2:03:31] i do nothing
[2:03:33] unless the father
[2:03:35] shows me
[2:03:39] yet they didn't they couldn't hear the
[2:03:41] voice
[2:03:42] they couldn't recognize the time
[2:03:46] they sat right there and was blinded
[2:03:51] well that ought to make us all
[2:03:54] very humble
[2:03:57] that he blinded them
[2:03:59] so he could bring it to you
[2:04:07] they were frustrated
[2:04:09] just holding something back
[2:04:12] i'd like to blast them talk about a
[2:04:14] frustration yes frustrated they didn't
[2:04:17] know what to do
[2:04:18] they said they they seen something
[2:04:21] happened and they know that they had to
[2:04:23] answer to their people and instead of
[2:04:26] taking the gospel and searching it out
[2:04:30] when he stood there
[2:04:32] and perceived their thoughts
[2:04:35] they just
[2:04:36] they was going to tell their people he
[2:04:39] was beelzebub
[2:04:41] they just cast it off
[2:04:44] oh it's the devil
[2:04:45] jesus turned around and said i forgive
[2:04:47] you for that but someday the holy ghost
[2:04:50] is going to come to do the same thing
[2:04:53] one word against it will never be
[2:04:55] forgiven
[2:04:56] the uncertainty
[2:04:58] and the certainty
[2:05:00] when a certain sounds the uncertainty
[2:05:03] uncertain is confused and when the
[2:05:06] uncertain sounds the certains confused
[2:05:09] until he sees where
[2:05:12] what's sounding
[2:05:14] yes
[2:05:16] you're an elect people
[2:05:20] there should be no uncertainty
[2:05:23] in your life
[2:05:26] a man knows where he's standing he can
[2:05:28] hear the uncertain sound but he won't
[2:05:32] listen to it that's right a stranger
[2:05:35] they will not
[2:05:37] follow
[2:05:40] all right what happened
[2:05:42] what made them that way
[2:05:45] why did they do it how did they do it
[2:05:50] they denied the word
[2:05:52] and when you deny the word there's only
[2:05:54] one thing to build upon
[2:05:56] and that's the educational system
[2:06:01] when the truth is denied
[2:06:03] education is accepted
[2:06:12] think of it
[2:06:14] when the truth is denied
[2:06:17] education
[2:06:19] is accepted
[2:06:27] now i want you to notice when a man's
[2:06:29] heart
[2:06:31] when a man hears the voice of god
[2:06:34] personally hears the word of god
[2:06:37] now you can hear it
[2:06:39] you say well god has come to to meet me
[2:06:43] yes sir i could sit here and preach
[2:06:47] till i fell dead in the pulpit
[2:06:50] 20 or 30 years from now
[2:06:52] you would never hear until god reveals
[2:06:56] the word to you
[2:06:57] you can sit right in your seat
[2:07:00] you don't have to be
[2:07:02] by
[2:07:03] a burning bush
[2:07:05] maybe you are closer than you think you
[2:07:07] are just sit there and let god speak to
[2:07:11] you in the word
[2:07:15] he can speak to you this morning
[2:07:18] you're closer than you think
[2:07:21] he says
[2:07:23] they don't either and they take the
[2:07:24] educational
[2:07:26] system
[2:07:28] in instead
[2:07:30] when they deny the truth education is
[2:07:33] accepted that's exactly right
[2:07:36] they took education
[2:07:38] instead of them experiencing
[2:07:40] we used to have
[2:07:43] experience we used to have with god we
[2:07:46] send our children over to school
[2:07:48] somewhere
[2:07:49] a phd in an lld and bring him home
[2:07:53] and he knows no more about god than a
[2:07:55] hot and tot knows about an egyptian
[2:07:57] night right
[2:07:58] we take our children
[2:08:01] we take our children to in sunday
[2:08:04] schools god don't have any grandchildren
[2:08:07] god has sons that's right but we take
[2:08:11] we take them in and say well they're
[2:08:13] pentecostal because their mother was
[2:08:16] pentecostal raised them pentecostal that
[2:08:18] don't make them pentecostal pentecostal
[2:08:21] is an experience
[2:08:25] sunday school don't teach your children
[2:08:27] you teach your children
[2:08:32] you talk to your brothers and your
[2:08:34] sisters
[2:08:36] about god
[2:08:38] i'm going to close with this and then
[2:08:39] i'm going to just finish
[2:08:41] i'm going to
[2:08:43] truth
[2:08:44] that's the reason we're losing
[2:08:48] now look at church
[2:08:49] we're losing
[2:08:54] is america what it used to be
[2:08:58] are our morals what they used to be
[2:09:00] is marriage sacred anymore
[2:09:05] they wouldn't they wouldn't use a
[2:09:07] three-letter word on television
[2:09:13] now vocabulary is wide open
[2:09:18] i don't know
[2:09:20] you know
[2:09:23] i wish i had more quotes
[2:09:25] on it but i thought what he said well
[2:09:27] there's doubt leave it out
[2:09:30] if you have to question it don't take a
[2:09:33] chance
[2:09:38] but uncertainty leads to chance
[2:09:44] taking i know all our kids want cell
[2:09:47] phones
[2:09:48] and i'm sure there's a lot of reasons to
[2:09:51] have cell phones and all those things
[2:09:55] but i don't know if the technology is
[2:09:57] there but i wouldn't hand a kid a cell
[2:09:58] phone that he could get on the internet
[2:10:00] and watch the stuff that's out there
[2:10:02] if you can help it
[2:10:05] i surely wouldn't give them something
[2:10:07] that's smarter than you are
[2:10:15] why don't you just hand him a checkbook
[2:10:18] or a credit card
[2:10:22] how many is willing to give your
[2:10:23] teenager credit cards here's a correct
[2:10:25] card just
[2:10:26] do whatever you feel bad
[2:10:32] you're not certain
[2:10:35] you're certain enough not to give them
[2:10:37] that
[2:10:43] well if you got to give him a cell phone
[2:10:45] set some rules up
[2:10:50] i think you can monitor the time it's on
[2:10:52] i think you can monitor the
[2:10:53] conversations i think you can monitor
[2:10:57] they want their privacy
[2:10:59] they want their freedom let them pay
[2:11:00] their own rent
[2:11:02] let them get their own insurance let
[2:11:04] them pray for their own education you
[2:11:06] know what parents we need to get some
[2:11:08] backbone and some guts
[2:11:11] because the word of god said the
[2:11:13] children would rule the parents in the
[2:11:15] last days
[2:11:22] how come all the people that didn't have
[2:11:23] kids amen
[2:11:31] no it's a challenge
[2:11:34] you know why you're uncertain
[2:11:39] uncertainty is a plague in the church
[2:11:41] right now
[2:11:43] it caused good men
[2:11:45] and good preachers who stood for this le
[2:11:48] this message for 30 and 40 years to walk
[2:11:51] away
[2:11:52] because they let a spirit
[2:11:55] of uncertainty come in
[2:11:58] they no longer were sure
[2:12:03] someone who's not sure is not committed
[2:12:13] that's the reason we're losing
[2:12:15] because we're we're taking our boys and
[2:12:18] teaching them education
[2:12:21] instead of the principles of the bible
[2:12:24] and the salvation of god
[2:12:26] and the power of the holy ghost
[2:12:29] that's the reason on this great revival
[2:12:31] we
[2:12:32] what we have done the assemblies have
[2:12:35] hatched out great big groups like oral
[2:12:38] roberts
[2:12:40] and other churches
[2:12:43] a church of god billy graham baptist and
[2:12:45] so far thousands and thousands but where
[2:12:48] is that church of christ spoke of
[2:12:51] where is that great powerful church of
[2:12:54] god he promised
[2:12:57] so that was what raised my question
[2:13:00] and
[2:13:01] and when i looked at the question
[2:13:04] and then i i saw
[2:13:06] within the same freak of the sermon is
[2:13:08] where is that church
[2:13:10] where is that church the church isn't
[2:13:12] there because the church isn't certain
[2:13:19] there's still people that aren't 100
[2:13:21] percent sold out to this message
[2:13:24] just in case
[2:13:31] or because somebody else can raise
[2:13:34] questions
[2:13:39] they raise questions about oh the cloud
[2:13:42] and the seven angels he saw in it and
[2:13:44] everything
[2:13:46] i don't know where brother branham was
[2:13:48] when he saw it
[2:13:51] you tell me where brother brown was and
[2:13:52] you come back and tell me where paul was
[2:13:56] when he got caught up into the third
[2:13:58] heaven
[2:13:59] which epistle did he write you give me
[2:14:01] that time frame you tell me where he you
[2:14:04] tell me where philip was
[2:14:10] so when they can't explain it and they
[2:14:12] can't get revelation what do they turn
[2:14:14] to
[2:14:15] education
[2:14:18] education's got to have some logical
[2:14:20] timeline you're dealing with eternity
[2:14:25] where were you
[2:14:27] when the sons and daughters of god
[2:14:30] shouted for joy before the foundation of
[2:14:33] the world
[2:14:34] where was i before i was here
[2:14:42] when brother van's wife said what
[2:14:44] happened to your hair he says you tell
[2:14:45] me where they were before i got them and
[2:14:47] i'll tell you where they are now
[2:14:50] ain't lost to one of them they're
[2:14:52] somewhere
[2:14:54] ignorance
[2:14:58] uncertainty sows ignorance
[2:15:03] so we've had a certain voice we've had a
[2:15:06] certain sound
[2:15:08] we've had a message that's given us
[2:15:11] a a certain sound we know the sound
[2:15:17] so if we know the sound we know the word
[2:15:20] now we've got to understand
[2:15:22] i'm not going to amount to anything
[2:15:25] until i have an absolute until i can
[2:15:28] wash the uncertainty out of my life
[2:15:31] though i'm sold out
[2:15:34] because this is lady osea
[2:15:37] you can't serve manna in god
[2:15:44] the church that's going to rise up
[2:15:47] is the church that's heard the voice of
[2:15:49] god in this last day
[2:15:53] they understand this is true truth this
[2:15:55] is what's going to be we just listen to
[2:15:57] a portion of that tape things that are
[2:15:59] to be that wasn't things that might be
[2:16:05] it wasn't this is a possibility of what
[2:16:09] might happen
[2:16:17] uncertainty
[2:16:21] let's talk about uncertainty just for a
[2:16:23] few moments
[2:16:26] anything that's
[2:16:28] uncertain
[2:16:30] is unreliable
[2:16:34] and can't be trusted
[2:16:41] you know there's a great
[2:16:44] subject uh
[2:16:47] see if i can just find that great word
[2:16:49] that i
[2:16:51] i i want i want to use
[2:16:54] and it's
[2:16:56] it's it's what it's what they call
[2:17:02] i think it's called
[2:17:04] quantum
[2:17:05] mechanics
[2:17:08] me and joseph gordon are well versed in
[2:17:10] quantum mechanics
[2:17:14] they have to figure
[2:17:18] in quantum mechanics that's the study of
[2:17:20] small particles
[2:17:22] like
[2:17:23] electrons and atoms
[2:17:26] now they say that if you had a baseball
[2:17:28] and you threw the baseball that
[2:17:30] mathematically if they had all the data
[2:17:32] they could tell you where that baseball
[2:17:33] would land
[2:17:36] but they said a little electron you
[2:17:38] don't know what it's going to do
[2:17:43] and if you if it did go where you
[2:17:46] thought it was going to go you wouldn't
[2:17:47] know how it got there
[2:17:50] it's uncertain
[2:17:52] they're uncertain of what they do
[2:17:56] so they they built everything around
[2:17:58] uncertainty
[2:18:00] i think yeah this is great we got
[2:18:02] nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs
[2:18:05] and there's a whole
[2:18:06] a
[2:18:07] thing there how do you say that that
[2:18:09] guy's name right there
[2:18:11] starkling h
[2:18:13] eisenberg heisenbergs
[2:18:18] uncertainty
[2:18:19] principle
[2:18:24] that's science
[2:18:29] in other words the principle of
[2:18:31] something that's unreliable that can't
[2:18:34] be trusted
[2:18:38] and others are saying we've got to make
[2:18:40] provisions
[2:18:42] because we got something we're not
[2:18:45] certain of and we can't trust
[2:18:50] that's what uncertainty does
[2:18:54] uncertainty creates risk
[2:19:02] you ever heard of risk management
[2:19:06] management is why you pay what you pay
[2:19:08] for insurance
[2:19:10] because they're not certain of what you
[2:19:12] will do they're not certain of what's
[2:19:13] going to happen so there's a whole study
[2:19:16] of you take things that are uncertain is
[2:19:19] there any uncertainty in your business
[2:19:22] i thought that's why they had you there
[2:19:26] well if anybody can get rid of it you
[2:19:28] can't
[2:19:30] uncertainty
[2:19:34] you're living in a world we heard that's
[2:19:36] totally uncertain
[2:19:38] they're so uncertain they actually got
[2:19:40] laws and principles of
[2:19:46] uncertainty they're not certain
[2:19:48] everybody's going to drive down the road
[2:19:50] they're not certain of things
[2:19:54] uncertainty causes risk
[2:19:59] what did you hear the prophet of god say
[2:20:01] don't
[2:20:02] take
[2:20:04] a chance
[2:20:07] don't take a risk
[2:20:12] uncertainty
[2:20:14] causes risk because they're uncertain
[2:20:18] they know there's a risk
[2:20:21] i believe they call it risk and reward
[2:20:27] god doesn't have a risk and reward
[2:20:29] program
[2:20:31] he's got a certain program
[2:20:34] my word certain
[2:20:36] you confess me
[2:20:38] before men and i'll confess you before
[2:20:41] my father
[2:20:44] if your life confesses me before man i
[2:20:47] will confess you before my father
[2:20:52] if you choose me i'll stand for you
[2:20:58] if i start to work in you
[2:21:00] i will finish it till the end
[2:21:03] but uncertainty causes risk
[2:21:06] risk means there's a chance of
[2:21:10] failure
[2:21:12] there's a chance of something
[2:21:14] happening different than you thought
[2:21:17] would happen
[2:21:22] uncertainty
[2:21:24] creates risk
[2:21:29] uncertainty creates compromise
[2:21:36] you're not certain of something
[2:21:40] if you're not certain you're not going
[2:21:41] to make a stand so uncertain it creates
[2:21:44] compromise you're willing to compromise
[2:21:49] christians don't compromise
[2:21:53] we're talking about this morning is
[2:21:55] let's get rid of all the uncertainty
[2:21:58] among us
[2:22:00] either we're sold out to this message
[2:22:03] we're sold out to what's on those tapes
[2:22:05] we're sold out to what he said either
[2:22:08] that's the way it is or it isn't.
[2:22:14] but if there's one
[2:22:16] ounce of uncertainty
[2:22:18] you will compromise
[2:22:23] you will make decisions that this
[2:22:25] message would keep you from making
[2:22:30] but because it's not your absolute and
[2:22:32] you're not certain
[2:22:34] you will go out on tenuous ground
[2:22:38] you will go out and make risk and
[2:22:41] compromise
[2:22:45] because you weren't a hundred percent
[2:22:47] positive
[2:22:49] that that covers everything
[2:22:57] heaven and earth will pass away
[2:23:00] but my word will not pass away
[2:23:07] uncertainty causes choices
[2:23:10] without
[2:23:12] certain outcomes
[2:23:16] risk causes you to make choices
[2:23:20] you know there's
[2:23:22] a great
[2:23:24] study here
[2:23:27] and i won't go into all this but
[2:23:33] this is a whole study on uncertainty
[2:23:36] and the effects on mental health
[2:23:41] and you know what they bring depression
[2:23:42] back to
[2:23:44] the inability to accept uncertainty
[2:23:50] anxiety uncertainty
[2:23:53] their final conclusion is the effect of
[2:23:56] uncertainty runs deep through all mental
[2:24:01] illness
[2:24:09] there's a such thing as mental illness
[2:24:13] and i know
[2:24:15] you know and
[2:24:17] i know what
[2:24:19] and i appreciate doctors and
[2:24:21] psychologists
[2:24:22] and and all the people that are trying
[2:24:24] to help people treat it
[2:24:28] but i know what they do
[2:24:32] first of all they're trying to separate
[2:24:34] you from the problem
[2:24:39] and they may give you coping skills they
[2:24:41] may have you understand it but in this
[2:24:44] whole article
[2:24:46] on treating mental health he says the
[2:24:49] most difficult thing we have to deal
[2:24:51] with is the uncertainty of our diagnosis
[2:25:00] i like doctors who practice on you
[2:25:05] we think it's this we're going to take
[2:25:06] this out
[2:25:08] and if it's not that we'll take this out
[2:25:12] and we'll give you this and we'll give
[2:25:14] you that
[2:25:17] i don't know if this will work or not
[2:25:19] let's try it
[2:25:25] you're living
[2:25:26] you're living with uncertainty
[2:25:30] it's bread
[2:25:32] into us
[2:25:34] educated into us
[2:25:37] because when they
[2:25:38] reject
[2:25:39] the word when they direct what is
[2:25:42] certain they've got to take education
[2:25:47] and we've got all this educational
[2:25:50] out there trying to educate the church
[2:25:53] and give the church of the living god an
[2:25:56] educated substitute to god's
[2:25:59] the saint the lord
[2:26:07] we're trying to incorporate all kinds of
[2:26:09] there's excuses i don't know if he said
[2:26:13] it that settles it
[2:26:15] i don't know what it'll do to the world
[2:26:17] i don't know what it's going to affect i
[2:26:19] don't care how it's going to affect the
[2:26:21] job this said the righteous shall not
[2:26:23] beg bran
[2:26:25] [Music]
[2:26:32] you think there's an uncertainty if you
[2:26:34] quit your job because you can't live the
[2:26:36] word of god
[2:26:38] no there's not
[2:26:44] uncertainties and doesn't live in the
[2:26:47] lives of christians
[2:26:51] he said if i choose him
[2:26:55] he says choose you first the kingdom of
[2:26:58] god and all else will be added unto you
[2:27:02] how certain is that
[2:27:04] that's the kind of certainty i want i
[2:27:07] don't want to deal with uncertainty
[2:27:09] because uncertainty causes you to make
[2:27:11] choices
[2:27:13] that you don't know the outcome of
[2:27:16] you don't know the effect if you start
[2:27:18] missing services for work you don't know
[2:27:20] the effect of that on your life
[2:27:23] we don't know the effect of a lot of
[2:27:24] things but what i'm trying to say if
[2:27:26] this church is going to rise up to our
[2:27:29] very own testimony that comes out of our
[2:27:32] mouth that we're followers of this
[2:27:34] message i'm a follower of william
[2:27:36] branham as he was a follower of jesus
[2:27:38] christ paul said follow after me
[2:27:44] and he teaches the same thing
[2:27:48] why do i have to tiptoe
[2:27:51] around a bunch of deaf blind miserable
[2:27:54] naked people and don't know it
[2:27:59] because i'm uncertain
[2:28:02] of how they're going to treat me
[2:28:04] well let me tell you
[2:28:05] i can end that uncertainty
[2:28:07] they hate you
[2:28:12] they will kill you thinking they're
[2:28:14] doing god a service
[2:28:19] but where's your stand
[2:28:21] where's our certainty
[2:28:28] if you want people to come here so i can
[2:28:30] present them a jesus
[2:28:33] that they like
[2:28:35] i don't have to have to point you to any
[2:28:38] other place than where jesus was in this
[2:28:41] generation he was veiled in that
[2:28:44] ministry
[2:28:49] that's where you find the word of
[2:28:52] god because the trumpet is the voice
[2:28:56] of malachi 4 5 to this generation i am
[2:29:00] certain of it i am more certain of it
[2:29:03] this morning than i was 10 minutes ago i
[2:29:06] am so certain of it because everything
[2:29:09] that he said i can actually look outside
[2:29:12] of these walls and see it happening just
[2:29:14] the way he said it would happen what
[2:29:17] does it take me to wake up and stand up
[2:29:19] and say people
[2:29:22] there was a man here who could turn on
[2:29:24] the light
[2:29:28] it shall be light in the evening time
[2:29:31] [Music]
[2:29:36] but it causes compromising
[2:29:39] it you know what uncertainty does it
[2:29:42] restricts authority
[2:29:47] you don't have no authority if you're
[2:29:48] uncertain
[2:29:51] like the sons of cephas
[2:29:55] i thought they'd go over and cast out a
[2:29:57] few devils
[2:29:59] they weren't certain
[2:30:02] they were trying
[2:30:05] oh
[2:30:07] satan
[2:30:10] i adjure you
[2:30:11] in the name of paul
[2:30:14] i assure you in the name of jesus those
[2:30:16] devils looked at them and said hey you
[2:30:18] know something paul i know
[2:30:21] and jesus i know
[2:30:26] but who are you
[2:30:29] by what authority do you come
[2:30:32] by what authority do you lay your hands
[2:30:35] on the sick but what authority you do
[2:30:38] you introduce somebody to jesus christ
[2:30:40] by what authority do you cast out devils
[2:30:43] but what authority do you speak that
[2:30:45] you're the bride of jesus christ by what
[2:30:48] authority where's your authority
[2:30:53] if you're uncertain
[2:30:55] your authority is restricted
[2:30:58] it's limited
[2:31:04] how are we going to go forward as a body
[2:31:06] of believers
[2:31:10] with any big eyes or little use in here
[2:31:16] i don't want nickel ladenism
[2:31:22] i don't want every time somebody's got
[2:31:23] to be baptized we got to call the pastor
[2:31:26] because he does the baptism
[2:31:28] i don't believe it
[2:31:31] you win them you baptize them
[2:31:36] this isn't no sacred pool of bethesda
[2:31:38] back here
[2:31:41] take them to the creek take them to the
[2:31:43] pool take them to the river you've got
[2:31:46] authority if you're certain that baptism
[2:31:49] in the name of the lord jesus christ is
[2:31:51] the only scriptural way to be baptized
[2:31:53] and if you're not baptized in the name
[2:31:55] of the lord jesus christ you've been
[2:31:57] baptized in an uncertain baptism
[2:32:03] you can't find it in the bible anywhere
[2:32:06] where anybody was ever baptized in the
[2:32:08] name of the father son and holy ghost
[2:32:12] you can't do it
[2:32:14] but that's what uncertainty does
[2:32:18] it breeds all kinds of compromise
[2:32:21] it breeds all kinds of risk taking it
[2:32:23] breeds all kinds of decision-making
[2:32:28] uncertainty
[2:32:30] is the enemy
[2:32:32] of the church
[2:32:38] uncertainty paralyzes you
[2:32:52] uncertainty
[2:32:53] restricts authority
[2:32:56] uncertainty leads to imagination
[2:33:06] it leads to all kinds of things
[2:33:09] all kinds of thoughts
[2:33:13] if you're not certain somebody said
[2:33:15] something about you that's what the
[2:33:16] problem with gossip is
[2:33:18] it just breeds uncertainty
[2:33:20] it just breeds all kinds of stuff church
[2:33:23] let me tell you something
[2:33:26] we we've got the effect the prophet god
[2:33:29] said it this way the breath bride does
[2:33:32] nothing till she has
[2:33:34] thus
[2:33:35] saith the lord
[2:33:41] where do you get thus saith the lord
[2:33:42] from
[2:33:44] the word of god
[2:33:49] i hope i don't sound like a fanatic i'm
[2:33:51] not talking about you i'm talking about
[2:33:53] your enemy
[2:33:54] i'm talking about the spirit that's in
[2:33:56] the land today i'm talking about what
[2:33:59] satan is trying to do he's trying to
[2:34:01] create uncertainty he's trying to create
[2:34:04] doesn't know whether you make a decision
[2:34:05] whether should i buy a house should not
[2:34:07] buy a house you want to know whether you
[2:34:08] should buy a house pray through
[2:34:11] [Music]
[2:34:18] i've seen people that
[2:34:20] you know
[2:34:21] i've seen people walk on a piece of
[2:34:23] property with their hands up in the lord
[2:34:25] walking all over that you know
[2:34:28] and and you know i'll be honest i was
[2:34:30] fixing to buy it and here's the guy out
[2:34:31] there praying
[2:34:33] well i said what do you say i'm claiming
[2:34:35] this land
[2:34:36] in the name of jesus christ
[2:34:39] i'm going to build my house here i
[2:34:40] thought no i'm going to build the house
[2:34:41] here
[2:34:46] didn't even own it
[2:34:50] he said i'm certain
[2:34:53] you ain't got no money i'm certain god
[2:34:56] i'm gonna build my house here well i
[2:34:58] said well i'm certain i'm gonna build a
[2:34:59] house here
[2:35:02] we were both right
[2:35:07] there's no uncertainty to us
[2:35:10] there should be nothing uncertain in our
[2:35:13] lives
[2:35:14] nothing
[2:35:15] be certain of god
[2:35:17] be certain of god you're created to pray
[2:35:21] through and hear from god hear ye him
[2:35:27] get through the uncertainty if if we are
[2:35:30] in doubt leave it out clear it all out
[2:35:32] get it all out because uncertainty
[2:35:35] uncertainty leads to imagination
[2:35:40] leads to repetitiveness
[2:35:46] do you know that how many can somebody
[2:35:48] give me the definition of insanity
[2:35:52] to do the same thing over and over again
[2:35:55] and expect a different result
[2:35:58] uncertainty leads to
[2:36:01] you know why people sometimes pray and
[2:36:03] pray and pray for the same thing over
[2:36:05] and over and over and over again
[2:36:08] they run to the altar every time there's
[2:36:10] an altar call run to the altar they go
[2:36:13] why because they're not certain
[2:36:15] of what they got the first time they
[2:36:17] were there
[2:36:22] i don't care how many comes to the altar
[2:36:25] but please stay there sometime
[2:36:29] till you're certain
[2:36:36] and if you're certain
[2:36:38] now
[2:36:40] you can go through my life you can find
[2:36:42] out all the mistakes i've made all the
[2:36:44] sins i've made he says without sins a
[2:36:46] liar i've had tons of failures i've had
[2:36:49] done tons of things i knew better not to
[2:36:51] do that sin i've done there's things
[2:36:53] he's told me to do i didn't do that sin
[2:36:56] but there's one thing you'll never take
[2:36:58] away from me
[2:37:01] is i know he saved me
[2:37:04] i know he called me
[2:37:06] and i know i reap a lot of what i saw
[2:37:08] but i know that there's nothing that can
[2:37:11] pluck me out of the palm of his hand
[2:37:13] that has been settled
[2:37:15] i'm certain of it
[2:37:19] i'm certain of it
[2:37:20] we pray for things over and over and
[2:37:23] over and over again
[2:37:27] and the repetitive cause because we're
[2:37:28] not certain
[2:37:33] i never heard of abraham continually to
[2:37:35] pray in the bible to have a child
[2:37:41] he accepted it
[2:37:45] uncertainty leads to
[2:37:49] uncertainty makes liars
[2:37:58] people just lie away
[2:38:01] they don't know what they're talking
[2:38:02] about
[2:38:03] prophet god said they don't know what
[2:38:04] they're talking about so they lie
[2:38:11] if you tell the truth you never have to
[2:38:13] remember what you said
[2:38:21] so these are fruits
[2:38:22] of uncertainty
[2:38:25] well you look at the world
[2:38:29] we're in the world church but we're not
[2:38:32] of the world
[2:38:34] we're the only
[2:38:36] certain
[2:38:37] thing
[2:38:38] that's here
[2:38:42] you are the oddballs
[2:38:45] you're the ones that's holding the world
[2:38:47] together
[2:38:48] you're the only thing certain in this
[2:38:51] world is the word that god spoke for
[2:38:54] this generation
[2:38:58] you're the ones that have the truth
[2:39:02] you're the ones that have the revelation
[2:39:03] you're the ones that have the
[2:39:05] understanding because that's why you've
[2:39:07] got to understand this whole spirit of
[2:39:10] uncertainty that's coming into every one
[2:39:12] of our decisions every one of our plays
[2:39:15] this whole battle that we have with this
[2:39:17] indecision
[2:39:19] it's everywhere i got people coming to
[2:39:21] me all the time
[2:39:26] he's trying to eat away
[2:39:30] at the very thing that we're based on
[2:39:34] i don't care what happens to the world
[2:39:38] god said so that settles it the word of
[2:39:41] god remains the same
[2:39:47] it's truth
[2:39:48] i am the way the truth the life no man
[2:39:51] cometh unto the father but by me
[2:40:03] it creates liars
[2:40:06] they'll say anything
[2:40:11] none of them have a sign none of them
[2:40:13] have a wonder
[2:40:14] so what do they rely on
[2:40:18] get this they rely on education
[2:40:22] they rely on contacting your mind
[2:40:26] instead of contacting your seed
[2:40:33] and there was only one voice that could
[2:40:36] contact the seed of god in this
[2:40:38] generation and that was the voice of
[2:40:40] william miriam brown
[2:40:45] you're actually saying the name of a man
[2:40:47] over the pulpit i'm talking word
[2:40:51] it was word made flesh it was malachi 4
[2:40:55] 5 made flesh it was luke 17 30 made
[2:40:58] flesh it was revelations 10 7 made flesh
[2:41:02] as long as the
[2:41:04] word stays up there in some sort of
[2:41:07] floating place
[2:41:09] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:41:11] word was made flesh
[2:41:14] you are the thoughts of god made flesh
[2:41:19] are you certain of that now remember
[2:41:22] what we just read to you
[2:41:24] last week and we went through a great
[2:41:26] effort of
[2:41:28] playing it for you i know i just had it
[2:41:30] right here and that was things that are
[2:41:33] to be
[2:41:35] things that are to be what did you hear
[2:41:37] in things that are to be your
[2:41:40] life was pre-planned
[2:41:51] wow
[2:41:52] i wish my daddy would have told me that
[2:41:55] when i was one years old
[2:41:57] david your name is written on the land
[2:41:59] book of life
[2:42:01] your whole life is pre-planned by god
[2:42:04] you come from god
[2:42:06] you go to god
[2:42:09] you may have to suffer things but he
[2:42:12] knows his thoughts towards you
[2:42:16] he'll lead you through it all
[2:42:19] he will not lose you
[2:42:21] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[2:42:23] his hand
[2:42:24] the work that he started in you he'll
[2:42:26] finish till the end
[2:42:31] our whole life is free planned
[2:42:34] we were predestinated to be here
[2:42:40] and can i hope you can understand i'm
[2:42:41] saying you see this uncertainty that
[2:42:44] satan's trying to get to work in all our
[2:42:46] minds uncertainty about tomorrow
[2:42:48] uncertain about the economy and certain
[2:42:50] about our jobs uncertainty about a
[2:42:52] health uncertainty about our education
[2:42:54] uncertainty about this uncertainty about
[2:42:56] that uncertainty about that
[2:42:58] and uncertainty produces borderline
[2:43:01] believers
[2:43:06] it's what it does
[2:43:09] it produces borderline believers
[2:43:11] because they're
[2:43:13] they're uncertain
[2:43:18] and i i honestly feel with all my heart
[2:43:21] when you look out
[2:43:23] all mental illness
[2:43:26] all
[2:43:28] economy the whole economy
[2:43:34] look his uh the whole economics
[2:43:38] is all based on
[2:43:40] what they're not sure of
[2:43:44] when i read that i i sat back in my
[2:43:46] chair i thought oh great
[2:43:52] you can't trust nothing but him
[2:43:59] and he's given you
[2:44:03] a sound
[2:44:06] not an uncertain sound
[2:44:09] he's given you a sure
[2:44:12] sound
[2:44:13] he turned his back to the audience
[2:44:16] and he discerned the thoughts and
[2:44:18] intents brother brennan would turn his
[2:44:20] back to the audience
[2:44:22] he would look like this and say i see a
[2:44:24] woman
[2:44:26] right here
[2:44:27] going to a doctor
[2:44:30] she's sitting at such and such codon and
[2:44:32] such and such and her name's mrs bailey
[2:44:38] he says never has the church ever seen
[2:44:42] this
[2:44:43] in all the history of the church
[2:44:46] till this day
[2:44:53] they don't know what to do with it
[2:44:58] also they say oh he was taken off the
[2:45:00] scene
[2:45:02] or this or that or this
[2:45:06] or that
[2:45:09] anything that create uncertainty
[2:45:12] remember uncertainty
[2:45:16] is our enemy
[2:45:23] you've got to understand
[2:45:27] that there's no reason
[2:45:29] for any uncertainty
[2:45:32] in our lives
[2:45:34] as believers
[2:45:40] there is a truth
[2:45:44] to every question you have
[2:45:47] there's an answer
[2:45:50] you may have to pray through
[2:45:53] you may have to fast a little
[2:45:55] you may have to wait
[2:45:57] but never be driven
[2:46:00] by uncertainty
[2:46:02] uncertainty causes you to make choices
[2:46:08] that you don't know the outcome of
[2:46:10] it causes risk it causes compromise it
[2:46:13] makes liars if there's so many things
[2:46:18] that come
[2:46:19] but the greatest thing
[2:46:22] that
[2:46:23] the word of god does
[2:46:25] is it eliminates
[2:46:27] uncertainty
[2:46:30] the word of god
[2:46:31] eliminates uncertainty
[2:46:35] so i i
[2:46:37] felt led in my heart this morning church
[2:46:42] because i see this whole world
[2:46:45] just the way the prophet of god said it
[2:46:48] we're in uncertain
[2:46:50] times the world doesn't know which way
[2:46:53] to go or which way to turn
[2:46:56] but how many in here knows which way to
[2:46:58] go
[2:47:00] which is the way to go
[2:47:04] up
[2:47:07] that's the way to go
[2:47:09] the way to go is up
[2:47:12] i don't want to go out
[2:47:14] i want to go up
[2:47:17] i know who to follow
[2:47:21] i know where my heart's at
[2:47:23] i know where the word of god's at
[2:47:25] and i'm not going to be shaken
[2:47:28] i'm not going to let any uncertainty
[2:47:30] they may be uncertain
[2:47:32] the world may be uncertain
[2:47:35] medicine may be uncertain economy may be
[2:47:38] uncertain the weather may be uncertain
[2:47:40] everything else may be uncertain but the
[2:47:44] church of the living god is not
[2:47:46] uncertain
[2:47:47] they are
[2:47:48] certain
[2:47:50] of god
[2:47:51] they are certain
[2:47:53] of the word of god and they are not
[2:47:56] going to be shaken
[2:47:58] by the battle and the mind
[2:48:01] and the battle in your mind is a battle
[2:48:03] to create uncertainty
[2:48:07] if you're suffering uncertainty about
[2:48:09] things
[2:48:10] remember
[2:48:13] there is something that's certain
[2:48:18] you're not as far away from that burning
[2:48:20] bush as you think you are
[2:48:25] just take a moment
[2:48:29] sit down
[2:48:32] and hear him
[2:48:36] because heaven and earth
[2:48:38] will pass away
[2:48:40] but this word
[2:48:43] will not pass away
[2:48:45] the world may do whatever it thinks it's
[2:48:48] doing
[2:48:49] but what was prophesied
[2:48:52] is what's taking place
[2:48:54] and we can rest
[2:48:56] on thus saith the lord god bless you
