[45:52] healing in the house of the Lord there
[45:54] is breakthrough amen

[46:16] pastor Pastor David for giving me this
[46:18] opportunity trusting that I will be a
[46:20] blessing to you amen by the time we read
[46:23] the scripture you should be familiar
[46:25] with my
[46:28] accent let's open our Bibles to Matthew
[46:30] chapter number 6 and verse 9 and
[46:34] turn Matthew chapter number
[46:37] 6: 9 and 10 and we are so delighted when
[46:41] we come into the house of the Lord when
[46:43] we see people come because The Gospel is
[46:46] not meant for chairs and benches it is
[46:49] meant for human beings so it is always
[46:51] an encouragement when we see people to
[46:53] speak to may God God bless you for
[46:56] coming and we don't take that lightly
[46:59] Matthew chapter number 6:9 the Bible
[47:01] says after this manner therefore pray ye
[47:04] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[47:08] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[47:11] done on Earth as it is in heaven Matthew
[47:14] chapter 7 and verse 7 am I too
[47:19] fast the Bible says ask and it shall be
[47:23] given you seek and you shall find knock
[47:28] and it shall be open unto you for
[47:30] everyone that ask receiveth and he that
[47:34] seeketh findeth and to him that knth it
[47:39] shall be opened and what Manner there is
[47:43] of you whom if his son ask bread will he
[47:46] give him a stone or if he ask a fish
[47:50] will he give him a serpent if ye then
[47:54] being evil uhhuh know how to give good
[47:58] gifts unto your children how much more
[48:00] your father which is in heaven give good
[48:04] things to them that ask him may God
[48:07] bless the reading of the word uh one
[48:10] more scripture Deuteronomy chapter
[48:12] number 30:
[48:14] 19 sorry about that Deuteronomy chapter
[48:17] number 30:
[48:19] 19 if you are this shout
[48:24] amen
[48:26] I call Heaven and Earth to record this
[48:28] day against you that I've set before you
[48:31] life and death blessing and cursing
[48:35] therefore choose life that thou both
[48:40] thou and thy seed may live may God bless
[48:42] the reading of the word shall we pray
[48:45] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[48:46] word we ask that you anoint it Lord may
[48:48] you hide me in the shadow of your cross
[48:51] take me aside and speak unto your
[48:53] children in Jesus name amen amen
[48:56] we may take our
[48:58] seats I'm going to speak on a little
[49:01] topic um or a subject that I called
[49:06] Choice a great
[49:08] thing Choice a great thing under the
[49:12] subtitle an unwritten law Among
[49:16] Us I got it from the uh the message
[49:19] choosing of a bride so we're going to be
[49:21] talking about choice just in line uh
[49:24] with what the pastor was talking about
[49:26] the law of the seed in the morning just
[49:28] a little bit of some continuation and I
[49:30] believe that I'll be a blessing to you
[49:33] amen I'll preach under 40 minutes if I
[49:36] exceed 40 minutes just raise your hand
[49:38] at the
[49:40] back so choice is a law of God it's not
[49:44] written anywhere maybe sections or
[49:47] quotes and so forth so uh choice is the
[49:52] ability of choosing that you were given
[49:55] by by God even though it's Unwritten but
[49:59] there's no code or Constitution anyway
[50:02] but it affects our lives in a daily
[50:05] basis so consciously we make choices and
[50:09] unconsciously we make choices we don't
[50:12] live in a day without making some form
[50:15] of choice are we together as you are
[50:18] sitting there the dress the suit you are
[50:21] putting on um I I assume that that's not
[50:24] the only dress that you have when you
[50:27] walked into your wardrobe this morning
[50:29] or this afternoon or evening when you
[50:31] chose that one or selected that one you
[50:33] have made a choice when you were driving
[50:36] to come to this place here in Bedford
[50:39] maybe the route that you chose or to the
[50:42] road that you used to come here there
[50:45] could have been another way that you use
[50:48] sometimes but when you came and pled on
[50:50] that one you have made a choice are we
[50:53] together so choice is something that we
[50:56] do day in day out but what I want you to
[51:00] lead you to today is the choices that we
[51:03] make have
[51:05] consequences some of the choices that we
[51:07] make put us in consequences of who we
[51:10] are
[51:11] today so the choice that you make affect
[51:14] your yesterday it affects your today and
[51:18] it affect your tomorrow so when we are
[51:21] growing up we get to a stage called
[51:24] adolescent stage it's a stage of
[51:28] self-discovery that's why you hear some
[51:30] folks saying you don't tell me what to
[51:33] do leave me and I want to make my own my
[51:36] own decision are we together give me
[51:39] some Grace to make my own decision so it
[51:42] is inherent in man to always want to
[51:44] make decision or to have freedom to make
[51:48] our decision and our God understands
[51:50] that but there's something that I want
[51:52] you to understand that you making a
[51:54] choice by by yourself is actually dis
[51:57] complimentary to your
[52:00] makeup or it's dis complimentary to your
[52:03] creation you are not designed by Your
[52:06] Capacity to choose by yourself and be
[52:10] correct are we together brother Bram
[52:13] says you can choose to come to church
[52:16] and you can choose to hear the word get
[52:19] whatever you want and be blessed and go
[52:22] home or you can choose to sit there and
[52:25] sleep while the preaching is being made
[52:28] so it's about the choice so the Bible
[52:30] says in the beginning God placed men on
[52:33] free moral urgency Hallelujah which is
[52:37] the right to make choices or the right
[52:41] to for him to choose whatever he wants
[52:43] so free moral urgency is the ability to
[52:45] make choices without being interfered
[52:48] with whether Divine or physical so you
[52:51] can take your decisions and do what you
[52:53] want are we to together but there was a
[52:56] reason as to why God gave men that right
[52:59] so everything you see here on Earth
[53:02] today has its origin Way Before Time way
[53:05] back in eternity that is why our lives
[53:09] whatever we do whatever is happening in
[53:11] our lives every day there are no
[53:13] accidents in it so in eternity God had
[53:18] two things he wanted to
[53:19] achieve brother branam says at the time
[53:23] of this discussion God wasn't even God
[53:26] we can call him Elohim the one who Exist
[53:29] by himself and he was just alone to
[53:33] himself but he says but inside of him
[53:36] was a desire Hallelujah to be God the
[53:40] meaning of God means an object of
[53:43] worship by this time there was nobody to
[53:46] worship him he was he he was no subject
[53:49] and he has no worshippers but in him was
[53:52] a desire to be God and also in him was a
[53:57] desire to be known Beyond being God
[54:00] because inside of him were other
[54:02] abilities are we together so if we only
[54:05] know him as God and not in his other
[54:08] abilities that it then it means he will
[54:10] be so distant in relationship to us can
[54:13] somebody say
[54:14] amen amen but there's a problem here so
[54:18] these abilities of God by which you
[54:21] wanted to be known cannot take place in
[54:23] eternity because eternity is perfect are
[54:27] we together so God is building a
[54:30] platform here to eat his cake but he
[54:33] also wants to have it
[54:36] back he wants to be known as God and he
[54:40] also wants to be known Beyond being God
[54:43] what are these abilities brother Bram he
[54:46] says we can call them attributes for
[54:48] Spiritual language right are we together
[54:50] he said inside of God was an attribute
[54:53] to be a Healer a deliverer a savior and
[54:58] what else a redeemer so with all these
[55:01] abilities in him if everything remains
[55:03] perfect there will never be any need of
[55:06] these attributes am I speaking to
[55:08] somebody here so we are still in
[55:10] eternity here we have not come to time
[55:13] yet so for you to understand the
[55:15] introduction of Satan into the program
[55:18] it was not
[55:19] accidental because if it was accidental
[55:22] then God is not in control of all
[55:24] factors of life
[55:25] and the one who cannot be in control of
[55:27] factors of life is not qualified to be
[55:30] my God this is why after he finished all
[55:33] the thoughts he designed a program to
[55:36] bring it to pass that's why he created
[55:39] Angels Heavenly beings and then they
[55:41] started worshiping holy holy unto the
[55:44] Lord so his desire to be God has been
[55:47] achieved because they are now
[55:50] worshippers but some of these things
[55:52] could not take place in eternity are we
[55:54] together
[55:55] because eternity is perfect that is why
[55:58] when Lucifer became contaminated by
[56:00] iniquity the Bible says there was there
[56:03] was no more SP space for him up there he
[56:07] couldn't continue his turn up in heaven
[56:09] that's why he was thrown down because
[56:12] eternity is perfect Hallelujah so what
[56:15] did God do God created a loop out of
[56:20] Eternity I know there's a lot of it
[56:22] Brothers here and I know they can
[56:25] understand me better with what I'm about
[56:26] to say now so the IT people can say now
[56:30] they can say let's create a program and
[56:33] we can say this thing and that thing now
[56:35] in this program we want to make a
[56:37] presentation and they can say okay some
[56:41] people can do a critique to this same
[56:43] program that we are creating and say
[56:45] what if this happens uh what if that
[56:48] happens so the IT people say okay we
[56:51] never thought about it so but we are not
[56:54] going to cancel the entire
[56:56] program uh and start writing all over
[56:59] again so what we do we create what we
[57:01] call a loop out of the original program
[57:05] to take care of that matter and
[57:07] introduce it back to the program God was
[57:10] the first IT
[57:12] specialist God was the first programmer
[57:15] and he's still the first software
[57:17] developer can somebody say Amen so in
[57:20] his own case he has nobody to tell him
[57:23] he knows what is
[57:25] and he knows what he wanted to do
[57:27] friends I'm telling you the story of
[57:29] your life so God created a loop that is
[57:33] called time then we started hearing the
[57:36] Bible says in the beginning God created
[57:39] the Heaven and the Earth Hallelujah God
[57:42] existed before the beginning but time
[57:45] was just a loop out of the Eternal
[57:48] program to demonstrate his thoughts and
[57:51] abilities Hallelujah so that the such
[57:54] the days of of demonstrations are over
[57:56] time will blend back into eternity
[57:59] Hallelujah so nothing is out of ker
[58:02] friends and nothing has been out of ker
[58:04] it's all God furthering his program
[58:07] Hallelujah so on Earth he brought forth
[58:10] all manner of creation and the last
[58:13] thing he brought forth a son now when he
[58:15] brought forth the son the sun was like a
[58:18] scoop out of out of him and that's what
[58:21] made him a son and braam says his manner
[58:24] of being brought up presented him as a
[58:27] an original creation so it is impossible
[58:31] for an original creation to create a
[58:34] condition that will make other
[58:35] attributes necessary because Adam came
[58:39] on Earth as God hallelujah when God
[58:42] gives birth he gives birth to God by the
[58:45] law of reproduction let every seed bring
[58:48] forth after its
[58:49] own human being gives birth to humans
[58:52] and God gives birth to God that is is
[58:54] why we need another birth Hallelujah and
[58:57] you can only be reborn because there's a
[59:00] gene of God inside of you Hallelujah and
[59:03] your new birth is the quickening of that
[59:05] seed gem that will start forming Christ
[59:07] in you come on Clap Your Hands for
[59:12] Jesus
[59:14] Hallelujah I feel good right here I have
[59:17] 25
[59:19] minutes so God brought forth this man
[59:22] and called him an original creation
[59:24] because he came out of God now the
[59:27] process of his coming this man can never
[59:30] sin he can never create a condition of
[59:34] these attributes to be manifested so God
[59:38] decided to bring forth his wife the way
[59:41] he brought forth his son Hallelujah all
[59:45] to come to pass so when he brought forth
[59:48] this man brother Bram says in order for
[59:50] this man to be successible to the four
[59:53] or to be accessible to the four he gave
[59:56] him the gift or this privilege or this
[1:00:00] right they call free moral agency the
[1:00:04] ability to make choices without being
[1:00:06] interfered with so in order for this
[1:00:09] woman to be able to bring the four
[1:00:12] because Adam accepted it but brother
[1:00:15] Bram says he never fell that's why the
[1:00:17] Bible says she was not deceived he was
[1:00:20] not deceived but it was he she if who
[1:00:23] was deceived
[1:00:25] so God created that woman and brought
[1:00:27] her in a way that she should take
[1:00:30] deception it was not by accident you can
[1:00:34] stud you can study marriage and divorce
[1:00:36] uh books maybe studying paragraph 152 on
[1:00:40] brother Bram says he brought it even
[1:00:43] with some features which he God in his
[1:00:47] Holiness cannot put in her are we
[1:00:51] together because those features are
[1:00:53] pervasion features does and that's why
[1:00:56] she doesn't look like other females in
[1:00:58] creation as a matter of fact brother
[1:01:01] Bram says Satan gave a
[1:01:03] shape that is why Godly sisters don't
[1:01:07] get too conscious of their
[1:01:09] shape Godly sisters don't spend time in
[1:01:13] the mirror looking at their body are we
[1:01:16] together I hope I'm not being offensive
[1:01:19] if I'm being offensive forgive me but
[1:01:21] this is the word of God hallelujah God
[1:01:24] sisters don't spend time checking to say
[1:01:27] you know because brother Bram says if
[1:01:30] you do that you are exhibiting features
[1:01:32] of a fallen
[1:01:34] nature Bram says her beauty her shape
[1:01:37] her sex control was not handed to her by
[1:01:40] God all those things were there for the
[1:01:43] purpose of being in a shape to bring a
[1:01:48] for that is why when the devil who knows
[1:01:51] the principles of Life came into serpent
[1:01:54] and serpent knew who to go to in the
[1:01:57] garden are we together so the coming of
[1:02:00] serpent into the Garden or in the
[1:02:02] picture incarnating Satan was not also
[1:02:05] by
[1:02:06] accident that's why brother branam says
[1:02:09] when when Satan brought to pass that
[1:02:12] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:02:15] God brother it's all God's program
[1:02:18] Hallelujah even Satan is being used to
[1:02:21] achieve God's purpose Hallelujah Satan
[1:02:25] is not powerful as you ascribe him he's
[1:02:29] just a two and one of these days
[1:02:32] hallelujah he Hallelujah one of these
[1:02:35] days you will find out that he's only
[1:02:37] being used and he will soon be be dumbed
[1:02:40] like a
[1:02:41] trash Hallelujah so H now God must put
[1:02:46] Adam in a position so that the choice
[1:02:49] ability can now take place so we see
[1:02:51] serpent is here serpent was there
[1:02:55] Eve was there so the serent could talk
[1:02:58] could relate even his blood could mix
[1:03:00] with human being and cause reproduction
[1:03:03] God did all these things for a purpose
[1:03:06] are we together so when God finished all
[1:03:09] this he went up into glory and then
[1:03:12] brother branam says he gave him that
[1:03:14] ability to choose by himself knowing by
[1:03:17] that he would fall right so when you are
[1:03:20] boasting around saying this is my right
[1:03:23] this is my right
[1:03:24] be careful you are creating a platform
[1:03:27] for failure because I tell you that
[1:03:30] choice ability is dis compliment to your
[1:03:33] makeup that's why the Bible called you a
[1:03:36] lamp Hallelujah that's the makeup of the
[1:03:39] Bride he called you a sheep a sheep has
[1:03:43] no right a sheep depends on the shepherd
[1:03:46] to lead him Hallelujah so here is God
[1:03:50] throwing a free moral aggen to you you
[1:03:52] must know that there's something such
[1:03:54] suspicious so don't ever glory in that R
[1:03:58] sir are we together if you have wisdom
[1:04:00] don't look at your parents and say don't
[1:04:02] talk to me like that when you do that
[1:04:05] you are exhibiting wrong symptoms
[1:04:08] brother Bram says you are exhibiting the
[1:04:10] character of a fallen nature that's why
[1:04:12] in the seals brother Bram says when we
[1:04:15] are redeemed we no longer want our ways
[1:04:18] we were created to be led in the message
[1:04:21] looking unto the Unseen brother Bram
[1:04:24] says he made a flat statement he says it
[1:04:27] might look rude but he says a man must
[1:04:30] not think by
[1:04:31] himself are we together because the
[1:04:34] Bible says let the mind that was in
[1:04:37] Christ Jesus be in you so if the mind of
[1:04:40] Jesus be in you let it do the thinking
[1:04:44] are we together that's why if okay so
[1:04:48] all these things were God's Divine
[1:04:51] calculation so that the four can take
[1:04:54] place or these uh attributes can be made
[1:04:58] necessary to take place so sepan and Eve
[1:05:01] Cross themselves so when if fell nothing
[1:05:05] has happened to the Earth something
[1:05:07] terrible happened to the Earth only
[1:05:09] after Adam became involved amen are we
[1:05:12] together if Adam was not involved Eve
[1:05:15] May perish alone and the Earth could
[1:05:18] have continued in Perfection but then
[1:05:21] there was a reason why God gave him ad
[1:05:24] that ability to choose so God folded his
[1:05:27] arms in heaven and turned his back and
[1:05:31] waited for his son to decide and brother
[1:05:34] Bram says God knew that by that he would
[1:05:38] fall are we together because the the
[1:05:41] choice or that choosing that he made was
[1:05:44] to demonstrate his attributes Hallelujah
[1:05:48] so free moral urgency the choice that
[1:05:51] was given in the beginning was designed
[1:05:54] designed to make you fall because
[1:05:56] ordinarily In Yourself by yourself you
[1:05:59] are not designed to choose
[1:06:02] correctly you are not designed to make a
[1:06:05] choice and be correct that is why we
[1:06:08] read Deuteronomy chapter 30 verse 19 it
[1:06:11] says I place before you life and death
[1:06:16] that's free moral urgency blessing and
[1:06:19] cursing please put that verse uh
[1:06:21] Deuteronomy 30: 19 let's read it
[1:06:25] together I call Heaven let's read it
[1:06:28] together I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:06:30] record this day against you that I've
[1:06:33] said before you life and death blessing
[1:06:36] and curing stop there so this is what we
[1:06:38] call free moral
[1:06:40] agents the ability for you to choose
[1:06:44] Hallelujah so and then he
[1:06:49] says
[1:06:51] therefore choose life
[1:06:55] who is now choosing now for you that's
[1:06:58] God are we together so he say that's uh
[1:07:02] that's why when we read it says I choose
[1:07:05] um I place before you death life and
[1:07:07] death blessing and cursing
[1:07:11] uh so in other words God is telling you
[1:07:13] to choose but in the next line that part
[1:07:16] it says choose life God whispered to
[1:07:21] tell you what to do you saw God God
[1:07:24] wants to influence your choice because
[1:07:26] if he leaves you to choose yeah you are
[1:07:28] going to choose death you are going to
[1:07:30] choose curse that's why God says choose
[1:07:33] life choose life so God wants to
[1:07:37] influence your choice Hallelujah Because
[1:07:41] by the convention of free moral agents
[1:07:43] he shouldn't have allowed you to choose
[1:07:46] if you are his own you don't have that
[1:07:48] right that you think you have that's
[1:07:50] right are we together that's why brother
[1:07:53] brandham says in in the message God of
[1:07:55] this evil age he says God is not
[1:07:57] obligated to to teach Ken's children
[1:08:01] Revelation he's not obligated to teach
[1:08:05] them his
[1:08:06] will they can have a free fall are we
[1:08:09] together but free moral urgency is not
[1:08:13] for the seeds of God because the design
[1:08:16] of it from the beginning it was to bring
[1:08:19] a fall so tonight you are going to live
[1:08:23] here with no no longer my will with no
[1:08:25] longer my way we are going to say I
[1:08:28] surrender all are we together so when
[1:08:31] Adam made that choice don't forget it
[1:08:34] was only after he made that choice
[1:08:38] that's when God came down God wasn't
[1:08:40] sleeping he wasn't lost in the program
[1:08:43] when everything was happening are we
[1:08:45] together but he designed it in a way to
[1:08:48] make those attributes necessary so that
[1:08:52] those attributes can be made necessary
[1:08:56] Hallelujah that's why in heaven God when
[1:09:00] he created angels they'll just be saying
[1:09:03] you know when we go to heaven some the
[1:09:05] Angels may not be able to join us in
[1:09:07] certain songs because the angel are just
[1:09:10] singing Holy Holy unto the Lord holy
[1:09:13] holy 24/7 but to us when we go to heaven
[1:09:17] we say Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound
[1:09:21] Hallelujah because God wants a worship
[1:09:24] with a sense of
[1:09:26] appreciation are we together because the
[1:09:29] angels are just saying holy holy holy
[1:09:31] but when I go to heaven I say I was once
[1:09:33] lost but now I am found that's a worship
[1:09:37] with a sense of appreciation hallelujah
[1:09:41] amen so we need police today because of
[1:09:45] the choice of Adam we need hospitals
[1:09:47] today because of the choice of Adam
[1:09:50] violence is everywhere at more you just
[1:09:54] hear someone shot somebody it's because
[1:09:57] of the choice of Adam but let's not
[1:09:59] dwell so much on Adam because Adam is
[1:10:02] gone this is your day brother Bram says
[1:10:05] in the message by faith Moses he says
[1:10:09] today you are what you are because of
[1:10:12] the choices that you are making can you
[1:10:15] find that that's
[1:10:17] 58072 M paragraph
[1:10:22] E31 brother Ram says it may be this
[1:10:26] morning of course this evening that
[1:10:28] there will be men and women sitting here
[1:10:31] that will make your final Choice andam
[1:10:34] says you are what you are today because
[1:10:36] several years ago you chose to be who
[1:10:40] you are now brother for a minute look at
[1:10:43] yourself to say who am I what am I
[1:10:47] whatever your conclusion is it's a
[1:10:49] product of now it's something that you
[1:10:53] CHS several years ago are we
[1:10:57] together if you want to be a medical
[1:10:59] doctor in my country you go to Primary
[1:11:02] School from grade one to grade seven
[1:11:05] that's seven years right and then from
[1:11:08] there you go
[1:11:09] to uh to a secondary school where you do
[1:11:14] probably we call it grade 8 to grade 12
[1:11:17] or we call it from one to from six
[1:11:19] that's six more years then when you are
[1:11:22] done with that you go to do med you move
[1:11:26] and start doing sciences and when you
[1:11:29] start doing that you move and you go for
[1:11:31] another seven years so the day you get a
[1:11:35] degree to become a doctor was not the
[1:11:37] choice
[1:11:38] day that decision was probably decided
[1:11:42] 20 years
[1:11:44] ago are we together this year we are
[1:11:47] moving into the new
[1:11:49] building the day of the dedication of
[1:11:52] the new building is not the day that the
[1:11:55] pastor made a choice it's a decision he
[1:11:58] probably made several months or years
[1:12:01] ago are we together
[1:12:05] so uh braam says 5 years from today you
[1:12:08] may be a missionary 5 years from today
[1:12:12] you may be a renowned Christian or 5
[1:12:14] years today you may be in
[1:12:16] hell because you made the wrong
[1:12:19] decisions he says 5 years from today you
[1:12:22] may be cleaning speedom in the barroom 5
[1:12:25] years from today you may be a prostitute
[1:12:28] on the street are we together don't say
[1:12:32] it's not possible you've seen people who
[1:12:34] have jumped under anointing saying amen
[1:12:37] some of them are now attacking the
[1:12:39] message of the
[1:12:40] hour let me make this statement stay
[1:12:43] away from those
[1:12:45] Sinners there are people who say preach
[1:12:47] brother but don't quot brother
[1:12:49] Branham they are all over the world
[1:12:52] whether black yellow or white whatever
[1:12:55] the case might be make your own choice
[1:12:59] believe what you believe and you shall
[1:13:01] prosper are we together so some people
[1:13:05] take a long or long around the
[1:13:09] message are we together because you can
[1:13:12] never be in the message and depart
[1:13:14] brother Bram says many is an attraction
[1:13:17] within the range of the message they
[1:13:20] have stayed so long the next thing they
[1:13:22] their sisters are wearing trousers pant
[1:13:24] and so forth and you wonder what their
[1:13:27] value have been all these years
[1:13:30] Hallelujah and when that happens don't
[1:13:33] think it just happens that day it's
[1:13:35] cataloges of areas areas of prayer areas
[1:13:39] of Disobedience areas of studying the
[1:13:41] word areas of playing church and areas
[1:13:46] not knowing why you are here and when
[1:13:48] those things they build up to your level
[1:13:50] where your system can no longer handle
[1:13:52] it and you crash into
[1:13:55] backness 5 years from today 5 years past
[1:14:00] 5 years tomorrow it's not late for you
[1:14:03] to make the right choices do you love
[1:14:05] him this evening even though our choices
[1:14:09] are unconscious yes yet effective
[1:14:12] affecting our lives in this case the
[1:14:15] prophet has an advice for us how many
[1:14:18] wants to hear the advice of the prophet
[1:14:20] in the message by faith Moses
[1:14:24] paragraph
[1:14:26] e32 uh that's
[1:14:28] 58
[1:14:29] 07
[1:14:31] to0 M the morning service paragraph
[1:14:35] e32 brother Bram says my advice to you
[1:14:41] is when you are making choices don't
[1:14:45] look at the Modern things around you are
[1:14:48] we together don't look at the
[1:14:51] popularity the glamour that could be he
[1:14:54] says choose rather by
[1:14:57] faith choice is a battle between sight
[1:15:01] and Faith sight is seeing through human
[1:15:05] eye but faith is seeing through God's
[1:15:08] eye choose by faith and faith is a
[1:15:12] revelation in the message God's provided
[1:15:16] place of worship brother Bram says in
[1:15:18] paragraph 46 he says it must be God's
[1:15:21] choosing yes he says it can't be ours he
[1:15:26] says we have no choice coming he has
[1:15:29] already chose it now what God chooses is
[1:15:32] right he says I can choose wrong you can
[1:15:36] choose wrong but God
[1:15:38] cannot choose right so brother sister
[1:15:42] hand over your choice to
[1:15:44] God Hallelujah in the message does God
[1:15:47] ever change his mind paragraph um 65 he
[1:15:52] says it's best to have God's
[1:15:55] will that's what he taught us he says th
[1:15:59] thy will be done thy kingdom come he
[1:16:02] says we must submit
[1:16:05] ourselves to the will of God and to his
[1:16:09] word brother bam says don't question it
[1:16:12] he says believe it he says don't try to
[1:16:16] find a way around it he says just take
[1:16:19] it the way it is so here we must submit
[1:16:23] ourselves to two
[1:16:25] things right his will and his
[1:16:30] word are we together the Bible is the
[1:16:34] word of God that's right are we together
[1:16:38] the message of the hour is the will of
[1:16:40] God let me repeat that the Bible is the
[1:16:44] word of God that's right but the message
[1:16:47] of the hour is the will of
[1:16:49] God in the time of Noah Noah was was
[1:16:53] told to build an ark that was the word
[1:16:55] of God for that hour and the will of God
[1:16:58] at that time and because he said there
[1:17:01] was going to come a
[1:17:02] flood
[1:17:04] so he built that Ark it was the word of
[1:17:08] God and the will of God in that day or
[1:17:11] in that in that day right but today if
[1:17:15] you come and say brother Caleb this is
[1:17:16] the word of God God told Noah to build
[1:17:19] an
[1:17:20] ark and you take your Ark here it's
[1:17:24] still the word of God but it is no
[1:17:26] longer the will of God so you you can
[1:17:29] come and and you can get your AR here
[1:17:31] brother your AR will be useless because
[1:17:34] it's the word of God but it is no longer
[1:17:36] the will of God are we
[1:17:40] together so there are times when the
[1:17:42] word of God may not be the will of God
[1:17:45] it Remains the word of God but it is no
[1:17:48] longer the will of God this is why in
[1:17:51] every age God sends a messenger to
[1:17:54] declare his will out of his word so that
[1:17:58] when you follow that will you
[1:18:00] automatically fulfilling from Genesis to
[1:18:04] Revelation he says don't question it
[1:18:07] believe it don't find a way around it
[1:18:10] brother Bram says if you look for a way
[1:18:12] around it Hallelujah he says you might
[1:18:16] you might look for a way around it that
[1:18:18] is permissive will Hallelujah but it is
[1:18:22] not perfect
[1:18:23] God may allow it but he will not accept
[1:18:26] it that is why the the word says the way
[1:18:31] we were born for example our natural
[1:18:34] birth God allowed us to come the way we
[1:18:37] come out but he never accepted it that
[1:18:40] is why when he came down himself he
[1:18:42] commanded you must be born again walking
[1:18:46] in permissive will is very dangerous
[1:18:49] Hallelujah and brother Bram says you can
[1:18:52] even find God blessing you in it but the
[1:18:55] end of it is you're going to
[1:18:57] lose are we together I'm going to skip a
[1:19:01] few things so we can quickly finish this
[1:19:07] amen choice is a great
[1:19:10] thing what you
[1:19:12] choose by
[1:19:15] yourself you can choose wrong so let God
[1:19:19] make a choice on your behalf are we
[1:19:22] together
[1:19:23] that is why we thank God that beyond the
[1:19:26] K of time the Saints who went were in
[1:19:29] their theop bodies in the body that you
[1:19:33] know all things in the body that you
[1:19:35] never be deceived the Saints cored in
[1:19:38] one voice and when they saw the prophet
[1:19:41] Hallelujah when the prophet went to the
[1:19:43] other side and they said where the
[1:19:46] Prophet says uh I want to see Jesus and
[1:19:49] they said we are waiting for you to
[1:19:51] introduce us to him and he says will
[1:19:54] Paul do the same said certainly will
[1:19:56] Peter do the same certainly he says I
[1:19:59] preached what Paul preached Hallelujah I
[1:20:02] preached what Peter preached so if
[1:20:04] Paul's group make it mine will make it
[1:20:07] Hallelujah because I preached what Paul
[1:20:09] preached and the Saints who they cored
[1:20:12] in one voice and then they said on this
[1:20:15] we are resting brother we are resting
[1:20:18] upon these ctes we are resting upon this
[1:20:20] word of Malachi 4
[1:20:23] hallelujah oh we thank God for his word
[1:20:26] so we must submit ourselves to his will
[1:20:29] and his word don't question it don't
[1:20:32] assume it take it the way it said
[1:20:36] Hallelujah why are why should you be
[1:20:38] scared by the will of God in your life
[1:20:41] you don't have any reason to be scared
[1:20:43] butam says we do not choose by what we
[1:20:46] see but we choose but what by what we
[1:20:50] believe because what we see is just
[1:20:53] quantity of our of what our eyes can
[1:20:56] declare if I stand here I can probably
[1:21:00] look at somebody who is one mile away
[1:21:04] from me but when he's one mile away I
[1:21:07] can just see that it's a human being but
[1:21:09] I can't really tell who that is right
[1:21:13] but God when he sees that he knows the
[1:21:15] beginning and the ending so let God
[1:21:18] choose because he knows what's ahead of
[1:21:20] you are we together
[1:21:23] so you have to surrender your choice to
[1:21:26] God God made three physical choices in
[1:21:29] your life that you had no contribution
[1:21:33] in number one he made a choice of you a
[1:21:37] choice for you and a choice about you
[1:21:40] are we together you had no contribution
[1:21:43] in those choices and if your mind runs
[1:21:47] very well you're going to see that some
[1:21:49] of the choices you love them we're going
[1:21:52] to share them in in 5 minutes are we
[1:21:54] together so let's begin with spiritual
[1:21:57] choices how many are happy to be
[1:21:59] Christians this evening did you choose
[1:22:01] to be a Christian God chose to chose on
[1:22:05] your behalf for you to be a Christian
[1:22:08] let's give God a clap
[1:22:10] offering
[1:22:12] Hallelujah even if you sing a song I
[1:22:14] would rather be an oldtime Christian
[1:22:17] than anything I know that's very good
[1:22:20] you are just realizing the choice that
[1:22:23] God chose of you but you never made that
[1:22:27] choice Hallelujah that's why you see
[1:22:30] that that choice was beyond you that's
[1:22:33] why says Jesus Christ said he never you
[1:22:39] never chose God but Jesus Christ chose
[1:22:42] you so you can begin to trust him
[1:22:46] Hallelujah are we together so he chose
[1:22:49] that for you so let's look at some of
[1:22:52] the choices he made for you of you and
[1:22:55] about you in the message choosing of a
[1:22:56] bride paragraph 2:15 he says remember
[1:23:00] what I said other the other day when we
[1:23:04] were having breakfast he says in the
[1:23:05] pollen of breeding male and female
[1:23:08] there's millions of gems going forth
[1:23:11] millions of eggs going forth but there's
[1:23:14] only one of them that lived he says
[1:23:18] there's everyone just like that he says
[1:23:20] out of a million gems
[1:23:24] everyone of them the same egg the same
[1:23:27] kind of gam one of them lives the rest
[1:23:29] of them died what am I saying in the
[1:23:33] hour of conception many of the lives
[1:23:36] died are we together but one of one of
[1:23:41] these million of of of lives it is the
[1:23:45] only one there's only one that did match
[1:23:49] the other life for it to become you
[1:23:53] are we
[1:23:54] together so without competition without
[1:23:58] fighting out of a million of
[1:24:02] gems just
[1:24:04] one became you are we together there
[1:24:08] must be a supernatural intelligence that
[1:24:11] took
[1:24:12] place out of
[1:24:15] 999,000 999 were
[1:24:19] wasted only one was to become you amen
[1:24:23] are we together and they said go go go
[1:24:26] go go go they left and you became that
[1:24:31] conception andam says not even mama or
[1:24:35] Papa or anybody could decide among those
[1:24:38] lives from the
[1:24:41] conception I want to ask that question
[1:24:44] to say who made that
[1:24:47] decision talk to me who made that
[1:24:49] decision so let's give God a pass mark
[1:24:54] Hallelujah who made that choice that was
[1:24:57] God he made that choice for
[1:25:01] you or maybe we ask one brother here to
[1:25:04] say okay maybe you remember years maybe
[1:25:09] millions of years of light space brother
[1:25:12] did God ever ask you of whom of who you
[1:25:15] want to be my brother who made that
[1:25:18] choice for you that's God right so God
[1:25:23] is the one who made certain choices for
[1:25:27] us
[1:25:33] hallelujah let me just keep a lot of
[1:25:36] things
[1:25:38] here I see my time is
[1:25:41] up let's
[1:25:48] stand brother
[1:25:51] Bram made a
[1:25:53] choice in the message
[1:25:57] Paradox he
[1:25:58] says because thou has chosen the Narrow
[1:26:02] Path the harder way thou has made thou
[1:26:07] has walked in your own
[1:26:09] choosing walk in that choice and find
[1:26:12] the will of God for you am he says thou
[1:26:15] has picked the correct and precise
[1:26:18] decision he says it is my way that was
[1:26:22] God's choice for brother Branham and and
[1:26:25] brother Bram says because of this
[1:26:27] momentous
[1:26:29] decision why was it momentous because
[1:26:31] when brother Bram accepted that choice
[1:26:34] heaven was startled heaven was happy and
[1:26:37] he says a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[1:26:41] thee he says what a glorious decision
[1:26:44] thou has made one time Moses made a
[1:26:48] choice he was born from uh the house of
[1:26:52] he was in the house of pharaoh he's
[1:26:53] seeing all the opulence he's seeing all

[1:27:03] slave he says you mean I'm a slave he
[1:27:06] says yes you are just in this
[1:27:08] Palace and Moses noticed that you know
[1:27:11] what I one day I have to make a choice
[1:27:14] he chose the reproach and left all the
[1:27:17] riches of Egypt and chose to suffer and
[1:27:21] be a delivery
[1:27:22] and he chose to be in a situation which
[1:27:25] was not convenient but 800 years later
[1:27:29] that choice paid off we saw him at Mount
[1:27:32] Transfiguration Walking With Jesus
[1:27:35] Christ may God bless

[1:28:28] scripture for I 1 Corinthian uh 11 verse
[1:28:34] uh the 23rd verse he says for I have
[1:28:37] received of the Lord that which I have
[1:28:39] also delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:28:42] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:28:44] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:28:47] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:28:51] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:28:54] you this this do in remembrance of me
[1:28:58] and after the same manner also he took
[1:29:01] the cup when he had St saying this cup

[1:29:14] eat this bread and drink this
[1:29:17] cup ye do show the Lord's death till I
[1:29:21] come wherefore whatsoever shall eat this
[1:29:24] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:29:26] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
