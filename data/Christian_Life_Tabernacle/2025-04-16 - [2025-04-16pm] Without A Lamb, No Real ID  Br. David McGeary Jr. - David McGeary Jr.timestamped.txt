[24:44] I pray day star shine down on
[24:49] me. Let your love shine through me in
[24:54] the
[25:00] [Music]
[25:02] night. Lead me, Lord, I'll follow.
[25:07] But before you open up the
[25:11] [Music]
[25:12] [Laughter]
[25:18] door, let your word speak through
[25:22] me. Show me what I've never
[25:27] seen before.
[25:35] Lord, I want to be a
[25:38] witness. You can take what's wrong and
[25:43] make it
[25:49] right. I pray, take the shine down on
[25:54] me.
[25:56] Let your love shine through me in the
[26:00] [Laughter]
[26:06] night. Lord, I see a world that's
[26:11] dying, wounded by the master of deceit.
[26:19] [Music]
[26:22] It is groping in the
[26:27] darkness, haunted by the years of past
[26:33] defeat.
[26:39] But then I see you standing dimming,
[26:43] Lord, shining with compassion in your
[26:53] eyes. I pray Jesus, shine down on
[26:59] me and let your love shine through me in
[27:04] the night.
[27:08] Let's sing it
[27:10] together.
[27:12] Oh, lead me Lord, I'll
[27:16] follow. Anywhere you open up the
[27:22] [Music]
[27:27] door, Jesus, let your word speak to me.
[27:33] Show me what I've never
[27:36] seen
[27:43] before. Lord, I want to be a
[27:48] witness. You can take what's wrong and
[27:52] make it right.
[27:59] I
[28:01] pray star shine down on
[28:05] me. Let your love shine through me in
[28:09] the night.
[28:14] [Music]
[28:17] Oh, lead me, Lord, and I'll
[28:21] follow. Anywhere you open up the
[28:26] [Music]
[28:33] door. Let your word speak to
[28:37] me. Show me what I've never
[28:42] seen before.
[28:49] Oh Lord, I want to be your
[28:53] witness. Lord, you can take what's wrong
[28:57] and make it
[29:04] right. I
[29:06] pray star shine down on me.
[29:11] Let your love shine through me in the
[29:21] night. Oh day star shine down on me.
[29:28] Let your light shine through me in the
[29:39] night. Lead me
[29:43] Lord, I will
[29:48] follow. Lead me
[29:51] Lord, I will go.
[29:58] You have chosen
[30:01] me and I will
[30:05] answer. Lead me
[30:09] Lord.
[30:10] I will go. Let's sing it
[30:14] together. Lead me
[30:17] Lord and I will follow.
[30:24] [Music]
[30:25] me and
[30:27] I will
[30:29] go. You have called me. You have called
[30:35] me and I will
[30:39] answer. Lead me
[30:43] Lord.
[30:44] I will go. You have called me. You have
[30:50] called me.
[30:53] And I will
[30:57] answer. Lead me
[31:00] Lord.
[31:02] I will
[31:04] [Music]
[31:12] go. Amen. Praise the Lord. We want to be
[31:16] led by him in all things that we do.
[31:19] Amen. Just a quick reminder, uh there
[31:21] will be a a quick choir practice for
[31:24] those that are going to camp. And so if
[31:26] you're going to camp and you're here,
[31:28] just remain behind after service uh for
[31:31] a quick meeting. Also, uh just a
[31:34] reminder that if you're going to camp
[31:36] with a van, uh you will need to be here
[31:40] uh tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. Um I believe
[31:43] there was an announcement uh send in the
[31:45] youth chat. So, uh, please, uh, try your
[31:48] best to be on time so everybody can live
[31:50] on time. And, um, we certainly, uh, just
[31:55] want to have those going to camp in on
[31:57] our hearts. Amen. You know, I I I
[31:59] believe with all my heart it's just not
[32:01] going because there's another camp
[32:03] service. But I believe the Lord will
[32:05] speak to us. Amen. And I believe those
[32:07] that are going that the Lord will speak
[32:08] to you and and we want the Lord to move
[32:11] in a mighty way and that your heart may
[32:13] be touched and something will happen in
[32:15] your life that you would have an
[32:17] experience that you will never forget
[32:19] about. Amen. That's our heart's desire.
[32:22] Amen. Uh brother Jose
[32:25] writes he's certainly thankful to the
[32:28] Lord for healing his eyes. Amen. He's
[32:30] going to go back to Mexico on Friday for
[32:33] a followup. We certainly would like to
[32:35] be remembered for a man but brother
[32:37] Thiago had a testimony. Let me just read
[32:40] it. Um it says testimony of healing and
[32:43] said of to the honor and the glory of
[32:45] our Lord Jesus Christ. It said 8 years
[32:48] ago I developed a chronic pain on my
[32:50] shoulder. It was a constant sharp pain
[32:53] and uh and it limited my mobility and
[32:56] affected my daily life. And during
[32:59] church service when brother Raphael was
[33:01] sharing his testimony of healing, he
[33:04] said, "If you believe you could receive
[33:05] healing, he said in a moment of faith, I
[33:08] prayed and said, Lord Jesus, if you heal
[33:11] me, I will share my testimony for the
[33:13] your honor and your glory." After
[33:16] service, I went home and in the days
[33:18] following, I started noticing a change.
[33:21] Uh the sharp pain uh began to fade away.
[33:25] My shoulder began to move freely. And
[33:27] today for the glory of God, I can say
[33:30] I'm I'm I am healed and I can move my
[33:33] arm without pain that was once limited.
[33:36] Amen. It said, "I share
[33:38] this
[33:42] Amen." It writes, it said, "I share this
[33:44] testimony to exalt the name of the Lord
[33:47] Jesus who is faithful to fulfill his
[33:50] promise and who is still heals today."
[33:53] Amen. He's the same yesterday, today,
[33:55] and forever. Amen. If you believe his
[33:58] word, you'll receive the same testimony.
[34:00] Amen. I love that. If you have a need
[34:03] upon your heart tonight, we just heard a
[34:05] testimony. We know it's the same God
[34:07] here tonight. He hasn't changed. He His
[34:10] power has not gotten less. His power is
[34:12] the same since it was sens from the
[34:14] beginning. So with all our heart, if you
[34:16] have a need upon your heart, just lift
[34:18] it up to him. Say, "Lord, I have a need.
[34:21] I want you to come by my way and speak
[34:23] to me." Amen. the brothers that are
[34:25] taking the offerings, if you could come.
[34:27] Amen. Brother Beno, if you could just
[34:29] come and take these needs before the
[34:30] Lord.
[34:31] Amen. God bless
[34:35] you. Gracious heavenly father.
[34:40] Lord, Lord, it's with great excitement,
[34:43] Lord, to hear a testimony such as that.
[34:47] Father, you're still the same.
[34:50] Lord, you haven't changed. Your prophet
[34:54] would say, "If you healed yesterday and
[34:56] you promised to heal tomorrow, you'd
[34:59] still heal us today." Lord
[35:02] Jesus, Father, what it means to take you
[35:05] at your
[35:07] word. Often times we come to church and
[35:10] we just look at a man behind the pulpit
[35:12] and wonder why that
[35:15] man, why does he look this way? Why
[35:17] this? Why that? But if we could just
[35:20] step out of the way and say, "This is
[35:23] God speaking to me at this moment."
[35:25] Through that
[35:27] lips, we could be one that take you at
[35:30] your word when the minister says, "If
[35:31] you desire healing, it's yours." And the
[35:34] same miracle that took place in our
[35:36] brother Thiago may happen in our lives,
[35:38] Lord Jesus. The simplicity of taking you
[35:42] at your word, your prophet would say,
[35:43] "It's by the preaching of the word that
[35:45] deliverance comes and healing comes."
[35:48] Lord, we never want to forget what the
[35:50] main thing is when coming together in
[35:52] this house. It's to hear directly from
[35:54] your throne, Father. Lord, there's many
[35:57] requests that have been put forth, Lord,
[35:59] unspoken, Lord Jesus. You know them all.
[36:02] I pray for the same God that moved for
[36:04] brother Thiago in this service. May a
[36:07] word be said only the way that you can
[36:09] say it that pierces the heart of every
[36:11] individual exactly where they're at with
[36:14] their need, Lord Jesus. and let an
[36:16] answer be given to them. Not tomorrow,
[36:19] this day, Father. For you're the kind of
[36:22] God that moves today, Lord Jesus. We
[36:25] know what you've done yesterday, Lord.
[36:27] We know what you've promised to do. But
[36:28] I believe in a God that works today,
[36:30] Lord Jesus. You've shown time and time
[36:33] again that you don't change, Lord. And
[36:35] whether we feel it happen today or not,
[36:38] it doesn't disregard the fact that
[36:40] you've already done it, Lord. What we
[36:42] await for on this side is the
[36:43] manifestation of it. But when the word
[36:45] goes forth and a bride accepts that
[36:47] word, it's as good as done. Lord Jesus,
[36:50] we love you, Lord. We want to pray for
[36:52] the remainder of the service. Lord, be
[36:54] with the man. Lord, anoint his lips,
[36:56] Lord Jesus. When he comes up here to
[36:59] speak something, Lord, that you've dealt
[37:01] with him on, that he studied, Lord, and
[37:03] thought on,
[37:05] Father. If you've got to change the
[37:07] subject when he comes to this pulpit, so
[37:09] be it, Father. I've come to hear from
[37:12] God. God, I haven't come to hear from a
[37:14] man. Lord Jesus, speak to me, Lord.
[37:17] Speak to your people,
[37:19] Father. We ask a blessing over the
[37:21] tithes and the offerings, Lord Jesus.
[37:24] Bless the hands that are able to give,
[37:25] Lord, and the hearts that have a desire
[37:28] to give, Lord. I know how it is. You may
[37:31] be struggling and fighting bill by bill,
[37:34] just trying to make it, Lord. But if we
[37:37] could give you the last of what we've
[37:38] got, like the woman that gave Elisha all
[37:41] she had, Lord, you blessed her and you
[37:44] said, "May the crucif run dry." Lord,
[37:47] that's the kind of God we serve. Lord,
[37:49] help us to cheerfully give. If it's
[37:51] little, let it be little. Father, you're
[37:53] the one that multiplies. My father owns
[37:56] a cattle on a thousand hills. Lord
[37:58] Jesus, all these wonderful things, we
[38:00] know that you possess them, Lord Jesus.
[38:03] Bless the people, Lord.
[38:06] be with our pastor, Lord Jesus. Be
[38:09] brother Matthew as he travels to
[38:11] Louisiana to prepare himself to take
[38:13] some services. Father, be with the young
[38:15] people during the meetings, Lord Jesus.
[38:18] Open their hearts to receive something
[38:20] that they may come back with something,
[38:22] Lord. It's not something that stays
[38:23] there, Father, but it's an indwelling
[38:26] spirit that walks with every man
[38:28] wherever you're at, Lord Jesus. It's
[38:30] easy to find God when you're up on the
[38:32] mountain tops. But what happens in the
[38:34] valleys when things get hard, Lord
[38:37] Jesus? That's where you ought to find
[38:39] God. Cuz your word stays the same. It
[38:41] doesn't change. Lord, you said you'd be
[38:43] with us and even in us till the end.
[38:45] Father, have your way in the young
[38:48] people and all that come. Lord Jesus,
[38:50] let it be a special time, Father. And
[38:53] let every person come back changed, Lord
[38:56] Jesus. not temporary, but let him have
[38:59] met you, Lord Jesus, and continue to
[39:02] meet you in that prayer closet, Lord.
[39:04] That's where the change remains. We love
[39:07] you, Lord. We'll leave the remainder of
[39:09] the service into your hands, asking
[39:12] these things in the wonderful, precious,
[39:14] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:19] Amen. Oh Lord, I come to you.
[39:25] Let my heart be
[39:29] changed, renewed, oh, and flowing from
[39:34] the
[39:36] grace that I
[39:40] found
[39:41] in
[39:49] you. Oh, and Lord, I've come to
[39:55] know the weaknesses I
[39:59] see. Oh, in me. Oh, and it will be
[40:05] stripped
[40:05] [Music]
[40:10] away by the power you love.
[40:18] [Music]
[40:23] Hold me
[40:26] close. Let your love
[40:32] surround
[40:35] me. Oh,

[41:04] eagle and I will sore with you. Oh, and
[41:09] your spirit leads me

[41:23] Oh Lord, unveil my
[41:28] eyes. Let me see you f oh to
[41:35] face the knowledge of your
[41:40] love as you live.
[41:46] [Music]
[41:53] Halleluah. Oh Lord with my heart. Oh an
[42:00] angel will
[42:03] unfold in my life.
[42:07] Oh, and living every
[42:11] [Music]
[42:14] day in the power of your love.
[42:22] Oh, be
[42:25] [Music]
[42:27] cold. Be
[42:30] cold. Let your love
[42:33] [Music]
[42:35] surround
[42:39] me. Oh, and
[42:42] bring
[42:45] me. Oh, draw me to your side.
[42:55] Oh, and
[42:57] [Music]
[43:01] I I'll rise up like an
[43:07] [Music]
[43:08] eagle and I will sow.
[43:13] Oh, and your spirit leads me
[43:16] on in the power of your
[43:22] love.
[43:25] Hallelujah. It's already
[43:32] done. Oh, and it's already done.
[43:37] [Music]
[43:40] Oh, when battle is
[43:44] over. Oh, and victory is
[43:49] won. It's already
[43:52] done. Oh, it's already done. Oh, it's
[43:58] all Let's all stand and sing it as we
[44:00] find Brother David
[44:03] Jr. Oh, and it's already done.
[44:11] Oh, where the battle is
[44:15] over. Oh, and victory is
[44:19] one. Oh, it's already
[44:23] done. Oh, I'm already
[44:27] here. I'm already here.
[44:35] Oh, and I'm already
[44:42] here. Oh, the battle is
[44:47] over. The victory is
[44:51] won. I'm already
[44:57] here. Let's just go before him. Heavenly
[45:01] Father, we're so thankful for a finished
[45:03] work, Lord. And Lord, that we can
[45:05] proclaim that it is finished, that it's
[45:08] a victory that was won and purchased at
[45:10] Calvary, Father. And we're not bringing
[45:13] any other hope, any other refuge, Lord,
[45:15] but simply to your cross we cling. And
[45:18] Father, we thank you for the ones who
[45:20] have gathered here tonight, Lord, the
[45:23] faith, and Father, and the expectation.
[45:27] And Lord, it's because it's who you are.
[45:30] And it's because we're resting in your
[45:33] bosom, Father. We thank you for this,
[45:36] Lord. This wonderful atmosphere for your
[45:39] presence. And Lord, each one that's
[45:41] played a part in creating that, Father.
[45:43] We ask that you'd be their portion. We
[45:45] just commit this service to you. We
[45:47] yield ourselves to you, Father, asking
[45:49] that, Lord, even as our brother Ben
[45:51] prayed, Father, that you'd be the one
[45:52] who ministers to the needs of your
[45:54] people by your word. Father, for we've
[45:56] been instructed by the prophet to this
[45:59] day that the things that you accomplish,
[46:00] you accomplish by your word. So, Father,
[46:03] we're giving that the preeminence now.
[46:05] And may you be glorified in the precious
[46:08] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[46:09] Christ. We pray and ask these things.
[46:12] Amen. God bless you. Uh as you're
[46:17] standing, we'll just take the
[46:18] opportunity to read uh our scriptures
[46:21] and our text.
[46:23] We're going to be reading out of 1 Peter
[46:25] chapter 5
[46:29] 8-10. And uh we're very inspired by our
[46:33] pastor
[46:35] and the the thought that he was bringing
[46:38] and just want to hopefully continue on
[46:40] and in the path forward. So first Peter
[46:44] chapter 5 starting in verse 8. Be sober,
[46:48] be vigilant, because your adversary the
[46:50] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[46:52] seeking whom he may devour, who
[46:55] resisteth steadfast in the
[46:58] faith, knowing that the same afflictions
[47:01] are accomplished in your brethren that
[47:03] are in the world, but the God of all
[47:06] grace, who hath called us unto his
[47:09] eternal glory, by Christ Jesus, after
[47:12] that ye have suffered a while, make you
[47:16] perfect, established, strengthened,
[47:19] settle you. To him be the glory and
[47:22] dominion forever and ever. Amen. And uh
[47:25] just briefly, we'll also turn over and
[47:28] read in
[47:32] um first well, pardon me, Ephesians
[47:38] 6:16. And this is normally read in its f
[47:41] full context, but we just want to be
[47:43] brief to to draw this. Above all, taking
[47:46] the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall
[47:49] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[47:52] the wicked. We just add the Lord bless
[47:55] his word. And you may be
[47:59] [Music]
[48:03] seated. There's definitely not a
[48:05] question of whether or not we're in a
[48:06] warfare in a battle. That's right. And
[48:08] and we have to be soldiers. Anytime
[48:11] you're in a sold in a battle, uh the the
[48:14] person who has the commission uh whose
[48:16] responsibility it is to fight a war to
[48:19] fight a battle is a soldier. Uh and and
[48:22] when the when the soldiers fail, the
[48:24] victims are the populace there. It's
[48:28] there's collateral damage even often in
[48:30] the targeting of soldiers. But who is uh
[48:34] willing to take the burden, willing to
[48:36] lay down their lives, willing to be
[48:37] poured out, and they understand their
[48:39] calling. uh is a soldier and we have a
[48:43] calling to be soldiers of the cross and
[48:46] we we have a responsibility and we have
[48:50] weapons of our warfare and uh that's
[48:53] what is kind of the thought and what we
[48:56] want to fellowship on and and uh you
[48:59] know it's a little bit though like it's
[49:02] not even us who's doing the fighting
[49:04] right so we we it but if we're not on
[49:07] the right footing we're not going to be
[49:10] effective. And so, we're going to
[49:11] fellowship around that that thought. Um,
[49:14] I want to thank brother Tommy for going
[49:16] and getting the U-Haul trailer. And uh
[49:20] he
[49:21] uh endeavored to do that and we were
[49:24] talking with him. He said, "Bro, Brother
[49:25] Tommy, when you show up to get the
[49:26] trailer, they're going to want an ID.
[49:29] They're going to want to know who you
[49:30] are and and they're going to need the
[49:31] ID. That's that." But he showed up and
[49:33] he had a picture on his phone of his ID,
[49:35] but he didn't have his actual driver's
[49:37] license. and they made him leave and go
[49:39] back and go get the real thing, the real
[49:43] ID. And um that kind of helps just
[49:46] formulate a thought. Um just what I want
[49:49] to fellowship on is without a lamb, no
[49:52] real ID.
[49:55] And uh we we we want all of our identity
[49:58] to be in one place. And if you don't
[50:00] have that identity, it's not going to be
[50:03] an effective ID. So, one of the things
[50:06] that is taking place on May 7th, this is
[50:09] your this is your public service
[50:11] announcement. That's right. Um, if this
[50:14] is to make you guys a little bit uneasy
[50:17] and to and maybe get people like shook
[50:20] just a tad. Uh, as of May 7th, air
[50:24] travelers at domestic airports and
[50:26] people entering some federal buildings
[50:29] must have a real ID. a a real ID
[50:34] compliant ID and uh that has been a law
[50:39] passed back in
[50:41] 2005 in a response to 911. They've
[50:44] mandated that you identif IDs have a
[50:47] higher standard or a higher threshold.
[50:50] Texas has been issuing real ID compliant
[50:53] driver's license since October 10th of
[50:56] 2016. So if you your issue date is after
[51:00] that, you're okay.
[51:02] uh you could check your ID, see if it
[51:04] has the gold star, you can board an
[51:07] airplane, but if you don't have the
[51:09] right ID, you're not going to have the
[51:11] privilege of entering certain
[51:13] facilities. Um I'm not sure if you could
[51:16] get on a military base without your ID.
[51:19] Can you just show up in uniform and just
[51:21] say,
[51:22] "Tada, I'm I'm camoed. I've got a name
[51:26] tag. I look the part, don't I?"
[51:30] um you can't get on the base. So if you
[51:33] that's I don't know if they consider you
[51:34] awall or you kind of probably get in
[51:36] trouble if you don't have your ID,
[51:38] right? Reporting for duty, no ID, bad
[51:41] move. Okay, so uh hopefully that's all
[51:45] relatable to you guys. I think Paul
[51:48] tried to relate to the people of Athens
[51:50] saying, "Hey, you've got a statue over
[51:51] here to the unknown god. Maybe some of
[51:53] you even have a student ID. I don't know
[51:56] if that even affords you any privileges.
[51:58] Maybe a 10% discount at the local fast
[52:01] food store. Do they still do that? But
[52:03] if you don't have your ID, there's
[52:05] certain privileges you're just not going
[52:07] to be able to take advantage of. Okay.
[52:10] So, uh, we just want to fellowship on
[52:12] down and I'm going to I'm going to do
[52:13] some reading, but I it's to establish
[52:16] something. Um, and and you know, please
[52:20] keep in mind the idea here is is to be
[52:22] an effective soldier, you have to have
[52:25] your ID. All right. So, we're just going
[52:28] to be taking some quotes out of the
[52:29] greatest battle ever thought. We're
[52:30] going to try to read quick just to kind
[52:32] of set a b a foundation. This is in
[52:35] paragraph 92. There's nothing can come
[52:37] up in the memory and say, "Well, I
[52:39] remember Miss Jones tried to trust God
[52:42] and so and so and Miss Do tried to trust
[52:44] God for healing one time and she
[52:46] failed." But if that channel has been
[52:49] cleared out and been purged and been
[52:51] filled on the inside with the Holy
[52:53] Spirit, that don't even come into memory
[52:56] no matter about Miss Jones and what she
[52:58] did. So, your first thought isn't
[53:00] failure. Your first thought is what the
[53:02] Holy Spirit's leading you to. If it's
[53:05] you and God together and nobody else but
[53:08] you two, there you are. There's your
[53:10] battle. Now, he's I love how he's
[53:13] pronouncing it in the affirmative. He's
[53:15] giving you your ground. It's you and
[53:17] God. You don't have to consider. You
[53:19] could take this as the creative word of
[53:21] God, declaring already declaring
[53:22] everything else as though it's not. It's
[53:24] you and God and that alone. And there's
[53:26] faith. Now, but that's the battle,
[53:30] right? Because last I checked, this
[53:33] dude's here and he's got five senses and
[53:35] he tells me I'm here. It's not just me
[53:38] and go God. I could actually see a
[53:40] couple of you in this building right now
[53:42] and you might not even be tuned in.
[53:46] But what's what is the the faith's
[53:49] declaration is the only thing that
[53:51] matters in the scenario is your you and
[53:54] God.
[53:58] 94. All right. You throw aside
[54:01] everything and open up the channel and
[54:03] say, "God, your word is eternally true
[54:06] and it's for me. If the whole church
[54:09] fails, if the whole world fails, yet I
[54:12] can't fail because I'm taking your
[54:15] word." There's the battle. That's the
[54:18] thing. Down in 122, we just accept the
[54:21] word upon the basis God said so and sets
[54:24] a string between you and God. Every
[54:26] channel comes open between you and God.
[54:29] Then there's the battle. The first front
[54:31] line, and brother David made read this
[54:34] exact quote, but let's not use a .22
[54:36] rifle. Let's get an atomic bomb. Let's
[54:39] do the job right. Let's get God's atomic
[54:42] bomb. What is it, Brother Brandham?
[54:45] Faith. F ai
[54:47] T. In his word.
[54:50] That's right. Faith in his word. and and
[54:55] faith misplaced is only as good as what
[54:57] you place it in or as temporal as what
[55:01] you place it in. But God's word will not
[55:04] pass away. Heavens and earth will pass
[55:06] away, but his word's never going to pass
[55:08] away. So if you want your faith to be
[55:10] resting in something that is eternal,
[55:12] that's solid, that's sure. The word of
[55:15] God, faith in his word, that's God's
[55:18] atomic bomb. It blows sickness and the
[55:20] devils right and left, annihilates them,
[55:22] decimates them. Oh, it's just destroys
[55:25] it. It disintegrates everything that's
[55:27] ungodly. When the bomb of faith drops in
[55:30] there with the word of God behind it, it
[55:32] blows every devil, every sickness, every
[55:34] disease.
[55:37] Amen. 126. You say the senses declare,
[55:41] "Oh, I can feel it. Yeah, there it is.
[55:44] Uhoh, I might smell it." Or so forth.
[55:47] These things are there. Yeah. Next thing
[55:50] you reason. So he's saying as soon as
[55:52] you're making a decision based off this
[55:54] channel, it's already going to go
[55:56] through the faculty of reasoning. That's
[55:58] right. Okay. It's the things that you
[56:01] can, you know, even science to observe,
[56:03] reproduce. You know, there's it's a this
[56:05] the mental faculty of reasoning. And
[56:07] he's trying to get us to understand
[56:08] there's a deeper uh reality that we can
[56:11] be in beyond the senses. And it's where
[56:15] the battle's at. The doctor says, "I
[56:16] can't get well." That ought to be. You
[56:19] see right there, you're wrong. That's
[56:22] the devil standing there. That's the
[56:24] devil poking these things into you.
[56:26] Don't you believe it. Hallelujah. God's
[56:30] word said, "Above all things, I would
[56:32] that you prosper in health." That's
[56:34] right. How can you be a real soldier out
[56:37] there? I want you to prosper and in
[56:40] health. So, it there's a denying of
[56:44] everything else in taking God at his
[56:46] word. And it's faith that has to be the
[56:48] strong hands that handle the word of
[56:51] God. Down in 155, Abraham, how are you
[56:55] going to have that baby? David Jr., how
[56:57] are you going to have that baby? God
[56:59] said so. That settles it. Well, you
[57:01] ain't got it. I don't know when I'm
[57:03] going to get it, but I'm going to get
[57:05] it. God said so. That won't stop me a
[57:09] bit. Why don't you go back to your home
[57:11] where you come from?
[57:14] I'm the pilgrim and the stranger in this
[57:17] land. God give the promise. God will
[57:20] give the baby right in the land where he
[57:22] sent me. Hallelujah. God will heal you
[57:25] right in the atmosphere of the Holy
[57:27] Ghost where he sent you. God will give
[57:29] you just believe it. Amen. Open up them
[57:33] flu of the soul and body and senses and
[57:35] conscience. In other words, clear them
[57:36] out. Open them up. They're not the
[57:38] damper. They're not what I'm leaning on.
[57:40] I'm not going by anything else. And just
[57:43] let God's word penetrate first. Take
[57:45] that mind. There is the battleground.
[57:49] Not say, "Well, if I could feel it."
[57:52] Okay. Now, take
[57:54] this. Don't Don't start resting in this.
[57:58] Well, if I could feel it, if I'd feel
[58:01] the glory of God falling, oh, that has
[58:04] nothing to do with it. Come on. Now,
[58:07] he's going to add some context to that
[58:09] later because he he talks about how that
[58:11] is a atmosphere of faith and people get
[58:13] lifted up and he and things get
[58:15] accomplished. But if that's all you're
[58:17] resting in, if that's what you've gone
[58:20] is by sensation, it's not going to be
[58:22] fruitful. What was the atmosphere given
[58:24] for? You're you're a ship without a
[58:26] sail. The wind just blew you and you
[58:28] don't even know where you're going.
[58:29] You're just woo. It's here. What are you
[58:31] doing with it?
[58:33] The word has to direct you in that
[58:35] atmosphere. You need to know what you
[58:37] want to accomplish. You need to be solid
[58:39] with the word of God. When the
[58:40] atmosphere comes to believe, you believe
[58:43] God's word the same way as if you didn't
[58:45] feel anything. But in that atmosphere, I
[58:48] believe God quickens his word. Open that
[58:51] mind. That's the battleground. There's
[58:53] where the battle sets in array right
[58:55] there in the front line of your mind.
[58:56] Open it up and say, "Every doubt, I
[59:00] doubt my doubts."
[59:02] I love that. Amen. And he he says it
[59:05] again. I'm doubting my doubts now. I'm
[59:09] believing God's word. Here I come,
[59:11] Satan. Something is going to take place.
[59:14] Sure, it will. Yes, sir. Now, we
[59:18] typically when we think of doubt, I
[59:21] don't think we purposefully say, "I'm
[59:22] doubting God." I don't think that's it's
[59:25] a lot more um if you will uh subtle than
[59:28] that. It's it's not like we are being
[59:31] willfully disobedient and we're trying
[59:32] to say, "God, I just disbelieve you."
[59:35] But there's remember it's a reasoning
[59:38] faculty. So, it's a lot more
[59:43] um slick.
[59:46] It It's It makes sense.
[59:49] There's probably some data points that
[59:52] have fed into it and uh we're going to
[59:55] be going somewhere. So, I want you to
[59:57] think about this. uh we wouldn't label
[59:59] it doubt, but we're not telling
[1:00:02] ourselves we're dis disbelieving God's
[1:00:04] word. And
[1:00:06] uh it's really just that we've listened
[1:00:09] to a voice of reasoning and we may not
[1:00:11] even be aware of it. And it I think
[1:00:14] things that we may be more familiar with
[1:00:16] is now is not the time.
[1:00:19] It's not for you.
[1:00:21] That is just your mind.
[1:00:24] That's just emotion.
[1:00:26] You're not in the right atmosphere yet.
[1:00:30] You're not at camp, right?
[1:00:36] It's it but that's a battle. Okay. But
[1:00:39] is he God?
[1:00:41] So you have to start now. What are we
[1:00:43] going to do? Doubt our doubts. So how do
[1:00:46] we do now? I'm going to now that devil
[1:00:48] Thank you. You gave me the ammo.
[1:00:51] This is going to bounce off me now. And
[1:00:54] the and the atomic bomb of faith is
[1:00:56] going to go to work here. Every doubt I
[1:00:58] doubt my doubts. Amen. I'm doubting my
[1:01:00] doubts now. I'm believing God's word. I
[1:01:03] doubt now is not the time.
[1:01:06] The scripture says now's the day of
[1:01:08] salvation.
[1:01:11] What? What? Why do I need his word says
[1:01:14] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:01:16] forever.
[1:01:18] I doubt it's not for me. It's It's for
[1:01:21] me. I would doubt that it would not be
[1:01:23] for me.
[1:01:28] Dumb devil.
[1:01:29] Why? Because he he saw and chose you
[1:01:32] before the foundation of the world.
[1:01:36] I doubt that it's just in my mind there.
[1:01:39] I believe that I'm hearing from
[1:01:40] something down in my heart that's saying
[1:01:42] amen.
[1:01:44] I It's deeper than me. It's beyond my
[1:01:45] re. I don't know why, but I'm say I say
[1:01:49] amen.
[1:01:50] I doubt it's just my mind. Matter of
[1:01:52] fact, my mind is a horrible mind. It's
[1:01:55] not. My mind ain't telling me God's word
[1:01:57] is true and anything's possible and just
[1:01:59] believe.
[1:02:00] Now's the hour. Now could be the time
[1:02:02] that God's the God of the miraculous.
[1:02:06] You know, and it and then faith in God's
[1:02:09] word overrites all the doubt. Yes, sir.
[1:02:13] So you just have to
[1:02:15] understand that there's going to be an
[1:02:18] adversary and you're a soldier. Now this
[1:02:22] is continuing on in 162. He says he
[1:02:26] anoints his servants with his spirit. He
[1:02:28] sends them angels. People makes fun of
[1:02:31] that sometimes. Angels. Let let me just
[1:02:33] turn something here with you just a
[1:02:35] minute. Let's turn over here in Hebrews.
[1:02:37] Hebrews chapter 4, the first chapter of
[1:02:40] Hebrews. And let's turn to the 14th
[1:02:42] verse. Are not all these ministering
[1:02:45] spirits sent sent forth to minister for
[1:02:48] them who be heirs of salvation? Which
[1:02:52] one of the angels did he say sit thou on
[1:02:54] my right hand? All the angels of God.
[1:02:57] Now here the Bible comes right back and
[1:02:59] tells us that God sends forth angels.
[1:03:01] Glory. What are they? Ministering
[1:03:04] spirits. Glory. Ministering spirits sit
[1:03:07] from the presence of God. What to do?
[1:03:10] minister his word. Amen. There's not a
[1:03:13] minister, some theology, some
[1:03:14] denominational group, but to minister
[1:03:16] his word. That's it. Ministering spirit
[1:03:19] sent forth. How do we know they are? The
[1:03:22] Bible said that the word of the Lord
[1:03:23] came to the prophets. Is that right?
[1:03:25] They're the angels minister the word
[1:03:28] through the spirit. Minister the word
[1:03:30] through the Holy Spirit. The spirit and
[1:03:32] the word come to the prophets and the
[1:03:34] prophets had the word of God. That's the
[1:03:36] reason they could do the miracles that
[1:03:38] they did. It wasn't the man. It was the
[1:03:41] spirit of God in the man, the spirit of
[1:03:43] Christ in the man. For the word of God,
[1:03:45] what he had done, cleaned out every
[1:03:48] channel. God had chose him. He was
[1:03:52] anointed with the Holy Ghost. And it
[1:03:54] wasn't him. He never did anything till
[1:03:56] he saw it in a vision. Elijah said on
[1:03:58] Mount Carmel, "All this I've done at
[1:04:00] your command. Now, Lord, let it be known
[1:04:03] that thou art God. Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:09] Now, this is something I've seen so many
[1:04:12] times when you see the spirit of God
[1:04:14] strike a place and that place get under
[1:04:17] the anointing. If this little group in
[1:04:19] here this morning could take this mind
[1:04:23] here, get every doubt out of the way,
[1:04:26] how can you doubt anymore when you see
[1:04:29] the dead and the dead raise up and the
[1:04:30] lame walk and the blind see and the deaf
[1:04:32] hear? And there is an atmosphere where
[1:04:35] people's faith get rise up. But if you
[1:04:39] what he's trying to train here is a
[1:04:41] soldier. What he's not just wanting us
[1:04:44] to have a good dose of Pentecostalism
[1:04:46] where we have to be coddled a hot house
[1:04:48] plant where we have to fill this mighty
[1:04:50] anointing. And I'm thankful for it
[1:04:52] because it just makes you say I'm with
[1:04:53] Papa God. I'm with him. He's here.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. And we believe for great
[1:04:57] things. And we want to speak and to have
[1:04:59] the word of God anointed in our heart
[1:05:01] and in our mind to be quickened in that
[1:05:02] atmosphere. We don't want to discount
[1:05:04] the anointing, but we're not babies.
[1:05:10] In this hour, God's raising up soldiers
[1:05:12] that could do battle for one another.
[1:05:15] And and that's ultimately what a soldier
[1:05:17] is, is they're fighting for others.
[1:05:21] And and that's that is the what's on my
[1:05:23] heart is to make sure that we
[1:05:25] understand the consequence of us not
[1:05:29] knowing how to be proper soldiers and
[1:05:31] properly equipped and knowing what to do
[1:05:33] in the atmosphere because it's almost
[1:05:34] like the water's being troubled. It's
[1:05:36] like you need you need to go get in the
[1:05:37] water. Well, when the presence of God
[1:05:39] moves, Brother Brandham in one place
[1:05:41] says don't just empty yourself out and
[1:05:43] go blank. He says come deliberately.
[1:05:46] Amen. We want to be able to have a
[1:05:48] promise that we're believing for that
[1:05:50] our faith could rise and make it
[1:05:52] personal to us in that atmosphere. I'm
[1:05:54] going to skip on down to 170. He says
[1:05:56] that don't have uh one thing to do with
[1:05:59] it. We're going right on anyhow. Well,
[1:06:02] now if you start back as a young woman
[1:06:04] again, we know though this blood of
[1:06:08] life. Well, then we find out that
[1:06:10] there's going to cushion the baby and
[1:06:13] everything will be right. Now, you feel
[1:06:15] any different today? It's been a month
[1:06:17] since he promised me. You feel any
[1:06:19] different, dear? Not a bit, Abraham.
[1:06:21] There's not a sign of nothing. I'm still
[1:06:23] just like I haven't been for the last
[1:06:25] few years. There's not a bit of
[1:06:26] difference. Glory to God. We're going to
[1:06:28] have it anyhow. Do you mean Abraham upon
[1:06:31] Look, he promised you. Surely he would
[1:06:33] give you a
[1:06:36] sign. Now, you need to rest in something
[1:06:39] besides the promise.
[1:06:41] You need to be able
[1:06:44] to not have faith and go back to
[1:06:48] reasoning
[1:06:50] because that is a place of
[1:06:53] comfort. That's very
[1:06:56] comfortable. You're not in the
[1:06:59] trenches. A weak and adulterous
[1:07:02] generation seeketh after a signs. That's
[1:07:05] right. He had a sign. What was it? God's
[1:07:08] word.
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. That was the sign. How could
[1:07:14] God heal this child? God's word said so.
[1:07:18] If I feel a sensation or no
[1:07:21] sensation, no matter what happens, God
[1:07:25] said so. That settles it.
[1:07:30] Yeah. We're we're we're maturing
[1:07:33] past needing to have that hand that
[1:07:37] physically touches you on the soldier
[1:07:39] should s shoulder and says and the
[1:07:41] soldier and and and says I'm here. We
[1:07:45] should be aware of his presence because
[1:07:46] he declared himself presence. Matter of
[1:07:48] fact, the reason we do things we ought
[1:07:50] not to do is we don't recognize that
[1:07:52] he's there. That's, you know, I'm very
[1:07:55] thankful for the testimony of our
[1:07:57] prophet when he he said he went to go
[1:07:58] drink and the or smoke and the holy sp
[1:08:01] that that rushing wind brought him just
[1:08:03] came and it was the same one that he had
[1:08:06] recognized in the bush and it it stopped
[1:08:08] him in his tracks. And I pray that
[1:08:10] that's the type of atmosphere that we
[1:08:12] could have is that when Satan would come
[1:08:13] against us, we could be that the
[1:08:15] presence of the Lord could move in and
[1:08:17] do battle on our behalf because there's
[1:08:19] ministering spirits and there's angels
[1:08:20] and I believe they're set around those
[1:08:22] that fear the Lord. And if we would be
[1:08:24] more spiritually minded, we would know.
[1:08:27] But we we often just tread right over
[1:08:29] that because we we are we've went into
[1:08:33] the realm of reason.
[1:08:36] Abraham said, 'Get your bonnets and
[1:08:38] everything together. We're taking off to
[1:08:40] the land. Where are you going? I don't
[1:08:43] know. Amen. But we're going anyhow. We
[1:08:46] go. We got to go. Packed it up and go.
[1:08:48] Hallelujah. That's the real word of God.
[1:08:51] That's
[1:08:52] what was the hold in front of him. The
[1:08:55] promise of God, the word of God.
[1:08:58] Where's We're going to have it. Come out
[1:09:02] from amongst your people, Abraham.
[1:09:04] They're the thing of it. They're
[1:09:06] doubters and
[1:09:08] unbelievers. They have you in the same
[1:09:11] fix. Come out, separate yourself, and
[1:09:14] live for
[1:09:16] me. That's important. You have to
[1:09:19] recognize if you're in an atmosphere of
[1:09:21] doubt and unbelief, you need to check
[1:09:23] your company. You need to check what
[1:09:25] you're doing. And I guarantee you,
[1:09:27] there's those that are inspired by this
[1:09:29] word of God who want to fellowship you
[1:09:31] to death. that matter of fact, you get
[1:09:33] started talking about the things of God
[1:09:35] and you just can't stop. Um there's an
[1:09:38] there's a different atmosphere that you
[1:09:40] could be in where you could be away from
[1:09:42] the doubters, you could be away from the
[1:09:44] seat of the scornful. You and and I'll
[1:09:46] say this, you need to have enough
[1:09:48] spiritual discernment to know that if
[1:09:49] you're weak and someone else is weak,
[1:09:51] that's probably not a good combination.
[1:09:54] If you if neither of you have the
[1:09:56] gumption to change the atmosphere and to
[1:09:59] bring God into it,
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] What do you expect?
[1:10:07] Bad things.
[1:10:10] Um, it it's it's because this and this
[1:10:13] is the accuser. That's what I want to
[1:10:15] the Lord willing. We can uh work our way
[1:10:17] to I'm glad I can't read the clock. Um,
[1:10:22] now the battle of your mind, we must die
[1:10:25] to our thinking. In other words,
[1:10:27] sacrifice it deliberately. Put it to
[1:10:29] death. Okay. So, we we want to be
[1:10:34] willing to take our
[1:10:38] thinking even as the the the apostle
[1:10:41] would say, hold under our body. You need
[1:10:43] to be able to willfully take your
[1:10:45] reasoning and kill it. Be willing to die
[1:10:49] to what you think to and then put God's
[1:10:53] word in its place. If you turn to
[1:10:55] Philippians chapter 2 and verse
[1:10:59] 12, this I believe
[1:11:03] captures what Paul would
[1:11:07] say. He says, "Wherefore, my beloved, as
[1:11:11] ye have always obeyed, not in my
[1:11:13] presence only, but now much more in my
[1:11:16] absence, work out your own salvation
[1:11:18] with fear and trembling. For it is God
[1:11:20] which workketh in you." And I love that
[1:11:24] it's if if you're doubting, it's God
[1:11:27] that's workketh in you both to will and
[1:11:30] to do of his good pleasure. Do all
[1:11:32] things without murmurings and
[1:11:34] disputings, that ye may be blameless and
[1:11:36] harmless, the sons of God, without
[1:11:38] rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and
[1:11:40] perverse nation, among whom ye shine as
[1:11:43] lights in the world. What a
[1:11:45] salutation. What what a what a thing to
[1:11:48] think of. Ye are lights in this world
[1:11:50] and you're set apart in it from a
[1:11:52] perverse generation.
[1:11:54] I it's it's it's uh the hour we live in
[1:11:58] holding forth the word of
[1:12:01] life. What are you
[1:12:04] doing? You're holding forth the word of
[1:12:06] life. How are you going to be able to
[1:12:07] hold that faith? You're not holding
[1:12:11] forth the word of life in doubt. You're
[1:12:13] not holding forth the word of life in
[1:12:15] secret. You're not a you're not holding
[1:12:17] it forth in any other manner
[1:12:20] but the word of life.
[1:12:24] It's on display. It's going before me.
[1:12:27] It's what it's what it I'm following
[1:12:29] after. It's it's it's the light unto my
[1:12:33] path. It's the word of life.
[1:12:36] That I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:12:38] that I have not run in vain neither
[1:12:41] labored in vain.
[1:12:43] Yay, if I be offered upon the sacrificed
[1:12:47] in service of your faith, I joy and
[1:12:49] rejoice with you. For the same cause
[1:12:52] also do ye joy and rejoice with me. I
[1:12:55] realize if you could put 17 and 18
[1:12:57] together and we could look at those. I
[1:12:59] It's kind of hard to Oh, you hold shift,
[1:13:02] you click on there. I'm just the uh it's
[1:13:06] it's takes a minute to digest this and I
[1:13:11] the offering the word used there is
[1:13:14] libation or what was a pouring out of a
[1:13:18] drink offering as they would do is they
[1:13:20] would you know sorry but I knew this one
[1:13:24] before I I was serving the Lord but this
[1:13:26] one's for the homies and you pour one
[1:13:29] out on the curb right well where did
[1:13:30] that come from you know David's mighty
[1:13:33] men came back and they and they went and
[1:13:34] got the water from the well and they
[1:13:36] brought it to David. He said, "I'm not
[1:13:38] going to drink this." And he pours it
[1:13:39] out. And this is now something that is
[1:13:43] uh apparently maybe he even seen that
[1:13:45] within the pe you know he was running
[1:13:48] with some scoundrels. David was he was
[1:13:49] an outlaw and so he may have, you know,
[1:13:52] did the best he knew how to show a
[1:13:54] reverence to the situation. But that the
[1:13:56] pouring out is what he's referencing
[1:13:59] there. He's saying his blood would be
[1:14:01] poured out. He's going to spend his
[1:14:03] life. He's willing to give it and
[1:14:05] joyfully for the sake of their faith. So
[1:14:09] that's what is the critical outcome in
[1:14:11] all of this is that they would receive
[1:14:13] the faith and he's willing to spend his
[1:14:15] life to give it to
[1:14:16] them. Okay? He's willing to give his
[1:14:20] blood and he'll rejoice in it as long as
[1:14:24] it's for the purpose of servicing their
[1:14:27] faith. If that's what it will embolden
[1:14:30] as their faith, he's willing to give his
[1:14:32] life. That's a soldier.
[1:14:36] That's got to be the mentality that we
[1:14:38] start to have is that I'm willing to be
[1:14:41] spent, Lord. I'm willing to be poured
[1:14:43] out. I'm willing to give you my all
[1:14:46] because that and brother Ben, I
[1:14:49] appreciated the prayer. That's the
[1:14:52] sacrifice. That's the
[1:14:54] mindset. It's not a giving in our
[1:14:56] plenty. It's, you know, but he wants it
[1:15:00] all. He He doesn't There's not a second
[1:15:03] place with God. There's not some
[1:15:07] balance. He wants all of
[1:15:09] you. And if you turn uh to second
[1:15:13] Timothy 4
[1:15:15] and6, he also says it again, for I'm now
[1:15:19] ready to be offered, and it's that same
[1:15:21] word, and the time of my departure is at
[1:15:24] hand. Even speaking to the manner of
[1:15:25] death. But he's he's willing to lay his
[1:15:29] life down as an offering and to be
[1:15:31] poured
[1:15:34] out. And I want us to to
[1:15:38] understand that is what makes us
[1:15:41] effectual soldiers is to understand what
[1:15:44] we're being spent for.
[1:15:47] And to his good pleasure, this uh struck
[1:15:50] me. My I had we were listening to this
[1:15:53] coming back from I believe it was up in
[1:15:55] Ohio and uh had come across this.
[1:15:57] Brother Brandham mentions Charles Finny
[1:16:00] and I went and looked him up and he he
[1:16:03] has a a nice memoir and I started
[1:16:05] listening to the audio and this is an
[1:16:07] excerpt from it and this is from uh
[1:16:11] Charles
[1:16:12] Finny and this is this is uh the
[1:16:15] background on this and maybe I should
[1:16:17] give it is Charles didn't grow up in a
[1:16:20] in a Christian home. Uh, and when he got
[1:16:23] to maybe the ability to go to university
[1:16:26] and go to school, he came around those
[1:16:28] that were what he would call religiously
[1:16:30] privileged and they had the means to go
[1:16:33] to service to listen to the the Bible
[1:16:36] being read and attend prayer meetings.
[1:16:38] And so now he finds himself drawn to
[1:16:40] this company and he's around these
[1:16:42] people who have the opportunity to, if
[1:16:45] you will, practice religion. So he's
[1:16:47] never been around people who practice
[1:16:49] religion and now he finds himself around
[1:16:51] those practicing religion. On one
[1:16:54] occasion when I was in one of the prayer
[1:16:56] meetings, I was asked if I did desire
[1:16:59] that they should pray for me. I told
[1:17:01] them no because I did not see that God
[1:17:04] answered their prayers. I said, 'I
[1:17:07] suppose I need to be prayed
[1:17:09] for I'm conscious that I'm a sinner, but
[1:17:12] I do not see that it will do any good
[1:17:15] for you to pray for me. For you're
[1:17:17] continually asking, but you do not
[1:17:19] receive.
[1:17:22] You have been praying for a revival of
[1:17:24] religion ever since I have
[1:17:27] been in Adams and yet you have it not.
[1:17:32] And the Adams must be the university.
[1:17:35] You have been praying for the Holy
[1:17:37] Spirit to descend upon yourselves and
[1:17:39] yet complain of your leanness. I
[1:17:41] recollect having used this expression at
[1:17:44] that time. You have prayed enough since
[1:17:47] I've attended these meetings to have
[1:17:49] prayed the devil out of Adams. If there
[1:17:52] is any virtue in your prayers, but here
[1:17:54] you are praying on and complaining
[1:17:58] still. So it's there's an effort that
[1:18:03] one could take in all
[1:18:05] sincerity and if it's not done correctly
[1:18:10] it doesn't avail
[1:18:12] anything and and I appreciate this
[1:18:14] because it I think it's if God before us
[1:18:16] where be all the
[1:18:17] miracles that the word has to accomplish
[1:18:20] that what it's sent forth to do and and
[1:18:24] I and God honors that but on um pray. I
[1:18:29] was quite in earnest when I said and not
[1:18:33] a little irritable, I think, in
[1:18:35] consequence of me being brought so
[1:18:37] continually face to face with religious
[1:18:39] truth, which was a new state of things
[1:18:42] for me. But on further reading of my
[1:18:45] Bible, it struck me that the reason
[1:18:47] their prayers were not answered was
[1:18:49] because they did not comply with the
[1:18:52] revealed conditions upon which God had
[1:18:54] promised to answer prayer. that they did
[1:18:58] not pray in
[1:19:00] faith in the sense of expecting God to
[1:19:03] give them the things that they were
[1:19:04] asking for. So now we're getting into
[1:19:07] some meat of something. It's not that we
[1:19:09] don't even maybe have the boldness to
[1:19:11] ask, but we're asking in doubt. We're
[1:19:14] not asking believing. And this is where
[1:19:17] I feel drawn to um and maybe we can take
[1:19:22] an angle by God's grace that that uh
[1:19:27] bruises the devil. Okay? So just stick
[1:19:29] with me here a little bit and um we'll
[1:19:32] get there in James chapter 2 verse one.
[1:19:36] My brethren, have not faith of our Lord
[1:19:39] Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with
[1:19:41] respect of persons.
[1:19:44] Okay. So don't have faith in anything
[1:19:49] else with respect to anything else other
[1:19:52] than Calvary
[1:19:54] and persons here includes you
[1:19:58] but often you know in and now our faith
[1:20:02] needs to be effectual. Now we're we're
[1:20:05] deeming who is the purchase, who's the
[1:20:08] price, what's the
[1:20:10] ID, what are we going to battle for? And
[1:20:13] if you don't see people as God's
[1:20:15] children, if you don't see them as the
[1:20:17] purchase of God, if you don't see them
[1:20:19] as God sees them as worthy to die for,
[1:20:22] then you've then you've you've judged
[1:20:24] them after another manner. And the and
[1:20:26] the word of God is admonishing us to not
[1:20:30] be a respector of persons. Going on down
[1:20:32] in the chapter uh verse 5, same chapter.
[1:20:35] Hearken my beloved brethren. Hath not
[1:20:37] God chosen the poor of this world rich
[1:20:40] in faith and heirs of the kingdom which
[1:20:42] he hath promised to them that love him?
[1:20:44] But ye have despised the poor. Do not
[1:20:48] the rich men oppress you and draw you
[1:20:50] before the judges seats? Do they not
[1:20:53] blasphe the worthy name by which ye are
[1:20:57] called? If ye fulfilled the royal law
[1:21:01] according to the scriptures, thou shalt
[1:21:04] love thy neighbor as thyself, do ye
[1:21:07] well. This is a this is a secret now.
[1:21:11] And for faith to be effectual is the
[1:21:14] love has to be behind it. If the love is
[1:21:17] not there, it's not going to work.
[1:21:22] So we have to cast down doubt. This
[1:21:27] person doesn't look worthy. This person
[1:21:29] doesn't look eligible. This person
[1:21:31] doesn't enter into the worship service.
[1:21:33] They just sit there in a bump in a log.
[1:21:35] Lord, I've lost all my faith to believe
[1:21:38] you could do anything for them. Um, they
[1:21:42] just must not be
[1:21:44] left. But we are we respector of
[1:21:47] persons? Do we think the person that
[1:21:48] jumps and shouts for some reason is more
[1:21:50] spiritual? Do we think that uh there's
[1:21:53] some eligibility by our works? Here we
[1:21:56] have a a testimony of people who
[1:21:57] fervently prayed and didn't feel like
[1:21:59] they were availing anything with God. So
[1:22:02] I would say it's not in some outward
[1:22:04] measure that we need to be drawing our
[1:22:08] in
[1:22:09] judging. But if you respect to persons
[1:22:12] ye commit sin and are convinced of the
[1:22:17] law as transgressors. For whatsoever
[1:22:20] shall keep the whole law and yet
[1:22:22] offended one point, he is guilty of it
[1:22:24] all. So now he's
[1:22:28] saying you broke the cardinal rule.
[1:22:31] You've judged others and now your faith
[1:22:34] is not effective. And church, we want to
[1:22:37] be effective. And one thing that will
[1:22:40] absolutely kill your faith and belief is
[1:22:42] when you sit in the seat of scornful and
[1:22:44] condemn others. Matter of fact, how you
[1:22:46] judge deterns exactly where you're
[1:22:49] standing and where your what your
[1:22:50] position is. And if you take yourself
[1:22:52] from out from underneath the blood, then
[1:22:54] you are out from underneath the blood.
[1:22:56] If you take others out, you're out from
[1:22:58] underneath the blood. You don't want to
[1:23:00] ever put yourself in the position where
[1:23:02] you have neutralized your own faith by
[1:23:07] being drawn off sides by
[1:23:09] condemning. That's going to take the
[1:23:11] victory right out of your life.
[1:23:13] So we don't want to do
[1:23:16] that.
[1:23:18] James
[1:23:21] 3:9, therewith bless we God, even the
[1:23:24] father, and wherewith curse we men,
[1:23:26] which are made in the simultude of
[1:23:29] God. So that's the thing, right? They're
[1:23:33] in the image of God. We're all children
[1:23:36] of God. So it's easy to say, "God,
[1:23:40] you're God." And then now we've esteemed
[1:23:44] our fellow man as something less than
[1:23:48] being made in the very image of
[1:23:50] God. And and I I would say this has deep
[1:23:55] application. This is something that uh
[1:23:57] if people were to search themselves,
[1:23:59] they wouldn't say the things they say.
[1:24:01] They wouldn't joke. They wouldn't be
[1:24:03] mean. They wouldn't belittle.
[1:24:09] they we'll get there. Lord, help me. All
[1:24:13] right. So, we want to recognize that it
[1:24:16] for the sake of being an effective
[1:24:18] soldier. We're going to keep our hearts
[1:24:20] pure. We're we're not going to we're not
[1:24:22] going to uh become critical of people
[1:24:25] and we're going to take the side that
[1:24:28] they are God's children made in the
[1:24:30] image of God. That's the similitude is
[1:24:32] the image of God.
[1:24:34] And you know the the thing that is the
[1:24:38] shift here right is I want you to
[1:24:41] understand as you judge others is going
[1:24:43] to give you the confidence right in your
[1:24:47] it's going to be the victory by which
[1:24:49] you judge yourself worthy okay because
[1:24:52] you cannot condemn others and then go
[1:24:54] before God and not be condemned okay so
[1:24:59] just if you find that in your heart is
[1:25:02] ought against anyone make it right. Get
[1:25:05] rid of it. Forgive them. Uh put them as
[1:25:09] count them worthy of the price that was
[1:25:11] paid at Calvary because you didn't pay
[1:25:13] the price. He did.
[1:25:16] And
[1:25:18] that's God so loved the world, right? So
[1:25:21] yeah, John 36 3:16. For God so loved the
[1:25:25] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:25:27] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:25:30] not perish but have everlasting life.
[1:25:33] For God sent not his son into the world
[1:25:35] to condemn the world, but that the world
[1:25:37] through him might be saved. Well, God,
[1:25:40] I'll do the condemning for
[1:25:43] you. You didn't. I
[1:25:46] will. That's not the attitude. Jesus
[1:25:50] would say himself in the book of Matthew
[1:25:53] 7 1-3, "Judge not that ye not that ye be
[1:25:57] not judged. For what judgment ye judge,
[1:26:00] ye shall be judged. And with what
[1:26:03] measure ye might, it shall be measured
[1:26:05] to you again. Grace, Lord, Lord, I want
[1:26:09] grace. I'm gonna give grace. Lord, I
[1:26:11] want mercy. I'm going to give mercy.
[1:26:13] You're telling me I have an opportunity
[1:26:15] to to sow goodness, to seow grace, to
[1:26:17] sew mercy, and it could be met unto me,
[1:26:20] Lord. Then I'm going to be the one
[1:26:21] that's believing for the mercy and grace
[1:26:23] of God. This is a principle that that
[1:26:26] could make our faith effectual.
[1:26:28] Now, brother Brandon would tell the
[1:26:30] story of blind Barnameus and I, you
[1:26:33] know, I just was pondering on that. You
[1:26:36] know, he was a beggar and brother
[1:26:39] Brandon would say that he had a
[1:26:40] 10-year-old daughter, maybe let's just
[1:26:42] say 13 year years old. And now this is a
[1:26:45] daughter of a
[1:26:48] beggar. Okay? I don't think it would be
[1:26:50] hard to understand that she's not going
[1:26:52] to be a girl with with a lot of means.
[1:26:55] Okay? And and um I just was pondering on
[1:26:59] this as brother Brandon would take the
[1:27:00] liberty to tell the story. He he would
[1:27:02] talk about how blind Barameus had a lamb
[1:27:06] and they didn't he would say they didn't
[1:27:08] have dogs in those days, but he had a
[1:27:09] lamb and that lamb meant everything to
[1:27:11] him because it was his service animal.
[1:27:13] It's how he got around. He would go use
[1:27:15] the lamb to find his way to the gate so
[1:27:17] he could sit outside of Jericho and beg.
[1:27:20] And and um that's the way it was. And
[1:27:23] because he was a beggar, he had to get
[1:27:25] up early and go to to beg and then he
[1:27:28] would come home. And I imagine he was
[1:27:29] going early hours before the sun would
[1:27:31] come up. He was starting to make his way
[1:27:33] out so he could be there as the as the
[1:27:35] traffic would come in and and then he
[1:27:37] would need to be there at the end of the
[1:27:39] day as the traffic went out. And so he's
[1:27:41] the last to to the first to come and the
[1:27:45] last to go. It's like if you're working
[1:27:47] at the fast food restaurant, you had the
[1:27:49] opening and close shift every day.
[1:27:54] And this is because he loves his family
[1:27:57] and his only means of providing is that
[1:28:00] he can bring the money home and deb it
[1:28:04] out and then they would have some money
[1:28:06] to spend for food the next day. And
[1:28:09] that's blind Barnameus's
[1:28:11] reality. Now the young girl that brother
[1:28:16] Brandham says that he had I'm just going
[1:28:20] to give her a name. I'm going to call
[1:28:21] her Karen because I think that's an
[1:28:23] awful fitting name because we like to
[1:28:27] stigmatize a Karen. We like to call
[1:28:30] someone a Karen. Well, it just so
[1:28:32] happens that blind barted's daughter's
[1:28:35] name is
[1:28:37] Karen. And she doesn't have a lot of
[1:28:39] material goods. She actually gets picked
[1:28:43] on quite a bit when she goes to
[1:28:45] school.
[1:28:48] And you know, she's just treated
[1:28:52] differently. Her family isn't like one
[1:28:56] of the ones of prestige who's able to
[1:28:59] donate lambs. And really, they could
[1:29:01] just give out of their
[1:29:03] abundance. No sweat off their back. But
[1:29:06] they're religiously privileged. Their
[1:29:07] days are not tied up with work. They're
[1:29:10] not laboring from sun up to sun down.
[1:29:14] They have options.
[1:29:17] They don't have to ride the
[1:29:20] bus. But Karen was a bus
[1:29:24] rider because she didn't have another
[1:29:27] place to go. She didn't have family to
[1:29:29] drag her around. She had to be with her
[1:29:37] peers. The other thing
[1:29:40] about her is obviously she was loved.
[1:29:45] She was a You're not going to find this
[1:29:46] in the quotes,
[1:29:49] brother.
[1:29:50] But blind
[1:29:52] Barnameus loving his daughter, she got
[1:29:55] sick and he told the Lord that if she
[1:29:58] would get well, he would offer the
[1:30:09] lamb. And Karen being made well, she'd
[1:30:14] actually always wanted to go to the
[1:30:15] temple and see a sacrifice and to see a
[1:30:18] worship. Something she always wanted to
[1:30:21] do, something that was done every day.
[1:30:24] There was an offering of a lamb, a
[1:30:25] yearling lamb every day. And there was
[1:30:28] those who everybody knew where the lamb
[1:30:30] came from, but they never had the
[1:30:33] opportunity to go. They never had a
[1:30:34] lamb.
[1:30:36] and yet realizing what it would mean to
[1:30:38] her family. There was a part of her that
[1:30:39] was like, you know what? This is my
[1:30:41] chance. This is my
[1:30:42] opportunity. I'm going to get to go and
[1:30:45] go into the courts of
[1:30:46] Jehovah and we're going to offer the
[1:30:49] lamb. And as they're making their way
[1:30:51] with everything that they had, there was
[1:30:53] those that were like,
[1:30:56] "Really? Look at
[1:31:00] that. They're not religious." Matter of
[1:31:03] fact, I you know, just for a I I would
[1:31:05] imagine that she probably had
[1:31:07] hand-me-down clothes, probably from her
[1:31:10] cousins, and maybe just she didn't own a
[1:31:12] skirt. Maybe her cousins were all boys,
[1:31:14] but her mom did her best to kind of make
[1:31:16] her look right. So, just maybe she
[1:31:17] showed up in the wrong
[1:31:19] attire, but she'd never been to church
[1:31:21] before. She wasn't in a religious
[1:31:24] family, but now they're going to go give
[1:31:26] their
[1:31:28] all. And brother Brandham in the this is
[1:31:31] a quote you can find. It's in God's
[1:31:33] provided way. I believe this is maybe
[1:31:35] what it might have looked like for her
[1:31:37] to go into
[1:31:38] church. A modern view of that. Now, the
[1:31:44] Arkansas people is not the most stylish
[1:31:47] people. Forgive me. This is brother
[1:31:49] Brandham. I like hiding behind our
[1:31:52] prophet. He's saying this. If you could
[1:31:56] put it up and make sure everybody knows
[1:31:57] this is brother Brandham.
[1:32:02] 530613. Sorry, I don't have a paragraph
[1:32:04] number. Maybe it's towards the beginning
[1:32:06] of the service. You Arkansas people.
[1:32:08] There that
[1:32:09] is. There it is. The Arkansas people is
[1:32:13] not the most stylish people in the
[1:32:15] world, but they're some of the best in
[1:32:17] the world. They're humble. They haven't
[1:32:19] got much of the world's goods. I've seen
[1:32:22] young ladies 16 years old come in the
[1:32:26] meeting. Me sitting back somewhere
[1:32:32] praying. I usually stay in prayer before
[1:32:35] coming to the meetings, see them come
[1:32:37] packing their shoes and stockings under
[1:32:40] their arm and then get down there and
[1:32:43] brush off their shoes and feet and put
[1:32:45] them on the shoes and go into the
[1:32:47] church.
[1:32:49] have to make that one pair last a long
[1:32:51] time. You
[1:32:56] know, I guess there's people right in
[1:32:58] here that's done the same
[1:33:01] thing. I I wonder if we're
[1:33:04] catching this is a natural way we judge
[1:33:07] one
[1:33:09] another's. This is the way we may give
[1:33:12] esteem. And I don't think we're actually
[1:33:15] guilty of
[1:33:17] this, but I want to bring it
[1:33:22] around.
[1:33:24] Now, they offered that
[1:33:28] lamb and they felt the presence of the
[1:33:30] Lord draw nigh. It was one of the
[1:33:34] greatest memories and events that she
[1:33:37] had ever had in her
[1:33:39] life. But there was just one problem.
[1:33:42] When they were done, they had no more
[1:33:53] land. Thankful there's a rest of the
[1:33:56] story. Brother Brandham would say after
[1:33:58] he offered that lamb, God had provided a
[1:34:01] lamb. We're not without a lamb. So, just
[1:34:06] take the time. And we're going to read
[1:34:09] Mark
[1:34:15] 10:46-52. And he come to Jericho. And as
[1:34:18] he went out of Jericho with his
[1:34:19] disciples, and a great number of people,
[1:34:22] blind Barnameus, the son of the Tmus,
[1:34:25] sat by the
[1:34:27] highway side begging. And when we heard
[1:34:30] that there was Jesus of Nazareth, he
[1:34:32] began to cry out and say, "Jesus, thou
[1:34:36] son of David, have mercy on me." And
[1:34:38] many charged him that he should hold his
[1:34:41] peace. But he cried the more a great
[1:34:44] deal. Thou son of David, have mercy on
[1:34:47] me. And Jesus stood still and commanded
[1:34:49] him to be called. And brother Brandon
[1:34:52] would give us insight that Jesus did not
[1:34:54] hear his physical voice. There was too
[1:34:57] much of atonemental. He was too far away
[1:35:00] even to the point that Jesus would have
[1:35:01] to bid him to come. And I'm pretty sure
[1:35:04] that if he was within shouting distance,
[1:35:06] that wouldn't had to have been done. But
[1:35:09] there had to be an effort made now. I'm
[1:35:11] being called for there's someone who's
[1:35:14] calling. Bring them unto me. So there's
[1:35:18] people who participated in this. They're
[1:35:20] now creating the atmosphere in the way
[1:35:22] that blind Barnameus can get to
[1:35:25] Jesus. And reading from 49. And Jesus
[1:35:27] stood still and commanded him to be
[1:35:29] called. And they called the blind man,
[1:35:31] saying unto him, Be of good comfort.
[1:35:33] Rise, he calleth thee. And he cast away
[1:35:36] his garments, rose, and came to Jesus.
[1:35:39] And Jesus answered, and said unto him,
[1:35:41] Wilt thou I should do unto thee? The
[1:35:44] blind man said unto him, Lord, that I
[1:35:47] might receive my sight? And Jesus said
[1:35:50] unto him, Go thy way. Thy faith hath
[1:35:53] made thee whole. and immediately he
[1:35:56] received his sight and followed Jesus in
[1:35:59] the
[1:36:00] way. I'm thankful that God had provided
[1:36:03] a
[1:36:05] lamb. That's God's provided
[1:36:09] way and he's likened us to sheep. All we
[1:36:13] like sheep have gone
[1:36:16] astray. I wonder why anybody ever raised
[1:36:20] a sheep. Well, you know that a sheep is
[1:36:22] the most helpless thing in the world
[1:36:25] when it's lost. It just can't find its
[1:36:27] way home at all. Is that right? Sheep
[1:36:31] raisers. And I've helped raise them
[1:36:33] myself out in the west western prairie
[1:36:36] and them a
[1:36:38] many. Here it
[1:36:41] is. But notice sheep when it's lost,
[1:36:45] he's lost. He'll just stand there and
[1:36:47] bleet. That's all. the wolves will come
[1:36:50] get him. Unless a shepherd does come to
[1:36:53] him, that's the way it is with us. When
[1:36:56] we're lost, we're absolutely hopeless
[1:36:57] unless the shepherd comes and gets us.
[1:37:00] I'm glad tonight God's got a shepherd
[1:37:02] over his sheepfold. Aren't you? That
[1:37:04] when we call, he's always hears and and
[1:37:07] we like sheep have gone astray so that
[1:37:10] wandering out. But God laid upon him the
[1:37:14] iniquity of us all.
[1:37:17] How that on one man the iniquity of the
[1:37:21] world was laid. All the sin, all the
[1:37:24] sickness, all everything that was wrong
[1:37:27] was laid upon one
[1:37:29] sheep, God's provided lamb. and he took
[1:37:33] him up to Calvary and crucified him, the
[1:37:36] substitute for our
[1:37:39] wickedness and our sickness and our
[1:37:42] transgressions and all that we've done
[1:37:45] against God and we've done against
[1:37:49] ourselves. He was God's provided
[1:37:53] sacrifice, God's provided way. Now, God
[1:37:56] has always had a way. He's got one
[1:37:59] tonight. God always before he sends
[1:38:03] judgment, he always makes a way of
[1:38:05] escape. Out of every trial, God makes a
[1:38:07] way of escape. And God makes before he
[1:38:09] sends
[1:38:11] judgment, he make he sends mercy. And if
[1:38:14] you spend spur mercy, there's nothing
[1:38:17] left but judgment. You've judged
[1:38:23] yourself. You've always made your
[1:38:25] judgment.
[1:38:27] So I would say we have the power to
[1:38:30] judge.
[1:38:32] And in judging what even the communion
[1:38:34] scripture, judge yourselves that ye be
[1:38:36] not judged. I judge myself as needing
[1:38:39] the lamb. I I I I need
[1:38:42] it. I'm glad it's it's the price paid.
[1:38:46] And my faith is not resting on anything
[1:38:48] else except what Calvary accomplished.
[1:38:53] And that's what I want you to realize is
[1:38:55] this. We may not be guilty of looking at
[1:38:59] someone else as a Karen, but I think we
[1:39:01] do ourselves that way.
[1:39:04] What we actually do is we judge
[1:39:06] ourselves unworthy. We judge ourselves
[1:39:09] as not being the one who he died for.
[1:39:12] And then it's a subtle thing because
[1:39:14] it's really a false humility. What's it
[1:39:16] got to do with you anyways?
[1:39:21] He paid it all. What's your faith
[1:39:23] resting in?
[1:39:25] It ain't you.
[1:39:28] Or judge yourself worthy and see where
[1:39:31] that gets you.
[1:39:34] You know, you watch how you build there
[1:39:38] on gonna uh just
[1:39:44] read. By faith, Abel offered unto God a
[1:39:47] more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by
[1:39:49] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:39:51] righteous. God testifying of his gifts,
[1:39:54] and by it he being dead, yet speaketh.
[1:39:58] Whoso, and this is in John, whosoever
[1:40:00] believeth in Jesus Christ is born of
[1:40:02] God, and everyone that loveth him that
[1:40:05] begat loveth also that is begotten of
[1:40:08] him.
[1:40:10] If you're born of God, you love those
[1:40:12] born of God.
[1:40:18] By this we know that we love the
[1:40:20] children of God when we love God and
[1:40:22] keep his commandments. For this is the
[1:40:24] love of God that we keep his
[1:40:25] commandments and his commandments are
[1:40:26] not grievous. For whatsoever is born of
[1:40:29] God overcometh the world, and this is
[1:40:31] the victory that overcometh the world,
[1:40:33] even our
[1:40:38] faith. Faith is a revelation. Faith is a
[1:40:41] substance. Faith is an atomic
[1:40:45] bomb. Faith is the
[1:40:48] victory. And I and I want us to
[1:40:51] recognize our faith,
[1:40:54] especially in the season that it's in
[1:40:57] the beautiful prophecy of Isaiah. We'll
[1:41:00] just read it as the musicians would
[1:41:02] come. Isaiah 53.
[1:41:08] Who hath believed our report?
[1:41:15] Is the lamb worthy?
[1:41:18] Are we resting in anything else?
[1:41:23] And to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:41:25] revealed? For he shall grow up before
[1:41:28] him as a tender plant and as a root out
[1:41:30] of the dry ground. He hath no form nor
[1:41:33] cominglinness. And when we shall see
[1:41:36] him, there is no beauty that we should
[1:41:38] desire him. He is despised and rejected
[1:41:41] of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted
[1:41:43] with grief. And we hid as it were our
[1:41:46] faces from him. He was despised, and we
[1:41:49] esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne
[1:41:52] our griefs, and carried our sorrows, yet
[1:41:54] we did esteem him stricken, smitten of
[1:41:56] God, and afflicted. But he was wounded
[1:41:59] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[1:42:02] for our iniquities. The chastisement of
[1:42:05] our peace was upon him, and with his
[1:42:07] stripes we are healed. All we like sheep
[1:42:10] have gone astray. We have turned
[1:42:12] everyone to his own
[1:42:14] way. And the Lord hath laid on him the
[1:42:18] iniquity of us all. He was oppressed,
[1:42:21] and he was afflicted, yet he opened not
[1:42:23] his mouth. He was brought as a lamb
[1:42:25] before the slaughter, and as a sheep
[1:42:27] before the sheers, is dumb, so he opened
[1:42:29] not his mouth. He was taken from the
[1:42:32] prison and from the judgment and was sh
[1:42:34] who shall declare his generation. I
[1:42:36] believe there's a people here that can
[1:42:39] declare he was cut off out of the land
[1:42:42] of the living for the transgression of
[1:42:44] my people. He was stricken and he made
[1:42:47] his grave with the wicked and with the
[1:42:48] rich in his death because he had done no
[1:42:50] violence. Neither was any deceit in his
[1:42:53] mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[1:42:55] him. He was put him to grief. And thou
[1:42:59] shalt make his soul an offering for sin.
[1:43:02] He shall see his seed and shall prolong
[1:43:06] his days. The pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:43:09] prosper in his hand. He shall see of the
[1:43:12] travail of his soul, and shall be
[1:43:15] satisfied by the
[1:43:16] knowledge. Shall my righteous servant
[1:43:20] justify many. He shall bear their
[1:43:25] iniquities. Therefore will I divide him
[1:43:27] a portion with the great and he shall
[1:43:30] divide the spoil with the strong be
[1:43:33] because he hath poured out his
[1:43:35] soul. There's that pouring out unto
[1:43:38] death and he was numbered with the
[1:43:41] transgressors and he bare the sin of
[1:43:43] many and made the intercession for the
[1:43:47] transgressors. That's our identity.
[1:43:51] That's our
[1:43:52] attributes. We take on that inner we we
[1:43:55] feel that. And I'm thankful that he's
[1:44:00] the lamb is my
[1:44:02] identity. We're not left without a lamb.
[1:44:06] We have the ID to take the
[1:44:08] flight. It's going to take us home,
[1:44:10] saints. We don't have to have faith in
[1:44:12] anything
[1:44:13] else. You could stand as the musicians
[1:44:16] may find something to play.
[1:44:21] just want to clench it with
[1:44:24] this wouldn't have time to go into
[1:44:26] perfect faith and read something
[1:44:29] but one of the secrets to making faith
[1:44:32] effectual as we mentioned is love and we
[1:44:35] recognize that we have no standing
[1:44:37] outside of
[1:44:38] Christ. I believe that does something
[1:44:41] for
[1:44:42] us. No man could come to the father
[1:44:45] except the father draws him.
[1:44:48] And God came down in that muck what you
[1:44:51] were and sought you out and brought you
[1:44:53] out. That ought to create a perfect
[1:44:55] love. Look what you was and look what
[1:44:58] you are. What did that? Somebody that
[1:45:01] loves you. Can't you have faith in what
[1:45:04] he promised you then? Real genuine love
[1:45:07] will create a confidence in his word. He
[1:45:10] caught me when I was nothing. I'm still
[1:45:13] nothing, but I'm in his hand. So he
[1:45:17] caught me. He loved me when I was
[1:45:19] unlovable. He loved you when you was
[1:45:22] unlovable. But he changed you just like
[1:45:26] the color sister said that time in her
[1:45:29] testimony. She said, "I'm not what I
[1:45:31] ought to be. I'm not what I want to be,
[1:45:32] but I'm not what I used to be." She
[1:45:34] knowed she had come somewhere. Something
[1:45:37] happened. And that's the way it is. If
[1:45:39] God, when I was an alien from him, so
[1:45:42] loved me till he stooped down to get me
[1:45:44] and picked me up. That gives me
[1:45:46] confidence that he wants to use me. He's
[1:45:49] got a purpose in doing it. He's seen
[1:45:51] something in me. He's seen something in
[1:45:54] you. He had a reason to save you. Look
[1:45:57] at the people that's unsaved today. Look
[1:45:59] at the millions. He could have took
[1:46:02] beside you. He could have took you.
[1:46:04] Amen. No one can take your
[1:46:07] place. You're in God's
[1:46:09] economy. No one can do it. That's his
[1:46:13] love to you.
[1:46:15] Let's just go to him. Heavenly Father,
[1:46:18] we're thankful for your word, Lord, that
[1:46:20] it tells us you love us. And Lord, it's
[1:46:24] the simplicity of taking you at your
[1:46:25] word and having faith in what you've
[1:46:27] said that you're pleased. Lord, while
[1:46:30] you may move in powerful ways, our faith
[1:46:33] is going to be built on nothing less
[1:46:35] than what you've declared us to
[1:46:38] be. You've declared us to be spotless.
[1:46:41] You've declared us to be righteous,
[1:46:44] Lord, because you've dressed us in your
[1:46:46] righteousness, Lord. If we were to look
[1:46:48] and judge ourselves after this flesh, we
[1:46:51] can't change our spots, Lord. There's no
[1:46:54] worthiness in this flesh. But now, we're
[1:46:57] called the sons and daughters of God.
[1:47:00] How grateful we are, Father, for the
[1:47:02] finished work of Calvary.
[1:47:04] May you just accomplish what needs to be
[1:47:07] accomplished by these words. Father, to
[1:47:08] your glory, in the precious name of our
[1:47:11] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:47:14] Amen. This is an old song. Maybe you
[1:47:16] could help me sing
[1:47:18] it. Uh the verses kind of have a a
[1:47:21] meter, so we need some
[1:47:25] belters. Uh faith is the victory.
[1:47:35] All right. Encamped along the hills of
[1:47:39] light, ye Christian soldiers,
[1:47:43] rise and press the battle air. The night
[1:47:47] shall build the glowing
[1:47:50] skies against the foe and bells below.
[1:47:55] Let all our strength be heard.
[1:47:59] Faith is the victory we know that
[1:48:03] overcomes the world. Oh, faith is the
[1:48:09] victory. Faith is the
[1:48:13] victory. Oh, glorious victory that
[1:48:18] overcomes the His banner. His banner
[1:48:23] over us is the our sword, the word of
[1:48:27] God.
[1:48:28] We tread the road of saints above with
[1:48:32] shouts of
[1:48:35] triumph. By faith they like a
[1:48:38] whirlwind's breath swept over every
[1:48:42] fear. By faith by which they conquer
[1:48:46] death they still are shining shield. Oh
[1:48:51] faith is the victory.
[1:48:55] Great is the
[1:48:58] victory. Oh, glorious victory that
[1:49:03] overcomes the
[1:49:05] world. On every hand
[1:49:08] of drawn out with
[1:49:12] dread,
[1:49:14] let be left behind and onward to the
[1:49:19] frame.
[1:49:21] Salvation's helmet and homage hand with
[1:49:25] truth
[1:49:27] abound. The earth shall tremble our
[1:49:31] tread and echo with our shout. Oh faith
[1:49:37] is the
[1:49:38] victory. Faith is the
[1:49:42] victory. Oh glor is victory that
[1:49:47] overcomes.
[1:49:49] This is a verse for us. To him that
[1:49:52] overcomes the Lord by
[1:50:01] praise his
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:08] name. Our
[1:50:12] hearts will vanquish all the hosts of
[1:50:16] night in Jesus concrete day. Oh, faith
[1:50:22] is the
[1:50:24] victory. Faith is the
[1:50:28] victory. Oh, glorious victory that all
[1:50:33] sing forsaken. Oh, and to him that
[1:50:37] overcomes the pra shall be
[1:50:42] given before the angels he shall know.
[1:50:47] His name confess in
[1:50:50] heaven that onward from the hills of
[1:50:54] life our hearts will love a flame. Oh
[1:50:58] will angry
[1:51:01] soulome Jesus conquering. Oh my faith is
[1:51:08] the
[1:51:09] victory. Faith is the victory.
[1:51:14] Oh, glorious victory that overcome God.
[1:51:19] Oh, and faith is the
[1:51:24] victory. Faith is the
[1:51:28] victory. Oh, glorious
[1:51:31] victory. Sing it one more time. Oh, and
[1:51:36] faith is the victory.
[1:51:43] Oh, and all the glorious victory that
[1:51:48] overcomes
[1:51:49] the
[1:51:52] hallelu beyond this
[1:51:55] flesh that you can see
[1:51:58] now. Oh, beyond all
[1:52:02] weaknesses of this realm. Oh, there is a
[1:52:07] connection.
[1:52:10] Oh, oh, and with the other
[1:52:17] side. Oh, and I don't know how. Oh, and
[1:52:22] I don't know.
[1:52:24] Oh, I cannot
[1:52:26] explain all the love of God.
[1:52:31] Oh, and down inside of me when I hear
[1:52:36] the word. Oh, and my heart I'm sure glad
[1:52:40] your heart just believes in
[1:52:42] it. Oh, I say
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:48] amen. Oh, and beyond this
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:54] flesh, cast it out.
[1:52:57] Oh, beyond all
[1:53:00] weaknesses of this rank. Oh, there is a
[1:53:06] good holy
[1:53:08] invisible. Oh, and with Jesus
[1:53:15] Christ, I know
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:21] your I cannot explain.
[1:53:25] for the love of God.
[1:53:28] Oh, and on inside of me when I hear the
[1:53:34] word, oh my heart
[1:53:40] says, oh
[1:53:43] I just sing it one more time.
[1:53:48] Oh his
[1:53:51] flesh that you can see now.
[1:53:55] our
[1:53:57] weaknesses of this friend. Oh, there is
[1:54:01] a good
[1:54:05] hallelu. Oh, and with Jesus
[1:54:12] Christ. I don't know how. And I don't
[1:54:17] know why. Oh, I cannot
[1:54:21] explain the love of God for my soul
[1:54:25] poured out inside of me. When I hear a
[1:54:31] word, my heart
[1:54:33] says,
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:37] "Amen." I say,
[1:54:41] "Amen."
[1:54:43] Hallelujah. Amen. I trust you enjoy the
[1:54:46] word tonight. Amen. And it's that six
[1:54:48] sense that it it's not something you
[1:54:51] try. It's it's God-given faith inside of
[1:54:55] a believer that you can hear the word
[1:54:58] and no matter what the circumstances
[1:55:00] are. And that's what our brother was
[1:55:01] talking. You don't let the word go to
[1:55:03] the natural channel, the thinking and
[1:55:06] the reasoning and the adding and the
[1:55:09] subtracting and the figuring out. know
[1:55:11] there's a part of you that's from
[1:55:13] eternity that just received the word and
[1:55:16] said, "I don't know how this is going to
[1:55:17] happen.
[1:55:19] How did you get saved? I don't know how
[1:55:21] this is going to happen. I I'm in sin
[1:55:24] and I'm in trespass and I'm here. I'm
[1:55:27] I'm all convicted and all of those
[1:55:29] things, but something is telling me
[1:55:32] about this word of God and I'm hearing
[1:55:34] and something within my heart is
[1:55:37] responding. It's not made for the flesh.
[1:55:40] It's meant for that inner man inside of
[1:55:42] you to receive that word and it will
[1:55:44] bring about the changes that are needed.
[1:55:47] Amen. And that's why I believe with all
[1:55:49] my heart when we see somebody if you
[1:55:52] yourself has really been touched by God
[1:55:54] the judgment. It doesn't matter how far
[1:55:57] they've gone. There's something inside
[1:55:59] of you that can testify the same thing
[1:56:02] and say that I don't care how fast they
[1:56:04] gone. You can never any living human
[1:56:07] being you can never count about
[1:56:11] as long as they still have breath in
[1:56:13] their body. There's something in you
[1:56:15] that said there's a living God. And the
[1:56:18] worst they sin is, the worst God is
[1:56:20] there. He can come and change them. He
[1:56:23] He's looking for those. And you can look
[1:56:25] at them and say, "Oh, I wonder what a
[1:56:27] great miracle God can do for them."
[1:56:31] It It's not you that's speaking. It's
[1:56:33] him inside of you that's speaking.
[1:56:36] But without that, it's just human
[1:56:38] reasoning.
[1:56:40] We we not made to to walk by the flesh
[1:56:42] and by I love what our brother said.
[1:56:44] It's not by the feelings and oh I feel
[1:56:47] so spiritual that oh the atmosphere is
[1:56:49] just right today. No the question is
[1:56:51] what is the word says? What what did he
[1:56:53] say? I like that the even when we read
[1:56:55] it but the B says the word is the sign
[1:56:58] for the believer.
[1:57:01] Why are you so rejoicing? Well because
[1:57:03] his word said I'm healed already. So, it
[1:57:06] really doesn't matter how many more
[1:57:07] symptoms I get. If the already the word
[1:57:10] already said I'm healed, I'm healed. I'm
[1:57:14] walking by the word of God. My faith
[1:57:17] comes from the word of God. I'm I it
[1:57:20] doesn't matter what what I have, I don't
[1:57:23] have. What the word says belong to me.
[1:57:25] I'm walking in it. Why am I judging
[1:57:29] myself capable or able to receive it?
[1:57:32] Because there was a lamb that was
[1:57:34] sacrificed.
[1:57:36] I I love that the blind minded mayors
[1:57:40] had to give what he had in order for him
[1:57:43] to receive something.
[1:57:45] Sometimes we're holding on to our lamb.
[1:57:47] Oh, this is the only lamb I got. Then
[1:57:49] this is the only job I have and this is
[1:57:52] the only thing I have and and it's it's
[1:57:54] it's keeping you away from the real lamb
[1:57:57] that's already given.
[1:58:00] Oh, this this is if I don't get this
[1:58:02] education or if I don't do this. And and
[1:58:05] as you following that, you following
[1:58:08] your lamp, it's keeping you away from
[1:58:10] church. It's keeping you away from the
[1:58:12] things of the It's keeping you away from
[1:58:15] the real lamb.
[1:58:19] I I believe it's we a life of a believer
[1:58:22] is a life of
[1:58:24] sacrifice. Without a sacrifice, there's
[1:58:26] no life. It's a life of laying down all
[1:58:29] the time. If it's for God, we lay down
[1:58:32] everything. Why? Because he laid it all
[1:58:35] down so we can lay down everything and
[1:58:37] receive what he laid down.
[1:58:40] We We can't try to balance out our
[1:58:42] lives. Oh, I got to hold on to my lamp
[1:58:44] and then get God's lamp. No, you got to
[1:58:46] lay down your lamp so you can receive
[1:58:49] his lamp.
[1:58:52] I love
[1:58:53] that. Uh well, if you work 10 more
[1:58:57] hours, you're going to get more money.
[1:58:58] Well, you know what? I'll give up that
[1:59:00] lamp. I'll come do the service. I'll
[1:59:03] come and then God will provide for my
[1:59:05] needs. It's him that get me this job.
[1:59:08] It's him who provided for me. He will
[1:59:10] provide for me tomorrow. In fact, he
[1:59:12] will provide for me today until
[1:59:15] eternity. This other lamb is only
[1:59:17] temporarily. You give him 10 years, the
[1:59:19] other that lamb will die. But this lamb
[1:59:22] is an eternal lamb. This lamb will
[1:59:24] provide you the healing, the finance,
[1:59:26] everything that you have need of. It's
[1:59:30] in that one lamb. But yet, we hang on to
[1:59:32] our lamb and our little lamb and we try
[1:59:35] to keep him alive forever. No, I want to
[1:59:38] give it up. I want to come and say,
[1:59:40] Lord, I'm accepting the lamb that you've
[1:59:42] offered. I'm here this morning. I don't
[1:59:44] count myself worthy, but there's a
[1:59:46] worthy lamb that's laying on the altar.
[1:59:49] I will come and I will take I will take
[1:59:51] what you have provided. You said the
[1:59:53] blood was given so we can come under
[1:59:56] that blood and receive of you. I trust
[1:59:59] that your heart desire tonight. Oh God,
[2:00:02] just come by our way. And whatever my
[2:00:04] lamb is, I want to lay it down tonight,
[2:00:06] Lord. And may you just come and and take
[2:00:10] my life, Lord. Let it become your life
[2:00:13] because you laid your life. You said if
[2:00:15] you live, we shall live also. So I
[2:00:17] believe with all my heart that if I died
[2:00:20] today for you, I will receive my life
[2:00:23] once again because you said that what's
[2:00:25] been what what was yours, you spent it
[2:00:29] gladly so we can rejoice in that. Amen.
[2:00:32] But my Thomas, if you could just come
[2:00:34] and dismiss us tonight. So if you have a
[2:00:36] need upon your heart as our brother will
[2:00:38] pray, just lift your hand up to him so
[2:00:41] he can hear your prayer and know what
[2:00:43] you have need of tonight. Amen.
[2:00:49] Let's bow our
[2:00:52] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:00:56] we're so grateful for that sacrifice on
[2:01:02] Calvary. Lord, the blood that was shed,
[2:01:06] Lord, means everything to us, Lord.
[2:01:11] Because we realize, Lord, that without
[2:01:14] it, we're
[2:01:18] nothing. But with it, we can do all
[2:01:23] [Music]
[2:01:25] things. Lord, we just pray that you
[2:01:29] [Music]
[2:01:33] would continue to use
[2:01:36] your people to fulfill your word, Lord
[2:01:39] God.
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:44] Just grateful,
[2:01:49] grateful for Calvary.
[2:01:55] Lord, our faith in that shed blood is
[2:01:57] our victory. Hallelujah.
[2:02:01] We just want to tell you that we love
[2:02:04] you. We thank you for
[2:02:06] this word this evening, Lord God.
[2:02:10] May we hide it in our hearts, Lord God,
[2:02:13] and not take it
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:17] lightly, Lord. I'm reminded of one
[2:02:22] that was told that he needed to be more
[2:02:25] sincere. Yes.
[2:02:29] Lord, a prophet
[2:02:32] messenger. How much more
[2:02:35] should the rest of your bride, Lord God,
[2:02:38] be sincere, Lord? We
[2:02:40] sincerely love you. Want to serve you
[2:02:44] and please
[2:02:47] you. May we be found doers of your
[2:02:52] word. We've been hearers tonight, Lord
[2:02:55] God. But may
[2:02:57] we go out into the highways and byways
[2:03:00] and seek which that which is lost.
[2:03:07] May we not judge anyone unworthy of the
[2:03:11] sacrifice that you made
[2:03:14] but may we extend mercy and grace to
[2:03:18] all. Be with us as we go on our way. We
[2:03:22] love you and thank you in Jesus
[2:03:27] name.
[2:03:30] Amen. Amen. Don't forget there's a a
[2:03:34] quick choir practice for those that are
[2:03:35] going to camp. And so God bless you at
[2:03:38] this
