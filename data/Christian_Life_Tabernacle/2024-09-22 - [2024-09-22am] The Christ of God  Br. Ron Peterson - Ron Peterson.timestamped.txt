[47:05] grace and comfort of the Lord's their
[47:07] portion I I enjoyed the the testimony
[47:11] this morning of sister Grace you know
[47:14] and I thought sitting in my office you
[47:17] know the pressure that uh they must have
[47:21] been under you know to have a car broke
[47:24] down and then the other car gets wrecked
[47:26] and you don't got nothing and you throw
[47:28] your hands up and you just don't know
[47:31] what you're GNA do but you know it's
[47:34] it's that pressure that molds you and
[47:37] makes you and uh uh so you know I just I
[47:41] just feel like that anyway I'd like to
[47:45] um brother Ron's with us this morning my
[47:48] friend for many years I meant back in
[47:51] the early
[47:52] 70s um I think that's over half a
[47:55] century ago I'm not sure brother Ron but
[47:59] anyway uh we've been serving the lord a
[48:01] long time together his wife's with us
[48:04] sister Sandy where you at s you stand
[48:13] up the Lord's really been super good to
[48:17] Sister Sandy we appreciate it you know
[48:20] uh we go back to a lot of stories but um
[48:26] you know
[48:27] one time Lesley and I we we we lived in
[48:31] Flagstaff with Ron and Sandy and we had
[48:34] a little trailer house out on Lake Mary
[48:37] Road and uh uh so we went to we went to
[48:44] at Christmas time to take the the
[48:46] grandkids I think we had a couple at
[48:49] that time to uh U see the
[48:54] grandparents and in that weekend that we
[48:57] were gone there was a great big freeze
[49:00] in Flagstaff and the trailer we were in
[49:03] all the pipes broke well um the landlord
[49:08] of that uh he locked us out of our
[49:11] trailer and uh so we had no place to go
[49:16] and
[49:17] um so we we got back late at night and
[49:20] we had no place to go so we called Ron
[49:23] and
[49:24] Sandy and so we said ma'am we're out
[49:27] here Lake Mary Road we have no place to
[49:29] go and they had a little
[49:31] one-bedroom uh house you know and so we
[49:36] ran over there to sleep and you know uh
[49:41] and I know you're all thinking that you
[49:43] know they just got out of their bed and
[49:45] gave us their bed no they let us sleep
[49:48] on the living room
[49:49] floor but we appreciated it
[49:53] brother we appreciated it was nice to
[49:56] get out of the cold and have a place to
[49:58] lay our heads and and we were thankful
[50:01] as could be that we had a friend that we
[50:03] could call in the middle of the night
[50:05] and we're just young kids you know and
[50:09] uh I remember we didn't have all Lesly
[50:12] could take out of the trailer with some
[50:14] diapers now in our day we didn't have
[50:18] Pampers we had cloth diapers you know
[50:20] that's what diapers were they were a
[50:23] piece of cloth and so Sandy let us use
[50:26] her wash machine and lesie put her
[50:29] diapers in there and washed the diapers
[50:31] and somehow when she opened up the wash
[50:35] machine all the diapers were nothing but
[50:38] strings of
[50:39] rags and and I mean we just didn't know
[50:43] what in the world uh we were ever going
[50:47] to do I mean we were just at our our wit
[50:50] end but you know I'm glad when you come
[50:53] to that time that you're at your witch
[50:55] end that God has got people that are
[50:57] praying for you amen and he's got people
[51:00] that are are standing there with you and
[51:05] and know what it's feel feels like to go
[51:09] through things and our messenger told us
[51:11] he says we go through these schools of
[51:13] suffering that we might know how the
[51:16] other person
[51:17] feels you know it it's really it's it's
[51:21] not about us it's about him and it's
[51:24] about how we reflect him him to other
[51:28] people and and that's that's the
[51:31] wonderful thing and and you know you
[51:34] just think someone just opening their
[51:38] house to you at your time of need you
[51:41] wouldn't think it' have an impact but it
[51:44] it had a long lasting impact because I
[51:47] knew he loved me and I knew I loved him
[51:49] and those bonds will carry you over
[51:52] through life so I encourage you make as
[51:55] many
[51:57] love bonds as you can with the Saints
[52:00] and reach out to the Saints see what you
[52:03] can do one for another and and and that
[52:07] that's what's going to hold us together
[52:09] because they're going to know that you
[52:11] are my
[52:13] disciples by your love one for another
[52:16] so let's stand this morning and I'm
[52:18] going to invite my friend to come

[1:01:04] everything but I remember one time just
[1:01:06] to tell you a story uh I was in
[1:01:10] Frankfurt Germany with brother Roald and
[1:01:12] there was a brother came from South
[1:01:14] Africa and so I had never met him before
[1:01:18] and so he got off the plane and God
[1:01:20] bless you God bless you brother he says
[1:01:23] yes I I knew knew you I've met you
[1:01:27] before and I've been a few places and I
[1:01:30] said no no I'm sorry brother and I my
[1:01:34] mind is going through every channel
[1:01:36] where did I meet him where did I see him
[1:01:39] oh no we met
[1:01:42] before ah I just don't think so brother
[1:01:46] and then he said yes before the
[1:01:49] foundation of the
[1:01:51] I I said you got
[1:01:54] me I said yes
[1:01:56] that is true Revelation
[1:02:01] 19 veres
[1:02:06] 9-10 and he saith unto me
[1:02:09] right blessed are they which are called
[1:02:11] under the married supper of the
[1:02:14] lamb and he saith unto
[1:02:16] me these are the true sayings of
[1:02:20] God and I fell at his feet to worship
[1:02:24] him and he said unto
[1:02:27] me see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:02:32] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[1:02:35] the testimony of
[1:02:37] Jesus worship
[1:02:39] God for the testimony of
[1:02:44] Jesus is the spirit of
[1:02:48] Prophecy may God add the blessing to his
[1:02:51] word you all may be seated this morning
[1:02:53] in the presence of God
[1:02:59] for the
[1:03:02] testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit
[1:03:07] of
[1:03:07] Prophecy let me just paraphrase this
[1:03:10] that if God were to send a prophetic
[1:03:12] word in this day and you have the
[1:03:14] testimony of
[1:03:16] Jesus you will see the prophetic word
[1:03:19] for this hour why you're ordained to see
[1:03:22] it you're predestinated to see it and if
[1:03:25] you're elected of God you can't help but
[1:03:28] see it thank God for that turn with me
[1:03:32] to John 1:1 give you a couple more
[1:03:34] scripture before we give you the title
[1:03:36] and the direction now I'm preaching
[1:03:40] from my laptop which I never do but I
[1:03:45] just I I am not a technically Advanced
[1:03:48] guy I just just learned cut and paste
[1:03:52] and normally have my sermons printed out
[1:03:54] I told Brother David I said do you have
[1:03:56] an electrical plugin up here in case I
[1:03:59] run out of power and this thing shuts
[1:04:02] off and he said then you know
[1:04:06] David if that happens brother Ron just
[1:04:09] out of the abundance of your okay God
[1:04:14] knows so it says here I have an hour and
[1:04:18] 50 minutes left on my battery so we'll
[1:04:23] try to get done before that
[1:04:28] Hallelujah I just feel comfortable this
[1:04:30] morning and I love him with all my heart
[1:04:33] I'm thankful you know Brother David and
[1:04:35] I go way back a long ways and we're
[1:04:38] still
[1:04:39] here
[1:04:41] amen we both found the same
[1:04:48] Barber
[1:04:51] anyway the Lord has blessed us with a
[1:04:55] good friendship
[1:04:56] ship as a brother in Christ I appreciate
[1:04:59] you Brother David God bless you richly
[1:05:02] Luke excuse me John 1: 40-41 then we'll
[1:05:07] go to Luke chapter 9 amen John 1 verse
[1:05:12] 40 one of the two which heard John speak
[1:05:15] and followed him was Andrew Simon
[1:05:18] Peter's brother and he finded first his
[1:05:20] own brother and saith unto him we have
[1:05:24] found the Messiahs
[1:05:26] which is being
[1:05:28] interpreted the Christ notice we have
[1:05:32] found the
[1:05:34] Messiah being
[1:05:36] interpreted the
[1:05:38] Christ turn with me to Luke Chapter n
[1:05:42] Luke 9: 18-
[1:05:47] 21 Luke 9 verse 18 and it came to pass
[1:05:52] as he was alone praying his disciples
[1:05:54] were with him
[1:05:56] and he asked them saying who say the
[1:05:59] people that I
[1:06:01] am they answering said John the Baptist
[1:06:05] but some say Elias and others
[1:06:08] say that one of the old prophets is
[1:06:11] risen
[1:06:13] again and he said unto them but whom say
[1:06:17] ye that I am now notice he's taking it
[1:06:20] from who do they say now to who do you
[1:06:25] say making it
[1:06:29] personal and he said unto them but whom
[1:06:32] say ye that I am and Peter answering
[1:06:36] said the Christ of
[1:06:40] God and he straightly charged them and
[1:06:43] commanded them that they tell no
[1:06:45] man that thing why you can't give
[1:06:49] anybody a revelation it takes God to
[1:06:53] Open the Eyes of your heart amen father
[1:06:57] God I thank you for this word I pray
[1:06:58] your blessing upon it speak to everyone
[1:07:01] this morning and receive glory and honor
[1:07:03] and all that we do and say we pray for
[1:07:06] your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:07:10] amen I'd like to title this sermon this
[1:07:13] morning the Christ of
[1:07:16] God and it's such a vast subject that
[1:07:20] really
[1:07:21] I uh feel that you could only touch the
[1:07:25] tip of the iceberg but uh there is
[1:07:30] such or so much that could be said but
[1:07:34] we'll try to bring it down to something
[1:07:37] that will hold us here for just an hour
[1:07:40] or so and then we'll come back this
[1:07:42] evening and perhaps go on just a little
[1:07:44] bit further I'd like to touch uh upon a
[1:07:49] subject this morning and going in a
[1:07:52] direction we have found
[1:07:55] the Christ for this
[1:07:58] hour I want you to all understand that
[1:08:01] all of you the very reason that you were
[1:08:02] here this
[1:08:05] morning is because there is a Common
[1:08:09] Thread that links all of us together and
[1:08:12] that is called the message of the
[1:08:15] hour that is God's doing that is not
[1:08:17] man's
[1:08:19] doing and
[1:08:21] so this that you have come into
[1:08:27] is the Christ of God now let me expound
[1:08:31] on this for just a little bit this
[1:08:35] morning now we know that there are many
[1:08:40] titles for God you see it all through
[1:08:42] the
[1:08:43] scriptures they called him God they
[1:08:45] called him Lord they called him the word
[1:08:48] they called him the Son of God they
[1:08:50] called him the firstborn from the dead
[1:08:52] the beginning of the creation of God the
[1:08:55] image of God the express image of his
[1:08:58] person they began to call him the son of
[1:09:00] man the son of David the last Adam the
[1:09:03] captain of Salvation and it goes on and
[1:09:06] on and
[1:09:07] on and so all of these many names that
[1:09:11] was given to him were there to express
[1:09:14] the mediatorial office of the Lord as a
[1:09:17] mediator he
[1:09:19] stands between God and
[1:09:22] man and revealing the father to man and
[1:09:26] expressing the true
[1:09:29] revelation of man to God so we all
[1:09:34] understand that brother Brennan preaches
[1:09:36] one
[1:09:38] of the one of the most amazing sermon
[1:09:41] they're all amazing but there are
[1:09:43] certain ones that stand out Christ The
[1:09:47] Mystery of God
[1:09:49] revealed he did not come here to reveal
[1:09:53] himself right he says I have come and I
[1:09:59] can do nothing except the father show me
[1:10:03] and they said show us the father he said
[1:10:05] have I been so long with you how many
[1:10:08] sermons do I got to
[1:10:10] preach how often do I have to say these
[1:10:13] things is it that you're not catching
[1:10:16] that I and my father are one if you've
[1:10:18] seen
[1:10:20] me you've seen the
[1:10:22] father Hallelujah I begin
[1:10:25] to think on these things and I began to
[1:10:28] look at this through the
[1:10:30] scriptures the Bible says in Luke
[1:10:34] 2:11 For unto you is Born This Day in
[1:10:38] the city of David a savior which is
[1:10:41] Christ the Lord in Acts
[1:10:47] 2:36 therefore let all the house of
[1:10:49] Israel know assuredly that God hath made
[1:10:52] that same Jesus whom you have crucified
[1:10:56] if both
[1:10:58] Lord and
[1:11:00] Christ now brother Brenham says in
[1:11:03] questions and answers
[1:11:05] 1953 see no one has ever seen God but
[1:11:10] the next thing we begin to see by the
[1:11:12] eyes of Supernatural
[1:11:15] looking we now see a little white light
[1:11:19] forming out there what is it that was
[1:11:22] called To You Bible readers the
[1:11:26] logos or the anointed or the
[1:11:31] anointing it is that part of God that
[1:11:34] began to develop into something so human
[1:11:37] beings could have some kind of an idea
[1:11:41] of what it
[1:11:42] was and that was the word of
[1:11:46] God
[1:11:48] Amen he says in the sermon why and just
[1:11:51] hang on let me lay a little bit of a
[1:11:54] foundation then if God will help me I'll
[1:11:57] begin to
[1:11:58] preach he says now when he was here on
[1:12:01] Earth speaking of Jesus he said I come
[1:12:05] from God and I go to God that's
[1:12:09] right well when he died buried
[1:12:11] resurrected and ascended on high we
[1:12:14] realize that God that logos that Pillar
[1:12:16] of Fire that followed the children of
[1:12:19] Israel through the Wilderness that was
[1:12:23] Christ that was the anointed
[1:12:26] now my subject is the
[1:12:29] Christ of God I want you to understand
[1:12:32] the word Christ is never used in the Old
[1:12:36] Testament it's only found in the New
[1:12:42] Testament now we begin to see this
[1:12:46] quickening power that God is going to
[1:12:49] use for you to understand him because
[1:12:54] our Bible is aose
[1:12:56] book God does not reveal himself except
[1:13:00] to his elect and to whom he
[1:13:03] chooses why is it that you chose to
[1:13:06] speak Parables to the people and Jesus
[1:13:09] said because unto them somebody say them
[1:13:13] he said it's not
[1:13:15] given he said but to you it's
[1:13:19] given I want you to understand that the
[1:13:22] sovereignty of the revelation of God
[1:13:25] about his word is
[1:13:29] Sovereign and he just doesn't give it to
[1:13:33] you haphazardly right God gives it to
[1:13:37] you for a reason there's a
[1:13:42] purpose so I began to ponder over this
[1:13:46] and as I've been
[1:13:47] studying for quite some time even on
[1:13:50] this Christ of God brother Brenham
[1:13:54] throughout multitudes I even studied
[1:13:57] this morning
[1:13:58] multitudes of his sermons he's talking
[1:14:02] about God being
[1:14:05] identified the identified Christ of all
[1:14:08] the ages identified with Christ and it
[1:14:11] goes on and on and on all of these about
[1:14:14] one subject and that is the
[1:14:18] identification of Christ down Through
[1:14:21] the
[1:14:23] Ages you know brother brother Brenham
[1:14:25] tells us he says
[1:14:29] God wants you to catch the revelation of
[1:14:32] the hour in which you
[1:14:35] live that you might see the word of God
[1:14:38] for what God has done in this
[1:14:41] hour now we can see Christ in the Old
[1:14:43] Testament
[1:14:45] prophets let me give you an
[1:14:49] example he says we can see Christ in
[1:14:52] David
[1:14:56] we can see him speaking under anointing
[1:14:59] he said what was that that was Christ in
[1:15:01] David are you following me we can see it
[1:15:05] in Jeremiah Ezekiel
[1:15:09] Isaiah every one of them as they began
[1:15:11] to be moved upon by an anointing right
[1:15:15] understand this anointing this thought
[1:15:17] this
[1:15:18] logos this revealing now would come upon
[1:15:21] them and they would speak as though it
[1:15:24] was them
[1:15:26] and it wasn't them it was
[1:15:28] Christ the anointing in
[1:15:31] them many times they
[1:15:33] thought that they were speaking of
[1:15:36] themselves because they spoke in first
[1:15:38] person
[1:15:40] singular understand and you can find
[1:15:43] this out in the the sermon it's one of
[1:15:46] the smallest sermons that brother BR
[1:15:48] preaches discernment of
[1:15:51] spirit and he says now notice that every
[1:15:55] time that Christ spoke through the Old
[1:15:57] Testament Christ the anointing the
[1:16:01] anointing anoints a man of God he speaks
[1:16:05] he will say hear ye my people for I the
[1:16:08] Lord will bless he's speaking in first
[1:16:11] person
[1:16:12] singular so we all understand that but
[1:16:16] let's let's fast forward it down to the
[1:16:18] 20th century into this hour and why is
[1:16:22] it that so many people when the Christ
[1:16:25] of God Came Upon This prophet and he
[1:16:27] prophesied I'll ride this Trail one more
[1:16:30] time amen they want to make it brother
[1:16:34] brandham right they want to make a
[1:16:36] return ministry as even we find in the
[1:16:39] New Testament well who do you say that I
[1:16:42] am Thou Art Jeremiah one of the Old
[1:16:44] Testament prophets where does return
[1:16:47] Ministry come from from way back that's
[1:16:51] not a new doctrine in this
[1:16:53] hour but if you understand that when God
[1:16:56] anoints a
[1:16:58] minister and he speaks under that
[1:17:01] anointing he's speaking by divine
[1:17:05] inspiration can we say Amen to
[1:17:08] that
[1:17:11] now brother Bram said the devil is not
[1:17:16] afraid of a historical God right come on
[1:17:22] you can talk about Jesus in a mang
[1:17:25] come on you can talk about the Christ
[1:17:28] child you can sing old child of
[1:17:31] Bethlehem you can worship Him of 2,000
[1:17:35] years
[1:17:36] ago and the devil will let you he'll not
[1:17:39] bother you a bit as long as you keep him
[1:17:44] in the
[1:17:45] past but the moment that you rise Christ
[1:17:49] up out of historyall and realize do you
[1:17:52] realize that when this message came to
[1:17:54] to you it was the Christ of God coming
[1:17:58] and anointing you little did we know
[1:18:01] David that when we got a hold of those
[1:18:04] tapes and just a bunch of young kids
[1:18:07] didn't know what didn't know
[1:18:10] nothing little did we know it was life
[1:18:16] changing take us away from our
[1:18:19] families and our education
[1:18:24] and to leave California we were together
[1:18:29] I there was a tape list and somebody
[1:18:31] gave my brother and I and Mitch a tape
[1:18:34] list and so we only had a few bucks and
[1:18:38] we could only buy about 10 or 12 13
[1:18:41] tapes and in there was a tape that
[1:18:45] caught our
[1:18:46] eye single
[1:18:49] men we saw a tape that says choosing
[1:18:54] a
[1:18:58] bride we got David and a bunch of us
[1:19:01] together we got to his house put on the
[1:19:02] tape oh man we're having a a good time
[1:19:06] cuz brother BR said you better look that
[1:19:08] heer in the
[1:19:10] eye if she got that wild staring we're
[1:19:14] just laughing cuz here's a Kentucky
[1:19:16] hillbilly pardon me but if you can
[1:19:19] receive it here's in Kentucky hillbilly
[1:19:21] taking natural spiritual he said you
[1:19:24] better look at hepher in the eye if she
[1:19:26] got that wild stare don't you never buy
[1:19:28] her she'll never be a m a mamy to her
[1:19:32] cat he said so you better watch that
[1:19:35] woman you're thinking about
[1:19:37] marrying look her in the eye she got
[1:19:39] that wild
[1:19:40] stare and we're just laughing and we're
[1:19:42] having big time of course now brother
[1:19:44] Brenham has said a few things haha and
[1:19:47] got the people but right here at the end
[1:19:50] of the tape he says something that he
[1:19:51] normally doesn't say he says I've been
[1:19:54] trying to leave the
[1:19:55] pulpit several times now he said the
[1:19:59] steering wheel is out of my
[1:20:03] hand oh Capernaum o Capernaum thou city
[1:20:07] which calleth itself the City of Angels
[1:20:10] if the mighty Works have been done in
[1:20:12] you would have been done in Sodom Sodom
[1:20:14] and Gomorrah would and you know the
[1:20:17] prophecy repent Lo Angeles why he said
[1:20:20] judgment is ready to strike and he was
[1:20:23] just going on and here we were still in
[1:20:26] California and we didn't
[1:20:28] know we didn't know we're just a bunch
[1:20:30] of young
[1:20:34] kids and we were given now this and we
[1:20:38] hear it and Brother David can testify
[1:20:41] that we were on the floor we were crying
[1:20:45] we were on our knees oh God we didn't
[1:20:48] know where will we go we're from
[1:20:51] California I was born in Los Angeles
[1:20:57] where do we
[1:20:59] go oh my we just saying oh God be
[1:21:03] merciful to us and we just start hey
[1:21:06] within weeks within weeks we're selling
[1:21:09] we're getting rid we're this and that
[1:21:12] and we're leaving
[1:21:15] California little did we know that God
[1:21:18] would take
[1:21:20] us and keep revealing himself to us
[1:21:25] how much do I believe that La is going
[1:21:27] to
[1:21:30] sink I tell you it will sink it's thus
[1:21:33] sayith the
[1:21:34] Lord somebody asked me the other day cuz
[1:21:37] they asked did Brother Brenham say
[1:21:39] anything about La sinking before
[1:21:42] Resurrection I said yes there is one
[1:21:44] quote he said I believe before the
[1:21:46] coming of the Lord yes God will sink
[1:21:49] that
[1:21:50] place now when it sinks and it happens
[1:21:54] you will not have to wait for CNN or Fox
[1:21:58] News or anybody else to get on there and
[1:22:00] tell you oh there's let me tell you
[1:22:03] you'll feel the shaking right and it
[1:22:05] won't be at that time that you say oh
[1:22:08] God oh God make me real sincere oh god
[1:22:12] I've been playing I believe this is me
[1:22:15] now excuse
[1:22:17] me but I believe saints of God you
[1:22:20] should be
[1:22:21] Shook You should be prepared you're not
[1:22:24] waiting for something you're not waiting
[1:22:26] for LA to sink you're not waiting for
[1:22:29] all of these things why because the
[1:22:31] prophetic word will begin to compound
[1:22:34] itself there'll be prophetic word after
[1:22:37] prophetic word just last just like the
[1:22:39] last few hours of
[1:22:43] Calvary but we are being caught up right
[1:22:47] now he said the bride has only one
[1:22:50] judgment that's now somebody say now now
[1:22:54] and judgment
[1:22:56] begins at the house of God that's why we
[1:22:59] come to church not to see how good but
[1:23:02] to see where we fall short and God by
[1:23:05] his grace reveals to you you need to do
[1:23:08] better you need to be more sincere and
[1:23:11] you say oh God forgive me you know what
[1:23:14] he does he allows
[1:23:16] you oh thank God it's a self
[1:23:20] judgment we're being judged now Jud
[1:23:24] judgement begins at the house of God and
[1:23:27] the final
[1:23:29] separation will be the
[1:23:31] Rapture two in the field one taken two
[1:23:36] in bed one taken we're being caught up
[1:23:40] right now my brother the word rapture is
[1:23:43] not in the New Testament you can't find
[1:23:47] it but the Bible talks about being
[1:23:50] caught up together to meet
[1:23:52] him that word caught up
[1:23:55] in Greek is
[1:23:57] harpazo that means to intercept by
[1:24:02] force that means to catch something and
[1:24:05] when you get it get a hold of
[1:24:10] it you've been caught
[1:24:12] up you've been
[1:24:15] harpazo he grabbed a hold of
[1:24:19] you all of those that are my sheep will
[1:24:25] come to me and I'm not lost one of them
[1:24:29] God is not up in heaven ringing his
[1:24:31] hands worried about you because if he
[1:24:35] started a work in
[1:24:37] you he will finish
[1:24:40] it oh we all got our faults and our
[1:24:43] failures that's true that's got nothing
[1:24:46] to do with it you are called by grace
[1:24:50] through faith and thatall is not of
[1:24:53] yourself it is a gift of God lest any
[1:24:56] man
[1:24:57] boast
[1:25:00] Hallelujah we can see Christ in
[1:25:04] Adam Eve's
[1:25:07] Redeemer takes her unto himself we know
[1:25:11] that Adam had to quickly give her
[1:25:14] seed lest God kill
[1:25:17] her so he imparted to her
[1:25:22] seed we can see Christ in Moses in the
[1:25:26] Exodus he became God to the people we
[1:25:30] can see Christ in David a rejected King
[1:25:33] over
[1:25:35] Jerusalem we can see Christ in Boaz
[1:25:38] kinsman redeemer lord of the
[1:25:41] Harvest he redeems Ruth the Gentile
[1:25:45] bride we can see Christ in Joseph son of
[1:25:50] prosperity his brothers were jealous and
[1:25:53] he was a spiritual man Now understand
[1:25:56] something that when you look at the
[1:25:58] Christ of God in all of these they are
[1:26:02] portraying a portion of God's Great
[1:26:06] Redemptive plan they're playing their
[1:26:09] part of the Great
[1:26:12] drama now for just a second when you see
[1:26:16] Joseph has he's a spiritual man he has a
[1:26:19] dream God speaks to him in dreams he
[1:26:23] said and I
[1:26:24] oh I saw all of my brothers including my
[1:26:27] father and they were all bowing and
[1:26:29] bringing their sheaves you all know the
[1:26:32] vision well him being a immature
[1:26:35] Christian thinking all of them are going
[1:26:37] to accept his Revelation and the vision
[1:26:40] that he's gotten from God and they hated
[1:26:46] him David excuse me Joseph was given a
[1:26:50] vision of his life of what's going to
[1:26:53] happen but from the time of the Betrayal
[1:26:57] thrown into the pit Piper's wife to the
[1:27:02] right hand of
[1:27:03] pharaoh is a multitude of years and from
[1:27:08] the time of the vision until the
[1:27:09] prophetic word comes to
[1:27:12] manifestation it didn't look
[1:27:15] like God's going to bring this word to
[1:27:20] pass in fact I'm sure he said oh God
[1:27:24] your vision said but this sure don't
[1:27:27] look like the
[1:27:29] vision
[1:27:31] amen now brother Brena makes an an
[1:27:34] astounding statement he said when the
[1:27:36] bride of Christ begins to recognize who
[1:27:40] she
[1:27:42] is and what she stands
[1:27:46] for and he says and by God's spirit
[1:27:49] discern and
[1:27:51] withstand the two Spirits Within
[1:27:54] in the framework of the church we're not
[1:27:57] talking about out
[1:27:59] there we're talking about within the
[1:28:03] message I'm not here to talk doctrinal
[1:28:06] things here in fact I have found out
[1:28:10] through my Infinite Wisdom that God has
[1:28:12] given me I should say limited
[1:28:16] vision is to speak on things that we
[1:28:19] agree upon more than the things we
[1:28:21] disagree upon one says he he coming on a
[1:28:24] white cloud another said he's coming on
[1:28:26] a white horse brother R said who cares
[1:28:30] as long as we agree he's coming somebody
[1:28:32] say Amen to
[1:28:34] that amen I'd rather have a right spirit
[1:28:37] and wrong
[1:28:39] Doctrine than the right Doctrine and the
[1:28:41] wrong
[1:28:43] Spirit when the bride begins to line
[1:28:46] herself up with the scriptures she finds
[1:28:49] her
[1:28:50] position you're being moved
[1:28:55] you're being
[1:28:56] moved all of you your life is a
[1:29:00] journey Abraham go seek a city whose
[1:29:03] Builder and maker is God where do I go
[1:29:07] God just
[1:29:09] move I want all of you to understand
[1:29:12] that God is still moving
[1:29:14] you okay that God's Great GPS system has
[1:29:19] been watching over you your whole life
[1:29:23] you make a wrong move
[1:29:26] recalculating you move to the wrong City
[1:29:30] recalculating you go to the wrong church
[1:29:34] recalculating I want you to understand
[1:29:36] your life may recalculate many times but
[1:29:39] the destination Remains the
[1:29:42] Same God is going to get you to your
[1:29:47] destination
[1:29:49] regardless of your failures
[1:29:57] sometimes the wrong
[1:29:59] thing is the right
[1:30:03] thing because he'll use all things to
[1:30:07] work together for the
[1:30:10] good David was a man after God's Own
[1:30:13] Heart is that right he sees basba he
[1:30:19] lust he takes basheba he commits
[1:30:23] premeditated
[1:30:27] murder
[1:30:30] wow and yet and yet watch this it was
[1:30:34] still the plan of God though David did
[1:30:37] it
[1:30:39] wrong because God will use the
[1:30:42] wrong remember the first seed that came
[1:30:45] through basheba God took that baby David
[1:30:50] cried when God took that baby baby David
[1:30:54] quit crying washed his face and
[1:30:55] everybody said oh why he said no he says
[1:30:59] per Adventure that God would have
[1:31:01] allowed that child to live but God
[1:31:03] couldn't why it was
[1:31:07] wrong and did you know nowhere within
[1:31:10] the Bible does it ever say basba is the
[1:31:12] wife of
[1:31:14] David it says and
[1:31:17] David took unto him basba who was the
[1:31:20] wife
[1:31:21] of Uriah
[1:31:24] yet God used because out of
[1:31:28] basba and she's one of those used in the
[1:31:32] New Testament of the lineage of
[1:31:34] Christ and
[1:31:38] Tamar
[1:31:40] Tamar who dresses as a
[1:31:44] harlot under
[1:31:47] deception are you kidding me let me tell
[1:31:50] you quit looking at one another with
[1:31:53] carnal eyes
[1:31:55] quit looking well he did this he's out
[1:31:57] she did this she's out let me tell you
[1:32:00] when we get over there all of us are
[1:32:02] going to be maybe surprised oh you made
[1:32:07] it oh you made
[1:32:10] it and what's even going to be funnier
[1:32:13] is they're going to look at you and go
[1:32:15] you made
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:21] it cuz it's all going to be him
[1:32:26] God will use all things even wrong
[1:32:30] things to produce good didn't say all
[1:32:33] things would be
[1:32:35] good because he said he will use even
[1:32:38] bad to produce
[1:32:40] good
[1:32:42] now let me go
[1:32:46] on brother Brenham said in the angel of
[1:32:49] the Lord he said on the platform when
[1:32:52] someone meets me
[1:32:55] he said it's not me
[1:32:57] speaking listen when you hear my voice
[1:33:00] speaking when that inspiration is on now
[1:33:05] he's giving you an example they come up
[1:33:07] they meet me he said the inspiration is
[1:33:11] on him what is what inspiration is that
[1:33:14] the Christ of God are we together on
[1:33:18] that he says I have no more control of
[1:33:22] that than you know what you're going to
[1:33:23] to say next New Year's
[1:33:25] Day I have no control of that it speaks
[1:33:30] itself it's my
[1:33:34] voice and I'm listening to myself talk
[1:33:37] just as you're listening to me talk now
[1:33:39] I hear myself what it says to the
[1:33:42] people and sometimes take a hold of
[1:33:44] their hand I'll wait there for a
[1:33:47] while and after a while I'll hear what
[1:33:50] it
[1:33:50] speaks just myself speak talking to the
[1:33:54] people it's very strange feeling and
[1:33:56] under that
[1:33:58] anointing being that my services are so
[1:34:01] close together that it's best for me not
[1:34:03] to be too much under it at a time in one
[1:34:10] service now brother Brenham told Billy
[1:34:12] Paul he said
[1:34:14] Billy he says God has called you to work
[1:34:17] with me because my brothers physical
[1:34:20] brothers who were my managers would
[1:34:23] leave me me under the anointing too
[1:34:26] long and he says if I stay under the
[1:34:29] anointing too long he said I can't come
[1:34:31] back tonight to preach or the next day
[1:34:35] so I asked Billy Paul I had a chance to
[1:34:37] travel with brother Billy and Brother
[1:34:39] Joseph and take him around Europe and
[1:34:42] introduce him to pastors and
[1:34:44] churches so I said brother
[1:34:47] Billy your daddy said that you were
[1:34:49] called to work with him tell me some of
[1:34:52] those things
[1:34:54] tell me personal testimony of you had
[1:34:56] with your
[1:34:57] daddy he said daddy said I was called
[1:35:01] but he said even until I got converted
[1:35:05] he said no Billy you can't work with me
[1:35:07] till you get
[1:35:10] converted so he gets
[1:35:12] converted and I said how could you tell
[1:35:15] daddy's been under the anointing too
[1:35:17] long now this is what he told me how
[1:35:20] many of you have seen deep goth a deep
[1:35:22] in 20th century
[1:35:24] Prophet how many of you remember I
[1:35:26] forget which film it is Billy Paul walks
[1:35:28] across the platform he was a thin young
[1:35:32] man that time and he's looking at his
[1:35:34] daddy you see him go he's looking at him
[1:35:36] very
[1:35:38] closely and then brother renom continues
[1:35:40] to preach now here this is what Billy
[1:35:43] Paul told me he says I would be watching
[1:35:46] daddy and he says daddy would get under
[1:35:49] the anointing and he'd act like a drunk
[1:35:52] man
[1:35:54] he'd raise his
[1:35:55] foot he'd look around he'd wipe his
[1:35:59] face are you the Usher
[1:36:02] sir very very good because they always
[1:36:05] the angel stood to his right so they
[1:36:08] brought the people from the
[1:36:10] right towards the
[1:36:16] angel he said I see Daddy
[1:36:19] now he's had too much he said he would
[1:36:22] come up here come up here my brother
[1:36:24] come you yes
[1:36:26] come come
[1:36:28] here I'm just transforming you into
[1:36:30] brother brandham right
[1:36:33] now you're right
[1:36:35] here and now brother brandom excuse me
[1:36:40] now is under such an anointing but he
[1:36:42] says if I come up and I touch Daddy on
[1:36:45] his right hip like this with my right
[1:36:47] hand if brother Brenham says Billy let
[1:36:51] me go he would take his hand and tell
[1:36:53] touch Billy's and Billy would leave him
[1:36:56] in the
[1:36:57] Pulpit
[1:36:59] if that he he would fall back into
[1:37:03] brother brenham's arms and Billy would
[1:37:06] hold him
[1:37:07] up he would reach around and grab his
[1:37:11] Bible and he would look to the host
[1:37:14] Pastor I'm leaving now and take thank
[1:37:17] you man
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:25] the only way they could get brother
[1:37:26] brandom away from the people is put him
[1:37:28] in the
[1:37:29] car because many people come and steal
[1:37:33] brother Billy Paul told me he said I
[1:37:34] take him to the car put him in the back
[1:37:36] seat and I would drive away and daddy
[1:37:39] would lay down on the back
[1:37:42] seat and he says I could hear his voice
[1:37:45] in the the car from the back of the car
[1:37:49] sister in the red dress stand up God
[1:37:51] just healed you of the cancer brother
[1:37:54] you you had something on your heart
[1:37:56] stand up God is healing you God is
[1:37:59] giving you and on and he keeps calling I
[1:38:02] said why brother Billy he said because
[1:38:04] the anointing was still on him and if
[1:38:07] the prophet sought in a vision if he
[1:38:09] spoke it it would come to pass do you
[1:38:14] understand God was still operating the
[1:38:17] gift outside the building Hallelujah
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:26] then he he says then Daddy he come out
[1:38:30] from underneath the anointing he start
[1:38:33] crying
[1:38:35] Billy Billy take me home I'm so tired I
[1:38:39] I don't want to preach no more take me
[1:38:42] home
[1:38:43] Billy he said take me home I want to see
[1:38:46] Mom and the kids he said I just kept
[1:38:49] driving he says pretty soon he says
[1:38:53] daddy'd wipe his eyes he said Billy did
[1:38:57] we have a good service tonight oh yes
[1:39:00] daddy we had a good
[1:39:02] service he said how many more services
[1:39:04] do we got he said three or four he said
[1:39:08] take me to the motel he said we got we
[1:39:12] got work to
[1:39:13] do now understand the anointing leaves
[1:39:17] him he cries I'm done I don't want to
[1:39:20] preach no more I want to go home I felt
[1:39:23] that way many times huh oh just just let
[1:39:28] me go
[1:39:29] home and so I'll give you another
[1:39:32] interesting one how many of you have
[1:39:34] heard of sister
[1:39:36] Rosella Ro Rosella the converted
[1:39:40] alcoholic brother Brenham as you know is
[1:39:43] under the anointing he's calling people
[1:39:45] out and he said I see a woman up there
[1:39:48] she's uh she's the dance partner to Fred
[1:39:52] stair and there's a woman right next to
[1:39:55] her that the doctors have given her up
[1:39:58] as a wall light
[1:40:01] alcoholic are those things
[1:40:03] true well anyway you know how it goes
[1:40:06] and she got converted if any of you have
[1:40:08] ever met sister
[1:40:11] Rosella as they were going home that
[1:40:14] evening in the
[1:40:16] car this is what brother renham told
[1:40:19] Brother Billy Paul and he told me
[1:40:21] personally this is not on tape this is a
[1:40:24] personal one that brother Billy Paul
[1:40:26] shared with me he said
[1:40:29] Billy he said as far as God is concerned
[1:40:32] the meetings are over they've got two or
[1:40:35] three more
[1:40:37] meetings he said as far as God is
[1:40:39] concerned the meetings are over because
[1:40:42] I got the one God sent me
[1:40:47] after do you believe that God can do
[1:40:51] that that in a whole series and
[1:40:53] thousands of people he can call
[1:40:56] one let me tell you God loves you so
[1:40:59] much and he knew right where you were at
[1:41:01] and he had an appointment with you I
[1:41:04] don't care where you were at I don't
[1:41:05] care what you were doing you might have
[1:41:07] been washing dishes but when God calls
[1:41:10] you when he begins to open your eyes of
[1:41:13] understanding you begin to catch these
[1:41:15] things and God's moving you he started
[1:41:19] moving you then he's still moving you
[1:41:24] he's going to continue to
[1:41:27] move and they were moved by the Holy
[1:41:31] Spirit you are being moved by the Holy
[1:41:35] Spirit and God is quickening you
[1:41:38] preparing
[1:41:41] you by giving you Revelation Revelation
[1:41:44] becomes
[1:41:49] manifestation some saw a
[1:41:51] man some saw God
[1:41:54] he said it
[1:41:56] depends upon your
[1:41:59] attitude he says in the sermon faith I'm
[1:42:02] going to drop down this
[1:42:04] 1956 paragraph
[1:42:08] 79 God's Will by Divine
[1:42:12] gift only thing I do is just keep
[1:42:14] yielding myself and as I get myself
[1:42:17] completely yielded to the Holy Spirit
[1:42:20] then he starts talking
[1:42:23] not me he's using my
[1:42:26] voice but it's not
[1:42:30] me it's
[1:42:39] him could it be in this
[1:42:44] day watch watch how God
[1:42:47] operates you've got something on your
[1:42:50] heart a child a husband
[1:42:53] a promise something and you're seeking
[1:42:57] God in your prayer
[1:42:59] closet you're asking God remember me
[1:43:03] speak to me during the
[1:43:07] service and God knowing and Discerning
[1:43:10] the thoughts and intents of your heart
[1:43:13] at some time causes that minister to say
[1:43:16] something and you catch
[1:43:20] it and nobody else in the whole
[1:43:23] then the whole congregation knew why
[1:43:27] that Pastor said what he
[1:43:29] said but it was for
[1:43:32] you it was
[1:43:38] private and God giving you a
[1:43:44] word oh Heavenly
[1:43:48] Father how that we ask
[1:43:50] you to open our eyes eyes of
[1:43:54] understanding and let us
[1:43:56] see the moving of the Holy Spirit and
[1:44:00] God using a
[1:44:01] vessel and even unbeknown many time to
[1:44:06] the
[1:44:07] minister of who or why he said what he
[1:44:11] said or who he was saying it
[1:44:15] to and yet under the
[1:44:18] inspiration somebody was there it was me
[1:44:21] and many times after the Serv oh brother
[1:44:23] Ron praise the Lord thank you for that
[1:44:25] word you gave me what did I give
[1:44:28] you it wasn't me right it was him
[1:44:36] Amen in First Peter chapter 1 verses 20-
[1:44:43] 21 knowing this
[1:44:46] first that no Prophecy of the scripture
[1:44:49] is of any private interpretation
[1:44:53] for the prophecy came not in Old Time by
[1:44:56] the will of
[1:44:57] man but holy men of God spake as they
[1:45:00] were moved by the Holy
[1:45:03] Spirit now brother Bram said that the
[1:45:06] Holy Ghost is alone Holy Ghost alone is
[1:45:10] God's Divine interpreter of his
[1:45:14] word so you're not getting Revelation
[1:45:17] from the
[1:45:18] pastor from the
[1:45:21] preachers you're getting it from
[1:45:26] God the
[1:45:28] anointing upon Man became known as the
[1:45:32] word of the Lord now let me give you an
[1:45:34] example the Bible says and the word of
[1:45:36] the Lord came to
[1:45:39] Jeremiah if you type in
[1:45:42] parentheses in your computer in your
[1:45:45] bible program the word of the lord it's
[1:45:48] used
[1:45:49] 254 times and the word of the Lord came
[1:45:52] to Jeremiah came to Ezekiel came to
[1:45:57] Isaiah so I looked it
[1:46:01] up
[1:46:03] 234 times in the Old Testament and
[1:46:07] 257 times in the New Testament the word
[1:46:10] of the
[1:46:14] Lord in Hebrew word
[1:46:19] daar means the command a commune to
[1:46:22] speak speak to declare to pronounce to
[1:46:26] give a
[1:46:27] message duar the word a
[1:46:31] message Lord Jehovah the self-existing
[1:46:35] one so the word of the
[1:46:38] Lord is a message coming from
[1:46:43] Jehovah the first time it's used is in
[1:46:46] Genesis 15
[1:46:49] verse1 and after these things the word
[1:46:51] of the Lord came unto ABR in a
[1:46:54] vision saying fear not Abram I am thy
[1:46:57] shield and thy exceeding great reward
[1:47:00] and Abraham said Lord God What wilt thou
[1:47:03] give me seeing I go
[1:47:05] childless and the steward of my house is
[1:47:08] El eer of
[1:47:10] Damascus and Abram said behold to me
[1:47:13] thou has given no seed and lo one is
[1:47:17] born in my house is mine
[1:47:19] air see now I want you to understand he
[1:47:22] is he is debating with God
[1:47:27] Abram one in my house is born heir to me
[1:47:31] you haven't given me seed
[1:47:34] God and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:47:37] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[1:47:41] Heir who was that that was born
[1:47:45] first
[1:47:48] ishma and God had to correct Abraham
[1:47:53] because he said oh that ishmail might
[1:48:00] live he says no this shall not be thine
[1:48:04] air but he shall come forth out of thine
[1:48:07] own bowels and shall be thy ear so now I
[1:48:10] want you to understand this here as I
[1:48:12] try to wrap this up this
[1:48:14] morning this logos thought of God
[1:48:16] because in the beginning was the word
[1:48:18] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:48:19] with God and that logos light that came
[1:48:22] out now actually was God's thought God's
[1:48:26] thinking now brother Brenan preaches a
[1:48:29] sermon and he only preaches it one time
[1:48:32] but he uses the word multitudes of time
[1:48:34] in that sermon it's called spiritual
[1:48:40] Amnesia he said Amnesia is quite a thing
[1:48:44] it's a loss of knowing who you are or
[1:48:47] where you come
[1:48:49] from he gives reasons about it
[1:48:54] and so I want you to understand that
[1:48:57] when God deals with you by
[1:49:00] Revelation he's
[1:49:03] replacing your mind with his
[1:49:06] mind your thoughts with his thoughts and
[1:49:10] he's taking you back to where you
[1:49:13] were he's taking you back to familiar
[1:49:17] places I'm going to ask you a question
[1:49:20] have any of you ever been
[1:49:24] somewhere gone to a church been to
[1:49:26] somebody's home met somebody and all of
[1:49:29] a sudden you said I've been here
[1:49:32] before
[1:49:34] I I know this church I've seen it I know
[1:49:38] these
[1:49:39] people now we can call it Deja Vu or
[1:49:44] whatever but I want all of you to
[1:49:46] understand that you were with God in the
[1:49:49] mind of God before there was ever a
[1:49:52] foundation of this
[1:49:56] world therefore it makes you
[1:50:01] Eternal okay I'm I I'll share some of
[1:50:04] that with you this
[1:50:08] evening
[1:50:11] now let me give you another Bible
[1:50:13] example I'll probably close with this
[1:50:16] may take a 45 minutes to close but
[1:50:20] I'll I'll close with this
[1:50:23] 1 Samuel 3: 1 through
[1:50:28] 7 how many know Samuel was a prophet
[1:50:30] called to be a
[1:50:32] prophet and that child Samuel ministered
[1:50:35] unto the Lord before Eli and a word of
[1:50:39] the Lord was precious in those days and
[1:50:42] there was no open
[1:50:44] vision and it came to pass at that time
[1:50:46] when Eli was laid down in his place and
[1:50:49] his eyes began to watch themm and he
[1:50:51] could not see kind like a lot of the
[1:50:53] older ministers within the message
[1:50:56] without
[1:50:58] Revelation I'm just paraphrasing don't
[1:51:00] don't lock up on me I'm not I'm not
[1:51:03] preaching at anybody it's just
[1:51:07] types and a the lamp of God went out in
[1:51:10] the temple of the Lord where the Ark of
[1:51:13] God was and Samuel was laid down to
[1:51:15] sleep that the Lord called
[1:51:18] Samuel and he answered here am I and he
[1:51:23] ran to Eli and said here am I for thou
[1:51:26] CEST me he said I called not lie down
[1:51:31] again he went and laid
[1:51:33] down excuse
[1:51:35] me and the Lord called called yet again
[1:51:40] Samuel Samuel arose and went to Eli and
[1:51:43] said here am I for thou D call me and he
[1:51:46] answered I called not my son lie down
[1:51:50] again now Samuel did not yet know the
[1:51:55] Lord neither was the word of the Lord
[1:51:58] yet
[1:51:59] revealed unto
[1:52:02] him God
[1:52:03] calling
[1:52:05] him even though the word wasn't revealed
[1:52:08] to him watch this God called
[1:52:11] you before the foundation of the world
[1:52:15] but we need to go beyond calling because
[1:52:18] many are called and few
[1:52:20] are chosen
[1:52:23] right so I don't want you to just bubble
[1:52:26] dance and get all EXC I'm called God has
[1:52:29] called me I want you to go onto election
[1:52:32] and what is election
[1:52:37] adoption
[1:52:39] okay the word of the Lord has not been
[1:52:41] revealed to him but when Samuel has God
[1:52:45] revealed the word to him guess what he
[1:52:47] takes his position he comes in and now
[1:52:50] God see this is the this is the
[1:52:53] Inception of a prophetic
[1:52:56] ministry here like brother
[1:52:58] Brenham okay he said my first Bible that
[1:53:01] I read was
[1:53:03] nature I saw God in
[1:53:06] nature and he went and he didn't know
[1:53:08] God how many of you know the his first
[1:53:11] talking to God he wrote him a
[1:53:13] letter how many of you know that and he
[1:53:16] says I I I handw wrote the letter and I
[1:53:20] nailed it to a tree
[1:53:24] do you think God read his
[1:53:30] letter oh yes God read his
[1:53:34] letter do you think he understood about
[1:53:37] his strange
[1:53:39] birth why my parents told
[1:53:42] me my parents were not religious people
[1:53:45] my father was
[1:53:47] moonshine he said and they're coming
[1:53:49] through the little open window there in
[1:53:53] that little Log Cabin came an amber
[1:53:56] light stood over the
[1:53:57] bed my parents not a religious people he
[1:54:01] said but God was doing something they
[1:54:07] recognize that this was a proper
[1:54:12] child now he's
[1:54:14] carrying he does brother bandam little
[1:54:17] boy remember brother BR talks about life
[1:54:20] story here he says you know I remember

[2:05:55] know
[2:06:00] David amen don't you love the Lord

[2:06:17] Holy Spirit he's taking
[2:06:20] unbelief Carnel I ities and things in
[2:06:23] your life out and he says listen if
[2:06:26] you'll be more sincere in the time of

[2:06:30] pull remember the angel of the Lord said
[2:06:32] there's one thing you
[2:06:34] need be more
[2:06:36] sincere oh if he said that to him what
[2:06:39] about you and I
[2:06:41] Lord father as we have come here this
[2:06:44] morning before your
[2:06:48] people we recognize
[2:06:51] the Christ of God all down through the
[2:06:54] scriptures why cannot we recognize the
[2:06:57] Christ in us the mystery that's been hid
[2:07:00] down Through the Ages and yet now
[2:07:03] revealed for it is Christ in you the
[2:07:06] hope of glory father I thank
[2:07:09] you that you have revealed yourself to
[2:07:13] your people and you will reveal and you
[2:07:16] will
[2:07:17] continue and though we make a wrong turn
[2:07:20] God's Jeep
[2:07:22] PPS will
[2:07:26] recalculate and if you got to get a
[2:07:30] whale as we're thrown out of a ship and
[2:07:33] seem like All Is
[2:07:35] Lost and you have a private taxi to pick
[2:07:38] us up like you did
[2:07:40] Jonah spit us
[2:07:44] out not to tarus but
[2:07:49] Nineveh father God I thank thank you for
[2:07:52] your word I thank you for your people I
[2:07:56] pray that you will bless each and
[2:07:57] everyone take this little thought that
[2:07:59] we had and bless it to their
[2:08:03] hearts reveal yourself to us more and
[2:08:07] more for revelation will bring forth
[2:08:10] manifestation I thank you and I praise
[2:08:12] you I ask these things for your
[2:08:15] glory in Jesus Christ's
[2:08:18] name
[2:08:19] amen amen God bless you I turn the
[2:08:23] service back I'll see you this
[2:08:25] [Applause]
[2:08:27] [Music]
[2:08:35] even
[2:08:36] amen you know I think one of the
[2:08:39] greatest
[2:08:43] uh probably things that you realize is
[2:08:47] that you know it's hard to understand
[2:08:49] brother Ron talked about
[2:08:52] uh Billy Paul and the film that's over
[2:08:55] 75 years
[2:08:57] ago and very few of you are here 75
[2:09:01] years
[2:09:04] ago but yet the whole point of the
[2:09:07] matter is he's the same yesterday today
[2:09:10] and forever thank you Lord the god of
[2:09:13] the
[2:09:15] testimonies is the same God
[2:09:18] today the the when you you hear those
[2:09:22] things and your and you hear the stories
[2:09:25] of the great ministry that took place in
[2:09:29] our age it's to show you that he's the
[2:09:34] same yesterday today and forever and he
[2:09:38] has a testimony for your life he has
[2:09:41] things that he wants to do in your life
[2:09:44] he wants to be your God he wants to
[2:09:47] create and and have you have miracles in
[2:09:51] your life so I think the greatest thing
[2:09:54] that we should always remember is that
[2:09:57] we're not a people looking back to days
[2:09:59] that have gone by we're a people that
[2:10:01] are moving as God's word's been
[2:10:04] revealing we we've all been moving and
[2:10:07] what have we all been coming into we're
[2:10:09] coming into this bride that we are this
[2:10:12] image of Christ This Love Affair this
[2:10:16] word of God becoming personal to each of
[2:10:18] us and each of us finally taking our
[2:10:22] lives and and and looking at our own
[2:10:27] selves and saying I'm going to match my
[2:10:29] life up with the word of God this it may
[2:10:34] not be for everybody but it's for me you
[2:10:37] know I'm going to I'm going to I'm going
[2:10:40] to be this word that I
[2:10:43] heard it it's turned into many Believers
[2:10:47] all over the world and uh many different
[2:10:51] actions in different ideas in different
[2:10:54] interpretations but that that's not I
[2:10:58] I'm I don't care about that it's what it
[2:11:01] is to me personally and and I want the
[2:11:04] same God that I heard about I want to
[2:11:06] see him in my life I want to see him at
[2:11:09] my workplace I I want to I want to know
[2:11:12] he's with me and I I I hope that's what
[2:11:16] you can take away from this morning that
[2:11:19] as brother Ron I liked his GPS story
[2:11:23] your life may have taken some
[2:11:25] turns but he always brings you back as
[2:11:28] he promised I'll not leave you I'll not
[2:11:31] forsake you I'll be with you even in you
[2:11:34] till the end he said I I I'll I'll guide
[2:11:38] you my sheep hear my voice another they
[2:11:41] won't follow the footsteps of the
[2:11:43] righteous are ordered by the Lord you
[2:11:46] can take all these words everything
[2:11:48] that's been spoken and you can make it
[2:11:51] it's

[2:16:52] beli not just the laying on at the hands
