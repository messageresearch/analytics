[13:31] ly
[13:34] have Thanksgiving in our heart that
[13:37] you've been keeping us and you've been
[13:38] holding us Lord and even when our heart
[13:41] wasn't towards you
[13:43] you were looking out over our life too
[13:46] protect us Lord and bring us
[13:49] to the recognition to the revelation of
[13:52] who you are and who your person is Lord
[13:56] we're so thankful that we're living in
[13:57] the reality
[13:59] of the word that you've revealed in
[14:01] these last days Lord that it's not a
[14:04] Creed it's not a Dogma
[14:06] it's not some type of group
[14:09] conclusion but it's the revelation of
[14:12] your person to the individual
[14:14] Lord and to be laying in the presence of
[14:16] the son lord it's the greatest privilege
[14:18] that I've ever known
[14:20] to be free from sin and death and free
[14:23] from man's ideas and man's
[14:25] interpretation of the word but
[14:28] have direct access
[14:31] to you Lord and nothing in between Lord
[14:34] just to be able to have communion with
[14:36] you
[14:37] Lord may we look past the veil tonight
[14:40] and see you standing the same yesterday
[14:42] today and forever
[14:44] as your Prophet said the fivefold
[14:46] ministry is your dress where as you
[14:47] speak to your people move the man aside
[14:50] Lord
[14:51] and we could hear from you
[14:53] Lord may we just be in one mind and one
[14:55] spirit and one Accord
[14:57] we rebuke the devil that would try to
[14:59] hinder the moving of your spirit Lord we
[15:02] rebuke the infirmities In the Flesh Lord
[15:04] because by your stripes we are already
[15:06] healed so Lord May our faith just be
[15:09] lifted up into Heavenly places Lord if
[15:12] we can believe thou can'tst believe all
[15:15] things are possible Lord and we are that
[15:18] chosen bride that you've called in the
[15:21] end time to believe all things that can
[15:23] do the Greater Works Lord so we may we
[15:26] move aside from our perceptions and our
[15:28] ideas Lord we take signs with your word
[15:31] with what you said Lord that is our
[15:33] reality we deny the flesh we deny the
[15:36] five senses Lord we deny all those
[15:39] things and we say Amen to the word so

[24:58] of tools and cares
[25:02] but we have found the savior
[25:05] in the midst of all this confusion Lord

[25:15] that you will continue to strengthen us
[25:17] Lord God
[25:18] there have been so many wonderful
[25:21] messages that have come across this

[25:28] would have ears to hear
[25:30] I succeed
[25:32] Lord God that we will be doers of your
[25:35] word Lord God that we will take the word
[25:38] the voice that was spoken over this
[25:41] pulpit and apply it to our lives Lord
[25:44] God
[25:45] Monday through Friday Lord God that we
[25:47] would apply the word to our lives Lord

[26:02] so many different voices
[26:05] I pray that in the midst of this
[26:07] confusion that we would hear that one
[26:09] still small voice
[26:12] and that we will be faithful to you Lord
[26:14] God that when you return Lord God you
[26:16] might find us
[26:18] ready Lord God that you can say to each
[26:22] of us who are assembled here Well done
[26:24] thy good and faithful servant thou has
[26:27] been Faithful over a few things

[38:43] month they shall take to them every man
[38:47] a lamb according to the house of their
[38:49] fathers a lamp for a house
[38:53] and the blood shall be to you
[38:56] for a token upon the houses where they
[39:00] are where you are and when I see the
[39:03] blood I will pass over you
[39:06] and the plague shall not be upon you to
[39:10] destroy you while I when I smite the
[39:12] land of
[39:13] Egypt
[39:15] let us go to Genesis chapter 22
[39:21] verse 7 I'll be very fast because we are
[39:25] cruising this evening
[39:28] and as expect unto Abraham's father and
[39:31] say my father and he said here my my son
[39:34] and he said behold the fire and the hood
[39:36] but where is the Lamb for a bent
[39:39] offering and Abraham said my son God
[39:42] will provide himself a lamp for a bent
[39:45] offering so they went both of them
[39:48] together John chapter number 1 verse 29.
[39:52] the next day John said Jesus coming unto
[39:55] him and said Behold the Lamb of God
[39:57] which take away the sin of the world

[40:13] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[40:15] said on the throne a book written within
[40:17] on the backside suit with Seven Seals
[40:19] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[40:22] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[40:24] the book and to lose the seals thereof
[40:26] and no man in heaven or in Earth neither
[40:28] under the Earth was able to open the
[40:30] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[40:33] much because no man was found worthy to
[40:36] open the book and to read the book
[40:38] neither to look there on and one of the
[40:41] other said unto me weep not Behold The
[40:44] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[40:47] David has prevailed to open the book and
[40:50] to lose the Seven Seals thereof may God
[40:53] bless the reading of the word shall we
[40:54] pray Heavenly Father want to thank you
[40:56] this evening we have come once again to
[40:59] Feast upon your word we ask that you
[41:01] bless and sanctify this word in Jesus

[41:14] someone shout hallelujah

[41:20] can preach from 1947 to 1965 and this
[41:23] church you say Amen to the word
[41:26] what has brought us together is the
[41:28] message what will keep us together is
[41:31] the message what to separate us is the
[41:35] message so if you want to make me happy
[41:37] give me this message Hallelujah this
[41:41] church is not a Pentecostal church it's
[41:43] not a gathering of chickens this is a
[41:46] gathering of spiritual Eagles
[41:48] Hallelujah we are not feeding on the son
[41:51] of men but we are feeding on the body
[41:53] word of the son of man amen of Christ
[41:57] himself
[41:58] so
[42:00] I'm going to speak on the Supreme token
[42:02] this evening
[42:03] and uh
[42:05] I trust that the Lord will be of help so
[42:10] in the message token
[42:15] read this quote to you
[42:19] brother Branham says in the message
[42:20] talking 63 11 2 8
[42:24] evening message paragraph 42 he says a
[42:28] token he says the blood shall be unto
[42:32] you a token a sign according to Webster
[42:37] a sign of a prize that has been paid
[42:41] a token is the sign that a price has
[42:45] been paid
[42:46] so the token is not the price it is this
[42:50] sign that shows that the price has been
[42:53] paid
[42:54] are we together
[42:56] when you go to Zimbabwe where I come
[42:58] from
[42:59] there are certain shops they don't allow
[43:02] you to use the literal money that you
[43:05] have but you use certain coins that they
[43:09] call tokens
[43:10] for you to purchase what you want or in
[43:13] exchange of the dollar so that you are
[43:17] able to get whatever you want are we
[43:19] together
[43:20] so it's a sign that your money has been
[43:23] accepted in that shop
[43:25] so we are talking about design and we
[43:29] know
[43:30] because we don't have time I'll just
[43:32] rush to the word so the light
[43:36] going forth in the evening time that we
[43:39] are living in right now revealing Jesus
[43:42] Christ is the talking us today
[43:46] Hallelujah that's the true token and
[43:49] it's a positive token
[43:52] I don't just want a talking I want a
[43:55] true token because our God he is the way
[43:59] he is the word and he is the lamp he is
[44:03] the atonement himself what a perfect
[44:06] token for us in this hour now before you
[44:10] can have the token in the time of Exodus
[44:12] night you needed to have the blood
[44:15] if you didn't have the blood there was
[44:18] not talking for you
[44:19] for you to have the blood you ought to
[44:22] head the lamp
[44:23] Allelujah any other blood was acceptable
[44:27] if you had the blood of the Lamb and we
[44:31] thank God today that Christ has become
[44:34] the lamp again
[44:36] he was identified by John
[44:39] in the morning time as the Lamb of God
[44:42] that takes away the sin of the world so
[44:45] the lamp in the beginning is identified
[44:48] again as the lamb that was slain that
[44:51] came and took the book
[44:53] in other words the lamp in the beginning
[44:55] is the lamp in the end time
[44:58] the word in the beginning is the word in
[45:01] the end time the Target in the beginning
[45:03] is the token in the end time the holy
[45:07] ghost in the beginning is the holy ghost
[45:08] in the end time the bride in the
[45:11] beginning is the bright in the end time
[45:13] the cloud in the beginning is the cloud
[45:15] in the end time the message in the
[45:18] beginning is the message in the end time
[45:20] someone shouted the token
[45:22] Hallelujah so the lamb that was slain
[45:25] took the book and there's the blood for
[45:28] a token and I've got good news for you
[45:30] Texas this this evening the lamp is here
[45:35] if the lamp is here it means the blood
[45:38] is here
[45:39] if the blood is here it means the token
[45:42] is here if the token is here it is The
[45:46] Exodus is on
[45:48] Hallelujah
[45:49] Christ on Mount Sunset is here
[45:53] the revealed word is here
[45:56] the bleeding word is here
[45:59] the evening time is here
[46:02] Redemption Time Is Here therefore you
[46:05] can apply the token hallelujah it's
[46:09] gonna be good here tonight I can feel it
[46:11] already
[46:12] so at the time of Exodus God required a
[46:16] left for a house it was not just one
[46:19] lamp for one family member but it was a
[46:22] lamp for the whole house
[46:24] Jesus the Lamb of God sufficient was not
[46:28] sufficient for one family member but you
[46:31] are sufficient for Zacchaeus in his
[46:33] whole house he said this day is
[46:36] salvation come into your house it was
[46:39] what it was one Zacchaeus who repented
[46:42] it was one Zacchaeus who said if I've
[46:45] taken anything from you by false I'll
[46:47] return it fourfold but when the answer
[46:49] came from Jesus it didn't cover
[46:52] Zacchaeus alone it was ill and for the
[46:55] whole house
[46:56] it was one Rahab who received the lamb
[46:59] message it was one Rahab who received
[47:02] the tech boys it was one Rahab who
[47:04] received the coming king of Israel but
[47:07] she received
[47:10] so the blood of Jesus Hallelujah before
[47:14] I got there it was also one Cornelius
[47:16] who who had abandoned oh Jesus it was
[47:21] one Cornelius who prayed and when Peter
[47:23] came his whole house
[47:26] it was one Jacob who got convicted and
[47:30] who saw the power of God and he said
[47:32] what can I do to be saved and he says
[47:34] Paul says believe God that you and your
[47:38] house so it's a lamp for a house so your
[47:42] children have been given to you by the
[47:44] word of God that is what the Bible says
[47:46] so God knows that you never be happy
[47:49] rejoicing in the Holy Ghost when Prada
[47:52] is outside
[47:54] God knows that you never come to church
[47:56] rejoicing as long as your father is
[47:59] outside so this talking is for you your
[48:03] family
[48:04] this message is not looking for you
[48:06] alone Hallelujah but it's for your
[48:08] mother it's for your brother it's for
[48:11] your sister it's for your uncle
[48:13] Hallelujah so at Pentecost when the word
[48:16] was preached the Bible says they were
[48:19] pricked in their hearts not the children
[48:21] but the fathers they were prayed in
[48:24] their hearts they said what can we do to
[48:27] be saved he said repent and when you
[48:29] repent you shall be baptized in the name
[48:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ and you receive
[48:33] the Holy Ghost it's for you fathers and
[48:36] your children
[48:38] so tonight I want to tell you my brother
[48:40] my sister in the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:43] Christ by the authority of God's word I
[48:46] give you your house
[48:47] Allelujah apply the token upon your
[48:50] house
[48:51] apply the talking upon your mother apply
[48:54] the talking upon your children I apply
[48:57] the talking upon your grandchildren
[48:59] hallelujah oh holy spirit that dwells in
[49:03] me go after my sister go after my
[49:07] brother go after my children the same
[49:10] God who said a lamp for a house will
[49:13] bring your relatives in
[49:15] Hallelujah
[49:18] so the blood is the lamp Hallelujah the
[49:22] blood of the Lamb is a token and the
[49:24] token is the climax of any Ministry 18
[49:28] hour of judgment the token is displayed
[49:31] how can I be happy to be raptured
[49:34] without my wife
[49:35] how can I be happy to be raptured
[49:37] without my children and my brothers and
[49:38] my sisters but the token is good drawing
[49:42] power
[49:43] Hallelujah
[49:45] so in Genesis chapter number 22 where we
[49:47] read Isaac had a question he said where
[49:50] is the lamp
[49:52] so that question went on for Generations
[49:55] Moses gave them lamps to sacrifice but
[49:59] still that was never satisfactory
[50:01] Moses ordained the sacrificial lamb but
[50:06] still that was never satisfactory so
[50:08] after so many years John the Baptist
[50:11] sees the Lamb of God and points from the
[50:14] Lamb of Abraham's great great children
[50:17] so when Isaac asked the question
[50:20] he asked
[50:22] Abraham and Abraham answered and said
[50:26] the Lord himself
[50:29] Isaac says we are here on top of the
[50:31] mountain where is the sacrifice you know
[50:34] what the answer Father Abraham gave he
[50:36] said the Lord himself Hallelujah not a
[50:40] priest not Moses but the Lord himself
[50:44] shall become the lamb
[50:47] in other words the Lord himself will
[50:50] provide another office of himself
[50:52] to take care of the sins of the world
[50:55] Hallelujah you you provide himself you
[50:59] change his form or another office of
[51:02] himself to take away the sin of the
[51:04] world so when Jesus came the prophet
[51:07] eyes of the eagle John
[51:09] spotted Jesus
[51:11] and he says behold the token
[51:16] when John saw Jesus he said oh my this
[51:20] is the crowning of my Ministry
[51:23] I was sent to foreign is coming
[51:25] Hallelujah I told you that someone
[51:28] greater than me is coming
[51:30] Hallelujah when I spoke about him
[51:33] now he's here
[51:35] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[51:37] of the world then the church Angels came
[51:40] through and the lamp disappeared from
[51:43] the scene or from the physical sin
[51:46] and the lamp vanished from the physical
[51:48] scene so by the time of the opening of
[51:51] The Book of redemption
[51:53] he says who is worthy to open the book
[51:57] and no one was found worthy and then one
[51:59] of the elders said whip not John
[52:03] behold
[52:05] the lion of the tribe of Judah has
[52:09] prevailed he is worthy my God to take
[52:13] the book so John looked for the lion but
[52:16] he never saw the lion
[52:18] he saw the Lamb of God hallelujah and
[52:22] then John says okay he's got to be a
[52:25] lamp before he rose like a lion
[52:28] my God my God who of us here ever
[52:32] thought that before you roll like a lion
[52:33] you have to become the lamb first then
[52:36] after a while
[52:38] Hallelujah
[52:39] God will come and help you to be matured
[52:43] like what the pastor was saying
[52:45] hallelujah
[52:47] so the lamb came and took the book and
[52:49] reviewed the seals so in the book of
[52:52] Exodus the lamb was given the blood
[52:54] thereof for a token so when Isaac
[52:57] brought his question
[52:59] Abraham's answer was manifested on the
[53:03] River Jordan
[53:05] am I communicating
[53:06] John answered Isaac's question
[53:10] now at the time of the opening of The
[53:13] Seven Seals which is in this day the
[53:16] book of redemption is revealed Again by
[53:20] the lamp
[53:22] therefore I can say the identification
[53:25] of the lamp in this end type is the
[53:29] climax of The End Time message
[53:33] it cannot go beyond the identification
[53:36] of Christ
[53:37] Hallelujah this message cannot Advance
[53:41] beyond the opening of the seals you can
[53:44] say what about the rapturement of God
[53:46] that's what the seals is all about
[53:49] there's no other Rapture that you're
[53:50] ever going to besides what was spoken in
[53:54] the opening of the seals we are not
[53:56] waiting for the manifestation of the
[53:58] rapture
[53:59] the Rapture is not a one-day event the
[54:02] Rapture is a process
[54:04] you are raptured before you are raptured
[54:06] Enoch was ruptured before he was
[54:09] raptured he was walking with God he was
[54:12] walking with God and one day he got into
[54:14] another higher Dimension I'm no longer
[54:17] operating from Texas I'm no longer
[54:19] operating from America I'm now operating
[54:21] from that third pool Realm
[54:24] Allelujah I'm in the word and the word
[54:27] is in me I'm in the third pool and the
[54:30] third pool is in me I'm in the Rapture
[54:33] and the Rapture is in me brother I'm in
[54:36] the spoken word and the spoken word is
[54:38] in me you already raptured that's why
[54:41] you are saying amen because there is
[54:44] something in you when you hear about New
[54:46] Jerusalem oh I hear my theophany calling
[54:49] Hallelujah
[54:51] brother before you are changed you start
[54:54] rejoicing because there is a substance
[54:57] of what you are hoping for give God a
[55:00] shot of praise
[55:02] you already raptured
[55:04] but the Rapture is not going to you're
[55:07] not just going to walk in the streets of
[55:09] Bedford and the Rapture will just happen
[55:11] no no no no no no no no no
[55:13] we are told that it's going to be a
[55:16] secret
[55:18] are you the Bride of Jesus Christ
[55:21] hallelujah it's not something that we
[55:23] are my God let me tell you something
[55:25] this is coming fresh now now listen
[55:29] listen to this
[55:33] the Bible says behold I come as a thief
[55:36] at night
[55:38] are we together
[55:40] so in if a thief comes at my house at
[55:43] 3am he has already come
[55:46] when he gets by the gate he has already
[55:49] come when he enters into the house and
[55:52] sees an iPhone he has already come when
[55:55] he takes the phone and puts in the
[55:57] pocket and go he has already come
[56:00] are we together are we together so when
[56:03] you wake up in the morning and you find
[56:06] the phone is not there the thief has
[56:08] already come in 1963 the thief came and
[56:13] he was doing what he was doing he was
[56:15] doing what he was doing he was changing
[56:17] me brother he was changing me Hallelujah
[56:21] so the thief has already come
[56:25] Allelujah
[56:28] oh
[56:30] you no longer smoke
[56:32] you no longer do this you no longer take
[56:34] drugs
[56:36] you no longer drink
[56:38] Hallelujah
[56:40] if you confess your sins and make your
[56:43] life right God does not remember
[56:46] you can come to God and keep on
[56:49] confessing the same sins brother you are
[56:51] wasting your precious time God does not
[56:53] even remember that you ever did it what
[56:57] is under the blood is under the blood
[57:00] Hallelujah God does not remember
[57:03] brother Branham under the gift of
[57:06] discernment if you come in the line when
[57:09] he's descending after you've confessed
[57:11] since God was not showing him the
[57:13] confessed sins
[57:16] are we together
[57:18] because what is under the blood is under
[57:21] the blood that's how powerful it is
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:26] in that blood is our Supreme token
[57:30] you are Justified
[57:32] you are cleared your case has been
[57:35] dismissed if you accept Jesus tonight is
[57:38] your personal Lord and Savior if you
[57:41] confess your sins and make your life
[57:43] right you are clean and you are wise By
[57:46] the Waters of the word
[57:48] God does not remember
[57:50] who is Worthy
[57:52] and nobody was found worthy
[57:54] Hallelujah isn't it strange brothers and
[57:57] sisters that the lamp took our place
[58:01] an innocent limp
[58:04] the Bible did not even say a sheep
[58:07] the lamp is the young one of a sheep
[58:09] that's what took our place
[58:12] Hallelujah
[58:13] the Bible says at that day
[58:16] you shall know
[58:18] that I am in the father
[58:21] and the father is in me brother if I had
[58:24] a board here I was going to draw a big
[58:26] circle
[58:28] and I'll write God on it
[58:31] inside that Circle I draw a circle then
[58:34] I'll write Christ on it
[58:36] inside that smaller say I drew another
[58:38] smaller Circle in the right brother
[58:40] calebunion
[58:42] so before the devil touches you he has
[58:46] to go through God get to Christ before
[58:49] he touches you in other words he has got
[58:51] to be justified and he's going to be
[58:53] Sanctified and he's going to receive the
[58:55] Holy Ghost when he receive the Holy
[58:57] Ghost he's already your brother
[59:00] Hallelujah so the devil cannot touch you

[59:16] surrounded by the Lord Jesus Christ and
[59:19] by the almighty God so brother sister

[59:28] is waiting on you so no devil can get a
[59:31] hold of you you are predestinated in
[59:34] your destination is predetermined

[59:40] supposed to go to heaven

[59:47] be raptured
[59:50] because you are meant to overcome
[59:53] adultery you will be changed because you
[59:57] are meant to be changed brother there is
[1:00:00] something in you Hallelujah that when

[1:00:25] world

[1:00:30] so the devil cannot touch you
[1:00:32] Hallelujah if was not destroyed I will
[1:00:36] be raptured
[1:00:39] because I saw my name in the book in the
[1:00:42] last book of life
[1:00:43] when John saw his name nobody could tell
[1:00:46] him shut up John
[1:00:48] he says everything in heaven
[1:00:51] the sharks in the sea the walls in the
[1:00:54] sea they had me saying hallelujah

[1:01:21] you
[1:01:22] Hallelujah
[1:01:23] today I want to look at the Devil with
[1:01:26] the fierceness of faith on my face I
[1:01:28] don't say by faith I shall be healed
[1:01:31] that's not the caliber of the Believers
[1:01:33] Hallelujah faith is not a little timid
[1:01:37] hope
[1:01:38] say God I shall be by faith I shall be
[1:01:41] healed

[1:02:10] existence but I've got eternity years

[1:02:26] mind of God before covid-19 came I was
[1:02:30] in the mind of God hallelujah when

[1:02:36] I was there when Abraham fought with
[1:02:39] chadeloma and prevailed I was there how
[1:02:42] can I worry about the 2022 demon when I
[1:02:45] defeated the devil before he was the
[1:02:47] devil
