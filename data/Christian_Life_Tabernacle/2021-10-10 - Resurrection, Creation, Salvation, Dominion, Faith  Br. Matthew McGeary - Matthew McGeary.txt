tonight not as a story that was 2 000 years ago but lord that you died for me and you died for your elect that stands here tonight may these songs not become just ritual and tradition but may there be a life and a testimony that we identify with the words that when we would sing it lord we would worship you in spirit and in truth to know that you are alive that you're living among your people you are our savior you are our redeemer you're our lord you're everything that we've ever had need of and that's why we give you the praise the honor that you so richly deserve lord we all just right now want to lay ourselves at your feet lord pray that you forgive us lord for our shortcomings our failures our iniquities our sin we plead that precious blood that we would stand before you as you're redeemed washed justified that we've never done it in the first place that we can just enter in into such an expectation an atmosphere this evening to know lord that the works that you have performed lord were sufficient that we stand before you lord with no sin and no fault no failure not because of what we've done lord but because of what you've done and you've called us in such a day and age lord at the very climactic time to the catching away of your bride that you would fulfill all things lord through the church ages in your bride as death would be swallowed up in victory lord we're looking for that great millennial day may this just be one step closer lord may we not take this evening for granted but may we know that you predestinated it that you would come by our way and speak to us we pray that you break the bread of life lord as only you can we surrender ourselves now to you that you would have your perfect will and way in this service we ask it and pray now in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord amen if you have your bibles we'll just try to read a few scriptures we'll um maybe just for a text we'll read out of genesis chapter one and man just remember our pastor in prayer um uh we we got the call just before service um i just before five o'clock that he wasn't feeling well he was planning on taking the service and so we're uh just by god's grace gonna fill in and um worship the lord and just look for what the lord would have and just pray that maybe in a a reading of a few scriptures and quotes that we'd be blessed amen so we're just trusting in the lord amen while you're just turning there if you also want to mark another portion of scripture we'll be reading out of john chapter 14. but we just want to bring you greetings from um brother gabriel um in romania and arad romania um he is a brother that we've we've come to know and appreciate greatly me and brother cosman had the the opportunity to go minister at uh several churches in romania and so we bring um greetings from brother gabriel and brother florine and just other pastors uh throughout the romania area i believe we're at seven different churches and just it was such a privilege and an honor to meet the bride of jesus christ uh over there in romania just to think of what this word has produced it's produced the cream of the crowd and you know you go into some of these other countries and you go down into certain areas where it's poverty and you know that that country was stricken by uh communism and it's just uh you go in there and then you see the saints of god all gathered together and and just in into the yard of someone's house there wasn't enough room in the house so they just all gathered out in the yard and and come together praising god and it's the same spirit the same word the same god and it's just humbling to be a part of that and so uh we just bring you greetings from all of them and and uh we're just thankful we had an opportunity to be sent by the local assembly here so uh me and brother cosman are looking uh uh to bring a report of our our trip and so we'll be working on that that we can bring you up to date amen praise the lord so just reading out of genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and also let's read out of john chapter 14. verse 12. it says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it amen lord jesus we just ask a blessing upon the reading of your word in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may have be seated man we'll just um just look how the lord might lead in this service just to maybe start out i love the message brother branham preaches look away to jesus in december 29 1963 and brother branham would start out in that service and he would start to talk about his ministry and about how the pillar of fire appeared down there on the ohio river in 1933 about two o'clock in the afternoon and you'll you'll notice that even when brother branham is preaching christ the mystery of god revealed about almost uh to the day 30 years later brother branham would say after preaching christ the mystery of god revealed i believe was july 28 1963 he would say if if you'll turn around me not knowing it but if you turn around and look at the clock it's two o'clock on the dot it's the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand and brother brandon would start to go through this this uh look away to jesus and he'd start to talk about the beginning of his ministry and he would start to talk about the first pool and the second pool and he would make this statement and he would say on in the the 60-second paragraph here and look away to jesus he'd say and now the third thing has taken place see constantly moving on and so now he's identifying that the third pull has now been come into manifestation and i just liked how he said this he said constantly moving on because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is the i am he is the god of history but he is the god of right now so god is actually doing something right now we know the third pool was revealing christ and so christ has been revealed and christ is among us but christ the word is actually doing something in a people he's accomplishing something right now and i like how the prophet identifies it he says just constantly moving on so we want to be moving with the word we we we recognize what god has done and we know what god is going to do but then we want to recognize it's very important as believers we don't get trapped into the ways of man where we're always looking into the past we're always looking toward into the future and yet god has given us such a great word and a great manifestation of the scriptures in the end time and we rejoice in those things but in our rejoicing we don't want to lose sight of what that word and that life of jesus christ is actually doing in the bride right now and so just if i could say just as uh as marvelous as those things were that we can identify and rejoice that the pillar of fire appeared down on the ohio river in 1933 and that we could look at how the prophet would identify that the third pool has now been manifest manifest and we look back and we rejoice in those things that have been manifested if you would say in a way of history but jesus christ he is the i am it's a present word so that was just the word being manifested that was just the word taken on flesh and so jesus christ is still living he's still alive he's still amongst us that the word is still moving and now it's moving in a people it's constantly moving on his word is is constantly unfolding and so we want to be careful and have that revelation that we're continuing to move with the word not just looking back not just looking forward but to understand that god has actually gathered a people together that's what the third poll was it was a shout it was the bread of life going forth gathering the bride of jesus christ together where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered oh we've we've recognized the word in the last day that has been revealed and it's caught our attention and it's gathered us together to christ the word but now christ the word is wanting to take on flesh he's wanting to take on your skin as we look into the scriptures and we see the word manifested in moses we see the word manifested in david we see that the prophet isaiah would prophesy and say a virgin shall conceive and we'd see mary would play out her part and certain uh the patriarchs would play out their part until the fullness of the word would come and be made flesh and then he would be waved over their people on calvary the sheaf wave and then he'd be waved back to them on the day of pentecost and they would fulfill the prophecy of joel 2 28 that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and there they come out of the upper room and they're saying this is that what was it it was the word that had been prophesied that same pillar of fire the same word now was moving on in a people that same word that jesus christ was the manifestation of now he had ascended to heaven but he said i will not leave you comfortless but i will send the comfort unto you so now that logos that same pillar of fire that was resident there and our savior jesus christ had now changed god and morphe into another dispensation and now god and murphy had changed into a dispensation of the son of god through the church ages and now he's living out in his people the bride and so we always want to recognize as the word continues to unfold and we want to see that word unfolding in our life that's what i want i want to see this message i want to see this word i want to see it unfolding in me i want this word to become a reality i don't want to just be believing something historically and believing for something in the future but the word actually has fruits and it actually has a manifestation and it actually has a life and that's what the word was given for because god had placed a seed inside of you a word seed and so he sent his word light that would strike the word seed that would bring forth all of the potentials that god had placed in that seed that was the purpose of this message in malachi 4 5 that god in his mind would predestinate a people and he'd place you here in ladies here knowing that we'd be living in satan's eden it would be the wickedest of all ages and god would know that in this great wickedness the darkness of all ages i am going to reserve a people for me just like the prophet would come to jesus and said oh only i have escaped and god said what are you talking about i have seven thousand that i've reserved that not have been the need to bill i want to say god has reserved a bride in the end time that one that bowed to the god of this hero age that will not bow to the things of satan's eden but we have we have been reserved we have been preserved we have been predestinated to stand in the evil day oh hallelujah thank god that his mind was towards you because if it wasn't for god's word if it wasn't for his thoughts toward you oh these are my thoughts that i think towards you not thoughts of evil but thoughts of peace to bring you into an expected end oh saints don't you know that god has something expected of you he expects for you to make it he expects for you to overcome he expects for death to be swallowed up in victory he expects for you to put your head on the enemy why because you are the very word that he's been predestinated to be here it's him in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's a revelation that we want to come into understanding in a greater way to know that god is in you you're not the one that's willing it's god in you that is willing to fulfill the word oh praise god that we are in his mind from the very beginning that god had these thoughts for you so we want to play out our part we we see all the saints of all they they played out their part and mary and and the patriarchs and and paul and all them but then it comes down to our day what does the prophet say we're writing another book of acts we can look in the bible the infallible word and we could read names in there we could read about the apostles we could read about paul we could read about david and abraham and we reverenced that because it's written in the scripture oh but i want to say unto you your name was written in the lamb's book of life before the world was ever formed you also have a part in the word of god your name was written oh hallelujah it's in this day that the very names that were written in the lamb's book of life you got to recognize your part in the word that's what the opening of the seals was doing it was revealing to you who you are it was revealing christ but it was revealing the bride it was calling your name that's why the prophet of god could say you've heard from your theophany you've heard from your theophany why because we're part of that word our names are written in the word so maybe as we just try to move a little further just the prophet is identifying now that the third thing has has been properly identified it's been manifested but it's constantly moving i want to move with it it's constantly moving i want to move with the pillar of fire i want to move with the message i want to move with the leading of the lord whether the bride of jesus christ isn't just sitting back and waiting and saying we've done our part we've heard the word now we're just going to sit here and wait but no the word is living in an action in a people the word is living in an action in a people well come on let's aim in the word tonight i i might be boring you but the things that i'm saying is the word of god we either believe it or we don't why don't we just do a little second boy say amen i know i know we're familiar with these things but that's all right i want to say jesus christ save you i can't help it i got saved by jesus christ so every time i hear something in me rejoices i just can't help it that story never gets told you want to say god's a healer i say amen you want to say he's a deliverer i say amen there's something inside of me that can't help to respond to the word because if you've ever been there hallelujah have you ever been there where you were down and out and you had no hope and you tried within yourself to be delivered and you're bound by all these things but then jesus christ came and he set you free oh i love to hear other people's testimony i love to hear the word of god because it identifies with me something inside of me just says yea and amen so look if you've heard it before just get behind it just a minute because somebody else here might not have heard it before somebody else might just be hearing their name for the first time we ought to rejoice in these things it's only two or three times out of the week amen this is what i live for i live for the word of god oh there's nothing else i lift for the things of the world i was out there in the things of the world i was out there in sin i was out there in unbelief and i come to find out there was nothing out there in the world that could ever feel that deep inside of me there was a deep calling to a deep and there was nothing in the world that could respond to that deep i could do as much drugs as i wanted to drink enough alcohol i could sell it i could do it i could run this way and that way i could make money but nothing would even touch that void for the scripture says sin is pleasurable for a season oh my but you find yourself just used and abused down and out with no life in you but there's something inside of you that's calling out for a god something inside you that's calling out for a savior and if you'll just humble yourself and call on god oh the scripture says if you call on the name of the lord you shall be saved and i tell you when you experience the tender loving hand of almighty god to reach down into your situation and to lift you up out of the muck and the mirror you said you want to know why we're rejoicing you want to know why we're shouting why because we've experienced the saving grace of almighty god that's transformed alive that's quickened you from dead unbelief to a living resurrected savior with a life on the inside of you that's being victorious oh hallelujah you're more than a match for the world this ain't a dead letter church this is a living resurrected savior that's living in a bride with the same power that he had when he walked the the shores of galilee the same word the same life living in the people we have something to rejoice about we have something to shout about and i'm thankful for it but as maybe what's on my heart i'm trying to move maybe in a direction for seeing the unfolding of the word into our lives and into our day and the prophet of god would say this in paragraph 84. he would say how many remembers about the squirrels all right listen to the words of the prophet here he said that was a puzzling scripture in my life i never could understand that it would just go on we'll see what he's referring to he says and there was another one that puzzled me that was when moses could tell god a better way than god knowed how to do anything when moses said the people will say your god was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and moses threw himself into the breach then later i found out that moses that was christ in moses standing for the people you know i marvel that i i love the prophet how humble he was later i found out i feel like many times bribe members can't find out anything oh we do we just know it all somebody comes and shares a quote that became real to me oh yeah yeah uh-huh yeah that one where he said this you know he also says it over there yeah uh-huh yeah i got that i'm like a google search query anything you can say i can do better you know it's like we can't humble ourselves you know i love that quote that's so awesome that's wonderful tell me more but here the prophet is saying he's like look later i found out see why because the word it's not that he didn't know the word not that he had not seen the manifestation of the word but there's a greater unfolding now something that's coming into manifestation or a revelation that's breaking to the prophet and he says later i found out that was moses that was christ and moses standing for the people see so then on this scripture now watch this watch what the prophet says he says that i i never would preach on it if you say to this mountain be moved and you know the story so i'll bypass that now little did i know what that was leading to so now the prophet is identifying scriptures just like even one we said right we read in john 14 says verily 14 verse 12 says verily i say in you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also greater works than these shall he do because i go unto the father now the prophet is going to pick up this scripture and he will preach on the scripture and give an understanding of it but then later in the message this this this letter this word that's lame in the scripture is actually gonna come into greater revelation and greater unfolding because now it's time it's the time and season that the revelation or the the further unfolding of this scripture is made or revealed to the bride because it would always be like well it's more it's you know it's a greater you know greater how could you do greater and he would explain show that well that's more because now it's in the bride it's more but he actually would come later now and actually provide a further revelation of what this word manifested in a people after the opening of the word now you say brother brother matthew what do you mean after the opening of the word well hold on here yes i know the third pull was in manifestation before the breaking and opening of the seals but the third pull before 1963 was a mystery you see so now god being a prepared god prepared a vessel named william branham and now god would come and veil himself in that form god and morphing now taking on flesh in a man but yet he was veiled oh hallelujah he was veiled there in that first pool he was veiled there in that second pool but then he's gonna come on down as this third pull starts breaking and he'll preach the unveiling of god in 1964 and he says i intend to unveil that god to you why because the god that was there all the time come on somebody the god that was there all the time but he was veiled is now going to unveil himself to a people but the unveiling is for a purpose that he might unveil himself to the bride of jesus christ and there would be a union there would be a united that now that word that was being unveiled would come into a unity into a people and now that third pool revelation would take on flesh in the bride oh glory to god i'm so glad that i'm a part of that oh my just look at this and how it continues he continues to to speak here i just need god's help we had no preparation here so we'll just see how god would speak to us tonight but we know that the son of man ministry is the word taking on flesh amen it's the word becoming flesh that's what the son of man ministry is and so the prophet of god he starts to go through and speak about uh the third pull manifestation you know he'd speak about the first time i believe it was little fishy i give you your life back right so you see now that the first time that we see the the third pull it actually brings forth resurrection and the second time he starts to talk about the squirrels and the second time the third pool was in manifestation what was it it was creation so then now we see what we see what actually the third pool is doing and i want to move towards a portion here and look away to jesus where the prophet of god is actually going to say i think it's paragraph 181 along them lines he would say now there's no more doubt in my mind i now know what the third pull is and what it does and something in my heart i pray is if god would bring the prophet the uh if i could say it this way a shape wave one that was a first one to maturity that he could come to the revelation where he could stand there before the people and say now there's no more doubt in my mind why would the prophet say that because there was something in him there was a pondering there was a wandering not an unbelief but there was this something inside of him a wanting to understand or grasp and that while he'd even be preaching the sixth seal i believe it was and souls that are in prison he would be saying is it too late i mean the third pool of jesus's ministry was preaching uh to souls that are in prison and we're now we're now entering into the third pool and he had this question he say is it too late it might be he's like i hope not because i have family out there so there was this unfolding as the word was breaking forth and he would come into preaching uh uh souls that are in prison and he would move on down and then now as he's preaching this look away to jesus and oh my in that morning service he had preached there is a man here that could turn on the light oh you couple those two uh services together my oh what a rejoicing what a rejoicing that there was a man that come in our day that could turn on the light oh without that light without the manifestation of that why we're all lost we're all doomed there's no way to believe because there's no light to shine upon the seed and quicken you oh my just like it was in the very beginning when god created the heavens and the earth what did he do he said let there be let there be and he put seed there in the earth but they're in that darkness they're in that void they're in that confusion that seed lay dormant it laid there dead until god said let there be light and that's exactly what happened in our day god said let there be light and in the midst of all the darkness and lady will seal god brought his word that was laying dormant in scripture and he called a man on the seed and he came and veiled himself in that man and he broke the seventh seal mystery which was the light which was jesus christ shining upon that predestinated seed and quickening you to life oh without that word thank god for the revelation of the son of man because that was the light that had to shine in the end time let there be light oh thank god for his word thank god for his revelation thank god for the message because without this message i am dead oh my but thank god oh thank god he didn't leave me down there in the age of horse and buggy thank god he didn't leave me down there in the age of man thank god he didn't leave me there in a little airplane bumping around with little nip downs and touchdowns but he said oh now we have actually come into the age of astronauts we have risen down from the earthly we have planned going into the heavenly and we're actually soaring right by mars going goodbye mars i'm going to be with my lord i'm going to be with my savior for eternity oh what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is to be quick and from undead belief in his word and to be made alive in jesus christ i'm thankful for the message hallelujah praise god praise his wonderful name oh my so just the prophet would go on and say the third time it happened was hattie wright so the first time brought resurrection second time brought creation third time he says the third time the third pool ever came in a manifestation on mortal man and what did it produce it produced salvation so now we're starting to catch hallelujah we're actually starting to catch the manifestations of the third pull because the prophet later on is going to say i now know what the third pull is and i know what it does and now we can look into the message of the prophet now is taking the time to walk us through the manifestations of the third pool in his life and we're actually seeing resurrection we're seeing creation we're actually seeing salvation now i want you to think about this for a second the prophet of god is now sharing a manifestation of the third pool and hattie wright says the right thing she says that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing to the word now i want to bring out something about the power of the third pool and now for you to start actually taking advantage of the benefits and the effect that in the age that we're living with in where the book has become a new book because actually watch the work oh hallelujah this is powerful now watch the work or the manifestation that the third paul had when she said the right thing of the word the lord spoke to brother brandon the prophet and said give her what she asked for now she under the third pool revelation was actually able to speak salvation for her family oh if that don't make a mommy or a daddy start to shout if that don't make you want to start rejoicing to know that what god has done in loosing the seven seals and actually sent you his very own zoning life doing tabernacle himself in a believer and under the revelation of that third pull and the effects it can have on your life that you can actually stand there and speak salvation for your family no i have not lost my mind i believe the message and i can see the revelation of those seven seals and the opening of the word of the effect that it had on an individual and believed that if it had that same effect oh come on now he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he did it that way one time he'll do it that way again that if you say the right thing to this word and say that's nothing but the truth there is a power there is a manifestation that has been bestowed upon the pride of jesus christ that you are the final voice you are the final voice to the final age it's going to be through your lips that you speak the word now we're moving into a maturity we're moving towards a step in the scripture of further unfolding the prophet is showing the further unfolding or manifestation of these scriptures in our day taking it off the pages now the third time it happened was hattie wright is had he right here tonight how many knows had it right brother woods and i were sitting there when it happened and when the holy spirit said give her what she wants now friends if you miss it if you miss what's actually happening right now is written word written word lame in the scripture actually becoming flesh we're actually seeing the word made flesh yeah it's written a different way it has a different accent trust me the way you were this in english wasn't the way it was written and i had a different accent but praise god it had the same life and the same yes manifestations so now watch this unfolding give her what she wants now what does my bible say amen all right so now we're actually seeing the word being made flesh not something we look back in the past and just say i believe it but now i want this word to be made flesh in my life whatsoever things that you ask we're actually seeing now the word made flesh in a prophet bring the written word into a reality for a believer who said amen to the word oh hallelujah what did we hear our pastor preached this morning it's all about faith and faith is a gift look you couldn't even believe if god didn't give you the gift of faith and god doesn't give bad gifts oh hallelujah he gave you the gift of faith that can believe every single word of god oh my if you can believe it you can have it oh what shall we say to these if you can believe it why start thinking big i'm reminded of the scripture in the bible when the prophet told him strike the ground with the arrows and he said all right well praise god i strike the ground i think you struck the ground three times the prophet said what are you doing why did you only strike the ground three times he said because you only struck the ground three times then you're gonna have to keep putting up with your enemy oh bride don't just strike the ground three times just start striking the ground just start speaking the word start claiming your family claim your neighbors claim your co-workers i don't care start striking the ground start speaking start believing start doing something because that's why god placed you here he placed you here to take the word and make it live watch this unfolding here give her what she wants well just go ahead and put yourself there quit selling yourself short the whole bible was written for you jesus christ went to calvary for you god sent a prophet for you god built a church in bedford texas for you god had a sunday night service on october 10th for you now when we start putting ourself in the word you talk about demons not knowing what to do with you when you actually what did what did that's exactly what jesus christ did the prophet of god said that jesus actually hung everything on the words of a backslidden prophet that david said i will not suffer my holy one to see corruption the prophet of god said he hung all of that on that one prophecy that he knew that if he went down in the grave because god had spoke that through a prophet that he would not leave as well leave his word void but that he would actually manifest that so now what are we doing we place ourself in the word we're living by the word we're walking in the word because what the word is constantly moving the opening of the word the third pull manifestation revelation is continually unfolding in your life don't sell god short don't sell yourself short don't sell the word short god got big plans for your life i mean you're the very a culmination hallelujah you're the bride that god foresaw in the end time that he would want to use your vessel to bring forth the same death is swallowed up in victory that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye i shall be changed or to think that god placed me here in the end time that i could be living in the age of the rapture god has called you out of a lady you see a condition he's called you into a pride age he's called you into a rapture age now the prophet said we can't beat our type and who is our type our type is enoch well get to walking bride just get to walking just get to walking in the way one day one day one by one just keep on walking and one of these days oh my you're gonna be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you're going to be gone why because that's the word that was spoken concerning the pride in the end time so much so you can't miss it he said you are predestinated not to miss it you can't fail you are predestinated not to fail so let's get our eyes off of the worry let's get our eyes off the unbelief and start walking in the revealed word of the hour with an expectation of the third pull manifestation in our life that's what you're putting here for you want to know what hattie wright was put on the earth to manifest the word right now watch this he says and brother woods and i was sitting there when it happened and the wooden hole the holy spirit said give her what she wants oh hallelujah like i said put yourself there now god's talking to somebody give her what she wants you've been praying for something the word is still sharper than any touch of sword it's still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart god is still speaking he's speaking to the bride give her what she wants oh no no no more unbelief those things are dead to the believer there's only one thing and that's his word and his word alone and here the bible is saying i'm just i'm just reading the bible another way give her what you okay if that's too hard for let's let i'm sorry you can't receive it from a vindicated prophet i'm sorry let's go back to the letter because the manifestation of the word in our day people are blind to it just like when the word was made flesh in front of the sadducees and pharisees they couldn't see the words standing in front of them so what does god do in the seventh church age by divine promise he says behold i send you elijah he says as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of man and what do we have revelations 10 1-7 manifested in this day and age standing in front of the people discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart showing the messiah sign but yet they couldn't recognize the word that was being made flesh standing before him because they were not elected to see that word but when the elected soul that word made flesh something inside of them said the right thing just like hattie wright they said that's nothing but the truth i can't understand it so because god has placed that predestinated sight on the inside of you and you have responded to the word and said i believe it that's nothing but the truth the word is saying back to you give her what she wants oh hallelujah i'm reminded of the scripture when esther mordecai came to esther and said esther maybe it was for such a time as this that you have come to the kingdom maybe it was such a time as this that you have been predestinated and elected to live in the darkest age that has ever struck the face of earth maybe it's at such a time as this that you are here and now what did esther do she actually barged into the king's court and came up to the king it was death to go in there but she was elected she was chosen just like the priest that would go behind the veil they were elected they were chosen they were dressed right they were anointed to go into the presence of god oh hallelujah you have been anointed to be in the presence of the shekinah lord you are anointed to go into his presence that you can go behind the veil into the shot kind of glory and you can come up to the king and he'll put out a scepter and you say whatever you ask to the half of the kingdom now the revelation of that is not that the king was going to give her half of the kingdom but you say whatever you want we'll rule it together whatever you ask for it it ain't going to just be you and your request but it's going to be me and you doing it together give her what she asked i'll perform the word that you ask of me oh my what an inheritance church something that we have received an open book jesus christ descending jesus christ coming down making himself known to his bride a love religious relationship a love affair whispering secrets into our ears the church world can't understand it the church world can't accept it oh but to you you're the most blessed people that has ever walked the face of the earth to be living in the time of this revelation oh hallelujah oh if i could just get out of this paragraph when it happened hallelujah oh friends oh this what this word is alive it's a living word it's not a dead letter it's the very life of god living in a people that if you could just take one scripture and let it become a reality in your life oh heavens and earth will pass away but god's word will never pass away give her what she wants and we was talking about that how them squirrels come into existence and i said is the only thing it is he is jehovah jireh just now watch this this is beautiful just when abraham needed a ram god provided that ram he provided the squirrels he can speak a squirrel just into existence because he is creator just the same as he could speak the ram watch this now abraham never asked for it he was just simply going on to do it now catch that if we're obedient to god's word if you're just being obedient to god's word and you're walking in the revelation that he's given to you when you come to a place where you have a need he said he was just simply going on to do it but it showed that jehovah jireh was there now what that speaks to me is if you will just walk in the word and be obedient to that word that means you're walking with jehovah jireh abraham was walking with jehovah jireh the god that gave him the promise look he had received a son from the dead so he knew the same god that gave him that son was able to raise that son up again look the same god that quickened you from undead belief the same god that called you elected you predestinated you that filled you with the holy ghost if he could rescue you from the pits of hell if he could rescue you from sin if he could deliver you from bondage then what need do you have tonight what is it that you have need of you are walking with jehovah jireh you are walking with jehovah jireh if you'll just be obedient if you'll just be faithful keep walking with the word and if you have need of something jehovah jireh is there to speak that need into existence give her what she wants oh hallelujah well i said that a humble little woman for the first time this ever happened the third pull upon a human being was a little humble woman now maybe we should just stop a moment here the third time the third pull ever came into manifestation on a mortal being it came into manifestation on a little puffed up prideful church that thinks they're the bomb and they can't fail or make it and they are just it and nobody else can measure up to them and we are just it we're going in a body change look at me i recognize malachi 4 5. do you see my nice suit do you see my nice house look at all the good that god has done for me oh we get results we scream and shout we got them out pentecostals [Music] bigger churches more well let's just preach the word i ain't saying nothing the prophet didn't say and god god has blessed us god has blessed us with nice homes and nice cars god has blessed us with a nice church but we're not we're not talking about the blessings we're talking about the attitude behind the blessings we're talking about the self-vindication that comes over people and they think oh look at all the things i got we get results don't we no that's not our vindication our vindication is the word and that god put a faith seed on inside of us that when we heard the word we believe the word and the evidence of the holy ghost in your life is that you say amen to the word now we can preach on that for a little while we could preach about that in the works in your life and how you dress and how you act and all those things anyway we could really start getting cutting a little bit but we'll just keep moving on upon a human being was a little humble woman a little humble woman i say there needs to be some humility in the church so now the prophet of god is walking well praise god i don't know if i should quit preaching or quit keep going i don't even know if i've said anything yet the third the third the third pull up on a human being was a little humble woman just making about 200 a year for her living all she got out of that little farm her husband dead two children had turned kind of wild and come and donate 20 of that to the building of this tabernacle amita had given me some money that morning for groceries 20 and i was going to give it back to her that day and when i was down there so that she wouldn't have to pay it but she wouldn't take it go get god his first church maybe you wonder why things are hard and you're you're not making ends meet try god it's one of the things in the scripture he says try me give god his first there's a story about a widow woman in the bible she was going to make a cake and die but the prophet came and said as the lord live it give me a cake first and then the curse of oil will never run dry and you know what she did she said okay i'm going to give to you first and god blessed her for that there's blessings in honoring the word of god yes sir she was just sitting back in the corner when i said only thing i know is he is still jehovah gyra and little hattie wright said the right word she said that's nothing but the truth and when she said that brother banks woods here was the one that was present the room felt like it was coming apart and the holy spirit said the same voice that spoke about them squirrel said give her what she asked for now is that not the same identification in the word that said verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hallelujah he that believeth on me the works that i shall do he shall do also and greater works than me shall you do because i go unto the father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it i love how the prophet goes on to tell the story he goes on to say well she's like what should i ask for see she didn't even know what she was going to ask for just like that widow woman who thought she was going to bake two cakes and die didn't know that god had already spoke to a prophet and said i have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee god had committed or commanded a widow woman just to sustain the prophet and she didn't even know it just how god sent elijah to preach to preach the message and little did you know that god had predestinated a bride to sustain the message and actually make it live when the prophet had gone off the scene you were predestinated to receive the message you were predestinated to receive it and make this word live hallelujah heidi wright didn't even know what she was going to ask for but guess who did god knew her heart god knew what she would ask for why who was it in hattie wright it was that predestinated seed it was god in hattie right that said amen to the word and it's god in you that is saying amen to the word and when you wonder in your heart what you should ask for when you really get alone and get into his presence and he comes down and you really start to have fellowship oh you start to speak things like our lord and say not my will lord but vine will be done and you find yourself in a presence in an estate that where all things are possible and as the holy ghost would move upon your heart you can ask for the things that are according to his word and you shall have what you ask for because it's god in you asking for his very word oh hallelujah praise god now we're seeing the scriptures that are written now coming to life and the prophet of god would go on to tell how she spoke the word and there those two kids that were snickering and acting up pitched themselves over and they gave gave their heart to the lord what was it it was the third manifestation of the third pull bringing forth resurrection bringing forth creation now bringing forth salvation and as we continue to move forward i don't know exactly maybe where our target is but we just maybe keep moving here so now we keep going on and we know that fourth manifestation i believe was when he spoke to the storm so now the fourth manifestation of the third pool what is it we're seeing dominion now we're saying all these things to show what the opening of the word is to produce in the believer's life i want to move a little further because the scripture says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word but then the prophet then would pick up john 5 24 and say he that heareth my words and he would actually identify that word and say it's not necessarily hearing but he who understands my word so then there has to be a revelation that comes with the word that you're hearing it's not enough just to say amen to the word and not have no fruits in your life but if it's a true seed that's saying amen to the word it is quickened and it now starts to bear the fruits of the word so he that heareth my word he that understandeth my word he who catches the revelation that is being revealed to the elected seed of this day and age is he who hears my word my sheep hear my voice and another one they will not follow so now as the word is breaking forth to the believer and the word is constantly moving in your life it's now starting to bring forth the manifestation and the fruits of the word and we see what that third pool is actually producing in the believer's life it's producing resurrection [Music] it gives power of creation it brings salvation restoring dominion back into the hands of man again all that adam had lost oh hallelujah the lamb has now descended with the open book for redemption claims not to keep the book to himself but to give the book back what did he do he gave it to the seventh angel but that wasn't the last place it was supposed to stay but he told john go take the book now you can't beat your type bride john's apart john the type of the bride so we've recognized the open book in the hand of the seventh angel but have you gone and taken the book you believe that's a step in the right direction you have recognized the revelation and the opening of the word but now what he's wanting to do he's telling you take the book eat it up thou must prophesy again now we're seeing the third pull in manifestation in the bride oh hallelujah let it be and there was speaking squirrels into existence a first one coming to maturity showing what all of the wheat seed in the field that were going to come into that same maturity now i'm just foolish enough to believe it i believe god has called me ordained me to receive that open book to eat it up to prophesy again and to see the third pull with the same manifestations in my life but like our prophet said i don't have to work it up i don't have to try to manifest it i don't have to try to look at that little chandelier you know you read the you you read the story about the prophet he tells what was her name uh she says you believe he goes all right move that little chandelier little uh cord hanging back and forth jordy carter yeah georgie carter he says oh you say you believe george all right we'll make that little little string there hanging down from the fan make it move back and forth well brother branham that's spiritualism no it's not i thought you said you believe well i don't know about you but i've been sitting in my room on my bed looking at that little thing oh my i couldn't do it after one year serving god i couldn't do it after five years of serving god and i probably couldn't do it today you want to know why i don't need to make that thing move that's right all i need is the revelation all i need to know is that the mighty god has been unveiled to me the mighty god has been unveiled to me the seventh seal book has been opened to me the seven seals have been revealed seven thunders have uttered their voices and you have heard them and it's those seven thunders that have awakened the bride that's why you're living in revival that's why you're living the way that you're living oh praise god for his word well i don't know where to stop oh hallelujah fourth fourth time the third pool came in the manifestation it spoke to the storm now we're going to see that now now i believe the prophet well we we know this was all a predestinated word and he's breaking down these manifestations to show you what the word will produce in your life don't leave it in history these are just manifestations we saw in the prophet's life a bride member who came to maturity first but we saw that manifestation in our lord and savior jesus christ who was the first one who had rose from the dead he was the first fruit of the resurrection and the scripture says if that same spirit that was in jesus christ dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal body that's exactly what this word is doing it's quickening your mortal body to bring you into a place where all of the word that was spoken of the bride will be manifested in your life oh praise god don't let don't let it fall to the wayside what a glorious hour that we are living in now ye are the sons of god the whole world is groaning and travailing for the manifestations of the sons of god and they are gathered together right here in christian life tabernacle on a sunday evening oh glory to god hallelujah there is a word that is bringing a bride into the fullness of the manifestation that the word has spoken oh you might as well just get excited nothing can hold you down nothing can keep you you might go into the grave but nothing can keep you in the ground just as sure as jesus christ came out of the ground there is a bride coming out of that ground through seven church ages and there will be a people who will not hinder them that are asleep but you'll be changed hallelujah you might as well just start expecting just looking around the corner say charity is that you jonathan is that you i got loved ones i want to see i got loved ones i miss i got loved ones who are behind the curtain of time and i have an expectation in my heart where are they at any day now any day now which one's gonna appear to me first there ought to be such an expectation oh my if we only knew who where we were standing if we could get a revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the church we actually catch the revelation that's been unveiled in this day you are an invincible army church those aren't flattery words that's a revelation hallelujah just moving on a little further if that's all right so we see the manifestations of the third pool the fourth time speaking of the storm and the fifth time watch what the prophet would say here he would say about that fifth time the the lord come come to the prophet and he said the the the way that you say it just the way that you say it will be the way it happens so we see the fourth time then we see the fifth time and i marveled i marveled at that he says he says what was it just exactly according to the word of the lord now now catch something that's taken place every time the prophet speaks about the third pool he never is taking credit for his earthly vessel he never even says i spoke it he says he spoke it because why it was god in the man that's what the son of man ministry is it's the word becoming flesh god in morphe the word becoming tangible now it's it's moving in a direction for you to understand that he's pointing out that it was god in him that spoke it now when we hear the scriptures we've heard it so many times we've actually applied it like it's an intellectual knowledge when the scripture says that greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world then there is a manifestation or a reality that jesus christ is living in you and the prophet would take up that scripture and say at that day ye shall know that i am in the father the father and me and i in you and he would take that and say when the revelation comes forth when the revelation is revealed then it's me and you and i and you it's him in the bride it's god in morphing now living in a mini-membered bride body we're not looking for a corporal potty god is living in the bride body the prophet of god said in the trial he said i challenge you to believe that the manifestation of the son of man ministry is now in the bride's body he was challenged you to believe that now god was becoming flesh in his mini-member body but we want to keep putting god back in history we want to keep putting god back in the prophet but god is wanting to unveil himself to the bride that to know that this third pool revelation is actually his own life living in you it's not you speaking it's him in you speaking the word glory to god let's stand i didn't say we were done but just to change your position so we move a little further right so watch this he says what is it just exactly according to the word of the lord amen now he he's saying exactly according to the word that he spoke brother branham said before the doctor's hand touches her the tumor would be gone now watch the prophet under the anointing now just exactly according to the word of the lord now if we could catch the revelation that is being produced here it's not you that liveth it's christ that liveth in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world it wasn't brother branham speaking it it was the god in brother branham speaking the word amen just exactly according to the word of the lord amen that's the fifth time five is the number of grace and the number of faith two there is no more doubt in my mind thank you i now i know what the third pull is and i know what it does i now know what the third pull is and what it does and i believe that's where we are what what maybe if we're moving towards a point we want to see the word coming into a revelation or an unfolding in our life where we can say like the prophet where we can say i now know what the third pull is and what it and what it does now this is a deep thing god hides himself in simplicity praise god praise god god hides himself in simplicity and reveals himself in the same so it's not some big way off wonder be faithful to the calling in your life keep walking like abraham was walking in obedience to the word and if you're walking in obedience to the word jehovah jireh is with you and when you come up to a need or you come up to a trial jesus is with you to meet you in that trial and in that time of need we don't have to manufacture something we don't have to work up something we don't have to run out on the internet to this preacher run out on the internet to that preacher explain to me the seventh seal explain to me the mysteries oh my i gotta get this thing and put this together and i gotta call this brother i gotta figure out what is the third pool all about what is the son of man what was the land what was the sea what was that me what where is it if i can just figure this all out i'll finally get the rev no no no god elected you just say the right thing to the word howdy wright didn't have any preconceived notion she wasn't sitting around like well when i finally get the chance i'm going to try to give lip service to the prophet and then and then i'm going to ask for my boys no she she didn't even know the opportunity that was and i say church we don't even know we can't even comprehend the opportunity that god has given us but one thing i know i believe it i believe this message with all my heart i've heard the elies are called and i want to go wherever this word takes me and i can look into the word and now i can see well i wish well praise god we're just where we're at there's a manifestation of this word that is coming into bright form amen and so we know what the third poll is we know the opening of the word was revealing christ if you can play something that'll help me stop we we know that the prophet explains these things we you know that what were the seals what were they they were revealing christ christ is those seals that was the ones he was revealing but see it's one thing to recognize the opening of the word it's one thing to recognize the mighty angel but what we want to do is we want to lay in the presence of the sun we want to be that seed that's laying in the presence of the sun and start to see the fruits of the opening of the word in our life and so when we can look into the scriptures and see this mystery of the third pool that was actually happening where the prophet would come to a place and say i now know what the third pool is and what it does it shows me that okay lord i'm i'm moving i'm if the word is constantly moving then this message that i have received is constantly moving me towards a greater manifestation of the opening of the word in my life and i saw the manifestation of it in a first one to maturity so that i know that that same word is now having the same effects and the same fruits in my life amen let's just pray heavenly father lord we love you we love your word lord i pray something that was was said that could just move your bride a step higher lord just to awaken the faith that's in them to know that you're living you're alive you're living in a people lord that we recognize the mighty work that you've done in the seventh angel that visited us we're thankful so much that we've recognized the word that has unfolded but lord as we look back and see the manifestations of scriptures in days gone by we know that the purpose was is for that word to be in manifestation in our life so lord we know that we have a great responsibility to this word and to this message but lord we're thankful to know it's not something we gotta muster up it's not something we gotta manufacture but if we'll just lay in the presence of the sun we'll just walk in obedience to the word just like abraham was walking he was walking with you just like when the prophet stood there in the face of the storm and it was just the way he said it storm you go this way and sunshine for four days when he was obedient to your word and we see the manifestation of what he spoke come to pass that's when you said to your servant will you walk with me lord i believe that's all our hearts desire we just want to walk with you lord and i can echo what the prophet said he'd be the greatest privilege i've ever had lord i believe every one of us could say this has been the greatest privilege we've ever had to receive this message receive this word lord we know the demands of this life are heavy and it's a dark and wicked age lord our heart echoes with the prophet's words to walk with you lord it's the greatest privilege that we've ever had lord we just want to be faithful to our part we love you lord we thank you for your word maybe with everybody's head bowed you just want to lift your hand to the lord and say lord i realize that there's so much more in the word and i'm falling short and i just ask that you come help me maybe you've been backslidden you want to lift your hand and make your life right with god and you want to lift your hand and say lord i realize that i haven't been living right and i'm asking that you would come lord and change me maybe you need the holy ghost and you want to lift your hand up to the lord say lord jesus i believe your word and i want to say the right thing to the word tonight i want to say amen to the word i realize lord that there's a quickening power that i need in my life that'll help me live a victorious overcoming life and i want to receive the holy ghost and you just want to lift your hand up right now and say lord jesus i want to receive the holy ghost god sees that hand god's mindful of that amen if you feel like prayer would help we're here to pray for you lord jesus we just lift our hands to you right now lord you see the needs in our heart we're just asking lord jesus for those that need healing for those that need the filling of the holy ghost for those that have backslidden and are repenting to make their life right with you lord we'll just pray right now father that you would move amongst your
