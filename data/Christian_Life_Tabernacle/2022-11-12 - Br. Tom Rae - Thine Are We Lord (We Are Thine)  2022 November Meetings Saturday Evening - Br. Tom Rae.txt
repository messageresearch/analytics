one sheep that is not in his fold he'll search high and low amen like the eagle that was looking for that part of her that she knew she had two eggs and he hunts the prophet of gods of the Holy Spirit is here done night hunting his own and that brought me to this scripture that I think that we all know so well and it is but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and I I was reading and thinking on my heart and this statement that the prophet of God made and and to see if I can find it here and it comes from the message of called investment and let me see if I just give me a second here and I might have lost it which is the police anyway the prophet of God said this this young man was he was thirsting for something that he saw that's right in the Lord Jesus he wanted to be a partner with it he wanted that life and in this great message the prophet of God says that God gives everybody the opportunity to invest and I I thought you know God really has been here yeah with us so far giving us the opportunity he said that young man was given the opportunity but he didn't take the opportunity to have the new birth amen don't miss the opportunity tonight he's going to come by your way and he's going to give you the opportunity he's going to give you the opportunity to ask what you have need of he's going to give you the opportunity to Touch the Hem of His Garment he's going to as our as our brother preached that that opportunity may just come in a moment yeah just in an unction in your heart just in a a word that's spoken to you to quicken in you a hope and and you reach out and you grab a hold of that and you take the opportunity you open your door and you open your heart and you let it in and I want to thank the Lord for the opportunity that he's given us tonight and I'd like to uh sing that song brother Billy I I don't know what the name of it the young man cried you know [Music] now I don't know if you were here last time but this is where our meeting ended so we're gonna pick it up right where we left off right somebody come up to me and he said oh he said to you and brother Tom were just drunk in the spirit up there amen because we got a God that's great we got a God that cares for us we got a god that'll do it cheatingly abundantly above what we can even think her ass all we got to do is seek the Lord amen you and you be that with all your heart amen let's sing it tonight as we invite my friend [Music] I guess I can say my buddy and and my Sojourner my fellow Warrior and our purpose is to give our lives give the opportunity for everybody to come in contact with the Lord Jesus right help me say it I sought [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you believe it [Music] [Music] wow [Music] next time [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

put on by special people because you're a special person you're very special to me and so father God as we commit this evening service to you I'm just asking that you will take speaker and hear her that you'll bless this assembly that has poured out much Lord sisters the Brethren that we do love dearly and hold dear within our hearts pray that the word of God will find a great entrance into their heart and lives we've heard Lord these last two Services how marvelous they've been pray God that you will take the word now speak to every life we ask it in Jesus name amen amen while you're

mean David I have a good friend here too brother Ken buddy you don't get many in life just don't get men here cherish the ones you have and thank God for the ones he gives you and so I I do Billy I do appreciate all the labors of love that all that have put in to make these meetings possible as we often say but God really knows the effort sometimes the tears and the brothers you've done so much and you've championed a lot you will continue to and Lord willing tomorrow morning I have something on my heart to address that I want to thank the Lord for opportunity to minister with my son I learned a new thing I get to pack his bags yeah marvelous marvelous to have brother Glenn sister Shawna with us from home and special Glenn John always an effort appreciate it Ken and Linda and Ava their granddaughter my goodness and of course my little sweetheart she's hiding around here somewhere Joanne God bless you and Abigail we love you dearly let's turn to the scripture First Corinthians now you think I got the energy what you just saw it ain't gonna happen but for an old fellow somebody said to me the other day not too long ago they said you do not so bad for an old fella I said I didn't know I was old the crazy thought somebody told me I'm old shame on them no sir we're young at heart we love the Lord Jesus well did I say First Corinthians 1 30. did I not say that yet First Corinthians I heard those pages turning foreign now I'm a type of preacher that looks at you right you know me by now so if you're nodding off it's my fault not yours okay First Corinthians chapter one verse 30. but of him are ye in Christ Jesus who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness sanctification and Redemption that according as it is written he that glorifieth let him glory in the Lord let's turn to Second Corinthians chapter 5. II Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21. for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now if you wouldn't mind doing me a favor would you help me read that verse again for he hath made him be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him let's pray one more time Heavenly Father your words Eternal and it is life to us Lord would you open it to every one of us Lord from the youngest to the oldest we ask it in Jesus name amen you may have your seats thank you brother David for the invitation again sister Leslie my goodness we feel like we are home I've looked at I've looked at a few of my travels over the years and it started in 206 and I don't often go to the same place twice in a year but I find out that this is the place that I've come the most twice in a year and now we're at 2 20. 22 22 20 22. I am getting old and uh you haven't changed the BET you've only gotten better you see the young men coming up Matthew Gabriella they made just this tremendous Dave and Juliet Deacons Bible studies I've enjoyed the last couple years they've they've allowed me to say something I don't know whether it was worth it but we had a good time a wonderful time and now we're here in the evening service and one last one after tonight so I I determined to myself I'm not going to hold him much more than 40 minutes I know that you're laughing because that's that's an impossibility even on my end of the stick but I know you're tired and I know you've put a lot in and and uh I appreciate it so bless you your reflection of this great message we love so dearly God be with you I've enjoyed as I said in the prayer I've enjoyed so much the last two Services of brother Michael not that he's just my son he's my son and I love him I thank God for his life so I'm gonna speak a little title on thine are we lord we're yours and maybe the subject will run into tomorrow morning so that's why I said I won't hold you that long in that late but I would love for you to be attentive as we go through the word of God we read out of First Corinthians 1 and 30 and uh the scripture says I'll destroy and help you remember he is the source of your life in Christ Jesus whom God made our wisdom our righteousness our sanctification and our Redemption if I look it up in a few more translations and you take it to the the Greek can you take it through whatever whatever and you find out that you know there are some things in there that may be help you understand a little bit more clearly but it takes the Holy Spirit to make it alive and it goes on to say but it is from him that you are in Christ it's from him that you are in Christ so right away Paul whether it be whether it be Ephesians Colossians Corinthians he's really identifying you in Christ Jesus predestinated before the foundation of the world so this is not a great uh mystery now because we're going to go through it that through a servant of God a messenger of this age we start to really realize who we are in Christ Jesus we are thine and we start to understand we are not just a bunch of weak need Christians that sit around here and wonder why are we here Paul is really laying down in the scripture who we are in Christ Jesus and that is very important because there's a lot of people that are losing their identification and their identity in Christ Jesus and they identify with just the church but I want to be identified with the god that dwells within the church and then it becomes then a more of a reality and a personal relationship with God we have a lovely building and you will have another lovely building of God should tarry but if God doesn't dwell in the building it's just the building and if God is indwelling in the people you're just a people but I want to say that God is dwelling in a people you've caught the moment of time for your new birth you know who you are in Christ Jesus and now we start to identify as the bride of Christ we're going to let the devil know who we are what we're called for and where we're going and there's nothing going to stop us yeah there you go let's close our Bible to have a word of prayer and go home you caught it all in five seconds but it's really the truth you know uh anybody here play football ever that is a tricky question huh oh you do do ya what are you doing out there huh you know spandex just trying to catch it right no but if you ever on a team it's a team effort so they're all there tapping into is the perversion of God there's a there's a there's a quarterback telling you how to play there's a coach everybody's got to do their part they'll criticize the you know the back end front hand side and whatever and didn't do their part they got the statistics yeah no I know you only show up for special meat I mean you know no no no no no no I'm only getting but everybody's got a part to play and everybody really has a part to play when it's a team effort and you really want to win but I want to let you know we already won it is not a question am I going to win if my Prophet is your prophet he said in the rising of the sun you've already made it I saw you over there so I want to ask you the question what's your problem we come to church and we got our woes and we got this catch the moments yeah everybody hear me in the back yeah I know everybody you know I always listen to back at school that's a bad place I hope it's not that way in church huh you hide in the back so the teacher doesn't see you David no so we're we take the word of God seriously it comes with intent and Power and there's many things throughout the ages that they did not know what you know of course today and there's many things that you thought or you hear and we hear is that I've heard that before then why are you watch a football game they throw the same silly ball every game huh and they throw it a certain way and I think the same guy catches it and the place goes nuts am I in a trap is that true huh same place same guy gets the ball quarterback throws is a 350 yard whatever no it's not how ridiculous huh it's a long throw out of the ballpark but it's how and everybody gets excited but then you get to church the most exciting thing that could ever happen when the God has unveiled it the seals are open and when John saw it all that was in heaven and under the heaven heard him say hallelujah amen I bet I wonder what they were doing in Jeffersonville when it was happening heaven was having a good time I'll let you think about that one but Angels rejoice there's another dimension there's another realm that's here and I'd like to delve in and get into that realm but first of all I want to deal with this realm with you and then we'll deal with the Angels tomorrow because they're here with you and brother Brown says they never leave your side he said you have your own personal Angel he that has borne again Son of God Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb has your own personal angel have you said good morning or a good night to him I'll just let that one go too just throwing some things out for you just to get your juices simmering here who we are in the Lord who I'm identified with and what I'm identified with brother Brown said in Revelation of Jesus Christ series taking the same scriptures we took tonight out of second Corinthians 5 and 21 it says we are the very righteousness of God himself being in Christ now he may he make he's very gracious to us he says it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that our Union with him might become the righteousness of God if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him are the very righteousness of God now that one he says is hard for you to take say well I'm the righteousness of God he goes on to clear that up he says to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied because the scripture declares it but the revelation of it's missing it's not real to the majority of God's children it's just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us that will take revelation you heard about that last night so then if we say we have become the righteousness of God it will take a revelation for you to catch that you are indeed the righteousness of God my that should have got you out of your seat it would at a football game that was that was a what a Hail Mary as they call it is that the one where they throw it way down the field we actually have to come to the realization saints of God that we're more than just church members okay when I saw the songs being sung here tonight my my buttons were popping for your pastor does he standing here saying the glories of God we proud absolutely of you no of Christ in you yes I just didn't want you to feel to it but we start to understand because the prophet said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed which is quote often when she understands who she is than the rapture takes place so then it's not just uh come to church to hear a nice sermon and and go home and forget what you heard just know that it was a good time and you might catch a warrior or a phrase but we want that word to turn from spoken to flesh so we are maybe taking my time a little bit as I get younger instead of being a little bit expressive and I'll get there probably hopefully but we want to understand where God is calling us and where we are in him it will take a revelation from almighty God and especially today as we know we're coming to the end of the ages and coming to the edge end of the ages is then coming to a time where the Prophet said we're blending from time to Eternity and there's a crossing over and it's only for those I'll get there to the quote to those that are under expectation for it because it was those that were under expectation that will raise them out of the grave it'll be those that are under expectation that will take the change in the body so that is an important word just hold on to that word so now we're coming to a time and we've come to an age of where we're coming to the summation of all things there will be a time when there will not be any more marriages I'll look over here the boys will take that better than the girls I'm only not kidding but there will be that time there will be a time when everything's over we've taken our last breath and we've taken a change in the atoms who's living for that time who's dwelling on that thought what do you think this message came for just to start another church or to get a people ready for a rapture because they without us cannot be made perfect and they're waiting for us a great host of Heaven is Waiting for you to catch a revelation of rapture but we want to live our lives through our children people force them to be certain things want them to be certain things drive them to be certain things cause complexes and hurts and whatever but really saints of God would come to a place in time where we need to really take inventory and say Lord what is the first and foremost thing on my mind as we approach now the crossing over you say well brother Tom we've heard about this for a long time well you're just fulfilling what the scripture says in Peter we've heard about this coming but there is a time when it is over and uh let me just tell you you've got a crazy fellow over in Russia right now that's got a few missiles getting ready and they're what do you call it inter ballistic intercontinental ballistic missiles now they they're trying trying to tell us that they can get to our continent and how many minutes 30 minutes and brother Brown says now he and he starts laboring the cities that got those bombs names on them I wonder whether that you think that that's filler or do you actually think that that's what a prophet is trying to tell us that they can pinpoint now missiles to a place but then we understand through the word before one Falls ah is it real to you and I'm just digging around the tree I'm just digging around right now just laying a few thoughts out because it has to be real it just has to be real now brother Brown says we are in the time of the opening of the sealed book we are now in the time of redemption it's now time to claim that Redemption to claim it for me and to claim it for you what he redeemed us back from back to everything Adam lost in the garden he has redeemed it back to us now that lamb that took the book we are ready to ask his grace and mercy upon us to open the seven seal book let us look past in that curtain of time just a bit and notice now the title deed the Seal's been open he broke those seals the Mysteries revealed to bring them for us to see all the claims for the redeemed subjects of God so now we we love the time and we love it when the preacher gets all excited and and we talk about Adam and we talk about him walking with the tiger and saying to this mountain be removed and that's what we're being brought back to and we can't even bring ourselves subject to our own temper there's things in life that we have to get this Earth in order for the next Earth to get put into order letting God then becoming the reality within our lives and that we see who we are in him because you will find yourself if you look at yourself you will fail miserably if you look to him to take care of self you will conquer self triumphantly brother Graham says and things that are to be he said that which is in you will take control of that which is on the outside so now those are great statements but now I want to encourage you to take a hold of those statements and say there's things within my own particular life that I need to bring subject to the word of the Lord are we okay right now we're okay because we're not this is just free right now this is all free okay so now we start to understand then that God in his great mind has an uh uh not just an idea of who you are but I've thought of Who You Are and that thought will manifest [Music] as we heard this morning the arrows are flying and he's looking for a womb for that Arrow to land and when that seed flunk is closed in the womb it has its own Natural Life I've never yet come in contact with a pregnant sister in a church who sat at a table and said I sure hope the hands are forming it's a natural event of a promise that when that body starts growing every organ every circulatory blood system nervous system whatever you want is now starting to grow and nobody is having a raw raw period in the morning saying honey let's get our blower out and blow our horn and say son come on let those fingers be so many inches long that's going to be what it is so when the seed lands in your womb there is going to be growth it is not something you manufacture it is something that's already in it all you have to do is say Lord let it be unto me according to your word [Applause] because the word's already impregnated so now it's not going to church to try and be a Christian going to church being a Christian once you've been born again okay because I know I'm just gonna I'm just gonna watch you now I'm watching you now watch what brother Bram says here he says now Isaiah prophesied as Michael was saying this morning there were many arrows shooting or can we say many word scriptures going and when that seed went out from Genesis and it and it said that that seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent that seed saints of God is going to find ground and it's going to bring forth the promise and did it let me ask you the question not assuming that you don't know it didn't happen but did it happen did Jesus come was the prophecy fulfilled then there's a prophecy of a bride and that broad is going to be victorious triumphant sinless spotless who on Earth is it amen you have to come to

can review you can read articles look it up Google it do whatever you want fortune 500s now it's Fortson one thousands and read it up all the CEO women who got to be CEO of companies and they say the biggest regret Brother David is that they didn't stay home and raise their children and that is not me telling you that that is those that made it to the top come on now and you can Google it yourself and find out what this world is producing get a job get a position no no no find yourself be a handmaiden of the Lord now if you have two brother Ramset I'm sorry I'm so I'm I'm getting into pastoral stuff can help me help me huh it seems there's more guys over here so I better go over here but it's true it's just true if you got into tapes this would not be some sort of mystery to you if you listen to what a prophet said you will find your position your hope raising children helping other mothers I better turn the page it says right here Tom Turn the Page there are people in the Old Testament that are your brothers and sisters that weren't even a part of Israel that realized that David was the anointed and that he was going to come into his position Israel was missing it but there were some Gentiles that were getting it and I have to believe saints of God there's some of us that are getting it whether laodicea missed it or not we receive it I preached just a couple weeks ago on Joseph and all of us probably all know all the story of Joseph and we know the trials Joseph went through and we know how his brothers turned on him did he have it easy but was there a prophecy was there an arrow come on stay with me was there an arrow that there would be sheep's vowel right huh the Sun the moon has started couldn't bow right he went to prison he got falsely accused but he came and got on the right hand of pharaoh God had to have him there because there was Jacob in another land that was going to need seed come on God is not interested in Egypt he is only interested in his redeems so God raised him up to sit on their right hand to make a granary the seed for seed amen raise up seed for his seed and God sent the prophet and this Greenery is full it is full seed for seed but you know what when you read Hebrews about the faith chapter when it speaks about Joseph it doesn't tell about his Ascension to the throne it doesn't tell about him going in prison and getting out of prison it doesn't tell him about anything other than when you get out of Egypt take my bones with you what was he interested in Redemption come on he wasn't interested in all this other stuff the only thing he had in his mind Redemption Resurrection all right amen amen hallelujah he knew his position Direction Resurrection oh I got the victory over this that's great and you get that Victory you challenge that devil you beat him down but you keep on thinking of the Resurrection you keep thinking of a change in the atoms in a moment in the twinkling of an eye remember now David was rejected he was the anointed yet rejected this message is the anointed yet is rejected but there were men that rose up that followed David even though he was rejected there were those men that said you're the anointed David we don't care what Absalom says we don't care what Jerusalem says we only care what God Said a prophet anointed you to be king and when you get into your kingdom remember me come on and they stuck with David and they were victorious with David and the Bible says and God gave them cities because they stayed with David you stay with this message [Applause] he has given you a city [Applause] Hallelujah these men had their names you know you know sometimes people say you know I wish my name was in the Bible mine is but don't go farther than that Thomas the faith Giver huh but God had these men's names written down there is either whoever heard of ease or who named their kid either hi either hi easy I don't know what you call a little baby easy and there was names I can't pronounce but they have tremendous meanings easy or easer means to help then you got Obadiah which is a servant of God which is a Hebrew then you have other men e l l e l then you've got elzab dab dab and we laugh at the names but God knows exactly their name written in the book but I don't know about you but my name is written in the book also amen God knows her name and then Israel failed to back up their King so then there was a group of men that came to David and his name was amishai and amishai he was a chief of captains for Israel and he made this lovely exclamation which I've used over the years and he said David thine are we thine are we we are on your side and I'd like to tell the devil all right right now I am the Lords and I'm on the Lord's Side and I am his ten thousands of thousands separated themselves from David but if David would have stayed in Jerusalem The Scholar said those tens of thousands would have stayed with David if he would have stayed in Jerusalem they would have followed David but because David was a fugitive brother Brown said they left David that tells you where their Revelation held and many over these years have fallen away because this message has become a fugitive but as far as God's concerned as God is as far as God is concerned this is the anointed word of the hour and though the tens of thousands wouldn't follow David there was a handful that said we are thine we're on your side David we're going to stand with you in the good times and the bad times whether the israels rejected you or not we're going to stand with you no matter what the Bible says that the weapons of our Warfare are not physical but the weapons are divinely powerful look it up in the Hebrew Greek we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers of wickedness in high places but what God has empowered you with according to the Greek God has given you divine power to conquer Satan's kingdoms and thus Paul writes we destroy Satan's kingdoms his sophisticated arguments it goes also on to say and every exalted proud thing that sets itself up against the knowledge of God God has given you the most powerful weapon on the face of the Earth and that is his word and the atomic bomb is prayer brother Brown goes on to say then how can we do anything else under the fifth seal how can we do anything else besides the power that God has released to us we're not talking about man ox we're not talking about a line we're talking about eagle and you heard about it the biggest chicken scratcher around I like that Mike object lesson we have been anointed by an anointing that has been released in this hour to conquer anything Satan has thrown against you and that's the only Power you can work by that's the only Power that works people don't want to get in the message no power you you know you don't put gas in a a lawnmower what happens it's a glorified push something it's not even a lawnmower can't even cut nothing but if you go if you don't if you get power to it it becomes what it was intended for and if you've got the power of God living in you you're going to have the power that has been intended for to defeat the enemy in laodicea lion oxman eagle we are under the power of God to defeat the Devil anytime any place we all know the quote let's do it remember now we're not hearers of the word only but we're what doers have you looked up the word doer lately door we're not only hearers of the word we're doers of the word that doer in the Greek means power to perform to promise God has given you power to perform to this promise you're closed with his power the church who's the church I got one I get two okay and you're the auction here you can I got three good four come on let's all raise our hand he said the church is himself revealed I'm getting it down to the address now come on David come on Joshua come on roots the church is himself revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed in you amen do you see it you express the word itself that he is God oh here I love this part Satan you know the scripture on that I have taught this people that God is in them and if God is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and do doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move come on Church put them to the challenge that is me I'm under this anointing

everything he owns amen God on the inside working towards the outside God in you God bless you and God be with you this special weekend it's been special God bless you I am [Applause] en I'd like to read to you the quote that um was said uh quite a bit it says now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts he says but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it would expose Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if this people gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for yes right and that she can do the greater work basically what Tom's telling you brother Tom excuse me you can do the greater work what are you standing for the formula is always in God's word she can do the great work she will be an invincible Army all right now you got to follow it all the way through sure if they can get the true revelation of the two spirits in the that the revelation of the of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern wow and withstand the Antichrist spirit you know what it means to apply the token what it means to apply the token is you look through your life and you find the devil you find that Spirit you find that thing and you identify it you got a Tormentor you gotta have it that torments you you gotta call it what it is you gotta separate yourself from it you got to discern that this is the devil anything that's anti-word is Antichrist this is not the world right right this is not the thinking of God this is not what God does every good and perfect thing comes from the father above the father tempted no man right right so in other words this this is not a listening message right it's a doer message we heard that right that was in the sermon tonight so we got to start looking at things that are ungodly worldly yeah not true right right Satan is the accuser of the brethren but it can't be laid to your charge but you're letting Satan lay it to your charge here letting that luck yeah that's me I'm terrible no he can't lay that to you identify him right Satan you're a liar liar Satan this is not me I am not I'm not going to take this sickness I am not going to take his habit I am not going to take this disease I am going to apply the token another father God says applying the token was casting it out yes sir click get it out yeah call it what it is identify it amen so if there's something going on identify it identify it for what it is don't take credit for it exactly exactly don't be in fellowship with it tell it you hate it I hate that I get angry I hate that I get mad it's the devil I hate that I lust I hate that I have bad thoughts I I hate that I'm lazy [Applause] yeah I found one thing I was a pastor you know who borrows money from me the most the people who don't pay their ties it's like clockwork identify this stuff yeah I mean what else can God do he told you who you are okay but you've got to understand after you know who you are yeah I I remember preaching this to you that after we know who we are right then we got to know what were to do we've got something to do and what we've got to do first is identify the devil in our lives right identify where he's tormenting us from identify him when he's on our children identify him wherever he's at discern it call it out he tries to appear as an angel of Light he tries to put fluffy Wings on him in a little Halo on himself and just said no no it doesn't line up with the word is what Antichrist identify the Antichrist spirit and with stand it then she becomes yes sir I mean just the fact that you all jump up and say I'm it yeah yeah that's half of it yes now what do you got to do with who you are what do you have to do with the power that was Reviving you tonight by the preaching of the word of God that brought you to your feet the whole idea of this gospel is to get it out of religion and put it in reality living find the devil sir find them hunt them down go after them beat your plowshares into swords and go fight the fight apply the token start getting rid of the devil get them out of your life let's start with standing up let's start Discerning them yeah yeah let's find them where he's at let's look over turn every stone in your life find out if he's hiding somewhere I remember going through a real hard time I couldn't figure it out and I remember being on an airplane and just my heart just thinking you know what is it and all of a sudden come by a little conversation I had with somebody in something mean I said oh it seems so simple I just thought oh God can that be it and I remember I went and made that right I tell you a ton of bricks lifted off me I couldn't imagine something so long you know what the scripture says and this is to you love hides a multitude of sins never broadcasts that never calls anybody never tells them

under a rock he'll hide somewhere but are you willing to say Lord I want to be totally exposed I want you to search every part of my being and when I see something that's not right I'm not going to say that's me I'm going to say that's him yeah exactly that's the devil that's the devil that's the devil you might say well I got an awful lot of devils yeah but you got an awful big God right if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart I just think we've laid down a little bit and let him take too much of our land we've let him take too much of our possessions it's time to drive
