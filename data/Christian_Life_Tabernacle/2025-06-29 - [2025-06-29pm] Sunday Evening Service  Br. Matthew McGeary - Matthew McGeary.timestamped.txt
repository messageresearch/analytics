[20:53] The brothers that are taking the
[20:54] offerings if you could come at this
[20:55] time. Brother, if you could just come
[20:57] and fix this needs before the church.
[20:59] Amen.
[21:02] Let's bow our hearts. Gracious heavenly
[21:05] father, Lord, we're so thankful once
[21:07] more to be in your house, Lord Jesus,
[21:10] on a Sunday night, Lord, when
[21:13] could have been doing many other things,
[21:15] Lord Jesus, this world partakes in. But,
[21:18] Father, it's in our hearts, Lord. It's
[21:20] it's a cry that when the doors are open,
[21:23] we've been told to be in your house,
[21:24] Lord Jesus. And I believe the people
[21:27] didn't come into your house tonight just
[21:29] because they were told so, but they have
[21:31] a hunger to be in your presence when the
[21:32] doors are open, Father. I pray that you
[21:35] pour out to them a special blessing
[21:36] tonight. Lord, that you set the mana
[21:38] aside, Father, fresh mana from heaven
[21:41] may come down, Lord Jesus. We heard it
[21:43] this morning, that spark, Lord, that
[21:45] brings the dynamics to us, Lord Jesus,
[21:48] and causes us to live that life, Lord,
[21:50] to show proof of the resurrection, Lord
[21:52] Jesus. It's one thing to say that he is
[21:55] risen, Father, but it's another thing to
[21:57] see that resurrection life living in us,
[21:59] Lord Jesus. Father, I believe
[22:01] everybody's heart's desire in this
[22:03] building is to see the resurrection life
[22:05] living through them, participating in
[22:07] and taking part in the benefits of the
[22:09] resurrection. Lord Jesus, it's no longer
[22:12] the time with all that's going on in
[22:13] this world, modern events made clear by
[22:15] prophecy. It's no longer time to guess,
[22:18] Lord, and wonder, am I saved? Am I a
[22:20] child? Am I a We don't have time for
[22:22] that, Lord Jesus. You settled it at
[22:24] Calvary. Father, all we have to do is
[22:26] accept the sacrifice, Lord Jesus, and
[22:29] walk in your blessings, Lord. Father, we
[22:31] thank you, Lord Jesus. Father, you saw,
[22:33] Lord, the hearts of the people that came
[22:35] into your house, Father, the requests
[22:37] that were read this morning, Lord, and
[22:39] the ones that were mentioned just now,
[22:40] Father, you know them all, Lord Jesus.
[22:43] You have the answer to them all, Lord
[22:45] Jesus. Even the unspoken ones, Lord
[22:47] Jesus. Father, you you told us that our
[22:50] thoughts ring louder in heaven, Lord
[22:51] Jesus. So, Father, even though we may
[22:53] not have wrote something down for for a
[22:55] request for prayer, Lord Jesus, but thou
[22:58] has heard it from your seat, Lord Jesus.
[23:00] And Father, I I love it when a prophet
[23:02] says that when a child of God is
[23:03] challenged, he must come on the scene,
[23:05] Lord Jesus. Father, we're a needy
[23:07] people, Father. There's so many needs
[23:09] within the body, Lord Jesus. Thank God
[23:11] for a living God that comes down when
[23:13] his children need him, Lord Jesus.
[23:15] Father, be present, Lord Jesus. Show
[23:17] yourself to us, Lord Jesus. show up in
[23:20] our lives and our walk, Lord, and work
[23:21] and all the things that we do, Father.
[23:23] We want to see Christ present, Lord
[23:25] Jesus. Not just us, Father. May those
[23:27] around us, Lord, be able to see that
[23:29] something on the inside is different,
[23:32] Lord Jesus. That they may ask, Lord,
[23:34] what causes you to walk this way,
[23:36] Father, that we might be focused on that
[23:38] gaining of a soul, Lord Jesus. We're
[23:40] supposed to shine, Lord Jesus. We're
[23:42] supposed to be lighouses in this day,
[23:44] Father. But sometimes Lord, even within
[23:46] myself, it seems I'm more in darkness
[23:47] than I am in light, Father. But with the
[23:50] revelation that we've received, Lord
[23:52] Jesus, what can stand against Lord
[23:54] Jesus? What trials can raise up to make
[23:56] the believer doubt, Father, if we truly
[23:58] know and believe that thou art with us,
[24:00] and you'll never leave us nor forsake
[24:02] us, but you're in us, Lord Jesus, till
[24:04] the end, Father, we would walk
[24:06] different, Lord Jesus. We would talk
[24:08] different, Lord. Our behavior would look
[24:10] different, Lord Jesus. Are we not
[24:12] significantly impressed, Lord, that you
[24:14] spoke and said, "You are with us, Lord
[24:16] Jesus. We are that bride, Lord Jesus. We
[24:18] are that voice to the final age, Lord
[24:20] Jesus." Father, bless the remainder of
[24:22] the time that we'll spend here, Lord.
[24:24] Bless the tithes and the offerings,
[24:26] Lord. The hands of those that will give,
[24:27] Father. Those that have it in their
[24:29] heart to give but aren't able to, Lord
[24:31] Jesus. Father, bless them, Lord Jesus,
[24:33] that they might be able to give, Father.
[24:35] But as the testimony of the woman that
[24:37] gave all that she had, Lord Jesus.
[24:39] Father, even if it's little, Lord, you
[24:41] never return void. Lord Jesus, when we
[24:44] give unto you, you bless 10 times what
[24:46] we've poured out. Lord Jesus, teach us
[24:48] not just to tithe in finances, but in
[24:50] our time, Lord Jesus, to give you a
[24:53] portion of our time every day, Lord
[24:54] Jesus. We give into so many other
[24:57] things, Lord. But the main thing is you,
[24:59] Lord Jesus. Help us, Lord Jesus. Be with
[25:02] the minister, Lord. Touch your people,
[25:05] Father. We ask these things in the
[25:06] precious wonderful name of the Lord
[25:08] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[25:11] Greater
[25:13] than all
[25:16] my
[25:18] sins

[33:02] [Music]
[33:09] Hallelujah. Amen.
[33:12] Well, here we are in the evening time
[33:13] once again.
[33:16] Amen. I believe some of the special
[33:19] moments a believer has had has been in
[33:21] the evening time and an evening service
[33:23] where maybe the crowds are a little bit
[33:25] lighter and maybe you're a little bit
[33:27] tireder and it took a little bit more
[33:30] effort and a little bit more
[33:32] perseverance, but God likes to see those
[33:35] things in the believer. And sometimes
[33:38] that's exactly what he likes to do is
[33:40] just let it get a little hard and a
[33:41] little difficult and just to see you
[33:43] press a little bit just to press through
[33:46] and to make an effort. He likes to see
[33:49] that and it makes him happy and I tell
[33:52] you when you start talking about him he
[33:53] draws nigh and he listens and he comes
[33:56] close. Why don't we talk to him? Lord
[33:59] Jesus,
[34:03] Lord, we're humbled to be standing
[34:07] in this place once again,
[34:11] Lord, but it's your grace and your mercy
[34:13] that would call us, elect us, and choose
[34:15] us.
[34:17] Not that we would look in into any
[34:20] ability of what a man could provide,
[34:22] Lord, but it's been all your grace, all
[34:24] your strength, all your mercy.
[34:27] It's been your choosing, Lord. And we
[34:30] rejoice in that.
[34:33] Now Lord, we've come to this evening
[34:34] service and just looking to you
[34:38] Lord that something would be done or
[34:40] said that
[34:43] would draw the people closer to you and
[34:48] bring a revelation,
[34:50] something quickened, Lord, that they
[34:52] would have for themselves that they
[34:55] could cherish it and testify about it.
[34:58] And
[35:00] Lord, that's what we all want. We want
[35:03] to become part of your word. Not just
[35:05] something that we point to way out
[35:06] yonder, but something that's in us,
[35:09] living in us, that's changing us and
[35:12] molding us and making us like you, Lord.
[35:14] So, we love you. We thank you for the
[35:16] songs and the atmosphere that's here,
[35:18] Lord. And just pray you'd come amongst
[35:20] us now and break the bread of life as
[35:22] only you can. We pray. Amen. God bless
[35:25] you. Amen. If you have your Bibles,
[35:28] um,
[35:30] we can, uh, read out of, uh,
[35:34] uh, Hebrews, uh, chapter 11. Um,
[35:40] you know, I I got to be a little honest.
[35:42] I I was we had a little rough little
[35:46] rough go last night and this morning.
[35:48] Um, we're just praying that uh,
[35:50] Brianna's recovering well. The family's
[35:53] at home, some of us not feeling well.
[35:54] Um, Brianna, her ears, she got a ear
[35:56] infection. We believe that her ears had
[35:59] swollen up where they were actually
[36:01] closing. The canals were closing. And so
[36:03] we we brought her um just wanted to
[36:06] react quickly and went and got some help
[36:09] this morning. And and uh so we were we
[36:12] were resting uh this afternoon and my
[36:15] wife came in and woke me up and said,
[36:17] "Your dad's trying to get a hold of
[36:18] you." And I was a little in the flesh. I
[36:21] said, "I'm not preaching."
[36:24] You know, um, but that's our flesh,
[36:27] right? And so we we all have a duty and
[36:31] a responsibility and and um I was
[36:34] talking to brother Billy back there and
[36:37] uh I was like, my if if if we preached
[36:41] when we wanted to or when we felt like
[36:43] it, we would never do it.
[36:46] Oh my. I'm sorry, but it's just um it's
[36:50] a death you die and that's just the way
[36:53] it has to be because we don't want to
[36:55] see man. We want to see God in his word.
[36:58] So you pray for me. Um we just maybe see
[37:02] just try to take a little something and
[37:04] I know God will multiply it. Uh Hebrews
[37:08] 11 and 5 if you're there reads by faith
[37:12] Enoch was translated that he would not
[37:14] see death was not found because God had
[37:18] translated him before his translation he
[37:20] had this testimony that he pleased God.
[37:22] You may have your seats and also uh
[37:25] let's just turn over
[37:27] into Romans chapter 8.
[37:34] I tell you that this this this the
[37:35] sermon that our our pastor is in the
[37:38] rising of the sun and the Easter seal to
[37:40] me is just the very heart of God and the
[37:42] heart of the message and the hour that
[37:45] we're now living in. In Romans 8:11, it
[37:48] says Romans
[37:51] chapter 8 verse 11, "But if the spirit
[37:53] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[37:55] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[37:58] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[38:00] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[38:03] dwelleth in you." And um another sermon
[38:07] our pastor's uh been ministering now was
[38:09] the Easter Seal. And I I just wanted to
[38:12] um catch a little out of that paragraph.
[38:15] I believe I'll just start at 111
[38:18] and read down to to um 114. He says,
[38:23] "And there's no devil, no church or any
[38:26] theology that can overcept the boundary
[38:29] of God's proof and abstract.
[38:32] The baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[38:34] recognized us in Jesus Christ. We're
[38:37] just as sure to raise as he raised
[38:40] because potentially we have already
[38:42] raised in him." Amen. And and I I I you
[38:46] know we we know that we are promised to
[38:49] meet the Lord in the air and that will
[38:51] be the final quickening. Uh it will be
[38:54] the fullness of our adoption. But right
[38:57] now we know that we are already
[38:59] resurrected in Christ Jesus sitting in
[39:03] heavenly places. He goes on to say the
[39:06] old things what uh the old things what
[39:09] does it do to our mortal bodies?
[39:12] Now, what does the quickening power do
[39:14] to our mortal bodies? Uh, many times
[39:17] when we read the scripture, we're we're
[39:19] looking for something to come in the
[39:21] future. Um, but I I would say that's
[39:24] what the prophet always cautioned us to,
[39:27] that man's always looking to what God
[39:28] has done. He's always looking to the
[39:31] future of what he's going to do, but
[39:32] he's failing to see what God is doing
[39:36] right now. And the prophet is showing
[39:38] us, he says, "The old things, what does
[39:40] it do to our mortal bodies? It turns our
[39:44] opinions changes our notions. It sets
[39:49] our affections on things which are
[39:52] above. And the smoking, drinking,
[39:55] gambling, the things that you used to do
[39:58] is dead. It's where is it? It's beneath
[40:02] you." And we know those things are
[40:04] always trying to resurrect itself,
[40:06] right? Maybe trying to Satan's always
[40:08] trying to sew a seed or catch your
[40:10] attention and and you know, you get into
[40:12] the book of of Romans and Paul says,
[40:14] "You got to be uh you you you got to be
[40:17] married to another and and the prophet
[40:19] would take that and I believe would
[40:21] preach invisible union." And he and he
[40:23] would show, I believe it's a prophecy
[40:25] concerning the church in the last days.
[40:27] And he would even come through the
[40:28] church ages. And so that look, the
[40:30] church can no longer be lawful and legal
[40:33] about it because now we have the
[40:35] fullness of the word. We can be married
[40:37] to Christ and a and and some of these
[40:40] little ideas and false doctrines and
[40:42] things that men probed at down through
[40:44] the years. Uh the opening of the word
[40:46] has has shine a light into the darkness
[40:47] and now we have the fullness of the word
[40:50] that we could be married to that word.
[40:51] And and what it's done is it's it's
[40:53] resurrected us out of the dark
[40:55] denominations and unbelief and dead
[40:57] denominations. And now it's set us up
[40:59] upon a rock of revelation that we can be
[41:01] in a a union with Jesus Christ. And all
[41:04] of those things are beneath us. Uh all
[41:06] the false doctrine and the way that we
[41:08] used to live and and our ideas and our
[41:11] opinions and it says, you know, let this
[41:13] mind be in you that was also in Christ
[41:15] Jesus, let us go on unto perfection. A
[41:18] and all of those things aren't just some
[41:20] ideas or fancy words, but it's something
[41:22] that the quickening power is producing
[41:25] in the believer that we are actually
[41:27] becoming the word. The prophet of God, I
[41:29] believe in perfect with faith, would
[41:30] say, as you receive the word, you become
[41:33] the word. So, as we're feeding on this
[41:35] word, we're becoming more and more like
[41:37] him. And we are just like Enoch. We are
[41:40] walking with God. We are walking with
[41:42] Jehovah. and step by step, one of these
[41:45] days, we're going to be changed in a
[41:47] moment, in a twinkling of an eye, and we
[41:49] will be out of here. And he goes on to
[41:51] say, so as we just lay in that
[41:53] principle, what the prophet is saying,
[41:54] it it changes everything. And I just
[41:56] want to encourage you if if your
[41:58] opinions haven't been changed and and
[42:00] your your your your appetites and your
[42:02] desires haven't been changed, and maybe
[42:04] you're still listening with world
[42:07] worldly music and certain things. And I
[42:09] can understand a struggle maybe, you
[42:11] know, cuz uh some of us, you know,
[42:13] there's always a punch coming. God's not
[42:14] going to shove you through a pipe and
[42:16] just pull you out on the other side and
[42:18] say, "Well done, my good and faithful
[42:19] servant." Some of there's some things
[42:21] that that are left for us to overcome
[42:23] because it's to him that overcometh. And
[42:25] we're more than conqueror. So, there's
[42:27] going to be some things that you have to
[42:28] overcome. And and may maybe maybe uh uh
[42:32] your struggle is every once in a while a
[42:34] song gets back in your head or or or or
[42:37] you accidentally turn on the radio and
[42:39] and or you go into this um store or
[42:42] something and something gets stuck in
[42:44] your mind and your heart, you got to do
[42:46] battle with that. But I would say if I
[42:48] if it's an appetite and something you
[42:50] feed on um almost unconsciously, you
[42:53] need another nature.
[42:55] Uh I if if you unconsciously uh just
[42:58] turn on the radio and you're listening
[43:00] to the music and it's it's country radio
[43:02] or pop music and then something starts
[43:04] saying, you know, I shouldn't do this.
[43:06] Well, I I I would like to like it to see
[43:09] it the other way around, you know, where
[43:11] where where where uh uh uh that happens
[43:13] a lot quicker where where all of a
[43:16] sudden something catches your ear and
[43:17] you might be like, "Oh man, I remember
[43:18] that song." And then something's like
[43:19] saying, "Don't do it, son. Don't do it,
[43:21] daughter. You shouldn't do that." And
[43:22] maybe you maybe you stuck around a
[43:24] little too long and listened to a little
[43:25] bit, but you feel terrible, right?
[43:28] Because you're a child of God. You have
[43:29] another nature. You can't feed on those
[43:31] things. But but I would say if you still
[43:33] have those appetites and you struggle
[43:34] with those things, I would encourage
[43:36] you, you know, you know, to to repent of
[43:38] your sins, re repent of of the wrong
[43:41] things that you've done and the
[43:42] iniquities that that you have had. And
[43:44] and and I would say that if if you could
[43:46] hear the word of God calling you and
[43:48] saying there's a better way, there's a
[43:50] higher calling. You don't you don't have
[43:51] to live like that. And I would say if
[43:52] there's a desire in you to be free from
[43:54] that, praise God because there's a lot
[43:56] of people they they don't have that
[43:58] desire. I remember one time going over
[44:00] to uh one of my uh uh friends house.
[44:03] I've known him for many years. He's a
[44:04] professing Christian, does uh uh you
[44:07] know uh does prison ministry and he he's
[44:10] involved and he's outspoken and he
[44:12] really uh professes the faith of Jesus
[44:14] Christ. And I remember just standing in
[44:16] there in the in his home and I saw these
[44:18] liquor bottles on the on the counter and
[44:20] I just thought to myself, my what my
[44:21] what a pity that that people can live in
[44:24] a condition and think that they're okay
[44:26] and and to think that he could he could
[44:28] profess Jesus Christ but be comfortable
[44:30] in his sin. I say what what a what a
[44:33] dangerous uh uh position to be in. But
[44:36] if if if you're doing something that you
[44:38] know is not right and God is is showing
[44:40] you that, praise God. I mean we we we
[44:42] were all born in sin shaped in iniquity.
[44:44] We come into the world speaking lies and
[44:46] we all have to come to the place where
[44:48] we are born again and we're baptized and
[44:50] filled with the Holy Ghost. And if God
[44:52] has put that call on your life, a
[44:54] repenting is a turning away from. So
[44:56] then repent of your sins. Say, "Lord, I
[44:58] am sorry. I I don't want to be this
[45:00] way." And maybe you fall back in that.
[45:02] That's okay. He promised to give you the
[45:04] comforter. And so then when you repent
[45:06] of your sins, you say, "I don't want to
[45:08] live that way anymore, God. Lord, you're
[45:10] dealing with my heart. I I I I want
[45:12] something else to give me power over
[45:14] these things that I'm battling. Well,
[45:15] repent of your sins and then you have a
[45:16] promise. If you're baptized in the name
[45:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall
[45:20] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[45:22] then you stand upon that word, God. I've
[45:24] I've taken you at your word. If you
[45:26] fall, you get back up. Lord, I plead the
[45:28] blood of Jesus Christ. I've fallen
[45:29] again, Lord. But I believe there's a
[45:31] power. I believe there's a strength. I
[45:32] believe there's a Holy Ghost that can
[45:34] give me the victory over these things.
[45:35] And you never make a compromise with the
[45:37] devil. You never settle. You never say,
[45:39] "Well, this is just going to be the way
[45:40] it is. I'm I'm always going to go
[45:41] through cycles and and you know I'm
[45:43] always going to fall to the temptation.
[45:45] I rebuke that spirit. I rebuke that
[45:47] devil. You can be an overcomer and you
[45:49] are more than a conqueror in Christ
[45:51] Jesus. And so you can press uh toward
[45:54] the mark of the high calling of Jesus
[45:55] Christ. You do not have to settle for
[45:57] second rate. You don't have to settle
[45:59] for anything less than your privilege. I
[46:01] mean the heavens are open. If if you
[46:04] know I I'm reminded of the quote brother
[46:06] Brandham said if if if you have you know
[46:08] if if you have faith to walk like Enoch
[46:10] walked and be translated and out here he
[46:12] said don't let me keep you from doing I
[46:14] say to me what that speaks of of course
[46:15] that was the sheath wave showing us how
[46:17] to get there but but what it what it
[46:19] shows is that hey uh if somebody can
[46:22] believe for the supernatural and
[46:24] perfection and and my it's available
[46:28] I mean I mean the heavens are open for
[46:30] for the believers so you know but we
[46:33] want to get to the place where those
[46:34] things he says right here that uh uh uh
[46:37] it it chang it sets our affections on
[46:39] things which are above and the smoking,
[46:42] drinking, gambling and things that you
[46:43] used to do is dead. It's beneath you.
[46:45] Now he he points out to some really um
[46:48] uh uh obvious things but I believe as a
[46:51] Christian, you know, there the the the
[46:54] lying, the cheating, the stealing, the
[46:55] dishonesty, the white lies, you know,
[46:58] being deceptive. You know, I I I just
[47:00] remember this one time I I had called a
[47:02] customer
[47:03] And um you know and and and uh they they
[47:06] answered the phone. Hello. I said I said
[47:09] uh uh yeah. Yeah. Is and I think um I
[47:13] think on the work order had you know Tom
[47:15] and Sally. I said hey Tom is Sally
[47:17] there. And he was like this is Sally.
[47:19] And I'm I went um uh uh say that again.
[47:24] I can hear you now. I said oh Sally.
[47:25] Sally how you doing? And in my heart,
[47:28] I'm like,
[47:31] I hung up the phone and said, "Lord,
[47:32] that wasn't right." I I I I was
[47:34] embarrassed and I acted like the phone
[47:37] was, you know, breaking up. And I said,
[47:40] "Lord, you give me an opportunity
[47:43] to make that right." And God gave me the
[47:46] opportunity, and I told her, I said,
[47:47] "You know, I'm sorry. the other day. Um
[47:50] I uh I said the phone was breaking up,
[47:52] but I I was embarrassed because I
[47:54] assumed that that you were your husband.
[47:57] And she was she just said, "Oh, I I got
[47:59] an old smoker's voice, but you know
[48:01] what? I appreciate appreciate your
[48:02] integrity and testimony. That'll that'll
[48:05] do more for people or something." She
[48:06] said something profound. And I was like,
[48:08] "Wow, you know, and but it's little
[48:11] things like that, you know, the
[48:13] fine-tuning, the holding down. It's just
[48:14] that we don't just get to the place
[48:16] where I've come out of the world, you
[48:18] know, and and I'm unspotted by the
[48:19] world. But no, we want to be so much
[48:21] like Jesus Christ that our actions and
[48:23] our thoughts and our desires a and and
[48:26] we have a vision. Jesus did, you know,
[48:28] John 5:24, he did nothing but what the
[48:30] father showed him to do. I I believe
[48:32] there is a perfection where we are so
[48:34] hidden in Christ, a hidden life behind
[48:36] the veil, where we're feeding on the
[48:38] word and we're being led by the spirit
[48:40] of God that all of those things are
[48:42] beneath us.
[48:43] are are are is that okay? So that's what
[48:46] the quickening power does. It sets your
[48:49] affections on things which are above.
[48:51] And I say, oh my, it's so easy in the
[48:53] world that we now live in where our
[48:56] affections are on everything else. And I
[48:58] can't remember what sermon it is. I I
[49:00] believe it's Christ the mystery of God
[49:02] revealed. He he says uh uh uh you know
[49:05] what is that hunger? What is that
[49:06] thirsty? God's wanting to reveal this
[49:08] great revelation to you. He said, "But
[49:10] we let so many things take it out of us.
[49:12] We And then he says, "Things that are
[49:14] lawful. We let our family. Will you let
[49:17] your wife?" And all a sudden you're
[49:18] like, "What? The the very things that
[49:21] are lawful for you to do to take care of
[49:23] the family and to make a living." But he
[49:25] says it's those things that you let take
[49:27] it out of you from receiving this great
[49:29] revelation in the hour that we have. And
[49:31] so we we we want this quickening power
[49:34] to set our affections on things that are
[49:36] above.
[49:38] And maybe I could just say this in the
[49:40] outset is maybe we don't even maybe that
[49:44] just sounds like a a fancy term. Set our
[49:48] affections on things above. But we used
[49:51] to have desires for the things of the
[49:54] world, right? And maybe we could we
[49:57] could think of something, but I don't
[49:58] know if every anybody's ever had a
[50:00] craving for for for a hamburger or
[50:03] you've had a craving for Mexican food,
[50:05] right? It's just it's a hunger, right?
[50:07] It's and and and and oh, and if you
[50:09] smell it, man. And and and then it's
[50:11] it's something that you desire and you
[50:13] start to set your affection. You start
[50:15] to set your and you start to make
[50:16] decisions and put yourself into position
[50:19] that you can partake of those steak
[50:21] fajitas with the grilled onions and the
[50:23] guacamole and the reffried beans and,
[50:26] you know, the homemade tortilla. You
[50:28] anybody know what I'm talking about?
[50:30] Right? And all of a sudden, you you
[50:32] start to desire or crave something. And
[50:36] I don't know about you, but when I was
[50:38] in the world, there there's a lot of
[50:39] substitutes that Satan has come up with
[50:43] to offer you in place of the word, in
[50:46] place of what Christ has for you. So, he
[50:49] wants you to set your affections on all
[50:50] these worldly things and get you so busy
[50:53] and so distracted. But now, the
[50:55] quickening power has come to us that we
[50:57] might set our affections on things that
[50:59] are above. If I if I could say that,
[51:01] that is the message of the hour. It is
[51:04] Jesus Christ. It is the mind of God. It
[51:07] is the word in your season. It's what
[51:09] God's wanting to do right now. I want to
[51:11] set my affections on what does God want
[51:13] to do tonight. Not just the big picture
[51:16] someday. We're going to go in a rapture
[51:18] and kumbaya. We're a big old family, but
[51:20] I got to go back to work tomorrow. But
[51:22] no, man. May I my affections be on the
[51:24] supernatural that that Christ has come
[51:26] where two or three are gathered. I'll be
[51:29] in the midst. to think that the angel of
[51:31] the Lord encaps around those that fear
[51:33] him and he is present now right here in
[51:35] our midst and there's people with
[51:37] afflictions and addictions and things in
[51:39] their lives that have been bound and
[51:41] they are not free and their affections
[51:43] are not on things above but there is a
[51:45] quickening power that if we can come
[51:47] into one mind and one accord and start
[51:49] praying for the brothers and the sisters
[51:51] and for weward ones and prodical sons
[51:53] and prodical daughters that we can be
[51:55] raptured up into a supernatural
[51:57] condition this evening and see see the
[52:00] supernatural things moving amongst us
[52:02] and see our young children uh uh may
[52:04] maybe the days that's been on them all
[52:06] their life just break away from them and
[52:08] they catch a revelation that Jesus
[52:10] Christ he is the same yesterday today
[52:12] and for it's not just a story it's not
[52:15] just a set of rules it's not just
[52:17] regulations and my mommy and daddy
[52:19] telling me how long I could wear my
[52:20] skirt and why I can't do this and why I
[52:22] can't do that but no there's actually a
[52:24] life where where there's a transforming
[52:27] power that quickens the seed and all a
[52:29] sudden your affections want to please
[52:31] the Lord. Lord, does that please you? I
[52:33] want to wear a dress that pleases you. I
[52:35] want to my wear my hair like it pleases
[52:37] you. I only want to listen to things
[52:38] that please you. Lord, if going to
[52:40] church three times a week pleasing you,
[52:42] let me be in church three times a week,
[52:43] Lord. If listening to the message
[52:45] pleases you, let me listen to the
[52:46] message, Lord. You want me to testify.
[52:48] Oh, let my affections be set on things
[52:51] above. Amen.
[52:56] And then you find out all those other
[52:58] things are beneath you.
[53:01] And I like this. He says, "And you are
[53:03] quickened." Amen.
[53:06] And this quickening power
[53:09] brings your body into a raptured
[53:12] condition
[53:14] already.
[53:16] Well, we got room tonight.
[53:19] We could have a track meeting here.
[53:21] Did you hear what the prophet of God
[53:23] just said?
[53:25] I like this. And you are quickened. And
[53:28] this quickening power brings your body
[53:30] into a raptured condition already.
[53:34] What are you waiting for?
[53:38] God's just waiting on you to accept what
[53:41] he's already done. That's it.
[53:45] A vindicated prophet said, "And you are
[53:47] quickened." And this quickening power
[53:50] brings your body into a raptured con.
[53:54] I'm I am in a raptured condition.
[53:57] You might not like what you see, but God
[54:00] likes what he sees because he's looking
[54:02] through the blood and he sees the seed
[54:04] that was that was spoken before the
[54:06] foundation of the world. It ain't me. It
[54:08] ain't my good living. It ain't my flesh.
[54:10] It ain't my ability to go to church. It
[54:12] ain't my works and my fruits that I
[54:14] offered up as some great sacrifice. No,
[54:17] this is something that God has done
[54:19] because why? He is Jehovah Gyra. He's
[54:22] able of these stones to rise up children
[54:24] unto Abraham. I ask you when Abraham got
[54:26] to that place on the mountain and Isaac
[54:29] said, "Oh Abraham, oh father, where is
[54:31] the sacrifice? Where is the ram?" God is
[54:34] able to provide himself a God is able to
[54:38] provide himself a bride.
[54:40] God is able to provide him a bride
[54:42] without spluttering. I'm not going to
[54:44] provide it. Brother Billy ain't going to
[54:46] provide it. Brother David ain't going to
[54:48] provide it. What he has provided it by
[54:51] the spoken word God coming down in flesh
[54:55] and speaking a bride into existence.
[54:58] Therefore, you are literally the spoken
[55:01] word of God taking on flesh in the
[55:04] evening time. That makes me feel good.
[55:09] Not something I'm depending on in
[55:11] myself,
[55:12] but oh, your great Jehovah Eagle has
[55:15] come screaming out and said, "You're
[55:17] justified. You never did it in the first
[55:20] place. Come up higher. Come up out of
[55:22] the chicken. Come up out of your sins.
[55:25] Come up out of your unbelief. Come up
[55:27] out of your denominations. Come up out
[55:29] of your hurt. Come up out of your pain.
[55:32] Come up higher. It's beneath you.
[55:36] I've elected you. I've called you. I've
[55:38] ordained you. I wrote your name in the
[55:41] last book before the foundation of the
[55:43] world.
[55:46] And as you receive that word and believe
[55:49] that word, faith in his word says,
[55:54] my body
[55:57] is already in raptured condition.
[56:01] That means the devil can't get to you.
[56:04] He can't even find you.
[56:07] Hey, I'm feeling pretty good right now.
[56:09] The devil can't get to you. Why? Because
[56:12] you're in Psalms 27 now. Hallelujah.
[56:16] You're in a secret place. In the time of
[56:19] trouble. He shall hide me in his
[56:22] pavilion, in the secret of his
[56:25] tabernacle. I will meet you in there.
[56:28] That'll be the third pull. The opening
[56:30] of the Lord has called you up into
[56:32] heavenly places.
[56:37] Hallelujah.
[56:40] I wasn't going to preach.
[56:42] [Music]
[56:44] We can't escape it, can we, Billy?
[56:47] It's all right.
[56:49] Paul couldn't either. We're in good
[56:50] company.
[56:52] Are you quickened?
[56:55] And you're quickened. And this
[56:58] quickening power brings your body into a
[57:01] rapture condition already.
[57:04] I don't know how
[57:06] God give us the revelation.
[57:10] Now,
[57:12] quickened,
[57:14] raptured condition right now. He said
[57:17] it's a rapturing up, a raising up into a
[57:20] different atmosphere. He said that his
[57:23] disciples were raised up into a
[57:24] different atmosphere than that they had
[57:26] ever been.
[57:27] Have you been raised up there?
[57:30] Or are you still kind of in the
[57:31] automobile and the airplane? You know,
[57:34] nip downs and tuck downs and blowouts.
[57:36] You know, you've never quite broken
[57:38] through the sound barrier. You've never
[57:40] really pressed through and you got down
[57:42] to a place where you've you you've
[57:44] you've got down to a place where you
[57:46] work out your salvation with fear and
[57:48] trembling. Like that one uh brother
[57:50] said, "Look, Lord, I'm going to stay
[57:52] here until I get it. And if you're going
[57:55] to find a pile of bones right here, I
[57:58] ain't getting up until I get the Holy
[58:00] Ghost. I say that's something the church
[58:02] has lost is desperation. You think
[58:04] everything should just be handed to you
[58:06] on a platter with no effort, with no
[58:09] crying out, with no repentance. I say it
[58:11] takes a true repentance. It takes a true
[58:14] heartfelt sorry in the presence of God
[58:17] to say, "God, I don't want to be this
[58:20] way, Lord. I hate the way that I am. I
[58:23] hate my sinning. I hate the things that
[58:25] I'm looking at. I hate my own flesh. I
[58:27] say, "Oh, God, deliver me from this vile
[58:30] man that I am."
[58:32] God, I'm not getting up from this altar.
[58:34] I'm not getting up from my bedside. I'm
[58:37] not coming out of my prayer closet until
[58:39] I got that quickening power.
[58:45] Now you're now now now you're in
[58:48] position.
[58:49] And he says, "When you've met God's
[58:51] requirements, Amen.
[58:53] And that's a surrender. That ain't
[58:56] he don't he don't ask much. He just ask
[58:59] you to believe him.
[59:01] Just take him at his word.
[59:04] And then you can come into a different
[59:06] atmosphere.
[59:08] Oh my. Where things are different.
[59:11] You know, we might be in Lady Osia.
[59:14] We might be in Satan's Eden and my such
[59:18] an evil place that we are living in and
[59:21] and oh the evil and and everything that
[59:24] that's just around you can hardly go
[59:26] anywhere and and it just seems like it's
[59:28] pressing in. I I say one of the most
[59:30] hardest places to go is the mall. I just
[59:32] feel like you walk in the door and it
[59:34] just zaps all your energy and you're
[59:36] you're drained because of all the
[59:38] spirits and and everything that's
[59:39] working and pressing in those realms.
[59:41] But I do want to say that that you don't
[59:44] have to be so much subject. Now we when
[59:45] you go into those grounds and things,
[59:47] you know, you're going to have to do
[59:48] battle. But what I'm getting at, there
[59:50] is an atmosphere for the believer that
[59:52] you can live in a place where you're
[59:54] praying without ceasing and you're
[59:56] thinking on the things of God and your
[59:58] affections have been set on things above
[1:00:00] where where all of these things are
[1:00:02] beneath you and you're living in another
[1:00:03] atmosphere. And I say if you haven't
[1:00:06] been able to live in that kind of
[1:00:07] atmosphere, I invite you tonight that
[1:00:10] you repent of your sins and and you be
[1:00:12] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:14] Christ for the remission of your sins.
[1:00:16] That that that old nature that's been
[1:00:18] rubbing your nose in the muck and mire
[1:00:20] and and making you go here and making
[1:00:22] you go here and lusting after this and
[1:00:24] lusting after that and and you can never
[1:00:26] seem to get free and you fall back down
[1:00:28] in cycles and you and you drink. You
[1:00:30] pick up the bottle. You might be good
[1:00:32] for six months or a year, maybe two
[1:00:34] years, but then you fall right back down
[1:00:36] to that bottle and you drink it. And I
[1:00:38] want to tell you, there's a deliverance
[1:00:39] for you. You can come to a place where
[1:00:41] you are so quickened by the quickening
[1:00:43] power of God that it shuts your
[1:00:45] affections on things above and all of
[1:00:47] those things are beneath you. When that
[1:00:49] old devil comes knocking back on that
[1:00:51] door, it's not just a swept and
[1:00:53] garnished house with no spirit in there,
[1:00:55] but the the but the the the groomsman's
[1:00:57] there, the bride is there. When he opens
[1:00:59] up that door, he says, "Can I help you?"
[1:01:00] He says, "No, you whooped me a long time
[1:01:02] ago on Calvary and you took the keys to
[1:01:04] my own home. I think I'll go somewhere
[1:01:06] else."
[1:01:10] Genesis 5:24 would say, "And Enoch
[1:01:12] walked with God and he was not for God
[1:01:15] took him."
[1:01:17] That's what we read, you know, in our
[1:01:18] text that Enoch had this testimony that
[1:01:20] he pleased God. And
[1:01:23] he he he how many knows without faith
[1:01:28] it's impossible to please him.
[1:01:30] And I'm so thankful faith is a gift.
[1:01:34] 2 Corinthians 5:7 says, "For we walk by
[1:01:37] faith, not by sight."
[1:01:39] So we are walking just like Enoch
[1:01:41] walked.
[1:01:44] We are walking with Jehovah.
[1:01:46] We are walking with the word.
[1:01:50] We are We are listening
[1:01:52] to the word. We're feeding on the word.
[1:01:55] And we're our our affections are on
[1:01:58] things above and we can't beat our type.
[1:02:01] Our type is Enoch.
[1:02:03] I don't know how it all happened, but I
[1:02:06] imagine, you know, one day they saw
[1:02:08] Enoch and one day they didn't.
[1:02:12] Hallelujah.
[1:02:15] Go ahead and take a picture of me now.
[1:02:19] Cuz one of these days I ain't going to
[1:02:20] be here any longer.
[1:02:23] I get happy about it.
[1:02:26] Paul told me to comfort one another with
[1:02:29] these words. He said, "Comfort one
[1:02:31] another because in a moment, in a
[1:02:33] twinkling of an eye, I'm going to be
[1:02:35] changed." Amen. I like to be comforted.
[1:02:40] I like to be told who I am and where I'm
[1:02:43] going. And I like my adversary to be
[1:02:46] reminded of who he is and where he is
[1:02:48] going. I like to be comforted with those
[1:02:50] words to know that man, it might be a
[1:02:53] little rough patch on this side. We
[1:02:54] might be going through some heartache
[1:02:56] and we might be going through some
[1:02:57] trials and we've had some ups and downs
[1:02:59] and we've lost some family members and
[1:03:01] and we we've had some sicknesses and
[1:03:03] we've had some disappointments and we
[1:03:05] have loved ones we thought they would
[1:03:07] still be with us and they've gone on to
[1:03:08] the other side and and there's been a
[1:03:10] lot of suffering. But, you know, my
[1:03:11] Bible tells me if we're going to reign,
[1:03:13] we got to suffer. And we understand that
[1:03:15] character is the only thing that we take
[1:03:17] with us. And and character is a victory.
[1:03:19] So in order to have a victory, you got
[1:03:21] to have a battle. So there's going to
[1:03:22] have to be some things we got to fight.
[1:03:24] There's going to have to be some things
[1:03:25] that we go over. But you know, just
[1:03:27] don't look at the hardship of the
[1:03:28] battle. Don't look at the casualties and
[1:03:30] the things that you've gone through. But
[1:03:32] set your affections on things above. May
[1:03:34] I might have gone through some valleys.
[1:03:36] I might have gone through some hard
[1:03:37] times. We might have lost some loved
[1:03:39] ones, but there's coming a day. I'm
[1:03:41] going to see my loved ones again. I'm
[1:03:43] going to step across the veil. I'm going
[1:03:45] to see those loved ones that have
[1:03:46] already went before me. I'm going to hug
[1:03:48] them and I'm going to embrace them. Oh,
[1:03:49] comfort one another with these words. We
[1:03:51] are going in a rapture. Make no mistake
[1:03:54] about it, saints. We are not living for
[1:03:56] some fairy tale.
[1:04:00] Hallelujah.
[1:04:02] My goodness. People get so worked up and
[1:04:05] happy about winning a trophy. And it
[1:04:08] doesn't it doesn't mean anything the
[1:04:09] next day. They already got the new
[1:04:12] rankings. They already got the new picks
[1:04:13] for the next year. They don't even give
[1:04:15] the team that just won the championship
[1:04:17] any year any time to bask in the glory.
[1:04:20] Well, uh, so and so won the champion
[1:04:21] yesterday. Who do you think going to win
[1:04:22] it next year, man? Give them some time
[1:04:25] to relish in the glory. Ain't no glory
[1:04:26] in this world. It's all destruction.
[1:04:29] It's all death. It's all doom. But oh,
[1:04:32] there is a people standing on the face
[1:04:34] of the earth that their names was
[1:04:35] written on the lamb's book of life. They
[1:04:37] have heard the great eagle scream. And
[1:04:39] guess what? We are going in a rapture.
[1:04:41] We will be changed and above it in a
[1:04:44] twinkle of I comfort ye one another with
[1:04:46] these words.
[1:04:49] My all this perversion and sin heaped up
[1:04:53] around the world. And we just move
[1:04:56] through a thought. But brother Brandon
[1:04:57] would say in one place he says, "Well,
[1:04:59] why do the people do what they do?" He
[1:05:01] said, "Because a monster gots them
[1:05:02] grabbed." He said, "Too much Hollywood,
[1:05:04] too much nonsense, too much TV." And to
[1:05:07] think that we have uh to think as the
[1:05:09] bride we would go putting our nose
[1:05:11] around in that nonsense. The very thing
[1:05:13] that the prophet of God is identifying
[1:05:15] that has caused a monster to grab the
[1:05:17] people through television and and and
[1:05:20] Hollywood and entertainment and music
[1:05:22] and then we go flirt around with the
[1:05:24] things of the world ought not to be. So
[1:05:26] let's possess our vessels and
[1:05:27] sanctification and honor because we have
[1:05:29] a message. We have a quickening power
[1:05:32] that has snatched us out of Lady Osia,
[1:05:34] that has snatched us out of death and
[1:05:36] into life. We got a rapturing word.
[1:05:42] I I know maybe sometimes it's hard when
[1:05:44] we talk about a secret place and hidden
[1:05:46] in his pavilion and in the tabernacle.
[1:05:49] That that's the third pull. That's the
[1:05:51] opening of the word. That's those the
[1:05:52] revelation of those seven seals which
[1:05:54] was what? Revealing Christ.
[1:05:57] That's that secret place.
[1:06:01] We we've had some fellowship on those
[1:06:02] things where where Jesus stood there and
[1:06:05] and said he he Jesus told look your
[1:06:09] fathers did eat mana in the wilderness
[1:06:10] and they're all dead.
[1:06:15] And they said our father gave us bread.
[1:06:16] He said Moses didn't give you that
[1:06:18] bread.
[1:06:21] I like how he discerned their heart
[1:06:22] there who he was calling their father.
[1:06:26] He said Moses didn't give you that
[1:06:27] bread. He said, "I am the bread. My
[1:06:31] father gave you that bread, and I am the
[1:06:33] bread.
[1:06:35] I am the bread that cometh down out of
[1:06:37] heaven."
[1:06:39] Now, you should, we should have the
[1:06:41] same, if I could say it like this, you
[1:06:44] should have the the same struggle with
[1:06:46] that statement today
[1:06:48] as they did. And what I mean struggle
[1:06:51] about it is how can this be? Don't make
[1:06:54] fun of Nicodemus when he came over there
[1:06:56] and Jesus said, "You got to be born
[1:06:58] again." I mean, I don't know if he was
[1:07:00] laughing about it or but it's it it begs
[1:07:03] the question, how can how can I be born
[1:07:05] again?
[1:07:07] I want to be born again, but how? And
[1:07:10] here Jesus is saying, look, if you don't
[1:07:12] eat my flesh and drink my blood, you
[1:07:14] ain't got no life in you. The disciples,
[1:07:17] I I believe, but how? And I say there I
[1:07:21] would pray that there would be something
[1:07:23] in the believer that if if if you at
[1:07:26] least struggle and want to understand
[1:07:28] that as uh brother uh Billy made a
[1:07:31] statement as we were fellowshipping over
[1:07:32] at the youth meeting that it ought to
[1:07:33] provoke some curiosity
[1:07:36] like what does that even mean? I I don't
[1:07:39] want it just to be like, you know, uh uh
[1:07:42] you know, you ask a question and there's
[1:07:44] a a textbook answer.
[1:07:47] You know, I've shared this before one
[1:07:48] time and Kaylee, you know, I believe she
[1:07:50] was only four years old and she was I I
[1:07:52] went to read her a book at night and she
[1:07:54] was reading every page. I'm like,
[1:07:55] "Praise God, my daughter's a genius."
[1:07:58] I'm like, "Hallelujah." I got the next
[1:08:00] book and she couldn't read a word. I'm
[1:08:01] like, "Wait a second. She just memorized
[1:08:04] it."
[1:08:06] You know, I was just flipping the page
[1:08:08] like, "Wow, she's bloop just reading
[1:08:10] right." I'm like, "My goodness, I can't
[1:08:12] believe she can read so well." And then
[1:08:15] I had a great revelation. Oh, she's just
[1:08:17] memorizing
[1:08:18] the pages.
[1:08:20] And then I said, "Aha, we do that as
[1:08:22] Christians,
[1:08:24] as believers.
[1:08:26] You can ask what's the what is the son
[1:08:29] of man or what's the seals and all this
[1:08:31] thing?" and we got memorized answers
[1:08:35] and we we we sound like we know what
[1:08:37] we're talking about. And I'll be the
[1:08:40] first one to say, I need I need
[1:08:41] revelation, man. If if if you ever put a
[1:08:45] check box on reveal the re revealing of
[1:08:46] the son of man. Got it. Yeah, I got that
[1:08:48] one in the bag. I mean, hold on here.
[1:08:51] You know, you can't you can't put an
[1:08:52] inexhaustible fountain in a bag and say
[1:08:56] check. Got that. No. And this is this
[1:08:58] message is spiritual food in due season.
[1:09:01] So you can listen to spiritual food in
[1:09:02] due season and it'll be food in every
[1:09:04] season of your life. And that goes for
[1:09:06] every sermon that was ever recorded. If
[1:09:08] you approach that word with faith, God
[1:09:10] will speak to you. 47 through 65. I
[1:09:13] don't care what it is. God will feed his
[1:09:16] sheep.
[1:09:19] And what we ought to be wanting is is is
[1:09:22] understanding and revelation. And here
[1:09:25] he's saying, I am the bread that cometh
[1:09:26] down. I unless you eat my flesh and
[1:09:28] drink my blood, you have no part in me.
[1:09:30] have no life in me. And brother Bandham
[1:09:32] says the disciples believed it, but they
[1:09:34] didn't understand it. But there would
[1:09:36] come a season for their understanding.
[1:09:40] That's right. You understand? Just like
[1:09:42] in in Revelations, it said John seal up
[1:09:45] those things. So through the church
[1:09:47] ages, the understanding, if I could say,
[1:09:49] are what those voices uttered, the it
[1:09:51] was sealed up. So then even even if you
[1:09:55] had the desire to know, you couldn't
[1:09:57] know those things. But I was saying if
[1:09:59] those things become available to know, I
[1:10:01] would want to know them. And there came
[1:10:03] a time where those disciples had to
[1:10:06] catch the revelation. And if I could try
[1:10:09] to say it so simple and and I love how
[1:10:12] our our our pastor pointed out this
[1:10:14] morning, he uh talking about the
[1:10:16] mechanics and the dynamics and talking
[1:10:18] about the recipe and he said, I almost
[1:10:21] wanted to title this, you know, uh uh
[1:10:23] eat the cake,
[1:10:25] right? Because I you can you can only
[1:10:28] you you can say repent of your sins and
[1:10:30] be baptized and be filled with the Holy
[1:10:31] Ghost and we can keep telling you the
[1:10:33] formula, but there comes a time where
[1:10:35] you got to put it into action where you
[1:10:37] actually got to repent of your sins. You
[1:10:39] got to work out your salvation with fear
[1:10:40] and trembling. You got to go down in the
[1:10:42] water. You got to come up and you got to
[1:10:44] let that quickening power come into your
[1:10:45] life. And then it has to start
[1:10:47] manifesting the fruits.
[1:10:50] A lot of us, we don't want to just cross
[1:10:52] over Jordan and say, "Praise God, I'm in
[1:10:54] the promised land.
[1:10:55] like man, yeah, you might be in the
[1:10:58] promised land, you know, you've heard it
[1:11:01] dramatized many times. I mean, could you
[1:11:03] imagine somebody finally been dreaming
[1:11:05] their whole life to go to Europe and
[1:11:08] like, man, I I I'm going to Rome. I'm
[1:11:11] going to Rome, Italy. And then two weeks
[1:11:13] later, like, hey, I heard you went to
[1:11:15] Rome. Like, yeah, how was it? Like, man,
[1:11:17] it was awesome. I I flew right into
[1:11:19] Rome. I I got out in terminal 4 and and
[1:11:22] I had me a Oh, I forget. A canoli with
[1:11:27] some espresso and then I flew out of
[1:11:29] terminal 3.
[1:11:32] Yeah, but how was Rome? Well, it was
[1:11:35] good. I had a canoli.
[1:11:37] I went to Italy. I went to Rome. Like,
[1:11:39] wait a second.
[1:11:41] I did. I really went. I'm like, yeah,
[1:11:43] well, I guess you kind of did, but you
[1:11:46] didn't.
[1:11:48] I mean, how many of us are are we coming
[1:11:50] into the word or or we we we get some
[1:11:53] maybe an idea or an understanding and
[1:11:55] then we just walk on. Okay, got that. If
[1:11:58] we would just stay there and meditate
[1:12:00] and pray on it, say, "Lord, reveal more
[1:12:02] to me. I want to know more about Psalms
[1:12:04] 27. I want to know more about that
[1:12:06] secret place, Lord. Lord, what do what
[1:12:08] do you mean when you say, "Eat my flesh
[1:12:09] and drink my blood. You have no part."
[1:12:11] Lord, I don't want that to just to be
[1:12:12] some concept or idea where, oh, yeah,
[1:12:14] it's the word and move on. Oh, there's
[1:12:16] such a deepness there. There's such a
[1:12:18] vastness and a richness to the word of
[1:12:20] God.
[1:12:24] And now in the day that we're living in,
[1:12:26] because that God has sent a prophet, I
[1:12:29] I'm going to wrap up real quick.
[1:12:32] Uh because God has sent a prophet and it
[1:12:36] was by Malachi 4:5,
[1:12:40] it was a renting of the veil.
[1:12:44] And what did it do? Just as in the days
[1:12:48] of Christ, he would he would talk about
[1:12:50] how the veil was rent from the top to
[1:12:52] the bottom, showing that it was God that
[1:12:54] done it. And it showed where was the
[1:12:56] true mercy seat. He said the mercy seat
[1:12:59] wasn't back there, but the mercy seat
[1:13:01] was hanging on Calvary. Do you realize,
[1:13:06] oh, that God has sent a prophet to rent
[1:13:08] the denominational veils and to show you
[1:13:11] God's not in denominations? He's not in
[1:13:14] the ways of man's. He's not dealing with
[1:13:16] man's thinking anymore. This isn't the
[1:13:18] age of man anymore. This is an eagle
[1:13:20] age. The veil has been ripped. Behold,
[1:13:23] look away to Jesus. Here he is in his
[1:13:26] word, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:28] forever. And what are you feeding on?
[1:13:30] You're feeding on the body word of the
[1:13:33] son of man. You're not feeding on the
[1:13:35] words of a man. His words will fail, but
[1:13:38] you're feeding on his word. And I could
[1:13:40] just say I I know we say those things so
[1:13:43] many times, but but I can say if you
[1:13:45] could just get curious enough to start
[1:13:47] digging into it.
[1:13:50] Say, Lord, give me the revelation of it.
[1:13:52] That when we reference Revelations 10
[1:13:54] 1-7, the mighty angel coming down. What?
[1:13:58] It was the promised word for the season
[1:14:00] that we're now living in. It was not
[1:14:03] available to any other age. They they
[1:14:06] were living in a in in the age of a
[1:14:08] partial truth and partial understanding
[1:14:11] and partial revelation a and they could
[1:14:14] only go so high. But God sent a prophet
[1:14:17] by uh by Malachi 4:5 and he took the
[1:14:20] limits off. There's no more limits for
[1:14:22] the believer. If you can believe for it,
[1:14:24] you can have it. You can have your
[1:14:26] healing. You can have your body changed.
[1:14:29] You can be in raptured condition right
[1:14:32] now.
[1:14:36] Take that, devil. I just asked the
[1:14:39] musicians to come. I'm We're going to be
[1:14:42] going to try to set a record.
[1:14:46] I And I I I won't have y'all sitting
[1:14:48] there more than four minutes before you
[1:14:49] start playing. Is that fair?
[1:14:52] We've only been 37 minutes.
[1:14:58] I I like how brother Brandy preaches
[1:15:00] that in in uh spiritual food and due
[1:15:02] season. He says, "Oh," he's typing out
[1:15:04] the famine and Elijah. And he says, "I'm
[1:15:06] going to type that." We could just go
[1:15:08] through all those things. I hope what we
[1:15:09] even say those things, you just get
[1:15:11] curious and go find out for yourself. I
[1:15:13] was sharing with the youth how sometimes
[1:15:15] we'll say things and it's it's like a
[1:15:17] building block.
[1:15:19] uh where what I just said is a is a
[1:15:23] sermon spiritual food in due season uh
[1:15:26] that could be preached on eons of times
[1:15:28] but if you can get the general concept
[1:15:29] of the revelation what the prophet was
[1:15:31] showing in there how Elijah come and
[1:15:33] said hey man it ain't going to rain
[1:15:35] there's going to be a famine in the land
[1:15:39] and because there was a famine God took
[1:15:40] Elijah said I got a secret place for you
[1:15:42] though while the whole world's in famine
[1:15:44] I'm you're going to be by the brook
[1:15:46] cherish and I'm going to feed you I'm
[1:15:47] going to feed you supernatural ings. He
[1:15:49] said, "I want to type that famine to the
[1:15:51] day that we're living in." And he says,
[1:15:53] "It's a fulfillment of Amos 8."
[1:15:57] Friends, we we are living in the hour
[1:16:00] where the believer can stand up and say,
[1:16:02] "This day, this scripture is fulfilled."
[1:16:06] That ought to give a boldness in the day
[1:16:08] of judgment where you can declare to
[1:16:10] your family, to your co-workers, and
[1:16:12] tell them, "Open up your Bible. You see
[1:16:14] Amos 8 right there. this day that you
[1:16:17] might look like a fanatic. You might be
[1:16:19] look like a lunatic, but I say when you
[1:16:21] catch a revelation of the word, you're
[1:16:23] always a fanatic and a lunatic to the
[1:16:25] word.
[1:16:28] And he's showing us that right now. He
[1:16:31] says, I want to type that famine to the
[1:16:32] day that Amos ate that it won't be a
[1:16:35] famine for bread, but a famine for
[1:16:37] hearing the word. They are outside of
[1:16:40] Malachi 4:5. It is death.
[1:16:44] I'm I'm sorry.
[1:16:48] And if you say, "Well, what about my
[1:16:50] brothers and what about my sisters?"
[1:16:51] You're their lifeline.
[1:16:55] I'm sorry. It's a closed book outside of
[1:16:59] Malachi 4:5.
[1:17:01] Closed book,
[1:17:03] veiled,
[1:17:06] blinded,
[1:17:08] but then Malachi 4:5 comes. Yes, sir. a
[1:17:12] son of man revealing the son of man.
[1:17:17] I I'm trying to remember. Uh yes, he pre
[1:17:20] I mean just what he preaches in the
[1:17:22] morning service. He preaches he preaches
[1:17:24] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:17:26] light because it's total darkness, total
[1:17:29] chaos. You can't see anything. Well, and
[1:17:32] he got that whole inspiration because
[1:17:34] here's that little sister. Mama, it's
[1:17:36] dark. I can't see. How do I go in a
[1:17:39] rapture? How do I go on a body change?
[1:17:41] How do I get born again? How do I get
[1:17:44] quickening power? I screamed. I shouted.
[1:17:46] I danced, but I got no no overcoming
[1:17:49] life. I speak in tongues. I got no
[1:17:51] overcoming life. I wear long skirts. I
[1:17:54] scream. I shout. I run around the
[1:17:56] church, but I know more than a conqueror
[1:17:58] is than my other Pentecostal brothers.
[1:18:00] Why? Because there's no overcoming life.
[1:18:02] Total chaos and darkness. Now, now I'll
[1:18:05] just lay this in there. there was truly
[1:18:07] godfilled uh brothers and sisters that
[1:18:10] lived in the age of the true
[1:18:12] dispensation of Pentecost back to those
[1:18:15] days. So don't ever disparage our
[1:18:17] brothers and sisters who got in a
[1:18:19] yearning and a calling and they sensed
[1:18:21] in their spirit. Something was calling
[1:18:23] and they got in an anguish and an agony
[1:18:26] for the supernatural and God poured out
[1:18:27] his spirit upon all flesh.
[1:18:30] Don't forget every revival has twins. So
[1:18:33] in that revival, there was a genuine and
[1:18:36] there was a false. Don't let the
[1:18:37] scarecrows make you diminish your
[1:18:39] brothers of it. They they had something.
[1:18:41] Some of us don't even got a real
[1:18:43] sincerity and ability to get on their
[1:18:45] knees and call on God and see the
[1:18:46] supernatural.
[1:18:50] But as it as the life moved on out, if I
[1:18:53] could say as the as the word seed was
[1:18:57] made flesh in the husk and I believe
[1:18:59] that was the word was made flesh in
[1:19:01] Malachi 4:5 which was the the son of man
[1:19:04] ministry made flesh. It was in the husk
[1:19:07] and the husk excommunicated the word out
[1:19:10] of the church ages and Christ was on the
[1:19:12] outside of the church ages.
[1:19:15] And the life could never get back into
[1:19:17] the shock in those denominations
[1:19:19] anymore.
[1:19:21] And so now what is he having to declare?
[1:19:23] Come out of her people. And so now the
[1:19:27] whole church world and everybody's
[1:19:28] groping in darkness. Pentecostalism,
[1:19:31] Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, every
[1:19:33] single one. They're groping in darkness.
[1:19:35] They're crying and if there was a
[1:19:36] sincere sister or or daughter or girl
[1:19:40] which is a representation of the church
[1:19:43] crying out say I can't see there was a
[1:19:46] brother standing by.
[1:19:50] Thank you brother Brandham. There was a
[1:19:52] brother standing by said fear not
[1:19:55] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:19:57] light. And what did the prophet preach
[1:20:00] that evening?
[1:20:03] Look away to Jesus.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. Because of Malachi 4:5, he
[1:20:09] come and he ripped the veil and said,
[1:20:12] "Look away to Christ. Look away to the
[1:20:15] word." And I did it again. I'm sorry.
[1:20:17] I get to preaching.
[1:20:20] And uh I leave y'all sitting up there.
[1:20:22] You forgive me. Um I'll read this last
[1:20:25] quote.
[1:20:28] The prophet of God says,
[1:20:30] "I know they they have a lot of great
[1:20:32] they've known me a long time, so they
[1:20:34] they have a lot of grace for me. They
[1:20:36] just look at me and say, "Oh, poor
[1:20:37] little brother Matthew. They knew me
[1:20:40] when I was little, so they just have
[1:20:41] grace for me. So, thank you. Thanks for
[1:20:44] thanks for your grace." I'll just move
[1:20:46] through this quote real quickly and then
[1:20:47] we'll we'll close. It is the rising of
[1:20:50] the sun. If the spirit that raised him
[1:20:52] from the dead,
[1:20:54] the word, the dynamic of the word dwells
[1:20:56] in you, it also quickens your mortal
[1:20:58] body. Now, now how we flesh of his flesh
[1:21:02] and bone of his bone because quickly
[1:21:05] while we were yet mortal sinners,
[1:21:06] mortal, ready to die, these bodies, it
[1:21:09] quickens that body. What's quickened
[1:21:11] brings to life. The spirit that once
[1:21:14] like to drink, run around, commit
[1:21:16] adultery and all these, it's quickened.
[1:21:19] Why? The thing died and you are
[1:21:21] resurrected.
[1:21:23] It quickens your mortal body. I I love
[1:21:25] our pastor's title. That was awesome.
[1:21:27] Resurrection before rapture. Look, you
[1:21:29] ain't going in a rapture if you haven't
[1:21:30] been resurrected. Amen.
[1:21:33] Therefore, your bodies is the temple of
[1:21:35] the dynamics. Because why? From the
[1:21:37] beginning, you are part of the
[1:21:38] mechanics. Oh, there is your
[1:21:40] resurrection. There is the church and
[1:21:42] the resurrection with him. These bodies
[1:21:44] right now are quickened. See, you've
[1:21:47] heard, you believe. It changed you from
[1:21:50] a denomination to the word. See
[1:21:53] the the dynamics. If it comes upon
[1:21:56] water, it just sputters. Days of
[1:21:57] miracles are passed. Pump, pump, pump,
[1:21:59] pump. Oh, I believe the Bible. Pump,
[1:22:00] pump, pump, pump. There you are. There
[1:22:02] ain't no pump, pump, pump. See, it just
[1:22:04] sputters. But when he hits that 1,000
[1:22:07] octane whirl, away she goes. You see how
[1:22:10] my the dynamic strike that? But it if it
[1:22:13] strikes a chicken, it won't do no good.
[1:22:15] But when it strikes the eagle, he moves
[1:22:17] out. Start moving out, eagles. Amen. The
[1:22:21] dynamics with the mechanics. See what I
[1:22:23] mean? That is if he is a true eagle now,
[1:22:25] he will understand. Now, I I I don't
[1:22:27] have time to preach this, but I'm going
[1:22:28] to lay this in there,
[1:22:31] church.
[1:22:33] We have to stop being on the defense.
[1:22:37] So many times we we we're Satan's able
[1:22:39] to get us where we're trying. We feel
[1:22:41] like and if you could catch a revelation
[1:22:43] of justification,
[1:22:45] move on. You make a mistake, move. Lord,
[1:22:47] forgive me. I'm going on with God.
[1:22:49] Because Satan wants to keep trying to
[1:22:50] make you go in circles and we're always
[1:22:52] feeling unworthy, feeling not good
[1:22:54] enough. I can't do this. And if you're
[1:22:56] always trying to clean up your life and
[1:22:59] clean up your room, you'll never be like
[1:23:01] Abraham who said, "They took who?" You
[1:23:04] mean they took Lot? You mean there's
[1:23:07] thousands of them and seven kings or
[1:23:08] three kings? I don't care what how many
[1:23:10] or whatever. I am a son of God. And and
[1:23:14] I was going to go on to where the Bible
[1:23:16] says we have the shield of faith which
[1:23:18] what quips is every fiery dart of the
[1:23:20] enemy. When he tells you you're no good
[1:23:22] and you're a loser and you're not going
[1:23:23] to go in the rapture, you got to raise
[1:23:25] up the word which said you never did it
[1:23:28] in the first. Friends, we got to start
[1:23:30] lifting up the message and quenching
[1:23:32] every fire regard in it. When he says
[1:23:34] you're not going to go in a rapture,
[1:23:36] raise it up and say
[1:23:39] wedding band of predestination.
[1:23:41] Already made it. When he tries to tell
[1:23:44] you, well, your mistakes of yesterday,
[1:23:46] you're not going to go in a rapture. I'm
[1:23:48] already in a rapture condition and you
[1:23:50] quench the fiery darts of the enemy, but
[1:23:53] what this word is also a sword. And then
[1:23:56] how can I overcome? He's saying you got
[1:23:59] to take that word and whack the devil.
[1:24:02] And if he doesn't move, what do you do?
[1:24:05] Whack him again. It's time, church. We
[1:24:08] get on the offensive and stop. Oh my
[1:24:11] goodness. Am I going to make it? Am I Am
[1:24:13] I going in a rapture? Can I be healed?
[1:24:15] Oh. Oh no. I'm going to be sick again.
[1:24:17] Am I going to get my kids back? Hey,
[1:24:19] what am I going to It's time to lift up
[1:24:21] the banner of the message of the hour.
[1:24:23] Say, I'm going to get my sons. I'm going
[1:24:26] to get my daughters. If you're sick, I'm
[1:24:28] coming to pray for you. You mean your
[1:24:30] but your sons out in the world? Let's go
[1:24:32] get them with prayer. It's time, church.
[1:24:35] We go on the offensive like Abraham. Go
[1:24:38] get Lot. Go get your prodals. Go get
[1:24:41] your healing. Go get your salvation. Go
[1:24:44] get the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:24:48] all stand.
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:57] We are not a dead church. Yes, sir.
[1:25:06] Saints, I I believe, if you allow me, I
[1:25:11] believe our pastor's heart, what he's
[1:25:12] wanting to say is,
[1:25:16] look, when the word was made flesh,
[1:25:22] we do have a baptism. So, we'll uh we'll
[1:25:26] call for you shortly.
[1:25:30] When the word was made flesh in Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ,
[1:25:35] he came to lay down his life for others.
[1:25:40] When the the word was made flesh
[1:25:42] according to divine promise in the
[1:25:45] prophet of the age which was a first one
[1:25:47] to maturity
[1:25:49] that was a life lived for others.
[1:25:52] Right?
[1:25:55] And if that same spirit
[1:25:58] that raised up Jesus Christ from the
[1:26:00] dead dwell in you, it will quicken your
[1:26:03] mortal bodies. Quit being selfish.
[1:26:07] It doesn't quicken your mortal body so
[1:26:09] you can say, "Look at me. Look at me.
[1:26:12] I'm original life. Aren't I pre?" No, it
[1:26:16] quickens your mortal body. So now you
[1:26:19] can be a fountain of living water
[1:26:22] bellowing out and say, "The spirit and
[1:26:25] the bride say, "Come. He that is
[1:26:28] thirsty, come and drink. If you're
[1:26:30] hungry, come and eat."
[1:26:33] Now that's real lives. And I believe
[1:26:37] some of us, if you need to repent, look,
[1:26:40] all you have to do is identify with the
[1:26:42] sacrifice.
[1:26:44] Lord, I'm truly sorry.
[1:26:48] I don't want to do it anymore.
[1:26:51] Plead the blood. We're not Catholics.
[1:26:53] You don't have to do penance.
[1:26:56] If you sow to the flesh, you do you.
[1:26:58] There might be a few things you got to
[1:26:59] make right, but don't let the devil beat
[1:27:01] you up. Say, "Lord, it's in your hands.
[1:27:02] All things work together to the good
[1:27:04] that to them that are called according
[1:27:05] to the purpose.
[1:27:07] Right? You identify with that. And now
[1:27:09] let's go forward.
[1:27:12] Let this mind be in you which was also
[1:27:14] in Christ Jesus.
[1:27:16] How can we ever have faith for a body
[1:27:19] change
[1:27:20] if we're lacking faith for our
[1:27:22] justification?
[1:27:25] Look friends, Enoch was not walking and
[1:27:29] wondering if I'm in or out.
[1:27:33] Oh, he he was walking with the provider.
[1:27:36] We're walking with the provider, church.
[1:27:38] All those other things are beneath you.
[1:27:40] Set your affections on things above.
[1:27:42] Let's start praying for one another.
[1:27:44] Let's start if if you see a brother,
[1:27:46] sister, and their their children are out
[1:27:47] in the world. Oh, I could preach right
[1:27:50] now out of Why Christ speaks. Sorry, I'm
[1:27:52] doing it again. But after Moses plagued
[1:27:56] Pharaoh, Pharaoh finally had enough.
[1:27:59] Pharaoh said, "I'll make a deal with
[1:28:00] you. just just go out for 3 days, you
[1:28:02] men, and come back. Pharaoh said, "I
[1:28:04] ain't leaving, and I ain't leaving a
[1:28:05] hoof behind."
[1:28:09] And he said, "Oh, I'd like to preach on
[1:28:10] this if God would give me a chance." He
[1:28:12] said, he said, "Moses plagued Pharaoh
[1:28:15] with thus sayith the Lord." Plagued
[1:28:18] Pharaoh with the words of Moses. Bride,
[1:28:20] we got thus sayith the Lord. Let's start
[1:28:21] plaguing the devil with it and say, "I'm
[1:28:24] not leaving a hoof behind." What are we
[1:28:25] singing?
[1:28:28] Let's just sing this if that those that
[1:28:30] are uh preparing for baptism, if you can
[1:28:33] go. Uh, brother Billy, if you can come
[1:28:35] help us, we'll go baptize. And uh, sorry
[1:28:38] to keep you longer than we wanted. God
[1:28:39] bless you.
[1:28:41] [Music]
[1:28:45] He became sin,
[1:28:48] burdened, no sin. Oh, that we might be
[1:28:58] with that he humbled himself.

[1:37:26] Amen.
[1:37:28] wonderful opportunity to baptize once in
[1:37:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:37:34] And then I would also just invite
[1:37:36] anybody who feels the call of God in
[1:37:39] your life that God is wanting you to set
[1:37:43] your affections on things above and
[1:37:45] you're tired of the the world and the
[1:37:47] things of the world. You want to repent.
[1:37:50] Exactly what the scripture said as on
[1:37:53] the day of Pentecost when Peter opened
[1:37:55] up his mouth and declared those words
[1:37:57] and he said in Acts 2:37 he says now
[1:38:00] when they he said um verse 36 therefore
[1:38:04] let all the house of Israel know
[1:38:05] assuredly that the God hath made that
[1:38:07] same Jesus whom you crucified both Lord
[1:38:11] and Christ. Amen. And when they heard
[1:38:13] this, they were pricricked in their
[1:38:15] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[1:38:18] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[1:38:21] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[1:38:25] them, "Repent, and be baptized, every
[1:38:27] one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:38:31] for the remission of sins, and ye shall
[1:38:33] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[1:38:36] this promise is unto you and to your
[1:38:39] children and to all them that are a far
[1:38:43] off. You know, Brother Brandham said the
[1:38:45] aar off was the Gentiles.
[1:38:48] Praise God.
[1:38:50] Even as many as the Lord God shall call
[1:38:56] and God has called our brother to water
[1:38:57] baptism and to have that quickening
[1:38:59] power. And I just, brother, if there's a
[1:39:02] word of testimony you'd want to give.
[1:39:04] Um, I just want to thank God for the
[1:39:07] opportunity to speak again to my heart
[1:39:11] this afternoon and convinced me to come
[1:39:14] here and do this. I also I'm very
[1:39:17] grateful of this church. I'm grateful of
[1:39:20] the pastor. He's been a great great
[1:39:23] improvement in my spiritual life and I
[1:39:26] really thank God for that. And I would
[1:39:28] like to seal this with my bapt. Amen.
[1:39:31] Praise the Lord. Since there's just one
[1:39:33] of us, I'm gonna I'm gonna have you go
[1:39:35] to my right side if you stand over here.
[1:39:38] Amen. Hallelujah.

[1:39:43] commission to go in all the world,

[1:39:52] was on that day say baptize them in the
[1:39:55] name of Jesus Christ. Brother Alance

[1:40:47] grave. I was called by him. Born in a
[1:40:53] race back to life.

[1:43:02] was only.

[1:43:37] Oh, and born and raised back to life.

[1:45:33] Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] Would you tell me if I could just come
[1:45:36] in this place?
[1:45:40] Let's
[1:45:42] [Music]
[1:45:47] bow our heads. Our gracious Lord, we
[1:45:50] thank you for this time we've had
[1:45:52] together tonight, Lord.
[1:45:54] Lord, truly the revealing of your word,
[1:45:57] Lord. It's a process.
[1:46:00] It's an event Lord that has taken place
[1:46:03] in this dispensation
[1:46:08] as our brother so eloquently brought
[1:46:10] Lord that it's the son of man. Yes
[1:46:14] Lord being made alive to us
[1:46:17] but Lord it just like the rain that
[1:46:20] falls on the ground Lord it has to soak
[1:46:23] in.
[1:46:24] It has to water and continue to water.
[1:46:27] Lord, we pray that that can be the case
[1:46:29] tonight, Lord. The things that we've
[1:46:30] heard, Lord, they can continue to soak
[1:46:33] in. Lord, we realize there's a time for
[1:46:36] enduring,
[1:46:38] Lord. Truly, we have seasons in our
[1:46:40] life. We go through things. There's also
[1:46:43] a time of overcoming.
[1:46:45] So, Lord, we we want those things that
[1:46:47] he spoke about, Lord, to be underneath
[1:46:49] us, below our feet. You said every devil
[1:46:51] in hell. Lord, it doesn't matter where
[1:46:55] we find ourselves, part of the body of
[1:46:57] Christ.
[1:46:59] Your prophet said we could be the souls
[1:47:02] of his feet, the skin on the souls of
[1:47:05] his feet, and every devil in hell is
[1:47:07] beneath us.
[1:47:09] Give us that awareness, Lord, the
[1:47:12] overcoming power.
[1:47:15] Lord, as you said, we can lift up your
[1:47:17] word. We can claim the promises. we can
[1:47:19] have faith and believe that it's not us
[1:47:22] that's overcoming, Lord, at you and your
[1:47:24] word. So grant it to us tonight, Lord.
[1:47:26] We thank you for having been in this
[1:47:28] service. Lord, may we all be drawn
[1:47:30] closer to you. We thank you for the soul
[1:47:32] that's been added to the kingdom
[1:47:33] tonight, Lord. Lord, maybe he's the last
[1:47:36] one. We don't know, but we're looking
[1:47:38] forward, as our brother said, for a body
[1:47:40] change and a soon catching away. Be with
[1:47:44] us this week, Lord. Give us strength, we
[1:47:45] pray, Lord, that we can remember these
[1:47:49] requests, the needs put before us, Lord.
[1:47:53] Even the things that are on our own
[1:47:54] hearts, Lord, we just continue to ask
[1:47:56] and believe for them. Bless this
[1:47:58] fellowship we're about to go into, Lord.
[1:48:00] The the function of a of a church, Lord,
[1:48:03] is truly a benevolence and a taking care
[1:48:07] of the congregation. We thank you for
[1:48:09] this, Lord. Lord, just bless our
[1:48:11] fellowship and the food or the ice
[1:48:13] cream, whatever it may be, Lord. We can
[1:48:14] do it all in the right spirit. Go with
[1:48:17] us now. We ask this in the lovely name
[1:48:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:48:24] Amen. Amen. God bless you at this midst.
[1:48:27] Why don't we sing that song? Can't you
[1:48:29] see why I'm so happy? Amen. I believe we
[1:48:33] have to be the most happiest person
[1:48:35] there is on the planet. Amen. Oh, can't
[1:48:38] you see
[1:48:40] [Music]
[1:48:41] why
[1:48:43] I'm so happy?
[1:48:47] Oh, I accepted
[1:48:51] the word
[1:48:54] of the Lord.
[1:48:58] Oh,
[1:49:05] I was for
[1:49:11] [Music]
[1:49:15] a

[1:49:23] [Applause]
[1:49:24] why
[1:49:26] I'm so
[1:49:27] [Music]
[1:49:32] I accepted
[1:49:35] the wordhood
[1:49:37] of the Lord.
[1:49:41] Oh,
[1:49:47] the word I was born.
[1:49:50] Oh.
[1:49:52] Oh. Am I a prophet
[1:49:56] of my
[1:49:59] life?
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:33] Hallelujah.
[1:50:41] [Music]
