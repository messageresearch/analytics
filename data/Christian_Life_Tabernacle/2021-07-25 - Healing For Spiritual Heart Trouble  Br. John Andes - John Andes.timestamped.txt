[11:06] we heard this past wednesday of a sermon
[11:08] entitled
[11:09] a faith-inspired attitude father i
[11:11] believe god that the saints of god have
[11:13] a certain attitude when they come to
[11:14] church
[11:15] a certain mindset that this should be
[11:17] coming with and is to leave everything
[11:18] goes on in the world at the door
[11:20] and come here with the heart fully open
[11:22] to receive something from you
[11:23] father we understand it's by the
[11:25] preaching of the word that healing comes
[11:27] forth lord jesus
[11:28] so we surrender our all to you every
[11:30] problem that we have everything that's
[11:32] going on in our lives

[49:35] got exactly what she got i said good job
[49:37] zoe you know
[49:39] sometimes we need to talk to our young
[49:40] people
[49:42] hallelujah so if i collapse tonight
[49:45] zoe
[49:45] [Laughter]
[49:49] you're gonna have to stand and sing amen
[49:52] i'll give one more testimony
[49:54] there was a brother where i was with
[49:56] this afternoon too
[49:57] and and just as i was getting into the
[49:59] car
[50:00] he gave me a testimony
[50:04] of a lady he was close to that was born
[50:07] with a hole in her heart
[50:09] and they didn't know that until age four
[50:12] i believe they found it they found the
[50:15] hole in her heart and they stitched it
[50:17] up
[50:18] and it wasn't until her 50s i believe it
[50:21] was
[50:22] i'm just trying to relate it as we were
[50:23] standing at the door
[50:25] it wasn't until she was in her 50s that
[50:28] it almost killed her because they found
[50:30] that the scars
[50:33] that had been on her heart
[50:36] was causing her trouble and they had to
[50:38] go in
[50:40] and do another heart surgery and they
[50:42] put in a pacemaker
[50:44] i believe a heart defibrillator i
[50:46] believe
[50:47] and her heart is now connected to her
[50:51] cell phone
[50:52] which is then connected to the doctor
[50:54] and the doctor the hospital
[50:56] and every so often they have to do
[50:59] checkups and
[51:00] updates and tune-ups and and the man
[51:04] said um
[51:04] about this lady that she can feel that
[51:08] she can feel that in her heart and i was
[51:11] thinking spiritually because that's what
[51:13] we spoke on this morning and tonight
[51:15] lord if you have to take out our heart
[51:18] and do some work on it tonight
[51:20] you might feel it but it's for your good
[51:25] and so you might have been born with an
[51:27] issue maybe they didn't find it until
[51:29] later and then
[51:30] maybe there are scars in your heart
[51:32] maybe there's things issues
[51:34] and matters a situations and even if
[51:37] as you get older it has to be dealt with
[51:39] again
[51:41] it's okay god's got everything under
[51:44] control
[51:45] so let's stand and turn to ezekiel
[51:46] tonight um
[51:48] ezekiel chapter 11 thank you musicians
[51:51] and i don't mean to take so much of your
[51:53] time

[52:01] have air conditioning i mean

[52:06] the other half must be turning to the
[52:08] scripture amen
[52:09] because i'm glad we have air
[52:11] conditioning hallelujah
[52:14] if we didn't have that probably half of
[52:16] us would already been

[57:37] then will i sprinkle clean water upon
[57:41] you

[57:46] your filthiness well i thought it was
[57:50] just
[57:50] those certain things or those some
[57:53] things
[57:54] the bible doesn't say some of your
[57:56] filthiness
[57:57] it says all your filthiness
[58:00] and from all your idols
[58:03] will i cleanse you so
[58:06] it's not the church or the preacher or
[58:08] the pope
[58:10] it's not the nurse or the doctor god's
[58:13] cleansing us
[58:14] he sent his word and healed them okay
[58:18] now vote
[58:18] notice verse 26 our last two verses here

[58:26] also will i give you
[58:29] and a new spirit
[58:33] will i put within you
[58:38] and i will take away the stony heart out
[58:41] of your flesh
[58:44] and i will give you a heart of flesh
[58:48] well that'd be wonderful wouldn't it to
[58:50] be in a church where people had new
[58:52] hearts new spirits
[58:54] stoniness was leaving grudges was
[58:56] leaving bad
[58:57] talking nasty lying was leaving and god
[59:00] was giving us his heart
[59:02] his spirit now verse 26 is a new heart
[59:05] will i give you in a new spirit but we
[59:07] have to have verse 27
[59:10] this is justification sanctification
[59:13] now god's spirit i will put
[59:16] my spirit within you
[59:20] when he talked about in verse 26 if you
[59:22] want to put it back to
[59:23] 26 when it says a new spirit will i give
[59:26] you brother branham said
[59:28] he gave you a new spirit to put up with
[59:30] your own
[59:31] to put up i mean how can you even deal
[59:33] with one another
[59:34] without the right spirit but you still
[59:36] got to go further
[59:38] verse 27 is the going further i will put
[59:42] my spirit within you and cause you to
[59:45] walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my
[59:48] judgments and do them
[59:49] it's thus saith the lord god bless you
[59:52] can have your seats and
[59:53] i think there's room in the sanctuary
[59:55] for anyone that might be
[59:57] in the overflow and want to come on in
[1:00:00] amen we got some room tonight
[1:00:02] praise god back in may we were all
[1:00:04] packed out and full and out in the cars
[1:00:06] and everything and
[1:00:08] now you can breathe a little bit
[1:00:10] hallelujah breathe a little bit
[1:00:12] it's just the home folks just the home
[1:00:15] folks tonight
[1:00:17] healing for spiritual heart trouble
[1:00:22] now tonight we're going to focus on
[1:00:25] healing
[1:00:27] if that's okay god heals
[1:00:31] i mentioned this this morning but in
[1:00:33] 1963
[1:00:34] in in arkansas brother branham said god
[1:00:37] heals in many ways
[1:00:38] a doctor asked me not long ago what's
[1:00:41] your opinion
[1:00:42] of medicine brother branham i said well
[1:00:44] god is the only one that can heal
[1:00:46] sir i said the bible don't lie
[1:00:50] and the bible said i am the lord that
[1:00:52] heals all
[1:00:53] your diseases and the bible can't lie
[1:00:58] god heals he goes immediately and said
[1:01:02] god heals by medicine
[1:01:06] god heals by love god
[1:01:09] heals by understanding god
[1:01:12] heals by care god heals
[1:01:16] by prayer god heals by miracles
[1:01:20] the whole thing he said god heals that's
[1:01:22] all there is he
[1:01:24] is the healer medicine can't create
[1:01:28] can't create a cells in your hand and in
[1:01:31] your body to heal we can move a tooth
[1:01:34] we can cut out an appendix or take out a
[1:01:37] gallbladder
[1:01:38] but who heals who heals tonight
[1:01:42] let's have a little bit of back and
[1:01:44] forth here who heals
[1:01:48] see medicine can't build tissue
[1:01:53] only god can do that life
[1:01:56] builds tissue god is the only healer
[1:02:00] and he said and we were talking on that
[1:02:02] so we were talking on that this morning
[1:02:04] i'm talking on it tonight about god
[1:02:06] healing but we're going to some
[1:02:08] spiritual heart troubles
[1:02:10] because when brother branham was
[1:02:12] speaking about god heals and i know all
[1:02:14] of you believe that
[1:02:15] but he talked about god heals by
[1:02:17] medicine god healing by love
[1:02:20] healing by prayer and by miracles and by
[1:02:23] said understanding but he said
[1:02:25] god heals by care
[1:02:28] now that might not mean very much to you
[1:02:31] until you get in a situation and you
[1:02:34] don't feel care
[1:02:35] you don't kill feel cared for it just
[1:02:38] seems like
[1:02:39] we're so busy today we don't have time
[1:02:42] to give uh people attention
[1:02:46] amen but do you know god cares
[1:02:49] and he heals by care that so
[1:02:52] struck me and it struck brother branham
[1:02:55] that
[1:02:55] three weeks later he left arkansas and
[1:02:58] went back to jeffersonville
[1:03:00] and preached a whole message on he cares
[1:03:03] do you now i want to show you tonight
[1:03:07] how god heals it's
[1:03:08] it's not always in the same way i'm
[1:03:12] trying to
[1:03:12] nice to have you back brother cosman
[1:03:14] amen and amen are in the back
[1:03:16] hallelujah you missed this morning so
[1:03:18] make up for it tonight amen
[1:03:21] i got you you know
[1:03:25] when brother branham was dealing with
[1:03:26] the conditions of the heart he
[1:03:28] had a lot of divine healing services is
[1:03:31] that right
[1:03:32] divine healing services there was a lot
[1:03:35] of
[1:03:36] laying on of hands and the very gift
[1:03:38] that god used of him
[1:03:40] taking the person by the hand and
[1:03:42] knowing the secrets of the heart was
[1:03:45] to bring the person to healing it wasn't
[1:03:48] a show-off
[1:03:50] and the very thing of brother branham
[1:03:52] knowing a person's name
[1:03:54] and you had and you're an address back
[1:03:56] there and what you were doing this
[1:03:57] afternoon
[1:03:58] you know at 3 38 god knows all about
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:03] and you say wow 338 where was oh god
[1:04:06] knew
[1:04:06] he knows me that was a gift that was
[1:04:08] operating
[1:04:10] to bring the people to know that god
[1:04:12] cares for you
[1:04:13] cares enough about your need to say your
[1:04:15] name and what you were going through
[1:04:17] this afternoon or
[1:04:18] yesterday to get you to a healing
[1:04:23] not for us to say oh brother branham
[1:04:25] brother branham brother branham brother
[1:04:26] branham
[1:04:27] we're not branhamites we're sons and
[1:04:29] daughters of god
[1:04:32] is that okay i hope i didn't embarrass
[1:04:34] or offend anyone there
[1:04:36] the whole thing about prayer lines and
[1:04:39] put your need on
[1:04:40] a card and things and coming before
[1:04:41] brother branham time
[1:04:43] after time after time an anointing with
[1:04:45] oil and i
[1:04:46] see oil is up here tonight and we anoint
[1:04:49] with oil and laying hands on the sick
[1:04:51] that is for a person to be healed but
[1:04:54] the virtue
[1:04:56] isn't in the oil it's in your faith
[1:05:00] in god god heals
[1:05:04] so now brother branham is under the
[1:05:06] impact of this god cares
[1:05:08] god heals by caring and by understanding
[1:05:12] and by love and
[1:05:13] it wasn't just like a passing filler
[1:05:15] thought
[1:05:17] he comes back to jeffersonville and
[1:05:19] preaches he cares to you care and said
[1:05:22] i hope that each one of you get that
[1:05:24] especially you people that's to be
[1:05:26] prayed for
[1:05:27] that's so uncomfortable this morning
[1:05:30] with maybe troubles that doctors cannot
[1:05:33] touch
[1:05:35] say anyone with no need of a physician
[1:05:39] can just wave at the doctor how you
[1:05:41] doing all's good
[1:05:43] good all's good but if you're sitting
[1:05:46] there uncomfortable
[1:05:48] and you have trouble and you have a need
[1:05:51] that's when you want to flag down a
[1:05:53] doctor 9-1-1
[1:05:55] call the doctor do you we've got to deal
[1:05:58] with this
[1:05:59] issue then you know it's so um evident
[1:06:02] when it's a need on the outside
[1:06:05] broken leg flipped over car you know a
[1:06:08] gash in the head
[1:06:09] it's so obvious you're not walking right
[1:06:14] but when it's a heart trouble you could
[1:06:17] actually be as we said this morning 99
[1:06:20] with a blockage and not even know it
[1:06:24] are we all together you could have a
[1:06:26] spiritual issue going on
[1:06:28] and it's so well hidden that's why the
[1:06:31] gifts of god
[1:06:32] has got to go a lot deeper than emotion
[1:06:35] a whole lot deeper than storytelling
[1:06:38] and fantastics and 20-minute sermons
[1:06:42] tell the people how good they are
[1:06:44] thank you for your tithes and offerings
[1:06:46] we'll see you next sunday
[1:06:49] it's got to go deeper than that if not
[1:06:51] we become another
[1:06:53] church and another denomination and
[1:06:56] people get older in the message and get
[1:06:58] spiritual dementia
[1:07:01] spiritual alzheimer's where they are
[1:07:04] literally losing their mind
[1:07:08] they have lost their way they don't know
[1:07:11] how to think they don't know how to make
[1:07:12] decisions they don't know how to
[1:07:14] walk in life they don't know how to have
[1:07:16] leadership and
[1:07:17] pretty soon it gets to a place where the
[1:07:19] holy spirit is no longer the leader of
[1:07:21] the church
[1:07:22] no more it's politics it's friendships
[1:07:26] it's feelings we just become a clique
[1:07:28] and a
[1:07:29] cliche and well that's where we go to
[1:07:31] church brother john and
[1:07:33] man's ideas we share if we agree we
[1:07:35] rejoice we say man if not then
[1:07:37] we kind of get a little like this and
[1:07:39] people do what they want to do
[1:07:41] people live how they want to be that's
[1:07:43] the church
[1:07:44] but the bride lives different than that
[1:07:48] hallelujah i believe the lord is
[1:07:51] interested in your life
[1:07:53] when he puts his finger on the need and
[1:07:56] he puts his
[1:07:57] finger on the real problem and starts
[1:07:59] talking about the trouble
[1:08:01] people don't want to admit they have
[1:08:02] trouble today people want to put up a
[1:08:05] front and make it looks like you know we
[1:08:07] got it all together as
[1:08:08] mommy daddy brother sister
[1:08:11] and we're just all walking like
[1:08:13] ducklings across the road and things and
[1:08:15] they just want to
[1:08:16] put up this all's good and then things
[1:08:18] grow up and people grow up and things
[1:08:20] begin to change
[1:08:22] and they begin to realize there's deep
[1:08:24] needs
[1:08:25] there's trouble and it turns into chaos
[1:08:28] and it turns into breakages and
[1:08:30] breakings uh of homes and breakings of
[1:08:34] churches and i'll get into that a little
[1:08:36] bit later it's a lack of love
[1:08:39] the reason why people have such lack of
[1:08:42] desperation today
[1:08:44] is a lack of love i've seen it over the
[1:08:46] last 16 months in the message
[1:08:49] this whole pandemic satan has achieved a
[1:08:52] lot of what was in his mind
[1:08:54] by causing a serious diversion
[1:08:58] people's attention on the numbers and
[1:09:00] get their attention on the news and
[1:09:02] you know what's the cases and what's the
[1:09:04] you wear a mask or you got a distance
[1:09:06] you got a channel
[1:09:06] and they get their mind to people's
[1:09:08] minds all stirred up before pretty soon
[1:09:10] you look back over
[1:09:11] what's happened in your life and you
[1:09:13] realize you're looking more at the news
[1:09:14] than you are the word of god
[1:09:16] you're more concerned about your health
[1:09:18] than you are your spiritual health and
[1:09:20] the whole focus shifts do you know
[1:09:22] what's happened
[1:09:23] the devil has achieved his plan
[1:09:26] and it's not a local issue what brother
[1:09:28] john dealt with this morning
[1:09:30] and tonight is not a glo it's not a
[1:09:32] local issue it's a global issue
[1:09:35] serious heart trouble
[1:09:38] spiritual amnesia has struck and
[1:09:42] a person can be going along on the train
[1:09:44] and be a soldier and
[1:09:46] you know go through the motions and be
[1:09:48] totally out of their place
[1:09:50] i pray that god would show us that that
[1:09:52] place
[1:09:53] in the word and show us our place in
[1:09:55] christ
[1:09:56] and it might shake you just a little bit
[1:10:00] i got to say some things
[1:10:04] people don't want to admit when they got
[1:10:06] trouble
[1:10:08] well i'm not going to go to the doctor
[1:10:10] and i'm not going to go to the nurse and
[1:10:11] i'm not going to take this pill
[1:10:14] god heals god heals and i'm not gonna
[1:10:17] take no medicine and i'm not gonna
[1:10:19] take this and that and if we're not
[1:10:21] careful
[1:10:22] we're actually going against what a
[1:10:24] prophet taught
[1:10:26] god heals by medicine so brother branham
[1:10:29] comes back to jeffersonville's home
[1:10:31] church where he felt comfortable and
[1:10:32] start speaking about people that were in
[1:10:34] the service that were
[1:10:36] uncomfortable and had troubles that
[1:10:38] doctors cannot touch and he says
[1:10:40] we believe doctors help people he said i
[1:10:43] believe that
[1:10:44] god heals by medicine
[1:10:48] god heals by surgery
[1:10:51] god heals by understanding this is
[1:10:54] another service
[1:10:57] god heals by love just a little love
[1:11:00] goes a long way
[1:11:03] he said let somebody be all upset and
[1:11:05] just show them
[1:11:06] that you care for them
[1:11:09] god heals by love you know i experienced
[1:11:12] that this last week you know you can be
[1:11:14] in a situation
[1:11:16] approaching something you really don't
[1:11:17] know what to do about it just
[1:11:19] have a little patience be sensitive
[1:11:23] make yourself available just in the back
[1:11:26] part of your heart say
[1:11:27] be praying about this and then all of a
[1:11:30] sudden god gives you a little door he
[1:11:32] gives you a little window and you say
[1:11:34] something show some care
[1:11:38] learn to listen hallelujah
[1:11:42] people don't really care what you know
[1:11:45] until they know how much you care
[1:11:49] and sometimes that takes some time and
[1:11:51] working on relationships a little bit
[1:11:54] is that okay i mean what brother john's
[1:11:56] talking about is actually very deep
[1:11:57] tonight you know
[1:11:58] your relationships that you have in your
[1:12:00] life is actually reflecting your
[1:12:03] personal revelation
[1:12:05] and your experience with god
[1:12:10] and you want to know the condition of a
[1:12:12] church
[1:12:14] many times the women in a church or the
[1:12:17] ladies reflect the teachings of a church
[1:12:20] and many times young people in a church
[1:12:22] reflect the revelation of their parents
[1:12:24] and of that church we can make great
[1:12:27] accolades
[1:12:28] and say a lot of things and have charts
[1:12:30] and powerpoints
[1:12:31] but our revelation is coming through our
[1:12:34] our assembly
[1:12:37] and we don't want there to be hidden
[1:12:39] heart trouble
[1:12:40] when god knows all about it and it's not
[1:12:43] being dealt with properly
[1:12:47] praise god you know people they hear
[1:12:48] these things
[1:12:50] and they just want to defend themselves
[1:12:52] they want to give an excuse about why it
[1:12:55] is the way it is
[1:12:56] they want to cast stones at someone else
[1:12:59] they don't want to take responsibility
[1:13:01] they don't want to take accountability
[1:13:03] they must want to keep propping up
[1:13:05] something of the past and
[1:13:07] divert attention and manipulate away
[1:13:10] but the holy spirit is dealing with
[1:13:12] something
[1:13:15] people will deny you they can hear the
[1:13:17] truth and know it's something they ought
[1:13:19] to do
[1:13:20] and they'll look right at you and deny
[1:13:23] and they'll shake their head
[1:13:24] they dismiss it and they give a reason
[1:13:27] they don't want to accept that they have
[1:13:29] a problem
[1:13:31] i had that in my notes to say to you
[1:13:33] tonight god i don't want to be like that
[1:13:36] we're dealing with a heart situation
[1:13:38] with a heart issue
[1:13:39] and how many believe a prophet when he
[1:13:41] said god heals by love
[1:13:44] he heals by understanding and by care
[1:13:47] just show them
[1:13:48] how much you care for them god heals by
[1:13:51] prayer
[1:13:52] by miracles god heals by his word god
[1:13:55] heals i'm the lord that healeth all thy
[1:13:58] diseases
[1:13:59] so it should work together and
[1:14:02] men in different ministries should work
[1:14:05] together for that
[1:14:07] you know friends that's why all the
[1:14:09] gifts in the ministry are different
[1:14:12] but rather than glomming onto one and
[1:14:14] saying oh the prophet one is the
[1:14:16] or the pr pastor or the evangelist and
[1:14:19] i gotta favorite this or i just like to
[1:14:21] hear this sister sing or
[1:14:23] that brother this rather than glomming
[1:14:26] on to the natural why
[1:14:28] don't you just step back and thank the
[1:14:29] lord because it's the holy spirit
[1:14:32] flowing through the body
[1:14:33] he's using these different gifts to get
[1:14:36] your heart
[1:14:37] to believe and to be healed
[1:14:42] the moment you go try to dissect
[1:14:44] everything and understand everything
[1:14:46] you just ended and hit a brick wall
[1:14:48] you'll never understand everything
[1:14:51] you get all nervous and upset and
[1:14:53] troubled i want to say tonight god cares
[1:14:55] for you
[1:14:56] now who enjoyed the binoculars somebody
[1:14:59] took them away from up here amen
[1:15:01] brother david you took them home didn't
[1:15:03] you you got them well that's okay
[1:15:06] i think people remember binoculars y'all
[1:15:10] remember that
[1:15:11] seeing the antelope and our brother was
[1:15:13] up here he was so skilled i found out
[1:15:15] later
[1:15:16] he knew how to use binoculars
[1:15:19] amen it was all fuzzy and everything
[1:15:22] trying to read that sign
[1:15:23] back there brother i'm talking to
[1:15:24] brother cosman because you all know what
[1:15:26] i'm talking about but
[1:15:27] brother cosman we had binoculars here
[1:15:29] this morning and somebody was back there
[1:15:31] and we couldn't read it because it was
[1:15:32] all fuzzy
[1:15:33] but the binoculars were focused in and
[1:15:36] we begin to realize that
[1:15:37] we need to have our binoculars focused
[1:15:40] in
[1:15:42] or we say well there's three antelope or
[1:15:44] four antelope no there's only one
[1:15:47] do we all got that well brother john
[1:15:49] didn't finish the quote tonight
[1:15:52] this morning so i'm going to lead you up
[1:15:54] to something while i was speaking about
[1:15:55] binoculars because it came to a
[1:15:57] situation
[1:15:59] in victory day brother branham was
[1:16:01] talking about this
[1:16:03] about god's binoculars and now is
[1:16:06] everybody listening
[1:16:07] i gotta say three things before we close
[1:16:09] tonight i gotta get to
[1:16:11] some things there was a young lady
[1:16:15] in victory day he's talking about this
[1:16:17] young lady that
[1:16:20] was in the service and he had had an
[1:16:22] interview with her
[1:16:23] she was a minister's daughter and she
[1:16:26] had had some kind of a love affair
[1:16:29] and she had lost her mind about it
[1:16:32] and she's gone she had a breakdown and a
[1:16:35] very beautiful
[1:16:36] young woman about 23 years old so
[1:16:40] now we have a 23 year old beautiful
[1:16:42] young lady
[1:16:44] a minister's daughter brother branham
[1:16:47] had went back into her life and when she
[1:16:49] was a little girl of about 12 years old
[1:16:53] she was in a mother meeting of brother
[1:16:55] branham's up at illinois
[1:16:58] listen a 12 year old girl and brother
[1:17:00] branham said the holy spirit went
[1:17:02] through the audience and
[1:17:03] called her who she was and said you've
[1:17:06] got a murmuring heart
[1:17:10] we're speaking on heart trouble and
[1:17:12] healing and
[1:17:13] here's a 12 year old girl that had a
[1:17:14] murmuring heart and the doctor
[1:17:17] said you can't live until you're 15
[1:17:19] years old that's three years
[1:17:21] but thus saith the lord you're healed
[1:17:25] so here now a 12 year old girl it would
[1:17:27] be like brother jackson and zoe
[1:17:30] and the doctor saying we found this
[1:17:32] murmuring heart
[1:17:33] she can't live until another three years
[1:17:35] of her life
[1:17:37] we would have got serious and a prayer
[1:17:39] request and brought her to a meeting
[1:17:41] and to have the holy spirit go out and
[1:17:43] call her name
[1:17:44] and say thus saith the lord you're
[1:17:46] healed
[1:17:48] and brother branham said she never never
[1:17:50] even felt a heart trouble
[1:17:52] since praise the lord
[1:17:56] god heals that was when she was 12.
[1:17:59] now she's 23 years old and brother madam
[1:18:02] said last night she had a different type
[1:18:04] of heart trouble
[1:18:06] it was a spiritual heart trouble
[1:18:09] and that's where brother john got this
[1:18:10] title for tonight spiritual
[1:18:12] heart trouble
[1:18:16] so now she was healed of a murmuring
[1:18:18] heart when she was young
[1:18:20] now she has a spiritual heart trouble
[1:18:22] her lover
[1:18:24] had run off and married some other woman
[1:18:26] yet she was still in love
[1:18:28] i want you to notice this she was still
[1:18:31] in love
[1:18:32] and this boy kept telling
[1:18:35] her that he was in love yet with her
[1:18:39] and then he said well your father caused
[1:18:41] all of this
[1:18:42] and brother branham said that's nonsense
[1:18:44] he didn't have to go marry this other
[1:18:46] girl
[1:18:47] he did it because he failed to have the
[1:18:49] right kind of love
[1:18:50] for you right so now she's a young lady
[1:18:54] in the church
[1:18:56] a beautiful young lady but she has
[1:18:59] literally lost her mind and
[1:19:01] brother brennam said she was all wound
[1:19:03] up into that the girl sat there in such
[1:19:05] a stoop like and
[1:19:07] said oh i know johnny loves me
[1:19:10] i know said that's all she could see
[1:19:16] she lived in that one little world by
[1:19:18] herself
[1:19:20] she had formed herself in there
[1:19:24] she's looking through the binoculars
[1:19:28] saying i love this gu johnny and
[1:19:31] he loves me and we're gonna be happily
[1:19:35] ever
[1:19:36] and whatever and it's uh causing trouble
[1:19:38] and he goes marries another girl
[1:19:41] and trying to blame it on the father and
[1:19:43] give all kinds of excuses
[1:19:45] he's left he's gone she's still in love
[1:19:48] and she has made herself a whole world
[1:19:52] she's living in and brother branham said
[1:19:55] that's all she could see
[1:19:57] she lived in that one little world by
[1:19:59] herself
[1:20:00] she had formed herself in there now
[1:20:02] isn't that amazing
[1:20:06] she was living in a world that wasn't
[1:20:08] even real
[1:20:11] she had formed herself in there i wonder
[1:20:14] how many times that happens among us
[1:20:17] people are actually living in another
[1:20:19] world
[1:20:21] is that have you noticed that and it's
[1:20:22] like wow this person
[1:20:25] it's like they've lost their mind
[1:20:28] and so brother bradham was very
[1:20:30] discerning and he just now this isn't
[1:20:32] inappropriate
[1:20:33] because her mother and father was there
[1:20:35] he took her by the hand
[1:20:37] like this and said listen to me
[1:20:41] and now here the lord showed him a
[1:20:43] vision
[1:20:45] you see she knowed that i know nothing
[1:20:47] about
[1:20:48] something had taken place some
[1:20:50] transaction
[1:20:52] between them now brother john's not here
[1:20:56] to tell you what that was but we already
[1:20:58] know that she was in a love affair
[1:21:02] so i'm just going to let the lord just
[1:21:05] let that go but there were things that
[1:21:07] had happened between a girl and a boy
[1:21:11] if you understand what i mean and
[1:21:12] brother branham goes in a vision
[1:21:15] and sees that
[1:21:18] and when i said that that snapped her
[1:21:21] right quick
[1:21:23] see nobody could touch that nobody knew
[1:21:26] that that had happened but the girl
[1:21:28] and the guy and now brother branham
[1:21:30] brother branham says that
[1:21:31] and it snaps her i said while you're
[1:21:35] out of there where do you come from
[1:21:38] i came from a world i had formed and it
[1:21:42] was literally driving her crazy
[1:21:45] brother branham speaks a word that no
[1:21:47] one knew
[1:21:49] but the boy and the girl the boy's gone
[1:21:51] the girls living in her world
[1:21:53] but the truth is spoken and she's
[1:21:55] brought out of that and brother branham
[1:21:57] says
[1:21:57] while you're out of there look to
[1:21:59] calvary
[1:22:01] that's why i'm saying tonight god heals
[1:22:04] god cares don't ever anybody in this
[1:22:07] building or on the internet ever say
[1:22:10] nobody cares nobody knows
[1:22:13] god knows god cares
[1:22:16] and if no one in the world cares to know
[1:22:19] that god cares i don't need my family my
[1:22:25] friends in a stadium full of 50
[1:22:27] 000 people cheering my name tonight to
[1:22:30] know that jesus knows
[1:22:32] jesus cares or to just say praise be to
[1:22:35] god
[1:22:36] but if you're not careful you'll build
[1:22:39] yourself
[1:22:39] a complex and start living in a world
[1:22:43] and it's not even real we need the word
[1:22:46] to come and
[1:22:47] burst that bubble and snap you out of
[1:22:50] that and say look to christ
[1:22:52] here's some binoculars here's a weekend
[1:22:55] of services here does a special meeting
[1:22:58] here you can visit from florida or visit
[1:23:00] from wherever
[1:23:01] you can click onto the internet and say
[1:23:03] why is he saying that
[1:23:04] and god's talking to you right now snap
[1:23:08] out of that world you're living in i
[1:23:11] can't brother john
[1:23:12] i can't that's why the word is coming
[1:23:15] like this
[1:23:15] to break the yoke the anointing breaks
[1:23:18] every yoke
[1:23:20] for what reason to bring healing
[1:23:24] to bring deliverance
[1:23:27] you don't need to have spiritual heart
[1:23:29] trouble
[1:23:31] i don't believe the bride is in a lot of
[1:23:34] confusion tonight
[1:23:35] we just read it out of ezekiel i will
[1:23:38] give you a new heart
[1:23:40] i will give you a new spirit and i will
[1:23:42] put my spirit on you so you don't
[1:23:44] need to be anxious over nothing
[1:23:49] are we all together now
[1:23:52] the lord showed him something he called
[1:23:55] it a transaction between them
[1:23:57] and it snapped her out
[1:24:00] then he said while you're out here look
[1:24:03] to calvary
[1:24:05] there you're gonna you're going out here
[1:24:07] and trying to
[1:24:09] started to drink a minister's daughter
[1:24:12] pentecostal minister's daughter
[1:24:14] doing the things that you're doing
[1:24:16] trying to drown
[1:24:18] that sorrow that man that somebody that
[1:24:22] don't care the snap
[1:24:23] of their finger for you i said
[1:24:27] look yonder to calvary girl that's the
[1:24:29] only way back
[1:24:31] paragraph 62 he said we've got to get
[1:24:34] ourselves
[1:24:34] focused till whether we live or die
[1:24:38] sink or drown it's calvary it's christ
[1:24:41] that's the thing that god wants us to
[1:24:43] come back
[1:24:44] to men in the focus of god's word
[1:24:47] instead of bringing it together and
[1:24:49] making it say the one thing that god
[1:24:50] says we look at the natural side
[1:24:53] hallelujah god break us out of the
[1:24:55] natural side some of you already fixing
[1:24:57] your job and
[1:24:58] fixing tomorrow you're already at school

[1:26:50] and then people go through things and
[1:26:52] they lose brotherly love
[1:26:54] and they don't have love for one another
[1:26:56] or understanding i'm still quoting
[1:26:58] understanding one another they don't
[1:27:00] love one and they worship with one
[1:27:02] they degrade a man because of the
[1:27:03] clothes he wears or the education or the
[1:27:05] color of his skin
[1:27:07] well that's not politically correct is
[1:27:08] it but
[1:27:10] brother branham said it start talking
[1:27:13] about this and that and the other and it
[1:27:14] separates people
[1:27:16] and man takes off after that paragraph
[1:27:20] 64.
[1:27:21] it never gives the inward man a chance
[1:27:23] to operate
[1:27:24] we're a triune being soul spirit and
[1:27:27] body
[1:27:28] he's talking about the natural mind and
[1:27:30] how the two spiritual forces that work
[1:27:33] in you and your mind and your spirit
[1:27:35] and he starts talking about the natural
[1:27:37] mind that's highly polished
[1:27:39] and things like that later in that
[1:27:41] paragraph i know you're trying to keep
[1:27:43] up with me but
[1:27:44] brother branham's talking about a person
[1:27:46] that throws themselves away from the
[1:27:47] spiritual man that's in you
[1:27:49] and there is what causes the trouble
[1:27:52] right there
[1:27:53] he tries to make it out in himself
[1:27:57] praise god is there any spiritual heart
[1:28:01] conditions in dallas
[1:28:04] conditions spiritual is not just natural
[1:28:09] it's not dealing with many times the
[1:28:12] soul and spirit
[1:28:13] the natural things i'm talking about
[1:28:16] when you talk about heart disease heart
[1:28:17] trouble but
[1:28:18] then there's a spiritual part that is
[1:28:21] going beyond the outside
[1:28:23] and what we can get ourselves in
[1:28:24] situations
[1:28:27] conditions heart conditions
[1:28:30] my we can get ourselves in situations
[1:28:33] i'm thankful for the scripture we read
[1:28:35] this morning
[1:28:36] that he's beautiful in situation how
[1:28:38] many years ever thought that lord
[1:28:40] what do you do with people like me
[1:28:45] i guess you all are angels hey anybody
[1:28:48] here ever said
[1:28:48] lord what do you do with people like me
[1:28:50] you know i knew better i've heard the
[1:28:53] you know and then we get in a place does
[1:28:55] that mean you're not a son of god you're
[1:28:57] not a
[1:28:57] no god just deals with us all
[1:29:00] differently we're all made up different
[1:29:04] but when we get in a condition it means
[1:29:07] that
[1:29:08] there's something out of order it's
[1:29:10] disorder
[1:29:11] it's a ailment or an illness
[1:29:14] you've come into a state and it's
[1:29:17] because of the situation you're in
[1:29:19] tonight i want to throw you a lifeline
[1:29:22] and say
[1:29:22] give you an announcement there is help
[1:29:25] for you tonight
[1:29:28] there is a healing agent or a bomb that
[1:29:31] can deal with that situation that can
[1:29:33] help in the time
[1:29:34] of need there is a bomb
[1:29:37] b-a-l-m healing in your city
[1:29:40] of dallas texas the great physician
[1:29:44] is very very near
[1:29:47] he's he's near right now i know some of
[1:29:50] you are tired
[1:29:51] and a little warm but the great
[1:29:53] physician isn't here
[1:29:55] i mean sometimes brother branham would
[1:29:57] be stalling stalling
[1:29:58] stalling and he would say you wonder why
[1:30:01] i'm waiting
[1:30:02] i'm waiting for him hello
[1:30:06] i'm waiting for him he's here
[1:30:12] now some of you may wonder how jesus
[1:30:16] died
[1:30:18] do you know that he died of a broken
[1:30:19] heart
[1:30:22] brother bottom talked about this and how
[1:30:24] it was not the roman spear that he died
[1:30:27] neither was it the loss of blood that he
[1:30:29] died because there was still blood in
[1:30:30] his body
[1:30:32] he said this in jeffersonville but he
[1:30:34] died
[1:30:35] what he died of was not the roman spear
[1:30:37] the nails that was drove in his hand or
[1:30:39] the thorny crown
[1:30:40] they placed on his head but because he
[1:30:42] died of grief
[1:30:45] he died of a broken heart
[1:30:50] do you all really believe that this is
[1:30:52] brother bradham saying
[1:30:53] jesus died of a broken heart and
[1:30:56] later in the paragraph 31 he said he
[1:30:59] died of a broken heart
[1:31:02] so much grief i'm saying these things
[1:31:06] for a reason
[1:31:06] who prayed tonight this brother prayed
[1:31:08] right here i appreciated that prayer
[1:31:10] brother
[1:31:11] that was wonderful i was sitting back
[1:31:13] there
[1:31:14] listening looking up that's incredible
[1:31:18] he's praying like that that really
[1:31:21] touched me
[1:31:23] jesus died of a broken heart
[1:31:27] that means it can really happen
[1:31:31] and if he died of a broken heart it can
[1:31:34] affect
[1:31:35] you and me do you all know that it's
[1:31:38] actually a physical
[1:31:40] ailment broken heart syndrome
[1:31:43] some of you that are medical might know
[1:31:45] this more than others
[1:31:46] i have it right in front of me but it's
[1:31:48] actually called
[1:31:52] broken heart syndrome it's a heart
[1:31:55] condition
[1:31:55] that's brought on by a lot of stressful
[1:31:58] situations and extreme
[1:32:00] emotions and it's triggered maybe by an
[1:32:03] illness or by a surgery or by stress
[1:32:07] you can actually die of a broken heart
[1:32:10] and
[1:32:10] if you don't die from it we have people
[1:32:13] all around us that are living daily
[1:32:15] and their heart is broken do you all
[1:32:19] understand that
[1:32:20] that's why they're on pills that's why
[1:32:22] they smoke
[1:32:23] that's why they drink that's why they
[1:32:25] run around and have parties and have sex
[1:32:27] parties and that's why they want to
[1:32:29] watch the olympics when they don't
[1:32:31] really know nobody
[1:32:32] and they only never been to japan and
[1:32:36] they're just caught up in this is sports
[1:32:38] and this it's entertainment they can
[1:32:40] sit in their chair and oh oh man that
[1:32:42] guy look at him well you haven't trained
[1:32:44] for the last 10 years
[1:32:46] oh you should have done this you don't
[1:32:48] know what you're talking about you're
[1:32:49] you're looking at some camera that's way
[1:32:51] above the field well why didn't he kick
[1:32:52] it to this guy he would
[1:32:54] well you're not down there and sweating
[1:32:56] it out and your brains have been bushed
[1:32:58] out and
[1:32:59] you're watching from some camera in some
[1:33:01] air condition whatever and you're like
[1:33:05] you don't have the perception and people
[1:33:08] that have lived their lives i'm saying
[1:33:10] this for a reason
[1:33:11] and you might have a hole in your heart
[1:33:13] you might have a murmuring heart
[1:33:15] and we have people right in our churches
[1:33:17] brother jackson that are literally
[1:33:18] living with broken hearts
[1:33:21] they've been broken they've been crushed
[1:33:24] i mean years ago we used to talk about
[1:33:26] it maybe in the years of the first
[1:33:28] years in the 70s and 80s and 90s of the
[1:33:31] denominations and broken marriages and
[1:33:34] all this and then
[1:33:35] we find out in the message then you have
[1:33:37] broken marriages and
[1:33:38] now we have children being raised up
[1:33:40] that don't serve the lord
[1:33:43] and then it becomes a different attitude
[1:33:46] toward the lost and toward
[1:33:49] we have people that are just single
[1:33:51] mothers or
[1:33:52] men that don't have a wife sitting next
[1:33:54] to them
[1:33:57] and they're literally living with a
[1:33:59] broken heart and it causes sudden
[1:34:02] chest pains sharp pains and
[1:34:05] shortness of breath
[1:34:09] maybe i better move along is that okay
[1:34:11] that i'm even saying those things
[1:34:13] we need to have more healing agents and
[1:34:16] care for one another
[1:34:18] listen to one another's testimony i
[1:34:20] think some of you would be shocked
[1:34:25] to know what other people's gone through
[1:34:27] i didn't know that about this
[1:34:29] man today i talked to at the restaurant
[1:34:36] i mean how would you live with a hole in
[1:34:38] your heart
[1:34:40] then you have surgery and then you live
[1:34:41] your life then starts giving you
[1:34:43] troubles and pains and you realize the
[1:34:45] scar
[1:34:46] tissue and you have a scarred heart
[1:34:52] friends i was born and raised in the
[1:34:54] message in jeffersonville
[1:34:57] but not everybody is born in the message
[1:35:00] not everybody had a mother and a father
[1:35:03] and everyone serving the lord in their
[1:35:05] family that's fantasy
[1:35:07] it's not even real there are families
[1:35:10] where many serve the lord and that's
[1:35:12] wonderful but
[1:35:13] all of us have had scars breakages
[1:35:17] but how long are you going to let that
[1:35:19] control
[1:35:20] your life your walk with the lord your
[1:35:23] walk with the believers the walk in your
[1:35:25] relationship
[1:35:26] how long are you going to let that
[1:35:28] dictate to you
[1:35:29] your level of joy
[1:35:34] how long are you going to let that or
[1:35:36] you why don't you just live
[1:35:38] every day to the fullest
[1:35:42] i asked the question this morning we
[1:35:44] didn't really answer it but
[1:35:46] do you know how long the average heart
[1:35:48] surgery takes
[1:35:49] how many hours the average heart
[1:35:54] surgery coronary artery bypass takes
[1:35:57] three to six hours
[1:36:00] and you're all in the waiting room y'all
[1:36:02] are listening
[1:36:04] some of you are fretting some of you on
[1:36:05] your phone some of you are wanting to go
[1:36:07] ask your boss
[1:36:08] how's mother doing how's susie doing how
[1:36:12] it's three or six it's not a 30-minute
[1:36:15] sermon
[1:36:16] that's going to deal with this issue and
[1:36:17] then if we're not careful
[1:36:19] we can get a bad attitude
[1:36:22] god's dealing with issues god's saying
[1:36:24] things you say well i don't know what
[1:36:26] you're talking about well
[1:36:27] the person behind you knows exactly what
[1:36:29] i'm talking about
[1:36:30] they might be sitting there right now
[1:36:32] and their heart is literally broken
[1:36:34] they're not shouting hallelujah they're
[1:36:36] not running the pews
[1:36:38] they're crushed
[1:36:44] three to six hours heart surgery
[1:36:48] heart trouble heart condition
[1:36:51] and then when they wheel you out of the
[1:36:53] room is it like
[1:36:54] jump up out of bed and let's go for a
[1:36:56] marathon no
[1:36:58] the average recovery time for a bypass
[1:37:02] heart surgery
[1:37:03] is six to 12 weeks
[1:37:08] you need rehabilitation you need to
[1:37:10] physical exercise where you have
[1:37:12] professional
[1:37:13] therapists they help strengthen your
[1:37:15] heart and they move you back so you can
[1:37:17] get back on the road again six to 12
[1:37:20] weeks you know we want life to just go
[1:37:23] on like it never happened well you might
[1:37:25] have to work at that
[1:37:28] hallelujah it takes time to heal
[1:37:33] we all want a miracle we all want the
[1:37:36] situation to stop right now in the end
[1:37:38] and be over
[1:37:40] well it's not always going to be like
[1:37:42] that
[1:37:44] there might be weeks of working with
[1:37:46] this and
[1:37:50] do you all know that when they take out
[1:37:52] a heart
[1:37:53] for heart surgery sometimes they
[1:37:55] literally have to take the heart out
[1:37:58] and start massaging it and working on it
[1:38:01] that that person's heart and their life
[1:38:03] is never the same
[1:38:04] because they've had human hands touch
[1:38:06] the heart how many know that
[1:38:08] it's a proven fact they literally have
[1:38:11] been proven in
[1:38:12] heart transplants that is where you need
[1:38:15] a heart
[1:38:16] transplant someone else's heart that's
[1:38:18] passed away
[1:38:19] in an accident or something and they
[1:38:21] give you that heart into another person
[1:38:24] do you understand what i mean you have
[1:38:26] need of a heart transplant and the
[1:38:28] average
[1:38:29] weight for a heart transplant is about
[1:38:32] five months
[1:38:33] 144 days you're in trouble
[1:38:36] you're in need you need a new heart
[1:38:40] well i want it like right now no you got
[1:38:42] to go on a list

[1:38:48] months so you're waiting you're waiting
[1:38:51] you're severe you're you're on the list
[1:38:54] you're on the list
[1:38:55] and then and something happens do you
[1:38:57] know that
[1:38:59] about half of the people on the heart
[1:39:01] transplantation
[1:39:03] list have been waiting for more than one
[1:39:05] year
[1:39:08] and many people die waiting for donor
[1:39:11] organs
[1:39:13] they literally expire their heart stops
[1:39:16] beating
[1:39:17] they're in need and if they had a new
[1:39:19] heart
[1:39:20] they could be saved many people die
[1:39:25] waiting for a new heart for a donor
[1:39:28] organ
[1:39:29] and we just read scripture tonight in
[1:39:31] ezekiel a new heart will i give you
[1:39:34] and my spirit will i give you i think
[1:39:37] that's an order we all need to take

[1:40:23] we're living in another world

[1:40:37] rough service

[1:40:51] that that brings spiritual life to the
[1:40:54] heart of our people
[1:40:56] what's it going to take to connect with
[1:40:57] our people
[1:40:59] because we're living in a dying
[1:41:01] generation where people are literally
[1:41:02] dying they're walking around living dead
[1:41:04] people
[1:41:05] and when they die if their hearts not
[1:41:08] right with the lord they're going into a
[1:41:09] waiting place
[1:41:12] and then to be at a judgment to go to
[1:41:14] hell
[1:41:17] that's just the way that it is i don't
[1:41:20] care your name
[1:41:21] your address how much money you give to
[1:41:23] missions
[1:41:24] or whatever if your heart's not right
[1:41:27] with god you're not going to be there

[1:41:29] maybe i'll be there because i was good
[1:41:31] and all that well you better
[1:41:33] friends i don't want to go through the
[1:41:34] tribulation either
[1:41:36] you're putting yourself way out there
[1:41:39] just to reject the word is to reject
[1:41:41] christ
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] do you all understand that to reject
[1:41:46] your day of visitation and god is saying
[1:41:48] here's an organ done brother cosman
[1:41:50] here's a new heart
[1:41:52] this teenager was running and had an
[1:41:54] accident and they're expired but here
[1:41:56] here's their heart and that they didn't
[1:41:58] make it but their heart and
[1:41:59] we're going to put it inside of you
[1:42:03] you know that it's proven this is what i
[1:42:06] was trying to get to
[1:42:07] that person that got the new heart they
[1:42:09] will many times have a lot of
[1:42:11] characteristics in nature of the person
[1:42:14] that gave them that heart
[1:42:16] and it has been studied and looked at
[1:42:18] scientifically it's because
[1:42:20] the heart carries the traits and the
[1:42:22] nature
[1:42:23] oh that's a wonderful thing friends what
[1:42:25] about the nature of god what about the
[1:42:27] heart
[1:42:28] of god how are you going to be when god
[1:42:31] puts his heart inside of you you're
[1:42:33] going to love the word
[1:42:34] you're going to love the message you're
[1:42:36] going to want more of god
[1:42:37] i can't get enough of the holy ghost
[1:42:40] give me more of this love
[1:42:41] give me more of this spirit i can't get
[1:42:44] enough of it
[1:42:46] see why are you acting so crazy because
[1:42:48] god put his heart
[1:42:50] inside of me
[1:42:54] do you know there has literally been
[1:42:55] divorces within the message
[1:42:57] when people came to the message i know
[1:43:00] of them personally
[1:43:02] where they came to the lord and the the
[1:43:04] man gave his heart to christ
[1:43:07] and literally the woman told the judge
[1:43:10] this ain't the man i married
[1:43:16] that's what she said she wants a divorce
[1:43:19] she won't have nothing to do with the
[1:43:21] message or
[1:43:21] christ this ain't the man i married
[1:43:25] and i know that's sad but the man is
[1:43:28] over here saying in his heart
[1:43:30] i know i'm not the same there's been a
[1:43:33] change in me
[1:43:35] and i don't want to be that old man and
[1:43:37] i'm sorry friends but
[1:43:39] we ought to be thankful to god there's
[1:43:41] been a change in us
[1:43:45] stop living in hell on earth
[1:43:51] when outside of the grace of god we'd
[1:43:53] all go to hell after earth
[1:43:56] stop living in hell and living in
[1:43:59] trouble and bad attitude and you know
[1:44:01] you're just trying to go through life
[1:44:04] my way or the highway we're not going to
[1:44:06] think the way you think
[1:44:08] you literally are thinking the thoughts
[1:44:10] of the devil
[1:44:13] you're living in a world all to yourself
[1:44:20] i'm going to talk to some people and get
[1:44:21] them thinking the way i'm thinking we
[1:44:23] don't want to think the way you're
[1:44:24] thinking and we don't want your attitude
[1:44:27] you need to read the scriptures we read
[1:44:28] i'm just being honest
[1:44:30] and read ezekiel and say a clean heart
[1:44:32] and he's going to clean you and wash you
[1:44:34] you need a good bath
[1:44:36] you need a good shower and a bath and a
[1:44:38] jacuzzi
[1:44:39] and you just need to stay in there until
[1:44:41] your heart's clean your mind's clean
[1:44:46] thank you sister i know i'm an old-timer
[1:44:48] but in the old days when you said a bad
[1:44:50] word
[1:44:50] your mother she she threatened you and
[1:44:53] sometimes she did it she washed your
[1:44:55] mouth out with soap
[1:44:57] y'all know what i'm talking about dove
[1:45:00] soap my mother did it sister joyce andy
[1:45:02] i said something bad when you do that
[1:45:04] you i'm gonna wash your mouth out with
[1:45:06] soap it's not a good thing
[1:45:10] stop cussing then stop
[1:45:13] saying those bad words hallelujah i have
[1:45:17] a good mother don't i brother
[1:45:19] amen well thank the lord it's got to go
[1:45:21] beyond washing your mouth out with soap
[1:45:23] it's got to come down to the heart you
[1:45:24] know
[1:45:25] you can drink three gallons of soap but
[1:45:27] you need to go down in your heart
[1:45:29] it'll clean out your stomach and you'll
[1:45:30] probably vomit
[1:45:32] but you need the heart of god you've got
[1:45:34] to grow up and make this
[1:45:36] your own revelation this is my god
[1:45:40] well what do y'all believe about this
[1:45:41] stop giving them a message book
[1:45:44] they ask where's christ today you ought
[1:45:46] to say here is christ
[1:45:51] hope i didn't offend you all there ought
[1:45:53] to be enough jesus flowing out of our
[1:45:55] lives that
[1:45:56] we can go through hell on earth and
[1:45:58] torment and brokenness but
[1:46:00] god has a way of healing amen
[1:46:04] now i need to get to something here
[1:46:06] that's what i was speaking about this
[1:46:07] morning
[1:46:08] about are we doing okay
[1:46:13] now he brother branham spoke about this
[1:46:17] and
[1:46:17] how the angel came to me and we're going
[1:46:19] down to the church of brother johnson
[1:46:22] brother johnson was a pastor and
[1:46:26] brother branham was going down the steps
[1:46:27] of his church brother johnson's church
[1:46:29] and i thought
[1:46:30] my he the way that he talked to me about
[1:46:33] this
[1:46:34] sunday school teacher i'd expect her to
[1:46:36] be in a straitjacket
[1:46:40] she's a sunday school teacher in brother
[1:46:42] johnson's church and
[1:46:43] but she was mentally gone
[1:46:47] and so i went down the steps and there
[1:46:49] stood a nice
[1:46:50] looking little lady about 30 years old
[1:46:54] she said how do you do brother branham i
[1:46:57] said are you the patient
[1:46:58] she said yes sir i said well what's the
[1:47:01] matter
[1:47:02] she said i don't know so i prayed for
[1:47:06] her
[1:47:07] and went on a few days after that on the
[1:47:10] street
[1:47:11] my wife and i met her and she had two
[1:47:13] women with her
[1:47:14] oh she was in such a condition she
[1:47:17] stepped up into a little place and
[1:47:19] i prayed for her again and when i went
[1:47:22] overseas now here's a prophet prayed for
[1:47:24] her sunday school teacher
[1:47:26] and she's mentally unstable brother
[1:47:30] branham goes overseas and she kept
[1:47:32] calling my wife
[1:47:33] she said oh if the angel of the lord
[1:47:35] ever visit him
[1:47:36] said i can't get out of this city away
[1:47:38] from here she was afraid
[1:47:40] she was mentally upset
[1:47:43] she'd been going to this famous
[1:47:45] psychiatrist in louisville
[1:47:48] which is just right across the river
[1:47:50] from jeffersonville it was louisville
[1:47:53] she'd been going to a psychiatrist from
[1:47:55] around eight years
[1:47:56] twice a week paying money
[1:48:01] and her poor husband was broke from
[1:48:03] keeping her and it didn't do no good
[1:48:06] she just kept on she'd went to every
[1:48:08] divine healing
[1:48:09] that came through the country they had
[1:48:12] them all there they poured enough oil on
[1:48:14] that girl
[1:48:15] anointing her to make a gallon i guess
[1:48:17] they'd stomp devils out they
[1:48:19] kicked they screamed they hollered
[1:48:21] everything else trying to
[1:48:22] and the devil don't care how much you
[1:48:24] kick and scream
[1:48:25] he just set right there he knows what
[1:48:27] he's doing and he knows how much
[1:48:29] authority he's got
[1:48:31] he hasn't got none when real faith is
[1:48:33] standing there
[1:48:34] but he's stripped of everything he's got
[1:48:36] but you have to know that
[1:48:38] i'm telling you tonight you're healed
[1:48:41] but you've got to believe that and rise
[1:48:44] up out of your heart condition
[1:48:47] and say god i can't serve you with this
[1:48:49] heart i need a new heart
[1:48:51] and god says well here's a new heart
[1:48:53] well god i can't serve you with the
[1:48:55] spirit i'm cankered i'm broken i
[1:48:58] well i'm gonna give you a new spirit
[1:48:59] thank you jesus i'm
[1:49:01] i'm not gonna i'm gonna take you further
[1:49:03] i'm gonna give you my spirit you say
[1:49:05] hallelujah
[1:49:06] i need the holy spirit and god said okay
[1:49:09] i'm gonna give you a double portion
[1:49:12] wouldn't you like to be sitting there
[1:49:13] tonight just gallons and gallons
[1:49:15] and the angels are just pouring the holy
[1:49:17] ghost on you and god's here and the holy
[1:49:19] ghost is here
[1:49:20] it's like you're the only person in the
[1:49:22] church you're like hallelujah
[1:49:30] maybe we need to have more church like
[1:49:31] that amen
[1:49:33] and you're just drinking it up and god's
[1:49:35] pouring it in and
[1:49:37] here's a lady that has mentally gone
[1:49:40] 30 years old she's a sunday school
[1:49:43] teacher in the church
[1:49:44] married to the deacon in the church
[1:49:48] we just think everything's fine but it's
[1:49:50] not fine
[1:49:54] and she'd been everywhere people have
[1:49:56] been praying for her from all over the
[1:49:58] country for years and
[1:50:00] one morning in the house i know i'm
[1:50:02] skipping through here
[1:50:04] i'm trying to save some time but the
[1:50:05] angel of the lord came into the house
[1:50:07] and the
[1:50:08] wife and all of them was there and they
[1:50:10] said bill let us call that woman
[1:50:13] little woman i said sure call her and i
[1:50:16] went out and i was sitting in the room
[1:50:18] i had to hurry out there my wife said
[1:50:20] now get this little girl or this
[1:50:22] little woman she had two or three little
[1:50:24] children
[1:50:26] can you all see that she has two or
[1:50:29] three children
[1:50:30] and she's mentally just broken
[1:50:34] yet a sunday school teacher and i walked
[1:50:37] in there she was only thing i'd seen her
[1:50:39] these couple times knowed she belonged
[1:50:40] to the bapti
[1:50:41] methodist church main street methodist
[1:50:44] church in new albany and she was sitting
[1:50:46] there holding her hands like this
[1:50:48] i said what's the matter says she said i
[1:50:50] don't know brother branham
[1:50:51] said i guess i'm just crazy
[1:50:56] i don't want to ask any personal
[1:50:57] questions but
[1:51:00] there's probably times in your life you
[1:51:01] think lord am i going crazy
[1:51:03] have i lost my mind i said i don't think
[1:51:07] so
[1:51:07] you don't talk like a crazy person to me
[1:51:11] so i had to get her mind stretched
[1:51:14] different
[1:51:17] you see till i could get her
[1:51:21] off of that thought
[1:51:24] that's what i've been trying to do this
[1:51:26] morning and tonight
[1:51:28] some of you don't even realize it but
[1:51:30] god's had his hand in your life trying
[1:51:31] to
[1:51:32] stretch out your thoughts you're living
[1:51:34] out in a world all by yourself
[1:51:36] you're looking at things through some
[1:51:37] binoculars and it's all fuzzy
[1:51:40] and you're making decisions off all that
[1:51:42] fuzziness
[1:51:43] and god's trying to stretch out your
[1:51:45] mind
[1:51:46] to think the way he thinks start looking
[1:51:49] at it the way
[1:51:50] he's looking at it that's why you're in
[1:51:52] that condition
[1:51:53] and while you have such trouble you're
[1:51:56] looking at it wrong
[1:51:58] oh your heart's wrong and god's saying
[1:52:00] i'm here to give you a new heart
[1:52:03] this sister was in trouble i said let's
[1:52:06] take a little trip and let's go back and
[1:52:08] he starts talking about the word a
[1:52:09] little bit in a few moments i felt the
[1:52:11] angel
[1:52:12] of the lord pulling into this channel
[1:52:14] and when i did i seen a little
[1:52:16] black car running like that
[1:52:20] right across my room
[1:52:24] i said was you ever in an accident she
[1:52:26] said no sir
[1:52:27] now on the platform i'd have prayed for
[1:52:31] her
[1:52:32] and let her go
[1:52:38] i wonder how many of our church services
[1:52:40] are ending like this
[1:52:42] we hear a word we pray
[1:52:46] and we all go
[1:52:49] and that's why there's people sitting
[1:52:50] right in our churches like this
[1:52:53] totally going crazy
[1:52:56] i'm being real honest tonight you might
[1:52:58] call me crazy
[1:52:59] i'm just saying by experience there's
[1:53:02] things that go on
[1:53:03] it's just like this people pray and they
[1:53:06] go out
[1:53:07] and we're going right back to square one
[1:53:09] they're going crazy
[1:53:11] they're living in another world they're
[1:53:13] a sunday school teacher they're a deacon
[1:53:14] they're whoever they're just
[1:53:17] they're gone they're living in another
[1:53:18] world
[1:53:20] and we need our services to go out into
[1:53:22] that world and bring them back
[1:53:24] and catch that young lady's wondering
[1:53:26] spirit and bring her back
[1:53:31] god help us tonight i know we're in a
[1:53:33] time crunch and it's late in the evening
[1:53:35] but
[1:53:37] this is heart surgery
[1:53:40] she had two or three children
[1:53:46] now on the platform paragraph 42 i'd
[1:53:49] have prayed for her and let her go
[1:53:50] but i had her before me so i watched it
[1:53:54] again just a minute and the first thing
[1:53:56] you know hear it come
[1:53:57] and i seen the vision break then come
[1:53:59] right straight in and it caught me
[1:54:02] no way of getting away then i said i see
[1:54:04] a little car
[1:54:06] you're sitting by a blond-headed man
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:09] and there's an automobile coming
[1:54:13] and you pass then there's a big light
[1:54:16] it's a train and there went the vision
[1:54:20] she let out a scream and jumped on the
[1:54:23] floor
[1:54:24] and fainted jumped out on the floor and
[1:54:27] so the vision went on
[1:54:29] so she's laying on the floor she fainted
[1:54:34] here it was when she got married just
[1:54:37] before
[1:54:38] her husband went overseas and just a few
[1:54:41] weeks
[1:54:42] she was a young woman this last war
[1:54:45] he went overseas and her being just a
[1:54:48] girl
[1:54:49] she started running around being
[1:54:50] lonesome
[1:54:52] she started running around with another
[1:54:54] man
[1:54:57] and she went out in a little car with
[1:54:59] him one night
[1:55:01] and lived untrue to her marriage vow and
[1:55:04] on the road home
[1:55:05] was almost killed by a train
[1:55:09] i told her all about what she had did
[1:55:12] and then when she raised up off the
[1:55:13] floor
[1:55:14] remember she had fainted
[1:55:19] she's getting back up
[1:55:23] screaming to the top of her voice and
[1:55:25] the wife come in there and said what was
[1:55:27] the matter
[1:55:28] she said brother branham don't you tell
[1:55:31] that to nobody
[1:55:33] what are you talking about heart trouble
[1:55:39] i'm not talking about the symptoms and
[1:55:41] going crazy
[1:55:43] she's in a world i'm talking about heart
[1:55:45] trouble
[1:55:46] and when the great physician puts his
[1:55:48] finger on the heart trouble
[1:55:50] don't tell that to nobody that was her
[1:55:52] first response
[1:55:58] i said i thought you told me you was a
[1:55:59] christian
[1:56:01] she said i am i've confessed that to god
[1:56:05] years ago i said
[1:56:08] god it wasn't god you sinned against it
[1:56:11] was your husband and your marriage vow
[1:56:13] you as a married woman i said you'll
[1:56:15] have to go make that right with your
[1:56:17] husband
[1:56:18] if you ever get well
[1:56:22] oh she said i can't do it
[1:56:25] it'd break our home up she said i've got
[1:56:27] three children and she said
[1:56:29] my husband will leave me
[1:56:34] i said now lady i've done all i can do i
[1:56:37] said you know
[1:56:38] there isn't a psychiatrist in the world
[1:56:40] can pull that out of you
[1:56:42] i've been to a psychiatrist the last
[1:56:44] eight years two times a week
[1:56:46] he never said nothing about that they
[1:56:48] didn't know that
[1:56:51] and even if they did probably the
[1:56:53] psychiatrist is doing the same thing
[1:56:55] anyway
[1:56:57] what's wrong with that we all got things
[1:56:59] in our and
[1:57:00] go out on some tangent friends it's not
[1:57:02] those things that's going to bring
[1:57:04] deliverance
[1:57:04] only being in the presence of god and
[1:57:07] having a gift of god and have that
[1:57:09] exposed then you got to respond right
[1:57:11] well don't tell nobody well that's
[1:57:13] probably all that's like
[1:57:15] sounds like cain
[1:57:18] am i my brother's keeper sounds like a
[1:57:22] adam the woman thus now gave me it's the
[1:57:25] old nature
[1:57:27] i thought you told me you were a
[1:57:28] christian well no no no and she goes
[1:57:31] right into i've got children
[1:57:33] my husband will leave me it'll break up
[1:57:35] our home
[1:57:37] brother brahm said there isn't a
[1:57:38] psychiatrist in the world can pull that
[1:57:40] out of you that's way back in the gable
[1:57:42] end of your soul
[1:57:43] and you just you subconsciously think of
[1:57:45] it till you got yourself from that
[1:57:47] condition
[1:57:48] i said that's the whole thing
[1:57:52] brother brown said now that's the truth
[1:57:54] you know it's the truth
[1:57:55] there's no other person in the world but
[1:57:58] you
[1:57:59] that man and me that knows this now
[1:58:04] she said that's right but said
[1:58:07] i just couldn't make it right
[1:58:12] i said well that's all i can do. he said
[1:58:14] well you're not going to leave brother
[1:58:16] branham was probably going like this
[1:58:18] you know i got to go and there's people
[1:58:20] right on the other side of the wall he
[1:58:21] was living in jefferson
[1:58:23] i got to go i've already told you what
[1:58:25] to do
[1:58:27] i've already told you you went to the
[1:58:28] heart of the matter god was good to you
[1:58:31] it's the goodness of god she wasn't
[1:58:34] taking it like that
[1:58:37] oh it's the goodness of god that god's
[1:58:40] even talking to you like this tonight
[1:58:42] you might not be this same person but
[1:58:44] god's talking to you in a way
[1:58:46] that's his love and grace to even bring
[1:58:48] it to your attention
[1:58:50] now what are we going to do about it wow
[1:58:53] well here we are
[1:58:54] and brother branham's like
[1:58:57] um you're not you're not going to leave
[1:58:59] me she said yes
[1:59:01] yes ma'am there's a man sitting in this
[1:59:02] room is this this man here
[1:59:04] he's very seriously ill fevered in the
[1:59:06] morning i said i've got to go in there's
[1:59:08] some more people coming she said oh i
[1:59:10] can't sin
[1:59:10] what must i do i said go
[1:59:14] call your husband and make it right
[1:59:17] get right get the thing clean that's the
[1:59:20] only thing to do it
[1:59:22] she said well she said i just can't do
[1:59:25] it i
[1:59:25] i'll die just started on like that and
[1:59:30] oh brother madam happened to look around
[1:59:34] and all of a sudden something starts
[1:59:35] happening something forming by the side
[1:59:37] of her
[1:59:38] and i looked it's another vision and
[1:59:41] there stood a man
[1:59:42] black-headed combed his hair over kind
[1:59:45] of sideways kind of wavy
[1:59:47] a little older than she was i said your
[1:59:50] husband is a black-headed man
[1:59:52] she said yes sir kind of tall
[1:59:55] yes sir isn't he a deacon in the church
[1:59:58] she said yes sir i said he works for a
[2:00:02] chevrolet company doesn't he
[2:00:04] yes sir i said he has the same thing
[2:00:08] to confess to you
[2:00:13] then brother branham said something that
[2:00:15] applies to this local church and any
[2:00:18] other church
[2:00:19] no wonder brother johnson can have a
[2:00:22] revival
[2:00:24] no wonder the local church can have a
[2:00:26] revival
[2:00:28] there's sin in the church the sunday
[2:00:30] school teachers in sin
[2:00:32] the deacons in sin nobody wants to say
[2:00:35] nothing about it
[2:00:36] god bless you brother god bless you
[2:00:38] sister thank you for talking about

[2:00:47] right we're not happy we're going crazy
[2:00:52] and the devil's in the fine print
[2:01:01] so the church is locked up
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:04] no revival no stir their sin in the camp
[2:01:07] there's unconfessed sin
[2:01:09] brother branham said this no wonder
[2:01:12] brother johnson can't have a revival
[2:01:15] i said looky here now this is real this
[2:01:17] is good
[2:01:19] this is uncovering things i said your
[2:01:22] husband

[2:07:24] layers of issues and matters but the
[2:07:26] lord jesus

[2:08:09] congregation
[2:08:13] and that's wonderful i just pray the
[2:08:16] lord will bless you
[2:08:17] bless your lives
[2:08:21] i'm not a great big soccer lover but
[2:08:24] some of you might have heard in the news
[2:08:25] in the last several weeks of a
[2:08:28] they had the danish they had the soccer
[2:08:31] champ tournaments going on in europe and
[2:08:34] there was a danish soccer player that
[2:08:36] collapsed on the field
[2:08:38] from denmark did anybody hear about that
[2:08:40] he was his young
[2:08:41] player christian eriksen was his name
[2:08:44] and
[2:08:44] my he was 29 years old one of their star
[2:08:47] players and he's running running running
[2:08:50] he was on the team and all of a sudden
[2:08:51] he collapsed
[2:08:54] he suffered a cardiac arrest
[2:08:58] it was a denmark was playing finland in
[2:09:01] a euro soccer match his heart stopped
[2:09:04] and he literally had to be resuscitated
[2:09:07] on the field
[2:09:08] with a defibrillator this happened on
[2:09:10] saturday
[2:09:11] june the 12th one article said they
[2:09:14] revived him
[2:09:16] they brought him back and
[2:09:20] i was just thinking about that not so
[2:09:23] much about soccer or this but
[2:09:25] if a natural player of a soccer game can
[2:09:27] be revived
[2:09:29] and brought back to life can a spiritual
[2:09:33] life
[2:09:33] of a person be revived and brought back
[2:09:37] to life
[2:09:39] you're running well you're going along
[2:09:41] all of a sudden
[2:09:42] something happened and it just puts you
[2:09:44] out of commission it's like moved you
[2:09:46] off track and then
[2:09:47] you collapse and it's oh you're
[2:09:49] suffering all the players they formed
[2:09:52] kind of like because he was being
[2:09:53] resuscitated they formed like a
[2:09:55] wall around him this was their player
[2:09:58] and he was
[2:09:58] he was down he was out and if a natural
[2:10:01] player
[2:10:02] can get up now and then he was revived
[2:10:04] and they that team went on
[2:10:06] it inspired the team for many many games
[2:10:08] they went further
[2:10:10] than ever would have thought because of
[2:10:11] the inspiration
[2:10:13] of this that he was brought back to life
[2:10:16] then what about a son or a daughter of
[2:10:18] god that has been living
[2:10:20] and walking then all of a sudden they
[2:10:21] get hit over there there's no life
[2:10:24] there's no energy there's no desire
[2:10:26] can god bring them back again i'm asking
[2:10:29] you a question tonight
[2:10:31] i'm a visitor coming to dallas is that
[2:10:34] possible
[2:10:35] that god revive and bring them back
[2:10:38] again
[2:10:39] where they can walk they can run they
[2:10:41] can live
[2:10:42] they can eat food they can rejoice
[2:10:48] stop putting all the glory out there in
[2:10:50] science and the world
[2:10:52] it's god that heals
[2:10:56] i'm not here to talk about that soccer
[2:10:59] player that man from denmark 29 year old
[2:11:01] man
[2:11:02] christian was his name i'm here to talk
[2:11:04] about you
[2:11:05] or other brothers and sisters in the
[2:11:07] body is it possible
[2:11:08] they could be right around you near you
[2:11:11] and they fall out
[2:11:12] but god has another plan to revive them
[2:11:15] to heal them to get them back up on the
[2:11:18] road again
[2:11:19] they will live again
[2:11:24] then where's our attitude tonight
[2:11:26] where's our spirit at have you lost all
[2:11:28] hope have you got so old now have you
[2:11:30] have you accumulated so much in your
[2:11:33] life that you just don't hardly believe
[2:11:35] no more i say god forgive us of that and
[2:11:38] give us a new heart
[2:11:39] and a new spirit if i've lost something
[2:11:42] in the battle
[2:11:43] put it back into me lord hello soldiers
[2:11:49] i'm leaving you in a few minutes to go
[2:11:53] but may god breathe into your life
[2:11:56] may the great physician take your heart
[2:11:59] and if he's got to bring it out here
[2:12:01] massage it a little bit and put it back
[2:12:03] in or if he's just got to take out a
[2:12:05] stony heart and say
[2:12:07] we're going to have to start all over
[2:12:09] and put a new heart in
[2:12:11] and put a new spirit in and just say you
[2:12:13] know what that spirit is so
[2:12:15] contentorous and stubborn i'm going to
[2:12:18] give them
[2:12:18] my spirit where you can just say glory
[2:12:22] be to god that's exactly what i want
[2:12:24] anyway
[2:12:25] don't stop with a church life don't stop
[2:12:27] with just being a good person
[2:12:29] you can be a sunday school teacher you
[2:12:31] can be a deacon

[2:19:12] and a prophet said you've been deceived
[2:19:15] you've done the most horriblest thing
[2:19:17] you know what it was they should have
[2:19:18] responded the first time
[2:19:25] is that right they should have responded
[2:19:28] to the word
[2:19:31] we're 2021 and sometimes we just close a
[2:19:35] service and we go out
[2:19:37] and maybe that one little brother
[2:19:40] but i wonder sometimes how many needs
[2:19:42] are among us brother benham said
[2:19:43] there's two or three hundred of you
[2:19:45] ought to be at this altar and he said oh
[2:19:47] it's all packed out now
[2:19:48] ministers coming up and down you say wow
[2:19:50] we had a revival no
[2:19:52] that's not a revival the revival is the
[2:19:54] one that responded to the word
[2:19:56] we're 20 21 and if god would bring a
[2:20:00] gift
[2:20:01] and then start discerning our needs and
[2:20:02] our addresses and our
[2:20:04] i'm sure this whole building they'll be
[2:20:06] crying out on people
[2:20:07] but friends that's not the response that
[2:20:10] god's looking for
[2:20:12] god's looking for the one he's looking
[2:20:14] for the two he's looking for the altars
[2:20:16] being packed out or you that are sitting
[2:20:18] out there to come to a revelation i need
[2:20:20] help or
[2:20:21] i'm in trouble to make that decision
[2:20:24] without
[2:20:25] someone saying your name and your need
[2:20:28] and for brother john now to take 15 more
[2:20:31] minutes and tell you what your address
[2:20:33] is and what you've been thinking and
[2:20:34] friends that's not going to keep you in
[2:20:36] a time of trouble
[2:20:37] we need the response to be at the word
[2:20:40] of god
[2:20:41] now i really labored to close with that
[2:20:44] because that's a great need today among
[2:20:47] us we're sunday night it's time to go
[2:20:50] and we're tired and we're i know we are
[2:20:54] but god help us not to have a
[2:20:56] congregation full of hundreds of people
[2:20:59] that won't respond to the word yet they
[2:21:02] will respond to some little gift some
[2:21:03] little emotion some little this
[2:21:05] and you can hear the people oh they're
[2:21:07] crying god help all of us
[2:21:11] do you agree we're years down the road
[2:21:15] and god took that gift off the scene
[2:21:17] most of us
[2:21:18] brother david brother billy brother
[2:21:20] matthew brother andrew now myself
[2:21:22] we would just maybe close the service
[2:21:24] and let's all go home
[2:21:28] don't be living here and literally be
[2:21:32] living in another world
[2:21:33] and your mind crazy sunday school
[2:21:36] teacher deacon preacher whoever you
[2:21:38] are don't let satan do that to you
[2:21:42] with heart trouble heart condition be
[2:21:44] willing to admit it be
[2:21:46] be willing to confess openly you don't
[2:21:49] need a prophet
[2:21:50] or a prayer line you just need to be
[2:21:53] honest after hearing the word today
[2:21:56] and go do the right thing under the
[2:21:59] anointing
[2:22:00] and the power of what you heard today
[2:22:02] has enough chemistry in it
[2:22:04] to change your body
[2:22:07] let's stand to our feet
[2:22:10] lord jesus i pray tonight as we've heard
[2:22:14] your word
[2:22:16] been long this morning and long today if
[2:22:18] you see the time code
[2:22:19] on the service it's two or three hours
[2:22:22] forgive us lord
[2:22:26] if it takes that long to get through our
[2:22:28] hearts
[2:22:29] and our minds and the busyness of life
[2:22:31] and the weariness
[2:22:34] oh jesus come to us lord as your people
[2:22:37] fill us with your presence
[2:22:39] heal those that are sick those that are
[2:22:42] wounded
[2:22:43] those that are broken i'm asking lord
[2:22:46] jesus
[2:22:48] for your presence now to come like oil
[2:22:50] and
[2:22:51] put oil put wine
[2:22:54] onto those wounds heal the brokenhearted
[2:22:59] for you came this was one
[2:23:02] vindication of your ministry you came to
[2:23:05] bind up the brokenhearted and heal those
[2:23:07] that
[2:23:08] hearts were broken jesus
[2:23:12] if there's someone here who is crying
[2:23:15] out
[2:23:16] maybe they don't even understand their
[2:23:18] need or the depth of it would you answer
[2:23:20] their cry lord
[2:23:23] would you minister to every single
[2:23:24] person
[2:23:26] that you minister to their hearts
[2:23:30] minister to us jesus
[2:23:33] we want to see a change in our families
[2:23:35] and our church
[2:23:36] and our relationships
[2:23:40] as we drive down the road lord let us be
[2:23:42] willing to talk about the things we
[2:23:43] heard today
[2:23:45] and not about the news and the politics
[2:23:47] and something funny something goofy some
[2:23:50] joke some
[2:23:51] how's the children doing how's the job
[2:23:53] going but let us be willing to just take
[2:23:55] that
[2:23:56] step that spiritual step
[2:24:02] oh father heal our land
[2:24:06] take away anything in our lives that's
[2:24:08] not right with you
[2:24:10] and give us courage and strength to do
[2:24:12] the right thing lord
[2:24:14] if it needs to be another step after the
[2:24:16] service
[2:24:17] there needs to be another step lord
[2:24:19] something made right
[2:24:21] give that person strength and courage to
[2:24:23] go back to their father their mother
[2:24:26] their husband their wife or someone else
[2:24:28] and make something right
[2:24:30] so that we don't have to live with that
