[37:24] and five were foolish they that were
[37:27] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[37:29] with them but the wise took oil in their
[37:32] vessels with their lamps while the
[37:34] bridegroom carried they all slumbered
[37:37] and slept and at the midnight there was
[37:40] a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh
[37:44] go ye out to meet
[37:46] him then all those virgins arose and
[37:50] trimmed their lamps I want you to notice
[37:53] all 10 of them Rose and trimmed their
[37:54] lamps but one was trimmed ring their
[37:57] lamps for nothing they didn't even have
[37:59] any oil but they were all going through
[38:01] the motions they were all going to
[38:03] church they were all screaming and
[38:05] shouting and rejoicing but one of them
[38:07] had oil now we're not talking about just
[38:10] oil on the flesh but somebody had the
[38:11] indwelling of the spirit they had
[38:14] something to take them and pack them
[38:16] into the presence of their bridegroom
[38:19] amen my we just are excited to be here
[38:22] and be able to minister for a little bit
[38:23] if you also turn in your Bibles to uh
[38:25] Romans chap chapter
[38:27] 7 we're going to be pulling our
[38:29] inspiration from invisible
[38:31] Union and um this this message would
[38:35] really just uh something on my heart
[38:37] maybe I'll just tell you now I want to
[38:38] speak to you a little bit uh on the
[38:40] thought Rapture Ready Rapture Ready and
[38:44] now my subject would be married to
[38:46] another married to another in Romans 7
[38:49] uh it would read like this if you're
[38:51] there it would read know ye not brethren
[38:53] for I speak to them that know the law so
[38:56] he's not speaking to people who are
[38:57] ignorant and haven't uh heard what the
[39:00] the the prophets of old or Moses law
[39:01] have been taught but it says how that
[39:03] the law hath dominion over a man as long
[39:05] as he liveth for the woman which hath an
[39:08] husband is bound by the law to her
[39:11] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[39:14] husband be dead she is loosed from the
[39:18] law of her husband so we Paul is laying
[39:20] on this principle there's only one way
[39:22] to be loosed from the law that is that
[39:27] husband is dead so then if while her
[39:29] husband liveth she be married to another
[39:31] man she is called an adulteress but if
[39:34] her husband be dead she is free from the
[39:36] law so that she is no adulteress though
[39:40] she be married to another man so you're
[39:42] going to notice uh Paul is going to say
[39:44] married to another notice this phrase I
[39:46] believe three or four times he says
[39:47] though she be married to another man
[39:49] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[39:51] Deb to the law by the body of Christ
[39:54] that ye should be married to another
[39:58] now who who are we being married
[40:01] to who are we being married
[40:04] to even to him who is raised from the
[40:09] dead that we should bring forth fruit
[40:12] unto God so if we are being married to
[40:15] another and we being being married to
[40:18] Christ the word then we are bringing
[40:19] forth fruit unto God Amen you may have
[40:22] your seats as you turn in your Bibles to
[40:24] Revelations 19 the prophet of God would
[40:27] say in invisible Unity he'd say to be in
[40:29] the bride you have to be remarried to
[40:31] the word of God which is Christ so to be
[40:35] to be in the bride so we're just going
[40:38] to take some time by the grace of God
[40:40] and just labor maybe to to lay a
[40:42] foundation of how we are being prepared
[40:44] and how we are being ready to be in this
[40:46] Rapture as you tur in your Bibles just
[40:49] looking into Revelations chapter
[40:52] 19 and verse
[40:55] 7
[40:57] we we're going to have uh maybe a lot of
[40:59] material to move through we tried to to
[41:02] prep uh the brothers in the back to
[41:04] maybe have scriptures and quotes
[41:05] available so we can maybe uh try not to
[41:08] move too quickly but quickly enough to
[41:10] try to cover some ground certainly won't
[41:12] be able to catch it all but uh the
[41:14] portion that God would have for you we
[41:16] pray that you would receive
[41:18] it it says let us be glad and
[41:22] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[41:24] marriage of the Lamb is come
[41:27] and his wife hath made herself
[41:32] ready let us be
[41:34] glad well we can just close up our
[41:38] Bibles just close them
[41:41] up I like brother Billy said one time we
[41:43] were fellowshipping and he said somebody
[41:45] has to you know brother brandham said we
[41:46] could go out and read our Bible and just
[41:48] and that's all we need for church
[41:50] somebody got to manifest that one of us
[41:52] might do it one
[41:54] day let us be glad and
[41:58] rejoice that's a good way to start
[42:00] service let us be glad and rejoice in
[42:03] this Thanksgiving season we got a lot to
[42:04] be thankful for let us be glad and
[42:07] rejoice well what are you happy about
[42:09] what are you rejoicing for why are you
[42:11] excited what be why because the marriage
[42:14] of the Lamb is at
[42:16] hand
[42:18] hallu and this marriage could only take
[42:20] place because the word has been
[42:23] restored Christ the word has been
[42:26] restored and is present amongst us that
[42:28] we can be married in an invisible Union
[42:31] to
[42:32] him I'll just read this portion out of
[42:35] um uh um invisible Union uh brother
[42:38] brandom at the very end of paragraph 379

[45:07] don't know how to Pace myself you
[45:08] forgive me uh we just want to read this
[45:10] out of the Rapture maybe if they can put
[45:12] that up for for us
[45:18] here the first thing that comes when he
[45:21] starts descending from Heaven there's a
[45:23] shout what is it it's a message to get
[45:26] the people together a message comes
[45:28] forth first now it's lamp trimming time
[45:30] so so we're seeing we're pulling Matthew
[45:33] 25 right into here rise and trim your
[45:35] lamps what was that the seventh not the
[45:38] sixth the seventh behold the bridegroom
[45:40] cometh rise and trim your lamps and they
[45:44] did some of them found they didn't have
[45:46] any oil in their lamp see but it's lamp
[45:48] trimming time it's Malachi 4 time it's
[45:52] Luke 17 it's all those prophecies that
[45:55] it can fit perfectly and set in order
[45:57] for this day in the scripture we see it
[46:00] living right here so what is the prophet
[46:02] doing the proom the prophet is showing
[46:05] us our Promised Land he's showing us the
[46:08] hour that we're living in he's showing
[46:10] us our borders he's showing us what what
[46:12] our expectation is for the age that what
[46:15] can I expect what am I looking for look
[46:17] Joshua and Caleb uh they had evidence of
[46:20] a good land they knew where the land was
[46:22] they came back packing the fruits they
[46:24] came back saying look what the prophet
[46:26] said is true it's a good land it's over
[46:28] there let us go we're more than able to
[46:31] take it so now the prophet is coming
[46:33] he's telling the bride look it's a good
[46:35] land here's the evidence of it this is
[46:37] your borders this is your land this is
[46:39] your boundaries oh and I want to say to
[46:41] the bride There Is No Boundaries all
[46:43] things are possible to them that believe
[46:45] look we don't have to be bound down here
[46:47] by some man's theology or some man's
[46:50] idea that can tell you you can only go
[46:51] so high but this bride has broken out of
[46:54] the horse and buggy age we've broken out
[46:56] of the airplane age we've gone into the
[46:58] astronaut age why because there is an
[47:00] astronaut here Jesus Christ has risen
[47:03] amongst his bride that all things are
[47:05] possible to them that
[47:07] believe what is he doing the prophet is
[47:09] showing our expectation I want to say
[47:11] our expectation Rapture our expectation
[47:14] is the change of our bodies Our
[47:16] expectation is the promises that lay in
[47:18] the written word I say there a yay and
[47:21] amen to every promise it's laying right
[47:23] there if you can believe it oh you can
[47:26] have it what do you have need of tonight
[47:29] look we might not get another church
[47:31] service this might be a you might as
[47:32] well get all you came
[47:34] for don't wait for Sunday don't wait for
[47:36] tomorrow but Christ is resurrected
[47:38] amongst us he's right here right now
[47:41] he's amongst us what do you have need of
[47:43] we have an open book it's an open book
[47:45] test that's right we're not wondering
[47:48] what the answers are are we wondering
[47:51] are we ponding are we groping in
[47:53] darkness wondering where we're at where
[47:55] we're going this is an open book I love
[47:56] open book
[48:00] test well what was it you said back
[48:02] there brother Billy I I thought I'd
[48:03] preach on which one am I yeah I thought
[48:06] I'd preach on that a little bit he was
[48:08] looking at there we got these little
[48:09] fancy tablets now you can adjust your
[48:11] your your sound and everything like that
[48:13] they wanted to give me one I was like I
[48:14] wouldn't even know what to do with that
[48:15] I'd make a mess up things and I'd spend
[48:17] 30 minutes trying to figure out the
[48:18] tablet we wouldn't get nowhere but I
[48:20] guess on there you have a designation
[48:22] like this mik has a designation and so
[48:24] he's asking him which one am
[48:27] I what do you have to wonder which one
[48:29] are you
[48:30] tonight am I the eagle or am I the crow
[48:34] am I the sinner that that that's that's
[48:36] lost and undone am I just am I just a
[48:39] goat that's on the left hand I'm asking
[48:41] which one are you I tell you just as the
[48:43] prophet of God said that that Satan
[48:46] voted against you Jesus voted for you I
[48:49] ask you tonight why don't you go ahead
[48:51] and cast your vote tonight go ahead and
[48:53] cast you I'm For You Lord I am the bride
[48:56] I am Sanctified I am bone of your bone I
[48:59] am flesh oh I'm casting my vote to this
[49:02] message of the hour because I'm not
[49:04] gross groping in darkness it's an open
[49:06] book
[49:08] test oh Hallelujah so the prophet of God
[49:10] he's taken Malachi 45 Luke 1730 1
[49:14] Thessalonians 4:17 Matthew 25 Zechariah
[49:18] 4:17 Isaiah 60 Joel 2:25 all these
[49:21] promises all these
[49:23] descriptions that the Saints for Ages
[49:26] were probing for prophets had spoken the
[49:28] word the Saints oh they were look up
[49:31] your Redemption draw they were looking
[49:32] for the hour that we are now
[49:35] living oh let us be
[49:37] glad and rejoice for the marriage of the
[49:41] Lamb has come I'm asking you where are
[49:43] you going to be married are you waiting
[49:45] for some ceremony in the sky I say
[49:48] Malachi 4:5 has come to perform the
[49:51] wedding ceremony if you can recognize
[49:54] his presence amen amongst us I wonder
[49:57] are we sufficiently impressed with the
[49:59] word amongst
[50:02] us oh my we got to be married to another
[50:06] we got a lot of baggage we got a lot of
[50:08] things of the world we got a lot of
[50:09] things on our mind Weighing on
[50:12] us but this message has come that you
[50:16] might be married to another oh without
[50:18] this message don't you understand you
[50:21] you couldn't even uh divorce that first
[50:23] nature right
[50:26] it took a kinsman redeemer to say She's
[50:29] Mine you can't have her it wasn't legal
[50:33] in the first place because I put the
[50:35] predestinated uh ring of predestination
[50:38] on her finger before I even formed the
[50:41] world
[50:43] Hallelujah let us be glad let us rejoice
[50:46] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[50:49] well maybe this might not be speaking to
[50:51] your heart but we'll move a little bit
[50:53] further let the great physician come and
[50:55] start to deal with your heart deal with
[50:57] your mind deal with the complexes and
[51:00] the hardships and the family issues and
[51:02] the thing that you're going to look all
[51:04] things are possible right now you don't
[51:06] got to wait for it tomorrow we got
[51:07] testimony amongst us of a husband that
[51:09] had been Wayward but God rich in Mercy
[51:12] answering prayers and seeking out that
[51:14] lost seed God the presence of God came
[51:17] into the room and said you're
[51:19] mine oh hallelujah it's going home time
[51:23] are you Rapture Ready
[51:26] are you Rapture Ready I ain't talking
[51:29] about just being ready I ain't talking
[51:31] about being Pentecostal ready I screamed
[51:33] I danced I shouted well what' you get
[51:36] about it I'm talking about being Rapture
[51:38] Ready I'm talking about being married to
[51:41] the king of King being married to the
[51:43] Lord Of Glory
[51:45] am oh praise His Wonderful Name the
[51:48] prophet of God would say in the voice of
[51:50] the sign he said that John the Baptist
[51:53] was a sign of Jesus coming he said it's
[51:56] a sign of
[51:59] preparation are you catching that
[52:01] now what is he
[52:03] saying he's saying that Elijah spirit
[52:07] it's a sign of his coming it's a sign of
[52:21] preparation that Elijah
[52:24] spirit Malachi 4:5 what is it doing it's
[52:28] preparing you it's showing you the
[52:31] things that have been fulfilled the
[52:32] things that are being fulfilled now
[52:34] things that are going to be it's it's
[52:36] it's a it's a voice of
[52:38] preparation and what was that voice of
[52:40] preparation John saying repent the
[52:43] Kingdom of Heaven is ahead look the
[52:44] voice is still the same it's a voice of
[52:47] preparation repent the Kingdom of Heaven
[52:49] is at hand you must be born
[52:52] again you got to be born again you you
[52:55] got to be married to
[52:56] another there there's an expectation or
[52:59] a preparation that Malachi 4:5 is giving
[53:02] unto the Bride of Jesus Christ it's not
[53:05] an expectation of another age see that's
[53:08] the problem where the church gets a lot
[53:09] of their Pro their problems from they
[53:11] start looking unto a glare of another
[53:13] age and then that becomes their
[53:15] expectation oh my I even think about
[53:17] looking about by my dad our pastor's
[53:19] testimony when he came in back in the
[53:21] 60s and and the 70s it might seem like
[53:23] there was a great move and and people
[53:25] were were coming out all over and I
[53:27] start to think my I wish I could live
[53:29] back there I feel like I feel like
[53:31] everybody's you know it's just swn over
[53:34] and you you're gleaning during this
[53:36] Harvest time you go out and you try to
[53:38] witness and and nobody hear it and all
[53:40] of a sudden I start looking back to the
[53:42] very beginning well it have been nice to
[53:44] live there and oh I back there in Joel
[53:46] 228 when it first broke out there back
[53:48] on 1906 on auu Street wouldn't that be
[53:51] wonderful to go back there and all of a
[53:53] sudden if you start to put your expect
[53:55] expectation on an age gone by you're
[53:57] going to go backwards instead of forward
[53:59] but I want to say our expectation has
[54:01] been set by Malachi 45 just like he said
[54:04] at the very beginning of invisible union
[54:06] he said I'm not looking for Revival in
[54:08] this generation he says I'm looking for
[54:10] the coming of the Lord in this
[54:12] generation now don't get that backwards
[54:14] the prophet of God was not doing away
[54:16] with Revival but what he was wanting you
[54:18] to do is say Look Away to Jesus your
[54:20] Revival isn't some church Revival your
[54:22] Revival isn't some Pentecostal meeting
[54:24] and outpouring of the spirit that falls
[54:26] on the just and the unjust but what he
[54:28] was telling you is your Revival is in
[54:30] the coming of the lord your Revival is
[54:32] in the seventh seal your Revival is in
[54:35] the third pole your Revival is in the
[54:37] opening of the word that Christ has come
[54:39] down there is your Revival oh let us be
[54:42] glad let us rejoice for the marriage of
[54:45] the Lamb has that is your
[54:49] Revival we got to be married to another
[54:52] it's a voice of preparation getting you
[54:54] ready Rapture Ready let's turn in our
[54:56] Bibles to Matthew 3 this is me going
[55:07] slow Matthew 3 would say like this
[55:11] forgive me
[55:13] interpreters let you catch your breath
[55:15] as I do mine for this is
[55:20] that which was spoken by the prophet
[55:23] Isaiah say in the voice of one crying in
[55:26] the wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[55:30] Lord make his path straight so here's
[55:33] that voice of
[55:37] preparation what I'm preparing you now
[55:40] I'm coming and telling you
[55:42] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[55:45] hand the king is now coming we we got to
[55:48] make the valleys uh level and and the
[55:51] and the the the the mountains low we we
[55:54] got to we got to make straight the path
[55:56] of the Lord for the king is coming it
[55:59] was a voice of preparation it was a sign
[56:02] of his coming it was the introduction to
[56:05] his
[56:07] presence but we got to hear the
[56:10] voice you you got to get the
[56:14] preparation because what was John's
[56:16] commission it was to introduce the
[56:20] lamb right so you you wanted to hear the
[56:24] voice of of the messenger because his
[56:26] voice was preparing you and making you
[56:29] ready that he could introduce you to the
[56:33] word made flesh dwelling among
[56:36] you so it's important for us to receive
[56:40] the instruction it's important for us to
[56:42] be taught it's important us to realize
[56:45] that this voice of preparation by the
[56:47] spirit of Elijah is actually preparing
[56:49] you and making you ready that you can go
[56:52] into higher Heights and into deeper
[56:54] depths
[56:56] but if it becomes
[56:57] theology if if it becomes
[56:59] intellectualism then it's not taking you
[57:01] anywhere it's just filling your mind
[57:04] with rules and regulations and there's
[57:06] actually no growth you just become
[57:08] puffed up and I Know It All a and
[57:11] there's really no life and no fruit
[57:13] that's evident coming out for you but we
[57:15] want to be in a place where we have a
[57:17] revelation of really what the voice of
[57:19] preparation is doing and what it's
[57:20] supposed to be doing in our
[57:23] lives yeah I was thinking about this
[57:25] voice of preparation and and years ago
[57:28] uh one of my climbers I was teaching him
[57:30] how to climb and and and and now he's
[57:33] really uh train him because we we we
[57:36] were moving into another another realm
[57:39] of professionalism it wasn't good enough
[57:41] just to maybe just to be a good climber
[57:43] and and be better than maybe the

[1:01:52] where do you think we're going
[1:01:56] see you want to know where you're going
[1:01:58] and you also want to know how you're
[1:01:59] getting
[1:02:01] there how many times have you showed up
[1:02:03] to a theme park or you went to the mall
[1:02:05] or you went somewhere and it ain't after
[1:02:07] 30 40 minutes you're like I wish I would

[1:02:19] trip or gone to an event or gone to a
[1:02:21] lunch or gone to school or gone to
[1:02:23] sports or you went somewhere and you
[1:02:25] didn't have the proper
[1:02:27] equipment look I got cut from my
[1:02:29] baseball team it really didn't do me any
[1:02:31] good I didn't realize Tri outs were on
[1:02:32] the first
[1:02:34] day laugh at me all you want cuz you
[1:02:37] knew I didn't get the voice of
[1:02:40] preparation nobody told me b w that hey
[1:02:43] if you show up to basketball or or or or
[1:02:46] baseball on the first day guess what
[1:02:48] you're going to do you're going to play
[1:02:49] basketball or baseball
[1:02:51] duh well I thought we were just
[1:02:53] reporting a home rumor or something so
[1:02:54] I'm out there in Timberland boots and
[1:02:56] the coach is over there clocking my 40
[1:02:59] tell me how I did I actually did pretty
[1:03:01] good in them Timberland boots I ran
[1:03:03] faster than a lot of other people but

[1:03:06] Levi's in a t-shirt trying out for the
[1:03:08] football team or baseball team so you
[1:03:09] know what he did he cut me cuz why I
[1:03:13] wasn't prepared I didn't hear the voice
[1:03:15] of preparation oh and if you can hear

[1:03:20] in your La get oil in your La ye must be
[1:03:23] born
[1:03:27] again so we want to just pick up that
[1:03:29] word prepared beautiful uh word out of
[1:03:33] uh uh Matthew 3 this word prepare means
[1:03:35] to make ready prepare to make a
[1:03:39] necessary
[1:03:41] preparations get everything ready
[1:03:43] figuratively it's drawn from the
[1:03:45] Oriental custom of sending on of persons
[1:03:48] on their
[1:03:49] Journeys persons to level the roads and
[1:03:51] make them passable to prepare the minds
[1:03:55] of men to give the Messiah a fit
[1:03:59] reception and a secure
[1:04:01] blessing so this is the type of
[1:04:03] preparation that we want to have get

[1:10:46] please put them swords to
[1:10:50] use don't worry you can find
[1:10:52] Hebrews
[1:10:55] I've given up to and looked in the very
[1:10:57] beginning like man why can't I find
[1:10:58] Hebrews everybody think I don't read my
[1:11:01] Bible right take your
[1:11:05] time Hebrews chapter 12 and we'll read
[1:11:08] read verse
[1:11:17] one wherefore seeing we also are
[1:11:20] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:11:22] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:11:25] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:11:27] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:11:30] that is set before us now that word
[1:11:31] patience has a great meaning it says the
[1:11:34] characteristics of a man who is not
[1:11:37] swerved from his deliberate purpose and
[1:11:40] his loyalty to Faith and piety by even
[1:11:43] the greatest trials and
[1:11:48] sufferings and the church
[1:11:52] said it's the
[1:11:55] characteristics that you're you're not
[1:11:59] swerved from from the purpose that you
[1:12:01] have been placed here
[1:12:05] for that your faithfulness to the word
[1:12:07] of God your faithfulness to the message
[1:12:11] no matter how great the trial no matter
[1:12:15] how hard the sufferings are look Satan
[1:12:18] wants to pile it on
[1:12:20] you he he wants to weigh you down he
[1:12:23] wants to distract you he wants to get
[1:12:25] you off
[1:12:29] course so then I want to ask you if if
[1:12:32] we have an
[1:12:33] adversary that that is trying to
[1:12:35] distract you he's trying to get you off
[1:12:38] course I don't know about you how many
[1:12:39] have ever got off
[1:12:41] course how do we stay on
[1:12:45] course I got a little scripture if you
[1:12:47] turn in your Bibles to Exodus 20 I
[1:12:49] believe it is
[1:12:52] 23
[1:12:54] we can get an Old Testament
[1:12:57] type here in Exodus
[1:13:01] 23 it says behold I send an angel before
[1:13:06] thee to keep thee in the way so then so
[1:13:11] how are how are we going to be kept in
[1:13:13] the way yes how are we going to stay in
[1:13:15] the way that is called Holiness how are
[1:13:18] we going to stay on this straight and
[1:13:19] narrow Highway how are we going to stay
[1:13:21] living in this Rapture age how are we
[1:13:23] going to stay Rapture Ready behold I
[1:13:26] sent an angel before thee to keep thee
[1:13:29] in the way and to bring thee Oh

[1:13:34] you in the way but to bring thee into
[1:13:37] the place which I have prepared oh this

[1:16:43] soldier went to the field remember we're
[1:16:46] laboring along the thought of how
[1:16:49] Malachi 4:5 the voice of preparation is
[1:16:51] preparing us on how to fight on how to
[1:16:54] live he what if a soldier went to the
[1:16:56] field not trained for battle but go uh
[1:16:59] go out there to dance they might be ever
[1:17:02] so good
[1:17:03] dancers but they've got to be trained to
[1:17:08] fight that's what this message is doing
[1:17:10] is it's training you on how to
[1:17:13] fight it's preparing you it's teaching
[1:17:17] you may the prophet of God would talk
[1:17:19] about sixc
[1:17:21] Smith yeah brother brand I believe in
[1:17:23] one place he says he fought 15
[1:17:25] professional fights he was 15 and0 and
[1:17:27] uh 6C Smith because he knocked out a guy
[1:17:30] in 6 seconds was his trainer and he said
[1:17:32] he'd be training him and he' just keep
[1:17:34] hitting him in the stomach he said in
[1:17:35] one place he'd even lift him up in the
[1:17:37] wall against the wall and hit him in the
[1:17:39] stomach and he say why why are you doing
[1:17:42] that to
[1:17:43] me you're about to kill
[1:17:45] me he said it'll be good for
[1:17:49] you is it why he says cuz your body has
[1:17:52] to to learn how to
[1:17:55] respond you got to be trained to be able
[1:17:58] to take the punch I got to punch you
[1:18:01] over and over again I got to hit you
[1:18:04] over and over and over again that way
[1:18:08] when you're fighting the enemy you've
[1:18:09] been trained and you've been properly
[1:18:12] taught the prophet of God said look I
[1:18:14] might got to I I might got to uh pour it
[1:18:16] over on you I might got to really lay it
[1:18:19] on you but I say oh you you got to have
[1:18:22] it that you can be able to stand the
[1:18:23] test why do the ministers keep saying
[1:18:25] that over and over why does the pastor
[1:18:27] keep down going down that line why does
[1:18:30] the Evangelist keep saying those things
[1:18:31] you got to keep being punched over and
[1:18:34] over because you're being trained you're
[1:18:36] being taught that way you can stand
[1:18:38] before the enemy and you know how to
[1:18:39] fight that you can take the punch when
[1:18:41] it comes oh some of us have got taken
[1:18:43] some pretty big punches I say praise God
[1:18:46] you still here hallelujah why because
[1:18:49] you've been trained under the angel of
[1:18:52] Malachi for that's brought you into the
[1:18:54] presence of the I am that's keeping you
[1:18:57] he's keeping you in the way to bring you
[1:18:59] into the place that he's
[1:19:02] prepared building you up into the statue
[1:19:04] of a perfect man now we just laid a
[1:19:07] little Foundation here to move into
[1:19:09] where we want to launch from so now
[1:19:12] brother brandom and invisible Union here
[1:19:14] paragraph 35 they can put that up but
[1:19:16] we're going to be addressing his text
[1:19:18] Romans 7 verse
[1:19:20] 1-4 says and Paul here is giv an
[1:19:23] illustration in our scripture about the
[1:19:25] law and Grace and illustrating it like a
[1:19:27] marriage and
[1:19:29] divorce said this passage is very
[1:19:31] seldomly preached on because it's more
[1:19:32] or less pertains like to marriage and
[1:19:34] divorce but it also pertains to a
[1:19:37] greater portion of marriage divorce of
[1:19:39] how he's trying to set an order here as
[1:19:42] a church can no more be married to the
[1:19:44] world and Christ at the same time and be
[1:19:47] legal and lawful about
[1:19:49] it you following me that could be for a
[1:19:52] woman to be living with a husband while
[1:19:55] she's got a living husband and I have my
[1:19:57] own thoughts about that and I believe
[1:19:58] that the what the Bible says is the
[1:20:00] truth now I believe also it's my belief
[1:20:02] that this unfolds one of the great
[1:20:04] mysteries of
[1:20:07] Prophecy what are you talking about
[1:20:09] Prophet what are you talking about Paul
[1:20:12] he's talking about you he's talking
[1:20:15] about the elect lady he's talking about
[1:20:18] one of the great mysteries of prophecies
[1:20:22] concerning the
[1:20:23] bride in lady OA that would be trapped
[1:20:28] here come
[1:20:31] on does it sound
[1:20:35] familiar you didn't do it in the first
[1:20:37] place you were trapped into
[1:20:39] it so now our text is Romans 4 it says
[1:20:41] wherefore my brethren you also become
[1:20:43] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[1:20:46] that ye should be married to another
[1:20:49] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:20:51] that we should bring forth for fruit
[1:20:53] unto God so we just work quickly here he
[1:20:56] says in paragraph 153 so to be married
[1:21:00] to the second son to to the second Adam
[1:21:03] Christ the word you must separate
[1:21:06] yourself by Death from your first
[1:21:10] denominational
[1:21:12] husband cuz there isn't one of them that
[1:21:15] can take all the word of God everything
[1:21:20] outside of the message of the is a
[1:21:24] substitute everything outside of the
[1:21:27] message of the hour is a substitute and
[1:21:30] I want to tell you your first
[1:21:32] denominational husband and and we could
[1:21:34] we could go different ways with this and
[1:21:36] talk about the age because I want to say
[1:21:38] the denominational husband to the age of
[1:21:40] Lady OA is
[1:21:43] Pentecostalism and that first husband
[1:21:45] will always be back there trying to
[1:21:47] press itself back into a place of
[1:21:49] influence again it'll try to offer you a
[1:21:52] glare from another age try to tantalize
[1:21:54] you with Things From Another age and try
[1:21:57] to get you to drift back into that
[1:22:00] marriage oh with a denominational
[1:22:02] husband but that thing's got to be
[1:22:04] dead and your first husband is a
[1:22:07] denominational Spirit it can be ever so
[1:22:12] religious oh what are you talking about
[1:22:14] brother
[1:22:16] Matthew well hello
[1:22:19] Kane couldn't get no more religious than
[1:22:22] that you think your Works has done
[1:22:24] anything for you ask Cain about that
[1:22:26] there's only one way and that's by
[1:22:28] Revelation faith is a revelation my
[1:22:31] sheep hear my voice and another they
[1:22:35] ain't going to
[1:22:37] follow your first husband gots to
[1:22:41] die look look look look at Matthew

[1:23:59] witnessed to uh uh before I was marriage
[1:24:01] and married and and even once thank you
[1:24:05] love for putting up with that we're
[1:24:07] witnessing to somebody they came and
[1:24:08] lived with us for a few months because I
[1:24:10] wanted them to receive what I had we had
[1:24:12] ran together out in the world and one of
[1:24:14] my friends he came and lived with me uh
[1:24:16] before I was married he lived with me
[1:24:17] for eight months man he he went to the
[1:24:20] church and he entered into
[1:24:22] into the
[1:24:24] services even the this was in Arizona
[1:24:27] even the pastor there even had him speak
[1:24:29] at one of the uh uh uh Services of his
[1:24:32] testimony and give his testimony to the
[1:24:34] people and I remember a good sister uh
[1:24:37] was starting to talk to them and and
[1:24:39] they they were uh starting to talk and
[1:24:41] everything and and and it just bugged me
[1:24:44] to no
[1:24:47] end because I knew he was riding on my
[1:24:51] coattails
[1:24:52] I knew he had come in and had just
[1:24:54] grafted his way
[1:24:56] in he was living a Victorious Life he
[1:25:00] was drug free and alcohol free he was
[1:25:03] enjoying the benefits of the spirit he
[1:25:06] was moving in the camps he was moving in
[1:25:08] the service everything was all right
[1:25:10] until I said hey buddy it's time for you
[1:25:12] now to go out and get on your
[1:25:14] own and then when the punches
[1:25:17] came he had never been married to
[1:25:21] another and it was just like that he was
[1:25:23] back to drugs and alcohols and it wasn't
[1:25:25] months later I was preaching his funeral

[1:25:36] your
[1:25:37] life now we know god holds it all in the
[1:25:39] hand that you're predestined but there
[1:25:41] got to be something in your heart that
[1:25:43] wants to be pleasing to the Lord that
[1:25:46] wants to have complete and total
[1:25:49] deliverance from that first husband that
[1:25:52] F I hate that guy I hate him I want him

[1:26:18] them around because we like the
[1:26:20] entertainment we like that part we like

[1:32:47] 2:16 we'll keep pressing we'll bring
[1:32:49] this somewhere to a close short
[1:32:52] 216 now invisible
[1:32:55] Union that'd be a good place to stop
[1:32:59] but
[1:33:01] ah I want to invite the musicians but I
[1:33:03] don't want them to sit there for 15
[1:33:04] minutes
[1:33:06] again paragraph 26 now you but when you
[1:33:09] were separated from that Union by
[1:33:12] spiritual death oh yeah come on we're
[1:33:15] we're going somewhere real quick hang in
[1:33:17] there now you but when you were
[1:33:20] separated from that Union by spiritual
[1:33:22] death your natural desires is to cut
[1:33:24] your hair your natural desire is to wear
[1:33:26] shorts paint your face your natural
[1:33:28] desire is to be intellectual smart man
[1:33:30] know something better than the other
[1:33:32] that's what Eve wanted that's the very
[1:33:34] thing she
[1:33:35] wanted look if you're professing the
[1:33:37] message if you're professing to be be a
[1:33:39] believer but you're living contrary to
[1:33:42] the word I want to tell you you are
[1:33:43] living in spiritual
[1:33:46] adultery now now don't don't get upset
[1:33:50] don't be alarmed
[1:33:53] because God rich in Mercy solved your
[1:34:01] problem he solved your problem he rigged
[1:34:04] this
[1:34:07] thing so that you have a way
[1:34:11] out see your natural desire is to be
[1:34:14] intellectual the lust of the flesh the
[1:34:16] pride of life the lust of the
[1:34:20] eye right
[1:34:23] yeah I don't want to detour but we we
[1:34:26] could we could use the type not only in
[1:34:29] the flesh but in the
[1:34:30] spiritual that's why the prophet of God
[1:34:32] said that in the beginning say I'm not
[1:34:34] looking for Revival in this generation
[1:34:36] I'm looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:34:39] is because he was wanting the the the
[1:34:40] bride to know where to look it's not
[1:34:43] it's not a public
[1:34:45] show he said I will meet you in
[1:34:50] there and that that same message right
[1:34:53] after that I believe in paragraph 46
[1:34:55] when he says that he says now watch when
[1:34:57] the bride starts to line herself up with
[1:34:59] the word he says then the Revival will
[1:35:02] come
[1:35:03] forward so he's not doing away with the
[1:35:06] Revival but the Revival is in the third
[1:35:08] pool that isn't that that isn't a public
[1:35:10] show it's the coming of the Lord he
[1:35:13] comes as a thief in the night this isn't
[1:35:15] the first part of Revelation where he
[1:35:17] comes in a cloud and all eyes will see
[1:35:19] him and behold him that is not are
[1:35:21] coming this is the coming of a thief in
[1:35:24] a night that nobody knows about it that
[1:35:26] it's a secret invisible Union between
[1:35:29] Christ the anointed word for the age and
