Description:
The Faith of God Moving In Us
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Wednesday Evening Service (LIVE)
Christian Life Tabernacle
February 28, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in th sight oh Lord my strength My Redeemer anything that I say right now is it's just all just to lift up the name of Jesus Christ my sufficiency is not of myself to think anything as of myself but my sufficiency is of God and him alone it is because of him that I move and Bre and breathe and have the abilities in my being I nothing but with him and in him I can do all things through Christ strengthens him today is my birthday um it's the same I mean just just the fact that I can say that and I'm turned 52 today and most my family and people that know me say it's a miracle that I'm still here today and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that can say that and uh you know it's also the same day that the cloud the picture of the cloud was taken so that has a very uh personal meaning to me you know when it comes to the message and my place in it um yes God bless um January 16th 2006 is my new birthday um I met the Arthur um Jesus Christ himself at the time I was I was I I I was done with Christianity I was done with church I had studied every religion it is that I could come in contact with and um when they went left I went left and um after my experience in January um one of my first acts of repentance was the return to prison because I was on the run and while I was in prison uh 9 years prior to this this time I met uh brother Rex Taylor and uh brother Johnny Smith in I was in prison again before and uh then nine years later I I returned back to a prison and uh brother Johnny was by himself and he was preaching um the nine years before then I told him I said man I want what you got it was just something about him and brother Rex then you know I just saw something different and so and so that's that's where after my new new birth and I come in contact with the message and uh and I I never find error I've never it's never left me and and it's because of this message that I'm here today it's it's it has kept me it has kept my wife and I together and when when I should when we shouldn't be together you know by only by the grace of God and uh I just just just for a minute just my wife is is the kind of Christian that I want to be like she's the greatest person that I know in the world and uh um and so um I just I was born brown my last name was brown I was adopted um um and uh by my stepdad so I could take on the the last the so I could take on the letters hm um it's just the way it happened wouldn't um so these things that we learn in the I learn they so significant to me because I see you know the numbers um my dad turned 72 this year that was the year I was born in 72 um and and so I um I had a a testim I mean testimon a testim but I had something that came up on my heart that I wanted to share but it was because of my complexes that I developed um about you know I've I was raised a proper child my parents were rich I had everything you could dream of I had to wear shirt suit and tie to school every day in public school I got picked up by kids all all most of my most of my child but once I become got older and uh I begin to realize who I was then it didn't bother me anymore I just let him talk and say I still pop my collar anyway um um and uh and so uh because of that I have is hindered me from you know the way I worship the way I praise SC or telling testimonies and you might say wow I can imagine what it's like if you was really free but but uh you know so I have I'm learning to let that go and just say hey you can think whatever you want to think about me that's right I know who I am God made me I didn't make myself you know so um and so and I I promise God that if he made way for me to make it here today on my birthday um which is I was born in a leap year this is another leap here so I'm just taking a leap of faith by and uh and uh and uh and I told him I said I would tell my little testimony that bit on my heart if he made a way so I had a doctor's appointment last Thursday and they they the doctor denied he wanted to see me so when it came up he was like well what day you want and I thought thirsday cuz that way I ain't got to get up so early I get up at 3:00 every morning it don't matter what time what go I go to bed but I be I get up in the morning at the same time but I can go back to sleep and take you know because I'll be up late so you know it's the pressed to get you know to church on Wednesday nights I and then I'm going this some of it lazy too I just be honest you know what I mean cuz I'm here today and I pressed my way to get here today so just I just you know just pray for me that I get that lazy off my behind and get up and come to church on Wednesday night and stay for second service um so I let to say I just tell my testimony um it's a trip cuz the the last time I was standing up here and I told a little testimony it it had to do with it had the dealing with the same person and with brother Manassa and um we we communicate from time to time um we just keep him him and his wife in prayer um I'm so happy for them and what they got going on and um so he had he had flew home he had flew to Louisville to surprise his wife for de for her wedding shower and so on his way back so he called me when he got back home he said he said uh um he he called me like this is not he know I was asleep but I just so Happ my phone was on and I answered you know I answered it and um and so he said man I just got something I just got to tell you he said I was on my way he said and I fell asleep on the plane he said and and he said I had a dream the ground start shaking the ground started shaking he say um he say U he said he heard brother brownon voice speak real loud and said the train is coming the train is coming and uh he said the ground like a earthquake and he on his way to California and he say um he say um and and then I guess he woke up so this is what he tells me so immediately I sent him a great quote you know uh about the train you know when brother Brown say put your peanuts down and you going to miss the train get your luggage you going to miss the train the train is in the blocks so you know I sent that to him you know like I'm you know speaking to him not realizing that he called me to tell me something like God was trying to tell me something so on my way from on my way to work every morning I crossed like three train track so this the next morning I went and I crossed one train track nothing I ain't think nothing about it I crossed the next train track and right when I got to it the lights came on and I was like wow you know I did Brother Manasses just tell me about this but it just really just didn't stick I was like man that's God trying to speak but I ain't really so I get to the last train track and right when I get ready to go under the train track the arm start coming down and I went under and the car behind me had to stop and right then you know God said put them peanuts down you know we think you know we think like okay I work I sweep leaves I make peanuts compared to somebody that work at that fly planes or something like that it's peanuts so peanuts to me is you know anything of the world it ain't nothing that we could obtain in this world that's more precious yeah than than than this word than this message yeah you know and holding on to whatever your peanuts are whatever my peanuts are and I had some peanuts that I was chewing on that I need to put down I you know and and so and so right then it spoke to me and and man I just started spitting out peanuts and putting peanuts down in my life and and putting peanuts down here and peanuts here and there here and there down and then you know just one thing behind the other to where to where to where you know even the message that's been going across this ain't what I was going to say but I'm sorry I don't know brother Matthew um it was a brother here preaching I wasn't here I was in West Virginia it was a brother came preaching preach several uh services and uh this is when it all just started just get the trainers in the blocks and the brother preached and the Saturday service I had to work that Sunday so I got up that morning and I streamed the service and the brother was preaching and after the brother was preaching brother Matthew got up and he began to kind of you know kind of Minister what he was saying and he was talking about the rain the rain is pouring the spirit and I was outside listening at work and all of a sudden the rain just started coming down man I just started crying Lord you know I I I need to touch I need to touch so that we worked that Sunday and then I so I CAU the ser that Su in the same Minister were preaching he preaching about his wife she had some kind of condition and she was on her way to church y'all know what I'm talking about she was on her way to church and it was just a Mir but whatever happened to her that day the same thing happened to me while I was listening to it in service and so from that moment up until now you know God is you know you you you just get to I got to a point to where I had I had victory I had Victory when I come back from West Virginia I mean West Virginia was the hardest job I've ever had to face in my life it's getting I don't know if you know it's like to be hated when you get out the truck every day and cussed that and talk back and you know treated like a dog every day and I just you know I I sucked it up so I come home Victoria but I was wounded when I got back and just got in a stagnant position man I'm tell you when Manassa called and God said put them peanuts down and the train is in the block the train is in the block and the service has just been going on you know what I mean and uh Brother David talk about you know skitzing you know I I'm skitzing right now when when when when when when the supernatural take place and just the fact that I'm here and able to say anything to anybody this is the most Supernatural moment I've ever experienced in my life I'm stop uh and I just want to say that I love every last one of y'all and I don't have no heart feeling against nobody in this room and y'all got what I want y'all got what I want I chase what you got I learn how to worship the god that's inside of you my pastor told me that and I believe every last one

Every ch Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every hallelujah praise the Lord for his testimonies yes I just so enjoyed that testimony I just believe it's part of the heartbeat of God for the service tonight you know God has broken chains that's how many how many here want God to break some more chance cuz if he's done it for one person he'll do it again if we come on the same approach that's right amen praise the Lord let's bow our hearts together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we stand before your purchased bride Lord we lord we know that Lord within ourselves Lord there's no good thing Lord and surely we've come because you said to come Lord you said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden Lord and I'll give you rest Lord and So based on your word of invitation Lord here we are each one of us believing that Lord it was you who spoke it wasn't man it wasn't our thinking but it was your word that drawing us to yourself father and as we come to you tonight Lord we pray that you would take the words Lord that you've planted in My Heart Lord and may you multiply it Lord as Only You Can Do Lord surely a man can do nothing but Lord in your hands Lord you you can do all things and so father we're entrusting to you by the grace of God that when we leave here Lord that you would have nourished Us by spiritual food that was stored up father for the benefit of the believer and for your kingdom Lord that you would be lifted up once again we're committing every need and ourselves to your great hand in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord how many happy to be in the house of the Lord so good to see each one of you and we trust the Lord will bless you little thought we had on our heart I don't believe we'll be very long but uh we'll just commit ourselves to the Lord here and believe he has something special maybe if you want to turn with me we can open I'm going to go to Proverbs chapter 15 read a few scripture verses and um see if the Lord will help put the thought to your heart I can see the picture but it's really going to take God to anoint us together you know it's I've heard it said brother brandham said that Satan I believe it was in uh Faith versus wisdom he said you know Satan anoints Humanity to disbelieve but God anoints his Believers to believe the word amen and that great battle is Raging within us in Proverbs 15 we'll go to verse 33 we have a few scriptures we want to get to and um kind of bounce back and forth but just trust that the Lord will be your portion so there in uh Proverbs chapter 15 in verse 32 it says he that refuseth instruction def despise his own soul but but he that heareth reproof GTH understanding the fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility amen amen you may have your seats the um brother brandham said in perfect faith I believe it was he said that Jesus Christ overcome by the word of God in humility and as the scripture says there that the fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honor is humility I love the wisdom of God to give us what we have need of when he made these promises and there in chapter 16 we'll read a few more verses there it says the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of a tongue is from the Lord all the ways of a man are clean and in his own eyes but the Lord weth the spirits commit thy ways unto the Lord and thy thoughts shall be established the Lord hath made all things for himself yay even the wicked for the day of evil everyone that is proud in heart is in an Abomination to the Lord though hand join in hand he shall not go be unpunished by Mercy and truth and iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men depart from Evil when a man's ways please the Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him you know that's that's your identification we're reading your identification this is wonderful amen over also in Revelations chapter 3 a very familiar scripture um we'll just read there it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will Su with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also over came and him sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and one more last scripture I I so enjoyed this when I read it today in Daniel chapter 6 J Daniel chapter 6 is you know one of the things that just we're in this great battle and as Brother David was preaching you know he was talking this past weekend and I kind of listened to some of it today again and I was like my goodness it just seems like if I can only catch up you know sometimes you know you're you're just asking and seeking and God's been so merciful to open the understanding but you know he has what he knows what we have need of he knows the season that we're in and he's faithful and uh in Daniel uh chapter 6 verse1 it says and it pleased Darius to set over the kingdom and hundred 20 princes which should be over the whole Kingdom and it's one of those things in in verse three it says then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and the princes because an excellent Spirit was in him and the King thought to set him over the whole realm and there in um paragraph 5 it says this then said the men we should not find any occasion against Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God you know I just thought that was amazing and just like our brother testified today he wants the same experience that he sees resounding out in you and I believe that Daniel was like that he was there was a testimony of the resurrected God living out in in a shadow through Daniel he had an Excell in spirit that other people looked at him and said you know what you know we we could take an occasion but you know what at the end of the day the the thing is is what you're standing for is what people are against it's the word of God right you know and a lot of times you know they had a accusation or they wanted to accuse but then at the end of it it's because no he had an excellent Spirit but it was actually his God that they had a problem with oh my think about the things that you and I stand for that's the big that's the big Todo you know you're just the target you know and but it's really the message that you're packing that they want to attack you know and and uh I just before I kind of launch out on my thought but you know something that was said in uh perfect faith that it just seems to be something that the Lord kind of brings back to me because I want it to be a reality and not just to me because something the prophet said and and I believe it's our possession and so if we just keep preaching it and believe in it then God will make it a reality amen but he says this in perfect Faith he says but and then this is in paragraph 67 he says but as long as you're doing things that are wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you see you can you'll automatically know that you're wrong you'll automatically put yourself back there a sinner by by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart condemns you you know you know you're a Believer let me read that one more time he says but when you when your heart don't condemn you all right you know you're a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can ask whatever you will and know that it'll be given because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing that you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are Jesus had faith in the word of God that he said what he said it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all things I am that I am and he knew that with perfect Faith that's what we're looking for that substantives perfect faith and he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I in myself do nothing but it is my faith in God and God was in him the word made not the word made manifest and when the the word of God comes in you it is manif made manifest for you are a Believer I love this definition of a Believer and I really hope that this anchors down in our heart and it becomes a vision that we live by but he says a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you and I like that he says I like it when you I like to teach it where and how what faith really is amen that's what I want I want what faith really really is I don't want it just to be a concept I wanted something bubbling up like a fountain he said that when he comes he would be that rivers of living water pouring out of us amen surely we got this thing that we're battling but oh my there's something inside that can pour out by a faith of God that's living in US yes oh my that's perfect Faith a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you and that's what I want to speak to you a little bit about tonight is the faith of God that moves in you amen we want to see the faith of God moving in us we don't want to see our fears moving in us we want to see the faith of God moving in US surely we've seen what the experience and the product of what our fear does it brings things into picture just like it did with Abraham Abraham the things he feared brought it to pass so as the enemy is trying to anoint us with all these fears and complexes and doubts we we want to cast him out we want to put him behind us and take this word and put it in our heart and put it on our lips and watch the faith of God come into action that's the way God wants us he wants to take his word believe it expect it to come to pass you know Faith Masters every circumstance why are you in the circumstances you are tonight because there's a faith of God to come and master the situation there's no big problem or little problem to God he says the faith is the victory you have been given access to the kingdom by faith oh my you talk about a dynamite power you talk about this kind of love that creates faith that I'm a part of God's kingdom I look what I was I look I listen to the testimonies what we were some love hand brought us out so that it creates a confidence that God's going to use me right he ain't done with us yet there's more exploits for us to do you know just uh as my title went out I I also want to just talk a little subject about overcoming the critics you know one of the greatest enemies I got and he's my worst critic I look at him every day in the mirror right I walk with him he he talks to my conscience he's there ridiculing me he's a religious guy he'll take the law and try to beat me up with it he does the same thing with you sir so we're fighting a fight of faith and we're trying to let go of the reasoning power and the effect of it in our lives but the only thing that can break that and have the power of transformation rise up within us is the love of God and the faith in his word amen it's by grace through faith are we saved amen my praise the Lord you know I I was thinking about what to share and how to share it on my heart and I was at my desk and I saw this little paper and I pulled it out and I have a little artist that sometimes would drop me little nuggets and it's such an inspiration you know God uses you know loved ones and friends to really encourage you you know when you feel discouraged or you're going through something difficult you know we have a way to encourage one another you know you're the you're the Difference Maker for somebody you know the enemy is trying to get you so so caught up and me so caught up in our daytoday woe is me that we can't encourage somebody else but God wants to use us he wants to use our heart that pulsates with the love of God with the faith of God but Oh my he wants to keep us looking down down down but oh my you know and it's um I don't know exactly where she got it from but you know it's true and this is a little drawing and a little artwork but it says wisdom and discouragement come from the same Fountain words are like a snowflake on the beach gone before you know that they were there but they leave a permanent Mark who you say them to so truly think before you speak you know I think of the the scripture that says out of the mouths of babes you know and then it just so happens that I was listening to a message called the message of the Le Sean church and it says this it says that's the way it is in my text tonight it isn't the paper that it's wrote on or it isn't the size of the text but what's wrote on it it's the word of the Living God it's so essential till all the heavens and earth will pass away but it shall never pass away see God notices every little word that we read he knows every little thought that's going through your mind every little act that we do so and I'm kindly thinking I'm kind of thinking this and many times the church in its looseness gets to going or doing things and thinking things and taking these just as they are are we ought to weigh them so what we do and say we ought to think it over before we speak it my my old southern mamy used to tell me think twice and speak once it's the little things sometimes that we leave undone that means so much to us we get into such a hurry to race over things in this neurotic age that we live in it would behoove us as the church of God tonight to stop and wait a minute and see where we're at well I thought that was great wisdom and I just was so blessed that you know it's it's part of our faith to to you know when something comes up and the battle's on and you're facing your schoolmate or someone says something I mean it's time to wait on the Lord you know we don't have to be an impulsive people you know he he told me I'll give him a piece of my mind that's like our first response but he says now why don't we think twice you know I mean let's give God his due and he says seeky first like hey if the scripture doesn't come first and that carnal mind's dropping the load on us we can we don't have to jump at his every beckoning move we can wait on the Lord we can say God what is your idea on the matter you know that takes time that takes waiting on the Lord oh but you know we we're living in such an age where there's this neurotic tensions this nervous tensions it's like hey what is your what's your thing on this right now like what you you got to have an answer now we ain't waiting you feel the Press you feel the pressure but on my we have another source you know we have an advocate with the father we can just pause and say father was that you oh I think about brother brandham when he was over there and he was going to Egypt or Palestine you know is it he knew who he was right but oh he said it's not time yet he said wait a minute they're all pulling me this way they're all come on if they see the sign of the Messiah think about where you and me would if he just would have taken that thought of somebody saying come on come on brother brandom but then God said no it's not time he said wait a minute and he went to the side and he said was that you Lord oh my what an example my we should take time amen faith is a master of every circumstance praise God you know I find that in my own Christian walk and I know that everybody who's a Christian will go through the battle and you know one thing that I take courage in is how that you know brother Brandon would make a statement and it just it changes your whole world you know when it becomes your promise when it becomes something that you know you you it's life to you right all of the sudden you know complexes you know indifferences things that they just they just don't affect you anymore you know and I believe that what's God is he's maturing us and bringing us to the place where he can reflect himself Amen in each one of our lives but you know there has to be a recognition that God is doing it in our lives and we have to yield to it we can't just keep going on and on the same way things were we have to stop yes and I think about the um situation and this is out of that same message uh the message and this is in 1958 you can put it up if you want this is uh June 9th the message to the latery and church age but he said sometime ago in the days of our Noble Abraham Lincoln it was told that there was a prisoner in the camp and he was sentenced to death for a federal crime that he had done and some good man went to ask the president he says won't you pardon this certain man and the President Lincoln as as all know him to be a Christian he's the man said sir you know the man's just a mortal soul and an immortal soul that he's going to take from his body would you take his life and he begged him for mercy and Mr Lincoln fixed he was fixing to get out of his Carriage he just wrote a little piece of paper I pardon this man Abraham Lincoln and then he he rushed back quickly to the prison cell and he said sir I have your pardon from the president of the United States and the Man rushed back quickly to the prison and said see oh and the man looked at him and he said uh if this was a real pardon it would be on a great paper with this seal and it wouldn't have it would have like gold letters and you come and that it come from the president he said why do you make fun of me and know that I am going to be shot in the mornings at Sunrise he said I'm not making fun of you sir I've got Abraham's signature on it think of it think of the battle think of what's being presented to him he says wait a minute you're making fun of me it has to be a certain way for it to be something that will bring my Deliverance my pardon my eternal life it's got to be something more than this Lord he says oh he said this is just enough for me to believe it and he refused to receive it and he was shot the next morning now there is a pardon at large wrote by Abraham Lincoln to this certain person was to be pardoned on this day and the firing squad killed him the next day and he was tried in federal court and here is the decision a pardon is not a pardon except it be received as a pardon and this is God's word that I have read just read it's a pardon to those who will accept it as a pardon it's healing to those who will accept it as healing it could be any great blessing that God has promised if we will believe it and accept it as such no matter what size it is what kind of book it's written on as long as it's God's eternal etal word amen I love that oh my and this is a very strange thing when when a man's knocking at the door to be in the scriptures he says I just forget the artist names who painted it the famous picture of Jesus knocking at the door he says I can't call his name and I was interested so I looked and his name was William uh Holman hunt and it's a very interesting I don't know how many have seen it but he's standing there knocking on the door and he's you know leaning in and oh my just it's amazing but he says this he says um now he says all great pictures before they can be hung in the Hall of Fame they have to go through the hall of critic first and then it just reminds me of the church before the church can ever be taken to Glory it has to go through the world this world of criticisms criticism and sometimes we try to Sher and pull back from criticism well that's only testing it's the golden nuggets to you it's something that God has permitted you to to try you to to bring you through a 100% pure shining gold oh my now we're talking the Hall of critics but oh my we got to go through it that's the Church of the Living God that's the hour we're in you know my says but sometimes we try to Sherk and pull back from criticism well that's only the testing amen all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution says the scripture so the criticism we welcome that because that's what we have to have to put us through the fiery trials so that this artist when the picture was going through the the Hall of critics there was one critic said sir I think the portrait of Christ is beautiful and I think standing at the door this fine anticipation of him watching and waiting that some one would open but said there was one thing wrong that is that you haven't got a a latch for him to go in at he says and the artist says oh I painted it thus my you see in this case the latch is on the inside you must do the opening Christ does the knocking and that's the way it is with every person here tonight that's seeking God for anything he is knocking at the door but you have to open up you are the one that's under control you are the in inside to O you are on the inside to open the door amen oh I love that you know you you talk about God empowering his church he's just sitting there knocking knocking knocking and he gives us so many opportunities there's so many things that we have need of oh my you can't you can't even rise in the morning without him and he's knocking every morning saying I have mercy for you this morning oh my no I'm just I'm just going through this thing I I'll work it out oh my reminds me I was thinking about the woman at the well how she when she came and she was like well you know woman bring me a drink he said she's she's looking at him like well you don't have nothing to draw with like how many times do we do that to God like you know you you don't really know and you don't have the ability to draw out of my situation oh my we criticize oh my this is another quote that he says an identified Masterpiece of God you know there and this is in paragraph 2:19 there's where he become the Masterpiece for us just remember all Masterpiece pieces before they can ever be put in the Hall of Fame they have to go through the Hall of critics first the critics has to see if they can criticize it but when it stands the criticism it's took to the Hall of Fame God's son passed through the critics of every organization denomination even till pilate said I find no fault in him Judas said I betrayed innocent blood and God raised him up and he hangs in the great Halls of Fame today at the right hand of God making intercession don't you want to join him there don't you want to be a part of that amen you can be you're invited to be while we're singing this song Don't you want to just talk it over with him and you know I was listening to you know conference with God today and you know I believe that's what God wants us to do every day and you know in every situation I believe he's knocking and and he's pleading with us you know there's so many things that try to pull our affections away from the lovely one there's so many natural carnal things that is drawing us off sides you know but oh my he's worthy of it all he's worthy to give everything that we have and give him the time I think about you know if someone was knocking at your door and all of a sudden you know you opened up the door and it was that you know famous ball player you idolize or if it was if you're in you know college and it's this awesome Professor that teaches everybody that never gets any B's or C's you know and you're like wow he's come to my house oh you would welcome him in you would say Come on come check I just got some new coffee you know or whatever you like you would if he asked you for anything in your house you'd be like please hey take it I just got a new code hey yeah you're welcome to it matter of fact we're the same take it oh my but Jesus Christ is standing there knocking and he wants to come in but see he's not like a man he actually coming because he wants to give us something he has something for us amen he has a message he wants to deliver to you amen I think that's wonderful my we got to go through the Hall of critics who who wants to be criticized nobody nobody wants to be criticized but in the criticism you know uh uh uh criticism is not always just the negative you know these people who are the the ones that go through I don't know all their responsibility but I can imagine you know they go to these uh great Galleries and they they're trained they're taught they they know like this picture it has to have this kind of rendering from this kind of artist they're trained to discern and know to criticize it to the very finest detail you know and that's just like refining gold yeah you know or looking at Gold you have to be able to discern the good and the bad oh and I thank God for what that cloud represents amen oh he when he came oh you know there's there's a great significance with that cloud he calls you he says I no longer call you church but I call you bride amen oh my that's a criticism I receive amen it's an honor God you're not just calling us Church Church you're calling us bride that's an individual Affair every single one of us it's not a church Affair it's a bride Affair you in Christ my you know the devil he knows us better than we know ourselves he knows our weaknesses he's been studying Humanity for 6,000 years and he knows what triggers us oh my but the faith of God when you truly are in fellowship with God and you know you're his you know that you were with him before the foundation of the world Amen you know that somehow God Drew you to himself and you're in his hands right when the criticism comes you know what I think it's really important sometimes to evaluate criticism based on who it comes from right you know and that's where it gets difficult sometimes when your daddy or your mommy or your best friend starts saying stuff all of a sudden we're immediately weighing out that it's the truth and you know what that can do if you accept a lie as the truth you know what it will do it'll cause death that's what it did with eeve but oh my by faith we overcome by faith we overcome criticisms it's let every man's word be a lie and God's be true heavens and earth will pass away but this word will not fail well if our discernment and our hearts could be poured out upon the promised word yes sir when the criticism comes if hey you know what if there's things that are criticisms Love's corrective right right you know we had a little garage sale this last weekend and we were all closed up it was Saturday it was early it was like we're done garage sales are fun but only for a short season you know but a man wanted to buy this Mower and this edger thing that I had for sale and he came by and all of a sudden we got to fellowshipping and uh he was telling me and I was just blown away at this man's bir and I'm like H he you know just real real uh just seems like a a real guy but he's testifying and saying that you know he he lives in um Virginia or somewhere but uh he had been applying for a job with um I don't loed Martin I believe it was and uh he just he' been applying and he got rejected and then he put his application again and he got rejected Reed and he put his application again got rejected well this had been going on for 12 years every year he was putting in his application putting in his application why is that why do you think someone would do that he he's an engineer he knows he's an engineer right he knows that he was made for a job he knows that he's needed there he was created to do that job oh and and as he's talking to me I'm just blown away like h i mean this is the kind of potentials that a Believer is supposed to have I'm a Son of God I'm a Believer my identification is that God his faith will live in me in you and here he is I just there's something in him no matter the rejection no matter how many times he was turned down and you know what he said every time he went they said well he's like well how did the interview go he's like well this this and this and it was all criticism he says so thank you thank you and then he said I'm going to go work on it I mean just simple so I don't need that job I mean criticisms actually I believe it was even brother brandham that says criticisms do me so good if we'll let it but we're all so guarded you know I think about this uh there's these diseases in humanity where your own defenses actually fight against your own your own defenses it's a disorder you know sometimes we get so defensive it's actually destroying us it Wars against our testimony my let's just receive the instruction let's let God deal with our lives let's clean kick out the trash let's let God prepare us for that great train ride cuz it's coming yeah I'll take a minute and just tell a little testimony I here on Wednesday and Lord moved on my heart and you know that's how God does he moves on your heart with a burden you know and it could be some something very simple but I I have come to understand that a lot of times when God moves on you it's for someone else you know he can show you hey this is your job and different things but I was moved upon for my aunt and it just you know it was like a blind spot you know sometimes in life you got so many things that you can only deal with or or focus in on but this was like how many know what a blind spot is so if you don't drive or don't know anything about driving when you're driving you're looking at the road ahead of you okay you you can't be looking behind you cuz that'll cause a crash but there are things as you're looking because people are around you there's areas they call them blind spots okay so you don't know that if someone's traveling beside you in your blind spot so this was the case with my aunt you know her husband had been battling um a condition and it was started back in January and um you know we didn't really even go see her anything and I'm just you know in my heart I was just like Lord why you know I I felt I felt terrible but it was all in one moment as as we were in service it's like all of a sudden she came on my heart and I'm like my goodness we just heard two three weeks ago that her husband passed we didn't even go to the funeral or anything and I'm like how did I miss it oh my then I I you know I I came up here and I asked you know brother Matthew to to join with me in prayer you know and and I was just burdened like my goodness you know you you know then the enemy starts coming criticize what kind of Christian are you you know what kind of you know uh nephew are you you know you call you you all the criticisms you know and all of a sudden you know I just said you know what and brother Matthew prayed that the Lord would give the word that would bring the Comfort or something to that effect and you know the Lord made a away within a very short period of time I I was able to go see her on Monday and I am just astounded because just like what we're saying here tonight the faith of God that moves in you you know when you're burdened you you know that God's doing something right if we don't try to rehearse or pre-arrange I don't even remember all the stuff that was said but the fact is is that we were there and God said he would be there and here he was she at the end end of it after we prayed and said a few words she said this only confirms what I prayed for and her heart was comforted she was happy she said I'm not I'm not over the fact that I lost my husband but I now can move forward you know and that's what we want we want to be God's hand extended and that's what he wants to impart to us he wants to impart his faith in us so that it move us into action amen but we want to be humble when we move and that's what helps Master the circumstance amen I don't know how long I've been but it won't be much longer you know this is a something out of perfect Faith he says what he says we're coming now to Perfection we're coming to the perfection because the people has got to come to this in order for the Rapture and that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into the perfect raptured Faith look for it it means that a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we make it by the grace of God you know I think that that was a comment that brother Bram made to Wards his closing of perfect faith and I believe that's what God is waiting for the Perfection to come and we got to be looking for it there's going to be a shaving down of some things and well I don't want to be all guarded up and defensive if I got a blemish on me God bring the iron of your word let the Holy Ghost and fire burn out some wrinkles right amen you know there ain't nothing to hold me here I mean I I say that but let my actions prove it God give the anoint my faith anoint the word that your spirit can come and energize your faith that's what we want you know and I think one of the things that we go through in the great mind battle you know is this criticism you're not worthy you're not worthy you know we when we look at ourselves as a believer a lot of times that Avenue that channel of memory just and we see it like a big old database right in front of us you know you're this you're this you're this and all of that but oh my when the message says you never did that in the first place what an identification right let that become a reality let that faith move on me when I'm facing the Goliath I don't have no bread I don't have no food but oh my when we get into the Habit you know give me this daily bread and when we can really value that when God brings us just a satisfying portion like God you spoke to me and it's such a reality I'm walking in faith believing yes my you know I think about this testimony that brother brandham gave in conferences and um he says this in paragraph 54 of conference if you want to put it up he says there was an old bum was crossing the street and he looked like he had clothes that were ragged and an old hat that was tattered and a young teenage boy and girl were coming down the street making love to each other and they wasn't noticing the poor old fella and they hit him and knocked him way back up and smashed his him besides beside of a building where the fender sideswiped him and the boy turned from the girl to see the old man and he swung sideways and was crushed him on the side of the building the emergency was called and they took him over to the hospital and the city the city hospital and they looked him over and his arms were broke his legs were broke and they thought that he was unconscious and he wasn't even hardly breathing so a bunch of doctors they thought about other others they had and they said we have to hold a little conference here now the old man is nearly 70 no doubt we know we don't know who he is now now think about this dialogue okay this is reasoning at its best and you do the same thing and so do I but these doctors are great doctors and they're they're going through the whole you know thought process and so he says now he says we don't know who he is it'll take us hours after hours of our time to operate set his bones back again and try to straighten him up and the old fella doesn't have much longer to live and the O and we've got others waiting here I just don't believe it's worthwhile to do it let's just lay him back and we won't and we it won't be too much longer and he'll be gone anyway but the old man was inde dead as they thought he was and he turned himself over and he says gentlemen I've heard every word you said he said I'm worth something he said I'm worth so much that God gave His only begotten son that I would be saved he said I've received that message some 50 years ago and as passing tracks on the street and walking from place to place trying to preach the gospel he said I'm worthy of something or God wouldn't have never saved me sure you are angels of God are here I don't care what you've done though your sins be as Scarlet they'll be white like wool though they be red like Crimson they shall be white like snow let's hold a conference each each one where you're at and ask God oh Lord am I worthy am I worth anything I'm just a little housewife I'm just a farmer I just work at a feeling station I don't care what you do but you see Lord I've been evil I've made three or four shows and fail I don't care what you've done let's hold a conference through your trial he has failed though your intellects pass away God God's got a burning bush right by the seat here tonight he's got the angel that can set your heart a flame amen I love that to think about it you're worthy because there was somebody that was worthy that paid the price oh my if we can ever identify and realize I'm a Believer because somebody loved me yes somebody thought so much of me that he died for me when we come into that great criticism you say wait a minute devil huh you you might have your opinion on the matter but I'm going to tell you a different opinion and I believe this report I'm going to refuse your report you know that's what perfect Faith does when the Devil comes with his accusation you just turn him down yes sir turn him down my praise the Lord maybe I'll just uh invite the musicians I'm going to read this last quote and try to wrap it up here you know one of the criticisms you know when Jesus came he was criticized before even his birth said you know that had to have been an illegitimate birth my he was criticized before he got here all the way up till the end and the criticism was well huh we find no fault in him my but he went through the Hall of critics and that's what we're going through and this is something that uh brother brandham said in sir we would see Jesus he said could there be anything good come out of Nazareth it is a wicked City and I think Nathan gave him the best answer or or Philip rather gave him the best answer that anyone could receive he said come and see come and see for yourself now look it we could have a sermon right there oh and that man that doesn't have the audacity to come and see himself but would stand on the sideline and criticize how do you know he says old Dr Davis that ordained me in the missionary Baptist Church One Night in a debate with an Infidel he was debating with an Infidel and there was an old boy stood in the back of the building he come up with his hair hanging down his neck carving an apple and the Infidel said what do you want he said I want to ask you a question he said what is it he says is this apple sweet or sour he was eating the apple he said I don't know says I'm not eating it and that's just what I thought and went back and sat down and that settled it amen how do you know unless you've taste and see the Bible said taste and see and the poet said taste and see that the Lord is good he is a rewarder of those that diligent seek after him not those who will stand back and criticize a few days ago I heard an article on McCall's magazine and how it was criticizing some old some of the men on the field praying for the sick I was in the city where there was an editor lived and I said these men might deserve some of that criticism especially on the money and so forth they might deserve it I'm ashamed to say it but they probably do I'm not the boss but I said I'd like to ask this to that editor if these men in their mistake are trying to get something done for God what is he doing for the kingdom of [Music] God what is and when and then when I noticed the article that he said AA Allen wrote the book on the biting devils and so forth Allan never W wrote that book brother Allan never and if he never checked the article no better than that I wonder half of it is authentic that's right if it wasn't check no more closer than that but if someone's trying to do something and making blunders are you doing nothing then keep still on the thing they're getting Soul saved anyhow so what are they doing they're working against it see is I'd rather be found making a mistake than crying on the sidelines criticizing those who are trying to do something anyhow I certainly would see all right Philip said come and see that's the thing come and find out then pass your opinion you know and I think these are words of wisdom and I think that's we can all take from the word of God and we can apply it to our hearts amen shall We Stand and bow our heads can you play that song you are worthy of it [Music] all you know as we prepared to turn the service over to brother Billy I I would just ask you in your heart you know if if you felt that God's dealing with you and he's been giving you faith and maybe something's battering at your faith you know because that's what he wants to do he wants to attack our faith and he wants to try to make us uneffectual for God you know there's things that he's criticized us on but the devil's been lying and you you you know you're in a battle but if you would say tonight and just by the lifting of your hand if you want to say say God let the faith of God come into me and let it make a difference on these you know I don't want a critical spirit you know if someone's criticized me let me do like the word says to do let me wait on you Lord and let me get an answer from you God bless you let's pray Heavenly Father Lord you hear the hearts Cry of your believing children Lord Here I Am Lord Desiring oh God that the criticisms oh God that try to batter against your children's Faith Lord may you overshadow what you planted Lord may you give us power Lord you said you gave us power to those that would believe oh God I'm I'm praying for every heart Lord the every lifted hand father Lord we heard your Eternal Word Lord we know that it'll produce oh God and so we claim it now father Desiring oh God that lives would be changed in the criticisms Lord we would be rugged Christians

made flesh in this day Messiah it's father I I pray your mercies Upon Us Lord when the enemy comes in Lord let us do like the word says and let us humble ourselves to your word Lord let us submit ourselves to your word Lord resist the devil resist the criticisms that are false Lord and oh God we know that that the devil must flee father we're committing each heart to you Lord Desiring your blessings and we're thankful for this service Lord we're thankful for the works that you did and that are doing Lord we just ask your blessings upon each one now bless our pastor Lord as he's been

may help rise up Lord when it's needed and Lord may you minister to him Lord what he has need of in his body and his mind Lord as the enemy would war and rage against us all Lord surely would attack the ministry Lord but father let us bind our hearts together in prayer Lord and belief Lord Lord you said in your word that if one would cause a thousand to to to flight two can take 10 thousands father Lord let us be faithful in prayer Lord let us be faithful in service and let us be faithful father into taking you at your word and listening to the message Lord let it change our lives Lord

cares about everything he cares about the little fish and he cares about all his creations and he cares about his sons and daughters he's mindful of you he he wants you the scripture says in Jeremiah that I know the thoughts that I have for you he he's plan your life he wants you to have a good life he wants you to prosper he want to have to have all the things that he has in store for you so you can have it amen I'm so thankful and the scripture will tell us that the SC the spirit that we have received is the spirit of adoption what is that mean it's a teachable spirit when we come to the house of God and the word is preached when the Spirit hears the word it says AB father says amen father I heard I heard the criticism and I heard the correction and I'm going to try to do better I'm going to let the spirit Lift Me Up of where I am that I may go do better when he hears the spirit within you wants to conform with the word that spoke it because it's the same Spirit the spirit that
