actually don't have a special testimony great morning everyone how y'all doing y'all doing good it's good that's good um i'm starting to come to a realization that uh everything that happens whether i wanted to or i don't it's god's plan um i woke up one day it was probably about two weeks ago and it's a sign on my wall and it says um get up time waits for no one so go attack it and um it's about five in the morning um i'm on my way to um a meeting in frisco but i get in the car with this young individual in my business and um we were just talking about the glory of god and all the things that has happened in our life or the things that are going to happen in our life and just looking forward to the future and um he tells me about this time where he was imperfectly aligned with what he needed to be you know he was in the right spot at the right time he didn't know he was there but he was just like yeah there was a reason why i'm here and he tells me about the situation or whatever and i tell him about my situation and as we're passing through this light there's a truck coming and i mean i don't know we had probably like two seconds to visually see the truck the truck hits us we get t-boned we spin out of control and we back into a post and in that instant you know i've never i've never really been in a car wreck like serious car wreck i've never been it so i just been like tapped or something but uh this was a serious car wreck um he total lost his car but uh in that moment he looked at me he said carlos are you okay i said yeah i said are you okay he said yeah he said let's go be a blessing i was like okay before i got out the car i called my uh my personal sponsor in business and i said hey we were just in a car wreck we're gonna be a little late to this meeting he was like okay go see how many people you can bless i was like dude i was just in a car wreck he was like god doesn't god cares but you know god wants you to be a blessing in this moment are you okay yes i'm okay okay go be a blessing so i i get out the car um there's a there's a group of women that walk up to us asking we're okay i said yes are you okay they were like yeah so you know we go around start talking to people get people's names and informations and um come to find out there's this woman that she just survived stage four cancer um i just survived a car wreck so i was like wow give me a hug i got a hug from her she told me that everything happens for a reason i was like you're right um after that my uh my buddy that we were in the car with he goes up to the sign and i was like i'm not going to touch a sign i was like i don't touch random signs it's just sitting somewhere out in the world he was like dude look at it i said okay so we opened up the sign i'm gonna let y'all read the sign in a little bit but we opened up the sign and i just i was like you know i i i didn't know that uh that the guy has a reason for you and everything that you do now i'm gonna open up the sign real fast all right cool so when the sign says this is the sign by the way when i backed into a post this was on the post oh i'm bad sorry so it says okay so it says jesus is the truth the light wait jesus jesus is the way the light and the truth thank god for what you have and in that moment the first thing i could think about was i have my life he doesn't have his car but we have our life he doesn't have you know transportation anymore but we have our life so in that time i got to thinking you know just be thankful for what you do have whether it's whether it's a friend whether it's a parent whether it's a brother whether it's a sibling whether it's a smile just give it give it all you got that's my testimony [Applause] amen praise the lord amen oftentimes we get focused on what we don't have amen we forget to remember what he's given us that we can praise him this morning let's all stand amen let's invite our pastor out this morning amen [Music] [Music] the news of the resurrection hallelujah [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh god [Music] hallelujah you believe he's alive this morning oh and he's a lot oh god loves us [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh he's alive [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] his hands [Music] oh [Music] amen our father because you live we live also oh we're so grateful life beyond this life father we just are so thankful as we take this day to reflect and remember what was accomplished [Music] we just asked you to bless us this morning be with us touch every need may we take hope and courage today we ask these things in the precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles uh i'd like to turn over to saint john the 11th chapter i'd also like to just play a a small portion this morning i i just feel like easter would be a good day to listen to a little bit of the messenger amen and and but i love these scriptures and and you know how it is many of you have expressed this to me and and we've expressed it to one another that how that you'll listen to a message and and it really blesses you and then maybe it kind of uh goes back on your shelf or or to wherever that you would store it and then you come back the season comes back and you come back to it again and all of a sudden it's like something that's so brand new and so fresh and and you think wow it's all underlined in everything and sure enough you'll find two or three paragraphs there that are just standing out to you that's not underlined yet and uh and it's just so real well if this this last week is i've been reading the easter seal it's just been just really fresh to me and it's it's been a great challenge to me what it really means to have a resurrected life but we just like the fellowship this morning uh just i i don't really have a lot of notes just maybe read a few things and just really talk about what it is that we really have well let's read these great scriptures here and starting in the 21st verse of the 11th chapter of the gospel of saint john the 11th chapter and then martha then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hath been here my brother had not died but i know that even now whatsoever that will ask of god god will give it thee and jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again and martha said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day now when jesus you know in the 23rd verse jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again it sounded like the words of comfort that we give one another at a funeral you know i i'm so sorry but he'll rise again you know but this was something different and so now he says to her he says thy brother shall rise again and martha says i said unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day and jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and i just i like just to let hold that right there i am the resurrection in other words there's no resurrection outside of me i am the resurrection the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe us without this and i'll tell you this next verse is something that i hope can always ring from my lips she said unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated what a what a marvelous thing that jesus spoke here he said i i am the resurrection and and the life and what a beautiful day that easter is to us because without it we would have nothing and you know uh we look at this day and we watch the lord as he was trying to express something to martha that he was more than just one that came and uh taught the scriptures and we know that he taught and people marveled at the things that he taught he taught like no other man he spake like no other man and so if you pictured yourself there and you went to one of his meetings and when we were visiting in israel they took us to a place that they said this is the mount where jesus gave the sermon on the mount and the hillside was there and you could look over the rolling hill and you could picture in your mind the people sitting there maybe some had brought their picnic baskets and and they had come to hear what this young rabbi from uh nazareth was preaching the one that was a galilee and uh there at that area was a great trade route they said where people uh traveled and uh and went up and down the coast there by the sea of galilee it was sort of the main highway route so many people would travel and come and jesus taught quite a bit in that area along those places and he would hold his services in his meetings and he gathered the people at this time and he spoke like no man spoke he said you know if your brother compels you to go a mile go twain and if they ask you for your coat give them your cloak also and uh if he smites you on the cheek turn the other cheek they've never heard anything like this blessed is the peacemaker well he shall inherit the kingdom of god and he spoke uh the words there that we so often read in in the sermon on the mount in those chapters of six and so of saint matthew and and the great teachings that he got and everybody was marveled because they never saw a man like this and then you know then he began to do something that had never been done before he began to stretch forth his hand and have compassion and pray for people and and great works begin to happen and signs and wonders was in their midst and and today even if we would look all the people that the lord laid his hands on back there 2000 years ago none of them are sitting in our midst today there there had to be something more that he could offer and though he was doing signs and wonders like nobody had ever done before i mean just think of it the scripture said that there was one that was born blind and he prayed for him and he received his sight and then when they they began to question him and he said you know this one thing i know he said i was blind but now i see and and they said well who by what power did he do this and he looked at me said your guys are the leaders of israel you're the ones that are preaching to the people and telling us and you don't know by which power that i've received my sight this one thing i do know i was blind and now i see [Applause] so uh you know there there was a a great uh controversy and and and i i think so much that the controversy was over what was jesus's motive and objective what was he doing there why did he come and i think that's what they couldn't lay their understanding on what was why that he came why that he was here what was the purpose of his his coming and and as we begin to to understand afterwards as we look back but while he was doing these signs and these wonders and they were teaching there there rose up indignation against him from the leaders and the rulers of that time they they begin to fight against him and they begin to look at ways they could bear false witness against him and twist the the the images of what that he was doing to make it look like he was doing it for himself and he had a selfie mode and objective but he only had one motive and objective that was to return eternal life back to the believer that's why he was going to go to that cross he was going to go to the cross to pay for our sin because the wages of sin is death and the day that you eat thereof is the day that you die and and and that was what that he saw and that's what he said don't worry about him that can cause the first death but worry about him that causes the second death or the eternal separation from god and and this is why that easter as we call it easter or resurrection sunday or or whatever words and everything that we might express and want to talk about it it what that was delivered for us and what was one and so jesus expressed uh he expressed himself he himself expressed himself so it wasn't somebody else expressing uh something but he himself expressed himself and and the love that he had in his heart and what that he wanted to do for the people in in in healing the sick it it it was such a a representation of what that the the uh what that he possessed that he possessed a power within himself to overcome sickness leprosy a a thing at one time was a great curse something that came upon a person's skin and ate it up and and they basically kind of deteriorated and and they lost their lives and it was so contagious that they had to put them in colonies and they had to live by themselves and they had to ring a bell or or cry out if they went to the to travel they would travel in small bands and they would cry out unclean unclean so people could keep their social distance away from them they just didn't want to come in contact with them unless that they would be contagious and we preached that wednesday night that faith is contagious okay amen but he had within himself the power over that he had the power over leprosy and we we know the story of the leopards that came to him and and they asked him to make them clean and and he cleansed them and they were well and yet they went away and only one of them came back and thanked him for what that he uh their healing and i believe that's when jesus imparted to that one leopard something that was beyond his healing okay and so we we saw that he possessed something that that he that he had you understand that he was he was expressing that he had the power over sickness he had the power over the enemy he had the power over sickness now he only expressed that he had the power over death and so this great expression of himself the love he had for the people the love that uh that he he he had for the needy and those that were suffering and and and this great uh uh i only think express it as this great command and this great conqueror that he was that he could do the works that he that he did and people came to him i can't imagine because it's not written so much in the word of god but could you imagine the counseling that he gave because the word of god said he was a counselor he was the prince of peace in other words the peace that he imparted the counseling that he gave to people the guidance that he gave the situations that he fixed i can't imagine how many broken homes that he mended how many marriages that he mended how many people that were distraught and broken-hearted that he healed the brokenhearted in all the expressions when he said this day as the scriptures fulfilled this great manifested work that he's done that he could that he could do all these great works and then we know the story being christians that they they captured him and and they according to the scriptures we know that but they felt that they were going to put an end to them and they convicted him of blasphemy and and that's what they did him uh being a man not forwarded but not yet 50 that he knew god and before abraham you know was i am and and all the things that he said that they stopped their ears up and they just hated the very fact that he was there and and and they that others said oh he's going to cause a rebellion and it can and so even when he finally got there on the cross they looked at me said you've saved others now save yourself and that was their thinking now he could have saved himself he could have come off the cross the prophet of god said all that he had to do is point a finger you know what i mean angels this the angels were gathered about chariots everywhere all he would have done is to to cry out and say you know come save me you know and he went through that great struggling as a we listened and and and read out of the word of god that he faced up to the responsibility that he had he said for this cause i have come into the world i've come into the world to to offer a sacrifice when john introduced him he introduced him as the lamb of god behold the lamb of god this is god's sacrifice this is god's lamb we know that man brought a lamb to the temple that the priests could sacrifice them and and cover their sins and it was a sin offering that they gave and now it was god himself coming to his own temple and providing a lamb and here was the lamb of god being washed and and prepared for that hour now here he is he's there at at at calvary and and everybody in their heart they thought oh we thought this was he there's never been a man like him we've never seen works like the works that he's done we've never witnessed anything like this in all our lives and we thought this was the one that would restore the kingdom we thought this was the one that was going to take us out of the bondage of romans we thought this was one that was going to become king whatever their thoughts were they had this great thought of what he might be or what that he should do but yet he stayed true to the word of god because he had something yes as keith told him he says i have power to lay my life down and to take it up again he was the resurrection and the life and and so when they mocked them and he said oh you've saved others save yourself and he could have saved himself but if he would have saved himself he wouldn't have saved us [Applause] so we we we want to lay down and move past the point that our sins have been paid for because no need to do penance for your sins he's paid for our sins sin isn't our question every man's sin was covered he died for the sins of the world can you i don't care who that you find on the street i don't care what their condition is there has been a price paid for their sins now whether they want to accept that payment or not we don't have power over that but it's been paid for and it's their rejection of the payment that keeps them in the bondage and the power of that sin because sin is a slave master either you serve god or you serve some other master that's what habits become they're they're slave masters to you you're you you you can go so long but they just seem to be able to return and and take hold of you and can pull you back into bondage and if a believer could ever come to the place and say wait a minute this has been paid for if he i don't i don't have to be under this not because i can break the spell of it because you can't break the spell of it but he broke the spell of it and he broke the spell of it at calvary that's why he went there so we find this great place that he was and and he he possessed and demonstrated all this power over sickness all this power over sin he had answers and good answers for every question that he bought was brought to him who's whose image is on the coin you know why do you murmur against yourself why do you i mean i don't even think that we can grasp the the power and the majesty of jesus life the closest thing that we could ever have looked at it in our generation was to watch the prophet of god in this generation can and may i say it the majesty and the miraculous and the miracles and the spirit that was in his life that's what happens when god lives in a man look when he went when he went to the cross the sins were paid and men they placed them in the tomb and it would have been a marvelous story to that point but what he possessed you understand i am the resurrection i am the life so he said if i'm this if i am the resurrection then and i am the life i can lay my life down and take it up again i mean it's it was the ultimate seal for the believer i can lay my life down you can you you can take my life he died a physical death but what was in him could never die because it was eternal life and when he rose from the the grave and he came out of the grave it was the the absolute total expression of what that he possessed i have the keys to hell to grave to death i i i'm i have conquered death now that would have been great if it would have if he would have done that it would have been his testimony but he said you go up there and you wait can you tarry and the same spirit that raised me from the grave i'm going to depart on you i'm going to give you the same quickening power that quickened me from the grave i am going to return that same power to you just think of that it wasn't something that he paid the price and proved that he was the one that could pay the price and we could sit here this morning and say my sins are paid for so when i go to heaven i'm going to walk there and i'm going to say lord i'm a sinner and my sins are going to be paid for and he's going to set me in the judgment and i'm going to sit there and hope that he chooses me no he put an end to that at easter that's what he did he took the same spirit that he had the same life that was in him and he gave that life back to his children back to the believer they now became possessors of the resurrection if you have him you have the resurrection and the light you are now resurrected and are sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus i i feel in my heart even as i listen to this sermon a greater desire within me to come more into a revelation and an understanding of the possession of the resurrection what it really is that i have real what it really is what he done for me so i want to stop right here and i just want to read uh a statement uh to us before we we go and we listen to this 20 minutes this morning but the the jesus's whole life was to depart the resurrection to the believer to give them resurrection so we talk about the baptism of the holy spirit like an anointing but if we could talk about it and understand it that the baptism of the holy spirit that quickening power is the resurrection that's right it's not an event it's a possession it's a condition i know that i have resurrection and i know that i have life i know that i possess the quickening power that's going to quicken my mortal body though the skin worms eat my flesh yet shall i see god when it's not just a guide even though it leads the same guide just into all truth and righteousness but that resurrection is something that can become so real to us because such a peace to us such a satisfying a comfort to us to that we can actually say i now possess the resurrection look what he tried to show us on mount transfiguration he says look now at transfiguration just before we close transfigure the transfiguration we are all represented there in the transfiguration so we know that when jesus went up to the mountain and he took the disciples with him and and he went up there all of a sudden he became glorified and the glory of the lord and there appeared to moses in elijah with him and we know their response they wanted to set up tents they wanted to do something but that never was jesus intention he was showing them the power and the resurrection and the life he says we're all represented look what we are seeing today notice just what we're seeing today the quickening power of god we was all there there was the dead saints represented in moses and there was the resurrection and jesus christ glorified elijah and moses elijah moses elijah and jesus all standing on the mountain the dead saints were represented by moses the rapturing saints were met re represented by elijah he says jesus standing there on the mountain the dead saints the raptured saints and jesus glorified oh my god the dead saints and the raptured saying now why oh my i it's the comfort of it you understand once you possess that quickening power death doesn't change it and we're going to listen to brother branham explain that so if we're going to stop just take a few moments here out and start at paragraph uh uh 177 and we're just going to listen to just a small portion right out of the middle of this and then we'll finish up this morning and we're going to read through paragraph 239 but i'd like to point something out to you that changed this whole message to me for me um it's a statement that brother branham makes here in paragraph 178 he says you can put that up there if you have it he says no i'm yeah just here it says oh remember we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power at all though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god glory to god what uh i don't know what i say but what a hope for an old man like me knowing i see my end time right out yonder soon as 56 years old i never saw this message in the light that i've seen it as brother branham foretelling of his departure that's what he says i see my coming he comes back later and he says a man knows when his times come and he looks out and he says you know i see my departing coming soon at 56. of course you know that he passed away at 56 years of age but he and now from that point he expresses what hope that he had and what he possessed and what it was he was trying to bring to the church the return this message was the return of the resurrection to the believing saints it can you imagine that that power to resurrect was gone and it was restored back in our day so let's just listen to this this to this morning this 20 minutes and i almost want to approach it kind of more in a somber way in a reverent way in in a gracious beautiful way of appreciation understanding what this message really was it was the quickening power it was the resurrection life it was the genuine spirit of god brought back to the gentile believer so that they could take possession of it because they were deceived because an angel satan can appear as an angel of light and it would be so close in the last days it would deceive many and there had to be something that was so crystal clear that the believer could see they could see it demonstrated they could see it manifested they could see the anointing of it that they could sit there and be able to say do is what that i'm seeing is it dwelling in me and now it's offered back to the church it's offered back to the believer that god has come in this day and proved his promise presented that life once again to the church that they can believe and become a part of it and now they become possessors not some lie of satan not some joined to some denomination not joined as something that isn't real not joined to an idea or a philosophy or a church with the hopes that what you have might make it a judgment but actually bringing the same resurrection life the same quickening power and presenting it to the gentile church today that they can take possession of it and they too can have it and that's what we've got to ask ourselves do i have this resurrection am i a possessor of it let's just listen to our messenger encourages us and when you go back home and you read the rest of it i'll stop but he goes back and takes another 10-15 minutes explaining to the people that that's all my motive and objective has been the whole time was to bring to you resurrection and that's what he said the holy spirit is seeking those out who want the spirit of god so that they can be in the rapture god bless you let's just listen i think it'll be a blessing to you now let me show you i don't care if you're dead or where you're at that quickly empowers your beliefs amen years and years after his death his meat it rotted away the skin worms that eat it up but they were packing the dead man one day thrown him in on that bones and there was so much quickening power there until a man come back to life again [Music] hallelujah raised him up from the dead because that quickening power that was upon that saint of god never left him stayed right on those bones oh remember we are flesh of his flesh bone of his bones if we are his bride death won't bother that quickening power at all though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall i see god amen glory to god i don't know what to say i don't hope for an old man like me knowing i see my end time right now younger soon as 56 years old that's that's a little bitty boy i've stood here trying to proclaim this but i know that in me nothing good that i have nothing i've done but in me is that quickening power it quickened me one day from the things of the world as a young man on the eternal life all the things that's happened i've seen visions foretold things he's never let nothing fail yet i've spoken other tongues i've prophesied i've done those things by the spirit of god that dwelts in me that's quitting power i know that someday my redeemer is living now and someday when he comes these bones shall rise again they're going to meet him in the air oh hallelujah you may fear me in the sea burn it up wherever you want to that quickening power is eternal i feel easter right now yes sir i've had it for years it's in me it's in you if you the spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it's quicken you from the things of the world to the word of god only that's it it's quickening you from this life to life eternal you were once dead in sin and trespasses has now been quickened together to set and play heavenly places with christ jesus feasting on manna from above seeing the hand of god made manifested prove the promise of this day as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they were eating drinking mary given in mary and as it was in the days of lot so will it be in the hours that the son of man will be revealed on earth not son of god no more son of man come back as the prophetic message for the last day when that eagle will be flying not the line not the ox and the sacrifice age see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the roman power and then when it comes to sacrifice hour the ox went because he's a sacrificed beast of the lord then come the reformers down through the church ages come the face of a man and the reformers have been sentenced luther wesley hall calvin on down down pentecostal age but in the last message it went forth there come a flying eagle it's eagle time reveal time the word of god made manifest the word of god proved amen oh children walk into this baptism of the holy spirit come in and believe it with all your heart god will feel you looking here now we find now remember we are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones as god raised his bones and flesh out of the grave they cannot hide the man that has the potentials death cannot take him jesus said all the father has given me will come to me i'll raise him up at the last day amen oh my easter while we're right in easter when he raised we raised with him he sent the abstract back we hold it as the baptism of the holy ghost he is alive forevermore the same yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 proves that he's the same his messiah anointed ones believe then what is the messiah what is the messiah messiah is anointed one and now if he was the messiah of being the anointed one for that day to fulfill the word of god to be the redeemer and the anointed one and god raised up that body his bride is the only one for this day it's already raised with me in the resurrection because these two are one amen i wish i could tell you where i sit i wish i had the education i could do it with see i would i hope you see it i hope god the holy ghost comes down there and puts that in your heart to see what i mean the resurrection we are now in the resurrection we are sitting with him in the resurrection but only those who have life not those who do not have life they won't know it they'll never know it he'll go right on thinking they're getting the holy ghost being saved and the rapture will be over with and gone said elias has already come and they did that and you knew it not see notice this does not stop the quickening power of god notice death can't stop it you say well my mother was a spirit-filled woman my daddy i never seen a man so full of power in my daddy but he died brother branham sure that didn't stop the quickening power moses had that quickly power you believe that there never was a man like him on the earth until jesus for he didn't only see visions he talked face to face with god even a prophetess mariam disputed his word one day he said don't you fear god consider my servant moses not nobody in the world like him this hour there's never been anybody like moses i speak to moses what did he ever say it wasn't truth see i speak to moses don't you fear god don't you say a word against him and right then she was stricken with leprosy and it was dying she didn't live very long afterwards moses prayed for and moses climbed up on the mountain at 120 years of ministry or 80 years of ministry 120 years of life climbed up on the mountains and died and was buried in the valley but that quickening power was on him about 800 years later here he stand on my transfiguration amen why was he he was included in that resurrection sure he was he had the quickening power of god here was standing at joel abraham isaac the saints on the day of the resurrection that great morning that job and all of them knew that would come when he said i know my redeemer liveth hundreds and hundreds of years before christ it's actually the book of job was wrote before genesis it claimed and the oldest book in the bible and it is trials and like we go through now and his wife even the closest thing to him on earth so won't you curse god and die to death he said thou speak us like a foolish woman the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord and then when the spirit of god come upon him and he began to prophesy that i know my redeemer liveth and the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroys this body yet my flesh shall i see god and he made a place to bury himself he said if i buy this ground he bought there and buried himself later on come a man named abraham the church growing coming on up abraham well now he had the potentials of god too everlasting life eternal because god called him now notice when he died or sarah died he bought a piece of ground in palestine near job's grave and buried sarah abraham died and also was buried with sarah abraham begot a god isaac and isaac when he died he slept with abraham in the same portion of ground now when isaac begot jacob jacob died way down in egypt but being a prophet now with his potential this quickening power he said don't you bury me down here joseph come here my prophet son put your hand up on this hip that god crippled thank you swear to the god of heaven you not buried me down here what was in that man why wasn't egypt just as good as any place he was a prophet amen you know where that resurrection is going to be what's going to be in egypt in palestine said put your hands up on my crippled hip can you swear by the god that i've served you're my prophet son that you'll not bury my bones down here take me up honor and bear me joseph being a prophet also laid his hands upon his daddy said i swear to the god of abraham isaac and jacob how not bury you here they talking about bearing him up in that land why why when joseph died he said don't you bury me down here amen don't bear me down here why god's got everywhere but he has a plan joseph was a prophet he said someday listen to these words the lord god will reve we'll visit you and we'll take you out of this land and when you go you take my bones amen that quickly power was in that boat oh if the spirit of him had raised up christ the dead dwelling hallelujah he'll also quicken your mortal bodies don't put my bones down here bury them up there but those are the promise when jesus come here i've got a scripture here in matthew 27 51 when jesus raised from the dead job seen that coming said i know my redeemer liveth the last days he'll stand upon this earth though the skin worms has destroyed this body yet my flesh shall see god i'll see him they know that was a prophet abraham was a prophet isaac was a prophet jacob was a prophet joseph was a prophet and they had the revelation of god according to his word amen on that easter morning when that one came and redeemed all those who believed on him they raised two according to the bible that quickening power come into the grave of job where there wasn't even a spoonful of the dust of his bones after almost hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years his bones had decayed it went back and turned back to the gases of the earth just a mere ash dust lay there but yet when that's quickening power according to the word of god to the promise hundreds and hundreds yes thousands of years later when that quickening power was brought forth in the grave job abraham isaac jacob harlem come out of the grave with him the bible said so saint matthew 27 chapter and 51st verse it said many of the saints that slept in the dust the earth resurrected it come out of the graves with him when he come up on easter morning why they had that potential they had that quickening power see and raised up from the dead and went with him in the resurrection enjoyed the resurrection with him because they were full of that quickening power they had that genuine easter seal which they always shall lay back in the old testament wait a minute in first thessalonians the fourth chapter the 16th verse she read that i would not have you in your brother concerning those that sleep that's your sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again the third day not make belief but we believe it even so them that sleep in him shall god bring with him the new testament saints with that quickening power shall resurrect also at his second coming just as sure as the old testament saints with all that quickening power upon their bones and translations and powers and so forth that showed of god that prophets who the word of god came to they resurrected with him on that resurrection morning and with the promise of god that everyone that's in christ jesus will also come with him in his resurrection the quickening power of god upon the bones no wonder we lay hands on the sick no wonder we love one another we are brothers and sisters we shouldn't hate one another because we're corrected by the word of god we should love one another and have respects for one another you know if you don't it won't help you this little fella sitting right here under this church now a few days ago that man believes little old boy had a cancer on his ear and he wouldn't say nothing about he's working up there at the house i've been on a hunting trip with him up there at the mosley brothers and brother dawson here was up here hunting brother william's son and i have to look over on his ear and i see his ear all swole up and i said what's the matter donovan now here he said brother it's been on a long time i don't know i just miss caught into the hand there that was a big cancer on his ear never said one word just held it without my brother in a day or two at that there wasn't even a star left of it it was his respect amen and the god of heaven by his quaking power killed that cancer and spared the life of donovan wurtz back there it's ryan what is these things look at your people here in phoenix look at you people who's believed in this look at the people who has this that lays their hands upon you watch what happens it's quickening power these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick that quickly power eagle to eagle something's going to take place now eagle to a buzzard won't work eagle to eagle raises from the barnyard to the heavenlies these signs shall follow them that believe when they're both in belief see that same quickness power of god represented in these two prophets elijah and elijah notice the same word one of them it's ketchup the others caught up catch up and caught up see he was caught up we'll be catch up catch up with him meet him in the air be caught up to meet him in the air notice a bird has to have two wings to balance himself that right elijah was a translating wing elijah elisha was a resurrection wing see both of them together representing the saints that are living and the saints that are going on remember quicken to see the past the curtains how these people were quickened back there to look past the curtain and see down in this time those prophets look at paul said in the last days how these people be acting call themselves christians he was a prophet full of the quickening power for sword coming to pass we believe that don't we he received quickening power look at the quickening power today for telling things without one event missing not one time does it fail quickening power not the power of a man the power of god the power the abstract of easter the resurrected jesus has sent back the abstract to guarantee us that we're already quickened with him notice you remember the little book businessman here looking to pass the curtain of time i began to get older knowing my days are getting shorter now i get real i play that little piece of them ladies saying a while ago i've had it for about 18 20 years now i want to talk it over lord then get out there and go to praying then that quickening power comes i'm rested up and i looked up there and i said look at yonder i remember that morning being caught up as my wife sitting back there laying on the same bed with me that morning i was raised up and looked up and there she was asleep i said if i'm going to do anything to the lord you better hurry up or here or past 50. and then the holy spirit caught me away and i looked over there i seen those saints just as certain i'm standing here but this desperate sacred book laying here and a minister of the gospel have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened i want you to tell me about it every time has it been perfectly at the platform every time has it happened just like he said this was thus saith the lord i stood there and looked over that time and i've seen tens of thousands times thousands coming young men and women run throwing their arms around me screaming i'll look right back and see myself laying on the bed oh lord let me look at past the curtain of time what is it it's quitting power that'll catch us away that great quickening power the quickening power coming this last days that's what i'm in arizona for right now there's many people sitting right here stood right here at phoenix and heard me tell you from this very platform thus saith the lord how many remembers that of course something's fixed that happened i saw seven angels come didn't life magazine packet is the fog of it floated across here 27 miles high and 30 miles across it's not fred stop and these other gene norman i'm sitting back there stood right there when them seven angels appeared right there on the hill and shut the hills for miles around like that there stood seven angels and thrown a sword in hand said go home and open these seven seals they were given and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent's seed and all these things has been fussed about it's the santa lord what is it the acquainting power coming to the church making it already this hour that we're approaching quickening power oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it see just depends on what attitude you take to it what's going to do you any good or not at all so you have to believe that if you don't believe it it won't do you one bit of good how samuel stood there before that people said have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened did i ever beg you for your money to live on no but we want the king anyhow that's the way the church is today they want their own ideas they won't pay a bit of attention to you they'll walk right around well let's just go show the quickening power is not there always say well i spoke in tongues i jumped i shouted that's all fine but that quickening quickly powers there you'll recognize like that little eagle that's his mama that's the word that's thus saith the lord that's what god promised that's what was foretold that's exactly what happened we're beyond any shadow of doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air so jesus so full of this quickening power said if you can destroy this temple it took you 40 years you thought to bill i'll raise it up in three days why why could jesus say that onto ashton why could jesus say a thing like that he knew that he was amen amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it he knew he was one david spoke of do you know you're the one the bible speaks of yes do you know your position is in christ if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like everyday living to you well sure it's yours you are an eagle that's your food hey man you know there's there's some great questions that settled and i i see so many people they they battle with whether they're going to be in the rapture or not but you see the rapture has two parts it's got two wings the translated right and the quickened just how just how he he said it i i wanted to uh i i maybe i i forgot to mark it down here he says a bird has two wings to balance it that's right elijah was translating wing elijah was the resurrection wing so there's those of us that if the lord if the lord tarries and it and you would bury me somewhere or broad brown goes on to say burn me up put me into ashes i don't care what you do with me because if that spirit is in me it's on my bones it'll quicken my bones then i would be the i would be the resurrected part of the rapture i'm in the same rapture you are but i represent the resurrection wing if you're still here you represent the translation wing it doesn't matter whether you're in the resurrection wing or the translation wing you've got to have the quickening power that's what makes it it can and then we can go back and we can begin to understand and look at this message in in a much greater light it wasn't god sending a message to correct everybody's heir to to to uh prove that all these doctrines were false he just that's not all that he was doing he just wasn't doing the signs and wonders to prove that jesus was a healer because many people believe that jesus was a healer but you've got to understand what that he was bringing back to the church what he was putting on display what he was representing what it meant to have the son of man show up god veiling himself in a prophet proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever it was the demonstration and display of the quickening power so the believer could look and see it move hear the word of it know what it is and be able to ask themselves do i possess this not get in a conflict with it oh that doesn't match up to my doctrine oh i i don't see it that way this is what i think that's what he said the church is in the same condition today they never give up their ideas but your ideas won't make you a part of that resurrection [Applause] [Music] i don't care what part i'm in if i'm translated or i'm resurrected i know one thing that i've got to possess that same spirit that he had he is the resurrection i am the resurrection life no man cometh unto the father but by me you've got to have this life that i had in me i'm willing to give it to you but what satan do he appears as an angel of light he offers religion he offers church he offers all kinds of things but the one thing that he can't offer is eternal life eternal life comes from god he was trying to get us to see our position but there had to be something you understand that life had to present itself so that you can look at it and and identify with it and it identify with you so that now you could look at it you could know what it was and it would identify you it would possess you and you would possess it and then you know you have it you know you possess it this message was the return we can call it a lot of things we sometimes we refer to it as the lord coming back the appearing of the lord the second coming of the lord but when reality you understand if it was him it's resurrection because he is the resurrection and the life that's what he brought back to the church it wasn't a new doctrine it was the same thing that paul preached it wasn't god never was a trinity he just preached what god was but what was it what was the spirit that he had what was the nature that was put on display through our messenger what was what was the what was it that he was really bringing to us and telling us that we had to have you have to have him you've got not just him as who he was historically not just him as a a copy of his work but that that life that you can actually become a possessor and have the resurrection in you and you can actually say i know that i live because he lives i don't know how to express it just the way that i'd like to express it but but let me just read it to you this way it's in paragraph 84 and the same thing is with every true believer when the preaching of god's word comes forth and it's vindicated and proved that it's god's word for this hour then there's something within the believer i don't care how loyal his father was to church or how loyal his mother was or his grandparents and if the church is teaching contrary to this hour of the baptism of the holy ghost message what a what a way to word it this message was a baptism for the believer and what was the baptism what did they go into the upper room so they could be endured with power from on high that they too would be possessors of the resurrection oh death where's your string oh grave where's your victory i have a crown waiting for me they knew they would rise up they knew he was going to come again it was settled and let me tell you when you're outside the word of god for the hour if you haven't become one with it if you haven't become a part of it you still struggle that's good thank you i have it i have a nephew and and he's a good baptist boy and and we always marveled at him because his wife never wore pants and he was clean and and lived good and we had a lot of hope we go back this time and he's smoking a cigar and his wife's in pants and you sit back because you understand their mind can't hold them your mind can't hold you you've got that you've got to understand what it is that he's trying to give you he's not trying to give you just a holy way of life because this world would be done away with he's not just trying to to give you a temporary peace what he's trying to impart to you is what will take you out of the grave or what will take you off of this earth what he's trying to give you is the resurrection now we are in the resurrection we're in easter why because if we've received his word for the hour we've received his spirit because his spirit is in his word hallelujah don't just receive the word without the power don't just receive the word without the life understand what it is that he's giving you this message isn't a new just a new way to believe different everybody else it is actually the imparting of eternal life to the believer in this age it's giving those that the holy spirit is seeking out as we read it here he says it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken and make alive those people that's foreordained of god to be in the rapture hallelujah that's what the message is it's the holy spirit of god coming down and anointing those who are predestinated and foreordained to be in the rapture oh praise god thank you lord thank you you just didn't break america and that's to me the prophet of god said i'm soon going to go but the spirit that's on me the words that i have they're still anointing they still carry the quickening power amen just because he left the scene didn't mean that quickly and power left it's still in the gospel it's still the words of life that impart the believer that's why the prophet of god left the scene again he and he stored up to his word and the holy spirit's there to break that word and then you come along no matter where you lived one day you came along why because the holy spirit's hunting you out isn't that what he's doing i like it here it says and the spirit today is hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message what did the spirit do what did the quickening power do what did the resurrection do your name was written on the lamb's book of life you were for ordained to receive the resurrection amen not for ordained to recognize that that was a prophet many people recognize he's a prophet but what the what that spirit of that message was it wasn't an anointed teaching it wasn't an anointing teaching but it was more than that you understand it was actually the resurrection itself the resurrection power itself the real quickening power itself in other words this message doesn't impart a knowledge it imparts a life [Applause] i am the resurrection and the life you can't come in this without me and here i've returned back veiled in a prophet not son of god son of man preaching the presenting to the church resurrection and they turned it down but you didn't because it was foreordained for you it sought you out everything in the bible was promised is to the believer and when you accept it in its fullness then god knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract of that the proof of it the ownership remember that's what a deed does it proves you're the owner of it nobody can take that property from you and let me tell you when you've received this message and you've received the spirit of this message when you understand what it was that this message was bringing not knowledge to not a different doctrine not a different teaching even though the doctrines were true in life but what comes with truth is freedom that's what sets you free what sets us free from this world is resurrection hallelujah resurrection or translation i don't care what it is but if i have that quickening power it'll quicken my body also i'm not afraid of the grave we're not afraid of that you are if you're not sure [Music] but you understand he's trying to wipe away all the fear and doubt by sending a ministry by displaying to you by signs and wonders and vindication by showing you and you know that that's the truth that life is the truth that spirit is not the spirit of man that's the spirit of christ that's the word of god and you call back out like that like coming out of that little eaglet in the pen you say that's what i want to be and when you accept it it seals you unto the day of your redemption nothing can ever take it out you you've got it it's a possession that's in you so deep and so real see there's something with he says there's something in him that screams out he'll leave the barnyard he's got to do it the chicken might have been all right one day but this eagle but this is eagle hour it's different there is something that he must leave the old coop and fly away into the blue then this earthly body is quickened and brought by the quickening spirit to the obedience of the word of god what what makes us line up to the word of god it isn't law it's life he gives you the life he gives you the quickening power to line up to the word we don't we're not perfect he said now this holy spirit represents as the flying eagle over the land to find the believer no man can come to me no man can come to me as he wants to all the father hath given me will come to me but no man can come by himself it's your own thinking your own drawing it's god's drawing all the father hath given me will come to me and now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as he finds it it does just like it did on jesus a great super son of god who redeemed us all it comes down and takes its place and abodes in the human life now notice brought the quickening power now that quickening power that comes upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of god do you understand what he just said he says that word goes out that spirit goes out it's hunting that believer and when he finds it when he finds the believer he finds the one that says that's the truth i believe that pillar of fire i believe that was the messenger of the hour i believe this is the fulfillment of the word i believe it and then what does what does he do to that believer when he's when that believer cries out i believe it then he departs that power to that believer and now they become a possession of it and that's why that eagle went to wherever you are whatever country you're in whatever family you were in however you were brought up it found you it sought you out you did not choose him he chose you he's the one that sought you out he's the one that finds you out you recognize it's true i just don't want to stop at recognizing it's true i want to understand that there's a promise there's an anointing that there's the right now is the time that he's giving the resurrection you can sit back and say i have the resurrection i am easter did you hear him say i wish i could just express it to you we are in the resurrection now he's now going to the gentile church in the lady osean age giving them the resurrection life how are we going to be trans raptured if we don't have habit [Music] and this and when we can see this easter this message that was so true of the word of god gets so beautifully uh spoken and this is how he he he he makes this great statement and it is so beautiful i wrote it down here he said not long ago i was preaching and there was an old colored man come back there at the back building and met me and said reverend i want to tell you i says you is right he said i done told the lord a long time ago i want my ticket in my hand that morning i want to know that it's marked right it's going to be a lot of trouble down there at the river he said i'm coming down that river he said i don't want no trouble there i want to get it all straightened up right here that's right he says you got your visa if you haven't got your visa you might have a passport but if you haven't got your visa you can't enter the land you know that you have got your everything ready if it isn't if it isn't right now is the time to do it and in my note here i said page 15 paragraph 92 and that was an old old note and i went back and i read paragraph 92 he said but he that understandeth he that knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me hath present tense eternal life and shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death to light then when this new eternal life dwells in you it's the potential or the earnest of your being quickened from mortal to immortality and i went back what's my visa what what would i have to do to make sure it's ready he said he that understandeth and knoweth his place in this hour and hears my word you see how privileged you are don't look at this message like a religion don't look at it like just teachings on this and and where we can have our understanding and though i understand all mysteries but yet if i don't have the love of god if i don't have that quickening power if i don't have that resurrection if i if i haven't seen what's been offered to me just think he's offered to you to be able to take into your life and to your heart the spirit that will tr translate you or resurrect you however god has it i don't care you say well wait a minute doesn't this happen to happen do you understand what i'm saying if the resurrections come and it's here and the resurrection life has been departed i don't care what the clock does that's right i don't care if the world goes on the thousand years that don't matter because the resurrection the power he came in this generation and imparted and gave the resurrection to every predestinated seed so they have it in their hand they know where they stand and when the train leaves they'll be on it and when the porter asks for your ticket you can show it and you know you just it don't matter oh it i when i read this i understood it more than ever really what brother branham brought we we think so much that he brought the restoration and and he brought the back us back to the apostles doctrine and brought us back to their miracles and brought us back to those experience but he said god never goes back he always goes forward he didn't bring us back what he told us was that they went to the upper room and received the resurrection and there's not a new generation that's going to get a new baptism and a new group of people no there's one life people talk about the new generation when brother brown talks about the new generation i feel i'm that new generation people brother branham left the scene just a few years three years later four years later we hear of the message and we believe it i'm that generation but we're all that generation we're the generation that receives the resurrection from the messenger's word that we all come to because it's the only place to get it so there's not this group that's a new group in this group that's an old group and i'm some old fuddy-duddy that don't believe in this oh no i believe what the prophet of god said i've got it i possess it it's in me and it doesn't matter which wing i am sir when he comes i'm goin and it's settled is it settled with you this morning it's a gift of god and if you want to know where it is i tell you go listen to the message of the hour that reveals resurrection life and ask it to come into your heart god bless you let's stand this morning oh what an easter egg praise god praise god did you yeah how many of you caught that and i i i played it because i there was things he said i really wanted you to maybe grab out of it yourself did you understand why we lay hands on the sick because we possess quickening power not us it's him in us he's the resurrection but we've received the resurrection now that resurrection is in us we're possessors we have the same thing that raised jesus is in us now we can lay cans on the sick eagle to eagle it won't work if
