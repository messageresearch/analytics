[38:48] thing in the church so we're certainly
[38:51] uh
[38:52] we're certainly uh grateful for that
[38:55] we just want to we won't have testimony
[38:58] service tonight so we're gonna
[38:59] just say a few things and then we're
[39:01] gonna play a little portion of a tape
[39:04] and then i'll kind of explain to you why
[39:06] i played that portion of the tape
[39:08] and then uh we have our testimony
[39:12] from that point so if you have a
[39:14] testimony
[39:16] think about it you know
[39:20] i i could start testifying forever amen
[39:23] you know what i mean he's done he's done
[39:26] so much for me
[39:27] that god's going to have to create a
[39:29] whole nother bunch of oceans
[39:31] and a whole bunch another parchment sky
[39:34] and a whole bunch of more
[39:36] scribes to write it all
[39:39] you know i was thinking the other day i
[39:41] just want to give a testimony
[39:43] and sometimes you know testimonies i sav
[39:47] you know what i mean it just god just
[39:49] comes down
[39:50] they put some eyesight on your ice aven
[39:53] and and you just realize wow lord
[39:56] forgive me
[39:58] you are in control all the time you had
[40:01] me in the palm of your hand
[40:03] and you know and you know that
[40:06] we've been just going through this major
[40:10] struggle with the city to
[40:13] get our church built you know they keep
[40:15] coming up with this and coming up with
[40:17] that and coming up with this and
[40:19] they're trying to get us to do all the
[40:21] work and all the engineering and
[40:23] everything it cost us money you know
[40:25] what i mean
[40:26] and and of course and yet they can build
[40:29] two liquor stores in 30 days you know
[40:32] what i mean
[40:33] and we're trying to get a different kind
[40:34] of spirit
[40:36] you know so they got they got a spirit
[40:38] store down here you know
[40:40] back and we're trying to build another
[40:42] spirit store
[40:43] where you can get the spirit and they've
[40:45] been fighting this you know
[40:46] so it started a couple years ago
[40:50] and it just seemed like what
[40:53] is wrong and then you know i would get
[40:56] the thinking
[40:57] well maybe god don't want me to do it
[41:00] god don't want me to do it
[41:01] and then i'm just ready to fold it up
[41:04] and the
[41:05] lord comes down and gives brother uh
[41:08] adrian a stefan a prophecy a word of the
[41:12] lord just straight word of the lord
[41:14] that come down and he come to me and he
[41:17] gave me the word of the lord and i was
[41:19] there
[41:20] and it was perfect and and uh
[41:23] and you know i got it in on my desk and
[41:26] then
[41:27] i meant some more coming and then
[41:29] brother john samuel comes brother sam
[41:32] john samuel has dreams so you just can't
[41:34] get around it i know for a fact
[41:36] that he does because i have dream dreams
[41:39] and he's dream dreams
[41:40] you know and don't think that we don't
[41:43] dream dreams
[41:44] and see visions you know what i mean
[41:48] and don't think that the gift of
[41:49] discernment doesn't lie
[41:51] within the office it's here god's
[41:53] working but god's always hid
[41:55] in simplicity you know what i mean so he
[41:58] moves
[41:59] in mysterious ways so he comes with a
[42:02] dream
[42:03] and then almost everybody i talked to
[42:06] even in the friends in the world that i
[42:09] said what are you doing so i'm trying to
[42:10] build the church fight and say
[42:12] they said how big it's going to be i
[42:13] says well you know
[42:15] we've only got a couple maybe two 300
[42:17] people
[42:18] and we're building it for 500 every
[42:20] single one of them says it's not big
[42:22] enough
[42:23] it's not big enough yeah even
[42:26] john tells me it's not big enough he's
[42:28] from ohio
[42:29] who can you believe from ohio you know
[42:31] what i mean so
[42:33] uh okay and yeah so sorry
[42:38] uh we've really had a nice time together
[42:42] and so uh you know and it doesn't look
[42:45] like
[42:46] it's going that way at all and then we
[42:49] know
[42:49] that uh c19 hit
[42:54] okay so we battle for a year
[42:57] c19 hits and
[43:00] we got 10 people in the building right
[43:04] and the cops are in the foyer
[43:08] making sure we don't have any more than
[43:12] 10. that does not look like an
[43:14] atmosphere to build a church in
[43:17] right and everybody's running around
[43:18] with masks and people are getting sick
[43:21] and it doesn't look like we have any
[43:23] future at all
[43:25] and so it just the other day
[43:29] i'm sitting back and we finally were
[43:32] able to go
[43:33] into our little thermometer
[43:36] there in the back and it's only we only
[43:38] have a thermometer because i haven't
[43:40] been able to find anything more
[43:42] spiritual
[43:43] and i really didn't want to build a
[43:44] pyramid that had anything to do with
[43:46] money
[43:47] pyramids supposed to do with character
[43:49] and
[43:51] spirituality so
[43:55] but we we hit the uh we hit the 400
[43:59] 000 mark and
[44:05] last month we had matching funds
[44:09] of fifteen thousand dollars so that
[44:12] means that people put
[44:13] fifteen thousand dollars into our
[44:16] building fund
[44:17] and the business person that's backing
[44:20] it
[44:21] he matched it with fifteen thousand
[44:23] dollars
[44:24] so it's well some people didn't have the
[44:27] money at that time
[44:29] so they wrote a pledge i'll give i'm
[44:32] gonna get this back i'm this is coming
[44:34] down the road
[44:35] i pledge that well the person said okay
[44:37] i'll extend it for the month
[44:39] of april so we still have 35 000 dollars
[44:42] up there that we can match but in the
[44:45] meantime
[44:46] we are able to come almost
[44:49] to uh right now with other funds that
[44:52] have been set aside
[44:54] and in the the ministers brothers in the
[44:57] church
[44:58] uh instead of giving them an offering
[45:01] when they preach we've been
[45:02] taking their money and the minister's
[45:04] money and putting it aside in a special
[45:07] fund for the building so with
[45:10] all what the ministers have donated by
[45:13] preaching
[45:14] and not receiving offerings and all that
[45:17] we've set aside
[45:18] with that money and our money were that
[45:20] about six hundred thousand dollars
[45:23] so that's that really helped so
[45:27] um okay
[45:31] so but what i realized was
[45:34] if we would have built that church
[45:36] before covet
[45:38] we would have had a gigantic bill nobody
[45:42] working and nobody to pay for it
[45:44] you know and uh um
[45:48] yeah and if the timing of the lord is
[45:51] just impeccable and
[45:54] so i i was really moved and then i
[45:57] really realized
[45:58] how much he was looking after us
[46:02] when it really didn't appear that he was
[46:07] and and and during that time we've had
[46:09] wonderful brothers
[46:10] join our fellowship and and they've uh
[46:14] you know they've come to the lord we've
[46:16] seen uh uh
[46:17] people that are coming to the lord
[46:20] people that were sinners people that
[46:21] were in sin
[46:23] we've had our young people be baptized
[46:25] and
[46:26] people being baptized so it is it's
[46:29] really
[46:30] exciting to see what
[46:33] god's doing so
[46:37] we are wanted tonight to have a
[46:40] testimony service
[46:44] but i wanted to play about 15 minutes
[46:48] out of a message called what heary
[46:52] and as we listen to this we'll read the
[46:56] scripture here
[46:57] in a moment it's what i'm what
[47:01] my desire is is
[47:05] i want our testimony
[47:09] to be and and testament you have
[47:12] testimonies whatever you feel led to
[47:13] testify about
[47:14] what god's done for you but i'd like
[47:17] also like to see that
[47:18] hear from what god spoke to you
[47:21] you know what i mean and so i think this
[47:24] will be a real blessing
[47:26] uh to us to listen to this and then when
[47:29] we're done
[47:30] i think uh brother matthews uh uh is
[47:33] gonna share a testimony that a sister
[47:36] um wants to have him share
[47:40] on her behalf i think that's what we're
[47:42] going to do
[47:43] and then i thought brother darian's
[47:45] testimony it was so wonderful tonight
[47:48] too because i was there in the hospital
[47:51] and i
[47:52] was there when it looked like he wasn't
[47:54] going to make it
[47:55] and god's miraculously provided him
[47:59] a liver and and it's just wonderful the
[48:02] things
[48:02] that gods can do so let's stand together
[48:06] tonight and and i know you'll enjoy this
[48:09] and and listen and take it to heart
[48:13] because the uh brother ben's really
[48:16] pointing
[48:17] to something and and when it really
[48:20] comes down to it
[48:22] in life what your greatest testimonies
[48:27] are the ones that god's personally
[48:30] spoken to you they
[48:34] never leave you you know what i mean
[48:37] you they're like they're like words of
[48:39] life to you
[48:41] and you can hold on first so let's turn
[48:43] in our bibles to
[48:44] the 19th chapter of
[48:49] the book of kings first kings the 19th
[49:00] chapter
[49:11] and you know the story here and the
[49:14] second
[49:14] verse sets the story and
[49:17] it so
[49:22] and uh you know ahab and the prophets
[49:26] and elijah had slain the prophets by the
[49:28] sword
[49:30] and so you know the story and then a
[49:33] jezebel
[49:34] sends a messenger to elijah's lies
[49:37] saying you know let the gods do unto me
[49:39] if you're not dead
[49:41] by this time tomorrow all right so
[49:45] he's been threatened and uh
[49:49] so we know that he goes out
[49:52] and he sleeps under a tree and he's a
[49:54] day's journey
[49:55] and finally he comes and and uh
[49:59] he he comes to this place that he is
[50:02] going to
[50:04] uh enter in to a cave
[50:07] so the ravens are feeding them and
[50:09] everything's feeding them
[50:10] and now he comes to this cave and
[50:14] this is where we pick up the scripture
[50:16] and this is where brother branham tells
[50:18] the story
[50:19] now we're going to go ahead in this
[50:21] sermon
[50:22] up to the 84th verse
[50:26] of a paragraph of this story but if you
[50:29] want to go back and read something that
[50:30] will really
[50:31] instruct you and bless you and become a
[50:34] part
[50:35] of the way that you look at things go
[50:38] back and listen to what does thou
[50:40] hear and he says and he came hither
[50:43] unto a cave and lodged there
[50:47] and behold the word of the lord
[50:50] came to him and he said unto him
[50:54] what does thou hear elijah
[50:59] and he said i've been
[51:02] very jealous for the lord god of hosts
[51:07] for the children of israel have forsaken
[51:10] thy covenant and thrown down
[51:13] thy altars and slain thy prophets
[51:17] with the sword and i even
[51:20] i only am left
[51:24] and thou seek my life to take it away
[51:27] and they seek my life to take it away
[51:30] and he said go forth and stand upon
[51:34] the mount before the lord and behold the
[51:37] lord
[51:38] passed by and a great and strong
[51:41] wind rent the mountain and break it in
[51:45] pieces
[51:46] and rocks before the lord but the lord
[51:49] was not
[51:50] in the wind and after the wind
[51:53] an earthquake but the lord was not in
[51:56] the earthquake
[51:57] and after the earthquake of fire but the
[52:00] lord was not
[52:01] in the fire and after the fire
[52:04] a still small voice
[52:08] and it was so he when elijah heard it
[52:12] that he wrapped his face in his mantle
[52:16] and went out and stood in the
[52:20] entering of the cave and behold
[52:24] there came a voice unto him saying
[52:28] what does thou hear elijah
[52:32] let's uh lord ask you to bless the word
[52:35] of the lord
[52:35] let's just pick up this little portion
[52:38] of the word
[52:39] and then after this this will be the
[52:41] root of our testimony service tonight
[52:44] god bless you let's listen to you may be
[52:46] seated
[52:47] as we listen to this wonderful portion
[52:49] of god's word
[52:52] hallelujah
[52:56] and we find then that he went 40 days
[53:00] and nights and god located him
[53:03] standing or pulled back in a cave
[53:07] and god wanted to attract his attention
[53:12] so there was a great storm
[53:15] passed by and it ripped the mountains
[53:20] it was so powerful to shook the rocks
[53:25] but god wasn't in the storm
[53:28] it went before god did
[53:32] and then there come again a great
[53:35] earthquake
[53:36] that shook the earth but still
[53:40] god wasn't in the earthquake and there
[53:43] come a
[53:43] fire but god wasn't in the fire
[53:48] and then there came a still small voice
[53:52] and god was in the voice and brother
[53:56] sister i've been back in the cave long
[53:58] enough and you have to to know
[54:00] that there's been a lot of earthquakes
[54:02] shaking around
[54:03] a lot of noise and fusses and stews and
[54:06] things like that and
[54:07] big meetings but where's been god out of
[54:10] it
[54:12] that's the reason i said what i did this
[54:14] morning
[54:15] there's got to come something deeper
[54:17] than a healing service
[54:19] that's got to come something deeper than
[54:22] a
[54:22] gift to speak with tongues there's got
[54:25] to be something
[54:26] deeper than a russian mighty wind
[54:30] the wind went forth but god wasn't in it
[54:33] we've had russian mighty winds all over
[54:35] the country and sensations and blood in
[54:37] the face and in the hands
[54:39] all kinds of signs but where's god
[54:42] at
[54:47] elisha waited yet he was a prophet
[54:50] but he listened to it he never went out
[54:53] to compare revivals with them
[54:55] he never went out to get the biggest
[54:56] tent in the country he never went out to
[54:58] go on television or so forth as we would
[55:01] call it
[55:01] all the great fuss and america's guilty
[55:04] of listening to those noises
[55:07] oh we love noise but god's not in the
[55:11] noise
[55:12] although as honorable in things as they
[55:14] are yet god isn't in noise
[55:17] that had been so when the africans beat
[55:19] the tom toms you never heard such a
[55:20] noise in rhythm
[55:22] god wasn't in it and we've had russian
[55:25] mighty winds we've had all kinds of
[55:27] fires and
[55:27] earthquakes and shakings and great
[55:30] revivals and things like that
[55:31] god wasn't in it if it had been it was
[55:34] showed itself
[55:35] up but after that
[55:38] come a still small voice then god was in
[55:42] the voice
[55:43] that's what i'm thinking today friends
[55:46] we people are so are
[55:48] so carried away with all the noise so
[55:51] america loves noise look at what they're
[55:54] doing they turn on these old radios
[55:56] just as hard as they can with rock and
[55:58] roll and ugly woodland
[56:00] all that kind of stuff they've got to
[56:02] have it so loud it'll blast your ear
[56:04] drums out nearly
[56:06] all the noise all the time of the day
[56:10] and in the church we beat the
[56:12] tambourines we've run up and down and
[56:14] screamed and hollered and hooped
[56:16] and had a great time like that nothing
[56:18] against it
[56:19] but where was god in it what did it do
[56:22] broke us up in little pieces called
[56:24] the assemblies of god the church of god
[56:28] the pentecostal united oneness and all
[56:31] these other different little
[56:32] denominations
[56:34] god wasn't in it it's a forerunner of
[56:38] god
[56:39] it's a framework when you see so-called
[56:42] christianity today people
[56:44] goes to churches and lives these
[56:46] dignified lives and
[56:48] goes out and denies healing and denies
[56:50] the power of god and denies a
[56:52] consecrated life
[56:54] calling you fanatics remember that's
[56:57] framework that's brother woods i believe
[57:00] you call a scaffold work
[57:02] it's a bogus it's a frame that goes on
[57:04] the outside
[57:05] god only stands on it to build the
[57:08] building
[57:09] glory god hallelujah
[57:13] it's only a bogus frame that'll be tore
[57:16] down
[57:17] amen we've tapped hands and said
[57:21] glory to god when you shout you got it
[57:24] the method has said that
[57:25] the nazarene they found out they didn't
[57:28] have it
[57:29] the pentecostal said clap your hands and
[57:31] shout till you speak in tongues you got
[57:33] it
[57:34] but we found out we didn't have it
[57:37] there's one more thing left than god
[57:39] take it to a cave then i can find it
[57:44] let's get that still small voice
[57:48] that's something that puts a cream in
[57:50] the life
[57:51] that's something that though you speak
[57:54] with tongues of
[57:55] man and angels and have not that you're
[57:58] nothing
[57:59] though you can prophesy and speak with
[58:01] tongues that
[58:02] show signs and wonders and work miracles
[58:04] and do great signs
[58:06] but at that little still small voice is
[58:08] in there you're
[58:09] nothing says the scripture that's what
[58:12] we're listening for now
[58:14] we've had the thunders we've had the
[58:17] fire
[58:18] we've had the russian winds and the
[58:20] earthquakes
[58:22] but god sent us a still small voice
[58:26] that's what we need listen brother
[58:31] we need that still
[58:34] small voice a still
[58:38] small voice that spoke
[58:42] jesus said you couldn't hear his voice
[58:44] in the street
[58:46] he didn't hear him crying he was our
[58:49] pattern
[58:50] look at him he was compared his spirit
[58:53] like a dove
[58:54] gentle it's great things
[58:57] are quite things did you know that
[58:59] friends
[59:01] listen the sun which gives life on the
[59:04] earth to every living thing
[59:07] and botany life plant life tree life
[59:09] whatever more
[59:10] it brings forth life the sun does
[59:13] and it can draw a million gallons of
[59:16] water from the earth and make less
[59:18] noise and we can get a bucket full out
[59:19] of a pump
[59:22] it's big things quite things are big
[59:26] things
[59:27] did you ever hear the world turning
[59:30] did you ever hear the planets as they
[59:32] passed through the orbits do you ever
[59:34] hear one
[59:35] that's the big things did you ever hear
[59:39] the sun rise
[59:42] oh we think we have to have a lot of
[59:44] noise have to have a brass band to beat
[59:47] a lot of jumping up and down and we
[59:49] ain't got a good meeting
[59:50] we think everybody has to be on top of
[59:52] the clapping their hands and things
[59:55] we think the music has to be going in a
[59:57] rhythm and everybody running down the
[59:58] aisle
[59:59] we've had that what good's it done
[1:00:05] where's that where's it got us today in
[1:00:07] a bunch of confusion
[1:00:09] a bunch of denominations broke up
[1:00:12] brotherhood ruined
[1:00:14] certainly it has it's been the old
[1:00:16] cankerworm and palm worm and
[1:00:18] and all kinds of bugs from back there in
[1:00:20] the beginning of jobs
[1:00:21] or joel saw them what the palm worm has
[1:00:23] left the canker worm eating what the
[1:00:25] cankerworm meat
[1:00:26] the grasshopper eaten and so forth that
[1:00:28] we've eaten down to a stone
[1:00:31] but the scripture says i will restore
[1:00:34] saith the lord
[1:00:36] we're waiting for something of all the
[1:00:39] shout we've had enough
[1:00:41] blast and noise to to convert the whole
[1:00:44] world
[1:00:46] we've had enough hurrah and hollering
[1:00:48] and carrying on until
[1:00:50] what's it done it hasn't built the
[1:00:51] church it's built denominations
[1:00:55] this made man go out with puffed up
[1:00:57] ideas and stuffed
[1:00:58] shirts i don't like that stuff
[1:01:02] walk out on the platform say oh look at
[1:01:05] him he's a prince
[1:01:07] look how he's dressed just polished and
[1:01:09] everything
[1:01:10] he knows how to make his vows and so
[1:01:12] forth that ain't what god chooses
[1:01:15] a prophet thought that one day he's
[1:01:17] going to anoint a servant
[1:01:19] he said he's the biggest of the family
[1:01:21] he'll look right
[1:01:22] but god refused him you don't have to
[1:01:26] have princes and
[1:01:27] and so forth to stand up there like i
[1:01:29] don't know what it ain't the clothes you
[1:01:31] wear or the eloquence you speak with
[1:01:33] it's the something that's inside of you
[1:01:36] that
[1:01:37] voice of god
[1:01:40] that's what it is the prophet passed by
[1:01:44] another and said that's not him
[1:01:45] god's refused him pastor and said
[1:01:47] haven't you gotten so we got a little
[1:01:49] ruddy one back here on the hillside
[1:01:50] hurting the sheep
[1:01:52] it's david the one that brought this
[1:01:54] little redheaded freckled face
[1:01:55] guy across there and his little stooped
[1:01:58] in shoulders and sheepskin after i
[1:01:59] didn't
[1:02:00] god said that's him
[1:02:03] all your big statues and stuff shirts
[1:02:06] didn't go with god
[1:02:07] you might be dddd phd or double ld
[1:02:10] you might be bishop poper or whatever
[1:02:12] you might be but it takes
[1:02:14] god to make something out of nothing
[1:02:18] as long as you can be the nothing gods
[1:02:20] of something
[1:02:22] as long as you get yourself out of the
[1:02:23] way then god can come in but when you're
[1:02:25] so stuffed up and starchy
[1:02:27] you got the biggest and the best you
[1:02:29] haven't got nothing that you ought to
[1:02:30] have
[1:02:31] that's a humble heart before god we know
[1:02:34] that brethren
[1:02:35] hallelujah certainly sure you never
[1:02:39] really see
[1:02:40] you'll hear the sun rise you never
[1:02:42] didn't hear that
[1:02:43] did you ever go out at night to hear the
[1:02:45] dew fall
[1:02:47] what will we do without it see it don't
[1:02:50] take
[1:02:51] that i'll tell you one thing now
[1:02:54] it's the still it is the riffling waters
[1:02:57] that makes such a big noise and jumps up
[1:02:59] and down
[1:03:00] that reflects the beauty of the stars in
[1:03:02] it
[1:03:03] it's still a small pool that's deep and
[1:03:06] still
[1:03:07] that reflects the beauty of the stars
[1:03:09] what we need tonight
[1:03:10] is that deep rich experience
[1:03:14] that's something down in us that it
[1:03:16] don't have to shout
[1:03:17] yet it might but we put all emphasis on
[1:03:20] our shouting
[1:03:21] it might never speak with tongues yet it
[1:03:23] might but we put all emphasis on that
[1:03:27] it might not attended billy graham's
[1:03:29] meeting or robert's meeting your mind
[1:03:31] meeting you don't have to
[1:03:33] what it has to have is that depths of
[1:03:36] god's eternal love
[1:03:38] amen that spirit on the inside of him
[1:03:42] that makes you what you are that's what
[1:03:45] i was speaking about this morning
[1:03:47] that's what i was pulling the church
[1:03:50] across
[1:03:50] calvary back and forth don't you
[1:03:54] think because that you spoke with
[1:03:55] tongues are that you know
[1:03:57] so much about the scriptures or you read
[1:03:59] somebody's books and
[1:04:01] you know more than the other fella he
[1:04:03] said put a mark on those that
[1:04:05] sign cry for the abominations that did
[1:04:08] in the city
[1:04:10] who would he mark in our cities tonight
[1:04:13] see it's the depths of the spirit not
[1:04:15] the shallowness
[1:04:17] it's not the shell on the on the hickory
[1:04:20] nut that's
[1:04:21] good it's the heck or not under the
[1:04:23] shell
[1:04:25] got to begin to shell you got nothing
[1:04:27] under there
[1:04:28] what we need tonight is the depths of
[1:04:30] god's love
[1:04:32] and when elijah heard that still small
[1:04:34] voice nothing bothered him
[1:04:37] what have you heard in all of it you'll
[1:04:40] be going in a few days you hurt billy
[1:04:41] graham you're here or robert you'll hear
[1:04:43] others
[1:04:44] great man nothing against those men
[1:04:46] they're god's servants
[1:04:48] but don't listen to the noise
[1:04:51] hear that still small voice that
[1:04:55] depth of something that comes into the
[1:04:56] human heart that takes all
[1:04:58] foolishness away from you it takes all
[1:05:01] the world away from you
[1:05:03] it makes you hate the things of the
[1:05:05] world and love the things of god
[1:05:08] that's the depths that's the pool that
[1:05:10] reflects the stars of
[1:05:11] god's eternal glory that's the thing it
[1:05:14] brings forth tears to the eyes
[1:05:17] brings joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:05:22] it makes you stand when all other things
[1:05:24] will fail you it makes it
[1:05:26] when the sickness comes or even death
[1:05:28] itself it's still got the reflection
[1:05:31] of god's blessings in it
[1:05:34] that little pool that's deep
[1:05:38] and reflects the heavens not the ripple
[1:05:40] and noise of the water
[1:05:43] riffling waters are not very deep it's
[1:05:46] still waters it runs deep
[1:05:49] may god help us tonight friends as we're
[1:05:51] coming to the communion table
[1:05:54] to remember that no matter what outward
[1:05:57] we do
[1:05:57] how many good things we do you say where
[1:05:59] brother adam i go to church i try to
[1:06:01] live the best that i can
[1:06:02] good there's nothing against that
[1:06:04] brother i have spoke with tongues
[1:06:06] brother random i have shouted in the
[1:06:08] spirit
[1:06:08] that's good but that's not what i'm
[1:06:11] talking about brother
[1:06:12] that still isn't in that isn't what i'm
[1:06:15] speaking of
[1:06:16] i'm talking of that still small
[1:06:19] voice that's something rich and royal
[1:06:22] that i used to see the old mammoths when
[1:06:24] they come down this aisle here
[1:06:26] years ago the tears streaming from their
[1:06:29] cheeks
[1:06:29] when one sinner boy would raise up to
[1:06:31] come to the altar
[1:06:32] the day i make a call and see a boy come
[1:06:35] they said and pop their chewing gum
[1:06:38] what's the matter you lost the here
[1:06:42] then what have you heard what here us
[1:06:45] thou
[1:06:46] we're at the end time you hear on the
[1:06:49] television
[1:06:50] and on the radio in your magazines in
[1:06:52] your papers
[1:06:54] that there's going to be a whirl across
[1:06:56] this country someday
[1:06:58] what are you listening for to hear that
[1:07:00] all alarm your radio on
[1:07:02] all day long with all that nonsense of
[1:07:05] carrying on
[1:07:06] to hear when the bullets are going to
[1:07:08] drop for the bombs
[1:07:09] i'm not listening to that stuff i'm
[1:07:12] listening year boys say come
[1:07:14] up higher it was well done my good and
[1:07:16] faithful servant
[1:07:18] what you're a sound you know i think
[1:07:21] that we're so interested in
[1:07:23] listening so close to all the things of
[1:07:25] the world and things like that we can't
[1:07:26] hear that little still small voice
[1:07:28] well you're our pastor say just join the
[1:07:30] church it'll be all right
[1:07:32] we hear some of them say just speak with
[1:07:33] tongues it's all over some of them say
[1:07:35] just shout this all over you can't hear
[1:07:37] that little still small voice that
[1:07:40] places something
[1:07:41] rich and deep in the light makes you
[1:07:44] what you
[1:07:45] should be a wheat doesn't bear wheat
[1:07:47] because
[1:07:48] it's on a vine or on a stalk of weed
[1:07:52] also it's on a stalk but it takes the
[1:07:55] life in that
[1:07:56] vine to bring forth wheat
[1:08:00] the waters that fall under the water
[1:08:02] both of them they'll both rejoice in it
[1:08:03] they'll both grow in
[1:08:05] men and women can grow up shouting and
[1:08:07] praising god
[1:08:08] speaking in tongues and belonging to the
[1:08:10] church dancing in the spirit and paying
[1:08:13] times
[1:08:15] still not be in their heart that still
[1:08:18] small voice of god's rich deep
[1:08:21] love though i give my body to be burned
[1:08:24] as a sacrifice
[1:08:26] and have not love i'm nothing though i
[1:08:28] give all my goods to feed the poor

[1:11:34] you know did you hear from him
[1:11:37] what did he say what did he show you
[1:11:39] what did he
[1:11:43] what has he done where is he
[1:11:47] you know did you ever hear the
[1:11:52] sunrise
[1:11:58] can you feel this present can you feel
[1:12:01] that a little anointing start moving
[1:12:03] over the
[1:12:04] building right now are you sensitive
[1:12:08] enough to it that it speaks to the deep
[1:12:13] that calls to the deep something that
[1:12:16] produces the cream of life
[1:12:19] the real thing that this message brought
[1:12:22] resurrection and life that's what
[1:12:26] that's where our testimonies
[1:12:29] ought to come from you know
[1:12:35] i'm glad he still speaks i'm glad he's
[1:12:38] still
[1:12:39] changing i'm glad that he still can let
[1:12:42] me look in the mirror and i don't like
[1:12:44] what i
[1:12:44] see but i know there's grace
[1:12:47] there to do that so
[1:12:50] anyway i was going to ask brother
[1:12:52] matthew to come and
[1:12:54] and i wanted to share with you about our
[1:12:56] prayer meeting we had just
[1:12:58] a a wonderful
[1:13:01] prayer meeting last night
[1:13:05] i mean people just praying before god
[1:13:07] and
[1:13:08] worshiping the lord and calling upon the
[1:13:10] lord and
[1:13:11] and singing and and praying through and
[1:13:15] getting the victory and having the
[1:13:17] transforming power
[1:13:18] uh just come down on the inside and
[1:13:22] and and change the the heart
[1:13:26] and uh and that's what i wonder and i
[1:13:28] think this sunday we have some baptisms
[1:13:32] that are going to take place uh i think
[1:13:35] a little
[1:13:35] uh joshua i think it is
[1:13:40] is getting baptized i forget names real
[1:13:42] easy
[1:13:43] you know that but we had a sister that
[1:13:45] had a a wonderful testimony and
[1:13:48] she wrote it down and and brought it to
[1:13:50] the back and
[1:13:52] and i i could never read it and it
[1:13:55] expressed it the way but i was gonna see
[1:13:57] if matthew would come
[1:13:59] and read that testimony tell you a
[1:14:02] little bit about the prayer meetings
[1:14:04] every tuesday after communion and maybe
[1:14:07] you set aside
[1:14:08] and then right after that we'll be
[1:14:10] prepared
[1:14:11] to hear the
[1:14:14] testimonies any testimony you have
[1:14:17] on the heart of what god's done for your
[1:14:19] heart
[1:14:21] this weekend or this week or wherever
[1:14:23] it's been
[1:14:24] oh god bless you brother matthew amen
[1:14:28] amen praise the lord sure enjoyed that
[1:14:31] portion
[1:14:32] uh that we listened to amen
[1:14:36] i uh that still small voice is always
[1:14:40] means a lot to me
[1:14:42] just maybe 22 years ago i remember doing
[1:14:44] uh
[1:14:45] feet washing and communion with brother
[1:14:47] tim seiler and as he was just
[1:14:50] washing my feet there just a young
[1:14:51] christian i remember him praying lord
[1:14:53] may he be sensitive to that still small
[1:14:55] voice and that's
[1:14:57] never left me that means a lot and and
[1:15:00] much we could say but god is in each one
[1:15:03] of you
[1:15:04] and something that might seem so simple
[1:15:06] or something that you
[1:15:07] would think might go unnoticed i'm
[1:15:10] testifying that something a brother said
[1:15:13] over 20 years ago has meant a lot to me
[1:15:15] in my christian walk
[1:15:16] and so we that's what we're looking for
[1:15:20] you know brother branham as as he would
[1:15:22] be maybe out in nature going down
[1:15:25] down the road he'd feel a win maybe pass
[1:15:26] by him or something
[1:15:28] and he was wanting to be sensitive lord
[1:15:30] is that you
[1:15:32] and i i think that's just as our pastor
[1:15:34] has
[1:15:35] uh so beautifully been led
[1:15:38] to this portion of the the message and
[1:15:41] what the prophet has shown
[1:15:44] i thought that was just just the mind of
[1:15:46] the lord because
[1:15:49] we can get excited we can shout we can
[1:15:52] we can run the aisles
[1:15:53] the gifts can be in operation but we
[1:15:56] want god to do something
[1:15:57] personally to each one of us and i tell
[1:16:00] you
[1:16:01] when he does something personal to you
[1:16:03] and you hear the still small voice
[1:16:05] well then if you get excited and you
[1:16:08] start shouting
[1:16:09] and you start singing the victory and
[1:16:11] you might start running
[1:16:12] like you said you might you might you
[1:16:14] might not
[1:16:16] but it doesn't matter then as you heard
[1:16:18] you heard
[1:16:19] brother branham say he said once elijah
[1:16:22] heard this still small voice then
[1:16:23] nothing bothered him
[1:16:25] and that's why sometimes you know
[1:16:26] there's some impersonators there's some
[1:16:28] people that mimic
[1:16:29] but that's why some people just nothing
[1:16:31] bothers them they're just expressing
[1:16:33] the fire that's dropped in their heart
[1:16:35] by the word of the lord so
[1:16:37] uh yet something that um this testimony
[1:16:39] that was turned in is just
[1:16:41] as is wonderful and i maybe just want to
[1:16:43] read a portion of scripture
[1:16:44] out of james this is something that we
[1:16:46] put up on the on the screen
[1:16:49] here uh during the prayer service and uh
[1:16:52] we'll just read that and then we
[1:16:53] we couple that with a quote it's that
[1:16:55] it's a scripture we're very familiar
[1:16:57] with out of james chapter five
[1:16:59] they can put that up i believe it's
[1:17:00] going to be verse 15 and 16.
[1:17:09] it says and the prayer of faith shall
[1:17:11] save the sick
[1:17:12] and the lord shall raise him up and if
[1:17:15] he
[1:17:16] have committed sins they shall be
[1:17:17] forgiven him confess your faults one to
[1:17:19] another
[1:17:20] and pray one for another that ye may be
[1:17:23] healed
[1:17:24] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:17:26] righteous man
[1:17:27] availeth much and then we just couple
[1:17:30] that with this quote if you could move
[1:17:32] the slide there
[1:17:33] brother brahma says oh eternal god hear
[1:17:35] the prayer of your servants
[1:17:37] and no and now it's written again if the
[1:17:40] people
[1:17:41] that's called by my name shall assemble
[1:17:45] themselves together
[1:17:47] and pray then i'll hear from heaven
[1:17:50] oh god hear the prayer of your children
[1:17:53] tonight
[1:17:54] from heaven and i just could testify
[1:17:57] last night we seen the very
[1:17:59] manifestation
[1:18:01] of that quote there and we've been
[1:18:03] meeting
[1:18:04] um just a little bit over three years
[1:18:06] now
[1:18:08] doing prayer services we we were doing
[1:18:10] it
[1:18:12] every tuesday for certain needs and then
[1:18:16] as time progressed it was it seemed that
[1:18:18] doing it once a month
[1:18:20] could be very beneficial because instead
[1:18:22] of maybe having uh
[1:18:24] the many that would come to support it
[1:18:26] scattered out over
[1:18:27] three or four times throughout the month
[1:18:28] if if we all came together
[1:18:30] uh once a month after communion it just
[1:18:33] seemed to be very fitting in the mind of
[1:18:35] god
[1:18:36] and uh something that was on my heart as
[1:18:38] we we kept moving
[1:18:40] forward um it just the burden of my
[1:18:43] heart was
[1:18:43] is wanting to see uh the spirit of
[1:18:45] prayer really just wanting to see the
[1:18:48] people enter in
[1:18:49] in into an intercession and
[1:18:52] really uh crying out to god and and
[1:18:55] calling his presence down and really
[1:18:57] fulfilling that quote
[1:18:59] uh that we just read that the people
[1:19:01] assembling themselves together
[1:19:04] and calling unto god and knowing that
[1:19:06] he's hearing from heaven
[1:19:08] and just even out with the portion of
[1:19:10] tape we just listened to of
[1:19:12] of how you're marked about your sign and
[1:19:15] crying i
[1:19:16] i'm reminded of when brother branham
[1:19:17] said how many in here have the holy
[1:19:19] ghost
[1:19:20] all right raise your hand everybody all
[1:19:21] right do you sigh and cry for the
[1:19:24] abomination in the world that'll tell
[1:19:25] you if you got it yeah i'm like oh god
[1:19:26] help me
[1:19:28] i'm not doing that and so uh we
[1:19:31] this that's an opportunity to come
[1:19:33] together and as the spirit of god would
[1:19:35] move upon you you find yourself
[1:19:37] crying out for things you might not even
[1:19:39] know really but it's the spirit of god
[1:19:41] uttering through you
[1:19:42] things you didn't even know to utter and
[1:19:45] i just want to read this here
[1:19:47] just um from our sister
[1:19:50] she says dear saints of god i want to
[1:19:53] give this testimony to encourage someone
[1:19:56] and for the glory of god who does what
[1:19:59] no man can do
[1:20:00] he is god and forever remains god
[1:20:04] he is living in his servants those that
[1:20:07] are
[1:20:07] really sincere and serving him in truth
[1:20:10] and in spirit
[1:20:11] it is good to be in the services of god
[1:20:14] whenever it's called for
[1:20:16] what happened in the prayer meeting
[1:20:17] yesterday was really supernatural
[1:20:20] the hand of god i came to the meeting
[1:20:23] with burdens on my heart
[1:20:25] and for answers that can only come from
[1:20:27] god
[1:20:29] i came to church to just sit down and
[1:20:31] something said go straight to the altar
[1:20:33] so i went straight to the altar praying
[1:20:36] and pouring my heart out to god
[1:20:38] then when the praying was going on
[1:20:42] with everywhere on fire i felt a hand on
[1:20:46] me and the hand is just not man's hand
[1:20:49] but a supernatural touching hand then
[1:20:52] there came on me a sweetness
[1:20:55] a move all over me and the burdens were
[1:20:58] all gone
[1:20:59] then i found myself praising god and
[1:21:01] saying thank you lord
[1:21:03] thank you lord my burdens were lifted
[1:21:06] off me
[1:21:07] she says it's then i saw a brother's
[1:21:10] hand on me praying for me
[1:21:12] and touching all those problems i was
[1:21:14] surprised because as i
[1:21:16] as that brother laid hands on me the
[1:21:18] sweetness came all over me how did he
[1:21:20] know what i was praying about
[1:21:22] i am testifying to you because i have
[1:21:24] started seeing the answers to these
[1:21:26] prayers i prayed yesterday
[1:21:28] god is moving in our midst if we can
[1:21:32] only come to him
[1:21:33] with expectation in our hearts and
[1:21:36] acknowledge his presence in our services
[1:21:40] and to honor him when we're called to
[1:21:42] these prayer services
[1:21:44] she says the greater testimonies are
[1:21:46] coming sister rosemary
[1:21:48] i thought my what what a word from the
[1:21:50] lord
[1:21:51] i thought that was so beautifully uh uh
[1:21:53] uh exhorted to us that testimony
[1:21:56] of what god is doing and as as i would
[1:21:58] uh turn this back over to our pastor
[1:22:01] i would say i can testify of what god
[1:22:03] has done for me over the weekend god
[1:22:05] i spoke directly to my heart i did
[1:22:08] something extremely uh supernatural for
[1:22:10] me
[1:22:10] and and confirming things and we just
[1:22:13] give god all the glory i say i am in
[1:22:15] such
[1:22:15] great expectation for what god is doing

[1:24:21] to the glory of god
[1:24:23] uh
[1:24:27] two months ago the end of february
[1:24:30] i had a trip back home in my home
[1:24:32] country cameroon
[1:24:35] i was visiting my family because my
[1:24:38] sibling just lost a
[1:24:39] one-week year old baby so uh
[1:24:43] i had a quick trip back there uh
[1:24:46] i was there only for one week
[1:24:49] so uh when i was coming back
[1:24:52] the day i was coming back the morning
[1:24:56] i started feeling sick
[1:24:59] and it wasn't that bad yet
[1:25:03] so uh around noon
[1:25:06] i started reacting and my stomach was
[1:25:09] running
[1:25:10] i started throwing up i went to the
[1:25:13] pharmacy i got some medicine
[1:25:16] to try to calm me down but it wasn't
[1:25:19] still working
[1:25:20] so uh during that time brother moses
[1:25:23] called me
[1:25:23] to check on me i told him that i'm not
[1:25:26] feeling that well
[1:25:27] i'm thinking of of postponing my flight
[1:25:31] he said okay let me do what is right but
[1:25:34] he he will be praying at the same time
[1:25:37] his sister in florida called me also and
[1:25:40] they all they all started praying for me
[1:25:44] his dad was a pastor in another town
[1:25:46] also
[1:25:47] he was supposed to meet me before my
[1:25:50] trip
[1:25:51] i told him that i might consulate
[1:25:53] because i'm not feeling well
[1:25:55] he said okay let me know but we will
[1:25:57] stop praying for you
[1:25:59] so um a voice started talking i said
[1:26:02] cancel it so i was like okay
[1:26:06] let me wait let me go out and have a
[1:26:08] walk
[1:26:09] so when i come back let me see how i
[1:26:11] feel so
[1:26:12] i went out when i came back i was like
[1:26:15] oh okay i feel good
[1:26:17] i might not even have to cancel my
[1:26:18] flight so
[1:26:20] when i went i sat on the bed i said a
[1:26:23] voice said cancel it
[1:26:25] i said at this time i'm not going to
[1:26:27] debate i'll cancel it
[1:26:30] so then i called the airlines i
[1:26:33] i wanted a consulate usually they will
[1:26:35] charge you the change fee
[1:26:37] but somehow they say they're not going
[1:26:38] to charge me anything i say okay that
[1:26:40] even works better
[1:26:42] so i changed the date around the time
[1:26:45] that i was supposed to be flying
[1:26:48] the temperature came out started again
[1:26:50] it went up
[1:26:52] my stomach started running again
[1:26:56] i started throwing up i tried to take
[1:26:58] the medicine even water
[1:27:00] as soon as i take water i could throw up
[1:27:02] and see all the medicine i just took
[1:27:04] everything is back up

[1:27:30] give me water to give me something
[1:27:32] i could barely move my hand i could
[1:27:34] barely even turn my head
[1:27:36] they were standing for for a couple of
[1:27:38] minutes calling me
[1:27:40] i couldn't respond but i could hear them
[1:27:43] my eyes were closed captioning not
[1:27:59] when available finished praying my
[1:28:01] little sister took over
[1:28:04] i could hear them praying then it was my
[1:28:07] turn
[1:28:08] i was praying while laying down like i
[1:28:11] was cold
[1:28:12] even though i wasn't covering myself my
[1:28:14] eyes were closed
[1:28:16] i started praying in french
[1:28:19] but when i finished i couldn't still do
[1:28:22] anything
[1:28:23] then i started singing little by little
[1:28:25] when i was singing my voice was coming
[1:28:27] up and up and up
[1:28:29] now i was able to sit
[1:28:33] now in the bed then i started praying
[1:28:37] for the second time
[1:28:38] in english i prayed i prayed i prayed
[1:28:43] that
[1:28:44] i started feeling a little relieved
[1:28:48] then i started singing again my little
[1:28:50] sister speaks
[1:28:51] english was picking up some of the songs
[1:28:55] we started singing
[1:28:57] then i said i'm not done yet i have to
[1:29:00] kneel down and pray again
[1:29:02] so i kneeled down i prayed again in
[1:29:05] english
[1:29:06] for the third time then i had the
[1:29:09] strength even to kneel on because i
[1:29:10] didn't have that strength before
[1:29:13] so i prayed i prayed i prayed
[1:29:16] when i woke up now i stood up i sat back

[1:29:38] better do you want to drink medicine i
[1:29:40] said no that's fine
[1:29:42] so um my little sister wanted my younger

[1:29:55] all night so uh this is the testimony in
[1:29:58] another testimony
[1:30:00] so during that time before i got really
[1:30:03] sick
[1:30:05] i had a friend my co-worker who called
[1:30:08] me
[1:30:09] that the staffing agency is letting us
[1:30:11] know that on monday
[1:30:12] when i come back i don't have a job no

[1:30:22] call but i got a text
[1:30:24] i saw it i said i would deal with that
[1:30:26] later
[1:30:28] so during that time my they left me in
[1:30:31] the room
[1:30:32] i woke up when i woke up now
[1:30:35] i took my phone i saw two voice messages
[1:30:38] from
[1:30:39] a job that i uh applied and i

[1:32:18] you
[1:32:22] amen amen who else can
[1:32:26] testify for what god's done for him bro
[1:32:28] jeff
[1:32:31] you've raised your hand yeah okay your
[1:32:33] name is jeff
[1:32:35] all right let's have a testimony
[1:32:44] several months ago there was a
[1:32:48] something that the prophet said had been
[1:32:49] on my heart
[1:32:52] about getting down to that deep kernel
[1:32:56] of sincerity
[1:32:57] you know and it just really struck my
[1:33:00] heart and
[1:33:02] and it caused me to you know kind of uh
[1:33:05] go into some bird pains for a while and
[1:33:08] uh
[1:33:09] but i began to to pray and uh
[1:33:12] you know and ask for a greater sincerity
[1:33:16] in my prayer and i realized that there's
[1:33:17] a lot of layers to the heart
[1:33:20] and i lived a long time in the in the
[1:33:22] world you get a lot of
[1:33:24] a lot of insincerity that you don't even
[1:33:27] know you have
[1:33:27] you know and even after you know serving
[1:33:30] the lord for a while
[1:33:31] you you know you start finding little
[1:33:33] hidden things of dishonesty and so forth
[1:33:36] anyway so i you know i'm i'm spending a
[1:33:39] lot of
[1:33:40] a lot of time uh praying and uh and
[1:33:42] really uh
[1:33:44] you know groaning before the lord and
[1:33:46] he's showing me things and
[1:33:48] uh and any anyhow so i noticed that i
[1:33:51] was i gained a sensitivity
[1:33:53] that i never had before and i started to
[1:33:56] notice that in my daily walk
[1:33:59] little things that i would see even
[1:34:01] people doing things
[1:34:02] it was like there was a still small
[1:34:04] voice that you see that right there
[1:34:06] that's like this you see how this bird's
[1:34:09] doing that or whatever
[1:34:10] that's like this and a lot of times
[1:34:12] would be questions on my heart
[1:34:13] or maybe uh you know a burden for
[1:34:17] somebody else and
[1:34:18] you know the lord showing me things and
[1:34:21] uh
[1:34:22] and and i really enjoyed that because i
[1:34:23] saw that in the prophet
[1:34:25] you know when i've seen the same thing
[1:34:26] in my life well anyhow this uh
[1:34:29] so i'm gonna just use that kind of look
[1:34:31] for a foundation so
[1:34:32] i uh the covet thing came out
[1:34:36] and uh and uh
[1:34:41] there's a uh i can't wear a mask you
[1:34:45] know anything
[1:34:46] over my face to uh to stop uh to
[1:34:49] inhibit my breathing and uh and
[1:34:52] i don't want to say what it is but
[1:34:54] basically when the announcement came
[1:34:57] forth of covid
[1:34:58] they said if you have this you know
[1:35:02] and you catch covet it's basically a
[1:35:04] death sentence
[1:35:07] so that caught my attention and
[1:35:10] and so one morning i was uh i went to a
[1:35:13] job site
[1:35:15] and uh and i always
[1:35:18] go to work like an hour hour and a half
[1:35:20] early and
[1:35:21] uh and so i'm sitting there in the in
[1:35:23] the dark you know
[1:35:24] and uh and and i started to pray
[1:35:28] about that you know um because that
[1:35:31] that's kind of serious you know
[1:35:32] and uh and uh and something told me i
[1:35:35] had a little
[1:35:36] uh a gideon's pocket bible in my car
[1:35:39] and something said pick up your bible
[1:35:42] and so i picked up my bible and i opened
[1:35:44] it up
[1:35:46] i believe it was psalms 51.
[1:35:50] anyway i opened it up and right where i
[1:35:52] started reading
[1:35:53] it was just like the lord was was
[1:35:56] quickening this
[1:35:57] this verse to me and uh
[1:36:02] but what i was hearing in my heart was
[1:36:05] you know
[1:36:05] that that i'm going to protect you from
[1:36:07] this virus
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:14] and this revelation was so profound
[1:36:18] that uh from that point until now
[1:36:23] um you know i'm not saying that people
[1:36:25] haven't gone sir
[1:36:26] sir you know and i've handled it in a
[1:36:28] very polite way because the cdc
[1:36:30] has calls me exempt so did the state
[1:36:33] mandate
[1:36:34] you know and so i would always tell them
[1:36:36] i'll remain six feet but
[1:36:37] i can't wear a face cover but i have
[1:36:39] gone i have not
[1:36:41] i didn't slow down at all i went to all
[1:36:43] all the stores
[1:36:44] just like i normally would and uh
[1:36:47] and if i felt led to go into a ward
[1:36:51] where the people were all sick with
[1:36:52] covet i could go in there and lay hands
[1:36:54] on every person in there without one
[1:36:56] speck of fear
[1:36:57] just a profound a word from the lord
[1:37:00] that
[1:37:01] was just a divine revelation and his
[1:37:04] sovereignty that he gave me and
[1:37:07] then a short while after that you know
[1:37:09] uh
[1:37:11] you know the mask first it was they were
[1:37:14] shortening
[1:37:15] uh listening how many people could be
[1:37:17] gathered well in my trade
[1:37:20] the job sites that i work on are usually
[1:37:22] 300
[1:37:23] 500 800 workers so
[1:37:26] needless to say most of the projects
[1:37:28] that i would normally be working on
[1:37:29] which is my particular skill set
[1:37:31] and construction they were all shut down
[1:37:33] postponed
[1:37:35] you know so they're having to tell the
[1:37:36] investors you know hey you know that
[1:37:38] completion date
[1:37:39] you know and so meanwhile i'm out of
[1:37:41] work
[1:37:42] and uh and then even when they when they
[1:37:46] you know begin to uh you know
[1:37:49] expand okay 100 people can gather so on
[1:37:51] and so forth
[1:37:53] um the fact that i can't wear a mask i'm
[1:37:55] not allowed on the job sites
[1:37:58] and started working labor
[1:38:01] and uh and then it happened there too
[1:38:04] couldn't uh couldn't go on the job sites
[1:38:06] without a mask
[1:38:07] so i i had applied for a job they called
[1:38:10] me they sent me to a place i went out
[1:38:11] there they said i think you don't have
[1:38:13] to wear a mask here and i was like okay
[1:38:14] great i get out there
[1:38:16] same thing i'm there like an hour and a
[1:38:17] half early it's dark and uh
[1:38:20] and then i find out they're not going to
[1:38:21] let me in this job site either without a
[1:38:23] mask
[1:38:23] i i talked to i went all the way up the
[1:38:25] chain of command talked to their
[1:38:27] project safety manager he said no and uh
[1:38:31] you know and the thought came to mind i
[1:38:32] could sue them you know but that's not
[1:38:34] really the christian thing to do and
[1:38:36] it's just
[1:38:36] a bleeding thought and i was like yeah
[1:38:38] that's not uh no
[1:38:40] and you know so i went back to my car
[1:38:43] and it was almost
[1:38:45] the same type of way i just began to
[1:38:47] pray right there in my car
[1:38:49] felt again to pick up my my little king
[1:38:51] james bottle this is months later
[1:38:53] and i picked it up and right where i
[1:38:54] picked it up was where
[1:38:56] caesar was before i believe it was
[1:38:59] festus
[1:39:00] and uh and uh and he was brought up on
[1:39:03] charges and and he said you know i
[1:39:05] appeal to caesar
[1:39:07] and when i read that appeal to caesar it
[1:39:10] was just like the lord spoke to my
[1:39:12] heart and said appeal to caesar
[1:39:15] and so i'm like okay
[1:39:19] okay you know and so i i went home and
[1:39:22] on the way home i was like
[1:39:23] okay appeal to caesar and i go well it's
[1:39:27] too small of an issue for president
[1:39:29] trump
[1:39:31] you know so i just went down and i
[1:39:33] thought but you know what there
[1:39:34] there's uh there's state legislative
[1:39:36] people there there's
[1:39:38] you know u.s senators and so forth and
[1:39:40] so i said well lord you know however you
[1:39:42] leave me
[1:39:43] you know i believe this is from you i
[1:39:44] believe i heard your word to me
[1:39:46] i know it's you and uh and so i got back
[1:39:50] home i went on my computer
[1:39:52] and i went to uh you know this
[1:39:54] particular congress person's website
[1:39:57] and didn't feel anything so i went to
[1:40:00] another
[1:40:01] website you know they have those
[1:40:03] official government websites and then i
[1:40:05] went to this one u.s senator
[1:40:07] and i just felt a peace you know
[1:40:10] and so uh you know i'm kind of wordy and
[1:40:14] so the lord helped me make it just a
[1:40:16] short paragraph that really
[1:40:18] described everything and i was like
[1:40:20] that's amazing that
[1:40:25] and i sent it off and i also brought up
[1:40:28] that i had been denied
[1:40:29] unemployment and i wasn't trying to file
[1:40:32] against the labor place i just was
[1:40:34] looking for the disaster really because
[1:40:35] i can't wear a mask
[1:40:37] well uh a short while
[1:40:41] after that you know went through a
[1:40:42] little trial with it you know
[1:40:46] they called me and they're like you know
[1:40:48] and i got a hold of a person i knew it
[1:40:49] was
[1:40:50] a trial i recognized it i was trying to
[1:40:52] you know it's a character test
[1:40:54] and uh did pretty well and uh
[1:40:57] and uh and then uh it got another call
[1:41:01] and this person was very nice and
[1:41:04] they're like hey you know i think i can
[1:41:05] get you this
[1:41:06] and this and i was like well i'm not
[1:41:08] really trying to get this and that he
[1:41:09] goes no
[1:41:10] i i can get you this and that and i'm
[1:41:12] like okay
[1:41:13] you know and a day and he said now it
[1:41:16] may take a couple of weeks for this to
[1:41:18] go through
[1:41:19] a day and a half later a huge lump sum i
[1:41:22] was so in debt
[1:41:24] i mean my credit cards were maxed out i
[1:41:26] owed everybody that i knew
[1:41:28] i had all my tools almost to knock in a
[1:41:31] day and a half later
[1:41:32] a huge lump sum hit my bank account and
[1:41:35] the lord has provided for my needs ever
[1:41:39] [Applause]
[1:41:44] since
[1:41:48] hallelujah anybody else have the lord
[1:41:52] bless in their heart
[1:41:53] sister go ahead hallelujah
[1:42:03] praise the lord god bless you i'm kind
[1:42:06] of shaking right now
[1:42:08] but i just want to testify what the lord
[1:42:10] has done for me the past two weeks
[1:42:13] i remember there was a day it was a
[1:42:15] sunday but the david was preaching on
[1:42:17] the cry to overcome
[1:42:19] and i was struggling with this spirit
[1:42:21] and that spirit was a spirit of lust
[1:42:23] not after that before that i had friends
[1:42:26] that had gone to oklahoma youth camp
[1:42:29] and we were on a group call and we were
[1:42:32] just talking they were just saying god
[1:42:34] delivered me from this god delivered me
[1:42:36] with this
[1:42:36] and then two other girls like god didn't
[1:42:38] god delivered me from
[1:42:40] last pornography and i was like god i
[1:42:42] see what you're doing for others
[1:42:44] then what about me and then i came to
[1:42:47] sunday
[1:42:48] and the brother david preached a song on
[1:42:50] the instrument on the cry to overcome
[1:42:52] i was like god i want to overcome i
[1:42:55] don't want the spirit on me
[1:42:57] i don't worship the devil i don't want
[1:42:58] the spirit on me
[1:43:00] and so i had been avoiding the altar
[1:43:04] like i was like you know something's
[1:43:06] telling me you should go to the hotel
[1:43:07] and get this paid out of you
[1:43:08] and i said and i kept on putting up was
[1:43:10] like i'm going to go next time
[1:43:12] next service next service and you know
[1:43:15] week after week you went by and
[1:43:18] there was a day i was listening to a
[1:43:20] sermon the accumulation of faith
[1:43:23] and that summary just encouraged me and
[1:43:26] i just felt like to write
[1:43:27] the thing i was like i was going to
[1:43:28] louisia i'm going to louisiana youth
[1:43:30] meetings
[1:43:31] i'm going to write down a list of what i
[1:43:32] got what i want god to deliver me from
[1:43:36] and i wrote it down i put in the back of
[1:43:37] my phone case and when i got home i put
[1:43:39] in my bible
[1:43:40] and then when we got to the hotel on
[1:43:42] friday i looked at that list i was like
[1:43:44] god
[1:43:44] today is the first day of the youth
[1:43:47] meetings i want you to do something for
[1:43:48] me this weekend
[1:43:50] and went to service and i began losing
[1:43:52] my voice
[1:43:54] and i was like god if you give me my
[1:43:56] voice back
[1:43:57] i'm going to testify and then i got my
[1:44:00] voice back
[1:44:01] and then that night by the day and his
[1:44:04] demon preached a sermon and after the
[1:44:06] sermon they had an
[1:44:07] auto call and you know i just felt so
[1:44:10] just
[1:44:10] i didn't feel discouraged but i just
[1:44:12] didn't want to go to the altar but
[1:44:14] there's something came in me said you've
[1:44:15] been avoiding the author for too long
[1:44:17] i think it's time and i went there i got
[1:44:20] prayed and that spirit just
[1:44:22] went out right out of me and then
[1:44:34] and then this song came up came in my
[1:44:36] mind it says you're my courage when i
[1:44:38] worry
[1:44:39] in the dead of night you're my strength
[1:44:41] because i'm not strong enough to win
[1:44:43] this fight
[1:44:44] you're greater than the battle that's
[1:44:45] raging in my mind i will trust you lord
[1:44:48] i'll fear no more
[1:44:50] and i also had a desire way before that
[1:44:52] that's been two years
[1:44:53] for two years i've been praying about
[1:44:55] that god i'd love to see my little
[1:44:57] brother saved
[1:44:58] and when we got home you know i have
[1:45:01] forgotten about it i have forgotten that
[1:45:02] i prayed for this
[1:45:04] and you know i went to my room getting
[1:45:07] ready to go to sleep i was like
[1:45:08] i need water and i went to grab water
[1:45:11] and i saw my little brother sitting
[1:45:12] there leaving music linda i need to talk
[1:45:14] to you
[1:45:14] and ask him what's up he's like i had a
[1:45:16] great weekend god really moved on my
[1:45:18] heart
[1:45:19] i was like i want to get baptized
[1:45:32] i thought mommy i didn't know whether to
[1:45:34] shout or cry
[1:45:36] i was like i just went praising the lord
[1:45:38] as a god i've been praying two years for
[1:45:41] this
[1:45:42] and i have a quote a song that i found
[1:45:46] and i feel like that song just summed up
[1:45:48] my week
[1:45:49] my weekend at the louisiana youth
[1:45:51] meetings says
[1:45:54] i found my freedom in you i found a joy
[1:45:57] i can't lose
[1:45:58] and thank god it's true you wrapped your
[1:46:00] arms around me and heaven broke through
[1:46:03] from the moment you found me lord i
[1:46:05] found my freedom in you
[1:46:06] i found my new name i found my good
[1:46:08] grace found that healing and the tears
[1:46:10] fell down from my face
[1:46:12] when i found my beginning that has no
[1:46:14] ending i found my second chance i found
[1:46:16] my best friend
[1:46:18] i found my forgiveness i found my
[1:46:20] happiness
[1:46:21] i've been singing ever since i found my
[1:46:23] freedom in you
[1:46:32] hallelujah amen
[1:46:37] that sister's become dangerous you
[1:46:40] better watch out satan
[1:46:42] amen we've got someone's got dangerous
[1:46:46] that's who's dangerous is the people
[1:46:49] that hear from the lord in their heart
[1:46:52] amen because now they know where it come
[1:46:53] from and if you ever have that
[1:46:56] nothing can take it away
[1:46:59] amen any more dangerous people in here
[1:47:03] brother go ahead praise the lord
[1:47:11] god bless you signs yeah i'm glad i'm
[1:47:14] not as much nervous as last time
[1:47:16] yeah i just want to share a quick
[1:47:19] testimony here
[1:47:21] i have a thousands of them i could
[1:47:23] actually go and share from the moment
[1:47:25] god has brought me here
[1:47:26] but one that really resided with me as
[1:47:28] brother david was speaking earlier
[1:47:30] you know that the spirit of the lord
[1:47:32] still moves and still operates on people
[1:47:37] you know it's a testimony coming down
[1:47:39] here to texas
[1:47:41] actually for me and my family you know
[1:47:43] uh
[1:47:45] this goes back from really like before
[1:47:48] my childhood i was never the kid that
[1:47:50] settled for
[1:47:50] proficiency or just he has a a in a
[1:47:54] class
[1:47:54] i always wanted to do a little bit extra
[1:47:57] either to be the teacher's pet or to
[1:47:59] just
[1:48:00] piss somebody off or you know it was
[1:48:02] like a competition for me and
[1:48:04] it got to a time where as i was going to
[1:48:07] school
[1:48:08] you know i graduated from high school
[1:48:10] with all these
[1:48:11] honors scholarships and everything and
[1:48:13] then
[1:48:14] you know i started going to college you
[1:48:16] know at first it was yeah i wanted to do
[1:48:18] cyber security and
[1:48:20] you know and then i got pulled into you
[1:48:22] know there was this desire upon my heart
[1:48:24] where it was just like
[1:48:26] david you've been called for more than
[1:48:27] this and
[1:48:29] you know there was this call deep inside
[1:48:31] of me just you know davey you have been
[1:48:33] called for more than this and
[1:48:34] it was this hot cry and then i was like
[1:48:37] maybe cyber security is not the way i
[1:48:39] should go
[1:48:40] and then i was thinking you know there
[1:48:42] was this life from the devil
[1:48:44] about you go for theology so you know
[1:48:46] how to bring the word of god to people
[1:48:49] and i was just like listening to brother
[1:48:51] branham and and i could hear our brother
[1:48:53] obama was just blasting against that
[1:48:54] spirit of
[1:48:56] you know learning god from a man and i
[1:48:59] said
[1:49:00] maybe not theology i i found a shortcut
[1:49:03] and then i went for psychology from the
[1:49:06] moment
[1:49:07] i said i want to do psychology the
[1:49:09] spirit was just like
[1:49:10] david you know myself i could really
[1:49:13] tell myself it's just like david aren't
[1:49:15] you ashamed of yourself
[1:49:17] you know and i went so deep into
[1:49:19] psychology where
[1:49:21] you know i could deal maybe my siblings
[1:49:24] can share a little bit of it i could
[1:49:25] deal with somebody
[1:49:28] two minutes before you even spoke a word
[1:49:30] to me it was like
[1:49:31] i could just look into a person and you
[1:49:34] know there was these things that we were
[1:49:35] learning and you know i kind of really
[1:49:37] got too much into you know it was
[1:49:39] psychology everything became about
[1:49:41] psychology
[1:49:43] and then it wasn't until core and i
[1:49:44] started coming
[1:49:46] you know that i took one class
[1:49:49] and then i was in that class and as i
[1:49:51] when i took that class the lord started
[1:49:53] just speaking dealing to my heart it's
[1:49:55] just like
[1:49:56] you know how far do you want to go you
[1:49:59] know how far do you want me to reach
[1:50:01] down
[1:50:01] and i've never really settled for
[1:50:04] failing in the class
[1:50:06] and then i went on i was in the b a
[1:50:08] minus range in the class
[1:50:10] the end of the semester came i failed
[1:50:13] i was just like this is strange i took
[1:50:16] it again
[1:50:17] the next semester following semester
[1:50:20] in the summer and
[1:50:23] it was so blurry like things i did study
[1:50:27] last semester and i
[1:50:28] almost passed because of one quiz and
[1:50:30] misunderstanding that i failed
[1:50:33] and i found myself really completely in
[1:50:35] the f i was just like i have to withdraw
[1:50:38] so i withdrew from the clash again and
[1:50:41] then i came again to take it
[1:50:43] and then i started praying to god i said
[1:50:45] god if you really don't want me to do
[1:50:47] this
[1:50:47] give me a sign and then i was sitting
[1:50:50] there as i was praying i was speaking
[1:50:52] myself and then like
[1:50:54] something started telling me did you
[1:50:56] really hear yourself how many more signs
[1:50:58] do you need
[1:50:59] to pull away from it you know
[1:51:03] you know now it sounds really you know
[1:51:05] to me it sounds maybe funny but
[1:51:07] i know the standard my dad has for me
[1:51:09] understanding my parents said before me
[1:51:12] i just was sitting there i was just like
[1:51:14] god it can be you i've given three years
[1:51:16] of my life
[1:51:17] in college i've lost the scholarship
[1:51:20] with that first failure and then
[1:51:22] you know now i had to pay back money
[1:51:24] because i failed a class with the
[1:51:25] scholarship i had
[1:51:27] i was just crying i was so lost you know
[1:51:29] it was last
[1:51:30] last year toward the end and then you
[1:51:33] know
[1:51:35] we started listening to this message
[1:51:38] and you know it was about trusting god
[1:51:42] and all of a sudden my dad walks up one
[1:51:45] day and be like
[1:51:47] we're packing all of your stuff we're
[1:51:49] moving out of states i was just like dad
[1:51:53] you know i was just in a place where
[1:51:54] like nothing was making sense
[1:51:56] but then you know the lord started
[1:51:58] dealing with me to completely pull out
[1:52:00] of that psychology
[1:52:01] and i it was hard and i was just like
[1:52:04] you know what lord i give up
[1:52:06] you know because when you look into life
[1:52:08] at least for me when i look into life
[1:52:10] i i'm looking at my friends as well
[1:52:13] those we started college with
[1:52:15] you know you see them graduate and every
[1:52:17] time you have a friend that says oh come
[1:52:19] to my graduation ceremony
[1:52:20] your heart goes like that could have
[1:52:22] been me you know
[1:52:24] it kind of was like picking like dealing
[1:52:26] with my ego
[1:52:27] a lot you know to see you work from
[1:52:30] something you build you build you build
[1:52:32] and then at the end it came to nothing
[1:52:34] and then i was really hurt
[1:52:36] and my parent was just like yeah we need
[1:52:38] uh we need to be moving we're moving out
[1:52:40] of colorado you know the house is on
[1:52:41] sale everything is up
[1:52:43] you guys need to stop preparing for it
[1:52:46] and i was praying to god i was just like
[1:52:48] that is taking me somewhere
[1:52:49] i don't know anybody but few friends
[1:52:52] that i had here already in the church
[1:52:53] and
[1:52:54] i don't know where to start life and
[1:52:56] that i'm getting old
[1:52:58] you know by the way i'm saying you know
[1:53:01] by the way i'm 22 years old you know and
[1:53:04] i was just looking at stuff i was just
[1:53:05] like
[1:53:06] you know i was looking at life i'm like
[1:53:10] it's this is not going to work so i i
[1:53:12] started fussing about it i was just like
[1:53:15] dad what are you trying to do like are
[1:53:17] you running away from something
[1:53:19] little did i know it was really for my
[1:53:20] benefit you know and
[1:53:23] i came here i remember the first prayer
[1:53:25] night i had i spoke with brother matthew
[1:53:27] brennan matthew looked at me asked me
[1:53:29] what did you do
[1:53:32] that that question every time i heard it
[1:53:35] it was just like somebody telling you a
[1:53:37] failure
[1:53:38] you know he asked me what do you what
[1:53:40] are you doing you know
[1:53:42] i just like to be honest with you
[1:53:45] i'm lost you know i told him i was just
[1:53:47] like i don't know what i'm doing i don't
[1:53:49] know what i want to do like
[1:53:51] i was just like i'm in this place of
[1:53:53] confusion and
[1:53:56] you know as i was sitting and thinking
[1:53:58] about stuff
[1:53:59] one day brother david gave just enough
[1:54:01] it was just like you know if
[1:54:03] you guys are if you guys need any help
[1:54:06] you feel the lord has been dealing with
[1:54:08] in a certain way just come talk to me
[1:54:11] and stuff
[1:54:12] i went to see him that day and
[1:54:15] he was at home with with his wife and
[1:54:18] then i walked in his wife offered me tea
[1:54:20] and as i was drinking tea i just
[1:54:22] you know before going to him i was just
[1:54:24] like lord i'm
[1:54:26] lost like at this moment if you really
[1:54:29] don't do anything
[1:54:30] i might as well become a bum because i
[1:54:33] don't want to do
[1:54:34] something else and then you tell me to
[1:54:35] stop doing it you know i was just like
[1:54:37] i don't wanna there is so many ideas but
[1:54:40] if i put my head into it you pull me out
[1:54:42] i don't know
[1:54:43] and then i went to see brother davidesro
[1:54:46] speaking
[1:54:47] and i was talking with him more on the
[1:54:49] side of the call that god put in my
[1:54:50] heart in my life and
[1:54:52] you know
[1:54:56] it was when i just reached like they
[1:54:58] picked the highest level of sincerity
[1:55:00] with him and i just started telling him
[1:55:02] everything that was going on with my
[1:55:04] heart that the atmosphere in the room
[1:55:06] changed
[1:55:08] and maybe he didn't notice but i know he
[1:55:10] didn't notice that day
[1:55:12] you know he went on to telling me things
[1:55:16] about my past things that i've never
[1:55:20] shared with
[1:55:20] nobody and he just started speaking
[1:55:24] he started speaking and he tells me that
[1:55:26] was the lord protecting you
[1:55:30] you know you will be this and then you
[1:55:32] know that i keep it for myself
[1:55:34] i just sat down in his table i was like
[1:55:36] a foolish person i just was crying
[1:55:40] i was just like this has to be god
[1:55:43] you know and after he told he told me
[1:55:47] after that day
[1:55:48] i don't even want to say he because it
[1:55:50] was god speaking
[1:55:52] and after these things had happened
[1:55:55] you know god has given such a sense into
[1:55:57] my life
[1:55:58] now i feel like i am even way ahead of
[1:56:01] those that i felt like left me behind
[1:56:03] you know and just you know things the
[1:56:05] lord has been opening for me
[1:56:07] you know the opportunities you know the
[1:56:09] businesses and
[1:56:11] the everything that i've been just
[1:56:12] working on lately you know
[1:56:16] it's amazing i can't i can't put like
[1:56:18] see down and start counting and say
[1:56:21] when i come to dallas you know this is a
[1:56:23] success i will have
[1:56:24] you know and brother matthew one thing
[1:56:26] he told me is
[1:56:28] success is not measured you know by the
[1:56:31] things of this world
[1:56:33] and i do really believe it's true
[1:56:34] because i've spoken with so many friends
[1:56:36] i was telling me david the moment you've
[1:56:38] been here
[1:56:39] this is the impact you've done into my
[1:56:41] life this is what you've done
[1:56:43] this is what you've done this is and
[1:56:46] there is so many
[1:56:47] even testimony i've seen friends that
[1:56:50] was not serious with the lord
[1:56:52] you know come out and you know just
[1:56:54] under the sweetness and say i need this
[1:56:56] help
[1:56:57] you know and i've seen the lord work in
[1:56:59] my life more
[1:57:00] in the last three months i've been here
[1:57:03] than i ever did in my whole life
[1:57:05] you know and uh i can't i'm just so
[1:57:08] excited
[1:57:09] you know to see what he can do more you
[1:57:12] know since that day on that table
[1:57:15] you know when sometime i'm really
[1:57:17] ungrateful
[1:57:18] god forgive me because i don't stand
[1:57:20] here very much
[1:57:21] i try to run from this place but
[1:57:24] my heart has always been excited since
[1:57:26] that day you know
[1:57:28] the things god does for me and the way
[1:57:30] he does things
[1:57:31] you know that's really uh that's one of
[1:57:34] the million testimony i have to share
[1:57:46] he knows our heart doesn't he
[1:57:51] i don't know if you guys are going
[1:57:54] through what i'm going through
[1:57:56] but there is a hunger in me
[1:57:59] for more of god than i have
[1:58:02] ever experienced and
[1:58:06] you know that you go back to
[1:58:09] the very simple things that brother
[1:58:12] branham said
[1:58:14] he said there's a deep calling to it
[1:58:17] deep
[1:58:19] but there can't be a deep calling to the
[1:58:21] deep
[1:58:22] unless there's a deep to respond to it
[1:58:26] and and the reason that we're there's
[1:58:29] this deep hunger for more of god
[1:58:32] like brother graham said i i i want to
[1:58:34] get to that
[1:58:35] deep like that place there's there's
[1:58:37] something more than this there's
[1:58:39] something
[1:58:40] there's something beyond this but the
[1:58:43] only reason that's in their calling
[1:58:46] is because there's something there to
[1:58:47] respond and
[1:58:49] what's there to respond has to respond
[1:58:54] you you understand if it
[1:58:58] he said like that boy ate the pedal from
[1:59:00] the because he needed sulfur
[1:59:02] but but there was sulfur there to
[1:59:04] respond
[1:59:06] and the reason we're feeling this great
[1:59:09] desire to
[1:59:10] move up into a higher place beyond
[1:59:15] and brother branham was not throwing any
[1:59:18] wet blanket in this tape he was
[1:59:22] he was pointing out to us there's
[1:59:25] that inner voice that's going to speak
[1:59:28] to every single one of their children
[1:59:32] his children so it becomes personal
[1:59:36] it's personally imparted
[1:59:39] from god to your heart
[1:59:43] and and i don't care what atmosphere it
[1:59:46] comes in
[1:59:48] you understand that's not the part that
[1:59:50] matters
[1:59:51] okay it doesn't matter about none of
[1:59:53] that what he said
[1:59:55] mattered was that god
[1:59:58] spoke to your heart and you know why
[2:00:01] that we feel a hunger in our heart
[2:00:03] because god wants to speak to your heart
[2:00:06] he wants you to know personally i've
[2:00:09] talked to him
[2:00:11] i've walked with him he spoke to me
[2:00:15] nobody can tell me he hasn't even when
[2:00:17] brother ben said when everything was
[2:00:19] going against him
[2:00:21] his wife was laying there died his
[2:00:23] baby's
[2:00:24] dying everything was there he said satan
[2:00:28] come up to you
[2:00:29] he said he couldn't tell me there was no
[2:00:31] god because i
[2:00:32] already heard him and i already seen him
[2:00:36] i knew there was god he tried to tell me
[2:00:38] he didn't love me
[2:00:40] he said that's when that deep
[2:00:43] deep on the inside cried out yet he
[2:00:46] slayed me
[2:00:47] though i'll serve him that's what we're
[2:00:49] talking about this morning
[2:00:51] those these are these testimonies sister
[2:00:53] that just
[2:00:54] set me on fire you know
[2:00:57] god's moving he's
[2:01:01] moving let's don't miss his move let's
[2:01:04] don't miss where the move is
[2:01:06] it's in the still
[2:01:09] small voice amen anybody else god's done
[2:01:14] something
[2:01:14] for him amen was it you barry that
[2:01:17] raised your hand brother gary god bless
[2:01:20] you
[2:01:41] try to keep it short but i just want to
[2:01:44] read a scripture
[2:01:45] from the book of romans chapter 8.
[2:02:10] just kind of been i've testified to
[2:02:13] several brothers
[2:02:15] recently just kind of what god's been
[2:02:18] doing in my life and
[2:02:21] but uh here in verse let's see
[2:02:28] verse 22 for we know that the whole
[2:02:32] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[2:02:34] together until now
[2:02:36] verse 23 and not only they but ourselves
[2:02:40] also which have the first fruits of the
[2:02:42] spirit even ourselves grown within
[2:02:45] ourselves waiting
[2:02:46] for the adoption to with the redemption
[2:02:48] of our body
[2:02:50] and so you know
[2:02:53] just i guess it's been about a year now
[2:02:58] about a year ago this time actually
[2:03:00] april 15th
[2:03:03] you know i guess it was even before then
[2:03:06] you know
[2:03:07] a lot of times we get to this we almost
[2:03:10] get to the end and can
[2:03:11] look back and then recognize what god
[2:03:13] has done
[2:03:15] in our lives but um so about
[2:03:19] i guess right around the time kova hit
[2:03:21] last march or so
[2:03:22] just a groaning in myself
[2:03:26] to come up higher and to be closer with
[2:03:28] him and
[2:03:30] you know and just the brotherhood in
[2:03:33] this church and
[2:03:34] the inspiration each one has been in my
[2:03:37] life is
[2:03:40] it's really hard to describe it's really
[2:03:43] hard to measure out
[2:03:45] in fact but um just knowing that
[2:03:50] he's always been there and then to turn
[2:03:53] around and see the manifestation of it
[2:03:58] so you know as covid kind of hits last
[2:04:01] march
[2:04:02] just groaning in myself to come up
[2:04:04] higher and
[2:04:06] you know i think brother matthew said
[2:04:08] something about praying
[2:04:10] and uttering things we don't even
[2:04:12] recognize but
[2:04:14] um seeing brothers that are
[2:04:17] you know just one thing that
[2:04:20] maybe brother jackson doesn't realize or
[2:04:23] never
[2:04:24] maybe i've never said it to him but you
[2:04:27] know he was the one that introduced me
[2:04:28] to this message
[2:04:29] and but um one thing that i feel like he
[2:04:33] instilled in me
[2:04:35] maybe more than anything else
[2:04:39] is availability just being available to
[2:04:43] be used
[2:04:44] being available to be worked on and to
[2:04:46] grow
[2:04:48] and so like i said last march when covet
[2:04:52] hit and groaning and
[2:04:53] wanting more of the lord and just not
[2:04:56] happy you know we know that
[2:04:57] natural types of spiritual and um
[2:05:01] not being happy in my work life and my
[2:05:03] job and just
[2:05:06] going through the monotony of working
[2:05:09] for 13 years for the same company in a
[2:05:11] warehouse and
[2:05:15] just wanting more and wanting something
[2:05:17] different so been in prayer about it
[2:05:19] and crying out and seeing god use
[2:05:22] brothers and
[2:05:23] and looking at their situation and where
[2:05:25] they're at with the lord
[2:05:27] and wanting those same things and
[2:05:30] so around april 15 i was let go at my
[2:05:34] job
[2:05:35] you know it was right after right in the
[2:05:38] middle of the pandemic
[2:05:40] and you know i come and i saw jackson
[2:05:45] and we talked in
[2:05:47] kosman's office at the time when he was
[2:05:48] working for cosmon and i was just
[2:05:52] i was relieved
[2:05:55] you know i couldn't explain
[2:05:59] how i felt other than i was relieved
[2:06:03] and um and yet excited
[2:06:07] and scared i had a family of five god
[2:06:10] had given me
[2:06:11] wonderful gifts of children and it was
[2:06:13] my greatest heart's desire to be a
[2:06:15] father and he gave me children and
[2:06:17] so here i am praying for
[2:06:21] something and a lot of times god will
[2:06:24] answer you in a way that's unexpected
[2:06:27] in a time that's really unexpected
[2:06:30] right in the middle pandemic i'll lose
[2:06:32] my job and
[2:06:34] so you know
[2:06:37] i just worked a lot with brother david
[2:06:38] over the summer and
[2:06:41] you know i really enjoyed myself because
[2:06:42] i was able to have fellowship with
[2:06:44] brothers and lunch with brothers and
[2:06:47] you know i was crying out to be a part
[2:06:49] of the morning studies at matthews and
[2:06:53] god made a way um
[2:06:58] and yet i was still groaning for more
[2:07:00] and more of him and
[2:07:02] um i guess it was about
[2:07:10] um
[2:07:12] of this year i guess brother aaron
[2:07:14] oglesby came over and preached and
[2:07:16] um talked about
[2:07:20] leading your children back to sodom
[2:07:23] and that was just such a turning point
[2:07:25] for me in my life
[2:07:26] you know i you know we get complacent
[2:07:30] we let things slip we let things
[2:07:33] enter in that we ought not to and
[2:07:36] whether
[2:07:36] you know whether it be simple things of
[2:07:40] keeping up with the news well that just
[2:07:42] fills your head full of junk i can
[2:07:44] testify to that but
[2:07:46] so as i've just purposed in my heart to
[2:07:50] let those things go
[2:07:53] what a piece came about in a and um
[2:07:57] and a daily a greater daily walk of
[2:08:00] reading my bible twice a day and
[2:08:02] being inspired by cause man and um
[2:08:08] brother joseph and even daniel hox and
[2:08:11] just seeing these brothers who god is
[2:08:14] doing the work in them
[2:08:15] and wanting the same thing in my life
[2:08:17] just knowing that
[2:08:18] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:08:20] forever
[2:08:22] if he'll do it for them he'll do it for
[2:08:23] for me and so
[2:08:27] um and it seems like you know aaron
[2:08:30] preached on a series
[2:08:31] a couple years ago about
[2:08:34] every time there's a work for god to do
[2:08:37] satan comes to war against it so every
[2:08:39] time there's a work in your life to do
[2:08:41] god
[2:08:41] you know satan wars against it so you
[2:08:44] know as i'm getting the victory
[2:08:47] of laying things down and and really
[2:08:49] entering in and having a greater walk
[2:08:51] with him
[2:08:51] then sam's like well i'll flip your body
[2:08:56] and so i just had been feeling a lot of
[2:08:58] discomfort on the left side in my
[2:09:00] stomach and even around my heart that
[2:09:02] just
[2:09:03] you know sometimes i think can be kind
[2:09:05] of a nervous person or
[2:09:08] you know i've listened to brother brown
[2:09:09] talk about those that are an overthinker
[2:09:11] or think things that they haven't
[2:09:13] crossed the bridge yet
[2:09:14] or um and so just
[2:09:17] filling those things in my body and not
[2:09:19] knowing you know
[2:09:20] and set up at a doctor's appointment and
[2:09:23] i called
[2:09:24] matthew had called me that day and we'd
[2:09:26] we'd prayed over the phone and
[2:09:29] um i get to the doctor and they wouldn't
[2:09:32] take our insurance
[2:09:33] so i just didn't go
[2:09:37] you know and so i would get back home
[2:09:39] and
[2:09:40] i even came up for a wednesday night
[2:09:42] service in prayer and matthew prayed for
[2:09:44] me again
[2:09:46] and you know as i walked away he talked
[2:09:48] about just
[2:09:49] taking in faith i think is some of the
[2:09:52] lines of what he said but
[2:09:54] you know like i said we know that the
[2:09:57] natural
[2:09:58] types of spiritual and so as i lost my
[2:10:02] job and
[2:10:04] now hadn't gotten a job in door-to-door
[2:10:07] knocking sales job
[2:10:10] and i was like is this where the lord
[2:10:12] wants me to be and i know that
[2:10:15] i had um tried for other warehouse
[2:10:18] positions and i just couldn't even get a
[2:10:20] um an interview with 13 years of
[2:10:24] experience
[2:10:25] so i'm like lord is this where you want
[2:10:26] me to be and i know that we
[2:10:29] i mean we have to have faith for a
[2:10:31] rapture to take a rapture
[2:10:34] so i was just stepping out on faith and
[2:10:38] wanting to live by faith he wants to you
[2:10:40] know he
[2:10:41] he wants us to be his everything
[2:10:45] everything you know and so
[2:10:48] as i'm knocking these doors it's almost
[2:10:54] like
[2:10:58] in a daily transition
[2:11:03] it's an uncomfortability there it's a
[2:11:07] learning how to get yourself out of the
[2:11:09] way and trust in the process
[2:11:12] and i could just look in my life in the
[2:11:16] natural and see it in the spiritual that
[2:11:18] he's wanting to do the same things to
[2:11:19] get
[2:11:20] ourselves completely out of the way that
[2:11:22] we could be used by him
[2:11:25] and so you know as these brothers
[2:11:29] have just testified and and god's been
[2:11:31] doing a work
[2:11:32] i just believe you know our lives are
[2:11:38] as a christian we're a continual
[2:11:40] testimony
[2:11:42] and so just believe that he's still
[2:11:45] working
[2:11:46] you know and i just wanted to testify
[2:11:48] that like brother david said
[2:11:50] god still moves he's still doing the
[2:11:51] work he
[2:11:53] he's in his bride he's in his people
[2:11:55] he's moving in the brothers the love
[2:11:59] you know as he even said um has even
[2:12:02] titled you know faith is contagious i
[2:12:06] mean we're
[2:12:06] are we not seeing the manifestation of
[2:12:08] that but
[2:12:09] i just wanted to testify of how god had
[2:12:12] you know naturally
[2:12:14] been doing spiritually things in me with
[2:12:16] losing my job and
[2:12:18] in the middle of a pandemic and even can
[2:12:21] testify
[2:12:22] that we were you know i lost my job in
[2:12:26] april
[2:12:29] and somehow someway god gave us a house
[2:12:33] in november
[2:12:35] knowing that i lost my job in april
[2:12:39] with a deadline of november coming that
[2:12:42] we can no longer stay in our apartment
[2:12:45] wanting
[2:12:46] to own or not well to own a home but
[2:12:50] to have a home period
[2:12:54] and to see it manifested you know we
[2:12:57] you know we joke a lot but i made a
[2:12:59] little
[2:13:00] group for the guys that were moving me
[2:13:02] moving
[2:13:03] my apartment and called it you know
[2:13:05] manifested promise movers
[2:13:08] because the promise had come to pass
[2:13:12] you know we needed a home and in the
[2:13:15] middle of not having a job
[2:13:17] a pandemic god had made a way
[2:13:20] so i just wanted to testify that
[2:13:33] manifested promise movers
[2:13:37] that's okay i like that
[2:13:40] anybody else wanted the lord
[2:13:44] now brother go ahead
[2:13:55] this year we had probably 40 young
[2:13:58] people that wanted to go to louisiana
[2:14:01] and we it was very unique in that half
[2:14:03] of them were divided kind of doing
[2:14:05] um grouping up in little categories and
[2:14:08] going out
[2:14:09] uh with the group and then we had some
[2:14:12] um some of the younger ones going to
[2:14:15] uh van loads brother chris and myself
[2:14:17] drove the vans
[2:14:18] and i would have to say that this year
[2:14:21] was unique in that
[2:14:23] about 75 of the people that went
[2:14:26] actually never been before so it was
[2:14:29] very unique in that way
[2:14:30] and so the expectation already was just
[2:14:34] like a raw expectation
[2:14:36] and a hunger for god to see god move for
[2:14:39] them and it became
[2:14:41] such a neat thing to see it unfold it
[2:14:44] set an expectation in my heart to see
[2:14:46] how god's going to move and change lives
[2:14:48] and and just to see a real personal
[2:14:51] connection made with god for each of
[2:14:53] these individuals
[2:14:54] and so as we started out on our journey
[2:14:58] it was so neat how the lord was dealing
[2:15:00] with them and it seemed like walls were
[2:15:02] being broken down and there was
[2:15:04] like a unity starting to to over
[2:15:07] take like the fellowship and it was just
[2:15:10] really wonderful to see that
[2:15:11] and um i i testified to
[2:15:15] some brothers we had a little thursday
[2:15:18] get together
[2:15:19] and something that popped out that
[2:15:21] brother branham had said
[2:15:22] um in the easter seal but you know
[2:15:25] sometimes brother branham he's just
[2:15:26] talking he's not necessarily preaching
[2:15:28] on the word but he just
[2:15:29] in conversation would say something and
[2:15:32] he said something that was so marvelous
[2:15:34] to me
[2:15:34] that uh he was doing a hunting trip and
[2:15:37] there was a young man
[2:15:38] that brother brandon had noticed
[2:15:40] something on his era bro
[2:15:41] and he said donald then he asked him the
[2:15:43] question he said now
[2:15:45] he didn't bro this brother donovan never
[2:15:47] mentioned for brother branham to pray
[2:15:49] for him or nothing
[2:15:50] right but he's just fellowshipping with
[2:15:52] brother branham doing a hunting trip
[2:15:54] and well brother branham just asked him
[2:15:56] the question about this growth on is he
[2:15:58] here
[2:15:59] and it's so it was so
[2:16:03] outstanding to me that brother brown's
[2:16:05] response he said he didn't even pray he
[2:16:07] just looked over and he said my brother
[2:16:10] brother branham looked at donovan in
[2:16:12] such a way
[2:16:13] in his heart he had a love and you know
[2:16:16] it was something because
[2:16:18] that sermon that brother brandon
[2:16:19] preached he said when when divine love
[2:16:22] is projected
[2:16:23] sovereign grace and i began to say oh my
[2:16:27] what a theme and in my heart i want to
[2:16:29] see this kind of love
[2:16:30] in my life and so as we're driving out
[2:16:33] there
[2:16:34] i see god's dealing with people and the
[2:16:37] supernatural is present and people are
[2:16:39] being changed
[2:16:40] and then i see a man who you know some
[2:16:43] of y'all
[2:16:45] may not have heard but uh brother ron
[2:16:47] spencer
[2:16:48] he's been through the fire he's been
[2:16:50] through cancer
[2:16:51] and this man standing here and and then
[2:16:54] even brother tim
[2:16:55] testifies of how that or brother ron he
[2:16:58] was in that dark and and there was a
[2:17:00] love of god in brother tim's heart that
[2:17:02] he went
[2:17:03] out there and he spent time with him and
[2:17:06] so
[2:17:06] so brother ron testified how that
[2:17:10] he knew he wasn't alone you know there's
[2:17:13] things that you and i
[2:17:14] we go through and each one of us can
[2:17:16] affect each other like eggs
[2:17:18] and the love that you have it made such
[2:17:21] an
[2:17:22] impact and to see i i saw them rejoicing
[2:17:26] so much so that like it reminds me of
[2:17:28] the scripture in galatians five it says
[2:17:31] now now the this this faith
[2:17:34] there's a faith that we're looking for
[2:17:36] that worketh by love
[2:17:39] and and i began to see a theme unfolding
[2:17:42] in the man of god as he was delivering
[2:17:44] his burden
[2:17:45] and then to see brother tim and brother
[2:17:48] ron
[2:17:49] hugging and this was not just a
[2:17:51] brotherly love there was something
[2:17:52] more someone showed that a
[2:17:56] he said while i'm preaching these tumors
[2:17:58] are going to be dissolved
[2:18:00] oh i thought what a love what what a
[2:18:03] faith that someone could proclaim the
[2:18:05] word
[2:18:06] and and so oh my
[2:18:12] because now i begin to see okay that's
[2:18:15] the word
[2:18:16] that that what i heard about brother
[2:18:18] donovan
[2:18:19] i rejoiced him and i i i see the love of
[2:18:23] god
[2:18:24] being manifested with brother tim and
[2:18:25] brother ron
[2:18:27] and then all of a sudden you know
[2:18:29] expectation is like gasoline
[2:18:32] you got gasoline all over everybody yeah
[2:18:34] i was in need of that spark
[2:18:36] that's right all of a sudden i see my
[2:18:38] sister julia
[2:18:39] she's walking down the aisle and she
[2:18:42] goes right to the front
[2:18:44] and all of a sudden something's
[2:18:46] happening in me
[2:18:47] i said that's my sister boom she got the
[2:18:50] victory and it was like oh
[2:18:52] man an explosion happened all right
[2:18:55] glory to god i just want to thank god
[2:18:57] because
[2:18:57] he's alive he's well he's resurrected we
[2:19:00] have so much to be thankful for
[2:19:02] and just the expectation of what god has
[2:19:04] doing
[2:19:05] just whatever is in your heart go for it
[2:19:08] [Applause]
[2:19:17] and then isn't that what love does it
[2:19:20] takes you
[2:19:20] from you instead of being used for you
[2:19:24] and it's used for somebody else that's
[2:19:26] way brother i think you started to come
[2:19:28] to
[2:19:28] come on go ahead
[2:19:44] god bless double c church um
[2:19:47] so two three weeks ago uh something
[2:19:50] happened that
[2:19:51] took me back to the testimony or the
[2:19:54] things that god has done for me
[2:19:56] uh and um i was marveled because
[2:19:59] it felt like a dream one more time you
[2:20:02] know but it wasn't a dream
[2:20:04] and i've been growing up i've been
[2:20:06] having this struggle and the struggle is
[2:20:08] i'm very impatient uh this is something
[2:20:11] i pray to god every single day that i
[2:20:13] was part of my christian journey i just
[2:20:15] believe you know once that torch comes
[2:20:17] in it would take care of that
[2:20:19] and um i just grow up if i want
[2:20:22] something done i just want it done
[2:20:25] and the inpatient just keeps growing it
[2:20:27] just keeps growing
[2:20:29] and it also happened you know even in my
[2:20:32] christian life
[2:20:33] um i would find that just as you know
[2:20:36] the quote or the salmon we were
[2:20:38] listening to
[2:20:39] you know listening to that still small
[2:20:41] voice
[2:20:42] it does really speaks because i do hear
[2:20:45] it but most of the time
[2:20:46] it's probably because i'm not paying
[2:20:48] attention to it
[2:20:49] or i'm pretty much just occupied with
[2:20:52] something else
[2:20:54] and so during the time you know the
[2:20:56] testimony almost
[2:20:57] looks like the same during the time that
[2:20:59] i was looking for a job
[2:21:00] you know um it was a big problem yeah i
[2:21:03] was like oh
[2:21:04] why this time what happened and um
[2:21:07] i can remember i had an interview that
[2:21:10] was coming up it was for a position a
[2:21:12] director position i was so happy
[2:21:14] oh they reached out to me i never
[2:21:16] reached out to them so
[2:21:17] in my mind i was like oh this is a done
[2:21:19] deal god answered my prayer and this
[2:21:22] and all of a sudden the morning of that
[2:21:24] interview um i woke up
[2:21:26] it was a home and before then i've been
[2:21:29] having that struggle i just want you to
[2:21:31] be patient
[2:21:32] and that's what the spirit keeps telling
[2:21:35] me you have to be patient

[2:22:38] the first thing i told my wife is i
[2:22:40] don't want to be slow
[2:22:42] like why are you knocking on my door
[2:22:44] this morning
[2:22:46] um well i sat for the interview it all
[2:22:49] went well
[2:22:50] it never came it never worked out i sat
[2:22:53] for a couple interviews
[2:22:55] after that it never walked out two weeks
[2:22:57] ago i was sitting down
[2:22:58] in my office and then i had a meeting
[2:23:02] with
[2:23:02] with my boss and in the conference room
[2:23:05] something happened to the conference
[2:23:07] uh the the the conference technology
[2:23:11] and i was setting it up and i just
[2:23:14] remembered it was just like you know
[2:23:16] they would say oh it just came back and
[2:23:18] i've been shown
[2:23:19] exactly what i was doing in that room
[2:23:22] who actually sat
[2:23:23] on that room the people that were
[2:23:25] sitting across from me
[2:23:26] and i just remember i just dropped my
[2:23:28] hand and my boss was like are you okay
[2:23:31] i was like i've seen this i've seen this
[2:23:34] and
[2:23:35] you know he was looking at me like okay
[2:23:36] you acting up again
[2:23:38] but but i actually know what i saw and
[2:23:41] so i was just like
[2:23:42] oh my god i came home i told my wife
[2:23:45] i told everybody i was like can you
[2:23:47] believe this like
[2:23:49] this is what happened i've seen that but
[2:23:51] i was never patient for it
[2:23:53] um but then when i finally became
[2:23:57] you know a little more patient i sat and
[2:23:59] waited for god to give me this job
[2:24:01] um everything just fell in place um
[2:24:04] i'm in a place where i would say i have
[2:24:07] the best time of my life i don't
[2:24:10] i don't get worried in fact my wife is
[2:24:13] my boss because
[2:24:14] she's the one that tells me to go to
[2:24:15] work and
[2:24:17] and so i i'm just in a place where i
[2:24:20] just felt like god was trying to tell me
[2:24:22] something you
[2:24:23] have to be patient listen to me and when
[2:24:26] i heard
[2:24:26] that sermon you know when i heard
[2:24:28] brother brown talking i just said
[2:24:30] oh i need more of him i just want to
[2:24:33] listen to that in
[2:24:34] every aspect of my life and i'm just
[2:24:37] using this opportunity also say pray for
[2:24:39] me
[2:24:40] i just need to get i want to listen to
[2:24:42] that small
[2:24:43] still voice
[2:25:07] i bless you all amen
[2:25:10] um a lot of you know me some of you may
[2:25:13] not i don't know but
[2:25:15] uh i grew up
[2:25:18] around the message i say not
[2:25:20] necessarily in it
[2:25:23] excuse me if i get emotional god's done
[2:25:24] a lot for me lately
[2:25:29] but anyway i don't want to beat up on a
[2:25:30] piano let me slide this over here
[2:25:33] god forgive me anyhow um
[2:25:40] i went to church for years when i was a
[2:25:43] pew warmer is what i was
[2:25:47] um i wasn't serious
[2:25:52] then i caught myself you know coming to
[2:25:55] church for the wrong reason to impress
[2:25:57] people
[2:25:58] that's no reason to come to church
[2:26:03] so i told my wife i said you know what
[2:26:06] i'm not going to go anymore
[2:26:08] i'm not going to go until i can go for
[2:26:09] god
[2:26:12] and my wife got sick and i said well
[2:26:13] here's a perfect opportunity to quit
[2:26:15] going to church i could stay home take
[2:26:16] care of her
[2:26:17] you know do the things around the house
[2:26:18] need to take care of so i did
[2:26:21] and i guess i was gone for about a year
[2:26:25] and uh i was growing colder and darker
[2:26:28] in my heart
[2:26:30] so much that we went to land passes and
[2:26:33] uh was down there
[2:26:35] and um long story short i had a stroke
[2:26:38] 44 years old i ain't supposed to have no
[2:26:40] stroke
[2:26:41] but uh i had a stroke on my right side
[2:26:43] of my my body i mean so much i was
[2:26:44] picking up a dog a bag food i mean a bag
[2:26:46] of dog food
[2:26:47] and it just went right through and i
[2:26:49] couldn't couldn't grab it nothing with
[2:26:50] his hand and it was just weird very
[2:26:52] weird never experienced anything like
[2:26:53] this
[2:26:55] so when my wife took him to the hospital
[2:26:57] there in land passes
[2:27:00] and it got so bad i mean and i was so
[2:27:03] frustrated trying to talk to the nurse
[2:27:05] because i couldn't get no words out
[2:27:07] so they put me in an ambulance and sent
[2:27:08] me down to uh austin
[2:27:11] while i was there they run a bunch of
[2:27:12] tests on me come to find out i got a
[2:27:14] hole in my heart that i was born
[2:27:16] with well uh when the doctor came and
[2:27:19] told me this i'll tell you what that
[2:27:21] hole's all about i said that's where
[2:27:22] jesus christ belongs
[2:27:24] but he hadn't been there for a while
[2:27:27] so and uh
[2:27:30] i said when he comes back in it'll be
[2:27:32] fine
[2:27:34] but uh anyhow
[2:27:38] so come to find out i got a hole in my
[2:27:39] heart got
[2:27:41] been having many strokes or whatever um
[2:27:43] got a blown acl man i'm just falling
[2:27:45] apart you know
[2:27:47] but uh still wasn't going to say well
[2:27:49] you know what i'm still not going to use
[2:27:50] that as to go to church because i want
[2:27:52] to go for god
[2:27:53] i'm not going to go for his mercy i want
[2:27:56] to go
[2:27:57] to please him so anyway long story short

[2:28:01] i was talking to her one day she called
[2:28:02] me on the phone and she was telling me
[2:28:05] she was having some rough times and i
[2:28:06] told her i said casey i said
[2:28:09] when was the last time you prayed when
[2:28:12] was the last time you read your bible

[2:28:27] you preach that again
[2:28:30] god my god the tears just i just wept
[2:28:33] god forgive me i said
[2:28:36] so that wednesday i started coming back
[2:28:38] to church
[2:28:39] and he's just been working on me day and
[2:28:41] night
[2:28:43] day and night more and more every day i
[2:28:46] wake up i love him more
[2:28:49] and i told some brothers i said i
[2:28:51] challenged him the other day
[2:28:53] challenge jesus what do you mean i said
[2:28:54] well i did i said prophet said you can
[2:28:56] never outlove the lord well
[2:28:58] i'm trying i want to try and out love
[2:29:00] him but i know the more i love him the
[2:29:02] more he's gonna love me amen
[2:29:04] but uh i'll tell you another
[2:29:08] thing i may be the last person in this
[2:29:11] building that had a television in their
[2:29:12] home i don't know but i ain't got no one
[2:29:14] no more
[2:29:15] by the grace of god brother matthew came
[2:29:18] over one night and helped me get him out
[2:29:19] he says i had his big 65-inch monster
[2:29:22] above my fireplace and i
[2:29:24] with my my knee i wasn't about to climb
[2:29:26] up there and pull that thing down so
[2:29:27] he'd come over and help me get it down
[2:29:30] got it out of the house and uh the very
[2:29:32] next day
[2:29:33] very next morning god gave me this
[2:29:36] scripture he told me to read
[2:29:37] ecclesiastics
[2:29:39] and this is what he said excuse me i'm
[2:29:44] over 40. i need my eyes out here hold on
[2:29:51] ecclesiastes 9 7
[2:29:54] 7 8 9 reads like this it says go thy way
[2:29:57] eat thy bread with joy
[2:29:59] drink thy wine with a merry heart for
[2:30:01] god now accepteth thy works
[2:30:04] let thy garments always be white let thy
[2:30:07] head lack no ointment
[2:30:09] live joyfully with the wife whom thou
[2:30:11] lovest all the days of thy life of
[2:30:13] vanity
[2:30:14] which he hath given thee unto the son
[2:30:16] all the days of thy vanity
[2:30:18] for that is thy portion in this life and
[2:30:21] in thy labor which thou takest unto the
[2:30:23] sun
[2:30:25] i'm telling you folks it's time to get
[2:30:28] serious
[2:30:29] because god is on the move
[2:30:32] and uh like i said i just love him more
[2:30:35] and more
[2:30:36] i don't want to take up too much time
[2:30:38] it's hard getting late so
[2:30:40] god bless you all i love each and every
[2:30:41] one of you
[2:30:52] man well it's almost 9 30 so i think we
[2:30:56] just ought to do this again sometime
[2:30:59] amen
[2:31:00] i really think there's a hunger for god
[2:31:03] in our heart
[2:31:04] and and god is moving and
[2:31:08] i think we heard tonight where you find
[2:31:10] them
[2:31:11] and he's moving because he wants to get
[2:31:14] a hold of this
[2:31:17] so he can move in you and you can do
[2:31:21] that
[2:31:21] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[2:31:24] you can ask
[2:31:25] or think and pretty soon not only is god
[2:31:29] moving on you not only is he moving
[2:31:32] in you but now he's using you
[2:31:36] to move on other people and that's one
[2:31:39] of the greatest things that can
[2:31:41] ever happen in your life so i think the
[2:31:44] lord just kind of
[2:31:46] spoken to us tonight and i think that
[2:31:48] the more we look in
[2:31:51] the more we'll be able to look out and
[2:31:53] the more he
[2:31:54] speaks to us on the inside the more
[2:31:57] he'll be moving
[2:31:59] on the outside amen he loves you
[2:32:02] he wants to do exceedingly and
[2:32:05] abundantly
[2:32:06] above what you can ask or think and he
[2:32:09] really
[2:32:10] wants to be manifested in your
[2:32:13] your mortal flesh that people can look
[2:32:16] at you
[2:32:17] and they can see god on the inside
[2:32:20] not anything it goes beyond
[2:32:24] temporary it becomes supernatural
[2:32:27] as we become closer and closer and more
[2:32:31] one with god i believe we'll see his
[2:32:34] hand
[2:32:35] moving and it will our love
[2:32:38] is going to call him down to manifest
[2:32:41] himself
[2:32:43] on one another and i think we're fixing
[2:32:45] to see some
[2:32:46] miracles and some things that are beyond
[2:32:50] anything that we ever
[2:32:53] dream of he's still a discerner of the
[2:32:56] thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:32:58] and he still can do for us exceedingly
[2:33:01] and abundantly
[2:33:02] what he could ask or think so brother
[2:33:04] billy if you could come
[2:33:06] and lead us in a little bit of worship
[2:33:11] anyway before we sing maybe we could
[2:33:14] just say anybody have a prayer request
[2:33:17] on their heart or his mind that they
[2:33:19] want god to do
[2:33:20] something for him just raise them up to
[2:33:22] him we'll we'll hold those
[2:33:24] right before the lord and
[2:33:28] ask god so let's stand together
[2:33:36] and let us pray together before brother
[2:33:39] billy leads us in some
[2:33:40] worship and turns our hearts to the lord
[2:33:42] our gracious heavenly father
