[11:32] amen God bless you welcome everyone in
[11:35] the house of God this morning are you
[11:37] happy to be gathered here this morning
[11:39] and certainly we'll invite you to stand
[11:41] as you invite by Mike for our Psalm
[11:43] reading this morning amen let's just bow
[11:46] our
[11:47] heads gracious father we're so thankful
[11:49] to be gathered in your presence Lord
[11:52] there's your children there's nothing
[11:53] more we enjoy than to be gathering the
[11:55] Assembly of Believers Lord to come and
[11:57] hear the word of God and so so therefore
[11:59] when to commit the service from the
[12:01] beginning to the ending into your hands
[12:03] father ask that you may come and take
[12:05] control over everything that will be
[12:06] done Lord let it be pleasing before your
[12:09] sight but above all Lord that the word
[12:11] may come in it may change our hearts
[12:13] Lord that it may impart to us the the
[12:16] part of you that we need Lord in order
[12:18] for us to overcome this world Lord we
[12:21] have nothing without you lord we realize
[12:23] that father your word is our daily bread
[12:27] is the thing on which we depend on your
[12:29] word is our access into the supernatural
[12:32] Lord and we ask that you give it to us
[12:34] for the measure that you have in store
[12:36] for us today so therefore we invite you
[12:38] and ask those things in the name of the
[12:40] Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may
[12:43] turn around and welcome someone amen God
[12:46] bless
[12:57] you good morning
[13:00] may be seated for a
[13:03] minute a couple weeks ago when we were
[13:05] reading the
[13:06] psalm you know we spoke
[13:09] of we spoke of those whose
[13:13] eyes wait on the Lord just as a
[13:17] servant would watch their
[13:20] Master you know and describing how there
[13:23] was such a closeness
[13:25] there that a real trusted servant
[13:29] could had such a familiarity with the
[13:33] master that he or she could see him just
[13:36] begin to move in a certain way and they
[13:39] would know what the master wants done
[13:43] and they would move to complete the
[13:45] work
[13:47] knowing what he wants
[13:50] done we're going to turn to Psalm 130
[13:53] this morning and is just kind of
[13:55] continuing on that thought there's so
[13:58] much in that little Psalm it's speaks
[14:01] much of redemption and of forgiveness
[14:03] and of Mercy but you know continuing on
[14:07] that
[14:09] thought what are we looking
[14:11] for how are we looking and if you
[14:15] remember it kind of was a thought that
[14:17] came from what a statement that brother
[14:19] Brandon made and Look Away to
[14:22] Jesus he said but here's the thing I
[14:26] want to ask you tonight for these next
[14:27] few minutes
[14:30] when you
[14:31] look the question is what do you see
[14:34] when you
[14:36] look what do you see when you
[14:39] look that only
[14:41] depends on what you're looking
[14:45] for you know and we often Look to
[14:49] Him we set our eyes on him for our
[14:53] need our
[14:55] desire our burden
[14:59] what's important to
[15:02] us you know and it's not necessarily bad
[15:05] because he's our need meter he promised
[15:08] that he would meet our need he promised
[15:10] he would deliver us he promised he would
[15:14] heal
[15:16] us but you
[15:18] know there are often our
[15:22] desires you know as brother David's been
[15:25] sharing with us and we've been hearing
[15:26] through messages like leadership
[15:29] you know there's a
[15:31] point in our
[15:34] walk
[15:36] when we're looking to him
[15:38] shifts from what our desire is to what
[15:43] his desire
[15:46] is you know as we read last week as the
[15:50] eyes of servants look unto the hand of
[15:53] their
[15:53] masters so our eyes wait upon the Lord
[15:57] Our God Amen
[16:00] you know and are we looking to him to be
[16:02] the provider of our need the meter of
[16:04] our desire sure
[16:07] absolutely but are we getting to a place
[16:10] where we're looking to him for his
[16:12] desire for what he wants
[16:16] done with all preconceived notions with
[16:20] all assumptions and intellectual beliefs
[16:24] and preferences set aside
[16:29] to see what he wants
[16:32] done you know Psalm
[16:34] 130:5 and 6 makes this statement says I
[16:38] wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and
[16:43] in his word do I hope my soul waiteth
[16:46] for the Lord more than they that watch
[16:50] for the
[16:51] morning I say more than they that watch
[16:55] for the
[16:57] morning now we've been taught to wait on
[16:59] the
[17:01] Lord wait on the Lord be of good courage
[17:05] and he will strengthen your
[17:08] heart but if you're anything like me I
[17:11] often will limit that scripture
[17:13] to you know a word of encouragement in
[17:16] my hour of need wait on the Lord and
[17:19] he'll strengthen your
[17:22] heart something I have laid before him
[17:25] in
[17:27] prayer the promise is still true but
[17:31] there's more here for us to lay hold
[17:35] of there's another level of
[17:38] waiting you know if you remember the
[17:41] many tapes we've listened to brother
[17:42] brandom's how many times did he start
[17:45] talking and then he would say you know
[17:47] who I'm waiting
[17:49] for you know and the question is is was
[17:52] he waiting for an answer to his desire
[17:56] or to his need or to his request
[18:00] or was he waiting to see what the Lord
[18:04] wanted
[18:08] done you know Jesus said it this way in
[18:10] John
[18:13] 59 verily verily I say unto you the
[18:19] son can do nothing of
[18:23] himself but what he seeth the father do
[18:27] for what soever things he doeth these
[18:31] also doeth the son
[18:34] likewise I can do nothing on my own but
[18:37] instead I'm
[18:39] watching waiting to see what he wants
[18:43] done you know it was kind of that
[18:46] thought that's been on my mind you know
[18:48] later he turned to his
[18:50] disciples in John 15 he said I am the
[18:54] vine ye are the branches he that abideth
[18:57] in me and and I in him the same bringeth
[19:01] forth much fruit and then he says this
[19:03] for without me ye can do
[19:07] nothing instead
[19:10] watching waiting to see what he wants
[19:14] done know not going off and doing our
[19:18] thing until we hear something from him
[19:21] you know or so busy with our thing that
[19:24] sometimes we have to be slapped in the
[19:25] face to hear what the Lord wants done
[19:27] but
[19:30] ready watching to see what he might have
[19:34] us do
[19:37] leadership verse six my soul waiteth for
[19:40] the Lord more than they that watch for
[19:42] the
[19:43] morning you know the fact is we live in
[19:45] this age of electricity that has enabled
[19:47] us to pretty much do anything 24 hours a
[19:50] day but you know it used to be that when
[19:54] the sun went down you had to stop
[19:57] everything you you couldn't see you
[19:59] didn't know where to go or what to work
[20:02] on because you couldn't see what needed
[20:03] to be done you couldn't see what
[20:06] direction to go couldn't see where you
[20:08] were and so you waited and you paused
[20:12] and you did nothing until the sun came
[20:15] back out and you could see what needed
[20:16] to be done you could see what direction
[20:19] to go you could see where you needed to
[20:22] turn but until then you held
[20:26] still doing nothing
[20:29] until you can
[20:32] see my
[20:34] soul Waits on the
[20:37] Lord even more than they that watch for
[20:44] mourning just as much as someone would
[20:48] wait to see so they knew what could be
[20:50] worked on so that they knew where they
[20:52] could go being in a place where we hold
[20:56] still cuz we don't know what to do we
[21:00] don't know what he wants done he doesn't
[21:02] know we don't know where we he wants us
[21:04] to go until we wait to see or hear from
[21:08] him you know we're very every day I
[21:11] would say we're very busy
[21:13] people we live in a very busy
[21:16] age you know we're all involved in a lot
[21:19] of
[21:20] activity but I want I often have to ask
[21:24] myself am I waiting to see what he wants
[21:27] to
[21:29] rather than just assuming what's in
[21:30] front of me is his
[21:33] leadership what happened to I do nothing
[21:38] until Jesus said in Matthew
[21:41] 6:33 seek ye
[21:44] first the kingdom of
[21:46] God before we do anything we seek the
[21:49] desire of the
[21:51] king and his
[21:54] righteousness what he wants
[21:57] done and all these other
[22:00] things will be added unto you be taken
[22:02] care
[22:05] of interestingly enough just before that
[22:07] in verse
[22:09] 22 Jesus is speaking about
[22:12] eyesight where you're
[22:15] looking he says the light of the body is
[22:18] the eye if therefore thine eye be
[22:23] single thy whole body shall be full of
[22:26] light you know that word single means
[22:28] clear it means focused free of
[22:31] distraction or
[22:34] obstruction but then he says but if
[22:36] thine eye be evil thy whole body shall
[22:40] be full of Darkness do you know that
[22:42] word evil there is actually translated
[22:45] everywhere else in the Bible is the word
[22:47] man 68
[22:49] times it actually means full of Labor
[22:54] annoyances and
[22:56] hardships so if our
[23:00] eyesight is so full of the activity and
[23:04] the
[23:05] distractions and the pressures and the
[23:08] demands and the activities and the cares
[23:12] and the questions and the burdens of
[23:16] mankind if that is filling our
[23:20] vision we can't see clear enough to see
[23:22] his
[23:23] leadership because there's so many other
[23:25] things going
[23:26] on
[23:29] but what work does he want done what
[23:32] does he want us to be
[23:34] about the importance of what we're
[23:37] looking
[23:39] for as brother brandham said what are
[23:41] you seeing when you look how are you
[23:47] looking you know and my prayer is that
[23:49] I'm focused so clearly on
[23:53] him that I don't miss his leadership
[23:56] when he starts to move
[24:00] and that I'm careful to seek his
[24:02] leadership before I
[24:04] move let's go ahead and stand this
[24:08] morning you know I'm grateful for his
[24:11] Mercy for all the times I don't do that
[24:15] he says in verse three if thou oh Lord
[24:17] shouldst mark my
[24:19] iniquities who shall stand right you
[24:24] know and iniquity as we know is doing
[24:26] our own thing
[24:28] even when we know
[24:32] better everyone doing what seems right
[24:35] in their own eyes we hear from the world
[24:38] all the time you do you you be
[24:41] you but what if we were
[24:44] him what if we did
[24:47] him you know if we could get our eyes
[24:49] off our thing long enough to see what
[24:54] thing he wants us to do you know that's
[24:57] my prayer we go ahead and read Psalm 13
[24:59] this morning it's just a short Psalm
[25:02] starting in verse one out of the depths
[25:04] have I Cried unto thee Oh Lord Lord hear
[25:07] my voice let thine ears be attentive to
[25:10] the voice of my supplications if thou
[25:13] Lord should marked iniquities oh Lord
[25:15] who shall stand but there is forgiveness
[25:18] with thee that thou mayest be feared I
[25:21] wait for the Lord my soul do wait and in
[25:24] his word do I hope my soul waiteth for
[25:27] the Lord more than they that watch for
[25:29] the morning I say more than they that
[25:31] watch for the morning let Israel hope in
[25:34] the Lord for with the Lord there is
[25:36] Mercy and with him is plenteous
[25:38] redemption and he shall redeem Israel
[25:41] from all his iniquities
[25:45] amen amen God bless you may have your
[25:50] seats man let's sing at Calvary

[36:57] God bless
[37:00] you I um my voice was gone this morning
[37:03] and but I really wanted to sing this
[37:05] song and it's called his strength is
[37:07] perfect when my strength is gone so I
[37:09] like well that's appropriate so I hope
[37:11] it's a blessing to
[37:25] you I do all
[37:28] [Music]
[37:29] things through Christ who gives me
[37:34] strength but sometimes I wonder what he
[37:39] can do through
[37:45] me no great success to
[37:50] show no glory of my
[37:54] own yet in my weakness he is there to
[38:00] let me
[38:04] know his strength is
[38:08] perfect when my strength is
[38:14] God he'll carry
[38:18] us when we
[38:20] can carry
[38:25] on raised in his
[38:29] power the weak become
[38:35] strong his strength is
[38:40] perfect his strength is
[38:44] [Music]
[38:55] perfect oh
[38:57] oh we can only
[39:01] know all the power that he
[39:06] holds when we truly see how deep a
[39:12] weakness
[39:16] goes all his strength in US
[39:21] begins when now comes to an end
[39:27] for he hears a humble cry and
[39:32] proves
[39:35] again his strength is
[39:39] perfect when our strength is
[39:45] God he carry us when we
[39:51] can't carry
[39:55] on
[39:57] raised in his
[39:59] power the weak become

[43:41] Jesus we don't see what goes on in the
[43:44] spiritual realm we don't see what goes
[43:46] on that's Waring against us father but
[43:49] all we know is that each day when we

[43:52] grace Lord
[43:54] Jesus and here we are gathered than your

[45:17] strength that we could have no ritual we
[45:20] could partake in to make these things

[1:00:18] seated this
[1:00:22] morning I just have to uh
[1:00:25] I was walking through the uh our a new
[1:00:28] Fellowship uh building and uh the
[1:00:32] painter was painting and just as I made
[1:00:35] a step he pulled on his hose and he
[1:00:38] tripped me and uh I kind of went
[1:00:42] straight down on both my knees and uh
[1:00:46] lesie said we got to take you to the
[1:00:48] hospital and and get you x-rayed and I
[1:00:51] said yeah he's just going to tell me
[1:00:52] that I just busted up my knees and I
[1:00:56] know that cuz I can feel it but anyway I
[1:01:00] didn't know if I could make the steps
[1:01:02] this morning or if I could stand up uh
[1:01:04] speaking very long so uh Matthew is
[1:01:07] going to uh take our service this
[1:01:10] morning but you know it really doesn't
[1:01:12] matter who's speaking when the source is
[1:01:15] the word of God for the hour amen and I
[1:01:19] I think today's Lindsay's birthday isn't
[1:01:21] that is Lindsay you're 21 today I
[1:01:23] believe it is
[1:01:25] and uh well if you look 21 then you can
[1:01:27] say you're 21 right you know I tried to
[1:01:30] say I was 60 and someone looked at me
[1:01:32] like I was crazy so anyway but we're
[1:01:35] we're grateful for that in each one you
[1:01:38] know we have some special needs and I I
[1:01:41] wanted to make them known you know uh
[1:01:44] brother Sergio and sister Dalia Morales
[1:01:48] they drive all the way from uh Tyler
[1:01:51] Texas to be in service with us and
[1:01:55] in the next few weeks they're uh they've
[1:01:58] got some real uh challenging uh events
[1:02:02] uh that will shape uh the future of
[1:02:06] their lives and uh we want to really
[1:02:09] keep them in prayer and H that they
[1:02:12] might know that we love them that we're
[1:02:14] thinking of them and that our God's the
[1:02:17] Victorious God and the scripture simply
[1:02:20] says if you seek first the kingdom of
[1:02:23] God all else will be added unto you you
[1:02:26] you never can never can fail putting God
[1:02:30] first and you can't put God first
[1:02:34] without putting his word first because
[1:02:38] him and his word are one and the Lord
[1:02:41] Jesus was that word manifested in flesh
[1:02:47] not a different flesh the same flesh
[1:02:49] that we've got tempted the same way we
[1:02:53] were tempted yet there was no sin found
[1:02:57] in him he suffered the same way we
[1:03:01] suffer in fact all of our burdens he
[1:03:06] carried that we might have hope that we
[1:03:09] can become like him and isn't that our
[1:03:12] desire this morning to become more like
[1:03:14] him because he promised us that if the
[1:03:18] same spirit that was in him dwelt in
[1:03:22] US it would Quicken our bodies and take
[1:03:27] us to where he
[1:03:30] is and we know he went somewhere because
[1:03:34] we have witness that he rose and we
[1:03:38] heard a Vindicated message telling us
[1:03:41] that he would come again and that we
[1:03:44] would be caught up together with him in
[1:03:47] the air ever to be with the Lord just
[1:03:51] think we're not far from heaven we not
[1:03:55] far far from eternal life being
[1:03:58] manifested in us the eternal life we've
[1:04:00] always had so we're so grateful for that
[1:04:04] also uh they mentioned uh brother mani
[1:04:08] and the whole sing family uh his mother
[1:04:11] just had a very extensive uh brain
[1:04:15] surgery and yet I went and visited her
[1:04:18] and she's full of joy and and laughter
[1:04:22] and the spirit and the family
[1:04:25] and uh her man's mom or sister's husband
[1:04:30] and and M's sister was there the hosting
[1:04:33] family and their faith is in a
[1:04:37] resurrected Lord Jesus so if you could
[1:04:40] through the week maybe reach out to him
[1:04:42] and the family uh give them a call let
[1:04:45] them know that you're praying for him
[1:04:47] send it a text uh just encourage them a
[1:04:51] along the way amen and and I thought uh

[1:09:09] him Lord
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] Jesus we love you this
[1:09:17] morning because you first loved
[1:09:20] us and you loved us so much that you
[1:09:23] gave your your only begotten
[1:09:25] son and paid the price for our sin and
[1:09:29] the penalty of death that we might be
[1:09:31] free this morning in newness of Life
[1:09:34] resurrected on this Sunday morning able
[1:09:36] to Worship You Lord in spirit and in
[1:09:39] truth Lord now we're we're looking to
[1:09:42] you the author and the finisher of our
[1:09:45] faith Lord maybe I feel a little bit
[1:09:47] like that boy that came to the hillside
[1:09:50] that day with just a couple fishes and a
[1:09:53] few loaves of bread and he didn't
[1:09:57] have much
[1:10:00] but when he placed what he had into your
[1:10:03] hands it was
[1:10:05] enough Lord that's my heart's desire
[1:10:08] we've pinned down just a few notes
[1:10:12] and Lord in its own it wouldn't be
[1:10:15] enough but Lord if you would just take
[1:10:16] it now there will be leftovers Lord that
[1:10:20] the saints of God can feed
[1:10:22] on we love you we just commit ourselves
[1:10:25] we ask that you'd come Lord now and
[1:10:26] break the bread of Life feed your sheep
[1:10:29] Lord I
[1:10:31] pray in your name the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] we ask it amen praise the Lord if you
[1:10:37] have your Bibles you'll turn in James
[1:10:39] chapter
[1:10:44] 1 amen we just uh before we get started
[1:10:47] want to um just thank all the
[1:10:50] helpers and uh the youth leaders and
[1:10:54] those that came together uh to provide
[1:10:57] um the Christmas dinner that was for the
[1:11:00] Youth um so we had a good time I believe
[1:11:04] did we have a good
[1:11:05] time we had a good time just coming
[1:11:08] together and fellowshipping and
[1:11:10] appreciated what our pastor um shared
[1:11:15] with the youth um it might not have been
[1:11:18] um you know it was about 20 25 minutes
[1:11:22] but if you will meditate on those things
[1:11:23] could be extremely
[1:11:25] impactful um that you are not what you
[1:11:27] think you are and you could you could
[1:11:31] look at that on both sides of the
[1:11:33] spectrum that maybe you see yourself
[1:11:36] through the negative uh but that's not
[1:11:39] really what you think you are is not
[1:11:42] really who you are and then even on the
[1:11:43] positive side the very things that lay
[1:11:46] in the word of God and the Revelation
[1:11:48] that we've received of who we are well
[1:11:50] we're really not who we think we are yet
[1:11:52] because there's we just just don't even
[1:11:53] have the capacity that's right in this
[1:11:56] life to really comprehend what God has
[1:11:59] made us and so it's just a journey that
[1:12:02] we're on so we really appreciated that
[1:12:05] but just reading in our Bibles we'll uh
[1:12:08] read verse
[1:12:10] 17 here in the the Book of James chapter
[1:12:18] 1 it says every good gift and every
[1:12:23] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[1:12:28] down from the Father of Lights with whom
[1:12:31] is no variableness neither shadow of
[1:12:35] turning we ask a blessing upon the
[1:12:36] reading of the word you may have your
[1:12:38] seats every good
[1:12:41] gift and every perfect
[1:12:44] gift is from
[1:12:46] above but I like that next portion of
[1:12:49] the Scripture it says and cometh
[1:12:52] down I like like that and cometh down
[1:12:55] every good gift and every perfect gift
[1:12:58] comes down amen so if God has a good
[1:13:01] gift or a perfect gift it's something
[1:13:03] that God brings down or comes down and
[1:13:05] he gives to you it Cometh From The
[1:13:08] Father of Lights with whom is no
[1:13:10] variableness neither shadow of turning
[1:13:14] and I was just kind of looking at that
[1:13:17] scripture it says every good gift and
[1:13:20] every perfect gift and maybe if you're
[1:13:23] to look into that word good you know
[1:13:25] what does that even mean every good gift
[1:13:27] and every perfect gift but one of the
[1:13:30] things that the word good would mean is
[1:13:32] something that's
[1:13:34] useful and we're right now in a in a
[1:13:37] Christmas time and you know um you want
[1:13:41] to get someone something good don't you
[1:13:44] right you know you're always trying to
[1:13:45] think within yourself what can I get
[1:13:47] them they already maybe you feel like
[1:13:50] they have everything and and and maybe
[1:13:52] you've got them things in the past but
[1:13:55] you know you start to think within
[1:13:56] yourself well I want to get them
[1:13:57] something good I I I want to get them
[1:14:00] maybe something uh uh that is useful you
[1:14:02] don't want to give something to to
[1:14:05] somebody that they really don't need it
[1:14:08] you know cuz you you want them to be
[1:14:10] able to to maybe uh uh put it into
[1:14:13] action or have use of it you know I mean
[1:14:15] if if if somebody doesn't play football
[1:14:19] and you buy him a football uh they they
[1:14:22] might thank you for it but they they
[1:14:23] really don't have any use for it it's
[1:14:26] really not any good to them it's it's
[1:14:28] really not useful so so you want to give
[1:14:32] somebody something that's good that that
[1:14:34] can be useful that they can uh put into
[1:14:37] action maybe something that they can
[1:14:39] wear or or something that will help them
[1:14:41] many times you know it comes to the to
[1:14:43] the uh the season of time you're
[1:14:45] thinking about something you want to get
[1:14:47] your mom or or your wife or something
[1:14:49] that's why moms have maybe 10 or 12
[1:14:52] aprons in their jawer and they they have
[1:14:54] a million spatulas that they don't know
[1:14:57] what to do with every single one of them
[1:14:58] but but you're wanting to be thoughtful
[1:15:01] you're you're wanting to give them
[1:15:02] something that that can be useful and
[1:15:04] and so you try to think of something you
[1:15:06] know they're they're Homemakers and so
[1:15:08] you try to think of something that you
[1:15:10] could give them that would help them in
[1:15:12] and maybe a daily use that would be
[1:15:14] something uh a good
[1:15:16] gift you would say something useful so
[1:15:21] you know uh and that's why around
[1:15:23] Christmas times you get things that you
[1:15:29] need I'm sorry kids but you're going to
[1:15:32] get socks for
[1:15:35] Christmas because it's useful everybody
[1:15:39] need socks I'll never forget one time we
[1:15:41] you know we were we're having our
[1:15:43] Christmas we were a little younger
[1:15:45] during them days and and uh we were all
[1:15:48] gathered around and there were some
[1:15:49] Believers that had come through town uh
[1:15:51] conveniently on Christmas Day and and so
[1:15:54] uh we got to spend Christmas with with
[1:15:56] some Believers that were passing through
[1:15:58] and and as we would open our little
[1:16:00] presence there sitting on the couch and
[1:16:03] and we would open up and there they were
[1:16:05] the brother and sister with both arms up
[1:16:07] on the back of the couch just peering
[1:16:09] right over our shoulders and and every
[1:16:11] time we would we would get something I
[1:16:12] think they were just as surprised as we
[1:16:14] were and I'll never forget one time we
[1:16:17] we started to open up the little gift
[1:16:19] there and uh we opened it up and guess
[1:16:21] what it was so socks and the brother and
[1:16:26] sister goes
[1:16:28] socks what was it it was
[1:16:31] socks but you know what that's what
[1:16:34] happens around the Christmas time you
[1:16:36] you get things you
[1:16:37] need you you get things like clothes and
[1:16:41] and socks because maybe maybe you don't
[1:16:44] think oh my goodness I was expecting a
[1:16:46] Sega Genesis or well you really don't
[1:16:48] need that it might be something that you
[1:16:50] want but many times during this season
[1:16:53] you're you're wanting to uh uh give
[1:16:56] something that's good something that's
[1:16:58] useful something that somebody can put
[1:17:00] into action that they can they can
[1:17:03] appreciate it you know and so I want to
[1:17:05] say if you have a need right if you have
[1:17:09] a need well many times what happens
[1:17:12] around has anybody ever been asked what
[1:17:14] do you want for
[1:17:17] Christmas well that was a demanding
[1:17:20] resounding
[1:17:22] nobody all right so if you didn't know
[1:17:25] around this time of year we call it
[1:17:28] Christmas time you know sometimes uh
[1:17:31] people might ask you what would you like
[1:17:33] for Christmas and and so that would be
[1:17:35] your opportunity to say you know what um
[1:17:39] you know I I have need of this you know
[1:17:42] you have not because you ask
[1:17:44] not right and so if somebody's asking
[1:17:47] you um hey what would you like for
[1:17:49] Christmas well if you have a need that
[1:17:51] would be a good time time to say you
[1:17:54] know what I I I I I I I I need a new
[1:17:57] shirt for for for for church or I need
[1:17:59] something for for school I need a tie I
[1:18:02] need something and then so I would say
[1:18:04] that maybe when it comes around that
[1:18:06] time and and maybe a couple gifts have
[1:18:08] been given to you and you have a
[1:18:11] need and you've been given a gift it
[1:18:14] might be a good
[1:18:16] idea to open
[1:18:19] up the gift and see what's inside
[1:18:23] because there's a good
[1:18:25] chance that the
[1:18:28] gift will meet the
[1:18:31] need and the prophet of God would say um
[1:18:35] in this sermon God's wrapped gift he
[1:18:37] would say that's the only way anybody in
[1:18:41] the world will ever know what's in the
[1:18:43] package it has to be revealed to you
[1:18:46] you'll turn it down and say it's
[1:18:48] fanaticism but when you get the
[1:18:51] Revelation you'll seek for it you'll
[1:18:54] open up and God will come in and Su with
[1:18:57] you and you with him when you're ready
[1:19:01] to open the door let them in that little
[1:19:04] package Knocking at Your Heart the
[1:19:08] greatest Christmas gift was ever given
[1:19:12] the first one and the greatest one that
[1:19:16] little package knocking at the heart of
[1:19:20] the man I'll come in and suck you'll
[1:19:24] never know it until it's revealed to you
[1:19:28] and when it's revealed to you then
[1:19:31] you'll go hunting for it I say if you
[1:19:34] have a need and it's being revealed to
[1:19:36] you and he's knocking at your heart you
[1:19:39] open up be go hunting for the very
[1:19:41] things that God has to offer
[1:19:44] you that's God's greatest gift to you is
[1:19:48] that what is the prophet saying that God
[1:19:50] would knock at your heart and that you
[1:19:52] you would open up the door and he would
[1:19:55] come
[1:19:56] in and Su with you I want to ask you if
[1:19:58] you have a need in your life this
[1:20:01] morning if there's something that you're
[1:20:03] Desiring if there's something that
[1:20:05] you're hungering for God is here this
[1:20:09] morning and he's knocking at your
[1:20:12] heart and if you'll just let him in he
[1:20:15] said I will come in and S with you oh
[1:20:19] that is the greatest gift that has ever
[1:20:22] been given to mankind that God would
[1:20:26] knock at your heart and that you could
[1:20:29] open up your heart and the king of glory
[1:20:33] could come into your heart oh how could
[1:20:36] the king of glory the creator of heavens
[1:20:38] and earth the one that fashioned the
[1:20:41] trees and the mountains and he carved
[1:20:43] out the Landscapes with the rivers and
[1:20:46] oh what a great display all over the
[1:20:49] universe from the little things all the
[1:20:51] way up to the sky and and and the
[1:20:54] shining stars and the planets and the
[1:20:57] Milky Ways and Beyond oh it's past
[1:20:59] finding out that the God who created all
[1:21:02] of those things this morning he's
[1:21:05] knocking at your heart oh it's the
[1:21:07] greatest gift that man has ever known
[1:21:11] that God would come in and suck with
[1:21:14] you
[1:21:16] Hallelujah you have a need you have
[1:21:20] something that you want amen the
[1:21:22] greatest gift oh my it's more it's more
[1:21:27] than just a good
[1:21:30] gift a good gift can be something useful
[1:21:33] yes it can be something
[1:21:34] temporary I I think of the nine
[1:21:37] spiritual gifts oh they're wonderful
[1:21:39] they're gifts of the Spirit
[1:21:42] right but you know the scripture says
[1:21:44] I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:21:47] so then just and
[1:21:49] unjust balum prophesied but yet he
[1:21:52] wasn't a doer of the word he wanted his
[1:21:54] own way
[1:21:55] right did true words proceed out of
[1:21:58] balam's mouth certainly true words
[1:22:01] proceeded out of balam's mouth he he
[1:22:03] prophesied one of the greatest
[1:22:05] prophecies ever spoken about Israel said
[1:22:07] a star shall arise out of Jacob and that
[1:22:11] was the very prophecy that the Magi were
[1:22:14] following because the word had been
[1:22:16] spoken but yet in that that gift of
[1:22:19] Prophecy that balam had or he was not a
[1:22:21] true word Prophet because he was not a
[1:22:24] doer of the word I I I I want the
[1:22:27] perfect gift I want Christ himself in
[1:22:30] myself I might not be able to do all the
[1:22:32] work but if I'll open my heart to him
[1:22:37] Lord I've come short I've fallen short I
[1:22:39] can't keep all of your ways I can't keep
[1:22:42] all of your statutes oh but if the the
[1:22:44] the perfect gift will come in this
[1:22:46] morning you're knocking at my heart if
[1:22:48] I'll just let you in if you'll just come
[1:22:50] into the command Tower if you'll just
[1:22:53] take control of my life if I can just
[1:22:56] have communion and if I can just sck
[1:22:59] with you oh oh gifts are good uhh gifts
[1:23:02] out in the church are good they're
[1:23:03] wonderful we need those things Lord but
[1:23:05] I want more than just a spiritual gift I
[1:23:08] want the
[1:23:09] giver I want The Giver of the gift which
[1:23:13] is the greatest gift which is the
[1:23:15] perfect gift which is here this
[1:23:18] morning oh don't let that be far from
[1:23:20] your heart he's here this morning
[1:23:23] right now present tense knocking on the
[1:23:26] door of each one of your hearts I'm
[1:23:27] wondering will you let them
[1:23:29] in will you have communion with him will
[1:23:31] you suck with
[1:23:33] him that's the time of year that we're
[1:23:36] living
[1:23:38] in it's a Christmas season a time of
[1:23:41] giving and providing for needs you
[1:23:44] know Humanity goes through great efforts
[1:23:46] during this time you know they they got
[1:23:48] their soup kitchens and uh they do their
[1:23:51] uh toys for HS and the Salvation Army is
[1:23:55] is is out collecting and they have hope
[1:23:57] for Humanity and all of these things and
[1:24:00] these great efforts that's going out
[1:24:02] because that's the the season it's a
[1:24:05] season of of of giving and and there's
[1:24:07] there's so many efforts going out to
[1:24:11] provide for the needs and you know I
[1:24:13] asked the question what do you want for
[1:24:17] Christmas good that's easy I didn't hear
[1:24:20] a
[1:24:21] word
[1:24:23] what do you want for Christmas
[1:24:26] amen I'll think about it that's okay
[1:24:29] what what do you what do you want for
[1:24:30] Christmas you want
[1:24:33] clothes you want
[1:24:37] money what do you have need of maybe
[1:24:39] that's a better
[1:24:41] question you know the Bible would say
[1:24:45] that if you ask for something be in
[1:24:47] prayer believing you shall receive it
[1:24:50] amen maybe we'll turn there in Matthew
[1:25:14] 21 Matthew 21 verse
[1:25:20] 22 says and all things whatsoever you
[1:25:24] shall ask in prayer
[1:25:26] believing you shall receive it amen you
[1:25:30] know as I thought about these things in
[1:25:32] the Christmas
[1:25:34] season I thought about this you know
[1:25:36] we're always wondering what we
[1:25:39] want I thought what happens we as if we
[1:25:42] ask God what he
[1:25:44] wanted I think that's a worthy
[1:25:46] question Lord what what do you want for
[1:25:51] Christmas have you ever pondered that
[1:25:53] what maybe the Lord would want from you
[1:25:55] maybe what you could even give
[1:25:59] him I kind of was thinking about that
[1:26:03] Lord you you've done so much for me and
[1:26:06] you've done so much for us Lord what
[1:26:08] what could I do for you and it just come
[1:26:11] to my
[1:26:12] heart there uh brother
[1:26:14] Brandon would would make mention and say
[1:26:17] well how how do how do we
[1:26:20] know that he loves us
[1:26:23] Hallelujah by believing what he said how
[1:26:25] do we show our love to
[1:26:28] him by believeing that's what he's
[1:26:31] asking you to do believe him you want to
[1:26:33] know what you can do for the Lord what
[1:26:35] he would ask for you to do this morning
[1:26:37] believe what he
[1:26:38] said believe
[1:26:40] him with all of your heart
[1:26:43] believe believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:26:45] believe his word believe believe what
[1:26:48] he's saying so I ask you what what are
[1:26:50] you giving him you know we're always
[1:26:52] asking uh uh what what you can receive
[1:26:55] but really The Season's about giving
[1:26:57] it's a time of giving I ask what are we
[1:26:59] giving unto the
[1:27:00] Lord what is it that we would have to
[1:27:02] offer him I know in ourselves we have
[1:27:04] nothing to offer but oh if we can just
[1:27:06] offer him our lives and we could offer
[1:27:08] him our heart if if we could come before
[1:27:10] him Lord I I I don't have much to give
[1:27:12] Lord but what I do have Lord I lay it
[1:27:14] down at your feet Here I Am Lord I I
[1:27:17] want to Worship You Lord I I want to
[1:27:19] give you my life Lord I I want to give
[1:27:21] you of my time and Lord even my efforts
[1:27:23] and all those things my works oh that's
[1:27:26] that's meaningless to you Lord but if if
[1:27:28] I could do anything Lord let me believe
[1:27:29] you let me take you at your word oh
[1:27:32] that's his heart's desire that that you
[1:27:34] would believe him and conduct yourself
[1:27:37] with joy in the midst of the trials that
[1:27:39] him and his wisdom has allowed to come
[1:27:40] to
[1:27:41] pass if you want to do anything if you
[1:27:44] want to do something for God I would say
[1:27:46] let's believe him let's take him at his
[1:27:48] word so many times we we we come short
[1:27:51] of taking God at his word he's asking
[1:27:55] you look try me that's one thing in the
[1:27:58] Bible he says try me about your tithes I
[1:28:00] try
[1:28:01] them some of us maybe are not uh uh uh
[1:28:04] uh um uh me making in meets like we
[1:28:08] would like to because we think we're the
[1:28:10] ones stretching the
[1:28:11] dollar we we think we're the ones being
[1:28:14] Frugal we're think we're cutting out
[1:28:17] coupons and saving all this money and
[1:28:19] say well I'll just pay my ties next time
[1:28:23] I say give God first and watch him
[1:28:25] stretch your dollar oh he can stretch a
[1:28:28] $1 bill into a million dollar bill if

[1:30:04] need been crying out for something
[1:30:07] amen you know there's a time in the
[1:30:10] Bible where Israel had come into
[1:30:14] bondage and they were crying out for a
[1:30:17] deliverer they had a
[1:30:20] need the the their burden was becoming
[1:30:23] more they they were sick and
[1:30:26] tired of being whipped they were sick
[1:30:29] and tired of making bricks for the
[1:30:33] Egyptians and the scripture says they
[1:30:35] started to cry out and the cries came up
[1:30:37] before God Amen all right they had a
[1:30:42] need they started crying out and what
[1:30:45] did God
[1:30:47] do he sent them a
[1:30:49] deliverer the prophet of God said said
[1:30:53] that Moses was a gift to
[1:30:55] Israel do you know it's an amazing thing
[1:30:58] he would come around and show how that
[1:31:00] when he came he says the people weren't
[1:31:02] ready to receive him he said Moses going
[1:31:05] into the Wilderness for 40 years and the
[1:31:08] waiting of
[1:31:10] Israel was not because of Moses see many
[1:31:15] times when the prophet will take it down
[1:31:16] on a personal level he'll use Moses as
[1:31:19] the example and Moses trying to use
[1:31:21] ability but you come out to the age or
[1:31:23] to the group because all God always
[1:31:25] deals with a group of people and he
[1:31:27] shows how the group he says they The
[1:31:29] Waiting wasn't on Moses part The Waiting
[1:31:32] was on Israel's part because they were
[1:31:34] not ready to receive the very thing they
[1:31:38] were asking
[1:31:39] for think about it
[1:31:42] now now you've been praying you've been
[1:31:45] asking you've been crying out I wonder
[1:31:49] if Christ has not been here
[1:31:52] trying to give you the very thing that
[1:31:55] you've been asking for but you haven't
[1:31:57] been ready to receive
[1:32:04] it my that's a an interesting way to
[1:32:08] look at
[1:32:09] it to think that God is here in every
[1:32:12] Fountain of Life wanting to pour himself
[1:32:14] into your life Hallelujah into your
[1:32:16] situation into your heart and the very
[1:32:20] thing the very waiting it's we're not
[1:32:22] waiting on God he's here he's here to
[1:32:26] fulfill his word what we're waiting on
[1:32:28] is the individual and their
[1:32:33] heart you hear
[1:32:35] that what is
[1:32:37] it it's the greatest
[1:32:41] gift the greatest gift man has ever
[1:32:49] received God's love gift
[1:32:53] amen is that not the greatest
[1:32:57] gift I I I is is the Son of God not the
[1:33:00] greatest love gift that God ever gave to
[1:33:03] humanity now I know you're message
[1:33:05] Believers I know you love the
[1:33:07] Bible if anything you can amen
[1:33:15] that God loves you yes
[1:33:18] sir he's here for
[1:33:20] you
[1:33:22] and
[1:33:23] sometimes the waiting
[1:33:26] is is in ourselves where you know what
[1:33:28] maybe I'm hanging on to
[1:33:31] something maybe I'm just not sick and
[1:33:33] tired and sick and
[1:33:35] tired I'll never forget one time uh
[1:33:38] before I started serving the lord you
[1:33:39] know I was I I I was I was I was I I
[1:33:43] wanted to be delivered and so you know
[1:33:45] what I did I sighed and cried I I
[1:33:47] remember driving my pathfinder down the
[1:33:49] road and and I got out of my my my
[1:33:52] vehicle and I climbed down in a ditch
[1:33:54] and I cried out before God and I wanted
[1:33:56] to be
[1:33:58] delivered because I really didn't
[1:34:02] like being in bondage but I kind of
[1:34:05] liked the effects of
[1:34:08] it I I cried out for God but you know I
[1:34:10] really wasn't ready to give it
[1:34:13] up I kind of was still holding on to
[1:34:15] some things cuz sometimes you know we we
[1:34:17] give into indulgences and we give into
[1:34:20] certain things and a and and and we feel
[1:34:22] condemned and and really what we don't
[1:34:24] like is we don't like the the conviction
[1:34:27] we don't like how it makes us feel dirty
[1:34:29] so we want that go to go away but but
[1:34:31] that really you know there's a part of
[1:34:33] us that you know we kind of like
[1:34:35] it so we go through
[1:34:39] Cycles we we you know we get under
[1:34:41] conviction and and and you know we you
[1:34:44] know it's time I I'll clean up my life
[1:34:46] and and you know what I really want to
[1:34:48] be delivered and and so then you you
[1:34:50] feel good you made a step in the right
[1:34:51] direction but but you know what happens
[1:34:53] just just it just takes a little bit of
[1:34:55] time and all of a sudden that that one
[1:34:57] little step here and that one little
[1:34:59] step there and all of a sudden you
[1:35:00] wonder why you're starting to to do the
[1:35:02] same things you used to
[1:35:07] do and I realized that I had I had I had
[1:35:10] cried out to God but but God was waiting
[1:35:13] on
[1:35:14] me he wasn't I wasn't waiting on God
[1:35:18] lord here I am I'm ready to receive the
[1:35:20] Holy Ghost and if you'll just hurry up
[1:35:22] the program here you said oh no no
[1:35:25] that's not the God we
[1:35:27] serve but I want to tell you when you're
[1:35:30] ready yes to lay it all down Hallelujah

[1:35:56] be revered by my peers I don't need
[1:35:59] anybody to think I'm anybody I I you
[1:36:01] know I I I I I I I don't I don't need to
[1:36:04] be successful in this world I I thought
[1:36:07] I needed a a career and I thought I
[1:36:08] needed to buy a car and I I thought I
[1:36:11] needed to do all these things Lord but
[1:36:12] really they're just taking me further
[1:36:14] away from you Lord I'm ready to lay it
[1:36:16] all down lord I I I haven't been waiting
[1:36:20] on you but but you've been waiting on me
[1:36:23] and and you've been knocking at my heart
[1:36:25] this whole time you've been wanting to
[1:36:27] come in and sck with me and and be the
[1:36:30] greatest gift that perfect gift that
[1:36:33] would provide for all the needs that
[1:36:35] I've been running
[1:36:37] after
[1:36:39] amen you come to that
[1:36:41] place and I came to that place one time
[1:36:44] where I had had
[1:36:47] enough and I made a move for God and he
[1:36:50] made a move move for me he was knocking
[1:36:53] on my heart and I said Lord come in I'm
[1:36:58] ready Lord I don't want anything of this
[1:37:01] world and the greatest gift what the
[1:37:06] gift of himself the gift of the Holy
[1:37:08] Ghost the gift of eternal life could
[1:37:10] come in that's exactly what Moses was
[1:37:15] doing for the the children of Israel
[1:37:18] is it was God's gift to take the people
[1:37:22] out of the condition that they were
[1:37:26] in now now just follow for a moment
[1:37:30] we're just trusting in the leadership of
[1:37:32] the Holy Ghost if you could uh stay with
[1:37:34] us for a few more moments but the very
[1:37:36] thing that they had need
[1:37:39] of the prophet of God said that God came
[1:37:42] down and was going in the form of a man
[1:37:44] amen so it was the very
[1:37:47] messenger that God sent to the church
[1:37:51] to provide the needs of the
[1:37:54] people right that the children of Israel
[1:37:56] they needed
[1:37:58] Deliverance they were under
[1:38:00] taskmasters uh you know they were under
[1:38:02] Creeds and dogmas and they were they
[1:38:04] were under the rulership of man and they
[1:38:07] were crying out for deliverance so what
[1:38:09] did God do God sent them a gift in the
[1:38:14] form of a prophet to provide the needs
[1:38:18] that they had needed they said Lord I
[1:38:20] need to be
[1:38:21] deler I need a change I need you to come
[1:38:25] on the scene and so the very thing that
[1:38:28] they were praying for came in the form
[1:38:31] of the Prophet
[1:38:33] Moses think of it
[1:38:37] now now sometimes the waiting is all
[1:38:40] because we are not
[1:38:43] recognizing what God has provided for
[1:38:46] the need
[1:38:48] W that's
[1:38:50] right
[1:38:51] you you you want healing you want
[1:38:53] Deliverance you want salvation you want
[1:38:55] justification you want the baptism of
[1:38:57] the Holy Ghost you want a body change
[1:39:00] you want a body change I don't know
[1:39:03] about you but I want a body
[1:39:05] change I want to get out of
[1:39:08] here well if those are the things that
[1:39:10] you're praying for if those things are
[1:39:12] the things that you're Desiring look God
[1:39:14] has provided us a message he's provided
[1:39:17] us a prophet that brought the Word of
[1:39:19] Deliverance that could take us into all
[1:39:21] those things and meet the need that we
[1:39:24] have I hope you're following me
[1:39:27] there that's what Israel was crying out
[1:39:32] for but they weren't ready to receive
[1:39:36] it but I would say to you this
[1:39:39] morning accept his
[1:39:42] gift he knew you before the foundation
[1:39:44] of the
[1:39:46] world he knew what you had need
[1:39:50] of
[1:39:53] let the gift take care of
[1:39:54] it that would be my thought to
[1:39:59] you this
[1:40:01] morning let the gift take care of
[1:40:08] it you know God has given you the
[1:40:12] greatest gift that you could ever
[1:40:16] have and sometimes God's gifts comes in
[1:40:19] different forms
[1:40:23] the Son of God was wrapped in swallowing
[1:40:26] claws in a
[1:40:28] Manger it didn't look like the greatest
[1:40:32] gift if we were all gathering around and
[1:40:35] we were judging this one we would say
[1:40:37] that's the best he
[1:40:39] gots all the the that's
[1:40:42] it I mean the you're telling me the
[1:40:45] creator of heavens and earth and and the
[1:40:48] greatest gift he could ever give to
[1:40:51] mankind is I is a baby wrapped in stinky
[1:40:56] Linens in in a in a
[1:41:01] barn oh but see it takes Revelation to
[1:41:04] really know what's
[1:41:06] there and friends I want to tell you we
[1:41:10] need God to give us a revelation of this
[1:41:12] message it has to be wrapped that's
[1:41:15] right to you individually and to you
[1:41:19] personally for you to start understand
[1:41:21] the value for you to start to understand
[1:41:24] the importance for the needs that are in
[1:41:26] your life when the message of the hour
[1:41:28] starts to become a revelation and you
[1:41:30] realize that things start falling off of
[1:41:33] your life and and questions you had all
[1:41:35] of all of your life they become to
[1:41:37] become answered and the Victory you
[1:41:39] wanted over shortfalls and besetting
[1:41:41] sins you start to get Deliverance why
[1:41:43] because it's in the gift that God has
[1:41:45] provided but we got to unwrap it it it
[1:41:48] has to be revealed oh on the outside it
[1:41:51] it might not look like much it might
[1:41:52] have looked like a a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:41:55] that that had come with no education but
[1:41:57] oh if you could understand what was
[1:41:59] behind the gift
[1:42:01] wrapping it was God veiling himself
[1:42:04] inside of a man God had come down every
[1:42:08] good gift and every perfect gift comes
[1:42:12] down from the Father of Lights I don't
[1:42:15] want to say that God has come
[1:42:18] down Hallelujah right right in an age
[1:42:21] that had the greatest need there was the
[1:42:24] greatest Darkness the world had gone
[1:42:26] into complete apostasy there seemed like
[1:42:29] there was no hope but God by Divine
[1:42:32] promise came down I want to say it was
[1:42:36] the greatest gift this age had ever seen
[1:42:39] that God would Veil himself in the
[1:42:41] ministry of the son of man that could
[1:42:44] discern the thoughts and intents of your
[1:42:45] heart and he could meet your need oh if
[1:42:48] you could just look past the Veil
[1:42:51] Hallelujah and see Jesus Christ standing
[1:42:54] before you the same yesterday today and
[1:42:57] forever but many people don't want it
[1:42:59] because of the gift
[1:43:01] wrapping could you imagine getting a
[1:43:03] gift and be like nah I ain't going to
[1:43:05] open
[1:43:06] that I don't want to open
[1:43:09] that why don't you want to open it's
[1:43:11] just Brown it looks like
[1:43:14] cardboard well I mean why don't you just
[1:43:16] go ahead and open up and look inside no
[1:43:18] no I already looked at it it doesn't
[1:43:20] matter that's my ecclesiastical ideas oh
[1:43:23] my it's not it's not glittering and
[1:43:26] glamouring it ain't screaming and
[1:43:28] shouting like I want it to you know I
[1:43:29] just don't really you know it just
[1:43:31] doesn't really catch my
[1:43:33] attention Okay well
[1:43:35] yeah if that's how you feel about
[1:43:38] it there he is the savior of the
[1:43:42] world laying there in a
[1:43:45] Manger but before you pass judgment so
[1:43:48] quick how many of you try to guess
[1:43:51] what's inside the
[1:43:54] package you get
[1:43:57] it you shake
[1:44:00] it you ever guessed
[1:44:03] right you just know what it is some
[1:44:06] people know it is you know that's what a
[1:44:09] lot of people have done they have taken
[1:44:10] the message they just shake it
[1:44:13] around yeah yeah it sounds like that
[1:44:15] sounds good I can serpent seed water
[1:44:19] baptism m 45 yeah you know this all
[1:44:23] sounds good I like it packing around I
[1:44:25] got the message I got the message of the
[1:44:28] hour yep God sent a prophet yeah can you
[1:44:31] believe that think of all the signs and
[1:44:32] the Wonders and everything yeah that was
[1:44:34] done around the world seven times the
[1:44:36] first pull the second pull all those
[1:44:39] things you're not telling the
[1:44:41] Pentecostals anything they don't already
[1:44:43] know some of them MERS go around talk to
[1:44:46] them they'll tell you about the meetings
[1:44:48] they'll tell you about the power they'll
[1:44:49] tell you about all those things but you
[1:44:51] know one thing they never did they never
[1:44:53] unwrapped the
[1:44:54] gift that's right it was never revealed
[1:44:57] to them that's right cuz one time I was
[1:44:59] fellowship with a a Pentecostal Pastor
[1:45:03] i' been pastoring for years and he was
[1:45:05] familiar with the ministry and and so
[1:45:06] when I got to that place I started to
[1:45:08] tell him he said he said oh he looked at
[1:45:10] me and with his with his eyes set he
[1:45:13] said oh son but you what you need to
[1:45:15] know is at the end of his ministry he
[1:45:18] got off and something spoke to he said
[1:45:20] no sir you got off because it was a
[1:45:23] train that was bound for Glory it was
[1:45:26] God's gift to take us out of this war
[1:45:29] torn wretched generation that had
[1:45:32] crucified our Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:45:34] second time oh but behind the veil it
[1:45:37] was none other than Jesus Christ the
[1:45:39] same yesterday today and forever he was
[1:45:42] taking you
[1:45:43] somewhere but if you never open it up if
[1:45:46] you never get the real Revelation and
[1:45:49] actually allow the message of the hour
[1:45:50] to come into your

[1:48:29] wondering we're all looking to what man
[1:48:31] can explain it the
[1:48:33] best and how he can trace it down
[1:48:35] through the scriptures and then we'll
[1:48:37] have a group meeting and we'll vote on
[1:48:38] who we think is
[1:48:40] right but God bypassed all of man's
[1:48:44] theology he just like it was in the
[1:48:46] Garden of Eden when his children had a
[1:48:49] need he said I'm gonna come down myself
[1:48:53] Hallelujah God knew this bride needed a
[1:48:56] fresh word of Revelation and he didn't
[1:48:59] just leave it to a man but he said I
[1:49:01] will come down myself because every good
[1:49:05] gift and every perfect gift cometh down
[1:49:08] from the father of lights and according
[1:49:10] to Divine promise God has come down and
[1:49:13] spoken lip to ear through the profit of
[1:49:16] the hour to his bride that you might

[1:49:36] shall cleanse you from all your
[1:49:39] sins oh what a
[1:49:42] gift what a

[1:51:27] of her
[1:51:29] life she tried to fix it and tried to
[1:51:31] let somebody else fix it it just seemed
[1:51:33] like it was making it worse and worse

[2:03:18] came to Jesus come on just keep there
[2:03:21] that's
[2:03:22] great see how long he can do it that

[2:03:41] Lord now she came with the right
[2:03:43] approach if if I can just hold it with
[2:03:45] my pinky Lord if it's just a little
[2:03:48] scrap right I'll take whatever you give
[2:03:50] me but he wants to give you more than
[2:03:53] that when you come with the right of
[2:03:54] proor
[2:03:56] analogy take this you can't just
[2:03:58] remember
[2:04:00] that it's like we're asking the Lord
[2:04:03] Lord can you please give me this this
[2:04:05] and this and he's over here trying to
[2:04:06] give it to you and you're just holding
[2:04:09] everything but if you'll just finally
[2:04:12] start laying it down to say
[2:04:14] Lord you know what I've been holding way
[2:04:17] too much stuff
[2:04:19] I'm ready to lay it all down here is the
[2:04:23] revealed word of the hour why don't you
[2:04:25] take this then you can grab thank you
[2:04:27] then you can grab a hold of
[2:04:29] it but the problem is we're holding on
[2:04:33] to too many ideas we're holding on to
[2:04:36] too much uh intellectual thinking we're
[2:04:39] holding on look we I tell you what
[2:04:42] message people have become really good
[2:04:45] theologians that's right that's right I
[2:04:47] mean we're the best best of the best you
[2:04:50] want to talk about a sadducee and a
[2:04:52] Pharisee we can we can clean a cup and a
[2:04:54] pot cleaner than anybody could ever
[2:04:56] clean
[2:04:57] it
[2:04:59] yeah I'm a message believer look at me
[2:05:04] you can't tell me nothing I've heard the
[2:05:05] seven
[2:05:07] Thunders I am I am and you are not
[2:05:11] anything like our Lord was that's right
[2:05:14] Meek
[2:05:16] lowly riding on a Don
[2:05:20] yes
[2:05:21] oh because sometimes when you don't have
[2:05:25] the giver inside you don't have anything
[2:05:27] to
[2:05:28] give oh and that's
[2:05:31] something oh my we we all we all want it
[2:05:34] all we want to do all the works we want
[2:05:37] to we want to toot our horn we want to
[2:05:39] be message Believers we want to push all
[2:05:41] the denominations and all the
[2:05:43] Pentecostals below us oh no that's not
[2:05:46] never one thing our Lord did right he
[2:05:49] was there to seek and save that was lost
[2:05:52] think of Acts now think of think of I
[2:05:55] believe it was Peter at the gate called
[2:05:58] Beautiful talking about a need right
[2:06:00] here comes Peter he said Silver and Gold
[2:06:03] Have I None but the need that you have I
[2:06:08] got the need I got the need meter right
[2:06:11] here inside of me Silver and Gold hav't
[2:06:14] on you don't need silver and gold but
[2:06:16] that which I have it's way a worth more
[2:06:19] than silver and gold it's worth more
[2:06:21] than an education it's worth more than a
[2:06:23] good job it's worth more than a good car
[2:06:26] it's worth more than a good
[2:06:28] house that which I had rise up Peter had
[2:06:34] something to give why because the giver
[2:06:38] he had received the greatest
[2:06:42] gift what does our text say the Father
[2:06:46] of Lights yes yes
[2:06:49] ye are the light of the world so where
[2:06:54] is the light of this word now it is in
[2:06:57] the
[2:06:58] bride you are the light of the world you
[2:07:02] have something to
[2:07:04] give
[2:07:07] right but if you find yourself
[2:07:10] empty if you feel like there's something
[2:07:13] they're not to give back to our
[2:07:17] text
[2:07:21] the woman said to
[2:07:22] him give me this
[2:07:25] water I wonder if we can just come to
[2:07:27] this portion in the

[2:08:34] woman answered and said I have no
[2:08:38] husband it's good to be honest with

[2:08:46] condition because of pride

[2:09:17] I'll do that
[2:09:20] oh no I don't have a
[2:09:22] husband Jesus said un her thou Hast well
[2:09:25] said I have no
[2:09:26] husband for thou Hast had five husbands
[2:09:29] and he whom thou now Hast is not thy
[2:09:32] husband and that said us thou
[2:09:34] truly and the woman said to him sir
[2:09:38] Hallelujah I
[2:09:41] perceive that thou art a
[2:09:46] prophet Hallelujah next
[2:09:49] verse our fathers worshiped in this
[2:09:52] mountain and you say that in Jerusalem
[2:09:55] is the place where men ought to
[2:09:58] worship and Jesus said unto her
[2:10:01] woman what is he
[2:10:04] requiring believe me Hallelujah if you
[2:10:08] knew the gift of
[2:10:10] God that was in your
[2:10:12] mxed I say un you woman I say un you
[2:10:16] Church believe me right the hour cometh
[2:10:20] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[2:10:23] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the
[2:10:26] father ye worship ye know not what we
[2:10:30] know what we worship for salvation is of
[2:10:32] the
[2:10:33] Jews but the hour cometh I like this
[2:10:37] right here but the hour cometh and now
[2:10:41] is stop looking for something far off to
[2:10:45] come he's already here he he has already
[2:10:49] come down Christ The Mighty Angel has
[2:10:53] come down he put one foot on the land
[2:10:56] one foot on the sea he took an open book
[2:10:59] and he called out your name I have needs
[2:11:03] to go by Samaria I have needs to go by
[2:11:05] bed for Texas woman if you knew who it
[2:11:08] was that was talking to you you had ask
[2:11:10] of me for a
[2:11:14] drink but the hour cometh and now is
[2:11:17] when the true
[2:11:19] worshipper shall worship the father in
[2:11:21] spirit and in truth for the father
[2:11:23] seeketh
[2:11:25] such
[2:11:27] yes oh
[2:11:29] my the father seeketh
[2:11:32] such I think I might know I know a
[2:11:36] little bit what the Lord might like want
[2:11:37] for
[2:11:39] Christmas he wants somebody to believe
[2:11:42] him for what he
[2:11:44] said and if you truly believe him right
[2:11:48] it becomes a
[2:11:50] revelation and that Revelation becomes a
[2:11:54] worship oh because he
[2:11:56] seeks those to worship Him in
[2:12:00] spirit and in
[2:12:03] truth oh my and now is when the true
[2:12:07] worshipper next
[2:12:10] verse God is a spirit and they that
[2:12:12] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[2:12:14] and in truth
[2:12:15] 25 the woman said to him I know that
[2:12:18] when Messiah
[2:12:19] cometh which is called Christ when he
[2:12:22] has come he will tell us these
[2:12:25] things I don't know if you've not been
