[10:38] your name.
[10:42] Hallelujah. Amen. I trust that you come
[10:44] to do this morning to forget about all
[10:47] of that happens throughout the week and
[10:49] to just come and glorify him to give him
[10:52] all the glory, all the honor this
[10:54] morning. Amen. Brother Tim Sal, if we
[10:56] could just come and open our service in
[10:57] prayer,
[11:06] determination this morning, the psalmist
[11:09] David said, "This is the day the Lord
[11:11] hath made. We will rejoice and be glad
[11:14] in it.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; And I had my version of that. I say, I'm
[11:18] determined to rejoice and be glad in it.
[11:21] Let's head. Gracious Lord, we thank you
[11:24] for the gathering this morning, Lord.
[11:26] We're able to lift up our voices in
[11:28] unison and say, "Praise be the name of
[11:30] the Lord." Lord, we welcome you in our
[11:33] midst. We know where you come, Lord, the
[11:36] supernatural,
[11:37] almighty, allsufficient heavenly father.
[11:41] Lord, there's nothing that would be out
[11:44] of your control, out of your doing,
[11:46] Lord. We pray that we can just yield to
[11:48] that spirit this morning, Lord. And may
[11:51] you just have preeminence in our midst
[11:54] this morning, Lord, as we sing the songs
[11:56] of praise and worship, Lord. May the
[11:58] just the effects of this sinful world
[12:01] just fall off of these cleaned up,
[12:04] sanctified bodies, Lord. May we enter
[12:07] into true fellowship and communion with
[12:10] our heavenly father. Lord, whatever
[12:12] needs we have, we just lay them at your
[12:15] altar this morning, Lord, knowing that
[12:17] you will answer each, Lord, as you see
[12:19] fit, Lord. But the persecutions, the
[12:22] trials, the troubles that come, Lord,
[12:25] they're for our benefit.
[12:28] David said,
[12:30] "He hath chasened me sore,
[12:33] but he hadn't given me over to death."
[12:36] We're thankful, Lord, that you have a
[12:38] means of preserving life in each one of
[12:40] us. Lord, even when these bodies fail,
[12:43] Lord, we look to to you that's within
[12:45] us. We lift up your name today, Lord.
[12:47] Ask that you just use us, Lord, as a
[12:51] body as you for your honor and glory as
[12:53] you see fit, Lord, and the ministry that
[12:55] comes forth, Lord. May he just be able
[12:57] to sense that the ground is prepared and
[13:00] ready for the word of God's seed that's
[13:02] going to fall in fertile ground this
[13:04] morning. Lord, we pray for those that
[13:06] couldn't be here, the sick, the needy,
[13:08] all things. Lord, we just commit them
[13:09] into your hands for your honor and
[13:10] glory. We ask all these things in the
[13:12] blessed name of our heavenly father, the
[13:14] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:18] Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[13:21] How many are happy to be gathered in the
[13:22] presence of the Lord this morning? Amen.
[13:25] I want to welcome everyone, all our
[13:27] visitors. God bless you, man. It's good
[13:29] to see Israel back there. God bless you.
[13:31] You could turn around and welcome
[13:32] someone this morning. Amen.
[13:47] Amen. Let's turn our Bible for a psalm
[13:50] reading this morning. Psalm 100. Amen. A
[13:53] very short psalm reading.
[13:57] I'll read the first and we'll join
[13:59] together.
[14:00] And the last amen.
[14:03] Psalm 100. It says, "Make a joyful noise
[14:06] unto the Lord, all ye lands.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Know ye that the Lord is is God. It is
[14:18] he that had made us and not ourselves.
[14:21] We are his people and the sheep of his
[14:24] pasture.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; For the Lord is good, his mercies is
[14:36] everlasting and his truth endureth to
[14:39] all generations. Hallelujah. God bless
[14:42] you. May have your seats.
[14:47] God's attributes were manifested
[14:51] through his inst

[15:04] up

[15:34] our sea.
[15:36] We are the word made fles
[15:42] and our names are sealed within and
[15:46] perfect.
[15:48] Oh yes we are. I don't
[15:54] by our God
[15:57] original
[16:07] word.
[16:09] It's what I believe.
[16:12] The son of man revealed what's ever seen
[16:18] original

[17:55] alive.

[18:46] time religion.

[18:54] He will save you when you're dying. He
[18:57] will start flying. Oh, it's good enough
[19:02] for me. Give it out.
[19:05] Time religion.

[19:28] up.
[19:30] Give it up. Old time relationship.
[20:04] Hallelujah.
[20:08] Amen. Invite brother Ben at this time to
[20:11] come and sing a special. Amen.
[20:56] She saints,
[21:01] &gt;&gt; you know the song, so just help me sing
[21:02] it. Once my heart
[21:06] was astray
[21:09] from that head
[21:12] finely way
[21:15] and was wretched
[21:18] and vow
[21:20] as could be.
[21:26] But my Savior
[21:29] above
[21:31] gave me peace,
[21:34] joy, and love
[21:37] when he reached
[21:39] down his hand
[21:42] for me.
[21:47] Oh, when he reached
[21:51] down his head
[21:53] for me.
[21:58] Oh, he had to reach
[22:02] way down
[22:04] for me.
[22:08] Oh,
[22:10] I was lost
[22:13] and undone
[22:15] without God. Oh, his son.
[22:21] when he reached
[22:24] down his hand
[22:27] for me
[22:32] and I was near
[22:35] rein
[22:38] when he came
[22:41] to me there
[22:44] and he showed me
[22:47] that I
[22:49] could be free.
[22:54] Oh, that he lifted
[22:58] my feet
[23:01] glory
[23:03] complete.
[23:05] Oh, when he reached
[23:08] down his hand
[23:11] for me.
[23:15] Oh, and he reached
[23:19] down his hand
[23:22] for
[23:23] me.
[23:26] Oh, I know he reached
[23:30] way down
[23:33] for me.
[23:37] Oh, I was lost
[23:41] and done
[23:44] without God. Oh, his son and he reached
[23:52] down his hand
[23:54] for me.
[23:59] Oh, how my heart
[24:03] does rejoice
[24:06] since I made
[24:08] him my choice.
[24:11] And from the tempest
[24:14] to heaven,
[24:16] now I free.
[24:21] Oh, now I need
[24:25] all this.
[24:28] I'm secure
[24:30] from all.
[24:32] Oh, he reached
[24:35] down his hand
[24:38] for me.
[24:42] Oh,
[24:44] and he reached
[24:47] down his hand
[24:49] for
[24:51] me.
[24:54] Oh, he had a reach
[24:58] way down
[25:01] for me.
[25:06] And I was lost
[25:09] and undone
[25:11] without your holy son.
[25:17] Oh, when he reaches
[25:20] down his hand.
[25:23] for me.
[25:27] Oh, says the Lord,
[25:31] gave me peace. Oh, heavenly joys, they
[25:36] never cease.
[25:39] And Lord, I give
[25:42] all my life
[25:45] unto thee.
[25:49] Oh God, my feet,
[25:53] oh my head, bread with thee that I may
[25:59] stand.
[26:01] Then he reached down his hand
[26:06] for me.
[26:10] Oh, when he reached
[26:14] down his hand
[26:17] for me,
[26:22] he had to reach
[26:25] way down
[26:28] for me.
[26:32] Oh, I will lost
[26:36] and undone
[26:39] without
[26:42] his son.
[26:45] When he reached
[26:47] down his hand
[26:50] for me,
[26:54] he said that I
[26:58] could still
[27:00] go free.
[27:05] Now tell me, what kind
[27:09] of a man
[27:12] would reach down
[27:14] his head? Oh, and do this for me.
[27:25] For me.
[27:27] Oh, I'm so
[27:30] oh unworthy
[27:33] to live. Oh, and I f
[27:47] my name in
[27:49] his will. He said that I
[27:54] I could still
[27:57] go free.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many can say this
[28:11] morning, I've been touched?
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're certainly thankful for
[28:17] that. We got a couple of requests we
[28:19] want to bring before the church at this
[28:21] time, man. Brother Stephen writes a
[28:23] testimony. It says, "I want to thank the
[28:25] Lord for uh my wife's birthday
[28:27] yesterday. I pray that God's presence be
[28:30] with her and the family always." Amen.
[28:33] Certainly thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[28:35] Also, brother uh uh David King writes,
[28:38] "I just want to thank the Lord for his
[28:40] victory over the sickness that that was
[28:43] bothering my sister Naomi. We certainly
[28:45] thank the Lord for his uh healing hands.
[28:48] Amen. They could certainly come and
[28:49] touch our sister. Amen.
[28:54] Uh Sister Abigail writes, "Uh God bless
[28:57] you all. I want to ask for prayer for my
[29:00] mom. She's a homesick with allergies
[29:02] that have been bothering her uh for over
[29:05] a week and uh she hasn't been able to
[29:07] properly breathe and asking for a
[29:09] healing touch in our bodies." Amen. We
[29:12] could certainly take it to the Lord and
[29:14] and know that it is a prayer answering
[29:16] God. Amen. Brother Emanuel has an
[29:18] unspoken request I'd like to be
[29:20] remembered for this morning. Want to
[29:22] take it before the Lord. Also from
[29:24] brother Steven again he writes uh uh
[29:27] praying for journey and the mercies as
[29:29] as I travel to South Africa on on
[29:32] Tuesday uh the 13th of January.
[29:35] Certainly want to uh keep our brother in
[29:37] prayer uh for traveling mercies. Amen.
[29:40] And brother Caleb writes, "God bless
[29:43] you, saints. Uh, the Kubaluca families
[29:45] are asking for prayers as Sister Jeannie
[29:48] was admitted to the hospital last night
[29:52] uh with signs of a stroke and the
[29:53] doctors uh noted the blood pressure
[29:56] spike and uh and it has gone down
[29:59] overnight. And once again, keep us in
[30:01] prayer." Amen. I believe we can
[30:03] certainly lift our sister up. I'll tell
[30:06] you this. But Bam says it's in the hour
[30:08] of need that Jesus comes.
[30:11] He He's never forsaken us. And there's
[30:14] nothing that we can ask that he hasn't
[30:16] already done. Amen. It's it's in our
[30:19] need that he's always there to answer
[30:21] and show that he's the same yesterday,
[30:23] today, and forever. So if you have a
[30:25] need upon your heart this morning, why
[30:27] don't you just lift your hand up to him
[30:28] and and say, "Father, this is my aisle
[30:31] of need and and I need you to come even
[30:33] right now and and touch and and answer
[30:36] to the request and and I believe we can
[30:38] lift our hands in faith all of us
[30:40] together as children that our father
[30:43] will hear." Amen. The brothers that are
[30:45] taking the offerings, brother Sergio, if
[30:47] you could just come and take this knees
[30:48] before the church. Amen.
[31:00] Let us pray.
[31:03] Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[31:06] everything you've done for us, Lord, for
[31:07] Calvary, Lord. Cuz we know that without
[31:11] that sacrifice, we would not be here,
[31:13] Lord. Father, every prayer request that
[31:17] has been made, Lord, Father, we put it
[31:20] before you, Lord. We place it before
[31:22] your throne of mercy and grace, Lord.
[31:24] And Father God, give healing to those
[31:28] that need healing, Lord. And Father God,
[31:30] help us to believe your word, Lord. Help
[31:33] us, Lord Jesus, to follow you and obey
[31:36] you, Lord. Father, I pray that you may
[31:41] bless the cheerful giver today, Lord.
[31:44] Father,
[31:46] bless every household in this place,
[31:48] Lord. Bless everyone, Lord, that needs a
[31:51] job. Lord, you are our supplier. Lord,
[31:54] you are Jehovah Gyra. Father God, that
[31:57] we may believe, Lord, with all of our
[31:59] heart, Lord, that you, Lord, bless the
[32:02] cheerful giver, Lord, that we may give
[32:05] with thanksgiving, Lord, knowing, Lord,
[32:07] that you you have plenty to give us,
[32:10] Lord. Father God, and your mercies are
[32:13] new every morning, Lord. Father, we
[32:16] thank you, Lord. Father, and we pray
[32:18] Lord that you give us grace and mercy to
[32:21] continue, Lord. We ask it in Jesus
[32:24] Christ's name. Amen.
[32:29] Oh, shackle
[32:32] by and he
[32:34] be burning.
[32:42] Lord of kings
[32:46] and shame.
[32:51] Oh, then the hand of Jesus
[32:57] touched me.
[33:01] And now I am no longer
[33:07] the same.
[33:12] Oh,

[33:26] the joy
[33:28] that my soul
[33:40] and Now
[33:43] I know
[33:45] he touched me
[33:49] and take
[33:51] me home.
[33:56] Oh,
[33:59] I bless
[34:04] you.
[34:17] Oh,
[34:19] and I shall never cease
[34:24] to praise him. Halleluah.
[34:28] Oh, and I shout
[34:32] it in one eternity.
[34:39] Oh, and he touched me.
[34:44] Oh,
[34:46] he touched me.
[34:51] And all
[34:55] the joy.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[35:13] glued
[35:19] once more. He touched me this morning.
[35:22] How many would like for him to touch
[35:23] you? Oh, he touched me.

[39:07] God bless you this morning.
[39:12] going to try to sing this song. Um,
[39:16] I don't know. It's just thank the Lord
[39:19] for his victory.
[39:30] I heard no
[39:34] ring.
[39:36] How the savior came
[39:38] from glory.
[39:41] How he gave his life on Calvary
[39:47] to save a rich like me.
[39:52] I heard about
[39:55] his groaning
[39:58] of his precious blood.
[40:01] I told
[40:03] then I repented
[40:06] of my sin
[40:09] and won the victory.
[40:14] Oh victory
[40:17] in Jesus
[40:20] my savior
[40:23] forever.
[40:25] He saw me
[40:28] and bought me
[40:31] with his redeeing
[40:34] power.
[40:36] He loved me.
[40:39] I knew him
[40:42] and all my love
[40:45] is doing.
[40:48] He plunged me
[40:50] to victory
[40:53] beneath the cleansing blood.
[40:59] I heard about
[41:01] his healing
[41:04] of his cleansing power
[41:07] revealing.
[41:10] How we made the lame
[41:12] to walk again
[41:15] and cause the blind to see.
[41:21] And then I cry,
[41:23] "Lord Jesus,
[41:26] come and heal my broken
[41:29] spirit."
[41:32] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[41:38] the f Victory.
[41:42] Oh, victory
[41:45] in Jesus
[41:48] my savior
[41:51] forever.
[41:54] He saw me
[41:56] and he bought me
[41:59] with his redeeing
[42:02] blood.
[42:05] He loved me here.
[42:08] I knew him
[42:11] all my life
[42:13] is through.
[42:16] He plunge me
[42:19] to victory
[42:22] if he's blessing.
[42:27] I heard about
[42:30] the manion
[42:33] he has built for me
[42:36] in glory.
[42:39] And I heard about
[42:41] the straits of gold
[42:44] beyond the crystal sea.
[42:50] While the angels
[42:53] singing
[42:55] and the old redemption
[42:59] story
[43:01] and some sweet they are sing
[43:06] the songs of victory.
[43:12] Oh, victory
[43:15] in Jesus
[43:18] my savior
[43:21] forever.
[43:24] He saw me
[43:26] and he bought me
[43:29] with his redeeing
[43:32] blood.
[43:35] He left me here.
[43:38] I knew me
[43:41] and all my love
[43:44] is to me.
[43:46] He launched me
[43:49] to victory
[43:52] beneath the cleansing flood. God bless
[43:57] you.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And aren't you glad he plunged you
[44:06] in his blood and made you whole? Amen.

[47:10] Lord, you're the great creator and maker
[47:14] of all things.
[47:17] Father, you made us just the way that
[47:19] you wanted us to be.
[47:24] You chose
[47:26] in your great plan to
[47:30] have a variety of people and
[47:33] natures and personalities that you could
[47:37] all mold and form into the image that
[47:41] you had in your mind. And Father, we ask
[47:44] that we would continue to be on your
[47:47] potter's wheel today.
[47:50] that you would form us and and deal with
[47:53] us and make us be what you'd have us to
[47:57] be. Father, we pray that you never take
[48:00] your hands off of us, but
[48:03] you just keep working towards that great
[48:05] perfection. We ask you to bless each
[48:08] heart here this morning. In Jesus
[48:10] precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. If
[48:14] you have your Bibles, let's turn over to
[48:16] uh
[48:19] the uh
[48:22] um
[48:23] see if I got my
[48:28] the
[48:30] gospel, the book of Second Kings in the
[48:34] Old Testament. And uh Second Kings is
[48:38] right after First Kings.
[48:41] I'm a Bible scholar.
[48:45] and uh and then it's just be after
[48:47] Judges and and Numbers and Exodus. So,
[48:50] it's kind of in the front of your
[48:52] Bibles.
[48:54] So,
[48:57] and we'd like just to read here and and
[48:59] have uh kind of just continue on the
[49:03] thought that we were ministering on uh
[49:06] last Sunday and uh just uh go down that
[49:11] line just a little bit again this
[49:14] morning. It said, "And then Moab
[49:16] rebelled against Israel after the death
[49:19] of Ahab,
[49:22] and Isaiah fell down through a lattice
[49:26] in his upper chamber, and was in
[49:30] Samaria, and was sick. And he sent
[49:33] messengers and said unto them, "Go
[49:36] inquire of Beelzebub, the god of Achor,
[49:42] whether I shall recover of this
[49:45] disease."
[49:47] But the angel of the Lord said unto
[49:50] Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise and go up to
[49:53] meet the messenger of the king of
[49:56] Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not
[50:00] because there is no God in Israel that
[50:05] ye go and inquire of Beelub,
[50:08] the God of Acar?
[50:12] Now therefore, thus saith the Lord, thou
[50:16] shalt not come down from that bed on
[50:21] which thou art gone up, but shall surely
[50:24] die. And Elijah departed. And when the
[50:28] messengers turned back unto him, he said
[50:33] unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
[50:37] And they said unto him, There came a man
[50:41] up to meet us, and said unto us, Go turn
[50:46] again unto the king that sent you, and
[50:50] say unto him, Thus sayeth the Lord, it
[50:54] is not because there is no God in
[50:56] Israel, that thou sent to inquire of
[50:59] Beelzeba, the God of Acorn. Therefore,
[51:03] thou shalt not come down from that bed
[51:07] on which thou hast gone up, but shall
[51:10] surely die. And he said unto them, What
[51:13] manner of man was he that came up to
[51:17] meet you? And told you these words? And
[51:21] they said unto him, he was a hairy man
[51:24] and girded with a girdle of leather
[51:26] about his loins. And he said it was
[51:29] Elijah the Tishbite. Our gracious
[51:33] father, we ask you to bless your word in
[51:35] your precious name. We pray you may be
[51:37] seated.
[51:44] My uh
[51:46] my my little thought this morning uh to
[51:50] us all because uh is uh called unused
[51:55] promises.
[51:57] unused promises. And uh I I just this
[52:02] message uh came on my heart where I got
[52:05] my inspiration from. If you'd like to go
[52:08] uh study it and read it, uh it was I
[52:12] believe it was preached in November of
[52:14] 1962
[52:16] and it was the message is called the way
[52:19] back.
[52:21] and uh and and so um we've been talking
[52:27] about uh uh character and uh uh the uh
[52:34] characteristics
[52:36] of something. And so we want to kind of
[52:39] just talk this morning about uh if we
[52:42] could do it maybe in a Bible study way
[52:45] and preach to you uh not so much of what
[52:49] our side of the effort is but having an
[52:54] understanding of what he's trying to do.
[52:58] You know I mean he the reason he created
[53:01] heaven and earth was to show his
[53:04] manifest himself. The invisible things
[53:08] of God are clearly seen in the visible
[53:12] things around us. So God being a spirit
[53:17] and uh not being whereas he could be
[53:21] handled or touched or known or seen uh
[53:27] uh and and being God, he was he was God
[53:30] alone. In fact, he really wasn't even
[53:33] God to begin with, if you could realize
[53:37] that because God's an object of worship.
[53:41] And so there was nobody to worship him
[53:43] and he created angels and and and yet uh
[53:48] uh he he wanted to display himself and
[53:52] make himself known and have fellowship
[53:56] and and so if when you can under
[54:00] understand that God is really the driver
[54:05] and the motivator of our lives if we're
[54:08] his
[54:09] &gt;&gt; the footsteps of the righteous are
[54:12] ordered by the Lord. Uh even Paul who
[54:16] God had in his mind to do a work for
[54:19] him. Uh he he was going about uh
[54:24] persecuting the church and and the Lord
[54:27] intervened because he had a great work
[54:29] for Paul to do. And he said, "Saul, you
[54:32] know, why why does it's hard for you to
[54:34] kick against a prick? You know, why do
[54:36] you persecute me?" And and I always
[54:39] thought I like that because Jesus took
[54:42] it personal.
[54:44] In other words, he was he was killing
[54:46] his followers and killing the ones that
[54:49] he believed. Jesus didn't say, "Oh,
[54:52] you're persecuting my saints. You're
[54:55] you're you're you're uh you know, you're
[54:58] you're destro destroying my legacy.
[55:01] You're uh interrupting my teaching." No,
[55:04] he said, "Why does thou persecute me?"
[55:07] In other words, this is this work that's
[55:11] going on of these men coming and
[55:14] recognizing me as the Messiah and
[55:17] receiving my spirit and being endued
[55:20] with power from on high and going about
[55:24] healing the sick and raising the dead
[55:26] and casting out demons and baptizing
[55:30] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:32] Christ. He said, "This isn't them. This
[55:34] is me. I'm the one doing the work. I'm
[55:37] the one that's manifesting myself. I'm
[55:40] the one that's on display. Uh this isn't
[55:44] them doing it. It's me doing it. And by
[55:47] you hurting them, you are hurting me.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; So why are you interrupting or
[55:53] persecuting or trying to put an end to
[55:57] the work that I am doing? and and and
[56:03] Satan, he wanted to come against that
[56:06] and and it I almost feel inspired right
[56:09] now to go through the the horse riders,
[56:11] you know, because that's what he did.
[56:13] Satan was wanted to interrupt that work
[56:16] from the beginning. And you know, and
[56:19] the best way to to deceive anything is
[56:23] to create a counterfeit. And that's what
[56:26] God uh Satan always does. He always has
[56:29] a counterfeit. He always has something
[56:32] else that he comes up with uh other than
[56:36] the way that God provided. So God has a
[56:41] provided way of doing things. He has a
[56:44] plan that he put in effect and he made
[56:47] that plan known in his word.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Well, he's got a little secret in there
[56:54] is that he's got to reveal to you to
[56:56] what that word says. He's the one that
[57:00] opens your eyes to it and gives you Isab
[57:04] and therefore he that heareth blessed is
[57:06] he that heareth the words of this book
[57:09] and and and and understandeth these
[57:12] things. So you're blessed to hear the
[57:15] gospel.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now other people don't think you're
[57:19] blessed.
[57:21] A lot of people think we have a bunch of
[57:23] rules. You know, they just think it's a
[57:25] shame that you have to have long hair,
[57:28] that you wear dresses, that you men
[57:30] don't smoke and drink. They just think
[57:32] that's just miserable. Oh, you you just
[57:35] they come, "Oh, you just got to be
[57:37] miserable, you know." Uh, a guy told me
[57:40] one time, he says, "Well, don't you
[57:42] cuss?"
[57:44] I said, "No, no, I don't cuss." He said,
[57:46] "Well, you know something? If you just
[57:47] curse a little bit, you'd feel a lot
[57:49] better."
[57:52] I thought, "Wait a minute. No, I I I'm
[57:56] happy not cursing.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; This isn't a burden to me. It's a joy.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; I used to curse.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I used to have a temper.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; I I used to, you know, beat things
[58:10] against the wall and and get so mad, you
[58:13] know, we used to say it. I so mad I
[58:15] could spit. You know what I mean? You
[58:17] just I I would get furious. And then the
[58:20] good things of God come by and I'm not
[58:23] going to lose my temper anymore and I'm
[58:25] not going to curse. And when I get all
[58:27] that frustration, something inside of me
[58:30] says, "This is temporary. It's not worth
[58:33] it. Uh there's something more to life
[58:36] than this." You know what I mean? I
[58:38] rejoice in that. I I I'm not that's not
[58:41] a burden to me.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; You know, thank God I I know his plan.
[58:48] Yeah,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; I I know what he is and I want to learn
[58:53] more of him and I want to understand him
[58:55] more and I want to become more like him
[58:59] and I I want to become more acquainted
[59:04] &gt;&gt; and if I could this is sort of the line
[59:07] I want to go down. I want to become more
[59:10] acquainted with the way that he does
[59:12] things.
[59:16] You know, we just think sometimes things
[59:18] are so uh uh uh uh terrible. I wonder
[59:22] how that uh the that father felt when
[59:26] his son took his inheritance and went
[59:29] out and squandered it all.
[59:32] You know, I mean, I'm sure he was hurt,
[59:35] but I'm sure he back in the his heart
[59:38] and in his prayers, he says, "This is my
[59:41] son. I dedicated him to you. He's your
[59:46] child. He was You gave him to me by
[59:49] promise and I believe you're going to
[59:51] bring him back.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And he waited patiently for the return
[59:56] of his son.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And when his son come back, he didn't
[1:00:00] treat him like a a servant. He didn't
[1:00:04] treat him no, he treated him like a son
[1:00:07] like what that he always was. But how
[1:00:10] would you like to go through that? You
[1:00:12] you know what I mean? I I'm blessed. You
[1:00:15] know, I have I have uh three boys that
[1:00:19] that uh preach the gospel.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And and I know at least two of them have
[1:00:25] spent time in the back of a police car,
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; you know, and in a lot of places that
[1:00:35] they shouldn't have been. But I I hang I
[1:00:39] hung on to something
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; and and that was that that he that he he
[1:00:46] would if you raised them in the way that
[1:00:48] they would go
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; that they would return
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; out to.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; So that was a promise.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And and and because I used that promise,
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; it got a resolve. Amen.
[1:01:08] So, and so we pick up this story here
[1:01:13] and and uh it and it it kind of kind of
[1:01:19] reminds me like he says he said um you
[1:01:23] know this this man got lost in the woods
[1:01:25] and I think brother Brandon, brother
[1:01:27] Jeff is up there hunting and he got lost
[1:01:30] and the guy came came to him and he was
[1:01:34] riding up there and the guy he he He he
[1:01:37] came up to him and he said he said uh he
[1:01:40] said to him he says how do you get out
[1:01:42] of here?
[1:01:44] So the guy's lost and he comes up on his
[1:01:46] horse. He says how do you get out of
[1:01:48] here? And the guy answered him back. He
[1:01:51] said well how did you get here?
[1:01:57] And he and and he said how he said he
[1:01:59] said well that way. He said well then
[1:02:02] that's the way out. So the way back
[1:02:04] again is just how you got here.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; And so if I can say it this way, you
[1:02:10] know, sometimes if if that sometimes
[1:02:13] when we we get lost or we get into a
[1:02:16] place, we want to know the way back.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? H how do I get
[1:02:22] here? And what's my way back? Uh
[1:02:27] and because if you reject the way back,
[1:02:30] you reject the way forward.
[1:02:33] If you're lost, you have to go back to
[1:02:36] where you were. You've got to go back to
[1:02:39] an identifiable reference point that
[1:02:42] gets you going in the right direction.
[1:02:45] When you get lost in life and you don't
[1:02:48] you don't know what you're doing. It it
[1:02:50] it's very easy to do to get in a routine
[1:02:53] and you're working and you're laboring
[1:02:55] and you're going on and and and all of a
[1:02:58] sudden you get these feelings on you.
[1:03:00] What is what is what what is all this
[1:03:02] about? And what am I doing? And and
[1:03:05] what's my future hold? And and I it just
[1:03:08] seems like I'm spinning my wheels and
[1:03:11] the weight of of life just gets down to
[1:03:14] you. How did this happen to me? How did
[1:03:15] I get in this rut? And and you get in a
[1:03:19] rut that and you find you're you're kind
[1:03:22] of drifting and you're kind of lost and
[1:03:25] and and maybe you've made some mistakes.
[1:03:28] Uh, I'm go glad that my God's greater
[1:03:31] than my mistakes.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? But there's
[1:03:34] something inside of you that says you I
[1:03:36] how do I get back? How do I get back to
[1:03:39] that place of joy? I I'm backslid. I'm
[1:03:42] not reading my Bible. I'm not praying
[1:03:45] the way I used to. I don't feel the
[1:03:47] sensitivity of the spirit. I don't have
[1:03:50] any leadership. I don't have any
[1:03:52] uncction. I feel powerless. I I I I
[1:03:56] don't feel like I'm being led to do
[1:03:59] anything. And we we we our our life
[1:04:02] seems to close in on us and we feel
[1:04:05] collapsed and and and our joy begins to
[1:04:08] leak out. Uh like a leaky sister, you
[1:04:12] know what I mean? We we we're not
[1:04:13] holding uh we're not holding the joy of
[1:04:16] the Lord. We're not holding the peace of
[1:04:18] the Lord. Uh those things. And and so
[1:04:21] there's some desire in our heart that we
[1:04:24] want to get back.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to get back. And
[1:04:30] that's why we call it being backslid.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; You You understand? And we want to get
[1:04:36] upslid. You know what I mean? We we we
[1:04:39] want to we want to go back up the slide.
[1:04:42] We want to climb the ladder. You know,
[1:04:45] and and so that that's our that that's
[1:04:48] what our goal is. We got to know that
[1:04:50] that there's an enemy, but there's got
[1:04:52] to there's a way back
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; for for the believer
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; and there's a way back into the presence
[1:05:02] of the Lord. There's a way back into the
[1:05:05] joy of the Lord. There's a way back
[1:05:08] where the pressures of this life and and
[1:05:12] th those things mean a whole lot. You
[1:05:15] know, uh it's like putting money in the
[1:05:17] savings account. you think you got a
[1:05:19] little bit of money in the savings
[1:05:21] account and and you feel uh pretty good.
[1:05:24] We used to say I got a little jingle in
[1:05:27] my pocket, you know, and if you had a
[1:05:29] little jingle in your pocket, man, you
[1:05:31] felt pretty good, you know. I used to
[1:05:33] keep a dollar bill, $1 bill, so I would
[1:05:36] never die broke.
[1:05:39] You know, I just, you know, if I die
[1:05:41] today or I get in a wreck, at least I'm
[1:05:43] not going to die broke. Well, I got a
[1:05:46] father
[1:05:48] that owns the cattle on a thousand hill
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; and he promised
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I want to set that word again then he
[1:05:58] promised
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; that the righteous would not bake bread
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; and then my sermon goes so we're we're
[1:06:05] looking at we're we're just looking at
[1:06:07] this story and I took some inspiration
[1:06:09] from this story so if you want to go
[1:06:13] back and listen to it it's 11:23
[1:06:16] um 1962
[1:06:18] Shreport series called the way back and
[1:06:21] and brother B says this this morning. He
[1:06:24] says and the story started off this is
[1:06:27] paragraph 10 of that message. It says
[1:06:30] that the our story starts off tonight
[1:06:32] with the people that had that had like
[1:06:36] last night had got away from God.
[1:06:41] So, we know that Ahab got away from God
[1:06:46] and now his son takes the throne and
[1:06:48] he's away from God. And when we find
[1:06:52] ourselves away from God, we want to know
[1:06:55] a way back. Now, Satan will tell you
[1:06:58] there is no way back, but there is a way
[1:07:02] back.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And and so they they they they
[1:07:07] had they had got away from God. And that
[1:07:10] is the most miserable thing that I can
[1:07:13] think of is someone a believer away from
[1:07:17] God.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; How many have ever I've I been away from
[1:07:24] God and it's miserable.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; It's miserable. you feel miserable,
[1:07:32] you know, and and regret
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; just comes flooding in because you can't
[1:07:38] undo what you did and it's just setting
[1:07:42] on your mind uh like a ton of bricks and
[1:07:47] you're dragging it behind you and and
[1:07:51] maybe the burden leaves you for a few
[1:07:54] days or so, but then you come back along
[1:07:57] and there it seems like you're dragging
[1:07:59] your past,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; you know, and and yet there's there's
[1:08:03] promises for that,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; you know, leave those things which are
[1:08:07] behind behind and press for a higher
[1:08:10] calling.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; And and so uh the Samaria and and those
[1:08:17] people uh they they they got away from
[1:08:20] God. And we find out that this king of
[1:08:22] Samaria,
[1:08:24] Isaiah, the reason that he was away from
[1:08:27] God is because he had the wrong kind of
[1:08:30] tutoring, the wrong kind of raising.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And so we we we find out sometimes that
[1:08:38] our problems are the things that and
[1:08:42] teachings and ideas we have in our life
[1:08:46] that aren't from God.
[1:08:49] That's right.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Their their attitudes,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; their their reaction
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; that maybe we've seen our parents do.
[1:08:59] Maybe we've seen the kids at school do.
[1:09:02] I I I've talked to hundreds of parents
[1:09:05] who who come and and they're devastated
[1:09:08] because their kid come home from school
[1:09:11] saying things.
[1:09:15] You know, I sat in my office. I don't
[1:09:18] think that person's here. If you are,
[1:09:19] forgive me because I don't remember who
[1:09:21] you were. But I remember the situation.
[1:09:24] They came in my office. I said, "My
[1:09:27] six-year-old came home today from school
[1:09:30] and announced to me that they're gay."
[1:09:36] And I said,
[1:09:39] "And and they're they're like I said,
[1:09:41] they don't even know what they're
[1:09:42] saying.
[1:09:47] But there there you understand. So, but
[1:09:51] that all this stuff takes them in away.
[1:09:54] Let me tell you, parents, know what
[1:09:57] they're teaching your children.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; If you have your children in sports,
[1:10:04] know the coach, know the attitude, know
[1:10:07] the parents, know the spirit that's on
[1:10:09] the team. uh you you know can know what
[1:10:13] the the uh uh atmosphere that's being
[1:10:18] created. See, these are things that
[1:10:21] we've got away from,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; you know, that that we we've we've
[1:10:27] dropped our responsibility
[1:10:30] on the atmosphere that we have in our
[1:10:33] home, the atmosphere that we have around
[1:10:35] our children, what it is that we're
[1:10:38] we're uh putting out as being important.
[1:10:43] If you have children and you're always
[1:10:45] talking and they always hear you worried
[1:10:47] about the bills, worried about the
[1:10:49] future, worried about this, worried
[1:10:52] about that, you know what that is to
[1:10:54] them? That's life.
[1:11:04] You know, could you imagine just saying,
[1:11:06] "Well, praise God." You know, if all
[1:11:08] they heard is, "Praise God." You know,
[1:11:11] I'm glad my father owns the cattle on a
[1:11:13] thousand hills. Hallelujah. I God will
[1:11:16] take care of us. You know, oh, I I woke
[1:11:19] up this morning not feeling too well,
[1:11:21] but thank God God's a healer. But that
[1:11:23] you understand now the way that they've
[1:11:25] been taught in the way they should go.
[1:11:28] And that's why the scripture says,
[1:11:30] "Raise a child in the way it should go."
[1:11:33] So you're you're just, you know, you've
[1:11:37] got to take the responsibility
[1:11:39] of knowing what direction are they're
[1:11:43] going and what are the questions that
[1:11:46] are on their heart and mind.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; And that's say to all our young people,
[1:11:52] I don't care if you're seven, six,
[1:11:54] eight, nine, 10, if you have a question
[1:11:57] about the word of God, I'm always
[1:12:00] available.
[1:12:04] because we want to go in the right
[1:12:06] direction. If we're not in the right
[1:12:07] direction, then how do we get back?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; You know, how do we how do we back
[1:12:15] instill the enthusiasm for the gospel,
[1:12:19] the enthusiasm for being in church on
[1:12:22] time, the enthusiasm for bearing the
[1:12:24] burdens of one another, the enthusiasm.
[1:12:27] It doesn't matter if the economy falls
[1:12:30] apart.
[1:12:33] I I would rather be
[1:12:36] financially bankrupt than spiritually
[1:12:38] bankrupt.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; I I you know I I would rather have the
[1:12:46] faith
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; you know you know to take a stone and
[1:12:49] turn it into a loaf of bread than have
[1:12:53] all the money to buy all the bread in
[1:12:55] the world.
[1:12:58] But but we we GOT TO GET BACK TO that
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; back to God first. Back to the power of
[1:13:05] God. Back to the MERCY OF GOD. BACK TO
[1:13:08] the joy of the Lord.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; And if we're not there, it it's not
[1:13:12] condemnation. It's how do we get back?
[1:13:20] And so he said they that he said because
[1:13:23] they didn't have the right kind of
[1:13:24] raising.
[1:13:26] His mother was a heathen. His father was
[1:13:29] a backsliden Israelite Ahab. And through
[1:13:33] there he hadn't had very much bringing
[1:13:38] up in the way of the Lord
[1:13:42] through by the thought by the people. So
[1:13:46] he he didn't he wasn't brought up in the
[1:13:48] way of the Lord.
[1:13:51] You can take that down now. Thank you.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; You know, deliverance is a great thing.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I I I believe in deliverance. It's a
[1:14:06] good thing. But you know I but I think
[1:14:10] better than deliverance is is is not to
[1:14:14] get in trouble in the first place.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You know deliverance become becomes a
[1:14:23] crutch.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; You know and we always offer
[1:14:29] deliverance. There's a a lot of
[1:14:31] deliverance ministry in in the land
[1:14:34] today. uh got a lot of you know you're
[1:14:37] in trouble or you're you know you're
[1:14:39] you're this is going on this is going on
[1:14:42] that's going on here God's a deliverer
[1:14:45] he'll come and deliver you he's a he's a
[1:14:48] a mighty deliverer and and and people
[1:14:51] run and they come for deliverance
[1:14:55] because they want deliverance
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; but what's better than deliverance
[1:15:01] is to be raised in the way to go that
[1:15:04] you Don't get in trouble.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; That That's the the better way.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Experience is a teacher, but it's not
[1:15:17] the best teacher. Instruction is the
[1:15:20] best teacher. Obedience is the best
[1:15:24] weapon.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; It's not crash, burn, and be resurrected
[1:15:28] again. You know, if I ever come to this
[1:15:31] altar and I pray for a deliverance from
[1:15:34] whatever, whether it's
[1:15:36] movie, whatever it is, you guys have
[1:15:39] heard the list a million times from
[1:15:41] everybody that preaches, all the people
[1:15:43] come find, but I'd like to get up and
[1:15:45] say, "Okay, God just delivered me from
[1:15:48] this. HOW DO I NOT GO BACK?
[1:15:57] What's my way forward?
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of repeating this.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; I like Aaron preached one time. I
[1:16:05] thought it was a pretty good sermon.
[1:16:06] He's called Breaking the Cycle.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; You know, this is what I want to know.
[1:16:15] And so we find out that that that we we
[1:16:20] recognize that uh
[1:16:24] that he uh
[1:16:28] that we want to we want to start finding
[1:16:30] out
[1:16:32] how is it that we go forward. And that's
[1:16:36] why I preached last Sunday that
[1:16:39] character
[1:16:40] is the deliverance.
[1:16:45] Not the act of being set free.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; A guy can step out of prison.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; The shackles are off,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; but if he runs with the wrong crowd
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; and it's hard
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; because all what he knew was what put
[1:17:04] him there.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; And when he comes out, that's still all
[1:17:09] that he knows.
[1:17:13] And if not, if he starts running with
[1:17:16] the same and doing the same and and
[1:17:19] doing the same things, he'll he'll go
[1:17:21] right back.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; But if he has the character
[1:17:26] to say, "I ain't going to be back in
[1:17:29] that place again.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to run with these people.
[1:17:34] I'm not going to take that. I'm not
[1:17:35] going to do that. I'm going to work
[1:17:37] hard." that that that isn't the things
[1:17:41] that the actions are not what delivers
[1:17:44] him. It's the character that's inside
[1:17:48] him. The characteristics
[1:17:50] of the decisions that he's made and the
[1:17:53] stance that he takes that's going to be
[1:17:55] his deliverance.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; He wasn't delivered when the key was
[1:18:01] opened and the cell came open and he
[1:18:05] came out no longer in bondage. His
[1:18:08] deliverance was the character that he
[1:18:11] has
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; to overcome
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; and it's given to the overcomer.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Not the guy who's got the most
[1:18:24] deliverance
[1:18:26] stacked up.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Look at me. I've been delivered 150
[1:18:32] times
[1:18:34] by the Lord.
[1:18:37] But give me one deliverance and the
[1:18:40] character of Jesus Christ and I won't be
[1:18:43] back there.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I want that to sink deep.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:18:55] he says, I think that's the matter
[1:18:56] today, that most popular route. And when
[1:19:01] God makes a way, the people get away
[1:19:04] from him. And God makes a way for the
[1:19:07] people to return back to him.
[1:19:11] And the people refuse to do it. Then God
[1:19:14] asks, "Why?"
[1:19:17] He always asks, "Why didn't you do it?"
[1:19:22] And so we find out that this is our
[1:19:24] story that there there's a prophet in
[1:19:27] the land.
[1:19:29] And this king
[1:19:32] goes and inquires of be elabub.
[1:19:39] Will I be in this bed or not? And the
[1:19:43] Lord speaks to Elijah because the Lord
[1:19:46] had the plan.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; The Lord was the one who knew.
[1:19:53] you know, it isn't uh it it isn't this
[1:19:57] little uh you know, this little voice in
[1:20:02] this thing.
[1:20:05] You ought to Google, how do I get to
[1:20:06] heaven?
[1:20:10] How do I make the rapture?
[1:20:14] What is the voice of God
[1:20:17] in this generation?
[1:20:21] Do you think they got the answers?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Why do you inquire?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you why do you go this way?
[1:20:34] Why do you use these things? Uh uh
[1:20:39] you know,
[1:20:41] why do you do some some something else?
[1:20:45] You you know what I mean? Why do you go
[1:20:47] to some other source?
[1:20:51] Why? WHY DO YOU FIND some other method
[1:20:54] of deliverance, some other method of of
[1:20:58] finance? I you know, I've had people
[1:21:00] come and say, you know, I just can't get
[1:21:02] ahead. I asked I said, "Do you have you
[1:21:03] pay your tithes?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; No, I pay my bills
[1:21:10] and then what I have left over, I give
[1:21:12] some to God."
[1:21:15] You think, oh, you know, and you say,
[1:21:17] well, you know, why don't you why don't
[1:21:20] you reverse that program?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; And you know me, I'm not preaching
[1:21:26] tithing this morning or offering or
[1:21:28] anything. You have an experience with
[1:21:30] the Lord, it you you'll want to do it
[1:21:32] automatically.
[1:21:34] But
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; but it's it's trying something else.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:21:44] people that wanted to, you know, I like
[1:21:46] to catch fish. I got so many fishing
[1:21:49] lures that you It's ridiculous.
[1:21:53] Why? Because every time I get in there,
[1:21:55] I want to try something else.
[1:22:00] Well, I don't care what you're trying.
[1:22:02] If the fish don't bite, they're not
[1:22:05] biting. How about looking out and seeing
[1:22:07] if the cattle are feeding and the birds
[1:22:09] are feeding? They said, "Now I'll go
[1:22:11] fishing because they're fishing." But
[1:22:14] no, man wants to use science.
[1:22:16] They want to use technology. They want
[1:22:19] to use every they want to use some other
[1:22:21] provided way. I'm using fishing because
[1:22:24] I want you to see that it even in the
[1:22:27] carnal realm,
[1:22:31] we we we we want to fix carnal things
[1:22:35] with carnal things.
[1:22:39] And carnal plus carnal equals
[1:22:43] carnal.
[1:22:47] And this is what this king did is that
[1:22:50] he he wanted he wanted to try to try
[1:22:54] something else.
[1:22:56] He he wasn't going to go to what God
[1:22:58] provided. He's going to try something
[1:23:01] else. He's going to try some other
[1:23:03] method, some other thing. And when and
[1:23:06] this is what I'm trying to point out.
[1:23:07] There's a book full of promises.
[1:23:11] And the promises of God unused.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; We don't use the promise.
[1:23:22] Maybe because we don't know what the
[1:23:24] promise is. I I just printed out a
[1:23:28] hundred verses about deliverance.
[1:23:32] And then there's another hundred about
[1:23:34] trust. And there's another hundred about
[1:23:37] this. And I went there and there's all
[1:23:39] these different categories with Bible
[1:23:41] verses. AND I SAID, "THERE'S A BIBLE
[1:23:43] VERSE FOR EVERYTHING."
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; God's got a promise for everything.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; He's got a word for everything. He has a
[1:23:53] method for everything.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You don't need the mana of man. We need
[1:23:58] the mana of God.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE NEED. THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:24:06] PROVIDED
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; IN THIS GREATEST BATTLE THAT WAS EVER
[1:24:10] FOUGHT. The battle in our mind and the
[1:24:12] battle in our life and the battle OF
[1:24:14] FLESH. IF GOD COULD HAVE GIVEN US
[1:24:16] ANYTHING BETTER than his word, he would
[1:24:19] have done it.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; But what did HE GIVE US? HE GAVE US
[1:24:24] PROMISES.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; It's what he gave us.
[1:24:32] And they go unused.
[1:24:37] The promises aren't even considered.
[1:24:41] They're not even searched out.
[1:24:45] Have you ever seen those little promise
[1:24:47] boxes?
[1:24:49] Pull a promise out every day and you
[1:24:51] read it.
[1:24:54] Just think
[1:24:56] how many days
[1:24:59] I don't even want to look back but how
[1:25:02] many days have I started a day without a
[1:25:04] promise.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Without knowing what the future of my
[1:25:11] day was according to the word of God.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Let me say that again. the future of my
[1:25:20] day according to the promised word of
[1:25:24] God.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; I'd like to step out in the morning say,
[1:25:30] "I am the Lord thy God that deliverth
[1:25:33] thee from all thy diseases. I can rely
[1:25:35] on that promise.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I will keep you.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Nothing will pluck you out of the palm
[1:25:44] of my hand." I was starting that day,
[1:25:46] LORD. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF FOWLS AND
[1:25:48] BIRDS of the air that are trying to
[1:25:50] pluck me up and destroy me. The people
[1:25:53] at work hate me. THEY'RE SETTING TRAPS
[1:25:55] FOR ME. THEY'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS
[1:25:57] FOR ME. BUT I'M NOT LOOKING AT THAT. I'm
[1:26:00] going to rely on the promised word of
[1:26:04] God. And yet the promises of God unused.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; There's a whole stack of them.
[1:26:16] I like these guys that have a whole box
[1:26:18] full of end wrenches and yet they'll get
[1:26:20] a pair of vice grips to turn that bolt
[1:26:22] every time.
[1:26:26] And after four or five times,
[1:26:30] you can't even put an end wrench on it
[1:26:33] no more.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; And it's so warped and through and
[1:26:36] chewed up that it's almost becomes
[1:26:39] worthless.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You keep putting the wrong thing
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; on something.
[1:26:46] You'll get it so warped and so mixed up
[1:26:49] in your mind that you won't even be able
[1:26:52] to discern it
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; anymore.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; It'll become so deformed you won't even
[1:26:59] be able to tell what it is.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; And that's how
[1:27:05] uh Isaiah got and and Ahab got.
[1:27:10] They got so far away from God that there
[1:27:13] was a a way back
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; right there in their midst
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; and they couldn't recognize it.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And it was the same thing was in our
[1:27:24] generation. The the church, the
[1:27:26] Christian church got totally away from
[1:27:29] God. They were going in the wrong
[1:27:31] direction. They were counting numbers.
[1:27:33] They were counting growth. They were
[1:27:36] counting the move of the spirit. They
[1:27:38] were counting their fellowship amongst
[1:27:40] one another. How that they felt. They no
[1:27:43] longer cared for the mind of God. They
[1:27:45] no longer cared for the promises of God.
[1:27:48] They no longer cared for the word of
[1:27:50] God. THEY WERE TOTALLY VOID. AND GOD
[1:27:52] SENT THEM A prophet
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; to bring them back.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; I WILL RESTORE SAITH THE LORD.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; AND IF THEY WOULD ASK, HOW DID WE GET
[1:28:06] HERE?
[1:28:08] HE SAID, "LOOK AT THE WAY YOU CAME.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; They quit. They started eliminating
[1:28:17] promises.
[1:28:21] They picked some, but they didn't pick
[1:28:23] others.
[1:28:25] They started wanting to preach a
[1:28:27] feel-good gospel.
[1:28:31] They had every other reason in the world
[1:28:33] for what they were doing. They lost the
[1:28:36] motivation of what does he feel about
[1:28:39] this?
[1:28:40] What is the will of the Lord? What does
[1:28:43] the Lord think about this? What does the
[1:28:45] word of God say about this? How should I
[1:28:48] address this?
[1:28:50] I'm going to knock until I found an
[1:28:53] answer. I'm going to seek till I find.
[1:28:56] I'm going to lay before the Lord. You
[1:28:58] know what the trouble nowadays? It's
[1:29:00] pressure.
[1:29:02] Everybody wants a instant decision.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; They want to microwave everything. They
[1:29:07] want to take this Bible, stick it in the
[1:29:10] microwave for 5 seconds, get it PULLED
[1:29:12] OUT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE WORD SAYS.
[1:29:14] IT SAYS, "THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; shall mount up with wings of the eagle."
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; You can't Google the Bible.
[1:29:29] You can't Google the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; You can't go seek some other way of
[1:29:37] doing things.
[1:29:48] with something that that he can that
[1:29:51] that uh you know that that he can
[1:29:55] fulfill his own way.
[1:30:00] And this is why the promises of God
[1:30:04] are are are are so important.
[1:30:08] You and I I just want to to say that
[1:30:13] to you. Uh
[1:30:16] it they're they're so important.
[1:30:22] You know, people I like what brother Ben
[1:30:24] says in here. I I won't give that that,
[1:30:26] but I'll just tell you what he said. He
[1:30:28] said, "Man was always trying to come up
[1:30:31] with slogans,
[1:30:34] you know, some move,
[1:30:37] some rally,
[1:30:40] you know, some thing to to create the
[1:30:44] revival." Let me tell you, the revival
[1:30:47] is individual.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; It's in your heart.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; You have to want to get back.
[1:30:55] You have got to work to get back to God.
[1:30:58] You have got to want to be healed. You
[1:31:01] have got to want to be delivered. You
[1:31:04] you know you it's it isn't a conviction
[1:31:07] that's put on you in the moment and then
[1:31:10] you feel the pressure and you run
[1:31:13] because I don't want to feel conviction.
[1:31:15] Most people want deliverance from
[1:31:17] CONVICTION BUT THEY DON'T WANT THE
[1:31:20] CHARACTER THAT KEEPS THEM FROM GETTING
[1:31:22] THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:31:30] And that character
[1:31:34] lies in
[1:31:36] the promises
[1:31:38] of God.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; I like what he says. He says here, he
[1:31:47] says they want to come back in their own
[1:31:51] way of thinking.
[1:31:56] I'll just read the whole way. He says
[1:31:59] God had a way for him to know it, but he
[1:32:03] didn't want to take that way. He took
[1:32:05] the most popular way there was among the
[1:32:08] people. I hate to say this, but that's
[1:32:12] always seems slogans America back to
[1:32:16] God, back to God hour and things like
[1:32:20] that. But the thing of it is they want
[1:32:23] to come back the way that man had
[1:32:27] achieved for them to come back
[1:32:33] and they want to come back on their own
[1:32:35] way of thinking their own way of doing
[1:32:38] and usually it's contrary to God's way
[1:32:42] of returning.
[1:32:45] God had a way for him to get well.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; That would have been call Elijah the
[1:32:52] Tishbite.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Elijah the Tishbite would have come,
[1:32:56] told him the word of the Lord, told him
[1:32:58] to get rid of his idols, told him to
[1:33:01] apply the the the token to Israel, told
[1:33:05] him to re get back to offering the
[1:33:08] sacrifices to get back to dressing
[1:33:10] right, acting right, living right. He
[1:33:13] would HAVE TOLD HIM GOD'S WAY BACK AND
[1:33:15] HE WOULD HAVE GOT BACK.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WENT and inquired
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; of another way.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; And there we don't inquire of the
[1:33:31] promises.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; THE PROMISES go unused.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; There's a mountain full of them. There's
[1:33:41] enough scripture
[1:33:43] for everything,
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; but it's not used.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; It's like we said, it's acknowledged.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; It's identified.
[1:33:57] It's like putting on the jersey
[1:34:00] from the team.
[1:34:03] You know, I'm going to put on a a hockey
[1:34:06] jersey
[1:34:08] and I'm going to walk into the mall with
[1:34:10] a hockey jersey. You think everybody's
[1:34:11] going to Oh, there goes a hockey player.
[1:34:16] In my mind,
[1:34:18] if I was to wear a jersey, I should wear
[1:34:20] a Penguin jersey.
[1:34:23] Then they can say, "There goes a
[1:34:24] penguin."
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It's not association.
[1:34:36] Deliverance is in character.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; It's not association
[1:34:43] but it relies in in greater than
[1:34:45] association.
[1:34:47] He says
[1:34:49] their own way of thinking.
[1:34:52] And then when they returned down when
[1:34:54] they turned down God's provided way for
[1:34:57] them to return, God asked them, "Why?
[1:35:00] Why did you do it that way?" That's a
[1:35:03] good QUESTION TO ASK OURSELVES. WHY DID
[1:35:06] I DO IT THAT WAY?
[1:35:09] Why did I gossip instead of going to the
[1:35:12] person myself?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Why did I have that bad feeling?
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Why was I jealous?
[1:35:25] We don't ask.
[1:35:27] Brother B preached a lot of sermons. Um,
[1:35:30] why?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Because if we're not careful, we don't
[1:35:34] even use our mind. Our minds are being
[1:35:38] used, but we're not using our mind.
[1:35:43] I remember one of my boys told me one
[1:35:45] time, he said, "Dad, turn off your
[1:35:47] computer because if you don't, they'll
[1:35:48] use it."
[1:35:50] I thought,
[1:35:52] "You're crazy.
[1:35:55] How are they going to use my computer?"
[1:35:59] And they tried to explain to me how it's
[1:36:01] hooked up and I got an IP address and
[1:36:03] blah blah blah. And man, they took me
[1:36:06] off of this earth into space and alls I
[1:36:09] wanted to do is get back here as quick
[1:36:10] as I could.
[1:36:17] I asked my phone one time, "How do I get
[1:36:18] to such and such place?" I know it's
[1:36:22] auto parts store car. Next 20 minutes, I
[1:36:25] have 15 auto part store commercials.
[1:36:32] It's voodoo.
[1:36:39] AI. That's exactly what we're all going
[1:36:41] to get. We're all going to have
[1:36:43] artificial intelligence instead of the
[1:36:45] intelligence of God's word. God's word
[1:36:48] is the most intelligent thing that there
[1:36:52] is.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; God's word works.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; It'll never fail. It's been designed
[1:36:59] from the beginning to the end. It was
[1:37:02] designed TO GET US THROUGH THIS AGE. It
[1:37:04] was designed TO GET US THROUGH EVERY
[1:37:06] AGE. IT'S DESIGNED TO GET US THROUGH THE
[1:37:08] SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. IT'S
[1:37:12] GOD'S WORD AND IT WILL NOT FAIL.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; But use everything else.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You know what? I can put every
[1:37:29] artificial intelligence in one
[1:37:32] scripture.
[1:37:33] Surely you will not die.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Where did it come from? I know where it
[1:37:44] came from.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Unlike Al Gore who thinks he invented
[1:37:49] the internet,
[1:37:54] I know where the internet come from.
[1:37:58] I know how it got here
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; and I know who's running it
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; come from the beast
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; in the midst of the garden
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; who offered Eve
[1:38:17] another way to serve God. Do you know
[1:38:20] that Eve believed Satan's lie as God's
[1:38:23] truth?
[1:38:26] She thought she could serve God better,
[1:38:28] be more like God,
[1:38:32] but God's way was obey what I said.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; I'll provide the rest.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; I'll take care of you.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; I'll lead you. I'll guide you. I'll
[1:38:43] speak to you. I'll direct you. I'll
[1:38:45] convict you. I'll give you uncction. If
[1:38:47] you start down the wrong path, you'll
[1:38:50] feel my presence. Say, "No.
[1:38:55] that you're in the hand of God and
[1:38:58] nothing will pluck you out of there.
[1:39:01] That's a promise.
[1:39:05] And so he says, he said, he says like we
[1:39:09] call a time
[1:39:11] uh we used to be the president would
[1:39:14] say, well, we'll call 15 minutes of
[1:39:17] prayer.
[1:39:18] All the machinery stopped.
[1:39:21] They'll never do it. It's got to take a
[1:39:24] breaking up. It's got to take a dying
[1:39:28] out. It's got to take a regeneration.
[1:39:32] I It It don't take an hour of prayer. It
[1:39:35] takes until you come back.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; But you got to want to go back.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; You want to get you want to have to get
[1:39:47] back TO THE SPIRIT. YOU CAN'T KEEP
[1:39:50] having the church, the ministry, the
[1:39:54] everybody that we all do our best to
[1:39:56] ministers. I'm all with them. BUT YOU
[1:39:58] JUST CAN'T HAVE THEM KEEP PROVIDING you
[1:40:02] uh power drinks.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You know, ANOTHER LITTLE TIDBIT,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER LITTLE SOMETHING TO GET YOU
[1:40:15] MOTIVATED.
[1:40:19] I guess they got programs
[1:40:21] today.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; I don't told me what one a CPT t chat or
[1:40:31] another guy says, "No, I use mine's
[1:40:33] better." And and so they pulled a trick
[1:40:35] on sister Leslie. We're talking about
[1:40:37] doing a little remodeling on the
[1:40:38] platform, make it a little bigger and
[1:40:40] and everything. So, Matthew talks to his
[1:40:42] phone and blah blah blah and kind of
[1:40:45] draws it up the way he want. And he
[1:40:46] takes a picture home to Leslie and says,
[1:40:49] "Look what we did, mom."
[1:40:52] And she's seeing the picture. And not
[1:40:55] only that, Davey's in the picture.
[1:40:58] She said, "How did YOU GUYS DO THAT SO
[1:41:00] FAST?" And they said, "Oh, we had all
[1:41:03] the stuff right at church.
[1:41:08] We're being duped." Amen.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; All the time.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And we're totally unconscious of it.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; We We don't filter nothing back through
[1:41:16] the word of God. We don't find out, is
[1:41:19] there a promise of God for where I'm at
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; and what I'm going through?
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Is there a promise God for my
[1:41:32] automobile? Is there a promise of God
[1:41:35] for my job? IS THERE A PROMISE OF God
[1:41:37] for my feelings the way that I am? Is
[1:41:40] there A PROMISE? IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
[1:41:43] GOD SAID HE WOULD DO?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SAYS HE'LL DO IT, HE'LL DO IT
[1:41:49] EVERY TIME.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; But it's not even considered no more.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; It's way down on the list
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; of the book of wisdoms. Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; I can solve every single
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; scientific
[1:42:16] problem right here.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; It's all going to burn.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; I know the whole history of atoms
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; and molecules. I don't care how you
[1:42:31] manipulate them now, friends. It's all
[1:42:34] going to burn.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; I'm smarter than Bill Gates.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Until he repents and gets filled with
[1:42:52] the Holy Ghost and then there's no big
[1:42:54] eyes or little
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; U's.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; What ladder are you climbing?
[1:43:02] What are you burning your life on?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; When we hit middle age crisis, a lot of
[1:43:10] guys go through it. We think, "I've
[1:43:12] worked all these years and I I can't
[1:43:14] keep working like this. What's my future
[1:43:17] hold? What am I going to do?" And then
[1:43:19] they say, "I got to do something."
[1:43:24] And then they start working on what
[1:43:26] they're going to do.
[1:43:28] What am I going to do for my retirement?
[1:43:30] What am I gonna do for my future?
[1:43:36] I got a promise
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; if I would use it.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; He knows my future.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; He will take care of me.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; I can trust him.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God that provideth all
[1:43:51] thy needs. I am Jehovah Gyra.
[1:43:56] But
[1:43:58] I'm going to change my direction. I just
[1:44:02] want to finish this. It's not something
[1:44:05] that you imagine
[1:44:08] or a declaration of creeds. It's not a
[1:44:13] declaration.
[1:44:15] It's not something that you declare
[1:44:22] or some thought thought of some
[1:44:26] instrumental of man but it's thoughts
[1:44:30] knowing Christ himself knowing him not
[1:44:34] even for the word if you know him you
[1:44:38] know the word because he is the word
[1:44:42] then you've got to come back to that
[1:44:47] reality.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You've got to come back to the reality
[1:44:54] of God's word. God's word is a promise.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; It's the promised word.
[1:45:04] What is Malachi 4:5? It's the promised
[1:45:07] word of the hour. What is Luke 17:30?
[1:45:10] It's the promised word of the hour.
[1:45:14] What is Revelations 3 and14? It's the
[1:45:17] promised word of the hour. It's what God
[1:45:20] promised. It's what he said. What is the
[1:45:24] ministry of the son of man? It's what he
[1:45:26] promised. He said that the Lord would
[1:45:29] come back and veil himself in this
[1:45:31] generation. It's the promised word.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; It's his promise.
[1:45:39] Now, there's a reason.
[1:45:41] There's a reason for the promised word
[1:45:45] of God and and you people refuse it.
[1:45:49] They do all kinds of things. They take
[1:45:52] everything
[1:45:53] else. But
[1:45:56] the reason that God makes these promises
[1:45:59] and it's found in first se second Peter
[1:46:03] the first chapter and the fourth verse.
[1:46:06] By these exceedingly great and precious
[1:46:08] promises, we become partakers of divine
[1:46:12] nature and escape the lust of the flesh.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; So by it's by the promise
[1:46:22] that you become partakers
[1:46:25] of the nature.
[1:46:28] So God expressed his character
[1:46:32] in his word. I wrote my note this way.
[1:46:37] He said the promise being fulfilled in
[1:46:40] your life
[1:46:42] is that promised word being made alive.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; So when you take a promise of God, God
[1:46:49] gives you a promise, you take that
[1:46:52] promise, you have faith in that promise,
[1:46:56] you live by that promise. when that
[1:46:59] promised word now is fulfilled.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, God keeps
[1:47:07] his word.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And when that kept word,
[1:47:13] that fulfilled word
[1:47:16] is made alive in your life, now he is on
[1:47:21] display.
[1:47:27] Then his character
[1:47:31] that made the promise.
[1:47:34] So why did he make the promise?
[1:47:37] BECAUSE THAT'S HIS CHARACTER.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I'll not leave you, Dylan, nor forsake
[1:47:42] you.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you,
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; even in you wherever thou go.
[1:47:49] Joshua, be not afraid, neither be thou
[1:47:52] dismayed.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God. I'll be with you
[1:47:57] wherever thou go.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; IF YOU KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS, I WILL NOT
[1:48:03] DEPART FROM YOU.
[1:48:12] if if and so when he makes a promise
[1:48:17] you have TO UNDERSTAND IT'S THE
[1:48:19] character
[1:48:21] and the attribute
[1:48:24] and the nature
[1:48:28] THAT CAUSED HIM TO MAKE that promise.
[1:48:35] So now the promises of God have a
[1:48:37] purpose.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; He gave these promises for a purpose.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; He He LEFT ALL THIS STACK FULL OF
[1:48:48] PROMISES.
[1:48:50] Now we know we got a devil says not one
[1:48:52] of them will work.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; But it's always by the believer
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; that he proves his word. Amen.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; So it's the character that makes the
[1:49:06] promise.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; If I help you do something,
[1:49:16] then the what causes me to help you is
[1:49:20] the love of my heart and the character
[1:49:22] in my nature.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Unless I've got some alternative motive.
[1:49:31] And Jesus said that don't lend that you
[1:49:33] can borrow again. Don't lend and charge
[1:49:36] us.
[1:49:39] If you're compelled to go a mile, go
[1:49:41] twain. If you're asked for your coat,
[1:49:43] give your cloak also. What is that?
[1:49:46] That's character.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; The promises of God were given to
[1:49:54] display
[1:49:55] his character. Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; So it's the character is where the
[1:50:01] promises come from. The attribute, the
[1:50:04] nature, the personality that he is. It's
[1:50:08] what he was and is that produced the
[1:50:13] promise.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Am I making that clear?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; He gave a promise because he could give
[1:50:23] a promise. And he gave the promise
[1:50:26] because he can't lie.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Now pet So he says if he gives the
[1:50:36] promise then the he says the character
[1:50:39] the promise is kept
[1:50:44] then his character that made the promise
[1:50:47] and keeps the promise. So anybody can
[1:50:51] make a promise. I can promise you with
[1:50:53] no character,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; but the character of my promise
[1:51:03] is me keeping the promise.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; So now I'm keeping the promise. I make
[1:51:11] the promise because my heart's desire is
[1:51:14] for you to have it.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to be dismayed. I don't
[1:51:20] want you to be discouraged. I want you
[1:51:23] to know I'm there for you. I want you to
[1:51:25] know I'm going to help you. I want you
[1:51:27] to know I have the power that to get you
[1:51:30] through whatever you think. I want you
[1:51:32] to know that I'm in charge of heaven and
[1:51:34] earth.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; I want you TO KNOW OF GOD BEFORE YOU CAN
[1:51:40] BE against you.
[1:51:46] But all these promises
[1:51:49] are laying dormant.
[1:51:52] They're going unused.
[1:51:57] And therefore, his character
[1:52:00] is on the outside of the church
[1:52:04] knocking, trying to get in.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; I'll not forsake you.
[1:52:17] I he says, "I will come again. I'll send
[1:52:19] you another comforter." It wasn't a
[1:52:22] different comforter. It was him in a
[1:52:24] different form.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to come to you again in a
[1:52:30] different form. I'm not going to come to
[1:52:32] you in the flesh. I'm going to come to
[1:52:34] you in spirit. And I'm going to be with
[1:52:36] you in spirit. And I'm going to dwell
[1:52:38] with you in spirit. And I'm going to
[1:52:40] walk with you in spirit. and I'm going
[1:52:42] to be in you in spirit. That's my
[1:52:44] promise.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; His character
[1:52:52] is the same character that makes the
[1:52:54] promise is the same character that keeps
[1:52:56] the promise. And he says the promise and
[1:52:58] keep keep his promise. Then the promise
[1:53:01] is manifest and on display and
[1:53:06] identified in you. Amen.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; He makes the promise.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; You take the promise.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; You believe the promise. The promise is
[1:53:18] made manifest
[1:53:20] and comes to pass. That's him.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; In you.
[1:53:28] By these great and exceedingly and
[1:53:31] precious promises, we are partakers
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; of divine nature.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; But he spoke the promise
[1:53:46] because that's who he is. That's what he
[1:53:48] is. That's what he's made out of.
[1:53:52] And he gives you the promise that by
[1:53:56] that promise
[1:54:00] he can manifest himself.
[1:54:04] Now you can come with some other way
[1:54:09] but God only manifest himself in his
[1:54:11] word. The church has tried to come up
[1:54:14] about revival, but the way back to the
[1:54:17] original Pentecostal faith came through
[1:54:20] the promise of Malachi 4:5. And there's
[1:54:23] not another way back.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Because he came back to correct correct
[1:54:30] the air.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; You couldn't have the former reign, the
[1:54:33] latter rain until you had the former
[1:54:35] reign, the what rain? the teaching
[1:54:38] reign, the ABC reign,
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; THE UNDERSTANDING OF GOD REIGN. IT'S NOT
[1:54:44] TO DEMONSTRATE a power that we have or
[1:54:48] an anointing that we have. It's to BE IN
[1:54:51] A POSITION THAT HE CAN IDENTIFY HIMSELF
[1:54:54] in you.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Am I long? Oh, it's not even noon yet.
[1:55:11] Now listen. So we understand that the
[1:55:15] promise is him.
[1:55:21] If he says I'm the Lord thy God that
[1:55:24] heals you all diseases by my stripes you
[1:55:26] are healed. That isn't a promise a
[1:55:29] separate from him. That is him. Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; He is the great physician.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; He is the healer.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I took these stripes. I want you to know
[1:55:43] that by these stripes, there's no sin
[1:55:47] laid to your charge to keep you from
[1:55:50] getting your healing.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; There's no curse that Satan puts on you.
[1:55:55] There's no sin that can be laid to your
[1:55:57] charge. You got to get that out of your
[1:55:59] mind.
[1:56:02] fight that battle with the promised word
[1:56:04] of God.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; But he has a way. Oh, I hope I can make
[1:56:11] this clear. I'm laboring to make it so
[1:56:13] clear to you. He has a way of doing
[1:56:17] things.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; And his way
[1:56:22] was
[1:56:24] his promise word.
[1:56:28] That's the way that he chose that he was
[1:56:33] going to be manifested in you.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Not you deciding you're going to put on
[1:56:40] some kind of new Christian nature.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, how are you my brother?
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; How are you today, my brother?
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You are now going to be so humble and
[1:56:53] sweet.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Humility is not how you act. It's how
[1:56:56] you think.
[1:57:00] You can look at says, "Oh,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; oh my my brother Ben,
[1:57:05] my brother, you poor little sorry idiot
[1:57:09] failure. Uh, how are you today?
[1:57:15] Is God treating you fine, my brother?
[1:57:18] Don't ask me for a dime. I ain't giving
[1:57:20] you nothing.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; It's not how you act.
[1:57:25] It's how you think.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; And how should we think?
[1:57:33] Let this mind be in you
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus.
[1:57:43] In closing,
[1:57:45] usually takes me 40 minutes to close.
[1:57:50] And God has never left himself without a
[1:57:54] witness.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; So he gives his promises
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; so he can be on display.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; He gives his promises so he can be
[1:58:10] active in the hearts and lives of men.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; There's only one way God has to get into
[1:58:19] mankind.
[1:58:22] You say, "Well, it's by his Holy
[1:58:24] Spirit." No, THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A
[1:58:26] PROMISE.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name, Lord
[1:58:33] Jesus Christ, and I'll give you my
[1:58:35] spirit. You shall receive the gift of
[1:58:38] the Holy Ghost,
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; WHICH IS WHAT? THE PROMISED WORD.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; If you receive THE HOLY GHOST, WHAT ARE
[1:58:45] YOU RECEIVING? You're receiving every
[1:58:49] promise in the book. Every promise in
[1:58:52] the book is mine. Every chapter, every
[1:58:55] verse, EVERY LINE. NOW you amen EVERY
[1:58:58] WORD OF GOD. AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:59:01] THAT'S THE TRUTH. THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT HE SAID.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; You can shiver and shake
[1:59:12] and disbelieve the word.
[1:59:15] Now,
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; I'd rather shiver and shake and believe
[1:59:17] every word of God.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; But it's by the promises. Listen.
[1:59:27] And God had a witness in that day,
[1:59:31] but his father hated that witness.
[1:59:37] And and his name was Elijah the prophet.
[1:59:42] and his mother hated this witness. But
[1:59:45] yet it was God's witness and stood just
[1:59:50] the same.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; God always has got a people somewhere
[1:59:56] that he can point to and say that's it.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Do you realize that's our claim?
[2:00:13] Then how can we be that's it and have a
[2:00:18] pile of unused promises?
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; How can we go seek some other way of
[2:00:25] getting things done when everything in
[2:00:28] our lives can be done with the promised
[2:00:30] word? our children safe, our jobs kept,
[2:00:34] our bellies full, clothes over our back,
[2:00:38] a good nature, doing the good works of
[2:00:40] God. Everything we have need of is
[2:00:43] laying in the promises of God.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; And he's got he's going to have a people
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; that he can point to and says, "That's
[2:00:54] it." Why?
[2:00:58] Because the character
[2:01:00] of the accepted promise
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; and the coming to pass of that promise
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; the promises coming alive in the life
[2:01:10] because they live by the promise they
[2:01:12] can look and see that promise was
[2:01:15] fulfilled in their life
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; and that's it. That's why he said, "YOU
[2:01:25] SEE THOSE PEOPLE, those girls, why they
[2:01:27] have their long hair and have their
[2:01:28] dresses because they're from another
[2:01:31] kingdom
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; and they live holy under that kingdom.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; That's why we talk about high heels.
[2:01:40] Satan designed high heels to make a
[2:01:43] woman's body take a certain pitch to
[2:01:47] make it look sensual."
[2:01:51] Because the curse in the garden was sex.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Why dress some other way?
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Why try to look beautiful in some other
[2:02:10] way than the beauty of holiness?
[2:02:15] You want to dress sexy, you'll attract a
[2:02:18] sex maniac.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; And he won't be true to you at all.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; But you take somebody that loves your
[2:02:31] character.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; He'll love you like he loves the Lord.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[2:02:46] He'll treat you right.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of you just like God
[2:02:51] takes care of him. Husbands, love your
[2:02:53] wives as Christ loves the church.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Every promise he made to you, you can
[2:03:00] make to her.
[2:03:07] This is real marriage and divorce
[2:03:10] teaching, not a bunch of ways to figure
[2:03:13] out how you can get remarried.
[2:03:16] It's about getting married right the
[2:03:18] first time.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Having the Holy Ghost and getting
[2:03:22] married right the first time, not taking
[2:03:24] a chance. Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care how Google you got out of a
[2:03:30] boy and how sweet his tongue was. How do
[2:03:34] you How sweet do you think Satan's
[2:03:36] tongue was to Eve?
[2:03:39] That's why we call him slick talkers and
[2:03:41] forkid tongue, devil tongue.
[2:03:44] Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, I can't make it
[2:03:48] without you. You're the prettiest girl
[2:03:50] I've ever seen. What am I gonna do? you
[2:03:53] know, oh, would you wash this shirt for
[2:03:55] me? Uh, oh, you know, oh, you're just so
[2:03:59] wonderful, my would you come wash my car
[2:04:01] for me? Uh,
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; I'm pretty soon you're nothing but a
[2:04:07] maid.
[2:04:11] Doing everything you can to please.
[2:04:13] Everything you can to please. Everything
[2:04:15] you can to please. And you ought to say,
[2:04:18] "Wait a minute.
[2:04:20] What are you doing for my spirit? What
[2:04:22] are you doing for my soul?
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Are you taking, you know, have you
[2:04:27] prayed today? Have you read the Bible?
[2:04:29] Have you prayed for me? Wouldn't that be
[2:04:31] a really good thing if one of you young
[2:04:33] sisters talking about just looked him
[2:04:34] dead in the eye and say, did you pray
[2:04:36] for me today?
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; And he said, "No, I was just hoping your
[2:04:44] dress would get tighter.
[2:04:51] There's death in the camp.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; We got to get back
[2:04:59] to the promises of God.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; God never leaves himself. Look, God
[2:05:05] always has. He can point to, "Oh, I want
[2:05:08] to be among that number." I'm sure we
[2:05:12] all want to be there. It's the desire of
[2:05:16] every heart. We want to be among the
[2:05:18] number that God can say this is my
[2:05:23] people.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Look at them.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; So when they look
[2:05:31] what is it that God wants them to see?
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; He wants them to see his character,
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; his nature.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Where do you get that nature?
[2:05:45] from the exceedingly precious and great
[2:05:49] promises of God, we become partakers of
[2:05:54] divine nature. So if you're leaving THE
[2:05:57] PROMISES OF GOD UNUSED, you're leaving
[2:06:00] the display AND THE CHARACTER OF JESUS
[2:06:04] CHRIST UNDISPLAYED and unused. AND IT'S
[2:06:07] THE ONLY METHOD HE HAS IS BY HIS
[2:06:10] PROMISED word
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; for this age and every age and every
[2:06:15] scripture
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; we want to be among the people that say
[2:06:22] this is my people. Look at them. They're
[2:06:24] an example of what
[2:06:28] I
[2:06:30] am.
[2:06:35] Our mind auto automatically goes back to
[2:06:40] what can I do in my life to change my
[2:06:44] actions
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; to be more like him.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching that.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I'm saying there's a pile
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; of unused promises.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; Get one.
[2:07:01] That's right.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; LET IT COME TO PASS IN your life.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE IS ON DISPLAY.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Am I making myself clear?
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; I know it's not the modern trend.
[2:07:17] Everybody wants something to fall out of
[2:07:19] the sky,
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; but God's already planned it.
[2:07:29] He's already laid down the way.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; It was his what? His word.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Back to the word. The very first words
[2:07:38] in the scripture were his promises. The
[2:07:41] day you eat thereof is the day you die.
[2:07:44] You can take of every other thing in the
[2:07:46] garden, but don't eat this. The day you
[2:07:48] eat that, you die.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; It was a promise.
[2:07:56] It's all been a promise. Jesus fulfilled
[2:08:00] what?
[2:08:02] Every promise
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; concerning him.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; We will fulfill
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; every promise concerning us.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Use the promises of God. Young sisters,
[2:08:17] use the promises of God for your
[2:08:19] husband.
[2:08:21] Young men, use the promises of God for
[2:08:24] your wife.
[2:08:27] Our messenger,
[2:08:29] because he was a prophet of God and the
[2:08:32] word of prophet, he could speak the
[2:08:34] promises of God for our age.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; I am the voice of God to you.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; That's what he said in closing this
[2:08:47] morning.
[2:08:49] This is my people. Look at them. They're
[2:08:52] an example of what I am. They are
[2:08:55] reflecting
[2:08:56] my life in theirs.
[2:09:01] What was Jesus life? It was complete
[2:09:05] obedience to every word of God.
[2:09:10] It was pre-planned by God. How did he
[2:09:12] pre-plan it? By what? Prophesying.
[2:09:19] He'll be in the grave three days. He'll
[2:09:21] hang on the cross, my bones that stare
[2:09:23] at me. He sat there and gave every
[2:09:25] promise. He'll turn the brokenhearted.
[2:09:27] He'll do this. He'll do that. He spoke
[2:09:29] it. He prophesied it. He told him he had
[2:09:32] to give something,
[2:09:34] some sort of promise that would identify
[2:09:37] him. So he wants to identify you.
[2:09:43] So he doesn't want you to come up with a
[2:09:45] creed, a moral code, your own way of
[2:09:48] living. He's going to identify you by
[2:09:51] giving you a promise
[2:09:56] because it's through that promise that
[2:09:59] you'll be partakers of divine nature.
[2:10:03] Now it's him
[2:10:05] keeping the promised word.
[2:10:08] And in keeping his word, he has now
[2:10:12] fulfilled his word using you as the
[2:10:16] vessel. Therefore, now you become the
[2:10:20] attributes of God.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; He says they are reflecting my life in
[2:10:33] them. They have surrendered their life
[2:10:37] and I'm reflecting my life.
[2:10:41] I got to find the rest of my quote.
[2:10:48] I'm reflecting my life through theirs.
[2:10:52] What a beautiful thing. How it must make
[2:10:56] God feel good to know that he's got
[2:11:00] somebody he can put trust in. And he had
[2:11:03] a man and his name was Elijah.
[2:11:08] Can I say that the Elijah of our day was
[2:11:11] the first fruits?
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; And one thing that you knew about
[2:11:17] brother Bram, he believed every promise.
[2:11:24] God wants to manifest himself through
[2:11:27] his people
[2:11:29] and the church wants to manifest itself
[2:11:32] to the people.
[2:11:40] I wonder if that poison
[2:11:44] isn't getting
[2:11:46] in our ranks
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; where we want to manifest oursel
[2:11:52] to the people.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; Let's forget that.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; I don't care what people think about.
[2:12:03] We're a family here.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Let's take care of one another. Love one
[2:12:08] another. Pray for one. Let's believe the
[2:12:10] promise of the word. Let the world take
[2:12:12] care of itself.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; I can't compare my ministry. People,
[2:12:16] they preach far, far beyond whatever I
[2:12:19] can preach. I don't have the ability,
[2:12:21] the energy or nothing. But there's one
[2:12:25] thing I know is I know that the food is
[2:12:28] in the storehouse.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; A man asked me, "Where do you how do you
[2:12:35] pick these messages? How do you find the
[2:12:37] things you do? Where do you get that
[2:12:39] from?" I'll tell you, the storehouse.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; It was what God provided. The
[2:12:46] storehouse. It's in the storehouse. I
[2:12:49] don't have to get it someplace else.
[2:12:51] It's in the storehouse.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; Where was the way back? It's in the
[2:12:59] storehouse.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Where's the character? The identified
[2:13:02] character is in the storehouse.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; WHY? THE STOREHOUSE IS THE STORED UP
[2:13:07] PROMISES FOR OUR AGE. AND GOD MANIFESTED
[2:13:10] HIMSELF IN HIS promises
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; and the promises of God.
[2:13:19] go unused.
[2:13:21] The church wants to manifest itself to
[2:13:23] the people. More numbers, bigger crowds,
[2:13:26] richer people, and so forth like that.
[2:13:29] Better dressed. That's what's got us in
[2:13:32] the chaos
[2:13:34] we're in.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; I'm getting out of the chaos, aren't
[2:13:40] you?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; We don't We're not chaotic.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; We've got a sure path to glory.
[2:13:48] It shall be light
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; in the evening time. The path of glory
[2:13:54] you shall surely shine. The evening
[2:13:57] light have come. It is a fact that God
[2:14:00] in Christ is one.
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; We got all the promises, church.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Let's don't leave them
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; unused.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; You want to manifest Christ?
[2:14:16] God's looking for somebody that can
[2:14:18] trust him,
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; that he can trust that'll take his word
[2:14:24] and believe it.
[2:14:28] A guy asked me, he said, "Well, I want
[2:14:30] to do the will of God." I said, "What's
[2:14:32] the desire of your heart?"
[2:14:35] God gives you the desire of your heart.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; You have got to want to come back.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; You have got to want to be healed.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:46] You have got to want to be one with him
[2:14:49] and in fellowship with him. Ask your
[2:14:52] heart
[2:14:53] if you want that.
[2:14:57] He promised in no wise will I turn you
[2:15:01] away. Seek me and you shall find me.
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; Knock and it shall be opened.
[2:15:10] That's a
[2:15:12] promise. And it's by these exceedingly
[2:15:15] great impressive promises that we're
[2:15:18] partakers of divine nature.
[2:15:23] There's a book full
[2:15:26] of promises.
[2:15:30] Find yourself one.
[2:15:34] Look until you find. Seek and you shall
[2:15:37] find.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Study to show your f proof. fall in love
[2:15:43] with the promises of God's word because
[2:15:47] I'll tell you in reality that's all
[2:15:50] you've got.
[2:15:56] Your car could be busted up pulling out
[2:15:58] of the driveway. Your company could
[2:16:01] crash tomorrow.
[2:16:03] You could be injured. You could get
[2:16:06] sick. You could do all those things. But
[2:16:09] there's one thing that Satan can never
[2:16:12] take from you, and that's the promise
[2:16:15] that God made you.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; And when it's all said and done, what do
[2:16:25] we have? His promise.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Why did he give us his promise? Because
[2:16:31] that's the way he manifest his character
[2:16:34] in you.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Let's stand together.
[2:16:39] You love him.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, he give you a way back.
[2:16:46] And it's not in your actions,
[2:16:48] it's in his promises.
[2:16:54] I just like us to bow our heads and
[2:16:57] and maybe you just ask yourself,
[2:17:00] I know you're busy with your jobs and
[2:17:02] your work and your finances and your
[2:17:06] bill and your future and and all those
[2:17:09] things.
[2:17:11] But I'm sure none of us want to have
[2:17:13] trouble at the river when we come to
[2:17:17] cross that great day.
[2:17:22] But I'd like to ask you if
[2:17:26] if you'd really examine yourself,
[2:17:30] if you could say, you know,
[2:17:33] I'm really not using the promises of
[2:17:36] God.
[2:17:43] The God promised that he'd strengthen
[2:17:46] me,
[2:17:47] but yet I use Red Bull.
[2:17:54] The God said that he'd order my
[2:17:56] footsteps, but
[2:17:59] yet I use
[2:18:02] some form of
[2:18:05] career development.
[2:18:12] I use a lot of things
[2:18:14] to make my life better,
[2:18:17] my health better,
[2:18:19] my life easier.
[2:18:23] And when I do, alls I do is I manifest
[2:18:28] the wisdom
[2:18:30] of my career counselor
[2:18:33] or I manifest the
[2:18:36] caffeine and Red Bull cuz I work longer
[2:18:40] and faster.
[2:18:42] and I'm using all these other things
[2:18:45] that
[2:18:47] are manifested in my life. And
[2:18:52] and yet Jesus said,
[2:18:56] "What does it profitth a man if he gains
[2:18:58] the whole world and loses his soul?"
[2:19:02] And then he made a promise.
[2:19:05] He said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of
[2:19:08] God,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; and all else will be added unto you."
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, I wonder how many times I leave
[2:19:19] that promise unused.
[2:19:21] I wonder how many
[2:19:25] things in the Bible
[2:19:28] that I've never picked up and put into
[2:19:30] action.
[2:19:34] Lord, my prayer for my life in this life
[2:19:36] of this body is that we're a people
[2:19:41] that live by the promises of God's word
[2:19:45] in our daily life. That we're taking the
[2:19:48] promise
[2:19:50] and trusting it
[2:19:53] because that's the only way you can be
[2:19:55] manifested
[2:19:57] is through your promised word. the
[2:19:59] people that he can look at and say, "I'm
[2:20:02] reflected in their lives." I pray this
[2:20:05] morning, Father, that
[2:20:08] my thought was made clear.
[2:20:15] And Lord, I would rather see it in lives
[2:20:18] that
[2:20:21] stop for a moment
[2:20:24] and ask, is there a promise?
[2:20:27] Is there something that God said
[2:20:30] about this situation?
[2:20:35] Is there something that's from heaven
[2:20:38] that I can hold on to to get me through
[2:20:42] this?
[2:20:46] Lord, we take medicine and that's fine.
[2:20:48] That's fine. But it's no good if there's
[2:20:51] not a healer behind it. A doctor can set
[2:20:56] a bone, but it's you that heals it.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't put a trust in any pill,
[2:21:02] any shot, anything.
[2:21:05] My trust is in you.
[2:21:08] And I ask, Father, that
[2:21:11] above all things
[2:21:14] that the love of God would be shed
[2:21:16] abroad in our heart
[2:21:19] by the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:21] That's what we ask, Father, with all of
[2:21:24] our heart this morning for this people
[2:21:30] that they could believe
[2:21:32] every promise of God's word. Amen.
[2:21:40] What is that?
[2:21:43] Oh, be it unto me
[2:21:50] according to your word,
[2:21:56] according to your promises.
[2:22:03] I can say to you,
[2:22:16] the truth that sets me free.
[2:22:21] Oh, and according to your word, oh Lord,
[2:22:29] lead
[2:22:31] to me.
[2:22:34] Oh,
[2:22:35] and lead
[2:22:38] to me.
[2:22:42] according to your word.
[2:22:47] Oh, and according to your promises,
[2:22:55] I can stand secure.
[2:23:01] Oh, come upon my heart.
[2:23:07] and the truth are set
[2:23:11] free.
[2:23:13] Oh, and according to your word, oh Lord.
[2:23:22] Sing it one more time this morning.
[2:23:25] Oh, and be unto me.
[2:23:32] Hallelujah.
[2:23:33] according to your word.
[2:23:39] Oh, and according to your proises,
[2:23:47] I can stand secure.
[2:23:53] Come upon my heart.
[2:23:58] When the truth set me free.
[2:24:05] Oh, and according to
[2:24:08] your word or
[2:24:14] to me.
[2:24:19] This is the end of
[2:24:27] this.
[2:24:31] Hallelujah.
[2:24:33] Oh, and your holy
[2:24:37] presence.
[2:24:40] Oh,
[2:24:41] and
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; just think about it this morning. Let
[2:24:50] his promise become a reality. Oh, this
[2:24:53] is my day.
[2:24:59] Oh,
[2:25:01] this is my day.
[2:25:06] Oh, and your
[2:25:10] word.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; He made the promise to you this morning.
[2:25:17] all to me
[2:25:22] and I
[2:25:29] Lord I'm desperate for you. Just tell
[2:25:33] them you need him this morning.
[2:25:35] Hallelujah.
[2:25:37] Oh, and now
[2:25:45] Lord, I'm lost without you.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; If you need prayer this morning, just
[2:26:02] come. You'll be grateful. Hallelujah.
[2:26:05] Oh,
[2:26:07] he's here this morning to make his word
[2:26:10] a reality to you. Oh, and your holy
[2:26:15] praise.
[2:26:18] Oh,
[2:26:19] and
[2:26:31] this is my daily pray.
[2:26:38] Oh, I missed my
[2:26:48] very worth
[2:26:56] to me.
[2:27:06] Lord, I'm desperate for you.
[2:27:13] You are the answer this morning and
[2:27:25] just sing it one more time this morning.
[2:27:28] Just dating.
[2:27:38] Lord and I'm desperate for you.
[2:27:47] Oh
[2:27:48] God.
[2:27:55] Oh
[2:27:57] without you.
[2:28:02] Hallelujah.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, I come.
[2:28:13] I confess.
[2:28:16] Oh, by in you
[2:28:21] I find my breath.
[2:28:24] Oh, and without you
[2:28:29] I fall aart.

[2:51:34] David Junior, if you could just come in
[2:51:36] and visit us this morning.
[2:51:56] Let us pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, our
[2:51:59] hearts are just rejoicing in your word
[2:52:01] this morning. Father, you've come and
[2:52:03] you've fed us. Your word and Lord, it
[2:52:05] has strengthened us. It has sustained
[2:52:07] us. It's by which you've provided all
[2:52:10] things. Father, we ask that you would
[2:52:12] bless our pastor. Lord, the way that he
[2:52:14] leads, how how precious it is to have a
[2:52:17] a shepherd that's leading by your word,
[2:52:20] Father. And Lord, it's truly your
[2:52:23] provided way. And Lord, as you came and
[2:52:27] confirmed your word to be true. And
[2:52:29] Lord, I just want to thank you, Lord.
[2:52:32] And I'd ask that each one that's been
[2:52:35] here this morning is your word has been
[2:52:37] received into open hearts, Father, that
[2:52:39] they would put your word before them,
[2:52:41] Lord. That you promise that you would
[2:52:44] overlook your word to bring it to pass.
[2:52:47] as we've been recipients of your
[2:52:49] promise, Lord, we can give that which
[2:52:51] we've received. And Lord, I'm so
[2:52:53] thankful for a gospel that transforms
[2:52:56] lives. Lord, as it has transformed us,
[2:52:58] Lord, we can take that same word upon
[2:53:00] our lips, provide it to others, and
[2:53:02] watch your promised word come to pass.
[2:53:05] Father, we just want to commit each one
[2:53:08] as they go into your hands, Lord. That
[2:53:12] Father, that you would be able to apply
[2:53:15] your word, Lord. Give us eyes of
[2:53:17] understanding. May you be the first
[2:53:19] thing we look to. May we look to the
[2:53:21] provision. What did you have to say
[2:53:23] about it, Father? Quicken us, I pray.
[2:53:26] Grant us vision. We thank you, Lord, for
[2:53:28] this wonderful time and the mighty
[2:53:30] things you've done. You're worthy of our
[2:53:32] praise, Father. We thank you once again
[2:53:35] Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you for this message.
[2:53:40] Amen. He became sin
[2:53:45] who knew no sin
[2:53:48] that we might become
[2:53:51] his rightousness.
[2:53:54] He humbled himself
[2:53:58] and carry the cross.
