Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 4th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Brother Arthur, if you could just come and take the snakes before the church. The brothers that are taking the offerings, [music] if you could come this morning. [music] &gt;&gt; Let's pray the Lord. We say thank you, Lord Jesus Christ, for the grace that you've given [music] us &gt;&gt; to be in your house this morning. &gt;&gt; Your grace and your mercy, Lord, &gt;&gt; that's our victory, Lord. Without your grace and your mercy, we won't be able. But he pleased you since the foundation of the world to [music] elect to choose us. It's without price &gt;&gt; and without money. It's just your grace. We bless your holy name because you only chose us as we even when we know we are not worthy but your grace chose us. &gt;&gt; We are a very privileged people. a a known people chosen of God himself. Thank you Lord Jesus for your love towards us. [music] You kept us last year. Your grace has crossed us through the new years. You brought us to your house this morning. We say thank you. It's a word. It's a house of correction. It's a house of blessing this morning. It's a house of solutions. We have come to meet you and not [music] meet a person. We have need of your word. We have need of your presence. We have need of your solutions. [music] We have need of your blessings. Lord Jesus Christ. We don't want to come to this place and make it do what is contrary to your word. Let it be that from the pulpit &gt;&gt; even in the midst of your people that [music] there be nothing but your word Lord. That's why we are here Lord. That that same word Lord is bringing us [music] is telling us to bring all our needs and our care to you. You ask us to bring to you all that we have as God and to come and lay it at your feet so we can receive the solution from you. &gt;&gt; If you didn't say it through your word, we were not going to pray. We we pray because you told us to pray. And the result of our prayers, it doesn't [music] depend on who we are. It depends on our obedience to your word. We come [music] before your throne and to ask for your your mercy. [music] There's needs, there's problems, there's difficulties, there's questions, but the one who gives solution to all of those, it's you, the Lord Jesus Christ. come in our midst. Take the problems of each one of us, all that are here and all that are not here. All that are traveling [music] that when they will only remember that you you are the Lord God who said, "I am the Lord thy God who health thee of all thy and I am the one who giveth thy peace." Father, let it be from heaven that a solution may be found [music] for each one of us. For all of it we committed to you. &gt;&gt; Bring your word, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless our souls. Let us eat with joy. Oh Lord of God, because our lives depend on it. We commit ourselves to you. You the God of our father. You the God of our goodness. God of our solutions and joy.

[music] How I need you. How many can say I need your catch this morning and [singing] find [music] my dry broken places [music] thirsting for you. [music] will be [singing and music] and far away from you. [music] You are all [music] I ever need. I make me [music] pour your spirit out of me. [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, sat. Oh, I come and fall [music] aresh on me. &gt;&gt; Oh, heal my heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, and make [music] me home. Oh, I need you now. Just sing it as a prayer [music] once again this morning. Pour your spirit, Lord. Oh, pour your spirit out of [music] me. Oh, such &gt;&gt; such [music] [music] my [music] heart my heart. Oh, and make me whole. Oh, and I [music] need you now for your spirit. [music] Who thought the sun to stand in the morning? [snorts] Who [singing] told the ocean you can [music] only come this far? [music] Oh, and her show. [music and singing] Oh, and wait till I [music] even Oh, and [singing] those words alone [music] can catch a falling [singing] star. [music] I adore my redeemer. [music] Hallelujah. Oh, [music] I my redeemer. [music] Holy. Oh, [music] and let creation [music] my redeemer. [music] &gt;&gt; It's the same God this morning all the same. &gt;&gt; He hasn't changed. [music] I fall and right to the [music] end of the we never say [music] gentle. Lord have me [music] when I walk. What a dark day to bring vtory. [music] I know I [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] I know my redeemer [music] creation. [music] I redeemer. [music] Oh, he is to [music] take away my s. Oh, he lives [music] forever. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Lord, I took pain for my skin. Oh, [music] the precious life he gave. But now he's alive [music] and there. [music] Let's all stand and sing with this as we call our [music] [music] redeemer. Oh, [music] let all creation testify his life within me. [music] I know my [music] redeemer. You hold my moment. You calm [music] my raing seas. You walk [music] with me through fire and keep my [music] trust [music] in you. [music] Hold my trust in [singing] you. I believe you're [singing] my [music] you are all I need. I believe you. I believe [music and singing] you're my portion. I believe you're more than enough [music] for me. Jesus, you're [music] all I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, how true. You are all we need. It's hard to hang on to that sometimes, Lord. Things seem to be moving so fast around us and [music] changes are just happening everywhere. But yet, you told us you would remain ever the same. And I believe that with all my heart, Father, I ask this morning that the simplicity of your word would touch our hearts. Father, as we look into the storehouse that you left to guide us in this last hour, Father, may we stay true to it. Though with many it's not popular, father and to some it's become oldfashioned and something of years gone by. But yet, Father, I still sit down and read the great writings of the [music] Apostle Paul, and I find them to be ever so true, though thousands years written. Father, I sit and I listen to the messenger of our age. And though it seems like it's been a few years, yet the voice still speaks and reveals and sheds light, Father, because it didn't come from time, it came from eternity. And Father, so it's ever so true. So, Father, as we look into these things this morning, may you be our portion and may you help us. [music] We ask this in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. [music] Amen. If you have your Bibles, we want to turn over to um Isaiah 43 and 7 and then we'll read in Philippians 2 and 13. And I believe this morning is uh Ella Thomas Aak's uh last service with us here as she goes to take a job I believe in Phoenix and uh I I I don't I don't want to say how old you are but I believe I dedicated you. How many years ago was that? 22 &gt;&gt; 22 years ago. My time goes. I've seen so I've seen her from this big to this big. I'm not going to go there. Forgive me. She's beautiful and we'll miss her. She's always helped with our Sunday school. She's always had a smile. Uh you you know. So, uh, I know one thing that where she's going, she's going to make us a little dumber and make them a whole lot smarter. So, uh, we wish her all the success and, uh, uh, may the love of God be shed abroad in her heart and may she always be a a good testimony for us here. We're proud of her and proud to uh see her represent us in life no matter where uh she goes. So, God bless you, sis. And come see us often. If you need any help, call. If you need to be rescued, I'll drive out there and we'll rescue you. &gt;&gt; Okay? And don't talk to no boy without letting me know first because I'll investigate him. So, um, you know, God, how many believes everything's pre-planned by God? God knows exactly what he's doing. And, uh, so we trust. Read this little scripture here and then we'll turn to our other scripture. For it is God which workketh in you both to will this is Philippians. I'm sorry. Let's let let's go back. I'll go back and read my first scripture first. Let's go back to Isaiah uh uh 43 and 7. even everyone that is called by my name. For I have created him for my glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have made him. And then let us read again over in uh Philippians 2 and 13. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. Our gracious father we ask you to uh bless your word to us this morning in Jesus precious name. You may be seated this morning. Um uh I it it was on my heart and uh to um uh go to this this uh message that is uh it's it was preached in uh uh March 20th uh 1964 and it's called God's identified himself by his characteristics and and there's I just want to go through it with you a little bit this morning read statements and and talk about some of the riches that are stored up in the word of God for us because you know uh God's interested in you as he said everyone that calleth on my name I have made him you know what I I mean, he he's it that you are his workmanship for his good pleasure and uh and we're forained under good works that we should walk into them. So, we know that God's hands in our life. And so, we want to talk a little bit and more of kind of a not evangelistic or or but just more of a just a teaching this morning. uh uh uh direction in our hearts and our lives that we might find uh the deeper purpose for I believe that God has a purpose for everything he does. He had a reason for calling you. He had a reason for choosing you. He had a time to call you. Uh uh we often wonder, you know, why did God let me go so long? Or why did he let my loved one go so long? Or why did he let these things happen in my life? Well, the wonderful thing about things that happen in your life is that they don't carry over to eternity. So that's what the blood's there for. It just washes all those things away. and he's going to carry out his plan. But I noticed something uh coming back uh on one of my flights [snorts] here a while back and I noticed uh and I noticed it in the restaurant the other day. I was out shopping the other day and I noticed it again and I started seeing it everywhere and I thought this is interesting and it was a symbol of IU and I thought IU. I said huh. So, I did a looked around a little bit and that stands for the universe and uh I I'm going in and out. Is it the mic? It's me. All right, I'll just figure it out. So, uh the So, this it's a school And for once in a hundred years they finally have a football team that is rated the number one football team in the country. So all of a sudden everybody is wearing their hats and their jerseys and their t-shirts and everything and they want to be identified with this university where for years you didn't even know that school existed. Nobody nobody uh stood up and represented the University of Indiana. uh you know I think that they might have won four football games a year you know but now when basketball season came around now then they would all come out but they never identified with football so but now boy everywhere you go they're proud of of of that and so that they're identifying but I'm I don't want to talk about identification this morning as identif ification by association. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so that's that's what that is. That's identification by association. They want to be so associated and so they'll put on the thing or they'll put on a jersey. Uh in Dallas here for a long time, we had a a very popular football quarterback named Roger Stalach. and uh I've had the pleasure to meet him and and can and watch him play basketball and and big athletic guy, you know. So uh uh if you know I thought well I could go wear his jersey and you would see everywhere people wearing number 12. I I hope that was his number. Sorry if it wasn't. But so they they would wear it number 12. And so they put on the the jersey and they're associating themselves with the quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. So they want to identify with the team, &gt;&gt; but that doesn't make them &gt;&gt; Roger Stala. &gt;&gt; You understand? It it it it has it has absolutely uh it it doesn't even affect them uh whatsoever. So it's not identification by association. Uh Rogers Dalbach, we'll just use that gentleman or or Babe Ruth or Michelangelo or whatever we know. We know if that spirit was in us then we'd have the same characteristic. So we would be a he identifies who he is by his characteristics. You can you can try to associate with him by putting on his hat, by putting on his jersey. You can do an association, but those characteristics aren't identified in you. So the association don't make you him. You see, there's something that that makes you uh what that you are. And I'd like to uh share this statement. He said, now this the spirit of America is supposed to be a Christian nation. &gt;&gt; Now we claim to be a Christian nation, but the spirit of this nation is not Christian. So you you see that we associate, in other words, we associate, we're supposed to be a Christian nation, &gt;&gt; but the spirit of the nation is not Christian. &gt;&gt; And if I don't care if you want to put that up there, it's paragraph 29. We if you start playing it, I'll start listening and I'll sit down right now because there ain't nothing like it from the original. So, uh I don't know if that's a subtle message being sent from the back there. But it the but the spirit of the nation is not Christian. It might be called the Christian nation, but it's a million miles from it. It's characteristics. See, &gt;&gt; so you know, I mean, our our country is so divided. We realize that uh you know, we went in and captured somebody that some people thinks a criminal. this and the very same people are over here screaming criminal and there's a whole another group in the same place saying free the man &gt;&gt; you know and they want to it just it's like I I'm so thankful that God didn't have us follow politics &gt;&gt; you know what I mean his kingdom is not of this world it's a very simple election process you vote for him. He votes for you and that's a majority and the it's one right there. But he said he said so she said to me, she says, "Well, aren't we Americans?" I said, "No, we live here. It's our country. We stay in it. We love it. is the best nation in the world, but yet we're not Americans. &gt;&gt; I said we are born from above. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit come down and we belong to a kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not of this world. I said that's the reason that our sisters wear dresses, wear long hair, don't wear makeup. See, their characteristics identify them as holiness unto the Lord from above. &gt;&gt; So now their spirits identifying them, &gt;&gt; their characteristics are identifying them. So they're identified by their characteristics. And it goes on to say, "Therefore, we are seeking a kingdom. We are seeking a king to come and receive his subject to his kingdom." And they are identified by their characteristics that their treasures are not of this earth or of this nation. It's of above in glory. Therefore, they look for a city whose builder and maker is God. They are properly identified. &gt;&gt; Now God is the one who imparts. You're identified by characteristics. &gt;&gt; You can have the same name &gt;&gt; as somebody. &gt;&gt; I I imagine there's probably I was surprised to find out that there was other David McGearies, you know. So, I sent them all a text and informed them that I was the best looking of all that held that name. No, you can have the same name. &gt;&gt; You can have the same birth date. &gt;&gt; You may even kind of look alike if maybe you uh it was another relative named after the grandfather or something, you know. So you might have two John Smiths and they have the same name, the same birth date, they have all these different things, but what separates them is their characteristics. That's what separates them. The there's that you you you you wait till they uh you could do something that tells them apart. Somebody the other day said, you know, I was wondering who you were. you reminded me of somebody. I was thinking about it, but when you spoke, he said, "I automatically re put it together that you have a brother named Dennis." And uh so uh I tell my usual story. I said, "Yes, that's my older brother." But so but there was something in my voice, something in my mannerism, something in my characteristics that now identified and separated from all the other things that might be the same. &gt;&gt; Your birth date, the color of your hair, the color of your skin, the country that you come from. Uh well, you know, like I I I go down list in names. I went to a graduation, a high school graduation in Canada, uh in Steinbeck, Canada. And there were 221 graduating students. And out of those 221 graduation students, there was only seven last names. Dick Reiner, you know, just over and over and over again. I thought and they could they they it would be Deborah uh Riner, you know, uh uh you know, Mavis Dudik and they just go down and maybe two or three of them the same name right in a row, but every single one of them had was different &gt;&gt; by their characteristics. And you know even twins &gt;&gt; will have different characteristics. &gt;&gt; Now God did that because he wanted things to be able to be identified. &gt;&gt; He wanted to have us to have a way that we could we could tell things apart. And so that would that's his his purpose in doing something is so he could identify. So when he talked about those Christian ladies they said they they're they're identifying their characteristics identifies that they're from another kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That they have another spirit. They there's there's something that gives them. So God gives characteristics for the purpose of being identified &gt;&gt; and to be able to tell them apart. And we know the example many times that's been given of the bird that flies. You can look out in a distance and all you know is it's a bird. So you could say that's a bird, you know. But if you know the characteristics of certain birds, you watch the pattern in which that they fly, you know, and there's certain birds that they they fly up and then they drop down and fly up and their pattern is like a up and down. And there's other birds that fly straight, you know, like a hummingbird, you know, it just can sit there in midair, you know what I mean? And just go like this. You just And then when it flies, it's you know, and then it just darts, you know, and and you can you know that no other bird moves like that. And so now you've identified that bird is a hummingbird. [snorts] Okay, we're trying to to get this something here. So we so God gives identifications for for the purpose of of knowing the difference. Okay. So if if God therefore he he gives these the the difference [snorts] he when he spoke something then he has to identify what he's spoken. &gt;&gt; You understand? Because he's the creator [snorts] &gt;&gt; right? So if he said let there be light now we're left to sit there and say what is light. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So now he has to identify light. &gt;&gt; So that we can now tell light from darkness. &gt;&gt; So he said let there be light and there was light. And so when light came, it had characteristics that could be identified as light. Therefore, God spoke his word. His word is spoken. And when his word is spoken, that word automatically possesses certain characteristics that will identify it as the word. &gt;&gt; You understand? He put the characteristics in it just [snorts] like he made the male deer to have antlers. Everything might look the same, but how do you know whether that's a male or a female? Well, you you just look and you see all of a sudden it's got uh horns. Even on small deer, that little deer will have what we call a button, a little teeny button on top of its head. And we know that's a a a a male deer. And so though everything else is the same, he God puts characteristics for the purpose of them to be identified. Not now, we're not talking about identity by association. You understand? We're talking about identity by divine spoken created characteristics. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the characteristics, let me take the word characteristics and maybe add it to the word character &gt;&gt; because we're not talking physical characteristics &gt;&gt; when we're talking spiritual, &gt;&gt; but we're talking character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus began to speak. He began to tell his disciples about a new character. When you're buffeted, buff it not back. When [snorts] you're smoked on the cheek, turn the other cheek. When somebody compels you to go a mile, go twain. So, what started to happen is you started to realize that he now was preaching about a character, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Not physical characteristics. God always identified he identified his the children of Israel by a physical characteristic that separated them. So God's is we know that his word calls for total separation from unbelief. So God he what he what he's doing is is he's giving character for identification and for something else. And so when we if his word is spoken and he says let there be water or let there be now he identifies water by its characteristic what it is and we can try to break it down and say well it's got two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen and that makes water, you know, and I've went and got hydrogen and oxygen and tried to shoot them together and I never could produce water, man. But anyway, it just how it is, you know, God knows how to do things. So as we as you you got my I hope that you have the principle of what I'm talking about here because this is a a great age that we live in and a great spirit uh h in the land of everybody talking about deliverance. you know, be delivered from this, be delivered from that. Uh if you if you're playing uh phone games, you know what I mean? Then the preachers pre you need to be delivered from phone games, right? Or if you're listening to music, you need to be delivered &gt;&gt; from music. And so deliverance is a uh is a major part of Christianity because we have an enemy that shackles us. &gt;&gt; So we desire to be free &gt;&gt; and and and that desire in us calls out for us to to want freedom because when we're preached, condemnation comes. And many times alls we really want to be free of is the condemnation, &gt;&gt; not the thing itself. &gt;&gt; So if something was bad, let's just take a game or something. If if I said that this game is bad, then uh you would come under condemnation and say, "I want to be free from this condemnation." But if I came back and said, "This game's okay." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I can play this game. &gt;&gt; You see, and you miss really what deliverance is. &gt;&gt; What where where really is the deliverance? It's not in the right or wrong. &gt;&gt; It's in something much deeper. &gt;&gt; And and so if I I'd like I'm going to read from the uh this paragraph uh 34. It says, "And this God raised up a prophet named Moses, and the man was taught in all the wisdom of Egypt." No doubt. But what he was a great smart intellectual man for he could teach the Egyptians wisdom. &gt;&gt; Look like a properly fitted man for deliverance. &gt;&gt; Now just follow this through. And I hope that we I'm going to try to be short today. But you see what we call deliverance and what God calls deliverance is something different. &gt;&gt; So sometimes we think deliverance is, oh, I'm just free from this or I'm free from the condemnation. But if you just go from one chain to another chain, you've never really been delivered. It's like going from the rock pile, you know, crushing rocks to going to carry in the basket. &gt;&gt; You know, it it you're still you're still working for the slave master. &gt;&gt; You've just switched jobs. you know, he's just giving you a little something easier to do for a little while to appease you, you know, and and but yet you're you're still under the taskmaster. So, you think, well, I got delivered from I got delivered from games. You know what I mean? But now I listen to AC/DC. &gt;&gt; Is that right? How do you know? You know, I don't know which one they are. I saw some guys all painted up like monsters. I don't know if that was them or not. But you see that that's not what we got a different idea &gt;&gt; of deliverance. And that's what he's saying. God is different. what's deliverance to us is not deliverance to God. &gt;&gt; And that's what he said. So, as you see, what we call deliverance and what God calls deliverance is a different thing. Now, watch this man with all of his ethics. &gt;&gt; He knowed he was born to deliver the children of Israel. Yet, with all his education, that's all he knew about. and knowing that he was called of God to do the job. He had all all of his he had his bachelor of arts and his PhD and his LLD and so forth. And he went out to deliver Israel and was a total failure. Now, I hope we could catch this. Notice look like him being with his foot on the throne in Egypt to become Pharaoh. He could have delivered the children of Israel after he became Pharaoh, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Simple. &gt;&gt; God wants him delivering. &gt;&gt; Just let him become Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Go on out. Good. I &gt;&gt; pretty good deal. &gt;&gt; I mean, sounds like the easy way. That sounds like deliverance, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that would have been it seems like a much better way to deliver deliverance &gt;&gt; than really what deliverance was about. And so he he goes on, he says this. He said because he was next in line for the throne. But you see that in doing it that way, it wouldn't identify God's characteristics in delivering his people. He said he would deliver them. He he would deliver them with a mighty hand. Not Moses with a mighty army, but God with a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh you so you you if you see what is is being said here is that God delivers by character. &gt;&gt; By characteristics. It was what that he was going to deliver them by. It couldn't be. So I better just stay there just for a second. Power apart from character &gt;&gt; is satanic. &gt;&gt; So many times we think it's the power &gt;&gt; that delivers us. the power, you know, the laying on of hands, the the the casting out which all those things we will do. But Paul said, "Wherever there's tongues, wherever these things, for these things will cease, &gt;&gt; but let us move on to perfection." So there there's something else that God's trying to accomplish more than just delivering people from the sufferings and from the weaknesses that they have in their flesh. &gt;&gt; And though we're always in that battle, tempted, falling, getting lifted up. And and and so we think if we get rid of one thing, that's deliverance. But that's not what God sees as deliverance. God delivers by character. &gt;&gt; Character I is the character. God is going to deliver us by character. In other what really delivers the believer if you if you see what I'm saying is that God speaks something &gt;&gt; and that has its identifying characteristics. &gt;&gt; So if God speaks anything, he speaks the word and he's got to identify it. He's got to give it identifying characteristics, &gt;&gt; things that you could tell them apart. Just like those ladies, he said, "Look at the way they dress." They're doing that because they're identified. They believe in another kingdom. And the character and characteristics of what they believe is reflecting through them. So God he in in giving the the believer and and this is where we stand this morning and can I hope this will just help us going forward in the new year. We believe that we're the spoken word children of God. Right? Is that what we say? &gt;&gt; And there's we believe we're predestinated. &gt;&gt; We believe we're in the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; And so it's not like an army that delivers us. It's the fact that within us we have identifying characteristics or certain things that's going to prove to us and prove to the world that were his bride. &gt;&gt; It's the character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, if a person got that character &gt;&gt; of dedication, &gt;&gt; he got the character of devotion. He got the character of sacrifice and the and the characteristics of a believer God put in there. &gt;&gt; And so he speaks the word that those characteristics and that character might come to life because it's that character that delivers you. &gt;&gt; If you had the character, you're not going to do that. Your character and the identifying qualities &gt;&gt; that God put in his bride &gt;&gt; is what has power over the enemy. &gt;&gt; And that's why John said if you love the world or the things of the world, the love of God is not in you. But if the love of God is in you, then you would abstain from the appearance of evil. It's it it and we begin to realize that in what that he's doing, he's he's wanting to now identify himself in his bride. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So if it's his word, then that word has to have certain character. &gt;&gt; It's got an identifiable character. Because he's going to do something that can't be duplicated, &gt;&gt; right? So obviously we would think that it's empower and demonstration &gt;&gt; and we do have that &gt;&gt; but our motive for having that is a character motive. That's why it's not satanic &gt;&gt; because we do it with the divine character of God. So we don't lay hands on anybody suddenly. We pray. We seek the face of the Lord. The bride stays still till she has thus sayaith the Lord. She is now living by identified character. The character that was spoke in you before the foundation of the world. When he spoke that yellow hammer, that bird, he he we call it yellow hammer. I'm sure it's got some one of those fancy Latin names that people that think they're smart say, you know, it's it's bird, [snorts] you know, but he put that characteristic in that &gt;&gt; to identify that bird. &gt;&gt; So when that bird moves, you know what it is. [snorts] Now if he spoke a bride &gt;&gt; then he has to give that bride a character &gt;&gt; and characteristics that separate her and identify her as bride. &gt;&gt; It's not something that can be duplicated. &gt;&gt; It's not done by just association &gt;&gt; by putting on the jersey by putting on the name. But it it's proven by the character of the life that's lived. &gt;&gt; You you know that's a person. So if we if we were walking and everybody was dressed the same and and you walked up and you slapped one guy and he was ready to duke it out and you slapped the other guy and he turned the other cheek. Now, they both might be called Christians. You know what I mean? They both might go to the same church. They might be twins for all that matter. But one has the identifying character of what God spoke. You are his workmanship &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus for ordained unto good works. I have made you. I have formed you. I have spoken you. [snorts] And therefore, if he's done that, then he wants to identify you as his. &gt;&gt; We we always think on our side of it that we have to identify ourselves with him. And the obligation is on us. And and deliverance isn't always what God calls deliverance. So we we think, well, I better line up. I better do this. I better do that. The truth of the matter is it's him. &gt;&gt; He spoke to you. &gt;&gt; He said you were bride. &gt;&gt; He called you. He put your name on the lamb's book of life. Now, he's got to identify that you are that person by having the your characteristics identify that you're the bride. &gt;&gt; So, he had to put them there. &gt;&gt; They have to be there. So we we it it's not so much a struggle of us trying to become Christian but as much as it is allowing him &gt;&gt; to identify himself &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; And character is really where the victory is for a Christian. having the character of Christ, being a new creature in Christ Jesus, having a nature. That's why when a person's born again, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden they're going to run out and start laying hands on the sick and people are going to recover and they're going to prophesy and they're going to all those things. But I'll tell you what happens is they have a nature change. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden they look on one another different. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said they'll know your are my disciples by your love one for another &gt;&gt; by the character that you have by the nature that you produce by the atmosphere that you create. Now, you know, there when the skunk's around because he creates an atmosphere, &gt;&gt; you know, we we got a lot of spiritual skunks. The the the it doesn't matter what jersey they have on. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what hat. It's not it's not identification by association. And it's not us identifying with him, &gt;&gt; but it's him identifying himself &gt;&gt; in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he spoke to us. He said who we were. &gt;&gt; That's right. And if you believe that, then you know by faith that he's got THAT THOSE THE CHARACT HIS character has to be in you BECAUSE THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM become one. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm not there, but I'm going to be there." &gt;&gt; Because the very character desires it. The character itself &gt;&gt; doesn't need the fame. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need the recognition. &gt;&gt; It's not driven by outside sources. It's driven by what God put in its heart &gt;&gt; to hunger and thirst after righteousness. &gt;&gt; It's the brook springing up on the inside. It's like the little grass seed &gt;&gt; that gets germinated. It's going to find its way out to the sunlight. Like the lily in the bottom of the pond. It's going to work its way up through the muck to the sunlight BECAUSE ITS DESIRE IS THE CHARACTER BECAUSE GOD WANTS TO IDENTIFY himself in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got to prove who his bride is. &gt;&gt; You'll never do it. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep know my voice, &gt;&gt; and another they won't follow." He said, "I'll never leave you nor forsake you, &gt;&gt; but I'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness." So we, if you could understand what I'm trying to say, it it's not the being free from something that's your deliverance. Your deliverance is the possession &gt;&gt; of the character &gt;&gt; because that'll continually &gt;&gt; to deliver you &gt;&gt; after situation and situation. It's not one situation from the next. So God had to deliver with his character. &gt;&gt; God's characteristics, God's character, what had to deliver. He could have used the army, &gt;&gt; but it didn't represent the way he does things. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to be the representation of how that God does things. And how do we get there? Faith cometh by hearing, hearing by the word of God, by divine revelation. And sometimes we look in the mirror and say, "I'm really not acting very nice. I'm angry. I'm bitter." None of those are characteristics. So if you got rid of the bitterness, you're just waiting for another situation to make you bitter. But if you put divine love there, &gt;&gt; now you have the character and that character will deliver. &gt;&gt; So you got to remember it's not something that can be duplicated &gt;&gt; or a doctrine. It's actually a character. And so I I want to read paragraph 51. But you see, Moses being the correct prophet of God not only had the fundamental parts, he had the identification of God. He had the identification of God. See, he was in line of duty exactly what was promised for the age, not for the age of Noah, but for the age then. I will take you to the land that's flowing with milk and honey. They were on their way and Israel was identified with their prophet Moses with the message of the age. &gt;&gt; God's characteristics identified Moses. God's characteristics identify you. &gt;&gt; That's what we've come. We've entered into a union. So now what's identifies us is not our doctrine. &gt;&gt; Everybody can take the doctrine. &gt;&gt; Okay, you there's a lot of people that don't believe in the trinity. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that baptize in the name of Jesus Christ. Don't think that the doctrines that we have are only we're the only ones that possess them. &gt;&gt; There's lots of people that do good works, &gt;&gt; but it's the character that separates. is the character that separates you and identifies you of not being a nominal believer of the age. &gt;&gt; It's where you walk. &gt;&gt; It's where you speak. &gt;&gt; It's how you treat other. It's the love of God shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You possess that character. you you you he's expressing he wants to identify you. You're his spoken word. &gt;&gt; He wants to identify you. So, he's got to put his characteristics like he did Moses. Moses was identified with God by the characteristics that God put in him. Moses wants to identify God wants to identify himself in you as being his bride by the character that he puts in you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope it's not I hope it's simple enough. &gt;&gt; It's it's everything. I'm going to close now. He's so Moses with the message of that age. God's characteristics identified Moses. A pillar of fire was following. He He also had atonement in action. Not speaking it, but had it in action. Now, what will be what is right now? Oh, I could go there for a long time. Just action. God deals with individuals. He is so unusual to the way of thinking. See, we get off in trends and we have to believe it this way. And then God comes around with his word, what he has promised and identifies himself in that word. This group can't go to it because it don't believe it. See, it's done. Cut itself off from them. So, what does he do? He identifies himself in his word. You understand that? Does the word of God say that he would have an elect lady in this day? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's a promise. &gt;&gt; HE SAID SHE WOULD BE HERE. &gt;&gt; SO, she's here. So, we're we're not talking this morning from a standpoint of going forward of what you have to do. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to morning express to you what he's going to do for us. &gt;&gt; He spoke us. &gt;&gt; He called us. &gt;&gt; He's got to identify It's like the brand. Remember, they it didn't matter what brand, but they all had to be bloodline cattle. &gt;&gt; So, we're h how do how do how do we know ourselves from anybody else? It's an individual affair. You're known with YOUR CHRIST BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHRIST IN YOU. &gt;&gt; That's that's the only thing. It's not the group. &gt;&gt; Christianity hasn't changed. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say this. I hope it's not misunderstood. Brother Bram never came to start the messages churches. &gt;&gt; That wasn't what he he wanted. He didn't want groups of ministers and groups of churches and groups of fellowship and and people. He wanted born again Christians. &gt;&gt; He wanted believers &gt;&gt; that believed every word of God and wanted the spirit of Christ to dwell in them. Let this same spirit be in you that was in Christ Jesus who didn't look upon his own needs but looked upon the needs of all those around him. &gt;&gt; That that's what his desire was. It wasn't to go out and have a following. It wasn't to go out to have people identify &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; Put on the hat. put on the jersey, &gt;&gt; put the book. &gt;&gt; That's never That's never what he was after. &gt;&gt; He wanted his word to become flesh. &gt;&gt; Now, we're incapable of doing that. But when we're born again, when the word of God speaks to us and the Holy Spirit comes upon us, you you understand he he can't endure you with power if you don't have character. &gt;&gt; Because character is the deliverance. &gt;&gt; It's his characteristics that deliver you. It's his character that keeps you from fighting, to arguing, punching at one another. He says it's like in the desert. He says when the there's no water of life, then you become real sticky, you know, and you're always punching. &gt;&gt; We don't have to go there. &gt;&gt; We have to let him live. He said, I trying to just lay a few of these things down. See, it was in action. God deals with individuals. And so, he's got to identify his word, right? So, when he when he spoke, he said, "A virgin shall conceive." Is that what he said? Well, then you know what has to happen? A virgin has to conceive. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "My sheep will know my voice." Then there has to be a sheep that knows his voice. &gt;&gt; He said, "If I've started a work in you, I'll finish it till the end." There has to be a people. So if he spoke that &gt;&gt; if I started a work then we know a work has to be started &gt;&gt; and if the work is started we know he'll finish it till the end. &gt;&gt; So our faith is in the word. Our character is that we believe that word. We believe in the kingdom to come. We believe we're going to identify and and live by his nature, by his characteristics. And his characteristics, him in you, identifies you as his. &gt;&gt; You can say, I believe Malachi 4:5 all you want. I met a lot of people that have robbed me blind in the name of the prophet. I've seen I've just seen preachers and I could go I'll get on a pity party here in a minute. I gave a man several thousand dollar worth of uniforms to sell. I said, "Whatever you sell them for, I'll split it with you." He loaded them up in his car and left. Took them and sold them. He didn't give me an offering. just rob me. And I think, what is that? There's no conscience. And you know, that's the thing that Satan does in this last hour is he snears your conscience with a hot iron. &gt;&gt; It's good that you're convicted of sin. &gt;&gt; It's good that you know when something's wrong. It's good that you have that feeling that you're on unstable ground. &gt;&gt; It's good that you feel that that that hand of of of caution and that conviction and that doubt to go down this road. &gt;&gt; But it's the character that listens to it. It's the character that lets him lead and guide you. It's not the belief. It's not the theology. It's character. Without perfect love, you won't be there. What What is the whole thing that we do so much with is the statue of a perfect man. We talk about all those characteristics, all those those things of character, faith, virtue, temperance, godliness, goodness, faith, you know, brotherly kindness, and then capped off with love. &gt;&gt; If if we don't miss it, then we don't understand what God's trying to do. He's he's trying to transform us into being sons and daughters of God with his character so he can stand in us and say, "This is my daughter. &gt;&gt; This is my son. I am revealed in them." Ask your heart. Is that what my heart's desire is? And I'm just I'm gonna read these last two statements and then we we have nine minutes and then we'll close. So, but this is paragraph 68. But you see, it has to be identified by the word. Who is the word? He is the word. &gt;&gt; It has to be identified by him. &gt;&gt; You don't identify yourself. He identifies you. It has to be identified by the word and the word is God. And then the characteristics of this ident identification identifies who it is. The characteristics of this identification identifies who it is. This is my bride. &gt;&gt; It identifies who you are. Your character identifies who you are. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. &gt;&gt; One person might shout, a mother, another one might not. The prophet of God said that one guy got up there and he he spoke in tongues and he said he was a devil. The other guy interpreted he was genuine. He said, "How could this be? The rain falls on the just and the unjust. But he identifies himself. You say, "So what I'm in anticipation of for this my New Year's Day message, what I'm anticipation of is that this year, that character will be built in me &gt;&gt; because that's the character that's going to deliver. God delivers by character. Give me the character &gt;&gt; and I can defeat Satan. &gt;&gt; I can't defeat Satan in my flesh. &gt;&gt; I can't defeat Satan with my willpower. I can't turn the other cheek. I can't close my eyes. I can't look the other way. I can't do that by my own strength. I can't do that by my doctrine. I can't do that by my association. I can only do that if it's his character in me strengthening me to do it. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm anticipating &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; that he's going to identify me myself as his bride by his characteristics. Not by what I say, but what that he does. Christ in you, the hope of glory. He says, identify who it is because God said this would happen and it happened. See, the characteristics of it is God's word being identified by the characteristics of what's going on. That's quite a little statement if you want to go back and read it. He said in the last days he'd pour out the Holy Ghost. He He did it. The characteristics of it identified that it was God. His word promised. See, he always identifies himself. Oh, if we could make a lesson out of that that there's so much today now you Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Lutheran, Catholic, whatever you are. See, you are doing the same thing. You are perceiving because that Wesley had a great revival or Luther had a great revival or Pentecost had a great revival. You are perceiving that he's among the people. When sometimes he isn't there. How do you know he's there? When he's identifying his word. I'd like to now if if you would allow I'm going to play the prayer line at the end of this service. [snorts] So he basically said that if God makes a promise, he has to identify that promise by his characteristics. That's a principle. So I can apply that same principle to me. Now I want you to listen as our prophet starts this prayer line and he'll say that's not me. It's him identifying himself that he's here. That's the first fruit that's waved out over. So we can either go into a endless cycle of trying and trying or by faith we can say Lord you spoke it. You've must identify it. And that goes for healing. It goes for whatever that you're facing. If God be for you, who can be against you? [snorts] I I can look at the stain on my white shirt and be dreadful that that stain's there. I can say, "Oh, I've got to throw this shirt away. I've got to get a new one." So, I go get a new shirt. And what do you think I'm going to do next time I eat gravy? I'll have a stack of dirty shirts that I'll never wear again. But I know that there's something that can cleanse that stain out. So, I'm not going to just keep beating myself up, but I'm going to become mindful that when I put my hand on the table and eat like this, I'm going to get gravy on my sleeve. Now, I'm going to make adjustments. Old habits are hard to break, I know. But I'm going to get character. I'm going to start doing the things that I know. I'm not going to I'm not going to start riding so close to the edge. &gt;&gt; I'm going to start being mindful. I'm going to have character. I'm going to stay with the word. I'm going to read my Bible and pray. And it's but believe it or not, it becomes the character that delivers you. God delivers by character. By identifying himself and putting himself in you and letting those virtues come out, he identifies you. So Lord richly bless you. But if and you'll be able to follow along here. Paragraph 221 out of God's identified by his characteristic uh March 20th, 1964. Now, now if Jesus is alive and I've talked of his word, there you are back to that simplicity and faith believing his word. When he met me that night, he said, "You'll come to pass that you'll even know the secrets of their heart. &gt;&gt; They won't believe that first sign of the hand. They will have to believe this one." &gt;&gt; If they don't do that, then blood curses the earth just like it did in Moses time. said, "If them two signs and pour blood upon the earth, pour water upon the earth, it'll become blood." Now, just uh find out if I can just see what your trouble is. That'll be satisfying, make you believe what you know what have to be the characteristic of the person I'm talking about, Jesus Christ. A man, as I look at him, moves back, he's shattered. There isn't a thing that medicine would ever help the man. He's in a dying condition. That's right. He's had an operation and the operation was a prostate operation and it's cancer and the cancer scattered all through you. That's right. Raise up your hand. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Only God can heal you. &gt;&gt; But look, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want to say something to you, sir. That devil might have hid from the doctor's knife, but he can't hide from God. &gt;&gt; You believe that? And I pray that in the name of Jesus Christ, may the thing leave and may the man live. &gt;&gt; Nothing just got weak. &gt;&gt; All right. You and I are strangers to each other. A man and a woman meets. Now, as a man, I don't know you. And perhaps as a woman, you don't know me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No more than you just see my name or picture or something like that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we don't know one another. That's our character. We don't know one other character. But the characteristic of Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the word and the word is promised for this day. You heard me speak of it. Then his characteristics would identify him here. Not me identify him. I don't know you. You understand God. You understand that? &gt;&gt; I'm a man. I'm just your brother. &gt;&gt; Like the woman at the well. Say [snorts] something's wrong. Something is wrong with you or what you want or what you're here for. Let God be the judge of that. &gt;&gt; You are suffering from anemia condition. That is right. Is it? &gt;&gt; I I constantly hit that somebody thinking I guessed it. I don't guess that. &gt;&gt; No. Every once in a while I feel that somebody you can't hide your thoughts. Now &gt;&gt; he's about I know two real bad skeptics sitting here. So now remember I can call your name too. It's gone. So you quit thinking. Let me show you. Look here lady. Look at me. I don't know what he told you. But I I know what he is. And that's his characteristic identified. Yes. It's anemma condition of blood water. Now here here's something if they think this is got a child you're praying for that you It's got u in his throat, &gt;&gt; tonsils, adoids. It's up for an operation, isn't right? Take that hand and put on it and bleed. Don't doubt it. Won't need to. &gt;&gt; How do you do? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The thing is &gt;&gt; for this woman here that you are scared about something. You're afraid that a birth mark &gt;&gt; has turned to cancer. Woo. &gt;&gt; Now go believing. It won't be that way. Just go believing with all your heart characteristics. Not of me, of him. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; You believe now. That should make everybody believe. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know you. I'm a stranger to you. God knows you. Do you believe that? You know that I don't know. You know you don't know me. So do you believe that this spirit that's speaking cannot be my spirit because me as a man I don't know you. But the characteristic of the promised word is the word that's sharper than a two-edged sword and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. You are very sick. If you had a woman's trouble, which was a wound, and that womb had cancer, and you went and taken some sort of a treatment, his radiant treatment, and the only thing it done is scattered all through you, and you you'll die if God don't heal you. That's true. You believe now, he will heal you. &gt;&gt; May the God of heaven rebuke that devil that's hid from the doctor. You might have hide from raging, but up from the Holy Ghost. Don't believe me, my sister. Don't doubt it all. I believe. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that God can heal that asthma condition, make you well? &gt;&gt; You believe it? Then go on your road rejoicing and saying, "Thank you, Lord. I believe my asthma was done." How do you do? You're nervous. You've been nervous for a long time. In that, it's caused a peptic ulcer to come your stomach, which makes you your stomach trouble. You want you going to eat your supper? Will you do what I tell you to do? Go eat in the name of the Lord Jesus. Do you believe with all your heart your mighty fine young lady looks to be? Do you believe he'd be his servant? You believe his characteristic can be here to the word itself, the promise of this day, the works that I do shall you also can't heal. He's already did that. But his characteristic can tell what's wrong with you. You got a lady's trouble, female trouble. You believe that God heals it now? Go on your road in my body. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be his servant? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If God will tell me what's your trouble, when you believe it's a characteristic of Jesus Christ, it's in your body. It isn't no more. Go believe I'm You also have stomach trouble. Bleed with all your heart. Go eat your suffering. Forget about it. Jesus Christ makes you well. &gt;&gt; Your trouble is your blood, your diabetes. You believe that God will make you well and heal you of that. Go on your road and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you." Go believe your back. You believe that God will heal the back and make you well. Go on your road and rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." You also had something wrong with your back. Just keep on walking, saying, "Thank you, Lord." I'm healed. Believe all your You also had back trouble. What do you know about that? Believe with all your heart, not go on your road and be made well. Believe Jesus Christ makes you well. If thou canst believe, all things are possible. &gt;&gt; All right. What if I didn't say nothing to you, just passed by, laid hands on you, Bisha, get well, they see what's wrong. You wouldn't come here. I resent this devil in the name of Jesus Christ. May the power of God heal your doubt. No doubt. &gt;&gt; If God doesn't heal you, you'll be on a crutch someday with arthritis. But you believe that God heals your arthritis. Then go say, "Thank you, Lord. I believe you and you make me well." &gt;&gt; Come now. &gt;&gt; It's really your age. You're real nervous. Get real nervous late in the evening when you're work and everything. You're real nervous. You bleed now. It won't bother anymore. Go on your road. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Come, sir. Do you believe that God heals heart trouble will make your heart well? Just keep on moving. Say, "Thank you, Lord. I believe with all your heart." God heals TV and makes well too. Do you believe that, sir, with all your heart? All right. Go on your rejoice and say, "Thank you, Lord." What about you out there? Do you believe? &gt;&gt; How about the audience? Right. &gt;&gt; Some of you in the audience now believe &gt;&gt; this man sitting right here with bronchitis. You believe that God will heal the bronical trouble? All right. You're going to have what you'd ask for. Amen. High blood pressure sitting right behind him. Do you believe that God will heal your high blood? It left you, sir. I don't know him. Never seen him in my life. Say, sir, do you believe them spasms in your muscles, nervous muscle spasms? You believe that God will make it well? You do? Raise up your hand if you believe. All right. Your wife sitting there, she's bothered with sinus trouble. You believe it leaves you too, sister? The lady sitting right behind us there has new ritis. Do you believe it God will heal your newest lady? Here's a lady with a little red coat on here. She's sitting there. She has sinus trouble, too. You believe God will heal your sinus trouble? Raise up your hand if you believe it. ANYBODY IN HERE THAT BELIEVES THAT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF JESUS CHRIST is among us tonight, raise up your hand. Say, "I believe it." ALL THAT'S IN HERE WILL ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR HEALER. Stand up on your feet and say, "I believe it." Raise up. Stand up OUT OF YOUR CHAIRS. WHATEVER IT IS, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. I give him to you in the name of the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you just caught a glimpse of what I'm saying. God's identified by his characteristic. That was the promised word and he identified it as being the promised word. But you're the promised word. The brideath made herself ready. The elect lady, he'll identify you by his characteristics. Let us pray. Amen. And those of you who have stood up to claim your healing, the characteristic of the foundation of the believer is faith. A revelation that Jesus Christ is here with us, possessing all of the same characteristics he's ever had all through the ages. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. He forgives the sins that we confess to him. If we touch the hem of his garment, he's just in faithful to strengthen us. Father, may we do a real self-examination of our lives, ask ourselves, how entangled [music] are we with the affairs of the world? And how conscious are we of your presence amongst us? Every bit the same. You manifested yourself. took a vessel and stood right in our midst using that vessel to manifest yourself that you're here for your elect lady to have an invisible union between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. Lord, may we understand that. May we get a vision in our hearts of what that you're doing that that you're Oh, may we die to everything other than your wonderful character. I just ask [music] that you help us and bless us. Father, if there's one amongst us this [music] morning that would like to lift their hand and they say, "I'd like to know Jesus more. I'd like to become more acquainted with him and his ways." And you just like to lift your hand. Just lift my I want to be more [music] acquainted. I My hand is up. He sees your heart and your hand and you just want to say, "Lord, here I am. I I need a lot of help. I I need to I I I really need to get on track with the things of God and not the things of the world. I really need to apply the token to my life. And I am asking you to perform that work in me because I believe that I'm yours. And my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and that you will place your characteristics [music] and your character in me. Father, I hope that this principle that we spoke this morning, I may have not as a minister, as a speaker, been able to express it properly, [music] Father, but I believe that you can give divine revelation to the heart of every hungry heart. Father, [music] how do we know that this word is true? Because we saw it identified [music] exactly by your characteristic [music] and it's never been able to be duplicated since because there's only one promise for this [music] age.
