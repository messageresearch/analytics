the grace that you've shown us for the love that's been projected in this day Lord for the message that's called us out of sin and unbelief and has set us apart Lord to know what you want how to be pleasing to you father and for your spirit that makes it possible to live an overcoming life Lord we ask just you could continue to bless our pastories as a way our brother Billy as he ministered this morning and for all the saints that have gathered again once tonight father to Feast at your table Lord we're committing this service to you and no as man we wouldn't be able to break the bread of life father nor would we be able to multiply it but Lord you're the one who could go to each one in their heart and could speak words of life and Lord our desire is that you would do that now and we commit ourselves to you as unworthy as we are Lord but knowing that you've put a call in our life we ask that you would use it now minister to the needs of your people and we'll be careful to give you the glory and the honor in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray going to continue on where our precious brother Billy kind of ministered from this morning he he ministered on Grace and as I it was very it's very fitting for our age for the time we're at that the message that we're hearing is one of Grace one that's calling out Grace because that is as as it was in the book of Zechariah in the text that our brother took um it was that the headstone was crying Grace Grace as it came down so in Zechariah 4:7 we'll just read that again who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel that thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone therefore with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it and let's turn over to Revelations 22 and verse 17 there's a continuity that um I'm getting a a slight ring up here but that I'll I'll work through it I kind of have to remember I did it for 27 years and I never got it right so we appreciate everyone laboring in the back and their labor Revelations CH 22:1 17 would read the spirit and the bride say come I just need to go one more chapter thank you and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water freely God bless you you may be seated the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing and it and it's it's quite fitting that in this day that we're living in uh is it's it's the Capstone which is coming down which is love which is Grace brother brandom says love and grace are the same thing but it's it's in the understanding of love and grace where there would probably actually be more of a disagreement around what love and grace actually is than you would realize um as the Bride of Jesus Christ we have an understanding of love and grace that the world does not have we don't have a petty love we don't have a petty Grace we don't take the grace of God and turn it into a disgrace but it's the love of God to Deliver us from sin it's the love of God to take us out of the condition that we're in and the set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus so that is that is in direct contrast to what the world would would convey to be Lov and that's just come as you are just stay as you are God loves you the way you are and there's no power in it to deliver you that's right there's they turn the love of God into something dope and God loved us while we were in sin and trespass but he didn't leave us there he identified with us in our sin so that we could be clothed in his righteousness now I I love the the sermon this morning because Grace has a Char God's Grace has a characteristic that the that the world doesn't have God's grace does what you can't do okay so God's grace is one that does what you can't do where the grace almost in a worldly measure would say would turn the reasonable service that you have that you can submit yourselves and do things of the works of your own hands and then they would call those things that you can give yourself a religious sticker and a badge and say the Merit that you've earned is Grace it's the grace of God that you could perform the things that you by reasonable service and commitment can perform but there's a there's a travail that takes place in the heart of the believer there's a thirst for righteousness that that can't be satisfied by any measure of worldly Works any any measure of your own effort and I would say that some of us can do more than others after their ability but even as the Rich Young Ruler would be found in a place where he could say all that I've done I've kept from my youth I've done everything that I could do and I was able to perform it there the word had a way of coming down his his Lane calling his name and his address and say know where the lacking one was right so the none of us are righteous we have no righteousness of our own and if you're a Son of God that because he's going to correct you you're going to come to a place where your ability doesn't have the ability he he the law was to come to magnify your inability that's why when Jesus would come you would say uh whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after hath committed adultery with her already in his heart he says I didn't come to do away with the law I came to magnify the law you know if if your brother comes to you and has need of something you say go away he said he said and you don't minister to the needs right so there's this righteousness that God is calling for in us that I would say um if if we're honest with ourselves and we were to place our sins before us we'd say Lord I'm lacking that's right and that is uh the love of God to reveal to us that there is a lack lacking it takes a revelation of the lacking to truly repent I believe that that's that's in my heart because um as though there would be those who couldn't find a place of repentance I believe it's because God will accept even we heard it this morning I if it's true repentance God will accept it but true repentance takes a revelation that you need God and the word it exposes a lacking and it's because it's by Design I'm going to read uh this may be a little lengthy but I think it just brings continuity this is in God's only provided place of worship this is in 65 November 12th uh to November the 28th in the morning and this is uh starting in 261 notice now when you are a son of God in the house of God you are a part of God's economy Romans 81 then there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus for they are dead to the world alive in him and living in the present day making the word that God has used them a for or foreordained them placing their name in The Bride book and when the waters come upon the seed that's in the heart raises it up to the bride of Christ oh my just perfect as it can be in every age it's been that way the Lutheran under justification the feet raised it like that Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostals under the arms the works and the deeds and so forth he's saying that that's in the arms and so forth had to be calvinist and it had to be Armenian had to be legalist but now we come to the Head the Capstone Grace Grace cap the Capstone cried The Headstone crying what Grace Grace pass from death and Creed into Living Word of the Living God God's only provid Ed plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that Lit off something make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive and subject subject to every promise in the world word subject to every promise in the word I our pastor would say hey don't read this as condemnation read this as a promise when you see that the word calls you to something higher that's a promise that you can obtain to because you can reckon yourselves dead in Christ he you're you're dead in Christ and Alive resurrected sitting in now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the word age quick and spirit the spark the lid off something make you alive seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive subject to every promise in the word then what does that you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you see what he's talking about brother Brown no leaven among you just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus we'll just pause there for a second the the the thing that struck my heart and that I know that I have to be obedient to really is is is the part of leaven and that's because the word causes the challenge and we're not going to shy away because if the we're we're not ones that uh that are without hope we don't believe that this gospel is powerless but it's going to purge us thoroughly sir and we're going to be found in his righteousness the scripture that has been on my heart it's found in 1 John the 2 chapter and in the 15th verse and I'm going to take a a little piece of wisdom from we were in uh New Mexico in Espanola and I told the song leader that if he didn't call my wife out to to sing a song um that I would when when I got when I came out and I don't know exactly what the previous condition was but he got in trouble once for for calling someone up to sink so he couldn't do it and so he said well I just needed to let you know that your husband said that he would call you out if if if I didn't do it so I feel a lot more comfortable reading our Prophet I take this text speaking to the bride of Christ and let me say something to you brother and sister in 1 John the second chapter in the 15th verse we read it if you wish the Bible says if we love the world or the things of the world because the love of God is not even in us now the word there is not Earth it's the Greek or Cosmos which means the world order if we love the Fashions of the Earth the world if we love the trend of the day if we think this is a wonderful time oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's perverted by the devil for if you love The World's order and the things of the present world so present world not the thing you know isn't the word amazing it didn't it it is spoken in such a way that it's a living word that there's a current world order there's a current way the world economy works but you're in God's economy and God could come very specific now and come down each of your aisles but if your love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you remember that and he he goes on and and in this that's in the power of transformation brother brandham talks about the seed and how Satan would tried to to to kill it that he would just poison it the only he can't keep the seed from being there because it's a predestinated seed of God but what he can do we know the parable of the serwer he could try to choke it out with the cares of the world with the things of this life and he if if you're not being fruitful then there's a way that God can be the good husbandman he could come in he can break up the follow ground he can take out the rocks and a lot of times that is simply just the cares and the love of the world it's the and and that's the world order but that's also uh something personal to each of us things that the devil has a Punch coming maybe it's the the lust of the eye the lust of the flesh popularity the pride of life you know those three Avenues are the things which Satan's going to come through and it really constitutes it all avenues that Satan could use to come to you is that scripture where the pride of life and and those things and that constitutes the world order so there's no one in this world that doesn't have a sense of Presser a for self I would say that this scripture doesn't leave any room for anybody to say they're Guiltless okay that's I I read that as one saying Lord I know that my flesh is of this world so it cares for the things of this world I how can that mean that the love of God is not in me right so but there there you can't take it out it's there so there's a there's a recognition that you have to come to that you have an identity that the love of God is in that's not in this right here there's a seed of God that's in you you know the scripture would say in in uh uh let me see if I can find it it it's it's a good scripture Jeremiah 13:23 can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil and died that I I stole gum without anybody telling me to steal gum I was just in the grocery store I was raised better I knew better and I stole the gum and I got caught but it was just in me to do it just in me and yet there's a challenge that's presented see the the law is not going to to the law doesn't leave any unguilty that's why you need a savior because if there was a provision or a way within the law that none would be guilty then I guarantee you us after our religious Minds would it's easier to accept law than Grace I don't know why that is but why would we have a tendency to want to accept law over Grace yet law is the very thing that ministers the necessity of Grace that's that's right but some won't humble themselves to receive it so we just have to search our own hearts with fear and trembling in the message of Grace this is in 61 0827 think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters you can't have Grace without having love they're twin sisters exactly right before you can have Grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't see so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace they were we can see one you can't see one without the other God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he shed his his grace and brought it into our hearts through the Holy Ghost see there's just nothing you can do without working one with the other Grace Grace of God is what saves us I I appreciated the brother's prayer because that was on my heart if you've been shown Grace and you've been shown love and there's been a forgiveness that's come into your life you he who's forgiven much loves much that is an that is a response that you can't manufacture that is a response of God's grace and love projecting into your life and you recognize Lord when I was unlovable you sought me when I was dead in sin and trespass you started to tenderize my heart you started to make you pulled the feathers out of the nest the things I once took pleasure in the things that that sin is pleasurable for a season but my as a Son of God well that pleasure is gone and in the after impact of it it starts just to not satisfy and then when you've been set free of that bondage of that going back out into the world and trying to get temporal satisfaction and you've tasted what it means to be set free from this flesh and the bondage that it was and now you're a free and live in Christ Jesus are you mad at the person who's in bondage did you free yourself did you break your bonds did you find the way out of your prison no we didn't deliver ourselves it was the grace of God that pulled us out of the myy clay and there's an identity that you can have that can Minister Grace and that's the nature that's what the bride is able to Adorn herself in is the love and the grace of Jesus Christ that has robed her with righteousness that she wouldn't have of herself now this is in desperation 6391 I just love how brother Daniel can just boom boom boom pull stuff up like that it's incredible I think we're spoiled here guys I mean I I visit some other places and I love reading along with the quote it really just helps so I appreciate it when they throw it up 63901 this is paragraph 68 now the word plainly states if you want to put this down Galatians 56 that Faith worketh by love see Faith worketh by love and the only way that you can have faith is to have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive I love that um I I looked up the definition of incentive and we'll look at it we probably could just Google it again because I was blessed for reading it but faith is Love's incentive incentive that's exactly what faith is it's an incentive to love now you if you don't have love you can't have faith wow how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her boy see he takes it right in into the type that you can't get out of this now that's in filio now how about in Agape to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you loved your wife and never tell her about it and never sit down and make love to her express it to tell her to kiss her to hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know you know and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it that's the way we do to God we love him we tell him about it and we sit down and we adore him and worship him and see love drives us to it so love is the vehicle love has the faith love has the victory love has us sitting at at his feet telling them he's the lovely one and we adore him the the Victory and love that's been given to you you just have to go back and fall in love if you're cold if you're not seeing the victory in your life if the things and the cares of the world are are creeping in you need to fall in love with Jesus true because his love is greater than anything this world could express it only will ever the world will only ever produce death heartache and sorrow that's right it it it it's full of hypocrisy it's full of ma ill intent and and the what the scripture tells us about love this world can't produce it could only kind of grasp at it in the Realms of filio okay because it's given for the invisible things of God to be clearly manifested in the nature and the things around us man is made in in nature and Beast image and there's a there's a there is a uh measure ofilio of the attributes of God to be reflected in worldly things and and I would even say that if you feed on those things there there may be some things that just seem like they're okay love songs things like that and maybe in some context there is some virtue in it I'm not telling anyone to go out and listen to love songs okay but that's because there is a reflection of the love that God has for us that's expressed in that okay so what is perversion anyways perversion is when you take something that's real and that's genuine because Satan can't create and then he trickles it on down and he adds leaven to it okay and then what we have there's no leaven in it okay I I take that back there's no leaven in it matter of fact let's let's turn to that I I believe that's in found in the context of Galatians um and I think our brother maybe ministered on on some of what this is touches on in the book of Galatians on Wednesday I'll just start at the the first verse but I'm getting I think to some place in here if I'm if my memory serves me well um I believe it covers 11 Galatians 5 Stand Fast therefore in the Liberty wherein Christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage behold I Paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised Christ shall profit you nothing for I testify to every man that is circumcised that he is a debor to do the whole law so now you made yourself subject to the law you're going to seek your righteousness after your works then go ahead and fulfill it big man do it all Christ has become no effect to you my whosoever of you are justified by the law you are fallen from grace for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith for in Christ neither circumcision ath anything nor uncircumcision but Faith which worketh by love ye did run well what who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you a little leaven lenth the whole lump you know it's it's actually quite amazing we think of Leaven as worldly things he's he's even talking about that Reliance on self-righteousness and works can can can spoil the very working the faith that you're waiting there's a hunger there's a thirst after righteousness there's a faith that says God you can perform this work in my heart you can make it so that I no longer desire these things and I need you to perform that amen amen you promised me amen that I could have the mind of Christ and I'm not satisfied with anything left and as the word comes and indicts me I say oo that's not that doesn't line up I lay down and I crucify that and I die to that and I said Christ I want your mind to live in me and that that understanding is a lot you know people talk about putting on worldly rosecolor glasses I wish we could really step into the heavenlies and see ourselves the way God sees us I wish we could see each other as as Christ sees us as blood-washed B Sons and Daughters of God and when the Satan's come and he tried to put a little taint on us God's not attributing that to our righteousness and we shouldn't be measuring others by that either you know and that's the conundrum right we know that God's word calls for total separation from unbelief so there's a paradox here you can't sit there and say you're partaking in his righteousness and then have the mark of the world on you okay we don't sit there and take the the grace of God and turn it into disgrace but we don't feel that this is something that I can I can't help a a butterfly out of the conon okay if I try to you know hey you need help you need to come out of there I'm going to you you know you need to you're missing the standard you're missing the mark the splits too high the shirts too the the the skirt's Too Short it it's hardly ever the dresses that are too short It's usually the skirts okay so that take that one for free but just it's funny the way it says it you know it's not it's not a mini dress it's a mini skirt so it those things they're there but we don't we're not trying to make those a law uh sometimes I think they do need to be preached they're more pastoral but all those things can really do is say Lord it it it it should cause us to just examine our hearts and say is the love of the world creeping in is the love for the things of the world creeping in is is there is there an affection in my heart that has been set upon the things of the world and the requirement for deliverance is absolute I it was put in the Book of Genesis it was put it the the the fall constituted the need for a savior it constituted the need for a blood covering and it even said things that would make us subject to the law of sin and death if it was not for Grace the very attributes of the Fallen nature of a woman and a man are uh what the world rivals in they actually celebrate it and they put it in your face and they say if there was a God then then you wouldn't have a fleshly nature yourself but we testify there's a new birth we testify there's a c Gene of God inside of us that is not of the world that they they can claim evidence exist they can claim all day long a worldly evidence of a fallen nature and a fallen man but it's given to us to declare a Heavenly Kingdom and a righteousness that's not of this world and we can live forth the very righteousness of Jesus Christ by his blood amen no leav Isaiah 6110 through1 I will great greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with his garments of Salvation he have covered me with his robe of righteousness as a bridegroom deth himself with ornaments and a bride adorne herself with jewels for as the the Earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth things that are sown in its spring to Spring forth so the Lord will cause righteousness and praise to Spring forth before all the nations let's just meditate on that for a moment that's a beautiful scripture I will great rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me he hath clothed me in the garments of Salvation he hath covered me with Robes of righteousness you ever seen a kid try to put on their own jacket you know there's a there's a there's a need of him to be the one who's clothing Us in his righteousness there's a need of his robe of Salvation this isn't something we Adorn our ourselveses with and I would say that in if we could make ourselves a debtor to the law and we can fulfill it and we weren't an offense to one another and it was and you just fit the part and there was no reproach that we had I would say it would be more needful that our reproach be known and that we could wear his robe of righteousness than our own covering the First John 3 and9 whosoever is born of God do not commit sin for the seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God that's the difference that's the grace of God that's the love of God is the seed of God that's been placed in you and that's not something you could sew and do yourself but there's a there's a ground that's prepared your part is to Simply do the reasonable service right those are the things that you can do to keep your heart tender and that is whatever measure you're able to do do it that's a reasonable service but when you've come to the end of what you're able to do and don't stop until you find it because until you find the end of what you can do and you come into the place where you're say God I can't do it without you I have found the end I finally found where I'm lacking Lord I kept all the Commandments from my youth I've done it all I was raised in the message I always respected my Mommy and Daddy they told me what what to do and I did it but Lord I found now that your word has called me to something higher and I I can't help but be jealous I don't know what it is but you know this person does that and it just I just want what they have you know I can't help it when someone tells me they need something I just I'm a people pleaser and they make me do things that I don't want to do and I'm subject to it I can't help it God I need you and when you've done all to stand stand cuz he's on the way his his hand's not too short he's going to deliver you we preach a gospel that sharp because it's a it's a deliverance we preach a gospel that tells you you're a sinner because he forgives Sinners and he washes them in the blood of Jesus Christ and he sets them free We Don't Preach a gospel that says stay in sin we preach a gospel that tells you to do things you can't do right because we have a God that's more than able Hallelujah we preach a gospel that requires Grace we don't have a hope without Grace we don't have a doy gospel that is a Grace that's works that you've done that's turning Grace into disgrace it's a Grace that's greater than anything we could ever do it's a higher level of Grace it's a higher law it's a Higher Love This Is Spoken Word is the Original Seed now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bringing forth of its kind Genesis 1:1 the last days the church Bride Comes To The Headstone will be the Super Church a super race as it nears The Headstone so what's Grace Grace and love love crying it's crying The Headstone love Christ we're coming to the headstone this is that invisible Union this is where the Holy Ghost ghost has come up through the stature of a perfect man go ahead and uh put that up if you have it the stature of the perfect man and we're coming to what is a reflection of the very image of Christ which is summed up in one thing love the the whole image of the C I love the cabstone because it's the shape of the very pyramid itself the if you look at a Capstone it is a pyramid it's like if you're what's those gifs or whatever they just do the the uh unending Loop we should do one of the Capstone what we should do one of our technology Brothers needs to zoom in Into The Headstone and then it's the pyramid and then you zoom back into the headstone it's the pyramid it summarizes the entire body of the entire thing is made up in love the very pyramid itself could be within the Capstone the Capstone sets on top of it what does it love what what does it come in Grace Grace Grace it's the bride of Christ reflecting the very image of her husband so here's the we'll continue read in paragraph 3 352 now here's what I'm trying to say The Headstone that's they will much be much like so like him even they will be in his very image in the order to in order to be United with him they will be one they will be one they will be very manifestations of his word of the Living God denominations can never produce this this will be they will produce their breeds and dogmas and mix the word and bring a hbrd product no leav the first son was spoken seed word of God he was given a bride I'm just reviewing the spirit now I'm picking it up what I said see a bride to produce himself she fell see that's what the bride was given to produce himself again another Son of God but she fell by high breeding see produce himself but she fell caused him to die speaking of Eve now the Second Son a spoken seed word of God was given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also he's talking now about the church ages and she had been put on freom moral agency like Adam's wife was to believe God's word and live or doubt it and die and she did then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ a beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word and through them and by them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in the Virgin who knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas the Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God himself made manifest he will act himself by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill all that has been written of him he did when he came came through the Virgin wound type of the spirit wound now so that will the Virgin now accept his word be it unto me th though he said though it was said by an Angel while it yet was written word Isaiah 9:6 they will love him love his and shall have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects sub to the head headship of Christ was his notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until he seen the father or the father showed him Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride and he show her his word of life he knows her and she receives it you know depart from me I never knew you this is that now this is who is known this is how he knows his bride there's those who can do an amazing amount of works but there's a depart I never knew you this is a secret here now this is the knowing this is we've been invited into the bride chamber you know there's the there's the secret there's that invisible Union of the Bride In Christ and this is it's transpiring right here that's right I mean here's the prophet bringing to you how this invisible Union taking place it she never doubts it nothing amen then I got a great Hallelujah here is the secret the word is the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus sayith the Lord then it is germatize so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it grows and serves its purpose that's beautiful they do only his will no one can persuade them different they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill and he did complete in his days all things when he was here he did not complete all of them when he was here for it was not time yet so he's saying there's a work for the bride to do now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb and now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promis in leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua God started Israel as as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different so did the last church but were the Caleb we take the promised land we go in and we possess it and the the the union between Christ and the bride so that she has the mind of Christ and the character of Christ cries Grace Grace this the the scripture we opened with the ver the bride is saying he that you know let's just turn back and read it in Revelations 22 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come so if you've heard if you've heard the grace and the Good Tidings of the Gospel if you heard what this message did to call you out of dead formal denominationalism to call you out of a lukewarm gospel a Christianity that can stomach the things of the world that could say I can do the things of the world and claim to be a Christian I'll put the Emoji on my name I'm a Christian I I claim I love Jesus no you don't Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God isn't in you that's not our gospel we've heard a gospel that says the same thing that Jesus Christ said and he said if you do those things and you love those things you have no part of me true you know it's it's it's judgment and your sins either go before you now and you and you throw yourself on the on Christ and you say God forgive me I'm found wanting I need a savior or you dress yourself in a right a self-righteousness I love Jesus I'll just live however I want I'm going to I'll I'll I'll take a worldly identity and I'm going to bring my Christ into it I'm going to say Jesus of Nazareth the one who walked the Sea of Galilee can dress any old way can listen to any old music could could go ahead and do all these things and you're going to say that's the identity of Jesus Christ that's not the identity of Jesus Christ that was declared the same yesterday to date him forever in our day it called out against it just go listen to a tape for crying out loud has it been that long since you listen to a tape pick one up listen to it we we we we trust that people are listening to it but we don't preach it near as hard as brother Brandon preached it and we shouldn't be scared of the Bride of Jesus Christ not being able to receive it just the way he preached it have we have we changed our taste buds to the point where we can't stomach it you know it I know that it's not a closed line gospel but it sure keeps the goats out true that's right you know it'll keep the goats out it ain't going to keep the bride out now we're not perfected by the law but sometimes we just need to get the goats out because there's because it matters okay Eve listened to a word a lie of the devil that said it didn't matter and it matters it matters the way you dress it matters your Associates it matters your friends it matters the influence it matters what you're feeding on you think it's a little thing it's a little seed okay it'll it'll it goes a lot further than you want to go it matters you can't that you can't dabble in the things of the world and not be scarred you can't da you can't take a coal to your bosom and not get burnt you can't do these things and think that it doesn't matter now God will save you he's not going to lose a one but why go that way when there's a victory that could be one why go that way when it can be salvation to others you know think of this and and God help us your your position as a Son of God sure might just be well and dandy on the Lamb's Book of Life but what about those who you failed to save and reach out to that could have been the one that had the right response to something you could have said that might have been their only hope and you back boneless couldn't take stand and it could have been someone's hope to say you know what he's right what he's saying is the truth they may not have anything in them to live it but on that day that could have been the very thing that delivered him and you coward couldn't take a stand on whose lives are at stake I'm glad you're secure I'm glad you know the love of God's going to take you on your deathbed I'm glad you're compelled of the love of Christ but what are you showing the love of Christ stands with authority it stands and call Sin Sin it stands and say you can be free from that we don't have a powerless gospel it's the love of God to set you free from it God help us I've seen God take some and I'm I'm believing for him I've sat in an atmosphere show the P Pillar of Fire and the presence of God dropped down and one person had the bad response to it the other one say don't don't say that and I'm believing for that person they there something caused a response in them that wasn't them they took a stand because there was a showdown where's The Showdown happening in your life are you just selling along is there no Showdown taking place but there's got to be a showdown where the word comes and cuts our lives and we say God I'm willing to die I'm willing to give it all to you all my heart all my mind all that I am I'm willing to die and if that's not the Showdown that's taking place in our lives then we're that's not the gospel Jesus said he came to set us under and to divide to set father against mother this gospel C causes a division it causes a separation it doesn't cause a stomach that can feed on the things of the world it it it it should throw us into desperations because it is the desperation that this word causes it has to cause something that says I'm not able to do it and if we just want to pet everybody so they just kind of make it in you know it's sickening the stuff that goes on now in the name of the message in the association of the message and and and God forbid things be named amongst our young people but we're not a social gospel just because someone friends you doesn't make them a Christian you better and watch your Associates and I'm not thinking of any particular person saying that or anyone or any friend or anybody's contacts I'll tell you that but the desperations that we should have Lord help us I don't think I read this this is in the marriage of the Lamb someday as I look towards the setting of The Sun 31 years ago made a pledge somehow lost every handkerchief if I had I didn't know how I did that but here we go someday as I look forward to setting the sun 32 years ago made a pledge see these tissues on a McGary nose they just shred so got to have some cotton the one that I loved All My Love to him I've always tried to hold up for him in his word wherever I go I know there's many other setting here like that waiting for the day that when this Old Ship isign shall come into Port pick up our souls and take us to the presence of him who we love and his pledge our love too there may be some in here tonight who's never made that pledge there may be some that's made it and broke it if you're in that condition tonight friend you don't have to just come back tonight and renew your pledge if you haven't make it why don't you come and make it tonight say Lord Jesus I love you remember if you've already made your pledge and still mingle with the things of the world Jesus will not have a bride like that he will not have one that's adulterous All Your Love must be to him and if you love the things of the world and the Fashions of the world better than you love God then you have not made yourself ready is that person in here tonight while you have your heads bowed would you raise up your hand and say brother brand and pray for me I do not want to be that way I do I want to be a part of the Bride I know I'm doing things I shouldn't do pray for me God bless you my Indian sister God bless you and you my brother and you my brother anyone else raise up your hand pray for me brother brandom I know I'm not right now be honest with yourself look back at your life you have to look back before you can go forward look what you have been look what spirit that you've got has made you if you haven't if you Proclaim to be a Christian and you still mingle with the things of the world brother sister you can but be blind if you don't see that you're wrong so you're blind if you can mingle with the world and the things of the world you're blind I counsel you to by isev that you can see get in the presence of a holy God know the right not an anointing not an outpouring but know that you've met Jesus Christ himself and the love of Jesus Christ for yourself and you tell me if those things are in that presence you you'll have no need of any man to teach you anything when your eyes come open and you can they can be opened in his presence said glad they had that up someone said the other day said brother brandom you ought to leave off the people like that said people call you a prophet I said I'm not a prophet but said people think you are you ought to be teaching these women instead of telling them to wear long hair and the right kind of clothes and things like that you ought to be telling them how to be to get spiritual things isn't that something that's that's that that's that charismatic that's that Pentecostalism that's that lack of understanding that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and and we should be darome ourselves to think just because we can get an anointing get the moving of the spirit have even gifts that we could operate in our lives that somehow there's a way of Escape it it's false Doctrine you're blind you're blind I said how can I teach them algebra when they won't learn even take ABCs the kindergarten haven't you even haven't even got the decency to clean themselves up calling the bride of Christ I'm not saying that irritable I'm saying that in Godly love so now we're understanding what God's love is God's Love's corrective and as I said this morning if you see you going down the river in a boat and you see you're going to hit the falls and the boat won't take it me screaming at you and hollering at you and I'm trying to hurt you I love you because if you don't your life will be lost is there anyone is there another one raise up your hands before we pray I see you back there ain't that amen who even knows if he saw him with the natural eye but he sees you you don't it you know the the smallest desperate cry he hears if it's a cry in faith and it's a cry in the heart he hears that cry you may not even raise your hand physically but something in your heart can go lord it's me I want more and that's that seed Gene of God that he put in you and he's drawing it God there's something wrong somewhere look at you out in the rooms out there raise up your hand say pray me brother brandom God bless you that's right honest to goodness I admire sincerity that's what's the trouble with the Pentecostal church today we might as well just put all our names there we haven't got the real sincerity we used to have we haven't got the audacity to come and say admit we're wrong the devil has just got so much hold on the church until it's just wallowing in the muck of the world don't do that your own life proves that you haven't got what you say and you got then why not confess it he will confess his sin shall be pardoned he that hides his sin shall not Prosper you can't hide it God knows all about it if you see and know what you're not living right then why not confess it and come out and let it be be clear some people sins go before them some follow let mine go before let me tell all of mine right now Lord God get it right that's what I ought to do that's my prayer Lord I I want to be right I want my heart right this message has come to to restore a heart with that heart of Faith a heart to believe all things that possible a heart to believe that I'm the very image of God that I'm declaring his righteousness and I don't want any worldly ISM attached to it he loved me so much to identify with me and my shame he loved me enough that the stubborn person I was I remember a time it was the Crystal's Pizza I don't even know if anyone Liv lived in this town longer long enough to remember Crystal's Pizza anyone all right Crystal's Pizza it was this pizza joint and I think over in Irving off MacArthur it had this nice Blinky sign out front and it was really cool inside had arcades it had uh bowling things had a Sunday bar you can go get your Sunday and you could put all the toppings on it you wanted and my family would go there periodically maybe every now and then a Friday and the musicians could come I'm going to try to wrap up and I probably should have looked up the year at close because it probably given me an idea of how old I was but I imagine I was maybe six seven eight years old and something happened where I wasn't going to go in it was a hot Friday evening and the rest of the family went in and I stayed in the back of that station wagon and I was so stubborn I sat in there for the two hours that they were in there I wasn't going to go in I wasn't going to relent whatever it was in my thinking I can't remember what it was but I was hurt enough that even though they wanted me to go in and everybody's like you know come in you're going to have a good time just come in Let It Go I wasn't going to let it go I sat in that van it was I think it was actually a station wagon and I was just stubborn and that's the nature I have even when God would entreat me show me things I had nothing to even help myself my stubborness was even bigger than I was but I do remember another time I went out to a van I believe it was tape meetings in Little Rock Arkansas Hot Springs Arkansas they were playing a tape at a at a YMCA Center and my father came out to me I wasn't in the service I was running around and go ahead and play he touched me I guess I just don't want you sitting there maybe I wanted you to have a closer view but the grace of God that that found me in that moment I went out to the van and I started to pray I said God if you could being there you could be out here too I don't even think I understood even what I was praying I couldn't comprehend what was about to transpire I don't even know what led me to that van to sit there and to say that prayer but the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ came in that van and he changed me and everything that I was in that moment changed I knew a presence that was the love of God projected to me you didn't need to tell me what wasn't pleasing I didn't want to do anything to disturb that atmosphere I wanted it to abide with me forever it wasn't even long after that offence came Satan's always trying to trouble that atmosphere of the Lord L and the Holy Spirit in you it's a dove it's a home loving bird it wants to take Roost it wants to be there and we do things that cause an offense we do things that shock the atmosphere and all we have to do is really get the love back get the atmosphere right the holy spirit's there to lead and guide us in all truth and righteousness he's not leaving us to ourselves you don't have to do this alone but you could ask God to come and pilot the ship you could ask him to be the power in the engine you could ask him to be your sight you could ask him to be your guide and anything any thinking contrary to that you could say Lord I want to die to that I recognize it's there I put it before me and I ask Lord that it would be dead at Calvary let's just stand together and let's sing that song and just in your heart I wasn't in a church service when that happened I was in a van by myself years later I'd be in a park and I would say it's a perfect type of man and wife in Christ in the church and the presence of God would drop down again and many times in my life in the presence of the Lord has dropped down and it hasn't been in church so you don't have to be here but I will say as you're in an atmosphere Believers ones who could say what he's done for me he could do for you and as we would incline our hearts as Believers that God would you touch one that doesn't know you that if you would incline your heart to him he could do that for you where our strength is gone where our strength is not able he's the Difference Maker gracious Heavenly Father Lord none of us by ourselves has a righteousness and we're all transgressors Lord the very things that I've spoken of Lord you know the times in my life I failed to take a stand I failed to Proclaim My Love For You Lord in action or deed and or maybe I've even done things that partook of things that didn't show forth your glory Lord in the love that you've shown me Lord and He who's been forgiven much we're debtors of much father Lord what a greater love we should show Lord I want to show forth a greater praise and a greater love through a righteous life through a holy life through a clean life through one that doesn't dabble in the world or partake of the things of the world Lord that doesn't bring a reproach upon your name father ask you to forgive me where I've come short of that Lord David would even pray for the iniquities he knew not Lord I I'd say in my mind I can't even comprehend the depths of your righteousness Lord what is man that you're mindful of him Lord that you would even come down and visit us with a holy presence Lord but Purge our minds once again father take all of our hearts once again Lord Lord we give ourselves to you a fresh just rededicating ourselves oh God asking Lord the grace and the grace and the grace that was cried out this morning father would be effectual Lord it would show forth a love a love for you God a love that's greater than the things of the world oh God lord for it's your promise to us Lord and we're subject to that you're our head to you we give the glory the precious name of our Lord and

display you want to live a life that when people look at you they see the grace of Jesus Christ you want when people ask you a question what makes you what you are what makes you so different you can
