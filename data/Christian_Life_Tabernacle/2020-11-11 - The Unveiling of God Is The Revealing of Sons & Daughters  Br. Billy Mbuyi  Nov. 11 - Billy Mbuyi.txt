Just Praise you all day long Lord praise you when we work up and praise you when we go out father that our very life may just be a praise unto your name and the things that you have done Lord we're so fortunate to be Gather in your presence in your house Lord I know we say that often time but the hours coming where we can even within our own selves come to that realization that we are very fortunate group of people and we ask tonight father that you may speak to us through your word Lord we have come with desires and needs within our heart and Lord we believe that the god who's called us the god who's placed us at this place and who made a way that we could be gathered tonight that he has in his word a promise that if we believe it that he would come and bring his word to come to pass in our lives Lord for every need that's represented in this room Lord I know that you are the creator of Heaven and Earth and there's nothing that escapes you I pray that you come and you answer to every need oh God and as the word Goes Forth father that it may that you may just so become so big that our problems will just become so little and ins insignificant that we may just realize in whose pres presence we are standing and all our needs will be answered because you are the creator of Heaven and Earth speak to us through your word for we have need of it we commit everything to your hands Lord I pray that you just touch my lips tonight Lord to just put your words in my mouth Lord that I may speak only what you would like for me to speak father that our ears may only hear your word and nothing else we commit everything we are to you and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so good to be gathered in the house of God Amen let's just open our Bibles sudden you want to welcome everyone uh who's here those that are home streaming we welcome you to in the presence of the Lord and pray that uh something will be said tonight that will be of help to all of us amen uh let's turn our Bibles let's open to uh Romans chapter uh 8 a very familiar scripture reading we're going to start from verse [Applause] 14 Romans 8 and4 it says for as many as I led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again for fear but ye have received the spirit of the adoption where where we cry whereby we cry ABA father it said the spirit itself Beth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then HS of God and join air with Jesus if so be that this that we suffer with him and we shall that we may be also glorified together it says for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of of of the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but the reason of him who had subjected the same in hope now I want you to realize what he said the creature was made subject to vanity not by his own will but that's how it was made it says because the the the create the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God and I so like this I I'll just Paul is continually just reminding us the children of God the children of God the children of God it said for we know that the whole creation grown and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruit of the spirit even we also grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body he said for we are saved by hope but hope that is not seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do where why they do does he hope for for if we hope for what we see we see not then we do with patience wait for it likewise the spirit also helped our infirmities for we know for we know not what we should pray for as we ought as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groaning which cannot be uttered thank you Lord and He that searcheth the heart knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and then he says and we know that all things work together for good for them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did forne he also did he predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son and that he might be the first be be the firstborn among many Brethren it says more over whom did he he did predestinate them he also called whom he called then he also Justified whom he justify them he also glorify what shall we say of these things if God be for us who could be against us let's also turn to one more scripture reading in Philippians um chapter 2 chapter 2 he says if there be if there if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit any bows of Mercy fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love uh being of one Accord and one mind let not let not let nothing be done through strive of V Glory but in lonliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own thing on his own things but every man on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus whom being in a form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto to death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every that the name of Jesus every knee should bow all things in heaven and things on earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen father we ask you bless your word to us we commit ourselves to your hands in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may have your seats amen we'll try not to be too long tonight but am man just have a a little thought in on our mind and we'll give you the title as we move along um I was just thinking about some of the things that our pastor has been talking about um even about the time that we're living in and what uh a time where a faithless generation like the scriptures calls it a faithless generation where man has rejected faith and embraced uh science and and you begin to look uh we can uh look at the Bible and we know butam say says often and and and so many times it would say that you know if I was asked in what age I would live in this is the age and this is the age and yet we sit here we look at the wickedness that's around us we look at just the confusion and all those things and and and what we need to come to the realization is uh uh to an unbeliever this is scary this is the scariest condition that you can ever be that's why people are Marching and and fighting and all kinds of things because this that's all they have but to the believer it's a glorious time because it's a glorious time because this is the Fulfillment of scripture this is the Fulfillment of Prophecy we can look at the world's condition and come together tonight and say that we can look outside and say that today this scripture is fulfilled and everything that's playing out there everything that we look out there that's happening it's happening exactly according to the prophecy that was given at the end time if you think about people and and and and the nature and and the way people are acting and I was talking about David uh the other day I said I was so amazed even as you was reading those things I was following uh one of the speeches that the the president-elect gave and everything and one of the the point that he wanted to make was that we and I'm just paraphrasing it they says that we will follow science whatever science tells us to do that's what we're going to do whatever this experts this educated people whatever they come up with whatever they tell us to do that's what we're going to do in other words science has become their God and I thought about there's another group of people who have not taken science and and God is their God faith is what they've been given for them to walk by it's not because we realize that this world was not framed by science science can take it and tell you that this is this many years old this is this you can put this together and do that but we understand the scripture tell us it was by the word of God that this was put together so we can come to a place and we begin to realize you know the the the the world out there is is making history United stat has made history this is the first elected woman of color and a woman in the position of Vice President you can look at that people are rejoicing over those things and realize that how that this uh with they're making advance ments they can claim they're making great achievement but we realize as even as our Pastor said as the world is making his achievement we need to pay attention to the achievement that God is making these things are not just happening over the blue and we just look and say we are a people that have been warned that have been given a word for us to look at what's happening out there and be able to look at the word of God and say that this today is the scripture being fulfilled and as this is happening I need to look at what is my portion in the word what is my portion in the scripture because as that is being fulfill God is also fulfilling something God is not sitting on the sideline God is fulfilling his word and and we we know we don't have a portion with what's happening out there but it's a portion for us in the scripture for us to also fulfill so we could see uh how that they they put their hearts and they put everything that they have in in science and they're hoping that they can come up with a way for them uh uh to make life better they always try to improve they a home that was built 10 years ago the home that's built today they make Improvement by science they do it better they achieve it they go forward and they do all those things and the prophet tells us perhaps I'll don't know if I'll get time to get to it but it tells us all the achievement of science all of it amounts to death there's everything you can take everything that science can achieve all of that amounts to nothing but death there's nothing that it can bring outside of death and the only thing that can bring life is the word of Mighty God and that's why we could sit here rejoice and say that we are people that have received the word of mighty God we have received the word that is been allotted for our generation and by receiving that word we can produce life amen you you look at the the the the systems of the economy our Pro Pastor talked about the systems how that they have a system of Education that's been carried over and that same system is been even reproduced in the church and all those things you you look at the system you can look at the economy on average every 10 years it has to crash if you go look at it every 10 years it has to crash and as it crash they come and they put and they they fix it and they bring it back up and and you could be sure within 10 another 15 years it's going to crash again and that's the best that men can produce that's the best system that they can come up with they can come up today they'll give you medicine tomorrow they'll give you something a medicine that's better than what they give you before and they're making achievement and they're trying to advance but we realize that God has a system that need no improvement God has a system it was perfect from the day it was spoken and that system is his word you eat his word you shall live you reject his word you die and that system is perfect and God has never come down to say well I need to improve my system because the way I created it it wasn't perfect it's been perfect from day one it's perfect today and it's that same because the scripture tells us that heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away so God's system is what we want to hang on to tonight brother speaks in the message uh the unfailing uh his unfailing word of a promise the his unfailing words of Promise he speaks and he says in paragraph 34 he says well and another thing he says every 2,000 years something has to happen on Earth he says and the politics and everything gives out God has to send help from Heaven and the first 2,000 years the world was destroyed with with water the second 2,000 years Christ came and in 1964 and they claim we it says we are about 17 years short of that so every 2,000 years something happened every 2,000 years the world come to an end every the as it says this first one the first 2,000 years God came and destroyed the world with the flood and and he came and we're realizing after that Christ came and he poured off his blood on on the earth and so that we could go on but then we realize that the same Earth will be judged and it will be destroy with fire and we live in the time where the Earth will be destroyed with fire he says in the message the world is falling apart again it says the world has met has met its Doom every 2,000 years we know the system has has fell apart it Fells apart it says it fell apart in the day of Noah the day of Christ it fall apart and here comes again it repeats 1964 does it it says what does it live it says uh 30 36 years to another 2,000 year to another uh to another 2,000 the the 21st century the 21st century coming up what happened the work it says the work still has to come still has to be cut short Jesus says the corruption of this day the elect will be deceive if he wouldn't be if he if he wouldn't be saved if it would be possible it says there you are and the calendar tells us according to science what we about 15 15 years off of that we are behind on the Roman Calendar according to the Jewish calendar that we are about 15 it says 20 uh we are 15 or 20 years behind on that it says so where are we at we see Nations breaking Israel Awakening the signs that the Bible for foretold for this day we see the mechanic things taking place now it says now the spirit the dynamic of the promised word to get into his into his church and drive them to Calvary under to the Rapture and there we are yeah so it's it's it's when this is happening that God in this time is bringing his Dynamic into his church in order for him to bring us into a place where we could go into the Rapture is when this conditions are seen out there when we can uh uh uh look at the world out there and realize that this is exactly what was prophesied you know I was telling Brother David out there it's amazing where you know you you you you have people that have left this message and they claim you because it's not true because they didn't uh they couldn't find any historical record of a bridge that fall or they couldn't uh uh testify of something that somebody said and all of those things but yet there's a group of people every time they read the message it becomes so real every time they look at the news they read the news and everything that every time they look at the events that's happening out there they can't help but see the word of God coming to pass every time they're turn around every time they read a quote it makes the world it looks at everything that's happening there it makes it so crisp and clear it makes it so to such a place where there's doubt and it's peeling off the doubt from the heart it's increasing the Revelation it's bringing to them to a place where that rapturing Faith giv strengthening up it's bringing them to a place where they know that this word is the real word of Mighty God what a contrast you know the difference is in death there was nothing to believe it with but in you God has placed something that when you see the word come to pass there's something within your heart that desire to see the god manifested there something within your heart that looks at the word and God reveals himself too and I want to say this God hides himself but one them tells us it's in God's nature to hide himself but he says he hides himself to the unbeliever and he reveals himself to the believer he reveals himself to those that seek to know those that wants to know those that wants to see him oh so we would see Jesus some of them looked at him and called him be elab some of them looked at him and they said this is the son of Mary and Joseph some of them looked at him this is the son of a carpenter but all when the elected on saw him when when those that were called saw him when they looked at him they saw God at the same exact person one group looked at him they call him all kinds of name but the other group looked at him they said that this is the who are who do you say this man is he says you are the son of the Living God and he looked at him and he says flesh and blood has not revealed that to you amen God is not known by science God is not known by intellectual understanding God is known by revelation God is known by him and Revelation is not something that you dig yourself into you study the word of God so much and then you receive Revelation Revelation is a gift of God God so loved the world he will come that he will choose you he will choose an individual and he will deposit something within them that they will believe his word with it has nothing to do with the individual it has everything to do with God thank you Lord Jesus he says right the very thing that created I want you to listen to this this is the same message the world just Fallen apart it says no it says no wonder we are falling apart there's nothing he says the very thing that created the Earth the very the very thing that we put that that was put here from for for the earth to turn on the very thing that systems and everything else was to revolve around the word of God by God he framed the world it says Einstein said this there's only one explanation of the scripture only one explanation of the world being in existence he said in Hebrews 11 he says by faith it says by faith we understand the World by the word of God by the word of God that the world were framed together by the word by the word of God that's all there's no one that can tell how it hangs there in the air or how it could turn around and make the 20 uh and make its 20 uh 24 hours around the equator or so forth like that or around the orbit anywhere come back in the same spot it says never misses a second every Star turning in its cycle like that it says helping one another as they go around no one can tell you that amen no one can tell you how perfectly and all they know is if any of it if any of it will come out of the orbit if any of it will stop doing what it's doing the whole world will cramble but yet they can't explain what dynamic what force and what just puts it together so it can function the way it's functioning right amen so I was like I said I was thinking about some of the things our pastor talked about and and I just got some quy I would like for us to read uh to just go over and and some of the things it's been talking about in focus to science it says science has a tree that they that they can climb he says but they can only climb so far and then that's as far as they can go that's the end of science research they kill themselves that's right yes sir that's that's the end of science they kill themselves it says but ye but it says but you see uh on the other tree on the tree of Faith there's no end to it you can just go on that's the tree where we should be on tonight the Tree of Life the tree of faith it says not headed towards the mo or towards the heaven or headed towards God but headed towards God for the Glorious Rapture of the Lord Jesus in his presence in his power is every life out of Heaven not coming down not making us join church not coming down even to make even even to make us shout but but coming down to let his whole life live through us now I want you to hold on to that because we're come back to it what what what this Faith is doing is for the I'm not talking about a partial Life of Christ I'm not talking about a measure of Life of Christ but so that his whole life remember the scripture says that the works that I do ye shall do also and and often time we look and you know say well some of the same word but I want to say this tonight that God has reserved certain works that even he himself when he was in the body of Jesus did not do right that he reserved those works so that only you and I can do those works so when I say the works that I do it's the same Christ doing the same works but he's in a different flesh it's the same Christ doing the same works but he in a different form it's the same God when we say you know often time you get amazed we say oh we come here to church what two or three I gather on my name I'm in the midst and then and then we look at one another we begin to look Perhaps it is in the air or somewhere no it's the same works it's the same God and the same God where is he is in you when you say we two or three I got to my them I'm in the midst it's because you have brought him here it's not because when we go out of here God doesn't remain in the empty building this is not his place of dwelling we bring him here and we go out with him God is in his people [Applause] just getting ahead of myself now so so he says live and Heavenly live in the Heavenly carry out yourself till you see things that is to come that were things that is to come was which is and shall come lifted up above anything that the church has since since the day that Christ was on Earth and you are enjoying it today sure we are we are in a great age friends a great time an astronaut age God give us astronauts give us men and women daring men daring wom did you know John Glenn them he says them to and them have to do what uh did you know that John Glenn and them have to do with them they stepped into the bubble they were Pioneers he says what God he says what God wants what God wants God wants Pioneers to his word astronaut who will take the things which have got which have gotten not be satisfied with it but going on God is making achievement Amen in other words the things which have been promised the things which have been made known the things which we know are in store for us God is looking for man and woman that will take those things and run with it he's looking for Pioneers you say well you know this has never happened God wants to do it by you no man has never done this before now I tell you that that first man had to have inspiration and has to have something within their heart for them to be the first to do it you know Mary didn't know about anybody who's had a baby without meeting a man right in the time of Lazarus there was never such thing as a dead man who who started his body started to corrupt who stood up and who was raised they didn't know about those things but yet there were Believers there were those that had faith and there were those and in us but the scripture tells us that Enoch as he came as a type of the Rapture in other words the reason why Enoch was in the Bible was just so that when we come to this age that we can make a reference to something that God had already done so we can know that as he done it he's going to do it again and if he had not done it before and he's promis it in his word that same God is able to bring it to pass why because it's his word in the message conflict between God and Satan it says but sons of God they stay humble they stay away from such thing as and the relieve upon God knowing that they were going to inherit all things all things in the earth now I I just jumped I want you to see the characterization that he's giving even as we we heard that message set in Z and he says notice this Mar educated Canaanites woman Canaanites woman it says for Canaanite line married The Humble peasant boys of Seth he says and they came and there became and there became Giants and and were renowned we find out that they became great scientists great workers of wood great art it says great smart educated people and they had a great economy they lived in such scientif scientifical age until they buil pyramid that we couldn't build today they build uh uh uh uh fs and many things uh many marks and and and they seen in the rocks in in SS of time that we couldn't produce today because those people leaned upon on their knowledge and became scientist and smart man and renowned man yes and we are told that's going to be repeated it says so people today they are smart they've got all this they do all is so much smarter than we was it says we are we are so smarter than we are we are we are so smart ra uh farther away from God than we were you draw yourself right away all right so in other word here we are we we could say it's the most scientifical age that there was and yet we find out that with science the science that we have man is drawing far and farther away from God we have all kinds of medicine that there is but people are sicker than there ever was we have the greatest economy that there was but yet people are the poorest there were in in in any time we have the greatest this but yet it's not producing in other words man was not science was not supposed to be given as the answer to men's need the men's need was to be answered by the word of God by faith in his word that God was intending to produce it that's listen to this I thought this was he says we find out that in the field today that there are so many things we say we find out that the medical the the medical doctor will say we said to the to to The Surge about the surgeon you don't need a man that can cut you in pieces that can cut you to pieces you don't need you don't need an operation he's nothing but a saw so now that's a medical doctor talking about the surgeon it says then the surgeon will come around and say you don't need a medical a medical doctor sugar pill you need an operation there you are we find the Chiropractic will say about the ASO astropath it says you don't need to you you need a rub on your back you you don't need an adjustment of the bone isn't that amazing yeah you know I I remember I I had a I had my I woke up one day my eyes were just bloodshot and it was just hurting and and so I call one of those tell doctors you you call you know remotely and and it came because the the the the doctor's office the the the eye doctor office was closed so he looked at it and he prescribed an antibiotics so I took it and he was not an eye doctor it was just a generalist so I went and I took it I put it for a couple of days scheduled an appointment went in there and then so I sat down and we began to talk I said yeah I just started a couple of days ago I started to put this he looked at it and says don't ever put that in your eyes he said you'll mess up your eyes with that and I'm looking I'm like so he they want the one told me one thing and the other tells me another thing you go this one it will tell you one thing the other how can not come together but listen to what it says it says it says you don't you don't you and and then the astropath will say you don't need a chiropractor you don't you don't need to you don't you don't want your your neck uh you don't want your neck broken your muscles are tight just adjusted but it says but all of them will say the preacher is a quack the one thing that they all can agree on they cannot agree with one another this one will say I have the best medicine the other one will say I know the way to get you to to get you better this one will send you to a specialist The Specialist will look at you and say I'm going to do this and this you go to another specialist they have a different way you know I I remember I went to a dentist I went and I I I got there they looked at me and say well you know we got to remove this too and not then count about five or six I'm like you know can I just get my tooth clean I'll come back later and then I went and then the next time I decided to go to another one and I go they pick up different teeth than the other one picked I looked at it I said what's going on here so I realized that even and I can say this tonight even within this uh uh knowledge of man there's an economy built behind it when you go to a doctor they got to make money when you go I remember I bring my son to the hospital you know you show up at the emergency room they got to run you through every machine that building is God before they can tell you that there's nothing wrong it's the way it's built that's the system and you tell a man to put his life to rely on that system people do it all the time oh but I'm here to tell you God has a system the system of a man will fail you the system of man is going to is nothing but death but God has a system tonight and it's been right since day one and that system will bring you healing that system will bring you Deliverance that system will provide for you every step of the way and when he done with you that system will take you into Rapture that's the system we need to rely on don't let the word of God Fall by the wayside don't believe what some men because they have a robe what they tell you then you believe him you trust in what God Said and God will vindicate his word all of them can agree on one thing a preacher is a crack that's the only thing that can bring them together so it continues on and in the Great Commission it says it says it says it takes God to it says now it says Brethren you see uh it's something it's says I just want to uh I just want to justify in saying this it's it's a selfish motive it continues on we know the surgeon help we know that the medicine helps we know the chiropractor the astropath pathic it says we know all that helps we know and and then after all it takes God to do the healing regardless of what comes or goes whether it's the surgeon whether it's the medical doctor whether it's a chiropractor it takes God to do the healing God is the only one that can heal there never was a drop of medicine that can ever heal a man or mental balance that that man ever said if he says if he did I could just show you for in a minute it says how foolish it is there's only one Healer and that's God it says and and and as the whole Christian armor is absolutely Supernatural there's nothing natural it can prove it says and I can prove that God there's no more need of Faith but God God but he that cometh to God must believe that he is by faith the whole Christian armor is by faith the whole way we make things happen the whole way things that are not in existence come into existence the whole way that we live and if you as you woke up this morning I tell you you may think you didn't have faith but it's faith that woke you up it's faith that got you in the car it's faith that took you to work it's faith that done all of that you may not realize you have it inside of you but it's faith that does all of those things and if you aband in it it's death amen now let me just skip here and get to my thought what I want to speak tonight I just want to give you what what I what this from those things that I spoken my heart has been on the message the Mighty God unveiled before us the Mighty God unveiled before us and and I want to give you my title is the unveiling of God is the revealing of sons and daughters the unveiling of God is the revealing of sons and daughters but now when you talk about andam speaks about in this message he talks about God he says it was he says that God uh uh men always wanted to know where they came from what are they doing doing here and what the purpose on Earth was and where they're going and then he he he makes a he makes a comment he says but there's only one that can tell him but there's only one that can answer that question and there the one who brought him here and it says that so the the desire is to know the purpose of the existence and the one who can answer to the purpose of the existing is the one who brought you here so he speaks in this message and we know it very well he talks about the great drama he talks about the great drama he talks about how that this little girl went into the school and they talked about this uh uh they had a drama in the school now the word drama is is is a composition of verse or Pros presenting a story in a pandemic uh uh uh in a in a dialogue and it contain conflict of characters particularly one whom perform in the front of the audience in the stage the the person who writes the drama uh is for the stage uh direction is known as a a dramatist so I want you to know so there has to be some conflict when you talk about drama there cannot be drama without conflict so there some uh uh if I could say some nail-biting moment something that just seems like it may go wrong and and something and all of that is done for the purpose of creating the drama and all of those things and I want to say this everything that's happening in the world is a drama everything that's happening in our life is a drama and I and I began to think about this if men of the earth could write the drama and they will have people as actors and you hire actors and to have them to play play different role but when them talks about one kid who played about five different parts and and all those things they come and they play this roles so that at the end they can come up and bring the story perfectly I want to say this if God was to unfold the drama he's going to use real character amen God is not using just some actors or something in his drama if man can do the same God can come and he's using real character God created the devil God created the heavens and the Earth in the threefold purpose bam tells us that God wanted to reveal himself it was something that was within his heart so he has to create this thing he has to create create this environment that he can let this drama play out now he didn't let it just play all smoothly where everything seems to be secure and everything and all of that he included some drama into it he included some nail biting moment where something looks like oh my God it's lost no he had it under control why before the drama can continue before the drama can even start God In His Infinite mind as he was writing the drama and writing the character he secure every single one of those character so that when the drama will play nothing will be lost I tell you when when when the devil came and caused Eve to fall he may have thought that he done something to win hear me thought that was a nail biting moment you look this is the creation of God and now they were created in heaven and now they Fallen apart and and the whole thing is Crum but oh I tell you is a mighty God he's the creator of Heaven and Earth nothing goes past him nothing has escaped his understanding and I tell you we live in this earth and this is where I just want to get to you tonight for you to know when as we sit here we are part of God's drama and it's not even in the sense where it's us trying to play a part no but it's God trying to use your flesh in order to play a part it's God because remember he was the creation of all but whatam says that God hides himself and he reveals himself to the believer he says when he came to job God now I I wonder if you could just see this it's the unveiling of God but yet the prophet continue to talk about how God is veiling himself it's the veiling of God but yet he continues he says when he came to job he was in the form of the worldwind God was in the Whirlwind when he came and when he came he says Moses wanted to see him he says that God hi and Moses saw the back part of of a man and brother makes it clear he says he did not see God he saw the veil of God he did not see God but he saw the veil of God and I just want to encourage us tonight the world may go by the wayside as we see it but all of that is part of God's big drama all of Doubt there could be some nail biting moment where you think I'm about to lose this I don't understand this pressure comes up and down and all those things but in all of that God is bringing up his word to come to pass what ROM says he says now he says Dr scoffield he says we find that in his word in it says the word changing form we find out that in morphe in Greek which means the Unseen was made visible something something that cannot we know we know that we we know it's there it cannot be seen but yet we know it's there and when it changes its form and it Mor which means to change it changes form from the supernatural to the Natural and it changed his mask in otherwise it's like a drama he was acting and in the Greek when you when when when they when they would when they would change his M his mask they may have one play One play might might have act in several different play he says now if you are if you would not if you would take the Old Testament prophecy concerning what the Messiah was and you would compare it to the life of Jesus you've got exactly who Jesus was he was just not an orinary man he was God in morphe he was he was changed from the supernatural into the natural and yet he was God manifested In the Flesh veil in human fleshly Veil and then it says and and and and and and you watch the Old Testament like it speak in I'm speaking of a mixup audience from a different part of the world we are here to find out what are we going uh what are we doing where are we and what's getting where are we getting to what's happening what does all of this mean that's the question we have what what are we doing what's happening what's happening all over you find out it's part of what God is trying to achieve in this generation he said that when God all that God was he poured into Christ he says it's not an empty out of himself that God took something that was in him and he emptied out no he changed the form from what it was into something different and in this end time it was promised that when we see what we see out there that in that time God will take what he is he will take what he was or what he was in Christ and he will pour it into his church and God will become his own Sons and Daughters amen it's not us trying to please God oh God I want no it's the part that God was in your flesh that God came and used your flesh for the purpose of manifesting something that he couldn't do when he was in the body of Jesus that he wants to do in your flesh he wants to go talk to your neighbor he wants to go and talk to your coworker he wants to go and talk to your family and he knows we within the Flesh of Jesus he cannot who's who's this MDC he was the same God but when he came to Abraham he couldn't come in the body of Jesus because the body was not there God made a body so he can come and do a work and go by but it was the same one says when he was in Christ he was the same God God he didn't change we don't sit here as well you know I I I somehow have a desire that I can become or please God if the scripture tells us that either you were with him if you have the Holy Spirit or if you have eternal life you are with him in the beginning so as of part of this unfolding of his drama he's making his word come to pass amen I tell you Brothers and Sisters Let's Embrace God's drama he's doing it for a purpose that we don't understand he's doing it for reasons that sometimes we fail but one thing that we can know for sure that as we look in his word he's revealing his word one by one he's making it known to us he's making it known to us why he's the writer of the drama and he's the one playing the characters but when I'm talks about that violin he said it was just looked like nothing and is as some insignificant amount and nobody will take it but he said when the master came and he took of that violin and he began to play it he said it brought out the value of that what that was and God is the one bringing the value out out of you and I let's embrace the drama let's it could be some nail biting moment I was thinking about it I begin to think think about just going to uh with Moses but what says that God the scripture tells us that God hardened the heart of pharaoh he sent Moses but yet he hardened the heart of pharaoh what use is that you sent me to go tell him to let your people go but yet that same person you harden his heart he came back and he came back and and when time was come that same God came and he tell him he said him you go and you apply the blood this is going to be the final plag and after this has happened they'll let you go I want you he came and he did all of that that came and I want you I want you to remember standing before the Red Sea you talk about nail biting moment yeah is the army of pharaoh just coming and ready just getting ready to slay them just getting ready it says we got them in sight we're going to get them and yet they are standing and there's a red sea and they begin to murmur oh God you let let us tired why did you not leave us in there and they say all kind of things God performing his drama God letting his drama play out I tell you it was not a second late he opened the Red Sea and they walked by and they began to walk they didn't run they began to walk and God was taking care of it I thought about the Hebrew children you talk about drama yeah they are and they prayed and perhaps you would think that God will get them out at the last second no he didn't he let them go he let them just just about to walk in in fact they came and the people that were holding them died you talk about nail biting moment that's the truth but that's all part of God's trama you know your life you could be sick or you could be going through some things and you said I think I can't take another breath and I think this is just the end of me and that's all I think I can can't take it anymore that's part of God drama for what glory is it going to be if it's just an easy thing God wants to dramatize it he wants to bring the glory out of it he wants just to bring it and make it big so that when you go through you can say he's a mighty God he not just the might God is a mighty God he's the creator of Heaven and Earth he wrote that play he knew what character you would play and he knew exactly what role you're going to be fulfilling let's all stand tonight if we could just rejoice in God's play say God I know it's hard I don't understand this the world is gr by the word side and it's just sometime so a place that I just can't grasp it but Lord one thing I know is you have it in control it's part of your great drama that you are playing you're playing your drama you're inviting your sons and daughters I tell you those kids those Hebrew children when they get out every man looked at them and they knew they had a God who was real no one questioned them anymore about their God and I tell you my brother my sister your life testifies of that God that's what we identify with that's the thing that we know that's the thing you think about science I want you to put on one side the achievement of science I want you to put the achievement of faith on the other side tell you the achievement of science there's not too many the best they can do what an astronaut that's the best they can do it goes up and come down but what I'm says they couldn't even create a blade of grass a blade of grass all of that knowledge couldn't even amount to creating a blade of grass but all this Mighty God is here doing wonderful things I tell you how are you going to go in the Rapture he has to take you through some drama some nail biting moment some place where you think I don't know how this is going to play out but what he's the Mighty God unveil before us and where is it today is in your flesh why because that's theam says it speaks about the woman as well he says that she noticed that he metant the scripture qualification you take what that was and it says and what he did he says you come up with the Messiah you take the promised word of this hour and you put it together with the experience that we have seen you come up with a bride it's not just words there has to be something that shows that God has com and he manifest himself amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father your goodness is more than we can tell father [Music] your Prophet says that you took Noah and you put him in a scientific age within non- scientifical message something that they would just look at and just laugh at but Lord that was just part of your drama that you were doing we ask today that you lead us you guide us in all truth and righteousness father we may get nervous doing something intense moment we may get to a place where we just seem like all of it is Fallen but Lord we think we are assured is by your word you said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will never pass away we're so thankful for the things that you do and how you do it because surely we can attribute all of that to you we ask that you touch each and everyone tonight father wherever we are father that you come and meet us Lord we commit everything to you and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's just sing it as we invite
