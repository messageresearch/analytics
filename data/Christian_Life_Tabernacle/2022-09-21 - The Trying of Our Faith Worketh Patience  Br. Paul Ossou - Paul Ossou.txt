Description:
The Trying of Our Faith Worketh Patience
Br. Paul Ossou
September 21, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

bibles [Music] we're going to read a very familiar scripture in hebrews 11. we'll of the cell connector now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report let's also turn to the book of james james chapter 1 i'll let brother billy read directly we'll read verse 2 to 4 he said my brethren count it all joy when you fall in diverse temptation knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patients have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and the entire wanting nothing good lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seeds i believe we're happy to be in the house of god tonight the lord is placed on my heart this little thought [Music] that i i i i took after after the reading of the book of james proved i want to entitle it that the trying of our faith worketh patience this subject just came to me literally this afternoon when i was meditating i i was thinking about something that that happened to me uh the day before yesterday morning i was sitting and i was hearing from the computer [Music] only believe only belief lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe i i i'm told to myself i think that's a preaching that's going on i i wanted to know what sermon it was and it was towards the prayer he was basically uh participating in a prayer lord yeah the computer was on screensaver okay and so i didn't know what message what that was playing i thought maybe my wife often time before she goes to bed she will play a message and she'll just let it play all the time i looked at the the messages that she was been playing the day the night before and i brought it towards the end i'm fast forwarded to to hear the the songs and when i got to the end it was a different song it was thinking it was sing uh singing take the name of jesus with you foreign so i just believe that god wanted to speak to me about only belief and uh last night around 1am in the morning my pharmacist is my wife was not feeling well and she said she wanted to go to the living room and listen to a sermon and when i was still in the bedroom i heard the same song play while she was listening and then i came out to see what what message it was and then i saw it was a message greater than solomon is here and as i was thinking about that this afternoon the lord had placed on my heart to speak a little bit about faith la foreign faith we know is the very foundation of christianity because the bible tells us that all that comes to the lord dwells so the main thing that god is asking us is to believe it that's what to have faith may perform who knows that person did you but sometimes we come to god awakening uniformental with some mental faith sometimes we suppose we have faith but what the temptation comes difficulty when when when difficulties arises no faison we fail we forget that we have confessed that we have faith in our country and as we read in the book of hebrews the faith as the bible says it is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things that are not seen it means we have a firm assurance even when the world around us doesn't see the thing we have a firm assurance that that thing exists as long as our five senses that something exists because we heard it tell tasha that this bastard something exists because we've touched it [Music] some something exists because we've smelled it or because we have tasted of it [Music] that that it only takes for god to promise something for us it exists for us that thing is real it's a set and it's that kind of faith that god wants us to have and sometimes when we believe that we can have a superficial faith we come that that you have come to the stage that it's god that you know he's he's faithful that nothing is impossible to him that if you only believe you set it to the moment all that he's asking you to do is only to believe quite unique only belief the the remaining things is not but the devil will not truly you will not let you just believe that he will try all things to put obstacle in your presence he will do everything to try to discourage you but for god to bring your faith higher it has to bring you to trials if you have never come to trials you're not uniform you only have a mental faith you suppose you have faith you is to believe we see in the bible the patriarch uh job the scripture says job was an honest person job went to church and he knew according to the of freedom that he had to offer a sacrifice for his own sin and for the sin of his children he had the habit of doing it he was doing it by faith but his faith was never trialled but one day the devil realized that job was going to church the devil [Music] the devil said well he loves you because you blessed them he he loves you because he's quiet everything is quiet he loves you because he's never gone through difficulties let's let me touch him just a little bit and we'll see if he really has faith in one day look job lost everything that he had sure he lost his children kelly proof what what a trial jury proof what what the strong trial it was difficult for job but by faith [Music] blessed be the name of the lord he remained firm but the devil didn't stop there he went back to god just said that and you look at the trial that job was able to withstand that this great temptation his faith was trial and he showed that he had faith he said i want to share something i wanna touch his health and god said you can touch his health but i put the limit around him don't touch his life when god allows for the temptation to come to us the bible tells us in the book of lamentation chapter three the highest that these things come through we have to know that everything that comes to us the jerky donor is god who gives permission and when he gives permission it means he wants to show something behind godzilla because god does nothing for nothing he was he was he was a hit dude he says you continue to go to that church message don't you realize that the god of that message doesn't love you tell me in this country have you ever heard about somebody who suffer like you did how can you how can this god who's whose definition is a good god a god who loves his children he can allow that you find yourself in such a state it says uh curse god and die is and when they tried when the faith of job was trialed when god showed that i saw that job had patience is he was under the impression that god was no longer hearing him it says oh if i can know and knock at his door job began to look for the door where he can find god [Music] he comes to us sometimes you have the impression that god is no longer hearing your prayers but be certain my brother year for myself be sure to my sister that god is never far he's only been getting to try your faith to give you patience so you can have more confidence in him and when job stood firm god came on in his time [Music] he was no longer caring about his own life he had the memphis they're twisting the worm eat the flesh even if this sickness takes me away i know i will see god it will not be the eyes of another but it will be my own eyes he didn't even know that god was going to return a hundredfold what god promised was real and god blessed job and he gave him more than what he had another patriarchy another another patriarch that god trialled abraham abraham the father of faith abraham abraham at 75 years old safam so sonsenko his wife 65. past menopause many years ago they stayed as a couple for years and years sarah couldn't conceive abroad abraham was not even longer thinking about having a child with with with sarah abraham abraham was an idolater empire he was a pagan like you and i we were me but he found grace before the lord in those all of those that came from mesopotamia abraham found grace jerusalem god said come out of your country come out of your house go to a place that i will show you abraham only only followed he only obeyed he believed that the one who spoke to him was faithful abraham went to a a foreign land for me but he knew that someone promised him a place abraham went abroad he had multiple experiences with god abraham knew god and then one day god visited visited abraham and then he told him you will have a child let him leave us alone with us that story abraham can go and have his son with a child with agar judi it was god himself god said to abraham but abraham believed abraham testified that he would have a child with his wife sarah and every day we'll ask sarah you say something no and he waited for the promise for 25 years god tried the faith of abraham for 25 years and abraham continue to believe that god will do something and then one day god himself he came and he makes himself known as el shaddai to the point that sarah who was an old woman the brother catholicism of more than 80 years old was going to be a light by a young king to the point that he wanted a young king wanted to marry here why because god made them young she brought so he could work on her body so she can be ready to have a child jacob god is able to do everything when he makes a promise he may not tell us how he's going to bring it apart but all he's the same god who likes to try the faith abraham he says abraham i want you to offer me your son don unique your only son kelly proof what a trial of what office get offer me your child your only child the one that you i waited for a hundred years in my family and my that my wife had had her at eight years old you want me to give it to you just give up what is going to be left of me someone else could have said will sarah be able to have another child he came one time but will he do it the second time but abraham knew because that's the one who fulfilled this promise two second demons all that he's asking i will do it what will happen after the sacrifice he took everything that was needed for the sacrifice the wood the food the fire they went together they came to somewhere he asked the servants to remain behind he didn't exactly he says my son and i isaac lose the lord we're gonna go worship and we will come back he didn't say i will come back even though he knew he was going to sacrifice the child what i said will go but we will come back abraham knew that he was still a trial above the left and as we're going together isaac began to send something he says father here's the word yes the fire where's the sacrifice abraham by revelation it says god himself will provide a sacrifice for himself it is just a proof that god will provide a sacrifice for himself abraham never hesitated in his trial that let's just go buddha to continue to go to the end of what god had asked him to do is he tied isaac and isaac all obediently obedient he knew that his father was a servant of god he was a prophet of god that all that he was doing it was the will of god he he let his hand be tied behind he placed isaac and as he was getting ready to accomplish what god asked him to do the voice of god came out abraham now i know i tried your faith i know that you love me you just said that you are confused i know that you have confidence in me and because of this that posterity your prosperity [Music] the bible said the seed of abraham will will possess the gates of the enemy is a temptation or trial coming before you tonight he says trump coming before you tonight according because of the faith of abraham god is telling you tonight that you may possess that gate like the most of them regardless of what the what the dimension of the door is and god is going to try your faith too god wants to be sure that this is my child regardless of what happened to him he will keep his head high he will keep the faith he will always be have confidence another testimony of the trying of the faith the three hebrew children we know the story they were in in a strange land a strange country that memphis they even uh uh i tried to to to uh uh uh mph yeah they trapped them they tried to trap them okay offers all us that you deliver prophet in making a statue of the prophet daniel daniel he allowed the mother and they asked him to worship him they said god told us that the worship comes to him himself only him we know that that's a servant of god surely god uses him but we're not going to worship his stature we're not going to worship him because according to the word that he himself brought to us we have to believe regardless of the fanta fanaticism that comes forth it comes that god may use a man of god in a powerful manner that the fanatics around him they begin to lift him up sometimes we even bring him where he becomes a god to receive the honor that only belongs to god but according to the word of god regardless of what a man of god can do it's god who's using him and the glory only comes back to god look at jesus the scripture says he didn't think it robbery to be equal with god but he humbled himself these three hebrew children isabella they had faith they knew they knew in whom they had believed the king called them he said i love you very much i don't want to lose you i'll do it just worship the statue [Music] they [Music] they didn't know how god was going to deliver them but they had faith be quiet they were believing that god was able to deliver them it says fear is the greatest uh uh curse that could exist on the believer it's the greatest curse and quality when this animal was making a noise he was going back and the animal was getting bigger he makes a noise he goes back the animal gets better and that animal get got bigger complement and he understood there's something that's not going right when the animal makes a noise he says he makes choice he makes blue whoa the animals go down he it says that's the devil but when he's just exist he's just looking i will feel to scare you and when you have fear he takes most steps so if you can believe that the devil can manipulate you he will do it very well message you has to fail but if you stand firm believing that god is faithful get your feet you are a son of god regardless of the trial [Music] god will defend you god will hold on you i'll offend you at the end of the trial the greater the testimony the trying of our faith will produce patience it will produce confidence in god there is a testimony that god does nothing for nothing [Music] but talks about the child who was born it says why was this child born blind to let this child testify in the middle in the midst of the sacr uh of the high priest and all of them when god allows something to come as believers we have to believe that he will manifest his glory satan from there this child who was born blind he met jesus jesus opened his eyes he let a little one he went to testify let's sacrifice the the priest to high priest they wanted him to deny his testimony he defended you it says bless god set up my temperature this man is a sinner ready he said sinner i don't know but i know that god doesn't listen to sinners he says what happened it did two seconds you said i said all that i know it's that i was blind they're meant to know and now i see ricky and it's him who open my eyes cannot what's the testimony of your child he says he's old enough to speak for himself that he let him speak for himself because they didn't live that testimony their their own faith was not tried performing sometimes we only speak of testimony of ours god wants that every single one of us has his own testimony but we cannot have a testimony if we are not tried no no we cannot have a testimony if we have not fought [Music] like this uh uh uh we the woman of serepta it was just a little flower left a little oil left a man appears in front of her he said i'm a servant of god don't wobble give me to drink and i don't need to lose she gave water did he prepare my anger too it says make me a monster of bread it says there was only a little bit of flour left and a little bit of oil i would just make a little cake my child and i will eat yeah and then we'll die and the man of god said favorable make me one first kelly proof what a trial that regardless season but if i make it for the the man of god please accept the second human if i believe what god is telling me that's what permanent faith is faith can get me out of this situation doubt will keep you into a situation but faith will get you out of that situation and because of that faith this woman went and made they went make for the servant god manifested his glory situation can take longer but it says noah built the ark and he preached for 120 years so it could take longer the trial can take longer don't problem picture your problem can take longer you may have the impression that god forgotten me but god he never forsakes each other it's just a personal period that the situation may get worse god he never forsakes his children if you keep the faith situ if you believe that the same god is faithful he will come to pass he will be blessed in every way he already done it when he went to the cross pay the price of all the things that was concerning the people that pursued he paid the price for sin he first the kingdom of god and its righteousness he didn't say then after that you will look for the rest he says the rest will be given unto you when god finds that you need something regardless of the how long the trial goes god will give it to you [Applause] he already done it but even if jesus was standing here tonight that you came before him again he says i want you to heal me tonight he will tell you you let this i already done it do suck at your face what you need then don't accept it it's to believe right it's to believe it the journey that god has already done it since your money first person if it doesn't come to pass tonight your manifesto you will manifest yourself tomorrow if you don't have it tomorrow you must have it in a week you don't have it in a week it says your faith is greater who have turned upon the enemy to wait for a year for a turn for not jesus to wait for ten years magella company god will bring it to pass a young man who fell off a chariot when he was about 18 years old his uh backbone was broken he was on the wheelchair for for 62 years there was 76 years no susan 66 years 66 years sitting on a wheelchair god knew it and when he was about 85 86 years old he comes in a meeting of buddha and god gives a vision to barbara's all the way to the end of his life 66 years but god knew it god could have healed him all the time don't you thought but god waited 66 years to bring him his healing the time time belonged to god but he wants to try our faith and to know if we are faithful he could try us as young young ones in school to get into the conversations that are not good at in school but god wants you to testify that you are a christian that you may testify that you are a christian that you may hold regardless of the trial god is going to try you you focus but he wants you to stand firm evocation he wants you to have faith god tries our faith and it's when our faith is tried that we have patience that we have the testimony that we have more assurance second time it becomes a little bit easier let's give mr vanquish because we know that that same god who had done the last time he's i believe in him and here not long ago a lady came into the prayer line she's a yeah she's having a fast line el marche she was walking across oklahoma i believe it was in tulsa oklahoma [Music] she was walking through the line on her crutches and i said sir sister cause your sister will you believe will you believe me as a servant of god we miss you he said yes sir i said left one i said go up and place and throw your crutches down and go go on down walking [Music] i've been on these scratches for the two years for two years jedi i said to god you will probably always be on them and she went on yeah and it was over why she didn't believe ella used to improve she had a trial but she didn't believe 20 minutes about 20 minutes later you know a lady come through with two ushers with two ashes to help her hey let's and i felt the spirit drawing her to drawing to her el regard she looked up and she was crying i said mother do you that whatever you've asked god god will do it i said walk up there as i told the lady a while ago same circumstance it on me that if your servant has asked me to do it the toothless song in all things season if i don't throw it you gotta remember the key i will keep my crutches these are if i throw my creases sometimes we come to circumstances like that where god is trying our faith with his word and sometimes we give up with major province but god has to test us hello musicians as the musician will come let's prove the trying of our faith we cannot be a christian without god trying our faith regardless of what the doctor is saying no doubt the doctors there told things to the congressman absolutely until the end of your life that he will never be able to walk but god is able it's god who has the last word buffalo prophet sometimes the trial is difficult like a surah phoenix and woman allah and she was coming to god yay the disciples blocking her from getting to jesus but she was she kept on screaming himself he says it's not good to give the children's bread right to the dog he's treating me like a dog we said yeah it says yes lord have a petition but the little dog they even eat the little crumbs that fall off of the list let just me let me get the crown you have a situation that's taking longer you have a problem that you cannot overcome you you come you have the impression that the walk is getting harder join mala's uh you have a sickness in sims like it's getting worse and worse the doctor has already given you a big diagnosis the a woman who came out on the prayer line with her she had a handkerchief on her face she regardless of your sickness regardless of what the doctor is saying god is faithful and he's able he who said jesus i am the one who forgives you of all your iniquity and who heal of you of all your diseases he didn't say of some sicknesses and he left others my pastor is in the room my my my father-in-law he was in at the embassy of congo in south africa and concealed before and there that he was it was if they they tested on him he had a liver cancer before um it was 9 89 90 in 1989 or

today and in good health one part of our past he's not asking us to fear we're the most simple man it's only he's asking us to come forth and to claim the promise and he will bring you to pass may the lord bless you [Applause] amen praise the lord let's just stand [Music] praise the lord my how many are encouraged jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen i want to sing that song if

don't know but brother branham wrote that verse though i have suffered in many a way a way many of us can't even understand many of us can't even become to imagine how much the prophet suffered and he cried for healing watching people be healed day after day after day night after night after night if anybody could have complained anybody could have become hopeless come on if anybody faith was being tried if anybody who's learning patience by the things they suffered the devil could have come and said look he healed so-and-so right there in front of him he healed someone so oh how many cases he could say but what about you i cried for healing both night and day but faith wasn't forgotten by the father above [Music] he gave me a sign on the wings of the dove though i have suffered [Music] i cry for healing [Music] [Music] he gave me [Music] oh [Music] brother gary to come and close our service and bring her happy birthday brother gary man what a wonderful service my praise god why don't you just praise god for the learning god commonly spoke to you i was ministered to you oh i've been going through some things i've been going through some troubles but now god spoke to me and said
