[14:26] amen
[14:27] amen i'm gonna invite her to mike far so
[14:29] i'm reading this morning
[14:48] good morning
[14:50] i'm going to uh
[14:52] read out of psalm 52 this morning
[14:57] you know what uh
[15:00] i always like to
[15:01] look at the
[15:03] you know the history of when it is that
[15:05] david
[15:07] seems to be writing a specific psalm or
[15:10] focusing on a specific thing on his
[15:11] heart
[15:12] you know the story behind
[15:14] you know psalm 52 if you remember the
[15:17] scripture this was kind of his response
[15:19] to david hearing the news when saul
[15:22] the servant of saul slaughtered
[15:25] all of those priests all of those
[15:27] ministers of the lord
[15:29] those innocent people that had given him
[15:31] refuge and
[15:32] given him food and given him shelter and
[15:34] given him guidance
[15:36] and it was it's really the sad tale of
[15:38] innocent people
[15:40] being slaughtered
[15:43] because of a king trying to preserve
[15:46] his position
[15:47] to extend his
[15:49] power and his influence and
[15:51] try to build for himself a place of
[15:54] safety
[15:55] and david as he's reacting to the news
[15:57] you know starts to put together this
[15:59] psalm and
[16:00] you know crying out to the lord and
[16:02] maybe a little bit in frustration over
[16:05] you know all of the
[16:06] work of the enemy or the wickedness
[16:08] around to try to preserve carnal things
[16:11] and he finally comes to a conclusion in
[16:13] verse six that sort of stuck out to me
[16:15] in spite of all this nonsense the deceit
[16:18] the wickedness the lying
[16:20] you know the violence to try to for men
[16:22] to try to get a hold of a carnal
[16:25] possession
[16:27] he comes to this conclusion in verse six
[16:30] let's see if it's verse six it's verse
[16:32] eight i'm sorry it says but i am like
[16:35] a green olive tree
[16:38] in the house of god
[16:40] you know what a contrast that is right
[16:44] you know you look at one
[16:45] example of
[16:47] people out
[16:49] running about
[16:50] spinning narratives
[16:52] trying to influence one another out of
[16:54] their positions and build for themselves
[16:57] you know tabernacles of
[16:59] power and riches and carnality and
[17:01] things like that
[17:03] and then here's this other example of a
[17:05] little green olive tree sitting in the
[17:07] house of the lord
[17:10] it just seems like those two things
[17:11] couldn't be on the same planet
[17:14] and i just remembered how it said in
[17:16] psalm 1 blessed is the man that walketh
[17:19] not in the counsel of the ungodly
[17:22] nor standeth in the way of sinners nor
[17:24] sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[17:27] but his delight is the law of the lord
[17:30] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[17:32] night
[17:33] and he shall be like a tree
[17:36] planted by the rivers of water
[17:39] that bringeth forth his fruit
[17:41] in his season
[17:43] his leaf also shall not wither
[17:45] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[17:48] you know the thing about a tree is it
[17:50] doesn't move
[17:52] it just rests it's planted firmly in
[17:54] place
[17:56] it has everything it needs to live you
[17:58] stick that thing next to a source of
[18:00] water
[18:01] and it will far outlast the lifetime of
[18:04] any man in fact olive trees are known to
[18:06] live for thousands of years
[18:09] you can go over the middle east and find
[18:10] some that were around as jesus was
[18:12] praying in the garden of gethsemane
[18:16] you know in the midst of all of the
[18:18] struggle for power and influence and the
[18:20] things that men will do to one another
[18:22] in order to try to build a position or
[18:24] out position each other for things
[18:27] and then there are those who are like a
[18:29] tree planted
[18:30] in the house of the lord
[18:32] it's also interesting that there's a
[18:33] specific kind of tree that david is
[18:35] referring to here
[18:37] it produces a very specific kind of
[18:39] fruit
[18:41] it's it's the source of oil
[18:44] it's uh full of oil and all you have to
[18:47] do is get it in touch you get it in
[18:48] contact with a little bit of fire
[18:51] and it gives light to everything that's
[18:52] all around
[18:55] you know it's really easy
[18:57] in this day-to-day life to get lost
[18:59] in all of the struggle if you will to
[19:03] survive and build and construct
[19:06] places of safety out of carnal things
[19:09] the things that men will do to one
[19:10] another in order to do that
[19:13] but you know there's a different
[19:15] there's a different option
[19:17] i don't know about you but i'd rather be
[19:18] that little green olive tree
[19:21] in the house of the lord planted by the
[19:24] rivers of water bringing forth his fruit
[19:26] in his season
[19:28] you know if you ever want to if you want
[19:30] to read what it's like to be that green
[19:32] olive tree
[19:34] you can read matthew 5 to 7 and that's
[19:36] the olive tree
[19:38] teaching on what being an olive tree
[19:41] looks like
[19:43] but i just hope that a little bit of
[19:44] encouragement to you that
[19:46] you know if you look in psalm 52 here as
[19:48] we read it this morning it's just a
[19:49] little psalm but for those who love evil
[19:51] more than good
[19:53] lying more than righteousness it says in
[19:54] verse 5 god shall likewise destroy thee
[19:57] forever
[19:58] he shall take thee away and pluck thee
[20:00] out of thy dwelling place
[20:02] and root thee out of the land of the
[20:03] living but for that green olive tree in
[20:05] verse 9 it says i will wait on thy name
[20:08] for it is good before thy saints
[20:11] so let's just read psalm 52 together
[20:13] and encourage you to
[20:16] that we are little green olive trees in
[20:18] the house of the lord and not to get
[20:20] lost in the shuffle of the things that
[20:22] are about us let's read that together
[20:24] why boast us thou thy self and mischief
[20:27] o mighty man
[20:28] the goodness of god endureth continually
[20:32] thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a
[20:34] sharp razor working deceitfully
[20:37] thou lovest evil more than good and
[20:40] lying rather than to speak righteousness
[20:42] selah
[20:43] thou lovest all devouring words o thou
[20:46] deceitful time god shall likewise
[20:49] destroy thee forever he shall take thee
[20:51] away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling
[20:54] place and root thee out of the land of
[20:56] the living sila
[20:58] the righteous also shall see and fear
[21:01] and shall laugh at him lo this is the
[21:03] man that made not god his strength but
[21:06] trusted in the abundance of his riches
[21:09] and strengthened himself in his
[21:10] wickedness
[21:12] but i am like a green olive tree in the
[21:14] house of god i trust in the mercy of god
[21:17] forever and ever i will praise thee
[21:20] forever because thou hast done it and i
[21:23] will wait on thy name for it is good
[21:25] before thy saints
[21:32] amen
[21:33] hey man god bless you may have your
[21:34] seats
[21:35] amen
[21:39] oh
[21:41] magnified alone with me

[42:41] and then it is us that don't serve him
[42:44] like of hold
[42:45] and i said this because of one reason
[42:49] when i was in the military i'll be gone
[42:51] nine months at a time and uh i craved to
[42:54] be with my family so bad uh
[42:56] and then uh when i left the military i
[42:59] said i told myself i said god i want to
[43:01] be with my family i just want to be with
[43:03] them every single day
[43:05] and then when i left uh the first job i
[43:08] ever had was a kind of like a contract
[43:10] job but it's consulting it's just
[43:12] traveling and i'm like i have to provide
[43:15] for the family god okay i'll just do it
[43:18] and then i kept on traveling monday

[56:55] and to speak to our hearts
[56:58] so we've come this morning father though
[57:01] we're an embattled people
[57:04] though there's lots of pressure
[57:08] on us and a lot of things we don't
[57:10] understand
[57:12] we rest this morning
[57:14] knowing that nothing can pluck us out of
[57:18] the palm
[57:19] of your hand
[57:23] and
[57:24] what a comfort that is

[58:03] we try to serve you and put you first
[58:07] in this great hour
[58:08] we ask you to bless you we thank you for
[58:10] our musicians this morning our deacons

[58:21] we thank you for answering our prayer
[58:23] requests this morning
[58:25] just ask you to be with us now in a time
[58:27] of fellowship
[58:29] in jesus name we pray
[58:31] amen
[58:33] amen let's turn in our bibles this
[58:36] morning and
[58:38] and
[58:43] i i told
[58:45] brother billy i said brother billy you
[58:47] know i
[58:48] i don't really know exactly
[58:52] which way to lead the people or which
[58:54] way to go so i think we'll just go
[58:56] around in circles this morning
[58:59] you know we'll just review and talk
[59:01] about some things and
[59:04] and maybe lift our spirits up
[59:07] a little bit because i can honestly say
[59:10] i have never been this way before
[59:13] amen there's a lot of new things
[59:16] every day but let's read this scripture
[59:18] found in malachi and
[59:22] and the last chapter of the book of
[59:24] malachi
[59:26] and
[59:33] and maybe you remember this verse it's
[59:36] in malachi 4 and 5
[59:39] and 6
[59:41] amen
[59:44] and it says behold i will send you
[59:47] elijah the prophet
[59:50] before the coming
[59:52] of the great
[59:53] and dreadful day of the lord
[59:58] and he shall turn the hearts
[1:00:01] of the fathers
[1:00:03] to the children
[1:00:05] and the hearts of the children to their
[1:00:09] fathers
[1:00:10] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:00:14] curse
[1:00:15] amen our gracious heavenly father we ask
[1:00:17] you to bless
[1:00:18] your word to us
[1:00:20] this morning in jesus precious name we
[1:00:23] pray amen amen god
[1:00:26] bless you this morning you may be seated
[1:00:34] you know i would
[1:00:39] probably be able to make the conclusion
[1:00:42] this morning
[1:00:44] that
[1:00:45] most of us are here
[1:00:48] because
[1:00:50] we have come to the revelation
[1:00:53] and understanding that god
[1:00:56] has
[1:00:57] sent in this last day
[1:01:00] a prophet
[1:01:03] now
[1:01:04] in our
[1:01:06] religious
[1:01:07] setting in the society that
[1:01:10] uh
[1:01:11] we live in today that's a
[1:01:14] tremendous
[1:01:16] statement to make
[1:01:18] that you believe that there has been a
[1:01:21] prophet
[1:01:23] because uh
[1:01:26] most people would
[1:01:28] uh conclude that
[1:01:31] um
[1:01:32] that
[1:01:33] you know that jesus has come
[1:01:36] and preached the gospel and died on the
[1:01:38] cross and that his blood
[1:01:40] has sanctified us
[1:01:43] and cleansed us
[1:01:44] from all unrighteousness and we wouldn't
[1:01:48] need
[1:01:49] a prophet
[1:01:52] what a prophet is is he's a messenger
[1:01:56] he's god always has used the prophets
[1:02:01] when he wanted to deliver a message
[1:02:05] to his church
[1:02:08] net a prophet never did away with the
[1:02:11] passover
[1:02:12] a prophet in the old testament never did
[1:02:14] away with the temple
[1:02:17] but he guided the people when the people
[1:02:21] were moving
[1:02:22] away from god
[1:02:24] and that's what the message is due it's
[1:02:27] something from god to us
[1:02:30] to to bring us back to
[1:02:35] what is the original word
[1:02:38] and we know in this uh scripture here
[1:02:41] that
[1:02:43] he says i will turn the hearts of the
[1:02:47] children
[1:02:48] back to the father
[1:02:50] in other words back to the faith of our
[1:02:53] fathers that's what was beginning to the
[1:02:57] church was beginning to lose
[1:02:59] was the faith
[1:03:01] that our original fathers
[1:03:05] possessed
[1:03:07] and and saying this this morning uh
[1:03:13] it's it's like uh
[1:03:17] i read this statement
[1:03:19] to you um
[1:03:22] last week and i i or last wednesday
[1:03:25] night maybe it was
[1:03:26] it says
[1:03:28] he says see that's it
[1:03:32] when we asunder part
[1:03:34] it gives us inward pain
[1:03:38] and he says this i've seen
[1:03:40] the time brother
[1:03:43] now let me not condemn us
[1:03:46] but let me just wake us up
[1:03:50] to something
[1:03:52] and i think that's what
[1:03:55] that god's trying to do
[1:03:57] to the church is wake him up
[1:04:00] to something
[1:04:02] and he said
[1:04:04] i i've seen the time in this church
[1:04:09] that when people had to wait until
[1:04:11] wednesday night to meet another one
[1:04:15] they would cry over it
[1:04:18] and that's right
[1:04:20] i've seen ministers come in here and
[1:04:22] would say
[1:04:23] how do you do it well then people
[1:04:26] just one heart see
[1:04:29] i
[1:04:30] they meet at the door them sisters meet
[1:04:33] one another
[1:04:34] back there and hug each other and say
[1:04:37] sister be sure to pray for me now honey
[1:04:42] i'll see you again wednesday night
[1:04:45] i'll pray won't you
[1:04:47] you pray for me i'll be praying for you
[1:04:50] and make like that and tears in their
[1:04:54] eyes
[1:04:55] see the brothers shake hands
[1:04:58] one another's hands and just could
[1:05:00] hardly get away from each other like
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] that's real christian fellowship see
[1:05:06] just waiting
[1:05:08] praying for each or yes sir that's the
[1:05:11] way it should be
[1:05:14] all right
[1:05:15] and you know i wanted to
[1:05:17] make this point that
[1:05:20] you know i'm not trying to put pressure
[1:05:22] on you to come back to church
[1:05:27] but to make you aware that there's
[1:05:29] something happening in the spiritual
[1:05:32] realm
[1:05:34] that i want you to really
[1:05:36] uh
[1:05:37] understand that where i'm coming from
[1:05:41] that there's a spiritual effect and a
[1:05:44] spiritual
[1:05:46] toll
[1:05:47] being taken
[1:05:50] and
[1:05:51] uh and i want you to do
[1:05:54] and you know to do what you know
[1:05:57] the spirit word is telling you to do
[1:06:01] and
[1:06:03] that's the
[1:06:04] most important
[1:06:07] aspect
[1:06:08] of it
[1:06:10] is that you understand and and so
[1:06:14] i i want to use this statement this
[1:06:17] morning to kind of back up to where i'm
[1:06:19] going this morning it's just going to be
[1:06:22] fellowship this morning
[1:06:25] and
[1:06:25] he says now
[1:06:27] a jehovah witness is loyal to what they
[1:06:30] believe how many knows the jehovah
[1:06:33] witnesses are loyal to what they believe
[1:06:35] how many have you ever had them knock on
[1:06:37] your door
[1:06:40] you know i i think that's great
[1:06:44] you know i mean i i don't know if you
[1:06:47] know what they believe but they believe
[1:06:49] that there's a coming kingdom
[1:06:52] that's why they call it jehovah
[1:06:53] witnesses and they call their churches
[1:06:56] kingdom halls
[1:06:57] they believe that there's coming a time
[1:07:00] that
[1:07:01] the world government
[1:07:03] and the world will be run
[1:07:05] by the church
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:08] and the people will obtain
[1:07:11] positions
[1:07:12] in that kingdom
[1:07:15] according to how
[1:07:17] hard that they worked
[1:07:20] for that kingdom
[1:07:22] and how many converts they have and
[1:07:25] and it's it's a kingdom realm
[1:07:27] that is based on certain things
[1:07:30] and and these people believe that when
[1:07:33] they get out and they pass out the
[1:07:35] watchtower
[1:07:37] and they pass out uh
[1:07:39] whatever other little books that they
[1:07:42] have they pass out
[1:07:44] they believe that they're working for
[1:07:46] the kingdom of god
[1:07:48] and that there is a reward for their
[1:07:52] works
[1:07:54] now i just told you
[1:07:57] what they believe contains a lot of
[1:07:59] truth
[1:08:00] amen they believe that
[1:08:03] and anybody that really believes
[1:08:05] something and is convinced
[1:08:08] is concerned
[1:08:12] you know and then you know how can we as
[1:08:14] christians claim to have the spirit of
[1:08:16] the lord
[1:08:19] and believe that there's judgment coming
[1:08:22] and that there's that there's a hell
[1:08:26] that people are going to go to
[1:08:29] and they're going to be separated from
[1:08:32] god
[1:08:33] and believe that the wages of sin is
[1:08:36] death
[1:08:37] so if you see somebody and you know the
[1:08:40] way they're living and you know what the
[1:08:42] reward for that life is
[1:08:46] and you have the spirit of christ in you
[1:08:50] and you're convinced that there's a way
[1:08:53] to live
[1:08:54] that's to life
[1:08:56] and there's a way to live to death
[1:08:59] then wouldn't you in your spirit
[1:09:02] want to at least reach out to that
[1:09:05] person
[1:09:06] if you had any kind of
[1:09:09] common decency
[1:09:11] or any spirit of care or love at all
[1:09:15] and say friend
[1:09:17] you you know it's even among some of you
[1:09:20] you teenagers when you start to see in
[1:09:23] high school i guess or junior high now i
[1:09:25] guess when you start to see your friend
[1:09:27] starting to smoke and and everything and
[1:09:30] you go to them and say don't go there
[1:09:33] i mean you'll get cancer you'll be
[1:09:36] easily sick
[1:09:37] you you know what i mean there's so many
[1:09:39] bad things just common love
[1:09:42] and common concern
[1:09:45] would
[1:09:46] reach out and and try to tell somebody
[1:09:49] hey you're
[1:09:51] you're on the wrong road
[1:09:53] this is what happened this is what
[1:09:55] happens
[1:09:57] and uh
[1:09:59] you know they used to have a program
[1:10:01] where they would
[1:10:03] take first-time offenders
[1:10:06] and they would bring them into hardened
[1:10:08] prisons
[1:10:10] and they'd let those inmates talk to
[1:10:13] them
[1:10:14] for a little while
[1:10:16] and say okay this is what goes on
[1:10:19] in here
[1:10:21] you know what i mean and they would have
[1:10:23] some pretty straight conversations with
[1:10:26] them which can't be repeated from the
[1:10:27] pulpit i'm sure
[1:10:29] but they would basically
[1:10:32] try to scare them
[1:10:34] and let them realize that the life that
[1:10:37] they're living
[1:10:39] and the path that they're on out there
[1:10:42] leads them
[1:10:44] in here
[1:10:46] this is where you end up when you drive
[1:10:48] down that road
[1:10:50] and you know and of course everybody
[1:10:53] thinks that can get away with it
[1:10:55] but remember you can't get away with
[1:10:57] anything
[1:10:59] with god
[1:11:00] he knows the beginning
[1:11:03] from the end he he is the one that knows
[1:11:06] all things
[1:11:08] and so we can't escape him
[1:11:11] but so but what he does has done is he's
[1:11:13] given us the gospel
[1:11:16] to let us know that this life of the
[1:11:19] world
[1:11:21] is a life that leads to destruction the
[1:11:24] wages of unbelief sin is death but the
[1:11:28] gift of god is eternal life in christ
[1:11:31] jesus
[1:11:32] so he said jehovah witnesses
[1:11:36] uh
[1:11:36] is loyal to what they believe
[1:11:39] the baptist is loyal to what they
[1:11:41] believe
[1:11:42] the presbyterian is loyal to what they
[1:11:46] believe
[1:11:47] and they're just as loyal to their
[1:11:50] pastor
[1:11:52] can't we be
[1:11:53] that
[1:11:54] loyal to the word
[1:12:01] what uh
[1:12:02] what a
[1:12:04] i don't want to say it's a rebuke but
[1:12:06] what a an opportunity for us
[1:12:10] to look into the mirror
[1:12:14] okay somebody's standing back
[1:12:17] okay and they're looking at this jehovah
[1:12:20] witness and and and who are good people
[1:12:27] catholics are some of the most precious
[1:12:30] people i know
[1:12:32] it's a lot easier to get a catholic to
[1:12:34] help you to do something
[1:12:36] than than another protestant
[1:12:41] and so
[1:12:43] and and he's sitting back and he sees
[1:12:45] all these people faithful and loyal
[1:12:48] getting up and driving the bus you know
[1:12:51] because they have a bus driver ministry
[1:12:53] that's the baptist church or a sunday
[1:12:55] school ministry
[1:12:57] even uh
[1:12:58] we were over here at the place we rented
[1:13:01] for the
[1:13:03] young people here a little while ago and
[1:13:06] the gentleman there keeps the
[1:13:08] groundskeeper and the janitor and
[1:13:11] my goodness he did that job like it was
[1:13:14] a divine
[1:13:15] given
[1:13:16] ministry he looked at it like it was a
[1:13:19] ministry i i'm in charge of the building
[1:13:22] and i fix things and i clean things and
[1:13:24] and he was serving god
[1:13:27] in that
[1:13:28] and then he said they sit back and he's
[1:13:31] sitting back and he's observing
[1:13:34] these different forms of loyalty
[1:13:37] and and the way that these people are
[1:13:40] loyal to their sewing guild and to their
[1:13:44] bodies and they look he looks back and
[1:13:47] he's looking at this and now he comes
[1:13:50] down
[1:13:51] and he comes down to the people
[1:13:56] that have been given
[1:14:01] the
[1:14:03] interpretation and the opening
[1:14:06] of the seven seals
[1:14:08] the mysteries of god has been opened to
[1:14:12] the truth of the word has been unfolded
[1:14:17] and he looks at them
[1:14:19] straggling in the church at 10 30
[1:14:23] and knocked on one door in between here
[1:14:25] in church
[1:14:27] hadn't invited nobody to church hasn't
[1:14:30] picked up
[1:14:33] anybody
[1:14:34] for church hasn't testified to anybody
[1:14:38] oh they're loyal
[1:14:41] you know
[1:14:42] it's like it's like we feel
[1:14:45] like we're like god was obligated to
[1:14:48] give us this truth
[1:14:52] and and so
[1:14:53] it struck me
[1:14:56] that this week they had a minister from
[1:15:00] from fort worth
[1:15:02] and uh
[1:15:03] he's standing up against
[1:15:06] the people
[1:15:08] you know closing church and he told them
[1:15:10] he says hey
[1:15:11] people in this time they need church
[1:15:16] he said my congregation has doubled
[1:15:20] since this uh
[1:15:22] pandemic
[1:15:24] and i thought well you know why is that
[1:15:26] he says you know because
[1:15:29] people are afraid to go to hell
[1:15:34] but the only difference with us is we
[1:15:35] don't think we can go to hell
[1:15:42] you know
[1:15:45] it
[1:15:46] it it's kind of like
[1:15:48] you get an attitude
[1:15:51] and uh uh and so you know and then we
[1:15:55] we forget to understand that if god lit
[1:15:59] our candle
[1:16:01] no
[1:16:01] man lighteth a candle and put it under a
[1:16:04] bushel basket but he puts it up on the
[1:16:07] hill and then jesus says he says he says
[1:16:11] lay for yourself a pattern of good works
[1:16:15] that your good works might glorify your
[1:16:18] father in heaven
[1:16:20] and so
[1:16:22] he said that can't they be loyal
[1:16:25] he says now if those pharisees and
[1:16:28] sadducees and leaders
[1:16:30] if this is out of taking sides with
[1:16:32] jesus paragraph 2 12
[1:16:35] you can if you want to put it up
[1:16:38] now if those
[1:16:39] pharisees and sadducees and leaders of
[1:16:42] that day
[1:16:44] would have got away from their creeds
[1:16:47] and their dogmas
[1:16:49] and listened
[1:16:51] to what the word said
[1:16:54] and what jesus was telling them
[1:16:58] just exactly what the messiah was
[1:17:01] supposed to do
[1:17:04] they would have
[1:17:06] held on to him
[1:17:11] okay if they would have got away from
[1:17:14] their creeds and got away from other
[1:17:16] influences and just listened to what
[1:17:19] that he was preaching to him
[1:17:22] what that he was telling them what he
[1:17:25] told them the messiah would do
[1:17:28] they
[1:17:29] would have held on
[1:17:32] to him
[1:17:34] they would have held on to him
[1:17:39] just think of that
[1:17:43] see but they thought so much of their
[1:17:46] leaders
[1:17:48] now what i'm pointing at and what i want
[1:17:51] to talk to you and what i'm trying to
[1:17:53] expect to you is the understanding of
[1:17:56] influence
[1:18:00] he said and and that strikes me
[1:18:04] they would have held on to him
[1:18:07] but they thought so much of their
[1:18:08] leaders
[1:18:10] they wasn't bad men
[1:18:13] they wouldn't steal
[1:18:15] lie
[1:18:17] cuss
[1:18:18] or anything like that
[1:18:21] they wouldn't do that
[1:18:23] they wouldn't commit adultery why
[1:18:25] certainly not
[1:18:27] why they they would
[1:18:29] witness
[1:18:30] the stoning of a one that had did such
[1:18:34] things
[1:18:35] and they wouldn't
[1:18:37] they wouldn't do that they were good men
[1:18:41] but the only thing is they wasn't
[1:18:44] spiritual
[1:18:46] men
[1:18:48] morally they were fine
[1:18:50] but that isn't what counts
[1:18:54] what did jesus tell them
[1:18:57] even them loyal people said
[1:19:00] if ye are of your fathers the devil
[1:19:04] see it's the word
[1:19:06] that
[1:19:07] counts
[1:19:09] okay so the
[1:19:10] the thing of it was is that they they
[1:19:13] just
[1:19:14] they just weren't spiritual
[1:19:18] men
[1:19:19] okay and so that's what we wanted to
[1:19:22] talk about this morning just a little
[1:19:24] bit
[1:19:25] is
[1:19:26] is is you know
[1:19:28] having
[1:19:30] having a uh
[1:19:33] a uh
[1:19:34] a spiritual mind
[1:19:38] can you understand so we realize there's
[1:19:41] all this carnal stuff
[1:19:43] happening out here
[1:19:46] you know things are going on rapidly
[1:19:50] okay and
[1:19:52] and
[1:19:53] in the midst of
[1:19:56] these happenings
[1:19:58] there is leadership
[1:20:02] that's what our country just went
[1:20:04] through
[1:20:05] it went through a great big fight
[1:20:09] over leadership
[1:20:11] and this last campaign was all based on
[1:20:16] this
[1:20:18] uh plague
[1:20:21] one group of leadership said he
[1:20:24] this these people aren't leading us
[1:20:28] the right way
[1:20:29] concerning this plague
[1:20:32] and the other group said we will lead
[1:20:35] you
[1:20:36] in a better way
[1:20:38] you know we
[1:20:39] we
[1:20:40] are going to use science
[1:20:42] and we're going to take this science
[1:20:45] and we're gonna overcome
[1:20:48] this uh uh plague and
[1:20:51] the other side saying no you don't have
[1:20:53] to be as afraid of it as uh you know and
[1:20:57] and so it it
[1:20:59] if this great big conflict
[1:21:03] that was transpiring was all about what
[1:21:07] leadership
[1:21:09] who was going to lead
[1:21:12] and who was going to
[1:21:14] uh
[1:21:15] give us leadership
[1:21:18] so the the question is opposed to us you
[1:21:22] understand that the question is is that
[1:21:25] something is rising up
[1:21:28] to take leadership
[1:21:31] now we know that this world wants to
[1:21:35] come to
[1:21:36] a one
[1:21:38] head leader
[1:21:40] government
[1:21:43] that's what they want
[1:21:46] they want somebody to sit on the throne
[1:21:50] right an antichrist
[1:21:53] a vicar of christ somebody that's going
[1:21:57] to rule
[1:21:58] and something is going to create a
[1:22:01] consensus
[1:22:03] that we should all come together
[1:22:07] whether it's a system or a figurehead
[1:22:10] or everything and they're setting the
[1:22:13] tone
[1:22:15] for those things right now
[1:22:18] things are starting to fall in place and
[1:22:21] beginning to work
[1:22:24] so that
[1:22:26] a
[1:22:27] a
[1:22:28] consensus form
[1:22:30] of
[1:22:31] leadership or influence of the world
[1:22:37] i i thought i've got a little text today
[1:22:40] i thought it was amusing that it sent to
[1:22:43] me and it said the
[1:22:45] the cdc now says
[1:22:48] that people without any symptoms
[1:22:53] can spread the virus
[1:22:57] and the
[1:22:58] person wrote after that now it's healthy
[1:23:01] people that we have to be afraid of
[1:23:09] so pretty soon
[1:23:11] it's all the people who
[1:23:13] don't have any symptoms who aren't sick
[1:23:16] they'll have to quarantine
[1:23:23] and i thought my goodness
[1:23:26] where where where's the
[1:23:28] where's the spiritual mind
[1:23:32] where's the people that can stand back
[1:23:35] at and see what has slowly crept in
[1:23:40] how many understand that sodom has
[1:23:43] slipped crep in on america
[1:23:47] now america is identical to sodom
[1:23:56] i believe brother jairus would testify
[1:23:59] to me the other day that
[1:24:01] that the the the governor of his state
[1:24:06] doc is a uh
[1:24:09] a
[1:24:10] out of the closet
[1:24:12] uh known uh
[1:24:15] a female governor just right out bold
[1:24:19] leading governing
[1:24:24] we
[1:24:25] i believe again we have another catholic
[1:24:27] president
[1:24:30] we have
[1:24:31] six of the
[1:24:34] nine or seven of the nine supreme court
[1:24:37] justices are catholic
[1:24:44] uh
[1:24:45] i i mean i i you it just
[1:24:49] i i guess there's no
[1:24:51] way we read those quotes
[1:24:54] the other day where he said you can't
[1:24:56] even go to school see a kid go to school
[1:24:59] now day without something stuck in their
[1:25:01] ear
[1:25:03] let's ask a question
[1:25:07] okay how many people here have earbuds
[1:25:12] on you can't raise your hand
[1:25:16] you have a you have earbuds
[1:25:18] you don't have nothing you put on your
[1:25:19] ear no microphone god bless you brother
[1:25:23] you have some
[1:25:24] did you raise your hand
[1:25:26] he raised his hand
[1:25:30] no i'm telling you
[1:25:33] things are happening
[1:25:36] but we want to be able to be spiritual
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:43] and so
[1:25:44] uh
[1:25:45] and then we we read that that the time
[1:25:48] would come that they wouldn't know
[1:25:50] whether they were
[1:25:52] male nor female
[1:25:55] not that the female was acting like a
[1:25:57] man
[1:25:58] and the man was acting like a female and
[1:26:01] or they don't know what they are no it
[1:26:04] would actually come a time
[1:26:07] that they wouldn't know
[1:26:15] because they have a whole new definition
[1:26:21] it takes three parts it takes your mind
[1:26:23] how you think do you think like a lady
[1:26:26] or do you think like a man i don't
[1:26:28] understand that
[1:26:32] how do you feel
[1:26:38] and then what your natural
[1:26:40] birth was
[1:26:42] and so all three of those have to fall
[1:26:45] into some sort of harmony
[1:26:48] before you know what you are
[1:26:55] and what's one of the things that we
[1:26:57] we've preached and preached and preached
[1:26:59] it for the last five years was
[1:27:02] recognizing what who we are
[1:27:09] why was that so important
[1:27:12] when here on the world side
[1:27:16] they were losing their identity
[1:27:18] completely
[1:27:20] they don't know what they are
[1:27:24] and so we saw that so we saw these
[1:27:27] things that little things are coming to
[1:27:29] pass
[1:27:30] and then we realized when we read this
[1:27:32] he says all these natural happenings
[1:27:37] now they forerun spiritual happenings
[1:27:43] each happening accompanies
[1:27:46] the other happening
[1:27:49] it only improves it
[1:27:52] so
[1:27:53] we we come if we're spiritually minded
[1:27:58] which is what that we have to be
[1:28:01] because carnal things the carnal mind is
[1:28:06] enmity against god
[1:28:09] but the spiritual mind is life
[1:28:13] it's life in liberty
[1:28:15] so we we know that and the carnal things
[1:28:19] of this world are discerned by a carnal
[1:28:23] mind but spiritual things can only be
[1:28:26] discerned by a spiritual mind
[1:28:30] and
[1:28:30] that's why
[1:28:32] that
[1:28:33] the battle that takes place within your
[1:28:36] mind is the battle between the spiritual
[1:28:40] mind and the carnal mind
[1:28:44] right the five senses are
[1:28:47] are are
[1:28:48] are pressing in and uh
[1:28:53] trying to uh
[1:28:56] trying to get you to look at things
[1:28:59] in in a
[1:29:00] in a carnal manner
[1:29:03] and uh
[1:29:04] and yet the things of the lord
[1:29:07] are spiritually
[1:29:09] discern so he's listening he says
[1:29:13] he says i'm
[1:29:15] i'm telling you the truth
[1:29:17] and someday you'll meet it
[1:29:21] he says you you might say oh i swear
[1:29:23] that i never trespass the vows of my
[1:29:26] husband
[1:29:27] your husband will judge you
[1:29:30] if you did
[1:29:32] but god will judge you
[1:29:35] by what kind
[1:29:36] of a spirit
[1:29:39] you got in you
[1:29:44] not judge you by your body
[1:29:48] but by your spirit the inner man
[1:29:53] that's page 12
[1:29:54] uh
[1:29:56] paragraph 52 of
[1:29:59] god of this evil age
[1:30:02] so now we're talking about having a
[1:30:04] spiritual mind
[1:30:06] the first thing you've got to recognize
[1:30:09] with a spiritual mind is what god is
[1:30:12] judging you by
[1:30:14] how he's looking at you
[1:30:17] remember god works from the inside out
[1:30:21] the world works from the outside in
[1:30:26] so the world they they
[1:30:29] let me just say this to him he says the
[1:30:32] outside man
[1:30:34] is a physical being
[1:30:37] which is controlled by six senses
[1:30:40] five senses rather
[1:30:42] the inside man is a spirit man which is
[1:30:46] controlled by five senses conscience and
[1:30:48] love and so forth the outside man see
[1:30:52] taste feel smell in here so
[1:30:55] the
[1:30:56] god works from the inside
[1:31:00] stay with me this morning from the
[1:31:02] inside out
[1:31:05] satan
[1:31:06] works or the other spirit works from the
[1:31:10] outside
[1:31:12] so what he does is he tries to attack
[1:31:15] to approach the senses
[1:31:18] see here touched and smell
[1:31:21] and then he tries to go to the inside
[1:31:23] loving emotions so he comes from the
[1:31:27] outside
[1:31:28] trying to change
[1:31:30] the spirit
[1:31:32] on the inside
[1:31:36] so what he tries to do
[1:31:39] he tries to get you to like certain
[1:31:40] things feel certain things see certain
[1:31:43] things
[1:31:44] and then have the inside spirit pursue
[1:31:49] those avenues
[1:31:52] and let those ten avenues
[1:31:56] be the avenues
[1:31:59] that lead you
[1:32:03] one of those emotions that
[1:32:06] that
[1:32:07] affect the inside man is fear
[1:32:12] so he tries to control us by using the
[1:32:16] outside
[1:32:17] to come in to take control
[1:32:20] of the inside
[1:32:22] that that's what that's what's happening
[1:32:25] okay so we realize that part of us
[1:32:28] that and then we have the inside part
[1:32:31] and he says go on he says now
[1:32:34] but the inside of that spirit
[1:32:38] is a soul
[1:32:42] and it's controlled by one thing
[1:32:46] your free will
[1:32:49] you can accept what the devil says
[1:32:53] or accept
[1:32:54] what god says
[1:32:57] and that'll determine
[1:33:00] what spirit is
[1:33:02] in there
[1:33:06] so that's that that is what determines
[1:33:10] what spirit is in there
[1:33:12] right by the
[1:33:14] choices that is being made
[1:33:17] and the influence
[1:33:20] so if we're going to be spiritual
[1:33:23] and we see a great natural happening
[1:33:26] taking place
[1:33:28] we see a great move of the government
[1:33:31] we see a great move in the world
[1:33:34] we see things happening like never
[1:33:37] happening they they completely
[1:33:40] uh uh change the way the
[1:33:43] the world dresses
[1:33:47] yeah everybody's
[1:33:48] puts on a mess now everybody stays so
[1:33:51] far away
[1:33:52] can i i'm not i'm not saying whether
[1:33:54] that's good or that's bad don't don't
[1:33:58] miss my point
[1:34:03] my point is
[1:34:04] what
[1:34:05] is the spirit
[1:34:08] behind it and where
[1:34:10] is it taking us
[1:34:16] because the choice
[1:34:18] is is there and
[1:34:21] so he said now this inside of that
[1:34:24] so and that'll determine what spirit's
[1:34:27] in there
[1:34:28] if it's the spirit of god
[1:34:30] it'll feed on the things of god
[1:34:34] it won't feed on the things of the world
[1:34:42] that
[1:34:43] in other words it will feed on the
[1:34:44] things of god and the things of the
[1:34:46] world so there has to be some a
[1:34:49] spiritual
[1:34:51] ability in you
[1:34:53] and i'm saying this to you that you this
[1:34:56] morning
[1:34:58] have got to understand that you have the
[1:35:00] responsibility to your own soul
[1:35:06] to discern
[1:35:09] and that's what the scripture says you
[1:35:11] said you're still children because you
[1:35:13] can't discern between good and evil
[1:35:19] between the carnal
[1:35:23] and you know when you're in a war
[1:35:27] you know when you when you first when
[1:35:29] you're at peace
[1:35:31] the army's made out of old you know
[1:35:33] people young men 22 23
[1:35:39] on up
[1:35:41] but you get in desperate times
[1:35:44] you go into some third world countries
[1:35:47] where they're in great battles and they
[1:35:49] had great revolutions they had soldiers
[1:35:51] 13 12 14 15 16 years old
[1:35:58] they were pressed into battle
[1:36:02] and we've got to be pressed into battle
[1:36:05] now
[1:36:06] in other words we know that we have an
[1:36:08] enemy that's like a roaring lion
[1:36:12] who is the
[1:36:14] who is the prince of the air
[1:36:18] right he's the ruler of this world
[1:36:22] and now he's empowering himself
[1:36:26] to take control of this world and take
[1:36:30] control of his subjects and take control
[1:36:34] of his people and he'll do it by any
[1:36:36] means if he can go to a laboratory and
[1:36:40] come up with an invisible germ
[1:36:47] that's got everybody scared to death
[1:36:54] and
[1:36:55] you don't know where it's coming from
[1:36:59] or who's got it you got it
[1:37:04] i mean i've been tested i don't know how
[1:37:05] many times and i don't have it
[1:37:08] that's what they say
[1:37:11] and then i get a news flash hey if you
[1:37:13] don't have any symptoms you're probably
[1:37:15] the spreader
[1:37:22] oh i'm sorry
[1:37:29] you know so you come down to you come
[1:37:31] down to a time
[1:37:34] you understand where you've got to go
[1:37:37] back
[1:37:38] and anchor in something so i go back and
[1:37:40] i read mark 16.
[1:37:44] and i got a commission
[1:37:46] go into all the world preach the gospel
[1:37:49] lay your hands unto sin
[1:37:53] and they shall recover
[1:37:56] they shall take up serpents
[1:37:58] or drink deadly things
[1:38:03] you know serpents is spirits
[1:38:07] and there's a lot of deadly things
[1:38:10] besides sinai
[1:38:14] you can drink spiritually
[1:38:20] so there's a lot of ramifications in a
[1:38:22] lot of realms for that
[1:38:27] but
[1:38:28] the way the gospel
[1:38:30] is preached
[1:38:32] is by
[1:38:34] testimony
[1:38:36] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:38:38] the word of god
[1:38:40] by
[1:38:41] life and testimony
[1:38:45] and by
[1:38:46] signs
[1:38:47] and wonders
[1:38:51] that's the way the gospels preach
[1:38:55] and so if he can shut down the gospel
[1:38:59] what he's shutting down is his opposing
[1:39:03] kingdom
[1:39:07] what he wants to shut
[1:39:10] down he doesn't know the only thing
[1:39:13] that's holding this whole thing together
[1:39:15] are these nuts
[1:39:19] it's the oddballs
[1:39:23] so
[1:39:24] we see that he says so
[1:39:26] he said they won't feed
[1:39:30] the spirit of god and they won't
[1:39:33] they'll feed on the things of god and it
[1:39:35] won't fade on the things of the world
[1:39:38] jesus said if you love the world and the
[1:39:40] things of the world it's because the
[1:39:42] love of god has not entered
[1:39:46] this
[1:39:48] inward
[1:39:49] part
[1:39:56] okay so that that's what we got to get
[1:39:58] to
[1:39:59] we've got to get to this inward part
[1:40:02] where the love of god has entered into
[1:40:05] this inward part
[1:40:07] now this inward part
[1:40:10] is going to be
[1:40:12] what governs you
[1:40:14] and leads you
[1:40:16] and that inner part will not feed on
[1:40:19] anything else but the word of god
[1:40:26] that's what it feeds on it feeds on the
[1:40:28] word of god
[1:40:29] he says god is that near and depart
[1:40:31] satan has deceived you
[1:40:39] now
[1:40:42] what if this whole thing
[1:40:46] is nothing but a
[1:40:48] deception of the devil
[1:40:53] we have people who have caught the c19
[1:40:58] flu
[1:41:00] and they've been sick
[1:41:03] they've ate
[1:41:05] they've had headaches they felt
[1:41:07] miserable
[1:41:08] the worst part about the whole thing is
[1:41:10] they lost their appetite
[1:41:16] and
[1:41:17] and it's rough
[1:41:20] for four or five days
[1:41:25] and then after four or five days you're
[1:41:27] weak and you're
[1:41:29] stressed out and
[1:41:31] you feel bad and then all of a sudden
[1:41:34] you start
[1:41:35] going sitting in the sun and
[1:41:38] you step outside and breathe some fresh
[1:41:40] air
[1:41:42] you start to come out of your prison
[1:41:45] and
[1:41:46] and you start to feel better
[1:41:49] and you start thanking the lord
[1:41:53] and everybody who's got better that's
[1:41:55] held the testimony god's my healer
[1:41:58] you understand that no nothing's going
[1:42:00] to take me home till i'm done until
[1:42:04] god's done with me and if it's my time
[1:42:07] i'm ready and i want to go home
[1:42:13] what i'm talking about is don't take the
[1:42:15] deception of satan's
[1:42:18] spirit
[1:42:20] of fear and and and and and uh
[1:42:25] all all these things that they want to
[1:42:28] attach to it politics and
[1:42:31] all this stuff
[1:42:35] you know we want to have a spiritual
[1:42:37] mind
[1:42:38] okay so this is what he says he says
[1:42:43] he says hasn't entered that airport
[1:42:45] satan has deceived you and man shall not
[1:42:47] live
[1:42:48] by bread alone
[1:42:51] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:42:54] the mouth of god
[1:42:59] and that's what we've got to that's what
[1:43:02] we spiritually now have got to
[1:43:04] understand the spiritual inner man
[1:43:09] which is determining what that were of
[1:43:13] has got to feed on something
[1:43:16] so it's got to feed on the word of god
[1:43:19] it's got to have an individual personal
[1:43:22] relationship with the word of god it
[1:43:25] can't be loyal to a human leadership
[1:43:42] let's go to 54.
[1:43:44] and the world seems to be in the most
[1:43:47] evil age that ever was
[1:43:52] never in any other age did women ever
[1:43:54] act like that
[1:43:57] never
[1:43:58] but just before the destruction of the
[1:44:01] andalusian world jesus referred to it
[1:44:05] we'll get to that after a while how many
[1:44:06] knows as it was in the days of noah
[1:44:12] has the holy ghost has god lost control
[1:44:20] that's just not a
[1:44:22] right
[1:44:23] in other words
[1:44:24] let's take
[1:44:26] a moment in our lives
[1:44:30] to put on our spiritual cap and say
[1:44:33] what's influencing me
[1:44:42] you know let's all the people
[1:44:46] you know okay so in our country we had
[1:44:49] two great people people
[1:44:52] and and they're great gospel preachers
[1:44:56] one great gospel preacher was fox
[1:45:04] well you go read your by your bible it's
[1:45:06] what he called herod
[1:45:13] and all hit that garbage
[1:45:17] you know well people like that garbage
[1:45:21] better than they did over here
[1:45:24] nsn
[1:45:25] bc whatever that stands for
[1:45:29] in all their garbage
[1:45:34] and believers
[1:45:39] glue in their ears
[1:45:44] oh and then go out and preach that
[1:45:47] gospel
[1:45:48] you've got another gospel to preach it's
[1:45:51] the gospel of jesus christ the same
[1:45:54] yesterday today and forever
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:03] let me tell you
[1:46:05] one side
[1:46:07] is a godless society
[1:46:12] right so the other side they throw a
[1:46:14] little god in
[1:46:16] and all the christians though that's
[1:46:18] their side
[1:46:21] but all he's preaching is lady osea
[1:46:24] more wealth more jobs
[1:46:28] more things
[1:46:29] he's preaching lady osea blind miserable
[1:46:33] poor wretched and naked and don't know
[1:46:36] it because you prosper and increase with
[1:46:39] goods and don't know
[1:46:46] that you're blind
[1:46:48] poor
[1:46:50] miserable
[1:46:51] and wretched
[1:46:57] there's another happening church
[1:47:02] come out from amongst them and be ye
[1:47:06] separate
[1:47:07] how can two walk together unless they
[1:47:10] agree
[1:47:12] that's right
[1:47:13] so a bunch go over here and they agree
[1:47:15] with this and they agree with that and
[1:47:17] another bunch runs over here and they
[1:47:19] agree and they agree with that and
[1:47:21] nobody
[1:47:26] goes back
[1:47:31] you know i thought this was what we were
[1:47:33] founded on
[1:47:37] but this is out of the picture
[1:47:40] it's out of the schools
[1:47:45] how come our country ever let that
[1:47:47] happen
[1:47:48] prayer is out of the school
[1:47:51] they want to take in god we trust off
[1:47:54] the money
[1:47:56] they won't preach anything that has
[1:47:58] anything to do
[1:48:01] they're taking
[1:48:04] nativity scenes
[1:48:06] out of public places
[1:48:08] they're removing the cross
[1:48:11] one stake
[1:48:13] the people made them remove the ten
[1:48:15] commandments
[1:48:18] is anybody getting a spiritual thinking
[1:48:20] a cap
[1:48:22] that satan is starting to take control
[1:48:30] no let me tell you this
[1:48:32] satan is starting to take
[1:48:36] control
[1:48:40] in fact i can say thus saith the lord
[1:48:42] because the prophet said they've got
[1:48:45] just what they deserve
[1:48:47] satan
[1:48:49] is
[1:48:49] their
[1:48:50] leader
[1:48:55] so just don't think
[1:48:59] that there's not spirits out there
[1:49:01] there's not things out there that are
[1:49:04] working
[1:49:05] to take care
[1:49:07] and to create a carnal situation
[1:49:11] that's going to put the believer in
[1:49:14] conflict
[1:49:18] amen
[1:49:21] we heard a message called the conflict
[1:49:23] between
[1:49:25] god
[1:49:26] and satan
[1:49:28] he says every time the spiritual
[1:49:32] and the carnal meet there is a clash and
[1:49:36] there is a conflict
[1:49:41] we are heading
[1:49:43] to a conflict
[1:49:45] and a clash
[1:49:49] with a system
[1:49:50] that is going to stand up against the
[1:49:54] word of god
[1:49:59] then what
[1:50:03] then what
[1:50:12] has god lost control
[1:50:14] or is he just permitting
[1:50:17] another agency
[1:50:19] to
[1:50:21] control
[1:50:30] okay do you is everybody spiritually
[1:50:33] understand that there's another agency
[1:50:36] out there that's now
[1:50:38] taking control
[1:50:47] i wonder
[1:50:50] the true answer to this question is
[1:50:53] in my opinion
[1:50:55] there is two opposing spirits
[1:50:59] in the world today
[1:51:01] at work
[1:51:05] now there can't be no more than two two
[1:51:09] heads
[1:51:10] one of them is the holy spirit at work
[1:51:16] the other one is the spirit of the devil
[1:51:20] and in this last days in
[1:51:23] deception
[1:51:27] the two spirits paragraph 56
[1:51:30] the two spirits
[1:51:32] one of them god's holy spirit
[1:51:35] the other one the devil's spirit working
[1:51:38] by deception
[1:51:40] and the people of the earth are now
[1:51:43] making their
[1:51:45] choice
[1:51:50] you can't avoid the choice
[1:51:53] you understand the conflict is coming to
[1:51:56] you the choice is coming to you
[1:51:59] and there's it's coming to the hour who
[1:52:02] will you serve
[1:52:05] choose this day whom you serve as for me
[1:52:08] and my house will serve god
[1:52:13] they did that to
[1:52:14] daniel daniel
[1:52:17] you can't worship
[1:52:19] you can't bow you can't pray to no other
[1:52:23] god
[1:52:28] did daniel say okay
[1:52:32] i'll just do what
[1:52:34] the king says for a few days here no
[1:52:37] biggie
[1:52:41] well what's it
[1:52:42] hurt
[1:52:44] you know god's pretty cool
[1:52:49] he'll take second place
[1:52:51] god i need a favor here
[1:52:54] would you just please forget who you are
[1:52:57] for a moment and just go take a back
[1:53:00] seat
[1:53:02] well i show this leader
[1:53:09] remember what i just read
[1:53:11] they like their leaders
[1:53:14] that's their leadership
[1:53:16] i'm just going to go with the leadership
[1:53:18] here for a few days and keep the peace
[1:53:21] now daniel
[1:53:26] daniel did as it was his custom
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:34] he went
[1:53:35] he opened the windows
[1:53:38] he looked towards jerusalem from whence
[1:53:40] cometh his help
[1:53:44] and he knelt down and he prayed for the
[1:53:47] day that he could go back to that land
[1:53:51] and enter into that temple
[1:53:53] and make sacrifice
[1:53:55] to his god
[1:54:00] you say what did it get daniel
[1:54:04] it got daniel a trip to the zoo
[1:54:11] and up in personal
[1:54:13] relationship
[1:54:15] with god's creation
[1:54:19] face to face with lions
[1:54:25] but he made a choice
[1:54:29] shadrach meshach and abednego they had a
[1:54:31] choice
[1:54:36] who you gonna
[1:54:37] you you've got to bow down when the
[1:54:39] trumpet sounds
[1:54:42] let me put it this way
[1:54:46] when the executive order comes forth
[1:54:51] when the county judge guidelines come
[1:54:54] down
[1:54:59] everybody obey
[1:55:06] o king
[1:55:08] live forever
[1:55:14] we thank you for the job you gave us yes
[1:55:18] we thank you for the honor you bestowed
[1:55:20] upon us yes
[1:55:22] remember these were the guys who
[1:55:24] wouldn't eat the king's food
[1:55:26] because it wasn't kosher
[1:55:31] so the cook just fed them bread
[1:55:34] and substance and they were healthier
[1:55:37] and fair and stronger eating the word of
[1:55:41] god then they were eating all the
[1:55:44] barbecued pork in the whole world
[1:55:51] and i imagine that king is pretty fancy
[1:55:54] with his barbecue
[1:55:57] they wouldn't eat it
[1:55:59] they wouldn't defile themselves
[1:56:05] oh you remember the scripture we read
[1:56:08] returning back to the faith
[1:56:11] what's supposed to be restored to us is
[1:56:14] the faith
[1:56:15] the faith of our fathers was determined
[1:56:18] as i just read that quote to you in the
[1:56:21] choices that they made
[1:56:26] do you remember
[1:56:27] me just reading that
[1:56:30] to you
[1:56:31] that
[1:56:32] and that will determine what spirit is
[1:56:35] in there
[1:56:36] you will accept what the devil says or
[1:56:39] what god says and that will determine
[1:56:41] what spirit's in there
[1:56:49] they wouldn't but file themselves
[1:56:52] because they had something in there
[1:56:55] they wouldn't bow down
[1:56:58] and they testified they say oh can't
[1:57:00] live forever
[1:57:04] but i can't obey
[1:57:06] that amen
[1:57:11] i don't know
[1:57:13] if my god will deliver me or my god
[1:57:16] won't deliver me
[1:57:18] it wasn't based on the deliverance
[1:57:21] it was based on the word of god
[1:57:26] what god said
[1:57:28] god said i am the lord thy god thou
[1:57:31] shalt have no other gods but me amen
[1:57:37] [Applause]
[1:57:39] that's what they were anchored on
[1:57:44] they weren't
[1:57:45] afraid of a respirator
[1:57:52] they weren't afraid of being sick for a
[1:57:54] few days
[1:57:56] they weren't afraid of death
[1:57:59] o king live forever
[1:58:01] whether our god will deliver us or our
[1:58:03] god won't deliver us this one thing i
[1:58:05] know we will not
[1:58:07] bow down to that idol
[1:58:13] the king was wrathed
[1:58:19] he said heat it up boys
[1:58:27] one times hotter
[1:58:30] that old barbecue that big old thing got
[1:58:32] started getting a little glow turn it up
[1:58:35] hotter pretty soon it was red
[1:58:39] you know you can get metal so red and so
[1:58:42] hot it's it becomes white looks like you
[1:58:44] can almost see through it
[1:58:47] and then guys went to open the door and
[1:58:49] they turned into crispy little critters
[1:58:51] and just
[1:58:53] fell over
[1:58:55] they got these big sticks and they
[1:58:58] pushed them in there
[1:59:02] you think they were afraid of the fire
[1:59:05] no
[1:59:06] they were afraid of what would happen to
[1:59:08] them if they bowed down to that idol
[1:59:12] that's what they were afraid of
[1:59:15] they are afraid what would happen to
[1:59:17] them if they became subject to that
[1:59:20] other spirit what would happen to them
[1:59:23] if they were deceived by those lies
[1:59:26] that's what they were concerned about
[1:59:28] don't worry about him that can deliver
[1:59:31] your body but worry about him that can
[1:59:33] deliver your soul into hell
[1:59:39] that's what they were worried about
[1:59:46] looked in there he says hey
[1:59:49] i thought i threw three in there
[1:59:52] who's this fourth fella
[1:59:56] now
[1:59:57] that king you knew had revelation
[2:00:00] if you read a story he's pretty
[2:00:02] spiritual guy
[2:00:04] he says this fourth one looks like the
[2:00:06] son of god
[2:00:13] you don't think he'll go with you
[2:00:14] through the fire
[2:00:16] he'll go through the flood
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:20] see it it's coming down
[2:00:23] so it's
[2:00:25] we're we're here we're at that time that
[2:00:29] that
[2:00:30] and the people are making a choice
[2:00:33] the holy spirit
[2:00:35] is here calling out a bride for christ
[2:00:38] yes
[2:00:39] he is going to vindicate his word of
[2:00:42] promise to her for this age
[2:00:45] showing that it is
[2:00:47] christ amen
[2:00:51] amen
[2:00:52] what a great thing so
[2:00:54] we we see these two great
[2:00:57] spirits
[2:01:00] are are at work now
[2:01:02] and there's a choice
[2:01:04] now
[2:01:06] as i i kind of moved to
[2:01:08] a close here
[2:01:10] this morning
[2:01:13] we read the scripture that says turn the
[2:01:16] hearts of our children
[2:01:20] back to the fathers
[2:01:22] and you know
[2:01:24] uh we were fellowshipping the other day
[2:01:27] and it
[2:01:28] kind of came on my heart
[2:01:30] in
[2:01:31] regards to listening to this message
[2:01:34] taking sides with jesus we listened to
[2:01:36] wednesday night
[2:01:38] that when we look back
[2:01:41] to what was restored
[2:01:44] we always go back to pentecost
[2:01:49] and we see these
[2:01:51] disciples coming out of the upper room
[2:01:55] speaking in tongues
[2:01:57] and
[2:01:59] doing signs and wonders
[2:02:03] so when we think of restoration of faith
[2:02:06] we always go back and think of the
[2:02:09] restoration
[2:02:10] of pentecost
[2:02:14] is that right
[2:02:16] that what's going to be restored to us
[2:02:19] is the laying on of hands and the
[2:02:24] speaking in tongues and
[2:02:26] and all these signs and these wonders
[2:02:31] which is true
[2:02:34] but
[2:02:35] i just want to spend a moment
[2:02:37] on this with you just for
[2:02:40] a moment this morning
[2:02:42] the faith that our fathers had that was
[2:02:46] to be restored to us
[2:02:48] was the faith they had before pentecost
[2:02:56] the word
[2:02:58] was made flesh
[2:03:01] is that right
[2:03:03] and
[2:03:05] that's what they believed
[2:03:09] they believed what they were hearing
[2:03:14] that's why they
[2:03:16] followed it
[2:03:19] that's why they took
[2:03:22] sides with it
[2:03:24] now there was a feast at canaan
[2:03:28] and jesus attended that feast and they
[2:03:30] ran out of
[2:03:33] wine
[2:03:35] and mary being a relative i presume uh
[2:03:39] or close friends with the bride and the
[2:03:45] bridegroom
[2:03:47] when they ran out of wine they knew that
[2:03:50] would be an embarrassment
[2:03:55] and so she said
[2:03:56] this is my son
[2:04:00] or this is jesus
[2:04:02] do whatever he tells you
[2:04:05] to do
[2:04:11] i want that kind of faith
[2:04:14] he says mother
[2:04:17] it's not my time
[2:04:21] of course her having a special
[2:04:22] relationship with the father
[2:04:25] fulfilling his word
[2:04:27] receiving the reproach
[2:04:30] on his behalf
[2:04:32] willing to bear a child
[2:04:34] conceived of the holy spirit
[2:04:39] she knew where she stood
[2:04:42] he says just do what he says
[2:04:45] he says go fill these
[2:04:47] basins up with water
[2:04:50] so these ordinary men
[2:04:53] isn't it funny that god always comes to
[2:04:55] the poor of this world rich in faith
[2:04:59] and we spend all our time trying to get
[2:05:01] rich
[2:05:02] and let our faith die
[2:05:05] where if we would
[2:05:06] increase our faith we would be rich
[2:05:12] and he fills these bottles full of
[2:05:15] water these things of water and they
[2:05:18] taste it it's water they know it's water
[2:05:24] and they bring it to us as we've done as
[2:05:25] he said
[2:05:27] if you said he says okay go draw from it
[2:05:31] and bring it to the
[2:05:32] the
[2:05:33] master of the feast
[2:05:36] and they go dip in and they bring it to
[2:05:38] him and he tastes it and he says
[2:05:41] how come you save the best
[2:05:44] till the last
[2:05:48] now i
[2:05:50] would imagine as far as wine goes
[2:05:53] that's the best wine they ever had in
[2:05:55] jerusalem they've never had a batch like
[2:05:57] that since
[2:06:02] you don't think those people knew
[2:06:07] you don't think that wine guy knew where
[2:06:10] that wine come from you don't think they
[2:06:12] knew what jesus did
[2:06:16] you don't think the people at the feast
[2:06:18] knew and their family knew
[2:06:22] you think that just was a secret
[2:06:28] that's why it's a shame
[2:06:30] when you keep your testimonies secret
[2:06:36] when god does something for you and you
[2:06:38] don't tell nobody you don't testify you
[2:06:41] don't share
[2:06:45] so they go they go start
[2:06:48] telling around this jesus in nazareth he
[2:06:50] may turn this water into wine he turned
[2:06:53] this water into wine i'm sure that was a
[2:06:55] buzz it was going on and all the little
[2:06:58] all the little talk shows
[2:07:01] that that were
[2:07:02] all going on in a little synagogue buzz
[2:07:05] when they went to their local synagogues
[2:07:07] hey how's the defeats the other day and
[2:07:09] this guy from nazareth
[2:07:11] his name was jesus he made seven vats of
[2:07:14] wine
[2:07:18] and the carnal mind goes oh what does he
[2:07:20] have a new recipe
[2:07:23] and the other guys are saying no it's a
[2:07:24] miracle
[2:07:26] and so his knowledge began to spread
[2:07:32] right
[2:07:33] and when when people heard the testimony
[2:07:36] those that had something in them
[2:07:39] something was awakened
[2:07:43] so when jesus showed up on the scene
[2:07:47] and he began to preach
[2:07:50] and he began to do his signs
[2:07:53] and his wonders
[2:07:55] the people were attracted to him and
[2:07:57] they audited him
[2:07:59] and they marveled at him
[2:08:01] and and they came and some came for the
[2:08:05] loaves and fishes and some came for the
[2:08:07] miracles but when it finally came down
[2:08:10] and jesus looked them he said well thou
[2:08:13] leave also
[2:08:14] he said where can we go
[2:08:17] thou alone has the words of eternal life
[2:08:24] that was before pentecost
[2:08:33] then he looked at him and says who do
[2:08:35] men
[2:08:37] say that i am
[2:08:40] he says thou art the christ
[2:08:43] the son
[2:08:44] of the living god
[2:08:47] they followed him enough they had
[2:08:50] watched him enough they knew this was no
[2:08:53] human
[2:08:56] attribute
[2:08:58] that's right
[2:09:01] this had to be god
[2:09:03] he said flesh and blood have not
[2:09:06] revealed this to you
[2:09:09] but my father which is in heaven has
[2:09:12] revealed this to you
[2:09:14] upon this rock i will build my church
[2:09:18] what spiritual
[2:09:21] revelation
[2:09:23] a spiritual mind that can spiritually
[2:09:27] discern between the carnal
[2:09:31] works of the devil
[2:09:33] and the word of god
[2:09:38] that was the faith
[2:09:42] that he wanted to return this to not to
[2:09:44] the works of pentecost that was the
[2:09:47] fruit
[2:09:49] that they had because they were endued
[2:09:51] with power to go into all the world and
[2:09:55] preach the gospel that's why that was
[2:09:58] given
[2:10:00] amen
[2:10:03] but the faith they had was before they
[2:10:06] endured
[2:10:08] with power
[2:10:10] that was the revelation of the word of
[2:10:12] god that they seen the word of god come
[2:10:15] to pass
[2:10:17] they seen the fulfillment
[2:10:21] they knew he was the word
[2:10:24] and that's what they took sides with
[2:10:30] and that
[2:10:32] the faith that they had
[2:10:35] so when you only look back
[2:10:38] to that
[2:10:41] and you're looking for the power
[2:10:44] you're not going back far enough
[2:10:47] to have the faith
[2:10:50] that he could give the power to
[2:10:55] because power without character is
[2:10:57] satanic
[2:11:00] so they believed they made their
[2:11:02] confession
[2:11:06] and he told them you go wait in the
[2:11:08] upper room
[2:11:11] until you're in dude with power on high
[2:11:13] because they had a commission
[2:11:15] he didn't tell him just go out and fill
[2:11:16] the commission he says go up there get
[2:11:18] this power i'm going to send you the
[2:11:20] spirit that's going to bring you into
[2:11:22] remembrance of all things that i taught
[2:11:26] it's going to lead you and guide you in
[2:11:27] all truth and righteousness because i
[2:11:29] will not leave you
[2:11:31] i will not forsake you but i'll be with
[2:11:33] you even
[2:11:34] in you till the end i will come unto you
[2:11:36] again and lead you and guide you in all
[2:11:39] truth and righteousness
[2:11:41] they were believers
[2:11:45] there was something in them that
[2:11:48] caused them to believe
[2:11:52] now we're
[2:11:54] now we've got a challenge
[2:11:56] before us
[2:11:59] is that right
[2:12:01] we've got it we're facing a challenge
[2:12:04] back as your pastor i'm sitting here how
[2:12:07] do i weigh this
[2:12:11] how many have ever heard the scripture
[2:12:13] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[2:12:17] together
[2:12:20] that's right
[2:12:22] would somebody go please search that out
[2:12:27] through the great ancient
[2:12:30] aramaic
[2:12:32] and find out if there was any government
[2:12:36] regulations attached to that
[2:12:41] i don't know
[2:12:45] i i i when i looked at and they said
[2:12:48] please shut your church down for two
[2:12:50] weeks i said okay i want to be a good
[2:12:52] neighbor
[2:12:53] i want to render to caesar
[2:12:56] the things that are caesar's
[2:12:59] all right we have 10 people here and the
[2:13:01] police show up
[2:13:06] i said okay
[2:13:08] i go with that
[2:13:10] and then it comes to this and then we
[2:13:12] take our pews out and then we spread our
[2:13:14] chairs out in everything
[2:13:19] do you think they're going to stop
[2:13:26] when
[2:13:28] do
[2:13:28] we take
[2:13:30] god's word
[2:13:34] amen
[2:13:37] my brother orlando told me he said
[2:13:38] brother mcgary when you read that quote
[2:13:41] that i want to show you something he
[2:13:42] said i just back there thought there and
[2:13:44] thought i said what were you thinking
[2:13:46] orlando he says i was thinking we're all
[2:13:48] going to jail
[2:14:00] okay i have a i have a brother
[2:14:03] i i'm gonna visit with him again soon
[2:14:06] one day his name's peter
[2:14:09] and he was dragged up in front of the
[2:14:11] sanhedrin
[2:14:13] and they whipped them and beat them and
[2:14:15] told them
[2:14:17] go
[2:14:18] no more
[2:14:20] and preach in this name of jesus
[2:14:29] by decree
[2:14:32] of
[2:14:33] roman
[2:14:34] julius abbot caesar
[2:14:42] somebody finally caught that out
[2:14:48] right
[2:14:49] what did they do
[2:14:51] they had a whole bunch of people having
[2:14:53] a prayer meeting
[2:14:58] and and
[2:14:59] they go to jail they come they go over
[2:15:01] there and then they're rejoicing
[2:15:04] and i believe the scripture said they
[2:15:05] grew in boldness
[2:15:08] preaching the gospel
[2:15:12] paul said i've been in jail i've been
[2:15:14] imprisoned i've been whipped i've been
[2:15:16] scourged i've been cast out i've been
[2:15:19] thrown asunder
[2:15:26] wait a minute we didn't want
[2:15:29] that faith
[2:15:33] of the fathers
[2:15:34] we wanted this one on the other side
[2:15:37] where we had all this intellectual
[2:15:39] understanding of the seals and we didn't
[2:15:42] have to make no choices
[2:15:50] right
[2:15:52] but the hour's coming
[2:15:54] i love
[2:15:58] i i don't love the devil
[2:16:00] but i had you have to admire his tactics
[2:16:08] right
[2:16:12] come together for communion
[2:16:14] when you come together assemble you know
[2:16:17] carry one for another pray for one or
[2:16:19] don't come if you're hungry now that
[2:16:21] every man needed home
[2:16:23] so we come together for the worse you
[2:16:26] know we don't come together for the
[2:16:27] better
[2:16:28] and everything but now
[2:16:30] you just you look at him
[2:16:33] until he gets out there he says oh
[2:16:36] here's people that believe in divine
[2:16:38] healing
[2:16:42] they they believe in laying hands on the
[2:16:44] sick and they'll recover
[2:16:47] they they believe in all things they
[2:16:49] come to church
[2:16:51] to pray for one another
[2:16:53] and to get well
[2:16:55] church used to be the place
[2:16:57] you came to when you were sick
[2:17:03] now it's the place you come to to get
[2:17:06] sick
[2:17:10] and now they say oh church people are
[2:17:13] assembling together because those people
[2:17:15] ain't got no symptoms
[2:17:18] so we'll just mark them the spreaders
[2:17:22] praise god
[2:17:23] we are the spreaders we're the spreaders
[2:17:26] of truth we're the spreaders of life
[2:17:29] we're the spreaders of gospel we're the
[2:17:31] spreaders of the spirit of god
[2:17:36] amen
[2:17:40] let's make them afraid to go to church
[2:17:42] let's tell them they'll get sick there
[2:17:46] let's tell them they can't get close
[2:17:48] enough to pray one for another
[2:17:50] let's put a muzzle
[2:18:02] uh
[2:18:04] [Music]
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:21] so what do they do
[2:18:22] uh
[2:18:24] hello
[2:18:29] remember
[2:18:31] if god doesn't watch the city
[2:18:33] the watchman watches in vain
[2:18:41] but they want to muzzle the ox
[2:18:44] they want to put all kinds of subtle
[2:18:46] things in that are teaching us
[2:18:49] creating us
[2:18:51] us developing a way of thinking in a
[2:18:54] society contrary to the word of god
[2:19:01] and there's going to be a conflict
[2:19:05] oh i really want to get into this
[2:19:19] well we won't i'll do it tonight
[2:19:23] there will be no streaming tonight
[2:19:31] [Applause]
[2:19:39] but it's the best part
[2:19:46] i'm going to preach on signs and wonders
[2:19:48] by attributes
[2:19:53] just how adam had the attributes of god
[2:19:56] in him because he was the son of god
[2:19:59] and why eve went out
[2:20:01] and why adam went out and what's really
[2:20:04] being restored
[2:20:06] in this day
[2:20:07] but
[2:20:08] let's just leave it this morning here
[2:20:13] and
[2:20:19] take an honest look
[2:20:24] if
[2:20:26] how many knows that we have a god of
[2:20:28] this evil age
[2:20:30] and we know that god this god of this
[2:20:32] evil age is created in eden right
[2:20:36] satan's eden of science education
[2:20:40] and we've read many times in this last
[2:20:43] few services this is
[2:20:45] a summary of what we've been preaching
[2:20:48] that this
[2:20:50] this bride
[2:20:52] has nothing to do
[2:20:54] with science education or knowledge
[2:20:58] science education and knowledge is the
[2:21:00] biggest hindrance
[2:21:02] that god's ever had
[2:21:04] is the thing that is against
[2:21:07] everything he says
[2:21:08] he says lay hands on the sick and they
[2:21:10] will recover there's no science for that
[2:21:14] there's only a god for that
[2:21:18] you shall take up deadly things and they
[2:21:20] shall not harm you there's no science
[2:21:23] for that there's a god for that
[2:21:29] is right
[2:21:30] he's the lord our god that healeth of
[2:21:34] all our diseases
[2:21:36] there's no science for that
[2:21:38] in fact it's contrary to common sense
[2:21:46] it's contrary for you to believe that
[2:21:49] god protects you
[2:21:54] like the man that was going to go to
[2:21:55] africa
[2:21:56] to minister the gospel he felt led to be
[2:21:59] preached to go there and they took him
[2:22:01] before the church board and they said
[2:22:03] you know there's malaria there
[2:22:08] malaria is very
[2:22:09] s
[2:22:10] sickening disease
[2:22:13] there's typhoid there
[2:22:15] there's
[2:22:18] leprosy there
[2:22:20] and they listed all these terrible
[2:22:23] things
[2:22:24] that could happen
[2:22:27] and the young man's answer
[2:22:30] was so pure it reminded me of the coin
[2:22:34] whose image is on the point
[2:22:36] they said sirs
[2:22:38] if god wants me in africa
[2:22:41] i'm safer in africa than i am here
[2:22:51] and if god wants you to serve him
[2:22:54] and to keep his word
[2:22:56] and to follow his commandments of
[2:22:58] baptism and foot washing and communion
[2:23:02] and he wants you to come to the house of
[2:23:05] the lord to worship
[2:23:07] you feel led how you're led of the
[2:23:09] spirit whatever spirit's in there
[2:23:12] you are safer
[2:23:14] in god's word
[2:23:16] than you are in that
[2:23:18] whatever program
[2:23:20] they have on the outside
[2:23:26] you say brother mcgarry you're going to
[2:23:27] get yourself thrown in jail praise god i
[2:23:30] know there's angels
[2:23:32] that can open cells
[2:23:38] and i won't be the first believer that's
[2:23:40] come up before a magistrate
[2:23:44] there's believers in this message that
[2:23:46] are in prison
[2:23:49] all over because they stood
[2:23:51] for the word of god
[2:23:53] it has nothing to do
[2:23:55] with coming to this building
[2:23:58] it has everything to do with what you're
[2:24:01] letting influencing you
[2:24:06] i have a cardinal brother a natural
[2:24:08] brother
[2:24:09] his whole hope
[2:24:11] and his whole trust is in the government
[2:24:17] he just turned 75
[2:24:19] yesterday i believe
[2:24:21] four years older than i am
[2:24:23] and my heart bleeds for him
[2:24:27] and he gets angry with me
[2:24:30] because i'm not as scared to death
[2:24:34] he says 250 000 people died from this
[2:24:41] and i thought
[2:24:42] my goodness michael
[2:24:44] 431 000 people died from alcohol
[2:24:56] i can save more people by shutting down
[2:24:58] every liquor store in this country
[2:25:02] than they can putting the whole country
[2:25:05] on lockdown
[2:25:13] i i forget it's it was a phenomenal
[2:25:16] number i i i this it may be 45 000 or
[2:25:20] 145 000 people died from second
[2:25:25] hand
[2:25:26] cigarette smoke
[2:25:31] secondhand
[2:25:34] because their argument is they have the
[2:25:36] choice to drink or not well they didn't
[2:25:38] have the choice to smoke or not
[2:25:42] it was second-hand smoke
[2:25:47] all these carnal logic
[2:25:50] but the truth of the matter if god be
[2:25:52] for you
[2:25:54] who can be against you
[2:25:56] was that right
[2:25:59] and if you're in the palm of his hand
[2:26:00] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[2:26:03] his hand
[2:26:04] so this is what i'm trying to say church
[2:26:07] don't get caught up in that fear
[2:26:12] i'm not saying don't put on a mask
[2:26:16] just like i say don't go to college i've
[2:26:18] encouraged every student in here
[2:26:21] that wants to go to college to go to
[2:26:23] college and be the best christian
[2:26:25] college student you can
[2:26:30] there there's a
[2:26:32] a a sister that's very dear to me a
[2:26:35] young sister i admire i
[2:26:38] uh she's been a blessing to me
[2:26:40] personally
[2:26:41] in her testimony she's she's achieved uh
[2:26:46] great things academically
[2:26:48] and and and i'll tell you all i mean i
[2:26:50] know this will probably make a lot of
[2:26:52] people man but i encouraged her to go on
[2:26:54] and get her phd to get her doctorate
[2:26:58] to be all that she can be
[2:27:01] i'm not afraid of that hurting her
[2:27:07] and you know i said her
[2:27:11] it's it's not about getting carnal
[2:27:14] it's about being spiritual amen
[2:27:17] discerning the things that are god and
[2:27:19] rendering to god the things that are god
[2:27:21] and when the things of caesar
[2:27:24] cross the things of god
[2:27:28] who gets the preeminence
[2:27:35] and that's what it's coming to
[2:27:38] and this is what i want to choose
[2:27:41] i want to choose god's word i want to
[2:27:44] have my faith in him to heal me
[2:27:47] i want to have faith in him to keep me
[2:27:50] i want to have my faith in him to lead
[2:27:52] me and guide me
[2:27:54] into all things i want to hear him hear
[2:27:58] ye him
[2:28:00] i i don't want to be so caught up by the
[2:28:03] paper so caught up by the news so caught
[2:28:06] up by what everybody's doing that i'm in
[2:28:08] fear for my job i like what brother
[2:28:11] branham said he said they shut every
[2:28:12] door to me
[2:28:13] i have no place to preach in any
[2:28:16] denomination
[2:28:17] i've been shut out of everything
[2:28:22] i've been cast out
[2:28:24] he said but
[2:28:26] when the young man gasped out jesus came
[2:28:29] and found him
[2:28:32] and brother brandon says you know
[2:28:34] he's got somewhere for me
[2:28:38] he's got some place for me
[2:28:41] and i don't know what this thing might
[2:28:43] do to you economically i don't know what
[2:28:46] it'll do to your jobs i don't know what
[2:28:48] it'll do to anything but let me tell you
[2:28:50] something if you get cast out he'll find
[2:28:52] you
[2:28:55] and he's got somewhere for you
[2:28:57] because nothing
[2:28:59] can pluck you out of the palm of his
[2:29:01] hands let's take sides with jesus
[2:29:05] let's take sides with the word of god
[2:29:07] let's have our faith in him that he'll
[2:29:09] take care of us i've never seen a
[2:29:11] righteous man
[2:29:13] make bread
[2:29:14] let's get back to a spiritual mind
[2:29:17] a mind that loves the lord a mind that
[2:29:20] serves god a mind that worships the lord
