[17:53] Lord, your grace is so powerful. It
[17:55] works the permissive right back into its

[18:29] of God. Use his lips to speak to us,

[28:21] grateful for
[28:22] the your goodness in our lives,
[28:26] Lord. How you're mindful, Lord, of all
[28:31] things. Lord, as I sat there and I saw
[28:34] so many hands raised and all the needs,
[28:38] Lord God, that are on the hearts of your
[28:40] people, Lord
[28:43] God, if they would have all been read,
[28:45] Lord, no doubt we'd still be listening
[28:48] to the long
[28:50] list. We're so thankful that you're
[28:53] inexhaustible, that your resources are
[28:56] unlimited, Lord.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:01] Lord, and that you paid one
[29:03] price, one time for all of it. Lord God,
[29:09] I just lift up all those unspoken needs
[29:11] unto you, Lord, and ask that you would
[29:13] move in everyone's life, Lord. That
[29:15] you'd bring to pass the thing that's on
[29:17] the people's heart, Lord God. Lord, that
[29:19] you draw us closer unto
[29:22] you, Lord. that you'd make
[29:25] a house call to grieve air. And the
[29:30] other ones, Lord, that are homesick.
[29:33] And Lord, I think of my father-in-law
[29:36] who's about to have a pacemaker put in.
[29:40] Lord, you're the creator of the heart,
[29:42] Lord God.
[29:48] Lord, we ask that your mercy would
[29:49] abound, Lord God, and that you'd be
[29:52] glorified in this
[29:54] situation, that all would be well, that
[29:57] peace would be
[30:00] restored, Lord, we just love you
[30:04] and ask Lord that you'd bless the tithes
[30:06] and the offering and Lord that your
[30:09] kingdom would advance in
[30:11] the perfect way that you desire it to.
[30:15] Lord God, may
[30:17] we we just lift it all up to you,
[30:20] committing it into your hands, Lord.
[30:22] There's no better hands that it could be
[30:24] in but
[30:25] yours. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[30:28] and ask all

[37:45] Amen. Amen. Man, who would like to be
[37:48] the first? Amen. Come on. Oh.
[38:05] be comfortable with that sometimes. I do
[38:08] want to give a a just a short testimony
[38:10] and keep it um just brief. But the
[38:14] Lord's so mindful of us. I we just went
[38:16] to camp and and uh on the way out the
[38:20] door were a little delayed because I was
[38:22] like, I should grab my fishing pole.
[38:23] It's a brand new fishing pole and and
[38:26] we're all in the car. We actually turned
[38:28] out I think almost under the block and I
[38:30] threw it in reverse and backed up and I
[38:31] ran inside and got a fishing pole and
[38:34] loaded up some lures and I and I put it
[38:36] in the car and the fishing pole that I
[38:39] took was one that um it was on sale at
[38:43] the Bass Pro Shop and normally like $200
[38:48] on sale for 150 and and uh it had the
[38:52] lose reel on it that I'd been wanting
[38:55] for a couple years just to own a a luge
[38:58] reel and it I kind of was looking
[39:02] forward to using that. And when I was at
[39:04] camp, it was I believe Friday night
[39:06] something settled in my heart. I was
[39:07] like, you know, you haven't really used
[39:08] it while you're out here. It didn't
[39:10] materialize. You brought it for a
[39:11] reason. Maybe you know you could give it
[39:14] to somebody. And I said, "Well, I don't
[39:16] even know." I remember just going, "I
[39:18] don't even know who I would give it to.
[39:20] I don't know why." The Lord just kind of
[39:21] spoke to my heart. You'll know. And
[39:25] uh I forgot about it really. And uh it
[39:29] was on the way out of camp and this
[39:31] young boy, he come up to me and he says,
[39:33] "What did you get me for my
[39:35] birthday?" And I said, "I know exactly
[39:37] what I got you for your birthday." So I
[39:40] pull out that fishing rod and reel and
[39:41] it had the tags on it and everything
[39:43] still. And I put line on it and you
[39:46] know, I gave it to him. He was, "You
[39:48] don't know how much I love fishing." And
[39:51] and I was just my heart was happy. I
[39:53] knew I'd done the right thing. It was
[39:55] just I felt good. And and um the other
[39:59] day we're just out by Bass Pro Shop and
[40:02] I was like, "Well, I'm going to run in
[40:03] there and go ahead and get that combo
[40:05] again." I I did I was looking forward to
[40:08] that. And uh there was only there was
[40:11] two 7 foot 3inch rods and there was
[40:14] like, man, I wonder if that last one's
[40:16] there, you know, because I thought about
[40:17] buying both of them. And I I be on my
[40:21] way in I reached in my back pocket and
[40:23] there was the cash that was the cost of
[40:25] the rod and reel and I don't know how it
[40:27] got there. And I it was just another way
[40:30] the Lord just telling me you did the
[40:32] right thing. Um me and my wife were like
[40:35] what she's like 150. I don't know when
[40:38] the last time I had we couldn't figure
[40:39] out how the money got there. She's like
[40:41] always check your pockets before I wash
[40:43] them. And I knew it was the Lord but I
[40:45] just wanted to give him the praise for
[40:48] that. And Amen. He does things to just
[40:50] let us know we're doing the right
[40:51] things. And I I wanted to just read a
[40:54] scripture because this was a prevailing
[40:56] uh theme for me through that camp. And
[40:59] when we're praying, believing, this is
[41:01] Matthew 10:8. It says, "Heal the sick,
[41:04] cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast
[41:07] out devils. Freely you have received,
[41:10] freely give." And um I know that I've
[41:13] been freely a recipient of his goodness,
[41:16] of his mercy, and of his grace. And in
[41:18] faith, I claim that promise that Lord,
[41:21] you've been good to me. You've told me
[41:24] to freely give. And I put that in
[41:26] motion. And uh I believe you just told
[41:30] me you can't outgive him. God bless you.
[41:39] Amen. That's certainly the the third
[41:42] best gift ever after salvation and wife
[41:45] fishing pole. You can't go wrong on
[41:47] that. Amen. God bless you, brother
[41:49] David.
[41:57] God bless you, saints. Um, I'll be
[41:59] really
[42:00] quick. Um, a little nervous. Excuse me.
[42:05] the week before the meetings, you know,
[42:09] I was going through a really tough time
[42:12] where the enemy was just fighting me.
[42:15] You know, kind of like you don't know
[42:16] what you're doing. You know, here you
[42:19] have someone's daughter, my
[42:22] wife, and you don't know where you're
[42:24] leading her. you know the meetings we
[42:26] had couples meeting which was really
[42:28] encouraging for me but it was just a
[42:31] battle that I was going in within myself
[42:34] and I started thinking you know kind of
[42:36] just thinking as if I've wasted some
[42:39] time you know I was up there in North
[42:42] Dakota there was a battle that I was
[42:45] fighting when I was there that I really
[42:47] wanted to come back I bought a car when
[42:49] I was there a newer
[42:52] car and they asked me to take an
[42:54] insurance on it. I didn't want to take
[42:56] any insurance. I was like, eh, it's new.
[42:58] What else could happen? What could go
[43:01] wrong? And one day, I was
[43:03] so in a state of depression, like just
[43:06] not knowing what to do. I started
[43:08] driving to run away from that place just
[43:11] to get away. And the car, the engine
[43:13] blew
[43:15] up.
[43:16] And that was kind of like really hard to
[43:20] navigate through for me. But then as I
[43:23] was there, you know, there was this
[43:25] voice that was telling me in my heart
[43:27] that you came in here for one purpose in
[43:30] this city for one purpose, for one soul,
[43:34] you know, and we were there with the
[43:36] brother, we will I will help with the
[43:38] church, you know, we'll help with the
[43:40] people. But then
[43:42] you but then you break into a space
[43:45] where you kind of just feel like you
[43:48] don't see that one thing that you are
[43:50] here for.
[43:52] It wasn't until I left, you know, when I
[43:54] was there, there was a young man that
[43:56] came in from the Congo and another one
[43:58] that's an
[43:59] Egyptian that we had ministered to and
[44:02] baptized. The Egyptian young man is
[44:05] actually in state here, you know, still
[44:07] talks to him about the gospel. He gave
[44:10] his life to Jesus, but he's not fully
[44:12] convinced that the message is, you know,
[44:15] this is how he has to follow. He just
[44:17] told me, "I ran to you here in Fargo
[44:20] because I wanted
[44:22] God." And after he got baptized, he
[44:24] disappeared. You know, it was quite
[44:26] weird for me. And then there was another
[44:29] young man, Daniel, that came in. You
[44:32] know, he was just very confused and
[44:34] things. And we started speaking to him
[44:37] about the gospel. He was baptized. My
[44:39] testimony as far as this last weekend
[44:42] goes. You know, I was up there maybe a
[44:46] month ago to clean out my apartment that
[44:49] I had up there and he approached me. He
[44:52] told me what he was going through and we
[44:55] prayed with him and everything. And then
[44:57] I invited him. We have a youth meeting
[44:59] coming up. Can you
[45:02] come? And you know it was like I don't
[45:06] feel it. This is what's going on in the
[45:08] family in life. I feel like giving up
[45:10] and this is the stage where I'm going at
[45:12] I spoke with him about this so I can
[45:14] share a little bit and as he was going
[45:16] through that time you know we prayed
[45:19] with him and then he came to the
[45:22] meeting after the meeting I didn't want
[45:24] to tell him tell me how everything was
[45:28] going but as I was speaking with him
[45:30] after the meeting he was just telling me
[45:33] something changed in my life David you
[45:36] know just that one change that once
[45:38] something just happened. I know it
[45:40] started happening, but really something
[45:44] new happened in my life. And as we was
[45:47] driving home, you know, that one voice
[45:49] that told me, "This is the reason why
[45:51] you came to Fargo, you know, if it was
[45:54] as if that voice was speaking to me
[45:56] again, you know, and this is that one
[45:59] person you went there for, you know."
[46:02] Um, I don't know. He just he made me
[46:05] feel so humble, you know, to know that
[46:07] God can put you through a certain
[46:09] situation where you feel like you don't
[46:11] know what you're doing for years and
[46:13] years and years just for one soul, you
[46:16] know, and um really glad that he was
[46:19] able to meet the Lord at the meeting. Um
[46:22] that's testimony really encouraged me.
[46:25] Another one is I was having pain in my
[46:27] back. Uh my shoulders was hurting
[46:31] because of some task that I was doing.
[46:33] that's kept on imbalancing my shoulder
[46:36] that this side was hurting. Believe I
[46:38] spoke with one of my brother here. I was
[46:40] like, "Brother, pray for me." But when
[46:42] we went through the meeting, we had
[46:44] prayed for it.
[46:46] And the Lord was, you know, I will say I
[46:50] had a surgery that night because as I
[46:52] was sleeping in the middle of the night,
[46:55] I woke up this whole side of my body was
[46:58] as if it was
[46:59] paralyzed and I started crying. My wife
[47:02] was praying for me was like we believe
[47:04] in God. She said some prayer and when I
[47:07] woke up in the morning, not only that
[47:09] because they had the blood wasn't really
[47:12] going at night. I thought it was weird
[47:14] after going through a prayer line then
[47:17] going home instead of things getting
[47:18] better. It got worse just at night. And
[47:22] she prayed for me in the night and in
[47:24] the morning I woke up. My whole body
[47:26] just felt strong and until now, you
[47:29] know, feels strong. Praise God.
[47:33] [Applause]
[47:38] Amen. Amen. I love to see when the Lord
[47:41] move and touches people. You know, we
[47:44] know a soul, one soul is worth a
[47:46] thousand world. Amen. 10,000 world.
[47:48] That's why, Amen. We want to see people
[47:51] on fire.
[47:59] I went to camp and I I really wanted a
[48:03] revival in my life and I wanted the joy
[48:05] of the Lord back in my heart and
[48:08] Thursday evening I knelt down was
[48:10] praying there at the altar. I really
[48:11] feel the Lord gave me the joy of the
[48:13] Lord back in my heart and a real revival
[48:15] in my life. So being prayer for me I
[48:17] don't just want to lose that. I want to
[48:19] keep that. really want to grow in the
[48:21] Lord and I just whenever you all pray
[48:22] remember me in prayer. God bless you
[48:24] all.
[48:31] [Applause]
[48:33] Amen. Who's
[48:45] next? God bless you.
[48:48] I'm going to give two testimonies.
[48:51] Uh so about in 2023 I worked with this
[48:56] organization that was federally funded.
[48:58] Uh we had to assist people who came out
[49:00] of Afghanistan and one of the guys that
[49:03] I was working
[49:04] with very smart guy. So one time he came
[49:08] to me before I even reached to the
[49:11] office he called me. He said hey Alons I
[49:13] really want to talk to you. Said okay.
[49:16] So he gets to the office and
[49:18] then tells me that something had
[49:21] happened between him and his wife and
[49:23] the police was
[49:25] involved.
[49:27] And considering that he was an
[49:29] immigrant, I understood that the
[49:31] situation was going to be very difficult
[49:33] for him. But while I was talking to him,
[49:36] I told him, I just want to ask you one
[49:39] question. And he said, okay, go ahead. I
[49:42] said, "The things that the police is
[49:45] accusing you of between you and your
[49:47] wife, did that really
[49:49] happen?" And he said, "No, it didn't
[49:51] happen." I said, "Okay, if it didn't
[49:53] happen, then I'll talk to God about it
[49:55] for
[49:56] you." So, since I was very busy at the
[49:59] office, I had this habit of uh waking up
[50:02] around 3:00 a.m. in the morning, kind of
[50:04] give God worship and reading my Bible.
[50:07] And this time I am praying and I just
[50:11] heard inside my heart
[50:14] um I didn't hear a voice that I could
[50:17] say I heard a voice but just inside my
[50:19] heart I had that conviction as if
[50:21] someone had spoken to me while I was
[50:24] praying for him of course. So the voice
[50:27] told me go tell him that his situation
[50:29] has been taken care of.
[50:32] So as I'm sitting in the office one
[50:34] random time again he calls me. Um I
[50:37] wasn't really serving him because the
[50:39] position I had was very different but I
[50:43] was just easy to talk to as some people
[50:45] said. So he called me again and he said
[50:48] hey if you if you are at the office I
[50:50] really want to come and talk to you. I
[50:52] said okay. So he would come and I would
[50:55] find just a pop in the room and we would
[50:57] sit inside and talk and he would tell me
[50:59] how much nervous he is. Anxiety,
[51:01] depression,
[51:04] um social services here have already
[51:07] moved his wife out of the house. She's
[51:09] pregnant. She's about to give birth.
[51:11] This is really so much for him. Uh he's
[51:14] working so many hours just to keep
[51:16] himself
[51:17] busy. So I told him, "Well, uh you do
[51:20] know that I'm not Muslim." and he said,
[51:21] "Yeah, I know you're not Muslim." And I
[51:24] told him, "Well, I was praying for you
[51:26] and God told me to tell you that your
[51:28] situation has been taken care of." Um,
[51:32] this is a Muslim person, right? So, he
[51:34] looks at me and says, "Thank you so
[51:36] much. I believe that what you're saying
[51:39] is going to happen." I said, "No, it's
[51:40] not about me. God just told me to tell
[51:42] you this situation is going to be taken
[51:44] care of."
[51:46] Um, few months went by and I really
[51:50] forgot about it. We would talk but
[51:52] talked about other things. So this one
[51:54] time he comes to the office and then he
[51:56] tells me how his job is going very well.
[52:00] Is actually making almost 10,000 a
[52:02] month. He's very happy. So um I'm I'm
[52:07] thinking in my heart I'm like okay so
[52:11] uh did you just call me for that? Is
[52:13] there anything else? But I didn't really
[52:15] ask him. So, at some point he just looks
[52:17] at me and says, "Oh, by the way, there's
[52:19] something I needed to tell you." I'm
[52:21] like, "What is it?" He said, "Well, um,
[52:24] the prosecutors told me the case has
[52:27] been there is no charge like they told
[52:29] him, so I'm good." I'm like, "Um, is
[52:34] that what they told you?" So, I'm fixing
[52:36] to ask him, "Do you remember I had told
[52:39] you this was going to happen?"
[52:41] So as I'm thinking about it and he looks
[52:45] at me and says, "I know what you're
[52:47] thinking about." I said, "What is it?"
[52:49] He said, "You're about to ask me if you
[52:52] did not tell me about this." So that was
[52:55] really a moment of joy, both of us in
[52:57] the office. People just saw us so crazy.
[52:59] But I was very happy for him because I
[53:01] knew it was uh he was a young family in
[53:04] this country and he was working so hard
[53:07] to kind of move on for from the
[53:09] situation that they were in. So I was
[53:11] really happy happy for him to see that
[53:13] someone who's a Muslim uh God gave him
[53:16] the opportunity to see what Jesus could
[53:18] do in his life. So I kind of ask him now
[53:22] from now on you have no reason to not
[53:24] believe that Jesus is God. This is now
[53:27] only you. Um so that is just someone we
[53:30] can keep praying for. Uh I'll move on to
[53:33] my second testimony. So in the same job
[53:37] uh about one year uh before today about
[53:42] one year um a group of people that I
[53:45] usually pray with reached out to me and
[53:47] said uh God says that you should save
[53:50] more because there's something coming on
[53:53] your way. I wasn't sure of what that was
[53:56] going to be. So I just kind of took a
[54:01] little bit precautions in ways that I
[54:02] was doing things. But until about
[54:05] October or September,
[54:08] um I saw myself and my part of my team,
[54:13] we were sitting in this hallway where we
[54:16] usually would have meetings and in that
[54:18] hallway um I saw us being let go.
[54:25] So I so telling me, oh no, thank you for
[54:28] everything you did for us and
[54:31] uh we have to let you guys go because I
[54:35] mean it it wasn't very clear for me
[54:37] until couple months ago. So I'm going to
[54:40] explain that. But that's what I saw and
[54:44] in my dream I also saw that I was being
[54:48] called back to come work and I said no I
[54:52] don't want to come back. So I didn't
[54:55] understand the dream itself until about
[54:57] February 11th of this year. Uh one
[55:01] random day at the office uh we just get
[55:04] an email saying oh guys come in the town
[55:06] hall there's something going on and then
[55:09] it was like okay you guys know that we
[55:10] are fedally funded uh the new
[55:13] administration is holding the money so
[55:15] we were not going to be able to keep
[55:17] everybody uh it's nothing wrong but it's
[55:21] just what we have to go through.
[55:24] So I saw my director, my managers, my
[55:28] CEO, they were all in the room giving
[55:30] all these speeches. Um, and they were
[55:33] trying to encourage us. So I started
[55:35] going around and just encouraging my
[55:37] team members. Um, the people who worked
[55:40] on my team, telling them, "Hey guys, uh,
[55:43] God will take care of this. Uh, don't
[55:45] worry about it. Everything is okay." So
[55:47] at some point I just see my director
[55:49] coming to me and she's
[55:52] like you you seem just fine or what's
[55:55] going on? I'm like well um God God gave
[56:00] me the opportunity to saw to see this
[56:02] coming and she got very interested. She
[56:05] asked me uh so what happened? I said
[56:08] well the way I saw it is that we had our
[56:12] block now I knew what we were talking
[56:15] about now. I was able to say, "I saw
[56:17] that we had a block in our findings, but
[56:20] at some point you guys were able to call
[56:23] us back, but I said no." And she looked
[56:26] at me and she was like, "Why did you not
[56:28] come?" I said, "Well, I don't know, but
[56:30] when you guys called me, I said no."
[56:33] So about three weeks, maybe four weeks
[56:36] ago, uh I think brother brother Gary I
[56:41] had a package that I asked to give the
[56:43] pastor to pray over for me uh on that
[56:46] package. So I wasn't planning to meet
[56:49] with the the
[56:50] pastor. Uh but I gave him the package. I
[56:53] was just expecting that no everything I
[56:55] had prepared in there where I was going
[56:57] to submit it. I just wanted him to pray
[56:59] over it. uh he was just going to pray
[57:01] over the package and then send it back
[57:03] to me or give it to brother Gary Gary
[57:05] and brother Gary was going to give it
[57:06] back to me. But the pastor insisted that
[57:08] he wanted to see me. Well, after church
[57:12] I went in his office. We talked a little
[57:15] bit. It's only after I talked with him
[57:19] then I knew why I was going to say no
[57:21] when they will call me. And while we
[57:23] were talking we talked about what was in
[57:26] the package. I explained him everything
[57:28] and he said, "Okay, we'll pray about
[57:29] it." Um, and he said to me, he asked me,
[57:32] "Why do you want to do such and such
[57:34] thing?" I said, "Well, what I'm doing is
[57:35] because I'm looking at other job
[57:37] opportunities that requires me to do
[57:39] such and such thing." And then we talked
[57:41] about what what I used to do. And he
[57:44] tells me, "Oh, no, you shouldn't be
[57:46] working with those people." Um, I said,
[57:48] "Okay." That's when I knew why when they
[57:52] would call me, I would say no. So that
[57:55] was Sunday evening and the next Monday
[57:59] as I was home I get a call from my
[58:03] manager. So I saw her call but I didn't
[58:06] want to talk. So I said okay I'm not
[58:08] going to pick up this phone. Uh she
[58:10] called a few times and finally I decided
[58:13] to call her back. So I called her back
[58:15] and I said hey Jean hi how are you? Like
[58:18] oh I just wanted to make sure that I
[58:21] reach out to you. I know you told us
[58:23] that when we will call you uh by the way
[58:27] this is now us calling you because I had
[58:29] told him about what I had seen and he
[58:31] said well we will be calling you but I
[58:34] just want you to know that you can come
[58:36] back uh we have all the funds you will
[58:39] keep your position and everything and
[58:41] then I said well um God had told me that
[58:45] you will call me and I think I shared
[58:46] this with you so I'm not going to come
[58:49] back uh so I'm right now, not doing
[58:53] anything. Thank God for giving me a
[58:56] heads up, telling me to save more, and I
[58:59] was able to do that. But I'm also
[59:01] grateful that he was able to keep me
[59:04] from being worried when many people were
[59:07] worried and struggling. Um, I'm thankful
[59:10] that he gave me the opportunity to be
[59:13] out of the storm. Thank you.
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:21] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[59:24] Amen. Can we get one more? Just
[59:28] remember, be mindful of time. We'll have
[59:31] brother Andrew come up. Somebody else.
[59:54] Okay, God bless everybody. I'll make it
[59:55] quick. Um, just wanted to take this
[59:58] opportunity to give God the glory for
[1:00:02] uh, full recovery um, even before it's
[1:00:06] fully manifested. But for those that
[1:00:08] don't know, on March 1st, I had an
[1:00:10] accident where I tore my ACL and some
[1:00:13] other stuff. Um, but I had surgery last
[1:00:16] Monday and they fixed it and so I'm
[1:00:19] recovering and just wanted to take this
[1:00:21] opportunity to testify and thank
[1:00:24] everybody that has poured out into my
[1:00:27] home helping out meals. I cannot um say
[1:00:32] how much that is so appreciated.
[1:00:35] um all the the check-in and all of that
[1:00:38] stuff has been magnificent. Um so just
[1:00:42] wanted to thank the church for their
[1:00:43] support and give God glory for full
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:01:01] restoration. Amen. Brother Adrian
[1:01:31] Thank
[1:01:35] you. God bless you, brothers and
[1:01:38] sisters.
[1:01:39] Um, I didn't know I was going to be
[1:01:41] doing this here today because I didn't
[1:01:44] even know we had had the opportunity to
[1:01:46] give
[1:01:47] testimonies.
[1:01:48] Um, I was standing there in the closet
[1:01:52] and the spirit
[1:01:53] just told me, "Why don't you testify
[1:01:56] about what happened?" This was about
[1:01:59] This happened two years ago, about two
[1:02:01] years ago on New Year's Eve. And um I I
[1:02:05] don't know why I came over, man. to my
[1:02:06] wife, why don't we ever testify about
[1:02:08] what God does in our
[1:02:10] life? And uh just standing there, I
[1:02:13] started remembering two years ago, it
[1:02:15] was on New Year's Eve and
[1:02:18] um we're praying over dinner and it was
[1:02:21] during that time that my wife is, as you
[1:02:24] all know, she's been having, you know,
[1:02:25] just physical battles with the enemy.
[1:02:28] And uh it was during that time it was
[1:02:30] real difficult. She was really sick and
[1:02:32] we were praying over the our
[1:02:34] meal and my daughter Aaliyah, she starts
[1:02:37] throwing up. So, she throws up once, you
[1:02:41] know, right after praying, she goes to
[1:02:42] the restroom, throws up and then uh
[1:02:45] we're like, "Wow, that's
[1:02:46] weird." 5 minutes later
[1:02:49] again. 5 minutes later again, she
[1:02:51] started she starts throwing up and
[1:02:53] throwing up and throwing up and I'm
[1:02:56] looking, okay, what do what do we do?
[1:02:57] which was my mother-in-law, my
[1:02:59] wife, and my baby, and my other baby.
[1:03:03] So, it was a real difficult time because
[1:03:06] you, a lot of you know that we've been
[1:03:07] going through these fights, and I'm
[1:03:09] thinking, "So, what do I do? It's New
[1:03:10] Year's Eve, you know? It's just
[1:03:13] something really difficult." And she
[1:03:15] keeps throwing up. We don't know what to
[1:03:16] do. So, I get in the car and I start
[1:03:19] going toarmacies trying to find find
[1:03:21] something to stop her from throwing up.
[1:03:23] And I just see my baby curled up in a
[1:03:25] blanket. you know, right next to me and
[1:03:28] I'm driving around. I go into the
[1:03:29] Walgreens and I don't want to leave her
[1:03:31] in the car. So, she gets off with me and
[1:03:33] I'm thinking my wife is sick at home
[1:03:35] like really bad and I don't know what to
[1:03:37] do. And
[1:03:39] um so I'm, you know, I'm I start driving
[1:03:42] to Cooks and we live in Cedar Hill. So I
[1:03:45] start driving to Cooks and I'm driving
[1:03:47] and then it starts raining and uh and
[1:03:50] then I'm thinking, what's going on? What
[1:03:55] is this? it. This voice just comes to me
[1:03:57] and says, "Is this it? Everybody's out
[1:04:00] celebrating. Your brothers and sisters
[1:04:02] are in church receiving the new year and
[1:04:04] you're driving to the hospital by
[1:04:05] yourself while your wife is
[1:04:07] sick." And at that moment,
[1:04:10] um, I just I could just remember,
[1:04:13] Brother Brandon, what he went
[1:04:15] through. And I just thought in my heart
[1:04:18] something just came to me and said, "He
[1:04:21] giveth and he will take it and he will
[1:04:24] be with us no matter
[1:04:25] what." And at that moment I was about to
[1:04:28] break down because I said this is it.
[1:04:29] This is not this can't be it. This can't
[1:04:31] be God. This can't be the way. This not
[1:04:34] and something in me just said, "No, this
[1:04:36] is it. And you're going to drive and
[1:04:38] you're going to go to the hospital." And
[1:04:40] we got to the hospital and
[1:04:43] uh you know I I took the my baby in and
[1:04:46] then they checked her in and they put
[1:04:48] her in a room and and and and
[1:04:49] and we were sitting there for hours and
[1:04:52] hours and all of a sudden she just
[1:04:53] stopped throwing up and they checked
[1:04:55] her. She's got nothing. Okay, she's got
[1:04:58] nothing. I'm still sitting there. I'm
[1:04:59] still worried about my wife and and uh
[1:05:03] at the end they they couldn't find
[1:05:04] anything. But, you know, it it was just
[1:05:07] something really hard that, you know,
[1:05:09] all this time, you know, you think about
[1:05:11] what God does in our lives and just I
[1:05:14] remember just driving to the hospital
[1:05:16] and looking at my daughter and just
[1:05:18] seeing her all curled up just the enemy
[1:05:20] just right on top of you. And then you,
[1:05:24] you know, we heard a message uh a
[1:05:26] sermon, brother Matthew, uh, anointed
[1:05:28] for the
[1:05:29] job. Are we joint anointed for the job?
[1:05:33] We certainly are. And we don't know it.
[1:05:36] We definitely don't know it. But we know
[1:05:38] that he has anointed us. He has given us
[1:05:41] what we need. We don't know when it's
[1:05:43] going to happen, how it's going to
[1:05:44] happen. But God in that moment, he said,
[1:05:47] "You're going to drive and you're going
[1:05:48] to keep going and I'm with you no matter
[1:05:50] what. He has never left us." And
[1:05:52] brothers and sisters, he's always going
[1:05:54] to be with us. In the worst of times, he
[1:05:57] has been with us when in I've seen it in
[1:06:00] in the worst of times. and the people
[1:06:01] that you love who are in there in pain
[1:06:03] and they're suffering and you see him in
[1:06:05] the bed, you know he's with us and he's
[1:06:07] always going to be with us. And brothers
[1:06:09] and sisters, I didn't know this was
[1:06:10] going to be a testimony night. He just
[1:06:13] came up and I was in the closet and he
[1:06:15] said, "Why don't you go testify about
[1:06:17] this?" And I wasn't even going to do it
[1:06:19] because I said, "No, this is about There
[1:06:21] you go. The enem is there. You know what
[1:06:24] for? This is about the camp. You have
[1:06:25] nothing to testify about. It's for
[1:06:27] someone." Amen. because the Lord put it
[1:06:29] in my heart to come and give you that
[1:06:30] testimony that even in the worst moment,
[1:06:33] there's a reason
[1:06:35] that we hear what brother what God has
[1:06:38] done in brother Brennham's life so that
[1:06:40] when we're in that moment, he reminds
[1:06:42] us, I've prepared you for
[1:06:44] this. Look at what I've done. And he did
[1:06:47] it for us and he's going to do it for
[1:06:49] forever until until we're up in glory.
[1:06:53] God bless you all.
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:07:00] Praise the Lord. Just want to apologize.
[1:07:03] It was supposed to be for campus. I
[1:07:05] guess I didn't specify that, but I
[1:07:07] certainly enjoy all the testimonies.
[1:07:09] We'll probably need a night where we'll
[1:07:11] have as many testify as possible. Let's
[1:07:14] all stand at this time. Amen. Amen. Is
[1:07:17] the God of miracles. He w if we can only
[1:07:20] recognize and see him walking around us
[1:07:22] every day, we'll see that he loves us
[1:07:25] and he guides us and he's with us every
[1:07:27] day. Amen. Key of F.
[1:07:31] Amen. Oh, reach
[1:07:34] out and touch the
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:38] Lord as he
[1:07:41] passes by.
[1:07:44] All you
[1:07:46] find is not to be
[1:07:49] easy to
[1:07:52] hear God's cry for his power.
[1:07:58] Sing by this
[1:08:01] moment
[1:08:02] your
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:11] [Music]

[1:08:41] [Music]
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:08:53] Reach
[1:08:55] out and touch the
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:03] Lord. Amen. Let's bow our heads together
[1:09:06] for a moment. Our precious Lord, here we
[1:09:08] are. Lord, by your grace, Lord, wanting
[1:09:11] to, oh God, do that which is pleasing to
[1:09:15] you. Lord, we've heard requests for
[1:09:18] prayer. We've heard testimony. Lord,
[1:09:20] you've heard the hearts of your
[1:09:22] children, Father, and our gathering
[1:09:24] together is for the preaching of the
[1:09:26] word. And so, as we commit this little
[1:09:29] time of fellowship once again to you, we
[1:09:31] pray that, oh God, your word would be
[1:09:34] the dynam dynamic force that causes the
[1:09:39] change in our heart. Lord, we need you
[1:09:42] to speak to us, Lord, in the season that
[1:09:45] we're in. And father, as we take a
[1:09:48] little time, Lord, it's not quantity,
[1:09:50] but it's quality. Lord, I pray you'd
[1:09:53] speak to every heart, every need. Lord,
[1:09:56] be magnified, be lifted high up above
[1:09:59] all the problems, all the confusion.
[1:10:02] Lord, will your Holy Spirit come and
[1:10:04] dissolve any doubt about the message
[1:10:07] that it's thus sayeth the Lord for every
[1:10:09] believer as we commit ourselves to you
[1:10:12] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Well, we
[1:10:15] won't keep you standing. I I just uh I
[1:10:18] thank the Lord because I mean, I'll
[1:10:20] testify myself and uh I'll say this. I
[1:10:24] was asked to kind of help facilitate the
[1:10:26] leadership of the camp. And you know,
[1:10:29] there's times where you just totally
[1:10:31] feel insufficient. And I thank God that
[1:10:35] he's he's there to lead us. And you know
[1:10:38] God's like in your situation and uh your
[1:10:41] circumstances in life you know if you
[1:10:44] just let the love of God lead you you
[1:10:46] know and let God even search your own
[1:10:48] heart and you know as he tries us and he
[1:10:51] does different things you find out that
[1:10:52] God's inside of there if you can get
[1:10:54] past yourself get past all your doubt
[1:10:56] and the way that you think the situation
[1:10:58] is and you just you just take another
[1:11:01] step right and so I thank God that you
[1:11:04] know the people that needed to come
[1:11:06] volunteered appeared. I know that there
[1:11:07] was situations where um things were like
[1:11:11] moving parts and so people that were
[1:11:13] going to be a part of the trip, not
[1:11:15] everybody could go and then we had some
[1:11:17] additions. So anytime there's a little
[1:11:18] bit of an adjustment to have, you know,
[1:11:20] and that's what it's like with the
[1:11:22] Christian life in life, we always want
[1:11:24] to make little adjustments, you know, we
[1:11:26] don't want to be so rigid that it's got
[1:11:28] to be this way, the way I planned it.
[1:11:30] And you know, that's what I think it's
[1:11:32] it's like uh Jesus even told the
[1:11:36] parable. He said, "You cannot put new
[1:11:38] wine in old wine skins." You know, the
[1:11:42] old wine skins were from the years
[1:11:44] before and the times before and they got
[1:11:47] a little crusty and they they couldn't
[1:11:49] hold the wine. And and so there's
[1:11:51] something about our experiences that God
[1:11:54] wants to pour himself into us. He wants
[1:11:56] to pour fresh man, fresh revelation. And
[1:11:58] so we don't want to be rigid. We don't
[1:12:00] want to be stiff and starchy. We want to
[1:12:02] be flexible that the spirit of God can
[1:12:04] move on us and give us new revelation
[1:12:06] and give us life. And there's a lot of
[1:12:08] times we're so filled up with what we
[1:12:10] had yesterday that God wants to pour on
[1:12:12] something new upon us, but we can't seem
[1:12:15] to make the adjustment. But I say, "Hey,
[1:12:17] let's be flexible to the spirit." I love
[1:12:20] how God is testifying from our brother
[1:12:22] and how God deals because that's how
[1:12:24] it's going to be for you. You're going
[1:12:26] to be in your life situation and
[1:12:28] circumstance and all the go God's going
[1:12:30] to put something on your heart to go
[1:12:31] pray for somebody. You know, all of a
[1:12:33] sudden it it it doesn't matter the
[1:12:36] outcome. It's just that you're faithful
[1:12:37] what God put on your heart. You want to
[1:12:39] keep that channel pure and clean and
[1:12:41] just move when he says move. Leave the
[1:12:44] outcome to him. Even if they don't want
[1:12:46] to glorify God, God is going to have
[1:12:49] somebody there that'll witness that
[1:12:51] Jesus Christ is present and alive today.
[1:12:55] Don't you love the Lord? I'll say it
[1:12:57] like this. The vans, all of the people
[1:13:01] that drove, the chaperrons, the
[1:13:02] counselors, God bless you. Thank you so
[1:13:05] much. I could see the hand of God
[1:13:07] orchestrating. I didn't have to put my
[1:13:10] stamp on it. I didn't have to do
[1:13:11] anything. I just watched God
[1:13:13] orchestrated. I saw God moving. And just
[1:13:15] even in the camp, thank you young people
[1:13:18] for shining the light. You know what?
[1:13:20] Your life makes a difference. You know,
[1:13:23] you're a reflection of what this message
[1:13:26] produces. You're the fruit of this
[1:13:28] message.
[1:13:29] So, keep striving forward. Keep going
[1:13:32] forward. Praise the Lord. Well, I I just
[1:13:35] tell you, I don't know how to I don't
[1:13:37] know how to go from this place, but you
[1:13:39] know
[1:13:40] what? Maybe if you'll just turn with me
[1:13:42] in uh Psalms 105.
[1:13:54] Yeah, just speak from my heart tonight
[1:13:57] and just trust the
[1:13:59] Lord. Psalms 105:1 says, "Give thanks
[1:14:02] unto the Lord and call upon his name.
[1:14:05] Make known his deeds among the people."
[1:14:07] I believe that's what happened tonight.
[1:14:09] You may have your seats. Amen. You know,
[1:14:12] there's something about sharing the
[1:14:16] goodness of God from your heart. Amen.
[1:14:19] You know, I tell you, there's a lot of
[1:14:21] people in this world, they want to share
[1:14:23] their gloom and doom and all of their
[1:14:26] mistakes and they want to share all
[1:14:28] their failures and their faults and
[1:14:30] their complexes and the past. But my God
[1:14:34] said in his word, "Give thanks unto the
[1:14:36] Lord and call upon him his name and make
[1:14:39] known the deeds among the people." I'll
[1:14:42] just say it like this. I I want to
[1:14:44] testify of something and it was just
[1:14:46] brought to my remembrance and I just
[1:14:49] tell you, I don't know who's going to
[1:14:50] need it here, but I tell you it it's
[1:14:53] something that we serve a God that is
[1:14:55] supernatural. Our God is on the scene to
[1:14:58] do miracles. He's here to do for you
[1:15:01] what you have need of. God has always
[1:15:03] done for me what I couldn't do for
[1:15:05] myself. Don't never let me get to a
[1:15:07] place where I think I can do something
[1:15:09] that for myself on the supernatural
[1:15:11] level. But God always does it by his
[1:15:14] word. He does it by faith in his word.
[1:15:16] And I remember there was a time when we
[1:15:18] were much younger and my wife and I, we
[1:15:21] had, you know, little ones running
[1:15:23] around. I tell you, there's one thing
[1:15:24] about a child. When you have a child and
[1:15:27] I believe Brother Adrian was testifying
[1:15:29] of his child, there's something about
[1:15:31] it. When when your baby can't breathe,
[1:15:33] your baby can't grasp a breath, there's
[1:15:36] something attacking your child. And as
[1:15:38] as a parent, God wants to train you as
[1:15:41] as to be able to entrust your children
[1:15:44] unto him. And if it's just a physical
[1:15:46] something, if it's just a natural
[1:15:49] something, well, well, we need to be
[1:15:51] able to trust their soul. And so
[1:15:53] sometimes God will take you and take the
[1:15:55] situation and and let it be. Oh, you
[1:15:58] could see the hand of God in the
[1:15:59] natural. I thank God for that because
[1:16:01] I'm that simple. I don't have complex
[1:16:03] ways of thinking. I do in some other
[1:16:05] ways, but when I could see it in the
[1:16:07] natural, it shows me the spiritual. And
[1:16:10] I was fellowshipping with brother Tommy
[1:16:11] over the weekend and I thought to just
[1:16:13] share this testimony because you might
[1:16:15] have need of it because if God's done
[1:16:17] something for somebody, he'll do it for
[1:16:19] the next person if they take the same
[1:16:21] approach. And so I'm here to tell you
[1:16:23] like I remember when my my boy he was
[1:16:25] going through a fit and he couldn't
[1:16:27] breathe. And then it just seemed like it
[1:16:29] the same repeat of what happened with my
[1:16:31] boy happened to my my Abigail. And so I
[1:16:35] remember it was late at night. This was
[1:16:37] a number of years ago maybe eight years
[1:16:39] ago or nine. And we were going through
[1:16:41] the same thing. Here I am. I've been
[1:16:43] here before. You ever feel like that?
[1:16:45] I've been here before. And but just has
[1:16:48] something has to come in memory just
[1:16:50] like it says in verse eight. He hath
[1:16:52] remembered his covenant forever, the
[1:16:55] word which he commanded to thousands
[1:16:57] generations, which the covenant that he
[1:16:59] made with Abraham, and his oath unto
[1:17:02] Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob
[1:17:05] for a law, and to Israel for an
[1:17:07] everlasting covenant, saying, Unto thee
[1:17:10] will I give the land of Canaa, and the
[1:17:12] lot of your inheritance. Amen. I just
[1:17:14] thought about that while I was in there.
[1:17:17] listening to the the testimonies. But
[1:17:19] but anyway, I was there at the emergency
[1:17:22] care. It's 2:00 in the morning and here
[1:17:25] I am. I'm feeling it. You know, the
[1:17:27] enemy would just he thinks he's got you
[1:17:29] whooped when you start getting
[1:17:30] terrorized.
[1:17:32] You know, and you get to seeing all the
[1:17:36] symptoms, my you get you get to thinking
[1:17:39] the worst. And here we are. we're going
[1:17:42] through it and we're at the the the
[1:17:44] clinic, my wife and I, and it's two,
[1:17:47] three in the morning. You're not even
[1:17:48] thinking straight. You're just, you
[1:17:50] know, all of a sudden, you know, you've
[1:17:52] tried everything you can. You've prayed,
[1:17:54] you committed her to the Lord, but it's
[1:17:55] time to move to the hospital. And we're
[1:17:57] there at the urgent care that was by the
[1:17:59] house. And I could just remember my
[1:18:01] daughter all bundled up, can't hardly
[1:18:04] breathe, just terrorized. And of course,
[1:18:06] the doctor's there. He ain't your
[1:18:09] friend. He ain't your friend. He's
[1:18:11] there. and he's just going he he's
[1:18:13] trying to deal with it the best that he
[1:18:14] can, too. But a lot of times, it's just
[1:18:17] part of the test. I mean, they know how
[1:18:20] to put the the fear kibos on you. It's
[1:18:22] like, whoa. And all of a sudden, I'm
[1:18:24] thinking, I'm an adult and and he's
[1:18:27] saying in front of my daughter and and
[1:18:30] you know, I just I was just thinking to
[1:18:32] myself,
[1:18:33] well, that's not right. And all of a
[1:18:36] sudden, you know, that anger that
[1:18:39] someone talked about recently, the fire
[1:18:41] of God, something started bellowing
[1:18:43] forward, you know, and I said, "Wait a
[1:18:46] minute." You know, and they they said,
[1:18:47] "We need to get her uh right away to
[1:18:50] Cook's children." And they they wanted
[1:18:52] to do all this stuff to her. And I'm
[1:18:54] like, "Okay, wait a minute here." They
[1:18:56] they even showed us on the DVD the
[1:18:59] X-ray, and they said it's pneumonia and
[1:19:01] all kinds of other stuff. And I'm just
[1:19:03] thinking to myself, I'm looking at my
[1:19:04] wife and I'm just like, "Wait a minute.
[1:19:07] We got a God. We're believers." Like,
[1:19:11] "Oh, uh, you know what? Okay. All right.
[1:19:14] You know what? You're saying we got to
[1:19:15] go." And and they wanted to take my
[1:19:18] daughter away from me to take her to the
[1:19:21] emergency room in an ambulance. And then
[1:19:23] they didn't want me to go. And I was
[1:19:25] like, "No." Okay. This is where I'm
[1:19:27] drawing a line here. And I just remember
[1:19:30] telling them, I said, "Whatever it
[1:19:32] takes, I will take her straight there,
[1:19:34] but I'm not going to leave her in her."
[1:19:36] Her blood pressure was like at 180, 190.
[1:19:39] I was like, they're like, "No, it's
[1:19:41] okay. It's not." I'm like, "No, it's
[1:19:42] not. I'm looking at my daughter and
[1:19:44] you're terrorizing her." And all of a
[1:19:47] sudden, I just said, "Okay, we'll take
[1:19:48] her." And they're like, "Well, you're
[1:19:49] going to have to sign a waiver of
[1:19:50] responsibility and all this kind of
[1:19:52] stuff." I said, "Whatever I got to do.
[1:19:54] I'm willing to go to jail for this. This
[1:19:55] is my daughter. She's mine and the devil
[1:19:59] ain't going to bluff me out of what's
[1:20:00] mine. Don't let the devil bluff you out
[1:20:02] of what is yours. You're a son and
[1:20:04] daughter of God. This is the season of
[1:20:07] resurrection. The life of Christ is
[1:20:09] coming back into the body of Christ. You
[1:20:12] are called to be a son and daughter.
[1:20:14] Rise up and shine to the glory of God.
[1:20:18] The devil's trying to get us off our
[1:20:20] ground, but we could stand on the word
[1:20:22] and believe for the promises. You want
[1:20:25] to see the righteousness of Christ
[1:20:27] living? You want to see the integrity,
[1:20:29] the honesty, it's here for you. It's
[1:20:32] here for me. Praise the Lord. And I just
[1:20:36] said,
[1:20:37] "Okay." They called ahead. We took the
[1:20:40] CD that they showed us the screen of her
[1:20:42] lungs with demonia and all that kind of
[1:20:44] stuff. We went over there and I was just
[1:20:46] like, "Okay." So, we got there. We
[1:20:48] waited an hour, two hours, whatever.
[1:20:50] They tried to get us in real quick. We
[1:20:52] tell them the story. By this time, you
[1:20:55] know, things, the nerves and everything
[1:20:57] kind of settled because we were just
[1:20:58] telling her the love of the Lord and how
[1:21:00] God is just dealing and you know how it
[1:21:02] creates an atmosphere. You know, your
[1:21:05] words create an atmosphere that others
[1:21:08] can come underneath that and rise up in
[1:21:11] the power of your testimony, the power
[1:21:13] of the words that you speak in the midst
[1:21:15] of your trial can create a world that
[1:21:19] others can live in. And so as we were
[1:21:21] there, I was just talking with my wife,
[1:21:24] just believing that God's going to work
[1:21:27] a miracle. And sure enough, when they
[1:21:29] came back, they they they told us that
[1:21:32] they looked at the DVD, the CD, whatever
[1:21:35] it was, and they said, "It's clear.
[1:21:38] There's nothing on it. You can go home."
[1:21:40] So within 30 minutes or an hour, we were
[1:21:42] released. You tell me that God isn't
[1:21:46] supernatural. You tell me that God's not
[1:21:49] mindful of his children. Sometimes we
[1:21:51] just don't want to go through the test,
[1:21:53] but you came here for the test. You came
[1:21:55] here to be tried and to, you know, it's
[1:21:58] not just to prove to Satan that you're a
[1:22:00] son or a daughter of God, restored back
[1:22:02] to full authority and privilege as a
[1:22:05] joint heir with Christ. The test is for
[1:22:08] you to recognize your sunship. It's
[1:22:11] nothing that you had to do or I did or
[1:22:13] didn't do. It was the call of God. It
[1:22:16] was God's fornowledge. It was his
[1:22:18] election. He was determined to raise you
[1:22:21] up to defeat your Goliath, your devil,
[1:22:25] your the the one that's making his boast
[1:22:27] on you. The one that keeps bluffing at
[1:22:30] you, saying there's no way you're going
[1:22:31] to make it, but I've already made it.
[1:22:35] God's already finished the work.
[1:22:39] God is undefeated. Yes, sir. And he's my
[1:22:42] God, and he's living in me. Thank God
[1:22:46] for that.
[1:22:48] We're the privileged people to know
[1:22:50] Christ in the power of his resurrection
[1:22:54] and the fellowship of his suffering. You
[1:22:57] mean there's God on the inside
[1:22:59] there? I didn't have to say it. He said
[1:23:03] it.
[1:23:04] By predestination, he planted a seed of
[1:23:07] himself. Oh, one of these days we're
[1:23:10] going to shake off all of this carnality
[1:23:14] and that which is on the inside will be
[1:23:17] in full plain view. You will be known as
[1:23:20] you are known. My we're coming to it.
[1:23:24] Praise God. Well, this is not what I was
[1:23:27] planning on sharing with you, but we're
[1:23:29] here. And I thank God because the moment
[1:23:32] you start talking about the goodness of
[1:23:34] God, he shows up. You can talk about him
[1:23:38] at work and you can tell about faith in
[1:23:40] Jesus Christ. You know, there's times
[1:23:43] where people, they look at you and they
[1:23:44] go, "There's something special about
[1:23:46] them, but I can't put my finger on it."
[1:23:48] And you can try to tell them it's about
[1:23:50] the word. It's about Jesus Christ
[1:23:52] resurrected. But you know what?
[1:23:54] Sometimes all people can do is just grab
[1:23:56] a hold of something and you want to work
[1:23:59] with their faith because God honors
[1:24:01] faith, right? Hey, if all you can
[1:24:04] believe is that doctor's heal and you're
[1:24:07] going to be well, praise God. I want you
[1:24:10] to be well,
[1:24:12] I want you to prosper and be in good
[1:24:14] health.
[1:24:16] You know, I I want the attitude that God
[1:24:18] has towards humanity. I don't want my
[1:24:21] fallen nature to try to blend into my
[1:24:25] message theology. I want the mind of
[1:24:27] Christ to be so on the front. How is
[1:24:30] that possible, brother Andrew? You're
[1:24:32] talking like you know something. It's
[1:24:34] not that I know something but I know
[1:24:35] him. And to know him as life. When you
[1:24:39] can know his feeling towards the sick.
[1:24:41] When you know his feelings towards the
[1:24:43] lost. Oh my. You just act. You're just
[1:24:46] walking cuz you know what he did for
[1:24:48] you. You know how merciful he was with
[1:24:51] your surgery. You know that he's done it
[1:24:53] for our sister uh uh Gabriella's father.
[1:24:57] She he had a had a heart transplant. God
[1:25:00] was merciful. We look at the
[1:25:02] testimonies. We can go on down the line
[1:25:05] down the line. How much more is going to
[1:25:07] God going to take care of our sister
[1:25:10] father?
[1:25:14] You know, God can snap his finger and it
[1:25:17] be gone. But praise God, we want we want
[1:25:20] more. We want them to see the love of
[1:25:22] God. How can they see it? We'll go
[1:25:25] through something for a while and you'll
[1:25:27] see how God's endearing is. He's
[1:25:28] longsuffering and he's patient. Oh, he
[1:25:31] takes pleasure in
[1:25:34] providing. He loves the fellowship of
[1:25:37] his suffering. Amen. And then it also
[1:25:40] it's an opportunity to shine the light
[1:25:42] and the love of Christ. Amen. Well, my
[1:25:46] we just might close here in just a
[1:25:48] little bit. I I don't want to hold you
[1:25:50] too long, but you know, is everybody
[1:25:54] feeling okay? You know, it's just uh you
[1:25:58] know, when you get to thinking about the
[1:26:00] goodness of God, it it makes you want to
[1:26:03] go rejoice and makes you want to testify
[1:26:06] and tell somebody that God's not dead.
[1:26:09] You know, he's not in a tomb. sir. Amen.
[1:26:14] You know, I think about when the story
[1:26:17] was said that Jesus Christ when he was
[1:26:20] resurrected, he appeared many days on
[1:26:24] earth and he even had fellowship and had
[1:26:27] meals. Oh my, do you realize one day
[1:26:32] before the change, the dead in Christ
[1:26:34] will rise first? You're going to end up,
[1:26:37] it's going to be a repeat. No doubt.
[1:26:40] You're going to see people and you might
[1:26:41] not know their name now, but on that day
[1:26:44] you'll say, "There's this brother and
[1:26:47] there's that brother and there's this
[1:26:49] person." All the dead in Christ shall
[1:26:51] rise first and then we'll meet him in
[1:26:54] the air. Amen. Are you looking for that
[1:26:56] day? I'm looking for that day.
[1:26:59] Amen. Well, I don't know how to turn a
[1:27:02] corner, but maybe we'll just try to
[1:27:05] close in the next 10 minutes if it's
[1:27:08] possible. So I I think God bless you,
[1:27:11] brothers. Amen. Yeah, we see some
[1:27:13] visitors. You know, we just we're so
[1:27:15] grateful that we're all a family of God.
[1:27:18] Doesn't really matter where you come
[1:27:19] from as far as country or uh different
[1:27:23] origins of life. But when you're the
[1:27:26] firstborn, you're family. Amen. But you
[1:27:28] know, I got to thinking about something
[1:27:30] and I was going to minister a thought.
[1:27:32] We'll just save it for next time. But
[1:27:34] maybe if I'll just kind
[1:27:36] of maybe give just a little bit of a
[1:27:39] preview of what you know, brother
[1:27:41] Brandham made a statement. And I was
[1:27:43] listening to this message that was
[1:27:44] preached
[1:27:46] um on this day in 1961 and it was called
[1:27:51] Abraham and his seed after
[1:27:53] him. You know, brother Bham gives a
[1:27:56] wonderful
[1:27:58] depiction. Well, hey, there it is. He
[1:28:01] said like that speaker over there and
[1:28:03] that speaker. He said that's like
[1:28:05] Abraham. I don't know if y'all can all
[1:28:07] see that speaker. That's what I was. So
[1:28:09] this is like Abraham and this is like
[1:28:11] his seed after him. So when God made the
[1:28:14] covenant with Abraham, he made it with
[1:28:16] his seed after him. So whatever God did
[1:28:19] through Abraham, he does it with the
[1:28:21] faith seed, the royal seed after him.
[1:28:24] So, if you go study his life, and we
[1:28:26] were going to go through some of that
[1:28:27] tonight, but just can't seem to break
[1:28:30] into that just yet. But I'll just say it
[1:28:32] like this. When you look at what God
[1:28:34] did, God in Genesis 12, he called him
[1:28:38] and he ended up saying to the Lord said
[1:28:41] unto him, "Get thee out of a country and
[1:28:45] thy from thy kindred and from thy
[1:28:47] father's house." And this is Genesis
[1:28:50] 12 1. But he says, "Unto a land that I
[1:28:54] will show thee, and I will make of thee
[1:28:57] a great nation, and I will bless thee,
[1:28:59] and make thy name great, and thou shalt
[1:29:02] be a blessing, and I will bless them
[1:29:05] that bless thee, and curse them that
[1:29:07] curse thee, and it
[1:29:09] shall and in thee shall all the families
[1:29:13] of the earth be blessed." Well, I got to
[1:29:15] rejoicing at that because if this was
[1:29:19] Abraham and this is his seed after him,
[1:29:23] right? And you're his faith seed if
[1:29:25] you're in Christ. If you're born again,
[1:29:27] you're Abraham's faith seed. Right? And
[1:29:30] so what God did for Abraham is he told
[1:29:34] him, he said,
[1:29:35] "Now get thee out of thy country and
[1:29:38] from thy kindred." You know, and many
[1:29:41] times when we go to camps or we have
[1:29:44] special meetings or something really
[1:29:47] supernatural happens with a person where
[1:29:50] faith can anchor, it dissolves the doubt
[1:29:53] whether you're a son or a daughter of
[1:29:54] God in that season, that moment. And
[1:29:57] then there's this cycle that I've
[1:29:58] noticed that happens where someone would
[1:30:01] say, "Well, I'm I'm in a state of
[1:30:04] justification." You know, justification
[1:30:06] is the reality that God chose you. You
[1:30:09] didn't choose God. God by his call, he
[1:30:12] called you before you were ever good
[1:30:15] enough, before you ever thought you
[1:30:18] could be religious or any of that. It's
[1:30:20] justification because he called you. And
[1:30:23] sanctification just be like if this
[1:30:24] vessel was uh emptied. Sanctification
[1:30:28] just comes and cleanse out the the
[1:30:31] vessel for service, right? And so people
[1:30:34] you you you realize there's stages of
[1:30:37] what brother Brand calls stages of grace
[1:30:39] that the believer goes through. And if
[1:30:41] you ever study and read the story of
[1:30:43] Abraham, you can see yourself in the
[1:30:46] story because if he dealt with a Abram
[1:30:48] and Abraham the same way as he's dealing
[1:30:51] with you, you can kind of look and see
[1:30:52] where you're at in the journey. And I
[1:30:55] think about, you know, the baptism of
[1:30:57] the Holy Ghost, right? And many people
[1:31:00] wonder, well, did I receive it? you
[1:31:02] know, is it for me? What what would it
[1:31:04] look like if it was in me? And so many
[1:31:07] times I think that people have the
[1:31:09] inside something already leading them,
[1:31:12] but they question it, right? And because
[1:31:14] they're expecting something other than
[1:31:16] what the message teaches. But I say if
[1:31:19] we go in and we're taught right by the
[1:31:21] word of God, we can recognize these
[1:31:23] things. We can recognize the enemy when
[1:31:25] he comes and tries to bring doubt and
[1:31:28] defeat us. But my thinking about you
[1:31:32] know brother Bam talking about the
[1:31:34] manifestation of the gifts and the and
[1:31:37] and then coming to a place you know we
[1:31:39] we believe in gifts. Amen. We believe in
[1:31:43] the gifts you know we believe in the
[1:31:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost to live a
[1:31:47] sanctified holy consecrated life. But
[1:31:50] you know whenever a person comes to the
[1:31:52] new birth you know it's like many times
[1:31:56] people when they read the scripture they
[1:31:58] they say you know as a as a son when
[1:32:01] you're born into a family you don't have
[1:32:04] rights to to be you're not a full heir
[1:32:08] of the promise yet because as Paul
[1:32:10] taught he says the the the son is no
[1:32:13] different than a servant until he comes
[1:32:15] to a certain maturity a certain conduct
[1:32:18] a certain well let's just talk about it
[1:32:20] a little bit. But there's got to be a
[1:32:22] separation from all unbelief, right?
[1:32:24] God, he wants to bring us to a condition
[1:32:27] of heart that we know that it's the
[1:32:28] inside soldier, the inside teacher. He's
[1:32:31] taking us to a place where we can
[1:32:33] recognize the word of God. We can
[1:32:35] recognize Satan's attacks on our lives
[1:32:37] and we can say, "Wait a minute. Now
[1:32:39] God's bringing me to a maturity." And
[1:32:41] that Holy Spirit, that tutor, because
[1:32:43] God wanted the best teacher, the tutor
[1:32:46] that can go report back and say, "You
[1:32:48] know what? your children, you know,
[1:32:51] they're doing exactly like I did when I
[1:32:55] was here, you know, and so that's that's
[1:32:57] what we want to recognize is that the
[1:32:59] the tutor, the indwelling of the spirit
[1:33:02] was to bring us to a place of adoption,
[1:33:05] you know. Thank God that we're in this
[1:33:07] place in this hour, in this season, that
[1:33:09] God's wanting to bring us to a place, a
[1:33:12] public place and perform the ceremony of
[1:33:15] adoption, you know, and I can't perform
[1:33:18] that for you. It takes God in you. It
[1:33:21] takes a season. It takes growing. We
[1:33:23] must grow in the grace and knowledge of
[1:33:26] our Lord Jesus Christ. And you know, we
[1:33:30] just want to go through whatever God
[1:33:32] wants to bring us through to bring us to
[1:33:35] that place. Amen. Well, I think we're
[1:33:37] getting close to a close now, and I'll
[1:33:39] just be real short,
[1:33:42] but you know, I got to thinking how good
[1:33:45] it
[1:33:46] is. Uh, yeah. I don't know if I'll get
[1:33:50] any, you know, and maybe I'll read this
[1:33:53] one quote out of this
[1:33:55] um message and I was just listening to
[1:33:58] it today, but it's in paragraph
[1:34:03] um
[1:34:04] 64 in this message called Abraham and
[1:34:08] the seed after him preached in um 1961.
[1:34:12] But he says, "Now Abram did not fully
[1:34:15] obey God until he fully obeyed God. He
[1:34:21] never did confirm the covenant to him."
[1:34:24] So, isn't that interesting that
[1:34:26] God, as you can read there, there's
[1:34:29] there's there's a desire, I believe, for
[1:34:32] our hearts to know to know without a
[1:34:35] shadow of doubt that God is in us. that
[1:34:39] God what he promised as far as being a
[1:34:42] joint heir with Christ. But sometimes
[1:34:45] the confusion I believe for us is well
[1:34:48] what's what's my part and what's God's
[1:34:51] part?
[1:34:53] Does it seem like that sometimes many
[1:34:55] times even in the preaching sometimes it
[1:34:57] seems almost in our minds contradictory
[1:34:59] like well what part am I supposed to do
[1:35:02] and what part has God already done? And
[1:35:05] so, you know, the the justification of
[1:35:08] God is God's choosing. And so, if we'll
[1:35:11] go into
[1:35:13] Romans and Romans 8, and I definitely am
[1:35:16] not going to try to read any of this
[1:35:17] because I feel like I'm just going to
[1:35:20] pull back on that. So, but in Romans
[1:35:24] 8, we'll read verse
[1:35:29] five. Romans 85.
[1:35:38] For they that are after the flesh do
[1:35:41] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[1:35:44] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:35:47] the
[1:35:48] spirit. But to be carnally minded is
[1:35:51] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[1:35:54] life and
[1:35:57] peace. Because the carnal mind is immity
[1:36:00] against God.
[1:36:03] For it is not subject to the law of God,
[1:36:06] neither indeed can
[1:36:08] be. So then they that are in the flesh
[1:36:12] cannot please God. But ye are not in the
[1:36:16] flesh, but in the spirit. If so be that
[1:36:21] the spirit of God dwelleth in you. If
[1:36:24] any man have not the spirit of Christ,
[1:36:26] he is none of his.
[1:36:29] But if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:36:31] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[1:36:33] life because of righteousness. But if
[1:36:36] the spirit of him that raisesth up Jesus
[1:36:38] from the dead dwelleth in you, he that
[1:36:41] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:36:44] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:36:47] spirit that dwelleth in you. Therefore,
[1:36:51] brethren, we are debtors.
[1:36:54] Well, I'm going to stop right there and
[1:36:56] just as something's coming to my
[1:36:59] mind, you know, it says we are debtors.
[1:37:02] Do you know you're a debtor?
[1:37:06] You know, this is the thing. If we're
[1:37:08] looking at what was God's part in the
[1:37:11] thing like you cannot pay the price what
[1:37:15] he did at Calvary, right? So let's if
[1:37:18] there's any confusion, your debt has
[1:37:20] been paid for your soul and also for
[1:37:24] what God promised. God
[1:37:26] promised that he would bring you to a
[1:37:29] place of perfection by his word, by the
[1:37:32] spirit of his word. And
[1:37:35] so but we are
[1:37:37] debtors. You know, when you think about
[1:37:41] Abraham and what God he made that
[1:37:44] covenant, he said, "Whoever will bless
[1:37:47] you will be blessed and whoever curses
[1:37:51] you will be cursed." Now, think about
[1:37:54] this. You are joined errors of that
[1:37:58] word.
[1:38:00] So if you and I know you believe it, but
[1:38:03] I'm going to talk to your mind for a
[1:38:04] minute because that word can pierce past
[1:38:07] your past, your past way of thinking
[1:38:10] because a lot of times you go to work
[1:38:11] and it's the same people or you go to
[1:38:13] school, it's the same people that you
[1:38:14] deal with and you got this big track
[1:38:16] record. You got this history and all of
[1:38:19] a sudden we go through this mental
[1:38:21] battle where it says, "Well, they didn't
[1:38:22] treat me right. They didn't do me
[1:38:23] right." And so we have this preloaded
[1:38:27] script. But I want to tell you tonight
[1:38:30] that whoever you you whoever blesses you
[1:38:34] will be blessed. You know, isn't it
[1:38:37] something that one of the things that
[1:38:40] you know we're taught by our prophet is
[1:38:42] this the best thing that you can sell
[1:38:45] say to somebody is what?
[1:38:48] God bless you. Like if you can say oh
[1:38:51] prosperity and honor and joy and all
[1:38:53] these things well that's okay. But if
[1:38:55] God blesses you,
[1:38:58] if by my word and God could come behind
[1:39:01] his covenant and God bless you, then
[1:39:04] you'll be blessed. Everything else, all
[1:39:07] that prosperity and joy, well, that's
[1:39:09] just part of the package if God will
[1:39:11] come and bless.
[1:39:13] My But think about it. If we're so
[1:39:15] positioned, if we're so at our
[1:39:18] atmosphere and all of a sudden we're
[1:39:20] doing things that are causing certain
[1:39:23] things in the natural, we're walking in
[1:39:25] the carnal and then people start saying
[1:39:27] that guy, he is terrible at work. He's
[1:39:30] he's always sitting around. He's always
[1:39:32] on his phone and he starts talking about
[1:39:35] you in a way that causes him to curse
[1:39:38] you. That man will be
[1:39:40] cursed. What a sobriety. This is the
[1:39:44] eternal word of God. We need to be
[1:39:47] conscious of what we do and say like
[1:39:50] people, it's not just a minister or the
[1:39:52] pastor or an evangelist. They're hanging
[1:39:55] on your every word. Like what is he
[1:39:58] going to say? What is he going to say?
[1:40:00] If they knew the covenant that you were
[1:40:02] in, what is he going to say? What is he
[1:40:04] going to say? Oh
[1:40:07] my. It just should create a sobriety.
[1:40:10] You know, you're the final voice to the
[1:40:13] final age, the very bone of his bone and
[1:40:17] flesh of his
[1:40:23] flesh. But we want to answer the call
[1:40:25] today. We want to answer the call.
[1:40:28] And
[1:40:30] I know that God has called us for his
[1:40:33] purposes. you know, was quoted in the
[1:40:35] opening prayer, but we know that all
[1:40:38] things work together for good to those
[1:40:42] who love God. I believe there's those
[1:40:44] that love God in here tonight
[1:40:46] and are the called according to his
[1:40:49] purposes. Amen. And whom whom God did
[1:40:54] fornown, he did justify.
[1:40:57] And who he
[1:40:59] fornown, he also glorified.
[1:41:03] Amen. So, wherever you're at in the
[1:41:06] journey, if God called you, he's not one
[1:41:10] that's going to leave his work undone.
[1:41:12] Amen. So, you can rest in that. But,
[1:41:14] well, we'll just save this for another
[1:41:16] time. Maybe if we can invite the
[1:41:27] musicians. Yeah. I I tell you one thing
[1:41:29] I know that I know is um you know it
[1:41:33] doesn't matter if it was a youth camp or
[1:41:35] a special meeting. The moment that you
[1:41:38] open your mouth and you testify of what
[1:41:41] God did in your heart, I believe that
[1:41:43] it'll spark a fire in somebody's heart.
[1:41:46] So don't be ashamed even if it's the
[1:41:49] slightest little testimony. And I'll say
[1:41:52] this, this is kind of what I was going
[1:41:53] to read from, but this really struck my
[1:41:56] heart. And I'll just read it in closing,
[1:41:59] but you can let the Lord deal with you
[1:42:01] how you see fit. But you know, in 77,
[1:42:07] uh, paragraph 77 of that message, he
[1:42:09] says, "How are we going to get around
[1:42:11] it? There's so much makebelieve going
[1:42:14] on, sensations and different things like
[1:42:17] that. But when in your heart you believe
[1:42:20] it, when something has happened to you,
[1:42:25] that God did it and God's the only one
[1:42:29] that can do it. So God by grace and
[1:42:34] election put that in your heart to
[1:42:37] believe it. It wasn't there to begin
[1:42:40] with and you had you had no way to put
[1:42:44] it there. God placed it there and you
[1:42:47] answered the call. I want it to be
[1:42:50] something that you can grab a hold of
[1:42:53] that your faith when you know that God's
[1:42:56] did something in your heart. You didn't
[1:42:59] place it there. God placed it there. And
[1:43:02] so if God plays something in there to
[1:43:05] believe with part of the covenant,
[1:43:08] you're part of Abraham's seed. Amen. So
[1:43:10] you can rejoice. You can rise up and
[1:43:13] say, "God, touch my heart." And you can
[1:43:15] stand there and you don't you don't make
[1:43:18] sense of the testimony. You just tell it
[1:43:20] and watch how God will use it. Because
[1:43:22] he's he's wanting to use your testimony.
[1:43:25] That's why he called you. That's why he
[1:43:27] spilled his blood to sanctify your life.
[1:43:30] that you know when they were in the day
[1:43:32] of Pentecost and the outpouring of the
[1:43:34] spirit came on it gave them boldness. It
[1:43:36] gave them power and speech and that's
[1:43:38] what we want to do. We don't want to be
[1:43:40] afraid to testify of the works of God.
[1:43:42] Now if it was my works it can come into
[1:43:45] question but when God does something to
[1:43:47] the human heart who's going to stand
[1:43:48] against it? If God be for you who can be
[1:43:52] against you. Amen. Let us stand. Lord
[1:43:54] bless you.
[1:43:58] [Applause]
[1:44:02] Praise the Lord. Before we turn the
[1:44:04] service over to brother Billy and you
[1:44:07] know maybe there is something that God
[1:44:10] has spoken to your heart and you just
[1:44:12] want to say thank you Lord or lift up
[1:44:14] your hands and say I want more of that.
[1:44:15] I want more of that pure touch, that
[1:44:17] innocence of the Holy Spirit to deal
[1:44:20] with my heart and and that my atmosphere
[1:44:22] can be right, that God would be pleased
[1:44:24] to keep that dove leading and guiding.
[1:44:28] Amen. That's your desire. Let's pray
[1:44:31] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, what a
[1:44:35] privilege people that we are
[1:44:38] to Lord have the revealed truth of the
[1:44:42] hour. Lord to know that we know that we
[1:44:45] know that we didn't place ourselves here
[1:44:48] but you by your fornowledge Lord you
[1:44:51] chose us to be here in this end time
[1:44:54] Lord Lord to be shining lights of your
[1:44:58] love and the care that you have oh God
[1:45:02] to know that Lord your truth has come in
[1:45:05] this day to set us free
[1:45:08] and to turn oh God the enemy to light.
[1:45:13] Father, we just want to pray for those
[1:45:16] that lifted their hand and has need of
[1:45:19] you and once more of that pure sincerity
[1:45:23] and they want to be empowered to
[1:45:26] separate, oh God, like Father Abraham.
[1:45:29] Lord, we could even see in brother
[1:45:31] Brandham's life what you did. Lord, we
[1:45:34] just want to yield ourselves as Lord, we
[1:45:38] open our heart and lift our hands and
[1:45:40] say, "Lord, lead me. God, give me wisdom
[1:45:43] and revelation moving forward. Lord, to
[1:45:46] know that the eyes of the critic and the
[1:45:49] world, they're looking in. But oh God,
[1:45:52] Lord, let us not fear what man would do
[1:45:54] or say, but let our eyes stay directly
[1:45:56] on you and what you said, just
[1:45:59] committing our pastor. Lord, we know God
[1:46:03] that you've been so faithful to provide
[1:46:06] a shepherd that's concerned. And we just
[1:46:09] pray, Lord, bless him, Lord. He's
[1:46:12] labored and sacrificed. And we just ask
[1:46:15] that you would refresh him, restore him,
[1:46:17] Lord. May you give him good health and
[1:46:20] strength that he can continue to serve
[1:46:21] your people. Lord, we just know God is
[1:46:24] desire to see your people free and in
[1:46:28] fellowship with you. And so, we just
[1:46:30] commit him and the people to you for the
[1:46:33] glory of God. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:46:35] name. Amen. And let's sing this
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:45] together. Help me sing it. In your
[1:46:50] [Music]
[1:46:51] presence, that's where I am strong. In

[1:48:00] go your presence.
[1:48:05] Oh,
[1:48:12] heat, heat.
[1:48:18] [Music]
[1:48:28] That's where I
[1:48:32] belong
[1:48:35] your
[1:48:36] [Music]
[1:48:40] touch in the land of
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] the praises. Oh God.
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] Oh, where I want to go.
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:16] of
[1:49:17] darkness
[1:49:20] touch your
[1:49:33] presence. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:49:47] Oh, that's where I
[1:49:50] belong. We seeking your
[1:49:54] face and
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:08] you presence of
[1:50:11] God. Heat. Heat.
[1:50:21] Heat. Heat.
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:31] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:41] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:50:53] Oh, that's where
[1:51:10] I belong.
[1:51:18] In your
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] praise, in your presence, oh
[1:51:29] God, in your presence, oh God.
[1:51:35] Hallelujah.
[1:51:37] Amen. Did you enjoy that? Amen. I
[1:51:40] certainly did. I love what our brother
[1:51:42] said. He said, "We want to see people
[1:51:44] and treat them the way God sees them.
[1:51:47] Not through our own eyes of judgment,
[1:51:49] but the way that God's heart sees them.
[1:51:53] That we may be able to extend that same
[1:51:55] love that was extended to us. That same
[1:51:58] compassion of God and those same
[1:52:00] creative eyes. I could look at something
[1:52:02] that looks terrible and see potential in
[1:52:05] them. That's the kind of God we serve.
[1:52:07] Amen. For those that gave testimonies,
[1:52:10] certainly thankful. I believe somebody
[1:52:12] was strengthened by those testimonies.
[1:52:15] Amen. You know, when God does something
[1:52:16] for somebody, like our brother said,
[1:52:19] it's an anticipation for another to look
[1:52:21] and say that if God did that, he's the
[1:52:24] same God that I'm serving, he will do
[1:52:25] for them. He'll do for me the same.
[1:52:28] Because why? God is no respector of
[1:52:30] persons. He's only looking to his word.
[1:52:33] If we come to his word with faith, he
[1:52:35] will do the same exact thing. Amen. Once
[1:52:38] again, we appreciate all that we're able
[1:52:41] to go and and help with the camp and
[1:52:43] everything. and God certainly bless you.
[1:52:45] We thank you very much. Brother Gary, if
[1:52:47] you could just come and dismiss us
[1:52:48] tonight.
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:53:02] [Music]
[1:53:11] Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:53:14] [Music]
[1:53:17] Dear heavenly father, we just come
[1:53:19] before
[1:53:20] you at the closing of this service, Lord
[1:53:23] God, once again
[1:53:25] just how wonderful it is to be in your
[1:53:29] presence. Father God, I think
[1:53:33] about Lord, even the opportunity you
[1:53:35] gave me, Lord, to go to the camp this
[1:53:38] year, Lord.
[1:53:40] And Lord, sometimes things aren't always
[1:53:43] answered in 3 days later, Lord. But
[1:53:46] Father, we know we're time-tested
[1:53:48] memorials. Yes.
[1:53:52] And sometimes, Lord, you just simply
[1:53:53] want us to wait.
[1:53:57] Lord, will will we
[1:54:00] believe that you're going to do what you
[1:54:02] said you're going to do?
[1:54:06] Will we be patient and have the right
[1:54:11] attitude? Will we live the Christian
[1:54:14] life you've given
[1:54:15] [Music]
[1:54:17] us? Lord, I just ask that you would
[1:54:20] bless all those that went,
[1:54:23] Lord. All those that had an experience,
[1:54:25] Lord. May you just help us to fight. May
[1:54:27] you help us to
[1:54:29] feed. Lord, we thank you for the labor
[1:54:32] that brother Matthew put in, Lord God.
[1:54:36] Lord, just think of the testimony of all
[1:54:39] that you've done for
[1:54:45] him. We just ask that you would bless
[1:54:47] him. Bless the children, Lord. Bless the
[1:54:50] youth, Lord God. Bless this congregation
[1:54:52] for backing and supporting, Lord.
[1:54:55] Father, we're just so thankful for the
[1:54:58] things that you're doing in our lives.
[1:55:00] May you just give us revelation and help
[1:55:02] us to recognize what you want us to do
[1:55:04] with your word. We love you. We thank
[1:55:07] you. We ask that you just give us grace
[1:55:09] and mercy. In Jesus Christ's name we
[1:55:11] pray.
[1:55:12] Amen.
[1:55:14] Amen. Amen. God bless you at this mist.
[1:55:17] Don't forget the youth meeting on
[1:55:19] Friday. Amen. At 6 p.m. Oh Jesus on the
