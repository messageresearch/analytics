[25:46] your love in living flesh I see the Holy
[25:53] Spirit shining out through your children
[25:59] Lord it just makes me want to grow and
[26:03] be a part of it
[26:05] and this evening father we just asked
[26:13] that we would move closer and unity with
[26:19] one another and with you that our
[26:26] understanding of your word would
[26:30] increase and the knowledge of your will
[26:34] will grow in to a deep loving
[26:39] relationship we ask for you through your
[26:44] word this evening to do for us
[26:47] exceedingly and abundantly above that
[26:51] which we could ask or think we ask your
[26:55] grace to hold us and keep us father we
[27:01] ask that forgiveness would always reign
[27:06] in our hearts and in our minds we love
[27:11] you this evening and we're grateful to
[27:15] you we're grateful father for your love
[27:18] and we're grateful for one another
[27:20] and we certainly invite you to be our
[27:24] portion this evening we ask all these
[27:27] things Lord Jesus of the Father in your
[27:31] precious name we pray amen amen
[27:35] bless you this evening I'm real excited
[27:38] to have brother Randy back ministering
[27:42] with us this evening as you know that
[27:47] brother
[27:48] Randy's probably in the top 5% of
[27:52] smartness in the United States and and
[27:55] he went on and was able to you'll agree
[27:59] with that right brother amen
[28:01] he never disagrees with the pastor so
[28:04] I'm a glad I can say that I really I
[28:07] think everybody in here is this your
[28:09] genius because the world's not smart
[28:12] enough to know what's going on and
[28:14] you're all inand elect and get it go in
[28:17] the rapture that's as bright as you can
[28:20] get right there that is sheer genius and
[28:23] I know brother Randy's part of that so
[28:26] we know how smart everybody really is
[28:29] that loves the Lord amen the fear of God
[28:33] is the beginning of wisdom but he he
[28:38] accomplished a great deal he's went
[28:41] through severe training and and growth
[28:44] and all those wonderful things to become
[28:47] an air-traffic controller which is one
[28:49] of the more difficult and stressful jobs
[28:52] and and and so we have an air traffic
[28:56] controller with us we have a pilot with
[28:58] us so between the two of them I'm sure
[29:01] we can get on the right path and get to
[29:03] where we need to go so we're glory about
[29:06] that but I know you're gonna enjoy
[29:07] brother Randy's ministry he's proven
[29:12] through his life that he's a believer
[29:15] and I know the love of God is shed
[29:19] abroad in his heart and so I'm just
[29:22] happy for this evening I'm and so we're
[29:25] just going to sing only believe that's
[29:29] our national anthem I'd like to sing
[29:32] national anthem is our brother comes and
[29:35] ministers the word I'll be recited aside
[29:40] let's really pull on brother Randy let's
[29:44] just suck everything out of them Intel
[29:47] he's a sponge that's been wrung so dry
[29:51] then he'll just have to run and get a
[29:54] drink of water
[29:55] hey man so I just want I'm a workaholic
[29:58] but I want you to work brother Randy to
[30:01] death tonight every time a little
[30:03] thought comes to you just pull on it
[30:05] pull on it pull on it and so where he
[30:09] gets to the place he doesn't even know
[30:10] what he's saying you're just pulling the
[30:14] ministry right out of them this evening
[30:16] you believe we can do that I believe we
[30:19] can do that because I believe were God's
[30:21] children and I believe we're hungry and
[30:24] God has chosen our brother to feed us
[30:26] tonight we thirst and he's chosen him to
[30:30] get the waters of life tonight
[30:32] let's see only believe as our brother
[30:34] comes to minister the word
[30:38] [Music]
[31:24] that same Jesus is here because he is
[31:28] [Music]
[32:09] [Music]
[32:16] amen god bless you this evening it's a
[32:20] privilege to stand before the people of
[32:23] God it's a humbling thing that you know
[32:27] brother David would have confidence to
[32:30] stand behind the pulpit we know we know
[32:33] we hesitate you know they say his pulpit
[32:36] but we know it's the Lord's pulpit but
[32:38] the Lord's given him stewardship of that
[32:40] and just appreciate the Lord that's
[32:44] Brotherhood it's not gonna be hard for
[32:45] people to squeeze things out of me
[32:47] because I sweat a lot so I've been doing
[32:52] a lot doing walking for exercise and I
[32:54] go out and it's really hot here and I
[32:56] weighed myself this week before and
[32:58] after and I lost eight pounds in two
[33:00] hours
[33:01] just from sweating it all out so by the
[33:05] grace of God let's turn let's turn in
[33:10] our Bibles to a couple scriptures here
[33:12] let's go to Romans chapter 1 verse 16
[33:29] just appreciate everything that the Lord
[33:31] is doing you know we're seeing the say
[33:34] those cogs those wheels of prophecy seem
[33:36] to be turning faster and faster you know
[33:39] and I thank the Lord for it because we
[33:41] know that that great machine of God that
[33:43] he's put in place before the foundation
[33:45] of the world has got one thing in mind
[33:47] for us and that's a rapture and so I
[33:50] just am so thankful that you know we're
[33:53] able to see these things by the grace of
[33:55] God Romans chapter 1 verse 16 enough if
[33:58] you just want to keep it in mind we're
[34:00] gonna turn also to Habakkuk chapter 2
[34:03] but we'll start here and we'll just
[34:07] start at verse 15 in the book of Romans
[34:10] chapter 1 so as much as ended as is in
[34:14] me I am ready to preach the gospel to
[34:16] you that are at Rome also for I am not
[34:20] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[34:22] is the power of God unto salvation to
[34:25] every one that believeth to the Jew
[34:27] first and also to the Greek for their'n
[34:30] is the righteousness of God revealed
[34:31] from faith to faith as it is written the
[34:34] just shall live by faith
[34:36] and we'll turn over to Habakkuk chapter
[34:38] 2 you know I'm trying to get before the
[34:47] Lord and see what he might want you to
[34:49] say and so many times it kind of feels
[34:52] like not that I can see these things but
[34:55] it kind of feels like I'm praying before
[34:57] the Lord trying to think of a you know
[34:59] the Lord will drop different thoughts
[35:00] and you just sometimes it feels like
[35:03] there's just a bunch of threads laying
[35:04] there because we know that the scripture
[35:06] is just infinite and just pray that the
[35:08] Lord would help us to grab the right
[35:10] thread this evening and follow it
[35:11] wherever he would have us to go and
[35:14] we'll just read starting at verse one
[35:19] said I will stand upon my watch and set
[35:22] me upon the tower and will watch to see
[35:25] what he will say unto me and what I
[35:28] shall answer when I am reproved and the
[35:31] Lord answered me and said write the
[35:32] vision and make it plain upon tables
[35:34] that he may run that readeth it for the
[35:38] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[35:41] at the end it shall speak
[35:43] are we at the end time I believe we've
[35:45] heard the vision speak in our day and
[35:48] not lie though it Terry wait for it
[35:52] because it will surely come it will not
[35:55] tarry and we'll just read verse 4 also
[35:58] because I just realized now it ties
[35:59] exactly in with the scripture we just
[36:01] read said Behold his soul which is
[36:03] lifted up is not upright in him but the
[36:05] just shall live by his faith amen let's
[36:09] just buy our heads and word of Prayer
[36:10] Heavenly Father Lord we just come humbly
[36:13] before you Lord Lord God knowing that
[36:17] before the foundation of the world you
[36:18] are dangerous to this place o God
[36:20] nothing that happens in our lives is a
[36:23] surprise to you O God you Lord your the
[36:26] the great I am the Lord that was from
[36:29] the beginning and is now and shall ever
[36:32] be O God and as we just come before you
[36:34] this evening Lord we just pray that
[36:36] you'd get all of us out of the way Lord
[36:37] as lord I don't want to speak my own
[36:39] thoughts Lord it wouldn't profit anybody
[36:42] to hear the thoughts of a man but O God
[36:43] if we could just get out of the way and
[36:45] just hear just a word from you Lord
[36:47] would be enough Lord to get us to where
[36:49] we need to go o God Lord I just think of
[36:52] the day that you spoke those words Lord
[36:56] when you said unless you eat the flesh
[36:58] of the Son of Man and drink his blood
[36:59] you you have no part in me and so many
[37:02] turned and went away and Lord do turn to
[37:04] your disciples and said will you go to
[37:06] and Peter could only say Lord where else
[37:09] would we go for you alone have the words
[37:11] of eternal life and Lord God we can say
[37:14] that this evening out God we don't
[37:16] understand maybe things that happen in
[37:18] our lives or there's different things
[37:20] Lord that occur maybe we don't always
[37:22] understand it or see it the way we ought
[37:23] to O God but where else would we go
[37:25] Lord Jesus you're the only one that has
[37:27] eternal life of God and will follow you
[37:29] Lord to the ends of the earth Lord we
[37:32] would go by your grace Lord and tonight
[37:34] we just pray that you would have your
[37:35] preeminence in the service Lord may you
[37:37] speak to your people get me out of the
[37:40] way Lord anoint the speaker anoint the
[37:43] hear Lord let your perfect will be done
[37:45] Lord and may you get glory unto yourself
[37:47] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[37:50] you may be seated forgive me I just get
[37:54] really nervous but you know we're just
[37:57] trusting in the Lord you know every
[37:59] breath that we take we don't realize is
[38:00] an act of faith
[38:02] it just it becomes so normal to us that
[38:05] we we don't even realize that we're
[38:06] doing it and I believe that the the God
[38:09] is looking for us to get to a place in
[38:11] him that we can just make living for him
[38:14] like breathing hey man where it was just
[38:17] in him we live and breathing and him we
[38:19] live and move and have our being every
[38:21] breath we take is by his grace I just
[38:25] maybe would like to speak you know I had
[38:28] this thought in my mind and and then the
[38:31] Lord kind of turned it I want to heard
[38:33] what we had ministered this Sunday
[38:35] morning and that's what we read the
[38:39] scripture there in Romans chapter 1
[38:40] verse 16 on the gospel it says you know
[38:44] a brother David was preaching and talked
[38:47] about the gospel not just being in Word
[38:49] I'm gonna I'm gonna read this quote just
[38:52] real quick before I forget because
[38:53] sometimes I forget things
[38:56] because I just happened to Lourdes kind
[38:57] of led me to this message and I've been
[38:59] listening to it a couple times and it
[39:02] hit this point in the message it's it's
[39:04] the five definite identifications of the
[39:06] true Church of the Living God and I
[39:09] heard this and I said my goodness that
[39:11] is if that isn't what we just heard on
[39:13] Sunday I don't know what is and it just
[39:14] felt so more its fed alive and brother
[39:17] Branham says in that sermon he says how
[39:19] many knows what the gospel is he says
[39:22] not the word that we put that kind of in
[39:24] quotation marks he says not the word
[39:26] Paul said the gospel come to us not in
[39:30] word only but through the power and
[39:32] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[39:34] the gospel is the power of God to make
[39:37] the word act what it says it'll do
[39:40] preach the gospel all the world preach
[39:44] the gospel to just the white people or
[39:46] just the brown yellow/black to every
[39:49] creature amen
[39:50] every creature you believe that means
[39:52] that amen I believe it means that I've
[39:55] seen God baffle a bull one day I've seen
[39:58] him cause Hornets not to sting I seen
[40:01] him raise up an opossum that had been
[40:03] laying to head all night
[40:04] every creature the gospel will take
[40:08] effect upon anything that you ask he
[40:10] says you say that's wrong brother
[40:12] branham he says it isn't wrong
[40:14] jesus said to that tree cursed be you
[40:16] know man eat from you from henceforth
[40:18] and the gospel was preached to that tree
[40:21] hey in the head
[40:22] I feel religious right now I kind of
[40:23] feel it too since to every creature amen
[40:26] preach it to what every creature oh if
[40:29] we just had time for these things and
[40:31] then it's just skipping a few paragraphs
[40:33] but he says down here he says the last
[40:35] commission go into the world and preach
[40:37] the gospel he that believed in to end
[40:38] his baptize and I like what he says here
[40:40] this is what just struck me he says let
[40:43] me quote it the way it should be the way
[40:45] it's broke down go ye into all the world
[40:47] and to every nation and demonstrate the
[40:51] power of the Holy Ghost amen
[40:54] he that believeth on this and his
[40:57] baptized shall be saved he that denies
[40:59] it will be damned these signs will
[41:01] follow them that believe they lay hands
[41:03] on the sick they shall recover they'll
[41:05] cast out devils they'll speak with new
[41:06] tongues this will be the signs that
[41:09] follows the last verse said and they
[41:11] returned the Lord working with them
[41:12] confirming his word with signs following
[41:14] and the last little bit just in the last
[41:18] paragraph here and he talks about it
[41:20] we've heard this kind of quote said many
[41:21] different times and brother branham's
[41:23] mentioned it many different ways and the
[41:25] same kind of idea he says brother
[41:27] Branham we look at it all these churches
[41:29] seeing what they're doing and there's no
[41:30] doubt we see that today thousands and
[41:33] thousands of them he says that's grafted
[41:35] vines he says now you can graph to sit
[41:37] your feet you can take an orange tree
[41:39] put a lemon on it and it'll grow that's
[41:41] what you that's what man grafted in and
[41:44] these organizations is what man grafted
[41:46] in it's a lemon tree all the time it'll
[41:47] grow because it's stuck out in the
[41:49] church name but let me tell you if that
[41:51] tree ever puts forth another branch
[41:53] itself a toe bear an orange and if the
[41:55] power of God can we say it the way he
[41:59] just kind of explained it to us if the
[42:01] gospel could I say it like that if the
[42:03] gospel would ever put forth another
[42:05] church it'll be another Pentecost and
[42:08] another book of Acts will be wrote
[42:10] behind it because it's the Church of God
[42:13] and I just couldn't help but get struck
[42:16] when I heard that it really stirred me
[42:18] up
[42:18] because I kind of had the thought that I
[42:20] kind of had and my heart and I guess
[42:23] just to give it a title because that's
[42:25] kind of what everybody seems to do for
[42:26] the most part except for the David is
[42:29] that is I just kind of had an idea a
[42:31] thought of stepping into the vision you
[42:39] know the world we see the world just
[42:41] going absolutely insane and I'm not even
[42:44] gonna get into the politics because
[42:45] there's no use in it you know there's no
[42:47] use in discussing politics because it's
[42:49] just that's the domain of the devil
[42:51] anyway we know the Prophet said that
[42:54] those are his kingdoms that's the way
[42:55] it's gonna be he already had possession
[42:57] of it but the Lord said you can have
[42:59] that because I'll come here to it in the
[43:00] Millennium amen but we know the world is
[43:04] insane I mean we're living it right now
[43:08] we're seeing it around us and what we're
[43:12] in the time gross darkness upon the
[43:16] people darkness that can be felt I mean
[43:20] I mean I if even if you're not spiritual
[43:23] you say oh I'm not a spiritual person
[43:25] you can feel it just everywhere you go
[43:28] when you when you walk outside and you
[43:30] go to the store and you see everything
[43:32] that you're seeing and and Lord forgive
[43:35] me sometimes just lord help me to get my
[43:37] thoughts you know get his thoughts in
[43:39] the right place here but you know I if I
[43:43] could just say it this way I often
[43:46] looked listened to the message and I
[43:48] hear the things that brother Branham
[43:49] says and if I could maybe like they say
[43:54] take the other side of it just for an
[43:56] example i standing in their shoes
[43:59] looking back at history
[44:00] I could understand naturally why so many
[44:04] people would have thought he was crazy
[44:06] especially when we see what we see today
[44:08] you know brother branham's talking about
[44:11] the the women just bobbing off their
[44:12] hair and going around naked and seeing
[44:14] all these things and if you look back at
[44:16] the 50s in the 60s and everything
[44:19] compared to what we have today the the
[44:22] people listening to what brother Branham
[44:24] was saying would say this guy's crazy
[44:25] it's not that bad but we understand a
[44:28] prophet was seeing things in a way
[44:31] he saw the seed form of those spirits
[44:35] that were there and he was seeing you
[44:37] know he could see past the veil of time
[44:40] that he was living in I'm sorry I gotta
[44:41] take this off these things never fit me
[44:43] very well forgive me I just know the way
[44:47] I fit into clothes if I move around too
[44:49] much you're just gonna hear it and it's
[44:50] gonna rip off it's just always been that
[44:53] way for me but but but he was seeing
[44:56] that seed form you know that prophet
[44:59] that gift of a prophet being able to see
[45:01] kind of go beyond as we could say we
[45:03] call it the curtain of time and see what
[45:06] future present events had happened and
[45:09] seeing the future events to come that
[45:12] that spirit of God that could lift him
[45:14] up beyond the mortal coil and could see
[45:16] those things there's no wonder though
[45:18] that the people might have thought he
[45:19] was crazy seeing surely I these women
[45:22] aren't walking around completely naked
[45:24] no doubt that there were some there that
[45:25] were you know the men maybe didn't look
[45:28] as bad as they do now they say well it
[45:32] doesn't look that bad compared to what
[45:34] it was a few years ago but he could see
[45:37] the end of the thing from the beginning
[45:39] could see what the fruit of that seed
[45:42] was going to bring what what the tree
[45:44] was going to grow up to be what what the
[45:46] fruits would put forth at the end time
[45:48] he was seeing our day so when we can
[45:52] look see hindsight is 20/20 as they say
[45:54] so when we when we can look back at the
[45:56] message now if we could even put
[45:58] ourselves into those shoes to what they
[46:01] would have seen we know by the grace of
[46:03] God we still would have believed it
[46:05] because the the Spirit of God in us as
[46:07] we heard even from our pastor this
[46:10] Sunday that seed that we talked about so
[46:12] much it can't do anything but believe
[46:14] the word it may not have been able to
[46:16] understand two things the way we can't
[46:18] now but I can see when brother Branham
[46:22] talked about come would I believe it's
[46:23] coming up the escalator and and hearing
[46:25] the noises in the groaning and seeing
[46:27] the women looking like they were
[46:29] gangrene everywhere and all the makeup
[46:31] and things surely we see that now so
[46:34] alive we're seeing the prophecy being
[46:38] made manifest more and more all the time
[46:41] and in the thing we don't even realized
[46:43] as we talk about we're talking about
[46:45] stepping into the vision and we don't
[46:48] realize sometimes that worked we're
[46:51] living in that vision right now that he
[46:53] was seen when he was preaching these
[46:57] things and prophesying these things were
[46:59] we are actually walking step by step
[47:01] actually entering into the vision that
[47:05] brother Branham was seen if he if we
[47:09] could bring him back right now and say
[47:10] brother Branham what do you think about
[47:12] it he'd say that's exactly what I was
[47:14] talking about there's no doubt about it
[47:17] you know and so many people would have
[47:19] looked at him you're crazy I don't see
[47:20] every woman in the world wearing pants
[47:22] they don't even have the courtesy to do
[47:25] that anymore they don't wear anything
[47:27] anymore and he was talking about it then
[47:30] the men don't look like men anymore that
[47:34] now it's gotten so bad we know that what
[47:36] the world is now to where they can say
[47:39] one's one and ones the other and this is
[47:40] that you could be whatever you want that
[47:43] completely cast aside even what natural
[47:46] reasoning would be but the scripture
[47:48] says they would do it it said they would
[47:50] even cast aside natural affections we're
[47:54] living in that vision and it's so easy
[47:58] to see the negative side of that vision
[48:01] because we're seeing the world
[48:02] i-i-i-i've you know I just go in here
[48:05] because this cuz when I was the Lord's
[48:07] leading but I I was listening to a guy
[48:09] the other day and he's kind of talks
[48:11] about some political things and stuff
[48:12] and I heard something that just
[48:15] absolutely chilled me you know and I
[48:17] meant to go get it and just print it out
[48:19] and send it some people and maybe I'll
[48:21] look it up again but apparently there
[48:22] was an archbishop from Rome like a
[48:25] really high up archbishop from Rome who
[48:28] sent a letter to Donald Trump and the
[48:32] guy read the whole letter on the air and
[48:34] everything and and if you listen you
[48:37] know without a spiritual aspect it
[48:39] sounds so good but he could he goes into
[48:42] talking about how the world's going
[48:44] crazy and and the people are going
[48:47] insane and a lot of things that you
[48:50] could even agree I heard some of the
[48:52] things I said that's actually right he's
[48:54] right out about certain things why
[48:55] because Satan he puts the truth in there
[48:59] he doesn't always just cast aside the
[49:01] truth but he's adulterated adulterated
[49:03] of just a little bit because remember
[49:05] we're going back to the Garden of Eden
[49:06] again and in the Garden of Eden he
[49:08] didn't just come out and say just
[49:10] worship me he said half God not said he
[49:13] brought the word first and then he
[49:15] slides in that that little devil that
[49:18] little serpent and but the thing that
[49:21] the thing that got me was that just
[49:23] right away just kind of they say my
[49:25] intent is good who kind of went up it's
[49:27] a while okay this is but it goes to show
[49:30] the insanity of the world is one of the
[49:32] first things in the letter he said was
[49:34] that we know that the children of light
[49:37] are more than the children of darkness I
[49:40] said well you lying devil because we
[49:42] know that's not the word he said mean we
[49:45] know the scripture says but more of the
[49:48] children of the bondwoman are the free
[49:50] I saw it you lyin devil you're right
[49:52] there but the rest of it see he throws
[49:54] that thing in right there many people
[49:56] wouldn't know their scripture don't know
[49:57] their word would just they go right into
[50:01] because it does sound so good and but
[50:04] the reason I say that is because it's so
[50:06] easy to look on the negative side
[50:07] because we're surrounded by remember he
[50:10] said that that little that predestinated
[50:12] number he said she'd be a small little
[50:13] group but the thing is is there is a
[50:18] vision for the people of God in this day
[50:22] there is a vision that God has not only
[50:26] just for the bride but for your life
[50:29] he's got something for you
[50:32] he's got a life that can live through
[50:36] you he's got a work for you to do
[50:39] whether you be old young small you know
[50:44] sister brother doesn't matter you have a
[50:47] part to play because you're part of the
[50:50] body with with the body can't you can't
[50:54] go without a part of your body the body
[50:55] of Christ will be a hole it will be
[50:58] firmly and faintly joint together it
[51:02] won't be missing one thing you know and
[51:06] I just I can't I thought about it I just
[51:09] you know we've
[51:11] the world sometimes I almost get I say
[51:16] jealous but if you if you understand it
[51:19] the way I mean it jealous of the world
[51:21] because they so easily fall into the
[51:25] vision that Satan has for them they so
[51:29] easily just go right with that spirit
[51:32] the world that just swept up in it one
[51:35] thing comes and they'll just whoop they
[51:37] just go right with it why because it's
[51:39] eat is Satan spirits easy to get into
[51:41] now it's everywhere they bumped it's
[51:44] bombarding the flesh and the people out
[51:47] there in the world they just Satan throw
[51:49] something at them and they just go right
[51:51] with it Satan throw something else at
[51:54] them they just go right with it
[51:56] they they see the thing is and Satan's
[51:58] got him convinced that it's not even a
[51:59] spiritual thing it's just it's just the
[52:02] way life is because they can't their
[52:05] carnal mind is enmity with God it can't
[52:08] even comprehend the things of God and
[52:11] because of that I still remember these
[52:14] probably couple years ago when brother
[52:15] David preached in and it's just stuck
[52:17] with me ever since how they talked about
[52:19] you haft
[52:19] he brought up the quarter brother
[52:21] branham said he said you have to know
[52:23] that the devil is real and you recognize
[52:26] him real and see it it's just like the
[52:30] you know we know that the devil is
[52:32] running to and fro and it's so easy to
[52:35] see that but the devil what does he do
[52:37] he comes and he blinds us to God in our
[52:40] midst right now he tries to take you out
[52:45] of that spiritual place where the work
[52:49] of God can be done in your life he tries
[52:51] to draw you out from the presence of God
[52:54] just like the Garden of Eden he tries to
[52:56] entice he who tries to throw little
[52:58] things here and there why because he
[53:00] knows the devil knows the word better
[53:02] than you do he knows he knows the
[53:05] message better than you do he knows the
[53:07] quotes backwards and forwards and what
[53:10] did we know what's the what's the quote
[53:11] leaves all the time if the true church
[53:13] could get the true revelation of the two
[53:15] spirits in the framework of the church
[53:16] see and if we can recognize and resist
[53:20] the spirit of the devil
[53:23] see he comes to church just as much as
[53:25] you do more than a lot of us he's here
[53:31] every service why because he's a
[53:34] faithful adversary and he he's a good
[53:36] adversary he's always there to puppet
[53:40] you and you have to recognize that his
[53:43] only goal is to keep you from getting to
[53:48] the place that God has for you in your
[53:49] life and you've got to recognize that
[53:53] the thing that God has for you is his
[53:56] word if I could say this way it is that
[53:59] gospel that brother David spoke about
[54:02] this Sunday that we just read it is the
[54:04] power to demonstrate the Word of God
[54:07] living in a man today people sometimes
[54:13] we try to get these deep revelations and
[54:16] they're great there's nothing wrong with
[54:18] that but if we could get one revelation
[54:21] about brother Branham you know the
[54:24] Prophet is that God could take a fallen
[54:30] man and work through him so powerfully
[54:33] that the world would think that he was
[54:36] Jesus Christ himself that there were
[54:37] people who thought that that and I've
[54:42] said this before many times
[54:44] a long time ago I'm sure but it is in my
[54:48] heart so strong I can't help but say it
[54:50] again
[54:51] the devil has got it in our minds that
[54:54] brother Branham is and I say brother
[54:58] Branham is in the life that he lived not
[55:01] the man we get rid of the man in that
[55:04] sense we want the life that that life
[55:09] that was in brother Branham is
[55:11] unattainable because you're not a
[55:15] prophet true may I mean we may have some
[55:19] among us some minor ones for all I know
[55:22] God didn't stop working God's got those
[55:25] gifts they're still out there
[55:29] but he the devil puts it in your mind oh
[55:32] you can't achieve that you can't achieve
[55:34] that life cuz you're not a prophet he
[55:37] makes it somewhat attainable but I'm
[55:39] here to tell you that that life that he
[55:43] lived that we so many times almost
[55:45] glorified to a point of idolatry that
[55:50] depth we because we put her off the man
[55:51] and it really put it off the life of
[55:53] Jesus Christ and put it on the man but
[55:56] the life that he lived is not only
[55:59] attainable it is what is required in
[56:03] this day that is the life required of
[56:07] you and I and we need to get in to the
[56:11] spirit of the vision that was preached
[56:14] to us through this message to see that
[56:17] the gospel the power of God can live in
[56:21] you and me every single day I'm
[56:26] preaching to myself because we're
[56:30] blinded so many times to it because of
[56:32] our own faults because we live in this
[56:35] flesh nobody knows the secrets of your
[56:38] flesh like you do nobody knows those
[56:41] things that you struggle with like you
[56:43] do you're the one that has to wake up
[56:45] every day and look yourself in the
[56:46] mirror and the devil's right there to
[56:49] say you ain't nothing how could you
[56:52] possibly serve God in that condition but
[56:55] because you say what I've been serving
[56:57] the Lord for so long it should get
[56:58] better and better and better but that's
[56:59] not true
[57:00] it will never be that way why I think
[57:03] about the story I don't remember names
[57:05] I'm terrible but you'll know the story
[57:07] I'm talking about about the the preacher
[57:09] who had the dream that he died and was
[57:11] going up towards that light and remember
[57:13] what was it as he got closer and closer
[57:16] and closer to that light all the things
[57:19] that he thought weren't so bad those
[57:22] little shady deals those little
[57:24] attitudes that he had they began to
[57:26] darken they became to become so obvious
[57:30] and so is it with us that was just an
[57:35] example these things weren't set in a
[57:36] vacuum
[57:37] they're said for our edification
[57:40] why because the closer you get to the
[57:42] Lord the more those little things that
[57:45] you thought you could get away with
[57:46] before become more darkened and evil to
[57:50] you and the devils right senator accuse
[57:53] you no matter how far you've come
[57:57] he's there to tell you you can't go any
[58:00] farther I'm could you how could you do
[58:01] that
[58:03] praise the Lord for that because I say
[58:06] devil you just exposed yourself now I
[58:09] know when I got a cut out next amen
[58:14] yes Lord see the scripture says that the
[58:18] Lord said he'd take the wise in his own
[58:20] craftiness see the devil thinks he's so
[58:23] smart well you did this and you did that
[58:25] well yeah that's true
[58:27] oh maybe it was even something you
[58:28] didn't think was so bad before well
[58:30] thank you thanks devil you just exposed
[58:32] my next conquest you exposed the next
[58:36] part of the land and I'm about to go
[58:38] chop your head off hey man there's a
[58:41] vision for the people of God in this
[58:44] hour to live and it was shown through
[58:47] the life of William Branham it was a
[58:49] life of overcoming and was a life full
[58:53] of mistakes I thank the Lord for a
[58:57] prophet that could be honest enough to
[58:59] get up here and tell you things that
[59:01] would embarrass him that would make no
[59:04] doubt throw from a pride standpoint you
[59:07] wouldn't want to say people are looking
[59:10] T could you imagine the pressure he knew
[59:14] that there were people who knew he was a
[59:16] prophet and yet the Lord would put it on
[59:19] his heart to come up and bare all of his
[59:22] faults before the people why because
[59:26] it's to show that he was just a man just
[59:29] like Paul he was a man of like passions
[59:31] why but the grace of God was sufficient
[59:34] for him
[59:36] it's sufficient for you and that light
[59:39] it's not just this bar that we look at
[59:42] and say oh I only I could do it but I
[59:45] can't because I'm I'm not this or I'm
[59:47] not that know that life it's the only
[59:50] thing that will get us out of here it's
[59:56] the only thing that will do it the Holy
[59:59] Ghost the life of God in you is the only
[1:00:02] thing that's coming out of here that's
[1:00:07] all that can go cuz it's got to be like
[1:00:10] him this flesh can't do it your thoughts
[1:00:15] can't do it your own your own intentions
[1:00:19] those are great there's that's great and
[1:00:22] sometimes I feel like we need to
[1:00:23] actually trust that more trust the Lord
[1:00:27] in you I love what brother David
[1:00:31] preached it I am just put like it's a
[1:00:33] piggybacking off of what he preached but
[1:00:34] I thought about I said you know what the
[1:00:36] devil is like no you shouldn't do that
[1:00:37] they're just gonna think you're reap
[1:00:38] reaching when you preach I said you know
[1:00:39] what devil the Prophet said when
[1:00:42] someone's got the ball you get out in
[1:00:44] front you block for the guy with the
[1:00:45] ball so I'm gonna block for the guy with
[1:00:48] the ball but the thing is the devil gets
[1:00:53] us so caught up in it and now we sit
[1:00:56] there and say well I can't do it this
[1:00:57] and that you're always making excuses
[1:00:58] but what did brother David say was right
[1:01:01] towards the end authority said do all
[1:01:02] that's in your heart why because when
[1:01:07] the Holy Ghost is in you and your
[1:01:10] intentions are right and and the word
[1:01:14] doesn't say anything against it do you
[1:01:17] think it's a devil telling you to go
[1:01:18] pray for your brother or sister but
[1:01:21] we'll reason ourselves right out of it
[1:01:23] in that right oh the Lord will put it on
[1:01:27] your heart just out of nowhere you know
[1:01:29] brother David you know brother David jr.
[1:01:32] he's I just for some reason I got him on
[1:01:34] my heart maybe I should text him and see
[1:01:35] how he's doing and just tell him I'm
[1:01:37] praying for him oh well he just kind of
[1:01:39] think you're being weird or something
[1:01:40] that that's you don't realize that's the
[1:01:41] devil and you and you you he's got the
[1:01:46] devil's got us in the flesh I say it
[1:01:48] only in the flesh he's
[1:01:49] I'm so trained to trust our reasoning
[1:01:54] because from the womb that we were
[1:01:56] taught to trust but to trust our own
[1:02:00] reasoning that we will go the complete
[1:02:02] opposite way that God has us to go and
[1:02:05] we'll be completely confident that
[1:02:07] that's where we should be going
[1:02:09] and I just using that as a simple
[1:02:11] example I what about the sister that
[1:02:13] brother branham tells the testimony but
[1:02:15] before the service the sister has the
[1:02:17] child who was sick and the sister felt a
[1:02:20] pull on her heart to go pray for that
[1:02:22] sister it said but she's what does she
[1:02:25] have she had a battle inside of her
[1:02:27] though I said oh but she wants to have
[1:02:29] brother branham pray for her not even
[1:02:32] realizing she was getting ready to step
[1:02:35] into the vision that she there is a pool
[1:02:39] there getting ready to step into that
[1:02:42] vision why because her hands were just
[1:02:45] as good as brother branham's hands if I
[1:02:48] could say this way brother Branham said
[1:02:49] it he said in a roundabout way I'm not
[1:02:52] trying to put words into his mouth but
[1:02:53] he basically said her hands were better
[1:02:55] than his hands because I just read the
[1:02:57] court I didn't get a chance to print it
[1:02:58] out or write it down but he said he said
[1:03:00] because that sister would have more
[1:03:02] compassion than I could have ever had
[1:03:04] for her because she might have she had
[1:03:07] children so in that moment God anointed
[1:03:11] that sister to step into that spot and
[1:03:14] that was the will of God but how many
[1:03:17] times will we be in that position and we
[1:03:19] would reason ourselves right out of it
[1:03:21] oh and she's got a prayer card you know
[1:03:23] that's the prophets place to do it or
[1:03:25] that's the pastor's place to do it I
[1:03:27] guarantee you brother David would be
[1:03:28] delighted to know that the that the
[1:03:31] people in the church are praying one for
[1:03:32] another
[1:03:36] you know because God works through his
[1:03:39] people to his people the barneys Finley
[1:03:43] joined together you know and we've got
[1:03:46] to be able to see the vision for
[1:03:48] ourselves we got to be able to walk into
[1:03:51] that vision amen you know but so many
[1:03:55] times are our thoughts and God's
[1:03:59] thoughts get so far apart
[1:04:01] you know and I think we could run
[1:04:06] through I'll just run through a couple
[1:04:07] examples here and we know these examples
[1:04:09] why because what happens is we're not
[1:04:12] getting into the spirit I have a quote
[1:04:17] here I just read this quote real quick
[1:04:19] just because again it sits on my heart
[1:04:21] and mine to read it and if I don't
[1:04:23] mm-hmm he says this is from the the
[1:04:28] message the hand of the Lord came upon
[1:04:29] him and I because I was thinking about
[1:04:33] it you know so many times we listen to a
[1:04:34] lot of messages and things and in our
[1:04:36] our mortal our little brains here can't
[1:04:39] you know we can't hope to reason
[1:04:41] ourselves or try to just figure it all
[1:04:43] out we have to rely upon the Lord he
[1:04:45] made us that way to rely upon him if he
[1:04:48] could rely upon our own our own power
[1:04:51] our own intellect then what what did
[1:04:53] Jesus Christ died for and raised again
[1:04:56] amen but I've been but it is so this so
[1:04:59] just touched me because this was the
[1:05:02] exact thought I had and then I just
[1:05:04] happened to look and I happened it just
[1:05:06] sprang right out and he's talking about
[1:05:09] Elijah he said there they stood before
[1:05:15] the Prophet he got his righteous
[1:05:17] indignation up to you holding his people
[1:05:19] to Calvinist Peter Presbyterian Baptist
[1:05:21] he just got plainly got angry that's all
[1:05:24] he says all right he got stirred up he
[1:05:26] looked over it Joe Harmon said why don't
[1:05:28] you go down to your own cold former
[1:05:30] church get you some preachers down there
[1:05:31] to ask this for you already really got
[1:05:33] his dandruff up said why don't you go
[1:05:35] down to your mother's prophets in your
[1:05:36] daddy's prophets yea kindly a halfway
[1:05:38] borderline why don't you go down to your
[1:05:40] own church he said why'd you come here
[1:05:42] he said but the Lord that's called us
[1:05:43] out here together and Elijah with his
[1:05:46] dandruff all up he said if it wasn't for
[1:05:47] that I respected Jehoshaphat I wouldn't
[1:05:49] even look at you he said but he really
[1:05:51] got out of humor didn't he now when he
[1:05:53] did he got now when he did he got was
[1:05:57] all a plate when he got to a place like
[1:05:58] that he's in no condition for the spirit
[1:06:01] to come on but he said bring me a
[1:06:03] minstrel he says not even people that
[1:06:05] don't believe in playing music in church
[1:06:06] I wonder what you're gonna do with that
[1:06:08] he says but here he comes said bring me
[1:06:11] a minstrel go get out there
[1:06:14] in all the soldiers and see who can play
[1:06:16] the harp and play the stringed
[1:06:17] instruments and everything and get in
[1:06:18] here and play old-time religion for me
[1:06:20] or something so he get in there and
[1:06:22] here's the point we're getting to and
[1:06:24] they got in there remember because he's
[1:06:26] to the point he's trying to seek for
[1:06:27] something from the Lord he's a prophet
[1:06:29] looking for a vision he's looking for a
[1:06:31] word of the Lord he says so we get in
[1:06:35] there and they got in there L began to
[1:06:37] play maybe only to leave or something on
[1:06:39] that order of course they didn't have
[1:06:40] that song then but something on that
[1:06:42] order and this prophet I can see him
[1:06:44] sitting there start humming and patting
[1:06:46] his foot after a while he says what did
[1:06:48] he's getting in the spirit that's what
[1:06:50] the matter with the church tonight
[1:06:51] that's what's the matter with this
[1:06:53] meeting tonight if you can't get in the
[1:06:55] spirit you don't see nothing Elijah
[1:06:59] couldn't see something till he got in
[1:07:01] the spirit of it he said you have to get
[1:07:04] into the spirit of it before you can see
[1:07:05] it and that's where we need to be now we
[1:07:10] can never get to the place where we can
[1:07:14] step into this vision God has for us
[1:07:16] until we get in the spirit of the vision
[1:07:19] just like John on the Isle of Patmos he
[1:07:21] said I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:07:23] Day and what is it it just is so simple
[1:07:28] it's just an entering in you know I
[1:07:31] didn't bring it all I probably should
[1:07:33] have gotten it all out of there but
[1:07:34] there's so much that we put up a reading
[1:07:36] for a long time but brother Branham
[1:07:38] basically talks about how we spoke in
[1:07:40] the beginning of how the world so easily
[1:07:41] jumps into the spirit of things you go
[1:07:43] go to a baseball game someone hits a
[1:07:45] homerun everybody just gets up on their
[1:07:47] feet what they're getting into the
[1:07:49] spirit they don't even know it but what
[1:07:51] is it there what have they done they
[1:07:53] immerse themselves into that atmosphere
[1:07:56] that's what they did they took
[1:07:58] themselves from where they were at home
[1:08:01] and they put themselves into an
[1:08:03] atmosphere a baseball game whatever it
[1:08:05] might be and they what do they do they
[1:08:07] immerse themselves in it and they become
[1:08:10] part of it and so as it has to be with
[1:08:14] the people of God if you want to see God
[1:08:18] work in your life
[1:08:19] immerse yourself in that atmosphere
[1:08:22] take yourself out of your own atmosphere
[1:08:26] get yourself in there's atmosphere how
[1:08:29] do you do that you listen you listen to
[1:08:31] the message you sing to yourself in
[1:08:34] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:08:35] these are things that we we failed to do
[1:08:38] every day maybe as much as we ought to
[1:08:40] but so simple a fool could not err
[1:08:44] therein
[1:08:44] why because when the Spirit of God that
[1:08:48] atmosphere is there then you can hear
[1:08:50] him not only can you hear but you can
[1:08:53] discern it properly to know when it's
[1:08:56] the Spirit of God versus just your own
[1:08:57] reasoning it's something you can't
[1:09:00] explain it
[1:09:01] you can't brother rid of all we said you
[1:09:04] cannot explain the supernatural you just
[1:09:07] can't do it we've spent so much trying
[1:09:09] trying but you can't educate yourself
[1:09:13] into this you cannot do it I don't care
[1:09:17] how many Bible studies you have I don't
[1:09:18] care how much you memorize it you cannot
[1:09:21] educate yourself into it I thought about
[1:09:23] this I'm just going to say that I wasn't
[1:09:25] going to necessarily go this this
[1:09:26] direction but I thought about this
[1:09:28] Scripture it never struck me this way
[1:09:30] until this Sunday and where they're
[1:09:33] talking about and then I was listening
[1:09:35] to this message the one that we caught
[1:09:38] her in the beginning there the five had
[1:09:39] definite identifications and something
[1:09:42] struck me I never thought before because
[1:09:43] brother Branham and that message is
[1:09:44] talking about that education he said
[1:09:46] they've tried to educate people and do
[1:09:48] this and try to educate people into it I
[1:09:50] thought about I said you know the
[1:09:52] scripture said even before the day of
[1:09:54] Pentecost I believe it was that he
[1:09:57] opened their understanding to the
[1:09:59] scripture I thought I never thought
[1:10:01] about that before they could understand
[1:10:04] more the scripture and they had even
[1:10:06] gone to Pentecost yet you can't educate
[1:10:08] yourself into it why because even Cain
[1:10:11] in the Garden of Eden God explained it
[1:10:15] to him face-to-face what the word was
[1:10:17] and he could not live it why because
[1:10:21] it's got to be a supernatural life in
[1:10:23] you to live it out it has to be did not
[1:10:27] he come down remember by their fruits
[1:10:30] you shall know them
[1:10:33] Abell prevent presented sacrifice it
[1:10:38] looks crazy we look crazy giving
[1:10:42] sacrifices of praise sacrificing our own
[1:10:45] rights in the day of people's rights
[1:10:48] when everybody wants their rights I got
[1:10:51] a right to this and I got a right to
[1:10:53] that and I want this and I want that
[1:10:55] it's it's the unholy trinity me myself
[1:10:58] and I only want a fist and I want that
[1:11:03] what does that not cane I want to do it
[1:11:07] my way
[1:11:08] god I think I mean I've pondered this so
[1:11:11] much and it just absolutely amazes me
[1:11:13] God could come down the cane face the
[1:11:18] face and say if you didn't even it
[1:11:21] didn't even make it a mystery no mystery
[1:11:25] you see what your brother did just do
[1:11:29] that go get you lamb and kill it no
[1:11:36] mystery and he couldn't do it oh my
[1:11:46] why because he said either to serve God
[1:11:48] the way I want to serve God
[1:11:49] isn't that the world today I'm a
[1:11:52] Christian I can do whatever I want a
[1:11:57] Christian a true Christian does whatever
[1:12:01] he wants or she wants because what they
[1:12:04] want is what he was we've gotten past so
[1:12:10] many times the simplicity the gospel
[1:12:13] that's why as I said you know God puts
[1:12:16] it on your heart to do something it's in
[1:12:19] the word go into all the world preach
[1:12:21] the gospel demonstrate the power of God
[1:12:24] God says pray for this person or just
[1:12:26] witness to him or say something and say
[1:12:29] well surely Lord that couldn't be you do
[1:12:30] you think the devil's telling you to
[1:12:31] witness the people really I mean now we
[1:12:39] can't take it all the way to the other
[1:12:40] side there may be circumstances where
[1:12:44] God has to rein you back from a certain
[1:12:46] thing just because you're always at the
[1:12:49] right doesn't mean it's the season for
[1:12:50] it you know Jesus knew exactly who Judas
[1:12:53] was and he let him continue so we never
[1:12:57] want to take it to one side of the other
[1:12:59] but but sometimes I hate to say it we
[1:13:02] become subtle reasoning that were
[1:13:05] without reason even the Lord said come
[1:13:08] let us reason together
[1:13:10] what do we we passed aside our own
[1:13:12] reasoning to take his reason so I just
[1:13:18] think though somebody tie it's so simple
[1:13:20] though and it's the power of God to be
[1:13:24] demonstrated in your life but look how
[1:13:27] easy it is to get outside of that take
[1:13:30] the Pharisees and the Sadducees looking
[1:13:33] for a messiah new he's coming at least
[1:13:37] from the outside look like they wanted
[1:13:38] it but what happened they weren't in the
[1:13:41] vision they couldn't see like God saw so
[1:13:47] when God said John the Baptist looked
[1:13:51] like a crazy man to them why because
[1:13:53] they couldn't get in the spirit of that
[1:13:55] vision what if they were in the spear
[1:13:58] every said you can't see any
[1:14:00] thing until you get in the spirit
[1:14:02] because only the Spirit of God can
[1:14:04] reveal it to you that's he's the only
[1:14:09] one that can do it
[1:14:10] he's always God we can't do this on our
[1:14:15] own we can't hope to think ourselves
[1:14:17] think our way out of it these people in
[1:14:21] the world took all the toilet paper and
[1:14:25] it like two days I say that just as a
[1:14:29] demonstration they're insane
[1:14:32] they're insane now the toilet paper is
[1:14:37] all back uh you know they're the world
[1:14:45] is insane
[1:14:46] we can't you know I talked to my wife
[1:14:48] all the time and we discuss things you
[1:14:50] know always discussing there what's
[1:14:51] happened in the world you know the Lord
[1:14:53] no I believe we're not ignorant to
[1:14:55] what's happening many times maybe we
[1:14:58] know more than we are don't know we
[1:14:59] should leave that to them I think more
[1:15:01] often than we do but we're not ignorant
[1:15:03] to see what's happening where we're
[1:15:04] living and we're it's just it's the
[1:15:06] world that we live in we see it there's
[1:15:08] so many times we had this discussion I
[1:15:09] say you know what I just usually end the
[1:15:11] discussion with you you can't figure
[1:15:13] them out except to say they're anointed
[1:15:18] to do what they're doing because a
[1:15:20] rational reasonable sane person would
[1:15:23] not do what they're doing it's just it's
[1:15:26] just the reality of the situation but
[1:15:29] we've so many times we try that we try
[1:15:31] to figure these things out mentally and
[1:15:32] we'll run ourselves in circles but you
[1:15:33] can't do that you can't the spiritual
[1:15:36] things are M nity they say the carnal
[1:15:39] things are eminently with the spiritual
[1:15:40] things they it says you can't even cut
[1:15:43] they can't even comprehend the spiritual
[1:15:46] things but think about it the Pharisees
[1:15:49] and the Sadducees they had their vision
[1:15:52] they had their vision of what the
[1:15:54] Messiah was going to be no doubt rolled
[1:15:56] out the red carpet from heaven armies of
[1:15:59] angels at both sides walking down I am
[1:16:03] the great Messiah Rome's going down I'm
[1:16:07] gonna take Rome out why because
[1:16:09] everybody kind of thought that didn't
[1:16:10] they will this time restore the kingdom
[1:16:13] you know because they were thinking
[1:16:15] carnally but he came completely the
[1:16:18] opposite
[1:16:19] not realizing all the things that were
[1:16:22] being fulfilled born in a manger a
[1:16:24] little baby baby jehovah and then they
[1:16:28] flee down to egypt why just so a
[1:16:30] scripture could be fulfilled I've called
[1:16:32] my son out of Egypt not knowing he's in
[1:16:36] the vision but they had their own vision
[1:16:38] over here and see that's where we're
[1:16:40] living now we have the world has their
[1:16:44] vision and they are living it then
[1:16:47] what's our vision where are we if
[1:16:51] they're living their vision so
[1:16:54] effectively because why because we see
[1:16:58] it in the word what they were doing
[1:17:00] they're doing it as it was in the days
[1:17:03] of life as it was in the days of Noah
[1:17:06] they are living their side of the beach
[1:17:09] if that's the case where are we because
[1:17:15] while I was going on there was a knee
[1:17:17] knock that was going up there there was
[1:17:22] an old building an ark there was an
[1:17:26] angel that came down to Abraham and
[1:17:29] Sarah so if they're living theirs what
[1:17:35] are we doing with ours we've got to step
[1:17:39] into that vision and the only way we can
[1:17:42] do it see it is to get in the spirit of
[1:17:44] it and then find our positions and I'm
[1:17:49] gonna get to that in a minute but let's
[1:17:50] just do another one so we just mentioned
[1:17:54] this but the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[1:17:55] for John the Baptist they had their idea
[1:17:58] we know that Elijah must first come
[1:18:01] where is he he already came went right
[1:18:04] by him didn't even see it why because
[1:18:06] they weren't in that vision why
[1:18:12] shouldn't a lot it shouldn't Elias first
[1:18:14] God he already did and weren't some of
[1:18:19] them even in that ministry didn't even
[1:18:22] maybe know what they were doing do you
[1:18:25] think it could have been like that in
[1:18:26] our days
[1:18:27] you there was a pool there they didn't
[1:18:29] understand it but there was something
[1:18:31] there in those people that followed the
[1:18:34] Prophet around and knew that there was
[1:18:36] something to it couldn't maybe put their
[1:18:38] finger on it cuz the season hadn't come
[1:18:39] yet but there was something there but
[1:18:43] they they all had their ideas of what
[1:18:45] Elias would be and he came totally
[1:18:48] contrary brother Branham where's Malachi
[1:18:53] 4:5 where's where's that he came you
[1:18:58] didn't even know God took a poor
[1:19:02] Kentucky preach the gospel of the world
[1:19:06] use him in a mighty way that hadn't been
[1:19:09] seen since the time of Jesus Christ and
[1:19:11] the world now wouldn't even know who he
[1:19:14] was no idea why because they're not in
[1:19:18] the vision they can't they can't step
[1:19:20] into that vision they're living their
[1:19:21] vision and the people of God as we get
[1:19:24] up towards the the top of that pyramid
[1:19:26] it's getting smaller and smaller and
[1:19:28] smaller and smaller but here we are this
[1:19:31] little group who can see something on
[1:19:34] the horizon we can see was it the little
[1:19:40] wash woman had the had the rancher son
[1:19:41] come down
[1:19:43] she had a promise the rest of them
[1:19:45] didn't have said I'm coming back for you
[1:19:49] they didn't know anything about that
[1:19:51] promise oh she could tell it to them but
[1:19:55] she's the only one that experienced
[1:19:58] she's the only one that heard the love
[1:20:00] whispers oh I love you I see a character
[1:20:04] in you I didn't seen anybody else oh I
[1:20:07] see I see if I could say a seed in you
[1:20:10] that was placed there before the
[1:20:11] foundation of the world and I've
[1:20:14] quickened that seed before he could
[1:20:16] leave he had to quicken that seed seed
[1:20:18] was quickened and it just started to
[1:20:20] bubble up and grow and she started
[1:20:22] making herself ready she couldn't help
[1:20:24] it why because she had a vision she was
[1:20:28] stepping into the vision she was making
[1:20:31] herself ready she was making her
[1:20:33] preparations she was should we just say
[1:20:36] you know as brother Branham would say
[1:20:38] you know reading her Bible praying
[1:20:40] every day listening to the message
[1:20:42] getting into that atmosphere where where
[1:20:45] those things could prepare her for the
[1:20:48] day that he would come so then when when
[1:20:51] he came and she could see the dust on
[1:20:54] the horizon she said it was time she
[1:20:56] could get ready and just leave all those
[1:20:59] girls in the dust and that's what we're
[1:21:02] going to do but the only way we can do
[1:21:04] that is to get into their vision it's to
[1:21:07] get into that spirit that says he's
[1:21:09] coming I know I've got a promise just
[1:21:13] like Abraham I don't know how he's going
[1:21:15] to do it
[1:21:15] I really don't cater how he does it I
[1:21:19] just know he will because he is faithful
[1:21:22] their promise we get caught up in that
[1:21:26] we get caught up in the house we get
[1:21:29] caught up in the why we get caught up in
[1:21:31] the room well the who is me I don't know
[1:21:34] about you I'm believing for you but I
[1:21:37] can't know you you know you I know me
[1:21:42] amen we seek out our own salvation with
[1:21:46] fear and trembling
[1:21:47] I'll speak blessings upon the people of
[1:21:51] God and say every one of us I believe
[1:21:53] we're gonna be there I will be that way
[1:21:56] but I can't know it I can only know for
[1:21:59] me so that's the who we don't have to
[1:22:01] worry about the who why because he said
[1:22:06] so
[1:22:07] that's good enough for me and I'm gonna
[1:22:10] cut the line there because if you dig
[1:22:12] down that line or why me oh how could he
[1:22:15] with me I've done this and I've done
[1:22:17] that yeah you're gonna get you weave
[1:22:19] yourself right out of it
[1:22:20] why because he said so
[1:22:23] from the foundation of the world he saw
[1:22:26] and planted something in you that he
[1:22:31] knew would believe this were that was
[1:22:34] this word that would be flesh of his
[1:22:36] flesh bone of his bone spirit of the
[1:22:38] spirit life of his life and he put that
[1:22:41] in there so you don't have to worry
[1:22:43] about the why how that doesn't matter at
[1:22:47] all why because he promised it when when
[1:22:52] God gave a promise to Abraham he didn't
[1:22:55] know how it was gonna happen how do we
[1:22:58] know he didn't know how because he tried
[1:22:59] about everything else he tried with
[1:23:03] Hagar he lied about you know Sarah being
[1:23:06] his wife all these different things were
[1:23:07] happening back and forth but I like it
[1:23:09] because the divine commentary Hebrews
[1:23:11] said he staggered out the promise so you
[1:23:14] can so you can live for God you can live
[1:23:19] for Jesus Christ with freedom knowing
[1:23:21] there's something in you because you
[1:23:23] don't know Alan how many times you fall
[1:23:26] in stumble I don't know about you but
[1:23:29] you know I struggle sometimes I've gone
[1:23:32] through severe depressions for years
[1:23:34] where I was just convinced that at least
[1:23:39] in my mind I was convinced there's no
[1:23:41] way I can I can make this I'm just I
[1:23:43] gotta be serpent seed there's no way I'm
[1:23:45] just being honest I am I'm not gonna put
[1:23:49] on any airs of anything because I'm a
[1:23:51] man uh-uh there's nothing you know that
[1:23:53] Jesus Christ has it saved me from and
[1:23:55] delivered me from that I you know what I
[1:23:57] have no shame in that sense because he
[1:23:59] saved me
[1:24:00] he's the one that's worthy if you look
[1:24:03] at this flesh you're gonna be
[1:24:03] disappointed dig deep enough and you'll
[1:24:06] always find something about yourself or
[1:24:07] someone else it's easy to criticize
[1:24:11] don't we live in a critical world it
[1:24:14] doesn't matter you could you could be a
[1:24:16] multi-billionaire
[1:24:17] and give it all the way to charity but
[1:24:20] you offended someone thirty years ago
[1:24:22] and you are dirt that's just in the
[1:24:25] natural and we do the same in the
[1:24:27] spiritual forgiveness we need
[1:24:31] forgiveness if we can't forgive one
[1:24:33] another how if you can't forgive your
[1:24:36] brother how are you going to love those
[1:24:40] out there if you can't look at the one
[1:24:43] sitting beside you I'm a frontline
[1:24:45] fighting with you and love them and
[1:24:48] forgive them then how are you gonna have
[1:24:51] love for the ones that are stoning you
[1:24:54] to death or that are out there chasing
[1:24:56] you down trying to kill you because it's
[1:24:57] coming there's got to be a love there
[1:25:02] there's got to be a defined love with
[1:25:05] forgiveness in our hearts amen yeah but
[1:25:12] the vision has got to be made plain to
[1:25:15] you but there's you know no matter how
[1:25:18] many times I've gotten down I it's
[1:25:21] supernatural there is something in my
[1:25:23] heart that always comes back and just
[1:25:24] says Lord I don't know anything else but
[1:25:27] to believe this ah it's like our brother
[1:25:30] our brother brother David our pastor
[1:25:33] preach on Sunday speak and go forward I
[1:25:36] don't know anything else but that
[1:25:40] there's nowhere else to go you'll give
[1:25:43] me a revelation
[1:25:45] that's perfect is what we have now with
[1:25:47] this message there anyone out there I
[1:25:50] mean if there is the Lord will give it
[1:25:53] to me because I believe it would be for
[1:25:54] me but there anyone out there but
[1:25:58] there's something in you that just can't
[1:25:59] help but just to continue going forward
[1:26:02] I mean no doubt over 25 years
[1:26:05] Abraham looking at Ishmael and knowing
[1:26:09] thinking about what happened there and
[1:26:11] all the things that transpired no doubt
[1:26:13] the devil was right there to accuse him
[1:26:15] no doubt he had his struggles you claim
[1:26:19] to believe the promise of God who you've
[1:26:21] never seen you're searching for a city
[1:26:24] whose supposed builder and maker is God
[1:26:26] you ain't seen no city and just live in
[1:26:28] a tent
[1:26:30] that's the truth he was seeking a
[1:26:34] supernatural City
[1:26:36] he didn't even maybe nobody was looking
[1:26:39] for but there was a pull in him that
[1:26:42] could not be stopped and there was
[1:26:47] something in each and every one of you I
[1:26:48] believe this evening that cannot be
[1:26:52] stopped why because God put it there and
[1:26:55] if he put it there he'll bring it to
[1:26:58] pass God you didn't put me in you can't
[1:27:04] put me out I didn't even put myself in
[1:27:07] Samara how hard the devil tries to get
[1:27:09] me to do it I can't put myself out so
[1:27:16] you might as well just surrender to the
[1:27:18] vision surrender to the things that God
[1:27:21] spoken of you in the word and just go
[1:27:24] forward Moses did the same thing they
[1:27:28] not description said he knew I mean
[1:27:32] we've heard brother Branham talk about
[1:27:33] it Moses knew he was meant to be a
[1:27:35] deliverer he was raised right he was
[1:27:39] taught spent 40 years learning all the
[1:27:42] ways of the Egyptians and no doubt and
[1:27:44] his natural mind because we know he
[1:27:46] failed so it had to be natural he was
[1:27:48] thinking the whole time he's sitting in
[1:27:49] military tactics class I'm gonna follow
[1:27:52] that one away that's gonna be great when
[1:27:55] I get the children of Israel all
[1:27:56] together we're gonna take these guys out
[1:27:57] why because he was naturally thinking
[1:28:00] and we know it because he slew the
[1:28:02] Egyptian and then he ran him why because
[1:28:06] he wasn't yet in the vision he could he
[1:28:09] could see it
[1:28:10] he knew that just right now I believe we
[1:28:15] know we know that there's a rapture we
[1:28:20] know that the power of God is real we've
[1:28:24] seen it I believe we've seen just little
[1:28:26] glimpses but we know it's real you can't
[1:28:29] take that devil can't take that away
[1:28:30] from you I was here when I heard brother
[1:28:34] Matt's testimony about that that bladder
[1:28:36] being healed not only that he
[1:28:40] experienced it you think the devil
[1:28:43] Devils going to absolutely try to take
[1:28:44] that away from him you don't think the
[1:28:46] Devils probably been on him say no that
[1:28:49] wasn't what the doctor thought it was
[1:28:50] you know this and that what he's always
[1:28:53] there to disparate this the work about
[1:28:56] you can you can bank on that one he's
[1:29:00] gonna be there but all we can do if say
[1:29:04] Lord you're the one that did it I don't
[1:29:08] know how it happened but Here I am
[1:29:10] we've seen too much one brother Brahim
[1:29:14] they say all God doesn't heal gods in
[1:29:16] view this a brother and say you're too
[1:29:17] late for that man I've seen way too much
[1:29:20] I've seen God in my life I look back
[1:29:24] Flint for years knew the message was
[1:29:27] right but God had seasons for everything
[1:29:30] you know and I thank the Lord for it you
[1:29:33] know what because there's one day I was
[1:29:35] sitting maybe one day I'll tell the
[1:29:36] whole testimony but I one day I was
[1:29:38] sitting in Denver at my computer because
[1:29:40] I just kind of felt stirred and
[1:29:42] something in me hadn't gone to church in
[1:29:45] like two years
[1:29:46] and just was depressed if I had had any
[1:29:50] courage I probably would kill myself but
[1:29:52] I knew too much about God and I was too
[1:29:54] scared to do that so I just kind of
[1:29:56] huddled to myself it didn't do anything
[1:29:57] to talk to anybody for years and one day
[1:30:01] I up I was on Facebook because I only I
[1:30:04] made a fake Facebook because I didn't
[1:30:07] want anybody to know that I was trying
[1:30:10] to see what my friends were doing and I
[1:30:13] didn't I was too ashamed to let them
[1:30:14] know that I was kind of spying on him
[1:30:16] and seeing how everybody was doing
[1:30:18] because I was felt on the outside
[1:30:19] looking in I'm just being real we're
[1:30:22] humans were flesh-and-blood now I'm
[1:30:24] gonna expose the devil every chance I
[1:30:26] get
[1:30:26] because I'm tired of the devil hiding
[1:30:29] behind pride does the scripture not say
[1:30:32] to confess your faults one to another
[1:30:33] and pray one for another that's what we
[1:30:35] ought to be doing we ought to be
[1:30:36] exposing that death but anyway and I
[1:30:41] happened to read something for brother
[1:30:42] Simon Smith and he just it was just a
[1:30:44] simple little Facebook post and he
[1:30:45] doesn't even really use Facebook
[1:30:47] hardly and he just her a little Facebook
[1:30:49] post because they had some meetings or
[1:30:51] some revival meetings he said man those
[1:30:52] were the most powerful meetings I had
[1:30:54] ever been to just a little post and
[1:30:55] stuff that struck me
[1:30:57] because that's like I can't I came in
[1:30:58] the message around the Lord revealed
[1:31:00] this message to me right around the same
[1:31:01] time as him knowing him for years
[1:31:03] really good friends like me I've been in
[1:31:05] a lot of meetings with that guy those
[1:31:08] were the best he's ever been in man what
[1:31:09] was I missing haha and something spoke
[1:31:12] to my heart and it was God because it
[1:31:15] couldn't have anything else because at
[1:31:17] that time I wasn't even trying to help
[1:31:19] myself
[1:31:19] I was probably totally insane because
[1:31:23] like brother branham said I've seen man
[1:31:24] would tried to help himself but I was
[1:31:27] just wallowing in my own misery and
[1:31:29] something spoke to my harness it and
[1:31:31] you're gonna miss a rapture for this and
[1:31:34] this being just kind of this stuff that
[1:31:38] you're upset about or whatever it was
[1:31:40] and at that moment God turned my whole
[1:31:44] life around yeah it was it was as if I'd
[1:31:47] seen Jesus Christ for the first time
[1:31:50] again I can't explain it I just know
[1:31:54] he's faithful and if you're on that spot
[1:31:57] right now you know I can't you can't
[1:32:00] explain the supernatural but all I know
[1:32:02] is this is if God's put that little
[1:32:05] thing in your heart that for some reason
[1:32:07] just can't stop that just can't keep
[1:32:10] going like no matter what happens you
[1:32:11] just Lord I just I know not only is this
[1:32:15] message real but you did not bring me to
[1:32:19] this world just to leave me you didn't
[1:32:23] reveal to me something that 99% of the
[1:32:28] world knows nothing about just to cast
[1:32:31] me aside you didn't promise me a bread
[1:32:34] promised me bread just to give me a
[1:32:37] stone you didn't promise me my family
[1:32:41] just to let it rot
[1:32:44] you didn't promise me my healing just to
[1:32:48] let me suffer you may suffer for a
[1:32:52] season but joy comes in the morning we
[1:32:56] do all these things that were going
[1:32:58] through they're just light afflictions
[1:33:00] but he's able he's faithful the
[1:33:04] scripture said about Sarah it says Sarah
[1:33:07] judged him faithful that promised have
[1:33:10] you judged him faithful he is faithful
[1:33:14] bukka revelation says he is faithful his
[1:33:17] name is faithful and true amen
[1:33:21] everything he has said he will do amen
[1:33:27] we got to get into the spirit of the
[1:33:29] vision and not and that not only that
[1:33:32] but when we see it we need to grab it
[1:33:35] and we need to walk towards it I
[1:33:38] couldn't find the quote but I know I've
[1:33:40] heard it and I'm paraphrasing but you if
[1:33:42] I'm wrong brother David will correct me
[1:33:44] because he's the pastor he'll know I
[1:33:46] believe the Spirit of Lord would reveal
[1:33:47] it to him but I've heard this before and
[1:33:50] I'm 99.9 percent but we talk about
[1:33:52] brother Branham says we would there's a
[1:33:55] there's a well person out in front of
[1:33:56] him and what do you do you just start
[1:33:59] walking one step at a time towards that
[1:34:01] vision of that well person that applies
[1:34:05] to all those all those things do you
[1:34:10] need delivered from something God's got
[1:34:12] that vision for you of a free child of
[1:34:17] God free from that bondage what do you
[1:34:20] do you just start walking towards that
[1:34:21] vision you say devil's gonna knock you
[1:34:24] down you just get back up and keep going
[1:34:26] because time we live in time time is are
[1:34:31] one of our biggest enemies and the
[1:34:34] promises of God are all there they're
[1:34:36] perfect they're true they are immutable
[1:34:38] they can't be stopped
[1:34:40] and yet time it's almost like a wave on
[1:34:43] the ocean it's just constantly beating
[1:34:44] away time just beating away trying to a
[1:34:47] road what's it trying to do is trying to
[1:34:48] erode your faith just over and over
[1:34:51] again it's just constantly beating but
[1:34:52] if we can get out of time and just get
[1:34:56] into the
[1:34:56] spirit get into the spirit of that
[1:35:00] vision so we can see what God sees about
[1:35:02] you see that delivered family member
[1:35:06] that you've been struggling so much and
[1:35:07] praying like crying tears Dayton Derrick
[1:35:10] day and night for I got him out there we
[1:35:14] I believe a lot of us most of us
[1:35:16] probably got him out there or something
[1:35:19] the death would have been trying to eat
[1:35:21] you been struggling with for years and
[1:35:23] you just can't seem to get over that
[1:35:25] hurdle you just keep walking to you God
[1:35:28] has got a vision for you of a freed
[1:35:30] individual why because God doesn't do a
[1:35:34] halfway work Jesus Christ doesn't do
[1:35:37] things halfway he did it all on Calvary
[1:35:41] and we really see it bit by bit
[1:35:45] little by little why because you're
[1:35:47] gonna take the land a little bit at a
[1:35:48] time a little bit at a time a little bit
[1:35:50] at a time and so many times we see that
[1:35:53] big thing over there and say man I gotta
[1:35:54] go get that and then the Lord says no
[1:35:57] you got to go kill this little one first
[1:36:01] I'm just this just the way it's the way
[1:36:04] it is those those natural things were
[1:36:05] given for our spiritual edification to
[1:36:07] understand that things do it's not just
[1:36:10] it's not a microwave thing it's not a
[1:36:13] snap crackle pop we're all done the Lord
[1:36:15] is working on each one of us in
[1:36:17] different ways and here's the thing but
[1:36:23] we have to trust what he's saying about
[1:36:26] us as this thought it's thought this I
[1:36:29] you can turn with me if you want but in
[1:36:31] judges chapter 6 God has a vision for
[1:36:35] you and then we'll close with this
[1:36:39] judges chapter 6 we know the story here
[1:36:42] in verse 11 it says this and there came
[1:36:50] an angel of the Lord and sat under an
[1:36:52] oak which was in Oprah that pertained
[1:36:55] unto joash the Ibiza right and his son
[1:36:58] gideon thresh sweet by the winepress to
[1:37:01] hide it from the Midianites and the
[1:37:03] angel of the Lord appeared unto him and
[1:37:04] sent it to him the Lord be with the Lord
[1:37:07] is with thee thou mighty man of Valor
[1:37:08] and
[1:37:10] and said unto him o my lord hath the war
[1:37:12] be with us then why is all this befallen
[1:37:14] us
[1:37:14] and where be all his miracles which our
[1:37:18] fathers told us of saying did not the
[1:37:20] Lord bring us from Egypt but now the
[1:37:22] Lord has forsaken us and delivered us
[1:37:24] into the hands of the Midianites and the
[1:37:26] Lord looked upon him and said go in this
[1:37:29] thy might and thou shalt save Israel
[1:37:32] from the hand of the Midianites have I
[1:37:33] have not i sent thee and he said it to
[1:37:36] him this is so what are we looking at
[1:37:38] here the Lord is giving a vision he's
[1:37:41] expressing God's vision to Gideon you're
[1:37:44] a mighty man of Valor that's what he's
[1:37:47] saying to the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:37:49] she's a mighty bride of Valor you're a
[1:37:53] mighty son or daughter of God but what
[1:37:57] do we do this is exactly what we come
[1:37:59] back with through many times isn't it
[1:38:00] because we're looking at ourselves he
[1:38:01] said unto Him o my Lord what was shy
[1:38:04] save Israel behold my family is poor in
[1:38:07] Manasseh and I am the least in my
[1:38:09] father's house oh my not even knowing
[1:38:12] that God would take another one that
[1:38:14] looked least in his father's house by
[1:38:16] the name of David and anoint him king
[1:38:18] over his reel amen but what did the Lord
[1:38:21] said unto Him surely I will be with thee
[1:38:23] and thou shalt smite the Midianites is
[1:38:26] one man and he said unto him if now I
[1:38:29] have found grace in thy sight then show
[1:38:30] me a sign that thou talkest with me and
[1:38:32] we know the story from there we have to
[1:38:36] believe what God said about us speak and
[1:38:42] go forward why because we have a vision
[1:38:46] laid out we had a prophet come that's
[1:38:51] why we spoke that's why we read the
[1:38:53] scripture at Habakkuk he said make the
[1:38:57] vision plain and write it upon tables so
[1:39:01] him that readeth me run I believe we've
[1:39:04] had a vision made plain in our day we
[1:39:06] have a message that lays out who we are
[1:39:10] all we got to do is walk towards it
[1:39:15] this may sound really kind of silly but
[1:39:17] I believe it was the Lord that quickened
[1:39:19] it to me I was thinking about that
[1:39:21] scripture and it says it says make the
[1:39:24] vision plain and write it upon tables so
[1:39:26] that he that readeth may run
[1:39:28] I thought braided upon tables and I
[1:39:30] looked at my phone I had a little app
[1:39:32] there that said the table it's been
[1:39:36] written upon the tables it's there the
[1:39:40] visions been made plain it's right there
[1:39:43] and what is it saying it since you're a
[1:39:44] mighty man of Valor
[1:39:45] it says you you're a bride with that
[1:39:48] spot or wrinkle what but you've got to
[1:39:51] look get in the spirit of that vision
[1:39:53] and just keep walking towards it
[1:39:57] we've got to trust what God said about
[1:40:00] us and then speak the word and go
[1:40:03] forward it took Moses 80 years to get to
[1:40:08] that point and even then even after all
[1:40:12] that he still struggled so why would we
[1:40:16] be any different in the in the carnal
[1:40:19] sense but what was it he God was showing
[1:40:22] us that no matter what there's that way
[1:40:24] through if we would just trust in the
[1:40:27] word that he was spoken already it'll
[1:40:30] work the gospel the power of God
[1:40:33] demonstrated we can't be afraid any more
[1:40:38] we can't be afraid to step out on a limb
[1:40:41] I'm gonna read this last quote and this
[1:40:42] is this will be it right here
[1:40:45] he says this is from Abraham's seed 1959
[1:40:49] notice Abraham he was just an ordinary
[1:40:51] man come down from the Tower of Babel
[1:40:53] with his father and they settled down in
[1:40:55] the woods up in the land of Shinar come
[1:40:57] down into the city of Ur in the land of
[1:40:59] the Chaldeans he was just an ordinary
[1:41:00] man no not nothing not no saint no God
[1:41:04] he's just an ordinary man nothing about
[1:41:07] him any different from anyone else no
[1:41:09] more than there is you just an ordinary
[1:41:11] person but God saw something in him and
[1:41:13] he called him how many of you been
[1:41:16] called we're here aren't we
[1:41:19] ah the world thinks you're crazy already
[1:41:22] we might as well go all in with it make
[1:41:26] make him write and believe this word so
[1:41:28] much today really do think we're crazy
[1:41:31] he said but God saw something in him and
[1:41:35] he called him God seen the same thing in
[1:41:38] every born again man and woman here now
[1:41:40] Abraham wasn't afraid to put his to work
[1:41:43] are you the same faith that he gave
[1:41:47] Abraham he gives it to you freely if
[1:41:50] you'll use it say I have a gun it'll
[1:41:54] shoot it's a good true shooting gun I
[1:41:56] hang it up on the wall
[1:41:58] I say yeah oh sure I got a gun isn't
[1:42:00] that what brother David was basically
[1:42:02] preaching this Sunday we you got the
[1:42:05] Spirit of God in you we have the Holy
[1:42:08] Ghost
[1:42:09] that's quickened you from a dead life
[1:42:12] unto life in Jesus Christ we have a word
[1:42:15] that's promised but then we just put it
[1:42:18] up on the wall so what you do it okay
[1:42:21] said say have a gun it'll shoot it's a
[1:42:23] good true shooting gun is this a good
[1:42:25] true shooting gun amen
[1:42:28] I hang it up on the wall I say yo sure I
[1:42:31] got a gun
[1:42:31] what'd you do with it it hangs on the
[1:42:33] wall that's faith people say oh I'm a
[1:42:36] Christian I believe God can but what do
[1:42:38] you do about it
[1:42:39] put it to work turn it loose do
[1:42:42] something with it
[1:42:43] I like this get out and hunt up the
[1:42:46] devil where he says you're you still
[1:42:48] hurt say you're a liar
[1:42:50] pull a bead on him get him in the scope
[1:42:53] don't be afraid to pull the trigger
[1:42:55] because it'll go off sure as anything
[1:42:57] yes sir
[1:42:59] it'll boomerang on him so hold on so
[1:43:02] that's what I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:43:03] pull up beat on the death when he's
[1:43:07] telling you all your faults you say
[1:43:09] thanks devil thank you Lord you just
[1:43:11] revealed I'm gonna pull a bead of faith
[1:43:13] right on and blast him out out of there
[1:43:16] with the word why because he's put it in
[1:43:19] you to do it you we must do it it's not
[1:43:24] by our own might why because you're me
[1:43:26] you may not always see the effects right
[1:43:28] away we're so we so we want things now
[1:43:31] now now now
[1:43:33] like children in that way but we should
[1:43:35] be more mature when it comes to being
[1:43:37] able to wait upon the Lord wait for that
[1:43:39] movement then we can step right into the
[1:43:41] vision I said that was the last thing
[1:43:44] but this is the very last thing only
[1:43:46] because this was kind of the crux of the
[1:43:48] whole idea and thank the Lord for
[1:43:50] bringing it back to my remembrance the
[1:43:52] crux of that whole idea was this I'm
[1:43:54] talking about stepping into the vision I
[1:43:55] don't even need this because we know the
[1:43:56] story brother Branham had a vision about
[1:43:59] a little boy that was supposed to be
[1:44:00] healed that he went and prayed for him
[1:44:02] and that he was healed and he got so
[1:44:05] stirred up about it he went right to the
[1:44:07] house knocked down the door and say
[1:44:09] brother you trust me
[1:44:10] bring the baby over here I'll pray for
[1:44:12] me he prayed for baby got worse and
[1:44:14] started crying and crying
[1:44:15] he said he passed out right there and he
[1:44:17] said the mom started crying
[1:44:19] oh I'm just dramatized so you understand
[1:44:23] it's not an easy situation did you
[1:44:26] imagine that the prophet saw the vision
[1:44:29] knew what God's will was to heal that
[1:44:32] child and then he goes in there pray for
[1:44:34] the baby and passes out I just try to
[1:44:37] put myself in that situation Lord I've
[1:44:40] seen a vision you're gonna heal the
[1:44:42] child in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:44:43] the child's healed by vision Davey
[1:44:47] passes out mom baby and all I'm trying
[1:44:51] to be funny because you imagine the
[1:44:52] chaos but what was the prophets talk
[1:44:55] immediately there was something wrong
[1:44:57] because he's seen the vision he may
[1:44:59] never fail there's something wrong and
[1:45:01] he realized this one brother wasn't
[1:45:03] where he's supposed to be this one thing
[1:45:05] wasn't where it was supposed to be why
[1:45:07] he didn't wait for the vision he didn't
[1:45:11] wait for everything just to get in the
[1:45:13] spot that it was supposed to be God's
[1:45:17] got a vision for us children of God but
[1:45:20] we've got to get into our spots
[1:45:22] the great if I could call it like this
[1:45:24] the great machinery of God can't turn
[1:45:26] properly until every cog is in the right
[1:45:30] spot and then you watch as soon as that
[1:45:33] last one clicks into place
[1:45:34] those wheels of prophecy will get to
[1:45:36] moving the Holy Ghost will start to burn
[1:45:38] him that engine will start firing up and
[1:45:40] we'll be out of here before they could
[1:45:41] say anything but what was it he had to
[1:45:45] wait till hours in silence he said if
[1:45:51] you read the stories I can imagine how
[1:45:53] awkward it was they're all crying pacing
[1:45:57] back and forth my baby my baby and
[1:45:59] here's the Prophet he sat in the corner
[1:46:01] and he and he basically said he didn't
[1:46:03] say anything for almost two hours
[1:46:04] he just sat there he said I want to say
[1:46:08] anything and he and he realized what it
[1:46:10] was the vision hadn't been put into
[1:46:13] place and he said Oh Lord forgive me
[1:46:15] Lord if you just give me another chance
[1:46:17] why I believe the Lord was teaching his
[1:46:19] prophet and by proxy he's teaching us so
[1:46:23] many times we get enthused like brother
[1:46:26] David he said go do that saw light in
[1:46:28] your heart the Prophet said what he had
[1:46:29] to come back and correct it why not
[1:46:31] because it was wrong
[1:46:32] it just wasn't the season David's heart
[1:46:36] was right we know that because I said he
[1:46:38] his heart was set upon the Lord his
[1:46:41] heart was after God so he sits there
[1:46:45] he's thinking oh Lord
[1:46:46] just give me another chance maybe Lord
[1:46:48] you'll have mercy two hours he sits
[1:46:50] there and then here comes some the lady
[1:46:54] the grandmother come up and she went
[1:46:57] through the back way any Caesar he says
[1:47:00] that's the lady that's the lady that was
[1:47:02] supposed to be here he says Oh God maybe
[1:47:04] you'll just give me another chance maybe
[1:47:06] you'll have mercy he has mercy brothers
[1:47:09] and sisters
[1:47:09] no matter how much you think you messed
[1:47:12] it up he's got mercy for you if there's
[1:47:16] just that little pull in your heart that
[1:47:17] you want to get right with God he's got
[1:47:19] mercy for you
[1:47:21] no matter how much you've messed up his
[1:47:24] vision for your life you'll just wait
[1:47:26] upon the Lord they that wait upon the
[1:47:28] Lord though the vision tarry wait for it
[1:47:33] you may not know what God's got for you
[1:47:35] in your life yet I don't believe any of
[1:47:38] us have completely made me figure it out
[1:47:40] what God's got for us on everything but
[1:47:43] there are certain things we know for
[1:47:44] sure preach the gospel to every creature
[1:47:46] go forth through all the word lay hands
[1:47:48] on the sick pray for the sick all these
[1:47:50] different things that are just laid out
[1:47:51] in the scripture for everybody but
[1:47:53] there's a vision guys got for you your
[1:47:55] life and you've got to seek that out for
[1:47:58] yourself and then when you find it get
[1:48:00] into that vision get into your place
[1:48:02] because we as a body cannot move forward
[1:48:06] until we're all in that spot why brother
[1:48:09] Branham had to wait until the one
[1:48:12] brother put his coat on to get ready to
[1:48:14] go to work he thought oh my if he leaves
[1:48:16] it's all over if he leaves it's all over
[1:48:18] he's get his coat on yeah and by then
[1:48:21] it's gonna be night time with his babies
[1:48:23] almost dead it's just in the morning and
[1:48:25] then he sees the old lady come up soon
[1:48:27] Lord maybe you'll give me another chance
[1:48:28] oh my she took her glasses off and they
[1:48:31] were fogged up and I could just you can
[1:48:34] read it you can feel the spirit of his
[1:48:36] excitement Lord you're given another
[1:48:38] chance
[1:48:39] he's giving us all another chance how
[1:48:40] many times have you done it before
[1:48:43] you'll do it again we've got to believe
[1:48:45] that I've messed up so many times
[1:48:49] Abraham messed up so many times but when
[1:48:51] the commentary was written he staggered
[1:48:53] not hey man thank the Lord for that His
[1:49:01] grace covers it
[1:49:04] yes Lord and he waits there then he's
[1:49:07] sitting on the thing and he was old yeah
[1:49:09] that's right in the fishing the brother
[1:49:10] had to be sitting right here so he gets
[1:49:12] up but he just kind of steps off to the
[1:49:14] side and I the way I was reading it
[1:49:16] there
[1:49:17] earlier I was reading and it just it
[1:49:19] sounds so awkward in the natural because
[1:49:21] the one brother says brother would you
[1:49:22] brother Brennan would you like to pray
[1:49:24] for the child again he just says thanks
[1:49:26] I can imagine what that kind of sound
[1:49:28] thanks oh okay you want to pray for him
[1:49:30] or not
[1:49:30] I'm think I'm putting myself in the
[1:49:32] vision trying to imagine what they would
[1:49:34] have felt they've been up all night it's
[1:49:36] the breaking a day he he says thanks and
[1:49:39] then he gets up in the brother sits down
[1:49:41] he says brother do you have confidence
[1:49:42] in me still he said sure I do brother
[1:49:44] branner he says he says bring the baby
[1:49:46] here he says Lord forgive your servant
[1:49:48] I'm a stupidity Oh
[1:49:50] brother branham was stupid what am i you
[1:49:54] know you know but God had mercy and he
[1:49:59] prayed and the baby was well he said
[1:50:01] look brother branham I'm perfectly whole
[1:50:03] that's that's what he's got for us we
[1:50:07] may mess things up we mess things up all
[1:50:09] the time but God's got mercy for you
[1:50:11] he's got grace to fill in the gap amen
[1:50:14] let's all stand
[1:50:23] the Lord has been so good to us you know
[1:50:27] I look at my own life and I'm ashamed of
[1:50:29] myself at how many times I doubt when
[1:50:32] I've seen I look back in my life and I
[1:50:33] actually think about it about what he's
[1:50:36] brought me through you know I believe
[1:50:39] each one of us could have that that that
[1:50:42] feeling the devil would try to put on
[1:50:43] you of all those things but he is
[1:50:45] faithful he's got a vision for this
[1:50:48] bride I know a part of it is onward
[1:50:51] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[1:50:53] just going up and up and up and up amen
[1:50:56] that's part of the vision I'm gonna walk
[1:50:58] in that vision I'm gonna do my best to
[1:51:00] get into the spirit of this word stay in
[1:51:04] that atmosphere get into that atmosphere
[1:51:07] every day and then you just watch the
[1:51:09] Lord work in your life watch the Lord
[1:51:12] work in your brothers and sisters lives
[1:51:14] amen amen let's just bow our heads
[1:51:17] Heavenly Father Lord we just love you
[1:51:19] and we're so grateful for your mercy and
[1:51:21] your grace O God Lord you're faithful
[1:51:25] Lord your mercies are renewed every
[1:51:27] morning Oh God Lord you said though a
[1:51:31] righteous man would stumble he gets back
[1:51:33] up Lord and is only by your grace that
[1:51:36] we can get back up but Lord when we get
[1:51:38] back up we know it's just that that life
[1:51:41] that you put in us that can't help but
[1:51:43] get up Lord Jesus because Lord you got
[1:51:47] up from a grave one day Lord so we have
[1:51:50] to get up from our own failures and
[1:51:52] shortcomings and we have to keep walking
[1:51:54] towards that vision you set before us
[1:51:55] Lord may you forgive us Lord of all of
[1:51:58] our mistakes Oh God Lord and may you
[1:52:01] just put in our hearts that vision Lord
[1:52:03] of a bride that's without spot or
[1:52:06] wrinkle Lord may we take that spirit of
[1:52:09] that vision Lord that you see not just
[1:52:11] apply it to ourselves but apply it to
[1:52:13] our brothers and sisters Lord put it on
[1:52:16] to our family Lord because we know that
[1:52:19] you're coming we see all the signs
[1:52:22] coming Lord Jesus were with our prophet
[1:52:26] could say he was and we were in the last
[1:52:27] days so many times ago and we see these
[1:52:29] things being fulfilled now Lord it's
[1:52:31] just even at the door lord I believe we
[1:52:34] are
[1:52:34] such a desperation lure helped us to
[1:52:36] have that desperation Lord Jesus Lord
[1:52:39] you're worthy of all praise Lord for you
[1:52:42] did it all we give glory to your name
[1:52:44] Lord Jesus Lord bind up the
[1:52:46] brokenhearted or heal the afflicted Lord
[1:52:49] Jesus Lord you did it all from before
[1:52:52] the foundation of the world the lamb was
[1:52:53] slain Lord and you've seen us all here
[1:52:56] Lord you predestinated your seed to this
[1:52:58] our Lord because you knew that the
[1:53:01] Spirit that's in your people would rise
[1:53:03] to the occasion Oh God because it's you
[1:53:05] and not us may we just find the grace of
[1:53:08] God to get ourselves out of the way in
[1:53:09] our everyday life Oh God to submit
[1:53:11] ourselves to your spirit Lord not to
[1:53:14] reason ourselves out of that you're
[1:53:15] working Lord but just just step into it
[1:53:17] more we accept it Lord we receive it now
[1:53:21] we believe it oh God
[1:53:23] and we'll walk forward Lord and we'll
[1:53:26] speak that word before us knowing that
[1:53:28] you can't fail we just thank you for it
[1:53:31] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
