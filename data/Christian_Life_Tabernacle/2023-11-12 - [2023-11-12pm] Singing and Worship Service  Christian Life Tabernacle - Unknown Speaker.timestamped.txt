[7:12] real bashful about putting somebody on
[7:14] the spot so but if that happens I just
[7:17] wanted to throw that out there to say it
[7:20] but uh it's just a opportunity you know
[7:24] uh through the year uh you know services
[7:27] and different times and we always can't
[7:30] get everybody in but uh you know if
[7:34] don't let this be the only time that you
[7:36] sing so you know always turn in your
[7:39] request if you have a song in your heart
[7:40] and if we can work it in throughout the
[7:43] year uh we
[7:45] certainly uh want to do that but this is
[7:48] always a wonderful time for me to just
[7:51] enjoy the singing and and the fellowship
[7:55] and just the love that we have for the
[7:58] Lord and to sing pray praises to him I
[8:01] mean he is um isn't he been good to
[8:04] us

[8:09] entered into our hearts or Minds the
[8:11] things that he has prepared for them
[8:14] that love them there's sometimes God's
[8:17] blessings are so rich I just can't think
[8:19] it gets any better you know you just
[8:22] want to scream you just want to be like
