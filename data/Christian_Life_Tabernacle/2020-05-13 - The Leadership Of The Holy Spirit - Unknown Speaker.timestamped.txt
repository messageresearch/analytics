[39:36] unravel me
[39:38] [Music]
[40:00] [Music]
[40:12] [Music]
[40:24] [Music]
[40:49] again

[41:09] [Music]
[41:24] [Music]
[41:30] amen Heavenly Father no longer a slave
[41:36] to fear perfect love cast out all fear
[41:44] [Music]
[41:46] how could one accept your love and still
[41:52] be bound when your love puts all our
[41:58] confidence and trust in you
[42:00] we ask you to bless us tonight father
[42:02] guide us help us a understanding be our
[42:07] portion dis evening we ask you to be
[42:10] with us tonight in Jesus precious name
[42:13] we pray amen amen you may be seated
[42:17] before we go and have a little time of
[42:23] fellowship in the word I'd like to go
[42:30] ahead and just make an announcement or
[42:37] two basically this weekend we're going
[42:45] to arrange our seating in a little
[42:50] different manner to create more seating
[42:54] we're going to put a little bit of space
[42:57] between the pews not quite as much as we
[43:00] have now and we're going to move some
[43:04] seating in the back but you know there
[43:08] comes a time you know as a pastor or a
[43:13] shepherd or whatever terminology that
[43:17] you want to give it you can't you can't
[43:22] watch everybody you can't do everything
[43:24] you know what I mean people make choices
[43:26] and you can give your advice the best
[43:30] that you can but in one regard you're
[43:34] just seeing it through your eyes and
[43:36] through your heart and so
[43:40] but there just comes a time when you
[43:42] you've got to trust the judgment of the
[43:44] people you can't make every decision for
[43:48] everybody you know if somebody would to
[43:52] go out and maybe buy a Dodge pickup you
[43:54] know I might think well that's piece of
[43:56] junk you know what I mean and I can't
[43:59] run over and say don't buy a Dodge don't
[44:01] buy a Dodge because you might say to me
[44:04] you want to buy one of those found on
[44:06] road dead cars you know or fix or repair
[44:10] daily you know so there's so many things
[44:13] that rely in opinion and at and if if
[44:17] you try to govern everybody's life if
[44:19] you try to fix everybody's circumstances
[44:23] it's literally impossible to keep your
[44:27] flesh from entering in to decisions it's
[44:32] just the way we are there's nobody I
[44:34] think that could testify that there are
[44:37] a hundred percent led by the Spirit of
[44:40] the Lord you know can everything that I
[44:43] do the Lord told me to do it
[44:47] I had a man tell me one time he said the
[44:50] Lord told me to go to the meeting in
[44:52] Minnesota
[44:54] I said praise the Lord he said but if I
[44:57] don't get a ride then I'm gonna do this
[45:01] well I'd walk if the Lord told me to go
[45:05] to a meeting in Minnesota but a lot of
[45:08] people aren't really led they feel
[45:13] something and you know one of the great
[45:15] parts of the message of the hour was not
[45:19] to go by sensations and things but so
[45:24] we're going to space the church seating
[45:27] out we're gonna provide as many seats as
[45:30] possible and we're gonna open the church
[45:33] to whoever wants to come it's your
[45:37] choice if you want to come we are
[45:41] keeping everybody apart and then you
[45:44] know I go by and visit some brothers
[45:46] there's four or five families all in
[45:48] there sitting around eating and and
[45:50] they're all together anyway we go out
[45:52] for coffee
[45:53] and we're all closer together and then
[45:55] we come to the house of God and we're
[45:58] all spread out you know and and so I
[46:01] think that there comes a time that it's
[46:04] your judgment so we're taking the
[46:07] restriction off for children under six
[46:12] if you want special distancing then you
[46:17] contact brother Jackson and and we'll
[46:22] make arrangements to give you special
[46:24] distancing there'll be a nice acceptable
[46:27] distancing you'll you'll have some more
[46:30] room in your feet like you have and so
[46:33] we want to do that in let me explain a
[46:36] few reasons why that we're doing this
[46:41] there are one thousand one hundred and
[46:44] seventy nine cases of the covert virus
[46:48] in Tarrant County okay that's how many
[46:53] cases there are there's been one case in
[46:56] Bedford there are two million one
[47:03] hundred and thirty thousand people in
[47:08] Tarrant County the number of people that
[47:13] have this virus is point zero zero zero
[47:20] five amongst that percentage the
[47:29] majority of those people have had
[47:33] underlining health conditions and are
[47:36] elderly and I don't see any elderly
[47:40] people in here deceive me
[47:47] everybody have any good with that okay
[47:50] so so that's what we're gonna do now I
[47:55] don't know who will come back I'm sure
[47:57] people are getting very comfortable
[47:58] being at home I'm sure maybe some have
[48:03] wax cold
[48:06] and have been drawn away but there's
[48:09] others who are just dying to come into
[48:11] the house of the Lord so if you're
[48:14] afraid that you might sit next to
[48:16] somebody then just make you know let
[48:20] somebody know let's follow the
[48:23] guidelines if you're sick don't come to
[48:26] church you have a temperature don't come
[48:29] to church if you've been you know if
[48:32] you've been in contact with an infected
[48:36] person don't come you know what I mean
[48:41] if you are worried about whether you
[48:44] have it or not get tested you know just
[48:49] use common sense but to continually not
[48:56] be able to serve God you know I just I I
[49:00] just remember I just the story just
[49:03] beats in my heart and I can hardly lay
[49:06] down without you know it just echoing
[49:09] through my mind as them scribes and
[49:15] Pharisees and the leaders the political
[49:19] leaders of Israel and Judea at those
[49:22] days telling Peter and the Apostles
[49:26] don't preach in this man's name any more
[49:31] and they had one question what is it
[49:35] better for us to serve God or deserve
[49:38] man and it just comes to a time where
[49:42] it's not my choice to make you
[49:46] understand I will do everything I can to
[49:48] follow the guidelines to provide hand
[49:51] sanitizer you're welcome to wear a mask
[49:53] you're welcome to wear gloves if you you
[49:58] want to you can do I'll take all your
[50:01] personal precautions that you want but
[50:05] you know it just tears my heart to leave
[50:08] people at home service after service
[50:10] with so many empty seats in in the house
[50:15] of the Lord so if you're afraid that
[50:18] there's
[50:19] going to be too many people and you
[50:21] don't want to be a part of them I
[50:23] understand and I can understand your
[50:27] point the rapture is not going to be
[50:29] crowded there gonna be lots and lots of
[50:34] space in the rapture you're not going to
[50:37] be worried about when you're flying
[50:39] through the sky that somebody's going to
[50:41] be too close to you but so we'll just
[50:46] use common sense will do our best we'll
[50:49] provide the safest environment that we
[50:51] can for you what we're going to make
[50:54] arrangement to put more people in the
[50:56] church that then we can and then we'll
[51:00] welcome and then one of these days we'll
[51:03] find out really how many people we
[51:05] really have you know and we'll go we'll
[51:11] go from there
[51:12] so the percentage of people that have
[51:15] this sickness in Carroll County is less
[51:18] than measles less than chickenpox less
[51:21] than mumps less than polio I mean it's
[51:26] just hardly nothing you know I know it's
[51:29] supposedly very contagious but it seems
[51:32] like healthy people are fine so the
[51:36] choice is yours in those that it might
[51:39] be watching tonight I know that we're
[51:42] getting less and less people watching
[51:45] and and that's okay too
[51:48] this is not a comfortable forum for me
[51:53] but anyway so we are certainly happy and
[51:58] then I think tonight is the last service
[52:02] that Lily Thomas axe gonna attend is a
[52:07] Thomas hat she's going to change her
[52:10] name can you imagine that anyway so
[52:14] we're really really happy for her and
[52:18] and and so anyway we're excited about
[52:23] that also in the next next Monday I'm
[52:31] going to have some
[52:33] surgery done on my hand I got I guess
[52:38] it's called Magnum core of corneal
[52:44] plastic such-and-such but anyway they go
[52:47] in here and they cut your thumb and then
[52:49] they take a bone the bone out of your
[52:52] thumb joint and then they go get a
[52:54] tendon out of your arm and then they cut
[52:58] your thing here and they drill a hole
[53:00] and they put a string in there and they
[53:05] well you say how do you know this
[53:07] because I was dumb enough to go watch
[53:09] the surgery online and so I'm gonna be
[53:14] six weeks in a cast and two weeks in
[53:18] bandages and six weeks in a castle I'm
[53:21] gonna try to get back in the pulpit as
[53:23] quick as I can
[53:24] I may not be able to preach the Sunday
[53:27] after the surgery but I'll try to come
[53:29] back just as soon as possible but the
[53:34] brothers have just been doing such a
[53:36] wonderful job that oh no and then maybe
[53:38] I might have somebody to come in and
[53:40] help me have a service or something for
[53:44] us but anyway do you love the Lord amen
[53:48] let's stand together and read a
[53:49] scripture and just a little sign of
[53:53] fellowship so just to remember
[53:55] everything we've done before wash your
[53:57] hands we're gonna leave that the buckets
[54:02] in the back we're not going to pass a
[54:04] plate we are going to be sitting a
[54:06] little closer together and the pews are
[54:09] going to be a little closer together but
[54:12] then we're just welcome whoever really
[54:14] wants to come to the house of the Lord
[54:16] and and it'll be good so you know like I
[54:21] said do all the things that you you've
[54:23] been brainwashed to do over and over and
[54:26] over and over again you know I think
[54:29] that they used to say that if they ever
[54:32] went out into space and found a word it
[54:38] would be I Love Lucy I think now it
[54:41] would be covert 19
[54:44] anyway so anyway let's turn to Joshua
[54:47] and let's have a little time of
[54:50] fellowship and and I'd like if I could
[54:53] say this as we go forward I'm trusting
[54:58] that that this will be the attitude that
[55:04] we go forward in to make a decision you
[55:09] make a decision and you put the decision
[55:11] back into the hands of the people you
[55:14] believe that they can pray about it you
[55:16] trust them to do what they feel is best
[55:19] for them and you support them in any way
[55:23] that you can but this read in Joshua 3
[55:26] these are great scriptures in Joshua
[55:29] chapter three one through four and
[55:33] Joshua rose early in the morning
[55:38] and they removed from system and came to
[55:44] Jordan and he and all the children of
[55:49] Israel and lodged there before they
[55:53] passed over and it came to pass after
[55:57] three days that the officers went
[56:03] through the host and they commanded the
[56:07] people saying when you see the Ark of
[56:11] the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[56:16] the priests the Levites bearing it then
[56:21] ye shall remove from your place and go
[56:27] after it yet therefore shall be a space
[56:34] between you and it about two thousand
[56:39] cubics by measure that's about three
[56:43] thousand feet come not near unto it that
[56:49] ye may know the way by which ye must go
[56:55] for ye have not passed
[56:57] this way hither to for our gracious
[57:03] father asks you to bless your word Amen
[57:06] god bless you may be seated
[57:08] a great a great time in the children of
[57:19] Israel's life after coming out of Egypt
[57:23] spending 40 years in the wilderness they
[57:28] were now passing over into the promised
[57:31] land and you know I like what Joshua's
[57:36] was he said now don't get so close to
[57:39] the ark because you know you need to see
[57:43] it you need to be able to follow it you
[57:46] know what I mean you need to and I also
[57:48] believe there was a measure of respect
[57:50] for it emphasized but you haven't been
[57:54] this way before so you need this ark to
[57:59] lead you and it was the Ark of the
[58:02] Covenant and you know we have a covenant
[58:06] every age has a covenant and the
[58:09] Covenant of God is the promises that he
[58:12] makes to you he makes a covenant with
[58:17] you and that covenant is if you believe
[58:20] me I will do this if do you believe me I
[58:27] will do this I will do this I will do
[58:30] this I will do this I will do this he's
[58:33] a God of promise he promises what he did
[58:37] and after all these years of since their
[58:41] unbelief and all the unbelief those that
[58:45] possessed unbelief and had disbelief the
[58:49] Word of God had passed out of the camp I
[58:53] always wonder that maybe even this great
[58:56] time that we're going through maybe it's
[58:59] a time that unbelief will pass out of
[59:03] the camp because the foundation of a
[59:07] church we talked a little bit Sunday
[59:09] about what is it that we're building
[59:11] whatever a man builds he's got to build
[59:14] it on the foundation and gods foundation
[59:17] is faith without faith it's impossible
[59:20] to please God there's nothing you can do
[59:24] that if you don't believe it's the Word
[59:26] of God and you don't believe that God's
[59:29] in it and you don't believe that God's
[59:32] leading you there's no way that that can
[59:35] please God you know we don't offer
[59:39] something to God and ask him to accept
[59:43] it on our terms
[59:44] that was the very problem in the garden
[59:48] in the beginning is that God required a
[59:52] sacrifice in and by revelation Abel
[59:56] offered a more excellent sacrifice but
[59:59] King wanted God to accept his sacrifice
[1:00:02] he wanted God to accept his offering he
[1:00:06] wanted God to accept the works of his
[1:00:09] hands he wanted some acknowledgment in
[1:00:12] the process and that that's human nature
[1:00:16] that we want acknowledgement in the
[1:00:19] process but but God is a God that makes
[1:00:24] a covenant with man he P tells what what
[1:00:28] the ground rules are for the Covenant
[1:00:31] what the what the what the basis on
[1:00:35] which the things shall be performed and
[1:00:38] and he says that if any man ask anything
[1:00:42] of me and my father's name I'll grant it
[1:00:44] what a promise what you have to believe
[1:00:47] that you understand and the scripture
[1:00:51] says that we have not because we ask not
[1:00:54] and we ask not because we believe not
[1:00:57] that faith has got to be a foundation by
[1:01:01] which that we go forward we have to
[1:01:04] believe in our election we have to
[1:01:07] believe that the path in which our
[1:01:10] election is leading us is the will of
[1:01:13] God in our lives
[1:01:15] many people have got in places where
[1:01:18] maybe they were raised in the Word of
[1:01:21] God maybe it was a family for just
[1:01:24] something that
[1:01:25] their family the way they was raised up
[1:01:27] I was raised up a Catholic so very many
[1:01:30] of the things I did the way they thought
[1:01:32] the way that I worshiped and everything
[1:01:34] was like a culture to me because that's
[1:01:37] what I was taught to do but there had to
[1:01:40] come a time where I found the leadership
[1:01:44] of the Lord we're aware of faith had to
[1:01:48] take hold not not instructions not
[1:01:51] obedience not things that's just like a
[1:01:55] young lady we teach our young ladies to
[1:01:57] wear dresses and every mother that
[1:02:00] understands the Word of God and
[1:02:02] understands morality understands the
[1:02:05] purpose and why that God made a woman
[1:02:08] the way that he made a woman and and the
[1:02:11] sacred vow that comes with womanhood it
[1:02:14] is going to want to lead her children in
[1:02:18] in the protection of that and and the
[1:02:22] end and the care of that and so
[1:02:26] naturally she's going to teach that
[1:02:27] child to to wear dresses and to and to
[1:02:31] live right and to you know why that we
[1:02:34] let our hair grow long and the things
[1:02:37] that go with it
[1:02:38] but yet a child many times will just
[1:02:41] accept those things of obedience they'll
[1:02:44] accept it because that their friends are
[1:02:47] doing it and in church that's where
[1:02:49] their friends are and maybe there's
[1:02:51] somebody at school that goes to school
[1:02:53] with them and that's a bond that they
[1:02:55] have and none of those things are wrong
[1:02:58] there that's the way you should do it
[1:03:00] because the Word of God says if you
[1:03:02] raise up a child in the way that it
[1:03:04] should go it will return there too so
[1:03:07] even in the times of their rebellion you
[1:03:11] hold fast to the Word of God when they
[1:03:13] go out the door and you know they're
[1:03:15] gonna go out the door and do something
[1:03:17] that's not maybe exactly right
[1:03:18] you speak the word olórin to them you
[1:03:22] tell them what the Lord says you tell
[1:03:24] them what the scripture says you know
[1:03:26] you remind them in the way that they go
[1:03:28] because you are got a covenant with God
[1:03:31] you got a promise with God you you're
[1:03:34] meeting your side of the Covenant and if
[1:03:37] you meet your side of AG of
[1:03:38] covenant God cannot lie because he
[1:03:42] because he couldn't swear on not whether
[1:03:44] he's took an oath upon himself that he
[1:03:47] would keep his word that he keep his
[1:03:49] promise and if any man ever comes to God
[1:03:53] and meets God on the same terms then God
[1:03:56] has to do it the same way every time
[1:03:59] that's why you hadn't your name had to
[1:04:02] be put in the Lamb's Book of Life before
[1:04:05] the foundation of the world because the
[1:04:07] first son of God came from the thoughts
[1:04:10] of God the first son of God in the
[1:04:12] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:04:14] with God and the Word was God and if God
[1:04:18] was ever going to have another son or
[1:04:20] another daughter he had to come from the
[1:04:23] same place
[1:04:24] the same way else God invented a
[1:04:26] different program God keeps us front of
[1:04:30] us hey man we've been talking about what
[1:04:34] are we building so we talked it a little
[1:04:37] bit and I appreciated the messages the
[1:04:40] brothers have been bringing about the
[1:04:42] seed but you know brother Brad never
[1:04:44] preached a message called the
[1:04:45] restoration of the bride seed he
[1:04:50] preached the restoration of the bride
[1:04:51] tree because that seed was going to grow
[1:04:55] into what that God planted it to be and
[1:04:59] we know that he planted us to be a body
[1:05:02] fitted and joined together and so as
[1:05:05] these children of Israel were moving in
[1:05:09] to the promised land now they had the
[1:05:13] promises but now they had to move into
[1:05:17] the land that was given for the promises
[1:05:21] and they just wasn't just a matter of
[1:05:24] moving in they had to move in and
[1:05:27] possess the land and that's why he
[1:05:32] wanted them to keep keep their eyes on
[1:05:34] the Covenant when you see that covenant
[1:05:37] go forth when you see that word of God
[1:05:39] go forth you see the dwelling place of
[1:05:42] the Lord go for it you follow it you
[1:05:45] stay in a position where that you can
[1:05:49] see it and it can lead
[1:05:51] because it's leading you into the land
[1:05:53] of promise a land of milk and honey a
[1:05:57] land up that after that you can have
[1:06:01] your generations and your children a
[1:06:04] land that you can worship the father a
[1:06:06] land that was given to you and given to
[1:06:09] your father Abraham and it was an
[1:06:11] inheritance to you can we know through
[1:06:15] the scriptures that the children of
[1:06:17] Israel and the mothers of Israel would
[1:06:19] cry out that their family inheritance
[1:06:22] over their children they would cry out
[1:06:25] the promises of God over their children
[1:06:28] that they were born and we ought to cry
[1:06:30] out the promises of God over our
[1:06:32] children too I don't care where they get
[1:06:35] I don't care who they married where
[1:06:37] they've been where they've gone they're
[1:06:39] still ours we still have them we can
[1:06:42] still claim them but we've got to move
[1:06:45] into that land of promise
[1:06:49] hey man I'm tired of the desert
[1:06:52] I'm tired of the testing I'm tired of
[1:06:55] the weeding out of the unbeliever
[1:06:57] because time to get with the people that
[1:07:00] want to go over it's time for those that
[1:07:02] are willing to say I'm more than able to
[1:07:05] keep the promises God's more than able
[1:07:07] to do what he said he would do I'm gonna
[1:07:10] believe it I'm gonna look for it I
[1:07:14] always have little day dreams I many
[1:07:18] times I Dre dream myself going across
[1:07:21] that Jordan River up with those Levites
[1:07:24] and and then I'm sorry I put myself
[1:07:26] right next to the Ark I I know I was
[1:07:30] supposed to save meat meters away but
[1:07:32] anyway I was right there
[1:07:33] but I thought when I stepped over I
[1:07:35] started looking for beehives I won look
[1:07:40] for honey this was the land that had it
[1:07:43] okay I would look for the promises of
[1:07:46] God okay and I believe that's what we
[1:07:48] ought to do when they entered into that
[1:07:50] land they clay they were told it was a
[1:07:52] good land it was a rich land it was a
[1:07:55] good land to plan it was a land with
[1:07:57] water beautiful land of Canada as they
[1:08:00] came out of that desert can you imagine
[1:08:01] how that
[1:08:02] looked like a little dry dirty old place
[1:08:08] out there they were glad to enter into
[1:08:11] the promised land but you know those
[1:08:13] before them they wanted to go back to
[1:08:16] Egypt they wanted garlic and leeks and
[1:08:19] and they wanted to go back they didn't
[1:08:22] they they lost sight of the promise they
[1:08:25] lost faith in the promise when it came
[1:08:27] to the challenge they didn't take the
[1:08:30] promise I wonder if there's a challenge
[1:08:31] been laid to us to move out of this
[1:08:34] doubt out of this fear out of out of
[1:08:38] this carnal living and go into a land of
[1:08:42] faith believing in one another trusting
[1:08:45] and one another praying one for another
[1:08:48] they meant having the leadership and
[1:08:53] that's what they have I believe that Ark
[1:08:55] and Joshua was a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:58] and was a type of a Word of God going
[1:09:01] before the believer it was a beautiful
[1:09:06] thing and they had to keep sight on
[1:09:08] God's Word they had to keep sight on the
[1:09:11] leader they had to understand who that
[1:09:14] their leader was because if that came
[1:09:16] out of sight he said you haven't been
[1:09:19] this way before if you've got to follow
[1:09:21] the Ark you've got to follow the priests
[1:09:24] you got to stay with this because you
[1:09:26] haven't passed this way before you don't
[1:09:28] know the way let me tell you something
[1:09:31] we don't know the way we haven't been
[1:09:33] this way but God sent us a word one of
[1:09:36] the last messages the prophet of God
[1:09:38] preached was leadership he tried to lay
[1:09:40] it down there that the word was stored
[1:09:43] up and it was a leader we kept our eyes
[1:09:48] on it it would lead us into all truth
[1:09:54] into all righteousness it was it was a
[1:09:59] given to us as a guide how many messages
[1:10:05] did we hear about a guide about an
[1:10:09] absolute about a seer
[1:10:16] someone that could pull themselves up
[1:10:18] over the fence and see what's there and
[1:10:22] then come back and share this is what's
[1:10:25] ahead this is what's happening how many
[1:10:27] things in these last five years even
[1:10:30] have we seen come to pass that were
[1:10:34] spoken to us every man what a call to
[1:10:40] the promised land
[1:10:41] I really believe we're being called to
[1:10:44] the promised land I believe that that I
[1:10:47] believe the unbelievers will stay away
[1:10:51] those who have got a taste of the world
[1:10:53] and the things of the world and they
[1:10:55] like the taste thereof they'll just get
[1:11:00] it oh you say no they know that's what
[1:11:03] Satan that was what Satan did taste it
[1:11:06] and you'll see that it's good try it
[1:11:10] surely you won't die but you'll be a
[1:11:15] better Christian than you ever been you
[1:11:18] can be a Christian and still eat you can
[1:11:20] be a Christian and still do this you can
[1:11:22] be a Christian and still that you can
[1:11:24] still believe the message I can stay
[1:11:28] home you can just do this and do that
[1:11:30] but that's not what the leader says not
[1:11:33] what the Spirit of God said it's not
[1:11:35] what the Word of God says the scripture
[1:11:37] says as you see the Day approaching
[1:11:39] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:11:41] together as you see that Day approaching
[1:11:44] you know why people don't see it symbol
[1:11:46] themselves together they don't see the
[1:11:48] Day approaching but they never recognize
[1:11:51] the day in its message they never
[1:11:53] understood that it wasn't brother
[1:11:55] Branham wasn't telling us to to follow
[1:11:58] him he was saying if you could see that
[1:12:01] this is Jesus Christ veiled in my flesh
[1:12:04] it's whatever he says it's I'm just
[1:12:07] preaching what he's telling me to preach
[1:12:09] this is the Word of God he's giving you
[1:12:12] the Word of God I'm just a vessel he
[1:12:15] said I know you resent this but I am the
[1:12:18] voice of God to you he was a shout the
[1:12:25] Trump
[1:12:27] it was the Word of God calling out a
[1:12:30] people my sheep know my voice and
[1:12:32] another they won't follow it was the
[1:12:34] gathering together about electing it was
[1:12:38] those tenets we're hungry and thirsting
[1:12:41] after righteousness those that had a
[1:12:43] hunger for the leadership of the Spirit
[1:12:46] those who knows I haven't been this way
[1:12:49] before but nowadays everybody wants to
[1:12:54] figure out the map it's nice to know
[1:13:00] where you been
[1:13:02] but it's really good to understand you
[1:13:05] don't know where you're going you can
[1:13:08] never determine where you're going by
[1:13:11] where you've been you've got to have an
[1:13:15] understanding I've got to know where to
[1:13:18] go at the fork of the road I've got to
[1:13:21] know which way to turn
[1:13:22] at the tee I've got to know which exit
[1:13:26] to take at the circle who you get to
[1:13:32] rely on you've got to rely on the ark
[1:13:37] you've got to rely on the Word of God
[1:13:40] you've got to have you've got to have
[1:13:43] some a connection in your heart where
[1:13:46] that you sit down and you pray and can
[1:13:49] you know and you're confident and you
[1:13:52] had that unction of the Holy Spirit and
[1:13:55] you make your steps based on your the
[1:13:59] choice that you've seen in the Word of
[1:14:02] God you say well what if I make a
[1:14:04] mistake you approach God that way and
[1:14:06] he'll tell you if you take the
[1:14:08] permissive will he'll take them
[1:14:10] permissive will and work it out to His
[1:14:11] perfect will because he made a covenant
[1:14:14] with you and if you have a pure heart
[1:14:16] and you have a pure desire and your
[1:14:19] desires to serve God sure we'll make
[1:14:21] mistakes aren't you glad you have a
[1:14:25] Shepherd I'll guarantee you most of the
[1:14:28] leadership I've had in my life has been
[1:14:30] out of mistakes lead me out of this mess
[1:14:34] leading me out of that mess lead me out
[1:14:37] of this mistake fixing what I said here
[1:14:40] fixing what
[1:14:40] I said there why because he promised I
[1:14:43] will not leave you nor forsake you but I
[1:14:45] will lead you and I will guide you so we
[1:14:51] know that this Great Spirit of God that
[1:14:56] we understand that it's a time now in
[1:15:02] our lives that every individual has to
[1:15:06] be sensitive to the leadership of the
[1:15:10] Holy Spirit they have to know from
[1:15:14] whence that God speaks God speaks from
[1:15:19] his word they have to recognize the
[1:15:23] spirit in the word I am the way the
[1:15:27] truth the life he said my words are
[1:15:30] spirit and truth
[1:15:33] amen is it's not it's not a leadership
[1:15:37] without the word you don't get an
[1:15:41] unction you don't get a move of the
[1:15:42] Spirit and contrary the word the one
[1:15:46] lady one time told them our messenger he
[1:15:48] says she said to him he says that God
[1:15:50] called me to preach he never argued
[1:15:57] sister I have no doubt he did I just
[1:16:00] want you to know it's not according to
[1:16:02] the Word of God and then how many times
[1:16:07] have you heard him say the Spirit of God
[1:16:09] lead you to do something contrary to the
[1:16:13] Word of God it can't be so because the
[1:16:16] Spirit of God didn't even come to
[1:16:18] testify of itself it come to testify of
[1:16:21] the word What did he say the Holy Spirit
[1:16:23] would do he said the Holy Spirit would
[1:16:25] bring you into remembrance of all the
[1:16:28] things that I have spoken and that's why
[1:16:32] it you have to have such a great
[1:16:34] understanding that this message was the
[1:16:37] message the things that God put on his
[1:16:40] heart to be spoken the the word that was
[1:16:44] within the word the love letter that was
[1:16:48] within the sermons the the revelation
[1:16:52] that
[1:16:53] hid in the Gospels to be delivered to
[1:16:56] the elect that love letter that was him
[1:17:00] speaking to the heart of his bride that
[1:17:05] was personal between him and you
[1:17:08] it can't be organized it can't be
[1:17:12] figured out it can't be
[1:17:15] dogma it turned into Dogma it can't be
[1:17:19] turned into Creed's
[1:17:20] if we can't form a catechism out of it
[1:17:23] we can't create our own doctrines and
[1:17:25] our own way of doing things and and and
[1:17:28] we are not the interpreters of it
[1:17:31] he's the interpreter to your heart it's
[1:17:33] a love affair between you and him it's
[1:17:36] an ongoing thing every day Paul said I
[1:17:41] die daily IIIi have I have something in
[1:17:47] the heart I have a hunger and a thirst
[1:17:50] for the so we understand that that
[1:17:55] we haven't been this way before
[1:17:58] and I believe that we've feasted on the
[1:18:04] fulfillment of the promises of the past
[1:18:09] we feasted on the stories we feasted on
[1:18:13] the testimonies we feasted on the things
[1:18:16] that that we've seen that God's done
[1:18:18] well I I feast on the book of Acts still
[1:18:22] but we've been told that in this age
[1:18:26] there would be another book of Acts
[1:18:28] written that there would be testimonies
[1:18:31] rise up out of the mouths of the
[1:18:33] believer to give praise to God that he's
[1:18:36] alive and that he's moving in the midst
[1:18:38] of his people and he's performing and
[1:18:41] doing things that they've asked him to
[1:18:43] do and they're giving him glory and
[1:18:45] they're testifying about the mighty work
[1:18:48] of his hand in their lives fresh manna
[1:18:54] not new man fresh manna from the
[1:18:58] storehouse there's not going to be an
[1:19:00] eighth messenger there's not going to be
[1:19:02] another love letter written there's not
[1:19:04] going to be another gospel preached let
[1:19:06] me do
[1:19:06] we haven't even begin to open the
[1:19:09] beginning of the riches that are
[1:19:12] contained in God's word for us let us
[1:19:18] look at a little bit this evening
[1:19:22] because I believe it's time that the
[1:19:28] figs and the trees and the palms and the
[1:19:32] seeds that they carried out of the
[1:19:35] desert now the problem into the promised
[1:19:38] land it's time for those to be planted
[1:19:41] it's time for those to start flourishing
[1:19:44] and bringing forth fruit when it when it
[1:19:48] finally came to the explanation and
[1:19:52] description of this elect lady there
[1:19:56] were two great descriptions of her
[1:20:00] he said one they will you will know that
[1:20:02] they are my disciples by their love one
[1:20:06] for another Oh certainly it had to do
[1:20:12] something about that capstone in the
[1:20:15] life of a statue of a perfect man it was
[1:20:20] just it was just this great description
[1:20:23] and the other description was you'll
[1:20:26] know them by their fruits and I'd like
[1:20:33] to talk if I could just a few moments
[1:20:37] this evening about going forward even at
[1:20:42] the decision that we've made to go ahead
[1:20:46] and place coming to church in your hands
[1:20:53] I'm not going to be the governor anymore
[1:21:00] the choice is yours my job is to preach
[1:21:04] the gospel to whosoever will to lay my
[1:21:09] hands on the sick because their promises
[1:21:13] that they shall recover
[1:21:15] if you want your child dedicated I'm
[1:21:19] here to stand with you shoulder to
[1:21:23] shoulder as we together and the
[1:21:25] congregation together dedicates your
[1:21:28] children to the Lord if there it comes
[1:21:32] time to be married and it you would so
[1:21:36] choose then I would officiate over your
[1:21:41] vows and you would confess your vows and
[1:21:46] we would lay our hands and we would pray
[1:21:49] and ask God to bless you as you started
[1:21:54] your journey in life but there's some
[1:21:59] choices that people can't make for you I
[1:22:04] thought it was so beautiful we sang that
[1:22:06] song I am no longer a slave to fear
[1:22:14] you say brother McGary could you die yes
[1:22:17] I never was promised that I wouldn't
[1:22:25] physically die I was just promised that
[1:22:28] I wouldn't die you know
[1:22:41] but I was promised that if I was to die
[1:22:43] that I have a body waiting for me that
[1:22:48] I'll meet one day be caught up and those
[1:22:51] which are alive and remain wouldn't
[1:22:53] hinder me and that I have a day in the
[1:22:56] day of coming and a day of promise
[1:23:01] because so I'd like to just take a
[1:23:03] moment to talk about the leadership of
[1:23:14] the Holy Spirit because something is
[1:23:18] known by its fruits and if a man is
[1:23:22] known by its fruits even Jesus said if
[1:23:27] you don't believe me for what that I say
[1:23:31] look at my fruits look at my works look
[1:23:38] at what I produce look at what follows
[1:23:42] me I've seen great men great orders but
[1:23:48] all they leave behind them as shipwrecks
[1:23:51] and car wrecks and destroyed lives there
[1:23:56] there's no prosperity and I don't mean
[1:23:58] worldly prosperity
[1:24:00] I mean prosperous in the spirit that
[1:24:03] following just confusion people aren't
[1:24:08] at rest they're not happy they're
[1:24:11] they're always scared I remember I went
[1:24:17] to help a man one time and and so this
[1:24:21] man who he asked me to come was out of
[1:24:24] state to help me do some electrical work
[1:24:27] on his house and I went and I had to
[1:24:30] leave and I I remember I kind of miss
[1:24:32] church that Wednesday night and it
[1:24:34] wasn't about you know all of a sudden
[1:24:37] about two or three hours later here
[1:24:39] comes four or five deacons over wanting
[1:24:43] to know where I was I mean you don't
[1:24:48] know where I was I was right here
[1:24:53] and their whole point you know and I
[1:24:55] thought you know it's funny admit you
[1:24:59] want me to go there out of fear to keep
[1:25:09] your rules instead of it being in my
[1:25:16] heart I said what kind of fruit is that
[1:25:21] I kept a rule I kept your rule not even
[1:25:28] my church
[1:25:28] not even my pastor now I believe in
[1:25:33] going to church but if I could say that
[1:25:36] is the ox in the ditch I started to do
[1:25:40] something there to help somebody I had
[1:25:42] to get his house done he was in a bind I
[1:25:44] flew thousands of miles to help him out
[1:25:49] had to had to stay right on the job hour
[1:25:52] after hour after hour and yet the spirit
[1:25:56] of it is all wrong so let's talk about
[1:26:01] the leadership of the Holy Spirit if you
[1:26:07] turn to me in Galatians
[1:26:23] and we could read starting with the 19th
[1:26:28] verse or even the 18th birth but if ye
[1:26:35] be led of the Spirit ye are not under
[1:26:39] the law now the works of the flesh are
[1:26:47] manifested which are these adultery
[1:26:51] fornication uncleanness lavishness I
[1:26:56] adultery witchcraft hatred variance
[1:26:58] emulations wrath strife seditions
[1:27:02] heresies in these murders drunkenness
[1:27:06] revellings and such like of which I have
[1:27:11] told you before as i have also told you
[1:27:14] in times past that they which do such
[1:27:17] things shall not inherit the kingdom of
[1:27:20] God but now listen but the fruit of the
[1:27:26] Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering
[1:27:37] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[1:27:42] temperance against such there is no law
[1:27:51] these are the fruit of the Spirit so if
[1:27:59] if they're the fruits of the spirit
[1:28:07] they're what the Spirit brings wherever
[1:28:12] the spirit goes these go with him there
[1:28:17] they're always there there's never a
[1:28:19] leadership without the fruits of the
[1:28:23] spirit look when the spirit leads and
[1:28:29] the the spirit moves and the spirit
[1:28:34] guide
[1:28:35] and directs the result of his leadership
[1:28:41] the result of his direction the result
[1:28:46] of his instruction always bears these
[1:28:50] fruits there what follows there's what
[1:28:55] the spirit produces this is what the
[1:28:59] leadership of the spirit produces it
[1:29:03] produces love it produces joy if the
[1:29:08] Spirit of God leads you there will be
[1:29:11] love and joy and long-suffering and
[1:29:14] goodness and godliness and faith and
[1:29:17] meekness and temperance those things
[1:29:21] there are part of the leadership the
[1:29:24] Holy Spirit doesn't go anywhere or do
[1:29:27] anything without these fruits being
[1:29:30] present
[1:29:31] it is the fruits the fruit is the
[1:29:35] product this is what the Holy Spirit
[1:29:39] produces this is what you can expect it
[1:29:43] to be in your life when you're led of
[1:29:47] the Spirit don't tell me you're led of
[1:29:49] the Spirit and miserable now you may be
[1:29:55] tempted you may be tested you may be
[1:29:59] tried we were fellowship with the
[1:30:03] brothers and and when we listened to
[1:30:06] that tape last week brother bands that
[1:30:09] I've been in Tucson three and a half
[1:30:11] years and I've suffered and he had
[1:30:17] suffered nobody had called him to preach
[1:30:20] the full guilt gospel businessman at
[1:30:23] that time they they they were turning
[1:30:27] away from brother Branham and they were
[1:30:30] beginning to follow Katherine Coleman
[1:30:33] you want to know Katherine Coleman Benny
[1:30:37] Hinn is Katherine Coleman without a
[1:30:39] dress on it's the truth it's just all he
[1:30:47] did
[1:30:48] he picked her words up he picked her
[1:30:51] style up
[1:30:52] he picked everything she did up and he's
[1:30:54] a reimburse ination of Katherine Coleman
[1:30:57] and that's where they were turning they
[1:31:01] were turning to everything that he
[1:31:03] warned him about everything he stood
[1:31:05] against everything that suffered
[1:31:07] everything that he had been through and
[1:31:10] you felt it in his voice and they didn't
[1:31:17] accept the seals they had rejected the
[1:31:23] message they wanted something more
[1:31:26] spectacular praise God for an elective
[1:31:29] and praise God that this message is
[1:31:33] living in flesh not just left on paper
[1:31:36] not just left on recording but this word
[1:31:39] is producing a real living people
[1:31:44] because they've been washed by the water
[1:31:46] of the word bill seed has come to life
[1:31:50] and it's begin to put forth branches and
[1:31:53] it's beginning to bear fruit so anytime
[1:31:59] the spirit moves these fruits are
[1:32:04] present and even in brother branham
[1:32:08] suffering he had a deep peace in his
[1:32:11] heart that he did what God told him to
[1:32:14] do any explained I had to come to the
[1:32:18] desert because Moses went to the desert
[1:32:23] Paul went to the desert to end if this
[1:32:27] was the Word of God that I had to come
[1:32:30] to the desert to now you might look at
[1:32:33] Tucson now and think it's something but
[1:32:38] back in the early 60s Tucson was a dump
[1:32:43] and you've heard the spiritual
[1:32:47] description that brother Branham gave at
[1:32:50] Tucson so it doesn't matter what's on
[1:32:56] the outside God worked from the inside
[1:33:01] and he promised to give us a peace that
[1:33:04] surpasses understanding joy unspeakable
[1:33:08] and full of glory he promised to be a
[1:33:13] comforter so every time the Spirit of
[1:33:18] God moves these are what follows these
[1:33:27] this these are the the things that the
[1:33:30] believer inherits every time he leads
[1:33:35] you he only can move with his fruits
[1:33:41] that his manifestation
[1:33:47] he's manifested in his fruits if but you
[1:33:53] know how you feel you know God you might
[1:33:56] not find out something about somebody
[1:33:58] maybe something they said something they
[1:34:01] did I can tell you right away how you
[1:34:04] know whether it's the Spirit of God or
[1:34:06] not how does it make you feel towards
[1:34:08] that person if it makes you bitter and
[1:34:14] it makes you just to have to despise
[1:34:22] them or to be disgusted or to say oh I I
[1:34:27] just can't believe it if it puts a
[1:34:30] gossip Anya you got to find that
[1:34:36] one person you can confide in so they
[1:34:39] can tell the one person they can fight
[1:34:41] in who the one person they could confide
[1:34:43] in you know gossips foundation is don't
[1:34:47] tell nobody I'm only telling you I
[1:34:54] wouldn't say this to everyone but I can
[1:34:59] trust you the tongue is an unruly member
[1:35:05] very hard to hold down you couldn't hold
[1:35:09] it how do you expect your confidant to
[1:35:13] hold it
[1:35:15] it ate you alive how you expecting not
[1:35:20] to eat somebody else alive but it makes
[1:35:25] you how you feel what's the fruit of it
[1:35:28] the problem of godson if you destroy
[1:35:30] somebody's character that's murder if
[1:35:33] you destroy their influence
[1:35:36] if you repeat something that no longer
[1:35:39] makes that person effective in somebody
[1:35:42] else's life you have murdered them don't
[1:35:49] listen I hear a lot of things a lot of
[1:35:57] things I just blow off I don't want to
[1:35:59] know but if I hear something that
[1:36:01] disturbs me I find that person I call
[1:36:04] him up and I talked to him I said this
[1:36:11] and this and this is what I heard and
[1:36:12] when they say well who told you I tell
[1:36:15] them oh yeah because that's who they
[1:36:26] need to get the phone call from oh yeah
[1:36:29] this is brother such-and-such the one
[1:36:31] you've been running down I've just
[1:36:35] called you up to let you know I forgive
[1:36:37] you and I really hope that you can pray
[1:36:41] through some day and that the love of
[1:36:44] God will feed your heart just put it
[1:36:47] back in their ball park how it makes you
[1:36:51] feel the atmosphere it creates the what
[1:37:00] comes along with it and when the Spirit
[1:37:03] of God moves these are the things that
[1:37:06] come with it he never moves without them
[1:37:12] he's never manifested in any other way
[1:37:17] outside his fruits it's by his fruits
[1:37:21] that you know him so if he says
[1:37:26] something's a
[1:37:28] if I'd buy their fruits he can't make
[1:37:30] another rule even creation every seed
[1:37:38] will bring forth of its kind in other
[1:37:41] words you'll know the kind by its fruit
[1:37:49] you know coffee tree by the bean did you
[1:37:54] know I didn't even know it was a tree I
[1:37:57] thought it was a bush but you know them
[1:38:02] by their fruits
[1:38:02] so do you understand what I'm trying to
[1:38:04] say the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:38:07] the land of promise where he's leading
[1:38:10] us and what he's leading us to can only
[1:38:14] produce these fruits that's what the a
[1:38:21] tree does it's what it produces what
[1:38:25] does the Holy Spirit produce what comes
[1:38:30] from the Holy Spirit
[1:38:31] what is the result of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:33] what is the result of being in the
[1:38:35] presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:37] what is the result of hearing from the
[1:38:39] Holy Spirit what is the result for being
[1:38:41] led by the Holy Spirit these fruits are
[1:38:43] what the Holy Spirit brings and the
[1:38:46] scripture says against such there is no
[1:38:50] law in other words there's no
[1:38:54] circumstance no time no circumstance
[1:38:58] that these fruits are not in play there
[1:39:04] there's there there is no move that the
[1:39:09] Spirit makes without them in other words
[1:39:13] there's nothing that stops it nothing
[1:39:17] that hinders it no circumstances if the
[1:39:21] spirits there the fruits are there
[1:39:23] there's no law governing or stopping or
[1:39:27] keeping these fruits from being present
[1:39:31] when God's there there's no restriction
[1:39:36] or circumstance there's no law that's
[1:39:39] what a law is a laws a restriction
[1:39:45] it's it's a confinement to circumstances
[1:39:51] or procedures you might call it rule the
[1:39:56] rule of law this is what we do you do
[1:39:59] this we do that the rule of law
[1:40:01] but there's no circumstances no
[1:40:03] procedures no restrictions no barriers
[1:40:06] these fruits of the spirit go where he
[1:40:10] goes and there's nothing stops him
[1:40:13] he moves where he wants to move he
[1:40:15] blesses who he wants to bless he does
[1:40:17] what he wants to do he's sovereign God
[1:40:23] that's a promise I will not lead you
[1:40:27] comfortless I'll come again I'll be
[1:40:31] there love will be there joy will be
[1:40:35] there peace will be there long-suffering
[1:40:37] gentleness godliness goodness faith
[1:40:40] meekness temperance they'll all be there
[1:40:43] there's nothing restriction so there's
[1:40:45] no law nothing holding back you have the
[1:40:49] spirit into life you have these they
[1:40:54] didn't say they were your fruits they
[1:40:56] were his fruits they're what he produces
[1:40:59] in your life they're the things that the
[1:41:02] effect he has on you the things that
[1:41:06] hold you just think leading us into a
[1:41:11] land of promise they were promised milk
[1:41:16] and honey figs and dates and fruits and
[1:41:21] fields cattle and sheep and abundance
[1:41:29] were promised joy and rest and comfort
[1:41:36] and satisfaction
[1:41:42] they're the fruits there's no law no
[1:41:47] restriction how do we know when we're
[1:41:51] being led by the spirit how do we know
[1:41:56] when he's present by his fruits you will
[1:42:03] know him by his spirit you will know him
[1:42:08] the love of God is shed abroad in your
[1:42:12] heart by the Holy Spirit what a place to
[1:42:17] move in what a thing to build to build a
[1:42:22] life that's led by this spirit so the
[1:42:28] atmosphere that surround you is these
[1:42:31] fruits what it's producing in your life
[1:42:34] is these fruits what you're shedding is
[1:42:37] these fruits because first of all it's
[1:42:42] possession then it's projection the tree
[1:42:47] comes up and it bears fruit and now the
[1:42:52] fruit isn't there no more just to be
[1:42:56] produced it's now there to be projected
[1:43:00] or shared or eaten or shed abroad and
[1:43:04] when Jesus came to the fig tree the fig
[1:43:07] tree no longer fulfilled its purpose he
[1:43:10] said your ear barren you have no fruit
[1:43:16] so it withered away because it never
[1:43:23] went to the stage of projecting it never
[1:43:28] went to the stage where it came time to
[1:43:30] eat so we know that that the spirit this
[1:43:36] is the spirit described the holy spirit
[1:43:40] you can describe these feet fruits the
[1:43:44] holy spirit is love joy peace
[1:43:51] long suffering temperance meekness
[1:43:54] there's no circumstance that those can't
[1:43:58] prevail and be alive in our life I want
[1:44:02] to move forward don't you we haven't
[1:44:05] been this way before but if I go this
[1:44:08] way into this new country into this new
[1:44:13] legal system into this new way of eating
[1:44:17] and shopping and all this new way that
[1:44:20] it's going to be new way of sports a new
[1:44:23] way of this a new way of that and all
[1:44:25] the way we've never been before I want
[1:44:28] to go with him I want to go with the
[1:44:32] fruits of the spirit I want to go with
[1:44:34] joy and peace and love and
[1:44:36] long-suffering and temperance I want to
[1:44:39] go with my candle lit and my light
[1:44:42] burning god bless you tonight let's
[1:44:46] stand together
[1:45:04] if you feel at all tonight that you're
[1:45:11] lacking the Spirit of God tells us to
[1:45:17] ask and you say well how do I get this
[1:45:23] get him
[1:45:27] he asked he told the people he says
[1:45:30] don't seek gift seek the giver and
[1:45:36] there's one thing you can be certain of
[1:45:39] one thing you can be positive one thing
[1:45:43] that you can rest on when the spirit is
[1:45:48] there these fruits are present and when
[1:45:55] the spirit touches your life the
[1:45:59] evidence of his touch in your life is
[1:46:03] these fruits the joy you feel the love
[1:46:10] you feel the meekness you have the
[1:46:14] temperance you have the patience you
[1:46:17] have the long-suffering you have it's a
[1:46:21] result oh what a wonderful result thank
[1:46:26] you Lord in your heart tonight I'm not
[1:46:34] questioning what you believe
[1:46:38] but has it been a long time since you've
[1:46:40] felt good fruits of the Spirit in your
[1:46:44] life
[1:46:44] and you just like to stop for just a
[1:46:49] moment whether you're here whether
[1:46:52] you're watching maybe you're watching
[1:46:55] later I'll tell you it's not the same
[1:47:01] but you just like to say Lord I I need
[1:47:04] contactors I need that I need the result
[1:47:08] of these in my life I need some peace in
[1:47:12] my life and he's in joy in my life I
[1:47:16] need some love in my life I need some
[1:47:21] long-suffering in my life I need some
[1:47:24] meekness in my life I need some
[1:47:26] temperance in my life lord I need your
[1:47:29] spirit in my life and you promised that
[1:47:36] when you come you bring these things
[1:47:38] with you and I asked for it I asked you
[1:47:43] to help his fatherís
[1:47:44] as a body of believers we go forward
[1:47:48] we've never been this way before Lord
[1:47:52] but we know we want to go by faith but I
[1:47:58] thought as we talked about how that your
[1:48:00] messenger went to Tucson he was led he
[1:48:05] just brought clothes stayed in a little
[1:48:09] apartment building didn't know what to
[1:48:11] do
