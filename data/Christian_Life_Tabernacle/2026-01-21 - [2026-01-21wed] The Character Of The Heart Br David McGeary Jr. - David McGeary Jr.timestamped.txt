[23:20] Ben is a special man if he could bring
[23:22] it at this time.
[23:51] God bless you, saints.
[23:56] Somehow throughout [music] the the week
[23:59] while studying, I fell upon uh this
[24:01] story and it it touched my heart. I want
[24:03] to share it to you.
[24:06] The man's name is uh Joseph Metalcott
[24:10] [music] Scriven and he was born in
[24:13] Dublin, Ireland. And uh while he was
[24:17] attending college, he met his what he
[24:19] would call his sweetheart.
[24:21] And uh before they got married, [music]
[24:25] she fell off her horse and drowned and
[24:28] she passed away.
[24:30] And it hurt him so much that he moved
[24:33] and went to Canada [music] and lived his
[24:35] life as a poor man helping others that
[24:37] were in need. [music] And his heart was
[24:41] never truly healed. But he had met
[24:44] somebody and the night before their
[24:47] wedding she passed away as [music] well.
[24:50] And so just so much on his heart not
[24:53] fully have [music] healed from the first
[24:54] passing. Then he got a letter finding
[24:57] out that his mother back in Dublin was
[25:00] sick
[25:02] and he wrote her cuz he couldn't go see
[25:05] her. He wrote her a poem and the poem is
[25:09] [music] as we know it the song What a
[25:10] Friend We Have in Jesus.
[25:14] You may not be able to enter in [music]
[25:16] in the exact same pain that he had, but
[25:20] if he can look at the pain he went
[25:21] through and still [music] say, "I've got
[25:22] a friend in Jesus." How much more us
[25:25] with what we go through.
[25:28] And what a friend we have in Jesus
[25:36] and [singing and music] all our sins and
[25:39] griefs to bear.
[25:43] And what a privilege [singing]
[25:47] to [music] car
[25:50] bring
[25:51] [singing]
[25:53] everything [music] to God in prayer.
[25:58] And oh
[26:00] what [music] peace we often fall
[26:04] on [singing] faith.
[26:06] And all [music]
[26:08] what needless [singing] pain we bear.
[26:14] And all
[26:15] because [singing]
[26:16] we do not [music] care.
[26:20] Bring all
[26:23] everything to [singing] God in prayer.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:29] &gt;&gt; In hell we trials and temptations
[26:32] [singing]
[26:36] [music] is their [singing] tray
[26:44] and [singing] we
[26:45] should never be discouraged. [music]
[26:50] [singing] Oh take
[26:53] it to the Lord and pray. [singing]
[26:58] Oh, [music]
[27:01] I [singing] find a friend so faithful.
[27:07] Oh, [music] will [singing] all my sorrow
[27:10] sh

[27:16] [singing]
[27:19] weakness.

[27:29] And all we we [singing]
[27:35] [music]

[27:54] it [music] to the Lord in prayer.

[28:02] despise, [music]
[28:03] forsake
[28:05] me. Oh, [singing] take it to [music] the
[28:10] Lord and pray.
[28:14] Oh, when in his [singing] arms he can
[28:19] shield [music]
[28:21] me. Oh, and thou will find a soul
[28:26] [music] this day. Sing that verse again.
[28:29] Oh, [singing] and on we [music] we
[28:36] [music]
[28:39] [singing] burn with the Lord of King.

[28:55] the Lord and pray.

[29:04] [singing] forsake

[32:26] thanks to our Lord uh our Lord Jesus for
[32:29] his mercy. This past weekend, brother
[32:32] Sergio went to preach in Arkansas and we
[32:35] forgot the keys of the car in uh uh in
[32:38] Sunday morning, but the Lord helped us
[32:41] and we were able to get the keys back
[32:43] without calling a company. Amen. Praise
[32:46] the Lord. Amen.
[32:50] Amen. [applause]
[32:52] Amen. I I tell you, we we have more
[32:56] reasons to praise him. His goodness will
[32:59] endure forever. Everything that he does
[33:02] for us, both great and small and all of
[33:05] that, we just want to praise him for
[33:06] that. Amen. Want to remember those that
[33:09] are traveling and I know brother Matt
[33:11] Thomas is out. Brother Matthew is
[33:12] probably out, those that are traveling
[33:14] that the Lord will be with them. It's
[33:16] good to see brother Joeman back in the

[42:01] Oh, come exalt
[42:04] his name
[42:06] forever.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Let's just go before him. Heavenly
[42:12] Father, [music] we truly desire to exalt
[42:14] you, Lord, and Lord, to have hearts that
[42:17] come together into one mind and one
[42:19] accord. And lift up your praise, Father,
[42:22] for the good things that you've [music]
[42:23] done. And Lord, how you've preserved us
[42:25] and how you've kept us and how you've
[42:27] allowed us to come into your house once
[42:29] again. And Lord, we just ask as we sung
[42:32] these praises [music] that they're sweet
[42:33] to you, Father. And Lord, that you're
[42:35] pleased to come now. And just [music]
[42:37] take your word, Father, and break it to
[42:39] us. We know that in your word, Father,
[42:42] there's life. There's healing. And Lord,
[42:44] it's in your word that we know your very
[42:46] heart and mind, [music] Father. We ask
[42:47] that you would break your word to us
[42:49] now. commit ourselves to you, asking
[42:51] that you'd be glorified in the precious
[42:53] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[42:55] Christ. [music] We pray. Amen. While
[42:57] you're standing, if you'd turn in your
[42:59] Bibles with me, we're going to be taking
[43:02] the text out of Matthew chapter 15. And
[43:05] trust we won't uh be too long. We know
[43:08] probably the the longer we're in here,
[43:10] the colder it's going to get out there.
[43:12] But I I uh felt a little convicted last
[43:15] time. I didn't read some quotes. And
[43:17] really the uh
[43:20] you know that was on me cuz later on I'm
[43:22] like well everybody stayed in the
[43:24] parking lot for an hour and
[43:25] fellowshipped and and I could have taken
[43:27] the time to to read the the quotes and
[43:30] the sources. So you just pray the Lord
[43:31] has his way. You know we we can't come
[43:34] with a premeditated mind and if we're
[43:36] just leaving it to man it's you know if
[43:39] God's not in it it's it's nothing. But
[43:42] we just ask that he would come and he
[43:44] would minister to the needs that we
[43:46] have. Out of Matthew chapter 15, reading
[43:50] uh from verse one, then came Jesus to
[43:52] the scribes and the Pharisees which were
[43:55] of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy
[43:57] disciples transgress the tradition of
[44:00] the elders? For they wash not their
[44:02] hands when they eat bread. But he
[44:05] answered and said unto them, Why do ye
[44:07] also transgress the commandments of God
[44:10] by your tradition? For God commanded,
[44:12] saying, "Honor thy father and mother,
[44:15] and he that cursseth father or mother,
[44:17] let him die the death." But ye say,
[44:19] "Whosoever shall say to his father or
[44:21] mother, it is a gift by whatsoever thou
[44:25] mightest be profited by me, and honorth
[44:28] not his father or mother, he [snorts]
[44:30] shall be free." So he's he's reciting
[44:33] back to the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[44:35] a a law or proclamation that they've
[44:38] made of the commandments of God. And he
[44:40] goes, "And you know, now that I'm a son,
[44:43] I owe nothing to my parents because
[44:45] everything that you've done unto me,
[44:46] you've done unto God. So consider it.
[44:49] We're even. And I don't need to do
[44:52] nothing for you. I don't need to come
[44:54] mow your lawn. I don't need to do We're
[44:56] good. We're I know you took care of me,
[44:58] but uh what you did for me, you did did
[45:02] unto God. So just consider it that way
[45:05] and we're we're good. and honorth not
[45:07] father or mother, he shall be free. Thus
[45:11] ye have or thus have ye made the
[45:14] commandment of God of none effect by
[45:17] your tradition. Ye hypocrites. Well did
[45:20] Isaiah's prophesy of you, saying, "This
[45:23] people draw nigh unto me with their
[45:25] mouth, and honorth me with their lips,
[45:28] but their heart is far from me." But in
[45:30] vain they do worship me, teaching for
[45:32] doctrines the commandments of men. And
[45:35] he called the multitude, and said unto
[45:36] the him, unto them, "Hear and
[45:38] understand. Not that which goeth into
[45:42] the mouth defileth a man, but that which
[45:44] cometh out of the mouth, this defileleth
[45:46] man." Then said his disciples unto him,
[45:49] "Knowest thou not that the Pharisees
[45:50] were offended after they heard this,
[45:53] saying?" Like, do you know what you're
[45:55] doing here? You're making those guys
[45:59] mad.
[46:00] But he answered and said,"Every plant
[46:03] which my heavenly Father hath not
[46:05] planted shall be rooted up. Let them
[46:08] alone. They will be blind leaders of the
[46:10] blind. And if the blind lead the blind,
[46:12] both shall fall into the ditch." Then
[46:14] answered Peter and said unto him,
[46:16] "Declare under this unto us this
[46:18] parable." Jesus said, "Ye also yet
[46:23] without understanding, do you not
[46:25] understand that whatsoever enterth into
[46:29] the mouth goeth out of the belly, and is
[46:31] cast out into the drought? But those
[46:33] things which proceedth out of the mouth
[46:36] come from the heart, and they defile the
[46:39] man. For out of the heart proceedth evil
[46:42] thoughts, murderers, adulteries,
[46:44] fornications, thefts, false witnesses,
[46:47] blasphemies. These are the things which
[46:49] defile a man, but to eat with unwashed
[46:53] hands defileth not a man. Heavenly
[46:56] Father, I just ask in your word, Lord,
[46:59] that we would see how our hearts,
[47:02] Father, are the critical matter, Lord,
[47:05] and just break your word to us as we
[47:08] commit it to you. In Jesus name we pray.
[47:10] Amen. You could be seated. The thought I
[47:12] would like to take with you and we'll
[47:15] just fellowship on is the character of
[47:17] the heart. So when we talk about the
[47:19] character of something, it's the
[47:21] characteristics. It's the nature and
[47:25] it's it's by which you know something.
[47:27] It's it's its characteristics. You know,
[47:30] if it looks like a duck, sounds like a
[47:32] duck, walks like a duck, it might be a
[47:36] horse, right?
[47:38] It's a duck, right? So by its
[47:40] characteristics you know something and
[47:43] this is a this is very fundamental this
[47:46] is elementary everybody here from the
[47:48] youngest to the oldest should be able to
[47:50] understand the if it's character
[47:53] declares something that's it's it's
[47:57] telling you what it is right so Jesus
[47:59] says look every tree that my father
[48:01] hasn't planted it's going to be burned
[48:04] &gt;&gt; all right so we can know that with an
[48:06] assurity if it's not of God if it's not
[48:08] planted of God. If it's not from God,
[48:11] its end is to be burned. And we say,
[48:14] "Praise the Lord." Because we don't want
[48:16] anything that's left over of man. We
[48:18] don't want anything that I'm so glad
[48:21] that all the things of man has an assure
[48:24] ending and that's to be burned. So I we
[48:27] rejoice in this, but there's an
[48:30] understanding that we want to have
[48:33] that the heart becomes a very critical
[48:37] thing.
[48:39] Right? Because it's from the heart that
[48:41] the issues of life happen. It's from the
[48:44] heart. Jesus is is saying, "Look, you're
[48:46] looking at the hands and the behavior,
[48:49] but you're you're you're not even
[48:51] understanding the condition of the heart
[48:52] and my prayer." And and just even as I'm
[48:55] this word, it's convicting to me. I have
[48:58] to know my heart's condition.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; I have to be very aware of the
[49:02] characteristics and the nature that my
[49:04] heart is declaring.
[49:07] And it's it's not hid, right? I my heart
[49:11] declares itself in my behavior, the
[49:13] things I do, the things I put my
[49:15] affections on, the way I spend my time.
[49:17] And if I if I don't take heed to myself,
[49:20] then I become a Pharisee and a Sadducee
[49:24] where I've whitened the walls. I've
[49:26] given myself this image of religion. I
[49:28] profess with my mouth that I care for
[49:30] the things of God. And on the very
[49:32] inside, my heart
[49:36] is not
[49:38] knit with his.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; And I and I would challenge us as we
[49:44] look at we look at the character of the
[49:46] heart. My question would be, is your
[49:49] heart's condition
[49:51] mirroring the heart of Christ?
[49:55] And that's just the the way the Lord was
[49:57] convicting me. But we're going to step
[49:58] through this. A lot of what we were just
[50:01] the Lord led was just through the
[50:03] different services. our f our pastor
[50:05] talking about uh character and the way
[50:08] back and and you know the the uh the
[50:12] amnesia and our brother Cosman. It was
[50:14] just a wonderful time in the Lord and
[50:16] the the Lord just continued to feed us.
[50:18] We're going to take some some uh quotes
[50:20] out of believing from the heart. Brother
[50:23] Brandham would say uh I've noticed the
[50:27] these things. I noticed them. I come to
[50:30] the conclusion, no matter what you are,
[50:33] God has to furnish the audience, no
[50:35] matter if it if I could stand this
[50:38] morning and bring the dead to life and
[50:40] bring the cripples to the normal
[50:42] condition. And yet, if God is not in the
[50:45] program, it would be in vain,
[50:47] &gt;&gt; right? So, I I want to tell you the good
[50:50] news is that we're not dependent on on
[50:53] my ability or even the things that I
[50:55] would do. What really comes down to it
[50:57] is is we want to recognize whether or
[50:59] not God's in it, right? And if if if
[51:02] God's in it, then I want allin.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; I if God's a part if the program is
[51:07] God's program, then I want to be
[51:09] passionate about it. I want to be
[51:12] dedicated to it. I want to understand
[51:14] what the mind and the will of God is.
[51:15] And I want all
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be the one who's sitting
[51:18] back going, "Could this be? I don't know
[51:21] enough. I have no spiritual discernment
[51:23] enough to know. I don't know my Bible
[51:25] enough to know. I don't even know why
[51:27] I'm here. I don't even understand if
[51:29] this is God's program. I'm halted
[51:31] between two opinions. As brother Matthew
[51:33] said the other night, it's just not my
[51:35] style. So, I can't discern if it's God
[51:39] or not because it hasn't petted my flesh
[51:42] the way I like it. I have no
[51:44] understanding of whether or not it's the
[51:46] word of God or not. But we know if it
[51:49] the reward of this day is to know the
[51:52] very mind and heart of God. When you've
[51:55] received this message of this day,
[51:56] you've been given access to the very
[51:58] heart and mind of Jesus Christ. That is
[52:02] what you have the ability to know. You
[52:04] have no excuse to not know and
[52:06] understand that God desired for you to
[52:08] be here tonight.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; You you pleased the very heart of God by
[52:13] not forsaking to bring yourselves
[52:15] together and assemble yourselves and and
[52:17] to be mindful of the needs and the
[52:19] burdens of the others and say, "You know
[52:20] what? I'm going to go show whose side
[52:22] I'm on. I'm going to bring my lick of
[52:24] fire. I'm going to come to the house of
[52:26] the Lord and I'm going to be believing
[52:28] for the my brothers and sisters, Lord,
[52:30] that you could come and in your word and
[52:32] you could do something. That's the mind
[52:34] of God.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; That's the heart of God to you.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; We're going to try to move along.
[52:40] [clears throat]
[52:42] Man is known by his characteristics.
[52:48] If you take a man, no matter how good he
[52:50] tries to be, if his works are evil, all
[52:53] the goodness won't amount to nothing. So
[52:57] there's a we're talking about the heart
[52:59] condition. And if a man's word is his
[53:01] character, a man has the word is a man,
[53:05] his word is no good, then you'll never
[53:07] have confidence in that man because his
[53:09] word is no good.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; So now we're talking about character,
[53:12] right? So therefore, God our father, his
[53:16] character and his works prove what he
[53:18] is. Now we know that the world come here
[53:24] by some great creator. It could not have
[53:28] just happened to be. Now I want to just
[53:30] a few moments to just as simple as
[53:32] possible, but I want you to get in
[53:35] praying that the Holy Spirit would move
[53:37] it right into the light that it belongs
[53:39] in. Now, if you would just look and see
[53:42] the trees growing and the limbs and the
[53:45] leaves, how they come and go, the
[53:47] flowers in the spring and the fall and
[53:48] the winter and the summer, something has
[53:50] got to be behind it. There could not be
[53:53] a tree unless there could be an
[53:54] intelligence to make a tree. No matter
[53:56] what kind of life it would be, there has
[53:59] to be behind that an intelligence makes
[54:02] it what it is. Now, he's he's touching
[54:06] on something. The intelligence behind it
[54:10] makes it what it is. It's very simple,
[54:14] but the tree wouldn't be doing anything
[54:16] unless there was a life in it.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So, ye are the vine. I'm the
[54:21] vine. You're the branches. There's a
[54:23] there's going to be a a a concept here
[54:25] we want to understand. Now, think that
[54:27] straight now. Don't let it go over.
[54:30] Think of it deep. For if you notice our
[54:32] scripture lesson, Jesus said, "If you
[54:34] will say, if you say in your heart," so
[54:36] brother Brandon had taken a text. He
[54:38] took a text from uh Mark 16:14 after he
[54:41] appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me
[54:43] and araided them with their unbelief and
[54:46] hardness of their heart because they
[54:48] believed not them which had seen him
[54:52] after he had risen. So, Brother
[54:54] Brandham's takes two scriptures. He
[54:56] takes the one where he's araiding the
[54:58] 11. Now these are disciples but look at
[55:01] the heart condition that they had the
[55:03] heart he he he has he has now indicted
[55:06] them for the hardness of their heart. I
[55:09] don't think any of us would go ahead and
[55:11] say in our own esteem in our own I you
[55:13] know none of us have paid the price of
[55:15] the apostles we haven't done anything
[55:17] unto death because I still see you.
[55:20] Okay. But he's telling them that the
[55:22] ones that were with Jesus,
[55:25] he's now telling them, "Your heart
[55:27] condition didn't allow you to receive
[55:30] the testimony
[55:31] of others that had witnessed me."
[55:36] It was a heart condition. So, there's a
[55:38] there was a a hardness of their heart.
[55:41] The good news is is he also took Mark
[55:43] 11:23. He said,"For verily I say unto
[55:46] you, that whatsoever shall say unto this
[55:49] mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
[55:52] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[55:54] in his heart," that's Mark 11:23, "He
[55:58] shall believe that those things which he
[56:00] saith shall come to pass, and he shall
[56:03] have whatsoever he saith."
[56:06] &gt;&gt; So now, what's important?
[56:09] &gt;&gt; The heart. and and it just the title of
[56:13] the sermon, man, it just hits me.
[56:15] Believe from the heart. You know, a lot
[56:17] of us think we believe and we think and
[56:19] it's the, you know, it's the head. But
[56:22] he he's saying if you doubt in your
[56:23] heart
[56:24] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham takes that the
[56:26] other way and he says if you believe in
[56:28] your heart
[56:29] &gt;&gt; you know Jesus said if you don't doubt
[56:31] &gt;&gt; but you believe you can in in your heart
[56:33] but now recognize that your belief
[56:37] your heart what it does is going to
[56:40] result in really what fountain what
[56:43] fruit what tree what life
[56:45] &gt;&gt; is in the tree
[56:47] &gt;&gt; because the tree has to have an
[56:48] intelligence behind it.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; You are bearing a fruit.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Your life, your characteristics, what is
[56:57] coming to manifestation
[57:00] is because of your heart.
[57:04] Now,
[57:05] we're going to take a deep exam. He
[57:07] said, "Stop. Dig deep. Don't let that go
[57:10] over your head." So, we're going to look
[57:11] at, you know, the heart is
[57:15] a muscle.
[57:17] It has chambers.
[57:19] It pulsates and all of you can live
[57:21] without it.
[57:24] All right, we got you paying attention.
[57:28] You can't live without your heart. And
[57:30] and just to make this relatable really u
[57:33] could you imagine two friends who didn't
[57:36] have anything in common
[57:40] that their hearts didn't even have the
[57:43] same interest.
[57:45] It just that it would be like a body
[57:48] without a heart. there would be no life
[57:49] be in that friendship. Right? So what
[57:52] what you have to understand is uh when
[57:55] we're talking about these issues of life
[57:57] there we we relate to them in material
[58:00] things but there's a real spiritual
[58:02] aspect to it. It's the life flow, right?
[58:06] The heart is the life flow. What's
[58:10] keeping you going?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; What's your source of strength?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes things strong.
[58:17] Yes, sir.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Jeremiah 17:9, we're going to
[58:22] go through some scriptures. We're going
[58:23] to try to uh I don't think we'll be
[58:25] long. Jeremiah 17:9, the heart is a
[58:28] deceitful above all things and
[58:31] desperately wicked. Who can know it?
[58:35] &gt;&gt; So, ouch.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; So, David, you're telling me that you
[58:40] just said the heart's very important. I
[58:42] need the heart. Without the heart, I
[58:44] die. And now you're telling me it's
[58:46] deceitful.
[58:48] It's desperately wicked. And who can
[58:50] know it? Yes. That is your born
[58:53] condition.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; This is your born condition. You can't
[58:58] you can't appease this.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; You can't make this white. You can't
[59:02] cover it up. I It You will find until
[59:06] you're born again, things just happen
[59:09] that come from this guy right here. And
[59:11] it has no good fruit. It's selfish.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; It's you're you're indicted.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; You you that brother Brandham says it in
[59:22] one one place and a brother shared it
[59:24] while he was here. Uh but your
[59:28] righteousness
[59:29] is filthy.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; So the best that you can do is coming
[59:34] from this place. Proverbs 2:12, every
[59:37] way of a man is right in his own eyes,
[59:39] but the Lord ponderth the hearts. So
[59:42] even your own understanding, your
[59:44] thinking of your heart would be that
[59:46] you're right. But God's judging that.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; First Corinthians 11:28, "But let a man
[59:52] examine himself and so let him eat of
[59:55] that bread and drink of that cup."
[59:57] &gt;&gt; I mean, are you making sure your hands
[59:59] are clean?
[1:00:02] Are you or was it like, "I'm going to
[1:00:03] take a piece of bread off the plate and
[1:00:06] I just need to make sure my hands are
[1:00:08] clean." That's not the examination.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Right. But for this cause many are sick
[1:00:13] and weakly among you, not discerning the
[1:00:15] Lord's body. What are we to discern?
[1:00:17] What are we to take an account of? What
[1:00:18] are we supposed to examine? We want to
[1:00:21] be looking at our heart.
[1:00:25] Isaiah 29:13, "Wherefore the Lord
[1:00:28] said,"For as much as the people draw
[1:00:30] near me with their mouths, and with
[1:00:33] their lips do honor me, but have removed
[1:00:36] their heart far from me,
[1:00:39] and their fear towards me is taught by
[1:00:41] the precept of man."
[1:00:44] I mean, what a what a condition.
[1:00:47] Now, we love the Lord, Jehovah,
[1:00:51] deliverer, brought us out of Egypt. what
[1:00:53] mighty things he's done. And now their
[1:00:56] hearts are so far from them that yet
[1:01:00] while their mouths are giving accolades
[1:01:02] and they're going through this form of
[1:01:04] worship, they really don't care for the
[1:01:07] things that God cares about.
[1:01:10] It's written all over their face. It's
[1:01:12] written all over by the things that they
[1:01:14] do. They don't have the nature and the
[1:01:16] love of Christ in their life. They are
[1:01:18] not showing forth who God is. But they
[1:01:20] sure got a mouth service. But their
[1:01:23] their hearts had wandered.
[1:01:26] Jesus would say, "Ye hypocrites.
[1:01:30] Well did Isaiah's prophesy of you,
[1:01:32] saying, these people draweth none to me
[1:01:34] with their mouth, and honorth me with
[1:01:35] their lips, but their heart is far from
[1:01:37] me, but in vain they do worship me,
[1:01:40] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:01:41] of men." So this is a longunning
[1:01:46] condition.
[1:01:48] Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[1:01:50] hypocrites, for you clean the outside of
[1:01:52] the cup of the platter, and with and
[1:01:55] within they are full of extortion and
[1:01:58] excess. Thou bind fer blind Pharisees.
[1:02:02] Cleanse first that which is within the
[1:02:04] cup and the platter, that the outside of
[1:02:07] them may be clean. Also, woe unto you
[1:02:10] Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye like unto
[1:02:12] the whited separators, and indeed appear
[1:02:15] beautiful outwardly, but are within full
[1:02:18] of dead men's bones, and all
[1:02:21] uncleansliness.
[1:02:23] Even so, ye also outwardly appear
[1:02:25] righteous unto men, but within ye are
[1:02:29] full of hypocrisy and iniquity. So, the
[1:02:32] word now has come two-edged.
[1:02:35] Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; It's it's two-edged.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; You could on the outside
[1:02:41] portray the righteousness,
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; but if your heart is wrong,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; it was for nothing.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; But if your heart's right,
[1:02:52] you are going to show forth the
[1:02:54] righteousness.
[1:02:55] And we'll get into that.
[1:02:58] But you know, you can have a form of
[1:03:00] godliness, but deny the power of it.
[1:03:02] Right? Titus puts it this way. This is
[1:03:04] very good. I'm going to also take it out
[1:03:06] of the amplified.
[1:03:07] They profess that they know God, but in
[1:03:10] works they deny him, being abominable,
[1:03:14] disobedient, and to every good work
[1:03:17] reprobate. Would you like So, it's a
[1:03:20] broken and contrite spirit. Right?
[1:03:25] So, Titus 1:16,
[1:03:28] they pro it in amplified and I believe
[1:03:31] we have it. You can read it with me.
[1:03:33] They profess to know God, to recognize,
[1:03:36] perceive, and to be acquainted with him,
[1:03:39] but deny and disown and renounce him by
[1:03:42] what they do.
[1:03:45] It's the little tab that says AMPC.
[1:03:52] They profess to know God, to recognize,
[1:03:55] perceive, and to be acquainted with him,
[1:03:57] but deny and disown and renounce him by
[1:04:00] what they do.
[1:04:02] They are detestable and loathome,
[1:04:06] unbelieving and disobedient and disloyal
[1:04:09] and rebellious. And they are unfit and
[1:04:12] worthless for good work, deed or
[1:04:14] enterprise of any kind.
[1:04:18] Now they have a profession,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:25] I know the message.
[1:04:27] I know God sent a prophet,
[1:04:30] but
[1:04:33] they denounce him by what they do.
[1:04:38] So when the message says do and do not
[1:04:41] do and you don't do,
[1:04:45] then you're renouncing.
[1:04:47] I don't care what you say.
[1:04:50] When the message teaches something and
[1:04:52] you live contrary to it, then you by
[1:04:55] your deeds are renouncing by your deeds.
[1:05:01] Right? So we we it's not we're not left
[1:05:03] out of this. We're not a religion where
[1:05:05] we've now drawn an affiliation. We think
[1:05:07] if I profess him before man, I'm now per
[1:05:10] but he's looking at the very works that
[1:05:12] you have and your heart. So you you it's
[1:05:16] you have to have both.
[1:05:18] And in one place where brother Brandon
[1:05:20] would even say that he knew Balam's
[1:05:22] heart, right, wasn't the will of God.
[1:05:25] That he would he wanted his own desire
[1:05:27] over the word of God. So your I and this
[1:05:31] is the good news. The character of the
[1:05:32] heart of the believer is that their
[1:05:35] heart desires God's will over their own
[1:05:39] will. you the heritage that we have, the
[1:05:42] restoration that we've been given and
[1:05:45] and we're we're just holding back. We're
[1:05:46] not going to leave you here. We're we're
[1:05:48] going to get there. But you have the
[1:05:50] heart of Christ.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You have the heart that says, "Not my
[1:05:54] will, but thine will be done." But you
[1:05:57] have to recognize that there is a
[1:05:59] transformation. There's a place where
[1:06:01] the heart deceives itself that thinks
[1:06:04] because it could take a form of
[1:06:05] godliness, that it could take a
[1:06:07] profession, that it can take a religious
[1:06:09] works, it can dress itself up, but
[1:06:11] inwardly it's ravenous.
[1:06:14] I if you think in your own way that
[1:06:18] you've attained something,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; it's religion.
[1:06:24] And even then, so if you can put on
[1:06:27] religion and you don't know the very
[1:06:30] mind and will of God, you've missed it.
[1:06:35] There's a place, now this is the good
[1:06:37] news. There's a place where a man can
[1:06:40] live so close to the presence of God.
[1:06:43] It's not by your choosing.
[1:06:46] Brother Brandham says it's not by your
[1:06:49] choosing. So, I want to live close, so
[1:06:52] close to the presence of God. And it's
[1:06:54] not by my choosing.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; It's by God's election
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; that you live in that spot to where your
[1:07:01] own intellectuals have nothing to do
[1:07:03] with it.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; I I I have a peace now. The place that
[1:07:09] I'm living so close to him that the
[1:07:12] devil don't know to to do with me is
[1:07:14] because of his elective love and grace.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:07:19] This is the place we want to be where
[1:07:21] Mark 11:23, for verily I say unto you,
[1:07:24] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:07:26] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[1:07:28] cast into the sea, and shall not doubt
[1:07:31] in his heart, he shall believe those
[1:07:34] things that he saith shall come to pass.
[1:07:37] He shall have whatsoever he saith.
[1:07:40] Brother Brandham is talking about that
[1:07:42] place. He testifies to the fishy. He
[1:07:45] testifies of the things that God did. He
[1:07:48] says, "I had nothing to do with it."
[1:07:50] That was a channel
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; where the very life of Christ now drops
[1:07:54] in and the very words that he's speaking
[1:07:56] is coming through a life source
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; that is not him.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go through some things. I'm
[1:08:07] going to just establish a basis here
[1:08:09] because power apart from character is
[1:08:11] satanic,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; right? We're not just we're not just
[1:08:15] craving this. Hey, I see. Let me buy
[1:08:17] this from you. I see the devils are
[1:08:19] subject to you. I want to be able to
[1:08:20] speak the word, right? I want to be able
[1:08:23] to to have this power, but this is the
[1:08:26] gate that you have to enter in. If you
[1:08:29] love me, keep my commandments. He that
[1:08:32] hath my commandments and keepeth them,
[1:08:34] he is he that loveth me. And he that
[1:08:36] loveth me shall be loved by my father,
[1:08:38] and I will love him, and will manifest
[1:08:41] myself to him. For this is the love of
[1:08:44] God that you keep his commandments and
[1:08:47] his commandments are not grievious.
[1:08:49] That's three scriptures. And this is
[1:08:51] love that we walk after his
[1:08:54] commandments. This is the commandment
[1:08:56] that as ye have heard from the
[1:08:58] beginning, ye should walk in it.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; If you keep my commandments, ye shall
[1:09:03] abide in my love. Even as I have kept my
[1:09:06] father's commandments, abide in his
[1:09:08] love. That was John 14:15, 14:21, 1 John
[1:09:13] 5:3, 2 John 1:6,
[1:09:16] John 15:10, 1 John 4:20.
[1:09:20] It's a principle that's very well
[1:09:22] taught. If you love God, keep his
[1:09:25] commandments.
[1:09:26] And we all know we love from the mind.
[1:09:31] If a man say, "I love God and ha and
[1:09:33] hateth his brother." Now, this is that
[1:09:35] outward show, right? So now we're
[1:09:37] talking about the character. If a man
[1:09:40] saith he loved God and hateth his
[1:09:42] brother, he is a liar. For he hath not,
[1:09:46] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:09:49] he hath seen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; How can he love God whom he hath not
[1:09:54] seen? And this commandment have we from
[1:09:56] him, that he who loveth God loveth his
[1:10:00] brother also. Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Saints,
[1:10:04] if we can understand, we're with the
[1:10:07] love that God loved us.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; It's for God so loved the world. Now,
[1:10:12] he's saying your brother whom you've
[1:10:14] seen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Right? So, I I I have to share with you
[1:10:19] this. You are the image of God.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; If I look upon the what God created in
[1:10:26] his image and I hate it,
[1:10:32] I mean, that right there should kill
[1:10:34] racism probably, right? I mean, I hate
[1:10:38] that. That would even be a thing. But if
[1:10:40] you can hate something made in the image
[1:10:42] of God, then the love of God is not in
[1:10:44] you.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you say
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; because we're made in his image. Why do
[1:10:51] you think Satan is such a perverter?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Why do you think he attacks what a man
[1:10:56] is and what a woman is? And because it's
[1:10:58] declaring who God is,
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; that's why he hates it.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; We man wasn't made to be that way.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; A woman wasn't made to be that way.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; And when we could recognize the image of
[1:11:11] God that we're made in, that's what
[1:11:13] causes the love of God to project.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; It's not Satan's image. He's a
[1:11:22] perverter.
[1:11:24] But what we love is when we can see
[1:11:26] through the eyes of Christ what God
[1:11:28] intended.
[1:11:32] Now just to kind of turn a corner a
[1:11:35] little bit we want to talk about
[1:11:40] the seed the fruit what is coming
[1:11:43] through that life. Brother Brandham even
[1:11:45] when he started he talked about the
[1:11:46] tree. So this is uh from the church
[1:11:49] ages. He says I know thy works. There
[1:11:53] are identical words uttered to each of
[1:11:54] the seven messengers relative to the
[1:11:56] people of God in each age. As they are
[1:11:59] spoken to the two vines, true and false,
[1:12:02] they will bring joy and gladness to the
[1:12:05] hearts of one group, but they ought to
[1:12:07] strike fear in the hearts of the other.
[1:12:09] For though we are saved by grace apart
[1:12:12] from works, true salvation will bring
[1:12:14] forth works or deeds that will please
[1:12:18] God. Now, this is the theme that's
[1:12:21] speaking to my heart is what pleases
[1:12:23] God,
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; right? It's it's the works that please
[1:12:28] God. We want God in it.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So, the the motivation here, the heart's
[1:12:32] desire, the really live stream of this
[1:12:35] is the pleasing of God.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; So, we're bringing forth now fruits,
[1:12:41] righteousness,
[1:12:43] even as he is righteous. If the verse
[1:12:45] means anything at all, it means that a
[1:12:47] man does, he is. As a man, what a man
[1:12:51] does, he is. James 3:11, "Do the
[1:12:55] fountain send forth as the same place,
[1:12:57] sweet water, and bitter?" Romans 6:2,
[1:13:00] "How shall we that are dead to sin live
[1:13:03] any longer therein?" Matthew 12:33-35.
[1:13:07] Either make the tree good and his fruit
[1:13:10] good, or else make the tree corrupt and
[1:13:12] his fruit corrupt. For the tree is known
[1:13:15] by his fruit. Oh generation of vipers,
[1:13:18] how ye being evil speak good things? For
[1:13:21] out of the abundance of the heart the
[1:13:22] mouth speaketh. A good man out of the
[1:13:25] treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:13:27] good things.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; A good man out of the treasure of his
[1:13:32] heart bringeth forth good things.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; What is the character of your heart?
[1:13:39] Because a good man
[1:13:41] out of the treasure of his heart
[1:13:44] bringeth forth good things.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; We have been made to possess good things
[1:13:49] in earthn vessels. The very life of
[1:13:52] Christ
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is what we have. It
[1:14:00] bringeth forth.
[1:14:02] Now if a man a good man out of the good
[1:14:05] treasures of his heart bringeth forth
[1:14:07] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:14:09] evil treasures forth uh bringeth forth
[1:14:11] evil things. Now if a man is born of the
[1:14:15] word being born again not of corruptible
[1:14:18] seed but of incorruptible
[1:14:21] by the word of God which liveth and
[1:14:24] abideth forever. He will produce the
[1:14:26] word and therefore will be scriptural.
[1:14:30] Oh, what an indictment the truth is
[1:14:32] going to be against the perig per p per
[1:14:35] p per p per p per p per p per p per p
[1:14:35] per p per p perimeamian church age the
[1:14:38] that stand that matchless one in his
[1:14:41] hand the shape of a sword with the two
[1:14:43] edges the word of god and that word will
[1:14:46] judge us on the last day in fact the
[1:14:48] word is judging even now
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; we what we've received is a word of god
[1:14:54] in this day that is judging us now as
[1:14:57] the bride of Jesus Christ we don't enter
[1:14:59] into a judgment to come. But we have a a
[1:15:02] word that is washing us now. It is
[1:15:04] judging us. It is coming. It is
[1:15:06] indicting the matter. It's telling us
[1:15:08] our hearts and the affections that it
[1:15:10] that could be attached to it need to be
[1:15:13] cut away.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Because we have to bring forth Christ.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; We don't have another option.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Our hearts must bring forth the Christ
[1:15:22] child. We have to declare Christ.
[1:15:25] There's not another place that it's
[1:15:27] going to take place.
[1:15:28] There's not another one. It's you or
[1:15:30] nothing.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; It's the bride of Jesus Christ declaring
[1:15:33] who Christ is from her heart or there's
[1:15:35] no one going to do it.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And it's given. This is the age. This is
[1:15:42] the hour.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is the season.
[1:15:47] It's been for such a time as this.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It there's no option.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; You're the tree is either good or it's
[1:15:55] bad. You're either going to produce the
[1:15:58] mature fruit for this day or you're not.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be in anticipation and
[1:16:06] expectation. We have to be looking. We
[1:16:08] have to be desiring. We have to be
[1:16:10] saying, "Lord, I want the very nature
[1:16:12] and character of Christ dealt out in my
[1:16:15] life.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing less."
[1:16:23] our character. We want him to be known.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] Just skipping through for the sake of
[1:16:33] time, but I want to read this.
[1:16:40] And any man, I'm going to back up just a
[1:16:42] little bit.
[1:16:45] Well, it seems like then upon thinking
[1:16:47] those things that there could be a
[1:16:49] placing by reading the word of faith
[1:16:51] that would go beyond the intellectual
[1:16:53] conceptions into the heart. Jesus said,
[1:16:56] "If thou sayest in thy heart now, we get
[1:16:59] all flustered in our minds and we go out
[1:17:02] and say, "Oh, I seen that done." Yes.
[1:17:05] And once in a while, I just hop, skip,
[1:17:08] and so forth. So, he's talking about
[1:17:10] just not really hitting the beat. You
[1:17:13] know, it's sometimes I'm up. It almost
[1:17:15] be like an up and down. Sometimes I'm
[1:17:16] running at it. Sometimes I, you know,
[1:17:18] sometimes things go good, sometimes they
[1:17:20] don't. And it seems like I just can't
[1:17:23] get moving right. It's because we try to
[1:17:25] mix the intellectual with the
[1:17:27] supernatural. They have no dealings with
[1:17:29] each other at all. Intellectuals will
[1:17:32] say one thing and the supernatural will
[1:17:34] say another. And any man that is ever
[1:17:36] led by the spirit of God does not take
[1:17:39] any thought of any intellectual, but he
[1:17:41] is led by from his heart by the spirit
[1:17:45] of God.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Your heart,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; what it has is the very spirit of Christ
[1:17:53] in it.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And we need to trust that. Not the
[1:17:58] deceitful heart,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; not this other heart,
[1:18:03] but something has transpired
[1:18:06] in a in a people.
[1:18:11] Now, Brother Brandham goes on and he
[1:18:13] makes this relatable. He says, "Right
[1:18:14] now, I have letters and phone calls. You
[1:18:16] mean, Brother Brandham, that you would
[1:18:18] wouldn't be going overseas after all
[1:18:21] this great, but it looks wonderful.
[1:18:24] Something way down inside said, be
[1:18:26] careful." So, brother Bram saying, you
[1:18:28] know, in his heart, he wants to do
[1:18:29] what's right. He wants to go. This is a
[1:18:32] great opportunity. This is the move of
[1:18:34] God. This is this is God moving. But
[1:18:36] something in his heart saying, "Be
[1:18:37] careful." And therefore, we don't look
[1:18:40] at what we see. We look at those things
[1:18:42] which we do not see. What God says in
[1:18:46] the heart.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand,
[1:18:51] we have to have our hearts tuned. Yes
[1:18:54] sir.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; We have to have our hearts in a
[1:18:57] condition to know the will of God.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; And in this day and in this hour,
[1:19:03] spiritual amnesia
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; is a plague.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; You are given to know the mind and heart
[1:19:11] of God. We've received a word in this
[1:19:15] day to tell you what the mind of heart
[1:19:17] and heart of God is.
[1:19:29] The heart's that channel.
[1:19:32] The character of your heart really has a
[1:19:35] lot to do with how effective that
[1:19:37] channel is,
[1:19:41] right? Because Jesus would pray in the
[1:19:43] garden, not my will, but thine be done.
[1:19:46] There's the sacrificial nature of your
[1:19:49] heart that has to be able to lay down
[1:19:51] its own wants and its own desires to
[1:19:54] display the true character of who Christ
[1:19:56] is.
[1:20:00] So there's the deceitful heart,
[1:20:02] there's the there, you know, it really
[1:20:05] that where's the greatest battle ever
[1:20:06] fought,
[1:20:08] right? It's taking place over your
[1:20:11] affections.
[1:20:13] It's taking place and you should be so
[1:20:15] thankful when the word of God comes and
[1:20:17] indictes you
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; and tells you that something isn't right
[1:20:20] in your heart.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God to you.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's I don't I don't want to have a
[1:20:28] heart that's displeasing to him.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Saints, I want the word to come. If we
[1:20:33] become so dull of hearing that when
[1:20:35] something's said in correction or said
[1:20:37] what's right or someone just says
[1:20:39] something, we can't see the truth in it.
[1:20:41] We just become defensive.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; We're just more interested in our
[1:20:46] self-image and our own pride.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; We can't even know that that person
[1:20:51] probably said that because it's the very
[1:20:53] heartbeat of God.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; We get more offended by the way it was
[1:20:57] brought.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't. The donkeyy's
[1:21:02] telling you no, and you're like,
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; I got my way.
[1:21:11] heart condition.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; You got a heart problem
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; and and it's okay. You were born that
[1:21:18] way.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You must be born again.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; You have to die.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Boy, dying ain't easy.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But God, now
[1:21:33] the way of God was to declare himself in
[1:21:35] you.
[1:21:38] Okay? So when we're talking about a
[1:21:40] tree, we're talking about a nature
[1:21:42] behind it. God's desire is that you be
[1:21:45] fruitful and you multiply and that you
[1:21:48] bring forth much fruit.
[1:21:52] That's his desire of you. That's the
[1:21:56] heart of God. That's the mind of God.
[1:21:58] That's the intelligence behind it. That
[1:22:01] is what's pushing for manifestation.
[1:22:03] That's why there's a struggle
[1:22:07] because that life has to be manifested.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; That's the intelligence behind it.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And
[1:22:18] now character,
[1:22:21] how's his character displayed?
[1:22:24] By a bed of ease.
[1:22:26] Where we I mean, let's be honest. Let's
[1:22:29] look at the Bible and we say everybody
[1:22:30] in the Bible, even Daniel, they had
[1:22:32] everything perfect. They were above
[1:22:35] reproach and they were just I mean Job,
[1:22:38] I mean everybody that I could think of
[1:22:41] in the Bible when they showed forth the
[1:22:43] glory of God, they were just maybe
[1:22:46] Solomon was, you know, he was pretty
[1:22:48] good actually. He had faults though,
[1:22:50] right? But there there is an
[1:22:53] understanding that God is proven. His
[1:22:56] character is tested. what he does must
[1:23:00] stand the test. Every son of God that
[1:23:02] comes to God must be is is chasened of
[1:23:04] the Lord, right? Because he knows what
[1:23:07] you're made of.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; You don't know what you're made of,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; but there's a there's a life inside of
[1:23:13] you that's going to bring forth a fruit.
[1:23:15] And brother Brandham in this sermon
[1:23:16] would talk about the guy who built the
[1:23:17] bridge. And he he said that there was a
[1:23:20] he he he gets excited about it because
[1:23:22] he's saying this man in in his in his
[1:23:24] building of the bridge, he went and got
[1:23:25] the best he got the best engineers. He
[1:23:27] got the best concrete. He got the best
[1:23:29] of everything because he's going to
[1:23:31] build a bridge. And you have to
[1:23:32] understand, brother Cosman, God's got a
[1:23:35] record.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; He gets the best.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He ain't a second place God. He whatever
[1:23:42] category he was in, he's first place.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; He's got the record.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You're the best.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; What he's placed inside of you is
[1:23:53] overcoming power. It don't have a second
[1:23:56] place.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It's the best. And you know what? In
[1:24:00] proving it's the best, sometimes it's
[1:24:01] just got to get a lot of things out of
[1:24:03] the way.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; When you when he's setting the pillars
[1:24:06] for the bridge, he's throwing sand. He's
[1:24:08] using the blasters. He's But he's going
[1:24:09] to get down to the bedrock. And when it
[1:24:12] comes down to it, you go, I know my
[1:24:13] redeemer liveth.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I Lord, you've destroyed me. I have
[1:24:20] nothing left. But this I know.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; I know your love.
[1:24:28] Oh my, it's good to be on the potter's
[1:24:30] wheel.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And that is God's love towards you.
[1:24:37] Now
[1:24:42] just share this. This was a blessing to
[1:24:45] me. Like Jesus was a witness of God. He
[1:24:47] become so full of God till him and God
[1:24:50] was one. God dwelt in Christ reconciling
[1:24:52] the world to himself. The very
[1:24:55] expression a man's work declares his
[1:24:58] character. Christ was God's work. Christ
[1:25:02] declaring God's character. His feeling
[1:25:05] for the sick. His longing for saving
[1:25:07] souls till even he gave his own life.
[1:25:10] God's work. God's character was declared
[1:25:13] in Christ.
[1:25:15] And if you can just empty your own
[1:25:17] intellectual thoughts out and give God
[1:25:21] the right of way, he can declare his
[1:25:24] character through the work of you of
[1:25:26] your yielding.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I tell you, you can't give what you
[1:25:30] ain't got.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Your good will and your desire to do
[1:25:35] something for someone in all your
[1:25:37] efforts, you might as well be a Mother
[1:25:39] Teresa.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing could come of it. God's not in
[1:25:44] it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Nothing could come of it. But I've got
[1:25:47] news for you. If you could empty
[1:25:49] yourself out, if you could yield
[1:25:51] yourself enough, you say, "God, have the
[1:25:53] right of way.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, take this heart. Take this mind.
[1:25:57] Take my desires. It's yours.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Have the right of way.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Empty up. Get the word the world. Get
[1:26:11] your doubts out of the way. If you come
[1:26:14] to the altar to be prayed for, say,
[1:26:16] "I'll go up and I'll just get if I get
[1:26:19] healed." God can never declare his
[1:26:21] works. You've got to get your own
[1:26:23] thoughts out of the way and let him fill
[1:26:27] you.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; This is not a passive religion.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go see if God's God. We got
[1:26:35] a lot of people whose hearts are never
[1:26:37] in it.
[1:26:39] Their
[1:26:41] hearts aren't it.
[1:26:43] They never did.
[1:26:47] Now,
[1:26:49] this is the promise. Second Peter
[1:26:51] 1:4-12.
[1:26:58] We're just going to go through this.
[1:26:59] Whereby are ye given un whereby are
[1:27:04] given unto us exceeding great and
[1:27:07] precious promises, that by these ye
[1:27:10] might be partakers of divine nature,
[1:27:13] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:27:16] the world through lust. And besides
[1:27:18] this, so now
[1:27:21] you are partakers of divine. Don't let
[1:27:26] that word divine get lost.
[1:27:30] divine nature. You partakers of divine
[1:27:34] nature. You who were once alienated from
[1:27:37] God. You who had a deceitful heart, a
[1:27:40] heart that was was corrupted. How could
[1:27:43] this be? How could it be that you were
[1:27:46] made a partaker? And he goes on and he
[1:27:48] talks about the stature of a perfect
[1:27:50] man. He goes through and he lists the
[1:27:52] virtues.
[1:27:54] I think we're close to um do we have
[1:27:58] time? What time do we start?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you. All right. So, we'll we'll
[1:28:02] read it because it's good. It's God's
[1:28:04] word. Having escaped the corruption that
[1:28:06] is in the world through lust. And
[1:28:07] besides this, give all diligence. This
[1:28:10] is our part. Add to your faith virtue
[1:28:13] and to the virtue knowledge, and to the
[1:28:15] knowledge, temperance, and to temperance
[1:28:16] patience, and to patience, godliness,
[1:28:18] and to godliness brotherly kindness, and
[1:28:20] the brotherly kindness charity, love,
[1:28:22] the capstone. For if these things be in
[1:28:25] you and abound, they make you that you
[1:28:27] shall be neither barren nor unfruitful.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; So what's the intelligence behind the
[1:28:34] tree? What's the desire? It's that you
[1:28:37] be fruitful. How do we be fruitful? This
[1:28:41] is it's right here. There's a
[1:28:43] restoration to the bride tree. This is
[1:28:46] the things that were ate away through
[1:28:47] each church age, right? We know what
[1:28:49] this we have the way back. We have how
[1:28:53] to get rid of spiritual amnesia. We
[1:28:55] understand the very way that God combed
[1:28:58] these things and and how these were
[1:29:00] taken away from the church and how
[1:29:02] they're restored back. We live in the
[1:29:05] age where we can say we've been made
[1:29:07] partakers of divine nature. And if we're
[1:29:10] partakers of divine nature, then we are
[1:29:12] neither barren nor unfruitful.
[1:29:16] This is why this is possible. Ezekiel
[1:29:18] 36, for I will take from you among the
[1:29:22] heathen, and gather you out of the
[1:29:23] countries, and will bring you unto your
[1:29:26] own land. Then will I sprinkle clean
[1:29:29] water upon you, and ye shall be clean
[1:29:32] from all your filthiness, and from all
[1:29:33] your idols will I cleanse you. A new
[1:29:36] heart also will I give you, and a new
[1:29:38] spirit will I put within you. And I will
[1:29:40] take away the stony heart of your flesh.
[1:29:42] and I will give you a heart of flesh,
[1:29:44] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:29:46] cause you to walk into my statutes, and
[1:29:49] you shall keep my judgments and do them.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah. I couldn't keep them before.
[1:29:55] I couldn't do them before. I tried and I
[1:29:58] failed. Oh, but he took out my stony
[1:30:01] heart.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; He took out that heart of a David McGary
[1:30:04] Jr. Oh my.
[1:30:07] Oh, brother Brandham talks about that
[1:30:09] that that boy that was an Irish and
[1:30:11] German descent. And he says he had the
[1:30:13] genes. He said the parents are born
[1:30:16] again, but he was stuck with that
[1:30:17] nature. He says until he's born again,
[1:30:20] no. Oh, saints, you don't have to worry
[1:30:23] about how treacherous your heart is. I
[1:30:25] know the heart mener. I know the one who
[1:30:28] can take out the stony heart and give
[1:30:30] you a new heart. Are you willing to put
[1:30:32] your heart on his altar and say,
[1:30:33] "Consume it, Lord." Yeah.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you take your heart and
[1:30:37] you put it on his altar and I say,
[1:30:38] "Lord, even right now, the things that
[1:30:40] I've if I've lost my first love, if my
[1:30:43] heart has gone astray, if there's
[1:30:45] anything in my heart that's not messed
[1:30:46] with yours, Lord, give me a new heart."
[1:30:49] This is your attribute.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; You can't change.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Your word said you would do this. It
[1:30:55] didn't say I would do it.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; David McGary is going to go change his
[1:30:59] heart. He's a He's a good leopard
[1:31:02] licker. He'll take his spots right off.
[1:31:05] can't do it.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; I can't I can't change the nature of how
[1:31:10] deceitful and treacherous this heart is
[1:31:14] of a man. But he promised that he would
[1:31:17] give you a new heart and a new spirit.
[1:31:19] Why is it even possible that the tree
[1:31:22] could start bringing forth a good fruit?
[1:31:25] It ain't you.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; The redemption of Calvary is so
[1:31:30] profound.
[1:31:33] Well,
[1:31:36] what Calvary allowed you to partake in
[1:31:39] is the very nature of Jesus Christ. The
[1:31:42] nature that could cause him to go to the
[1:31:44] cross and say, "Father, forgive for they
[1:31:47] know not what they do." All of a sudden,
[1:31:49] you have a virtue in you.
[1:31:53] The nature of a lamb that could say,
[1:31:54] "Father, forgive."
[1:31:58] Oh, that's not my strength.
[1:32:02] That's because he's given me a new
[1:32:03] heart.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; That's a character that he wants on
[1:32:08] display.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He wants the nature of Christ on display
[1:32:12] that loves, forgives
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; what he was, Christ declared the heart
[1:32:19] of God.
[1:32:21] We get so lost in our religion that you
[1:32:24] don't we I wonder if we even understand
[1:32:27] what we look like,
[1:32:29] the way we treat other people,
[1:32:32] our thought processes towards other
[1:32:34] people.
[1:32:36] He died for the sins of the world. That
[1:32:39] person out there, Brother Brandon,
[1:32:42] walking into the diner was not
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; that wasn't a nice story.
[1:32:50] That was the heart of God.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; He paid for those sins. That's why you
[1:32:57] you're quick to put people under the
[1:32:59] blood because he paid that price. You
[1:33:02] forgive
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; because if you judge, you're judged.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; It's heart condition.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; When your heart is in a place where
[1:33:11] you're judging other people's, there's
[1:33:12] your heart's not you're not in tune.
[1:33:15] You're you're you're losing your you're
[1:33:18] not in that place of fellowship. You
[1:33:20] ought to be and we all can get there.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; It this is this is a checkup. This is
[1:33:24] examin. We have communion to examine
[1:33:27] ourselves. And the churches that don't
[1:33:29] have communion, they might not just be
[1:33:31] examining themselves. And it shows in
[1:33:33] the way they dress. They got worldliness
[1:33:35] all in the church. The makeup's back in.
[1:33:37] The d the short skirts are back in. And
[1:33:39] it's all in the name of the message.
[1:33:42] Worldly musics are being played in the
[1:33:44] church.
[1:33:46] [snorts]
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; In the church. I'm not saying during the
[1:33:49] service. I'm saying in the sanctuary in
[1:33:51] the house of God.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; They're playing music that ought not to
[1:33:54] be played,
[1:33:57] no examination,
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; no checkup of the heart condition. You
[1:34:01] ain't fooling God.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; If you love the world or the things of
[1:34:05] the world, the love of God is not even
[1:34:07] in you.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; You got to check up.
[1:34:16] character,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; character.
[1:34:21] You know, the the the ruggedness of a
[1:34:23] Christian in the in the life of a
[1:34:26] Christian. We don't sacrifice anything
[1:34:28] anymore.
[1:34:30] We don't give up anything.
[1:34:33] We are more selfish.
[1:34:36] And I'm must be preaching that myself.
[1:34:39] But
[1:34:41] the and when I say sacrifice, I'm not I
[1:34:44] don't have a Catholic idea of Ash
[1:34:46] Wednesday or you know like I'm going to
[1:34:47] give up chocolate for a week so I could
[1:34:49] show that I could sacrifice something.
[1:34:51] I'm talking about when do you lay
[1:34:53] yourself down for somebody else? When do
[1:34:55] you when they ask you to go a mile, do
[1:34:57] you go twain?
[1:34:59] When do you take the harder way?
[1:35:03] And if that isn't happening in our
[1:35:04] lives, it's not because there ain't a
[1:35:07] cross to bear. It's because we don't
[1:35:09] know the mind of Christ.
[1:35:21] This is what brother Brandham would say.
[1:35:23] His works cannot fail. His character
[1:35:25] cannot fail. And his works declare his
[1:35:27] character. And so he's arisen today, and
[1:35:29] he's here in our midst, the same
[1:35:30] yesterday, today, and forever. And we're
[1:35:33] witnesses of his character. His
[1:35:35] character has changed me. When it come
[1:35:38] to me, I was once a sinner and now I'm
[1:35:40] saved. I was once lost, now I'm found. I
[1:35:44] once loved the things of the world. I
[1:35:46] hate it now.
[1:35:54] Somebody saw me crying the other day and
[1:35:56] [laughter] they're like, "Why is Dave
[1:35:57] Jr. crying?" I appreciated brother
[1:35:59] Jeremy coming and talking about a vase
[1:36:01] that's broken. Saints, when I start
[1:36:04] thinking about where my heart was, I
[1:36:06] start crying about the grace of God in
[1:36:09] my life.
[1:36:10] I can't help it. If you if this is a
[1:36:13] crack in the vase for his glory that I'm
[1:36:16] just going to be a baller because when I
[1:36:18] start thinking about where I was,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I was an enemy to God.
[1:36:27] My heart was strayed from it. It's not
[1:36:29] that I didn't know the truth. I knew the
[1:36:31] truth and I was an enemy of the truth.
[1:36:36] Oh, but God rich in mercy. Oh, he
[1:36:39] reached down to me.
[1:36:43] And you [laughter] know what? I just got
[1:36:44] to thank him. When I think about I just
[1:36:47] got to tell him I love him.
[1:36:49] It wasn't me who did it. It was divine
[1:36:52] intervention.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; It was the grace of God. And you know
[1:36:56] what, Lord? I can't change for the way
[1:36:59] you brought me. I would have much rather
[1:37:01] been a good kid.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; I wish I would have I serve I see kids
[1:37:06] Oh, my heart rejoices.
[1:37:09] They love the Lord and the things of
[1:37:10] God. What a beautiful testimony. I'm
[1:37:13] more zealous for that testimony than the
[1:37:15] one I I [laughter] had. I wish I could
[1:37:18] tell I wished I could live the way you
[1:37:20] live.
[1:37:31] So, it's just a broken vase with some
[1:37:34] lines in it, a couple tears, but I tell
[1:37:38] you what, you stand in the glory of God,
[1:37:41] being proclaiming his grace of holiness
[1:37:43] and righteousness and overcoming
[1:37:47] and with a zeal for the love of God and
[1:37:48] for the things of God with a passion for
[1:37:51] God. Don't compromise.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; But he changed me.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; I once cared not for God.
[1:38:07] I love him now. Something happened to
[1:38:10] me. Something happened to you. What is
[1:38:12] it? It's God's work declaring his
[1:38:15] character.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:38:18] You're meant to declare the very
[1:38:20] character of who he is. That's
[1:38:22] restoration.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to wrap up here.
[1:38:30] This here, this is a dying spirit and a
[1:38:33] dying body. Think about the will of man.
[1:38:35] How's you how you get old and in a man
[1:38:37] of a broken spirit. So this is a body
[1:38:39] that's dying and and it it's just
[1:38:43] but now you can't be in two bodies at
[1:38:45] one time. But there you can have two
[1:38:48] natures in you at one time. Now the
[1:38:50] nature of the spirit of the lord when
[1:38:51] you are born again you're not born to
[1:38:53] physical like the baby was but that
[1:38:56] happened is the spiritual birth has come
[1:38:58] into you while the spirit birth is
[1:39:00] growing into your heart so it's a growth
[1:39:03] it's like a tree it's like the wheat
[1:39:05] plant right so when the heart condition
[1:39:07] we talk you know we know that the
[1:39:09] parable of the condition of the seed
[1:39:11] going into the ground and how that's a
[1:39:12] heart so it's got to grow
[1:39:15] but it's growing that's the the thing to
[1:39:19] take away. And when the life leaves the
[1:39:21] body, this is a this is beautiful. It
[1:39:24] goes to that body. Our theophony just as
[1:39:27] when the body is presented to the earth,
[1:39:30] the spirit comes in. And when the spirit
[1:39:32] goes out of the body, there is a body
[1:39:34] waiting. For we know that there are
[1:39:37] earthly tabernacle be dissolved. We have
[1:39:39] one already waiting. See, so what is
[1:39:42] your heart in tune with? What is your
[1:39:45] heart hearing from? You [snorts] know
[1:39:48] the very the the introspection here is
[1:39:50] is if your heart cares for the things of
[1:39:52] the world then that's that human nature
[1:39:56] heart.
[1:39:58] That's what you're hearing from. And you
[1:40:01] need to discern that voice in your life.
[1:40:03] Young children know that the world would
[1:40:06] try to tell you that's who you are.
[1:40:10] That's death.
[1:40:12] But you have another body. So there's a
[1:40:14] a nature that cares for the things of
[1:40:16] the world. But when you're born again,
[1:40:18] you receive a nature that cares for the
[1:40:20] things of God.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And that body, you have a new one.
[1:40:25] It's not like this body. It doesn't have
[1:40:28] the cares and the wants and the desires
[1:40:30] and the things that encumber us here.
[1:40:32] There's something that's crying for a
[1:40:34] complete redemption.
[1:40:36] I can't wait till I get out of this pest
[1:40:38] house.
[1:40:40] But if you got to realize, do you
[1:40:42] realize if you've been set free? That's
[1:40:45] more of a reality to you than the cares
[1:40:48] and wants of this flesh. You've been set
[1:40:50] free from it. But do you realize how
[1:40:52] many people are in bondage to keeping
[1:40:55] this thing optimal?
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; I mean, there's like some billionaire
[1:41:00] out there who's his I think he doesn't
[1:41:02] even want to get married because it
[1:41:04] might decrease his lifespan. I don't
[1:41:06] know what record he's going for, but my
[1:41:08] God's a got a record. [laughter]
[1:41:12] I mean, that guy, whatever record he's
[1:41:15] going to obtain
[1:41:17] a I mean, he can't even beat the Old
[1:41:20] Testament.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; My God's a got a record, but I got a I
[1:41:25] got a better record for you. I've got
[1:41:27] eternal life.
[1:41:30] But if you care for this world and the
[1:41:33] things of this world, that care is going
[1:41:35] to die with this body. You're I hope
[1:41:37] that your heart is declaring where your
[1:41:39] treasures are laid up.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:41:47] I'm going to get rid of my complexes.
[1:41:48] I'm going to read. I don't know if I
[1:41:50] read good or not, but hopefully this is
[1:41:53] salty enough you go back and find it.
[1:41:55] So, we're talking about what God's
[1:41:57] restored in this day. There's a bride
[1:41:59] tree. There's a fruit to be manifested.
[1:42:02] That's the life that's in you. It
[1:42:04] requires the heart that's been restored.
[1:42:07] We talked about Ezekiel. We talked about
[1:42:09] how that your heart now has been made a
[1:42:11] place where the very life of Christ
[1:42:13] could bring forth wells of living water
[1:42:16] where you are producing the very nature
[1:42:18] of Christ.
[1:42:20] But the original church began in
[1:42:22] Jerusalem at AD.33 on the day of
[1:42:25] Pentecost. That's where we'd have to go
[1:42:28] back to. I'm trying to get back there.
[1:42:30] But see, with the antichrist move,
[1:42:31] trying to make the antichrist, the real
[1:42:34] spirit of God, trying to move them back
[1:42:36] to the original faith again. Look at
[1:42:38] here. What does the palmer palmer left?
[1:42:41] The caterpillar eat. What the
[1:42:43] caterpillar left, the cankerworm eaten
[1:42:45] on down till it get down to the stump.
[1:42:48] Joel saw it and said, "I will restore,
[1:42:50] sayeth the Lord, all the years that
[1:42:52] they've eaten." Now it was about a
[1:42:55] thousand years there. There was nothing
[1:42:57] but a stump. So now we're it's come
[1:43:00] through the church ages. But you cannot
[1:43:02] because the life of that tree is
[1:43:04] predestinated to bring forth the tree.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; The intelligence behind this is a
[1:43:12] predestinated elected
[1:43:15] life force of God. He's going to have
[1:43:19] his heart's desire.
[1:43:25] Now about a thousand years predestinated
[1:43:27] bringeth forth a tree. Come up. Luther
[1:43:29] started it growing. What did he do?
[1:43:31] Organized. The husbandman pruned the
[1:43:33] branches. Come up to the Methodist. What
[1:43:35] did it do? Organize. Just like the
[1:43:37] mother pruned the branches. Come on up
[1:43:40] into Pentecostalism.
[1:43:42] Pentecostals. It's done the same thing.
[1:43:45] Organize. God has pruned back the
[1:43:47] branches. But that life in the heart of
[1:43:50] that tree has to live. God said I will
[1:43:54] restore. For the evening light has to
[1:43:57] ripen. In the middle of that tree stands
[1:43:59] the heart of God.
[1:44:07] This is the manger.
[1:44:10] This is the very place where God chose.
[1:44:12] He could have done it in the heavens. He
[1:44:15] could have done it in a lot of places.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; But he's chose to do it in you. In the
[1:44:21] middle of the tree stands the heart of
[1:44:22] God that the bride tree to meet the
[1:44:24] bridegroom tree just like it was in the
[1:44:26] Garden of Eden. Originally the tree, the
[1:44:29] two trees of life take Adam and Eve as
[1:44:32] the shadow of the two trees that
[1:44:34] actually stood there. Life and death.
[1:44:36] [snorts]
[1:44:38] Our position and where we stand is to
[1:44:41] know the very mind and heart of God.
[1:44:44] And a lot of what we said,
[1:44:48] it may look like it's an evaluation of
[1:44:50] our heart, but really, what was the
[1:44:53] heart of God?
[1:44:56] What was it that held him on the cross?
[1:45:00] If the musicians would come,
[1:45:03] what was it that would cause him
[1:45:07] to live a life that he could say, "For
[1:45:10] their sakes, I sanctify myself.
[1:45:15] And the privilege we have of knowing the
[1:45:17] mind of Christ was that
[1:45:20] we could understand the nature that
[1:45:22] we're to display.
[1:45:24] I I don't know of
[1:45:27] anybody else who could sit there and go
[1:45:29] back and tell you before the world was
[1:45:32] formed that you were in the thoughts of
[1:45:35] God that he desired to have a family
[1:45:39] that you were
[1:45:42] predestinated attribute.
[1:45:47] There's this the language of this
[1:45:49] message
[1:45:51] starts to speak to the nature of who God
[1:45:53] is
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; to the very heartbeat and the mind of
[1:45:57] Christ. And what we want is our natures
[1:46:00] by the Holy Ghost to be the lamb to be
[1:46:04] the the that the dove could rest upon.
[1:46:08] We don't want carnalism.
[1:46:11] We don't want the cares of this world.
[1:46:15] And that it happens, saints, our hearts
[1:46:17] need to be evaluated. They have we have
[1:46:20] to check up. We have to say, is God in
[1:46:22] this desire.
[1:46:24] And I believe that there's enough word.
[1:46:27] You know, you take a you take a rag.
[1:46:30] Sometimes I've cleaned up some very
[1:46:32] dirty things and you get it full of
[1:46:34] something, oil,
[1:46:37] and you start to take the water and you
[1:46:38] you run it over it. And it really isn't
[1:46:41] just just having the water run over it
[1:46:43] ain't really doing much. But you take it
[1:46:46] and you squeeze it out and you notice
[1:46:50] whatever that was in it, it it kind of
[1:46:52] starts to come out and you run the water
[1:46:54] over it and it kind of sponges back up
[1:46:57] and you squeeze it again. And as you
[1:47:00] wash that and you keep squeezing it,
[1:47:03] you're looking for when there's no more
[1:47:05] trace of the other thing that's been
[1:47:06] picked up in it. You just squeeze it a
[1:47:09] little more and you just you want to
[1:47:10] wash it out. I say, Lord, if you have to
[1:47:13] take my heart and you have to squeeze it
[1:47:14] a little bit, just squeeze any
[1:47:16] worldliness out of it and Lord, fill it
[1:47:18] back up with your word. If I feel a
[1:47:20] little pressure, if I feel like all of a
[1:47:22] sudden I'm having to make choices, what
[1:47:24] is it? You're washing my life.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; What I want to make sure is I don't fill
[1:47:29] it back. When I when I feel the squeeze,
[1:47:31] I don't want to fill it back up with the
[1:47:33] world. I want that water to come in and
[1:47:35] I want it to wash it. And I want to
[1:47:37] start feeding my heart the things of
[1:47:39] God.
[1:47:40] And you know what? He might squeeze it
[1:47:42] again because what is he looking for?
[1:47:44] He's looking for that time where what
[1:47:45] all that comes out of it is all the
[1:47:47] word. It's all the life, all the
[1:47:49] worldliness has been beaten out of it.
[1:47:52] It's proclaiming the very life and
[1:47:54] nature of Christ. But sometimes the
[1:47:56] heart has to be squeezed.
[1:48:01] We have to be willing to put our hearts
[1:48:03] on the potter's will and say, "Lord,
[1:48:05] squeeze it."
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Will you not my will but thy be done?
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust that spoke to your hearts
[1:48:35] tonight.
[1:48:37] Amen. I know the prophet said [music]
[1:48:39] that
[1:48:41] the number one killer of mankind is
[1:48:43] heart disease.
[1:48:46] and and and I and I really believe with
[1:48:49] all my heart that
[1:48:52] a Christian is one who's who's received
[1:48:55] the new [music] heart.
[1:48:57] We we are not called to take our hearts
[1:49:00] and [music] and try to insert religion
[1:49:02] and try to insert and and mix it up like
[1:49:05] our brother said, it's never going to
[1:49:07] work. You we need a clean heart and
[1:49:10] [music] a new heart. They said, "I'll
[1:49:12] take away this stony heart. I'll give
[1:49:14] you a new heart and and and [music]
[1:49:17] I'll take away your spirit. I'll put in
[1:49:19] a new spirit and I'll give you a heart
[1:49:20] of flesh. A heart that can obey the word
[1:49:23] of God. I I tell you, you can try to
[1:49:27] [music] live by the letter and try all
[1:49:28] that you can. It's all nothing but
[1:49:31] filthy rag.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; But what we need is a heart of a heart
[1:49:35] that can receive the word of God. But
[1:49:38] when I'm said in the church ages, they
[1:49:39] said you couldn't receive the word
[1:49:41] because you didn't have the spirit of
[1:49:43] God.
[1:49:45] I thought, "Oh, I needed the word so I
[1:49:47] can receive the spirit." No. The seed
[1:49:50] that's placed in you [music] was made to
[1:49:52] receive the word.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; And and I want to say this, it's not we
[1:49:58] come and we say, "Oh, if I was a child
[1:50:01] of God, then I'll do this." No. Because
[1:50:03] you are a son of God, then you will do
[1:50:05] it.
[1:50:07] It's not because it's the enemy that
[1:50:09] would come and say, "Well, if you are a
[1:50:10] son of God, then you would do this,
[1:50:12] right? If you're a son of God, then you
[1:50:13] do this." Then you're like, "Am I a son
[1:50:15] or am I not a son?" No. The reason why
[1:50:18] you're sitting here today, it's because
[1:50:21] God has touched your heart.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; And and what we need is is to separate
[1:50:29] ourselves from the things of the world.
[1:50:31] We God don't want us to be half filled
[1:50:33] with the world and half filled with the
[1:50:35] with the word of God. No, he wants it's
[1:50:38] our job. The scripture says that we hold
[1:50:40] our vessel in holiness and and we God
[1:50:43] wants to dwell in our heart. He created
[1:50:46] the heart. But Rom says no man builds a
[1:50:49] house so they can live it empty and he
[1:50:53] created your heart so he can dwell in
[1:50:55] it.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; And and that's what we desire. We said,
[1:51:00] "Lord, my heart has been drawn aside by
[1:51:02] the things of the world, but Father, I
[1:51:05] want to come back and I I want to clean
[1:51:07] my heart tonight. I want you to give me
[1:51:09] a clean heart and a hearts that cry out.
[1:51:12] A heart that will hear, a heart, a
[1:51:15] contrite heart and a broken heart that
[1:51:18] actually desires the things of God." Not
[1:51:21] just just run after an extra dollar and
[1:51:23] what I can gain for myself. A heart.
[1:51:27] Jesus was the heart of God. But when
[1:51:29] says, "I used to think that God hated me
[1:51:32] and God was against me until I saw Jesus
[1:51:35] Christ. He was the very heart of God
[1:51:38] manifested."
[1:51:40] Now, it didn't stop at Jesus. You are
[1:51:42] the very heart of God manifested.
[1:51:47] you know, and this religion or this
[1:51:50] gospel is not just for us to say, well,
[1:51:53] you know, as long as I I'm in a church
[1:51:55] setting, then we have to love one
[1:51:57] another. No, that's not what Jesus did.
[1:52:01] You know, says we we get to a place
[1:52:03] where people, you know, if you scratch
[1:52:05] my back, I'll scratch your back. He
[1:52:06] said, that's not how it ought to be.
[1:52:08] Whether you scratch my back or not, if
[1:52:10] you need, I'll scratch your back. Amen.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I I tell you sometimes we talk about the
[1:52:17] mysteries and the great things and the
[1:52:20] coming and the cloud and this and we
[1:52:23] forget the very fundamental
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; of what the Christian life is all about.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; It's about laying down our lives
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; so we can take up his. It's about giving
[1:52:35] up all that we are so we can take him.
[1:52:38] So as he was so are we in this world to
[1:52:41] every everybody that we meet. This
[1:52:44] generation has to know that Jesus Christ
[1:52:47] is alive and well. And the only way they
[1:52:51] would know is through your heart.
[1:52:54] [music]
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; God give us a right kind of heart. Why
[1:52:58] don't we stand and sing
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; uh create in me a clean heart of G.
[1:53:03] Amen.
[1:53:06] Create in me
[1:53:10] a clean
[1:53:12] heart.
[1:53:17] Oh
[1:53:19] God
[1:53:23] and winter arise

[2:02:09] Hallelujah. I trust that's your heart
[2:02:12] desire. That's my heart desire that my
[2:02:15] nature be changed and be filled with the
[2:02:17] love of God because that's the only
[2:02:19] thing that will bring about the change
[2:02:21] we [music] need. But a Chris, if you
[2:02:22] could just come and dismiss us tonight.
[2:02:24] Amen. If you need prayer, just come.
[2:02:26] [music] We'll be prayed for. We
[2:02:28] certainly enjoy the word and pray that
[2:02:29] the Lord will bless our brother. Amen.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:02:42] we just thank you so much for bringing
[2:02:44] us here tonight, Lord.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Father, we know that we heard from you,
[2:02:47] Lord. We've been in your presence that
[2:02:49] you were here. [music]
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Father, even if we didn't see you or
[2:02:52] feel you, Father, you said you'd be
[2:02:54] here, Lord. We know you were here.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Father, we've sang many songs now about
[2:02:58] a new heart, Father. [music] Lord,
[2:03:00] that's the desire of every person here.
[2:03:02] And I pray, oh God, that it'd be more
[2:03:03] than a song for us, Lord. God, I pray,
[2:03:06] Father, that you give us revelation and
[2:03:08] ISAF to search our hearts, Lord. I don't
[2:03:10] want to look at my heart through my own
[2:03:12] eyes, Lord, but may I see it through
[2:03:13] your word. And Father, I'm so thankful,
[2:03:16] Lord, that Lord, as it was said, I can't
[2:03:18] change it, Lord. That's right.
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; Father, you brought us here, Lord, and
[2:03:21] we're just trusting [music] that the
[2:03:22] work you start, you'll finish, Lord.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And I pray, oh God, that someone here
[2:03:26] tonight, Father, maybe they have the
[2:03:27] desire to lay a heart down. Maybe they
[2:03:29] don't know how, Father. I pray, God,
[2:03:31] that you'd move on every heart in this
[2:03:33] place, Lord. that there's a desire deep
[2:03:35] down that they want this heart that you
[2:03:37] speak of, Father. Lord, I pray, God,
[2:03:39] that you'd just break every chain, Lord.
[2:03:41] That you'd release it, Father. That
[2:03:43] you'd drive away the fear and the doubt
[2:03:45] and the worry and the complex, [music]
[2:03:46] Lord. That you just let them know.
[2:03:51] If you could just lay it down, you'd be
[2:03:53] in control of everything.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Father, we just thank you. We love you,
[2:03:58] Lord. We just commit the evening into
[2:04:00] your hands. We just pray that you be
[2:04:02] with everyone as we leave, Lord. Father,
[2:04:04] we just ask that you touch our brother,
[2:04:05] Lord. Restore unto him, Father. Father,
[2:04:08] fill him up. Give him virtue, Father.
[2:04:10] Lord, continue to speak to him, Father.
[2:04:11] We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Amen. You dismiss
[2:04:21] continue to remember our pastor. The
[2:04:22] Lord will continue to he's doing much
[2:04:25] better and we want to just continue to
[2:04:27] pray for him. Amen. Be okay. Key of G.
[2:04:33] Beautiful Lord.
[2:04:37] Wonderful Savior.
[2:04:40] I know for sure.
[2:04:44] All of my [music and singing] days are
[2:04:48] held in your hands.
[2:04:51] crafted [music]
[2:04:52] into
[2:04:54] your perfect
[2:04:57] [music]
[2:04:58] place. [singing]
[2:05:02] You gently calm me
[2:05:06] into [singing and music] your presence,
[2:05:10] guiding me by.
[2:05:13] Your [singing] Holy Spirit [music]
[2:05:17] teach me the Lord
[2:05:20] to live all of my life [singing]
[2:05:24] through
[2:05:26] your
[2:05:29] [music] heart.
[2:05:32] I'm captured by [singing]

[2:06:20] the parters.
[2:06:25] [music]
