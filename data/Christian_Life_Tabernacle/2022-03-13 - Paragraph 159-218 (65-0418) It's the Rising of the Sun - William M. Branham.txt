Description:
Paragraph 159-218 (65-0418) It's the Rising of the Sun
Sunday Evening Service 
March 13, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

name father as we just rejoice around your word and relax in your presence father receive the blessings that that you will pour out on us for our sacrifice father you never forget the labor that we put forth for your kingdom amen we're so grateful for that we ask it in jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn over to saint john the fifth chapter um read a little scripture here that brother branham's gonna comment on and okay let's just read starting with the twenty first verse and it says for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quicketh whom he will for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honoreth not the son honoreth not the father which hath sent him barely verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life amen heavenly father we ask you to place your word in your precious name we pray amen amen you may be seated amen we're just going to pick up here i i know that we had an awful long service this morning and i'm sorry about it and i know that a lot of people are home napping now because uh they got so wore out this morning but just remember some are going to be awake and some are going to be in bed right that's what the scripture says so i'm glad i'm awake and uh and things and uh we're trusting this so we're going to play just a few more a little more portion of the message this evening and uh i just had a thought that i was as i was thinking on this and it comes from this morning to the recognition that were eagles and i i wanted just to say if i i don't know how to call it but uh you hear the expression don't sell yourself short and you know a short sale is when you some sell something for less than its value or less than what's owed on it and sometimes a lender will take less than the person owes because they they feel that's the only way they're going to get anything at all you know what i mean so they make a decision that it's the best but they don't get full value and and our debt's been paid so there's no need for us to sell ourselves short because he's already appraised us and how he's appraised us he didn't appraise us as property that needs work you know what i mean he didn't he didn't appraise us as a fixer-upper you know what i'm saying now you might look at yourself as a fixer-upper but he don't look at you as a fixer-upper besides he has all the resources to fix you up anyway praise the lord right so we're just so grateful for that that he that we don't have to worry about that so because we listen to this and he talks about an eagle i'd like to just point this one statement out that he makes here as we're going to read this he says he's talking about the church he said he said blessed art thou this is paragraph 167 he said blessed art thou see son of jonas flesh and blood never revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell cannot prevail against it now that's pretty good you know what i mean i mean i like that promise i mean it's time for me to skip to place myself in every part of the word of god i've been baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i've received the word of god it's been revealed to me then the gates of hell cannot prevail against my revelation amen amen he says and i and i give unto thee the keys whatsoever you bind on earth it'll be bind in heaven and what you lose on earth that's that's that divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in the day by the sun the groom its flesh today by the bride see whosoever sends you remit them are remitted and whosoever sin you retain to them are retained now he goes on to talk about the catholic church picked up on that but they didn't have it you know they thought you'd do some sort of pence and your sins are forgiven but just think of the believer that means they rise right up above it all right you know what i mean there's nothing going to hold you down amen and you can just certainly really rest on that so this to not be very long tonight so that you can get home and take your nap after your sacrifice today and so we're just going to listen to this 15 minutes and just not spend very much time afterwards and maybe we can be we'll be out of here here in just maybe 6 30 or less if the lord blesses us and and then we'll go forward uh in this message brother branham sat down and preached this for two hours and 20 minutes straight and so with all the preliminaries and everything about a three hour service so we're certainly not trying to imitate him in any way because i just can't believe how much he puts in one sermon you know what i mean it's just like water just living water just flowing out of them and the statements he's making and and do you understand what he said this morning right the right when he quickens you that's your resurrection that's right hey amen that that's what he said that he had we just read it he says has life and never shall taste death he who heareth my words and understand them they have life and life more abundant so let's just listen here for a few moments this evening and then we'll move right along god bless you let me straighten the scripture here for you i think we're off of the phone but we are still here uh saint john 5 24. jesus said he that teareth my word and believe us on him and send me has everlasting life now look i go down the street just take that literally what it is without the spiritual understanding don't make it say nothing else but it's saying what it says see the right word there in the greek in the original it says he that understandeth my word now to prove that's right i go down yours there's a drunk coming along the street with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking god's name in vain and everything else like that say did you hear that preacher said did you yeah i heard it that don't mean he's got eternal life he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle now brother brown want more scripture than that all right my sheep hear my voice a stranger they won't follow amen as in the marriage and divorce case the other day when the holy spirit had told me that i come said it just the way he told me some minister lady gave me a right triangle balling out she said i guess you take the place of god i said no man never you told her sin is forgiven the word said only god has power said another pharisee that you might know that jesus told peter and the apostles after he had the revelation of who he was totally denied christ the son of god he said blessed art thou the son of jonah flesh and blood never revealed this to you my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church the gates of hell can't prevail against it and i give unto thee the keys whatever you find on earth i'll find it what you loose on earth that's that divine revelation of the word made if it was flesh in that day but the sun the groom is the flesh today by the bride whosoever sends your remit to them they are remitted whosoever sins your routine to them they are retained now the catholic church picks that up and takes it to their priest but that's carnal watch it was a spiritual reveal word that did it that's reason he told go baptize the name of father son holy ghost he knows they know who he was talking to a little preacher the day he said to me he said brother branham i've come out and joined one over to a certain a certain church a pentecostal church or the pentecostal how to start taking the round wafer you know you've heard of that i guess the kosher the moon god you know and they all accepted it and satan this man said this congregation went through and he said what i have blessed is blessed now you know what the priest says he has power to turn it back to the body of christ see just six to one half dozen the other that's the same and um he said i want to ask you something he is trying to dodge that issue of the baptism in jesus name because this was the man that said it was it was the antichrist that did this he said do you think it's all necessary that a man should be baptized in the name of jesus christ i said yesterday he said after he's been baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost i said yesterday he has been baptized at all he hasn't baptized at all no name that's the title i said he doesn't recognize i said why did uh why did peter he said well let me tell you something he said on acts 10 49 he said why peter he had to speak these words the holy ghost fell upon them but i said he turned right around and said can a man forbid water these should not be baptized he said well you're speaking over there a while ago about acts 19 where paul passed it up close to that he find them disciples and said well said they wasn't baptized in the name of the father son holy ghost i said no they were baptized unto repentance not for remission of sins unto repentance because jesus had been made on you the sacrifice hadn't been killed he said well why do they have to be baptized or i said the man that had the key said this forbid knowing unto you that there's not another name under heaven given among man whereby you must be saved salvation alone goes in the name of jesus christ whatever you do in word or indeed you at all in the name of jesus christ there's not another name no church no hierarchy no titles or nothing else yet he is the rose of sharon lilly valley morning star alpha omega beginning in the unit jehovah character manasseh all these he's all these things but yet he there's not no salvation in any of those titles jehovah no salvation rose of sharon that he is no salvation father son or holy ghost no salvation only the name of jesus christ and then the bible says that repentance and remission of sin must be taught in his name beginning at jerusalem and to the uttermost parts of the earth he said do you think it makes any difference i said sir i want to ask you something he and i and my wife are sitting at the table he just moved over stimulus i said we are both arizonans we live here and i and we know our council and our award and all our mayor governor everything i said now if i told you brother to go over here and sign up for our dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona would you go sign it like that you think they'd receive it at the desk he said why did jesus say that after this is it see wow if i told you to go sign for this dinner in the name of the governor of the state of arizona and us being citizens of arizona and knowing who the governor is well you know to sign it in the name of sam goddard see i said because he is the governor of the state i don't have to question you you know who the governor is and he said father son and holy ghost he knows how to go to baptize they know who he was my sheep hear my voice he said oh i see but now the next thing will you believe he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting and when this new eternal life dwells in you it is the potential when you have received this holy spirit now that they did at pentecost they were the mechanics now the dynamics had to come they had believed you know our good baptist friends tells us when we believe we've got it but they didn't have it yet they did believe it acts 19 did believe but they didn't have you received the holy ghost since you believed see they had the mechanics all right because the apostles were i mean apollos was teaching to them and proven by the bible the mechanics that jesus was the christ but they didn't have the dynamics yet that's it all right what panics you potentially have the earnest the waiting now when you get the dynamics you have been quickened from mortal to immortality it makes the whole body come subject to the word it makes you act different look different live different it'll just make you different now look then quicken you who were once dead in sin and trespasses of darkness has he quickened but by his spirit that raised up jesus on easter morning from the dead and if it dwells in your mortal body now watch it our soul quickens brings to life makes it subject to the word now how can you claim to have that spirit and throw yourself away from the word you're quickened by something else or it will quicken your mortal body to the word so it will you can't run without it you just flutter you don't believe all of it if you have pork gasoline part water you ain't gonna go nowhere okay you've got to take it 100 gasoline if you don't you're back far you ain't got no power well i believe this let it light up on that every word is true then notice how as we close notice this notice it's just like a little a little seedling in the ground now potentially you are resurrected you're resurrected when you receive the holy spirit in you you're resurrected right then your body's potentially resurrected look at a little steep plant in the ground it has to drink from its fountain the waters it pours down and as it drinks it pushes up towards him coming more like the likeness of the seed that went into the ground see the church come that way through justifications sanitation baptist holy lord now in the blossom see the spirit of god come through that and the spirit of the world has come to the antichrist the same way and now blossom out in a great union of churches see the whole thing and the individual comes that way everything works on the same on the same scale of god because he is the same yesterday and forever notice on your way growing to the fullness of the resurrection led by the spirit as the sun f-u-n pulls that little plant that's drinking from god's fountain just keeps see he can only drink from one thing you pour oil down that little seed one time kill it that's right you pour stagnated water old water ain't no good contaminated it'll stump the growth it won't bear fruit is that right but you pour real good soft rainforest hey man no man-made chemicals in it just let it come from the heavens above and watch that little plane there's no water or grow that like that for any water you put chlorine stuff in like you try to dose us up with and the first thing you know it kills a plant that's what's the matter today you try to give them water from the denominational fountain and it stunts the growth but lame have the calm world of dew drops of mercy shine all around me by day and by night jesus the light of the world and you've got it we'll walk in the light that beautiful comes where the two drops of mercy are bright just shine all around me take these man-made fountains away from me i know nothing but the blood of jesus that's all the fountains i want to know that's the word dwelling me lord water it was our spirit know it now if that spirit that raised up jesus from the grave dwells in you you potentially have life led by the spirit to quicken the word to you to believe it little thing keeps pushing up as it grows notice at pentecost their bodies were quickened to a new life look at a bunch of little cowards i'm always you know looking i'm just warmed up feeling good oh my notice they were towers notice but they had the mechanics but they were all sitting back in there oh and i'm great oh all them great big bishops and things i'm afraid to then preach the things i'm afraid to make that clean pray doc's out but he's going oh i just can't do that you see but all of a sudden the dynamics come yes and what did it do didn't always fill their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics their bodies were quicker they were no more cowards they went right out in the face of the people yes sir few men of judaism you to dwell in jerusalem or before the dynamics come they were just mechanics amen that dwell in jerusalem let this be known on you and heartly my words these are not drunk as you suppose i'm one of them this is that i'll show you what it is it's a scripture this is that and i always say just think that let me keep this to that counter no this is that that was spoken over the prophet joel it would come to pass last night says god i'll pour out my spirit upon all places see the dynamics come into the mechanics there was afraid no more some of you people that are afraid that some woman will laugh at you for having a long name some of you man that's afraid your organization will throw you out when you baptize your congregation in scriptural baptism you need to close yourself in the upper room till the dynamics come that's right it changed them it quickened them it made them different they were changed people from their own they quickened them from an old life of being a coward to a lack of the light of the tribe of jews they absolutely faced martyrdom nailed to crosses crucified upside down burnt part of their lives now no more tires death had no victory over them at all the dynamics was in the mechanics yes sir it quickened their mortal body now listen here's another thing for proof it's so quick enough in such a way do you know what they was lifted up in heavenly places and their mortal bodies were so quick until their language changed hallelujah it only quickened their language mortal bodies being quickened their language was quickened their thoughts were quicker their spirits were quicker their life were quicker they were quick and all together they tried to talk and couldn't talk in any more human languages they're so quick enough in the presence of god until they spoke in new tongues a heavenly language what a quickening power if the spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you it will quicken your mortal bodies it'll make you do things you didn't do before this full quickening power then see your body ain't subject to sin no more you you're sorry he said come on out here you say shut your mouth oh we got the biggest shut your mouth you're an eagle jersey our independent little eagle off he don't hop like a vulture see dead know the carrying lane on the ground doctor he walked around touch him out boy here's a good dinner over here it's not for me my desires has changed my appetite is different for a man shall not live on the world of carrying alone but by every word that perceives out about the god of genuine quicken eagles is [Music] amen means so be it amen i i noticed i wanted to point out one thing that brother bram said about that is that you notice how he said they go they go to the place where they say it's 6 601 a half dozen or the other it doesn't matter all these things matter the word of god is tied together do you know what i mean so every part that you do has a part of that quickening power with it after full obedience to the word of god will bring every promise of god to pass so it it it it just it it it it quickens us and and you know i i like that that uh the whole realization of it that you can actually get into the presence of god till it'll make you act different live different things it'll change things for you it'll change to the environment it'll change your perception and it's hard to go forward if you got you know blinders on you know what i mean that you just that they can't see and that's what the enemy does you know like when they take a horse they put these little blinders on them and they only try to get them to see one little line of thought but what the word of god does it comes and opens you up and what happens is if we don't careful if we don't let the spirit quicken us and we don't let it raise us up into heavenly places and we don't see the possibilities of the things that we can do by the spirit of god then we always live short you know we always live short we don't we we never we'll never step out now and so this he's starting to talk here and he says it made them different they they're sitting in a room because they're afraid the quickening power comes on them now they're not afraid there's possibilities there that that they've never realized before that that there's potential there that they really didn't even realize they've had and you've heard it people can look at somebody an athlete or or someone that's good with math you look at a child he seems to be very bright and you think of all the potential that child has all the things that they could become all the things that exist in them right now that just has to be uh trained or brought to life or directed and and if you could ever get them in the right environment if you could ever get them to the right place that that that quality could be developed into being a real uh a real protege they i think they call it or some really outstanding well that's all on the carnal side he's sitting here telling us that we've got potential amen you understand that in us we've got the potential and now because we've heard the word of god and now the spirit of god quickens that work to us makes it flesh and brings that potential do you think peter realized being a fisherman on a boat that he had the potential to see dreams and visions and see the sheep come down and go to cornelius's house and and and do what he did no the potential was there you think that you look at that little seed apple seed do you realize that in that apple seed is a whole nother tree of apples that the potential in that apple seed is there and and so just think of what the potential is of the seed of god being you as sons and daughters of god what's it need to bring it to that potential it just needs that real fresh water of god's word and it'll bring that potential out so we it changed them from being cowards into being lines of the tribe of judah it changed paul from murdering the church to building the church and so when we can understand that that we we limit our potential because of our complexes we limit our potential because of what we perceive as weaknesses we limit our potential as what we perceive as false and and our potential is limited and when we and then we start selling ourselves short we start saying i can't do this i can't do this i can't do that but that's not what the word of god said the word of god said we can do all things through christ jesus and strengthen them amen so that's what we we want to just leave with us as we're going to continue to go forward there's potential and where do you want your potential to blossom in the power in the kingdom in the working of the lord or we don't want to be lukewarm we want to realize that if it was manif word made flesh in the groom it's got to be word made flesh and the bride the works that i do shall you do also in other words because i go to the father i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come again unto you and i'll be with you even in you i'll be the spark that brings your potential to the service to the surface and so that's what he said if we could get into that presence get into that atmosphere of the quickening power of god if we could get to where it fell down he said they got so quick and it changed their language they went out there men and brethren this is not this is what was promised by joel and those guys took notice man these peas are galileans but they took notice that they'd been with jesus see they got into the atmosphere that awakened the potential that's in us and that's what the revelation of god's word does it it it awakens the potential that you have in you and you don't think that this church that was in his mind from the beginning that was his elect lady you don't think that she's got potential you don't think he's got in fact he said we're his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them i don't think we've tapped the potential and the power that we have as the sons and daughters of god the miracles that lie within you not you being the recipient of the miracle but the potential to speak the word that quickens and makes those things come to life and that's what he's beginning to talk about here about this spark this quickening of this mortal body that now these works can be done in this redeemed piece of clay and it could be manifested in the flesh so if you could just receive and and recognize and like i say we sell ourselves short oh i'm only a housewife i'm only a student i'm only this i'm only that i don't do i don't speak english good i can't do this well i'm bashful i'm shy i i've had some history in my past i've done this i've done that and pretty soon we've sold ourselves short we sold ours we convinced ourselves that we're not worthy to live up to the potential in fact we don't even look for the potential we've just closed the door on our own life just we just i don't expect anymore but he said the works that i do shall the person sit next to you do the works that i do the pastors should do the work said no he said the works that i do you shall do so basically he's saying you have potential to do far beyond what you can even think or comprehend amen if it's there we've just got to rise our thinking up into the potential of god's word and understand that there's a there's that god's got a spirit that can quicken that potential so you're not asking for an anointing you're asking for a revelation that quickens to you the potential that lies within you oh i i just don't know how to express it because i know i'm living below my privilege and that's what the prophet of god said he said i can't believe he said one of the sickest things today is the church of god because they're living so far below their potential so this as you go out this week i just want you to think of what god's done for you why that he's done it for you why that you understand the word because that word he said is that life and let me just read that statement again as we as we close here this evening he says that's the divine revelation of the word made flesh if it was flesh in that day by the sun the groom its flesh today by the bride it's flesh the day by the bride so everything that he is when he spoke of the groom he spoke of the bride and the bride can only bring to pass what's been spoken of her because what's been spoken of her is the predestinated potential that she has so it's just like me taking uh just the the the youngest uh a child in here like i i know this morning i forgot to uh uh recon nice elizabeth but uh just this morning if if we would just take her today we'd look at her she's a little child but if i was capable of speaking i would say you're a great piano player you're a great singer you're a great mathematician you're a great dish you're a great dad but we would only have carnal examples then once that's spoken that's the potential that that child has because i'm the creator so the bride he spoke the potential into the bride so she possesses the potential just like he spoke let every seed bring forth of its own kind so when he spoke he spoke that that seed would bring forth therefore the potential is in the seed to bring forth what it was spoken of so if he said you're the seed of god and you would do the works that he would do that you would be endued with the same life that he was endued that he wouldn't leave you comfortless but he would come under again another he's already spoke of your potential and then we sell ourselves short of the very potential he's given us for some carnal reason that he doesn't even see because he covered it with his blood and then what are we doing we're selling ourselves short we're not giving ourselves the value that we really are worth i can't do this i can't testify i can't i don't know what i i i don't know but i know what he said my potential was that the works that i do that i could do all things through christ jesus who what quickens me strengthens me sparks me so there's no need to shrink back there's no need to be afraid there's no need to go forward so you walk by faith because he already spoke the potential in you he said lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover is that what he said so that means i can only be what was spoken of me to be so he's already told me that i have the potential to lay my hands on the sick and they recover now what's that based on nothing else but his word and so he's can make that potential manifest in the flesh if it manifested in him in the groom it manifests in the bride so you understand he can't let the potential he spoke of not come to its fullness then he spoke something that's not true now i can lie but god can't amen i can say dylan's gonna break uh i don't know who hit the most home runs anymore it's kind of a controversy but anyway i could say you're going to break the home run record well but if god said he's going to be the all-time home run king he's going to be the all-time home run king i don't care how little he is or how blind he is or whatever it don't matter god said so god already spoke the potential now what's he saying he's saying i'm going to send my quickening power to bring the potential that i spoke of you to pass now what's my expectation deal i don't want to be live short i don't want to sell my shop short i don't want to think and look at all my complexes and and everything my strength is made perfect in weakness he's exalted by putting the potential in you and then doing it and bringing it past beyond your human capability praise the lord hallelujah exceedingly and abundantly great and precious promises that we have that he's going to bring it to pass but as we move forward in this and we understand why this is a beautiful easter that he's talking about why it's resurrecting because the potential that's in you that he's quick in this body and now the potential that he's spoken is going to resurrect out of the barnyard out of the flesh it's going to come to life and it's going to come into its full potential and it's going to be manifest what's spoken of it beyond our own abilities and that's a thrill can you imagine you slipping by a bedside and taking someone by the hand and praying for him and get well do you believe you have that potential do you believe you have the potential to sit down with someone and open the bible and start reading the scriptures to them and lead them to the lord and actually have the transformation power of god cleanse them from their unrighteousness and then to accept the lord jesus in their heart and come to life who does that you do that he does it in you it's the potential that he spoke of you that doesn't it's his word manifested in you that he already spoke it's already there every fruit is already in the seed every attribute of god is already in there it's in potential but he can't leave it in potential he's got to take it from potential into manifestation so don't and let's not sell ourselves short don't don't sell yourself short all things are possible to them that believe i it's it's i just can't even imagine what what the power that you possess and the miracles that can be wrought by your hand because he's already spoken so lord bless you let's stand together this evening and we'll have billy lead us in a couple of songs before we go so as we're moving forward understand that god spoke something that he has to bring to life do you hear that he spoke something that he has to bring to life he placed in you a potential and a promise that he has to make manifest because there's one thing he can't do is he can't lie so all you have to do is lift up and say here i am lord make me exactly what you had in mind let us pray our gracious heavenly father we appreciate your word so much as we're listening to our great messenger [Music] father here we've listened already to so much and he says oh my i'm just getting warmed up father and i think we're just beginning to take the wax out of our ears we're just beginning to come to the place hey there's more in this than i've thought it it goes far beyond just the messenger being the fulfillment of malachi 4 5. it goes far beyond just the receiving the anointing or the reign of the spirit this is actually the day where the bride actually comes into existence just as the groom was manifested in fleshly existence so is the bride resurrected in a present tense resurrection to a of the full potential of what's spoken of her lord and i pray that we don't sell ourselves short that we don't stop that we don't hit an obstacle and say this is all the farther we go we don't slip off in a ditch somewhere and say oh i've got to remain here but lord that we understand that if it's been spoken then it must be fulfilled the bride must come forth and fulfill and manifest what's been spoken of her that's your potential being brought into full existence lord i just pray that it'll sink in our hearts seriously and we'll truly get down to real business in this hour lord that we won't sell ourselves short and we won't be led away or sidetracked but we'll press the mark of the higher calling leaving those things which are behind behind and going up and forward for we ask it in jesus name amen [Music] my [Music] just [Music] me my [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] the praise
