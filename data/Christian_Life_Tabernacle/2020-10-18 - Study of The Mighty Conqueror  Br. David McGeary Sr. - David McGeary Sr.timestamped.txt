[43:24] amen amen god bless you this evening
[43:28] thank you musicians nice to be here
[43:30] let's turn in our bibles to the book of
[43:32] romans and
[43:39] we'd like to read
[43:53] start with the 33rd verse
[44:02] i this is romans the 8th
[44:05] chapter and the 33rd verse
[44:09] romans 8 the 8th chapter and the
[44:12] 33rd verse i've
[44:16] i always liked this scripture but it
[44:19] said who shall lay
[44:20] anything to the charge of god's elect
[44:25] it is god that justifier
[44:30] who is he that condemneth
[44:33] it is christ that died ye rather
[44:36] that is risen again who
[44:40] is even at the right hand of god
[44:43] who also maketh intercession for us
[44:48] who shall separate us from the love of
[44:52] christ
[44:53] shall tribulation or distress
[44:56] or persecution or famine or
[44:59] nakedness or peril or sword
[45:03] as it is written for thy sake we are
[45:06] killed
[45:06] all the day long we are accounted as
[45:10] sheep for the slaughter nay in all these
[45:13] things
[45:14] we are more than conquerors through
[45:18] him that loveth us for i am persuaded
[45:21] that neither death
[45:24] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[45:27] nor powers nor things presence nor
[45:30] things to come
[45:31] nor height nor depth nor any other
[45:34] creature shall be able to separate us
[45:38] from the love of god which is in christ
[45:41] jesus amen we'd like to look at that
[45:44] scripture
[45:45] 37 nay in all these things
[45:48] we are more than conquerors through him
[45:51] that loveth us
[45:52] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[45:54] word in your precious name we pray
[45:56] amen god bless you certainly always
[46:00] wonderful to be in the house of the lord
[46:02] and to fellowship
[46:04] around the things of the lord i guess we
[46:07] scared a lot of people away this morning
[46:09] but that's okay um
[46:14] it it is a a wonderful thing to
[46:17] uh hear the lord and know that the
[46:20] lord's
[46:21] speaking to you i'd like just to read
[46:24] with us you this evening and
[46:26] you should be able to put the
[46:30] statements up on the board but
[46:33] a message came on to my heart and it's
[46:36] called
[46:37] the mighty conqueror and i believe it
[46:40] was
[46:41] preached in 1958
[46:45] i believe the mighty conqueror and it
[46:48] struck me that
[46:49] paul said here that we are more
[46:52] than conquerors so we're conquerors and
[46:56] i don't think that we look at ourselves
[46:59] as being conquerors i think
[47:01] a lot of times our approach is that
[47:04] we want to
[47:08] avoid conflict
[47:11] but yet it's given to us to fight
[47:15] and so we want to do that i don't want
[47:17] to forget well it's on my mind
[47:20] levi i think it was your birthday right
[47:22] god bless you and then
[47:25] also it's brother billy's birthday
[47:27] tomorrow
[47:28] so everybody call billy tomorrow and
[47:30] bother him all day long
[47:32] with text and phone calls and everything
[47:36] i think
[47:37] it would really be good for him if he
[47:39] got about a hundred
[47:40] text in phone calls tomorrow just
[47:44] wishing him happy birthday and uh
[47:47] and as we certainly appreciate him here
[47:52] but uh you know what i was saying is
[47:55] that
[47:56] that paul tells us that we're more than
[48:00] conquerors
[48:01] so we're victorious victorious and
[48:05] and you know in this world
[48:08] there's always been many conquerors
[48:12] men that have went out and they felt
[48:15] that they
[48:16] conquered something they even they
[48:19] we could look at uh hitler he thought
[48:22] that he conquered
[48:23] france and europe and his goal was to
[48:26] conquer the world but
[48:28] he ended up being a miserable failure
[48:32] we look at constantine he tried to go
[48:34] out and conquer
[48:36] the whole world i remember when i was a
[48:39] young lad i
[48:41] i always uh i studied and read about
[48:44] attila the hun because he went out and
[48:47] conquered all
[48:48] the world and and the chinese in them
[48:52] were so afraid
[48:53] of the mongolians and and all the
[48:56] conquerors that they built a wall
[49:00] to try to keep them out the
[49:03] the great wall of china and uh
[49:06] so we find that that
[49:09] men have tried to conquer and tried to
[49:13] overtake the world and i thought
[49:17] one of the ones that brother branham
[49:21] brought to us was he talked a little bit
[49:24] about napoleon and if
[49:26] he says this in uh
[49:31] in the message there he said
[49:35] he says in
[49:39] i don't know let me he put this back
[49:42] here he says
[49:47] he says napoleon
[49:51] we all know was a being a great man
[49:55] but he started out on a good path when
[49:58] he was a young man
[50:00] at the age of 33 and this is
[50:03] a paragraph five
[50:07] out of the mighty conqueror if you
[50:09] wanted to put it up
[50:11] he a great man when he was a young man
[50:14] at the age of 33 had conquered the world
[50:17] and after he had whipped everybody in
[50:20] the world
[50:20] in all the nations he sat down and wept
[50:24] because there was no one else to whip
[50:28] and he died at the early age and
[50:31] alcoholic
[50:33] when he started off he was a
[50:35] prohibitionist
[50:36] but when he died he was an alcoholic
[50:40] he was so feared by the world
[50:44] i was reading a little book there in the
[50:46] airport
[50:48] that said that the women that night
[50:52] when they went to put the little babies
[50:55] in the bed as many mothers say
[50:59] if you don't go to sleep the old
[51:04] booger man's going to come and get you
[51:07] why they were frightened their babies
[51:09] more
[51:11] by saying that the napoleon
[51:14] was going to get them because he was
[51:17] such
[51:18] a murderer the little fellow when he
[51:21] would
[51:23] write their little eyes and slip under
[51:26] the covers real quick
[51:28] because they thought that the mighty
[51:30] napoleon would get him
[51:32] but he was defeated because he never
[51:35] played
[51:36] by the rules of the game
[51:40] you know that's something to think that
[51:42] in order to be a conqueror
[51:44] you have to play by the rules and he
[51:47] said all these great men
[51:48] that started out they all failed because
[51:51] they never
[51:52] played by the rules just remember as we
[51:55] keep reading just remember this
[51:57] that's a good lesson for the church of
[52:00] the living god
[52:03] if we don't play the game according to
[52:06] the rules
[52:08] we'll be just call disqualified at the
[52:11] end
[52:12] you have to keep the rules of
[52:15] the game to win
[52:19] and if the rules of the game in this
[52:22] place
[52:23] is a man must be born again
[52:27] to enter into the fellowship of christ
[52:31] and his church and we might be the
[52:34] greatest denomination
[52:36] on earth but if we haven't played
[52:39] the rules of the game we'll be
[52:42] disqualified
[52:44] at the end that's a rule that a man
[52:47] must be born again to
[52:51] to play the game and be successful
[52:54] so don't substitute anything for the
[52:56] rules of the game
[52:58] amen and we've got to come straight
[53:01] with god's rules if it isn't
[53:05] it it isn't our rules it's his rules
[53:09] and we've got to abide by
[53:13] we're running the race according to his
[53:15] rules
[53:16] and we have to abide in them so
[53:20] you see napoleon after
[53:24] though being a great warrior and a great
[53:27] conqueror
[53:28] he conquered people under fear and
[53:31] that's not
[53:32] the rule of the game the rule of the
[53:35] game
[53:36] is to conquer by
[53:39] love amen you know that still the
[53:42] greatest power
[53:44] that there is is the power of love
[53:47] and you can't conquer by fear you can't
[53:50] conquer by
[53:51] proving somebody's wrong you can't
[53:54] conquer by lifting
[53:55] yourself up above them that you've got
[53:58] the knowledge of the truth and you've
[54:00] got the wisdom of god
[54:02] we've got to play this game and run
[54:05] this race by the rules and the rule
[54:09] is that of the game is be conquered
[54:13] by love there's no
[54:16] other force in the world as great as
[54:20] love and i'm almost sure that we
[54:24] as people have put too much emphasis
[54:28] upon other rules that i don't mean to be
[54:32] rude
[54:32] but sometimes that we've made ourselves
[54:36] and put so much stress on the rules
[54:40] only to find ourselves disqualified
[54:45] oh my can you imagine if we could
[54:48] just let that sink in just the moment
[54:52] that we've got to play by the rule and
[54:55] our rule is we must be born again
[54:58] and that love is what we win the victory
[55:02] i'll tell you you can have a friend and
[55:05] you know i don't believe that we ought
[55:08] to run with the world
[55:10] but there's people in the world that we
[55:12] meet that they're friends
[55:14] and they're friendly too and and we come
[55:17] and contact them especially at school
[55:19] you've got to have fellowship you're put
[55:22] together
[55:23] with a lot of different people
[55:26] you've got to let that light shine and
[55:29] you've got to love them
[55:30] and people can sense the power
[55:34] of love and just think of that what if
[55:37] martin
[55:38] luther would have played the rules
[55:42] of the game right there never would have
[55:44] been
[55:45] a methodist church
[55:48] just think of that if martin luther
[55:50] would have kept with the bible
[55:52] and he would have loved the people and
[55:55] he he would have never got off the word
[55:58] of god
[55:59] and he would stay just with the
[56:01] scripture you know the next revelation
[56:03] martin luther would have got would have
[56:05] been sanctification
[56:07] and then after that he would have got
[56:09] baptism of the holy spirit
[56:11] and the word would have been restored in
[56:13] that aim but he left the rule
[56:16] and he went and he started out on his
[56:18] own thing building his own thing
[56:20] like we said this morning he put a
[56:22] tabernacle up
[56:24] and he let the people do that to him he
[56:28] said if martin luther there would have
[56:29] never been a methodist church
[56:31] if the methodists had played the rules
[56:35] of the game
[56:36] right there would have never been a
[56:37] pentecostal church
[56:39] but if we fail to play
[56:42] the rules of the game right god will
[56:45] disqualify
[56:46] us and raise up out of these stones
[56:50] children to abraham god wants the game
[56:54] played right and we must
[56:57] do it so it doesn't make any difference
[57:00] how much we
[57:00] feel like we're progressing
[57:04] on until we get back to the rule of the
[57:07] game
[57:09] we're really not going anywhere
[57:13] just think of that what it what it means
[57:16] in the paragraph
[57:17] 10 he says this he said
[57:20] and the strongest force that i know of
[57:23] is love though i speak with tongues in
[57:27] the midst of an
[57:28] and of tongues of men and angels and
[57:31] have not
[57:32] love i am nothing or because
[57:35] as some sounding brass and a tinkling
[57:39] symbol though i have
[57:40] power to move mountains and have not
[57:43] love
[57:44] i am nothing you know we always lean a
[57:47] lot on demonstration
[57:50] that seems to be something that people
[57:53] want to see i want to see the
[57:54] demonstration i want to see the power
[57:57] and people just preach and preach
[58:02] miracles and and i do i preach a church
[58:04] that ought to have power
[58:07] church that ought to be able to lay
[58:09] hands on the sick and have them require
[58:11] recover a church that
[58:14] that is about the father's business but
[58:17] the rule
[58:18] is it's governed by love
[58:22] if if it isn't that strong
[58:25] force then it's nothing
[58:28] so if we're going to play this game as
[58:31] we would
[58:33] call it we're going to win we've got to
[58:37] get back
[58:38] to the winning principles all these
[58:41] great signs and wonders
[58:43] that we have seen to god we
[58:46] give praise but if those things isn't
[58:49] built
[58:50] upon godly christian love and respect
[58:54] for god
[58:55] in his people it'll fail
[58:59] just it's just got to fail
[59:03] because it has no foundation
[59:06] amen and this great thing
[59:09] this great foundation of love
[59:13] just think of that now you've got to
[59:15] remember that we're in a contest
[59:20] we have to conquer and we're more than
[59:23] conquerors but we're more in conquerors
[59:26] when we abide in the rules
[59:28] and the rule is to be borne again and
[59:31] the rule
[59:32] is to love and when we stay
[59:35] in those places and we stay in that
[59:38] humility
[59:39] we will conquer everything all these men
[59:42] were mighty conquerors but they didn't
[59:45] follow the rules
[59:46] and now we hear a messenger telling this
[59:48] church you've got to follow the rules
[59:52] and so many many run out and
[59:55] and they try to do something they try to
[59:57] produce something they
[59:59] they try to make something happen they
[1:00:02] try to persuade
[1:00:04] somebody and then we know that we've
[1:00:07] been taught that if you can change
[1:00:09] somebody's mind somebody can change it
[1:00:12] back again
[1:00:13] but when a person sees that you're
[1:00:15] coming to him from the foundation of
[1:00:17] love
[1:00:19] that that that you conquer
[1:00:23] by love because then we realize that
[1:00:27] that's the rules of the game
[1:00:30] what a what a great uh
[1:00:34] rule if we look went to paragraph
[1:00:38] uh 17
[1:00:41] he said no napoleon was defeated as a
[1:00:44] drunken maniac
[1:00:46] at the age of 33 but at the age of 33
[1:00:51] christ played the game right and he
[1:00:54] conquered death
[1:00:55] hell sickness and the grave
[1:00:59] never was a conqueror like him
[1:01:02] and never could be ladies and gentlemen
[1:01:07] and my brothers and sisters it's time
[1:01:11] tonight for the church to pick up
[1:01:14] that which christ left us
[1:01:18] this will all men know that you're my
[1:01:21] disciples
[1:01:22] when you have love one for the other
[1:01:26] and take up the sword of self-sacrifice
[1:01:30] and get back to the old gospel line
[1:01:33] again
[1:01:34] going out to conquer our enemy
[1:01:38] conquer him by love by the same thing
[1:01:42] that god god so loved the world that he
[1:01:45] gave his only begotten son
[1:01:47] that whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:01:50] not perish
[1:01:51] but have eternal life amen
[1:01:54] it's time for the church to pick up
[1:01:58] back where he left us he'll know that
[1:02:00] you are my disciples
[1:02:02] by one your love one for another
[1:02:06] you know a lot of times we live in the
[1:02:08] church and
[1:02:09] never engage with anybody in the
[1:02:12] assembly
[1:02:14] we have our fellowship said on sunday
[1:02:17] morning
[1:02:18] but but our love ought to reach past
[1:02:20] sunday morning
[1:02:21] our concerns ought to reach past sunday
[1:02:25] morning the church isn't about this
[1:02:27] building
[1:02:28] it isn't about building more room for us
[1:02:32] it's not about all of us following
[1:02:35] something that we believe because we've
[1:02:38] all heard a message
[1:02:39] but it goes beyond that when you hear
[1:02:42] that message that message
[1:02:43] has got to be lived by the rule
[1:02:47] and that rule is a love and a concern
[1:02:51] and going the extra mile let this mind
[1:02:54] be in you that was in christ jesus let
[1:02:56] every man
[1:02:57] look upon the needs of the other before
[1:03:00] himself
[1:03:02] you see we can go on and create a great
[1:03:05] comfort zone
[1:03:07] in what we believe
[1:03:10] and we can be playing the game and
[1:03:12] forget the rules
[1:03:15] the rules you've got to be born again
[1:03:17] what does it mean to be born again you
[1:03:19] kind of
[1:03:20] have a new nature put in you new desires
[1:03:23] put in your heart
[1:03:25] you've got to you've got to play
[1:03:28] by by those rules and that's what jesus
[1:03:31] conquered by
[1:03:33] he conquered by love he so
[1:03:36] loved his brethren
[1:03:39] they were his kinsmen their names was on
[1:03:43] the lamb's book of life
[1:03:45] brother and so that's why he could raise
[1:03:47] up that
[1:03:48] i believe it was drivers daughter
[1:03:50] because he looked back
[1:03:52] down through the time and saw that her
[1:03:54] name was written on the lamb's book of
[1:03:56] life
[1:03:57] and she was part of eternal life
[1:04:00] so that's why he could call her spirit
[1:04:02] back
[1:04:04] and and he had that love for his own the
[1:04:07] scripture said he loved his
[1:04:09] own and they didn't receive them and
[1:04:12] they refused them
[1:04:13] the scripture says that he loved them
[1:04:15] even until the end
[1:04:18] he loved them that that's what he
[1:04:20] conquered by
[1:04:21] he conquered by the the love of god
[1:04:25] shed abroad in his heart and that's how
[1:04:27] we conquer
[1:04:28] by the love of god shed abroad in our
[1:04:31] heart and he said that's what the church
[1:04:33] needs to do it needs to take a sword of
[1:04:35] self-sacrifice
[1:04:36] and get back to the old gospel line
[1:04:39] again
[1:04:40] going out to conquer our enemy
[1:04:43] conquer him by love by the same thing
[1:04:47] that god
[1:04:48] god so loved the world you know we're
[1:04:51] more than conquerors
[1:04:54] and i really feel this i wish i had a
[1:04:56] better way of expressing it
[1:04:58] and and i could be more of a powerful
[1:05:01] preacher to get it to you but just being
[1:05:04] a pastor
[1:05:05] sometimes i just have to say things in a
[1:05:07] simple way
[1:05:09] but i really believe that god is trying
[1:05:11] to get the church to get engaged
[1:05:16] you know what i mean to carve our way
[1:05:19] into people's lives
[1:05:20] by the love and by the power of the word
[1:05:23] of god
[1:05:24] but by laying for ourselves a pattern of
[1:05:27] good works
[1:05:28] i don't think he ever intended for us to
[1:05:31] huddle
[1:05:32] in a little group and pat one another on
[1:05:34] the back
[1:05:35] and say we believe this and we believe
[1:05:38] that and we believe this and we believe
[1:05:40] that
[1:05:41] and we're the elected we're the bride
[1:05:43] we're the ones
[1:05:45] we're we were the only ones that got
[1:05:47] truth we're the only ones that's
[1:05:49] baptized
[1:05:50] right praise god as us and no more
[1:05:54] like i said i thought sometimes we ought
[1:05:57] to name the church
[1:05:58] you know we're right and everybody else
[1:06:00] is wrong tabernacle
[1:06:04] they know you're right when you've got
[1:06:07] the love of god shed abroad in your
[1:06:09] heart
[1:06:10] by the holy spirit that's how they know
[1:06:12] we're right
[1:06:13] because we're playing by the rules we're
[1:06:16] not just collecting money
[1:06:18] we're not just building gymnasiums for
[1:06:20] our children
[1:06:22] we're not just uh doing stuff for our
[1:06:24] group we're not promoting our group
[1:06:26] we're promoting him and we're
[1:06:29] pronouncing what he brings to a person's
[1:06:32] life
[1:06:33] when he comes into a person's life and
[1:06:35] transforms them
[1:06:37] that's what we're bringing we want to
[1:06:39] bring that love we want to bring that
[1:06:41] peace we want to bring that joy
[1:06:45] people are miserable
[1:06:49] you know it's not a time for us to
[1:06:52] withdraw
[1:06:54] it's a time to take the bushel
[1:06:58] off our candle and
[1:07:02] let it shine it's time to get back
[1:07:06] to the thing and when he was on earth
[1:07:09] adam's race had many fears
[1:07:11] and it's true they still have them
[1:07:15] but they shouldn't have them as
[1:07:18] arnold van winkler ended the war once
[1:07:21] and for all
[1:07:22] christ won once and for all
[1:07:25] at calvary verse 18
[1:07:28] or paragraph 18.
[1:07:31] when he was here on earth he walked up
[1:07:35] to a sick man that sickness
[1:07:38] had bound the human race and he said
[1:07:41] thou
[1:07:42] spirit of the devil i charge thee
[1:07:45] come out of the man he conquered the
[1:07:48] devil
[1:07:49] and when a man laid in the grave
[1:07:54] dead he conquered death for the man
[1:07:59] or sickness when the maniac come
[1:08:02] out to destroy him and the main
[1:08:05] maniac realized that he was the son of
[1:08:08] god
[1:08:10] he said oh if you'll
[1:08:13] cast us out suffer us to go into the
[1:08:16] bunch of hogs
[1:08:17] for he knew the authority that jesus had
[1:08:21] he conquered the devil and everywhere
[1:08:24] he met him
[1:08:27] he conquered the devil everywhere he met
[1:08:30] him
[1:08:32] no just think of that don't we believe
[1:08:36] that he lives in us
[1:08:38] that he walks with us that he goes with
[1:08:41] us and he conquers the devil
[1:08:45] every place that he meets him
[1:08:48] every time you meet the devil we are
[1:08:51] more
[1:08:51] than conquerors every place we meet the
[1:08:55] devil
[1:08:55] we are we are engaged in a battle
[1:08:59] of contrast every time we meet the devil
[1:09:02] is what he's shining and what we're
[1:09:05] shining
[1:09:06] what he's testifying to and what we're
[1:09:09] testifying too
[1:09:11] every time we come into conflict he is a
[1:09:14] conqueror over the devil wherever he met
[1:09:16] the word of god works any time
[1:09:19] any place anywhere any situation
[1:09:22] he's a such a great conqueror
[1:09:26] he conquered the devil everywhere he met
[1:09:28] him
[1:09:29] and he not only conquered
[1:09:32] in himself but he left the commission
[1:09:36] to the church that anything that you
[1:09:39] ask in my name that will
[1:09:42] i do oh
[1:09:46] think of it he was a conqueror
[1:09:50] but he left it for us to conquer
[1:09:53] but if we'll play by the rules
[1:09:57] we'll make sure we're born again and
[1:10:00] we've been justified and sanctified and
[1:10:02] filled with the holy spirit
[1:10:04] and we'll make sure that the love of god
[1:10:07] is in our heart and we're free from
[1:10:09] bitterness now we can take that
[1:10:11] commission and we can meet the enemy
[1:10:14] on every ground because he was the
[1:10:16] mighty conqueror
[1:10:17] and he commissioned us with him
[1:10:21] that we could conquer anything listen to
[1:10:24] this great next statement
[1:10:26] 19. i i just think this is one of the
[1:10:30] things that we
[1:10:34] we fail to see how
[1:10:37] simple god is and how he can use you
[1:10:43] satan might beat you down you think oh
[1:10:44] i'm nothing you know
[1:10:46] well that's true that's what nickelodeon
[1:10:48] spirit was
[1:10:49] that people got thinking they were
[1:10:51] nothing and they got thinking the
[1:10:53] preachers had all the power
[1:10:54] there ain't a preacher in the land
[1:10:56] that's got any more power
[1:10:58] than the simplest believer in this room
[1:11:03] god's not a respecter of persons gifts
[1:11:06] and callings are without repentance
[1:11:09] just because a man can preach the gospel
[1:11:11] doesn't believe he is the gospel
[1:11:17] it's you know it's blessed those that
[1:11:19] hear the word of god and
[1:11:21] that word abides within them he said
[1:11:26] he says you can conquer anything
[1:11:29] that you ask in my father's name that
[1:11:31] will i do fight will
[1:11:33] fight with what's in your hands
[1:11:36] if it's singing the gospel if you can't
[1:11:40] do nothing but whistle
[1:11:42] whistle just as loud as you can
[1:11:47] for the glory of god if you can't do
[1:11:51] no more than pat your hands pat them
[1:11:55] conquer with whatever you've got
[1:11:58] in your hand clap them in such a way
[1:12:02] that all the neighbors will love you
[1:12:06] whistle in such a way that all the
[1:12:09] denominations will know

[1:13:30] that they're called to be
[1:13:32] unless they're on the battleground
[1:13:34] remember when he wanted to take that
[1:13:37] great leader wanted to have somebody

[1:13:54] saw this old hardened soldier with
[1:13:57] scarves and everything that's the person
[1:14:00] he wanted in his cart that's what god's
[1:14:03] looking for

[1:14:16] age

[1:14:20] back
[1:14:20] you can say yes sir yes ma'am
[1:14:24] no sir no ma'am you can be polite
[1:14:27] you can be on the battleground
[1:14:30] you can you can treat all the
[1:14:34] the children and all your friends
[1:14:36] equally
[1:14:37] don't get with a couple little girls and
[1:14:39] side up and form little clicks and
[1:14:42] somebody else comes and wants to walk
[1:14:44] alongside each of you and
[1:14:46] you walk all the faster because it's us
[1:14:49] three and no more
[1:14:53] where's that stuff at
[1:14:56] you know what i mean that's the
[1:14:57] beginning of politics
[1:15:02] that's the beginning of clicks no
[1:15:05] stop come on join in
[1:15:09] we love one another you know just don't
[1:15:12] reach out for the most popular guys or
[1:15:14] the guy
[1:15:15] bring somebody in maybe someone that's
[1:15:17] shy maybe somebody that's not
[1:15:20] you know is a little kind of drawn back
[1:15:22] invite them in draw a bigger circle
[1:15:26] amen he says
[1:15:29] play it right we're living in a day
[1:15:33] that when this social gospel is becoming
[1:15:36] prominent
[1:15:38] when the churches are uniting themselves
[1:15:41] together
[1:15:42] and making a social religion
[1:15:45] and binding themselves together
[1:15:49] it's a terrible day
[1:15:54] they're trying to take all the deity
[1:15:57] and all the glory away from christ
[1:16:00] and trying to make him just a prophet if
[1:16:03] christ was just a prophet
[1:16:06] where everyone lost he was
[1:16:09] more than a prophet
[1:16:13] he was a conqueror he was a
[1:16:16] a a mighty
[1:16:19] conqueror and if we're one with him
[1:16:24] and we're united with him and his spirit
[1:16:28] dwelleth in us
[1:16:29] then we become conquerors
[1:16:33] we're more than conquerors with him that
[1:16:36] loved us
[1:16:37] oh what a what a call
[1:16:41] to the church to dust off
[1:16:45] our weapons and get back in the battle
[1:16:49] get back in the fight engage your
[1:16:51] neighbor
[1:16:52] engage the people around you engage the
[1:16:55] world
[1:16:56] spread your spread your cheer
[1:16:59] and your joy unspeakable
[1:17:02] to share the essence of what makes you
[1:17:06] what you
[1:17:06] are the love of god abounding in your
[1:17:09] heart towards many
[1:17:12] you know i think that anything this
[1:17:14] message has become so withdrawn
[1:17:17] and so pulled in that we've almost
[1:17:21] formed ourselves into a big clique
[1:17:24] and let me tell you sure they'll reject
[1:17:26] us
[1:17:28] as a whole but we don't care about the
[1:17:32] whole
[1:17:32] we care about the one we care about
[1:17:36] the last one we care about the one
[1:17:39] that's stuck
[1:17:39] in there that's in bondage and is
[1:17:42] thirsting and
[1:17:43] hungering for life that's who we care
[1:17:46] for
[1:17:46] that's why we're in the battle that's
[1:17:49] why our testimony is on the front line
[1:17:51] that's why our spirits are on display in
[1:17:54] case there's that little hungry
[1:17:57] eagle down in that chicken yard and they
[1:17:59] see an
[1:18:00] eagle go by in their life and there's
[1:18:03] something that says i want that
[1:18:06] i want to be a part of that what is that
[1:18:12] brother jackson we're sorry that he's
[1:18:14] home
[1:18:15] not feeling well and gary's not feeling
[1:18:18] well
[1:18:18] but that's good because their testimony
[1:18:20] goes together
[1:18:22] you know what brought gary to this
[1:18:24] message
[1:18:25] was the simple fact that jackson would
[1:18:27] never cuss
[1:18:31] he said man i just watched him every day
[1:18:33] waiting for him to cuss
[1:18:37] he said i knew there was a cuss word in
[1:18:38] there somewhere
[1:18:40] and i knew something was going to happen
[1:18:42] that was going to make him
[1:18:44] cuss or curse or whatever you want to
[1:18:47] call it
[1:18:48] nothing ever would but one day he just
[1:18:52] had to inquire
[1:18:53] how come you don't cuss
[1:18:57] and jackson couldn't say i but i just
[1:18:59] never did cuss i
[1:19:00] i grew up not cussing just never
[1:19:04] cussed in my life no uh
[1:19:07] no he said something changed me
[1:19:12] he was playing by the rules
[1:19:16] and when you play by the rules you win
[1:19:19] and and and
[1:19:22] so we we just read paragraph 24
[1:19:26] he said the sickness
[1:19:29] he never preached a funeral
[1:19:33] now that's something didn't it
[1:19:36] i mean i don't think you can go through
[1:19:38] the bible and ever find out where jesus
[1:19:40] preached the funeral
[1:19:42] he showed up late to a funeral and he
[1:19:44] ruined it
[1:19:49] he did he doesn't showed up late and so
[1:19:51] because he was late he just raised the
[1:19:52] guy from the dead
[1:19:54] that's how you take care of being late
[1:19:55] to a funeral amen
[1:19:58] he was a mighty conqueror he's the
[1:20:01] mighty conqueror
[1:20:02] and we are more than conquerors i love
[1:20:05] this he said
[1:20:06] the sickness he never preached a funeral
[1:20:09] death couldn't stay
[1:20:10] in his presence how could death and
[1:20:13] life dwell together they can't do it
[1:20:17] that's the reason today brother when the
[1:20:20] church
[1:20:20] is born again of the spirit of god
[1:20:24] death and life can't hold together
[1:20:27] something takes place christ
[1:20:30] comes in and conquers our passions
[1:20:34] he conquers our desires he conquers
[1:20:38] all that's ungodly about us and
[1:20:41] because he lives we live
[1:20:44] also he conquers everything that's
[1:20:48] ungodly he's already did it
[1:20:51] it lays at our hands
[1:20:54] just to receive you see what will happen
[1:20:59] to a church
[1:21:01] when we start playing by the rules when
[1:21:04] we start
[1:21:05] loving unders we sit around all the time
[1:21:08] talking about the great word
[1:21:12] that's been revealed the great
[1:21:15] mysteries that we understand
[1:21:19] how that the son of man ministry came
[1:21:21] forth and how god
[1:21:23] veiled himself in a prophet until that
[1:21:25] it was actually jesus christ in our
[1:21:28] midst using a fleshly skin
[1:21:32] to be present in our day doing the same
[1:21:35] signs and wonders
[1:21:36] but we can witness so far above people's
[1:21:40] head
[1:21:41] that like we're trying to contact their
[1:21:45] intellect
[1:21:49] when we ought to be when we ought to be
[1:21:52] just so
[1:21:52] down to earth wanting to share with them
[1:21:56] these great benefits
[1:22:01] and continuing out of paragraph
[1:22:05] 24. we see him
[1:22:08] in his earthly minister ministry
[1:22:12] as a conqueror certainly
[1:22:15] we do but now let's watch him
[1:22:18] after he died he still
[1:22:22] went on conquering
[1:22:25] so he ain't done conquering he ain't
[1:22:27] done conquering on your behalf
[1:22:29] and he ain't done converting you into a
[1:22:32] conqueror
[1:22:35] amen you know if the devil's got one of
[1:22:36] your loved ones go after him
[1:22:40] go to praying go to lana before god go
[1:22:43] to ask god to do things
[1:22:45] jesus even give the parable of the
[1:22:48] unjust judge
[1:22:50] and the the i believe it was a widow
[1:22:52] that
[1:22:53] besought him and he didn't answer he
[1:22:56] answered her to get
[1:22:58] her off his back
[1:23:02] give this woman what she wants i
[1:23:06] don't want her in my court anymore
[1:23:10] and he says how much more a father that
[1:23:12] loves you
[1:23:14] which one of you as earthly parents if
[1:23:17] your child
[1:23:18] asks for a fish
[1:23:21] you'd give them a a a serpent
[1:23:25] or ask for bread you'd give them
[1:23:28] a stone he said how much more your
[1:23:31] heavenly father
[1:23:33] amen can you imagine when you go to say
[1:23:35] you know what i'm tired of that spirit
[1:23:37] on my child
[1:23:38] i'm tired of that spirit on my loved one
[1:23:41] satan
[1:23:41] i've come to meet you with the word of
[1:23:44] god i've come to meet you with every
[1:23:46] promise
[1:23:46] i'm going to play by the rules i'm going
[1:23:49] to let my love shine to everybody that i
[1:23:51] come in contact with
[1:23:53] i'm going to make sure my life's borne
[1:23:55] again i i've come to play the game
[1:24:00] and i like that analysis we don't play
[1:24:03] to lose
[1:24:05] in fact we've already won
[1:24:11] but now let's watch him after death
[1:24:14] he still went on conquering he never
[1:24:17] ended
[1:24:17] at the grave the bible said his soul
[1:24:20] descended into hell
[1:24:22] and he preached to the spirits that were
[1:24:25] in prison
[1:24:27] that repented not in the long suffering
[1:24:30] of the days of noah i can see him
[1:24:35] as the heavens and the earth
[1:24:39] turning black the rocks
[1:24:43] at belched out of the mountains
[1:24:47] the whole heavens the moon the stars
[1:24:49] refused to shine
[1:24:52] he conquered it and when he went down
[1:24:55] and descended down
[1:24:57] and knocked at the door where those lost
[1:25:00] souls was
[1:25:02] and when the doors came open
[1:25:05] and those people who laughed and made
[1:25:09] fun of enoch and made fun of noah
[1:25:12] i can hear him say i am that one
[1:25:16] that enoch said would come with ten
[1:25:19] thousands of his saints
[1:25:21] why didn't you believe enoch why didn't
[1:25:24] you believe
[1:25:25] noah everything had to know
[1:25:30] that he conquered
[1:25:34] everybody has a right to know
[1:25:37] that jesus conquered you're that
[1:25:41] messenger
[1:25:42] and when he shut the door on them the
[1:25:45] days of mercy was passed
[1:25:48] and on down into the lowest pits of hell
[1:25:50] he went
[1:25:52] and he knocked at the city
[1:25:55] doors of the devil's hell
[1:25:59] and the devil come to the door
[1:26:02] and as we could look to see
[1:26:05] and there he said well here you are
[1:26:09] after all
[1:26:10] i sure thought i had you when i killed
[1:26:13] the prophets
[1:26:15] i sure i
[1:26:18] sure thought i had you when i had
[1:26:22] john's head cut off in prison
[1:26:25] but now after all
[1:26:28] you've got here hi that devil
[1:26:34] he think oh here you are you know
[1:26:38] i can hear him as he said
[1:26:41] straighten it himself up and said satan
[1:26:45] i am the virgin-born son of the living
[1:26:49] god
[1:26:50] my blood still wet on the cross
[1:26:53] i paid the price i've conquered
[1:26:57] and i've come down to take over
[1:27:00] strip you of everything that you claim
[1:27:03] that you had
[1:27:05] reached over to his side and jerked
[1:27:08] those keys of death and hell off of him
[1:27:12] kicked him back into the place
[1:27:15] where he belonged he conquered hell
[1:27:18] and he rose and he had the keys of death
[1:27:22] and hell hanging on his side
[1:27:26] what's the church scared about then
[1:27:30] amen he conquered satan he conquered
[1:27:33] sickness
[1:27:34] he conquered death he conquered hell
[1:27:37] he's on his road out remember there's
[1:27:41] some more faithful than when
[1:27:45] went on to they were in a place
[1:27:49] called paradise and they could not go
[1:27:52] into the presence of god because they
[1:27:55] had worshipped
[1:27:56] under the shed blood of lambs and goats
[1:28:00] and so forth it never
[1:28:03] divorced sin it's only covered sin
[1:28:08] just think of that they didn't they
[1:28:11] weren't
[1:28:12] they weren't in hell but they still
[1:28:15] couldn't enter into paradise
[1:28:18] because they were on the covered blood
[1:28:21] but when the shed blood come
[1:28:23] that's why they came out of their graves
[1:28:25] and many walked
[1:28:26] and that was the first resurrection
[1:28:29] hallelujah
[1:28:30] and that's it today friends you can't
[1:28:33] cover your sins
[1:28:35] and get in you've got to get rid of it
[1:28:39] and there's only one thing that will do
[1:28:41] it
[1:28:42] and it isn't your church that isn't your
[1:28:46] baptism
[1:28:47] by water it's the blood of jesus christ
[1:28:50] that covers
[1:28:51] sin and divorces it and the only means
[1:28:55] of
[1:28:56] conquering that there is is through the
[1:28:58] blood
[1:28:59] of the lord jesus amen isn't that
[1:29:03] wonderful
[1:29:04] just think of it as we read these last
[1:29:07] statements
[1:29:08] and and
[1:29:11] we go on what is it
[1:29:17] he saw something real it's the story of
[1:29:20] burke you all know it
[1:29:22] what is it he saw something real he saw
[1:29:25] something that wasn't put on
[1:29:28] he saw something that wasn't
[1:29:30] hypocritical
[1:29:31] he saw something that was genuine
[1:29:34] and there on the snowy bank i led that
[1:29:38] cruel hunter
[1:29:40] cruel hunter
[1:29:44] hardened hunter to the lord jesus christ
[1:29:48] and he became a sweet humble christian
[1:29:51] why
[1:29:52] all the preaching didn't do it it was he
[1:29:55] saw something real
[1:29:57] oh church of the living god
[1:30:00] the world's looking for something real
[1:30:03] tonight
[1:30:05] would you love to have enough
[1:30:08] christ in your heart that you could
[1:30:12] stand
[1:30:12] in the face of death even you sick
[1:30:16] people
[1:30:17] that's sick could you just take him
[1:30:21] at his word live or die
[1:30:24] stand here on his word you that's had
[1:30:28] these differences and all these
[1:30:31] little troubles denominational barriers
[1:30:35] wouldn't you love to have something to
[1:30:38] display
[1:30:40] that when you walk down the street men
[1:30:43] and women say
[1:30:45] if there's ever was a godly woman or man
[1:30:49] there it goes something real
[1:30:54] a life that tells
[1:30:58] isn't that what we want a life that
[1:31:01] tells
[1:31:02] and i think that this is what he's
[1:31:04] saying
[1:31:05] when we can come into the unity of that
[1:31:09] every member in this church realizes
[1:31:12] that they're
[1:31:13] part of this great con
[1:31:16] conquering army then everybody in our
[1:31:19] hearts
[1:31:20] in our lives realizes that we're called
[1:31:23] to put something on display
[1:31:26] that's real and that's genuine
[1:31:30] and if we live by those rules
[1:31:33] we lay aside all the bitterness all the
[1:31:36] differences
[1:31:37] and we know that he's conquered all
[1:31:39] these things for us
[1:31:42] and in him we're more than able
[1:31:47] and when we can come into that
[1:31:50] humility of the spirit and realize
[1:31:54] we're more than conquerors and we can
[1:31:57] bring
[1:31:58] our christianity and live it by the
[1:32:00] rules
[1:32:01] not by the doctrines but by the rules
[1:32:06] i think that we will see and as i say
[1:32:09] in closing i feel such a pull
[1:32:13] of the spirit to the sons and daughters
[1:32:16] of god
[1:32:17] to get involved to
[1:32:21] put that life on display
[1:32:25] to step out and show this world
[1:32:28] that you truly are the sons and
[1:32:30] daughters
[1:32:31] of god let's stand together
[1:32:46] let us bow our heads and maybe
[1:32:50] even any that's listening at home
[1:32:53] tonight
[1:32:54] [Music]
[1:32:57] i'd just like to ask and
[1:33:00] for you to look at your own heart and
[1:33:02] your own spirit
[1:33:09] maybe you've been a little bit in the
[1:33:11] closet as a
[1:33:13] christian
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:18] and you've been a little timid to
[1:33:25] and reserved and
[1:33:27] [Music]
[1:33:30] maybe you haven't been in the battle
[1:33:32] [Music]
[1:33:34] you haven't laid for yourself a pattern
[1:33:36] of good works
[1:33:38] [Music]
[1:33:40] you never step out of your complex to
[1:33:43] reach out to someone
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:48] and you just seem like you're all
[1:33:51] bottled up
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:33:55] and you like to lift your hands and say
[1:33:57] lord
[1:33:59] i'm more than a conqueror i can overcome
[1:34:03] this complex
