please have seats so one thing I want to tell you is one word I want to start this testimony with is p-u-s-h push this is the word I learned when I was little kid back in India used to go to convent school Holy Cross School that was the name and uh one of the preacher he he shared that so This Acronym has been with me p-u-sh since I was I was a kid stand for pray until something happens p-u-s-h in my testimony today it took 17 years 17 years we came here in 2001 we became citizen in 2007 and that's where my mom applied for my sister to come stay with us and it took 17 years her petition was approved 2020 and that's where the kovid happened so everything shut down and that delayed another four or five years but glory to God last week my sister and her husband and the kids they were able to put their feet here in the United States of America and they are here with us today so thank you so glory to God glory to God one another reason I wanted to share this testimony with you is sometimes it feels like nothing is happening we just continue to pray continue to pray but uh it is um I I came from India where where Hinduism and other religions are are very strong very prominent and we everywhere we go we see the temples and and Bible States this very very clearly they have gods they cannot see they have they have gods they cannot walk they have ears they cannot see just glory to God that we have a god even if we do not even say a word he listens to our hearts we do not even have to say a word and he know exactly what we are going through so my encouragement to you is just continue to stay strong in faith This is the End days and I'm just I we do not know when the Lord is going to come and we are just ready God bless you all hey man let's just sing that song in the key of G as brother Mike comes I just came to glorify his name well I just came to glorify [Music] glorify your name oh and I just came to glorify glorified [Music] there's no sweeter name I know I'll

name I know I'll tell it I'll tell it wherever I go I came to glorify [Music] glorify your name [Music] good morning did you enjoy that I'm going to use that again pray until something happens that's uh that's wonderful we're gonna read in Psalm 53 this morning you know and you'll notice as we read through this that this is really just uh kind of a perfect summary of the the world that we live in today it's you know the condition of the people the attitude concerning God and his word and just kind of the general state of the world around us just from the very start in verse 1 the fool had said in his heart there is no God corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none to do with good reading out of verse 3 every one of them has gone back they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one you know I was reading that in honestly outside of the work of God in our lives this would describe us would be no different outside of his grace and outside of his hand the word that he sent you know David speaks to this as he closes the psalm he says oh in verse 6 oh that the salvation of Israel were coming to Zion you know what I was reading that who is that salvation of Israel remember what old Simon said in the temple in Jerusalem when a young couple brought a little baby to be dedicated he said in Luke 2 29 Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy Word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation you know when Peter declared that when he was brought before the Sanhedrin in Acts 4 12 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved can we say that the salvation of Israel has come that David spoke of you know he continues in verse 6 when God bringeth back the Captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad you know David was speaking of a coming day and we know that this was fulfilled when Jesus came on the scene because it says in Ephesians 4 8 wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men you know he has come he is present he has fulfilled the word concerning him we believe these things but you know as I was reading Psalm 53 this week there was a verse that in particular that stuck out to me and it was in verse 5. says this there were they in great fear where no fear was think about that being in fear when there's no reason to fear you know this is a reference of the Judgment being visited upon the Earth but it occurred to me how many times do I fear when there is no fear how many times do we find ourselves fearing an outcome fearing the end fearing what's going to happen next varying the effects of something or the future and there is no fear there's nothing to fear you know the salvation of Israel has come the captor has led captivity but you know his presence is here but his presence is that place where no fear is and yet still if we're not careful we can find ourselves in fear David said in Psalm 23 and verse 4. he said yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why for thou art with me the salvation of Israel the captor of captivity itself where no fear is you know he doesn't sometimes we don't feel it but he doesn't manifest himself by feeling he manifests himself by his word he said he was here you know the question is is how many times do we fear when no fear is when he's present you know Jesus told individuals time and time again be not afraid fear not you know they were in fear even when he was in their midst afraid of an outcome of a condition of a circumstance whatever it may be you know in messages like Awakening Jesus or calling Jesus on the scene brother Branham spoke of a time when the disciples found themselves on the sea in a great storm it says in Mark 4 37 that the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and the disciples were in great fear they were in fear for their lives and yet there was Jesus there the whole time they could see him with their eyes and still they were afraid they were in great fear where no fear was you know of course we all know the story they ran and woke Jesus and he spoke a word and calm the storm but you know what's interesting to me that you look at the disciples reaction but look at Jesus in the middle of that storm he was comfortable enough to rest to sleep even when the boat was full of water and he was sleeping but the disciples were in fear there had never been a word that had gone forth let's go to the other side that was that was the word that had to be fulfilled what happened in between was irrelevant but the people were in but the disciples were in great fear nonetheless when no fear was you know fear is the opposite of faith Jesus finally told them in verse 40 Mark 4 40. why are ye so fear fearful how is it that ye have no faith you know fear is not the opposite of feeling his presence fear is the opposite of faith you know he said that he would he said by his word that he would never leave us or forsake us we're in a condition of where no fear is so I wonder how many times we still have fear when no fear is that's a symptom of judgment as we'll read here in a little bit but you know John says in first John 4 hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God in every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God you know the spirit of fear is a confession that he has not come that he is not present you know it says later in first John 4 verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness not fear in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world consider Jesus response to the Storm at the sea he was in perfect rest as he is so are we in this world he goes on to say there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love and remember we live in an hour when the hearts of children have been restored to the fathers let's go ahead and stand this morning we're going to read Psalm 53. but as we read that and we consider our day and the day of judgment that we live in you know I think at least to me it was a reminder not to fear when no fear is there is no fear there's no reason to fear why are you fearful let's just go ahead and read that together and remember that he is come his presence is here there is no fear let's read that starting at verse one the fool had said in his heart there is no God corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good God looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek God every one of them has gone back they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon God there were they in great fear where no fear was for God has scattered the bones of him that incapeth against thee thou Hast put them to shame because God had despised them oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion when God bringeth back the Captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad amen praise the Lord you may have your seats I want to sing that song at Calvary key of C [Music] years I spent Infinity [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I rap [Music] Ed [Music] Hallelujah [Music]

and offerings and also I mentioned some prayer requests and praise reports um I read this brother griever writes I asked prayer for my wife and then I just thought I'm just going to put a comma here and read it like he wrote it as a testimony she has been feeling well in her throat so I thought I'm just going to read it the way he wrote it I know what he meant but he put on paper testimony so praise God because by his stripes we are healed amen I believe that uh we're a supernatural people and sometimes we do things and we think it's it doesn't mean anything but if we're the word made flesh well praise His Wonderful Name also the rush Family writes a a special need for a family member a sister of one of the family they they just really need the lord they're in a bad situation so if you just want to take that burden upon your heart and maybe speak with them and um get in the trenches with them many times we we just allow prayer requests just to come over the desk and we never even think about it again but that's not the purpose the purpose is as a family as a body of Believers there's that there's a need and a burden that's being presented and we want to go over to them say hey I'm I'm gonna carry that with you that means a lot also uh brother Tommy just wants to make mention that the trusses for the roof are coming in for the new building and there's some rain in the forecast but we're just wanting to ask God for good weather and just everything to go well also brother Darian wants to ask prayer for a young man named Jeremiah in Tennessee who's he's questioning his walk with the Lord and we just want to pray that God would make himself real to him at this time and that perfect love would chase away the fear and chase away the doubt and he'll come out of this trial rooted and grounded in love and Mabel to help somebody else that's going through the same thing um we have a couple praise reports brother Darian says praise God for his delivering hand of love and grace my brother Charles has been delivered of alcoholism his own testimony this past Saturday praise His name Hallelujah that's the God we serve amen he's a God who delivers he's a

own lives Lord may we just be strengthened to know that even in the trial that you're using us to bring forth good you're using us to speak to others hearts and give them hope and courage that if if we can keep pressing the battle then I can keep pressing too Lord it all plays a great role in your great plan father as we are looking for the sweep after the coming of the lord we just want to ask a blessing upon the ties and the offerings now Lord all the needs that were made mentioned we commit them to you and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let's just sing sweep over my soul as we'll just

see that you are mindful of your people you said nothing would pluck us out of the palm of your hand father though many times we've tried to get out we've tried to get away we've tried to run but you sought us with patience Lord and Loving Hands and you return us back to your fold and forgive us and comfort us and remind us that you're our place of safety father we ask you to bless the needs of the people this morning may your word touch their heart may they feel at a fight this morning with your blessings and your goodness we asked this morning Father that our Spirits could be open to you and Lord if we know something's not right then let us just be honest with you say Lord I don't have the right heart I don't have the right mind I don't have the right attitude but you're the Creator and The Giver Lord and I ask you to transform me this morning to be what I ought to be in your name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning certainly nice to be in the house of the Lord and and as we continue to go forward you know okay finally we come time you know we're going to put the trusses and we have a week of rain in front of us and and we had the forms all set and they all washed out and so I get frustrated and then I just got to sit back a moment and say you know there's somebody else in control here and you know I was real discouraged how long it was taking us to get the permit and everything but did you know that right when we got our building permit and started to build Lumber came down 60 percent and we got the lumber for the same price we would have two years ago it took two years but he's in control amen you believe that so we're just gonna go forward and make the mistakes we make and he'll fix them amen let's turn in our Bibles to uh Nehemiah and uh we want to read a couple's scriptures there found in the book of Nehemiah I just pulled my book marker out so let me find it here real quick and uh um the book of Nehemiah here I think it's in the same place it's always been but uh it just takes me a little longer to get places now than it did I might have to grab somebody else's bio though here yeah I even have the page number all right here it is let us read now let's just read our scripture and we'll sit down and so we're going to read in the second chapter and the 10th verse second chapter and tenth verse and see if we can draw some uh encouragement from the word of the Lord when Sam ballet the horror night and tuba the servant the Amorite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel father we ask you to bless your word to us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you we certainly have been enjoying this book it's one of my favorite books in the scriptures and I'd like to uh just kind of walk through some of these things again with us we know the story that there was a cup Bearer and some of his family members came to visit and he inquired about how things were going and as he did that they begin to express to him what a distress that they were in that the city was in disrepair that they were in uh a bad way and it became a burden on nehemiah's heart so much so that the burden began to reflect in his continents in other words his whole atmosphere his whole approach to life his whole being was now been affected by the condition of his brethren and it moved upon him so much that he finally made his request to the king and the King told them to go do what he's done and he showed up in Jerusalem and we see this great uh scripture here that he speaks and it talks about the people around about him and everything that they were grieved that there came one that sought the welfare of the children of Israel or of the Israelites and we know that this great uh uh people at one time was a great people they turned away from God they got carried back into captivity but yet God's Got A Plan for their lives and so we know that the story's going to go forward but there's so many wonderful things that are contained within the framework of that and and he says here he says they were and it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel and I thought in my heart I don't have titles much but I thought these people called Israel who were these people called Israel and you know Israel is a type of the Bride you we know that the way God dealt with them and and we look back on Israel and we think about it uh where did they come from who are these people Israel what brought them into existence the very fact that they were the very fact that they were they were where they are the circumstance that they were in the fact that just 16 years earlier their Temple had laid in Ruins and now their city is laid in Ruins and so we asked ourselves who are these people who are these people Israel and and what caused them to be and if we would ask ourselves this morning who are these people that we call Believers or or message followers or the bride we are not a religion we are a people you understand we are birthed of something we are birthed of a Heritage we are birth of a promise we are birthed and and so in that type who are these people and and we understand that these people came into existence because one day and well-strickened in aged man and a well-stricken an age woman got a promise from God that God came on the scene and said Abraham you and Sarah are going to have a child and we understand that these people came into existence because they were visited by Melchizedek they were visited by if I could say it in the light of our age they were visited by the son of man God veiled in flesh in the form and came to him and delivered them a promise and Out of This Promise a people came into existence not a religion but a people and so who were these people well these people were a people that were built on a revelation they were built on faith election and revelation that's how they came in existence because Abraham received a promise and he believed that the god that made the promise was able to perform that which he promised just think of how much this types us this morning I believe there's going to be a rapture I believe that God promised us and I hope it comes real to us that one day that we are going to transform from this world to another world that our bodies are going to be changed in a twinkling of an eye in just a moment and if some of us would happen to go by way of the Grave nor would that hinder Us in any way but we would be we would become forth out of that grave to meet our Lord in the air and and so they they had a a a promise that they were given and also the other thing about it that was so far is that they were elected they were chosen to be the children of God they were elected to have a land they were elected to receive a son and and I I just thought in my heart this morning you know look at us this morning and for the young people I think that that we we have what we call the Bible but what is the Bible the Bible if you could look at it this way it's a book of History it's a it's a a a a a recording and of of the the journey that God's people has taken it it tells them the trials they've been through it tells them the discouragements they've had the the battles that they fought the things that came up against them you can sit here and you can see looking at this you can see a persevering people who that God that the god preserved when so many tried to wipe them out that nothing could pluck them out of the palm of his hand that he had put his heart towards his people me and he kept every word to him he said if you go astray he said I'll take my hand off you if you repent I'll take you back but I'll never leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end I want this morning for all of us to understand that who were these people what type of people were they what was it that they had and for us to sit back this morning and realize we are like these people they are a type of us what made them is what makes us what they've been through is what we go through what their promise was is our promise there's not a lot of difference they were marked separated out marked by circumcision in the natural being a natural type and we're mark we're marked by our circumcision our separation from the world not that we condemn that's not our purpose to condemn we don't condemn those that drink we don't drink we don't condemn those that smoke we might condemn smoking but the world itself condemns smoking they'll put a sticker on it that says I want you to know that this product is harmful for your health it may cause cancer or might even say may does con that don't stop them you know we just just don't stop them they go right past that but we don't condemn that we don't do it people listen to all kinds of music we don't condemn it I mean it's as a person that listens to it but we don't listen to it we're we're circumcised spiritually by separation from the world so our Mark is the life of Holiness that we lead we're and we're elected each one of us has been elected and called and even for when we realize that in coming to this great message that we come to Faith is is a revelation Abraham had the Revelation that the god that spoke to him was going to do what he said and when those three men came and appeared to him he recognized that one there was something about that one that that signified out and when we know these great stories but you know in order for us to go forward even our young people and and like I've always said if you're young enough to go to school and learn algebra and learn all the capitals of this States and all the river and the rivers and the geography do they still teach geography okay good because nowadays you don't know what they teach but you're they're old enough to learn that they're old enough to to you know do this technology and all those things certainly they're old enough to understand what causes us to be a people because there was a man that came that was interested in the welfare of the elected Church that there was a message for this day that has come and you know you just can't sit back and try to teach your children to live right and and to uh you know don't do this don't do that we don't wear this you dress this way you dress that way without ever understanding and sitting down and explaining to them what makes us the way that we are and even when the children of Israel came out and they celebrated the Passover one of the very heritages of these people this people called Israel was they shared their story from every generation to every generation that the parents sat down with the children and they told them about how they came out of Israel how they were held in captivity the reason that we're celebrating this is because the night that the death angel passed over and and you look at each of our individual testimonies my testimony is the death angel passed over me the death angel of sin the death angel of the life that I was living in the death angel that could have taken me in any time by the grace of God that death passed over me and there was blood put on the doorpost of my life and they shared that story they sat down and said do you understand the reason that we are the way we are because Moses came we were in captivity and Moses came and was interested in our welfare every Jesus came because he was interested in our welfare Nehemiah came because he was interested in our welfare you know that's a sign that was to follow the church that they would know that ye are my disciples because of your interest in the welfare of another it was it was a became an identifying mark why are we the people we're in captivity do you realize that right now Christianity right now we are we are living in a world that doesn't want us we are living in a world that doesn't want to teach the god that we serve we are living in a world that wants to keep what keep so many things from us we can't go and hardly go anyplace anymore without without it just being so unbelievable what what what's allowed to go on around us truly I would say that we're in Sodom and Gomorrah so I'm not just not going to do any good to try to get our children to understand and to go forward and to embrace what we're embracing if we never sit down and explain to them what caused us because we received an Abraham in our day we received a Nehemiah in our day we received the Lord in our day we receive the Moses in our day we received a message from God that's that's the foundation that's what made these people Israel they were separated out and they let their children know that that they were elected young people when I say young people I say eight years old I don't I don't know what Young is anymore everybody's looking young to me but you can understand that you're elected that God put you in this family that you're in that that that you have a part of it you were a part of him that we live the way that we live because of what's coming to the world we live the way we live because we've been called out not to be partakers of the Judgment that's coming we we we we we live the way we live because of what that we've heard and you look at the people look at it in Israel these children of Israel they were they they live by a law they live by a word that was different and we live by a word that's different we're not we we're not conformed but we're transformed we we've been called out we've been separated we don't walk just like Israel was elected called out and separated and given a land to dwell in this is what we've got to start communicating and understanding that we all have this in common every single one of the children in Israel had one thing in common they were The Offspring of Abraham and they bore the mark in their body of that of that the children of Abraham had they were chosen and elected and despised and the reproach was there in other words the approach meant that the feelings of disapproval they were surrounded by the field the feelings of disapproval and resentment people hated them they did people might be friendly but their spirits cried out against them and we are this people we we are this People Israel okay you you would think that that we would be free to raise our children the way that we want to raise our children but you know that is trying to be robbed from us I I couldn't believe it a brother shared with me he said you won't believe this so he sends me the link and and there's States and and different groups of lawmakers and cities and different things they want to be able to take your child and I forget whatever they call it something about trans gender uh thing and they want to be able to if if you're if your boy thinks he's a girl you know not that it's a mental problem and you think well could that be a mental problem yeah there are spirits out there church don't sit around and think that them Spirits aren't going to get on your kids they're going to come and talk to your daughters they're going to talk to them and say oh maybe I'm gay they're going to talk to your young men maybe I'm gay or I'm feeling this way that he is the author of confusion and that's why there's gender confusion and they created the confusion by creating such a lukewarm environment that men and women aren't separated and God's always been a separator he's always separated light from Darkness he's always made clear paths but when you delude it so bad that there's no more lines of Distinction there's no more definitions there's no more guidelines it just becomes a big Melting Pot of anything and you don't think those those confusions are are going to come oh say no question everything he'll question your marriage you'll question whether you married the right one you'll question does she love me does she not love me does she cook is she trying to poison them you know what I mean it don't matter because that's what he does he goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and they want to be able to to create the confusion in your child's mind by not teaching them what a Mahala man treats a woman and they'll think of the whole my goodness if I said a woman belongs in the kitchen my goodness gracious uh I get taken right off YouTube I mean that used to be a common thing you used to be able to preach a woman belongs at home a woman needs to raise her children if they can afford it so what do they do they make everything so expensive I'm trying to tell you we are in captivity we might not think that but they want to take this kid without telling you foreign and train them how to make the transition they want to teach gender transition without the parents knowing it this is the Captivity you live in and if you ignore it it'll be on your doorstep and if you ignore it on your doorstep it'll be in your house and one day one of your kids is going to come up and say Mommy I want to be a boy and you're going to wonder where in the world did you get that from well mommy well your head was in the ground like an ostrich these people over here were showing me that I'd be a better boy Than a Woman oh don't you think that it's not going to affect you or don't you think that it gets your responsibility to care about the welfare of the church of Israel the children of Israel the children of God we are in a captivity now we are in a time in a society where the Angel of Darkness who is the power of the air the principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places is what we are fighting and it's trying to rob us of our very sense of decency to where now if we draw a line we're the criminal worthy immoral one we're the one that doesn't have love so it's no longer God first foreign loyalty to our heritage and and in this great book of Nehemiah that's one of the things that we begin to understand is that they were concerned about their heritage they were concerned about what they were built on they were concerned about their election they were concerned about the law and the word that they live by the keeping the Sabbath keeping the holy days keeping the dress codes keeping the sacrifices that meant something to them doesn't mean something to us they don't want to stay too long on that but that's got me fired up the welfare of the children of Israel now we know that Nehemiah went back because he was concerned about the conditions and we don't need to go we went through that earlier how that he went out and he went by night and he looked at everything and everything and I I looked something up and I I sat back and I I couldn't believe it so I was going to say I'm not going to read this because I don't know if I believe it myself so I asked my phone you know that lady that knows everything I never thought I'd find anybody that knew any better than what I knew right but boy she she'll tell you right quick I said how long was the wall that Nehemiah built does anybody have an active phone I know you all turn them off you have a phone on you okay good will you asking so I asked how long is the wall that Nehemiah built around Jerusalem and this little box told me that it was 4 000 and 18 meters I thought all right then I read the next line and they said it was 2 497 miles oh good 2.497 miles is that what it is 2.4 miles that's a lot of miles all right and it was eight feet thick I think it was 12 feet tall something like that like I said I don't have my thing I I looked at it I didn't believe it let me put it down but the amazing thing is it took 52 days to build 52 days to build let's read here in Nehemiah if we could down to the 17th verse and it says here he says then said I unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach you know there there was a a purpose for a wall and that's what we see what the the whole the whole voice of society now is no walls no walls we have free range that you can marry whoever you want to marry no we've got walls we don't interracially married it's not our heritage that ain't black against white that isn't frowned against yellow or pink against Blue that's none of that that's our inheritance each one of us God made us special made us elected he chose us what we would be there's not one people greater than another people well that's worldly nonsense that's economy that's Satan's division we don't have that division we live The Way We Live By God's word we got walls and when the walls are down there's no distinction there's no separation so and and what does a wall do a wall does two things it keeps people out and it keeps things in and we need to start having walls in our life we we build walls that are reproach it separates us from mixing in your own personal life you've got to have lines you've got to have walls you've got to have things you don't do we teach our young girls we don't smooch and kiss and Huggy buggy and all that stuff before marriage that's why we don't watch TV why we kick it out of our house parents plop those kids in front of those TVs and they just get all these cartoons and all this violence I forget not long ago there was a study that if a child watches two hours of cartoons in the morning they'll see I don't know if it was two or three or thousand acts of violence one character hitting the other one and carrying and throwing something in their face and all this hahaha slap stick comedy it's what what are we countering it with you've got to build a wall around your children when you have all these get-togethers and you let all your kids all run upstairs and all of them hang out and all the little kids and all the little boys Gary and everything well you better make sure they're not up there playing doctor oh would we'd rather talk about the Mysteries right we don't want to talk about Sin we don't want to talk about what the enemy's trying to do but the prophet of God said you will never become an invincible Army until you recognize the devil and every single one of his tricks you say you're talking about parents no I'm talking about teenagers I'm talking about young men your conversation the things you look at the places you go what kind of communication are you having with somebody you got to have walls you've got to have lines that you draw you've got to have places that you you stand up for because that's what keeps the approach out no you can't if you don't have a wall then you're subject to whatever feelings or disapproval or acknowledgment you have what is it caring whether the world likes me or not I want to follow this word I want to follow this message I don't want to let down the bars I don't want to let things I don't want to let Satan in I want to build things in my life blocks of virtue blocks of Good Works a pattern of Good Works things that I do habits that I have things that I engage in that build a wall around me and a hedge around me and keep him out and keep what I want in my life in why we read our Bible we read our Bible you can't read the message without reading the Bible because the message tells you to read the Bible you will never know that you have a scriptural message without seeing the message in the Bible our messenger took everything that he taught and he brought it back and he said it's right here but it's been sealed up and part of our part of what we received in this day was a man that was concerned for the church because the church didn't have any walls and because it didn't have any walls the goats were getting in and the goats were breeding with the sheep and it was producing a hybrid and he knew that in order to get this we got to separate them out we've got to call the elected out we have to have them circumcise their lives with holiness we've got to give them a word to live by an indwelling spirit or a revelation because the church is built on Revelation it's built on the people who has received the Revelation that God sent a man that was concerned about Israel and concerned about them Hallelujah we would have never been where we are this morning without William branley none of us are holy enough none of us are smart enough none of us are anointed enough it's like a man sent from the King to build the walls up in our life so we wouldn't have the reproach of the world on us we're a people we're not a religion we're inherited one to another we're part of one another our names were written on the book together we're brothers and sisters we have a culture of Our Own We Care One for another we're an elected people because God was going to have a people in this day that he was going to build into a statue of a perfect man that he was going to cap them off with Divine love and that they were going to be living and walking on this world as he walked in this world and they had separated themselves out that's why we believe the message because it's the truth so there had to be walls and that's what he said he said then I said unto them ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth and waste what was Jerusalem Jerusalem was what they say to that they called it the city that God dwelt in we're talking in type right what what are we going to where are we going to live we're going to live in the what the New Jerusalem the city that comes down the city that John saw well there's not going to be day or night but he will be the light of the city it was a type of something that needed to be protected I'm asking you today are you protecting yourself husbands are you protecting your family young men are you protecting the sisters children are you protecting one another you understand you've got to protect you young sisters when you came to that 13 14 years old and boys start coming into your life I don't know why that happens but anyway and you got all that stuff going on in your life don't get back protect one another is some guy from the outside the wall starts flashing his big blue eyes at you you reach over to your sister huh he might be cute on the outside but in the inside he don't want to do nothing but to you but mess you up you say oh that's pretty strong preaching for Sunday morning look at he's doing it every day in the schoolyard he's doing it every day on the internet he's doing it every day don't think that you don't think how bad it is we thought they've got so much trouble on the internet with people getting in these chats and these texts older men running off with young girl pedophilers everywhere perversion everywhere you better build the wall [Applause] you can't lay in ruin if there's Rubble Build It Up he says let us build he says burn fresh he's come let us build up the walls of Jerusalem let us build up our protection let us Build It Up that there's no more reproach that we don't appear as hypocrites we've drawn a clear line on what side of the wall we're going to live on where not everything can come in not everything comes in prophet of God preached a wonderful sermon on that called thinking men's filter the word filters that stuff out that sin nicotine that sin cancer he says I saw that he said the spirit said go pick it up he said I ain't picking that thing up and he went back and he picked it up said a thinking man's filter he said a man that smokes these isn't thinking at all you need to put some of these thoughts in your mind young girls protect one another encourage one another if you you know let one another know they look you look nice you look cute today that looks good that looks good on you be honest with one another that's a little tight I can see your I was going to use a different word underwear is that come on come on we're a people we're a family we might as well forget that we've got any division if we die we're all gonna die if we go we're all gonna go that's what Abraham said I'm gonna go get locked he belongs to me let's take our plows and build them into swords let's go get the elect if we can't be honest we're not like the world ashamed to use certain words I can't even say he or she we say Shem how about it oh you can't do it you got to be careful you got to walk on pins and needles you think Jesus walked on pins and needles he's sitting at a feast all the rich rulers and everything all around right in the middle of the feast he jumps up and he says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest well they built walls let's just read this the next verse and he said then I told them of the hand of God which was good unto me as also the king's word that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for the good work in others they started making provisions you know it's just like you come to church and something that says and they put you under conviction or the Lord corrects you and you're going to say well I'm going to go make that right and the first time that someone invites you out for a Sonic hot dog that's gone the conviction lasts to the four-year it's not taken deep inside another you strengthen yourself they strengthen themselves to build they made Provisions they made changes they they when they said we're gonna build well they knew they had to go sharpen their chisels they had to go get their tools they had to rearrange their schedules they had to make they strengthened themselves in other words they made their life where they could do what they had purpose to do if you don't strengthen your life to make full proof of your ministry for you to follow the calling wherein God called you you know you can fool people with your personality so long you can fool people with your education but the elect knows when you're saying what the prophet says the elect knows when you're making up your own stuff it don't impress me [Music] in ought not to impress you either there ought to be one voice that impresses you and that's a voice of God I I've listened to all kinds of anointing preachers I ain't seen one of them yet that can turn us back to the audience or say I see you right here that's what I follow that's what we follow because we've had a man come that was concerned about the bride Israel well we're anchoring you make Provisions to strengthen yourself you strengthen your home have family altar read the Bible together talk about the scripture listen to tapes you got to strengthen yourself what are you building what are you building when you get married you better find out right away what are you building me and Leslie had to make a decision what are we going to do we could have stayed where we're at I could have got a job and raised a family if and and prospered I could have went with them worked with my father and had a great portion of business there's a lot of things we could have done but we chose to move here and start a little work for the kingdom and we strengthen ourselves for the work we went through the thick and thin of it well we we had service where we had the piano player my family and one other person I know it is like to have three people show up to church they're not talking to me I'm talking about anybody that strengthens their life for the work they build the wall you know how there was 34 Towers on the wall 34 places that they looked out and they watched for the enemy not only did they watch out but they watched in do you have any Towers in your life you have any places that you get out there and you look out the welfare of your brothers how are they doing is somebody going through marriage trouble is somebody going through financial trouble and then you look out here and say oh the enemy's coming the enemy's coming all the time we know that if God don't watch the city we watch in vain the message without life is theology it's theology the word without manifestation is theology if the word don't become flesh it's just theology everybody's got theology we got theologians like you can't believe I like Paul he said I didn't come to you with enticing words of men or education I never use my education as Vindication that I know this and that because I've got a PhD he said one thing he said I was taught in the school of gamalia as a Pharisee you know perfect in every way and you know what I'd count it all he says I count it all as done for the kingdom of God without Revelation it doesn't do me one good thing you'll never impress somebody that's uneducated with their education because they wonder why you went through all that in the first place really I know a lot of people that make more money than doctors make because they know how to run a shovel or run a bulldozer I'm not against education just because I don't have any don't make that I don't have anything that's why when you want to talk with me let's talk about the word then I don't have to talk about other stuff I don't want to talk about other stuff 34 Towers in this wall that's something huh man I can't believe 52 days you think they had a mind to work you think they strengthen themselves to get the job done we could get a lot more done in our spiritual lives if we would strengthen our hand to work you want to grow spiritually set aside time to read your Bible set aside time to read a book set a time aside for Fellowship set aside a time for prayer but if you don't strengthen yourself to the work you don't have the endurance to get through and you know while you're young and you've got the strength work hard get as far away from the world as you can because when you get older you don't have the strength that you used to have you better have built yourself a lifestyle that's so far away from the world that you can't be sucked back into it because you've got no desire for it you've got no association with it you've got no openings no places to return to it you haven't left a provision for you to go back to the world you don't have an Escape Plan we know about the Escape Plan what were they called The Escape planist ananias and Sapphira they had an Escape Plan why lie to the Holy Spirit you don't think he knows if you're not sincere you don't think he knows if you don't want to live this life you don't think he knows you're looking for a way out and again to young people you don't understand what I believe you don't understand what makes me the way I am come talk to me ask your parents can I go talk to Mother McGarry I have some questions I'd like to ask them I'd like to know the scripture or sit down and talk to your dad or your mom wouldn't it be some some teenager comes up and says mom and dad I'd like to talk to you but you're so backslid no they wouldn't say that because they're good kids that their brain might be going a mile a minute you want to pop that TV up in front of your kid shame on you amen you ain't got no wall you might as well open the door say Mr devil please come in at my house and pervert my children Billy Graham screamed out against I Love Lucy you know why she was The Voice for the independence of women in America she did what she wanted to do she lied and schemed and made her husband look like a fool wives never never never talk about your husbands never never never never never never talk about your husbands to another sister whatever he's done wrong talking about it is five times the evil never expose his weakness never expose your discontent don't ever do it it's poison build a wall Bridle the tongue be sincere always remember you're the one who married them husbands likewise love your wives as Christ loved the church protector keep things out don't let stuff in don't make her your part partner in backsliding young men before you get married you better have these principles down in your life you ought to know exactly what you're going to do for her exactly how you're going to take care of her and I'm not saying you've got to get a college degree before you can get married I don't know who instilled that in people I was Dumber in a fence post when Leslie married me and then she taught me a few things these are things we got to have down now amen because we're going forward so and so we got to strengthen their hands for the work they yeah and they were sure they were laughed at they were mocked why is the world going to do it because the world don't do it you know what the world's plan is for everything divorce we put 20 years into a marriage 15 years into a marriage five I mean if you put a five months into a marriage it's worth working on it's worth keeping it's worth sitting down and let's find out you can't let two minds grow up in a household you can't have two different Minds a double-minded man is unstable in all its ways if you're having conflict you got to sit down you got to get on the same page you got to find out what your objectives are what are we doing here I'm your help mate I'm here to help you husband in this world that's wicked out there I'm here for you we don't have this conversation you stay home dear and do the dishes because I'm going to go pursue my career you got two different Minds that's the world out there it's a world that got us to work on Sundays it's a world that's God is still look everything Through The Eyes of dollar bills and finance but we're we're surrounding Jerusalem We're The Dwelling Place of the Living God this is where God dwells in this hour is in the flesh of his bride it was the word made flesh now it's flesh being made word we're a people that in this last day is supposed to be Capstone and having the very love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit that's the kind of people we are loving caring and if we start letting these things slip it's because our Wall's not built and I'll be the first to say I had lots of holes in my walls and my kids suffered a lot of things from it because I didn't have the understanding there wasn't a voice that cried out then I'd like to finish this morning with the first verse of the third chapter School and we know the 20th verse of the last chapter all these guys wanted to come and help them the minute they saw they were serious they wanted part of the action and this is what he said then answered by them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us amen the god of Heaven he will prosper us he will prosper the bride he'll Prosper your lives we're looking out after one another we're carrying one for another we're praying one for another we're building the walls we're recognizing that we're a people we're teaching our children where we come from why the way we are we're telling them about the pillar of fire we're telling them about the cloud we're telling them about the church ages we're telling them about the opening of the seals right amen and he said he says God will prosper us therefore we his servants will rise and build we his servants where this is not nickelatianism I am not going to make this journey without you I cannot Bear all the spiritual burden by myself I can't pray for everybody I can't visit everybody in fact we are all called to lay hands on the sick we are all called that cast out demons my calling is to preach the gospel I have a very general Outlook of the path and direction of the church I don't try to mingle in your lives but if you need to know whether you should eat this because it's poison or not or eat that that's what the shepherd does he keeps the Wolves Away he keeps the voices away he keeps the lies away he tries to keep you on the straight and narrow no matter what's going on to the right or left no matter what shouts are and what camp you've got to set your mind Straight Ahead this is the message this is the voice we follow this is what we're about you can hear it just the same as I can hear it I love the scripture where Paul says take this epistle and let it be read in all the churches we have our epistle today the Epistle of our age is those tapes and the scriptures he said let it be red let it be played in all the churches not just the homes all the church that's the word of the Lord go read it for yourself that's what he said the anointings on the tapes we're not trying to keep the anointing out of the church we're trying to get the anointing in the church we're trying to get the anointing for this hour into the church and the anointing of this hour is that the works that I do you shall do also not the service not the church service not the camp meeting which it's good that it's there I'm all for it I love praising the Lord praise God I love it amen I love to run if we could we have Jericho mouches today if we wasn't tripping over the chairs but it's you now we're going to close then then a Eli Smith the high priest rose up with his brethren the priest and they built the Sheep gate and sacrificed it and set up the doors of it even unto the tower of mihai they sacrificed it unto the Tower of him anilia and I thought this was very tremendous to me and it struck me that if we would type Jerusalem to the church right to the people that we are to the Heritage and inheritance that we have the first thing they built was the Sheep gate and I thought isn't that really the first thing when the Lord built his church that he built was the gate for the Sheep to come in the first thing we build in our lives is Christian is the Sheep gate we build a gate or we build an entrance that people can come in and hear and receive what we have to offer in your in your family life in your raising of your family in your lifestyle you should always have a gate open in your life that people can enter in and hear of the fellowship and the hope that you have in your heart when you're on school and you go to school your life ought to have a gate in it a sheep gate where someone that has troubles or someone that has trials or somebody that needs prayer that that you have a a gate that's open that welcomes them in sometimes we button up our lives so tight that nobody knows where you are what you're thinking where you've been where you're going and who you are and who you're with and anything else I missed we don't have any entrance into our feelings no entrance into our burdens we've got we got our lives so shut up that we find him on the outside knocking to try to come in all of our Lives ought to have an open gate in it somewhere the first thing he built was the Sheep gate a place for people to come in a place for the Sheep to come in a place that they could come into the safety of the wall that's being built the first gate was the Sheep gate I thought that was significant I thought I thought how important it is that the first thing he said is go into all the world and preach the gospel make an entrance for him and I thought you know what I know we're building this church over here that's good you'll have more room to see it if you'll have more bathrooms to use you'll have more doors to escape by all those things are good but if we don't have an entrance for lost sheep if we don't have a spirit that invites those from without to be able to come in and taste of the transforming power of God the gate is an attitude the gate is in atmosphere the gate is a heartbeat that you've freely received and you freely want to give a gate the Sheep gate has no judgment in it we don't accept sin we're not against The Sinner we're against the devil that has them in captivity and we want them to know that there's a gate open there's a gate in fact I think it's beautiful let's just turn in closing to Peter second Peter I believe it's 111. this is after Peter talks about this the Great statue of a perfect man he comes down and he comes to the 10th verse he says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling an election sure and there's give diligence to Build That Wall in your life that makes your election and calling sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall what a promise are you fallen all the time are you stumbling all the time the minute something comes on you're just so curious It's got such a draw in your flesh that you just keep stumbling for it and you find those times in your life you don't have nothing going on so your mind starts going wild and the devil's in there building bird nests and all that stuff you got to strengthen yourself for the work you got to say I got to fight that thing I'm going to grab my Bible I'm going to press a book I'm going to pray I'm going to I'm going to turn away I'm going to make an effort I'm in a fight I'm going to add virtue I'm going to build on my faith I'm going to add these things in my life he says you'll never fall Hallelujah we're a people that can come to the place that we don't fall and when he tries to come in we push him back we possess the gates of our enemy we can do that he doesn't have to rule us he doesn't have to defeat us we can drive sickness out we can play claim to our children our kids can get the spirit of God and know it's real with or without sensation even though the mystery for this age is to be able to receive the Holy Spirit without sensation why because it's coming from within that seed within is sprouting up by Revelation but live what Peter says he says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling in the election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall for an entrance shall be ministered unto unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ an entrance has been ministered to us a sheep gate has been ministered to us that we can come into the everlasting life and presence of Our Lord isn't that a beautiful scripture abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of Our Lord that Kingdom's here there's been an entrance been made there's been a man that's come who was interested in the welfare of the church and he made an entrance for us to enter in at that gate into the Everlasting kingdom of God and it has been freely given freely give the first thing they made was the gate that those without could come in and eat of the Tree of Life oh my not only do we have to have that gate as a church but we have to have that gate as an individual is that gate nailed shut with embarrassment is it nailed shut with what people think have they nailed it shut with reproach don't be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the power of God for salvation it's been freely given to you he made an entrance for you that's why you show people the gate this is the way in repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's a way there's an entrance you're on the outside you want to be on the inside you want to invite him into the kingdom you want to invite him into the city an entrance has been made for us just think no matter where you're at there's an entrance made for you this morning that you can come in and he knows what you have need of even before you asked I I just thought that was marvelous the first thing that they built the priest they built the Sheep gate to where the sacrifice and the offering and the life could come the Forgiveness of sins aren't you glad for the Forgiveness of sins our righteousness is as filthy rags but his righteousness is life and peace and I close with this this morning who were these people Israel who was this People Israel they were the elect children of God Bound by captivity surrounded by the world and yet built wall to keep the reproach out and they shared that Glory only to the Lord because the Lord is the provider the Lord is my strength his rod and his staff they comfort me though I go through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil he's real he loves you and you have a part to play and nobody can take your place you've decide whether you're going to serve God or not make strengthen yourself in the work maybe go to bed at 10 o'clock instead of two o'clock in the morning you know don't say I'm in Fellowship all night long come early to church 30 minutes early and pray and get in the spirit clear your mind open your home to Fellowship look around and make sure who's not being invited who's not being talked to what about have concerned one for another like the man that had concerned be real Christians Amen Let the love of God be shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit open a gate in your life that people can come in and you can freely give share what you have be christ-like because
