[0:14] it might look kind of funny this morning
[0:16] to wear my Overcoat on the platform but
[0:19] I was so happy that
[0:21] to display that pretty Overcoat this
[0:23] shirts give me I seen brother Neville up
[0:26] here to the day with that nice suit on
[0:28] hot fitting so nicely and I thought well
[0:30] uh he looks nice in the congregation
[0:33] talking about I thought I'll just wear
[0:35] my Overcoat out on the back hey man
[0:39] you know I believe we never grow up we
[0:42] always and I don't want to grow up how
[0:45] about that brother Luther
[0:47] now I never want to grow up we just want
[0:49] to always remain children
[0:54] one of those tires like these higher
[0:57] Christ ministers I just glanced part of
[0:59] my eye and I thought maybe you just put
[1:01] all the rules
[1:04] complimentary to that nice Overcoat well
[1:07] I'll say it's it's I was needing one
[1:10] awful bad and it's the best one I ever
[1:13] had and I sure do appreciate it and
[1:16] brother Roy Roberson I don't know where
[1:18] he's here this morning or not he had
[1:19] something to do with the selecting of it
[1:22] and it was really a fine selection and
[1:25] we're we're very very pleased to have it
[1:30] and so
[1:31] we are very pleased to be back in the
[1:34] house of the Living God this morning and
[1:37] to enjoy these wonderful times of
[1:40] Fellowship around his precious word
[1:45] and it's soon now that the Lord willing
[1:48] I've got to go overseas I guess you've
[1:52] seen it in the businessman's voice that
[1:55] I leave for overseas this next month
[1:58] and we will be soliciting all the
[2:01] prayers of the people that they will
[2:04] pray for us while we are
[2:06] away
[2:08] seemingly that oversees my meeting seems
[2:12] to be uh better because it takes Federal
[2:17] there in America
[2:21] was telling brother Mercer that I'll
[2:23] listen to her he gave me a record player
[2:26] first
[2:27] and it had the records on it of some of
[2:30] my sermons
[2:33] I knew that if anybody ever listened to
[2:36] me would have to be God's grace to them
[2:39] because I thought I could be a little
[2:42] better he's Taping that too a little you
[2:45] can cut that part out or he's holding
[2:48] his thumb down I guess that's cutting it
[2:49] off but I I tell you I was so surprised
[2:54] I uh poorest preaching I ever heard in
[2:57] my life was my own that's right on on
[3:00] the record I it made me so nervous I
[3:02] couldn't even eat my dinner I got sick
[3:04] got away at the table couldn't sleep
[3:06] that night and uh went out in Kentucky
[3:09] with brother wood just you coming back I
[3:11] said brother Woods I don't see how that
[3:14] I ever get a person to come and hear me
[3:16] speak as so so poorly such repeating
[3:21] myself and all grammar Miss and
[3:25] punctuations there isn't isn't any I
[3:27] just
[3:28] I don't know I said they encouraged me
[3:31] in one way to know it has to be God or
[3:33] nobody would come at all that's right so
[3:36] I was speaking to brother Collins I
[3:39] suppose he's in the building and so I
[3:41] said to him he come over and he's
[3:43] telling him about it I said brother
[3:45] Collins uh honestly I said I'm pregnant
[3:48] 30 years old as a preacher and I
[3:51] certainly ought to know what a sermon is
[3:53] I said that's the poorest I ever heard
[3:55] any he's the Methodist Minister and his
[3:59] brothers are quite a man in the
[4:02] Methodist denomination and he said well
[4:04] he said I'll tell you brother Branham
[4:06] said the punctuations and and your
[4:10] sentences made out of the end right and
[4:11] things like that but so did you ever
[4:13] think of that guy preached on the day of
[4:15] Pentecost they couldn't even sign his
[4:17] own name name his name is Peter said I
[4:20] imagine that wasn't punctuated just
[4:22] right
[4:24] but you see what makes a man get his
[4:27] eyes on that you listen to these radio
[4:29] broadcasts and that's all rodents you
[4:31] see and they they can't even write it
[4:33] out and punctuate it and things because
[4:35] they're reading it I stood but Charles
[4:37] Fuller preaching behind a trough about
[4:40] like Ed Free's platform and everything
[4:42] that he said he read it write down
[4:43] number one number two number three
[4:45] number four I can't figure out all right
[4:47] out and timed it is all censored radio
[4:50] censored everything because and with
[4:52] Billy Graham I seen his and so forth
[4:55] where they just stand there and speak
[4:57] that just as read it just as fast as
[4:59] they can read it and it's all right so I
[5:01] guess you would get the punctuations but
[5:03] the trouble with me I couldn't even read
[5:05] it so
[5:06] if I wrote it I'm sure I couldn't read
[5:08] it so
[5:10] so it's Amazing Grace isn't it to see
[5:14] what he can do for us but I'm grateful
[5:17] to starting in now ending up to this old
[5:20] year
[5:22] to start a new year I listened to a
[5:24] prayer line and I certainly wasn't
[5:26] satisfied with the prayer line either
[5:28] The Listener that's first time I ever
[5:30] heard myself back like that for for a
[5:32] message
[5:33] and I certainly was surprised the prayer
[5:37] lines isn't run right
[5:38] no I think it'll come to pass that after
[5:41] a while it'll be so that everybody will
[5:43] have to know everything about them
[5:44] before they'll believe and beginning and
[5:48] first year I want to change that and
[5:49] you'll start the prayer line wherever
[5:51] God speaks to me this person's out of
[5:54] line or something wrong I'll stop with
[5:56] him let the rest of them go on through
[5:58] that because you don't get enough
[5:59] through like that see the prayer people
[6:01] know where they are and who they are and
[6:03] what they've done but they find
[6:04] something it's not lined up just right
[6:07] with God that's a time to stop on that
[6:09] one say this is the one
[6:11] so I think maybe to be some alternation
[6:14] done brother the old since I heard them
[6:17] and I trust that God will help us in the
[6:21] coming year now I believe that tonight
[6:24] they got Services here at the Tabernacle
[6:26] and I'm to be up here on 62 with brother
[6:29] ruddle tonight
[6:31] I understand that they're going to have
[6:33] a watch service here and brother ruddle
[6:37] had asked me for that watch service but
[6:39] thinking maybe I'd come back at the
[6:40] Tabernacle for that night because of
[6:43] always tried to be at the Tabernacle on
[6:46] on uh New Year's Eve and I wanted to
[6:50] come back down here with the brother in
[6:52] here so I kind of compromised a little
[6:55] and of abuse brother ruddle tonight out
[6:57] on 62.
[6:59] at the old 62 Club that's been converted
[7:02] into a
[7:04] church and then Wednesday night will be
[7:08] back here at the watch service and then
[7:12] Thursday we leave for Chicago and then
[7:15] on and on to Philadelphia and then
[7:17] overseas
[7:19] and this morning we don't want to keep
[7:21] you too long because it's uh we got um
[7:25] interviews and the services go on and
[7:28] say since the last prayer service Euro
[7:30] I'm very grateful for the results it
[7:33] came forth from the last service of
[7:36] Prayer it was certainly a wonderful
[7:39] thing that our Lord can do when his
[7:41] people get together they that are will
[7:44] call upon the name of the Lord assemble
[7:46] themselves together I believe is the way
[7:48] it is and and prayed and God will hear
[7:51] from heaven
[7:53] so let us bow our heads just a moment
[7:55] now as we look to him to give to us the
[8:00] inspiration needed for this message
[8:04] Lord thou has been our refuge and
[8:08] strength and all generations
[8:11] our forefathers before us trusted in
[8:14] thee and were not confounded
[8:17] they believed in thy holy name and they
[8:20] were brought forth as shining lights
[8:26] and we looking upon them as the Portis
[8:29] said Footprints upon the sands of time
[8:33] our partings leave behind us footprints
[8:37] on the sands of time
[8:39] then we see that those who trusted in
[8:42] thee all ways without one time failing
[8:46] come out right
[8:48] though they went through many deep
[8:51] Waters and and great trials and
[8:54] persecutions but yet in the end thou did
[8:58] all ways bring them out more than
[9:02] conquerors
[9:03] because it is I promised word that you
[9:07] would do this
[9:09] and we would pray today that you would
[9:12] bless this little church
[9:15] blessed Pastor our good brother brother
[9:18] Neville and his family we ask that
[9:22] you'll just be with him in this coming
[9:25] year and will anoint him greater and and
[9:29] bless him in every way
[9:32] strengthen the health of his family the
[9:35] little ones that are coming up
[9:38] keep brother Neville strong and healthy
[9:41] and bless this church and every member
[9:44] that's in it the trustee board how we
[9:47] love them is real Gallant man of God and
[9:51] the Deacon board they also are thy
[9:54] Gallant servants and all the people that
[9:57] come here we are grateful for them Lord
[10:01] just does my heart good to know that
[10:03] this little old Pond and weed patch
[10:06] standing on the corner many years ago
[10:09] has been made a lighthouse
[10:13] to the kingdom of God
[10:16] and I pray God that it'll stand until
[10:19] Jesus comes
[10:22] May many great Souls that's been in here
[10:25] Lord
[10:26] come forth at that day washed in the
[10:29] blood of the Lamb
[10:31] granted and as we open
[10:34] this blessed word of thine this morning
[10:37] Lord by turning back the pages to read
[10:40] from it a text
[10:43] and we know that you alone can give the
[10:45] context and we pray God that you will
[10:48] anoint your word
[10:50] may it go right to the hearts of the
[10:53] people that would do them good make
[10:56] Believers out of unbelievers
[10:58] and strengthen Christians and heal the
[11:01] sick give courage to the discouraged and
[11:06] get Glory unto thyself in order to do
[11:09] this Lord circumcise the lips that shall
[11:12] speak in the ears that shall hear for we
[11:15] asked it in Jesus name
[11:17] amen
[11:18] [Music]
[11:22] announcing
[11:24] a little text that a fell on my heart
[11:27] since last Sunday
[11:30] that I was speaking up on the wise man
[11:33] coming to
[11:35] to see Jesus the star they followed from
[11:38] the East to the West
[11:41] while studying then I hit a scripture
[11:43] and then
[11:44] did not get to be your Christmas Eve
[11:47] because of some jail service and so
[11:49] forth I had to be at I thought I would
[11:52] speak today upon the subject of why
[11:56] little Bethlehem
[12:00] and I want to read out of the Book of
[12:02] Micah the prophet one of the Minor
[12:05] Prophets
[12:06] the fifth chapter
[12:08] and the second verse
[12:12] it reads like this
[12:15] but thou Bethlehem Ephraim
[12:18] though thou be little among the
[12:22] thousands of Judah
[12:24] but out yet out of these shall come
[12:29] forth unto me
[12:32] and eat
[12:37] a ruler be the ruler in Israel who's
[12:41] going forth has been from old from
[12:45] Everlasting
[12:48] I had a spot on the scripture there so
[12:51] he I couldn't make out what the word was
[12:52] at the time
[12:57] of all of the places that is in
[13:02] Palestine
[13:05] and in
[13:08] there is so many great cities
[13:13] and its localities
[13:16] cities that are seemingly much more
[13:21] uh no one in the lore of History
[13:28] and better
[13:31] fortified
[13:33] bigger cities
[13:35] why should God choose little Bethlehem
[13:40] to be the birthplace of his son
[13:46] there is many that are greater
[13:49] and
[13:51] for instance the historical Aura of
[13:54] Jerusalem the proud Jerusalem the
[13:58] capital of all of it
[14:02] and it's one of the largest cities of
[14:05] Palestine
[14:07] and then we wonder why God would pick on
[14:10] that little bitty Town of Bethlehem
[14:15] for the birthplace of his son
[14:19] but as the scriptures is said what God
[14:23] determines to do it will be done
[14:28] and there is uh God for ordained it to
[14:32] be that way
[14:34] or it never would have been that way
[14:37] and there the scripture says in the 15th
[14:40] chapter of acts that there is nothing by
[14:45] chance
[14:47] God knowed everything
[14:51] it just didn't happen to happen that way
[14:54] it just was that God made it that way
[15:00] and then when we in our little finite
[15:03] Minds begin to
[15:05] think over why would the great king of
[15:09] Heaven
[15:11] choose a little place like that instead
[15:14] of the capital
[15:18] and instead of some even there was many
[15:21] places you had greater spiritual
[15:24] background
[15:26] than what Bethlehem did
[15:29] for instance some of the places like
[15:32] Shiloh
[15:35] Shiloh was an ancient worship place
[15:38] of Israel where they all came year by
[15:42] year to the this great place where the
[15:46] Ark of the Lord rested
[15:50] and wonder why vanity wouldn't be born
[15:53] at Shiloh
[15:55] then there was the gilgale another great
[16:01] spiritual place of worship
[16:05] why wouldn't God let him be born then at
[16:08] gilgale
[16:11] and there was another Zion
[16:16] Zion was on the Mountaintop
[16:20] and we wonder why that Jesus would not
[16:24] be born then in Zion because if it's
[16:28] been a great
[16:30] historical markup where the Lord has
[16:35] blessed his people in the ages
[16:39] and it looks like that maybe he would
[16:41] have chosen Zion or gilgalar or
[16:47] Shiloh are one of the other great places
[16:51] where there have been great blessings
[16:54] and great teachings
[16:58] and there was other great cities such as
[17:01] Hebron
[17:02] that was a place for
[17:05] a man who was wanting a City of Refuge a
[17:09] place of safety
[17:11] there was remoth Gilead also another
[17:15] place of Refuge where the people could
[17:18] come which have been very appropriate
[17:20] for him to be born
[17:22] and maybe if I would have been thinking
[17:25] that I would have brought him over to
[17:27] Katie sparnia
[17:29] for there was a judgment seat
[17:32] and a place of Refuge
[17:35] perhaps I would have brought him over to
[17:38] that country for his birthplace or maybe
[17:40] we would have chosen some of the other
[17:43] cities
[17:45] but you know
[17:46] I'm so glad that even just little
[17:50] insignificant things in the Bible means
[17:53] so much
[17:56] I believe that it was Jesus it said this
[18:00] that you pass over and do the weightier
[18:05] matters of the law rather but pass over
[18:09] the little things
[18:11] and sometimes it's the little things
[18:14] that holds the big things together
[18:19] but all in all the great cogs is turning
[18:24] just exactly the way God ordained in the
[18:27] call there will never be one miss its
[18:30] place
[18:31] God is for ordained all things and it
[18:35] must hit just exactly to that place
[18:42] and when we get Faith like that and
[18:45] begin to think of who's behind all this
[18:49] what is the mainspring that's turning
[18:53] this great uh economy of God
[18:57] we find it's the Holy Spirit
[19:00] not left into the hands of man to do
[19:03] things but in the hands of the Holy
[19:07] Spirit
[19:09] and he is the mainspring that if he can
[19:12] get the rest of the instruments it'll
[19:15] work just perfectly keep exactly God's
[19:18] time
[19:22] and then we see that and we wander in
[19:25] our mind then as we look at great things
[19:28] and how that we would have him and then
[19:30] it gives us a lot of consolation today
[19:33] to think that
[19:34] maybe if we are a little group of people
[19:39] maybe if we are insignificant to the
[19:42] world and to the bigger churches of
[19:46] denominations
[19:48] yet God uses those little simple things
[19:51] sometime
[19:53] for it is also written in the scriptures
[19:56] fear not little flock it's your father's
[19:59] Good Will to give you the kingdom
[20:02] what a consolation that I know that just
[20:05] is sure as
[20:08] Jesus had to be born in little Bethlehem
[20:13] so will the little flock be the one that
[20:17] the father will give the kingdom to
[20:20] you because it's written and it all
[20:23] scripture is given by inspiration and
[20:27] the scriptures cannot be broken
[20:31] they must be fulfilled
[20:35] so it gives us that hope to know that
[20:40] that it'll be a little flock that will
[20:42] receive the kingdom a little faithful
[20:45] flock of believers
[20:48] I'm trusting to be one of those flowers
[20:51] or in that little flock I should say
[20:56] and then we know the story most all of
[20:59] us are acquainted with the story of how
[21:02] Israel came into Palestine by promise of
[21:05] God
[21:09] and we know that the great Joshua
[21:12] was the one who divided each tribe their
[21:16] potion
[21:20] and it's certainly if we had the time of
[21:24] about from now until six o'clock tonight
[21:27] just stay right on this subject to line
[21:31] these things away to get the real
[21:33] meaning out of them
[21:35] which we do not have just about 30 or 40
[21:38] minutes so we have to strike just the
[21:42] high points
[21:43] trusting that the Holy Spirit to you
[21:46] Bible readers will place the rest of it
[21:48] into your heart as we go along
[21:54] did you know that those potions how
[21:57] Joshua lauded them in Palestine was
[22:02] given by inspiration
[22:05] and those Hebrew mothers of those
[22:09] Patriarchs when the baby was coming
[22:11] forth in her intervaling pain to deliver
[22:14] the child she uttered the very spot
[22:20] that those Patriarchs would settle down
[22:22] and be at the last days
[22:26] talk about inspiration this Bible is
[22:29] inspired
[22:31] no matter how little just every little
[22:35] scripture
[22:36] has such an outstanding thing in the
[22:40] script
[22:41] and the great picture
[22:43] all of it every
[22:46] every word
[22:48] is inspired and all that hangs the
[22:52] destination of Souls
[22:55] for it's a word of the immortal and
[23:00] Eternal God
[23:03] and even those mothers
[23:05] when the baby was born and she uttered
[23:09] The Voice
[23:10] place them positionally where they'd be
[23:13] in the promised land hundreds of years
[23:15] later
[23:16] and Joshua not knowing that yet by the
[23:19] same inspiration place them exactly
[23:22] where they were to be
[23:26] and Joshua dividing up divided judah's
[23:31] potion
[23:33] if you'll notice on the map it's a
[23:35] geographically just west of the plain
[23:38] scene
[23:40] a few miles south of Jerusalem the
[23:44] capital
[23:45] and when Judah was giving her part or
[23:49] his part rather in the land his Province
[23:53] we would call it
[23:56] it's strange but this little city was
[24:00] not even mentioned Bethlehem
[24:04] yet it was there because that Abraham uh
[24:09] I believe it was Rebecca was buried at
[24:11] that place
[24:13] but it must have been just a little
[24:16] village of some sort because if you read
[24:19] Joshua 5 you'll find that there was a
[24:22] hundred and fifteen major cities under
[24:24] the domain of Judah besides the villages
[24:28] and little towns
[24:31] 115 cities mentioned
[24:36] and perhaps when it was divided up that
[24:39] Bethlehem was so little
[24:43] maybe just a a little house or two
[24:47] it wasn't even mentioned in the
[24:50] inheritance
[24:53] and then we find out that it never
[24:55] actually come to be known the one that
[24:59] founded it was Caleb's son Caleb's son
[25:04] whose name Islam
[25:07] and he founded it the Bible said he was
[25:10] the father of it which mean he was the
[25:13] founder of Bethlehem
[25:17] in other words he must have moved in
[25:19] there and started uh some sort of
[25:23] businesses and a commercial and the
[25:26] trading and so forth that grew it up
[25:30] and later we'll find out that the real
[25:32] reason of it that the whole land was
[25:35] jealous of that little piece of land
[25:36] which lays to the north and east and
[25:39] slopes a little to the south on that
[25:42] spur and it was the most fertile
[25:47] of all of Palestine
[25:51] it was a a corn belt and a wheat belt
[25:55] and there were great Olive Orchards and
[25:58] so forth on
[26:00] and that part of Bethlehem or Palestine
[26:04] the end of Judah
[26:06] province
[26:09] and we find out that it was also became
[26:14] the home of the
[26:17] Harlot rehab
[26:20] when Israel had passed over the
[26:24] borderline of the Jordan River into
[26:27] Palestine we are acquainted with the
[26:30] story of Rahab the heart
[26:34] let's picture her this morning for a few
[26:37] minutes now as a a young lady a
[26:40] beautiful young woman
[26:42] sudden Misfortune in life had been
[26:45] forced in being a pagan had been forced
[26:49] into the life that she was living
[26:53] and many times people are forced into
[26:56] the life that they live
[27:00] I was in the prisons the other night
[27:03] to see a man
[27:06] who was taken a sentence and I I took
[27:09] him by the hand and talked to him
[27:13] and I said why would you do such a thing
[27:16] as that
[27:18] and holding me by the hand he began to
[27:21] speak
[27:23] and he was forced into what he was doing
[27:27] I said because that you permitted that
[27:30] to force you to that you don't have to
[27:32] do that you know man has to drink
[27:35] I said I'm nervous myself
[27:39] but there's no need of that
[27:42] and this young woman after she'd got her
[27:45] first hearing of Israel
[27:49] another God who was a a God that
[27:52] answered prayer not only a God to pray
[27:55] to but a God that answered back
[27:58] when she heard that there was a god of
[28:01] Miracles
[28:10] her heart began to tremble
[28:14] and when she got the first message from
[28:18] two preachers that went over
[28:20] quickly she accepted it with all her
[28:23] heart
[28:25] and there was a Scarlet card bounded her
[28:28] window for protection of her house
[28:34] because that she had received the
[28:37] message
[28:39] now I might add year did you know she
[28:42] typed the Gentile Church
[28:46] she was a gentile
[28:49] and she was the type of the Gentile
[28:52] Church
[28:54] one day heard the message we were all
[28:57] out in spiritual prostitution
[29:02] committing spiritual fornications
[29:05] against the god of heaven and all kinds
[29:07] of stuff
[29:09] all kinds of denominations and religions
[29:14] that that was a God that still lived
[29:18] that could perform miracles
[29:21] quickly
[29:22] we received it the message
[29:27] there was applied the blood of the Lord
[29:30] Jesus
[29:31] which made the Scarlet card
[29:35] and to keep from going into detail you
[29:37] know how she hung it from her window
[29:39] publicly
[29:41] the blood was displayed publicly
[29:45] that's the way the blood's got to be
[29:48] displayed
[29:49] publicly
[29:52] hanging from the outside of the wall the
[29:55] show that on the inside something had
[29:58] taken place
[30:01] that's the way the True Believer in
[30:04] Christ is this morning
[30:06] on the outside is the display of the
[30:11] blood of the Lord Jesus that shows
[30:13] something took place on the inside
[30:18] and through this God looked down on the
[30:21] Wrath fell and the trumpets began to
[30:24] blow
[30:26] seen that Scarlet card hang in there as
[30:30] a memorial
[30:31] it's always pleased him to pass over the
[30:35] blood
[30:36] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[30:42] he saw it and went the shaking and the
[30:46] Holy Spirit
[30:48] Rumble the Earth and shut down that wall
[30:51] some 20 feet thick
[30:53] not one rock fell that cord was
[30:56] hanging
[30:58] shows the protection of a true God
[31:04] True Believer no matter what states
[31:06] you're in when he finds you if you'll
[31:09] just accept that Scarlet card
[31:13] it weeds to the Bible
[31:16] and then we see her
[31:19] when she was taking it as one of the
[31:22] Israelites
[31:24] she fell in love with the man which was
[31:27] a captain and a prince in Judah
[31:31] he was a captain of the Israelite armies
[31:36] his name was Solomon just like the King
[31:39] Solomon
[31:41] and he was the captain and she become in
[31:44] a great romance with this captain
[31:47] which was the prince of Judah
[31:52] and father she married him
[31:55] and when the estate was settled up for
[31:58] the Israelites she and her beloved
[32:01] husband lived in Bethlehem
[32:05] now you begin to see an open having him
[32:08] see it began to open as we see
[32:13] that in Bethlehem Sheila
[32:16] healing Aid Gentile bride to a Jew
[32:22] why because she believed in a
[32:26] miracle-working god
[32:29] and as look what she come from
[32:34] from the uh out of the house
[32:38] of ill-fame of prostitution
[32:42] through her conversion
[32:45] and you are unfailing faith in God it
[32:49] brought her from a prostitute house to a
[32:53] beautiful home in Bethlehem
[32:56] what a difference
[32:58] that's the way it does all of us
[33:02] from a house of unbelief and
[33:04] flusterations that a immoral action
[33:07] everything to a place position
[33:11] Christ which is most beautiful
[33:14] from the ridiculous to the sublime
[33:18] that's the difference
[33:20] that it makes
[33:22] through our conversion
[33:24] and did you see she married a prince
[33:28] all the house of Judah a captain that
[33:33] Captain represented Christ
[33:36] tucked to himself a gentile bride
[33:39] from the lowest of Lois to the principle
[33:43] and best place in the land
[33:46] as we'll get to it later in our message
[33:48] to prove that it was nothing else could
[33:51] be but that
[33:54] type of the Gentile Church
[33:59] and we find out they had a lovely home
[34:01] in Bethlehem
[34:03] as
[34:05] slam had had established it and that it
[34:09] would become a great place and the
[34:11] fertile lands and how beautiful it is to
[34:14] think of that great wheat country there
[34:19] I it would be the bread place of the
[34:22] world
[34:25] and it is true no wonder Jesus had to be
[34:28] born there
[34:30] because he was the bread of life
[34:35] that's where all the nation come for
[34:37] their wheat
[34:38] all the nations come farther Khan
[34:42] for it was in Bethlehem that had those
[34:46] fertile lands
[34:48] and you see the little bitty thing just
[34:50] saying oh it was the province of wheat
[34:53] yet that meant something
[34:56] and you see how this Gentile Prince or
[35:00] this Jewish Prince taking his Gentile
[35:03] bride back up to Bethlehem for a
[35:06] settling down place
[35:09] man
[35:11] a place to live
[35:13] where there was plenty of bread
[35:17] we find out through this great Romance
[35:20] ain't great obedience to Faith to the
[35:23] heart of Rahab
[35:24] she gave birth to a son
[35:29] to Solomon his name was Boaz
[35:34] and we all are acquainted with another
[35:37] great story tying in this link here now
[35:41] and Boaz was born in Bethlehem
[35:46] from Solomon and the Heart it read
[35:50] and we'll find out that years later
[35:54] after the neoma had left the country and
[35:57] gone over to sojourn with the mobenites
[36:02] and when they had to evily at in
[36:06] mistreated her and
[36:08] she got out of fellowship with the rest
[36:10] of the Believers and Associated yourself
[36:13] in a backslitting condition in another
[36:15] land among another people
[36:18] and otherwise she'd left the true
[36:21] believing Church to go out into the
[36:23] world for a little while
[36:25] to join some social Church who believed
[36:28] in just anything would be all right in
[36:31] there she lost her husband
[36:35] and it don't have to be every time in
[36:38] physical death you might lose him in a
[36:41] spiritual death
[36:43] or lose your wife
[36:45] better stay on Good Grounds
[36:49] you better stay where you know you're
[36:51] covered by the blood regardless of what
[36:54] the rest of them looks like
[36:56] how big they are how finest fires they
[36:59] have on their churches or how the big
[37:01] bells ring you better stay where the
[37:04] blood covers the sin
[37:06] of the people
[37:08] you might lose one another and above all
[37:11] you might lose the Lord Jesus
[37:15] to be barred out
[37:18] and we find out then that after her sons
[37:22] was gone she lost both of them
[37:26] and she returned back because there was
[37:29] no Revival spirit in the city at the
[37:32] time
[37:33] oh how I would love to rest here for a
[37:37] few minutes
[37:39] I would like to pick it up right here
[37:41] and show you regardless of how many of
[37:44] the churches gone back stay under the
[37:47] blood
[37:48] that's the place to buy
[37:51] in or out up or down thick or thin
[37:53] wherever it may be stay under the learn
[37:59] but Naoma she thought it would be better
[38:02] to go over and join another group
[38:03] because they were having troubles
[38:06] spiritual bread wasn't there
[38:09] and but God will restore it back I will
[38:12] restore saith the Lord
[38:16] stay in the field where it comes from
[38:19] so we find that she begin to long to go
[38:23] back because they heard that a great
[38:26] Revival had broke out and if you notice
[38:29] neoma returned in barley season the
[38:32] Bible said just at the time of the
[38:35] Harvest in other words when there was a
[38:37] great revival going on spiritually
[38:39] applying it
[38:41] she returned just in that season
[38:44] nothing left she had nothing
[38:48] in orify one of her sons wives when she
[38:52] come to look upon what she had to
[38:54] sacrifice being a type of the modern
[38:56] church if I have to go over there I'll
[38:59] have to get away from my dances I'll
[39:01] have to get away from my big time and my
[39:03] social Gatherings that she just wept and
[39:07] kissed her mother-in-law and returned
[39:09] back
[39:11] but here's a beautiful picture there was
[39:13] one named Ruth
[39:15] with her another daughter-in-law which
[39:18] is a type again of the Gentile bride
[39:21] who kissed her mother-in-law and said
[39:24] I'll forsake everything I'm going with
[39:27] you
[39:29] let your people be my people
[39:33] let your God be my God
[39:38] wherever you died there I'll die where
[39:41] you're buried there I'll be buried
[39:44] that's it
[39:46] that's what God wants it's not that
[39:49] borderline halfway but of absolute full
[39:54] surrender to the kingdom of God
[39:58] she kissed her
[40:00] and saw the they all said to discourage
[40:02] you said you better go back to your
[40:04] people I'm old and there's no more sons
[40:07] of me and the law was that she had to
[40:10] wait for a son I'm set then there's no
[40:14] more in me
[40:15] and if I would have a husband and I'd
[40:18] have a son you'd be too old to marry
[40:21] so you just returned back to your people
[40:24] but Ruth said I'll not go back
[40:28] Faith rooted grounded perfect Faith had
[40:33] come into Ruth's heart
[40:36] she said I'm going right with you and
[40:38] she cleaved to her
[40:41] held on to her I'm going to be where you
[40:44] are
[40:45] I like that
[40:47] and we're acquainted with the story as
[40:49] it goes on
[40:51] that this great Boaz which was the lord
[40:55] of the Harvest was in Harvest at the
[40:57] time and was a king Kinsmen
[41:01] to neoma
[41:03] and when she found Ruth out there in a
[41:06] little Mission gleaning
[41:08] every little straw that she could pick
[41:11] up that had some wheat on it she held to
[41:14] it
[41:15] for it was life
[41:18] boy as being the lord of the Harvest he
[41:22] commanded that his Reapers would drop a
[41:25] handful now and then for her and she
[41:27] would pick it up and with joy and she
[41:30] shot she shut down a great apron full of
[41:33] it that day
[41:34] and when Boaz the Lord the Harvest came
[41:37] out and looked upon Ruth and seen her
[41:40] faithfulness he fell in love with her
[41:44] what's Boaz
[41:46] represent Christ where was he at
[41:48] Bethlehem why was Ruth Come to Bethlehem
[41:54] where was she cleaning out in Bethlehem
[41:59] see all those spiritual significance to
[42:03] this hear me the background to this
[42:07] great scene that's taking place God
[42:09] knowing it in the beginning
[42:11] and she began to
[42:14] a question to her mother-in-law what she
[42:16] must do and finally Ruth was married to
[42:22] boys a gentile married to a prince again
[42:25] in Judah
[42:29] and settled down and lived in Bethlehem
[42:34] oh thou Lou Bethlehem
[42:37] aren't you the least among all the
[42:40] prince principal cities of of Palestine
[42:43] but it's pleased God who's knowing and
[42:47] going forth was from old from the
[42:49] beginning
[42:50] to have his son born there amen he knows
[42:55] all things it works it just to be right
[42:59] and there Ruth married Boaz
[43:03] and when Ruth and Boaz was married if we
[43:07] had time to go into the great story
[43:09] there which is one of the greatest love
[43:11] scenes of all ages
[43:14] when Ruth and Boaz were married
[43:19] and remember
[43:21] let's just stop for a minute here just
[43:23] too good to pass over
[43:27] Ruth was a gentile
[43:30] she had no inheritance with the Jew
[43:34] just like we Gentiles had no inheritance
[43:37] so neoma was actually the one to inherit
[43:42] so she'd lost all of her first estate
[43:45] all of her Goods have been sold at
[43:48] public auction
[43:50] therefore she was been excommunicated
[43:53] and had gone away
[43:55] now when she come back there was only
[43:58] one person who could ever redeem her
[44:01] lost in Heritage
[44:03] that was a Kinsmen right next to her
[44:08] and
[44:11] boy has new so he had
[44:14] worked
[44:15] she could get this Gentile girl for a
[44:18] wife
[44:20] and what did he had to do he had to buy
[44:22] all of the estate of neoma in order to
[44:28] get in this estate which Ruth was part
[44:31] of the estate omnioma
[44:34] and the only man it could buy would have
[44:37] to be a person that was kin folks
[44:40] dear Kinsmen that was the law of
[44:42] redemption
[44:44] and the only way that Christ
[44:47] could ever buy the estate of the
[44:51] backslidden Israel
[44:53] was to become a Kinsmen
[44:56] the only way God could redeem the human
[44:58] race God himself had to be made flesh
[45:03] and Jesus was God made kin folks to the
[45:08] human race
[45:10] he was Emmanuel he become kin folks he
[45:15] took upon him not the form of angels but
[45:17] the form of a servant who washed the
[45:20] feet and limbed the fox's had holes and
[45:23] the birds of the air had Nest but he
[45:26] didn't even have a place to lay his head
[45:29] he eat drink he he cried he left
[45:34] just like other man and he was God
[45:38] not a prophet he was God
[45:42] amen
[45:44] because he had to be kin folks in order
[45:47] to redeem the loss human race
[45:53] so Boaz in this great type at Bethlehem
[45:57] look where this Kinsman was born
[46:00] to the human race
[46:03] had to be
[46:05] and then when this a great Boaz
[46:09] redeemed he had to make a public showing
[46:13] that he had redeemed all of her lost
[46:15] estate so he went to the gate of
[46:18] Bethlehem
[46:20] that little city again and he called the
[46:23] Elders of the city
[46:25] and he let them know that that day he
[46:28] had bought everything that had neoma had
[46:32] lost
[46:33] everything that she lost he bought it
[46:36] back and he kicked off his chute and
[46:39] threw it up before the people as an
[46:40] enzyme
[46:42] and if there's anyone who has any any
[46:45] reason to say something say it now
[46:48] for this is memorial and I've redeemed
[46:50] everything that she had lost
[46:54] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[46:58] and when our Kinsmen came
[47:02] Jesus is Nazareth
[47:05] barred and Bethlehem
[47:08] he stood on top of the
[47:11] and lifted him up between the heavens
[47:14] and earth as a memorial that he had
[47:16] redeemed everything that the human race
[47:19] had lost in the fall amen how can men
[47:23] despise Divine Healing
[47:25] and the powers of the resurrection of
[47:28] the Lord Jesus
[47:30] when a public in sign was made of
[47:33] Calvary that I've redeemed the whole
[47:35] human race and everything that they ever
[47:37] lost
[47:39] redeemed our soul redeemed our body
[47:42] redeemed everything that we lost in the
[47:46] fall our kinsman redeemer came and was
[47:48] made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[47:50] offered up the inside
[47:52] and said it's finished what's finished
[47:55] everything is finished amen we're just
[47:58] walking right into our inheritance
[48:02] as the days go on we're walking closer
[48:05] and closer
[48:07] Boaz and Naoma after being married for
[48:12] some time
[48:13] they bought forth a son
[48:15] which added more to the lineage and that
[48:19] was orbited
[48:20] and he also brought forth his son which
[48:24] was Jesse
[48:27] and Jesse had eight boys
[48:31] and it was a great prophet Samuel
[48:34] who came with the crew saw the arrow
[48:38] the great prophet who went to Jesse and
[48:41] said God has chosen one of your boys
[48:49] Rule and serve my people
[48:53] and it was out in the dark side of the
[48:55] field a little Shepherd Shepherd yard
[48:58] we're a little Ruddy scrawny looking boy
[49:01] was brought David
[49:03] the older the youngest
[49:06] and Samuel poured the anointing oil on
[49:09] him in the presence
[49:11] of all these brothers
[49:13] and prove that God anointed in King
[49:18] where was that at Bethlehem
[49:22] glory to God in the highest oh Wonder
[49:27] Bethlehem
[49:29] where he was anointed king
[49:32] and it was in Bethlehem where David was
[49:35] born
[49:38] hey
[49:40] his greater son Jesus was also had to be
[49:44] born in Bethlehem because they're such a
[49:47] close knit between the two his father
[49:49] and son
[49:52] Not only was this great son only the son
[49:54] he was the root and The Offspring of
[49:57] David
[49:58] he was even before David and be after
[50:01] David he was born for Everlasting from
[50:04] Everlasting on
[50:06] but according to the Flesh and all the
[50:09] things to be fulfilled he was the son of
[50:13] David
[50:15] he was to be born years later in this
[50:18] same Bethlehem this little forsaken City
[50:22] but all the time in there do you notice
[50:25] there's working a great Mighty mystery
[50:28] that no one seemed to understand
[50:32] that's the same thing it is in God's
[50:34] Bethlehem today there's working as a
[50:37] mystery sign
[50:40] that no one seems to understand it
[50:44] it's something that goes over the top of
[50:46] the heads of the people
[50:48] they don't seem to get it
[50:50] no matter what's done or what's said in
[50:52] the mysterious part of the things that's
[50:54] done the people that say oh well I guess
[50:56] it's all right and wow but they don't
[50:59] understand
[51:01] they can't catch it they can't grasped
[51:06] that's what God was doing in Bethlehem
[51:09] in Judea
[51:11] is working all these little things
[51:13] moving up to come to one great hand
[51:17] David
[51:19] oh when he was anointed king as a a
[51:23] little boy he was ready to look up at
[51:26] but he must have been something in that
[51:28] that looked real to God
[51:31] they're a little bitty the smallest of
[51:33] the family
[51:35] the rest of the boys great big fine man
[51:37] would look good in the robes and a crown
[51:39] on their head
[51:41] God showed what he looks at
[51:44] not the outward appearance but the
[51:47] inside of a man
[51:50] he looked at his heart
[51:52] he knew what was in David's heart
[51:55] no matter how the crown looked on him
[51:58] he knowed he was
[51:59] hiding him a man
[52:02] a man man after his own heart
[52:05] which David would be a man after his own
[52:09] heart
[52:10] that's why he poured the anointing oil
[52:12] or had it poured up on David
[52:16] which the name David means beloved
[52:19] and it was well represented in Jesus the
[52:22] beloved one
[52:25] years later the son of David
[52:28] come to fulfill all things
[52:30] that have been promised
[52:33] this little city of Bethlehem is where
[52:35] this taken place
[52:36] it was on them same little Judean Hills
[52:40] were
[52:41] David heard of his sheep
[52:45] many years later that the Angels sang
[52:49] their First Noel
[52:52] on the hills of Judea overlooking
[52:55] Bethlehem
[52:57] The First Noel
[53:01] unto thee is born in the city of David
[53:05] Christ the lord
[53:09] when Angels first made their appearance
[53:12] the same it wasn't that Jerusalem the
[53:14] big church
[53:16] neither was that gilgale on neither was
[53:19] it a shadow or that had the religious
[53:22] denomination of worship all the time but
[53:24] it was a little Bethlehem
[53:27] or the spirit of God had been moving in
[53:31] a mysterious way bringing forth
[53:32] something
[53:35] there
[53:36] there where Christ had to come he was
[53:39] there inside in that same Little City
[53:45] with a King born that a mother virgin
[53:50] son
[53:54] it's sheltered and housed in its little
[53:57] Fortress
[53:59] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[54:04] we're not only did Samuel come to pour
[54:07] out the anointing oil with God toward
[54:10] them upon him and upon the world
[54:14] Christ the lord
[54:17] the Angels Herald is coming and saying
[54:20] to the Shepherds on the hillside who
[54:22] followed David the king
[54:25] years before
[54:27] see the mystery of God how great it is
[54:29] he was born in this great wheat belt
[54:32] which one week comes forth the basic
[54:34] principles of life
[54:37] and he was the bread of life I am the
[54:41] bread of life he that eats my flesh and
[54:44] drinks my blood has eternal life and
[54:46] shall never die hard coming to college
[54:49] but pass from death
[54:54] Bethlehem
[54:56] the name Bethel b-e-t-h-beth Beth in the
[55:00] Hebrew word means house
[55:03] e-l stands for Elohim it's abbreviation
[55:06] Elohim means god
[55:10] b-e-t-h-beth e-l e-l is Elohim which is
[55:15] God the house of God
[55:18] or the bread of life is laid
[55:25] e-l-h-e-m finish it out Bring Back Your
[55:28] hell again with your e means a loaf of
[55:32] bread in the Hebrew
[55:37] El is God Elohim
[55:40] b-e-t-h is bth is b-e-t-h's house
[55:45] e-l is Elohim abbreviation
[55:48] then
[55:50] e-l-e-m is
[55:52] bread
[55:53] what was he the house of the bread of
[55:58] God
[56:00] the house of God's bread
[56:05] house Beth Elohim God l e m bread the
[56:11] house of God's bread means the Bethlehem
[56:14] where could he be born anywhere else but
[56:17] that
[56:19] but what's here to everybody for that
[56:21] prophet
[56:22] he said out of Bethlehem shall come him
[56:25] there's looking in Jerusalem there's
[56:27] looking at all the big Shiloh he said
[56:28] looking everywhere everybody come from
[56:32] oh it was a house of God's bread of life
[56:38] it's God's Bread Basket to the world
[56:42] there he was born in Bethlehem
[56:45] he could be born nowhere else
[56:48] there could be many great things that I
[56:51] was studying this week of the different
[56:52] spiritual aspects to that why he must be
[56:55] born in Bethlehem when I hit these new
[56:57] places the Holy Spirit just caught me
[57:00] away and I said oh God that's sufficient
[57:03] amen I see it now he could not be born
[57:06] nowhere else but Bethlehem
[57:09] there's a place of the bread of the
[57:12] nation it was the bread of all the house
[57:14] of Israel come from there and he was the
[57:17] bread of life that come down from heaven
[57:18] the spiritual manner
[57:23] has to come from Bethlehem
[57:26] the breadline the place where bread Lays
[57:32] Bethlehem
[57:33] the baking of the bread
[57:37] now
[57:38] Jesus being the bread of life
[57:40] a man may eat thereof he said and never
[57:43] die
[57:44] another great event that I wouldn't
[57:46] forget to call
[57:48] that was when David was in his
[57:51] worst of time
[57:53] when he was a fugitive
[57:57] it already been anointed he knowed what
[58:00] he was to be he was to be king God said
[58:03] so
[58:04] yet he was hated he was standing in
[58:07] between two great deep fires here was
[58:10] the Philistines on one side actually
[58:12] there was salt on the other side and he
[58:14] was a man without a nation
[58:18] just as the church stands the day the
[58:20] true Living Church of God without a
[58:22] denomination or anything else
[58:24] alone but yet
[58:30] she knows what she is
[58:33] how in the well can it ever come to pass
[58:37] the devil on both sides drowning at
[58:40] David
[58:42] taking refuge and strongholds to the
[58:44] Wilderness and in caves
[58:46] trying to hide out
[58:50] with a little band of faithful Warriors
[58:52] just a few believing like him
[58:56] but those men believe God that that
[58:58] would be the king
[59:00] so is the Believers today whose head out
[59:03] from place to place
[59:05] but yet they know who's coming to be
[59:08] king I don't care who's going to be
[59:09] president we know he's coming
[59:13] it looks farther away than it ever did
[59:15] when science is trying to overru and say
[59:17] they can build a man they can do this
[59:18] and they take a rabbit and take the
[59:20] pollen and make another rabbit and so
[59:22] forth trying to disprove God's work yet
[59:24] there is a people who believe God who
[59:27] stands just as Pat as they ever did
[59:30] no matter what comes or go they still
[59:32] believe God God's right
[59:35] the whole to God's unchanging hands in
[59:38] the midst of battle in the midst of
[59:40] Tears in the midst of sickness and death
[59:42] and
[59:42] everything they still hold of God's
[59:47] unchain they know that he's coming King
[59:50] people that ain't life and make fun of
[59:52] them they call them Holy Rollers call
[59:53] them everything they want to but they
[59:55] have wires of God stands faithful at the
[59:58] post of Duty
[59:59] might call them a healing group you
[1:00:01] might call him a bunch of Fanatics or
[1:00:03] whatever you wish to they hang to that
[1:00:05] King
[1:00:07] they know he's coming in power
[1:00:09] though they take his name in Dane and
[1:00:11] scoff and make fun and call the people
[1:00:13] who pleaded Outcast a bunch of backwash
[1:00:18] that doesn't bother them a bit they stay
[1:00:21] true at the post of Duty
[1:00:23] those wires that was with David stayed
[1:00:26] right by his son
[1:00:28] if a Philistine come up
[1:00:30] he had to fight whoever it was they were
[1:00:32] picked on every side
[1:00:35] toward David in his mind all confused he
[1:00:39] thought how can it be Lord
[1:00:42] you know leaders sometimes go through
[1:00:43] things that the congregation don't know
[1:00:45] what they're going through
[1:00:47] when you think of promises God's made
[1:00:49] then why don't he come to pass
[1:00:51] they don't tell their congregation they
[1:00:53] don't tell the people they associate
[1:00:54] with but there's many frustrations in
[1:00:57] the heart of a real leader
[1:00:59] David's sitting there his throat burning
[1:01:02] him is in the middle of summer
[1:01:04] the Philistines is taking advantage of
[1:01:06] that split between David and Saul and
[1:01:10] Saul looking for David or the
[1:01:11] Philistines also
[1:01:13] and then the police needs looking for
[1:01:15] the Israelites talk about a time of
[1:01:16] confusion just about like it is now
[1:01:20] David taking refuge in this little place
[1:01:23] and this little shelter everywhere he
[1:01:24] could get to the little strongholds that
[1:01:26] he could hold him to then he got up on
[1:01:28] the mountain on that Huts middle of the
[1:01:30] summer when the heat was tremendous his
[1:01:33] throat parching
[1:01:34] and flusterations and fears in his heart
[1:01:37] and wondering oh God how could it be you
[1:01:41] poured that oil upon me not because I
[1:01:44] chose myself but you chose me
[1:01:47] why did you call me from hurting the
[1:01:50] Sheep I did her and told me you'd give
[1:01:52] me this to serve your people
[1:01:58] that was going through his heart
[1:02:01] he sat upon the hill and he looked down
[1:02:02] and there the Philistines that come in
[1:02:05] and Garrison right in Bethlehem is alone
[1:02:09] then his little city was under
[1:02:11] government control of the enemy
[1:02:14] not only that but his own Father's House
[1:02:16] Jesse's house was under bondage to the
[1:02:19] philistine
[1:02:21] there was his own Nation his own church
[1:02:23] against him
[1:02:25] there was the end he was fighting years
[1:02:27] to church people he was fighting
[1:02:29] not because he wanted you but because he
[1:02:32] was forced to do it
[1:02:34] many times we were forced to do things
[1:02:36] and say things that we don't want to say
[1:02:39] a real spiritual leader but he's forced
[1:02:42] to do it
[1:02:44] he has to take his side and show his
[1:02:46] colors
[1:02:48] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:02:51] despised you said the songwriter
[1:02:55] so there he was on a hot day no doubt
[1:02:58] walking back and forth and looking down
[1:03:00] through that Long Valley
[1:03:02] of about 25 miles down their back that
[1:03:05] was his own father's house and
[1:03:08] and bondage to the Philistines they were
[1:03:10] sold just across shutter that and here
[1:03:12] come this one sitting right between see
[1:03:14] to take sides seen the great time that
[1:03:17] Israel was all broke up the church broke
[1:03:20] up in different denominations as to say
[1:03:21] here was David standing back here not
[1:03:24] knowing what to do and yet knowing all
[1:03:26] him rested the anointing
[1:03:30] they knew that in the honey was there
[1:03:34] they knew David is going to be king
[1:03:37] Hallelujah amen we know who's going to
[1:03:41] be king
[1:03:41] it doesn't matter who's going to be
[1:03:43] president I know who's going to be king
[1:03:48] you'll be king
[1:03:51] I know it take something to stand
[1:03:54] but God helped me to shut my eyes to
[1:03:57] denominations and everything else
[1:03:59] and look to that spiritual sight down
[1:04:01] here and he's the coming King
[1:04:04] I'll serve him
[1:04:06] if it's death let me die
[1:04:09] if it's my family it's my loved ones if
[1:04:12] it's not in nominations everything let
[1:04:14] me serve him
[1:04:16] I'll stay to him
[1:04:19] that's the Warriors of God like it's
[1:04:21] with David
[1:04:22] that had their hands on their sword
[1:04:24] walking anytime
[1:04:26] that's the way God's lawyers walk rain
[1:04:30] yeah man the enemy says you have to take
[1:04:32] a little drink to be sociable odd time's
[1:04:34] not your unclean vans amen there's the
[1:04:38] enemy
[1:04:39] there's the choir
[1:04:41] oh Lord you renounce that Oh Holy Roller
[1:04:44] stuff you believe I believe God on stand
[1:04:46] true there you are there's the Warriors
[1:04:50] Oh you mean there's no such a thing as
[1:04:52] Divine Healing that's what you think I
[1:04:53] know better
[1:04:56] there's no such a thing as the baptism
[1:04:58] the Holy Ghost them days is passed on
[1:05:00] that's what you think I've already
[1:05:02] received that you're just too late to
[1:05:03] tell me anything about it
[1:05:05] they knew the anointing was on that
[1:05:08] little Ruddy looking fella
[1:05:10] he's going to be king
[1:05:12] but David in his own mind was flustrated
[1:05:16] I can imagine this watching a minute
[1:05:18] goes back out there and sits down and
[1:05:20] looks down there and thinks my own
[1:05:22] beloved City Bethlehem look at it there
[1:05:26] were the great things of God has taken
[1:05:29] place or my father's father's father's
[1:05:32] father was born were my greats greats
[1:05:34] great greats grandmother honored in her
[1:05:37] in the time of the birth of Judah from
[1:05:41] whose child I'm from the younger laid
[1:05:44] something Supernatural she uttered the
[1:05:46] place in there Joshua placed the sun
[1:05:48] right in there and through theirs come
[1:05:50] all these things sure it's got to be
[1:05:53] I was a sheep hurt and you poured oil on
[1:05:55] my head
[1:05:56] you said I'd be king I believe you
[1:05:58] amen then he goes back and looks down
[1:06:01] there and thinks well Way Down Under My
[1:06:03] Little City
[1:06:04] where I was born that little group where
[1:06:06] I was with
[1:06:07] them good old days
[1:06:09] it'd be better if the methodists look
[1:06:12] back to their good old days when they're
[1:06:14] a few and far between little school
[1:06:15] houses out here in America falling under
[1:06:18] the power of God and throwing water in
[1:06:20] their face
[1:06:21] it'd be better for you Baptist to look
[1:06:23] back to where you come from too
[1:06:25] and the rest of you Pentecost look back
[1:06:27] where you come from
[1:06:29] it's Ryan In the Heat of the battle here
[1:06:31] David began to think
[1:06:34] oh I can ring
[1:06:36] that's all they got younger on that
[1:06:38] Hillside
[1:06:39] I remember when I watched them Stars how
[1:06:42] they moved up down here how God talked
[1:06:44] to my little boy heart
[1:06:47] I can remember when I got so in the
[1:06:49] spirit one day looking at the clouds and
[1:06:52] the Shady Green Pastures the eye
[1:06:54] screamed down the spirit insane the Lord
[1:06:58] is my shepherd Shepherd
[1:07:03] walk to the Valley of the Shadows of
[1:07:05] death all fear no evil for Thy Art with
[1:07:07] me
[1:07:08] here he was right in the jaws of death
[1:07:11] right then on both sides yeah I'll walk
[1:07:15] to the Valley of the shadow of death
[1:07:17] them good old days
[1:07:20] old days when God was with me
[1:07:23] a saying his Praises I am joining I
[1:07:27] remember one time the little lion come
[1:07:28] up one morning he got one of my sheep
[1:07:31] and the spirit of God Came Upon me and I
[1:07:33] went out and grabbed him and cut him to
[1:07:34] pieces I remember that Deliverance
[1:07:38] oh I can remember that evening just
[1:07:40] before the sun went down a bear coming
[1:07:43] and got one in our killing
[1:07:46] them great Deliverance
[1:07:48] I remember when I sing his praises and
[1:07:51] my childhood days when I heard in my
[1:07:53] sheep oh God take me back to that place
[1:07:57] take me back to my first love
[1:08:01] take me back and give me back my
[1:08:03] Shepherds to heaven give me back my herd
[1:08:06] of sheep
[1:08:07] let me alone back there to worship you
[1:08:09] that's sometimes we think that but we're
[1:08:11] in the heat of the battle
[1:08:13] something's got to be done
[1:08:16] we were boys once we were growing up man
[1:08:18] now the fight's on
[1:08:20] I remember when the sawdust barred up on
[1:08:23] the floor and the people screamed and
[1:08:24] shouted and you couldn't get around the
[1:08:26] place nowhere here for people but it's
[1:08:28] not that way today the title Zone
[1:08:32] oh it's not William brand the little boy
[1:08:34] preacher anymore you got to produce
[1:08:36] something
[1:08:38] yes sir there's got to be something
[1:08:39] different
[1:08:41] the time's on the battle's on the heat
[1:08:45] is on
[1:08:46] the talent to be delivered to people
[1:08:48] everyone's found written in the book now
[1:08:51] the time has come David and all these
[1:08:54] frustrations walking back and forth and
[1:08:56] thinking to hold this hot day
[1:08:58] oh it's so hot oh subtle might come from
[1:09:01] this way the Philistines in this way
[1:09:03] armies around everywhere and here we are
[1:09:06] sitting in the mouth of the cave
[1:09:08] and yet the anointing all on me how can
[1:09:10] it be oh God how can it be well I wish I
[1:09:14] had a drink then his mind goes back to
[1:09:17] way down there but the gates of
[1:09:19] Bethlehem
[1:09:21] there was a whale
[1:09:23] there just was no water like that water
[1:09:27] Palestine has some bad water
[1:09:29] they have
[1:09:33] uh and they have even to Blackwater
[1:09:35] fevered stuff in them
[1:09:37] and a lot of it is alkaline water which
[1:09:39] would kill you
[1:09:40] but Bethlehem is a water seat
[1:09:44] of the province too
[1:09:46] there was no water like Bethlehem
[1:09:49] David used to think when I take my sheep
[1:09:52] and start out of a morning I'd go buy
[1:09:54] that old well and drink
[1:09:56] oh how cool and how sweet and height
[1:09:59] quench The Thirst then nice Strokes are
[1:10:03] going yet anointed
[1:10:05] holy
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:07] butter
[1:10:08] nice Warriors
[1:10:10] and he screamed out in his despair oh
[1:10:13] it's someone but bring me a drink again
[1:10:17] amen from that Old Well honored
[1:10:20] Bethlehem
[1:10:22] oh after dreaming of all of his
[1:10:24] childhood days and the victories and see
[1:10:27] him in a place where he's standing here
[1:10:28] between the fires he screamed oh someone
[1:10:31] could bring me water from Bethlehem
[1:10:34] now his Warriors cannot interpret his
[1:10:37] thinking
[1:10:37] but brother they loved him with all that
[1:10:40] was there
[1:10:42] the least of his desires was a commander
[1:10:45] three of his Mighty Warriors polar
[1:10:47] swords slipped off from the camp and cut
[1:10:50] their way 25 miles
[1:10:54] David they're going no doubt wondering
[1:10:58] where are they at what have they done
[1:11:00] where did they go to did they know
[1:11:03] they're jeopardizing their life
[1:11:05] they're right in the jaws of death
[1:11:07] through a 25 mile island Ambush
[1:11:11] everywhere and the swords have flickered
[1:11:13] in the shields of blasting
[1:11:15] but there are man their brother that
[1:11:18] they believed that would be king this is
[1:11:21] our degree
[1:11:22] oh brother I wonder if the wires today
[1:11:25] are willing to cut their way through
[1:11:27] formalism now of unbelief
[1:11:30] to refreshed in the presence of the Lord
[1:11:32] his desires
[1:11:35] the least of yours is ours if it's
[1:11:37] Africa India if it's to the street
[1:11:39] wherever it is the least of your desires
[1:11:42] Lord is my command
[1:11:44] death don't mean a thing to me
[1:11:47] popularity must what I am what I will be
[1:11:50] means nothing the Lord is to fulfill
[1:11:53] your desires
[1:11:54] that's the Warriors that's standing by
[1:11:56] the side of you if they call me holy
[1:11:58] Rover if my name is scandalized that
[1:12:00] they kick me in the streets that doesn't
[1:12:02] matter
[1:12:04] yours are is my command
[1:12:08] that's the real Soldier
[1:12:11] what did they do they thought their way
[1:12:13] through until they got to that well they
[1:12:16] dipped the bucket of water out and here
[1:12:18] they come back fighting
[1:12:20] cutting her away from right to left unto
[1:12:22] come into the presence of David
[1:12:25] said here you are my Lord oh my God
[1:12:28] what a man that was disgraced the man
[1:12:31] that was hated by the church a man that
[1:12:33] was hated by the king a man that was
[1:12:36] hated by the for his teens a man that
[1:12:38] was faded everywhere nearly but a little
[1:12:41] group that followed him they knew that
[1:12:43] he was a coming King
[1:12:45] today I know you he's saying great songs
[1:12:48] we build great churches we have great
[1:12:50] anthems and everything we praise to him
[1:12:52] like that but Jesus said it your hearts
[1:12:55] you're far from me for you teach for
[1:12:57] Doctrine the Commandments of man let the
[1:12:59] Holy Spirit come in and do something in
[1:13:01] the church showing the presence of Jesus
[1:13:03] Christ he'll kick you out the door
[1:13:06] in vain do you worship me
[1:13:09] they worship but in vain do you do it
[1:13:12] teaching for Doctrine the traditions of
[1:13:15] man
[1:13:16] but there's Warriors who believe him
[1:13:18] because why is you stand by with a
[1:13:21] spiritual understanding like a little
[1:13:22] Bethlehem
[1:13:24] sure well David picks up this bucket of
[1:13:27] water
[1:13:28] he looked at it and the Bible said it he
[1:13:30] poured it up on the ground
[1:13:32] said Lord be it far from me that I'd
[1:13:36] drink that because these my thy lawyers
[1:13:38] had jeopardized their life to go get her
[1:13:42] and to bring this water to me hits the
[1:13:44] blood of man
[1:13:46] I cannot do it in this Sweet Water that
[1:13:49] they jeopardize their lives and broke to
[1:13:51] the Enemy Lines to go we are to get
[1:13:53] David Pour It Up On The Ground as a free
[1:13:56] will offering to the Lord
[1:13:58] it wasn't me it was only fulfilling the
[1:14:01] scriptures because although Jesus from
[1:14:04] Bethlehem is the bread of life he also
[1:14:07] is the Water of Life
[1:14:09] sure it is what did he do he was
[1:14:12] represented both David and warriors
[1:14:14] because he was the king and he was a
[1:14:18] wire who came and broke to the enemy's
[1:14:20] lines
[1:14:22] amen conquered that hell in the grave
[1:14:26] poured out his own blood
[1:14:30] that John 3 16 might be fulfilled
[1:14:33] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:14:37] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:14:39] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:14:41] would have eternal life that he give not
[1:14:44] the water that represented but I he was
[1:14:47] the water of Parish of perishing people
[1:14:50] that might have life how did he do it
[1:14:52] through his own blood by pouring it out
[1:14:55] not spilling it that's an accident he
[1:14:57] poured it out freely at Calvary after he
[1:15:00] broke through every line of the enemy
[1:15:02] and poured out his life blood that he
[1:15:05] might be the Bread Basket to the world
[1:15:09] and the fountain filled with blood drawn
[1:15:12] from Emmanuel's veins when Sears plans
[1:15:15] beneath the flood lose all their guilty
[1:15:18] stains
[1:15:19] that's why he was born in Bethlehem
[1:15:21] that's why he had to come because it was
[1:15:24] a bread sinner the bread of life it was
[1:15:26] a water sitter what is it the Waters of
[1:15:29] life and in Jesus was both bread of life
[1:15:33] and Waters of life therefore he had to
[1:15:36] come and be born in Bethlehem thou
[1:15:40] Bethlehem of Judea are you not the least
[1:15:43] among all the great princes you're just
[1:15:46] an ordinary little preacher you're just
[1:15:49] a little fellow but out of you shall
[1:15:53] which is from old Everlasting to
[1:15:56] Everlasting
[1:15:58] his four goings has been going forth
[1:16:00] from ever
[1:16:02] and from Everlasting to Everlasting
[1:16:04] that's why he was born in Bethlehem of
[1:16:07] Judea it cradled him and my brother the
[1:16:11] place he wants to be cradled today is in
[1:16:13] your own being your own heart that he
[1:16:16] might display from you the Waters of
[1:16:18] life to a perishing people and the bread
[1:16:20] of life to our starving people he is the
[1:16:23] bread and water of life which is the two
[1:16:25] essential things to a man's living is

[1:23:56] like that and he made about a bite or
[1:23:57] two and he just couldn't go no farther
