Description:
Faith In Your Death
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
September 7th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believer
 in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

We want to remember him this morning. Amen. and all of those that are out sick and different needs in the body. If you have a need, just lift your hand out to him this morning. Amen. He knows your heart. Amen. The most important thing is that so that he knows and we come together as one people. We could pray in faith that the Lord will certainly hear your need this morning. Brother Tim Saler has a message for us if you could come at this time. Um and then after that, we'll the brothers that are collecting the offerings will come and we'll do that. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Morning. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. Welcome to the house of God this morning. Uh just a little bit of housekeeping regarding Sunday school activities. Today is the first day of Sunday school. As you probably realize, you got your children in. Um we'd like you to have them in anywhere from 9:30 up until 10:00. Uh after 10:00, we're going to close the doors and class will begin and bring your children on in if you're if you're past that time. Um a couple things we need to take care of is that all the classrooms uh other than class times are off limits. So, if you need to take your child out and there's not enough space and overflow and you go into the to the fellowship hall for feeding your children or letting them get their energy out or whatever, they don't go in the classrooms. They're not lockable, but we don't want you in the classrooms, especially the open classroom that we have to use in the edge of the fellowship hall. There are probably tables out, work being going on. That's not for use of entertainment for the children. We don't need scribbling, writing, all the decorations. Teachers work hard and putting those things up. So, we need that's off limits as well. Okay. Uh there's a supply room and that's for Sunday school only. So, we don't go in there to get crayons and paper so they can write on that kind of thing. Um so, please respect that and it will be monitored. Uh, also as you go in the fellowship hall to the left, there are a couple tables there of lost and found items and it's starting to grow and we need to get those out of there. So, if there's any items you think you may have lost, Bibles, clothing items, barrettes, everything you put in your hair, everything, it's all accumulated over there. So, that's going to be going away if no one claims it. It'll be donated or or taken out. So, if if you've lost anything, you're welcome to go search through and find your items. Um, I just I want you to know that, you know, we we highly regard your children and responsibility that we have. Um, Jesus himself told Pilate, he said, "Everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice." And I think as our brother prayed this morning, when the minister comes, we want to see the person of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; manifested in his word. And if we realize each one of us have the same vindication, same manifestation that we have to live out in our lives. Okay? Our Sunday school teachers work hard on prepping the the information and we feel like we want to give them the very truth and they grow into the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus. It's a present day Lord Jesus that we're trying to express. &gt;&gt; So Lord bless you in these efforts. If you have any questions and if you haven't registered your children, please register them. Uh they're very welcome. Uh we'll get them on the list and uh and get them in Sunday school. Any questions just see me after or sister Melinda whatever you have need of we'll try to provide Lord bless you he's asked me to to pray over the request I do that as well so let's all just bow our heads our gracious and kind heavenly father truly Lord we want to manifest you in everything we say and do and Lord as a heavenly father &gt;&gt; you have oversight You have control. You have dominion. And Lord, we come as your children. Lord, submit ourselves. And ask Lord humbly that you would do for us, Lord, what we have need of. Lord, you wouldn't turn us away. And Lord, you know our needs, the earnings of our hearts, Lord, the the the cry, Lord, of even our spirits this morning. Lord, we pray that you'd fill in every gap, every missing piece. Lord, we might be complete and whole when we leave this place. Lord, we realize this by the preaching of the word, Lord, that we step up a little higher. We come to more grace, more knowledge, Lord, by the very truth, Lord. You express it to Pilate yourself, Lord. When you're here in the flesh, Lord, he said, "I find no fault in this man." And Lord, we can't find any fault because you were the perfect sacrifice. And Lord, if we'll accept that and apply it to our lives with the blood of Christ, we can also walk before you and be perfect. Grant it now, Lord, as we we just endeavor to serve you and lift you up, Lord. Bless the tithes and the offerings that are collected, Lord. Any needs or requests in the hearts of the people, Lord, may you just complete the work in them. We grant it now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

You so loved the world that you begot a son like you in every way, full of your love, full of your compassion, full of your power. And yet, Father, every bit our kinsmen and he sacrificed, Father, in ourstead to set us free. We ask you to bless us this morning as we fellowship around your word and and just share our heart with the people this morning, Father, that they have a full understanding of my heart and the direction that my heart is leading me, Father, that they can make a choice if this is the path they would choose to go. We ask you to bless them and help us this morning. And may your presence be here, Father, for those that need you, Father. We're all needy, but Father, there may be some that are in desperate situation. We ask that you would come by and show your mercy and goodness to them. We ask these things in Jesus precious and holy name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles this morning, we're going to turn to um uh we're going to read quite several different scriptures this morning, kind of maybe like in a little of a Bible school uh type lesson. Uh and so we're going to start with Romans 6 uh uh verse chapter 6, 6 and 7. But I just want to make a a little uh clarification. Um this morning uh uh during our youth meeting, they they made an announcement about an upcoming meeting in Carolina. And I just want you to know they they played that video without my knowledge. and the and uh cuz I I want you to know we're not against the meeting or against any ministry. But um we don't really promote any other preachers or ministries here but brother Brandham. I just want you to know that and we you know we don't want you to go to a meeting because of the food or the facility &gt;&gt; or the preachers. We want you to go because you've prayed about it. and you feel led by the Holy Spirit. And uh uh I I am going through a uh I guess my age, you know, I'm seeing such a trend and such a move to modernism. It is I down more. All right. Maybe hear hear me better now. Okay. All right. So we're going to uh uh such a trend of of entertainment and modernism, you know, so uh you everything's got to be some sort of uh picture or some sort of video. And in fact, they even have uh what do they call AI Brother Brandham movies? And that's just not the way it was in the beginning. And this whole age that we're living in is a is a going back age and and the curse of the age. I think brother Paul or one of the brothers here preached on it was about modernism and everything's getting so modern. And so Satan has always used the eyes to attract. Remember when Eve saw the fruit, she saw that it was a good it was appealing to her eye. Now the word doesn't appeal to your eye. It only appeals to the seed &gt;&gt; that's in you. So, you know, when we start bypassing that, so I should be able to come up here and say, uh, November 12th, 13th, and 14th, we're having a our annual meeting, uh, Brother Ray will, and we'll be ministering. Uh, uh, uh, father and son by the grace of the Lord, Lord willing, and, uh, we just want you to know about it. I would hope that the Holy Spirit would come down and say, "You need to go to that meeting or or I want to be there." You know what I mean? But if I put a buffet up here, you know, show the barbecue, you know what I mean? and then show all the activities and you know show then then now you're dealing with what's motivating your choice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you you see what I'm saying? So, I'm not against any of that, but I'm just saying that we've got to find real clarity within ourselves of what motivates our choices, what's stimulating us, what's speaking to us. And as a pastor, you know that uh that we're concerned because this is the age of many, many voices. And there's just so much coming at you. And everybody wants you to make a decision or a judgment. And a lot of things you don't have to make a decision on. Just ignore them is the best thing. But anyway, I sorry I kept you standing, but I'm going to keep you seated for a long time. So, we're trying to balance it out. Let's open our Bibles here, and I'll find my scripture uh here in in Romans. um uh sixth um chapter of Romans and we'll read our scripture and we'll start our Sunday school uh lesson today and um so as we read we'll go we can might as well just start at the first verse of Romans. It never hurts to read our scripture. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism unto death. that like as Christ was risen up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so are we also should walk in the newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is free from sin. God bless you. You may be seated this morning. you know, in in the most all of uh Brother Brandham's sermons and messages and dealing with the church and preaching to the church, he always tries to get the church to go back to the beginning. So go back to where it started. Uh even when you want to get renew your life in the Lord Jesus and maybe you've gone through a period of backsliding. You've quit reading your Bible. You've got involved in the world. Uh maybe you've you've drifted and you've got cold and informal and and you're you're you're just not serving God the way that it satisfies your heart. I'm sure we've all been there. Uh if if a man says he hasn't sinned, he's a liar. You know what I mean? But but what we do is you say, "How do I get back to that?" Well, you have to go. So you want to get back to where you were, you got to go back to where you left them. &gt;&gt; And and so as the church began to progress, we know that the church in the beginning at Pentecost, the the church was formed at Pentecost. The the disciples were gathered in an upper room. They were uh afraid uh their they had given their lives and changed the way that they were living and they left what they were doing and begin to follow and help in the ministry of Jesus Christ. They they went out made announcements. They went out praying for the sick and going to different towns letting everybody know that he was here on the earth. The ministry was moving. People were coming into the ministry to uh to be to see him. 5,000 showed up. His disciples helped feed them. So, they had given their lives to the to the ministry. And then when all of a sudden he was taken from them and they were astonished that he didn't resist that he didn't fight back. you you know what I mean? Uh that he didn't call 10,000 angels like that song. He could have called 10,000 angels. And and Jesus said that to Pilate. He said, "If my kingdom were of this world, my armies would have come and fought for me, but my kingdom is not of this world." And uh so when they went out and they were in the upper room, Jesus told them, "Go there. Come back here. stay there and wait because I am going to visit you. I will send you another comforter. And and a lot of times people get that word another mixed up. It's I'm going to send you a comforter in a different form. You know what I mean? There's not another God. But God is immorph. He takes on different form. So he he was with him. So he said, "I'll be with you even in you till the end. I will come again that where I am, you may be also." So when he said in the upper room, he said, "I'm I'm I'm going to send you another comforter." He says, "I'm going to come to you in a different form. I'm here with you in the flesh, but now I'm going to show up. It's going to be me in spirit form. It's going to be me, and I am going to empower you. I am going to come down and meet with you and fill you and you are going to experience the experience of the inddwelling presence of my spirit in you. &gt;&gt; And so they went to the upper room and they prayed and all of a sudden clothing tongues of fire broke up. They knew that he was there. They they they knew it was him and they knew they were filled with his power and his strength. They had just received the same power that raised Jesus from the dead. If the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you, it will also quicken your mortal body. So now they were there. They were afraid. They were there in their belief, in their faith, in their strength, in their decision. But now they had no confidence in that. &gt;&gt; But he said, "I'm going to strengthen you. I'm going to come again and be with you, even in you to end. I will come in another form, another comforter. I you I'm with you now." And you find comfort. but I go away. But you will know I am in the Father and the Father in me and I in you. &gt;&gt; So So he he was laying that out to us. And that was the beginning of the church. That's what the church was built on. It was built on the the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, the same spirit that raised him from the dead coming and dwelling in a believer. And there was a pathway to that. And and on the day of Pentecost that it was obvious to those that were there witnessing that that something had transpired, that there was something there that was different. And they inquired, "Men and brethren, what must we do? What we hear you speaking in our own tongues? People are getting well. Your your your presence is here. We sense that. Uh we thought you were drunk, but you were so moved in the spirit and you you quickly referred us to the scriptures. This these men are not drunk as you suppose. But this is what was prophesied by Joel that I'll pour out my spirit upon my sons and daughters. And and and there were those there that saw it. And remember, there's always seers and nonseers. &gt;&gt; There's always believers and non-believers. &gt;&gt; There was people that were caught in the middle. They didn't know what to believe. They wanted to believe it, but yet they felt the pull of the unbelievers. They felt the pull of believers. And they always remained in that constant flux. uh the scripture even say choose this day whom you're going to serve but as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord. So that decision has never left man. Man always finds themsself caught between those two places. Uh it's very difficult. Many believers sometimes have been involved in churches and false doctrines and and all kinds of things. They've built their lifestyle in it and then their eyes are opened and and it's a terrible battle of leaving those things which are behind and moving forward into something new. Even when you leave sin and you leave the world, it you've got so many friends, so many habits, so many ways of life, so many lifestyles that that it's difficult to make that transition. But but so in the beginning that was the beginning of the church and our messenger always continually. So even when they asked Jesus the great question about marriage and divorce uh and they wanted to know his answer to them was it wasn't so from the beginning. So let us go back to the beginning and if we go back to the beginning then we can understand what is transpiring and so that's where my heart is. You notice I last Wednesday night we played the the uh video that the full gospel businessmen had put out. They were trying to raise funds and and send the prophet of God to Israel. They thought that that they would convert the Jews. Um and of course, Brother Brandham evangelistic heart doing the work of evangelists. He said, "Yes, I I would I think this ministry would help bring many Jews to the Lord." But then, as you know, the Lord spoke to him and said that God's got a plan for them. and uh and his being the Elijah that he was, there was a portion of him that felt that plan. And so if I I would interject a lot of things here, but I I I believe this message will go to Israel. You you and uh so because it's the truth. &gt;&gt; So um you can go run with that wherever you want. So, uh, but I'm pretty happy with what I see. So, um, but so if we go back to the beginning, so this is what I I want to kind of make sure that you understand because nowadays everybody's trying to either want you to be for or against you. Are you against this? Are you against that? Am I against shouting in the church? No. The Holy Ghost can shout all he wants. If he wants to use you to shout, I'm all for it. But I don't really care for your shouting. &gt;&gt; So, it's got a completely different sound. It's got a one one. Yeah, I won't go there. All right. I'm I'm I'm all for worship. Don't let anybody ever think I don't want you to raise your hands, praise God, let tears uh come down. Yeah. You know what I mean? If it's the spirit of God moves on you, um then we want that to be there. You know, we we want it to come to you spiritually. We don't want it to be produced. &gt;&gt; We want it to be bore. We want it to be because of the spirit, because of the opening of of your heart and the move of the spirit of God on you. So, we're we're not against this, we're not against this or against that or for this way and for that way. uh we just want what's truth &gt;&gt; and and so we and and so that's why I I wanted to go back to the beginning and I think a lot of times you've got to go back to the beginning to understand where you are now. You you don't know how far off course you are unless you understand your starting point. And that's what was so beautiful about the north star, you know, is that the north, the evening star, and the morning star were the same star. You could always know where you were at by that star, but you had to go back to that star to get your bearings. So, you know, if you're lost, in order to get your bearings, you know what your bearing is? your direction, your straight line. You have to go back to the beginning to know where you started from in order to get the straight line to where you're going. And and so you and and there's no other way but God's provided way to do that. And and I I've been in the message now for so many years. I don't think that matters. I'm being constantly reminded by everybody around me that I'm one of the elders now, you know, and I think that's totally debatable. But um uh this thing may have a lot of years on it, but this thing in here is just getting started. So, uh, uh, and I've seen a lot, you know, I have there's most all the ministry that I started out with, the guys that preached, the guys that were in brother Brandon's meetings. I was very fortunate as a young man coming into the message and right around 1970, right in that four or five month period in there to meet most of those gentlemen. And I I noticed they all had a certain nature about him because the prophet of God had an effect on him. &gt;&gt; The way that he was had an effect on him and just the the prog the progress of things. And so that's why the I I I played this the tape Wednesday night tonight. Uh we hope you come back. I I I don't know what u event is going on this evening. Uh why you wouldn't come back. Uh um we've offered to buy your gas. We've offered to get your lunch if you need it. But for for whatever reason, or maybe you just don't like Sunday night church. That's all right. You can doesn't matter to me. here. If you don't like church, uh uh I understand. You know what I mean? Uh I go to a lot of church, you know what I mean? So, but we're going to play this evening the film from Washington DC called The Deep Call to the Deep. That's around the time of Congressman Upshaw's healing and and those times. And the reason for that is to remind us and bring us back to the beginning. You understand that? To bring us back to the beginning so we can understand what was our foundation. What were we built on? What what was what where did we come from? And we're gonna look at that through the eyes of the scriptures this morning. And we're gonna and if you want to get a a wonderful message that has a lot of what I'm talking about in it, it's the sermon called marriage and divorce. And so we know that in the beginning God created the heaven and earth. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; In the beginning. And and as he formed the earth, he separated the earth and he separated light and darkness. And we understood right from the beginning that God was a separator. He always separates. He always separates light from dark. We know that he's doing that today. He's doing that this morning. There's some of you that are living in darkness and the wages of sin is death. And what God wants to do is separate you from that darkness and bring you into the light. So God uh he he he trying to deal uh with that because he wants to separate you from darkness. He wants to he's a separator from life and death. The wages of sin is death. The gift of God is eternal life. So we know that God's a separator. That's what he does. He's continually separating. He doesn't stop separating. What man thinks is that man made one separating decision. I I've separated from this. I'm done separating. Now I'm going to continue in my own way, my own thinking, my own judgments, my own way of doing things. And they they they feel because they've made one separation that that's the end of it. No. Uh God continues to separate all the way from the day that he separates you from this mortal body and this mortal world. And so there's final separations and the great judgment of the separating and of the sheep and the goats will be the final separation. The final judgment. He says, "But until that day with before the church is caught up in the glory, there's going to be one more great separation and that's separating the sheep from the goats." And so we know that that separation is there. So in the beginning, God separated it. And then God created a son, Adam. Adam was the first son of God. He was a living soul and that's what he was. He was the son of God. And so we know we put him in a garden. And we know the story. We go back to the angels that that saw God's plan. And Lucifer looked and saw what God's plan for redemption was, what God's plan for a kingdom was, what God's plan for a people was. The kind of nature that he wanted th that people to have, the kind of spirit he wanted those people to be in, the kind of personality that he wanted them to have, their nature, their life, their heart's desire, their mind, their thinking. And Lucifer saw that and thought, "What a waste." &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? He said, "No." So he he he deceived threearters of the heaven. God knowing all allowing all this we won't go there because he felt that he could build a better kingdom. In other words, God wasn't going to use mathematics. &gt;&gt; Yet every star, every molecule is the most fabulous mathematical genius that you would ever see. You could find God in mathematics. Einstein found God in mathematics. &gt;&gt; And and and and God wasn't going to use science. You know what I mean? And yet there was so much science there that Satan knew how things work, what chemicals will do. Uh you you remember he he was a a great angel. He, you know, and God wasn't going to use that and he wasn't going to use any of these things. He he wasn't going to have a civilization here. And Satan thought, you built all this sky, you built all this great thing, you put this great earth there, you have all these me chemicals in it, you have all this knowledge, you have all this math, you have all this science, and you're not going to use any of it. What a waste, you know, because he he knew that if man done those things that they could become like gods, but it wasn't what was in God's heart. Wasn't what God wanted to be. He He didn't want to be a scientist. God didn't didn't want to build a civilization. God wanted to be a father. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that how do we pray? He didn't say our our scientist, you know, our our great cultural thing. He said our father. And so Satan left that. And he decided and was cast out. And then he found his way back into the Garden of Eden. And we know that Satan now is the father of lies. He's the father of all lies. He's a liar. Okay? So if it comes from Satan's mouth, it's a lie, you know. And I'm not going to throw all attorneys under the bus. That's what they say about a lawyer. How do you know if a lawyer's lying if he moves his lips? Well, that doesn't apply to lawyers. It only applies to one person, and that's the father of lies. Because there's no truth in them. The reason there's no truth in Satan, he still believes his own deception. &gt;&gt; He still believes he can rule. &gt;&gt; He still believes he's going to have a kingdom. He still believes he's going to exalt himself and sit on the throne that he felt belonged to him. And when God chose to manifest himself in a simple Galilean by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, he thought that was absurdity. But God had a plan. And Satan never could understand that part of God's plan &gt;&gt; because God was gonna reveal it himself. And so we know that that Satan was the father of &gt;&gt; all lies. And you are the result of the first lie. &gt;&gt; Now you say, Not me. Uhhuh. You you in this &gt;&gt; is a result of a lie. The scripture expressed it this way. We are all born in sin, &gt;&gt; shaped in iniquity, and came into the world &gt;&gt; speaking lies. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would somebody come into the world, just a child, no reason for nothing, and you say, "Johnny, did you get in the cookie jar?" And he'll be holding a cookie. He's got chocolate chips all running down his face. He's got crumbs on. No, not me. I'm not didn't get in the cookie jar. And he having no knowledge of even what a lie is, he speaks a lie. You say, "Well, he came into the world speaking lies." He came into the world speaking lies because that's the nature he received of the father of lies. And we know going in that the reason for that was is because of serpent seed and that lie and that act that brought us all into the world. We received the nature of that lie. You understand that? the nature that that we received that that uh that that lie uh uh uh well we are a result of that lie and and uh and what does a lie do? A lie withholds the truth. We could say it's a perversion of the truth, but it wi withholds the truth. The lie withholds the truth. And when Satan got Eve and interjected that lie, now the truth was withheld from everybody. &gt;&gt; And the truth didn't show back up until it was prophesied to show up. And one came on the scene and said, "I am the way, the truth, the life. &gt;&gt; No man comes to the father but by me. And so because of that lie uh we all got an earthly father &gt;&gt; and the nature of sin. So we're born with this nature. And so like I was fellowship with Gary, brother Orlando, a few of the brothers. So and we were talking and so the we we were born to our natural fathers. Now, I didn't pick my parents. &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? I mean, if I if I would have looked over the catalog of parents and they could have picked a parent, I would have looked down and, you know, I think probably uh uh you know, great names were would come up, you know, uh maybe uh very wealthy people and that lived in really great places. But I didn't pick my parents. God picked them. &gt;&gt; But I didn't know that that the lie hid that from me. The lie hides the truth. And so we we we grew up uh visiting with brother Gary. I said, "Gary, you I think that Gary was born somewhere in Texas here. I I know his parents live in Weatherford now. I don't know what much about before, but uh but his dad was a mechanic, a a good hardworking fella and and he chose where Gary lived. He taught Gary what food to eat because he put it on the table. And yet when you're hungry and you eat something, the memory of the satisfaction of that hunger becomes a part of you. If if you wanted scientific and understanding, it's an endorphin. &gt;&gt; It's a something your body generates to cause good feelings. And that's what people do. They they they they get addicted to the endorphine. They get addicted to that that chemical that is created. So they go through certain actions that create that chemical. So they can get that feeling and it leads to drug addiction. It leads to sexual addiction. It leads to uh uh alcoholism. It leads to a lot of things. It it's created there. It's part of the lie. &gt;&gt; So we found out that that we were born. And so he Gary became what he did because his father taught him maybe certain pizza or certain food or certain way to drink coffee. You know these all these different ways that were presented. You know I go in places and people like hot stuff. They like bitter stuff, sour stuff. And I thought, how how in the world did you ever get a taste of that? Well, when they were sitting at the table starved and mama stuck some sour old junk in in their mouth, to them it was like, "Hallelujah. This is great. This satisfies me." And they have a craving for it. They long for it. They They desire it. Okay, they're raised with it. So now they're being formed and molded by our earthly father or by our natural nature. We've got this nature. &gt;&gt; We've got it from our from it was passed down to us through genes through through uh being taught culture taught. It's not inherited. So you know my political views, my work views, my work ethic was all taught to me by my father. What it meant to work, what it meant to do this, how how I thought. So much of that was taught to me by my earthly father and became. So I got that nature of my father, my natural father. We have that nature. We were born that with that nature. So we we came into our this life with that nature. And so but that is not our true nature. But that nature came from a seed. Do you understand that? It came from the natural seed of my father to the bedding ground of my mother. And through the design of of God's plan, it formed me. And because of that natural seed, I I was birthed to my father and my mother. And now they raised me. They brought me up in their values, their culture. I was raised a Catholic. That couldn't I didn't know anything. I was raised a Catholic, but I wasn't a Catholic, &gt;&gt; but I was raised one. I pursued it with everything that I had. I pursued being a Catholic, even to the consideration of of being a priest, you know, I I thought that was the way to go. And so I pursued the that nature, that natural part of me. But there but that wasn't who that if I could say that that's a nature I'm born with. But and that came from a seed. But remember, a lie hides the truth. And then when the gospel came, it was the revelation to you that you are not really stuck to that seed or nature. Okay? That's what Jesus said. I'm the truth. My sheep hear my voice &gt;&gt; and another they will not follow. &gt;&gt; And so the reality was that not only did we have and were living by the seed of our parents in the natural realm of five senses. Unless you have some form of um I want to use a word uh I don't want to use the word defect. I don't want to use the word handicap. I maybe that one of your sensuses wasn't developed and maybe you only have four or five you and you make all the adaptions. That's not the point. The point is that those those inner emotions and their outer emotions all came from the flesh and they rule over you. Okay? So you're married to them without your knowledge. You you you you have a union with them. You're in union with them right off the bat. When you grew up, you were in union with a lie. If you mean, you were you were born a liar, right? You came into the world shaped in iniquity. You did things that weren't right. You were married to that nature. You're stuck with that nature. You were born with that nature. And that nature ruled over you. You were ruled by that nature. That nature had control of you. And then Jesus wanted to come and tell you that you have another seed in you. &gt;&gt; That was the original seed. &gt;&gt; That was the seed that God put there from the beginning. That seed is in you. So you say, "Well, am I two persons? my two personalities. No, you you you you're ruled by that nature. So you and that nature are one now. And by the laws, you're married to that. So I want you to understand that you're married to that nature. Whether you use I know people that are so sweet all the time, but if a certain thing happens and they get in a certain place, somebody plugs in the buzz saw, [Music] you know, and then when they're all done, oh, I'm so sorry. You know what I mean? Oh, well, just the nature &gt;&gt; you were married to that. But the gospel comes to let us know that that nature can die. &gt;&gt; And so if you want to know what I would title my message this morning, it's called Faith in Your Death. Faith in your death. I hope you understand that because you've got to understand that that nature has died. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And if you're still battling the nature, then it's not dead yet. Now, you if you've killed a lot of the old man, don't stop until you kill all of it. &gt;&gt; Okay? Now I want just to read some scriptures with you and then I'll close up uh here with you. So we just read Romans uh six and and and seven. He says, "Knowing this, knowing this, right, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is free from sin. So we have to have faith in our death. We we don't put a lot of times we talk about we fa we don't want to put our faith in in an evangelist. We don't want to put our faith in a church. We we don't want to be put our faith in what our eyes sees moving in a midst of the people. You have to have faith that you have died. &gt;&gt; You have got to know that some place in your life, your nature has made a change. &gt;&gt; You didn't add religion to your nature. You didn't add good works to the old man. It's not good works controlling the old man. That my brother who spent many years in aa Uh that was always our biggest argument is he he didn't believe an alcoholic could be healed. He believed he could be controlled. You know what I mean? That and people think, well, I can quit using drugs or I can quit doing this. I can quit any time that I want to. But that doesn't mean it's dead. It means it's under control. &gt;&gt; It's been caged up. &gt;&gt; And if it's caged up, it's continually trying to find a way to get out. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's going to want to kill you. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's like a death oath it takes when you close it up. I'm going when I get out of here, I'm going to get you. I'm coming for you. I'm I'm I'm going to I'm I'm going to get alive. He'll work long range plans. He'll do all kinds of things. He'll try to get you, but that he's caged up, but he's not dead. &gt;&gt; So, you you I hope you understand where I'm going. You've got to have faith in your death &gt;&gt; that my heart no longer has a desire for these things. &gt;&gt; It's not I know it's wrong and I'm going to stay away from it. No, I I believe me, I I I don't have cigarette smoking caged up. I don't desire a smoke. You know, I I when I somebody lights up a cigar, I don't go. Oh, I can't smoke. Oh, I made up my mind. I wasn't going to smoke. I'm serving God. I'm just not going to smoke. No. When a cigar lights up and I go and the next thing I do is go, &gt;&gt; sorry for the graphics. No, it makes me what? Sick. &gt;&gt; I have no desire for it. &gt;&gt; So I can say to you, cigarette smoking is dead to me. &gt;&gt; Alcohol is dead to me. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I don't want to drink. I just don't want to drink. &gt;&gt; It's not that. Can you drink? I suppose I could go through a long litany of scriptural research and probably come up with a dozen reasons why I could drink a little wine for my stomach. Say, "Everybody that ever has done that has always had a stomach ache ever since I met them." Their stomach just continually bothers them. Boy, I'm more my stomach. I tell you what, I got Oh, you going? Yeah. And before I eat this meal, I got to have a little wine for my stomach's sake. You know what I mean? Well, you know, if they ever got healed, the stomach, I guess the drinking would go right. So, but I have no desire to drink. &gt;&gt; Now, that but those things are dead to me and I have faith that those things are dead. But there's still a lot of things that are trying to resurrect. Maybe not all my nature is killed. Maybe there's a lot more that I can go forward. So let's turn to Corinthian 2 Corinthians 5:17. We Let's go back just to the 14th verse. Well, I got to read 13 because that's just my nature. I I read the Bible backwards. He says, "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God, or whether we be sober, it is for your cause." For the love of Christ constrained us, because we thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead. and and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh. Yay, though we know Christ after the flesh, we now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away, and behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconiliation. So we know that we we see here that if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; So Paul just talks to us here about the death of the old man. This man is dead. All things become new to us. Now if you don't if you're not have confidence in that death and faith in the death, then then things can't become new to you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because this old you're afraid of your old nature. &gt;&gt; You You can't go on thinking, "Oh, I I'm afraid that this will pop up." &gt;&gt; You know, if you're healed, you're not afraid it's going to pop up. You know, it's gone. You know it's dead. &gt;&gt; So, I'm talking about a nature. There's a nature that we got that we were married to and the only way we can be divorced from that nature is if it dies. There's not a rit of divorcement that you can give to them. That means that thing is still living but you are not participating in it. But we have got to build our faith on death. My Christian faith is built on death. &gt;&gt; I I I believe that he died &gt;&gt; for my sins. &gt;&gt; That his death is what paid the price for my sins. I have to have faith in his death. &gt;&gt; His death was the payment for my sins. If I don't believe he died, then I don't believe he died for my sins, therefore my sins. That's what he said. If we know him after the flesh, then no more. You know, so we've got to understand that our faith is built on his death. And our life, our new man, our new creature, our new nature is based on his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you have to have faith in his death before you could have faith in the life of the resurrection coming into you. &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith that you're dead &gt;&gt; and that you have a right &gt;&gt; to the new life &gt;&gt; to be a new creature &gt;&gt; cuz the old creature's dead. that it's so fundamental, but it's something that's slipping away from the church and I'm going somewhere. So, let's just read Ephesians 4 and uh Ephesians 4 and 20. See if I had this right. He says, "But if ye have but ye have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard him and and have been taught by him, as the truth is Jesus, that ye put off concerning the former conversations of the old man, which is corrupt, according to deceitfulness, and be and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that ye put on the new man, &gt;&gt; which after God is created in the righteousness and holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the old man is dead &gt;&gt; and you put on the righteousness of the new man. &gt;&gt; You You understand what Satan's done? He's got in the middle of everything. &gt;&gt; Then he's watered everything down. He's polluted everything. He's presenting all kinds of new stimulation, all kinds of new attractions, all kinds of things that are pleasing to the eye. If and they and we just read in the scripture, if you've heard him, &gt;&gt; and everything's trying to move the visuals, &gt;&gt; fantastics, &gt;&gt; it's all becoming entertainment. And now our faith is starting to get built in our senses. &gt;&gt; On feelings and our faith should be in our death. &gt;&gt; I know that I died here. &gt;&gt; This is where I quit drinking. &gt;&gt; This is where I quit smoking. This is the day I threw it out the window and I never ever went back there today. I have total faith &gt;&gt; that that was the end of it for me. &gt;&gt; You don't drive back by that spot and roll down your window and look up and say, "I wonder if it's still out there. It's been five years, but you know, I still have the memory of it." &gt;&gt; No. by the renewing &gt;&gt; of your mind. By the washing of the water of God's word, &gt;&gt; you guys know I I I died. I have faith in my death. &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in your death. We we read here uh we could go to uh second Corinthians back to Corinthians uh four and and uh 16. We'll go start with 14. Where we go? We might as well go to 12. So then death workketh in us, but life in you. We have the same spirit of faith, according is written, I believe, and therefore have I spoken. We also believe, therefore speak, knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Christ Jesus, and shall present us with you. All for all things are for your sake, that the abundant grace might might through the thanksgiving of many rebound in the glory of God. For this cause we faint not, but our outward man perish, but the inward man is renewed day by day. the outward man perish. Now, we know Paul's in affliction. He's suffering. He's saying this outward man's dying. But this inward man, &gt;&gt; he's got faith in what transpired in his life on that road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; Oh, Agria, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. I would that you would be even as I. Now he's suffering for his death and then he can start making s statements like if we suffer with him will reign with him. &gt;&gt; He's he's confident. He knows his experience. He's knows his calling. He has faith in his death. &gt;&gt; And I I wonder if we really started getting real because we really want to go forward, don't we? We want to get back. God provided a way for every believer to meet him. And that's under the shed blood. The shed blood is death. [Music] man died, &gt;&gt; showing us that this fleshly body and the nature that came with it can also die &gt;&gt; and that a new creature can be resurrected in Christ Jesus. All things become new. &gt;&gt; All old things have passed away &gt;&gt; and all things become new. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how can they become new?" because the other thing has passed away. It's died. &gt;&gt; We've got that. Let's just read a last scripture, then I'll close. We're just laying this down as some seed. Galatians 5 and 24. And they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affle afflictions afflictions and lust. For if we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Once again is the reference to death. Faith in your death. You've got to have faith that that old nature has died. Now, I just going to make a transition here and just be honest with you. When I first came into the message, almost everybody that was in the message had come out of Pentecost. They all spoke in tongues. They all had great emotional movements of the spirit. They all felt that tongues was the evidence of the Holy Spirit. They they had different ideas of baptism. uh but they all basically felt that the evidence of the Holy Spirit was a sensation. That's how they judged it. Therefore, they used whatever method they could use to create that sensation. Music started to become a big part of it. certain songs emotions were done in a lot of different ways. Some of it was creating the the tear. You know, my mama said to me, "Son, is on her deathbed. You take this gospel to the lost. Mama, I've never let you down." Why? you're already emotional. You're getting sucked right in. They worked on emotion and then they started using greater songs to create joy and emotion. But they were always driving to a feeling, to a sensation, something that their senses that the old man could attach to. But if that old man is dead, it can attach to that. So if the seed of your first father, the one that brought you here is dead, the only seed that remains should be the rece seed of your heavenly father. Now once this one is dead, this one can now live &gt;&gt; and it's got to grow. So everybody came out of Pentecost and there was excitement in one way and nobody wanted to be a part of it because they knew it was based on sensation. So they were hungry for what that he taught because there was a stark evidence. Brother Van didn't run from one end of the stage and I'm not against the guys that want to run from the stage. I'm jealous. you you know what I mean? And I maybe covered a little more ground in my younger years, but that's not my point. But my point was it was driven by the sensation. And so none of the brothers that I came out with, none of them they they didn't want to lean that way because they leaned to the example that they had. Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ. They were very conscious because they sat there and we watched it in the meeting the other day on the tape and you'll see it again tonight. The mannerism and the spirit here is God in his the most powerful anointing that's been on the earth since the days of the Lord Jesus Christ just standing there. &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, I see you. You've got heart trouble." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I I I see a black sheep. It's a lie. Somebody's told a lie on you and it stirred up your church and your pastors got polio. They said you were a witch. Nobody jumped out. &gt;&gt; Nobody come flying out. Didn't you see anybody come flying out of the seats? No, everybody was in shock, &gt;&gt; you know, because what they knew. If he knows that about &gt;&gt; her, &gt;&gt; what does he know about me? &gt;&gt; Remember we read that quote out of in his presence, he said there would be such a holy hush on the audience that people would get out of the prayer line and come to the altar and make things right. I just wanted you to see the mannerism in which the word of God was being presented. Now, I can't duplicate that. Nobody can duplicate that. You've got to be yourself. So, when when it came out, but then what happened is is the message began to spread. younger people that weren't in the meetings came out of Pentecost and they brought their Pentecostal style of preaching to the church and the people were attracted to it. They had that way of emotion. They had more word to study and they begin to do it and they begin to create something that's very obvious to me that they would read a quote with emotion and the people would respond. But yet you could read the quote or play the quote. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Nobody jumped out of their seats. &gt;&gt; Nobody came down and stood up in front of you and went. &gt;&gt; They didn't do it. &gt;&gt; You notice I came down out of the Just wanted to let you know it killed me, but I made it. A new thing started to rise up. &gt;&gt; A new group of ministers came in. They were out of Pentecost. They brought their Pentecostal style with them. It's all they knew. I'm not against it. It's great. But the people weren't responding to the word. You could play the quote. I want you to be aware of this because I want you to totally understand as a pastor, you don't have to sit under this ministry. We got enough preachers in here, they can go start their own thing. But I want you to know for clear the way &gt;&gt; and and the response was more towards the emotion than towards the word towards the feeling because that's what our nature is given to. And so then another generation came of ministry rose up and they saw the result of this style of preaching and they all began to take on this style of preaching and now it became a style and the style is promoted greater than the word. Watch this style of preaching. will show you the style of preaching. This style of preaching. This style of preaching. Now, you you can't have my style of preaching out because I bore you to death. And I and I don't want to be entertaining. &gt;&gt; What I want to leave you with is the truth. &gt;&gt; Then a whole another group of guys and they're and now they're they're all imitating the other style. And how far is it going to get away if we keep going on? &gt;&gt; So that's why we played those things. And I'm going to read a statement so you understand that what I'm seeing I'm seeing us getting farther and farther away from what was presented to us in the nature in the personality in the approach and the mental thinking of our messenger to the church. That's why that we play tapes is so that you can hear his message. You can sense his manner. You can see his emphasis. You can be identified. Now I want you to see the importance of why it's important to identify with the mannerism in which God presented himself &gt;&gt; and I'm going to read a quotation. You can put it on the board, brother. Well, it's all I I don't have a quote a paragraph in the book I'm using but it's out of the rising of the sun and you know brother Bram talks about who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the w word was made flesh and dwelt among us and all of the teachings that we have we have and confirmation of the word of God by the word of God by signs and wonders. We see today in the book of Luke here that we quoted Luke 17:30 uh 17:30 and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word again is waved over the people that the dead traditions of man and the son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost among amongst us and is given us life &gt;&gt; as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth all through types in many places. He was the first fruit of those who slept in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church. There will have to be a sheath wave again in the last days. Oh my. You know, a lot of people talk about the bride coming of Christ, but they left out the sheath wave. &gt;&gt; They left out the sheath wave. Now hear this. You hear a lot the bright coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Read it all. &gt;&gt; The bride coming of Christ was based on a sheath offering. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Based on a sheath offering. Let's continue to read so you understand. I'm not against the shouting. &gt;&gt; I'm not against the emotional preaching. I'm against you grabbing on to it and having faith in it and not having faith in your death. &gt;&gt; It's not a substitute for you dying. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're happy that you're dead, then I'm with you. If you're happy, if you're dead, let them know. If you're happy and you're dead, let them know. I'm so happy that I'm dead. I'm so happy that I'm dead. I'm going to go to heaven instead. &gt;&gt; I ought to get that song I wrote the other day, Sister Rebecca. Right. You got that? All right. He says, "As Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets, two types and places, he was the first fruit of those that slept. In the bride coming of Christ, the coming out of the church, there'll have to be a sheath wave again in the last days." Oh my. Waving of the sheath. What was the sheath? The first one to come to maturity. The first one that proved it was a wheat &gt;&gt; that proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you see what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; It was waved over the people. And the first time there will come forth for a bride age for a resurrection out of the dark denominationalism will be a message. that the full ministry of the word has turned back again into its full full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders he did back there. Because I live, ye live also. Speaking to his wife, Because I live, ye live also. What a resurrection that was. What a resurrection this is. To be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ by God's quickening power. He was waved to waved to them. The word which he was was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost. The word made manifest and as I said it is to be waved again in the last day. &gt;&gt; So now the resurrection life and all that was based on the sheath offering which was what? the first one to come to maturity, letting everybody else know we're going to come to that maturity. &gt;&gt; Now, you can't bypass the maturity. &gt;&gt; You can't bypass the ripening of the sun. &gt;&gt; And then you know what? He goes into the very next thing he talks about the Cadillac, the automobile because the sheath offering was the spark to the gasoline. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a a Holy Ghost anointed baptism because the prophet of God taught the mystery of this age was to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without a sensation. &gt;&gt; What was it? It was the revelation of your death &gt;&gt; and that a new seed, &gt;&gt; the seed of your father, &gt;&gt; the seed that he put there before the beginning of time, had the power within itself by the germination of the spark, the sheath offering to bring itself into what it was predestinated to be. You know what the sheath offering was &gt;&gt; it was the manifestation of you. &gt;&gt; It was showing you what you were because he was the first son &gt;&gt; to come to maturity. &gt;&gt; And we're leaving that out. We're removing that from our gospel. &gt;&gt; We're removing his voice. &gt;&gt; We're removing his example. We're removing his mannerism. We're removing his conduct. And we're substituting it back with the emotions of Pentecost. You can have it. &gt;&gt; I'm not going there. &gt;&gt; There's death in the pot. You have the sheep offering waved over you. &gt;&gt; I'm not that guy. &gt;&gt; No preachers that guy. No style of preaching. &gt;&gt; No songs, nothing. It's fine. Deal with the emotion part, but separate it. Have faith in your death. Don't let those things resurrect and old feelings and old emotional religion. &gt;&gt; I am who I am because he said so. were built on what he said and he we just read it in the last days the one that comes to maturity Malachi 4:5 who was this it was none other than the word &gt;&gt; a human body flesh born in sin just like us having the word of God veiled in it and standing there it was the unveiling of God it It was the nature of the original seed being presented to you that you could sit there and see not, oh, that's what I should be. Oh, I'm so terrible. I'm not dead yet. But no, I can be. &gt;&gt; I may not do that work, but that's my nature. &gt;&gt; That's the way I think. &gt;&gt; That's the way I believe. That's the way I make my determinations on my decisions. That's the way I process information. That's my heart's desire. This is what I I I I am motivated to become because that's what God waved over me. He didn't wave Pentecost over me. He didn't wave all kinds of preaching. What he waved was the ministry of Malachi 4:5 and God's servant prophet William Mary and Brandham. And I say we need to go back to that. what he waved. &gt;&gt; He didn't wave a bunch of young evangelisms. &gt;&gt; He didn't wave a bunch of old pastors. He waved Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he waved. If you can hear me, you can hear him. &gt;&gt; You say, "Do you believe in press play?" Yes, sir. I believe in press play. The only thing they did is they added one word. They said, "Just." &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan did in the beginning. He added what? One word. If we know we're dead, then we know we'll be risen with him. &gt;&gt; So if you know you've died when something else starts to pop up in your life, start killing it. &gt;&gt; Start starving it. Be aware that sin creates sin for a season brings pleasure. I don't want to sound like a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but it's a known fact that it's the endorphins that sometimes that sensation of fear or that sensation of challenge. You know, why does a guy go down the highway 110 miles an hour miles an hour on his back tire? I'm more afraid than he is. I get a real rush when he goes by me. But it's it's creating a sensation in him that he's hungering for. And pretty soon certain music, certain songs, you start attaching to the song. I I'm going to finish this morning. You go back to the 40s and the 50s and you watch anybody who sang, they all stood at the microphone. They were what we called kuners, right? Frank Sinatra, right? No, the big band, you know, they were all there. You might say, "Oh, you're preaching awful carnal." No, I'm talking to the carnal. Remember, the carnal mind is immity with God, &gt;&gt; but the spiritual mind is life. They all stood there. You know when that all changed? When Alvis Presley started coming, he went to Congo and he learned how to dance. And then he brought it back and put it on the American stage, you know, doing all his stuff and And &gt;&gt; everybody ate it up &gt;&gt; and it all went wild &gt;&gt; and it's been going wild ever since &gt;&gt; and now you got I guess they call them headbangers and all this you know it wasn't way it was no he just keeps getting more sensational and more attracted to emotion and more attracted to sensation. So if God didn't give us an example, we would have been taken all over the place. &gt;&gt; So we know that we've got to be divorced &gt;&gt; from our first nature. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be divorced is for it to die. You can't write it a divorce. It's got to die. Now, he wrote the church world a divorcement. He indicted them. He told them, "You don't represent me. You don't stand for me. You don't preach what I preach. You don't resent ex resent me in any way. It ain't a rock concert. We go to our meetings now, they're fullfledged all blowing on rock concerts, &gt;&gt; Christian rock concerts. It's nothing to do. He's divorced it. &gt;&gt; He's put it away. He's not has any part of it. &gt;&gt; He's not even in there. He's on the outside trying to get back in. &gt;&gt; But at least we know his sheep, my sheep, hear my voice. &gt;&gt; So what was the voice to us in the last day? What did God give us? He gave us a sheath offering. He put a ministry that he promised in the word to be there so we could look, we could hear, and we could know &gt;&gt; that this was him. &gt;&gt; This is out, brother Mike. This is out of marriage and divorce. Um, paragraph 258. I better not go there. I'd open another. Let's just start with 258. He says, so he's talking, if we just to lay it, he's talking about in the Bible, people that refuse to receive the the seed of their husband, how that they were put away. It says, but we don't aren't going that way. He says, "So, so is it with the church that refuses to become pregnantated in the age that we now live in?" Now, you keep, we all talk about being impregnated with the word, but he's wanting to let you know something. He's talking about you got to be impregnated with the age &gt;&gt; you're living in. The word for the age, &gt;&gt; he said through the age that we now live in to bring forth children of this age. &gt;&gt; How do we know what the children of this age looks like? &gt;&gt; He was waved in front of us. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is what he looks like. &gt;&gt; This is what he acts like. &gt;&gt; This is how he talks. This listen to this quote closely. And believe me, this sermon this morning is going to get a lot of push back, &gt;&gt; but I don't care. &gt;&gt; I have faith in my death. If I have faith in my death, I have faith in my resurrection. &gt;&gt; He said, "In the age that we now live and to bring forth children of this age, we are not Lutheran. &gt;&gt; We are not Wesley's. &gt;&gt; Neither are we Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this age. through the pregnancy of the word of God to bring forth a child of this &gt;&gt; age. I I wanted to lay down the age, you understand? So you don't get confused. It's not Christianity. This is different. &gt;&gt; This is a different crop, &gt;&gt; a different seed. &gt;&gt; We've died to the old man. &gt;&gt; We've died to that other nature. Now, our father's seed is coming to maturity. one was matured in front of us that we know that we're that's where we're going. &gt;&gt; We fight off the bugs. We fight off the pestilence. We fight off the drought. And we keep growing. We keep growing. Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring forth a child of the age, the seed child, &gt;&gt; not our father, natural seed child, but the seed child, the other seed, the real us. We've died to the father, our natural father that taught us everything that we are. Gave us our personality, gave us our nature, gave us our food, gave us our clothes style, gave us our skin color, gave us our nose, gave us our eyes. We're dead to that. &gt;&gt; Now, there's a new seed. &gt;&gt; Our father's seed. It doesn't matter what the ground is. It's the seed that's important. Now that seed is coming to maturity. &gt;&gt; What sparks that life and brings it to life was the wave offering. &gt;&gt; That's what brought it to life. And every single one of us, those that were in Pentecost when his ministry came, they came out. They started coming out. We don't want to go back. &gt;&gt; Honest. You've got to have faith in your death. &gt;&gt; The seed child. Amen. I hope you understand. Couldn't be pregnant. No. So what did he do? He put her away in divorcement. That's right. But see, Dareth put him away. He put her away. He went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him same by himself. He did it by himself. How was he? What was he doing it by? you know Malachi 4:5 vindicating him saying by himself his children begin to kind of look more like him &gt;&gt; because it's fully maturing &gt;&gt; or they become children of the word not children of the church &gt;&gt; children of the word and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word, &gt;&gt; unadulterated, not touched by any man's organization, any man-made theory. She'll be pure, unadulterated, &gt;&gt; bride of the word. Amen. Amen. I hope you get that out on the air. She will be the pregnant daughter of God. What pregnant her? &gt;&gt; What pregnant this whole age? &gt;&gt; What pregnant the true church? It was that little man &gt;&gt; that stood there and said, "You're not a witch." &gt;&gt; That wasn't William Brandham. &gt;&gt; That was the bridegroom &gt;&gt; veiled in flesh. proposing and finding his bride. We can't go forward without it. There's no substitute for it. No tremendous style of preaching. Paul said, 'I didn't come to you with enticing words, but I came to you with the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I didn't come to you with entertainment. And it's not entertainment. It's becoming entertainment. And if we don't face up to it, we don't call it exactly what it is and we don't say, "Wait a minute. We're not against people. We're not against churches. Anybody can worship the way that they want. If they don't want to play tapes, that's their business. If they want the gifts operating within their church, that's their business. You understand? But I've got to know what I've died to. And I have to know what has resurrected me in this word. And it's not a secondhand revelation. I don't know about brother Brandham because somebody told me about brother Brandham &gt;&gt; or somebody told me what brother Brandham taught. or told me a story about brother Brandham. I know what brother Brandon taught because I listened to him. &gt;&gt; I heard testimonies of them from men that knew him that didn't know each other. I saw the effect of his life and his nature on men. And I saw the same effect of the people that sat in the presence of God and what it did to them and how that they were and the reverence they had to this message and the reverence they had to the absoluteness of this ministry. It it was phenomenal. And I see a great drift And you know, and so I I I I'm you know, we I guess we use that saying stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't want you to have hard feelings towards anybody. I'm not trying to keep you away from anything. You can go to any meeting you feel led to go to. You can You got the internet. I've never told you not to listen to no preachers. You've got to do you have you can do all that you want. But don't pursue entertainment. &gt;&gt; Don't forget really where the spark comes from. It doesn't come from music. It doesn't come from anointed preaching. It comes from the sheath offering. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if long as we can re keep those things, we can stay in balance, &gt;&gt; you know, and if you know, I mean I've learned to live with the reproach, you know, I the reason I play tapes because I can't preach and you know and he ain't the preacher he used to be. Well, to be honest with you, I don't want to be the preacher I used to be. I hope I've grown up &gt;&gt; a little bit. They refer to me as the ice cube preacher that I just want to pour water on the church. They say, "Oh, he doesn't allow the anointing in his church." Well, I do. &gt;&gt; When they said that, I said, "Amen. That's true. They don't allow the anointing because the anointing's on the tapes. But I want you to be aware that you personally have to have faith that you've come out of the world, that you've died, and that there's a seed in you that your original father. My father, Morton EMTT McGary, was not my original father. He was the method and means which God brought this body into the world. And he raised this body and taught this body to think and eat. But because my heavenly father had put another seed in me, &gt;&gt; that seed had to be germinated because it was the seed of God. And that could only be pregnant or brought to life by the word of God. I wasn't born in Luther's age. If I was, Luther would have brought me to justification. I wasn't born in Wesley's age. If I was, Wesley would have brought me to sanctification. I wasn't born in the restoration of the gifts. If I was, the gifts would have been restored. And there's a big movement to recit the gifts back in the church, which fine. If you, some of you feel you have gifts and you want to get together, we'll put a night a week and you can come here and pray till the spirit of God comes on you and give your prophecy. And if it doesn't come to pass, you'll stand up in front of the church and confess that you had an evil spirit. That'll make sure you know your gift's real. But we're not that. We're the children of this age. Brought to life by the messenger of this age, by the word of God for this age. That's what why we're taking the path. is not anti- anything. I if you go to a meeting, I want you to have a good time. I want you to worship. I want you to rejoice. If you feel like running and shouting, running and shout, have a hallelujah. But just know that's what it is. But this is your life. You say, "Why didn't you hold up the Bible?" The same thing &gt;&gt; just takes, you know, if you had Wesley here and you lined up the word with his message, you get sanctification. If you had Luther here, you get Luther. If you have the messenger for your age here, you'll become a child at this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what keeps your target. &gt;&gt; That's what keeps you straight. &gt;&gt; So, I just want you to understand that and and see it that there's another seed in us. And that seed of our fathers dead and we're risen again in Christ Jesus, made new creatures by the word of God. So if the old guy is bugging you, kill him. &gt;&gt; Tell him, "Wait a minute. I'm dead to you. &gt;&gt; You are a ghost. You are from the past. I'm not letting you in. I'm not opening the door for you. I have no part of you. I'm going to turn back to my father." If you've been prodal, go back to your father. But if you don't return to you can return to your first father and he'll take care of you. Which of you having a child that would ask a loaf of bread and would give him a serpent? &gt;&gt; But you better find your heavenly father &gt;&gt; because everybody that's of their earthly father dies. &gt;&gt; Everybody that's at their heavenly father lives forever. So God bless you this morning. Think on these things. Meditate on these things. Don't be down on yourself. But look up and ask yourself, I believe. Let the life of Jesus Christ come into your heart. And let us become more like him. As we m mature, we become more like the sheath offering, more like the first fruit, more like the sun. Sen has been shining on us and we become more and more of a Christian. So, let's stand together. Musicians, come. It's a little late. It's 12:30. Um, again, this evening, you know what we're going to do. We hope you come out and enjoy it with us. We're looking and seeing the nature, the mannerism, and the first fruit and and and I believe tonight is our communion service. So, uh we'll we'll just it takes about an hour to play the film and then we'll have communion. So, is everybody good with that tonight? Okay. I hope you enjoy it. Did any do you enjoy Wednesday night? Those of you that were here, wasn't it nice? A man told us, he said, "You know, I never heard seen that and heard Brother Brandham with my own ears before." He said, "You played that just for me." He said, he sat there and wept the whole service. Cuz he finally learned English and he could hear it for himself and watch it and know that that was life and life amnet. If you don't know the Lord Jesus and you want to know the Lord Jesus, it's very simple. Just ask. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall receive. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's such a thing as life, eternal life, I'd like to experience it. If you know the way you're living's not right and you'd like that way to pass from you, you repent. Tell God you're sorry. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of those sins, the washing away of your past, and you'll be resurrected by the spirit of God in your life. You believe that? &gt;&gt; I can you put those words up for me? Uh you you thank him for the cross. You thank him for his death &gt;&gt; that you could die. Hallelujah. Are you glad you got eternal life? You should be know you should know you're full of eternal life. Oh, I I I've got faith that I've dead and I've risen with him. I'm so happy. Help me sing it.

But we're grateful, Lord, that we can come here and be in your presence, Lord, and have that word, the word that you anointed to mold us and shape us into the image that you'd have, Lord, that we could die to our ideas and our thoughts and in our ambitions, Lord God, and yield ourselves unto this word, Lord. So many different interpretations and ideas, Lord. Lord, even in our midst, Lord, but we're united under one word, Lord. It's your way, Lord. We're so grateful, Lord, that you've your mercy, how it rewrote our lives, Lord. Lord, we're all going a different way, but we're taught there's only two ways, and we just want your way, Lord. We ask that you'd have your way. We thank you, Lord, for the word that we heard. &gt;&gt; We ask that you continue to lead us and guide us in your word, Lord.
