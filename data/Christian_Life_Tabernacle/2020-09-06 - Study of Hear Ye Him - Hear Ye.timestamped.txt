[13:01] name of the lord jesus christ amen
[13:07] amen welcome everyone in the house of
[13:10] god this morning our visitors
[13:11] will welcome you this morning as you're
[13:13] invited by mike foster so i'm reading
[13:18] amen
[13:21] good morning so as uh
[13:24] you know if you read the psalms you'll
[13:26] notice that there's a certain
[13:28] section of the psalms from 121 to
[13:31] 133 134 each one describes itself as the
[13:35] psalm of degrees
[13:38] and in jewish tradition
[13:41] each of these psalms were something that
[13:43] they recited that became their testimony
[13:45] on their journey
[13:46] to jerusalem as they got each step
[13:49] closer they would recite the next one of
[13:52] these
[13:52] verses as a witness as a testimony
[13:56] of who they were and as to prepare
[13:57] themselves for that returning to that
[14:00] place
[14:01] of worship one of those is psalm 126.
[14:06] you know what's interesting about psalm
[14:08] 126 is that
[14:10] you know if you do any those of you that
[14:12] are bible readers
[14:15] you know you'll know that there's a time
[14:16] in israel's history where
[14:19] they went through a period of captivity
[14:22] where
[14:23] they began to all the old landmarks
[14:26] broke down and they began to fight one
[14:27] another and they became a divided nation
[14:29] and then
[14:30] ultimately one by one they were
[14:32] conquered and taken over to some land of
[14:34] captivity
[14:35] israel went to assyria judah went to
[14:37] babylon
[14:38] and so it's a great event in their
[14:40] history the captivity
[14:43] but it's interesting when you read in
[14:45] psalm 126 when david says in verse 1
[14:47] when the lord
[14:48] turned again the captivity of zion we
[14:51] were like them with a dream this was
[14:53] hundreds of years before the captivity
[14:55] so here you have david speaking
[14:59] about the joy that comes from being
[15:01] delivered from captivity
[15:04] hundreds of years before any captivity
[15:06] happened to the children of israel
[15:08] you know and he also describes this
[15:10] people of of zion and he numbers himself
[15:13] with these people he says when the lord
[15:16] turned again the captivity of zion we
[15:19] were like them in a dream and in verse 4
[15:22] when it says turn again
[15:23] our captivity oh lord so here you have
[15:27] him speaking about a captivity
[15:29] that hadn't happened yet and of a people
[15:32] that weren't necessarily the people that
[15:33] he was a part of at that time
[15:35] because israel was not going through
[15:36] captivity so what is this
[15:39] you know here you have david rejoicing
[15:42] and sin
[15:42] and laughing and joy about the freedom
[15:45] from captivity and this prayer to be
[15:47] delivered from captivity again
[15:49] what is this he's talking about well you
[15:52] know paul says it i think
[15:54] another way if you look at romans
[15:57] chapter 7
[15:58] he describes a similar condition of
[16:01] captivity and deliverance
[16:03] and it says i find then a law in verse
[16:05] 21
[16:07] when i would do good evil is present
[16:10] with me
[16:11] for i delight in the law of god after
[16:13] the inward man
[16:15] but i see another law in my members
[16:18] warring against the law
[16:19] of my mind and bringing me into
[16:21] captivity
[16:23] to the law of sin which is in my members
[16:25] so here you have both david and paul
[16:28] talking about a captivity that they seek
[16:32] deliverance from
[16:34] you know it's interesting he describes
[16:36] zion we looked at this a couple weeks
[16:37] ago
[16:38] zion is described in the scriptures of
[16:40] many things but among them is it's a
[16:42] people with whom god is pleased to dwell
[16:45] and so here you've got both david and
[16:47] paul numbering themselves among those
[16:48] people and the people with
[16:50] whom god is pleased to dwell are the
[16:51] people that long for and rejoice at the
[16:54] deliverance from their captivity
[16:57] paul goes on to say in verse 24 o
[16:59] wretched man that i am who shall deliver
[17:01] me
[17:02] from the body of this death i thank god
[17:05] through jesus christ our lord
[17:08] you know and in fact it's paul later
[17:10] says in ephesians 4
[17:12] which you know you can go and look this
[17:13] up in fact in verse 1 he describes
[17:15] himself as a captive again a captive to
[17:17] jesus
[17:18] christ but in verse 8 he says wherefore
[17:21] he saith
[17:22] when he ascended up on high he led
[17:25] captivity
[17:27] captive so the very captivity that these
[17:31] men
[17:31] longed for deliverance from was itself
[17:34] taken captive by a work that was done
[17:37] this is that people
[17:39] that he speaks about those people that
[17:40] people that are talking about that
[17:42] transformational experience
[17:44] when their captivity is led captive
[17:47] and interesting when paul says that he's
[17:49] quoting david because david actually
[17:51] said that in psalms 68 18
[17:53] he said thou hast ascended on high thou
[17:56] hast led captivity captive thou has
[17:59] received
[18:00] gifts for men so when you look at psalm
[18:03] 126
[18:05] i i pray that we're not looking at that
[18:08] with the historical lens of these are
[18:10] jews talking about a captivity release
[18:12] that happened hundreds of years ago but
[18:13] this is a man
[18:15] who numbered himself among the people of
[18:17] zion
[18:18] who was celebrating the moment when his
[18:20] captivity
[18:22] was led captive this is our testimony
[18:25] this is the testimony of a people of
[18:27] zion who are speaking of a
[18:28] transformational experience
[18:30] do you remember the effect of having
[18:31] your captivity led captive
[18:33] did it feel like you were in a dream
[18:36] that you could not believe that this
[18:37] captivity
[18:39] was over i like some of the things he
[18:40] says here he says in verse 2
[18:43] he says then said they among the heathen
[18:45] and this is psalm 126 the lord hath done
[18:47] great things for them
[18:48] how many of you were surrounded by
[18:50] worldly people that there came a moment
[18:51] in your life like something's changed
[18:53] with this person
[18:54] and here's paul celeb or it's david
[18:56] celebrating the same thing
[18:58] and then in psalm six he goes on to say
[18:59] he that our psalm verse six he says he
[19:01] that goeth forth
[19:02] and weeping bearing precious seed you
[19:05] remember that time maybe at an altar
[19:07] somewhere
[19:09] where you were weeping and that seed was
[19:10] awakened
[19:12] right you went forth with weeping
[19:13] bearing that precious seed and at the
[19:15] end of verse 6
[19:16] shall doubtless come again with
[19:18] rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him
[19:21] so when you leave an altar and weeping
[19:23] bearing that precious seed
[19:24] there comes a day when you come forth
[19:26] rejoicing with that fruit
[19:28] from that seed as we read psalm 126 this
[19:31] morning just a short psalm that's our
[19:32] testimony
[19:33] that's the testimony of the
[19:34] transformational experience
[19:36] of a people of zion that who's with whom
[19:39] captivity has been
[19:40] set captive so let's read that together
[19:43] if we can
[19:43] psalm 126 it says this when the lord
[19:47] turned again the captivity of zion we
[19:50] were like them
[19:51] that dream then was our mouth filled
[19:54] with laughter
[19:55] and our tongue with singing then said
[19:57] they among the heathen
[19:59] the lord hath done great things for them
[20:02] the lord hath done great things for us
[20:04] whereof we are glad turn again our
[20:07] captivity o lord
[20:09] as the streams in the south they that
[20:12] sow in tears
[20:13] shall reap enjoy he that goeth forth and
[20:16] weepeth
[20:17] beareth precious seed shall doubtless
[20:19] come again
[20:20] with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with
[20:23] him r
[20:28] amen god bless you may have your seats
[20:31] [Music]
[20:32] amen
[20:34] let's sing kfc man let's sing when i see
[20:37] the blood i'll pass over you
[20:39] amen

[44:34] and everything but all the time he was
[44:37] out there he was the king

[51:45] or just go through some scriptures and
[51:48] and uh read
[51:51] some statements to you and try to
[51:56] present a picture of
[51:59] the path that
[52:03] the lord is taking his church down
[52:07] and i hope it is inspiring to you so if
[52:10] you have your bibles let's go ahead and
[52:12] stand
[52:13] and turn to the
[52:18] 17th chapter of matthew
[52:22] and we'll read in the fourth and um
[52:26] fifth verse of the
[52:31] 17th chapter of
[52:35] matthew and we know that
[52:39] the setting of this story
[52:42] well and uh
[52:47] and it it this is where
[52:51] and we'll just start and read at the
[52:54] at the um
[52:57] start the first verse and after six days
[53:01] this is matthew the 17th chapter
[53:04] and after six days jesus
[53:08] taketh peter james and john his brother
[53:11] and bring them up into a high
[53:15] mountain apart and was transfigured
[53:19] before them
[53:20] and his face did shine as the sun
[53:23] and his reignant was white
[53:26] as the light and behold there appeared
[53:30] unto them moses and elijah
[53:34] talking with him then answered peter and
[53:37] said unto jesus
[53:39] lord it is good for us to be here
[53:43] if that will let us make
[53:46] here three tabernacles one for the
[53:50] one for moses and one for elias
[53:54] but while he yet spoke behold
[53:58] a bright cloud overshadowed them
[54:01] and behold a voice out of the cloud
[54:05] which said this is my beloved son
[54:10] in whom i am well pleased
[54:13] hear ye him amen god bless you you may
[54:18] be
[54:18] seated this morning we're just going to
[54:22] take a little moment this morning to
[54:25] read some
[54:26] statements and talk to you a little bit
[54:30] about what's on our heart
[54:34] and i we know this story and
[54:39] brother i'm in talking about this he
[54:42] makes a statement that really
[54:45] stuck with me i'm going to be reading
[54:48] out of the message here ye
[54:49] him preached and spoke spokane
[54:51] washington
[54:52] 7 11 and 62 but he said
[54:56] peter had experienced
[55:00] this great supernatural
[55:05] uh event and
[55:08] immediately uh he got excited
[55:13] and uh that's common for people to get
[55:16] excited
[55:17] when the supernaturals there
[55:21] but we also see another pattern that's
[55:24] very
[55:25] common and that is that
[55:29] all of a sudden peter started to come up
[55:32] with a program amen let us build this
[55:37] and let us build that and let's do this
[55:41] and our messenger said i'm so
[55:44] glad that god cut him off
[55:49] could you imagine the path and the
[55:51] direction
[55:53] the church would have been on
[55:56] or the path that it
[56:00] would have taken but the cloud
[56:03] come about and overshadow and spoke
[56:06] this words this is my beloved son
[56:10] in whom i'm well pleased this is where i
[56:13] dwell and hear ye
[56:16] him and that's the text
[56:20] that uh was used was hear ye
[56:23] him and i thought that is a a
[56:27] a really good practice
[56:32] is to hear the lord to hear
[56:36] uh from the lord and especially
[56:39] in this time that we're living in
[56:44] uh i i've we know that
[56:47] uh with all the confusion
[56:51] that's going on and all the
[56:54] economic news and the news of
[56:58] the mass plague that's upon the earth
[57:01] and
[57:02] and all the excitement and
[57:06] viewpoints and and the different
[57:09] interpretations
[57:10] and different ways to live and and it's
[57:13] just
[57:13] such a a a time
[57:17] of uncertainty
[57:20] that people begin to look for answers
[57:25] uh they're they're they're they're
[57:28] almost
[57:28] forced into making decisions
[57:32] their hands are are being forced
[57:36] what should i do what where should i go
[57:41] should i look for a different job should
[57:44] i
[57:44] wait it out to keep this job should i
[57:48] should i send my kids to school should i
[57:51] not
[57:51] send my split to cool should i uh go
[57:54] see my parents or not see my parents and
[57:58] it breaks my heart when i i read
[58:02] stories of
[58:06] tragedies where somebody becomes ill or
[58:10] becomes sick and
[58:12] and their loved ones can't go see them
[58:14] because of
[58:15] a a policy you know
[58:18] but yet they will they will put gowns on
[58:22] the nurses and gowns on the doctors and
[58:25] and none of them can do any good but at
[58:28] least a loved one could bring comfort
[58:31] to do something so i am i'm a i i get
[58:34] upset
[58:35] at some of those things it breaks my
[58:39] heart
[58:39] i i sit back and i think of myself if i
[58:42] wouldn't be able to go see
[58:44] my mother or what that would that would
[58:47] hurt me
[58:48] so and all these
[58:51] these pressures that are
[58:54] are coming on now you might not
[58:57] you you might not feel sometimes like
[59:00] you're under pressure
[59:02] but we tell the the story of a frog
[59:06] you place in the boiling water
[59:10] and the water just gets warmer and
[59:12] warmer and warmer and the frog just
[59:15] adapts adapts and
[59:17] dabs and after a while he doesn't even
[59:19] know to jump
[59:20] out of it because the the very
[59:23] pressure working on him in
[59:26] in the fashion that it worked on it
[59:30] begins
[59:30] to affect your thinking
[59:37] when you look around and and you're
[59:40] trying to reach out
[59:41] to find data you're trying to reach out
[59:45] to find
[59:46] answers you're trying to look out to
[59:48] find
[59:49] circumstances until you start listening
[59:52] and listening and the more you listen to
[59:55] different things that you hear
[59:57] and all those things begin to have an
[1:00:00] effect
[1:00:01] on us and they begin to uh
[1:00:05] they begin to uh uh press in
[1:00:08] on us and we're using we're
[1:00:11] using what that we hear what that we
[1:00:15] read
[1:00:16] what that we see what the the buzz is
[1:00:20] going around we start to grab to those
[1:00:23] things and gravitate to those things
[1:00:25] and we use those things as information
[1:00:30] we use those things as decision tools
[1:00:34] we look at what other people
[1:00:38] are doing and we take their
[1:00:41] example and so it does
[1:00:44] it creates uh it creates a real
[1:00:48] uh a pressure
[1:00:52] on us and it's that pressure that
[1:00:55] causes people to do things pressure will
[1:00:58] cause people to do things
[1:01:00] that they normally wouldn't do it
[1:01:03] causes us to make rash decisions
[1:01:07] and and not wait it out
[1:01:10] and and and think it out but
[1:01:14] uh that's why that this is such a
[1:01:17] an important statement hear ye
[1:01:22] him hearing
[1:01:25] him that what a situation these
[1:01:30] men were ready to move they were
[1:01:33] ready to make a choice they were ready
[1:01:36] to make a decision they were ready to
[1:01:38] start
[1:01:38] something do something whatever it was
[1:01:42] they said it's good to be here they're
[1:01:45] excited and they get
[1:01:46] they get in that place and they just
[1:01:48] feel i've got to respond to this
[1:01:52] i've got to react there's something that
[1:01:55] i've got to do there's something that
[1:01:56] i've got to participate
[1:01:59] and the cloud of glory came down and
[1:02:02] shined about him and spoke to him he
[1:02:05] said this
[1:02:06] is my beloved son hear ye
[1:02:09] him now
[1:02:13] isn't that really the best person
[1:02:17] to hear when you
[1:02:20] think about it that this is the creator
[1:02:24] of heaven and earth this is alpha
[1:02:27] and omega the beginning
[1:02:31] and the end everything that was made
[1:02:34] was made by him nothing that was made
[1:02:38] there was nothing made that
[1:02:40] that he was not the maker of
[1:02:43] he knows the beginning from the end
[1:02:48] he he knows what's coming he knows
[1:02:52] what's transpiring and not only does he
[1:02:55] know these things but he's made
[1:02:57] provisions for his own
[1:03:02] when abraham and
[1:03:07] his family were in israel
[1:03:12] and there was a great famine coming god
[1:03:15] knew that
[1:03:18] he everything was absolutely uh
[1:03:21] god had his hand in it and so he
[1:03:25] he went out and he he he took joseph and
[1:03:29] had him thrown in a well and had him
[1:03:31] taken off to egypt
[1:03:33] had him thrown in prison they had him to
[1:03:36] interpret a dream had him come to
[1:03:39] pharaoh
[1:03:40] everything you have to say was
[1:03:42] orchestrated
[1:03:43] so god could save his people
[1:03:47] because he knew that through those
[1:03:49] people would come
[1:03:50] our savior amen it's hard to sit back
[1:03:54] and think that the whole thing that went
[1:03:56] on in egypt
[1:03:58] the whole transport uh uh
[1:04:01] leaving their land and going into egypt
[1:04:05] and then being brought into slavery and
[1:04:07] the great deliverance that worked
[1:04:10] all that was done for me
[1:04:15] it was you say you're awful
[1:04:19] uh that seems awful
[1:04:22] bold but nevertheless god had to bring
[1:04:26] us to this day
[1:04:28] he had to have you sitting here because
[1:04:31] he had your
[1:04:32] names written on the lamb's book of life
[1:04:34] he
[1:04:35] he knew you and he knew he had to have
[1:04:38] you and he knew you had to be manifested
[1:04:40] and he made provisions all down through
[1:04:43] time
[1:04:44] to come through the prophets and the
[1:04:47] apostles and through sunday time and
[1:04:51] diverse manners he spoke to his servants
[1:04:55] by the holy spirit and they prophesied
[1:04:57] and they wrote
[1:04:59] and he prophesied of the promises that
[1:05:01] would be here
[1:05:02] and the day that would be be here he did
[1:05:06] all that for his children
[1:05:10] because he knew what the end was going
[1:05:12] to be
[1:05:15] he knew what it was he was going to
[1:05:17] accomplish
[1:05:18] and he made provisions all the way down
[1:05:22] and and so he instructed those
[1:05:26] apostles peter james and john there
[1:05:29] and he said now hear ye him
[1:05:35] you know we ought to all have a place
[1:05:38] and a time set aside to hear from god
[1:05:45] we really should and we should know
[1:05:49] that he's a god that wants to speak to
[1:05:51] us
[1:05:53] and really talk to us and
[1:05:57] he wants to be our god he is our god
[1:06:01] and so we just like duke it brought me
[1:06:05] to this sermon and act
[1:06:08] and to me it's just such a beautiful
[1:06:13] uh sermon as we read some
[1:06:18] statements from it to you and i know i'm
[1:06:21] not
[1:06:21] a very good reader and i ask you to bear
[1:06:24] with me you know i'm not
[1:06:26] intelligent by any means but
[1:06:30] god's still a god of grace amen
[1:06:34] so let's look as he says now peter
[1:06:36] called it
[1:06:37] the holy mountain because the holy god
[1:06:41] had been
[1:06:42] on this mountain and before god
[1:06:46] does anything usually on earth
[1:06:50] he usually speaks it out of heaven
[1:06:54] first so before god does anything on
[1:06:57] earth he usually speaks it out
[1:07:00] so we know that as being the word of god
[1:07:04] so if god is the head of our lives if
[1:07:08] he's the head of the body
[1:07:10] if he's the shepherd then before he
[1:07:13] usually does
[1:07:14] anything on earth even in your life
[1:07:19] he has spoken it out in his word
[1:07:24] that's why it's so important to us to
[1:07:28] find that place in the word of god
[1:07:31] to read our bibles to pray to hear
[1:07:35] ye him he said now
[1:07:41] did you ever notice that he always
[1:07:43] speaks from heaven first
[1:07:46] the supernatural always manifests itself
[1:07:50] and then comes down and
[1:07:53] to the people if you notice before
[1:07:56] israel was called out of
[1:07:57] egypt now moses tried to do that
[1:08:02] believing that he was the person
[1:08:06] that was given the message
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:13] i say this if i could say this
[1:08:17] to myself maybe in in a way
[1:08:22] we know that we're a people we've been
[1:08:25] talking about this
[1:08:27] that war of people that are chosen
[1:08:31] in this day it called and elected
[1:08:35] we've heard the message and we know that
[1:08:38] we're
[1:08:39] a people that are to be restored
[1:08:44] that the faith that our fathers had
[1:08:50] that wrote the book of acts is supposed
[1:08:53] to be returned
[1:08:55] to us and
[1:08:58] and that that is a marvelous promise
[1:09:03] but we have to understand that there
[1:09:06] there's the thing
[1:09:07] that always gets in the way
[1:09:12] is our intellect
[1:09:15] and i hope by just reading this that you
[1:09:18] can
[1:09:19] uh see this he said he he
[1:09:22] knew that he was that he was the person
[1:09:25] that was given the message but he had
[1:09:29] tried to do it by his own will
[1:09:33] and by an intellectual
[1:09:36] standpoint he said
[1:09:40] but before the time was right
[1:09:44] now that's what intellect always does
[1:09:49] intellect always messes up the timing
[1:09:55] you can see it's right you can
[1:09:59] see what it says it and you
[1:10:02] have uh the intellectual
[1:10:06] understanding of it and moses had that
[1:10:11] and that's what he did he tried to do it
[1:10:14] from
[1:10:14] an intellectual standpoint but before
[1:10:18] the time was right now that's why it's
[1:10:22] so important when we say
[1:10:23] hear ye him
[1:10:26] because he's the holder of
[1:10:30] the time he's the holder
[1:10:33] of the time and a sheep doesn't produce
[1:10:38] it doesn't manufacture wool it bears
[1:10:42] wool in its time you can't go out to a
[1:10:46] flock of sheep and say now sheep
[1:10:49] hurry up and grow some wool i have an
[1:10:52] order here and you could try to feed
[1:10:55] them what you want to feed them you can
[1:10:57] try to
[1:10:58] do whatever you can but there's a time
[1:11:01] and a season that that bears its fruit
[1:11:07] and when it's out of that time and it's
[1:11:10] out of the season
[1:11:12] it'll never produce the fruit that god
[1:11:15] intends it to produce we could go into a
[1:11:19] long discussion of latter rain
[1:11:22] and former rain but i believe that god's
[1:11:25] got a time
[1:11:26] for everything and he has a way
[1:11:29] of doing uh things
[1:11:32] and i think that's what we want to be
[1:11:34] interested in
[1:11:36] young people you've got job decisions to
[1:11:39] make
[1:11:39] you've got you've got relation decisions
[1:11:43] to make
[1:11:44] okay we have financial decisions to make
[1:11:48] and sometimes we don't give them the
[1:11:51] regard
[1:11:52] that we should uh give them
[1:11:55] but they're deported decisions in our
[1:11:58] life
[1:11:58] every single decision that we make
[1:12:02] bears a consequence good or bad
[1:12:07] it has an effect many times we think
[1:12:10] our decisions only have effect on
[1:12:13] ourselves but they
[1:12:15] have an effect on our friends they have
[1:12:17] an effect on our
[1:12:19] our children they have an effect on our
[1:12:22] parents
[1:12:23] they they have an effect a broad effect
[1:12:27] because we are interconnected people
[1:12:31] we are a family and even a decision
[1:12:34] within a body of believers
[1:12:36] can have effect on that body
[1:12:40] it can cause a lot of
[1:12:45] wondering or doubts or or
[1:12:48] or decisions and and
[1:12:52] and sometimes we make decisions and
[1:12:56] and we have to weigh those decisions and
[1:12:58] we watch those decisions
[1:13:00] and that's why one of the zeals for the
[1:13:03] age
[1:13:03] is to say i was wrong
[1:13:06] i made a decision and i thought it was
[1:13:09] the right thing to do and we tried it
[1:13:11] out but it didn't work out
[1:13:13] and then i got to come back and and
[1:13:17] and so there's there's a great value
[1:13:20] in uh in our decision making
[1:13:23] to understand that there is a right time
[1:13:30] and you know even in the many times the
[1:13:33] uh we were taught when when
[1:13:36] brother brown would have a vision and he
[1:13:39] would go
[1:13:40] there and he would have to wait till the
[1:13:43] portions of that vision fell in their
[1:13:46] place
[1:13:48] because it was the right time and so let
[1:13:51] me
[1:13:51] say it this way intellect
[1:13:55] many times gets us
[1:13:58] out of the timing of god
[1:14:02] and that's what we want to do we want to
[1:14:03] be in step
[1:14:05] with the father we want to be in step
[1:14:08] with the movement of the holy spirit
[1:14:10] we know that the footsteps of the
[1:14:12] righteous are ordered by the lord
[1:14:15] so many times we know the step
[1:14:20] but it's hard to wait on the wind it's
[1:14:23] hard to hear the
[1:14:24] voice as now now now's the time to
[1:14:28] move now's the time to go now that
[1:14:31] unction of the spirit leads you you sit
[1:14:34] there and you contain
[1:14:35] all of it within your mind and you can
[1:14:38] see it you can study it
[1:14:40] you can read the quotes about it but
[1:14:43] that
[1:14:43] still doesn't make it the right time
[1:14:49] there's only one that holds the time
[1:14:53] in his hands and that's god himself
[1:14:58] that's why many times it's the test of
[1:15:00] time
[1:15:01] it's time tested memorials you're
[1:15:04] believing god for your healing and years
[1:15:06] go on
[1:15:07] trials go on you do everything you can
[1:15:10] in satan battles and battles and battles
[1:15:13] just remember one thing god has got the
[1:15:16] time
[1:15:17] in his hands
[1:15:21] he's the only one that can say time is
[1:15:24] no more
[1:15:26] okay and that's just such a a wonderful
[1:15:30] place
[1:15:32] but he said now he said but when the
[1:15:34] time got right
[1:15:38] now hear ye him
[1:15:41] when the time got right
[1:15:45] so you know it intellectually okay
[1:15:48] you know it's there you you've got it
[1:15:51] down in your mind you can see it
[1:15:54] it's all there but you can't act on that
[1:15:57] intellect
[1:16:01] it's hard to wait on the lord
[1:16:04] but those who wait on the lord will
[1:16:07] renew their strength
[1:16:09] they will rise up and fly
[1:16:12] they'll become eagles and they'll move
[1:16:14] past
[1:16:15] into the heights he said but when the
[1:16:17] time got right
[1:16:19] there was a visitor came down from
[1:16:21] heaven
[1:16:22] and it was god himself
[1:16:26] amen when the time gets right you will
[1:16:29] have a
[1:16:30] visitor from heaven in your life
[1:16:34] and that's why it's important to hear ye
[1:16:37] him you will have the visitors because
[1:16:40] we know that the word of god teaches us
[1:16:43] every time that there's a problem every
[1:16:45] time there's a trial
[1:16:47] every time there's a sickness every time
[1:16:49] there's a need of deliverance
[1:16:51] god within his own attributes has the
[1:16:54] characteristic
[1:16:56] that causes him to go by that need
[1:17:02] said i have need to go by there
[1:17:06] he had need to go to the woman at the
[1:17:08] well
[1:17:09] he sat there waiting for her he had need
[1:17:13] to be there
[1:17:14] because the time had got right
[1:17:17] and okay and and that's what you you
[1:17:19] know you when you
[1:17:20] sit before the lord and you lay
[1:17:23] something
[1:17:24] out before him just know that he says
[1:17:27] when the time
[1:17:28] comes right there's a visitor that comes
[1:17:31] down
[1:17:32] from heaven how many believes he'll do
[1:17:36] that for you too
[1:17:38] sure he will
[1:17:41] everybody's trying to force our hand
[1:17:44] everybody's trying to
[1:17:45] force a decision every time but if we
[1:17:48] can be still
[1:17:50] and know that he's god and we can sit
[1:17:53] there and we can hold this
[1:17:55] one thing in our heart the footsteps of
[1:17:58] the righteous are ordered by the lord
[1:18:01] he is mindful of us he cares for us
[1:18:05] he promised us he wouldn't leave us nor
[1:18:08] forsake us
[1:18:09] it's just we have such a battle so many
[1:18:11] times
[1:18:12] with the our intellect because our our
[1:18:15] intellect sees
[1:18:16] things it understands things
[1:18:19] but it's so important for us to bring
[1:18:22] our lives
[1:18:23] both naturally and spiritually
[1:18:26] into the timing of god god's got a time
[1:18:29] for your life
[1:18:33] he's never left you he's never forsaken
[1:18:37] you
[1:18:38] he he will he will be there for you
[1:18:42] he never failed he came to the burning
[1:18:45] bush and he spoke to moses
[1:18:47] before he sent him out i believe that
[1:18:50] every man before he goes out
[1:18:54] on the field to preach the gospel
[1:18:57] ought to first have an experience with
[1:19:00] god
[1:19:00] before he goes because in this
[1:19:04] intellectual day as the bible tells us
[1:19:09] will come this day that they'll be heady
[1:19:15] you know in other words they use their
[1:19:19] their brain
[1:19:27] they'll be they'll be heady
[1:19:31] high-minded lovers of pleasure
[1:19:35] more than lovers of god having
[1:19:38] a form of godliness
[1:19:42] but denying the power thereof
[1:19:46] okay and and this is what we're
[1:19:49] interested
[1:19:50] in we're interested that the power
[1:19:53] of the gospel comes back into our midst
[1:19:58] that we're not having the this message
[1:20:01] can be you can teach
[1:20:04] this message mentally
[1:20:08] and have mental stimulation
[1:20:12] wow i never seen that
[1:20:17] wow i've never put it together like that
[1:20:21] wow wow
[1:20:24] you know and what it doesn't uh
[1:20:28] it doesn't do us any good
[1:20:32] if it doesn't produce a power
[1:20:36] that goes with it the kingdom of god is
[1:20:39] preached in
[1:20:40] power and demonstration of the spirit
[1:20:45] and i'm afraid that uh
[1:20:48] we've relied on the intellect
[1:20:51] to try to produce that power
[1:20:56] and it's never produced that way
[1:21:00] the power is only produced
[1:21:03] by the visitation of one
[1:21:06] coming down from heaven and speaking to
[1:21:10] the heart of the person
[1:21:13] power is given by
[1:21:17] god himself
[1:21:22] now we just want to go just a little bit
[1:21:26] this morning in this
[1:21:30] lesson he said
[1:21:38] and they've got intellectual giants in
[1:21:41] the world
[1:21:42] today that can almost explain away
[1:21:45] everything that god said to be true
[1:21:49] or they take it from a theological
[1:21:51] standpoint
[1:21:52] intellectually and if you just
[1:21:56] take your own mind of thinking and
[1:21:58] reasoning like
[1:21:59] he did in the beginning they can explain
[1:22:03] everything of the bible away
[1:22:06] from you now i just feel to inject this
[1:22:15] intellectually i believe
[1:22:18] one of the things that's been taught to
[1:22:21] the church
[1:22:24] that has been so detrimental
[1:22:27] was that after we've tried everything
[1:22:30] else
[1:22:34] after we've tried you know the the
[1:22:37] special
[1:22:38] herb uh plant from the deep in the
[1:22:41] bottom of the ocean
[1:22:43] that that produces the secret grant
[1:22:46] green algae that if you take it four
[1:22:49] times a day for the next three months
[1:22:53] you'll get well
[1:22:56] or whatever miracle pill miracle oil
[1:23:00] miracle plan miracle diet
[1:23:06] after you go see the specialist that
[1:23:09] sends you to the specialist
[1:23:11] that happens to have another specialist
[1:23:13] everybody's in on the pie
[1:23:15] everybody's getting the cut everybody's
[1:23:18] turning you
[1:23:19] into merchandise why has it happened to
[1:23:22] the church
[1:23:23] that god's become our last resort
[1:23:31] why why does it got to the point
[1:23:36] that it's after we tried everything else
[1:23:40] and everything else fails
[1:23:43] then we miserably
[1:23:46] with no faith crawl to god
[1:23:50] and start begging
[1:23:55] i do not believe that was the
[1:23:58] vision that the lord had for his church
[1:24:05] and that was not the faith
[1:24:08] that was going to be restored in this
[1:24:14] age
[1:24:17] this is the faith that we want
[1:24:22] purple green algae i have none
[1:24:28] a specialist or a referral to you
[1:24:32] i have none
[1:24:35] a psychologist
[1:24:38] or an exercise program i have
[1:24:42] none can you imagine peter had that day
[1:24:45] saying oh i know a therapist
[1:24:52] why don't you go down to 3434
[1:24:56] dungeon street and there's some guy down
[1:24:59] there
[1:25:00] that i know that'll put you on the rack
[1:25:03] and he'll stretch you and bend you and
[1:25:06] twist you and maybe if you just keep at
[1:25:09] it for a few years
[1:25:12] you'll get better
[1:25:18] i want to say intellectually
[1:25:22] this is right out of the word of god
[1:25:26] intellectually we've let great
[1:25:29] spiritual minds
[1:25:32] because they want control
[1:25:36] the nickelodeon spirit wants to control
[1:25:39] the power
[1:25:40] in the church they want it to come
[1:25:42] through the pulpit
[1:25:43] they're the ones that want to lay on
[1:25:45] hands they're the ones who want to
[1:25:47] determine who gets healed
[1:25:48] they're the ones that wants to make the
[1:25:50] discernment whether it's of god or not
[1:25:57] it's not what he said
[1:26:01] and what does he say that dude they'll
[1:26:02] explain it all away
[1:26:04] but he said silver and gold have we none
[1:26:09] but that which we have
[1:26:14] by that which i have
[1:26:19] by that which i possess i
[1:26:22] say unto you rise up
[1:26:27] and walk
[1:26:32] we're never going to see the
[1:26:34] supernatural
[1:26:38] as long as that's our approach
[1:26:43] when he's not first on the list he's
[1:26:46] last on the list
[1:26:51] i'll guarantee you you'd get a lot more
[1:26:54] benefit out of the doctor
[1:26:57] if you prayed through if you've got the
[1:27:00] faith
[1:27:01] and the lord spoke to your heart and
[1:27:03] said go to this doctor he'll help you
[1:27:07] then you won't see that doctor you won't
[1:27:10] see that piece of paper
[1:27:11] on the wall you won't see that little
[1:27:14] weird thing he hangs around his neck
[1:27:16] or whatever he has on his head you won't
[1:27:20] see that
[1:27:20] you'll see christ standing in that man
[1:27:24] willing to perform a service on you that
[1:27:27] god has ordained him to do
[1:27:34] but why put god on the back end
[1:27:40] but that's what intellect does
[1:27:43] it explained the concept away from us
[1:27:48] is that miracles can happen first
[1:27:52] we got miracles happen last brother wait
[1:27:54] the last thing we look for
[1:27:59] you don't think we got to rise up
[1:28:03] i mean we're not we don't want a fake
[1:28:05] thing do we
[1:28:06] we want the real gospel
[1:28:12] he said
[1:28:15] he says and they can explain everything
[1:28:17] of the bible
[1:28:18] away from you ask
[1:28:23] and you shall receive but if a man or a
[1:28:26] woman has ever been
[1:28:28] on the back side of the desert in those
[1:28:31] sacred
[1:28:31] sands where no intellectual
[1:28:35] can stand and there comes
[1:28:38] in contact with the living god
[1:28:42] no devil or scientist or
[1:28:45] anything else can ever explain that away
[1:28:50] you were there
[1:28:57] that's the key
[1:29:01] you were there not mama not daddy we
[1:29:04] know that we've heard that over and over
[1:29:06] again
[1:29:07] but that doesn't mean anything until you
[1:29:10] look at yourself
[1:29:14] and you say have i had a backside of the
[1:29:18] desert experience
[1:29:20] have i heard him
[1:29:24] hear ye him that's the instruction
[1:29:27] of the father from heaven in any
[1:29:31] decision that's
[1:29:32] ever made the first thing god wants you
[1:29:36] to do
[1:29:36] is hear the word
[1:29:43] that's the launching point
[1:29:46] of every decision you'll ever make
[1:29:50] and i know i've told you this before but
[1:29:53] you know
[1:29:53] success and failure is launched
[1:29:57] from the exact same spot
[1:30:03] everybody comes to that spot
[1:30:07] where either failure or success
[1:30:10] lies in front that is a time
[1:30:14] that you need to hear him
[1:30:18] when you're facing things that's when
[1:30:20] you want to hear him
[1:30:22] and that's the instruction from the
[1:30:26] father
[1:30:27] to all his children because i just heard
[1:30:30] you all testify
[1:30:32] i am a child of god oh were you lying
[1:30:37] liars
[1:30:40] no i believe you
[1:30:44] somebody looked at me and they thought
[1:30:46] prince's bride i don't know why
[1:30:48] but that's okay
[1:30:52] no you're not
[1:30:56] you are we went over that
[1:31:00] a week or so ago the evidence of
[1:31:02] election
[1:31:04] but what he's trying to bring us to and
[1:31:08] he's
[1:31:08] trying to get us to understand that
[1:31:10] there's this the part of our
[1:31:12] intellect that we have to move to is
[1:31:14] we've got to
[1:31:15] hear what that he's telling us and he
[1:31:17] says hear ye him
[1:31:19] so know that he says you've been there
[1:31:23] it happened you know it's the truth
[1:31:28] there no one can take it away from you
[1:31:31] you've meant
[1:31:32] god and a believer
[1:31:35] that god in every age sent forth
[1:31:39] a messenger always first meets that
[1:31:42] person
[1:31:43] on sacred ground because it's got
[1:31:46] to be so
[1:31:52] okay we're talking about the restoration
[1:31:56] of this power
[1:31:59] we're talking about this church being
[1:32:02] restored what was
[1:32:05] the event that caused this church to be
[1:32:09] birthed
[1:32:10] is they were in that upper room and they
[1:32:13] came
[1:32:14] on that sacred ground and they meant
[1:32:17] that pillar of fire
[1:32:18] they meant that experience
[1:32:28] you meant god and i believe that in
[1:32:31] every age god sends someone
[1:32:32] forth the message always first meets
[1:32:34] that person
[1:32:36] on the sacred ground because it's got to
[1:32:39] be so
[1:32:40] and now remember if god ever deals with
[1:32:43] one man one way he's got to deal with
[1:32:45] every man every way if he men a
[1:32:48] messenger on sacred ground
[1:32:50] he's got to meet every son and daughter
[1:32:52] on sacred ground
[1:32:54] you are entitled
[1:32:57] to that sacred ground
[1:33:02] it's a gift of god from you
[1:33:06] he welcomes you to that sacred ground he
[1:33:09] paid the price for you to come on that
[1:33:11] sacred ground
[1:33:13] he's he he's there for you
[1:33:16] knock and it shall be opened
[1:33:20] seek and you shall find come unto me
[1:33:23] all ye that are heavy laden and i'll
[1:33:26] give you
[1:33:27] rest that
[1:33:30] sacred ground is a place
[1:33:33] that he provided for
[1:33:36] you to come meet him
[1:33:42] to be endued with power from on high
[1:33:46] let's just read a little more because he
[1:33:49] said
[1:33:51] there's too much of evil
[1:33:56] there's too much of evil to try to
[1:33:59] explain
[1:34:00] all the supernatural away
[1:34:04] and where there's a supernatural god
[1:34:08] there's going to be supernatural things
[1:34:11] happening
[1:34:12] because he is super
[1:34:16] natural so where there's a supernatural
[1:34:20] god
[1:34:22] there'll be supernatural things
[1:34:24] happening
[1:34:25] so if that supernatural god is in our
[1:34:28] midst
[1:34:29] we ought to be an expectation of
[1:34:32] supernatural things happening
[1:34:35] we can't keep sitting back to an
[1:34:37] intellectual
[1:34:39] expression saying it's true it's true
[1:34:43] it's true
[1:34:44] someday if the seed is planted
[1:34:48] someday it better produce figs else it's
[1:34:51] going to be
[1:34:52] cut down and thrown into the fire
[1:34:58] so we're talking about the right time
[1:35:03] i believe it's the right time in our
[1:35:06] lives
[1:35:08] i don't care if you're backslid i don't
[1:35:11] care if you've had trouble in the flesh
[1:35:13] i
[1:35:14] i don't care if you've had mental
[1:35:16] problems
[1:35:17] financial problems and everything
[1:35:20] and all things seem to be pressing
[1:35:23] against you
[1:35:24] i believe it's time
[1:35:28] to get on sacred ground
[1:35:33] i think he's inviting us
[1:35:37] on an individual basis
[1:35:40] to come into that presence to come to
[1:35:43] that burning bush
[1:35:45] to come to that upper room experience to
[1:35:48] come to that closet
[1:35:50] and have that spirit come down and meet
[1:35:54] you
[1:35:57] and take leadership
[1:36:00] one of the last messages brother bran
[1:36:02] preached was leadership
[1:36:04] the importance of hearing
[1:36:07] ye him
[1:36:12] now god spoke first to moses before a
[1:36:15] supernatural thing
[1:36:17] taken place in his miracles
[1:36:23] what a beautiful thing to know
[1:36:28] you don't have to go out
[1:36:31] god speaks god
[1:36:34] visits god
[1:36:38] entertains god invites
[1:36:41] he invites you to talk it over
[1:36:45] come reason with me let's sit down and
[1:36:49] talk
[1:36:50] though your sins be a scarlet i'll make
[1:36:52] them white as snow
[1:36:54] cast your cares upon me cast your
[1:36:57] burdens upon me
[1:36:58] i care for you
[1:37:02] well i want to be i watch the kind of
[1:37:04] person i want my life
[1:37:07] i don't want to go face this all alone
[1:37:13] here god was standing there he was doing
[1:37:16] exactly
[1:37:17] what he asked them to do
[1:37:20] now in the father's great heritage
[1:37:24] where he had he had many hired men
[1:37:28] working for him
[1:37:29] now this is a little teaching here and i
[1:37:32] hope it don't hurt
[1:37:34] but i just want to make the point to get
[1:37:38] faith started right
[1:37:42] and i think that's important if we've
[1:37:44] had all this intellectual
[1:37:47] that's absolutely moved god to the
[1:37:49] bottom of the ladder
[1:37:51] and you know why he's there because
[1:37:53] we're afraid
[1:37:56] we're not sure who we are we're not sure
[1:37:59] what we're supposed to be doing
[1:38:03] it's kind of like have you ever
[1:38:07] started a new job that first couple of
[1:38:10] weeks on the new job you're tiptoeing
[1:38:12] around
[1:38:14] you don't really want to jump in and do
[1:38:16] too much you don't want to offend nobody
[1:38:19] yeah you know what i mean and and you
[1:38:22] just
[1:38:22] you know you're trying to get used to it
[1:38:24] you're trying to find the routine you're
[1:38:26] trying to
[1:38:27] understand how it works out so you can
[1:38:31] get
[1:38:31] involved that that's the way it it
[1:38:35] it seems some times you know but
[1:38:38] you want to get started outright
[1:38:42] and that's what we've got to do we've
[1:38:43] got to get back and start out right
[1:38:46] so when we get started we'll be on the
[1:38:49] right
[1:38:50] foot
[1:38:53] now why haven't we've had the things
[1:38:56] going on
[1:38:56] that should and i'm not saying we're not
[1:38:59] occasionally sprinkled
[1:39:01] with a miracle or a blessing
[1:39:05] i'm not saying that we don't get so
[1:39:07] desperate
[1:39:09] that people finally touch the hem of his
[1:39:12] garment
[1:39:14] but i really sincerely believe that god
[1:39:17] is
[1:39:17] wanting more from his church i i'm not
[1:39:20] let's take that word away wanting more
[1:39:23] he has more
[1:39:24] for his church
[1:39:28] amen he's got more that he wants to
[1:39:30] share
[1:39:31] more that he wants to give more of the
[1:39:34] kid he wants to
[1:39:35] participate
[1:39:38] he said and so if we start out we'll
[1:39:41] wrote us now he says notice
[1:39:43] when a baby's son was born into a family
[1:39:47] or to this father he was born
[1:39:51] a son
[1:39:54] so now what's he separating he's
[1:39:56] separating this man
[1:39:58] he's separating all his workers and
[1:40:01] all the people that are laboring from
[1:40:03] sons
[1:40:05] and daughters may i put it this way
[1:40:08] all the people that are laboring all the
[1:40:11] people that are worshiping
[1:40:13] separated from elected bride
[1:40:18] a separate group a separate blessing
[1:40:22] a separate gift
[1:40:27] he says he's born a son but yet he had
[1:40:31] no inheritance just as a son
[1:40:39] now there's where i think that we full
[1:40:42] gospel people let down a little bit
[1:40:44] on our doctrine see we take a person and
[1:40:47] say well
[1:40:48] now he's filled with the holy ghost he
[1:40:51] speaks with tongues
[1:40:53] that's it
[1:40:56] no you've only just begun
[1:41:00] you've just been born into the family
[1:41:03] that's all
[1:41:04] that's the reason today our churches is
[1:41:08] not
[1:41:08] progressing the way they should be
[1:41:14] and i i would think after 50 years in
[1:41:17] this message
[1:41:19] that let me
[1:41:22] take this personally i think after
[1:41:26] 50 years in the message
[1:41:29] i feel like i should have progressed
[1:41:33] farther than i have
[1:41:36] you place yourself in the equation
[1:41:40] is there a hunger in your heart for more
[1:41:43] if there's a hunger
[1:41:44] so if we if we know the hungers there
[1:41:48] and we know that we may have been going
[1:41:51] about it the right way
[1:41:52] the maybe the wrong way that maybe we
[1:41:55] didn't get started
[1:41:57] on the right foot
[1:42:00] then we can stop and hear him
[1:42:04] and get our course readjusted
[1:42:09] which might mean a few adjustments in
[1:42:11] our lives
[1:42:14] and the reason i'm reading this is i
[1:42:16] don't want you to feel this is personal
[1:42:18] from me
[1:42:20] i want you to understand this is the
[1:42:22] messenger drawing this picture
[1:42:25] i think that after this great revival
[1:42:28] that swept the world
[1:42:29] in these last few years i would
[1:42:33] think the saints of god ought to be
[1:42:36] in the heavenlies everywhere
[1:42:39] with the power of god going into
[1:42:42] hospitals
[1:42:43] and everywhere else and great signs
[1:42:46] and wonders and miracles taking place
[1:42:50] but he can't get the people to stand
[1:42:53] still
[1:42:54] long enough if you sow denominational
[1:42:58] seed you'll reap
[1:42:59] denominational harvest that's exactly
[1:43:03] that's what we've done if we've sowed
[1:43:06] intellectual
[1:43:07] seed we're going to reap an intellectual
[1:43:09] harvest
[1:43:10] we know the mysteries we know all these
[1:43:13] things and paul's telling the church
[1:43:15] though you know all the mysteries though
[1:43:17] you speak with the tongues and angels
[1:43:19] if you don't have the love of god in
[1:43:22] your heart
[1:43:23] you're nothing
[1:43:26] what did you say what does love have to
[1:43:28] do with power
[1:43:29] love is the motivation of every miracle
[1:43:33] that's ever been performed
[1:43:39] if you want to sign
[1:43:43] then you're missing this whole boat
[1:43:47] this is about the love of god being shed
[1:43:50] abroad
[1:43:51] in the hearts of his church
[1:43:56] i'll try to hurry
[1:44:00] but we that's exactly what we've done
[1:44:04] well well well what have we done
[1:44:08] we've added members got bigger churches
[1:44:13] bigger memberships but what we need is
[1:44:16] quality not quantity
[1:44:20] that's the trouble that's
[1:44:24] hunting of the bride today
[1:44:29] that's the hunting of the bride today
[1:44:34] we've got members
[1:44:39] and the bigger we get the more we think
[1:44:42] god's with us
[1:44:46] but we've got to be those members in
[1:44:49] particular
[1:44:55] that's the trouble that's the hunting of
[1:44:58] the bride today
[1:44:59] eliezer had an awful time
[1:45:02] finding quality
[1:45:05] and then to get her ready to go
[1:45:09] was the next thing after he found it
[1:45:13] so that's the next thing to do
[1:45:17] we're hunting for that now the holy
[1:45:20] spirit
[1:45:21] god's servant eliezer was
[1:45:24] hunting for that quality
[1:45:27] that genuineness that something that
[1:45:31] would take
[1:45:32] back on the word that won't take back on
[1:45:35] the word of god
[1:45:37] it'll stand there live or die and say
[1:45:40] it's truth
[1:45:41] god said so that settles it
[1:45:44] look at what he said he said the church
[1:45:46] went after members
[1:45:49] i don't care come on come to my place
[1:45:54] we don't care we if you if you
[1:45:58] come in then you're a believer
[1:46:02] we're glad to accept you it's just
[1:46:05] a general blanket and and
[1:46:08] and and we become happy with members
[1:46:13] and we think god god's not moving
[1:46:16] in members
[1:46:19] god's manifesting in members
[1:46:26] people that are performing his word
[1:46:28] keeping his word
[1:46:30] believing his word applying the token
[1:46:34] we don't see god move the way it should
[1:46:37] be moving because we've taken the token
[1:46:39] off of our homes
[1:46:42] we've taken the token off of what we
[1:46:44] read we take the token off of what we
[1:46:46] fellowship
[1:46:47] we take the token off we put the token
[1:46:50] we don't even have it on the door post
[1:46:52] we've washed the door post
[1:46:55] and we've invited in the music we've
[1:46:57] invited into tv we've invited in
[1:47:00] everything else and if you listen i'll
[1:47:04] read and
[1:47:05] and we wonder why we've got
[1:47:08] questions
[1:47:12] because god's a god of principle
[1:47:17] he can't cross his own word
[1:47:21] now we've been trying to get him across
[1:47:23] intellectually
[1:47:26] but he's he's looking for that he says
[1:47:28] that's the problem with the church
[1:47:30] he says getting her ready is another
[1:47:32] thing
[1:47:34] he says we find out what kind of person
[1:47:38] that's going to be
[1:47:39] before he has an inheritance now let me
[1:47:42] read that
[1:47:43] notice in the old testament now this boy
[1:47:46] when he was born into the family
[1:47:48] the first thing the father did after he
[1:47:51] got old enough to begin
[1:47:53] to be taught now his son
[1:47:57] when he's born certainly he's
[1:48:00] the he's the family name he's got it
[1:48:04] but he has no inheritance
[1:48:07] now we find out what kind of person
[1:48:11] that he's going to be before
[1:48:14] he has an inheritance now remember
[1:48:19] our inheritance is
[1:48:23] the power of god
[1:48:27] that's what our inheritance is our
[1:48:29] inheritance is the works that
[1:48:32] i do shall you do also
[1:48:35] now remember power apart from character
[1:48:39] is satanic so before the church
[1:48:43] receives the power it's got to be
[1:48:47] tutored by the holy spirit to see
[1:48:50] what kind of character this person has
[1:48:56] don't think it's strange if god starts
[1:48:58] dealing with your lives don't think it's
[1:49:00] strange if he starts cleaning up your
[1:49:02] lives
[1:49:03] don't think it's strange that he starts
[1:49:05] convicting you
[1:49:06] and teaching you and condemning you of
[1:49:09] the sin
[1:49:10] that's in your life he wants to clean
[1:49:13] us up because he's got an inheritance
[1:49:17] that he promised he would pass off
[1:49:25] let me just finish here and i i think
[1:49:28] you've got the point
[1:49:34] he says he gets a real trainer
[1:49:37] someone that'll be honest somebody
[1:49:39] that'll teach
[1:49:41] he said now i wonder today
[1:49:44] that when god has called his pentecostal
[1:49:47] church
[1:49:48] about 50 years ago and when he called
[1:49:51] the church
[1:49:52] at the beginning what kind of tutor
[1:49:56] did he put over the church
[1:49:59] he sent the holy ghost the holy spirit
[1:50:04] to be the tutor
[1:50:09] the holy spirit is
[1:50:12] the tutor hear ye
[1:50:15] him amen
[1:50:19] you've got to have a heart and ears
[1:50:22] for the holy spirit
[1:50:25] when the time right he speaks he
[1:50:29] comes he directs he leads
[1:50:32] he tithes we've got to understand the
[1:50:34] holy spirit
[1:50:36] we have not substituted it with
[1:50:39] intellectual
[1:50:40] teachings of ministers who spend all day
[1:50:43] long
[1:50:44] studying in the scriptures and putting
[1:50:46] quotes together and
[1:50:47] drawing these great pictures and these
[1:50:50] great
[1:50:51] the teachings and and everything and we
[1:50:53] sit there
[1:50:54] and we feed and feed
[1:50:59] we've got to have some personal contact
[1:51:01] here
[1:51:03] we've got to be filled with the holy
[1:51:05] ghost we've got to
[1:51:07] individually be led we've got to have
[1:51:10] the spirit of god moving in our heart
[1:51:12] we've got to be hunger for the spirit of
[1:51:14] god we have to understand
[1:51:16] that before we get our inheritance
[1:51:19] the holy spirit comes and tutors
[1:51:23] our lives
[1:51:27] it's not it's just what does it just say
[1:51:29] i've got the holy ghost
[1:51:31] if you don't ever hear them
[1:51:34] you don't listen to him
[1:51:38] you don't set sight time for him
[1:51:43] he says come unto me i'll give you rest
[1:51:46] i'll talk it over on fellowship
[1:51:48] so what we're talking about we're not
[1:51:50] talking about we're talking about the
[1:51:52] church of the living god
[1:51:54] that has promised to come into a
[1:51:56] fulfillment
[1:51:58] of placing a positioning a receiving of
[1:52:02] the things of god
[1:52:04] and but we've got to understand that in
[1:52:07] order to get there
[1:52:08] the holy spirit has got to tutor
[1:52:11] in our lives
[1:52:16] he's got to make attitude adjustments
[1:52:20] thought adjustments habit adjustments
[1:52:24] spiritual adjustments do you welcome
[1:52:27] the tutor do you
[1:52:30] welcome the spirit to come into your
[1:52:33] lives
[1:52:34] and teach you and lead you and guide you
[1:52:37] in all truth and righteousness i will
[1:52:39] not leave you comfortless
[1:52:41] but i will come again i'll be with you
[1:52:43] even
[1:52:44] in you and i'll lead you and guide you
[1:52:47] into
[1:52:47] all truth and righteousness
[1:52:52] we've moved the tudor out of the church
[1:53:00] you've got to get your personal tutor
[1:53:02] back
[1:53:05] what happens when a kid doesn't do very
[1:53:07] good in school
[1:53:09] you get him a tutor
[1:53:14] what happens when the church
[1:53:17] is falling behind where they should be
[1:53:22] what would i what would i ask for i'd
[1:53:25] say we need a tutor
[1:53:28] come holy spirit come start dealing with
[1:53:31] lives
[1:53:32] stump caught dealing with hearts we're
[1:53:34] all fitted and joined
[1:53:36] let's get our priorities back holy
[1:53:38] spirit move on each person's life
[1:53:40] that their priorities are back where i'd
[1:53:43] rather be in the house of god
[1:53:45] than than on the job i'd rather be
[1:53:48] fellowshipping than
[1:53:49] entertaining i'd rather i'd rather be
[1:53:51] about the things of god
[1:53:53] so let's follow this son for
[1:53:56] for a moment he says and today we've
[1:54:00] twisted it around
[1:54:04] with bishops and cardinals and popes
[1:54:07] and everything else with all kinds of
[1:54:10] ecclesiastical ideas and dogmas
[1:54:14] that's added and took away from the
[1:54:16] bible
[1:54:17] till the people don't know what to
[1:54:19] believe
[1:54:20] right they don't know which way
[1:54:24] to turn
[1:54:28] now
[1:54:32] i don't want to be in that condition he
[1:54:34] said we've twisted it around
[1:54:37] don't give up your personal leadership
[1:54:41] to a personality or to intellect
[1:54:45] no matter how wonderful the person is
[1:54:52] don't give it up to me don't give it up
[1:54:54] to any of the other wonderful ministers
[1:54:56] in this
[1:54:57] church don't give it up to a minister
[1:54:59] online
[1:55:01] if you've got to go online and find some
[1:55:03] certain guy that just tickles your
[1:55:05] little pinky
[1:55:10] you're in trouble
[1:55:14] because you won't know which way to turn
[1:55:18] and god forbid if that voice was ever
[1:55:21] cut off
[1:55:23] or he went astray
[1:55:27] then where would you be at
[1:55:31] you've got to be anchored you've got to
[1:55:33] know that god
[1:55:34] sent a voice and that voice said you
[1:55:37] hear
[1:55:38] ye him he says
[1:55:42] the poor bunch of people are like sheep
[1:55:46] having no shepherd a bunch of geese
[1:55:48] without a leader
[1:55:50] that's right they don't know which way
[1:55:52] way to fly
[1:55:54] everything's just gone every way this
[1:55:57] says this way
[1:55:59] this one this way and why they don't
[1:56:02] know what to believe god sent to his
[1:56:06] church the holy spirit
[1:56:08] that's the tudor and that tudor will
[1:56:11] tell the truth before god
[1:56:13] amen he feeds and teaches the children
[1:56:17] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:56:20] and the word was with god
[1:56:22] and the word was god god will judge the
[1:56:25] churches as i said a while ago
[1:56:27] by his word the bible said i felt
[1:56:31] that come to me the bible said here that
[1:56:34] god would judge his church by jesus
[1:56:36] christ that's right
[1:56:37] and jesus is the word so it's the word
[1:56:42] made manifest if christ
[1:56:46] still remains christ he takes that word
[1:56:49] and manifested amen there you are
[1:56:53] it's the word living amongst us
[1:56:57] coming to life
[1:57:02] that's what the tutor's for
[1:57:06] that's what the holy spirit's for is to
[1:57:09] get your life where he can come alive
[1:57:11] and come real and be manifested in you
[1:57:17] i just got a couple more statements and
[1:57:19] i'll just read them and i won't say
[1:57:21] now what do you think god would do today
[1:57:24] when the holy spirit comes
[1:57:26] and tells him that that in our churches
[1:57:30] that we accept dogma instead of his word
[1:57:34] what do you think we expect creeds and
[1:57:37] we accept creeds
[1:57:38] instead of christ what do you think he
[1:57:41] does
[1:57:42] when he comes up and says that his
[1:57:44] daughters
[1:57:45] has all bobbed their hair wearing shorts
[1:57:50] smoking cigarettes the bible says
[1:57:53] such can enter to misbelief
[1:57:57] you say it don't make any difference
[1:58:02] don't you let the devil tell you that
[1:58:06] if god said if paul said here in
[1:58:08] galatians 1
[1:58:09] 8 if an angel from heaven preached any
[1:58:13] other gospel than
[1:58:14] which i preached let him be accursed
[1:58:18] why did it make so much difference
[1:58:21] even little thing of lot's wife
[1:58:24] even turning and looking over his
[1:58:27] shoulder
[1:58:28] turned to a pillar of salt
[1:58:31] you've got to take the word there's
[1:58:35] a letdown somewhere
[1:58:38] you've got to get back to the gospel
[1:58:41] back to christ back to the living word
[1:58:45] no not bypass it
[1:58:49] for something this way you've got
[1:58:52] to believe it how can you
[1:58:57] how can you say that
[1:59:00] blanket natives who knew nothing about
[1:59:03] god
[1:59:04] received the holy ghost and realized
[1:59:07] they're naked
[1:59:09] and these american women strip every
[1:59:11] year
[1:59:12] and claim to be singing in choirs
[1:59:16] and christians support supposed
[1:59:20] to be there's something wrong somewhere
[1:59:23] and it ain't with god or his bible
[1:59:28] you know that's the truth no wonder we
[1:59:31] can't have revival
[1:59:33] no wonder we can't press into this
[1:59:36] no wonder that things can happen
[1:59:39] the tudor comes
[1:59:44] the tutor comes before the father and
[1:59:46] shakes his head
[1:59:48] oh my that's terrible the way they're
[1:59:50] doing
[1:59:51] well that's the truth what's the matter
[1:59:56] some little ticket meal ticket or
[1:59:58] something
[2:00:00] or a little something that somebody's
[2:00:02] afraid to say or something
[2:00:04] that's god's word preach it or leave it
[2:00:07] alone so that that's what
[2:00:10] that so i'm i'm listening
[2:00:14] to what the messenger is saying and i
[2:00:17] want to hear them
[2:00:19] you understand i want to hear ye him so
[2:00:23] he says there's there's something
[2:00:24] stopping the power
[2:00:26] there's something stopping god moving
[2:00:28] there's something stopping for those
[2:00:30] things
[2:00:31] so we look out and we say well we've got
[2:00:33] members
[2:00:34] we don't need members we need the
[2:00:36] members that we have
[2:00:38] to rise up in quality
[2:00:42] to set the wings of faith we can do
[2:00:46] more with 50 filled with the holy ghost
[2:00:49] than 200 half backslid people all the
[2:00:52] time
[2:00:56] i didn't say all the way backslid
[2:01:00] i said only half backslid
[2:01:07] you know to stir us up a little bit
[2:01:11] to get us to look in the mirror do i
[2:01:12] need to do i need to start putting that
[2:01:15] token to my life do i need to start
[2:01:16] doing these things
[2:01:18] what's wrong in other words we've got to
[2:01:22] move on but let's close with this
[2:01:28] but but what if the holy ghost comes
[2:01:31] before the father
[2:01:33] and says how could we ever build
[2:01:36] a church upon something like that
[2:01:40] listen friends it's time to clean
[2:01:44] from the top of the pulpit plum down
[2:01:47] to the janitor down there and start
[2:01:50] over it's just like a bunch of you take
[2:01:54] a bird
[2:01:56] lay their eggs in the springtime the old
[2:01:59] mother bird can lay
[2:02:02] a nest of eggs but she don't ha
[2:02:06] but she don't have to be with her mate
[2:02:12] but she can lay them eggs and she can
[2:02:15] hover over them
[2:02:17] and she can turn them and she can stay
[2:02:20] there
[2:02:21] till she starves herself till she gets
[2:02:24] so poor
[2:02:25] she can't get off the nest but they'll
[2:02:28] never
[2:02:29] hatch why they're rotten
[2:02:32] they're rot right in the nest
[2:02:36] why because they haven't been with
[2:02:39] the rooster
[2:02:45] and that's what's the matter today we've
[2:02:47] just
[2:02:48] took in so many members and so forth
[2:02:52] and babying them here and babying them
[2:02:55] there
[2:02:56] we just got a nest full of rotten eggs
[2:03:01] it's time to clean the whole thing out
[2:03:04] and to get them people with the mate
[2:03:08] jesus christ with the word of god
[2:03:11] back in action and power
[2:03:16] then we'll have a revival that'll shake
[2:03:19] something
[2:03:20] and do something then you'll see christ
[2:03:24] right in on the scene on the power
[2:03:27] he cannot come as long as these things
[2:03:31] are blocking him that's right
[2:03:34] no wonder the tudor come up before the
[2:03:37] father
[2:03:37] and blushed says your church i know
[2:03:41] it says that but they don't do it
[2:03:44] you mean they're not they're not doing
[2:03:47] it
[2:03:49] the holy spirit goes up to the father
[2:03:51] and says they're not doing it
[2:03:54] and he says what they're not doing it
[2:03:58] no but did you hear the statement
[2:04:01] what is it that's blocking him
[2:04:06] we've got to get in this together
[2:04:11] there you are what a disgrace
[2:04:14] what a pity that must be before the
[2:04:17] father
[2:04:18] when the tutor comes up the holy spirit
[2:04:20] and brings
[2:04:21] that case he is our
[2:04:24] tutor we know that
[2:04:28] and the holy spirit wrote the bible the
[2:04:31] bible said
[2:04:32] men of old moved by the holy ghost wrote
[2:04:34] the bible
[2:04:36] so the bible is written by inspiration
[2:04:39] there's no private interpretation it's
[2:04:41] just
[2:04:42] the way it's wrote that's right just
[2:04:45] take it
[2:04:46] believe it act on it god will bring it
[2:04:50] to pass
[2:04:51] i never seen him promise anything
[2:04:54] but what he done it he will do it
[2:04:58] as he always does he says
[2:05:01] here comes the tutor up
[2:05:04] and what if he comes up to the father
[2:05:08] oh how he feels myself
[2:05:11] come up and say your son is progressing
[2:05:16] he's a chip off the old block as we
[2:05:19] would say in the south
[2:05:21] he's just exactly like you
[2:05:24] he's just interested in all the sick and
[2:05:27] afflicted
[2:05:29] he's so interested in the salvation of
[2:05:32] people
[2:05:33] he's so interested in all of this
[2:05:36] he believes every word you said you know
[2:05:39] what
[2:05:40] he's running the church just exactly
[2:05:42] like you'd run it
[2:05:44] if you were there you know the way your
[2:05:47] son
[2:05:48] runs when you when he when he was there
[2:05:53] he said i asked a woman one time in the
[2:05:56] prayer line
[2:05:57] are you a christian she said i would
[2:05:59] have
[2:06:00] you understand i burn a candle every
[2:06:02] night
[2:06:04] like that had anything to do with
[2:06:05] christianity
[2:06:07] burning a candle every night i said
[2:06:10] that's no more than slopping hogs every
[2:06:14] night
[2:06:16] that wouldn't be a bit more to me i said
[2:06:18] are you born
[2:06:19] again you know christ is your savior
[2:06:23] he become and he become real
[2:06:28] really real to you are you living in
[2:06:31] christ
[2:06:32] is christ living in you that day you
[2:06:35] will know that i'm in the father
[2:06:37] and the father and me and i in you
[2:06:40] that's it god living among his people
[2:06:44] that's the way and then we find out
[2:06:47] we take if a son had been a good son
[2:06:52] just exactly now remember he was born a
[2:06:55] son
[2:06:56] don't miss that he was born a son
[2:06:59] but year after year he progressed
[2:07:03] and he's constantly about the father's
[2:07:05] business
[2:07:06] he's done the work just exactly the way
[2:07:08] the father did
[2:07:10] and the tutor says oh that's wonderful
[2:07:13] tell the father
[2:07:14] well it's just exactly the way you'd run
[2:07:17] it
[2:07:18] if you were there he balled out this
[2:07:22] and he condemned this and he give this a
[2:07:24] place he done just exactly the way you
[2:07:28] would do no different just exactly
[2:07:32] it's just like you there it's your life
[2:07:35] in him sure you can sure tell
[2:07:39] a son of god because he was
[2:07:42] born after you see it does the same
[2:07:45] thing
[2:07:46] that's right your word never miss a word
[2:07:51] oh the father says that's wonderful
[2:07:55] and there is coming a day if this sun
[2:07:58] continues on there is coming a day
[2:08:02] when they call it the placing of sons
[2:08:06] then the father called the group of
[2:08:07] people together in the city and took his
[2:08:09] own son and dressed him in a lovely robe
[2:08:12] and set him over every everybody could
[2:08:15] see
[2:08:16] had a ceremony and he adopted his son
[2:08:20] that had been born in his house and
[2:08:22] placed him
[2:08:23] and when he did that the son's name
[2:08:27] after that was just as good as the
[2:08:30] father's name
[2:08:32] and on the check or whatever he signed
[2:08:35] them
[2:08:35] days in them days it was a seal
[2:08:39] a ring because made them
[2:08:42] couldn't write it was put
[2:08:45] a penitentiary offense to copy that seal
[2:08:49] and they had it on the back of the ring
[2:08:52] and they would mash it
[2:08:53] like that and he could wear his father's
[2:08:56] ring
[2:08:57] why his name was just as good as the
[2:09:00] father's was
[2:09:02] now that's what god's trying to get
[2:09:05] his church to to
[2:09:08] a place that where we
[2:09:11] are sons and daughters of god
[2:09:15] we are trouble we're letting
[2:09:19] everything now the world's trying to
[2:09:22] smother the real thing down
[2:09:25] it's trying to make the people as scared
[2:09:30] that's what god's trying to get
[2:09:33] the church to for your word
[2:09:38] is as good as the father's word
[2:09:42] and it takes a tutor
[2:09:45] it takes a cleaning out
[2:09:49] it takes an involvement and it takes a
[2:09:53] desire in your heart
[2:09:56] but it's a wonderful message
[2:10:01] if you if we understand it let's hear
[2:10:04] them
[2:10:06] let's start hearing what the prophet of
[2:10:08] god said
[2:10:09] and i'll tell you
[2:10:13] if i know many of us have loved ones
[2:10:16] that we want to see
[2:10:17] god do great things for
[2:10:21] well maybe it needs to start in us
[2:10:26] maybe it needs to start in our lives now
[2:10:29] i could preach this morning
[2:10:31] some great mystery and
[2:10:35] i spent a lot of my life doing that
[2:10:40] but i'm looking for a church that
[2:10:42] possesses
[2:10:43] the power not condemning themselves
[2:10:48] because they don't have it
[2:10:52] but going to a tutor
[2:10:55] and let the holy spirit mold us and make
[2:10:58] us
[2:10:59] into the character that he can entrust
[2:11:02] that power we're sons and daughters of
[2:11:05] god
[2:11:07] we have an inheritance and this is our
[2:11:10] inheritance
[2:11:11] the works that i do you shall
[2:11:15] do also that is the inheritance of the
[2:11:19] father
[2:11:20] that is the inheritance of jesus christ
[2:11:23] to the church you're born but you've got
[2:11:26] to progress
[2:11:27] to that we've got to come to that
[2:11:31] and the only way that we can come to
[2:11:33] that
[2:11:34] is to submit ourselves to the tutor
[2:11:38] and start letting that tutor work on us
[2:11:41] work on our attitudes work on our words
[2:11:44] work on our
[2:11:45] atmosphere we've got to start letting
[2:11:48] the tutor
[2:11:49] tutor us into our inheritance
[2:11:54] and how many believe that's your
[2:11:56] inheritance
[2:11:58] it's your inheritance amen
[2:12:02] and i'm i'm thankful
[2:12:07] that if i see something that's not
[2:12:09] happening that i've got a place i can go
[2:12:11] to
[2:12:13] and say what can i do better what do i
[2:12:16] need to do
[2:12:17] what is it that i can do to have my life
[2:12:20] brought to a spot
[2:12:25] where the spirit of god what is it lord
[2:12:29] i'm in the prophet of god prayed for
[2:12:32] something
[2:12:33] and it it didn't happen and he he went
[2:12:36] to questioning god he went to wonder and
[2:12:38] he went to cert
[2:12:39] searching he wanted to hear from god
[2:12:43] he said i'm so burdened in my heart i'm
[2:12:45] going to move to the north i'm going to
[2:12:46] move to the south
[2:12:48] i'm going to move here i'm going to go
[2:12:49] where i've got it i've got to talk to
[2:12:51] him
[2:12:54] and and i'm going to say this again and
[2:12:57] i preached it last week
[2:12:59] there's a reason that we've got to come
[2:13:03] in contact
[2:13:04] with this power
[2:13:08] and with these signs and wonders that
[2:13:11] are going to follow us
[2:13:13] there's a reason that we've got to see
[2:13:15] the supernatural
[2:13:17] moving in our midst because there is a
[2:13:20] supernatural
[2:13:21] event coming called the rapture
[2:13:24] and if we can't live in this
[2:13:27] supernatural realm
[2:13:28] we're never going to see that
[2:13:30] supernatural move
[2:13:32] it's imperative that he would restore
[2:13:35] back
[2:13:36] to us the faith of our fathers because
[2:13:38] the faith that's restored back to us
[2:13:42] which is the manifestation of the word
[2:13:44] of god
[2:13:45] living in you is what prepares you
[2:13:48] for the rapture you will never
[2:13:51] have an intellectual rapture
[2:13:58] it is a physical event
[2:14:02] and the rapture is a condition it's not
[2:14:05] a calendar time and he said when this
[2:14:08] church gets ready
[2:14:10] he's going to take her i would like to
[2:14:13] invite
[2:14:13] this morning the tutor
[2:14:18] of the holy spirit not the power of the
[2:14:22] holy spirit
[2:14:24] not sit here and scream at the sky until
[2:14:27] we all shout and scream
[2:14:29] not scream at the sky it can tell we can
[2:14:32] produce
[2:14:33] some sort of emotional outcome
[2:14:37] i wouldn't like to invite the tutor
[2:14:41] into our lives to start teaching us
[2:14:45] and prepping us for the inheritance
[2:14:49] that god wants to give us and i hope you
[2:14:52] don't think i'm crazy
[2:14:56] but i look on your face as i can see the
[2:14:58] election in your lives
[2:15:01] i can see the love of god that you
[2:15:03] hacked and that's what he said my sons
[2:15:05] and my daughters
[2:15:06] they're interested in the sick and the
[2:15:08] afflicted they're
[2:15:09] interested in lost souls they're
[2:15:12] interested in deliverance
[2:15:14] and he said there's just been something
[2:15:16] that's taking it away from us
[2:15:19] and that's because we've listened to too
[2:15:22] many other voices
[2:15:23] instead of hearing him
[2:15:29] i encourage you to take time
[2:15:32] each day if you can and spend
[2:15:36] a little bit of time in that message of
[2:15:38] the hour
[2:15:39] listening to that voice
[2:15:44] reading your bible making contact
[2:15:48] because god does nothing on earth
[2:15:51] unless he comes down and speaks at first
[2:15:56] and therefore i say hear ye him do you
[2:15:59] want to hear him
[2:16:00] amen let the tutor come into your lives
[2:16:03] i'm not saying
[2:16:04] you don't have the holy ghost let them
[2:16:06] start teaching you
[2:16:07] let them start praising you let them
[2:16:09] start letting you progress
[2:16:11] does any i need progression i need to
[2:16:13] progress
[2:16:14] do you all want to progress god bless
[2:16:17] you let's stand
