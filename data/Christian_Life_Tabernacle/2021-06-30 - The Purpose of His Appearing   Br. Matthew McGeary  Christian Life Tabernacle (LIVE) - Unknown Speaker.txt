myself into some trouble i've thought i knew what i was doing and i thought i knew how something should be done and you come to find out you didn't have it figured out like you thought you did and then maybe you're praying for something and you're believing for something and you you think this should be the answer but the lord gots it all in control he rescues us from all of our disasters and all of our troubles and he's such a great gracious god that he even knew all your faults and failures and already atoned for him what a god rich in mercy i mean he rescued us from every thing the things we've already done and the things we would go to do let's just go before the lord heavenly father we're so thankful that we could be in your presence tonight just to be able to sing the songs of zion lord and as we sang the song that lord no matter how hard the trial no matter how big the waves no matter what we were facing lord you rescued us lord you're an ever-present help in the time of trouble lord living in such a dark hour as we would see out in the world amongst us lord we're so thankful we have a type like goshen that there is light loren there's light in the evening time and we're so thankful for your presence and for your word that is amongst us lord just pray that you'd pass by our way tonight that you would take the words lord and break the bread of life to your children we pray we love you we ask all these things in your name jesus christ amen praise the lord if you could turn in your bibles to acts chapter 26 amen praise the lord sure enjoy singing the songs getting the atmosphere set right and just kind of shaking off the heavy bands and i'm glad we have song service you know there's a big benefit in song service you can be blessed and be healed right there in the singing of the songs you can be blessed and healed by the preaching of the word it all plays a part in god's great economy amen it's reading out of acts chapter 26 we'll be reading verse 13 up to verse 19 maybe we'll start with verse 12. it says whereupon as i went we're just picking up here where uh uh i believe paul is testifying here to a king agrippa and he's telling about he's given his testimony and he says in verse 12 whereupon as i went to damascus with the authorities and commission from the chief priest at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining around about me and them which journeyed with me and when we were falling to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecute us but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from the darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by the faith that is in me amen we just pray a blessing upon the reading of the word you may be seated just want to pull for a a little thought here from verse 16 it says for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose and i want to just speak to you a little bit on the purpose of his appearing says to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which i will appear unto thee you know a minister and a witness is not for themselves only but there's another part to the equation he says i'm going to make the a minister and a witness and so it's not going to just be a minister and a witness for paul's sake but god is now apprehending paul because he has a work for him to do god is going to send paul unto the gentiles and he's going to bring them the faith and the word and i just even think of the scripture you know in in malachi says behold i send you elijah it doesn't say behold elijah but he says behold i send you elijah so the very purpose of elijah appearing on the scene was he had a specific work that god was wanting to use him for and so just last time we we spoke we we mentioned speaking about unlocking your potential and just looking at what potential is it's this it's it's potential means something that can develop or become actual we we want this word to become a living reality when paul was struck down on the road to the damascus what what he when he was persecuting the christian church there and now here he's struck down by the pillar of fire and he says paul it's hard to get kick against the pricks and he said who are you lord this very uh uh lord jesus that he was persecuting the church for who he he thought was an apostasy he thought he was a false christ he he his motive and his objective was to kill everybody that was professing the name of jesus christ because he believed that jesus was a false prophet that's what was in his thinking was but something transpired to paul where this very jesus that he did not believe in and the very people that were giving their lives they were willing to lay down their lives and say no i believe in jesus christ because there was a reality something had been quickened to them and now paul has come to this place to where he has met the lord jesus christ in the pillar of fire and so this jesus who they were calling the lord and savior and they were calling him the son of god this thing that seemed to be a a mystic or something that was false became a reality to him where he knew it for himself so that pillar of fire appeared for the purpose and what was that purpose he said i appeared unto you for this purpose because i'm going to make you a minister and a witness but we want this word now to become a living reality and as i was thinking about there's a lot of people that profess the word but the word is not a reality in their lives i was i was even thinking about that story in in uh where the two ladies are laying claim to one child and they end up before solomon one was an imposter one was faking it one was having a false claim but then in god's wisdom and in his mind he allowed a situation or an hour or something to present itself to where when solomon said all right if if y'all both are arguing over it then go ahead and cut the child in half but because there was a mother there that she wasn't faking it but it was a reality to her that was her child it brought something outside of her there was something in her that wasn't a put on there was something in her that wasn't fake she was a real true mother so when her baby come into harm's way something just hollered i said no don't don't hurt the baby it was something that other lady that was being being a make-believer she didn't possess something in her she was just faking it she was just making a false claim and that's exactly what we're starting to see in the hour that we're living in as things are tightening up and as things are getting more severe and that's the squeeze as you would say is coming on and it's just getting a little bit harder to live this message and people are starting to challenge people on what they believe they're starting to find out they don't have what they thought they had but that's okay for the true believer these things has to happen because if the word is a reality to you it's only an opportunity for that life that is then the seed to continue to grow and to continue to manifest and all of those attributes that god has placed on the seed inside of you all of the situations and everything that you're going through is just an opportunity for that word seed to be birthed into manifestation so we there has to come something that is going to pull that potential out as we think about the seeds you know you look at the flowers and you you look at the trees and you start to talk about the seed you start to talk about the seasons you know you might look at that flower and arrow it's basking in the glory of the sun and it's waving back and forth but there comes a season and a time and a fall and a winter where that glory and that beauty that you saw it goes into the ground but is that the end of the life of that seed is that the end of the life of that flower no because god has pus put his word into nature and there is a cycle there for that seed as it lays there in the earth all of us something something striking starts to happen in the deadness of winter and the cold and and the snow blankets the ground but oh as the earth turns and the seasons turn and that sun comes out and it starts to warm that earth something starts to happen laying under in that ground there's a seed with all of that potential to resurrect back to the fullness of the glory it had in the beginning oh and that's the purpose of the rising of the sun is to bring those seeds that have been sown into the earth into full manifestation of what they were intended to be if the sun never rose the seed could never serve its purpose you realize if we did not see the resurrection of the word in our day if we didn't see the rising of the sun if malachi 4 5 didn't come if luke 17 30 didn't appear and manifest the word then there would be no way for that word seed that was buried inside of you to come to manifestation but let me say it like this the purpose of his appearing was to sow that word into your heart and to be bringing into manifestation without the word we would have nothing to manifest as our pastor said we'd be looking back there somewhere trying to pull up something from an age gone by and trying to resurrect something from another age and if we're not careful we see people trying to do that today trying to resurrect some some manifestation from an age gone by but we're right here where god wants us to be living in the hour that he's called us to be in and he has sent his quickening power to manifest that seed amen that's where we're at we're living right in the time of the manifestations of the sons of god thank you lord we spoke a little bit about unlocking your potential and that definition is if you you unlock your potential you're locking the secrets of someone you release them i was just thinking my down there in egypt you had a joshua and a caleb you had a prophet who failed and had ran back on the back side of the desert here were all these sons of god who had a big part to play in god's economy here was here was moses he was supposed to be the prophet of the hour he doesn't even know what he's doing he's he's back there on the back side of the day he's done run away from his responsibility he's like i tried to do it i tried to be a son of god i tried to live this message i tried with everything that was in me and i wasn't able to do it i heard i was raised from a baby saying that i was a deliverer saying that was an i was an overcomer that i could run through a troop and i could leap over a wall but when i tried to do it on my own ability i tried to not utterly fallacy that's the problem we keep trying to manifest the message with our intellect and our own ability and it'll never work and there was a joshua and a caleb there they were there buried in the mud pits of egypt but when it came time for the hour of manifestation what did god do he appeared unto his prophet in a burning bush the pillar of fire came on the scene why because it was time for him to manifest the word of promise and to take his children in an exodus no different from the hour we're living in that's exactly why he appeared in this hour was to take us in an exodus i say as long as you're down there in the muck and mine of sin you're not serving your purpose we could go in and all to all the avenues of the way you can live in sin and you might be surprised living in sin doesn't need you need to be out there in the world running around you can be living you can be living in sin staring at a brick wall you're living in sin when you were born if you never committed one sin you're living in sin you could be born death dumb and blind and you're living in sin but oh god rich in mercy where with that great love wearing if he loved us he predestinated you and he elected you and he called you not to live down there in the muck in the mire but god has personally appeared to you to bring you out of that condition oh my are we thankful for that maybe we'll just read a scripture first peter 2 9. it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light oh praise god thank you lord jesus for calling me out of the darkness that i should show forth praises of you who called me out of that darkness into this marvelous glorious light oh my i don't know about you i'm so happy about it if this message is getting stagnant and you've you've gotten bored with it and you're just you're just kind of towing along and you're trying to put the quotes and everything together i'm telling you something is wrong something is wrong you need to meet the lord jesus christ personally for yourself you need to get the easter seal that quickening power in your heart and in your life and to set you on fire oh it's like fire shut up in your bones when you meet the lord jesus christ you're never the same and i'm not talking about some meeting at a campground i'm not talking about some experience at the altar all of those things are good but when you meet the resurrected lord jesus christ on those sacred sands oh something changes old things pass away all things become new oh the whole world can line up and take their shot at you try to make you doubt it try to make you give it up all the devils in hell can come and try to torment you and show you that this message is wrong the whole church can walk away your pastor can walk away but there's an anchor that's driven so far down back to eternity you can't get away from this message if you wanted to you are the message you are the very manifestation of what was spoken by malachi 4 5. oh thank you jesus hallelujah john 14 90 says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye live also what is it because you have recognized because you have recognized the resurrection of the word of this day behold a little while the world is not going to see me anymore they're not going to see a jesus of nazareth walking around but you will see me because i live ye live also i'll be with you i'll be even in you until the end i say where is this lord jesus christ he's living in you oh i'm so glad about it to be quickened from the dead what does he say there in the rising of the sun he goes what a resurrection that was what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in jesus christ by that quickening power oh if you have an experience that i invite you to it'll take away all your doubts it'll take away all your fears all your unbelief and all your problems and everything that just seems so hard to get over oh and they just keep rolling in and you don't know how you're going to make it oh but when you have a friend that sticketh closer to a brother when you have the the creator of heavens and earth living on the inside of you oh it produces a peace that passes understanding oh praise god he would say in john 12 24 verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit if that same spirit that raised christ from the dead dwell in you what will it do it will quicken your mortal body it will bear the same fruit that our lord jesus christ bore it'll bear the same fruit that paul bore it'll bear the same fruit of our pentecostal fathers it'll bear the same fruit of the messenger of the hour why because it's christ the word living in you i wonder if we're hungering and thirsting for the manifestation of the message in your life i wonder if we've gotten complacent and we're just satisfied with the little bit of knowledge and understanding and maybe the little revelation that we think we have that we just got enough to make us happy we got just enough to get excited at the church meeting we got just enough to give us a little victory throughout the day but we're not hungry and thirsting for the deep things of god i think maybe a lot of us are just packaging packing around a little message baby bottle feeder we're we're just drinking message milk it's good don't get me wrong i i like it i like all the word of god but strong meat belongeth to those that are seasoned in the word i want some strong meat lord break the bread of life to me i want to feed on the deep things of god lord jesus i want to go all the way with you lord all that you have for me i want it i don't want to be satisfied and complacent with where i'm at but something is hungering and thirsting for more i want to take that next step and one more step and soon and very soon we're going to take that next step right into our theophany and be gone but you better be thirsting for it you better be hungering for it you better be looking for it you better be expecting it oh let's start expecting the word to be fruitful in our life then when the word then when the world asks you why you live the way you live why you do the things you do why you believe the way you believe because you've been quickened because something has taken place and typically the reason why they're inquiring with to you is because they know something's different about you and then we can say as jesus said when his mother and joseph come to him there in the temple say we've been looking all over for you where have you been the prophet says watch the word correct the air the prophet said she she even ruined her own testimony by showing up in the synagogue and saying to jesus your mother and father have been looking for you knowing that that was not joseph's son the prophet of god said that she she was ruining and speaking against her own testimony but he said watch the word correct the air he looked at her and said i must be about my father's business oh if there could be a people today that would be walking and breathing this message and walking in the sunlight of the s-o-n saying i must be about my father's business well i want to be about the father's business you know what the father's business is deliverance healing the salvation of your family a sanctified life a holy life a consecrated life possessing your vessels in sanctification and honor that's being about the father's business you know what the father's business is it's the holy ghost if you want to be about the father's business we want to get into a place where we're hungering and thirsting for the spirit of god to be moving in our life oh i i i say god help us i think sometimes we we got a little too good we need to be crying out for the spirit when jesus gave the parable there and he talks about the the seed being sown he said some uh fell on stony ground and it sprung up or some seed was sown and it sprung up but he said it lacked moisture you know a lot of the times the reason why you're not being fruitful in your christian life is because you lack moisture when's the last time maybe just ask this to yourself personally when's the last time at your own home you got into the presence of god now let's just be real all right let's just be real if we're going to be a book of acts church and if another limb has ever put forth and we're going to have uh uh i'll and the days of ananias and sapphira and we're going to be in such a unity where if sin tried to walk through them doors it would be called out i imagine there would be some some of us on a wednesday night telling our boss look you don't understand i got to get home i want to get into the presence of god just for a little bit let me get 15 minutes let me get five let me just get into the presence of god for 20 minutes five minutes lord before i show up to the church house because i want to do my part i want to get into the presence i need a little moisture i need a little spirit i want to bring something to the house of god oh but everybody's showing up with empty buckets that's okay because god gots enough to go around but i think we've come to a place where we're mature christians where we can show up with a little bit of something we got a little bit of something to throw onto the fire you see a little far i'm just going to throw a little bit on there you see somebody getting on fire starting to raise up and praise a little bit i've been praying for that brother i've been i've been wanting to see that brother get the victory and you're right there behind him you're rejoicing you're praising the lord we're getting in an atmosphere we're getting in the spirit we're getting a little moisture in our lives god help us to live a victorious life and live in the spirit the prophet of god would say and until you come in behind the badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and come into the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you oh god let that word become a living reality to me then you're awakened glory to god then you're awakened to the shekinah glory then the bible becomes a new book jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the show bread that's only provided provided that day for believers a priest a priest only and we are priests a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people given spiritual sacrifices to god but you must come in behind the veil to see the unveiled god oh god that's what i want until you come behind the badger skin until you're awakened into the shekinah glory do you know i i think a little bit like paul would say to the galatians there in galatians 3 1 he would say oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you you know you know the devil's trying to be with you he's trying to charm you he's trying to entertain you he's trying to offer you some substitutes oh foolish galatians who who has bewitched you from obeying the truth trying to keep you from serving your purpose but he he's so clever and crafty on how he can entertain us he might get you entertaining surfing other churches surfing other people's church services and and feeding on other church sites and stuff hey that's all right you do that all you want just don't be neglecting your responsibilities to your own group don't be neglecting your responsibilities to your family don't be neglecting your responsibility to your brothers and sisters here we have a responsibility and many times we can we we could be bewitched or we could be charmed that we get ourselves involved in things where we begun in the spirit oh things started out really good but he says oh foolish galatians who hath bewitched you he says are you so foolish having begun in the spirit that you are now made perfect in the flesh look the letter killeth it's the spirit that giveth life it saved will offer you position in the church he'll offer you a tradition he'll offer you a routine he'll offer you something to quench that hunger and that thirst for the spirit of god in your life he will give you responsibility that's good responsibility now let me taper that back and say god can give you that responsibility but if you're not careful you'll let that responsibility quench that hunger and that thirst for more of god in your life i can give a personal testimony that that i could say one thing when god called me to the ministry i said lord may i never let the work in the ministry and the calling to the ministry to quench that hunger and thirst for lost souls god never let me never be so uh uh uh to a place to where i don't have a heart and a longing to continue to witness and seek out those that are lost and preach the gospel out in the community and if we're not careful we'll let the church group and we let the church house and we let the church order and we allow the church routine to be that very thing that is quenching that fire of god in your life that's wanting to burst forth out in the community and win souls to god well it can happen that's a reality but we want that spirit of god moving in our life paul would say in romans 8 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god galatians 5 16 this i say then walk in the spirit and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh i like this little sometimes i call them one-liners brother branham said get in the spirit and when you get in the spirit then you see the vision then you're about the father's business i was i was really moved sunday when our pastor was speaking about you know the president's word and and saying that you're not missing out we're not missing out on anything i got to thinking about david here here here was david he's out there tending to his father's sheep and all of his brothers are down fighting a war and he's he's he's over there he's like you know what i've had an experience i've heard from the prophet he actually anointed me why am i out here just out here doing errands what am i doing anyways wha why why did god even call me why did god even anoint me why is this the position he has me in you know david probably felt like he was missing out saying all my brothers they're down there in action and all i'm doing is i'm just timing my father's sheep but you know he was out there while he was tending his father's sheep it was out there when he was going to school it was out there when he was in his home life it was out there that when he was just doing the things that seemed mundane it was out there when maybe he was just doing the dishes or doing the laundry or doing what your homemakers do it was when he was just doing the routine things that the spirit of god moved upon david and he slayed a lion and he slayed a bear so here david is he's feeling like maybe he's missing out a little bit and his father calls him and says hey david i want you to run on down and take some cheese and bread down down to your brothers and to the captain down there in the army so maybe david's feeling you know all right you know yes father i i'll do that and here he is i may be i don't know he's packing a little uh a a bread basket down the way and maybe there's some some other reinforcements coming in they're running in with with shields and spears and swords and they're looking at this guy like hey man where are you packing a bread basket to the battle like well i'm just about the father's business oh you're wearing us you're wearing a long skirt and unbroided hair and you're not putting all them fancy stuff in your hair to look like the world and and you're wearing it long and you ain't wearing those high-heeled shoes uh you're walking the king's highway yep i'm just about the father's business oh you look so humbly you don't you you don't blend in with the world you look old-fashioned you you look like little house on the prairie oh if you want to call me little house on the prayer if you want to tell me i'm old-fashioned whatever you want to call me just just call me about the father's business just call me being about the lord's business just call me be in the word being manifested i'm just doing what the father bit me do and here dave goes on down the road and he draws into the battle gets close there and there's all the israelites and he he he's going to uh uh make haste to do what his dad asked him to do and so he brings the bread and cheeses over and and he kind of gets a little uh uh uh a view of what's going on and he he hears about this champion making his boast and dave was like huh did i did i hear that right what what what did he say did i hear that right so so he said that if if anybody can beat him then they'll serve us and if if they beat us we'll serve them who is this guy to find the armies of the living god oh david was was willing to stand for what he believed but then his own brothers in in the church said who do you think you are come on you the only reason why you've come down here today is because you just wanted to be a little ornery and you just wanted to come spy on the battle you just wanted to get away from your regular uh uh routine and get away from your your regular duties and you just wanted to be a little mischievous and come on down here and just peek in on the battle and get a little entertainment but what they didn't realize david wasn't a bystander david wasn't a warmer matter of fact david was the main character in the story they didn't realize that he had been anointed by god but david was just going about his normal regular day he was just doing the dishes doing the laundry doing what his father paid him to do and it was in him doing the normal things that brought him into a place where god could use them in the big things and here he is there his brothers are telling them oh no you're just down here to to uh to spy on the battle and and you're you're not here to do anything he's like no no no if i heard it right this guy is defying the armies of the living god what will be done unto the man that will kill this guy oh he'll he'll give houses and lands and his father's land will be free in the house of israel and he'll even get the the the daughters you get the king's daughter david said sign me up not because the reward because he was not willing that someone would defy the word of god and i wonder if we've gotten so coward and so backboned and so scared of the socialist injustice this day that when people are pressuring you to pick a side people are pressuring you to take up the causes and the injustice and asking you how you feel you're too coward to let them know where you stand because you're afraid of these social injustices turning their guns on you oh i don't i don't want to really i don't really want to say that i'm a christian i don't really want to start uh testifying that god said he when he created uh he created a male and female or if i start to speak the word of god i'm gonna get these social injustice pointed it's gonna ruin my career it's gonna ruin my social standing at high school i'll never get the job i want oh don't worry life is about a vapor here he said if you're going to be ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you i don't need no job on this earth i don't need anything this world can offer all i want is what he's offered me and that's eternity nothing can take that away oh a tent or a cottage i don't care whatever it be on this side lord let me stand for you so then he says no so he gets to the king saul there and saul's like man david david you're just a young person you're just in the youth group come on man you're you're just you're just you're too young to get baptized you're too young to live a victorious life look david was just a young person packing a bag ice to the youth meetings david was just a young person that said hey i'll bring coke david was like just a young person say what can i do to help out david was just a young person going about his father's business and here he's testifying no no king saul no when i was out there at school the other day i actually witnessed to my friends and i stood up against all the stuff they were trying to push on me and i said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh you might not be slaying a physical line you know it might be slaying a physical bear but there is young people that god is raising up right now that are willing to stand for this message you might not be slaying a physical line or a physical deadline but you're slaying demons you're standing in the face of ladies and say my god it's real people probably standing around like david he says he killed a lion and a bear he says he's justified and sanctified and god's the holy ghost i highly doubt it but you know what i love about this story god gives us an opportunity to prove what we got don't be afraid of it welcome it yes if you've got god on the inside god's going to let you come into a trial or come into an hour that you can prove that god's on the inside and they started looking at dave like yeah this guy did you hear what he said he said he killed a line with his bare hands he said he killed killed a a a a a a bear in a lion just just just ripped them apart really this guy said that and here's the that's all the brothers and the people in the camp and here's his own king saying you know what david you're just a youth and this guy's been a man of war from his youth you think that wavered david david said nah the same god that was with me at school the same god that helped me keep an atmosphere in my home the same god that's kept me all this year he's the same god that's going to keep me in this trial he said i'll go and saul said all right well why don't why don't you try this why don't you try out my armor here why don't you uh uh put on this helmet and put on this uh uh a little vest here he started to put on all this armor and everything dave's like no uh i can't do it i haven't proved it i don't need this intellectual garbage i don't need this ecclesiastical outfit i'm just gonna go in the way that god called me and i'm gonna run out to the battle and all of the people that were doubting them were saying yeah i i i bet he i bet he never even i bet he never even killed a lion or killed a bear well they were they were about to find out whether he knew what he was talking about you say you got the holy ghost you say you were blessed in the meeting i want to say it this way you know what what david had at home he brought to the church meeting hey man and i'll say this maybe you feel like you didn't show up with anything that's okay get something and take it home but i promise you something if you say you got something you're gonna be tested to see if you got it or not we read in the easter seal where brother branham made that statement about believers confessing but we want to be believers in possession that was the difference about david david possessed his confession and we want to get to a place where the spirit of god is so moving in our lives that we're in possession of what we're confessing the prophet of god would say this he he said what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like eve tried to do see what happens if david would have stood there and said you know what that's true you're right saul i'm just a youth and it was a different terrain and everything and i was just being a shepherd out there watching after my sheep but you know what go ahead and give me all this army and i'll try to go out there david would have been trying to be a put on he'd have been trying to manifest something that he wasn't called to be he'd be trying to manufacture a warfare that god didn't call him to and the prophet of god is saying that right here he goes what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like eve tried to do she tried to have more light to manufacture something he says we've done the same thing trying to make something in ourselves keep your hand off of it let god do it take his word and believe it hold it in your heart and when the rain begins to fall life will take hold and the word will manifest itself you just keep doing what god's called you to do do it with all your heart you might not feel like you're you're in the limelight and you're doing all the big things and maybe you feel like you're like david you're just tending the sheep or you're you're just packing some food down the road a little bed basket while everybody's out there uh fighting in the army of god but you got to do your part you know something that struck struck me in my heart as i was thinking about this is that was david was commissioned by his father to take the bread and the cheese down to the battle but you know i say the person who actually made the bread and the cheese had a part in the story too from the time however the grain was harvested and ruled out to that mother that was in there and baking that bread and making that she had a part in cutting off goliath's head because that was part of the reason david was down there and many of us you have a part to play if it's if it's at home in your prayer closet or which it's making a phone call you got a great part in all of this don't let satan belittle your part in the economy of god every single part is the purpose of that seed that god has placed here that has to play out its part it has to serve its purpose and i want to encourage you that you're serving your purpose just move on a little bit here reading out of the easter seal he says now it is the spirit that quickens it's not the word that quickens it's the spirit that quickens the word or gives the word life gives it wings to fly gives it access it's the spirit that does that now the weed alone is just a wheat but when the quickening life gets into it listen to this now he's talking about you this ain't some fancy story for somebody else okay you're the wheat seed that god has planted in lady osea you were predestinated to be here for this hour for this time for this service and god has called you to get the quickening life quickening power into that wheat seed now the wheat alone is just wheat but when the quickening life gets into it into the wheat then it gives it life and we which were once dead made in the image of god and yet dead in sin and trespass there's some way god had to get this quickening life into your mortal bodies i'm talking about your body he's talking about your body all right you're the main character of this story tonight why don't we all just raise our hand everybody in here raise your hand oh man everybody's not participating you're the main character of this story right now all right god's talking to you god is wanting to get that quickening life into your mortal bodies he says now jesus was the word you believe that don't you in the beginning saint john 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and was made flesh and dwelt among us he goes on into uh paragraph 56 and he says that jesus was predestinated he was the predestinated word he was the word that was quickened for that hour so if jesus was the predestinated word and he was the word made manifest and he was the word quickened for that hour then what are you you also are the predestinated word that god has placed here at this time in this hour that you also would be the word that's quickened for this hour i'll just move a little bit further here brother branham strikes on predestination here referring to romans 8 30. he says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called on whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified i just want to grab a few quotes out of the spoken word as the original seed he says well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen never saw that before all right rewind let's let's read this again i mean the prophet says i never saw that before it makes me go what but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen never saw that before what what makes you believe the word of god and turn down these other things there is something in you well we might as well come unglued and run laps around the church there's something in you you can't even help it okay you keep wondering if you're gonna make it you keep wondering if you're the bride you keep wondering if you're elected you keep wondering if you're pre-that's why you're here there's something in you it's keeping you you're predestinated to it there is something in you way back yonder what you are made to live here forever oh i want a scripture for that preacher all right here it comes all that he foreknew glory he called all that he has called he has justified and all he has justified he is already glorified i was just thinking of the scripture he says all that he is already glorified it made me think of what what jesus says there i believe in john 17 5 it says lord glorify me with what the glory i had with you in the beginning if the brother branham would say that jesus was the only man that lived on the face of the earth that knew where he come from he said his mind wasn't darkened to that that he could stand there and say to the father lord glorify me with the glory i had you with you in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and what does the scripture say the same was in the beginning oh what did he what did he say he says let us make man in our image do you realize you were there with him oh and i love how he sees that jesus thought it not robbery he said let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus thinking and not robbery that he would be equal with god oh we're now living in the hour that the very intelligence of god the very unveiling of god has come down and he's telling you look i'm taking you right back to where you came from oh he's wanting us to catch that revelation oh i think we can say now oh god glorify me with the glory i had with you in the beginning that's why he has come in this hour as he's wanting to take us back to eden he wants to take us back to the beginning again oh that makes me happy that gets me excited has nothing to do with your works no matter how fast you run how high you jump how much you shout how many pews you can scale doesn't matter how good you can sing doesn't matter how many specials you do doesn't matter how good you can play the piano how bad you can play the piano doesn't matter that you you sound like a cricket when you try to sing songs you know what matters there's something in you uh if you if you can't get excited about that i don't know but when i get into some of my darkest hours when i get into some of the biggest trials when it when it gets when the when the going gets really tough and you want to talk about job the prophet got to a place where it was so tough that he had buried his wife and now he's holding his little baby girl there and the black sheep has come down and he's just about ready to give up because the devil's telling him he wasn't there for your dad he died your brother died your wife died now your baby girl's gonna die oh he said he couldn't tell me that god wasn't real i'd seen way too much but what he will do is he'll tell you that god don't love you you don't think he's trying the same thing tonight he keeps trying to tell you that nobody loves you that nobody's interested into you that you don't have any friends in the church that you're not important he's trying the same tactic to you to try to discourage and have you throw in the towel and some of you are sitting here this night and you're just wondering how much longer you're gonna hang in there but i want to tell you there's something in you it's holding you it's keeping you you can't fail you're predestinated not to fall and in that darkest hour when he was ready to throw up his hands oh that anchor caught though he slayed me yet i'll serve him oh we're talking about quickening power oh god let that life be quickened in me that in the face of all adversary in the face of all trial i can stand there and not waver and profess that you're the same yesterday today and forever might have loved ones that are sick you might have lost loved ones you might feel like god didn't answer your prayer oh praise god there's something in you you want to know what that something is you think david killed goliath it was the word anointed in david that killed he had been anointed to be king over israel the spirit of the lord was upon him you think you think goliath could have killed david no chance if goliath could have killed david he would have killed the word [Music] you think the devil can kill you you think he can put you down you think the devil can overcome you no for you the word he can't overcome you are more than an overcomer you're more than a conqueror in jesus christ oh hallelujah praise god praise god doesn't have anything to do with your works though we know james comes around and says all right well you say you got faith i'll show you my faith by my works david went there confessing right i got faith killed a lion killed a bear well guess what prove your faith by your works he did it a young a young boy a youth who was just packing a bag of ice to the youth meeting went on down there and cut off goliath's head he started a revival in the church that's what we need we need some young people we need some old people we need some people that say oh god restore unto me the joy of my salvation restore unto me that first love lord oh like that first meeting i had with you oh god where my wings were set i was soaring above the clouds i was soaring above all the all the troubles lord but the storms come lord it pressed me down into the valley i got i got little scales over my eyes i got some film that's filmed over my beak i feel like i can't even eat the word of god oh that the church house has gathered together the spirit of god is here to take off that film off your eyes to break the scale off your beak that you can feed on the body words ton of man oh hallelujah i'm so glad about it oh i might look a little crazy up here but i know what i'm talking about i've been in a valley once or twice i've been pushed way down by a storm i thought i'd never get down get out of there all the god rich and mercy by his holy ghost coming lifting me out of the valley oh if you ever been there you got something to talk about you got something to shout about you ain't afraid to testify a word he would say to them all people are trying to say they got it because of their works jesus would say many will say to me in that day lord have we not done many great mighty works with thy name he's going to say no well depart from me i never knew you you were not with me in the beginning they'll cast out more devils than you they'll have more church revivals than you they'll have more uh pantries open more more food banks you think you can compete with denominations yes get that out of your thinking i can take you to a few places their food banks are 10 times bigger in our church some of their food banks and their program help places with the real estate they're sitting on down over there i mean some of that stuff where most of our houses put together we're not here to compete with the denominationals we're not here to compete with the pentecostals we're not here to compete with anything we're here to defeat the devil many will come to me and say lord have we not done many great mighty things in your name you'll say depart from me you does of iniquity but it's those that were with him in the beginning those that were with him in his thoughts that are eternal just moving towards a close really quick the prophet would say all right well if it's all predestinated posing a question just maybe dramatizing a little bit coming off of this him talking about predestination i wonder if you've ever heard this before well then what's the use in preaching well you know if it's all predestinated and i really can't miss it then really doesn't matter what i do oh my listen to that devil oh my goodness he wants to talk you right out of your salvation and if you start listening to him you'll find yourself in a whole lot of trouble and because there's something in you you're going to be so miserable over there wearing the clothes of the world and going to their movie things in their theaters and following all their stuff and doing all that you're going to feel so defiled and so lost and so helpless one day that you're finally going to cry out because god is faithful to you and he said if you call in the name of the lord you shall be saved and he will rescue you but you can the prophet said you can save god a lot of trouble in yourself a lot of trouble if you just surrender to him i say god help us to surrender what's the use of preaching brother branham he said he said there is a crop out there only thing i'm doing is saying i'm just throwing it out there and see where it goes if they're are repellent the grease of the muck of the world and the denominations throw it off i can't help it but if there's one out there that can absorb it he'll turn to be a son and daughter of god just as sure as the world amen because it's predestinated he said i'm just fishing i'm just throwing out the line i'm just sowing the sowing the gospel net yeah you get a lot of fun you cashed out a net in the ocean you know people might be out there trying to catch crab or they're out there trying to catch tuna or something they do those huge staining nets and they pull them all in you think the only thing they got in the nets is just a bunch of well-cleaned ready fishes there's a bunch of seaweed seaweed and muck and critters in there and and i mean some some some some creatures that look you know pretty funny some ones that'll hurt you some that are pretty great but that's what the gospel net does that's what brother brandon would always say you have three types of believers make believers unbelievers and true believers in every a group of people just moving along he says that's the reason that god could work his works through jesus we're speaking a little bit about predestination we're moving towards a close quickly he said that's the reason god could work through jesus he was a predestinated son now i want to read this because i want you to recognize yourself in the word right jesus was our example he was the word made flesh we're bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh she is him so then what he did the bride does so then we need to identify ourselves in the word that was the purpose of the teaching right oh when our pastor started he said i've got about an hour an hour in me boys go along with it that's what brandon says we just want to be able to get there but brother branham and the spoken word is the original seed he says all these people saying oh i'll pour out my spirit upon all the flesh and all the manifestations of the latter rain he said they're saying all that he said it's nonsense he said you can't have the latter rain until you have the spring rain the teaching rain because it's the teaching rain that sows the seed he said in the end time side seed he says the denominational seed has been sown the pentecostal seed has been sown but the word seed has been sown but there has to come a harvest time there has to come a harvest rain or a rapturing faith oh my oh my now we start to get into the purposes of is appearing in the opening of those seals and that word that was broke open it was to bring this this church into manifestation because without that we don't have this oh glory to god oh that ought to make you shout right there hallelujah that's the reason god could work work his works through jesus he was the predestinated son he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world before a hundred billion trillion years ago that we said genesis 1 spoke of a while ago he was right then predestinated to take his place when was jesus christ predestinated take his place then when were you predestinated to take your place and you think and you and you're worried if you're ever going to take your place and you're worried if you're ever going to come to adoption and you're worried if you're ever going to fulfill your purpose you were predestinated to fulfill your purpose and lady odyssey before the world was ever created he was right then predestinated to take his place amen that's the reason the the will of the father he did he was the word made manifest and every one of the other sons will have the same manifestation and that's the ones that was predestinated before a hundred billion trillion years you were predestinated to take your place he says right here he says and here we are we come along and what happens i love this we believe it that's all brother matthew yep yep you come along and while the world has nothing in them to believe with there's not something in them like is in you you hear the most crazy outlandish word that you're eternal with god before the world was ever formed you were predestinated to take your place in this church house on a wednesday night in june yes yes and you come along here you are and you say amen i believe it he says that if you by faith will accept what the father all the prophets all the word of god he said i will pour this life down upon you and you can't do nothing else but produce the same thing that i am now i want to finish right here oh i love this here you are you come along the spoken word is the original seed you know you're a spoken word oh you were with the logos in the beginning the very eternal thoughts of god that were formed into the logos you were there and you were predestinated to take your place in ladies where were you job when i lay the foundations of the world oh when the sons of god shouted for joy you were there out of the samurai church age the prophet of god would say as the eternal logos of god was manifested in the sun he's speaking about jesus the eternal logos manifested in jesus christ being predestinated he says even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of god i want to read that portion as the musicians come he says even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed look abraham had his turn elijah had his turn david had his turn they were the very thoughts of god the very spoken words of god made flesh and their hour and their day they had their turn brother branham had his turn but i want to tell you it's our turn now it's your turn you are predestinated to be here in this hour to manifest the word of god oh it's your turn it's bride time it's eagle age it's rapture age it's harvest time it's going home time it's in a twinkling of a moment tonight you'll be change time let's all stand to our feet oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh praise god the prophet of god said maybe my faith won't climb where enoch climbed but he said i certainly wouldn't stop and get in anybody's way who thought they could climb there i say maybe we need to stop doubting one another and start believing in one another and say you know what brother you're believing to be healed if you can play something softly i'm going to believe with you i think a lot of times we're shrouded with doubt of one another [Music] i think we're just wondering and we're doubting and i wonder if they really are bordering i wonder if they really got an experience i wonder whether i wonder if they're sanctified i wonder if they're living in a holy ghost field i will quit wondering why don't you keep believing for them [Music] the problem you're doubting so much is because you're probably hung up with the same doubt in your life that's the reason you ain't got to pray your life that's the reason you're so caught up with news and entertainment and the things of the world because you ain't got no victory in your life you're trying to look at somebody else that don't have victory to make you feel a little better uh-oh where did that come from i'm talking about quickening power i'm talking about uh if if this branch if this vine never puts forth another branch it'll be like the original but it's our turn it's our time i say out of my way devil it's my turn my time david wrote a mighty work in israel he cut goliath's head off he served his purpose i can see all the bible characters down through time they serve their purpose what about me lord here i am is there somebody here that will say lord i want to serve my purpose that's the purpose the word has been manifested in this hour that's the purpose of his appearing is to bring forth the potential that's in your life this is a present tense message an on-time message all right now message i end with on this thought here our pastor read this at the end of the morning service out of the easter seal he said it's the hour that is what makes the creation in you you think of abraham and sarah abraham had been believing all those years he'd been believing all those years the word he'd be believing all those years for the promise and it seemed like when the time came where it was too late looked like they missed their opportunity i wonder if you feel that way about something maybe you feel it's too late and you've missed your opportunity there abraham and sarah they had received the word they believed the word and they never wavered on that word imagine how abraham felt and how sarah felt lord you said you gave me the promise but god allowed it to get so dark where their trial seemed like an impossibility but you know what i love about that story their impossibility was god's opportunity and of all of a sudden though the planes of memory sarah's womb dried up abraham was too old they were believing the promised word but there was just seemed like all hope was lost but there come elohim there come melchizedek walking up to him in the tent door where's your wife abraham according to the time of life you're going to have a son he stated the purpose of his appearance he said i'm going to visit you according to the time of life saints do you realize the lord has visited us in this generation and every promised word that you read in the message and in this bible it's your turn to manifest that word that's the purpose of the rising of the sun that's the purpose of the unveiling of god is to bring the seeds that were sown in lady aussie in the manifestation let's just pray heavenly father we just approach you at the end of the service lord we just want to tell you that we love you that we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy lord sometimes we make the message so complicated sometimes we make it so difficult lord and we try to run out on every limb trying to understand everything and we forget lord that you just want to have communion sometimes lord we're busy with things that are right and we're busy with the church house we're busy with family but there you are lord with dirty feet lord may we get back to the the reality of this message lord back to the love relationship with you back to the very purpose you unveiled yourself in this hour was that you could be united together with your bride lord we let the cares of this world and we let things choke the spirit out of our lives maybe lord there's somebody here that wants to lift their hand up and say lord jesus i want that love relationship back lord i've just gotten so busy with the kids i've gotten so busy with work i've gotten so busy with school lord and i feel so far away from you god but i love you i thank you so much lord for dying for me at calvary and taking my place lord you know i love you you know i want to serve you with everything that's in my heart lord there's just so many things pulling on me and so many responsibilities seems like there's no time for anything lord god i just want to repurpose my heart here tonight to you and tell you lord i want to have that communion again lord i want to have that quickening power moving in me lord i want to wake up with a song on my heart i want to wake up with a hunger and thirst to read the bible to listen to the message to find out more about my turn about my part that i play in this hour god there's hands lifted all over the building we just commit them to you lord pray that you'd be their portion we ask it in jesus christ's name [Music] amen [Music] if you feel like
