[10:56] good evening i'm david mcgarry
[11:00] i'm the pastor here and i will not get
[11:02] involved in your meeting
[11:05] very much but we
[11:08] certainly welcome you and
[11:13] i just in my heart for this meeting
[11:17] uh it was the desire of the young people
[11:19] here to have a meeting and
[11:22] we all know that we've been through
[11:25] covid
[11:26] and this shut down and that shut down
[11:29] and everything but you can't shut down
[11:32] the spirit of god
[11:34] and you can't shut down people who are
[11:37] hungering and thirsting
[11:39] after god and i i expect this to be
[11:43] a very special meeting
[11:46] we call it young people meeting but i
[11:50] i'm not going to refer to this as a
[11:52] young people's meeting i'm going to
[11:53] refer to it as a young
[11:55] soldiers meeting and
[11:58] our invite to you i believe most of you
[12:01] i can look out and
[12:02] look at you you spirit filled your
[12:06] you made choices to come here and a
[12:09] scripture come to my heart
[12:10] that is very common with all of us
[12:14] and it says go ye into all the world
[12:18] and preach the gospel to every creature
[12:22] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[12:25] be saved
[12:26] and he that believeth not shall be
[12:29] damned
[12:30] and these signs shall follow them that
[12:32] believe
[12:34] in my name shall they cast out devils
[12:37] they shall speak with new tongues
[12:40] they shall take up serpents and if they
[12:43] drink deadly things
[12:44] it shall not hurt them they shall lay
[12:47] hands on the sick
[12:49] and they shall recover
[12:52] this set of scriptures is what we refer
[12:55] to
[12:56] as the great commission and
[13:00] when i look at you sitting here i
[13:03] remember
[13:05] i guess now 50
[13:08] some years ago 54 years ago
[13:12] when i was 18 years old and i heard the
[13:16] gospel
[13:17] and i took this commission
[13:21] at the age of 18 and
[13:25] this became my goal for my life
[13:29] and i like these meetings as you sit
[13:31] here
[13:32] and listen to these men preach the
[13:35] gospel to you
[13:36] because they're preaching the gospel to
[13:38] you because they have a desire
[13:40] in their heart but i hope that
[13:43] personally
[13:44] you would take these meetings each one
[13:46] of you as an
[13:48] invite to join the commission
[13:52] an invite to join the army
[13:55] and to go to work for the kingdom of god
[13:59] that these words might settle into your
[14:01] heart
[14:02] that you would go into your workplaces
[14:05] you would go into your schools
[14:07] that you would go into your families you
[14:09] would go into your neighborhoods
[14:11] and you would go into your churches and
[14:14] that you'd be on fire
[14:16] for the kingdom of god to carry out this
[14:18] commission
[14:19] because if the lord would tarry another
[14:22] 20 years i probably won't
[14:24] be here but somebody's got to carry on
[14:27] this commission somebody's got to go
[14:30] tell the lost
[14:32] somebody's got to lay hands on the sick
[14:35] somebody's got to cast out the devils
[14:38] and you're that people
[14:42] and so i hope as you hear brother john i
[14:45] know he loves you and he encourages you
[14:48] and you hear the word of god speak to
[14:51] your heart
[14:53] just take every word that the spirit
[14:56] moves
[14:56] on your heart as god recruiting you
[15:02] into his army so you may not want to get
[15:05] drafted but if you come to this meeting
[15:07] you are going to be drafted
[15:09] into the army of the living god amen
[15:13] you're going to be given a
[15:15] a weapon to use you're going to be given
[15:17] a
[15:18] commission you're going to be given
[15:20] orders
[15:21] and let's pray that the holy spirit just
[15:24] stirs you because
[15:25] there's people that it lives that can't
[15:28] be touched
[15:29] by anybody but you nobody can take your
[15:32] place
[15:33] so i i really am proud of the
[15:37] caliber of the young people that
[15:41] came out uh you i can tell by looking at
[15:44] you you
[15:45] you're great believers so i believe that
[15:48] god's got to step higher for us
[15:50] so we're happy that you've come here to
[15:52] join with our
[15:54] youth to seek
[15:57] closer to the lord to seek what his will
[16:00] might be
[16:01] to get him to speak to our hearts and
[16:03] give us direction
[16:05] how that we can serve him better so
[16:08] let us stand as we turn the service over
[16:10] to brother billy

[57:48] lord loves it so you know
[57:50] we might as well get used to it amen

[58:23] in the morning after 10 o'clock
[58:26] is that right brother matthew over at
[58:28] the gym
[58:30] 10 o'clock so if you all want to be
[58:32] there and hear brother trevor that'd be
[58:34] wonderful i plan to be there and i'm
[58:36] looking forward to it
[58:38] i wrote some pages of notes on the
[58:40] airplane i'd like to share with you
[58:42] and um you know we're all together on a
[58:44] friday night we're not downtown at a pub
[58:47] or at a
[58:48] at a movie somewhere we're in the
[58:49] presence of the lord so
[58:51] we can share and talk to one another
[58:53] from our hearts but
[58:54] this weekend in dallas we've not come
[58:57] together this weekend to discuss the
[58:59] weather
[59:01] we're not here to talk about a virus or
[59:04] a global pandemic
[59:05] in fact to be honest with you i'm kind
[59:07] of sick and tired of hearing about the
[59:08] virus
[59:10] and the globe seems like almost every
[59:12] service it gets some sort of credit
[59:14] i think that ought to end and we just
[59:15] ought to say
[59:18] so we're not going to give credit to no
[59:19] virus
[59:21] i'm not here to discuss national
[59:23] politics with you
[59:25] or your local politics or church
[59:27] politics
[59:29] i don't like that anyway i don't think
[59:32] you do
[59:32] either i'm not here to discuss your
[59:35] local
[59:35] or the regional sports teams they're
[59:38] pretty good
[59:39] but i'm not here to speak about the
[59:40] texas rangers
[59:42] or the dallas cowboys or lsu or florida
[59:46] state or the dallas mavericks or the
[59:48] houston texans
[59:50] i heard some were here from houston just
[59:52] wave your hand a little bit
[59:53] are you here yet tonight or okay they're
[59:56] com god bless you
[59:57] we're not going to discuss the houston
[59:59] texans
[1:00:01] or the louisville cardinals or the
[1:00:03] trevor might tomorrow but
[1:00:04] tonight we're not going to or the new
[1:00:06] york yankees
[1:00:08] no soccer team gets any glory no hockey
[1:00:12] team or
[1:00:13] or a barbie doll team whatever you're
[1:00:15] whatever we're into we're not here to
[1:00:17] talk about
[1:00:18] those natural things we're not here to
[1:00:20] go shopping
[1:00:22] we're not here just to socialize i think
[1:00:26] since the announcement they bumped up
[1:00:27] the number so everyone's invited to stay
[1:00:29] after for the food
[1:00:31] isn't that wonderful i think that's
[1:00:33] wonderful brother david and sister
[1:00:34] leslie invited us all to come and
[1:00:37] just want you to be able to feed from
[1:00:39] god's presence and
[1:00:41] feed from um just being young people in
[1:00:44] the message
[1:00:45] that can love the lord together are you
[1:00:47] thankful this church invited us
[1:00:50] thank you very much and you know
[1:00:53] we're not here we're not interested in
[1:00:55] their social media accounts either
[1:00:58] and you're not interested in mine we're
[1:01:01] not here for the preacher
[1:01:03] we're not here for the singers we're not
[1:01:05] here to cause trouble
[1:01:07] or to cause confusion we're here to
[1:01:09] enjoy jesus christ
[1:01:13] and it's just great to be with one
[1:01:14] another this is like heaven to us
[1:01:18] and we recognize that each one of you
[1:01:20] are different
[1:01:22] and each one of you are special i wrote
[1:01:25] these things down so i'm taking the time
[1:01:27] to read
[1:01:29] we're all unique and we're all kind of
[1:01:31] odd all of us
[1:01:32] are but we want you to be able to
[1:01:36] receive we want you to be healed
[1:01:39] if you're sick this is a good place to
[1:01:42] just be healed
[1:01:44] this is a good place to be delivered
[1:01:47] sitting right in your seat you can be
[1:01:50] filled with the holy ghost
[1:01:51] you can be so taken over with the power
[1:01:54] of god
[1:01:55] just five minutes in his presence could
[1:01:58] change
[1:01:58] our lives forever and we're gonna spend
[1:02:01] five minutes together at least tonight
[1:02:03] so let's just be changed do we all agree
[1:02:06] with that
[1:02:08] this weekend we're going to be blessed
[1:02:09] and touched by the lord
[1:02:11] we're all free people amen so we want to
[1:02:14] walk in that liberty
[1:02:16] i don't want you to worry about anything
[1:02:18] and i don't want you to be nervous about
[1:02:20] anything
[1:02:21] god's got it all in control do you
[1:02:24] believe that
[1:02:25] these aren't just little phrases this is
[1:02:26] the truth
[1:02:28] we're sons and daughters of god and
[1:02:30] we're all in a journey
[1:02:32] and we're all at different uh stages of
[1:02:35] our growth
[1:02:36] and our experience and by now
[1:02:39] we should have matured to just respect
[1:02:41] one another
[1:02:42] and have patience for one another as we
[1:02:44] grow together
[1:02:46] because whatever we have in need of is
[1:02:48] in jesus
[1:02:49] do we believe that it is in jesus name
[1:02:53] so we just encourage you to surrender
[1:02:56] just yield these are big secrets
[1:03:00] just be sensitive to the lord tonight be
[1:03:03] listening for a personal
[1:03:05] word from god and be conscious though
[1:03:08] that god is dealing with other people
[1:03:10] too
[1:03:11] and we all take it different brother
[1:03:14] billy we all take it different when god
[1:03:16] talks to us
[1:03:18] some of us get quiet some of us might
[1:03:21] respond
[1:03:22] loudly some might um just listen
[1:03:27] some might just sit there and cry but
[1:03:29] they're soaking it in
[1:03:31] so we want to respect that how god deals
[1:03:34] with others because we're a body
[1:03:36] and we move together i don't want you to
[1:03:38] leave here with brother john's spirit
[1:03:41] i want you to have god's nature and his
[1:03:43] character
[1:03:44] these are some of the greatest times of
[1:03:46] your life
[1:03:47] i think i've said that before but these
[1:03:50] are some of the greatest times of your
[1:03:52] life
[1:03:52] times and meetings like this these are
[1:03:55] sacred
[1:03:56] sands of our experience and i really
[1:03:59] appreciate it
[1:04:01] we believe that god pre-plans and god
[1:04:04] pre-arranges things
[1:04:06] do you believe that even tonight has
[1:04:08] been pre-arranged by god
[1:04:11] these are opportunities for us to draw
[1:04:12] closer to him
[1:04:14] and to one another draw closer to god
[1:04:18] and draw closer to one another i just
[1:04:20] want to say this not to be stern but
[1:04:22] making fun of others will not be
[1:04:24] tolerated
[1:04:26] hello being a bully is sin
[1:04:31] so as young people you know it's good
[1:04:33] for us not to stand for arrogance and
[1:04:35] pride and selfishness
[1:04:37] we live in a me me me and an iphone and
[1:04:40] i this and i that age but when we come
[1:04:42] to the house of god
[1:04:44] eternal life is living for others so
[1:04:47] special meetings and church is like a
[1:04:49] hospital
[1:04:52] in the past year or two we've we've been
[1:04:54] uh reminded of that with
[1:04:56] other young people services that we've
[1:04:58] had and
[1:05:00] so we want these meetings to be a place
[1:05:02] of healing
[1:05:03] for you and where wounds can be healed
[1:05:08] amen you don't have to be embarrassed
[1:05:11] nobody here has to be embarrassed we're
[1:05:13] all trying to find ourselves
[1:05:16] so it's not just for the young people to
[1:05:18] try to find themselves or god's will for
[1:05:21] their lives
[1:05:22] older people are trying to find god's
[1:05:24] will
[1:05:25] if you listen to uh sirs is this the
[1:05:27] time
[1:05:28] the last ten minutes of the service i
[1:05:30] mean i texted that to a senior pastor
[1:05:32] today
[1:05:33] i said the last seven to ten minutes of
[1:05:35] that service says it all
[1:05:38] brother branham was a prophet how many
[1:05:40] believe that he's a major prophet
[1:05:43] and he just got done speaking about six
[1:05:45] dreams
[1:05:46] and visions and he
[1:05:49] at the end of that service said well i'm
[1:05:51] going to go out to tucson then i'm going
[1:05:53] to go up to anchorage
[1:05:55] i'm going to go to denver colorado he
[1:05:57] didn't know where he was going
[1:06:01] hello so stop trying to nail down people
[1:06:05] and say well what are you going to do
[1:06:06] the rest of your life or where are you
[1:06:07] going
[1:06:08] we don't know where we're going abraham
[1:06:11] you know
[1:06:11] sarah believers we're going in the
[1:06:13] rapture
[1:06:15] well what are you going to do for a
[1:06:16] career who are you going to marry you
[1:06:18] know
[1:06:18] god knows all those things but brother
[1:06:20] branham had the holy ghost
[1:06:22] and he was being led by god but he
[1:06:24] didn't know everything
[1:06:26] and we know he went out and met angels
[1:06:28] and and got a sword in his hand
[1:06:30] but he had to walk down off that
[1:06:32] mountain
[1:06:33] i was just there a few weeks ago in
[1:06:36] tucson and you know brother branham
[1:06:38] received that sword into his hand but he
[1:06:40] had to walk down off that mountain
[1:06:42] he had a family and he had a life he
[1:06:44] didn't live there forever
[1:06:46] and you and i do too we come to services
[1:06:49] like this we're going to hear the god's
[1:06:50] word it's going to be very personal
[1:06:52] tonight
[1:06:53] but we got to leave here we got to go
[1:06:55] back to life
[1:06:56] this is our life but we got to go back
[1:06:58] to reflecting life
[1:07:02] so none of us have it all together i'm
[1:07:05] just saying making some comments here
[1:07:07] it's nothing but the truth none of us
[1:07:09] have it all together
[1:07:11] none of us know it all so stop trying to
[1:07:14] be a know-it-all
[1:07:15] you don't have it all together you know
[1:07:18] it looks like preachers or people look
[1:07:19] like they're always in the victory where
[1:07:21] we all got our cross tonight
[1:07:23] we just all happen to be in the building
[1:07:24] or in a service
[1:07:26] bearing our cross we can do it happily
[1:07:28] and joyfully
[1:07:30] or we can just get a spirit on us and be
[1:07:32] like the world
[1:07:34] i just choose to be happy
[1:07:38] none of us are better than anybody else
[1:07:40] nobody's higher than nobody else
[1:07:42] no matter what your skin color is or
[1:07:45] your national language we're all the
[1:07:46] same
[1:07:48] this is some announcements we're making
[1:07:51] we're all in need we're all in need so
[1:07:56] be vulnerable
[1:07:58] be willing to be open stop trying to
[1:08:01] hide behind a facade
[1:08:04] and you know any of you that know
[1:08:06] brother john
[1:08:07] i see some from seattle karina and
[1:08:09] others you know that
[1:08:11] we're different and we're a unique
[1:08:13] speaker
[1:08:14] i don't like to get up way in the clouds
[1:08:16] somewhere i like to
[1:08:17] speak to you from our hearts and just
[1:08:19] let the holy spirit talk to you
[1:08:22] we were born and raised in this message
[1:08:24] we've had the privilege to have a
[1:08:26] believing father and mother that's
[1:08:28] probably streaming right now
[1:08:30] a family that was raised in this message
[1:08:33] uh born and raised in jeffersonville
[1:08:36] and i'm not ashamed of our prophet i'm
[1:08:39] not ashamed to stand with him
[1:08:41] and i'm not ashamed to stand with you
[1:08:43] all of you
[1:08:45] we love you god loves you and i was
[1:08:48] thinking brother billy
[1:08:49] brother matthew on the airplane coming
[1:08:52] here i was thinking how much god must
[1:08:54] love
[1:08:54] you to even talk to you like this
[1:08:59] and to be able to create these times
[1:09:02] the reason that i mention about my past
[1:09:04] or our history is because
[1:09:06] when we minister it's coming from
[1:09:08] another perspective
[1:09:09] and from another position of one that as
[1:09:12] a youth and as a young person
[1:09:14] and as a young adult our whole lives has
[1:09:16] been caught up with this
[1:09:19] and so i think that's um
[1:09:22] not all ministries can reach young
[1:09:24] people we probably should just turn off
[1:09:27] the internet brother
[1:09:28] parks but not all ministers and
[1:09:30] ministries can reach young people
[1:09:33] not all gifts even good gifts have love
[1:09:36] and passion for youth
[1:09:38] and all ministers are unique and
[1:09:42] most definitely i'm not a big minister
[1:09:44] i'm a real small person
[1:09:46] we don't claim to be a big person but
[1:09:48] the trevor is tomorrow he you listen to
[1:09:50] brother trevor tomorrow but
[1:09:53] i'm just a small gift in god's body but
[1:09:56] we do have a deep love for the
[1:09:58] youth of the message i'm not an
[1:10:00] intellectual orator
[1:10:04] we just want to be with jesus this
[1:10:05] weekend we want to give you an
[1:10:07] opportunity
[1:10:08] and i don't know if anyone here is aware
[1:10:11] of this tonight i'm just going to say
[1:10:13] this before we read our scripture
[1:10:15] today is friday may the 14th
[1:10:18] and that's 40 days since easter
[1:10:22] easter was april the 4th today is 40
[1:10:26] days
[1:10:26] we are 40 days since easter and uh when
[1:10:30] jesus was
[1:10:31] here and rose from the dead on easter it
[1:10:34] was on the 40th day
[1:10:36] when jesus ascended up into heaven how
[1:10:39] many recognize that
[1:10:41] last sunday was the was the fifth uh
[1:10:43] week in
[1:10:44] and this is friday it's for it's the
[1:10:46] 40th day
[1:10:48] today was the day on a friday
[1:10:52] that jesus ascended up
[1:10:55] and i just think that's something that
[1:10:58] for us to remember that jesus was making
[1:11:00] himself known his disciples
[1:11:02] and increasing their faith to believe
[1:11:05] that's what he's doing tonight
[1:11:06] he's still with his disciples trying to
[1:11:08] get our faith
[1:11:10] to believe and on the 40th day
[1:11:13] on a friday is jesus tarried with them
[1:11:17] and then he told them to go terry in an
[1:11:19] upper room for 10
[1:11:20] you remember that and when the day of
[1:11:23] pentecost which is 50 that's 50.
[1:11:27] that's when acts chapter 2 took place
[1:11:29] the day of pentecost so
[1:11:31] let's be conscious tonight let's be
[1:11:33] aware of the season we're in
[1:11:35] we're living in bible times so if they
[1:11:38] had their 40 days
[1:11:40] and jesus ascended up we have our time
[1:11:43] this is your time amen so this is our
[1:11:46] time
[1:11:46] and as we stand to our feet we'll turn
[1:11:48] right to the scripture god bless you for
[1:11:50] your patience
[1:11:51] and i'll cut down on my time so our
[1:11:54] opening comments as part of the service
[1:11:57] luke chapter 23
[1:12:04] the last year or 14 months hasn't been
[1:12:07] normal
[1:12:08] for none of us and so we're coming to
[1:12:12] the lord
[1:12:12] to offer ourselves at this season
[1:12:17] because we're getting ready for the
[1:12:18] rapture how many want to make heaven
[1:12:21] your home and
[1:12:22] be together so heavenly father
[1:12:26] as you would sit around the table with
[1:12:27] your family come talk to us tonight
[1:12:30] may the presence of jesus christ come
[1:12:32] into this room
[1:12:34] may you minister to every heart keep our
[1:12:36] attention and
[1:12:37] our focus uh alerted on you lord may
[1:12:40] every single person have their needs met
[1:12:43] in jesus name remember us tonight
[1:12:47] thank you lord amen luke 23
[1:12:51] verse 32 we're going to step back to
[1:12:54] another friday
[1:12:56] this is friday isn't it we're going to
[1:12:59] go back
[1:13:00] to another friday in the scripture it
[1:13:02] was a dark day actually it started early
[1:13:04] in the morning
[1:13:05] late at night last night was the
[1:13:07] communion service and
[1:13:09] today was a long day for jesus
[1:13:13] and uh it's nearing the afternoon time
[1:13:16] it's be
[1:13:16] it's coming to 12 o'clock in between 12
[1:13:19] o'clock and three o'clock
[1:13:22] and so uh if there was a webcam or a
[1:13:25] video
[1:13:26] tonight we'd be we would be looking at
[1:13:28] calvary
[1:13:29] and jesus had already bore his cross up
[1:13:32] the hill
[1:13:34] and we see in verse 32 there were also
[1:13:37] two other
[1:13:38] male factors they were like criminals
[1:13:41] and they were males led with him to be
[1:13:44] put to death
[1:13:46] verse 33 and when they were come to the
[1:13:49] place which is called calvary
[1:13:51] let's all say calvary there
[1:13:54] they crucified him
[1:13:57] and the male factors one on the right
[1:14:00] hand and the other
[1:14:01] on the left then said jesus
[1:14:04] father forgive them for they know not
[1:14:07] what they do you know sometimes as young
[1:14:10] people we need to hear that
[1:14:12] forgive them forgive me they know not
[1:14:16] what they do these were the people that
[1:14:17] had crucified jesus
[1:14:20] and they parted his raiment and cast
[1:14:22] lots
[1:14:24] and the people stood beholding now this
[1:14:27] is embarrassing
[1:14:29] jesus was naked naked in front of the
[1:14:33] church
[1:14:34] naked in front of the young people his
[1:14:37] mother
[1:14:38] mary was there and john but also his
[1:14:41] scoffers and mockers
[1:14:43] people that didn't love jesus were
[1:14:47] making fun and deriding him and this is
[1:14:50] the picture
[1:14:51] on that friday people stood beholding
[1:14:55] and the rulers also with them
[1:14:57] derided him they were yelling out they
[1:15:00] were screaming saying
[1:15:02] he saved others let him save himself if
[1:15:04] he be christ
[1:15:06] or anointed the chosen of god and the
[1:15:08] soldiers also
[1:15:10] mocked him coming to him and offering
[1:15:12] him vinegar and saying
[1:15:14] if thou be the king of the jews save
[1:15:16] thyself
[1:15:17] and a superscription also was written
[1:15:20] over him in letters of greek
[1:15:22] and latin and hebrew this is the king
[1:15:26] of the jews because pilate's wife
[1:15:29] had already been speaking to pilate
[1:15:31] saying don't have anything to do with
[1:15:33] this man and she had suffered all night
[1:15:35] y'all know all this right
[1:15:37] it wasn't a very nice friday
[1:15:40] this is another friday in may
[1:15:44] verse 39 and this is where i want you to
[1:15:48] really
[1:15:48] get a part of the scene as it opens one
[1:15:51] of the male
[1:15:52] factors which were hanged in matthew and
[1:15:55] mark it talks about them being thieves
[1:15:57] the thieves which were hanged railed on
[1:16:01] him
[1:16:01] saying if thou be christ save thyself
[1:16:04] and
[1:16:05] us this was the the guy over here
[1:16:08] on this side here's jesus in the middle
[1:16:12] you're looking at the cross so this guy
[1:16:14] over here he's deriding
[1:16:15] jesus and he's saying things and the
[1:16:17] other answering
[1:16:19] rebuked him saying dost not thou
[1:16:22] fear god see now are in the same
[1:16:25] condemnation that's this
[1:16:26] thief over here if you read in matthew
[1:16:30] it says both of them were doing this at
[1:16:33] the beginning
[1:16:34] both of them didn't understand both of
[1:16:37] them were
[1:16:38] saying these things but something got a
[1:16:39] hold of one of them
[1:16:42] amen and he's talking now to the other
[1:16:44] one these are their last
[1:16:46] breaths of life and they're talking on
[1:16:48] the cross
[1:16:50] to one another and the man over here is
[1:16:53] rebuking
[1:16:54] the other thief over here saying in
[1:16:56] verse 40
[1:16:58] he was rebuking him saying dost not thou
[1:17:00] fear god see now are in the same
[1:17:02] condemnation
[1:17:03] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[1:17:06] due reward of our deeds
[1:17:08] but this man hath done nothing amiss
[1:17:12] and he said unto jesus lord
[1:17:16] remember me when thou comest
[1:17:20] into thy kingdom this is his last words
[1:17:25] and jesus said unto him verily i say
[1:17:28] unto thee
[1:17:28] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[1:17:33] today shalt thou be with me in paradise
[1:17:38] and it was about the sixth hour that's
[1:17:40] twelve o'clock noon
[1:17:41] and there was a darkness over all the
[1:17:43] earth till the ninth hour that's three
[1:17:45] o'clock p.m
[1:17:46] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[1:17:48] the temple was rent
[1:17:49] in the midst god bless you you can have
[1:17:52] your seats tonight
[1:17:57] on this 40th day since easter
[1:18:02] we're taking our title tonight and i
[1:18:04] want every person to listen real closely
[1:18:09] from luke 23 42 three words
[1:18:13] lord remember me
[1:18:20] lord remember me i'm going to take the
[1:18:22] whole service and preach on that
[1:18:24] in the lord great i want you to forget
[1:18:27] about everybody else and i want these
[1:18:29] three words to be your prayer
[1:18:31] this friday night is for you
[1:18:35] we're just going to dig down a little
[1:18:37] bit deeper into three words and
[1:18:39] how it can change a life forever
[1:18:42] but it changed this man's life for
[1:18:44] eternity
[1:18:47] you all still got the picture we're
[1:18:50] looking on the top of mount calvary
[1:18:52] where there's
[1:18:53] three crosses brother branham said most
[1:18:56] people see
[1:18:57] three but there was four
[1:19:00] he said judas went out and hung himself
[1:19:04] he committed suicide right he did what a
[1:19:07] lot of people in the message would do
[1:19:09] when they do when they betray the lord
[1:19:11] they just say oh i'm embarrassed it's
[1:19:13] all over
[1:19:14] there's no future for me he went out and
[1:19:16] committed suicide
[1:19:17] he hung himself on a sycamore tree
[1:19:20] brother branham said most
[1:19:21] people see calvary they see three
[1:19:23] crosses but there was really four
[1:19:26] judas he hung himself
[1:19:30] don't do that young people i'm speaking
[1:19:32] spiritually
[1:19:33] in this time of great darkness on this
[1:19:36] friday
[1:19:37] when it seems like the sun is covered
[1:19:39] over when it seems like
[1:19:40] things in your life or in your situation
[1:19:43] might seem very dark
[1:19:44] on this friday the lord laid this on
[1:19:47] brother john's heart
[1:19:49] days ago to let tonight just be simple
[1:19:53] three words lord
[1:19:56] remember me this came from a man
[1:20:00] that had never been to a youth meeting
[1:20:04] he didn't go to church he wasn't a good
[1:20:08] person
[1:20:09] he never got baptized
[1:20:13] i'm trying to dig down deep here's a man
[1:20:16] that didn't live for
[1:20:18] christ he's a thief
[1:20:22] if you want to go back to isaiah 53
[1:20:26] the bible says prophesying of this event
[1:20:29] in verse 12 that i will divide him a
[1:20:32] portion with the great speaking of
[1:20:34] jesus and he shall divide the spoil with
[1:20:36] the strong
[1:20:37] because he hath poured out his soul unto
[1:20:39] death and he was
[1:20:41] numbered with the transgressors
[1:20:44] jesus was numbered with the
[1:20:45] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[1:20:48] many
[1:20:49] let's all say many the whole world
[1:20:53] even the sins of every person that's in
[1:20:55] this building tonight
[1:20:57] jesus bore your sin
[1:21:00] hallelujah all the young people in the
[1:21:03] message
[1:21:03] and i think this is a weekend for the
[1:21:06] young people so i'm going to focus there
[1:21:09] it's just like if you have a car and you
[1:21:11] have a transmission problem
[1:21:13] you don't go to the quick lube place
[1:21:16] the guy that this is minimum wage or the
[1:21:19] girl that's working there to change your
[1:21:20] oil you need somebody that's trained
[1:21:22] in transmissions if you have an oil you
[1:21:25] know if you have an engine problem you
[1:21:27] don't go
[1:21:28] you know to somebody that does the the
[1:21:30] glasses
[1:21:31] in the front of the vehicle is that
[1:21:33] right you go to people that are trained
[1:21:34] to focus in
[1:21:36] tonight i'm going there god's honing in
[1:21:39] the word is sharp and powerful
[1:21:42] coming right to all of our situations
[1:21:44] and it's causing there to be a prayer
[1:21:46] from your heart back to god lord
[1:21:48] remember me
[1:21:52] every person in this room is better off
[1:21:55] than this man that i'm talking about
[1:21:57] tonight
[1:21:59] he's dirty he's filthy
[1:22:02] he's on a cross the bible says
[1:22:06] jesus was numbered with the
[1:22:08] transgressors that
[1:22:09] there was transgression in his life
[1:22:12] there was transgression in the other
[1:22:14] thief that was railing on him
[1:22:17] and people that were spitting on jesus
[1:22:19] and don't forget that jesus was
[1:22:22] so uh burdened and marred beyond any
[1:22:25] uh his visage was changed he didn't look
[1:22:28] good
[1:22:29] he wasn't going to the mall on a friday
[1:22:31] night with the young people looking all
[1:22:33] good and happy and
[1:22:34] all dressed good his robe was one of
[1:22:37] shame
[1:22:38] i mean drunken soldiers are bartering
[1:22:40] and throwing dice for his garment
[1:22:42] down here and jesus is naked that's a
[1:22:45] horrible friday
[1:22:47] it's not a friday that any of us would
[1:22:49] put on your status
[1:22:52] but this is a night for the believers we
[1:22:55] had to have that night
[1:22:58] we have to have that friday
[1:23:01] we had to have that friday
[1:23:04] and then 40 days later jesus was with
[1:23:07] his disciples for days
[1:23:09] showing himself to thomas and peter and
[1:23:12] other of the disciples to make sure they
[1:23:14] were going to
[1:23:15] believe him and he ascended up
[1:23:18] and they waited for 10 days in an upper
[1:23:20] room and on
[1:23:21] the day of pentecost they were all
[1:23:23] filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:25] how many would you love that tonight
[1:23:26] just the holy spirit would just come and
[1:23:29] just baptize all of us
[1:23:30] just right in this church service just
[1:23:33] wherever
[1:23:34] you're at that's our pentecost
[1:23:37] but i'm going back to this condition
[1:23:40] because the bible says he bear the sin
[1:23:42] of many and made intercession
[1:23:44] for the transgressors tonight's service
[1:23:47] might just be for one person
[1:23:50] it might be for five or ten
[1:23:53] we're a little less than two hundred
[1:23:55] maybe here but this is what the lord
[1:23:57] laid on my heart days ago i wrote it
[1:23:59] down this is our title
[1:24:00] for tonight lord remember me it's a cry
[1:24:04] that comes from the inside of a person
[1:24:08] lord remember my situation
[1:24:13] and this man is hanging on the cross his
[1:24:16] last
[1:24:16] gasp his last words
[1:24:20] never went to an altar never was in a
[1:24:24] prayer line
[1:24:25] never was baptized but in the last few
[1:24:29] seconds of his life
[1:24:30] he recognized that's my only savior
[1:24:35] that's my only way out of this that is
[1:24:38] the answer
[1:24:40] is the man in the middle
[1:24:44] it wasn't the politics of jerusalem
[1:24:47] it wasn't the social media account which
[1:24:50] was already dead he didn't he didn't
[1:24:51] have his cell phone there
[1:24:53] saying pray for me thumbs up you know
[1:24:55] pray for me i'm in a
[1:24:57] dark hour that had all been stripped
[1:24:58] away
[1:25:00] he was in pain
[1:25:03] he's in his la his thoughts are on all
[1:25:05] his misdeeds
[1:25:07] and things they're saying come something
[1:25:09] came out of the innermost part of his
[1:25:11] being to this man in the middle
[1:25:14] remember me
[1:25:18] tonight that's what we need to just hold
[1:25:20] sacred
[1:25:21] all of this lord remember me
[1:25:25] and then if you really want to stretch
[1:25:26] it a little further remember
[1:25:28] us remember here in dallas fort worth
[1:25:31] texas
[1:25:33] it's like the lord rolls out the red
[1:25:35] carpet of his word and he
[1:25:36] gives special attention to us we ought
[1:25:39] to say thank you lord
[1:25:41] all of us as young people need to stop
[1:25:43] taking it for granted
[1:25:45] that we got people that love us and give
[1:25:48] us
[1:25:48] food and provide a place
[1:25:51] we're not out under the tree somewhere
[1:25:54] we're not in
[1:25:55] in the middle of a desert we're not
[1:25:57] gasping on a cross
[1:25:59] for our last breath can everyone breathe
[1:26:02] tonight
[1:26:06] thank you jesus thank you lord
[1:26:09] this isn't going to be a normal service
[1:26:12] all right
[1:26:14] remember me amen
[1:26:18] i just think it's fantastic that the
[1:26:20] lord jesus
[1:26:22] think about this and his last minutes of
[1:26:24] his life
[1:26:25] wasn't so selfish but he was thinking of
[1:26:29] others
[1:26:30] and his last gasp of breath for someone
[1:26:33] that did not deserve it
[1:26:36] probably hadn't even prayed or you know
[1:26:38] been to the church he might have stolen
[1:26:40] from the
[1:26:41] good church people but he's
[1:26:44] praying a prayer or saying some words
[1:26:48] lord remember me and jesus turned to him
[1:26:52] and said
[1:26:53] verily i say unto thee today shalt thou
[1:26:56] be with me in paradise
[1:26:58] somebody say praise the lord i mean and
[1:27:01] maybe i'll get into that tomorrow night
[1:27:03] when i speak on youth with passion
[1:27:06] youth with fire there was a place in the
[1:27:10] old testament
[1:27:11] that all the dead believers went to when
[1:27:13] they died and that was called paradise
[1:27:15] they couldn't go into the
[1:27:16] presence of god and they couldn't go
[1:27:18] into heaven because jesus hadn't died on
[1:27:20] the cross so they went into a
[1:27:22] kind of a holding place brother branham
[1:27:24] talked about that that's where
[1:27:25] you know daniel and sarah and abraham
[1:27:28] and enoch and all the you know
[1:27:29] all the old testament believers they
[1:27:31] went into a place called paradise
[1:27:34] and i'm not going to go into that right
[1:27:36] now but to maybe tomorrow night
[1:27:38] all of a sudden somebody comes knocking
[1:27:40] on the door and comes busting into the
[1:27:42] room
[1:27:42] it's this man i'm talking about he's the
[1:27:46] last one that made it
[1:27:50] i mean the last of the last he comes
[1:27:53] walking into a room and looking around a
[1:27:55] bunch of holy people
[1:27:57] abraham and sarah daniel and shadrach
[1:28:00] meshach and abednego
[1:28:02] that made us stand for christ and he
[1:28:04] thought what am i doing in this room
[1:28:08] how'd i get in this room who made me
[1:28:12] worthy
[1:28:14] and the last man that went into the
[1:28:16] regions of the lost was the other man on
[1:28:18] this side
[1:28:20] what they didn't recognize the man in
[1:28:22] the middle
[1:28:23] could be so close to us tonight the very
[1:28:26] answer
[1:28:27] or the very thing you're desiring could
[1:28:29] be so close to you
[1:28:31] and even if you can't reach there
[1:28:33] physically
[1:28:34] it could just be something that comes
[1:28:36] out of your heart and your words
[1:28:38] remember me that could touch the heart
[1:28:41] of god
[1:28:43] and literally transform your whole life
[1:28:47] how many believe the bible when jesus
[1:28:49] said today
[1:28:50] shalt thou be with me in paradise how
[1:28:52] many believe he made it
[1:28:56] did he deserve hell this man that's
[1:28:59] hanging over here did he deserve hell
[1:29:02] we all came lost in iniquity
[1:29:06] even if you're raised in a message home
[1:29:08] a message
[1:29:09] church and have good family or whatever
[1:29:12] we're all lost
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:16] so tonight i'd just like to dig deep
[1:29:18] into this
[1:29:19] lord remember me lord
[1:29:23] let's all say lord when you say that you

[1:31:17] we're not addressing we're not admiring
[1:31:20] just some person like that of the world
[1:31:22] or a teacher or a professor
[1:31:24] that you might have as a young person
[1:31:27] this is not a mother
[1:31:29] you're not crying out for mother brother
[1:31:31] branham was

[1:31:35] and blood is going everywhere
[1:31:37] and he he's falling falling falling down
[1:31:41] and he cried out for his mother

[1:32:05] your auntie or your
[1:32:07] uncle or some family member
[1:32:10] this is jesus some of you need to look
[1:32:13] away

[1:32:43] jesus
[1:32:44] lord amen
[1:32:49] it's more than a preacher

[1:32:59] brother if i could just have your
[1:33:01] number can i get your number and text

[1:38:36] days ago when he laid this on my heart
[1:38:38] it was like a missile
[1:38:39] he was coming right down to your heart
[1:38:41] he was already preparing

[1:39:02] looking on
[1:39:04] i'm encouraging you tonight to engage
[1:39:07] be connected with christ plug into the
[1:39:10] word
[1:39:12] this is jesus we're talking about
[1:39:16] and finally lord remember me
[1:39:21] lord remember me as personal
[1:39:25] even tonight sitting right here you
[1:39:28] might not think you need him
[1:39:30] you might not you might think everything
[1:39:32] is all good i'm good
[1:39:35] you might be able to drive you might be
[1:39:37] able to do
[1:39:38] fun things but you let something happen
[1:39:41] like a young man some few days ago
[1:39:43] driving and just
[1:39:45] driving so fast and just drove a little
[1:39:48] bit
[1:39:48] over the edge of the the asphalt and got
[1:39:50] into the loose gravel and just
[1:39:52] invite and tonight he's no longer alive
[1:39:56] this friday night he's not breathing
[1:40:00] all right they buried him in the ground
[1:40:03] last saturday and this is amazing
[1:40:07] as ministers you know it's amazing how
[1:40:10] somebody can be alive
[1:40:11] and lifting their hands and they can be
[1:40:14] going and passionate and let's go
[1:40:18] and in less than a you could be putting
[1:40:22] them down into the ground
[1:40:25] ashes to ashes dust to death
[1:40:28] as i saw it just the other day as
[1:40:30] someone shared with me and i saw
[1:40:33] a video clip i think it was africa
[1:40:35] somewhere and they were just
[1:40:36] you know putting shovels of dirt on the
[1:40:38] casket
[1:40:39] it's all over brother billy like we can
[1:40:41] be fancy
[1:40:42] we can talk we can eat food
[1:40:45] we can love life we can laugh
[1:40:49] we can say it's all good how you doing
[1:40:51] tonight oh good
[1:40:53] but when it really comes down to where
[1:40:56] the rubber meets the road
[1:40:58] we want to make sure whether it's family
[1:41:00] or friends and
[1:41:02] somebody in the church when they're
[1:41:03] shoveling in a little shovel full of
[1:41:05] dirt that
[1:41:06] it falls on your casket that we can have
[1:41:09] some confidence
[1:41:11] come on friends i mean give us enough
[1:41:14] something to put you on the other side
[1:41:17] because i can guarantee you that
[1:41:19] preacher that takes your service
[1:41:21] can't put you in heaven
[1:41:25] you've already lived your life you
[1:41:26] already made your decision
[1:41:29] you lived your youth you were strong
[1:41:32] once you had it
[1:41:33] you had words i don't see any
[1:41:36] wheelchairs here tonight brother
[1:41:38] matthew brother jim i don't see no
[1:41:40] crutches unless they're under the seat
[1:41:42] y'all look like a pretty healthy bunch
[1:41:46] you know when brother branham had
[1:41:48] meetings are we doing okay
[1:41:52] brother jackson we're doing okay when
[1:41:54] brother branham had meetings the whole
[1:41:56] front section was full of stretchers
[1:41:58] cuts wheelchairs
[1:42:02] there were smells in the church because
[1:42:04] people had all kinds of diseases
[1:42:06] and blood they were trying to cover up
[1:42:08] their sides because they had blood
[1:42:11] some were sexual um diseases they had
[1:42:14] because they had ran around
[1:42:17] but there was something called the word
[1:42:19] that went forth
[1:42:22] and only believe that was trying to
[1:42:24] create an atmosphere
[1:42:28] that whoever's in that service there
[1:42:29] could be three words come from their
[1:42:31] heart
[1:42:32] that would have the ability to change
[1:42:34] their life
[1:42:37] say what are you talking about brother
[1:42:38] john lord remember
[1:42:40] me
[1:42:44] you see me you know me and they got us
[1:42:47] off of stretchers
[1:42:51] where sister sharapov lives down in
[1:42:53] tacoma
[1:42:54] years ago when brother branham was down
[1:42:56] there in tacoma and there's pictures and
[1:42:58] everything all around the platform as
[1:43:00] cots and
[1:43:00] all kinds of people with needs and
[1:43:02] troubles they were like in the front
[1:43:05] today if we've got a problem or a need
[1:43:07] we don't want nobody to know about it
[1:43:10] you know we dress the part we get it all
[1:43:12] together we come to church
[1:43:15] something's changed over the years i'm
[1:43:18] just starting to feel comfortable
[1:43:19] amen you know back then they like came
[1:43:23] with their needs all out there you know
[1:43:26] it's all out there brother
[1:43:29] today you know it seems like we want to
[1:43:31] cover it all up
[1:43:33] we don't want nobody to know
[1:43:37] is that right in fact brother john knows
[1:43:40] this to be true there
[1:43:41] he would go right down the aisle and
[1:43:43] he'd start saying you sister hears you
[1:43:45] got cancer
[1:43:45] and you got this in this trouble and you
[1:43:47] got that how many knows he'd go right
[1:43:49] down and there were serious needs
[1:43:52] you got tb you got tumors you got this
[1:43:54] in your life he'd go right one right and
[1:43:56] this wasn't small things
[1:43:58] today i wonder if the lord would go
[1:44:00] right now it wouldn't be things like
[1:44:02] that
[1:44:03] we can see you look healthy you look
[1:44:06] strong
[1:44:07] it's moved into another level it's moved
[1:44:10] into mental
[1:44:11] issues and mental strains and troubles
[1:44:14] where
[1:44:14] it's hard to focus for 20 minutes all
[1:44:17] the add and this and that and problems
[1:44:20] and issues in life and
[1:44:21] satan's trying to throw you into some
[1:44:23] mental strain that can be worse than a
[1:44:25] physical strength
[1:44:27] and if you've got a physical issue it's
[1:44:29] more obvious
[1:44:30] but you got something that can be hidden
[1:44:32] you can cover that over
[1:44:34] you can kind of mask that say i got it
[1:44:37] all together
[1:44:38] and it just might be about ready to
[1:44:40] crash
[1:44:45] i pray tonight that you and i would live
[1:44:48] enough
[1:44:49] of our lives for christ that there would
[1:44:51] be enough evidence
[1:44:53] to put me into heaven i don't need a
[1:44:55] preacher or a pastor
[1:44:57] some person to say brother john this
[1:45:00] sister so and though this
[1:45:01] let there be enough evidence to say she
[1:45:04] loved the lord
[1:45:06] he loved the lord i could see the holy
[1:45:09] ghost
[1:45:10] on that person brother branham said i
[1:45:12] talk to a person for two minutes
[1:45:14] and tell whether they have the holy
[1:45:16] ghost i got that here
[1:45:18] two minutes and he said and you can too
[1:45:25] so we need to stop playing games we're
[1:45:27] talking about eternity we're
[1:45:29] we're talking about a man that is like
[1:45:31] fixed
[1:45:34] on a cross saying lord remember me
[1:45:38] why is it so hard for us to say that

[1:45:47] or swahili or spanish

[1:45:56] grades of our english or our s.a.t
[1:45:58] scores

[1:46:33] voice coming out of this little this
[1:46:35] little building tonight to the lord

[1:46:39] how many know brother branham said your
[1:46:41] your thoughts
[1:46:42] are heard louder in heaven
[1:46:46] i didn't even finish it so you all said
[1:46:48] amen your thoughts
[1:46:50] are heard louder in heaven than your

[1:46:59] our groanings the real you
[1:47:04] what you're going through our thoughts

[1:47:44] and that and really it's our thoughts
[1:47:48] that's being broadcast through heaven
[1:47:51] that's louder than our words down on
[1:47:54] earth
[1:47:55] we can be all so loud vocally and it's
[1:47:58] like the angels probably just turn them
[1:48:00] down
[1:48:00] turn them down when they start thinking
[1:48:02] later tonight that's the real person
[1:48:04] and i think some of us would maybe be
[1:48:06] embarrassed
[1:48:09] and we just need to come to the reality
[1:48:11] lord remember me
[1:48:14] we are what we are by the grace of god
[1:48:17] but is it god's great
[1:48:19] grace great come on everyone i'm just
[1:48:22] giving you a moment
[1:48:24] is god's grace great it'll reach right
[1:48:27] down and cover the multitude of sins
[1:48:30] but you and i've got to be willing to
[1:48:33] say those words
[1:48:35] huge words lord remember me
[1:48:38] i'm not asking you to quote a paragraph
[1:48:41] or recite a chapter
[1:48:43] tonight's very simple and and don't
[1:48:45] stumble over it
[1:48:47] over simplicity the message sunday
[1:48:50] morning
[1:48:51] before the seven seals god in simplicity
[1:48:54] and then the sunday after the very
[1:48:57] sunday after
[1:48:58] god in simplicity it's like god knew
[1:49:01] that we as humans needed it like a
[1:49:03] sandwich
[1:49:04] everything in the middle is important
[1:49:06] but god in simplicity
[1:49:07] and god and simplicity i know you need
[1:49:10] the opening of the seven's heels
[1:49:12] and and the thunders and the you know
[1:49:14] the deep mysteries but you need
[1:49:15] god in simplicity
[1:49:19] if you're tripping up over kindergarten
[1:49:21] you can't graduate
[1:49:23] it's time to go to the next level it's
[1:49:26] time for the young people the message to
[1:49:28] start speaking the word
[1:49:30] and for it's not the minister and the
[1:49:33] whole focus even in the last 14 months
[1:49:35] globally
[1:49:36] we've seen a lot of places streaming and
[1:49:38] zooming and it's like the whole focus is
[1:49:40] the preacher the preacher the one man
[1:49:42] and you know you know keep it focused
[1:49:44] there because we're not all wearing
[1:49:46] masks and blah blah blah blah blah

[1:49:58] sisters we're all part of a body

[1:53:59] that that brother just seems to be not
[1:54:02] as connected as

[1:54:18] my friend or someone in my family
[1:54:22] brother john really needs the lord

[1:54:28] go up in requests and desires for
[1:54:30] other people and would we all agree
[1:54:32] tonight there are other people
[1:54:34] that have more desperate needs than us
[1:54:37] would you all agree

[1:54:45] worse off than we are we need to thank
[1:54:48] god for good health

[1:54:52] you got to thank god for feet
[1:54:54] legs lungs hands
[1:54:57] can somebody praise the lord a little
[1:54:58] bit hands hallelujah
[1:55:10] i'm asking you to remember the lord
[1:55:13] because that's part of communion is
[1:55:15] remembering the lord
[1:55:16] remembering him but tonight it's
[1:55:19] you're you saying lord remember me means
[1:55:22] there's been a connection
[1:55:24] there's a lot of other people that have
[1:55:26] more desperate needs than you and i
[1:55:28] and there's more urgent cries
[1:55:32] like we're all sitting here but in just
[1:55:35] a few hours there could be a car turned
[1:55:37] upside down
[1:55:37] flipped over and gasoline going out and
[1:55:40] somebody gets more urgent
[1:55:42] i mean you that are not showing a lot of
[1:55:44] emotion which show a lot of emotion it's
[1:55:46] like let's get out of here what's going
[1:55:47] to happen
[1:55:49] get me out of here
[1:55:53] urgent cries my baby
[1:55:59] do you remember the young man in memphis
[1:56:01] that
[1:56:03] went down the wrong road and it was
[1:56:05] sexual sin
[1:56:07] brother branham used the word social
[1:56:08] disease we might as well call it what it
[1:56:10] is
[1:56:11] he had went down the wrong road and he
[1:56:13] was from a good family and his mother
[1:56:15] was a real good believer
[1:56:17] but i'm talking personal
[1:56:20] and he's out there like rowing in a dark
[1:56:23] place
[1:56:25] and a mother is praying for him
[1:56:29] and got a hold of a prophet that was
[1:56:31] flying in an airplane and caused it to
[1:56:34] settle overnight
[1:56:35] and god had enough love for a young man
[1:56:38] that was like
[1:56:39] the thief on the cross
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:44] he had a good mama he was under the
[1:56:47] token we would say
[1:56:49] he came from a family that she knew how
[1:56:52] to pray
[1:56:53] there's most of us that probably would
[1:56:54] have had this kind of attitude
[1:56:58] you know like where did he get in that
[1:57:00] place i mean he's
[1:57:02] looking his own house says has good
[1:57:04] atmosphere and everything
[1:57:09] we look down on one another how did you
[1:57:11] get in this place
[1:57:12] you know better than that you know what
[1:57:15] i mean and we get this attitude about it
[1:57:19] help us lord but by the end of the story
[1:57:24] oh mama oh mama it's getting light
[1:57:28] around here
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:29] [Applause]
[1:57:31] and some time later goes by and the same
[1:57:34] young man is down by the
[1:57:35] the train station and he's waving
[1:57:37] brother man and brother branham don't
[1:57:39] you recognize me no i don't think i
[1:57:41] recognize you
[1:57:42] not not only did god heal me but i
[1:57:45] saved too
[1:57:51] somebody had time to pray for him
[1:57:54] somebody had him in an atmosphere
[1:57:57] somebody said lord
[1:57:58] remember us we need you to come by our
[1:58:01] way
[1:58:02] and god came by his way i say god give
[1:58:05] us
[1:58:06] more times like that in 2021 that you
[1:58:09] can come by our way lord
[1:58:11] where the lights can come on for
[1:58:13] somebody it's just they're just sitting
[1:58:15] in a meeting and all of a sudden the
[1:58:16] lights are coming on
[1:58:17] feelings coming back again it's like
[1:58:20] they're all flesh and that like gray
[1:58:22] looking
[1:58:22] and by the end of the service by the end
[1:58:24] of the meeting it's just like a
[1:58:26] sweetness settles over them
[1:58:28] it's the love of god constraining their
[1:58:31] heart it's like they've been in an
[1:58:32] atmosphere
[1:58:33] it's like they've been in a a breathing
[1:58:36] room it's like breathe in
[1:58:37] breathe out breathe in
[1:58:40] breathe out
[1:58:44] if you don't you're gonna die some of
[1:58:46] you holding your breath

[2:05:19] right it was friends she was like
[2:05:23] what did he say what did he say there
[2:05:24] because you've chosen the harder way
[2:05:27] a huge portion of heaven away
[2:05:32] and i called you to be a prophet to
[2:05:34] preach to a generation
[2:05:36] and i'm going to take you off the scene
[2:05:38] and i'm going to let
[2:05:39] years go by in the message and raise up
[2:05:41] a whole new
[2:05:42] another generation that never knew the
[2:05:45] prophet
[2:05:46] he didn't we didn't hunt with him we
[2:05:48] didn't fish with him
[2:05:49] so we look beyond him and we see jesus
[2:05:54] i see jesus all the big name preachers
[2:05:58] all the one man ministries they fade
[2:06:00] away all the
[2:06:02] huge doctrines it's called splits and
[2:06:04] old fighters
[2:06:07] god's raising up a generation that
[2:06:10] aren't interested in none of that
[2:06:13] we're not interested in it give me jesus
[2:06:17] just talk to me straight preach the
[2:06:20] gospel
[2:06:22] so tonight lord remember us here in
[2:06:24] dallas texas
[2:06:25] there's more serious requests and more
[2:06:28] urgent cries
[2:06:30] but if it what would it profit us if we
[2:06:33] save the whole world and lose ourselves
[2:06:36] do you all know that song here it's an
[2:06:38] old time song it's not my brother
[2:06:40] or my sister but it's me oh lord
[2:06:43] standing in the need of prayer have you
[2:06:45] ever heard that song
[2:06:47] it's not my mother or my father but it's
[2:06:49] me o lord
[2:06:51] not the preacher or the deacon but it's
[2:06:53] me o lord it's me
[2:06:55] lord remember me i'm on my cross tonight
[2:06:59] i'm fixed here
[2:07:03] i'm here lord speaking to you i need you
[2:07:06] lord
[2:07:08] tonight i hear the cry of the youth of
[2:07:10] the message
[2:07:12] i hear it like a blading
[2:07:16] of lambs or of sheep
[2:07:20] i hear the cry of the youth of the
[2:07:22] message globally
[2:07:25] saying i want to see the same lord jesus
[2:07:27] that i've heard about
[2:07:29] i want to see him made real today
[2:07:32] i'm not interested in just to pass jesus
[2:07:36] we can talk about jesus on the cross all
[2:07:38] night long
[2:07:39] and cry and worship and all of that but
[2:07:41] i want to see him
[2:07:42] walk into this room and make himself
[2:07:45] known to somebody
[2:07:46] that would just generate something from
[2:07:48] the depths of your soul
[2:07:50] that would say lord remember me
[2:07:56] tonight you're not despised
[2:08:00] the young people of the message are not
[2:08:02] despised by god
[2:08:04] you're not an afterthought in fact
[2:08:07] you're not children anymore
[2:08:09] when the voice spoke to brother branham
[2:08:11] and said um
[2:08:13] there's a work for you to do when you
[2:08:15] get older
[2:08:16] he was younger and god called some of
[2:08:19] you
[2:08:20] to be christians and give your life to
[2:08:22] him when you were younger
[2:08:24] but you're not younger there's a work
[2:08:26] for you to do
[2:08:28] and tonight we're going to get into that
[2:08:29] more god called peter
[2:08:31] to be his disciple and he said come
[2:08:33] follow me
[2:08:35] come follow me and he dropped his
[2:08:37] fishing nets and he
[2:08:39] followed the lord many of you have
[2:08:41] followed the lord for years
[2:08:43] but then after jesus went through his
[2:08:45] week of the passion
[2:08:47] do you all remember that acts 1 3
[2:08:51] the passion of his death tomorrow night
[2:08:54] i'm speaking on
[2:08:55] youth with passion and we think of
[2:08:59] passion in a certain way but god's
[2:09:01] trying to get your thoughts turned a
[2:09:03] little bit after
[2:09:04] jesus died on the cross he came to peter
[2:09:07] and said
[2:09:08] follow me in other words it's not just
[2:09:10] follow me to be a disciple
[2:09:12] follow me to give your heart to christ
[2:09:15] follow me to baptism
[2:09:16] most of you've done that he's trying to
[2:09:19] get you to recognize that life isn't all
[2:09:21] fun and gain
[2:09:23] follow me to death are you able to take
[2:09:26] up your cross
[2:09:28] and follow me peter peter i'm trying to
[2:09:31] get your attention
[2:09:32] i'm in the 40 days i've only got a few
[2:09:36] minutes with you
[2:09:37] i'm trying to grab a hold of your heart
[2:09:40] and on the 40th of the day jesus went up
[2:09:43] into heaven
[2:09:45] he was gone and they could no longer
[2:09:48] touch him
[2:09:49] and fish oh i would die for you
[2:09:52] but he needed an experience peter needed
[2:09:55] an experience
[2:09:56] of that same jesus coming inside of him
[2:09:59] and oh god may that happen for all of us
[2:10:01] that it's not just
[2:10:03] god up there god over there god in
[2:10:06] jeffersonville
[2:10:07] god in tucson but god here
[2:10:10] god where's the revival in the message
[2:10:14] it's right here
[2:10:17] that's what they said over in europe
[2:10:19] when they said where's the welsh revival
[2:10:21] they
[2:10:21] they flew away over there and their big
[2:10:22] hats and their turn where's the welsh
[2:10:24] revival
[2:10:25] and that policeman just twirling his
[2:10:27] behind he said you finally arrived
[2:10:31] he didn't say well it's down this road
[2:10:32] and turn left and right at the third
[2:10:34] light and all of it
[2:10:35] he said you're looking at it i've
[2:10:38] experienced it i met him
[2:10:41] i prayed lord remember me and you know
[2:10:43] what happened

[2:10:47] me

[2:10:54] you
[2:10:56] you're part of his body he loves you
[2:11:04] he died to save you he creates these
[2:11:09] opportunities for somebody to say it in
[2:11:11] another way
[2:11:14] lord remember me tomorrow
[2:11:17] remember me on monday when i've got to
[2:11:19] go back to school and
[2:11:20] back to my situation at home and back to
[2:11:24] my life lord i
[2:11:26] i'm sorry but a lot of us have become
[2:11:29] message druggies

[2:11:33] and a fix and
[2:11:34] when's the next meeting and when's the
[2:11:35] next this and where we can we go and
[2:11:38] the same ones that didn't have the holy

[2:11:49] say god met me
[2:11:52] he failed me he remembered me
[2:11:54] [Music]
[2:11:55] [Applause]
[2:11:59] where's the young people in our churches
[2:12:01] that can grow
[2:12:02] and mature and become the church where
[2:12:06] we're not backslidden and we don't
[2:12:07] always fall back
[2:12:09] and we don't need another weekend to
[2:12:11] have another drug
[2:12:12] fix i live on these drugs i gotta have
[2:12:15] it in the morning
[2:12:16] gotta have it in the day i got some of
[2:12:18] your attention amen
[2:12:19] it's not weed just because they make
[2:12:21] marijuana legal don't make it
[2:12:23] holy
[2:12:26] i think i said that here before you know
[2:12:28] just because they legalize things don't
[2:12:30] make it righteous
[2:12:32] we still need to shun the very
[2:12:34] appearance of evil
[2:12:36] and some of you need to realize that too
[2:12:38] much time on your
[2:12:40] on your devices is sin
[2:12:46] and you really show who you love by
[2:12:49] where you spend your time
[2:12:52] and we can have so much face time or so
[2:12:54] much screen time and
[2:12:55] how much time do we have with jesus we
[2:12:58] show it when we leave by what
[2:13:00] how we live whether you've been with the
[2:13:03] husband
[2:13:04] we can talk old you know we're older
[2:13:08] you can tell you've been with someone if
[2:13:10] the life is flowing out of you
[2:13:11] automatically
[2:13:12] hallelujah do you all know what i'm
[2:13:14] talking about
[2:13:16] so in conclusion tonight there was a
[2:13:18] young lady
[2:13:20] she's just from the time she was 15
[2:13:22] years old 16 years old
[2:13:24] she was stricken with tuberculosis
[2:13:29] and she was in a horrible situation
[2:13:32] she was a teenager and her father was a
[2:13:36] deacon and her mother was a staunch
[2:13:38] person but they weren't message
[2:13:39] believers in fact they
[2:13:41] kind of were making fun of healing and
[2:13:43] things but this young lady
[2:13:45] had heard about someone else being
[2:13:47] healed and she began to just cry out in
[2:13:49] her heart
[2:13:50] cry out for healing i mean it was so bad
[2:13:52] and so horrible
[2:13:54] she laying in her bed just that she
[2:13:57] couldn't even go to the bathroom
[2:13:59] they just pulling the bed sheets out and
[2:14:02] changing it and things and
[2:14:03] it was horrible she went down to 30
[2:14:06] something pounds she went from a strong
[2:14:09] teenager now she's 25 years old but it
[2:14:12] got to a place where she just
[2:14:13] started to cry out like a lamb blading
[2:14:26] does anybody know that i'm here laying
[2:14:28] in this
[2:14:29] bed does anybody know i've passed
[2:14:33] easter i passed my birthday
[2:14:36] i passed christmas all the youth
[2:14:39] meetings they're all having and i'm in
[2:14:41] this bed
[2:14:43] 16 years old sweet 16
[2:14:46] 18 19 i'm just fading away
[2:14:49] does anybody even care anymore
[2:14:53] i'm in a no-name town
[2:14:56] that even a prophet don't know about man
[2:14:59] i've gone really low brother jackson
[2:15:03] even my preacher don't believe in divine
[2:15:06] healing
[2:15:06] and i need help brother
[2:15:13] and it was the cry of a human
[2:15:16] but in another dimension a man that was
[2:15:20] close to god heard it like a lamb
[2:15:28] like a lamb bleeding
[2:15:33] it's the most pitiful thing in the world
[2:15:34] just blading bleeding that's a poor
[2:15:36] little
[2:15:37] thing and and there was he just had a
[2:15:39] burden i've got to find that person i
[2:15:42] gotta get to that young person
[2:15:44] feed my lambs
[2:15:47] feed my sheep and just the prayers and
[2:15:51] the burden and even
[2:15:52] said the name of the place to go to and
[2:15:54] he didn't know where
[2:15:56] that city was and finally brother wright
[2:15:58] knew where to go and they went down
[2:16:00] there and there had been things happen
[2:16:01] in the church
[2:16:02] it was a church and the minister had
[2:16:04] done some things and the people had
[2:16:06] scattered
[2:16:07] the church was closed up they were just
[2:16:09] using it kind of for funerals and things
[2:16:11] and the city had taken over and the
[2:16:13] congregation
[2:16:14] had all left and went to other churches
[2:16:20] and the man prayed lord if you want me
[2:16:22] in this church you're going to have to
[2:16:23] unlock these doors
[2:16:25] [Music]
[2:16:26] and the man came walking around and said
[2:16:28] i see you here do you want to get inside
[2:16:29] i got the keys you know
[2:16:31] god works on both ends of the line
[2:16:34] tonight before you even pray
[2:16:36] lord remember me god had already sent
[2:16:39] the answer
[2:16:40] he already is the answer the answer's
[2:16:44] hanging in the middle
[2:16:47] you don't have to run away to another
[2:16:49] continent
[2:16:51] the peace that you're craving for in
[2:16:53] your heart isn't across the ocean
[2:16:56] it's not in another relationship it's
[2:16:58] not
[2:16:59] because down the road there's tears and
[2:17:01] sorrow
[2:17:02] and even in god's perfect will it's not
[2:17:05] always easy
[2:17:06] there's a lot of crying and pains i know
[2:17:09] what i'm talking about
[2:17:12] so now a teenager had become a young
[2:17:14] lady
[2:17:16] and a young person a young adult we
[2:17:17] would say blading blading
[2:17:21] my my my and it just seems like nobody
[2:17:23] has time they're too busy
[2:17:26] they're so worried about the music or
[2:17:29] the church order
[2:17:30] or the virus oh i gave it more credit
[2:17:34] or they're worried about this or that
[2:17:36] and nobody has even time
[2:17:38] where's the oil where's the wine i need
[2:17:40] help

[2:17:44] i've been knocked off my horse i'm in
[2:17:47] trouble
[2:17:48] and and we get too busy

[2:18:15] talking and talking and enjoying one
[2:18:17] another that's wonderful that's
[2:18:18] fantastic

[2:19:01] see everyone back there but
[2:19:03] if you don't need this maybe it's for
[2:19:05] somebody over here
[2:19:06] but it's like lord minister to them let
[2:19:09] the holy spirit just come right over
[2:19:11] that person

[2:19:14] them before we leave
[2:19:16] and it's not going to be coca-cola that
[2:19:18] gets us in the rapture

[2:19:55] what happened in the book of hats
[2:19:57] what about you sisters over here just
[2:19:59] wave your hand a little bit and your
[2:20:01] shadow goes over three other
[2:20:03] sisters and you just see that depressive
[2:20:05] dark cloud just leave
[2:20:07] [Applause]
[2:20:09] now that's a youth meeting that's young
[2:20:12] people that know their position
[2:20:14] they know they have authority take all
[2:20:17] the devils and demons in this place
[2:20:19] under your control well you say brother
[2:20:22] branham prayed that
[2:20:23] where is the generation that your
[2:20:26] prophet said
[2:20:27] that that wave sheath was cut it was the
[2:20:30] mess and waved over the field
[2:20:34] saying there's more out in the field
[2:20:35] that's going to come to maturity
[2:20:38] [Applause]
[2:20:41] and but we got all the focus on the
[2:20:43] ministry and on the minister and
[2:20:45] they're going to lay hands on me they're
[2:20:46] going to pray the prayer of faith and
[2:20:48] god's trying to say you pray the
[2:20:50] paraphrase
[2:20:50] [Applause]
[2:20:54] we're not passing out pacifiers tonight
[2:20:56] you're old enough where
[2:20:57] the diapers and all of that god's
[2:20:59] trained us long enough
[2:21:00] and i'm not speaking negative about none
[2:21:02] of that there was a time when a nurse
[2:21:04] needed to pull us out of the womb
[2:21:06] there was a time when a daddy and a
[2:21:07] mother and a minister needed to be there
[2:21:09] to
[2:21:09] encourage us and guide us down that road
[2:21:12] less
[2:21:12] traveled but we're you've grown now
[2:21:15] there ought to be a traveled road
[2:21:18] where you can say i've been with jesus
[2:21:22] [Music]
[2:21:23] i'm not messing around i'm not playing
[2:21:25] hands just playing hands and footsies
[2:21:27] under the table i mean
[2:21:28] business brother john hallelujah
[2:21:32] that wasn't in my notes either but it's
[2:21:34] good to say it
[2:21:36] god's raising up a generation of young
[2:21:38] men and women
[2:21:40] that can pass their parents go beyond
[2:21:43] the faith of their ministers and go
[2:21:44] beyond the
[2:21:45] people in the sound booth and and the
[2:21:47] trustees and deacons and many old people
[2:21:50] sitting back there
[2:21:51] mocking and scoffing and saying we've
[2:21:53] gone long enough well there's somebody
[2:21:54] saying
[2:21:55] i need more of this i need jesus
[2:22:02] so i've been longer and i need to close
[2:22:04] but this young lady finally began to cry
[2:22:07] out to god
[2:22:08] and god brought brother branham to her
[2:22:09] house
[2:22:11] georgie carter i pray god fill our youth
[2:22:14] group with a bunch of georgie carter
[2:22:16] a bunch of teenagers and girls in their
[2:22:18] 20s that she needed to get to jesus she
[2:22:20] couldn't even get out of her bed
[2:22:22] so jesus had to come to her
[2:22:25] and her mother didn't believe in divine
[2:22:27] healing finally her dad said whatever
[2:22:29] and the preacher said okay you can have
[2:22:31] him come over and see you
[2:22:35] and brother branham was praying as you
[2:22:37] know
[2:22:41] and there was a little book of brother
[2:22:42] branham's laying there by the side of
[2:22:44] the bed and
[2:22:46] she got to where her hands had been put
[2:22:48] back on the side of her bed i've been in
[2:22:50] this room i've met georgie carter
[2:22:52] personally brother trevor
[2:22:53] you've probably been there sister edmund
[2:22:55] you've probably been there and
[2:22:56] her hands as a teenager it got so on the
[2:22:59] back of her bed just
[2:23:01] i'm reading here the paint was rubbed
[2:23:02] off the bed where she had held
[2:23:04] and cried and prayed for deliverance
[2:23:08] her church didn't believe in divine
[2:23:10] healing and she got this
[2:23:11] book and she seen in the paper where
[2:23:13] another girl had been healed
[2:23:15] and she wanted to be healed some of us
[2:23:18] need to get sick and tired
[2:23:20] of being sick and tired
[2:23:24] and we need to say lord remember me
[2:23:25] tonight
[2:23:30] god met brother branham and the holy
[2:23:31] spirit swept through that place
[2:23:33] and gave brother branham a word and said
[2:23:35] go by the way of carters
[2:23:37] said her name i tell you god knows your
[2:23:40] name
[2:23:41] hallelujah god knows your name
[2:23:44] he knows your address he knows your
[2:23:46] phone number
[2:23:48] he knows the need in your life and
[2:23:50] brother branham how many remembers the
[2:23:52] time
[2:23:52] brother branham would call out and say
[2:23:54] is there anybody here that would like to
[2:23:56] give
[2:23:56] and they would raise their hand and then
[2:23:57] he would say would you just
[2:24:00] come forward and none of them come
[2:24:01] forward i think there was one young man
[2:24:04] was there one all right and brother
[2:24:05] brown said i pray it would be another
[2:24:07] isaiah
[2:24:09] then brother branham dropped back in
[2:24:10] discernment in this one message
[2:24:12] and i think there was 13 people he'd
[2:24:14] begin to call him out
[2:24:15] call him out and you back there the
[2:24:17] people begin to wail and ah
[2:24:19] oh the whole audience now he said now
[2:24:21] who would like to come
[2:24:22] and give your heart and he said it was
[2:24:24] all packed out people up and down the
[2:24:26] aisles and my people rejoice and i'm
[2:24:28] sure there was
[2:24:29] preachers saying yes yes we hid it
[2:24:31] tonight and brother bradham said you've
[2:24:33] done the worst thing you could have ever
[2:24:34] done
[2:24:36] he said you should have came the first
[2:24:37] time he said you needed me to call your
[2:24:40] name out and tell your name and your
[2:24:41] address and
[2:24:42] all of this then you came
[2:24:46] you know sometimes we have meetings like
[2:24:48] that and maybe one or three or something
[2:24:50] you know those are the ones that serious
[2:24:53] i don't know what the other two or three
[2:24:54] hundred got
[2:24:56] but we don't need a prophet to rebuke us
[2:24:58] tonight and say
[2:25:00] we should have done it the first time we
[2:25:02] should have done it when the word was
[2:25:03] going forth
[2:25:04] we should have responded if god dealt
[2:25:06] with your heart and you raised your hand
[2:25:07] or you stood or
[2:25:08] you had a need you said lord remember me
[2:25:11] don't be ashamed of that
[2:25:15] jesus is talking to you tonight saying
[2:25:18] lord remember me
[2:25:20] brother bradham walked into that place
[2:25:21] laid hands on her
[2:25:23] and i'm going to the end of the story
[2:25:25] and our musicians you can about just get
[2:25:26] ready to come
[2:25:27] and she's laying there crying and crying
[2:25:29] hat and raised off of the bed

[2:26:20] but now we've gone way past you know
[2:26:23] medical and natural health i'm only 35

[2:26:28] take me months to recover
[2:26:30] i'd need rehabilitation in my bones and
[2:26:33] muscles and everything do you know
[2:26:34] brother branham walked into that room
[2:26:36] prayed for this girl
[2:26:40] that poor little girl weighing not over
[2:26:42] 36 or 37 pounds a bunch of bones
[2:26:46] she couldn't have stood if she had to
[2:26:48] not
[2:26:49] only stood but she jumped to her feet
[2:26:51] screaming to the top of her voice
[2:26:54] people began to scream perfectly normal
[2:26:57] and well
[2:26:58] her mother fainted and the sister came
[2:27:00] running in she didn't know what to do
[2:27:02] screaming her father coming across the
[2:27:05] yard with a
[2:27:06] with a container of milk in his hand and
[2:27:09] he heard the piano playing
[2:27:10] and he ran into the house to find out
[2:27:12] what it was there was his daughter that
[2:27:14] had never moved from that bed
[2:27:17] for nine years and eight months
[2:27:19] [Applause]

[2:27:42] in a bed it's so
[2:27:44] dark send the faith to a fight to a
[2:27:46] mother
[2:27:47] send the faith to a prophet he didn't

[2:27:57] since seven
[2:27:58] seven o'clock just keep walking just

[2:45:29] there's something that each and every
[2:45:30] one of us is facing and he's struggling
[2:45:32] with
[2:45:34] and and just when i lift my hand and i
[2:45:36] say lord tonight
[2:45:37] be the night and not maybe just for you
