[11:32] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[11:34] had made me free from the law of sin and
[11:37] death for what the law could not do and
[11:40] that it was weak through the flesh God
[11:42] sending his own son in the likeness of
[11:44] sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin
[11:48] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[11:50] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[11:53] walk not after the flesh but after the

[1:42:47] voice is saying don't do
[1:42:52] that we love you brother Tom we'll ask
[1:42:55] sister Marilyn and brother Dave schurov
[1:42:58] to sing a song and I was told brother
[1:43:01] Dave has a song he wrote himself we'd
[1:43:04] love to hear that one
[1:43:06] too Hallelujah
[1:44:08] well it really uh it's really hard to
[1:44:10] stand up here without my sisters because
[1:44:13] knowing that we're all three here but uh
[1:44:16] Joan has uh bad case of laryngitis
[1:44:20] so and uh I consider my my voice the
[1:44:23] weakest of the three but uh you know it
[1:44:27] just this sort of is a window
[1:44:29] into um how I've written a lot of songs
[1:44:34] um that we've sung and it's usually in
[1:44:37] the trenches just plunking away at my
[1:44:41] guitar you know in in some trial or just
[1:44:45] or something that I've just seen in the
[1:44:48] message and uh then I would go over to
[1:44:52] like a lot of of times I lived away and
[1:44:55] we would go over and and get together
[1:44:56] with Linda and Joanne and start singing
[1:44:58] the song and all of a sudden it just
[1:45:01] became such a such a more beautiful song
[1:45:05] and before I didn't have the elone I
[1:45:08] didn't have the tenor and um just the
[1:45:11] instruments and um I just thought you
[1:45:16] know this is this is really how I did
[1:45:18] write a lot of the songs so um through
[1:45:21] the mistakes and what all but um you
[1:45:23] know I got thinking too how that uh when
[1:45:26] you're at home and you're in your own
[1:45:28] home church and a lot of times people
[1:45:30] don't know what you're going through and
[1:45:32] you're you know you're just really just
[1:45:34] in the trenches once again and yet I
[1:45:37] found when I come here and come to
[1:45:40] places that God brings all his children
[1:45:42] together from different places and all
[1:45:45] of a sudden it's like oh there's my elto
[1:45:48] and there's my tenor and you know you
[1:45:51] hear the the testimonies and the other
[1:45:53] you know problems and things that uh
[1:45:56] people are going through and your
[1:45:57] brothers and sisters and and all of a
[1:45:59] sudden you've
[1:46:00] got the bride you know Onward Christian
[1:46:04] Soldiers just marching together and so I
[1:46:08] just want to thank you for all the the
[1:46:10] um Fellowship that that we've had and
[1:46:12] the few one-on ones that we could
[1:46:16] share I hope I can do this

[2:03:18] heart I Praise You In This
[2:03:26] amen they said that brother Ben called
[2:03:28] you I said brother Ben knows I don't
[2:03:33] sing maybe they want me to sing that
[2:03:36] would bring an end to the
[2:03:38] singing for sure I'll tell you this
[2:03:42] weekend uh I think this is one of the
[2:03:45] best meetings we've ever
[2:03:47] had you know and I I think it's
[2:03:52] was what it was
[2:03:54] because there was
[2:03:57] Freedom amen and there's nothing more
[2:04:01] wonderful than to see God's children
[2:04:05] free and
[2:04:07] there's there's so much bondage in the
[2:04:11] land and so much
[2:04:14] fear and you know everybody trying to
[2:04:18] think that they have to get their
[2:04:20] Doctrine right and they have to get
[2:04:22] their teachings right and they have to
[2:04:25] understand this and understand that and
[2:04:29] and then you think of just how simple it
[2:04:31] was the prophet said if you have eternal
[2:04:34] life you always had eternal life and he
[2:04:37] said if you weren't with him there in
[2:04:40] the beginning you won't be there and you
[2:04:44] it just takes us out of the
[2:04:47] picture and I I I like being taken out
[2:04:50] of the picture
[2:04:52] you know
[2:04:54] uh I you know when I I I sit up here and
[2:04:58] and I I see the Lord move and everything
[2:05:02] and I I can hardly believe that this is
[2:05:08] me you know because I was always was
[2:05:12] really Bound by complexes and uh um you
[2:05:19] know just fear of being in front of
[2:05:22] people and being around people and in
[2:05:26] fact I've always had a little saying in
[2:05:28] my heart there won't be any people in
[2:05:30] heaven because we're going to have to be
[2:05:33] so different you know what I mean and
[2:05:36] and so uh what was so wonderful to me
[2:05:40] was to see so many
[2:05:43] people from so many different
[2:05:46] places and so many different backgrounds
[2:05:50] coming together and joining in love
[2:05:55] around God's
[2:05:57] word and and when it's all said and done
[2:06:01] it it's Heaven and Earth will pass away
[2:06:05] but my word will not pass away and and
[2:06:09] uh see people have hope and know that
[2:06:14] yesterday doesn't hold
[2:06:16] you yesterday is not your chain that you
[2:06:21] can leave those things which are behind
[2:06:23] behind and press for a higher
[2:06:26] calling and your
[2:06:30] history sometimes is very difficult to
[2:06:33] look at my history is very difficult to
[2:06:36] look at and if I look back I just have
[2:06:40] to remember one thing that there's a
[2:06:43] blood that has been shed for
[2:06:48] me that came down and washed my history
[2:06:53] away and I
[2:06:56] don't can't relive
[2:07:00] today but I can try to live tomorrow the
[2:07:03] best I can and if if my tomorrow isn't
[2:07:07] as good as I want it to be I'll put it
[2:07:10] under the blood and move on to the next
[2:07:13] day and I'll continually putting it
[2:07:15] under the blood and one day I'll meet
[2:07:18] him there because that's God's provided
[2:07:21] place place of worship is under the shed
[2:07:24] blood and so I I'm I'm grateful for this
[2:07:27] weekend brother Tom brother Mike we're
[2:07:30] just thankful for the word and the
[2:07:33] Liberty that you felt to preach your
[2:07:36] heart to us and remind us once again
[2:07:40] that we serve a God not just a God but
[2:07:45] the one and only true living Goden
[2:07:51] amen and he is
[2:07:53] God and that's just the way it
[2:07:56] is and so I'm going to sing a
[2:08:03] song oh you know better than that how
[2:08:05] long how long have you know me I have
[2:08:09] property to sell too you know what I
[2:08:13] mean no you're going to help me sing a
[2:08:17] song Amen and Matthew's Comm this is a
[2:08:20] song Matthew's than
[2:08:22] with the choir and you know I don't know
[2:08:24] they even know the name of the song I
[2:08:26] just know that he's God and that's just
[2:08:28] the way it is he's the only God
[2:08:31] right is that what we heard we heard a
[2:08:35] God that's present
[2:08:37] tense we heard a God that's got
[2:08:40] unspeakable and unlimited
[2:08:44] power and that's
[2:08:47] God and he's not a God that was created
[2:08:50] by human human
[2:08:53] hands he's not a God that's dependent on
[2:08:56] Mortal
[2:08:58] man he's not a God that's in need of
[2:09:03] anything that's his plan and that's just
[2:09:07] the way it is and when we go out from

[2:13:38] star you slipped a little wedding band
[2:13:41] of predestination on
[2:13:44] us and you declared that we would be
[2:13:48] your elect lady
[2:13:51] and we came from all walks of
[2:13:55] life we found ourselves
[2:13:57] in all kinds of treacherous
[2:14:03] situations we had wandered far from
[2:14:06] you and we were lost in a foreign
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:12] land but you came to seek
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:18] us you sought us out
[2:14:24] you spoke your word and
[2:14:26] your word was what we
[2:14:30] were and when you spoke there was
[2:14:33] something that came to life in us and we
[2:14:36] were
[2:14:38] resurrected and we traveled through our
[2:14:41] thoughts and through our minds trying to
[2:14:43] find you and one time and one day and
[2:14:47] one place each of us we came fac face to
[2:14:51] face with

[2:14:54] you and you welcomed us
[2:14:57] home you welcomed us into your
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:02] kingdom and many enemies have risen up
[2:15:05] against us and many voices have spoken
[2:15:09] to
[2:15:10] us but father we're here this evening to
[2:15:14] declare unto you that we have returned
[2:15:16] back to your

[2:15:46] under
[2:15:48] inspiration take form in their lives
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:54] father I ask that you be with lesie and
[2:15:59] I as
[2:16:03] we
[2:16:07] travel father it's been on my heart for
[2:16:11] years to have this meeting
[2:16:15] in Zambia
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:22] and I don't know what lies ahead
[2:16:26] father but I know that you per prepareth
[2:16:29] the path before
[2:16:31] me and you are a lamp under my
[2:16:35] feet and If I Could Just Surrender
[2:16:39] [Music]
[2:16:41] myself that they might know the God that
[2:16:44] was preached this weekend
[2:16:47] here is the creator of Heaven and Earth
[2:16:52] that they might find
[2:16:53] Hope and
[2:16:56] joy and that every bondage might be
[2:17:00] broken by the power of the
[2:17:03] Resurrection we ask that you would help
[2:17:05] us father bring
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:11] you and we ask that you go with
[2:17:15] us father you've raised up great men in
[2:17:18] this church to carry the flame
[2:17:22] and I'm so
[2:17:24] grateful may we ever be steadfast to
[2:17:27] stay with your
[2:17:29] word though many things
[2:17:32] pull may we know one thing my sheep hear
[2:17:35] my voice and another they will not
[2:17:40] follow bless us now we pray in Jesus
[2:17:44] precious name amen and amen I just like
[2:17:50] to share some something it's a little
[2:17:51] funny but they made a
[2:17:54] poster for the meetings I I didn't know
[2:17:57] they were going to do that so they made
[2:17:59] a big poster up there somehow they went
[2:18:03] in the archive and dug up a picture from
[2:18:05] about 25 years ago are they going to be
[2:18:09] shocked you know I'm all shaved you know
[2:18:12] what I mean and I'm standing there nice
[2:18:14] and young I'm
[2:18:16] skinny and they're going to get a fat
[2:18:19] old balded beard man
[2:18:21] show up but aren't you glad it's not the
[2:18:24] flesh that
[2:18:25] counts amen it's not the God on the
[2:18:28] outside it's the God on the
[2:18:30] inside amen so uh I I just thought that
[2:18:35] was strange well then they found out
[2:18:38] that I was getting in Tuesday so they
[2:18:40] said well man if he's coming in Tuesday
[2:18:43] let's have him preach Wednesday night so
[2:18:46] I can preach Wednesday night and then
[2:18:48] they probably will sneak in a Thursday
[2:18:51] but anyway I'm supposed to preach
[2:18:52] Wednesday night Friday
[2:18:55] night Saturday morning Saturday
[2:18:59] night Sunday morning and Sunday night
[2:19:03] now have any of you ever witnessed me
[2:19:05] preaching that many services in a
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:09] row but if you want to get up at 2 o00
[2:19:12] in the morning you can stream it I
[2:19:16] think but
[2:19:19] anyway they've been an
[2:19:22] expectation and remember when I go you
[2:19:28] go and when I go I'm taking you with me
[2:19:31] in my
[2:19:34] heart and
[2:19:36] so all I can say is I'm I Love The
[2:19:40] Gospel that the Lord Jesus has given
[2:19:43] us how can I say that I love his
[2:19:47] love I can't believe he picked me
[2:19:51] but I'm so happy he did so love one
[2:19:55] another's little children love one
[2:19:57] another he who saith he loves God and
[2:20:00] hates his brother is a liar forgive one
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:06] another be kind one to
[2:20:10] another and I believe we'll see a fruit
[2:20:13] that you can't
[2:20:14] imagine I believe the power of God's
[2:20:17] just fixing to strike the church if we
[2:20:20] stay in step we will see things that
[2:20:24] we've only thought were impossible God
[2:20:28] bless you go in peace thank you for your
[2:20:31] love thank you for your support take
[2:20:35] Jesus with you God bless you go in
[2:20:40] [Music]
[2:20:45] peace if you're
[2:20:48] walking through the V
[2:20:52] and no Shadows all
[2:20:57] around not
[2:21:00] fear he will guide
[2:21:03] you he will keep you safe
[2:21:08] and call his
[2:21:11] promise to never leave you don't forsake
[2:21:17] you and his word is true
