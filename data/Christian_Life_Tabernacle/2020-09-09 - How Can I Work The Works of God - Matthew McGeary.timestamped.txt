[21:28] is
[21:33] [Music]
[21:56] is
[21:58] praise the lord he's so good to us
[22:02] amen that might sound like a simple
[22:05] phrase
[22:06] there's just not enough phrases to
[22:08] describe them amen
[22:10] and praise the lord well i guess we're
[22:12] done
[22:14] all right praise the lord let's just
[22:16] turn in our bibles
[22:18] bro james it's good to see you i thought
[22:19] you were gone
[22:22] well that seems to be the theme lately
[22:28] praise the lord let's just turn in our
[22:29] bibles to john chapter six
[22:38] thankfully y'all could make it out to
[22:40] the house of the lord
[22:42] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[22:44] forever
[22:46] i believe we're looking to the unseen
[22:49] tonight john chapter six
[22:54] verse 26.
[23:14] so jesus answered them and said verily
[23:17] verily i say unto you
[23:20] you seek me not because you saw the
[23:22] miracles
[23:23] but because you did eat the loaves
[23:26] and were filled so this is uh when after
[23:31] jesus had multiplied the fishes and the
[23:33] loaves and then the disciples had
[23:34] crossed over and jesus had met them and
[23:36] the people
[23:37] went looking for him and they're they're
[23:40] they're saying we looking for you how
[23:43] did you get over here
[23:44] and jesus is saying unto them that uh
[23:48] you're not looking for me because of the
[23:50] miracles
[23:51] but because you did eat of the loaves
[23:54] and were filled
[23:56] jesus says in verse 27 he says labor not
[23:58] for the meat which perisheth
[24:00] but for the meat which endureth unto
[24:03] everlasting
[24:04] life which the son of man shall give
[24:06] unto you
[24:07] for him hath god the father sealed
[24:12] then said they unto him what shall we do
[24:16] that we might work the works of god
[24:19] and jesus answered and said unto them
[24:22] this is the work of god that you believe
[24:25] on him
[24:25] whom he hath sent heavenly father we
[24:28] just approach you now
[24:31] thanking you lord for your wonderful
[24:33] love and care
[24:35] we thank you for your word lord just
[24:36] pray that
[24:38] you would come now and you would just
[24:41] have your will and way in the service
[24:43] lord may we all just be in one mind and
[24:45] one accord
[24:46] lord we're the enemy we try to hinder in
[24:49] the name of jesus christ we bind the
[24:51] enemy lord that your
[24:53] holy spirit could just have preeminence
[24:55] lord your bride has gathered together
[24:58] lord and we have a divine promise that
[25:00] says where two or three are gathered
[25:02] in my name that you would be in our
[25:04] midst lord i'm reminded of
[25:06] the disciples on the road to emmaus
[25:09] though they were discouraged they were
[25:11] downtrodden maybe they hadn't
[25:13] seen what had been fulfilled in the word
[25:15] but yet even in that scenario lord
[25:17] you drew near father we know that you
[25:20] are drawing nigh unto us this evening
[25:23] so now lord jesus we surrender ourselves
[25:25] to you
[25:26] the speaker and they hear that you might
[25:28] have your perfect will and way in the
[25:29] service
[25:30] we ask these things in your name jesus
[25:32] christ
[25:33] amen amen you may have your seats
[25:38] and i just was something that struck me
[25:41] as i
[25:42] read this scripture it's
[25:46] where they say how can i work the works
[25:49] of god
[25:49] maybe that we're just rephrasing a
[25:51] little bit that's what i'd like to speak
[25:52] on
[25:53] a little bit is how can i work
[25:56] the works of god and i think that would
[25:59] be the desire
[26:00] of of every believer
[26:03] is to work the works of god you know we
[26:07] maybe when we think of the works of god
[26:09] we we
[26:10] think of the signs and the and the
[26:11] wonders and the miracles and
[26:13] you even think of of the setting of the
[26:16] scripture here
[26:17] and these uh disciples if you will these
[26:20] people that are following after jesus no
[26:22] doubt
[26:24] they've seen the signs and wonders
[26:26] they've seen the miracles and
[26:28] and they're coming to jesus and they're
[26:29] asking them hey what
[26:31] what can we do to work the works of god
[26:34] and
[26:35] maybe on their mind and maybe on our
[26:36] minds when we would think of the works
[26:38] of god we think of the dead being raised
[26:40] we
[26:40] maybe think of the the loaves and the
[26:42] fishes and we think of turning water
[26:45] into wine and the halt and the lame uh
[26:48] standing up and all those things are the
[26:50] works of god and i believe that's what's
[26:51] been promised
[26:53] to the believer in this day as the
[26:54] restoration has come forth with the word
[26:57] that these signs shall follow them that
[26:59] believe
[27:00] and just looking at that scripture as we
[27:02] would just
[27:03] take a little time this evening mark 16
[27:07] it says and he said unto them
[27:10] go ye into all the world and preach the
[27:12] gospel to every creature
[27:14] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[27:17] be saved
[27:18] but he that believeth not shall be
[27:20] damned
[27:21] and these signs shall follow them that
[27:23] believe
[27:25] now something that's very encouraging if
[27:28] you just want to look at the order of
[27:30] god's word
[27:31] is the first step is believing and these
[27:34] signs shall follow them that believe in
[27:37] my name
[27:38] shall they cast out devils they shall
[27:40] speak with new tongues
[27:42] they shall take up serpents and if they
[27:44] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[27:46] them
[27:47] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[27:49] they shall
[27:50] recover so these signs shall follow them
[27:54] that believe
[27:55] and what is he saying this is the work
[27:57] of god
[27:58] that you believe on him who he hath sent
[28:02] and i just want to maybe say in the
[28:04] outset that you know we've
[28:06] we also have been sent
[28:09] you know we believe on him that has been
[28:11] sent but once you've received the
[28:12] message
[28:13] then you're a bearer of the message but
[28:16] you find a lot of people are running
[28:18] without a message
[28:20] a lot of people are maybe just uh
[28:23] following because the the signs and the
[28:25] wonders or the miracles if you were to
[28:27] look at
[28:27] uh the ministry of william branham and
[28:30] and how many people had come for that
[28:32] first pull and that second pull and
[28:34] and no doubt is here uh jesus is letting
[28:37] these
[28:37] ones that are seeking after him no he's
[28:39] telling him look
[28:40] you you you really haven't even come
[28:43] because of the miracles
[28:44] but you're coming because of something
[28:47] that had
[28:47] satisfied you naturally and so many
[28:50] times people are following after a
[28:52] gospel or they're following after a word
[28:54] or they're going to a church
[28:55] because there's some type of natural
[28:58] stimulation
[28:59] or or something intellectually that they
[29:01] can wrap their mind around
[29:03] so they're following after that instead
[29:05] of for the right thing
[29:07] instead of for the pure word of god for
[29:09] the revelation
[29:10] that god would give to you by faith and
[29:12] that's what we want to have as believers
[29:14] is
[29:15] is we want to have a revelation of the
[29:16] word and we want to be following him
[29:18] after the word
[29:19] not just because of signs and miracles
[29:21] or wonders or because some dynamic
[29:23] ministry
[29:24] or even looking to the past and and
[29:27] following after
[29:28] the man william branham because of such
[29:30] a dynamic ministry but what did that
[29:31] dynamic ministry
[29:33] introduce and that's what we want to
[29:35] receive is that message and once you've
[29:37] received that message
[29:38] now you have an obligation just as as
[29:40] william branham the prophet the
[29:42] messenger to the age had an obligation
[29:44] under the call
[29:45] and under the ministry that god had
[29:47] given him was to preach
[29:48] this message and reveal the seven seals
[29:51] and the mystery
[29:51] and introduce the the bride to jesus
[29:54] christ
[29:55] he had a message but he has played his
[29:56] part now and he has gone on
[29:58] but now who who's carrying on that
[30:00] ministry
[30:02] it's the bride of jesus christ now we
[30:04] have that same responsibility
[30:06] to pack this message around the world
[30:08] and to preach the gospel that he's the
[30:10] same yesterday today and forever
[30:12] and we know that as we believe this word
[30:14] it says these times shall follow them
[30:16] that believe
[30:17] and i believe that the church now is
[30:19] coming to the time where we're coming
[30:21] into the unity
[30:22] and we're coming to the harmony that
[30:24] that has been being preached over this
[30:26] pulpit that we're
[30:26] we're starting to see another book of
[30:29] acts that's going to be written but we
[30:30] got to be an expectation
[30:32] we got to be willing to die out and lay
[30:34] everything down or we got to be an
[30:35] expectation
[30:36] and looking at our brothers and our
[30:38] sisters and looking at each one
[30:39] and believing in expectation that man
[30:42] this can happen any moment
[30:45] but we we have to have a revelation of
[30:47] the message we got to be running for a
[30:48] purpose
[30:49] i was just having some fellowship with
[30:51] brother james and we we got to looking
[30:53] into
[30:53] uh samuel and and looking at the time
[30:56] when
[30:57] when absalom you know he had betrayed
[30:58] his father david
[31:00] and and he was running and he got caught
[31:02] there in that oak tree and he was
[31:03] hanging
[31:04] there by his by his hair and and i
[31:06] believe it was
[31:07] uh was it joab i believe it was you know
[31:10] uh he told one of the the the servants
[31:13] to go slay him he said look there
[31:14] the king said no way i'm not going to
[31:18] touch a son because of the
[31:19] the king's word but he he was rough and
[31:22] he went and slayed him anyhow
[31:24] and yet when when joey went to send
[31:26] messengers
[31:28] he went to send messengers unto david to
[31:30] give him a report on how the battle had
[31:31] went
[31:32] there was one ahima's i believe it was
[31:34] that that was willing to run
[31:36] and he was close by and he had seen the
[31:38] commotion and
[31:39] he had kind of heard what had happened
[31:41] and so he felt comfortable
[31:43] in what knowledge that he had gained and
[31:45] so he was willing to run he was eager to
[31:48] do something for the lord and i believe
[31:50] that's a lot of times like we are where
[31:52] we're willing and eager and we want to
[31:53] do something for the lord but oh
[31:55] we need a divine revelation that we can
[31:57] come with that
[31:58] authority that no matter who comes in
[32:01] the way that as a christian
[32:02] we're in the line of duty that way if
[32:04] the satan would come
[32:05] oh we would know where we're standing
[32:07] that we could speak the word
[32:09] and have thus saith the lord because we
[32:11] know that we're in the line of duty just
[32:14] as joshua was able to stand there and
[32:16] tell the son
[32:16] stay still why because he was in the
[32:19] line of duty
[32:20] and i believe it behooves us as sons and
[32:22] daughters of god to have a great
[32:24] revelation
[32:25] and leading of the holy ghost to know
[32:27] that we're in the line of duty
[32:29] and hirohimas he was he was eager and
[32:32] willing to run and yet
[32:34] joab said unto him you're not going to
[32:35] bring tidings this day
[32:38] he said i'm not going to send you but
[32:40] yet he i believe he's
[32:41] told cushy to go ahead and run he said
[32:44] cushy go ahead and run and tell the king
[32:46] what you have seen
[32:48] and so cushy went off and he started
[32:51] running because
[32:52] he he had seen what had taken place he
[32:55] had a first-hand experience
[32:57] he had a revelation that he'd
[32:59] experienced for himself that he could go
[33:01] to the king
[33:02] and testify to him of what had happened
[33:06] but you know ahima's he was he was eager
[33:08] and he was wanting to do something and
[33:10] he kept
[33:11] he kept after a joab i believe it was
[33:14] and
[33:14] and was telling hey i want to run i want
[33:17] to do something too
[33:18] and so he finally said you know what go
[33:19] ahead and run
[33:21] so here he takes off running you know he
[33:23] was a better runner than cushy
[33:25] so he gets out there running and here i
[33:28] i just you know as you may be thinking
[33:30] of the story here's
[33:31] here's cushy he's received the order
[33:32] he's in the he's in the battle for the
[33:34] lord and here he's going and
[33:36] he's got his marching orders and here
[33:38] he's coming and he's feeling good he's
[33:40] in the line of duty and also in here
[33:41] comes this other guy
[33:44] goes right on by him i don't know if
[33:45] they exchanged words or said hey man
[33:48] you're a little too slow i'm going to
[33:50] get the message to the king
[33:52] before you you know it feels like that
[33:54] we maybe feel sometimes like that as
[33:56] believers
[33:56] you know you might feel like people are
[33:58] running on by you and and you seem like
[34:00] other people are being blessed and
[34:02] and you're just trying to do what you
[34:04] know in your heart to do and
[34:06] it's easy to be discouraged but you know
[34:09] the important thing is to keep doing
[34:10] that
[34:11] what you know god has called you to do
[34:14] and i i thought of that you know because
[34:16] she could have just given up
[34:18] he could have said you know what's the
[34:19] point in me running anymore
[34:21] you know he's faster than me he's well
[34:23] more equipped
[34:24] you know i maybe was call i received the
[34:26] order but this get this guy's he's
[34:28] better fit for the job
[34:30] and uh why would i continue running with
[34:32] all my effort and my
[34:34] when by the time i get through the kings
[34:35] can already heard the news and i have
[34:37] run in vain
[34:38] oh you're not running in vain church
[34:40] you're not running in and paying little
[34:42] bride
[34:43] i don't care whatever uh a work of the
[34:45] lord that he has given you
[34:48] oh it might seem small to you it might
[34:51] seem so
[34:51] simple but but but it's it's very
[34:54] important because you're part of the
[34:55] economy of god
[34:57] he's called you to that specific work
[35:00] and and know that you're in the line of
[35:02] duty of being a housewife or
[35:04] or just being a young man or a woman
[35:06] raising up
[35:07] under the headship of your mother and
[35:09] father look there's there's something
[35:11] that god is wanting to express
[35:13] in that season in your life whether
[35:15] you're young boys or young girls or or
[35:18] you're studying and you're in school or
[35:20] you're learning some type of trait or
[35:21] you're a young married couple or
[35:23] or you've been married for a while and
[35:25] and maybe now the kids are coming up
[35:27] every single portion of your life god
[35:30] has a specific
[35:31] interest in in in in manifesting his
[35:34] characters
[35:35] and his attributes and expressing the
[35:37] life of christ
[35:39] and so here here uh he makes it into the
[35:43] palace
[35:44] you know or he's running and i believe
[35:46] the watchman out there he's telling
[35:47] david oh here comes one running
[35:50] and it says it looks like it's the
[35:52] running of ahimas and
[35:54] and uh then they can as he gets a little
[35:56] closer they look off and here comes it
[35:58] there's another one running and i
[35:59] believe king david's like oh yes
[36:01] these are good men they're bringing good
[36:02] tidings so they come into the palace
[36:04] there and
[36:05] ahimas makes it there first and i
[36:08] thought of this you know here he comes
[36:10] into the presence of that great king
[36:12] warrior david
[36:14] and now he's going to bring testimony of
[36:16] the whereabouts of his son
[36:19] and you know he he felt good enough he
[36:22] felt good enough to tell joel hey let me
[36:24] run
[36:26] i saw what was going on but as he was
[36:28] there in the presence of
[36:30] of that king david and the king was
[36:32] asking i imagine there was a presence
[36:35] there
[36:35] you think there was a presence of god
[36:37] around king david
[36:38] oh he was the anointed of god
[36:41] and here he is he's he's speaking to the
[36:44] king and i imagine in that presence when
[36:45] he said hey
[36:46] what what what happened of it with my
[36:48] son
[36:50] i would imagine in the presence that a
[36:52] hemo started to think you know
[36:54] what i speak from this moment on my life
[36:56] could be dependent on it
[36:58] and he started to think maybe you know
[37:00] what
[37:02] i really didn't see with my own eyes
[37:04] what happened
[37:05] i really didn't experience it for myself
[37:07] but i i so-and-so had told me and i
[37:10] i kind of saw the great commotion over
[37:12] there and then i heard the people
[37:14] talking
[37:15] about what had happened and i remember i
[37:17] just i respected those people and i took
[37:20] what they said
[37:20] and and and you know what and now as
[37:23] he's going to give his answer to the
[37:25] king he goes well
[37:27] the truth of the truth of it is is i saw
[37:31] a great commotion
[37:33] you know i i i saw a great commotion and
[37:35] and i wonder if
[37:37] if maybe a lot of people or maybe
[37:38] somebody sitting here is
[37:40] is maybe the commotion around the
[37:42] message
[37:43] has caught your attention maybe you've
[37:46] looked into the signs and the wonders
[37:47] and it's it's so different
[37:49] you know many people that are conspiracy
[37:51] theorists you know they're attracted to
[37:52] things like this
[37:53] because they're so different and so far
[37:55] out of the norm it piques their
[37:57] interests and they start coming around
[38:01] but i wonder if maybe if we've grown up
[38:02] in the church
[38:04] and we've we've gone to the youth
[38:06] meetings and we've gone to the special
[38:08] services and
[38:08] and oh we've had experiences and
[38:10] commotions
[38:14] and we've we've become satisfied with
[38:17] with an experience
[38:19] and just waited until another experience
[38:22] but the prophet of god said that's that
[38:24] that's the problem
[38:25] is people are are are putting their hope
[38:28] and their trust into experiences but he
[38:30] said away with experiences
[38:32] we got to get back to the word what does
[38:34] the word say about it
[38:35] we must believe the word and mary hema
[38:39] is in the presence of the king he said
[38:40] you know
[38:43] i just saw the great commotion and i
[38:46] really don't
[38:47] know what happened and i wonder how many
[38:50] of us are getting by on second-hand
[38:51] revelation
[38:54] how many of us have chalked up the
[38:56] message and we can walk through it
[38:57] intellectually by secondhand revelation
[39:00] because we've heard great teachers
[39:01] we've heard great speakers we've heard a
[39:03] great uh people
[39:05] orientate the word of god a gifted men
[39:08] so gifted that they can make the word
[39:10] plain but oh do you realize
[39:12] we got to take that word we got to take
[39:15] it into prayer
[39:16] and we got to come into a place where
[39:18] it's revealed to you personally
[39:23] i say oh god i i want to know for myself
[39:26] i don't want a second ad revelation
[39:34] but that's the first step is believing
[39:42] this is the work of god that you believe
[39:44] on him
[39:45] whom he hath sent the first step is
[39:48] believing having faith in that word of
[39:50] promise
[39:51] but you know that's what paul said have
[39:55] you received the holy ghost since you
[39:56] believed
[39:59] i know it's a wednesday night many times
[40:02] we're preaching to the choir
[40:05] sometimes as maybe i i would lean more
[40:08] towards an evangelist you know
[40:10] you cast a gospel net and and
[40:13] praise god at least you get a lot of
[40:14] amens but you know
[40:16] i believe young to old the gospel is
[40:20] still the same
[40:21] have you received the holy ghost since
[40:23] you believed
[40:27] it's it's a sincere question
[40:30] and we need to start looking at the
[40:32] pattern of the word
[40:34] and we need to start looking at our
[40:36] lives and seeing if a resurrected
[40:39] jesus christ is living inside of me
[40:45] this is the time to be sober this is the
[40:48] time to be sincere
[40:51] is while you have the chance
[40:54] not why you're laid up in a hospital not
[40:56] when the squeeze is coming down
[40:59] but while we have a by god's grace a
[41:01] nice little building and we have
[41:02] believers of precious like faith
[41:05] look if you're in bondage why are you
[41:07] going to stay in bondage any longer
[41:09] tonight
[41:12] why because our pride holds us there
[41:16] you'll be in bondage to pornography
[41:18] you'll be in bondage to social media
[41:21] you'll lay there in bondage because
[41:23] pride doesn't want to let
[41:25] your brothers know that you're in
[41:27] bondage because you've been at it a
[41:29] little too long
[41:30] and your pride will get hurt
[41:34] cares about your pride
[41:37] i want to see a resurrected lord jesus
[41:40] amongst us
[41:41] i want to see the power of the holy
[41:43] ghost sweeping through the building
[41:45] i want to see loved ones come to jesus
[41:47] christ and be saved
[41:48] i want to be to see the sick healed
[41:54] i want to see these signs following them
[41:57] that believe
[41:58] but it was our pride holding back the
[42:01] holy ghost from moving in power and
[42:03] demonstration
[42:04] because we're too worried about our
[42:05] self-pride
[42:10] not living a sanctified life
[42:14] look why is it why is it when we get to
[42:17] the top of the mountain sort of so i
[42:18] know we go through valleys
[42:19] but why is it when we we go through
[42:22] rough patches and we we go through hard
[42:24] times and
[42:25] we fall down and and and because there's
[42:27] a predestinated seed that you're gonna
[42:29] get back
[42:30] up you'll always get back up
[42:33] and one day you'll you'll get up for the
[42:35] last time and you'll never go back down
[42:39] but why wouldn't you get back up and you
[42:41] start feeling good
[42:43] do you let off
[42:46] why do we allow that human nature
[42:49] why do why do we get lulled back to
[42:51] sleep to where we're feeling good we're
[42:53] we're feeling the presence
[42:54] does anybody know how it feels to where
[42:56] you could just enter right into prayer
[42:59] you just pick right up where you left
[43:01] off kind of like a love relationship
[43:04] you know you just pick right back up
[43:05] with god but has anybody ever
[43:09] drew back and you go to pray and it's
[43:12] just like man
[43:15] i feel like i can't even pray and you
[43:18] start to realize you know i need to make
[43:19] some things right lord forgive me i
[43:21] haven't been giving you the first place
[43:24] but i believe it's it's the time church
[43:27] where we come into those higher heights
[43:29] and we set our wings and we soar in the
[43:31] heavenlies in christ jesus
[43:32] and keep soaring but what do we do we go
[43:36] back to the daily routines
[43:38] instead of taking that fire and that
[43:40] sword in the
[43:41] and the realms of heaven back into our
[43:43] everyday living
[43:44] and continuing to overcome a possessing
[43:47] the gates of the enemy
[43:49] but then we get lulled back to sleep
[43:52] with with little time wasters
[43:55] oh we got to be redeeming the time
[43:58] but we want to see these same signs and
[44:01] these same wonders
[44:02] we want to see see this power and action
[44:05] in the church
[44:07] why not tonight have you received the
[44:10] holy ghost since you believed
[44:15] look you're a believer praise god
[44:18] that's a step in the right direction but
[44:21] the prophet
[44:22] said so many stop right there he said
[44:24] they stop at the water
[44:26] yeah you're a believer you've been
[44:28] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[44:32] but don't stop there
[44:36] this is the gospel this is the message
[44:39] i say we got to preach calvary like
[44:41] we've never preached it before
[44:43] all the blood is still more powerful
[44:45] than it's ever been
[44:48] he still heals he still delivers he
[44:51] still saves
[44:54] i think of when when i first started
[44:57] serving the lord
[44:59] i pray that oh i just know what it meant
[45:02] to me
[45:04] and i want to see the same thing that's
[45:05] what that's what sets you on fire for
[45:07] god
[45:09] you know you ever tasted something
[45:11] that's really good
[45:12] it's kind of funny you do the same thing
[45:14] with something bad i mean taste this
[45:17] but now you ever taste something really
[45:18] what's what do you want to do with
[45:19] something that tastes really good
[45:21] you want to share it you know like you
[45:23] almost want to share so man you're like
[45:25] oh man no you got to taste this i know
[45:26] there's only one left but
[45:27] you want somebody experience when you
[45:29] experience the grace and love of god
[45:31] you just got to share it with somebody
[45:34] and i wonder oh maybe why we're not
[45:37] sharing the gospel
[45:39] like we should be sharing the gospels
[45:40] because we haven't had the experience
[45:42] that we need
[45:44] we haven't come to the place of a
[45:46] born-again experience
[45:48] oh that house on fire you know like that
[45:51] little brook that brother branham would
[45:53] talk about he would come up to the
[45:54] little brook and say hey little brook
[45:56] little little spring old spring you know
[45:58] what makes you bubble
[46:01] is it is it become the deer come by is
[46:03] it is it because
[46:05] i come and drink he said no no it's not
[46:07] but it's something way
[46:09] down deep inside that just keeps pushing
[46:11] up and praise god when you've been
[46:13] filled
[46:14] with the holy ghost and the baptism of
[46:16] fire there is a well of spring
[46:18] water that's just springing forth from
[46:21] your soul that just keeps
[46:22] pushing you and and overwhelming you and
[46:25] pushing
[46:25] out and bringing you into his presence
[46:28] oh if you haven't had that experience
[46:31] oh you can have that experience not a
[46:34] one-time experience at some camp or
[46:37] or something but an experience where
[46:39] you've met him face to face
[46:42] and it changes you
[46:48] that's what jesus said in john 7 38 he
[46:51] said
[46:53] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[46:56] has said out of his belly shall flow
[46:59] rivers of living water
[47:03] oh that's a promise if you believe on
[47:06] him
[47:06] out of his belly shall flow rivers
[47:09] of living water you have something that
[47:12] you can impart
[47:14] you are now the bearer of the message
[47:17] you have the word of life you are now
[47:19] the carrier
[47:21] all that was in god he poured into
[47:23] christ and all that was in christ
[47:25] he poured into his bride that's you you
[47:28] are now carrying that very life of god
[47:30] and that very word of god to go out and
[47:32] quick and seeds to life
[47:35] he says in john 4 verse 10
[47:39] this is the setting at the woman at the
[47:41] well and
[47:43] says jesus answered and said unto her if
[47:45] thou knewest the gift of god
[47:48] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[47:52] to drink thou would us have asked of him
[47:55] and he would have given the living
[47:57] waters
[47:59] oh if you only knew the gift of god
[48:04] my if you only knew the gift of god if
[48:08] you only knew who was talking to you
[48:11] praise god she was about to find out
[48:14] that was the very purpose he came by
[48:16] by her way because jesus christ had come
[48:20] that he might quicken that predestinated
[48:23] seed to life
[48:25] only if oh if you only knew the gift of
[48:27] god
[48:29] you only knew malachi 4 5. you only knew
[48:32] luke 17
[48:33] 30. you only knew if you only knew
[48:35] revelations 10 1-7
[48:37] well not intellectually no not
[48:39] intellectually
[48:41] but if you knew the true gift of god
[48:44] in the revelation of what god has done
[48:46] in this day and realized that by
[48:48] divine promise that he has come once
[48:52] again
[48:53] jesus christ has been resurrected among
[48:55] us and just like the woman at the well
[48:57] this word this manifesto word by divine
[48:59] promise
[49:00] he has now come to quicken a mini-member
[49:02] bride to life
[49:04] oh that's what it says it says behold i
[49:06] will send you
[49:08] look they use the predestinated we got
[49:10] to take ownership of that
[49:12] what is it sent to do this is what the
[49:14] you know we just look at this and maybe
[49:16] laboring on this we're talking about how
[49:17] can i work the works of god
[49:20] so what does this message come to do
[49:24] we have to believe on the message on him
[49:26] that was sent
[49:29] that's how we work the works of god
[49:32] oh it sounds simple god hidden in
[49:33] simplicity
[49:35] oh what are you driving at matt well you
[49:37] know what
[49:41] i think we really need to dig in and
[49:43] start finding out what we really believe
[49:46] if you really knew the gift of god of
[49:48] what's been delivered
[49:50] well we only come so far we pat
[49:52] ourselves on the back
[49:54] i mean this word is too vast
[49:57] it's too deep it's too rich and if you
[50:00] fall in love with this message
[50:02] it'll take you places you've never
[50:04] dreamed
[50:05] oh and it it'll open up your soul into
[50:08] realms and
[50:09] and truths and bring you into such a
[50:11] harmony and love with jesus christ that
[50:14] oh the only thing you want to do is
[50:15] serve them the only thing you want to do
[50:17] is please them
[50:19] and the things of this world they just
[50:20] don't mean as much as they used to mean
[50:22] anymore
[50:23] and you start to you start to have a
[50:25] heart to put your brother first
[50:27] you have to have a start to have a heart
[50:29] to live for the people around you
[50:31] you start to understand what it means to
[50:34] be sincere and
[50:35] and by god's grace to have a little bit
[50:37] humility oh god teach us humility lord
[50:42] oh we we love the big uh uh uh the big
[50:45] cliche
[50:46] you know words and the big terms and
[50:48] everything and what makes us a a group
[50:51] and a big happy family but what about
[50:53] the down-home
[50:54] rugged living of just being jesus christ
[50:58] and getting below everybody else and
[51:00] just being humble
[51:01] and preferring your brother in humility
[51:05] and sweetness
[51:06] and sincerity
[51:10] you know even when people are wrong you
[51:12] you treat them right
[51:14] and and finding an ability even when you
[51:18] may not agree with somebody
[51:20] and and you're just in yourself you
[51:23] you're not wanting to give them any uh
[51:25] encouragement because you just don't
[51:28] agree with them
[51:30] but when you can completely die out to
[51:32] yourself
[51:33] and with a pure heart find something
[51:36] to lift them up and encourage them
[51:40] that's dying out to yourself that's
[51:42] being jesus christ
[51:43] you don't know what it is to live
[51:47] in their shoes you don't know what
[51:50] they're going through
[51:51] and we can be so judgmental but oh if we
[51:54] could have the life of christ to look
[51:56] beyond all the faults
[51:58] and all the failures and find a common
[52:00] ground and then and then maybe come in
[52:02] there and get under
[52:03] and lift them up and encourage them in
[52:05] the lord
[52:07] oh that's down home liver that's living
[52:09] the life of jesus christ
[52:12] working the works of god to your
[52:15] brothers and to your sisters
[52:20] this is the work of god that you believe
[52:22] on him whom he has sent
[52:24] and it's in believing this message that
[52:26] our hearts are turned back
[52:29] to that original faith
[52:32] we won't be much longer we'll just be
[52:35] really short tonight
[52:41] but i want to say that he's here
[52:44] to perform what he's promised
[52:48] maybe you feel like we've been believing
[52:49] a long time maybe you feel like we've
[52:52] been hearing the same things over and
[52:53] over and over
[52:56] maybe you're going through a season
[52:58] where
[53:01] maybe you just feel like you're not
[53:02] hearing anything new
[53:05] maybe you feel like when you come to
[53:07] church
[53:08] man they didn't say nothing
[53:12] nothing that i didn't already know
[53:16] well you know i think that
[53:21] maybe maybe you're the problem
[53:27] maybe i'm the problem maybe i've been
[53:31] holding up the show
[53:34] we're all in this together church
[53:40] and i'm i'm with all my heart i
[53:43] i want to see the supernatural
[53:49] are you willing to do whatever it takes
[53:53] to start laying down those little things
[53:55] in your life
[53:58] are we going to keep playing church
[54:01] we're going to keep packing around
[54:02] baggage
[54:04] and have brothers and sisters suffering
[54:07] with
[54:08] afflictions and carrying certain things
[54:12] do you realize that you could be the
[54:15] very catalyst
[54:17] that creates a revival in this church
[54:21] if you just get on your knees and you
[54:22] start getting into that atmosphere
[54:24] and you start getting in prayer and you
[54:26] start getting expectation
[54:28] and you let that fire be contagious oh
[54:31] if the church could get in that type of
[54:34] of spirit of prayer and expectation
[54:38] and believing for one another and
[54:39] wanting to see christ in you and christ
[54:41] in you
[54:42] looking beyond the faults and the
[54:44] failures and the indifferences and being
[54:46] an expectation
[54:47] for the fullness of the power of god to
[54:49] sweep into the building
[54:51] oh i believe we're coming into that
[54:53] church
[54:54] i believe there's something we're right
[54:56] at the door if thou canst believe
[54:58] all things are possible he's here to
[55:01] perform what he's promised
[55:04] but i think so many times we we question
[55:06] our own calling
[55:09] i love i love the statement brother
[55:10] branham says in christ the mystery of
[55:12] god revealed he says we got the devil's
[55:13] answer
[55:16] well you know i was reading through that
[55:18] and i said well
[55:19] what's the devil's question
[55:24] i don't know what questions he's asking
[55:26] you but i know a lot of questions he
[55:27] keeps posing to me
[55:31] but he wants you to question your
[55:33] calling
[55:34] he wants to question you to question
[55:36] your position in christ he wants you to
[55:38] question am i the bride he wants you to
[55:40] question all these things where you're
[55:42] at
[55:42] in this walk with jesus christ he wants
[55:44] to do it in such a way to discourage you
[55:48] but as we labor on this and look at it
[55:50] if
[55:51] how do you work the works of god you've
[55:52] got to believe on him whom he said
[55:54] believe what he said
[55:57] believe what he said and i as i thought
[56:00] about this as brother branham keeps
[56:01] going on says we got the
[56:03] devil's answer he starts talking about
[56:04] you're his vindication you're his
[56:06] victory
[56:07] you know when somebody does something
[56:10] you know you might ask him like hey why
[56:12] did why did you go over there and
[56:15] rearrange that over there look it looks
[56:17] like
[56:18] that's not going to work but you when
[56:20] you tell them you know this is why and
[56:22] then you see it working
[56:23] you you you see the justification or the
[56:26] reason they did it
[56:28] and if you look at the the whole bible
[56:30] story
[56:31] about a man named jesus christ and and
[56:34] coming and dying and laying down his
[56:35] life
[56:36] oh somebody would look at that and say
[56:38] man that's a story 2 000 years ago
[56:42] but you realize you're you're the
[56:44] vindication
[56:48] christ in you the hope of glory the very
[56:50] life of the messenger the very malachi 4
[56:53] 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 1 through 7.
[56:56] where's the vindication of it
[56:58] where is the vindication of it what was
[57:01] that given to do
[57:04] you oh brother brandon says christ in
[57:07] you is the revelation of the whole thing
[57:10] you're the very vindication of this
[57:12] message you're the very vindication of
[57:14] the bible you're the very vindication of
[57:16] christ
[57:16] that he's a living resurrected savior
[57:19] living here right amongst us
[57:20] oh we ought to be of such great
[57:22] expectation
[57:24] i was in fellowship with a brother and
[57:25] he he just
[57:27] uh uh for we we all know him
[57:30] uh just he was sharing us something that
[57:33] happened and
[57:34] he you know his wife has gone on to be
[57:36] with the lord and
[57:37] and he shared this i said brother that's
[57:39] just so inspiring to me
[57:42] and he said oh i had a dream the other
[57:44] night
[57:45] and he said in the dream my wife had
[57:46] come and and we were talking i believe
[57:48] she
[57:49] she said she she was just rubbing my
[57:52] faces and i was surprised you know
[57:54] because the resurrection was on i was
[57:57] surprised
[57:58] during the dream i knew the resurrection
[58:00] was on and i was surprised
[58:01] and she came there and touched on my
[58:03] face she's like and she said to me she
[58:05] goes
[58:07] are you surprised he said yes
[58:10] i'm surprised and she said well weren't
[58:13] you expecting it
[58:16] and the dream faded out and that spoke
[58:19] such
[58:19] depth to my heart what are we expecting
[58:22] church
[58:23] what are we looking for are we just
[58:25] pursuing after our educations and our
[58:28] jobs and
[58:29] and and paying our car note and our
[58:32] bills that
[58:32] all we're doing is expecting to get by
[58:35] all we're doing is expecting to pay the
[58:37] bills one more friday
[58:40] oh we fall into the same trap as the
[58:42] rest of the world
[58:44] but we receive such a powerful message
[58:47] we ought to be in such
[58:48] expectations oh the other day it wasn't
[58:52] too long ago my phone rang and it was it
[58:55] was brother mike mcclowsky and
[58:57] and i don't know i just i was just
[58:59] expecting him to say he's walking
[59:02] i just i don't know it's the first thing
[59:04] i thought i was like man
[59:06] are you walking because i'm expecting it
[59:10] i believe as we we we we die out to all
[59:13] the things of
[59:15] of the world and the church starts
[59:17] coming into a unity
[59:18] and a harmony that we're in such
[59:20] expectations
[59:22] for the supernatural that the devil
[59:24] doesn't even know what to do with us
[59:26] or the prophet said that you can live so
[59:29] close to god that the devil don't even
[59:30] know what to do with you
[59:32] if he said it i believe it i believe on
[59:36] the one whom he sent
[59:37] and that messenger spoke those words to
[59:39] me and by faith i say lord
[59:41] bring me into that place bring all of us
[59:44] into that place
[59:45] oh a mighty invincible army standing
[59:48] upon the word of god
[59:51] that we can stand there and challenge
[59:53] the devil
[59:55] look i have i have a divine commission
[59:57] of the lord to go into the world and
[59:58] preach the gospel
[1:00:01] and i believe by my faith that if you're
[1:00:03] sick
[1:00:04] we shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:00:06] shall recover
[1:00:08] that's not my words that's his words
[1:00:11] oh he's the same yesterday today and
[1:00:13] forever
[1:00:26] this is dangerous to pick up this book
[1:00:29] christ the mystery
[1:00:32] let me just read a statement
[1:00:49] 585 christ is risen
[1:00:53] and has paid the price for our
[1:00:54] redemption
[1:00:56] what god in christ manifested he gave
[1:00:58] that flesh
[1:01:00] that and blood that in the blood might
[1:01:02] come the life
[1:01:04] and the flesh be redeemed that god
[1:01:07] in this redeemed flesh could manifest
[1:01:10] his word for the day
[1:01:12] as he did in that day
[1:01:15] now we gotta we gotta take this personal
[1:01:19] he is speaking to you
[1:01:24] god in this redeemed flesh could
[1:01:26] manifest his word for the day
[1:01:29] as he did in that day glory
[1:01:32] you see it oh my when i can't stop
[1:01:35] notice
[1:01:36] then we stand justified in his presence
[1:01:38] of god
[1:01:39] as a drop of ink dropping into a tub
[1:01:42] full of bleach
[1:01:43] you'll never find the stain of ink no
[1:01:44] more it went somewhere it'll never come
[1:01:47] back again
[1:01:49] and when a man is truly redeemed that
[1:01:52] predestinated seed that sees
[1:01:54] it and accepts it his sins are
[1:01:57] demolished
[1:02:00] your sins are demolished
[1:02:04] look satan keeps trying to hold that
[1:02:05] fault over your head
[1:02:08] he keeps trying to hold you down he
[1:02:11] keeps trying to point to what you did
[1:02:12] maybe yesterday or one week ago or two
[1:02:14] weeks ago
[1:02:15] i want to tell you that by the blood of
[1:02:18] jesus christ if you have confessed your
[1:02:20] sins
[1:02:21] and you have made it right your sins are
[1:02:24] demolished oh we know sin will not have
[1:02:28] dominion over you
[1:02:30] you are justified he says it's gone it's
[1:02:32] separated it's dropped into the
[1:02:35] ink of the blood of jesus christ and
[1:02:37] it's never to be remembered
[1:02:40] god forgets it and he stands as a son
[1:02:43] and daughter of god in the presence of
[1:02:45] god
[1:02:45] amen and amen now we are the sons of god
[1:02:48] not will be
[1:02:49] not will be we are now we are redeemed
[1:02:53] we have satan's answer god has
[1:02:56] vindicated himself
[1:02:58] god has proved himself to his promise in
[1:03:01] this day hallelujah
[1:03:02] the headship is here
[1:03:05] who is here christ the headship the word
[1:03:09] is here i'm not looking for him to come
[1:03:12] he has come already
[1:03:14] and by divine promise he said he is here
[1:03:18] do you believe it
[1:03:21] amen christ the risen lord is here
[1:03:25] in the same power of his resurrection
[1:03:27] that he ever was
[1:03:28] manifesting himself there's the devil's
[1:03:30] answer
[1:03:31] oh my look at this that's the reason
[1:03:35] when this man sitting here dropped dead
[1:03:37] the other day sitting here we could say
[1:03:39] come back life because the holy spirit
[1:03:41] said so
[1:03:43] that's why it could do to that little
[1:03:45] baby yonder in mexico
[1:03:46] had been dead for about 15 hours when
[1:03:49] the vision come and said call it back
[1:03:51] call it back to life and said let the
[1:03:53] little baby live
[1:03:54] and the baby that the doctors wrote a
[1:03:56] statement died at nine o'clock that
[1:03:58] morning
[1:03:59] and 11 o'clock that night come back to
[1:04:01] life is living today
[1:04:02] what is it now this this wasn't
[1:04:06] manifested
[1:04:08] to be a story in history where we're
[1:04:12] always looking back now
[1:04:15] that's the curse of mankind we're always
[1:04:18] looking back
[1:04:20] and always looking forward and not
[1:04:22] seeing what he's doing right now
[1:04:25] but i believe that this now is it's
[1:04:28] being manifested
[1:04:29] right now if we can believe it we can
[1:04:32] have what we ask for he says what is it
[1:04:34] not them people the headship and the
[1:04:37] body has become one unit
[1:04:40] it's god's manifested it's god
[1:04:42] manifested in his people
[1:04:45] that's the reason the husband and wife
[1:04:47] is no longer trained they're one
[1:04:49] god and his church is one christ in you
[1:04:53] god's great revelation oh christ in you
[1:04:55] is god's great revelation
[1:04:57] glory to god even bearing his name
[1:05:00] his name is jesus the anointed
[1:05:04] what does that make you you're the
[1:05:06] anointed
[1:05:08] jesus said the spirit of the lord is
[1:05:10] upon me
[1:05:11] he was anointed to preach the gospel and
[1:05:14] the spirit of the lord is upon the bride
[1:05:17] you're anointed for the job you realize
[1:05:20] you're anointed for a body change
[1:05:22] do you realize you're anointed for these
[1:05:23] signs and wonders to follow
[1:05:27] we must believe the reason he is called
[1:05:30] jesus
[1:05:31] he is the anointed is the anointed body
[1:05:34] of christ
[1:05:35] proving manifested god like that body
[1:05:37] did
[1:05:38] and that body redeemed ever of this
[1:05:39] these bodies
[1:05:41] and through there god works his
[1:05:42] threefold manifestation going to the
[1:05:44] kingdom
[1:05:45] risen paid the price we're redeemed god
[1:05:48] has
[1:05:49] proved it vindicated where
[1:05:52] in you look it's
[1:05:55] it's not a vindication of a day gone by
[1:05:58] but it has to become something
[1:06:01] personally to you
[1:06:03] i don't want to be a hemas i don't want
[1:06:06] to be just
[1:06:06] running uh with a second-hand revelation
[1:06:12] but no when you've tasted it and you've
[1:06:14] seen it and you've experienced it
[1:06:17] i think of those disciples on the road
[1:06:18] to emmaus
[1:06:21] oh oh their eyes were withholden
[1:06:25] but jesus he drew near what did he start
[1:06:27] to do he started expounding them
[1:06:29] all the scriptures and it came to a
[1:06:32] place when he did something familiar
[1:06:35] oh praise the lord when he did something
[1:06:37] familiar and he broke
[1:06:39] the bread and their eyes came open
[1:06:44] that's that's what the prophet said what
[1:06:46] restores us back
[1:06:48] what is it the very message the very
[1:06:51] thing that we believe what restores us
[1:06:53] back to that same faith of the
[1:06:54] pentecostal fathers
[1:06:57] what is it
[1:07:01] the prophet said it's these divine
[1:07:03] revealed mystery truths
[1:07:06] it's it's those the revelation of those
[1:07:10] seven thunders that we're laying in
[1:07:13] those
[1:07:14] seven seals it's these divine mystery
[1:07:17] truths and the prophet there the church
[1:07:19] age book says literally
[1:07:22] that turn the hearts back we have
[1:07:25] everything that we have need of
[1:07:30] look if you can believe it you can have
[1:07:31] it
[1:07:33] we are now seated in heavenly places in
[1:07:36] jesus christ
[1:07:38] the only thing that would be holding us
[1:07:39] back is ourselves
[1:07:41] we just need to get out of god's way we
[1:07:44] just need to surrender to him
[1:07:46] we'll just ask the musicians to come we
[1:07:48] said we wouldn't be too long
[1:07:51] but maybe just in a simple thought
[1:07:56] what we're just wanting to encourage you
[1:07:58] is how can we work
[1:08:00] the works of god believe on him
[1:08:04] whom he has sent
[1:08:08] jesus said my meat is to do the will of
[1:08:10] him that sent me in to finish the work
[1:08:17] jesus said i don't do anything
[1:08:21] but what the father shows me to do
[1:08:24] now that's not a fancy saying that's not
[1:08:27] just some
[1:08:29] some uh a term for us to ponder and
[1:08:33] wonder but no
[1:08:34] he he's showing us something he's given
[1:08:37] us the example of how to live an
[1:08:39] overcoming life how to live a christian
[1:08:41] life
[1:08:41] what are we to do lord lord if if you
[1:08:44] said you didn't do anything
[1:08:45] but what the father chose you to do lord
[1:08:48] how can i do that
[1:08:49] how can i walk in that i
[1:08:53] i mean i don't have visions
[1:08:57] i'm not i'm not a prophet i
[1:09:00] i don't i don't got that kind of thus
[1:09:02] saith the lord i i i don't
[1:09:04] i don't understand lord you you tell me
[1:09:06] that you don't do nothing
[1:09:08] but what the father father uh shows you
[1:09:10] to do and
[1:09:11] and and i see the life of brother
[1:09:13] branham and i hear the supernatural
[1:09:15] things and
[1:09:16] and the audible voice and the angel of
[1:09:18] the lord standing there and and
[1:09:20] leading and turning you every which way
[1:09:21] but i'm just i'm just hearing lady'll
[1:09:23] see it trying to do my best to get by
[1:09:26] i don't understand lord how how can i
[1:09:29] follow you the same way that jesus
[1:09:31] christ was giving the example
[1:09:35] well praise god i got the answer because
[1:09:38] i believe on him who was sent
[1:09:40] he said right here this is the this
[1:09:44] harmony referring to john 5 19 that i do
[1:09:47] nothing but what the father shows
[1:09:50] he says this harmony now now
[1:09:54] let's let's believe this let's own this
[1:09:58] let's manifest this let's kick the devil
[1:10:01] out of here
[1:10:02] i'm not putting this off to tomorrow i'm
[1:10:05] not putting it off on the prophet but if
[1:10:07] he said it
[1:10:08] i believe it this harmony
[1:10:11] is now to exist between the groom and
[1:10:13] his bride
[1:10:15] he shows her his word of life
[1:10:19] she receives it she never doubts it
[1:10:23] therefore there is nothing can harm her
[1:10:26] not even death
[1:10:27] i was going to ask sister julia if she
[1:10:29] could play a song for us i
[1:10:31] really struck my heart and i just feel
[1:10:33] to maybe she'd just come and
[1:10:35] and prepare to do that uh just in my
[1:10:38] study today i was just overwhelmed by
[1:10:40] the love of god
[1:10:43] i think we ought to get back in a love
[1:10:44] relationship with him
[1:10:48] yes sir when you're in love with
[1:10:50] somebody you don't have to beg and prod
[1:10:52] them
[1:10:52] and ask them to call and
[1:10:56] find out where they're at but your very
[1:10:58] whole existence
[1:11:00] is just to be with him i say god forgive
[1:11:04] me
[1:11:06] for falling out of love with you if if
[1:11:08] that be where i am lord because
[1:11:10] you're worth all my time you're worth
[1:11:11] all my attention lord
[1:11:14] i think sometimes we maybe been in the
[1:11:16] battle a little while and we we get down
[1:11:18] the road a little bit
[1:11:21] maybe we need to rekindle that love a
[1:11:23] little bit more
[1:11:24] start thinking about calvary and that
[1:11:26] precious blood and
[1:11:27] what he did for us he says you could
[1:11:31] even
[1:11:32] lightly play that song this is he says
[1:11:35] therefore there's nothing can harm her
[1:11:38] not even death for if the seed be
[1:11:41] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:11:44] here is the secret of this you want to
[1:11:46] know the secret how can i live a life
[1:11:48] like jesus
[1:11:49] the word is in the bride as it was in
[1:11:52] mary
[1:11:53] how did it get there he put it there
[1:11:58] he was thinking of you before he even
[1:12:00] formed the stars
[1:12:01] [Music]
[1:12:02] placed the predestinated seed there the
[1:12:05] bride has the mind of christ for she
[1:12:07] knows what he wants done with the word
[1:12:10] she performs the command of the word in
[1:12:12] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[1:12:17] we have thus saith the lord we are going
[1:12:19] in a body change
[1:12:21] we have thus saith the lord we're going
[1:12:22] in the rapture we have thus saith the
[1:12:24] lord we can lay hands on the sick and
[1:12:26] they shall recover
[1:12:28] i'm tired of putting it off to the
[1:12:29] tomorrow i want it now
[1:12:32] why because that's what the prophet this
[1:12:35] is the very secret
[1:12:37] we're always looking back we're always
[1:12:38] looking forward but what was he trying
[1:12:40] to show as a resurrected savior jesus
[1:12:42] christ
[1:12:42] the same yesterday today and forever now
[1:12:47] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[1:12:49] and comes to pass like a seed that is
[1:12:51] planted and watered
[1:12:52] it comes to full harvest serving its
[1:12:54] purpose
[1:12:55] those in the bride do only his will no
[1:12:58] one can make them do otherwise
[1:13:00] they have thus saith the lord or they
[1:13:01] keep still
[1:13:03] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:13:05] doing the works
[1:13:07] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:13:09] complete all his work in his earthly
[1:13:11] ministry
[1:13:12] so now he works in and through the bride
[1:13:15] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:13:18] for him to do certain things that he
[1:13:20] must now do
[1:13:21] but he now will fulfill through the
[1:13:23] bride that work which he left for a
[1:13:25] specific time
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:42] oh my do you love them church was just
[1:13:46] in my office and
[1:13:49] just listening to the song that sister
[1:13:51] julia played
[1:13:53] i just started to become overwhelmed by
[1:13:57] by the love of god and looking at
[1:14:01] where i'd come from brother branham says
[1:14:03] in perfect faith he says
[1:14:04] and when we were sinners alienated
[1:14:06] without god
[1:14:08] in the world in that muck of mud as i
[1:14:11] talked about this morning god come to us
[1:14:14] god sought you you never saw god
[1:14:18] no man can come to me except the father
[1:14:20] draws them first
[1:14:22] and god came down in that muck what you
[1:14:25] were
[1:14:26] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:14:29] that ought to create a perfect
[1:14:31] love look what you was and look what you
[1:14:34] are what did that somebody that loves
[1:14:37] you
[1:14:38] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:14:40] promised you then
[1:14:42] real genuine love will create a
[1:14:44] confidence
[1:14:45] in his word he caught me when i was
[1:14:49] nothing
[1:14:50] i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand
[1:14:52] see
[1:14:53] he caught me and he loved me when i was
[1:14:56] unlovable
[1:14:57] he loved you when you was unlovable but
[1:14:59] he changed you
[1:15:00] just like the color sister said that
[1:15:02] time in her testimony she said
[1:15:04] i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what
[1:15:07] i want to be
[1:15:08] but i'm not what i used to be she knowed
[1:15:11] she had come somewhere something
[1:15:13] happened
[1:15:14] and that's the way it is if god when i
[1:15:16] was an alien from him
[1:15:18] so loved me till he stooped down to get
[1:15:20] me and pick me up
[1:15:22] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:15:24] to use me
[1:15:26] he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[1:15:28] something in me
[1:15:30] he's seen something in you he had a
[1:15:32] reason to save you
[1:15:34] look at the people that's unsaved today
[1:15:37] look at the millions he could have took
[1:15:39] beside you
[1:15:40] but he took you amen no one can take
[1:15:44] your place
[1:15:45] amen you're in god's economy
[1:15:48] no one can do it that's his love to you
[1:15:52] then won't you love won't your love
[1:15:54] reach right back to him
[1:15:56] and there's a love affair no matter what
[1:15:59] the situation is
[1:16:00] his circumstances is governed by this
[1:16:03] love that creates faith
[1:16:05] that god loves you and you love god
[1:16:08] and you love one another and that brings
[1:16:10] faith
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:13] then it can't keep from bringing out
[1:16:15] just
[1:16:16] exactly what god promised
[1:16:19] it would do how can i work the works of
[1:16:23] god
[1:16:24] just believe god and take him at his
[1:16:28] [Music]
