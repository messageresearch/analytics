[48:28] and the word of the Lord says
[48:31] this verily verily I say unto
[48:36] you that he that entereth not by the
[48:39] door into the sheep
[48:42] fold but climb it some other
[48:45] way the same is a thief and a
[48:49] robber but he that entered in by the
[48:53] door is The Shepherd of the Sheep
[48:57] to him the porter open
[49:00] openeth and the sheep hear his
[49:05] voice and he called his own Sheep by
[49:10] name and he leadth them
[49:15] out and when he putteth forth his own
[49:19] sheep he goeth before
[49:22] them and the Sheep follow him because
[49:28] for they know his
[49:31] voice and a stranger will they not
[49:35] follow but will flee from
[49:39] him for they know not the voice of
[49:42] strangers amen
[49:45] amen Lord I pray that you'd be able to
[49:48] bless your
[49:51] word Lord may we just be a vessel may we
[49:54] just be a channel that you would be able
[49:56] to come and P
[49:57] your anointing your oil for your people
[50:00] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:02] Christ amen
[50:04] amen you can have your
[50:15] seats
[50:20] um you had the best
[50:25] choice tonight you chose to be in the
[50:27] house of
[50:29] God where
[50:31] here you can find
[50:33] peace you can find
[50:37] Healing you can receive your answer to
[50:41] every question that you
[50:44] have because
[50:46] here is
[50:50] God and God presents himself through his
[50:53] word which was given
[50:57] just how we
[51:04] read and if I was to give a title or
[51:07] maybe a thought to this message that the
[51:09] Lord had put on my
[51:11] heart is recognizing the voice of
[51:15] God and obeying
[51:22] it it's very important this this thing
[51:27] we can hear the
[51:30] word we can hear a lot of voices that
[51:33] are around
[51:36] us because there's a lot of voices
[51:39] there's a lot of a lot of voices out
[51:40] there that
[51:43] talk and it was always like this from
[51:45] the
[51:48] beginning because the devil all he was
[51:50] able to do is to
[51:55] pervert and he was only there to pervert
[51:58] what God had
[52:00] [Music]
[52:03] created but right in the middle of this
[52:09] Darkness God always had his voice that
[52:12] was able to lead his own children
[52:21] amen he says because it's very hard to
[52:24] be able to read all the quotes that that
[52:25] I was able to to
[52:31] read within a few thoughts that I may
[52:34] have I'd like to play a portion of a
[52:41] tape that it's a voice that would be
[52:44] able to speak in these last
[52:49] days and the thoughts that I would I
[52:51] would want to bring to
[52:54] surface I would like to pay attention to
[52:57] how the voice of God was from the
[53:00] beginning that God had before the
[53:03] foundation of the
[53:04] world and it was a voice that was able
[53:07] to be transmitted until this
[53:09] day it was a
[53:14] line it was it was it was a line that
[53:17] that was able to go from the beginning
[53:19] to the
[53:22] end if we pay attention to the marvelous
[53:25] plan of
[53:27] God and vision and all that he
[53:32] created he had a blueprint he had a
[53:39] plan and within this plan there was able
[53:42] to be known all the
[53:46] conditions in which they were to
[53:50] function by the word of God
[53:59] all that God had as a
[54:02] plan he had his thoughts he had him in
[54:05] his plan that was before from the
[54:10] beginning which that plan needed to be
[54:12] put in function in a function and
[54:17] spoken in Genesis it says this
[54:26] the Genesis says that in the beginning
[54:28] the word the Earth was void and without
[54:32] form and over the face of the earth and
[54:35] the
[54:36] waters there was darkness and the spirit
[54:39] of the
[54:41] Lord was walking upon the surfaces of
[54:44] the water on top of the
[54:47] water and from that
[54:51] condition God starts beginning that the
[54:55] vision from the
[54:58] plan so so that way the the vision that
[55:02] he had that it would be able to be
[55:04] spoken it would be able to be
[55:07] given and that his word would be able to
[55:10] come into an
[55:13] existence and and the Lord
[55:16] said and let there be
[55:22] light he he divides the the light from
[55:26] the
[55:28] Darkness I would I would like to for you
[55:30] to pay attention to
[55:33] something even the
[55:38] nature recognize the voice of
[55:42] God obeyed the
[55:46] word and he was able that all that was
[55:51] moving at the at the word or at the
[55:54] thoughts of God
[55:56] the
[55:59] nature was able to recognize the voice
[56:02] of the
[56:04] Creator and it it was obeying it it
[56:07] submitted itself under that
[56:11] word because his
[56:15] voice was and will always remain
[56:21] forever the word of the Lord says that
[56:23] today if you hear his word
[56:26] don't Harden your
[56:29] heart and receive him in your
[56:33] life the waters he gathers them
[56:38] together the Earth is being able to be
[56:40] shown on the on the
[56:43] exterior the Earth to bring greenness or
[56:46] life uh
[56:51] grass every tree to bring a be able to
[56:54] bring fruit after its own
[56:58] kind and at after every after everything
[57:02] this is how it
[57:06] was right after the word that he was
[57:08] able to
[57:10] speak and
[57:11] then and then he creates the
[57:15] Angels
[57:17] the so then he creates the light he
[57:20] creates the
[57:22] sun the sun the moon the stars
[57:28] all of those start appearing at his word
[57:31] at his at his
[57:35] promise and then he starts creating all
[57:37] of the animals all of the living
[57:40] creatures all of the living
[57:45] creatures when all of those were
[57:51] created and the right conditions for
[57:53] them to live in
[57:56] how wonderful God do we
[58:00] have he created
[58:03] man you got you you understood the
[58:09] point God creates all the
[58:14] conditions all that he offers man to be
[58:18] able to
[58:20] survive and then he creates
[58:24] man to Rejoice or to be
[58:28] happy in the presence of
[58:32] God we have a wonderful God a great
[58:36] God the Lord created
[58:39] them and he gave them all the
[58:43] conditions all the
[58:46] power that was in Christ in the
[58:52] church just for us to be able to oby
[58:56] to be able to do the will of the
[58:59] Lord recognize the voice of
[59:02] God because World a lot of voices a lot
[59:06] of a lot of thoughts a lot of
[59:12] voices I was really surprised when
[59:14] brother Matthew had brought that that uh
[59:17] that message that was from uh the
[59:21] AI the voice
[59:23] that that that that speaks to
[59:26] the the voice of
[59:34] politics and when the question was asked
[59:36] what should I do to be able to serve you
[59:39] as the
[59:43] devil he responded very easily he said
[59:46] that I'll never convince you that
[59:47] there's not a
[59:51] God I will make you be the most occupied
[59:54] man in the world
[59:58] I will tell you that when you go through
[59:59] trials and
[1:00:01] tribulations Where's
[1:00:07] God there there's a lot of
[1:00:12] voices the most important is to listen
[1:00:15] to the voice of God because he
[1:00:18] said without a doubt I will not leave
[1:00:23] you even if a mother would be able to
[1:00:25] leave her child
[1:00:26] child I will never leave you I will
[1:00:30] never leave you I will be with you even
[1:00:33] in you until the end of the
[1:00:37] world this is God this is our
[1:00:40] God all we have to do is recognize his
[1:00:49] voice when everything was created even
[1:00:51] the conditions that were
[1:00:54] necessary and then he created
[1:01:03] nothing else that was able to complete
[1:01:06] or add to the world the world that God
[1:01:09] created the Lord said this is
[1:01:13] it he says grow
[1:01:19] multiply and have dominion over the
[1:01:21] world that have given
[1:01:23] you amen
[1:01:27] what a great God we
[1:01:30] have he created all
[1:01:36] things and then he brought man and gave
[1:01:38] all the creation to
[1:01:42] him he gave him the title he gave him
[1:01:44] the title
[1:01:46] deed
[1:01:49] amen
[1:01:50] she okay
[1:02:01] and for man to be able to accept to live
[1:02:04] in the presence of
[1:02:07] God God was meeting with God or Walking
[1:02:10] with God
[1:02:14] Adam and he was rejoicing of his voice
[1:02:18] and the presence of
[1:02:20] God think about
[1:02:23] it to be able to bring in the presence
[1:02:25] of God
[1:02:28] to be able to see the glory and his
[1:02:33] wonderfulness and every morning the cool
[1:02:36] of the
[1:02:38] evening to be able to have him speak to
[1:02:42] you it's
[1:02:48] wonderful and and he was meeting with
[1:02:50] Adam every day and was he was he was
[1:02:52] giving him his
[1:02:54] presence and and he was
[1:02:58] created the atmosphere to hear or to
[1:03:01] understand
[1:03:03] God and to be able to hear the voice of
[1:03:07] God but in in a certain day something
[1:03:11] happened he heard another
[1:03:17] voice I won't I won't get in there but I
[1:03:19] I'd like to have the prophet just say it
[1:03:27] and
[1:03:29] then is when man had fallen into
[1:03:35] sin and there is where now separation
[1:03:39] came away from
[1:03:41] God because
[1:03:44] sin a wall of division between God and
[1:03:49] man the
[1:03:53] sin even here the Lord
[1:03:58] even here the Lord had the vision and
[1:04:01] the condition of
[1:04:06] restoration in God there was a lot of
[1:04:08] attributes a lot of
[1:04:12] qualities that he wanted to reveal to
[1:04:16] his children to his to his
[1:04:19] people he was uh the uh Everlasting
[1:04:24] father almighty Everlasting
[1:04:26] father he was
[1:04:28] Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[1:04:33] shom all of these attributes that was
[1:04:35] inside of
[1:04:37] him was was needed to be revealed or
[1:04:40] shown unto
[1:04:43] man and he had the time the
[1:04:49] condition and the way that he needed
[1:04:54] to to be we
[1:04:59] brought and that's how God was able to
[1:05:02] be
[1:05:04] revealed and to be able to speak to
[1:05:08] man and to be able to reveal his
[1:05:14] plan and all that the attributes that
[1:05:17] was inside of him
[1:05:27] and and and in this Mo in this
[1:05:32] way God God is speaking to
[1:05:37] Noah I would like for you to pay
[1:05:39] attention and see how God
[1:05:46] speaks even within man where the seed of
[1:05:49] God was before the foundation of the
[1:05:52] world is able to obey or submit
[1:05:56] themselves to the
[1:05:58] word and the Lord speaks to
[1:06:01] Noah and he says
[1:06:03] this in uh
[1:06:06] Genesis uh Genesis chapter 5 six Genesis
[1:06:11] chapter 6
[1:06:13] 5-9 verses 5 through n
[1:06:25] and God saw that the wickedness of man
[1:06:28] was gray in the
[1:06:32] earth and every
[1:06:34] imagination of the thoughts of his
[1:06:39] heart was only evil
[1:06:44] continually and it repented the Lord
[1:06:55] Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[1:07:00] Lord Noah Noah was a righteous
[1:07:04] man and without
[1:07:08] spot from the ones from from the from
[1:07:11] his time or his
[1:07:15] generation Noah walked with
[1:07:20] God in that time in that
[1:07:23] age the the evil was so dark was so
[1:07:29] heavy all the thoughts or imaginations
[1:07:31] of man were always
[1:07:37] evil but within in the middle of this
[1:07:42] condition uh God had a
[1:07:46] man and he was he was holy he was
[1:07:49] righteous and he was walking with the
[1:07:54] Lord seat of
[1:07:57] God and when the
[1:07:59] word when when the word came to
[1:08:03] Noah he was able to recognize the voice
[1:08:06] of God amen
[1:08:15] amen uh in the age and and the condition
[1:08:19] or maybe the standard in in those days
[1:08:25] a man that would be walking with the
[1:08:32] Lord that God had this in mind or his
[1:08:37] vision from from from the beginning or
[1:08:40] from the from the beginning of the
[1:08:44] world God talks with
[1:08:48] Noah and Noah recognizes the voice of
[1:08:54] God and he gives them all the
[1:08:57] instructions that he has need
[1:09:00] of he created all of the conditions that
[1:09:03] were needed or that was
[1:09:07] necessary the Lord tells them to build
[1:09:09] an
[1:09:10] ark because he wants to destroy the
[1:09:13] world and all that's inside of
[1:09:17] it and who will hear the
[1:09:19] voice and would be able to enter
[1:09:22] in would be able to be saved
[1:09:26] the the the the
[1:09:36] choosing election amen amen
[1:09:40] election the election
[1:09:44] amen who would enter inside the
[1:09:48] ark would be
[1:09:50] saved the the election that's that's it
[1:09:54] amen
[1:09:57] who will receive the word of
[1:10:00] God and enters inside the
[1:10:03] ark they're
[1:10:06] saved this is the same thing that is
[1:10:08] happening
[1:10:10] today hears the message of the
[1:10:13] Lord enters
[1:10:15] inside which is the message which is the
[1:10:18] word of God is
[1:10:21] saved Al is is elected
[1:10:27] uh think about it for a second in a
[1:10:31] world where there was never known of
[1:10:34] what rain
[1:10:43] was brother brother bam says that that
[1:10:46] that you have to be an odd
[1:10:51] man sometimes you have to be so odd
[1:10:53] where the people
[1:10:59] sometimes you have to be so OD that that
[1:11:01] they would think they they wouldn't know
[1:11:02] what you mean but when you try to
[1:11:04] explain to them what you're trying to
[1:11:05] talk
[1:11:08] about for them there's not able to
[1:11:10] understand they're not able to to
[1:11:15] understand but Noah recognizing the word
[1:11:18] of
[1:11:20] God he knew that God would be able to
[1:11:23] hold to his promise
[1:11:26] regardless if there was never heard of
[1:11:28] such a thing as
[1:11:31] rain or maybe even the science about
[1:11:35] even the people of
[1:11:37] science it was it was contradicting
[1:11:41] them he knew that
[1:11:45] God will always stand behind his word
[1:11:49] amen
[1:11:56] God speaks to Mo
[1:11:59] Moses and he recognizes the voice of
[1:12:09] God he recognizes the voice of God Moses
[1:12:16] does and God confirms
[1:12:24] him would like to see how God works in
[1:12:26] strange ways or odd
[1:12:34] ways Moses was a really wise man he was
[1:12:38] he grew up as a child in Pharaoh's
[1:12:41] home but God didn't call him
[1:12:47] then he
[1:12:49] tried he tried to do something with his
[1:12:51] own abilities or his own ways
[1:12:55] but he
[1:13:01] fell and and then God took him from that
[1:13:04] place and took him into the Wilderness
[1:13:05] 40
[1:13:09] years and at the age of 80 years
[1:13:13] old God calls
[1:13:20] him and he calls him to the pillar of
[1:13:23] Fire
[1:13:25] the burning bush and it says take your
[1:13:28] shoes
[1:13:29] off because the the the place you are
[1:13:32] standing
[1:13:34] on is
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:37] Holy recognize in other words
[1:13:41] it be you uh Own It Be Yourself be
[1:13:51] you when Moses at that time recognized
[1:13:54] the voice of God
[1:13:57] God always will
[1:14:00] confirm the calling or his
[1:14:05] calling and the Lord told them what do
[1:14:08] you have in your
[1:14:10] hand and he says a
[1:14:13] stick he says throw it
[1:14:17] down and it transformed into a
[1:14:20] serpent as his spr of the Quad he says
[1:14:23] pick it up by the tail
[1:14:26] he he picked it up and took it
[1:14:28] up and it transformed right back into
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:31] stick the
[1:14:34] confirmation because the Lord called him
[1:14:37] and was able to stand behind the word
[1:14:40] also confirmed or
[1:14:44] demonstrated that God will always stand
[1:14:46] behind his word
[1:14:55] when God
[1:14:57] speaks he will always
[1:15:00] confirm and he will always to be able to
[1:15:04] stand before his word so it gets
[1:15:08] fulfilled and God is asking
[1:15:12] Jeremiah he says what do you see
[1:15:16] Jeremiah he says I see
[1:15:19] a a watch a
[1:15:22] Watchman amen
[1:15:25] he says what do you see
[1:15:27] Jeremiah he says I see a
[1:15:29] Watchman he says you surely see
[1:15:34] good because I watch over the word to be
[1:15:38] able to be
[1:15:43] fulfilled the Lord speaks to
[1:15:49] Samuel the the word says that in those
[1:15:52] days the word was really was very
[1:16:00] rare the Lord speaks to Samuel it tells
[1:16:04] him and the word of the Lord says that
[1:16:08] always the word of God comes to the
[1:16:11] prophet and Samuel was a
[1:16:15] prophet and I won't I won't get in that
[1:16:18] either but I'll just let the prophet
[1:16:20] said the Lord speaks to
[1:16:23] Saul recognizes the
[1:16:26] voice and from a religious
[1:16:31] man he transform his life
[1:16:34] completely into a new man and a new
[1:16:44] nature he was a man full of
[1:16:51] zeal he was a man that was ready to
[1:16:53] fight for whatever he was
[1:16:56] believing but one
[1:17:00] day Jesus stood before
[1:17:04] him the pillar of fire and he said he
[1:17:08] said sa
[1:17:09] sa why are you persecuting
[1:17:13] me and he recognized the voice and he
[1:17:17] says who are you
[1:17:19] Lord I am Jesus the one that you crucify
[1:17:27] and when the man recognizes the
[1:17:32] voice able to to submit himself or obey
[1:17:37] it you can know all the
[1:17:40] law you can see all the
[1:17:43] quotes you can see all the message from
[1:17:46] the beginning to the
[1:17:48] end when God
[1:17:53] speaks and when the Pillar of Fire comes
[1:17:56] upon your experience or your
[1:17:59] life your life is changed you become a
[1:18:03] new
[1:18:04] man become a new nature of
[1:18:07] God you become a man after the image of
[1:18:10] of
[1:18:12] God you die to
[1:18:17] sin you are man that's born after the
[1:18:21] the image of God
[1:18:26] every one of
[1:18:29] us needs to be able to stand before
[1:18:33] God be able to have that that personal
[1:18:37] meeting or relationship with
[1:18:49] God and God himself speaks through his
[1:18:53] son Jesus Christ
[1:18:57] which came to be able to restore all
[1:18:59] that was
[1:19:01] lost and it was
[1:19:08] perverted all that was to that moment
[1:19:10] was
[1:19:12] perverted and was not able to give life
[1:19:25] coming and and the motive for his
[1:19:29] coming was to be able to choose a a a
[1:19:32] clean
[1:19:34] bride and to be able to be washed in the
[1:19:37] blood of Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ and to be able to pay the debt of
[1:19:45] sin that was able that was oppressing
[1:19:48] upon the the the world or upon the
[1:19:51] people as a matter of fact
[1:19:56] God in
[1:19:58] flesh reconciling the world to
[1:20:01] himself for through the
[1:20:06] cross because because the the the
[1:20:09] payment for of sin is
[1:20:18] death we we want to come closer to our
[1:20:21] days
[1:20:26] chaos and within the within the
[1:20:31] chaos prop says that with in the days
[1:20:34] that we are living
[1:20:37] in is the
[1:20:40] darkest or is the darkest or more most
[1:20:42] chaotic uh age or or time that we're
[1:20:45] living
[1:20:49] in there's a lot of voices
[1:20:54] op there is a lot of op
[1:20:58] opinions and the prophet
[1:21:05] says he says that the voice of politics
[1:21:08] actually has more power uh is heard more
[1:21:13] than the voice of
[1:21:18] God the the the voice of science
[1:21:25] it has a certain
[1:21:27] interpretation or or an
[1:21:31] influence upon the
[1:21:36] world and says that here in United
[1:21:39] States of America
[1:21:41] Hollywood has another
[1:21:46] voice and in the middle of this
[1:21:51] house in in the middle of all of this
[1:21:54] Darkness
[1:21:56] God speaks to a
[1:22:03] prophet and the Lord speaks to the
[1:22:06] prophet of this
[1:22:08] generation is able to reveal all the
[1:22:13] Mysteries that was hidden before the
[1:22:16] foundation of the
[1:22:18] world because the Lord told John in in
[1:22:22] the uh Patmos or island of
[1:22:26] patmas it says there's
[1:22:30] no until the end time he says don't
[1:22:33] write until the end
[1:22:38] time today there's a lot of
[1:22:42] voices and people are confused or don't
[1:22:45] know what to listen to
[1:22:47] anymore uh confusion
[1:22:53] appears they start becoming more lovers
[1:22:55] of
[1:22:58] themselves instead of lovers of
[1:23:02] God they they search more for the
[1:23:05] satisfaction of of of this
[1:23:10] world in the middle of confusion or the
[1:23:14] darkness the voice of God screams and
[1:23:19] says whosoever heared my voice
[1:23:24] follow
[1:23:25] me and don't Harden your
[1:23:28] heart recogn in all your
[1:23:34] ways this voice that is continuing to
[1:23:39] scream is is is is the voice of the end
[1:23:44] time when all the elected
[1:23:48] ones needs to come to the Statue of a
[1:23:51] perfect
[1:23:53] man the uh a a mature Man in
[1:23:57] Christ is the only
[1:24:03] voice that prepares a bride for a
[1:24:15] Rapture if if they can maybe get
[1:24:19] ready I would like for you to cat to
[1:24:22] understand for me this message
[1:24:27] within the last three four months he he
[1:24:30] really dealt with me my
[1:24:33] heart and within the Deep portions of my
[1:24:43] heart gold to be able to recognize the
[1:24:46] voice of God in this
[1:24:51] generation if they can play if they can
[1:24:53] play that portion of tipe now and then
[1:24:54] we'll we'll finish
[1:25:07] up the church world don't know what to
[1:25:10] do the political world is in chaos
[1:25:14] everything seems to be in
[1:25:16] chaos fellas run from here something
[1:25:19] else rise up some jacket some coat when
[1:25:23] I was in Rome they got 19 different
[1:25:27] Vindicated nails that was drove in Jesus
[1:25:34] hand and there's only
[1:25:37] three but yet they've got the record at
[1:25:39] 19 different Nails Now what difference
[1:25:43] does it make who has a
[1:25:45] nail Christ never left US
[1:25:48] Nails To
[1:25:50] Worship he left us the Holy Spirit am by
[1:25:55] his
[1:25:58] word these signs shall follow them it
[1:26:01] believe they'll have the original
[1:26:03] nail they'll have these signs shall
[1:26:06] follow them at believe they'll belong to
[1:26:08] the denomination I started he started
[1:26:11] n see how the voice is
[1:26:15] contrary but these signs shall follow
[1:26:18] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:26:20] cast out Devils there's the word they
[1:26:24] shall speak with new
[1:26:26] tongues take up serpents that would not
[1:26:28] harm them they drink deadly things that
[1:26:30] would not bother them if they lay their
[1:26:32] hands on the sick they shall
[1:26:34] recover and you watch these things plus
[1:26:38] all the rest of the scripture put
[1:26:41] together now that alone will not confirm
[1:26:45] it not at
[1:26:48] all there where we Pentecostals get on
[1:26:51] the wrong
[1:26:52] road did not Jesus Jesus say many will
[1:26:55] come to me in that day and say Lord have
[1:26:57] not I done Mighty things in your name
[1:27:01] have not I prophesied in your name have
[1:27:04] not I done all this in your name and
[1:27:06] Jesus said depart from me you that work
[1:27:11] iniquity I never knew
[1:27:14] you do you see my sisters and my
[1:27:18] brothers why I'm so condemning and
[1:27:22] indicting this generation
[1:27:28] you might speak with tongue like man and
[1:27:30] Angels you might dance in the spirit all
[1:27:32] around the church that has nothing to do
[1:27:35] with it I've seen mohammad's dance
[1:27:38] around like that I've heard in the
[1:27:40] doctor witch doctor's Camp seen the
[1:27:42] witches stand up and speak in tongues
[1:27:44] and interpret it and tell exactly what
[1:27:46] was going to happen and it happened that
[1:27:50] way I seen even a pencil raise up and
[1:27:53] write in unknown tongues only one there
[1:27:55] could read it and was it the devil right
[1:28:01] you can't base your Eternal destination
[1:28:04] up on some
[1:28:06] sensation Satan can't impersonate any of
[1:28:09] those
[1:28:11] Sensations not it's to know
[1:28:18] Christ something changes in your
[1:28:21] life watch your life and pattern with
[1:28:24] the word and see where you're at taking
[1:28:27] inventory
[1:28:29] certainly in spite of all this
[1:28:33] impersonations false voices false
[1:28:36] prophets all these other things that's
[1:28:38] rising up Jesus still said in spite of
[1:28:42] all of this if any
[1:28:45] man would hear my
[1:28:49] voice and follow after me he is the word
[1:28:58] listen to his commission to us today and
[1:29:01] all these voices which I said it would
[1:29:03] take hours to bring out all these voices
[1:29:07] and it's confusing to the people it's a
[1:29:09] pathetic
[1:29:11] thing and after all you don't get the
[1:29:14] second chance you got to take it
[1:29:17] now you might not get a chance tonight
[1:29:21] you might not get a chance
[1:29:22] tomorrow it's
[1:29:25] now when you hear my voice Harden not
[1:29:28] your heart as in the days of
[1:29:31] provocation now is the time this is
[1:29:34] acceptable
[1:29:35] time that if any man will hear my voice
[1:29:39] that goes to show that his voice would
[1:29:42] still be there in the midst of all the
[1:29:45] chaos he still got a
[1:29:52] voice why
[1:29:54] his voice will ever remain here it
[1:29:59] is heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:30:02] my voice shall not pass
[1:30:04] away his
[1:30:08] word let's just take say another five
[1:30:11] minutes
[1:30:13] quickly can you will you stay that long
[1:30:16] a few minutes I I'll
[1:30:18] hurry let's just take some who heard
[1:30:21] this voice and obeyed it
[1:30:25] how it made them act what it made them
[1:30:28] to do I'm going to bypass a lot of of
[1:30:31] scripture here just in order to get the
[1:30:33] right straight to you how it changed
[1:30:36] their
[1:30:38] lives and all them that was about them
[1:30:41] how they become the
[1:30:44] Oddball we call an
[1:30:47] oddball every man that ever did believe
[1:30:50] God was considered an oddball
[1:30:55] because if you're in the trend of the
[1:30:57] world there's something wrong with
[1:31:00] you to be a Christian you have to be an
[1:31:03] oddball for all that live Godly in
[1:31:06] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions
[1:31:09] of the
[1:31:10] world he was in the world the world was
[1:31:12] made by him and the world knew him
[1:31:16] not quickly now listen close to as we
[1:31:20] close Adam heard his voice
[1:31:24] in the cool of the evening and had
[1:31:27] fellowship with
[1:31:29] him there was no condemnation to
[1:31:33] Adam he heard the voice of God he said
[1:31:38] father now I lay me down to
[1:31:43] sleep and he laid down and Eve on his
[1:31:46] arm the line the tiger and the wild
[1:31:49] beast laid right around him there's no
[1:31:52] harm no way of getting
[1:31:54] sick no way of wondering if they wake up
[1:31:57] in the morning they're going to wake
[1:32:00] up Adam heard his voice in the way that
[1:32:04] he ought to have heard it but one day he
[1:32:07] heard his wife's
[1:32:11] voice I better leave that alone for a
[1:32:18] while but he listened to the wrong voice
[1:32:22] yet it was his wife
[1:32:24] life the closest tie had on
[1:32:30] Earth why didn't he like job thou
[1:32:32] speakest like a foolish
[1:32:36] woman if it would the whole human race
[1:32:39] would be living instead of
[1:32:41] dying it changed the course of human
[1:32:44] beings in time but he heard a voice of
[1:32:47] God he had fellowship with it but when
[1:32:49] he turned how did he know that his wife
[1:32:52] was wrong
[1:32:55] remember it was
[1:32:57] pleasant we think today that our
[1:32:59] organization
[1:33:00] church we think that our prosperity
[1:33:03] today is God smiling upon us it looks
[1:33:09] good it looked good when Micah stood
[1:33:12] there before the 400 prophets and the
[1:33:15] whole land belonged to him and the
[1:33:16] Philistines was on it or the syrians it
[1:33:20] looked good these prophets is telling go
[1:33:22] out there that belongs to us take
[1:33:25] it but it wasn't the voice of God Micah
[1:33:29] turned around and cursed the
[1:33:31] voice and how did he know to do that
[1:33:34] because his vision was exactly with the
[1:33:37] word that's the only way to trust it and
[1:33:39] see it today it's got to be on the
[1:33:45] word then did you notice after Adam
[1:33:49] listened to another Voice besides God's
[1:33:52] voice his own
[1:33:56] wife and the church is listening to the
[1:33:58] voice of her
[1:34:01] organization injecting into them
[1:34:04] Creeds instead of the word letting him
[1:34:08] live any way they want to as long as
[1:34:10] they go to church and a member of a
[1:34:12] certain
[1:34:13] church that's all
[1:34:17] matters closest connection that the
[1:34:19] believer has on Earth to them is the
[1:34:23] church
[1:34:24] CH but the believer the real believer
[1:34:27] the closest connection is the Holy
[1:34:29] Spirit and God's
[1:34:33] word so you find out that Adam realized
[1:34:37] his condition and he heard the voice of
[1:34:40] God calling
[1:34:42] again and he was in
[1:34:46] bigle but it was a voice of
[1:34:48] condemnation why have you done this
[1:34:54] I wonder if America today or the world
[1:34:58] in its religious uh uproar as it is in
[1:35:03] America swallow being swallowed up it'll
[1:35:07] be a national religion pretty
[1:35:11] soon who's setting before me I know it's
[1:35:14] tapes and it'll go all over the world we
[1:35:17] have Tape programs that every message
[1:35:18] takes the whole world in all other
[1:35:21] countries
[1:35:23] but if you'll look and see they're
[1:35:26] standing in fig leaves when the true
[1:35:28] voice of God comes out they don't know
[1:35:30] what to do about it it's
[1:35:33] confusing they don't know what to do
[1:35:36] quickly Noah heard the voice of
[1:35:40] God he was preparing to save his
[1:35:44] life and he followed the instructions
[1:35:48] and he stood if a man hears the voice
[1:35:51] now listen
[1:35:56] gets this real good don't
[1:36:00] fail if a man hears the voice of
[1:36:04] something and if it's proven to be the
[1:36:07] voice of God and on time and then that
[1:36:11] proceeds forth from the man heavens and
[1:36:14] earth will pass away but that word can't
[1:36:16] pass
[1:36:18] away Noah heard the voice and condemned
[1:36:22] the world
[1:36:25] and they laughed in his face because his
[1:36:28] his message didn't cope with their
[1:36:31] scientific achievements but it rained
[1:36:34] and destroyed the whole
[1:36:36] world his voice that went forth the seed
[1:36:39] was laying there every age it's been the
[1:36:42] same
[1:36:43] way Samuel
[1:36:46] alarmed when he heard the voice of God
[1:36:49] that he was go Hadad to condemn Eli the
[1:36:53] man that had nurtured
[1:36:55] him the man that had been a daddy to him
[1:37:00] and had raised him up and
[1:37:02] fatty Minister
[1:37:07] Brothers
[1:37:10] sha ministers many
[1:37:13] times upon their denominational grounds
[1:37:16] and Creeds their credentials in their
[1:37:19] pocket of the very
[1:37:22] happy the very organization that's
[1:37:25] nourished them and fed them and brought
[1:37:27] them up and position put them in church
[1:37:29] and put them in a congregation you have
[1:37:32] to knck down to what they
[1:37:36] teach see what a horrible thing it would
[1:37:40] be for a true servant of God to hear the
[1:37:43] voice of God and have to come back to
[1:37:45] that same mother
[1:37:47] organization say you're condemned
[1:37:50] because you don't receive this word
[1:37:54] what a thing it was hard for
[1:37:56] Samuel but he was a prophet he had to do
[1:38:00] it regardless of where heard or not he
[1:38:02] had to do it
[1:38:04] anyhow
[1:38:06] Moses heard the voice of God he was full
[1:38:09] of theology he know all the ins and outs
[1:38:13] but it failed he heard the voice of God
[1:38:16] Moses was never the same and no man is
[1:38:20] never the same you might hear in your
[1:38:26] ears the the voice speaking but when you
[1:38:29] hear in your heart that's it the voice
[1:38:35] speaking then you're hearing you do not
[1:38:38] see with your
[1:38:40] eyes you look with your eye you see with
[1:38:44] your heart you see something say I just
[1:38:46] don't see it you mean you don't
[1:38:48] understand
[1:38:49] it you do not hear with your
[1:38:52] ears you you hear with your heart many
[1:38:55] times your ears hears the true voice of
[1:38:57] God and it falls off you like water off
[1:38:59] of a duck's
[1:39:00] bag but when you really hear you hear
[1:39:04] with your
[1:39:05] heart and all the theology that Moses
[1:39:08] had he hadn't heard the voice of God but
[1:39:11] one day God called this 80y old sheep
[1:39:16] herder over to one side and spoke to him
[1:39:19] and he caught it
[1:39:23] he proved it he was God first thing he
[1:39:26] done to Moses is vindicate his word I'm
[1:39:29] going down I remember what I
[1:39:32] promised and this is what he promised
[1:39:34] for the last
[1:39:36] days
[1:39:37] amen it raise up a people from the
[1:39:41] Gentiles all the promises this I
[1:39:43] promised said
[1:39:45] Moses take off your shoes in other words
[1:39:48] honor it now throw down your staff and a
[1:39:51] a dry stick off the desert became a
[1:39:55] serpent and Moses caught it and went
[1:39:58] back to its condition again see he knew
[1:40:02] that was God because God said the word
[1:40:05] of God the word that he was speaking
[1:40:08] said so down the stick in your hand
[1:40:12] that's God's
[1:40:13] word don't try to do the same thing that
[1:40:16] ain't God's word to you that's God's
[1:40:17] word to Moses here's God's word to
[1:40:20] you throw down the stick it turned to a
[1:40:24] serpent then now you're afraid of it
[1:40:26] pick it up by the tail back at went
[1:40:30] again God's word to him what did he do
[1:40:33] God Vindicated his word I had a call
[1:40:37] here a few months
[1:40:39] ago about or it's been about a year over
[1:40:42] a year ago a little lady on the end of a
[1:40:44] telephone connection with a Baptist
[1:40:46] preacher and a Pentecostal preacher she
[1:40:48] said brother random the Lord has made me
[1:40:50] a prophet said fine said you know I'm
[1:40:54] told that you said that you you bore
[1:40:56] record that my Ministry was of God now I
[1:40:59] couldn't do that's contrary to the word
[1:41:02] so I said lady that's an error I don't
[1:41:04] even know you and the Baptist preacher I
[1:41:07] heard him I heard the Pentecostal
[1:41:09] preacher she said well I'm having a
[1:41:10] meeting here and said the Lord is doing
[1:41:13] great things I said I'm grateful for
[1:41:15] that she said uh I said has he ever told
[1:41:19] you anything yet said yes I've got a
[1:41:21] great program in hand I said wonderful I
[1:41:24] said now watch your program I said what
[1:41:26] did the Lord tell you he said go to
[1:41:28] Phoenix Arizona on a certain certain
[1:41:32] date and that I'm going to give you the
[1:41:35] lost Dutchman go mine and you're going
[1:41:37] to take this gold is found in there and
[1:41:39] you're going to sponsor missionaries
[1:41:41] around the world when we all know that
[1:41:43] the lost Dutchman mind is a
[1:41:45] legend so he said I said well I'll tell
[1:41:49] you how to find out whether it's God or
[1:41:51] not I said you be there on that
[1:41:56] day and if it's you find the lost
[1:41:59] judment mind then it's God if you don't
[1:42:02] find the lost that's your mind then
[1:42:04] repent and get that line Spirit off of
[1:42:07] you that's TR to find out Where's God or
[1:42:10] not God said Moses throw down a stick
[1:42:12] it'll turn to a serpent he did it he
[1:42:14] said pick it up it'll be a stick again
[1:42:16] he did it when God makes a promise of a
[1:42:19] Ministry in this last days he'll confirm
[1:42:22] it just exactly the way he said he would
[1:42:25] do it and you know you got the right
[1:42:27] voice you're listening to the right
[1:42:29] thing because it's the word being
[1:42:32] confirmed oh how I'm sorry I all right
[1:42:36] Moses acted different look what a a
[1:42:40] funny thing Moses done now always when
[1:42:43] you're following the voice of God you're
[1:42:45] crazy to the
[1:42:46] world the next day found Moses with his
[1:42:50] wife sitting on a
[1:42:52] mu and a young man on her hip or that's
[1:42:54] Souther
[1:42:56] child on her hip and there there was
[1:42:59] this old man with beard hanging down
[1:43:01] like this this bald head shining a stick
[1:43:04] in his hand leaving a little donkey
[1:43:05] going right down toward Jesus if as hard
[1:43:07] as he could go somebody said Moses where
[1:43:09] are you going going down to Egypt to
[1:43:11] take the thing
[1:43:12] over where with he had failed as a young
[1:43:16] man he failed as a military man but here
[1:43:20] he was going down to take over and he
[1:43:22] did it
[1:43:23] why he had heard the voice of God and
[1:43:26] seen it Vindicated for his day for the
[1:43:30] things that was to be in his day he saw
[1:43:33] it Paul a self- style Pharisee just as
[1:43:36] full of theology as he could be but one
[1:43:39] day he heard the voice of God he saw a
[1:43:42] pillar of
[1:43:44] fire and he know there was something
[1:43:47] different it changed his life no matter
[1:43:50] how many Pharisees how many G failures
[1:43:53] or anything else could cry out to Paul
[1:43:55] you're wrong you're wrong Paul had heard
[1:43:57] the voice of God he know it was a
[1:44:00] truth Peter religious as he could be
[1:44:03] keeping the traditions of the elders he
[1:44:06] would not eat any meat no sir he would
[1:44:09] have nothing to do about it at all he
[1:44:11] was really keeping the traditions of the
[1:44:13] elders right to the word what happened
[1:44:16] one day he heard the voice of
[1:44:19] God don't call that common unlean what I
[1:44:23] make clean he was a changed man he is
[1:44:27] ready to go anywhere the Lord sent him
[1:44:30] closing him I say this there was a man
[1:44:33] one time who was a
[1:44:35] Believer he'd been dead four
[1:44:38] days he was in the grave stinking
[1:44:44] rotten but he heard the voice of God
[1:44:47] speak Lazarus come
[1:44:51] forth and if it brought a man forth
[1:44:53] after being dead and
[1:44:55] rotten what ought to do to a church that
[1:44:58] still has life in it amen it ought to
[1:45:01] resurrect them in the mess of all these
[1:45:05] voices that we've talked about religious
[1:45:09] politics Hollywood all the false
[1:45:12] prophecies and things that's gone out in
[1:45:14] the midst of all of it the true voice of
[1:45:17] God will call a man that's dead in sin
[1:45:19] and trespasses to life again it ought to
[1:45:23] make a backslid church and call it to
[1:45:25] life again
[1:45:28] sure remember in closing I say this now
[1:45:33] I'll close Jesus said the time would
[1:45:36] come when all that was in the grave
[1:45:39] would hear the voice of God you're going
[1:45:42] to hear it no matter what condition
[1:45:44] you're in you're going to hear it anyhow
[1:45:46] and some of them that come out of the
[1:45:48] Grave will come to condemnation they
[1:45:53] hear the voice but it's
[1:45:55] condemning and if you hear today today
[1:45:59] after so long a time when you hear my
[1:46:01] voice Harden not your hearts as you did
[1:46:04] in the days of
[1:46:06] provocation if you Pentecostal people
[1:46:10] grouping yourself out in Creeds again in
[1:46:14] whirlin having a farm of Godless and
[1:46:17] denying the power thereof before you
[1:46:20] have to rise and the resurrection to be
[1:46:22] condemned because the voice of God that
[1:46:24] speaks to you now through the word will
[1:46:26] condemn you in that
[1:46:28] day if you're just a lukewarm believer
[1:46:32] the voice of God cries in your heart
[1:46:34] this morning you are a lukewarm believer
[1:46:36] you'd better
[1:46:41] repent you man women boys or girl that's
[1:46:44] not living for Christ and the voice of
[1:46:47] God speaks to you through his word and
[1:46:49] says stop doing that you better do it
[1:46:53] because you're going to hear it again
[1:46:54] one day and it'll condemn you you can't
[1:46:57] deny it it's speaking to you
[1:46:59] now and remember it's
[1:47:03] recorded and those who does
[1:47:07] right and hears his voice will
[1:47:10] rise the righteousness the
[1:47:16] glory the heaven
[1:47:27] hallu it's
[1:47:37] gold all of this
[1:47:40] message has to be flowing through our
[1:47:45] veins we have to become the word
[1:47:59] I'd like to share something that the
[1:48:01] Lord had placed on my heart
[1:48:08] uh and and all of this condition that
[1:48:11] we're living in all this house or chaos
[1:48:14] that we're living
[1:48:16] in a lot of times that our our spiritual
[1:48:20] condition
[1:48:23] is look
[1:48:26] warm and and the prophet says
[1:48:30] this in paragraph
[1:48:39] 107 it says that if you are just if you
[1:48:42] are just lukewarm believer the voice of
[1:48:46] God cries in your heart this morning you
[1:48:48] are a lukewarm believer you better
[1:48:52] repent
[1:48:53] you better
[1:48:58] repent the condition that the Lord gives
[1:49:03] us through his word and his
[1:49:09] message it tells us to be able to
[1:49:14] repent you must be born again and i'
[1:49:17] would like to read a quote from you must
[1:49:18] be born
[1:49:19] again paragraph 60
[1:49:27] okay okay so you must be born again 1961
[1:49:31] 12:31 the morning service paragraph 50
[1:49:34] if they can 60 paragraph 60 it says
[1:49:37] Jesus when he was here on Earth he said
[1:49:41] talking to Nicodemus here he said as
[1:49:43] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:49:46] wilderness so must the son of man be
[1:49:48] lifted up so must why in the same manner
[1:49:53] for the same thing the same purpose to
[1:49:56] do the same work many times disposal
[1:50:00] people when they see the serpent
[1:50:03] representing Jesus the serpent
[1:50:06] represented Jesus in this much did you
[1:50:09] notice the serpent was dead there was no
[1:50:13] life in it Jesus died like came when he
[1:50:17] slew Abel Abel died on the altar with
[1:50:21] his sacrifice amen after Abel offered
[1:50:25] his sacrifice and killed his sacrifice
[1:50:27] for his sin then he died on the same
[1:50:31] altar with his sacrifice in order to be
[1:50:35] born again you have to sacrifice for his
[1:50:40] sin then he died on the same altar with
[1:50:44] his sacrifice in order to be born again
[1:50:48] you have to die on The Altar with your
[1:50:51] sacrifice just as dead as he was and
[1:50:55] you're born again the serpent had no
[1:50:58] life in it
[1:51:01] amen
[1:51:08] so the prophet says that we would have
[1:51:10] to bring the sacrifice to the
[1:51:13] altar to be able to be born
[1:51:16] again be to be a dead
[1:51:21] man and I'd like to read out of Romans
[1:51:24] chapter
[1:51:28] 12 verses 1 and
[1:51:35] two how
[1:51:39] listen it's the word of
[1:51:42] God if if we want to stop being
[1:51:47] lukewarm just like we said from the
[1:51:49] beginning there's a lot of voices
[1:51:50] there's a lot of influences
[1:51:54] the word god brings us back to the
[1:51:57] original
[1:51:58] condition we have have to obey or or or
[1:52:01] submit oursel to the word of
[1:52:04] God and and the word of the Lord says
[1:52:08] this I beseech you therefore
[1:52:12] Brethren by the mercies of
[1:52:15] God that you present your
[1:52:19] body a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:52:24] acceptable acceptable unto the
[1:52:30] Lord which is your reasonable
[1:52:37] service performed to this
[1:52:42] world but be ye transformed by the
[1:52:45] renewing of your
[1:52:48] mind that he may prove
[1:52:52] what is that that's
[1:52:54] good and acable and perfect will of
[1:53:00] God
[1:53:01] we we have to
[1:53:05] die so that Christ can be able to live
[1:53:07] inside of
[1:53:08] us that would be able to take flesh to
[1:53:11] be
[1:53:13] one and our B would be able to be a
[1:53:16] Living
[1:53:18] Sacrifice on the altar of God
[1:53:29] I'd like to just bring one more quote
[1:53:31] just because the word is so
[1:53:35] wonderful you must be born again another
[1:53:38] another another paragraph from you must
[1:53:40] be born again the same service
[1:53:43] 35 and now I'm saying this and I know
[1:53:47] it's going on tape and I want to say
[1:53:50] this to the pastors that will perhaps
[1:53:54] receive this tape I suppose may be just
[1:53:57] a little different from what the regular
[1:53:59] Church teaches it I teach and
[1:54:03] believe and belief can sufficiently
[1:54:06] prove by the scripture that you're born
[1:54:09] of the spirit and then baptized into the
[1:54:12] body by the holy spirit
[1:54:18] amen we are born in the spirit
[1:54:22] and and I'd like to read and with this
[1:54:25] we will uh
[1:54:28] close Ephesians chapter
[1:54:36] three I'm
[1:54:38] sorry okay chapter

[1:56:27] Christ yeah that we henceforth be no
[1:56:31] more children tossed to and fro and
[1:56:34] carried about with every wind of

[1:59:44] us that we were dead and our sins and
[1:59:48] trespasses we were you were without God
[1:59:52] but he had chosen
[1:59:54] us not for something that we

[2:00:04] thing God created all the
[2:00:10] conditions uh he gave us all that he was
[2:00:13] able to offer

[2:05:30] that's what he desires he said they'll
[2:05:33] know you they'll know you are my
[2:05:35] disciples by your love one for another
[2:05:37] John wrote out he says if a
[2:05:40] man say he loves God and hates his
[2:05:44] brother he's not even speaking the truth
[2:05:46] that's right you know
[2:05:48] just the the fact that we're a body and
[2:05:52] we should care one for another and love
[2:05:54] one for another and be fitted together
[2:05:56] and you know what fits us together so
[2:05:58] beautifully is we all have the same
[2:06:01] attribute we all have the same voice we
[2:06:05] were all paid for with the same
[2:06:08] price and if we could just stay that way
[2:06:10] and stay
[2:06:11] humble and and just give of yourself and
