[29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's open our Bibles in Matthew
[29:11] chapter 16.
[29:18] Matthew chapter 16 and uh uh we're going
[29:21] to begin at at verse 14.
[29:34] Hallelujah.
[29:36] Matthew 16 verse14.
[29:40] And they said, oh, you're ready.
[29:45] Amen.
[29:46] Praise the Lord. And that said, some say
[29:49] that thou art John the Baptist, some
[29:52] Elias, and others Jeremiah or one of the
[29:54] prophets. He said unto them, "But whom
[29:58] say ye that I that I am?"
[30:00] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[30:02] art the Christ, the Son of the living
[30:04] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[30:07] him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah,
[30:11] for flesh and blood have not revealed it
[30:13] unto thee, but my father which is in
[30:16] heaven. And I said unto thee, that thou
[30:20] art Peter, and upon this rock I will
[30:22] build my church, and the gates of hell
[30:26] shall not prevail against it. That's
[30:28] right.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; And I will give unto thee the keys of
[30:30] the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever
[30:33] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[30:35] in heaven,
[30:37] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[30:40] shall be loosed in heaven.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank
[30:45] you Lord for the opportunity you give us
[30:48] to come together and learn from your
[30:50] word. Father, Lord, you have placed a
[30:53] thought in my heart, Lord. And Father,
[30:56] help me to share with your children,
[30:59] Lord, what you have placed in my heart
[31:01] and bless us. Bless the word, Father.
[31:03] Bless our pastor. Bless every minister
[31:07] min ministry in this place, Lord. And
[31:09] Lord, that you may come and speak to us
[31:12] once again, Lord. Father God, help me to
[31:15] put myself aside. Lord, that your Holy
[31:17] Ghost may take uh control of everything
[31:20] that I say and do. Father, close my
[31:23] mouth to anything that is contrary to
[31:25] your word and open it to all truth and
[31:28] righteousness. For I ask it in Jesus
[31:30] Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated.
[31:34] Hallelujah.
[31:36] It's uh it's always uh nerve-wracking
[31:41] to see to have so many eyes looking at
[31:43] you. Hallelujah.
[31:46] But we are happy to be here.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; And um I I would like to to uh if if we
[31:52] can title this uh thought, I would like
[31:55] to title it against the the gates of
[31:58] hell.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; Against the gates of hell. Uh, brother
[32:03] Branham, I I was listening to uh, works
[32:06] is faith express preaching 65
[32:10] and and brother Bram says, "It was upon
[32:12] the spiritual revelation of who he was.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[32:17] you, Peter. But my father which is in
[32:20] heaven has revealed this to you and upon
[32:22] this rock, the revelation of who he is."
[32:26] upon the revelation. He is a word in the
[32:30] whole. Upon this rock I I build my
[32:34] church and the gates of hell cannot
[32:36] prevail against it. It showed the gates
[32:40] of hell would be against it.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; So the gates of hell are against the
[32:46] revelation
[32:48] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus Christ is. That's why
[32:51] there's been a battle for over 2,000
[32:53] years
[32:54] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus Christ is
[32:56] &gt;&gt; and the council of Nika. Do you know how
[32:59] they split
[33:00] &gt;&gt; and they split over the name
[33:03] &gt;&gt; and anyone who did not agree with with
[33:06] Constantine was kicked out and was
[33:09] persecuted and the church has been
[33:11] persecuted for 2,000 years now.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God slowly but surely has been
[33:17] restoring everything back to the church
[33:20] &gt;&gt; until we get to our age where everything
[33:23] that we need to go into the rapture has
[33:26] been restored.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we don't make it in the
[33:29] rapture, it's our fault.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Cuz you and I had been given every tool
[33:36] that's needed to go in the rapture.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[33:41] You know,
[33:43] &gt;&gt; it's 1,200 uh sermons.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; We have no excuse.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; We're like, "Oh, I don't know what to do
[33:52] tonight." Listen to a message.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm bored. Listen to a message.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; I'm going to drive eight hours. Listen
[34:00] to a message.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; I cannot go to sleep.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Listen to a message.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[34:10] That's that that's that's what I'm
[34:11] saying.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; We have the tools.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; We have the tools. We have to use the
[34:17] tools.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; If you don't use the tools, you cannot
[34:20] prevail.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; You cannot prevail if you don't use the
[34:24] tools.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; The tools are given to you to prevail to
[34:28] overcome
[34:29] &gt;&gt; to def to defeat the enemy that has been
[34:32] defeated already. Amen.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; You know, in Second World War uh in and
[34:37] when when when when the United States uh
[34:39] uh bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
[34:43] the the war was over
[34:46] cuz I mean and imagine no one can stand
[34:49] against that power.
[34:51] But you see there was they didn't have
[34:53] the the communication we have now,
[34:56] &gt;&gt; you know,
[34:57] &gt;&gt; except for today. Verizon is not
[34:58] working.
[35:00] But we they didn't have the
[35:01] communication we that that we have now.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; So for months many people did not know
[35:08] that the war was over.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; There were a lot of Americans fighting
[35:13] in many islands
[35:15] &gt;&gt; who thought they were losing the battle
[35:17] &gt;&gt; because if it was one to one against the
[35:19] enemy, the American people did not have
[35:22] any opportunity
[35:24] &gt;&gt; because the Japanese were fearless. The
[35:27] Japanese, one Japanese man could kill
[35:31] many people.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; The Japanese thought they were fighting
[35:37] a a war or a battle that they were
[35:39] winning,
[35:40] &gt;&gt; but if it was a paradox
[35:44] &gt;&gt; cuz they were winning a battle, but they
[35:47] lost a war.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[35:51] And the Americans were losing a battle.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; But they had already won the war.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; You know, we are about the same
[36:03] &gt;&gt; cuz Satan knows he lost the war.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; But he is a liar.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; He is a master of deceit.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; And he makes us think that we are lost.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; He makes us think that think that we are
[36:16] losers.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; No, you're not a loser. I'm not a loser.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody is a loser in this place
[36:25] &gt;&gt; because we are on the side of the one
[36:28] who overcame.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; He defeated Satan.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; He defeated the grave.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; He defeated death.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; And that's it. My sermon is over. God
[36:38] bless you.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; You get I get too excited.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Pray for me.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Pray for me. Amen.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Genesis 22,
[36:50] &gt;&gt; we find Abraham.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Now remember, we we are we are talking
[36:54] about the gates, the gates of hell
[36:57] prevailing. No, we prevail against the g
[37:00] gates of hell.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell against the children
[37:04] of God. Satan from the beginning, that's
[37:07] that he he he he his his uh idea was to
[37:11] be he wants to be worshiped like God,
[37:14] &gt;&gt; right? He wants to defeat God's plan.
[37:18] But how can you defeat the one who knows
[37:21] everything?
[37:22] &gt;&gt; He knows your thoughts
[37:24] &gt;&gt; and he knows the intentions of your
[37:26] thoughts.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So how can Satan fight against a
[37:30] person like that? But Satan is very
[37:33] intelligent,
[37:34] &gt;&gt; you know. He is more intelligent than
[37:36] than all of us together.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; He knows the Bible better than all of us
[37:40] together. He knows science better than
[37:43] than the scientist.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:47] But we know God.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; That's all we need.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; And it came uh Genesis 22:1.
[37:58] And it came to pass after this things
[38:00] that God did tempt Abraham, and said
[38:03] unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold,
[38:05] here I am. And he said, "Take now thy
[38:08] son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
[38:11] lovest, and get thee into the land of
[38:14] Mariah, and offer him there for a burnt
[38:17] offering upon one of the mountains,
[38:20] which I will tell thee of."
[38:23] &gt;&gt; So God is testing
[38:25] his son.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "God loves to test his
[38:30] children
[38:33] &gt;&gt; to see how we are going to react.
[38:37] He gives you a test.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; If you have if you if you are been
[38:41] tested, it's from God.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Don't blame the poor devil.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; It's God
[38:48] &gt;&gt; giving you a test
[38:50] &gt;&gt; because he wants to make you realize
[38:55] that you are an overcomer.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; And look, and then then let's just skip
[39:03] to verse 11. And Abraham obeys God.
[39:07] Isaac is on the altar. He's about to
[39:11] kill his only son, the one that he spoke
[39:16] about for 25 years.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; And now he's about to kill him and he's
[39:22] willing to kill him.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; But you have to understand to do the
[39:26] sacrifice, the whole sacrifice, it was
[39:29] not just to kill Isaac. It was to burn
[39:32] him.
[39:35] ashes to ashes.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; But he knew that the one who gave the
[39:40] promise
[39:41] &gt;&gt; even from the ashes can bring his his
[39:44] son back.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; That's that's the God we serve.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; He wants to see our reaction. He wants
[39:52] to see my reaction.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; You know, you know what happens when
[39:56] when you don't pass a test?
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, there you go. You have to retake it.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; If you don't pass a grade, said, "Well,
[40:08] I'm sorry, Mr. Sergio. Your son didn't
[40:11] pass fifth grade."
[40:14] Well, what if I give you $100?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be helping my son.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; No, he has to take it again
[40:25] &gt;&gt; and take it again and take it again
[40:28] until he passes that.
[40:30] Sometimes we go in a circle.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; And you know why we go in a circle?
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Because we're not passing the test,
[40:39] &gt;&gt; you know,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; and to pass a test, you have to study,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot study the night before the
[40:47] test and then pray and be like, I know
[40:49] God is going to help me. No, he's not.
[40:54] No, you have to memorize everything.
[40:57] You have to know 2 plus 2 is four. 2 * 2
[41:01] is four, right?
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. 8 by two is four. You have to
[41:08] know all the answers.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; You have to know what you're doing,
[41:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:14] &gt;&gt; But if you don't study,
[41:17] if you don't get prepared,
[41:19] &gt;&gt; you will fail again.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; And that's where many of us are.
[41:26] You have all the tools there.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Remember, you have the tools.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell are against you. Satan
[41:35] doesn't want you to overcome. He doesn't
[41:38] want you to pass a test. He wants you to
[41:40] stay where you're at.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, let me tell
[41:44] you, as long as we are here on on on
[41:46] this flesh, we need to get better.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Is not you you
[41:52] can't just be like, "Oh, well, I already
[41:55] made it." Yes, but I God wants you to
[41:57] get better
[41:58] &gt;&gt; every time, every day,
[42:00] &gt;&gt; every hour.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And he will test you once and once
[42:05] again,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; and he will pass you through the fire
[42:08] once and once again because you're too
[42:11] precious to him. You're more precious
[42:13] than gold.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your faith needs to be tested. My
[42:18] faith needs to be tested.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And the angel of Genesis 22.
[42:26] And the angel of the Lord called unto
[42:28] him out of heaven and said,"Abraham,
[42:30] Abraham," and he said, "Here, here am
[42:32] I." And he said, "Lay not thine hand
[42:34] upon the lad, neither do thou anything
[42:37] unto him. For now I know that thou
[42:40] fearest God, seeing thou hast not
[42:42] withheld thy son, thine only son, from
[42:45] me." The fear of the Lord. The fear of
[42:49] the Lord. Why are we why are we g Why
[42:52] are we willing to give up for the fear
[42:54] of the Lord?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; You know,
[43:00] &gt;&gt; why are we willing to give up for the
[43:02] fear of the Lord? Abraham was willing to
[43:05] give everything up
[43:08] &gt;&gt; to please God.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; And we are Abraham's seed
[43:15] &gt;&gt; by faith
[43:17] &gt;&gt; because we have the same faith of
[43:19] Abraham. Verse
[43:22] 13. And Abraham lift up his eyes and
[43:25] looked, and behold, behind him a ram
[43:27] caught in a thicket by his horns. And
[43:30] Abraham went and took the ram and offer
[43:32] him up for a burnt offering in the in
[43:35] the state of his son. God provides.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; God will let you go to the edge
[43:42] to the very end of the trial. And as
[43:45] long as you keep trusting him, he will
[43:48] give you the answer.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; He will give you the exit.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; He will show there for you.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; You don't know how, but he will do it.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; He will do it.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. And
[44:03] Abraham called the name of that place
[44:04] Jehovah Gyra. As it is said to this day,
[44:07] in the mount of the Lord it shall be
[44:09] seen. And the angel of the Lord called
[44:12] unto Abraham out of heaven the second
[44:14] time, and said, By myself have I sworn,
[44:18] sayeth the Lord, for because thou hast
[44:20] done this thing, and hast not withheld
[44:22] thy son, thine than only son,
[44:25] that in that in blessing I will bless
[44:28] thee,
[44:29] &gt;&gt; and in multiplying
[44:31] I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[44:35] heaven.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; We are like the stars of heaven.
[44:40] No wonder there were seven stars on his
[44:43] right hand because they were Abraham's
[44:47] seed.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[44:51] That in that in blessing I will bless
[44:54] thee that in multiplying I will multiply
[44:56] thy seed as the stars of heaven and as a
[44:58] sand which is upon the seashore. And thy
[45:00] seed shall possess the gates of his
[45:05] enemies.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the gates of hell shall not
[45:09] prevail
[45:11] &gt;&gt; against they
[45:12] &gt;&gt; against the revelation.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Your seat shall possess the gates of its
[45:18] enemies.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Now the Paul teaches us that we're not
[45:22] fighting against flesh or blood.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; But we're fighting against powers of the
[45:28] air.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; We're fighting against spirits.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; That's what we fight. The devil comes
[45:35] and he puts thoughts in our heads and
[45:37] he's all the time
[45:39] &gt;&gt; putting thoughts in our heads and we
[45:41] have to be careful what we put in our
[45:43] head.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? That's the reason
[45:46] that you have to fill your head.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz you will be thinking about this if
[45:56] you fill it with this. If you wake up in
[45:59] the morning,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; when you wake up, huh, and instead of
[46:03] opening the word, you open something
[46:06] else, that's what's going to be in your
[46:07] head.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Before you go to sleep
[46:10] &gt;&gt; before you go to sleep, whatever you're
[46:12] thinking about, that's what's going to
[46:13] be in your head.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So, we need the tools.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; The tools are reliable.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; They're given to us in the form of a
[46:22] book. And if you have a phone, you even
[46:25] can put it in an app. You even can play
[46:28] uh Brother Brian, I'm on YouTube. You
[46:31] can play the Bible on YouTube. You can
[46:34] download an app and play the Bible on
[46:36] your app.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; There's no excuse.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; If you haven't read the Bible, and I
[46:43] don't mean like one chapter or
[46:45] threequarters of the Bible or half of
[46:47] the Bible,
[46:51] but if you haven't read the Bible from
[46:53] Genesis to Revelation,
[46:58] You're lacking tools.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; You need the tools.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; So do something.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; You know,
[47:12] I need to memorize it. I need to
[47:14] memorize it. No, it's not going to work
[47:15] like that. Open it and read it.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; It's your tools to overcome the devil.
[47:22] You know, Brother Ram says, "We we we we
[47:24] want something exciting and and and you
[47:27] know, jumping and fire falling from
[47:29] heaven and and everybody screaming, but
[47:31] you know what? When you go home, when
[47:33] you when when all that scream and all
[47:35] that, it's nice. Don't get me wrong. I
[47:37] like to scream when I feel the praise of
[47:39] the Lord. It's all nice. But when you
[47:41] get home, you go back to reality,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; you know,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; and reality reality tells you, uhoh,
[47:49] &gt;&gt; I need to pay my bills.
[47:52] I have problems at work.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; How am I going to do this? How am I
[47:55] going to fix my car? How am I going to
[47:57] pay for this? How am I going to do the
[47:59] other thing? Oh, my children, my wife,
[48:01] my husband. I'm sick. I need to go to
[48:04] the doctor. The doctor told me I have
[48:05] cancer. What if the doctor tells me I
[48:07] have cancer?
[48:09] It's a fight. It's a fight. It's a fight
[48:11] every single day. Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; But when you fill yourself with this,
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Abraham says this is the most powerful
[48:19] tool,
[48:20] &gt;&gt; the most powerful weapon
[48:22] &gt;&gt; that God gave to his children.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says if God had anything
[48:27] better to give us, he would have given
[48:29] it to us.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; I heard somebody if you got if you want
[48:34] God to speak to you, read your Bible out
[48:37] loud.
[48:43] You know, cuz we we want something
[48:45] exciting. No, it's there
[48:48] &gt;&gt; every day. Your daily walk
[48:51] &gt;&gt; builds your character.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And character is not a gift.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Character is a victory.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every every trial that you pass is
[49:01] a victory.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Every storm you go through is a victory.
[49:08] Every time you obey God, even when you
[49:10] don't feel like it, it's a victory.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Even when you're crying,
[49:16] &gt;&gt; you can go to school tomorrow and they
[49:20] tell you you have a test.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Say, "But I didn't study for that test."
[49:24] It don't matter. You're going to have a
[49:25] test tomorrow. I'm not prophesying, by
[49:28] the way. Okay? It's not You're going to
[49:30] be worried like what?
[49:32] &gt;&gt; You're going to have a test tomorrow.
[49:35] You go to school, you sit there, you're
[49:36] thinking, "Oh, well, we're going to go
[49:38] to chapter 15 of science or whatever
[49:41] you're taking there, physics." And all
[49:42] of a sudden, your teacher says, "Well,
[49:44] put your books away. Put your
[49:46] calculators away. Put your your
[49:49] telephones away. We are going to have a
[49:51] test.
[49:53] Surprise.
[49:55] You can cry if you want to. That's good.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; But that's not going to help you.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; You can answer your test crying." Yes.
[50:05] You know, be so mad at the teacher on
[50:06] why do I get a test today? Well, your
[50:09] teacher has been telling you for every
[50:11] hour you go to school, you have to study
[50:13] how many at home.
[50:18] Three hours for every hour of class. Can
[50:21] you believe that? No time.
[50:25] That's so crazy.
[50:27] But that's what they expect from from
[50:29] everybody that goes to to college.
[50:32] What about the Bible?
[50:35] What about the word of God?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; That's what they expect you. Then you
[50:40] get a test and you're like, I don't know
[50:41] the answer. I don't know the answer. The
[50:43] doctor said I was I'm sick and I don't
[50:45] know the answer. Yes, you know the
[50:47] answer. Calm down.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Take a deep breath.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Look at the question
[50:54] &gt;&gt; and think
[50:56] by his stripes
[50:59] &gt;&gt; I've been healed.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:03] Well, I I don't know how am I going to
[51:05] pay for this.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; He's still your provider.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; You know, but my children, they you
[51:13] don't understand, brother. I I I raised
[51:15] them in in the in the in the church. I
[51:17] raised them in the message. I did the
[51:18] best I could, but like they they're
[51:20] going to the world. Don't worry, they'll
[51:22] come back.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It's a promise. Remember, we've been
[51:27] listening to live taking the promises of
[51:30] God
[51:30] &gt;&gt; and make making them alive for us.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; It's a living promise.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; So when you when you when you're going
[51:38] through the test, it's all right to cry.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; When you go through the test, it's all
[51:43] right to be mad. Jonah was mad.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Jeremiah was crying.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; You know,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; it's all right. Don't worry. You will
[51:54] pass a test.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; You will pass a test.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have to take it again, but you
[52:01] will pass it
[52:03] &gt;&gt; because he will make sure that you pass
[52:04] a test
[52:06] &gt;&gt; because the gates of hell cannot prevail
[52:09] against the church of the living God.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many demons from
[52:15] hell come to torment you. Let me tell
[52:18] you, they have no power over the
[52:20] children of the living God.
[52:25] Who?
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; He overcame.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[52:36] You you you have to go through the test.
[52:38] You have to be willing to go through the
[52:40] test.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; In order to receive the blessing,
[52:43] &gt;&gt; in order to receive that blessing, your
[52:46] seed shall possess the gates of their
[52:48] enemies.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] You see, I'm under that promise. And my
[52:55] children, I don't know if they know it
[52:56] or not, but they're under that promise.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; My wife is under that promise.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; We are going to possess the gate of our
[53:05] enemies.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Said, "Lord, brother, but you know, I I
[53:13] need this. I need that job. I need that
[53:15] position, but they're not going to give
[53:16] it to me." Says who? Right.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Says who?
[53:23] &gt;&gt; If you know it's going to get you closer
[53:24] to the Lord,
[53:26] go around there 13 times.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[53:34] So, it's mine.
[53:37] It's mine. The Lord said it's mine
[53:41] because you have to believe
[53:43] the confession of your mouth. Amen.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; That's that's that's what what the third
[53:50] pool that's what the what what what the
[53:52] voice told brother Ranham when he said
[53:54] the squirrels
[53:56] &gt;&gt; said but but I I one was created
[53:58] already. Yeah but you said three.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; He said you need to believe in the
[54:03] confession of your mouth.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. Not just say it
[54:11] &gt;&gt; but believe it. Amen.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Well, one of my children came back to
[54:14] the word. Well, I don't know how many
[54:16] you have left,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; but keep confessing.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Keep confessing.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; His promises are true.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; His promises are real.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; They do not fail.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I fail, you fail, and everybody fails.
[54:32] But God cannot fail.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; In the in the message the patriarch
[54:41] Abraham preaching 64, brother Abraham
[54:44] says that's just exactly what it means.
[54:46] I believe it's par paragraph 12. Now, if
[54:49] you're ready to take the test of God's
[54:52] acid test,
[54:54] you know, when you go and pay with a
[54:56] bill, $100 bill, they have a little pen.
[55:02] It's got some kind of asset. They test
[55:04] it, see if it's real or not.
[55:09] You are the real deal.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; You are. You are the real deal. That's
[55:16] why you're being tested.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; You're being tested because God wants
[55:20] you to know who you are.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; He wants you to realize
[55:26] what you're made of.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's hard. Test is not easy.
[55:34] No, it's not easy. But once you pass a
[55:36] test, you're like, "Yes, I made it."
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody might say, "Well, look, I got
[55:42] an A+. I got a C minus." But I made it.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; You know, we laugh about those things,
[55:50] but it's true.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; A lot of times it's only his grace and
[55:53] mercy that help us move forward.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz man, so many times we just go
[55:59] through the word of God with a C minus,
[56:01] C minus, C minus. But thanks be to God
[56:04] that he's rich in mercy.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "I know my son Sergio, he is
[56:10] not an A+ Christian, but hey, he's
[56:14] making it. One of these days, he's going
[56:16] to straighten himself up.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You know, he's going to be an A+ and I'm
[56:20] going to be proud of him and I'm going
[56:22] to seal him with my Holy Ghost."
[56:25] But keep going. Don't give up.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Don't give up.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Don't put your books down,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; you know. No, don't don't put your Bible
[56:32] down. Just because you're going through
[56:34] the trial doesn't mean the answer is not
[56:36] here. Just because you're going through
[56:38] the trial doesn't mean God is not
[56:40] answering your prayers. Just keep
[56:42] talking to him. He is our teacher. He is
[56:46] our master.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And follow that prescription. I'm
[56:53] telling you, you'll find out that God
[56:55] keeps his word if you believe it.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's right. But you
[57:01] got to go through that because that's
[57:02] the seal. When you can receive it, then
[57:05] you will receive the promise because
[57:07] it's God's prescription. The way we
[57:10] should do it and that's the way we got
[57:12] to follow it. Just what he said. Not not
[57:16] just to some, but to whosoever
[57:18] believeth. Whosoever repenteth,
[57:21] whosoever believeth is to all
[57:22] generations, to all people, whosoever
[57:25] wants to believe it. And faith in God's
[57:27] word brings you to his promise.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be in his word.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; You have to believe his word.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; In order to believe his word, you have
[57:40] to know what it says.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody says, "Open your Bible in
[57:46] Psalms 152." And you're like,
[57:50] "Very worried." No, you already failed
[57:52] the test.
[57:55] Amen.
[57:57] Yes.
[57:59] It's simple.
[58:01] If if you stay in the word, if you fill
[58:04] your mind with the word, God will do the
[58:07] rest.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; And God will make sure that the word
[58:10] comes down into your heart. When I was
[58:12] when I I when I went I I got a
[58:15] scholarship when I got out of high
[58:16] school and I I went for music, okay?
[58:19] because I didn't know any better and I
[58:22] thought, you know, well, that's the
[58:23] life. But I was poor, poorer.
[58:28] I was poor. I'm not poor anymore. I have
[58:31] Christ,
[58:32] &gt;&gt; and I have three beautiful girls, one
[58:35] beautiful wife, and one very handsome
[58:38] son. I think that makes me more than
[58:40] rich,
[58:42] &gt;&gt; you know. I'm I'm I'm going to I'm going
[58:45] to be African, and for my girls, I'm
[58:46] going to ask for cows.
[58:50] Rich brother
[58:52] said, "Brother Sergio, I'm sorry. My
[58:55] mind wanders. Pray for me.
[59:00] Pray for me."
[59:04] Now, when my son gets married, I'll
[59:05] become Mexican again.
[59:09] But let me tell you, God's promises are
[59:11] true.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; They don't fail.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; They don't fail.
[59:18] You're going through the trial, you're
[59:19] going through the tribulation, the
[59:21] answer is in his word.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; No matter what the problem is, the
[59:25] answer is in his word.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Says it's cancer, the answer is in his
[59:29] word. Amen. It's marital problems, the
[59:32] answer is in the word. Children problem,
[59:33] the answer is in the word. Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; You need to gain weight, the answer is
[59:38] in the word. You need to lose weight,
[59:40] the answer is in the word. He said every
[59:42] answer. Every answer, brother. Yes. You
[59:45] want to know what type of car you need
[59:47] to buy? The answer is in the word. You
[59:49] want to find a girlfriend, the answer,
[59:51] well, you know what? That is stuff about
[59:53] finding girlfriend is not right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; You waste your time when you find your
[59:56] girlfriend, that's the stuff from the
[59:57] world. You want to find a wife.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible doesn't say he who findeth a
[1:00:03] girlfriend.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; the B the Bible says he who findeth a
[1:00:07] wife.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; That girlfriend and boyfriend stuff,
[1:00:13] that's from the world. If you're ready
[1:00:15] to date someone, it's because you're
[1:00:16] ready to get married.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; If you're not going to get married, then
[1:00:19] stop it.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Don't play games because you're playing
[1:00:22] the devil's games.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was part of the test,
[1:00:26] brother.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; It was not in in here, but God knows
[1:00:29] that somebody needs to listen to that.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. So, if you're 15 and you're
[1:00:35] thinking, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your daddy said.
[1:00:41] I'm telling you, no.
[1:00:47] That's right.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Say amen if you have a
[1:00:50] daughter.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Because that's the truth.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. We we we want we we
[1:00:58] want to go with with with the with with
[1:01:00] the world.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; 75% of the marriages do not make it to
[1:01:07] one year.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; What are we doing? You know,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; because they're finding the f Let me see
[1:01:14] if it works with that one. If it
[1:01:15] doesn't, no. No. When you want to find a
[1:01:17] wife, you want to go on prayer.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; It's right here in the word.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to do what Abraham did.
[1:01:23] You know what Abraham did? He found He
[1:01:26] went looking for a wife for his son. Oh,
[1:01:28] that's old fashioned, brother.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; That's old fashioned.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. But that's part of the test.
[1:01:40] You know, you want one with little feet
[1:01:42] that smells good. That's a message. Now,
[1:01:46] huh? That one will fail you. You want
[1:01:49] the one with the pretty eyes, huh? That
[1:01:53] one will fail you. But if you're not, if
[1:01:55] you go beyond that, if you don't if
[1:01:57] you're not looking at the looks,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; but you're looking for character,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; you're looking for character, that will
[1:02:03] stay forever.
[1:02:05] That man with character. And I'm not
[1:02:07] saying that boy. No, that man. Cuz if
[1:02:09] you're marrying a boy, you're wasting
[1:02:11] your time.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; That man with character is going to
[1:02:14] stick to you.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you gain a 100 pounds,
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, he will stick with you.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; That woman with character
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; will it stick to you, brother. Even if
[1:02:27] you lose your teeth.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's what we're that we're
[1:02:34] talking about the gates of hell.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; And I know that I know that I when I
[1:02:39] talk, you know, people laugh. It doesn't
[1:02:40] matter. You have to think
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; that the devil wants to destroy you.
[1:02:44] Brother Abraham says demon in
[1:02:46] demonology, demons are here to torment
[1:02:49] us.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; So when we go into marriage, and this
[1:02:52] message was not even about marriage.
[1:02:54] It's not even in my notes, okay? But
[1:02:57] when you go into marriage and then
[1:02:59] you're not ready for it, that's the the
[1:03:02] devil's job is to torment you. And and
[1:03:05] if you are married and it's out of God's
[1:03:07] will, you will be tormented for the rest
[1:03:10] of your life. Not only because it might
[1:03:12] not work, but because if you get
[1:03:15] divorced, the devil is going to come and
[1:03:17] torment you.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; shall not prevent prevail against your
[1:03:28] marriage.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; That's a good one. Maybe I need to
[1:03:33] change the title of the sermon, brother.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:03:39] against my family.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:03:44] against my children.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:03:48] against my health. It doesn't matter
[1:03:51] what the devil tells me. It doesn't
[1:03:53] matter what the X-ray, the MRI, the
[1:03:56] cities can't tell me.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. Let me give you a
[1:04:01] little testimony.
[1:04:04] When when I came when we came here the
[1:04:06] first time, I was very sick.
[1:04:09] I I I the doctor thought that I had a
[1:04:12] tumor in my in my brain and and uh and
[1:04:16] and I I didn't feel good. Of course, you
[1:04:18] try to hide it from the children and
[1:04:20] everybody, but but I didn't feel good.
[1:04:23] And sometimes I thought maybe I didn't
[1:04:25] even think straight because, you know,
[1:04:28] it was bad. And of course, the devil
[1:04:30] comes and whispers in your ear because
[1:04:33] that's his job to torment you,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; you know, and uh and and of and and and
[1:04:40] one of the things that I did is I asked
[1:04:42] for prayer.
[1:04:43] So when when I came when I when we came
[1:04:45] here the first time and and the brother
[1:04:47] said if if you need prayer come forward.
[1:04:50] I came forward and I asked the pastor to
[1:04:52] pray for me
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and I told him what the problem is. Of
[1:04:56] course I give him the medical
[1:04:57] terminology. He's like it's a demon and
[1:05:00] he prayed for me.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Went back did the MRI the doctor said
[1:05:07] there's nothing there.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. You go through
[1:05:13] the test, you are scared, you are
[1:05:16] crying, but keep going.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Take the test anyways cuz there is a God
[1:05:20] who will answer your prayers.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; There is a God that will answer your
[1:05:25] prayers.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Whosoever believeth.
[1:05:30] Praise the Lord. And faith in God's word
[1:05:32] brings you to this promise.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Then and then only can you have power to
[1:05:38] possess the seal of the promise. You
[1:05:42] have to possess the promise. Every
[1:05:44] promise that's in the word of God, you
[1:05:46] have to make it yours.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every promise that God gave to
[1:05:50] Abraham, you have to make it yours.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; You have to claim it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; You have to claim it. It's mine. Healing
[1:05:56] is mine. Salvation is mine. The Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost is mine. Amen. Freedom is mine.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Then and then only can you have power to
[1:06:09] possess the seal of the promise. And the
[1:06:11] promise that we receive the seal is the
[1:06:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; So you wanted your answer about how how
[1:06:21] can I get when can I get married?
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Possess that seal.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Possess that seal and God will guide you
[1:06:28] to the right girl.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Possess that seal and God will guide you
[1:06:31] to the right to the right man.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. If not, you're going to be jumping.
[1:06:40] And the devil is going to torment you.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. For that is God in the
[1:06:48] form of spirit. His word in you that he
[1:06:51] comes in as you receive the word. The
[1:06:53] Holy Spirit is the only thing that can
[1:06:55] make that live.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; The word of God will become alive only
[1:07:01] through the Holy Spirit of God
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; living in you. And when you have the
[1:07:06] promise of possessing the gate of every
[1:07:08] enemy,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; did he said some of the enemies?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Did he said, "Well, maybe these enemy in
[1:07:19] that one maybe Goliath is too big for
[1:07:21] you. You won't be able to take him."
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You don't need to take Goliath. All you
[1:07:26] need is a little rock
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; and his slingshot.
[1:07:32] I I don't know if you if if if any
[1:07:34] anyone here I I used we used to make
[1:07:37] slingshots
[1:07:38] from old tires
[1:07:41] and sticks down in Mexico, right,
[1:07:44] brother? Huh? And they were we were
[1:07:47] good, brother. I mean, we're like that
[1:07:50] person over there. Let's see if I can
[1:07:52] aim.
[1:07:55] That's all you need to defeat the devil.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You need to believe in the promise of
[1:08:00] God.
[1:08:01] It might be a little revelation.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; It might look like a little revelation
[1:08:05] to you or to the world like like David's
[1:08:08] little rock.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; It was a little revelation, but that was
[1:08:11] part of Jesus. Brother said he picked
[1:08:13] five rocks. Why? That the Bible says,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; right? Brother says Jesus s Jesus. He
[1:08:19] grabbed one rock, one revelation, put it
[1:08:21] on the slingshot.
[1:08:27] He he he couldn't miss
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; because he was guided
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; by his faith in Jehovah.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; He said to to Goliath, "You come against
[1:08:37] me
[1:08:39] uh with a spear and a sword, but I come
[1:08:43] against you
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord of hosts."
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; You fight the enemy. You don't fight the
[1:08:53] enemy by yourself. It doesn't matter if
[1:08:55] you think you're little. If your
[1:08:56] revelation is little, if you don't have
[1:08:58] enough revelation, it doesn't matter. As
[1:09:00] long as you have a little revelation of
[1:09:02] who Jesus Christ is, you are on the
[1:09:04] winning side.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; As long as you have a little revelation
[1:09:07] of who Jesus Christ is, you will defeat
[1:09:09] the enemy. Not one enemy, not have the
[1:09:12] enemies, but all the enemies that stand
[1:09:15] against you, you will defeat them.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. The devil comes and and and
[1:09:25] whispers because that's his job. He's a
[1:09:27] very good whisperer, you know. Huh? He
[1:09:30] whispers. He tells you stuff when you're
[1:09:33] by yourself. He makes He wants to make
[1:09:35] you feel like you're alone. He He wants
[1:09:37] to make you feel depressed. He wants you
[1:09:39] He wants to make you feel worthless.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; But you're not worthless.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; You're not worthless.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; No, you don't have to be in depression.
[1:09:49] No, there is a God
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; who saw you before the foundation of the
[1:09:54] world and wrote your name in the lamb's
[1:09:57] book of life.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Your future is already written in the
[1:10:02] lamb's book of God.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter how it goes here on
[1:10:05] earth. You know, you may be a very rich,
[1:10:08] you may be very poor, you may be very
[1:10:10] handsome, you may not be that handsome,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but you will make it somehow.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; That's the thing about this. you will
[1:10:18] make it somehow.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's that's why
[1:10:22] that's what I love about about
[1:10:25] fellowship.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't
[1:10:29] that's what I that's what I love about
[1:10:30] fellowship. You can fellowship with a
[1:10:32] brother who is a millionaire
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and don't feel less.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; And fellowship with a brother that has
[1:10:39] nothing and don't feel more
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; cuz you know that your worth is not in
[1:10:46] the money you have or the clothes you
[1:10:48] wear.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; But your worth is in the word of God.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; The blood that purchases you.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I like what the pastor said.
[1:10:57] The blood, the same blood that purchased
[1:10:59] me purchased you. The same amount of
[1:11:01] blood that was paid for me was paid for
[1:11:03] you. So don't think that you're less.
[1:11:05] No, you're not less. It doesn't matter
[1:11:08] what Satan has gotten you through or how
[1:11:11] how how many storms he has brought to
[1:11:13] your life,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; how low you you have gone,
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; how far away you have gone,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; you're you're worth it before the sight
[1:11:23] of the Lord.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He paid for you.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; He died for you. He cried for you
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; because of you. He was in Gethsemane and
[1:11:34] he was about to give up because he was
[1:11:36] just a man.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brother Graham says the
[1:11:40] victory was not obtained in Calvary. The
[1:11:42] victory was obtained in Gethsemane when
[1:11:44] he said not my will be done father but
[1:11:47] your will be done.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when we do God's will then
[1:11:50] we have the victory because he will get
[1:11:52] you through.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; He will get you through. When Jesus was
[1:11:56] walking to Calvary, he wasn't walking as
[1:11:58] God. He was walking as man because he
[1:12:01] was showing the devil that any man that
[1:12:04] any man can defeat Satan.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; He wasn't in he wasn't going in like God
[1:12:13] cuz God cannot die.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That's why he said
[1:12:19] but my Lord why my Lord why have you
[1:12:20] forsaken me? Imagine feeling all the
[1:12:24] fullness of God your whole life.
[1:12:28] Fullness feel filling all the fullness
[1:12:30] of God. The whole power of the universe
[1:12:34] more than the universe. The creator of
[1:12:36] the universe. and for three years and a
[1:12:38] half walk in with the power of the
[1:12:41] resurrection and all of the sudden all
[1:12:44] of the sudden everything is taken away
[1:12:47] from you and you feel nothing and you
[1:12:49] feel no power and you feel no presence
[1:12:52] of the Holy Ghost and you feel you're
[1:12:53] alone and you know all the demons from
[1:12:56] hell are coming to attack you. You are
[1:12:59] feeling hopeless and helpless but you
[1:13:02] are not trusting in your own
[1:13:04] understanding. You are not trusting in
[1:13:06] your own strength. You are trusting in
[1:13:08] the word of God.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; That that that's my Jesus.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It looked like he was being
[1:13:21] defeated, but no, he wasn't being
[1:13:22] defeated.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He was doing that
[1:13:26] because that was written in the word of
[1:13:29] God about him that he was going to
[1:13:31] suffer like that, that he was going to
[1:13:33] die like that. But he had to believe the
[1:13:35] word that when he died, he was not going
[1:13:38] to stay in hell for more than three
[1:13:40] days. That he was going to be raised
[1:13:42] again.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; And he believed the word. He didn't feel
[1:13:46] the presence of God anymore. Can you
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; sometimes I feel like that. I don't know
[1:13:53] about you, but sometimes I feel like the
[1:13:55] presence of God is not with me anymore.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And that's when that's when the faith
[1:14:01] comes in. Amen.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Not when you feel good, not when you
[1:14:04] feel like a like a champ, but when you
[1:14:07] feel defeated, when you feel that you
[1:14:08] cannot come through, when you feel that
[1:14:10] you don't even want to go to church,
[1:14:12] when you feel that you don't even want
[1:14:13] to wake up in the morning.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That's when you say, "Lord, in your word
[1:14:17] is written about me.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take every promise of this
[1:14:23] holy Bible
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make it mine.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how I feel,
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; how good or bad That's right.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; How much the devil whispers in my ear.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; I'm going to listen to the word.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And the message I will restore pri
[1:14:49] showed the gates of hell would be
[1:14:51] against it, but it could not prevail.
[1:14:55] Satan cannot prevail.
[1:14:58] It may look like you're losing, but
[1:15:00] remember you're not.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; The war was won.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; The war was won.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; What do you think he sent us as as a
[1:15:13] seventh the seventh angel with a
[1:15:15] trumpet?
[1:15:17] What do you think the trumpet was
[1:15:18] announcing?
[1:15:20] War.
[1:15:23] It was the last battle to fight before
[1:15:26] the rapture. And you are, you and I are
[1:15:28] going through that battle.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; You and I are going through that battle.
[1:15:33] And it's the battle of the mind. The
[1:15:36] greatest battle ever fought in human
[1:15:38] history. It's been fought right now.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Because every single day we are
[1:15:44] bombarded
[1:15:46] through the phone, through the internet,
[1:15:49] everywhere we go. the radio, the phone
[1:15:51] listens to your conversations.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; You know it's true.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Whatever you say, all of a sudden
[1:15:59] it appears there.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; It shows there.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Satan is bombarding you. He
[1:16:05] wants you. He wants you to feel without
[1:16:09] purpose.
[1:16:14] We spend six, seven hours on the phone.
[1:16:20] No mind,
[1:16:23] no brain,
[1:16:25] no thoughts. Brother says, "Do not put
[1:16:29] your mind in blank because the devil
[1:16:31] will feel it."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And that's what the devil does to us
[1:16:36] when we are on the phone. Our minds
[1:16:39] become blank.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; And when our minds become blank, that's
[1:16:44] when depression comes.
[1:16:47] A lot of kids with depression nowadays.
[1:16:51] Why? Because their minds are blank. Take
[1:16:53] the phone away.
[1:16:55] Give him a little ball.
[1:16:58] Kick him outside.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; I'm bored. Well, now let's pick up the
[1:17:06] trash. Let's cut the yard.
[1:17:09] Let's help mom cleaning the dishes. I
[1:17:12] promise you're not going to be bored
[1:17:14] after this.
[1:17:19] But that's a problem. It's a fight. It's
[1:17:20] a ma mind of a battle of the mind.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. I can
[1:17:28] never stay in in in in my thought.
[1:17:32] I I look at my notes and I'm like, I'm
[1:17:34] going to say this and that and the
[1:17:35] other. And I'm not good at that.
[1:17:39] I'm not good at that. Blessed be the
[1:17:42] name of the Lord.
[1:17:46] In the message in the in the in the thy
[1:17:49] sitarian church H paragraph 74 some of
[1:17:53] them say well the great Catholic church
[1:17:55] has stood the waves why it proves that
[1:17:58] she is a real church
[1:18:01] why is not strange why it's not a
[1:18:04] strange thing to me with the state and
[1:18:06] everything else behind her she could
[1:18:08] exist but was a strange thing is a
[1:18:13] little bunch of is is a little bunch
[1:18:15] that's pulled off, the little minority
[1:18:18] kicked out, thrown in jail, sawed to
[1:18:22] pieces.
[1:18:24] And we're seeing it in Iran. We're
[1:18:26] seeing it in China. We're seeing it in
[1:18:29] North Korea and other places
[1:18:33] where they cannot stop the believers.
[1:18:36] They can't
[1:18:39] because it doesn't matter what you do to
[1:18:40] a believer.
[1:18:42] There is a seed of God that the devil
[1:18:45] cannot take away.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; How did they ever exist?
[1:18:51] Because the spirit of the living God
[1:18:53] moves in their being. And all the demons
[1:18:56] of hell cannot prevail against it.
[1:18:58] Again, all the demons of hell cannot
[1:19:04] prevail against it. You will have f
[1:19:06] fights. You will have battles.
[1:19:09] The demons are going to come and torment
[1:19:10] you.
[1:19:12] But be sure of this. They will not
[1:19:15] prevail against you
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; sooner or later.
[1:19:21] Sooner or later, it has to flee.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; You got to get stung.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; You got to exercise your faith a little
[1:19:31] bit.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Brother says faith
[1:19:35] faith has hair in the chest.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Huh? Faith has muscles.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't give up.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; No. You tell the devil he's a liar.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning and when the
[1:19:51] devil whispers to you, you tell him you
[1:19:53] are a liar.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham spoke to the devil.
[1:19:59] He was driving said the devil was
[1:20:00] sitting there talking to me and telling
[1:20:02] me, you know, God doesn't exist.
[1:20:05] If if if the devil spoke to Jesus and he
[1:20:07] spoke to Abraham, what makes you think
[1:20:08] the devil is not going to come and talk
[1:20:10] to you?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; The devil is going to come and whisper
[1:20:12] to us all the time.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; But we got to know the word.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Because why? Because brother Ram says
[1:20:19] the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:20:22] anywhere
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; under any circumstance.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Any circumstance. You mean to tell me
[1:20:27] that if I slid, the word of God will
[1:20:30] defeat Satan
[1:20:32] under any circumstance? You mean to tell
[1:20:35] me if I am very sick, the word of God
[1:20:37] will defeat Satan under any
[1:20:39] circumstance.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Because the spirit of the living God
[1:20:45] moves in their being. How do they ever
[1:20:47] exist? Because of this, the spirit of
[1:20:49] the living God moves in their being and
[1:20:51] all the demons of hell cannot prevail
[1:20:53] against it. Upon this rock, I'll build
[1:20:55] my church and the gates of hell cannot
[1:20:57] prevail against it. There's the real
[1:21:00] thing. That's what gives the Holy Ghost
[1:21:02] to these Methodist preachers. and so
[1:21:03] forth here. See, it makes them rise up,
[1:21:06] does something to you. It'll never fail.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Never. It will not fail. You know, and
[1:21:15] Isaiah uh 54:17
[1:21:18] says, "No weapon that is formed against
[1:21:20] thee shall prosper."
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; But you have the weapons to destroy the
[1:21:27] enemy.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. 2 Corinthians
[1:21:32] 10:4, for the weapons of our warfare are
[1:21:36] not carnal,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; but mighty through God to the pulling
[1:21:40] down of strongholds. It doesn't matter
[1:21:43] how strong the devil is, what kind of
[1:21:46] hold he has upon you, upon your family,
[1:21:49] upon your children, upon your loved
[1:21:51] ones, upon your husband, upon your wife.
[1:21:54] You have the weapons to take that demon
[1:21:59] down.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; It's a battle.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; It's a battle. You just have to remember
[1:22:07] who's on your side.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Huh? Because look, Saul, look at
[1:22:12] Goliath.
[1:22:14] David, look at God. It all depends on
[1:22:17] who you're looking to looking at.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; If you're looking at at the devil, of
[1:22:22] course, he's bigger than you. Yes. But
[1:22:24] if you're looking at God,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; God is bigger than the devil.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Brother says, "Prayer is the most
[1:22:33] powerful weapon that was ever put in the
[1:22:36] control of human beings.
[1:22:39] He says prayer changes even the mind of
[1:22:41] God.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; So that's that's nothing we have to go
[1:22:47] back to. Prayer.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Prayer.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Christians do two things.
[1:22:54] I learned that from brother Billy Paul.
[1:22:56] Christians do you know here listening to
[1:22:58] him Christian do two things. He said
[1:23:02] pray and read their Bible.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that simple?
[1:23:08] But yet it's hard.
[1:23:11] It's hard. You got to stop
[1:23:15] and think
[1:23:17] and purposely
[1:23:20] purposely
[1:23:23] sit down or kneel down and say, "I am
[1:23:27] going to talk to God."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Or even standing up.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. But say, "I am going to talk to God
[1:23:34] right now because I need to talk to
[1:23:36] him." You have to do, you have to do it
[1:23:40] with purpose. You have to stop what
[1:23:42] you're doing. You have to stop
[1:23:43] everything and said, "I'm going to read
[1:23:45] a chapter a day." Because you know what
[1:23:48] they say, a chapter a day gives the
[1:23:50] devil away. They don't say that, but I
[1:23:52] said it.
[1:23:54] Huh? You read your word, you talk to
[1:23:58] God,
[1:24:01] you're going to start overcoming.
[1:24:04] You're going to see demon after demon
[1:24:07] being defeated.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; One step at a time, one demon at a time.
[1:24:17] I I like I like what the pastor said
[1:24:21] about being free. You know, we come and
[1:24:24] we said, "Brother, please pray for me
[1:24:25] because, you know, I'm fighting, I don't
[1:24:28] know, pornography."
[1:24:31] Then the next time, pastor, come and
[1:24:33] pray for me because, you know,
[1:24:34] pornography left me, but now I'm
[1:24:36] fighting cigarettes.
[1:24:38] Next time,
[1:24:40] no, it doesn't work like that.
[1:24:44] But in order to overcome,
[1:24:46] you have to fill your head with
[1:24:48] something because the smoke, the devil
[1:24:50] will give you smoke.
[1:24:52] The devil will give you any excuse to
[1:24:54] disobey the word of God.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; But you need to pray. You need to pray.
[1:25:00] And prayer changes even
[1:25:04] the mind of God.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Prayer in message expectation. Prayer
[1:25:09] opens the door.
[1:25:12] Prayer. Whatsoever you ask in prayer
[1:25:14] with faith believing you shall receive
[1:25:16] it. Ask abundantly that your joy may be
[1:25:22] full.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's John 16:24.
[1:25:28] See his attack and is this is in the
[1:25:30] message. The greatest battle ever fought
[1:25:33] preaching 62 paragraph 400 from what I
[1:25:36] have here. See his attack. Watch. Listen
[1:25:39] close. This closing his attack is what?
[1:25:43] Disbelieve God's word.
[1:25:47] That's his attack there. Can there can
[1:25:49] you see the greatest battle was ever
[1:25:51] fought? There's only two forces, Satan
[1:25:54] and God. And what is Satan's weapon
[1:25:57] against you? What is his weapon against
[1:25:59] you? Is to try to get you to disbelieve
[1:26:03] your weapon. So now I have a weapon.
[1:26:08] Now I have a weapon.
[1:26:11] But Satan, his job is to make me
[1:26:14] disbelieve my weapon.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Is try to get you to disbelieve your
[1:26:23] weapon. He disarms you. Let's listen
[1:26:26] real quiet now. Listen. If he can if if
[1:26:30] he can get you to disbelieve your weapon
[1:26:34] is equivalent. If he gets you to
[1:26:36] disbelieve that your weapon is not
[1:26:39] strong enough, he has disarm you.
[1:26:49] It's just a book.
[1:26:53] It's just paper with ink.
[1:26:57] But when you read it, it becomes a
[1:27:00] thought.
[1:27:02] And when you speak it,
[1:27:04] it becomes a whirl.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; It becomes an atmosphere.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; It becomes a transforming power.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; That's your weapon.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; You have it.
[1:27:17] If you don't have a weapon, go and buy
[1:27:20] one.
[1:27:23] Don't Don't bring your phone. Uh oh, I'm
[1:27:25] in troubles now.
[1:27:27] That's right. You need to open your
[1:27:30] Bible and read it because your phone has
[1:27:32] a lot of other stuff that you also look
[1:27:35] at. But this word is sacred,
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; holy, pure.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; This is the greatest book that has ever
[1:27:44] been placed in the hands of human
[1:27:47] beings.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Neville, I hope we never
[1:27:53] believe that. Look, he disarm you when
[1:27:56] he gets you to disbelieve the weapon.
[1:27:58] When you lay that down, that finishes
[1:28:00] your fight. You're done.
[1:28:04] Never lay it down.
[1:28:06] Keep it close to your heart,
[1:28:10] close to your mind,
[1:28:12] right? Put it on the walls of your
[1:28:16] house,
[1:28:18] on the entrance of your house, on the
[1:28:20] exit of your house, in your car when you
[1:28:23] go to work. Blessed be the name of the
[1:28:26] Lord. Amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, he disarm you when he
[1:28:30] gets you to disbelieve that weapon. When
[1:28:32] you lay that down, that finishes you.
[1:28:35] That finishes your fight. You're done.
[1:28:37] Hold that weapon. Don't you lay it down.
[1:28:44] We see his unbelief.
[1:28:47] Don't let that weapon down.
[1:28:50] Don't let that weapon down.
[1:28:53] Hallelujah. Because he he says in in in
[1:28:57] the in the in the message the conflict
[1:28:58] between God and Satan preach in 62.
[1:29:02] But God at the beginning gave his
[1:29:04] children an atomic weapon because he's
[1:29:06] the infinite God. Now seeing there was
[1:29:08] going to be a conflict. He already knew
[1:29:10] there was going to be a conflict.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You're going through a conflict.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; He already knew that.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Your conflict, your problem, your
[1:29:18] situation is not taking God by surprise.
[1:29:21] He knows it
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; because he's he's the infinite God. Now,
[1:29:25] since there was going to be a conflict
[1:29:27] and there was going to be a battle, God
[1:29:29] equipped his children with the right
[1:29:32] kind of ammunition,
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; right kind of attack, the right kind of
[1:29:37] everything that they had the need of
[1:29:39] that would sweep them all the way from
[1:29:42] Eden to the rapture.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Was that
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; the word?
[1:29:47] The word and the gates of hell
[1:29:51] will not prevail against it.
[1:29:54] Will not prevail against it.
[1:29:58] Hallelujah. Jesus overcame everything.
[1:30:02] He overcame hell,
[1:30:04] death, grave, every demon. They they
[1:30:09] thought they got him, but they didn't.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; It was just their trap. He was their
[1:30:15] trap.
[1:30:16] Brother Ram says the sting of death.
[1:30:20] You know, Satan plays the sting of death
[1:30:22] in Abel and he killed him. Plays the
[1:30:25] sting of death in every one of the
[1:30:26] prophets and he killed them. He said,
[1:30:28] "This one is going to be same as any of
[1:30:31] them." And he places the sting of death
[1:30:33] and then he tries to get it out. There
[1:30:36] was a problem there.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Huh? This man looked like a man, but he
[1:30:40] was more than a man.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; He looked like he was just a prophet,
[1:30:44] but he was more than a prophet. He
[1:30:46] looked like any other rabbi, but he was
[1:30:48] more than a rabbi.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; He was God on earth.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he veiled himself so much that
[1:30:57] Satan wasn't even sure about it. You
[1:31:00] know, when he tempts him and and after
[1:31:02] Jesus is baptized in the river and sat
[1:31:04] Satan is tempting him, he's asking him
[1:31:07] if you are.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; If you are, why is he not saying that?
[1:31:12] Because Satan doesn't know whether you
[1:31:13] are or not. The only one that knows who
[1:31:16] is seed or not seed is the father.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:28] I'm going to finish reading this.
[1:31:34] This is brotherham praying. Okay.
[1:31:38] I pray God have mercy. No one wants to
[1:31:42] go to the region of the lost.
[1:31:44] No one wants to go down there, Father.
[1:31:47] Far be it from any of us going. Yet down
[1:31:51] in here is a good heart in that person,
[1:31:54] that man, that woman, a man or a woman
[1:31:58] that's charitable and nice and kind and
[1:32:01] has just been deceived by the devil. The
[1:32:04] devil done that. Satan,
[1:32:08] I'm against you
[1:32:10] because you are an enemy of my Lord.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord and we
[1:32:17] are against him.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid.
[1:32:21] Are we against Satan?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; We are against Satan.
[1:32:25] Satan, I'm against you because you are
[1:32:27] the name an enemy of my Lord. You are an
[1:32:29] an enemy of his word. and I charged thee
[1:32:32] by Jesus Christ, the son of God as a
[1:32:36] mortal being, knowing that I have no
[1:32:38] power within myself. I have empowered to
[1:32:40] stop you. I have power to make you to
[1:32:43] make any of these women clean up, any of
[1:32:45] these men that's listening uh to this
[1:32:47] tape or or whatever. I have no way of
[1:32:50] making them clean up. I'm powerless. But
[1:32:53] I but I do have the authority of God's
[1:32:55] word as a servant to preach it and duty
[1:32:58] bound to the to that authority. Neither
[1:33:02] these policemen out out here have a
[1:33:04] power to stop a car, but he has
[1:33:06] authority to do it. And Satan, you might
[1:33:09] as well go to squeaking your brakes
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; cuz I charge thee by Jesus Christ that
[1:33:17] you turn these people loose.
[1:33:21] Now you might saying, "Brother, you're
[1:33:23] just reading." No, I'm believing.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not reading something just to read
[1:33:29] it.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; I'm believing.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; What I'm reading is thus sayeth the
[1:33:34] Lord.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; I'm believing it with all my heart,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; with everything that's within me.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; That when I read this, whoever needs
[1:33:45] deliverance in this place will receive
[1:33:48] deliverance in this place.
[1:33:51] And Satan, you might as well go to
[1:33:53] squeaking your brakes cuz I charge thee
[1:33:56] by Jesus Christ that you turn these
[1:33:58] people loose through the world,
[1:34:01] throughout the world, wherever this
[1:34:04] message may go.
[1:34:07] Oh, I'm so glad that this message came
[1:34:11] my way.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I can go free. I can be
[1:34:16] free. Hallelujah.
[1:34:20] Wherever this message may go, turn them
[1:34:22] loose. I claim them that they are bought
[1:34:26] that they are not their own. They are
[1:34:28] bought with a price. They are the royal
[1:34:31] seed of Abraham, the Lord Jesus.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thou filthy, dirty, stinking
[1:34:38] hypocrite, deceiver of men, leading them
[1:34:40] blindly into the ditches of hell. Turn
[1:34:43] them loose. I charge thee by the living
[1:34:46] God by the sacrifice of his son Jesus
[1:34:49] that you turn them loose that their
[1:34:51] souls may be charged with the with his
[1:34:54] blessings and with his presence
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; that they might possess the gates of
[1:35:00] every enemy.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; You've got them waiting for this.
[1:35:04] Hallelujah. You've got them waiting for
[1:35:07] this that or the other or some holy
[1:35:09] touch or something else. But I'm saying
[1:35:12] you're going to lose your hold.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I'm so glad I believe
[1:35:20] this message, brother.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I am so glad that I am not that that I
[1:35:28] didn't stay in the in the Pentecostal
[1:35:30] church where I grew all the way till I
[1:35:32] was 15 years old.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; I received the message. My dad received
[1:35:35] the message when I was 12. And I began
[1:35:38] to read the books when I since I was 12.
[1:35:42] And I wasn't sure about all of that, but
[1:35:44] something in my heart, something in my
[1:35:47] heart just I don't know. I don't know
[1:35:49] about this man, you know, it sounds
[1:35:52] weird what he's saying,
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; but there's something in here
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; that makes my heart quiver.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That makes me skip a beat
[1:36:01] once in a while. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the living God
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; turn them loose in the name of Jesus
[1:36:10] Christ
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; let them people go.
[1:36:15] May the power of God, the understanding
[1:36:18] of the word as they are washed this
[1:36:21] morning by it. May the understanding of
[1:36:25] keeping God's word and his promise and
[1:36:28] his promises true, a hold that cannot be
[1:36:31] broken by Satan.
[1:36:33] May each one lay a hold of that promise,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; saying, "This is it. I'm holding on to
[1:36:40] it.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; God made the promise.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I'm the seed of Abraham.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; How can I doubt his promise
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; and move right on
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; I don't need to pray.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; I already prayed. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz that prayer
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; is powerful.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; That prayer is powerful.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; If you didn't believe it, go back home
[1:37:13] and read it again.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Because I was I was asking, Lord, what
[1:37:17] can I say? And the whole morning, the
[1:37:20] whole day, I was like looking at this,
[1:37:22] looking at that, looking at old sermons.
[1:37:24] You know, you sermons pile up and I kind
[1:37:27] of look at them like, hm, maybe this is
[1:37:29] good for that brother or that sister.
[1:37:30] No, I'm just saying.
[1:37:32] But but I pray I said, "Lord, Lord, give
[1:37:35] me something.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Give me something not that can touch the
[1:37:39] people, but that can touch me
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; because it touch if it touches me, then
[1:37:44] I know it's going to touch somebody
[1:37:45] else,
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; you know, and and you know, my my my
[1:37:50] wife, my poor wife, she puts with me a
[1:37:53] lot,
[1:37:56] and she was she was there with me the
[1:37:58] whole day, and she was trying to have
[1:38:00] conversations with I was like, "Mm, no,
[1:38:01] no, not right now. No,
[1:38:05] they're going to talk about that stuff
[1:38:06] later."
[1:38:08] But once I began to read this,
[1:38:11] she didn't realize.
[1:38:14] But all of a sudden, something fell in
[1:38:16] that in that room.
[1:38:20] I was holding my tears. I was crying to
[1:38:23] the Lord, but I felt his presence.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; So I know this is the truth.
[1:38:31] Go back and read that prayer
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; and believe it with all of your heart.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:38:40] Listen. It's not vain repetitions.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Don't let Satan whisper that to your
[1:38:47] heart, to your mind.
[1:38:49] That's the say of the Lord right there.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Read it. Believe it
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; for your life,
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; for the life of your children,
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; for the life of your house.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; I even challenge you in the name of
[1:39:04] Jesus Christ to read it out loud in your
[1:39:06] house.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; To play it on the tape
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and tell Satan, "Look at this, Satan.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Look at this promise.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You have no hold over me. You have no
[1:39:18] hold over my family. You have no hold
[1:39:20] over my children because the Lord Jesus
[1:39:23] Christ has delivered us.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; If the musician could come, I tell you,
[1:39:42] I can listen to brother Serger all day
[1:39:44] long.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; I I I certainly enjoy that.
[1:39:49] uh you know
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; we we often time forget that the word is
[1:39:53] our weapon.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; You know what it's it's the very
[1:39:57] overcoming weapon that's been given to
[1:39:59] us and and we have to know it to know
[1:40:02] what he says. We have to know what to
[1:40:05] read it. We have to become one with it.
[1:40:08] You it's it's not a mental exercise of
[1:40:11] memorizing but it's to know what the
[1:40:13] promise says about you. Th this word the
[1:40:17] barbam says in this end time we have
[1:40:20] received the full entire revelation the
[1:40:24] opening of the seals we have receive the
[1:40:26] entire interpretation of the bible so so
[1:40:30] this is not what was it's not a portion
[1:40:34] it's the entirety of it has been made
[1:40:36] known unto us why because we need to be
[1:40:39] overcomers and we need the whole word of
[1:40:41] god to overcome with if one word can
[1:40:44] raise Jesus from the dead, what would
[1:40:46] the whole word of God do?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And and so that's why when the Holy
[1:40:50] Spirit is coming, it's not to quicken
[1:40:53] your thinking. It's to quicken the word.
[1:40:57] I
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; If there's no word in there, it's going
[1:40:59] to quicken frustration. It It's not
[1:41:02] going to quicken frustration. I'm trying
[1:41:03] to say, it's not going to quicken your
[1:41:05] idea of it. No. The Holy Spirit is
[1:41:08] looking for the word. The Holy Spirit
[1:41:10] lives by the word. The Holy Spirit is
[1:41:13] there to take the word and made it a
[1:41:15] reality to the believer.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; So we need to feed the word so we can be
[1:41:20] quickened by that word and become that
[1:41:22] word.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; So so it's very critical. It's not oh I
[1:41:27] I you know like I I love what he said.
[1:41:28] You you bored read. You tired read. I it
[1:41:32] don't matter whatever situation you are
[1:41:35] in read the word of God. Play the word
[1:41:37] of God. Play that message. Let it be let
[1:41:40] let it be filling up your mind every
[1:41:43] time. Don't let any space for anything
[1:41:45] else to get in.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Because when when when time temptation
[1:41:51] will come, you will only speak that
[1:41:54] which is in you.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; If it's frustration, frustration will
[1:41:59] come out. But you want that word to
[1:42:01] remain in there. We want to be
[1:42:03] acquainted. It he will come and take
[1:42:05] that word and quicken it. That's what we
[1:42:08] desire if we can all stand. I I really
[1:42:11] enjoyed it and I trust within our hearts
[1:42:13] we can say Lord quicken the word in my
[1:42:15] heart. You know, and let me say this. He
[1:42:19] talked about the test but says the test
[1:42:22] is the greatest thing that's ever
[1:42:24] happened to you.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; The test is there to prove which one is
[1:42:29] real, which one is not.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And and I don't want to find out if I'm
[1:42:34] real at the end. I want to find out if
[1:42:37] it's real here. I want to find out the
[1:42:39] word will work here. I want to find out
[1:42:42] what's in my heart now. I don't want to
[1:42:44] find out later down the road. And the
[1:42:47] word will come and the test is to prove
[1:42:50] that which is in you. And and often time
[1:42:53] we we look at we have a reaction like oh
[1:42:56] what just happened? What you realize the
[1:42:58] word that's been planted in your heart
[1:43:01] came and a situation came and you just
[1:43:04] cry aba father and and you see him come
[1:43:06] on the scene and show himself. That's
[1:43:09] what we desire. We this word was given
[1:43:12] to us not so it could be something that
[1:43:15] we could just come in externally. No, we
[1:43:17] become one with it as we listen and hear
[1:43:20] it and eat it.
[1:43:24] It's not a book on the shelf that we put
[1:43:26] and you know and we say, "Oh, I have a
[1:43:29] Bible." And and you just pick it up when
[1:43:31] it's service time. No, it's something
[1:43:33] that you become one. You become so
[1:43:35] acquainted with it.
[1:43:38] That everything it is you are. And you
[1:43:41] know that I'm reading about myself. I am
[1:43:44] reading about I'm letting this word
[1:43:46] become my reality. Amen.
[1:43:49] Let's just sing that.
[1:43:53] Oh, and you're alone
[1:43:56] are all
[1:43:59] I need.
[1:44:03] Oh, for you hold my destiny.
[1:44:11] Oh, and you are all I are all I need,
[1:44:18] Lord. And in you alone,
[1:44:23] I am complete.
[1:44:28] Oh,
[1:44:32] me.
[1:44:33] Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] Call me Lord.
[1:44:39] I'll come running after you
[1:44:53] know
[1:44:56] and I'll come running after you.
[1:45:01] Oh, why you're alone?
[1:45:08] If you need prayer tonight, I just come.
[1:45:10] You will be grateful for your whole
[1:45:16] city.
[1:45:19] Oh, and you're alone. I
[1:45:25] need
[1:45:28] in you alone. Oh, and I am.
[1:45:34] Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] Oh,
[1:45:37] draw
[1:45:40] me.
[1:45:44] Lord,
[1:45:47] I'll come running after you.
[1:46:00] Draw me home.
[1:46:04] I'll come right in. I
[1:46:08] for
[1:46:21] I'll come right after you.
[1:46:28] draw
[1:46:30] me. Just ask him to draw you tonight
[1:46:35] to draw you by his word. I'll come
[1:46:38] running after you.
[1:46:43] Oh, there's nothing like the presence.
[1:46:49] Nothing like the presence.
[1:46:53] Nothing like the presence of the Lord.
[1:47:02] Nothing like the presence.
[1:47:06] Nothing like the presence.
[1:47:09] Oh, nothing like the presence of the
[1:47:14] Lord.
[1:47:16] Oh, and I am free.
[1:47:24] Oh, and I am healing
[1:47:32] tonight. Oh, I forgive.
[1:47:42] Oh, and I'm
[1:47:45] all forever in his presence.
[1:47:51] Oh, this time presence

[1:48:56] Oh, and I am here.
[1:49:05] Oh, and I am.

[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I'm
[1:49:25] forever
[1:49:26] in his presence.
[1:49:29] Take a take
[1:49:32] your spirit down on me.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; We're all just like the rain.
[1:49:43] Saturate
[1:49:46] my thirsty soul.
[1:49:49] Come and fall aresh on me.
[1:49:55] Fill my cup again.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Oh heal my heart
[1:50:03] and make me glory.
[1:50:08] Oh, I need
[1:50:10] you now. Oh, pour your spirit
[1:50:15] out.
[1:50:17] Oh, and pour your spirit out on me.

[1:54:43] Maybe they can't muster enough faith to
[1:54:45] believe.
[1:54:50] Lord, you've made us believers tonight.
[1:54:59] Lord,
[1:55:00] as a brother read that prayer
[1:55:05] and the prophet said, "Wherever this
[1:55:06] tape may go,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; it found a resting place here tonight.

[1:55:39] devil,

[1:56:08] minds, Lord, we can once again just
[1:56:13] intend
[1:56:15] to do more for your kingdom. Lord, to
[1:56:17] read more, to pray more, to draw closer

[1:56:29] we just bear the burdens and put them
[1:56:30] before you, combine our faith, Lord, and
[1:56:33] know that you'll answer according to
[1:56:35] your word and your will. Lord, we pray
[1:56:38] that each of us as we leave here can be
