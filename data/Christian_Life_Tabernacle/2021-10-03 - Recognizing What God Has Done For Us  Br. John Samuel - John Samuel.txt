Description:
Recognizing What God Has Done For Us
Br. John Samuel
Sunday Evening Service: October  3, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

amen father what a privilege just beyond our comprehension of the love that you had for us that while we were yet sinners you went to calvary without sin in your life without spot without wrinkle even the testimony said which among you can convince me of sin and yet father with us in you us on your mind you went and paid such a wonderful price that when our arrival came that you could look on us as redeemed and forgiven and resurrected and share yourself with us oh god it's in my heart i just overwhelms me that you picked me father and i know each believer here feels the same way father you

[Music] [Music] ah [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh man [Music] [Applause] is good [Music] if we are here tonight it's because god gave us a revelation amen amen all those that didn't receive the revelation to come here tonight they are not here and because it's not just a happen chance it was let's read in first john first john chapter one let's start from verse five [Music] i told the pastor were trying to make it in time but there was a lot of traffic so i didn't get time to print out my quotes even when i got here oppa king in the parking lot yeah there's a brother who told me man first somewhere brother tammy it seems like you're driving a little fast fared away i said yes brother man i said it was just god because i could have made i could have been here and i was praying to god poor police that the police may not stop me [Music] alive because i had two choices either show up late by the police or to be started by the cops measured to radiate the two i said you're a god of all things you're a god of time if there are people that have to obey the law the first ones are christians i have to read [Music] this is then is the message which we have heard from him and declared unto you that god is light and in him there's no darkness at all sino di nusam [Music] if we say we have fellowship with him fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in like in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from from all from all sin let's pray and everyone that's gathered here tonight you know they know they don't need a man they need you yourself the lord the holy spirit they want is see your face they want to see you come and speak to them in that manner lord i put myself aside and i invite the power of the holy [Music] yourself you the holy spirit that you may dwell in me and speak to your i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ our lord amen you may have your seeds [Music] it's been a while that it fits a while that you haven't uh spoken to the people let me see ministers knows what i'm about to say we have our confidence in one thing alone say jesus and that's in jesus jesus himself because when we are here we have i felt like we could have just continued tonight because we were in the same spirit he could have just carried on amen amen what i'm saying has to be israel because i know everything we see here at the pulpit will be asked of us one day we could say a lot of things but that's why it's important that we we we cling to the word because one day they will be asked and say brother samuel you said such giant predication i heard the preaching and the teaching i i said i felt that was the same thing that was in my heart because when the pastor comes in when he asked me to pray i was asking myself what am i going to say i want to speak on uh recognizing what god has done for us amen amen recognizing it means when someone has done something for you jesus has done something of ver of of great value it's done something of great value for us as we read the bible and as we know we are christians the appellate command since the beginning god created a man he created feminine because adam had both the male and this uh the female spirit hallelujah hallelujah and then there came a time where god separated them and we saw there was a time where adam was in the divine presence of god every whatever adam could speak all of it was the word wicked one came amen amen and and men fall from there me but because god and you is god [Music] and he wanted fellowship with man in this plane there was something that was set aside god did something for us in other words i don't want to say he did something but he revealed what he did what he had in mind for us because the scripture tells us before there is death the resurrection was already there before there and death came into man but what god did at that time he revealed his plan eternal eternal life to man he said man this was my plan amen amen god did something for you that's why when you walk young people has to notice that you have received something from god amen amen we can't even say much because we have the prophet of the hour who's told us all these things anything that's outside of the prophet of the hour that's the devil amen amen i want to read the communion communion by the reconciliation of the blood it was preached on may may 5th 19 and 55. it's amazing amen okay um yeah yeah yeah no it's fellowship through the blood sorry yeah yeah yeah i found that yeah uh paragraph tense paragraph 15. amen now fellowship men i says felt now fellowship man wants the greatest fellowship that men could ever have is fellowship with christ i love to meet man man we all love to fellowship with uh to fellowship with all one another sometimes we go out to have a bike to eat neighbor neighbor woman talked across the fence coming around having a little parties it says where they meet together fellowship amen amen man because there's something within them about fellowship everything that we are doing is based on what was at the [Music] because within men there's something about fellowship amen amen but the the fellowship that god is asking is not the communion within or the fellowship between men and men is when it's in the presence is it says is in the presence of of the mighty god no fellowship could take its place when man is under the leadership of his own lord the lord jesus amen amen when man is in fellowship with god it but you are not in fellowship with your god almighty there's going to be something missing but when you have fellowship with god you are in the complete in the security complete security at one time man had perfect fellowship with god that was god's purpose that's the reason it craves the that's the reason it's a crave in your heart is the longing for something a contact if we try to have fellowship separate he made it so that there will be communion between the creator and the one he created and when you are in the perfect fellowship let's go to verse 17. separate but then when a man began to sin he separated himself from his fellowship with his maker sin is what separated him as that as that's the truth which we believe it is the bible only speaks the truth and if that's the truth then if there is some separa there is some separation made for sin then man through the preparation can come back in perfection fellowship and harmony with his maker again you believe it that's right can he says we can only find the way that's when we want to find the remedy amen we cannot just go and say well when men fall when men fail this happened no we have to go back to the plan of god because that's where we rip the benefits let's go to paragraph 19. japan i think that adam and eve was the most perfect couple that ever walked on the earth i can see adam in his not a great shoulders like like some barn doors but a perfect built man [Music] [Music] amen it said eve beautiful i can see her now as she she woke up after the operation from adam and she looked a and and he looked at her her beautiful hair hanging down her back her eyes sparkling like the stars about adam touching her by the flesh and said she's flesh of my flesh and born of my born beautiful never to fade out those lips they wouldn't they wouldn't have they wouldn't have to use uh this here manicure or or what what the what the stuff you put on uh on your face now to make themselves uh look pretty it says sync synth caused you to do that god made it perfect amen amen adam and eve was in perfect fellowship with god they were all beautiful you know they published one they say they didn't need manicure to paint their faces they didn't need to put things on their lips so the husband can find them attractive the beauty that we have when we are in fellowship with christ the natural beauty that we have when we are in fellowship [Music] pal uh you may be pale amen amen if you feel my face i shouldn't look attractive in all those things and i can speak to that to the our sisters or to the young lady and sisters because they are the type of the church amen amen is the one who tries to look beautiful to him it's the church who's the bride of christ the church wants to look pretty in memphis but god tells the word of god is it's not the printing oh the word of god is whatever you put on your face it's the redemption the painting is the word of god if you want to put the red sticks the lipstick on your lips when you come before christ he looks at you seriously from my it says oh she's really pretty basically why because before god man and women we are all women because we have one husband who is christian amen amen amen and today we find there's so much trouble in the church the problem is and what is the problem people take a lot of makeups instead of taking the word of god and to use it the fifa parallel delay to live the word of god the the word of the hour amen amen and the word of the hour our amen amen just excuse me i'll just speak the word of god the word tells us if you want another husband that's the that's the the the characteristics of the husband amen amen amen amen and as the woman because the bride has to have the characteristics of of jesus and the characteristics of jesus because in the beginning the word was with god and the word was god amen amen sometimes we ask in the church why don't we see that why don't we see that what's the problem the problem say my man the problem is me the problem is not the pastor the problem is not the pulpit the problem is me hallelujah amen why is why am i not seeing this is it written in the word of god why am i not seeing this is in line with the world came with a manifestation of the power of god let there not be snow anything hallelujah amen you're not manifest there will be a manifestation focus why because you have the word the word tells us that the word of man everything that we it this is a local church so i feel i feel like liberty where you can speak freely is at home hallelujah amen that god made a place where people were gathered that's why when we build the church oh that's why the church is dedicated when it's built we're going to come meet together it's a place where we're going to come and meet with god amen amen and do we believe god will speak in vain no no right when god speaks he speaks the problem is us man or not even by ourselves we we we come to a place where we can't receive a monster and eat at transformative and transform our lives book of life before the foundation of the world who takes care of everything it's not me my friend brother to you are you no responsibility revelation book of symbols paragraph 20. sometimes you may have a thought leaning towards election amen amen it's good that we are here by election day it's because god elected us that's why we are here but it doesn't mean because we're elected we can do whatever we need we want to amen amen and that's the reason why that's why i turn away this morning for prayer because this time you see here jeffrey i'm hitting really hard on the election and i feel like i need to get away from it for a little bit because you would think [Music] we and i want to get away from it for a little bit because one would say brother branham uh the election it says yes he god calls by election yes i can do what pleases me yes it doesn't mean election at all amen amen please that means you were not even elected to begin with amen amen if you stay at home because you are elected because i never seen someone who gives you money hallelujah to open the door yeah lord i'm definitely and to go and meet the person because you know it's money but that money is nothing the word tells us jesus jesus christ who came to die for us you know he didn't have a reason to die amen hallelujah hallelujah it's by his law didn't know he says no come on the when the word tells us that we are redeemed by the blood palestine it's not the physical blood it's not the chemicals that's the word of the hour heaven amen hallelujah [Music] to stay at home the day that we have services is against the word of god amen amen i'm going to read and in fact you would think about god how that he loved you when you were unlovable amen amen god loved us when we were unlovable but god came and said no feast it's my son so when he pulls it's my bride i'm going to come and die for her and the word reveals to us what that grace that we have today it's without money without anything to be bought with unto them they're not asking you to pay money to the pastor they don't know that you don't have to pay it's just to accept the word of god and before you have anything to do with it he chose you come it seems like it brings it takes the election so high so that is to think that when i was unlovable he loved me to think that when there was nothing i could do ilma pre ill mass of it he took me and he saved me parsagras by his grace recognizable [Music] i surely should should be grateful enough to serve him and to love him amen amen if we can really feel within ourselves to know that it's truly by election we were elected and chosen and if god came and came and gave us this privilege that we have we have to serve it we have to serve him even more [Music] oh uh fellowship fellowship through the uh redemption fellowship by redemption event okay now when god had them in his presence in his perfect control they walked with him and talked with him in the garden but as as soon as he lost his fellowship with god he became a wanderer wandering around no place to go tossed about that's the way man has become today here it is now listen when a man comes out of fellowship with god he becomes a wanderer he he going about joining one church and leaving to another joining another it don't satisfy him here he goes he goes over to the uh amen amen but what happened over there ah no young flirty mafia oh there's a brother who did this this this to me in the through the past satisfaction you see he won't find satisfaction here he virtually methodists he will go to the methodist methodist university baptist and the from the methodist he goes to the baptism and then he will go to the pentecostal to the pilgrimage the because he's lost fellowship fellowship with god but they take the word to preach to themselves in instead of preaching jesus amen but they're preaching themselves they're preaching for them you lost a fellowship i kill a problem whose problem is that i kill a problem whose problem is that symbol is maybe the maybe you'll maybe you'll just find the pathetic the problem is probably you amen maybe it's you he says you refuse the church here and then you go to another church and then the other time in another church and then in another church no what a problem where's the problem the answer the prophecy is giving just find fellowship and anywhere is home sweet home you find you'll find a a people at east where the word is not telling you the truth when the word touches your life oh i'm not going there anymore they call you you stop the preaching and you pick up your phone brother it was the place where people were supposed to come to resolve the problems was a place where man when there's conflict within the heart and they're not feeling themselves when they come they then and they come in and god speaks to them through the word but today the church celebrates it's a it's a place where everybody is running away from me there's something that's not right i'm trying to be mindful of time ventura paragraph 23. went through one let's move to 20 25. we have a i used to go to a place an old methodist preacher empathic antique he used to sing a little song the old brother back home he said he said we let down the bars we let down the bars we compromised with sin we let down the bars the ship got out is teaching back to the old hewing line of the shed god laid out of the world a map for the for the human family to go back home it was through the reconciliation of the blood he's never changed from that from the from that day to to this certain days that doesn't mean that much to god you got to be born again you've got to come and recognize the blood that was shared for you and you are dead to yourself to the things of the world and born anew in christ jesus by the washing and the renewing bagless by the blood amen amen pretty straight my friend but brother celebrity it's the truth seneca please it's not for the church the old fashioned hallelujah people all the people are interested is oh it's i i i'm the predecessor of brother branham oh we received the message oh we did this and we're done what is the message doing in you what is justifying the fact that you received the message hallelujah the 20 20 23rd paragraph when they had realized that they had sinned [Music] and throw back the skin to adam and eve they cover themselves with the scheme and stood in the presence of god and to receive to receive the judgment and the eternal destination could not couldn't stand no and that's the same covering today i'm afraid that the full gospel people [Applause] are getting a little far off the track now when you leave that out come back years ago is an old-fashioned simple revival and the old-fashioned paul's revival in the bible holy spirit preached back in the church with the old time conviction yes [Music] men and women coming back to the lord through the shed blood reconciliation a reconciliation reconnaissance wrecking themselves dead in your if people can recognize the evangelist when the the gospel is preached if the gospel preached at the old time revival eventually when we preached the gospel if oppression left until it's preached the god it's the gospel that's being praised el is pre-delivered with the spirit of the of the gospel because the word is being preached in the innocence you can preach outside of the spirit of that word and you take it as a revelation it's not a true revelation you have god in totality amen amen fellowship with god paragraph 49 yeah for the colonists foreign but when a man correctly one time comes in and lays his hands upon the head by faith the lord jesus christ and confesses his sin then the blood of jesus christ the life of the what the life that was that was in him that was the life that was in that was god that was god himself and that man the life that returns to that man after he has confessed their sins and accepted christ he is brought into a relationship with christ by the baptism of the holy ghost and there is no moral desire in his heart to sin amen that's why that's the reason hebrew 10 says for the worshiper once purged the worshiper once purged has no more conscience of sins consciousness of sins there you have fellowship the things of the world is dead you don't recognize it no more you recognize yourself and your life is hid in god through christ celebration sealed by the holy spirit and then you look to the things to you and you are looking to the heavenly things other you couldn't hardly sit in the church 10 minutes sometimes you could only stay not more than 10 minutes in the church but when you really got the holy spirit you can sit in the church day and night basketball people always there's premonday i was the people has worldly spirit elephant legless they come to church amen amen is oh there's about 45 minutes now let's see if it's going to go another two minutes you go out it means something in you monk is missing civilization if you are hungry everyone so you can really be ready to eat and find a

water to all the cameras i don't have time to go the [Music] to the children of israel they have everything they had a prophet and i'm not saying the rapture has already happened amen amen but the word tells us it was preached to us the other time there's three phases to the rapture yeah there's the there's the shout of the god of what i'm talking about it's the shout that's going forth and that's the preaching you are coming forward spiritually and it will be very easy to the pastor they didn't know of analysis to say oh come to church memphis even if there is corona we don't know i'll say no basket because there's a man of god speaking i will have to go let's move i'll tell you something that's why the prophet even preached to us the respect to the servants of god when a servant of god says something amen amen in fact if it's your pastor and you you are called to believe it amen amen i didn't say that whom god she was very kind she was happy i'm going to go meet my sister i'm going to go meet my brother and when we come to church in you there has to be a spirit of joy there it has to be a cry within you amen i need something ship is where they need something i need something and that thing that you need is nothing but the word that's why the word the church [Music] the the camels it was the camel that transported her to meet gome and meet their husband the word of god that we are serving it's the same god the same word that brings us in the presence of god hallelujah hallelujah jesus i chose to be a little bit longer yeah i know it's not my nature but i hope you understand just to wanted to make sure that i it's understood the pastor told me that this was communion right so i'm going to stop here i'm going to read this and stop why are we not a denomination um countries yeah i preached in 1958 september 27th 11th excuse me if i'm a little bit long we can say why we are not taking communion we can say why we are taking communion we'll tell you why we take feet washing why we won't let the members take take it i've been going from one member to another vusave yeah where you've been having little faces jesus you that has taken the blessed cup of god what they see they said hotels across this altar you that are called brothers and sisters and then go on and take the telephone echo and get off about one another you are not fit to be called christian when you are when you are that way certainly right right the telephone you keep off them telephones god is going to hold you responsible as long as that kind of spirit is in you you you know if a man is wrong i'll ever go so negligence no wonder god can't discipline his church because you are not doing it right instead of getting on the television and talking about this one the group is still a dot and what taken place and little cult and so forth around like that instead of doing that why don't you do what the bible says see unfair ayat april unfortunately if a brother has been overtaken he did me i don't care what he did i let go to him come here anyway he didn't say for him to come to you go to him amen may god bless you amen some good abc preaching huh that we certainly need you know i don't want you to misunderstand uh brother john you know you should never take my words just because of my office you understand that's not what he's saying because you would never be called out if you understand so that's not what he's saying but what he's saying is is you respect somebody brother brahm said stay with your pastor as long as he stays with the word you understand and uh and that was the great that's the thing we're going to go into next about what brother branham called where the trouble comes is you had balaam who was a vindicated prophet of god and you had moses and the only danger there was is that balaam got the word of god he got the real answer from god but he wouldn't follow it you know what i'm saying so it doesn't matter you've got to watch how it follows you've got to watch what the fruits of it is so it's just not a blanket oh he's the pastor you believe what he says because he has the office i i would never want you to do that the only reason i'd want you to give me one ounce of a grain of salt is that if i'm saying what the prophet of god said that's what we rest in and and i believe the next message is a guide is that right the next one after i think he preaches a message called a guide and that's what we have that's what we all have in common we have the revelation that the lord's come in our day the word of the lord is coming our day to us jesus christ visiting and coming back to the gentile bride veiled in the message of the hour giving us the very word that's going to transform us and put us into that rapturing condition so we're just servants the scripture says you don't lord over god's heritage but you become the servants of the people so i've had many people come to me and the only thing i can do is take you to what the prophet of god said just bring to your remembrance brother braham said this here brother abraham said that there brother brim said that there because really deep inside that's the voice you hear you hear the voice of your bridegroom and i i liked something that rather john samuel he said in the sight of god we're all female and that's that's true because there's neither male nor free male nor female june or greek bonder free but we're all christ and christ is god's god bless you if the brothers would go prayer for communion uh we'll try to i know the alexanders are with us and that they have a long way home and and so we don't want to have them drive too much in the dark if it gets dark we'll drive you home and take care of you all right so lord bush let's stand together and let's turn in the gospel of saint luke and the 14th verse of the gospel of saint luke the 22nd chapter and the 14th the brothers should prepare for communion we'll move right into communion service it says in the 14th verse of luke the 22nd chapter it says and when the hour was come he sat down and the and the twelve apostles with him and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it amongst yourselves for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave it unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this dew in remembrance of me and likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table and truly the son of man goeth as it is determined but woe unto him that man by whom he is betrayed so even you notice that even the great challenge that the lord jesus faced you know and and that's truly what we don't we don't want to betray the purpose of these things so that the brothers would come we'd ask them blessing upon our gracious heavenly father lord this bread that is set before us that is a representation of the sacrifice that you give us and as our brother preached that he done something for us and then we receive what he's done and now our appreciation is manifested that what he has done should show up in our lives and father we take this communion tonight that we can come back into fellowship with you there's healing and communion lord our our brother brother miriam father he needs a healing touch in his body father he we know that that the there's cancer in his phone but yet father he's here tonight because he wants to take communion lord and so we ask that you would look upon him father with favor and father you would touch his suffering lord that this that's in his bones father he's walked many years with you at 85 years old father that you would give his body comfort then rest father we don't care if the cancer remains father if it has no effect on him we raise our hands and we glorify you father for you have an appointed time for him but father we ask that you remove the pain and the suffering father satan has no rule of his body because he's given his life to you and father this bread here represents that father for there's healing in communion and father this cup that's here this wine representing the stimulation of revelation that comes in our lives it was shed for us father that the life of the sacrifice did come back into the believer father we asked we become more dedicated this evening that we would take the responsibility of our election father seriously we would understand that of all the people of this world you chose us not to go into judgment father may we live as if we believe that may we let our life shine that others might see but that they might inquire of what's the hope that's in us that they too might possess this election father we act that you'd move upon our congregation father may be pleasing father those of us who are not living up to the standard that we should be living to we ask for mercy upon them father and forgiveness father that you'd send your spirit by to instruct them and father make them a way of their way of their ways father that they may turn their hearts back to you father we don't want to leave one here we want to take every single elected son and daughter of god when we go and we ask it we're not going to leave any behind be like abraham oh god rescuing life we ask it in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated
