have a desire to be in the house of God it should be our desire and so often we hear messages from the pulpit that encourage us to do more and be more and some people just don't get it um but this is it I mean all that this is going to be on the test so if you want to pass the test you need to be found faithful in the house of God you need to be found doing the things that God requires to do I've only been here like a couple of years and I probably offended somebody and if I have forgive me of I love all of you and if I did it I did it not willingly but every now and then I slip and fall and I say and I do the wrong things but I love you and I pray that we would be a church that God is calling for in this last day we need to have a burden for something you know if like brother Birmingham said if not for a man hey find a dog or a cat to love but you need to have a burden for something and once God places that burden on your heart you'll do so much better because you'll forget about yourself and you'll look for the needs of others let us look to God In Prayer Heavenly Father we come tonight Lord God in the precious name of Jesus we want to thank you this morning Lord God for the

capacity but we pray and ask even now Lord God that you would just look down from heaven and look beyond our faults and and find our needs help us to hear the messages that have come across this

we'll refer to more but this is in in Matthew the 24th chapter and the 35th verse and the minute you see it you'll say oh I knew that right all right it says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away father we ask you to bless your word to us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated this evening we we certainly won't be long tonight we all hope you enjoyed them sermon this morning from our brother from Cameroon and and uh encourages you to be fruitful and uh and I want to talk about that from another side of it because I think we all want to be fruitful I think we all want to do something for the kingdom of God but I've I've had this little message on my heart and it says sermon title I've always kind of wanted to preach um and it just is something that's comforted me through the years and I call it the secret gardener the the secret gardener and and so we we want to approach it and and we're going to read a few scriptures but when we we speak about it much about us being the seed of God and we know the scripture talks to us and refers to us as being the the seed of God the that we have that seed of God in our heart that the sower went forth and he planted a seed a much through the scripture is uh spoken about the the the harvest and the sowing and the reaping and uh and it it brings to us the realization that if we could place ourself in the picture and understand uh the what's transpiring even in our lives that in our lives we have a secret gardener and so when God planted a seed and you know you are the seed that was planted and the seed that was planted he planted it with an intention so the seed that's planted is planted with the intention of the planter so if if you're going to sow a seed or have a garden or plant a seed it wouldn't be just random uh you might plant a seed not knowing what it is but that really wouldn't make you a gardener or a husbandry you know what I made I like riding around with Matthew and saying what kind of tree is that what kind of trees that and you know he'll say that's a sick Sycamore and I said is that the name of the tree no it's a sycamore that's sick or you know it's this kind of tree it's a plum tree he he knows the trees because uh so a husbandry somebody that's a planner that's a gardener when he plants a seed he he doesn't plant it to see what it is what kind of seed is this so I'm just going to plant the seed and see what comes up if that would be the case then he wouldn't know what he planted next to what but we know that the scripture tells us in the parable that the master planted good seed and the enemy came in and he sowed other seed and then they came back to him and said master I thought you sowed good seed so the master knows what seed that he sows and he knows the intention for what that he sowed it now sometimes we don't know that okay so this is what I I want I sometimes I see people get so anxious or or so full of anxiety that they they don't feel they're doing anything for God or they they don't uh they they don't quite know where they are or or they're they're they they don't know how to judge themselves you know to determine whether or not I'm in heaven or not and I always think of that little lady that that the program tells the story about that work on the ranch she said he said the closer that he got to her the more unworthy she felt but the closer he got to her the more that was what he desired and she didn't see no Beauty in herself she didn't see no character in herself but but there was a humility about her and a graciousness about her and and diligence about her and a persuasion about her that this Rancher's son thought that's that's what I'm looking for and so we we will have that tendency and we'll feel that way many times about ourselves but yet God planted the seed and he planted it with an intention and the the fact that the enemy has come in and and we know it's so bad seed and it so tears and many times we see those tares growing up all around us uh our Prophet even preached a message about how these tares reach out and they try to deform us and they try to pull us and pull us aside and uh and even in that sermon I think many times people missed so much of what the messenger was trying to tell him he was trying to tell them you know all these tares and all these doctrines is deforming the church it's making the church into something that it's really not it's pulled him from this side to that side but yet there he was standing the secret gardener and that's what the gardener does the gardener Roots up the tares it it it it it takes care of the seed if it if it's it looks out after it and and nourishes it and takes care of it so let's just look at a script a few scriptures tonight and let's look in first Corinthians 3 7-9 I'll be hearing First Corinthians 3. [Music] um see if I have it here do I get it yeah three seven and nine see if I over here no that's not what it is oh well let me know all right oh no it is seven and nine okay I was looking in two okay here it says three it says he says I have planted an Apollos watereth but God giveth the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but God gives the increase now he that planet and he that watereth are one every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor for we are laborers together with God and ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building and and I think this gives us a great comfort because he says you are God's husbandry in other words you're the god you're the seed that God's planted okay one might water it one might do it but it's God's job he's the husband Tree he's the secret Gardener that is going to do and take care of your life and mold your life in and take care of the circumstances and deal with the situations in your life actually he can provide circumstances he can withdraw circumstances he can have challenges he can he can do all the things that he does secretly that we don't even know what's transpiring because he's a secret Gardener his ways are Beyond finding out he works in mysterious ways but our comfort is that he planning it and if he planted it he planted it for a purpose and he's the one that that when he says you're his husband Tree you're his garden you're his seed your your he's going to take care of you he's going to get you to the place that and to the condition and to the fruits that he planted you for because he keeps secret and so many times we don't understand a lot of things that that goes on in our lives why did this happen why did that happen why did I you know meet this people why did I get in this business why did I waste that why I mean the questions are never ending you know what I mean and and you can't you can't figure all those things out I mean after the all the years that I've lived you know I'm not ancient but I've got a few years behind me I don't think I'm old yet I might be in middle age but uh how many things has he got me out of how many situations the things that I've gotten involved in and and he shut the door on it or he opened the door all things happening in my life that that I can't explain you know but yet they're driving me they're they're they're directing my path because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord we don't feel we're righteous our righteousness into this filthy rags but he's deemed you you are saying he planted you that that's the beauty of part of it he knew the soil that he planted you in he knew everything about you and now he sits back as the secret gardener and he begins to weed your life he begins to fertilize your life he begins to do all kinds of mysterious things in your life things are happening to you that you don't know and if you find yourself from one place to the other and you don't know how you got there that's because there's been somebody working behind the scenes all the time and the Beautiful Thing about it is that he's not going to let it be barren or unfruitful now there are seeds that are planted that that aren't Barren and fruitful but not his garden because he can't fail he can do anything but fail took if he planted you and then you might look at your home situation you might look at this and that and all these things around you and it might try to raise a question in your heart and in your mind because you don't understand the circums the circumstances around you but if you know that there's a secret gardener there's somebody that's looking out after it he's taking care of it you might not know he's there but he's letting the he's opening the irrigation line and and he's throwing the he's fertilizing it in and he's killing the bugs and and the pesticides and putting the the different things out and he he sits over it and he's the one that gives it the increase because he's a secret gardener you may not you know I like the the what the brother brought out this morning many times we don't think about the fact that we've got a guardian angel you know and and he's The Gardener's helper you know so the when when we can sit back and and rest and know wait a minute I'm not the one that is bringing these fruits to pass they're not my fruit they're his fruit they're not the fruit of my labor they're the fruit of his labor to that that he's mindful of me he's mindful what he planted he's mindful of his intention even the scripture tells us that we're foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them well that's the work that he's taking care of that's the work that he's the husbandry of The Gardener of he's going to nourish it he's going to keep it he's going to prune it oh we don't like pruning but he'll he'll prune you to make you more fruitful he's not going to let you be barren you know don't don't don't don't let uh I I just can't say don't don't don't let fear choke you out that that's what he said when those guys that he gave him a talent and they wouldn't do nothing with it and he said man if he'd even have given it to exchanger you know what I mean but so if you could get to the place where you understand wait a minute this pressure isn't on me he's the husband Tree he's the one that gives the increase one might have told me I might have heard the gospel but when it comes to the husbandry of it when it comes to the increase of it my secret Gardener is what gives the increase how did you get here today tonight Brother David to stand right in this pulpit and just read these scriptures and have this few minutes of Fellowship he did he's the one that's guarding me he's the one that caught me out of California he's the one that put me through Montana he's the one that brought me through Arizona he's the one that brought me here and I don't know if this is my final stop you know what I mean but he does he knows where he wants to take me he knows what he wants to do with me and and he works in ways that I don't know because he Gardens in secret he's a secret Gardener He's doing things he's dealing with my heart he's dealing with my mind you know a lot of times you got to go through things to get stuff out of your head you know you get you got Junk up there and and you know he might have to drag you to the left or drag you to the right just to bring an understanding but nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand because you're his you're his garden you're his word you're what he spoke way in the beginning he spoke you're the name that's on the Lamb's Book of Life you're identified with that name that new name that he has for you you're you're identified with that name your fruits pure your your outcome is identified with the words that he spoke because heaven and earth will pass away but my words won't pass away and how many times we heard our messenger say you are the word of God you're what's been spoken all the scriptures are about you but you're the actual reality the word doesn't just set out here the words got to be made flesh all God's word is made flesh it's all real and and if he's he's trying to do anything for us he's trying to get us to the place that we understand wait a minute I I'm not running this boat it there I have a secret gardener I have one that comes in and plucks things in my life and puts things in my life he adds things to my soil you know he might he might put something next to me that well well cause me to struggle more for my survival you know he he he's he's marvelous at what he does but he's got a plan just think of him looking down on all of us tonight and knowing what we have need of before we ask knows all our troubles knows all our weaknesses those all our doubts knows all our secrets there's nothing hid from him he knows what you have need of even before you ask it I mean eventually you come around to asking it and but he's already got it on the way because because he's actually looks at us and I wanted we could use the terminology as a Shepherd but I I just thought of this secret gardener this one that's supplying every need that we have even when we don't know it he works in secret he's bringing us to something he's bringing us to a character he's bringing us to a place he's got to bring us to that thing what he planted for because he's the lord of the Harvest yes he's the lord of the Harvest he sends workers into the Harvest we know many parables about that but eventually the lord of the Harvest comes himself to take the to take the fruit of it and and we even know the parable he says that that they killed the servants and then they then he even sent his son but one time the lord of the Harvest the whose Harvest it is he comes to get the fruit of it amen and that that's what's so beautiful him being the lord of the Harvest it's like him being the judge jury and the attorney all at one he pleads this case he judges his case and he gives the judgment on it and that's what the secret Gardener is he he he's he's not going to lose he's not going to fail you you you're totally you you can become totally confused you can be full of doubt you can be full of discouragement you can have that's just spiritual aphis it's all it is you know what aphis is right I think I said it right anyway it's a little thing that eats on you we all got a lot of things that eat on us but don't forget the gardener he's been given charge of your soul Jesus was the kinsman redeemer he came he was so loved God so loved his children he so loved his garden he so loved the seed that he planted that he sent his only begotten son and he gave him charge over it and he's not going to fail because he's your Redeemer so he's going to secretly guard in your life he's going to secretly I I don't my vocabulary only has the this one word but manipulate your life I don't mind being manipulated by him I don't like being manipulated by others but if if he needs to do things to get me to where I need to be praise God you know what I mean he'll do it and he'll do it without me knowing it he'll do it in secret I'll make a transition all I used to feel this way and now I don't feel that way anymore I used to just like this person now I like him who's doing all that it's the secret gardener he's got control he's not going to lose a one that's what's so beautiful he is going to tend to his seed day and night we can read this the great scripture found in Luke the 13th chapter The Book of Luke and we see this same parable here unfolding him and Luke it says the few scriptures for that are tremendous scriptures I I've purpose in my heart someday to study 13 1-5 out in deeper text but he's as he spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereof and found none then said he unto the dresser of the vineyard behold these three years I'd come seek fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumberth it in the ground and he answered and said unto him Lord let it alone for a year also and I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well if not then after that thou shalt cut it down and and we see that that that's what he does because that's what he is he said oh this this thing's is not fruitful you know I mean it's not bearing fruit it's not getting where he says we I he just doesn't chop it down no but he's gonna go it's his you know I mean it's his three this guy didn't want that tree to be Barren and unfruitful he didn't want that tree not to produce nothing he didn't want it just to have encumbered the land so he he if he didn't have faith that what that he was going to do to that tree would work he wouldn't have wasted his time he says let me have it then if it don't happen really what he's saying let me take care of it I'm the husbandry of it when you come back in a year you'll find fruit on it because he doesn't want you to be Barren and unfruitful and and our brother challenged us this morning about doing something for God about being being unfruitful well I want you to know if that's your heart's desire then there's a secret gardener that's going to go to work to bring that to pass and do whatever he has to do to make you fruitful we even know in the church age book he says sometimes God takes a vessel and he's got to completely break it down and remold it again and make it just the way that he wants it with nail scarred hands the chastisement is impeasable correction's not fun but the secret Gardener's there because he's going to get the result now I rest in that when I rest and I look in the mirror and I go oh no this guy there and that mirror is not going to make it I know there's somebody else I know there's a secret garden or somebody that's working behind the scenes that's working in ways that are unfindable that could do in mysterious ways with tender hands everything just come into path there's nothing happening in my life that doesn't have a purpose or an outcome sometimes it's a test if I fail he'll teach me what I need to know to pass it next time amen he's the husbandry he's the husbandry man he's going to give the increase well he might have someone preach a sermon he I might have someone sing a song he might have all these different things that that go on somebody at work speak yeah many many different ways that God talks but yet he's going to give the increase it's his crop it's his flock another great scripture I think is in Isaiah 27. I like this scripture he's and he speaks here he says just a short scripture but I love it it says the Lord do keep it I will water it every moment lest and he heard it I will keep it day it night and day that's what he promised he said I the Lord will watereth day and night I'll keep it he's he's he has purposed in himself not to fail amen he has purposed in himself when he planted Paul here on Earth there's Saul what did he plant him to be he planted him to be the prophet Messenger to the Gentile age and all of a sudden Paul's coming along doing everything totally contrary and all of a sudden the secret Gardener comes in and says hey it's hard to kick against the prick isn't it little rough this program you've gotten On's a little rough now I'm going to take you I'm going to take over I'm going to take over your life I'm going to start gardening your life I'm going to show you the things that you've got to suffer I'm going to endow do you with power from on high I'm going to give you wisdom I'm going to give you determine I'm going to do it it's my work it's not your work it's The Gardener's work it's the secret Gardener's worth and you've got to know he's working in your life whether you know it or not because he said he would he's doing things he's going to get it done we just get so you know where we've got to see everything we've got to touch everything we gotta smell everything we got to hear everything we got to feel everything but if you could know that the secret gardener wakes up with you goes to bed with you and watches over you at night he will turn your soil if he has to he will spray you with insecticide if he has to he will fertilize you like you've never been fertilized before if he have to but he will make you fruitful and he'll do it and you don't even know it and all of a sudden someday you got a whole complete different attitude and you don't even know how you got from A to B it was that Gardner working in your life weeding weeds out planting seeds you know somebody comes in your mind somewhere down your life's Road and they plant a big old seed there that secret Gardener goes to working sometimes it takes years but he'll get it out because he can't fail and he's a wonderful Gardener I like this because it closed this evening in and so I know that he'll water me day and night I know it's his good pleasure fear not little thought flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom oh really I don't even know when it comes but there's somebody that does you know just if you could just settle that in your heart and understand that you have a secret gardener now why is he secret because he comes in when you don't know he said the spirits like the wind listeth you don't know where it comes or where it goes he's he if forgive my vocabulary but he does his own thing right that's what makes him Secret amen he he works in a realm that we can't see we can't touch we can't feel we talked about it the Supernatural and he's working but he's working to bring us you know our brother talked today I thought it was uh good he said well if I go out on the front porch and go to Cameroon you know I say well I'd like to see that you know like if I could put that offering in the building fun you know so but it it's the thought you understand when we understand that we have somebody that's trying to cultivate that faith in us you have somebody that's working on your behalf to cultivate that faith in you you want to see signs and wonders well you can't just go out and act and you know it's just like me saying oh I want to have faith to change this uh water into wine well can it be done yes do we have the power to do it we we do we have the power to go uh speak a world into existence and go live on it but there's a law that governs it you are said so so in in order for me ever to see that happen there's so many things The Gardener would have to do you have to put me in a situation where that's needful you know what I mean it wouldn't be for my own Glory it wouldn't be a show you know what I mean in fact it would be done in such a way that probably nobody had ever known and or seen it but he he would be the one that's gardening it that's orchestrating it that's bringing it the past that's cultivating it that because that's doing it so God's got this church that he planted that he has an intention for and he has a place that it wants to be he's got a power that he wants them to possess he's got a wisdom that Parts but Power apart from characters satanic so one of the first things he's got to do is he's got to cultivate the character he's got to Garden that he's got a husband tree that he's got to bring it and everything's perfect in his time and in a season and he's doing it and it's it's to know that is what's your comfort just to sit back sometime and find yourself in the middle of a storm and say oh this is the secret gardener he's at work on me amen nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand but in his hand he will mold me and make me and convert me Jesus looked at Peter and said oh Peter Satan has desire to Sifty as the sand but I have prayed for you and there's I am I'm your Secret Gardener Peter I'll be there I'll be with you I'll take care of this you're going to make it and I love this Psalm right here psalm 121.
