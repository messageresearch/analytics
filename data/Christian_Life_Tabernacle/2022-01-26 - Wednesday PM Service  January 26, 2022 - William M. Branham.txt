Description:
Wednesday Evening Service: January 26, 2022.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

lord so now come we ask that you would grant to us revelation lord we speak to each heart in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord thank you musicians man if you have your bibles we'll go and do the word of god amen praise the lord i was at the job today for a brief time and someone the homeowner was saying something that struck me and my goodness the world has become so polluted with their own understanding and their own ways it's just striking how people they have to have it their way it's like almost like life is like burger king have it your way but you know what it just struck me how privileged we are that that we have a different spirit you know that we we could come under the headship and the leadership of the spirit of the living god and god can lead us i'm so grateful that aren't you tonight amen and he said something that just struck me he said you know i don't i don't go to church and i don't read my bible and i don't pray unless god actually compels me and moves me and i thought that was good in one way but a lot of times you don't realize how god's going to deal with you after you go to church after you pray and after you read your bible so i don't want to limit god in in what he can and can't do amen so if you have a need let's lay everything else to the side and let's let god speak amen just was thinking you know it's just been a wonderful treat for me personally i've been really ministered here of late and you know i just feel like it's a it's a time of manifestation and and something i wanted to share from my heart just how you know there's something within us there's a there's a there's a satisfying something that is it's it's crying out for fulfillment amen there's a seed of god inside that's crying out for fulfillment and and there's only one thing that that really can quicken that and that's the spirit of god amen and so i just want to speak to you tonight if the lord would permit us is there's a groaning for manifestation amen and if we just go into the word of god in philippians chapter 1. philippians chapter 1 and we'll read verse 6 through 21. just as a reminder we have a youth meeting this friday from six to nine for those of you that can make it we would like to see you then philippians chapter one and verse six it says being confident of this very thing that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of christ jesus jesus christ even as it is me for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart and so much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all year partakers of my grace you know i just started thinking about you know the testimony that paul he's now you know he he's he's experiencing something and and you know paul had a hard road you know and he was going to suffer many things for his namesake amen i just think about how that sometimes in life there's tensions and there's distress but that actually works for a greater weight and glory look at what happened with paul and how i mean we're actually being strengthened by the things that he suffered and what was poured out a life of christ and that's the same thing with you and i hey man so the the trials and the struggles they're not in vain amen he says for god is my record how greatly i have longed for you in all the bowels of jesus christ and this i pray that your love may abound more and more in the knowledge and in all judgment that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be in sincere and without offense till the day of christ amen you may have your seeds amen what a prayer amen i believe in in the prophet's prayer and and you know i think you know it's it's one of those things god works on both ends of the line you know he's praying and then there's got to be something to respond and and you know i just we'll read that through 21 he says being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happen unto me hath fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifested in all the palace and all the other places and many of the brethren and the lord wax confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear amen that's what happens is when you go through something and you you claim the word of god and god brings it to pass you realize that you now become more confident to speak the word of god amen so if that's that's one of the goals in our christian walk is to be able to recognize the tensions the struggles the stresses is that we could take god's promise and watch him materialize it amen there's something that's crying out for that manifestation and you know we don't want to just continue on just being like babes we want to start growing into the place where we recognize like i so appreciate brother randy that i was going to read something that he had said and and uh my goodness you know he said something in his sermon that i'm like that's that's it you know we want to recognize the road we're on and god is reproducing himself in a people amen it was the the word expressed and and now they take take the promises of god and and they apply it in life and now it sparks off a light amen my goodness uh something else and this is just kind of bringing the picture of you know brother billy mentioned this and and it struck me and i wrote it in my notes i thought you know he said he said the truth out of the mouth of god is a righteous judgment and and i tell you that really that really reverberates because in this in this age where people are just once again anointed to do whatever is right in their own sight amen but now the word of god is the very righteous judgment and it came out of the mouth of god and and we're his spokesmen so the very word of god is a righteous judgment and i just think um and then also these are all things that kind of were stirring on my heart it's starting to develop more of a picture of where we're at in time but um i say this like brother david he was speaking about a war that was disguised by prosperity you know we're we're so nourished in the word of god i thank god that you know he he's actually here to do for what we have need of you know it's it's it's profound that the seed of god within us it's calling for an expression it's calling for a manifestation and it's groaning for something because there was something that was lost amen you recognize in life there's there's just an unsettled feeling sometimes and you wonder what is this what is this unsettledness and and mankind had lost their their relationship and fellowship and there was a great chasm a sin chasm and and after that sin man had lost his estate and he began to go inward in his conceits in his considerations and he's not looking out for his fellow man but but there's a people at the end time amen that come in harmony with the original plan the original word where god and man now actually it's not about just uh what can i do and and my plan and my desires but it's now harmonizing with lord what is your will and how do you want me to perform it and i just believe it's by the spirit of the living god leading us amen there's there's people in life they don't want leadership only by what they can taste or touch or feel amen i'm glad i don't i'm not led by my feelings by my own thoughts amen read also in romans chapter 8 in verse 18 you know there's a great conflict that we war against and that's you know we have a humanity that it's still it's a nature and it's influenced right our lives we have a human life we have a nature and yet there's another nature inside amen and now those two are struggling who's gonna who's gonna be on display amen the world they only have one option they're just declaring the world but amen we're under a different influence there's a different intoxication for the believer amen there is a wine for the believer today the stimulation of revelation in romans chapter 8 verse 18 says this he says for i reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you know it's it's it's a it's amazing to me the word of god when there's a comparison there you know a lot of times we don't move unless there's a reward or some kind of motivation something to achieve and you know that's kind of what man has done they've gone out with science civilization and education and it's what man can achieve but i see another light in the scripture that says that the suffering of this present world is not worthy to be compared now this is the comparison that i want to to esteem this is the comparison that i want to lead me it's that there will be a glory which shall be revealed in us amen and what is that what is that glory what is that place that a believer can come to where it is the glory of god it's not my will but it's god's will amen i just think it's it's it's just not the way of man when you pray for revelation you're praying for suffering i just it's so contrary you know like who would want trials who wants suffering who wants tribulations who wants like rejection who wants reproaches but within the word of god paul's saying here that it's not even worthy to be compared for the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestations of the sons of god for the creation was made subject to vanity not willing but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travail it in pain together until now and that that word vanity i was looking it up because it's it's interesting that there's a groaning that's happening and the whole creation is is there's an expectation but yet there's this vanity and and i the definition of vanity is an inflated pride in oneself it's it's or the appearance you know it's an emptiness it's a it's valueless and you know i just think about the sin nature of man i think about you know we didn't come here to this world choosing to be born right right we were subject to sin nature amen and now but the whole creation because that wasn't god's plans for his children that wasn't the first estate right so but we're now all subject to this vanity and and we've come into an atmosphere where it's completely polluted amen and even like a time where sickness and politics have gone absolutely to to to this degree and it's it's created a toxic atmosphere where you can hardly know who's saying the truth or who's just uh speaking lies like you know and so it creates an atmosphere where it it it tries to [Music] like stall the growth of the believer or or you lose your focus because what happens is the world can influence the believer to start acting out just like the world right i mean we're all subject to vanity but praise god he didn't leave us without a help amen i'm so thankful for that said i wouldn't leave you comfortless right so there's a these bird pains and it's it's interesting to me like even the scripture says in philippians i don't know if i read that but praise the lord you're feeling good i tell you god is so merciful i i was feeling really nervous and i got to thinking you know it it's the love of god that constrains us to move amen and and you know that you know the love of god it's in the believers and well i just i feel like it was just the the prayers of the saints you just start settling in and the wife every one time you came up here and you started testifying or something you know what i'm talking about praise the lord in philippians maybe they can put it up in the back i'm looking for chapter 1 and verse 21. anybody can testify that god is real amen god's been there for you day by day moment by moment the scripture says there in uh philippians 1 and 21 he says for me to live is christ and to die is gain you know i think about that and you know it's it's it's all glorious whether you live or die it's all glorious in the sight of god when you're when you're born again and you're a new creature in christ jesus there's really like the scripture says he works all things together for good and so my what it what an exchange you know you think about what the rags that we had and now god he gives us life and and now it's uh the results are so glorious and the manifestation of god is always in the flesh amen for the believer we get to be a partaker of that brother branham made this statement in a message called birth pains he says now i want to speak this afternoon on and announce birth pains now i know it sounds bad but it's the bible i believe that jesus here speaking of he said you will have sorrow but your sorrow will turn into joy speaking to his disciples knowing that the birth of christianity was coming into existence amen and now the old has to die in order for the new to be born you know that's that's just the way it is we go through seasons we go through different things and god's wanting to give us that elevated experience he wants to move us up into perfection he wants us to to lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us and and even like our our brother peter said he said think it not strange when you come into these diverse temptations you know those those temptations those trials are actually squeezing you into a place many times where the only thing that can bring you out of that is the very seed word of god coming to manifestation amen don't you thank god sometimes well the trials the suffering it how can you count it all joy because the word of god said he'd work it for good amen says now the old has to die in order that the new is born to have anything that gives birth it has to the pains of distress and there certainly was going to go through pain and distress and anguish to get from law to grace amen naturally nature birth types the spiritual birth all things of the natural is types of the spiritual and we find out if we look the ground and we see a tree in the earth growing it is struggling for life that's going to show that there's a tree somewhere and it that it doesn't die amen don't you aren't you so glad that there's a place there's a there's you know there's a a life that you never die amen if we didn't have the hope we would be the most miserable people i mean it wouldn't even when you when you face the hard times when you face the persecutions and distress if we didn't have that hope my what would i mean it might as well just be like the world he said there's got to be a tree somewhere that doesn't die because it's crying out for something we find no matter how old how sick what condition they're crying out to live because it shows there's a life somewhere that we live live forever notice how perfect you know i just think about sometimes in life you know you you you really don't know where to turn when you're struggling but i just i think about how you know the examples you know of people who took god at his word and the the promise was manifest it seemed like it came to the very last hour the darkest hour you know even like paul and i think about i was listening to brother branham's life story this week and it just the the testimony it just become more valuable what god took our prophet messenger through and you know i mean he was broken he the the very love and life of christ actually it just is so profound in a believer i just you know to think about you know coming to a place and being an example of what obedience and and what disobedience you know we we're we're subject to the word of god and we're subject to mistakes my and to think that there's there's um witnesses that have gone before us and that we can we don't have to suffer the same heartache we can look to the example you know i appreciate our pastor one it's been a while you know and and uh and it just always stuck with me is you know he said you know um experience is a good teacher you know he said but that's not the best teacher and i'm like now you got my attention he said uh instruction you know heating instruction and and i got to thinking about you know if i had a job and they said hey you need a hard hat you need boots you need this that and the other you know if if i just said i was going to do my own thing i mean you get some lumps on your head doing it that way you know and that's how we are in our nature we're subject to this vanity like our own thinking what we can do and how we got it all thought out and planned out and oh my thank thank god for a provided word amen at the end time we don't have to just kind of wonder and try to figure things out because you can't figure out god god has to reveal it amen that's why we're depending upon the revelation and this groaning is not in vain amen the trials the distress the struggle it's actually to bring a warning of what is needed amen you know the the the relational struggles the job search you know the the the different you know needs that we have from sickness or or even when you look at how the world's just completely falling apart there's a word that's been provided amen and i thank god that there's a people it's not a it's not a message just for the minister just for the evangelist just for the deacons or the trustees but amen it's it's a people that are part of a body amen we have to find our place our position because god wants to materialize the very life of christ in you in your situations amen i just think about the truth you know something that that just it just strikes me when you when you consider you know our lives as individuals and how we're connected to each other and how that we have an influence you know brother branham made a statement i'll read it in a little bit but he said you know there was there was a uh uh you know the the church was losing the power and testimony or the power and influence of their testimony and i thought my i don't never want that to be my testimony that i've that i haven't identified with what god's provided can you imagine god providing all of this and this is carnal but like we're here at a bank with all this money you know and we just never went to it because oh you know i just i'm i'm okay i don't need that but it's like the promises of god can you imagine losing like someone taking god at his word and and just oh you know seeing the materialization because the testimonies and the power and influence it's not just to one another you know there's people out there that you know i hear it constantly you know they they they're looking for a hope you know and in simplicity this gospel [Music] oh my you know to think that there's a judgment coming you know but it's the gospel is so simple amen thank god for the simplicity of the gospel you know they want god the the man said to me he said you know i was i was believing on god for the the uh the uh fire policy i said fire policy yeah you know you know like some people just accept god to dodge hell you know and i thought my goodness what a shallow version of what's been provided my goodness i mean to be in fellowship where god he leads you to fulfillment to give you all of what's groaning what's longing in your heart my and then when they see your light you know you are the light of the world when they see your life yielded to the manifestation of the word of god they said now i i have some hope i could i can just inquire of them my you know i think about the the war disguised in prosperities when he was ministering i started thinking about samuel i'm sorry samson and in judges chapter 16 in verse 16 the you know the story and how that you know samson he was raised up to destroy his enemy and you know he ended up giving his strength to god and he gave his heart to delilah and and you know it just brother branham made this statement and he preached this message multiple times and it just it just it's so fitting for our day the parallels and brother branham said this and um once more in in 63 in november 17th he says look at him humiliated broken a symbol of a fallen church spiritually stripped morally broken what an example of the conditions today samson this was samson the great so this was him a great mighty instrument of god why many philistines i would imagine the lord the war lord standing there looking there why the very remembrance of that of his name the whole country trembled just say samson then you all had to do just mention the name samson and everybody trembled at his name and now look why he said you know it used to be that the name of the lord jesus was a great reverence people honored highly honored it and the ones who honored it cast out evil spirits by it and could make nature obey their command at his name my but i think that samson here what i want to to parallel is is the modern condition of the church today it's a perfect parallel the church has lost has long lost its respect but not because god has filled the church but because the church failed god amen and it's the the and we ought to be standing in the same condition like the church was when ananias and sapphiras brought before the church but instead we have long compromised with the things of the world and brought it in and and it hasn't does impact the dignity that it should have and i guess as they stood there standing to their feet when the main event was taking place and just took themselves back for a few minutes i can imagine the philistines the warriors standing there with their fine jeweled women their arm arms around them drinking and toasting dagon my what a picture hail dagon of victorious over jehovah and we have showed them what we can do we showed this fella who claims so much and there is nothing to him can you imagine what what a like yielding your strength but not your heart how it god didn't fail samson amen god doesn't fail us you know a lot of times we go in doing our own thing amen we're all guilty but there's a grace amen there's a word for us there's a warning you know a word of warning and i think brother branham gave this this this example about the muhammadin and there was a foremost evangelist and he brought he said let's bring 30 people and and you pray for 15 and and he just wasn't up for the challenge but you know there's a people that have come in contact with god that know the power of the name of jesus christ because they've been blood washed they've been made new creatures in christ jesus amen can i get a witness is there somebody in here that knows the power of the resurrection by the shedding of the blood of the lamb amen amen these signs shall follow them that believe it is almost come [Music] another celebration when the heathen god can speak to the church and they stand there helpless defeated spiritually stripped now there is something that's done that now this is god this is this is largely what's got my attention because you know when we come to the house of god it's it's where's my weak place you know because the chain is only as strong as its weakest link amen and we all bind our hearts together this is not a one-man thing this is god leading us as a body amen we must grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord jesus christ we all need one another there's no big one no little one amen it takes the prayers of the believers to make things happen amen he said he says this he says it's been the cares of the world entered into the church and it's got it no more than a lodge my i know that he's talking about the worldly church but amen god's dealing with us as individuals and i can testify god help me there is something that is is warning me you know you can get to where even the parables spoke about you know the seed that was sown and and you know different things the the ground and you know you think about how even the cares of the world can choke out the life of christ you know we can get so busy my if we could only remember the influence and power of our testimony what it was like to go before god in that desperate hour and that desperate kind i can't live another day unless you save me from myself you save me from this sin nature you give me a hope of a future that is not like the one the the the the reality that i have today i just feel to have a revival in my own heart you know brother branham said overcoming is to keep revised to keep in revival amen i don't want to grow cold i don't want to get so caught up into my daily routine the cares and pressures of this world the burdens of life packing a burden whether it's sickness or financial debt or the burdens that we have in prayer you know these are not weights that are supposed to destroy us these are things that are supposed to drive us into the groaning for manifestation amen god has made a way for us to overcome the church has lost the influence of its testimony that it's a living moving body of christ amen but they've lost the courage that's what samson had done lost its power amen thank god that he's promised a restoration amen these are things that in our individual life we don't want to lose the power and influence of our testimony you know we got the world that tries to influence us to do and to express that manifestation but praise god there's a spirit that when he has the preeminence that which is groaning that's what we're that deep that's calling for expression we love to see that expression amen you know as i was thinking about that scripture um ii peter you know you think about uh the atmosphere i know brother jeremy is speaking about you know atmosphere and you know the world has an atmosphere that they want to draw you into their atmosphere you know different spirits they want fellowship and so they're trying to pull you into you know hey you know have a business or get an education so you can have easy street and and different things but as a christian there's going to be a struggle amen and but the world they trying to pull you into their way and they're in a manifestation but i just think you know like the scripture says in [Music] ii peter chapter 3 and verse 1. says this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by holy prophets and the commandments of us apostles of the lord and savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust you know that's that's golfers they have an influence you know scoffers this oh you holy roller or man you are going off the deep end you go to church three times a week man you overachiever you know they have all this scoffing trying to influence you to oh try to cool you off you know because they want fellowship he says and they're saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the worlds that were was were being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word is kept store reserved unto a fiery fire against the day of judgment and perdition to the ungodly men but beloved and i'll just stop there for a minute because you know it's it's god's desire that no one would perish that all would come to the knowledge of the truth but praise god god doesn't he doesn't say by his desire he's saved by for knowledge amen he can predestinate amen thank god we're in that class tonight amen but you think about this attitude you know the scoffing and they say well where is the sign of his coming you know the promise of his coming things are just continuing as they are and you know people they they reject the word of god and yet they carry on they prosper in the way i mean they can print money and they say well you know we can keep this thing going and you know i just think about this it's a it's a condition i looked up this it's called a normalcy bias you know and this is a cognitive bias where man that leads people to disbelieve or minimize threats of warning you know it gets them to deny and to underestimate the possibility of disaster you know i think about you know as the the the the narrative oh you know this thing you know it'll go on and on and you know god is not mocked you know mankind is continually sowing away from the word of god and it always brings destruction when you consider when god sends a prophet that's god's mercy to the nations it's god's mercy to the world and now i mean that same spirit that was in him is in you now god sending you you're the mercy to the world it's the same spirit of christ in you now it's leading us in the midst of a crook and corrupt generation this normalcy bias one of the dangers of the effect is they disbelieve or minimize the threats and it leads to an unfair persecution of a group like the holocaust and other slaveries so you see the the condition of the world the atmosphere is ripe to bring a persecution and so those of us who have received the word for this hour you know we embrace our burden our cross amen because you know it's not very long before the fire is going to fall amen i don't want to be caught up with just the cares of this world because there is a a reward to those who diligently seek him amen there's a reward to those who who will lay their life down in christ and and god seek out that which was lost amen praise god we've become ambassadors for the king amen what a privilege that we have i mean so many people throughout all the the dispensations of the new testament that they wanted to live in this day i don't want to lose the influence and the power of our testimony the called out in the last day to receive the very life of christ to be restored full restoration to come into the fullness of christ why what a privilege brother branham makes a statement in in the messiah now we know that we have five gates on the outside see taste touch smell in here and and the five gates on the inside and brother branham goes into that about a man made in a system of a tabernacle the outer courts then the holies place and the holies of holies and the shekinah glory on the inside the veil now the outside gates of a man has a five senses that enter into the body and then inside in the soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's inside of the heart that produces the soul and makes the atmosphere in him now then inside that there's one gate and that one entrance is into the shekinah glory where god can enter in and take over the control tower and the only way that's through self-will we know this amen it's it's so good that we can come to a place that god's just like in the garden he placed man on freemore agency to choose or reject my i just i just think about what it my what a privilege it is to be those that that are able to humble themselves to the will of the father the word of god amen amen but we must either choose right or wrong either one you want to now self-will then god comes into the man into the heart which is in the spirit and the spirit makes the soul now when a man is converted say just like a button in the heart that part is god when you're born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwelling in you and he can let the spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press god's way through it again and then come back into the same condition that was in the garden of eden verily verily i say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and do not doubt in your heart but believe what you say it will come to pass and he puts that right back supreme again puts it right back in that condition amen and i think i thank god for you know god is in our midst restoring this we can even see it in the testimony of our brother standing here proclaiming the same god is going to move on the scene and it's already working amen i love it because even like our pastor says god can do nothing for you except you first proclaim it testify of it amen we don't want to just be sitting in in our service and and you know coming and getting the orders and not carrying them out amen there's people that you know i don't want to be encumbered with a a results ministry i'm not looking for results i want to be an obedient son amen i just want to go into hold the world and testify what god's done amen leave the results up to god amen i just think about how profound it was that god he allowed man to to have an article in the reader's digest he was talking about how they had they had a man that he didn't know it but he was praying for somebody and they they took the picture the x-ray of the light radiating a cosmic light radiating from the man as he was praying for the sick you know and and brother branham says now it's like they they putting the x-ray down and they found out the light coming from his hand and god knew what he was talking about when he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he know what he was speaking of and i want to see the church press into that place where they can come like god wants them to be amen isn't that your heart's desire do you have confidence that god will fulfill his word if you feel burdened for somebody and you know that if you lay hands on the sick if you speak to this mountain god will move that mountain amen then god was made flesh and dwelt and and became the messiah then if we can yield ourselves and be anointed like he was we become messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that's god's church standing lights in the light of the messiah risen christ in his people anointed ones carrying forth the light into all the church ages amen praise the lord that we got this you know you know i i tell you it just means so much more to me than ever the the the life that god brought william branham through you know because you see that he was like a first fruit of a restored son that that we can look to and and see now god's going to have a harvest time where he harvests he'll thrust the sickle for the last time before the fiery judgments falls and so i i was listening to the testimony just started pulsating something deep i can't explain it but there's something that resonates there's something that that that is groaning to to come to this place where god is dealing with us as individuals the same way he did not necessarily in the visions and because he fulfilled his part but i just think about something that he had said when uh it was a message is this the signs of the answer he said now the vision had my wife and my you know part of there was a groaning in his life he saw a vision and now there was something that was driving him to fulfillment you know i thank god that he just doesn't let us you know kind of uh just do in ourselves you know he's that great eagle that flaps his wings and takes the feathers out of the nest and then it starts getting to where we have to move it's like the issue's forced we can't stay in the same place we've got to move forward and so brother branham is talking about that vision he had in him and his wife and his children in that and it was the thing it was it was the covered wagon and the minute i was walking in there there was i was in that in my station wagon and that way we leave a couple of days not knowing where we were going not knowing where we're going to be to do when we get there just going god is strange to us because his ways are past finding out he wants obedience where are you going well that's none of your business just keep going where you want me to do lord that's nothing for you follow thou me just keep walking where will i stop what's that to you just keep walking so here i go in the name of jesus christ amen yeah i just feel like that's that's i just tell on myself sometimes you want to know where am i going you know what are you going to do with me when i get there you know i just said god help to get the fear out i don't i don't have to figure this thing out i don't have to know everything but you know what we have a promise that he would reveal it as we have need of it aren't you grateful that you're in that kind of relationship praise the lord i won't keep you very much longer just feel so good to be in his presence you know i just think about you know the lord he was born you know of a virgin and yet he he subjected himself to all manner of temptation all manner of sickness all manner of heartache he was burdened and he groaned in the spirit he came to a place where his wa his blood separated the water from the blood i mean what he did for us he was squeezed out and crushed amen for you and i and think about the the message brother branham talked about this in perfect faith he said now he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what he was sent for and you think sometimes why would a man with so full of power like him would ever be sick yes sir i've read some book somewhere where he was raised up that boy the widow's son from naaman i believe it was the prince of the house of david and he sat on a rock and groaned with a headache see he bore our infirmities bear means to pack them see he bore he had all things like we have he had sickness he had temptations he had troubles he had frustrations just like we had because he had to be the right kind of mediator so that he can be a partaker a husband of the fruit before he would know my think about that you know god knows what you're going through god knows the suffering and the the frustrations he's he he subjected himself to those things so that you don't have to bear them alone amen praise the lord you know i got to thinking about you know in that testimony brother branham in perfect faith you know that's that's what we're coming to this perfect word brings a perfect faith and you know he was talking about jesus not using his power for himself but he came to give it and and i believe that god works on both ends of the line amen you know there's people that are on your heart burdens people who are without the lord some people they may be struggling in school they may maybe wondering what the meaning of life is some people may just you know be looking to just to have a friend you know and yet this one that bore the infirmity now wants to bear the infirmities of others through a body and you know a lot of times we're looking for a reward now but our reward comes later amen and you just think about you know god working on both ends of the line someone that you know somebody that you've been praying for they're crying out to god and god's using you to make a connection and i think about brother dao and how that it just it just struck me and i'll read it you know when um he said god told me the other day with brother dao here that i would shake his hand on the street again that very strange it wasn't he wasn't here this morning but two minutes longer and i would not have met him on the street but he stepped out of the car and i stepped out of the car in the time to shake his hand when he was coming on the street he didn't know me he didn't he had his glasses off and he couldn't see me but when he heard my voice he started crying what was it usually he doesn't do that but it was an answer to what was told him under the oxygen tent he would do it i said you also said in the church again it's your heart's desire and when we are having chicago meetings he wanted to come to the meeting his heart was for it i sent him a telegram greeting for us and the children and told him we were praying that he would get well quick a lovely brother who visited him and he wanted to come back so bad and here he sits tonight with us see that wasn't prearranged the same god arranged it and makes it work perfectly on the dot amen there are certain things in your life that i just believe it's the same god that's working on the other end of the line for those that their burden they they have a desire and yet your your gift of faith can actually speak forth and even just be moved to send a telegram i'm praying for you and just watch god manifest the things that we're groaning for amen praise the lord we can invite the musicians to come trust that um the lord's good to you he's definitely good to me you know i was testifying to somebody the other day about how god he supernaturally healed my back and you know i told god i would never shy away from the testimony but you know what happens when you testify there's a test it wasn't i didn't even think two three hours and i was getting a catch in my back and all of a sudden i started feeling an attack but you know what i remember that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it wasn't very long that i was liberated again you know i thank god that god's power is greater than anything amen why don't we stand praise the lord it's our opportunity to feed the seed and let the holy spirit quicken what's we're groaning for we're groaning for a manifestation we can't do it on our own but like the scripture says i believe it's in philippians that it's actually god in you to will and to do of his good pleasure our part is to go forward without murmuring or disputing amen god just have your way whatever you want to do you don't have to show me where i'm going you don't have to tell me what i'm going to do when i get there but if you'll just leave me i'll go i want to be an obedient son how many here tonight have that same desire just want to be obedient you want to lift your hands while we pray heavenly father lord god in simplicity lord we just want to see you move in our lives lord i want to see you move in this church lord to see the same god the same power the same testimonies lord jesus we ask god that tonight lord the things that we're groaning for lord that you had manifested not on the basis of what we are so much lord is just what you promised lord that you would manifest your goodness in this end-time
