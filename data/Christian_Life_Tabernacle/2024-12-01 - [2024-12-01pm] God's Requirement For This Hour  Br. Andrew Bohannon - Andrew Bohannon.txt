Description:
God's Requirement For This Hour
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Sunday Evening Service
December 1st, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you you trust the Lord will be your portion tonight you brother well I feel like in many ways this is my first time amen you know sometimes you just uh the Lord takes you in different places and uh you know but I'm happy to be here and I trust the Lord will be your portion tonight you know all we want to be is what God made us we just want to be faithful to what he placed on our heart just get out of the way that the Lord can do something for his people amen that's why we gathered here tonight to see the power of transformation change lives change Hearts do what he said he would do to prepare our hearts to meet him that's the whole goal when we come here we come to hear from Heaven you know if there's anything in life to be attained to is to hear the voice of God personally because this is the hour where there's so many voices there's so so many things that try to Allure our attention say well this is it I got it but oh my the word of God is the anchor amen amen let's bow our heads together our precious Lord Jesus Lord to be able to speak that holy name in prayer father Lord It's what a privilege we have Lord tonight not only to speak it but to know that you can answer her back father Lord you're not some God that is so far away that you can't oh God come tonight and meet our every need father Lord as we look once again into your word father we pray that you would open it up to us Lord a mortal man can turn the pages and he can speak the experiences that you've took him through but father it takes the operation of your Holy Spirit to bring Revelation and that's we call upon that tonight father we pray you bless your people Lord with the food that you stored up Lord and may we be built up father that we can do that which is pleasing in your sight father help us tonight Lord to just give ourselves over to your faithful hands father we commit the communion and footwash service Lord asking that you be glorified in it and that your people will be strengthened for the glory of God God amen amen praise the lord well been a little bit nervous but praise God we're here maybe if you have your Bibles I'm thinking to share a little thought that came on my heart and we'll just go into Proverbs 23 and this um scripture kind of came into my heart and you know it's sometimes just through a little scripture that the Lord directs you amen that's what that's what directs the believer is the voice of the word amen we'll also be turning to Exodus chapter 12 but there in Proverbs 23 and 11 and 12 for their redeemer is mighty he shall plead their cause with thee applying thine heart unto instruction in thine ears to the words of knowledge amen and also there in Exodus 12 you know I've been reading in Exodus and thinking about we're in a Third Exodus and there was going to be all these plagues that were going to be poured out and the final plague was death and so just kind of as I was going back through I the Lord began to awaken the reality of of what's transpiring in our day there's about to be a bunch of vials and the woses and different things upon the world but praise God God sent a message amen and Vindicated with the prophet that gives us the clear instruction that we can apply our heart to that wisdom amen so there in chapter 12 and verse 12 says for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will Smite all the firstborn of the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt will I execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be unto you for a token upon the houses wherewith ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plug the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt amen you may have your seeds and we trust the Lord will bless the reading of his word to your heart you know I just you know a lot of times as believers we hear certain phrases in the message and sometimes we just need to dig down a little bit and get some more instruction you know there's times where you know you'd be fellowshipping with a brother or in a situation and you know you say you just must be identified with your sacrifice you know and we look at ourselves and we think well this is my identity and then you also a lot of times we say well that's not your true identity when you see behaviors and things that you're doing in different actions you say well this is not who I am this is just what I'm doing and who you are is a son and daughter of God Amen and a lot of times we forget our identity but that's what this message has come to do is reveal our true identity and I just wanted to read a um out of the token message this this message here in um this one is the one he said a token and this is in um I believe it's 0901 uh 63 I believe but we're going to pick up here in um I want to say paragraph 66 and it says this and that's the way of a real Christian you know it just reminds me of when brother when Brother David preached out of the way of a true Prophet but he said the way of a a true Christian and this this is just another just coming behind that just to you know point to the to the mark of the High Calling a lot of times as a minister we we go through personal things and and the Lord shows us something it's not that we've attained but that we're pressing towards amen but the Lord put this on my heart so I just wanted to share this little bit with you but he says a the way of a real Christian is self-sacrifice themselves not caring for this world but giving all they got to God what a a vision what a Target what an aim amen he says now this was the perfect lamb Christ was and then through the shed of the shedding of the Lamb the natural lamb in Egypt was the blood was applied and then it was it stood for a token then the blood of this lamb stood for the token that we are dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice then the lamb and the blood and the person becomes identified together the sacrifice and the believer amen oh I love that that just makes it so plain a lot of times we don't realize that our identity is truly with the sacrifice that makes you what you are when your life is identified by your sacrifice amen the blood was a token or an identification the blood identified the worshipper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself and he was not ashamed he did not care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it it was in a POS uh in such a position that everybody passing could see the token my see many people want want to be Christians and they they like to do it in secret so nobody would know that they were Christians the associates around them with some of them what some of them would think well now look I want to be a Christian but I don't want soand so to know about it well now you see that's not Christianity Christianity has to display its token see it's a public a public life at the office on the street when trouble is around anything in the church wherever wherever else the blood is the token and the token must be applied if it isn't or it's not even the the Covenant is not in effect my the blood has a token or an identification identifying this person has been redeemed my think about it they were there in the Old Testament and they came to a place where the prophet of God now said okay now we're coming to a time where you're going to have to get this lamb and you're going to have to slay it it wasn't just an ordinary lamb but that there was a certain Criterium and they couldn't just not put their hands on their sacrifice you you know it's it's one of those things that it was going to be a little bit of a mess there was going to be some blood on your hands and then you had to take that blood and you had to apply it to the door it's like a paint there was going to be something that every single person passing by that would know that there was something that died that somebody said this this thing that I'm doing is because I'm guilty I know I've crossed God's law I know that I'm not right but I'm not a shame because I've come God's provided way I know that there was a sacrifice that God's provided and I'm not a be ashamed to be identified with it it's on full display my and this is just the natural type but if that blood was not applied it they could be standing there and they can be around it they can be believing they were true Jews they could be Israelites they could be believing in Jehovah keeping the law they could have been circumcised on the eighth day they could have been at holding to the word of God to a complete full manifestation of everything that was said they were keeping it but when Moses came and he said now there's going to be a lamb that was slave now you're going to have to take hosf and you're going to have to take the blood and put it on the lentil and the post it could not just be uh uh reasoned away say wait wait I'm a Believer I believe the word of God but from that time if they couldn't do or didn't humble themselves to be identified with this this sacrifice this way of worship no you know I I believe in Jesus but you you're talking about a prophet that's coming this day well we don't need prophets no more we don't believe in speaking in Tong we don't believe in the Holy Ghost my just think about our day amen there's all kinds of voices there's different people have ideas but praise God we're going to let go of our own ideas we're going to look to the word of God and we're going to see the example given to us amen this is representative of the person who has been redeemed now well notice they had they were redeemed before anything ever happened by faith they applied the blood see before it actually happened the blood was supplied by faith believing that it was going to happen before the wrath of God passed through the land the blood had to be applied first it was too late after the Wrath had done Fallen my now there's a lesson that we could really maybe uh uh take a thought but just for a moment but look before it happens there is coming a time that when you will not be able to to apply that blood amen my I'm just I'm just speaking from my heart this this uh the Lord directed me to this because I began to realize just like as brother Billy was ministering like you know we get to a a time where we build things like we schedule things we have work we have family life we have work life we have church life we have all these things that we're doing and and I just said wait a minute this Christianity that God sent in this last day is supposed to be manifested as a life and it and it can't be hidden th this light can't be put over a bushel it's supposed to shine out amen we can't not let this word that God is speaking to our hearts just not be applied in our everyday living you know I I just I'll stop here for a minute and just forgive me for a minute I'm ah this is I'm a two- water guy one on the right one on the left but praise the Lord you know I thank God that we serve a living God I thank God that when God gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you something that changes situations amen and and I just tell you I'm so thankful what God did for our sister Genie I am so grateful just in a short period of time I mean the enemy he showed his bluff he put his head up but you know what he put it around Sons and Daughters of God and he stuck his neck out a little bit too far and God showed up on the scene because he's here to prove himself once again to his children you know you you you make your stand for me and I'll stand for you you know and that's what this was it it was before they did it by faith they applied the blood before any destruction fell and that's where we're at before the bombs fall before all this chaos ues we must apply the token what does that mean apply the token what does it mean identified with your sacrifice amen but as we're reading here it says it it identified that this person is redeemed amen and as we take communion tonight and we have communion and foot washing I just was God was dealing with me about what it really means to apply the token what brother brandham was saying and so as I got into it I said my Lord just speak to me amen and so as we go through this maybe open some more of it up to us amen he says this in 73 he says now the lamb was killed in the evening time after being kept up for 14 days and then the lamb has killed and the blood was applied in the evening time you get it the token C never came into existence until the evening time my and if we can go over to uh 137 it says this he says but when I see the token I'll pass over you it's God's requirement of this hour the evening time message is to apply the token amen and that's if I had a title I would probably say that God's requirement of this hour you know and for a subject just to apply the token we want to apply the token amen but I got to thinking and you know how how do we apply this token you know and I thought in John chapter 15 this is um if you'll turn with me there John chapter 15 you know if if we can see a promise in God then then we can walk into it amen it says this in John 15 and verse 20 John 15 verse 20 he says remember the word that I said unto you has has the Lord ever said anything unto you h as Believers we should be remembering what the Lord has said unto us I I don't I think that there's things that we remember other people said to us and it hurt our feelings it made us feel insecure it kind of questioned our identity do I have the Holy Ghost do I have this do I really have what God has has said that I have but he says now remember the word that I said unto you amen or I could just stop down there but it just remember the words that the Lord spoke to you because you can always go back to it it can be strength it can be food it can be help the servant is not greater than his Lord if they have persecuted me they will pers also persecute you if they have kept my Saints they will keep yours also we'll drop down there to 26 but he says but when the comforter is come when I will send unto you whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning and I just thought how special that was if you can accept it tonight I I have accepted it in my heart and this token life God also wants to Bear witness in your life so he promised that he was going to send the comforter amen and he was going to it was going to be the spirit of Truth The Very life of Jesus Christ and you now are going to also bear witness you are the representation that God is going to Bear witness of the spirit of Truth my you know when brother brandham opened up in this this um token message it's just so profound sometimes our minds just raised but we want a simple projection and a simple goal but in 42 he says now we don't just stand here to be seen nor come together to see the clothes we're wearing we come here for one thing he says to hear the word that's right the word coming to us see we want that cuz that's the only thing that's going to mean anything anything that's going to be substantial anything that's going to help us amen he says and then we're we're a dying people all human beings are headed towards eternity and then we've got this much time to make our decision which way we're headed to and the road is before us we can take either side the way that we choose amen now he says this in 44 he says but we remember that no matter matter what we do how successful we are in life without Christ we're totally lost so if he is if he is all that there is to look forward to then we would be most foolish people not to accept it to cherish it not only accept it but to do something greater than that that after you got it you don't take it and lay it on the Shelf you put it to use amen that's right that's my heart's desire is that this what God has done when he speaks to us we don't just lay it on the Shelf but God when he speaks to us he wants us to put it into action put it into use let that Faith go into action and he talks about that you know it's like a doctor giving you medicine my can you imagine imagine if you're sick and this medicine's proven to to to to take care of it and we just leave it on the Shelf my that's what that's what like when God gives us the Holy Ghost and he gives us his word and then we just carry on with the regular routine at work but that's to help give us the right Vision amen the right projection the right foundation now now the first thing token it a token is a sign a sign of a fair price paid a fair or a price a required price has been paid I remember when I was a Youngster we went to the video arcade games and you wouldd have to put the dollars in there because it didn't just take hoars you had to have what they call tokens and but it only only worked at that arcade so you had to kind of ponder hey I'm only going to spend this much I can't put a $5 bill in there because I'm not going to be here that long right you know and how many tokens of different things do we have we're not going to be here that long this token is the only thing that matters this is this is the life that we want to display oh my it's a sign of a price paid he says therefore if it has been if it would be a a wolf I'm sorry I jumped amen my goodness see now down there he was speaking and we are starting in God was saying to Israel the blood of the Lamb is a token to you Israel's slain lamb was Jehovah's required token it must be the blood God made a token and gave it to Israel and no other token will work it cannot be recognized that was the only way the only thing that God requires is the token he says when I see the blood I'll pass over you amen my just thinking the requirement that Jehovah had met see the blood was representative that this was God's requirement and it had been met the wrath of God had been satisfied but that was only substitutionary that was only temporary but it was speaking of something see the the an animal the Beast life it was a lower life form that couldn't come back upon the worshipper so he still had the same conscience he was still doing the same old things but he knew that that was God's provided way that when the death angel was going to pass that it wouldn't plague those in the house amen the blood was the token that the requ of Jehovah was met that it had been done the blood stood for the token and God said the day you eat thereof is the day you die and there was had been a substitutionary life for the believer God in Mercy accepted the substitute of the life of a defiled person when his CH child was defied defiled himself in sin and disbelieve the word then God rich in Mercy made a substitute and that was something had to die in its place my praise the Lord that God's provided a uh sacrifice amen now this says the believing worship worshipper was identified in his sacrifice by the token I don't I don't wish to say this for very long but he says the believer had to be identified with the sacrifice if it was a just a sacrifice made Somewhere Out There He gave it and he had to be identified frankly had to put his hands on it and be identified with the sacrifice then the blood was placed to where he could stand underneath it the blood was over him and that was a token that he had identified himself guilty and then prove an innocent that an innocent substitute took his place my I I tell you if the prophet didn't say it like that I would have never been able to look at what the token looked like sometimes we we I just I'm GNA say me sometimes I you get to a place where you forget how guilty you were before the blood actually was applied to your heart you know I I don't I don't remember because it's been it's like but God helped me to understand and remember how he dealt with my guilt like what did I used to do with my guilt I used to hide it I would I would hide it trying to hide it in success trying to hide it in uh the ability to know great wisdom or or or be funny or go out drinking or relationships or anything but praise God God has a token a blood that was shed that it can deal with our guilt and I'm not a I'm not ashamed to be identified with the cross amen that that represents that blood that was shed represents the forgiveness and I've been redeemed I was guilty of sin that's good praise God I'm identified with My Sacrifice I've identified myself guilty and he had proven it was a proven innocent substitute had taken my place oh maybe that's why I forgot about the guilt cuz I have a perfect lamb amen but it's a good reminder because you know if God took my guilt and he laid it on the cross he can do it for you he can do it for anybody amen if they'll be identified with this lamb amen and they'll Place their hands upon that Lamb's head amen what a beautiful picture oh a redeemed see Justice had been met the requirement of God's holy Justice had been met now I'll require your life and then when the the life had sinned then an innocent substitute took its place and it was blood Beast not an apple that ought to make the serpent seed so plain to everybody that it was the blood and that blood which could not come from fruit it come from an innocent substitute the life had gone out amen my to be connected with our sacrifice you know when we think about our Lord and how God when he saw the the Savior the Redeemer you know the lamb sacrifice there's nothing so innocent as a lamb and when we look at the the lamb nature it it was to be led amen and then when God he he placed such a uh like a just a beautiful picture when the Dove came down on the lamb at his baptism you know and brother Brandon goes through and he starts saying about our nature you know there's a nature on the inside that we need to be reunited with you know our first birth it's like a goat nature it pushes back ah I want my own way I want to do my own thing but there's something on the inside that's a compatibility with that Dove amen am but we had to fight we have to bring this thing under the token we have to say God he took my guilt I don't have to continue in this I can claim the blood what a wonderful picture amen says what a perfect type of Christ just exactly the believer today standing under the shed blood identified with the sacrifice just as perfect as he can be oh my I like that so much and it's not our Perfection it's his amen praise the Lord you know it's just so wonderful he says this he says and then the dove led the lamb and notice the lamb to the slaughter now the lamb was obedient to the dove so no matter where it led it it was willing to go and I wonder today when God leads us to a complete a life complete surrendered and service to him I wonder if our Spirits then sometimes don't Rebel kind of showing that wonder if we are lamb see a lamb is obedient a lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't take and claim its own can lay it right down and Shear its wool off that's the only thing it's got it never says anything about it it just sacrifices everything that's God that's a lamb it gives everything it gives everything away itself and all it is amen I thank God that God said that he was going to witness amen that was going to be we were going to Bear witness of this very thing what he is you are amen amen so if he has this lamb nature that's already been displayed you also are going to Bear witness of it because God's power of transformation because what he said he's going to do and you can hold that in your heart you can keep it on your mind you can apply your heart to this wisdom I say help me Lord I realize in me I just I'm not doing all of this but praise God the message came so that we can apply the token now this was a perfect lamb amen Christ the token that we are dead to ourselves and identified with our sacrifice then the lamb L and the blood of that person comes identifying together the sacrifice and the believer see you are identified your life by your sacrifice and that makes who you are amen praise the lord well I wasn't going to come up here with any notes and I was going to use this thing that I had used this thing in four years so this is not working for me but praise the Lord you know and maybe if we could just look right here on 77 he says uh 76 let's just back up a little bit but but it could not come upon a human being because animal life does not have a soul and the animal doesn't know that he is naked he just he doesn't real realize sin he know none so therefore it's a living being but not a living Soul therefore that animal could not come upon a human being because it don't have a soul in the life now there is a life a blood a life a soul in the life the soul is the nature of the life therefore it is no certain nature it's an animal therefore the blood stood for a token that the life had been given but in this glorious place under this Covenant there's no difference between the blood and the life the token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost not a blood a chemistry but it is the holy spirit of God that is the token that God requires of the church today God must see the token he must see it in every one of us amen the you know the death Angels coming and that was part of the Third Exodus right in this Exodus like there's you know a coldness in the church coming but by faith we want to apply just even like what was ministered this morning I say God let me tear down all of the walls that I've been building on other foundations and let me just revisit and come back to the sh Foundation amen excuse me says this he says now therefore living in the shadows the Wrath ready to strike God is requiring a token that you yourself received his token the Holy Ghost and that's the only way the only sign that God ever will pass because it is the literal life of Jesus returning back into the believer my there's no gray area there that's right that's the very Life of Christ that's pushing out in you why do you hunger why do you thirst what is that pushing you that's the life of Christ and he's saying I want to be on display praise God that's what communion is about remembering our sacrifice it's a perfect sacrifice Amen to bring you into Perfection and now how can there be any more perfect sacrifice than God himself becoming the atonement himself when God was made flesh in his own creative blood that it the only way that life the life of God could ever come back because all of us were born by sex therefore the life that is the life therefore the life that's in there is of the world and that life will not stand it's the thing that's already been judged and condemned it can't patch it up there's no way to patch it up there's no way to smooth it out there's no way to make it better it's got to die and that's the only requirement there is it's got to die and the substitute a Life of Christ Jesus Christ has come into you which is the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of his son Jesus Christ amen praise God for that because my you know the good thing about applying the blood and having the token life on display it gives you a confidence yes like as brother Billy was stating there's certain things that we do that we build on it it's shaky it's there's no confidence but this brings a certain satisfaction and an assurance amen that the the death angel it can come but I I've I've identified myself with the cross of Calvary with Jesus Christ the perfect lamb amen and it's no longer I that liveth amen but it's Christ in me 96 it says it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the Bride In Christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of Christ is the same remember the former tretis o theopus that I wrote unto you that Jesus being began to do and continue to do his death didn't stop him no sir he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the Holy Ghost to continue the work and continue on said the books of Acts Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the Lord boy I tell you when I when I have loved ones and and I just testify I had a a loved one who was in the hospital and they said that she had a brain tumor and there you know she was blind and you know they were they like we're going to have to operate and we don't know what's going to happen and you know just God dealing with your heart praise God that God deals with our heart and we we have a hunger to see the supernatural we we need we need God to come on this scene for our loved ones and I just there and I I just believe the word I take what I know is is the word of God and I had a little piece of a handkerchief and I started talking to her I said you know why do you want to be healed do you want to serve God you want to she's just like yeah you know I Want to Be Free I'll serve God I believe and I just laid that handkerchief on her and I prayed and I had an assurance there's something in my heart that just believe God was on the scene that it wasn't me doing it cuz his word said to do it and so I applied that to my life and you know what we got results she never had to have the surgery she went on to have a family her life wasn't finished and snuffed out right there because somebody applied the token somebody believed the word of God and put it into action that's that's what we want to do tonight we want to see God moving on the scene for our loved ones God has given us the instruction we want to take it to heart we want Christ to rise up and Inspire Us by the love of God to see the faith of God move us out of these routines out of these traditions we want to get excited about what God's doing in our personal life not just in a church service yeah W praise the Lord I love this Paul said and this is in 135 he said Paul said I though I give my body to be burned as a sacrifice I give all my goods to feed the poor and I have not and I have faith to move mountains and so speak with tongues as men as angels and all the these other things I have nothing until the token has been applied until this token that's what I'm speaking of tonight the love now until this has been applied I am nothing my to think that that token is the love of God I can't tell you how many times when there's a desperate cry and I don't even look at whether the person's a believer or not you know it's I'm looking on the inside amen that's where we want to look one of these days if you don't know it now one of these days you're going to realize there's God on the Inside Man 149 says see what I mean see the scriptures is speaking of here if the token was not displayed the Covenant was not in effect see it must be because if you you say you're a Believer and don't follow the instructions of the word you don't believe see though you be circumcised though you join though you are baptized you've done all these things like that it's still ain't the token the Holy Ghost my well just it's it's just time to check up you know I just for me personally I was looking at it I'm like my when when I think about applying my heart to wisdom I got to thinking about what it says in James you know James said I believe it's in chapter one in verse 26 and 27 but like our religion is in vain if we're not visiting the Widow and the father Liv I mean there's certain things that like when the love of Christ strikes your heart you're not concerned about your life and I I had to I just examine myself you know we're human we we get busy we get doing stuff and that's why I say just like what was preached this morning God let me apply the token let me apply the token to my heart because I know that it'll do for me what you said it would and to think about the how that that message came at the evening time and maybe if we can get to it I'll just try to turn this corner but he says this he says in 187 the message of the hour is a sign to the church the sign to the people are you catching it I hope on the tape you're going to do the same thing see other parts of the world it's a sign is here there is a token and it's got to be applied no other time time could it have been notice God's preparation for that time now as we know that the Bible said that those things are happenings for examples you see notice when God was ready to judge Egypt first he made preparation what did he do at the first and he never changes his order the first time when he got he made his preparation he sent a prophet with a message first thing he done to his people was send a prophet with a message amen and the next thing he done he identified the prophet and sent a pillar of fire for identification to identify it and the third thing he sent was the token and that's exactly right the token what did the token mean Assurance praise God we're a people that we're sure we're certain this was not a man that made that picture he testified George J Lacy testified the light struck the lens this should bring this reality that God is fixing to send the judgment on the Land There is a spiritual death that is creeping on the land we must apply the token amen but this token meant Assurance amen he says in 194 he says now look just to believe is not enough not to walk around it isn't enough you make yourself worse for to know to do good and doeth it not to him is sin see the borderline Believers Jesus spake in the same thing my goodness but it says this in 203 says but we must have the token do you hear BR Brandon Tabernacle you must display the token and without it all you're believing is in vain see a good you can live a good life listen to the word and go to church and try to live right that's fine but that's not it see when I see the blood that is the token and the token here is not because it's the the actual chemistry because the life is gone he had gone from it it was an animal but here it is his own life that is in the blood and the chemistry was a signal or a sign of sanctification but the life itself is the token and without the circumcision without the token it's not the covenant not even in the Covenant the whole thing works together and if you if you say you're circumcised to the word and it's the only and you believe the word if you believe the word then the token has got to come see he said repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost there you are amen I thank God for the preparation that God made sending the message vindicating it with his presence the pillar of fire and it brings an assurance amen and if we don't have that Assurance tonight I just we'll read on a little bit more because brother brandham gives us the application how do we apply the token are you interested I'm interested I want to I want to apply this token I want to be identified with My Sacrifice the victories I had yesterday were great praise God but I got a victory today I'm looking for God to give me vision and food so that I can strengthen myself for the battle in front of me the Devil he's still out prowling he's trying to bring spiritual coldness amongst us as individuals but praise God God's given us a message Hallelujah 222 he says um or 221 let's then the prophet said I have heard from God there will be a token and you put the blood upon the door slay the lamb put the blood upon the door and it'll be a token because death is fixing the strike let me tell you today as a servant unless the token is on the door there is a spiritual death going to strike and all the churches are headed back to the council the world Council of churches they're all going back to Catholicism amen and the only those who are genuine Born Again are going to stay out amen praise God praise God we can apply the token amen my we're going to speed up here all well we just skipped a lot so you know it's about that love of God you know that's what we're capping off and that's what we're talking about applying the love of God letting it live out that's what we want on display is the Life of Christ God is love amen no greater love that a man had that he lay his life down for his friends amen he showed us the example and that's in you that Fountain is in you to lay your life down you have that lame nature in you I have that lame nature in me it says this in 3 45 he says let me be a brother let me live the example of what Christ said a man should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister let me be a minister to ministers to the ministers let me be an example of examples let me show to the world that this word is Christ the only way I can do it is to come into him CU I can't do it myself you can't do it but let the word and you become one then it lives itself out you are a walking Epistle of Jesus Christ then you've got to then he's got complete control control of you to make every word amen if he comes this way I want to do this you say no no I don't believe that then you're not in the word yet see full watch now watch full now full obedience to the word of God entitles you entitles us to the Token then when we pay we pray we have the token and present it with our prayer if you say I pray Lord but really I have well you don't but you might well stop go ahead first get the token token cuz the token is what he recognizes see now when we pray then we must present the token Lord I have obeyed you fully I have repented of my sins and I feel that you have forgiven me I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Ghost is upon me and now I have a certain thing I have a certain thing for your glory Lord I ask it it is mine and then there's something that anchors back woohoo it's yours that does it then it's over it's all over it's settled ask for this and ask for it and it must see you want it for your Glory see well that it's he gives it to you then you know it's yours and that's the way it is our children and so forth apply the blood believe it all right amen I just thank the Lord that you know brother brandham just has a simple way of doing it and that's how simple it really is to apply the token just like he said I present God I know I've repented of my sins how many repented of their sins how many's been baptized in Jesus name how many of you know the spirit of God is on you how many of you know that if you ask and it's to bring glory to God you can have what you ask that's applying the token 364 says to apply it say Lord I'm going after my son I'm going after my daughter daughter I claim her Satan you turn her loose I'm coming after her I apply my token the Holy Spirit oh holy spirit that lives in me catch my daughter there I'm going to her now with the anointing on me he'll do it amen 372 he says Get Ready apply the token believe it clean up let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you amen that's right it'll take effect yes sir then apply the token in prayer with consolation with believing apply it with such love and so forth till you know it's going to take it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing it's going to help that's what the the tokens come to give you assurance that you can apply the token believing with confidence it's going to be the Difference Maker when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband when you talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe it's going to help just stand there and say Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm getting them for you Lord apply it and create that atmosphere around you that'll just drop right in they'll jum drop right into it see there you are you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold to it see that's it apply the token then walk with it claim your household you must do it now this is the evening time now you've been listening for a long time see a apply the the applying time is now the Wrath will strike one of these days and it might be too late then apply the token with confidence amen praise God we're going to go ahead and just wind down here but I just wanted to encourage you you know to and it says this in 131 or 381 it says this apply the token then serve the Living God I think that's great instruction you know I think that God put us in a position where he's leading us because there's a desire in our heart you know like David said you know I thirst for the Living God we're not looking for something that's dead and something that's far away but some new land I I I know for myself part of the vision of what I'm Desiring is it's not just about what where I've experienced God in the past but you know sometimes when you go out into another realm of life and God wants to pull you into you're kind of uncomfortable things kind of feel shaky you're kind of not really certain about what's next but you're certain of God yeah but if we'll just apply the token and say God I'm going to trust you if I do this with confidence you might actually cause me to be on the Forefront of the battle and also I'm going to be there with the reality is is that I have a blood atonement I have that sacrifice that I've applied to my heart and I know that he's redeemed me and that he's doing this work amen that's what I believe that in my heart is craving for is to serve the Living God in this manner for a living Works living signs signs that heal the sick that raise the dead that foretell things speak in tongues interpret every time perfectly right prophesy these things such things will happen show the signs in the heavens amen speaking exactly like the Bible would take place serving the Living God Amen apply the token amen as we turn the service over to brother Billy I just wanted you to just kind of be pondering those things as we take communion you know it says to remember you know the Lord and the sacrifice that he made and I just believe that as we do that we can claim our loved ones you know there's healing and communion but you can also apply that token with faith believing and watch how God doesn't just orchestrate circumstances when you go to claiming that god-given right amen amen Lord bless you as we turn the service over to brother Billy maybe we can all [Music] stand maybe we'll have the musician come I like that song so much the there is a blood I I think that's is is a good reminder of what that blood really represents that we've been redeemed we've been freed from the guilt and the shame and we can go serving the Living God Amen why don't we bow our heads together our precious Lord what a privilege it is to know that we've passed from Death to life and we have have within us Lord the token that when the death angel is passing Lord we're safe Lord it gives us such a comfort and joy but father we don't want to just put that on the Shelf Lord we want to let it go into action Lord and so we pray you'd help us as we take communion tonight father I pray that you would oh God remember us Lord in this time that we can oh God put this life of Christ on this lay father help each one Lord that's here tonight as they take communion I pray you'd speak to them in their personal way how they can act upon these words of our Prophet father we just commit them to you pray your blessings upon them in Jesus name and sing [Music] this is that CA [Music] and made my [Music] way death it when it FL down from the cross my sins were gone my sins for God there is a grave that tries [Music] to his precious love that me every day he bre the and lo his in Mighty so my God to tell you [Music] he the fall W and so I come to tell you that say to shout and to Proclaim that is coming man for you oh there is a BL oh that sight the blind oh he heals her sck the lon oh we has the power to free the bound oh as chains of fall upon the ground oh pour it out Hallelujah cleanse my soul oh and let it liquid Glory flow oh and because it live to make me whole I ow my life I ow my own so I can to tell you he a alive to tell you that it Dr every of all oh so I come to tell you that is said to shout and to Proclaim that is coming back for you Hallelujah aren't you glad for the blood am aren't you glad for the token amen for which without we would have never had an access amen it's the blood that gives us the access amen and I love that it's to be put on display when the token is on display it shows that there's a work that took place here it shows that something a lamb has died in that household and that's what he wants us to do andam says a token which is the sign it says it provides security when there's blood there it means I'm not going to die it means my sins have been paid for it means I'm good amen it means that I belong to somebody it it means ownership it means that this one is being taken care of and I just want to say this as our brother was speaking I I just think the devil so many times he wants to keep our eyes on ourselves where if we're not careful we become Catholics you know oh Father I've done wrong and father I've done wrong no he saved you he wants you to go out there and do some work yeah he wants us to go to battle well if you get wounded he'll take care of you you know otherwise we're just going to oh Lord I I sin again oh Father I confess my no he doesn't want us to be that way he wants us to be Sons and Daughters once a son you cannot change you're not there's not enough sin to change you from a son to a servant you are a son you are in a son forever amen I just feel and as our brother was talking and and that's why you you bury the burdens of others you you're there because something has been done to you you want to do to others you want to see God move and and you not just satisfy in containing it because even this flesh cannot contain it you just want to speak out from the the mountain and shut it out so everybody will know that there's a living God and that's why we testify that's why when we meet somebody in need we say why because we believe the token has been applied that I have been taken care of God has taken care of me and I need to go out there and do the same and Proclaim that same message so others will hear amen man let's turn our Bibles for our communion scripture reading as the brothers will get ready let's turn to 1 Corinthian 11 and chapter uh the the 23 verse um says for I have received of the Lord that which I also deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is a new testony in my blood he said this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup do Ye Ye do show the Lord's Mercy the Lord's death till I come wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he for he that that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten off the Lord that we should be we should not be condemned with the world wherefore Brethren when ye come together to eat Terry one for another and if any any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come man man don't forget the instruction so for these two rows just go around and you know come in the middle middle we want at least to come uh form two rows that you come to eat so that way it could go as quick as possible and then if you are between these two rows you just come in the middle form two rows and then come and eat it amen our gracious father we're so thankful Lord and Lord to just have access to the communion Lord that you have given us and father Tonight We Gather here not because of our sufficiency but all sufficiency Belong To You Lord but Lord You've Made A Way scripture says that an entrance will be ministered unto you into the Everlasting Kingdom father it's by the blood of the Lamb that was shed as we heard tonight you shed the blood and and father we we have received and eaten of that lamb and applied of that blood and and Lord there therefore we believe that Lord you've called us through that and we pray father as we take this communion father God we pray that this blood which represents your body Lord father your your Prophet will tell us that there's healing in communion that's Deliverance in communion father we never want to come to take it under condemnation but we want to come and take it for all the benefits that we can get off of it we believe that this is a Commandment that you give and we as a children of God we have access and when we take it Lord that your promises will follow after bless this Blood oh God the the wine oh God that's representative of your blood and which representative of the stimulation of the Revelation Lord that as we take it Lord that every benefit that could be drawn off of this that we may receive it tonight father remember those that are not with us tonight and we pray father you be with them and as we take it Lord may we go out of here Lord and better than the way we came in that each one that will take it Lord may you just strengthen them and heal them Lord that they may come testimonies of your greatness of the things that you do we love you Lord and we ask these things as we pray for one another in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen man you may be seated and if if the musician could come man if

where we want to be here in the Cliff of the rock near him let's all stand as we read amen our foot washing scripture and let John Chapter 13 and going to start from verse one it said now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that isawa was come and that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended and the devil have put into the heart of Judas is car at Simon son Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that he had that the father had given all things unto his hand that he was come from God and he went to God I love that so he knew that he raised it from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and GED himself and after he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet and wiped them with a towel wherewith it was GED then come to Simon Peter uh Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do that knoweth not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash the not thou has no part worth me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but my but also my hands and my head Jesus said said to him he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every with ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and and taken His Garment and sat down again and he said unto them know ye what I have done to you ye call me master and Lord and ye said well for sure I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also are to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should also do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if ye know these things happy are ye if you do them amen the sisters will go through the place the brothers will stay and we'll gather together right after the foot washing amen for
