fellowship with you we're so grateful father we ask that what we're here we can fight the good fight of faith that your love would be shed abroad into our hearts that we can share you father with those that are in need father pre-adventure that they too might be hungering and longing for your presence father guide our footsteps for we know they are ordered by you father we just ask that our atmosphere would be one such that was pleasing to you father help us to grow in you we pray in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we've been studying our little uh study here in Nehemiah so let's go back and read the ninth verse here of this great scripture and watch it unfold the forest and thank you person God is so good he said then he we remember we read in the eighth verse that um he is now beseeching the Lord and he's praying to the Lord he's heard that Jerusalem it lays in waste a great portion of it still uh that the labor has ceased their uh for the people in Jerusalem have grown cold and formal and they have no leadership and so the and they're in sore condition and there's a lot of critics and reproach and mockery going on and it it just tears Nehemiah up and so now he's praying the Lord he says remember I beseech Thee the word that thou commandest thy servant Moses saying if ye transgress I will scatter you abroad among the Nations so he has discerned that that they have been scattered abroad and because of that he knows the reason that they've been scattered abroad was because they didn't keep his Commandments so that's the first thing he acknowledges he acknowledges the existing condition that the word described Lord we're sorry that we sinned that's why we are where we are in the shape that we're in we accept that it's our fault you know it's it's not the other guy's fault it's our fault you know it wasn't the other guys that were out of the will of the lord we were out of the Will O Lord we're the ones that gave them occasion to come in against us why because we let our wall down and so that's what we're talking about the path of restoration and so then he goes on to say this he says but if he turn unto me and keep my commandments so now what is he doing he's carrying out the word he's turning unto the Lord he's following the pattern he's following the word it's not just in his mind but he's actually putting it to practice in his life so if the scripture says call out unto the Lord call out if the scripture says let your voice be known let it be known you know I mean you could bring the word into flesh form and so if then he says here he said that if we turn unto me and keep my Commandments and do them though there were of You cast out unto the uttermost parts of the heaven I will gather them from fence and bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there father we'd ask your blessing on the word your precious name we pray amen may be seated um go again I'm I love history though uh history is hard for me because history is full of names nobody has and uh they're all tongue twisters and they count backwards and you know so the smaller the date the longer it is and and so all that stuff always been difficult to me uh I I always loved geography because the mountains didn't go nowhere you know you could stay with those but so we're following this story here of the burden that came on nehemiah's heart because he has a desire to see Israel and Jerusalem restored so we know that when the children of Israel just a brief story we know that the children of Israel after 400 years captivity in Egypt we know how we they got there there was a famine in the land Abraham sent his sons and and we know that Joseph was set there to prepare pharaoh and finally the rest of his brothers came to uh Egypt and when they saw it was good they took their father and they brought them all down and they dwelt in the land of Egypt and they could go out there until a pharaoh came and didn't know their name and they were held in captivity and so as they were held in captivity there for those 400 years God sent Moses and Moses delivered them with a mighty hand amen just think if God before you who can be against you the whole world can be against you but God will go exceedingly and abundantly beyond what the world can even ask or think and so he delivered them out and so when they went to a Mount Sinai and they were on their way to the promised land and God spoke to him we know that they immediately fell back Israel has always had a problem and it's a type of the Church of being distracted by the world part of why we're going through this history is so that we can understand because we're talking about having a faith restored that it doesn't matter what's happening in history God's plan is is on its path also and and he's going to raise up men and women all down through this journey in order to keep his plan moving and and and and and bringing people and bringing involvement and he changes the course of history when he needs to change it in order that his word might be fulfilled and so we know if we follow the history of the children of Israel that they they come to the place and they get the Ten Commandments and they have the Ark of the Covenant and they told them what they need they put the Commandments in there and they have this art of the Covenant and we know that at that time dwelt in behind Badger skins we know the story David tried to bring the Ark in and he was supposed to be carried on the shoulders of the priest and we we know those stories of how that then after that man died they sent the ark and they set it aside and David had a desire in his heart to build a temple but so in the meantime Israel was growing they were in a land filled with milk and honey they're surrounded by the the amorites the Hittites and all these are these uh uh descendants of Ishmael and they're in different tribes and they're in different uh Nations and different kingdoms and these kingdoms are small but they're growing in population the world is growing it's increasing in number education is increasing science is increasing the civilization is on the move and it's increasing and so we find out that that the the tribes of Israel they all United and decided they wanted a king and that King they chose was Saul and they chose Saul because he was a mighty warrior and and they wanted somebody who could fend off the enemies that kept coming in and Samuel withstood him and said wait a minute God's been our defense all this time he's far fought our battles and he's saying if you get a king he's going to take your sons and put them into the army he's going to take your daughters and put him into servitude he says you're going to have to pay taxes and everything that they chose to have man rule over him because they wanted to build a kingdom they wanted to have an army protect them they wanted to move from something that was spiritually going to protect them to something carnal that they could tell they could know they were safe because there was safety in numbers they could know that they were a kingdom because they were prospering economically and God had already promised them you take care of the lead elevates I'll take care of you that was God's covenant with them and you can read all these great laws so we know that that what took place then is that you know again uh the Philistines came and to David Rose out and he slew the Philistines and it built fear amongst all the little countries around and Saul's Kingdom grew but we know again that the stories of of of Israel we won't go into all of them but Saul was eventually slain and they put David as king and David's heart's desire was to build the temple and to have a place that the ark could dwell that the presence of God would be and so uh Nehemiah is referring to that Temple place where God dwelled and we know when Solomon prayed his prayer that the whole Temple was filled with the presence of God that's where the high priest went into the ark and he had to have the rope and Bell tied upon him and and all the great Traditions around the presence of God being there but God is fixing to change at the end of this Exodus so these are all the fruits of the first Exodus of them coming out of of uh Egypt going in and having a land and building a temple where the ark dwells in but we know soon that God is going to change that Dwelling Place he's not going to dwell in the temple anymore but he's now going to dwell in a man and it's going to turn from the temple dwelling to him saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased as well and later even for us as Gentiles that he would now move in and and dwell in us so as as the is as the Jewish Kingdom is growing and David's David has his uh uh uh uh Kingdom and now his kingdom goes to Saul I mean this uh to Solomon it was a glorious golden age for Israel he was wise he knew how to do business he had treasuries and wealth and they prospered and they were in prosperity and and and he ruled in this golden age and it was beautiful but when he finally came down to and it was one United Kingdom Israel there was basically we saved kind of three provinces were all in it a Galilee and then Samaria and Judea but all that was Israel and they were all United under King Solomon and they were glorious age and people came to seek the wisdom you know these stories of your Bible but we're just talking of this because we want us all to understand that the world is still going on do you understand there's activity in politics and civilizations and conquest and rumors of war and almost if I could say it like today the world's going on it's still doing things but in the midst of the world God's Eternal plan is unfolding and can unbelief doesn't stop God circumstances doesn't stop God he knows what he's going to accomplish he's going to accomplish it and what men thinks are their great works and their Great accomplishments are only small little tools in the great plan of God to bring his eternal purpose to pass so we know what happens Solomon goes off the scene and his son rail Bond takes over but he's a harsh King and and he he he despises the people of the north and so they Rebel and the Kingdom of Israel is divided in two parts it what was referred to as Israel which is uh Galilee and Samaria and Judea to the South so rareboam takes a hold of Jerusalem jeroboam takes the North and we know it's not wrong until jeroboam gets mixed up in all kinds of stuff they doesn't the fam they don't stay with the word of God they'll get involved in adultery and all those things so now we're at the place where we talked this this morning the Syrian Kingdom comes in remember Syria was before Babylon okay so the Assyrian kingdom comes in and they take all of the north of Samaria into captivity and Judah if the country of Judah is left to strive on its own so in that time the syrians then eventually prepare a prevail against Judea and it's all swallowed up in the Syrian Kingdom but about that same time that Civil War is going on within Syria and Nebuchadnezzar Rises up and Babylon takes over Syria Nebuchadnezzar's the king and he goes and he goes over and he enters in to that portion of the Syrian country and raids the temple destroys the temple steals all the vessels all the gold everything out of it and and takes it and and and we know the great Bible stories that that follow and they're over there just making mockery of God and we know the children of Israel Shadrach neshach and Abednego and the stories that begin to fall in the scripture so we're to the point now then what takes place is Babylon now is the power that controls uh Jerusalem because they've captured the ground the syrians had the leadership of Syria has changed in the Babylonian leadership they're under captivity now we're reading our story at that time Cyrus came and he came and took all of that Kingdom and even more and so now we find where Nehemiah is so we know that what we're seeing here is God's plan and leading all the countries of the world all falling in place civilization because God's preparing another Exodus for his children but this is not going to be a a physical Exodus it's going to be a spiritual Exodus it's going to be an exodus of Faith it's going to be an exodus of Revelation it's going to be an exodus of of a new relationship so it's going to be coming out of the law into the spirit of Grace it's going to come out of the leadership of the law to the leadership of the holy spirit so we see here in looking at this how the politics of the world and civilization of the world and everything is actually going down its course in this history is is coming to pass really with a purpose that God has in his mind we know Alexander the Great comes and he takes over the Persian Kingdom the Persian Kingdom gets broke up and then who comes marching along Rome now Rome has control of the world they think who's got control of the kingdoms amen they're his we know that Satan's the ruler of the air and the prince and all those Kingdom but they're all working together to the good of God's elect you're not going to deceive God's elect they're predestinated to come just like those Jews that were in Israel at the time they was under the conquest of Rome everything was the planned so that the angel could appear to marry and Joseph would inspouse her he would take her to Bethlehem they would be born the Shepherds would shout his veins they would go to Egypt everything Herod would slay the children that were spoken in the scripture all this political stuff that's going on isn't stopping God and just like we've got to and that's what we're talking about the path to Restoration we've got to rise up by looking at God's word and saying wait a minute God's Got A Plan he's got a faith I want my faith to be restored in God's word that I can be a part of what God's performing and not let whatever it appears to be going on in the world hinder me banks are crashing what do you do when your bank crashes you go to the scripture that reads I'll not suffer my my holy ones a righteous man shall not beg bread the Lord's supply of all my needs you return back to the word of God because what he says is reality it's not perception yes I I just heard a commentator the other day say as we all know perception is reality I thought you lying Neville no God's word is reality you want to get a better glimpse of reality for our day really what's going on go listen to Satan's Eden go listen to God of this evil age go listen to The Invisible Union of the Bride tree and and the bride of Christ you find out here's Satan building his eating and yet here's God's got all these wonderful promises for this personal Union and and power that he's going to employ and and Pastor the believer that they can do the same works that he's doing and what we've got to understand is that we've got a great restoration coming and we've got to get on that path to Restoration and participate in the things that we need to have within our lives to allow that restoration to come past in us so what we're seeing now as we're talking about the the not only just the restoration of Jerusalem but in ourselves the restoration of building our walls and our gates and not letting our hedge down and that's exactly scriptural because when Satan came to Jesus he said he said have you considered my servant job he says that's because you built the Hedge around them he said no say let me tell you he's genuine you can do whatever you want to him except take his life now here's Joby sitting on a dung Heap he's full of boils his wife's saying why don't you just curse God and die but there's something about Joe he's all through this suffering he's learning more about God he's understanding The Rose the the flower that goes in and comes out and he he says you speak as a foolish woman he says the lord giveth the lord taketh away it blessed be the name of the Lord he's he knows he made the sacrifices for sin his accusers are accusing him of sin but he knows the Integrity of God's word and finally he starts entering the Revelation in all his suffering and finally comes to the place he says though the skin won't eat my flesh yet I'll see God he sees the lightning flashing and he's moved on upon God and then he's restored a hundred fold it's it's a fabulous story of the path of jobs restoration okay it's our hearts that desire so we we pick up where we're at now because uh Nehemiah is heartbroken he's gotten the news that Israel still lays in ruins the walls are all still crumbled down the gates are are burnt the temple has been built but the people are still in disarray he's burdened and he prayed the Lord and we and he said and I pray thee thy servant this day the 11th verse and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's cup Bearer and it came to pass we'll start reading in the second chapter and it came to pass in the month of nasan that the 20th year of exers King that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been Before Time sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto me why is thy continent sad seeing Thou Art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then I was very sore afraid you know you can put all these different types you can place in there but I I like this that the king recognized your continents and let me tell you the power of your continents and you know what that means your atmosphere your attitude it could very very powerful thing in fact the scripture even tells us that people may inquire of you what is your hope that you you you you have such joy and confidence and peace amidst all this suffering you know what is it what is it you've got we know the story that was told about the Rancher the farmer and the in his hand and he the farmer wanted to know why he was so happy and why he was so blessed and he said it's the Lord boss he says do you want him he says yes I want to meet him and he'd go out and climb over the fence and go kneel down the middle of the pigpen and the boss will get up there and he'd start going through that mind battle and him being out there kneeling in the pig flop and with his great boots on and everything and he just pulled back but it just kept burning in his soul the peace and the joy that that this little farmhand had and the effect it was having on him and so much so that finally one day he said okay he started over the fence he said hold on Boss you don't really have to come here you just got to want to do it and be able to he led him to the Lord and he passed the peace that he had in his life unto others you can live a gospel and preach a gospel without saying a word you are written Epistles read of all men amen and and I'm not a a very good uh I don't want to use the term you know they call it poker face but that's because you're trying to Bluff and and con somebody you know usually if I get upset it's all over my face you know and someone will say well what are you upset about nothing you know your continents speaks loud if you're happy people know you're happy you're red well I want people to read me if the if the spirit of the Lord's in me and I want I want it to what my attitude is and what my nature is I want that to be a billboard you know program called that beautiful message okay about the billboard being the advertisement of our lives that were every single one of us is a billboard for the Lord that we ought to make those around us thirsty for what we have and so this King he he sees him and he says and and he said I was sore afraid and said unto the king let the King live forever and in one way he was saying I'm sorry I'm let the King live forever I'm sorry that my continents upset you because he he was afraid because he saw that his attitude his nature had an effect on one that could take his life if he so decided he had the fear of God and do you know the fear of God's the beginning of wisdom if if you can learn and I need to learn it to pray this for me that that I need to be mindful of the words I speak the attitudes that I have the nature that I that I present that I need to be in fear of God can you understand that that I I don't displease him and I think one of the greatest things that the Lord says he said I only do those things which are pleasing to the father Lord help me get to that place I think it would make a difference of the attitude I walked in the atmosphere have you ever been around somebody that everything's woes me oh I can't get no help with this and woes me I have to do all this and oh my life is so burdened you know and I I think that gets old you know well you wonder what what do you have you know life is such a trust struggle raising kids is so hard well you know we we raise four of the most ordinary kids known to mankind and some of you are laughing but you know it's true and uh and uh I mean they was always up to something it you know we had four kids in five years you know what I mean we take care of business and move on and uh they were I mean my goodness gracious but you know Leslie never complained never complained about raising them up never complained about the stuff they went through you know what I mean I asked her many times which one do you want me to eliminate so that that life would be easier for you and all she wanted every single one of them there you know uh we are paying eight hundred dollars a month for car insurance because they would wreck every car we bought them you know what if something but we had a promise that if we'd raise them up in the way that they'd go that they had returned to that way it took a while but God kept his word and and and don't worry do you know if you've kept your part we've already heard the scriptures say if you kept his Commandments and you returned to him though they get as far away as the heavens could be I will gather them back in your kids can't get too far from God that God can't touch them and so he's sore afraid and he's saying uh so let the King live forever I I'm sorry for this but he said why should not my continents be sad when the city the place of my father's sepulchers lieth waste and the gates there are are consumed with fire now I like this part a lot then the king said unto me for what does thou make request so I prayed to the god of Heaven look the king Saints is this a request or is it a complaint you know there's a big difference between asking for something if things aren't right don't complain about it I I just to be honest with you so you can know me I I don't like criticism of every any form nobody likes to be criticized but I certainly don't like criticism that doesn't have a solution that ain't no good okay what do I do about it you know well you might say well this is the way I would do it well that's good I accept that you know we we all know the rule right there's two ways to do everything the right way the wrong way in my way that that's our nature but you don't want criticism if someone's not going to help you I think we call that constructive criticism so he the Kings ask him he says are you complaining what's the request what's the request so when you find yourself in a place of Sorrow you find yourself back that you find yourself discouraged you find yourself down you find yourself in a place that you don't want to be you find yourself burdened whatever it is maybe a failure you've had has put you in a place of Burden you feel backslid you feel beat down you feel away from God the question isn't well what is what's your request what can I help you with what can I do about it this is such a relationship of if of the King Typing Our Father in heaven and his son having a burden and a need whether it's for himself to be right because now Nehemiah wants to get back to where he can start worshiping God keeping his Commandments he's wanting to be restored back to the to the life that he was brought up in and he wants it for his Brethren he wants Israel to return back to the father and he wanted to do something that he can do to help bring it to pass and he knows if Jerusalem can rise up he knows that the children can gather around there and that they can start worshiping God and start keeping the feast and start doing the Commandments that Moses given so he's his desire is for a Revival to break out if I could say it that way but he's got to make his request known so the king's asking him you know you could read it kind of the way I do I read it like is that a request or what's the request what are you saying well I'm saying the place is wrecked maybe oh I wrecked my car is that a request do you need Carr any prayer do you need a ride part of restoration is making your requests known we have not because we asked not because we don't believe that God could answer the prayer so yeah I think it's a great question the king says what what what request is thou what does thou make request so I can pray to the god of Heaven and I said unto the king if it pleased the king and If thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou May Ascend me unto Judea and unto the city of my father's Sepulcher that I might build it I love it I might restore it that I might do something for the kingdom of God and the King said unto me the queen also setting by him for how long shall that journey be and when will thou return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time he gave the king his word your word is gold if you don't promise something that you can't keep at least say Lord willing but if foolish man says I'll do this and I'll do that and I'll do this and I'll do that Lord willing if everything goes well you know what I mean this is our plan by the grace of God but Lord willing always acknowledge who's in charge and who's in control and and and and and what it means and so he gave his King his word he says I set a time a time for his departure a time for his return what that he was going to do what he purposed it and and I think the beautiful part of this that we have to understand he established his motive and objective a lot of people ask things and want things done and they've got something up their sleeve you know he didn't have anything up his sleeve he was laying it out to the King this is what I want to go for this is what I want to do this is the burden of my heart I'm not hiding anything from you there's nothing up my sleeve okay this is the plan that I'm going to carry out I'm committed to it I'm not hiding I'm full disclosure I'm full in view I've got no secrets I'm open this is my View it's so important that not only that you know where you stand but others know where you stand that the first way to gain respect so many people here they're so wishy-washy in and out up and down you don't know what to believe when they tell you because they don't have a life that matches up so this is a man that God's place there he's prepared himself God prepared him he prepared himself now he's in the place to go into action and in order to go into action he's got to make his requests made known to the Lord what it is that he wants you all know the scriptures about what the Lord teaches ask the father anything of my name he'll give it always encouraging us to ask ask for the things that will help you on your journey to the kingdom don't be embarrassed if you need it he already knows you need it he wants to enter into the fellowship of supplying your needs because he's Jehovah jirei he's Jehovah Rapha he's a a Lord that supplyth our needs he's our healer all the Redemptive names of Jehovah are all summed up in the Lord Jesus Christ and so he's watching Nehemiah go through all the right steps of restoration honesty making his requests everything about him becomes beautiful and he just as he moves on here and moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given me to to the governors beyond the river that they might can convey me over till I come unto Judea he's got to pass through all the lands God across the river Euphrates the Tigris Rivers the universe rephraties go all the way over across Jordan you could look at the map so his his journey is about 670 miles that would kind of be as the we'd say the crows fly but it took Nehemiah 14 years earlier it it took him 900 miles of Road and four months of travel to get to Jerusalem to build the temple that is commitment for the full Journey and God will sometimes test us he'll put time in between the request how long did Abraham how about Noah how about the things that people required and were asking for and God puts if I could say this word maybe an endurance course right because faith and love they endureth all things they don't give up on their Pursuit okay and and don't give up on the pursuit of Excellence that's what makes it excellent failure is what produces an excellent product if if there's not failure sometimes if there's not a a stress test and a test to prove something and if it's never been proven you can't have confidence in it but if you watch somebody go through struggles after struggle and they still stay firm and they still praise God they rise up they keep going they're their goal you don't mind that they've got problems you don't mind that they're fighting the good fight you don't mind their failures because you know they're not going to quit they're persistent and and this man knew what set out before him that he was persistent because he's trying to put everything that he could do to make it come to pass and so he asked the king for these letters and and so he sent these letters and and the letters unto ask for The Keeper of the king's Forest that he might give me timbers to make beams for the gates of the palace where which apprehendeth to the house and for the walls of the city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me don't forget to give credit to those that God uses to help you if you have a boss that employs you pray for him give them credit don't run them to the ground you know okay don't you know if God gives you a job and you hate it you know what I mean it kind of tells me maybe you don't understand how God works you know you just don't sit back man I hate what I'm doing I hate what I'm doing well did you pray about it before you started it you know like if you didn't pray about before you started and God didn't give it to you and you just jumped in it because you were driven by desperation if you didn't know what Nehemiah did Nehemiah was going to go do something and the scripture tells us before you build something count the cost so he counted the cost he looked at what he needed he requested I'm going to need men I'm going to need Timbers I'm going to need these things and then he was relying on the goodness of God to provide for him you know we just saw this just recently in our building program so we we get a bit covet comes and we get a bid for trusses for our church trusses are the little roof pieces that goes on they wanted a hundred and ninety thousand dollars you don't think that was ain't no way of course if you say well what are we going to do we have to save the money someplace else or do something because we have a goal that we're trying to meet and you know and then you know everybody's fighting us and it's terrible and we just think the world's coming to an end and all that stuff and I want to hang everybody in the city and there can't be enough lightning fall down you know what I mean and and uh being you know I'm writing dirty letters to the city council you know I'm all stirred up what did I forget I forgot about the goodness of God right the scripture says if God begins a work he'll finish it that goes for me that goes for anything he's in and if he's in you and he started a work in you he'll finish the work in you so we went back out and we said okay I called the first company up that talked to man I said we're ready for those trusses now we want to put them in production can you here's the new print of what we're going to do and took the balcony out and here it is he writes me back he says that'll be forty thousand dollars that's a hundred and fifty thousand dollar different you don't think somebody's got timing I'm so glad that God didn't let me build this building but if he builds it it'll be according to his will according to his time according to his place but again don't forget to give glory to all those that help you and enable you and bless you they said George Washington wouldn't take a drink of water without thanking the lord he he appreciated it so much I thank the Lord he said so he said then I came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me I don't know the king's motive and objective of that but I think one thing the king wanted to do is he wanted to make sure he got there and carried out what his heart's desire do you ever think that just might be just like God in Camp in this angels around the righteous because the angels of the Lord are camped about them that fear Him and here you see it a man that feared God feared the king and he's been encamped about I I that just moves me I'm sorry I I get moved by some of the smallest things but it's just the little things that God does that just amaze me you know he just didn't send this guy with a letter but those guards went with him and you know why they went with him because they went to enforce the king's letter they weren't there necessarily for Nehemiah but Nehemiah was packing a letter from the King and to them men that was the law and if you didn't obey that letter they would Lop your head off they in their heart in their lives in their dedication and what they've chosen they were chosen to uphold the will of the king and that's what they were along for they were alone when he handed that letter to the king's ruler of the forest those captains is there when he gave them that letter them captains and them guys stood there and went chart chopping they were there to enforce the king's will aren't you glad you've got angels that are going to enforce the will of the Lord that are encamped about you that carry those if you're about his business our Prophet taught us that he will make a way oh I love it I just Thrills me I don't can't help myself I'm just a child when it comes to Bible stories but there they were they're gonna they were making sure that that King's letter that King's letter was was gold to them it was the will of their King we know some other guys that heard the will of the king one day don't we he said oh just to have a cup of water from that Brook oh those guys heard that all of a sudden you heard four or five horses Gallop off where was that Brooke it was on the other side of the enemy they slashed and cut their way through got to that well fending people off laying down they got that drink for their King off they went back across they brought it to David oh they said here King we overheard you say you wanted a glass of water David was moved by their allegiance he has moved by their Authority in fact he was so moved he didn't even feel worthy to drink that water because these men went through such an effort just to meet his request wouldn't it be wonderful if we had that kind of loved one for another that if we heard someone's burden or somebody's need that we would fight everything that we could to bring it to pass in their life David poured it out and the Lord and said Lord I'm not worthy to drink this water these men are greater than my feet then my thirst he saw every man better than themselves that's what that little verse means to me maybe I got more out of it than I should have but I think there's more in there I missed Hallelujah and when santaball sent a ball out I guess you guys make these names up for yourself okay because I I don't ever read them twice the same way I go to try to figure them out and they got little dots and little U's and little marks over there and I think am I supposed to know what that squiggly thing means I don't know how nobody taught me what they meant you know so it just looks like what it is you know San Baal lat and ho row night and to buy ha anybody else want to take a shot at it I'm I'm game this the servant and ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel isn't that a type of the hateful society that we live in today then if you seek the welfare of something oh you they got so many names for you that it's it's unbelievable and he said so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night and I and a few men with me neither told I any man what God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem neither was there any Beast with me save the Beast that I rode upon and I went out by night by the gate of the valley and before the dragon went and to the dunport and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof which were consumed with fire then I went to the gate of the foundation the fountain and to the king's pool but but there was no place for a beast that was under me to pass then I went up in the Night by the Brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley so I returned this is a man that wasn't boasting or seeking glory for himself he looked at the task and no doubt he might have not realized how big of a task it was or how bad the situation was but what did he have he prayed the king granted his journey he asked the king and the King gave him letters God didn't take him this far to fail and there was no boast in his life there was no look at me I'm here to do this I'm going to accomplish this great thing you know I'm a master builder he wasn't a master builder he was a cup Bearer he wasn't counting on him he was counting on God he didn't want to get the glory he wanted God to get the glory he he somehow must have felt in his spirit that he was part of a bigger accomplishment God wasn't built in Jerusalem up God was building Jerusalem up so his real son could go to read Jerusalem so he could be rejected he could be judged he could be found a sinner that he could go to the cross Jeremiah Nehemiah might not have understood all those things but he was compelled to do what he did and he did what he was compelled to do he didn't have to have an understanding of it he just believed that the part that God was playing in him and I'm afraid today too many of us have to know what tomorrow holds we have to know what the future holds we have to know how it's going to affect our stock market how it's going to affect our retirement we got so many things in the picture he didn't that burden still rang true he didn't tell nobody he didn't boast he didn't take no glory because it was the spirit of God moving in him God was going to use Nehemiah to build walls that were broke down all he was going to do was bring the word to them he surveyed it may I say this young people I know that marriage lies ahead of you I know job decisions lie ahead of you relationships lie ahead of you meetings that you go lie ahead of you survey the ground look at the country look what's there look what's ahead preview it don't walk blindly into things I I I just remember brother REM talked to that girl that can I I forget what she told them it's something about his hair well he's got wavy hair and brother man looked at says what's that got to do with it wavy hair how do you like my wavy hair you know what I mean wavy hair don't stay there he said what has that got to do with it look at the things that matter you understand he wasn't distracted he didn't all of a sudden decide what rather build Temple I'd rather build houses I'd rather do this he's stuck with his conviction stick with your convictions survey the ground ahead of you understand what lies ahead of you understand the job that you're commissioned to do and the things to do okay and if you wonder take something make sure it falls in a line with the will of God in your life and the work that God has for you to do it didn't matter I love the fact that he kept this secret I love the fact he went out at night and he saw it you know why he wasn't going to ask the people to do something that he hadn't experienced himself how many times have I heard people come to me and say oh I know exactly how it feels you're not old enough to know what it feels like to be in this body you haven't had the number of hurts you haven't done that I can't walk up to somebody who's Lost the Child and say I know how it feels because I don't I can sympathize I can be compassionate I can tell the Lord knows how it feels the father lost his son I could comfort him with the gospel you will see them again I've had to have several families had lost young children lost him at Birth lost them right after birth it's a hard time to get through but he gets us through them come back the task did not deter him it just made God greater and he stayed humble he knew what he was going to ask he knew what he was talking about he prayed and he had a plan and the Lord had given him the course to follow and so we find out that he entered uh back in the valley gated return and the rulers knew not wither I went nor what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priest nor to the Nobles nor to the rulers or nor to the rest of that did the work yeah I didn't even talk to him till I knew myself and then I said unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burnt with fire come let us build up the walls of Jerusalem that there be no more reproach come let us not I'm here to do this and I'm here to do that he didn't even tell him till he knew what he was saying he knew that God was capable and then he when he says look at where we're standing look at the reproach look at what they're doing look at this let's build this together let's stand up together to let us build up the wall of Jerusalem if one can put an army to flight two can put ten thousand us can do more than I us is a much better friend than me I would rather have we than me can humbly approached him he knew his position he knew he was a cup Bearer they could have scoffed at him say what do you know about building the only thing you've done is lived in a palace and and and and held a cup you know unbelievers will find some reason you can't do what you can do they'll find some reason you can't have a miracle they'll find some reason why the task is too big they'll find some reason they are Soulful in negativity that the scripture tells us and our Prophet tells him he says don't surround yourself with unbelievers he went to him he finally went to him and said let us build this wall together I like this a whole lot and there was a purpose for it that we be no more a reproach then there's a perfect time for everything because it shows motive and objective can let's rewrite the story I come riding in town I'm going to build a wall I got a letter from the King slave they'll probably take that off YouTube but you got it first I didn't right it's crazy but look at his approach look at his attitude he can't do it without them he's sharing his burden with him he's wanting what he's sharing with them is for them to take the reproach off to give you a place you're living amongst this Rubble let's build this wall that you don't live in this reproach that you don't live in this crummy condition because that you can be raised up let's do this together and he never he never said me and then he brings it to him he says he says like this and then I told him of the hand of my God where's all the glory going it's all going to God he said I told them of the hand of my God which was good unto me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build Hallelujah that's a result did you hear the quote what Matthew read this morning and when he talked about the one lays in the flesh he wasn't taught right she said the other lady came up she was quiet she sat there and she walked up in the line she was there for that child who had legs that wouldn't move and all of a sudden the child goes look Mommy and she looks at brother remember she says brother random I knew it would happen I knew what would happen what did that humble approach do her husband who was a sinner came burning out of the audience and wanted that God because he'd seen other gods he'd seen other religions he said but when he saw something genuine and he saw it was the love of God that did it he wanted some of that and when they saw the humility of Nehemiah they saw the burden of his heart they they saw the respect that he had for God and how that God had moved and brought him thus far and got a cup Bearer to pack a letter of the king with soldiers something that's totally unperceivable but when they saw it and they saw his attitude and approach they wanted to be a part of it you know maybe more people would want to be a part of what we have if we took The Humble side and then we're here and he said and they said and I he okay I was where was I verse 18. okay okay and they and and then I told them the hand of God and and what the king had done and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work they prepared themselves again this great path to Restoration but when what's his name and what's his name and what's his name the servant and the ammonite and gertram and Arab and heard of it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do ye will ye rebel against the king they wouldn't lend their hand to nothing and here's a bunch of little children of God that are going to build the city walls they're not Builders they're nothing but they've got one thing if God be for you who can be against you what is going to stop the will of God from coming to pass in your life only believe all things are possible they looked at that and they looked at that little group and they said you gonna Build That Wall ah reminds me of another Bible story huh you gonna kill me with that rock when did you send this little puny thing out here to fight me am I a dog that you would mock me I'm going to take you and stick you up on that bush and he said well I'm gonna chop your head off one had God always wins if God before you who can be against you and they mocked him then I answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will rise and build but you have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem I love that amen that's chapter two just a little bit we could glean out of it amen it encourages me that God Can Build me into a statue of a perfect man he can bring me into a visible Union with him and that as he is so can I be in this world not by my might not by my strength but by his spirit saith the Lord so God richly bless you continue reading we'll have a uh we'll
