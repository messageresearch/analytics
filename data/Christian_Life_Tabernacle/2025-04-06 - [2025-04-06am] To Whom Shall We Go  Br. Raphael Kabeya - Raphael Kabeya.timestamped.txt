[12:18] world and
[12:20] in
[12:21] [Music]
[12:24] Jesus. Is that your prayer tonight this
[12:27] morning? Hallelujah.
[12:30] We'll ask brother Dan Dylan to come and
[12:32] open up our service in a word of
[12:39] [Music]
[12:43] prayer. Yes, Lord Jesus. We just want
[12:46] to have that on our heart as we come
[12:48] into your house this morning.
[12:50] That Lord, all we want is you. You're
[12:53] the reason that we've come here this
[12:55] morning. Lord, if we haven't come here
[12:57] for you, then what have we come here
[12:59] for? We want to hear from you this
[13:02] morning, Lord. We want you to feed our
[13:04] souls, feed our hearts, Lord. We want to
[13:06] be able to take what we hear and go and
[13:09] apply it in our lives and and be your
[13:12] witnesses, Lord, your sons and
[13:14] daughters. We ask that you would take
[13:16] control of the service, Lord, every
[13:19] part, Lord. We just ask that you would
[13:22] just be free in the service, Lord, to
[13:24] move in whatever way you'd see fit. Yes.
[13:28] We ask that you would take over the
[13:29] minister's lips, Lord, that he would be
[13:30] able to speak something to us that would
[13:33] speak directly to each need, Lord Jesus.
[13:36] We ask it all and pray in your name, the
[13:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:42] Amen. Hallelujah. I trust we're happy to
[13:45] be in the house of the Lord. We may turn
[13:47] around and shake someone's hand. Let him
[13:49] know you love
[14:04] him. We're going to read in Psalm 26. If
[14:08] you get your Bibles, we'll just read it
[14:10] together from the first to the last.
[14:25] The scripture reads, "Judge me, O Lord,
[14:29] for I have walked in mine integrity. I
[14:32] have trusted also in the Lord.
[14:35] Therefore, I shall not slide. Examine
[14:38] me, O Lord, and prove me. Try my reigns
[14:42] and my heart. For thy loving kindness is
[14:45] before mine eyes, and I have walked in
[14:48] thy truth. I have not sat with vain
[14:52] persons, neither will I go in with
[14:55] dissemblers. I have hated the
[14:57] congregation of evildoers, and will not
[15:00] sit with the wicked. I will wash mine
[15:03] hands in innocency. So will I compass
[15:06] thine altar, O Lord, that I may publish
[15:09] with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell
[15:12] of all thy wondrous works. Lord, I have
[15:15] loved the habitation of thy house, and
[15:18] the place wherein thine honor dwelleth.
[15:21] Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my
[15:24] life with bloody men, and whose hands is
[15:27] mischief, and the right hand is full of
[15:29] bribes. But as for me, I will walk in
[15:32] mine integrity. Redeem me and be
[15:35] merciful unto me. My foot standeth in an
[15:39] even place. In the congregation will I
[15:42] bless the Lord. Amen. You may be seated.
[15:46] Let's sing. Come and dine.
[15:51] [Music]
[16:02] Well, and Jesus had a
[16:04] table where the saints of God, he
[16:09] invites his souls and people come and
[16:13] die. Oh, and with his
[16:17] men and supplies
[16:20] our sweet to Jesus all the time.

[29:16] Hallelujah.
[29:19] Hallelujah.
[29:21] Hallelujah. We have a couple of
[29:23] announcements for the young people that
[29:25] are going to be attending the camp this
[29:27] year.
[29:28] We'd like to have a quick meeting with
[29:30] you in the fellowship hall. Brother
[29:32] Andrew has some important information
[29:34] for you guys that's needed for us to be
[29:37] prepared to go. And right after that,
[29:39] we'll have a meeting with the adult
[29:40] choir and the youth for those that want
[29:42] to be a part of that. That will also
[29:44] follow in the fellowship hall. Please
[29:46] make your way there right after the
[29:48] meeting.
[29:50] And for the couples, the 39 and
[29:54] under, you have an event this Friday,
[29:56] the 11th, I
[29:58] believe. And we want to make sure that
[30:00] everybody is signed up and ready. This
[30:03] is the last
[30:05] warning or I would say the last
[30:09] invitation. We want to see you there.
[30:12] And then we don't want to forget that we
[30:14] have a pavilion dedication on the 13th.
[30:16] So it'll be right after service. We
[30:19] don't have any requests at the moment,
[30:22] but I know we are a needy people. When
[30:24] we come into the house of the Lord,
[30:26] there's always something on our hearts
[30:27] we want the Lord to deal with us with or
[30:29] provide and move on. So, if you have a
[30:31] need on your heart and you want to make
[30:33] it known to him by the uplifting of your
[30:35] hands, please do so and trust that he
[30:38] sees it. We'll ask brother Matthew to
[30:40] come and pray and we'll ask brothers
[30:43] taking the tithes and offerings to come
[30:44] up.
[30:58] Lord Jesus, we just approach you at this
[31:00] portion of the service, Lord, to take up
[31:02] the tithes and the offerings, Lord. We
[31:05] pray a blessing over those, Lord, and a
[31:07] greater revelation of how giving unto
[31:09] you, Lord, we could never outgive you.
[31:11] For Lord, you've done everything for us,
[31:13] Lord.
[31:14] and you just ask a little back, Lord.
[31:17] And many times we lose focus
[31:21] and lose what the priority is, Lord. And
[31:24] it's always you and your word. And Lord,
[31:27] forgive us where we failed you and
[31:29] failed to give and failed to seize the
[31:32] opportunity. But Lord, may we start
[31:34] having an expectation, Lord, to not give
[31:38] to worldly things. Lord, it's so easy to
[31:42] give to the power company and the
[31:44] mortgage company and to give to our jobs
[31:46] and to give to our flesh and to give to
[31:48] this and that,
[31:50] but Lord, may we give to you. May we
[31:53] give you our time, our prayers, our
[31:55] money, our heart, our everything, Lord,
[31:58] because you're worthy of it and so much
[32:01] more. Lord, I just want to remember the
[32:03] Cashes family and Sister Iris and I
[32:06] believe her friend Isabelle, Lord, at
[32:08] the
[32:10] passing of her friends. And
[32:13] Lord, I think of that family, Lord.
[32:15] They've lost a daughter. I don't know
[32:18] them, Lord, but you do. Lord, I know
[32:20] they believe in you. And we're just
[32:22] asking that you would come be their
[32:24] portion, Lord, that you just you comfort
[32:27] them, Father. And dear, in this cloud of
[32:31] confusion and hurt and pain, Lord, may
[32:34] it just bind them closer to you. And may
[32:38] a ray of sunshine just come down, Lord,
[32:40] and bring peace and an
[32:42] overwhelming joy to know, Lord, that
[32:45] there's going to be a day that we'll be
[32:46] reunited. And on this side, Lord,
[32:48] there's pain and there's hurt, but Lord,
[32:51] you hold the beginning and the end,
[32:53] Lord. So, we just lift them up. Pray
[32:54] that you'd comfort them, Lord. We know
[32:57] you'll receive all the glory, all the
[32:59] honor, all the praise, Lord. and we just
[33:02] commit this service to you, Father, and
[33:04] ask, Lord, for the unspoken prayer
[33:06] request, Lord. There's many needs here.
[33:10] We know that you can meet those needs by
[33:12] the preaching of the word. We pray these
[33:14] things in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[33:20] [Music]
[33:26] [Music]
[33:35] Wonderful,
[33:37] merciful
[33:41] savior, precious
[33:44] redeemer and friend.
[33:49] Who would have thought that a
[33:53] man
[33:55] could rescue the souls of
[34:01] men? Oh, you rescue the
[34:06] souls of
[34:09] men. You're the
[34:12] counselor,
[34:14] comforter,
[34:17] keeper, and
[34:19] Spirit we long to
[34:25] embrace. You are hope when our
[34:30] [Music]
[34:33] hearts. Oh, bless the lost the
[34:38] way.
[34:41] Oh, bless the lost the way.
[34:47] Oh, you are the one that we praise. We

[43:03] [Music]
[43:05] Father
[43:06] Once again this morning we ask you to
[43:09] look beyond our
[43:14] faults for we are
[43:19] needy and you spoke such comforting
[43:23] words to us. You said ask anything of
[43:27] the father in my name and I will grant
[43:31] it.
[43:32] Father, our heart's desire this morning
[43:35] is that we could be
[43:40] overcomers. that we could set aside the
[43:44] sin and unbelief that so easily besets
[43:49] us, the
[43:51] failures in our hearts and our lives and
[43:54] that your grace
[43:57] would and forgiveness would come in and
[44:00] touch us and change us, Father,
[44:03] transform us into the sons and daughters
[44:07] of God.
[44:08] We ask you to bless each one this
[44:11] morning that is
[44:12] here. You know each of them personally,
[44:16] Father. You know their beginning and
[44:19] their
[44:20] end. And Lord, we just ask that you'd
[44:23] set each of us on the path that you
[44:25] choose us to go. We ask for your
[44:28] guidance once again this morning. Bless
[44:31] our minister this morning. Father, may
[44:34] the words of life, Father, fill our
[44:37] hearts and our soul with joy. We ask
[44:40] these wonderful things in Jesus precious
[44:43] name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless.
[44:48] You may be seated this
[44:50] morning. Nice to be in the
[44:54] uh house of the Lord uh this morning and
[44:58] fellowship around the word of the Lord.
[45:02] Uh we're going to try to work in the
[45:04] next few weeks to clear up some more
[45:07] parking places. I think we might have
[45:08] ran out of parking places this morning,
[45:10] but uh we'll try to get some more as
[45:15] soon as we possibly can. So Lord bless
[45:18] you on that. We want to remember uh this
[45:21] Friday night is the banquet for couples
[45:25] 39 and under. Now only one of you has to
[45:28] be 39. So, like if you married an old
[45:32] guy, you can still
[45:34] come or or vice versa. But anyway, so if
[45:38] one of you is under 39, you're welcome
[45:41] to the banquet. I I know the biggest
[45:43] challenge for couples under 39 is
[45:46] babysitters. If you'd like to come and
[45:49] the reason you couldn't come is maybe
[45:51] you don't have a babysitter, maybe you
[45:54] could talk to Sister Lesie and she could
[45:57] go out amongst the congregation and make
[45:59] some phone calls and maybe find you a
[46:02] babysitter. So we we want you to feel a
[46:05] part of that and to come.
[46:08] So we don't do any preaching at the
[46:11] banquet. It's just fellowship. It's just
[46:14] for you to um meet one another and and
[46:18] tell a war stories about your children
[46:21] and about life and just have a real
[46:23] wonderful time together. So that's that.
[46:27] them. Now, next
[46:28] Sunday, we're going to have our our
[46:32] pavilion
[46:33] dedication and u so uh it's supposed to
[46:37] be
[46:38] sunny and 83 degrees with a light
[46:43] breeze, 10 mph breeze. So, uh, what
[46:47] we're going to do is we're going to
[46:49] have, uh, uh, right after service, we're
[46:53] just going to start, uh, cooking
[46:55] hamburgers and hot dogs, maybe some
[46:58] chickens, and who knows, and just have
[47:01] us a nice time of fellowship. Uh, we'd
[47:03] be nice if a couple brothers could help
[47:05] us set up next Saturday. We'll have
[47:08] tables in the uh fellowship hall and
[47:11] tables in the pavilion and uh and places
[47:15] to eat and just have a a a wonderful
[47:19] time. And uh so if next Sunday if you
[47:24] want to come to church
[47:26] uh more casually dressed so you can go
[47:30] uh just to the uh uh uh fellowship after
[47:36] that. Feel free. So uh I I I I know I go
[47:41] to like my bank on Fridays and
[47:44] everybody's uh dressed down. They call
[47:46] it dress down Fridays, you know. And uh
[47:51] so uh I don't want to say dress down,
[47:54] but uh if you want to come where you
[47:56] don't have to change and you don't want
[47:58] to spill on your suit or your nice
[48:00] dress, then you could just come uh ready
[48:04] to go to the picnic. And then the
[48:07] evening uh after we have our picnic at
[48:09] 5:00, we're just going to have a
[48:12] singing, you know. So if you have a
[48:13] special, let Brother Billy know. If you
[48:16] want to sing some songs, we'll just come
[48:18] in and have a singing. Uh and I always
[48:21] enjoy that. So it's really a a wonderful
[48:24] time. So uh kind of a I I like themes in
[48:29] my heart. So kind of our theme for our
[48:32] banquet and uh is going to be out of
[48:35] Philippians
[48:37] uh 4 and 4. So if if they put
[48:41] Philippians 4 and 4, we're going to read
[48:43] Philippians 4
[48:46] 4-7. And and so this is what our uh we
[48:51] want next Sunday. We want every day to
[48:53] be like this. But uh so it says in the
[48:59] Philippians 4 and 4 it says rejoice in
[49:04] the Lord always and again I say rejoice.
[49:10] Amen. God it's good to rejoice in the
[49:13] Lord. Let your moderation be known unto
[49:17] all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful
[49:20] for
[49:21] nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[49:26] supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[49:30] request be made known unto God. And the
[49:35] peace of God which patheth all
[49:38] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[49:41] minds through Christ Jesus. Amen. And so
[49:46] next Sunday, let's rejoice again. I say
[49:51] rejoice. Do you love the Lord? Are you
[49:54] glad what he's done for you? Just think
[49:57] all that he's done for you. He can do
[49:59] that and hundfold more. So let's don't
[50:03] let fear enter into our hearts and our
[50:06] lives, but let's have faith. Amen. Faith
[50:10] for the journey. So this morning it's a
[50:12] a real uh before we announced our
[50:15] minister, but tonight's communion
[50:17] service. So uh it's one of the things
[50:20] that the Lord said that he wanted us to
[50:23] do here while we're on earth uh uh to
[50:28] make sure we're there. He um we don't
[50:32] have many requirements, but communion
[50:35] and footwashing is one of them. So, uh,
[50:38] if you haven't taken communion in a
[50:40] while, uh, make a special effort to come
[50:43] tonight. You want to have communion and
[50:46] footwashing in your life. It's a very
[50:49] important part of your fellowship with
[50:52] the Lord. So, tonight's our communion
[50:54] service. Brother Matthew will be
[50:57] bringing us the communion service
[50:58] message, and we'll have communion and
[51:01] footwashing following and then worship.
[51:04] So, we're just looking for a wonderful
[51:06] time this morning. Amen. Now, this
[51:09] morning we have a special guest. Brother
[51:13] Raphael is with us and he's just part of
[51:17] our family. And uh you know, that's what
[51:20] a church really should be. It should be
[51:21] a family. And and I know over the weeks
[51:25] and times that uh we've had uh
[51:29] uh different couples move into our area.
[51:33] And so keep your eye out. If you see
[51:35] somebody new you haven't seen before,
[51:37] reach out to them. Go shake their hand.
[51:40] Ask them how they're doing. Ask them if
[51:42] they're visiting. Uh and just be
[51:44] friendly and and let the love of the
[51:47] Lord sh uh shed abroad in your heart. If
[51:50] you've come and you haven't got a chance
[51:52] to meet me, well, I'm nothing special.
[51:56] just knock on the door, come back, ask
[51:58] one of the deacons, and we can certainly
[52:01] shake your hand and and say hello to you
[52:05] and and uh welcome you in the uh
[52:09] household of faith. Now, again, my my
[52:14] famous brother Raphael, he just I love
[52:17] him. He he comes to visit. He's his
[52:21] daughter lives here. Brother Billy's his
[52:24] son-in-law and uh so Billy's on his best
[52:29] behavior, you know, and and Jadita's
[52:33] mom's with Mr. Cre, where are you
[52:36] at? Would you stand up for us? Amen. So,
[52:40] Jita's
[52:44] mom. Amen. So, uh we're we're happy to
[52:48] have them. Brother Raphael pastors a
[52:50] church in
[52:52] Brazerville. Uh uh so uh that's just
[52:57] south country on the other side of the
[52:59] river from Congo.
[53:02] uh dedicated to the word just uh just
[53:07] right down the middle of the road and
[53:09] serving God's people and and
[53:12] and many outreaches in his country into
[53:16] the countryides and and meeting the
[53:20] needs of the people. every time he
[53:23] comes, I keep trying to get him to
[53:24] preach, and he always lets me know he's
[53:27] here
[53:28] resting. And uh and normally I don't uh
[53:33] I don't uh take that as an excuse, but
[53:37] uh but you know, he always comes and and
[53:40] I'm always fortunate when I get a chance
[53:44] to have him speak for us and he would do
[53:48] that this morning. But one of the things
[53:51] that I've always felt is that a man
[53:55] doesn't only minister with his words. He
[53:58] ministers with his nature and with his
[54:02] spirit. And brother Raphael's spirit
[54:05] nature has always ministered to me. And
[54:10] that just solid even
[54:14] keel confidence in God's word is is a
[54:18] real blessing. and and I really feed off
[54:21] of that and I'm really lifted up by it.
[54:25] And this morning I think that you'll
[54:28] uh really enjoy what he has to
[54:32] say. Uh those of you that speak French,
[54:35] I'm sure he'll speak in French this
[54:37] morning. So you can hear the sermon
[54:39] twice. So uh in French and in English,
[54:43] it should have double effect on you. And
[54:46] and then also you can check to see if
[54:49] brother Billy's interpreting correctly.
[54:52] So
[54:54] uh it it ought to be a real good uh time
[54:58] in the Lord. But I got confidence in
[55:01] Billy. So I'm just going to accept it
[55:03] the way that I hear it. You love the
[55:05] Lord this morning. Let's all stand
[55:07] together this morning
[55:10] and and let's sing Only Believe.
[55:15] All things are possible.
[55:17] Do you believe anything's possible?
[55:20] Nothing's impossible for
[55:22] God. If you're looking at a
[55:26] mountain, if you have a faith of a
[55:29] mustard
[55:31] seed, just a little bit of hope, a
[55:34] little bit of faith that God can do all
[55:37] things. He can move that mountain out of
[55:41] your life. If you've got an
[55:44] obstacle, maybe a tree has fall across
[55:48] your path and your life, if you can
[55:51] muster up just the smallest amount of
[55:54] faith, you can say to that tree, "Be
[55:57] moved and be plucked up and be thrown in
[56:00] the sea and God's path in your life can
[56:03] open up this morning." So if you believe
[56:06] all things are possible, then you
[56:08] believe this morning that he can speak
[56:10] to
[56:12] you. That a man that's dedicated his
[56:15] life to God can come thousands of miles
[56:19] across the Atlantic Ocean to Dallas,
[56:22] Fort Worth, Texas, take this eternal
[56:25] word of
[56:26] God, open it
[56:29] up, and speak straight to you.
[56:34] And you can sit back and say, "He didn't
[56:36] know that." Or, "How did he know that?"
[56:38] There's one that knows you this morning.
[56:41] And he uses men to and his word to speak
[56:46] to your heart. Amen. May he speak to
[56:49] your heart this morning. And may all the
[56:52] condemnation of our lives leave us. May
[56:56] we leave those things which are behind
[56:59] behind. Can't undo yesterday. But let's
[57:03] take the day that we have, turn it
[57:05] towards Christ Jesus, and live more
[57:08] steadfast for him than we ever have.
[57:12] Let's sing Only Believe as our brother
[57:16] comes. Oh,
[57:19] only
[57:23] believe,
[57:25] only believe.
[57:30] All things are
[57:35] possible.
[57:37] Only
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] believe.
[57:43] Only
[57:47] believe.
[57:49] Only
[57:52] believe. All things are
[57:58] possible.
[58:00] Let's sing. Lord, I believe. Tell them
[58:03] you believe this morning. Oh
[58:06] Lord, I Oh, I believe,
[58:12] Lord, I
[58:16] believe. All things are possible.
[58:22] My
[58:24] [Music]
[58:34] brother,
[58:36] Lord, I
[58:40] believe. All things are
[58:46] [Music]
[58:48] possible.
[58:53] Our heavenly father,
[58:58] we come as
[59:00] [Music]
[59:03] believers and we say thank you for the
[59:05] end time
[59:10] message. In in it we can find everything
[59:14] from the new birth till
[59:17] glory. You were so wonderful
[59:22] Lord that you follow us through the mud
[59:25] of
[59:27] sins. You took us from there and you
[59:30] washed us
[59:33] and you took our place.
[59:36] You took our
[59:40] condemnations and then we are more than
[59:43] perfect in you Lord.
[59:45] [Music]
[59:47] This morning we have need of you
[59:52] because we have nothing to give each
[59:54] other.
[59:56] You send this message
[59:59] to nourish us with it.
[1:00:02] Then take us out of the
[1:00:04] way and take control of
[1:00:08] everything. You know the needs of your
[1:00:10] children.
[1:00:14] You promised to never leave us or never
[1:00:16] to abandon us.
[1:00:20] Come and prove that through your word
[1:00:22] today.
[1:00:25] Bless our pastor here, Brother David.
[1:00:29] Bless his family.
[1:00:31] [Music]
[1:00:32] Bless those that work with him.
[1:00:38] those that are working hard to make sure
[1:00:40] that the work the work of God goes
[1:00:45] forward that those that don't know you
[1:00:47] in this city may may see the light and
[1:00:50] follow
[1:00:53] it. Bless them for the personal gift, oh
[1:00:56] God, for this
[1:00:58] cause. Now take us out of the
[1:01:03] way. you that knows everything, that you
[1:01:06] may take control over everything.
[1:01:10] Look to us through the blood that was
[1:01:12] shed at the cross
[1:01:14] and this morning help us
[1:01:17] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:22] You may have your seats for a moment.
[1:01:35] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:01:36] Jesus
[1:01:41] Christ and I send I bring greetings from
[1:01:44] our little church in
[1:01:47] Brazville the end time message
[1:01:53] tabernacle. They asked me to greet you
[1:01:55] all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:56] Christ.
[1:02:04] And I want to just thank the whole
[1:02:06] church for the hospitality that have
[1:02:08] always been uh test testified to us
[1:02:11] that's been always extended to
[1:02:16] us. Uh my wife and I, we feel very uh
[1:02:25] spoiled. Families invited us to their
[1:02:28] homes. So we ate
[1:02:30] and God blessed them
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:02:40] richly and there are those that come to
[1:02:43] uh the house with Billy's house and they
[1:02:46] come with food and we eat together. We
[1:02:48] certainly uh may God bless them for
[1:02:51] that.
[1:02:59] Uh yesterday there was about I believe
[1:03:02] seven families that came and the pastor
[1:03:04] came in too.
[1:03:08] I believe it was about 60 people at the
[1:03:11] house
[1:03:13] and I felt very
[1:03:18] little goodness that's extended.
[1:03:22] All I can say
[1:03:26] in this country where people work
[1:03:34] hard. When I see people spend the little
[1:03:37] that they have to to to as a testimony
[1:03:40] of the love that they have one for
[1:03:44] another that really touches my heart
[1:03:46] very much. All I can
[1:03:50] say that it may God bless you over your
[1:03:54] expectations.
[1:03:58] My wife and I will say thank you to all
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] you. I believe that the most important
[1:04:13] thing that we look for in coming to
[1:04:15] church is to see Jesus.
[1:04:21] When we go to a certain church, when we
[1:04:23] come to
[1:04:27] church, the most important thing is to
[1:04:29] see Jesus in front of
[1:04:35] us. I believe that the entire Bible and
[1:04:38] the whole message of the hour,
[1:04:42] it's only pointing to one thing.
[1:04:48] to present Christ to the people so they
[1:04:51] can see him
[1:04:55] that they may identify to him and become
[1:04:58] one with him
[1:05:02] and we can say it's Christ in us the
[1:05:05] hope of glory
[1:05:10] and I believe when the uncction or the
[1:05:12] anointing of the word comes upon the
[1:05:14] word
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] It opens your eyes for you to see and
[1:05:20] say this is the
[1:05:22] truth and that's the truth.
[1:05:27] And I believe it was my case when I
[1:05:29] received the
[1:05:30] message. I was in a
[1:05:34] denomination where where I thought it
[1:05:36] was the very top
[1:05:43] and when I heard the message for the for
[1:05:45] the first time it was a Thursday in
[1:05:49] 1980 and it was very interesting to
[1:05:53] me. Uh they had they had a series of
[1:05:57] meetings. Uh Friday I came to the
[1:06:00] meetings
[1:06:01] I
[1:06:03] heard Saturday I came to the meeting. I
[1:06:08] heard and I was convinced that that was
[1:06:11] God speaking,
[1:06:14] not the
[1:06:17] pastor, not the people that were coming
[1:06:19] to the to the at the
[1:06:21] altar or not even the
[1:06:26] preachers, but it was the word that was
[1:06:28] being spoken to me that was God.
[1:06:36] And for since then for me I never really
[1:06:39] want to give more honor to the person. I
[1:06:42] respect the man,
[1:06:45] but what means a lot to me is the word.
[1:06:51] And I was convinced the third day on the
[1:06:54] Saturday
[1:06:56] and then and Sunday
[1:06:59] morning as when people were coming to
[1:07:03] church, I came uh right straight to the
[1:07:09] pastors. I said, "I'm not going into the
[1:07:12] sanctuary unless I'm baptized."
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:20] He asked me, he said, "You know, no,
[1:07:23] just go to the sanctuary. We'll we'll
[1:07:25] have a service and then we'll have a
[1:07:26] service of baptism after the meetings."
[1:07:31] I said, "I am not going into the
[1:07:33] sanctuary unless I'm baptized."
[1:07:37] And it was the winter time. It was very
[1:07:40] cold
[1:07:43] and his associate took me to a river.
[1:07:46] They baptized me there.
[1:07:49] And since
[1:07:55] then, there's many ministers when they
[1:07:57] speak, you pay close to the attention to
[1:08:00] what they say.
[1:08:02] As long as it's the message,
[1:08:04] I'm with it.
[1:08:07] But when it's something else
[1:08:11] or to become a a fanatic of a certain
[1:08:14] person,
[1:08:17] that that doesn't attract
[1:08:23] me. I've learned to only be be dependent
[1:08:26] of of God alone.
[1:08:29] I don't know a lot of
[1:08:31] things but the fewer things that I know
[1:08:34] I hold on to
[1:08:36] that then I
[1:08:41] believe that with God we continually
[1:08:44] learn many wonderful
[1:08:46] things because the word doesn't get
[1:08:51] old is continually opening our
[1:08:57] eyes and is making us dependent on God
[1:09:01] alone as
[1:09:06] individuals. No, nobody needs to be
[1:09:09] attached to a certain group.
[1:09:14] Nobody needs to align himself to a
[1:09:16] certain
[1:09:17] leader. When the message touches the
[1:09:20] heart,
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:26] You recognize the word of God that
[1:09:28] touches your heart as an individual
[1:09:32] and that will stay with you until the
[1:09:38] end. And then the great vision that we
[1:09:41] should have
[1:09:43] is Jesus Christ in everything
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:49] is the only necessary
[1:09:55] thing. And Christ doesn't let anyone see
[1:09:59] him or recognize
[1:10:01] him outside of his bride.
[1:10:06] It's only the bride that would recognize
[1:10:09] Christ.
[1:10:14] The church can appreciate the message.
[1:10:16] They can clap their hands as we see
[1:10:21] today. They can worship Christ with a
[1:10:24] lot of noise.
[1:10:27] It can know everything about his death
[1:10:32] and they can tell a lot of stories about
[1:10:34] his miracles and a lot of
[1:10:37] things. But to see him in his word,
[1:10:44] that is only reserved to the
[1:10:46] predestinated
[1:10:51] [Music]
[1:10:54] seed. Do you know why the unbeliever has
[1:10:58] trouble believing this message of the
[1:11:00] end time pre message?
[1:11:04] It's because everything has become
[1:11:06] formal.
[1:11:11] the the the way that the believers and
[1:11:13] the ministers,
[1:11:18] the way that they live the word of God
[1:11:20] or they leave the word is so
[1:11:22] superficial.
[1:11:27] people are following their own personal
[1:11:30] interest.
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:34] And they they they they live in the
[1:11:36] state of uh um
[1:11:39] u selfishness.
[1:11:44] But the Christianity as the prophet will
[1:11:46] say it,
[1:11:49] it's a living being in the human being.
[1:11:55] Christianity is not just a
[1:11:58] religion. It's a living being in a human
[1:12:02] being.
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:08] Christ the the the Christ the living
[1:12:11] person living in human men and women and
[1:12:15] with the love the agape love
[1:12:21] manifesting they express eternal life
[1:12:23] which is living for
[1:12:27] others and I believe the dynamic is
[1:12:29] always is already on the road.
[1:12:37] as the message is being preached in many
[1:12:40] churches so they could shape sons and
[1:12:42] daughters of God.
[1:12:49] There's nothing else outside of this
[1:12:51] message that will uh uh shape us and
[1:12:54] make us becoming the likeness of
[1:12:56] God. And now if you
[1:12:59] can, let's stand.
[1:13:03] And let's read our Bible, our scripture.
[1:13:08] We're going to open our book, our Bibles
[1:13:10] in uh John chapter
[1:13:15] 6 and we'll start from verse uh 66.
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:31] From that time many of the his disciple
[1:13:34] went back and walked no more with him.
[1:13:42] Then Jesus said unto the 12, "Will he
[1:13:46] also go away?"
[1:13:55] Then Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to
[1:13:58] whom shall we go? Thou has the words of
[1:14:01] eternal
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:07] life and we believe and are sure that
[1:14:11] thou are the Christ, the son of the
[1:14:13] living
[1:14:14] God. Our heavenly father bless your word
[1:14:19] and give us the context
[1:14:21] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:25] You may have your seats.
[1:14:29] Once again, we want to thank brother
[1:14:30] David
[1:14:32] for the opportunity
[1:14:36] this morning by the grace of
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:44] God. I want to speak on a certain
[1:14:47] subject that the that the theme that the
[1:14:49] prophet spoke in the message to whom
[1:14:51] shall we go?
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:57] I want to speak on one of the reasons
[1:14:59] why we should go to
[1:15:03] Jesus is because is the eternal re uh
[1:15:08] reality
[1:15:16] realizes
[1:15:17] today but everything will pass away.
[1:15:22] There's an eternal reality.
[1:15:25] It's Jesus Christ.
[1:15:27] I will speak on that for a little bit.
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:48] We are so many times sitting almost at
[1:15:50] the border watching two realities and
[1:15:54] things happening at the great scene of
[1:15:56] two different things
[1:16:00] happening. One of the scenes that we are
[1:16:03] watching is the end of the history.
[1:16:08] And the other is the end of time and the
[1:16:11] fusion into the eternal
[1:16:16] realm.
[1:16:19] And it's important that we know on what
[1:16:22] we are standing in regards to what's
[1:16:24] happening in the world
[1:16:27] today. And as believers of this message,
[1:16:30] the end time message
[1:16:33] and we know that Christ is at the door.
[1:16:37] that at any moment will be taken up to
[1:16:44] glory. We have to live uh uh in uh based
[1:16:48] on what we expecting to be in
[1:16:52] expectation. There's a lot of realities
[1:16:55] that we
[1:16:57] see to today churches that are
[1:17:00] established
[1:17:03] the true servants of God
[1:17:10] And many times they they they they bring
[1:17:13] a lot of confusion and bringing uh
[1:17:15] darkness upon the people.
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:24] Today we find people sometimes that love
[1:17:27] God, that want to walk with God.
[1:17:28] Sometimes they don't know which way to
[1:17:30] go. Glory to you. But glory to God.
[1:17:36] God has given a portion of his word.
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:41] There was a portion an appropriate or a
[1:17:44] a specific portion
[1:17:48] that has to that had to be manifested in
[1:17:51] each
[1:17:54] season and it's the only light for the
[1:17:57] time that we are living in.
[1:18:01] We know that the word of God comes to
[1:18:03] the prophet.
[1:18:06] The prophet reveals it to the people
[1:18:10] and the people will believe it.
[1:18:14] And then at that time it's God himself
[1:18:16] in
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:21] action acting by his own spirit and
[1:18:24] revealing himself to the elect.
[1:18:29] This message will reveal the elected
[1:18:31] ones
[1:18:35] because the predestinated one will only
[1:18:37] stay with a
[1:18:42] message. Matthew 24:24 was said the
[1:18:45] elect will not be deceived. It's a
[1:18:47] prophecy for the time that we are living
[1:18:52] in. message is revealing the true
[1:19:00] elect. The eagllet, the sons and
[1:19:02] daughters of God, they are manifested by
[1:19:05] the message of the hour.
[1:19:08] The prophet
[1:19:10] says in the message why uh the why
[1:19:13] little Bethlehem
[1:19:16] paragraph
[1:19:17] 127 the prophet says
[1:19:22] I don't worship a
[1:19:26] Jew I worship God when I worship Jesus
[1:19:34] Christ I don't worship some fiction or
[1:19:37] some kind of a
[1:19:39] history something.
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:49] I worship Jesus Christ, the presence of
[1:19:52] Jesus Christ right now, which is his
[1:19:55] word that's manifested in this age.
[1:19:58] And Jesus
[1:20:02] Christ that's been manifested in this
[1:20:08] age. The Bible and the message only
[1:20:11] talks about one thing and that is Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ.
[1:20:15] And to preach Jesus Christ
[1:20:20] is to to say what the message said
[1:20:22] concerning the age that we are living
[1:20:25] in. In paragraph 128,
[1:20:29] [Music]
[1:20:31] God in every age allotted his
[1:20:39] word from the beginning and every time
[1:20:43] uh which one of these age passed by,
[1:20:49] God sends down an anointed prophet for
[1:20:52] that age.
[1:20:55] Regardless of what people say in social
[1:21:00] media and there are those that leave the
[1:21:03] message and they kind of go talk about
[1:21:05] all kinds of
[1:21:08] stuff and with all the supernatural that
[1:21:11] follow this
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:14] message. There's no way you can take a
[1:21:17] or you can lie to a true
[1:21:22] believer. Not the money, not the
[1:21:25] popularity will seduce a true believer
[1:21:29] in the days of
[1:21:32] Noah, days of the rest of them
[1:21:36] when he made the
[1:21:41] promises. I don't care what kind of
[1:21:44] condition the church got
[1:21:47] into. He always does
[1:21:50] that. He sends a man anointed
[1:21:56] for the word of God for for the word of
[1:22:00] the Lord comes to the prophet
[1:22:04] and he stood there and he stood
[1:22:09] there. Each prophet was condemned by the
[1:22:12] organization of that of that
[1:22:18] day. But but he stood on that word on
[1:22:22] the word and made the word live.
[1:22:27] We see today
[1:22:31] uh with the coming of social
[1:22:35] media and everything is degraded and
[1:22:39] corrupt at the speed that you cannot
[1:22:41] understand.
[1:22:44] On on what man,
[1:22:47] on what president of the country,
[1:22:51] on what
[1:22:54] science, on what man of God will men
[1:22:57] stand
[1:22:59] upon, in what on on whom will men stand
[1:23:06] on? There's nothing outside of Jesus
[1:23:10] Christ. And Jesus Christ is the message
[1:23:13] of the hour.
[1:23:17] Jesus is everything to the elect.
[1:23:20] Why?
[1:23:22] Because Jesus
[1:23:26] alone. He possess all that that
[1:23:30] everything that he has and no man no
[1:23:31] other man
[1:23:35] has. He possess things that no man on
[1:23:38] earth possess.
[1:23:44] And there are many reasons why people
[1:23:46] should go to Jesus Christ.
[1:23:50] We're going to consider one of those
[1:23:53] reasons is going to give us like a point
[1:23:56] a place where we can
[1:24:01] start a a reason that will give us
[1:24:03] enthusiasm if we understand what we're
[1:24:06] talking about.
[1:24:10] something that will encourage us and it
[1:24:12] will give us a good a good hold
[1:24:16] a good positioning in the
[1:24:19] message. The main
[1:24:24] reason is Jesus Christ is the only real
[1:24:27] a perfect real
[1:24:32] realization is the only durable
[1:24:34] realization
[1:24:37] is the only eternal
[1:24:41] realization. I'm going to let the
[1:24:43] prophet speak for a little bit
[1:24:47] in the message to whom shall we go.
[1:24:51] I preach on uh uh uh July 4th uh uh June
[1:24:56] 4th, 1960.
[1:24:59] Uh if you you can listen to the
[1:25:01] authorized
[1:25:05] voice it says. Now one thing I want to
[1:25:09] say the six the sixth thing
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:16] the sixth thing he is the only lasting
[1:25:23] achievement Jesus is the only lasting
[1:25:29] achievement. Tell me anything that you
[1:25:32] got that you could get that may that
[1:25:34] could
[1:25:37] you could achieve that would be eternal
[1:25:41] outside of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:48] There's nothing that we can achieve in
[1:25:50] this world that could be
[1:25:54] eternal. Any everything is is is going
[1:25:57] to pass by. Everything will perish.
[1:26:01] Build a fine house.
[1:26:04] a a fine house.
[1:26:07] We have a lot of good uh fine
[1:26:09] house. But when a tsunami comes, when
[1:26:12] fire comes, everything is gone.
[1:26:16] And we we are stay we stay behind
[1:26:19] coin, we can build a fine
[1:26:21] house, get a million
[1:26:26] dollars, be the most popular woman in
[1:26:29] the
[1:26:30] country. We can call
[1:26:35] everything. We we work hard and we run
[1:26:38] after money.
[1:26:41] All things will pass away if Christ
[1:26:43] doesn't have his place in your
[1:26:47] life. Be the uh the most popular woman
[1:26:50] in the
[1:26:51] country, strongest
[1:26:54] man that ever walked on the
[1:26:59] streets. be the world record uh prize
[1:27:03] fighter. Whatever you want to
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:09] be. See, see if you don't wink and
[1:27:13] twinkle and
[1:27:16] die to be the most famous preacher in
[1:27:19] the
[1:27:21] world followed by many people with
[1:27:25] acclamations. We saw those things. It
[1:27:28] passed by. We don't even talk about them
[1:27:33] anymore. The to be a preacher just the
[1:27:36] moment you come through the door to
[1:27:37] come and
[1:27:40] everybody people coming all
[1:27:43] across all of those
[1:27:45] things will pass because there's only
[1:27:48] one eternal thing and that's Jesus
[1:27:51] Christ and Jesus Christ.
[1:27:55] How look how he was like a a feeble
[1:27:59] where he was the strongest of
[1:28:01] all. He looked like a
[1:28:04] poor but all the gold and silver
[1:28:07] belonged to
[1:28:09] him. He looked like a a a person with no
[1:28:12] value but he was the most powerful. But
[1:28:17] year when God lifts you up a little bit,
[1:28:20] I want everybody to look at us.
[1:28:24] Those things the elect will not be
[1:28:26] attracted to those.
[1:28:28] The prophet
[1:28:29] says uh whatever you want to
[1:28:34] be look if you don't twinkle h dwindle
[1:28:38] and twinkle and
[1:28:41] die. That's
[1:28:44] right. It won't take but few sons to do
[1:28:48] it.
[1:28:52] So the only eternal achievement there is
[1:28:55] is Jesus Christ.
[1:28:58] Now listen to the prophet.
[1:29:03] He is the most and best that we can
[1:29:06] achieve
[1:29:13] for let's make that our achievement.
[1:29:17] Then let's be sure that we get him.
[1:29:23] We come to church like I said it in the
[1:29:25] beginning. It's to see
[1:29:28] Jesus, to accept
[1:29:30] him, to identif identify with him, and
[1:29:34] to be one with him.
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:38] It's him that has things that he can
[1:29:41] give to you and nobody
[1:29:45] else. And be sure to receive him when
[1:29:48] you come here.
[1:29:51] Let's be sure that we have him.
[1:29:54] You could be a preacher.
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] You could be you might be a
[1:30:00] pastor. There are titles.
[1:30:03] It's a function. It goes away.
[1:30:07] You might be a
[1:30:10] deacon. You might be a church
[1:30:14] member. But if you haven't you you
[1:30:18] haven't in your achievement,
[1:30:20] it's not sufficient to just be
[1:30:23] [Music]
[1:30:24] that it's to go and go all the way until
[1:30:28] you get Christ. The messenger
[1:30:34] says you might you might achieve and say
[1:30:41] I won't stop till I become a preacher.
[1:30:46] The pastor knows me
[1:30:47] already. I continue to do certain
[1:30:51] things. Until I get his
[1:30:54] attention, I'm not going
[1:30:56] to until I become a preacher,
[1:30:59] too. They are
[1:31:04] ambitions. I won't stop till I till I
[1:31:07] become a deacon.
[1:31:10] I know that deacons have power.
[1:31:13] They can come together.
[1:31:15] and take make
[1:31:16] decision. I have to come and go to their
[1:31:18] group.
[1:31:21] I won't stop till I become a church
[1:31:24] member. But
[1:31:27] says, "Done things are right and
[1:31:32] honorable. But listen here, brother.
[1:31:37] Don't stop short of Jesus
[1:31:42] Christ or you haven't gotten an eternal
[1:31:45] achievement
[1:31:48] because your pastor and
[1:31:52] [Music]
[1:31:54] all your work as a pastor will soon fade
[1:32:01] away. Your work as a deacon will soon go
[1:32:06] when you sleep.
[1:32:10] You know they'll speak about you.
[1:32:13] He was a good
[1:32:16] brother. He was visible and then after a
[1:32:19] moment forgotten.
[1:32:22] Is that true?
[1:32:24] Listen
[1:32:26] then your work uh your your work as a
[1:32:29] deacon will soon go.
[1:32:34] Your church membership will be long
[1:32:39] dismissed will will long be dismissed
[1:32:42] from minds of the people just in a
[1:32:45] little while to
[1:32:48] come. But if you've you've achieved
[1:32:50] Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ, then you've got eternal
[1:32:56] life and you can never die.
[1:33:00] [Music]
[1:33:01] That's why we come here.
[1:33:06] So we can achieve this perfect
[1:33:08] realization.
[1:33:13] And to be led and to be anchored into
[1:33:16] this realization.
[1:33:18] Look,
[1:33:22] we have a lot of uh uharmacies in this
[1:33:25] uh town uh uh town
[1:33:29] uh to help uh natural health.
[1:33:37] Go tell me which pharmacy you can go and
[1:33:40] get a a medicine that will give you an
[1:33:43] eternal
[1:33:44] health. There is none.
[1:33:50] We there there's a lot of commentary and
[1:33:52] a lot of publicities on the medicine.
[1:33:54] It's a lie so you can buy it.
[1:34:03] There's no medicine that will change you
[1:34:05] from an old man to a young
[1:34:09] [Music]
[1:34:11] person. take away the wrinkles and
[1:34:14] everything, but could to the contrary,
[1:34:16] it multiplies it.
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:22] There's no medicine that will make you
[1:34:24] holy in your
[1:34:28] conduct. There's none that can give you
[1:34:30] joy and peace.
[1:34:34] And remember my Christian friends,
[1:34:41] you've come many times to the altar.
[1:34:46] Many times you come in in
[1:34:52] tears and in many times you've renew
[1:34:55] your engagements with
[1:34:57] Christ. At the end of the
[1:35:00] preaching, your heart is touched.
[1:35:03] You are in tears. Then you come to the
[1:35:06] altar, oh Lord. Oh
[1:35:09] Lord, I renew my
[1:35:11] engagement. We we've done that many
[1:35:17] times. And you find a way to to to take
[1:35:20] away the
[1:35:23] guilt. And I invite you uh uh truly this
[1:35:28] morning to to free yourself completely.
[1:35:34] to know that Jesus took your
[1:35:41] place. He took your iniquity upon him,
[1:35:44] not asking anything from
[1:35:47] [Music]
[1:35:48] you. You just need to accept what he did
[1:35:52] for
[1:35:53] you when the children of Israel
[1:35:58] when they were bitten by the venomous
[1:36:00] snake in the wilderness.
[1:36:02] God told
[1:36:04] Moses and says, "Just take the the the
[1:36:07] serpent and lift him up,
[1:36:11] and whichsoever was bitten by the
[1:36:14] snakeortal." Now remember, every bite of
[1:36:17] the serpent was
[1:36:19] mortal. But whoever was bitten by the
[1:36:22] serpent as long as they looked at the
[1:36:25] serpent on the cross, they they kept
[1:36:28] life in them.
[1:36:31] It it wasn't about
[1:36:33] reasoning. Just look and and just
[1:36:37] look. That's what God
[1:36:39] said. When God speaks, he knows what
[1:36:43] he's talking about.
[1:36:44] Just
[1:36:45] look and you will have life.
[1:36:49] And those that were doing that, they
[1:36:52] were receiving
[1:36:53] life. Those that were reasoning and
[1:36:55] doubting, they were dying.
[1:36:59] It was only a type.
[1:37:03] John 3:16 said, "God so loved the world.
[1:37:08] If you believe God loves
[1:37:10] you, God so loved the
[1:37:13] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:37:16] son for those that will believe him
[1:37:20] just to
[1:37:22] believe just to believe that he died for
[1:37:27] you. Just believe that he took your sin
[1:37:29] upon you. You are no longer a sinner. He
[1:37:33] took your
[1:37:36] place. He just ask you one thing and
[1:37:38] that is to believe in what he said. To
[1:37:41] believe the sacrifice of the cross so
[1:37:44] you can have
[1:37:46] life. To believe the blood that was
[1:37:49] shed, the blood that was the life that
[1:37:51] was given which is the life of God comes
[1:37:54] upon
[1:37:55] you and you become a changed person.
[1:38:01] It's not complicated.
[1:38:04] It's not It doesn't require explanation.
[1:38:07] Just believe the word.
[1:38:10] Then my friends, my my my my friends
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:25] listen. directly with this entire
[1:38:31] message, you are changed instantly and
[1:38:35] you'll find joy.
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:38] The most important thing in the
[1:38:46] church, it's not to look to the left, to
[1:38:48] the right, or the one who's speaking
[1:38:50] with what accents they speaking in.
[1:38:53] But the most important thing
[1:38:56] is to listen to what's being
[1:38:59] preached. Even if you didn't have
[1:39:02] faith, as you are listening with
[1:39:05] attention, what you are listening to
[1:39:09] will create the faith in
[1:39:13] you. Faith comes from what we are
[1:39:16] hearing and what we are hearing from the
[1:39:18] word of
[1:39:20] God. Don't be distracted in your
[1:39:23] thinking.
[1:39:25] So just pay attention and listen what
[1:39:28] God in his grace will produce the faith
[1:39:32] in you.
[1:39:37] Jesus Christ the rock of Asia
[1:39:42] said the one who will eat my flesh and
[1:39:44] drink my blood will have life in
[1:39:47] him and I will raise him up in the last
[1:39:51] day. And he also said
[1:39:55] that if this earthly temple be
[1:39:58] destroyed, we have another waiting.
[1:40:01] [Music]
[1:40:02] He proved
[1:40:04] that when he died, he came back to
[1:40:08] life and he promised
[1:40:12] rapture to change a change of
[1:40:18] house in in the body. We will
[1:40:21] continually be young.
[1:40:24] And I believe with all my heart
[1:40:27] that Jesus Christ
[1:40:30] this message of the hour,
[1:40:36] it's the only perfect realization and
[1:40:39] achievement that's perfect.
[1:40:43] Jesus Christ is the only one that has
[1:40:46] eternal
[1:40:47] life.
[1:40:49] He's the only one that can give the joy
[1:40:53] that we can ever explain.
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:58] But you have to go all the way to him in
[1:41:00] order to understand that.
[1:41:05] Otherwise, you're going to uh uh uh just
[1:41:07] have a headache with all kinds of
[1:41:09] imaginations.
[1:41:12] you have to go all the way to him to
[1:41:15] understand what's being talked about.
[1:41:17] You
[1:41:19] know, uh the the Jews of that time, they
[1:41:22] said of him
[1:41:25] that this man was be
[1:41:28] elabub and his
[1:41:33] dad. They never went all the way to him.
[1:41:42] They never really followed him as the
[1:41:44] way to follow.
[1:41:51] It's like a man giving his opinion upon
[1:41:53] an apple that they never
[1:41:57] eaten. You have to bite the apple so you
[1:42:01] can give your opinion.
[1:42:04] It's to you have to get to Jesus to meet
[1:42:07] him.
[1:42:09] So you know who he is.
[1:42:13] There's only one God and that's the Lord
[1:42:15] Jesus Christ.
[1:42:19] It's the only eternal achievement and
[1:42:22] perfect achievement.
[1:42:24] He's the first and the
[1:42:26] last. He's the alpha and
[1:42:30] omega and everything that we have need
[1:42:32] of is in him.
[1:42:37] Why did they not understand him?
[1:42:41] Because of his humility.
[1:42:44] Jesus was a a humble man.
[1:42:48] A a man that was not even of any
[1:42:50] knowledge.
[1:42:52] God himself manifested in human being.
[1:42:56] But look at today.
[1:43:00] It's just a little function in the
[1:43:04] church. Uh people have to know that you
[1:43:06] are there.
[1:43:10] Everybody has to stand up when you when
[1:43:12] you coming by is everybody has to honor
[1:43:16] you. Those things are not
[1:43:19] helpful. They they they they move away
[1:43:23] those that are needing God.
[1:43:27] Man wants to see God in another man for
[1:43:30] them to believe him.
[1:43:32] Jesus is the model.
[1:43:34] The prophet was also one of the models.
[1:43:39] See, if there was to be a popular man
[1:43:41] upon this earth, it was going to be
[1:43:43] William Brham,
[1:43:45] but who talks about
[1:43:48] him? The the in the the book of
[1:43:52] Encyclopedia, there's no mention of him.
[1:43:56] They speaks they speak about all the
[1:43:58] other men of God but not yet.
[1:44:01] God was manifested in that man.
[1:44:05] But he was so uh moved
[1:44:09] away but in front of him you look like
[1:44:12] you were the
[1:44:15] greatest. But yet people with just a
[1:44:17] little bit of money they want to see
[1:44:19] people
[1:44:20] want to see them as following them.
[1:44:25] says in the message to whom shall we
[1:44:30] go the first of all he's the
[1:44:35] way and secondly he's the
[1:44:39] truth we can we can speak the
[1:44:43] truth but we are all men subject to
[1:44:47] errors but Jesus was the truth
[1:44:51] it's the truth uh uh within a human
[1:44:55] being. And and thirdly is the light. And
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:01] fourthly is the only eternal foundation.
[1:45:06] And fifth
[1:45:10] is the only eternal
[1:45:15] joy. Eternal joy.
[1:45:20] Okay. Six.
[1:45:22] [Music]
[1:45:25] is the only lasting
[1:45:27] achievement. He is.
[1:45:30] The prophet
[1:45:33] says, "Show me a place,
[1:45:38] a place where you can go
[1:45:42] or something that you can
[1:45:44] do or something that you can
[1:45:48] achieve that will last that would last
[1:45:52] forever outside of Jesus Christ.
[1:46:02] All the men, the great leaders,
[1:46:04] political leaders that great that had
[1:46:06] great realization, we talk about them,
[1:46:08] but they all passed
[1:46:10] away, all the religious
[1:46:14] leaders, even in our
[1:46:17] generation that they had a they had a
[1:46:20] lot of uh
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:22] places. They even talked about how they
[1:46:25] won't die. They will be in the rapture.
[1:46:28] They passed
[1:46:31] away. That's why we should uh set
[1:46:34] ourselves on the only eternal
[1:46:37] achievement and that's the only thing
[1:46:39] that will
[1:46:43] last. Don't follow a man because signs
[1:46:46] and wonders are following him.
[1:46:49] That's not the most important thing.
[1:46:52] The most important thing
[1:46:55] is to stay with the
[1:47:01] message the the wish uh uh uh they they
[1:47:05] they do signs and wonders,
[1:47:08] but God, he's the word.
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:15] Tell me if you can build a house that's
[1:47:18] lasting forever.
[1:47:20] Tell me
[1:47:25] if you can build a popularity that's
[1:47:27] eternal.
[1:47:30] It doesn't exist.
[1:47:36] The your your the world will be carried
[1:47:38] out when you your your your your name is
[1:47:40] pronounced.
[1:47:43] Some will even go and
[1:47:46] say, "Oh, without him, we won't
[1:47:49] understand the message."
[1:47:52] The message you understanded by the Holy
[1:47:54] Spirit, not by a man. We are we are
[1:47:58] preaching. But it's the Holy
[1:48:01] Spirit. He will distribute the word to
[1:48:04] the people.
[1:48:06] I cannot make you understand the
[1:48:08] message. It's the Holy Spirit that does
[1:48:11] that.
[1:48:13] Tell
[1:48:16] me to if you can have any eternal
[1:48:21] popularity. When I'm speaking, I want
[1:48:24] you to to think to think about the
[1:48:26] world. You will see these
[1:48:28] things. There were people that were very
[1:48:32] popular. Oh, when they talk about him,
[1:48:34] everybody says
[1:48:38] that and some will even fight for him.
[1:48:41] and don't talk about him.
[1:48:44] But those things are carnal.
[1:48:50] There's only one person that's eternal
[1:48:52] and that's Jesus Christ.
[1:48:55] Tell
[1:48:58] me if you can acquire riches,
[1:49:03] so many riches that they become
[1:49:06] eternal. Look,
[1:49:11] Sometimes we're not even happy with his
[1:49:13] own riches.
[1:49:19] We cannot be happy as long as we live
[1:49:22] for ourselves,
[1:49:25] a lot of
[1:49:26] money, to have a lot of money.
[1:49:31] And to say that I have a a million
[1:49:35] dollars. Oh, I will I will celebrate my
[1:49:38] fifth million in a couple of months. It
[1:49:41] will not make you
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:44] happy. There's more joy in giving than
[1:49:47] to
[1:49:48] receive. It's when you give that's when
[1:49:52] you feel
[1:49:53] happy. When we get for
[1:49:57] ourselves, it's only the the the
[1:49:59] selfishness
[1:50:01] and it will never bring you anything.
[1:50:06] You cannot do
[1:50:08] that. Nothing outside of Jesus
[1:50:12] Christ is the only lasting
[1:50:14] [Music]
[1:50:18] achievement. And if you have had a lot
[1:50:20] of achievements in your
[1:50:26] life, you have never achieved anything
[1:50:29] eternal unless you achieve Jesus Christ.
[1:50:35] and you have not received him in your
[1:50:37] heart.
[1:50:39] And this
[1:50:40] morning, may God help us
[1:50:45] to get to this eternal achievement
[1:50:48] and to have that in our hearts.
[1:50:51] It's that's the achievement that
[1:50:53] transform
[1:50:54] us into true sons and daughters of God.
[1:50:59] It's that realization in us.
[1:51:04] It will take away the old habits that
[1:51:06] we've carried away from the
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:11] world. The world trained us into drugs.
[1:51:15] Drugs and young
[1:51:17] people. Be careful with with with bad
[1:51:20] company.
[1:51:21] Little by
[1:51:23] little you will get into
[1:51:26] drugs. I've seen that in Washington. I
[1:51:29] was in August, last
[1:51:32] August. Uh the young men in in
[1:51:36] drugs and they they have hair that are
[1:51:38] just all messed
[1:51:40] up. They can't even control their
[1:51:43] own with paints that are falling down.
[1:51:51] It's the company that you hang around
[1:51:52] that brings you in those
[1:51:54] things. But when you listen to this
[1:51:57] message,
[1:51:59] this message that is God himself
[1:52:03] manifests and when you listen
[1:52:04] attentively to the
[1:52:07] message, that message will remove that
[1:52:09] thirst in
[1:52:12] you and make you a modest.
[1:52:16] It will make you a a one that's worthy
[1:52:19] of
[1:52:20] trust because in your
[1:52:22] attitude, in your presentation,
[1:52:26] nobody can give can can can uh uh have
[1:52:29] trust in
[1:52:30] you. If they call an Uber to take
[1:52:35] you and somebody comes with their hair
[1:52:38] all messed up, I'll say, "Oh, excuse me.
[1:52:42] Uh, how much is the trip? I'll pay you
[1:52:45] the trip. I'll let you go by yourself
[1:52:48] because your presentation
[1:52:50] is carrying me.
[1:52:57] Only Jesus,
[1:52:59] this message will change you. Only
[1:53:03] Jesus. This message, not a
[1:53:06] man. That's why listen closely. Listen
[1:53:10] closely and you will
[1:53:12] understand. It's God speaking to you.
[1:53:16] because we are
[1:53:17] here. So we can repeat what God has
[1:53:20] already said.
[1:53:24] The only lasting
[1:53:25] achievement he says I was dead and
[1:53:31] now I am alive for century and
[1:53:36] century. I have the key of death and of
[1:53:39] hell. We have nothing to fear.
[1:53:43] He has everything in his hands.
[1:53:46] My friends,
[1:53:51] Jesus is the true bread that's come down
[1:53:54] from
[1:53:57] heaven. The manner in the wilderness was
[1:54:00] only a type.
[1:54:04] And whosoever eat of this bread that
[1:54:06] came down from
[1:54:08] [Music]
[1:54:09] heaven will never be hungry like the
[1:54:12] children of Israel in the world.
[1:54:16] They they never they never needed to
[1:54:18] come back and eat.
[1:54:20] When the message touches your
[1:54:24] heart from
[1:54:28] transformation into transformation,
[1:54:31] it's not a one time
[1:54:34] It comes progressively.
[1:54:36] It's like that black woman.
[1:54:40] I'm not what I used to be.
[1:54:43] I'm not what I want to be.
[1:54:46] I'm in the transformation.
[1:54:49] I am on the road. And we are on the
[1:54:52] road. Mercy friend. Thank you, Father.
[1:54:57] Then at the moment that you have
[1:54:59] believed him, you have eternal life.
[1:55:03] And that's the
[1:55:05] reality. We we don't need a
[1:55:09] shadow. We don't need a partial
[1:55:12] salvation. We have a complete
[1:55:15] salvation because
[1:55:18] Jesus is not a part of
[1:55:22] God. It is God himself made
[1:55:26] manifest. Jesus is not a sent from God,
[1:55:30] but it's God himself.
[1:55:32] It's the eternal Jehovah,
[1:55:35] the word meant
[1:55:36] flesh. That's the Jesus that we are
[1:55:39] worshiping.
[1:55:44] With this eternal
[1:55:46] realization, authentic uh genuine,
[1:55:50] authentic,
[1:55:53] you will never
[1:55:56] fail. Regardless of what comes on your
[1:56:00] way, you'll have a lot of
[1:56:03] trials, but have confidence in the
[1:56:06] eternal
[1:56:07] realization. You will never fail.
[1:56:11] It's telling
[1:56:12] you I know your
[1:56:15] tribulation. I know your suffering.
[1:56:21] Just be conscious that he knows about it
[1:56:23] and he has everything under control.
[1:56:27] And then my brother and my sister,
[1:56:30] we cannot be lied to
[1:56:35] to to walk behind celebrities that are
[1:56:38] passing by.
[1:56:41] The men of
[1:56:42] God. I I say it with a lot of
[1:56:46] pain. Many men of God,
[1:56:50] the pastor, apostles and
[1:56:53] others are trying to impress
[1:56:58] They make themselves popular so they can
[1:57:00] attract
[1:57:03] people. Adam never preached so he can
[1:57:06] attract people to his church.
[1:57:09] What he always looked
[1:57:13] for people to him that he was connected
[1:57:16] to.
[1:57:19] My my my dear friend uh brothers and
[1:57:22] sisters there's nothing
[1:57:26] There's nobody in the world
[1:57:30] that could produce what Jesus produced
[1:57:34] then the elect
[1:57:39] that get into contact directly with this
[1:57:42] that divine message.
[1:57:45] They coming they they standing face to
[1:57:47] face with the son of manifest.
[1:57:51] They are feeding upon the son of man.
[1:57:54] the word manifested.
[1:57:57] Uh one time in Miami,
[1:58:02] Banana was supposed to preach on a
[1:58:07] campaign, a a
[1:58:12] businessman. He had fallen from a horse
[1:58:15] a couple of years before
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:19] and he had his end twisted and broken up
[1:58:22] and and his hand and
[1:58:26] arm. And when he heard the prophet was
[1:58:28] in Miami for a
[1:58:34] campaign, he didn't go because he
[1:58:36] believed, but he went to
[1:58:41] criticize. But as as as soon as the
[1:58:44] message was being
[1:58:49] preached, he be he started to become
[1:58:52] more and more attentive to what was
[1:58:54] being
[1:58:56] preached. He understood that this was
[1:58:59] not some kind of
[1:59:02] gimmicks, that it was something
[1:59:05] real. And the more he listened with
[1:59:10] attention and the more he began to have
[1:59:13] faith. And his faith was so much
[1:59:18] grown that that touched the prophet
[1:59:20] wherever he was. And he turned and
[1:59:25] you with a white shirt sitting over
[1:59:29] there forth in the set such and such
[1:59:32] robe. God has healed you. And when he
[1:59:36] said that, the man stood up and his arm
[1:59:40] was
[1:59:43] right. And when his wife that was there
[1:59:45] with all the kind of
[1:59:48] makeups, when he saw his husband
[1:59:52] healed, she jumped and she
[1:59:55] fell. What produced that?
[1:59:59] Attentiveness to the word.
[2:00:04] Many people have been
[2:00:07] healed just first time they came to the
[2:00:11] church. They come as curious people. But
[2:00:14] in listening, in listening they
[2:00:19] understood that is not just a bread
[2:00:21] winner but this is the truth and the
[2:00:25] truth
[2:00:27] will deliver you and many
[2:00:30] people have been delivered that
[2:00:33] way. The Bible
[2:00:36] says yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:00:41] You don't need for people to just lay
[2:00:43] hands on
[2:00:44] you. What you
[2:00:46] need is in the word that's been
[2:00:48] preached. If you believe
[2:00:52] it, you can do more than your thinking.
[2:00:58] In this Bible,
[2:01:02] there's a lot of testimonies
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:06] men and women that were
[2:01:11] determined to rest upon Jesus Christ
[2:01:14] regardless of whatever was happening
[2:01:16] around
[2:01:20] them. They understood that with without
[2:01:23] Jesus Christ they were
[2:01:24] done. They saw in him
[2:01:30] the eternal achievement that was
[2:01:32] authentic
[2:01:36] and they took position for him
[2:01:38] regardless of age. They rested upon
[2:01:43] him. Uh I was thinking about the case of
[2:01:47] Gyrus. If I could read that in the Bible
[2:01:51] in Mark chapter
[2:01:54] 5 verse 22.
[2:02:00] And then they came one of the the the
[2:02:03] chieft of the synagogues.
[2:02:05] His name was Gyrus.
[2:02:09] Whom when he saw Jesus.
[2:02:12] He he uh when he saw him he fell at his
[2:02:16] feet.
[2:02:19] He was a man who was who had a a they
[2:02:22] had a regard of him in the
[2:02:28] church. And Jesus was somebody that
[2:02:31] people didn't want him in the
[2:02:34] church. But Gyrus find himself in a very
[2:02:38] difficult state.
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:44] He only saw he saw nothing else except
[2:02:47] in Jesus that which he was looking for.
[2:02:52] And as a religious
[2:02:56] person, he know he
[2:02:59] knew he knew that you couldn't kneel
[2:03:01] before a
[2:03:02] man. But when he saw Jesus, the Bible
[2:03:06] said he he went and he fell down at his
[2:03:09] feet.
[2:03:12] because he found in Jesus more than a
[2:03:15] man. Brother, Jesus is more than a
[2:03:19] man. And as I'm speaking to you, he's
[2:03:22] here right now because he said, "Where
[2:03:26] two or three gather in my name, I will
[2:03:31] be in the midst." If you believe
[2:03:34] that, many things can happen.
[2:03:38] He I fall to his
[2:03:43] feet and and and besought him greatly,
[2:03:49] saying, "Is this this?" Yeah.
[2:03:55] He besought him greatly,
[2:03:59] saying, "My little daughter daughter
[2:04:06] lith at the point of death. I pray he
[2:04:09] come and laid a hand on her and she may
[2:04:12] be
[2:04:15] healed." Gyrus saw in Jesus the
[2:04:18] salvation of her daughter.
[2:04:21] The doctors could not help him.
[2:04:25] We we we go through things in life about
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:29] health and where doctors can do
[2:04:32] nothing. But let me tell you that our
[2:04:36] Jesus will heal
[2:04:38] all. And even if he doesn't heal
[2:04:41] me, love him and serve him always.
[2:04:47] You saw me read my Bible
[2:04:50] without
[2:04:51] glasses. I was
[2:04:54] condemned. They had to do surgery for
[2:04:58] cataract with three three
[2:05:00] times. But God extended his hand. I
[2:05:04] threw away the
[2:05:05] glasses and today I can read the Bible
[2:05:08] without
[2:05:09] glasses without
[2:05:12] being God is here this morning.
[2:05:16] He can do it for you.
[2:05:20] I can give my testimony one day that you
[2:05:22] already know because this
[2:05:26] testimony helps a lot of people
[2:05:30] I was uh uh operated upon for the the
[2:05:33] the the on my spine
[2:05:37] uh in
[2:05:39] 2001 I'm sorry in 2002
[2:05:42] 2000 2001 2001
[2:05:46] and when they they did surgery
[2:05:48] They told
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:50] me there's another disc up
[2:05:53] here that has gotten old
[2:05:58] that will cause problems later on.
[2:06:02] It was in
[2:06:03] 2001 in
[2:06:05] 2007. I was on my bed and when I moved I
[2:06:10] I was screaming
[2:06:12] pain and I couldn't move anymore.
[2:06:16] The first surgery
[2:06:20] It kept me almost I felt like I was
[2:06:21] divided in a house.
[2:06:24] I felt like I was divided.
[2:06:27] They took uh one of the
[2:06:31] discs
[2:06:33] and for about five years from 2001 to
[2:06:38] 2007 we always feel that
[2:06:41] separation between the top and the
[2:06:44] bottom. But in 2007
[2:06:47] When the pain for the upper disc started
[2:06:50] hurting, I go to the hospital. They do
[2:06:53] the
[2:06:56] test. That disc has also gone bad. We
[2:06:59] need to take it out. I said,
[2:07:01] "Lord, at my
[2:07:03] age, I'm going to get this other one
[2:07:05] taken out." I was troubled.
[2:07:09] God led me to go to
[2:07:13] church and to go and pray about 5:00
[2:07:16] a.m. in the morning.
[2:07:18] I just prayed just a little prayer. I
[2:07:21] said,
[2:07:23] "Lord, you are always the great
[2:07:28] creator. You can create a new disc on
[2:07:31] the one that's old." I I pray that way.
[2:07:34] Amen. I said, "Amen."
[2:07:37] Three days later,
[2:07:39] three days later, I'm telling you the
[2:07:42] truth, I'm
[2:07:45] sleeping. I saw that I was on the bed uh
[2:07:49] in the hospital bed and I was I had just
[2:07:52] had surgery with this up here
[2:07:57] and as I was coming out of uh uh the
[2:08:01] anesthesia and there was a doctor
[2:08:03] standing next to
[2:08:05] me. He said I want you to go on the bed
[2:08:08] the other bed that's
[2:08:10] lower. I said no I have a lot of pain. I
[2:08:13] can't. He commanded me
[2:08:16] go
[2:08:17] down. And when I obeyed to his word to
[2:08:20] go
[2:08:21] down, I screamed of pain. And I and then
[2:08:25] I was on that bed. When I woke up, I
[2:08:29] moved there's no pain. I moved and here
[2:08:33] there's no more pain. I saw it. I did
[2:08:39] things. I can go up on mountains.
[2:08:43] Um uh I went on the um camel mountain
[2:08:47] camel back camel mountain Arizona uh
[2:08:50] camel back mountain in
[2:08:53] Arizona to go all the way up for two
[2:08:56] hours. I never had any more pain and
[2:09:00] that
[2:09:02] God is listening to your cry.
[2:09:07] He knows your pain.
[2:09:10] You can do more than you can ask
[2:09:14] if you give your faith to him. If you
[2:09:18] only believe, all things are
[2:09:22] possible. And Gyrus,
[2:09:25] what did Gyrus
[2:09:26] do? He brought Jesus to his house. You
[2:09:30] know the
[2:09:31] story when he got
[2:09:33] [Music]
[2:09:35] there. The child that was already there,
[2:09:37] he raised them up.
[2:09:40] If we can go to the end,
[2:09:43] that same Jesus
[2:09:47] who's the only eternal achievement,
[2:09:51] he's not he's not a god of
[2:09:54] history. He's present and in his is in
[2:09:57] his
[2:09:59] word. When you only believe his word,
[2:10:04] you believe what's said in the
[2:10:05] scriptures,
[2:10:07] God will bring it to pass.
[2:10:11] God will bring what your desire is.
[2:10:16] Even when you don't have faith in coming
[2:10:20] here, but when you come back to
[2:10:22] everything that was
[2:10:24] said and you recognize it to be the
[2:10:28] truth, everything can change at that
[2:10:31] moment. I know a lot of
[2:10:34] people that have come and sit in
[2:10:39] churches just in listening a simple
[2:10:41] exhortation
[2:10:44] and to see the truth in the
[2:10:48] exhortation without talking to the
[2:10:50] pastor or the
[2:10:52] deacons they went back
[2:10:56] delivered the same God this
[2:10:59] morning let's bow our heads
[2:11:04] If the musicians could come at this
[2:11:06] time,
[2:11:07] my brother, my sister,
[2:11:09] let me tell you,
[2:11:14] we possess a Jesus that has died for
[2:11:19] us. We are not good. Trust
[2:11:22] me, we have never been good.
[2:11:27] No man will ever be good.
[2:11:30] My Jesus Christ.
[2:11:33] But Jesus Christ was the perfect
[2:11:35] sacrifice from God.
[2:11:38] And by his blood that was
[2:11:40] shed and by his uh obedience to the
[2:11:43] father,
[2:11:46] we can possess every gate of the
[2:11:49] enemy. We can triumph everything
[2:11:53] by Jesus Christ.
[2:11:56] We are eternally secured.
[2:12:00] We are we are eternally secure, my
[2:12:02] brother, my sister,
[2:12:04] if you believe for to into what he did
[2:12:06] for you. All that we
[2:12:11] need is a little into a conference with
[2:12:17] Jesus. When you are when things goes to
[2:12:20] where you don't
[2:12:21] understand with the events in this
[2:12:24] world all you
[2:12:27] need is a conference
[2:12:31] with Jesus Christ the eternal
[2:12:35] achievement and do have that conference
[2:12:38] in all
[2:12:40] understanding. It's going to fix
[2:12:42] everything.
[2:12:45] It's going to dissipate all the
[2:12:48] anguish friend Christians.
[2:12:53] You know that he loves you in his mercy.
[2:12:58] You don't merit his
[2:13:00] love. We merit or we all merit
[2:13:03] help. But in his mercy, but in his
[2:13:06] grace, he loves
[2:13:10] us. He took our place at the cross.
[2:13:14] We have one thing to do
[2:13:18] is to remind him of his promise. You
[2:13:21] said that you will never leave me. Just
[2:13:25] remind him of you will never leave me.
[2:13:29] You will never forsake
[2:13:31] me. You believe that with all your
[2:13:34] heart. Remind him that. Your promise
[2:13:38] says that you you you you swear by your
[2:13:42] own self that you will never leave me
[2:13:46] that you will never forsake me.
[2:13:50] Lord, take my heart as I give it to
[2:13:54] you that you may take away all the
[2:13:57] doubts that from this time
[2:14:00] on you are my perfect eternal
[2:14:04] achievement.
[2:14:06] I want more of you in my life from day
[2:14:08] on. Oh God,
[2:14:10] I want more of you.
[2:14:14] Let me lean upon you, oh Lord,
[2:14:17] knowing that all all other things
[2:14:20] will only be sinking sand.
[2:14:24] Oh great Jehovah,
[2:14:27] thank you for
[2:14:28] you. Thank you for the people Lord that
[2:14:32] have follow with attention. My prayer
[2:14:35] Lord that the benefit of this
[2:14:38] message of this end time
[2:14:41] message may be a portion for each one.
[2:14:45] You know every
[2:14:47] need not working in the life of the
[2:14:50] person. that you said that it's by your
[2:14:54] your your your your
[2:14:57] merrices that we have been healed by
[2:14:59] your stripes and that is in the past.
[2:15:03] And as your servant
[2:15:05] in the name of Jesus
[2:15:08] Christ, I declare of no power all demons
[2:15:12] of sickness.
[2:15:14] cast them out in the name of
[2:15:17] Jesus and I declare my brother my
[2:15:20] sisters all that believe
[2:15:23] I declare them well
[2:15:25] in the name of Jesus Christ. Thank you
[2:15:28] Lord. Thank you God. Bless our pastor.
[2:15:33] Bless this
[2:15:34] church and all the glory comes to you in
[2:15:38] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:15:41] Amen.
[2:15:56] Wasn't that wonderful?
[2:15:59] I'm certainly believe that it spoke to
[2:16:02] my heart. Let's stand together this
[2:16:04] morning.
[2:16:26] I
[2:16:28] enjoyed how
[2:16:30] wonderfully our
[2:16:32] brother raised him up out of history.
[2:16:37] Many people think of the Lord Jesus as
[2:16:39] being the man that walked 2,000 years
[2:16:44] ago and they look back on the history of
[2:16:48] what that he
[2:16:51] was. But to realize that he is alive in
[2:16:55] his word
[2:16:58] today and he's here present with
[2:17:02] us and he's still here to do exceedingly
[2:17:05] and
[2:17:06] abundantly above what we can ask or
[2:17:09] think.
[2:17:15] And I love how our brother brought out
[2:17:18] about
[2:17:20] Gyrus when Gyrus saw
[2:17:26] him. Gyrus knew because the Jews were
[2:17:30] taught he even said why do you call me
[2:17:33] good? You know that no man is good but
[2:17:35] the father. So if I'm good,
[2:17:39] who must it
[2:17:41] be? Gyrus knew better. But when he saw
[2:17:45] Jesus, he fell at his
[2:17:48] feet, he wasn't
[2:17:52] ashamed. Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of
[2:17:54] the gospel of Jesus Christ because it's
[2:17:56] the power of God and his salvation."
[2:18:01] And in the same chapter that our brother
[2:18:03] read out
[2:18:05] of, they began to question Jesus. And
[2:18:09] they said and and
[2:18:11] they
[2:18:13] they murmured amongst themselves
[2:18:16] saying and they said, "Is
[2:18:19] this not this Jesus the son of Joseph
[2:18:23] whose father and mother we know? And how
[2:18:26] is it then that he saith, I come down
[2:18:29] from
[2:18:33] heaven? And then Jesus just simply
[2:18:36] answered. He
[2:18:37] says, why do
[2:18:40] you why murmur
[2:18:43] not amongst
[2:18:46] yourselves? And then he speaks these
[2:18:49] words. And these are the words I want to
[2:18:51] ask you this
[2:18:53] morning. If you listen this
[2:18:56] morning, Jesus therefore answered and
[2:19:00] said unto them, No man can come to
[2:19:05] me except the father which hath sent me
[2:19:10] draw him and I will raise him up in the
[2:19:15] last
[2:19:15] day. And my question simply this
[2:19:18] morning, I hope that you did.
[2:19:23] Did you feel him drawing you this
[2:19:27] morning? Did you feel the
[2:19:31] word calling
[2:19:34] you? Did Did you see him move towards
[2:19:38] you?
[2:19:40] Did he draw an eye nigh unto you this
[2:19:43] morning and talk to your
[2:19:47] heart as you heard the word of God and
[2:19:50] you heard the power of God and you heard
[2:19:53] the
[2:19:55] testimonies? Did you find him calling
[2:19:58] you to
[2:19:59] a maybe a little higher
[2:20:04] walk? And that's the question this
[2:20:07] morning.
[2:20:10] Will you answer that
[2:20:13] call? I know I can do better this
[2:20:18] morning. I'll stand in front of
[2:20:20] everybody. I know I can do
[2:20:25] better. I feel a
[2:20:28] pull to do
[2:20:32] better. And I'm asking you this morning,
[2:20:35] maybe you don't know him.
[2:20:38] You don't know the power of the God that
[2:20:41] our brother spoke about this
[2:20:45] morning. I mean, you know it exists, but
[2:20:48] you've never experienced it for
[2:20:52] yourself. You've never experienced his
[2:20:55] touch. You've never surrendered to
[2:21:01] him. And you feel that call this
[2:21:05] morning. and you feel that draw this
[2:21:09] morning and you want to invite
[2:21:15] him into your
[2:21:22] life. You want to say, "Lord Jesus, I
[2:21:25] heard a man talk about you this morning,
[2:21:29] and I could tell that he knew what he
[2:21:33] was talking about.
[2:21:35] He
[2:21:37] experienced your reality and I can see
[2:21:41] your reality in his life through his
[2:21:46] testimony and and I want that in my
[2:21:49] life. I can't have his
[2:21:53] experience but I want my own
[2:21:58] experience. I know you historically
[2:22:01] Lord. I know what you can do. I know all
[2:22:04] about you, but like this morning, I feel
[2:22:07] you personally drawing me to you. I
[2:22:12] heard the words. I heard what he was
[2:22:14] saying. I heard the call on my
[2:22:18] heart. I heard you tugging at my my
[2:22:25] soul. You're inviting me to come to you.
[2:22:31] I want to give you that
[2:22:34] opportunity this
[2:22:36] morning to
[2:22:38] answer that
[2:22:41] draw because you can't even come to the
[2:22:44] father unless he draws you.
[2:22:50] You
[2:22:52] can't even know him
[2:22:55] unless he's invited
[2:22:58] you to know him.
[2:23:02] And I'm just asking you this
[2:23:04] morning if there's one amongst us that
[2:23:07] he's
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:12] invited, he's drawn
[2:23:15] you, he's touched
[2:23:17] you, and you felt him calling you to
[2:23:20] draw nigh unto
[2:23:23] him. if you wouldn't be ashamed
[2:23:27] and you'd like to come and be prayed
[2:23:34] for this
[2:23:36] morning. I want to make that
[2:23:41] opportunity for you to
[2:23:45] come. You can't come unless he draws. No
[2:23:48] man can cometh unto me lest my father
[2:23:51] which hath sent me draw
[2:23:54] him. And you feel this morning you feel
[2:23:58] the
[2:23:58] pull on your heart. I'd like to sing
[2:24:02] that little song. There is a
[2:24:07] blood. Would you have a mic?
[2:24:13] And I want to make the
[2:24:17] [Music]
[2:24:25] invitation to you this
[2:24:31] morning. Come unto me all ye that are
[2:24:34] heavy
[2:24:35] laden and I'll give you rest.
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:40] So you just pray in your heart and let's
[2:24:43] trust our Lord. Help me sing it. There
[2:24:47] is a
[2:24:50] death that cost
[2:24:55] life that came by
[2:24:59] wing and death.
[2:25:05] Let it
[2:25:07] flow down from the
[2:25:11] cross. My sin
[2:25:16] forgone. My sins forgone.
[2:25:21] There is a
[2:25:23] [Music]
[2:25:24] grave that tried to
[2:25:28] find his precious
[2:25:32] blood that gave me life.
[2:25:37] But
[2:25:38] [Music]
[2:25:41] he breathe
[2:25:45] again and
[2:25:49] ro in my
[2:25:53] face. So I
[2:25:56] come to tell you he's
[2:26:00] alive. to tell you that he
[2:26:05] cries every tear and all.
[2:26:11] And so I
[2:26:13] come to tell you that he's
[2:26:17] safe, to shout and to
[2:26:21] pro that he's coming back for you.

[2:28:18] heart.

[2:32:02] need of? I trust this
[2:32:05] morning if he tugged at your heart this
[2:32:09] morning. And I trust that if you found
[2:32:11] yourself
[2:32:13] short in the sight of his
[2:32:15] word, that you didn't walk
[2:32:18] away and turn down his call. Cuz one day
[2:32:23] you'll never hear it.
[2:32:26] One day he won't draw you no more. He
[2:32:29] won't touch you no more. And you'll just
[2:32:32] go
[2:32:34] on living
[2:32:37] life. So you have to be honest with
[2:32:40] yourself this morning.
[2:32:44] If he spoke to
[2:32:46] you, you respond
[2:32:49] by the uplift of your hand
[2:32:53] by you respond to that
[2:32:56] draw. I I just beg you, don't turn them
[2:33:00] away. Don't turn them away. Maybe you
[2:33:03] just say, "I feel that.

[2:38:04] hearts and
[2:38:06] pulled upon them to come for prayer. We
[2:38:09] believe that they're going to receive a
[2:38:11] wonderful answer, don't you? And in your
[2:38:14] own personal heart this morning,
[2:38:17] if you reached out to touch the hem of
[2:38:21] his garment, you have
[2:38:24] faith. You take what little faith you
[2:38:27] have and you mix it with the eternal
[2:38:29] word of God and see what God will do for
[2:38:32] you. If you've never been baptized in
[2:38:35] Christian baptism in the name of the
[2:38:38] Lord Jesus Christ, we have a pool
[2:38:42] available to
[2:38:45] you. If you want to just make
[2:38:48] that commitment in your life that you've

[2:39:32] and become a little more
[2:39:35] serious about the hour and the battle
[2:39:38] we're in. I just trust it's been a
[2:39:41] blessing to you this morning as it's
[2:39:44] been a blessing to me this morning. I
[2:39:48] appreciate it, brother Raphael, for the
[2:39:50] wonderful word of God this
[2:39:52] morning. It moved on my spirit as I'm
[2:39:56] sure it did yours also. Remember this
[2:39:59] evening is communion and footwashing.
[2:40:04] One of the things he pulls you to do,
[2:40:08] every believer that's in here that names
[2:40:11] the name of the word of the Lord is
[2:40:14] invited to come to communion and

[2:40:20] special effort. Amen. If you don't have
[2:40:24] enough gas, I'll help you with gas to
[2:40:26] come to communion.

[2:40:30] this world that you would rather do than
[2:40:34] come back to the house of the
[2:40:36] Lord and break bread
[2:40:40] and with the saints and take the cup of
[2:40:45] our redemption in memory of what that
[2:40:49] Eve done. Examine yourself,
[2:40:52] church. Examine yourself.
[2:40:57] The standards are

[2:41:03] us. So I I I just trust that you will
[2:41:08] look at your
[2:41:10] afternoon and see what you've placed
[2:41:16] ahead. Weigh yourself in the light of
[2:41:19] God's word and and start making the
[2:41:22] choices.
[2:41:26] that help you go down this great
[2:41:28] journey. Let us pray. Our gracious
[2:41:35] father, Lord, I believe with all my
[2:41:38] heart that you spoke to
[2:41:40] us this morning as an
[2:41:43] assembly and as
[2:41:49] individuals that each of us has to make
[2:41:52] that personal contact with you and your
[2:41:56] word.
[2:42:00] And that leadership,
[2:42:04] Father, must come into our hearts and
[2:42:07] our
[2:42:11] minds that we live solely
[2:42:15] and holy for
[2:42:19] you all the days of our
[2:42:23] life. Surrender,
[2:42:25] Father. And I thank you for reminding of
[2:42:29] that this morning that we must know
[2:42:34] you. We must be in fellowship with
[2:42:38] you and we must go to you and talk it
[2:42:41] over with
[2:42:45] you, Lord. That we would find you this
[2:42:48] morning.
[2:42:52] that we'd invite you into our hearts,
[2:42:54] invite you into our
[2:42:56] lives. Thank you, Father, once again,
[2:43:00] for reaching down and touching and
[2:43:04] drawing our
[2:43:08] hearts. And Father, for those whom you
[2:43:11] reached this morning and they felt the
[2:43:14] pull. And father, maybe their battle in
[2:43:17] their mind was so strong that they just
[2:43:21] didn't know how to
[2:43:22] move towards
[2:43:25] you. I pray, Father, that you would
[2:43:28] enlighten them and
[2:43:30] con continue to deal with their hearts
[2:43:33] and continually to speak to them.
[2:43:37] Father, they come to that hour of
[2:43:42] surrender where they throw it all down
[2:43:44] at your feet and they finally give
[2:43:49] up and they let you come into your their
[2:43:52] lives
[2:43:56] and and that you can abide with them
[2:44:00] even in them till the end. That's our
[2:44:04] prayer for each heart this morning.
[2:44:07] Lord, I know those you reached and
[2:44:09] touched some hearts this
[2:44:13] morning.
[2:44:15] Father,
[2:44:17] continue to draw
[2:44:19] us. Continue to give us the pull.
[2:44:25] [Music]
[2:44:27] Be not angry with this heart, gracious
[2:44:30] father,
[2:44:32] but let your grace be our portion. I
[2:44:35] pray. Bless this people tonight, this
[2:44:39] morning that have come
[2:44:41] out. Father, you've drawn back to you
[2:44:44] this evening to have a time of
[2:44:46] fellowship and footwashing and
[2:44:49] ministering to one another. I pray that
[2:44:52] you bless their day.
[2:44:54] I pray you bless their weak, Father. May
[2:44:56] they be prosperous in good health.
[2:44:59] Father, touch the sick and afflicted
[2:45:02] amongst us, the burdened
[2:45:05] heart. Lord, I I believe it was Sister
[2:45:08] Irish's friends
[2:45:10] that Lord
[2:45:13] have
[2:45:16] just entered in such a time of
[2:45:21] sorrow. Lord, we don't understand, but
[2:45:24] we know you know all
[2:45:27] things. I ask, Father, that you would
[2:45:29] just bless and I ask in your name
[2:45:32] because you said, "Ask anything of the
[2:45:35] Father in my name and he will grant it."
[2:45:39] So, Father, I come to you in that
[2:45:42] precious and wonderful name of
[2:45:44] Jesus and ask that you give
[2:45:48] some solace and comfort and touch to
[2:45:52] those young lives that
[2:45:55] were just
[2:45:57] taken from us.
[2:46:03] Father, may our hearts be tender.
[2:46:09] We ask these things in your precious
[2:46:12] name we pray. Amen. God bless you. Is
[2:46:17] God good all the time? Let's sing it.
