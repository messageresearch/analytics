Description:
The Same Jesus Tonight
Br. Paul Ossou
August 18, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

you're going through it doesn't matter the battle that you're fighting you praise him and you watch God move you heard it this morning put God first watch the miracle let's sing this song as we don't have many announcements musicians can play something um we don't just the ones that we have this morning if you just remember our our pastor and sister Leslie and the many loved ones of our body that have lost somebody and if you've got a need of your own on your heart and don't let the devil tell you that it's a little need that God won't hear it he hears every need even the ones you don't think he hears it's too small he cares about it all he cares about the little things so if you just have a need on your heart that you want to lift before the Lord by the uplifting of your hands do so trust and know he sees it and he will answer try him and see if he's not faithful there's one thing God can't do he can't lie he said if we came with our burdens and we place it in his hands he would take charge of them [Music] Hallelujah ask brother clever to come up and pray for ask Brothers for the and offerings to come up as well let us pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity to be gathered this afternoon Lord not to see one another but to have an audience with thee and we know father that you don't miss any appointments and so we're privileged to be in your presence and we come with all the requests even from this morning Lord and the individual ones and thanksgivings thanking you brother Tommy the testimony that he had of you touching his body I pray for a pastor who was visiting with his mom Lord I pray that you might continue to be with him give him the words to say in the situation and Lord we pray for even the tithes and the offering that are may they go to the furtherance of your kingdom we thank you Lord even for the word this morning Lord Lord encouraging us to seek first the kingdom of God for you know you shall add all these other things so we pray for all your children that are here some that didn't make it father may you provide for each one's individual need in the way that only you can and Lord May the word that comes forth speak to them individually in a way that father Hebrews tells us Lord that your word is is a two-edged sword Lord and it knows the intents and the desires of every heart so we pray asking you for all these things in the name of Jesus Christ we pray [Music] amen don't quite know the song but I want to sing it so we have a dilemma yall going to have to help me but let's sing reach and touch the Lord while he passes by Reach Out touch the Lord as he has his body you will find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry oh his by this moment your needs to reach and touch the Lord as he goes by lift your hands and reach out Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he pass is you will find he's not too busy to hear your heart cry oh his pass by this [Music] B Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he goes by once more as we ask sister Heidi to come up with your testimony Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he has his you will find he's not to buy to hear your Hearts Cry he's pass by this moment your needs to supply Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he hold by God bless you um I just wanted to give a quick testimony um because this is not my comfort zone and I'm sure my husband is like falling almost out of a sea because he didn't know that I was coming up here but um I just wanted to um just thank the Lord for his word and that it's true and um I wanted to thank the congregation and my family just for all the prayers um for me it's been 5 years since like symptoms had started those of you that know I have just like some kind of mysterious illness of like pain and the doctors can't really figure it out and it's been a long hard definitely the hardest trial I've ever been through and it's just been a long journey of just up and down and just really difficult and um yeah and just there's been many times that I've wanted to I felt like the Lord was trying to get me to come up and just fear would just stop me um from coming up because you know it hadn't happened yet it hadn't happened yet but I knew that I needed to testify and um be obedient to the word and make the confession that by his stripes I'm Healed and I believe it even though um my symptoms don't show it yet but just like when my daughter come up the other night I didn't I mean that was like an encouragement to me and I felt like go I should have been the one that went up there first you know I was kind of like okay um but I mean just God moves in different ways so um I just want to thank everybody for praying for me and it's just meant so much to me and just been so humbling and it's it's just kind of a weird thing you can't really see it but it's there but I know God has just given me the grace to make it through and I just every day and um through the years and even at the beginning um I never testified of this and I should have but I had went into like a really bad depression I mean just like it was worse than like pain or anything I mean I've never experienced anything like that in my life like I couldn't even eat I couldn't anything I was just so just it was horrible and God just lifted that off of me and I was just like and I should have testified then but I I just let the fear and everything just stopped me so but um yeah so I just the word today was just like so good and I just feel so happy and joyful I mean I just feel so happy I just I'm just like I don't know I just feel like I don't even care I'm just happy and like um and like brother Matthew said sometimes you just got to start over and so I know it's been a long time coming for me kind of to my shame that I haven't been up here yet but I just wanted to be obedient to the word and I know that if I'm in his will that it's he has it all in control and and that it's for a purpose and that if God be me who can be against me and that no matter what like I'm not going to bow to the enemy and um I just want to say by his stripes I'm Healed and um just like he was saying today it's just lying vanities and I'm just going to keep confessing it until it happens hey and um watch the miracle like brother Matthew was saying and um that something Good's going to come out of the trial and um I was thinking why am I doing this you know why am I coming up here you know to testify or you know because I'm being obedient and God says to confess it and that you have to confess it first but also for like I know you can't really see it you know the symptom that I have but like for an unbeliever if they're watching out there I mean ultimately it's so when I come up here healed and it's manifested they can see that and know that God is real and and ultimately a conversion or just something for something else somebody else because all things work for the good to those that um love him and let's see anyways um yeah so I just wanted to thank everybody and I love you all so much and I just I can't express how much I love you all and I appreciate so much all the prayers and just being longsuffering and with me and just through the years really um I'm kind of a miracle in itself just my salvation is the biggest miracle that I have in my life so and I just thank my husband that's been just there for me me and never given up on me and put up with me and you know there's been those times where you know I've just wanted to crawl in a hole and just everybody nobody see never never see anybody again you know I just just how I don't know and he's just been there for me through all of it and always has confessed it and always confessed it and I'm just grateful for my family and for all that they've um been there for me through all of this and and just the last you know just I just feel like my faith is really rising up and I just really want to call that fear a lot you know the liar of you know like he was saying today that really struck me when he was like don't let fear be your Energizer you know don't let that be what gets you going or whatever so I just thought that was really good and I'm just so thankful and happy I'm just really happy I just really felt like that my heart just felt just Joy today and yeah so that's it come on Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah oh Hallelujah we serve a great God hallelujah he's the high priest of your confession the devil don't want you to confess it he wants you to keep looking at how you feel and how you look we're not looking at that we've got a whole another prescription that prescription says it's finished and because it's finished we can sing songs like every praise everything you've got don't let the cries Rock cry out in your place don't let the trees wave better than you come on somebody's got to praise him for all that he's done if she can after 5 years if you've never been in a trial before when brother Matthew mat Thomas had up

Be Your [Music] Name don't forget Brother David sister lesle where they are that the same presence that's here tonight may be with them also that you may fulfill all the desires of their heart bless every one of your children in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen hallelujah I believe we all happy tonight when our sister was testifying here I felt like jumping in the office God is so wonderful and I believe that the devil is really receiving real punches tonight we are so happy to serve a God Like Jesus Christ let's open our Bibles in John chapter 1 we'll read from the first verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with Gods all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not uh let jump to the verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father Full of Grace and Truth uh let's go to Hebrew chapter chapter 13 verse 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Lord Jesus we have said it because we read it because you said it you are the same yesterday today and forever may you manifest that tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen have your seats we bless the name of the Lord tonight for his presence among us tonight and we believe that since this morning God is has been manifesting his presence after the morning service I went home and I started praying a lot I said I I ask God so he can bring a lot a lot of testimonies after this morning service and I told Brother Matthew in reality he preached a part of the sermon I wanted to preach I'm just going to add a little bit to what he has already said as the Lord will lead me because as I was looking for an inspiration for tonight's service I was in I went to prayer and as I was praying uh what really doesn't happen that much I I fall asleep while I was praying so I was I was kneeling and I fall asleep I saw myself come to the pulpit and I announced what was the my title the same Jesus tonight the same Jesus tonight I'm sorry that's my title tonight the same Jesus tonight the same Jesus that we saw manifested this morning it's the same Jesus who's Among Us t you know when I after I woke up from the sleep in this dream I had this little note and so I really didn't want to take a lot of notes I took about uh three uh quotes and then I said the rest I'll see how the Lord will lead me because it's him who knows what's in my heart and it's him who knows what's in your heart he knows the need of every one of us and he knows how to bring the need of each and everyone to be fulfilled and when sister Heidi gave the testimony and how God LED brother Beno to continue in the worship because there was a presence of the Lord I told Brother Billy in the office I understood why God didn't want me to write down a lot of notes because a part of my my my service is the testimony of sister heid so she started the and I believe the same God that she testified about will manifest his glory in her life and that each and every one of us regardless of the needs you're going to have same God is able to do great things because it's the same [Music] tonight today Jesus did things is the same tonight that's able to bring great things in the life of each and every one of us what God is asking usam would say that what God is asking of us is to have faith all that he's asking [Music] us the greatest thing thing that we have to do is to believe that he hears our prayers rest the rest even when a miracle will come to pass it's not us it's not our work that's his part that's him that's going to do it because he's the one only one that can make Miracles we don't have Capac capacity to bring forth Miracles but he has the capacity to do that he capable of bringing something so he can assure us that he's with us to assure us that he is our God that is the same that he's the the only one that he doesn't have limits that he doesn't know the the word impossible you know when we want to talk about Jesus when we start from Genesis we have Jesus everything that was done even in the Old Testament we have Jesus but I'm says when Jesus when David went before Goliath he took five Stones it was the name of Jesus thankes Mo Moses god did great things through Moses and we know when God went to meet uh uh meet with Moses he told Moses I am the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob Mo Moses told him all that I know but what is your name tell me your name what is your name because I'm going to go what is your name he told him I'm called I am my name is I am the one who's always at present so when the present there I am went with Moses when Jesus himself came he says Abraham when he saw my day so that means even Moses he saw my day all those that were in the past it was with me that they walk with it was because of me that they fulfilled the things that they did because the Bible tells us that not none of the things that were created that we were created without him and we saw Jesus he took the children of Israel from from Egypt unto the promised land it was a a a a travel that should have only taken couple of days so from only few days they should have gotten from Egypt they should have taken from Egypt onto the promised land but God he he he allowed for them to go through the desert and to go 40 years years in this journey and the 40 years in the journey there was no shop shopping places where they will go buy clothes there were none with the same clothes the same shoes everything that they had for 40 years I don't know how they were doing it I I don't know how they were making the child who was going how they would make their clothes go taller I don't know how they would make the shoes of the kids go longer but all that I know that this God was able to understand the need of the children of Israel and to bring the solution that was needful when he understood that they were hungry he he rain Mana from Heaven I don't know how that was cooked I don't know what what kind of oven that was but all that I know that God let the Mana fall down from because he didn't want his children to go hungry and when they got to a place where they were thirsty where they were thirsty they didn't know what to do God Called Moses he didn't create a river he brought them to the place the most dry place in the desert The Rock he said hit the rock Moses hit the rock and water came out of the rock they they drank in abundance and when we read that we have the impression that when they drank I I was I was reading and trying to read it in Exodus I thought that they drank but the rock stay there and then they continue to walk but when I got to Corinthians Corinthians 10 and 4 Paul is saying that The Rock was following them how how how come on come on how God put legs on this rock so the rock can follow them so they will never be thirsty so so he can provide to the to their thirst the rock that was following them Arington when they go from Bedford to Arlington the rock is there the alington for they're go from alington to forward the rock is there come on how hallelujah hallelujah the that same God is here [Applause] tonight that same Rock the Bible tells us that same Rock was Christ amen the same Christ is here tonight to provide to your need to answer to your needs so he can answer to your problem says in the message redemption in in completeness and joy uh preach on uh uh uh March 30th 1954 paragraph 216 he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out we bless the name of the Lord because we're not going to keep quiet sister Heidi didn't keep quiet Hallelujah we testify we're going to continue to testify the same God tonight he's capable to break every Power of the Devil he's able to defeat the Devil at any ground he says why why what that the very Rock that was heed out of the mountain without hands was coming rolling into Jerusalem the Little Rock was drinking from it speak to

presence is right now here now to heal every one of you I believe it I know it with all my heart I believe his presence is here to heal every sick regardless of what situation you find yourself in Jesus tonight like we heard this morning everything is we have all everything has been served on the table there's not a thing that doesn't meet the need regardless of the condition you have you may have tried everything that you could do uh based on what everything that you could do like Peter a a professional sinner no a a professional uh uh fisherman yes [Laughter] fisherman I on the with with his professional team they fished all night they they they look for job all the time they couldn't find anything they knew that if they couldn't catch anything financially they would have been in a hard place they feast all night they did everything that they could they didn't catch anything but as they were doing it the rock was looking at them Jesus was looking at them Jesus was not far from there he came closer to them they as you didn't find anything if you not find what you're looking for if you find not find what you're looking for come and do what I'm going to show you believe First my word give me the first place and then and then throw your net over here hallelujah hallelujah Peter knew according according to his knowledge that if I threw it over there we're not going to have any fish he says I know I already done that but now at your word because you said it because you pronounce it I'm going to do it again and then through the and he tried to pull it he needed hands Hallelujah that same God is here [Music] tonight so he can provide to your need Jesus himself he didn't have money to pay the taxes what did he do he says Peter go to such and such place I want you to take your fishing po throw it amen and bring forth the fish that you're going to cut just open his mouth tonight if you have a need God is able to take a Peter to to make you a fisherman so you can got a fish and open his mouth for you the same God but what he wants from us so we can place him first like we heard it this morning like a woman of this widow woman that she all she had left was for her and the kids so they can eat and die that's all that was left of her but look at this man comes I don't know his appearance but he says I'm a servant of God I bring you the word of God now when we read that story we all think we were going to do like that woman of s but the same word is being preached tonight and God wants us to have the same attitude as that [Applause] woman he said I know that everything that what's left of you is for you to cook that little meal with for your child and you and your child you'll die but I'm telling you th sayth the Lord make me first God first rest and the rest you will see the Miracles God first that's what Jesus is telling us tonight regardless of your problem oh we can go from problem to problem even if you are a sinner sin we yes sorry it's the same word for both yes even if you are a sinner and you've sinned every time one time there was a woman that was caught in PL adultery it there was no you couldn't contest it they caught her so the Pharisees instead of them just stoning her themselves they could have found a solution according to their own thinking they decided to take him through the Jesus that we have tonight Jesus look at this woman we caught her in adultery right the the scripture says the soul that sinth is the soul that dies she has to Die the scripture says that the adulterers will not get into the kingdom of God and what what do you say Jesus began to write he started writing and everyone was looking and coming look I'm not sure what he was writing but I imagine everyone they will look Paul you that the one who has the biggest Stone did you do you remember what you did yesterday if you try I'll tell everybody what you did yesterday pass John came John if even you try and you will see yourself the the Roger came by oh Roger everyone was coming and will throw away their Stone and then they will go on they will continue and when Jesus lift his head up there's nobody so he says woman where all their accusers he told them that every one of you who has never sinned let him throw the first stone and that was before and then he started writing so every one of them they found themselves they all realized that they were just Sinners saved by grace that they had no no right to to to stop that same Grace to be extended to another human being says that before God a preacher regardless of what power he has he's not more than a a drunken that comes into the house of God and he gives his life to the Lord and when Jesus looks at this woman he says even I not I but he doesn't he didn't have any sin he was the word made flesh he was the pardon he was the perfect love he says not even I I'm not going to condem you but one condition be careful go and say no more I'm giving you the grace go and sin no more come to me if it's your situation the same Jesus is here tonight to forgive you it to tell you go and sin no more the S sinning is not your place you are a daughter of God you are a son of God the devil probably took you in that condition but Like an Eagle EET you you heard the voice of Mother Eagle flap your wings leave those things behind and come forward but talks about uh uh the the story of uh Johnny crow that there was a farmers who tied his Johnny C to a tree that every time that he will try to fly he couldn't go far every time he'll go try and come down and then he started only going around circles around the tree he was only going around the tree and he was so used to going around the tree that one day there was someone who was coming by who looked at his condition that was miserable and he went and went ahead and cut the rope but Johnny C continued to go in circles he didn't realize that Jesus brought solution to his problem that he was once again able to fly sometimes it's how the devil tries to keep the children of God but Jesus is here to cut the RO it says you are able to fly you are able to go far but we have to put God first says in the message unw welcome Christ paragraph 31 uh preaching preaching August August 28th 1955 listen I want to ask you something now did you ever pray for Jesus to come to your house that's what we do every day if you did say and and if he comes to your house am say Amen sure you have how did you treat him when he when he came did you give him a little place in the Attic maybe your sewing party there that day when Jesus comes to your heart do you feel like crying you feel like weeping you feel like praising him but what do you do with him you put him up in the attic you go up in the attic over in the little room or down in the cellar and you get down there and say uh thank you Jesus or or something or something you are asham of him before your company if it's so it says and then if you are if it's so if you are then you ought to repent today amen amen give Jesus the first place first place first in life first your best not your second your first seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and other things will be added do you let him sit back and and when when you are talking to your boss and and and and it says and Jesus comes down and he wants you to testify to him and tell to your boss about the love of God that's in your heart Are you ashamed of him do you give him a little corner am I ask this to Jesus Jesus will you take the second place yeah will you take the third place yeah will you take the fifth place yeah yes I'll come anyhow you think your neighbor will come if we'll take the fifth place no no that's what makes me love him makes me know he's he's the he's the he's the god in of Heaven he will take any place whatever place you give him he will take it he will come but he wants the first place it says he'll take any place any place that a man will give him some of you only go to church once a year oh my it's Easter morning you put on your most Charming uh uh garment your beautiful hat you go down to church and you sit uh 20 minutes and then when you come back and you say that settles it till next Easter does Jesus accept it amen amen yes AC he accepts it place you'll give him you'll accept it he will never rebuke you he'll not he never rebuke you he will take it that's why we love him he says oh yes we have other things too that we may think may we may think more important my brother my sister the most important thing in your life is to entertain Jesus Christ you believe that I believe that the most important thing in any life is to entertain Jesus Christ properly in first place in your worship first place in your life place first place in Everything Jesus Christ deserves that place amen amen I believe it with all my heart if you don't he will take the second place he'll go down in the basement with you if you are ashamed of him when you are among among with the people and then you go down in the basement so nobody will see you he still will come that ought to make you love him more above everything in the world Jesus in second place Jesus in fourth place Jesus in 10th place but still comes but but still he comes you invited him regardless whatever position you invite him in he will come he'll come to rescue you he's going to come to answer your prayer regardless of the situation when we go in the Bible we have so many situations that for every single one of our needs we know that Jesus will come we have even situations that are most extreme he may not come the same way like he did for the other or for the for the other we see for the blind Jesus only spoke he saw but the one who was born blind he he he mixed the the the the the the the ground and he and he put on his eyes and he says go wash yourself in go wash your eyes in the water so sometimes we wait oh I want God to give me the same testimony as brother Beno the same testimony as sister Heidi but God will give you your testimony the best way it will fit you how did Jesus call his disciples he was not the same way for some disciples Jesus would had need to manifest the signs of the son of man that you are you are Simon the barjon for other disciples the Bible says that uh James and John the sons of zebede they were with their father they were fixing their net look at this man who was going by who looks at them and says you and you follow me they let the net and they started following him and they are disciples they Apostles of Jesus Christ there was no demonstration of power for them to become disciples they heard the word the word of Jesus Christ come follow me I'll make of you fishes of man God answers according to his own way but what we have to know that he hears our prayers and Jesus before the the tomb of Lazarus a most desperate situation it's never happened before a person who died for four days he he started smelling and Jesus looked at him before Lazarus died Jesus said oh his situation it was for the glory of God like the blind who was born blind who who sinned nobody sinned it's for the glory of God Jesus stands before the tomb of Lazarus A desperate situation my brother is your situation A desperate situation is your situation A desperate situation look at Jesus he presents himself when he presents himself tonight he says father I know that th hears my prayers always hallelujah hallelujah I know that you always hear my prayers that's why when we pray we pray in the name of Jesus Jesus Takes that prayer father I know that you hear my prayers always Lazarus come out look at another desperate situation the the thief on the cross it was the end of life criminal all life long abandoned all life long but he had the privilege to find himself at the last minute of Life next to Jesus who's here tonight it said I know who you are I know that you are here that when you go to your glory I may not be worthy to say forgive me because all that I did I deserve I don't deserve a pardon but when you go to your glory remember me he just recognized the presence of God he never went to the water baptism he never went to a church he never had a pastor P but he went in the kingdom of God he was abandoned all his life because God when you invite him he comes always when you pray to him ex he hears you always sometimes it's us that become impatient we imagine under what circumstance or how is he going to answer to my my prayer but he knows how he's going to answer but what talks about the story of Abraham and jobed we're going to finish with that he was explaining how hard it was for the children of Israel how it was a weight for hamam how amam prayed always says teaching on mes paragraph 79 um a little bit up he will talk about how amram every time he came home I'm going to go to paragraph 79 now so he's talking about amram him his family and his wife and then it says so so after they had eaten supper the little boy talking about the little boy the two girls it was uh uh Aaron and and Miriam he said they had just eaten and they all ate supper and the mother put the things away and they and and and and uh they tuck into the bed and then she goes into the room her and her husband they sat down she said well now what was it that you saw today Amron that made you so upset tonight that you didn't you didn't even want to uh to live it says oh said darling I just can't understand it he said we see it every day but today especially I seen an an awful awfulest side I ever seen he said I seen the awfulest sight I've ever seen said our poor boys some of them not even 12 years old pulling that big old wagon with ropes around their neck like that those poor little kids in the pulled till they couldn't pull no more up that great big incline those big Stone back there and they couldn't go no further and after a while the the wagon the wagon began to Creak and go real real slow and after a while it stopped down the road came a man oh he was a maniac he roared out why are you stopping this wagon wh with this great big old snake whip whipping them across the back the blood running out of their back and run down like that and the poor little kids just hung onto those rope and cried said oh what can we do mother said we are the people of God God blessed us we are the children of Abraham Isaac and Jacob why will we be uh we why why will we be to be slav down here down here and these things oh it's terrible how those poor boys cried oh I pray and I prayed and I prayed and he seems like God does God just don't even hear me sometimes we have that imp impression that we pray we pray again it seems like God doesn't hear us it was the situation for them it says it seems like it seems like it turned his death ears and then and then he says am that don't sound like Hallelujah that don't sound like you my brother my sister that don't sound like you that don't sound like you you are a real daddy and don't sound like you because you you always encouraging us telling us to have faith in God ohra amram said oh but dear when I pray so much and still God don't hear me and it seems like it just gets worse all the time the more I pray the worse it gets sometimes we have that impression that the more we pray the worse he G was having a Sunday school with the kids and I believe we are all kids because the Bible says that the kingdom of God is those that that are like children and paragraph 84 will say but little boys and girls does God hear prayers he hears prayers does God answer prayers yes does he answer real quick not all the time does he no no sometimes he makes us wait is that right but God answers prayers he does doesn't he and just because everything is going [Music] wrong that's not sign we should quit praying we just pray on any don't we that's right now you've answered right God answers prayers let's all say together God answers prayer yes no matter what the circumstances are he answers anyhow God always answer prayers no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in says even when we give him the 10th place he will come ex he he will hear he will testify of his love to you and he continues to knock he says I'm the rock that's near you I am at the 10th place but but I want to be the first place I love you always I want to be at the first place you are my son you are my daughter you're going to be like me I want to have the first place and you will see the Miracles and you will see the power let's all stand the same Jesus is here tonight to answer to our our prayers there's no situations in which we are going through who God where God doesn't have a solution but he's asking us to believe he's asking us to take the word he's asking us to believe his word and he will come and fulfill the rest he wants us to testify of his glory you know it's the same way that God wants us to testify of his love God the devil also wants us to testify of his glory how does the devil wants us to testify of his glory oh my sickness it's about 10 years that I've been suffering for this my sickness are my demon here we testifying but Jesus once that regardless of how many years you've been sick the woman with the issue of blood she was 12 years she she spent everything but just the Hem of Jesus garment was the
