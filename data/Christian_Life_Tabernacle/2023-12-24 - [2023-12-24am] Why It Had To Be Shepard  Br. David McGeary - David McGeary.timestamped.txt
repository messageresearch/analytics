[5:38] appreciative so grateful so dependent
[5:41] upon your presence Lord when we gather
[5:44] together Lord It's not to accomplish
[5:46] some religious ceremony Lord as so many
[5:48] do on Christmas Eve to come together and
[5:51] fulfill a religious obligation Lord
[5:53] that's not what we're interested in
[5:55] that's not what you've called us to Lord
[5:57] we come here with a promise that if we
[6:00] Gather in your name you'll meet us here
[6:03] Lord we look forward to what you have
[6:04] for us today Father we commit the
[6:06] service to you that all would be done
[6:08] according to your will Lord that that
[6:10] which you have determined to accomplish
[6:12] today would be done Lord that every need
[6:15] that's presented to you Lord you know
[6:17] the answer I pray that you would come
[6:18] alongside us and meet that Lord would
[6:20] you bless the man of God as he comes and
[6:22] speaks the word that your word would be
[6:24] made known Lord may you bless the
[6:26] service all that is done to worship and
[6:28] magnify you that you would be glorified
[6:31] and we pray this in Jesus name amen you
[6:34] can be
[6:36] seated Merry
[6:39] Christmas it's Christmas Eve today you
[6:43] know one of the portions of scripture
[6:45] that we
[6:45] he quoted and repeated and sung you know
[6:51] pretty much from every corner in the
[6:52] land
[6:53] is you know Luke 2 where it tells that
[6:56] story of one who came and how how a
[7:00] angel and heavenly host appeared to
[7:02] Shepherds one night on the
[7:04] hillside you know as they began to if
[7:07] they announced his coming and they began
[7:09] to praise the Lord they made a statement
[7:12] in Luke
[7:14] 2:14 that said glory to God in the
[7:17] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[7:22] toward
[7:23] men you know it's something that is
[7:26] proclaimed throughout the Christmas
[7:28] season there's decorations peace on
[7:31] Earth people sing about peace on
[7:34] Earth but what's interesting is this one
[7:37] when he
[7:39] came whom the world attributes to peace
[7:42] on
[7:43] Earth and he started to go about the
[7:45] father's
[7:47] business he made statements like this in
[7:49] Luke
[7:51] 12:51 suppose ye that I am come to give
[7:55] peace on
[7:56] Earth I tell you nay but rather
[8:01] division he said it this way in Matthew
[8:03] 10:34 think not that I am come to send
[8:08] peace on
[8:09] Earth I came not to send peace but a
[8:14] sword somehow that part doesn't find its
[8:17] way into the Christmas songs or the
[8:21] Christmas
[8:23] decorations Jes he said in Matthew 11
[8:26] from the days of John the Baptist until
[8:28] now
[8:30] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[8:32] violence and the violent take it by
[8:36] force what happened to peace on
[8:41] Earth you know when Christmas comes
[8:43] along and everyone talks about peace on
[8:46] Earth you know so many times they're
[8:48] thinking about a
[8:50] carnal Earthly version of
[8:54] Peace you know the Jews thought that
[8:56] when Messiah
[8:57] came he would push out the enemy and
[9:00] allow Israel to live at peace with the
[9:04] Nations you know and even today people
[9:06] speak of Peace On Earth as an end of war
[9:09] and famine and how people live in some
[9:12] idilic State here on Earth in harmony
[9:16] with one
[9:17] another but that's not the kind of peace
[9:20] on
[9:21] Earth that he came to
[9:23] bring in fact in Luke 4 when Jesus was
[9:26] being tempted by the enemy
[9:30] the enemy rightly identified that all
[9:32] the kingdoms of the Earth had been given
[9:33] to him and were his
[9:36] domain establishing peace between the
[9:39] devil's kingdoms was not his
[9:43] program instead of bringing peace on
[9:46] Earth he created
[9:49] conflict you know he brought forth a
[9:52] word which clashed with all of the
[9:55] social and political and religious and
[9:58] cultural natur Al Norms of the
[10:02] day you know ultimately all but a few
[10:05] rejected
[10:06] him and ultimately they sought to kill
[10:09] him peace on
[10:13] Earth I came not to send peace but a
[10:17] sword you know what's funny is Jesus
[10:19] never sought to do battle with anyone he
[10:22] never went out to fight or argue or
[10:26] cause dissension or any of that all he
[10:30] ever did was make known the
[10:34] word he said in John 5:19 verily verily
[10:38] I say unto you the son can do nothing of
[10:43] himself but what he seeth the father
[10:47] do all he ever did was present the word
[10:50] to say and do exactly what the father
[10:53] showed him to
[10:55] do and the only result was that all
[10:58] things were put in in their position
[10:59] according to the
[11:02] word it was thus saith the Lord or keep
[11:08] still he did just what the father showed
[11:12] him you know that thought was on my mind
[11:14] is I began reading Psalm 144 this
[11:17] weekend you want to turn to that we'll
[11:19] be reading that
[11:20] today and it begins with an interesting
[11:24] statement the first couple
[11:26] verses says blessed be the Lord my
[11:29] strength which teacheth My Hands to War
[11:33] amen and my fingers to
[11:37] fight my goodness and my
[11:40] Fortress my high tower and my
[11:43] deliverer my shield and he in whom I
[11:48] trust who subdueth my people under
[11:51] me it's an interesting statement he
[11:55] teaches me to
[11:56] fight he teaches me how to to fight out
[12:00] of
[12:01] War you know if we're not careful though
[12:03] we can get caught up in this idea that
[12:05] we're to be running around defeating
[12:08] Devils but you just never saw Jesus do
[12:11] anything like
[12:13] that you know doing battle with the
[12:16] Enemy or measuring ourselves by how many
[12:19] Devils we
[12:22] defeat but just as you know I think just
[12:25] as the Lord's version of peace on Earth
[12:27] is different than ours I think the
[12:28] Lord's version of doing battle is
[12:30] different than ours as
[12:33] well you know James 4 said from whence
[12:36] cometh Wars and fightings among
[12:39] you come they not hint even of your own
[12:43] lusts that war in your members you see
[12:46] it's the opposite of I do nothing but
[12:49] what he showeth
[12:53] me Paul described that struggle this way
[12:56] in Romans 7:18 for I know that in me
[12:59] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[13:03] thing for to will is present with me but
[13:08] how to perform that which is good I find
[13:13] not you know notice here in Psalm 144 it
[13:17] doesn't speak of going out and fighting
[13:19] battles or winning
[13:21] wars it just speaks of teaching us
[13:25] how it says he is both my my refuge and
[13:30] my
[13:33] defense it says that I trust in
[13:36] him the margin of my Bible says I take
[13:40] refuge in
[13:43] him but we could read it this way as
[13:45] Jesus said in John
[13:48] 15 if ye abide in
[13:51] me and my words abide in
[13:54] you you shall ask what you
[13:57] will
[14:00] which if his words abide in
[14:03] you then your will and his will will be
[14:08] the same that's right you will know what
[14:11] he wants done with his
[14:15] word and it shall be done unto you thank
[14:17] you
[14:18] Lord not because you're a devil
[14:21] defeater but because you abide with a
[14:24] teacher and a teacher abides in
[14:27] you
[14:29] as he said John 15:5 for without me you
[14:33] can do
[14:35] nothing so what does he want
[14:39] Don he said in John 14:26 but the
[14:42] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[14:46] the father will send in my name he shall
[14:49] teach you all things including how to
[14:53] war and how to
[14:56] fight and bring all things to your
[14:58] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[15:00] you now notice what he says
[15:03] peace I leave with
[15:05] you peace on
[15:08] Earth my peace I give unto
[15:11] you not as the world giveth
[15:14] yeah give I unto you let not your heart
[15:17] be troubled neither let it be
[15:20] afraid he goes on to say in John 16:13
[15:24] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[15:28] come
[15:29] he will guide you teach
[15:32] you into all Truth for he shall not
[15:36] speak of
[15:37] himself but whatsoever he shall hear yes
[15:42] that shall he speak Hallelujah and he
[15:44] will show you things to
[15:48] come you know so as I was reading that
[15:51] verse in Psalm
[15:54] 144 which teacheth My Hands to War and
[15:57] my fingers to
[15:59] fight you know indeed he teaches us how
[16:03] fighting is
[16:05] done by
[16:07] abiding with the peace I leave with
[16:10] you by allowing him to teach us all
[16:16] things what he wants done with the word
[16:19] every
[16:20] day doing nothing until he shows us
[16:24] first am for without him we can do
[16:29] nothing peace on
[16:31] Earth good will his will toward men
[16:36] let's go ahead and stand this
[16:38] morning you know that final verse of
[16:40] Psalm 144 says this happy is that people
[16:45] that is in such a
[16:47] case yay happy is that people whose God
[16:52] is the
[16:53] Lord are you grateful for him this
[16:55] morning are you grateful for peace on
[16:57] Earth are you you're grateful that you
[16:59] don't have to know how to fight right
[17:01] you don't have to go out and do the
[17:03] fighting yeah we just have to abide and
[17:06] let him lead us and guide us as he would
[17:09] have us do and say let's go ahead and
[17:13] read Psalm 144 together blessed be the
[17:16] Lord my strength which teacheth My Hands
[17:19] to War and my fingers to fight my
[17:22] goodness and my Fortress my high tower
[17:25] and my deliverer my shield and he in
[17:28] whom I trust who subdueth my people
[17:31] under me Lord what is man that thou
[17:34] takest knowledge of him or the son of
[17:36] man that thou makest account of him man
[17:39] is like to vanity his days are as a
[17:41] shadow that passeth away bow thy Heavens
[17:45] oh Lord and come down touch the
[17:47] mountains and they shall smoke cast
[17:49] forth lightning and scatter them shoot
[17:52] out thine arrows and Destroy them send
[17:54] thine hand from above rid me and deliver
[17:57] me out of great water Waters from the
[17:59] hand of strange children whose mouth
[18:01] speaketh vanity and their right hand is
[18:04] a right hand of falsehood I will sing a
[18:06] new song unto thee Oh God upon a salt
[18:09] tree and an instrument of Ted and
[18:11] strings will I Sing Praises unto thee it
[18:14] is he that giveth salvation unto Kings
[18:17] Who delivereth David his servant from
[18:19] the hurtful sword rid me and Deliver Me
[18:22] from the hand of strange children whose
[18:24] mouth speaketh vanity and their right
[18:26] hand is a right hand of falsehood
[18:28] that our sons may be as plants grown up
[18:31] in their youth that our daughters may be
[18:33] as cornerstones polished after the
[18:35] similitude of a palace that our Garners
[18:38] may be full according all manner of
[18:40] store that our sheep may bring forth
[18:43] thousands and 10,000s in our streets

[54:41] how are you doing you good you're not
[54:44] going to stay up in them Hills forever
[54:46] are
[54:46] you I got to be honest you know
[54:53] um I I can't uh I can't for forget when
[54:59] I first uh
[55:04] uh
[55:06] Min um my brother he was standing in
[55:10] sitting in the back in our church and he
[55:12] was just shouting and carrying on and
[55:14] banging on the
[55:16] wall you know what I
[55:19] mean and
[55:21] uh I I said uh who is that crazy man
[55:26] come back there you know what I mean and
[55:29] I thought he'd just making a r Ruckus
[55:32] you know I won't embarrass him too bad
[55:35] but I I really come to love him and he's
[55:37] been a real friend of mine so it's nice
[55:39] to have him back with us this morning
[55:43] we're going to
[55:45] um listen to 30 minutes I wanted to play
[55:49] more but
[55:51] uh of why it had to be Shepherds
[55:55] and
[55:57] because we are here this morning because
[56:01] God sent a
[56:02] messenger we're not here because uh I
[56:06] have such a wonderful personality and
[56:09] I'm such a great preacher that I just
[56:12] gathered people together or we were with
[56:15] organizers we're here and we're together
[56:18] because of one thing is that we heard a
[56:22] voice we heard we heard a message go out
[56:26] in this day that God raised up and
[56:30] Vindicated a
[56:32] prophet and that Prophet came on the
[56:35] scene and he began to preach things that
[56:39] men had never heard before and once
[56:43] again to the Gentile
[56:46] church it was spoken in the days of
[56:50] Israel there was a man that came on the
[56:53] scene and they said never has a man
[56:56] spoke like this man and the Gentiles in
[57:00] this day were able to say the same thing
[57:02] never has there been a man that spoke
[57:05] like this
[57:07] man never was a man that could see what
[57:11] was hid and bring the hidden things of
[57:16] Darkness to the surface oh you scribes
[57:19] and you Pharisees he would say you know
[57:22] you doers of iniquity uh you do you know
[57:27] worship the slicers of your fathers wash
[57:30] them out nobody spoke like he spoke and
[57:32] nobody spoken this day because it was
[57:35] the pure unadulterated word of God and
[57:38] we've gathered because of that that is
[57:42] the reason that we purpose in our heart
[57:46] to go forward that's the reason that we
[57:49] try to make more space so more people
[57:53] can come in here not not that we can
[57:55] have a greater fellowship or that we can
[57:58] have a greater social structure or that
[58:01] we can have programs and things like
[58:03] that we've assembled this morning for
[58:06] one purpose and one purpose only is to
[58:09] hear the voice and to let that voice
[58:12] lead us and guide
[58:14] us in all truth and righteousness for it
[58:18] is the guide in this
[58:21] hour you might not say what lies ahead
[58:25] for tomorrow but we know who knows what
[58:28] lies ahead and we know that he knows
[58:31] what we have need of and so this
[58:36] morning uh I wanted to play and I wanted
[58:40] to listen to our messenger together
[58:43] because I never want us to lose the fact
[58:47] that that's our
[58:48] preeminence you know a lot of people
[58:51] feel that the spirit's moving on and
[58:53] God's moved on and now God's leading Us
[58:58] by the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit
[59:01] leads us by the word of
[59:04] God and and and uh that's what we go for
[59:08] I just noticed the Sanders here I think
[59:10] I bless you guys amen so nice to
[59:14] have everybody with us morning our
[59:16] visitors from love it God bless
[59:18] everybody and so that's the only way
[59:23] that we we have an answer is by the word
[59:28] a lot of people say well by the
[59:32] Bible you can give a thousand men this
[59:36] Bible right and you'll end up with a
[59:39] thousand different ideas you can give a
[59:42] thousand men a math book and they'll all
[59:45] be in the same
[59:47] mind because this isn't built on the
[59:50] letter it's built on divine revelation
[59:54] those whom God has chosen to
[59:58] reveal amen and this great messenger
[1:00:01] this great promise of Malachi 4:5 Luke
[1:00:05] 17:30 and Revelation 10:7 lied right in
[1:00:09] this book John 14 and
[1:00:12] Hebrews all lied right in this book but
[1:00:16] it was hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:00:19] prudent and revealed unto babes such
[1:00:22] would learn and by God's grace and mercy
[1:00:27] he opened your eyes and he gave you I
[1:00:30] have that you might see and if your
[1:00:32] vision begins to get dim you know look
[1:00:36] up your Redemption dos now so for our
[1:00:40] scripture reading this morning uh we're
[1:00:42] going to let the messenger of the hour
[1:00:46] uh read our our scripture reading to us
[1:00:50] this morning and uh so as he begins to
[1:00:54] read the scripture this morning you can
[1:00:57] stand I'll tell you where he's going to
[1:00:59] read from so you can uh prepare in your
[1:01:03] scriptures he's going to read from the
[1:01:05] second chapter of the Book of Luke and
[1:01:10] and we will stand as he begins to play
[1:01:12] that for us we're just going to play 30
[1:01:14] minutes I wanted to play 40 but I didn't
[1:01:17] want your message uh the message to get
[1:01:20] too long this morning we don't have
[1:01:22] service this evening so uh feel free so
[1:01:25] let's stand together as we prepare to
[1:01:27] listen to our messenger it's just
[1:01:30] raining outside you don't want to go out
[1:01:32] in the rain so we're just going to stay
[1:01:34] in here and uh a fellowship this morning
[1:01:40] around the word of God I sure enjoyed
[1:01:42] all the specialist this morning and all
[1:01:44] the singing and and and the love of the
[1:01:48] Lord so we love you this morning with
[1:01:51] all our hearts we love this message this
[1:01:55] morning and within it is everything that
[1:01:59] we have need of God bless you this
[1:02:01] morning as we listen to the message of
[1:02:05] the hour brought To Us by God's Prophet
[1:02:08] William
[1:02:10] brandham if you will turn with me for a
[1:02:13] reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2
[1:02:18] chapter can you hear me all right is
[1:02:21] there any transposition in the
[1:02:23] microphones can you hear in the back all
[1:02:25] right if you can raise your hand thank
[1:02:26] you the second chapter of The Gospel
[1:02:29] According to St Luke and it came to pass
[1:02:33] in those days that there went out a
[1:02:35] decree from Caesar austa that all the
[1:02:38] world should be
[1:02:41] taxed and this tax was first made known
[1:02:46] was governor of Syria and all went to be
[1:02:49] taxed every one to his own country and
[1:02:52] Joseph also went up From Galilee into
[1:02:55] the city of Nazareth into Judea the city
[1:02:59] of David which is called Bethlehem
[1:03:02] because he was of the house and lineage
[1:03:06] of David to be taxed with Mary his
[1:03:09] spouse wife being great with
[1:03:12] child and so it was that while she was
[1:03:16] there the days of her accomplishment
[1:03:19] that she should be delivered and she
[1:03:22] brought forth her firstborn son and
[1:03:24] wrapped him in swaddling clothes and
[1:03:27] laid him in the manger because there was
[1:03:30] no room for them in the end and there
[1:03:34] was in the same country Shepherd abiding
[1:03:38] in the fields keeping watch over their
[1:03:41] flocks By Night Lo the angel of the Lord
[1:03:45] Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord
[1:03:48] Shone around about them and they were
[1:03:51] sore
[1:03:53] afraid
[1:03:54] and the angels said unto them fear not
[1:03:58] for behold I bring Good Tidings of great
[1:04:02] joy which shall be to all people for
[1:04:07] unto you is Born This Day in the city of
[1:04:10] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[1:04:14] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[1:04:17] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:04:19] clothes laying in a manger and S L there
[1:04:25] was yeah and suddenly there with the
[1:04:29] angel a multitude of heavenly hosts
[1:04:32] praising God and saying glory to God in
[1:04:35] the highest and on Earth peace good well
[1:04:37] toward man and it came to pass as the
[1:04:42] Angels were gone away from them into
[1:04:44] heaven the Shepherds said one to another
[1:04:48] let us go now even unto Bethlehem and
[1:04:50] see this thing which has come to pass
[1:04:53] which the Lord has made known unto
[1:04:56] us and they came in haste and found Mary
[1:05:00] and Joseph and the Babe lying in the
[1:05:02] manger and when they had seen it they
[1:05:06] made on abroad the saying which was told
[1:05:09] them concerning the child and all they
[1:05:12] that heard it wondered at those things
[1:05:15] which were told them by the
[1:05:18] Shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[1:05:21] and pounded them in her heart
[1:05:25] and the Shepherds returned glorifying
[1:05:27] and praising God for all the things
[1:05:30] which they had heard and seen as it was
[1:05:34] told unto
[1:05:36] them may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:05:40] the reading of his
[1:05:41] word
[1:05:44] now it's uh
[1:05:47] why this great
[1:05:49] event was revealed to
[1:05:52] Shepherds that would be kind of an
[1:05:55] astounding thing for us I have some
[1:05:58] scriptures written here and a few notes
[1:06:00] that I will try to run over to explain
[1:06:02] to you why to the best of my
[1:06:05] knowledge and maybe then after this that
[1:06:08] the Lord with his grace tonight will
[1:06:10] take the wise away from us but did most
[1:06:14] all of us I suppose at one time or other
[1:06:18] has wondered why that this greatest
[1:06:21] event of all times
[1:06:24] was revealed to
[1:06:27] Shepherds why was it revealed to
[1:06:30] Shepherds and not to the theologians of
[1:06:33] that
[1:06:34] day they were the one were trained to
[1:06:36] hear it and why did it
[1:06:40] come and bypass the rich and come to the
[1:06:47] poor also why did it bypass the learned
[1:06:54] and wise and come to the humble and
[1:07:00] unlearned there is a few questions of
[1:07:02] why in this and another reason I might
[1:07:06] say notice the babe was born in
[1:07:10] Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew
[1:07:14] interpretation as we had a couple years
[1:07:17] ago here Bethlehem means the house of
[1:07:21] God's bread and we proved in the
[1:07:23] scriptures he could not come any other
[1:07:26] place Bethlehem was founded by Rahab and
[1:07:31] her uh her husband Rahab was a harlot
[1:07:34] that a general courted from the the uh
[1:07:37] Israelite Army after they had taken uh
[1:07:40] Jericho and by faith she believed the
[1:07:44] message of God in her condition and she
[1:07:46] was
[1:07:47] saved and from there when Joshua divided
[1:07:52] up the lands of of where each one would
[1:07:55] be and there's a great lesson that
[1:07:57] sometime I hope to be able to bring at
[1:07:59] Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving
[1:08:02] birth to those babies when she groaned
[1:08:05] at the birth pain of the baby she called
[1:08:08] the name of the baby and that
[1:08:10] positionally placed it in the promised
[1:08:13] land its tribe a great thing all the
[1:08:16] word of God fits right together if it
[1:08:19] doesn't fit together it's not God's word
[1:08:21] is Misfit it's your thought is
[1:08:23] misfitting to the word it all fits
[1:08:26] together so then he was the bread of
[1:08:29] life as we taught last week in phix or
[1:08:32] week before last and being the bread of
[1:08:35] life he could come no place else but the
[1:08:37] house of God's
[1:08:38] bread and that was the why now here
[1:08:42] Jesus is born in
[1:08:44] Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was
[1:08:49] synagogue great religious leaders lived
[1:08:52] in Bethlehem
[1:08:54] David the great king shepherd was born
[1:08:59] in
[1:09:00] Bethlehem his father chess was born in
[1:09:04] Bethlehem his grandfather oit was born
[1:09:07] in
[1:09:09] Bethlehem also all the way back he came
[1:09:13] from
[1:09:15] Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of
[1:09:18] David is born in Bethlehem right under
[1:09:22] the shadows of the great
[1:09:27] Cathedrals then if those people are
[1:09:30] trained and have been looking for the
[1:09:32] Messiah for all these years 4,000 years
[1:09:37] the Messiah had been prophesied to
[1:09:40] come and then if the Messiah be born in
[1:09:44] the shadow of the cathedral why did they
[1:09:47] have to go PL back up into the mountains
[1:09:49] to a bunch of unlearned untrained
[1:09:52] Shepherds Amen to
[1:09:56] bring the great message the first
[1:10:00] message and commission
[1:10:03] Shepherds not the wise and trained but
[1:10:07] Shepherds it's a strange thing isn't it
[1:10:11] well there's got to be a why somewhere
[1:10:14] there is a why now there's got to be an
[1:10:16] answer
[1:10:18] why and no man knows the answer save God
[1:10:22] he's the one that knows the answer now
[1:10:25] remember the Messiah was already in the
[1:10:28] city born in the city in a stable right
[1:10:32] by the great Cathedrals where the high
[1:10:35] priest and the great priest and the
[1:10:37] theologians and the wise and the trained
[1:10:40] all was there waiting for the
[1:10:44] Messiah and there he was right in their
[1:10:50] midst but why then did did they go to
[1:10:54] the out on the hills of Judea to
[1:10:59] unlearned
[1:11:01] untrained
[1:11:04] uncultured poorest of
[1:11:07] all look like the most unfit person for
[1:11:12] such a task to reveal the message and
[1:11:15] send them out to bring the
[1:11:19] message you know my opinion it might not
[1:11:23] amount to very much but I want to pass
[1:11:26] my
[1:11:28] opinion I believe it's because of the
[1:11:30] wisdom of
[1:11:31] God that he knew they wouldn't receive
[1:11:34] such a message the way it
[1:11:37] come it wasn't in the taste of their
[1:11:41] learning it was
[1:11:43] different it wasn't what they had been
[1:11:47] trained to believe he would be
[1:11:50] like it was contrary to their
[1:11:54] theological
[1:11:56] understanding all their
[1:11:59] training all their learning was
[1:12:03] bypassed become
[1:12:05] not I believe it was the wisdom of God
[1:12:08] that knew that they wouldn't receive
[1:12:10] such a
[1:12:11] message so the Messiah was here and
[1:12:15] there must be somebody recogniz it and
[1:12:19] he knew those who hadn't been mixed up
[1:12:22] and such stuff as that he would be more
[1:12:24] able to get his message to an unlearned
[1:12:27] group than he would be to a mixed up
[1:12:30] group that was so set in their ways that
[1:12:33] nothing could turn them not even the
[1:12:35] word of
[1:12:38] God and now Christian friends let me ask
[1:12:42] this
[1:12:44] question With all sincerity and love I
[1:12:48] just wonder if he would make the same
[1:12:52] act tonight
[1:12:53] and send to us in this
[1:12:57] generation the promised word that's
[1:13:00] promised for this generation I wonder if
[1:13:03] our theologians and Educators and wise
[1:13:07] wouldn't turn the message down just the
[1:13:09] same as they did that man doesn't
[1:13:13] change neither does God's word
[1:13:16] change he's the unchanging
[1:13:20] God he doesn't
[1:13:22] change
[1:13:25] notice Angels coming
[1:13:29] and Angels coming and giving their
[1:13:32] message to man of such low a
[1:13:37] state when there were men they're much
[1:13:40] more Earthly thought of qualified than
[1:13:44] these poor illiterate
[1:13:49] Shepherds the shepherd was the most
[1:13:51] illiterate of anybody
[1:13:53] he didn't need to know nothing but just
[1:13:55] about his sheep he didn't need to know
[1:13:59] mathematics he didn't need to know how
[1:14:02] to to split an
[1:14:04] atom he didn't need no
[1:14:07] scholarship he just had to know his
[1:14:10] sheep that's all that he needed to
[1:14:14] know and God the great wisdom and the
[1:14:18] fountain and resource of our
[1:14:21] wisdom would choose such a person as
[1:14:25] that persons rather as that and bypass
[1:14:29] all the wellt Tred Scholars that's
[1:14:32] trained to know
[1:14:34] that it speaks one thing that they were
[1:14:38] trained in the wrong
[1:14:40] field passing up all the important of
[1:14:43] the land that were important people
[1:14:46] great
[1:14:47] teachers to Ephesus the high priest many
[1:14:51] other great men all Israel's Mighty
[1:14:54] learned all the denominations and all
[1:14:57] the boasting theologians God bypassed
[1:15:00] every one of
[1:15:01] them uh that's God's
[1:15:05] wisdom notice the highest
[1:15:09] Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most
[1:15:14] humble and
[1:15:16] unlearned the highest of
[1:15:19] Heavens came down to make himself known
[1:15:23] to the lowest of the
[1:15:25] earth bypassing all
[1:15:28] between to make yourself known the
[1:15:31] common
[1:15:34] herdsmen coming to give these common
[1:15:36] herdsmen the greatest message Of All
[1:15:40] Times there had been many great
[1:15:43] Messengers we' think of the Noah's day
[1:15:46] and the prophets and and the great
[1:15:48] priest and so forth it been in the Days
[1:15:50] Gone By the Great learned man Kings
[1:15:52] potent
[1:15:54] monarchs but here he comes with the
[1:15:56] greatest of all the
[1:15:58] messages what was the message Messiah is
[1:16:01] here
[1:16:02] now and to make that known he bypassed
[1:16:06] all the train to make it known to Humble
[1:16:10] Shepherds think of it all of the
[1:16:13] clergymen all of the churchmen all of
[1:16:15] the teachers all of the the theological
[1:16:19] training all the money had been spent
[1:16:22] all the churches and the doctrines and
[1:16:24] the denominations is all
[1:16:26] byass all the learning that they had
[1:16:29] spent on all the all the missionaries
[1:16:31] and all the priting all the membership
[1:16:34] and everything that they had thought
[1:16:35] they had done honor to God yet the key
[1:16:38] message of all of it was bypassed from
[1:16:40] him strange
[1:16:44] why and notice not only that but the
[1:16:48] most unlikely place for such an
[1:16:51] event the the Shepherds now was the one
[1:16:56] who received the message and now notice
[1:16:59] where the message was in the most
[1:17:04] unlikely place that anyone would expect
[1:17:07] it to
[1:17:08] come and I wonder tonight if we were
[1:17:12] looking for the true message of the Lord
[1:17:16] Jesus I wonder if it would be in an
[1:17:18] unlikely
[1:17:19] group a place that was that the great uh
[1:17:24] High cultured world in the church today
[1:17:27] would think was a bunch
[1:17:29] of
[1:17:31] of oh
[1:17:34] Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be
[1:17:37] where we'd find
[1:17:38] him the most unlikely place and to the
[1:17:43] most unqualified
[1:17:46] speakers Shepherds know nothing about
[1:17:48] speaking only calling
[1:17:50] sheep but maybe that's why it comes
[1:17:55] but it was a promised
[1:17:57] word notice it could do that again it
[1:18:02] bypassed all the Nobles of the
[1:18:05] land it bypassed all the Nobles and was
[1:18:09] revealed to the no
[1:18:11] bodies all the Nobles that were
[1:18:14] decorated with with great doctors
[1:18:16] Divinity and and psychology and and
[1:18:20] highly uh education and great Cathedrals
[1:18:24] and things it was all bypassed and
[1:18:27] revealed to no
[1:18:30] bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of
[1:18:34] almighty God did
[1:18:37] it to make know one to them the greatest
[1:18:40] message ever was the Messiah is now on
[1:18:44] Earth what a wisdom can only come from
[1:18:48] God who knows
[1:18:49] wisdom all the wisdom and all all the
[1:18:54] schooling and everything was now laid to
[1:18:57] waste and bypassed by the great wisdom
[1:19:00] of
[1:19:01] God I keep repeating that because I want
[1:19:05] it to go down
[1:19:07] deep all laid the waste it was of no
[1:19:10] good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom
[1:19:14] have the right away that God takes the
[1:19:19] nothing to make the
[1:19:21] something
[1:19:24] we could stop here and speak of John we
[1:19:26] could stop and speak of Elijah nobody
[1:19:29] knows where Elijah come from all you
[1:19:31] know he just appeared on the scene the
[1:19:33] prophets back through the ages they were
[1:19:37] nobody but God took that and
[1:19:41] bypass the the ethics of the
[1:19:45] church and the teachings to make sure
[1:19:48] that he is God he takes something that's
[1:19:51] nothing to do something with
[1:19:56] it he shows his wisdom and his godhead
[1:20:00] by doing so that he takes the nothings
[1:20:04] when he first made a man he just took a
[1:20:05] ball of clay and made a man out of it
[1:20:08] where was nothing but clay but he made a
[1:20:10] man God takes the nothing's now to do
[1:20:13] the something's
[1:20:15] with and as long as we think we're
[1:20:17] somethings and we cannot be used in the
[1:20:19] hand of God we must forsake all we ever
[1:20:23] knew or learned pardon me like the great
[1:20:26] St Paul he said he had forget all he
[1:20:29] ever learned that he might know
[1:20:32] Christ all their
[1:20:34] schooling all their teachings and so
[1:20:37] forth was working out to the worst for
[1:20:41] them it finally denied him the very
[1:20:45] schooling that they had had far him to
[1:20:47] believe him turned around and become his
[1:20:50] most critical enemy and crucified
[1:20:54] him do you know that history repeats
[1:20:58] itself ever so
[1:21:01] often it's a noted fact it could happen
[1:21:06] again right by the side of us or you
[1:21:09] said if I live then well now if you want
[1:21:12] to know what you'd have done then look
[1:21:14] at your present State now and you can
[1:21:17] see what you'd have done then because it
[1:21:19] certainly is
[1:21:21] revealing
[1:21:24] train to believe his word and then when
[1:21:27] his word was Vindicated before their
[1:21:30] very eyes they denied the word that was
[1:21:32] made
[1:21:34] Vindication when God proved what he
[1:21:36] would do and said what he would do and
[1:21:39] prove what he would do then they turned
[1:21:42] around and called this man an evil
[1:21:44] spirit which cursed them
[1:21:49] all think of what taken place
[1:21:53] think of what caused them their training
[1:21:56] caused them not to recognize the very
[1:22:01] word made flesh for their day the very
[1:22:05] training that they had in their schools
[1:22:08] with the very best of
[1:22:10] teachers and you say well we wouldn't do
[1:22:13] that today their teachers were far
[1:22:15] Supreme to ours today Superior to our
[1:22:21] teachers and they failed they didn't
[1:22:24] have
[1:22:25] 996 different organizations as we have
[1:22:29] today they had about three and in the
[1:22:32] Three Bottle down to three and none of
[1:22:35] the three recognized
[1:22:38] it this goes to show that What man does
[1:22:41] is foolishness to
[1:22:43] God
[1:22:45] now they failed to recognize it now and
[1:22:50] they do the same thing again
[1:22:53] man intention is good and always is good
[1:22:57] and man never changes his posture he
[1:23:02] never changes his ways much I'm talking
[1:23:06] to the man of the world man is always
[1:23:09] praising God religious man for what he
[1:23:13] done and always pointing people to what
[1:23:16] he's going to do and then ignoring what
[1:23:19] he's doing see that's just man
[1:23:23] he's made that way he's always been that
[1:23:26] way and you Bible readers tonight know
[1:23:28] that that's according to the word right
[1:23:31] they're always praising God for what he
[1:23:33] has done saying what he will do and
[1:23:36] ignoring what he's doing that's just the
[1:23:38] habit of
[1:23:42] man the reason that they had did this
[1:23:45] the
[1:23:46] teachers to my opinion now they had
[1:23:49] interpreted the word c a all believed in
[1:23:53] a coming Messiah all Israel believed it
[1:23:57] they do yet
[1:23:58] today but the reason that they didn't
[1:24:02] recognize
[1:24:03] him his message wasn't according to
[1:24:07] their
[1:24:09] ecclesiastical
[1:24:11] fit they uh there the interpretation
[1:24:14] that they had of the word the Messiah
[1:24:17] never manifested himself in the way that
[1:24:20] they had interpreted that he would do it
[1:24:23] so and therefore they did not recognize
[1:24:26] him because it didn't fit their
[1:24:29] interpretation as I've said before and
[1:24:32] say again God doesn't need anybody to
[1:24:35] interpret his word he is his own
[1:24:39] interpreter now the Bible says let me
[1:24:42] prove to you now that that is the truth
[1:24:46] Isaiah the prophet 715 years before this
[1:24:49] happened Isaiah the prophet said a
[1:24:52] virgin shall conceive and shall bear a
[1:24:55] child there's no doubt that everyone in
[1:24:58] that age thought their daughter would be
[1:25:00] that woman because Isaiah said it but
[1:25:03] you see it was 700 years
[1:25:06] later but when God didn't need anybody
[1:25:10] to interpret his word when he'll do it
[1:25:11] or how he would do it he said he would
[1:25:13] do it and he did
[1:25:16] it God promised that he over in Isaiah
[1:25:20] also of believe the 28th chapter about
[1:25:22] the 18th verse and also in Joel 228 that
[1:25:26] in the last days the last 2,000 years he
[1:25:29] had pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh
[1:25:32] he said your sons and daughters shall
[1:25:34] prophesy your young man shall see
[1:25:36] Visions your old man shall dream dreams
[1:25:39] and the things that he would do Isaiah
[1:25:42] said with stammering lips and other
[1:25:44] tongues will I speak to this people and
[1:25:46] this is the rest but they wouldn't hear
[1:25:49] it they Wagg their heads and walked by
[1:25:50] it he said all the tables of God would
[1:25:54] become full of vomit and there would be
[1:25:56] nothing clean and if that isn't a
[1:25:59] picture of Jerusalem and the Church of
[1:26:02] that day at the coming Messiah it's a
[1:26:04] picture today the
[1:26:06] same it's just repeating itself now when
[1:26:11] God says he'll do a thing he did it
[1:26:13] regardless of what anybody else thinks
[1:26:15] about it what anybody says when God
[1:26:17] speaks to something he's Duty bound to
[1:26:19] interpret that word himself and his in
[1:26:22] the Vindication of the word is his own
[1:26:25] interpretation
[1:26:27] notice vindicating his messiah's
[1:26:30] message he promised what the Messiah
[1:26:33] would do when he come and when he came
[1:26:36] even when the wise man in the East had
[1:26:39] looked down south Westward from where
[1:26:42] they were at in Babylon and they saw a
[1:26:45] majestic
[1:26:47] star did you know there's not a speck of
[1:26:50] History nowhere that any Observatory
[1:26:53] where they even kept the the uh the time
[1:26:56] by stars great man who studied these
[1:27:00] Stars there's not no history says that
[1:27:02] any of them seen that star at all why it
[1:27:06] wasn't given to them they wasn't looking
[1:27:09] for such but these wise men know that
[1:27:12] there would be a star of Jacob
[1:27:15] right and they were looking for it and
[1:27:18] it passed from the time that Jesus was
[1:27:22] born in Bethlehem now I know our
[1:27:25] Christian Traditions it's just like our
[1:27:28] churches it has things Topsy turby you
[1:27:31] go out here and you see wise men coming
[1:27:32] to worship a baby there's not such a
[1:27:35] thing in the scripture two years later
[1:27:37] they got there coming down through the
[1:27:39] Plains and across the Tigers River they
[1:27:41] never come to worship an infant but a
[1:27:43] young
[1:27:44] child about 2 years old why was it at
[1:27:47] the same time Herod slew all the
[1:27:49] children from two years old under that
[1:27:52] that he might catch the Messiah you see
[1:27:55] they God had Vindicated by his word and
[1:27:58] when these wise men came to Jerusalem
[1:28:01] the star LED them to the religious
[1:28:03] capital of the world Jerusalem and as
[1:28:07] soon as they entered those Gates that
[1:28:09] star the supernatural that had led them
[1:28:12] refused to show them anymore up and down
[1:28:14] the streets These Fine Man rich man with
[1:28:18] find great camels and so forth up and
[1:28:20] down the streets and worried this born
[1:28:22] King of the Jews we saw his star in the
[1:28:24] east and that great religious
[1:28:28] Capal after two years of the shepherd's
[1:28:32] message still didn't have the answer and
[1:28:34] know nothing about
[1:28:36] it the head of all the denominations
[1:28:39] amen didn't have the answer so it
[1:28:43] Disturbed the Sanhedrin and they called
[1:28:45] for the scribes to come read and they
[1:28:48] read Micah story The Prophet which said
[1:28:51] that th Bethlehem art thou not the least
[1:28:54] of all the princes of Judah the least
[1:28:57] but out of thee shall come a governor
[1:29:00] that shall rule My People
[1:29:03] Israel and after the scriptures being
[1:29:05] read and still being Vindicated Before
[1:29:08] Their Eyes they still didn't accept it
[1:29:13] though the scripture said
[1:29:15] so I doubt very much they would today if
[1:29:19] the scriptures that's promised for this
[1:29:21] day would be made
[1:29:23] manifest I may never preach to you again
[1:29:26] but I want you to get
[1:29:28] this still they wouldn't
[1:29:31] believe the great wisdom of the father
[1:29:34] makes man's Wisdom so
[1:29:37] foolish that he belittles the man he
[1:29:41] actually comes to the place the work
[1:29:43] makes man feel so ashamed of himself and
[1:29:46] he's not big enough to admit that he's
[1:29:50] wrong he's still stays with this story
[1:29:54] no matter how much the father proves
[1:29:56] that his word is true and he's doing
[1:29:59] just what he promised to do man thinks
[1:30:02] his wisdom is so Superior to God if it
[1:30:04] don't come according to his wisdom why
[1:30:07] It Isn't So Am that's true in every age
[1:30:10] still does it see how fitting the whole
[1:30:14] matter was now what inspiration to those
[1:30:19] herdsmen the Angels come coming down to
[1:30:22] speak to
[1:30:24] herdsmen angels of God coming to speak
[1:30:27] to a bunch of shepherds I wonder if you
[1:30:31] ever had the privilege of of talking
[1:30:35] with a Shepherd or being with one a
[1:30:38] while if you would I I don't like to say
[1:30:41] it because of my uh remark I'm fixing to
[1:30:45] say after a while but the shepherd stays
[1:30:48] with the Sheep so
[1:30:50] much until he even laughs like the Sheep
[1:30:56] blatant he talks like the
[1:30:59] sheep and he smells like the
[1:31:02] Sheep that's
[1:31:06] right because he's with the Sheep that's
[1:31:10] all he knows is his
[1:31:14] sheep now the Vindicated word of Truth
[1:31:19] when these Shepherds humble
[1:31:23] uneducated man what an honor how fitting
[1:31:29] it is to a
[1:31:30] Shepherd to receive a message of a
[1:31:34] newborn
[1:31:38] sheep it could come to nothing else but
[1:31:41] a
[1:31:41] Shepherd that's why he was born in a
[1:31:44] stable and not in a house sheep were not
[1:31:47] born in a house or in a pink decorated
[1:31:50] hospital room see they are born in the
[1:31:54] barn in the
[1:31:56] fields that's the reason he was led to
[1:32:00] Calvary you can't not make a sheep walk
[1:32:02] the G way to the slaughter did you know
[1:32:06] that in the slaughter yards they have a
[1:32:08] goat that leads the sheep and when he
[1:32:11] gets up to where the killing place is he
[1:32:14] jumps out and lets the Sheep go on a
[1:32:17] sheep has to be led he can't lead
[1:32:19] himself so therefore
[1:32:22] it had to be the shepherd coming for the
[1:32:25] his sheep when they found the god baby
[1:32:29] exactly where the messenger said he
[1:32:32] would be and when they found
[1:32:35] this mess message of the messenger in
[1:32:40] the manger
[1:32:42] exactly where the angel said it would
[1:32:47] be now you'll just have to go home and
[1:32:50] listen to the tape you're
[1:32:52] s
[1:33:00] amen this is this message is
[1:33:03] tremendous and the farther you get into
[1:33:05] it the greater it is but I'd just like
[1:33:08] to take a little Christmas thought from
[1:33:11] that if
[1:33:13] uh you wouldn't mind and and uh uh hope
[1:33:19] that uh you heard enough that you
[1:33:24] understand that what I'm saying has a
[1:33:27] source and uh I've always tried to do
[1:33:30] that for you to let you know that uh the
[1:33:34] thinking is I don't want it to be my
[1:33:37] thinking I want it to be motivated from
[1:33:39] the word of God and and so my you know
[1:33:43] this is this is Christmas and we know
[1:33:48] that uh because of uh Christmas and uh
[1:33:54] there's a lot of
[1:33:56] giftgiving going on and uh a lot of uh
[1:34:02] uh trying to find the right gift and and
[1:34:06] of course you know now is a technical
[1:34:08] age and time and uh you can get gifts
[1:34:12] you can't even figure
[1:34:14] out you know know what button to press
[1:34:17] and and all this and everything has
[1:34:21] become
[1:34:22] uh more and more Superior more and more
[1:34:26] technical uh it was just David's uh
[1:34:30] birthday here uh uh and uh he had his
[1:34:35] birthday and in uh one of his brothers
[1:34:38] gave him a pepper
[1:34:42] grinder and I mean this ain't no just
[1:34:45] pepper grinder man this thing is a
[1:34:48] pepper
[1:34:49] grinder and I didn't even know a pepper
[1:34:51] grinder could get you know so technical
[1:34:56] you know what I mean and they figured
[1:34:58] out just how to let the grind the pepper
[1:35:00] just so perfect and everything in fact I
[1:35:03] was sitting 50 feet away from them and
[1:35:05] that pepper was ground so perfect I
[1:35:07] began to
[1:35:10] sneeze so there's a lot of emphasis at
[1:35:13] this time of year on gifts and and
[1:35:18] understanding
[1:35:20] gifts and I think that uh we received a
[1:35:25] gift we all know that the greatest gift
[1:35:28] that was ever given to this world was
[1:35:31] the Lord Jesus but I don't think a lot
[1:35:34] of times that we understand the
[1:35:38] gift and we don't even understand the
[1:35:43] message amen and and I thought the
[1:35:46] prophet of God that brought that out so
[1:35:48] beautiful he said the message that the
[1:35:50] angels brought the shepherd was that the
[1:35:54] Messiah is on earth now
[1:35:59] amen he's here now he said it's so in
[1:36:03] the same day today the message hasn't
[1:36:06] changed the Messiah is here now he's
[1:36:10] here now he's not a far off he's not
[1:36:13] gone someplace he's the same yesterday
[1:36:16] today and forever and he's here
[1:36:19] now but I don't think we understand
[1:36:21] understand all that the Lord brought us
[1:36:24] and I can't preach the whole gospel in
[1:36:26] just a few minutes but I just want to
[1:36:28] bring this to us this morning I don't
[1:36:32] really sometimes really think that we
[1:36:36] understand what this great gift is to us
[1:36:41] and I thought as the prophet of God
[1:36:42] begin to
[1:36:45] unfold uh uh this to us and I I'd like
[1:36:50] to say this about the gift this
[1:36:55] morning so many times our gifts are all
[1:36:59] we always relate it
[1:37:02] carnally you know uh I get the question
[1:37:06] asked to me what do you want for
[1:37:09] Christmas well I don't even want
[1:37:11] Christmas so uh you know what are you
[1:37:14] going to do about a gift you know I
[1:37:16] don't want no more
[1:37:18] stuff you know I I finally had to I
[1:37:21] guess the only thing I need is a pair of
[1:37:24] of slacks that the uh belt goes in and
[1:37:27] out you know what I mean and uh and so
[1:37:31] you you you you recognize that none of
[1:37:36] those
[1:37:38] there you don't need stuff you you uh
[1:37:42] you know someone says what do you want
[1:37:44] for Christmas and I begin to realize
[1:37:47] that there's nothing that man can give
[1:37:50] that could really
[1:37:52] satisfy what it is that I
[1:37:55] want excuse
[1:37:58] me and so everything's always geared to
[1:38:04] carnality and if if it's just it's just
[1:38:07] he said that's the way that man is it's
[1:38:10] it it's carnal we even think of God too
[1:38:14] much in the carnal realm we measure God
[1:38:18] by by carnality it's always about what
[1:38:21] God can do for me what God what's my
[1:38:24] situation what's my circumstance oh you
[1:38:27] know we go so long in a certain
[1:38:29] direction until we get in a mess and
[1:38:31] then we need God you know we got to call
[1:38:33] on God and and and we always want God
[1:38:38] the result that God gives us we want a
[1:38:43] carnal
[1:38:44] result we want him to do something for
[1:38:47] our body we want him to do something for
[1:38:50] our circumstance we want him to do
[1:38:52] something for our finance we want to do
[1:38:56] something for the ease of life we're
[1:38:58] always asking for something carnal and
[1:39:02] I'd like to say this morning that's the
[1:39:04] problem with us is we're way too
[1:39:09] carnal we're just carnal everything gets
[1:39:12] measured by the
[1:39:14] Flesh and and so even when we look at
[1:39:18] Christmas and we look at the gift of God
[1:39:20] we we try to begin to measure in in
[1:39:24] carnality what did he do he saved me
[1:39:28] what did he do he gave me heaven you
[1:39:31] know if if we we start to relate
[1:39:34] everything back to a physical carnal
[1:39:41] State and do you know the carnal mind if
[1:39:45] says in Romans 8 7-9 the carnal mind is
[1:39:49] enity with God it's against
[1:39:57] God it it separates us from God and all
[1:40:02] the time we begin to measure the
[1:40:05] blessings of God we begin to say oh God
[1:40:08] bless me and if I would say to you uh
[1:40:11] what's your blessing uh we would get a
[1:40:14] carnal
[1:40:16] response God blessed me with a good job
[1:40:19] God blessed me with the truck God
[1:40:22] blessed me with health God blessed me
[1:40:24] with this God blessed me with that and
[1:40:27] every measure of God is
[1:40:35] carnal that's how we've
[1:40:39] become and I thought as our prophet of
[1:40:41] God brought this out and we'll just walk
[1:40:43] through it a little bit this morning
[1:40:45] with
[1:40:47] you the gift of God was not carnal
[1:40:54] the gift of God was
[1:40:59] spiritual it's the spiritual mind that's
[1:41:04] life and
[1:41:08] peace we look at these
[1:41:11] great gift of God this morning and I
[1:41:14] want to just say
[1:41:16] this that it might rest in our hearts
[1:41:20] this morning
[1:41:24] that the gift of God was not
[1:41:26] carnal it was
[1:41:30] spiritual and really what was
[1:41:33] it that God gave
[1:41:37] us if I would to ask
[1:41:42] you could you want to give something to
[1:41:45] somebody that they
[1:41:47] need you want to give something to
[1:41:49] somebody that
[1:41:51] helps you
[1:41:52] identify like if you're a fisherman or
[1:41:56] or or something you want to give them
[1:42:00] something because you know they're a
[1:42:03] fisherman you know what I mean I I I
[1:42:06] tried to take up the sport of uh golf
[1:42:10] for a little while haven't golfed in a
[1:42:13] long time but all I got was golf balls
[1:42:16] golf shirts golf
[1:42:18] teas uh divots
[1:42:21] fixures I never hit a green to make a
[1:42:23] divot anyway so uh that's all you know
[1:42:27] because everybody identified me as a
[1:42:29] golfer and I thought I don't want to be
[1:42:31] identified as a
[1:42:36] golfer so we really begin to think even
[1:42:39] our carnal our
[1:42:42] identification of one another as carnal
[1:42:45] that's right that's right that's right
[1:42:47] we we we we we measure uh people people
[1:42:51] in the carnal realm we couldn't tell if
[1:42:55] somebody was spiritual or
[1:42:59] not and I'm not cheing us out this
[1:43:02] morning amen but I want to bring us to a
[1:43:06] reality that we can get from a carnal
[1:43:09] place to a spiritual place that's the
[1:43:11] trouble with the church they're not
[1:43:14] spiritual
[1:43:18] enough their whole process is carnal
[1:43:22] their whole measurement of life is
[1:43:24] carnal their whole measurement of one
[1:43:26] another is
[1:43:30] carnal and and we want to rise above
[1:43:33] that we want to rise above measuring our
[1:43:37] church by the sizes of our building you
[1:43:39] know the prophet of God he just preached
[1:43:42] about that over and over and over again
[1:43:45] like it's some sort of monument and then
[1:43:48] we look right here at the scripture and
[1:43:50] God's wisdom made his Monument nothing
[1:43:54] that was carnal that's
[1:43:58] rightall why did it have to be in
[1:44:02] Bethlehem because he was a shepherd He
[1:44:05] was the Lamb of God and the Lamb of God
[1:44:08] had to be born like a
[1:44:10] lamb why did it have to be Shepherds
[1:44:13] because it was the Lamb of God the
[1:44:15] wisdom of
[1:44:17] God cuz Lambs come to the Shepherds
[1:44:22] everything about
[1:44:25] it wasn't carnal at
[1:44:29] all it was
[1:44:32] spiritual the spiritual was AB it was
[1:44:35] absolutely a
[1:44:37] spiritual
[1:44:39] word
[1:44:40] happening and even today we think oh
[1:44:43] he's born in no rooming me in it was
[1:44:46] carinal the poor little Mary and Joseph
[1:44:50] uh
[1:44:53] rejected but you you understand it it
[1:44:56] that's the carnal
[1:44:59] story that's a carinal
[1:45:03] Viewpoint him coming down the land the
[1:45:06] taxes and everything oh that's the
[1:45:08] carnal view but when you get back if we
[1:45:11] could put on spiritual glasses it was a
[1:45:14] spiritual event it had to be that way
[1:45:17] because God's wisdom God's
[1:45:21] magnificence Hallelujah in fulfilling
[1:45:24] the word of God and hiding it from the
[1:45:28] wise and prudent and revealing it unto
[1:45:32] babes such as would
[1:45:36] learn it's
[1:45:39] it's it behooves
[1:45:43] us to really understand what it means
[1:45:46] the washing of the water of the word of
[1:45:49] God it means to wash the carnality out
[1:45:52] of it
[1:45:54] am and and begin to
[1:45:59] to place in us as it says in Philippians
[1:46:04] 2 and 5-1 let this mind be in you that
[1:46:08] was in
[1:46:10] Christ and so I want to say really what
[1:46:13] this great gift
[1:46:18] was what really was was the gift that
[1:46:22] God was giving
[1:46:24] us and so that we don't miss
[1:46:29] it or if I could say this part of really
[1:46:32] what it
[1:46:33] was that God was bringing to
[1:46:38] us have we ever got a gift you say what
[1:46:41] is
[1:46:42] this what does this
[1:46:46] do and I think you just look at the uh
[1:46:51] uh Christmas you just look at things we
[1:46:54] always look at it just the way the
[1:46:57] prophet of God said it what did God give
[1:46:59] you he gave me eternal
[1:47:04] life one day I'll
[1:47:08] leave and then we look at it and said oh
[1:47:11] you know uh he Vindicated it and he did
[1:47:15] all these things and we're always
[1:47:17] looking
[1:47:18] back and we're always looking to the
[1:47:24] Future and sometimes we don't even
[1:47:28] understand what what he's doing
[1:47:33] now even in the even in the the message
[1:47:37] of the hour we look back upon brother
[1:47:40] brandom's message and we look to the
[1:47:43] Future uh of the the message but a lot
[1:47:46] of people and I just say this from my
[1:47:48] heart I hope I don't seem terrible but a
[1:47:51] lot of people don't even understand the
[1:47:53] message is still doing something for us
[1:47:59] now and are we even catching what it's
[1:48:03] doing for us
[1:48:07] now you can read the Bible like a
[1:48:09] history book and you can read the Bible
[1:48:13] like a book of Prophecy but oh if you're
[1:48:18] spiritual right the carinal mind can
[1:48:21] read the Bible that's right as a book of
[1:48:24] uh prophecy that's right the carinal
[1:48:26] mind can read the book as a book of
[1:48:29] history but it takes somebody to be in
[1:48:31] the spirit to have a spiritual mind to
[1:48:35] read the scriptures and let the
[1:48:37] scriptures speak to you in the
[1:48:43] now that's right to be living that's
[1:48:49] right so we look at what
[1:48:52] he's as our messenger so beautifully
[1:48:56] brought
[1:48:57] out and he said in this 18th uh
[1:49:01] paragraph he said and there was a great
[1:49:04] lesson that sometimes I hope to be able
[1:49:08] to bring at Tucson of those Hebrew
[1:49:12] mothers giving birth over those babies
[1:49:16] when she would grown at Birth pain of
[1:49:19] the baby and she would call out the name
[1:49:23] of the baby and that positionally placed
[1:49:27] it in the promised land its
[1:49:32] tribe it's a
[1:49:34] great the great thing all the word of
[1:49:38] God fits right
[1:49:40] together that's right now listen what he
[1:49:43] said as I try to just express to you
[1:49:46] what it is on my heart and and
[1:49:51] if I can say this and I I I I hope I
[1:49:54] don't seem out of place but it's what I
[1:49:57] desire for you this morning and I desire
[1:50:01] for
[1:50:02] myself he said if it doesn't fit
[1:50:06] together it's not God's
[1:50:09] word that's
[1:50:11] Misfit it's your thoughts is misfitting
[1:50:16] to the word of God it all fits together
[1:50:20] it was the
[1:50:22] thoughts that misplaced the word of God
[1:50:27] it was the thoughts that were misfitted
[1:50:32] and he goes on to explain over and over
[1:50:35] again it was their thinking that was
[1:50:39] misfitted
[1:50:41] did you see how he went through it
[1:50:44] bringing it out he
[1:50:46] said he
[1:50:48] said he he says in this place he
[1:50:51] said he said in this paragraph 31 he
[1:50:55] goes on to speak he said we can stop
[1:51:00] here and speak of John we could stop and
[1:51:03] speak of Elijah nobody knowed where
[1:51:05] Elija come
[1:51:07] from all they knew is he just appeared
[1:51:10] on the scene the prophets back through
[1:51:13] the ages they were
[1:51:16] nobody's but God took and bypassed the
[1:51:19] Hallelujah ethics of the church and the
[1:51:22] teachings to show that he's
[1:51:25] God he takes something that's nothing to
[1:51:28] do something with
[1:51:32] it he shows his
[1:51:36] wisdom and his godhead by doing
[1:51:41] so you understand
[1:51:44] this forces you right into the measuring
[1:51:51] of things by
[1:51:53] [Applause]
[1:51:58] spirituality not by
[1:52:01] personality not by
[1:52:04] education not by uh the the uh Speech
[1:52:11] and elegance as Paul said I didn't come
[1:52:14] to you with Elegance of
[1:52:18] speech but I came to you humble and
[1:52:23] meek in fear and in
[1:52:27] trembling so it would take it would have
[1:52:29] to take a spiritual mind to be able to
[1:52:33] look at Paul and see the spirit moving
[1:52:37] and not judge him by the
[1:52:42] carnal because of the way that he was
[1:52:47] and yet he had to to defend himself in
[1:52:51] one place because theyve become so
[1:52:54] carnal that's right me but measuring I'm
[1:52:57] of this person and I'm of that person he
[1:53:00] says I didn't even baptize any of you
[1:53:02] and then when he came in question he
[1:53:04] says look at yourselves aren't you the
[1:53:06] proof of my
[1:53:11] Ministry so the the it's the carnal
[1:53:17] mind that separates people
[1:53:21] it's the carinal mind that measures
[1:53:24] what's spiritual and what's not it's the
[1:53:26] carinal mind what measures what good
[1:53:29] preaching is and what good preaching
[1:53:31] isn't one of the greatest messages that
[1:53:34] ever was preached was preached by a
[1:53:44] mule so we're such
[1:53:48] victims of of our carnal mind just
[1:53:52] follow me if you would for the wisdom of
[1:53:54] this godhead that he takes nothing when
[1:53:58] he first made a man he just took a ball
[1:54:01] of
[1:54:02] clay and made a man out of
[1:54:06] it that's all we
[1:54:10] are we've only got big eyes and little
[1:54:13] use in the colal realm
[1:54:16] right we've only got rich and poor in
[1:54:19] the carnal realm we only measure
[1:54:23] blessings in the carnal
[1:54:27] realm and you know it's such a blessing
[1:54:30] we would feel somebody's blessing if
[1:54:32] they're outgoing and and and they've got
[1:54:35] Carisma and they've got a personality
[1:54:38] we'd say oh that person's blessed I'd
[1:54:40] like to be with them but yet really in
[1:54:42] the spiritual mind a Meek and humble
[1:54:45] Spirit
[1:54:47] Hall somebody that's willing to take the
[1:54:50] back seat somebody that's willing just
[1:54:53] to not get any uh recognition or
[1:54:57] anything
[1:54:59] Hallelujah
[1:55:02] right and and we couldn't even recognize
[1:55:07] but yet that's the crown of
[1:55:10] life it takes
[1:55:13] spirituality to see those
[1:55:18] things it takes spirituality do you
[1:55:20] understand there there's not a preacher
[1:55:23] in this message that has anything to
[1:55:27] say and if they say anything other than
[1:55:30] what the prophet said they're
[1:55:34] [Applause]
[1:55:39] lying that's right amen the very fact
[1:55:42] that we would measure
[1:55:44] Ministries shows how
[1:55:47] carnal that we be come amen follow with
[1:55:52] me if you don't mind me
[1:55:54] please he
[1:55:56] says and God takes nothing to do
[1:55:58] something with
[1:56:01] it he says as long as we think or
[1:56:06] something then we cannot be used in the
[1:56:10] hands of God we must forsake
[1:56:15] all we've ever known or learned
[1:56:20] like the great Paul said that he had to
[1:56:23] forget every learned that he might know
[1:56:29] Christ all their schooling and all their
[1:56:33] teaching and so forth was worked out for
[1:56:38] the worst for
[1:56:41] them he finally it finally denied
[1:56:46] him the very schooling that they had had
[1:56:50] for him to believe him turned around and
[1:56:55] became his most critical enemy and
[1:56:59] crucified him think of it
[1:57:02] now the very carnal mind that they were
[1:57:06] thinking of to learn more of them ended
[1:57:10] up turning against
[1:57:13] them you understand what he's saying
[1:57:16] your chiral mind will turn against you
[1:57:23] your caral
[1:57:25] discernment will turn against you your
[1:57:28] carnal judgments will turn against
[1:57:32] you and eventually it led them to
[1:57:36] crucify the word of God and the god of
[1:57:43] Glory because
[1:57:46] why they
[1:57:48] learned
[1:57:50] you know
[1:57:54] Satan teaches us to
[1:57:57] think yeah
[1:58:00] education
[1:58:02] science
[1:58:04] civilization is all
[1:58:06] carnal it was never
[1:58:10] meant for us to do anything
[1:58:14] by we're not led by
[1:58:17] education we're not LED by civilization
[1:58:21] or culture that's
[1:58:26] right we're not led by
[1:58:32] science we're
[1:58:34] led by the spirit of
[1:58:38] God so he said that it was what they
[1:58:43] learned and what they were
[1:58:48] taught what they thought they were
[1:58:50] learning and what they thought they were
[1:58:52] being taught was the very thing that
[1:58:55] came back and destroyed
[1:58:58] them and because their
[1:59:02] learning was
[1:59:05] wrong it actually caused them to crucify
[1:59:08] the very thing they were looking for
[1:59:10] what a tragic thing it was as Mike spoke
[1:59:13] a little bit this
[1:59:17] morning and he drops down and he says
[1:59:19] says this he says train to believe his
[1:59:23] word paragraph 34 he says train to
[1:59:26] believe his word and then when his word
[1:59:29] was Vindicated before their very eyes
[1:59:32] they denied the word that was
[1:59:35] made
[1:59:38] Vindicated when God proved what he would
[1:59:41] do and said what he would do and prove
[1:59:45] that he would do then they turned around
[1:59:49] and called The Man a evil
[1:59:51] spirit which cursed them
[1:59:55] all how many knows it did the whole city
[1:59:59] was destroyed
[2:00:02] right he said think of what taken place
[2:00:06] think of what caused them their training
[2:00:12] caused them not to recognize the very
[2:00:17] word made flesh for their day the very
[2:00:21] training that they had in their schools
[2:00:24] with the very best of
[2:00:29] teachers what do he what does he he
[2:00:33] keep expressing
[2:00:36] here they were taught to think a certain
[2:00:40] way they were taught how it would be
[2:00:44] amen they were taught how that it is and
[2:00:48] we find out all their teaching was
[2:00:53] carnal all their teaching was
[2:00:57] carnal what what they were what they
[2:00:59] were saying it was based on
[2:01:05] carnality he says and he says this is
[2:01:08] what they do I like what he says here
[2:01:10] the great wisdom of the father makes
[2:01:13] man's Wisdom so foolish paragraph
[2:01:17] 46 that he belittles the man he actually
[2:01:22] comes to the
[2:01:23] place to where it makes him feel so
[2:01:26] ashamed of himself and he's not big
[2:01:30] enough to admit that he's wrong he'll
[2:01:34] still stay with his story no matter how
[2:01:38] much the father proves that his word is
[2:01:42] true and he's going just what he
[2:01:45] promised to do man thinks his wisdom is
[2:01:49] so Superior to God if it don't come
[2:01:54] according to his wisdom why it isn't
[2:02:00] so that's true in every age still does
[2:02:04] it see how fitting the whole matter was
[2:02:10] now
[2:02:14] thank now listen what I I'm trying to
[2:02:17] say this morning
[2:02:22] I hope you know I love you man's
[2:02:26] Wisdom man thinks that his wisdom is so
[2:02:31] Superior to
[2:02:33] God that he'll stay with his
[2:02:39] story he'll stay with his story he'll
[2:02:43] stay with his thinking why it it it
[2:02:47] isn't so
[2:02:49] that that that he he's
[2:02:54] trained he's
[2:02:57] taught he's educated from
[2:03:00] birth he's raised to think this
[2:03:07] way he has in him
[2:03:10] amen something that is is uh inherent to
[2:03:17] him that he's been brought
[2:03:20] up and he's
[2:03:24] learned all of us are here today many
[2:03:27] different countries many different
[2:03:29] languages we all have so much we've
[2:03:31] learned so much that's been brought to
[2:03:34] us coming through life my father telling
[2:03:37] me the way things were and and how he
[2:03:40] would present politics to me and and and
[2:03:44] how is Viewpoint of things and I would
[2:03:47] sit there and I would listen and and and
[2:03:50] I would become my
[2:03:55] father I'd be like my
[2:03:59] dad in fact in my life I came to a place
[2:04:03] that I I didn't understand why I reacted
[2:04:06] the way I did why that what things
[2:04:08] bothered me and what things didn't
[2:04:10] bother me and I was trying to find my
[2:04:13] way I went and spent two years with my
[2:04:17] father so I could understand that I got
[2:04:21] so much from
[2:04:23] him and I came to the place I said I
[2:04:26] love my dad with all my
[2:04:28] heart and he's made me what I am and one
[2:04:32] day I got down on my knees and I said
[2:04:34] God I love my father but you're my
[2:04:41] father amen I need you to make me like
[2:04:44] you that's right I'm thankful for the
[2:04:48] light life he gave me I'm thankful for
[2:04:50] the wisdom I'm thankful for the
[2:04:52] construction knowledge and and all that
[2:04:54] he did for me amen but that's carnal
[2:05:00] right we're not going to a
[2:05:05] carnal all
[2:05:08] right and as I said Proverbs 23 and 7 23
[2:05:15] and 7 says as a man thinketh in his
[2:05:18] heart so
[2:05:18] [Music]
[2:05:23] is so
[2:05:25] we're we're
[2:05:28] predestinated okay I don't want to use
[2:05:30] the word predestinated excuse me I want
[2:05:33] to we're destined is what I mean to say
[2:05:38] we're destined to
[2:05:40] be the
[2:05:44] result of the things that we've
[2:05:46] heard and the things that were
[2:05:50] taught so we have the mind that is in us
[2:05:56] and that's what the the prophet of God
[2:05:58] was saying that though they the reason
[2:06:01] they rejected him was because of the
[2:06:05] mind that was in them was against
[2:06:09] God not that they weren't
[2:06:14] sincere not that they
[2:06:17] weren't one to do
[2:06:20] right but the word of God tells us a way
[2:06:24] seeth right unto a man but the end of
[2:06:27] that way is
[2:06:29] death and man will stay with that
[2:06:34] story and he'll defend his actions he'll
[2:06:38] defend his thinking he he'll explain it
[2:06:42] a and lay it out there and hold to it
[2:06:45] true and yet stick to that carnal
[2:06:50] reality that he's living
[2:06:53] in stick to uh stick to the the the very
[2:07:01] uh
[2:07:03] discernments that he
[2:07:08] has and they're
[2:07:10] Kel and they're Kel because we're
[2:07:15] carnal and when we stay carnal
[2:07:19] we're going to get carnal
[2:07:22] results so really this
[2:07:26] morning if I could say this in closing
[2:07:30] most of our problems in
[2:07:34] life are because of the way that we
[2:07:38] measure the way that we
[2:07:41] discern the the the way that we
[2:07:45] calculate yes
[2:07:47] sir
[2:07:49] the way that we
[2:07:52] perceive
[2:07:55] and
[2:07:58] it's
[2:08:04] man it's
[2:08:06] man he says it's just man that's what he
[2:08:11] said we just heard him he says that's
[2:08:12] just the way man
[2:08:16] is man's mind mind and man's thinking
[2:08:21] and man's discernment is
[2:08:26] death man in their effort to try to make
[2:08:31] life better is making life
[2:08:35] worse they're Hy breing food they're Hy
[2:08:39] breing science they're Hy breing this
[2:08:42] they made an automobile that killed
[2:08:44] Millions come they made bombs that
[2:08:48] destroy
[2:08:50] right they make machines now that have
[2:08:53] robbed us of our privacy right you can't
[2:08:57] sin and
[2:09:00] repent and put it under the blood
[2:09:03] anymore without it becoming public
[2:09:06] knowledge and destroying somebody nobody
[2:09:09] will ever apply the blood they won't
[2:09:12] wash it out of their minds they won't
[2:09:13] wash it out of their thinking they'll
[2:09:16] hold it against the person that be
[2:09:18] becomes that person's reputation that
[2:09:20] becomes the way that that person is that
[2:09:23] becomes what they are oh brother such
[2:09:25] and such uh he fell he stumbled he did
[2:09:29] this he did that that's his reputation
[2:09:31] that's his history you think anybody's
[2:09:33] spiritual enough to look through the
[2:09:35] blood the blood says if you look through
[2:09:37] the blood that's thrown in the godd of
[2:09:40] but we're not spiritual enough to do
[2:09:43] it if you have a history of a brother
[2:09:46] you have a history of the sister and
[2:09:49] you're still remembering the way that
[2:09:51] they were you'll be judged by what God
[2:09:53] thinks of them not what you think of
[2:10:02] them so really what what what what was
[2:10:06] it that man needed
[2:10:11] Hallelujah really when man was sitting
[2:10:14] here in the condition that they are
[2:10:18] their very education their very science
[2:10:21] their very culture is leading them and
[2:10:25] destroying them you know what's
[2:10:28] destroying us is our
[2:10:34] mind and why would the scripture say let
[2:10:37] this mind that was in
[2:10:40] Christ be in
[2:10:42] you because
[2:10:45] really the gift that that was given at
[2:10:49] Christmas was not a carnal gift it was a
[2:10:52] spiritual
[2:10:57] gift God was giving us a way to
[2:11:03] think
[2:11:05] amen he was giving all mankind yes
[2:11:09] sir a different approach to
[2:11:14] life a different discernment of life
[2:11:18] life yes sir a different discernment of
[2:11:23] sickness a different discernment of
[2:11:26] trouble yes
[2:11:27] sir Peter said it this way thinking not
[2:11:30] strange that the fiery darts of the
[2:11:35] enemy that the trying of your
[2:11:38] faith it's more precious than gold
[2:11:41] that's a spiritual
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:46] mind that's a mind that is now in the
[2:11:49] Realms of
[2:11:51] Glory saying nothing in this world can
[2:11:54] hinder
[2:11:57] me
[2:11:59] hallelu prophet of God tries to do it
[2:12:02] and get that message AC crust us he said
[2:12:05] the sunshiny skar Skies doesn't mean
[2:12:08] that God's for you near does the rain
[2:12:11] and the clouds mean that God's against
[2:12:17] you
[2:12:19] the gift of God was a
[2:12:22] spiritual
[2:12:24] mind it was a spiritual
[2:12:30] gift it was a it was a thing that that
[2:12:34] would change your course
[2:12:41] yes you look back on all your
[2:12:45] complexes so many of us still l let our
[2:12:49] past things that have happened to us in
[2:12:51] the
[2:12:54] past still weigh us
[2:12:57] down still affect the way that we deal
[2:13:01] with
[2:13:04] people it's affected me that's all right
[2:13:09] when I get deeply
[2:13:12] hurt and deeply offended and my heart
[2:13:15] gets
[2:13:16] broken
[2:13:18] I I I roll back into a
[2:13:21] shell and I protect that
[2:13:24] spot and then if I I try to I I I get
[2:13:29] weary to get close and I get weary to
[2:13:33] let go I I walk around in in the
[2:13:36] protection
[2:13:38] mode my defense mechanism is is quick to
[2:13:42] come up yeah punch first ask questions
[2:13:45] later right
[2:13:51] I lack
[2:13:54] trust and when I lack trust I begin to
[2:13:57] lack
[2:14:00] peace and all of a sudden I'm in the
[2:14:04] realm of
[2:14:06] carnality every day of my
[2:14:10] life oh I worship God God's glory I love
[2:14:14] you Lord I praise you with our lips we
[2:14:18] do worship him but our
[2:14:22] hearts the way a man thinketh in his
[2:14:25] heart so is
[2:14:27] he I can greet somebody on the street
[2:14:30] but what how it is when when when
[2:14:34] there's a a built-in fear like I want to
[2:14:37] meet this person but what if they don't
[2:14:39] like
[2:14:40] me huah or what what if I don't make a
[2:14:44] good first impression and and I'll
[2:14:46] guarantee I haven't been given the gift
[2:14:48] of a good first
[2:14:51] impression but I have found that a lot
[2:14:54] of people that got a good first
[2:14:55] impression it's the ones you want to
[2:14:57] keep your eye
[2:15:02] on and and
[2:15:05] I I I have
[2:15:09] things that
[2:15:11] are
[2:15:14] circumstantial I have things that are
[2:15:16] history
[2:15:18] and the word of God speaks out and says
[2:15:22] leave those things yeah which are behind
[2:15:26] behind sir and press into a higher
[2:15:32] calling that's what the Lord brought
[2:15:34] this is this gift Lord that God is
[2:15:37] giving the world it's a
[2:15:41] spiritual

[2:16:55] Sheep he smelled like the Sheep he
[2:16:57] laughed like the Sheep he talked with
[2:16:58] the Sheep but yet he was spiritual

[2:18:37] come under
[2:18:38] subjection to the spiritual revelation
[2:18:42] of God's word that whatever circumstance
[2:18:46] you're in you make a Christ mind
[2:18:52] decision might seem crazy to the world
[2:18:54] but God will stand by
[2:18:59] it and it'll work out every
[2:19:04] time because the very
[2:19:08] gift that he gave was how that he
[2:19:14] thought
[2:19:16] wow
[2:19:20] thank you Lord that's what he was
[2:19:25] giving he argued with his disciples why
[2:19:28] do you murmur why do you act like this
[2:19:31] basically he was saying why do you think
[2:19:33] that way you don't think that that
[2:19:36] Father Knows Hallelujah I have need to
[2:19:39] go by this
[2:19:41] place amen well why is he going there
[2:19:44] that's what's he talking to that woman
[2:19:46] for don't know come
[2:19:50] on wouldn't you have liked to have had
[2:19:53] the spiritual mind and say oh the
[2:19:55] Master's talking to this woman there's a
[2:19:58] great Revival fixing to happen Samaria
[2:20:03] is about to receive the word of God this
[2:20:07] is God Almighty they couldn't in fact
[2:20:09] well all of a sudden he stands up on the
[2:20:11] boat Lord don't
[2:20:13] you don't you afraid that we perish how
[2:20:17] many of us today say aren't you afraid
[2:20:20] I'm going to perish and what's his
[2:20:22] answer oh you of little
[2:20:28] faith and he stands up on that bow of
[2:20:30] the boat he says
[2:20:33] peace be
[2:20:35] still
[2:20:37] hallu Sun breaks through the sky the
[2:20:41] water lays flat and they sit back and
[2:20:44] say what manner of man
[2:20:48] is
[2:20:49] this hallu hallu you know what you are
[2:20:54] with a carnal mind you're just another
[2:21:06] religion I can say this and I and you
[2:21:09] know I'm not saying this against the
[2:21:11] messenger I'm saying against what we've
[2:21:14] made the
[2:21:15] messenger and what we''ve made what he
[2:21:19] taught we've turned it into doctrines
[2:21:22] and we've come up with a message
[2:21:27] thinking and we've taken this message
[2:21:29] and made it
[2:21:34] carnal the greatest spiritual
[2:21:38] gift since the time of our Lord
[2:21:43] Jesus yes sir they made it carnal
[2:21:46] because they weren't
[2:21:50] willing to accept the
[2:21:54] truth when it showed them they were
[2:21:59] wrong the greatest
[2:22:01] Zeal for this age is to say I was
[2:22:09] wrong I didn't even look at this
[2:22:12] situation the way that it really is
[2:22:15] because the way that things really are
[2:22:18] cannot be found in carnal
[2:22:22] discernment that's right or in carnal
[2:22:26] thinking right or in Earthly Living Lord
[2:22:30] I Thank You Jesus the the right mind
[2:22:33] can't the mind of Christ cannot be found
[2:22:36] in anything that's mixed and is serving
[2:22:40] two
[2:22:45] masters it isn't your thinking and his
[2:22:48] thinking it isn't a blend of your
[2:22:52] religion and his
[2:22:54] doctrines it's
[2:22:57] surrender and
[2:23:02] death and saying Lord let this
[2:23:08] mind that was in you be in me
[2:23:14] amen and no wonder he said I'll send you
[2:23:17] another
[2:23:18] comforter and he'll be with you even in
[2:23:22] you till the end and he'll lead you and
[2:23:26] guide you into all truth and
[2:23:33] righteousness
[2:23:35] life is not
[2:23:39] works life is something that comes in
[2:23:42] you that you view
[2:23:45] life from your heart
[2:23:48] and if Christ be in your
[2:23:50] heart and your heart hungers for
[2:23:54] spirituality then that's what you'll
[2:24:00] be and when I look at this Christmas I
[2:24:05] understand that it wasn't just God
[2:24:09] sending a
[2:24:14] Healer we need healing amen
[2:24:17] but we have to have a reason for why
[2:24:19] we're
[2:24:22] healed we've got to confess that we
[2:24:25] believe that we're healed we've got to
[2:24:28] have a
[2:24:29] purpose that we want to be healed
[2:24:38] for but yet this body will
[2:24:42] die it's got to die because we have one
[2:24:45] waiting amen for us it's got to be
[2:24:50] changed God can Deliver Us from
[2:24:57] finances I've paid a lot of people's
[2:25:00] rent I've made a lot of people's car
[2:25:04] payments because their
[2:25:06] finances not because of their finances
[2:25:10] because of the mind that they have an
[2:25:14] understanding of money
[2:25:18] of
[2:25:24] work they find the easy
[2:25:27] way and the pastor the quick easy
[2:25:33] way too lazy to take two jobs too lazy
[2:25:37] to work
[2:25:40] overtime too lazy to cut back on the
[2:25:43] things the pleasures that they have
[2:25:48] too lazy to cut off their Internet movie
[2:25:52] service too late to cut lazy to cut off
[2:25:55] this too too proud to get rid of a car
[2:25:59] they can't
[2:26:04] afford cuz their mind's not
[2:26:10] right and until you change the Mind
[2:26:13] you'll never change the reality right
[2:26:17] and it'll repeat itself and repeat
[2:26:20] itself and they'll run to God and
[2:26:23] they'll say God help me and all they've
[2:26:25] done is made God
[2:26:28] carnal all they want to do is God
[2:26:31] manifest in the carnal realm I until I
[2:26:35] can see them until I can touch them
[2:26:38] until I can put my
[2:26:41] finger in the holes in his hand I won't
[2:26:45] believe him
[2:26:53] Church God's
[2:26:55] gift was
[2:26:57] freedom from
[2:27:02] carnality my kingdom is not of this
[2:27:05] world if it was mine would be here to
[2:27:08] fight for
[2:27:10] me he looks at pilate he says you would
[2:27:13] have no Authority unless my Father in
[2:27:15] Heaven gave it to
[2:27:19] you he didn't change the course of
[2:27:24] history when it came to his
[2:27:28] flesh I love that song he could have
[2:27:31] called 10,000
[2:27:37] angels but there was he had a spiritual
[2:27:42] mind he had a spiritual understanding he
[2:27:46] didn't do nothing until his Father
[2:27:48] revealed it to him he was led his mind
[2:27:52] was not the mind of this
[2:27:55] world he went to Calvary because of his
[2:27:59] own cuz he knew there was a
[2:28:02] people predestinated people that he
[2:28:05] wanted to give to
[2:28:08] them how he saw
[2:28:11] life thank you Lord how he discerned
[2:28:15] situations how he
[2:28:18] responded turn the other
[2:28:20] cheek if you're compelled to go a mile
[2:28:24] go
[2:28:25] TW don't borrow or or don't lend in
[2:28:31] hopes to receive
[2:28:36] again what is it

[2:28:43] life and Truth

[2:28:51] right you have to know that what God's
[2:28:54] gift to you is the
[2:28:57] spiritual Mind Of
[2:29:00] God it's not a carnal gift thank you
[2:29:03] Lord it's a gift that'll rise you above
[2:29:07] carnality it'll rise you above Judgment
[2:29:10] of any man it'll make every man pure in
[2:29:13] your
[2:29:14] sight Glory the prophet of God said it
[2:29:17] would take I believe he said like like U
[2:29:22] silk and gingham or whatever that cloth
[2:29:25] is Muslim cloth if I can say it that he
[2:29:28] says it'll put them together and make
[2:29:30] them live in harmony it'll take every
[2:29:32] big eyy and little you out of the
[2:29:34] situation and out of the
[2:29:38] circumstance you know what it is to have
[2:29:41] a spiritual mind is
[2:29:43] freedom and life
[2:29:47] true you you don't care what people
[2:29:49] think of you because you know you're
[2:29:53] nothing and you know if
[2:29:57] God is for you who can be against
[2:30:02] you I love what the prophet of God said
[2:30:05] before I go someplace I pray till I know
[2:30:08] that God sent me he says because I know
[2:30:11] when I get there they're going to say oh
[2:30:14] brother the meeting's been cancelled and
[2:30:16] oh this is such and such thing and
[2:30:18] that's such and such thing and he said I
[2:30:21] can stand there and say I've come in the
[2:30:23] name of the
[2:30:25] Lord God Will Make A Way yes
[2:30:32] sir this
[2:30:35] message was the mind of God hallelujah
[2:30:39] for this
[2:30:43] age it's spiritual life amen and
[2:30:49] discernment just as God went to the
[2:30:52] Gentiles that's right he came back in
[2:30:55] this
[2:30:56] generation veiled himself
[2:30:59] hallu in human
[2:31:01] flesh and wasn't giving to
[2:31:05] us
[2:31:09] religion or secrets to build churches or
[2:31:13] gather people together right
[2:31:17] he was giving us the
[2:31:19] mind of God Amen for the time and age
[2:31:24] that we were living in so we could take
[2:31:27] on the spiritual mind of the word of God
[2:31:31] and be set
[2:31:33] free from all this
[2:31:36] stress and all this
[2:31:39] pressure and all this worry and finally
[2:31:43] so we could come to the such a spiritual
[2:31:46] mind mind that we look
[2:31:48] up because our Redemption draweth near
[2:31:53] and with hope and joy in our heart we
[2:31:55] could say even so come
[2:31:59] quickly Lord
[2:32:03] Jesus he didn't come to give you
[2:32:06] something
[2:32:08] physical he came to give you something
[2:32:13] spiritual it's a spiritual gift
[2:32:20] it was man's
[2:32:23] mind as religious as they
[2:32:27] were that caused to miss it but he said
[2:32:31] I'll reveal myself un
[2:32:34] babes such as are
[2:32:37] willing to
[2:32:41] learn are we willing to learn this
[2:32:45] morning
[2:32:49] are we willing to sit back and say you
[2:32:51] know what I may not be
[2:32:54] right that's what I said this morning I
[2:32:56] wasn't right about
[2:32:58] Orlando when I first met him I thought
[2:33:02] you was off your
[2:33:06] rocker but the prophet of God said if
[2:33:10] you draw a circle and put you out you
[2:33:13] just draw a
[2:33:14] circle he said if you don't let them and
[2:33:16] get closer to
[2:33:20] them walk a few miles in their
[2:33:26] steps then one day I realized he loved
[2:33:29] me and I loved him and I could say that
[2:33:33] about so many of you I realized
[2:33:37] hey I love
[2:33:40] him I still think he's off his rocker
[2:33:43] but I still love
[2:33:45] him
[2:33:48] we can't even nowadays accept hardly
[2:33:51] that somebody loves
[2:33:55] us we can't genuinely in our
[2:34:00] heart these words
[2:34:03] Church mean so much to
[2:34:06] me when Peter looked at the Lord and
[2:34:10] said Lord you know all
[2:34:13] things you know
[2:34:16] oh that I love
[2:34:25] you I thought
[2:34:27] Lord I want to know you love
[2:34:33] me a spiritual
[2:34:36] mind will let you believe in
[2:34:42] yourself it'll quit throwing yourself in
[2:34:44] the dirt it'll keep throwing yourself
[2:34:48] under the bus it'll finally let you know
[2:34:51] that God so loved me he gave his only
[2:34:54] begotten son and I was yet a sinner he
[2:34:58] died for
[2:35:00] me it'll let you rise up in the
[2:35:05] Realms of the
[2:35:08] impossible it'll let you know things are
[2:35:11] not as they
[2:35:14] appear they're not as they
[2:35:18] seen cuz I don't look out and discern
[2:35:21] how things are I look to the Unseen
[2:35:26] God and I know that the Messiah is here
[2:35:31] now to do for me exceedingly and
[2:35:35] abundantly above what I could ask or
[2:35:44] think
[2:35:48] Revelation is the change of the
[2:35:56] Mind sin is revelation
[2:36:01] perverted and I hope this morning that
[2:36:03] you can see what I'm trying to say God's
[2:36:06] gift to us is
[2:36:11] spiritual don't even look for it in the
[2:36:14] carnal but because the spirit changes
[2:36:20] everything carnality is just
[2:36:25] rearranging the
[2:36:28] puzzle it's like changing furniture in a
[2:36:31] room you just move this here and that
[2:36:34] there and this there and you end up in
[2:36:37] the same place with the same
[2:36:41] stuff but a spiritual mind is life
[2:36:47] and it's
[2:36:49] peace really understand what God was
[2:36:53] giving the world he was giving them a
[2:36:58] more beautiful way to think than they
[2:37:02] ever imagined he said you
[2:37:08] say you
[2:37:10] say but I say unto
[2:37:14] you you read the scripture and you say
[2:37:18] but I say unto you and our messenger
[2:37:22] took a message one day and he said hear
[2:37:24] ye
[2:37:26] him hear ye him you're not going to find
[2:37:32] him in the carnal Realms of this
[2:37:36] world you're not going to find
[2:37:41] him in
[2:37:43] Civilization education
[2:37:46] you're going to find him in the
[2:37:49] spirit for all that worship Him must
[2:37:53] worship Him in
[2:37:56] spirit and in
[2:37:59] truth and it's the truth that sets you
[2:38:03] free and the only way you'll ever see
[2:38:06] truth is not through your carnal
[2:38:12] judgments but is through the spiritual
[2:38:15] inside
[2:38:16] it of the revealed word of God to your
[2:38:21] heart so really what was
[2:38:24] it that God brought the
[2:38:27] world really what was
[2:38:30] it that the gift that he was giving to
[2:38:34] us and did we really understand
[2:38:39] it did we really know what it
[2:38:42] was it was rejected because of the way
[2:38:45] way that it was
[2:38:46] wrapped it was rejected because who it
[2:38:49] came
[2:38:50] to but yet God so loved the
[2:38:54] world he gave his only begotten
[2:38:58] son and what was
[2:39:01] he he was the
[2:39:03] word and what is the word it's a
[2:39:09] thought
[2:39:12] expressed he was giving us the mind of
[2:39:17] God because that mind will change the
[2:39:22] world that you live in God bless you
[2:39:25] this morning let's

[2:41:08] life I was going to take my
[2:41:14] life
[2:41:16] until the great father through the word
[2:41:19] of God whispered the name of Jesus to
[2:41:25] me and I found out that there was

[2:41:31] different from the inside
