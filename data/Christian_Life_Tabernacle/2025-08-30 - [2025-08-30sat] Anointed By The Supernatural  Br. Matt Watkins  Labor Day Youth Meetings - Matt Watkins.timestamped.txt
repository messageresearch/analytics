[13:58] there's nothing like knowing you in the
[14:00] power of the resurrection, Lord. Came to
[14:03] us when we were dead in sin and
[14:04] trespass, not knowing you, Father. And
[14:08] you came and you opened our eyes, Lord.
[14:10] And we could say we could never be the
[14:11] same. And Father, our darkness has
[14:14] become light. Father, our sorrow and our
[14:17] broken heart, you've mended. And Lord,
[14:19] the greatest thing we've ever known is
[14:21] the power of your presence, Lord. And we
[14:23] still believe that lives are transformed
[14:25] in your presence. And Father, we invite
[14:28] you here to have the preeminence, Lord.
[14:30] And may you soften the hardest of
[14:32] hearts. And Father, where the devil
[14:34] would have come and tried to sew snares
[14:36] and hindrances, Lord, we want to invite
[14:38] you, Father. And Lord, bid you come and
[14:42] deal with each heart in a special way,
[14:44] the way only you can. Father, you hold
[14:46] the hearts of kings in your hand. You
[14:48] could take the hardest of hearts and
[14:49] soften it. Father, in one moment in your
[14:52] presence, Lord, all things become new.
[14:54] And Lord, that's what our desire is,
[14:56] Father, that you would come now. And
[14:58] Lord, that you would be the one that's
[15:00] walking in the midst and dealing with
[15:02] the hearts. And Father, with you in the
[15:05] first place, Lord, surely there'll be a
[15:07] heart that are in one mind, in one
[15:10] accord where you have the preeminence,
[15:12] Father. So, we cast aside all else now.
[15:14] We commit this service to you. And
[15:16] Father, may the worship be received and
[15:18] pleasing to you. and are the words that
[15:20] were spoke, there'll be life and
[15:22] deliverance, Father, and you will set
[15:24] the captive free. And that's our
[15:26] expectation, Lord. We commit it all to
[15:28] you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

[1:11:20] A song of praise and love
[1:11:26] from those who have redeemed.
[1:11:34] We will use the words we know
[1:11:38] to tell you what
[1:11:42] awome
[1:11:43] God you are.
[1:11:50] to tell you.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Our loving father.
[1:12:02] Lord, we wish we had words.
[1:12:06] We wish we could write songs
[1:12:12] to express to you the love that you have
[1:12:15] shown us.
[1:12:20] But Lord, our hearts beat for you
[1:12:25] to walk with you, to talk with you, to
[1:12:28] be in your presence,
[1:12:32] to have you come by and
[1:12:36] just reach out and touch us.
[1:12:40] Let us know that it'll be all right.
[1:12:44] That you have everything in control and
[1:12:48] you know the beginning from the end and
[1:12:51] we don't have to worry.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Father, may we find that loving peace
[1:12:57] that you so promised us
[1:13:00] that joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:13:05] That peace that surpass understanding.
[1:13:09] Father, it's all available to us
[1:13:11] tonight.
[1:13:13] And I pray, Father, that you would
[1:13:15] remove any hindrance
[1:13:17] that would keep us from looking upon
[1:13:20] your face
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; and telling you what an awesome God
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; that you are.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; We ask it this evening in Jesus' name we
[1:13:30] pray.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:13:41] Certainly nice to be in the house of the
[1:13:44] Lord. You know, a lot of times we we say
[1:13:48] that it's a young people's service and
[1:13:52] then the old people don't think they
[1:13:55] they should come.
[1:13:58] But you know, there's not a young
[1:13:59] people's gospel and an old people's
[1:14:01] gospel. All right. Amen.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; There's been one gospel
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; before there ever was ever time. In the
[1:14:09] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:14:12] with God
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; and the word was God.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; So, we're so grateful for that. I I was
[1:14:20] thinking just as we were here and I
[1:14:23] thought, you know,
[1:14:25] man always
[1:14:29] believes in God and wants to meet God.
[1:14:32] They know that there is a God,
[1:14:35] but it's hard to make that God become
[1:14:37] personal to you. And the Lord made it
[1:14:42] easy for that to happen
[1:14:45] because of the way that he presented
[1:14:47] himself.
[1:14:49] And you know, he didn't present himself
[1:14:51] as one that uh would strike you dead if
[1:14:56] you look crossways or you better line up
[1:15:00] or you better be in fear else, you know,
[1:15:03] judgment's going to strike. You know, a
[1:15:06] lot of people think that's what church
[1:15:08] is. You know, boy, if the pastor uh gets
[1:15:11] on you, you know, you boy, you're in
[1:15:13] trouble and all that. No, he never did
[1:15:15] that.
[1:15:17] He presented himself as a father
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; and Jesus said, "You know which one of
[1:15:23] you having an earthly father
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; and your child would want a loaf of
[1:15:30] bread that you would give him a stone?"
[1:15:35] He said, "Or or which of your earthly
[1:15:38] fathers uh if your child would desire a
[1:15:42] fish that you would give him a serpent?"
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; See, he he wanted you to know that he's
[1:15:51] a father.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He's not he he's he's not against you,
[1:15:58] that he's for you. And he wants to do
[1:16:01] for you exceedingly
[1:16:04] and abundantly
[1:16:06] above what you can ask or think.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; And I and I, you know, I I I had a
[1:16:13] father. My father's passed on. And I I
[1:16:16] knew I could count on my earthly father.
[1:16:20] I knew that if I ever went bankrupt or
[1:16:24] or lost money or got ill, I knew my dad
[1:16:28] would be there for me. But one day, my
[1:16:32] father passed away and I didn't have
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:36] place of security.
[1:16:38] But I was able to turn and understand
[1:16:40] that I had a father.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And sometimes our home life isn't what
[1:16:46] we wanted. Sometimes the way we were
[1:16:48] raised up wasn't what we wanted.
[1:16:51] Sometimes the past
[1:16:54] isn't the way that we wanted it.
[1:16:57] Sometimes we have a lot of tragedy and
[1:17:01] sorrow in our life.
[1:17:04] But the Lord always wants you to know
[1:17:06] that he's a father.
[1:17:09] And that's the heart that he said he
[1:17:13] when the the disciples said teach us to
[1:17:15] pray he said our father
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; which art in heaven hallowed be thy name
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; and we and as we go forward in this
[1:17:28] weekend our our heart's desire for a
[1:17:31] long time is how do we go forward
[1:17:35] what where do we go from here and I I
[1:17:39] think we've got to reset our mind,
[1:17:42] reset our attitudes towards God and try
[1:17:46] to learn to know him how that he wants
[1:17:50] to be known instead of what men tell us
[1:17:54] to meet him ourselves.
[1:17:56] And so every little person here, young
[1:17:59] people, I know many of you from 12 to
[1:18:04] 20s, early 30s, all those great
[1:18:07] development years, all those years of
[1:18:10] mental struggle, all those years of
[1:18:12] trying to figure out who you are and
[1:18:15] where you're going, you know, and and
[1:18:18] but there's one thing that you I hope
[1:18:20] you come to know that you have a father.
[1:18:24] And he was your father before your
[1:18:26] earthly father.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; He knew you. He knew the parents that
[1:18:30] you would have.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; He even planned that your grandfather
[1:18:35] would meet your grandmother and your
[1:18:36] great greatgrandfather. And he he
[1:18:39] planned it all that they would come
[1:18:41] together all down through their family
[1:18:44] trees that you could be here today. I I
[1:18:47] I hope you can think about yourself that
[1:18:51] way is God knows me.
[1:18:54] He's the one that fathered me.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; He's the one that brought me here. I
[1:18:59] have a father
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; and he knows my name
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; and and and that's how he wants to
[1:19:07] present himself. And that father sent
[1:19:12] his only son.
[1:19:15] If I could say it this way, he sent our
[1:19:18] kinsman,
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; which means our brother,
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; our sister, one that was a part of our
[1:19:25] family.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; He sent him to us so that we might know
[1:19:30] that we're a part of the family of God.
[1:19:34] And so this great tonight, that's what
[1:19:39] my heart's desire is, is that we could
[1:19:43] draw closer to him
[1:19:45] and he could become to us what he
[1:19:50] desires to be to us,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; And that we could come to the
[1:19:54] realization of that. And that if you
[1:19:57] could just think in your heart, if God
[1:19:59] be before you,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; who can be against you?
[1:20:02] God's on my side.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; He loved me.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He knows me. He knows what I'm going
[1:20:09] through. He knows what I'm thinking. He
[1:20:11] knows what I suffered. And he's a
[1:20:13] father. And he wants to come by tonight
[1:20:17] and be that father to you
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; and touch you and and supply to you
[1:20:24] whatever your need would be. If you
[1:20:27] would open your heart to him tonight, I
[1:20:30] believe that he would certainly come by
[1:20:34] and touch you and be for you what you
[1:20:38] need. For he knows what you have need of
[1:20:42] even before you ask.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; I'm needy
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; and I have a father.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; What makes us family is we have the same
[1:20:53] father.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're privileged tonight to
[1:20:57] have Brother Matt Watkins with us and
[1:21:01] and uh to break the word of life to to
[1:21:06] to speak what's on his heart, to present
[1:21:10] to you a God that's real.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; As we said last night at the banquet, to
[1:21:16] tell you the truth
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; because the truth sets you free.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus said he was the way, the truth,
[1:21:23] the life. So there's one truth. Let
[1:21:26] God's word be true and every word of man
[1:21:31] be alive.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; So God loves you tonight, young people.
[1:21:36] If you've never had a touch from him
[1:21:39] tonight
[1:21:41] or you don't you're up against something
[1:21:43] that you don't think that you can get
[1:21:45] through. If you'll just reach up tonight
[1:21:48] and say, "Father,
[1:21:51] Father,
[1:21:53] you're a father to me. You put me here.
[1:21:57] And you wouldn't have put me here if you
[1:21:59] wouldn't take care of me.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; And I need you tonight." and he will do
[1:22:04] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:22:07] you could ask or think. As we invite
[1:22:10] Brother Matt to come preach to us
[1:22:11] tonight, if we'd stand together, maybe
[1:22:14] we could sing that little tune, I have a
[1:22:16] father.
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:23] He knows my name.
[1:22:26] I have a maker.
[1:22:30] He's the one that
[1:22:32] made me the way that I am.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm here tonight to touch him, to
[1:22:38] contact him, to feel his presence, to
[1:22:41] know that he's real.
[1:22:45] to take me from a where that I am to
[1:22:50] a greater and more meaningful life
[1:22:57] because without him I can do nothing.
[1:23:01] God bless you as we prepare our hearts
[1:23:03] for our brother.
[1:23:07] I have a maker
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:14] before my heart
[1:23:20] and before even time began.
[1:23:26] My life was in his hand.
[1:23:34] He knows my name.
[1:23:40] He knows my every thought.
[1:23:47] He sees each
[1:23:50] and fall
[1:23:52] and hears me when I call.
[1:24:00] I have a thought.
[1:24:07] He calls his home
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:13] and he'll never
[1:24:18] believe it.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; No matter where I go.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He knows my name.
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:33] He knows my Every thought
[1:24:39] he sees
[1:24:41] each tear that voice
[1:24:45] and he hears me well.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Can you sing that again now? I have a
[1:24:50] father. Sing it to the Lord now. I have
[1:24:54] a father.
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:25:00] He calls me his own.
[1:25:05] Yes, sir. He'll never
[1:25:08] leave me.
[1:25:11] No matter where I go.
[1:25:19] He knows
[1:25:21] my name.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. He knows
[1:25:28] my every thought.
[1:25:32] He sees
[1:25:34] each tear that falls
[1:25:38] and he hears me when I call. One more
[1:25:42] time. He knows my name. Sing that again
[1:25:44] now. And he knows
[1:25:48] my name.
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:25:54] I am. every thought.
[1:25:59] He sees
[1:26:01] each tear that falls
[1:26:04] and he hears me when I call.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you glad that you have a
[1:26:12] father? Amen. Tonight, the Bible says
[1:26:15] that he has not given us the spirit of
[1:26:17] fear. Amen. But of power and of a sound
[1:26:20] mind. Amen. You believe that? You know
[1:26:22] why? Because we've got the voice of our
[1:26:24] father. Amen. And I believe that he's
[1:26:26] here to speak to us tonight. How many
[1:26:27] just want to say, "Lord, I want to
[1:26:29] listen to what you have." Let me be
[1:26:31] sensitive to what you have, Lord. Amen.
[1:26:34] Didn't come to hear the voice of a man.
[1:26:36] Amen. But I came to hear the voice of my
[1:26:38] father.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord bless you. Amen. This
[1:26:41] evening, such a privilege to be here
[1:26:43] with you. Amen. Just count it such an
[1:26:45] honor. Amen. I wonder just before we go
[1:26:48] to the word if there maybe you just bow
[1:26:50] your heads with me all around the
[1:26:52] building. Wonder if there'd be a need
[1:26:54] maybe something upon your heart. Amen.
[1:26:57] Gathered in a place like this. And we've
[1:26:59] sang, we've worshiped, we've felt the
[1:27:01] atmosphere and the the blowing of that
[1:27:04] wind of Calvary, amen, has blowed
[1:27:06] through this building. But I wonder if
[1:27:07] there'd be somebody here tonight that
[1:27:09] just would lift a hand and say, "Lord, I
[1:27:10] need a touch from you." And I I'm just
[1:27:13] going to raise it up, Lord. My need,
[1:27:14] Father. I'm going to hold it high, Lord.
[1:27:17] And I'm going to say, "Here it is,
[1:27:18] Father. Behind this hand is a need
[1:27:20] that's represented maybe for a mother, a
[1:27:23] father, a daughter, a son. Whatever it
[1:27:26] would be tonight, Lord Jesus, you told
[1:27:28] Abraham, "Is anything too hard for the
[1:27:31] Lord?" Nothing is Jesus. Lord, you said
[1:27:35] in your word, if you ask anything in my
[1:27:38] name and don't doubt, you'll have what
[1:27:40] you ask for. Your prophet taught us when
[1:27:42] we ask, believe. Lord, he preached a
[1:27:44] message called Believe from the Heart,
[1:27:47] Lord. And that's what we want to do
[1:27:48] tonight. We want to believe from our
[1:27:51] heart that when we ask, Lord, you're
[1:27:53] going to do it. Now, God, the same God
[1:27:56] that so constrained me, Lord, even in
[1:27:58] the back office before I came out here
[1:28:00] and turned my whole direction around and
[1:28:03] gave me my text, Lord, something,
[1:28:05] Father, I didn't come to these this to
[1:28:08] this to these meetings, Lord, even
[1:28:09] expecting to preach. But Lord, you're in
[1:28:12] divine control, Lord. I believe it's
[1:28:15] only because you work on both ends. And
[1:28:17] there's a there's a Lord, a little lamb
[1:28:19] that's crying out. It has a need, a
[1:28:21] father, and from their heart, Lord
[1:28:23] Jesus, they're asking for a touch from
[1:28:25] the master. Now, Lord, if that little
[1:28:28] woman with that blood issue, your
[1:28:29] prophet taught us that you, Lord, that
[1:28:32] the father showed you everything. But
[1:28:34] your prophet said that little woman with
[1:28:37] that blood issue, Lord, he didn't show
[1:28:40] you that. That's why when she reached
[1:28:42] out and touched you, you said, "Who
[1:28:44] touched me?"
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, your prophet said that from her
[1:28:48] need, she reached out.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; From her need, Lord, she reached out a
[1:28:54] hand of faith and said, "If I could just
[1:28:56] touch the hymn of his garment, then
[1:28:58] everything will be changed. Everything
[1:29:00] will be different." Now, God, your
[1:29:02] prophet taught us if we come on the same
[1:29:04] basis of anyone we find in the Bible,
[1:29:07] Lord, that you're obligated to do the
[1:29:09] same thing tonight. So Lord, we lift up
[1:29:11] our hands. We represent our need and
[1:29:13] say, "Jesus, I am reaching out with the
[1:29:16] arm of faith, Lord, believing that
[1:29:18] you're still the same yesterday, today,
[1:29:20] and forever, Lord. And you're here to
[1:29:22] speak to minister to your needs, the
[1:29:24] needs of your children, Lord. May you
[1:29:26] just take us one and all, Father. Help
[1:29:28] us to, Lord, just to set aside our
[1:29:31] minds, our Lord, any thoughts, anything
[1:29:34] that would be a hindrance, Lord, and may
[1:29:36] we just focus in on what you have to
[1:29:38] say. We ask it in the name of the Lord
[1:29:40] Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen. Do you
[1:29:44] love the Lord Jesus?
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't we give the Lord a hand
[1:29:47] clap of praise? He is worthy. He's
[1:29:49] worthy. Amen.
[1:29:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:55] Amen. Second Kings chapter 2, if you
[1:29:57] have your Bible, I count it. Such an
[1:29:59] honor. Amen. Brother David, thank you so
[1:30:01] much for having us. And brother Matthew,
[1:30:04] Amen. for the vision that you have for
[1:30:06] these meetings and the young people.
[1:30:09] Amen. I just uh I just believe that Amen
[1:30:12] that God puts those kind of burdens upon
[1:30:14] men's heart. We don't just come up with
[1:30:16] those kind of things, but Amen. the Lord
[1:30:18] puts a a thought, a burden, an idea,
[1:30:20] have a banquet, have meetings. Amen.
[1:30:23] Aren't you glad that that God is in
[1:30:25] control?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we believe he's ordained these
[1:30:28] services. And so I just want to if I
[1:30:30] don't get a chance to say that, just
[1:30:32] want to say how honored we are. Amen.
[1:30:34] and and just consider myself, Amen, the
[1:30:36] least that could stand here and minister
[1:30:38] and and uh but I'm just uh I want to
[1:30:40] say, you know, I learned a long time ago
[1:30:42] how to let off the pressure from my
[1:30:45] insufficiencies and and incapabilities
[1:30:48] and and uh and because I'm not, you
[1:30:50] know, I feel like brother Brandon when
[1:30:52] he said, I Lord, you called me and I was
[1:30:54] never I was never sufficient from the
[1:30:56] day you called me. Amen. And I feel like
[1:30:58] that sometimes. But you know what? I
[1:30:59] read what the Apostle Paul said. Apostle
[1:31:02] Paul said, "I am what I am
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God."
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And can I just say that's enough.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have to be somebody. I
[1:31:11] don't have to be somebody great. I am
[1:31:12] what I am by the grace of God.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and that's enough. Amen. But
[1:31:17] we just want to uh minister to you
[1:31:19] tonight. And I just feel so burdened
[1:31:22] from the Lord uh even from the back. The
[1:31:24] Lord just took me in a different
[1:31:26] direction here. And so I just believe
[1:31:28] it's the Holy Spirit going to minister
[1:31:30] to you to something on something I've
[1:31:32] spoken before and I trust it'll be a
[1:31:34] blessing to you. Amen. I want to look at
[1:31:37] 2 Kings chapter 2. I'm going to title
[1:31:40] this service here tonight anointed
[1:31:43] by the supernatural. How many believe in
[1:31:46] a supernatural God?
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And how many believe that that
[1:31:51] supernatural God can become and touch a
[1:31:54] realm that is very natural? Amen.
[1:31:57] Because here we are. I'm here today. I'm
[1:31:59] I'm I you know, my my soul's been
[1:32:01] translated into the kingdom of God's
[1:32:03] dear son, but I'm still in a human body.
[1:32:06] I still got weaknesses. I still got
[1:32:08] struggles. I I still have battles. I
[1:32:10] still have trials and tribulations.
[1:32:13] Anybody else?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody else have problems and issues?
[1:32:16] Anybody got a need?
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; You mean I'm not preaching to theophanes
[1:32:20] here tonight? You're all just like me.
[1:32:22] Amen. But I'm glad we got a God
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; who the Bible says, "Whatsoever you bind
[1:32:27] on earth, it shall be bound. Whatsoever
[1:32:29] you loose, it shall be loosed."
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we know that we could touch
[1:32:33] that supernatural God. And I believe he
[1:32:35] wants to do that here tonight. Amen. And
[1:32:38] so we just want to give him liberty.
[1:32:40] Amen. And give him full sway. Let's
[1:32:42] begin reading here in 2 Kings chapter 2
[1:32:45] and verse one.
[1:32:49] And it came to pass when the Lord would
[1:32:51] take up Elijah into heaven by a
[1:32:53] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[1:32:57] from Gilgal. And Elijah said unto
[1:33:00] Elisha, "Try here, I pray thee, for the
[1:33:04] Lord has sent me to Bethl." And Elisha
[1:33:07] said unto him, "As the Lord liveth, and
[1:33:10] as thy soul liveth, I will not leave
[1:33:14] thee." So they went down to Bethl. The
[1:33:17] verse four says, "And Elijah said unto
[1:33:19] him, Elisha, Tarry, here I pray thee,
[1:33:22] for the Lord hath sent me to Jericho."
[1:33:25] And he said, "As the Lord liveth, and as
[1:33:28] thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee."
[1:33:32] So they came to Jericho. Verse six says,
[1:33:35] "And Elijah said unto him, Terry, I pray
[1:33:37] thee here, for the Lord hath sent me to
[1:33:40] Jordan." And he said, "As the Lord
[1:33:43] liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will
[1:33:46] not leave thee." Now, the prophet of God
[1:33:49] takes these three cities, Jericho,
[1:33:51] Bethl, and Jordan, and he makes and he
[1:33:54] tells us that they were representative
[1:33:56] of actually a stage of our Christian
[1:33:59] journey.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said it was a type
[1:34:02] of justification,
[1:34:04] sanctification, and then receiving the
[1:34:06] gift of the Holy Ghost. But then beyond
[1:34:09] just an anointing that comes on your
[1:34:10] flesh, you've got to receive the person
[1:34:13] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "You can't
[1:34:17] stay. You've got to come to each city,
[1:34:19] but you can't stay there cuz you got to
[1:34:22] cross Jordan."
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Barham says that his life
[1:34:26] was a type of us. Even he to points at
[1:34:28] Abraham and says Abraham's life was a
[1:34:30] type of us. Came out of a city of
[1:34:33] heathens. And and and and we know all of
[1:34:35] that. and and but God doesn't just leave
[1:34:37] him with Abram. He actually gives him a
[1:34:39] name change. So God does doesn't leave
[1:34:41] us at justification, nor does he leave
[1:34:44] us at sanctification.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Nor does he leave us with just a gift of
[1:34:48] the Holy Ghost,
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; but he was going to give Abram not just
[1:34:51] to something in his flesh, but he was
[1:34:53] going to go further than that. Not just
[1:34:55] an experience on his flesh. He was going
[1:34:56] to change his body.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; And so the prophet of God tells us and
[1:35:02] who is this Melzdc? What God did for
[1:35:04] Abraham is what he wants to do for every
[1:35:06] believer.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, do it in my life."
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; And notice here because all of these
[1:35:12] cities are going to be important. But he
[1:35:14] keeps moving him further. And and then
[1:35:16] he says here in verse six, Terry here.
[1:35:19] And then he says here in verse 8, "And
[1:35:21] Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[1:35:23] together and smoked the waters, and they
[1:35:26] were divided hither and thither so that
[1:35:28] they too went over on dry ground. And it
[1:35:31] came to pass when they were gone over
[1:35:32] that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask
[1:35:36] what I shall do for thee." Isn't it
[1:35:38] amazing?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; He asks him a question. Ask what I shall
[1:35:44] do for thee. Another word, Sister
[1:35:46] Hattie.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; It's what you say.
[1:35:54] You see, brother Brandham said that he's
[1:35:56] talking about the squirrels and he says,
[1:35:57] "I don't know what it was except Jehovah
[1:35:59] Gyra." And he said, "Sister Hadt," he
[1:36:01] said, "That's nothing but the truth,
[1:36:03] Brother Brandham." Amen.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said in one place
[1:36:07] when she spoke those words, it felt like
[1:36:10] the room was about to come apart.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; You mean that? You You're telling me,
[1:36:14] brother Matt, you think our words, our
[1:36:16] amens to the word of God don't do
[1:36:17] anything? What would have happened had
[1:36:19] she sat there and thought to herself or
[1:36:21] just gave a good nod? But she spoke and
[1:36:24] when she did something natural, it moved
[1:36:26] something supernatural.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; You see, your words have the ability to
[1:36:32] control your atmosphere.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Ask what I shall do for
[1:36:38] thee before I be taken away." Now watch
[1:36:40] this here very closely. And Elisha said,
[1:36:43] "I pray thee, let a double portion of
[1:36:46] thy spirit be upon me."
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads one more
[1:36:51] time. Lord Jesus, Father, we're so
[1:36:54] grateful for your divine presence. Lord,
[1:36:57] for you've made a divine promise that
[1:37:00] wherever two or three would be gathered,
[1:37:02] there you would be in our midst. Lord,
[1:37:04] now we're gathered here, Father. We came
[1:37:07] with one purpose, Lord. One objective,
[1:37:09] one goal, Lord. And I just want to say,
[1:37:13] Father, that my there's nothing more
[1:37:15] important in this service than that that
[1:37:17] we touch you, Lord. I pray, God, that
[1:37:20] you would just come right now. May this
[1:37:22] sermon be a gospel trumpet, Lord. And
[1:37:25] may when it blows, may it set every
[1:37:27] captive free, Lord. I pray that you
[1:37:30] would come and have your perfect way,
[1:37:32] Lord, as we just humble ourselves before
[1:37:34] your mighty hand or just your servant,
[1:37:36] Lord. Now, God, may you come and do what
[1:37:38] only you can do. We ask it in Jesus
[1:37:41] Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated.
[1:37:44] I want you to keep your place there in
[1:37:46] second Kings. And I just want to
[1:37:48] continue reading from there.
[1:37:54] The Bible says that he said, "Let a
[1:37:57] double portion," let's pick it up here
[1:37:58] in verse 9. "Let a double portion of thy
[1:38:03] spirit be upon me." And he said, "Thou
[1:38:05] has asked a hard thing." Now, I got a
[1:38:08] question. Who was it going to be hard
[1:38:10] for? You think it was hard for God? No.
[1:38:12] You think it was hard for who it was
[1:38:14] going to be hard for was Elisha?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; You see, as brother Brandham was told
[1:38:19] when the vision with the prophecy over
[1:38:21] his life with Danny Henry, he's told
[1:38:24] because you have chosen the harder way.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; You didn't ask for, you know, great
[1:38:28] great things, not a museum to be made to
[1:38:30] your name, not a fleet of Cadillacs, but
[1:38:32] because you made a choice of a harder
[1:38:35] way. In other words, I didn't force you.
[1:38:37] I didn't pressure you, but you by your
[1:38:40] own choice chose the harder way. And I
[1:38:42] love the words of that that vision that
[1:38:44] prophecy says, "But it's my way."
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; And so it's going to be a harder thing
[1:38:50] not for God, but for Elisha.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Nevertheless," notice this
[1:38:57] promise here. And he says,
[1:38:58] "Nevertheless,
[1:39:00] if thou see me when I am taken from
[1:39:03] thee, it shall be so unto thee. But if
[1:39:06] not, it shall not be so. What's so
[1:39:09] amazing about this verse is so powerful
[1:39:11] in verse 10. If you go and look up the
[1:39:14] Hebrew, actually the original Hebrew
[1:39:16] text, it's saying something that perhaps
[1:39:18] you've never caught before. I believe
[1:39:20] it's so uh so powerful that it's it's
[1:39:23] not it's not in the not just in the
[1:39:25] sense that Elijah is saying, Elisha,
[1:39:28] when I go, if you see it happen, then it
[1:39:30] will come to pass. And if you if you're
[1:39:32] if you're if you're distracted, then it
[1:39:33] won't. That's not really all it's
[1:39:35] saying. But actually what the Hebrew is
[1:39:37] transliterated to mean is that if you
[1:39:40] see, if you perceive, if you regard, if
[1:39:44] you look upon, to be taken, to be
[1:39:47] carried away, to be removed from you,
[1:39:51] with you, from your side. It literally
[1:39:54] means if you perceive me when I'm
[1:39:57] removed as being removed from you,
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; then it will come to pass. In other
[1:40:04] words, Elisha, what I'm Elijah is saying
[1:40:07] to Elisha, you must accept that I'm
[1:40:10] leaving. You must come to grips with not
[1:40:13] waiting for Elijah to come back. Not
[1:40:15] waiting for what God's going to do for
[1:40:17] Elijah, but Elisha, you've got to see
[1:40:20] Elijah has been taken. And there's still
[1:40:22] a work for you to do. There's still a
[1:40:25] job for you to do. There's still an
[1:40:27] anointing upon your life. You've got to
[1:40:30] see Elijah is gone. Elisha And in other
[1:40:33] words, what he's saying is if Elisha
[1:40:36] clung to Elijah, wishing him to remain,
[1:40:39] then it wouldn't come to pass.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I think it's just the same exact way for
[1:40:44] us, my brother, my sister. Let me just
[1:40:45] say it to you this way. God's prophet
[1:40:47] has ran his race. He has receive to me
[1:40:51] friends. He ran his race faithfully, and
[1:40:53] God anointed him for the job. But our
[1:40:56] work is still here. And there's still a
[1:40:58] commission on. There's still a job for
[1:41:00] the Church of the Living God to do. And
[1:41:02] you've got to stop looking for Elijah
[1:41:04] and start realizing that the same God
[1:41:07] that was with Elijah is still with
[1:41:09] Elisha tonight.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; And that's why there was a search of
[1:41:13] prophets that went for the for a search
[1:41:16] of prophets and men, the school of the
[1:41:17] prophets going to look for for Elijah.
[1:41:20] Where's Elijah? I tell you what though,
[1:41:21] Elisha didn't go on that search party.
[1:41:23] He went to the Jordan and he took the
[1:41:26] mantle of Elijah and he didn't say,
[1:41:27] "Where's Elijah?" And when he came to
[1:41:30] his needs, he said, "Where's the Lord
[1:41:32] God of Elijah?"
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And so notice here, I want you to pick
[1:41:38] it up here. He says, he says, the Bible
[1:41:40] says here in verse 11, and he says, "It
[1:41:42] came to pass as they still went on and
[1:41:44] talked, and behold, there appeared a
[1:41:45] chariot of fire and horses of fire, and
[1:41:48] parted them both aunderder, and Elijah
[1:41:50] went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And
[1:41:53] Elisha saw it and he cried, "My father,
[1:41:57] my father, the chariot of Israel and the
[1:42:01] horsemen thereof." Notice this here. The
[1:42:03] chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[1:42:05] thereof. And he saw him no more. And he
[1:42:11] took hold of his own clothes and ripp
[1:42:15] them into two pieces. And verse 13 says,
[1:42:18] "He took up also the mantle of Elijah
[1:42:20] that fell from him and went back and
[1:42:23] stood by the bank of the Jordan. And he
[1:42:25] took the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[1:42:27] him and smoke the waters and said,
[1:42:30] "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?"
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; When he had smitten the waters, they
[1:42:35] parted hither and thither, and Elisha
[1:42:38] went over. I think this is so such a
[1:42:40] powerful moment that we find here and
[1:42:42] it's just one example we could use to
[1:42:45] where Elijah is leaving. He's going
[1:42:47] home. He in fact knows that. So he
[1:42:50] intentionally takes Elisha to these
[1:42:53] cities. These were in an intentional
[1:42:55] journey. Elijah was going to take him to
[1:42:58] Bethl and to Jordan and to Jericho.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And what's amazing about this is that
[1:43:04] Elijah knows his departure is soon. You
[1:43:06] know, I believe, and you don't have to
[1:43:07] agree with this, it's just my own
[1:43:09] opinion. I believe that brother Brandham
[1:43:11] knew when he was about to leave the
[1:43:13] scene. I believe there was things that
[1:43:15] you could find on the tape with him
[1:43:16] saying things like this. He'd come to
[1:43:18] what house will you build me? And then
[1:43:20] he comes, you know, even before that,
[1:43:22] and he's saying things like, "I'm so
[1:43:24] thankful for your young pastor here that
[1:43:26] stands for the word of God and and and
[1:43:28] men of God like him that will take these
[1:43:30] truths and sweep it on unto the coming
[1:43:34] of the Lord." Let me let me just tell
[1:43:36] you what a prophet's vision was. His
[1:43:37] vision was never to body body up all of
[1:43:41] the power of God into one vessel. His
[1:43:44] vision was never to to take and lay
[1:43:45] aside all of the other ministers and all
[1:43:48] of the gifts and all of the the you know
[1:43:50] the b the rest of the body and just
[1:43:52] empower just have all the power bodied
[1:43:54] up in one man. No. But the prophet had a
[1:43:56] vision, my brother, for an entire
[1:43:59] unified bride that knows who they are,
[1:44:02] knows their God, knows their position,
[1:44:04] and comes to their calling because
[1:44:06] they've got a work to do.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I know that we'd all love Brother
[1:44:10] Brandham to be here. But guess what? If
[1:44:11] he was here, we'd close our churches.
[1:44:13] We'd all move to his church. No, we
[1:44:15] wouldn't have no pastors and no other
[1:44:17] brothers. God knew what he was doing
[1:44:19] when he took his prophet home
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; because he knew that as long as Elijah
[1:44:24] was waiting Elisha was waiting for
[1:44:26] Elijah. Then what could Elijah? Now
[1:44:28] listen, Elisha is not going to be
[1:44:31] Elijah. It's amazing. He was never going
[1:44:33] to actually repeat the same miracles
[1:44:36] that Elijah. So God didn't want him
[1:44:38] going to hold a tent, you know, and and
[1:44:40] and all of these kind of things and try
[1:44:42] to do the same miracles and have the
[1:44:44] same gift of discernment. Listen, none
[1:44:46] of us will ever have the gifts that
[1:44:48] Brother Brandham had in his ministry.
[1:44:49] God did it for a certain reason.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I said God did it for a certain reason.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; But let me just say to you, none of
[1:44:57] those gifts was what really attracts the
[1:44:59] bride. It wasn't the miracles. It wasn't
[1:45:01] the healing. It wasn't even the blind
[1:45:03] eyes. It wasn't the deaf ears. I'm
[1:45:06] thankful to God for all of those things.
[1:45:08] I'm thankful for the miracles. I I
[1:45:10] believe in miracles. But can I tell you
[1:45:12] that when he went to Sabino Canyon, the
[1:45:14] B the the the the the voice spoke to him
[1:45:17] and said, "This is the vindication of
[1:45:19] your ministry." It wasn't miracles. It
[1:45:21] wasn't signs. It wasn't wonders. It was
[1:45:24] a sword. And brother Brandham says,
[1:45:25] "What is this? This is the word of the
[1:45:28] Lord." Listen, I'm thankful for all of
[1:45:31] the miraculous, but the vindication of
[1:45:33] this message is that it's Jesus Christ,
[1:45:36] the same as he was in the Bible when he
[1:45:39] walked on the shores of Galilee. what
[1:45:41] came back to the earth again in the
[1:45:43] ministry of a prophet.
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; And so Elijah's Elisha is not going to
[1:45:51] repeat the same things, but he takes him
[1:45:54] very intentionally to these to these
[1:45:57] cities. And it's amazing because you
[1:46:00] notice this here. He asks him this
[1:46:02] question. What do you need, Elisha?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; What do you say, Elisha? Whatever you
[1:46:08] say. It's a powerful thing to me when
[1:46:11] you think about this because fear has a
[1:46:13] connection. You could watch this in
[1:46:15] brother Brandham's prayer lines even in
[1:46:17] some of his meetings and he would talk
[1:46:19] about how that he would preach and he
[1:46:21] said what was that? He said a demon
[1:46:23] screamed
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and he said then a demon from over here
[1:46:26] screamed. What's that demon doing? It's
[1:46:28] looking for help. It's trying to make a
[1:46:30] connection. You remember brother Brandon
[1:46:32] talking about this?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; And and the prophet of God says,
[1:46:35] "Sister, the same thing that's wrong
[1:46:37] with you is wrong with that sister over
[1:46:39] there." And he says, "And this sister
[1:46:41] was about to get free. So that demon
[1:46:44] spirit begin to cry out asking for
[1:46:46] help." And notice, he says, "And there's
[1:46:49] a dark streak or a line that is
[1:46:52] connecting this with this demon with
[1:46:54] this demon." And he says, "Oh, how I
[1:46:56] only wish that my lovely audience could
[1:46:59] be in this dimension to see that." So
[1:47:01] what a prophet does is he peers into a
[1:47:04] realm of the unseen of the dimension
[1:47:06] that we have no, you know, even here
[1:47:08] would never want to see. Honestly, some
[1:47:09] of the things brother Brandon describes,
[1:47:11] I wouldn't want to ever see.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Be honest.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon begins to tell us
[1:47:18] how that fear had a connection and that
[1:47:20] one spirit or demon was crying to help
[1:47:22] for another. That's why depression loves
[1:47:25] depression.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. You know
[1:47:28] what the devil will do? He'll take
[1:47:30] something in your life that is bothering
[1:47:32] you and he'll bring somebody else with
[1:47:34] the same spirit, with the same struggle,
[1:47:37] with the same problem and connects you
[1:47:39] with them
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; because he knows that company demon
[1:47:43] spirits, misery loves company.
[1:47:47] What you ought to do is recognize the
[1:47:49] devil and his tactics and realize you
[1:47:52] got to you got to find a friend that
[1:47:53] that has had victory over the same thing
[1:47:56] you're struggling with and say, "I'm
[1:47:58] going to surround myself with someone
[1:48:00] who God has has given them victory in
[1:48:02] their life." Don't put yourself around
[1:48:04] somebody else that has the same
[1:48:05] problems. Connect yourself with somebody
[1:48:08] that has faith that has that has uh God
[1:48:10] has worked in their life to overcome
[1:48:12] that spirit.
[1:48:14] Now, I want to tell you something here
[1:48:16] tonight. If fear has a connection, then
[1:48:18] faith has a connection, too.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you're a man. Start charging
[1:48:24] someone else's faith to pull on the word
[1:48:26] of God.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't don't you I'm just going to
[1:48:29] preach what the Bible says. The Bible
[1:48:31] says Paul and Silas were in a prison
[1:48:33] bound by chains, right?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that they started
[1:48:37] praising God. What were they doing? They
[1:48:40] were creating the right atmosphere.
[1:48:42] You see, they didn't have no power
[1:48:44] within themselves to let their chain to
[1:48:46] to loose their chains. If they did, they
[1:48:48] would have. But they knew if they could
[1:48:50] and if they could summon an angel,
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; if they could summon another power
[1:48:54] stronger than them, so they start
[1:48:56] singing praises and him. But let me tell
[1:48:59] you what happened as they begin to sing
[1:49:01] in their darkness,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; in the midst of their trial, the Bible
[1:49:05] says that those chains that they were
[1:49:06] bound with suddenly were loosed.
[1:49:10] But you know what's so powerful about
[1:49:12] that? It wasn't just Paul and Silas who
[1:49:14] the Bible says went free, but actually
[1:49:16] the entire prison lost the the the devil
[1:49:19] lost a grip on the whole church. You see
[1:49:22] what happens when one person can break
[1:49:25] through in victory. When one person can
[1:49:27] get victory in the Holy Ghost, it'll
[1:49:30] break the chains in the church of the
[1:49:31] living God.
[1:49:34] That's why an atmosphere, brother
[1:49:36] Brandham tells us you create your own
[1:49:38] atmosphere.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Tells us another place that you operate
[1:49:44] the gift.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And so pulling on the word of God, the
[1:49:51] natural, the prophet of God says, types
[1:49:55] the supernatural.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And he says the natural and the
[1:49:59] supernatural run together.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Right? Hello.
[1:50:04] And so now notice this question. What
[1:50:06] what what will you have me to do? Now
[1:50:08] watch how Elijah takes him to these
[1:50:10] cities. Here was Jericho. This was a
[1:50:12] city that was on that time at the days
[1:50:14] of Elijah's ministry was on fire. They
[1:50:17] were in revival. You know what God did
[1:50:19] in the city of Jericho with Rahab. And
[1:50:21] then he takes him to Bethl. This is
[1:50:23] where Jacob dreams a dream. And the
[1:50:26] scripture says he wakes up from out of
[1:50:28] his sleep and says, "Surely the Lord was
[1:50:30] in this place and I knew it not." This
[1:50:33] is none other than the house of God. And
[1:50:36] he names the name of that place, Bethl.
[1:50:38] What was it? And the ministry of Elijah
[1:50:40] at the beginning of his ministry, they
[1:50:43] were on fire. Revival fires were
[1:50:45] burning. Bethl was also a city. Jordan,
[1:50:48] we know is where Joshua crosses over uh
[1:50:51] uh uh the Jordan River. And we know the
[1:50:53] victory. But oh, how different was these
[1:50:56] cities from the early stages of Elijah's
[1:51:00] ministry to the ending when he's about
[1:51:03] to go home.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Now, those same cities are mocking the
[1:51:08] prophet,
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; called him old body
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; and it's young people. Listen to me,
[1:51:13] friends. I believe it's no different
[1:51:15] today. People love the ministry of
[1:51:17] brother Brandon when he was, you know,
[1:51:18] with the blind eyes were being open and
[1:51:20] miracles. They all wanted him in their
[1:51:22] meetings. Come to our tent. let's hold a
[1:51:24] revival.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; But when he came to his real ministry,
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; he comes to what house will you build
[1:51:32] me? And said, I never want to start a
[1:51:33] church. I never wanted to start a church
[1:51:35] here in Tucson, but I sat here for eight
[1:51:37] months and you wouldn't have me preach
[1:51:39] in your pull pits. They had closed the
[1:51:41] doors
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; to Christ
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and put him out of his own church.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; This was the ministry of Christ. That's
[1:51:52] right.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And now those same cities are mocking
[1:51:54] the prophet of God. Don't want anything
[1:51:56] to do with him.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; You know that Perry Green said the
[1:52:00] reason he started a church, this is in
[1:52:02] his own testimony, the reason he started
[1:52:04] the Tucson Tabernacle, he said because I
[1:52:07] wanted a church where I could say the
[1:52:09] name William Brandom and it wouldn't
[1:52:11] offend anybody.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine if Brother Brandham
[1:52:16] could see us today? We have churches
[1:52:18] across the globe that not only are we
[1:52:21] not ashamed to say the name William
[1:52:23] Brandom, we are identified with that
[1:52:26] messenger. That's why the voices of
[1:52:28] thousands of people said we are resting
[1:52:31] upon that.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; What was it? Our life I our testimony is
[1:52:36] resting upon this. You preached what
[1:52:38] Paul preached.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And the same ministry that was in the
[1:52:42] first age comes back at the last age
[1:52:44] again.
[1:52:47] And now these same cities that were in
[1:52:50] revival now have closed the door.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And and and Elijah brings him. You you
[1:52:56] notice some of the most powerful things
[1:52:57] that took place. I just want to show you
[1:52:59] here for a moment. Look at Joshua. If
[1:53:01] you have your Bible, Joshua chapter 4.
[1:53:03] Can we just turn there here for a
[1:53:04] minute? I I I I just want to catch this
[1:53:06] and not miss it. The Lord just brought
[1:53:08] this to to me just now. So I just want
[1:53:10] to make sure we don't miss this. Notice
[1:53:12] what happens here. And here's Jordan.
[1:53:15] Came to pass when all the people were
[1:53:16] clean passed over Jordan that the Lord
[1:53:18] spake unto Joshua. Now notice what's
[1:53:20] going to happen. They're about to cross
[1:53:21] Jordan. Now remember, Jordan represents
[1:53:24] sin.
[1:53:26] It represents death,
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; It's so amazing when you look at how
[1:53:32] different this was from the days when
[1:53:35] when Moses, the prophet of God, crosses
[1:53:38] the Red Sea. Jordan's very much
[1:53:39] different than the Red Sea. Here you got
[1:53:41] a prophet of God, you know, the Ten
[1:53:43] Commandments displays it very perfectly.
[1:53:45] And you got Moses and he's got the staff
[1:53:48] and and the lightning, you know, uh uh
[1:53:50] you know, flashing and and here's this
[1:53:52] great big old sea and this great big old
[1:53:54] water. And God says, "Why cry unto me?
[1:53:57] Speak and let the children of Israel go
[1:53:59] forward." And Moses comes to the water,
[1:54:01] a prophet, and and he plants the staff
[1:54:03] in in the Red Sea. And and the David
[1:54:05] said it this way, the water stood up as
[1:54:07] two heaps.
[1:54:09] And here they are in this great, you
[1:54:12] know, granduous uh great ocean. But
[1:54:15] here's Joshua and it's not that at all.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Now you don't have no prophet. You don't
[1:54:19] have no Moses,
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; but you have the ministry of Joshua.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; And now you have 12 priests who
[1:54:28] Levitical priests who God is going to
[1:54:30] use this crossing also different than
[1:54:33] how they came out of Egypt.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; It's the Jordan River now. It's swelled
[1:54:38] up. It's flooded. It's higher than it's
[1:54:40] ever been. But it's no nothing looks the
[1:54:42] same as when Moses crossed the Red Sea.
[1:54:45] But yet God, the same God who parted the
[1:54:48] Red Sea is about to part the Jordan
[1:54:50] River.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And he's not going to use a Moses. He's
[1:54:55] going to use the 12 men. This is what
[1:54:57] your Bible says. He's going to use
[1:54:59] Levites under the ministry of the Holy
[1:55:02] Ghost. Oh, I wish you'd preach with me.
[1:55:04] Come on. Come on.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, God says, "I'm not
[1:55:07] going to do it the same way you crossed
[1:55:09] the Red Sea, but I'm going to use
[1:55:12] ministry.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to use a man from each tribe."
[1:55:18] And so God says, "I want you," notice
[1:55:20] here in verse two, let's read it here.
[1:55:22] He says, "Take you 12 men of the people,
[1:55:25] out of every tribe, a man. command them,
[1:55:28] saying, "Take you hints out of the midst
[1:55:30] of Jordan." Notice, out of the place
[1:55:33] where the priest's feet stood firm. I
[1:55:36] love the way the Bible says that.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, they weren't
[1:55:39] wishy-washy.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; They weren't a jellyfish.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; But my Bible says they stood firm.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a it's it's something
[1:55:47] different when you're standing, you
[1:55:48] know, sort of not knowing really where
[1:55:50] you stand on how your holiness and how
[1:55:52] you should dress and what are you know,
[1:55:54] all of these kind of this is the world
[1:55:56] we live in, friends. It's a wishy-washy
[1:55:57] world. Ain't nobody got any standards
[1:56:00] anymore. They're afraid to preach the
[1:56:02] gospel.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; They're they're afraid to hurt anybody's
[1:56:07] feelings. Afraid to step on anybody's
[1:56:08] toes.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; You know, you got to modernize it. Don't
[1:56:11] say it the way Brother Brandham said it
[1:56:12] cuz it might hurt somebody's feelings.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; You know, water it down some a little
[1:56:16] bit, Brother Matt. Dumb it down some.
[1:56:18] Don't you know this is the Antichrist
[1:56:20] spirit that Brother Brandham said would
[1:56:22] come into the church. That antichrist
[1:56:24] spirit was never there to make us a
[1:56:26] bunch of word rejectors. He knows he's
[1:56:28] not going to get anybody to shut to turn
[1:56:30] the a true minister of God to, you know,
[1:56:32] to turn the message away. That wasn't
[1:56:34] the goal of the antichrist. It was to
[1:56:36] water the word down
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; to make it lose its effect.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; And they're afraid to say anything. Oh,
[1:56:45] don't want to hurt anybody's feelings.
[1:56:46] Don't want to hurt the, you know, the
[1:56:47] the famous person over here. Don't want
[1:56:49] to, you know, you know, don't want to
[1:56:50] step on anybody's toes.
[1:56:56] Yeah. I got a friend back home and he
[1:56:57] said, "Yeah, one of his my favorite
[1:56:59] statements." He said, "Feelings are
[1:57:00] overrated.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Put that on a t-shirt and wear it
[1:57:05] somewhere." I said, "Feelings? I just
[1:57:07] got news for you. I I want to tell the
[1:57:09] ministry in this last day, brother.
[1:57:11] Don't worry about my feelings. Tell me
[1:57:13] the truth. I want to know the word, what
[1:57:16] the word says. Don't worry about whether
[1:57:18] it hurt somebody's feelings. Just preach
[1:57:20] it the way God said it." And I believe
[1:57:23] there's a people that say, "Preach the
[1:57:24] word of God. Preach it the way a prophet
[1:57:27] spoke it. Don't water it down, brother.
[1:57:29] Don't try to worry about my feelings.
[1:57:31] Just say it the way God told you to say
[1:57:33] it."
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Their feet stood firm.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Now, notice this here. He says, "Take
[1:57:39] you out of each place, the midst of the
[1:57:41] Jordan, out of the place where the
[1:57:43] priest's feet stood firm, 12 stones."
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And notice what he's going to do with
[1:57:48] these stones. And you shall carry them
[1:57:50] with you. leave them in the lodging
[1:57:51] place where you shall lodge this night.
[1:57:53] Verse four, Joshua called the 12 men.
[1:57:56] Verse 5, and he then he goes down to
[1:57:58] verse six and says, "That may be a sign
[1:58:02] among you that when your notice,
[1:58:05] children,
[1:58:07] ask their fathers."
[1:58:10] Come on, message believers. Anytime you
[1:58:12] see children and fathers, you ought to
[1:58:14] catch something there because my Bible
[1:58:16] says he shall turn the hearts of the
[1:58:19] children back to the faith of the
[1:58:21] fathers. And now Joshua is saying that
[1:58:24] this may be a sign that when your
[1:58:27] children, oh, when children begin to
[1:58:29] look back in the word and say, "Where's
[1:58:31] the God of the Bible? Where's the God of
[1:58:33] the supernatural? Where's the God I read
[1:58:35] about that work through Moses and worked
[1:58:37] through Daniel? What was it?" children
[1:58:40] would begin to get hungry for a revival
[1:58:42] and say, "Where's the God we read
[1:58:44] about?"
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; And notice, God was not going to leave
[1:58:48] it though were great. Though the though
[1:58:50] the the fathers and elders were great,
[1:58:52] he wasn't going to leave it just a story
[1:58:55] that a dad told or a mom told or a
[1:58:58] grandpa told. Stories are wonderful,
[1:59:00] brother, but you've got to have your own
[1:59:02] revelation.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; You can't have a story just that you
[1:59:05] heard about. And so God says, "These
[1:59:08] stones,"
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; in other words, it will be these rein
[1:59:13] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:59:16] will literally
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:59:22] the faith of the fathers.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Take you 12 stones that
[1:59:29] this may be a sign." When they say,
[1:59:31] "What menu you when they ask?" Notice
[1:59:34] this here in verse six. What mean you
[1:59:36] buy these stones? Then you shall answer
[1:59:39] the waters of Jordan were cut off before
[1:59:41] the ark of the covenant of the Lord.
[1:59:43] When you when when it passed over
[1:59:44] Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut
[1:59:46] off. And these stones shall be for a
[1:59:50] memorial unto the children of Israel
[1:59:53] forever.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; What were these stones going to
[1:59:57] represent? Where the feet of the fathers
[2:00:00] stood. Yeah.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; I said we're the feet
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; of the fathers.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Stood firm.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; And it would be us turning back to the
[2:00:14] faith of the apostolic,
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; not Isuza, not 1906,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; not just a work of not just Pentecost.
[2:00:22] Brother Brandham said that wasn't even
[2:00:24] really true. Pentec the restoration of
[2:00:25] Pentecost. If that wasn't, what do you
[2:00:27] think this is? The prophet of God said
[2:00:30] it over and over and over that's replete
[2:00:32] throughout the message that the message
[2:00:34] of the hour of Malachi 4 was to turn the
[2:00:38] faith of you back to the faith of the
[2:00:41] original apostolic fathers.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Can I preach what a prophet preached?
[2:00:46] There is one standard. There is no other
[2:00:49] standard. There's one pattern. There is
[2:00:51] no other pattern. What the church was on
[2:00:54] the day of Pentecost is the standard.
[2:00:57] That is the pattern.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I go a little further? No matter
[2:01:02] that scholars tell you the apostolic age
[2:01:04] is over, don't you believe it? As long
[2:01:07] as God is calling men to preach the
[2:01:09] gospel, there's still an apostolic age.
[2:01:12] And brother, I want to tell you with the
[2:01:14] restoration of the apostolic word would
[2:01:17] come apostolic power in the Holy Ghost
[2:01:20] to defeat the devil in your life.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's not a time to go backwards.
[2:01:25] This ain't a time to to water it down.
[2:01:27] It's a time to preach it and to go
[2:01:29] forward. Like brother David said, not
[2:01:32] for fear or favor of men, but preach the
[2:01:35] word of God.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; And notice he says, "Take these stones
[2:01:42] where the priest's feet stood firm."
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; And so these men walk over to Jordan.
[2:01:47] You imagine what they're feeling like.
[2:01:50] Couldn't a prophet come? Could Couldn't
[2:01:52] Couldn't God send? This is death. I
[2:01:54] mean, this is the B. This is the
[2:01:55] translation.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; If if we don't cross here, what's the
[2:01:59] purpose of God even taking us out of
[2:02:00] Egypt?
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine? What do you mean,
[2:02:04] God? You want me to do it?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; God says, "Take each man." Come on,
[2:02:07] Joshua. You could do it. No. God says,
[2:02:10] "You got a part to play in this."
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost is going to do it,
[2:02:14] but he's going to do it through men.
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[2:02:18] that the Bible was written by holy men
[2:02:20] of God who were moved by the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:23] God wasn't going to take his finger and
[2:02:24] write it. He was going to put it in the
[2:02:26] mouths of men and their words would
[2:02:29] become what you read in a Bible.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; But it's not the words of man. It's the
[2:02:33] words of the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, Joshua. You could do it. No. He
[2:02:39] says, "Levi, I need a man. Dad, I need a
[2:02:41] man. Reuben, give me a man. Simeon, give
[2:02:44] me a man. Benjamin, give me a man." And
[2:02:47] out of each one of the tribes would be a
[2:02:51] man that would represent that entire
[2:02:53] tribe.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And the scripture says they walk into
[2:02:56] Jordan. And now this is very different.
[2:02:58] No staff. But the scripture says, "And
[2:03:01] when the souls of the priest feet,
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; footsteps mean
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; when they touch, not when they think
[2:03:10] about it,
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; not when they contemplate it,
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; but you've got to put action to your
[2:03:15] faith.
[2:03:18] When they put their foot in the Jordan,
[2:03:20] Jordan will part just a little bit.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; And then they put another, then it parts
[2:03:26] a little more.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Then they put another and it parts a
[2:03:28] little more. And before you know it,
[2:03:30] there's a highway.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; And you have Gad here. You have a man
[2:03:35] for Reuben here. Listen. Listen. Come
[2:03:37] here, brother. Let me use all four of
[2:03:38] you. All look perfect here tonight. I
[2:03:40] want you to notice what Notice what he
[2:03:41] does there. Come here, brother David. I
[2:03:43] want you to face this brother right
[2:03:44] here. And come here, brother. Come here,
[2:03:46] brother. Brother, you stay there. Stay
[2:03:47] here. Now, this is just four, but I want
[2:03:49] you to imagine because this is the
[2:03:50] picture that your Bible paints for you.
[2:03:53] This is how, listen, not them coming out
[2:03:55] of Egypt, but this is how they cross
[2:03:57] over Jordan.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; And God says, this is how we're going to
[2:04:02] cross. That the ministry will stand in
[2:04:05] the gap.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; That the ministry will stand in the
[2:04:10] Jordan.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Now, listen. Jordan is full of it's it's
[2:04:14] a it's representative of death. It's
[2:04:16] representative of fear. And they stand
[2:04:18] there with their feet. Listen, planted
[2:04:20] firm
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; because the rest of the tribes, the rest
[2:04:25] of the people are going to so depend
[2:04:28] upon their stand
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; that they're not wishy-washy,
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; that they're not jellyfish, that they're
[2:04:37] not questioning Jo Joshua. Come on,
[2:04:40] somebody. that they're not questioning
[2:04:42] Moses,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; but it will be their stand. And the
[2:04:47] Bible says as long as they stay in the
[2:04:48] water, Jordan will part. And so, mother,
[2:04:51] father, little babies,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; they begin to cross
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; through the other side with the voices
[2:04:58] of the ministry on either side, taking a
[2:05:01] stand for the word of God.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:05:05] Yes, sir.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; And as long as they stay in Jordan and
[2:05:09] stay standing for the word,
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; then Jordan has to stay out of people's
[2:05:15] lives.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; But I got a question for you. What would
[2:05:20] happen?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; What would happen, brother,
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; if these men put their Bibles down like
[2:05:25] some people want them to do?
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; What would happen if these men stopped
[2:05:30] preaching the word of God?
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. What would happen if
[2:05:34] they okay, not preached, but what would
[2:05:36] happen if they started watering it down?
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; What would happen and say, you know, we
[2:05:40] really don't have to stand with my foot
[2:05:42] firm like that. You know, I think that
[2:05:44] was I think that was Joshua's opinion.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; I know that what year was that? Was it
[2:05:51] after 63 or before 63?
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; You know, why do we got to say, brother
[2:05:57] Brandham said, and brother Brandham,
[2:05:59] aren't we ever going to get past quoting
[2:06:01] a prophet?
[2:06:04] I had a brother tell me that. Brother
[2:06:05] Matthew said, "Aren't you ever going to
[2:06:06] get past quoting a prophet?" I said,
[2:06:07] "Buddy, you if you're waiting for me to
[2:06:09] stop saying, Brother Brandham said, you
[2:06:10] better just go ahead and give up now."
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, why do we got to quote a
[2:06:15] prophet?" I said, "Well, let me just
[2:06:16] tell you what I believe. Jesus quoted a
[2:06:18] prophet
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; and said that it might be fulfilled the
[2:06:21] word spoken by Isaiah." Yes, sir.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist quoted a prophet. Paul
[2:06:27] quoted prophets. And I believe it's my
[2:06:30] liberty to say what a prophet said.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; What would happen if they started
[2:06:41] questioning? Well, that was just Brother
[2:06:43] Baron's opinion. Don't you see how
[2:06:45] important it is
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; that we stand firm?
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; You see what would happen if these
[2:06:53] brothers stepped out of the Jordan?
[2:06:57] Jordan would begin to creep in our
[2:06:59] churches.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Sin would become to the to our churches,
[2:07:03] to our families. We'd look no different
[2:07:05] than the mega church down the street.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; What would happen if they stopped and
[2:07:09] compromised on the word of God? Who
[2:07:11] would be at risk? You, your children,
[2:07:13] your family. Oh, I say like never
[2:07:16] before, you ought to thank God for a
[2:07:18] minister that will tell you the truth.
[2:07:20] You ought to say, "Pastor, stay in
[2:07:23] Jordan. Don't compromise this word of
[2:07:25] God. You ought to thank God that God put
[2:07:28] a man over your life that stands for the
[2:07:30] word of God.
[2:07:32] Thank you, brothers.
[2:07:35] I'm going to tell you what, I preached
[2:07:36] that to a church in Honduras. Brother
[2:07:38] David, I was there and I got to be
[2:07:39] careful even how I say this because I
[2:07:41] wouldn't want to be careful because
[2:07:43] there's I was there just just last year
[2:07:47] and and and I didn't know I was there
[2:07:49] preaching for multiple churches. I think
[2:07:52] I preached at I forget how many it was,
[2:07:54] six or seven. And the pastor was a
[2:07:55] wonderful pastor. He took me around. I
[2:07:57] didn't know where I was preaching the
[2:07:58] next night, where it would be and take
[2:08:00] me to there and take me here and and the
[2:08:02] next service was just another church I
[2:08:04] was going to and we're going to go there
[2:08:06] and and this big city and I'm going to
[2:08:08] preach for these believers. And so I'm
[2:08:10] just praying about what I preach, Lord.
[2:08:12] What what would you have me say? I don't
[2:08:13] even know. You know, it seemed like the
[2:08:15] Lord has given me something different.
[2:08:16] And no matter where I went, God would
[2:08:18] just give me something a need to to meet
[2:08:19] the need. And uh and so so the brother
[2:08:22] he he goes to he's a he's a teacher
[2:08:24] there and he he picks me up. I'm at the
[2:08:26] house all day just preparing really just
[2:08:28] torn between directions. And uh and he
[2:08:30] gets me there in the afternoon and we
[2:08:32] got about a two-hour car drive and it's
[2:08:34] me and him and the pastor's wife and
[2:08:36] we're driving there to that church and
[2:08:37] he says, "Brother Matt," he says, "Do
[2:08:39] you know what you're going to preach on
[2:08:40] tonight?" I said, "No, brother." I said,
[2:08:43] "I've just really honestly I'm I'm
[2:08:45] really just praying. I got I I just I'm
[2:08:47] struggling to find the mind of the Lord.
[2:08:49] You just pray for me." He said, "Okay,
[2:08:50] okay, brother." And about that time, the
[2:08:53] Holy Spirit just dropped in my heart
[2:08:55] with a sermon that I hadn't preached in
[2:08:57] a very long time. Didn't have it
[2:08:59] anywhere on my in my notes that I had
[2:09:00] prepared for even for that trip. And I
[2:09:03] stopped and I said, "I got it. That's
[2:09:04] it." And he says, "You have it?" I said,
[2:09:06] "I got it, brother." I said, "The Lord
[2:09:08] just gave it to me. I know what I'm
[2:09:09] going to preach."
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What's the title?" I said,
[2:09:12] "Well, the title is the truth shall make
[2:09:16] you free.
[2:09:20] because that's what your Bible says.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say the truth will. It says the
[2:09:25] truth will make you free.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; And and and he he he quotes he says yes.
[2:09:32] And he says my two opening scriptures.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; And I thought, my goodness, how did that
[2:09:38] brother know what my scriptures were?
[2:09:40] And it was my two scriptures I was going
[2:09:42] to read out of John. We get to that
[2:09:44] church. And so I just begin to prepare
[2:09:46] and there's about three or 4 hundred
[2:09:47] believers there. big old building, you
[2:09:49] know, and and just really long. Just
[2:09:51] seemed like it was just a really really
[2:09:53] long just a lot of believers. And they
[2:09:55] sing, "I don't know nobody. Don't know
[2:09:56] no nothing. Didn't don't know anything."
[2:09:58] And just there to preach. I knew what I
[2:10:00] was going to preach. I walk out to the
[2:10:01] platform and I read my opening text. And
[2:10:04] that brother had been interpreting me
[2:10:05] that entire trip, but he was a different
[2:10:07] man in that service. In fact, at one
[2:10:10] point, he was so anointed, he almost
[2:10:12] knew what I was going to say before I
[2:10:14] started wondering who's the translator
[2:10:15] and who's the preacher. I'm serious. You
[2:10:18] laugh, but he was standing on my right
[2:10:20] when I started. About midway through, he
[2:10:22] was here and I was on his right.
[2:10:26] And he's so preaching it with such
[2:10:28] passion. And in that sermon, I I I spend
[2:10:30] a lot of time about what is truth and
[2:10:32] the truth that's been restored and how
[2:10:34] important it is that we speak the truth
[2:10:36] because it's only the truth can set you
[2:10:38] free.
[2:10:38] &gt;&gt; And you can't dance around it. You can't
[2:10:40] worry about what people will think. You
[2:10:42] just got to sometimes you just got to
[2:10:43] speak it.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; And and and I begin to preach that and I
[2:10:48] use that same example out of what we
[2:10:50] just now read here in Joshua 4. And I
[2:10:53] and and I wanted to use that example. So
[2:10:55] I called out four men out of that church
[2:10:58] randomly. I just said, "You, brother,
[2:11:00] you brother, you." And then I looked at
[2:11:02] the very back. There's a brother. I
[2:11:03] said, "You, brother." He said, "Me?" I
[2:11:05] said, "Yeah, come here. Come here." So
[2:11:06] he comes up and I I use the same exact
[2:11:09] example, brother Matthew, with those
[2:11:10] brothers and I put my arm over on one of
[2:11:12] them as I just now did just now said I
[2:11:14] said what would happen if these brothers
[2:11:16] started questioning saying we don't need
[2:11:18] to quote a prophet we don't need to know
[2:11:19] what say what brother Brandham said and
[2:11:22] the church all I know is at that moment
[2:11:24] a volcano erupted in that building
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; and that church just was like an
[2:11:28] earthquake and I thought my goodness I
[2:11:30] don't even know what happened. I get out
[2:11:32] to the car and and and the brother tells
[2:11:34] me as soon as they close the door, his
[2:11:36] wife starts sobbing. Says, "Brother, you
[2:11:39] have to tell brother Matt now." He said,
[2:11:40] "Brother Matt, I want to tell you that
[2:11:42] what happened tonight was nothing other
[2:11:44] than God, a supernatural God meeting a
[2:11:47] need." He said, "This morning at 5:00 in
[2:11:49] the morning, the Lord woke me up and he
[2:11:51] said, I started just to talk to the Lord
[2:11:53] and say, Lord, I want to I want to
[2:11:54] translate brother Matt well tonight. I
[2:11:56] want to do a good job." And he says,
[2:11:58] 'Lord, I want to I want to be direct me
[2:12:00] to a sermon that he's preached that I
[2:12:02] could hear during the day and translate
[2:12:03] it at school. And he said, "So I went on
[2:12:05] your website. I scrolled through page
[2:12:07] one, page two, page three. Randomly, I
[2:12:09] selected the sermon you preached
[2:12:11] tonight."
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; And he said, "So I knew everything you
[2:12:15] were going to say before you even said
[2:12:17] it."
[2:12:20] Hallelujah.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And brother Matt, I was
[2:12:23] determined not to say anything to you,
[2:12:25] but this church was my greatest need,
[2:12:27] was my greatest burden because the
[2:12:29] pastor who was a pastor for years has
[2:12:32] got dementia and he's he's he's uh not
[2:12:34] the pastor anymore." And they're sort of
[2:12:36] in a in a low there looking for a
[2:12:38] pastor. And he says, "And four men have
[2:12:41] have came in and they're trying to move
[2:12:43] the church out of the message." And
[2:12:45] they're starting to say things like,
[2:12:46] "Why do we need to quote brother
[2:12:48] Brandaman? Why do we need to emphasize
[2:12:50] brother Brandaman? Why do we need to
[2:12:51] emphasize a prophet? It's all about
[2:12:53] Jesus. Just preach Jesus." Well, I got a
[2:12:55] question. Which Jesus do you want me to
[2:12:57] preach?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; People say, "Just give me Jesus." I tell
[2:13:00] you what they're wanting. They're
[2:13:01] wanting their imagination, Jesus.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; They're wanting just their own version
[2:13:06] of Jesus.
[2:13:08] Well, just let me preach Jesus. Let me
[2:13:10] tell you something, brother. You say,
[2:13:11] "Oh, had I been there in the days of
[2:13:13] Jesus, I would have never uh been with
[2:13:15] the crowd that crucified him. I wouldn't
[2:13:17] have been with that crowd saying
[2:13:18] crucify." I would have stood for him. I
[2:13:21] would have defended him. But I tell you
[2:13:22] what a prophet said. A prophet said,
[2:13:24] "I'll tell you what you would have done
[2:13:26] then. You show me what you do for your
[2:13:28] word, for your day and its message."
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Brother, I just say it like I believe
[2:13:34] it. What you do with this message is
[2:13:36] what you do with Jesus Christ.
[2:13:40] [Applause]
[2:13:42] And and and that brother said, "What
[2:13:43] would you?" He said, "Brother Matt," he
[2:13:44] said, "you sat there saying," he said,
[2:13:47] "Those," he said, "you see," he said,
[2:13:48] "you don't know it, but those four
[2:13:50] brothers," and he said, "Are saying we
[2:13:51] don't need to quote a prophet." He said,
[2:13:53] "Brother Matt, those were the four
[2:13:55] brothers you picked randomly."
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; I tell you what it is, brother, sister.
[2:14:01] God defends his own words.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; I said God will defend his own words.
[2:14:10] God is the great shepherd of the sheep.
[2:14:13] Oh, you ought to give God praise. He
[2:14:15] defends you even when you you don't even
[2:14:17] know you're under attack. But God's
[2:14:19] angels are watching over you. God's
[2:14:21] angels are protecting you. God's angels
[2:14:24] are keeping you. Hallelujah.
[2:14:27] I say if God could protect his word in
[2:14:30] in in Honduras, how much more can he
[2:14:32] protect it in my own life?
[2:14:39] Why, brother Matt? Because he's a
[2:14:40] supernatural God.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; I said he's a supernatural God.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; You imagine the burden that was on
[2:14:49] Elijah as he wants to pass down the
[2:14:52] expectation, the faith. He can't. He's
[2:14:56] his impression that he leaves on Elisha
[2:14:58] would determine the next generation.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; So he wants to pass down the right
[2:15:04] things. He wants to let Elisha know
[2:15:07] Elisha, the same God that was with me
[2:15:09] will be with you. That's what God had to
[2:15:12] tell Joshua. As I was with Moses, so
[2:15:14] shall I be with you.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; And so what what was on brother
[2:15:18] Brandham's heart? Really, what was on
[2:15:20] his heart? Is the past down the right
[2:15:23] thing to believe? Listen, friends, I'm
[2:15:25] just going to go ahead and preach it
[2:15:26] here for a moment. Uh this is not the
[2:15:28] time to stop believing in the
[2:15:30] supernatural. This is not the time to
[2:15:32] stop preaching about a supernatural God
[2:15:35] who when doctors say it's impossible, my
[2:15:38] God says I'll have the last word over
[2:15:40] your life. When doubt and fear says
[2:15:43] you're not going to make it.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach here tonight.
[2:15:48] That voice of depression has talked to
[2:15:50] you for for years of your life and
[2:15:52] you've listened to that voice. What
[2:15:54] what's going to happen to your life?
[2:15:55] You're never going to make it. Your
[2:15:57] children are not going to be saved.
[2:15:58] You're going to lose everything. and you
[2:16:00] let the devil talk and talk and talk. I
[2:16:02] think it's time we shut the devil up and
[2:16:04] let the Holy Spirit start talking to our
[2:16:07] heart and say, "God, I'm tired of
[2:16:09] hearing his voice."
[2:16:12] [Applause]
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; You know, it's so powerful when I hear
[2:16:17] uh you heard the voices of many men, but
[2:16:19] my Bible says Jesus said, "But I say
[2:16:22] unto you." I'm not talking about what
[2:16:24] your depression is saying. I'm saying
[2:16:26] what is Jesus saying? Uh, the devil says
[2:16:28] you won't make it, but I say unto you.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; The devil says you'll never be enough.
[2:16:34] But I say unto you,
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; the words that I speak, they are spirit
[2:16:39] and they are life.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Adam says here. This
[2:16:43] is so powerful, brother. You can just
[2:16:45] display it. This is what the prophet of
[2:16:47] God says. I love this quote so much. We
[2:16:49] can preach the word, explain the word,
[2:16:52] but you have to receive the word.
[2:16:56] Oh, that's what sets it a fire, brother.
[2:16:59] When you receive it, how many want to
[2:17:01] receive it?
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; When you receive it, the revelation,
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; something
[2:17:07] slips out of the unseen world, yonder,
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; comes rolling down through a mystical
[2:17:13] channel somewhere into your soul that
[2:17:16] says, "Now I see it." Your eyes get
[2:17:19] brighter. Your lips that hung down
[2:17:21] straighten up and smile.
[2:17:23] every muscle in your body. Oh, you mean
[2:17:26] the word cannot just affect my spirit.
[2:17:29] It can actually affect my body.
[2:17:32] [Applause]
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:17:39] Listen, I believe God can more than uh
[2:17:41] give you a revelation down in your soul,
[2:17:43] but my Bible says that there's
[2:17:44] stimulation that comes with that
[2:17:46] revelation.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Adam says every muscle in your
[2:17:52] body
[2:17:53] seems to rejoice.
[2:17:57] &gt;&gt; Say, "My body?" Yeah. Brother Matt,
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; you mean God wants to move my body? Oh,
[2:18:02] yeah.
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; He wants to move every part of you. In
[2:18:05] fact, he wants to change your body
[2:18:06] someday.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; And I say, "The God who can change my
[2:18:09] body, I ought to give him liberty in my
[2:18:11] body right now. If you ain't giving him
[2:18:14] liberty now, how's he ever going to
[2:18:15] change it?"
[2:18:16] [Applause]
[2:18:19] He says, "Every muscle in your body
[2:18:21] rejoices,
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; sir."
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Revelation book of
[2:18:24] symbols. Angelic beings associate
[2:18:28] together.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you get that. Just drop down
[2:18:32] free. If you've got the Holy Spirit, how
[2:18:35] many is here tonight? I said if you got
[2:18:37] the Holy Spirit,
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; how many got the Holy Spirit?
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Then you're a candidate.
[2:18:46] for association
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; with the unseen world
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; and the supernatural.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Notice brother Adam says this further in
[2:18:58] his body has earthly contact with five
[2:19:00] senses. In his spirit he has contact
[2:19:02] with God through the Holy Ghost and the
[2:19:05] angels of God visits them and speaks
[2:19:10] with them.
[2:19:12] You mean that I can have more than
[2:19:14] demons speaking to me and visiting to
[2:19:16] me? I can have angels
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; speaking to me
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; and visiting me. Come on, somebody. This
[2:19:23] is your inheritance in the Holy Ghost.
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; You ain't got to settle for just a a
[2:19:29] doubt spirit, a spirit that always makes
[2:19:32] you doubt. You can say, "Let an angel
[2:19:34] come and minister to me to give me faith
[2:19:37] to believe the word of God."
[2:19:41] They're messengers sent from God to
[2:19:43] reveal. Then what have we got to be
[2:19:46] worried about?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; I got news for you. Jesus is here.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; His spirit is here.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; What happened just now?
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon stopped. Says, "What?
[2:20:05] What? What happened just now? I went
[2:20:08] into another world.
[2:20:10] It's an unseen world. We become so
[2:20:11] conscious of looking at one another like
[2:20:13] this. But there's an unseen world.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; And it's greater than anything you see.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; I said it's greater than anything you
[2:20:24] see.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; There's a lot we see. We see problems.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; We see impossibilities.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; We see years after years of struggle
[2:20:36] with the same problem. doesn't look like
[2:20:38] we've ever going to get the victory.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you tonight,
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; there's something greater in the room
[2:20:45] that's greater than anything you see.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Here's Christ.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Here's Christ in this world, in this
[2:20:57] building are evil spirits
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; in this building. Oh, yeah.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Trying to get you to say, "Oh, that
[2:21:06] preacher's just emotional. He's just
[2:21:07] worked up.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; He ain't got that ain't for you. That's
[2:21:10] for somebody else. Yeah. Those spirits,
[2:21:11] they come to church. They're the most
[2:21:13] faithful church members, pastors have.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Demons of doubt, demons of uh uh you
[2:21:18] know, of worry, demons of fear, demons
[2:21:20] of questions,
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; demons of distraction.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; I got news in this building. There's
[2:21:26] evil spirits. But I got better news.
[2:21:28] There's also Christians who are anointed
[2:21:32] and the angels of God encamped about
[2:21:35] them trying
[2:21:37] to energize them with faith.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; And I say, God, energize my faith here
[2:21:45] tonight.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Let me plug into a supernatural
[2:21:48] dimension.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't know about you, if you
[2:21:52] feel like I do. I'm so done and tired of
[2:21:54] a world that's dreary and fearful and
[2:21:57] war with Ukraine and your war with
[2:21:59] Russia, war over here. The world's
[2:22:01] falling apart. What's Trump doing?
[2:22:03] What's Putin? Listen, I I don't know
[2:22:05] about you, but I feel like I am
[2:22:06] disconnected. I have not that is not
[2:22:08] This is not my home. I'm just passing
[2:22:11] through. My treasures are laid up
[2:22:13] somewhere beyond the blue. And that
[2:22:16] ain't the news I listen to. But I'm
[2:22:18] hearing a different sound.
[2:22:22] I'm tuned into a different dimension.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; And in that dimension, there's angels.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Trying to energize my faith.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's demons. I I know that there
[2:22:36] are they're more bold. The devil,
[2:22:37] listen, is more bold than he has ever
[2:22:40] been before. You say, "Brother Matt, you
[2:22:41] are bold sometimes when you preach." You
[2:22:43] know why? Cuz I got four kids, some of
[2:22:45] them's teenagers, and they face a bold
[2:22:48] devil
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; who doesn't ask me. He doesn't get my
[2:22:51] permission. He doesn't negotiate with
[2:22:53] me. He just does whatever. He He tries
[2:22:56] everything he can to harm them and to
[2:22:58] and to and to attack them. So, I just
[2:23:00] figure if the devil's bold, I ought to
[2:23:02] be bold. I ought to have a bold faith
[2:23:05] and a bold voice to say, "You can't
[2:23:08] touch my children, Satan. You can't have
[2:23:11] them. Get your hands off of my family."
[2:23:15] Oh, something ought to rise up inside of
[2:23:17] you to say, "Satan, you might have had
[2:23:19] victory for years, but I'm standing up
[2:23:22] against you tonight.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; You can't have my family.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; You can't have my body, Satan."
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said he's more bold than
[2:23:32] he's ever been.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; His agenda is more bold, brother. It's
[2:23:36] out all out in the open. Brother
[2:23:38] Matthew, no matter where you look, demon
[2:23:40] spirits are more manifested now. that
[2:23:42] veil that stands between that realm of
[2:23:45] of hell and this realm of life has
[2:23:48] blended together
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; so much now that the prophet of God said
[2:23:51] it's like a hell on earth. What do you
[2:23:54] see when he goes to J C Penney and he
[2:23:56] sees those sisters come, those women,
[2:23:58] sorry, coming on the escalator with
[2:24:00] makeup. It was hell
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; coming to earth.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; And brother, if that was then, how much
[2:24:07] more
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; is hell here on earth?
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I got news for you. You face it. I face
[2:24:14] it. Our churches face it. Our children
[2:24:17] face it. A bold devil that doesn't stand
[2:24:20] in the closet. He doesn't hide
[2:24:22] subvertly. He doesn't do things
[2:24:24] subliminally anymore. He comes right out
[2:24:26] in your face and he manifest himself. I
[2:24:30] just happen to believe that there's a
[2:24:32] hell that can manifest itself boldly out
[2:24:35] in the open. I just happen to believe
[2:24:37] there's a heaven that wants to manifest
[2:24:40] itself and pour out his spirit.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; I could hear the words of a prophet,
[2:24:46] "When all hell cuts loose, all heaven
[2:24:49] turns loose.
[2:24:51] Listen
[2:24:55] what brother Adam says here. What house
[2:24:56] will you build me? Because these are
[2:24:58] some of the last words. I'm I'm not
[2:25:00] going to go very much longer. You got
[2:25:02] you can I have a few more minutes?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Say Elijah's leaving and he's you could
[2:25:11] feel the burden of this moment. What's
[2:25:13] he wanting to pass down? What's he
[2:25:15] wanting to say? Elijah some of his last
[2:25:19] words. You can go and read the last
[2:25:21] words of men like Abraham Lincoln. Go
[2:25:23] and read the last words of men like
[2:25:25] David even in the Bible. Records the
[2:25:27] last words of Solomon. It records the
[2:25:29] last words of Jacob. Records the last
[2:25:31] words of Joseph when he says, "Don't
[2:25:33] leave my bones here in Egypt." These are
[2:25:36] some of the last imparting things. He's
[2:25:39] wanting to transfer. He's wanting to
[2:25:41] pass down the right thing. He's leaving.
[2:25:45] and everything that his he represents at
[2:25:48] his faith. He he his testimony is going
[2:25:53] to affect that next generation. You
[2:25:55] could go back and scour the message as I
[2:25:58] have. And I thought, what is some of the
[2:26:00] last feelings of God's prophet before he
[2:26:04] leaves the scene? Notice this. What
[2:26:06] house will you build me? 1965, November
[2:26:08] 21st. If you feel, listen, I know that
[2:26:11] each of you, if you feel like I do, how
[2:26:14] did you feel, brother Brandon? I am so
[2:26:17] hungry to see the spirit of God moving.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; I just can't hardly stand it.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; You mean after the seals, after the
[2:26:28] feast of the trumpets,
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; after Here you are and you're still
[2:26:32] wanting more.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Give me more, Lord.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Give me more, Jesus. I'm so hungry for
[2:26:38] the spirit of God to move.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many feel that way tonight?
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; Just say yes, Lord.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; I am so hungry.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; I just can't hardly stand it.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; Some experiences I've had, I just up in
[2:26:55] the mountain just to feel that once
[2:26:56] again. That's something that when I was
[2:26:59] first saved, so glorious was so glorious
[2:27:02] to my heart. Listen to what he says here
[2:27:05] in the token 1963 11128. And I am
[2:27:09] looking, what were you looking for,
[2:27:11] brother Brandham? For a time of a
[2:27:14] breakforth.
[2:27:17] You mean not a time where we all sit
[2:27:18] around and get more intellectual, more
[2:27:20] smarter, understand the mysteries
[2:27:22] better, be able to put it on a
[2:27:23] chalkboard? Listen, I'm grateful for all
[2:27:25] of that. I thank God. I believe we ought
[2:27:27] to have the knowledge of the word. But I
[2:27:29] tell you what, brother Brandham said he
[2:27:30] was looking for. He said, "I'm looking
[2:27:32] for a time of a break forth of the
[2:27:34] spirit of God in these last days that
[2:27:37] we're now living in for another surge of
[2:27:41] the Holy Spirit." Oh, I'm speaking today
[2:27:44] and saying, "Surge Holy Ghost. Surge in
[2:27:47] my family. Surge in my children. Surge
[2:27:51] in my church. Oh God." He says, "For
[2:27:54] another surge, for a rapturing faith,
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; just before it comes,
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; what shall you do with this Jesus called
[2:28:04] the Christ?" The dynamics of this
[2:28:07] church. How many can say this church?
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; This church,
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; this church,
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; this church,
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; the dynamics of this church
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; will be a refilling
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; that we have worked in a small measure
[2:28:24] while the headstone is coming down to
[2:28:27] unite with the body. What's happening
[2:28:30] right now?
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; What's been happening for the past 50
[2:28:33] years?
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; The headstone has been coming down
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; to the body.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And what happens when the headstone
[2:28:41] comes down?
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Are we smarter? Are we better? More
[2:28:45] intellectual? More knowledge? No,
[2:28:48] brother. I'm going to tell you what
[2:28:49] happens when the headstone comes down.
[2:28:51] When the head and your body unite
[2:28:53] together, the full power of the Holy
[2:28:56] Ghost. I said the full power, not a
[2:29:00] partial power, not a power from 1906
[2:29:03] Isuza Street, but the full power
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; would raise her up.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Even the dead that's dead in Christ for
[2:29:13] hundreds of years
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; will rise in the beauty of holiness and
[2:29:18] take a flight to the skies.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; The dynamics is the Holy Spirit.
[2:29:29] I want you to watch this as I just bring
[2:29:31] this down to a close. And I want to make
[2:29:33] sure my burden that I that I come to my
[2:29:36] burden of my heart that God's saying,
[2:29:40] you've got to have the same faith,
[2:29:41] Elisha. The same.
[2:29:44] He says, "Give me a double portion."
[2:29:46] Justification was good. Sanctification
[2:29:48] was good. the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:29:51] on your flesh experiences miracles,
[2:29:53] signs, wonders.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; But you've got to move on further.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; You've got to move on further, Elijah.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; You got to keep coming, Elisha, because
[2:30:02] you got to cross the Jordan.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to come to the token life.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; And you see the difference with the
[2:30:10] token life is that it wasn't the token
[2:30:13] was not going to be an experience.
[2:30:15] Hello, somebody.
[2:30:17] The token was not just going to be an
[2:30:19] experience on your flesh.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Nor was it going to just be an
[2:30:23] intellectual knowledge, but the prophet
[2:30:26] says the token would be the literal life
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; coming back down on the worship
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; and when you have his life,
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; you have his nature.
[2:30:46] Hello.
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; When you have his life,
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; you have his gifts.
[2:30:52] [Music]
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; You see, when you have him, you have all
[2:30:57] of him.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; The literal life of Jesus Christ
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; means that you will love like Jesus.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; You'll have patience like Jesus.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; Your character, your nature. Come on,
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; brother goes beyond the curtain of time
[2:31:13] and he comes back and he says, "Oh my
[2:31:15] brother, my sister, whatever you do in
[2:31:18] this life,
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; get to a place
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; where you can know the seals." No,
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; where you could bre, you know, from
[2:31:25] front to back line everything, the vials
[2:31:27] and the trumpets and the that's all
[2:31:29] wonderful. But when he goes beyond the
[2:31:30] curtain of time, his burden to tell you
[2:31:32] was get to the place where you can love
[2:31:35] everybody,
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; even your enemy.
[2:31:39] Get to the place where you have perfect
[2:31:41] love. For nothing will enter there
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; without it.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Why? Because perfect love comes from the
[2:31:50] perfect sacrifice.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; That is the literal life
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; right
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; You have not only the fruits of the
[2:32:00] spirit,
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; you also have the gifts of the spirit.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Come on somebody.
[2:32:07] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 12. Brother Brandham said,
[2:32:08] "I'll show you where God put the gifts
[2:32:10] in the church. You show me where he took
[2:32:11] them out."
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Gifts is not the inheritance of
[2:32:14] Pentecost. Isuza Street. Gifts was the
[2:32:17] inheritance. The prophet of God says
[2:32:18] what the church had at Pentecost.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Can I preach to you what a prophet says?
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; And that is your inalienable right.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; You may have got a right
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; to the gifts of the spirit in operation
[2:32:32] in my life. Yeah. That's your right.
[2:32:34] Don't let a preacher, don't let a devil,
[2:32:37] don't let a spirit take it away from
[2:32:38] you. It is the right of the church of
[2:32:41] the living God
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; to have the full power, the full nature,
[2:32:48] the token life manifested.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's so amazing to me. I know I've
[2:32:53] preached on this before, but it's so
[2:32:55] amazing to me how that people always
[2:32:57] line up. I've always found, brother
[2:32:58] Matthew, that people will do one of two
[2:33:00] things. They'll either deify
[2:33:03] or they will deemphasize.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; And it's so amazing because people will
[2:33:08] prop up one thing, the gifts, the gifts,
[2:33:10] the gifts, the gifts, the gifts. And I'm
[2:33:12] all for them. But then the fruits are
[2:33:14] like Baptist, you know, denominational.
[2:33:17] We don't have to love anybody. Oh,
[2:33:18] really? What did Brother Random say his
[2:33:20] problem was with Pentecost? He says,
[2:33:21] "Oh, yeah, they got miracles, but they
[2:33:23] got the temper to fight a buzzsaw."
[2:33:25] Listen,
[2:33:26] brother. If your revelation doesn't make
[2:33:28] you love your brother, you ought to get
[2:33:30] a new revelation.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; If your revelation makes you backbite
[2:33:35] and talk and fuss and talk about every
[2:33:37] other church,
[2:33:39] you ought to get a different revelation.
[2:33:41] If your experience can't make me like
[2:33:43] Jesus, I don't want it.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; But give me the literal life of Jesus
[2:33:49] Christ.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Because when I have him, I have all of
[2:33:53] him.
[2:33:55] And there's miracles, there's signs,
[2:33:57] there's wonders, there's power, there's
[2:33:58] love, there's joy, there's peace.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; And but people always love to emphasize
[2:34:03] one only to deemphasize another.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; It's like brother Brandham always dealt
[2:34:08] with with the two ditches. And and the
[2:34:10] prophet of God said about Calvinism, he
[2:34:12] said, "I'm a Calvinist." You are,
[2:34:13] Brother Brandham? Says, "Oh yeah, I'm a
[2:34:15] Calvinist as long as Calvin's in the
[2:34:17] Bible."
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; But when he gets out of the Bible, I'm
[2:34:20] no longer a Calvinist.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Are you an Armenius? Yeah. as long as
[2:34:24] Armenian is is in the Bible.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Bamson has always tried to
[2:34:27] stand between those two, the
[2:34:28] fundamentalist who had, Brother Bam said
[2:34:30] it this way. He said, "There's always
[2:34:32] two groups of people I find." And he
[2:34:34] says, "One of them has the all the money
[2:34:36] in the bank, but they ain't got enough
[2:34:39] knowledge is what he's saying. They
[2:34:40] don't know who they are.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; They don't know their position
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; cuz they just believe in experience.
[2:34:46] Experience. Experience, but they never
[2:34:47] know the word."
[2:34:49] And brother says, "They got all the
[2:34:51] money in the bank, but they ain't got
[2:34:52] the faith to sign their name on the
[2:34:53] check."
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then I got the other group of
[2:34:55] people who ain't got no money in the
[2:34:57] bank."
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; But they got all the knowledge and the
[2:35:00] precepts of the word of God, the good,
[2:35:02] kind old priest who gives to the poor,
[2:35:04] feeds the hungry, has all of the nature,
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; but he lacks the power.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Baron says, "Oh, but if I could
[2:35:13] ever get the two groups
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; together,
[2:35:18] Oh, brother. I tell you what I believe
[2:35:20] this revival is. It is the two groups
[2:35:23] coming back together.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says, notice
[2:35:28] always, it was always two ditches. He
[2:35:31] says, one ditch over here. You got the,
[2:35:32] you know, brother Adam says, some people
[2:35:34] make church a funeral.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Just real quiet. And that has a place.
[2:35:46] But brother Adam says, "But it's not a
[2:35:48] funeral.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Church shouldn't be a funeral."
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Then you have the other
[2:35:53] side that makes it a frolic."
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And it's not a frolic."
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; Then which is it, Brother Brandham? It's
[2:36:00] a feast.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the bride goes down
[2:36:04] the middle of the road.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; But catch it, drawing from both sides."
[2:36:13] You see why the devil wants to divide us
[2:36:16] and separate us and draw circles?
[2:36:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; I tell you what your prophet said. I
[2:36:22] don't draw a circle. I just draw the
[2:36:25] circle bigger.
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; But we got division over here in this
[2:36:31] group and this church. And I think I I
[2:36:33] think there's a people that say, "I'm
[2:36:35] done with the fighting. I'm done with
[2:36:37] the arguing. I'm done with the fussing.
[2:36:39] I want the power of God.
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; And we we divide over here and separate
[2:36:48] over here and separate over here. And
[2:36:50] brother Brandon says got a ditch over
[2:36:52] here. And some, you know, it's so funny
[2:36:53] because people always do that. You got
[2:36:55] one group that says, "We don't need the
[2:36:56] preachers.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; We just need the tapes.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; Deemphasize or deify. One or the other.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; We don't need preachers. We We just need
[2:37:07] the tapes." Well, then you got another
[2:37:08] group that says, "We don't need to
[2:37:09] listen to Brother Brandham anymore. We
[2:37:11] got the ministry." You know, the You got
[2:37:13] some who say, "We don't need the tapes.
[2:37:15] We just need our Bibles."
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; You got some say, "We don't need Bibles.
[2:37:18] We just need the tapes."
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; You got one group that says, "We just
[2:37:23] need shouting and jumping and dancing."
[2:37:25] I'm all for those things. Brother Adam
[2:37:26] said that he was. But if your life don't
[2:37:28] cope with what you're shouting about,
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; and then you got some say, "We don't
[2:37:34] need any of those things. The gifts are
[2:37:35] on the mantle. We don't need none of
[2:37:37] that." that no more that's all
[2:37:38] Pentecostal and and and we just got the
[2:37:40] word and the word only and then they
[2:37:42] separate themselves over here.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, we don't we don't we don't need
[2:37:46] those kind of things. We don't need to
[2:37:47] love our brother. We we don't need mar
[2:37:50] that's always to don't you see it's the
[2:37:52] tactic of the devil
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; to push us into a ditch.
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; I got news for you, brother. One ditch
[2:37:58] ain't no better than the next ditch.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; And the bride wasn't called to walk in a
[2:38:03] ditch. She was called to walk in the
[2:38:06] middle of the road.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Math, then what is it?
[2:38:11] Do we need preachers? Is it our Bible?
[2:38:13] Do we need tapes? Do we need books?"
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Which is it, Brother Matt?
[2:38:17] You're confusing me. Can I just make it
[2:38:19] simple?" You need all of it.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; You need your Bible. You need the tapes.
[2:38:24] You need the books. You need preachers.
[2:38:27] You need people. You need pastors.
[2:38:30] You need a prophet. And I say, "Give me
[2:38:33] it all, Lord. I want all of it, Jesus.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Don't let me settle for one. Give me it
[2:38:41] all, Lord.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; You need everything
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; that God has given and restored back.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; You need it all.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Need it all." You see, with Christ would
[2:38:57] come the miraculous. Listen friends, if
[2:39:00] we ever believe in the supernatural,
[2:39:04] Lord, if we ever need the supernatural,
[2:39:07] Lord, it's now.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:39:10] &gt;&gt; People say we don't we don't need the
[2:39:12] supernatural. God, anymore. I ask what
[2:39:14] what kind of world are you living in?
[2:39:16] &gt;&gt; If we ever need the gifts of the spirit,
[2:39:18] they're now.
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; If we ever need preachers, it's now.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; But I say more than preachers, we need a
[2:39:25] people who live. Oh, I can hear the
[2:39:28] prophet saying, "What is the thunder
[2:39:30] that shakes the devil?" It's the life of
[2:39:33] lived voice of lived lives. That's the
[2:39:36] thunder that shakes the devil's kingdom.
[2:39:38] He don't care how much you shout. He
[2:39:40] don't care how much you dance. But what
[2:39:42] he can't do anything about, brother, is
[2:39:44] when that Zoey seed life comes into your
[2:39:47] vessel and it begins to live like Jesus,
[2:39:50] think like Jesus, act like Jesus, love
[2:39:53] like Jesus, believe like Jesus. Listen
[2:40:01] what brother Brandon says. I'm just
[2:40:02] going to skip some of this because we
[2:40:03] got to close. Are you with me still?
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Don't get scared. As brother Diggs says,
[2:40:09] I'm fixing to close.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother Brandham says here.
[2:40:15] He says, oh, he's talking about Moses
[2:40:17] and why Christ speak. I'm just going to
[2:40:18] skip some of this down, brother. He says
[2:40:20] in verse in in slide 18, I think any man
[2:40:23] or woman or boy or girl in an
[2:40:25] intellectual conception of what they
[2:40:27] think the word is can never have a full
[2:40:29] foundation stand
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; until they have met that light
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; that brings that word to a reality.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; You can have a picture of the pillar of
[2:40:39] fire and that's wonderful. You can have
[2:40:41] a tie pin of the pillar of fire and the
[2:40:43] the the the cloud on sunset mountain.
[2:40:46] I'm all for that, brother. But that
[2:40:48] cloud has got to live in your life.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; That pillar of fire has got to come off
[2:40:53] the picture.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; It brings the word to a reality.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Adam says, "Just as we know, as
[2:41:02] a man asked me a few moments ago about
[2:41:05] the coming, this is just two slides
[2:41:06] down, slide 20, about the coming of the
[2:41:09] Lord." And he says, "About the coming
[2:41:11] and the rapture." And we know we've
[2:41:15] lived the time out
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; and the time of the rapture
[2:41:20] is at hand.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; You know what that means? Anytime you
[2:41:30] read that in the Bible, it says,
[2:41:31] "Behold, he cometh." And you always say
[2:41:33] you you always read the way that the the
[2:41:35] the that the words would say that, but
[2:41:37] then it would say, "It's at hand."
[2:41:41] And if you ever want to know what that
[2:41:42] means, it means it's within your reach.
[2:41:49] &gt;&gt; The rapture is within our reach.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And we're looking." How
[2:41:58] many's looking?
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; What were you looking for, Brother
[2:42:00] Brandham? a rapturing faith
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; that can pull the church
[2:42:06] &gt;&gt; together
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; and give it some supernatural
[2:42:12] strength
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; that can change these bodies that we
[2:42:18] live in.
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; When we see a God that can raise the
[2:42:21] dead off the floor out in the yard and
[2:42:23] bring him back to life again presenting
[2:42:25] before us. When we see a God who can
[2:42:27] take a cancer that's ate a man to a
[2:42:30] shadow and raise him up to a strong
[2:42:32] healthy man that ought to give rapturing
[2:42:36] faith
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; to the people.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Four years ago now we we're at our in
[2:42:42] our city back home in Buford where we're
[2:42:44] from. I have a very good friend of mine.
[2:42:46] He's one of my closest friends, brother
[2:42:47] Travis Jackson. He's just a just a a
[2:42:50] brother that if you ever had a chance to
[2:42:51] meet him, boy, you wouldn't be running
[2:42:53] for two minutes. I don't care if you're
[2:42:55] his mechanic. I don't care if you're his
[2:42:57] pest control guy. I don't care if you're
[2:42:59] the person working at the cashier.
[2:43:01] You're going to hear about Jesus.
[2:43:04] Travis would just he's got such a bold
[2:43:06] faith. And and years ago, he wasn't born
[2:43:09] in the message, wasn't raised in the
[2:43:10] message, and he's he's he's as a young
[2:43:12] boy, 13 or actually younger than that.
[2:43:15] his mom and dad were uh in a the Buford
[2:43:17] Baptist church and he grew up in the in
[2:43:19] the Baptist church but his dad he became
[2:43:21] disillusioned with a with you know he'd
[2:43:23] go out for the deacons would leave
[2:43:25] church for a smoke break and he just
[2:43:27] couldn't understand that how are these
[2:43:28] people saying they're Christians so his
[2:43:30] dad stops going his mom they backslide
[2:43:32] but little Travis is just a a boy is
[2:43:34] reading his Bible in his room mama
[2:43:36] didn't even know it and he's he's
[2:43:38] reading about the Lord and talking to
[2:43:40] the Lord and praying he wasn't a
[2:43:42] believer not a message believer at all
[2:43:44] and he and He's there one day and he's
[2:43:46] going through his mom's books in her
[2:43:47] closet and he pulls out a book that had
[2:43:49] no spine in it. Brother David, it was
[2:43:51] just all tattered and broken up and he
[2:43:53] begins to read that book. That book was
[2:43:57] Acts of the Prophet written by Perry
[2:43:59] Green.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; To this day, they don't know how the
[2:44:02] book got there in her closet.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; And and Travis begins to read Travis
[2:44:08] begins to read about read this book. He
[2:44:10] had went everywhere. This is service at
[2:44:12] 16 years old. He'd went everywhere,
[2:44:13] Brother Matthew. It went to every
[2:44:14] church. He was a church hopper. Tried
[2:44:16] every church in town. This church to
[2:44:18] that church to this church. He'd always
[2:44:19] get to he said, "I always get to the
[2:44:20] youth leader and say, "Brother, uh, I
[2:44:22] believe that we're, you know, you people
[2:44:24] are wonderful." But he says, "But
[2:44:26] where's the God I read about in the book
[2:44:28] of Acts when Pet when when when Peter
[2:44:30] said, "Silver and gold have I none, but
[2:44:32] such as I have, I give thee in the name
[2:44:35] of Jesus Christ. Rise up and walk."
[2:44:37] Where do we Where's men like Stephen who
[2:44:39] the Bible says was full of the Holy
[2:44:42] Ghost. And he says, "Where's men that
[2:44:44] are full with the Holy Ghost?" And he
[2:44:46] says, "Every single time I would say
[2:44:49] that that it's, oh yeah, Travis, those
[2:44:51] were wonderful things, but you have to
[2:44:52] understand the apostolic age is over,
[2:44:54] and God don't do that anymore."
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; Isn't that exactly what they try to tell
[2:44:59] Brother Brandon?
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; Those those those were just uh, you
[2:45:02] know, the gifts for the early church,
[2:45:03] but those things aren't in in operation
[2:45:05] anymore. We don't we just believe the
[2:45:07] the word only now. This is what they
[2:45:09] tell him that, you know. And Travis
[2:45:11] said, "That didn't sound right. I'd go
[2:45:12] to the next church. He'd go to the youth
[2:45:14] leader, go to the pastor, talk to the
[2:45:15] pastor of the mega church, the biggest
[2:45:16] church in our city, Evangelical
[2:45:18] Evangelical Reformed Baptist Church. And
[2:45:20] he talked to the pastor, Dallas
[2:45:22] Theological Seminary right here in
[2:45:23] Dallas. He's a very educated man. And
[2:45:25] that's what he told him. He said, I
[2:45:26] talked to him. He said, "I believe
[2:45:28] you're wonderful. I love your teaching.
[2:45:29] You teach on the word, but where is the
[2:45:31] God we read about in the Bible? Why
[2:45:34] don't we see the manifestation of the
[2:45:36] spirit like we read about in the Bible?"
[2:45:38] And he said, he looked at me with all of
[2:45:39] his education and said, "Well, Travis,
[2:45:41] you have to understand that God did
[2:45:43] those things only for the early church
[2:45:45] to establish the church. But the the
[2:45:47] last miracle ended with the death of the
[2:45:49] last apostle."
[2:45:52] &gt;&gt; Really, go read Irenus.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; You'll you'll see a man who believed in
[2:45:56] tongues. He believed in prophecy. He
[2:45:58] believed in interpretation.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; You'll go read even the church age
[2:46:01] messenger Cola. And the BBC did an
[2:46:04] article on the life of Columba. And you
[2:46:06] can go find this. I'll give you the
[2:46:07] article if you want it and said this was
[2:46:08] the BBC secular talking about a church
[2:46:11] age messenger we know as Columbus and
[2:46:13] said he was a man who believed in the
[2:46:15] supernatural and miracles took place. He
[2:46:17] even his horse died and he brought his
[2:46:19] horse back to life. That's right out of
[2:46:21] the BBC. And it said also there was a
[2:46:24] strange column of fire that accompanied
[2:46:27] his ministry seen several times.
[2:46:31] That's why the prophet of God could say
[2:46:32] the same light of the candle went to all
[2:46:35] of those seven church age messengers.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; That fire wasn't just for listen friend.
[2:46:39] The pillar of fire didn't come in our
[2:46:41] didn't just come in our generation. It
[2:46:42] was a return of a pillar of fire that
[2:46:45] met Paul on the road to Damascus and
[2:46:47] said, "Who are you Lord? I I am Jesus
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; who you persecute."
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; And that same pillar of fire that was
[2:46:55] with Cola appeared in our generation.
[2:46:58] And he said that they they ended with
[2:46:59] the death of the last apostle. Travis
[2:47:01] said that didn't sound right. So he
[2:47:02] finds this book, Acts of the Apo, Acts
[2:47:05] of the the prophet. And he says, "Oh,
[2:47:07] now here's a man. Here's what I've been
[2:47:10] looking for."
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; And he goes to his mom, "Mom, where did
[2:47:13] you get this?" He says, "Honey, I don't
[2:47:15] know where in the world that books. You
[2:47:17] got to read it." He gives it to her to
[2:47:19] read. She goes to She's a plumbing a
[2:47:20] secretary at a at a at a plumbing
[2:47:23] business. She's a secretary there. And a
[2:47:24] man from our church actually walks in
[2:47:26] and sees this woman, this sinner woman
[2:47:28] reading the Acts of the Prophet.
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Where did you get that
[2:47:33] book?" She says, "Oh, my son got it."
[2:47:35] And boy, he sure loves it. He wants me
[2:47:37] to read it. He said, "If I if he like
[2:47:39] that, I got something for him." So he
[2:47:40] goes back and gets brother Owen's
[2:47:42] supernatural series and he brings him a
[2:47:44] supernatural book and it gives it to
[2:47:47] Travis. And Travis said, "I started
[2:47:48] reading that book and I didn't know he
[2:47:50] it was unconclusive because of the book
[2:47:51] he had. He didn't know brother Brandham
[2:47:53] died." And so you he said, "You know
[2:47:55] what I did, brother Matt?" He said, "I
[2:47:56] started asking every single person I
[2:47:59] would talk to, have you ever heard of
[2:48:00] William Brandham?
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of William Brandom?"
[2:48:04] No. No. Never heard of him. He says,
[2:48:06] "Man, person, every work associate,
[2:48:08] everybody had talked to." One day, just
[2:48:10] so happens, he's riding in the van as
[2:48:13] he's an HBAC tech and he's in the van
[2:48:16] with a backsliden message believer
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; who hadn't been to church in years.
[2:48:23] didn't even we didn't even know if he
[2:48:24] was still in town. Didn't know anything
[2:48:26] about him. He just left. His marriage
[2:48:27] went arry and he left, you know, left
[2:48:29] our church and just so happens God
[2:48:32] doesn't do nothing by accident.
[2:48:34] Just so happens he's in there and he
[2:48:36] says, "Hey, Dave." Yeah. They're
[2:48:38] driving. Have you ever heard of William
[2:48:40] Brandon?
[2:48:45] Dave's bald. He said, but he said,
[2:48:47] "Every little hair I had was standing
[2:48:49] straight up." He said, "I just held this
[2:48:51] term." He said,
[2:48:53] Yeah. He said, "You have? You're the
[2:48:56] first person to hear it, to say you
[2:48:58] really?" He says, "Yeah." He says,
[2:48:59] "There's a whole church that that
[2:49:01] believes that he was the, you know, a
[2:49:03] prophet." He says, "Yeah, of course he
[2:49:04] was a prophet." And he says that, you
[2:49:06] know, they believe he was the church age
[2:49:08] messenger. He said, "Church? Church
[2:49:09] age?" You know, I I don't know. He said,
[2:49:10] he said, "There's a church here." I get
[2:49:12] a call that that day from Dave. I heard
[2:49:15] from for years. He says, "Matt," I said,
[2:49:16] Dave, he said, "You got to help me."
[2:49:22] I said, "What? What's going on, Dave?"
[2:49:24] He said, "I'm riding in the van with
[2:49:26] this sinner just working with me." And
[2:49:28] he asked me if I had ever heard of
[2:49:30] William Brandham.
[2:49:32] He said, "I I" He said, "I I I was I'm
[2:49:34] in no condition to talk to him at all."
[2:49:36] I said, "I need you to come over to my
[2:49:37] house. Can you come? I've invited him
[2:49:39] tonight. Can you come?" I had a friend
[2:49:40] of Irish, Brother Rick Perie, and also
[2:49:42] my brother Jonathan uh there. Rick was
[2:49:44] visiting from out of town. And so I I
[2:49:47] get this call said, "Hey, I don't know
[2:49:48] what we're going to run into, but this
[2:49:49] guy, we want to he wants to you meet
[2:49:51] us." And and and so we go there and I'll
[2:49:53] never forget we knock on the door. First
[2:49:55] time I ever laid my eyes on him. Now, if
[2:49:56] Travis was here, I'm just going to tell
[2:49:58] you what he says in his testimony. He
[2:50:00] says that when those three men walked in
[2:50:03] the door, we knocked on the door. He
[2:50:05] says, "When you walked through the
[2:50:07] door," he said, a voice spoke, audible
[2:50:09] voice, and said, "Behold, men of the
[2:50:12] Lord, men full of the Holy Ghost.
[2:50:16] Travis says, "I knew at that moment what
[2:50:18] I had been looking for since I was a boy
[2:50:21] had just walked in the door."
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; We got to fellowshipping with him. We
[2:50:32] got to fellowshipping with him. And we
[2:50:34] said, "Travis," he's talking to us, just
[2:50:36] pouring his heart out. And we go to a
[2:50:38] coffee shop and and he says,"We says,
[2:50:40] "Travis, you got to come to our church."
[2:50:41] He says, "Where's your church?" We said,
[2:50:43] "2608 Mossios Road." He said, "Mossio,
[2:50:46] Mossio's road." He said, "Do you
[2:50:48] realize?" And he names the street he his
[2:50:51] house he grew up in that he lived in his
[2:50:53] whole life was only, as the crow flies,
[2:50:55] about two or 30 hundred yards.
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "You mean what I've been
[2:50:59] looking for? My whole life has been
[2:51:02] right. That little church I passed every
[2:51:05] Oh, my brother, my sister, what you're
[2:51:07] looking for is not way down the road
[2:51:10] somewhere. It's in the building right
[2:51:12] now.
[2:51:15] The God you're looking for is here.
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; Stop looking down the road. He's right
[2:51:20] in the building.
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:51:29] Don't tell me God ain't a God of the
[2:51:30] supernatural. Don't tell me ain't God
[2:51:33] ain't a God of the miracles. I already
[2:51:34] seen him operate too many times,
[2:51:36] brother. He is the same yesterday,
[2:51:39] today, and forever. He'll be the same.
[2:51:45] He he he's that's been years ago now he
[2:51:48] married brother Dell Smith's daughter
[2:51:50] actually and they got a beautiful family
[2:51:52] and and years go down the road years
[2:51:54] later 10 I don't know how many years 10
[2:51:56] or 13 12 years and Travis comes to me
[2:51:59] I'm with him at a at a event and there's
[2:52:01] a man there I meet and he says I want
[2:52:03] you to meet this man he says this was my
[2:52:05] former pastor the last church I went to
[2:52:07] before I found your church before I
[2:52:08] found the message and he said I want you
[2:52:10] to meet him as a wonderful Christian man
[2:52:11] I always wanted to leading to the
[2:52:13] message. And I said, "I'll go meet this
[2:52:15] man." And I introduce myself and he's
[2:52:17] there and that was it. And then about
[2:52:19] two or three months, maybe four months
[2:52:20] later, uh Travis calls me says, "And
[2:52:23] it's a Saturday and I'm preparing my you
[2:52:26] were out of town and it was I was going
[2:52:27] to preach that Sunday morning and I'd
[2:52:29] been studying all day to get ready for
[2:52:32] the service and Travis called me. He
[2:52:33] said, "Matt, I hate to bother you." He
[2:52:35] says, "Can you do me a favor?" He says,
[2:52:36] "You remember Marcus Humphrey?" I said,
[2:52:38] "Yeah, that man I met there." He said,
[2:52:40] "Yeah." He said, "I got terrible news.
[2:52:42] Mary called me today. He's been
[2:52:44] diagnosed with cancer, stage four
[2:52:46] non-hodkins lymphoma. They've just given
[2:52:49] him just a few months to live." I said,
[2:52:50] "What? That man I just met?" He said,
[2:52:52] "Yeah." He said, "He's full of cancer."
[2:52:54] He said, "Will you go with me and lay
[2:52:56] hands on him? I want to anoint him with
[2:52:57] oil and and and pray for him." Just so
[2:53:01] happened
[2:53:03] all day I'd been studying one book,
[2:53:05] Healing,
[2:53:07] &gt;&gt; what cancer is.
[2:53:11] So, you know what I did? I just did
[2:53:12] everything Brother Brandham said to that
[2:53:14] man.
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; I'd been studying it all day. What is
[2:53:19] cancer?
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; We walk, we go there to that little
[2:53:22] apartment. We knock on the door and
[2:53:23] there's that man and he's there and
[2:53:25] looks so different. My goodness, he was
[2:53:27] just just looks so different. And he's
[2:53:30] there and you could just feel the room,
[2:53:31] the atmosphere of the room was just so
[2:53:33] low and he and and his trustees there
[2:53:36] and they're just there to be with him
[2:53:37] and comfort him. and I didn't really
[2:53:39] know what to do. And you know, Travis is
[2:53:41] there and we're sort of it's awkward and
[2:53:43] you could just feel the sorrow in the
[2:53:45] room and and and and and you know and
[2:53:48] I'm just waiting on the Lord saying,
[2:53:49] "Lord, what are you going to do? I don't
[2:53:50] even know how to approach this." And
[2:53:52] Travis just starts in he said, "Marcus,
[2:53:54] you know, tell me what's going on." He
[2:53:55] said, "Well, they've given me tried
[2:53:56] chemo eight times and failed all eight
[2:53:58] times. They told me to go home. I won't
[2:54:00] live. I just have a little bit of time
[2:54:02] to live. This ain't how I wanted to go.
[2:54:04] I didn't want to die this way." But but
[2:54:06] he says, "But you know, uh, every man's
[2:54:08] got to die." And Travis says, "Well," he
[2:54:10] says, "Well, Marcus," he says. He says,
[2:54:13] "I guess with as serious as it as it
[2:54:15] is," he said, "I'm just going to cut
[2:54:18] right to the chase." He said, "I'm just
[2:54:20] going to be real straight and honest
[2:54:22] with you." He says, "Sure, Travis." And
[2:54:24] he says, "I I just want to tell you,
[2:54:25] Marcus," he says, "I love you, and I
[2:54:27] believe you and Mary are wonderful
[2:54:29] Christian people." He says, "But when I
[2:54:31] was at your church, I was searching for
[2:54:33] the living God." And he says, "And I
[2:54:35] want to tell you, I found a living God."
[2:54:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "He's a God of miracles
[2:54:39] still. He's a He's the God, same God of
[2:54:41] the God of the apostles that you read
[2:54:43] about in the book of Acts. He's still
[2:54:44] alive today." And he says, "And God is
[2:54:46] not in your church. He's not in your
[2:54:48] denomination. The trinity is a doctrine
[2:54:50] of the devils." And he says, "It's not
[2:54:52] father, son, and holy ghost." And he
[2:54:54] said he's it's a denominational system
[2:54:56] is going to take the mark of the beast.
[2:54:57] And he says, "And I want I'm just
[2:54:59] thinking, whoa,
[2:55:02] whoa, double barrel shotgun."
[2:55:07] I told him after I got out, I said,
[2:55:08] "Buddy, if I'm ever fighting for my life
[2:55:10] in a foxhole, I want you in my pack."
[2:55:14] I mean, he just, you know, he's not in
[2:55:16] this and he's not God and he's not the
[2:55:18] God of your denomination. And and this
[2:55:20] is my friend Matt. Go ahead, Matt.
[2:55:27] Well,
[2:55:30] I said I said, "Well, you know," and
[2:55:32] Travis stopped. He said, "Marcus," he
[2:55:34] said, "I He" He said, "I sure hope you
[2:55:36] know my heart."
[2:55:38] He said, "I I didn't say any of that to
[2:55:40] hurt you." He said, "I love you. I think
[2:55:42] you're a Christian man." He said, "I'm
[2:55:44] not trying to hurt you." He said, "I
[2:55:46] hope I didn't offend you." And I'll
[2:55:48] never forget Marcus just sat there and
[2:55:50] he said, "No, Travis." He said, "You
[2:55:52] didn't you didn't bother me at all." He
[2:55:55] said, "In fact, when you and your friend
[2:55:56] here knocked on the door, a voice spoke
[2:55:59] to me and said, "These are men sent from
[2:56:01] the Lord. Listen to what they have to
[2:56:04] say."
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "So I was prepared for anything
[2:56:08] you tell you what friends, God works on
[2:56:11] both ends.
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; Take no thought for what you'll say, for
[2:56:14] in that moment, the words will be given
[2:56:16] to you."
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; And and I just began to break in. I
[2:56:19] said, "Marcus," I said, "I I listen."
[2:56:21] And I said, "I I I don't have any, you
[2:56:23] know, I I don't have any tools. I don't
[2:56:24] have a doctor's bag, you know, to to to
[2:56:26] work on you or to look at you." I said,
[2:56:28] "But I do got a book full of promises."
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; And I said, "And I just want to tell you
[2:56:34] about some of those promises." I started
[2:56:36] telling him, I said, "In fact, there's a
[2:56:38] little sister that I know." And I said,
[2:56:40] "She's she's from Louisiana." And I
[2:56:42] said, "She was actually diagnosed, you
[2:56:44] could go to the next slide, with the
[2:56:45] same exact disease that they've
[2:56:48] diagnosed you with.
[2:56:51] And I said, "But this little sister
[2:56:52] Elena and doctors had done PET scans on
[2:56:55] her and told her she she, you know, that
[2:56:57] she had cancer, you know, and these kind
[2:56:59] of things." And I said, "And Mary's, you
[2:57:01] could just feel it right at that
[2:57:02] moment." Uh, you know, her heart just
[2:57:05] Mary's heart just began to lift. I just
[2:57:07] want to pull this up if I can. Uh, uh,
[2:57:10] this is this is just from her own
[2:57:12] testimony. She says, "A week before
[2:57:14] Christmas, I was diagnosed with stage 4
[2:57:16] Hodkins lymphoma. Two days after
[2:57:19] Christmas, I started the first of 12
[2:57:21] chemo treatments. They told me that
[2:57:23] after four treatments, they would do a
[2:57:24] PET scan and to see how my my body is
[2:57:27] responding. I believe God is a healer.
[2:57:28] This is Sister Elena Buts. She says, "I
[2:57:30] believe God is a healer." And I've told
[2:57:32] that to anyone who asks how I'm doing. I
[2:57:34] told them that I was looking to him and
[2:57:36] believe that he would heal me. On
[2:57:38] Sunday, I leaped and danced. Go to the
[2:57:40] next slide. I leaped and danced before
[2:57:42] the Lord. To the next one, I leaped and
[2:57:45] danced before the Lord. Notice what my
[2:57:47] what our sister did here. Sometimes it
[2:57:49] takes something natural to move the
[2:57:52] supernatural.
[2:57:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; You see, sometimes God is looking for
[2:57:56] you to do something.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Draw nigh unto me and
[2:58:02] I'll draw nigh unto you."
[2:58:05] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we're waiting on God and
[2:58:07] God's waiting on us.
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; She began, you know, to to to leap and
[2:58:11] dance before the Lord. Listen to this.
[2:58:13] She says, "I I began to leap and dance
[2:58:15] before the Lord and and with joy and
[2:58:18] victory because I knew it was already a
[2:58:20] finished work, even though I didn't know
[2:58:22] how or when. Even though there was no
[2:58:25] proof yet," they were singing, "What
[2:58:28] have I to dread? What have I to fear?
[2:58:32] Leaning on the everlasting arms. I have
[2:58:34] blessedness with my Lord so near.
[2:58:36] Leaning on the everlasting arms." That
[2:58:38] sounds strange to many, but in the
[2:58:40] Bible, Miam danced for joy when she
[2:58:43] crossed the Red Sea and the Egyptians
[2:58:45] who had enslaved them were drowned.
[2:58:47] David danced for joy when he saw the ark
[2:58:50] of the covenant brought back to
[2:58:51] Jerusalem. It's an expression of extreme
[2:58:53] joy and victory. I knew my healing would
[2:58:56] come sooner or later because the Jesus
[2:58:59] of the Bible, the great healer, is the
[2:59:02] same Jesus I have served for 27 years.
[2:59:07] She says, "Yesterday I had my PET scan
[2:59:12] and today I met with the doctor before
[2:59:14] my fif fifth treatment. He informed me
[2:59:16] the cancer is already gone. That's my
[2:59:20] God. That's Jesus.
[2:59:24] That's the God of this Bible.
[2:59:27] That's the God of the supernatural."
[2:59:30] Hallelujah.
[2:59:33] Oh, if you don't praise him, the rocks
[2:59:35] shall cry out and praise him. If we
[2:59:38] don't lift him up,
[2:59:43] you ought to have seen that that woman's
[2:59:45] eyes. She begins to weep and cry, but
[2:59:47] she she began to weep and cry. Oh, I I I
[2:59:51] sat there and I said that. I said,
[2:59:53] "Yeah." I said, "The same same exact
[2:59:55] disease." She says, "I've always
[2:59:57] believed in a God of the supernatural."
[2:59:59] She says, "When I was a little girl, I
[3:00:00] seen my daddy was a missionary and I
[3:00:02] seen someone blind eyes come up." She
[3:00:04] said, "I always knew God was a God of
[3:00:06] the supernatural." And that that
[3:00:07] trusty's wife, she said, "Are you now?
[3:00:09] Hold on, preacher. Are you trying to say
[3:00:11] that God's definitely got to heal him?"
[3:00:13] I said, "No, I'm not saying that. I'm
[3:00:15] just letting you know God can.
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God can.
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; God can do whatever he wants to do.
[3:00:24] &gt;&gt; We didn't ask we God didn't ask us to
[3:00:26] figure it out. He just asked us to
[3:00:28] believe.
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; If you can get the people to believe
[3:00:32] you,
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; nothing will stand in your way, not even
[3:00:36] cancer. Don't you realize how important
[3:00:39] it is for you to believe the word that
[3:00:41] is preached to you and and back it up
[3:00:44] with an amen and say, "Yes, Lord. I
[3:00:46] believe in God. That's for me, Lord."
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; She said, she said, "I always knew
[3:00:55] that." I said, "Now," I said, "I'm just
[3:00:57] going to pray pray for you." And he was
[3:00:59] sitting there. You you could have seen
[3:01:01] the look there. If you can go to the
[3:01:03] next two slides down, you'll see the
[3:01:05] picture of Marcus. The first picture,
[3:01:07] he's there with a cancer, a tumor the
[3:01:10] size of a grapefruit on the side of his
[3:01:12] neck. Go to the next one. You could see
[3:01:14] there was there that one there, the PET
[3:01:17] scan. If you go to the next one there,
[3:01:19] you notice the PET scan that he had that
[3:01:21] cancer. Normally in as you've seen in
[3:01:23] Sister Elena's in a PET scan, you can
[3:01:24] see a dark spot for the heart and dark
[3:01:27] spot for the organs. You can't even see
[3:01:28] it in this picture. Cancer had came all
[3:01:31] the way through his abdomen. He had the
[3:01:33] I looked down on his calf. He had tumors
[3:01:34] the size of apples.
[3:01:37] You know, it's very easy to believe for
[3:01:39] someone else.
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes your condition is so bad
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; that it's hard to believe for yourself.
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; I said sometimes it's hard. This man
[3:01:49] could not believe for himself because
[3:01:51] it's conditional. I'm reminded of of a
[3:01:53] man in the Bible also who couldn't get
[3:01:55] to Jesus. He was lame in a bed, brother
[3:01:57] Matthew. And he couldn't get to Jesus
[3:01:59] was in a home and he couldn't get to
[3:02:00] him. But my Bible says his friends, the
[3:02:03] faith of friends, came over and picked
[3:02:06] up his bed and began to march him to
[3:02:09] Jesus.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says when they got to
[3:02:12] Jesus, they couldn't get in. Too many
[3:02:14] people. That didn't stop them, brother
[3:02:16] Andrew. They climbed up on the roof and
[3:02:20] they tore the roof off. Oh, you ought to
[3:02:23] take that knee right now and say, "God,
[3:02:25] I am climbing up on the roof. I am
[3:02:28] tearing the roof off and I am lowering
[3:02:31] them down to Jesus."
[3:02:34] [Applause]
[3:02:42] &gt;&gt; And I said, "I'm going to pray for you."
[3:02:44] And I believe the God of the Bible can
[3:02:46] heal you. I'd never forget I I was there
[3:02:49] and began to pray. Never forget my
[3:02:51] prayer as I laid my hands upon him.
[3:02:55] And I said, "Lord, even your servant
[3:02:57] Hezekiah came to my mind who was told he
[3:02:59] was going to die. But he so pleaded with
[3:03:03] the Lord for his own life. And you added
[3:03:05] years to his life. Now God, remember
[3:03:08] this man. He stood for you. He's
[3:03:10] preached Jesus. He believes in your
[3:03:12] word. God, will you honor him, Lord?
[3:03:16] And I we you know what we did? You say,
[3:03:18] "Brother Matt, what happened? What
[3:03:19] happened? The the earth shake? Did the
[3:03:21] Did the windows ratt or the door shake?"
[3:03:23] No, nothing happened. You know what we
[3:03:24] did? We did what the Bible says. We
[3:03:27] brought our burdens to the Lord and we
[3:03:28] left them there.
[3:03:32] &gt;&gt; Left there. Travis says, "What do you
[3:03:34] think?" I said, "What? It's up to God
[3:03:36] now. We did all we could do.
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; That's all we have to do. Don't try to
[3:03:40] manufacture it. Work it up. It's in
[3:03:42] God's lap. Now,
[3:03:45] &gt;&gt; that's where we get into trouble. We try
[3:03:47] to manual. Brother Brandon says, "You
[3:03:48] just believe it.
[3:03:50] &gt;&gt; Just confess it." That's what ABCs are.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; Always believe Christ.
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; What you What do you got to do? You got
[3:03:57] to confess it. You got to believe it.
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; Accepting, believing, confessing.
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; And and and and and I said, "I just
[3:04:05] leave it there." We left the burden
[3:04:06] there. Left it. Didn't hear anything for
[3:04:08] for weeks, months, even went by. I
[3:04:10] forget how many months now, three or
[3:04:12] four months. Just so happens Travis is
[3:04:15] in my living room and we're just talking
[3:04:17] about a boat and all kinds of things.
[3:04:19] Nothing to do with anything. He's
[3:04:20] talking about fishing and he's talking
[3:04:22] to me mid-sentence and he pulls out his
[3:04:24] phone as he gets a text and his eyes got
[3:04:26] about that big. And he said, "Matt, Mary
[3:04:28] just texted me. Marcus has been
[3:04:31] supernaturally healed of stage 4
[3:04:34] nonhotkins lymphoma.
[3:04:37] The living God has so healed his body.
[3:04:43] Go to the next one. He has healed of
[3:04:46] cancer. That's my God. That's the God of
[3:04:50] the supernatural.
[3:04:52] What is your need tonight?
[3:04:55] Oh, what is your need tonight in this
[3:04:57] building? That's my Jesus.
[3:05:04] I tell you what, the Lord, that sister
[3:05:07] began to sing that song. I believe I was
[3:05:09] there in the back when God put this
[3:05:11] changed my entire direction and God
[3:05:13] reminded of me of something he told me
[3:05:14] when he gave me the inspiration for this
[3:05:16] sermon. God gave it to me so clear and I
[3:05:19] want to give it to you now. Don't give
[3:05:21] up on your miracle.
[3:05:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rewrite it. Don't
[3:05:26] let the devil explain it away. Don't
[3:05:29] give up on your promise. If you ever
[3:05:32] believed, believe now.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; If you ever testified, testify now.
[3:05:38] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I believe it, Lord." Oh,
[3:05:40] stand to your feet with me. Say, "God, I
[3:05:43] believe it with all of my heart, Jesus.
[3:05:46] Nothing
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; is impossible.
[3:05:50] &gt;&gt; Nothing
[3:05:52] is impossible." Musicians, come bow your
[3:05:55] heads with me. Every head bowed, every
[3:05:57] eye closed. You've got to seek God.
[3:06:01] is not the God of going backwards.
[3:06:03] Elisha,
[3:06:06] he's the God of the double portion. He
[3:06:09] wants to give you more. You say more,
[3:06:11] brother Matt. Elisha needed not just
[3:06:13] what Elijah had. He needed double. He
[3:06:16] needed double the zeal, double the
[3:06:18] sincerity, double the belief, double the
[3:06:21] faith. Say, "Oh, oh, where where's the
[3:06:23] where's God at now, brother? He's right
[3:06:25] here.
[3:06:27] He's the God of the miraculous. He's the
[3:06:30] God of the supernatural.
[3:06:32] &gt;&gt; He's the God of the impossible.
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; When it looks impossible, what is
[3:06:40] impossible with man is possible
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; with God.
[3:06:45] Oh, I feel him right now moving. Every
[3:06:48] head bowed, every eye closed as they
[3:06:50] just play something very softly to the
[3:06:52] Lord.
[3:06:56] Don't give up on your miracle.
[3:07:00] You might not even intended to be here
[3:07:03] tonight, but here you are. You you you
[3:07:06] might you might have didn't expect this
[3:07:08] at all. Neither did I. But here we are.
[3:07:12] What could God do? You say, "Brother
[3:07:13] Matt, what what can God do?" God listen,
[3:07:16] friends, the healing of your body is
[3:07:17] wonderful.
[3:07:19] The the healing of the body is
[3:07:20] wonderful, but you may he may heal you
[3:07:22] of the body and you you get sick again,
[3:07:24] but what about your soul here tonight?
[3:07:27] What about that inside eternal part of
[3:07:29] you? You need healing tonight. You need
[3:07:33] a God of the supernatural to move in
[3:07:35] your life in such a way you say, "Lord,
[3:07:37] I'm raising my hand up in a sign of
[3:07:39] surrender. I'm saying, Lord Jesus, I
[3:07:41] want you to come with healing in your
[3:07:42] wings." If it's my spirit, if it's a
[3:07:45] complex, bitterness, a grudge, malice,
[3:07:47] envy, hatred, division, stress,
[3:07:51] depression, anxiety, cancer.
[3:07:55] Doesn't matter what it is, who it's for.
[3:07:58] He's the great physician.
[3:08:01] He's the great physician.
[3:08:03] I wonder if you could just believe him.
[3:08:05] Now, as brother Brandham's told, if you
[3:08:08] can get the people to believe you,
[3:08:10] nothing will stand in your way. Is
[3:08:14] anything too hard for the Lord, Abraham?
[3:08:20] Is anything
[3:08:23] really could there be a need
[3:08:25] that you think's too great? No.
[3:08:30] Yes, Lord.
[3:08:33] Yes, Jesus.
[3:08:35] Oh Lord, we just wait on you now.
[3:08:39] We've preached,
[3:08:40] we've shouted,
[3:08:42] clapped our hands,
[3:08:45] we've sang, Lord, we've gathered in this
[3:08:47] building. We've prepared a a place and a
[3:08:49] time. We've set it aside.
[3:08:51] Oh Lord Jesus, for what we spoke on last
[3:08:54] night for that encounter, for that
[3:08:56] moment, for that moment with you, Lord,
[3:09:00] I believe that angels are here. They've
[3:09:03] been here from the beginning of this
[3:09:04] service and they came with a mission.
[3:09:08] Some came to heal. Some came to
[3:09:10] encourage. Some came to energize. Some
[3:09:13] came with answers to questions. Some
[3:09:15] came to to to give faith. And I just
[3:09:18] raise hands and say, "Hey, Lord, if
[3:09:20] you've sent something my way, don't let
[3:09:22] me miss it. Lord, let me receive it
[3:09:24] right now by faith. Lord God, I lift up
[3:09:27] my hands in this building and I say,
[3:09:29] Lord Jesus, yes. I want to give you
[3:09:31] free. I want to give you complete
[3:09:33] control. Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Yes, I
[3:09:37] believe. I believe it. I accept it. But
[3:09:40] now, I'm going to confess it
[3:09:42] &gt;&gt; with all of my heart. I'm going to
[3:09:43] confess it. I'm going to believe.
[3:09:47] Oh, my brother, my sister, if you have a
[3:09:48] need, God is here in this building right
[3:09:50] now. The Holy Spirit's brooding. He's
[3:09:53] moving. I could feel him right now.
[3:09:56] And sometimes as I preached on you got
[3:09:58] to do something natural for God to move
[3:10:00] in the supernatural. Wonder if there'd
[3:10:02] be a need here tonight. You want prayer.
[3:10:04] You're welcome to come. If there'd be
[3:10:06] some some situation in your family, in
[3:10:09] your home, and you say, "Lord, I've been
[3:10:11] praying. I've been waiting. But tonight,
[3:10:13] I'm going to walk out of this building
[3:10:15] with my need met. I have determined in
[3:10:18] my heart. I have I've made a decision in
[3:10:21] my heart, Lord. I'm gonna touch the hymn
[3:10:24] of his garment. I'm gonna reach out like
[3:10:26] that little woman. I'm gonna reach with
[3:10:28] my need. From my need, I'm gonna reach
[3:10:31] out. And your prophet said she drew out
[3:10:33] from God what she needed from the Lord.
[3:10:36] So we we do that tonight, Lord. We reach
[3:10:39] out with our hands. We reach out with
[3:10:42] our hearts, Lord. Father, we come with
[3:10:44] an expectation that you are the God of
[3:10:47] the supernatural. that you're still the
[3:10:50] same today, yesterday, today, and
[3:10:52] forever. As you told, as Peter said that
[3:10:56] day on the inaugurational service, the
[3:10:58] promise is unto you. It's unto your
[3:11:01] children. It's unto them that are a far
[3:11:03] off. It as many as the Lord our God
[3:11:07] shall call. The promise, the brother
[3:11:09] Brandham said, of which the apostles
[3:11:11] were endued with is unto you. It's unto
[3:11:14] your children. It's unto your family.
[3:11:16] Oh, you got children need salvation. and
[3:11:18] say, "Lord, the promise is unto me. It's
[3:11:21] unto my children. It's unto my home. I
[3:11:23] don't have to live under the grips of
[3:11:25] the devil. I don't have to live under
[3:11:27] the grips of doubt and fear. I can have
[3:11:29] a blessing spoke over my life. I don't
[3:11:32] have to live under the curse of Satan. I
[3:11:34] don't have to live under the voice of
[3:11:36] Satan. I can be free of it tonight.
[3:11:39] Whatever it is, whatever it is, Lord,
[3:11:41] you are the healer,
[3:11:43] as the song says, of the broken pieces.
[3:11:46] God, you can touch our heart. You can
[3:11:48] make us new. We believe Lord.
[3:11:51] We believe Jesus what he plans us.
[3:11:56] Spirit of God move.

[3:12:02] your prayer?

[3:12:39] it in my heart. Jesus,

[3:15:13] and I've understood the call.

[3:15:24] Lord, I just want to please you. That's
[3:15:29] all I want to do. So, for my soul now, I
[3:15:35] cry out to you,
[3:15:39] Spirit of God.
[3:15:42] But your word in my heart, oh feel my
[3:15:47] hope be.
[3:15:50] Consume my life.

[3:35:10] You know it's here and you know it's in
[3:35:14] the building. And then something inside
[3:35:17] of you, you start to recognize that
[3:35:20] there's something
[3:35:23] out there.
[3:35:26] You know, the prophet of God came,
[3:35:31] he brought the reality of Jesus Christ
[3:35:36] &gt;&gt; into the church.
[3:35:39] And he would say, "He's here.
[3:35:44] Not creeds, not dogmas,
[3:35:48] &gt;&gt; not man's ideas,
[3:35:51] &gt;&gt; but the word that spoke in the beginning
[3:35:53] was here." Amen.
[3:35:58] &gt;&gt; And that reality
[3:36:02] of all that God could do,
[3:36:05] &gt;&gt; all that he wanted to be in your life,
[3:36:08] he made that real.
[3:36:11] &gt;&gt; But when he summed it up, he said,
[3:36:13] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[3:36:20] If any man hear my voice and open the
[3:36:23] door,
[3:36:27] I will come in to him.
[3:36:32] Listen closely.
[3:36:35] The one that was on the outside.
[3:36:39] If you'll open the door and invite him
[3:36:42] in, he'll come from the outside
[3:36:46] in. Amen.
[3:36:49] &gt;&gt; I will come into him and will s with him
[3:36:53] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[3:36:57] I will grant to sit with me in my throne
[3:37:00] even as also
[3:37:03] I overcame
[3:37:05] and sat down with my father in his
[3:37:08] throne. He that hath an ear to hear, let
[3:37:12] him hear what the spirit saith unto the
[3:37:16] churches. That was our age.
[3:37:20] Jesus was on the outside.
[3:37:23] The church recognized him that it was
[3:37:26] him.
[3:37:28] &gt;&gt; They felt the presence.
[3:37:31] They heard the testimonies. That's
[3:37:33] right.
[3:37:34] &gt;&gt; And they knew that was the kind of God
[3:37:36] they believed in.
[3:37:38] We believe in a God that can heal
[3:37:40] cancer.
[3:37:42] &gt;&gt; We believe in a God that can deliver.
[3:37:47] &gt;&gt; And now all he does is he stands at the
[3:37:50] door of your life.
[3:37:53] And you know you believe in him.
[3:37:57] Now all he wants you to do is say,
[3:37:58] "Would you let me come in?" That's
[3:38:00] right.
[3:38:03] &gt;&gt; All that our brother testified about
[3:38:07] the miracles that were in other people's
[3:38:09] lives,
[3:38:11] the testimonies that our messenger
[3:38:14] spoke about, the God that he made so
[3:38:18] real,
[3:38:19] he wanted you to know that that God
[3:38:23] that's on the outside
[3:38:26] wants to come in.
[3:38:29] Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[3:38:39] If any man hear my voice
[3:38:45] and open the door,
[3:38:48] I will come in to him.
[3:38:57] That's our age.
[3:39:00] &gt;&gt; That's our gospel.
[3:39:03] &gt;&gt; The inddwelling spirit of the Lord Jesus
[3:39:07] in our lives. That's the decision that
[3:39:11] we have to make.
[3:39:14] I don't want to believe a God on the
[3:39:17] outside.
[3:39:19] &gt;&gt; I want to believe a God that I know is
[3:39:21] real can live in me.
[3:39:26] And he said, "If I come in with you and
[3:39:28] suck with you, the works that I do
[3:39:32] shall you do also."
[3:39:34] &gt;&gt; Is that for preachers? No.
[3:39:37] &gt;&gt; That's for every
[3:39:40] &gt;&gt; believer.
[3:39:42] [Music]
[3:39:45] That same God
[3:39:48] can dwell in you. And our messenger was
[3:39:52] trying to get that message out to the
[3:39:55] people.
[3:39:58] He would say it over and over again. The
[3:40:01] church put them on the outside.
[3:40:04] Don't leave them on the outside of your
[3:40:06] life.
[3:40:08] Don't look back at where you've been.
[3:40:12] Make a decision in your heart where you
[3:40:14] want to go. That's right.
[3:40:17] &gt;&gt; Do you want him living in you?
[3:40:22] And if you invite him in,
[3:40:25] he will change your life forever.
[3:40:29] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to make this invitation. If
[3:40:31] you've never invited him into your
[3:40:33] heart,
[3:40:36] but you know that you're not right with
[3:40:38] God, if you repent of your sins, we have
[3:40:43] a pool here.
[3:40:47] And
[3:40:48] they asked Peter, "Men and brethren,
[3:40:50] what must I do? I find myself. I find
[3:40:54] God on the outside.
[3:40:57] I find that I don't have the God living
[3:41:00] in me
[3:41:03] that you're confessing lives. I find
[3:41:06] myself short. What must I do? Repent
[3:41:11] and be baptized
[3:41:14] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:41:17] &gt;&gt; and ye shall receive the gift of the
[3:41:21] Holy Ghost.
[3:41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:41:26] &gt;&gt; It'll work for anyone that
[3:41:29] will believe it.
[3:41:38] There wouldn't be a minister anywhere
[3:41:41] in this age that
[3:41:44] would have any ministry
[3:41:47] that could keep any water from flooding
[3:41:50] in if it wasn't for the voice of William
[3:41:52] Brandham.
[3:41:56] &gt;&gt; That was the true revealed word of God
[3:42:00] &gt;&gt; for this hour.
[3:42:04] And you can't have the gospel
[3:42:07] without having that voice.
[3:42:09] &gt;&gt; Any man that heareth my voice.
[3:42:15] That's what we're built on, a God
[3:42:16] that'll stand behind his word. So I want
[3:42:20] to encourage you. Don't be discouraged
[3:42:23] with yourself.
[3:42:25] Don't be discouraged with your past. If
[3:42:28] there's something in your heart
[3:42:31] that wants to change your past, invite
[3:42:35] him in.
[3:42:43] &gt;&gt; He will come
[3:42:46] &gt;&gt; and suck with you.
[3:42:48] &gt;&gt; That's a promise.
[3:42:50] Lord, richly bless you. I hope you feel
[3:42:54] a desire in your heart to move closer to
[3:42:56] God.
[3:42:58] We want to know what our path forward.
[3:43:00] Our path forward is Jesus Christ
[3:43:03] &gt;&gt; living in our lives. Christ in you, the
[3:43:07] hope of glory. If the same spirit that
[3:43:11] dwelt in Jesus Christ dwells in you,
[3:43:14] it'll also quicken your mortal body.
[3:43:17] Let's don't live without him. Let's
[3:43:20] invite him into our lives. Let's apply
[3:43:22] the token to our home.
[3:43:25] Let's let him live.
[3:43:29] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[3:43:31] &gt;&gt; And he'll do for you exceedingly and
[3:43:33] abundantly above what you can even ask
[3:43:36] or think.
[3:43:39] There's no time, no place ever to end a
[3:43:42] service.
[3:43:45] But we do have some food next door if
[3:43:48] you'd like. We have sandwiches, ham and
[3:43:50] turkey sandwiches, and some leftover
[3:43:54] pizza.
[3:43:56] You're all welcome to go there,
[3:43:58] fellowship with one another, encourage
[3:44:01] one another, lift one another up. Don't
[3:44:04] be silly. But if you talk about him, he
[3:44:07] draws nigh.
[3:44:10] &gt;&gt; If you keep him on your thoughts, he
[3:44:13] stays with you.
[3:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you dedicate yourself,
[3:44:18] Lord, from this night forward, I've had
[3:44:21] my moment.
[3:44:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not going back.
[3:44:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:44:26] &gt;&gt; I've come too far to go back.
[3:44:30] I'm going to go forward.
[3:44:33] Tonight, I purpose in my heart, I'm
[3:44:36] going to go forward and serve God. I'm
[3:44:39] going to get rid of some of that stuff I
[3:44:41] got going on. And you watch, God will be
[3:44:44] with you. He'll help you. He'll guide
[3:44:47] you. He loves you. He's your father.
[3:44:51] Amen. Don't we sing a song something
[3:44:53] like I'm not going back or I won't turn
[3:44:55] back or
[3:44:57] you know that song? I don't.
[3:45:01] But we can sing it. Do you have your
[3:45:02] mic? You got a mic? We can sing it.
[3:45:06] Let's let this be our purpose. This is
[3:45:08] our dismissal song. Let's just pray for
[3:45:11] the food right now. our heavenly father
[3:45:14] for the sandwiches you provided. We ask
[3:45:16] you that you bless them to us
[3:45:19] that you bless the rest of our services
[3:45:21] coming. Father, anoint the ministers.
[3:45:24] May we receive the word. Father, we
[3:45:27] thank you for the quotes that we've
[3:45:29] heard tonight. Father, the things that
[3:45:31] your messenger told us, Father, that
[3:45:34] could bring us life and faith. Father,
[3:45:38] let that come into me. Father, let it
[3:45:41] pass from my mind into my heart and
[3:45:44] become the will of God in my life. Thank
[3:45:48] you, Father, for this time of
[3:45:49] fellowship. Bless these people, Father.
[3:45:52] We pray and thank you for the food you
[3:45:54] provided. We ask it in Jesus' name.
[3:45:59] Father, help us never to go back. Amen.
