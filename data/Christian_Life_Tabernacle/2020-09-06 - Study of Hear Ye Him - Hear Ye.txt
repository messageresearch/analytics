Description:
Study of "Hear Ye Him"
Br. David McGeary
Sunday Morning Service: September 6,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

========================================
[Music] so [Music] amen god bless you let's all stand and sing that this morning amen the time he was there [Music] [Music] all the times he was there all the time [Music] like me [Music] to jesus [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] uh [Music] oh [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] uh amen you love him this morning amen how we appreciate his love for us amen for the kyle if we could just come and open our service in prayer amen good to be gathering his presence amen certainly want him to move among us this morning to speak to us the words of life meant to bring about the power that we have needed for transformation amen dear heavenly father lord we come before you this morning lord humbled to just know that we're in your presence lord because your word promised that where two or three are gathered in your name there you'd be lord we're just grateful for your goodness and grace to us lord your mercy how just faithful you are to us lord undeserving lord but just thankful we ask that you'd be amongst us this morning speak to our hearts lord may we just leave this place closer to you lord may your presence just come in abundance lord guide us and direct us encourage us correct us where we need it more and bring us closer to you lord just be amongst us bless each part of the service lord we love you and we ask these things the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen welcome everyone in the house of god this morning our visitors will welcome you this morning as you're invited by mike foster so i'm reading amen good morning so as uh you know if you read the psalms you'll notice that there's a certain section of the psalms from 121 to 133 134 each one describes itself as the psalm of degrees and in jewish tradition each of these psalms were something that they recited that became their testimony on their journey to jerusalem as they got each step closer they would recite the next one of these verses as a witness as a testimony of who they were and as to prepare themselves for that returning to that place of worship one of those is psalm 126. you know what's interesting about psalm 126 is that you know if you do any those of you that are bible readers you know you'll know that there's a time in israel's history where they went through a period of captivity where they began to all the old landmarks broke down and they began to fight one another and they became a divided nation and then ultimately one by one they were conquered and taken over to some land of captivity israel went to assyria judah went to babylon and so it's a great event in their history the captivity but it's interesting when you read in psalm 126 when david says in verse 1 when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them with a dream this was hundreds of years before the captivity so here you have david speaking about the joy that comes from being delivered from captivity hundreds of years before any captivity happened to the children of israel you know and he also describes this people of of zion and he numbers himself with these people he says when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them in a dream and in verse 4 when it says turn again our captivity oh lord so here you have him speaking about a captivity that hadn't happened yet and of a people that weren't necessarily the people that he was a part of at that time because israel was not going through captivity so what is this you know here you have david rejoicing and sin and laughing and joy about the freedom from captivity and this prayer to be delivered from captivity again what is this he's talking about well you know paul says it i think another way if you look at romans chapter 7 he describes a similar condition of captivity and deliverance and it says i find then a law in verse 21 when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members so here you have both david and paul talking about a captivity that they seek deliverance from you know it's interesting he describes zion we looked at this a couple weeks ago zion is described in the scriptures of many things but among them is it's a people with whom god is pleased to dwell and so here you've got both david and paul numbering themselves among those people and the people with whom god is pleased to dwell are the people that long for and rejoice at the deliverance from their captivity paul goes on to say in verse 24 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord you know and in fact it's paul later says in ephesians 4 which you know you can go and look this up in fact in verse 1 he describes himself as a captive again a captive to jesus christ but in verse 8 he says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive so the very captivity that these men longed for deliverance from was itself taken captive by a work that was done this is that people that he speaks about those people that people that are talking about that transformational experience when their captivity is led captive and interesting when paul says that he's quoting david because david actually said that in psalms 68 18 he said thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou has received gifts for men so when you look at psalm 126 i i pray that we're not looking at that with the historical lens of these are jews talking about a captivity release that happened hundreds of years ago but this is a man who numbered himself among the people of zion who was celebrating the moment when his captivity was led captive this is our testimony this is the testimony of a people of zion who are speaking of a transformational experience do you remember the effect of having your captivity led captive did it feel like you were in a dream that you could not believe that this captivity was over i like some of the things he says here he says in verse 2 he says then said they among the heathen and this is psalm 126 the lord hath done great things for them how many of you were surrounded by worldly people that there came a moment in your life like something's changed with this person and here's paul celeb or it's david celebrating the same thing and then in psalm six he goes on to say he that our psalm verse six he says he that goeth forth and weeping bearing precious seed you remember that time maybe at an altar somewhere where you were weeping and that seed was awakened right you went forth with weeping bearing that precious seed and at the end of verse 6 shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him so when you leave an altar and weeping bearing that precious seed there comes a day when you come forth rejoicing with that fruit from that seed as we read psalm 126 this morning just a short psalm that's our testimony that's the testimony of the transformational experience of a people of zion that who's with whom captivity has been set captive so let's read that together if we can psalm 126 it says this when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen the lord hath done great things for them the lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad turn again our captivity o lord as the streams in the south they that sow in tears shall reap enjoy he that goeth forth and weepeth beareth precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him r amen god bless you may have your seats [Music] amen let's sing kfc man let's sing when i see the blood i'll pass over you amen oh and christ [Music] is [Music] over here [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause]

king went out and all the kingdom he watched how the people treated them and everything but all the time he was out there he was the king amen that's that just thrills me and he knew that he'd return back to his castle one day and take over his rulership and all that he learned and and i i like that i'm i'm a child of the king i'm going home here pretty soon i live in my mansion and i i i i'm longing for that day let's approach him in prayer our heavenly father we just ask that you would bless us this morning and be with us and help us that your spirit would be our portion today that you would take the wisdom that you stored up in this hour and that you would break it forth to us in the time of need for we know every answer lies within your word and we just long for you to direct our hearts to what it is that you've spoken and the promise that applies to our time we have to meet each need this morning and just be mighty in our midst today for we ask it in jesus precious and

you to protect her in your mighty and precious name may your love and your mercy and grace be upon her in jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen thank you god bless you today isn't the lord wonderful thank you the musicians today were thankful to be here he's gonna have a little uh i guess we call it a bible study or or just go through some scriptures and and uh read some statements to you and try to present a picture of the path that the lord is taking his church down and i hope it is inspiring to you so if you have your bibles let's go ahead and stand and turn to the 17th chapter of matthew and we'll read in the fourth and um fifth verse of the 17th chapter of matthew and we know that the setting of this story well and uh and it it this is where and we'll just start and read at the at the um start the first verse and after six days this is matthew the 17th chapter and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bring them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignant was white as the light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah talking with him then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if that will let us make here three tabernacles one for the one for moses and one for elias but while he yet spoke behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him amen god bless you you may be seated this morning we're just going to take a little moment this morning to read some statements and talk to you a little bit about what's on our heart and i we know this story and brother i'm in talking about this he makes a statement that really stuck with me i'm going to be reading out of the message here ye him preached and spoke spokane washington 7 11 and 62 but he said peter had experienced this great supernatural uh event and immediately uh he got excited and uh that's common for people to get excited when the supernaturals there but we also see another pattern that's very common and that is that all of a sudden peter started to come up with a program amen let us build this and let us build that and let's do this and our messenger said i'm so glad that god cut him off could you imagine the path and the direction the church would have been on or the path that it would have taken but the cloud come about and overshadow and spoke this words this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased this is where i dwell and hear ye him and that's the text that uh was used was hear ye him and i thought that is a a a really good practice is to hear the lord to hear uh from the lord and especially in this time that we're living in uh i i've we know that uh with all the confusion that's going on and all the economic news and the news of the mass plague that's upon the earth and and all the excitement and viewpoints and and the different interpretations and different ways to live and and it's just such a a a time of uncertainty that people begin to look for answers uh they're they're they're they're almost forced into making decisions their hands are are being forced what should i do what where should i go should i look for a different job should i wait it out to keep this job should i should i send my kids to school should i not send my split to cool should i uh go see my parents or not see my parents and it breaks my heart when i i read stories of tragedies where somebody becomes ill or becomes sick and and their loved ones can't go see them because of a a policy you know but yet they will they will put gowns on the nurses and gowns on the doctors and and none of them can do any good but at least a loved one could bring comfort to do something so i am i'm a i i get upset at some of those things it breaks my heart i i sit back and i think of myself if i wouldn't be able to go see my mother or what that would that would hurt me so and all these these pressures that are are coming on now you might not you you might not feel sometimes like you're under pressure but we tell the the story of a frog you place in the boiling water and the water just gets warmer and warmer and warmer and the frog just adapts adapts and dabs and after a while he doesn't even know to jump out of it because the the very pressure working on him in in the fashion that it worked on it begins to affect your thinking when you look around and and you're trying to reach out to find data you're trying to reach out to find answers you're trying to look out to find circumstances until you start listening and listening and the more you listen to different things that you hear and all those things begin to have an effect on us and they begin to uh they begin to uh uh press in on us and we're using we're using what that we hear what that we read what that we see what the the buzz is going around we start to grab to those things and gravitate to those things and we use those things as information we use those things as decision tools we look at what other people are doing and we take their example and so it does it creates uh it creates a real uh a pressure on us and it's that pressure that causes people to do things pressure will cause people to do things that they normally wouldn't do it causes us to make rash decisions and and not wait it out and and and think it out but uh that's why that this is such a an important statement hear ye him hearing him that what a situation these men were ready to move they were ready to make a choice they were ready to make a decision they were ready to start something do something whatever it was they said it's good to be here they're excited and they get they get in that place and they just feel i've got to respond to this i've got to react there's something that i've got to do there's something that i've got to participate and the cloud of glory came down and shined about him and spoke to him he said this is my beloved son hear ye him now isn't that really the best person to hear when you think about it that this is the creator of heaven and earth this is alpha and omega the beginning and the end everything that was made was made by him nothing that was made there was nothing made that that he was not the maker of he knows the beginning from the end he he knows what's coming he knows what's transpiring and not only does he know these things but he's made provisions for his own when abraham and his family were in israel and there was a great famine coming god knew that he everything was absolutely uh god had his hand in it and so he he went out and he he he took joseph and had him thrown in a well and had him taken off to egypt had him thrown in prison they had him to interpret a dream had him come to pharaoh everything you have to say was orchestrated so god could save his people because he knew that through those people would come our savior amen it's hard to sit back and think that the whole thing that went on in egypt the whole transport uh uh leaving their land and going into egypt and then being brought into slavery and the great deliverance that worked all that was done for me it was you say you're awful uh that seems awful bold but nevertheless god had to bring us to this day he had to have you sitting here because he had your names written on the lamb's book of life he he knew you and he knew he had to have you and he knew you had to be manifested and he made provisions all down through time to come through the prophets and the apostles and through sunday time and diverse manners he spoke to his servants by the holy spirit and they prophesied and they wrote and he prophesied of the promises that would be here and the day that would be be here he did all that for his children because he knew what the end was going to be he knew what it was he was going to accomplish and he made provisions all the way down and and so he instructed those apostles peter james and john there and he said now hear ye him you know we ought to all have a place and a time set aside to hear from god we really should and we should know that he's a god that wants to speak to us and really talk to us and he wants to be our god he is our god and so we just like duke it brought me to this sermon and act and to me it's just such a beautiful uh sermon as we read some statements from it to you and i know i'm not a very good reader and i ask you to bear with me you know i'm not intelligent by any means but god's still a god of grace amen so let's look as he says now peter called it the holy mountain because the holy god had been on this mountain and before god does anything usually on earth he usually speaks it out of heaven first so before god does anything on earth he usually speaks it out so we know that as being the word of god so if god is the head of our lives if he's the head of the body if he's the shepherd then before he usually does anything on earth even in your life he has spoken it out in his word that's why it's so important to us to find that place in the word of god to read our bibles to pray to hear ye him he said now did you ever notice that he always speaks from heaven first the supernatural always manifests itself and then comes down and to the people if you notice before israel was called out of egypt now moses tried to do that believing that he was the person that was given the message now i say this if i could say this to myself maybe in in a way we know that we're a people we've been talking about this that war of people that are chosen in this day it called and elected we've heard the message and we know that we're a people that are to be restored that the faith that our fathers had that wrote the book of acts is supposed to be returned to us and and that that is a marvelous promise but we have to understand that there there's the thing that always gets in the way is our intellect and i hope by just reading this that you can uh see this he said he he knew that he was that he was the person that was given the message but he had tried to do it by his own will and by an intellectual standpoint he said but before the time was right now that's what intellect always does intellect always messes up the timing you can see it's right you can see what it says it and you have uh the intellectual understanding of it and moses had that and that's what he did he tried to do it from an intellectual standpoint but before the time was right now that's why it's so important when we say hear ye him because he's the holder of the time he's the holder of the time and a sheep doesn't produce it doesn't manufacture wool it bears wool in its time you can't go out to a flock of sheep and say now sheep hurry up and grow some wool i have an order here and you could try to feed them what you want to feed them you can try to do whatever you can but there's a time and a season that that bears its fruit and when it's out of that time and it's out of the season it'll never produce the fruit that god intends it to produce we could go into a long discussion of latter rain and former rain but i believe that god's got a time for everything and he has a way of doing uh things and i think that's what we want to be interested in young people you've got job decisions to make you've got you've got relation decisions to make okay we have financial decisions to make and sometimes we don't give them the regard that we should uh give them but they're deported decisions in our life every single decision that we make bears a consequence good or bad it has an effect many times we think our decisions only have effect on ourselves but they have an effect on our friends they have an effect on our our children they have an effect on our parents they they have an effect a broad effect because we are interconnected people we are a family and even a decision within a body of believers can have effect on that body it can cause a lot of wondering or doubts or or or decisions and and and sometimes we make decisions and and we have to weigh those decisions and we watch those decisions and that's why one of the zeals for the age is to say i was wrong i made a decision and i thought it was the right thing to do and we tried it out but it didn't work out and then i got to come back and and and so there's there's a great value in uh in our decision making to understand that there is a right time and you know even in the many times the uh we were taught when when brother brown would have a vision and he would go there and he would have to wait till the portions of that vision fell in their place because it was the right time and so let me say it this way intellect many times gets us out of the timing of god and that's what we want to do we want to be in step with the father we want to be in step with the movement of the holy spirit we know that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord so many times we know the step but it's hard to wait on the wind it's hard to hear the voice as now now now's the time to move now's the time to go now that unction of the spirit leads you you sit there and you contain all of it within your mind and you can see it you can study it you can read the quotes about it but that still doesn't make it the right time there's only one that holds the time in his hands and that's god himself that's why many times it's the test of time it's time tested memorials you're believing god for your healing and years go on trials go on you do everything you can in satan battles and battles and battles just remember one thing god has got the time in his hands he's the only one that can say time is no more okay and that's just such a a wonderful place but he said now he said but when the time got right now hear ye him when the time got right so you know it intellectually okay you know it's there you you've got it down in your mind you can see it it's all there but you can't act on that intellect it's hard to wait on the lord but those who wait on the lord will renew their strength they will rise up and fly they'll become eagles and they'll move past into the heights he said but when the time got right there was a visitor came down from heaven and it was god himself amen when the time gets right you will have a visitor from heaven in your life and that's why it's important to hear ye him you will have the visitors because we know that the word of god teaches us every time that there's a problem every time there's a trial every time there's a sickness every time there's a need of deliverance god within his own attributes has the characteristic that causes him to go by that need said i have need to go by there he had need to go to the woman at the well he sat there waiting for her he had need to be there because the time had got right and okay and and that's what you you know you when you sit before the lord and you lay something out before him just know that he says when the time comes right there's a visitor that comes down from heaven how many believes he'll do that for you too sure he will everybody's trying to force our hand everybody's trying to force a decision every time but if we can be still and know that he's god and we can sit there and we can hold this one thing in our heart the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the lord he is mindful of us he cares for us he promised us he wouldn't leave us nor forsake us it's just we have such a battle so many times with the our intellect because our our intellect sees things it understands things but it's so important for us to bring our lives both naturally and spiritually into the timing of god god's got a time for your life he's never left you he's never forsaken you he he will he will be there for you he never failed he came to the burning bush and he spoke to moses before he sent him out i believe that every man before he goes out on the field to preach the gospel ought to first have an experience with god before he goes because in this intellectual day as the bible tells us will come this day that they'll be heady you know in other words they use their their brain they'll be they'll be heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof okay and and this is what we're interested in we're interested that the power of the gospel comes back into our midst that we're not having the this message can be you can teach this message mentally and have mental stimulation wow i never seen that wow i've never put it together like that wow wow you know and what it doesn't uh it doesn't do us any good if it doesn't produce a power that goes with it the kingdom of god is preached in power and demonstration of the spirit and i'm afraid that uh we've relied on the intellect to try to produce that power and it's never produced that way the power is only produced by the visitation of one coming down from heaven and speaking to the heart of the person power is given by god himself now we just want to go just a little bit this morning in this lesson he said and they've got intellectual giants in the world today that can almost explain away everything that god said to be true or they take it from a theological standpoint intellectually and if you just take your own mind of thinking and reasoning like he did in the beginning they can explain everything of the bible away from you now i just feel to inject this intellectually i believe one of the things that's been taught to the church that has been so detrimental was that after we've tried everything else after we've tried you know the the special herb uh plant from the deep in the bottom of the ocean that that produces the secret grant green algae that if you take it four times a day for the next three months you'll get well or whatever miracle pill miracle oil miracle plan miracle diet after you go see the specialist that sends you to the specialist that happens to have another specialist everybody's in on the pie everybody's getting the cut everybody's turning you into merchandise why has it happened to the church that god's become our last resort why why does it got to the point that it's after we tried everything else and everything else fails then we miserably with no faith crawl to god and start begging i do not believe that was the vision that the lord had for his church and that was not the faith that was going to be restored in this age this is the faith that we want purple green algae i have none a specialist or a referral to you i have none a psychologist or an exercise program i have none can you imagine peter had that day saying oh i know a therapist why don't you go down to 3434 dungeon street and there's some guy down there that i know that'll put you on the rack and he'll stretch you and bend you and twist you and maybe if you just keep at it for a few years you'll get better i want to say intellectually this is right out of the word of god intellectually we've let great spiritual minds because they want control the nickelodeon spirit wants to control the power in the church they want it to come through the pulpit they're the ones that want to lay on hands they're the ones who want to determine who gets healed they're the ones that wants to make the discernment whether it's of god or not it's not what he said and what does he say that dude they'll explain it all away but he said silver and gold have we none but that which we have by that which i have by that which i possess i say unto you rise up and walk we're never going to see the supernatural as long as that's our approach when he's not first on the list he's last on the list i'll guarantee you you'd get a lot more benefit out of the doctor if you prayed through if you've got the faith and the lord spoke to your heart and said go to this doctor he'll help you then you won't see that doctor you won't see that piece of paper on the wall you won't see that little weird thing he hangs around his neck or whatever he has on his head you won't see that you'll see christ standing in that man willing to perform a service on you that god has ordained him to do but why put god on the back end but that's what intellect does it explained the concept away from us is that miracles can happen first we got miracles happen last brother wait the last thing we look for you don't think we got to rise up i mean we're not we don't want a fake thing do we we want the real gospel he said he says and they can explain everything of the bible away from you ask and you shall receive but if a man or a woman has ever been on the back side of the desert in those sacred sands where no intellectual can stand and there comes in contact with the living god no devil or scientist or anything else can ever explain that away you were there that's the key you were there not mama not daddy we know that we've heard that over and over again but that doesn't mean anything until you look at yourself and you say have i had a backside of the desert experience have i heard him hear ye him that's the instruction of the father from heaven in any decision that's ever made the first thing god wants you to do is hear the word that's the launching point of every decision you'll ever make and i know i've told you this before but you know success and failure is launched from the exact same spot everybody comes to that spot where either failure or success lies in front that is a time that you need to hear him when you're facing things that's when you want to hear him and that's the instruction from the father to all his children because i just heard you all testify i am a child of god oh were you lying liars no i believe you somebody looked at me and they thought prince's bride i don't know why but that's okay no you're not you are we went over that a week or so ago the evidence of election but what he's trying to bring us to and he's trying to get us to understand that there's this the part of our intellect that we have to move to is we've got to hear what that he's telling us and he says hear ye him so know that he says you've been there it happened you know it's the truth there no one can take it away from you you've meant god and a believer that god in every age sent forth a messenger always first meets that person on sacred ground because it's got to be so okay we're talking about the restoration of this power we're talking about this church being restored what was the event that caused this church to be birthed is they were in that upper room and they came on that sacred ground and they meant that pillar of fire they meant that experience you meant god and i believe that in every age god sends someone forth the message always first meets that person on the sacred ground because it's got to be so and now remember if god ever deals with one man one way he's got to deal with every man every way if he men a messenger on sacred ground he's got to meet every son and daughter on sacred ground you are entitled to that sacred ground it's a gift of god from you he welcomes you to that sacred ground he paid the price for you to come on that sacred ground he's he he's there for you knock and it shall be opened seek and you shall find come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and i'll give you rest that sacred ground is a place that he provided for you to come meet him to be endued with power from on high let's just read a little more because he said there's too much of evil there's too much of evil to try to explain all the supernatural away and where there's a supernatural god there's going to be supernatural things happening because he is super natural so where there's a supernatural god there'll be supernatural things happening so if that supernatural god is in our midst we ought to be an expectation of supernatural things happening we can't keep sitting back to an intellectual expression saying it's true it's true it's true someday if the seed is planted someday it better produce figs else it's going to be cut down and thrown into the fire so we're talking about the right time i believe it's the right time in our lives i don't care if you're backslid i don't care if you've had trouble in the flesh i i don't care if you've had mental problems financial problems and everything and all things seem to be pressing against you i believe it's time to get on sacred ground i think he's inviting us on an individual basis to come into that presence to come to that burning bush to come to that upper room experience to come to that closet and have that spirit come down and meet you and take leadership one of the last messages brother bran preached was leadership the importance of hearing ye him now god spoke first to moses before a supernatural thing taken place in his miracles what a beautiful thing to know you don't have to go out god speaks god visits god entertains god invites he invites you to talk it over come reason with me let's sit down and talk though your sins be a scarlet i'll make them white as snow cast your cares upon me cast your burdens upon me i care for you well i want to be i watch the kind of person i want my life i don't want to go face this all alone here god was standing there he was doing exactly what he asked them to do now in the father's great heritage where he had he had many hired men working for him now this is a little teaching here and i hope it don't hurt but i just want to make the point to get faith started right and i think that's important if we've had all this intellectual that's absolutely moved god to the bottom of the ladder and you know why he's there because we're afraid we're not sure who we are we're not sure what we're supposed to be doing it's kind of like have you ever started a new job that first couple of weeks on the new job you're tiptoeing around you don't really want to jump in and do too much you don't want to offend nobody yeah you know what i mean and and you just you know you're trying to get used to it you're trying to find the routine you're trying to understand how it works out so you can get involved that that's the way it it it seems some times you know but you want to get started outright and that's what we've got to do we've got to get back and start out right so when we get started we'll be on the right foot now why haven't we've had the things going on that should and i'm not saying we're not occasionally sprinkled with a miracle or a blessing i'm not saying that we don't get so desperate that people finally touch the hem of his garment but i really sincerely believe that god is wanting more from his church i i'm not let's take that word away wanting more he has more for his church amen he's got more that he wants to share more that he wants to give more of the kid he wants to participate he said and so if we start out we'll wrote us now he says notice when a baby's son was born into a family or to this father he was born a son so now what's he separating he's separating this man he's separating all his workers and all the people that are laboring from sons and daughters may i put it this way all the people that are laboring all the people that are worshiping separated from elected bride a separate group a separate blessing a separate gift he says he's born a son but yet he had no inheritance just as a son now there's where i think that we full gospel people let down a little bit on our doctrine see we take a person and say well now he's filled with the holy ghost he speaks with tongues that's it no you've only just begun you've just been born into the family that's all that's the reason today our churches is not progressing the way they should be and i i would think after 50 years in this message that let me take this personally i think after 50 years in the message i feel like i should have progressed farther than i have you place yourself in the equation is there a hunger in your heart for more if there's a hunger so if we if we know the hungers there and we know that we may have been going about it the right way the maybe the wrong way that maybe we didn't get started on the right foot then we can stop and hear him and get our course readjusted which might mean a few adjustments in our lives and the reason i'm reading this is i don't want you to feel this is personal from me i want you to understand this is the messenger drawing this picture i think that after this great revival that swept the world in these last few years i would think the saints of god ought to be in the heavenlies everywhere with the power of god going into hospitals and everywhere else and great signs and wonders and miracles taking place but he can't get the people to stand still long enough if you sow denominational seed you'll reap denominational harvest that's exactly that's what we've done if we've sowed intellectual seed we're going to reap an intellectual harvest we know the mysteries we know all these things and paul's telling the church though you know all the mysteries though you speak with the tongues and angels if you don't have the love of god in your heart you're nothing what did you say what does love have to do with power love is the motivation of every miracle that's ever been performed if you want to sign then you're missing this whole boat this is about the love of god being shed abroad in the hearts of his church i'll try to hurry but we that's exactly what we've done well well well what have we done we've added members got bigger churches bigger memberships but what we need is quality not quantity that's the trouble that's hunting of the bride today that's the hunting of the bride today we've got members and the bigger we get the more we think god's with us but we've got to be those members in particular that's the trouble that's the hunting of the bride today eliezer had an awful time finding quality and then to get her ready to go was the next thing after he found it so that's the next thing to do we're hunting for that now the holy spirit god's servant eliezer was hunting for that quality that genuineness that something that would take back on the word that won't take back on the word of god it'll stand there live or die and say it's truth god said so that settles it look at what he said he said the church went after members i don't care come on come to my place we don't care we if you if you come in then you're a believer we're glad to accept you it's just a general blanket and and and and we become happy with members and we think god god's not moving in members god's manifesting in members people that are performing his word keeping his word believing his word applying the token we don't see god move the way it should be moving because we've taken the token off of our homes we've taken the token off of what we read we take the token off of what we fellowship we take the token off we put the token we don't even have it on the door post we've washed the door post and we've invited in the music we've invited into tv we've invited in everything else and if you listen i'll read and and we wonder why we've got questions because god's a god of principle he can't cross his own word now we've been trying to get him across intellectually but he's he's looking for that he says that's the problem with the church he says getting her ready is another thing he says we find out what kind of person that's going to be before he has an inheritance now let me read that notice in the old testament now this boy when he was born into the family the first thing the father did after he got old enough to begin to be taught now his son when he's born certainly he's the he's the family name he's got it but he has no inheritance now we find out what kind of person that he's going to be before he has an inheritance now remember our inheritance is the power of god that's what our inheritance is our inheritance is the works that i do shall you do also now remember power apart from character is satanic so before the church receives the power it's got to be tutored by the holy spirit to see what kind of character this person has don't think it's strange if god starts dealing with your lives don't think it's strange if he starts cleaning up your lives don't think it's strange that he starts convicting you and teaching you and condemning you of the sin that's in your life he wants to clean us up because he's got an inheritance that he promised he would pass off let me just finish here and i i think you've got the point he says he gets a real trainer someone that'll be honest somebody that'll teach he said now i wonder today that when god has called his pentecostal church about 50 years ago and when he called the church at the beginning what kind of tutor did he put over the church he sent the holy ghost the holy spirit to be the tutor the holy spirit is the tutor hear ye him amen you've got to have a heart and ears for the holy spirit when the time right he speaks he comes he directs he leads he tithes we've got to understand the holy spirit we have not substituted it with intellectual teachings of ministers who spend all day long studying in the scriptures and putting quotes together and drawing these great pictures and these great the teachings and and everything and we sit there and we feed and feed we've got to have some personal contact here we've got to be filled with the holy ghost we've got to individually be led we've got to have the spirit of god moving in our heart we've got to be hunger for the spirit of god we have to understand that before we get our inheritance the holy spirit comes and tutors our lives it's not it's just what does it just say i've got the holy ghost if you don't ever hear them you don't listen to him you don't set sight time for him he says come unto me i'll give you rest i'll talk it over on fellowship so what we're talking about we're not talking about we're talking about the church of the living god that has promised to come into a fulfillment of placing a positioning a receiving of the things of god and but we've got to understand that in order to get there the holy spirit has got to tutor in our lives he's got to make attitude adjustments thought adjustments habit adjustments spiritual adjustments do you welcome the tutor do you welcome the spirit to come into your lives and teach you and lead you and guide you in all truth and righteousness i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again i'll be with you even in you and i'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness we've moved the tudor out of the church you've got to get your personal tutor back what happens when a kid doesn't do very good in school you get him a tutor what happens when the church is falling behind where they should be what would i what would i ask for i'd say we need a tutor come holy spirit come start dealing with lives stump caught dealing with hearts we're all fitted and joined let's get our priorities back holy spirit move on each person's life that their priorities are back where i'd rather be in the house of god than than on the job i'd rather be fellowshipping than entertaining i'd rather i'd rather be about the things of god so let's follow this son for for a moment he says and today we've twisted it around with bishops and cardinals and popes and everything else with all kinds of ecclesiastical ideas and dogmas that's added and took away from the bible till the people don't know what to believe right they don't know which way to turn now i don't want to be in that condition he said we've twisted it around don't give up your personal leadership to a personality or to intellect no matter how wonderful the person is don't give it up to me don't give it up to any of the other wonderful ministers in this church don't give it up to a minister online if you've got to go online and find some certain guy that just tickles your little pinky you're in trouble because you won't know which way to turn and god forbid if that voice was ever cut off or he went astray then where would you be at you've got to be anchored you've got to know that god sent a voice and that voice said you hear ye him he says the poor bunch of people are like sheep having no shepherd a bunch of geese without a leader that's right they don't know which way way to fly everything's just gone every way this says this way this one this way and why they don't know what to believe god sent to his church the holy spirit that's the tudor and that tudor will tell the truth before god amen he feeds and teaches the children the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god will judge the churches as i said a while ago by his word the bible said i felt that come to me the bible said here that god would judge his church by jesus christ that's right and jesus is the word so it's the word made manifest if christ still remains christ he takes that word and manifested amen there you are it's the word living amongst us coming to life that's what the tutor's for that's what the holy spirit's for is to get your life where he can come alive and come real and be manifested in you i just got a couple more statements and i'll just read them and i won't say now what do you think god would do today when the holy spirit comes and tells him that that in our churches that we accept dogma instead of his word what do you think we expect creeds and we accept creeds instead of christ what do you think he does when he comes up and says that his daughters has all bobbed their hair wearing shorts smoking cigarettes the bible says such can enter to misbelief you say it don't make any difference don't you let the devil tell you that if god said if paul said here in galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven preached any other gospel than which i preached let him be accursed why did it make so much difference even little thing of lot's wife even turning and looking over his shoulder turned to a pillar of salt you've got to take the word there's a letdown somewhere you've got to get back to the gospel back to christ back to the living word no not bypass it for something this way you've got to believe it how can you how can you say that blanket natives who knew nothing about god received the holy ghost and realized they're naked and these american women strip every year and claim to be singing in choirs and christians support supposed to be there's something wrong somewhere and it ain't with god or his bible you know that's the truth no wonder we can't have revival no wonder we can't press into this no wonder that things can happen the tudor comes the tutor comes before the father and shakes his head oh my that's terrible the way they're doing well that's the truth what's the matter some little ticket meal ticket or something or a little something that somebody's afraid to say or something that's god's word preach it or leave it alone so that that's what that so i'm i'm listening to what the messenger is saying and i want to hear them you understand i want to hear ye him so he says there's there's something stopping the power there's something stopping god moving there's something stopping for those things so we look out and we say well we've got members we don't need members we need the members that we have to rise up in quality to set the wings of faith we can do more with 50 filled with the holy ghost than 200 half backslid people all the time i didn't say all the way backslid i said only half backslid you know to stir us up a little bit to get us to look in the mirror do i need to do i need to start putting that token to my life do i need to start doing these things what's wrong in other words we've got to move on but let's close with this but but what if the holy ghost comes before the father and says how could we ever build a church upon something like that listen friends it's time to clean from the top of the pulpit plum down to the janitor down there and start over it's just like a bunch of you take a bird lay their eggs in the springtime the old mother bird can lay a nest of eggs but she don't ha but she don't have to be with her mate but she can lay them eggs and she can hover over them and she can turn them and she can stay there till she starves herself till she gets so poor she can't get off the nest but they'll never hatch why they're rotten they're rot right in the nest why because they haven't been with the rooster and that's what's the matter today we've just took in so many members and so forth and babying them here and babying them there we just got a nest full of rotten eggs it's time to clean the whole thing out and to get them people with the mate jesus christ with the word of god back in action and power then we'll have a revival that'll shake something and do something then you'll see christ right in on the scene on the power he cannot come as long as these things are blocking him that's right no wonder the tudor come up before the father and blushed says your church i know it says that but they don't do it you mean they're not they're not doing it the holy spirit goes up to the father and says they're not doing it and he says what they're not doing it no but did you hear the statement what is it that's blocking him we've got to get in this together there you are what a disgrace what a pity that must be before the father when the tutor comes up the holy spirit and brings that case he is our tutor we know that and the holy spirit wrote the bible the bible said men of old moved by the holy ghost wrote the bible so the bible is written by inspiration there's no private interpretation it's just the way it's wrote that's right just take it believe it act on it god will bring it to pass i never seen him promise anything but what he done it he will do it as he always does he says here comes the tutor up and what if he comes up to the father oh how he feels myself come up and say your son is progressing he's a chip off the old block as we would say in the south he's just exactly like you he's just interested in all the sick and afflicted he's so interested in the salvation of people he's so interested in all of this he believes every word you said you know what he's running the church just exactly like you'd run it if you were there you know the way your son runs when you when he when he was there he said i asked a woman one time in the prayer line are you a christian she said i would have you understand i burn a candle every night like that had anything to do with christianity burning a candle every night i said that's no more than slopping hogs every night that wouldn't be a bit more to me i said are you born again you know christ is your savior he become and he become real really real to you are you living in christ is christ living in you that day you will know that i'm in the father and the father and me and i in you that's it god living among his people that's the way and then we find out we take if a son had been a good son just exactly now remember he was born a son don't miss that he was born a son but year after year he progressed and he's constantly about the father's business he's done the work just exactly the way the father did and the tutor says oh that's wonderful tell the father well it's just exactly the way you'd run it if you were there he balled out this and he condemned this and he give this a place he done just exactly the way you would do no different just exactly it's just like you there it's your life in him sure you can sure tell a son of god because he was born after you see it does the same thing that's right your word never miss a word oh the father says that's wonderful and there is coming a day if this sun continues on there is coming a day when they call it the placing of sons then the father called the group of people together in the city and took his own son and dressed him in a lovely robe and set him over every everybody could see had a ceremony and he adopted his son that had been born in his house and placed him and when he did that the son's name after that was just as good as the father's name and on the check or whatever he signed them days in them days it was a seal a ring because made them couldn't write it was put a penitentiary offense to copy that seal and they had it on the back of the ring and they would mash it like that and he could wear his father's ring why his name was just as good as the father's was now that's what god's trying to get his church to to a place that where we are sons and daughters of god we are trouble we're letting everything now the world's trying to smother the real thing down it's trying to make the people as scared that's what god's trying to get the church to for your word is as good as the father's word and it takes a tutor it takes a cleaning out it takes an involvement and it takes a desire in your heart but it's a wonderful message if you if we understand it let's hear them let's start hearing what the prophet of god said and i'll tell you if i know many of us have loved ones that we want to see god do great things for well maybe it needs to start in us maybe it needs to start in our lives now i could preach this morning some great mystery and i spent a lot of my life doing that but i'm looking for a church that possesses the power not condemning themselves because they don't have it but going to a tutor and let the holy spirit mold us and make us into the character that he can entrust that power we're sons and daughters of god we have an inheritance and this is our inheritance the works that i do you shall do also that is the inheritance of the father that is the inheritance of jesus christ to the church you're born but you've got to progress to that we've got to come to that and the only way that we can come to that is to submit ourselves to the tutor and start letting that tutor work on us work on our attitudes work on our words work on our atmosphere we've got to start letting the tutor tutor us into our inheritance and how many believe that's your inheritance it's your inheritance amen and i'm i'm thankful that if i see something that's not happening that i've got a place i can go to and say what can i do better what do i need to do what is it that i can do to have my life brought to a spot where the spirit of god what is it lord i'm in the prophet of god prayed for something and it it didn't happen and he he went to questioning god he went to wonder and he went to cert searching he wanted to hear from god he said i'm so burdened in my heart i'm going to move to the north i'm going to move to the south i'm going to move here i'm going to go where i've got it i've got to talk to him and and i'm going to say this again and i preached it last week there's a reason that we've got to come in contact with this power and with these signs and wonders that are going to follow us there's a reason that we've got to see the supernatural moving in our midst because there is a supernatural event coming called the rapture and if we can't live in this supernatural realm we're never going to see that supernatural move it's imperative that he would restore back to us the faith of our fathers because the faith that's restored back to us which is the manifestation of the word of god living in you is what prepares you for the rapture you will never have an intellectual rapture it is a physical event and the rapture is a condition it's not a calendar time and he said when this church gets ready he's going to take her i would like to invite this morning the tutor of the holy spirit not the power of the holy spirit not sit here and scream at the sky until we all shout and scream not scream at the sky it can tell we can produce some sort of emotional outcome i wouldn't like to invite the tutor into our lives to start teaching us and prepping us for the inheritance that god wants to give us and i hope you don't think i'm crazy but i look on your face as i can see the election in your lives i can see the love of god that you hacked and that's what he said my sons and my daughters they're interested in the sick and the afflicted they're interested in lost souls they're interested in deliverance and he said there's just been something that's taking it away from us and that's because we've listened to too many other voices instead of hearing him i encourage you to take time each day if you can and spend a little bit of time in that message of the hour listening to that voice reading your bible making contact because god does nothing on earth unless he comes down and speaks at first and therefore i say hear ye him do you want to hear him amen let the tutor come into your lives i'm not saying you don't have the holy ghost let them start teaching you let them start praising you let them start letting you progress does any i need progression i need to progress do you all want to progress god bless you let's stand
