Description:
Pastor David McGeary
Sunday Evening Service: May 31,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

ordered by the Lord and father we certainly want our footsteps ordered we want to be willing to take the steps that you would have us to take we ask you to bless us tonight in Jesus precious name we pray bless you it's if you have your Bibles let's turn over into the Book of Joshua and let's read of that as a scripture there when I read this morning 13:1 because I guess it's been three weeks since I've ministered and and so I'm not going to try to go too long I'm going to give a preview of what that I would like to preach on Sunday and you know brother Branham II said that you know a good advertisement draws you in so either it'll be a good advertisement or a bad advertisement so if you don't like the what might come Sunday then I guess we'll have an empty but this is the most people I've preached to and in a while I was referring to that tape or program talked about that road sign you know and he said that road sign he said it really done it he said you don't want to go there and see a big old juicy steak on the picture and when you get there has anybody ever seen a hamburger from McDonald's that looks anything like the picture you know but but so if you think people are really craving something that's real so if you just bear with me this evening and and as we'll just try to do the best we can and fellowship with you around the things of God's Word now Joshua was old and stricken in years and the Lord said unto Joshua thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to possess Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be as a conceited you know I I enjoyed that verse of scripture and I kind of thought about it in a way that you know Joshua may not have realized that he was old and stricken in years you know but the Lord had to remind them that are old and stricken in years and there's still a lot of work to be done and I've always liked the book of Joshua because the book of Joshua as we know is a type of the Holy Spirit and and the book of Ephesians and those those books parallel together and you can see in them a lot of the working of the Lord and how God's does things it's always a blessing to you when you can understand how that God does things and and though why there is important to a believer is because if God ever does one thing one way he'll always continue to do it that way if you ever meet the requirements for a promise of God then that requirement is good every time it's meant you're not in wonderment of what what's going to happen or what's next or how it things changes that way the believer has something that the world doesn't have the world is always changing just then I believe that just in the last few months we've seen a scriptural can you open that for me I could use my teeth but I think that would be a little you take it all the way out for me would you all right thank you I believe we've seen things come to pass right before our eyes but a lot of times we don't know how to take the event and relate the event to the scripture and because naturally we we are people that we make supposition we are interpreters by Nature what we think things are what we think things mean and we had a nice fellowship with the young people and we were talking about truth and truth originated in the beginning okay and so the truth wasn't a consensus that people came up with truth is truth and it stands on its own in other words if we all agreed together in this room that this was an ice cream cone would that make it an ice cream cone no the truth of it is it's a box with tissues in it and that so that doesn't change so the truth could never changes and the truth was established in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was with God and when that word was made flesh Jesus says I am the way the truth the life so truth is something that's unchanging if it's something that we've got to find and line up with the truth we can't change the facts to change the truth that's called a liar one that will assemble the facts to come up with the answer in a conclusion that they want there's kind of a saying in business and that saying is that Liars figure but figures don't lie okay so that's the absoluteness of math and so the thing about the word of god is it's true and it'll come to pass and I thought we miss a lot of times the things of the word coming to pass but I thought of that Scripture okay and we know the scripture that they'll say peace and safety peace and safety and I just got the thinking about what the political climate was and what man was saying we are the most prosperous people than we've ever been this is a greatest we've ever been we're more powerful now in our military is more powerful than we've ever been we're safer now than we've ever been we've got more prosperity now than we ever had unemployment is the lowest it's been okay everything is going great and and people have making more money than their they've ever made and the scripture says that's their gospel peace and safety peace and safety but suddenly destruction comes and in just a matter of time 35 million Americans were out of work restaurants were closed businesses is closed and we haven't even begin to feel the effects of it because our government postponed the effects of it by telling businesses we'll pay the payroll if you don't lay them off but that day is coming do you understand that day is is coming the effects can be postponed but the truth of it cannot be so if the Word of God says they say peace and safety and they say this then sudden destruction comes that we have to realize that the destruction is going to come that there's going to be hardships there's going to be things ahead of us but we can be confident because we have something that doesn't change we have the Word of God and it doesn't change and so we noticed that that the the whole climate of what has transpired and and I thought it was marvelous because just as I looked at the wow this is this is absolutely happening you say am i a divine interpreter of the scripture no I say that the Word of God is interpreted when it comes to pass can one scripture be applied in many circumstances yes because God's an interpreter of his word but I noticed that that the whole country and everybody had went in to a survival mode and and that's all that everybody is trying to do is survive I noticed how that now that they're there wanting and this is what I kind of brought my attention to this that so everybody was locked down everybody went in the shelter everybody put on mass everybody was prepared for an intimate danger and that they were warned and everybody took heed to the warning and everybody went into what we called shelter and we didn't call it shelter we called it fellowshipping in place because it was the time for us to read our Bibles and listen to tapes and put on the music in the home work on the atmosphere and home work on our family skills and how would be nice to one another now that you have to see one another and so those those were things that we called it was a it was a time for us because we're not the people that are ever going to be bound by fear you know I mean we've got it we've got a job that's going to protect this but so everybody went into sheltering and and they they cut into a place of protection and so it first of all it came self protection and then anybody that was out helping sick people or having to help people or having to make contact with the public we called them heroes and up to me they're heroes you know what I mean frontline workers we even put a special acknowledgment to anybody who put themselves at risk and stepped outside of self protection self protection so people are great in the great mode of self protection so their their lives had come into how do I protect myself they bought hand sanitizer they bought gloves they bought masks and and I've looked all over masked to be able to provide masks for anybody who wants a mask I haven't been able to find a mask I even called the Long Ranger and he didn't have any mask though there's there's no masks anywhere you know so but we have a covering amen and that's what we're long but now it seems like there's the desire to get back to work and and this is kind of where my thought is going to go in the next few in the direction that we want to go in and it gets back to work and that what Joshua had told God had told Joshua there's still much land to possess there's still work to do and it doesn't mean that John because Joshua was going to go not as a type but as actually a physical leader that the work stopped and there's there's still work to do and it still is something that that we have got to realize that that the Lord has always had a work for his people to do and sometimes I feel that the enemy and if I was to do a type this virus to me was like a type of the enemy it was the enemy in a form but not only did it attack people physically in a portion of our population that's very dear to all of us and but it also put a mindset into people of a protection mindset and you put that mindset in the lady OC at church age and the spirit of the lady Oh see a church age it it it's a it's a spirit of self-preservation it's a spirit of people's rights and where if the spirit where man puts themselves and their personal well-being above the personal well-being of others and man makes they make associations and and they make affiliations and they make covenants and they make agreements with other people that they feel by entering into this agreement it benefits themselves and so connecting is the the spirit that's on Lady hacia and it's been there since it started it's the spirit of my rights and my preservations and it's what that I have need of and it's it's all about me me what can you do for me you know what I mean at the end and people cater to that and they make promises I'll forgive your debt I will give every American a thousand dollars every American should make so much money a week okay III if you elect me I'll give you that money of free wages well you know that's against the principles of God and the farther you get away from the principles of God the quicker the destruction comes but see everybody wants to affiliate and associate with something that is given to them to benefit them set that human nature okay and so we find that that's the this lady OC an age that we're living in this time that we're living in has come a time where people say I've got to do what's best for me best for my health to best for my circumstance Beth for my situation and very little thought goes into account of how what my effects have on anybody else could know people by nature don't want to know what the well-being of their neighbor is I just know that I don't want my neighbor's trash can on my side of the property line okay and I don't want his dogs putting his nose through my fence and I don't want this and I've got my property and I got my world but very little does it have in people's hearts anymore to really be concerned what can I do for my neighbor well you know what's the other person going through and even though that's one of the great Beatitudes that have been taught us if if somebody needs a coat give them your cloak also if they compel you to go a mile to go a mile also so I want to look at that from the viewpoint of what's been given us and and what approach should we have and it's time for us to get back to work and I want to talk about that and the next service is to come and I like to take this and start with a scripture of found in Luke the twenty-fourth chapter and the 49th verse and it says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high and so if we look at the this great promise that God gave the promise to his disciples that if they would go wait and they with no Terry they would be endued with the power from on high now the definition of in dude means provided with so they would be provided with a power from on high now if you look to the scriptures before that and if you look in the book of Acts to the time before that Jesus told his disciples that I am going to send you into all the world and you are going to be witnesses of the things that you have seen and so they were given a commission they were given instructions that I want you to go out and I want you to do the things that that and be and testify to the themes that I have taught you and so that's the first thing that he's asking these men to do is I have taught you things that are different than the law I have interpreted the law to you because Jesus was a prophet and a prophet is a divine and Turpin of the Word of God and so the Lord Jesus interpreted to them the law what really it was that Moses had written man had taken the law and they had turned it into an organization they had turned it into Sadducees and Pharisees and priesthood and man had put the mark his mark on the law so man had taken the law and interpreted the law to its self benefit life is what man does in every age if it created a hierarchy in the priesthood and it performed all the things that were never intended by the law because man had got a hold of it so you understand what is being said and and so he told the disciples now you are going to go be a witness because there was an exodus taking place there was a leaving of the law moving in to grace so under the law the man by his own strength by his own decisions by his own might had to keep the law and what kept man to help man keep the law was the punishment that went with breaking the law if you're caught in adultery take them and stone them you know there was all kinds if you don't pay your debt you have to put somebody into servitude you know a lot of people put their family into servitude because of their debt and they don't realize it their children go without because they put a lot of credit card debt they don't manage to their funds correctly they spend more than they mate and now they become in bondage to that they they they they without even realizing it their ear gets all and they become bonded and subject to their debt master and the scripture plainly tells us took to do our best - oh no man anything if that's why even when you buy a home they want you to put so much money in it they want you to build some equity in it so if you're not really just upside down and in debt and I'm not preaching about debt today but I just can't help but remind you it's it's a good idea not to get in debt okay it's just is and you can you don't want to become a servant of that debt and so man will buy by the consequence of the law served the law out of his own ability but now there was a Exodus taking place it was moving from the law to another form of leadership and that's what he said when the Spirit of Truth has come when the comforter has come he will lead and guide you in all truth and righteousness so no longer was there a written law that people were under and they had all these priests and scribes and Pharisees interpreting the law and arguing the law and making defense and breaking into little cults and little things like like these things but now there was a promise that there was going to be one that came and that was going to lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness so there was an exodus that was going to take place from law to grace a change in leadership and so we we realized that that was promised to us and so I'd like just to read a little bit from the Easter seal and as we build here in just closing in a few moments God gave Abraham a promise so God gave them a promise right I'm going to send you the promise that I made with you that you would be endued with power from high you would be provided with a power from on high to carry out the instructions that I have given you that's right people have denominations they have to come up with their own way to follow the instructions but that was never God's intention he was always his intention to have the personal leadership over the believer by his spirit and not they have a group of fellowship that that put pressure on the believer or a group of ministers or ever binding anybody by the fear of consequence but he wanted to provide to them a power I want to hold that provided a power and and so he said now Abraham God gave Abraham a promise and abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the seal of circumcision God gives you a prom potentially that that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him in the end time so God gives us a promise right and what is our promise that this body will be raised up not this particular fleshly body that of these exact ions and stuff like that because that it has been prophesied to corn in the dust but he blows us and pulls the st. potassium and elements together and it creates for us an incorruptible body that the spirit that we are will will dwell in and so he says but he says but you see he says but you see you have got to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against it has been stricken off and you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours and every string on it belongs to you so God gives you a promise so that's what he told the disciples I give you a commission I give you a promise this promise is the works that I do shall you do also go into all the world preach the gospel and these signs and wonders shall follow them that believe you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you shall take up deadly thing and it will not hurt you you shall lay your hands on the sick he shall speak and you'll cast out devils these things that's the promise so in promised form you potentially have that but now God wants to give you something that can prove to you that you are the possessor of that promise that you're not just making cling to it this is my property well I know her brother that a man told them that this property was his and he said I'd like to sell it to you so you can build a church on it and I want to give you a good deal and the brother should thank you brother that's wonderful how much do you want he said oh how about $100,000 oh that's marvelous gives him $100,000 one day he's standing out in the property praising the Lord for the property and what a great thing that God had done for him and a man showed up he says what are you doing oh he says I'm acting just like you know the scripture said every place that I put my foot is my possession and I'm walking on it and I'm claiming it and I'm praising God for every thing of it and and the man looked at me says well you've just taken your last step you get off this property else I'm calling the police wait a minute faith was there he believed the brother yeah the land was there but what was missing the abstract deed was missing he sold them something that didn't belong to him nope you understand that exactly what's happened with denominations and organizations and systems they sold the people something that doesn't belong to them it's not theirs so you can and and they so they try to claim the promises but they don't have the abstract that proves that they're the possessor of the promise Abraham had a sign in his flesh because he received this fleshly promise we should have a spiritual sign in our spirit because we've received a spiritual promise so that God gives the disciples something to prove to them that the promise that he had given them and the commission that he had given them that they now were the possessors of it I go to closings if I buy a property and I sit down at the closing or if I sell something and I you fill out a bunch of paperwork's about as thick as this book and you sign this and you sign that and you sign this and you sign you're not a terrorist and you can you sign all these things and and everything when it's all said and done they've covered every base they've made sure there's nothing no charge laid against it and they finally give you a deed that says this property has been passed on to this property and if we bear witness for it and and it's true and that gets filed at the courthouse now do you have something that you've received that proves that you are the owner and the possessor you just don't say I'm a possessor that is not faith every promise in the book does mine every chapter every verse every line you don't have to prove that he is the one that proves that's true if I sell the property I've got to prove that I am capable of transferring this property to you that I have the power I have the right I have the authority I have the ability I have to prove that I can make this promise if not it's a sham in that corrected denominational world that religious dogmas and creeds and everything is a sham because they can't prove that they've got the authority to make the claim that's why this message is so beautifully vindicated because the man that spoke the word was vindicated to show that he had the power to make the claim to be the divine interpreter of the word he says now let somebody try to put you off a land and say it doesn't belong to you with the abstract in your hand right you won't be able to do it when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract the abstract is the assurance it's a guarantee that everything that was ever held against you and you thoroughly repented hallelujah the property is bought and you hold the abstract for that assurance so you repent you confess your sins you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you've done everything now he's going to give you something he's going to do you or / buy to you something that answers and settles the questions I have been forgiven every promise in this book is mine because he sins down the Holy Spirit and seals the believer and baptizes the believer and gives them the possession of every promise in the book no longer is it saying I see the promise I know the promise is there but now this baptism this Stratton that is sent down I will not leave you comfortless comfortless is when you're in doubt comfortless is when you're caught in the middle coverless is when your hope between two opinions but if you could have something that settles the question I know I'm saved I know I'm secure I know I'm going to be resurrected I know it why because he sent down the baptism of the Holy Spirit he personally came and sealed me he personally came to me and provided me with a power he provided it have you ever went to a place and they said I'll provide the hot dogs and the hamburgers and you get there and there they are it's the proof of the promise I don't mean to make it so carnal but I want I want you to pick up on this is that if he makes a promise he has to give you an assurance he has to give you something that proves that every promise in your this book is yours and it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's not any motion not a sensation it's a provided assurance from him to you personally that every promise in the book is yours that gives the comfort that's there it's been in dude it's been provided go wait go tarry until you're provided with a power from on high that is cash read on if we're just laying some foundation to where we want to go let somebody try to put you off a land that doesn't belong to you tried to put you off a land and say it doesn't belong to you with the abstract in your hand so God gives you something that Satan can't come along every time and push you off the promise push you off your salvation get your eyes you know con on somebody else and never can you imagine me having the abstract in my hand and some little tweedily wishy-washy naysayer backbiter criticism come guy comes along it's just that long don't belong to you it belongs to him he's the guy that bought it he's the guy everybody in this town knows he's the real owner and you fall for that know you've got the abstract so what would you do with that abstract if you had do you take it to the highest court in the land and the Supreme Court would rule and they say this man it's got the abstract I don't care what the gossip is I don't care what the tradition is I don't care what the people thought he possesses that it's is well you got attention to this supreme throne of the Lord Jesus Christ and lay that abstract down performance a you gave me this abstract you're the one that gave me the assurance you're the one that said my sins were forgiven you are the one that said every promise isn't the book is mine and you gave me this baptism of the Spirit as a proof I know I possess this baptism so I know I possess everything that comes with it oh it's settled but it's not settled if you don't trust your abstract you know what will happen you'll never build on it you'll live in fear you'll never go forward you'll never do any works you will never carry out the Commission you'll never go forward with the promise because you're not sure it'll work I'm not sure I'm afraid man if I believe with all my heart it might not happen no law on the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and abstract that the baptism of the holy spirit has recognized us in Christ Jesus hallelujah can you imagine having the baptism of the Holy Spirit in your life and not realizing what it is that you possess he didn't say I'll send you to the upper room and you shall see a feeling no he said you shall be provided with a power that will allow you to carry out the Commission and do the work it wasn't them doing the work we call it the Acts of the Apostles but the prophet of God tools it was the acts of the Holy Spirit in the Apostles in other words it was the Acts of the abstract provision that God made to perform the promise hallelujah every act of the Apostles was the proof that the abstract had been given that their sins were forgiven they were chosen they were recognized identified and commissioned to do the work to do the work to get back to work they're commissioned to do the work Peter goes up there and he Selva says sam'l silver and gold have I none but I've got something it's an abstract it's a power that has been provided to me by the Holy Spirit God gave me this power I don't have this power in my son mighty Sal I was a sinner but he forgave my sins I was a coward but he changed that nature and made me bold something happened so silver and gold I have none but I have the abstract I have the power that I receive from him that has been provided to me to do the work rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ that was the abstract in action it was possession put to use that's where I'm headed Sunday the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a possession the abstract is a possession it is a power you possess the power is in the abstract the powers not in the claim without the abstract that claim is a deceit so what do you think the first thing that that good man should have done he says show me the deed show me the abstract show me that you possess it he didn't take it onward only Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words I came to you with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit I came to you possessing the abstract that was given by God to every believer that I've recognized and accepted that believes my word since when that we got to the place that we just accept enticing words that we we accept fine orientation and great explanations when have we got to the place that we start patting one another on the back I'm okay you're okay let's all agree we're okay that's a relief that it's our way like I said we should change the name to the church till we're right everybody else is wrong Tabernacle I don't care where you go I don't care if you're in a Baptist Church the Methodist Church Pest fruitarian Church if you have the abstract you have the promise and these works you shall do because I go to the Father and if I go to the Father I will not leave you nor forsake you but high personal pronoun will come again and I will send you the abstract the comforter the proof the abstracts the proof the powers in the proof is not in you it's not in your claim it's what you possess it's what's been given to you the Word of God says lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover people laid their hands on the sick all the time and people don't recover but you let a person that got the abstract who's got the Commission who's been given the power to fulfill the promise that person when that person prays it produces results I hope that I want to encourage us because I ask the question what are we building and they're good questions where are we going what now what do we do now you know we're doing we're going fishing now we need them to come walk in and say cast the net in other words get back to work get back doing what you're you're you did come back and so good let us read on him will close up he says and we have assurance to raise that he raised because potentially we have already raised in him do you understand this abstract everything does it's the seal of our resurrection it's the proof why try to claim that you're going to raise from the dead on an intellectual theology on a on a church doctrine on the church fellowship on an association of who you know when he is willing to give you the resurrection life in advance if the same spirit that dwelt in him dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal body so when he gives you his spirit he gives you resurrection to I said were possessors of the resurrection we have the abstract that we will raise with him because he's already showed that we've died with him and we've repented and we've passed from death unto life now he gives us something oh thank you lord he and dude Dow's you with power from high he provides you with a power not just an anointing but a possession not something that comes and goes now your possession can get stimulated and brought to your remembrance and you go to shouting praising God and we call that the anointing and that's what an annoying is if the stimulation but that stimulation can follow on people that don't possess the abstract they don't possess the proof of course you know where my questions going don't you you've got to know you've got the proof okay then just just finish I know I'm trying to finish the whole thing what does it do to our mortal body it turns our opinion and changes our notions what I know a lot of people that they need that abstract that change some opinions and some notions I like that song it'll make you love everybody you don't make you love your brother you know what I mean it's a sad day that you looked upon human flesh and judge it every time you look upon a man you're going to find fault our righteousness is as filthy rags there's none of us righteous but him could act like he provides the righteousness I'll give you the power I'll provide the righteousness he's our righteousness not us I possess it I don't know how you got it brother McGarry brother McGarry don't know how he got it either because he surely didn't earn it he surely didn't do anything for it the only thing I know is when I heard there was something here that said amen and then when he said if you believe I will give you a power from on high I said Lord I want that have I been worrying it against the flesh the flesh wars against the spirit and these two things are contrary one to another it's a constant battle but how do I know I'm not losing the battle I possess the abstract I'll not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you what is that abstract do it convicts me of sin it instructs me in righteousness the way to go it makes life miserable for me when I get out of the way but it don't quit like that song everything except he never stops he never stops I think it's working right or never stops never they just go on how he never stops and they're all jumping down till the point you're saying stop already but you don't you see it don't matter how do I know because the flesh is contrary to the spirit but the spirits contrary to the flesh also so I've got representation in the baptism of the Holy Spirit I've got representation that I've received the promise I've got representation so when he tries to kick me off of the land of my promise that God gave me I take the abstract I'll hold it up did he give it to me he says you don't deserve it that may be true but I've got it and you can't have it how it is now we can go toe-to-toe Satan but my Bible tells me if you resist them he'll flee amen we saw that this morning and brother Abraham's testimony it changes our opinion our notions it sets our affections on things which are above and the smoking drinking gambling the things that you used to do is dead it's beneath you and you are quickened in this quickening power and it brings your body unto a rapturing condition already whoo whoo the rapture means a lot to me I don't see nothing for this country that's going to do it any good but the bride leaving it and then it can be put out of its misery because you're the only things holding it together why so what's the quickening power it's the power that was provided to you to perform the commission notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me that's mother Brennan listen to me when that Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost received their abstract deed from God the baptism of the Holy Spirit the power that he promised to ndu him with sure it glorified their soul they screamed and they saw tongues of fire separate upon each of them and it also quicken their bodies till they couldn't even speak an earthly language anymore it quicken their bodies to a heavenly language the place they were going to be quickening power of God shook their mortal bodies so until they're entitled mortal language was transfigured and transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power what something it belongs if the Holy Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it shall quicken your mortal body we are quickened then by the power of the Living God so anybody in this building tonight that would confess to me that you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are a possessor of a power they're inseparable you get the land you get it the land now watch it what's he talking about the abstract this power I want when you think quickening power when you think abstract that's all terminologies for the baptism of the Holy Spirit what was the baptism of the holy spirit it was the power that God sent down to the believer to perform and possess the promise it's not a third person it's not in an emotional experience it's not a sensation it's a literal transference of his power to his church it's the passing off of power and authority see we've taught it as a I don't know what we taught it has but I'm just telling you how the Prophet taught it and believe me that's good enough for me now watch it it was also designed to give them after this abstract baptism the Holy Ghost quickening power it was designed to give them every promise that was on the grounds every promise that was on the grounds of God's Word in other words it just didn't give you the power it also gave you every promise every promise when you got that abstract you got every promise when you got the abstract you got the baptism of the Holy Spirit you received that big-name power not only did you get every promise but you got the power to possess and perform every promise because if he didn't what good would it be be worthless like someone to give you a dollar bill and the other side's not printed on it you can't cash it in just think how lucky you are excuse that word that's a terrible word forgive me for saying that edit the tape God's Word that was promised in the Bible that quickening power was given to them to quicken that promise to them so it's given to make the promises real to you therefore they laid hands on the sick and they were healed they spoke in new tongues they did great signs and wonders because that was in God's promise so when they received it they received the promise when they received it they received the quickening power to perform those promises so that's why they did it and when Jesus died to redeem us back to them that ground that belonged to the sons and daughters of God he demonstrated what God was and how dare we socialize that and put it into an organization we have no right to do that when he died he died to return that power to his sons and daughters and we have no right to socialize that oh this message may not be a denomination but it's certainly becoming a social event but that's not our evidence I know that they love us like they'll know us by our love one for another and that's good and I think one of the great compliments that our congregation gets from all around people come and said I feel the love I feel that people love one another look I want to add the next step to that I want to add the possession of the abstract now listen close as we close this evening the Holy Spirit today is hunting out honest hearts that will believe that message that message is the message that told the church the power that was provided to the disciples has been restored you believe that there's a restoration mesi the faith that was once provided to the Saints week we take the word the faith that they once had no it was the faith that was provided to them when was it provided it was provided when the Holy Spirit came when the abstract came when the quickening power came that was provided to them that's what quickened the promises to them that's what made them believe in the promises no wonder he said without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you shall not see the kingdom of God that's why the formula is repent the Word of God brings you under conviction repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall be provided a power from on high thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus a power an assurance a seal something that God's going to give me to do the works that I've been called to do for you are his workmanship in Christ Jesus for ordained unto good works that you should walk in them I can't I'm carnal I have a carnal mind the Lord says I'll fix that I'll send down a power and the power is going to change your opinion it's going to change your notions it's going to change your mind it'll put the same mind in you that was in Christ Jesus where you no longer look after your own but you look after the things of others hallelujah that will believe that message the message of this gospel is I died for your sins I will come again I will send you a power I will dwell in you I'll be with you even in you and the works that I do you shall do all the Holy Spirit is looking for young men young women everywhere that will believe that everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer and when you accept it in its fullness then God knows that you'll do it when you accept it he knows that you will do it I love that he gives you the abstract to that when he knows you believe it he knows you will do it he gives you the power to perform I wonder if he stopped with the power somebody told us the power is good enough the power in itself is nothing he said that if they'd have all the mechanics but till it gets that something that ignites that spark it don't move it gives you the abstract of that then every promise that's made is in your possession when you got it then every promise that was made is in your possession and the Holy Spirit has to quicken that to you oh my what kind of people should we be how wonderful to see God's great Holy Spirit here to do that power think of it the Holy Ghost itself is here to be bear record of this our jesus said so that's the same yesterday today and forever how dare any man to wipe that out of there the works that I do shall you do also these signs shall follow them that believe that is the assurance men I never meant to people that's possessed with insurance I bought something and by the time they wanted to sell me all the protection plans I figured they were selling me a piece of junk they won't even guarantee it that's insurance insurance is a guarantee there's only one pterence that God provides mankind and that's the baptism of the holy ghost individual not group when we see a group of people sitting together and those signs manifesting themselves that's the assurance that the abstract is there to vindicate that that's the property of God not our say-so when the Holy Spirit is there and that abstract is there performing the promises of God that's the assurance that that's God's people and that and that's the property of God one man claimed it was his property and he sold it and that man claimed it was his property and he would have sold it but somebody showed up I don't want to be a church without an abstract I want to be intellectuals if you possess the baptism of the Holy Spirit then by confession you possess the power and I'd like to read this scripture to you found in Joshua if you would turn back with me to the book of Joshua and Billy Billy if you would come please thank you for bearing with me and I could type this out into so many beautiful ways but the 18th verse chapter of Joshua Joshua 18 1 and the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was fitted before them and there remaineth among the children of Israel seven tribes almost like seven church changes huh which had not yet received their inheritance and Joshua said undo the children of Israel and this what I'm saying us tonight how long are ye slack to go possess the land which the Lord God of your father's have given me how long are we going to slack [Music] these are the questions that I'd like to maybe ask Sunday and start going forward with the 10 question in Joshua how are we going to slap when do we call upon the power in doubt given to us [Music] given to us from him from heaven when do we start using that power are we sure the evidence that we have this power do we know what it is and what it can do [Music] how many in here in claim they had the Holy Ghost you have power to say to this mountain be moved and remember that if it's a promise the power is given to perform the promise [Music] if I go forward I want to go forward with the abstract with the quickening power with the baptism the Holy Spirit you know if I have it I want to use it how long are you going to slap and not go take hold of the possession that was given to you how long are you going to believe and not use the power [Music] that you have [Music] I could tell the parable maybe I'll read that Sunday there was a God that gave talents [Music] one gave it to somebody else one went and used it then one buried it [Music] if you've got the power and the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's think about when's it time for us to use this power god bless you thank you for enduring with me and keep praying for me I can get better god bless you [Music] and then Cigna Jesus is my wonderful taste of glory [Music] Oh Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] they sing that song you can't do my mind I'll die believing they may not believe we could try it in at UFC [Music] whoa Satan Satan stands before you all like using me of sin the pressure is icing I know who might be around me [Applause] Oh in your world [Music] to me water background [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] wait [Music] around and see [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I knew the minute you glad it's meta power available him an it's not all power it's East power and then he's made it available to all that believe that we can come and receive of it Amen that will so we can do his works Amen but it Tim style if he could just come in this business tonight [Music] couldn't help but think this morning when brother Billy was preaching about Lazarus and how Jesus wept and that's the scripture it's a shortest verse in the Bible st. John 11:35 but how that was the basis of the claim this woman had what she came to brother Branham and said that brother Branham put too much on Jesus Christ that he wasn't divine and he said she said he could she could prove it to him he said how is that and took him to that scripture and said jesus wept he was a man and he said truly he was just a man [Music] but when he laid his shoulders back and called Lazarus forth from the grave he said that was more than a man that was scar and what brother David brought us tonight is that abstract power it comes down even we as mortals take up on a heavenly beam and we're we're more than men and when a man so let's bow our heads gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the many things Lord that you've done for us the examples you've sent before us and given the Lord is nothing like the Living Word or did we have access to and Lord you continue to to bring us to higher heights and deeper depths of revelation and understanding morning realizing that it's nothing that we've done that the calling of God in our lives Lord so Lord we pray that we can yield to the spirit Lord that it wants to move up a little higher and Lord may our flesh not hold it but Lord may we just continue to to soar in the heavenlies Lord spiritually speaking that the Lord we recognize the truth we see a man to it so let it be done and the manifestation comes forth so Lord we pray that we would be held back from any any inhibitions or thoughts of our own Lord is there's nothing in this flesh it's gonna do it anyway the Lord may we yield to your presence go with us this day Lord and thank you for the beautiful weather at the time we've had Lord and the comfort of the Holy Spirit or may we enjoy the blessings and the access to all the the power the abstract gives us or Lord what do we have need of in our lives we thank you for the testimonies the future testimonies truly Lord all that you're gonna do for us so keep us under the shelter of your wings we pray we actually Saints the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] god bless you I had a song in my mind I wanted just to win it seeing it as our dismissal him anything that song my my what a joy of serving Jesus Amen is a dismissal tonight amen we're gonna start with of course my my my water Troy you're serving my Jesus oh that I could explain the way I feel Rachel singing and speakable Troy and full of will free it's amazing but praise God I know it's real sing it again [Music] what a joy oh so my Jesus oh that I could explain the way of feeding ritual singing I'm speak about for control your glory it's amazing my praise God I know it's true when I receive salvation I feel such a relation when Jesus came and washed my Saints away gives the strength and power to face my midnight I work with all my heart and soul I now can stay why the joy will save me my cheese huh or that I could explain ritual singing mistakable joy and full of boring it's amazing Mockridge god I know it's cream cheese I seized my safe Hill he keeps me love and favor you my redeemer master building he here I'll tell the story and give him all the glory he brought me out and give me strong to speak my mind or that I could explain the we are free Rachel singing I speak of all joy and full of glory it's amazing my my my what a joy of serving hot cheetos well then I could explain the way I feel Rachael singing us makeable joy and full of its amazing you
