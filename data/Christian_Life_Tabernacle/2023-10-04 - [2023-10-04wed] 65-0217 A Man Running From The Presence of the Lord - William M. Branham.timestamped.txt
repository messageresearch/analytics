[23:52] that your great desire is to return us
[23:55] all back with you where we were at in
[23:59] the
[24:00] beginning father to have the preeminence
[24:03] to reveal yourself to us and to take us
[24:08] back to where we were with you in the
[24:10] beginning Lord we thank you for
[24:13] that having those
[24:16] feelings and being mindful of us is such
[24:19] a comfort and blessing to us we ask you
[24:22] to bless us this evening in Jesus
[24:25] precious name we pray amen
[24:28] amen amen God bless you tonight if you
[24:31] have your Bibles uh let us turn over to
[24:35] the Book of
[24:36] Jonah and um that's where uh our
[24:42] messenger is going to uh uh
[24:46] read um and
[24:49] uh uh so we're going to play a portion
[24:54] of that uh message this evening
[24:58] um and uh we'll be starting in uh
[25:02] paragraph 42 if you have some sort of uh
[25:07] a way to read it on your phone or of
[25:10] course it'll be on the board I trust and
[25:12] we're going to go all the way through
[25:14] paragraph 141 so we're going to go from
[25:18] uh paragraph 42 through 141 it's about
[25:22] 45 minutes tonight but it's a a a very
[25:26] tremendous message
[25:28] um uh to me it's very
[25:32] important of where brother Brandon
[25:35] placed his messages when he spoke them I
[25:38] think there is a meaning in every bit of
[25:40] it the timing of this is
[25:44] significant and
[25:46] uh uh and I think you'll be able to
[25:50] understand what he's saying uh the
[25:53] presence of the Lord was there and and I
[25:58] think everybody recognized the presence
[26:00] of the Lord was with brother Brandon I
[26:03] mean there was just something about him
[26:05] when he came the atmosphere he created
[26:09] the signs and wonders that followed him
[26:12] that they knew for Surly that the Lord
[26:16] was with him and yet they chose
[26:22] to go
[26:24] back
[26:26] to and run from that presence that was
[26:29] there with them to go back to what they
[26:31] felt more comfortable with they started
[26:34] going back to the the old ways they
[26:37] started following after kathern Coleman
[26:40] and other he Divine healers that were
[26:44] coming onto the scene uh other
[26:46] Ministries that didn't just quite stay
[26:49] with the word but we we do it because he
[26:53] makes a statement in here he says this
[26:56] is a very example of all of us so I I
[27:01] think if we after we listen to this uh
[27:04] it'll be a blessing and then when I get
[27:06] back from uh Cloverdale uh we'll go back
[27:10] into some of these things in a little
[27:12] more context so uh we're just going to
[27:15] pick up there and we're going to start
[27:18] and just listen for the next 45 minutes
[27:21] to the messenger of the hour and I
[27:23] believe you'll be truly blessed let's
[27:25] pray heavenly father as we listen to the
[27:27] voice that you left to guide us in this
[27:31] hour Lord you chose by Your Divine
[27:36] wisdom to create and have man find the
[27:41] magnetic tape so that the voice could be
[27:46] recorded Lord and we can sit here in
[27:49] this present hour and hear the voice of
[27:52] God lord and it we know that it'll bring
[27:56] life to us because spiritual food in due
[27:59] season may you speak to each believer's
[28:02] heart father may they find the
[28:05] truth and the food that you have for
[28:08] them this evening we ask you to bless us
[28:11] now in Jesus precious name we pray amen
[28:15] after the scripture reading feel free to
[28:17] take your seat uh thank you Brothers God
[28:20] bless
[28:26] you
[28:56] for
[29:13] you don't have
[29:17] it go ahead and have your seat just uh
[29:21] relax for a moment and
[29:25] uh soon as we get
[29:56] will
[30:26] for
[30:56] e
[31:26] for
[31:31] technology you know and maybe somebody
[31:34] has a testimony that they'd like to give
[31:37] about the goodness of the Lord has the
[31:40] Lord done anything for
[31:43] anybody oh you guys haven't been in
[31:46] prayer no God's always doing something
[31:49] good for somebody we just know that he's
[31:52] real and uh uh you know I in this little
[31:56] message
[31:57] the prophet of God makes a a a statement
[32:02] and uh uh I don't know if we'll be able
[32:06] to
[32:07] uh get the uh you know the tape up or
[32:12] not but uh I think I trust that maybe
[32:15] you'd go home and and uh listen to it
[32:21] but uh he he I mean we all know the the
[32:26] uh
[32:29] um story of Jonah that of course he was
[32:32] running because the Lord came to him and
[32:35] told him to go to a place he'd never
[32:37] been before so to go into an environment
[32:41] and a place and a a level of
[32:45] discomfort that he had never been in
[32:48] before so he was asking him to to go do
[32:52] something him being a Jew to go to the
[32:56] Gentiles and that was an uncomfortable
[32:59] place for him to go to and
[33:03] so it's it's man's human nature to stay
[33:08] within their comfort zone and even when
[33:11] our messenger begin to preach the gospel
[33:14] that he brought with signs and wonders
[33:18] the greatest challenge they had was that
[33:21] now here was somebody that uh they they
[33:24] were in the Pentecostal movement they uh
[33:27] they uh were uh believing in Divine he
[33:33] healing ready believing in Divine gifts
[33:36] they were believing in all these things
[33:39] and all of a sudden somebody came along
[33:41] that could do all those
[33:43] things even if I could say that more
[33:48] abundantly and with more power than
[33:51] they'd ever seen but yet he was teaching
[33:53] a different Doctrine and that brought
[33:56] him in into a place that they were out
[33:58] of their comfort zone and and and this
[34:02] is what with Nineveh and so they they
[34:05] were running from the presence of the
[34:07] Lord because it was a place that they
[34:10] weren't comfortable with they've never
[34:12] been there they've never felt this way
[34:14] they've never seen that but brother R
[34:16] makes this this statement to everybody
[34:19] he says sh this we must tell the people
[34:25] that we are living in the hour of the
[34:29] hours of the coming of the Son of God we
[34:34] want to watch and God be on the move all
[34:39] the time ready to give a man a correct
[34:45] answer you know so you talk about
[34:48] sometimes the things that we we uh we
[34:50] walk away from or we Sher our
[34:53] responsibility because of it takes us
[34:56] out of our our comfort zone so listen to
[34:58] as our messenger breaks the word to us
[35:00] tonight God bless you ready brother
[35:04] Caleb see if we can get it going many of
[35:06] you in your Bibles I want you to turn to
[35:08] the Book of
[35:10] Jonah always talk so much about Jon
[35:13] being a backlit and everything i' always
[35:16] up for I do not believe Jonah was
[35:20] backlit I I do not believe that I
[35:23] believe it's just we just sometimes use
[35:26] it he's a Jonah but if we I've already
[35:30] spoke on it in another way and telling
[35:32] how that I thought
[35:34] Jonah
[35:36] place now the word of the Lord came to
[35:40] Jonah the son of amida saying arise and
[35:45] go to n that great city cry out against
[35:49] it or their wickedness has come up
[35:52] before me but Jonah rose up to flee un t
[35:56] from the presence of the Lord and went
[35:59] down to japa and he found a ship going
[36:02] to Tara so he paid the fair thereof and
[36:06] went down into it to go with them unto
[36:10] tarus from the presence of the
[36:14] Lord isn't that a sad ending a man
[36:19] running from the presence of the Lord
[36:22] that's my subject now first we want to
[36:26] think of this
[36:27] Jonah was the reason the principal
[36:31] reason that I believe that he did this
[36:33] great thing here was because Jonah was a
[36:37] Jew and he was asked to go to a gentile
[36:41] City to cry out against it thinking that
[36:44] he would not be received because the
[36:47] Gentiles would think what's this Jew got
[36:49] to do with us but you see another thing
[36:52] it gives us a great thing here to see
[36:55] that God not only is is God of the Jew
[36:58] but he's God also of the Gentile he's
[37:01] God of all people he just chose the
[37:05] Jews the Jews was called God's chosen
[37:09] people they were chosen for a Pacific
[37:13] cause and that cause was to give to them
[37:16] the law and they could not keep it and
[37:20] he just showed by that people that the
[37:22] law could not be kept and that he was a
[37:26] uh
[37:27] a god of righteousness and the law
[37:29] demanded righteousness but there was no
[37:32] Grace in law to bring a man out no
[37:34] penalty was paid by the law but it taken
[37:38] Grace to pay that penalty of where the
[37:40] law put us under and Jonah here was
[37:44] called on as this one of the Minor
[37:47] Prophets of the Bible to go down to this
[37:50] city and here we find an example of all
[37:54] of us every one of us we always are
[37:57] running from something we run from
[38:00] trouble we run from
[38:03] responsibilities we we're all prone to
[38:05] do that we we are we're more prone to
[38:08] run and we are to stand and face it out
[38:11] see we just we we find ourselves running
[38:14] sometimes we find ourselves prone to run
[38:16] from work we don't want to we don't want
[38:18] to work some people just thinks they can
[38:21] make their living without working but I
[38:23] think Solomon it was that said we could
[38:26] find uh here the answer I'm watching an
[38:28] anunt you know a little Aunt they tell
[38:31] me if that ever ant doesn't work and lay
[38:33] in that Aunt doesn't eat that winter
[38:35] either so everybody has to to work we
[38:39] got so many things we have to do so much
[38:42] responsibility that we have to face
[38:45] everybody's got to face a certain
[38:47] responsibility when you when you come to
[38:51] to choose your wife to get married or
[38:54] choose your husband you you've got to
[38:56] take a
[38:58] responsibility and then you must
[39:00] remember maybe you build a home it's a
[39:02] nice pretty home and then remember as a
[39:05] married woman you got to think of the
[39:08] responsibility of raising children you
[39:11] got to think of that pretty slick walls
[39:13] you going to have little dirty
[39:15] handprints all over them then you got
[39:17] the responsibility educating your
[39:19] children you got the responsibility
[39:20] clothing and feeding everything is a
[39:23] responsibility and it's so easy when
[39:25] responsibility is faces to sh from them
[39:29] and we find out that marriage is a
[39:32] responsibility in all manners even many
[39:35] times we find this is hard to say but
[39:37] it's true that ministers many times sh a
[39:42] responsibility or standing for the true
[39:46] word of God when they're confronted with
[39:48] it they'll sh that
[39:51] responsibility when truth of the word of
[39:55] God is brought face to face face with we
[39:57] human beings we have we're prone to Shir
[40:01] back until the last
[40:03] resource I just got through talking to
[40:06] my little nephew up there he's a
[40:08] Catholic and he u i baptized that boy in
[40:11] the name of Jesus Christ here a few
[40:13] years ago and he got with some little
[40:15] girl and turned Catholic and I held his
[40:17] mother's hand while she was dying over
[40:19] there she said to me the last words take
[40:21] care of Melvin and he's just been
[40:23] Dreaming Dreams he just came every every
[40:25] day the last week been dreaming dream
[40:27] said i' walk into your church Uncle Bill
[40:29] you stand there preaching I'd run up to
[40:30] start a make a confession I'd wake up he
[40:33] said I I've been wrong I said Melvin you
[40:35] don't need no interpretation for that
[40:38] your place is down there where you
[40:40] belong that's right but to face up to
[40:45] responsibilities sometimes it takes a
[40:47] very hide off of us to do that as a
[40:49] father to face up the responsibility to
[40:52] give your child a whiping them little
[40:54] fellas you don't want to do that but as
[40:56] a father a mother you got the face of
[40:58] responsibility of raising that child
[41:00] because the Bible said spare the rod you
[41:03] spoil your son and that still stands
[41:05] good in the S of every psychologist
[41:08] there is in the world that Still Remains
[41:09] God's truth if it had been more of that
[41:12] practice we wouldn't have had much
[41:14] juvenile delinquency and stuff in the
[41:16] rot we got in the world today but the
[41:18] old Golden Rule of the homes been broken
[41:20] a long time ago and they that the kids
[41:22] do whatever they want to but even as I
[41:24] said ministers
[41:27] they'll come face to face with truth and
[41:29] then walk away from it see they they're
[41:31] just have it seems like there's
[41:33] something that they they don't want to
[41:35] face up to it many times I've had people
[41:38] come say I know that's right brother
[41:39] Brandon but if I did that they kick me
[41:41] out of the church what of
[41:43] it if you don't you're going to kick you
[41:46] out up there so you got to be kicked out
[41:48] somewhere see so you might as well face
[41:51] up to it instead of running from it say
[41:53] well I'll go over here I won't go back
[41:55] go back sure listen to some more of it
[41:58] search the scriptures Jesus said search
[42:00] the scriptures for in them you think you
[42:02] have eternal life and they are they that
[42:04] testify of me but we find that people
[42:08] won't face up with that being brought to
[42:10] U into the presence of God and see when
[42:14] God made a promise and God is obligated
[42:17] to that promise and when he brings that
[42:19] promise to pass then people are afraid
[42:23] to face up to the responsibility of
[42:26] hoping with the message of the hour we
[42:29] find that everywhere how about you
[42:31] Lutheran how many Lutheran was afraid to
[42:34] uh people was afraid to face up to
[42:36] Luther's truth when he come forth with
[42:38] justification look what it cost you
[42:41] maybe your own life to come out and
[42:43] confess Jesus Christ and and become a a
[42:46] Lutheran look at you methodists how it
[42:48] used to be you all were called Holy
[42:50] Rollers I guess you know that and they
[42:52] get out the spirit and jerk back and
[42:54] forth and they said they they had the
[42:55] jerks the meth that no that ain't
[42:57] Pentecostal that was Methodist long
[43:00] years ago and they jerked and Shook and
[43:02] fell under the power of God and they
[43:04] throw water in their faces and faned
[43:06] with fans thought they passed out and
[43:09] now you were considered a bunch of holy
[43:11] rollers but you had your mothers and
[43:13] fathers had to either accept it face up
[43:16] to the truth and facts or turn it or
[43:18] down what about you Pentecostal that
[43:20] receive the restoration of the gifts
[43:22] when the baptism the Holy Ghost come out
[43:24] with speaking in tongues and the gifts
[43:26] of the Spirit coming back in the church
[43:29] well the methodists want to kick you out
[43:30] and they did do it but you had to face
[43:33] up to it it's something you had to do
[43:36] what about the issue when it come out
[43:37] about the baptism in the name of Jesus
[43:39] Christ and you saw it was the truth you
[43:41] had to face up to it or do something
[43:44] about it you've got a
[43:46] responsibility everybody has and you
[43:49] must face up to these things all right
[43:52] and when you see that in this day now
[43:54] when the word of God has made these
[43:55] promise Promises of things that we see
[43:57] happening now then we've got the
[43:59] responsibility to either face up to it
[44:02] or get away from it you have you just
[44:04] can't stay neutral you've got to do
[44:07] something about it say some moves got to
[44:10] be made you can't come in that church
[44:12] door and go out the same person you come
[44:14] in you're either further away or closer
[44:17] to God every time you come in or go out
[44:20] there oh how easy it is for people to
[44:23] Sher these things now I want us to think
[44:26] of these when we start into the official
[44:29] uh Services tomorrow night that I want
[44:32] you to notice when something is
[44:34] confronted if you if there's a question
[44:36] about it if there's a question about it
[44:38] there's got to be an answer say for
[44:40] instance I said I was going west and you
[44:43] pointed me this way well the first thing
[44:45] you know I run Plum past my Target and
[44:47] I'm too I'm Northwest well while
[44:49] somebody points me down this way and I
[44:51] go that way I'll pass my target again I
[44:53] went Southwest well as long as there's a
[44:56] question which way is west there's got
[44:57] to be a direct answer somewhere and when
[45:00] these questions confront us about the
[45:02] Bible truth there's got to be the right
[45:05] answer
[45:06] somewhere right it's got to be there and
[45:08] when we see something presented I think
[45:11] instead of just run away say oh nonsense
[45:13] I couldn't believe a thing like that I
[45:15] couldn't believe that why don't you take
[45:17] the Bible and sit down and face up to it
[45:20] study it you're here in the meeting now
[45:22] just look it over check it out yourself
[45:25] with the word check the word by the word
[45:27] that's the only way to make it tell the
[45:29] truth and it must tell the truth from
[45:31] Genesis or
[45:33] Revelations Christ is the revelation of
[45:35] the whole Bible in him Christ all the
[45:38] full fulfilling of all the Prophecies of
[45:40] the Bible is met unconditionally in
[45:43] Christ Jesus because he was God
[45:46] manifested In the Flesh now when we find
[45:49] these things old when we're confronted
[45:51] and come into a meeting and see the
[45:53] power of God moving and doing things and
[45:56] doing Supernatural works and sit
[45:58] performed and look in the Bible and see
[46:00] that it's promised for this hour then
[46:03] when we see those things then we are
[46:05] confronted with the responsibility to
[46:07] either accept it I mean as for ourselves
[46:11] now many people sympathize many people
[46:13] say it's right but that don't that don't
[46:16] make it what that ain't the thing that
[46:18] you're responsible for is I've said what
[46:21] if I was a young man and looking for a
[46:24] wife to be married and here stood a girl
[46:26] that met every qualification that I
[46:28] thought it tough to make a woman while
[46:30] morally she was a queen and lovely and a
[46:34] a a fine personality a real Christian
[46:36] everything that I could think of to make
[46:38] me a good wife no matter how much I say
[46:40] she's perfect she's exactly right she
[46:43] isn't mine till I accept her and the
[46:47] responsibility of her being my wife
[46:50] that's the same thing the message is you
[46:51] might say it's right or this that there
[46:53] and say I sympathize with it I believe
[46:55] it's the truth but you've got to accept
[46:57] it and it's got to become a part of you
[46:59] and you a part of it you got then it's
[47:03] yours when you marry this certain woman
[47:06] that you have chosen you are you are one
[47:09] man and that's where you are with Christ
[47:11] when you see manifested and made real
[47:14] then you are part of him and he's part
[47:16] of you and together you're part of the
[47:20] message oh how many denominational ships
[47:23] have we got going down to tares for the
[47:25] Jonas of these
[47:27] days 900 of them something a ships that
[47:31] takes the easy
[47:32] route don't want to face up to it Jonah
[47:35] didn't want to face up the thing of
[47:36] going to the Gentiles he didn't want to
[47:39] take that cruel message over there
[47:41] within 40 days you'll perish if you
[47:43] don't repent he hated to do that he
[47:46] thought them Gentiles was hard tell what
[47:48] they'll do to me but he had to face up
[47:50] to it he but he took a easy ship and
[47:53] went down to Tara went down down in a h
[47:56] of the ship and went to sleep took the
[48:00] easy route the easy way it's a poer way
[48:03] with the people it's easy to take the
[48:05] way where everybody can patch you on the
[48:07] back and say you're a good fell and this
[48:09] is so and so and certain and the world
[48:11] look up on you it's easy to go the poer
[48:14] way but when when you have to do
[48:17] something different when you have to
[48:19] stand to your conviction and what you
[48:22] know to be the truth there's where the
[48:24] hard part that's the rub comes right
[48:27] there oh as we've often sang that old
[48:29] song how easy while sailing the sea and
[48:31] is calm to trust in the strength of
[48:33] Jehovah's great arm but oh let the waves
[48:36] begin to blow let let the wind blow and
[48:39] whip up the waves then what do you do
[48:42] something like I told one time that a
[48:44] lady said back in a horse and buggy days
[48:46] that said the horse run away with her
[48:48] going from church said what' you do said
[48:50] I trusted the Lord until the lines broke
[48:53] well that's the time to trust the Lord
[48:55] after Ever After the lines is broke
[48:57] you're trusting in the lines until
[48:59] they're
[49:00] broke yes and um so we find out that we
[49:04] have many easy ways to go ships going
[49:07] down to Tara far it's easy unresponsible
[49:11] polities it just Flows in You have
[49:14] everything coming to everybody's likes
[49:16] you and everybody nobody disagree with
[49:18] you you disagree with nobody now that
[49:20] ain't a dish
[49:23] rag that's right yes push over flop over
[49:28] why anybody I don't care who you are and
[49:32] what you're standing for actually decent
[49:35] thinking people will think more of you
[49:36] if you'll stand for your conviction of
[49:38] what's right right don't care you take a
[49:41] woman she might be ever not very
[49:43] attractive and whatever she is but you
[49:45] let that woman stand for principles of
[49:48] Womanhood let her stand like a lady and
[49:51] if a man's got an ounce of man about him
[49:53] he'll take up for Absolut we appreciate
[49:56] something that that somebody's got that
[49:58] they believe that is the truth and'll
[49:59] stand for what they think it's right how
[50:02] Wishy was you that's what too many
[50:05] Christians today are so sof soaked and
[50:07] everything until they think all they do
[50:09] is join a church go in somewhere put
[50:10] their name on a book or do a little
[50:12] something jump up and down shout or
[50:14] something like that and call it
[50:16] Christianity Christianity is a everyday
[50:19] rugged life living for God in the
[50:21] presence world it's a constant burning
[50:24] of the fire and love of God in the heart
[50:27] that set you a fire and put you out you
[50:29] under with the people and making
[50:30] converts to Christ responsibilities but
[50:34] it's easy to go the way the world goes
[50:36] it's easy to flow down the stream go out
[50:38] there and sit down in the river with
[50:40] your boat you get your ores and start
[50:41] pulling up against the current you don't
[50:43] make much time and it goes hard but you
[50:46] just once let loose the ORS and watch
[50:48] how fast you pass the trees going down
[50:50] but look where you're
[50:52] going when things are floating easy
[50:54] remember your you're going towards a a
[50:56] great cataract down there of some sort
[50:58] you're going towards the falls it won't
[51:00] be long you'll be going over that falls
[51:03] just floating with the world easy the
[51:05] way it goes you don't want that no sir
[51:08] but you must re accept your
[51:10] responsibility now you believe it and
[51:12] you you think it's a truth and the
[51:15] responsibility that God has given us in
[51:17] this day to bring this message and as I
[51:21] get older and I know my days are
[51:23] shortening up I feel a respons
[51:25] responsibility greater than I ever felt
[51:28] press it
[51:30] on we must do it we must get down to it
[51:34] in everywhere we go and tell the message
[51:38] and and tell the people that Jesus
[51:40] Christ is coming that he's God and he's
[51:42] coming soon there's not a not a hope
[51:44] left in the world but the coming of the
[51:47] Lord looking back there are some friends
[51:50] that's with me up there when the angel
[51:51] of the Lord these boys sitting here I
[51:53] believe they found the place where it
[51:54] happened up there and you just remember
[51:56] what the Lord said that day to brother
[51:58] Woods was walking up the hill and and he
[52:01] was kind of weeping because of his wife
[52:03] being sick and the Lord said pick up
[52:05] that rock and throw it up in the air and
[52:07] say thus sayith the Lord and I did that
[52:09] brother Woods is setting as a witness
[52:11] and I said brother Woods it won't be
[52:12] long you're going to see something
[52:14] happen the next day when we were
[52:16] standing there all of us together and a
[52:18] bunch of the man standing right here
[52:20] tonight A young preacher was there and
[52:23] he was uh I noticed I just him the night
[52:25] before he was in our camp he'd come up
[52:27] to be with us and he said to me he said
[52:29] brother Brandon do you ever see Visions
[52:31] out like this I said yes sir but I come
[52:34] out here to get away from him to kind of
[52:35] rest a little bit he said well I said uh
[52:38] uh of course he shows me things out here
[52:42] and I said just over the hill here where
[52:44] the seven angels appeared down in there
[52:46] he said yeah I understand said I was one
[52:48] of the sponsors on your meeting over in
[52:50] California I said well I'm certainly
[52:51] glad to know that and while I was
[52:53] standing there just then I looked around
[52:55] around I seen a kind of a heavy set
[52:57] doctor looking into his eyes and I heard
[52:58] him say you're going to lose that eye
[53:00] because his allergy in there and I've
[53:02] doctored but two years and you're going
[53:04] to lose that eye I said the reason you
[53:06] asked me that because your doctor told
[53:07] you other day he's going to lose that
[53:09] eye and he said that's right and he
[53:12] looked around like that I seen his
[53:14] mother take off one of her stockings and
[53:16] hold her foot out with little tumors
[53:18] hanging down between her toes up and
[53:20] down her Lake and said if you see
[53:22] brother brand tell him to pray for this
[53:24] I said your mother hand her stuck her
[53:27] foot out like that and said she had she
[53:29] got little tumors all over her toes and
[53:31] like that and said to have brother
[53:33] Brandon pray he said brother Brandon
[53:35] that's the truth I look back when I did
[53:37] I see him standing there looking at me
[53:39] like that with his eyes this is bright I
[53:41] made him this fall he had better eyes
[53:42] than anybody in the camp the Lord had
[53:44] heal him and made him
[53:46] well while I was standing there the Lord
[53:48] said show me what was going to happen
[53:50] judgments fixing to strike the west
[53:52] coast and he said get over there beside
[53:54] that fireplace I had had a shovel in my

[54:52] been the Thunders and pushings and uh
[54:55] everything happening one of these days
[54:57] she's going to slide beneath the ocean
[55:00] right what is it we're living in the
[55:03] hour of the coming of the lord we see
[55:06] isms and things rising up and all these
[55:08] different things we know there's got to
[55:10] be a true answer to this there's people
[55:12] out there in the country now going into
[55:14] caves and things on the 16th of March
[55:16] you read the paper the Lord's coming you
[55:18] know that isn't so Jesus said no man
[55:20] knows near they are when we see all
[55:22] these things and things taking place the
[55:23] way they are they got to be a true
[55:25] answer somewhere there's got to be a
[55:28] truth there's one East and one West but
[55:30] there's a one Southeast and Northwest or
[55:33] something but there's got to be a true
[55:34] answer somewhere to the problem sh this
[55:38] we must tell the people that we're
[55:40] living in the hours of the coming of the
[55:42] Son of God we want want to watch and God
[55:45] be on the move all the time ready to
[55:49] give a man a correct answer it's always
[55:52] been that way it's been man as shered
[55:54] and went away from God ever since Adam
[55:57] in the Garden of Eden when Adam was in
[55:59] the Garden of Eden when he come to the
[56:00] responsibility to make his choice would
[56:03] he stay with God or go with his wife he
[56:06] had to make that he had to make that the
[56:08] responsibility was up to him either had
[56:11] to take what his wife said or what God
[56:13] Said and when he chose to go the way of
[56:16] his wife and when he did that then he
[56:19] lost his original condition and brought
[56:22] the whole world subject to death when he
[56:25] had to take the responsibility of
[56:27] accepting a new life that his wife had
[56:29] found which was
[56:31] contrary oh God think of it God only
[56:35] give him about eight or 10 words to
[56:38] keep but that that tree thou shall not
[56:42] eat that's all they had to keep and even
[56:44] just that much word they broke it then
[56:48] Adam had to face up will I will I do as
[56:50] my wife has said do or shall I do what
[56:53] God Said do and he walked out with his
[56:55] eyes
[56:57] open he had to take the responsibility
[56:59] that throw the whole human race unto
[57:02] death then there come that other Adam
[57:04] which was
[57:05] Christ never one like him somebody say
[57:09] he wasn't God his uniqueness proved he
[57:12] was God I never was a creature live like
[57:15] him he lived in a world to himself he
[57:18] was born outside of the rim of the
[57:21] natural Hallelujah it was the creator
[57:23] himself
[57:27] who could ever stand where he stood who
[57:29] could ever talk like him who could ever
[57:30] say the things that he said who could
[57:32] ever do the things that he done his
[57:35] uniqueness proved he was God he wasn't a
[57:37] prophet or nothing else could do what he
[57:39] done you could call the dead back from
[57:42] the grave and who could stop the skies
[57:44] and do anything he wanted to do he was
[57:47] God who could ever stand in this place
[57:50] who what could he be with that perfect
[57:53] Immortal God a made flesh into
[57:57] all nothing ever compared with him he
[57:59] lived in a world to himself no man ever
[58:02] spake like him when he just opened his
[58:04] mouth there was something about it that
[58:07] was different from anybody
[58:09] else somebody said he was just an
[58:11] ordinary man I defy
[58:14] that God what he was or no man ever
[58:18] spoke like him old man could speak like
[58:20] him because he was a living word itself
[58:23] made flesh
[58:25] the manifestation of the fullness of God
[58:28] I will admit them prophets had their
[58:29] message ah Hadad them then ahead of them
[58:31] now but that was a pness of the godhead
[58:33] poly manifested
[58:37] there he was the unique one and he was
[58:40] the one that had to face the issue with
[58:42] all of his great powers that he had that
[58:45] he could have absolutely been the king
[58:47] of the world he will be and he to the
[58:50] Saints he is now amen he stood there
[58:54] what name of would be poor didn't have a
[58:55] place to lay his head that even though
[58:57] it were a fish water a
[59:00] coin who what man could take them big
[59:03] jugs of water and turn them into wine
[59:04] and not have a place to lay his head he
[59:07] had to face up to the responsibilities
[59:10] that have been given into his hand what
[59:11] man that could Raise A Man Out of the
[59:13] Grave age had been dead four days and
[59:16] rotten could he not have saved himself
[59:18] sure he could but if he did he had not
[59:20] saved us he had to face up to the
[59:23] responsibilities and because of his
[59:25] obedience to the word for Adam's
[59:28] Disobedience and he took the shortcut
[59:30] the the way down to Tous but Jesus Took
[59:34] the Le and in to the Gentiles to get
[59:36] himself a bride I'm glad that he did it
[59:41] tonight we are to face up to the facts
[59:43] that we belong to
[59:45] him take the world away amen every man
[59:49] had to face up to that's got a
[59:51] responsibility before God we just take
[59:53] for instance Noah he had Noah Moses
[59:56] Elijah and all the rest of them of every
[1:00:00] age had to face up to the responsibility
[1:00:03] and they had to do it but that's the
[1:00:05] reason they were sent in the hour look
[1:00:07] at Noah in his scientific age how he had
[1:00:10] to face up to a thing that was so
[1:00:12] unscientific why there wasn't a a reason
[1:00:15] why it couldn't be unscientific the it
[1:00:18] it was unscientific rather why they said
[1:00:20] it's going to rain out of the Skies they
[1:00:22] never had rain to drop out of the
[1:00:23] heavens
[1:00:25] now he had to face up to it God said it
[1:00:26] was going to rain and then he then faith
[1:00:29] without works is dead if you say I
[1:00:32] believe it don't make no act it's like
[1:00:35] the message you say I believe it don't
[1:00:37] make an act what good does it
[1:00:38] do Noah went to work with his hammer and
[1:00:41] build an art to confirm what he was
[1:00:43] talking about that's what we have to do
[1:00:45] too we have to go to work and prove our
[1:00:48] faith by our works our works proves our
[1:00:50] faith Moses had to do it Elijah had to
[1:00:52] do it every prophet in his age had to
[1:00:54] stand up and face these responsibilities
[1:00:57] but many of them didn't do like Jonah he
[1:00:59] run they didn't notice cry out against
[1:01:04] it oh my there it is that's the subject
[1:01:08] cry out against it there's the check
[1:01:11] part this going tell those Fells say I
[1:01:13] come down to join up with you guys you
[1:01:15] know I believe I tell you what I do I've
[1:01:17] got just a little thing here I believe I
[1:01:19] can make it a bring us all together and
[1:01:21] do this that the other but it was cry
[1:01:23] out against
[1:01:25] when you had to cry out against
[1:01:27] something now he had to cry out against
[1:01:29] everything that was down there cry out
[1:01:31] against the city CED against their work
[1:01:33] cried against their Church cried against
[1:01:35] their prophets cried against their
[1:01:37] ministers cried against their priests
[1:01:39] cry against it the whole
[1:01:41] thing cry out against
[1:01:43] it Noah cried out against his agid sure
[1:01:47] he did against the churches of his age
[1:01:49] Moses must certainly did cry out against
[1:01:52] his his age of the people the priest and
[1:01:54] so forth he cried all the way through
[1:01:56] the Wilderness never Junction he cried
[1:01:59] continually crying to the people Elijah
[1:02:01] was very unpopular in his day because he
[1:02:05] cried out against that age certainly was
[1:02:09] John the Baptist is very unpopular in
[1:02:11] his age he cried out against his age he
[1:02:13] said to the king the the potentate of
[1:02:17] the of the land he he had married his
[1:02:19] brother's wife he had to preach on
[1:02:21] marriage and divorce one morning so he
[1:02:23] cried inst it that it's not lawful for
[1:02:26] you to have her it cost him his head to
[1:02:29] be cut off later but he cried out and he
[1:02:32] stood to his post of Duty he never took
[1:02:34] a ship to tarus and said well I'll agree
[1:02:37] with you herry it's all right as long as
[1:02:38] you think she's a nice woman she's
[1:02:40] making a nice wife go ahead firsty them
[1:02:42] FH eggs yeah just every little
[1:02:46] thing well it's nothing to clean dirty
[1:02:49] plates with but notice John wasn't that
[1:02:52] way he faced right up to it he say is
[1:02:55] not lawful for you to have her yes and
[1:02:58] he stood out against
[1:02:59] it they never run John didn't they stood
[1:03:02] in face the facts Moses tried to run one
[1:03:05] time like Jonah but God brought him back
[1:03:07] many of them tried to get away from it
[1:03:09] they start but look if God has called
[1:03:11] you and you're are sure that God's in
[1:03:13] the message there's nothing going to
[1:03:15] turn you back it didn't turn Jonah no
[1:03:19] sir Amos of old Cried Out said the lion
[1:03:22] is roared who came can but fear and God
[1:03:26] has spake who can but
[1:03:28] prophesy who can but prophesy when you
[1:03:31] see God speaks and said a certain thing
[1:03:33] will happen and there it
[1:03:35] is lion roar is everybody scared yes sir
[1:03:38] have you ever heard one Roar in a jungle
[1:03:40] you hear these Ming around these cages
[1:03:42] out hear them tame lines but you already
[1:03:44] hear a real W and Roar one time little
[1:03:46] rocks will fall off the hill 500 yards
[1:03:49] away I want see where all that belch
[1:03:51] comes out of them lungs and he throws
[1:03:52] his head down throws that fur up I never
[1:03:54] heard any like a a cannon going off when
[1:03:57] he belches out that big Roar in his
[1:03:59] lungs who couldn't be scared to say if
[1:04:01] you ever killed by line is painless he
[1:04:03] scares you to death before he gets to
[1:04:05] you you don't notice it he scares you
[1:04:08] with that great fous Roar and here he is

[1:04:12] roared who can but fear and God has
[1:04:16] spoke who can but prophesy when you see
[1:04:20] God doing something you say I might not
[1:04:21] be a prophet J said I might not be a
[1:04:23] prophet of the son of a prophet but God
[1:04:26] has spoke who can but prophesy I might
[1:04:29] not be a prophet I might not be this out
[1:04:30] there when I see God doing anything and
[1:04:32] I see you're in a word and he promised
[1:04:33] it who can't hold her peace and keep
[1:04:35] still sir he's done it neither can we
[1:04:39] hide behind Creeds and all these your
[1:04:41] fellowships and down to to tarus we
[1:04:44] don't want to go there fellowships but
[1:04:46] may like Adam do the same thing try to
[1:04:49] make a substitute in some way try to
[1:04:50] find a way out and and make a substitute
[1:04:53] to face God knowing the wrong faced up
[1:04:55] to the truth went on with his wife and
[1:04:57] did exactly what God told him not to do
[1:04:59] he went right ahead and did it anyhow
[1:05:01] then he found himself naked she and he
[1:05:04] both in the Garden of Eden their eyes
[1:05:06] come open they know what was right and
[1:05:07] wrong man and then he tried to find a
[1:05:10] substitute to kind of cover himself up
[1:05:11] with it now that's just about the way we
[1:05:13] do today an excuse that well I'll tell
[1:05:15] you if it was here if this or if if if
[1:05:18] that's just see but you must face up to
[1:05:20] it it's either right or wrong if it's
[1:05:23] right let's stay
[1:05:24] if it's wrong get away from it that's
[1:05:26] all get what find out what is right you
[1:05:28] don't want to wait any longer let's find
[1:05:29] out now what's truth and what's right
[1:05:31] and stay with it we know that's truth
[1:05:35] now we find today that our people are so
[1:05:38] it seems like all the sincerity has gone
[1:05:40] out of the churches uh and we are living
[1:05:44] in a house there of a pre precious
[1:05:46] sister that comes to this church she's
[1:05:47] probably sitting here tonight and she
[1:05:49] rins it out to her the people and she's
[1:05:51] just been so sweet to us about that
[1:05:53] place place about letting us have that
[1:05:55] place and so I'd call her name but she
[1:05:58] might not want me to do it she's been so
[1:06:00] sweet to us well we certainly wouldn't
[1:06:02] wouldn't want to expose her but she's
[1:06:03] been a very very dear woman and in the
[1:06:06] house there was a television over one
[1:06:08] side we got a little two duplex I got a
[1:06:11] big F and a bunch of young ons and we
[1:06:14] and you you know and they have to have
[1:06:15] beds and plenty of them and everything
[1:06:17] piled up on top you have to walk through
[1:06:18] this and through that to get in and out
[1:06:20] and then over there they had a
[1:06:22] television and in this uh a television
[1:06:25] these kids got watching on Sunday
[1:06:27] morning U some kind of a hymn singing
[1:06:30] that come on and you know it it would
[1:06:34] almost make you ashamed if there wasn't
[1:06:35] a genuine Christianity somewhere that
[1:06:37] you could put your hands on to see
[1:06:39] what's called
[1:06:40] Christianity why it seems like all the
[1:06:42] sincerity has gone out of it why they
[1:06:45] don't they don't seem to
[1:06:47] why it's just terrible way you stand
[1:06:49] there and draw their fist and fight one
[1:06:51] another on there and try to sing hymns
[1:06:53] and everything like that and pull jokes
[1:06:55] that hardly would a sailor would pull
[1:06:58] and say all kinds of things to kid and
[1:07:00] go on you know the
[1:07:02] sacredness of of of Christianity has
[1:07:05] seem to lose its place now I go to
[1:07:09] church and and see the pastor get up
[1:07:12] there and announce that the there's
[1:07:14] going to be a swimming bee all the women
[1:07:16] these bathing suits they're all going
[1:07:18] out there they're going to have a
[1:07:19] contest these women swimming and they're
[1:07:21] going to have a a party of some s you go
[1:07:24] to fry up a lot of chicken and play
[1:07:27] Bunko and and all these things like that
[1:07:30] to me that takes the genuine sincerity
[1:07:33] out of
[1:07:35] Christianity just get by with anything
[1:07:38] uh seen uh coming up here we find out
[1:07:44] you know we find more of our sisters
[1:07:46] wearing shorts up here in this cold
[1:07:48] country then you find him out there in a
[1:07:50] hot
[1:07:50] country it's true out there where it's
[1:07:53] really hot
[1:07:54] there not too many of them that wear
[1:07:56] them but here where where it's coold
[1:07:59] they they do it see it's they don't
[1:08:00] realize it's a devil doing that see now
[1:08:03] if it's to be comfortable if it's to
[1:08:04] help yourself it'd be different being
[1:08:07] man I think it looks sickly on a man but
[1:08:10] it but you wouldn't pay no attention to
[1:08:14] a man but the lady her body is sacred
[1:08:18] and she must keep it that way and to see
[1:08:21] all you can see people today these two
[1:08:23] spirits and one of them is a Holy Spirit
[1:08:26] the other is an Unholy spirit and one's
[1:08:28] governed by and both of them
[1:08:31] religious that's a strange part they're
[1:08:33] both religious and just like Esau and
[1:08:36] Jacob was both religious like Cain and
[1:08:39] Abel was both religious like Judas and
[1:08:42] Jesus was both religious both religious
[1:08:45] and we see it today both sides religious
[1:08:49] see it's the same Spirit the people die
[1:08:51] but the spirit doesn't die it's goes
[1:08:54] right on both religious one of them is
[1:08:56] possessed with the holy spirit that
[1:08:58] lives the kind of life that they should
[1:09:00] live and walk Godly and honest they
[1:09:03] wouldn't beat you out of a penny and
[1:09:04] they they do everything honest that they
[1:09:06] could to help you and others will just
[1:09:08] as nice as they can be and the others we
[1:09:11] find out it's just vice versa and yet
[1:09:13] both of them are religious Spirits two
[1:09:15] of them one Holy Spirit and the other
[1:09:19] Unholy spirit and if you notice it'll
[1:09:22] even though claiming religion they'll
[1:09:24] make fun of you and call you a holy
[1:09:25] ruler they do anything they can uh they
[1:09:28] ignoring the the unchanging word of God
[1:09:32] as though it never had been written see
[1:09:35] you can say now look at here if if the
[1:09:38] baptism I have the Holy Spirit and stand
[1:09:41] there that cigar in your hands yes I
[1:09:43] have the Holy Spirit I don't think it's
[1:09:45] wrong to take a little drink I don't
[1:09:47] think it see as you notice I don't think
[1:09:49] but God thinks different you see Accord
[1:09:51] to his word see they and they they just
[1:09:54] simply as much as as spit on it that's
[1:09:57] exactly right just as much as this
[1:09:59] little little guy that crawled
[1:10:01] out that time when David was being uh
[1:10:04] excommunicated from his throne he's
[1:10:06] going up on the Mount of ol he's going
[1:10:08] out weeping as he went up looking back
[1:10:10] and this little old fellow crawled out
[1:10:12] there and spitting on him and that guard
[1:10:13] said I'll let the that dog's head stay
[1:10:16] on him spit on my King David said let
[1:10:17] him alone see they spit on him about 800
[1:10:21] years later they spit on his son Jesus
[1:10:23] Jus Christ too and today they spit on it
[1:10:27] again as if it wasn't even just un
[1:10:30] reverent unconcerned just turn up their
[1:10:33] head and walk away from it laugh in your
[1:10:35] face why is it they only ship the tarus
[1:10:37] that's that it's called to God you got
[1:10:40] to cry out against evil cry out against
[1:10:42] sin cry against the things that's wrong
[1:10:45] now remember it'll
[1:10:48] be hey you know this time you know I'm
[1:10:51] two hours difference in two song just 10
[1:10:54] minutes after
[1:10:56] seven I'm getting kind of kind of out of
[1:10:59] my pleasure huh all right now remember
[1:11:02] we're going to have to answer F remember
[1:11:04] those who spit on Christ answer F when
[1:11:06] David returned back from his Exile when
[1:11:09] he was the Fugitive and when he returned
[1:11:11] back remember this fellow fell on his
[1:11:13] face and cried out for Mercy he spit on
[1:11:15] David going out but he was almost ready
[1:11:17] to bathe his feet with tears and when he
[1:11:21] returned back and someday those who
[1:11:23] Pierce Jesus will see it and those who
[1:11:25] are piercing him today will see it also
[1:11:28] there someday it'll come back remember
[1:11:30] Revelations 22 he requires us to keep
[1:11:32] every word that he has written every
[1:11:35] word now we know his presence are here
[1:11:38] it's Vindicated we are having it we're
[1:11:40] trusting in this coming week that'll
[1:11:42] continue to be uh uh Vindicated Among Us
[1:11:44] the sick will be healed and great things
[1:11:46] will be taking place we don't want the
[1:11:49] popper idea we want the truth now we
[1:11:51] don't we want don't want the we you
[1:11:53] don't want to face up to nothing but
[1:11:55] what God has said is the truth but be
[1:11:57] sure that your sins will always find you
[1:12:00] out if it doesn't here it'll get you to
[1:12:01] judgment so you're you're it's going to
[1:12:03] catch you somewhere now that's but if
[1:12:05] you are a true Christian truly called
[1:12:08] like Jonah was God's already got your
[1:12:10] fair paid get off of that ship going to
[1:12:14] t god predestinated you to this life yes
[1:12:18] sir if you're a true called child of
[1:12:21] God come to Christ come into the
[1:12:23] fullness of him your ways paid to where
[1:12:26] it's paid to Nineveh not to tarus you're
[1:12:30] predestinated your ship is a ship
[1:12:32] leaving right now on its road so there's
[1:12:36] only one thing to do is get on it and if
[1:12:38] you was like God you'll never have no
[1:12:40] peace like my little nephew a while ago
[1:12:43] about 10 years now he's went from Pillar
[1:12:45] To Post someone he goes to this church
[1:12:47] this Catholic Church down here and take
[1:12:49] this one it go what some Holy Father
[1:12:51] talks about over here and some other
[1:12:52] over here and some over what does it all
[1:12:54] amount to see now he's still hungering
[1:12:57] and thirsting I said your place is at
[1:12:58] the altar down there son see there's no
[1:13:01] way of getting out of it when God ever
[1:13:03] takes out at you you just might as well
[1:13:05] give up and go on that's all remember
[1:13:08] God God was in the boat God was in the
[1:13:11] storm God was in the fish every before
[1:13:12] he turned God was there see God's there
[1:13:16] and he just keep haunting at you so why
[1:13:18] do we wait any longer let's just start
[1:13:20] this revival right amen right what
[1:13:23] you're waiting on we believe that the
[1:13:25] coming of the Lord is at hand and he's
[1:13:27] going to have a bride it ready we don't
[1:13:29] want no ships any tares we're going to
[1:13:33] Nineveh we're going to glory amen that's
[1:13:37] right we're going where God's going to
[1:13:38] bless and that's what we want to do lay
[1:13:40] out in the presence of God then with our
[1:13:43] hearts not our hands so much but our
[1:13:45] hearts before God until he seasoned us
[1:13:48] through and through like that with a
[1:13:50] raise of his glory and baked into us his
[1:13:53] his goodness and ripen that which we
[1:13:55] have got into reality see to where we
[1:13:58] can show others that Jesus Christ lived
[1:14:01] oh my we want to be that and remember
[1:14:05] where Jonah went God was in the boat God
[1:14:08] was in the storm God was in the fish he
[1:14:11] went on being right along with Jonah
[1:14:13] until his perfect will was
[1:14:16] done that's right and if he's ever after
[1:14:19] you you might Dodge over here and Dodge
[1:14:21] over there but you'll be miserable until
[1:14:23] you come back and do the thing you start
[1:14:25] it out for him to do it the first place
[1:14:27] see don't go run from the presence of
[1:14:30] God face up to it you believe it's a
[1:14:33] truth then if it is a truth it's worth
[1:14:35] living for dying for anything else and
[1:14:38] if he's ever Vindicated to you that is
[1:14:40] the truth then we can't run from it no
[1:14:42] worry he'll be right there just the same
[1:14:44] he can't do it by his provided Prophet
[1:14:47] The Wanted he ordained to go down there
[1:14:50] and call that message now look like he
[1:14:51] could have sent another prophet
[1:14:54] but he ordained
[1:14:57] Jonah and even Elijah wouldn't have done
[1:15:01] Jeremiah wouldn't have done Moses
[1:15:03] wouldn't have done it was Jonah had to
[1:15:06] go to Nineveh that's all there was to it
[1:15:09] he commissioned him and told him to go
[1:15:11] and when he says go there Jonah go to
[1:15:14] Nineveh nobody else can go do that but
[1:15:17] Jonah and when God tells you something
[1:15:20] you've got to do it no body else see we
[1:15:24] just have to face up to it and and go do
[1:15:27] it we believe that we're living in the
[1:15:29] hour that when God is doing something we
[1:15:32] believe that we're living among them now
[1:15:35] I believe tonight I'm preaching to that
[1:15:38] congregation that it's laying waiting
[1:15:41] out there just to get right I I really
[1:15:43] believe that with all my heart I would
[1:15:45] that it's the same now as it's always
[1:15:47] been now we believe that the hour has
[1:15:49] come that St John 14:12 must be
[1:15:52] fulfilled we we believe that Malachi 4
[1:15:54] must be fulfilled we believe Luke 17:30
[1:15:57] must be fulfilled we believe that all
[1:15:59] these prophecies that he said would come
[1:16:01] to pass in this day we believe they must
[1:16:03] be fulfilled and we believe we're seeing
[1:16:06] them fulfilled right now that's exactly
[1:16:10] right stop running don't get out of his
[1:16:13] presence just move up into his presence
[1:16:15] that's right and I know that's what
[1:16:16] you're desired you do because I seen
[1:16:18] license out there from Texas and
[1:16:20] Louisiana and everywhere that's what
[1:16:22] we're here for is not to run from his
[1:16:25] presence but to run into his presence
[1:16:28] come back get off been of Jonah if
[1:16:31] you've been wondering which way to go or
[1:16:32] what to do come on get on the ship with
[1:16:35] us tonight we're going down to Tarsus to
[1:16:37] cry out Nineveh to cry out we're let
[1:16:39] that tarus ship go on down if you want
[1:16:41] to we've got a duty before God that's a
[1:16:45] message that we're responsible for so in
[1:16:47] this coming week just a little plude
[1:16:49] tonight to let you know when I'm crying
[1:16:51] out I'm solely responsible for our
[1:16:54] message Brethren you Minister sitting
[1:16:56] here I'm not here to hurt your feelings
[1:16:57] and you women and men on this marriage
[1:16:59] and divorce case coming up on you
[1:17:01] remember tonight I said all this to get
[1:17:03] this to you that I am responsible only
[1:17:06] to
[1:17:07] God and then again I'm responsible to
[1:17:09] you to tell you the truth and I'm not
[1:17:12] going to tell you nothing but the truth
[1:17:13] as long as God lets me know what truth
[1:17:15] is until I know the truth I won't say
[1:17:18] nothing about it I won't say nothing
[1:17:20] about it but I do believe that God shows
[1:17:22] me the truth on marriage and divorce and
[1:17:25] uh I trust that he'll let me bring it
[1:17:27] out and other messages I aim to have
[1:17:29] this week is who is this mdic where did
[1:17:32] God choose to put his name and a few of
[1:17:34] those things like that which are
[1:17:35] messages coming up and birth pains and
[1:17:38] and a few things on on that order and uh
[1:17:42] complimentary to a man choosing his wife
[1:17:44] and a few things of that messages I want
[1:17:46] to bring up this week but I just want
[1:17:48] the congregation where if there be a
[1:17:49] minister here I'm not here my brethren I
[1:17:52] don't want sh some of you members go
[1:17:53] back to your church and say brother Bram
[1:17:55] said thus and thus I am Duty bound to a
[1:17:58] message that's been given to me from
[1:18:01] almighty God as I stand here tonight and
[1:18:04] God knows that's true that right down on
[1:18:07] this River there's people perhaps
[1:18:08] sitting here when that angel of the Lord
[1:18:10] come down there and told me what he did
[1:18:11] right there in 1933 right down this
[1:18:13] Spring Street here if you're a stranger
[1:18:15] here dri right corner of Spring Street
[1:18:17] there we hit the river and there's where
[1:18:18] it happened that's been in 1933 it's
[1:18:22] probably been about 32 years ago and oh
[1:18:24] it's been 30 been 30 32 years ago 32
[1:18:29] years ago and how that he's brought that
[1:18:31] right down everything and we went out
[1:18:33] bringing the message and seen the sick
[1:18:35] healed the Blind and crippled and lame
[1:18:38] and Halt and everything and then seen
[1:18:41] even the dead that we know that's been
[1:18:43] verified raised up from the dead the
[1:18:45] people die and raised right back to life
[1:18:47] again and all these things if a message
[1:18:49] Goes Forth there signs and wonders and
[1:18:51] you still see that same old whole school
[1:18:53] of thought that you come up with that
[1:18:55] didn't come from God God don't just have
[1:18:57] to do God is trying to get your
[1:18:59] attention attracted to something and
[1:19:01] then when Jesus went out he started
[1:19:02] Healing The Sick and doing great works
[1:19:04] and things he all Jesus did it in Moses
[1:19:07] and Jesus done it in the rest of them
[1:19:08] and when he was sure he did it and he's
[1:19:10] doing it the same thing today when he
[1:19:11] sends forth a meeting like that revivals
[1:19:14] and starts a meeting in the earth and
[1:19:16] starts a moving along with these great
[1:19:18] signs and wonders then you see come back
[1:19:20] that same old school of teaching there
[1:19:22] there's something wrong there somewhere
[1:19:24] there's something new coming forth when
[1:19:26] Jesus came out after
[1:19:31] when he could go to any pulpit and
[1:19:33] preach when he was Healing The Sick well
[1:19:35] well they like to have more there but
[1:19:36] one day when he stood down and said I
[1:19:38] and my father are one brother he wasn't
[1:19:40] suppoer after that when he said except
[1:19:43] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[1:19:45] have no life in you but he that eats my
[1:19:47] flesh and drinks my blood has
[1:19:48] everlasting life and I'll raise him up
[1:19:50] at the last day then he wasn't poer man
[1:19:53] said this man's a vampire this man's a
[1:19:55] be that's where he done them things he
[1:19:57] could tell fortunes he looked through
[1:19:59] their their minds and perceived their
[1:20:01] thoughts he's a fortune tell about what
[1:20:02] it was he he was the word of God made
[1:20:05] manifest for that hour and he was Duty
[1:20:07] bound he said I do always that which is
[1:20:09] pleasing to my father God help us to do
[1:20:12] the same thing do that which is pleasing
[1:20:14] to the father and I hope you all
[1:20:16] understand if you disagree with me on
[1:20:18] these messages and things that you'll
[1:20:19] remember at least have this respect that
[1:20:22] I have a responsibility and I'm not
[1:20:24] going to Tara I'm on the road to Nineveh
[1:20:27] I got to cry out the Lord bless you all
[1:20:30] let us bow our heads now just a
[1:20:35] moment wasn't that a wonderful
[1:20:38] refreshing message of the commitment
[1:20:42] that you've got to have you know in
[1:20:45] that's a a especially good message if I
[1:20:48] would say that for young people you know
[1:20:52] uh this isn't a
[1:20:54] social gospel you know this isn't let's
[1:20:57] get all the young people together and
[1:21:00] let's find boyfriends and girlfriends
[1:21:02] and date this this is the preparation
[1:21:05] for the coming of the Lord and uh not
[1:21:08] the dancing and shouting and the feeling
