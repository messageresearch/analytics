[19:21] then all our visitors will welcome you
[19:22] as you invite brother mike for our
[19:24] songwriting and man god bless you
[19:40] good morning
[19:44] you can read psalm 29 this morning
[19:48] you know it begins with
[19:51] you know these sentences it says give
[19:53] unto the lord o ye mighty
[19:56] give unto the lord glory and strength
[19:59] give unto the lord the glory do unto his
[20:02] name
[20:03] worship the lord in the beauty of
[20:05] holiness
[20:07] you know that was part of a song
[20:10] that david sang in worship
[20:14] the day that the ark of the covenant was
[20:16] restored
[20:18] in its place in jerusalem
[20:21] you know it was the day that the
[20:23] presence of the lord
[20:25] you know that mercy seat
[20:28] he that dwells between the chair of him
[20:30] was set in its rightful place
[20:33] in their midst
[20:36] this is an effort that david had been
[20:37] working on for months years
[20:41] to restore
[20:44] that presence
[20:46] that ark to its rightful place
[20:48] you know there was great preparation
[20:50] involved in that
[20:54] it had his complete focus on getting
[20:55] that presence of the lord back in its
[20:57] rightful place in their midst
[21:00] it says in first chronicles 15 1
[21:03] and david made him houses in the city of
[21:05] david and prepared a place
[21:07] for the ark of god and pitched for it a
[21:10] tent
[21:11] says in verse 3 and david gathered all
[21:14] israel together to jerusalem
[21:16] to bring up the ark of the lord unto his
[21:19] place
[21:20] which he had prepared for it
[21:23] you know before that
[21:24] presence before that
[21:26] ark could be put in its proper place it
[21:30] had to be great preparation to make sure
[21:32] that everything lined up just
[21:35] just so
[21:37] everything had to be in its right place
[21:41] among between the ark and the people and
[21:43] how it was carried on and then this type
[21:45] of thing
[21:48] but when it that word that presence
[21:50] found its place there was now something
[21:52] acceptable that could be offered up
[21:55] it says in first chronicles 16 28-29
[21:59] almost a repeat of psalm 29 give unto
[22:02] the lord ye kindreds of the people
[22:05] give unto the lord glory and strength
[22:08] give unto the lord the glory do his name
[22:11] bring an offering and come before him
[22:14] worship the lord in the beauty of
[22:16] holiness
[22:18] only now
[22:19] with that presence in its proper place
[22:23] could an acceptable offering an
[22:25] acceptable worship
[22:27] be made
[22:29] you know as much that could be said here
[22:31] you know brother david's been speaking
[22:33] recently about the importance
[22:36] of finding that presence of the lord
[22:40] you know it's all about
[22:42] our position
[22:44] relative to his presence
[22:49] you know the thing that struck me as i
[22:50] was reading psalm 29 is his presence
[22:53] has an effect
[22:55] there's an impact
[22:57] of his presence
[22:59] you know moses there was an effect of
[23:01] the presence of the lord in moses's life
[23:04] you know here he was just caring about
[23:06] his daily business
[23:09] and you know he saw something that
[23:11] nobody else noticed no other shepherd
[23:13] turned to look at this thing but
[23:17] you know he could have kept walking
[23:20] he could have gone on home and been
[23:22] content with testifying that
[23:24] he saw a work of the lord
[23:27] you know he saw the presence of the lord
[23:29] there was something he saw there was
[23:30] something that happened one day
[23:32] and just been content to
[23:35] live his life fellowshipping around the
[23:37] goodness of what god had once done
[23:40] without there being an effect
[23:42] of that present
[23:45] you know it wasn't until
[23:48] he turned aside
[23:50] and it began to affect his walk
[23:53] that if the effect of that presence
[23:55] began to be made known
[23:58] in his life
[24:00] otherwise it was just a tale to tell it
[24:02] was just a sign that he could point to
[24:04] rejoice of something that god once did
[24:07] but until it affected him
[24:09] until it changed his walk
[24:13] that's when the presence
[24:16] began to have an impact
[24:19] you know it says in exodus 3 4 and when
[24:21] the lord saw that he had turned aside to
[24:24] sea
[24:25] god called him
[24:27] out of the midst of the bush and said
[24:29] moses moses and he said here am i
[24:33] not only did the presence have an effect
[24:34] but it had a voice
[24:38] and the moment he found his place in
[24:40] that presence that place where he was
[24:42] became holy ground
[24:44] an acceptable offering
[24:48] you know brother billy spoke
[24:50] last wednesday night about the effect of
[24:53] the presence on
[24:54] jacob
[24:56] that effect was is that he began to have
[24:59] a different walk
[25:00] he had a different identification
[25:03] he could now fulfill his place
[25:06] in the covenant
[25:08] you know it is interesting even back in
[25:10] genesis 3 8 when it talks about the
[25:12] voice of god walking in the midst of the
[25:15] garden
[25:16] the scripture calls that the presence of
[25:18] the lord because adam and eve hid from
[25:20] it
[25:21] so it has an effect it has a voice
[25:24] there's an impact of his presence you
[25:26] know we could all say amen that there
[25:28] was a voice
[25:29] a presence
[25:31] in our age
[25:32] in our generation
[25:35] but the question is is what effect
[25:39] has that had on us as individuals
[25:42] the effect of his presence isn't how you
[25:45] feel in a worship service
[25:47] but has your walk been changed
[25:50] has your identification been changed
[25:54] does the voice not the tape but the
[25:56] voice have an effect on us as
[25:59] individuals
[26:01] are we simply satisfied
[26:03] that god did a historical work
[26:06] and fellowship around the sign and the
[26:08] work and the things that were said and
[26:10] spoken are we satisfied with the
[26:12] doctrine or has the presence
[26:15] the voice have a continuous daily impact
[26:19] on our walk
[26:21] on our identification
[26:23] on our character
[26:25] you know as we read psalm 29 this
[26:27] morning we'll see that his presence his
[26:29] voice
[26:31] has an effect
[26:33] it
[26:34] causes births
[26:36] and it uncovers hidden secrets
[26:38] verse 9.
[26:41] it's all who truly come into that
[26:43] presence
[26:45] it brings glory to him in verse 9 his
[26:47] voice quickens
[26:49] and causes newness of life
[26:51] verse 6
[26:53] his voice tears down every institution
[26:56] every monument
[26:58] all things that appear strong
[27:01] are shaken
[27:03] that voice
[27:04] has an impact
[27:06] has an effect
[27:07] so as we read psalm 29 this morning i
[27:10] would just
[27:11] you know ask all of us the question
[27:13] myself included is that voice
[27:16] is that presence having an effect
[27:18] individually on our lives
[27:21] let's read psalm 29 together it's just a
[27:24] short
[27:24] psalm starting verse 1 give unto the
[27:27] lord o ye mighty give unto the lord
[27:30] glory and strength give unto the lord
[27:33] the glory do unto his name worship the
[27:36] lord in the beauty of holiness
[27:38] the voice of the lord is upon the waters
[27:41] the god of glory thundereth the lord is
[27:44] upon many waters the voice of the lord
[27:46] is powerful the voice of the lord is
[27:49] full of majesty the voice of the lord
[27:51] breaketh the cedars yea the lord
[27:54] breaketh the cedars of lebanon he maketh
[27:56] them also to skip like a calf lebanon
[27:59] and syrian like a young unicorn
[28:02] the voice of the lord divided the flames
[28:04] of fire the voice of the lord shaketh
[28:07] the wilderness the lord shaketh the
[28:09] wilderness of qadesh
[28:11] the voice of the lord maketh the hinds
[28:13] to calve and discovereth the forests and
[28:16] in his temple doth every one speak of
[28:19] his glory the lord sitteth upon the
[28:21] flood yea the lord sitteth king forever
[28:24] the lord will give strength unto his
[28:26] people the lord will bless his people
[28:29] with peace
[28:35] amen god bless you i have your seats
[28:40] [Music]

[28:43] the lamb is alive

[55:43] few verses
[55:45] of the scriptures and thank you
[55:47] musicians this morning

[55:58] sermon of the
[56:00] uh it is the rising of the sun
[56:03] and we're going to talk today about the
[56:05] chief offering
[56:06] so today we're going to try to go from
[56:08] paragraph 81 to 118
[56:12] and then tonight from 119 to 116
[56:17] so
[56:18] there's some just wonderful things this
[56:20] morning
[56:21] so uh
[56:22] we'll just rejoice and fellowship around
[56:25] the word of the lord so
[56:27] don't
[56:29] don't let condemnation come in
[56:31] uh if you love the lord and your heart
[56:34] has condemnation he's greater
[56:37] than your heart so let's just let's just
[56:40] soak up the word of god this morning
[56:43] in the beginning was the word
[56:47] and the word was with god
[56:50] and the word was god the gospel of saint
[56:53] john the
[56:55] very first chapter first verse
[56:59] in the beginning was the word and the
[57:01] word was with god and the word was god
[57:06] the same was in the beginning with god
[57:10] all things were made by him
[57:13] and without him
[57:15] was not anything made
[57:18] that was made
[57:21] in him was life
[57:23] and the life was the light of men
[57:27] and the light shineth in darkness
[57:30] and the darkness comprehendeth it not
[57:34] our gracious heavenly father
[57:36] we ask that you would bless your word to
[57:39] us this morning
[57:40] in jesus precious and holy name we pray
[57:44] amen
[57:45] amen god bless you may be seated
[57:52] before we listen to our
[57:55] our uh
[57:57] 22 minutes
[57:59] this morning of the message i'd like to
[58:03] say that
[58:05] one of the great
[58:07] understandings of the gospel in order to
[58:10] go
[58:11] further with god and understand the word
[58:14] of god
[58:15] is you've got to understand the
[58:17] sovereignty of god
[58:19] amen that in the beginning was god
[58:23] and
[58:24] anything that was made there's nothing
[58:26] that was made that wasn't made by him
[58:30] and being the maker he is
[58:34] the purpose the maker has a purpose why
[58:38] he makes something
[58:40] so everything that is done and
[58:42] everything that has happened and
[58:45] everything that comes forth is according
[58:48] to god's good pleasure
[58:51] his plan it's his design
[58:54] it's what he's chosen
[58:57] to do
[58:59] and he has the
[59:01] power over the clay peter says he says
[59:05] well why do men say why if god
[59:08] made me thus
[59:10] and he says well does not the potter
[59:12] have power over the clay to make one to
[59:15] honor and one to dishonor so you have to
[59:18] understand that in the beginning it was
[59:20] god
[59:22] and man has been trying to figure out a
[59:25] god that can only be known by revelation
[59:29] to whom he reveals himself he said to
[59:32] peter flesh and blood hath not revealed
[59:36] this to you but my father which is in
[59:39] heaven has revealed it to you
[59:42] and we know that faith and revelation
[59:45] are the same faith cometh by hearing the
[59:49] word of god but it's not just hearing
[59:52] it's re hearing or understanding or
[59:56] having the word of god
[59:58] revealed to you
[1:00:01] and so in understanding the sovereignty
[1:00:03] of god then we understand that anything
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:07] man would come up with
[1:00:09] outside what is revealed
[1:00:13] is fiction
[1:00:15] and so
[1:00:16] this we read this uh statement and it's
[1:00:19] in paragraph 63 of the same message
[1:00:22] he says now is there another gospel
[1:00:27] and now that's a great question so
[1:00:29] there's only one truth one true gospel
[1:00:33] there's only one true god there's only
[1:00:36] one god that sovereignly bringing
[1:00:39] everything to pass
[1:00:41] just the way that he designed it
[1:00:44] it's his will and it's his place and
[1:00:48] it's his purpose
[1:00:50] so it's it's not
[1:00:52] it it's not given to man to know god
[1:00:56] outside of revelation
[1:00:59] and and so
[1:01:01] by in understanding that what we pray
[1:01:04] for is we pray for revelation
[1:01:07] we pray father open my eyes that i might
[1:01:10] see
[1:01:11] in this age that we live in it's
[1:01:13] referred to as i sap
[1:01:16] i pray for i sav that i might see
[1:01:19] now we know that we're in the greatest
[1:01:22] times of conflict that our country's
[1:01:24] ever been in
[1:01:26] we know that there's wars and rumors of
[1:01:28] wars there's plagues there's sicknesses
[1:01:31] there's earthquakes and diverse places
[1:01:34] there's hurricanes there's storms i just
[1:01:37] don't know what greater picture
[1:01:40] could we draw to mankind that puts a
[1:01:44] call in our heart i need god
[1:01:47] i need god
[1:01:50] and
[1:01:51] i i was raised in a world that didn't
[1:01:54] have god i was raised in the catholic
[1:01:56] church we thought we were the ones we
[1:01:58] thought we had the pope
[1:02:00] you know the vicar of christ the one
[1:02:03] that
[1:02:04] could have all the answers and he's a
[1:02:07] failure and a church is a failure we
[1:02:10] know the scandal that rock the church
[1:02:14] just full of perversion beyond the thing
[1:02:17] and that carries the name of the lord
[1:02:21] i mean what we don't it's hard to face
[1:02:25] the reality of things sometimes
[1:02:28] but god is not against us
[1:02:32] he's for us you understand he doesn't
[1:02:35] want us to walk in darkness
[1:02:38] he wants us to walk in the light as he
[1:02:42] is the light and he was the light of men
[1:02:45] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:02:48] word was with god and the word is the
[1:02:51] life and the light of men it's by the
[1:02:55] word that you see
[1:02:57] it's by the word that you understand
[1:03:00] it's by the word you know what god has
[1:03:03] for you you know so many times man wants
[1:03:06] to place it on an experience and
[1:03:09] experiences are wonderful i love
[1:03:11] experience i love to dance i love the
[1:03:13] shout i love those things i'm speaking
[1:03:16] in tongues but they're not the light
[1:03:20] you understand they're momentary
[1:03:24] blessings
[1:03:25] but they don't give you vision down the
[1:03:27] road they don't give you vision to the
[1:03:29] right they don't give you vision they
[1:03:31] don't it doesn't give you an
[1:03:33] understanding if it's a moment terrible
[1:03:36] personal
[1:03:37] uh
[1:03:39] maybe joy
[1:03:41] but you can't walk by it
[1:03:44] but you can walk by the light
[1:03:47] and that's what we're to be in is be in
[1:03:49] the light
[1:03:50] and that's when satan came to
[1:03:52] test him and tempt him on the mountain
[1:03:55] he said it is written it is written it
[1:03:59] is written the word said the word said
[1:04:02] because the word was the light of the
[1:04:05] circumstance
[1:04:09] that was the truth of it
[1:04:11] it's the word
[1:04:13] and and so the word is what
[1:04:18] the sovereignty of god
[1:04:21] expressed
[1:04:22] in other words i made it all
[1:04:25] i made it all for a purpose i had a
[1:04:28] reason in doing everything i've done
[1:04:30] it's not given to you to figure it out
[1:04:33] it's given to me
[1:04:36] god taking full responsibility
[1:04:38] to reveal it to you
[1:04:42] if you'll accept it
[1:04:45] he didn't put us in a maze and say find
[1:04:48] your way out
[1:04:51] he was the light of men he was the life
[1:04:54] of men
[1:04:55] and so he said is there another gospel
[1:04:58] paul spoke of it
[1:05:01] to one of groups he said i'm so
[1:05:04] surprised that you've turned to another
[1:05:06] gospel which there is no other
[1:05:10] but a make-believe gospel
[1:05:13] now i don't want a make-believe gospel
[1:05:17] i don't want a make-believe experience
[1:05:21] i don't want a temporary experience
[1:05:25] i want something that's genuine
[1:05:28] down inside and grips my
[1:05:32] my soul
[1:05:36] not something that's acceptable
[1:05:39] by
[1:05:40] by the norm
[1:05:43] or acceptable by approval of those that
[1:05:46] are around me i want it to be a personal
[1:05:50] ex
[1:05:51] expression
[1:05:53] of
[1:05:53] knowing that he loves me
[1:05:56] and that his love that he has shown me
[1:06:00] would would cause my heart
[1:06:04] to
[1:06:05] love him in return
[1:06:08] we love him because
[1:06:11] he
[1:06:12] first loved us
[1:06:14] you can't love him
[1:06:16] until you understand the love that he
[1:06:19] has for you
[1:06:21] now you might be going through all kinds
[1:06:23] of internal conflicts and you know
[1:06:25] teenage rebellion and social rebellion
[1:06:28] and all that thing but let me tell you
[1:06:30] something about this world this world's
[1:06:32] going to pass away
[1:06:34] but my word will not pass away
[1:06:38] civilizations have gone by
[1:06:41] i love a great lover of history i've
[1:06:43] been to the pyramids it's hard to
[1:06:45] believe that the people that built those
[1:06:47] are no more
[1:06:49] and and man has went to the grave
[1:06:52] forever but praise god we've got one
[1:06:54] that's come to the from the grave
[1:06:57] so he said this he said he says it's
[1:07:00] just a make-believe gospel to a
[1:07:03] denominational fiction
[1:07:07] of fiction
[1:07:08] now we don't
[1:07:10] want fiction
[1:07:12] so the only thing that ends of fiction
[1:07:16] is the truth
[1:07:18] the only thing that ends a lie
[1:07:21] is the truth the only thing that ends a
[1:07:24] deception
[1:07:25] is the truth
[1:07:27] because the truth
[1:07:29] is what sets you free
[1:07:34] and if the truth is what sets you free
[1:07:38] and we even see it in abraham
[1:07:41] when lot was brought into
[1:07:46] bondage abraham beat this
[1:07:48] his plowshares into swords and went out
[1:07:52] to recover his own
[1:07:55] and god is going to recover his own
[1:07:58] he's going to find his own he's going to
[1:08:01] find what he planted
[1:08:04] he's going to germinate it he's going to
[1:08:07] nourish it and he's going to harvest it
[1:08:11] god can do anything but fail
[1:08:15] and so this is when we approach this
[1:08:19] this morning
[1:08:21] as we begin to listen
[1:08:23] we we want to begin to understand that
[1:08:26] this is the sovereignty of god
[1:08:30] it was god's way
[1:08:33] it was god's plan it was what god chose
[1:08:37] to do
[1:08:38] and he's revealed that look at us this
[1:08:40] morning we're from everywhere
[1:08:43] and it's to show beyond a shadow of a
[1:08:47] doubt that this gospel is not given to
[1:08:50] the flesh it's given to the spirit
[1:08:55] amen
[1:08:56] and all of us live by his spirit
[1:09:01] and so
[1:09:02] we're going to
[1:09:03] if you have your bibles and brother
[1:09:06] brahms going to go to a scripture
[1:09:09] that we can
[1:09:12] read
[1:09:13] and and so to this point
[1:09:15] we've talked about the
[1:09:19] everything that was made was made by him
[1:09:22] and so we've been talking about the type
[1:09:26] of nature
[1:09:28] that's where we've been romans
[1:09:31] 1 and 20 says the invisible things of
[1:09:33] god are clearly seen by the visible
[1:09:36] things that are created around us that's
[1:09:39] a paraphrase but
[1:09:41] so we've been studying that as the s-u-n
[1:09:45] has come up how it brought seed to life
[1:09:49] so the invisible things of god are go
[1:09:51] ahead and put romans up if you can
[1:09:53] romans 1 20 we'll just spend
[1:09:56] just one quick
[1:09:58] uh
[1:09:59] second on on that before we move
[1:10:03] uh
[1:10:04] forward so romans 1 20 says for the
[1:10:08] invisible things of him
[1:10:10] from the creation of the world are
[1:10:13] clearly
[1:10:15] seen
[1:10:17] okay so that's the word of god
[1:10:21] so that word of god as we'll see here in
[1:10:23] a little bit is being presented to us
[1:10:26] the the invisible things of him
[1:10:29] from the creation of the world are
[1:10:32] clearly seen
[1:10:34] so what do we see we see the rising of
[1:10:37] the sun we see the seed being planted we
[1:10:40] see the seed coming up we see it coming
[1:10:43] to harvest and coming to fruit
[1:10:47] so we know that god planted that's why
[1:10:49] he sent the s u n in the first place
[1:10:53] because he knew he had seed he had a
[1:10:56] purpose for that seed he had a fruit in
[1:10:59] that seed and so now we can clearly see
[1:11:02] in nature and by the creation of the
[1:11:06] world are clearly seen the invisible
[1:11:08] things of god
[1:11:11] so
[1:11:12] by those things we know
[1:11:15] that there's something in us
[1:11:18] that god wants to bring up for
[1:11:20] that's a good thing to ask yourself
[1:11:24] am i am i
[1:11:27] desiring
[1:11:28] to be what god wants me to be am i
[1:11:32] desiring to come into the sovereignty of
[1:11:35] god am i desiring to let him mold me and
[1:11:38] make me and reveal in me his will in my
[1:11:42] life
[1:11:45] that's a great question
[1:11:48] we don't want to add god to our program
[1:11:55] i want to be what god wants me to be
[1:11:58] i want to be what he wants me to be
[1:12:00] where he places me
[1:12:04] and i walk by faith
[1:12:07] i'm not questioning
[1:12:09] i'm saying i want to have the fellowship
[1:12:13] with him and if i can't have the
[1:12:15] fellowship where i am then it's a good
[1:12:20] sign to you
[1:12:23] that where you're at needs some
[1:12:25] adjustments
[1:12:27] maybe it just needs house cleaning
[1:12:30] just like i would suggest i i would
[1:12:32] never
[1:12:34] hear me
[1:12:37] i would never give up my teenage
[1:12:39] daughter or son
[1:12:41] a phone
[1:12:42] without having some parental guidance
[1:12:46] attached to it
[1:12:49] and if they don't want it
[1:12:51] they don't get it
[1:12:55] you want a phone i'm going to know who's
[1:12:57] texting you i'm going to know what
[1:12:59] you're watching i'm going to know the
[1:13:01] devils that are trying to get in your
[1:13:03] life so we can have a prayer meeting at
[1:13:06] your bedside before we go to bed but
[1:13:09] don't you put that devil
[1:13:11] in one of your daughter's hands because
[1:13:14] i'll guarantee you there will be a big
[1:13:16] old devil texting her
[1:13:19] hi sweetie baby
[1:13:22] have you ever considered this
[1:13:24] have you ever thought of this have you
[1:13:27] ever tried this
[1:13:32] yeah
[1:13:34] joke i don't know i've i've i know
[1:13:36] there's some out there some say bark's
[1:13:39] the best i thought well bark bark yeah
[1:13:41] somebody's gonna bark
[1:13:43] i think i'll bark
[1:13:45] but don't do it
[1:13:50] it's easy for us
[1:13:52] to fall into amnesia
[1:13:55] and not to realize there's real
[1:13:58] events
[1:14:00] taking place
[1:14:02] so the invisible things of god so we
[1:14:04] talked about that the type of nature
[1:14:08] the type how the sun came out how it
[1:14:10] brought the seed out how it had to come
[1:14:13] to maturity and we talked about the uh
[1:14:16] the the rising and how that the seed
[1:14:19] come forth and how it rise now we're
[1:14:22] going to talk what after that
[1:14:24] resurrection
[1:14:27] what does god do
[1:14:30] and now we're to this place in the
[1:14:32] church where we're going to talk about
[1:14:34] the sheaf
[1:14:36] offering
[1:14:37] how according to the word of
[1:14:40] god what was supposed to be
[1:14:43] waived over us
[1:14:45] and when we get to
[1:14:47] paragraphs 83 to 89
[1:14:50] that that's some of the best explanation
[1:14:54] that i can find to why that we
[1:14:58] have service
[1:15:00] on
[1:15:01] sunday
[1:15:02] so we'll start with 81 and he's going to
[1:15:04] go to the book of leviticus
[1:15:06] the 23rd chapter
[1:15:09] and the ninth verse and we'll
[1:15:12] listen to those and then we'll listen to
[1:15:17] this part and then the 82nd paragraph he
[1:15:20] says when you get to your place
[1:15:22] and your position
[1:15:24] and i believe that that concerns that
[1:15:27] the the the
[1:15:29] time
[1:15:31] the age that we're in the time
[1:15:34] the church
[1:15:36] and the individual god god saves the
[1:15:40] world the church and the individual all
[1:15:42] the same
[1:15:44] way
[1:15:44] and so this is real good word
[1:15:48] now
[1:15:48] it's better than what you can learn
[1:15:51] in college
[1:15:54] because how many had well i i didn't
[1:15:58] attend college
[1:15:59] but at the university i went to
[1:16:02] that stuff still working
[1:16:05] i went some day to somebody else and
[1:16:07] someone looked me and says well we don't
[1:16:08] do it that way anymore so what do you
[1:16:10] mean 20 years we've done that no we
[1:16:12] don't twist those things on wires
[1:16:15] anymore we do this and
[1:16:16] forget that you guys are it's
[1:16:18] old-fashioned
[1:16:19] now it works
[1:16:21] and that's why we like the old-fashioned
[1:16:23] gospel so we're going to listen to 22
[1:16:25] minutes of old-fashioned gospel
[1:16:27] we're going to talk about it
[1:16:29] and we're going to understand what that
[1:16:32] we're a part of the living word
[1:16:36] that we're a part of so god bless you
[1:16:38] this morning i believe you'll enjoy this
[1:16:40] next few minutes
[1:16:52] i'd like for you to turn to another
[1:16:53] scripture
[1:16:54] i got wrote down here it might help you
[1:16:56] a little
[1:16:57] it's found in the book of leviticus the
[1:17:00] 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse
[1:17:05] listen close in the law of levitical law
[1:17:08] god speaking to moses
[1:17:11] listen
[1:17:13] all these things are types now
[1:17:17] and we'll stop here for a few moments
[1:17:19] to get into this type
[1:17:21] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:17:25] speak unto the children
[1:17:27] of israel and say unto them when you
[1:17:30] come into the land which i give unto you
[1:17:35] unto the place of position
[1:17:40] that i have given unto you
[1:17:42] now you speak to the children of israel
[1:17:46] that when you get to this certain place
[1:17:49] that i promise you
[1:17:52] i take you
[1:17:54] when you get there in this land now
[1:17:56] speaking natural here type in the
[1:17:58] spiritual
[1:17:59] and shall reap the harvest thereof you
[1:18:02] may receive what i told you
[1:18:05] thereof then you shall bring
[1:18:07] a sheep
[1:18:09] of the first fruits of your harvest
[1:18:13] unto the priests
[1:18:14] and he shall wave the sheep before the
[1:18:17] lord
[1:18:19] to be accepted for you
[1:18:23] all tomorrow after the sabbath
[1:18:27] the priest shall weave it
[1:18:30] if there would be any holy ritual
[1:18:34] it should come forth on the sabbath day
[1:18:38] which was the seventh day of the week
[1:18:41] which is saturday
[1:18:43] but did you notice
[1:18:46] in this memorial
[1:18:48] the wave it on the
[1:18:50] first day of the week
[1:18:54] the sheep
[1:18:56] which was the first
[1:18:58] of your seed that you planted
[1:19:01] when it comes up and ripen
[1:19:04] you cut down this sheep
[1:19:07] and take it to the priest
[1:19:10] and let him take it and wave it before
[1:19:12] the lord
[1:19:14] for your exception
[1:19:16] that you are accepted you have come with
[1:19:19] your sheep
[1:19:21] and he used to wave it before the lord
[1:19:23] on
[1:19:24] not on the sabbath
[1:19:26] the seventh day but on the first date
[1:19:29] which we call
[1:19:30] sunday
[1:19:35] of s-u-n-d-a-y
[1:19:35] that's a roman uh word
[1:19:38] which they called it the sunday for the
[1:19:40] sun god but how it is changed it's not
[1:19:44] s-u-n anymore it's the
[1:19:47] s-o-n-d-a-y the sunday
[1:19:51] that that part of wheat
[1:19:54] god's first one up from the dead
[1:19:58] is to be waived over the congregation
[1:20:03] that we
[1:20:04] are
[1:20:05] his seed and that's the first of the
[1:20:08] seed of gold the threat
[1:20:11] waved upon the first day of the week on
[1:20:14] sunday he raised up
[1:20:17] wave
[1:20:18] goodbye
[1:20:19] and ascended up on high
[1:20:22] in the presence of the people notice
[1:20:25] it was the first corner of god's wheat
[1:20:28] that had been raised from the dead god's
[1:20:32] first corner wheat by god's quickening
[1:20:35] power
[1:20:36] god had quickened his life raised him up
[1:20:39] from the dead and he was the first
[1:20:41] fruits of those that slept
[1:20:44] the first fruit he was that sheep that's
[1:20:46] why they had to weigh that sheep
[1:20:48] or it was the first one that come to
[1:20:51] maturity
[1:20:53] and it was weighed as a memorial of
[1:20:56] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[1:20:59] rest of them would come
[1:21:00] there was a sign
[1:21:02] and today because he was the first
[1:21:06] son of god to come to full maturity to
[1:21:09] be in god
[1:21:10] he was plucked up from the earth and
[1:21:13] it's waved over the people
[1:21:15] oh what a glorious lesson
[1:21:18] by the quickening power the first one
[1:21:21] although it had been typed in many times
[1:21:23] and we'll see later he was typed but
[1:21:26] this is really the first fruits of them
[1:21:28] to slept
[1:21:29] he was waved
[1:21:31] over
[1:21:32] the promised
[1:21:33] seed
[1:21:34] that had promised of life he was waved
[1:21:38] at the day of pentecost when there came
[1:21:40] a sound from heaven like a waving mighty
[1:21:44] russian wind
[1:21:45] and was waved over the people
[1:21:48] the pentecostal people that was up at
[1:21:50] pentecost waiting for
[1:21:53] the blessing to come
[1:21:54] and to be waived
[1:21:57] again we realized in the last days
[1:22:00] according to luke 17 30 in the sunday
[1:22:03] again in the days that the etho in of
[1:22:05] man
[1:22:06] will be revealed or waived again over
[1:22:09] the people
[1:22:11] who is the son of man
[1:22:12] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:22:16] word was with god and the word was god
[1:22:20] and the word would say flesh and dwelt
[1:22:22] to
[1:22:24] and of all the teaching that we have in
[1:22:26] confirmation of the word of god by word
[1:22:30] of god by signs by wonders
[1:22:33] we see the day that in the book of of
[1:22:36] luke here as we just quoted from the
[1:22:40] luke the 17th chapter 31st and malachi 4
[1:22:43] in the different scriptures that we are
[1:22:45] acquainted with that that word again
[1:22:49] is ways over the people that the dead
[1:22:52] traditions of man is dead and the shot
[1:22:55] of god is alive again with the baptism
[1:22:59] of the holy spirit right among us has
[1:23:01] given us life
[1:23:05] as christ was the first one to raise
[1:23:09] from all the prophets and so forth all
[1:23:12] those times in many places he was the
[1:23:14] first fruits of those who slept and the
[1:23:16] bride coming of christ coming out of the
[1:23:19] church there'll have to be a sheep wave
[1:23:22] to get in the laces
[1:23:25] oh
[1:23:28] waiting of the sheep what was the sheath
[1:23:31] the first one that come to mature
[1:23:34] the first one that proved it was a wheat
[1:23:37] that proved it was a sheep
[1:23:40] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[1:23:44] it was waved over the people
[1:23:47] and the first time there will come forth
[1:23:49] for the broad age for a resurrection out
[1:23:52] of dark denominationalism it will be a
[1:23:55] message
[1:23:57] that the form of turkey on the word has
[1:23:59] turned back again in its full power and
[1:24:02] being weighed over the people by the
[1:24:04] same signs and wonders that he did that
[1:24:06] day
[1:24:07] all right it's called alien
[1:24:10] he live also
[1:24:12] speaking to his wife
[1:24:14] because ali
[1:24:16] you live also what a resurrection
[1:24:20] that that was and what a resurrection
[1:24:23] this is
[1:24:24] to be quickened from the dead
[1:24:27] to be made alive in christ jesus by
[1:24:31] god's quickening power
[1:24:33] he was waved to them
[1:24:35] the word
[1:24:36] which he was was way back to him on the
[1:24:38] day of pentecost the word made manifest
[1:24:42] now
[1:24:43] as i say to be waved again in the last
[1:24:45] days
[1:24:47] now for instance
[1:24:48] you say when i awaken it brother abraham
[1:24:51] i know what church that well i do too
[1:24:54] but now praises what if if we were going
[1:24:57] to go back
[1:24:58] to tucson this afternoon
[1:25:02] now and each one of us
[1:25:04] had a was going to go in a
[1:25:06] a big cadillac brand new
[1:25:10] and all of the seats
[1:25:12] were made out of absolute skin
[1:25:16] softest of the leather
[1:25:18] soft and easy to sit in
[1:25:20] and the floorboards
[1:25:22] were plush
[1:25:24] the steering wheel were nickel plated
[1:25:27] and had diamond studs all over it
[1:25:29] and the engine was mechanically
[1:25:32] tested to be exactly the right engine
[1:25:37] and the wheels were all had bearings and
[1:25:40] breeze up
[1:25:42] and the tires were all puncture proof
[1:25:45] and blow out free
[1:25:47] all been tested scientifically
[1:25:50] they've been pushed off the assembly
[1:25:52] lines both of them and both of them
[1:25:54] filled up with gasoline
[1:25:57] that's the running power
[1:25:59] the gasoline because it is the oxygen
[1:26:03] but now
[1:26:05] when you're going to start them
[1:26:09] all don't bulk up look just alike
[1:26:12] but there's one of them don't have any
[1:26:15] spark
[1:26:18] any firing power
[1:26:21] well you say the power is in the
[1:26:23] gasoline brother brand
[1:26:25] but i don't care how much power is in
[1:26:27] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[1:26:29] there
[1:26:31] to manifest those powers
[1:26:34] that's there's a power there
[1:26:36] to confirm that this gasoline it just
[1:26:39] might as well be water
[1:26:42] until no matter how much theologians
[1:26:45] claim
[1:26:46] how well you got your church set
[1:26:49] how much education you got how much like
[1:26:51] the bible until that wave sheath
[1:26:55] until the holy spirit
[1:26:58] comes upon that person to quicken that
[1:27:02] word
[1:27:03] the gasoline represents the word it's
[1:27:05] the truth but without the spirit it
[1:27:07] won't move
[1:27:11] we put too much
[1:27:14] stress on the mechanics and nothing on
[1:27:16] the dynamics
[1:27:19] it needs the dominating power of god the
[1:27:22] resurrection power of jesus christ upon
[1:27:25] the church to manifest him
[1:27:28] and to bring to pass that this is
[1:27:31] gasoline
[1:27:34] it might be in a gasoline can it could
[1:27:37] still be water
[1:27:41] see
[1:27:42] but the only proof of it is put this
[1:27:45] life on it
[1:27:47] and it'll prove where it's getting sweet
[1:27:50] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[1:27:53] in the denomination you're as much as
[1:27:56] trying you could get a splatter
[1:28:00] you
[1:28:01] ruin your engine by getting it full of
[1:28:03] carbon
[1:28:05] but oh i'm so bad
[1:28:08] that there is a ten thousand
[1:28:11] power
[1:28:12] the word of god and a holy ghost light
[1:28:14] it up
[1:28:15] and to resurrect the power of god into a
[1:28:19] man's life or a woman's life or into a
[1:28:22] church that shoved that cadillac down
[1:28:24] the road
[1:28:28] on the dynamic power
[1:28:30] of the holy ghost
[1:28:31] which came back to us ways over the
[1:28:33] people at the day of pentecost
[1:28:35] making him the same yesterday today and
[1:28:37] forever
[1:28:39] that was the first sheep come up from
[1:28:40] all the prophets which was the son of
[1:28:42] god the king of all prophets
[1:28:45] there's been churches churches brides
[1:28:46] brides churches rise pride but there's
[1:28:49] got to come one
[1:28:52] hallelujah
[1:28:54] there has become a real bride
[1:28:56] there must come one that's not only got
[1:28:58] the mechanics but the dynamic shut up
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:03] makes that church live
[1:29:08] in the power of his resurrection
[1:29:12] until we come to that place
[1:29:14] until we find that place what good does
[1:29:17] it do to polish the hubs
[1:29:20] what good does it do to give her a
[1:29:21] facelift or a simoniz job
[1:29:25] when there's no dynamics in it
[1:29:27] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[1:29:29] to be right
[1:29:31] there's got to be a dynamic to make it
[1:29:32] work
[1:29:34] that's what he proves
[1:29:39] that's what easter proved
[1:29:42] he wasn't only the word but he was god
[1:29:45] himself the dynamics in the
[1:29:50] word body of jesus christ
[1:29:53] whole stepping dead in the grave shaken
[1:29:56] to life and rise again and roll away
[1:30:01] i am he that was dead
[1:30:03] so dead till the sun said he was dead
[1:30:06] the moon said he was dead the stars said
[1:30:08] he was dead all nature said he was dead
[1:30:11] now the whole world has to recognize
[1:30:13] that he's alive again
[1:30:15] he was not only the mechanics
[1:30:17] god's word he was a dynamic to prove it
[1:30:21] and is he being the group
[1:30:25] the blood has to come forth god is part
[1:30:27] of him
[1:30:28] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:30:32] the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:30:34] and the others that spoke of the bride
[1:30:36] it can only manifest if it does
[1:30:38] something different from the groom it
[1:30:40] isn't the bride
[1:30:42] because she's flesh of his flesh
[1:30:45] bone of his bone life of his life power
[1:30:49] of his power
[1:30:51] she is him
[1:30:54] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[1:30:56] from his side
[1:30:58] she had taken his spirit the family
[1:30:59] spirit coming the flesh from his side
[1:31:02] made both mechanics and dynamics the
[1:31:05] wife
[1:31:07] the spirit of him
[1:31:09] and the flesh of him
[1:31:11] and put it together and made mechanics
[1:31:13] and dynamics
[1:31:14] and until the church or the people all
[1:31:17] these easter bunnies and turtles and big
[1:31:20] churches and pirates will fail and pass
[1:31:23] away until that church become full time
[1:31:27] and the kenneth
[1:31:29] and the spirit of god that moved him to
[1:31:31] do the things that he did
[1:31:33] if he hit on 16 cylinders
[1:31:36] so
[1:31:38] hey
[1:31:40] why is that in john 14 12
[1:31:42] see that believer told me
[1:31:45] the words that i do shall he lose hope
[1:31:50] amen i'll give him a charge of my
[1:31:53] dynamics and his mechanics
[1:31:56] that's the world
[1:32:10] the mechanics without the dynamics
[1:32:13] no good
[1:32:14] neither is the dynamics without the
[1:32:15] mechanics
[1:32:17] you can scream and shout and jump up
[1:32:18] down all you want to and deny this word
[1:32:20] amen
[1:32:22] you won't do any good
[1:32:23] you're just cranking around them the
[1:32:25] pistons have got sparked out of fire but
[1:32:27] no gas in the far back
[1:32:29] it'll only work as they come together
[1:32:33] amen
[1:32:35] so one will set steel and the other will
[1:32:36] go up
[1:32:38] that's the only thing there is to it yes
[1:32:40] they both might look like both claim to
[1:32:41] be churches proclaim to be brides but
[1:32:43] one has
[1:32:45] mechanics and dynamics
[1:32:47] it brings it to pass
[1:32:49] but what he said is the truth
[1:32:51] it just
[1:32:52] won't no matter how good the mechanics
[1:32:55] is until the dynamics comes
[1:32:57] when the time enemy comes that bar is
[1:33:00] made to connect with that octane in the
[1:33:02] gasoline
[1:33:03] and when that exposures it causes
[1:33:06] a combustion
[1:33:08] and that combustion moves
[1:33:12] every motion ever moved
[1:33:14] for he is the same
[1:33:16] yesterday
[1:33:17] today and forever
[1:33:19] that's the research
[1:33:21] that's the real power of god
[1:33:23] but
[1:33:24] with the dynamics
[1:33:26] notice
[1:33:27] it's the spirit that quickly
[1:33:30] it's the it's the spark that fires
[1:33:34] it's not the that fires it's a spark
[1:33:36] that fires again
[1:33:38] you can do nothing without me but with
[1:33:41] me you can do all things
[1:33:44] as he is the words the father living
[1:33:46] father sent me so send i you as the
[1:33:48] father has fired me and pushed me into
[1:33:50] everything i do only that which is
[1:33:52] pleasing to god
[1:33:53] now as he sent me sir sandai it was the
[1:33:56] same mechanics
[1:33:57] and it takes the same dynamics to
[1:33:59] operate it and these signs shall follow
[1:34:01] them that claim to have the mechanics
[1:34:04] the dynamics will take its place paul
[1:34:06] said the gospel came to us not in word
[1:34:08] only through gasoline only but through
[1:34:10] spark also
[1:34:11] to make it move
[1:34:13] there you are it came to us in that
[1:34:15] manner
[1:34:16] it's the same spirit that raised him up
[1:34:19] that quickened the true believer to
[1:34:21] eternal life
[1:34:29] did you get all
[1:34:30] that i'm still trying
[1:34:34] but let's just take a moment and just
[1:34:37] walk back through it
[1:34:39] just a little bit as we
[1:34:42] look at some of the wonderful things
[1:34:45] he's pointing out to us
[1:34:48] he says
[1:34:49] in 82 he says unto your place
[1:34:52] your position
[1:34:54] and you know we've talked a lot about
[1:34:56] that the positioning of the church
[1:34:59] and where that we are
[1:35:01] and i believe the church is coming to
[1:35:04] the position
[1:35:06] in other words the maturity it's coming
[1:35:09] to the place
[1:35:10] where the genuine
[1:35:13] can be manifested
[1:35:15] and
[1:35:16] we had to come up by the hearing of the
[1:35:19] word of god faith comes by hearing and
[1:35:21] hearing by the word of god
[1:35:23] it was it was a mistake
[1:35:26] that people thought
[1:35:28] that
[1:35:29] azusa street
[1:35:31] was
[1:35:32] the fulfilling
[1:35:34] of the word
[1:35:36] of god but let us just follow this
[1:35:38] through
[1:35:39] so we understand it took the sovereignty
[1:35:41] of god and when the church got to its
[1:35:43] place
[1:35:45] it then in its position
[1:35:48] and it got to the place that it could be
[1:35:50] fruitful in others it had matured up it
[1:35:53] had grown up to the harvest then you
[1:35:55] took the first fruits of that in the
[1:35:57] natural and waved it and i thought this
[1:36:00] was beautiful i hope that you caught it
[1:36:03] when he came through this
[1:36:05] through 84-86
[1:36:07] he says not the sabbath the seventh day
[1:36:10] but the first day which was called
[1:36:13] sunday that was the day it was waived in
[1:36:17] other words it was the day
[1:36:19] that that seed came to maturity was on
[1:36:23] the first day of the week that's why we
[1:36:26] have service on sunday
[1:36:28] we're we're recognizing the day
[1:36:31] that the that that seed
[1:36:34] that that that first one from the dead
[1:36:37] the first one that came forth from the
[1:36:40] dead
[1:36:42] i was dead and now i'm alive forevermore
[1:36:45] the first one of all those that have
[1:36:48] gone before the first one that brought
[1:36:50] the life for all those that are in the
[1:36:53] future because i live you shall live
[1:36:55] also that's why we come together on
[1:36:58] sunday it's a celebration of the
[1:37:01] resurrection it's the celebration of the
[1:37:04] first fruit it's a celebration of what
[1:37:08] all the other days brought forth
[1:37:11] and that's why when people they try to
[1:37:13] say well the law says
[1:37:16] but we're free from the law of sin and
[1:37:19] death we are now living in the law of
[1:37:22] life and liberty look we don't celebrate
[1:37:25] the law that kept us in bondage we
[1:37:28] celebrate the life that has brought us
[1:37:31] to liberty
[1:37:33] and so this is a beautiful thing why
[1:37:35] that
[1:37:36] why was it because it was on the first
[1:37:39] day
[1:37:41] that the fruits of what god planted
[1:37:44] in all the prophets
[1:37:46] in all the prophecies and all the psalms
[1:37:51] and everything all the scriptures that
[1:37:53] were prophesying and all the types that
[1:37:57] were all given this was the day
[1:38:00] that the fruit of all that and all of
[1:38:04] what they prophesied was manifested and
[1:38:07] to be proved true so we don't celebrate
[1:38:11] the sabbath which is the prophecies we
[1:38:14] celebrate the fulfillment of the
[1:38:16] prophecies what was the resurrection
[1:38:21] so you know when you get a lot of times
[1:38:23] at high school or college or wherever
[1:38:25] you are someone will try to come with
[1:38:27] the sabbath and and they'll try to come
[1:38:30] with the law and they'll come with all
[1:38:32] these all these things from
[1:38:35] their point of view
[1:38:37] well you understand
[1:38:39] why that you do it
[1:38:42] yes that was good until
[1:38:45] the sheaf offering was waved until the
[1:38:48] first fruit of what's promised
[1:38:52] and it won't be long you'll find out
[1:38:54] they don't believe in a baptism of the
[1:38:56] holy ghost
[1:38:58] they don't believe in an indwelling
[1:39:00] spirit of the lord jesus christ coming
[1:39:03] into your life
[1:39:05] the same spirit
[1:39:07] that was in him
[1:39:08] in you that's what we're talking about
[1:39:11] that's what you can have
[1:39:13] this is what god's offering
[1:39:16] and so we look down so we see that
[1:39:18] through those verses through 89 he says
[1:39:20] that's why they waved had to waive that
[1:39:24] sheaf 89. for it was the first one to
[1:39:28] come to maturity
[1:39:30] it was waived as a memorial of
[1:39:32] thanksgiving to god believing that the
[1:39:35] rest of them would come it was a sign
[1:39:39] so that's what it is
[1:39:42] that we celebrate that's why that we
[1:39:45] celebrate on sunday not out of tradition
[1:39:49] we don't con when you come to church
[1:39:51] don't come here
[1:39:53] just because it's sunday and we go to
[1:39:56] church on sunday come to church knowing
[1:39:58] what you're doing
[1:40:00] knowing lord i'm honoring the fact that
[1:40:03] you rose from the dead that this is a
[1:40:05] memorial
[1:40:07] to the resurrection
[1:40:09] that and why that i'm here this morning
[1:40:13] is is not to be condemned of sin i'm
[1:40:16] here because you're alive
[1:40:18] you're real
[1:40:21] and and you said if two or three of us
[1:40:24] gather together that you'd be in our
[1:40:26] midst and if you're the same yesterday
[1:40:29] today and forever and you're here with
[1:40:31] us now you can do what you've always
[1:40:34] done
[1:40:38] you can make a difference in your life
[1:40:42] you can take my guilt away you can take
[1:40:44] my fear away you can take my depression
[1:40:47] away you can take my anxiety away you
[1:40:50] can take my sickness away lord i've come
[1:40:53] here because i'm in need of you
[1:40:56] i'm not in condemnation because i'm sick
[1:41:00] i'm not in condemnation because i'm
[1:41:02] struggling i'm not in condemnation
[1:41:05] because i'm a failure
[1:41:07] because i can do anything without you
[1:41:10] but what i am here to do is to come at
[1:41:12] your feet and say i'm a sinner and i
[1:41:15] need your presence i need you to come
[1:41:18] into my life and make a change in my
[1:41:21] heart
[1:41:22] and make me that i'm not barren and
[1:41:25] unfruitful
[1:41:27] that's why we're here
[1:41:30] if it becomes a religious ceremony
[1:41:33] then they're just as good as we are
[1:41:35] worshiping on saturday
[1:41:39] but we come on sunday
[1:41:42] with with with an understanding
[1:41:46] of why
[1:41:48] that we worship on this day because it's
[1:41:51] the first day it's the day that the
[1:41:54] first fruit came out of the grave it's
[1:41:57] the day that all what those prophets
[1:41:59] prophesied
[1:42:00] all what they were looking forward to
[1:42:02] all what they were talking about finally
[1:42:05] manifested now there was eternal life
[1:42:08] back in the presence
[1:42:10] of men
[1:42:11] to do exceedingly and abundantly
[1:42:14] above what we could ask or think
[1:42:17] so it's a beautiful thing
[1:42:20] any time that you do something
[1:42:24] with with understanding the intention of
[1:42:27] what you're doing
[1:42:30] you get the benefits of it
[1:42:33] if you don't you walk out and you say
[1:42:35] why did i come here
[1:42:38] why did i come here
[1:42:40] i come here this morning because i'm
[1:42:42] needy
[1:42:45] i've got a job to do but i'm trusting
[1:42:48] that the holy spirit will minister to me
[1:42:53] even as i look at this word i believe
[1:42:56] that he can minister to me
[1:42:58] that he can when i step out of this
[1:43:01] anointing that comes with the word of
[1:43:03] god and i'm just left alone without the
[1:43:06] gift being operated and without the
[1:43:08] calling because different callings are
[1:43:10] without repentance when i stand all
[1:43:12] alone out away from the word and out
[1:43:14] away from the anointing that just me and
[1:43:17] him
[1:43:20] if i never preached another sermon
[1:43:23] i could know that he could take me by
[1:43:25] the hand
[1:43:26] and lead me
[1:43:28] to that land
[1:43:31] that that that he's so real
[1:43:35] that i know in my heart beyond a shadow
[1:43:39] of a doubt i'm not questioning it
[1:43:41] i'm not worrying about i've got no
[1:43:44] question that i know that there's life
[1:43:46] after death
[1:43:47] i know that there's a heaven i've
[1:43:49] cleansed that out of my mind the
[1:43:51] question's not going i know because he
[1:43:54] lives i live also that's what he says
[1:43:57] that's what he says to his wife
[1:44:02] amen that that's
[1:44:05] what what we do we do
[1:44:07] and and so we we that's why that in
[1:44:11] those verses we come to the
[1:44:12] understanding and and the scripture says
[1:44:15] can you study to show yourself approve
[1:44:17] that you can give an answer to all men
[1:44:21] okay and so
[1:44:23] and you'll be challenged on it
[1:44:26] but you've got an answer
[1:44:28] you've got a reason
[1:44:30] you can explain that that first fruit
[1:44:33] was waved the first one that came out of
[1:44:35] the grave
[1:44:37] it's ever it it's you know i want to
[1:44:40] worship somebody that's alive
[1:44:45] not go back and say well they killed the
[1:44:47] lamb
[1:44:49] on the sabbath
[1:44:51] they offered the lamb yes
[1:44:53] yes
[1:44:55] you're you're celebrating the offering
[1:44:58] i'm celebrating when the lamb came alive
[1:45:01] i'm celebrating not what put him in the
[1:45:02] grave i'm celebrating when he took
[1:45:04] victory over the grave and he and he
[1:45:07] raised up and he's put death in hell
[1:45:10] behind them
[1:45:12] that's what we celebrate you understand
[1:45:14] why we celebrate sunday you understand
[1:45:17] not because america celebrates sunday
[1:45:19] they don't celebrate sunday in church
[1:45:21] anymore they sell it at a football field
[1:45:28] but we know why so i i just thought that
[1:45:32] was beautiful that you could just the
[1:45:34] first fruits that's what we're from the
[1:45:36] quickening power of god manifested
[1:45:39] quickened his life
[1:45:41] he was that chief
[1:45:43] amen and then it was waived at pentecost
[1:45:48] amen so we celebrated coming up
[1:45:51] out of the ground because if he stayed
[1:45:53] there
[1:45:55] then we'd know we'd stay there
[1:45:57] we'd all be sitting wondering what the
[1:45:59] next step is
[1:46:01] what happens next what happens next
[1:46:04] if when you put me in the ground if god
[1:46:06] chooses that to be you won't wonder what
[1:46:09] happens next
[1:46:11] you say i wonder what's going to happen
[1:46:13] to brother mcgary next
[1:46:15] can you imagine everybody they put in
[1:46:17] the ground they never had that question
[1:46:18] answered what happens next what's next
[1:46:21] what after this oh job he got to there
[1:46:24] what becomes of a man
[1:46:26] and all of a sudden that god flashed
[1:46:28] that lightning across them he says
[1:46:30] although the squinted worms eat my flesh
[1:46:32] yet i'll see god he knew what happens
[1:46:35] next
[1:46:36] amen this is why we're here today
[1:46:39] because we know what happens next
[1:46:43] amen aren't you glad of that
[1:46:49] i know what happens next
[1:46:52] glory to god
[1:46:57] i hate it when i don't know what's
[1:46:58] happening
[1:47:01] people call me up and say i'd like to
[1:47:02] sit down and visit with you i want to
[1:47:04] know what for
[1:47:05] i'll start asking a question will you
[1:47:07] kind of give me a general idea what this
[1:47:09] about i hate being blindsided
[1:47:13] praise god satan can't blindside us now
[1:47:17] he can't blindside with cancer he can't
[1:47:19] blindside us with nothing because we
[1:47:22] know what happens now
[1:47:25] hallelujah
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:30] i wish i had known that in high school
[1:47:32] every time i took a test i knew i was
[1:47:33] going to flunk i'd say but least i know
[1:47:35] what happens next
[1:47:39] this off don't mean failure because he
[1:47:41] can't fail
[1:47:44] amen
[1:47:46] and that's
[1:47:47] so he says now today because he was the
[1:47:49] first fruit god come to full maturity
[1:47:52] that's why we what a glorious lesson
[1:47:56] now he said this is in types so we're
[1:47:58] going to drop down to nine anyway he
[1:48:01] said that wave to the pentecost there
[1:48:03] came a sound of from heaven like a
[1:48:06] waving
[1:48:08] i like that
[1:48:10] amen there it was you go wait
[1:48:12] until you're endured with power
[1:48:14] from on high this message gets really
[1:48:17] rich we're just starting to break into
[1:48:19] it right now
[1:48:21] i i want to skip all this and go right
[1:48:24] to what's next
[1:48:26] and then to what's next
[1:48:29] amen
[1:48:31] so
[1:48:32] we see that now let's take a second here
[1:48:36] and look at verse
[1:48:40] 92
[1:48:43] i mean verse i'm sorry paragraph it says
[1:48:47] and to be waived again
[1:48:50] we realize
[1:48:51] in the last days
[1:48:54] according to luke 17 30
[1:48:57] in the sun day afghan again
[1:49:01] it says as it was in the days of noah
[1:49:05] so shall it be
[1:49:07] in the coming of the son of man
[1:49:10] so he's telling us now
[1:49:13] that the
[1:49:15] this is a promise
[1:49:18] to the gentile church
[1:49:21] remember the first one was waived
[1:49:25] at the day of pentecost which
[1:49:27] we call
[1:49:28] is like the second exodus
[1:49:32] okay so he was he he came up and all
[1:49:34] those that were dead before he was the
[1:49:38] first fruit and they came and appeared
[1:49:40] to many
[1:49:43] okay so that that that that was the
[1:49:45] first fruit
[1:49:47] of that now
[1:49:48] there's a gentile church
[1:49:51] another wife
[1:49:54] that he's saying because i live you
[1:49:56] shall live also
[1:49:59] and now he's got to wave that over them
[1:50:03] too
[1:50:04] the great
[1:50:05] uh sheep offering the great
[1:50:08] wave offering
[1:50:10] and so
[1:50:11] he said
[1:50:13] he was the wave of the day of pentecost
[1:50:15] when there came a wave of russian
[1:50:17] and was to be waived over the people at
[1:50:19] pentecostal people
[1:50:21] that was up at pentecost waiting for the
[1:50:23] blessing to come
[1:50:25] and to be waived again we realize in the
[1:50:28] last days
[1:50:30] according to
[1:50:33] luke 17 30
[1:50:35] in the day of the son of man will be
[1:50:38] revealed or waved again
[1:50:41] over the people what is being revealed
[1:50:46] the the sheep wave offering is what the
[1:50:49] word
[1:50:52] it's the word the true word not the
[1:50:54] fiction
[1:50:56] not this not the uh
[1:50:58] not the
[1:51:00] man-made gospel
[1:51:02] but the true
[1:51:04] word of god the truth
[1:51:07] what was in god's mind what was in his
[1:51:10] thinking what what the whole program was
[1:51:13] from in the beginning what if i could
[1:51:15] say it this way what was made
[1:51:22] you understand this was made in the
[1:51:25] beginning all things that made nothing
[1:51:28] that was made that he didn't make
[1:51:31] so what is being waived over you is
[1:51:34] really what god made
[1:51:38] it's not a fiction
[1:51:41] it's not a story
[1:51:44] it's a reality
[1:51:46] of god's truth
[1:51:49] amen
[1:51:51] not a
[1:51:53] a
[1:51:55] choice
[1:51:56] test
[1:52:01] you know let's talk i always like true
[1:52:03] and false
[1:52:05] i figure i can at least get 50 50.
[1:52:09] i might know some and then the rest i'd
[1:52:10] guess
[1:52:13] it ain't multiple choice
[1:52:16] you understand god can't reveal anything
[1:52:20] that is in him
[1:52:23] amen
[1:52:26] that's where people just can't man can't
[1:52:29] get away
[1:52:31] to bringing themselves into subjection
[1:52:34] and humbling themselves
[1:52:37] to the plan that god had made
[1:52:45] beautiful
[1:52:47] now he said who is the son of man
[1:52:52] in the beginning was the word
[1:52:54] and the word
[1:52:56] was with god and the word was god and
[1:52:59] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:53:02] us
[1:53:03] that's what's being waived and we'll get
[1:53:06] to it just in a second
[1:53:09] he said
[1:53:11] and
[1:53:12] if all the teachings that we have
[1:53:16] the confirmation of the word of god
[1:53:19] by the word of god by signs and wonders
[1:53:23] we see today
[1:53:25] in the book of luke
[1:53:27] here
[1:53:29] that as we just quoted
[1:53:32] luke the 17th chapter and the 30th verse
[1:53:36] and malach thai 4 5 and different
[1:53:39] scriptures
[1:53:40] that we are acquainted with
[1:53:43] that that word again is waved over the
[1:53:47] people
[1:53:50] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[1:53:54] and the son of god is alive again with
[1:53:58] the baptism of the holy spirit among us
[1:54:01] and is giving
[1:54:03] us
[1:54:04] life
[1:54:06] he was the life
[1:54:08] of men
[1:54:10] you understand he's he's giving he he's
[1:54:13] giving us life
[1:54:16] and so we find out that that's the
[1:54:18] promise
[1:54:21] you understand that was the promise the
[1:54:23] promise was that malachi 4 5 would be
[1:54:26] waived luke 17 30 would be waived
[1:54:29] revelations 10 7 that's the reality of
[1:54:32] god that's what god's done that's what
[1:54:36] was promised
[1:54:38] and we'll just follow this through so we
[1:54:40] can tie this together
[1:54:43] he says
[1:54:44] he says wave the sheep
[1:54:47] what is the sheath the first one that
[1:54:49] come to maturity the first one that
[1:54:52] proved it was wheat that proved it was
[1:54:56] was sheep now if it isn't
[1:55:00] it it isn't the
[1:55:02] that's why he couldn't come from
[1:55:04] denominations
[1:55:07] now everybody thought azusa street
[1:55:11] right was was the
[1:55:13] uh
[1:55:14] the feeling of the holy spirit
[1:55:18] and the baptism of the holy spirit but
[1:55:20] the baptism couldn't come
[1:55:23] until the sheep offering was waived
[1:55:27] so it proved it wasn't it
[1:55:31] because what did it do it went right
[1:55:33] back and denominated
[1:55:37] so something
[1:55:39] had to come
[1:55:41] with the power
[1:55:43] of the resurrection
[1:55:45] the same signs and the same wonders that
[1:55:48] he did
[1:55:49] somebody that was one with him
[1:55:53] the works that i do shall you do also so
[1:55:57] there had to be somebody come on the
[1:56:00] scene that could reimpersonate
[1:56:05] the gift
[1:56:07] that jesus christ displayed
[1:56:09] showing that it wasn't him it was the
[1:56:12] power of god the life the dynamics in
[1:56:16] him
[1:56:17] that man and spirit had become one
[1:56:23] hallelujah
[1:56:27] and that the rest of them
[1:56:31] would come to that same place
[1:56:36] it had to be waved over
[1:56:40] couldn't come from denomination
[1:56:42] couldn't come from teaching
[1:56:44] because
[1:56:45] somebody that could come and show the
[1:56:48] mystery
[1:56:52] of the grave
[1:56:56] you know what the seals are it's the
[1:56:57] mystery of the grave
[1:57:02] it's the mystery
[1:57:04] that put all of us in the grave
[1:57:07] religious grave
[1:57:09] denied us marked us with trinity
[1:57:11] doctrine marked us with all kinds of
[1:57:13] false things and false conceptions of
[1:57:16] god
[1:57:17] living in a denominational fiction
[1:57:20] thinking that we're going to be saved
[1:57:22] jesus himself said unless ye be born
[1:57:25] again you shall not enter the kingdom of
[1:57:27] heaven
[1:57:30] and he didn't put that on us he said i'm
[1:57:34] here
[1:57:34] to birth you
[1:57:39] what do you think he's doing in this day
[1:57:41] he's saying i'm here to birth you
[1:57:44] not make you shout not make you run in
[1:57:46] circles praise god if you do but to make
[1:57:48] the word and you become one someone said
[1:57:52] we had to go up there and get them kids
[1:57:54] the holy ghost i thought did you get
[1:57:56] them the word
[1:57:57] did you get them the sheaf offering did
[1:58:00] you give them luke 17 30 and malachi 4 5
[1:58:04] and revelations 3 14 is that what you
[1:58:06] give them
[1:58:08] if you didn't give them that you didn't
[1:58:10] give them life
[1:58:15] amen
[1:58:17] the truth
[1:58:20] listen
[1:58:25] he couldn't it couldn't come from
[1:58:27] denomination
[1:58:29] it wasn't an azusa street experience
[1:58:32] it wasn't bringing people to identify
[1:58:36] themselves with an experience
[1:58:41] giving you a false evidence
[1:58:46] if you know me you know me
[1:58:51] a lot of people know me
[1:58:53] they don't exactly shout when they see
[1:58:54] me
[1:58:58] but they know me
[1:59:00] a lot of people avoid me
[1:59:03] i don't blame him
[1:59:06] but when you know him you know him
[1:59:10] how do you know him you only know him by
[1:59:12] one thing
[1:59:13] his characteristics his identification
[1:59:18] and what is his identification i do
[1:59:21] nothing
[1:59:22] until the father has revealed it to me
[1:59:25] me and the father
[1:59:26] are one
[1:59:28] i live by his word
[1:59:30] i i do i i do what he reveals to me
[1:59:37] we're one
[1:59:38] father i pray
[1:59:41] that they may be one
[1:59:42] as we are one
[1:59:44] that the love wherein yet you love me
[1:59:47] and i love them that they'll enter into
[1:59:49] that capstone
[1:59:51] they'll enter into that love
[1:59:55] let me tell you something
[1:59:56] when you start running after experiences
[2:00:00] and feelings it's because you're dodging
[2:00:02] the truth
[2:00:06] you're dodging the fact
[2:00:08] that you haven't confessed your sins
[2:00:11] a hundred percent
[2:00:13] then you haven't died out to yourself
[2:00:16] and that's your resurrection you're
[2:00:17] putting on a religious covering
[2:00:20] and there's no need to do that
[2:00:23] because he's here to forgive you of
[2:00:25] every unrighteousness and every failure
[2:00:28] he's here to give you life
[2:00:30] beyond anything you can imagine he's not
[2:00:33] against you he's for you
[2:00:39] chad you don't need something to
[2:00:43] those leopards weren't ashamed to go to
[2:00:46] because they had leprosy
[2:00:48] they said i got never see
[2:00:51] i always liked the story of the woman
[2:00:52] that washed his feet
[2:00:55] prophet of god said she sat there with
[2:00:57] that oil and she said if i go wash his
[2:01:00] feet
[2:01:01] he will know what i did to get this
[2:01:04] money
[2:01:08] and then she said
[2:01:10] but he's the only one
[2:01:12] that can help me
[2:01:16] oh wouldn't you like to
[2:01:18] hear paul harvey do something on her
[2:01:20] life
[2:01:21] the rest of the story
[2:01:23] i imagine she prospered
[2:01:25] and was a shining light
[2:01:28] who knows all that god did
[2:01:31] for her
[2:01:34] so we see this
[2:01:38] as as we follow down he talks about the
[2:01:40] the cadillac
[2:01:42] remember they can both look identical
[2:01:44] they can have everything the same they
[2:01:47] can have
[2:01:48] they're both cadillac they're both
[2:01:49] filled
[2:01:50] with with the word of
[2:01:52] god
[2:01:54] don't think that these people that are
[2:01:56] in denominations don't have the word of
[2:01:57] god
[2:01:58] they'll embarrass you
[2:02:04] they don't have a tape to listen to
[2:02:08] they read them scriptures
[2:02:10] they read the books of their
[2:02:11] denominations that tell him how to
[2:02:13] interpret the scripture
[2:02:15] don't think you're going to walk into
[2:02:17] somebody and use your intellect
[2:02:20] i've heard the prophet of god say many
[2:02:22] times i i don't know the book like a lot
[2:02:24] of you do but i know the author real
[2:02:26] well
[2:02:28] and he's here
[2:02:29] and i take every spirit in this building
[2:02:31] under my control
[2:02:35] what good is it the word without the
[2:02:36] life
[2:02:39] so we're just going to jump down here
[2:02:42] until we saw in 97 that he's speaking to
[2:02:46] his wife
[2:02:47] i just think that's beautiful he talks
[2:02:49] about the cadillac he talks about it all
[2:02:51] being exactly the same
[2:02:54] everything being right but let's just
[2:02:57] take just
[2:02:58] a moment to really
[2:03:02] uh
[2:03:03] look at this
[2:03:06] part here
[2:03:07] he says
[2:03:09] paragraph 103
[2:03:11] no matter how much theologians claim
[2:03:17] how well
[2:03:19] you got your church set
[2:03:23] how much education you got
[2:03:27] how much like the bible
[2:03:31] until
[2:03:32] that wave sheath
[2:03:35] until the holy spirit comes upon that
[2:03:39] person to quicken that word
[2:03:43] the gasoline represents the word
[2:03:46] it's the truth
[2:03:48] but without the spirit it won't move
[2:03:52] so it doesn't matter how much you got
[2:03:55] everything laid out how much perfect you
[2:03:57] are
[2:03:59] nothing is going nothing is going to be
[2:04:03] brought to life
[2:04:05] until the word
[2:04:08] i hope i can say this right
[2:04:10] is waved over you
[2:04:14] to prove that it's gasoline
[2:04:18] now what is waived
[2:04:22] okay he said what is the sheep offering
[2:04:26] what is it it's the word
[2:04:28] that's waved
[2:04:30] now
[2:04:31] we miss it sometimes because we think it
[2:04:35] was this
[2:04:36] discernment that was waived or the
[2:04:39] miracles that was waived no
[2:04:42] here's what was waived what was waived
[2:04:45] was luke 17 30.
[2:04:48] so all of a sudden here comes the
[2:04:50] ministry of the son of man
[2:04:52] which is deity
[2:04:54] dwelling in a prophet
[2:04:58] that deity
[2:05:01] comes out
[2:05:04] and knows the secrets of the heart
[2:05:07] it was luke 17 30 that was waved
[2:05:12] it was malachi 4 that was waved it
[2:05:15] wasn't the vindication that was waived
[2:05:18] it was the word in flesh
[2:05:21] being waived
[2:05:24] i'm going to wave malachi 4 5 in front
[2:05:27] of you behold i send you elijah the
[2:05:30] prophet before the great and dreadful
[2:05:32] day i'm going to wave luke 17 30 as it
[2:05:35] was in the days of noah as it was in the
[2:05:38] days of sodom so shall it be in the
[2:05:41] coming of the son of man that's what he
[2:05:43] was waving
[2:05:46] waving revelations 3 14
[2:05:50] under the idea
[2:05:51] under the angel of lady osea write these
[2:05:54] things
[2:05:58] you're blind miserable poor wretched and
[2:06:00] don't know it that's what was being
[2:06:02] waived
[2:06:04] the word was being waived
[2:06:06] to prove
[2:06:09] if the gasoline
[2:06:10] was gasoline
[2:06:15] because that's
[2:06:16] what
[2:06:17] ignited
[2:06:19] the word
[2:06:21] now we're just on the
[2:06:23] beginning of this
[2:06:25] joel
[2:06:28] 2 25 was waved
[2:06:31] all the cankerworm all the palmer worm
[2:06:35] what so much of his way john
[2:06:37] john
[2:06:38] 4 12
[2:06:40] unless a corn of wheat fallen to the
[2:06:42] ground
[2:06:45] how many times did you hear him talk
[2:06:46] about the corn of wheat going to the
[2:06:48] ground coming up in luther what was that
[2:06:52] that was the word
[2:06:55] being waived over the people
[2:06:58] it wasn't it wasn't the signs and
[2:07:00] wonders and the miracles that just
[2:07:02] vindicated
[2:07:04] that it was the word
[2:07:06] it proved that it was a word it
[2:07:08] identified
[2:07:10] that this was the word because it did
[2:07:12] the same things he did a lot of people
[2:07:15] pray for the sick
[2:07:18] but you won't see them turn their back
[2:07:20] to the audience
[2:07:27] i don't know if
[2:07:28] my wife read to me the daily altar today
[2:07:32] it was beautiful i was gonna play it i
[2:07:34] was so inspired brother andrew sent me a
[2:07:36] a little clip the other day i was so
[2:07:38] inspired that i was gonna play it maybe
[2:07:41] i'll play it tonight
[2:07:43] but he talks about a woman that comes up
[2:07:48] to him
[2:07:49] and and he talks and he says
[2:07:50] he says oh
[2:07:52] you've got arthur
[2:07:54] you
[2:07:55] your knees are bad you've been in a car
[2:07:57] accident
[2:07:58] she says that's true and you got a short
[2:08:01] bald doctor she said that's true
[2:08:04] you've got
[2:08:05] you've got arthritis in your knees and
[2:08:07] now the skin is starting to rot around
[2:08:10] the joint that's true
[2:08:12] she says can i help can you help me
[2:08:18] and
[2:08:19] he says
[2:08:20] no but jesus can help you
[2:08:25] and he's provided a way
[2:08:29] says do you believe she says i believe
[2:08:32] with all my heart
[2:08:36] and then
[2:08:37] he says well go to the altar and kneel
[2:08:40] down she says no
[2:08:42] i'm gonna kneel right here
[2:08:44] where he saved me
[2:08:46] and where he healed me
[2:08:48] and she knelt down right there
[2:08:51] got up and skipped off the platform
[2:08:57] why
[2:08:58] that was luke 17 30.
[2:09:01] that was malachi 4 5. waved over the
[2:09:04] people
[2:09:08] so you can't get there
[2:09:12] you can't make it it won't be the real
[2:09:15] thing
[2:09:19] without that sheep offering waved over
[2:09:21] it
[2:09:22] it'll be so close
[2:09:25] that will deceive the very elect
[2:09:27] but the truth of it
[2:09:30] the non-fiction of it
[2:09:32] the true church is not going to get it
[2:09:34] by the experience
[2:09:36] they're going to get it by the word
[2:09:42] and god by the giving
[2:09:45] of divine revelation
[2:09:48] of the word the church is built on
[2:09:51] revelation
[2:09:54] god revealing to you
[2:09:56] that this is
[2:09:58] him it's him
[2:10:02] not a fiction
[2:10:03] it doesn't need my help i'm not ashamed
[2:10:06] of it god used william mary and branham
[2:10:10] as the vessel
[2:10:12] the first fruit that came to maturity
[2:10:16] not out of denomination not out of man
[2:10:18] but the first one that came to maturity
[2:10:21] out of the divine revealed word of god
[2:10:24] coming to pass
[2:10:26] that was what was waived
[2:10:31] go ahead build
[2:10:32] whatever you want to build
[2:10:35] on the past
[2:10:37] but the true bride
[2:10:39] has got to come forth
[2:10:42] sorry
[2:10:45] he says when you try to put the holy
[2:10:47] spirit in a denomination you're just as
[2:10:50] much trying you'll get a sputter
[2:10:53] boy isn't that the truth
[2:10:56] i've never seen so much butter
[2:10:59] how many people are just dropping like
[2:11:01] flies
[2:11:06] you don't drop
[2:11:08] if you're in his palm
[2:11:10] because he said nothing can pluck you
[2:11:12] out of my pawn
[2:11:14] i i i implore you
[2:11:17] like i'm imploring my own life
[2:11:19] make
[2:11:20] sure
[2:11:22] you're calling make sure your experience
[2:11:25] with him find a closet find a place
[2:11:28] someplace talk it over with him till you
[2:11:31] know you and him are one
[2:11:33] and if you don't understand it that's
[2:11:35] fine you can say lord i don't understand
[2:11:37] all the doctrine but i know you
[2:11:39] and i know you'll never leave me and
[2:11:41] you'll never forsake me
[2:11:44] he says it won't move we have put too
[2:11:46] much stress on the mechanics
[2:11:49] and nothing on the dynamics
[2:11:55] i i could just preach
[2:11:58] we've got the mechanics
[2:12:00] that's all we've stressed
[2:12:02] church order the messenger of the hour
[2:12:05] the doctrines who we are that's just
[2:12:08] mechanics
[2:12:10] who we are as a mechanic
[2:12:15] it's it's i'm a cadillac
[2:12:21] there's a lot of cadillacs
[2:12:25] did you did you hear what he said
[2:12:27] i i just i just thought this was so
[2:12:29] marvelous there's been churches churches
[2:12:32] brides brides church's bride's brides
[2:12:36] i thought you got to be kidding me
[2:12:41] really
[2:12:42] i don't even want to say i'm bride i'm
[2:12:45] bride
[2:12:48] been
[2:12:49] we walk around like we're the bride
[2:12:53] that's new no it's not
[2:12:57] we we got this whole exclusivity
[2:13:01] that's all built
[2:13:03] on us patting one another on the back
[2:13:06] our own fellowship
[2:13:08] there's only one fellowship there's only
[2:13:10] one place that god provides for worship
[2:13:14] and that's under the shed blood of jesus
[2:13:16] christ it's him and him alone
[2:13:20] and that's what he said
[2:13:23] he said
[2:13:27] he said it it's the power of god that
[2:13:29] shoves the cadillac down the road
[2:13:31] there's been all kinds of of brides
[2:13:35] brides
[2:13:36] but there's got to come oh hallelujah
[2:13:39] there has got to come a real bride
[2:13:42] there must come one
[2:13:45] that's not
[2:13:46] only got the mechanics
[2:13:48] but the dynamics
[2:13:51] makes the church live
[2:13:54] move
[2:13:55] in the power of the resurrection
[2:13:59] i believe that that's where we've come
[2:14:02] to
[2:14:04] that we put our faith
[2:14:06] in the mechanics and all our leadership
[2:14:10] has been from the mechanics
[2:14:12] but now there's another leadership i'm
[2:14:15] dying to get into that message
[2:14:17] leadership
[2:14:18] where
[2:14:19] jesus he kept all the law
[2:14:21] he went to the temple he he did the
[2:14:24] works he kept all the things but then
[2:14:27] there was a part of him that said i have
[2:14:29] need to go by here
[2:14:31] there was another leadership
[2:14:34] of the dynamics
[2:14:36] there's a leadership of mechanics
[2:14:39] which is obedience
[2:14:42] i'm led to pay my tithe i'm led to give
[2:14:45] offering i'm led to assemble myself
[2:14:48] together i'm led to apply via token to
[2:14:51] my house and kick out the tv i'm led not
[2:14:54] to read this i'm led not to listen to
[2:14:56] this i'm led to be kind and gentle and
[2:14:59] peace and and those things that's all
[2:15:02] the leadership i'm led by the spirit
[2:15:05] into the statue of a perfect man but now
[2:15:07] there's another leadership
[2:15:09] when those mechanics
[2:15:12] are in place
[2:15:14] which the mechanics represents the flesh
[2:15:18] that now there's something that says the
[2:15:20] power comes to move you
[2:15:24] go here
[2:15:26] do this
[2:15:28] i have an unction
[2:15:32] another time first just not to hide in
[2:15:35] the car
[2:15:37] it's time to drive what we've got
[2:15:40] it's time to put on display
[2:15:44] that this is the word not manufacture it
[2:15:48] not go run to a hospital
[2:15:52] and say i've got the power of god i'm
[2:15:54] filled with the spirit of god i lay my
[2:15:57] hands on you and satan i command you
[2:16:01] to come out
[2:16:03] yeah you'll find out you're talking to a
[2:16:05] son of cephas right there
[2:16:12] i know a man that was praying
[2:16:14] and so he come i'm a woman come up he's
[2:16:16] going to pray for
[2:16:17] he lay his hand he starts commanding
[2:16:19] that devil and everything and she just
[2:16:21] punched him in the face and got down and
[2:16:23] started beating him he said call the
[2:16:25] authorities call the authorities she
[2:16:27] really does have a devil
[2:16:36] spirits are real
[2:16:38] god delivers his children of spirits
[2:16:41] praise god
[2:16:42] thank god
[2:16:44] but it's not we don't have to produce
[2:16:47] anything
[2:16:49] you understand this is what he's saying
[2:16:51] we don't have to produce anything the
[2:16:53] mechanics is set we need the spark
[2:16:57] we need that spark of the spirit that
[2:16:59] spark of leadership that spark of holy
[2:17:02] unction
[2:17:06] he teach a beautiful message called hear
[2:17:08] ye him
[2:17:10] something that's real i don't want to
[2:17:12] live a life
[2:17:13] that i've lived
[2:17:17] that i polished the hubcaps
[2:17:20] and and kept the mechanics in shape all
[2:17:23] my life and he never told me to drive it
[2:17:27] anywhere
[2:17:31] show me your faith
[2:17:33] without your works
[2:17:35] and i'll show you my faith by my works
[2:17:37] what is the works the works is obedience
[2:17:40] to that still small voice
[2:17:44] remember closing
[2:17:46] here he says
[2:17:50] he says until the church becomes both
[2:17:52] dynamics 113.
[2:17:55] both dynamics and mechanics
[2:17:57] now so we put all the emphasis
[2:18:02] on the mechanics paragraph 111 he says
[2:18:05] and
[2:18:05] he says as he being the groom the bride
[2:18:09] has to come forth
[2:18:12] because it's part of him
[2:18:15] and it can only be
[2:18:17] the manifestation
[2:18:20] of the fulfilling
[2:18:23] of all the revelations
[2:18:26] and others has spoke of the bride
[2:18:32] it can only manifest
[2:18:35] if it does
[2:18:36] something different from the groom it
[2:18:39] isn't the bride
[2:18:41] because she's flesh of his flesh
[2:18:44] bone of his bone
[2:18:45] life of his life
[2:18:47] power of his power she
[2:18:50] is
[2:18:51] him
[2:18:54] now we're going to hold that because
[2:18:55] tonight we're going to talk about
[2:18:58] the other quickening
[2:19:01] here we're talking about the quickening
[2:19:03] of our what our spirit
[2:19:06] tonight we'll talk about the quickening
[2:19:08] of our body
[2:19:12] he said
[2:19:14] because she is flesh of his flesh just
[2:19:16] as a man and a woman are one taking from
[2:19:19] aside she is taking the spirit and
[2:19:23] feminist spirit from him the flesh of
[2:19:26] his side made both mechanics and
[2:19:28] dynamics the spirit of him
[2:19:32] and the flesh of him
[2:19:34] put it together and makes the mechanics
[2:19:37] in the dynamics
[2:19:39] and tell
[2:19:40] the church
[2:19:42] and tell the church or the people
[2:19:44] see in other words it's the flesh of him
[2:19:48] and the spirit of him
[2:19:51] so
[2:19:52] we have to be spirit
[2:19:56] and then our flesh
[2:19:59] has to come in
[2:20:01] to subjection
[2:20:02] i can't help but say it
[2:20:05] because we'll go through it
[2:20:07] but how he quickens your spirit
[2:20:10] he can all that same power will also
[2:20:12] quicken your flesh
[2:20:14] we take that scripture of romans and we
[2:20:17] keep thinking it means the resurrection
[2:20:20] it doesn't mean the resurrection it
[2:20:22] means this resurrection now
[2:20:25] this flesh coming out of corruption and
[2:20:28] sin and coming into the dynamic power of
[2:20:31] god where the spirit
[2:20:33] and the flesh
[2:20:35] are dwelling
[2:20:37] in harmony
[2:20:40] oh
[2:20:44] my flesh
[2:20:45] wars
[2:20:47] but i can bring it under subjection
[2:20:50] by the dynamic quickening power of god
[2:20:53] so it's in harmony
[2:20:55] with the word of god
[2:20:57] amen and then we'll just
[2:20:59] close he said
[2:21:02] until the church becomes both dynamics
[2:21:04] and mechanics
[2:21:06] and the spirit of god that moved him
[2:21:09] to do the things that he did if he sit
[2:21:13] on 16 cylinders so
[2:21:15] will the bride
[2:21:18] amen for he said in john 14 12 he that
[2:21:22] believeth on me the works that i do
[2:21:26] shall he do also
[2:21:28] i'll give him a charge
[2:21:30] of my dynamics in his mechanics
[2:21:36] i'll give him a charge
[2:21:38] of my dynamics and his mechanics
[2:21:42] amen i got my body under subjected now
[2:21:45] i'm going to get a charge
[2:21:47] that the
[2:21:48] world will not be able to withstand it
[2:21:51] and i'll raise him up again in the last
[2:21:54] day that's the easter message that's the
[2:21:57] dynamics and the mechanics together the
[2:22:00] mechanics without the dynamics no good
[2:22:04] neither is the dynamics without
[2:22:07] the mechanics
[2:22:11] it only
[2:22:12] works
[2:22:13] as they come together
[2:22:15] amen
[2:22:16] so one will set still and the other one
[2:22:19] will go up
[2:22:20] that's the only thing
[2:22:22] there is to it
[2:22:24] yet they both might look alike
[2:22:26] both claim to be churches
[2:22:29] both claim to be bride but one has the
[2:22:32] mechanics and the dynamics it brings it
[2:22:36] to pass
[2:22:37] of what he said
[2:22:40] is
[2:22:41] truth
[2:22:44] and
[2:22:45] and you can read 114 for yourself
[2:22:48] they'll put it up on the board you can
[2:22:49] read it people think i'm against
[2:22:51] shouting and jumping but i don't believe
[2:22:53] you should shout or jump
[2:22:55] any higher than you live
[2:22:58] and then it settles this here this is
[2:23:00] the spark
[2:23:02] in 117 you can do nothing without me
[2:23:06] but with me
[2:23:08] you can do all things
[2:23:10] and he is the word
[2:23:12] you can't do it without the word
[2:23:16] he is the power
[2:23:18] in the word
[2:23:20] so if you're going to lay hands on sick
[2:23:23] on somebody
[2:23:24] you don't have to worry about do i have
[2:23:27] the power you have the word
[2:23:30] the word told me to lay hands on the
[2:23:32] sick and they shall recover
[2:23:36] if they believe and you lay hands on the
[2:23:38] sick they know that you're doing the
[2:23:40] word so they know they're not looking
[2:23:42] for your power they're not looking for
[2:23:45] your faith
[2:23:47] they understand that this is the word
[2:23:52] this is what's coming to me
[2:23:54] it's the word that's coming to me
[2:23:58] this this is what i'm doing i've
[2:24:01] confessed my sins i've come up i'm being
[2:24:03] prayed for it it's not the preacher's
[2:24:06] god of power the preacher the power
[2:24:09] is god sparking
[2:24:12] the
[2:24:14] mechanic word
[2:24:16] to make it manifest
[2:24:18] so when we tend to say you don't go
[2:24:20] somewhere
[2:24:22] and
[2:24:23] with with an idea or trying to convince
[2:24:26] an idea you speak the word
[2:24:30] he's the power of that word
[2:24:33] that takes that word and breaks it to
[2:24:36] the person you're talking to
[2:24:39] in other words you've got to understand
[2:24:41] and understand that he's not afar off
[2:24:44] he's here he's with us he's in us
[2:24:48] you understand it is him
[2:24:51] bringing life
[2:24:53] to the mechanics that you've been
[2:24:55] obedient to
[2:24:58] now he's joining the two together so
[2:25:00] that he can spark it and move it down
[2:25:03] the road
[2:25:05] he doesn't want you to drive something
[2:25:07] down the road that doesn't identify him
[2:25:10] he doesn't want you living a life
[2:25:13] that doesn't identify him
[2:25:16] he can't spark that
[2:25:19] but if you get the mechanics right
[2:25:21] you apply the token you're doing the
[2:25:24] best you can you don't have to be
[2:25:26] perfect
[2:25:27] but if you if people know in your life
[2:25:29] i'm doing the best i can i'm trying to
[2:25:32] overcome i'm trying to live i believe
[2:25:34] god's working with me i believe that
[2:25:36] gospel testifies god will testify to
[2:25:39] that
[2:25:40] that's the word
[2:25:42] and he manifests the word
[2:25:46] that's your weapon
[2:25:48] that's our life
[2:25:51] what was waved over us was the word of
[2:25:53] god that's why they rejected the word
[2:25:58] they didn't reject brother random
[2:26:02] they rejected him
[2:26:04] because he was the word
[2:26:06] they looked at his plan
[2:26:09] and said
[2:26:10] no
[2:26:11] we don't need it your way
[2:26:13] we'll find our own way and they'll never
[2:26:17] come to pure
[2:26:19] bride
[2:26:20] life
[2:26:23] they'll never be this living word
[2:26:26] because they rejected
[2:26:28] the only thing
[2:26:30] that can spark this to life
[2:26:33] and so
[2:26:34] it it's beautiful i guess now this is
[2:26:36] good a place
[2:26:39] to close
[2:26:40] but you can do nothing without me
[2:26:43] but with me you can do all things
[2:26:46] as
[2:26:47] as he is the word
[2:26:50] is the father living
[2:26:53] father sent me so i send you
[2:26:57] as the father
[2:26:59] has fired me
[2:27:01] and push me
[2:27:02] into everything
[2:27:04] i do only
[2:27:05] that which is pleasing to god
[2:27:09] now as he sends me so i send you
[2:27:13] with the same mechanics and it takes the
[2:27:17] same dynamics to operate it
[2:27:20] all these signs shall follow them
[2:27:22] that claim to have the mechanics the
[2:27:25] dynamics will
[2:27:27] take place
[2:27:28] and don't
[2:27:31] misunderstand that
[2:27:33] in other words him pushing you
[2:27:36] is not like pushing you it's like
[2:27:38] leading you
[2:27:42] that unction is a push from the inside
[2:27:47] that little something
[2:27:48] that takes place
[2:27:50] on the inside that leadership
[2:27:52] to take what you know is the word of god
[2:27:57] and turn it from mechanics
[2:27:59] to dynamics amen i just hope you enjoyed
[2:28:02] the message this morning
[2:28:04] and and so we'll tonight we'll just pick
[2:28:07] up and it's 15 minutes long tonight
[2:28:11] and just fellowship
[2:28:13] and then
[2:28:15] after tonight i'm going to go out in
[2:28:20] at my mom's house so i can rest for a
[2:28:22] couple weeks to
[2:28:24] get ready for the meetings i'm not
[2:28:27] supposed to think
[2:28:30] you know all my life they've been saying
[2:28:31] what have you been thinking
[2:28:33] or don't you think
[2:28:35] before you act you know now they're
[2:28:37] telling me don't think so i don't know
[2:28:40] how to do that i wasn't supposed to
[2:28:42] preach for three weeks but i told that
[2:28:44] ain't happening
[2:28:45] because that's the only time i really
[2:28:47] feel good
[2:28:49] but uh so we'll cut we'll get to the
[2:28:51] halfway through the message tonight
[2:28:54] we're only halfway through
[2:28:57] i mean have you seen all the things that
[2:28:58] have just poured out
[2:29:01] and and tonight he's going to talk about
[2:29:04] the same spirit
[2:29:07] i'm sorry i have to it i'm so excited
[2:29:10] about it
[2:29:11] but the same spirit that brought your
[2:29:14] seed to life
[2:29:16] and gave you the revelation of jesus and
[2:29:19] changed your nature
[2:29:24] now that same spirit can come into your
[2:29:26] life
[2:29:27] and rule
[2:29:29] your flesh
[2:29:31] so those temptations don't have any
[2:29:34] power over you
[2:29:36] and that's where a lot of us are weak
[2:29:40] he can just get there and get us
[2:29:42] we pop off we watch things lust rules
[2:29:46] over us but praise god
[2:29:48] he's showing us that the same thing
[2:29:52] that made us believe
[2:29:54] is the same quickening power that can
[2:29:57] take this flesh and take all the gossip
[2:29:59] out wouldn't all you sisters like to be
[2:30:01] free from all that gossip
[2:30:04] all that tongue waggling you do
[2:30:08] all that talking about the sisters and
[2:30:10] all their life and all the stuff that's
[2:30:13] going on
[2:30:14] don't you want to get that all oh i know
[2:30:16] who you are
[2:30:18] would you like to get that old unruly
[2:30:20] member just locked down
[2:30:23] we're bitter and sweet don't come out of
[2:30:25] the same
[2:30:28] you know what that takes
[2:30:30] takes quickening power
[2:30:34] you don't take willpower
[2:30:36] you've got no control it's a hard thing
[2:30:39] to rule it takes god
[2:30:42] it takes the same spirit that brought
[2:30:45] the word seed to life in you to now
[2:30:48] overflow and bring this body
[2:30:52] under subjection
[2:30:54] and you say well that sounds simple no
[2:30:57] after 50 years i'm starting startling
[2:30:59] finally to understand
[2:31:02] that
[2:31:03] my health
[2:31:05] wasn't in the mechanics
[2:31:11] i tried to bring it under subjection by
[2:31:14] mechanics
[2:31:16] but it's not it's brought under
[2:31:17] subjection by dynamics may god bless you
[2:31:21] brother billy will lead us to worship
[2:31:22] let's stand together
[2:31:28] it does anybody have we don't have room
[2:31:30] for
[2:31:31] a altar call or
[2:31:33] or anything but
[2:31:35] this morning
[2:31:37] just
[2:31:38] looking at
[2:31:40] your own life and knowing what your own
[2:31:42] struggles are
[2:31:44] the scripture says he
[2:31:47] knows what you have need of even before
[2:31:49] you ask
[2:31:50] i know we have
[2:31:52] those amongst us that are
[2:31:54] battling sicknesses and
[2:31:57] the world might call them diseases or
[2:32:00] whatever
[2:32:01] but it doesn't matter
[2:32:03] because we know that god has the power
[2:32:07] to make a change and whatever we have to
[2:32:11] do to get in position
[2:32:14] to take the place that's promised to us
[2:32:18] and when we move into that place that's
[2:32:20] promised to us
[2:32:23] god then can wave that sheaf over us
[2:32:27] and spark that gasoline that's in us to
[2:32:31] make that word move
[2:32:33] i hope
[2:32:34] that i can explain that to you so you've
[2:32:36] got the gas in you you've got the word
[2:32:39] if you're in position
[2:32:42] then
[2:32:42] all you need is for god to spark that
[2:32:45] faith
[2:32:47] and when that faith is sparked it'll
[2:32:50] move
[2:32:51] the mechanics it'll move you into that
[2:32:55] place
[2:32:56] and so brother john i know many of you
[2:32:58] don't know
[2:33:00] brother john marar very well and sister
[2:33:02] gladys but he is one of the most lovely
[2:33:05] men
[2:33:06] you'll ever meet
[2:33:08] humble
[2:33:10] i went to visit him at his house and
[2:33:13] you thought the president of the united
[2:33:15] states had come
[2:33:16] [Music]
[2:33:18] you know
[2:33:19] and for the whole time they just talked
[2:33:21] about how glad they were and to see me
[2:33:24] and what an honor it was and just humble
[2:33:26] tries to make a disservice every time
[2:33:28] he's got
[2:33:30] and he sent a text he said you know
[2:33:33] the doctors told me they can't do
[2:33:35] nothing the hospital told me they can't
[2:33:37] do nothing medicine said they can't do
[2:33:39] nothing
[2:33:42] they say here's what we'll do
[2:33:44] we'll send you home
[2:33:47] we'll give you a bunch of drugs
[2:33:51] so you don't feel a thing
[2:33:54] and you can die
[2:33:58] i believe there's another option
[2:34:02] and you say where is that option brother
[2:34:04] mcgarry it's right here
[2:34:07] ask anything of my father
[2:34:10] and don't doubt in your heart
[2:34:14] and sometimes our heart condemns us
[2:34:17] because our mechanics aren't right
[2:34:20] but what happens when your mechanics
[2:34:22] aren't right
[2:34:24] you take it to a
[2:34:26] mechanic
[2:34:28] right
[2:34:29] how about taking your mechanics to jesus
[2:34:35] the same spirit that gave you the
[2:34:37] revelation of him
[2:34:39] is the same spirit that convicts your
[2:34:41] flesh
[2:34:42] and your mechanic
[2:34:44] and the more we start applying the token
[2:34:47] the more we start bringing our mechanics
[2:34:50] into
[2:34:51] obedience the more we all get together
[2:34:54] on the same page
[2:34:56] i thought brother mike's exhortation
[2:34:59] this morning
[2:35:01] was
[2:35:02] so beautiful
[2:35:04] i was going to stick my head out the
[2:35:05] door and say amen
[2:35:09] when we bring
[2:35:11] our lives all of our lives
[2:35:14] not having a spiritual life and a
[2:35:16] physical life
[2:35:19] but when those two can come together as
[2:35:21] one
[2:35:23] and i know we got our spiritual life
[2:35:25] right you've been taught it's our
[2:35:27] mechanics that's
[2:35:30] a little rough
[2:35:31] so we need the power of god to come and
[2:35:33] work our mechanics and give us a tune-up
[2:35:37] if so if you have that this morning just
[2:35:40] ask him to come by and
[2:35:42] help you with those things that you have
[2:35:46] some people it's alcohol some people
[2:35:48] it's cigarettes some people it's sports
[2:35:51] there's all kinds of things that satan
[2:35:53] tries to gain power with us
[2:35:56] and all things are lawful but all things
[2:35:59] aren't expedient
[2:36:00] and we must do all things in moderation
[2:36:04] but sin is not
[2:36:06] anything you can do in moderation
[2:36:08] because it's death
[2:36:10] but let's keep brother john in
[2:36:12] prayer that
[2:36:15] that he could have a miracle in his life
[2:36:18] that the god he served and loved
[2:36:22] and praises
[2:36:24] will reach down and touch his wife
[2:36:27] the others that are sick and
[2:36:31] you know if you made a mistake then
[2:36:35] you just put it under the blood
[2:36:37] he's
[2:36:38] righteous and
[2:36:40] faithful to forgive you
[2:36:43] he doesn't want you to fail
[2:36:46] he wants you to live and
[2:36:48] with peace and joy unspeakable
[2:36:53] and full of glory
[2:36:55] he wants you to have a peace that
[2:36:57] passes understanding i don't know why
[2:37:00] i'm so peaceful with all that i've done
[2:37:03] because he came by
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:07] so if you'd have something on your heart
[2:37:09] someone on your heart
[2:37:11] if you have a desire to draw closer to
[2:37:13] god than you've ever been before
[2:37:18] i'm not preaching at you this morning
[2:37:21] i'm standing here with you
[2:37:25] i want
[2:37:27] my flesh
[2:37:29] and my spirit
[2:37:31] to come together as one
[2:37:35] i hope you can
[2:37:37] show that to us tonight lord
[2:37:42] you know the needs of each heart
[2:37:44] i ask that your holy spirit would
[2:37:47] go by
[2:37:49] that the word would go by and
[2:37:51] you'd speak to their heart
[2:37:54] and father they'd forget their mind and
[2:37:58] just look what's
[2:38:00] down inside
[2:38:03] and i believe if they look down inside
[2:38:05] they will know that they really love you
[2:38:09] though they may be ashamed of so many
[2:38:12] things
[2:38:13] yet they love you lord
[2:38:16] and most important you love them
[2:38:20] and lord that's all you want to do is
[2:38:22] clear the air
[2:38:25] remove any petition that's between us
[2:38:31] lord in my heart's desires to draw
[2:38:33] closer to you
[2:38:38] lord how i feel like i've wasted so many
[2:38:41] years
[2:38:46] lord how i've battled my flesh the wrong
[2:38:48] way

[2:38:51] [Music]
[2:38:53] and you've been there all the time to
[2:38:55] touch it
[2:38:57] and to heal it
[2:39:00] and to give me the power to
[2:39:05] conform it into the image of
[2:39:08] your word
[2:39:10] and lord i want to turn my struggle into
