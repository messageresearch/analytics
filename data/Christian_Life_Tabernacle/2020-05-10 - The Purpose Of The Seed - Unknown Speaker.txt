be gathering the house of God let's just open our Bibles in first John chapter 3 you're gonna read from verse 1 until 10 says first John chapter 3 they says beloved what manner of love the father had be stored upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because he knew him not it says beloved now we are the sons of God not in some future time but he's very expressly saying now we are the sons of God and and do it not appear what we shall be but we know that when we shall appear when he shall appear we shall be like unto him like him for we shall see him as he is in other word in the in the greater revelation of who he is when he when he unfolds himself to be known for who he really is it says then at the same time we also are coming to a greater understanding of really who we really are it says and every man that had this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure whatsoever come whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also of the law for sin is in the transgression of the law and ye and says and ye know that he is not manifested to take away our sin and you know that he is that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abideth in him seeing it not whosoever sinneth had known had not seen him neither know anything no no yes little children let not let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous and he and as he is righteous and he that he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the sons of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for the seed of God remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God he in this is the children of God are manifested that the children of the devil will so ever do it not not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother let's just bar heads gracious Father we thank you for your grace and we thank you for your mercy we are here gathering in your presence Lord we ask that you speak to us we commit everything we are to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats it's good to be gather in the house of God amen probably gonna do something tonight that I never done before I thought of just giving you the title and then preaching it next time it is this there was so much just flooding in my mind this afternoon that I just didn't know what direction to go and and I trust I'll just be able to say a few words to help us kind of see this is and and and and the desire is to basically tie it with what was said this morning but it's just a greater understanding within my heart that I just want to bring out tonight and obviously would just rather lay the foundation so we can pick it up this time didn't this morning as we were listening to the message what house will that build me there was just you know just the way brother Brennan was saying things he just came to my heart and and they touched me so greatly before we can jump on out just would like to go back to some of those things he was saying he had come here he is reading the scripture and and he's now talking about how that he you know our pastor mention it that he there was no open doors for him it couldn't go no invitation for him to go preach and and here he is and he's talking about how that Moses was sent Moses writing the the Old Testament he talked about he talks about how that he was led in the wilderness because he said that the place that he was he didn't go by himself he was led to go there to go to Arizona so basically he's laying the same foundation and he also speaks and he says that you know when Moses in his time when it came time to write the Bible he says that he was also led to go in the wilderness it's fixed he says but that was the foundation of the Old Testament was Moses when he wrote when he says when he wrote them after he was called from his homeland where he had been born he was brought up to his people and he was sent in a desert to write the book of the Old Testament and then he from then on he talks about how Paul was also sent to the desert to a place where it was just by himself in he talks about how he was in the Arabia desert for him to go in and and to write the New Testament and then he picks up after that he now drops down to the seals and I know we heard that this morning and there's a purpose why I just want to pick up on some of some of these things so we can go on and and so he says and now if if the Old Testament had to be had had to be drove written they had been drove from the people into the wilderness to get an inspiration to write the Old Testament and in the New Testament to write what the writer was drove rather by the author into the desert place to get the inspiration to write the New Testament it says and the and and and and the book are sealed with seven seals it would it would require the same I believe in these days to open those seven seals to leave what your whole dear - what - what you cherish the little home that was given that was given me by my people among all my people and my friends and the church that was that was flourishing and nothing lacking to leave to pull right away from it and move away into a desert where you knew nobody and everything against you so I want you to just see how he's speaking about the things that he had to endure in order for him to bring us those seven seals mystery that was revealed to us I want you to see how his typing what Moses went through typing it with what Paul had to go through typing it without his own ministry and and as you read further on he he begins to speak as he's dedicating if in the very church as it speaking about the the very church here he began to - to say how that you know he says this this place it says I can instead of drying driving back to Jeffersonville I could just come here every time the Lord gives me a message it delivered it said I believe the brother believes just exactly as I believe it and all those things now he begin and and and if you read it the more you read it you begin to realize that he's establishing that this is not something the same as the denomination obviously you think about the earlier stage of his ministry he reached on those churches and there was great healing campaign and people saving people although most of the tapes we have and you hear the shouting and the congregation just up and and all the miracles and all those things that were happening but to realize that they came to a time where all of that was going away but it was nothing no one was there for the message anymore they all were in when there was time for miracles for signs and for all of that and but when he came down to the real identification with the word there was only very few left and and I began to wonder even how he began to think about his own ministry how did you know perhaps he thought that it would be something greater than what it was at that time and and that all the churches will come together because he tried to stand in the gap time after time again and and he he purposely didn't belong to any organization because he wanted to bring everybody together but yet it was at the very end with just that little building open a place where he can come and preach and and all those things but yet God in that very time it was establishing his bride if I could say God at that very time he was establishing another group of people that will come from the seed that was sown that will come and I couldn't I mean I was even say tonight to envision what the message has become today and the body of the believers and all those things and and how that they've grown throughout the years to get to the place where we are today you realize that the work has been going on even though the messenger was gone the very food that he stole continued the work of God now you just to hold on to that I I just want to speak for a little bit about the purpose of the seed the purpose of the seed now we as reread this morning as we we heard that this morning he talked about what kind of building are you going to build and and and so I want to take you just away from the physical building structure and perhaps use the analogy of the seed so we can move forward now we we realize that the Word of God is a seed the Prophet tells us that the the spoken word is the very original seed everything that came outside of the spoken see this the enemy seed that everything that God spoke is what's the original seed and we realize that it's the it's the Word of God when we see an apple tree bringing Apple when we see an orange tree bring oranges is because the very original seed was the Word of God it's not because the orange restore original said it's because that's what the Word of God said the seed will do and so we begin to look at that and we realize even as we sit here that there's been a seed of God planted within within the people of God that's what attracted that's what when we heard the Word of God that's why we were attracted because there was a seed planted and we realized that God when he's focused what it was a seed that went forth and it was planted in and when it came time even as momentum laid it out throughout the ages you begin to realize that in the first stage there was a seed that was sown there was a seed a bright seed that was sown out throughout the years and God will send messengers forth they will come and speak a word that would cause the seed to come forth in other words that will bring the seed out of what it was into the manifestation and and we realized that the seed itself became the very identification of the children of God I was sitting at home and I was thinking about how you know not that when we were born the the flesh was our identification we identified with our parents where we came from the food we ate our culture and all those things that's the only thing we knew and then we heard the Word of God then something out of the ordinary something within our hearts began to respond to the Word of God it didn't matter how contrary was to the flesh it didn't matter how contrary was to our understanding but a man will speak these things that this type of things will happen but yet there was something within our hearts that identified what was spoken something I can even say almost like the boy the program talks about that was looking in the mirror or heard something and there was something within their hearts that wanted to be what they saw in the mirror and so that was the seed became my identification we began to deny our own flesh and we begin to deny our own desires why because the seed was calling now I just want to stop there for a moment and walk well we'll get back to that when we when we speak about the seed when we speak about the very definition of a seed the seed is speaks about a part that we just see if I can find it here when we speak about a seed is the part and I thought the definition was so feeling with what was on my mind it says a seed is a part of a seed plant which can grow into a new plant the seed is part of the seed plant that can grow into a new plant there's other parts of the plant that cannot grow you cannot take the leaves and go and bury their leaves and expect to get anything out of it you cannot take a branch and go and bury it and expect to get anything out of it in the tree there's a specific element there's a specific part of the plant that is called the seed within it it has the ability to reproduce the tree again now I want you to think about what was said in this morning what house are we building I want to say this when God planted his seed it was the purpose that that that seed will produce another God the seed was not planted so he could produce denomination the seed was not planted so he can produce intellect the seed was not planned trying to produce understanding the seed went into the ground so he could produce another God in fact if scripture says us unless the seed is barri into the ground then he stays alone but when he's buried is for the purpose of producing much fruit like the see that went into the ground so if we can look at ourselves this morning and ask what is the purpose of the seed that God planted within us what is the purpose of that seed it's not to produce so to have a better life here on earth and and to try to do great things and to be appreciated by people now the purpose of the seed is to produce what God intended for that seemed to be so we realized that's why the seed became our identification often time you know because we realize we were the seed was put in the flesh it was putting this into this body and within this body we know that we have a fleshly identification with the fleshly identification that's what the enemy uses and often time we have to fight it at all time because what the seed is looking for and what the flesh is looking for it's too contrary things it brings us into a battle where we constantly have to fight the flesh in order to produce what the CDs intended to produce but when I'm says in the message I know my Redeemer liveth he says I said he says we will take for instance he speaks about nowhere he says we'll take for instance no way in the Bible there was a great flood that came on and all dears was destroyed the vegetation was destroyed the vegetation and everything was destroyed but Noah and his seed had not taken he had not taken and had had he taken into the ark it says God's purpose can never be defeated there's nothing can defeat it so how happy we ought to be today resting upon that beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither things present nor things to come no sickness no sorrow no death no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God now I want you to realize how the Prophet takes the scripture and interprets it because scripture says nothing can separate that from the love of God which is in Jesus Christ and now he takes it it says that love of God is the very purpose of God being manifested it's a very hot purpose of God in another place it says you take what God taught of this mind and you take what he had in his heart to do in other word he's giving the very description that is giving God as one having something in his mind and one having purpose within his heart and he says and when he's done those who think nothing can stop it and I'm talking about the seed of God the seed and the purpose and the intention of God to produce and as a race like himself you know often time I'm always it took me a while I would read and you would read in the news in the book of Genesis and it will talk about how a seed had to go according to his own kind and his own kind and his own kind and you ask yourself for what purpose and then you realize you come to the realization that God was protecting his own seed it was not so much for the plant in the trees and the oranges and the apple the purpose was God knew that he was going to have a seed that the seed will have to come and produce what he intended otherwise the devil was going to corrupt it so he says that a seed is the part of the seed plant that can grow into another plant it is the reproductive structure which disperses one it could survive for time it could survive for some time a typical seed include three basic parts the embryo a supply of nutrients for the embryo and the seed coat which is the very protective element on the outside so we can come here tonight and and and realize that the seed that God planted within us it was a way for God to bring us into the manifestation of what he desired and therefore he planted a seed within us and there's three main purposes of the seed that I would like to touch tonight and like I said I'll just go just laid the foundation perhaps we'll go we'll come back to these things one of them are just talking about is through the the seed is what identifies what brings identification to us because outside of the seed all we are is whatever the flesh has told us we were its whatever our parents has told us we wear when we grew up is whatever the schoolteacher told us we wear when we went to school is whatever the sport our coaches and everybody that we met a long life way whatever a talent or whatever they discover within us that's what we become that's all but we realize that regardless of what the world can tell us we are they something within us that identifies who we really are and that's the seed of God so it was given through us for identification so we may come to a place with the understanding of who God intends us to be and how we should serve it and then the second important element we we need to understand that with every seed the environment or the place the condition that the seed is put in is very important the scripture speaks if we can turn in Matthew chapter 13 it's a very familiar scripture reading the parable of the sower it says it says the same day when Jesus the same day went Jesus out of from the house and he set on the seaside and a great multitude were gathered together unto him so that he went into the ship and said and a whole multitude stood there on the shore and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold the soul went forth to soul it says when he sought some seed fell on the way side and the fowls came and devoured devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and and forthwith and then he says there sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the Sun was up there was there was court and because they had not they had not root they withered away and some fell among the tones and the tones sprung up and choked them but because it says another fell upon the good ground and brought forth fruits some a hundredfold some sixtyfold and some thirtyfold he says who has an who has who has an ear let him hear and he says and the disciple came and said unto him why speak adapt in parrot to them in parable and he answered and said unto because it's given unto you to know the mystery of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whatsoever for whatsoever head to him shall be given and he shall have more and he shall have more abundance but whosoever he had not from him shall be taken away even that that he had therefore speak I to them in parable because they day seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people heart is what's gross and the ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time that they should see with a week they should see with their eyes and hear with the ears and they shall understand with the ears and they shall be converted and I should heal them but blessed are you are your eyes for they see and do here and your ears for the ear for the here for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them so here he is speaking to them bringing them to the place where and we realized later in the chapter he gives them the very definition of what he was talking about when he when he comes and he explains the parable but we realized that the scripture is very expressly telling us that there in the purpose of the seed that the seed had to be placed in the right kind of ground so that he may grow that this seed had to be taken and and and it wasn't and I want to say this the seed was not just planted and and and walked away from that the seed will do everything by itself the seed was given and planted that someone may take care of it that you may water it that he may work the ground and remove all the tones and everything so that the seed may actually be built up come to the place where it would produce fruits because there's no purpose of planting the seed unless there's a desire to see a tree and the fruits of it so if the seed is our identification if the seed I tell you there's so many times as a even a secretion there's so many times we find ourselves you know do all kinds of things and you realize I can't believe I did this so I went there or I should have done this and this and the seed was what was picking you up from the dust and any way you will go and and get to a place where you realize I just I'm just a miserable failure this he tells you you get up and you continue walking it was the seed of God talking to you the seed came in and when we find ourselves desperate and we didn't know which was in and out or we thought we believed and yet everything is crumbling it we thought we understood but yet on descending was little the seed was there to keep you up when we don't understand the seed is there to give us the faith that we need in order for us to walk and so we realized that was God building his kids is his tree you know but a random talks about the restoration of the bride tree that was God building his stream he started off with the seed he knew that there was a seed that I planted in the last time I planted in the LA sage that I will come again and I will come and I will speak my word through the sieve and sin will become a mighty tree so so find out it's that seed that we protect its that seed that we water it's that seed that we do we bring into the presence of the Sun and we let the Sun warm it out the warm up the crown that we wanted to grow and to grow why why because in doing so the seed is growing out of the seed is the tree expected to come forth so we realize that becomes a very important element but when I'm continues on in the message no it's not he continues on he says then we find out that in in we find out that in that day that all he says we find out that in that day that all the world was going on to be destroyed he continued to speak about Noah was going to be destroyed by the flood that God made he says with another God made a preparation in preparation for what cause he says to preserve his purpose he did it in the day of Noah he's doing it today he may he has made a preparation to conserve to conserve to his own purpose he will conserve he will conserve the church he will conserve the church he will conserve the people he'll conserve the subject of his great domain that death cannot destroy them so so here he is it what is the preparation that was made what is the preparation of the conservation that was made God Himself gave His Word to the product the age he gave his word to the people so that when they would receive that word the seed that was planted within them will be preserved the preparation of the preservation of the seed is in the Word of God is within the promise of the age that God has said so that when the seed receives that word is no way to be destroyed why because the word is there to preserve the seed he says and we realize that it is by faith that we'll believe this but the resurrection produces a solid foundation on which our faith rest nothing can destroy it as the poet once wrote he says oh what a foretaste of glory divine error salvation purchase of God born of his spirit washed in his blood what an assurance upon this solid rock the resurrection is a blessed love our blessed lover the Lord Jesus it says nothing can destroy it it has been planted it is the seed of God it is the purpose of God to give us blessed Holy Spirit it is the purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and miracle it's the purpose of God and nothing can destroy it all powers of Hell might wage might wage against it but it will not prevail it says we have God's eternal promise there may be teachers and there may be isms rise they may be great program rise there may be things that look like it would destroy it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it's the purpose of God to see that it will prevail so here he is is is giving us the complete understanding of what he's trying to achieve with the planting of the seed it is purpose to make sure that that scene will produce just like he promised in the beginning that cities there to carry you through and to protect and to speak when you can't speak it to tell you what to do when you don't know what to do it's the heartbeat that we have within us it's a very thing that kept us alive but we find out that he wants us to make sure that we put it into a ground that we preserve the ground and now we keep the sunlight coming why because the purpose of the scene is not to stay a seed but it's to produce a tree and the fruits of it so he says in the message what visions are he speaks it says see what it is you must know how to approach you must know what diseases are he says I adventure to say that less you be a lesser he it's be a doctor he says the one percent of the people here would actually know what cancer consists of it's a tumor it's a cataract what tuberculosis he says what a journey is how that he would come and be brought here he said where it's cut where it comes from life all those things it says the strange thing is in many times doctors don't know they know the growth is there but what causes it it's got to have a reason it's got to be it's got to be there for some cause and it's a life it's not your life it's another life that came into you it's another cell a developing cell a multiplication of self that's what you are it says that's what a Germans a cancer a tumor cataract or any germ it says it's in you for one purpose its it says it's a death in your mortal flesh now I want you to realize he's tying the purpose of the germs being there to the very purpose of what it's me it's there for so it's there for it to cause death its death in your mortal flesh and a cancer sucking your blood killing you it's the growth it it has no form it takes the firm from the natural from the nature of your father it says or of anything like like its kind it says every seed will will will every seed after its kind if you are a human seed if you are if you are a seed of a human being it will produce a human being a seed from a dog will produce a dog it says o11 that comes from the seed of the woman it says and the devil had fought and he had seen that he had fought to destroy that right see that Calvary and let's just stand here for a moment and watch something that takes place what display could you ever imagine of an omni pod on upon him omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient infinite God ever letting the devil DVD its purpose it said not not God he will never do it it says when he took when he took at his family in the Garden of Eden when the little Adam and Eve her lovely little head laying on Adams shoulder has he moved through the garden and if the winds blow Eve will say out he said Adam let it be peace and the wind will stop and the lion and the tiger will follow them that was Kidal it says and in the evening when the Sun was going down and it went to the cathedral and the palm trees all or whatever tree it was in the Eden day being there to worship a soft mellow light it says a soft mellow light God the logos came down over the top of the tree and he says children have you enjoyed yourself today on the earth and I have to come down to kiss you good-bye and lay them to sleep lay them down asleep and lay all the animal town to rest the night it says the father said that's good I like the way it was done so yes but when I'm laying the very foundation of what God imagined and wanted to achieve and how that he designed his own Eden and how it was in the condition under which it was and he's saying that every purpose of God he's tied to the restoration of whether that was in Eden that we just read about that everything all his motives and objectives and everything that he began to do after the fall was for the restoration of what this relationship with this relationship was in the Garden of Eden when he when he he thought about the seed of the woman bruising the Serpent's head and when he thought about adamant and and he talked about Moses coming in about Jesus Christ died on the cross all of that was the seed of God coming forth to the manifestation for what purpose for the restoration of what was in Eden for the restoration of bringing us back into that same relationship that we had with him in before but the difference was this was going to be a greater relationship why because had come into a place where he made himself known and he had this many attribute to manifest to his people but in receiving those manifestation though it was those manifestation will drive us back into a relationship greater than what was seen in the Garden of Eden God planted his seed so that the seed may produce himself I'll say this the main purpose of any seed is to reproduce the parents plant the purpose of any seed is to reproduce the parent plant if if a seed was taken off an orange the the the best that that seed could do the very capstone of that seed can produce is to come right back into a tree like way was taken from and I'll say this our lives will mean nothing unless we can come to a place where we can fully Express what God intended for us to express unless we can come to a place where we can reflect a nothing but God himself just like it was in the beginning he says when the infinite God who saved you here knowing that it's going to lose you next week or next month or next year he says why he says it will defeat his very purpose very purpose he can't lose you he can't he says he can't lose you he that heareth my word and believe in him that sent me has everlasting life and shall never come into judgment but is done passed from death unto life can't do it it says he'll do no more he was born of God he that is born of God does not commit sin for the City of God remaineth in him he cannot sin how can you sin when sin when this when there's no when does scene offering for him how can he be sick when there's perfect health how can he be blind why can he be blind when I can see oh my how can I be in the building and out of the building at the same time it says how can I be drunk and sober at the same time how can it be oh it says when you are safe you are under the Atonement your sins are written unto you you are not written unto you so here he is and that's why we even wear it with what our pastor was saying this morning we recognize the importance of the seed we realized that it was that what God has planted for the purpose of bringing us back because he didn't care about what flesh not so much about what flesh the seed was in because even predestinated the flesh but he knew that there was a seed within the flesh and he knew what that seed was going to produce therefore when he laid a seed it's up to us to continually lay that seed in the presence of the Sun you know you you think about what this shutdown is done and and often time if you're not careful people get stuck into the routine because everybody wanted to be out so much you come to the realization that you know when life is like he is all we do is just go with the flow and you know we go to our jobs and we come back and this this to do and they start to do and there is everything where the this perhaps was something that God wanted to attract our attention but if we're not careful we felt like a get into the routine well you know now it's head down we're just going to do this we develop a new routine that we're going to do so we can get by and every time something stopped well we find another way to go not just stopping for a moment and asking God there's the seed what's in here now we just read here brother Branham says that they said such an hunger within my heart to see the spirit moving it's in such a hunger within my heart to see God manifested that such a not this after the seal it's still hunger and then you would say well that was the very cup stone what would it hunger for why because as long as we are in this flesh there's a manifestation of God to be had it's it's it's the devil is not concerned about all the claims we can put on ourselves you know I was I was so Marvel you know I was with but of Matthew I believe on Friday Oh Saturday I can't remember right now we stopped at his place and and so there was this little clip that I was shown and I went home and I and I watch it was basically I believe it's um just a little mini series about Jesus and I just captivated in my mind it's just one particular scene that really caught me and this is when they came in they lured the paralyzed man into the room where Jesus was because there was no room to enter everywhere was blocked in and so the Pharisees came at the window and they began to question him who are you what students are you and what school do you go to and who gave you the authority to do this and we don't even recognize you but how by what power do you do all those things and so he looked at them and he seemed to have not paid attention and he looked and he looks at the blind the paralyzed man in this sense I say unto you that scenes are forgiven there and they were all in shock how can a man say these things only God can forgive sin and then after that he looks at it man and he says now I want you to stand up take that bed and walk he says which one is difficult to say that sins are forgiven thee or to say that take up thy bed and walk I'm telling I will live in a time where God is talking to us not just that the scene has been forgiven but it's going to you today to stand up and walk why because any man can say whatever they want any person can say what they want to say but this man who can come and say and God goes behind and it stands behind man and produces the word that he said that's what we have received it's not some man's understanding where Brussels can standard say if all I just said here is the Word of God if for everything I just told you is the truth then let him come and manifest what I just said and that's where we are standing on the manifested Word of God anything that all the churches as far as the claim we can lay all of him out Methodist Baptist and everything and everyone with their own kind but what it's most important it's the manifestation of God for the promise of that hour and you realize even in this in the house for enemies wanting to make it very clear that this is not a denomination that this is this is built upon the foundation of the opening of the seals this church that we're about to have here it's not we not restricted we don't say we believe this we don't believe that he just say he believes the same way that I believe why which is that God has revealed to us in this Las age he sent us a messenger and that's why we believe if the musician could come so he says did not have it said blessed is a man that God will not reckon sin or impurity sin God the hold sin against his creation he says that strong it isn't skim milk but it's the Bible God will not reckon sin against the righteous God by His grace through predestination not willing that any should perish but at all come into the repentance but being infinite know whom come and who can who cannot come but it could predestinate everything to work to his will if he didn't do it why did he permit the sin to come in the first place he was the savior if there would be no snot a sin he would have never been a savior the attribute within him could not be pulled out we here to pull out of his attribute we here to bring it down all of those that whatever we find ourselves in need of there is an attribute somewhere that we can pull down to otherwise it would not be there because the law of contrast will make sure that it's not there it's there because within God there's something that we can pull down so that it will be manifested let's all stand tonight [Music] so it's very important that we keep our focus on that on that fruit bearing tree and that we may look at ourselves regardless of where we find ourselves that we may focus on the fruit bearing tree and say that within me there's a seed that was planted but on my stool that I know to planted to water it and to do all that I can to kick the ground so that the sunlight may come and and this tree may grow and may grow and may come to a place where we will produce the fruit you know I was I was looking at this little clip I came across and I thought it was a wonderful and he was talking about the very cycle of life and and and and he was talking at a place it was talking about almost the journey of the seed and how that the seed is planted and it comes and he grows and it produces the fruits and the fruits are taken and it's taken and fed into the birds and the animals and all of those things and how the humans use the grains of it and all of this you realized that life exists itself because the the the the scene is doing what it was supposed to do I want you to just imagine for a second if every seed that was planted would not bring any fruits where would we be if every seed that was planted refused to bring forth of what it was planted for or it failed to come to the manifestation of it this world will not exist we will not have any food to eat or anything the reason why all of us in law is because every seed that was planted stuck to his purpose it did what it was supposed to do the water if they did and he grew and and and the seed itself has to die it has to remove of its protective and and come to a place where it died so life can come within itself [Music] let's just our heads gracious father was so thankful for your word know the hard purpose of every believers to manifest what you've called us loathe is the hunger that's the hunger of our heart and that's the very heartbeat that we haven't is always to look around and to check and do measuring to make sure that we're not being deceived by the enemy to make sure that we are not being caught up too much in the things of the world and that we'll make sure that we are not being laid aside too much and that our hearts and our desires always towards your Lord father we ask tonight Lord even as we desire for the manifestation you said that that bride will be the very manifestation it said that that shout it says the shout itself was the very word that went forth calling bringing forth the bride Lord we are being brought forth by you O God and we pray tonight Lord if we got distracted and looking side and deciding and getting caught up within the life itself Lord we pray tonight that you just focus our eyes one more time that we may look to you and come into the greater realization of what you're doing but because there's nothing more that we desire than to come into the manifestation we love you and we commit everything we are to you and ask those things in the name of Jesus Christ refrain hey mind him head let's just sing now [Music] you saw me in my knees you pay the price for me Loyola I have been set free whoo now I am not the same you took my sin and chain forever I will let your Holy Name oh and I adore I adore Lamb of God I [Music] you Jesus you vida to me I adore let's sing it against murder David comes oh you saw me in my me you pay the price for me and rely I have been set free now I am not the same you to my sin and shame for let's draw holy name whoa door you [Music] hey man I don't I don't use these but I mean that's just wonderful what we heard tonight you know I I just that statement just burned in my heart that the purpose of that seed is to reproduce the parent and you know it just it just struck me so much that you know bro gram said if God ever does anything he does it right the first time because if he didn't then that means he couldn't improve upon it and so when in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh it's okay if Jesus was the son of God and he was in God's thinking before the foundation of the world and he was part of God and God expressed him than any other son that God ever had had to come the same way it had to be identical so we had to be in his thinking and so we were in the beginning we were with God and we were the Word of God and we were a part of God and that word was made flesh I mean it's just so beautiful we call it seed we call it predestinated word we call it thought but the reason it's it's seed is because we saw that working in nature analogy it's just beautiful to think that we were with him in the beginning and just as Jesus came without sin so he could be a redeemer but yet that seed was in us and he redeemed that earth and oh it just it thrills my heart and I think that's our heart's desire is to really show the world the love of Jesus Christ shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit a real lead people with fruit of the Spirit the parent of the sons and daughters of God to produce the fruit of that parent which is the Spirit of God I that just makes me happy I know I got to go work on it amen I got to prune the tree I've got to water it and I've got to loosen the soil and I got a feed at the Word of God and and let it manifest to the glory of the one that I love amen Lord richly bless you I just want to let any of those that are might be watching there's plenty of room in the church house if you'd like to come out I hope you haven't got too comfortable on your couch and I certainly hope you haven't got to the place that you're eating popcorn and potato chips but that you're really entering in I know that some have had coffee and I can understand that but let's just put it in our hearts desire to get back together and things are starting to open up and we're going to start making adjustments accordingly and maybe let some of the lower risk people come a little closer together but so just bear with us but I hope everybody wants to come back or amen I talked to my mom this afternoon and she made me late to church but that was all right I wasn't get a stop talking to her you know and I thought I said mom I said if the Lord would take you home at 97 sure will be 98 in July I said it ain't no virus they took you home you know so you know I hate to see her live in fear the last times of her life you know I said that's not going to be what taking you and and and you know and I just said I said you're not going anywhere till I get a chance to see you again and that's just the way that I feel you know I I just I don't want to live in fear you know what I mean I want to live with like Billie said that purpose in me for that seed that God put there to bring forth the fruit and I don't want to do anything to stop that from doing that so I met really thrills my my heart amen I had a song I wanted to sing and I had the melody in my mind and I was I was trying to hum it all the way up here and then the minute I heard what you were playing it was gone and I think it goes something like this but he has a mind because you're gonna have to help me let's just seeing us on this a beautiful [Music] but you have sad [Music] as [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus [Music] until the day [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] that is great father but wonderful words we've heard tonight father the very purpose of the seed was to keep the species alive Oh father you created us and you're gonna keep us alive you gave us eternal life you made us eternal beings from the beginning that nothing could stop you from performing what you purposed in your heart we humbly and gratefully accept our part in your plan we know it was by the washing of the word and the revealing of your spirit father that were even conscious of the love that you have for us and father we ask that the love that you had for us that that love would be shed abroad in our hearts by your Holy Spirit when you prayed you you taught us to pray and you said for Father forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us that we might love as you loved us that we might walk the extra mile that we might give our clothes that we can be borrowed from and willingly give that that life that was manifested the seed that was so perfectly brought to resurrection life that's the tree that we're from that's the fruit that we're a part of that's the fruit that fell into our hearts that it can be reproduced as our brother so beautifully brought forth Lord now may that be our heart's desire maybe that's what we really want fathers to become little messiahs ambassadors of the kingdom reflectors of the power of the Resurrection Lord we need a lot of work done on us we have to die daily as Paul said I die daily that he might live and you might live in us father I know it's the desire of the hearts of the people father I ask in this hour that I may have a request as a pastor father that the joy bells might ring in the people's heart as you'd restore unto them the joy of their salvation and that this turbulent time that we're in will not rack us with fear that we will not be shaken but that the love of God would still reign and that the joy unspeakable full of glory would be our portion in this time other I just ask that you do that for each heart the mothers that are so faithfully at home watching their children we want to invite them back father make away our young children that haven't been in the house of the Lord father we pray that you would make away your the waymaker amen we asked you to grant it to us father as we're dismissed this evening north blessing heart here may they prosper and be in good health may their footsteps be ordered of you father may you lead them into green pastures and still waters may they live the rest of their days in peace and joy father may the burdens of life be set behind them and may they look up for the redemption draweth nanak we ask these things because you instructed us to call upon your name and we cry out your name lord grant these things I pray in Jesus precious name Amen god bless you go in peace shake hands from 6 feet away if you can reach you got long arms hey man god bless you loved one another you know you can show your love just by the smile on your face go in peace those of you at home we certainly invite you to come in fellowship with us we need you god bless each one of you go
