[39:33] that created thee o jacob that formed
[39:35] thee or israel filled nor for i have
[39:37] redeemed thee i have called thee
[39:40] by thy name thou art mine when that

[39:46] and through the rivers they shall
[39:48] overflow thee
[39:49] and when thou walkers through the fire
[39:52] that shall not be burned
[39:54] neither shall the flame candle upon thee

[39:57] of israel
[39:59] thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom
[40:01] ethiopian siva for thee

[40:15] you know actually two weeks from now i i
[40:18] went on a trip to go support one of my
[40:20] brother and just to take a break from
[40:22] the regular life and we went on a trip
[40:25] that saturday after we went to celebrate
[40:29] my brother getting my friend getting
[40:30] married
[40:31] and after the marriage so we stayed a
[40:33] little late just with the bros
[40:35] talking joking and it was like 1am we
[40:39] really got hungry it was just like okay
[40:40] let's go to the
[40:41] there was a taco truck somewhere in the
[40:43] woods we were just like okay let's go
[40:44] grab it
[40:45] since it was really far from any stores
[40:48] as we was driving we we grabbed the food
[40:52] we was just talking about life goals
[40:54] just i would be
[40:55] amongst bros just talking i'm doing this
[40:58] i want to do this and
[41:01] we was just driving every one of us that
[41:03] was sitting in the back seat
[41:04] of the car we didn't have no seat belt
[41:07] and just the people in the front
[41:09] the driver and the you know and my big
[41:11] brother
[41:12] they were on this front seat and we were
[41:14] just talking and we're going on a
[41:16] highway on a 65 mile per hour
[41:20] and as it was going you know there was a
[41:22] lady that came right in front of us
[41:24] she's just started driving and was just
[41:26] like all right school i mean we're
[41:27] chilling it's one am
[41:28] no rush we're gonna sleep maybe at three
[41:30] or four in the morning
[41:32] wake up and do the same thing the next
[41:34] day and stuff
[41:36] but as we kept on driving that lady came
[41:39] in front of us for a few minutes like a
[41:41] good two minutes or something
[41:42] was just talking and we didn't even pay
[41:44] attention to her we didn't care
[41:47] there was a car that a carpet saw is
[41:49] coming in on the opposite side
[41:51] at 65 also miles per hour
[41:55] the cop didn't couldn't follow it so the
[41:57] cop went on the other side
[41:58] of the highway and
[42:02] i literally saw this accident with my
[42:04] two eyes that lady when she came in
[42:06] front of us
[42:07] you know this is why i read this
[42:08] scripture because that lady when she
[42:10] came in front of us she was literally
[42:12] less than
[42:13] 200 feet with us i'm not good with those
[42:15] numbers but she was
[42:16] literally right in front of us driving
[42:18] and that car that was the person that
[42:20] was drunk coming in the opposite way
[42:23] they literally met up and both car went
[42:26] up in the air
[42:27] and the driver was just frozen
[42:30] like the car 300 feet like 65 miles
[42:33] we can't just literally go after them
[42:35] all the sudden the car just stopped
[42:38] you know i was just like this new
[42:39] technology is crazy but it was not the
[42:41] technology that was the hand of god to
[42:43] preserve us
[42:44] and you know we just literally just
[42:46] stopped we saw
[42:48] both cars went up in the air and they
[42:50] went both down so they were coming at
[42:52] the very same speed
[42:54] the drunk guy that came on the opposite
[42:56] side
[42:57] died on the scene they took him dead the
[43:00] lady that came in front of us
[43:01] she was the bones was broken they were
[43:04] taking her like
[43:05] a fish like something really like the
[43:08] body is
[43:08] nothing you know i sat there all of a
[43:11] sudden
[43:12] all the life goals that we was talking
[43:14] about i'm accomplishing this i'm trying
[43:16] to do this
[43:17] it seemed like it was nothing all of it
[43:19] became like a
[43:21] very foul of sound where i was just like
[43:24] you know we can plan everything but the
[43:26] lord really has control
[43:28] and he it made me see life differently i
[43:31] was just like
[43:32] god literally gave that lady for my life
[43:35] and my brother's life
[43:37] because had he not be that lady being in
[43:39] front of us
[43:40] would have been we would have been
[43:42] crushed because the dude's car was much
[43:43] stronger than ours
[43:45] you know it's anyway it's all plastic
[43:47] but the grace of god really has been
[43:49] kind to me so i wanted to share it it
[43:50] may seem little but it means a lot to me
[43:54] [Applause]
[44:21] god bless you
[44:24] brother william taught me a little song
[44:27] that he wrote
[44:28] and just wanted to accompany him when he
[44:32] sings it
[44:42] god bless you we're singing faith is the
[44:45] substance

[56:16] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[56:18] this mountain nor yet at jerusalem
[56:20] worship the father
[56:21] ye worship you know not what we know
[56:24] what we worship
[56:25] for salvation is of the jews but the
[56:28] hour cometh
[56:28] and now is when the true worshiper shall
[56:31] worship the father in spirit and in
[56:33] truth
[56:34] for the father seeketh such to worship
[56:37] him
[56:38] god is a spirit and they that worship
[56:40] him must worship him in spirit
[56:42] and in truth amen let's just bow our
[56:45] heads in a word of prayer
[56:47] heavenly father as we've read your word
[56:49] this evening lord and
[56:52] lord no doubt many of
[56:55] thousands upon millions and millions
[56:57] have read scriptures before
[56:59] but lord we know that only the holy
[57:01] ghost can
[57:02] open the word to us for what we have
[57:05] need of in
[57:05] in our hour that we're living in right
[57:07] now lord we just pray that your holy
[57:10] spirit would walk up and down the aisles
[57:11] of every heart this evening
[57:13] lord that you'd minister the needs of
[57:15] your people oh god
[57:16] i'm just a mortal man lord who's been
[57:20] following their lot to to minister the
[57:23] word of life to your people
[57:25] may i just get completely out of the way
[57:26] lord and let your spirit have the
[57:28] preeminence in the service
[57:29] lord you're the one that knows the needs
[57:31] of every heart here this evening father
[57:33] and
[57:33] only you can minister to those needs
[57:35] father and we place it into your hands
[57:37] lord we deny all human ability lord for
[57:40] there is no human ability that can break
[57:42] the word of life
[57:43] only the spirit of god the lord that
[57:46] could come down and
[57:47] speak to your people that drew us out of
[57:49] the world unto yourself can do it
[57:51] we just place the service into your
[57:52] hands and ask your perfect will be done
[57:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[57:56] pray amen
[57:58] amen you may be seated
[58:06] don't maybe necessarily have a title for
[58:09] the service
[58:09] this evening i just uh you know though i
[58:12] guess supposedly
[58:14] uh i suppose the way the lord works with
[58:16] each uh
[58:17] person who ministers is definitely
[58:19] different and i know
[58:20] the way the lord works with me it seems
[58:21] like the lord will give me inspirations
[58:23] and i just
[58:24] i have such a struggle to take those
[58:27] inspirations and put them down in a
[58:29] in a way that i can maybe write it down
[58:31] so many are much better at taking notes
[58:33] and things but
[58:34] i just have to rely upon inspiration of
[58:36] the spirit so
[58:37] you just bear with me uh you know praise
[58:40] the lord
[58:41] we don't rely on human ability if we did
[58:43] we'd be
[58:44] we'd be of men most miserable because
[58:46] surely i couldn't save you though it
[58:47] would be my desire to
[58:48] and we couldn't save each other but the
[58:51] blood of jesus christ
[58:53] saves each one i was just struck
[58:57] uh you know i i find and i'm so grateful
[59:00] you know as a minister you take
[59:01] inspiration from everywhere and from
[59:03] each other you
[59:04] hear the minister the ministries that
[59:06] come through and
[59:07] and the lord inspires them and then you
[59:09] just catch a little thread here and
[59:10] there and
[59:11] the lord you start pulling on that
[59:12] thread and the lord just starts
[59:14] revealing things and really just
[59:16] inspiring and
[59:17] i i i find lately i've just been really
[59:19] inspired by different
[59:20] uh the word that our pastor's been
[59:22] bringing and particularly last wednesday
[59:25] you know speaking on
[59:26] the influence of the age that we're
[59:27] living in and how we have to fight
[59:29] against that ins
[59:30] that that inspiration that the the age
[59:32] is the that laodicean spirit
[59:35] you know such a desire you know i hear
[59:38] this word maybe nowadays
[59:39] uh tossed about so much of individuality
[59:42] you know
[59:43] we have to be your own person and you
[59:44] have to be this and you have to be that
[59:46] and uh we were even discussing it after
[59:48] the service and
[59:50] and you come to realize when you have a
[59:52] real revelation of
[59:53] of what part of what this message that
[59:55] we've that we've received has brought
[59:58] is when you become a christian and the
[59:59] holy ghost
[1:00:01] has baptized you in the body of jesus
[1:00:03] christ you've
[1:00:04] forfeited every one of those rights
[1:00:07] we've voluntarily
[1:00:08] laid those things down at the feet of
[1:00:11] jesus christ and said lord
[1:00:12] i don't want any of my own desires
[1:00:14] anymore i don't want my own wants
[1:00:17] anymore because
[1:00:18] you know when how many could testify
[1:00:20] when we were younger and even
[1:00:21] and even now in the natural we don't
[1:00:23] even know what we want
[1:00:25] you know one day you want this and the
[1:00:26] other day you want that ask my wife you
[1:00:28] know what she wants for dinner and
[1:00:30] one second it's one thing and the next
[1:00:31] it's another you know that's that's the
[1:00:33] old joke
[1:00:34] well what do you want to eat well i
[1:00:35] don't know what do you want to eat and
[1:00:36] nobody knows what they want
[1:00:38] but we have a heavenly father who knows
[1:00:40] what we
[1:00:41] need in our lives we have we have a
[1:00:43] heavenly father
[1:00:44] who if we could just lay down at his
[1:00:46] feet for just uh just a minute maybe
[1:00:49] but you know so many times we get up and
[1:00:51] we have to go about our days and
[1:00:53] we run to and fro because the the the
[1:00:55] spirit of the ages put such a time
[1:00:57] pressure on us you know it's amazing
[1:01:00] isn't it all the technology and things
[1:01:02] that we have
[1:01:03] that try to make our lives easier and
[1:01:05] yet it seems we have less time than we
[1:01:07] ever did
[1:01:08] we're running to and fro and the
[1:01:09] scripture declares that if leaving the
[1:01:11] book of daniel
[1:01:12] men would run to and fro doing this and
[1:01:14] that and we've seen it coming to pass in
[1:01:16] our day
[1:01:18] and it's so hard because uh in the
[1:01:20] natural man and i find the lord just
[1:01:22] impressing it upon my heart
[1:01:24] that we have to as as believers and holy
[1:01:27] ghost-filled christians
[1:01:28] we must absolutely divorce ourselves
[1:01:31] from every bit of the carnal mind
[1:01:35] that has tried to to lay itself upon you
[1:01:38] in this age
[1:01:39] because this age is just constantly
[1:01:42] forcing carnality upon you
[1:01:44] as our pastor was even ministering last
[1:01:47] wednesday
[1:01:48] it comes in this age it seems right now
[1:01:50] the the big thing is
[1:01:52] is such that an identification with a
[1:01:54] certain group or a certain
[1:01:56] cause how our pastor kind of brought
[1:01:58] that out a little bit how they
[1:02:00] they want to sweep you up in a spirit of
[1:02:02] some cause or this or that
[1:02:04] get you stacked on one side or one on
[1:02:06] the other
[1:02:07] but our prophet even had to tell us over
[1:02:09] and over again
[1:02:10] that we don't take sides with any of
[1:02:12] those things
[1:02:13] because as a christian we walk right
[1:02:15] down the middle we find out you could go
[1:02:17] off into one side on fanaticism
[1:02:19] and just go off the deep end over here
[1:02:21] you can go off on one side on the other
[1:02:23] side of fanaticism
[1:02:24] and run straight on the deep end but we
[1:02:26] want to stand as christians in the
[1:02:28] middle
[1:02:28] be able to bridge the gap and say if you
[1:02:31] just come to christ
[1:02:32] all of your problems could be solved
[1:02:37] they want to talk about a pro this
[1:02:38] program and that program and this idea
[1:02:41] and that idea
[1:02:42] but we don't have any ideas than a
[1:02:44] profit the only idea
[1:02:46] that can profit as a baptism of the holy
[1:02:48] ghost into the body of jesus christ
[1:02:53] but the world tries to pull us in
[1:02:56] constantly throwing things out and it's
[1:02:59] one of the greatest tricks of the devil
[1:03:01] is he he he injects so much truth
[1:03:05] into what's being said so they'll want
[1:03:07] to run you off on this cause or that
[1:03:09] cause this idea that idea
[1:03:11] and they'll throw so much truth in with
[1:03:13] it and it may be a noble idea
[1:03:17] but noble ideas brought in a carnal
[1:03:20] manner
[1:03:21] will only bring forth carnal fruits
[1:03:25] because the only way to bring forth a
[1:03:27] true millennium which they're trying to
[1:03:29] do our prophet taught us
[1:03:31] they're looking for their superman
[1:03:32] they're looking for their
[1:03:34] their they you know we talk we talk
[1:03:36] about their their natural
[1:03:37] order of things to bring men into
[1:03:39] subjection they've been doing it since
[1:03:41] the tower of babel
[1:03:43] when that nimrod religion was trying to
[1:03:45] grab all men
[1:03:47] and start subjecting them to a certain
[1:03:50] power to bring a forced unity
[1:03:52] i believe it's what the prophet said in
[1:03:53] the church age book is that it would be
[1:03:55] a forced unity
[1:03:57] but see what we want is the unity of the
[1:03:59] spirit
[1:04:00] in the bond of peace in the holy ghost
[1:04:03] something that can't be
[1:04:04] faked by a natural system but it's
[1:04:07] brought about supernaturally by the holy
[1:04:10] ghost
[1:04:12] because we've seen it even so much in
[1:04:14] the message that people want to
[1:04:16] take one side on this and one side on
[1:04:18] that one group's got their pet doctrine
[1:04:20] here
[1:04:21] one group's got their own little ideas
[1:04:23] here i don't want to have any ideas
[1:04:25] except for jesus christ i just want to
[1:04:28] have the mind of christ
[1:04:32] we find and i know we've been talking
[1:04:34] about that natural mind
[1:04:35] and knowledge so much but if i could
[1:04:37] just interject this a little bit to tie
[1:04:39] it in here
[1:04:40] what you know so many times there's so
[1:04:42] much of a pride
[1:04:43] you know as a man us brothers can kind
[1:04:46] of relate right
[1:04:47] you don't want us so many times we won't
[1:04:49] people don't like to admit when they
[1:04:50] just don't know
[1:04:53] we want to know all the mysteries we
[1:04:56] don't know all the mysteries
[1:04:57] and then sometimes it's hard for us to
[1:04:59] admit because we've
[1:05:01] by by the grace of the lord we've got
[1:05:03] the message of the hour
[1:05:05] we've got the answer to the devil's
[1:05:06] question and it's true
[1:05:09] because the answer to the devil's
[1:05:10] question is the word of god
[1:05:12] it is the holy ghost but the devil comes
[1:05:15] well you can't explain it this way you
[1:05:17] can't do it this and that
[1:05:18] and that's why we've so many times run
[1:05:21] off on tangents
[1:05:22] because the the the noble desire is
[1:05:25] there
[1:05:26] to understand the things of god
[1:05:29] i believe the scripture even says maybe
[1:05:31] ecclesiastes
[1:05:32] get unto thy self-understanding it's
[1:05:35] it's a noble thing to have
[1:05:37] but unless it be the understanding of
[1:05:39] the mind of christ
[1:05:42] it won't profit anything but drag one
[1:05:45] over this way
[1:05:46] one over that way dividing brotherhood
[1:05:50] bringing division where we could stand
[1:05:53] judges like the brothers though you know
[1:05:55] you get a you get a you get something
[1:05:57] that you got actually my father-in-law
[1:05:58] over there they just had an ikea thing
[1:06:00] to assemble you know
[1:06:01] and what's the old joke you know you get
[1:06:03] that thing out there and then
[1:06:04] do you need the instructions now do you
[1:06:07] know how to put it together no
[1:06:09] but i'll figure it out and that's
[1:06:11] sometimes how it is spiritually
[1:06:14] we we don't have all the information yet
[1:06:16] because the lord it's not time to reveal
[1:06:18] it
[1:06:19] but we run out remember brother branham
[1:06:21] even cautioned us on that
[1:06:22] he called it presuming to venture
[1:06:25] without authority
[1:06:27] to walk out there with some grand idea
[1:06:30] or some grand
[1:06:31] plan that it looks so good but there is
[1:06:34] a way that seemeth right unto a man
[1:06:37] but the end thereof is death
[1:06:41] and you find it because it starts to
[1:06:43] divide brother against brother
[1:06:45] little isms and schisms start to
[1:06:48] worm their way in there what we need is
[1:06:51] the holy ghost
[1:06:52] to come down with the old weed eater and
[1:06:54] start pulling those weeds out
[1:06:56] pulling every root of bitterness out of
[1:06:58] our hearts pulling every
[1:07:00] little idea that exalts itself above the
[1:07:02] knowledge of jesus christ
[1:07:07] we've got so in heaven we literally
[1:07:10] have an infinite bountiful treasure
[1:07:13] house
[1:07:14] to pull from
[1:07:17] but we've got to learn how to pull in
[1:07:19] faith
[1:07:21] for the things that we have need of
[1:07:24] what does the scripture say he says you
[1:07:26] have not because you ask not
[1:07:28] but then when you do ask you ask to
[1:07:31] consume it upon your lusts
[1:07:33] so maybe sometimes we have to check
[1:07:35] ourselves why
[1:07:37] do i want to know these great mysteries
[1:07:38] do i want to look up like some great big
[1:07:40] man do i want to make myself a name in
[1:07:43] the message
[1:07:44] do i want to be some great preacher
[1:07:49] the lord will reveal his word by
[1:07:52] bringing it to pass
[1:07:54] he will make known the revelation you
[1:07:56] can better believe of revelation of the
[1:07:58] body change will come i'm gonna know it
[1:07:59] you know how because my body will be
[1:08:02] changed
[1:08:02] glory to god i won't need someone to
[1:08:06] pull out a diagram and tell me how it's
[1:08:08] gonna work
[1:08:09] the holy spirit will reveal it in the
[1:08:11] hour that i have needles
[1:08:14] but the but the spirit the lord is
[1:08:16] looking for true worshipers
[1:08:19] to worship in spirit and in truth
[1:08:23] a lot of people have anointings a lot of
[1:08:26] people have
[1:08:26] anointings of the spirit our prophet
[1:08:29] preached that message anointed ones at
[1:08:31] the end times
[1:08:33] surely they can bring down anointings
[1:08:35] but except
[1:08:36] accept the anointing be coupled with
[1:08:39] truth
[1:08:40] there's no profit to it because that
[1:08:43] anointing
[1:08:44] can cause that tear to grow just as much
[1:08:47] as it causes the wheat to grow
[1:08:50] in fact if you know anything about which
[1:08:52] i've learned and i've told you many
[1:08:53] times
[1:08:54] about taking care of your lawn the weeds
[1:08:56] actually tend to spring up a little bit
[1:08:58] faster
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:03] that's why they say you're growing like
[1:09:04] a weed
[1:09:06] because you just sprung up two inches
[1:09:08] overnight it never ceases to amaze me i
[1:09:10] mow my lawn
[1:09:12] a little rain falls grass grew a quarter
[1:09:14] of an inch that we grew three inches i
[1:09:16] don't understand it
[1:09:18] but don't worry though if the sun comes
[1:09:19] out it'll burn it down
[1:09:21] they'll see what kind of foundation it's
[1:09:23] built upon
[1:09:26] but he's looking for worshipers true
[1:09:29] worshipers
[1:09:30] that will worship in spirit and in truth
[1:09:35] and we've received the truth we have
[1:09:38] received
[1:09:39] the gospel
[1:09:42] the rest of the world has a gospel
[1:09:46] this is the gospel
[1:09:50] and only in this gospel the gospel of
[1:09:52] jesus christ for this hour
[1:09:54] we call it the message but it's nothing
[1:09:57] other than a revelation of jesus christ
[1:10:00] we've given it a natural name but it's
[1:10:02] nothing other than the revealed
[1:10:04] life of jesus christ for a rapture age
[1:10:08] if i could put it that way just as much
[1:10:12] as noah was a revealed word for an age
[1:10:15] of
[1:10:16] overcoming through a through a flood
[1:10:20] this message is even more so because it
[1:10:23] goes back to enoch
[1:10:25] who is out of there before the flight
[1:10:26] even came
[1:10:28] but the lord is what does he say he said
[1:10:30] the father
[1:10:31] seeketh such i can testify to that he
[1:10:35] sought me out
[1:10:37] wasn't looking for him knew that there
[1:10:39] was something missing
[1:10:41] couldn't put your finger on it but when
[1:10:43] that light struck the seed
[1:10:48] all the devils in hell can't stop it
[1:10:51] from coming to life
[1:10:56] hallelujah
[1:10:58] i learned a lot through tending my yard
[1:11:01] you know they say
[1:11:02] you ever notice how in the when the
[1:11:04] winter's just ending around here
[1:11:06] that grass starts to grow earlier around
[1:11:08] that concrete
[1:11:09] you know why it's because the concrete
[1:11:11] holds the heat from the sun
[1:11:13] and then it can warm up that soil a
[1:11:14] little bit more you know sometimes when
[1:11:16] you're being held down
[1:11:18] by those worldly pressures that pressure
[1:11:21] remember
[1:11:21] pressure creates heat how many remember
[1:11:23] that from science class
[1:11:25] pressure creates heat heat just warms
[1:11:27] you up just enough
[1:11:29] or maybe you can receive something from
[1:11:31] god
[1:11:32] thinking that strange concerning the
[1:11:34] fiery trials that are to try you
[1:11:37] they are more precious than gold
[1:11:42] hallelujah
[1:11:45] those trials are made for you tailor
[1:11:48] made
[1:11:50] just for you oh we put we put see we put
[1:11:53] bible characters
[1:11:56] on on a pedestal you know who the only
[1:11:59] bible character is
[1:12:01] it's jesus christ
[1:12:04] because job was a bible character but it
[1:12:07] was the character of christ
[1:12:09] in job that could say though he slay me
[1:12:14] i will trust him i imagine when jesus
[1:12:17] was on the cross that scripture went
[1:12:19] through his mind
[1:12:19] as he laid there oh my god save me
[1:12:24] my god my god why is thou forsaken me
[1:12:28] and then that scripture may be crossed
[1:12:30] through his mind though he slay me
[1:12:32] yet i trust him i lay my life down i'll
[1:12:36] take it up again
[1:12:38] hallelujah that's the character of
[1:12:41] christ in job
[1:12:43] and when you're going through those
[1:12:44] fiery trials and the devil's taking
[1:12:47] everything
[1:12:47] that god let him take from you
[1:12:50] because he can't touch you without
[1:12:52] permission
[1:12:54] he can't touch you without permission
[1:12:59] i remember i remember looking at well
[1:13:02] forgive me maybe it's a carnal example
[1:13:03] but it just came to my mind
[1:13:04] i remember i used to really like
[1:13:05] watching basketball and they'd always
[1:13:07] had the little nba thing at the end
[1:13:09] and they said this broadcast cannot be
[1:13:11] disseminated without express written
[1:13:12] consent from the nba
[1:13:15] that means the nba owned it in order to
[1:13:18] broadcast you needed permission
[1:13:20] that's what the devil has to have from
[1:13:21] you he says he has to go up to god
[1:13:25] say lord because the devils believe in
[1:13:29] trash
[1:13:30] oh the devil knows who's really in
[1:13:32] charge he may not act like it
[1:13:35] that's the difference is the devil knows
[1:13:38] but iniquity was found in his heart
[1:13:41] iniquity remember means you know what
[1:13:42] the right thing is and you won't do it
[1:13:44] anyhow
[1:13:46] so he knows god is god
[1:13:49] he was the covering cherub thou has been
[1:13:52] a need of the garden of god
[1:13:55] but he has to go and say lord could i
[1:13:58] maybe just
[1:13:59] please try manasseh one time
[1:14:03] and the lord you know he does he looks
[1:14:04] down at brother manasseh he sees you
[1:14:06] know what
[1:14:08] he can take it how do i know that he
[1:14:10] says because he won't
[1:14:11] put anything on you that you cannot bear
[1:14:15] see the see the the script he's got the
[1:14:18] answer
[1:14:19] every time for the devil's question well
[1:14:21] why am i going through this
[1:14:24] because he won't put anything on you
[1:14:26] that you cannot bear
[1:14:28] and you know what that gold has got to
[1:14:30] go through the fire
[1:14:32] it's got to go through the fire it's got
[1:14:34] to get heated up and then after it's
[1:14:36] gone through the fire
[1:14:37] it's got to go to the anvil and get
[1:14:39] beaten down a little more
[1:14:43] and we wonder why we're going through
[1:14:45] trials
[1:14:46] praise the lord for the test that trial
[1:14:50] you don't even know what's happening
[1:14:52] like we preached last time about that
[1:14:54] butterfly
[1:14:54] it doesn't even know it's being broken
[1:14:57] down and reassembled bit by bit
[1:14:59] molecule by molecule and you don't even
[1:15:02] know
[1:15:02] when you're going through that trial the
[1:15:05] master's hammer beating on you
[1:15:07] beating you know who the master's hammer
[1:15:09] is the devil
[1:15:11] he ain't nothing but a tool in the hand
[1:15:12] of god to bring you closer to him
[1:15:16] the devil ain't nothing but a tool in
[1:15:19] the hand of god
[1:15:23] he is god's servant
[1:15:27] he is god's servant unwilling though it
[1:15:31] may be
[1:15:32] all things will serve our god
[1:15:43] you know i work i'm an air traffic
[1:15:45] controller and we have a book we call
[1:15:47] our bible i hate to use that that's
[1:15:48] almost the sacrilegious but we call it's
[1:15:50] the 71 10.65
[1:15:52] it's rules and regulations for air
[1:15:54] traffic it's like 5 000 pages longer it
[1:15:56] feels like it
[1:15:57] because it's written by lawyers and they
[1:16:00] have
[1:16:00] definitions for terms and in one of
[1:16:03] those is the word must or shall
[1:16:05] indicates that something has to be done
[1:16:08] that way
[1:16:10] so there's no question about it every
[1:16:12] knee
[1:16:13] shall bow every tongue shall confess
[1:16:17] there's no ifs ands or buts that
[1:16:19] includes you devil
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:24] and he doesn't even know it that's why i
[1:16:27] love our god so much
[1:16:28] because the scripture says he'll catch
[1:16:30] the crafty in their own snare
[1:16:32] he'll catch the wicked in their own
[1:16:34] devices the lord is
[1:16:36] 500 steps ahead of these so-called
[1:16:39] geniuses out there
[1:16:40] because he saw the end from the
[1:16:42] beginning and he planned it so perfectly
[1:16:46] the devil is literally trying to do
[1:16:48] everything he can
[1:16:50] opposite of god and everything he's
[1:16:52] doing is playing right into his hands
[1:16:56] praise our god
[1:16:59] and it's so fixed it's a rigged game
[1:17:03] that's why he hates you that's why he
[1:17:06] despises you
[1:17:07] because though you fall seven times you
[1:17:09] get up
[1:17:10] and god's standing there saying come
[1:17:13] back i'm right here
[1:17:15] and the devil says i didn't get that
[1:17:19] and the lot god says you couldn't have
[1:17:20] it he said i gave you your shot cain
[1:17:24] i told you what to do and you wouldn't
[1:17:26] do it
[1:17:27] praise the lord for grace
[1:17:31] see when i'm weak i am strong
[1:17:34] why because his grace is sufficient
[1:17:37] because his grace is strong
[1:17:39] it has nothing to do with your strength
[1:17:41] his strength is made perfect
[1:17:43] by your weakness his glory is exalted
[1:17:47] because of your failures not that we
[1:17:49] glory in our failures
[1:17:50] but we get glory in the fact that we
[1:17:52] know
[1:17:54] no matter how much we fail he will
[1:17:57] he has grace for you to take it back
[1:18:11] that's why the devil hates so much he
[1:18:13] screwed up
[1:18:14] forgive me for saying it that way he
[1:18:16] messed up one time
[1:18:19] he's down kicked out all done why
[1:18:21] because the lord already knew what was
[1:18:22] in his heart
[1:18:24] and yet here you are looking in the
[1:18:26] mirror of god's word because you're
[1:18:28] faithful
[1:18:29] your desire you know brother branham
[1:18:30] said that there's something in a
[1:18:32] christian that always desired perfection
[1:18:35] that just good enough wasn't enough for
[1:18:37] a christian
[1:18:38] it's not good enough for a christian why
[1:18:40] because god's in you
[1:18:43] and god is perfect and there's a word
[1:18:45] that says be therefore perfect
[1:18:47] as your father in heaven is perfect and
[1:18:49] so there's a part of you that says
[1:18:51] i can't help but desire to be perfect
[1:18:53] because it's the word of god to me
[1:18:57] and see that's what i love see his grace
[1:19:00] is so far beyond anything that we've
[1:19:03] ever mentally been able to grasp
[1:19:06] oh my we need to have more grace with
[1:19:08] each other we need to have more honestly
[1:19:10] sometimes we need to have more grace for
[1:19:12] ourselves
[1:19:14] look look at yourself through god's
[1:19:15] filter look at your brothers and sisters
[1:19:17] through the filter of god's word
[1:19:20] so easy to throw stones when you're on
[1:19:23] the mountaintop
[1:19:25] those thrones are a little bit heavier
[1:19:26] when you're in the valley easy to roll
[1:19:28] the stones downhill from the mountaintop
[1:19:31] but when you've got to throw them uphill
[1:19:32] from the valley brother they don't fall
[1:19:34] they don't go very far
[1:19:35] they usually roll right back down to you
[1:19:37] you know how it goes
[1:19:39] but see god's grace is sufficient he's
[1:19:42] looking for true worshipers
[1:19:44] we've received a word for our day you
[1:19:46] don't got to figure it out
[1:19:48] i kind of ended up here again just
[1:19:50] talking about figuring out we're so
[1:19:51] worried about figuring it out
[1:19:52] every you know the the devil the devil
[1:19:55] is trying to put you in a box
[1:19:57] just like the just like the whole world
[1:20:00] throughout
[1:20:00] all of what we call religious history in
[1:20:02] the church has that church has always
[1:20:04] at some point tried to put god in their
[1:20:06] little box
[1:20:08] this far and this is as much as we'll
[1:20:09] take this this is as far as we can go
[1:20:11] with luther we'll
[1:20:12] justifications that that's great but
[1:20:14] sanctification i don't know if we can
[1:20:16] deal with that
[1:20:17] and so god says okay i'll just move on
[1:20:19] because sanctification is part of me
[1:20:21] and then they go beyond that to
[1:20:23] pentecost and restoration of the gifts
[1:20:25] and somebody said well we just can't
[1:20:26] take that's fanaticism
[1:20:29] and yeah it did run into fanaticism but
[1:20:31] there's truth to it
[1:20:33] the devils put up all those scarecrows
[1:20:35] over the gifts of god
[1:20:36] you know brother branham said every
[1:20:38] local body should have those nine
[1:20:40] spiritual gifts in operation in the
[1:20:41] church
[1:20:42] each local body should have though you
[1:20:45] know he said therefore he said
[1:20:47] for the cleansing of the church to call
[1:20:49] out sin
[1:20:50] to bring things to life that need to be
[1:20:52] rooted out
[1:20:54] but you see the devil had put this
[1:20:56] scarecrows up sure there's carnal
[1:20:58] impersonations
[1:20:59] there's men out there looking for money
[1:21:01] sitting out there oh someone in the
[1:21:02] back's got a backache
[1:21:03] and like everybody has a backache
[1:21:05] because that's what happens when you
[1:21:06] turn 35.
[1:21:10] i mean they're you know it's it's
[1:21:12] amazing because everything that the
[1:21:13] devil would accuse the true prophet of
[1:21:15] doing
[1:21:16] is everything he's doing because that's
[1:21:18] what he does
[1:21:19] he is a manipulator he's a liar how do
[1:21:22] you know the devil's lying because his
[1:21:23] mouth is moving
[1:21:29] but see the devils put up all these
[1:21:30] scarecrows and say oh
[1:21:32] well that's just a money scheme so these
[1:21:34] gifts can't really be real or
[1:21:36] they went all into fanaticism and they
[1:21:38] glen they cling only to the gifts no sir
[1:21:41] see we we are beyond that we ought to be
[1:21:43] more mature than that we are more mature
[1:21:45] than that
[1:21:46] because we can take the gifts of god and
[1:21:49] filter them through the word of god
[1:21:51] to understand how to use it properly but
[1:21:54] we've got to get ourselves in the
[1:21:56] channel to where god can move
[1:21:59] because god's not going to come to our
[1:22:00] channel we need to get in his
[1:22:10] god is not going to be on our side we
[1:22:13] need to be on his side
[1:22:14] that's i believe as moses said whosoever
[1:22:17] is on the lord's side
[1:22:18] not my side he wasn't talking about
[1:22:20] himself he said who's on the lord's side
[1:22:26] so we need to be cognizant of that the
[1:22:29] lord is looking for true worshipers
[1:22:31] we've got to identify ourselves with him
[1:22:34] with him and him alone
[1:22:36] the world is vying for your attention
[1:22:39] particularly the young people vying for
[1:22:42] your attention
[1:22:43] whether when you're when you're in
[1:22:45] school what are all the different things
[1:22:47] you have the nerds
[1:22:48] you got the band geeks i was a band geek
[1:22:51] so i know
[1:22:52] you you beca what is it it becomes what
[1:22:54] is it becomes an identification
[1:22:56] are you a sports person are you are you
[1:22:59] a teacher's pet
[1:23:00] as they say are you this and are you
[1:23:01] that what are they trying to do they're
[1:23:03] trying to pin identifications to you
[1:23:06] and when you be when you when you grow
[1:23:08] up and you get into the into the into
[1:23:09] the job world and
[1:23:10] and in the collegiate levels and stuff
[1:23:12] it's like where are you going to be this
[1:23:13] are you going to identify as this are
[1:23:15] you going to be a liberal arts major
[1:23:16] you're going to be this what are they
[1:23:17] trying to do they're trying to take your
[1:23:19] identity
[1:23:20] and attach it to something carnal
[1:23:25] our identity is only in one thing and
[1:23:27] that is jesus christ
[1:23:29] that's why paul could say he said one
[1:23:32] says i'm of apollos
[1:23:33] one says of a peter one says i'm a paul
[1:23:36] he says was paul is christ divided
[1:23:39] was paul crucified for you
[1:23:43] no sir so what is our identification
[1:23:46] the devil's trying to put all these isms
[1:23:48] and schisms put little things everywhere
[1:23:50] by the grace of god we're rising above
[1:23:52] that we're rising above that so what do
[1:23:54] we do we become true worshipers
[1:23:56] we worship in spirit and in truth but
[1:23:59] it's got to be more
[1:24:01] than just see because if you're
[1:24:03] identified with it
[1:24:04] if there's an identification there's a
[1:24:06] mark that comes with it
[1:24:08] how did you know the guys were on the
[1:24:10] football team because every friday
[1:24:12] before the football game they wore those
[1:24:13] jerseys man
[1:24:15] they wore those jerseys around the
[1:24:16] school all the cheerleaders wore their
[1:24:18] little
[1:24:19] things and everything and everybody was
[1:24:21] wearing their stuff what were they doing
[1:24:22] they were identifying themselves
[1:24:25] as to who they were if it'd be that way
[1:24:29] for the world how much more do we have
[1:24:31] to identify ourselves with christ
[1:24:34] you've got to be willing to lose your
[1:24:37] own
[1:24:38] reputation your own
[1:24:42] social standing your own carnal level
[1:24:46] of whatever it might be and condescend
[1:24:49] to his level why because christ said
[1:24:52] take take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:24:54] me
[1:24:54] he says for i am meek and lowly in heart
[1:24:57] and you shall
[1:24:58] find rest into your souls people don't
[1:25:01] want to be meek
[1:25:02] people don't want to be lowly
[1:25:03] particularly in america where we're
[1:25:05] americans
[1:25:06] we've got it down everybody bows to us
[1:25:09] because we are
[1:25:10] the world empire we have been a world
[1:25:13] empire for a long time
[1:25:15] and i'm not even talking about the
[1:25:16] natural i'm talking about spiritual
[1:25:18] because we had a prophet that came and
[1:25:20] condemned to this nation already
[1:25:22] already indicted her she's gone and only
[1:25:26] now are we seeing
[1:25:27] more of the fruits of that
[1:25:30] and people and we know people think that
[1:25:32] they're going to save it but all that is
[1:25:34] is lot doing his thing lot pleading
[1:25:38] with the sodomites all my brothers do
[1:25:41] not this wicked thing he called them
[1:25:42] brothers
[1:25:44] that showed who did he identify with but
[1:25:46] see if that's going on now that's why we
[1:25:48] don't get caught up in that
[1:25:50] why because if that's going on there's
[1:25:52] something else going on up the hill
[1:25:54] where nobody else could see and
[1:25:56] something was happening with abraham
[1:25:58] brothers and sisters
[1:25:59] something was happening with sarah
[1:26:04] they were about ready to receive a
[1:26:05] promise
[1:26:07] and you know what you know what the
[1:26:09] powerful thing is is god will
[1:26:11] use you god will use this bride god will
[1:26:14] use
[1:26:15] that royal seed of abraham to even save
[1:26:17] the lots
[1:26:19] because that's what he did not once but
[1:26:21] twice
[1:26:22] pulled them out of the fire one time
[1:26:24] when they got kidnapped and
[1:26:26] their prayers are what pulled them out
[1:26:28] the second time
[1:26:29] before it all burned that's why we ought
[1:26:32] to be sighing and crying
[1:26:35] sighing and crying for the abominations
[1:26:37] lord help me
[1:26:39] we ought to be have more tender hearts
[1:26:41] the the world has hardened our hearts
[1:26:43] when it comes to being sensitive to the
[1:26:45] holy ghost
[1:26:46] why because you can't be a manly man and
[1:26:48] you got to be tough and tough it out no
[1:26:51] jesus wept on the top of that mountain
[1:26:53] and said jerusalem jerusalem how i would
[1:26:55] have hovered you
[1:26:56] but you would not that's the spirit of
[1:26:58] christ that's the spirit of a real man
[1:27:01] who can enter into the sufferings of
[1:27:03] another and and get into that channel
[1:27:06] and and weep before god and be broken
[1:27:10] before god we need to break up the
[1:27:11] fallow ground
[1:27:19] but something was going on with abraham
[1:27:20] and sarah brothers and sisters
[1:27:22] and we've been hearing a little bit
[1:27:23] about our pastor minister around
[1:27:25] melchizedek
[1:27:26] but there was something happening there
[1:27:28] there was a change taking place
[1:27:31] didn't even they didn't know it many of
[1:27:33] us have been on that road just like
[1:27:35] abraham and sarah a long while
[1:27:37] just pressing the battles yeah you're
[1:27:39] failing sometimes
[1:27:41] but you're getting back up and you're
[1:27:42] pressing you're just going on going on
[1:27:44] but there's a change happening the whole
[1:27:46] time and every once in a while you get
[1:27:48] before lord and say lord just like
[1:27:49] abraham and say lord is this going to
[1:27:51] happen or not
[1:27:53] and you know what the lord gives grace i
[1:27:55] know because i've experienced it
[1:27:58] where i've got i said lord is this going
[1:27:59] to happen and he'll come down and send a
[1:28:01] refreshing through your life
[1:28:03] and confirm that promise again and then
[1:28:05] you just keep on pressing
[1:28:07] i believe a god even god even confirmed
[1:28:10] it to abraham in one way or another at
[1:28:11] least three times maybe four times
[1:28:14] before even melchizedek came just the
[1:28:16] lord would come down and abraham would
[1:28:18] be distraught and say
[1:28:19] is this is this is this man gonna
[1:28:22] inherit everything that i have this this
[1:28:25] eleazar
[1:28:26] and the lord has to say no out of your
[1:28:28] out of your bowels it's coming
[1:28:30] your seed will inherit the gates of the
[1:28:32] enemy they're going to take the gates of
[1:28:34] the enemy
[1:28:35] had to confirm it to him and and i thank
[1:28:37] the lord for that because we need those
[1:28:38] times
[1:28:39] but all the while there's a change
[1:28:41] happening he doesn't even know it
[1:28:43] they're just
[1:28:43] it feels like they're wandering
[1:28:45] sometimes it feels like you're wandering
[1:28:46] don't know what direction you're going
[1:28:48] but the only thing we know is to follow
[1:28:50] the bloody footprints
[1:28:52] you stick with the word you follow the
[1:28:54] leading of the spirit
[1:28:56] he's looking for true worshipers not not
[1:28:58] people that just want to be
[1:29:00] there's a lot of hangers on it's easy
[1:29:03] see because true identification is more
[1:29:06] than surface deep
[1:29:07] there were many that were identified and
[1:29:10] i put that in air quotes identified with
[1:29:12] jesus for a season
[1:29:13] when he was on the scene but when he
[1:29:16] said
[1:29:16] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:29:18] man to drink his blood you have no part
[1:29:20] with you
[1:29:21] and i tell you what i feel like right
[1:29:23] now in the message with all the things
[1:29:24] that have happened over the past year
[1:29:25] year and a half
[1:29:27] kind of feels like a moment like that to
[1:29:28] me where all of a sudden things
[1:29:31] people are looking at certain things and
[1:29:32] questioning and saying i don't
[1:29:33] understand
[1:29:35] i don't understand why things are the
[1:29:37] disciples didn't understand
[1:29:39] they didn't know but the only thing they
[1:29:41] knew
[1:29:43] was that revelation that they had
[1:29:44] received from the beginning thou art the
[1:29:46] christ the son of the living god
[1:29:48] and that's what i've received is this
[1:29:50] message thou art the christ the son of
[1:29:52] the living god
[1:29:54] this word is the son of the living god
[1:29:56] the very god of heaven
[1:29:58] condescended down in this age to bring
[1:30:01] his bride to a rapture
[1:30:03] i don't know anything else beyond that
[1:30:05] except what he'll reveal me
[1:30:08] and i praise the lord you know what i
[1:30:09] only want to know what i need to know
[1:30:10] anyway
[1:30:12] i have a hard time keeping track of the
[1:30:14] stuff i know right now
[1:30:17] and i don't say that to jest it's
[1:30:19] because you know what it is it's because
[1:30:21] the lord is trying to get us
[1:30:22] out of our carnal minds
[1:30:26] relying on your carnal mind relying upon
[1:30:29] your own understanding relying on your
[1:30:31] own ability
[1:30:32] is to lead you down a path of heartbreak
[1:30:35] and sadness and depression and all these
[1:30:38] things god because
[1:30:39] because you're going to come to the
[1:30:40] cruel realization that without jesus
[1:30:43] christ you are nothing
[1:30:45] without the holy ghost you're nothing
[1:30:49] from dust you came and dust your return
[1:30:52] but with that scene of god in you
[1:30:56] more than ten thousand worlds it's worth
[1:30:59] more
[1:30:59] than than you could even possibly
[1:31:01] imagine but it's that paradox
[1:31:03] it lays in there and yet
[1:31:06] we've got to be humble enough to
[1:31:08] understand that without him
[1:31:10] he said what he said jesus told them he
[1:31:13] said without me
[1:31:14] you can do nothing without me you can do
[1:31:18] nothing
[1:31:19] i i don't know anything else outside of
[1:31:21] him i have no ability
[1:31:23] i have no ability i know that because
[1:31:25] i've tried
[1:31:27] i've tried to figure things out on my
[1:31:29] own whether it be in the spiritual or
[1:31:31] even in the natural
[1:31:32] when it comes to just natural life we'll
[1:31:34] fret and run to and fro
[1:31:37] lord what about this lord what about
[1:31:38] that lord what about this and you know
[1:31:40] what he wants sometimes he just wants
[1:31:41] that pressure
[1:31:42] to get you down on your knees to have
[1:31:44] some fellowship with him
[1:31:46] and then he'll make it he'll he'll he'll
[1:31:48] take take care of all that
[1:31:52] i hope this is all right
[1:31:56] you've got to identify yourself with him
[1:31:59] regardless of the surroundings
[1:32:01] he said he said if you deny me before
[1:32:03] man i'll deny you before my father
[1:32:07] i believe the way things are going now
[1:32:09] we're going to get pushed
[1:32:10] we're getting pushed into a corner
[1:32:11] brothers and sisters
[1:32:14] i mean they're they're already like
[1:32:16] police shutting down churches that
[1:32:18] have done that up in canada that's just
[1:32:21] on our doorstep
[1:32:23] so if you think we're just gonna cruise
[1:32:24] through and it's all going to be nice
[1:32:26] smooth sailing
[1:32:27] we got another thing coming because it's
[1:32:30] going to go to a test
[1:32:31] because it's always our our prophet told
[1:32:34] us right right before before that art
[1:32:35] can make it through it's got to go
[1:32:36] through the hall of critics
[1:32:38] it's got it's gotta pass the test and
[1:32:40] the test
[1:32:41] is it's happening even now the rapture
[1:32:43] is happening even now
[1:32:44] but it's just gonna that's why it's a
[1:32:46] squeeze because it's pressure's building
[1:32:48] pressure's building you know what he's
[1:32:50] doing he's squeezing more of him into
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:52] and more of the world out i i appreciate
[1:32:55] see it's a paradox i don't understand he
[1:32:57] said brother how can he squeeze more in
[1:32:59] at the same time he's squeezing it out
[1:33:00] i don't know but i know he's doing it
[1:33:03] because he promised it
[1:33:04] because as he he says you draw nigh to
[1:33:07] me i'll draw an eye to you
[1:33:10] we need to talk about it more we need to
[1:33:12] be
[1:33:13] in the spirit more when we come to
[1:33:15] church we ought to have our licks of
[1:33:17] fire ready to go
[1:33:19] you know how many times maybe do we not
[1:33:22] get ourselves prepared for service we
[1:33:23] call it service
[1:33:25] we're here to perform a service to the
[1:33:26] lord to worship him
[1:33:28] to give him all that we have and how
[1:33:31] many right now
[1:33:32] just ahead we're having thoughts about
[1:33:33] what they're going to have for dinner
[1:33:36] i'm not saying i'm not saying that to
[1:33:38] accuse anybody i'm just saying let's
[1:33:39] identify the devil
[1:33:43] call him out pull out the sword
[1:33:46] and start to swing brothers and sisters
[1:33:49] because
[1:33:50] god deserves everything that you've got
[1:33:55] everything that you got doesn't save you
[1:33:57] but if you've been saved you'll give him
[1:33:59] everything that you've got
[1:34:02] another paradox but i love the lord for
[1:34:06] paradoxes
[1:34:07] because i look at myself i look i look
[1:34:10] at my shortcomings
[1:34:11] and i shouldn't be here i shouldn't be
[1:34:13] serving them i thought i'd given up so
[1:34:15] many times
[1:34:16] in so many places i'm sure many of us
[1:34:18] have been in those despairing places
[1:34:20] where we just wanted to throw our hands
[1:34:21] up and say lord
[1:34:22] i can't do it and the lord says yes
[1:34:24] that's exactly what i've been trying to
[1:34:26] get through to you for the last year
[1:34:28] you can't do it if you would rely upon
[1:34:30] me
[1:34:31] if you'd stop trying so hard according
[1:34:33] to your natural mind
[1:34:35] you'd find you know we run
[1:34:38] to and fro trying to find solutions to
[1:34:41] problems
[1:34:42] and though the solution is always right
[1:34:44] there standing next to you the presence
[1:34:45] of jesus christ
[1:34:46] just call if you would just fellowship
[1:34:48] with me if you just come
[1:34:50] and learn of me come just come
[1:34:53] fellowship with me a while
[1:34:55] i want to hear the the spirit of god
[1:34:57] speak to me like he spoke to the prophet
[1:34:59] after the storm and said would you just
[1:35:00] walk with me for a while
[1:35:02] i don't know about you i want to have a
[1:35:04] garden of eden experience
[1:35:06] i want to have an experience like enoch
[1:35:08] the scripture only says what did he do
[1:35:10] he walked with god
[1:35:12] what does that mean he put everything
[1:35:13] else aside but god
[1:35:15] he put his family aside that'd trip up
[1:35:18] some people
[1:35:19] because whether you realize it or not
[1:35:20] anything we can become an idol
[1:35:22] if it exalts itself above the knowledge
[1:35:24] of jesus christ
[1:35:26] you put you put your family before god
[1:35:28] that's an idol
[1:35:30] you put your work before god that
[1:35:31] becomes an idol you
[1:35:33] and as noble as it may seem there are
[1:35:35] things you can put before god that look
[1:35:37] good on the outside
[1:35:39] that will become an idol
[1:35:42] the pharisees are a perfect
[1:35:45] encapsulation
[1:35:46] on the outside looking perfect but their
[1:35:49] idol
[1:35:50] had become their position in standing
[1:35:53] and they kept that position in standing
[1:35:55] by appearing to be a certain thing
[1:35:59] regardless of what they truly believed
[1:36:01] on the inside
[1:36:02] because they never truly believed had
[1:36:04] they believed they would have followed
[1:36:05] jesus
[1:36:08] but don't worry unbelief doesn't hinder
[1:36:10] god
[1:36:12] i got a quote here that i'm going to
[1:36:14] read and we'll just actually we'll
[1:36:16] close here in just a minute but
[1:36:19] realize
[1:36:23] that promised seed had to come through
[1:36:25] sarah
[1:36:27] had to come through sarah god had told
[1:36:29] abraham he said
[1:36:30] he said no it won't come through
[1:36:32] anywhere anywhere else it's coming
[1:36:33] through
[1:36:34] sarah and where that sarah
[1:36:37] that type of the church though difficult
[1:36:40] as it may seem
[1:36:41] though dead is her womb looked but the
[1:36:44] scripture says she received
[1:36:45] strength to conceive seed
[1:36:49] didn't it didn't look like anything how
[1:36:50] could it happen other than a
[1:36:51] supernatural move
[1:36:53] she was a she was 90 years old old woman
[1:36:57] ceased to be with her as the way of
[1:36:59] women to be able to have children
[1:37:02] womb dead dried up all it could be
[1:37:05] there's a reason why the scripture you
[1:37:07] see the prevalence of that kind of a
[1:37:08] theme
[1:37:09] sisters in the bible not able to have
[1:37:11] the children why because god's showing
[1:37:13] something to us
[1:37:14] that when it looks the darkest it looks
[1:37:17] like it can't happen
[1:37:19] god comes on the seat he makes all of
[1:37:21] his appointments
[1:37:22] why because his word he said the word
[1:37:24] has gone forth out of my mouth
[1:37:26] it shall not return unto me bored so
[1:37:29] have i spoken so shall it be
[1:37:31] and he's spoken i can't again i can't
[1:37:34] speak for you i just know what he told
[1:37:35] me
[1:37:36] when i came to this the truth of this
[1:37:37] message he said you're going to make a
[1:37:38] rapture
[1:37:39] he spoke my name in my ear he whispered
[1:37:41] it to me i felt it as an audible wind
[1:37:43] i haven't told i haven't told everybody
[1:37:44] that but it's one of the only times
[1:37:46] ever did that he whispered by name in my
[1:37:48] ear
[1:37:49] i know what he told me i can only tell
[1:37:51] you what he told me
[1:37:53] but make your calling and election sure
[1:37:56] and when you've nailed that down
[1:37:58] then nothing can stop you when god's
[1:38:00] revealed it to you
[1:38:01] and he's told you said brother andy said
[1:38:04] andy mohan and i've called you from the
[1:38:06] foundation of the world you're going to
[1:38:07] make a rapture and you're part of my
[1:38:08] bride
[1:38:09] all these different ones he's called you
[1:38:12] he's chosen you
[1:38:14] make your calling and election sure and
[1:38:17] it's dark as it looks it doesn't matter
[1:38:20] because the promise is sure
[1:38:23] he that endureth unto the end shall be
[1:38:25] saved
[1:38:26] there's nothing that can be done about
[1:38:28] it
[1:38:29] nothing because the word went forth it
[1:38:32] won't come back void
[1:38:33] it has to be fulfilled he won't let one
[1:38:36] word of his fall to the ground
[1:38:41] and it's for his own sake because he
[1:38:43] can't deny himself
[1:38:45] and he can't deny his word and his word
[1:38:48] is in you
[1:38:50] you didn't know it for much of your life
[1:38:53] but then one day that light just swooped
[1:38:55] by
[1:38:56] maybe just an instant of time when you
[1:38:59] heard something
[1:39:00] i think about our pastor's testimony
[1:39:02] being a hippie and all these things
[1:39:04] but all it took was one time to hear
[1:39:07] the voice of a prophet speaking the true
[1:39:09] gospel
[1:39:11] and something struck and then it started
[1:39:13] a chain reaction
[1:39:14] that's going to this day i can testify
[1:39:18] i heard the word of god i heard the
[1:39:21] voice of god for this age
[1:39:23] and it started a chain reaction that
[1:39:25] can't be stopped
[1:39:29] it can't be stopped it's like a nuclear
[1:39:31] weapon
[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:33] it's a nuclear power once that chain
[1:39:36] reaction starts
[1:39:38] brother they pulled all the control rods
[1:39:40] out of my reactor
[1:39:41] a long time ago that chain reaction's
[1:39:44] going to a rapture
[1:39:46] one of these days that chain reaction is
[1:39:47] going to bubble up so much
[1:39:49] this flesh body's going to burn away in
[1:39:51] an instant
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:53] this body of flesh is going to get nuked
[1:39:56] by a spiritual fire
[1:39:58] when this mortal shall put on
[1:40:00] immortality
[1:40:04] why because one day a son of god
[1:40:08] a son of atom atom met another son of
[1:40:11] atom
[1:40:12] and you know what happens when two
[1:40:13] supernaturals collide if the
[1:40:15] supernatural the miraculous has got to
[1:40:20] happen adam's collided brother
[1:40:23] spiritual atoms spiritual fire
[1:40:28] see get out of the carnal mind all these
[1:40:31] things that are happening around the
[1:40:32] world in the natural
[1:40:35] the bride can see below the surface
[1:40:38] because she can she can see above and
[1:40:40] below and see all the things that's
[1:40:42] happening and understand
[1:40:43] these things are happening for you
[1:40:45] they're happening for me
[1:40:48] to get us in position to get us maybe a
[1:40:51] little more desperation
[1:40:54] i tell you i'm feeling a little more
[1:40:56] desperate for my family members
[1:40:57] when i see this the way the world's
[1:40:59] going
[1:41:01] you know and maybe my dad wouldn't like
[1:41:02] it if he'll hear it down the line but i
[1:41:04] know he's coming eventually
[1:41:05] but when my dad's got his like all of
[1:41:07] his all of his weapons and he says i'm a
[1:41:09] second amendment guy they ain't taking
[1:41:11] my guns
[1:41:12] i said the only the only weapon i need
[1:41:14] is the sword of the spirit
[1:41:15] and the word of god because my our
[1:41:17] weapons are not carnal
[1:41:18] but they're mighty to the tearing down
[1:41:20] of strongholds
[1:41:22] the rest of the world can go off on
[1:41:24] their isms and all their their little
[1:41:25] schemes and all their causes
[1:41:27] and many of them may look noble and
[1:41:29] people are getting caught up in them
[1:41:30] left and right
[1:41:31] but you know what's happening is there's
[1:41:32] a spiritual cause that's getting pulled
[1:41:34] together right now the wheat
[1:41:36] is being gathered together by the word
[1:41:38] of god supernaturally
[1:41:40] it's not a forced unity by one pulling
[1:41:43] one church over here and saying you come
[1:41:44] join this and you come join that but the
[1:41:47] very holy ghost
[1:41:48] the spirit of god is brooding over his
[1:41:50] bride
[1:41:52] drawing the circle tighter drawing you
[1:41:54] when you don't even know it
[1:41:56] our prophet said he said those people
[1:41:58] you thought you didn't like in the
[1:41:59] church one day your tears are going to
[1:42:01] drop
[1:42:02] when you have to leave their presence
[1:42:03] because the love of god is going to be
[1:42:05] so
[1:42:05] strong in the hearts of its people
[1:42:09] we need to find love more than we've
[1:42:11] ever needed
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:13] we need love one for the other we've got
[1:42:15] to pray one for the other
[1:42:17] we've got to have forgiveness one for
[1:42:19] the other
[1:42:22] i get jealous almost of the world and
[1:42:24] how they can accept people
[1:42:26] that have done insane things preachers
[1:42:29] do crazy things
[1:42:30] a year later they accept them back
[1:42:33] it may be carnal and that preacher maybe
[1:42:36] not have ever even repented
[1:42:37] but if they can do it that in the
[1:42:39] natural how could we not have
[1:42:41] love one for the other in the spiritual
[1:42:43] pride of jesus christ
[1:42:54] lord help us he's going to help us
[1:42:57] he is helping us
[1:43:02] my help cometh from the lord
[1:43:06] i'm gonna we'll just close on this quote
[1:43:08] i read this quote today i shared it with
[1:43:10] brother david in the back and it whew
[1:43:12] it got me because i tell you what it
[1:43:13] just shows you how rigged this thing is
[1:43:14] brothers and sisters
[1:43:16] it gets me it gives me why because
[1:43:19] there's so much pressure
[1:43:20] there's so much pressure to perform in
[1:43:22] this world you got to be some big this
[1:43:24] you know you young people all the
[1:43:26] instagram snapchat facebook all those
[1:43:28] demon infested
[1:43:29] little things that you let nest on your
[1:43:31] phone that you ought to delete right now
[1:43:33] and get rid of
[1:43:34] you know amen oh my lord have mercy
[1:43:38] but what is it doing it's putting spirit
[1:43:39] of complexes on our on our
[1:43:41] children because you got to live up to
[1:43:43] certain images you got to look a certain
[1:43:45] way you got to act a certain way you got
[1:43:46] to be cool a certain way
[1:43:47] you got and that's nothing but the devil
[1:43:49] but it puts complexes on you thinking
[1:43:51] you've got to live
[1:43:52] a certain way to be accepted by the
[1:43:53] world news flash
[1:43:55] a true christian will never be accepted
[1:43:57] by the world
[1:44:01] he said the world hates you because he
[1:44:02] hated me first
[1:44:04] so you better get used to it you better
[1:44:07] get used to it it's not going to get any
[1:44:09] better
[1:44:10] and if you're trying to fit in there you
[1:44:11] won't fit in to the pattern
[1:44:13] of jesus christ and his bride you're
[1:44:16] going to fit into one of two patterns
[1:44:18] you're going to fit the pattern of the
[1:44:19] holy ghost and the bride are you going
[1:44:21] to fit the pattern of the world
[1:44:23] you choose free moral agency now it's
[1:44:26] rigged for the beginning brothers and
[1:44:28] sisters you're going to make it
[1:44:29] i'm speaking positively for every single
[1:44:31] one of you because you're going to make
[1:44:32] it
[1:44:33] it's got it rigged brothers and sisters
[1:44:35] i'm going to read this quote this is
[1:44:36] from abraham's covenant confirmed in
[1:44:38] 1961.
[1:44:39] he says one more thing i want to get to
[1:44:41] the church now some of you sitting here
[1:44:43] last night when the anointing struck me
[1:44:45] i could feel them little flares in there
[1:44:47] i've been trying to think of it i jotted
[1:44:48] it down here so i wouldn't forget it i
[1:44:50] caught that last night
[1:44:51] that you think well i i did do and so or
[1:44:55] i did so and so
[1:44:57] many times i find people won't even come
[1:44:58] in the prayer line and won't even take
[1:45:00] their number when they're called
[1:45:01] they're afraid that we'll be called up
[1:45:03] certain things
[1:45:05] kind of sounds like why many people may
[1:45:06] be scared of the holy ghost really
[1:45:08] bringing some things into the church and
[1:45:09] working the gifts maybe people don't
[1:45:11] want
[1:45:11] things rooted out but you know our
[1:45:12] prophet said then ananias and sapphira
[1:45:15] gospel is coming
[1:45:17] i i want to root out lord root
[1:45:19] everything out of me i want to have that
[1:45:21] spirit of david that said lord if there
[1:45:22] be any wicked way in me
[1:45:24] take that gospel plow and start plowing
[1:45:26] it out
[1:45:28] oh my that's my that's my desire
[1:45:31] i don't want to be wrong i want to be
[1:45:33] right and lord if there's
[1:45:35] something in me that that's pulling me
[1:45:37] the wrong way of
[1:45:38] to be wrong lord root it out and give me
[1:45:42] deliverance he's going to do it brothers
[1:45:44] and sisters
[1:45:46] he said they're afraid they'll bring up
[1:45:48] certain things now you i love the way
[1:45:49] brother brainer even has to say here he
[1:45:51] says now i used to blast that right out
[1:45:53] you all know that and not unless i'm
[1:45:55] actually led to do it i don't do it no
[1:45:57] more
[1:45:58] now you will make your mistakes you say
[1:46:00] i love this
[1:46:01] he says you say brother branham no
[1:46:03] matter what i'd ever do
[1:46:05] i'd never be worthy that's right but
[1:46:08] look
[1:46:08] you say brother branham at one time i
[1:46:10] didn't believe this message
[1:46:12] that's right i guess many of you didn't
[1:46:14] now listen to what he says here
[1:46:16] he says i wouldn't have done it i guess
[1:46:18] myself
[1:46:19] i couldn't have done it lest god
[1:46:21] revealed it to me
[1:46:23] see you have it's a revelation the whole
[1:46:26] church is built on revelation
[1:46:28] without revelation you'll never see it
[1:46:30] you're blind
[1:46:31] jesus the bible said i believe matthew
[1:46:33] 12 i believe it was
[1:46:35] where he said though jesus had done so
[1:46:37] many miracles before them
[1:46:38] yet they could not believe because
[1:46:40] isaiah said they got eyes and can't see
[1:46:43] ears and can't hear and very really holy
[1:46:46] people the cream of holiness
[1:46:48] so holiness is not all holy living is
[1:46:51] not all
[1:46:52] faith is the main thing now see this is
[1:46:54] the lord just struck something when i
[1:46:56] read this in my heart
[1:46:57] the signs follow the believer
[1:47:01] we've already received our of what we
[1:47:03] could call this
[1:47:04] our age sign we've received the sign
[1:47:07] of the son of man in malachi 4 come down
[1:47:10] and given us that sign
[1:47:12] and we believed that sign so now the
[1:47:15] signs
[1:47:16] follow the believers but so many times i
[1:47:19] feel
[1:47:20] and maybe this is just and lord forgive
[1:47:21] me if i'm wrong but this is
[1:47:23] at least what maybe this is just me this
[1:47:25] is the way i feel like the lord's
[1:47:26] dealing with me
[1:47:27] it's many times maybe my faith is always
[1:47:29] waiting to see another sign
[1:47:31] before we step out and grab it but he's
[1:47:34] given us the sign
[1:47:36] we've received our sign so if we could
[1:47:38] really grab a hold of the sign that he's
[1:47:41] already given
[1:47:42] the rest of the signs will follow behind
[1:47:45] because the signs follow the believer
[1:47:47] we don't have to go following the signs
[1:47:50] but once we've apprehended the sign that
[1:47:52] we've been given
[1:47:54] this message the signs were sweeping
[1:47:57] behind
[1:47:59] that's why he could say those local
[1:48:01] those by that local body has the gifts
[1:48:03] in it
[1:48:03] because when the local body when we come
[1:48:05] together in one accord
[1:48:07] one spirit just like that upper room and
[1:48:10] we can grab a hold of that sign
[1:48:12] that we've received then that tongues
[1:48:15] and prophesy might go forth tongues
[1:48:16] tongue's interpretation
[1:48:18] one could enter in and say truly god is
[1:48:20] among these people
[1:48:21] but if we're always looking for signs
[1:48:23] what happens you end up as a pentecostal
[1:48:25] church of this day
[1:48:27] i know because i was there where
[1:48:29] everybody's chasing after this side
[1:48:32] oh this gift over here let's run over
[1:48:33] here let's run over there and look for
[1:48:35] this
[1:48:36] that that's so with the true believer a
[1:48:38] true believer is anchored
[1:48:40] in jehovah anchored down strong
[1:48:43] and stands at their post of duty
[1:48:48] now we keep going on this quote he says
[1:48:50] now listen church
[1:48:51] now this is where to me it gets really
[1:48:53] good and it's already good
[1:48:55] it says now listen church i want to drop
[1:48:57] this in here because i believe the holy
[1:48:59] spirit told me to do it
[1:49:00] so if the holy spirit told him to do it
[1:49:02] how many do you want to hear it i want
[1:49:03] to hear it
[1:49:04] he says well listen i want you this is
[1:49:06] how fixed it is brothers and sisters
[1:49:10] you may be sitting there which some of
[1:49:12] you are i know you now listen this is a
[1:49:14] prophet talking
[1:49:15] so i want you to hear he's i believe
[1:49:17] brother branham in this moment it just
[1:49:19] seems like he's stepping into that
[1:49:20] prophet role and letting everybody know
[1:49:23] what the position is it's not about the
[1:49:25] man but it's the position that god gave
[1:49:27] that
[1:49:28] man to say remember he preached that
[1:49:30] message respects it's that office
[1:49:32] because that office was ordained of
[1:49:34] jesus christ to bring the people to a
[1:49:36] message
[1:49:37] so he's standing there he says he says
[1:49:39] you may be sitting there which some of
[1:49:41] you are i know you
[1:49:42] are disagreeing with me right now
[1:49:45] he says now i can call your name if you
[1:49:48] want me to
[1:49:50] now i love this says so i know that
[1:49:55] but i also can see farther than that
[1:49:59] that you're going to believe it one of
[1:50:01] these days
[1:50:03] hallelujah oh my that's how it gets me
[1:50:07] right
[1:50:08] oh my goodness i'm you know what makes
[1:50:10] me think about i'm looking i'm thinking
[1:50:11] about my family right now
[1:50:13] i can see farther than that you may not
[1:50:15] see it right now
[1:50:17] but i can see a little why because the
[1:50:19] spirit of jesus christ
[1:50:21] he says he says he says so i know that
[1:50:24] he says but i can see
[1:50:25] farther than that that you're going to
[1:50:27] believe it one of these days
[1:50:29] so i'm just going to put this in so
[1:50:31] you'll understand
[1:50:32] so i can give you a little spot of grace
[1:50:34] here when it ain't going to be too long
[1:50:36] until you're going to change your mind
[1:50:41] i'm telling you what that gives me such
[1:50:43] a such a peace
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:50] it ain't going to be too long till you
[1:50:52] change your mind
[1:50:54] some of you some of you won't but
[1:50:57] remember
[1:50:58] this is why i was talking about sarah
[1:51:00] and us
[1:51:02] think about that melchizedek but
[1:51:04] remember when sarah first heard that man
[1:51:08] which she is a type of the church when
[1:51:10] she heard that
[1:51:12] seeing the sign take place to abraham
[1:51:15] she actually laughed about it in her
[1:51:17] heart
[1:51:18] and she disbelieved and doubted it ever
[1:51:22] being so
[1:51:22] is that right at that time god would
[1:51:25] have rubbed her name right off
[1:51:27] is that right but he couldn't she's part
[1:51:31] of abraham
[1:51:32] they're one and brothers and sisters
[1:51:36] how many of you have had moments if
[1:51:38] you're honest with yourself
[1:51:40] when you've looked in the mirror of
[1:51:41] god's word because it's the only mirror
[1:51:43] we're truly looking into
[1:51:45] and you say lord there is no way
[1:51:48] in the carnal mind why because that
[1:51:50] carnal mind is always there trying to
[1:51:52] wiggle its way in even though that seed
[1:51:55] is saying
[1:51:55] yes lord the word is the only truth and
[1:51:57] that carnal mind is right there just
[1:51:59] whispering as he always is
[1:52:01] and he said no it can't happen and in
[1:52:02] that moment of weakness just like john
[1:52:04] right
[1:52:05] john in prison he said are you the
[1:52:07] christ or do we look for another
[1:52:09] it didn't change who he was he was a man
[1:52:13] subject to like passions struggling just
[1:52:15] like anybody else would in that
[1:52:16] situation
[1:52:17] in prison after you say lord i sold out
[1:52:20] everything i was eating locusts and
[1:52:21] honey
[1:52:23] i saw the messiah and here i am in
[1:52:26] prison
[1:52:28] and none of us have had the privilege of
[1:52:30] having that elevative in
[1:52:32] office and then been thrown in prison so
[1:52:34] how much more would we mean we
[1:52:36] struggle but he says
[1:52:39] he says but she disbelieved it and
[1:52:42] doubted it ever being saw
[1:52:44] and i know i've had my moments of
[1:52:46] weakness where i said lord there is no
[1:52:47] way
[1:52:49] lord this just and i love we were i was
[1:52:51] talking with
[1:52:52] our pastor here a few days ago i think
[1:52:54] right before he uh
[1:52:56] left on his trip and he had mentioned
[1:52:58] they said one surefire way he said if
[1:53:00] the devil's always telling you you're
[1:53:01] not going to make it
[1:53:03] that's a pretty good sign that you're on
[1:53:05] the right track
[1:53:07] because he's a liar i take comfort in
[1:53:10] that and what is it because
[1:53:11] it's not about you it's because you're
[1:53:15] in him
[1:53:17] because his faith was accepted christ's
[1:53:20] faith was accepted
[1:53:22] and now we are accepted in the beloved
[1:53:25] it's not about what you can do it's
[1:53:27] about what he already did
[1:53:29] all we got to do is remain in him
[1:53:34] glory to god he says
[1:53:38] and if you've really not been excited
[1:53:40] not worked up an emotion not got some
[1:53:42] church creed but really received the
[1:53:43] holy ghost
[1:53:44] and you're really part of christ and
[1:53:48] listen to this listen to this he said
[1:53:51] he's done all that you've received the
[1:53:52] holy ghost
[1:53:53] it's not just a motion you've received
[1:53:55] it he said
[1:53:56] and you're really part of christ he says
[1:54:00] and still a little skeptic in your mind
[1:54:04] that devil says oh you had a mind battle
[1:54:07] and you didn't think you were gonna make
[1:54:08] it you're definitely ain't gonna make it
[1:54:09] you ain't got the holy ghost
[1:54:11] brother brandon i'm sitting here saying
[1:54:12] even if you've got a little skeptic
[1:54:14] in your mind and you've already received
[1:54:16] it
[1:54:18] god will not shove you off from that
[1:54:21] because he can't
[1:54:25] you're a part of christ
[1:54:28] listen to this he will bring you to the
[1:54:31] truth
[1:54:34] now if you've never maybe you've spoken
[1:54:37] tongues danced in the spirit and done
[1:54:38] all these things
[1:54:39] that don't mean you got the holy ghost
[1:54:40] oh my my that's a million miles from it
[1:54:42] jesus never did say
[1:54:43] now remember i believed that you that
[1:54:45] when the holy the fullness of the holy
[1:54:47] ghost you'll speak in tongues right
[1:54:48] jesus never did there's no scripture in
[1:54:50] the bible that says
[1:54:51] that's the evidence to the holy ghost if
[1:54:53] you want to produce it
[1:54:54] if it is but there's no such scripture
[1:54:56] as that jesus said by their fruit you
[1:54:57] shall know them
[1:54:58] and the fruit of the spirit is not
[1:55:00] speaking in tongues that's a gift of the
[1:55:02] holy ghost
[1:55:03] after the holy ghost has come that's one
[1:55:04] of those gifts that goes with the
[1:55:05] preaching
[1:55:06] speaking in tongues interpretation
[1:55:08] interpretation of tongues all those
[1:55:10] things
[1:55:10] are gifts of the holy ghost but listen
[1:55:12] to that he says
[1:55:14] even if you've received the holy ghost
[1:55:15] let's just stand
[1:55:18] we're talking about identification who
[1:55:20] have you been identified with
[1:55:22] identify yourself with christ
[1:55:29] he says even if you're a little skeptic
[1:55:31] in your mind
[1:55:32] god won't shove you off of it because he
[1:55:35] can't
[1:55:36] because you're a part of him and i love
[1:55:40] he says he will bring you to the truth
[1:55:44] we ought to be the most confident
[1:55:48] and i'm not talking about arrogant
[1:55:51] there's a lot of spirit in the message
[1:55:52] that's gone over into arrogance
[1:55:55] and i think i've said it before the lord
[1:55:56] kind of gave me this years ago i call it
[1:55:58] bride pride
[1:55:59] i'm bride i'm bright i'm bride but i
[1:56:01] always thought about the the story
[1:56:02] brother branham told about the slave
[1:56:04] that was the son of a king he didn't
[1:56:06] have to tell anybody who he was
[1:56:08] it was the life that he led that
[1:56:10] expressed
[1:56:11] that nature that was already in him
[1:56:14] wasn't anything he had to put on
[1:56:16] and don't you worry your bride of christ
[1:56:19] the lord you've identified yourself with
[1:56:21] him he'll identify himself with you
[1:56:24] because he has to he can't deny himself
[1:56:28] sarah laughed within her heart
[1:56:31] he couldn't wipe her out because she was
[1:56:32] part of him
[1:56:34] you you and right now you know what you
[1:56:35] may have had your struggles you may be
[1:56:37] even struggling now
[1:56:38] the devil whispering in your ear all
[1:56:40] your faults and your failures but don't
[1:56:42] worry you're part of him
[1:56:44] and you just keep pressing just like
[1:56:45] abraham you know abraham went down to
[1:56:48] egypt
[1:56:48] two different times
[1:56:52] and egypt is the type of the world we
[1:56:54] know that went down there
[1:56:56] sojourning just trying to find his way
[1:56:59] but he came back you know it didn't stop
[1:57:00] the promise from coming to pass
[1:57:02] abraham's sarah sarah's laughing in her
[1:57:05] heart didn't stop
[1:57:07] in fact god puts her in the hall of fame
[1:57:10] when says she counted him faithful that
[1:57:12] promised
[1:57:13] praise the lord he'll that we've counted
[1:57:15] him faithful
[1:57:17] have you counted him faithful ah he's
[1:57:20] been so faithful to me
[1:57:23] he's been beyond faithful to me
[1:57:26] when he should have cast me off he drew
[1:57:28] me back by bands of love
[1:57:31] when i should have been a castaway even
[1:57:34] just like paul would say he said though
[1:57:35] i was chief of sinners
[1:57:37] and then standing by and watching the
[1:57:39] the persecution of the church and yet
[1:57:41] god would call him out
[1:57:45] praise the lord thank the lord for his
[1:57:48] grace
[1:57:49] thank the lord for his his sure word of
[1:57:52] prophecy for this hour
[1:57:55] oh my let's just bow our heads into a
[1:57:58] word of prayer
[1:58:03] let's just leave our heads bowed this
[1:58:04] evening
[1:58:07] and just asked the question
[1:58:11] maybe you haven't received that
[1:58:15] sure word in your own heart the
[1:58:17] scripture says
[1:58:18] to make your calling in election sure
[1:58:22] but maybe the devil's been fighting you
[1:58:24] with doubts in your mind
[1:58:26] and thoughts and
[1:58:29] different ideas and different polls from
[1:58:31] different places all around how the
[1:58:33] world has so many different
[1:58:34] spirits our prophet even taught us that
[1:58:36] it believes two hundred thousand
[1:58:38] thousand demons
[1:58:39] reese loose from the river euphrates
[1:58:42] i believe in one place even called those
[1:58:43] ancient demons
[1:58:46] antediluvian devils that would come out
[1:58:49] to try to
[1:58:50] and and attack the bride of christ
[1:58:53] we're in a battle brothers and sisters
[1:58:56] but the lord's given a more sure word of
[1:58:59] prophecy in this hour
[1:59:02] but maybe you've had questions and maybe
[1:59:05] just say lord
[1:59:06] i want to be more sure lord maybe
[1:59:09] as as the one had said to jesus even
[1:59:11] lord i believe but help my unbelief
[1:59:15] lord may you just go and if there's
[1:59:18] one that would have that desire you just
[1:59:20] raise your hand and say lord
[1:59:22] help my unbelief when i've gotten down
[1:59:25] into those places where
[1:59:27] i feel like john in prison i look around
[1:59:29] and there's just bars everywhere lord i
[1:59:30] tried to do the best i could but it
[1:59:32] seemed like i ended up in this place
[1:59:34] anyway
[1:59:35] lord have i have i even believed on the
[1:59:37] right thing
[1:59:39] may the holy ghost speak to your heart
[1:59:41] and say what is this word done
[1:59:44] it's brought a more sure word of
[1:59:46] prophecy in this hour
[1:59:48] it's revealed the word of god to you
[1:59:52] lord may you give us the vision lord
[1:59:55] where you said that the spirit of jesus
[1:59:57] christ is the spirit of prophecy
[1:59:59] to have those eagle eyes to be able to
[2:00:01] see even as the prophet said
[2:00:03] he could see a far farther off
[2:00:06] maybe you don't believe it now or maybe
[2:00:07] you have family that don't believe it
[2:00:09] now
[2:00:10] but we could see by faith that they're
[2:00:12] on their way
[2:00:15] i have my hand up lord help my unbelief
[2:00:17] wherever it might be
[2:00:18] lord if there's any doors in my heart
[2:00:20] that i've closed off to you may you just
