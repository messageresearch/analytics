[20:01] just speaking
[20:05] [Music]
[20:25] there's power in the word that you can
[20:26] speak this evening
[20:28] [Music]
[20:29] maybe as we go before the lord
[20:32] we just start to meditate upon
[20:34] the words that we've heard
[20:37] this morning and what god has made us in
[20:39] him
[20:41] there is a power
[20:44] in the bride of jesus christ in the end
[20:46] time to speak the word
[20:50] and you can have a faith in what you
[20:52] speak because if your heart is aligned
[20:54] with the word of god and your desires
[20:56] according to the word
[20:58] then you can have what you ask
[21:00] [Music]
[21:01] i believe it's
[21:03] the desire of god that your family would
[21:06] be sealed
[21:08] you start thinking about that loved one
[21:10] or that one that's sick and
[21:12] whatever it is on your heart god is
[21:14] wanting to use you to be that vehicle to
[21:17] bring forth his word to pass
[21:20] let's just go before him heavenly father
[21:23] we love you with all of our heart lord
[21:25] because you first loved us
[21:28] we're thankful lord that
[21:30] you've provided us a little place to
[21:32] gather together and we have such
[21:34] wonderful brothers and sisters a
[21:36] precious like faith that
[21:38] we can sing the songs of zion and be
[21:40] able to worship you lord in
[21:42] spirit and in truth and now as we come
[21:45] to the preaching of the word lord
[21:47] [Music]
[21:48] i know there's nothing to myself that i
[21:50] could do
[21:51] but lord we invite you to come
[21:54] lord that you would be the one to turn
[21:55] the pages and break the bread of life to
[21:58] your people
[21:59] we're needy tonight lord we know that
[22:03] we have a long ways to go but we're
[22:04] thankful that you've brought us a long
[22:06] ways
[22:08] we're thankful that we're in your hands
[22:10] lord
[22:10] so we just commit this service to you
[22:12] the people the preaching of the word and
[22:14] ask all these things in the name of the
[22:16] lord jesus christ
[22:17] amen praise the lord
[22:19] you'll turn in your bibles to mark
[22:21] chapter
[22:28] chapter 11 verse 20.
[22:32] and as you're turning there uh we just
[22:34] want to remember our pastor in prayer
[22:36] um
[22:38] he's not feeling well he's in the back
[22:40] uh taking in the service but
[22:42] i just remember him in prayer
[22:45] amen we'll be
[22:47] reading uh
[22:49] mark
[22:50] 11
[22:51] verse 20 through 25.
[22:56] amen
[22:57] how's everybody feeling
[23:00] tired
[23:03] those things seem to happen after a big
[23:04] weekend but
[23:06] by the grace of god we can just enter
[23:07] into his presence for a little bit and
[23:11] feast on the word of god
[23:15] mark 11 verse 20
[23:18] says and in the morning as they passed
[23:20] by and saw the fig tree dried up from
[23:22] the roots
[23:25] and peter calling to remembrance saith
[23:27] unto him master behold the fig tree
[23:29] which thou curseth is withered away
[23:32] and jesus answered and saith unto him
[23:34] have faith in god
[23:37] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[23:39] shall say unto this mountain
[23:42] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[23:44] the sea
[23:45] and shall not doubt in his heart
[23:47] but shall believe that those things
[23:50] which he saith shall come to pass
[23:53] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[23:56] therefore i say unto you
[24:00] why don't you go ahead and put your name
[24:02] in that as we read that again god is
[24:03] speaking to somebody tonight
[24:06] therefore i say unto matthew
[24:09] what things so ever ye desire when you
[24:12] pray believe that ye receive them
[24:15] and ye shall have them and when you
[24:17] stand praying forgive if you have ought
[24:19] against any
[24:21] that your father also which is in heaven
[24:23] may forgive you your trespasses amen we
[24:26] just ask a blessing upon the reading of
[24:28] the word you may be seated
[24:32] man i just want to speak to you
[24:34] uh this evening maybe if we're just to
[24:36] carry along the same lines of what we
[24:38] spoke a few services ago to you on have
[24:42] faith and what you are
[24:44] and as a subject i'd i would like to
[24:47] um
[24:48] maybe have a subject accepting
[24:50] god's challenge
[24:52] and
[24:53] by god's grace if we get to that part
[24:55] but i want to read this out of perfect
[24:57] faith
[24:58] it says now faith is based on
[25:00] forgiveness
[25:02] then and
[25:03] we said this morning trying to get the
[25:05] church into the place to where we could
[25:08] really see apostolic times moving among
[25:10] us
[25:12] that's what we all hunger amen is that
[25:14] your heart's desires to see apostolic
[25:16] times moving amongst us that is what we
[25:19] all hunger and it's just laying right at
[25:21] the door we see it but we want to see
[25:23] more of it we want to see
[25:25] it such a flow it'll be a help to us us
[25:29] flow out to others remember jesus
[25:32] as we had a lesson this morning he never
[25:36] used his power for himself he used it
[25:39] for others that's what it was sent for
[25:47] just reading that portion again jesus he
[25:49] never used his power for himself he used
[25:52] it for others that's what it was sent
[25:54] for if if if that's what jesus power was
[25:57] for others then we should know that in
[25:59] our own selves as we've received the
[26:01] holy ghost and the power that is laying
[26:03] within the believer it's not just for
[26:05] ourselves to live an overcoming life but
[26:08] god has has placed something inside of
[26:10] you
[26:11] that could be used for others and last
[26:13] time as we spoke we we spoke about
[26:15] advancing our borders and going after
[26:17] lost loved ones and and seeking lost
[26:20] souls and using the power of god in your
[26:22] life for the benefit of others
[26:25] amen do you do you believe god can do
[26:27] that in the individual do you believe
[26:29] that that's god's desire god wants to
[26:31] use you he wants to use your life to go
[26:34] after others and to have an effect
[26:36] and as i thought about that i was
[26:38] reminded about that story brother
[26:40] branham tells how how they during one of
[26:42] the meetings there was a young mother
[26:44] and she had her baby and the baby just
[26:46] kept uh fussing and it couldn't quiet
[26:48] down and she knew something was wrong
[26:50] and and there was this uh older mother
[26:52] there and she she saw this young one and
[26:55] and saw the struggle and something came
[26:56] upon her heart and she said you know i
[26:58] just want to go pray for the baby
[27:01] but see something in her heart kept
[27:02] telling her who am i to do that
[27:05] she's like my she she has a prayer card
[27:08] and and she's going to go up and have
[27:10] the prophet pray for who who is little
[27:13] old significant me that i would go pray
[27:15] for this baby uh when she has the
[27:17] opportunity to stand before the prophet
[27:19] and and she just kind of she she kind of
[27:22] quenched the still small voice
[27:24] has anybody ever quenched the still
[27:26] small voice god is putting something on
[27:28] your heart something that god is wanting
[27:31] you to do he's trying to move you a
[27:32] certain direction but what do you do you
[27:34] start to reason within yourself is that
[27:37] really the voice of god to me is is that
[27:39] really what god wants me to do and you
[27:41] start to wonder and then you start to
[27:43] think of your how insignificant you are
[27:45] in your abilities and who am i to be
[27:47] able to say or to do something like that
[27:50] and before you know it if you're not
[27:51] careful you let that opportunity pass
[27:53] you by but but god here put that burden
[27:57] back on this mother's heart and she said
[27:58] you know i just can't get away from it i
[28:00] i i just go over to her and i tell you a
[28:03] lot of times it's in the approach if you
[28:05] could just find the right approach she
[28:06] she found in her heart the way that she
[28:08] could approach this young mother and she
[28:10] came to her and said oh you look i know
[28:12] that that you you may have a prayer card
[28:14] and the prophet is going to pray for you
[28:16] but if you could just for my sake too
[28:18] just to appease this burden that i feel
[28:20] upon my heart that i might be able to
[28:22] pray for your baby and the young mother
[28:24] said oh sure
[28:26] that would be wonderful go ahead and
[28:28] pray for the baby and and as the story
[28:30] goes this young mother now she's going
[28:32] through the prayer line and as she's
[28:34] going through the prayer line also the
[28:35] prophet goes into a vision and he says
[28:38] look that baby i see you were standing
[28:40] up there and there was another mother
[28:42] there and she saw the condition of the
[28:44] child and there was something on her
[28:46] heart god put a desire on her heart to
[28:48] pray for that baby and when she prayed
[28:50] for that baby your baby was healed look
[28:53] uh no doubt that if that woman wouldn't
[28:56] have heeded the call of god for her to
[28:58] go through that baby i believe the
[28:59] permissive will would have been because
[29:01] it's god's will that we are healed it's
[29:03] god's word that we are healed by his
[29:06] stripes we are healed but god wanted to
[29:08] use that woman god wanted to use that
[29:10] mother as the vehicle to bring the word
[29:13] into manifestation and she surrendered
[29:15] to the still small voice and she carried
[29:18] out the word of god and it took a profit
[29:20] there to stand there in a vision and say
[29:22] look this one she was obedient to the
[29:25] still small voice and she prayed for
[29:27] that baby and that baby is healed i
[29:30] don't need to pray for that baby it's
[29:32] already healed do you believe god can do
[29:33] that with you in your life if you'd
[29:35] become conscious of the still small
[29:38] voice and who you are and what god made
[29:40] you that's what we want to speak about a
[29:42] little bit tonight is who you are what
[29:44] god made you we want to have faith in
[29:47] what we are in the promises of god and
[29:49] what he's made the bride of jesus christ
[29:51] in the end time that we have the power
[29:52] of the spoken word that we can take god
[29:55] at his word we can go out and lay hands
[29:57] on the sick and they shall recover
[30:00] well i know i get excited and i get
[30:02] amped up and i scream a little bit but
[30:04] look past the veil a little bit let's
[30:05] let god speak to our heart tonight that
[30:08] helps me maybe to get past my
[30:09] insecurities and my inabilities and
[30:12] things like that i know i might say that
[30:13] a lot but oh we're not here just to play
[30:15] church tonight we're here to enter into
[30:17] the presence of god we're here to look
[30:18] past the veil this evening
[30:20] we're here to look god in his face and
[30:23] look into the book and see the pages
[30:25] opened up to us that we might realize
[30:27] who we are in christ jesus that we can
[30:30] do the greater works that we can't speak
[30:32] the word that we can't say to this
[30:34] mountain it shall be moved
[30:36] oh glory to god there's a perfect faith
[30:39] that is rising up in the believer in the
[30:41] end time by the spoken word of god that
[30:43] has been unveiled by the prophet of the
[30:45] hour oh he goes on to say in perfect
[30:48] faith he says you're a christian
[30:50] you have a right to any redemptive
[30:52] blessing that jesus died for
[30:56] it's all yours
[31:03] it's all yours
[31:05] is it too loud for y'all out there
[31:08] is it perfect for me up here
[31:10] i can hear myself
[31:14] it's all yours
[31:17] it's already paid for
[31:20] you just have to believe it
[31:23] not imagine it
[31:25] but believe it and know that it is yours
[31:29] and you can possess it oh
[31:31] that's conquering faith no
[31:34] oh my jesus said destroy this tabernacle
[31:38] and i'll raise it up in three days
[31:40] because there was a prophecy under jonah
[31:43] as jonah was in the belly of the well
[31:45] for three days jesus christ knew who he
[31:48] was so he could speak the word knowing
[31:50] who he was and that's exactly
[31:53] where the bride of jesus christ is in
[31:55] the end time we know who we are because
[31:58] a vindicated prophet has come
[32:00] the son of man has been revealed and
[32:02] he's spoken words of life into the bride
[32:04] of jesus christ and she's told you who
[32:07] you are then if you know who you are can
[32:10] you not speak the word concerning
[32:12] yourself
[32:14] come on now so many times we're afraid
[32:17] and we shrink back to speak the very
[32:20] words that was spoken to you i think of
[32:22] abraham
[32:24] the father of our faith god spoke to
[32:26] abraham and he said you're going to have
[32:28] a son and in the face of all obstacles
[32:31] in the face of his disability and in no
[32:34] ability within himself to bring forth
[32:36] the promise abraham the father of faith
[32:39] stood right there and said i'm going to
[32:40] have a son why because it wasn't
[32:43] abraham's word it wasn't what abraham
[32:46] can do it was what god told abraham how
[32:49] much more can the bride of jesus christ
[32:51] stand here and declare the words that
[32:54] we've heard by a vindicated prophet when
[32:56] he stood there and and unveiled the
[32:59] mighty god unveiled before us proving he
[33:01] was the same yesterday today and forever
[33:04] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[33:06] the heart and he would stand there and
[33:07] tell you you never did it in the first
[33:10] place you are justified oh i tell you
[33:12] you can stand with the revelation
[33:14] tonight and know that you are the
[33:16] sinless virtuous bride of jesus christ
[33:19] not because of any ability you have not
[33:21] because of something that you've done
[33:23] but because god said so and he did more
[33:25] than saying it he vindicated it and he
[33:28] proved it he come down and became a
[33:30] kinsmen redeemer and he took all of your
[33:33] sins to calvary it is finished why can't
[33:37] we stand up then and declare what christ
[33:39] has done for you
[33:41] oh come on there ought to be a liberty
[33:43] in the house of god to set you free from
[33:46] all the condemnation set you free from
[33:48] the things that you're palin set you
[33:50] free from your inabilities and the times
[33:52] you've fallen and you failed time and
[33:54] time again and you've got all this
[33:56] condemnation heaped up in your life and
[33:58] you're just wondering if you're ever
[33:59] gonna make it oh why don't you say what
[34:01] the word says god said you're gonna make
[34:04] it you're going to make it you're an
[34:06] overcomer you're the very manifested
[34:08] word of the hour why don't you have
[34:10] faith in what god has made you
[34:13] oh hallelujah i get excited about that
[34:16] because i know what i was i know what i
[34:18] was capable of i know the sins that i
[34:20] used to do i know how bad it was for me
[34:22] oh i didn't have a chance in the world
[34:25] everybody counted me out or even my own
[34:27] family could have counted me how they
[34:29] tried to kick me out they tried to do it
[34:31] because they knew something was wrong oh
[34:33] but god didn't count me out god knew
[34:36] that i'd place something on the inside
[34:38] of the man that it was his own seed a
[34:41] gene seed of god that it would never
[34:42] fall it would never fail because it was
[34:45] a part of god himself
[34:48] oh praise god when you get a revelation
[34:50] of that
[34:52] oh let all hell rage
[34:54] let the trials come let the persecution
[34:57] come let all the faults and failures be
[34:59] brought up before you you'll be like
[35:01] that woman at the well said come see a
[35:02] man
[35:04] yeah i might have made a lot of bad
[35:05] decisions i made it i might have done a
[35:07] lot of bad things but come see a man who
[35:09] discerned the thoughts and intents of my
[35:11] heart oh he told me where i come from he
[35:13] told me where i'm going he told me all
[35:16] about it and i am so free i'm so
[35:19] delivered oh come see in the hand who
[35:21] told me where i came from come see a man
[35:24] that told me where i'm going come see a
[35:26] man that told me i am not defeated i am
[35:29] an overcomer that i am victorious that
[35:32] i'm part of the word of god i'm bone of
[35:34] his bone and flesh of the flesh oh come
[35:37] see a man who's told me all about it
[35:40] oh hallelujah oh that ought to stir up a
[35:43] victory in the heart that'll stir up a
[35:46] shout in the camp of the living god
[35:48] tonight to know who you are
[35:52] oh but we have such a problem of having
[35:54] faith in that
[35:57] we were so challenged in our mind in the
[35:59] carnal mind and all of the reasoning
[36:03] but we want to move into a perfect faith
[36:08] jesus could say that about himself
[36:11] because he knew who he was
[36:14] he would say the prophet of god would go
[36:16] on to say he knew it would happen
[36:19] before he could predict
[36:21] that it would happen because he knowed
[36:23] it would happen
[36:25] and whatever he predicted come to pass
[36:28] now why because
[36:29] christ knew who he was
[36:32] so then he could speak the word and
[36:34] knowing who he was that he was a messiah
[36:38] how much more can the bride of christ
[36:39] speak i can say hey i'm going in a
[36:41] rapture
[36:43] i i'm going to be changed
[36:45] this mortal body is going to be changed
[36:48] and going to put on perfection you can
[36:50] stand there with a sure confidence by
[36:52] revelation and speak the word concerning
[36:54] yourself because it's thus saith the
[36:56] lord you don't have to wonder about it
[36:58] you don't have to worry you don't have
[37:00] to guess if you're going to manifest it
[37:02] no you're going to manifest it because
[37:04] it's the spoken word of god that's why
[37:06] we don't fear death we don't fear
[37:08] sickness we don't fear any of the things
[37:10] that come upon the believer because the
[37:12] only thing that it's doing is it's it's
[37:14] giving you character it's giving you a
[37:16] gold that's tried and fire so when the
[37:19] sicknesses come and the persecution
[37:20] comes that's why the believer can joy
[37:23] hallelujah he can joy in the midst of
[37:25] his trial he can joy in the infirmities
[37:28] when the devil's pouring it on oh a
[37:30] believer knows where he's standing
[37:32] because he knows who he is and say oh if
[37:34] i lose my loved ones if those that go
[37:37] from around me if i don't see the
[37:39] manifestation of my healing in this
[37:41] natural party if i go by the way of the
[37:44] grave there's a perfect healing for me
[37:46] because i know when this tabernacle is
[37:48] dissolved i already have another body
[37:50] waiting for me put me in the grave
[37:52] scatter me out over the ocean i don't
[37:54] care what you do i'm going in a rapture
[37:57] i'm going in the resurrection if i go by
[37:59] way of the grave or if i'm standing on
[38:01] this earth and the dead in christ are
[38:02] raised first one thing i can tell you i
[38:05] can stand here and declare to you i am
[38:07] going in a rapture
[38:10] i don't have to doubt it i don't have to
[38:12] fear it i don't have to wonder if it's
[38:13] going to pass it shall come to pass
[38:19] just as jesus could stand there and say
[38:23] destroy this temple and in three days
[38:25] i'll raise it up again
[38:28] now watch whatever he said
[38:32] god honored what he said think of that
[38:34] whatever jesus said
[38:36] god brought it to pass
[38:39] so he knowed his words were god's words
[38:51] he knowed god's words
[38:57] he knowed his words were god's words now
[38:59] look the same scripture comes right back
[39:01] into us again
[39:04] all right come on now
[39:06] oh hallelujah
[39:08] look that same scripture comes right
[39:11] back into us again
[39:12] if you say to this mountain oh no no we
[39:16] we we always can recognize the word and
[39:18] the prophet
[39:19] we can always recognize the word and
[39:21] brother branham we can always recognize
[39:24] the word in peter and john we could
[39:27] always recognize the word and abraham
[39:30] and elijah and even in the hebrew
[39:32] children oh we can look into all the
[39:34] patriarchs and we can always see the
[39:37] word in them but when it comes to that
[39:39] word which was christ which was god
[39:42] himself and abraham it was god in the
[39:44] hebrew children it was god and elijah it
[39:47] was john and john the baptist and jesus
[39:50] christ was the fullness of the godhead
[39:52] bodily and all that he poured into
[39:54] christ he poured out into the church
[39:56] then i say when that holy ghost has come
[39:59] to that predestinated seed of god then
[40:01] it's god in you
[40:04] oh if you say to this mountain
[40:08] that same scripture comes right back
[40:10] into us again if you say to this
[40:12] mountain oh my now when the same god
[40:14] comes to you
[40:17] and is pleased to dwell in you
[40:24] okay brother matthew you're going a
[40:25] little too far i i can't accept that
[40:28] if you only knew
[40:30] my faults and my failures and how many
[40:31] times i've tried to follow this message
[40:34] no let's get our eyes off the cardinal
[40:36] now let's put our spiritual thinking cap
[40:39] on
[40:40] this is we we're not playing church this
[40:42] isn't brother matthew's words this is it
[40:45] this isn't a man speaking to you oh but
[40:47] if by faith you can catch that god
[40:50] himself is speaking to the predestinated
[40:53] seed that he planted to receive the very
[40:56] spoken word that he spoke
[40:58] whoo
[41:00] now when the same god comes to you and
[41:02] is pleased to dwell in you please to
[41:03] honor your word
[41:05] what your decision is
[41:10] what was joshua's decision
[41:12] stand still son
[41:14] and it stood there amen sure what was
[41:17] moses decision held his stick over the
[41:20] river like that then called for it to
[41:22] open and it opened seat whatever you ask
[41:25] and if you say to this mountain be moved
[41:28] and don't doubt see in your heart but
[41:31] believe that you'll have
[41:33] what you said will come to pass you can
[41:35] have what you said that puts you back in
[41:39] the word
[41:41] now that's not some skim milk there see
[41:45] that puts you back in the word look the
[41:48] prophet of god said real genuine faith
[41:51] will catch that this this promise puts
[41:53] you back in the word well if you are in
[41:56] the word what you are the gene seed of
[41:58] god you are the word why does it put you
[42:01] back in the word because you are the
[42:03] word so when you hear the word what
[42:05] faith cometh by hearing the word then if
[42:08] he said it it's producing a perfect
[42:10] faith and the believer to take the word
[42:13] and manifest it oh don't shrink short of
[42:15] that look if joshua could stand there
[42:18] and say son be still if if moses could
[42:21] stand there and say be still and know of
[42:24] the the the that i am god in the waves
[42:27] and the ocean would open up god is
[42:29] trying to bring us to a perfect faith in
[42:31] this hour by the opening of the word and
[42:33] the third pool that is now in the bride
[42:36] that you have the power of the spoken
[42:38] word what did the prophet of god say and
[42:40] looked away to jesus in december 12 29
[42:43] he said look i now know what the third
[42:44] pull is and i know what it does i want
[42:47] to tell you that the opening of the word
[42:49] does something
[42:52] it goes into action it goes and uses its
[42:55] power for others
[42:59] look we are the final voice to the final
[43:01] generation where is the voice of god now
[43:04] oh no no no no don't don't don't don't
[43:06] lose me now
[43:09] but where is the voice of god if god is
[43:11] in you is greater than
[43:13] is he that is in you then he that is in
[43:15] the world if god is veiling himself in
[43:17] the bride then i want to ask you who
[43:19] should it be that is speaking through
[43:21] you it should be none other than god it
[43:23] should be god's voice that is speaking
[43:25] it should be god's hands that are
[43:26] reacting it should be god's feet that
[43:28] are walking god wants to use your body
[43:31] just as he would call a couple brothers
[43:33] in our church to go down to the hospital
[43:35] and say a prayer what was it it was god
[43:38] and two disciples going on down the road
[43:41] to walk into a hospital and by divine
[43:43] promise and say look if we lay hands on
[43:46] the sick they shall recover that's not a
[43:48] man's word and that wasn't a man's will
[43:50] that was the will of god and it was god
[43:52] in the man and god will back up his
[43:54] promised word every time if you have
[43:57] faith in who you are you can stand upon
[43:59] the word of god and you can speak the
[44:01] word and god is duty-bound to back it up
[44:04] every single time i'll stand and declare
[44:06] the gospel if you lay hands on the sick
[44:09] they shall recover try god i want to
[44:11] tell you he is not a liar and if you
[44:13] have had hands laid on and you're
[44:15] believing to be healed i want to tell
[44:17] you thus say the lord you are healed i
[44:20] have authority by the divine word of the
[44:22] hour to tell you why because the word
[44:25] says it
[44:27] oh brother matthew what are you talking
[44:30] about even the prophet didn't do it well
[44:31] i know i'm not trying to get fanatical
[44:33] and go out there i understand in this
[44:35] mortal realm that we get sick in our
[44:37] body but god allows sickness to come
[44:39] that he can prove that he's a healer
[44:42] he wants to express those attributes uh
[44:44] so beautifully our pastor going through
[44:46] those things look god god allows these
[44:47] things to happen and because we don't
[44:50] see it manifested the way we think of
[44:52] does not change god's program
[44:56] that's where we get ourselves in trouble
[44:57] is because we get into how we believe it
[45:00] should
[45:02] happen your duty bound to the word of
[45:05] god and if god puts it in your heart you
[45:07] speak the word and let it be according
[45:09] to the word that you've spoken because
[45:10] it's not your words it's not your words
[45:12] it's his word every time the prophet of
[45:14] god would talk about the third poll and
[45:15] he would say uh it wasn't what i spoke
[45:18] it was what he spoke he said let it be
[45:20] squirrels and you would say he spoke it
[45:22] every single time and you look how you
[45:23] go well what do you mean brother random
[45:25] you keep saying you're the one that
[45:26] spoke it but but but you you said it but
[45:29] but every time you refer back to it you
[45:30] say
[45:31] you said it was he that said it why
[45:33] because there's a union it's a uniting
[45:36] time where the bride and jesus christ
[45:38] are becoming one and if the pride is
[45:40] saying it christ is saying it if christ
[45:43] is saying it the pride is saying it why
[45:45] because they become one flesh they have
[45:47] the same mind they have the mind of the
[45:49] word of god let this mind pee in you
[45:51] which was also in christ jesus the
[45:53] spirit and the pride say come oh i say
[45:56] there ought to be a cry in the heart of
[45:58] the pride of jesus christ in the end
[45:59] time that are saying come oh why don't
[46:01] you come gather around the carcass of
[46:03] god's word where the eagles are gathered
[46:06] oh why don't you feast upon the body
[46:07] where's son of man there has been a word
[46:09] that has opened up that we should be
[46:11] inviting some to come and feast upon the
[46:13] word of the hour
[46:17] oh
[46:18] well i live for it
[46:21] hallelujah
[46:23] oh god help us
[46:25] help us lord jesus
[46:29] oh that same god comes
[46:31] to you and is pleased
[46:33] to dwell in you
[46:34] please to honor your word
[46:38] that's not skim milk
[46:40] please to honor your word what your
[46:42] decision is
[46:44] think about that
[46:47] what your decision is i believe there's
[46:48] a place
[46:50] that we can come to where we're so died
[46:52] out to our own thoughts and died out to
[46:54] our own ideas to where our thinking is
[46:56] his thinking where thy word have i hid
[46:59] in my heart you're meditating upon the
[47:01] word day and night you're listening to
[47:03] the prophet's message you're reading the
[47:05] message books looking as you're feeding
[47:08] upon that word and those thoughts look
[47:10] that that's you know the the the your
[47:12] mind is the womb of the spirit why do
[47:15] you think many times we manifest uh uh
[47:18] things when sin is conceived what
[47:20] happens when you start to to entertain
[47:22] the things of the world and you start to
[47:25] look at the things of the world and the
[47:26] internet and and all the all that i
[47:29] don't want to go down that route but you
[47:30] know all the entertainment and the and
[47:32] the social platforms and the tech talks
[47:34] and the the instagrams and all those
[47:36] things look if if you're constantly
[47:39] feeding on those things then it's going
[47:40] to produce fruits because those things
[47:42] are constantly sowing seeds and then you
[47:45] wonder why you get into a test or into a
[47:47] trial and you fail to overcome it it's
[47:50] because you haven't been feeding on the
[47:51] word which is your strength and you find
[47:53] out why have i found my place in a
[47:56] weakness where all of a sudden you're
[47:57] scrolling on the internet or you're
[47:59] doing something and you find that your
[48:01] fingers are faster than your mind and
[48:03] you're like why did i even click on that
[48:05] and now you feel defiled and you're
[48:06] wondering why in the world did i give in
[48:08] to that and you're feeling defeated well
[48:10] all you have to do is plead the blood of
[48:12] jesus christ and say satan you got me
[48:14] there i give you that one but i ain't
[48:16] gonna let it happen again i'm going to
[48:18] plead the blood of jesus christ and if
[48:20] he set a trap for me are you fooled me
[48:22] that time but i'm going to gird up the
[48:24] loids of my mind now i'm going to
[48:25] refrain from going into those traps of
[48:28] the devil i'm going to start reading my
[48:30] bible i'm going to start staying away
[48:32] from the things of the world because if
[48:34] i'm feeding on the word of god and
[48:36] planting the seeds of the word into my
[48:38] mind i know that as it's watered it will
[48:40] drop down into my heart and i will
[48:43] produce a perfect faith in me to produce
[48:45] the word no longer producing the things
[48:47] of the world no longer producing the
[48:49] lust of the flesh but now you're
[48:51] producing the fruits of the spirit in
[48:53] your life because you're feeding on the
[48:55] word and faith comes by hearing that
[48:56] word and now that that word has found
[48:59] fertile ground it can spring forth the
[49:01] newness of life and produce none other
[49:03] than jesus christ and flesh again
[49:06] oh hallelujah
[49:08] oh that our decisions he would be
[49:10] pleased with our decisions
[49:13] hallelujah stand still son oh real
[49:16] genuine faith catches that
[49:19] that puts you back in the word
[49:22] oh hallelujah i want to read this quote
[49:24] here we this was our
[49:27] uh just really the crux of our
[49:28] inspiration he says
[49:31] speaking of jesus
[49:33] paragraph 64 perfect faith he said he
[49:35] relied in knowing
[49:37] that he was the word
[49:38] and he had faith in god who made him the
[49:41] word
[49:43] he was god the word
[49:45] and they was in him and he gave he and
[49:48] that give him faith
[49:50] because he understood his position
[49:53] he knowed what he was because the
[49:56] scripture had said he was this and here
[50:00] every scripture tied in to prove that he
[50:03] was exactly what the scripture said he
[50:05] would be and he knew what he was
[50:12] all right we we all we all can accept
[50:14] that
[50:16] now let god speak to you
[50:19] therefore he relied upon what god had
[50:22] made him
[50:24] and if he did that
[50:26] then can't we rely upon what god made us
[50:30] as believers
[50:33] these signs shall follow them that
[50:35] believe
[50:36] he had faith in what he was and if you
[50:39] are a believer you have faith in what
[50:42] you are you are a believer
[50:46] now look at our text here he says here
[50:48] in our text he says uh who is he
[50:51] speaking to when he says if you say to
[50:53] this mountain
[50:54] this ain't a blanket statement for all
[50:56] christianity and just whosoever will
[50:59] like you think
[51:00] no god is speaking to a special class of
[51:04] people
[51:05] he is speaking to an elect lady he's
[51:07] speaking to the bride of jesus christ
[51:09] he's speaking to a group that in the
[51:11] face of all adversity in the face of all
[51:15] uh all trial and tribulation that will
[51:17] stand upon the promised word no matter
[51:20] what comes their way and they'll say
[51:21] what the word says
[51:24] oh well you know you you you you stood
[51:26] up and you testified that that you were
[51:28] healed and you're having the same
[51:30] symptoms that you said you were
[51:31] delivered from
[51:33] oh he starts to war against your mind oh
[51:35] you got back from camp and you testified
[51:37] and look how many times that you've
[51:38] fallen since you've gotten back from
[51:40] camp
[51:41] well okay
[51:42] maybe he's right he's the one that set
[51:43] the trap
[51:45] that's what hunters do they go out and
[51:47] set a trap and you know what they do
[51:48] they go check it
[51:51] the devil got all these traps set up
[51:53] everywhere you can turn and look in
[51:55] school work internet your complexes your
[51:59] personality at church in the parking lot
[52:02] in the parking spot you gotta break you
[52:04] gotta park down at the baptist church
[52:06] and i just can't believe this there's
[52:08] traps that are set up in your mind and
[52:10] trust me the devil's going around and
[52:12] checking his traps to see if you fell
[52:14] into one of them because he wants to
[52:16] become a snare to you and he wants to
[52:18] keep you from making it into the house
[52:19] of god he wants to keep you from coming
[52:22] into the what the word spoke that you
[52:23] were because you're more than a
[52:25] conqueror in jesus christ you are an
[52:28] overcomer i want to ask you what are you
[52:30] overcoming you're overcoming satan's
[52:32] eden you're overcoming every single trap
[52:35] you're overcoming every single trip to a
[52:37] trick you're overcoming every single
[52:39] demon all those demons that were loosed
[52:41] at the river euphrates have now directed
[52:44] their their guns toward the bride of
[52:46] jesus christ and that's what you are
[52:48] overcoming but i want to tell it it's
[52:49] not you in your own self that's
[52:52] overcoming it it's christ that is in you
[52:54] and the devil is trying to set snares
[52:56] and traps to keep you from coming into
[52:59] the potential that god has spoke you to
[53:01] be because once you do that you will be
[53:04] a mighty invincible army you'll draw
[53:07] that sword and say where is that devil
[53:09] i'm going after my brother i'm going
[53:11] after my sister where is the sick let me
[53:14] lay hands on them they shall recover i'm
[53:17] going to use the power that god has
[53:19] placed to me that holy ghost power which
[53:22] is none other than the life of jesus
[53:23] christ and i'm going to battle where is
[53:26] my lost sons where is my lost daughters
[53:28] where is the prodigals oh glory to god
[53:31] i'm telling you what i feel like
[53:33] fighting a fight i i feel like drawing
[53:35] my sword i feel like doing battle who's
[53:38] with me who's on the lower side who
[53:40] wants to go get our prodigals who wants
[53:42] to go get the sons and the daughters of
[53:44] believing moms and dads in this building
[53:46] and say devil you can't have them i'm
[53:48] going after them i'm gonna get on my
[53:50] knees i'm gonna get into prayer i'm
[53:52] gonna get on the airplane i'm gonna do
[53:54] whatever i can do why because just like
[53:56] my father abraham he beat his brushes
[53:59] and plows and his hearts and he went
[54:01] after him why because he knew who he was
[54:05] oh hallelujah who's on the lord's side
[54:08] who's ready to do battle who's ready to
[54:10] take the power that god has placed in
[54:12] you and use that power for others
[54:16] oh yeah
[54:17] i know some of us are shrinking back
[54:20] because we're having a hard time living
[54:21] a victorious
[54:22] life in our own self
[54:24] that's why many of us ain't going after
[54:26] others
[54:29] it's okay
[54:30] don't be condemned
[54:33] those i love
[54:35] i rebuke i chase them
[54:37] i'm letting you know that there's higher
[54:39] heights for you
[54:40] there's deeper depths for you
[54:42] there's a real true overcoming life
[54:45] where the world doesn't have the pull on
[54:46] you like you think it always should
[54:49] just because brother branham said you
[54:50] know
[54:51] a lot you know this sticky nature i
[54:53] think one place maybe it said fish hooks
[54:55] in your elbows or something like that oh
[54:57] we we we want to use
[54:59] so many times it's so convenient for us
[55:01] to use quotes and things in the word to
[55:04] justify our sinful condition
[55:08] let's look at the other side
[55:10] be there for perfect
[55:12] even as your heavenly father is perfect
[55:15] why did he say that
[55:17] because that perfection is in you
[55:19] it just needs the trials it just needs
[55:22] the adversity to produce the character
[55:24] that's hidden in the seed but you would
[55:26] never know that character or that life
[55:29] that was in the seed unless you die out
[55:31] to yourself don't you realize a seed has
[55:33] to rot
[55:34] unless a seed goes into the ground and
[55:36] rot it abideth alone but you got to die
[55:38] out to yourself that the life that is in
[55:41] the seed can spring forth and what does
[55:43] it do when that seed comes to full
[55:45] maturity what does it do it comes back
[55:47] to seed again
[55:49] oh glory to god we're in the seed time
[55:51] we're in the bride time look you're an
[55:53] overcomer i want to tell you if you're
[55:54] falling down just get back up
[55:57] just repent it's for you that's why he
[55:59] died it's for you this message is for
[56:00] you you are an overcomer i don't care if
[56:03] i fall one trillion times i'm gonna get
[56:05] up one trillion and one times why
[56:08] because it's not me that's getting up
[56:10] it's christ in me that's getting up oh
[56:12] if it was left to my own abilities if it
[56:15] was left in my own life i'd have been
[56:16] died and gone a long time ago i would
[56:19] have fallen in the ditch and i would
[56:20] have never got it out oh but god rich in
[56:23] mercy he was looking out for me he saw
[56:26] me they said oh my son come out of there
[56:29] i love you i died for you i paid the
[56:31] price for you you don't have to stay
[56:33] down there anymore you don't have to do
[56:35] pentax you don't have to do woe as me
[56:37] and and beat yourself up i know son
[56:40] that's okay i died for you i paid the
[56:42] price for you it's all settled it's all
[56:44] finished what about the prodigal son he
[56:46] was there in the
[56:48] the pig pen he was wrestling with over a
[56:51] corn husk with another pig and all of a
[56:53] sudden he came to myself he said look
[56:55] the servants in my father's house live
[56:57] better than i do and what did he come
[56:59] back i say just come back
[57:02] oh come with a repent of heart come to
[57:04] the altar repent in your seat right
[57:06] there and you think you're going to have
[57:07] to do all these penta and everything no
[57:09] you'll say oh my son my daughter that
[57:12] was lost come home he'll put a robe
[57:14] he'll slay a fatted calf why because
[57:17] that which was lost has come home i want
[57:19] to tell you there's such love of god in
[57:20] this message there's such a love to be
[57:23] shed abroad towards you why don't you
[57:25] just receive the word why don't you just
[57:27] receive what god has for you why don't
[57:29] you receive what god has spoken of you
[57:31] that you are
[57:32] an overcomer revelations 3 21 would say
[57:35] to him that overcometh will i grant
[57:38] to sit with me and my throne
[57:42] even as i also overcame
[57:44] and has set down with my father
[57:48] in his throne
[57:50] look this isn't guesswork
[57:53] you think god said to him that
[57:55] overcometh will i grant to sit with me
[57:57] and my throne i'm wondering who that's
[57:59] going to be
[58:01] i mean you know i'm going to throw out
[58:02] this test i'm going to have this great
[58:04] adversary and we can just see who makes
[58:06] it through the gauntlet
[58:08] and all of a sudden somebody's gonna pop
[58:10] out on the other side like oh
[58:12] well how many how many how how many are
[58:14] gonna make it
[58:16] no that's not how it works you think
[58:17] he's wondering
[58:18] what you're gonna turn out to be
[58:21] you think he's wondering if you're gonna
[58:22] make it
[58:24] no look the spoken word is the original
[58:26] seed
[58:29] the earth
[58:31] god in the beginning god created the
[58:32] heavens and the earth
[58:34] what was in the earth there was spoken
[58:36] word seeds laying in the earth
[58:39] and all they were waiting for
[58:42] was light
[58:43] but there was darkness and confusion
[58:46] that was covering the earth and it
[58:49] wasn't until god said let there be light
[58:52] and the darkness and confusion rolled
[58:54] away and when that light started to hit
[58:57] that ground and that dirt around that
[58:59] seed something was quickened and that
[59:01] seed came to life now god's not in the
[59:05] end time just wondering
[59:07] when he revealed the seven seals and
[59:09] said it shall be light in the evening
[59:12] time when god said let there be light in
[59:15] ladies come on now there was gross
[59:17] darkness upon the people gross darkness
[59:20] upon the earth there was such darkness
[59:22] and chaos but god said let there be
[59:25] light it shall be light in the evening
[59:28] time let there be light and when the
[59:30] light started to shine and god loosed
[59:32] the seven seals and he revealed the son
[59:34] of man and the mighty god was unveiled
[59:37] before us and the light started to shine
[59:39] down in the age it struck the
[59:41] predestinated seed that he had planted
[59:44] the very spoken word that is the
[59:46] original seed that god spoke to be here
[59:49] in ladies that is sitting right here in
[59:51] this tabernacle in bedford texas that

[1:02:32] somebody so we'll just continue
[1:02:38] lord
[1:02:39] let my son set on one side
[1:02:43] and my other son set on the other
[1:02:46] there's a mother's desire for her son
[1:02:49] but watch
[1:02:50] that place jesus said was predestinated
[1:02:53] this position was not in existence at
[1:02:56] the time
[1:02:57] why
[1:02:58] notice it will be granted to them who it
[1:03:01] was meant for
[1:03:04] what the one
[1:03:06] to set on the right hand and the other
[1:03:08] closest to him
[1:03:11] was yet an overcomer see
[1:03:13] it was still
[1:03:15] it was still and i i don't don't grant i
[1:03:18] can't grant this but it
[1:03:21] was given after the trial comes think of
[1:03:24] this now
[1:03:25] it's given after the trial comes amen
[1:03:27] see
[1:03:28] i can't give this buddy but after the
[1:03:31] trial comes they said on the side uh
[1:03:35] right hand and on the left there's a
[1:03:36] predestinated seed waiting out yonder
[1:03:40] for that
[1:03:41] it will be given to the ones that it's
[1:03:44] promised to it'll be given there but the
[1:03:46] test hasn't come yet there hasn't been
[1:03:50] an overcomer yet you see so here you are
[1:03:53] you're now living in the hour of the
[1:03:56] test and trial because you're the
[1:03:58] overcomer that that seat was reserved
[1:04:01] for and now the trial has come and as
[1:04:04] you're going through the trial look
[1:04:06] don't be discouraged just realize that
[1:04:08] this trial that you're going through is
[1:04:11] because you are an overcomer and there
[1:04:14] is a seat reserved for you in glory and
[1:04:17] just to make sure you don't fall short
[1:04:19] it's not you that's overcoming the trial
[1:04:21] it's christ in you that's overcoming the
[1:04:24] trial so you're guaranteed not to miss
[1:04:26] it oh that just makes me want to shout
[1:04:29] that makes me want to get excited
[1:04:30] because where i've fallen and where i
[1:04:33] fail to make god to meet god at his word
[1:04:35] god has always made up the difference
[1:04:37] for me
[1:04:39] he's always been there with loving arms
[1:04:41] to
[1:04:41] to to take me back
[1:04:44] oh to be an overcomer you have to have
[1:04:46] something to overcome
[1:04:48] that's what the test and trial is for
[1:04:51] i i want to tell you that the prophet of
[1:04:54] god speaks of these things that you are
[1:04:56] predestinated to meet the challenge
[1:05:03] there's a good chance
[1:05:04] oh just for a little drama
[1:05:08] there
[1:05:09] when job would say
[1:05:10] oh the lord speaking where were you when
[1:05:12] the sons of god
[1:05:14] shouted for joy
[1:05:16] oh is it possible there was a group of
[1:05:18] people
[1:05:21] as they saw the plan of god and say you
[1:05:23] know
[1:05:24] there's going to be a time and at the
[1:05:26] very end
[1:05:28] it's going to be the most wicked
[1:05:30] and the most darkest and matter of fact
[1:05:33] my prophet will even make the statement
[1:05:34] i can't even see past 77
[1:05:38] it's going to be such gross darkness
[1:05:40] such evil on the earth but i need
[1:05:42] somebody
[1:05:44] to go down and stand in the evil day
[1:05:47] with a boldness and declare the word of
[1:05:49] god is there somebody that is willing to
[1:05:52] go and manifest my heart's desire and i
[1:05:55] believe there was a group of people
[1:05:57] maybe that were over on the other side
[1:05:59] lord i'll go but do you really know what
[1:06:02] you're signing up for there's something
[1:06:04] called spiritual amnesia i'm gonna let
[1:06:06] you bypass your theophany you're gonna
[1:06:08] go down there when you show up on the
[1:06:10] other side down there you're not even
[1:06:12] gonna know where you came from you're
[1:06:14] not even gonna know where you're going
[1:06:16] but don't worry about it i'm going to
[1:06:18] put something inside of you i'm going to
[1:06:21] put a part of my own self called a
[1:06:24] predestinated seed that no matter what
[1:06:27] happens
[1:06:29] no matter what happens you'll find
[1:06:31] yourself all the way back here standing
[1:06:34] at my side again you won't have to worry
[1:06:37] about a thing in that case lord i'll
[1:06:40] take you out your word go ahead if
[1:06:41] that's your heart's desire lord send me
[1:06:43] on down there until ladies
[1:06:45] i will manifest your word and now that
[1:06:47] the trials and the testings are coming
[1:06:50] you are that overcomer that has a seat
[1:06:53] at the right hand of god
[1:06:55] oh hallelujah
[1:06:57] glory to god
[1:06:59] oh hallelujah you're predestinated to
[1:07:01] meet the challenge of the age
[1:07:08] what is going to stop you from
[1:07:09] manifesting the word
[1:07:11] what's going to stop you is there
[1:07:14] anything going to stop you
[1:07:17] when david was anointed to be king
[1:07:22] what was going to stop david
[1:07:24] from being king over israel
[1:07:28] was it going to be a lion
[1:07:31] was it going to be a bear
[1:07:33] was it going to be a goliath
[1:07:36] what was going to stop david from
[1:07:38] manifesting the spoken word of the
[1:07:40] prophet
[1:07:42] nothing
[1:07:44] now i was just reading the scripture
[1:07:45] today
[1:07:47] and we we referred to it many times
[1:07:49] romans 8 35 and we we've referred to it
[1:07:52] a lot of times to say what shall
[1:07:53] separate
[1:07:55] and you know this is very simple but i
[1:07:57] need simple because i'm a simple thinker
[1:07:59] it says but really when you read it says
[1:08:01] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:08:03] christ now you know i wanted to dive in
[1:08:05] there and maybe see if i could get some
[1:08:07] some some greek out of this word who and
[1:08:10] and maybe i would get some something
[1:08:11] that something more deep about it but
[1:08:12] that word who is used as what so uh the
[1:08:16] the translations uh right it says what
[1:08:18] or who but it just struck me when it
[1:08:20] says who shall separate us from the love
[1:08:23] of christ it struck me that of who is
[1:08:26] somebody
[1:08:28] and i started to think about that no it
[1:08:31] no matter whoever the who is and that
[1:08:33] who includes you
[1:08:36] it might sound simple
[1:08:38] but i started getting excited
[1:08:41] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:08:43] god oh that who is you too you can't
[1:08:46] even do anything to mess this up your
[1:08:48] own self can't mess this up all your
[1:08:50] faults and all your failures and all
[1:08:52] your missteps look you can't miss it
[1:08:54] yourself
[1:08:57] you can't even mess god's program up
[1:09:00] you might have to go through some
[1:09:02] heartache
[1:09:03] you reap what you sow
[1:09:05] you might find yourself on on a hospital
[1:09:07] bed crying out to god and saying god
[1:09:09] lord forgive me
[1:09:11] god might have to take you home early
[1:09:15] god forbid that
[1:09:17] but we have a reassurance as the
[1:09:18] scripture says who shall separate us
[1:09:20] from the love of christ is tribulation
[1:09:23] going to do it
[1:09:25] distress persecution famine
[1:09:27] nakedness peril sword
[1:09:30] he says for i am persuaded that neither
[1:09:31] death nor life nor angels nor
[1:09:34] principalities nor things present nor
[1:09:36] things that come no height no depth nor
[1:09:38] any creature shall be able to separate
[1:09:40] us from the love of god which is in
[1:09:42] jesus christ our lord
[1:09:47] oh glory to god
[1:09:50] no nothing
[1:09:52] no complexes
[1:09:54] no depression
[1:09:56] no drug addiction
[1:09:59] come on now
[1:10:00] some of us are battling some really
[1:10:02] serious things and we're allowing it to
[1:10:04] condemn us in our mind because we think
[1:10:06] i'm a believer i shouldn't have to be
[1:10:09] battling this why am i going through
[1:10:11] depression why am i going through
[1:10:13] condemnation why am i battling this lust
[1:10:15] spirit why is this thing after me and it
[1:10:18] seems i get prayed for it and i have
[1:10:20] victory for three or four or five months
[1:10:22] and all of a sudden i find myself being
[1:10:24] drawn back and it just seems like this
[1:10:26] feeling or this anointing comes over me
[1:10:28] and i can't even control my own actions
[1:10:30] look don't you realize that nothing
[1:10:33] shall separate you from the love of god
[1:10:36] god will constantly woo upon your heart
[1:10:38] and call upon your heart and call you to
[1:10:41] repentance till you come to that place
[1:10:44] of the baptism of the holy ghost and you
[1:10:46] are set free from those things and you
[1:10:48] are delivered look no matter what in all
[1:10:51] these things you are more than
[1:10:53] conquerors through jesus christ
[1:10:56] and i that that's what god might all my
[1:10:58] heart is to have faith in what you are
[1:11:00] you're not the failures
[1:11:03] that's not who you are
[1:11:05] oh i want to just move a little bit
[1:11:06] faster
[1:11:09] first john 5 4 says for what whatsoever
[1:11:12] is born of god overcometh the world and
[1:11:14] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:11:16] world even our faith
[1:11:20] you have been born from god
[1:11:22] you came from god
[1:11:25] you can no more die like david there
[1:11:28] david was anointed and spoken to be the
[1:11:31] the king of israel
[1:11:32] that bear didn't have a chance
[1:11:35] that lion didn't have a chance
[1:11:38] goliath didn't have a chance that
[1:11:40] depression don't have a chance
[1:11:41] hallelujah that prodigal son oh they
[1:11:44] ain't going to stay gone that much
[1:11:45] longer that prodigal daughter ain't
[1:11:47] going to strongly stay gone that much
[1:11:48] longer why because there is a promise to
[1:11:51] the bride of jesus christ that has faith
[1:11:53] in who she is that will manifest the
[1:11:55] word that was spoken of her
[1:11:58] nothing can stop that
[1:12:00] now the prophet of god would go on to
[1:12:01] say this
[1:12:04] jesus had perfect faith
[1:12:08] he had it and it come because he was the
[1:12:10] word
[1:12:12] and you become the word
[1:12:14] you become the word
[1:12:16] as you receive the word
[1:12:20] i think we ought to read that again
[1:12:25] and you become the word
[1:12:28] you become the word as you receive the
[1:12:30] word if ye abide in me and my words in
[1:12:33] you my words which this word
[1:12:36] abides in you
[1:12:38] then ask what you will and it'll be done
[1:12:41] for you see if you say to this mountain
[1:12:44] be moved and don't doubt but believe
[1:12:46] what you've said then you shall have
[1:12:48] what you said don't doubt the identity
[1:12:52] crisis look i want to tell you don't
[1:12:54] doubt it that identity crisis should be
[1:12:56] over the confusion should be over the
[1:12:58] struggle should be over you keep
[1:13:00] struggling and wondering if you are the
[1:13:02] bride you keep struggling and wondering
[1:13:04] if the message is for you look you need
[1:13:06] to get past all of those things get past
[1:13:09] the struggle let's go into battle now
[1:13:11] let's be filled with the baptism of the
[1:13:13] holy ghost and i'll draw our swords and
[1:13:16] go to battle

[1:13:44] secret things in the world why don't you
[1:13:46] reconsecrate your life and say lord this
[1:13:48] used to be a place that i i may be snuck
[1:13:51] off and i did this or that but now i'm
[1:13:53] coming to to claim this space for you

[1:14:14] that i can be a vessel that's so cleaned
[1:14:16] out and so filled with the holy ghost
[1:14:18] and fire that i'll be like apostolic
[1:14:21] times i'll start busting out of the
[1:14:22] upper room speaking in tongues laying
[1:14:25] hands on the sick and then recovering
[1:14:27] doing the greater works speaking the
[1:14:29] word and seeing these signs following
[1:14:31] believers
[1:14:33] oh that ain't too much to ask that's
[1:14:35] thus saith the lord
[1:14:37] i say oh god let it
[1:14:40] be this is a lengthy quote but it's
[1:14:43] worth reading
[1:14:46] this is brother branham preaches how can
[1:14:48] i overcome in the morning service to
[1:14:50] perfect faith he says see as i said in
[1:14:53] the beginning you are born defeated
[1:14:56] and that birth can never bring you to
[1:14:58] life because you're born defeated
[1:15:02] well maybe you just got some answers
[1:15:04] that's why you're always struggling
[1:15:08] you're born that way that's what you
[1:15:11] signed up for
[1:15:12] you signed up for spiritual amnesia to
[1:15:14] show up defeated
[1:15:16] but that was god's perfect plan
[1:15:19] he wanted you to be here
[1:15:21] allowed you to show up defeated
[1:15:26] and you're in a defeated world amongst
[1:15:29] defeated people
[1:15:30] amongst defeated creeds defeated
[1:15:32] denominations
[1:15:34] you've got to come to victory some way
[1:15:38] oh
[1:15:39] i love this message
[1:15:43] i love it so much the prophet's not
[1:15:45] about to go to some
[1:15:46] mystic
[1:15:48] far out
[1:15:49] algebraic equation
[1:15:51] and trying to tie all of this with that
[1:15:53] and make some big pompous show and say
[1:15:56] oh if you could do all this
[1:15:58] well i love it so much she says
[1:16:01] you got to come to victory somewhere
[1:16:04] it's just like a lily
[1:16:08] oh thank you lord
[1:16:10] where is a lily
[1:16:12] i think it's one of the prettiest
[1:16:13] flowers that there is
[1:16:15] i'm very fond of those great cali lilies
[1:16:17] and pond lilies i think there's nothing
[1:16:19] hardly as pretty
[1:16:21] as a great big pawn lily
[1:16:24] call it a water lily how's
[1:16:26] it's
[1:16:27] radiance now where does it come from
[1:16:31] now
[1:16:32] if you realize what happens right here i
[1:16:34] just maybe i'll just throw that out
[1:16:35] there for somebody that doesn't know but
[1:16:37] the prophet's talking about you
[1:16:41] so so as we continue
[1:16:43] realize the prophet is talking about
[1:16:46] you he says now where does it come from
[1:16:50] it's a little seed
[1:16:52] down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond
[1:16:56] and that little seed yet all the
[1:16:59] radiance
[1:17:00] that'll ever shine in it
[1:17:02] is in it right then
[1:17:04] when it's in that mud
[1:17:06] but it has to strive
[1:17:08] daily
[1:17:10] knowing that there is something
[1:17:13] it's black
[1:17:14] it's dirty it's mucky it's slimy
[1:17:17] and that slime that it's living in
[1:17:20] yet it presses its way through the mud
[1:17:24] the muck and the waters and the stagnant
[1:17:27] places until it sticks its head above in
[1:17:30] the light and expresses
[1:17:32] what's been hid in it all the time
[1:17:37] i think that's an overcomer
[1:17:42] that once in sin once did the things
[1:17:45] that was wrong
[1:17:47] don't worry about it now now god's
[1:17:48] talking to somebody
[1:17:51] listen to the prophet
[1:17:54] he said don't worry about it now once
[1:17:56] did things that was wrong
[1:17:58] then now why look back into the pond
[1:18:01] again
[1:18:02] see
[1:18:03] look you have god by his predestination
[1:18:07] has brought this seed to life and it's
[1:18:09] pressing itself see coming to light and
[1:18:12] now on top of all that it has overcome
[1:18:15] see it doesn't express itself down there
[1:18:20] it's getting up to express itself
[1:18:23] neither did you in your sin in adultery
[1:18:26] and everything you lived in you didn't
[1:18:29] express nothing
[1:18:31] oh
[1:18:33] hallelujah thank you oh thank you lord
[1:18:36] jesus you didn't express
[1:18:38] nothing when you were out there in sin
[1:18:40] but there was a seed in there and it got
[1:18:43] a chance to press itself into light and
[1:18:46] now you're in the presence of jesus
[1:18:48] christ with the sunlight it brought out
[1:18:50] what you really was in the beginning you
[1:18:52] see what i mean you saw the light you
[1:18:55] bloomed out you laid your heart open and
[1:18:57] now you're a lily look god has brought
[1:19:00] you out of the muck admirer he's brought
[1:19:03] you out of those things giving you
[1:19:05] victory look don't worry about what you
[1:19:07] did in the past don't look back to the
[1:19:09] pond again paul said in ephesians 4 22
[1:19:12] he said that you put off concerning the
[1:19:14] formal conversation of the old man which
[1:19:16] is corrupt according to deceitful lust
[1:19:18] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:19:20] mind
[1:19:22] i'll just invite the musicians to come
[1:19:25] that might perk some people's interest
[1:19:31] he says in that ye put on the new man
[1:19:34] which after god is created in
[1:19:36] righteousness and true holiness
[1:19:40] as i've made a habit of i'm not done
[1:19:42] preaching yet but
[1:19:44] now listen to what the prophet says and
[1:19:46] he that is in you
[1:19:48] so we just read that look it's that
[1:19:50] predestinated seed coming to life you
[1:19:52] didn't express anything when you were
[1:19:54] out there in sin you didn't express
[1:19:56] anything when you're out there in the
[1:19:57] muck and mire he says greater is he that
[1:19:59] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:20:01] what is in you that's
[1:20:02] greater what is in you that is greater
[1:20:06] now we're believers right
[1:20:08] we have we we want to have faith in what
[1:20:10] god has made you
[1:20:13] greater is he that so so what is in you
[1:20:15] that's greater it's
[1:20:16] christ the anointed
[1:20:19] god that was in christ in you
[1:20:23] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:20:25] that is in the world then if he is in
[1:20:27] you
[1:20:28] it's not you any more living
[1:20:31] it's him living in you see it's not your
[1:20:33] thinking what you would think about this
[1:20:35] it's what he said about it
[1:20:39] then if he is in you he absolutely would
[1:20:42] not deny what he said
[1:20:46] when brother branham preaches how can i
[1:20:48] overcome
[1:20:49] i i thought it's so profound so what
[1:20:52] what we're illuminating here is that god
[1:20:54] has done something in your life
[1:20:56] it's christ the anointed that is in you
[1:20:59] he is the one that is willing he is the
[1:21:01] one that has caused you to believe he is
[1:21:03] the one that has given you victory he is
[1:21:05] the one that's picked you back up he's
[1:21:06] the one that's wrought that marvelous
[1:21:08] victory in your life he's the one that
[1:21:09] delivered you at camp he's the one that
[1:21:11] spoke to your heart at church it's
[1:21:13] christ that is in you that predestinated
[1:21:15] seed when the word strikes that seed it
[1:21:17] brings it forth to life there's a life
[1:21:19] of christ now blooming forth in you it's
[1:21:21] christ in you the hope of glory greater
[1:21:24] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:21:26] the world and when brother branham
[1:21:27] starts to preach how can i overcome it
[1:21:30] it's a striking statement he goes i want
[1:21:32] to preach on how can i overcome uh this
[1:21:35] is my subject and the reason i want to
[1:21:37] preach that because we're living in an
[1:21:38] age where i think we should never let
[1:21:41] the spirit of revival die
[1:21:45] i thought my that's that's a striking
[1:21:47] statement that it seems maybe not even
[1:21:49] tied to his what his text and what he's
[1:21:52] going to say but he said this is my
[1:21:54] subject how can i overcome because i
[1:21:57] think it's an age that we should never
[1:21:59] let the spirit of revival die don't you
[1:22:02] realize that's why the devil's after you
[1:22:04] young people you had a revival a spirit
[1:22:07] of revival break out in your life at
[1:22:09] camp and the devil has been after you
[1:22:11] every time since trying to quench that
[1:22:14] spirit of revival that's in you why
[1:22:16] because the spirit of revival is the
[1:22:18] spirit of christ that's living inside of
[1:22:21] you and the devil is doing everything he
[1:22:23] can to quench the fire of god in you
[1:22:25] because we're living in an hour that we
[1:22:28] should never let the spirit of revival
[1:22:30] die
[1:22:32] oh i say oh god if god sent a vindicated
[1:22:35] prophet that said we're living an hour
[1:22:37] that we should never let the spirit of
[1:22:39] revival die then i say oh god let me do
[1:22:42] everything in my power to stay
[1:22:45] constantly revive and no no no i'm not
[1:22:48] talking about so just
[1:22:50] okay when camp's over where's the
[1:22:51] revival
[1:22:54] brother random tells the story about
[1:22:56] those clergymen they wanted to go see
[1:22:58] the west revival
[1:23:00] oh i'm gonna fly out and see what this
[1:23:03] big thing was and what cost where is
[1:23:05] this welsh river where is the bride's
[1:23:08] revival
[1:23:10] where is this louisiana camp revival
[1:23:13] where is this young people's camp i want
[1:23:15] to go see what it's about well go ahead
[1:23:17] and drive down to dry creek louisiana
[1:23:19] ain't nothing there
[1:23:21] the lights are shut off there ain't no
[1:23:23] lights on in the building if you go
[1:23:25] looking for the revival the revival
[1:23:28] wasn't in the building the revival
[1:23:29] wasn't a people and some of those people
[1:23:32] have come back to bedford texas and
[1:23:34] they're gathered together in the house
[1:23:35] of god that's where the spirit of
[1:23:37] revival is just like that man that cop
[1:23:39] was there he was twirling that really
[1:23:41] baton and they come up said oh sir i
[1:23:43] want to ask you a question where is the
[1:23:45] welsh revival he said you're looking at
[1:23:48] it you want to know where the pride
[1:23:49] revival is i'm looking at the prize
[1:23:51] revival the bride's revival has gathered
[1:23:54] together around the revealed word of the
[1:23:55] hour never let the spirit of revival die
[1:23:58] why because it's christ the anointed
[1:24:00] word of the hour taken on flesh in you
[1:24:03] oh let's all stand
[1:24:07] oh hallelujah
[1:24:11] oh my
[1:24:13] well
[1:24:14] please start playing something
[1:24:18] oh glory to god
[1:24:26] you know many times you might go
[1:24:27] experience a ball game or
[1:24:31] you go experience something as a
[1:24:32] spectator
[1:24:35] i don't want to be a spectator
[1:24:38] i want to be a participator
[1:24:42] it's it's fun watching sports
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:47] it's it's fun
[1:24:48] going and being a spectator at times but
[1:24:51] i don't want to be a spectator
[1:24:55] i can't
[1:24:56] i ain't a streamer
[1:25:00] no way
[1:25:01] look i remember when i
[1:25:03] uh went to brother ron peterson's church
[1:25:07] and that they were facing the same exact
[1:25:09] problems we had
[1:25:11] what no way in the world i was gonna be
[1:25:13] in the back
[1:25:14] no way if it meant getting up three and
[1:25:17] i drove an hour and a half i know what
[1:25:18] i'm talking about
[1:25:20] i knew if i didn't get to church 45
[1:25:22] minutes early i was gonna be sitting in
[1:25:23] the back well i wouldn't be sitting in
[1:25:25] the back i'd be sitting in the back of
[1:25:26] the church and i didn't want to sit in
[1:25:27] the back of the church i wanted to sit
[1:25:29] in the front of the church so i knew if
[1:25:30] i wanted to sit in the front of the
[1:25:30] church i better get there 45 minutes
[1:25:32] early and if i got there 30 minutes
[1:25:33] early and i was a little wait late
[1:25:35] because
[1:25:36] early is on time and on time is late and
[1:25:38] late is unacceptable where are these
[1:25:40] things coming from but that's all right
[1:25:42] that's how i was
[1:25:44] i just wasn't going to let it happen i
[1:25:45] just i just wanted to be there i wanted
[1:25:48] to be there on time so i realized look i
[1:25:50] had to leave early to get there on time
[1:25:53] there was something in me i just wanted
[1:25:54] to be in the house of god i wanted to be
[1:25:58] in his presence i wanted to be i wanted
[1:26:00] to be a participator i don't want to be
[1:26:03] a spectator i don't want to be all at
[1:26:05] home watching on the screen but praise
[1:26:07] god we have that ability if you can't be
[1:26:09] here then at least it's something but oh
[1:26:11] god i want a true experience i don't
[1:26:14] want to be a spectator watching god move
[1:26:16] in your life and god move in your life
[1:26:18] oh i'm thankful for it i'm glad that
[1:26:20] god's moving into your lives but i see
