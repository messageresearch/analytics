members of the bride of christ lord you've called us out of the world and you've set us aside for a reason for a purpose lord your word says that many are called but few are chosen and lord we claim

things you've done through the ages lord the provisions you've made for your children all along the way or we can look back and say if i have a seat across a river seems to be uncrossable i can call

intents of the heart lord lord they don't have to be spoken they don't have to be uttered but lord your presence here this morning can provide for whatever we have need of so lord we know the benefits of coming together lord how it strengthens us in our faith and our bodies even lord as we sing these songs and courses lord we can let the thoughts and the cares of the world fall aside but lord we

presence lord you can fill us all and we just prepare for the the coming word lord that you're going to quicken to us we pray lord lord just we want to enter in to fellowship with you this morning we claim it now and believe it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen amen good to be gathered in the presence of the lord amen certainly you want to welcome everyone in the house of god this morning and then all our visitors will welcome you amen it's good to have with us uh judith's uncle brother joshua mccabe and his wife sister yvonne will welcome you this morning amen as we invite brother mike for us i'm ready and god bless you good morning you know when we uh often when we read the psalms there's sometimes uh we miss it there's a little introductory statement some few little words perhaps in italics that are underneath the psalm underneath the chapter and you know sometimes it's those little words that change completely how we might look at the psalm you know psalm 49 is one of those chapters and it certainly catches my attention when those little words describe this as a psalm for the sons of korah this is a psalm written especially for them you know we're no doubt familiar with the sorry tale of korra you know he was a levite a minister who gathered together a group of people against the word of god for his hour you know it's a minister who believed he had a new revelation you know what maybe he had a clear teaching you know and he influenced many others you know declaring a position against the move of god in that day of course this led to a showdown in numbers 16 and uh you know the lord demonstrated where he stood the earth opened up and swallowed korra there was a fire that went out from the lord the next day there was a plague that killed thousands even their little children it says in numbers 16 27. it's certainly a very sobering story in a kind of a reminder of the importance of not getting too caught up in our own little revelation making sure that it lines up with the word for the hour but i think it was brother john andes was here a couple weeks ago and he he mentioned uh an interesting scripture and it was in numbers 26 11 which says this notwithstanding the children of korah died not so while all the other children of all the other families perished gruesomely really over the course of two days for some reason the children of korah the one who had led this rebellion were specifically spared by the lord when all around them perished these who would seem most worthy of death were preserved by the lord you know many generations later these children they show up again the sons of korah show up in scripture again the scripture also calls them core heights as it says in exodus 6 24. but you know it's in first chronicles 6 when david is laying out the order of worship and the ministry of the temple and you know the things pertaining to the restoration of the work they show up again in this in this story we're all familiar with asaph we've heard the name you know one of the levites was appointed as a musician who led in the worship at the temple but you know there was another and it says in 1st chronicles 6 31 and these are they whom david set over the service of song in the house of the lord after that the ark had rest and they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing until solomon had built the house of the lord in jerusalem and then they waited on their office according to their order and these are they that waited with their children of the sons of the kohathites heman a singer it goes on in verse 37 to identify that he was the son of korah went through his entire genealogy and he turns out to be one of the sons of korah so here we have the sons of korah and all his children it identifies 17 of them that are now identified as worshipers in the house of the lord in first chronicles 25 goes a little bit further in verse 1. it says moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph and heman and of judgethen who should prophesy with harps with salt trees and with symbols so not only were they worshipers in the house of the lord but now they were speaking forth the word of god with their lips these are those sons of core in fact in verse 5 it goes so far as to say that heman was the king's seer in the words of god to lift up the horn a prophet of the lord you know those who you would think would be worthy of death and a partaker of the judgment of their father had been lifted up to become a worshiper in the house of the lord and to take the word of god on their lips and speak it forth here's another second chronicles 5 12. also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph and heman the sons of korah and jejuthin with their sons and brethren being arrayed in white linen and finally there's a story in second chronicles 20 of an hour when a great enemy came up against the children of israel and it seemed like they could not overcome and king jehoshaphat and the people they fell on their face before the lord calling out to him for deliverance and it says in verse 17 that the word of the lord came and said this ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord and it's in verse 19 that the core heights the sons of korah began to raise their voice in worship and praise what it says the beauty of holiness it says in verse 21 and in verse 22 when they the sons of korah began to sing in praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten because of their worship because of the sons of korah the enemy was defeated the children of korah and psalm 49 is their song it says in verse 5 of psalm 49 this is what the songs this is a song for the sons of korah to sing wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels the iniquity of my past shall compass me about they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give god a ransom for him these were people who knew a little bit about redemption when they could have been consumed when they deserved to be consumed and perished and judged because of the sins of their father by the mercy of the lord god plucked them out and raised them up clothed them in white linen set them in a place that they could be worshippers in the house of the lord even so much as to take the word of god and put it on their lips and by their worship defeat the enemy this is somebody who knows something about redemption this is their redemption song there was none that could sing this song this was a song specifically for the sons of korah [Music] is psalm 49 goes on to describe the foolishness of mankind around them but as they sing in verse 17 it says this when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him but now this is the testimony of the sons of korah in verse 15 but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave he shall receive me selah i'm just curious are there any sons of korah in the house tonight somebody who might have been worthy of death worthy to be consumed because of the sins of their father but yet god plucked you out in his mercy he puts you in a place as a worshiper in his house he clothed you with white linen he put the word of god in your lips that you might speak it and by taking that word be able to defeat the enemy any sons of korah in the house this morning this is the psalm of the sons of korah so if we read that this morning you know i hope that you can put yourself in the scripture let's just go ahead and read that starting in verse 1. hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world both low and high rich and poor together my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding i will incline mine near to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth forever then he should still live forever and not see corruption for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others their inward thought is that their houses shall continue forever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names nevertheless man being in honor abideth not he is like the beasts that perish this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings selah like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave he shall receive me selah for not thou prayed when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light man that is in honor and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish amen amen god bless you may have your seeds oh this says are they oh this is the they that the lord has made that the lord has made oh

told my mom i said well uh you know she usually sings a song you know during the time that i know she's going through that phase as well and she would say must jesus be at a cross alone and hold the world go free and so you know i think about that every single day and say well what is my trier uh even if i'm thinking i i think i'm good right now i'm expecting it i'm thinking oh okay so how am i gonna do i can't do it by myself but i hope he's going to help me but i look around me i know a lot of people going through you know the the bride of christ is not without trier and so uh but one

mortal body and you gave it to us oh lord father may we just see what a beautiful thing that is this morning we just ask you father that each need that's here this morning every struggle every hungry heart [Music] the questions and the burdens you said father if we'd cast them upon you that your burden was easy [Music] and that you administered to us we invite you to do that this morning be with us today father and each one we ask these wonderful things in jesus precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning certainly uh yeah we're done uh certainly wonderful to be back in the house of the lord and i spent a few days with my mother and she's really doing well she went fishing with me and so we sat out on the pier she spent eight hours out there you know she even got the pole and put it over the side so we're really grateful for that and just trusting that the lord will bless you we just wanted uh before we start this morning that you know the services were so good as i watched the brothers preach and break the word of god i thought they raised such a high standard i was afraid that i wouldn't be able to meet it i i was going to stay a few more weeks but we'll be in missouri next weekend and we're happy to be here with you today and we trust the lord we want to take this moment right now we're going to brother cosman and brother matthew are going to be heading to romania for a couple weeks to minister there and and you know we don't always see people's gifts in our place and you know the scripture even says that many times in your own country you're not recognized you know but you know when cosmon goes there he'll be ministering over there and preaching and you might not know him here as a minister as a preacher he's done so many other things for us but on that field that's where his calling is and you know so he's just not going as an interpreter he's actually going to hold services himself and preach and minister the word of god so we're we're grateful for both of them and the lord sends them out in twos and so they're going out from us amen the the tithing and offering that you give will go to help support their trip and so we're going to ask them if they would come up if kosman and matthew had come up if they're here and we just want to ask we just want to all of us to pray together with them and ask them thing that the holy spirit will give them one mind and and the unity together and that uh that the love of christ will be reflected in their humility and and through that that they might know it's not that they're bringing things that they've maybe the people don't know but just every little bit adds on and builds so we just wanted to take this time just to lay our hands on them and ask them that the holy spirit would be with them our gracious heavenly father as part of our body father they represent us father and we have identified ourself with your gospel with your name with the message that you've sent and father we ask that your spirit father just so quicken them heavenly father that the light of the gospel would shine through them and father that they'd recognize that there's something different a love that is shed abroad from their heart father a humility that the people can see it's not about them and they're not trying to make a name they're just trying to bring the life and the promises and the power to the people father may their minds be clear may their hearts be open to your leadership father may they be in such harmony that as they go together that your spirit would be so manifested father may they see the fruits of their labor may the those that they come in contact know that they've meant you in the flesh we ask you to go with them now in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you brothers we trust the lord my belief delete i got a little testimony before i know i'm kind of you know before i get in the word but you know the other day i came out of my room and i hadn't cut my hair for about three weeks you know i was feeling pretty good pretty scruff but i had to go to a barber and i never pray about going to a barber you know but all of a sudden i just felt you know i knew the lord i just had this burden on my heart to pray for a barber and i had a place i always went i wasn't real happy there they cut hair real good but you know they're kind of you know biker type guys you know and and so i just didn't feel like going there and i thought of the different shops that i'd been to and and so i i thought you know i'll um i'll sit down and i i look what it where what are the shops in the area and my heart fell upon this one barber and shop and i don't know why i wasn't even the kind of name that i would be attracted to so i tried to call him up and i didn't get that shop i got another shop and i and i said no that's that didn't fit right so i finally got a hold of it and i asked the person i said are you open yes and do you have time to cut my hair yes i came in there and i was the only one in the barber shop which i really like i don't like it when there's a bunch of people there and then that guy's clipping your hair so fast you know and so i sat down and i listened and they had christian music playing uh and uh and a nice lady and and uh uh you know had her little dog there and and uh so we got to talking you know and about uh she was talking about her business and how how hard it was but yet she felt the lord had given it to her and i was encouraging her along and everything and i it you know it i knew i was drawn there you understand that i mean i don't see i sat down and i prayed lord show me where you want me to have my hair cut i don't have that much hair that you really need to get a word of the lord to have it cut you know but i i just felt to go so we got to talking and and somehow the conversation she came that found out i was a pastor you know and oh praise god i'm cutting the hair of a pastor you know and uh and i said no don't worry we're all sinners saved by grace so as we talked along a little bit i said to her i said you know i'd like to bring you a book to to read i i it encouraged you in a faith and i thought i'd give her man sent from god you know and really encourage her and then she said you know there was a young black man that came in here and to have his hair cut and he gave me two books and and i said oh she said and she ran over and grabbed them and it was the token and uh and well i i just i trying to think of what the other it it was i think it was maybe uh uh the token and uh the voice of the sign or uh then i thought there she had two brother branham books right there that someone i don't even know if the brother goes to our church or not but uh i just thought you know what there's something there and i i just really felt that maybe that god's going to do something i don't know what'll come out of it but uh i just thought that that was pretty special to me to know that that we have a god that's worked and and so whoever that young man was if he if he comes to our fellowship he says he sings and and so but anyway i just think that it just lets you know god's god will do whatever he has to do amen he's that kind of god so well let's fellowship around god's word this morning i i don't know exactly how to approach the things that are in my heart i went out to san diego and i took a couple books with me i took the book that we're studying out of it is is the rising of the sun i took leadership and i took proving his word and when i got back into this message here is at the rising of the sun in the two weeks that i was gone i only covered five pages and it's so rich and so beautiful that we'll just try to go through it so i think i'm going to approach a little different this morning we're just going to go through it and minister out of it and then we'll listen to it at the end 14 minutes so let's stand together this morning and let's turn in our bibles to the gospel or the prophecy if you would like to speak of it that way of malachi and and we'll read in the fourth chapter of malachi starting with the fourth verse and it says remember ye malachi 4 4 remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments he says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse our heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated as we've been uh walking through this uh wonderful uh sermon that we've been playing and studying we've been talking about the scripture that our messenger used that if the same spirit that was in christ jesus dwell in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies and the prophet of god is in this great message is obviously we understand that men have had so many different ideas and so many different viewpoints they've been taught so many things and had so many things explained to them that there's a desire and a call in man's heart for the truth uh we know that there's that we have just been in our country through uh uh what they refer to as a pandemic or a plague and uh you know somebody developed a bug and the bug got out into society and it just lets you know you know the prophet of god said he said they were there looking in those test tubes and and he the called out to him they just looked up and kept going on and you know we've always wondered what was all that i've seen that applied to so many things but yet we have something that just actually affected and changed the world it affected us there's been people that we haven't seen at church for over a year year and a half some people have gone and some have fallen away and and it's caused very a lot of different choices and we know that through it all there's been all kinds of information and all kinds of things told uh some people are afraid of of the vaccine and and i i don't blame them for that you know others ask me should i uh should i get the vaccine well i believe it's a personal choice uh i did but uh i don't know if that i got i had the sickness and i've got through it i'm supposed to have natural immunity and and after yet i take the shot and i wear a mask and they put you on the plane with 350 people that you don't know whether they're sick or not and and they all take their mask off to eat and this this bug knows when you're standing and it knows when you're sitting you know it knows if you've been good or bad you know so uh it you know it the it's it's it's uh it's a mass confusion and satan is the author of confusion and you you've got to understand that part of all this is exactly what's all in the plan of god because when something like this all comes up i i remember when the first heart transplant came i mean everybody was you know wondering well are your souls in your heart and are you going to get somebody else's soul like you know like people were worried like they were the next transplant patient but you know things like this cause things and it affects your mind and we're gonna we're gonna work towards something here this morning so it affects your mind and people don't know how to think that and they don't know so satan's offered this confusion and and and the confusion is an atmosphere it's an atmosphere in a confused atmosphere a panic and these different things that are created you find yourself in something and you don't know how to to respond you don't know how to react you don't know what's the politically correct thing to say or do or how to respond and that's that is by design and because that's what the enemy is trying to do he's trying to prepare the people for his complete uh takeover you know where the at where the antichrist will come and and it won't necessarily be as we might think and one certain person but we know that the mark of the beast is on your forehead and we understand that's to take the thinking and the mark on your hand is to do the work and he wants to place this mark on us but god has a mark amen and he has something that he's desiring to mark us with and so we under we we saw that this great thing that our we begin to talk about that that god wanted to impart to his children his spirit and we talked about this spirit he and our messenger is trying to bring us to the understanding that there's something special about this power that's given to the church in this day that there is a quickening power there is a the spirit of god that has been set aside for this day to be given to his elect children that is going to manifest something and in our heart there's been a struggle for that and that we've always desired to have the spirit of god and and so we began to look and he began to tell us about trying to express to us what this great quickening power is and and it was beautiful because he took us through how that what the seed is planted and the sun has got the shine on it to bring it to life as we listen to that we begin to understand that the struggle is not ours it's not our struggle jesus said look at the little lily look at it neither toils nor it spins but yet look how it's adorned with glory solomon all his glory isn't in that ordained just is one of these lilies another cause the lily didn't make itself into a lily it was god that made it into a lily and i believe he's trying to bring us to a place where we come to a peace and we understand that the struggle is not ours the battle is not ours it's his work we're his workmanship in christ jesus foreordained unto good works that we should walk in them and so it's not we don't have to find the work we don't have to go make the work he he told us he said that a sheep it doesn't produce wool it doesn't go out there and say i'm going to eat this and i'm going to do this and i'm going to go here and drink this and do all these mechanical things that's going to produce wool no he says he bears wool he bears wool because he bears it from his nature because that's the way that he was made and and we were made the sons and daughters of god so much so that he had our names in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and now this great message is coming to us it's beginning to speak to us and so we understood that man has always tried to accomplish things through his works through his mechanics and and but he's now he's trying to tell something but god's got something else for the believer and something else for the church that that that comes from him and quickens and anoints them and brings to life what that god had planted in you so and we call this the quickening power quickening means to be made alive and you can do everything that you want to do you can light candles you can read prayer books you can you can do all the rituals that you want and that will never bring that to life there's only one thing that brings it to life and that's the word of god faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so the gospel is what god chose god chose the foolishness of preaching he told by the gospel he who hath an ear to hear let him hear look that's the way that god chose it he chose to come preaching and that's what jesus did he came preaching and went into the synagogues and he went and he began to spread the good news talking about a father and above and a kingdom that was to come okay and that uh in our that our hearts and our lives but not to be deceived by this present world in fact the scripture says the present evil world not to be deceived by this world connect not to come to a place where you're entrapped by the things that they teach and the things that they say so much so that the word of god tells us that education in science and civilization is of the devil it never was in the beginning of god's plan but it's something that that man has began to strive after because he he took from the the fruit of the tree of knowledge and and wisdom and knowledge puffeth up and and knowledge is forever learning and there's no peace in it there's no rest in it but yet here's a gospel that's going out for them that have an ear for those that can hear that there's something that god is going to provide his children and it's himself it's his spirit amen he said john surely came them baptized with water under the repentance of sin but i've come to be baptized you at the holy ghost so that's what we're talking about we're talking about a power that comes from god and it can make alive in you amen something that nothing else can make alive but him because spirit that could make you alive that's what every time we say quicken if you put in your heart make alive bring to life and so he'd be talking to talk about man because that and he and preaching a man there's a spirit that can come from god can make you alive cannot just in this world but in the world to come it it's a it's a a gift of god eternal life and it'll make you alive and not only will it make your spirit alive but it will also quicken this mortal body make this mortal body alive and so man has tried to do it and this is how we've went so far that man has tried to obtain this spiritual cry of his heart because there's a deep that calls to a deed there's something that's built in you by by the divine province of god is something that wants to come alive it wants to come out if there's there's something in you that you've got a consciousness of god that's why the curse in this generation says they no longer want to keep god in their conscience they don't only want to be mindful of god and their conscience is seared with a hot iron that they no longer retain god in their knowledge but it's not so for you most of you can go back no matter how you raised when you were a little kid they're just you had this sense of a god you had their this sense that they're the only way i can express it is here you have a family you have everything but yet there's another part of you that you didn't feel you belonged that this really isn't like you're an alien i can hardly explain it and at the end you went through life and then you you heard about the things of god and you were attracted to him and so we we understood as our messages trying to express to us you you you can't obtain what's given to you by work now you have to have mechanics you have to be in order you have to do but you need something that makes it move and so we're trying to separate the spirit of god and the quickening power of god from anything that man does it's a gift it's not an earned gift it's a gift and so we we got sorted through the message and if and we're going to just we started picking up here uh it we went as far as the the paragraphs of 225. and and so we'll just kind of just walk through this real quick together this morning it says the quickening power wasn't only in their soul but it was all over them not only the dynamics come in to quicken but it quickened the mechanics too you see what i mean they were so quickened until their tongue spoke in another language they were so quickened by the power of the resurrection of christ until they laid their hands they were so quickened with quickening power till they laid their hands on the sick and they got well it quickened your mortal body they were healed by laying on of their hands so he's telling us that it just wasn't a mental or a spiritual experience that the quickening power not only transformed your heart and your mind but it transformed your actions in other words you would you would recommend billy would call me and say brother david i'm i'm sick i say well billy i know a good doctor and that would be good and then maybe he said i went to that doctor but he wasn't able to help me i said well okay then i i know another doctor you know i've been quickened so now it's just not gonna be in word it's just not gonna be in in a philosophy but now it's actually quickened to where now it actually produces a mortal body work of laying on a hand or a praise and worship or or of giving show me your faith without your works and i'll show you my faith by my word so because it transformed just not from quickening their soul to where i say oh i feel good in my spirit i feel like i'm it's in my soul but it actually took my body and had my body produced spiritual works or a pattern of good works because it's just not left there so not only does it quicken your spirit oh i feel at peace i feel saved it's like the little boy that went to the just visit his brothers at the lumber camp and he said he said oh son you don't want to go up there when they find out you're a christian they'll really make a lot of fun of you oh oh i'm not worried mama so he goes up there and he comes back and his mother said how did it go up up there with uh all them lumberjacks and all them guys carrying on the way they carry on he said how did it go for you being a christian oh it went good mama they never found out that's having it on your mind and in your spirit but when it's quickened it doesn't just quicken this it actually quickens your outside experience and you know when i was a very young christian i remember i went to a coke machine at the job and i put in a quarter and that thing started spitting out quarters you know some guy said oh that's a slot machine you know and banged it and see if you get some more quarters out of there well i had this big handful of quarters in my hand well i brought it back into the office those guys are saying what what are you doing man we could all have cokes you know they all thought i was crazy i it wasn't even a a second thought to me you know like i was a new christian living those things and being free from all those things was just so much on my heart i didn't want to be touched by the world or the stains of the world the trouble is christianity's got too common to us and we let all those little things go by i'd never used to walk by a piece of paper on the ground that i wouldn't pick it up it was a consciousness like if it doesn't only quicken your your your heart in your but it quickens your mortal body it pushes it to a place that it actually uh goes in and and produces actions in your body that wouldn't normally be there you know okay i've seen it a lot of times even christians maybe you'll be walking somewhere and somebody'll bump into it and you'll throw your shoulder out a little bit you know like you're some sort of king kong see these are the things as long as we keep it in the spirit realm and as long as we keep it in the mental realm can never manifest him because the promise is is to deny that jesus christ has come in the flesh in other words you're denying that the quickening power has come in your flesh and jesus christ is manifesting himself in you through you by his word oh otherwise it's theology how many wants to go beyond theology we had an example in our day of a man that lived what he believed that's right okay so let's look as we're running through this this morning now notice paragraph 230. well we'll just kind of read down and see if we can start to if it comes to 29 if it comes into you now you can say it so but if it be so these signs follow that you see it quickens your mortal body it'll quicken you you see what i we we just talked about there that's where he says it so that comes in these signs will be in your body they'll be in your life okay okay but you can say it is but if it's so it also quickens this body into total obedience to god's word now notice notice the quickening in the presence of god why why is this spirit wanna quicken you into the presence of god why it was the spirit of god that raised up jesus from the grave and the spirit of god i give unto them eternal life come from the greek word if you look it up zoe which moves it through you and then quickens even their mind now we want the the spirit of god is not it's going he's saying so don't don't miss the fact that it's also gonna produce uh if your flesh is gonna it's gonna manifest in your flesh also but he says it quickens your mind now the scripture says let this mind be in you that was in christ jesus so it's it's going to change or bring alive in you a completely different way of thinking something is actually going to happen in other words what comes through your five senses now you are totally perceiving that because you have a new mind it brought another mind to you another way of thinking that's why the battleground is where in the mind because satan is trying to get a hold of that mind because if he quickens in other words you are what you eat you manifest what you think so god's trying to come down and he's trying to say that i'm going to quicken your mind when you wake up in the morning you're not looking for a raise you're looking for a different kind of raise you're looking for a raise out of here you know he he know you're not just looking for an earthly job you're looking for what works would you have me to do so it it it changes their mind it quickens their mind and and that that's a beautiful thing because if you get trapped between these two worlds you can't serve two masters if if you don't understand especially in this hour and have this power of god's word quicken your whole mental understanding of this day in this hour to be able to recognize it you will start to be on the verge of insanity someone sent me something the other day and and i started to read it and i i just said like you know i can't take this stuff anymore it it burdens me how far men have gotten away from god the standard of christianity is so low that you you got to understand we can't think about it but you go back a hundred years they would arrest a woman and put her in jail that's right if she went down the street in her underclothes which is a whole lot more closed than anything they were today but it slipped so far you understand there's only one thing that's going to keep us in that if there's a quickening power from almighty god that comes down on our minds our minds our mental thought process has got to be brought alive so it's the thought process of the word not always a battle between what they say or what satan says or the news says and what the word says what the psychologist says and what propaganda says i don't want none of that stuff take all that away from me let the mind that was in christ be in me amen satan offered him all the kingdoms he didn't even look for a piece of it even moses he gave it all up why a mind was quickened in him that he all of a sudden his mind was changed he didn't see a mud dauber he didn't see a slave he didn't see nationality he didn't see upbringing he didn't see language he saw sons and daughters of god that's what he saw this world that tries to point to all this other stuff oh let the mind that was in christ be in me that i look upon every other man's needs more than i own that's the mind that's what he's got to quicken he's got to quicken the mind first what does it do if he quickens your spirit and you still think like him we always kid davey that his cat's a dog it wasn't a dog that had a puppy mind in it well that's what you'd be nebuchadnezzar what did he do he gave him a mind of the beast right when grew up things sat and ate grass let me tell you you i do i need the quickening power of god on my mind i need my mind transformed into the word of god i've got to get rid of all these all these conspiracy theories all these plans all these ideas i've had let let my think let this mind be in you that was in christ so it even quickened their mind now look how can you say that the spirit dwells in you that's a good question i want this answer how can you the spirit goes in though you've done everything that you thought was right here is your evidence whether you got it or not this is beautiful let's don't use this the way that we always use it oh you know if you've got if you believe the message i know a lot of people that are led of the spirit that don't know the message yet amen i believe god's leading them to it amen amen you said whether you've got it or not if the spirit that was in christ is in you it also quickens you to the word another it makes it alive in you the word alive which is christ jesus it doesn't get you to quicken you to believe the way somebody else believes or a group of believers or the latest thing that's going to bring the church into the rapture you know how many doctrines and moves of the spirit that i've seen that's supposed to produce the rapture it's not produced by man there's only one thing that produces the rapture it's the same spirit that was in jesus christ god giving that to you and when he gives you that spirit he gives you rapture whether it quickens you to the word for he is the word in other words does it bring is does it bring you closer does is the love of god shed abroad in your heart by the spirit do you have a pattern of good works is the spirit that pleading you yeah does it cause confusion do you got gossip on your lips somebody does something and says something that's what i say if we call for women we call it gossip for men we call it backbiting i think we got a whole lot more backbiters than we do gossipers you can you see what i'm trying to say measure that spirit right there right on the spot is this spirit that it's affecting me that i want to talk that i want to judge that i want to criticize did you see you see what she was wearing oh did you hear something oh such and such made this promise to this person there's death in the camp how do you know you've got it does it lead you to the word does it lead you to compassion does it lead you to com pity oh i've got to hurry up i haven't even got to what i want to talk about it to you word for he is the word and if it's contrary and quickens you away from the word then it isn't the spirit of christ you understand it's not it's not something that you can write out formula over here and said i've done this it's a if it's a spirit and it's quick and it's on going every day every day you're presented and you say is this leading me away from christ or is it leading me to christ is it leading me to the word to act like christ or is it leading me away from the word and if it's leading you away from the word then you don't want any part of it but see once we think it's doctrine then we say oh i i know i believe in the message i can be just a big old gossip and i can condemn everybody and i i can put all the baptists in hell and all the methodists in hell you know there's only one person you have to worry about whether they're going to hell or not and that's you [Applause] that's right work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you decide what you want to live like and be like you've got a sure word amen he said so it's not it's not something you join it's it's in your mind it's a filter that a thinking man's filter the word of god filtering everything every day in your life he said if it isn't the spirit of christ cares what you've done until that moves you in the word i don't care what you've done until the spirit that's in you moves you into the word it's religion they have it up there so when i add my own comments you know the difference my sheep hear my voice and they shall live by every word every word i was talking on that the other day and then brother brown talks the story about the dream of his his mother had about the woman walking down the highway in the high heels i'm not going to go through all that but let's jump to paragraph 239. yeah and and the brothers talked about this yesterday and i'm going to make some comments on some of the things they said but one of the brothers brought up how serious this is you know that we get to the place that we think that we were hedged about and that's what they accused job of oh you're just hedged about god said okay i'll take down the hedge i know this man i know the integrity of his heart that's pretty good i don't want my heads taken down but listen she just obeyed everything but one word see everything but one word sure pentecostal woman can be saved sanctified and filled with the holy ghost and then fail why do you think he's saying that now listen and then fail you can't fail to move on with god's word god is moving he's dealing with hearts he's dealing with minds he's dealing with lives he's trying to take us and take this elect lady as the evil hour gets worsen to where god's got not going to be able to dwell with the spirits of men anymore and they're going to cross the day of judgment so he's still calling he's still restoring and and so you've got to get serious if you got the tv kick it out get rid of some of this stuff apply the token and that goes for me too and fail absolutely men shall not live by bread alone but every word that proceedeth word that precedeth see see she failed it and as i said see see she would have went on in all right but she failed to listen see she was on her way to heaven on this highway towards the gates and he said you can't go there in them shoes she was on her way and she would have made it but she didn't listen so she was spirit-filled she did everything she said i can walk in this road he says you can but you can't do it with them shoes and off she went and you know what happened it got narrower you see the statue of a perfect man it gets narrower you don't think this road's getting narrower yeah narrow is the way but broad is the way to destruction and many be on there that'll help you but she failed she failed to listen telling her what was ahead she failed to listen telling her what is ahead look at the spirit of god is telling us it's time not to be lukewarm time to get serious it's time to apply the token it's time to put prayer back in your life it's time to put reading the bible back in your life it's time to pick good works back in your life it's time to put the love and care of your brother's sisters back in your life it's time to bridle your tongues he wrote the gospel by his disciples apostles in doctrine of the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen i think i'll play our portion tonight because i won't keep you too i'm just i got i'm just going to go another few paragraphs yes sir now notice this quickening power zoe remember it isn't zoe he said man something that moves through you notice this quickening power it's moving it's moving that's why you've got to understand denominational pentecostalism is a like a one-time anointing that you're stuck in this leadership of the holy spirit is god's quickening power it's going to quicken your mind and he's going to lead you and break the word to you and show you things to come that's what he told them take no thought for what you say don't build a fence don't build a creed don't build a doctrine don't build a religion because the spirit of god will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness which all the spirit of god is is jesus christ the same person in spirit form not a second person he says now notice this quickening zoe bringing the word the mind that was in christ was in you then this is what that spirit does oh let's sit on this just a second what's the quickening power going to do it's going to put the mind that was in christ in you now we're just going to we're just going to go on it if we maybe we could title this sermon the transformation of our mind okay that's what it's going to do it's going to it's going to put that mind that was in christ was then in you i'm trying to show you that that he's preached all this way and he's trying i'm trying to show you something i'm trying to i want to show you something i want to show you that now so he's going to say now listen to what i'm going to say to you in the next few minutes he went through this whole story and he said they don't listen how many times has something said and you go you're out of the service you're not connected with the anointing you're not connected with the preacher you're not connected with the word somewhere along the line you dropped out you just start to train yourself lock in i hate to use sports as an analysis but all these great athletes they call it don't they call it zoning out or zoning in they they they're locked in you ought to look at their face there's nobody in the world one thing going on amen the guys that can stay like that are those who are successful amen the guys who open their minds to every little thought every little idea every little distraction every little thing they can't focus they can't concentrate they don't know what to think they don't know what they're gonna do and they don't know the outcome it's time we know the outcome of what we say and what we do what time is it oh my goodness i'm sorry you can leave i gotta just do this another 30 minutes i mean this sermon is two and a half hours long and it's taken us eight weeks to get halfway through so we just can't say it like he says it he says when god raised jesus from the dead he raised you up also now he's going to tell us something let's just follow this through and also quickened to life with him you are now quickened to life although then you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god saw all in him at the finish when god looked down upon that body now and i i just thought this was wonderful brother tim shared this with us at the men's breakfast and if you can make those men breakfast there's only once a month you ought to come out but we were talking about the statue of a perfect man now we're all trying to become in that statue of a perfect man right but all of that is in him you understand none of that's coming from you you don't have faith in you it's a gift of god you don't have virtue or strength it's a gift of god all those things god has to give you so they're all in him so let's say you're on this ladder of life and you only get as far as temperance right but when he comes if all the farther you are as temperance he brings the rest of it with him that's what it says in philippians one and six he who begin the good work in you will perform it unto the end in other words he'll finish it you don't have to be sitting here saying oh i better get to the capstone no he'll finish it so you can't judge somebody for where they're at [Music] you oh they're not this they don't have that he's got it he's got it and if you just happen to think that you know that they need it you know where you start working right get the beam out before you work on the sliver but he brings it he finishes the work he completes it if he started it i'll finish it it comes with him so so when he looked upon the body now this is so beautiful and maybe we'll get a little past this and that will be good the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane now you didn't have anything but a man he was the son of god he was spotless else he couldn't have been a sacrifice but listen the spirit the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which was human flesh and he didn't if he went up there as god he would have never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't have to do it now this is what i wanted to preach this morning just get into my sermon now remember now this is such a blessing to us this morning i i know i'm not going to be able to express it the way it means to me but remember when he went there with you in him see god had not separated the bride from the groom there's no bride there was no gentile bride that other church lived under the law of sin and death right that's where they live they were under the law of sin and death but now so he when he was there the bride wasn't separated yet so don't get hung up on yourself when he looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female so he saw you and him it was all redeemed in that one body see they are one same same word the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride now think of that so he saw the bride in christ so all the scriptures that spoke of him spoke of you because they weren't separated yet and that's what he told us all that he is we are look it hasn't been separated well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him so in other words the same scripture so if it was promised of him it was promised of us because you're a part of him everything that pertains to him pertains to you because you died there also [Music] he more the chastisement he bore the stripes but you bore the benefits so when he died you died with him when he rose you rose with him [Music] the only difference was you weren't separated out yet it was all completed in him but now he's got to separate her out right so the first adam was what a living soul and what came out of him eve a natural living soul the second adam was what a quickening spirit and what came out of him eternal life an eternal bride came out of him for the gift of god is what eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's god and he is the what so if this never was jesus and everybody following him it always was jesus and his bride she came out of she went into the ground and then she came out believers came out in justification they came out they came out until the last days glory so it's a quick so they were they were came under the law of sin and death but we come under the okay in romans we come under the law of liberty and life in christ jesus he said so he said now let's greet he says he says and the groom and he wouldn't be the bride and he did everything even to prove it by raising himself from the dead afterwards then don't the black have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in the last days so if he rose from the dead she's got to rise from the dead because when he rose you rose with him you have to do the same thing that's why he said when he rose you rose what are we scared of the only thing you're spared of is because you're not your life isn't bearing witness to the quickening power and you're in conflict you love the lord and you're trying to balance the love of god and the love of the world that's the curse of lady osea lukewarm let's just read a few more paragraphs and then your dinner will taste better than ever she'll have exactly what the word said she would be in the last day don't she have to return to malachi 4. i will restore what's he restoring well i'll just save that we'll just get moved read this don't the word don't the world have to be just exactly like it is what a mess isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us he's making it known to you now think of it you haven't been separated out yet at calvary but now you're what being separated out and i want to end this morning with this thought look notice this but god saw the bride in the groom hallelujah see to save his wife like adam he had to go with her adam knew what he was doing he didn't know what she was doing but adam walked out with his wife and jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he become you and stood your punishment that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we deny it how can we do anything but love him friend i should stay on for hours but let's move on a little bit look the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy ghost in the last days as a promise is like the abstract to the title deed now the baptism of the holy spirit is one thing and now he's talking about an abstract being another thing now when when you uh when you heard the gospel and the word of god was preached to you and you heard you were a sinner and you felt convicted and you heard you've heard the news and you you heard about jesus dying on calvary and and you heard those things you said i believe that okay and you claim it as yours okay that's my promise that's uh i believe that that's my faith i believe there's a heaven i believe i'm going there that is a title okay so you've got that you believe it you've heard it you believed it and you lay claim to it as yours so you have a title that you've written that says this is my promise this is my land you have the title but what he's talking about for this age is something beyond a title it's beyond your faith but yet it is your faith he said he says now you you can get a title sure and you can get a title to a place but that still don't say it's yours so what happens when you just get the title i'm saved satan lays claim on that he says no you're not you did this you did that this is mine no no you're not you're not going and you're in a conflict because you've laid claim to it that it's yours but you can't take possession of it because the title alone don't give it to you so you're always battling with the flesh you're always fighting your desires everything that comes along turns your head you know what i mean your ears are just itching this is beautiful you've laid hold of it as if it's yours but the adversary now is contending for it so let's read listen what happens he says sure you can have you can have you can say it's yours no sir somebody way back yonders comes in and puts a claim on it so what does satan do he goes back yonder he's the accuser of the brethren so now he's laying claim to it he said no you don't have it you're still mine and he keeps producing evidence because you've just got a title so you got you've got to have a title oh you don't have nothing but you understand god's doing something amen this is something that god's doing listen amen remember the seals and he opened the book what was that all about what did man lose they lost the title right and nobody could open the book but he came and opened the book now he was the possessor of the title d he had the original which was the abstract the original what was really written in the lamb's book of life he had it he's the only one that can what give it look he said so so he says he says but somebody back yonder can come and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything that's ever against it strike off plumb back from the foundation so in other words an abstract is there's a piece of property and all of a sudden you come in and you take this piece of property and you define it you say this corner to this corner to this corner to this corner that's when it's created the original description of that property its original creation is called the abstract it was abstracted or taken the original abstract was you because you were taken from him that's the original abstract so now that with the title deed just holding the promise he can come and tell you you weren't part of the original but when the abstract comes when the quickening power comes when the same spirit that was in him comes it takes you all the way back to your original existence plum back to the foundation it's not it's that's why so many of us go through so much trouble we're hanging on to the abstract i mean we're hanging under the title ask him for the abstract amen ask him for the spirit that goes with the land you're trying to hold a piece of land in another kingdom hold your kingdom land in his kingdom my kingdom's not of this world you are not of this world we got to quit trying to fit in can i have 15 more minutes and if i'm a liar pray for me so when a man believes the word that's his title okay but satan he's always trying to steal that from you it causes us to backslide it causes us to doubt we've never settled it you understand this is the age of restoration malachi 4. remember we just let it through malachi 4 he comes back and he gives you the abstract he gives you the eternal life that you possessed with him in the beginning now you're not believing it i hope this isn't shocking but i believe this message a long time with the with the title but i just think a few months ago that i got my abstract i mean it's something like i can't even comprehend the battle is gone the temptation's there because that's what he is you know what i mean but i don't got to put him in my pocket it's it's it's over it's finished but let's just read this i mean i i i've been i i've been in this two weeks just everything ties together how he's brought us back why he took this back to the beginning why he told us where we were what the brother branham's message was the only message that held the abstract it was the only word that brought the spirit that brought you back to your original creation amen you say well i what happens if i only got the title hang on to it he's got the rest of it right if you've just got faith you hang on to faith and tell virtues at it and it conveys you just saying you hang on to it till patience is added and knowledge is added and you just keep hanging on and he keeps adding and adding an edit and one day he caps it off he gives you that love he gives you that spirit you the struggle goes away you can actually say i'm risen because he lives i live also the suffering doesn't bother you you know that that he has finally seals you and tells you i've got eternal life we we work too much on it as being a baptism it's beyond the baptism do you understand if he had you in his thinking you will be there nothing can take you out of the book of life the abstract's yours don't just settle for the title take it all the way back tell them that's right i just don't want the promises that that say that this land's mine i just don't want the description of the land i i just don't want to know what the borders of the kingdom are and all i can do i want to take full possession and i want it to be mine now listen too many people with the title deed say he possesses it he's the possessor of healing he's the possessor of forgiveness he's the possessor he's the possessor he's the possessor but if you were in him everything that he is you are no longer is he the possessor but you're the possessor [Music] why because he gave you the same spirit that was in him [Applause] you know why the world keeps them at calvary because they don't understand the bride being separated you know why they don't understand the bride being separated they didn't listen malachi 4 5 came to restore back the abstract to the church that clock's wrong now oh okay so it takes you plum back to the foundation giving you what was yours what you always had see as a sinner we're always struggling but if you get the abstract it says wait a minute i i've always been i'm a part of the whole expression of god me and him are one so what he does with the abstract he had all the abstract in him so we looked at him having the book and we said he's everything i need he's everything i need but now you've got to understand you're his bride so he doesn't just want to be the one that possesses everything he wants you to possess what he has so he opens the book reveals how satan has kept it from us how he's kept us all through these ages until in this last hour he can finally return the abstract back to the believer and they too become the sons and daughters of god doing the same thing he did [Music] now listen to how beautiful it gets next paragraph and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy ghost comes it's the abstract to the title and gives you permission i am what he is the abstract gives me position permission to lay my hands on the sin it gives me permission to cast out devils it gives me positions to preach the gospel it gives me position oh we had a ministry that did everything for us but once you get the abstract you are christ [Applause] you're anointed you say how can it be because you were in him at calvary what's he been doing he's been separating her out until this last day through malachi 4 5 that it restores back the abstract to the believer and they become true sons and daughters of god just as he's the son and daughter of god and now you've got permission the title don't give you permission you got to ask you've got to ask when you go home you call you call you know i don't call my mother and ask her if i can open my refrigerator i'm commissioned when you go into that upper room you're going to get the abstract and with that abstract you go into all the world you preach the gospel you lay hands on the sick you cast out devils i'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness he says you got permission when you have the abstract that every bit that belongs every bit of that belongs to you and everything is on it belongs to you amen and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this title deed that god saw back yonder for the foundations of the world and put its name on the lam on the book of life and was born through men and women and i could just preach on this whole paragraph for a long time but i won't man and woman and subject to sin and guilt of sin but when i believed on it i received the deed you see when i believed on it i received the deed now baptism of the holy spirit as we know it is part of the deed what this message brings us is the abstract the description of the original property boundaries it's creation all that's in it is in the abstract you believe it's there but now he returns the abstract to you you receive he says you believe it you receive the deed but when the holy ghost comes it's the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandfather done it he said like the little epileptic child i paid for a few minutes ago comes through the grandparents the epilepsy fell down upon the child he said but the abstract has come and it's all struck off so if everything struck off what are you returning back to you're returning back to the original amen why are we why aren't we going there because this is the call of the spirit return back to the original the call is there people think they're it's like man always does they always want to manifest it in the flesh they think it might be a shout they think it might be a run but it's beyond that you understand it's individual it comes in sight it's finally settled you're not working for your salvation anymore there's nothing laid to the charge of god's elect this he's only the accuser of the brethren but hear me there is nothing laid to the charge of god's elect when you get this it doesn't i don't some people come from broken homes some people don't know who the real daddy and mother is that that was all the questions under the title indeed but when the abstract comes he identifies you beyond your grandparents did you hear what he said beyond what your mother did so your mother had you out of wedlock it goes beyond come on it goes beyond them all of that's thrown away it takes you back to the book of life so many people and here's all preachers trying to fix your situation and deal with it and make excuses and it don't matter when he gives it to you it don't matter you've got permission you've got permission to claim your children you've got position to claim your mother you've got permission to claim all things you have permission to think the way he thinks you know how he thought he gave his life for the whole world that all men should be saved it's not my father's will that any man should perish you know church god's wanting to give us that sold out abstract it it's you've had the title that's why we're here but you understand it's not it's not like you got to have it now it doesn't matter it's in him what he is doing in this last day this last hour this last move of the bride he is distributing the abstract deed to each individual bride member that they have the same power and resurrection in them that he had and it's settled amen hallelujah there's so much more good things do you say well what's going to what's going to determine the who i'm going to lay my hands on what's going to determine the works i do the mind of christ you got permission your heart starts to be you've got permission to go knock on your neighbor's door and i'd like to sure tell you you got permission to sit down and say where should i get my hair cut i told that lady i said you know i don't have any koreans in my church yet i went to korea in 19 in 70 six first place i ever went overseas i don't think that was a mistake god wants to use you church he loves you he wants you to be a part of he wants us to stand up and be who we are aren't you sick of this satan using your flesh against you amen i i could go into all the part about an eagle and all that stuff but church praise god it's abstract time that would be a good title to the sermon too i anyway i can't quit so the best way to do it is give it to billy god bless you [Applause] amen that's wonderful amen i believe we've been in a special meeting this morning amen i believe our hearts on flame this morning amen amen that's our stand sister laura
