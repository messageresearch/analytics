[12:49] [Music]
[13:06] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord once
[13:09] again for this assembly Lord we're able
[13:11] to gather together under
[13:12] [Music]
[13:13] the shed blood of a of a perfect
[13:16] sacrifice Lord
[13:18] realizing Lord it wasn't our
[13:20] righteousness that you died for but Lord
[13:22] it was
[13:24] your predestinated word Lord
[13:28] we thank you this morning we appreciate
[13:31] it we love you
[13:32] Lord we ask that
[13:35] Lord nothing would come in these doors
[13:37] that would hinder the movement of your
[13:39] Holy Spirit there might be Freedom here
[13:40] this morning Lord for you to work your
[13:42] will in your way in our lives Lord Lord
[13:45] by the preaching of the word we know
[13:47] Lord that the purification the washing
[13:50] of the water of the word prepares that
[13:52] sacrifice
[13:53] so Lord we lay ourselves down at your
[13:55] altar this morning pray there's any need
[13:58] in the body Lord that it would be met
[14:00] but Lord when we leave here then we'd be
[14:03] much better off with the kingdom of
[14:05] Heaven's Sake that's our desire this
[14:06] morning Lord is to move up and closer to
[14:08] you as we give you all the honor and the
[14:10] glory and the praise that you so richly
[14:12] deserve we ask these things in the
[14:14] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:15] amen
[14:18] amen Let's Be The Name Of The Lord
[14:20] [Music]
[14:23] let's open our Bibles to Psalm number
[14:26] 90.
[14:32] I got up this morning
[14:34] not really knowing what I was gonna
[14:36] try to prepare to read I've read over a
[14:38] few scriptures and many things you want
[14:41] to bring out in the word of the Lord
[14:43] make beneficial
[14:47] but I got to thinking
[14:51] on Moses
[14:54] and not knowing
[14:57] my Bible titles psalm 90.
[15:00] as a prayer of Moses
[15:04] or a Psalm of Moses that's what we're
[15:06] going to read this morning
[15:08] and I reflected and started reading over
[15:10] in Chronicles
[15:12] realizing
[15:16] that it's not our our righteousness
[15:19] excuse me I said Chronicles I meant
[15:21] Deuteronomy if you'll read Deuteronomy 9
[15:25] and Moses
[15:33] you know up until the time the coming of
[15:35] the Lord Jesus there was not a prophet
[15:37] like in the Moses
[15:43] face to face with God
[15:48] let me read just a a short portion
[15:51] to remind us where we stand and how
[15:54] humble we ought to be before the Lord
[15:58] foreign
[16:03] years of suffering in the wilderness
[16:06] God brought his children out with the
[16:08] mighty hand the land of Egypt we all
[16:10] know they're about to cross the Jordan
[16:12] here's what Moses had to say
[16:15] hear o Israel Thou Art the Passover
[16:18] Jordan This Day
[16:23] we're about to pass over our Jordan
[16:24] today
[16:26] to go into possessive Nations greater
[16:28] and mightier than thyself cities Great
[16:32] and fenced up to heaven a people great
[16:35] and Tall the children of the anakims
[16:37] whom thou knowest and of whom thou has
[16:39] heard say who can stand before the
[16:40] children of Enoch understand therefore
[16:43] this day that the Lord thy God
[16:47] is he which goeth over before thee as a
[16:51] consuming fire he shall destroy them and
[16:53] he shall bring them down before thy face
[16:55] so shalt thou drive them out and Destroy
[16:59] them quickly as the Lord has said unto
[17:01] thee
[17:02] it's big not thou in thine heart after
[17:04] that the Lord thy God hath cast him out
[17:06] from before thee saying we don't want to
[17:08] be puffed up now listen for my
[17:11] righteousness the Lord hath
[17:13] brought me in to possess this land
[17:16] but for the wickedness
[17:19] of these nations the Lord have driven
[17:22] have dried them out Duck Drive them out
[17:24] from before thee not for thy
[17:27] righteousness or for the uprightness of
[17:29] thine heart
[17:30] thus thou go to possess their land but
[17:32] for the wickedness of these nations the
[17:35] Lord thy God doth drive them out from
[17:36] before thee that he may perform the word
[17:39] which the Lord swear unto thy fathers
[17:41] Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh my
[17:45] but if you read over in Galatians Paul
[17:47] begins to talk about a new New Covenant
[17:51] a better Covenant that the blood of
[17:54] bulls and goats could come back upon a
[17:56] man but there was one perfect sacrifice
[17:59] that was given it's not by our
[18:01] righteousness but by us his
[18:03] righteousness man the word of the Lord
[18:05] says in him we live and move and have
[18:07] our being
[18:09] says and in him dwelleth the fullness of
[18:13] the godhead bodily
[18:15] and we heard just recently Brothers said
[18:17] he put those two scriptures together in
[18:19] my mind he said you are a portion of the
[18:21] body of Christ in the age that you're
[18:23] living in now think of that he's not
[18:25] going to forsake himself he chose a
[18:27] bride he spoke a bride
[18:30] he fills that bride and he Weds that
[18:32] bride I mean then he goes to live
[18:34] forever with that bride amen what a
[18:37] blessing what a blessing
[18:39] I want to read something that a few
[18:41] weeks ago I was up here and I felt like
[18:43] I wanted to read it and I just didn't do
[18:46] it but I feel like the time is right
[18:48] this morning to do it maybe it'll help
[18:49] someone here
[18:51] and brother Brahm is speaking in
[18:52] Redemption by judgment
[18:54] and prior to his message
[18:57] sometimes he tells a little story an
[18:59] event and it just precedes a point that
[19:02] he wants to bring out and is so edifying
[19:04] and blessing to us if we're just mind
[19:07] what he has to say here
[19:12] and he's talking about ups and downs he
[19:13] said oh if you just had my ups and downs
[19:16] and he said a little lady visited a
[19:18] certain doctor here not long ago and the
[19:20] little doctor was a cursing and a
[19:22] jumping up and down and carrying on
[19:25] the lady said to him I wouldn't do that
[19:27] if I was in your place doctor
[19:31] it sounds astounding that a woman would
[19:32] tell the doctor that he said if you had
[19:34] my worries well you'd do it too
[19:37] he said or she said oh I have as many
[19:40] words as you and I don't do it anyhow
[19:43] so that got the doctor right in the
[19:46] right place that's right he respected
[19:49] the little lady ever since
[19:51] that's it and this I think when he was
[19:54] coming to
[19:55] just a word in season will do it see no
[19:59] matter what your worries is
[20:00] what your Temptations are stand on God's
[20:04] word when all everything seems to be
[20:06] going wrong stand on God's word peace
[20:09] said so amen may that be a comfort to us
[20:12] psalm 90.
[20:13] what a blessing if you look at verse 17
[20:16] it says let the beauty of the Lord Our
[20:18] God be upon us
[20:20] in Psalms 27 David talked about going to
[20:22] the house of the Lord
[20:24] flip over here quickly he says
[20:28] for I have desired one thing have I
[20:31] desired of the Lord that I will seek
[20:32] after then I may dwell in the house of
[20:34] the Lord all the days of my life to
[20:36] behold the beauty of the Lord and
[20:39] inquiring his Temple amen it's beautiful
[20:41] this morning let's read it together if
[20:43] we would Lord thou Hast been our
[20:46] Dwelling Place in all generations before
[20:48] the mountains were brought forth or ever
[20:51] thou has formed the earth and the world
[20:53] even from Everlasting to Everlasting
[20:56] Thou Art God thou turnest man to
[20:59] destruction and say Us return ye
[21:02] Children of Men for a thousand years in
[21:05] thy sight are but as yesterday when it
[21:07] is passed and as a watch in the night
[21:10] thou carries them away as with the flood
[21:12] they are as asleep in the morning they
[21:15] are like grass which groweth up in the
[21:18] morning it flourisheth and groweth up in
[21:20] the evening it is cut down and withering
[21:22] for we are consumed by thine anger and
[21:25] by thy wrath are we troubled thou has
[21:28] sent our iniquities before thee our
[21:30] secret sins of the light of thy
[21:32] countenance for all our days are passed
[21:35] away in thy wrath we spend our years as
[21:37] a tale that is told the days of our
[21:40] years are three score years and ten and
[21:42] if my reason of strength day before
[21:44] score Years yet is their strength labor
[21:47] and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we
[21:50] fly away who knoweth the power of thine
[21:53] anger even according to thy fear so is
[21:56] thy wrath so teach us to number our days
[21:59] that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom
[22:01] return O Lord how long and let it repent
[22:05] thee concerning thy servants o satisfy
[22:08] us early with thy mercy that we may
[22:10] rejoice and be glad all our days make us
[22:14] glad according to the days wherein thou
[22:16] has Afflicted us and the years wherein
[22:18] we have seen evil let thy Work appear
[22:21] unto thy servants and thy Glory unto
[22:24] their children and let the beauty of the
[22:26] Lord Our God be upon us and establish
[22:29] now the work of our hands upon us yea
[22:32] the work of our hands established thou
[22:34] yet blessed be the name of the Lord

[31:16] and a special even if he could come at
[31:19] this time
[31:55] it's joking
[32:02] God bless you
[32:04] my brethren
[32:06] God bless you
[32:10] I have a short testimony and
[32:13] I wrote it down
[32:15] because you know
[32:17] I don't speak
[32:21] fluent English
[32:25] it is very difficult for me to stand
[32:29] before you
[32:30] at this moment
[32:33] there is something that is hard for me
[32:36] to do
[32:37] is to say
[32:39] A Farewell message
[32:43] I was here in America for 10 long years
[32:48] and it's full of struggles
[32:51] nobody knows but me
[32:55] I don't have
[32:56] any desire
[32:58] coming here in this country because
[33:02] I foresee the things that I'll get
[33:05] through here
[33:07] and it's still until now
[33:11] just please pray for me
[33:14] and if you ever want to pray for me
[33:18] it's not to have Bridges
[33:21] or to be known
[33:24] but just pray
[33:27] that I can stay in the hands of Christ
[33:31] that it can mold me
[33:34] and use me in any way
[33:37] that this is fit me to do
[33:40] I'll pray the same thing for you my
[33:43] brother
[33:44] and before I leave
[33:46] I want to leave a message
[33:49] I urge you to always pray and love
[33:53] our pastor
[33:55] Brother David
[33:58] I love him so dearly
[34:00] he's more than a brother to me in place
[34:05] I owe him many wonderful things
[34:09] that he engraved in my heart
[34:12] and I may never forget it all my life
[34:18] let me share to you a very relevant
[34:21] passage that I copied from a Christian
[34:27] about being a pastor
[34:30] it is not isitas
[34:33] a pastor is a
[34:35] preacher
[34:36] a Shepherd a steward a burden beer
[34:42] a guidance counselor
[34:45] an Innkeeper
[34:47] a Peter of the black
[34:50] a nurturer of faith
[34:52] a prayer Warrior
[34:55] a director of Church events
[34:59] and moderator between grieving parties
[35:04] a peace negotiator
[35:06] a security office
[35:09] a manager of church resources
[35:13] a song leader
[35:16] and sometimes a janitor as well
[35:20] let us love our pastor
[35:23] and pray for him
[35:25] without the pastor the local church will
[35:29] be in chaos and confusion
[35:32] an evangelist can be
[35:35] a fireball
[35:37] a teacher can offer you deep wisdom
[35:41] an apostle can do
[35:44] Mission field
[35:46] a prophet can prophesy and see visions
[35:50] but none can compare the workload
[35:55] a workload of a pastor is the ox of the
[36:00] team
[36:01] I thank the Lord for this great
[36:03] privilege and honor
[36:05] fellowshipping with you to worship Him
[36:08] and serving the lord
[36:10] and Gathering like this
[36:13] God bless you
[36:16] I want to
[36:21] sing a special to my Lord

[55:50] morning
[55:52] our heavenly father
[55:55] you know our hearts
[55:58] you know our struggles you know our
[56:00] battles you know our weaknesses
[56:05] father you know
[56:09] how futile our
[56:12] efforts are and
[56:14] how weak and unable we are
[56:20] even to overcome the smallest things
[56:24] [Music]
[56:27] but Lord we believe that your grace and
[56:31] your mercy is sufficient for us
[56:34] and that your strength is made perfect
[56:36] in our weaknesses
[56:39] and father we look to that great
[56:41] Fountain this morning of love
[56:45] that you have for us that you are
[56:47] mindful of us
[56:49] lord it's beyond our comprehension why
[56:53] that you would lay down your life for
[56:55] such as
[56:56] we are father but you so love the world
[57:02] you gave us a kinsman redeemer
[57:05] and he was faithful and true
[57:09] and revealed you to us father in the
[57:12] greatness that you are
[57:14] and we are so grateful for that this
[57:17] morning we just ask that you'd help us
[57:19] and bless us
[57:20] we ask these things this morning
[57:23] in Jesus precious and wonderful name we
[57:27] pray amen
[57:30] God bless you this morning if you have
[57:32] your Bibles let's turn over to Matthew
[57:35] the 17th chapter in
[57:39] we're just going to see how this morning
[57:41] goes I'd like to play a little portion
[57:43] of sermon for us this morning
[57:47] um also it's uh
[57:51] you know like you say kind of
[57:54] Bittersweet in many ways to see brother
[57:58] James and sister Ellen and brother anafu
[58:00] and sister Mercedes go back to the
[58:03] Philippines but they came over here and
[58:06] they worked for so many years until they
[58:09] could get their retirement
[58:11] and while we were here
[58:14] many days
[58:17] I would sit with brother James and he
[58:20] would just pour its heart out to me
[58:22] about his son and and uh you know how
[58:27] broken-hearted he was his son wasn't
[58:30] serving the lord and I remember one day
[58:33] in the office we prayed together and and
[58:36] we just
[58:38] determined in our heart that we are
[58:40] going to win that victory
[58:42] and now his son got converted and
[58:46] preaching the gospel and has a church
[58:50] so I mean it's marvelous for him to go
[58:54] back you know I I I've never had any
[58:57] desire
[58:59] ever in my heart to go to the
[59:01] Philippines I I don't know why I'm
[59:05] but now I've got a reason if I ever to
[59:09] go there so uh We've watched God do a
[59:12] lot of things and a great love and
[59:15] and the great humility of our brother
[59:17] and we're certainly going to miss him
[59:20] but you know he's a part of us and
[59:23] that's the beautiful thing about this
[59:25] message once you really have it in your
[59:28] heart it binds you together to Believers
[59:31] like you just can't believe it it really
[59:34] makes us one body amen so let's read
[59:37] this morning and we're just going to
[59:39] Fellowship I have no idea what direction
[59:42] uh we're gonna go this morning I just
[59:44] have a little something on my heart that
[59:47] I'd like to share play a little portion
[59:49] of tape and
[59:50] just it says in the 17th chapter of the
[59:54] Book of Matthew and and we know that
[59:58] right before this and the 16th chapter
[1:00:01] is where uh Peter makes the great
[1:00:06] profession that out the Christ the son
[1:00:09] of the Living God and and Jesus says
[1:00:12] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this
[1:00:14] to you but my Father which is in heaven
[1:00:17] and he said and Upon
[1:00:20] This Rock I'll build my church and we
[1:00:24] know that's the divine revelation of who
[1:00:26] that he is
[1:00:27] it says now after six days Jesus
[1:00:31] taketh Peter James in John his brother
[1:00:36] and bringeth them up unto the high
[1:00:39] mountain apart now our messenger says
[1:00:43] that Peter represented Faith James
[1:00:46] represented hope and John represented
[1:00:50] love every Christian ought to go with
[1:00:53] faith
[1:00:54] hope and love in their heart so there
[1:00:58] was three Witnesses on Earth
[1:01:00] he says and he was transfigured before
[1:01:03] them and his face did shine as the sun
[1:01:07] and his Remnant was white as the light
[1:01:11] and behold there appeared
[1:01:14] unto them Moses and Elijah talking with
[1:01:18] him that's our three Witnesses in heaven
[1:01:21] then answered Peter and said unto Jesus
[1:01:24] Lord it is good for us to be here if
[1:01:29] that will let us make thee three
[1:01:31] Tabernacles one for thee and one for
[1:01:35] Moses and one for Elias
[1:01:38] and while yet he spoke Behold a bright
[1:01:41] Cloud overshadowed them and behold a
[1:01:44] voice out of the cloud which said this
[1:01:48] is my beloved Son
[1:01:51] in whom I am well pleased hear ye Him
[1:01:58] Father we ask you to bless your word to
[1:02:00] us and your precious name we pray amen
[1:02:04] you may be seated this morning
[1:02:10] we're drawing our inspiration this
[1:02:12] morning uh from the message that our
[1:02:15] messenger preached in Spokane Washington
[1:02:19] uh on July 11th
[1:02:22] um
[1:02:23] 1962
[1:02:25] and the the sermon is hear ye him
[1:02:29] and uh
[1:02:32] I certainly believe that's something
[1:02:35] that we need to do more than ever is
[1:02:38] hear ye him
[1:02:39] and so we like just a fellowship a
[1:02:42] little bit this morning and at to
[1:02:46] encourage us a little bit about how we
[1:02:49] hear from them how does God speak to you
[1:02:52] how does he talk to you we know that he
[1:02:56] speaks to a prophet uh lift a year
[1:03:00] and
[1:03:01] uh we don't always have that uh ability
[1:03:06] because we're not made that way a lot of
[1:03:10] people would think oh I'd like to hear
[1:03:11] God speak to me uh I think you would
[1:03:15] scare
[1:03:16] um
[1:03:17] I don't know the only expression I have
[1:03:19] to scare the liver out of you you know
[1:03:21] what I mean but it would it would be a
[1:03:24] fearful thing to have God speak you know
[1:03:28] we we like it when God's kind of far
[1:03:30] away but uh but a prophet can hear him
[1:03:33] lift the ear some have gifts of Dreams
[1:03:37] some may see Visions uh
[1:03:42] but God has a way that he talks to us
[1:03:46] every day in our life and we just kind
[1:03:50] of want to maybe get to that point in a
[1:03:53] little bit about the necessity of
[1:03:58] understanding that and how that he leads
[1:04:01] you because the footsteps of the
[1:04:04] righteous are LED of the Lord and we
[1:04:07] that's our desire in our heart is to be
[1:04:11] led of the Lord so how does he lead us
[1:04:14] how does he speak to us how does he
[1:04:17] guide us in the everyday
[1:04:20] occurrences of life and we don't ever
[1:04:24] want to get so spiritual that we're of
[1:04:26] no Earth
[1:04:30] is it's a Living Word it actually is
[1:04:34] coming to pass around us every day one
[1:04:38] of the great things of this age that we
[1:04:42] pray for
[1:04:43] especially in this hour of this age that
[1:04:47] we live in this lady you'll see it age
[1:04:49] this time when the world is once again
[1:04:54] is in a Sodom condition
[1:04:57] it is as it was in the days of Noah
[1:05:01] where people are married and given into
[1:05:04] marriage and there's no stability the
[1:05:07] the greatest loss of of the curse of the
[1:05:12] age of Noah and people being married and
[1:05:15] given into marriage is it destroys the
[1:05:18] home it destroys the family value and
[1:05:22] we've noticed a lot in our society right
[1:05:25] now that there's a lot of uproar uh
[1:05:30] because uh
[1:05:32] of what the school systems of the world
[1:05:36] are are teaching children and they now
[1:05:40] they've
[1:05:42] realized that 47 percent of Americas are
[1:05:47] now considering homeschooling their
[1:05:49] children
[1:05:50] because what's being taught but they
[1:05:53] don't understand that they reap this
[1:05:55] right do they turn their kids over to
[1:05:59] the to the stools and they turn them
[1:06:01] over to the public school system and
[1:06:04] they turned them over to society so the
[1:06:07] mothers could work and the fathers could
[1:06:09] work and that they could get their
[1:06:12] houses and their homes and all of a
[1:06:15] sudden now their kids are are showing up
[1:06:18] at their door and and walking into their
[1:06:20] house and saying a mama I don't think
[1:06:23] I'm a girl I think I'm a boy
[1:06:26] you know what I mean and they're
[1:06:28] starting to hear all these things that
[1:06:30] they're being taught and and all of a
[1:06:33] sudden the parents now are desperately
[1:06:35] trying to get back and get control of
[1:06:38] Education to get control of their
[1:06:41] children you know they put them in front
[1:06:44] of the one-eyed monster so so long that
[1:06:47] that they've their thinking has gone
[1:06:50] away and and so the the we realize that
[1:06:54] things are falling apart the problem is
[1:06:57] that it's probably to the point of no
[1:07:00] return
[1:07:02] you know what I'm saying it's gone but
[1:07:05] we're here this morning you took the
[1:07:08] time this morning to uh to prepare and
[1:07:11] come out to church and make the
[1:07:13] sacrifice because you believe there's
[1:07:15] another life you believe in even Beyond
[1:07:18] this life a Christian Life is a good way
[1:07:22] to live if there was no Heavenly reward
[1:07:27] and take this in the way I'm saying it
[1:07:29] if if it was just a matter of what
[1:07:32] lifestyle that you would choose a
[1:07:36] Christian life is still the best life
[1:07:38] there is but added on to this great life
[1:07:41] is eternal life so this is a life that
[1:07:45] we're just getting a foretaste of of to
[1:07:48] this life that we have in Christ Jesus
[1:07:50] is just of foretaste of things to come
[1:07:54] just a little bit of a blessing to us
[1:07:57] the peace The Joy the happiness that's
[1:08:01] her path is understand standing the good
[1:08:03] things of God it is just a foretaste it
[1:08:07] hasn't even entered into the hearts and
[1:08:09] the minds of men the things that God has
[1:08:13] prepared for them that love them
[1:08:16] oh if you think it's good here I'm
[1:08:19] telling you it's I it's it I don't have
[1:08:23] words to describe it I can't even begin
[1:08:26] to utter the glory of the things that
[1:08:29] God's got for his children
[1:08:32] but the great struggle is is we don't
[1:08:35] want to miss it
[1:08:38] we don't want to miss the rapture
[1:08:42] we want to make the rapture we want to
[1:08:45] be serious and and and
[1:08:48] deeply committed
[1:08:51] to making that journey to being prepared
[1:08:56] for that to being enrapturing condition
[1:08:59] if in other words what if it profeth a
[1:09:03] man if he gains the whole world and
[1:09:06] loses his soul the Lord put just such an
[1:09:10] effort out in the years of his ministry
[1:09:13] here on Earth to let us know that there
[1:09:16] is a kingdom there is a land beyond the
[1:09:19] river there is a life worth living for
[1:09:23] that this world is temporary that this
[1:09:27] world will be destroyed that this world
[1:09:30] is not our home in my father's Health
[1:09:33] are many mansions if it were not so I
[1:09:36] would not have told you I go to prepare
[1:09:38] a place for you that where I am you may
[1:09:42] be also and I come again to receive you
[1:09:45] that you might be where I am also and I
[1:09:49] know Christianity Today is getting to be
[1:09:52] something that's foolish because man no
[1:09:55] longer wishes to retain God in it in
[1:09:59] their knowledge
[1:10:01] they don't even want to consider God and
[1:10:04] the more they take God out of their
[1:10:06] thinking the crazier their thinking gets
[1:10:12] yes
[1:10:13] all kinds of places everywhere whatever
[1:10:16] thing comes to their imagination
[1:10:19] but we want to be sober
[1:10:21] we want to be diligent we want to be
[1:10:25] purposed we want to have a clear vision
[1:10:28] and a clear understanding of the path
[1:10:32] that we're on we want our footsteps to
[1:10:35] be ordered by the Lord we don't want to
[1:10:38] just haphazardly live a life and then
[1:10:42] come down at the end of the road and
[1:10:45] look up and say oh what do I get
[1:10:49] no I want to settle it right now amen I
[1:10:53] want to be assured in my heart that I'm
[1:10:56] packing the ticket I want to know beyond
[1:11:00] of a shadow of a doubt that I'm born of
[1:11:02] the spirit of God that there's no
[1:11:05] question again we're not here to uh
[1:11:10] belabor the point we're not here to to
[1:11:13] condemn anybody this morning but what we
[1:11:16] are saying is we want to be able to
[1:11:18] consciously look in the mirror of God
[1:11:21] and ask ourselves am I ready
[1:11:24] am I
[1:11:26] mad do I have that token do I have that
[1:11:30] Blessed assurance and if you don't it's
[1:11:34] freely given
[1:11:35] amen he wants to truly freely give it
[1:11:40] and so I think uh
[1:11:43] one of the great things that is needed
[1:11:47] of all of us individually and as a
[1:11:51] church body is to really recognize the
[1:11:55] day that we live in
[1:11:57] and understand what the message is to us
[1:12:01] as Believers this morning what would it
[1:12:04] be that God would want to deal with our
[1:12:07] hearts about
[1:12:09] what what could we receive of him this
[1:12:12] morning that would focus Us in on what
[1:12:17] we need to be focused in to reveal to us
[1:12:21] the things that are vanity the things
[1:12:24] that aren't worth our effort I always
[1:12:27] Marvel at this kids that spend so many
[1:12:30] days and hours just you know in this
[1:12:35] phony electronic game okay what does it
[1:12:40] pay out
[1:12:42] you know if if you know lots of dollars
[1:12:45] come spewing out of the their phone you
[1:12:49] think well they're doing this for a
[1:12:50] reason but what they've done is they've
[1:12:53] ate up time and they've ate up their
[1:12:56] brain cells and let me say this this
[1:12:59] morning that God has allotted you a
[1:13:02] period of time
[1:13:04] I don't know how many days that he has
[1:13:08] allotted ahead of me he's allotted me 70
[1:13:12] uh of three some years and months and
[1:13:15] hours and days to this point but I'm
[1:13:19] held accountable for the time that God
[1:13:22] gives you and you're held accountable
[1:13:25] for the time what do you use that time
[1:13:27] for and and do you value the time that
[1:13:31] God's given you do you value your life
[1:13:37] and
[1:13:39] it's not too late I don't care how old
[1:13:43] you are it's not too late it's not too
[1:13:46] late for me to have a Revival it's not
[1:13:49] too late for me to reset my course it's
[1:13:53] not too late for me to clean up my life
[1:13:56] and to apply the token and to say that
[1:13:59] with the days that I've got left I'm
[1:14:02] going to use it for the kingdom of God
[1:14:07] but just don't be drifted
[1:14:09] toss to and fro by every wind to
[1:14:12] Doctrine out on the Seas of time but
[1:14:15] I'll give an anchor set in your life
[1:14:18] and that's what we wanted to just get to
[1:14:20] this morning is about being able to have
[1:14:23] God deal with our hearts and I'd like to
[1:14:26] read a few statements and
[1:14:29] I thought I found this true if Keith and
[1:14:34] this is in this same message that we're
[1:14:36] talking about on paragraph five he said
[1:14:39] today we find our places churches
[1:14:43] organizations and so forth begin to
[1:14:47] weaken again
[1:14:49] after this great Revival that had just
[1:14:52] swept the land
[1:14:54] we find out that that they add a little
[1:14:58] here
[1:14:59] or break down a little here or something
[1:15:04] over here that just can't work it never
[1:15:08] will work God would not let it work at
[1:15:12] first
[1:15:15] till we find out things are starting to
[1:15:17] weaken how many know is that
[1:15:20] okay I mean people aren't
[1:15:25] more Americans don't go to church now
[1:15:31] he used to 68 75 of America went to
[1:15:37] church
[1:15:38] now it's below 50 percent it's weakened
[1:15:43] the the power of God is weakened the
[1:15:46] spirit of God is weak and the the the
[1:15:50] it's just he tells us and he's warning
[1:15:54] us it's it's weakened we're living in a
[1:15:57] weakened Society
[1:15:59] you'll hear some more great statements
[1:16:01] that he makes he says
[1:16:04] and he says the reason for that is is
[1:16:07] the Revival is over
[1:16:10] so there was a time that there was a
[1:16:13] great a great
[1:16:16] outpouring of the spirit
[1:16:19] God was moving convicting people dealing
[1:16:22] the spirit of God was moving people were
[1:16:25] giving their hearts to the Lord
[1:16:27] there was a great move of of the spirit
[1:16:31] of God moving on America and it was
[1:16:34] given our country its last call
[1:16:37] but that's died down
[1:16:40] it's gone away and he makes this
[1:16:42] statement he says of course according to
[1:16:45] history
[1:16:46] Revival only lasts about three years
[1:16:50] and then revivalists
[1:16:53] lasted about that long then they live on
[1:16:58] the reputation of what they was in those
[1:17:02] three years
[1:17:06] that's something isn't it
[1:17:09] you know they they have three great
[1:17:12] years maybe of ministry and now they
[1:17:15] just live back off of the reputation of
[1:17:17] what they was I don't want to live on
[1:17:20] what I was I want to live for what I can
[1:17:23] be
[1:17:26] he says now he says
[1:17:29] he says
[1:17:32] he says of course
[1:17:34] he says now we find the Revival the
[1:17:39] interest of the people has fallen all
[1:17:42] together away
[1:17:44] now a 20-minute sermon is is a long time
[1:17:48] 15 years ago you could stay all night
[1:17:52] long and all day and all night and just
[1:17:57] keep on I stayed eight days and eight
[1:18:00] nights without leaving the platform and
[1:18:03] there was five times as many there as
[1:18:07] there was when we it started but now
[1:18:11] just a little while tired see the people
[1:18:15] can't help it that's the Revival's over
[1:18:21] so uh it's it's like it's like uh if I
[1:18:26] could say that pointing out this is what
[1:18:29] that you're up against
[1:18:33] you are now up against the fact that
[1:18:37] you're living in a fallen away Society
[1:18:40] people aren't interested in God 20
[1:18:44] minutes sermon is is too long the people
[1:18:47] are just tired I'm tired I'm hot there's
[1:18:51] nothing there to uh to uh create that
[1:18:57] that zeal
[1:19:03] so it behooves us
[1:19:06] that we recognize the effect of the
[1:19:11] atmosphere around us
[1:19:15] and and the day that we live in
[1:19:19] what it is that our enemy is that this
[1:19:23] spiritual Amnesia that the world's
[1:19:26] trying to put on us the the pressure
[1:19:29] that they're trying to put on us the
[1:19:32] difficulty to being a Christian that
[1:19:34] they're trying to put on us
[1:19:38] and we we we we we got if we see it and
[1:19:44] we recognize it then we got to realize
[1:19:46] we we got to stand up against what's
[1:19:49] trying to defeat us
[1:19:55] it is no good standing at the front door
[1:19:58] with the shotgun and leaving your back
[1:20:00] door unlocked
[1:20:05] you know you got to fight your enemy
[1:20:07] where your enemy's at
[1:20:11] and he's very deceptive
[1:20:16] and then I just wanted to read this
[1:20:17] because it's we serve a great God he
[1:20:21] said
[1:20:22] this is in paragraph 14 I believe he
[1:20:26] says now it's a little different here
[1:20:28] because you find here the people's
[1:20:32] becomes more or less uh
[1:20:38] chance uh taking
[1:20:41] gospel hardened
[1:20:44] but here
[1:20:46] you can teach you you can't teach them
[1:20:50] intellectual religion
[1:20:53] now this is what he's saying you can't
[1:20:55] teach them intellectual religion because
[1:20:58] they won't receive it
[1:21:01] you pass them tracks
[1:21:03] or go in and start talking about Christ
[1:21:07] or things like that
[1:21:09] they'll walk away and leave you standing
[1:21:13] there see
[1:21:15] they won't listen to you mohammons or or
[1:21:19] none of them because they have an
[1:21:22] intellectual religion
[1:21:26] I've got to see something positive
[1:21:31] something in action
[1:21:33] see it with their own eyes stand there
[1:21:37] and look at it see it spoken of the word
[1:21:42] and then come to pass that's what they
[1:21:47] look for
[1:21:49] once like that and then it's all over
[1:21:53] they're really believe it then
[1:21:56] in other words people aren't going to
[1:21:58] accept it intellectually anymore
[1:22:01] look your spirit
[1:22:05] and the the the
[1:22:10] Inner Man In You
[1:22:12] the seed in you is no longer going to
[1:22:16] accept an intellectual religion
[1:22:21] you yourselves have to reject the
[1:22:24] intellectual
[1:22:28] you start rejecting yourself you start
[1:22:31] rejecting your own religion you start
[1:22:33] rejecting your own intellect you so I
[1:22:36] said I don't want this kind of religion
[1:22:38] I just don't want to be taught I just
[1:22:41] don't want to hear them say brother Bram
[1:22:43] said this brother REM said that again I
[1:22:45] don't want it to be intellectual to me
[1:22:47] there's a deep inside the believer
[1:22:50] that's calling for a reality
[1:22:57] now look at what he said the Revival's
[1:23:00] over
[1:23:02] harder to be a Christian than ever
[1:23:07] you're meeting more resistance
[1:23:10] nobody wants intellectual
[1:23:14] they want to see something
[1:23:18] well
[1:23:19] do you realize that that real hunger
[1:23:24] is in you
[1:23:28] it's been a long Cry Of My Heart Lord I
[1:23:31] just don't want someone to come up here
[1:23:33] and pray for me lay hands on them pray a
[1:23:37] prayer for him and then say to them you
[1:23:39] go away according you know you go
[1:23:42] believe it for yourself
[1:23:45] what part did I play in them
[1:23:48] I just did a little religious ceremony
[1:23:51] but I want to be able for my faith to
[1:23:54] connect with their faith until something
[1:23:57] happens
[1:24:01] and that's what the people are looking
[1:24:04] for something that they can see that
[1:24:07] said see that spoken and see it come to
[1:24:11] pass
[1:24:13] see we're only on the say side
[1:24:17] and the speak side we need to get over
[1:24:20] to where we have the faith for the come
[1:24:22] to pass sign
[1:24:25] and he says this he goes on
[1:24:29] he said
[1:24:31] he says they'll really believe it then
[1:24:35] so God is just as much God tonight as he
[1:24:39] ever was
[1:24:41] in other words unbelief doesn't stop God
[1:24:46] this cold formal religion this doesn't
[1:24:49] stop God God still is real still is
[1:24:53] powerful can still do for you
[1:24:55] exceedingly abundantly above what you
[1:24:57] can think or ask he's still Divine he's
[1:25:00] still Supernatural
[1:25:03] that hasn't changed
[1:25:05] so what's changed
[1:25:08] the environment
[1:25:10] around the believer
[1:25:13] the believer is losing
[1:25:17] their understanding and their ability to
[1:25:21] communicate with God
[1:25:24] amen yeah and I'm talking Beyond just
[1:25:28] sitting down and reading your Bible
[1:25:31] and feeling of inspiration I'm talking
[1:25:34] about how are the footsteps of the
[1:25:37] righteous LED of the Lord every day
[1:25:43] how does he deal with you how does he
[1:25:45] communicate with you how do you know
[1:25:48] it's him how how does he talk to you and
[1:25:52] so he's he's as the Everest that's true
[1:25:56] we believe him like that we believe he
[1:25:59] heals the sick he saves the Lost he
[1:26:02] fills with the Holy Ghost those who have
[1:26:05] hunger hearts and waiting for
[1:26:09] him
[1:26:10] amen is that your great heart's desire
[1:26:14] he says
[1:26:16] may we purpose in our hearts tonight
[1:26:19] to be quiet before the Lord
[1:26:22] wait upon him
[1:26:25] wait Moment by moment
[1:26:27] expecting the right word to be said
[1:26:32] or the right thing to be done
[1:26:36] that would give us the appropriate faith
[1:26:41] that would Dash right in to the
[1:26:44] blessings of God
[1:26:48] that's quite a statement
[1:26:50] that would that we would we would
[1:26:53] purpose in our hearts to be quiet before
[1:26:56] the Lord
[1:26:58] until the right thing is said
[1:27:01] the right thing is done
[1:27:04] that appropriates the faith in us
[1:27:09] that we can Dash into the blessing of
[1:27:13] God that we can catch a glimpse of the
[1:27:16] blessing of God and run into it
[1:27:20] it's hard to come into church
[1:27:24] and quiet your spirit
[1:27:29] it's it's quiet and hard to sit there
[1:27:34] waiting for the right thing to be said
[1:27:37] the right thing to be done everything
[1:27:39] becomes common we don't think God speaks
[1:27:42] we don't think God deals with us we
[1:27:45] don't think he knows what we're going
[1:27:47] through we we almost get to the point
[1:27:50] that we think that he's far away and
[1:27:53] he's not mindful of us but he is mindful
[1:27:56] of you he's the same yesterday today and
[1:27:59] forever he hasn't changed he's still
[1:28:02] Supernatural do you believe that
[1:28:05] and so we we recognize that he says now
[1:28:11] let us be real sincere
[1:28:13] and hopeful now
[1:28:16] that what we have asked
[1:28:19] for
[1:28:22] it would be wrong to ask for something
[1:28:25] and then disbelieve it this paragraph 24
[1:28:29] in the book that I'm using
[1:28:32] he says disbelieving see we don't we
[1:28:37] don't get enough sincerity
[1:28:40] with our worship
[1:28:45] you know can I throw another word in
[1:28:47] here we don't just focus on the worship
[1:28:54] if we don't focus on the words we don't
[1:28:56] focus on the present it comes time to
[1:28:59] worship we like the ham we like the
[1:29:02] melody uh you know I love it but when
[1:29:05] you begin to Worship You focus on him
[1:29:08] you draw his face in you to look upon
[1:29:11] his faith you're sincere you recognize
[1:29:14] his presence
[1:29:16] your whole attitude you're you're the
[1:29:20] atmosphere you're creating okay it's not
[1:29:24] for granted you you get sincere about it
[1:29:28] I mean you're singing praises to the
[1:29:31] Lord
[1:29:33] you know your kids don't want you know
[1:29:35] someone to
[1:29:37] I mean you ever talk to somebody and
[1:29:41] they're talked into yeah and talking on
[1:29:43] the phone they're not sincere about that
[1:29:46] conversation they're not sincere about
[1:29:48] what you have to say there's no
[1:29:50] anticipation could you hear what he said
[1:29:53] he said let's re real sincere and
[1:29:56] hopeful now
[1:29:58] that the things that we ask for we're
[1:30:01] going to receive
[1:30:04] now if I say this because he just told
[1:30:07] us that everything's falling away is
[1:30:10] starting to die out it's starting to get
[1:30:13] dim
[1:30:15] look if you're sitting in the drought
[1:30:17] then you've got to realize I better give
[1:30:20] some spiritual water
[1:30:24] I better get sincere about my soul
[1:30:31] how sincere would you get if the Lord
[1:30:35] came down here not me but he actually
[1:30:38] appeared here this morning Atkins stood
[1:30:41] here visible before your eyes and said
[1:30:44] only eight souls in here are going
[1:30:53] have any of you considered you might go
[1:30:56] to hell
[1:31:00] well I don't believe you're going to go
[1:31:02] to hell but I want to certainly make
[1:31:04] sure I'm not
[1:31:08] I don't want to chance it
[1:31:13] I don't want to walk on the guard rail
[1:31:15] on the edge of a cliff saying I hope I
[1:31:18] don't fall off I hope I don't fall off
[1:31:21] you know what I mean I hope a wind don't
[1:31:23] come I hope the rail don't break
[1:31:26] no we don't stay on the edge we move
[1:31:30] right as far close to the mountain as we
[1:31:33] can be
[1:31:35] that isn't no skill
[1:31:37] it ain't no skill to see how close to
[1:31:40] the world you can be and how you can
[1:31:42] come into church
[1:31:44] forget that
[1:31:47] make full account of your salvation make
[1:31:51] your election and calling sure that's
[1:31:54] the scripture make your election and
[1:31:57] calling sure apply the token get every
[1:32:00] questionable thing out of the way let's
[1:32:03] make the last mile of this road
[1:32:08] don't don't there's no need Faking It
[1:32:11] you're not faking me out
[1:32:16] I can't tell if you're a Christian or
[1:32:18] not
[1:32:22] I mean I could judge the way you dress
[1:32:24] you know and I might be able to measure
[1:32:28] what I think you know or don't know
[1:32:33] but other than that I can't tell
[1:32:37] you know who does know though
[1:32:39] you know
[1:32:42] you know if the Lord appeared today
[1:32:46] you know whether you've been back in the
[1:32:48] shed smoking dope or you've been out
[1:32:50] doing this or doing that
[1:32:55] you know that
[1:32:57] nobody else knows
[1:33:00] nobody else needs to know
[1:33:02] but there's one that does know
[1:33:07] he knows
[1:33:10] so it might be smart for us to say hey
[1:33:13] he knows I know he knows maybe me and
[1:33:16] him ought to get on the same page
[1:33:20] try to get things right right he said
[1:33:26] he said we must be deeply sincere
[1:33:30] I wonder can you hear
[1:33:33] all right he talks about hearing all
[1:33:35] writing about and he says now just be
[1:33:37] yourself
[1:33:39] simple humble waiting for the coming of
[1:33:42] the Lord
[1:33:43] now we don't believe in glamor
[1:33:46] something Shining
[1:33:49] you know I always said Hollywood shines
[1:33:51] but Christianity glows
[1:33:54] there's a lot of difference between
[1:33:57] shining and glowing Hollywood shines
[1:34:00] with plate class Society oh glamor but
[1:34:04] the Christian glows with humility
[1:34:08] the way
[1:34:09] up is always down
[1:34:14] now I trust that everyone will be filled
[1:34:18] with the Holy Spirit
[1:34:19] and now before you can be filled with
[1:34:23] the Holy Spirit you've got to die to
[1:34:26] yourself first in order to be born again
[1:34:32] amen and with that comment there
[1:34:36] I would like to go over and
[1:34:40] and uh
[1:34:43] pick up where I would like to
[1:34:46] uh I take the prophet of God goes for a
[1:34:50] little section where he explains what
[1:34:52] James John and every things talked about
[1:34:55] you can get the message and read it but
[1:34:58] I want to listen for about 21 minutes
[1:35:00] this morning and then I'll close with a
[1:35:02] few comments
[1:35:03] together
[1:35:05] okay Peter and them on the
[1:35:08] Mountain
[1:35:11] and all of the symbols and types that
[1:35:14] are lying there the deity and the Lord
[1:35:17] says
[1:35:18] hear ye
[1:35:20] him
[1:35:22] so that's what
[1:35:25] emphasizing this morning hear ye him
[1:35:30] when he speaks do you hear
[1:35:34] what what does he use
[1:35:38] to reach you and to touch you
[1:35:41] and so in this 21 minutes he he
[1:35:46] he might not say that exactly the way
[1:35:50] that I'm saying it but listen and to see
[1:35:54] what it is
[1:35:56] that the spirit's doing
[1:35:58] as our Messengers preaching to this
[1:36:01] people
[1:36:03] how is he trying to reach him
[1:36:06] how what's he trying to get to him
[1:36:09] what's he trying to create in their
[1:36:12] heart what's he trying to bring to their
[1:36:15] mind well to what what is he trying to
[1:36:18] get him to focus on
[1:36:20] and maybe through listening to this it
[1:36:24] it'll be a a great uh a blessing to you
[1:36:30] and would just go forward uh from there
[1:36:34] because I think it's our uh
[1:36:38] our great understanding and may I say
[1:36:41] this before we listen to this part I'd
[1:36:44] like to hear this is what the messenger
[1:36:46] says remember the Bible said
[1:36:49] the Holy Ghost only sealed those
[1:36:54] who sigh and cry for the Abomination
[1:36:59] that was did in the city
[1:37:03] I'd like to take your Pastor out
[1:37:07] take the other pastors here
[1:37:10] how many
[1:37:12] members
[1:37:13] of your church that's laid on their face
[1:37:17] and cried nightly daily for the
[1:37:23] Abomination done in the city
[1:37:26] there see the Zeals all
[1:37:31] gone
[1:37:33] I hope we can fire up our Zeal this
[1:37:36] morning would you listen with me this
[1:37:38] morning to 21 minutes of our messenger
[1:37:41] listen and see if if he could speak to
[1:37:47] your heart okay so I I think it's uh
[1:37:51] I don't know what paragraph they have
[1:37:53] but this is from the message I guess you
[1:37:57] could have a device uh it's it's 40 a
[1:38:00] paragraph 47 I have I don't know what it
[1:38:04] is in some other form but I think I got
[1:38:07] mine from the table
[1:38:09] so uh paragraph 47 listen to what our
[1:38:13] messenger has to say and I believe it's
[1:38:16] for us this morning don't you amen Lord
[1:38:19] bless you just 21 minutes thank you
[1:38:22] foreign
[1:38:26] Peter called it the Holy Mountain
[1:38:27] because the holy God had been on this
[1:38:31] mountain
[1:38:32] and before God does anything
[1:38:35] usually on the earth he usually speaks
[1:38:38] of It Out of Heaven first did you ever
[1:38:41] notice that
[1:38:42] he always speaks from Heaven first the
[1:38:45] supernatural always manifest itself
[1:38:49] and then comes down and to the people
[1:38:53] if you notice before Israel was called
[1:38:56] out of Egypt Moses had tried to do that
[1:39:00] believing that he was the
[1:39:06] outfit
[1:39:08] yeah that's where we're finishing
[1:39:12] yeah paragraph 47 I'm sorry
[1:39:24] uh no it's uh now uh now in the Old
[1:39:29] Testament we find in the books of the
[1:39:33] New Testament also in Galatians
[1:39:36] just
[1:39:39] okay that uh yeah ours don't match up
[1:39:43] um
[1:39:44] do you find it there yeah
[1:39:47] all right
[1:39:52] yes thank you all right great
[1:39:57] okay now in the Old Testament we find in
[1:40:00] the books of the New Testament also in
[1:40:02] Galatians and so how Paul explaining it
[1:40:04] he was placing a son
[1:40:08] like in the Old Testament now when a
[1:40:11] father had a a great a kingdom you
[1:40:13] notice and uh over here also in the
[1:40:17] Bible it says Matthew the uh 24th
[1:40:20] chapter I believe it is or no Saint John
[1:40:23] the 14th chapter I'll take that one
[1:40:24] another English interpretation of it
[1:40:27] says in My Father's House
[1:40:30] is many mansions doesn't that sound kind
[1:40:33] of strange to us today in My Father's
[1:40:36] House
[1:40:37] is many mansions mansions in a little
[1:40:40] house many mentions in a house ICF
[1:40:43] another uh and the translators that
[1:40:46] translated that for the king see in that
[1:40:49] day a kingdom was called a house and the
[1:40:53] father was a king over the house in my
[1:40:56] father's kingdom is many mentions as the
[1:41:00] right way the a Hebrew way of
[1:41:02] interpreting our moffatt made it worse
[1:41:04] than ever in my father's apartment
[1:41:05] houses many apartments like we were
[1:41:07] going up there to that shows what a
[1:41:09] carnal mind can do with the word of God
[1:41:11] that's right our studio not long ago in
[1:41:14] Athens Greece and seen the picture
[1:41:15] painted of what they call Adam Eve that
[1:41:18] Eve was the most hideous looking thing I
[1:41:20] ever seen in my life and Adam looked
[1:41:21] like some prehistoric giant why it goes
[1:41:24] to show that what the carnal conception
[1:41:26] of what God's creation is it takes the
[1:41:29] spirit of God to reveal pain and God's
[1:41:33] word is revealed only by his Spirit
[1:41:35] rides hid from the eyes of wise and
[1:41:38] reveal to bathe such as we'll learn your
[1:41:41] God was standing there now he was doing
[1:41:43] exactly what he asked them to do now in
[1:41:47] a father's great heritage where he had
[1:41:49] he had many Hard Men working for him now
[1:41:53] this is a little teaching here I hope it
[1:41:55] don't hurt but I just won't make a point
[1:41:57] your face started right that when we get
[1:41:59] started we'll be on the right foot
[1:42:01] notice now when a baby son was born into
[1:42:06] this family all of this father he was
[1:42:10] born a son
[1:42:13] but yet he had no inheritance
[1:42:15] just as a son
[1:42:17] now there's where I think that we Full
[1:42:20] Gospel people let down a little bit on
[1:42:23] our Doctrine see we take a person say
[1:42:25] well nice deal with the Holy Ghost he
[1:42:27] speaks with tongues that's it no you
[1:42:30] just only began yeah
[1:42:31] yeah you've just been born into the
[1:42:33] family
[1:42:34] that's all that's the reason today that
[1:42:36] we are churches is not progressing the
[1:42:39] way they should be I think after this
[1:42:41] great revivalists swept the world in
[1:42:43] these last few years I think the saints
[1:42:45] of God ought to be in the heavenlies
[1:42:47] everywhere and the power of God going
[1:42:50] into hospitals and everywhere else and
[1:42:52] great signs and wonders and miracles
[1:42:54] taking place but he can't get the people
[1:42:56] stand still long enough
[1:42:59] if we sow denominational seeds we reap a
[1:43:01] denominational Harvest
[1:43:03] exactly that's what we've done if you
[1:43:06] notice that word there in the Hebrew
[1:43:08] former and lattering farmering means a
[1:43:12] sowing ring and then when the spirit
[1:43:14] Falls it falls on the just and unjust if
[1:43:16] we sold denominational seeds we just
[1:43:19] reap the denominational Harvest that's
[1:43:21] what we've done the Baptist took a
[1:43:23] million more and 44. hard to tell what
[1:43:25] they are nice the great advantages Billy
[1:43:27] Graham and many of them are swept look
[1:43:28] at our Pentecostals through oral
[1:43:30] Robertson Tommy Osborne and great man
[1:43:32] like that well what have we done we've
[1:43:33] had members got better churches bigger
[1:43:36] membership what we need is quality not
[1:43:39] quantity
[1:43:42] that's the hunting of the Bride today
[1:43:44] Ella easer had an awful time finding
[1:43:47] finding quality
[1:43:50] and then to get her ready to go was the
[1:43:52] next thing after he found him so that's
[1:43:54] that's the next thing to do we're
[1:43:56] hunting for that now the Holy Spirit
[1:43:58] God's servant as Eliza was his hunting
[1:44:01] for that quality that genuineness that's
[1:44:05] something that won't take back on God's
[1:44:07] word will stay in our liver down
[1:44:14] a weak service down here at Grass Valley
[1:44:16] on Abraham only seed and so forth how
[1:44:19] did that genuine Royal seat of Abraham
[1:44:22] holds that word regardless of how
[1:44:24] ridiculous it sounds or anything else he
[1:44:26] stays right with it because he's the
[1:44:28] Seed of Abraham right
[1:44:30] now notice in the Old Testament now this
[1:44:33] boy when he was born into a family now
[1:44:36] the first thing the father did after he
[1:44:38] got old enough to begin to be tough
[1:44:40] is his son when he's born certainly he's
[1:44:43] the family name he's got it but he has
[1:44:46] no inheritance yet you have to find out
[1:44:48] what kind of a person that's going to be
[1:44:49] before he has an inheritance now the
[1:44:52] father to be sure that that son had the
[1:44:55] right training hunted the very best
[1:44:58] tutor that he could find
[1:45:00] and he never got one that would just
[1:45:01] pull punches to find favor or something
[1:45:04] like that say well I'll make a report on
[1:45:06] the boy he's doing all right because the
[1:45:08] father might lift me up a little he's
[1:45:10] going to get somebody's going to tell
[1:45:11] him the truth
[1:45:13] and he and now if the boy did real well
[1:45:17] how the the tutor liked to walk up to
[1:45:19] the father with a good honest faith and
[1:45:22] faith and say yes sir your son is doing
[1:45:24] fine but I would be shameful if you'd
[1:45:27] walk up there and tell her his boy is a
[1:45:30] renegade how he had hate to do that now
[1:45:33] I wonder today that when God has called
[1:45:35] his Pentecostal church about 50 years
[1:45:37] ago
[1:45:39] I wonder if and when he called the
[1:45:41] church at the beginning what kind of a
[1:45:44] tutor did he put over the church yeah
[1:45:46] he sent the Holy Spirit to be the tutor
[1:45:49] and today we've twisted around with
[1:45:52] Bishops and Cardinals and popes and
[1:45:54] everything else with all kinds of
[1:45:56] ecclesiastical ideas and dogmas it's
[1:45:59] added and tuck away from that Bible to
[1:46:00] other people don't know what to believe
[1:46:02] amen
[1:46:03] right amen they don't know which way to
[1:46:06] turn yes the poor people like a bunch of
[1:46:08] sheep having a snow Shepherd a bunch of
[1:46:10] geese without a leader that's right they
[1:46:13] don't know which way to fly everything
[1:46:14] it's just gone every way this says this
[1:46:16] way I'm listening this way and well they
[1:46:18] don't know what to believe but God sent
[1:46:21] to his church the holy spirit amen
[1:46:23] that's the tutor and that tutor will
[1:46:25] tell the truth before God
[1:46:28] amen he he teaches the children the word
[1:46:32] in the beginning was a word and the word
[1:46:34] is with God and the Word was God
[1:46:37] will judge the church as I said a while
[1:46:39] ago by his word the Bible said I felt
[1:46:41] that come to me the Bible said in your
[1:46:43] the God would judge his church by Jesus
[1:46:46] Christ that's right and Jesus is the
[1:46:48] word amen
[1:46:50] so it's a word made manifest if Christ
[1:46:53] Still Remains Christ he takes that word
[1:46:56] and manifests
[1:46:58] amen
[1:47:00] there you are it's a word living among
[1:47:03] us coming to life
[1:47:05] now
[1:47:07] this tutor what if that boy was awful he
[1:47:11] wasn't about the father's business
[1:47:13] you just do anything how that tutor
[1:47:16] would be a shame to walk up before the
[1:47:18] father and say
[1:47:20] sir I I hate to tell you but your boy is
[1:47:23] just not doing very well I imagine it
[1:47:26] blush
[1:47:27] turn his face away
[1:47:29] what do you think the Holy Spirit does
[1:47:31] today when he comes up before God our
[1:47:33] Father with the report from the church
[1:47:36] that we broke up in 900 different
[1:47:38] organizations won't have Fellowship one
[1:47:40] with another
[1:47:41] and everybody got this that and the
[1:47:43] other nobody just want to make more
[1:47:45] members bringing in more this and that
[1:47:47] I imagine he turns his head
[1:47:50] I could say something right Bernie here
[1:47:51] it might hurt but you know this is the
[1:47:53] House of Correction
[1:47:55] you believe it
[1:47:57] I'm glad you said that I mean Sylvia
[1:47:59] what are you thinking God would do today
[1:48:02] when the Holy Spirit comes and tells him
[1:48:03] it in our churches that we've accepted
[1:48:06] dogma's instead of his word
[1:48:08] what do you think we accept Creeds
[1:48:10] instead of Christ
[1:48:12] what do you think he does when our when
[1:48:14] he comes up and says that his daughters
[1:48:15] is all bobbed off their hair
[1:48:18] wearing sharks
[1:48:20] smoking cigarettes
[1:48:23] that's the Bible said such can't enter
[1:48:27] the misfleet you said don't make any
[1:48:28] difference don't you let the devil tell
[1:48:30] you that
[1:48:32] if God said so Paul said in your
[1:48:34] Galatians 1 8 if an angel from heaven
[1:48:36] preaches any other gospel in this life
[1:48:38] preach let him be a curse
[1:48:40] why did it make
[1:48:43] it makes it over his shoulder and turn
[1:48:45] to a pillar of salt
[1:48:47] you've got to take the word amen there's
[1:48:50] a lion somewhere
[1:48:52] we've got to get back to the gospel back
[1:48:54] to Christ back to the Living Word not
[1:48:57] bypass it for some something this way
[1:48:59] you've got to believe it well if you're
[1:49:01] going to say they don't believe in
[1:49:02] healing anymore your stripes wasn't vain
[1:49:04] to them because they say days of
[1:49:05] Miracles has passed
[1:49:07] oh he must have to blush when he says
[1:49:09] that before the father Yes see they
[1:49:12] don't they don't believe it they're
[1:49:13] getting away from it day by day falling
[1:49:16] farther and further away you know that
[1:49:18] you don't have to think about some of
[1:49:20] you old people have been in this longer
[1:49:22] than I have looked back a few years ago
[1:49:24] what it was all night prayer meetings

[1:49:29] Wednesday night maybe by six o'clock or
[1:49:31] seven o'clock maybe don't even come to

[1:49:34] filthy television thing of some woman
[1:49:36] married four or five times to some man
[1:49:38] or man married four or five times then
[1:49:40] say you love God
[1:49:42] staying away from prayer meetings
[1:49:47] watch we love Susie or Elvis Presley or
[1:49:50] some of them guys that sold their
[1:49:51] birthrights
[1:49:52] for a mess of Elvis Presley was a
[1:49:54] Pentecostal boy
[1:49:56] sent more souls to hell and Judas ever
[1:49:58] would sure cause taking these young
[1:50:00] girls and they say well he's very
[1:50:02] religious don't you believe such a thing
[1:50:04] as that
[1:50:06] religious Satan is too it's always Cain
[1:50:10] don't you believe that it's just the
[1:50:12] devil's worst to get you kids out there
[1:50:14] on them floors all this blogly Wiggly
[1:50:16] and all that nonsense twisting all kinds
[1:50:20] of stuff out there vulgar living half
[1:50:22] dress
[1:50:24] some of Youth Pentecostal women's
[1:50:26] ashamed that's right you man will let
[1:50:29] them do it you're worse than they are
[1:50:30] but doing it right a man supposed to be
[1:50:33] the room of his own house
[1:50:36] and what do we got today no wonder we
[1:50:38] can't have faith no one that can't be a
[1:50:39] healing services in America we got away
[1:50:41] from God Amen
[1:50:44] not long ago I stood there in South
[1:50:46] Africa at a meeting one day and seen as
[1:50:49] many as 10 000 native women didn't know
[1:50:52] right left hand naked is to come in this
[1:50:54] world and receive Christ as personal
[1:50:56] Savior and while they were standing
[1:50:58] there with their hands up and receiving
[1:50:59] when they dropped their hands they
[1:51:01] folded their hands to walk away
[1:51:03] covering up as much of them as he could
[1:51:05] Holy Ghost himself making them know they
[1:51:07] were naked how can you say that but
[1:51:09] blanket native who knows nothing about
[1:51:11] God received the Holy Ghost and realize
[1:51:13] they're naked and these American women
[1:51:15] stripping every year came to be singing
[1:51:17] in choirs and Christians supposed to be
[1:51:19] there's something wrong somewhere and it
[1:51:22] ain't the god of his Bible amen
[1:51:26] and you know as you know Wonder we can't
[1:51:28] have revivals or we can't pass into this
[1:51:30] no wonder that things can't happen
[1:51:34] the Tudors coming before the father
[1:51:36] shaking his hand oh my that's terrible
[1:51:39] the way they're doing well that's true
[1:51:41] what's the matter some little ticket
[1:51:43] meal ticket or something or a little
[1:51:46] something if somebody's afraid to say
[1:51:47] something that's God's word
[1:51:50] reach it or leave it alone now strange
[1:51:54] thing some lady said to me not long ago
[1:51:55] I made a remark after coming back she's
[1:51:58] had a lot of manicure on you know the
[1:52:00] you know the brothers called it the I
[1:52:02] seen one the other day honestly I felt
[1:52:04] this I was Eclipse as a businessman's
[1:52:06] breakfast and I was standing out there
[1:52:07] waiting for Brother to argue about to
[1:52:08] come up and one of these women come up
[1:52:10] these water head haircuts and one of the
[1:52:11] great big things like that I never seen
[1:52:13] such a outfit in my life that that might
[1:52:15] have been a nice looking woman but she
[1:52:17] looked like a prehistoric animal because
[1:52:19] she was standing there I I ain't saying
[1:52:21] that for a joke that's this is no place
[1:52:22] for joking this is the Bible this is
[1:52:24] God's Trina and there she stood there
[1:52:26] with with blue over her eyes and and
[1:52:28] read over the top of that and oh I I
[1:52:30] said I'm a I see plegri I've seen
[1:52:33] leprosy but I never seen anything like
[1:52:35] that I thought the woman I thought the
[1:52:37] woman was sick and I walked over two
[1:52:39] years ago to ask her I tell her I say
[1:52:41] sister uh pardon me but I'm a missionary
[1:52:43] I pray for the sick could I help you and
[1:52:45] just about time my hair come two three
[1:52:47] more women up the same way and I thought
[1:52:48] you don't mean to tell me these American
[1:52:50] Americans are acting like that I could
[1:52:52] see the natives out there do that that's
[1:52:54] a heathen Drake I can see them put mud
[1:52:56] in their face and things make color but
[1:52:58] nothing enough what civilized people is
[1:53:00] supposed to be you talk about
[1:53:01] civilization we're the whole Pinnacle
[1:53:03] swung backwards it's exactly right amen
[1:53:06] all such a disgrace I said something
[1:53:08] about it one time the lady met me
[1:53:10] outside she said Mr random I'll give you
[1:53:12] to understand I'm Pentecostal I said
[1:53:14] well praise the Lord and act like it
[1:53:18] she said
[1:53:20] well she said do you think it's wrong
[1:53:22] and for a woman you said about a woman
[1:53:24] putting on a man's garment I said the
[1:53:25] Bible said she said I don't wear shorts
[1:53:28] she said I'll wear slacks I said that's
[1:53:30] worse
[1:53:31] the Bible says some Abomination for a
[1:53:33] woman to put on a garment pertains to a
[1:53:34] man
[1:53:35] right God is infinite God can never
[1:53:39] change amen his decision is perfect show
[1:53:42] me one time God changes
[1:53:44] he doesn't he made the recommendation of
[1:53:47] the Garden of Eden that's the only place
[1:53:49] to worship God was
[1:53:52] God but it's always the only glorifies
[1:53:54] you've heard him say that the whole time
[1:53:56] I shall not killed but I say to you
[1:53:58] whosoever is angry with his brother you
[1:54:00] hear him say thy son I commit adultery
[1:54:01] but I say unto you whosoever looketh
[1:54:04] upon a woman to lust after her listen
[1:54:06] here and she said well I'll tell you now
[1:54:08] she said um uh they don't make clothes
[1:54:10] like uh like that I said they still make
[1:54:12] sewing machines and sell Goods there's
[1:54:14] no no excuses either you're just gonna
[1:54:16] be left without an excuse listen let me
[1:54:18] ask you to say this one thing and we'll
[1:54:19] leave the subject because that's for
[1:54:20] your pastors but I just this that you
[1:54:23] know what I think about it now look
[1:54:26] when you come to the Judgment ball
[1:54:28] did you know you can be condemned right
[1:54:31] there for committing adultery yet be
[1:54:32] just as pure as a living
[1:54:35] Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[1:54:37] woman the lust after and some of you
[1:54:39] women let your girls go out there and
[1:54:41] and put on them pose and walk out there
[1:54:43] now walk that sinner comes down the
[1:54:44] street and looks up on that woman lustly
[1:54:46] he's going to have to answer for it at
[1:54:48] the day of judgment for committing
[1:54:49] adultery who did it
[1:54:51] who's guilty she was for presenting
[1:54:54] herself like that
[1:54:55] it's exactly right don't fall out with
[1:54:57] me talk god about it that's right but
[1:55:00] that's what the Holy Ghost comes up
[1:55:01] before the father said how could we ever
[1:55:03] build a church up on something like that
[1:55:05] amen how can listen France it's time to
[1:55:07] clean the from the top of the pulpit
[1:55:09] come to the janitor down there and start
[1:55:11] over it's just like a bunch of you take
[1:55:13] the birds lay their eggs in the
[1:55:15] springtime and the old mother bird can
[1:55:17] lay a nest the eggs and she not don't
[1:55:19] have to be with her mate but she can lay
[1:55:21] them eggs and she can hover them she can
[1:55:22] turn them and she can stay there until
[1:55:24] she Stars herself and she gets the poor
[1:55:26] she can't get off the nest and they'll
[1:55:27] never hatch
[1:55:28] while they're rotten they're rot right
[1:55:31] in the nest that's just what's the
[1:55:32] matter today we just took in so many
[1:55:34] members and so forth and bathing him
[1:55:37] here and babe in America just got a nest
[1:55:38] full of rock Mage it's time to clean the
[1:55:40] thing out and get them people with the
[1:55:42] make Christ Jesus with the word of God
[1:55:44] back in action
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:48] then you'll see Christ riding on the
[1:55:51] scene on the power he cannot come as
[1:55:53] long as these things are blocking him
[1:55:54] that's right no wonder the tutor come up
[1:55:57] before the father and bless us and say
[1:55:59] yeah your church yeah I know it says
[1:56:01] that but they don't do it you mean
[1:56:02] they're not they're not doing it
[1:56:04] there you are what a disgrace what a
[1:56:07] Pity that must be before the father when
[1:56:09] the tutor comes up the Holy Spirit and
[1:56:11] brings that cause he is our tutor we
[1:56:13] know that huh now this the and the Holy
[1:56:16] Spirit wrote the Bible the Bible said so
[1:56:18] man of old moved by the Holy Ghost wrote
[1:56:20] the Bible so the Bible is written by
[1:56:22] inspiration there's no private
[1:56:23] interpretation it's just the way it's
[1:56:24] wrote right there just take it and
[1:56:26] believe it act on it God will bring it
[1:56:28] to pass I've never seen him promise
[1:56:30] anything yet but what he done you'll
[1:56:32] always do it now
[1:56:33] here comes the here comes the tutor up
[1:56:36] now what if his he comes up before the
[1:56:38] father how he feels ma comes up and says
[1:56:41] oh your son is progressing he's just
[1:56:44] like a chip off the old block as we call
[1:56:46] it down the South he's just exactly like
[1:56:48] you he's just so interested in all the
[1:56:51] sick and The Afflicted he's so
[1:56:53] interested in the salvation of the
[1:56:54] people he's so interested in all this he
[1:56:56] believes every word you said you know
[1:56:58] what he's running a church just exactly
[1:57:01] like you'd run it if you were there
[1:57:04] you know the way your son run it when he
[1:57:05] was there yes that's the same way he's
[1:57:07] doing it and you know you had wrote in
[1:57:09] there he's the same yesterday today and
[1:57:11] forever yes well that's just exactly
[1:57:13] what they're doing oh my ah how the
[1:57:17] Folly must say that's my son
[1:57:19] that's my child
[1:57:21] that's the reason he could smile here
[1:57:24] Jesus had carried out every word of them
[1:57:28] that's it you carried out just exactly
[1:57:31] to the word
[1:57:32] now because he was that perfect son and
[1:57:36] he is the same and he died to become the
[1:57:39] vine that we might become the branch
[1:57:40] that he could energize us with his life
[1:57:43] to make the same life that he had living
[1:57:45] in US
[1:57:46] they would do the same thing Jesus said
[1:57:49] in Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on
[1:57:51] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:57:53] amen
[1:57:54] now we watch what he done
[1:57:56] see we're having time tonight but we'll
[1:57:58] take it up later and see what his Works
[1:58:00] was maybe tomorrow night then see if
[1:58:02] he'll perform that same works if he does
[1:58:04] he Remains the Same now then God will be
[1:58:08] pleased with that but when we go around
[1:58:10] saying well I tell you we belong to the
[1:58:12] so-and-so and I I asked the woman at one
[1:58:15] time on a prayer line I said are you a
[1:58:17] Christian she said I'll give you to
[1:58:19] understand she said I burn a candle
[1:58:21] every night like that had anything to do
[1:58:23] with Christianity burning a cantile
[1:58:25] every night I said well that no more
[1:58:27] than slopping Hogs every night see I
[1:58:28] said that wouldn't be a bit more to me I
[1:58:31] said are you born again
[1:58:33] you know Christ as your savior has it
[1:58:35] become a real reality
[1:58:37] are you living in Christ is Christ
[1:58:40] Living in you that day you Lord I am in
[1:58:43] the Father the father me you and I and
[1:58:45] you that's it God living among these
[1:58:47] people that's the way and we find out
[1:58:51] on this day now we take if that son had
[1:58:54] been a good son he was just exactly now
[1:58:56] remember he was a born son I don't miss
[1:58:59] this
[1:59:00] he was a born son but year after year he
[1:59:03] progressed
[1:59:04] he was constantly about the father's
[1:59:06] business
[1:59:07] you've done the work just exactly where
[1:59:09] the father did how the tutors said oh
[1:59:11] that's wonderful tell a father why it's
[1:59:13] just exactly where you'd run it if you
[1:59:14] were there he bawled out this he
[1:59:16] condemned this he give this a place he
[1:59:18] done this just exactly the way you do no
[1:59:21] different just exactly it's just like
[1:59:23] you there it's your life ain't even sure
[1:59:25] because you sure tell he's the son of
[1:59:27] God because he was born after you see he
[1:59:29] does the same thing stays right with
[1:59:30] your word never misses a word stays
[1:59:32] right into it punches it right on
[1:59:34] through oh the father must say that's
[1:59:36] wonderful and there come a day then if
[1:59:39] this son continued on there come a day
[1:59:42] that what they call the placing of a son
[1:59:46] then the father called a group of people
[1:59:48] together in the city he took his own son
[1:59:51] and dressed him in a lovely robe and set
[1:59:54] him up high so everybody could see had a
[1:59:58] ceremony and he adopted
[2:00:01] his own son that had been born into his
[2:00:04] home are placed him and when he did that
[2:00:07] son's name after that was just as good
[2:00:10] as the father's name on the chapter
[2:00:12] whatever his signature them days there
[2:00:14] was a seal of wrinkles many of them
[2:00:15] Couldn't Write there's a Penitentiary
[2:00:17] offense to ever to copy that seal they
[2:00:20] had on the back of the ring and they
[2:00:22] would and I said like that and he could
[2:00:24] wear his father's ring
[2:00:26] why his name is just as good as the
[2:00:29] fathers was now that's what God's trying
[2:00:31] to get his church to
[2:00:34] a place that where we are Sons and
[2:00:36] Daughters of God
[2:00:38] see but we're we're in trouble we're
[2:00:42] letting everything and now the the world
[2:00:44] trying to smother the real thing down is
[2:00:46] trying to make people scared of
[2:00:47] Communism don't you just be a spirit are
[2:00:50] the common isn't that's nothing
[2:00:55] amen
[2:00:57] amen let's just take a few quick remarks
[2:01:01] and then we'll close this morning
[2:01:04] that's the reason he could smile Jesus
[2:01:07] had carried out every word of it
[2:01:10] he carried out just exactly to the word
[2:01:13] now because he was the perfect son
[2:01:17] and he is the same and he died to become
[2:01:21] the vine that we might become the
[2:01:24] branches
[2:01:25] that he can energize us with his life
[2:01:31] to make the same life that he had live
[2:01:35] in US
[2:01:37] then we'll do the same thing
[2:01:48] see if I have this uh
[2:01:52] he says now that's what God's trying to
[2:01:55] get his church to
[2:01:58] to a place
[2:02:00] that where we our sons and daughters of
[2:02:04] God
[2:02:07] but we were troubled
[2:02:11] we're letting everything now the world's
[2:02:15] trying to smother the real thing down
[2:02:19] is trying to make people to scare the
[2:02:22] communism so the world's trying to
[2:02:24] smother the same thing now now I
[2:02:28] there's two things that
[2:02:31] I want to say here in closing and in a
[2:02:36] couple uh scriptures
[2:02:39] and and I wanted okay so we know what
[2:02:42] God's purpose is
[2:02:45] now I know you're struggling against the
[2:02:47] world I know you're struggling against
[2:02:49] the flash I know the Revival's over I've
[2:02:53] tried to lay that all out there
[2:02:56] you've got plenty of excuses
[2:02:59] to sit in the nest and rot
[2:03:05] okay
[2:03:07] I sympathize with you
[2:03:13] okay but I think God is
[2:03:16] by saying those things to us there's two
[2:03:20] things that are transpiring here
[2:03:23] one is called conviction
[2:03:27] God's deals and speaks to you through
[2:03:31] two Avenues
[2:03:34] and I don't have other ways to describe
[2:03:36] it so I'll try to give you some
[2:03:38] scriptures and
[2:03:40] not bog you down but I hope that you can
[2:03:43] just grasp this God's God to deal with
[2:03:47] you concerning the Inner Man
[2:03:50] just look in the scripture to start
[2:03:52] Romans 7
[2:03:54] 7 22.
[2:03:59] just Romans 7 22 Will Will just read
[2:04:04] that
[2:04:05] scripture really quick
[2:04:08] he says
[2:04:09] he says he says
[2:04:12] for I Delight in the law of God after
[2:04:16] the inward man
[2:04:19] if you read second Corinthians
[2:04:23] 4 and 16.
[2:04:33] second Corinthians 4 and 16.
[2:04:37] he says for which cause we faint not
[2:04:42] but through our outward man though our
[2:04:46] outward man perish yet the inward man is
[2:04:50] renewed day by day
[2:04:52] amen let's read Ephesians 3 and 16.
[2:04:58] Ephesians 3 and 16. Paul says this he
[2:05:02] says
[2:05:04] whom the whole family in Heaven and
[2:05:07] Earth is named that he would Grant you
[2:05:10] according to the riches of his glory to
[2:05:15] be strengthened with the might by his
[2:05:19] spirit in the inward man
[2:05:23] and so God is dealing so you have all
[2:05:28] these outward things
[2:05:30] all the revivals over
[2:05:33] nobody's interested in God you're living
[2:05:36] in Lady of SIA okay so you've got all
[2:05:40] this lousy world that we live in
[2:05:45] and there's nothing from the outside
[2:05:49] that's inspiring you to be a Christian
[2:05:52] there's no reward in this world but
[2:05:56] reproach
[2:05:58] as a brother told me the other day he
[2:06:01] said Just remember Brother David no good
[2:06:03] deed goes unpunished
[2:06:07] if if and that's the way it is
[2:06:10] right all right so if you're going to
[2:06:13] let this amnesia
[2:06:16] could this this we live in perilous
[2:06:19] times if you're going to let the
[2:06:21] darkness if you're going to let all all
[2:06:24] the excuses all the condition of the
[2:06:28] world if you're going to allow that to
[2:06:31] paralyze you
[2:06:35] and and become the hindrance
[2:06:40] to rise up and stop you
[2:06:43] well well then you're stuck dead in your
[2:06:46] tracks
[2:06:47] but we got to break through
[2:06:51] he's saying well God's trying to get us
[2:06:54] to where we can walk in the power and
[2:06:56] the faith of his word that we can be
[2:06:59] stimulated
[2:07:01] so there's a lot of Oppression
[2:07:05] and then
[2:07:08] I agree
[2:07:12] everybody wants to be popular nobody
[2:07:14] wants to be Christian
[2:07:19] the world don't want to hear about
[2:07:21] Christianity your job don't want to hear
[2:07:23] about Christianity your school don't
[2:07:25] want to hear about Christianity they
[2:07:28] don't want your ideas they don't want
[2:07:30] your thoughts so that's what he said you
[2:07:32] can't try to sell them on that now
[2:07:35] he says now you've got to demonstrate
[2:07:38] the power of the Resurrection
[2:07:44] you're just one more voice
[2:07:49] you open your mouth to people today and
[2:07:52] start talking about the lord they're
[2:07:54] just going to try to decide whether
[2:07:55] you're CNN or Fox
[2:08:01] you got to have something more than that
[2:08:04] you've got to fight for something more
[2:08:06] than that but you've got one thing
[2:08:09] we know that God is trying to get his
[2:08:13] church back to being the Sons and
[2:08:16] Daughters of God
[2:08:18] having that seal in their hand that the
[2:08:21] works that I do they'll do also
[2:08:27] now you've got to cook if I could decide
[2:08:30] that's what I want to say to you this
[2:08:31] morning
[2:08:33] if you've got to realize that God's got
[2:08:36] to navigate you
[2:08:39] through this dark and perilous Lady of
[2:08:43] sea and age
[2:08:45] blind miserable poor wretched naked and
[2:08:47] don't know it
[2:08:49] but he said those that hear my voice
[2:08:52] I will grant for them to come in and eat
[2:08:55] the evening meal with you so God is not
[2:08:59] so desperately interested in fixing all
[2:09:05] the problems that surround you
[2:09:12] you know you can pray all day Lord just
[2:09:15] put me the amongst people
[2:09:17] that just believe the way I believe
[2:09:22] thank you
[2:09:25] well as our brother testified Wednesday
[2:09:27] we can go create a community
[2:09:30] throw our cell phones away throw our
[2:09:32] electricity away throw our running water
[2:09:34] away
[2:09:36] right go back to horse and batteries
[2:09:38] just shut out the whole world
[2:09:41] live in our own thing
[2:09:45] but that's not what the scripture says
[2:09:47] it says we are in the world but we're
[2:09:50] not of the world
[2:09:52] we we light our candles we're a Shining
[2:09:57] Light to what we believe what we stand
[2:09:59] for what's right what's truth that's
[2:10:02] what we're here for
[2:10:04] we're here to find out can spread the
[2:10:07] good news that of course anybody else
[2:10:09] that's hungering and thirsting after
[2:10:11] righteousness
[2:10:12] so God deals with us
[2:10:16] and
[2:10:17] he deals with us through these two great
[2:10:20] words that I'm going to use
[2:10:24] and one is conviction
[2:10:30] he convicts the spirit convicts us of
[2:10:33] sin
[2:10:35] of unbelief
[2:10:37] he said when I send you the comforter
[2:10:39] when he comes he'll reprove the world
[2:10:42] because of sin or unbelief
[2:10:46] God convicts you
[2:10:49] [Applause]
[2:10:50] there's nothing wrong with coming under
[2:10:53] conviction
[2:10:57] that's how he deals with the inward man
[2:11:02] when you start to go astray you feel
[2:11:05] that conviction
[2:11:07] the conviction of the Holy Spirit the
[2:11:10] reprove on the Immigrant you might think
[2:11:13] everybody else in the world sees it I've
[2:11:16] sat in church under the preaching of the
[2:11:18] word of God and thought every eye in
[2:11:21] that place was on me they all know he's
[2:11:23] talking about me
[2:11:28] nobody knew nothing
[2:11:31] but my inward man
[2:11:34] Ward man knew I wasn't reading my Bible
[2:11:36] my man knew I wasn't praying and making
[2:11:40] intercession father he's just like you
[2:11:42] interested in the Lost interested in The
[2:11:45] Afflicted interested that ought to bring
[2:11:48] conviction to us
[2:11:52] it ought to it ought to speak to us he's
[2:11:55] speaking to the inner man he's
[2:11:57] convicting us of our unbelief
[2:12:00] you're not living right
[2:12:03] you might be perfect and then he'll
[2:12:05] convict you you're not doing anything
[2:12:08] show me your faith without your works
[2:12:10] I'll show you my faith by my works one
[2:12:13] of the ways he deals with us is through
[2:12:16] conviction
[2:12:18] conviction is not condemnation
[2:12:26] conviction is what allows you to know
[2:12:30] you need help
[2:12:35] God doesn't convict you to condemn you
[2:12:38] he convicts you to let you know he's
[2:12:41] there to make a difference
[2:12:46] you can sit in church and everything's
[2:12:49] fine tell the word of God crosses the
[2:12:52] problem you have
[2:12:56] and then you feel convicted
[2:12:59] it might feel like condemnation
[2:13:03] but condemnation is a final judgment
[2:13:08] if you reject the conviction you get
[2:13:11] condemnation
[2:13:13] but he deals with you by convicting Your
[2:13:16] Heart by speaking to Your Heart by
[2:13:19] addressing you addressing your thought
[2:13:21] addressing your action he's bringing you
[2:13:24] conviction he keeps he's trying to stir
[2:13:26] up that inward man and get a message to
[2:13:30] the inward man
[2:13:33] that's what the spirit does
[2:13:37] it convicts us of unbelief it convicts
[2:13:40] us of sin
[2:13:43] so you're living your life if you
[2:13:45] understand trying to bring it down home
[2:13:47] you're dealing in your daily life you're
[2:13:49] going to come up against this situation
[2:13:51] you're going to come up against that
[2:13:53] situation you're going to come up
[2:13:55] against this person you've got to be
[2:13:57] aware that God is going to convict you
[2:14:03] I don't want that to be something that
[2:14:06] goes away
[2:14:10] I wanted to be something I'm more aware
[2:14:12] of
[2:14:16] I've taken all kinds of classes on on
[2:14:20] protection and and and you know how to
[2:14:24] keep safe and all those things and the
[2:14:26] thing they begin to teach us know your
[2:14:29] surroundings know your situation
[2:14:32] you know don't walk close to an alley
[2:14:34] entrance don't stay out away where you
[2:14:37] can be seen stay out a way where you
[2:14:39] can't be reached all these things that
[2:14:41] they teach you it's all about an
[2:14:42] awareness
[2:14:45] now can you imagine going through this
[2:14:48] life and not being aware of how that God
[2:14:51] is trying to speak to you
[2:14:57] he deals with you through conviction
[2:15:02] thank God
[2:15:05] how would I know

[2:15:31] people say well I want to hear an
[2:15:32] audible Voice or I want he convicts your
[2:15:35] heart
[2:15:37] he brings you under conviction
[2:15:42] we should be so aware of that so
[2:15:45] conscious of that but if you just keep
[2:15:47] overriding that conviction and Order of
[2:15:50] writing that conviction and it gives
[2:15:52] dollar to you and dollar to you and you
[2:15:56] know you might turn on a song the first
[2:15:58] timing and you feel that conviction that
[2:16:00] song ain't right
[2:16:02] but you like that beat
[2:16:05] you like that beat
[2:16:07] you just like that beat

[2:16:27] me he's talking me don't go there don't
[2:16:31] do that don't go that fast don't think
[2:16:33] that way he's there every time the
[2:16:35] spirit of God is there to convict the
[2:16:38] believer of sin
[2:16:43] he does it
[2:16:46] he's trying to get this church in a
[2:16:48] place where they can manifest the word
[2:16:50] and manifest him in the flesh and if
[2:16:53] they can't hear the conviction of his
[2:16:56] Spirit the stop signs the the slowdowns
[2:16:59] the the don't do that don't think that
[2:17:03] don't go there
[2:17:07] Satan don't care if you hear the gospel
[2:17:11] if it don't convict you
[2:17:16] how do you think it was when he talked
[2:17:18] about that bobbed hair and makeup and
[2:17:20] all that stuff and all the women in
[2:17:22] there
[2:17:24] you think any of them felt conviction
[2:17:29] I felt conviction
[2:17:31] just hearing that tape
[2:17:35] realizing that I'm a little short here
[2:17:38] praise God
[2:17:40] conviction means that he's got something
[2:17:44] there to help
[2:17:49] he's not convicting it condemned he's
[2:17:52] convicting to alter your ways correct it
[2:17:56] does not mean condemnation it means to
[2:18:00] alter the direction that you're going in
[2:18:03] it's a change of course conviction is
[2:18:07] there to change your course
[2:18:10] you're going down a certain way
[2:18:12] everything's fine boom conviction comes
[2:18:15] up something stirs up on your inside you
[2:18:19] get that question that's raised in your
[2:18:21] heart that little doubt
[2:18:24] that rises out
[2:18:26] where there's a doubt you do what you
[2:18:29] leave it out you stop
[2:18:33] you pray about it you filter it through
[2:18:36] the word
[2:18:39] don't be afraid of conviction
[2:18:43] I pray for it
[2:18:46] father convict my heart
[2:18:48] if there's anything in my life that's
[2:18:51] not like you what convict me of it deal
[2:18:55] with me show me
[2:18:59] can you imagine a young girl meeting a
[2:19:02] guy you know he's a sweet talker
[2:19:05] you know you know all the girls think
[2:19:09] she's just the guy
[2:19:13] he's so handsome and he's the
[2:19:16] quarterback and everything like that he
[2:19:19] just comes all soft-spoken and you think
[2:19:21] oh he picked me
[2:19:25] you know your ego's just blooming all
[2:19:28] over the place and he ain't got nothing
[2:19:30] but a pitchfork and a couple forked
[2:19:33] horns and just a sweet talker he don't
[2:19:35] have one good intention about you your
[2:19:37] reputation or nothing you'll feel a
[2:19:40] conviction
[2:19:42] but you override that conviction
[2:19:45] and you get to the place that that
[2:19:47] conviction doesn't deal with you anymore
[2:19:51] then God might have to go to a more
[2:19:53] drastic measure
[2:19:55] we don't want to go there we're talking
[2:19:58] about being led into Perfection this
[2:20:00] morning one of the ways that God deals
[2:20:03] with his church and speak to you is
[2:20:07] through conviction be aware of
[2:20:12] conviction be aware of that stop be
[2:20:16] aware of that voice be aware of that
[2:20:18] feeling that that that I don't know I
[2:20:22] don't have words to express it but in my
[2:20:25] life I can just feel that little shaking
[2:20:27] and little trembling
[2:20:29] on the inside
[2:20:32] something ain't right here
[2:20:34] this ain't right I might not know what
[2:20:36] it is he don't have to explain
[2:20:39] but if he convicts you
[2:20:42] stop
[2:20:45] because God's trying to lead you
[2:20:47] somewhere
[2:20:49] doesn't have to be good or evil
[2:20:52] there's a lot of good things that are
[2:20:55] lawful but they're just not expedient
[2:21:01] they're not good
[2:21:03] to transform you
[2:21:06] into what he wants you to be
[2:21:10] you might have a great plan a great work
[2:21:12] that you want to do for God at something
[2:21:15] just ain't right about it your heart's
[2:21:18] under conviction you really don't feel
[2:21:20] like going that way
[2:21:24] and he stops you
[2:21:26] our messenger was on his way to Israel
[2:21:31] the spirit convicted him
[2:21:34] didn't he condemn them it stopped them
[2:21:37] don't call
[2:21:39] it's not the right time your ministry
[2:21:42] will misrepresent to them I don't know
[2:21:46] all the reasons
[2:21:48] you understand it it doesn't hurt to
[2:21:52] stop
[2:21:54] conviction now God's dealing with that
[2:21:57] not on this outside man not in this
[2:22:00] fleshly man he's dealing with the Inner
[2:22:03] Man
[2:22:06] that inner heart
[2:22:10] don't keep walking over that
[2:22:13] conviction
[2:22:16] no wonder he said you've got to fight
[2:22:18] your way into trouble
[2:22:21] it's hard to go to hell
[2:22:24] you have to drop every voice every
[2:22:27] conviction everything keep dropping it
[2:22:29] down pushing it down pushing it down and
[2:22:32] I hope that even in listening to that
[2:22:34] tape you you take an examination of
[2:22:37] yourself and you come under conviction
[2:22:40] hey I'm not really pressing the mark
[2:22:44] I'm living that when I get to the
[2:22:47] Judgment I hope that he just decides I
[2:22:49] can come in
[2:22:53] uh-huh
[2:22:55] that's like
[2:22:58] I just don't even know if I can even
[2:23:01] come up with an example of how scary
[2:23:04] that is
[2:23:09] make full proof
[2:23:11] and I wanted to finish
[2:23:14] this morning
[2:23:16] if we could uh
[2:23:19] turn to first John
[2:23:42] and the second chapter of verse dime
[2:23:52] now this has many different
[2:23:55] terminologies
[2:23:57] that we use but I'd like just to read
[2:24:00] the rest of the chapter starting in the
[2:24:04] 18th verse
[2:24:12] let's just start with the 15th verse and
[2:24:15] we'll read this verse and go as we begin
[2:24:18] to close this morning
[2:24:21] love not the world neither the things
[2:24:24] that are in the world
[2:24:27] If any man love the world the love
[2:24:31] of the father is not in him
[2:24:35] for all that is in the world the lust of
[2:24:39] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[2:24:43] the pride of life is not of the father
[2:24:46] but of the world
[2:24:49] if that brings you under conviction
[2:24:51] that's good
[2:24:54] that's God saying I have something
[2:24:58] that I can exchange
[2:25:02] that for
[2:25:04] I can give you
[2:25:07] For the Love of the world I can give you
[2:25:09] the love of God
[2:25:12] for the unless of the eyes I can give
[2:25:16] you ice have
[2:25:20] conviction is good
[2:25:22] conviction is God's way of saying to you
[2:25:26] I have something different for you
[2:25:31] stop
[2:25:33] don't go there I've got something
[2:25:35] different
[2:25:37] God never criticizes
[2:25:41] without a solution
[2:25:45] God never does anything that he hasn't
[2:25:48] done himself
[2:25:51] that's a quote
[2:25:54] so when you got convicted conviction
[2:25:56] isn't no that's bad conviction is God's
[2:25:59] way and don't take that I've got
[2:26:02] something for you I've got word for you
[2:26:05] I've got spirit for you I've got
[2:26:07] understanding for you I've got eyes have
[2:26:09] for you I've got gold Trident and fire
[2:26:12] for you I've got white reniment for you
[2:26:15] conviction is God's way of letting you
[2:26:19] know that he has something else
[2:26:24] that's what I hope we concentrate on
[2:26:26] it's it's what's God's Got What the
[2:26:29] tutor has
[2:26:31] what he's trying
[2:26:33] certain choices in our life is going to
[2:26:37] produce certain results
[2:26:40] and God wants to keep you
[2:26:44] from burying the fruits of decisions
[2:26:48] that don't allow you to become more like
[2:26:51] him
[2:26:57] you let an infection go untreated
[2:27:01] and a little infection
[2:27:04] that could be treated with a little bit
[2:27:06] of antibiotics can turn into amputation
[2:27:13] no amputation will save you
[2:27:19] and he will amputate
[2:27:24] let me give the spiritual thing he will
[2:27:26] prune
[2:27:30] he'll remove the dead branches he'll
[2:27:32] prune you
[2:27:37] you best treat it
[2:27:39] you know a lot of things sicknesses go
[2:27:42] into remission
[2:27:45] to the treatment stops them
[2:27:48] for a while
[2:27:50] but they never Purge it out
[2:27:54] and that's why he said in order to be
[2:27:56] born again you've got to die first you
[2:27:59] can't be born again until you die
[2:28:02] conviction is what God uses to bring you
[2:28:05] to death
[2:28:07] to where you say I want that out I I
[2:28:10] don't want this to be bothering me more
[2:28:12] I want to put an end to it I'm ready to
[2:28:15] die out now so it can be removed
[2:28:19] so many Christians has put things in
[2:28:21] remission and then they try to go on in
[2:28:24] life and all of a sudden here it comes
[2:28:26] back
[2:28:29] and here they're dealing with it again
[2:28:31] when they thought things were going good
[2:28:36] let conviction have its full effect
[2:28:46] conviction is wonderful
[2:28:54] for all that
[2:28:56] he said
[2:28:57] and the world passes away
[2:29:00] and the lust thereof
[2:29:03] but he that doth the will of God abideth
[2:29:06] forever
[2:29:07] what great wisdom
[2:29:10] that little thing that he's stopping you
[2:29:13] from that will pass away
[2:29:16] all the lust of the flesh the lust of
[2:29:19] the eye all those things will pass away
[2:29:21] the pride of life but those that do the
[2:29:24] will of the father
[2:29:29] abideth forever
[2:29:31] little children
[2:29:33] it is the last time
[2:29:38] and as ye have heard the Antichrist
[2:29:41] shall come
[2:29:43] and even now are there many antichrists
[2:29:47] whereby we know that it is the last
[2:29:52] time
[2:29:58] somebody believes that
[2:30:02] they went out from us
[2:30:05] but they were not of us
[2:30:08] for if they had been of us they wouldn't
[2:30:12] no doubt have continued with us
[2:30:16] but they went out
[2:30:18] that they might
[2:30:21] be made manifest
[2:30:23] that they are not all of us
[2:30:29] but ye have an unction
[2:30:33] from the Holy One and ye know all things
[2:30:38] that's the second way that God deals and
[2:30:42] leads his church is with unction
[2:30:48] you know what the word unction means it
[2:30:51] comes from meaning anointing
[2:30:54] being smeared
[2:30:56] with oil
[2:30:58] he deals with you by anointing you I'm
[2:31:02] closing just hold on for a second
[2:31:04] that little voice in the inward man
[2:31:09] that little unction
[2:31:12] that little call
[2:31:14] that little draw that little
[2:31:19] thing that you just feel led to do
[2:31:23] that inward voice that inner man that
[2:31:27] Holy unction
[2:31:29] he says by that unction ye know all
[2:31:32] things
[2:31:34] think of it
[2:31:36] we're talking about how does God lead us
[2:31:38] how does he speak to us I'm living in
[2:31:41] this last hour I'm living this perilous
[2:31:43] time I'm living in this time where
[2:31:45] they've rejected the lord they're
[2:31:48] totally no light we're in the lady
[2:31:50] you'll see an age there's total darkness
[2:31:53] how is God going to get through to me he
[2:31:56] can't use any of these other channels
[2:31:59] he's going to talk to the inward man
[2:32:02] he's going to talk you through
[2:32:04] conviction and through unction
[2:32:12] can you identify the two in your life
[2:32:18] can you identify when God's giving you
[2:32:21] that little push
[2:32:24] that little tug
[2:32:26] that little call
[2:32:28] that little awareness
[2:32:31] that little
[2:32:32] voice
[2:32:35] that's still Small Voice another term
[2:32:38] for an unction
[2:32:40] that deep calling to the Deep another
[2:32:43] term for her unction that little feeling
[2:32:47] LED I just feel led I feel led to seeing
[2:32:51] this song I feel led to do that I feel
[2:32:54] led to be testified
[2:32:57] I have that Uncle I have this compelling
[2:33:00] Fort inside of me that's moving me in a
[2:33:05] certain direction that's the spirit the
[2:33:08] oil
[2:33:09] anointing you unctioning you smearing
[2:33:12] you with this oil that's where the word
[2:33:14] unction comes from
[2:33:17] that's how he deals with you
[2:33:20] can you imagine if we get to the place
[2:33:22] that we're not affected by that anymore
[2:33:25] we're not affected by conviction we're
[2:33:27] not affected we go into what
[2:33:30] intellectual religion
[2:33:34] it won't work
[2:33:37] and God will not allow it to work
[2:33:44] he won't allow it
[2:33:48] now he's if he's going to deal with us
[2:33:51] not only as individuals but as a church
[2:33:54] as a body we've all got to come into
[2:33:57] tune
[2:34:00] I just want to finish reading I know
[2:34:02] it's tired but
[2:34:04] at least it's air-conditioned in here
[2:34:08] he says you have a have an unction
[2:34:11] from the Holy One and you know all
[2:34:14] things I have not written unto you
[2:34:16] because ye know not the truth
[2:34:20] but because you know it
[2:34:23] and that no lie is of the truth
[2:34:30] who is a liar
[2:34:33] but he that denieth that Jesus is the
[2:34:36] Christ
[2:34:37] he is Antichrist that denieth the father
[2:34:41] and the son whosoever denieth the son
[2:34:45] the same hath deny hath not the father
[2:34:50] but he that acknowledged the son
[2:34:53] hath the father can I say that that's
[2:34:57] the word
[2:34:59] you can't deny the promised word of God
[2:35:01] for this hour and say you have the
[2:35:03] father
[2:35:05] this is not a man-made Ministry
[2:35:08] [Music]
[2:35:11] it has not something that a man came
[2:35:13] along and had a meeting with God and
[2:35:16] felt inspired and and said I I'm going
[2:35:19] to believe I'm going to pray for the
[2:35:20] sick and be for a Prophet this was an
[2:35:23] anointed vessel that was brought to this
[2:35:27] Earth for the sole purpose of delivering
[2:35:30] to this church this morning that we are
[2:35:35] being called to be at Sons and Daughters
[2:35:39] of God
[2:35:45] and that's his purpose
[2:35:47] is to have sons and daughters like he is
[2:35:50] herein is the love of God made perfect
[2:35:54] that as he is so are we in this world
[2:36:01] do you understand that this morning he
[2:36:04] is trying to turn you transform you
[2:36:09] through the whole process of your life
[2:36:11] you didn't get the Holy Spirit when you
[2:36:13] did you just began to bring you to the
[2:36:17] full maturity of a statue of a perfect
[2:36:20] man where the love of God is shed abroad
[2:36:23] in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit
[2:36:27] we're in a perfection
[2:36:29] the Tudor's here
[2:36:33] and he's telling you I I can't deal with
[2:36:36] you through that world anymore
[2:36:41] there's no Avenue left to the world
[2:36:46] I'll send you the comforter and he'll
[2:36:50] reprove you of sin and lead you into all
[2:36:54] truth and righteousness
[2:36:58] who now he can only deal with one thing
[2:37:01] he's only got one thing left
[2:37:03] that's preaching of the word but if it
[2:37:07] doesn't convict you and it doesn't give
[2:37:09] you unction
[2:37:12] then what good is it
[2:37:16] I could go out here and preach to the
[2:37:18] tree stumps
[2:37:23] same word
[2:37:25] same gospel
[2:37:28] but God's going to take the words that
[2:37:31] are preached
[2:37:32] and he's going to transform
[2:37:35] transfer them
[2:37:37] to the inner manned through conviction
[2:37:41] or unction
[2:37:46] that's how he's going to deal with it
[2:37:49] you've got to become completely aware
[2:37:51] that God is trying to speak to you every
[2:37:55] day
[2:37:59] though the outer man perish
[2:38:03] praise God we are strengthened in the
[2:38:06] Inner Man
[2:38:07] though the world around us is perishing
[2:38:10] the inner man is still alive
[2:38:16] though the conditions are getting
[2:38:18] terrible
[2:38:20] they want to take Christ out of
[2:38:22] Christmas they want to take the Bibles
[2:38:24] down they want to remove the Ten
[2:38:27] Commandments from the courthouse they
[2:38:29] will they want to take crosses down
[2:38:36] don't matter
[2:38:40] they can't stop him from speaking to the
[2:38:43] Inner Man
[2:38:46] amen
[2:38:49] they can't stop him from convicting you
[2:38:51] and reproving you of unbelief they can't
[2:38:54] stop the anointed one anointing your
[2:38:57] spirit and giving you the unction and
[2:39:00] the leadership to do the right thing
[2:39:04] boy if it's ever now
[2:39:07] that you need to connect
[2:39:09] with the tutor
[2:39:12] and cut off these other voices
[2:39:15] let us just finish reading
[2:39:18] I I just don't feel I have the ability
[2:39:21] this morning but I guess I'm just
[2:39:23] trusting that the tutor and the function
[2:39:25] and the conviction will do the work for
[2:39:28] me
[2:39:33] he said
[2:39:34] let that therefore abide in you what
[2:39:39] what's he talking about
[2:39:41] that Holy unction
[2:39:44] that was giving you to the Holy One let
[2:39:47] that therefore abide in you which ye
[2:39:50] have heard from the beginning
[2:39:53] if that which ye have heard from the
[2:39:57] beginning shall remain in you ye shall
[2:40:01] continue in the Sun and in the father
[2:40:08] and this is the promise that he hath
[2:40:11] promised us even eternal life
[2:40:15] these things have I written unto you
[2:40:20] concerning them that seduce you why is
[2:40:24] he writing these things because there's
[2:40:26] a seducing Spirit the Antichrist spirit
[2:40:30] is at work
[2:40:35] there there were actually you
[2:40:38] I mean I'm going to lose it I'm sure but

[2:40:45] with artificial intelligence
[2:40:50] the world is worried
[2:40:53] that artificial intelligence is going to
[2:40:56] take over the world
[2:41:00] this is not the Twilight Zone this is
[2:41:03] worse than the Twilight Zone this is not
[2:41:06] the outer limits this is worse than the
[2:41:08] outer limits
[2:41:14] it's insane
[2:41:19] Clay's saying we better get a hold of
[2:41:21] this artificial intelligence else
[2:41:24] there will be no turning back
[2:41:31] not even human thinking
[2:41:37] maybe you're not scared of it
[2:41:41] well I ain't as scared of it
[2:41:44] because guess what
[2:41:46] there's another intelligence
[2:41:49] the one that causes the sap to go into
[2:41:51] the tree the ones that cause the one
[2:41:54] that's going to speak to me it's going
[2:41:56] to convict me it's going to give me holy
