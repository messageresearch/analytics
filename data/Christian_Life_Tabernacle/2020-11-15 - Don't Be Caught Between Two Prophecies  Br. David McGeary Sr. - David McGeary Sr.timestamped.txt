[41:47] let's go ahead and open our Bibles and
[41:50] and
[41:54] uh we let's turn to uh
[41:58] Revelations uh the thir chapter and
[42:01] let's just remind ourselves this morning
[42:04] as we uh read the scriptures uh uh
[42:10] concerning the age that we're living in
[42:14] and we certainly uh are grateful to have
[42:17] those of you that have come out to the
[42:19] house of the Lord this morning uh those
[42:22] that are
[42:24] uh uh streaming or watching online I
[42:28] know we have a few uh in in the morning
[42:33] uh we certainly uh miss you we want you
[42:36] to know that we miss you it seems some I
[42:40] haven't seen since April I guess it's
[42:43] been a long time and and U just hard to
[42:47] believe huh that it's actually things
[42:51] have gotten like this but uh we're going
[42:53] to be
[42:54] victorious amen that's the thing so
[42:57] let's read in Revelations the 3r chapter
[43:01] and we'll start with the 14th
[43:05] verse and
[43:07] uh it says and unto the angel of the
[43:12] Church of L oia write these
[43:17] things saith the amen the faithful and
[43:21] true witness the beginning of the
[43:24] creation of God I know Know Thy works
[43:28] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[43:33] would thou work cold or hot so then
[43:37] because Thou Art glute war and neither
[43:41] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[43:47] mouth because thou sayth I am rich and
[43:51] increase with goods and have need of
[43:55] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[43:59] wretched and miserable and poor and
[44:04] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[44:09] me gold tried in fire that thou mayest
[44:13] be rich and white renant that thou
[44:16] mayest be clothed that the shame of thy
[44:20] nakedness does not
[44:22] appear and anoint thine eyes with IAB
[44:27] that thou mayest see as many as I love I
[44:32] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[44:36] and
[44:38] repent behold I stand at the door and
[44:42] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[44:46] the door I will come into him and will
[44:51] Su with him and he with
[44:53] me to him that overcometh will will I
[44:57] grant to sit with me in my Throne Lord
[45:01] even as I also overcame am in set down
[45:06] with my father in his throne he that
[45:09] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[45:13] saith unto the churches may the Lord out
[45:16] his blessings to his word Jesus name we
[45:19] pray amen God bless you you may be
[45:25] seated uh this is
[45:28] uh certainly a
[45:32] uh as we know that this is certainly a
[45:38] great uh scripture
[45:41] reading that is so
[45:45] uh so directed to a certain group of
[45:50] people and to a certain time and uh you
[45:54] know it it's wonderful
[45:57] that you can take the word of God this
[46:00] morning and know that God could
[46:02] so have such a
[46:05] comprehension and being the author and
[46:08] the finisher of our faith to have such
[46:13] uh a reach uh of being omnipresent and
[46:18] omnipotent and all knowing that he could
[46:22] take the things of the word of God and
[46:25] actually lay out out in the
[46:28] scripture uh the word of God for every
[46:32] Age and and leave us with
[46:36] instructions and and yet in speaking it
[46:41] all and writing it all through the
[46:44] scriptures and as the scripture tells us
[46:48] in diverse Times by diverse manners God
[46:51] through His prophets that he spoke to us
[46:55] but yet be able to seal it
[46:58] up in a way that it could lay there and
[47:02] it be written and written just for you
[47:06] with your name on it you know where it
[47:10] wouldn't fit for no other age no other
[47:12] time it's got your name on it it's just
[47:15] like it was packaged and wrapped with
[47:19] your name on it just for you and it was
[47:22] it was sent and when when you got here
[47:27] in your life the word of God arrived and
[47:31] you were able to open it up and you say
[47:34] well how was it packaged it was packaged
[47:37] in
[47:39] Revelation that's how it was packaged it
[47:42] was it was something that had to be
[47:44] unfolded to you had to be opened up it
[47:48] it had to be shown you and that's how
[47:51] you know that it's uh yours is that he
[47:55] puts your name on it and he shows it to
[47:58] you and said this is what I got for you
[48:01] and this is uh you know the scriptures
[48:04] it's a gift to us this morning I mean it
[48:08] it's beautiful so just think of these
[48:10] things that we
[48:12] have it it's the Lord warning
[48:16] us of what we have to be careful of in
[48:22] this
[48:23] day and you know and it it's something
[48:26] about God God's not a respector of
[48:29] persons you know uh there's there's not
[48:32] a different gospel written for different
[48:35] groups of people people from different
[48:38] countries it's it's not written by
[48:41] region there's not a gospel for for the
[48:46] Southern Hemisphere and a gospel for the
[48:48] Northern Hemisphere there's not a gospel
[48:52] for the western United States and the
[48:55] eastern United day the gospel is the
[48:58] same Eternal Word of God that came from
[49:02] the beginning and because of that
[49:06] because of that that that God so loved
[49:09] the world it didn't say he so loved a
[49:12] part of the world he so loved the world
[49:15] that he gave his only begotten son so
[49:18] we're all able to come under the the
[49:23] great word of God so the word of God was
[49:26] given to those who have an ear to hear
[49:30] amen and and so uh and so he he he just
[49:36] so beautifully spoke these things and
[49:40] and he warns us he warns us in this age
[49:45] that we're living in of a great
[49:50] complacency that was going to come on
[49:53] the people if I could sumon Up This Way
[49:57] Lady oia is an
[50:00] attitude it it it's what it is it's a
[50:03] it's people's rights it's a it's kind of
[50:07] an attitude that that that science and
[50:11] education was going to develop so he
[50:14] warned us and and this is the first
[50:16] warning I'd like to uh just point out
[50:20] this morning that we want to just talk
[50:23] to to us about this morning in our sun
[50:26] school
[50:28] it's he
[50:30] says write these things the faithful and
[50:33] true witness the beginning of the
[50:34] creation I Know Thy Works yes sir that
[50:37] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[50:43] thou work cold or hot amen so so then
[50:49] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[50:52] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[50:55] mouth now what a what a
[51:00] a I'm I'm glad to hear
[51:03] that you know what I mean I I want to
[51:06] know what is expected of me I want to
[51:11] know what God is
[51:14] concerned about and then he says because
[51:17] Thou Art uh you you're rich and you
[51:22] increase with goods and you say I have
[51:26] need of nothing so we start to see the
[51:29] things that the Lord wants to uh point
[51:33] out to us that we have to be aware of we
[51:36] have to be aware of the fact that we we
[51:39] can get into the place that we say I
[51:42] don't have need of
[51:44] anything I I've got it in other words if
[51:47] I could place it like this there's not a
[51:52] hungering and a
[51:54] thirsting and there's not not a calling
[51:58] in other words the longing in your heart
[52:02] for more of God and and more Revelation
[52:06] and more understanding and a greater
[52:10] increase in the things of God you get to
[52:13] the place and and I know I've been
[52:16] talking on these lines over and over
[52:19] again but you get into a place that
[52:22] because of the educational system and
[52:27] things and the fact that you have such
[52:29] increase with knowledge yes sir and
[52:32] increase with Goods what an age that we
[52:35] increase with knowledge isn't it and you
[52:38] begin and you begin to to to see that uh
[52:44] that this great increase in in
[52:47] everything that's presented to you that
[52:50] that hunger and that
[52:53] thirst begins to subside
[52:57] and and the Lord is warning us now be
[53:01] careful yes sir that that great deep
[53:06] that wants to call to the deep that
[53:08] great thirst for the things of God that
[53:12] great hunger for for more of God be
[53:15] careful when you see that starting to
[53:20] subside when when there's something else
[53:23] satisfying that when uh there
[53:27] something else is fulfilling uh your
[53:30] hunger and uh you know the that's the
[53:34] world has all kinds of those things that
[53:37] that if you drink this it helps Subs
[53:39] take away your appetite and or you you
[53:42] take this and it helps give you energy
[53:45] and you got they got all these
[53:47] supplements and all these
[53:49] substitutes and everything and so the
[53:52] spirit in our age is warning us that
[53:56] when you get to this age lady oia you're
[53:59] going to be in an age with much
[54:03] increase and and you're going to be in
[54:06] an age where the there's a
[54:11] spirit of to be
[54:14] lukewarm sir or to be caught in the
[54:17] middle and if I if I would had a a title
[54:21] this morning uh I I would kind of the
[54:25] thought would I want to share with you
[54:27] this morning is don't be caught in
[54:30] between two
[54:34] prophecies don't don't be caught in
[54:36] between two prophecies this morning and
[54:40] so we we know that we know that there
[54:45] are two
[54:47] great spirits do we all understand that
[54:52] see that's the whole thing about lady
[54:54] oia is that Satan just kind of Blends in
[54:57] he kind of just gets out of the picture
[55:00] now he's he he's covered up but we have
[55:04] a prophecy yes sir that tells us that
[55:10] there would be a kingdom Rise Up The
[55:15] Prince and power of the air The Prince
[55:19] and power of this Earth we understand
[55:23] that in these great uh this great battle
[55:28] that started in the beginning and and
[55:31] came down to earth this great war that
[55:35] started we understand that there's two
[55:37] sides there's only two spirits that
[55:42] control the
[55:43] Earth the spirit of God and the spirit
[55:47] of Satan amen there's only two Powers no
[55:51] matter how they dress themselves up no
[55:55] matter how they present
[55:57] themselves there's only two things that
[56:00] are
[56:01] working and and can you imagine the
[56:05] vanity of
[56:06] man that he thinks he's so independent
[56:10] and so smart and so free that he he
[56:16] doesn't even realize that he's under the
[56:19] control of one of these two
[56:23] Powers that's the deception
[56:26] we know that we that we're told in the
[56:29] scriptures that we live in perilous
[56:32] times sir that perilous time shall come
[56:36] that men should be lovers of pleasure
[56:39] more than lovers of God so all these
[56:43] things have been spoken out to us all
[56:45] these things have been prophesied to us
[56:48] all these things have been told us about
[56:51] this uh about these two things so we
[56:54] know that there there's two sides if I
[56:58] could say it one is the side of the
[57:01] enemy and we call that side we call it
[57:05] the God of this evil
[57:07] age and Satan's
[57:11] Eden okay so we know this in in our
[57:14] scripture reading today we know it was
[57:17] the Church of Lady oia the lukewarm
[57:22] church that didn't feel that they had
[57:25] need of nothing
[57:26] and so each of these each of these
[57:29] things were uh uh
[57:32] prophesied uh to us and and told us what
[57:37] was going to transpire now so I'd like
[57:39] to just read as I if I I could hear
[57:46] uh uh to understand so each of these
[57:50] things and and first of all I want to
[57:52] take Satan's side okay so s
[57:56] is
[57:57] God he wanted to build an
[58:01] Eden he saw what God
[58:04] built he looked at it and he said no
[58:08] there's more to
[58:10] this you know what I mean he he he had a
[58:14] a a okay he had an
[58:17] ambition something that he wanted to
[58:20] achieve so on one side we have Satan's
[58:24] ambition
[58:27] okay he's a
[58:29] power you understand he's an influential
[58:32] power that he's trying to achieve
[58:36] something so he's trying to preach
[58:40] something he's trying he's got something
[58:43] that he wants to offer that he wants us
[58:48] to buy
[58:49] into to join up to to become part of so
[58:55] he was the first
[58:58] salesman you know what I mean and so he
[59:01] he went to Eve and he began to sell her
[59:06] and and and talk to her and and and and
[59:10] try to explain to her she he she said
[59:14] she well he told me not to partake of
[59:16] this fruit of this tree of Good and Evil
[59:20] and he said oh yeah the reason he does
[59:23] that because if you partake of this
[59:26] you will become like
[59:30] gods and Eve listened to him but her
[59:35] failure was is that she believed his lie
[59:39] as God's
[59:41] truth God made a simple statement the
[59:44] day that you eat thereof is the day that
[59:47] you will die in other words there's a
[59:50] something that comes along with this
[59:53] fruit there's something that comes along
[59:56] with with knowledge this tree of Good
[1:00:00] and Evil the knowledge of tree of Good
[1:00:03] and Evil so there's something that comes
[1:00:05] along with the benefits if I could say
[1:00:09] that of knowledge and of Science and of
[1:00:13] education and of
[1:00:15] civilization if you want to take this
[1:00:19] path to to have all this great science
[1:00:23] open up to you all this great
[1:00:25] intelligence open up to you if you want
[1:00:28] to go down this road where you can have
[1:00:31] Technologies and and you can do things
[1:00:35] that you couldn't even imagine of doing
[1:00:37] can you imagine Adam standing here on
[1:00:41] the earth and in his beautiful kingdom
[1:00:43] of Eden and and Satan knowing I can take
[1:00:47] you and shoot you to the
[1:00:53] Moon I mean what an achievement
[1:00:56] I can I've got things I I I see cities
[1:01:00] oh you don't think so he offered them he
[1:01:02] offered the kingdoms to Jesus he had a
[1:01:05] vision of what he was trying to
[1:01:08] accomplish he had a he knew what he was
[1:01:11] trying to achieve he saw the great great
[1:01:14] society and the great buildings and the
[1:01:17] great science and the great internet and
[1:01:20] the great things that man could do if
[1:01:23] they would just eat yeah of this science
[1:01:29] and of this knowledge
[1:01:32] sir it was right there yeah Satan saw it
[1:01:36] all he saw all that man could do
[1:01:40] everything that he could accomplish all
[1:01:43] the things that they could achieve and
[1:01:46] do there was only one
[1:01:50] problem death came with that
[1:01:56] it was
[1:01:58] there but Satan in his
[1:02:02] vanity he thought he could
[1:02:05] overcome
[1:02:09] death he thought eventually he could
[1:02:11] medical himself out of it he could he
[1:02:15] could
[1:02:17] scientifically come to the research and
[1:02:20] the things to get it and and we hear it
[1:02:23] all the time people that want to to
[1:02:26] freeze their body or something and and
[1:02:30] save it and
[1:02:34] tell I want to go
[1:02:37] home that's right could you imagine some
[1:02:41] poor soul being froze back in
[1:02:46] 1920 or something and thaw out
[1:02:51] today and coming in this
[1:02:53] world what a disappoint appointment yeah
[1:02:56] that's
[1:02:58] right what a
[1:03:01] disappointment but you have to
[1:03:02] understand this is what that he he
[1:03:04] thought he saw all these great things
[1:03:07] that he wanted to
[1:03:09] do all this great
[1:03:11] vastness that that that was available
[1:03:15] but God knew that was there yeah but he
[1:03:18] knew that those
[1:03:20] wages and the wages of sin and the wages
[1:03:24] of science and the wages of civilization
[1:03:28] and the wages of knowledge was death and
[1:03:32] man has been dying ever
[1:03:37] since I there
[1:03:41] there's one
[1:03:43] record of one that overcame
[1:03:46] death and whoever believed on him he
[1:03:50] would give them the same life that he
[1:03:53] had to overcome death
[1:03:57] that's right so we find this great
[1:04:00] Kingdom's raised here and the wages of
[1:04:02] that kingdom is death and this what he
[1:04:05] says it was Satan's ambition to be
[1:04:08] worshiped like
[1:04:10] God he took 2third of the stars of
[1:04:14] Heaven ascended himself above those
[1:04:18] stars and preached to them and deceived
[1:04:22] 2third of them you see it
[1:04:26] notice it's his
[1:04:28] ambition now how is he ready with his
[1:04:33] carful selected educated bride by his
[1:04:37] own knowledge see all painted up in his
[1:04:41] deceit of big buildings and big
[1:04:45] denomination and paints of knowledge and
[1:04:49] Theology and smart intellectual educated
[1:04:54] to deceive the whole
[1:04:58] world and become a
[1:05:01] God that's what he's done all headed up
[1:05:06] into the person of the
[1:05:09] Antichrist which is already crowned the
[1:05:12] Vicor of God by his worldly loving
[1:05:17] scientific bride all dressed up in palp
[1:05:22] of
[1:05:23] intellectual religious
[1:05:26] education she is made religious like him
[1:05:30] by his own interpretation of the word of
[1:05:34] God as he did Eve and his son
[1:05:40] Cain now that's pretty straightforward
[1:05:42] isn't it cuz anybody have any problem
[1:05:45] with
[1:05:46] that that's where we're
[1:05:49] at we're living in his Eden he is the
[1:05:53] God of this evil age that's what he
[1:05:56] wanted to uh uh obtain and we look at
[1:06:01] the things we've got you know just can
[1:06:04] you imagine a man sitting there and like
[1:06:06] he said he's in a horse and
[1:06:09] buggy and then well and then they came
[1:06:12] up and and and they developed a Springs
[1:06:16] and a carriages and and things like that
[1:06:19] and then he had the stage coach and oh
[1:06:21] that was even better you know what I
[1:06:23] mean and then one day they came up with
[1:06:25] the
[1:06:26] automobile and uh how would you like it
[1:06:29] if out here that if we all came to
[1:06:30] church this morning and carriages and
[1:06:34] horses there' be a little different
[1:06:37] Aroma around the place the deacons would
[1:06:41] have a whole another job that that they
[1:06:44] would do you know what I mean cleaning
[1:06:46] the parking lot and and so there'd be a
[1:06:49] lot of other things that would go on but
[1:06:52] we advanced
[1:06:56] right we Advanced and so we look back
[1:06:59] and we say wow we've come from this
[1:07:01] that's great this is great yeah you
[1:07:06] remember the good old
[1:07:08] days all these stories you know we my us
[1:07:11] kids we used to say to my mom and dad I
[1:07:14] know Mom you walked in the snow 50 miles
[1:07:17] to school yeah you know what I mean we
[1:07:20] lived in
[1:07:21] California you know and so it was always
[1:07:25] you don't remember you know and uh uh
[1:07:29] and it it's just that's the way it is we
[1:07:32] we look back and we see we've come
[1:07:33] forward we've come forward this is great
[1:07:36] and and we get caught up in
[1:07:38] that you understand we get caught up in
[1:07:41] all the new things and all the stuff
[1:07:44] that's offered us and and and and boy
[1:07:47] this is great uh you know uh we can fly
[1:07:51] instead of drive and that's that's great
[1:07:55] and and now of course we know that they
[1:07:57] they shot Rockets up and and by doing
[1:08:00] that they're able to put satellites up
[1:08:03] there and now you can take your phone I
[1:08:06] guess if you wanted to and go out in the
[1:08:08] parking lot and you could call your mom
[1:08:11] back home somewhere wherever she's at
[1:08:14] and you can see her and what is that
[1:08:17] that's
[1:08:18] great wow I like this this is
[1:08:23] wonderful and and people people just got
[1:08:26] everything they want I'm not against
[1:08:28] technology the technology in itself is
[1:08:32] just the education of what Satan had to
[1:08:35] offer
[1:08:37] amen but it's what that it's doing
[1:08:41] that's the
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:44] poison you understand it's
[1:08:47] satisfying the
[1:08:49] Hunger for More Of
[1:08:53] God it it it satisfies
[1:08:56] The Thirst and the hunger a and the
[1:08:59] desire for what does God have so Satan
[1:09:05] obviously he had he had what he wanted
[1:09:09] to
[1:09:10] achieve he wanted to achieve a
[1:09:13] scientific educational
[1:09:16] system a system where he could
[1:09:21] continually educate you and provide you
[1:09:25] you with science and knowledge and
[1:09:29] Technology he could always keep the
[1:09:31] carrot in front of you and and keep
[1:09:34] offering you better this and more
[1:09:36] Comfort this my goodness now you can go
[1:09:39] out and get a mattress that will just
[1:09:42] fit you so perfect that you just lay
[1:09:45] down you sleep
[1:09:49] forever everything pillows mattresses
[1:09:53] super blankets
[1:09:56] you know super this super that prophet
[1:09:59] of God yeah church let me tell you
[1:10:02] something a prophet's word is the
[1:10:04] Viewpoint of
[1:10:06] God that's right he's how God sees it
[1:10:10] that's what he's telling you he's
[1:10:12] telling you what God sees he comes up
[1:10:14] and preaches a message he says super
[1:10:16] sign everything's super super super
[1:10:22] improved
[1:10:24] yeah right
[1:10:26] everything's super everything's improved
[1:10:29] but what we've got to come to the
[1:10:31] realization of what's got to become a
[1:10:34] strike to us what's got to inspire us is
[1:10:37] that this is having an effect on your
[1:10:41] spiritual
[1:10:44] appetite it's
[1:10:48] suppressing the appetite for things of
[1:10:52] God that's true because they don't mix
[1:10:56] yes
[1:10:59] sir you have to give up one come
[1:11:04] on to obtain the
[1:11:08] other you can't you you you and that's
[1:11:11] what he said I I I would rather that you
[1:11:14] would give up one and take the other yes
[1:11:19] sir Lord but don't mix
[1:11:24] it and so this
[1:11:28] age that we're living in was prophesied
[1:11:33] to us
[1:11:36] amen we are we are realizing it more now
[1:11:42] of the things that our messenger that
[1:11:45] came and and you know with all my heart
[1:11:47] I believe that
[1:11:50] God promised that he would send this
[1:11:53] generation a prophetic message from
[1:11:57] above
[1:11:58] am that he was not going to let this
[1:12:02] church his elected children drift into
[1:12:06] the grips of the lady oan devil and be
[1:12:11] totally deceived and totally caught up
[1:12:16] at and their minds completely saturated
[1:12:21] with his lies and not do something
[1:12:24] that's right
[1:12:26] yeah that's right he wouldn't do
[1:12:29] it so he sent a voice amen and the voice
[1:12:34] began to prophesy
[1:12:38] yes that's what it did it begin to tell
[1:12:42] us this would happen this would happen
[1:12:46] as you all know that and I it it's
[1:12:49] everybody's been texting it back to one
[1:12:52] another and talking about it but the
[1:12:54] prophet of God has had a vision and he
[1:12:56] in this Vision he saw a great woman rise
[1:12:58] up in the United States he said it's
[1:13:00] either the Catholic Church a woman
[1:13:03] president or a woman vice
[1:13:06] president and by all accounts of how
[1:13:08] everything's going it appears that that
[1:13:11] will be
[1:13:15] fulfilled no you're actually seen
[1:13:20] something that was
[1:13:22] prophesied actually coming to pass pass
[1:13:26] but it comes to pass in such a
[1:13:28] climate in such confusion and such
[1:13:32] controversy and people taking sides I'll
[1:13:35] tell you a good message we all need to
[1:13:38] sink ourselves into is taking sides with
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:13:43] Jesus and and so here's the prophecy
[1:13:46] coming to pass but it's in such a
[1:13:50] political climate in such a
[1:13:53] controversial climate such again they're
[1:13:56] trying to tie all kinds of things to it
[1:13:58] race to it economy to it sickness to it
[1:14:02] all this stuff that we fail to see that
[1:14:07] we've just had thus sayith the Lord come
[1:14:10] to pass right in our eyes and we heard
[1:14:17] it but if he's taking the appetite
[1:14:22] away then that doesn't stimulate you you
[1:14:26] we become so stimulated by his
[1:14:30] technology and by his
[1:14:32] education and by his science and by by
[1:14:37] all the
[1:14:39] sensationalism that he offers the World
[1:14:41] by all the pleasure he offers the World
[1:14:44] by all these uh uh Ammon uh Ammon and
[1:14:49] technology and these games oh don't get
[1:14:53] caught up in games
[1:14:56] that's a whole five hour
[1:14:58] sermon right
[1:15:00] there and and so here the word of God
[1:15:05] comes to
[1:15:06] pass and
[1:15:09] it yeah that's what he said why did he
[1:15:14] say it why did he prophesy
[1:15:18] it what's the other side of the prophecy
[1:15:22] I don't want to be caught in between two
[1:15:26] prophecies how many think I I I I don't
[1:15:29] know someone was going to text it to me
[1:15:32] but I I forget what message it's in but
[1:15:37] brother M talks about he says you know
[1:15:39] they'll put on
[1:15:40] masks and they and it it won't do any
[1:15:45] good I wish I had that to read forgive
[1:15:49] me for not getting that but he just says
[1:15:51] it right out he says you watch are
[1:15:54] they're going to put on mask and they're
[1:15:55] going to try disease everywhere and it's
[1:15:58] not going to do any
[1:16:00] good it
[1:16:03] happens we're sitting there but does it
[1:16:07] does it
[1:16:08] strike the deep that ought to be calling
[1:16:12] for the
[1:16:15] Deep you understand is it hitting a spot
[1:16:19] inside us that should be
[1:16:23] resurrecting Within us the hunger for
[1:16:27] what is
[1:16:29] it why was this prophesied what's the
[1:16:32] other side of the prophecy he told us
[1:16:36] that perilous times would
[1:16:39] come he told us that men would be lovers
[1:16:42] of pleasure way back in the scripture
[1:16:45] and now our Prophet comes along he told
[1:16:47] us I mean remember when he said there'd
[1:16:50] be an egg-shaped
[1:16:52] car oh everybody thought the Volkswagen
[1:16:56] well the Volkswagen was an egg shaped
[1:16:59] car that ought have stimulated us wow
[1:17:03] that was fulfilled then he said he saw
[1:17:06] people sitting in a car playing games
[1:17:10] and the cars were driving
[1:17:16] themselves I've been in people's
[1:17:19] cars they pull up they press a button
[1:17:22] and the car Parks itself
[1:17:27] how many knows that got driverless
[1:17:30] technology what did that do to
[1:17:38] you did it throw you into your closet
[1:17:41] and say oh God prophecy's being
[1:17:45] fulfilled there this is there's prophecy
[1:17:48] going on this is exactly what what was
[1:17:53] told to me yeah
[1:17:57] but see Satan's always got his Eden
[1:18:02] Fanfare around it oh this is
[1:18:07] wonderful driving down the road you
[1:18:09] don't have to drive and we get caught up
[1:18:12] into his story line we get caught up
[1:18:15] into his what he's offering we get
[1:18:18] caught up into how good it is well how
[1:18:21] smart it is what a beautiful technology
[1:18:24] is but remember there's always something
[1:18:27] attached to it
[1:18:30] death and Jesus said don't worry about
[1:18:33] him that can destroy the body but worry
[1:18:36] about him who can destroy the soul look
[1:18:39] you you have a
[1:18:41] messenger that comes down and under
[1:18:46] inspiration you say did Brother benam
[1:18:48] know everything that he said I I know
[1:18:51] one thing I don't know that cuz I never
[1:18:53] sat and talked with him but I know he
[1:18:56] believed everything he
[1:18:58] said and that many times it was none
[1:19:02] other than God speaking right out
[1:19:05] through
[1:19:06] him and prophesying to us and telling us
[1:19:10] what lied ahead in other words the son
[1:19:13] of predition was totally revealed and
[1:19:17] the path that he was taking his world on
[1:19:21] was prophesied to us
[1:19:25] that he was taking this world down a
[1:19:29] scientific
[1:19:31] educational knowledge
[1:19:34] age and that's what he was going to lead
[1:19:37] them into where they put their trust in
[1:19:39] science and an education and instead of
[1:19:46] God but the best thing he can do is try
[1:19:49] to put something on us that suppresses
[1:19:56] even the
[1:19:58] need for
[1:20:05] God don't need
[1:20:10] them this is a just let
[1:20:13] me let me read this other thing to
[1:20:17] you I mean this is
[1:20:22] uh see if I can find it here real quick
[1:20:24] it's
[1:20:26] uh he says look at God will judge this
[1:20:30] nation someday with
[1:20:32] fire he'll sink it beneath the
[1:20:35] ocean the hour of his judgment is at
[1:20:38] hand the whole world will
[1:20:42] go religious
[1:20:45] perversion human
[1:20:48] perversion men don't even know what sex
[1:20:52] they belong to neither does
[1:20:58] women no that was a
[1:21:03] prophecy yes sir now I might as well
[1:21:08] just preach right we're just family here
[1:21:10] so now what they have today in the
[1:21:13] schools is what they call the gender
[1:21:22] unicorn let me tell you something
[1:21:25] you
[1:21:26] parents if you send your kids to public
[1:21:28] school you do not let them bring a
[1:21:31] textbook into your house without you
[1:21:33] looking at
[1:21:34] it you find out what they're teaching
[1:21:37] you ask your kids what did you learn
[1:21:41] today what today don't you get so lazy
[1:21:45] that you quit raising those
[1:21:52] kids the gender unicorn
[1:21:56] so they got this little
[1:21:58] unicorn there which is a lie in itself
[1:22:01] but
[1:22:05] anyway and they say okay you have the
[1:22:11] mind you have the
[1:22:14] heart and you have the
[1:22:17] natural and they said now what makes
[1:22:20] what you are is all three parts
[1:22:25] do you think like
[1:22:28] a boy or man or do you think like a
[1:22:34] woman that's
[1:22:36] one the second is do you
[1:22:40] feel and then the other is what your
[1:22:43] natural birth origin
[1:22:46] was but the natural birth origin is not
[1:22:50] what determines whether you're man or
[1:22:51] female it's whether all three of those
[1:22:57] wow they're teaching
[1:23:01] this they're teaching this the word of
[1:23:04] God says God made them male and
[1:23:09] female and they're looking right back up
[1:23:12] at him with Science Education
[1:23:17] psychology all this other scientific
[1:23:20] stuff and saying
[1:23:23] no we've created another
[1:23:26] one
[1:23:30] nonbinary that they can wait until
[1:23:32] they've know what's in their mind and
[1:23:35] their
[1:23:36] heart and then they can make whatever
[1:23:38] changes that they need to
[1:23:42] make what did he call it he called it
[1:23:46] human
[1:23:48] perversion you understand he said now
[1:23:51] this is
[1:23:53] prophecy it was prophesied that the
[1:23:56] world would get to a place where they
[1:23:58] would be so have such a human
[1:24:01] perversion that they couldn't
[1:24:04] discern whether they're man or
[1:24:12] woman I don't got a medical
[1:24:16] degree but I can tell the difference
[1:24:18] between a man and a
[1:24:22] woman that's right
[1:24:25] can you imagine how
[1:24:30] far but that isn't the problem the
[1:24:32] problem's not where they're at the
[1:24:35] problem is where what effect is where
[1:24:39] they are having on you is it making you
[1:24:50] lukewarm see you can get caught up on
[1:24:53] one side of the
[1:24:58] prophecy and then you're stuck between
[1:25:01] them there's there there's there's
[1:25:03] hundreds of these little things that
[1:25:06] brother
[1:25:07] brandom said to
[1:25:10] us that if you have ear to hear that
[1:25:13] they start clicking here's just another
[1:25:15] little one listen to this
[1:25:20] one he's talking about Alvis meaning
[1:25:22] Ricky and Ricky meaning cat he says you
[1:25:25] never heard such names as that in the
[1:25:28] Bible or in any other age it's the age
[1:25:32] names for this age there ever there ever
[1:25:38] was a perverted rats and cats it's
[1:25:43] there it's the these are the names for
[1:25:46] the
[1:25:48] age we never seen
[1:25:51] these like I said
[1:25:54] uh I'm just going to preach
[1:25:57] it he said you never seen names like
[1:26:01] that in the Bible but these are names
[1:26:06] for this age we got all kinds of names
[1:26:11] out there I don't want to even name them
[1:26:13] because uh there'll probably be somebody
[1:26:16] named that but all kinds of worldly
[1:26:20] names off of stars and and movie stars
[1:26:24] and athletes and people go to name
[1:26:29] books
[1:26:32] well I got a name
[1:26:39] book and they dig up all these names
[1:26:43] just because somebody else tells you it
[1:26:44] means
[1:26:46] something but he said there's
[1:26:48] names for this
[1:26:51] age but you see that that whole
[1:26:57] process of how important a name is it's
[1:27:01] slipped out of our
[1:27:04] thinking we don't pray
[1:27:06] over how what we're going to name our
[1:27:09] kids we don't think what effect will
[1:27:12] this name have on their
[1:27:16] life see it they accept any old
[1:27:21] name any old title any old name any old
[1:27:24] name you come up with is fine but he
[1:27:28] said there's names for this
[1:27:31] age and I don't know them
[1:27:34] all but I do have I do have a little
[1:27:37] guideline here that I think is so
[1:27:40] beautiful he said you never heard such
[1:27:44] names as that back in the
[1:27:49] Bible I like
[1:27:51] that I can't discern any
[1:27:55] name I can't to find out if you know if
[1:27:58] your name's rouille or or whatever it is
[1:28:02] that that's fine but I know one thing I
[1:28:05] got a prophet that said there's that you
[1:28:07] didn't find names like that in the Bible
[1:28:10] yeah well it gives me a good
[1:28:12] guideline and I don't know what your
[1:28:14] names are there's only one name I'm
[1:28:18] really important is and that's the name
[1:28:20] you have that's on the Lamb's Book of
[1:28:22] Life all this other name will go away
[1:28:25] but I'm just trying to point out to the
[1:28:27] fact that we get caught on one side of
[1:28:29] the
[1:28:32] prophecy everybody wants some sort of
[1:28:34] unique
[1:28:37] name everybody's trying to being so
[1:28:43] individual and they're missing the real
[1:28:46] individuality which is the individuality
[1:28:49] of your affair with Christ
[1:28:51] Jesus so he said look at that
[1:28:55] he says there ever was a perverted rats
[1:28:58] and cats at here all this million dooll
[1:29:02] disc
[1:29:03] jockeys there was no million dooll dis
[1:29:07] jockeys back then yeah but now there
[1:29:12] is they take a record and they
[1:29:16] go and and that's
[1:29:20] music well I finally figured out there's
[1:29:22] an instrument I can play
[1:29:24] a scratched
[1:29:28] record million dooll dish jockeys
[1:29:36] yeah and these kids walking out here
[1:29:40] can't even go to school without a thing
[1:29:44] sticking in the
[1:29:52] ear oh you found that
[1:29:58] but there it is here it is don't you see
[1:30:01] it prophecy fulfill what effect is it
[1:30:06] having on
[1:30:07] you remember this is the age that
[1:30:10] they'll become dull of
[1:30:12] hearing they it won't shake them nothing
[1:30:16] prophet of God said you could take he
[1:30:18] talk about that little baby in the store
[1:30:20] and her mama took it up and shook
[1:30:23] something in and began to scream and
[1:30:25] cry and he couldn't figure it
[1:30:29] out and that's what he said that's what
[1:30:31] happened to the
[1:30:33] church God's dangled every
[1:30:36] gift everything in front of their face
[1:30:38] and they won't move now we're seeing
[1:30:41] every prophecy everything that he's
[1:30:43] spoken coming to
[1:30:50] pass oh okay they want me to put that up
[1:30:53] there if you have it they got my mask
[1:30:56] quote to me see
[1:30:58] technology I mean I got to stop what I'm
[1:31:01] preaching and show you
[1:31:04] this anyway is it up there it is all
[1:31:07] right now some of them say well now if
[1:31:11] the plague Falls we'll just go in the
[1:31:15] hospital if the plague happens to fall
[1:31:19] you know what I'll
[1:31:20] do we'll go get Dr Jones
[1:31:24] he'll know how to take care of it it
[1:31:27] didn't work yet they were smart well if
[1:31:32] the plague Falls we'll just go down
[1:31:34] beneath the ground in a cave and shut
[1:31:37] the door down it won't do it one bit of
[1:31:40] good we'll stay in the house and put a
[1:31:43] mask over our face and put some
[1:31:47] disinfectant on it didn't do a bit of
[1:31:52] good my goodness thus saith the
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:32:03] Lord I
[1:32:06] mean God made a provided way yes and
[1:32:11] what was what the blood God provided it
[1:32:15] as as simple as it
[1:32:20] seems to take the blood of the lamb and
[1:32:24] sprinkle the post yet God said that was
[1:32:27] his way and he honored it all out from
[1:32:32] under the blood
[1:32:39] die so we
[1:32:43] see the
[1:32:46] prophecy all these things have come to
[1:32:50] pass and and there there's just there's
[1:32:53] more of them uh but let's just take a
[1:32:57] second if we
[1:33:00] could so we understand that here's the
[1:33:04] prophecy that was given about Satan's
[1:33:11] zeden and the God of this evil age so a
[1:33:15] prophet comes on the scene and he says
[1:33:19] do you see the
[1:33:20] scheme do you see it
[1:33:24] he says this is what he's doing he's
[1:33:26] building a system he's building a
[1:33:28] kingdom he's building an Eden thank you
[1:33:31] Lord God more scientific more beautiful
[1:33:35] than than Michael's Kingdom and he's
[1:33:37] telling us what he's doing what he's
[1:33:39] doing and then he starts throwing in
[1:33:41] these things that'll happen they won't
[1:33:44] know whether they're a man or woman they
[1:33:46] they they'll have plagues fall and
[1:33:47] they'll put on mask they'll do this and
[1:33:50] they'll do that and they'll walk around
[1:33:52] with a thing in their ear
[1:33:57] why you know could you imagine someone
[1:33:59] coming up from 50 years ago you walk
[1:34:02] into the store and people are walking
[1:34:03] around talking there's nobody
[1:34:06] there you want to go lay hands on
[1:34:08] everybody you think they all escape from
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:12] institution but they all got something
[1:34:14] in their
[1:34:18] ear a blue tooth
[1:34:24] well I know what color blue belongs
[1:34:29] to you better go research that yourself
[1:34:32] I I like blue but that I'm just
[1:34:36] saying so we see this
[1:34:39] side okay but it's it's so watered down
[1:34:46] because how does
[1:34:48] Satan
[1:34:50] appear as an angel of Light look what
[1:34:54] I've got for you
[1:34:59] today oh yeah pretty soon they'll say
[1:35:03] you want to know where your kid is let's
[1:35:05] put the chip in
[1:35:07] them they already know where you are by
[1:35:09] your cell
[1:35:11] phone that's how they determine traffic
[1:35:13] how many cell phones are all stacked
[1:35:17] up that's why if you look for something
[1:35:20] you know like I you know I thought I was
[1:35:22] going to order something for my wife on
[1:35:24] the internet you know what I mean got to
[1:35:26] try this shopping at home day well the
[1:35:29] ad shows up on her
[1:35:34] computer why am I getting ads for dish
[1:35:37] towels all of a sudden or something like
[1:35:39] that I don't
[1:35:49] know spiritual
[1:35:52] amnesia lulling us to sleep don't have
[1:35:56] to be on fire for God what are we
[1:36:03] anticipating don't buy 5G cuz 6G will be
[1:36:06] out next
[1:36:10] week I want it to sink
[1:36:14] in I'm watching this virus kill the
[1:36:21] church binding people in fear
[1:36:25] people go to work but they're afraid to
[1:36:27] come to church cuz this is where they're
[1:36:29] going to get it since when do Satan
[1:36:32] convinced everybody that the church was
[1:36:34] the place you were getting sick you get
[1:36:37] sick out in the
[1:36:41] world but if we're not a Spirit-filled
[1:36:43] church and we're not hungering for God
[1:36:46] and we're not praying for one another
[1:36:49] and we're lukewarm and we're backslid
[1:36:51] and we're taking everything that Satan
[1:36:54] has to give us and the church becomes
[1:36:56] powerless then you ought to be afraid of
[1:36:59] that
[1:37:00] church that's the church you ought to be
[1:37:02] afraid of but that's the church you
[1:37:05] ought to
[1:37:14] change that's what's
[1:37:17] happening I sat with the man the other
[1:37:19] day the man that rent us the facility
[1:37:23] for for the young peoples get together
[1:37:26] he said we have to sell this
[1:37:27] building they said well that's too bad
[1:37:30] this is beautiful he says yeah we can't
[1:37:32] keep it
[1:37:37] anymore and I felt for him because I
[1:37:40] know what he's going through our
[1:37:41] offerings are down
[1:37:43] 2third we take in a third of the money
[1:37:46] that we used
[1:37:48] to you know out of
[1:37:51] sight out of mind
[1:37:57] you know you never should come to church
[1:37:59] and all of a sudden decide you give
[1:38:00] because the offering baskets in front of
[1:38:05] you you want to be
[1:38:08] blessed don't Rob
[1:38:11] god with tithes and
[1:38:13] offerings set it aside if it's a dollar
[1:38:17] say Lord this is the dollar I'm
[1:38:21] giv amen you know but but what what I'm
[1:38:26] saying is is this is having an effect
[1:38:28] but let's just stop there and let's talk
[1:38:32] about the other
[1:38:36] prophecy because we don't want to be
[1:38:38] caught in
[1:38:40] between these two
[1:38:44] prophecies and so let's let's just take
[1:38:46] a a quick second and we'll talk about
[1:38:50] those things sorry if I got off on a few
[1:38:54] soap
[1:38:56] boxes
[1:38:58] but this is
[1:39:02] from the
[1:39:07] Masterpiece
[1:39:09] and so I'd like to
[1:39:16] uh read this to
[1:39:19] you now so we have this other side and
[1:39:24] so we we see what Satan's trying to
[1:39:27] achieve right so he's trying to achieve
[1:39:30] to get the world in the place where he
[1:39:32] can come up with his one world
[1:39:37] head you know somebody that can bring
[1:39:40] the world
[1:39:41] together and now the Lord has something
[1:39:44] that he's trying to do cuz Satan started
[1:39:48] his Eden in
[1:39:51] Eden didn't he
[1:39:54] he went and got Adam's bride to take him
[1:39:59] as her
[1:40:01] husband before
[1:40:05] Adam you see that right that's what he
[1:40:09] did he got to her
[1:40:12] first and offered his tree of knowledge
[1:40:16] and she took
[1:40:18] it cuz he was going to build a bigger
[1:40:22] better Kingdom
[1:40:24] than Michael had so he got to her
[1:40:28] first and and in doing so he he
[1:40:33] destroyed it and this what he said now
[1:40:36] notice this
[1:40:39] masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it
[1:40:42] the deceiver broke through the walls and
[1:40:46] he marred this masterpiece now this
[1:40:49] masterpiece was Adam and Eve in the
[1:40:52] garden
[1:40:54] that was God's Masterpiece family you
[1:40:58] understand that you Bible
[1:41:01] readers and he and he marred this
[1:41:05] masterpiece because
[1:41:08] that because that's paragraph 55 of the
[1:41:12] Masterpiece if you can put it up there
[1:41:14] because I know I'm not a very good page
[1:41:17] paragraph 55 page 11 of the
[1:41:20] Masterpiece because that the way he did
[1:41:24] it how did he do
[1:41:27] it I'll go more into detail of it how he
[1:41:31] done it this was the Masterpiece was
[1:41:35] walled by the word by the word God's
[1:41:39] word and the Masterpiece itself of the
[1:41:42] family was fortified by this
[1:41:46] word
[1:41:48] but but the broken part that was broken
[1:41:52] off of of the original went out beyond
[1:41:55] that
[1:41:56] wall it gives Satan a chance to Mar it
[1:42:01] and now as you know what I believe on
[1:42:04] those things so I won't have time to say
[1:42:07] that but the Masterpiece was broken he's
[1:42:10] referring to serpent
[1:42:12] se but the great
[1:42:15] sculpture when he seen the fall of his
[1:42:20] family the masterpiece
[1:42:23] he wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[1:42:27] there face down and
[1:42:31] ruin he went to work
[1:42:34] immediately to build it up again he
[1:42:38] wasn't willing that it should perish lay
[1:42:42] there like that all the time because he
[1:42:46] is God and he will not be defeated
[1:42:53] so he went to work immediately and began
[1:42:57] to build again unto his own image
[1:43:02] amen
[1:43:05] am amen so now we know what what
[1:43:11] God's achievement was amen Satan was
[1:43:14] building his own Eden where he would be
[1:43:17] the God God's on this side and he says
[1:43:20] I'm going to restore my family am
[1:43:24] if you go back and listen and just look
[1:43:26] it up the prophet of God's continually
[1:43:29] telling us back to Eden Back to Eden
[1:43:34] we're going back to Eden you understand
[1:43:37] he always was telling us you come from
[1:43:40] somewhere we're going back redeemed
[1:43:44] means to bring back again he keeps
[1:43:46] telling us you're a people that are not
[1:43:50] part of Satan's evened you're a people
[1:43:53] that aren't part of this evil age you're
[1:43:57] elected you're selected you're
[1:44:01] chosen don't get caught between the two
[1:44:07] prophecies there's another
[1:44:10] prophecy
[1:44:12] right again in the
[1:44:15] Masterpiece paragraph 156
[1:44:23] do you have
[1:44:26] that why why must the bridegroom be the
[1:44:30] word manifest made plain it's because
[1:44:34] the bride and the bridegroom are one
[1:44:38] right she is just smitten piece off of
[1:44:43] him there's the Masterpiece it was
[1:44:46] smitten yes sir
[1:44:49] Michelangelo could not reproduce that
[1:44:52] again
[1:44:53] he could not put it back but God is
[1:44:57] going to do it amen he's going to bring
[1:45:02] this little bride that's smitten right
[1:45:06] back to the side of the original
[1:45:10] word and there he is there's the
[1:45:14] Masterpiece the family back again in the
[1:45:18] Garden of Eden
[1:45:24] wonderful so there's another achievement
[1:45:27] yes
[1:45:28] sir right you don't want to get stuck in
[1:45:31] between the two achievements
[1:45:34] sir so there's something that God wants
[1:45:37] to achieve yes sir and he's inviting
[1:45:42] you to get in his program yes sir and to
[1:45:47] do what's
[1:45:49] necessary which by the way is selling
[1:45:52] out
[1:45:57] in order to be a part of what he's
[1:46:01] achieving now he's already prophesied
[1:46:03] and said I'm going to destroy this other
[1:46:09] Eden
[1:46:11] so enter into the ark get on
[1:46:17] board how is this bride going to do this
[1:46:21] how is the wheat going to do this
[1:46:24] Malachi 4 said in the last days it would
[1:46:28] be restored back restored back like the
[1:46:32] beginning take it back I will restore
[1:46:37] saith the Lord all the years the
[1:46:40] palmerworm and the cankerworm and all
[1:46:43] these other things have eaten I will
[1:46:46] restore again Malachi 4 said he will
[1:46:51] restore the hearts
[1:46:53] of the people and the faith of the
[1:46:58] people back to the original fathers
[1:47:01] again see we see this right before us
[1:47:05] Church where are we at
[1:47:09] amen right okay so now we we what he's
[1:47:13] what he's told us and through many other
[1:47:16] prophecies could been prophesied what
[1:47:20] this Satan's Eden would do and we're
[1:47:23] sitting
[1:47:24] back and we're seeing
[1:47:27] it and I see it I read it I see it and I
[1:47:31] still am amazed I
[1:47:34] Marvel how can man get any more
[1:47:40] crazy they kill babies
[1:47:46] now they're setting the stage for
[1:47:49] euphanasia right
[1:47:53] we we we can't even comprehend we can't
[1:47:56] comprehend the mass murder of millions
[1:48:01] of Jews I recommend you all to go to the
[1:48:04] Holocaust Museum in
[1:48:10] Dallas and
[1:48:13] watch how Hitler educated the people
[1:48:17] against the
[1:48:21] Jews he blam blame them for
[1:48:25] sickness did you know that cuz they
[1:48:28] didn't get sick because they
[1:48:34] washed they did they washed their
[1:48:37] food okay he blamed them for their
[1:48:41] economics because they didn't do
[1:48:44] business with uncer
[1:48:47] things they didn't buy
[1:48:50] meat from an uncer
[1:48:55] butcher they didn't buy things like pigs
[1:48:59] and and things like
[1:49:02] that they followed the
[1:49:04] law and the word of the law preserved
[1:49:09] them by
[1:49:12] itself they married in their own
[1:49:15] ranks so they knew their family history
[1:49:18] they they they weren't marrying boys
[1:49:21] that didn't have a good background
[1:49:23] nobody knew their parents all kinds of
[1:49:26] stuff come in they were accountable to
[1:49:28] one
[1:49:31] another and Hitler just began to go out
[1:49:33] and lay these things out there and lay
[1:49:35] these things out there and he began to
[1:49:38] teach them these are the cause of this
[1:49:41] these are the cause of our economical
[1:49:43] problem look at how they all
[1:49:47] Prosper you know why they seem to
[1:49:49] prosper they were content
[1:49:54] they were content with what they had
[1:49:56] they gave glory to God they separated
[1:49:59] themselves because they were a separated
[1:50:01] people they became easy to
[1:50:04] blame how separated are
[1:50:11] we and he convinced
[1:50:14] them you know Canada just shut down
[1:50:19] Thursday I talked to my friend Danny far
[1:50:22] uh brother brother Danson up there good
[1:50:24] brother brother uh Ezekiel and Andre's
[1:50:27] brother brother VI's son was wanting to
[1:50:29] get
[1:50:30] married
[1:50:33] sorry can't get married can't come
[1:50:38] together so I said well how are they
[1:50:40] doing that how do they enforce it he
[1:50:42] says what they've done is they've turned
[1:50:44] all the ambulance drivers all the fire
[1:50:47] people all the social workers they've
[1:50:50] deputized them all
[1:50:54] and they have a snitch
[1:51:00] line so if you have a
[1:51:04] meeting they call the snitch line and
[1:51:08] then one of these deputized people come
[1:51:11] out and they write you a
[1:51:16] citation there are people up there that
[1:51:19] have
[1:51:20] come from country R like that and
[1:51:24] they're saying this is what happened to
[1:51:26] us in
[1:51:28] Germany this is what happened to us in
[1:51:31] Cuba this is what happened to us in
[1:51:33] Venezuela this is what happened this is
[1:51:36] what's happening to us
[1:51:37] now it's
[1:51:41] happening can you believe
[1:51:46] that the mall's open but Church
[1:51:50] ain't the gas station is open but you
[1:51:53] can't get a spiritual fill
[1:52:00] up so so we we see it yes sir we see
[1:52:07] that great thing that's unfolding how
[1:52:10] how that he just brought that in there
[1:52:14] but now we we look and we see that that
[1:52:18] this great
[1:52:20] uh masterpiece
[1:52:25] he said now a
[1:52:27] sculpture wouldn't make a Great
[1:52:30] Masterpiece and then take it and set it
[1:52:34] in an alley somewhere or hide it behind
[1:52:40] buildings as our Lord told us a man
[1:52:44] doesn't light a candle and put it under
[1:52:47] a bushel when we become God's
[1:52:50] Masterpiece we are not hid in the alley
[1:52:54] somewhere we must give
[1:52:59] [Music]
[1:53:03] light but
[1:53:05] God in the spiritual achievement is
[1:53:09] going forward not going back he's going
[1:53:13] forward looking into the word and
[1:53:17] believing the promises for things that
[1:53:21] never has come yet right that is in
[1:53:26] countdown paragraph
[1:53:30] 37 now so God's achievement and his
[1:53:35] people are looking forward Amen to
[1:53:40] things that's promised in the word that
[1:53:43] we haven't seen yet so we know and
[1:53:47] there's quote after quote that I could
[1:53:50] read you this morning but I'll hurry now
[1:53:53] is that there's promises or prophecies
[1:53:57] made of the restoration and of the Bride
[1:54:02] coming and doing the works that he said
[1:54:06] that we would
[1:54:09] do he told us of these things he says
[1:54:13] for they're looking for the spiritual
[1:54:17] Revelation to manifest the spiritual
[1:54:21] things that God has
[1:54:27] promised so that's that hunger I'm
[1:54:30] talking
[1:54:31] about if we see this side of the
[1:54:33] prophecy we see everything he said about
[1:54:36] the world coming to pass the science the
[1:54:38] education the knowledge people walking
[1:54:41] around with things sticking out of their
[1:54:43] ear not knowing where their men or woman
[1:54:45] seeing the vice president come in
[1:54:47] wearing masks
[1:54:54] wow now there's the other side of the
[1:54:58] prophecy of people that are hungering
[1:55:01] thirsting after righteousness uh a
[1:55:04] people that know that God's got
[1:55:06] something for they're looking for the
[1:55:08] things the promises that haven't been
[1:55:11] manifested yet they're looking for that
[1:55:14] life that's in Christ just the way it
[1:55:17] should be but now friends may I say this
[1:55:21] it has come to the age of the
[1:55:25] astronaut I think Billy might have read
[1:55:27] this for us we have moved out of the
[1:55:31] airplane age we've got more power now
[1:55:36] the astronaut age has come in what is it
[1:55:40] we've come into a spiritual age of
[1:55:44] astronauts see going above
[1:55:52] it's the same Spirit only more
[1:55:56] power only lifted
[1:56:00] higher can go higher see more see
[1:56:07] more how many have had your spiritual
[1:56:12] isab I counsel the to buy of me IAD that
[1:56:17] I mayest see there's coming a time where
[1:56:21] the church will see any
[1:56:24] more you see
[1:56:27] that yeah that's one side of the
[1:56:30] prophecy but do you see the other
[1:56:33] side have you prayed for the
[1:56:36] Revelation that opens your eyes to see
[1:56:40] what God Said don't get caught between
[1:56:42] the two prophecies yes
[1:56:47] sir see
[1:56:50] more believe more
[1:56:53] be more like
[1:56:58] Christ not the
[1:57:00] Ile not the horse and buggy not even the
[1:57:04] airplane but the astronaut he
[1:57:07] sweeps on and above to each
[1:57:11] one it's called The Eagle age in the
[1:57:15] Bible God calls His prophets Eagle AGS
[1:57:19] we realize over in the Bible we find it
[1:57:22] Malachi 4 that were promised that in the
[1:57:26] last days now he's like His prophets to
[1:57:30] be Eagles he calls them Eagles he's the
[1:57:33] great Jehovah Eagle he he is able to
[1:57:38] achieve to himself a
[1:57:42] bride
[1:57:45] amen he is going to in the last
[1:57:50] days be able to get a
[1:57:54] bride that with a
[1:57:57] ministry that's so
[1:58:00] exactly like a man and his wife becoming
[1:58:06] one he's going to get this Pride with
[1:58:09] the ministry now I want to say
[1:58:13] this I'm just going to look for the
[1:58:16] words brother Brandon was the first
[1:58:20] fruits that's right you understand all
[1:58:24] he didn't leave all these prophecies
[1:58:27] just concerning
[1:58:29] himself that's
[1:58:32] right in other words he brought these
[1:58:36] prophecies because they concerned
[1:58:40] you he was the elaser call he was the
[1:58:44] one that was sent to bring a bride he
[1:58:46] even makes that statement I I've been
[1:58:49] sent to bring a in Chase to him a Chase
[1:58:52] virgin to present to him a chased virgin
[1:58:56] that's
[1:58:58] right so he's looking for a he said that
[1:59:02] with the ministry that's so exactly like
[1:59:05] a man and his wife becoming one and when
[1:59:08] Jehovah gets his people like him then he
[1:59:12] lives in his people they are one amen
[1:59:17] now this is the other side yes sir right
[1:59:21] of the prophecy
[1:59:22] amen the other side of the prophecy that
[1:59:25] there's things we haven't seen yet
[1:59:28] higher Heights that we can go to to be
[1:59:31] more like
[1:59:37] Christ course he don't want you to have
[1:59:39] that come on boy every time you head
[1:59:42] that way he says let me I got something
[1:59:44] new for you have you seen
[1:59:47] this wow all of a sudden you qualify for
[1:59:50] a loan you can't afford
[1:59:56] I'll lend you

[2:00:30] give you what house can I give you what
[2:00:33] can I give you for your
[2:00:35] time let me buy your
[2:00:45] time and we read that last week how they
[2:00:48] spend so much money on cosmetics
[2:00:52] 998 billion
[2:00:56] dollar to be something you're
[2:01:01] not I mean I I I don't
[2:01:05] even I don't even know how to preach
[2:01:07] against it it's so
[2:01:09] crazy and and so he's buying our
[2:01:14] time and then here's this other
[2:01:18] prophecy that's prophesied and he's
[2:01:21] saying what this bride does is she
[2:01:24] starts hungering and
[2:01:28] thirsting after righteousness amen
[2:01:31] that's right
[2:01:33] now to be more Christlike what time is
[2:01:41] it
[2:01:43] so if you're going to
[2:01:47] be what Christlike then you have to be
[2:01:51] what what he
[2:01:54] preached is that right now just go back
[2:01:58] with me a
[2:01:59] moment and so you sit back in a moment
[2:02:03] AR good just think all the people that
[2:02:04] are at home they can just go get the
[2:02:06] refrigerator and get something they can
[2:02:08] get up and go to the bathroom and they
[2:02:09] don't have to go through this and you
[2:02:12] have to
[2:02:16] suffer but can you imagine come on
[2:02:19] preacher he shows up on the scene
[2:02:22] and he begins to
[2:02:25] preach and and so and he he finally he
[2:02:30] gets to he gets to Matthew in the Book
[2:02:33] of Matthew and he gets on the sermon of
[2:02:35] the
[2:02:37] mount and he says you have heard that
[2:02:41] was said by them of old
[2:02:45] times and then he starts to preach and
[2:02:48] then over in the 27th verse he says you
[2:02:51] have heard heard that it was said by
[2:02:54] them of old
[2:02:56] times and then he comes down farther and
[2:02:59] he says again in the 33rd verse you have
[2:03:03] heard that it hath been said by them of
[2:03:08] old
[2:03:09] time can you imagine him beginning to
[2:03:13] preach that there was a new
[2:03:17] life there was a new expectation
[2:03:21] there was a new
[2:03:24] power there was a new
[2:03:27] fulfillment that was
[2:03:31] coming that it wasn't something that
[2:03:34] they ever had
[2:03:37] before that they were going to Exodus
[2:03:41] out of the law that they were
[2:03:45] under into a Spirit-filled
[2:03:49] experience and a union with
[2:03:53] God where they were GNA go wait in an
[2:03:56] upper room and be endued with power from
[2:03:59] on high and the works that I do shall
[2:04:03] you do
[2:04:05] also now let me tell you something
[2:04:07] that's what the prophet of
[2:04:09] God taught the
[2:04:14] church you couldn't be what he was a
[2:04:17] prophet you couldn't open the seals cuz
[2:04:20] the word of God comes to to a prophet
[2:04:23] but the prophecy pertaining to you he
[2:04:31] gave he tore both sides of the prophecy
[2:04:35] he prophesied what the bride would be he
[2:04:38] prophesied what power she would have he
[2:04:41] prophesied that she'd be lifted up in
[2:04:45] the higher grounds he prophesied if that
[2:04:48] she would knock and open I will come in
[2:04:52] and sck with them and I'll eat the
[2:04:54] evening meal so there's another side of
[2:04:58] the
[2:05:01] prophecy that's been prophesied about a
[2:05:04] people that sits down with him and eats
[2:05:09] the spiritual
[2:05:11] Revelation that is going to produce in
[2:05:14] her the
[2:05:16] faith to do the same works that he did
[2:05:21] and not just the Miracle Works the
[2:05:24] Miracle Works of blessed art The
[2:05:26] Peacemaker for they shall be called the
[2:05:28] children of God blessed are them that
[2:05:30] hunger and thirst after righteousness

[2:05:34] filled
[2:05:36] amen blessed are them who visit the
[2:05:39] father and the widows in their
[2:05:42] Affliction the whole other teaching that
[2:05:45] the Lord Jesus Christ taught of the life
[2:05:48] of God manifested in a people
[2:05:52] that have become so
[2:05:54] Christlike that they're a Shining
[2:05:58] Light that's
[2:06:02] prophesied that's the other
[2:06:06] prophecy somebody that is is
[2:06:10] uh is
[2:06:12] so spiritually in tune with god brother
[2:06:16] Bram says that she doesn't even
[2:06:18] wink at the other side you know he said
[2:06:22] a woman should never even wink at a
[2:06:24] man carry a
[2:06:26] conversation have any emotion at
[2:06:31] all with someone that's not your
[2:06:37] husband
[2:06:39] none God of this evil age I'll just give
[2:06:41] you the paragraph you go you go home
[2:06:45] and
[2:06:47] and and read it I don't know I had my
[2:06:49] book up here I just no this is a I I
[2:06:52] need to say this just so I
[2:06:55] can I can just have you go find it if
[2:06:58] you would because it's very important
[2:07:02] that's
[2:07:09] right he says how can the bride of
[2:07:12] Christ associate in a
[2:07:15] denomination when one is disobedient and
[2:07:18] the other
[2:07:19] obedient this is paragraph 1 1 36 God of
[2:07:22] this evil
[2:07:25] age when one is disobedient the other
[2:07:28] obedient how can one be the word and the
[2:07:32] other one pervert the
[2:07:35] word how can
[2:07:37] a how can a a a prostitute and a clean
[2:07:42] woman walk together in a griev agreement
[2:07:46] they can't do it and then uh see if I
[2:07:50] can find
[2:07:52] okay and then now this is paragraph
[2:07:59] 162 now look if a woman goes out here
[2:08:03] and is married to a man and she goes out
[2:08:07] and makes love with another man and has
[2:08:10] an affair with him and comes back to her
[2:08:13] husband he should kick her out is that
[2:08:16] right she must be true to him because
[2:08:19] she is vowed to him and the bride of
[2:08:22] Christ is vowed to Christ This is a
[2:08:26] prophecy this is the other side of the
[2:08:29] prophecy this is telling what this bride
[2:08:32] will be like how she'll be how she'll be
[2:08:36] identified for the
[2:08:40] Rapture she is vowed to Christ and he is
[2:08:43] the word not even wink at the other side
[2:08:49] a woman should not even wink at another
[2:08:53] man she should make no signs no emotions
[2:08:58] at all towards him for she is absolutely
[2:09:03] a bride to a
[2:09:08] bridegroom we don't want none of your
[2:09:10] mix tree your denominations be true to
[2:09:14] Christ the word he'll vindicate it to be
[2:09:17] true no sir not even an motion of
[2:09:22] anything towards making love to him not
[2:09:26] joining his ranks or anything else or
[2:09:29] let him get you in his arms or in his
[2:09:34] care you talk or talk to you over this
[2:09:38] way that
[2:09:40] way I'll tell you I've seen a lot of our
[2:09:43] young people get caught up in all this
[2:09:45] political stuff that's out
[2:09:48] there forming opinions
[2:09:52] about people poison let me warn you as
[2:09:56] somebody who loves you there's neither
[2:09:59] Bond nor free Jew nor Greek male nor
[2:10:03] female we are all Christ and Christ is
[2:10:07] God God is not a respector of persons
[2:10:11] and I don't care how ugly the world gets
[2:10:14] to
[2:10:18] you it don't matter
[2:10:21] eternal life what the prophecy of this
[2:10:26] bride is is what should be mattering to
[2:10:29] us how do we fulfill the prophecy that's
[2:10:34] spoken of what this bride will
[2:10:39] be what he said she would be every
[2:10:43] single one of us should be concentrating
[2:10:46] on our life look what he says he says
[2:10:50] emotion
[2:10:51] make love to him this way you only you
[2:10:56] listen only to one voice my sheep know
[2:11:00] my voice a stranger what is this voice
[2:11:04] any man's voice is his word and this is
[2:11:08] it the Bible not one word to be added to
[2:11:11] it or taken from it just stay right with
[2:11:16] that voice a stranger they won't follow
[2:11:22] amen there's a
[2:11:26] prophecy concerning
[2:11:29] us what we will
[2:11:33] be the messenger described to us what
[2:11:37] she would be she would be endued with
[2:11:40] power from on high the faith would re be
[2:11:44] restored back to her she would follow
[2:11:46] the teachings of the word of God she
[2:11:50] would be Christian
[2:11:52] her light would be
[2:11:54] shining she would be about the father's
[2:12:01] business she would
[2:12:03] be she would be uh doing the things that
[2:12:08] he said she'd be
[2:12:11] fighting the other
[2:12:14] Kingdom she'd be
[2:12:18] finding seeking for last Souls
[2:12:21] and she would be
[2:12:24] filling getting people filled with the
[2:12:27] Holy
[2:12:29] Ghost she would she would be fighting
[2:12:32] finding and
[2:12:35] filling she would be about the father's
[2:12:38] business she would be adopted she'd be
[2:12:41] fulfilling the prophecy she would be
[2:12:43] free from the world so he has his
[2:12:49] achievement now like the close with
[2:12:53] this and now when the Brethren received
[2:12:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost they say
[2:13:01] this is the summit this is all of
[2:13:05] it but Brethren that's
[2:13:09] wrong there is no Summit to God's
[2:13:13] power we move on and on and on right
[2:13:18] it's the unlimited resource of God has
[2:13:22] never been tapped
[2:13:24] yet blessings and powers that we know
[2:13:28] nothing about it's never been even
[2:13:33] revealed to
[2:13:35] archangels is laying just ahead for the
[2:13:40] church that will
[2:13:43] believe for ith not seen or ear not
[2:13:47] heard neither has it entered into the
[2:13:50] hearts of men in what God has prepar has
[2:13:54] for them in store that love him so let's

[2:14:50] with that to organize
[2:14:53] ourselves and get into a place where

[2:16:13] more of God that's what it don't let it

[2:17:55] something in
[2:17:57] here that
[2:18:00] calls there's a deep that calls to a
[2:18:03] deep and if there's a deep that calls to
[2:18:06] a deep then there's got to be a deep to
[2:18:10] respond if the prophet prophesied of a
[2:18:15] bride
[2:18:17] Victorious and he said he is going to
[2:18:20] have a bride
[2:18:21] he is going to separate a bride I want
[2:18:25] to be a part of that prophecy I don't
[2:18:29] want to get stuck between the two
[2:18:32] prophecies between the two kingdoms no

[2:18:38] masters I want to sell out to the

[2:19:38] inside he judges the spirit of a man he
[2:19:42] judges the inner
[2:19:43] man God judges is what you're hungry
[2:19:49] for he judges what you long for that's
[2:19:53] why he said all ye that are
[2:19:55] hungry all ye that are burdened in heavy

[2:20:26] difficult to be a
[2:20:31] Christian so controversy to let your
[2:20:34] light
[2:20:36] shine that it's just easier to slip it

[2:21:00] in an
[2:21:03] alley he said we must let our light
[2:21:09] shine and if you'd ask yourself and I'd
[2:21:12] ask myself this morning what light are
[2:21:14] we
[2:21:18] shining what prophecy are
[2:21:21] is our life light shining
[2:21:28] on what
[2:21:31] path are we

[2:22:43] raise up a people and feel them full of
[2:22:46] power and the Holy Ghost

[2:22:52] and raptured
[2:22:55] out and I've sat here in the
[2:22:58] middle caught between the two
