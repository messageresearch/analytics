[0:00] and give who she was and something about
[0:03] to the Lord's blessings upon her
[0:07] something other in Finnish language I
[0:10] don't even know English
[0:13] let alone finish so it goes to show that
[0:17] God speaks in all the languages and all
[0:21] human beings belong to him how wonderful
[0:25] he is doing the exceedingly abundantly I
[0:32] do not wish to take too much the time
[0:35] but just while this is all my mind I
[0:38] remember some time ago at the Sam
[0:43] Houston Coliseum and down in Houston
[0:46] Texas and we were trying to had such an
[0:51] overflow crowd - we were trying to take
[0:54] care of part of them at the Coliseum and
[0:56] part over to raymond riches now I'm sure
[1:00] that the Angeles temple knows who
[1:02] Raymond Richie is he was a personal
[1:05] friend to the founder of this church and
[1:08] I would pray over here for our prayer
[1:11] line and then go over to the Coliseum
[1:13] and praying and one night when my
[1:15] brother was taking me from the prayer
[1:18] line I heard a little Spanish girl
[1:21] weeping and she would have been the next
[1:26] in line according to the numbers of the
[1:28] prayer cards I was calling and she
[1:31] wasn't nothing but a child of 15 years
[1:34] old something well my brother started
[1:38] pushing me on and the man that was
[1:40] supposed to take me but somehow
[1:44] something told me see that child
[1:48] I said I'll bring her here and they
[1:51] brought her over and she gave her prayer
[1:52] card to the man and so she came over and
[1:56] I began to speak to her and and she just
[2:00] stood there I thought she might be deaf
[2:02] and dumb but find out she couldn't speak
[2:07] English she could not understand one
[2:11] of English and so I asked that there was
[2:14] an interpreter and they got a man and
[2:17] brought him up for the interpretation
[2:20] well I asked her a few questions and she
[2:24] began answering me through the
[2:26] interpreter and then all of a sudden the
[2:29] vision come and I said I see before me a
[2:34] little girl with little plaited hair
[2:37] hanging down her back she's sitting by
[2:41] an old fireplace eating yellow corn from
[2:46] a cob that's being took from a kid all
[2:49] of which hangs over the fireplace and
[2:51] she's eaten too much of it
[2:53] she falls violently ill and she's taken
[2:57] to the bed by her mother and throwed in
[3:01] to epilepsy and then the vision left and
[3:05] the little girl turned to the
[3:08] interpreter and said in Spanish I
[3:11] thought he couldn't speak Spanish
[3:15] and the interpreter said you spoke
[3:19] English did you not brother branham I
[3:21] said I did he said well she said you
[3:23] spoke Spanish I said stop the recorders
[3:27] all along the road and they stopped and
[3:30] we played it back and every word was
[3:32] English and then we had her to repeat
[3:35] what I said and as long as the vision
[3:40] was going on she heard every word in
[3:42] English why here how here we ever man in
[3:48] our own tongue wherein we were born God
[3:51] is still God now when I begin to save
[3:56] words within myself she didn't
[3:59] understand that at all but the Holy
[4:01] Spirit speaking English was interpreted
[4:04] to her in Spanish God is a good God is
[4:10] or Robert's places him certainly is true
[4:14] and if we could only grasp that this
[4:19] afternoon that his goodness so that
[4:22] little
[4:23] finish or whatever she was last night to
[4:26] be sure that her faith would be
[4:29] recognized
[4:30] he called her in her own language
[4:34] wonderful now overseas many times we see
[4:38] that happen in the foreign countries
[4:40] that I'll be standing speaking and it
[4:43] will turn right back around and use my
[4:45] language and call people their names and
[4:47] everything just like it does here in
[4:49] their own native language that's what I
[4:52] call pentti kahma stuff that's a Holy
[4:57] Spirit now the last few nights we
[5:02] haven't been giving out any prayer cards
[5:04] for a prayer line so I believe it would
[5:07] be an order tonight to have a prayer
[5:09] line to pray for the sing all next week
[5:13] beginning Tuesday night we expect to go
[5:16] all through next week so you come out
[5:19] each night come praying bringing
[5:21] somebody with you the boys will be
[5:24] giving out the prayer cards and about 35
[5:27] minutes as soon as the service is
[5:29] finished here and you who want a prayer
[5:31] card just remain now they all bring
[5:34] their prayer cards up here and give them
[5:36] out to anyone who wants them
[5:38] may the Lord at ease blessings to all
[5:41] that we do for we do it in his name now
[5:47] to our subject and to our lesson for a
[5:51] few moments brother David read the
[5:55] scriptures because I just met an old
[5:59] friend that's setting present this
[6:02] afternoon about two years ago I was up
[6:06] on the river of no return with my good
[6:10] friends the Christian businessman I'm
[6:13] loved to hunt and they had a new guide
[6:18] that year and I Connie fell in love with
[6:22] this man a young fella and he would I
[6:26] liked him there seemed to be something
[6:29] about him that was a little more than a
[6:32] cowpoke and I had met his wife
[6:36] she was a waitress at the restaurant at
[6:39] the place where we were eating up at
[6:42] North fork's near Salmon River Idaho and
[6:46] on the road back it happened to be that
[6:49] God let this young fella become a chum
[6:54] to me to hunt with me and I remember
[6:58] getting a good shot one morning at my
[7:01] elk way across the valleys and and got
[7:04] him very humane and this young fellow
[7:07] was helping me skinned him out and I was
[7:10] noticing him and I said to him Jim
[7:14] are you a Christian and I believe he
[7:18] said he'd long to some church or
[7:20] something another but there was
[7:23] something about him it seemed honest
[7:27] that night when we went in sit at the
[7:30] table I kept watching him while he was
[7:33] laying on his camp bag sleeping I passed
[7:36] by and laid my hand upon him and asked
[7:40] God to save him and today him and his
[7:45] lovely little wife meets me back here in
[7:47] the back there are both Pentecostal
[7:50] believers has got the Holy Ghost setting
[7:52] present now prayer changes things
[7:56] brother Gliss be oh he's so real if we
[8:02] just pray and then believe that we get
[8:05] what we asked for so that's why I had
[8:09] brother duplicity to read the word for
[8:12] me I just had to greet Jim and his wife
[8:15] God's give him a lovely little baby
[8:17] since then we're happy now brother David
[8:23] was reading out of the book of Kings of
[8:25] Elijah the great prophet
[8:29] and it must have been a terrible morning
[8:34] dry and hot there hadn't had no rain for
[8:40] three years and six months
[8:42] it was so dried hot - the world was
[8:46] ready to blaze into the
[8:50] the people were starving in the streets
[8:53] and there was a cry everywhere all this
[8:59] had been brought on because of the moral
[9:03] decay of the nation Israel was loved of
[9:08] God but when they got out of the will of
[9:12] God the enemy taken them over God loves
[9:16] his church but when we get out of the
[9:20] will of God the enemy takes the church
[9:22] over and Ahab who was king of Israel at
[9:28] that time and to my thinking the most
[9:32] wicked King Israel ever had because he
[9:37] married an idolaters Ebell she was a
[9:42] sinner and an ungodly person and instead
[9:47] of being a man of his own house he gave
[9:51] in to her and through that they had
[9:55] caused the nation to come to moral decay
[10:00] then went after brought the nation into
[10:03] idolatry because it they'd went after
[10:05] her idols it's something similar to
[10:10] today all the people agreed that it was
[10:15] all right for him to do that because the
[10:19] government the king and the Queen
[10:23] endorsed it and they was the most
[10:27] popular people in that nation and
[10:31] because the king and the Queen did it
[10:34] the people thought that it would be all
[10:37] right now that's about the picture of
[10:42] our country today many people just
[10:46] follow one another and they think
[10:51] because that the government has given
[10:54] the boost sellers license to sell
[10:57] whiskey that it's all right to get drunk
[10:59] it
[11:00] wrong and many times good women think
[11:07] because that the cigarette companies
[11:10] puts these pictures out on these
[11:12] advertisements of women smoking
[11:14] cigarettes and the movie stars the many
[11:18] of them and the popular women smoke that
[11:21] it's alright that's what's caused our
[11:25] moral decay in this nation the backbone
[11:30] of any nation is motherhood break
[11:34] motherhood you broke the back of the
[11:36] nation and when I've got a statistics
[11:40] that shows that I believe it's about 80%
[11:43] of cigarette smoking mother's has to
[11:47] raise their baby's own bottles because
[11:51] there's so much nicotine in their blood
[11:53] it will kill the baby before it's 18
[11:56] months old you talk about a sabotage
[12:02] that's one of the greatest sabotages the
[12:06] nation's got and regardless of all of
[12:12] the warnings that the doctors put out
[12:14] such slogans as cancer by carload and
[12:19] all these warnings the people want to
[12:23] follow one another because it's some
[12:28] silly woman actress of some sort
[12:33] advertises cigarettes and and blows it
[12:36] through her nose and act smart
[12:38] but that's no place or no thing for a
[12:42] lady to do it's wrong I was passing down
[12:50] one of your streets here a few days ago
[12:53] and I seen in a barroom it said tables
[12:58] for ladies I don't mean to be rude I
[13:03] don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but
[13:06] ladies don't go on places like that
[13:10] they've never had one in there I'd
[13:19] imagine they've never had a customer and
[13:21] never will because it's no place for
[13:25] ladies but find people sometime see
[13:32] those things and and see people who are
[13:36] up and up what we call go into such
[13:40] places and they think that's the thing
[13:42] for them to do fear God and keep his
[13:47] Commandments for this is the whole duty
[13:53] but you see that the King had said this
[13:58] is alright because his wife thought it
[14:01] was alright and then caused the moral
[14:04] decay and then they thought because they
[14:08] were prosperous no wars and so forth
[14:12] that that was a sign that God was with
[14:14] him
[14:16] prosperity is not always a sign that God
[14:18] is with you many times that's deceiving
[14:26] the rain falls on the just and the
[14:29] unjust but it's by their fruits they are
[14:33] known and so this nation was really
[14:38] corrupted and God had sent judgment upon
[14:43] all the preachers had been under the
[14:48] heavy load because the members of the
[14:51] church had forced them to do things I
[14:54] feel sorry for a preacher that's got no
[14:58] more God about him than to let his
[15:00] congregation dick to him and get him off
[15:02] in a rut like that I believe that we
[15:06] need preachers that's man that's
[15:09] god-fearing God sent servants who's not
[15:13] afraid to come back black and white
[15:15] white the Gospels been handled too much
[15:19] now with kid gloves on
[15:22] we need some old-fashioned preaching
[15:26] like Billy Sunday and John the Baptist
[15:28] and some old-fashioned hell fire
[15:32] brimstone messages again back to the
[15:35] people I know it's not popular so when
[15:38] they got away from that you see water
[15:40] condition the nation's got in so it it
[15:44] takes that brother and all that the
[15:48] pastor's to give in so they let the that
[15:51] had a social gospel no doubt and so but
[15:56] there was one who didn't give him there
[16:00] was a little old prophet in the land in
[16:03] that day he didn't bow down to any of
[16:06] their idols for he knowed that Jehovah
[16:10] was a holy God and he required holiness
[16:15] and cleansiness and decency or he know
[16:20] that Jehovah could not change and if
[16:24] Jehovah the bring the children out of
[16:27] Israel had to cleanse and sanctify them
[16:32] and when they walked disorderly
[16:35] according to his Commandments he placed
[16:37] judgment upon them he note that Jehovah
[16:40] was the same yesterday today and forever
[16:43] therefore he would not give him Oh Jesse
[16:47] Bell hated him and all of her company
[16:51] hated him but God loved and respected
[16:56] him because he never let down on the
[17:00] word of body stayed with it God give us
[17:04] more Elijah's in this cruel evil day of
[17:07] corruption that we're living in that's
[17:10] not a scared to preach what's the truth
[17:15] what the Bible says without holiness no
[17:18] man shall see the Lord
[17:21] you must be cleansed from your sins by
[17:24] the blood of the Lord Jesus now there
[17:30] was a woman in the land neither one of
[17:34] these people
[17:34] know each other but she must have been
[17:38] an honorable woman she must have been
[17:41] the type of woman that Elijah was a man
[17:45] because God chose that woman out of all
[17:51] the women that there was in Israel to
[17:54] entertain his prophet and he would have
[17:57] never chosen immoral woman they
[18:00] entertained his prophet and this woman
[18:03] was a winter woman the drought was in
[18:08] the land and she started out after the
[18:12] death of her husband she had a little
[18:15] baby to raise and she was struggling to
[18:20] try to make a living for the little
[18:23] fella
[18:23] and finally the bread begin to season it
[18:30] come to a place one day when she went in
[18:33] to look at her little fella had she seen
[18:37] his little sleeves out Turin she might
[18:43] have looked at herself in a mirror and
[18:44] seen that how she left the table with
[18:47] something on it for the baby and her own
[18:51] cheek bones are sticking out and her
[18:55] little frail looking arms she didn't
[18:59] mind it for herself but the little boy
[19:05] she was crying didn't want to see him
[19:08] die so finally one day she went to the
[19:13] meal bell and there was just one handful
[19:16] of meal left she goes over to the cruise
[19:21] to see how much oil and just about a
[19:25] good tablespoon full that's stood
[19:30] between her and death I suppose that
[19:36] night there was an all-night prayer
[19:38] meeting isn't it strange how God lets us
[19:42] get right down to the end of the road
[19:46] no doubt but she checked up said Lord
[19:50] God something like this I've heard you
[19:55] I've done all that I know how to do I've
[19:59] met your requirements here I've got one
[20:03] handful of meal and a spoonful of oil
[20:06] between death for my child and myself
[20:10] all night long she must have prayed and
[20:15] when the little fella would wake up turn
[20:19] over and say mama would you go back to
[20:25] the cupboard and see if there just a
[20:27] little bit of that bread left she'd go
[20:32] back cry a little and then she would
[20:39] come back and give him a little water to
[20:41] drink for she knew she could just had
[20:45] this little bit and it had maybe make
[20:48] the next day and the little fella maybe
[20:51] couldn't sleep good because of hungry
[20:56] I've been through those places no doubt
[21:00] but what there's many here been through
[21:02] those places I see my mother leave the
[21:05] table of the morning set back in the
[21:07] house and cry when she what we had on
[21:11] the table is some stale bread and she'd
[21:14] pour some coffee over to some sugar over
[21:16] the top of it for us kiddies and go back
[21:19] in the room and weep say I'm not hungry
[21:23] when she was hungry that's trying to go
[21:27] to school like that and the woman as she
[21:33] seen knows that crucial hour coming no
[21:37] doubt she checked up and said Lord I've
[21:41] done all that I know how to do when
[21:45] you've done everything that you know how
[21:47] to do and met every requirement that God
[21:52] has required that's where faith takes a
[21:56] hold
[21:57] that's where faith comes in if you've
[22:01] met every requirement that God required
[22:04] you to do then sometimes God tests your
[22:09] faith to see what kind of a reaction
[22:12] you'll have on your action or he's good
[22:17] at that it just lets it just proves
[22:21] whether you really believe what you
[22:22] think you believe you know it does that
[22:27] many times one morning there was some
[22:30] Hebrew children was going to be burnt up
[22:32] and they knew that they had done God's
[22:37] will and they said we're not afraid of
[22:43] the Kings commandment our God is able to
[22:47] deliver us from this fiery furnace
[22:50] nevertheless will not bow to his image
[22:55] God was going to give him a test to see
[22:58] what their reaction to their action
[23:00] would be and he let them walk right
[23:04] straight to the fiery furnace before he
[23:06] ever moved but when all of God's
[23:10] requirements has been met and you're
[23:13] certain of God that God will do it stand
[23:17] still there and battle do it if you sit
[23:23] in these meetings and you sing the Lord
[23:26] God move out over the audience healing
[23:31] the sick and afflicted and yet you seem
[23:34] to still have your disease and when I
[23:38] asked from the put hands on each other
[23:40] and you've made your wrongs right before
[23:44] him you've accepted him and you've been
[23:48] baptized in Christian faith and your
[23:51] hearts clean before him then sometime
[23:55] when gob delays his answer he's only
[23:57] wanting to see what you react by just be
[24:01] sure that you believe that it's God and
[24:05] then hold on to it don't
[24:09] if you've been prayed for hands laid
[24:13] only by believers the Bible said these
[24:15] signs shall follow them that believe
[24:19] that's God's requirement and God
[24:24] requires you to believe his word job God
[24:30] let the devil test job once when job
[24:34] went out and made a burnt offering for
[24:36] his children they had a party so job
[24:40] note in his days what teenagers is like
[24:43] what they were made up of that mind that
[24:46] can't get settled and so job said
[24:50] perhaps what if my children did sin I'll
[24:54] offer a burnt offering for him anyhow
[24:58] and money was standing on that aisle
[25:03] free what God required a burnt offering
[25:08] that's all he required to confess and
[25:12] make a burnt offering and job no he did
[25:17] that and then the devil was turned loose
[25:20] on him and he began to kill his children
[25:24] destroy his goods and he had some of his
[25:28] church members come to him and said you
[25:30] are a secret sinner you've got something
[25:36] in your heart that you haven't confessed
[25:38] job but don't know that he hadn't done
[25:42] it he was sure that he hadn't met God's
[25:47] requirements and he stood and said he
[25:52] knowed he confessed his sins call for
[25:56] God to trim' search him and see if there
[26:00] was anything wrong see God was just
[26:03] waiting to see what Joba do because
[26:05] Satan said I'll make him curse you to
[26:07] your face but God said there's none like
[26:10] him in the earth he won't do it
[26:12] God had confidence anything I maybe if
[26:16] your healings are angered a little bit
[26:18] God's got confidence in you that your
[26:22] if you believe that the Holy Spirit the
[26:26] signs and wonders that he promised is
[26:28] being done here then accept that and
[26:31] hold on to it God's requirement I'm the
[26:34] Lord who heals all our diseases when you
[26:39] receive the Holy Spirit get burned again
[26:42] I'm the devil of against the tip Chi oh
[26:45] you're wearing the same clothes you look
[26:47] like you used to but you're sure that
[26:50] something happened inside of you God
[26:55] changed your life don't make any
[26:58] difference whap the devil said just get
[27:00] away from it because you're sure that
[27:04] it's God amen amen means so be it
[27:11] I'm sure the Holy Spirit is here now I'm
[27:20] sure of it and I know that what we asked
[27:26] we will receive it it might not come
[27:29] just right now
[27:30] but it's got to come God's promise is
[27:34] true we asked him for anything
[27:39] we don't doubt we believe that what we
[27:42] asked for we get because we met God's
[27:46] requirements giving our life to him
[27:49] shrink our will to him our lives our
[27:52] soul all that we are we have surrender
[27:54] to God then our heart condemns us not we
[27:59] can have what we asked for
[28:01] if he abide me and my word and you asked
[28:04] what you will and it shall be done unto
[28:06] you that's his promise just be sure that
[28:12] you know God and know what that's his
[28:15] promise someone said to me many times
[28:18] brother said aren't you afraid brother
[28:22] Branham when you go there at nighttime
[28:23] that maybe that angel of the Lord might
[28:26] leave you sometime I said
[28:29] sure he won't because he promised me he
[28:34] wouldn't do it I've got faith in God to
[28:38] believe in you meet that requirement
[28:42] that night Portland that maniac ran out
[28:46] on a platform to kill me you've read the
[28:49] story you better be sure of it then but
[28:53] I was sure that I wasn't trying to speak
[28:56] of myself when he called me a snake in
[28:59] the grass and spit in my face and said
[29:02] tonight I'm going to knock you all the
[29:05] way out into that audience I just stood
[29:09] still he weighed 250 or more Highway 128
[29:14] I had to look up to him those great big
[29:17] giant Li arms and his teeth set in his
[29:20] eyes his fist drawback running towards
[29:22] me and the Spirit of God said because
[29:27] you challenge the Spirit of God tonight
[29:29] you fall over my feet that was God that
[29:34] wasn't me so he said I'll show you whose
[29:37] feet I'll fall over and he drew his
[29:39] fists back to hit me and when he did I
[29:42] said Satan come out of the man and he
[29:45] fell and pinned my feet to the floor to
[29:48] the policeman had to roll him over my
[29:50] feet just be sure it's God and then hold
[29:54] on to it stay with it God says anything
[30:00] he has to keep his word just be certain
[30:05] that it's God take God's Word if God
[30:09] whispers your heart I'm the Lord that
[30:12] healeth thee stay with it that's God's
[30:15] promise God promises to give the Holy
[30:19] Spirit stay with it until it comes I was
[30:25] reading old uncle buddy Robinson's book
[30:28] here some time ago and he was playing
[30:31] Korn he said with his old mule etic and
[30:35] he got mad at Alec that morning because
[30:37] she was tramping down the Carn any
[30:41] on the ears and she ran off and looked
[30:46] at him and he said Alec I'm ashamed that
[30:49] I you said it looky here me
[30:51] preaching sanctification with the teeth
[30:54] full of new hair is that what a disgrace
[30:57] and then he got ashamed of himself
[31:00] and he got down in the row of corn and
[31:05] said if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[31:08] when you come back you'll find a pile of
[31:09] bones laying here then he received it be
[31:15] certain it's God then hold on to it she
[31:19] was certain she'd walked upright before
[31:22] God and God proved it by inviting his
[31:26] prophet to live with her see God
[31:29] confirms things so the morning was
[31:34] breaking the birds was beginning to sing
[31:39] his dog began to break
[31:42] she looked at the little fella again and
[31:44] she patted him she knelt down and said
[31:48] Lord God he'll be getting up in a few
[31:52] minutes I'll go and prepare the last
[31:56] thing I got and give it to him and then
[31:59] I'll take him in my arms and we'll die
[32:04] together so she went and got the handful
[32:09] of meal now meal was a meal offering
[32:13] which means Christ the word and when
[32:17] they ground the meal offering in the
[32:19] days of the Bible they used a certain
[32:21] bird that ground every little bit of
[32:24] meal just exactly the same there was no
[32:28] difference in it well that types this
[32:32] the same means Jesus Christ is the same
[32:36] yesterday today and forever when God
[32:39] ground his life out of him at Calvary he
[32:42] gave it to the church that he would be
[32:44] the same
[32:48] then she goes and gets the oil the oil
[32:52] represents the spirit that's we while we
[32:54] anoint with oil it represents the spirit
[32:58] and she put the spit the oral and the
[33:01] meal together and begin to prepare it
[33:04] and when the spirit and the word gets
[33:07] together something's going to take place
[33:10] [Music]
[33:12] she was at the end so she got the word
[33:16] and the spirit and beginning to mix it
[33:19] together now it's ready for bacon she
[33:23] goes out in the yard to pick up two
[33:26] sticks did you notice the Bible said two
[33:29] sticks now in the old days Jimmy I guess
[33:35] we've done it many times ourselves you
[33:37] take two sticks and cross them and you
[33:39] put the fire right in the middle and as
[33:42] the sticks burn you push them in if
[33:44] you're camping out at night it keeps the
[33:47] fire going all night long
[33:48] pushing it in the fire was in the middle
[33:51] if you notice the two sticks represented
[33:54] the cross self-sacrifice
[33:59] now she mix the word and the the spirit
[34:03] together and was ready to put it to the
[34:06] fire and she goes to pick up these
[34:12] sticks and perhaps you just got the last
[34:15] one in her hand and was starting back in
[34:17] the house and she looked at the gate
[34:19] there was a gentle looking old man
[34:22] perhaps bald-headed and whiskers hanging
[34:25] down standing lean across the gate he
[34:29] said would you fetch me just a little
[34:32] drink of water she looked at even
[34:36] thought well I've got just about a half
[34:41] a gallon in the house but the poor old
[34:45] fellas look so thirsty I'll be willing
[34:49] to divide with him and she might have
[34:53] said yes kind sir I will get you a
[34:57] little water
[34:58] because the springs have dried up and
[35:00] everything all water's had dried up and
[35:04] she started in to get the water and he
[35:09] note you see God answers on both ends of
[35:14] the line about two hours before that the
[35:19] brook had dried up on top of the
[35:21] mountain where Elijah was
[35:22] he said Elijah go down to the city and
[35:27] keep walking until you find a woman with
[35:30] two sticks in her hand
[35:31] she's gonna feed you God does things
[35:34] real I've sent you down there and she's
[35:39] going to feed you she hasn't got nothing
[35:42] in the house but I'm going to feed you
[35:45] and he walked down the street till he
[35:49] seen that woman packing those two sticks
[35:51] and that must be her so he had to catch
[35:54] her attention he said would you fetch me
[35:57] a little water and she said I will and
[35:59] she's turned and started he said and
[36:02] just bring me a little morsel of bread
[36:04] in your hand
[36:05] Elijah's seeing that vision already know
[36:08] what the conditions was and she said as
[36:11] the Lord liveth I too knew she was a
[36:15] Christian and a believer as the Lord
[36:18] liveth I've only got just a handful of
[36:21] meal and a spoonful of oil that have
[36:24] already prepared I've dressed it got it
[36:27] ready and I'm taking these two sticks to
[36:31] make a little cake for my son and I and
[36:33] we're going to eat it and I see now here
[36:38] comes a great lesson but he'll I just
[36:42] said bake me one first Oh what is it
[36:49] there what lesson do we learn seek ye
[36:52] first the kingdom of God and His
[36:54] righteousness make me one first and she
[37:01] looked she said I wonder who that is
[37:05] there's something about the man that
[37:09] seems to be
[37:11] i nee said break me one first and bring
[37:15] it and she started in to do what he said
[37:18] then she heard that comforting word that
[37:20] always comforts for thus saith the Lord
[37:25] the barrel of not meeting her the crew
[37:28] shrunk
[37:29] until the day that God sends rain on the
[37:32] earth what was it that very dark crucial
[37:37] moment come but God's always on the
[37:40] scene if you're sure that it's God if
[37:43] you've repented of your sins if you've
[37:47] met God's requirement then be sure that
[37:51] God will keep his promise women can only
[37:58] realize that God's obligated to his
[38:03] promise and a few various requirements
[38:06] if you confess your sins and you made
[38:10] your wrongs right and you've done
[38:12] everything God has required then hold on
[38:16] to God you've got to see daylight he's
[38:18] got to bring you through just be certain
[38:21] that it's God and he'll take care of the
[38:26] rest of it if you're sure that it's God
[38:32] some time ago I was over at a little
[38:36] city in Arkansas
[38:37] about 15 years ago not quite that long I
[38:41] say 12 years ago I have a terrible
[38:44] segregation in Arkansas and I've been
[38:47] into a little church and the policeman
[38:49] helped me in and out I was coming out of
[38:52] the church and I could hear someone
[38:55] saying Mercy Mercy
[38:58] I thought worries that coming from and I
[39:03] looked over to my left standing over to
[39:06] one side stood up a Negro man
[39:09] we're out from the white people he had
[39:12] his a little cap in his hand hard mercy
[39:16] merci and something struck me that man
[39:21] wants to talk to me and I said to the
[39:24] policeman I said I want to go over to
[39:26] see that man always said mr. Branum you
[39:29] can't do that you'd start trouble here
[39:31] in Arkansas said you can't do that he
[39:34] said we just can't let you do that I
[39:36] said but the Holy Spirit's telling me to
[39:39] go he said my brother Ram you'll start a
[39:44] race right so all these white people
[39:46] here to be prayed for and you go there
[39:47] their colour minister octane tout what
[39:49] kind of laws you got I follow a law and
[39:52] that law is the law of the spirit and he
[39:56] said go to that man and I just pull
[39:59] loose from him and I went over there and
[40:01] I heard his wife say people good courage
[40:04] honey the parson is coming and I got
[40:08] over there I said how do you do you had
[40:10] his hands out I guess he said is you I'm

[40:40] Christian since I was a little boy my

[40:59] they don't wrapped around the optical
[41:01] nerve and he couldn't take him off he
[41:05] said I never heard of you in my life
[41:07] parson Branham but said last night about
[41:10] nine o'clock I went to bed he said I
[41:14] dreamed I saw my old man he come up to

[41:51] raining as hard as it could rain I
[41:53] looked at him I put my arms around him I
[41:57] said Lord God I don't know but somehow
[42:01] he's certain and I'm certain that you
[42:06] let his old mammy come to him in a dream
[42:09] that tell him that he's going to get his
[42:10] sight and he's so sure that he's going
[42:14] to get his sight Lord God let it be now

[43:26] both climbed the golden stairs into your
[43:29] kingdom I shall see him there because he
[43:36] was certain he couldn't read your word
[43:38] but you spoke to him by dream and by his
[43:42] truthful mother
[43:44] and he was certain that his mother
[43:46] wouldn't LA and if you had sent him a
[43:50] dream javis mother he knew that he was
