[41:24] person that left the note at my back
[41:27] door I uh they didn't leave their name
[41:31] on it but I I certainly uh appreciate
[41:35] them doing that and uh I would love for
[41:39] them to uh come talk to me that'd be
[41:43] wonderful I really like to uh um share
[41:49] those things and have a deeper
[41:51] understanding of those things but so God
[41:54] is uh really good um I I want to kind of
[42:00] build on what I'm
[42:03] done are they I I really believe they
[42:06] think I'm going to sing someday Tim if
[42:08] you'll sing with me I'll sing No we're
[42:12] safe okay thank you
[42:17] um um
[42:19] but we we we understood this morning
[42:26] that he doesn't want to be ashamed of
[42:29] us and we
[42:32] understood what would make him ashamed
[42:35] of us and then as we talked within the
[42:39] framework of the
[42:41] message we saw that God is
[42:45] calling for a
[42:47] people that will not be ashamed of him
[42:52] embarrassed and we realize that in every
[42:55] age God had a
[42:58] way that he did things and it was always
[43:02] contrary to the way man thought it would
[43:06] be but he reveals it to those certain
[43:11] people and they see it and they
[43:15] recognize it and when they see it and
[43:18] they recognize it they've received that
[43:23] Revelation from God and and that's what
[43:26] revelation does revelation is to see
[43:30] something that was previously
[43:34] hid and when something's hid from you
[43:37] and you don't know it exist you're only
[43:40] going to act accordingly to the things
[43:42] that you see right that reminds me of
[43:46] the of I think it was Gesa when when he
[43:50] said oh my goodness look at all these
[43:53] armies Master what are we going to do
[43:56] we're doomed where uh it's it's all over
[44:01] it can't get worse than this our pipes
[44:03] are froze for
[44:05] sure and he just was there and and uh
[44:10] and the great prophet said Lord open
[44:15] these boys'
[44:17] eyes there's more with us than there are
[44:20] with them and in an
[44:23] instant his eyes were open and he saw on
[44:27] the Hills all around the Angels were
[44:31] encamped about them do you know the
[44:34] angels of the Lord are encamped about
[44:36] the righteous and those that serve him
[44:40] but because he couldn't
[44:42] see and and he didn't have the the
[44:46] vision and the Revelation to catch the
[44:50] picture and that's why Revelation really
[44:53] is a gift of God because it allows you
[44:56] to see many people they they see brother
[44:59] brandom's Ministry and they believe that
[45:02] he was a a a great healer uh they talk
[45:06] about his gift all the time on
[45:11] television because they have to do
[45:13] something with it when the lady in the
[45:16] purple dress showed up yeah they were
[45:20] like what do we say and they talk about
[45:22] the visions and they talk about and they
[45:25] have all kinds of explanation for it but
[45:28] they never saw him as a
[45:31] deliverer of a
[45:34] message and therefore if they don't see
[45:37] him as a deliverer of the message they
[45:39] don't look for the message to speak to
[45:41] him but God has given you Grace and he's
[45:46] opened your eyes and he said blessed is
[45:49] he that hath ears to hear or understand
[45:53] what the angel said so that great that
[45:57] great gift that God gave you of
[46:00] Revelation to be able to see is a
[46:04] wonderful privilege and it should never
[46:08] cause us to have ill feelings to those
[46:12] that can't see that's right and and so
[46:17] we we want to uh talk so if you have
[46:20] your
[46:22] Bibles we're going to go through
[46:25] scripture by scripture
[46:27] uh St John uh the not not the Gospel of
[46:31] John but the epistle what we call first
[46:35] John
[46:36] 4 first John 4 and
[46:41] so we talked about being ashamed but now
[46:45] the scripture is going to speak to us
[46:47] and John is going to write to us the
[46:55] description of
[46:57] somebody that God is not ashamed of so
[47:02] in other words if you possess these
[47:04] things as we go through them that's what
[47:07] the father is not ashamed of um and you
[47:11] know I don't know if the person that
[47:12] left me the note is listening but these
[47:16] these uh two
[47:18] chapters will Ex really
[47:22] explain everything to you if you could
[47:25] get this in your heart it it's it's very
[47:30] marvelous now just to jump
[47:33] ahead uh this is just a little study so
[47:37] I want to go to the fifth
[47:40] chapter and the 13th
[47:44] verse and this verse gives
[47:49] you the understanding of why that John
[47:55] wrote this letter
[47:58] and it says these things have I written
[48:01] unto
[48:02] you that believe on the name of the son
[48:08] of God that ye may know that ye have
[48:13] eternal life and that ye may believe on
[48:17] the name of the son of God so the motive
[48:21] on it was he wrote this so we would have
[48:26] a way
[48:27] to measure and to judge that we have
[48:31] eternal life there's all kinds of tests
[48:35] that you take you know I I have to go
[48:38] have my blood checked and they run this
[48:40] great big list of test and then they
[48:43] tell me you know that this is out of
[48:45] balance and that's out of balance and
[48:47] this is too high and this is too low and
[48:51] and you know when you get done reading
[48:53] the report you think you might as well
[48:55] go visit the Undertaker
[48:58] you know but I believe that that
[49:00] nothing's going to happen until God's
[49:04] done that that I know and so I just
[49:08] trust in that I do my best brother Bram
[49:10] said it was our obligation to do
[49:12] everything that we could in our power to
[49:16] to get our help and then the things that
[49:19] are beyond our control we place into his
[49:24] hands so this is a a
[49:29] test it seems that it is but it's a test
[49:33] of the spirit it's a way you can really
[49:37] test yourself and so let's just read it
[49:41] together and verse by verse and we'll
[49:44] talk and make comment uh it said
[49:49] beloved believe not every
[49:54] Spirit but try by the
[49:58] spirits whether they are of God because
[50:03] many
[50:04] false prophets are gone out into the
[50:08] world and so he's saying many New
[50:12] Testament preachers many people are out
[50:16] there preaching
[50:18] things and I'll tell the one
[50:24] identification of the Antichrist spirit
[50:27] is it
[50:29] divides it doesn't matter if it divides
[50:32] by culture it doesn't matter if it
[50:35] divides by economy it doesn't matter if
[50:39] it if it divides by color it doesn't
[50:43] matter what it does the spirit of
[50:47] antichrist is the spirit of division FL
[50:52] it's the spirit of what's against Christ
[50:56] that's what Antichrist means it's anti
[50:59] or against Christ so it's against what
[51:03] the Lord is trying to do because God's
[51:07] trying to do something he's trying to
[51:11] accomplish something he we read this
[51:13] morning that he wants to represent
[51:17] himself in
[51:20] you and he said anybody that accepts him
[51:23] and been been saved is it has a the
[51:28] portion of God in them they're they're
[51:32] they're part of God and God wants to
[51:35] represent himself in a certain way if
[51:39] somebody C comes in my name or for
[51:43] example I give a
[51:45] recommendation to somebody that this is
[51:48] a a good a mechanic or a good painter I
[51:53] I don't they're they're going in my name
[51:55] they're saying uh uh Mr McGary uh uh
[51:59] said that you needed some work done and
[52:01] I recommend them and then I go over
[52:03] there and there's paint drips up and
[52:05] down the driveway and they Park their
[52:07] van in the driveway and there's a big
[52:09] old oil spot and and you go in and and
[52:13] and you find out that that you know
[52:15] there's runs and streets in the wall and
[52:18] and you think I recommended this
[52:22] person you know it it uh uh
[52:27] that that's not representative of the
[52:29] kind of work that I
[52:31] do so now we're asking ourselves are we
[52:36] representative of the kind of work that
[52:39] he does because we are what his
[52:44] workmanship so we're testifying this is
[52:47] the work I'm right here is the work that
[52:51] God has
[52:53] done so that's what he's saying try
[52:56] every Spirit whether or not they're
[53:00] preaching and bringing us to the quality
[53:06] of
[53:07] workmanship that is in Christ
[53:10] Jesus he's done the work he did the work
[53:14] at Calvary he did the work in the upper
[53:17] room and he's still doing that work so
[53:19] we read that this morning that the
[53:22] spirit there's many spirits out there
[53:25] many people that can bring but stay with
[53:27] it and see what it produces does it
[53:32] produce a
[53:34] division and let me tell you something
[53:37] what once you've been born again and the
[53:40] spirit of God is in your heart if
[53:42] someone doesn't believe your doctrine
[53:44] that doesn't move you a
[53:48] bit that's not the quality that we're
[53:52] after we we our heart is is if God's
[53:57] given us a
[53:59] revelation we want them to have that
[54:02] revelation we want to share what God's
[54:05] done for us you know we we never want to
[54:08] be those that cast on
[54:12] Devils you know we're supposed to cast
[54:15] Devils off unbelief off but so let's
[54:18] just read this is beautiful I I hope you
[54:21] enjoy going through the word of God it
[54:23] meant a lot to me he says hereby know ye
[54:29] the spirit of
[54:31] God every spirit that confess us that
[54:37] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
[54:42] God now I I hope you listen this morning
[54:46] because that's what he said he said
[54:48] they're not
[54:49] ashamed of being identified with him I'm
[54:53] a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a
[54:57] presbyterian I believe in Jesus but what
[55:00] they're ashamed of is that he manifests
[55:04] himself in the flesh so any spirit
[55:10] that denies that Jesus Christ the
[55:15] nature the
[55:18] personality the thinking let this mind
[55:21] be in you that was in Christ Jesus let
[55:25] everybody look upon the needs of the
[55:27] other above themselves if they don't
[55:30] confess that he personal pronoun Lives
[55:36] In the Flesh and manifests himself not
[55:40] in teachings I'm a Baptist I'm a
[55:43] presbyterian I'm a Methodist I'm a Hindu
[55:46] whatever but doesn't confess that he can
[55:52] live his nature out through
[55:56] human
[55:58] beings that's how you know the true
[56:02] spirit that that's how you know that's
[56:05] the judge that you know the spirit of
[56:08] God if it's the spirit of God you know
[56:12] that by is it Christ in the flesh not in
[56:17] the mind not in the teaching not in the
[56:20] doctrine but in the
[56:24] flesh in other words just someone smites
[56:26] you on the cheek your answer is you smot
[56:30] a Son of God you're going to hell May
[56:34] the fires of judgment rain down upon
[56:39] you no you know it's God if you turn the
[56:43] other
[56:46] cheek it it's
[56:48] manifested in the very way you think in
[56:52] the very way you respond brother brandom
[56:54] said this morning you can
[56:56] tell whe whether they're ashamed or not
[56:59] or they believe the word beh of how they
[57:03] exercise it exercise means to put into
[57:07] action it doesn't mean to go lift
[57:09] weights or read your Bible in your
[57:11] garage and talk about it it means to put
[57:14] it in the practice so now he these are
[57:18] the things he wants us to know because
[57:21] it proves to us we have eternal life he
[57:24] says confess that Jesus Christ has
[57:27] come in the flesh is of God and every
[57:31] spirit that confesseth not now confess
[57:35] you you don't just confess something
[57:36] with your
[57:38] mouth your confession is really in your
[57:43] actions because a guy that tells you
[57:45] he's really there to help you and he's
[57:48] got while you're sitting there talking
[57:49] to you he's lifting your wallet out of
[57:52] your pocket his confession is not true
[57:57] but his confession is the fact that he
[58:00] carries out what he's talking about so
[58:04] it's not what people think oh if you
[58:06] confess that the Lord's come in the
[58:08] flesh you're saved well that's true if
[58:11] you're confession is I'm proving to you
[58:15] by my life and by my actions that he's
[58:18] come now we know he's got room for
[58:21] growth in all of
[58:23] us and he does
[58:26] have us grow as we go through
[58:29] experiences but he wants us to be
[58:33] sure that we're sure of our eternal life
[58:36] because what causes people to be ashamed
[58:39] is when they are not
[58:43] sure it is is not of God and this is the
[58:48] spirit of
[58:50] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[58:54] should come and even now already is in
[58:59] the world so the spirit of
[59:03] antichrist is the spirit that says the
[59:07] love of God is not shed abroad in our
[59:11] heart by the Holy
[59:14] Ghost that's the spirit of
[59:16] antichrist that Christ hasn't come in
[59:19] the flesh we know that Christ is come in
[59:22] the flesh when the spirit and the love
[59:25] of God
[59:26] is shed abroad in Us by the Holy
[59:30] Ghost I mean the Christianity is not
[59:34] Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago in the
[59:38] flesh Christianity is Jesus Christ has
[59:42] come in this flesh because I've been
[59:46] redeemed by the blood of the lamb and I
[59:51] bear or I carry as he said this morning
[59:55] or I walk in the testimony of the
[1:00:01] Resurrection how do I testify that he's
[1:00:04] resurrected how would anybody know he's
[1:00:07] resurrected because he lives in me he
[1:00:11] walks with me he talks with me he it's
[1:00:14] evident he's alive because he's alive in
[1:00:17] me now his
[1:00:19] nature and his
[1:00:22] love John's going to get into it any
[1:00:26] that is not a part of that that causes
[1:00:29] division or hatred or anything is not of
[1:00:34] God that's right that's right and we're
[1:00:37] only interested in one thing we are
[1:00:41] members of another kingdom we are
[1:00:43] members of the kingdom of God we're
[1:00:46] ambassadors of the kingdom of God we are
[1:00:49] not trying to straighten out this world
[1:00:51] we are trying to leave this world
[1:00:58] and this is the way you
[1:01:01] leave this is the spirit you have to
[1:01:04] have in you to leave if the same spirit
[1:01:08] that dwelt in Christ Jesus dwell in you
[1:01:11] it will Quicken your mortal
[1:01:14] body so anything that's not
[1:01:20] representative of that
[1:01:22] spirit is Antichrist
[1:01:28] that's what John's saying here listen
[1:01:29] it's beautiful go home and read
[1:01:32] it he
[1:01:34] said is
[1:01:37] already is already come and is in the
[1:01:40] world ye are of God little children and
[1:01:44] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:01:49] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:01:54] world
[1:01:56] okay you've overcome those things and
[1:01:59] the Antichrist spirit because greater is
[1:02:03] he that is in you that's what he's
[1:02:06] talking about confessing that he's come
[1:02:10] in the flesh that greater is he oh I'm
[1:02:13] going to get excited and I told myself
[1:02:15] I'm not going to get
[1:02:17] excited but greater is he that is in
[1:02:20] you than he that is in the world that's
[1:02:23] what I'm confessing I'm confessing that
[1:02:26] there's somebody else that's in me he's
[1:02:29] birthed me he's born again he forgave me
[1:02:32] of my sins and he's come and he's living
[1:02:35] in me and forgive me when my
[1:02:38] flesh Rises up I don't mean
[1:02:43] that oh my so greater is he now they
[1:02:49] that are of the
[1:02:52] world now don't I want oh I I use that
[1:02:57] word I want because my vocabulary is not
[1:02:59] big enough to find another word but I'm
[1:03:02] going to try to look in the
[1:03:04] dictionary you know when it says my
[1:03:07] desire is to share with you or if I
[1:03:10] could say this to fellowship with you in
[1:03:13] God's word he says now they are of the
[1:03:19] world therefore speak they of the world
[1:03:24] oh my yes yeah oh that's what they speak
[1:03:28] about they speak about social injustice
[1:03:32] they speak about wages they speak about
[1:03:35] the environment they they speak about
[1:03:38] this they speak about that that's what
[1:03:40] they speak about why because they're of
[1:03:43] the world and if they're of the world
[1:03:45] they're concerned about the
[1:03:49] world save the whales
[1:03:58] you know God hasn't lost one
[1:04:02] whale every whale that he wants on the
[1:04:05] other side will be on the other side you
[1:04:07] think there'll be whales on the other
[1:04:09] side I
[1:04:13] do there's going to be a horse there I
[1:04:15] know
[1:04:16] about there's going to be a dog there I
[1:04:19] know
[1:04:21] about so I love whales there ought to be
[1:04:24] a whale there that
[1:04:26] over there
[1:04:29] too the
[1:04:32] carnal it is so
[1:04:35] amazing that people get wrapped
[1:04:39] up and that's what it is Republican
[1:04:43] Democrat uh independent
[1:04:47] libertarian blah blah blah blah
[1:04:51] blah all the social justice issues all
[1:04:55] the the things of the world all how that
[1:04:59] people have betrayed one another and
[1:05:01] enslaved one another but did you know I
[1:05:04] was a
[1:05:06] slave I was I was a slave to sin I was a
[1:05:11] slave to drugs I was a slave to lust I
[1:05:13] was a slave to hatred but praise God I'm
[1:05:17] no longer a slave to
[1:05:23] sin all men were in slavery all men were
[1:05:26] in
[1:05:30] bondage you can go back through
[1:05:34] time you know I mean if it wasn't too
[1:05:37] long ago they million they murdered
[1:05:39] millions of
[1:05:44] cambodians they had a an ethnic
[1:05:47] cleansing of everybody that had an IQ
[1:05:50] above
[1:05:54] two they killed the doctors that was
[1:05:57] kind of a remark I guess nobody knows
[1:05:59] what a good IQ score is you know I think
[1:06:02] mine's about
[1:06:04] 178
[1:06:09] so hey I think I'm smarter than 99% of
[1:06:13] the people in the world yeah because
[1:06:15] they don't accept God's word and if I
[1:06:17] can see the message and I accept God in
[1:06:20] my eyes that makes me pretty smart
[1:06:26] that's
[1:06:27] right you know cuz Einstein won't be
[1:06:31] there unless God
[1:06:34] realizes all
[1:06:39] right and and and so there's been a lot
[1:06:42] of
[1:06:43] things down through the they starved the
[1:06:46] Irish at one time when the Irish first
[1:06:48] came to this country they couldn't get
[1:06:51] work they were
[1:06:53] dogs spit upon
[1:06:56] and and and couldn't go into restaurants
[1:06:59] and couldn't
[1:07:03] eat they they they were forced into
[1:07:07] housing that was so wretched and so poor
[1:07:11] and kept in a certain part of of the
[1:07:14] city and
[1:07:16] stuff
[1:07:20] no they fought their way
[1:07:23] out but those are things of the
[1:07:27] world little children ye are not of the
[1:07:30] world ye are of
[1:07:35] God and so it says they that are of the
[1:07:38] world therefore
[1:07:40] speak they of the
[1:07:43] world and the
[1:07:46] world heareth
[1:07:49] them that's why they're marching the
[1:07:51] world heareth them they speak of the
[1:07:54] world and the World heareth
[1:08:00] them we are of
[1:08:03] God he that knoweth God heareth
[1:08:08] us he that is not of God heareth us not
[1:08:13] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[1:08:19] the spirit of
[1:08:22] air now what will the spirit of Truth do
[1:08:26] it'll set you free from the things the
[1:08:31] world talks
[1:08:33] about
[1:08:36] right the reason some people are in the
[1:08:39] world and talking of the world is
[1:08:41] because they haven't been born
[1:08:45] again and and they see the hatred they
[1:08:49] see the social unjustice they see the
[1:08:52] starving they see these great problems
[1:08:56] that we have and they keep talking about
[1:08:59] them but John's going to share with us
[1:09:02] what the answer
[1:09:07] is he said now we know the spirit of
[1:09:11] Truth and air
[1:09:14] beloved let us love one
[1:09:17] another for love is of God and everyone
[1:09:23] that loveth is born of God God and
[1:09:26] knoweth God that's how we know what the
[1:09:29] spirit of Truth is and the spirit of air
[1:09:32] a man that walks in the truth loveth his
[1:09:36] brother that's
[1:09:38] right he loves all the children of
[1:09:42] God well tonight when the brother sang I
[1:09:46] I I was hearing
[1:09:49] English of course I knew the
[1:09:52] song but it was still wonderful to enter
[1:09:55] into fellowship and hear the words and
[1:09:59] unless he was singing a different song
[1:10:01] to the same
[1:10:06] tune but but you you see what we have to
[1:10:10] move into we have to move into the
[1:10:16] Capstone because God is love this this
[1:10:20] this is what he's going to cap his
[1:10:22] church about that love that repres if
[1:10:26] God so loved the world he sent his only
[1:10:29] begotten
[1:10:31] son so now we're moving into the
[1:10:35] Capstone
[1:10:39] Lord is born of God and knoweth God he
[1:10:43] that loveth
[1:10:45] not knoweth not God for God is
[1:10:51] love so this is how he's going to
[1:10:54] identify us whether or not we followed
[1:10:59] him do are we following if we're going
[1:11:01] to follow him we have to follow him in
[1:11:04] the love wherein he loved
[1:11:08] us that's what we have to have that's
[1:11:11] what we have to possess is a love for
[1:11:13] our brother Rich poor whether they eat
[1:11:17] hot chilies or or they make something
[1:11:20] that's so hot it burns you
[1:11:23] alive you love them
[1:11:28] you don't care about their
[1:11:30] culture you don't care about their diet
[1:11:33] you don't care about where they come
[1:11:35] from that's right you love
[1:11:38] them you love them
[1:11:43] am I'll tell you the difference the love
[1:11:47] in a Christian makes them
[1:11:53] act uh
[1:11:55] a a a
[1:11:59] political or social issue makes you
[1:12:04] talk and that's how they're
[1:12:06] identified because they talk about the
[1:12:08] world and the world here a Christians
[1:12:11] borned of love and does the works of
[1:12:14] love and manifest the love of God here
[1:12:17] in is the love of God
[1:12:22] manifested that's what Jesus taught
[1:12:25] don't see don't don't see somebody
[1:12:28] that's hungry and go out and say oh it's
[1:12:33] so terrible people are hungry feed
[1:12:35] them if they're not clothed clothe
[1:12:40] them do what you can to manifest the
[1:12:44] love of God and then says so it's just
[1:12:47] beautiful let's just read I think you'll
[1:12:49] love it I love
[1:12:51] it he that loveth not knoweth not God
[1:12:55] for God is love for for in this was
[1:13:01] manifested the love of God towards
[1:13:06] us this is the
[1:13:09] manifestation of the love of God towards
[1:13:11] us because that God sent his only
[1:13:15] begotten son into the
[1:13:20] world that we might live
[1:13:25] through him may I make put that in
[1:13:29] another terminology that we might live
[1:13:31] by him or that our
[1:13:34] life might come from
[1:13:46] him the only begotten son hearing is
[1:13:50] love not that we love God
[1:13:56] herein is love not that we love God but
[1:14:01] that he loved us and sent his son to be
[1:14:07] the
[1:14:08] perpetuation of our sins beloved if God
[1:14:13] so loved us we ought to love one
[1:14:18] another amen there now now we're talking
[1:14:21] about the spirit of truth and the spirit
[1:14:25] of air the spirit of truth knows
[1:14:30] God right it it loves God that that's
[1:14:35] the spirit of Truth this is how we know
[1:14:38] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[1:14:41] air this is how we know the spirit of
[1:14:43] antichrist because remember anybody that
[1:14:46] rejects the spirit of
[1:14:49] God gets the mark of the
[1:14:53] beast so the men it that the spirit fell
[1:14:58] that put the love of God shed abroad in
[1:15:00] our hearts by the Holy Ghost the
[1:15:03] Antichrist Spirit fell the divide and
[1:15:07] talk about worldly things and all these
[1:15:10] political issues and social issues and
[1:15:12] economic
[1:15:15] issues that's the
[1:15:18] spirit but the spirit of God talks about
[1:15:21] God it loves God it shares God
[1:15:25] it shares the truth because that is the
[1:15:34] truth no man hath seen God at any
[1:15:40] time if we love one
[1:15:43] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[1:15:49] is
[1:15:51] perfected in
[1:15:53] US you say what's God perfecting in
[1:15:58] us we all want to be more perfect what
[1:16:01] is the word
[1:16:03] perfecting what is God perfecting what
[1:16:06] is the
[1:16:08] church that we become mental Giants or
[1:16:12] love
[1:16:15] Giants
[1:16:17] right
[1:16:19] amen you know the
[1:16:23] scripture there's so many goodt
[1:16:26] scripture he
[1:16:28] says that that his love is perfected in
[1:16:34] US hereby know we that we dwell in him
[1:16:41] and him in us because he hath given
[1:16:47] us
[1:16:48] his
[1:16:53] Spirit okay what was his
[1:16:57] spirit that he laid his life down for
[1:17:01] us that he forgave us of our sins he
[1:17:04] bore our
[1:17:07] trespasses when he came
[1:17:09] across the people and he saw that they
[1:17:12] had no food he had compassion on them he
[1:17:16] went the extra mile when he meant a a a
[1:17:20] a a a woman that lost her livelihood
[1:17:24] because her son had passed away he
[1:17:26] raised them
[1:17:28] up let this mind be that was in Christ
[1:17:33] be in you that every person looks upon
[1:17:36] the need of
[1:17:38] others you know we want to always judge
[1:17:42] whether we have the spirit by some sort
[1:17:46] of
[1:17:48] manifestation but this is how you know
[1:17:50] you have the spirit if you have the
[1:17:53] spirit of God you you love your
[1:17:59] brother because that was what he
[1:18:03] was he
[1:18:06] said and and hereby we know that we
[1:18:11] dwell in him and he in us because he
[1:18:15] hath given us his spirit and we have
[1:18:19] seen and do
[1:18:22] testify that the father sent the son to
[1:18:26] be the savior of the world
[1:18:32] wherefore who whoever shall
[1:18:35] confess that Jesus is the son of God God
[1:18:40] dwelleth in him and he in
[1:18:43] God and we have
[1:18:46] known and believed the love that God
[1:18:51] hath to us
[1:18:56] that's it do you know the love that God
[1:18:59] has has toward you this is what John
[1:19:02] saying that we may know that we possess
[1:19:06] eternal life that we can get the
[1:19:09] question answered once and for all
[1:19:11] whether we have the spirit or not
[1:19:14] whether we have life or not we have it
[1:19:16] because we know that he loveth
[1:19:23] us and and hereby whosoever shall
[1:19:26] confess that Jesus is the son of God God
[1:19:29] dwelleth in him and he in God and we
[1:19:32] know and believe the love that God have
[1:19:36] to us God is love and he that dwelleth
[1:19:42] in love dwelleth in God and God in
[1:19:47] him that's what we're preaching that's
[1:19:51] what I was preaching this morning that's
[1:19:53] what I was talking about being getting
[1:19:55] carried away in something of the world
[1:19:57] because if you're born of God the love
[1:20:00] of God is in you that's your
[1:20:04] identification you don't have no hatred
[1:20:07] for
[1:20:10] nobody you have one thing in mind the
[1:20:13] only thing that matters to you is that
[1:20:15] that person you love possesses eternal
[1:20:19] life that's the life that means more to
[1:20:22] you than anything else here
[1:20:25] in is our love made
[1:20:30] perfect now what is he trying to do he
[1:20:34] already spoke up here
[1:20:36] earlier that that God dwelleth in us and
[1:20:40] his love is
[1:20:43] perfected in
[1:20:45] us now how are we going to know that
[1:20:48] that love is
[1:20:52] perfect he says herein is is our love
[1:20:55] made
[1:20:57] perfect that we may have boldness in the
[1:21:00] day of judgment because as he is so are
[1:21:06] we in this
[1:21:12] world you know I I I preach a sermon on
[1:21:18] being
[1:21:20] ashamed and someone writes me a note
[1:21:25] and they don't put their name on
[1:21:29] it I thought are they
[1:21:33] ashamed if they have the truth you're
[1:21:37] not ashamed of the
[1:21:41] truth you're not ashamed to come and put
[1:21:45] your name to what you believe and what
[1:21:50] you stand for that's right you're not
[1:21:55] ashamed be be
[1:21:59] identified you know I mean if if you
[1:22:03] don't feel my tie matches my suit and
[1:22:07] you want to tell me that put your name
[1:22:10] on
[1:22:13] it right don't leave me sitting here
[1:22:17] wondering that it's 300 people that
[1:22:22] that think my tie don't matter
[1:22:28] hatch if you don't think my time match
[1:22:31] is my
[1:22:32] suit if you're a Christian you'll go out
[1:22:35] and buy me one that
[1:22:40] does and if you don't have the money you
[1:22:43] will come to me and say brother mcgar I
[1:22:46] if I had the money I would get you a tie
[1:22:49] that matches that too but I'd really
[1:22:52] like to do that for you I'd be happy to
[1:22:53] give you the Mone
[1:23:00] I I'm just talking
[1:23:02] about are we
[1:23:04] ashamed that we can't put our name on
[1:23:08] our
[1:23:12] thoughts that if if we feel somebody's
[1:23:16] in air that that we won't share it with
[1:23:20] them or if you have something a word of
[1:23:23] advice you know uh the wonderful word of
[1:23:26] advice I received I'd like to thank you
[1:23:29] for
[1:23:33] it you know now I think I owe all of
[1:23:38] you so thank you
[1:23:42] all but here in Is This Love
[1:23:46] perfected that as he is so are we in the
[1:23:50] world there is no fear in love
[1:23:55] but perfect love cast out fear because
[1:23:59] fear hath
[1:24:03] torment he that fearth is not made
[1:24:09] perfect in
[1:24:12] love if you're still been out of shape
[1:24:16] over the world way the world treated you
[1:24:18] the way your teachers treated you the
[1:24:21] all the complexes you've had all the job
[1:24:24] JS that you couldn't get if you're still
[1:24:26] been out of all shape out of all those
[1:24:29] things I want to tell you as a brother I
[1:24:32] want to tell you as someone who's had
[1:24:34] the love of God expressed to him through
[1:24:38] the Forgiveness of sins that your love's
[1:24:42] not made perfect
[1:24:44] yet if things of this world still eat
[1:24:47] you up then you're not sure you're going
[1:24:51] to heaven let me tell you God is not
[1:24:55] going to waste his time fixing a world
[1:25:00] that he's going to
[1:25:03] [Music]
[1:25:05] destroy he's calling people out of this
[1:25:12] world and that's what he said this
[1:25:15] morning is when the calling out time
[1:25:18] comes to say that you're not a part of
[1:25:22] any of it
[1:25:27] Are you ashamed of
[1:25:29] that I'm not a part of it that's right
[1:25:32] I'm not a part of any social movement
[1:25:34] I'm not a part uh of any political party
[1:25:38] I'm not a part of any economical growth
[1:25:41] I'm not a part of
[1:25:48] it almost every dime I have is
[1:25:53] invested in this
[1:25:55] body of
[1:26:00] Believers but I'm filthy rich on the
[1:26:03] other
[1:26:06] side Hallelujah I got streets of gold
[1:26:09] I've got purly
[1:26:11] Gates no man layeth his treasures in
[1:26:14] this
[1:26:16] world but he put his
[1:26:19] treasures where the thief can't come in
[1:26:21] and take them who's the th
[1:26:25] the devil that robs you of your peace
[1:26:28] that robs you of your joy that robs you
[1:26:30] of your victory that robs you of your
[1:26:33] confidence that puts complexes on you
[1:26:36] fooy with that
[1:26:39] guy I'm tired of
[1:26:42] him man if you see him anywhere near me
[1:26:45] come tell me please cuz he sneaks up
[1:26:49] like a cat
[1:26:54] I can't do a cat as good as Jeff can do
[1:26:56] a
[1:27:09] horse let me
[1:27:14] know you know I wouldn't say that if I'm
[1:27:16] not getting to it in a
[1:27:18] minute it's right here in this books
[1:27:31] he that fearth is not made perfect in
[1:27:34] love we love him because he first loved
[1:27:39] us if any man say I love God and hateth
[1:27:44] his brother he is a
[1:27:48] liar any man that's got an ounce of
[1:27:51] bigotry an ounce of hatred an ounce of
[1:27:54] any of that doesn't know God and the
[1:27:57] love of God's Not in him you know if if
[1:28:00] we want to get rid of hatred and bias
[1:28:03] and bigotry out of the world lead
[1:28:06] somebody to the
[1:28:10] fountain that the love of God's in their
[1:28:13] heart because if they have any of those
[1:28:15] things they know not
[1:28:21] God and you're just barking down around
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:26] Trail as long as there's a
[1:28:29] devil there's hatred as long as there's
[1:28:32] a devil there's lying as long as there's
[1:28:35] a devil there's there's there's
[1:28:38] stealing because the fruit of the
[1:28:41] flesh are those
[1:28:44] things but where God is there's
[1:28:47] peace where the spirit of God is there's
[1:28:51] joy where the spirit of God is there's
[1:28:54] life and Liberty in Christ Jesus oh
[1:29:00] people don't serve the
[1:29:03] world or the leader of this world don't
[1:29:07] buy into his philosophies don't buy into
[1:29:10] those things the best thing you can do
[1:29:12] for any man in this whole world is
[1:29:16] introduce them to the
[1:29:22] Savior you're giving them freedom and
[1:29:25] liberty they're proud of their
[1:29:28] experience they're not ashamed of what
[1:29:30] God's done for them any believer that's
[1:29:33] been bought by the cross that's had
[1:29:36] their price paid for them they know what
[1:29:38] God's biding if you meet anybody I don't
[1:29:41] care what their denomination is where
[1:29:44] they come from if they know that love of
[1:29:46] God I'll tell you you'll wrap your arms
[1:29:48] around him and say isn't he wonderful
[1:29:55] get all these
[1:29:57] complexes there's not Bond or
[1:29:59] free male or free
[1:30:04] female but we are
[1:30:06] christs and he is
[1:30:09] God I'll tell you someone that's caught
[1:30:11] in that needs to be born
[1:30:18] again any man say I love God and hateth
[1:30:21] his brother he's a liar for he that
[1:30:24] loveth not his brother whom he hath
[1:30:29] seen how can he love God whom he hath
[1:30:33] not
[1:30:36] seen hate and love don't abide together
[1:30:39] the Bible teaches us these two things
[1:30:42] don't abide
[1:30:44] together either it's him that lives in
[1:30:47] you or it's somebody else that lives in
[1:30:52] you remember God doesn't give
[1:30:57] options this fifth
[1:31:00] chapter whosoever believeth that Jesus
[1:31:04] is the
[1:31:05] Christ is born of God now what does that
[1:31:10] mean he that believeth see we have such
[1:31:13] a carnal thing that we keep looking back
[1:31:16] in history that Jesus is the Christ that
[1:31:19] means that Jesus is the anointing
[1:31:24] Spirit
[1:31:26] yes that that's the spirit that is
[1:31:29] anointing me that is the spirit that
[1:31:32] makes me think that is the spirit that
[1:31:35] makes me
[1:31:37] do that is the
[1:31:40] spirit amen that who that
[1:31:44] Jesus is the
[1:31:46] Christ is the right anointing is born of
[1:31:51] God and everyone that loves
[1:31:54] him that begot loveth him also that is
[1:31:59] begotten of
[1:32:02] him you know what beget or begotten
[1:32:05] means it means to
[1:32:10] produce everyone that loves him produces
[1:32:16] him and everyone that produces him has
[1:32:20] been
[1:32:21] produced of him
[1:32:24] in other words that's what our testimony
[1:32:26] is the testimony of the Resurrection The
[1:32:30] testimony of the Lord is the life that's
[1:32:33] in us has been produced by
[1:32:39] God that's the only life we stand for
[1:32:42] that's the only life we preach that's
[1:32:44] the only hope we
[1:32:47] have the only hope we have is the spirit
[1:32:52] of God that's been begotten in us oh my
[1:32:57] church we don't get sucked
[1:33:03] away is there a Christian Republican I
[1:33:06] don't think
[1:33:10] so is there a Christian Democrat I don't
[1:33:13] think
[1:33:14] so because a good soldier doesn't
[1:33:18] entangleth his things in the Affairs of
[1:33:21] the world that's not what we talk now I
[1:33:24] say vote your conscience that's fine
[1:33:26] whatever you think is best for you and
[1:33:29] for the country but that's not what we
[1:33:34] share we share him and him
[1:33:41] alone so those that are produced of
[1:33:45] God by this we know that we love the
[1:33:49] children of
[1:33:51] God when we love
[1:33:54] God and keep his
[1:33:59] Commandments wouldn't that be a sermon
[1:34:02] just going down through all the things
[1:34:04] Jesus taught us to do to feed the sick
[1:34:06] to visit the Father the visit the wi the
[1:34:10] the homeless the fatherless to visit the
[1:34:13] widows in their
[1:34:16] afflictions for this is the love of God
[1:34:20] that we keep his Commandments and his
[1:34:23] commandment ments are not
[1:34:26] Grievous for whosoever is born of God
[1:34:30] overcometh the
[1:34:33] world and this is the victory that
[1:34:36] overcometh the world even our
[1:34:41] faith who is he that overcometh the
[1:34:45] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:34:49] is the son of
[1:34:51] God this is he that o this is he that
[1:34:57] came by water and blood even Jesus
[1:35:02] Christ not by water only but by water
[1:35:06] and blood and it is the spirit that
[1:35:10] beareth witness because the
[1:35:14] spirit
[1:35:16] is
[1:35:18] true you want to know what's true you
[1:35:21] want to know what's right you want to
[1:35:24] know what's good you want to know what's
[1:35:27] holy get the spirit of
[1:35:29] God because that spirit's going to make
[1:35:32] you love your brother it's going to make
[1:35:34] you love your sister it's that's going
[1:35:36] to make you love them no matter where
[1:35:38] they're from or how rich they are or how
[1:35:40] poor they are or how smart they are I
[1:35:42] think some of the dumbest people in the
[1:35:44] world's got the best love of
[1:35:50] God I hope you put me in the category of
[1:35:52] some of the dumbest people in the world
[1:35:55] because I want to be dumb to the world
[1:35:58] because the scripture says to the world
[1:36:01] it's
[1:36:04] foolishness the wisdom of the world is
[1:36:07] foolishness to God and the wisdom of God
[1:36:10] is
[1:36:11] foolishness to the world this is what
[1:36:14] we're striving for
[1:36:18] church it says this is the spirit of
[1:36:21] Truth This Love that he's talking about
[1:36:25] that's the spirit of
[1:36:28] truth that is
[1:36:31] truth
[1:36:32] for there are three that bear record in
[1:36:36] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[1:36:40] Ghost and these three are
[1:36:44] one in other words the father bore
[1:36:47] record of the word and the word bore
[1:36:50] record of the spirit they're one that's
[1:36:52] the record
[1:36:54] this is the record that's in order that
[1:36:56] these three are one not three different
[1:37:00] persons but one great witness and there
[1:37:04] are three that bear witness in Earth the
[1:37:07] spirit the water and the blood and these
[1:37:10] three agree in one if we receive if we
[1:37:15] receive the witness of men the witness
[1:37:18] of God is greater for this is the
[1:37:22] witness of God
[1:37:24] which hath testified of his son he that
[1:37:28] believeth on the Son of
[1:37:30] God hath the witness of
[1:37:34] him he that believeth not God hath made
[1:37:38] him a liar because we believeth not the
[1:37:43] record that God gave his son what was
[1:37:49] the record that God God gave his son
[1:37:52] that he so loved the world world that he
[1:37:55] gave his only
[1:37:59] produced
[1:38:02] son that's the only son he ever gave to
[1:38:09] die oh the only
[1:38:12] begotten of the
[1:38:16] father he that hath the son hath
[1:38:20] life and he that hath not the son Son of
[1:38:24] God hath not life these things I have
[1:38:28] written unto you that believe on the
[1:38:32] name of the son of God that ye may know
[1:38:36] assuredly without a
[1:38:39] doubt with with no
[1:38:42] reservation that ye may know that ye
[1:38:45] have eternal life and that ye may
[1:38:48] believe on in the name of the son of God
[1:38:52] and this is the
[1:38:54] confidence that we have in him that if
[1:38:58] we ask anything according to his will he
[1:39:01] heareth us and if we know that he
[1:39:05] heareth us whosoever we ask we know that
[1:39:10] we have the
[1:39:12] petition that we desire of him not if we
[1:39:17] know he's heard us we know we
[1:39:21] haven't If any man see his brother sin a
[1:39:26] sin which is not unto death he shall ask
[1:39:31] and he shall give him
[1:39:34] life for them that sinth not unto death
[1:39:39] there is a sin unto
[1:39:42] death and I do not say that we shall
[1:39:45] pray for it but all unrighteousness is
[1:39:49] sin and there is a sin unto death and a
[1:39:53] sin
[1:39:55] there there is a sin not unto death and
[1:39:59] you know that's we've been taught that
[1:40:01] if you see your brother in a fault you
[1:40:04] pray for
[1:40:05] him your very
[1:40:07] prayer might deliver him of that
[1:40:11] fault when you see your brothers in eror
[1:40:14] you go to that brother and you love that
[1:40:17] brother now there are sins unto death in
[1:40:20] other words confessing that
[1:40:24] the son of man has not come and that the
[1:40:28] spirit of God is be elub there's no
[1:40:31] forgiveness in this sin or the life to
[1:40:34] come when you see somebody doing that
[1:40:37] denying the truth and turning down the
[1:40:39] word of God you don't even pray for that
[1:40:43] person they've made their choice but the
[1:40:46] our fleshly sins we pray one for another
[1:40:50] we uplift one another
[1:40:53] we know that whosoever is born of God
[1:40:56] sinth
[1:40:58] not but he that is begotten of God
[1:41:02] keepeth
[1:41:03] himself and that Wicked one toucheth him
[1:41:08] not and we know that we are of
[1:41:12] God and the whole world
[1:41:16] lith in
[1:41:19] wickedness there's that word to me has
[1:41:22] two meanings in that
[1:41:23] the whole world
[1:41:25] lith it's a
[1:41:28] liar but it also the word means lith
[1:41:32] means prolonged
[1:41:35] stay it has a prolonged stay in
[1:41:39] wickedness you know when a a
[1:41:42] Christian if he makes a mistake or he
[1:41:45] unbeliev or he have sin he's quick to
[1:41:48] cry ABA
[1:41:50] father he doesn't lay there
[1:41:53] he doesn't stay in that prolonged
[1:41:56] condition he quickly makes it
[1:42:01] right but the world lies it doesn't tell
[1:42:05] the truth it doesn't have the love of
[1:42:08] God here in we know the spirit of error
[1:42:11] and the spirit of
[1:42:14] truth but it it has a prolonged stay in
[1:42:21] wickedness and we know that the Son of
[1:42:24] God is come and hath given us an
[1:42:29] understanding that we may know him that
[1:42:34] is truth and we are
[1:42:37] in him that is
[1:42:42] truth even in his son Jesus Christ this
[1:42:48] is the
[1:42:50] truth God and eternal
[1:42:56] life this is the true
[1:42:59] God the true
[1:43:05] life little
[1:43:07] children keep
[1:43:09] yourselves from
[1:43:12] Idols
[1:43:16] amen this is the
[1:43:18] spirit that each one of us needs to have
[1:43:24] no big eyes no little Jews an equal care
[1:43:29] one for another a love one for another
[1:43:32] undying spirit of God moving in our
[1:43:35] hearts towards all men here in they'll
[1:43:39] know that ye are my
[1:43:41] disciples when you
[1:43:44] love one
[1:43:46] another I want that love perfected in me
[1:43:49] and I'll know that love is perfect when
[1:43:53] as he is so am
[1:43:58] I and I hope
[1:44:02] that that that's our
[1:44:05] goal and I hope that's not what we're
[1:44:07] ashamed of we're not ashamed to have the
[1:44:11] love of God shed abroad in our hearts by
[1:44:15] the Holy Ghost God bless you brother
[1:44:18] Billy if you would come maybe if we
[1:44:20] would stand together
[1:44:23] I
[1:44:26] certainly
[1:44:28] can use more
[1:44:31] love and if I haven't had that love the
[1:44:34] way that I
[1:44:35] should then would you pray for
[1:44:38] me CU I hope it's not a sin unto death
[1:44:42] and would you pray that the love of God
[1:44:44] would be perfected in me because that's
[1:44:46] my heart's
[1:44:48] desire that we love one another even as
[1:44:52] he hath loved
[1:44:54] us and if you know your love if you've
[1:44:57] ever experienced
[1:45:00] it you know it it don't
[1:45:04] matter there's a lot of hatred in the
[1:45:07] land but if you know you're sealed in
[1:45:10] him you have
[1:45:14] pity because you know they don't know
[1:45:16] the father and they don't know God and
[1:45:20] try every Spirit whether it loves God
[1:45:24] whether it knows God whether it has the
[1:45:26] love of Jesus Christ shed abroad in its
[1:45:30] heart by the Holy Ghost that's how we
[1:45:33] measure our
[1:45:36] Salvation is by the love that's
[1:45:39] reflected in
[1:45:43] us can you love them that despise
[1:45:49] you that's the measure yes of
[1:45:55] Christianity can you turn your
[1:45:57] cheek to them that Smite you and call
[1:46:01] you names and are full of
[1:46:06] hatred that's the
[1:46:09] Perfection that he desires that we're
[1:46:12] not ashamed of I'm not ashamed to be
[1:46:17] anointed by Jesus
[1:46:20] Christ because it's the power of God un
[1:46:24] salvation I'm not ashamed to be
[1:46:27] identified with him and his lifestyle
[1:46:31] and the things that he does because I
[1:46:35] know that here in is the love of God
[1:46:38] that we know the love of God that He
[1:46:40] gave His only begotten son and that's my
[1:46:44] testimony as wicked and as mean and as
[1:46:48] cruel as this world is I can lift my
[1:46:51] hands and say praise praise God I'm
[1:46:54] saved from
[1:46:56] him he lives and because he
[1:47:01] lives we live
[1:47:03] also amen let's bow our heads our
[1:47:07] heavenly
[1:47:10] father Lord you haven't given me the
[1:47:13] whole world to
[1:47:18] Pastor I don't have a message for the
[1:47:20] world
[1:47:24] Lord but
[1:47:27] you've given me a flock
[1:47:31] here Lord and I don't want them to be
[1:47:34] church
[1:47:36] members I want them to be bride
[1:47:40] members in a love affair with
[1:47:43] you and Lord all that we can do
[1:47:48] is desire that the love of God is made
[1:47:52] perfect in this
[1:47:54] body and that this body has no malice no
[1:47:59] Envy no Strife no hatred no
[1:48:06] variances because those things are the
[1:48:08] fruits of the
[1:48:09] flesh but love peace patience long
[1:48:13] suffering gentleness
[1:48:15] [Music]

[1:48:19] evidence that your spirit
[1:48:22] is
[1:48:24] here Lord I may not know many
[1:48:30] things that people go
[1:48:33] through but I know the
[1:48:36] answer to everything that man goes
