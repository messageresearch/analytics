[15:25] trust you're excited to be here this
[15:26] morning all that visitors we welcome you
[15:28] you can turn around and welcome someone
[15:30] is invited by the mic for our psalm
[15:32] reading
[15:50] good morning
[15:53] go ahead and turn over to psalm 119
[15:55] again this morning
[15:57] i'm going to pick up in verse 121 and so
[16:00] is
[16:02] reading that this week i could not get
[16:04] past the first five verses
[16:07] there's just so much in there but that
[16:09] verse and
[16:10] that kind of starts out the section it
[16:12] says this
[16:13] it says i have done
[16:15] justice and judgment and justice
[16:18] leave me not to mine
[16:20] oppressors
[16:22] i have done
[16:25] not had
[16:27] and it's justice and judgment together
[16:31] not just justice
[16:33] not just judgment
[16:35] but justice plus judgment
[16:38] i have done
[16:40] you know i thought that was an unusual
[16:42] statement
[16:44] you know and judgment and justice are
[16:46] not the same thing
[16:49] you know that word justice means to make
[16:51] right or made right just
[16:54] impartial
[16:56] equity
[16:57] everything placed in its rightful place
[17:02] the word judgment means a verdict
[17:06] a decision
[17:07] a declaration good or bad
[17:11] something or someone
[17:13] given its proper identification
[17:17] so one has to do with position
[17:21] the other has to do with identification
[17:25] judgment i have done
[17:28] justice
[17:30] and judgment
[17:33] you know i was
[17:35] thinking about that and another
[17:36] scripture came to mind it was in psalm
[17:37] 89 14.
[17:40] and as we're looking at that you know
[17:42] we live in a world where we're
[17:44] surrounded by voices you know some of
[17:45] them are crying out for justice
[17:48] without judgment
[17:50] others are crying out for judgment
[17:52] without justice
[17:55] people wanting to place things in the
[17:57] way they see fit
[17:59] or give things labels that they think
[18:01] they should have
[18:03] but you know judgment without justice
[18:06] is ungodly
[18:08] and justice without judgment is ungodly
[18:10] man will always get it out of balance
[18:13] and it says in psalm 89 14 justice and
[18:16] judgment are the habitation of thy
[18:19] throne
[18:21] mercy and truth
[18:23] shall go before thy face
[18:26] the place where justice plus judgment is
[18:28] found is his throne
[18:31] it's in his presence
[18:32] his dwelling place
[18:35] you know it's interesting it's the
[18:36] earmark
[18:38] the evidence
[18:39] of his
[18:40] presence it's also interesting that the
[18:43] same verse says mercy and truth
[18:47] you know true justice requires mercy
[18:51] and real judgment requires truth
[18:55] you know he alone can execute
[18:58] true justice
[19:00] putting all things in its proper place
[19:04] and he alone can execute true judgment
[19:07] by giving all things its proper name
[19:12] and all things match their identity
[19:14] there's no favoritism
[19:16] there's no gerrymandering there's no
[19:19] trying to make things the way we want
[19:21] them to be
[19:22] everything in its right place
[19:26] you know we know the story of genesis 18
[19:29] where there were three visitors that
[19:30] came
[19:31] to go spend some time with abraham we're
[19:33] all familiar with the story
[19:36] you know it's where he
[19:38] sits with his back toward the tent
[19:40] discerns sarah's heart
[19:43] he's the one that says that you know
[19:44] shall i hide from abraham
[19:47] the thing that i do
[19:49] as he begins to turn his heart
[19:51] toward sodom
[19:53] and as he begins to share with abraham
[19:56] kind of the mystery
[19:57] of his plan he says an interesting
[19:59] statement
[20:01] in genesis 18 19 he says for i know him
[20:04] abraham
[20:07] that he will command his children and
[20:09] his household after him
[20:11] and they shall keep
[20:13] the way of the lord
[20:15] to do
[20:16] justice and judgment
[20:21] you know a couple things stuck out to me
[20:22] there first of all to do
[20:24] not have to do
[20:27] justice and judgment
[20:29] is the way of the lord
[20:31] it's in his throne it's an earmark of
[20:33] his presence to do his way
[20:37] you know it's uh
[20:39] interesting that as the prophets began
[20:41] to speak of this in
[20:43] jeremiah 23 5 it says behold the days
[20:46] come saith the lord that i will raise
[20:48] unto david a righteous branch
[20:51] and a king shall reign and prosper and
[20:53] shall execute judgment and justice in
[20:56] the earth
[20:58] speaking of a coming
[21:00] messiah
[21:01] isaiah 9 7 of the increase of his
[21:03] government and peace there shall be no
[21:05] end
[21:06] upon the throne of david and upon his
[21:08] kingdom to order it and to establish it
[21:10] with justice
[21:11] and judgment or rather with judgment and
[21:14] with justice from henceforth
[21:16] even forever
[21:18] the way of the lord
[21:20] the way that john prepared
[21:22] the word
[21:25] a son
[21:26] an image
[21:28] god in flesh form the way of the lord
[21:32] on earth
[21:34] to do
[21:35] justice and judgment
[21:37] together
[21:40] you know the scripture identifying that
[21:42] one who came with the same
[21:43] characteristic of what sat on the throne
[21:46] but you know the second thing that the
[21:48] lord told abraham
[21:51] was he said
[21:52] they shall keep
[21:55] the way of the lord
[21:57] to do justice and judgment speaking of a
[21:59] people
[22:01] who would do
[22:02] the characteristic of what was in the
[22:05] throne
[22:06] not have judgment
[22:09] not have
[22:11] justice
[22:12] do them both at the same time
[22:17] you know david had this characteristic
[22:20] says in second samuel 8 15 and david
[22:22] reigned over all israel and david
[22:24] executed judgment and justice
[22:27] unto all the people
[22:30] you know solomon has this nature as well
[22:32] because the queen of sheba traveled
[22:35] all that way to see if everything she
[22:36] had heard
[22:38] was true and her testimony in first
[22:41] kings 10 9 and ii chronicles 9 8 was
[22:43] blessed be the lord thy god
[22:46] which delighteth in thee on the throne
[22:48] of israel because the lord loved israel
[22:50] forever
[22:52] therefore made he the king
[22:54] to do justice and judgment
[22:57] the one who had asked for wisdom
[22:59] which says in proverbs 1 3 is justice
[23:02] and judgment
[23:05] you know
[23:06] many made to demonstrate
[23:10] made to do
[23:12] the characteristic of god
[23:15] justice and judgment you know brother
[23:17] david's been talking about the nature
[23:20] of his presence
[23:22] to put all things in their rightful
[23:25] position
[23:26] to give all things their proper identity
[23:29] by the word
[23:32] proverbs 21 3 says to do justice and
[23:34] judgment is more acceptable
[23:36] to the lord than sacrifice
[23:40] so as i was reading those five little
[23:41] words at the beginning of this psalm
[23:45] i have done
[23:47] justice and judgment
[23:50] my question to myself was
[23:53] have i
[23:55] do i
[23:58] do my judgmental
[24:00] do i have
[24:02] you know the desire to see justice or do
[24:06] i do
[24:08] judgment and justice which is the
[24:10] characteristic of the lord
[24:13] by his nature
[24:15] by his word
[24:17] so you can see i never got past the
[24:19] first five verses
[24:20] but the very characteristic of his name
[24:24] somebody's testimony i wonder
[24:27] i have done
[24:29] judgment and justice which is the way of
[24:31] the lord so as we read that together you
[24:33] know my prayer
[24:35] for myself at least
[24:37] is that
[24:39] it can be said of me that i have this
[24:41] characteristic i hope that's the prayer
[24:43] that each of you have let's just read
[24:44] that section uh starting in verse 121
[24:48] through 128 we'll read that together
[24:51] i have done judgment and justice leave
[24:54] me not to mine oppressors be surety for
[24:57] thy servant for good let not the proud
[25:00] oppress me
[25:01] mine eyes fail for thy salvation and for
[25:04] the word of thy righteousness
[25:06] deal with thy servant according unto thy
[25:08] mercy and teach me thy statutes i am thy
[25:12] servant give me understanding that i may
[25:14] know thy testimonies it is time for thee
[25:18] lord to work for they have made void thy
[25:20] law
[25:21] therefore i love thy commandments above
[25:24] gold yea above fine gold therefore i
[25:27] esteem all thy precepts concerning all
[25:30] things to be right and i hate every
[25:32] false way amen
[25:39] i bless you may have your seats
[25:47] it's the old time the holy spirit and
[25:50] the devil won't go near him that's the
[25:53] reason people

[51:03] the love that you have for us is beyond
[51:06] measure this morning
[51:09] or if we could just catch a glimpse of
[51:11] it i believe it would make a difference
[51:13] in our hearts
[51:16] lord we asked this morning that this
[51:18] time of fellowship we have may
[51:21] bring us closer to you
[51:24] it may encourage us and strengthen us
[51:28] the simplicity of the your word father
[51:34] be revealed to our heart and
[51:37] we just trust that the people this
[51:39] morning father will
[51:43] leave this place
[51:45] with hope and
[51:49] and strength to fight the great
[51:51] fight
[51:53] we ask you now to come in our midst
[51:56] you know what we have need up this
[51:58] morning before that we ask
[52:01] we present the needs that we know before
[52:04] you our sicknesses
[52:06] our health needs our financial needs
[52:10] [Music]
[52:12] this
[52:13] problems that we
[52:15] suffer
[52:17] lord you know things that we need that
[52:20] we don't know
[52:22] and we ask that you grant those things
[52:24] to us also this morning
[52:26] we ask your blessings now in your word
[52:29] in jesus precious and wonderful and holy
[52:32] name we pray
[52:34] amen
[52:35] amen god bless you this morning let's
[52:37] open our bibles this morning and
[52:41] just a little time of fellowship around
[52:43] the word
[52:45] trusting that
[52:48] there will be
[52:50] something said this morning that
[52:54] you can
[52:55] take and put in the building of your
[52:57] life and
[52:59] and the statue of the perfect man that
[53:01] you're trying to build
[53:03] i believe that's what we're trying to do
[53:04] right each of us build ourselves into
[53:08] a christ-like image
[53:10] and
[53:12] i'm glad he's not done working but
[53:15] he's still working
[53:17] amen i think there's a song right even
[53:20] when i don't feel it he's still working
[53:23] and i'm i'm glad that
[53:25] we don't go by feelings
[53:27] i i we go by promise don't we so
[53:30] whatever he promised is what's going to
[53:33] be done it
[53:34] doesn't matter if he said it it's going
[53:36] to happen
[53:37] i'm glad i can trust in that let's turn
[53:39] to romans the 12th chapter of the book
[53:44] of romans
[53:45] and
[53:48] we'd like to read
[53:52] the
[53:54] first two verses of the 12th chapter
[53:58] and
[54:02] just have a time of fellowship this
[54:03] morning and
[54:05] i know the church is at many different
[54:07] levels
[54:10] as growth it's like any flock you have
[54:12] lambs and
[54:14] you have
[54:16] different age groups and different
[54:18] experiences and
[54:20] and so we just hope the word of god can
[54:23] reach
[54:25] to
[54:26] the place that you are this morning
[54:28] we trust the holy spirit will do that
[54:32] i beseech you
[54:33] therefore brethren
[54:36] by the mercies of god
[54:39] that ye present your bodies a living
[54:42] sacrifice
[54:44] holy
[54:46] acceptable unto god
[54:49] which is your reasonable service
[54:52] and be not conformed
[54:55] to this world
[54:57] and
[54:59] if i would add a word there which i
[55:01] don't not saying by adding to or taking
[55:04] away
[55:04] but to make it
[55:06] closer to us
[55:08] and be
[55:09] and be not conformed to this present
[55:13] world
[55:14] this cosmos this world
[55:18] but be transformed
[55:20] by the renewing of your mind
[55:23] and that ye may prove
[55:25] what
[55:26] is that good
[55:28] and acceptable and perfect will
[55:32] of god
[55:33] and then let's also turn over to
[55:35] ephesians
[55:38] the fifth chapter
[55:41] of the book of ephesians
[55:43] and the 25th
[55:48] sixth and
[55:50] twenty seventh
[55:52] the verse and this let's read these
[55:55] scriptures this morning
[55:59] it says husbands love your wives
[56:04] even as christ
[56:06] also loved the church
[56:09] and gave himself for it
[56:13] you know i just
[56:14] you could just preach right from there
[56:17] but you got to remember he gave himself
[56:20] for you
[56:22] so
[56:23] um when you look at it that way
[56:26] we know that it's all about him
[56:29] but to him it's all about you
[56:34] you that's what that's what the word of
[56:37] god is about
[56:39] in the end of it all it's about you
[56:42] we worship him but what he did he did
[56:46] for you
[56:47] he gave himself for it
[56:50] that he might sanctify
[56:53] and cleanse it
[56:56] with the washing of the water by the
[57:00] word
[57:02] that he might present it
[57:04] to himself
[57:07] a glorious church
[57:09] not having spot
[57:11] or wrinkle
[57:13] or any such thing
[57:15] but that it should be
[57:18] holy
[57:20] without
[57:21] blemish
[57:22] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[57:25] word in your precious name we pray amen
[57:28] you may be seated this morning
[57:33] this this verse is a great verse and
[57:36] it says that he might present it to
[57:38] himself
[57:40] a glorious church
[57:43] and so
[57:44] that's the first thing we realized that
[57:47] not only do we want to be but that he
[57:50] promised that we would become
[57:52] is a glorious church
[57:54] amen
[57:56] not according to the idea of man
[57:59] which is great steeples and great
[58:02] temples and great buildings
[58:04] and
[58:05] but we don't look upon those things the
[58:07] glory of the church is the character of
[58:09] its people
[58:11] amen and then he says here that
[58:15] that the church not having spot
[58:19] or wrinkle
[58:20] or any such thing
[58:23] and so there's
[58:25] if
[58:26] that uh
[58:27] if i could say this just trying to
[58:31] show you a little like where we're going
[58:33] there's got to be a way
[58:35] to
[58:36] get rid of the spots the wrinkles and
[58:39] the blemishes
[58:40] and in just this little simple thought
[58:43] this morning i just want to encourage us
[58:45] that we have great hope
[58:48] in god's word for any of the problems
[58:52] that we carry the things that we face
[58:56] uh
[58:56] the trials that we go through
[59:00] he gave himself for it
[59:03] that
[59:04] any spots or wrinkles or blemishes
[59:09] that he could remove them from the
[59:11] church
[59:12] and he's purposed in his heart
[59:15] to have a glorious church
[59:18] and i know that the scripture says the
[59:21] flesh wars against the spirit
[59:24] and the spirit against the flesh and
[59:26] these two are contrary one to another
[59:30] and we all carry the burden of our flesh
[59:34] for some reason it's a very difficult
[59:36] thing
[59:37] to reign in
[59:39] it it it
[59:42] i mean
[59:43] my flesh gets me in trouble all the time
[59:46] paul spoke of it this way he said oh
[59:49] wretched man that i am you know when i
[59:52] would try to do good evils always
[59:54] present with me the great desire to be
[1:00:00] rid of this flesh and the things that it
[1:00:04] causes us to
[1:00:06] suffer and and to
[1:00:10] endure and we think we have it under
[1:00:13] control and
[1:00:14] the enemy just goes about setting snares
[1:00:17] and traps that we just fall into and we
[1:00:21] think we're strong and we go through
[1:00:24] seasons that we just feel like mighty
[1:00:26] christians you know what i mean like
[1:00:29] we're looking for the devil you know
[1:00:31] where you at i feel great today and then
[1:00:34] there's times where we just stumble
[1:00:38] and and and we fall and our continents
[1:00:42] falls and our
[1:00:44] and we become discouraged but god's got
[1:00:47] a great way
[1:00:48] of bringing us through these things and
[1:00:52] so
[1:00:53] those are the we just want to talk along
[1:00:55] that line this morning and
[1:00:57] and go through a little bit of the
[1:00:59] scripture and talking
[1:01:01] from this message called god's power
[1:01:05] to transform
[1:01:07] so god's got the power
[1:01:11] to transform
[1:01:13] now there's a part that we play
[1:01:16] and and
[1:01:17] it's a it it's a part that's
[1:01:20] easy for us to do
[1:01:23] if we could grab a hold of it
[1:01:26] and that's the hardest part about
[1:01:29] the word of god is that god hides
[1:01:32] himself in simplicity
[1:01:35] and he reveals himself in the same
[1:01:39] and i think we just heard here the other
[1:01:42] day about when the prophet told
[1:01:44] the king to go dip in
[1:01:47] the
[1:01:48] river
[1:01:50] remember that he said here goes the king
[1:01:52] holding his nose
[1:01:54] and he goes in there and he goes
[1:01:57] you know i don't want to dip in here
[1:02:00] there's cleaner water here he said but
[1:02:02] the word said dip here
[1:02:04] and and really it wasn't that hard of a
[1:02:07] thing to do
[1:02:10] it was a simple thing
[1:02:12] but we don't feel sometimes that we can
[1:02:15] get such great results
[1:02:17] from doing something so simple
[1:02:21] and just like me this morning you know i
[1:02:24] come out and i think lord i want to
[1:02:26] preach a sermon agree about great
[1:02:28] mysteries
[1:02:30] and about great
[1:02:32] revelations in those things but you know
[1:02:35] sometimes
[1:02:37] it's the the little things that we pass
[1:02:40] over
[1:02:41] that can do so much
[1:02:43] for us and
[1:02:45] and and so in looking at this we want to
[1:02:48] look at it from a very simple
[1:02:50] uh
[1:02:51] point of view that all of us might take
[1:02:54] hold
[1:02:56] because when i look at my problems
[1:02:58] they're my problems
[1:03:00] and i'm the one that caused the problems
[1:03:03] so i
[1:03:04] i i want to
[1:03:06] in myself i want to fix my problems
[1:03:09] i want to overcome by my own power
[1:03:13] you know what i mean but the same thing
[1:03:15] in me that wants to overcome is the same
[1:03:18] thing that's in me that's causing it
[1:03:22] yeah you know what i mean so tell me
[1:03:24] that ain't in this circle
[1:03:27] you know you punch yourself and then
[1:03:29] yourself comes back and punches you and
[1:03:32] you're in this eternal warfare and we
[1:03:36] find ourselves in this warfare how many
[1:03:38] knows where that warfare is at
[1:03:40] it's in your mind
[1:03:42] and and he's always accusing you and
[1:03:45] you're always struggling to to overcome
[1:03:49] you're always struggling to go better
[1:03:51] well we've been talking about having the
[1:03:54] nature
[1:03:55] of the lord and so in doing that we find
[1:03:59] this great uh
[1:04:01] this this great struggle
[1:04:04] and this conflict going on
[1:04:07] uh within us
[1:04:09] and and if there's a simple
[1:04:14] answer to it
[1:04:16] but so let's go back and as we we talked
[1:04:19] about this and and we read this
[1:04:22] scripture and
[1:04:24] so let's just walk through this for a
[1:04:26] little bit this morning
[1:04:28] and and maybe you can glean something
[1:04:31] this morning that'll sit with you
[1:04:33] that you could say okay if i do this
[1:04:38] it will produce the results it says
[1:04:43] i i like to
[1:04:44] you know when
[1:04:46] talking about
[1:04:49] you know there's always something out
[1:04:51] there
[1:04:52] that's going to provide you
[1:04:54] a vitamin or
[1:04:56] a pill that you can take and
[1:04:59] and uh you know
[1:05:01] you take this pill and it's going to
[1:05:02] relieve you of pain
[1:05:04] you know and then you go down and it
[1:05:06] says if you don't lift anything over 50
[1:05:09] pounds if you don't work over an hour a
[1:05:12] day you know there's all these
[1:05:13] conditions that that go with it you you
[1:05:17] know what i mean i remember i looked at
[1:05:20] diets one time and every diet was good
[1:05:23] eat this eat that and then they always
[1:05:25] had that part along with exercise
[1:05:29] well that ruined it right there you know
[1:05:32] i mean i didn't want the exercise part
[1:05:35] and sometimes we let the most important
[1:05:38] part go
[1:05:40] and uh so let's just i just want to read
[1:05:43] this and and and this statement so i i i
[1:05:46] don't know if caleb's in the back but
[1:05:48] i'm going to read a little bit out of
[1:05:50] the power of god's power to transform
[1:05:53] this morning and and
[1:05:55] i forgot to get this to the brothers
[1:05:58] ahead of time
[1:05:59] but it's it's september 11
[1:06:02] 1965
[1:06:04] at the full gospel businessman meeting
[1:06:08] i i really
[1:06:10] encourage you
[1:06:12] to take the time
[1:06:14] to
[1:06:15] listen to this
[1:06:16] message because it's it's a very
[1:06:20] stirring
[1:06:22] message
[1:06:23] from the standpoint is that every time i
[1:06:26] hear it it really brings me under deep
[1:06:29] conviction
[1:06:30] and it just makes me so aware
[1:06:34] of how much of the world it seems
[1:06:37] sometimes
[1:06:38] that we still have in us
[1:06:41] and we all want to overcome the world
[1:06:44] don't we i mean that's our that's what
[1:06:46] we're our desire is this morning and i
[1:06:49] don't want to forget happy birthday i
[1:06:51] think right god bless you this morning
[1:06:54] and uh the
[1:06:55] and so
[1:06:58] we have this desire in us
[1:07:01] to
[1:07:02] overcome
[1:07:04] but we don't have the power
[1:07:06] in us to overcome
[1:07:09] and that we got a hope
[1:07:11] that god's got transforming power
[1:07:15] so i'd like to read this with you if
[1:07:18] maybe the brothers could put it up on
[1:07:19] the board it's right after brother brahm
[1:07:22] reads his scriptures
[1:07:24] in paragraph
[1:07:27] 32
[1:07:29] in it and in this he says now if the
[1:07:32] lord willing i want to take my subject
[1:07:35] for this morning
[1:07:36] on god's power
[1:07:39] to transform
[1:07:42] that you might
[1:07:44] not be conformed to this world
[1:07:49] but be transformed
[1:07:51] by the renewing of your mind
[1:07:55] and now and prove that which is good
[1:08:00] perfect and acceptable will of god
[1:08:03] to prove what is the will of god i think
[1:08:06] that's the question that comes up
[1:08:09] in my mind more than anything it's
[1:08:12] what's the will of god am i in the will
[1:08:14] of god what's the will of god what's god
[1:08:16] want me to do and and
[1:08:19] when you come back in and you'll find
[1:08:22] out
[1:08:22] it's something because god's got the
[1:08:25] power to transform
[1:08:28] so if we if we could find this vein
[1:08:32] if we could find this thing that we're
[1:08:35] supposed to do
[1:08:37] and we do
[1:08:38] that thing that god's asking us to do we
[1:08:42] will find out that the results will come
[1:08:45] and the questions will come and the
[1:08:47] answers will come by the doing of the
[1:08:51] word of god
[1:08:54] it's not something that you're going to
[1:08:56] intellectually
[1:08:58] conceive
[1:09:00] and think that it's something that you
[1:09:03] that god's going to lay out a plan
[1:09:06] before you the will of god is something
[1:09:09] that is
[1:09:10] transforming you
[1:09:12] god's will is to transform you into a
[1:09:16] church without spot without wrinkle
[1:09:19] without blemish
[1:09:21] so that's what he's desiring to do
[1:09:24] that's what his will is his will is to
[1:09:27] present to himself a wife
[1:09:31] amen a church
[1:09:34] a glorious
[1:09:36] and perfect church what we say we call
[1:09:40] the church what the bride so his will is
[1:09:44] to present
[1:09:46] to
[1:09:47] gather
[1:09:48] to
[1:09:49] cleanse
[1:09:50] to purify
[1:09:53] to empower
[1:09:55] a a body of believers called his bride
[1:10:00] that he might present
[1:10:03] her
[1:10:04] to himself
[1:10:06] a glorious
[1:10:08] trophy
[1:10:10] of his love amen
[1:10:13] so that's that's what he's doing you
[1:10:16] know
[1:10:18] that's his will for you
[1:10:21] just think he wants to take you
[1:10:24] and transform you
[1:10:27] into his wife right
[1:10:30] now we look at ourselves
[1:10:33] and we all know where we come from
[1:10:36] and thank the lord we can say this
[1:10:38] morning that maybe we're not what we
[1:10:41] want to be
[1:10:42] and maybe we're not not what we should
[1:10:44] be but i feel that if you're even in
[1:10:47] this building this morning you're not
[1:10:49] what you used to be
[1:10:52] so we know he's working
[1:10:55] we know that he's that that we know that
[1:10:58] he has a goal
[1:11:01] he has a purpose
[1:11:03] he has a will something that he's trying
[1:11:06] to do so we we can't just get on this
[1:11:09] side of it
[1:11:10] that it's just us trying to do it we've
[1:11:12] got to do this we got to do this no he's
[1:11:16] got something he's doing he's got a will
[1:11:18] that he's doing he's got a purpose that
[1:11:22] he put
[1:11:23] we're his workmanship
[1:11:26] for his good pleasure
[1:11:30] we just ought to be thankful that he's
[1:11:32] chosen to make us part of it
[1:11:35] that's right
[1:11:37] so you're not alone
[1:11:42] you're not alone
[1:11:44] he's gonna he's going to
[1:11:46] mold you and make you
[1:11:48] he had something for paul to do
[1:11:52] paul's just going about his business
[1:11:54] think he's doing god a service man he's
[1:11:57] arresting the church and he's bringing
[1:11:59] him in and all of a sudden wham
[1:12:03] you know he's laying on the ground he
[1:12:05] says paul i've got to work for you to do
[1:12:09] i'm going to show you
[1:12:11] and and i'm glad that
[1:12:13] that i'm in his molding hands
[1:12:16] maybe he has to pound me a little more
[1:12:19] maybe he has to break me down a little
[1:12:22] more maybe it's a little harder for him
[1:12:24] but i'm glad that he's chosen
[1:12:27] us to mold
[1:12:30] and so let's don't forget this morning
[1:12:33] that he's doing something
[1:12:37] there's something he's got to accomplish
[1:12:40] there's something that he spoke
[1:12:43] that must come to pass
[1:12:45] and he's got all the ability and the
[1:12:48] power in the world
[1:12:51] and and out of this world to make it
[1:12:54] happen
[1:12:57] but remember what he said to paul he
[1:12:59] says paul it's hard to kick against it
[1:13:02] and maybe sometimes we kick against the
[1:13:06] the prick a little bit and we we try to
[1:13:10] fit our lives in
[1:13:12] to certain places but i think if
[1:13:15] anything this morning i think we should
[1:13:17] have confidence that god's got
[1:13:21] something he wants
[1:13:23] to do with me
[1:13:25] and and that gives me peace
[1:13:28] but let's just look at this as we go
[1:13:31] through and
[1:13:33] to build our confidence this morning
[1:13:36] he says now it's that have you found it
[1:13:39] brothers in
[1:13:40] god's power to transform phoenix arizona
[1:13:44] september 11
[1:13:45] 1965 paragraph 32.
[1:13:49] he says
[1:13:50] it's an old-fashioned text
[1:13:53] that
[1:13:54] many of your pastors have used down
[1:13:57] through your time
[1:13:59] it's been used since it was written
[1:14:03] and
[1:14:05] this this is a beautiful little
[1:14:08] section here
[1:14:09] but yet
[1:14:11] one thing about the word of god
[1:14:14] it never grows old
[1:14:18] because it's god
[1:14:23] it never grows old
[1:14:25] through every generation now
[1:14:29] for pretty near about 2 800 years or
[1:14:33] better
[1:14:34] this word of god
[1:14:37] has been read by man
[1:14:40] priest and so forth
[1:14:43] and never
[1:14:44] does it grow old
[1:14:47] i've been reading it myself for some 35
[1:14:51] years
[1:14:52] and each time i read it i find
[1:14:56] something new
[1:14:58] that i looked over the first time
[1:15:02] because it's inspired
[1:15:04] it's
[1:15:05] it's god in letter form
[1:15:08] see
[1:15:09] it's the attributes of god speaking
[1:15:12] forth
[1:15:14] and is placed on paper
[1:15:17] so if it's something about him
[1:15:21] the word of god is him amen
[1:15:24] it's his attributes is what he is it's
[1:15:27] placed on paper so those attributes are
[1:15:30] in there and he makes those attributes
[1:15:32] made known to him so you can't take the
[1:15:35] word of god and study it you can
[1:15:39] you can take it and study it like a
[1:15:41] theology and study it like a history but
[1:15:45] when when it becomes a person to you
[1:15:50] you understand that that it's someone
[1:15:53] that's talking to you now we're talking
[1:15:56] about his power
[1:15:58] to transform so you've got to see that
[1:16:00] he's got a power mixed in with this via
[1:16:04] he's got the ability to touch you he's
[1:16:07] got the ability to reach into your lives
[1:16:11] he's got the ability to to
[1:16:14] to
[1:16:14] change things he's got the ability to
[1:16:17] transform
[1:16:18] things so it's not it's not just
[1:16:21] something that's laying there
[1:16:24] in letter form it is laying there
[1:16:27] in letter form but he has the ability to
[1:16:30] take the letters and make it alive
[1:16:34] and to step into those words
[1:16:38] and make himself known to you
[1:16:44] so when you can enter into reading your
[1:16:47] scriptures
[1:16:49] if you you when and you come to that
[1:16:52] time that you're going to sit down and
[1:16:54] open the book
[1:16:55] and sit there and read and i know we do
[1:16:58] our daily bible readings and our daily
[1:17:00] devotions but in that look for his
[1:17:03] person
[1:17:05] look for his presence
[1:17:08] the presence of the lord is a wonderful
[1:17:10] thing
[1:17:13] it's the only thing that that
[1:17:16] that can lift you up
[1:17:19] and give you hope
[1:17:21] i mean our let's face it these are
[1:17:24] perilous times
[1:17:27] there there's this the world's falling
[1:17:30] apart
[1:17:32] people are are just
[1:17:35] they're they're they're not
[1:17:37] god's not in the picture
[1:17:42] and
[1:17:43] and you know
[1:17:45] we could talk about the fear
[1:17:48] and we could talk about the conditions
[1:17:51] and we can talk about the evil we may
[1:17:53] get into a little of that but let's
[1:17:56] remember one thing that we have a god
[1:17:58] that's got the power
[1:18:03] we've he's got the power
[1:18:05] and so as we greet this about the word
[1:18:08] he said
[1:18:10] he says many times man said
[1:18:13] well now man wrote this bible no the
[1:18:16] bible says itself
[1:18:18] that god wrote the bible it's the word
[1:18:22] of god
[1:18:23] it can never
[1:18:24] fail jesus
[1:18:27] said heaven and earth will fail
[1:18:30] pass away
[1:18:32] but my word shall never fail
[1:18:34] it cannot fail
[1:18:37] and
[1:18:38] being god because it's part of him
[1:18:42] and then you being a son and daughter
[1:18:45] you are part of it
[1:18:48] and that makes you a part of him
[1:18:51] so that's why we come to fellowship
[1:18:55] together around the word of god
[1:18:59] because you're part of it
[1:19:02] you understand how you're part of the
[1:19:04] word the whole word talks about
[1:19:07] that that he wants to present a church
[1:19:11] the word talks about a people that he
[1:19:13] died for the word talks about why that
[1:19:16] he came to redeem his own do you
[1:19:19] understand without you that there's
[1:19:21] nothing to the whole story
[1:19:24] it becomes fiction without you
[1:19:28] we say god's a healer with without you
[1:19:31] god's not a healer without you he's not
[1:19:33] a deliverer without you he's not a
[1:19:35] savior
[1:19:39] you're part of the word
[1:19:43] now you may look at yourself and with
[1:19:46] all your problems and all your mental
[1:19:48] things and all your weaknesses and all
[1:19:51] the way satan drags you around it seems
[1:19:55] but remember you're still part of him
[1:20:01] you've got that part
[1:20:04] your part just being a sinner was part
[1:20:06] of it
[1:20:11] just i mean that's beautiful to me
[1:20:14] because i was a sinner i was in a very
[1:20:16] very dark place
[1:20:19] i i i would really think if you could
[1:20:23] totally understand
[1:20:25] what a dark place i was in that you
[1:20:28] would really have to have a deep
[1:20:30] revelation of the power of the blood
[1:20:35] that's right
[1:20:36] of really what god
[1:20:38] is able to do
[1:20:40] for you
[1:20:42] and and from our side
[1:20:44] it is all about him
[1:20:46] because we can help ourselves
[1:20:49] we can't get out of ourselves
[1:20:53] it's very difficult to get out of
[1:20:55] yourself
[1:20:59] because everything you hear everything
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:02] you look at everything is is all comes
[1:21:04] through your senses and all comes
[1:21:07] through your feelings and all is
[1:21:09] filtered through your emotions
[1:21:11] there's so many things that you filter
[1:21:14] through that goes through all your
[1:21:15] feelings all your past experiences all
[1:21:18] your memories and everything and finally
[1:21:21] through all those things you draw a
[1:21:23] conclusion in your mind and that's where
[1:21:25] your battle is but this morning let's
[1:21:28] settle on one thing that god has the
[1:21:30] power to transform
[1:21:36] and that's what's beautiful
[1:21:39] and and so we see this great word here
[1:21:43] and
[1:21:44] and
[1:21:45] and the word never grows old so the
[1:21:48] revealed word
[1:21:52] is scripture made flesh and manifest
[1:21:57] and revealed or made known to us
[1:22:01] that's what the revealed word is is when
[1:22:04] what god wrote here
[1:22:08] is
[1:22:09] manifested it's scripture
[1:22:12] but it's scripture that's made
[1:22:15] manifest and made real
[1:22:18] and made flesh and made known to you
[1:22:22] look that's what the spirit of god
[1:22:26] does that's what god moves if i could
[1:22:28] say this all the prophecies that were
[1:22:31] written in the old testament the thing
[1:22:34] says the sun died times the diverse
[1:22:36] manners the spirit of god moved upon man
[1:22:39] well all those scriptures were laying
[1:22:41] there concerning me he said search the
[1:22:44] scriptures
[1:22:45] there were which testify of me
[1:22:49] but they were laying there in scripture
[1:22:51] form and they were reading them and they
[1:22:53] were chanting them in the temple and
[1:22:56] they were studying them they said that
[1:22:58] those scholars they could roll up those
[1:23:00] scrolls
[1:23:03] and stick a needle
[1:23:05] through them
[1:23:07] and they knew so much that word that
[1:23:10] they could tell you every word that the
[1:23:13] needle pierced
[1:23:16] that's knowing the letter
[1:23:21] well we have the privilege to know the
[1:23:24] author
[1:23:28] in other words the author has chosen a
[1:23:31] people
[1:23:32] amen that he's going to make himself
[1:23:36] known to
[1:23:39] another they can study or a person can
[1:23:41] study and say i believe this is what he
[1:23:44] wrote
[1:23:45] but when the author comes by
[1:23:49] and he tells you this is what i was
[1:23:51] talking about
[1:23:53] not only that he says
[1:23:55] i didn't write it to all those that are
[1:23:57] studying it i wrote it to you
[1:24:00] this is my love letter to you
[1:24:03] i'm going to show you what i meant i'm
[1:24:06] going to show you what i had in my mind
[1:24:09] i'm going to show you it's it's about
[1:24:11] you i did this for you i wrote about you
[1:24:16] i died for you i resurrected for you i
[1:24:20] go to prepare a place for
[1:24:22] you
[1:24:23] that you may be where i am also
[1:24:29] well there's you've got the the creator
[1:24:32] of heaven and earth living for you
[1:24:39] that's good
[1:24:41] if god be for you who can be against you
[1:24:46] i'd like to think that god's for me
[1:24:48] wouldn't you then against me
[1:24:51] how'd you like to walk out of here this
[1:24:52] morning god's against me
[1:24:57] why
[1:24:59] i wow
[1:25:03] if he ain't for me i'm toast
[1:25:07] i don't want to be toast
[1:25:09] i don't believe i am toast
[1:25:12] he said now
[1:25:13] and i can say this this morning and i
[1:25:16] hope that i can say this in a manner
[1:25:18] that is right
[1:25:20] he says but you know
[1:25:22] people say that oh you follow a man
[1:25:27] and can i say this you know we don't
[1:25:29] follow brother branham as a man
[1:25:33] we don't follow paul as a man
[1:25:37] but the way they follow christ the word
[1:25:40] we follow them in that
[1:25:43] way
[1:25:45] we thought fall be followers of me as i
[1:25:48] am a follower of christ
[1:25:52] of the word
[1:25:54] so the the things that are
[1:25:57] are are
[1:25:58] were spoken
[1:26:01] that the messenger came and spoke
[1:26:04] you know someone says i follow the
[1:26:06] teachings of william brown well maybe
[1:26:09] some people do follow the teachings of
[1:26:12] william branham but i've come to
[1:26:15] understand that it wasn't the teachings
[1:26:17] of william branham it was the word of
[1:26:20] god that he came to reveal to us
[1:26:25] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:26:28] and forever
[1:26:30] and so that we find that that
[1:26:33] that the word remains true in itself
[1:26:38] as eternal word amen
[1:26:42] if if we could
[1:26:45] which we can't
[1:26:47] but if we could take brother madam
[1:26:49] totally out of the picture
[1:26:52] and just have the sermons there
[1:26:58] you know
[1:26:59] it would be just like having the
[1:27:01] epistles of paul there
[1:27:07] things that you could read
[1:27:10] things that could be said
[1:27:12] and
[1:27:13] and so
[1:27:15] another word so the the word remains
[1:27:18] true what was taught was the word of god
[1:27:22] and that remains eternally true because
[1:27:26] it was from the beginning
[1:27:29] it wasn't something new even the seals
[1:27:32] themselves he thought i thought were
[1:27:34] written outside the book he says no they
[1:27:36] were contained within the book
[1:27:39] but they were
[1:27:44] hiding what you can establish in your
[1:27:48] heart
[1:27:50] without
[1:27:52] denying the respect
[1:27:55] and the position of the prophet
[1:28:00] not that you can separate it
[1:28:03] the message from the prophet but when
[1:28:05] you can come to the realization that the
[1:28:08] message is the word
[1:28:10] it's the eternal word that was in the
[1:28:13] beginning we're not following the giver
[1:28:15] of the word we're following the word
[1:28:18] itself
[1:28:23] you read your bible
[1:28:26] right
[1:28:27] now paul's gone
[1:28:32] i didn't know paul after the flesh
[1:28:38] that's right
[1:28:40] but i know the word that paul
[1:28:42] brought
[1:28:47] and who he was talking about
[1:28:49] and who he was showing
[1:28:51] and the life that he was talking about i
[1:28:54] know that to be the word
[1:28:59] so paul wasn't saying follow me
[1:29:03] after the flesh
[1:29:06] we'd all be tent makers
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:12] we'd all be sitting in some sailboat
[1:29:16] you can't follow someone after the flesh
[1:29:20] i'm more of a fisherman
[1:29:23] then i am a hunter
[1:29:26] if i tried to follow our our messenger
[1:29:29] after the flesh
[1:29:30] and then and we all went through that
[1:29:33] for a season where we all drove a
[1:29:35] forward and we all tried to wear cowboy
[1:29:38] boots and we all went out and bought
[1:29:41] you know i did it all
[1:29:44] i've got a remington you know 721
[1:29:48] you know just like brother branham's gun
[1:29:51] and and someone told me how brother bram
[1:29:54] climbed the fence and
[1:29:56] boy a climate bench just the way i can't
[1:29:58] climb a fence waiver around confidence i
[1:30:00] crawl underneath him now
[1:30:03] right
[1:30:05] it's not about following after the flesh
[1:30:07] it's about coming to the revelation that
[1:30:10] what he preached was the eternal word of
[1:30:12] god
[1:30:14] that's what we're following we're
[1:30:15] following christ jesus revealed in word
[1:30:18] form that through the revelation of the
[1:30:21] word form that we might come to know him
[1:30:24] personally
[1:30:28] because the word's what reveals his
[1:30:30] attributes
[1:30:32] and when we know his attributes then we
[1:30:34] then we desire to become like him and to
[1:30:38] have that nature
[1:30:43] but it's not we didn't know you know i
[1:30:45] didn't know uh brother branham's gone
[1:30:48] i didn't know brother branham after the
[1:30:50] flesh
[1:30:52] but i know the word
[1:30:56] that they preached
[1:30:59] because the word is the lord jesus
[1:31:01] christ
[1:31:02] made manifest
[1:31:05] so we we know that
[1:31:08] so we know that about the word
[1:31:10] and then when you can have confidence
[1:31:14] you know really
[1:31:19] what this is
[1:31:21] it's not a pamphlet
[1:31:24] that's right you know
[1:31:26] it it may be all that in the letter but
[1:31:30] in it
[1:31:32] is the eternal
[1:31:35] word of god
[1:31:37] that's who we're following we're
[1:31:39] following the lord jesus christ as he
[1:31:42] revealed himself
[1:31:44] in this day
[1:31:48] no i don't believe you can do away with
[1:31:50] the word
[1:31:51] amen
[1:31:53] the holy spirit didn't even come to
[1:31:55] speak of itself
[1:31:58] but it came to bring us into remembrance
[1:32:01] of all things that he said
[1:32:05] so don't ever let anybody ever
[1:32:09] make you feel
[1:32:12] like by believing this message that
[1:32:16] you're following a man
[1:32:18] or you're fallen you're not
[1:32:21] that was the lord jesus christ in our
[1:32:23] day
[1:32:24] bringing to us
[1:32:26] the true word of god and we'll just
[1:32:29] touch on it in a second here he says now
[1:32:31] let's go to this word this word
[1:32:33] transformed i looked it up in the
[1:32:36] dictionary yesterday when i
[1:32:38] lost track of time
[1:32:41] that i was to be up here and when i was
[1:32:43] looking for a text i found this word
[1:32:46] and this text rather scripture
[1:32:48] and the dictionary says that it's
[1:32:51] something
[1:32:52] that's changed
[1:32:57] amen
[1:33:00] how many somethings that have been
[1:33:03] changed are sitting in here today
[1:33:08] you think if he changed you this far
[1:33:11] that he can't change you all the way
[1:33:15] when he told us if i started working you
[1:33:18] i will finish it till the end
[1:33:23] amen
[1:33:25] he don't quit
[1:33:30] in fact we even read that
[1:33:32] didn't he say that uh
[1:33:34] uh
[1:33:37] there's someone walking outside do we
[1:33:38] know who that is down the side of the
[1:33:40] church
[1:33:42] uh
[1:33:43] the uh
[1:33:45] he says that quitters never win
[1:33:48] and winners never quit
[1:33:50] oh is he a winner
[1:33:52] right he ain't gonna quit
[1:33:55] i would have hate to seen
[1:33:58] what would have been like if paul tried
[1:33:59] to get back up on that horse
[1:34:07] he says it's words keep me in something
[1:34:09] that's changed
[1:34:11] it's to be changed transformed
[1:34:15] made different than it was it its
[1:34:19] character
[1:34:21] and everything
[1:34:22] has been changed in it
[1:34:25] it's been
[1:34:26] transformed
[1:34:29] now that's what we're talking about this
[1:34:31] morning we're talking about god's power
[1:34:34] to
[1:34:36] transform
[1:34:38] his power to change things
[1:34:42] no matter where you are in your life
[1:34:44] what you're looking at what you're
[1:34:45] facing
[1:34:47] what circumstances you find yourselves
[1:34:50] in you can't forget that god's got the
[1:34:53] power
[1:34:54] to transform that
[1:34:56] he's got the power of change the world
[1:35:00] don't have the power of change
[1:35:05] and they go people when the psychologist
[1:35:08] they want the psychiatrist they run the
[1:35:11] doctors and we all do that i'm not
[1:35:14] saying there's anything wrong with that
[1:35:16] we we go to do this we go to loan
[1:35:19] officers we go to banks we
[1:35:22] uh we go for financial help because
[1:35:25] we're
[1:35:26] we're working the best we can
[1:35:29] to change the
[1:35:31] circumstances around us
[1:35:36] you got an old clunker and
[1:35:39] it won't start and you finally come to
[1:35:41] the place this has got to change
[1:35:45] this is not reliable
[1:35:48] and so we'll go out and we'll go to a
[1:35:51] dealer and he'll sell us an overpriced
[1:35:54] vehicle
[1:35:55] and
[1:35:56] we'll make the payment
[1:35:58] well and and that's fine so we change
[1:36:02] things
[1:36:03] but we've still always got to remember
[1:36:07] that god has the power to change things
[1:36:11] anywhere
[1:36:12] anytime
[1:36:14] any place
[1:36:15] anything god's got the power to
[1:36:18] transform
[1:36:20] never give up on that never lose vision
[1:36:23] of that he can change something anytime
[1:36:26] he wants to change it
[1:36:30] he's a creator
[1:36:34] and
[1:36:38] he says that's the transforming power of
[1:36:40] god
[1:36:41] that can take something that's nothing
[1:36:45] and make something wonderful out of it
[1:36:48] god's transforming power
[1:36:50] and we know that's what he did he moved
[1:36:53] upon the earth didn't he the earth
[1:36:55] without form and without void and he
[1:36:58] transformed it
[1:37:02] and we know he planted seed in it that's
[1:37:06] right
[1:37:07] and he did all these great things that
[1:37:09] he did in in in in working and and and
[1:37:14] planning and
[1:37:16] and it says in the 44th
[1:37:19] paragraph he says therefore he created
[1:37:22] by his word
[1:37:25] he sent his word
[1:37:27] so all the seed that he had placed upon
[1:37:32] the earth
[1:37:33] he formed those seeds by his own word
[1:37:41] now we're leading to something right
[1:37:44] so how did how did he change the face of
[1:37:48] the earth
[1:37:50] by his spoken word amen
[1:37:53] and how did he change it by he planted
[1:37:55] seed in it
[1:37:58] by his word
[1:38:00] he put the he put the
[1:38:02] he put this seed there he seed he placed
[1:38:06] upon the earth he formed those seeds by
[1:38:09] his own word
[1:38:10] for there was no nothing else to make
[1:38:14] the seed out of he had placed them
[1:38:18] and they were
[1:38:20] beneath the water
[1:38:22] and he said let
[1:38:25] there be this
[1:38:27] and let there be that what was he doing
[1:38:31] he was transforming amen
[1:38:34] you say how is god going to transform me
[1:38:38] by his word
[1:38:41] let it be a perfect bride
[1:38:44] let it be without spot or wrinkle
[1:38:47] let it be without blemish
[1:38:50] let the peace of god surpass
[1:38:52] understanding let her have joy
[1:38:55] unspeakable and full of glory do you
[1:38:58] understand he spoke all these things of
[1:39:01] you
[1:39:02] amen
[1:39:03] all these things that have been spoken
[1:39:05] of his church
[1:39:07] she'll be an elect lady to amen the
[1:39:10] works that i do shall she do also
[1:39:13] look those things are spoken of us
[1:39:15] they're laying there
[1:39:17] in seed form
[1:39:20] and because he he he preached it and and
[1:39:24] every one of those seeds
[1:39:27] is going to come forth yes sir amen
[1:39:32] all the promises of god are laying in us
[1:39:36] in seed form amen
[1:39:41] oh
[1:39:42] and
[1:39:43] and
[1:39:44] we struggle
[1:39:48] we see a promise out there
[1:39:50] and we never look at that promise is
[1:39:53] being what we are
[1:39:55] we looking at something that we got to
[1:39:57] obtain
[1:39:58] or we got to go find or we got to get
[1:40:02] well that way we're trying to transform
[1:40:04] it but god's got the power to transform
[1:40:09] that seed into the life that it was
[1:40:12] intended for the promise of healing was
[1:40:16] given to you by god for you amen
[1:40:21] to be healed
[1:40:25] when you get sick
[1:40:31] it's all about you
[1:40:33] you are the attributes of god
[1:40:36] you are the word of god
[1:40:39] you are the seed of god
[1:40:42] now god's got the trance the power to
[1:40:45] transform that
[1:40:48] because he placed that seed in you and
[1:40:49] that seed's got everything in it that
[1:40:51] you need to be
[1:40:53] and i'll just read this and we're gonna
[1:40:55] i'm gonna
[1:40:56] skip most of this and just say what i
[1:40:59] have on my heart
[1:41:02] the first man was this is paragraph 47
[1:41:04] we'll read this quickly
[1:41:06] the first man was in the image of god
[1:41:10] which is spirit
[1:41:13] john 4 says god is a spirit and they
[1:41:16] that worship him must worship him in
[1:41:19] spirit and truth
[1:41:21] that's paragraph 47.
[1:41:25] i hope our screen and paragraphs are the
[1:41:27] same as by book
[1:41:32] but god is the spirit
[1:41:35] and the first man that he created was
[1:41:38] spirit man
[1:41:40] he was in the image
[1:41:42] and in the likeness of god
[1:41:45] so
[1:41:45] when we say
[1:41:47] that he was made in the image and
[1:41:49] likeness of god
[1:41:52] we
[1:41:54] we keep looking at the flesh
[1:41:58] but the image and likeness of god was
[1:42:01] that god was a spirit
[1:42:03] so when he made man in his image and
[1:42:05] likeness he was spirit but he didn't
[1:42:08] have flesh
[1:42:12] okay
[1:42:13] you don't take it beyond exactly what it
[1:42:17] says from the beginning god was the
[1:42:19] spirit
[1:42:22] right
[1:42:23] so when he made man he made him a spirit
[1:42:26] man that's right
[1:42:29] it's just like you you you you have this
[1:42:31] consciousness inside of you right of
[1:42:35] your life
[1:42:37] of your feelings your emotions
[1:42:39] everything you are your spirit what you
[1:42:42] enjoy you have a spirit man in your
[1:42:44] flesh
[1:42:45] and you know you have flesh when you hit
[1:42:47] your finger with a hammer
[1:42:51] now your flesh and your spirit are
[1:42:54] certainly divided at that moment
[1:42:57] because your spirit starts screaming out
[1:43:00] it's your flesh
[1:43:05] how many times have you done something
[1:43:06] he says oh that was stupid oh you stupid
[1:43:08] person talking about yourself
[1:43:13] you can cut your finger off you can lose
[1:43:16] a part of your body
[1:43:18] but if that's what you were then
[1:43:20] you wouldn't be whole anymore but you're
[1:43:22] still hole in your spirit
[1:43:24] so man was a spirit
[1:43:27] the image of god was spirit
[1:43:31] and he said
[1:43:33] like god and he
[1:43:35] and then he put this man in flesh
[1:43:40] and man fell
[1:43:42] so then god came down
[1:43:45] and became in the image of man
[1:43:49] that he might redeem that fallen man
[1:43:54] that's the real gospel story to my
[1:43:57] opinion
[1:43:59] god made his flesh we fell he became
[1:44:02] flesh that he could redeem us
[1:44:08] redeem us
[1:44:10] again
[1:44:11] it's about
[1:44:13] you
[1:44:14] now god in god in 6 000 years he planted
[1:44:18] all these wonderful seeds
[1:44:22] or he had spoken his word it shall be
[1:44:25] this way it shall be that way
[1:44:28] it shall be everything was perfect it
[1:44:32] was just good
[1:44:33] and he commanded each one of those seeds
[1:44:36] that they would
[1:44:39] that they would be they would transform
[1:44:42] themselves
[1:44:43] into the plant
[1:44:45] of which kind of life
[1:44:48] that the word of god had spoken in them
[1:44:52] should be
[1:44:53] if it was an oak tree
[1:44:56] it was to bring forth an oak if it was a
[1:44:59] palm it was to bring forth
[1:45:02] a palm
[1:45:03] he commanded them all to bring forth
[1:45:07] what he put in them amen
[1:45:11] what happens this morning if we could
[1:45:13] hear the command of god
[1:45:17] to bring forth in us
[1:45:21] what he planted us to be
[1:45:26] may i just jump way ahead of myself but
[1:45:28] this message was the command of god
[1:45:32] to the bride to come forth and be what
[1:45:35] he planted her to be
[1:45:42] because the great creator had just sent
[1:45:45] forth
[1:45:47] his word and the word seed was there
[1:45:51] before the real seed was ever formed
[1:45:55] and the word form seed he made the world
[1:45:59] out of things that does not appear
[1:46:02] he made the world by his word
[1:46:05] god spoke everything into existence
[1:46:10] so if he made the world out of nothing
[1:46:13] by his word
[1:46:15] what's he going to make you out of
[1:46:17] hallelujah
[1:46:20] what's he going to make this bride out
[1:46:23] of
[1:46:23] not by our efforts
[1:46:27] not by mine
[1:46:29] not by strength but by my spirit saith
[1:46:33] the lord he's going to make this church
[1:46:37] this
[1:46:39] unspotted
[1:46:40] unwrinkled
[1:46:42] elect lady bride he's going to make her
[1:46:46] out of his word amen
[1:46:49] that's what he's going to make her out
[1:46:51] of
[1:46:54] because that's the way he always does
[1:46:56] everything
[1:46:58] so in all your weakness that you're
[1:47:01] sitting in this morning all your
[1:47:03] failures all your doubts all your mental
[1:47:05] battles everything that you're in
[1:47:07] everything you can look in the mirror
[1:47:09] everything that your body's doing
[1:47:11] against your spirit because the spirit
[1:47:14] wars against the flesh and the flesh
[1:47:16] wars against the spirit god's still
[1:47:18] gonna perform his word by his word
[1:47:24] he's going to bring you forth
[1:47:28] by his word now i'm going to finish with
[1:47:30] this because there's so much more
[1:47:33] that we want to go into but we can
[1:47:36] always
[1:47:37] go into it
[1:47:39] another time
[1:47:41] he said everything is under control to
[1:47:44] bring forth of its kind
[1:47:46] now remember to bring
[1:47:48] when he put the seed on the earth the
[1:47:50] seed can only come forth with the power
[1:47:53] of life within it
[1:47:55] to transform it from seed to a plant
[1:48:01] whatever it was
[1:48:03] his transforming power god put the seed
[1:48:06] in there
[1:48:07] with potential that it would be what he
[1:48:11] said it would be
[1:48:13] as long as it stayed in its right
[1:48:16] category
[1:48:20] it would be exactly what god said it
[1:48:23] would be
[1:48:24] it'd have to be that way because he made
[1:48:28] it that way
[1:48:29] and made a channel
[1:48:31] that anything that stays in his channel
[1:48:35] in his line of word
[1:48:38] it will have to bring forth exactly like
[1:48:41] the word said it would do
[1:48:44] it cannot move from there
[1:48:47] it's channeled just exactly right
[1:48:51] so with everything in the trust of his
[1:48:54] own son
[1:48:56] that it would be that way
[1:48:59] then god said it's all good
[1:49:02] so i'll just rest and each of those
[1:49:04] seeds has power in itself to transform
[1:49:08] itself into the species that i desired
[1:49:12] it to be
[1:49:13] that's what it must
[1:49:16] be
[1:49:19] because i've given
[1:49:21] every seed transforming power
[1:49:24] to make out of itself its potential now
[1:49:28] to make out of itself exactly what i
[1:49:32] want it to be
[1:49:33] god has never changed
[1:49:36] there's the same thing today
[1:49:38] as he was then god is determined to do
[1:49:41] something he'll do it and nothing is
[1:49:44] going to stop him he'll do it
[1:49:47] now just think everything's laying there
[1:49:50] right and then here comes the enemy
[1:49:55] and what is the enemy
[1:49:57] he's a deformer
[1:50:01] first of all he deforms even adam and
[1:50:04] the purpose that they were
[1:50:06] he he changes the he he changes the
[1:50:10] whole face of the plan of god but yet
[1:50:13] god's still going to keep his word amen
[1:50:16] now this morning
[1:50:19] god's never changed his his purpose
[1:50:23] about
[1:50:24] about us
[1:50:28] right he's never changed that it's still
[1:50:31] the same
[1:50:32] he says now it's hard to say this
[1:50:35] this is paragraph 77 very hard because
[1:50:38] speaking to people who feel the same way
[1:50:41] i do
[1:50:42] the way that i've been for many years
[1:50:45] since the opening of the seven seals
[1:50:48] of the angels behind the mountain yonder
[1:50:52] this has become a new book
[1:50:56] it's the thing that's been hid
[1:50:59] is being revealed as god promised in
[1:51:03] revelations 10.
[1:51:05] he would do it
[1:51:07] now there was a purpose for him doing it
[1:51:12] now remember he said what was the
[1:51:14] purpose of god doing it you're the
[1:51:17] purpose that god was doing it you're the
[1:51:20] reason the seals were open amen
[1:51:25] you're the reason the word of god was
[1:51:28] made known
[1:51:32] there was a reason that the son of
[1:51:35] perdition
[1:51:37] was
[1:51:38] revealed
[1:51:39] in our day
[1:51:41] he said
[1:51:43] he would do it and we are the
[1:51:46] privileged people
[1:51:49] that god has chosen
[1:51:51] of the earth
[1:51:53] that we might see and understand these
[1:51:57] things
[1:51:59] which is not some mystical
[1:52:02] fleshly mind of a person
[1:52:06] trying to make it up
[1:52:09] it's the word of god made manifest
[1:52:13] proven that it's right
[1:52:16] proven not by science
[1:52:19] but by god is that right
[1:52:22] god as i have said before in a message
[1:52:26] god doesn't need anyone to interpret his
[1:52:30] word
[1:52:30] he's his own interpreter
[1:52:34] he says it'll happen it happens
[1:52:38] he
[1:52:38] confirms it then interprets it
[1:52:42] now
[1:52:43] so this book became a new book
[1:52:47] now
[1:52:48] why
[1:52:52] there had to be
[1:52:55] something
[1:52:56] great that
[1:52:58] that was going on so all of a sudden so
[1:53:01] god's mindful of us
[1:53:03] right so what happened satan started
[1:53:06] spraying the church
[1:53:10] with education
[1:53:12] he's going to deform the church
[1:53:14] he wants her for a bride
[1:53:17] satan wants to marry you
[1:53:22] he wants you to be
[1:53:24] his bride he wants you to produce his
[1:53:27] children
[1:53:28] he wants you to serve
[1:53:31] what he thinks important
[1:53:34] he wants you to be part of his economy
[1:53:38] but that's not the seed that god planted
[1:53:41] you to be
[1:53:46] that's not he's got to
[1:53:49] he
[1:53:49] he he's got to make you
[1:53:53] be the seed that you are
[1:53:58] you can't make it
[1:53:59] it's in there
[1:54:02] but it's got to be brought to life
[1:54:07] it's got to get back in the channel
[1:54:11] if it gets back in the channel
[1:54:14] it'll produce
[1:54:16] if it's out of the channel it produces
[1:54:19] something that's hybrid something that's
[1:54:22] misformed not something that looks like
[1:54:25] it it would be so close it would deceive
[1:54:29] the very elect
[1:54:31] but it wasn't the original
[1:54:35] purpose
[1:54:37] think of it
[1:54:39] god's mindful of you again he says it
[1:54:42] this way i'm so glad that god is mindful
[1:54:45] of us again
[1:54:47] that he can still move upon the face of
[1:54:50] the conditions he promised he would do
[1:54:53] it
[1:54:55] and call a little flock which would be
[1:54:58] his bride
[1:55:02] notice here now how perfect the church
[1:55:05] types of these
[1:55:07] edens
[1:55:08] god through the seed of his word
[1:55:11] and there is only one thing that can
[1:55:13] quicken the word and that's the spirit
[1:55:16] if it's the life giver
[1:55:19] to the word
[1:55:21] and when the life
[1:55:22] in the word
[1:55:24] meeks the life of the spirit it produces
[1:55:28] whatever the seed is
[1:55:32] so
[1:55:33] what what showed up in this day
[1:55:38] what was the ministry of malachi 4 5
[1:55:42] luke 17 30.
[1:55:45] it was the life
[1:55:48] the nature
[1:55:49] took the spirit
[1:55:51] of the word amen meant the promised word
[1:55:55] of the day who did it meet
[1:55:58] it meant you
[1:56:03] who was a reveal to it was revealed to
[1:56:06] you i don't care what kind of rest you
[1:56:09] are
[1:56:16] i was not i thought i was a christian
[1:56:22] but i was a member of the first church
[1:56:24] of david mcgeary
[1:56:31] i read a little interesting story it
[1:56:33] kind of struck me
[1:56:35] along these lines not to make a joke
[1:56:38] but
[1:56:40] a mother came in and found her children
[1:56:42] my grandchildren and my kids would play
[1:56:45] church
[1:56:46] i remember aaron would get my suit coat
[1:56:48] on and set up a box and he'd preach
[1:56:51] and the other brothers and sisters would
[1:56:53] all shout amen and
[1:56:56] just carrying on that's what they did
[1:56:58] they played church
[1:57:00] and so the little the little uh boy was
[1:57:03] uh reading
[1:57:05] his bible to the cat
[1:57:10] and and so the mother saw me he'd do
[1:57:13] that couple days and then one day he'd
[1:57:15] come out and he found the boy with a the
[1:57:18] cat and he was dunking them in in the in
[1:57:22] water and that the mother said well
[1:57:27] cats don't
[1:57:28] like water and the little boy said well
[1:57:30] then he shouldn't have joined my church
[1:57:39] right
[1:57:41] well if we don't like the word of god we
[1:57:43] might as well not come part of this
[1:57:45] message
[1:57:50] is
[1:57:51] is the way
[1:57:54] that god's going to transform
[1:57:57] his church
[1:57:58] into the bride because the spirit of it
[1:58:05] right
[1:58:06] the spirit of the word which was in the
[1:58:09] beginning descended put his foot on the
[1:58:12] land and the sea veiled himself can the
[1:58:15] prophet ministry that that ministry
[1:58:18] could meet the seed
[1:58:24] and when it meant the seed
[1:58:27] now god has the power
[1:58:30] to transform
[1:58:33] that seed
[1:58:36] into what that he intended it to be
[1:58:42] from the beginning
[1:58:46] and and it it's it it's just
[1:58:51] exactly
[1:58:52] you know we're
[1:58:54] we're still sons and daughters of god
[1:58:58] i don't know i had that mark but
[1:59:01] he said
[1:59:03] well but we have never lost that we're
[1:59:05] still sons and daughters of god we're
[1:59:07] still exactly what god intended us to be
[1:59:09] in the beginning but satan has sprayed
[1:59:12] us
[1:59:15] with science
[1:59:17] with education
[1:59:20] with uh
[1:59:22] with uh
[1:59:25] religion
[1:59:26] all these things he he sprayed us with
[1:59:29] and he's he he's placed on us and after
[1:59:33] he's he's frayed us with all these
[1:59:35] things uh uh
[1:59:37] uh and
[1:59:40] all these things that don't have
[1:59:42] anything to do with god
[1:59:47] the enemy
[1:59:49] now how is he going to get it off of us
[1:59:55] by renewing our minds
[1:59:57] by the washing of the water
[2:00:00] of the word
[2:00:03] you've got
[2:00:05] problems
[2:00:06] you've got habits
[2:00:09] start
[2:00:10] washing in the word
[2:00:15] start reading your bible
[2:00:19] don't sit there
[2:00:21] and carry a mind battle
[2:00:24] on in your mind
[2:00:26] with all the hope that i'm going to
[2:00:28] overcome all the hope i'm not going to
[2:00:31] do this again
[2:00:33] gathering up all your mustard
[2:00:36] and all your strength and saying i i
[2:00:39] refuse i i'm not gonna i'm done with the
[2:00:42] cowboys
[2:00:46] till next season
[2:00:49] until they win their first game
[2:00:52] then super bowl
[2:00:55] and you're right back in it
[2:00:59] that that's not how it works
[2:01:04] i hope i can express this to you this
[2:01:06] morning
[2:01:08] you can't bring the seed to life in you
[2:01:12] it's got to meet the word
[2:01:18] it's got to get in the channel if it
[2:01:21] meets the word
[2:01:23] then the word is what brings it to life
[2:01:27] and starts turning it into what it's
[2:01:30] supposed to be
[2:01:34] you can have all kinds of weaknesses
[2:01:37] you can smoke
[2:01:39] you can drink
[2:01:44] i remember i believe it was brother bud
[2:01:46] thought with giving the testimony
[2:01:49] help he he got up and said i got to go
[2:01:51] check on the horses
[2:01:53] and
[2:01:54] and uh
[2:01:55] he he went out but he still smoked
[2:01:59] whenever he were probably still smoked
[2:02:00] he's rubber bands guide
[2:02:03] he was out there smoking you know
[2:02:05] because he smoked
[2:02:07] and he come back by the tent and
[2:02:09] and creeping in everybody's crying all
[2:02:11] of a sudden i heard this voice out of
[2:02:13] the tent brother bud when did you quit
[2:02:15] smoking
[2:02:20] just now
[2:02:23] what happened
[2:02:25] he meant the spirit amen of the word he
[2:02:28] meant the nature of the word he meant
[2:02:31] the person of the word where was that
[2:02:34] nature
[2:02:36] and that person
[2:02:38] where is he
[2:02:40] he's in the word
[2:02:42] he's not in your imagination
[2:02:46] he's not in your program he's not in
[2:02:49] your plan
[2:02:51] if you've got if you're shackled by lust
[2:02:53] if you're shackled by envy if you're
[2:02:55] shackled by any of the things that was
[2:02:58] never your original channel that was
[2:03:01] never your original condition satan
[2:03:04] sprayed that on you
[2:03:06] who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:03:09] god's elect
[2:03:12] satan sprayed that on us all
[2:03:16] all of us all of us were sons and
[2:03:18] daughters of god
[2:03:19] to all of us
[2:03:20] were elected that that never
[2:03:23] that's never changed you know what i
[2:03:25] mean but
[2:03:26] uh
[2:03:28] he
[2:03:30] i just had that such a beautiful quote
[2:03:34] that brother branham
[2:03:36] said
[2:03:37] he he said you're still the sons and
[2:03:40] daughters of god it's just that satan
[2:03:42] has deformed you
[2:03:45] he said listen to this
[2:03:47] and
[2:03:48] this paragraph 69 and
[2:03:51] we are
[2:03:52] all still
[2:03:54] in the image of god
[2:03:56] but some are so deformed
[2:03:59] as sons of god
[2:04:02] they walk contrary to his word
[2:04:06] and to his ways
[2:04:08] that he had just provided for us to walk
[2:04:12] setting something the world twisted us
[2:04:15] out of the way
[2:04:17] pulls us close to it
[2:04:20] and away from the straight narrow
[2:04:25] strip that he planted
[2:04:27] in us
[2:04:29] in us
[2:04:30] us in
[2:04:31] to be sons and daughters of god sin has
[2:04:34] done this evil thing to the sons and
[2:04:37] daughters of god
[2:04:41] so satan sprayed those things
[2:04:43] and so
[2:04:45] again just summing up this morning to
[2:04:47] what i'm trying to say it's our desire
[2:04:50] to come into the nature of god
[2:04:54] it's our it's our desire to be christian
[2:04:59] but we've got all this spray on us
[2:05:07] we've got all this
[2:05:09] stuff
[2:05:12] that's put on us that wasn't
[2:05:14] really
[2:05:16] meant for the sons and daughters of god
[2:05:19] i can't talk
[2:05:21] god's mindful of us
[2:05:25] so if i could say this
[2:05:27] when he he brought the word back to us
[2:05:30] because the words the only thing that
[2:05:33] can renew our minds and wash us and
[2:05:37] cleanse us
[2:05:39] so what i'm trying to say this morning
[2:05:41] is if you want to overcome
[2:05:44] yes sir
[2:05:46] don't create a program for yourself
[2:05:50] god's got a program for you start
[2:05:54] washing
[2:05:58] what happens when you spill coffee on
[2:06:00] you leslie come home the other day says
[2:06:04] i'm full of coffee just fill the whole
[2:06:06] thing of coffee all over gotta go in and
[2:06:08] wash
[2:06:09] taking a shower what
[2:06:12] she said i was trying to blame it on
[2:06:14] evan but i did it
[2:06:18] no me blame it
[2:06:21] if you get if you're dirty you don't
[2:06:23] have to worry how you got dirty
[2:06:27] the answer's the same amount
[2:06:31] it's not what you overcome it's how you
[2:06:34] overcome it
[2:06:37] and as simple as this is
[2:06:41] if you will start washing
[2:06:45] in
[2:06:46] the water of the word
[2:06:49] it will cleanse you
[2:06:53] you might not see immediate results but
[2:06:56] if you keep washing
[2:06:58] and keep washing
[2:07:01] keep reading keep listening
[2:07:04] keep getting in
[2:07:05] every time you're doing it that spirit's
[2:07:08] starting to make contact with the seed
[2:07:11] that's in you
[2:07:13] it's god's power
[2:07:16] to make the change
[2:07:20] but he has a way he does it
[2:07:24] he does it by his word
[2:07:28] the change comes by his word
[2:07:31] so if you make contact with the word
[2:07:34] you're making contact with chains
[2:07:39] it'll work
[2:07:40] amen
[2:07:42] it'll work that's right
[2:07:44] no matter how defeated you are put on a
[2:07:47] tape
[2:07:48] read your bible
[2:07:50] get a book
[2:07:52] kneel down and pray
[2:07:54] take the word of god start washing with
[2:07:57] the word of god and you can't wash
[2:08:01] in used water
[2:08:04] and get clean
[2:08:08] when justification came
[2:08:11] it washed off all that catholic
[2:08:14] candle stuff
[2:08:16] and all that stuff
[2:08:19] that said man had to do penance and all
[2:08:22] this work all that stuff was in that
[2:08:25] water
[2:08:26] that justification washed off
[2:08:29] you can't get clean with that water
[2:08:34] it won't cleanse you of the dirt
[2:08:36] of today
[2:08:38] it won't cleanse you with what satan's
[2:08:41] trying to spray on us today
[2:08:44] in our news in our schools
[2:08:47] what things they're teaching
[2:08:52] you can't you can't
[2:08:54] wash yourself
[2:08:56] with water that's been used
[2:08:59] when sanctification came it washed all
[2:09:02] those things of all that dirt that was
[2:09:05] there
[2:09:06] from justification it's been cleansing
[2:09:09] the church the word of god's been moving
[2:09:11] up through the ages
[2:09:14] you can't wash in that water
[2:09:17] and get clean
[2:09:18] you can't walk in pentecost
[2:09:23] in the restoration of the gifts
[2:09:27] established in those things that won't
[2:09:30] clean you anymore
[2:09:32] that water did its washing
[2:09:36] but he's given us water to wash in
[2:09:40] amen
[2:09:42] that's what he provided because he's
[2:09:44] mindful of you he wants to cleanse you
[2:09:48] by the washing of the word of god so he
[2:09:50] provided the water he provided the wash
[2:09:53] for you you've got boy trouble
[2:09:56] give him the word of god prophet of god
[2:09:58] put it this way take the word put on the
[2:10:01] thinking man's filter it'll wash that
[2:10:03] stuff out of you

[2:10:12] like he likes you and you start
[2:10:14] fluttering all off be careful
[2:10:18] same thing with you boys just don't look
[2:10:20] upon the pearls on the outside
[2:10:25] because if god tarries
[2:10:29] yeah someone said well what are you
[2:10:31] worried about if god carries
[2:10:34] this message will just be something in
[2:10:36] history it'll never be history
[2:10:38] it'll never grow old it's the word it's
[2:10:41] still true it'll always be true just
[2:10:43] like everything paul said is true
[2:10:46] everything that shows the word of god
[2:10:49] it's there to wash
[2:10:51] it's what's going to bring you into the
[2:10:53] nature of god it's what's going to bring
[2:10:55] you into the
[2:10:57] don't turn it into religion
[2:11:00] use it
[2:11:02] for what it's intended to do
[2:11:05] to cleanse you
[2:11:06] and make you free of blemishes and to
[2:11:09] present you
[2:11:12] a glorious church
[2:11:15] remember all this is here for you
[2:11:20] for you to become
[2:11:23] the bride for you to overcome
[2:11:27] for you to be victorious
[2:11:30] your his workmanship
[2:11:34] foreordained in christ jesus
[2:11:37] works
[2:11:39] that you should walk into um
[2:11:42] and when you think of it this morning
[2:11:45] he he got the power to transform but
[2:11:48] he's got a way he does it and it's by
[2:11:52] his word so if that seed will come forth
[2:11:57] if it gets into the right channel
[2:12:01] so if you get yourself into the channel
[2:12:04] of the word that word will start washing
[2:12:07] all the devil spray off of you
[2:12:12] think that's a problem some of us just
[2:12:14] need to take a shower
[2:12:18] in god's word
[2:12:19] it'll wash all the devil spray off of
[2:12:21] you
[2:12:22] it'll start making contact
[2:12:26] with that
[2:12:27] predestinated life of that seed
[2:12:30] and that seed will start becoming what
[2:12:34] that it's predestinated to become
[2:12:37] but you can't take the word out of the
[2:12:41] picture
[2:12:47] you can't take the word that sent
[2:12:53] to do it
[2:12:54] out of the picture
[2:12:57] that's what he gave this to you for
[2:13:03] to transform you
[2:13:06] it ain't just believing it
[2:13:10] it ain't recognizes the truth
[2:13:15] i could give you a bar of dove soap
[2:13:20] and you could set it in your bathroom in
[2:13:22] the box
[2:13:23] and say that's soap
[2:13:26] that's dove soap that's spiritual self
[2:13:31] the dove represents the spirit
[2:13:35] and you'll still stink
[2:13:42] you've got to take it out
[2:13:45] and you've got to get in the water
[2:13:48] how many have ever just taken a bar of
[2:13:50] soap and just rubbed it on you and
[2:13:52] thought you was clean
[2:13:55] i bet you everybody in here cleans with
[2:13:58] water
[2:14:01] that's what water does
[2:14:04] it cleans you
[2:14:06] the washing of the water of the word
[2:14:09] cleanses you
[2:14:11] makes you clean brings you back to what
[2:14:14] that you are
[2:14:17] and he's got the power to do it
[2:14:23] you take that word god's got the power
[2:14:26] to change you
[2:14:28] it's in the word
[2:14:31] the power to change you the power to
[2:14:33] transform the power to take the new
[2:14:36] heavens
[2:14:37] and the and all the earth and turn it
[2:14:40] into what it is he's got the power to do
[2:14:43] that and that's why he's come he's come
[2:14:46] with the power to bring this bride back
[2:14:50] to what she's intended to be
[2:14:52] by the washing of the word he's mindful
[2:14:55] of us again
[2:14:57] and i i love this and i'm going to close
[2:14:59] with this little statement that you
[2:15:01] could stand as as we closed this morning
[2:15:05] and so we can be dismissed i went longer
[2:15:07] in what i

[2:15:33] that word
[2:15:34] and made a boat to float

[2:16:00] to transform you
[2:16:02] from the ground
[2:16:04] to the sky
[2:16:06] you want to overcome
[2:16:08] you got habits

[2:16:20] go get in the word
[2:16:23] read your bible
[2:16:26] listen to the word of god let it wash
[2:16:29] you
[2:16:30] let it transform you
[2:16:32] there's power in the word
[2:16:35] to change the whole face of the earth
[2:16:38] you don't think there's power in the
[2:16:40] word to transform you
[2:16:43] there's a lot of things about me i don't
[2:16:45] like
[2:16:46] but i've got a place
[2:16:48] that i can run
[2:16:50] that'll change them
[2:16:52] let us bow our heads this morning and
[2:16:54] ask yourself in your heart
[2:16:59] are there things about
[2:17:01] yourself that you would like changed
[2:17:08] maybe frustration
[2:17:17] maybe just something that
[2:17:20] you just can't shake
[2:17:27] maybe something you love maybe a program
[2:17:29] maybe a song
[2:17:32] maybe a sport no matter what it is
[2:17:38] and it wasn't whether i think it's okay
[2:17:41] or somebody else thinks it's okay it's
[2:17:43] what do you feel
[2:17:45] in your heart
[2:17:48] [Music]
[2:17:50] all things are lawful for me but all
[2:17:52] things aren't expedient
[2:17:57] there's something in your life this
[2:17:59] morning and you say lord i'd like this
[2:18:01] to be changed
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:09] he's speaking back to you and say my son
[2:18:12] my daughter
[2:18:14] if you'll come to my word
[2:18:20] i will give you revelation
[2:18:25] and transformation
[2:18:27] for your deliverance
[2:18:30] i'll give you faith
[2:18:32] to overcome
[2:18:34] [Music]
[2:18:36] but faith cometh by hearing
[2:18:39] and hearing by the word of god
[2:18:42] i've sent and vindicated my word to you
[2:18:46] that you could take it
[2:18:50] and you could wash the spray of the
[2:18:52] devil
[2:18:54] off of you
[2:18:56] that you could drink it
[2:18:58] and it would be transforming power to
[2:19:01] transform you
[2:19:03] into the son and daughter of god that i
[2:19:05] predestinated you to be
[2:19:10] lord i know it's hid in simplicity this
[2:19:13] morning
[2:19:15] i know i don't have the vocabulary or
[2:19:18] the gift to
[2:19:20] expound on it
[2:19:23] and make it so clear

[2:19:31] in this day and brought the word the
[2:19:34] transforming spoken word
[2:19:40] and we're privileged
[2:19:43] that you've done it
[2:19:46] and we realized that you've done it so
[2:19:48] that i could become the bride that i'm
[2:19:51] predestinated to be
[2:19:53] father may i take your provided way
[2:19:57] the washing of the word
[2:20:00] may i not make up my own religion
[2:20:03] but may i take the washing of the water
[2:20:05] of the word this morning
[2:20:08] to cleanse me
[2:20:09] and make me be
