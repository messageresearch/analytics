[Music] when all things pass around shadows [Music] [Music] oh [Music] shadows [Music] you is [Music] hallelujah what a reason to live this morning to just worship him and praise him and all our lives to just be about him amen amen that's just about heads and this morning and pray our gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your presence lord and father we hear lord that ship of your pasture lord and inviting you this morning that you may come and take the service into your hands and lord and from the song to the preaching of the word lord we like to hear from you this morning lord and our heart penitent after you father we pray that you may speak to our hearts we love you and invite you this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you i want to welcome everyone in the house of god this morning all our visitors who certainly welcome you we're invited by the mic for so i'm reading this morning amen god bless you we're going to go ahead and continue in psalm 119 this morning if you want to go ahead and turn there we'll be picking up in verse 89 reading that kind of that portion this morning and as i was looking over that this week that first verse really caught my attention and it says simply this forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven think about that what a statement thy word is settled forever amen you know i was thinking about that statement when we say that something is settled there's something final about that you know there's no question it ends all question there's no debate it's done as we sing in that song it's already done you know i just was looking in webster's dictionary listen even to the words that webster's dictionary uses to describe settled it says to make quiet or orderly to establish or secure permanently to fix or resolve conclusively to arrange in a desired position to come to rest ms webster but look at those words rest quiet in order in position established secured arranged positioned fixed resolved forever oh lord thy word is settled in heaven you know i began to ask myself then then why do i worry why do i worry about the outcome of my circumstance of any circumstance of any situation why do i feel like i have to put my hands on things to try to change or to say something to try to affect thy word is settled in heaven do i need to help it is it settled or no you know jesus when he was speaking on the sermon on the mount when was teaching his disciples how to pray he said in matthew 6 10 he said thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven we know that his will is his word that's what we've been taught you know so if it's already settled in heaven then all we need is to see that manifest in the earth in this earth you know our prayer might be instead of i hope it goes this way or may it go this way or can you solve my problem or can you meet my need be it unto me according to thy word the word is already settled in heaven you know how many times did jesus say be not afraid only believe it's really just a question of whether this earth can get aligned with the word that's already settled in heaven where we get hung up where i get hung up is where i forget that that word is already settled regarding any circumstance and that i need to put some work to it you know be it unto me according to thy word let it be done in earth as it is in heaven you know the question is do we know what the word has declared and said about it and are we willing do we believe that ultimately this earth will match what's spoken and settled in heaven you know the portion of the psalm the last verse 96 david's observation is i have seen an end of all perfection you know what that means is the most perfect plans and efforts and creations of man the best we can do the best we can build the best we can think the best we can plan all comes to an end but thy commandment is exceeding broad that means there's no end to it i can't find the borders i can't find the edges you know so as we read this portion of the psalm this morning we're just going to read those eight verses verse 89 and 96 just you know as a reminder to me that everything we see in this earth is just things being positioned to match what's already settled in heaven in my prayer for myself is be it unto me according to thy word heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall not let's read that portion of scripture this morning starting in verse 89 forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven thy faithfulness is unto all generations thou hast established the earth and it abideth they continue this day according to thine ordinances for all are thy servants unless thy law had been my delights i should then have perished in mine affliction i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou hast quickened me i am nine save me for i have sought thy precepts the wicked have waited for me to destroy me but i will consider thy testimonies i have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandment is exceeding broad amen amen god bless you may be seated amen why don't we sing here bye to your advice this morning amen [Music] oh i'm rejoicing night and day as i

this morning as we move into the wonderful presence of god's word it's nice to have our special guests with us ben and jenna i guess last sunday wasn't the last time god is so good to me preach man brother shelley so nice to have you this morning and wonderful presence of the lord with us ben you always bless me when you sing i hope your pathways at least it's a 50 50 isn't it 50 here at 50 in alabama is that good brother you go for that thank you my brother your smiles your smile tells it all right amen do you love god's work you know our whole existence is based on what was done for us in calvary that one great sacrifice for sin set so many of us free and there's only one place that god meets a man and that's under the shed blood you couldn't dance in the spirit you couldn't lift your hand if there wasn't a blood sacrifice that was laid and when this man died all our sins were remitted and there's no more consciousness of sin and it's so wonderful and that love there's a song that we're going to sing when we invite brother george this morning here is love vast as the ocean loving kindness as a flood when the prince of life a ransom shed for us his precious blood let's never forget it what a wonderful thing that is done so as we sing this this morning brother billy will help me sing remember that you're not approaching him this morning on your own merits you're not approaching him because you have anything to offer you're approaching him because he has a blood covering that you can walk up in the presence of that blood and that's what he sees he sees a forgiven sinner you see he doesn't see what's been thrown in the sea of god's forgetfulness that blood gives us equal access this morning to that throne so whatever request you have on your heart whatever desire that you ask god to do it's been purchased for you this great love that we sing about this morning as we invite our brother to come [Music] the [Music] [Applause] ocean think of it [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] mercy [Music] is [Music] [Music] forgotten through our [Music] says [Music] is yourself [Music] throughout the day [Music] the reason that song is so special to me is because that is the song that characterized the welsh revival it was less than a year started in 1904 ended in somewhere in 1905 because one man fell on his face before god we need revival and god blessed that island people went from here over there where is it where is it looking for some big fantastic thing it was in the individual when that song was sung over there in their language people fell to their knees in the streets the bar rooms closed look it up wells revival brother roberts such a beautiful song let's sing this first verse again and just realize that our song only believed but that was the song then it caused great things over there here is a love [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] thank you very much while you're standing take your bibles and open to proverbs chapter 3. we're going to have sunday school this morning and i know that everybody came hungry and you should always bring your bible because you never know when the screen might fail you it's electronic proverbs chapter 3 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and truth for sake bind them about thy neck write them about the heart about the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and all the things you think you could figure out in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to be here in texas today lord we have people here from many different places many countries many languages many customs thank you for the translators we pray that you bless them the lord there's one thing that is the covering for all of us that's the blood of jesus christ and here in the 21st century we are under the umbrella of the malachi 4 message that you have sent and vindicated and proved to be of god father we thank you for this opportunity we love brother david and just don't take this very lightly but know that it's a serious time serious situation and we just pray that you would bless your word to your people let each one understand exactly what you're trying to say to them help us in jesus name amen you may be seated we greet all of you in the name of jesus christ and um knowing that all things work together for good it doesn't stop there that's a comma for those that are called according to his purpose and those who love god and if you love god you love all his word amen so this morning we're going to speak to you on a subject the time is now it's not yesterday it's not when brother branham it's now now is the time and so i want you all also to turn over to matthew chapter 24 yeah don't put your bibles away we're in church it's going to get serious here in a little bit yeah guess what i brought the level it's got two or three purposes i'll let you guess what they are matthew chapter 24 and verse 1 jesus is um with the disciples they have left the tail they're walking away from the temple now it says and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him and showed him the great buildings of the temple look how marvelous all what you know herod has done so marvelous jesus said you see not you see all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon the other that shall not be thrown down they didn't want to hear that they're proud of their temple he just took all the air out of their balloon and as he sat on the mount of olives that's 600 yards away now they're over the mount of olives looking at the temple the disciples came into him privately just just them in the master tell us just tell us privately when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered i see sometimes the answer is exactly what you want to hear but we're serving a god that can see all things all time he knows all your circumstances where you came from and why you're here what's the attraction on central avenue in bedford it's not personality it's the word of god so jesus said to them take heed in other words listen up people that no man deceive you what's that got to do with the questions lots for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many many are going to walk away because they paid attention to the wrong voice okay now go over to verse 23. then if any man shall say unto you oh here's christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i told you it's coming you're already warned watch out in another translation it says verse 23-25 then if any man should say to you behold here's the christ or there do not believe it for there shall arise false christs and lying prophets and they shall show great signs and wonders so as to mislead if possible even the chosen ones behold i've told you in advance now quiet people don't scare me a bit that means you're listening and i don't know when i'm coming back so listen up so the level is here for a reason is to remind us to stay balanced now we had a fantastic supper last night and i tried to hold back and stay balanced but i saw some other guys they were they were headed this way you know we must stay balanced and what we eat what we say our whole operation is to stay balanced here today and especially those of you watching from the comfort of your home we've got people that they can't get in here we've got four chairs here but there's people watching you need to stay balanced also and pay attention to what we're saying okay so we're living in very dangerous times of church history now we think that we're in marvelous times because you know we all have our little magic thing here that in touch with anybody in the world and find out any facts any anything the whole world in your hand you don't have to worry about tv anymore it's right here but it's a deception be careful and so we have every kind of distraction every kind of deception and we want to know how to identify the dangers how to stay clear of them and stay balanced okay now this has another purpose those of you that were here last time don't be trying to fall asleep buddy because if i see anybody dozing off it's not my fault that you stayed up late last night and we don't have a coffee bar here but if i see anybody dozing off i can buy another one of these you know so revelations 19 turn your bibles so that you know we're not pulling funny stuff on your hair revelations 19 verse 7 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her that's you not some angels no to god's bride to his wife to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the linen for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints that is coming very soon maybe tomorrow maybe friday i don't know but very very soon okay but in the meantime today right here in your daily life here in texas wherever you're from 2022 there will arise false christ now we spent a lot of time preaching on positive promises and building the faith of the people and getting things you know pushed forward but i've got news for you there's some negative promises in the bible that are equally equal weight and they will come to pass whether you like it or not we got to take all the word when we go to the buffet we don't just take the chocolate pie no you got to take all of it you got to be right you got to be balanced you see so there will rise false christ that's anointed ones very anointed and cause others to believe yeah and lying prophets don't sound good does it because we know about one prophet well there's lying prophets also so they don't all speak the oracles of god with pure heart and mind in order to help god's people no that's not the intention of some people you see and they the anointed ones and the lying prophets and preachers will show signs and great wonders great explanations great opinions so as with the intention of misleading if possible even the chosen ones so the time is now now in revelation 7 we have where the scriptures talk about the hundred and forty four thousand jews that sounds like a lot of people but it's not in israel today there's probably well yeah in israel there's about nine million jews there's more than that in new york they're in atlanta and cincinnati and dallas and everywhere so 144 000 is just a small portion of the whole deal it says right there in revelation 7 of the tribes of israel we don't have to guess who they are so there's not going to be one more and one less there won't be any empty chairs no the perfect package you see and god is watching over his heritage now in the natural very few people know what tribe they're from okay there's some that do many don't but god does he's got a computer that doesn't crashes he's got he's got a laptop it's always ready you know and um he's in total control of all the details of their life and of our life see you and so there's a great anticipation amongst the jews even today yes i've been there i know some of these people and they will the ones that are serious they'll tell you oh the messiah is almost here but first we'll see elijah they've been taught about elijah since they were born so they know what kind of what to look for they're ahead of us we didn't know nothing about elijah you can see anyway so it's about to happen and then when we focus closely we are a many-membered body i mean just right here we've got languages we've got colors we've got everything you see people called out of the confusion of laodicea for his name's sake not to shine well i'm so and so no for his namesake okay to show a living christ to a dying generation okay and then but see god in his great wisdom and his foreknowledge he has predestinated a certain number called the bribe okay redeemed by the blood of the lamb and that's why when you uh you know you get all excited you want to testify to a neighbor or whoever and they reject it they're not part of the program not everybody's going not everybody carrying king james bible is going either i hate to tell you but there's there's three kinds of believers sitting right here and don't worry about who the other one is who are you so this bride we don't know how many people it is see with the jews we know exactly the number the number with the bride we don't have a clue it's a lot uh by comparison but we don't know the exact number but there won't be any extra chairs i kind of squeeze you know 14 people in a bench that holds 10 people no there's a seat for every one of us amen so do just do your part to be there so the exact number only god knows many are listening some are you know in other words they're having church from canada all the way to the south pole right now in europe africa they're already kind of getting ready for the evening service in india they've already let out it's night time so god is in control of all these things okay so we're living in very dangerous times you can read history you can look at some movies and so forth and thank god that you are living now it could be a lot worse but god has trusted you with his word to live in the darkest part of laodicea and overcome the demons of this age because when we get to heaven so i don't know who you know i'd like to think that that in this crowd of 300 people or made us here that there's only one unbeliever and one make believer i don't know i want to believe we're all going you see and when we get there if they hand out t-shirts we don't know but if they hand out t-shirts it's not going to be you know survivor it's going to be overcomer we are overcomers of dark laodicea and we are more than overcomers see when there's a fight only one winner right he gets the big buckle and he gets the big check so he's the overcomer but when he gives his wife the check she's more than overcomer and we are the wife okay so yes very dangerous times and um god has us living here by his grace in this time of church history we're not building an ark we're not walking across the desert we're looking for the exit of laodicea and yes there will be overcomers now 2700 years ago a jewish prophet named isaiah said behold the darkness shall cover the earth future tense and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee speaking of dark laodicea the time is now so we are now in one of our darkest hours i hate to give you the bad news but it's facts and it's from matthew 24 24 and other scriptures are coming into focus you see and um it's uh it's a time for that fulfillment it's not with the pentecostals mormons followers of martin luther whatever know they're right here amongst us our friends our loved ones carrying these same prophetic manuscripts carrying the same king james bible no none of us is going to be swayed by some explanation out there no it's going to be right amongst us so how dark is it well and you know you've heard me speak before so don't fall asleep it's going to get interesting here a little bit um a long time ago 1959. um brother bran was preaching in the islands of the caribbean and he had some americans with him and he was there two or three weeks and so one day one of the americans had a four hour interview with him and you know many years later he's telling us about it and so he asked brother brown why do you say so much about 1977 okay first of all all you math geniuses that was 18 years in the future okay we agree so brother ramon could have said it's none of your business but that wasn't the way he operated no he said well when i was looking into the stream of time so he's looking at numbers he said it got to 1977 it was so dark i didn't see how any believer could live in such darkness that's why now we've lived i mean there's people here born a long time after 77. and so now we're 45 years this side of that dark time 45 years darker 45 years more corrupt 45 years more subtle it's only used three times in scripture always to do with deceit and sinful activity so we're 45 years closer to the catching away of the bride the secret catching away we're not going to go out in a blaze of glory okay secret catching away so stay ready because you don't know what time i don't care what they tell you and oh this date forget it i've heard those things for 50 years yeah this date and that day and those guys they drift off you know no we're watching for the secret coming okay and after the secret coming of the lord after the secret catching away there are people there'll be people right here in this church having service thinking they're serving god and every church all these baptist churches they'll all continue having church but the ministry like me and a few of my friends that's when we can retire okay so they're going to say well what happened to those crazy people you know strange people following that guy they said was a prophet but never seen again so as a redeemed and anointed bride of christ god has provided us with this bible okay this is very very important it used to be a crime to carry a bible they burned people alive or even thinking about translating it we have it everybody's got one or two you know and so it's in our language and we have the the privilege that we can read between the lines but before you get too excited and go off on your tangent what you read between the lines has to be in perfect harmony with what's on the line has to be in harmony he's provided us with a uh prophetic ministry yeah god sent gift of unquestionable accuracy no wondering no guessing i wonder why no it worked and it's real but back to the bible one more time you know brother branham was very careful about his bible because this is god in printed form and when he would travel that would be the last thing in the suitcase so there's not a bunch of stuff on top of it okay and he says you look it up he says you don't ever put anything on top of your bible not even my books he said which at the time there weren't too many books so be careful and when i see somebody putting songbook on top of their bible we might use this as a weapon i got a big one out in the car but we have this ministry god has provided and it's it's real simple only believe you don't have to memorize the whole book of matthew or whatever no only believe real simple the angel of god came from the throne of god and he says to william branham you get the people to believe you nothing will stand in the way of your prayer and he's using a man that can barely read when he started out his girlfriend would come up here honey read this right here and then he would preach yeah is that best that's god's choice look at the 12 disciples is that the best we could find that's god's choice so we don't have an opinion in it you see so never put anything on top of god's word okay so yeah it's only believe and it's totally scriptural um but you know with every move of god there's twins from the garden of eden till today there's a twin shows up with negative comments negative attitudes and so the best thing you can do with those people when you read or hear about them leave them alone it's just like the people out here on 183 when they kind of just have it all fine just drop back let them have it this is the only millennium they're going to have it's not going to get no better for them we're going to a better place so these people that are constantly throwing rocks our message leave them alone right so he's provided us with all the instructions we need to walk right into the body change or prepare us for resurrection and it's very very close i don't have any personal insight i'm just telling you about what i see it's close okay so there's some sitting here that won't see death some are going to go by the way the grave like the brother this week and many others we've heard about recently but there's some here that will not see death but a sweep will come over just like a breeze and all of a sudden wow that black hair again wow no spots it's going to happen people it's not walt disney it's real you see and then what will happen then we'll hear a knock on the door and there's grandma there's rebecca there's the ones that are gone and then we're changed you see so the day of the lord will be in full effect it's on the way that's when the minister of god can retire the first day of the resurrection so the redeemed of the lord are focused on that day that's where we're headed you know we wish we could just drop everything but no you got to occupy until he comes and so we're looking towards that day the day of our full redemption we are focused and keeping in step with god's word walking in the light that you have because each one of us you know christians in progress or each one have a little bit different light you know maybe 10 watt maybe 20 100 watt we walk in the light that we have and we want to maintain a balance as we move along now in acts chapter 3 open your bibles again we are mentioned in acts chapter 3. where is it at here and verse 21 3 21 um 3 20 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive or like it says in spanish keep back until the times of restitution of all things which god has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began so there's included in that restoration of all things is the bride we're being restored not just to the day of pentecost but to eden and that that's going on now that's why you're here today what can we do we're looking in the mirror of the word how do we get uh ready a little better so rest of all restoration of all things includes the bride restore her to her original condition as we were in the mind of god before he formed the planets now see we we live here we have cars we have freeways got all this stuff but have you if you looked at the pictures i mean this ball is sitting in the middle of the air now there's some really really demented people on the planet that think that the planet is flat that's ridiculous yeah the flat earth society they had a uh what we call one of their conventions three or four years ago and they invited a uh astronaut to come speak now the astronauts been out there he saw this round ball that should have been interesting so we have this ball sitting here in the air it goes around just perfectly you know east is back here west there north star is right out there never moves and the ball is right there and it moves and every day you know so before all that happened we were in the mind of god okay and that's why we press forward with successful missionary work that is bearing fruit the word is going into places i can never go it's going people are are taking the memory stick with the message and they're playing and people are being baptized it's going on right now there's a there's an active search for that last one you see and so god is calling people to repentance calling them to baptism we just dealt with the case last night how do i become baptized real simple come to church we'll tell you about it but we read in the love letter that that special day will be preceded by a falling away from the truth all this seems to be going fine and we're headed to that you know the destination but before we get there there's going to be a falling away things are going to fall apart in some cases you see and so a falling away from the faith apostasy or rebellion so any departure any apostasy or rebellion must always begin from the inside you see and goes out and takes as many with them along the way so that kind of activity never begins way out there no it comes from within it's very subtle and engaging and very dangerous and don't you dare think that you can do battle with them those are the devil's enemies those devils you know his lieutenants enemies of the truth and you're gonna waste your time trying to do battle doesn't work you're no match for the devil because of you you know so much and you've read your whole bible and all this fine we don't have any business in that battle over there leave them alone you see and you can't argue them with your logic so the love letter also tells us over here in matthew chapter 12. matthew 12 and um 32 see what we got here if i was one of those real good preachers i'd have all this by memory said and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him in other words jesus is saying right here in red letters you guys can do anything say anything you want against me i'll forgive you no problem but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come we've got people in pulpits right now in america with this same bible speaking evil of what god has done they're just digging their hole deeper every day so so it's extremely dangerous in revelations 22 18 you take one word out put one word in you're finished uh what is hebrews 6 if you've been here you've partaken and you've memorized part of and you've preached it whatever and then you go away it's a one-way trip there's no way back so we love the word of god others do not it's just that simple now jesus had to put up with some of the same stuff 2000 years ago matthew um 22 is where it says they then went the pharisees now before you get too excited the pharisees were the best religious people of the time okay it's just a warning they knew their prophet's words they had a a bible ended in malachi that was their bible it was a 200 year old translation so it was more friendly to them at that time they had it by memory they didn't have ipad and iphone no they read and memorized they knew their prophets words but they were blinded for our sake thank you and so when jesus comes along in fulfillment of these words they memorized they just couldn't see it so they went and took counsel they got together how we might entangle him in his words you know trap him with a question we still have pharisees today you see and just like those back there today we have people that know the letter quite well but zero revelation you see if the message of god is not real to you today in your soul you will walk away one day and we'll hear about it you can't sneak away we'll hear about it but to turn your back on the truth one you must misunderstood and you must misunderstand and reject the bible promises okay you gotta misunderstand and get scrambled so the people that are walking away and yeah wayne brown one day they're going to leave the bible also they're going to be at zero you have to reject the supernatural indication yeah this photo we got over here that's a supernatural photograph i've seen the original in washington and i've talked to the man that took the picture over here in houston he's gone now so it's real but people speak against it so they're on a slippery slope and according to hebrew 6 that person is left with zero chances of returning because see god is the judge not me not you we are only fruit inspectors you see we have an inspector badge issued by the holy ghost you know when you go to the market you're going to buy peaches well now there's some you don't don't don't even want to touch them because they're already soft so you're inspecting the fruit okay this one will be good or avocados after all you know 300 other people squeeze them we're just fruit inspectors and we don't have to touch it we have to say word just back away so god is in charge he's the judge now in john chapter 8 we have a scene that jesus went to the temple ground now when the when the scripture says he went to the temple the temple is small about maybe half the size of this but the people all gathered out there in the yard that's where the people were so he's over there in the corner of the courtyard with you know a group of people and it's early church he's sitting there teaching a crowd of believers and all of a sudden who shows up but the twin twin always shows up never misses opportunity so here's a group of very arrogant pharisees all men and they got a woman by the arm i mean they got a death grip on her arm and they drug her out of bed so she's not dressed right her hair is not combed or nothing and um and they interrupt him wow we got him now he's over there with those people and we'll drag this prostitute over here so they put her right in the middle you know right where everybody could see and they posed a loaded question and they probably each one had a few rocks in their pocket ready to perform what the prophet said to do kill his sorry outfit with a rock you know yeah they were ready and uh ready to judge and so um because their the pharisees job was to make jesus look bad okay and uh let's see where we at john chapter 8 and let's see here in verse 4 and they said unto master this woman was taken in adultery we drug her out of the bed i mean so it says now our prophet moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned what do you say are you are you willing to contradict our prophet moses but see they were only half right moses said bring both of them so this could have been a setup they didn't bring the guy you know and so they're trying to make him look bad he acts like he doesn't hear him he goes over there and starts scribbling writing in the sand we don't know what he wrote it's not important you know and so they're going to continue with her with her accusation and um and uh they thought he was down there looking for a rock yeah and um to help him fulfill the law you know words literal words of their prophet and so when they finish their accusation he he raises up he heard everything and he looked around and tell you what boys the one of you that has never stole a pita bread you never looked at a woman with any kind of bad thoughts of any kind the one that's free from sin throw the first rock of course nobody qualified so the scripture says they start tiptoeing out we didn't think about that let's get out of here you know and so jesus had these things you know and he goes down and continues writing but then he erased it all now we've got to put that in because we've got people so narrow-minded they think that the showbread is still over there someplace we can go see it they think we can go there and see where jesus wrote in the sand how many 2 000 years have passed things change you know they've had 25 wars so they they started to just get away by discernment he was able to see her entire life okay just a flash and he could see that she had representation in heaven now yes she had been on a detour we don't know how long or why but she had representation in heaven he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more once again a woman received life from the life giver okay it turned her into a real lady her heart filled with joy she went away with hope to live a new life that was where she had her encounter with the master her chains fell off she was free romans chapter 8 says here hold on romans 8 one of my favorite chapters no i didn't memorize it therefore is is therefore there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who have believed all the word who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so she had this representation you see so that's a nice story now what about you have you had your personal encounter or is it just your mother's story and grandma's experience you know it's got to be real you see god can he sees all your circumstances he knows all your story and he can change your life you see for his glory but it's got to be real in your life in your in your own self not in grandma and not your mother and so forth but we still have pharisees today we call them legalists you see so those people in jesus day had their prophet's message memorized perfectly but they were out of balance really out of balance now we're not going to put it all the way this way because see this way is the long part of the cross that's your prayer life you want to get close to god you pray you read your bible come to church okay but if you maintain your prayer life god will take care of the horizontal okay moving that along so they had all word no spirit no revelation and they had memorized it by constant repetition it became a form you know and they still do it today because from way back there way back every sabbath that's yesterday every synagogue on the planet reads a part of moses they have their spoken word book yeah they read the eye we're all together that's called organized religion not interested okay so we must worship god in spirit and in truth see that's what he told the woman at the well we god is looking for those who are worshipping in spirit and in truth perfectly balanced you see so your life will reflect what's on the inside of you you can't you can't deceive a four-year-old they can see right through you you know and so your life will reflect what's on the inside no matter how much word you memorize and try to act like a christian because anybody up and down this avenue can read and repeat that's not what it's about it's about it coming alive okay turn over to first timothy chapter four i might not get invited back for a while so we've got to get it all out today where's that here first timothy chapter four and verse 1 now the spirit speaks expressly that means precisely that in the latter times that's today now is the time that some shall depart from the faith they were in the faith we thought they were tight they left giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron sounds pretty bad doesn't it the lambza bible says misleading spirits and doctrines of devils where scofield says seducing spirits well yeah misleading spirits you know doctrines of devils so it's very serious you better know where you stand and having done all stand do not engage in conversation with doubters those that don't believe what we believe leave them alone you're not going to change them now your life is what you got to watch you see a lot of people you know a lot a lot of women they don't know why they have long hair or why they wear long dresses but it's word of god you know so you act like a christian you be a christian if there's something in them to wonder they'll ask and you kind of have an answer so yeah we are in very uh very difficult times no conversation with doubters negative people see that was the fatal mistake that mother eve made and she listened and then she responded really are you serious she got involved tried to argue and we're still paying the price today spirits don't die okay back in your bible second peter chapter one one thing i want to tell you about peter peter was ignorant and unlearned he couldn't read he couldn't write well how did all this happen because he had some people helping him he had some good people helping him yeah that's the way i want to say yeah and so they eventually come up with these two letters okay where are we at first peter ii peter chapter 1 let's see chapter 1 and verse 15. moreover i will endeavor that she may be able after mighty cease to have these things always in remembrance in other words he prepared all this because he knew he was going to die and i want you to you know have what i have why for we have not followed cunningly devised fables now see that's not just something another opinion no cunningly devised fables something to mislead by by design you see when we made a note unto you the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ but we are eyewitnesses of his majesty he knew what he was talking about he was ignorant and unlearned but he got with some brothers and one of them was an age named sylvanius i think and they they got his thoughts on the paper and we have it here and that's why it's very important many some of you might not like it but we have a church age book yeah that's the message in a nutshell there's what he wanted to say brother ram never allowed any of his message to go out verbatim you know word for word he wanted it sanded he wanted it presentable so these things may sound fantastic maybe impossible to comprehend but it's all truth it's food for the soul and so there in in second peter or first peter where we're at we'll go back just a minute second peter we were in um chapter 1 and verse 16. so look at 17 and 18. for he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice from him excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount yeah he was he was a witness see i'm not an entertainer but i am a witness of a powerful message it is real okay uh jesus said over in john 6 53 verily verily i say unto you and he's talking to his disciples he's given him the the real important part here chapter six if you do not eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you well their first impression oh my god no not eat his flesh no whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day now the disciples at that moment were kind of concerned they're a little bit confused but they stood steady they knew this man came from god they knew this was a supernatural ministry they didn't get in his face with stupid questions like we have today no they paid attention did they understand no they didn't understand but they were ordained to eternal life chosen by the lamb of god they stood steady believing that he knew what he was talking about and they believed the supernatural they had seen the unquestionable vindication now brother branham was sent to us with a very simple verse what was it something everybody could understand now in one of my bibles over here in hebrews 11 hebrews 13 there's a semicolon after verse 7. verse 7 of hebrews 13. remember them which have the rule over you so there's order who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation which would be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in other words they're living what they speak this verse doesn't just stand out there's a rubber stamp for everything it has to do with the whole chapter and that's to do with the way we act the way we carry on our conversation so he was totally vindicated no question or doubt only believe it works yeah just just try it you know i remember one day he he uh he told me he said now george tithing does work i have tried it and you know that it works so there's these things in the bible that are real you just got to put them to practice so the day of redemption is very near now there's two things we want to point out here also about uh jesus and his day you know the first miracle was the wedding at cana remember he got a he and the disciples he had an invitation go to this wedding it's a little village of galilee and so they go over there and there's this mother and you know crowd of believers and so they ran out of wine remember the story now look at the details in your bible read your bible the wedding was on the third day okay sunday is the first day monday is the second day tuesday's the third day why do they have weddings on the third day because in the book of genesis in the creation on the first day god said it's good second day that's good but on the third day he said good twice so the jews take tuesday for our favorite day to get married anyway so he's there they ran out of wine and they go here you may want to do whatever he says and so i had these big water pots you know they're huge maybe bigger than those drums and he said well first thing we're going to do is fill these six pots here with water okay whatever you say now taste it now this wasn't hours later it was immediate wow that's good stuff should have had this the beginning and so he created wine from water now in jeffersonville many years ago one of the believers at the tabernacle lived next door to a man named mr hill mr hill belonged to the church of christ called and so the brother whatever his name was he was always hey come on church with me you know well finally mr hill says fine i'll go church with you tonight well it just happened to be communion night so there's open communion and there's closed communion closed communion is just us we shut the door it's just us but open communion if you say you're a believer sure if you if you lied what's going to be on you it's not on me and so they have open communion and so they um uh they stand at the rail and they come by with the bread and the next guy comes by with the wine okay so they're a little over half done with the congregation and brother neville says to brother branham uh brother branham we're out of wine well it's kind of embarrassing so mr hill he's right there where he could see it you know hear it so brother bran says well i'll tell you what we'll just pray it's a great idea so you know the bible says watch and pray so mr hill he got one eye open and he's he said i saw those little glasses filled with wine as he prayed from nothing so he couldn't go back to church christ he became a believer so the redemption the day of redemption is very near okay how far it's close just take my word for it when when we the believers the redeemed find that last eagle that's how we got this missionary here from uh africa good friend of mine from many years ago we were both young and good looking way back brother jim and there's there's work going on that you don't hear about but it's going on searching searching and when we find god's last eagle you see so god's program is right on schedule and by the way his schedule doesn't really include handing out tracks at the mall and to stop light no that's not it no passing out literature is not preaching the gospel it's a kind of a hobby maybe but you want to get serious about what he said new ministry 1959 god knew that we'd be sitting here 10 million years before the world was ever founded when there was nothing no planets we were already the mind of god and he knew you'd be sitting here and so he says the infinite sea of god knew every fly every gnat so we could add the cockroaches and the mosquitoes all these things and every time each one would bat their eye and how much title that would produce before the world was ever formed that's the infinite god we serve and so he says here well if he knows all that why are you preaching because see you you can get out of balance with with uh predestination oh we'll just we'll just sit down why do we go through all this stuff just sit down let it happen no that's not the way it works if god knows all that why are you preaching it's part of god's program preaching is his program want to say what he said you're on when he looked at the disciples or the apostles see there's a difference apostles is one thing disciples are followers so these were these were disciples following the lord but then they became apostles sent out missionaries he looked at the harvest he said you know the harvest is ripe the labors are few you all need to pray to the heart lord of the harvest that he will send laborers into his harvest well why would they have to pray to the lord of the harvest to send laborers into the harvest if the lord of the harvest was standing there knowing how it would be done great question he says listen god has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and i this church out here isn't going to raise automatically it's got to be a group effort so he's so arranged that his program cannot move without you and i as long as we're not doing what god leads us to do we're paralyzing his program but when the church moves under the anointing of the holy ghost then we're in god's will doing his program so preaching is his program no more argument whose program god's program the god of heaven and earth not my program not david's program god's program so we would do very well to put our little program aside you see and get in line and in step with his divine program because god sent his fourth elijah to this generation according to the divine plan to turn the hearts back to the original this glorious message that we have is the vehicle that takes us back okay the first church age messenger said over here in first corinthians 3 for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building according to the grace of god which is given unto me as the wise master builder i have laid the foundation see he knew who he was i've laid the foundation and another one builds their own but let every man take heed how he builds thereon for other foundation can no man lay than that which is already laid which is jesus christ and that's why the fifth messenger martin luther came along in the midst of a lot of stuff he said christ alone very important so who are these laborers together in the first sentence look real close in your bible 41 pages later in ephesians chapter 4 you got permission to open your bible where's it at here ephesians 4 poor paul being a very intelligent person he wrote one sentence okay starting in verse 11 it's one sentence and he gave some apostles some apostles some prophets some evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the son of god under the perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we the henceforth be no more children acting like children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine that comes by by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together perfectly and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love second time in case you missed it the first time so that's one sentence he was a smart man but it's the gospel all right there you see so why do we have these ministries for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ and they all work balanced and in harmony we don't have profit over here and evan's just over here and pastor no they work in harmony okay brother rem says over here in perseverance 1962 i believe that there's a church coming into that perfection now friends this was 60 years ago preaching to people that didn't consider there was no such thing as a bunch of believers there was pentecostal people he was preaching to some baptists in what water i believe there's a church coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection where the offices were apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church those pastors and teachers and so forth will be so in tune in balance with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the lord i believe that and i believe that we're nearing that time i believe it is so now is the time are you listening they all work in harmony and balance just like these musicians now you got you got three violins get the organ you got the piano you got the guy beating on the thing over here okay so they got to work together there's no very important oh it's all about me no you don't see that up here and the ministry works the same way you see uh under one anointing anointing of the word the spirit of god all others out there whoever that's out there that are out of balance with the word attracting people to themselves yeah in 2022 this wasn't 1950 but now they don't qualify under this this uh verse here because they're not they're not part of the team you see god is not responsible for their foolishness their tantrums and their explanations but individuals must appear on the scene to produce fulfillment each part of god's eternal word spoken by prophets yeah but the bible is ancient and we've got a man over in rome wants to write a new bible really ma that man is supposed to be wearing the sandals of the fishermen those of you that's catholics you know i'm talking about he's supposed to be walking in in in peter's footsteps and he can't even repeat the word right who's going to trust him with the new bible doesn't work we don't need a new bible no uh we may be smarter we may be better informed today we got better stuff greater buildings but way out of balance with god's program we've got to get back in balance in 1964 the prophet said if this all continues the way it is going right now in 50 years it'll be total insanity that circle was closed in 2014. so what you live in out there and work total insanity if you don't believe it try driving out there so that is why we see such horrible things happening in our world total insane people everywhere you see and he also says that it'll become spiritually insane because we live in pleasure mad laodicea you know and we want the thermostat just right we want the car just right everything got to be just right you know it's crazy and so we need to get away from our sense-bound existence you know search that phrase too sense-bound existence so recently in it about five years ago i think it was in a period of three years 138 students were shot dead in a three year period sounds bad too much tv too much make-believe but guess what during that same three-year period over six million babies were murdered by abortion yeah in the united states not talking about the world okay yeah right here so we have no business telling anybody on the planet how to run their country or advising on human rights we are some of the worst so our messenger was brave and he entertained questions from the audience and the questions and answers on the seals on a sunday morning says would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture good question sure that's what's going on right now the bride of christ certainly it is the message of the hour the bride of christ she consists of a bunch of ugly people no she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors he identified it it's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry great ministry it's the ministry of the hour it'll be so humble so a lot of people miss it and put it somewhere else now there's only two forces we're almost finished here we've got see there's no clock up here so too bad it'll all be there when you get there if you go to sleep we'll start over there's only two forces directing all the activities on the planet right now every one of you is listening or following a spirit in every activity every waking moment either following god or following satan it's just that plane a or b so we're free human beings we're free in this country to make choices and it's every moment of every day it's very serious but balance is not an option you must stay balanced because you start going just a little bit and it doesn't work you'll stay balanced brother brahm says you follow the scriptures see if the spirit follows the scripture any spirit that does not follow the scripture is a wrong spirit now he doesn't say to compare with personalities or whatever no scripture that's right if it goes beyond this bible it's wrong spirit if it doesn't get to it it's a wrong spirit you see so if the devil can't keep you from seeing a truth he'll push you overboard see that's his business he will go off uh that person will go off into something fantastic or he'll keep you from seeing it at all but to stay right straight on calvary it'll always come back straight back to the word stay balanced so the scripture says over in james 2 that demons believe and tremble just because you got ready and came to church and didn't go to the beach or wherever you know that's that's great but the devils they believe in tremble unfortunately we have people today carrying this same book same bible and so forth claim to believe they believe something but they're so calloused by sin and unbelief here in laodicea they don't know what the bible says or the booklets they carry and they don't cry and they don't tremble god has a provided way brother bran says friends i've always tried to keep a balance of the road you get way off on formalism just as formal and ritualistic as they can be people grab for that a lot then if you don't watch you'll get plumb over on the other side be just as fanatic as you can be but there's a middle of the road where the true sound sane gospel is preached and god moves there vindicating the truth straight as the gate narrows the way few that be to find it so consider this redeemed individuals are waiting on the coming of the lord that would be us and people around the world we're saved by grace believing and depending on the atonement of calvary only god has the list now remember we're only fruit inspectors we're not judges the bride members are paying attention to the ministry that god has placed in the body so neither you nor anybody else can take out what god has installed you see jesus said in matthew 20 12 32 one word against it you're finished be careful and number three the elect of god are it's a direct quote we are waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed if you were here 30 days ago when i was here we we spoke about that waiting in love not with a stick and not with you know no waiting in love for the promise of the age to be confirmed she's watching for it she is part of that word and she's watching for her life not all these people her life to manifest that word but we're still see we're up here getting towards the top of the pyramid we're in the age of perfection and we're looking oh yeah you need to what are you doing you know no look at yourself am i ready to go hebrews 11 all these having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god provided a better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect god had to have a people that he could trust with a revelation of his word you see so they're waiting for us we hold the key they're waiting for us to get in line getting get in step see we hold the key and so many times today there's people wasting time wasting money on foolishness not getting ready to go building bigger and you know now you all need a bigger church obviously but we're talking about foolishness out there you know so it's because we still have three kinds of believers only in heaven there'll be no mate believers no unbelievers you won't have to watch what you say it'll all be peace jesus told us in matthew 24 that would come those along that claim to be anointed and appear to be very special because they say things like follow me single file i know the but jesus told us in advance do not believe such people then a few years later paul came along and gave us the words over in second second thessalonians yeah second thessalonians chapter 2 because he had to deal with a lot of stuff okay let's see here second thessalonians chapter 2 verse 1 now we beseech your brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by the gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or troubled neither by spirit or uh nor by word nor by letter as from us which means that there was people out there with fake letters you know as the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you remember jesus over there in matthew 24 no man deceive you let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come shall not come except there come a falling away first so we are looking to that day but before we get there there's going to be a falling away from the truth so here in this day i say this day this scripture is being fulfilled you see there are forces operating through people slowly removing the deity out of the name of jesus christ and they're also people actively engaged in bringing fulfillment to these verses of second thessalonians it's happening brother brendan said in 1955 as moses went with that judgment stick before him so here's this stick he found on the desert okay got this stick as moses went with that judgment stick before him that same stick tonight that the church is jesus christ if those egyptians could ever got that little simple stick out of moses hands they would have had him whipped and when the devil can never get the deity out of the name of jesus christ he will have the church whipped these aren't words to fill up the tape this is a prophet speaking these things are happening today there's people with this same bible oh jesus wasn't god well i think we'll just have to go to the bible and find out prophet says he was so we don't have to listen to you you know so quickly get away from such dangerous borderline of unbelief you see eve did not plan on going into such depths of unbelief she listens she reasoned oh well you've been here longer maybe you know what you're talking about well look where we're at perversion everything you see so none of the individuals who have turned their back on the truth that we treasure not one of them plan to go that far they really believe that they're right but one day they'll have to close the bible also because they can't go any farther so it's already predicted that it's not going to be smooth sailing troubled waters ahead and so we always thought yeah it'll be way out there no deer now now is the time but i thought everybody carrying these books and quoting our prophet will be worthy of our confidence well i wish but you better discern the spirits it's another good tape discernment of spirit 1960 covers it all in the day it's jesus they had the pharisees they knew their prophet's message to the letter they knew when you left out of the or whatever and um they were leaning very heavily on their understanding you see and we have the exact same situation today people today very important people calling for single a single file believers when brother brown says let's arm up this way across make a sweep but we're calling for single single line uh believers which means take a number go back the line don't ever raise your hand shut up follow that's not god's program you see how can this be happening very simple god's map is all on one page i know that didn't sound reasonable to some of your young people but it used to be we had a map book yeah sold it over walmart for 12.95 and you want to go from texas to arizona well let's see how we're going to get there the map books in alphabetical order the states so if you're going to go west well then you got to find let's see texas well then well there's new mexico well that's arizona's clear at the front of the book god's map is all on one page okay paul wrote without controversy great is a mystery of godliness in the spanish bible it says indiscribente that means unarguably great it's a mystery of godliness so we have super intelligent people today and um they're always ready to argue and make it a matter of controversy i know them yeah friends of mine the time is now for the fulfillment of these scriptures now is the time for the manifestation of every seed according to its kind the scriptures cannot be broken they cannot be stopped it's in movement our god is on time and he's all about balance everywhere our canary brain cannot interpret the mind of god if you don't like the canaries about a chicken brain pretty small you know but god speaks to his anointed prophet god fulfills his word it's always on schedule the time is now when this prophetic word is in effect it's always been the case from the beginning from the church age from the first church until today brother branham says over here in the church age book in every age we have the exact same pattern so it's going to repeat that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken they add here they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure revival it dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice be careful for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god paul warned them to say what he said even as peter did likewise so we've always had voice of god on the planet someplace he warned them that even he paul could not change one word of what he had been given by revelation how important it is to hear the voice of god by way of his messengers and then say what has been given to say to the churches so we as ministers we're not innovators we're not out here inventing and and changing things we're just trying to repeat what he said just stick with the program you know to build this church out here there's a very expensive set of blueprints and whoever comes to work well i think there ought to be an outlet here and i we don't care what you think you got to stick with the blueprint so that's the way it is here we've got to stick with what the blueprint you see and we're not money gatherers we're not the managers of god's bride no we're not seeking to control everything a minister anointed with the spirit of god genuinely trusts god for everything and he's not a micromanager so we are simply repeaters sent out to encourage the bride of christ but sometimes we've got to bring some bad news like today because these things are happening okay our job is to make christ real to the people for the perfecting of the saints we are public servants just like the garbage man he's a public servant the policeman whatever and um we uh we don't deviate from the blueprint we got to stick with it not to improvise okay 1950 prophet says lift up your heads redemption is drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing critics infidels waxing worse and worse back then what would he say today we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to god so the time is now friends what are you focusing on are you focusing on getting ready and getting out of here what are you what are you reflecting in dark laodicea he says here you remember church that you're living in the best day that you will ever live in right now until jesus comes it shall gradually then it changes not gradually rapidly get worse and worse so when we see these things we see it happening around us what are we going to do we're going to run away and go off to montana or canada or no or we're going to call 9-1-1 we can change churches now that happens well too much pressure here i'll think oh just saying we can call headquarters hey what's up what should i do now lift up your head redemption is drawing 9. luke 21 28 all this is predicted to be everything that happened to jesus was predicted there was no surprises with god it was all mapped out so when these things happen just look up you can't change this you can't help it he says here and they have to call us bad names oh why why can't we just have get along they have to call us bad names they have to call the truth bad names jesus said whosoever speaks a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven when he's doing the very same thing you see done but whosoever shall speak against the holy ghost when it comes to do the same thing will never be forgiven in this world they have to do that there has to be a message like that to make people make fun of it to show god's justice to condemn the whole world and destroy it while there's mercy and someone standing in the gap jesus christ and an open door tonight won't you receive him my friend won't you get yourself straightened up and start at the foot of the cross 1961 abraham and his seat after him do you know what god did he reached out with his hand and stopped it he is holding time in his hand for the church to make itself ready there's a few members yet to come into the body of christ maybe one of them is here today that's why i'm here that's why i'm led to be here is to portray you i'm not saying don't be a catholic don't be methodist not saying that but i want you to be filled with this spirit just remember i'll meet you on that day and these words will be a witness against you it's all on god's tape recording with this great picture camera and you sitting there walking away and leaving it you'll see yourself that day in the mirror of god he says the gospel and the power of almighty god has spread around the world and the separation time is now taking place god is calling a bride the devil is calling a church let me be part of that bride you have a choice it's not over yet you still have a choice so the time is now don't let another hour go by without getting totally serious be sure this is not just something you learn and you're repeated and um like i was telling you before they read a portion of their prophet's message every saturday in the synagogues and we come around a similar situation it's got to be alive you see so we must know the reality of believing god so you must be born again partake in the kingdom of god and the word has come to a place where god has brought you to a place where you need to be to be restored you see that's the ministry of elijah to restore places in correct position for the resurrection and the rapturing of a special people now a couple more things in the third seal now notice that god told eve that after a long after so long a time the word is coming back to you now how does she fall i want my class to say it what did she fall from the word the word and god said he would make a way to redeem her back to the word again after so long a time the word would be made known to her all right the word would come back for one purpose now hold that what i'm saying the word would come back to her for one purpose for redemption he says jesus overcame by the word eve fell to the personal temptation of satan by falling by failing to use the word adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer it is the only way that you can know if you're overcoming because the word cannot fail so to stay balanced we've got four steps you read your bible okay if you just read a chapter a day read your bible listen to 20 minutes of god's anointed prophet there's other preachers on the radio yeah but listen to the prophet read a page in your church age book it won't hurt you and you pray even when you're stuck in traffic you pray you create your own personal atmosphere with these steps you will prosper as an individual and you'll prosper as a body of believers as the musicians come james 4 says resist the devil and he will flee from you the next verse draw near to god and he will draw near to you but you have a part to play it's not so automatic see god is not unreasonable unreachable he loves you he cares for you so in closing pay attention you don't read if you don't take anything else away from here how can a believer avoid the traps and side roads that satan has so smoothly prepared the solution is right here in your bible you know paul traveled about ten thousand miles in 30 years he didn't have an suv he walked and had a horse and he spent some time in an area known as galatia had some converts they believed they were baptized but in a very a few months later he comes by the twin had showed up just like in the time of william branham i knew that some of the twins and so paul comes back to check on him a few months later and to check on the believers no cell phones how you all do it no he had to go there and he came back what do you think he found the twin had come by and caught the attention of some of them and so he's speaking to them and over here in chapter one of galatians he says i marvel i'm surprised that you're so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you cause confusion and and and would pervert the gospel of christ but if i come back next week if silas comes if if william branham comes if david mcgarry or george smith or if an angel boom and bring something different than what i already gave you by revelation don't accept it because he's going to the hot place so the only thing that's real is what is squared with paul's gospel may god have mercy let's stand together sweep over my soul sweep over my soul i believe it's on your computer there's some place sweep over my souls [Music] is [Music] once again [Music] is [Music] you know that song here in this city where the lamb is the light try to end this on a happy note let everything go away happening but you've heard truth now what you do with it's another story there's a country on there [Music] [Applause] is [Music] that's [Music] [Applause] hey [Music] [Applause] [Music] this little lady here has made a life-changing decision now you all know where his last week she was jennifer but she did something this week and she's got the same initials but now it's jenna shelley shelby we love you so i want you to get your man go stand at the back door and everybody's going to come by how much they love you once again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now if you just happen to have a few little dollar bills you want to stick and ben and janna's hand that would just be all right with me okay just you know they're fixing to go on their honeymoon very rarely do we get a married couple to be able to be with us in service so i just think it's awesome i think it kind of shows where the hearts at don't you amen what's number one so i think that's great so don't be afraid just to if you've only got a nickel give them a nickel maybe they can buy uh what can you buy anything for a nickel i don't know give them but they'll maybe they'll add up so just just show your love to them and we really appreciate it we appreciate having all our visitors here but i think when we sum up this morning i think we realize that the weight of it falls on each of us as individuals it's not going to be a group thing i like being in groups you can hide in a group but when we stand in that light it's just going to be what our thoughts were what our actions were where our affections were and what we had first in our lives uh and you know and this whole society we're in is so instant and you know that we just hardly wait on the lord anymore just get alone in his presence and let him speak to you and talk to you and look at your life in the mirror and and see how that you can go farther examine yourself and and line yourself up with the word amen we live by the word of god so let this morning as we covered so many scriptures but let it set with us in our hearts that i've got a responsibility i got a responsibility to myself to make my life right because i have to remove the beam from my own eye before i can even approach the sliver in someone else's i've got to make sure my light is shining bright and my lamp is trimmed and clear i've got to set myself down for personal examination and there's so many things out there to distract us from that we can overwork we can overdo a lot of things but we can't over pray and so i hope this morning that each of us makes a commitment to the scriptures and to our own personal life hidden christ and i think if we do that [Music] i think we'll see a candle set on a hilltop and that one that's lost that we're waiting for he may see a light just like moses saw a burning bush and he was attracted to that light may your life be so set aside in the lord that someone's attracted to you to what hope it is and this morning if you're not as close to him as you ought to be he hasn't went anywhere he's right where you left him he never took a step away from you but if you draw an eye unto him he'll draw an eye unto you so as we go and you greet our lovely newly wedded couple remember that you're wed too then you have a husband to serve and his name's the lord jesus christ so let's little have such a a great dedication as we go this morning we'll sing this song is our dismissal song this morning let us bow our heads one more time in prayer our heavenly father we've assembled here from many places many of our fellow believers from our neighboring state of alabama have come father to spend this time with us before they return home to their battlefield where you have placed them to spread the light and the good hope and the hope of the delivering power of the cross at calvary we ask that you bless them father may they prosper and be in good health father may they multiply father may they have fruits of their labor and father may you bring them and guide them ever closer to the true word of god that they might grow in wisdom and knowledge father for all our visitors from wherever they come may this same hope go with each of us for those that are here local father may we ever become more dedicated to the truth of your word the solemn holiness and sacredness of the gospel may we get not caught up in the flighty laughter of lady osea may we rededicate our hearts and rededicate our lives may we realize the importance of the closing hours of time and may we keep in sight the great reward that waits for those that serve him be with us now as we go in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen god bless you go in peace [Music] i am [Music] from [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] i am [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] me [Music] there's nothing like this [Music] is [Music] i am is [Music] forever [Music] there's nothing like the presence of the lord [Music] is the lord when i am [Music] when i am [Music] forever [Music] so [Music] you
