um request before the church um sister Atlanta has an unspoken prayer request for tomorrow we know that God knows the heart he knows the need and we can as a body take an unspoken prayer request before the Lord and intercede and ask God to move on behalf of this request also uh we have a prayer request for Felix long who is suffering from paralysis um um sister Joy is asking prayer for her sister Jenna she's going into labor and we're just uh believing together for just a successful delivery in the health of the baby and the mother just pray that God would just move on the scene and just take away any nervousness any anxiety any fear just cast that right out of the room and may they just experience the joy and the gift that God is giving them to bring a life and what I believe is another son or daughter of God into this world maybe that'll be the last one and we'll just be caught right out of here huh it's going to happen one of these days I'm looking forward to it amen also um we we just want to um brother Jeff Howard was just leaving after service and a lot of us had a detour um leaving the church and little did we know that was brother Jeff that had been in an accident both involved in the accident the um as far as there's nothing serious but yet uh there are some they're banged up a little bit um and uh it it's put brother Jeff in a little bit of a bind because he was starting a a job tomorrow and now he's in a predicament of of transportation and um he's a uh just kind of in wonderment of of how um the timing of this but I know one thing we have a promise all things work together for good so then I believe as a body of believer belies we can believe together and say you know brother Jeff Good's coming not because that's our word but because he promised it you believe that amen I I think we need to shake ourselves tonight it seems like everybody's kind of uh uh a little tired and and uh w we we we should be in great expectation for things we got prayer requests but we got a god who's more than able to move on the scene for our brother Jeff and these these needs that have uh have been mentioned across the pole but let's just believe together we'll just ask brother Andrew to come and open our service in prayer why don't we all Stand Together intercede on behalf of these requests and we'll take these needs before the Lord amen God bless you let

prepare for the word shall we just bow our hearts in a word of prayer Our he Heavenly Father we are so thankful tonight that once again Lord we could be gathered in your presence and Lord we couldn't think of a better place to be tonight than to be in the presence of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords she Prophet taught us oh God you do not desire roll out carpets and fan fa Lord you desire Lord God Humble Hearts we pray father tonight may you come and break the bread of life you Prophet said oh God that any man with physical strength can turn the pages of the Bible but it takes him oh God that was worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof to bring out the context of your word may you bless your word to our hearts tonight as we ask it in Jesus name amen amen while we are standing let us turn to our Bibles for a scripture reading we'll turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 32 from verses 24 to 30 Genesis 32 from: 24 to 30 and Jacob was left alone and they Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be no more called Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he says wherefore is it that thou does ask after my name and he blessed him there and Jacob called the name of the place Pinel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so tonight uh brother Matthew was in the spirit tonight he actually sang the title of what I was going to speak on tonight I would like to speak on the face of God amen amen and um also uh uh we find here in Genesis chapter 32 it was like it was a preview in the C chapter of what was going to happen at the end time he was there at the face of God and we've seen on Sunset Mountain the face of God so I don't know if our brother can just project the face of God up there we can have a look and I believe that each and every one of us oh there it is each and every one of us have this picture in our home but what significance does this face of God have to us what meaning is there to the face of God and brother brandham actually expl uh describes what this picture was that this was absolutely the face of Jesus Christ and just to start off I'd like to see read a quotation from the message the rising of the sun he says remember I was preaching when this Vision Came Upon the subject of the Book of Revelations where the old judges where we see Jesus in Revelations 1 when we started to open the Seven Seals or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of The Seven Seals Christ was standing with head a like wool what and I describe that to you that the old English judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority amen so we have the Supreme judge of Heaven and Earth that has made his appearance here at the end time well the prophet says if you'll turn the picture like this and look you can probably see it from the audience it's Christ see his eyes year just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and the judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes his nose his mouth just turn the picture from this the way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be so the first time that they saw the face of Christ when the prophet turned the picture and he says that the picture of Christ God had his picture taken here at the end time amen can you see it he Supreme judge because there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again of indication that this message is the truth amen it is true and making him not a third person but the only person see you see the dark his face his beard his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light so we see there's the face but from him I think I've got my little pointer here he says from him seems like it's not working oh it's the wrong way around anyway we see the face and then we see from the face comes the light so the picture is complete when it has the light in it amen so we see brother Bram now listen what the prophet says after this he's looking from him comes this light a shining on the right side to which he is looking to so that is a shining face The Shining face of God and on the cross that's where he looked looked to the right where he pardoned The Sinner on the light in the light of his resurrection we will still go forth in his name amen now the prophet says that Jacob he wrestled all night he wrestled until the change came so it was a changing dispensation it was changing of Jacob from a deceiver to were Prince with power before God and we find that it happened at the breaking of a new day yeah amen he said he said the angel said let me go the day is breaking he said I will not let you go until you bless me am see so we find Jacob's name was changed from an Earthly name and he was a deceiver Jacob means deceiver to a name given by God a name recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life and I think it's so fitting to the end time scripture of Revelation chapter 13 that the Beast that was to come upon the Earth shall deceive all those whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life so all those whose names are not written will be deceived by the Beast system and we thank God Amen that we've seen our name Hallelujah so we find here in uh brother Bram says that Jacob cried in the message called desperation Jacob cried like never before desperately he called until he got a hold of God so this was not just an experience of having a sensation but this was a so changing experience he could never be a deceiver again it was the day when he experienced the rebirth the new birth in his soul he walked differently he spoke differently he came there as one person as the deceiver but when he left that experience he walked differently God Chang his walk God changed his talk he was now a manifestation of what God had in his mind God's word expressed for the hour and he wrestled with the angel he said yeah he wrestled to keep him in his soul see it was a soul experience and this is what the message of the hour does it's not a sensation but it's a soul changing experience you can never be the same again you can never go back to the world again because something has happened on the inside and this is the experience that Jacob had in the face of God and we've all had this experience when the face of God has appeared again here at the end time the same experience that Jacob had he said he was able to hold on until the blessing come he wrestled desperately until the blessing come then when he when he seen until God came on the scene and then in despair I'll not let you go when you begin to feel the blessing come down on him so he was not just uh happy with you know feeling maybe just the presence of God but he wanted a change a soul changing experience and this is what the message does to us change us from the inside out we're no longer what we used to be God has changed us we have been transformed into living images of the Living God see a lot of people say glory to God I got it now theyve they you're they you're deceived see somebody say oh I just feel so good brother brandham I went down there and prayed oh Shivers ran all over me and that might have been God I saw a great light before me that still might have been God but that ain't what I'm talking about there's got to be an inside change the Bible said in Hebrews the 6th chapter the rain falleth on the the just and the unjust just the same now you might take wheat and take weeds and put them in the field and the rain is actually sent for the wheat but the rain falls on the weeds the same as it does the wheat they'll make them rejoice and clap hands and do all kinds of things all the Motions but there's not a change and that's what we are looking for as we heard this morning that word is not going to become flesh in our flesh amen he says here and the rain and the weeds are just as happy about the rain as the wheat is and it's the very same rign the very Holy Ghost can fall upon an unbeliever and make him act just exactly the same way a Believer acts but by their fruits they are known that's what I'm talking about the token and Jacob rather in desp desperation he said I know I feel you you you are here with me but I'm not going to let you go until I feel the change and that's what we got to feel the change see somebody sees it fine the first little sensation they get up and jump up and down run up and down the aisle say I got it I got it I got it oh no see Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different made him different person because that he stayed until that happened and the Bible said he held until he prevailed brother brandham says how can a man Prevail over God but you can do it you there in travail you're wrestling with God until you feel the change you can Prevail over God you leave with a blessing see you can do it a man can Prevail over God so this place where Jacob had this experience was called Pinel and in Hebrew it means the face of God and the name Jacob means a deceiver as brother brandham says he had run all of his life but when he got in the presence of God when he got in the face of God Jacob got a revelation of something that was real that's why we had an experience in this message that we have never known before we might have been in a church we might have been good churchgoers we might have been good worshippers and all those things but the change came when we were brought in the presence of the face of God see Jacob got a revelation of something and this Revelation that Jacob received allowed him to get a hold of God and once Jacob got a hold of God he held on he wouldn't let him go and from what Jacob was a deceiver he was now a manifested Son of God and you find the Propet said that Jacob held onto the face of God Jacob had a face tace experience with God that's why your face portrays certain qualities just by your face you know God could have shown his foot because the scripture says he put one foot upon the land and one upon the sea God could have shown a book that was open because remember the lamb he comes with an open book but why would he show his face there must be a reason why see and when one looks at the face it portrays certain uh qualities you know your face is your identification as we heard this morning it shows us who you are when you go to the bank you take your identification with you your ID card and they look at the card they look at your face the same person it's your identification see and we find that this is what they use to identify you that is why when the thief goes and rob the bank he covers his face so as long as he covers his face you will remain a mystery see this the secret lies in the face see and you find that your face reflects what goes on on the inside of you amen your face reveals your nature whether you are sick whether you are a mean person whether you are a kind person whether you are an arrogant person is all reflected on your face see your face also exposes who you are it gives away the the secrets of your hidden feelings whether you are happy whether you are joyful it shows what is hidden in your heart is reflected on your face your face also represents your personal presence your personal attention I could be standing here and I could be having a chat with brother Matthew you haven't got my personal presence my attention but once I show you my face then you have my personal attention amen and we find that that your face is also the most vulnerable part of your body that's how when two boxes are fighting you know you'll punch the body you'll try and we out his opponent but the actual last punch he gives you is in the face so the knockout punch comes in the face so we find that God revealed his most vulnerable part when the revealed us his face see he came now to reveal the hidden secrets that was hidden from the foundation of the world he's now come to reveal the Lamb's wife the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife is now making herself ready he also came to reveal the mystery of the Rapture The Mystery of the seals the mystery of all these things amen when his face appeared on sunset Mountain and the face is also the most looked after part of a person if you want to hurt somebody say something about his face you know just say anything bad about his face but his nose or whatever amen it's the most look after part it's also the part which gets the most attention is the face you know put all the creams on there it must look nice and all these things see you must present yourself and here God Reveals His face to us so all the secrets there's nothing withheld anymore there's no veils or whatever so in other words when the ministers finish speaking he mustn't leave you with a lot of mysteries because all the veils has been unveiled all the secrets has been revealed we now look at him face to face amen so we find that the woman that laughed at the cloud picture which is the face of God the prophet said that was not nothing but blasphemy you know that picture of the cloud it's actually a supernatural picture it's a picture that cannot be tampered with you cannot put any other face into that face but that is the face of God himself you say well halfman's head of Christ it looks exactly the same but he doesn't look the same halfman's head of Christ is only an IM imaginary picture even though the prophet says you know it looks like him but brother says there are no artists that can paint the qualities of that face there's only one face like that amen the face of Jesus Christ amen so we find a mystery was revealed in the face of God and the prophet went West to meet one of his angels they the week form the face of God and he got the revelation of the seven seed says go back to Jeffersonville those Mysteries has been he will be revealed where did he get it in the face of God Amen that's why when we have that picture in our home it speaks of so many things you know as we will get to it right away and yet Jacob held onto the face of God in the personal presence of God until the breaking of a new day amen the Shalom rise Shine for thy light has come amen the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee the breaking of the new day was when the face was revealed unto us Allelujah and God said let me go the sun is rising but Jacob stayed in the face of God until it was Sun up until the breaking of a new day that's why we are out of denominational ages now we are now in the bright age we're now in the age of the Rapture at any moment the church could be gone we hear so many things of War even nuclear war we do anything out of Step you can press the the button and the atomic bombs will go could happen at any time so brother and sister we are living in an hour of rapture could have it even happen even before the sun rises tomorrow morning we are living in the hour that the generation that will see the rapturing of the church see so when Jacob left the face of God he was a changed man he probably walked as a you know real deceiver but when he left that place he started limping he walked differently why he had an experience with God and any man that has an experience with God your walk and your talk and everything there's a change about you why because you've been in the presence of God Amen so we find that Jacob went away with revelation await away knowing he was justified he could never be the same again something happened on the inside he went away knowing he could never deceive again that face-to-face experience with God brought Jacob Revelation and salvation amen he has seen the signs of God brother Braham says he had had the dream Dre of God but none of these could change Jacob amen we've been to the seven Church ages they've had all the signs and the Wonders and the wonderful experiences with God Pentecost I probably was the greatest but none of those things could bring the change but the day he had an experience on the face of God it was the day that ushered in the change that's why we know the change has come because God has shown his face see we find that there that was the time now we could walk as a manifested Son of God Jacob had obtained a victory in his soul and Jacob says in Genesis 32:3 I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved you know what the word preserved means it means to maintain in its original condition and that's how we know who we are we were always Sons and Daughters of God Amen and this experience has brought to us our true identity of who we really are amen you in the mind of God Amen waiting for the hour of manifestation so it was a thought and the thought became a word and the Word was spoken by the prophet and here we sit tonight the manifested thoughts the word of God made flesh today Hallelujah so we find that what God originally intended Jacob to be God didn't intend him to be a deceiver neither did did he intend you to be the person that you were before your salvation because the germ of life was on the inside the real you was on the inside waiting for the quickening waiting to come into the presence of the Living God which gerti the seed then the real you came into manifestation you can testify you can sing to the glory of God you can Minister the word of God the real you has now come to manifestation Hallelujah you testify of the goodness of God Amen Hallelujah as the song goes you know I will sing of the goodness of God Amen you can look back you can see where the Lord has brought you through to what you are today it's the grace of almighty God Amen so what happened on that day he wrestled at the face of God Pinel he wrestle with God until the change come a lifechanging revelation that's why you know it's not a matter of joining the message or just following the message but this is a lifechanging experience you realize that you are now a son and a daughter of God that within you there's a a supernatural element which indwells your mortal body you're no longer yourself anymore you're now a son and a daughter of God hallelujah so we find that amen I just want to go a bit F faster because I realize we have something else afterwards so now the change came also when Moses was in the presence of God now let's read the word of e the book of Exodus 34: 32-35 and afterwards all the children of Israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all the Lord Lord had spoken with him in Mount Si until Moses had done speaking with them he put a veil on his face but when Moses went in the Lord to speak with him he took the veil off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of Israel that which was commanded and the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that the skin of his face sh sh and Moses put a veil upon his face again until he went in to speak with them brother BR says Moses went into the pillar of fire where he got the word of the Lord and when Moses came out that wasn't Moses anymore that was God and when he put the veil of his face it was Moos was was actually Moses putting a veil over God's face for that generation he covered his face in other words the mystery for that day was made known to Moses and he had to Veil while it was still in he was God but once he spoke the word he was Moses again and what happened he took the veil of his face amen this all got to do with the face Hallelujah so we find that uh brother brandham says that every motion that Moses did before the burning bush it was a type of Christ he said the rod that turned into a ser serent it typed sin already judged the Brazen serpent that was lifted up in the wilderness typed Christ being lifted up upon the cross of Calvary and the right hand had turned into white leprosy in its Advanced stage the moment Moses put that right hand into his bosom pulled it out it was instantly healed and when Jesus died on Calvary amen when he said it is finished that moment the sin question was dealt with you could now come and get the Forgiveness of your sin and here we find Moses face we saw the staff we saw his hand but now the face he typed the face of God it meant the living presence of God was with him amen so we find that on Sunset Mountain The Shining face of God appeared what was it we never received a visitation from Kentucky we had a visitation from Heaven God came and appeared in our midst Hallelujah we find that Moses shining shining face type the face of God now what does The Shining face of God means in Scripture that shining face of God means the living presence of God and with a living presence of God it brings the blessings of God and with the blessings of God comes Revelation it comes Redemption comes salvation on Sunset Mountain was The Shining face of God he was now coming with the secrets of redemption it was the living presence of God coming to us here at the end time amen now I just like to read some scriptures pertaining to The Shining face of God you see it's all in the scripture what God has done in this day takes us back to the Bible in Numbers Chapter 6 and verse 24 whenever a blessing was pronounced over the children of Israel listen how it was done the Lord bless thee and keep Thee the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee so brother and sisters the face of God has Shone upon us we are a blessed people upon the Earth God has looked down upon us listen what he said the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace his face his countenance has been lifted up upon us the prophet says that was our Lord up there amen you think brother and sister that we had a visitation from God God has come to to to to to reveal his word at the end time now brother brandham says God doesn't leave his word to be interpreted by man his word is of no private interpretation God makes a promise and he comes and manifest the promise who could manifest Luke 17:30 Revelations 10 the Lord himself had to come to make these words real to us amen says the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace and they shall shall put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them we are a blessed people tonight see we find in in Psalms 31 we find that his face shines and brings salvation he says here in Psalms 31:1 15 my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from them that persecute me make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy Mercy's sake with The Shining face of God comes salvation so salvation has come to us through the message of the hour and Psalms 80:3 turn us again oh God and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved see a desire that the face of God must shine and what a blessing we have what a privilege that we have that the face of God has shown Upon Us brought salvation to us in the hour of Darkness Psalms 8:4 and the Lord of God of hosts how long will thou be angry against the prayer of thy people thou Feed Us them with the bread of tears and giveth them tears to drink in great measure thou makest us a Strife unto our neighbors and our enemies love amongst themselves 18 ver7 turn us again oh god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved they always desired to have the face of God to shine upon them you think brother we would ask for it but he came anyhow with his great Plan of Salvation for the bridey at the end time and here Psalms 8:17 let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou mest strong for thyself so will not we go back from thee Quicken us and we will call upon thy name turn us again O Lord of hosts cause thy face to shine upon us and we shall be saved so when you see that picture of the cloud picture in your home it's your salvation in This Day Psalms 119 verse 1-5 you find it also brings Heavenly divine revelation the face of God make thy face to shine upon us and teach me thy statutes how does God teach by Revelation he reveals himself to you in Psalm 67 verses 1-2 we find both salvation and Revelation to the chief musician in negano a Psalm or a song God be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us that thy way may be known or revealed upon the Earth thy saving Health among the Nations amen there's no question that this message is the truth the face of God has shined Upon Us in Ecclesiastes 8 verse one we find that Revelation makes a man's face to shine see Revelation a wise man is a man that knows the secret he knows the answer Ecclesiastes 81 who is as a wise man who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to shine that's why he came with a shining face because he had the Revelation the Seven Seals had to come forth yes he brought the mysteries of God all the secret of redemption that's what the scripture says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished why because the face of God has shun H Allelujah and in finally in the time of Daniel when Israel's time was up the prophet prayed for Mercy he says in Daniel 9:17 now therefore Oh Our God hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolation and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousness but for thy great mercies had a prayer Lord make your face to shine you think how blessed we are that we have The Shining face of God shining upon us we find another place in Matthew chapter 17:2 when he was revealing the order of his coming to bring Salvation both to Jew and Gentile in verse 17 verse1 and of the sixth day Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his reignment was white as light and behold the appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him amen as you all know that Elias was the ministry of Elijah that was to come to the Gentiles to our hearts to the faith of the fathers Jew Moses represented the law afterward he comes to the Jew he also represented the resurrected Saints and the dead Saints Hallelujah and how did it come by Shining face upon the mountain Hallelujah God does every time he does the same thing he's the same yesterday today and forever and here we find in Revelations 10 verse 1 at the breaking of the seven seal and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun it's a shining face see and his feet as pillars of fire see that was the coming of the Lord for the opening brother Braham says Revelation 10 is the opening of The Seven seal that is the spirit coming of Christ the descending of the logos of God the Lord himself descending first Thessalonians says and the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the archangel and the Trump of God and brother Bram says he does all these three in his descending and the shout is the living bread of life bringing forth a bride you are here because of the shout message the living bread of life Christ amen the Lord himself in our midst manifesting the L their promises Hallelujah there's never been a day like this day there never been a light that shines so bright as this glorious light the light of his glorious coming see and here we find as Moses came from the burning bush he hid the glory of God now the glory of God is the word in human flesh amen and we find he at was the word was in the prophet for that age and the face of Moses shine because of the word that was in him and as Moses had to put a veil over his face because they could not set for was he look at The Shining face of Moses which represented the face of God but when Moses dropped the Veil The Mysteries were revealed that was revealed in the pillar of fire amen that's why Moses was a type of Christ through seven Church ages Christ was revealed was veiled amen until the the word came at the end time and when you appeared on Sunset Mountain he had no Veil why all the Mysteries has been revealed the horse riders and all these things has been made known amen so we find brother and sister that uh brother Braham says here Moses had the word now remember after the word was made manifest Moses was Moses again but while that word was in him to be give out he was God for he wasn't Moses no more he had the word of the Lord for that age nothing could touch him till that was over he had the word in him so therefore when he come the people turned their heads they couldn't understand he'd been changed he was a different fellow he came with the word and he put the veil the Bible said over his face God covered his face in his Prophet see he had veiled so God veiled himself in Moses and gave Moses the word and Moses came down and spoke the word of the Lord see in a veil over his face that's right Jehovah veiled in the form of a prophet and that's how he appeared at the end time Jehovah veiled in the form of a prophet the prophet had been in the Pillar of Fire amen and he was now the veil speaking what was later to be placed behind other veils amen he was speaking a bride there was no bride but he spoke the bride into manifestation let there be a bride there will be a bride there will be a Rapture amen why cuz God said it amen the word has gone forth so no matter what happens it must manifest he says he said let there be light could thousands of years but because the word was spoken that light had to come forth amen he said there will be a bride no matter what happens the bride will be there there will be a Rapture Hallelujah see he had veiled God veiled him in Moses and Moses came down and spoke the word of the Lord in a veil over his face that's right Jehovah veiled in the form of a prophet and God said he wouldn't speak to them like that anymore he would only speak to them by a prophet that's the only way he ever speak from then on in other words it was God speaking again when the prophet comes it's God speaking to us see that's the only way that's the only way he ever spoke that's right never any other way see so it was today it was Jehovah veiled in a prophet William Bram was wasn't God although you can say it but you going to say it to the right Revelation amen he was the veil that God hid behind a son of man revealing the son of man he was the lust veiled be the veil of a man amen remember brother brandham says it was first uh uh Elohim the self-existent one he couldn't be seen But while he was in that form we were the attributes that were in him and from Elohim he became logos the visible form of God and from the logos he came human flesh amen and he was in the process of now restoration to bring back what was lost in Eden and while he was in that virgin born he had to die a death upon the cross of Calvary so that that same logos that was now in him could come on the day of Pentecost and break itself up in the first church that started on the day of Pentecost amen it fell at NAIA Rome but after 2,000 years that puf fire is back again amen he said he'll turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers back to that same experience he says Pentecost is not a denomination Pentecost is an experience the pillar of fire dividing itself again we are attributes of this great logos that has come here at the end time amen see so we find here that when Christ appeared on Sunset Mountain there was no Veil why no more Mysteries all the Mysteries are revealed amen somebody cannot come and say well could it be this or could it be that no we speak why because the whole word has been open before us amen there's no Veil anymore amen we are now inside the veil of the of the presence of God living of the Hidden manner hidden from the foundation of the world the secret things of God he says here in 2 Corinthians the scripture says that the veil is taken from the face of Christ in 2 Corinthians 3:12 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished which is the law amen but their minds were blinded that's Israel for until this day the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ remember when he died the veil of the temple was ripped from top to the bottom and brother Bram says God unveiled the true Mercy Seat amen it was Christ hanging upon the cross of Calvary amen the true Mercy he came into view see but their minds were blinded the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses is read the Veil is upon their heart you know they say so much about Israel but they are a nation with a promise they are a nation amongst all the nations of the world that God has chosen to be his people and they've always been a rejected Nation amen but there are a people with a promise Messiah is going to be revealed to them Moses and Elijah is going to still minister to them amen but it cannot happen while the bride is still on the Earth and we living right at that transition time it could happen at any time you know you three repeats yourself remember when Jesus was upon the Earth he says when you see the armies gathered around Jerusalem he says head for the heels amen head for the heels you are in trouble and now we see the armies again gathering around Jerusalem and brother brandham says that Israel is God time pleas so if Israel is God's time pleas and the armies are gathering around Jerusalem how late are we it is later than we think brother brah says don't run to your denomination but run to Christ amen there's a place where you got to find a hiding place H Allelujah he says here nevertheless but even to this day when Moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away when their heart is stand to the Lord the veil will be taken away they'll ask where do you get those cars they say in the house of my friends they realize the very one that they were waiting for he came and they were the one that crucified him amen but he said don't be angry with yourself God did this to preserve life if you hadn't blind them there would have been no Gentile bride but their blindness was the ushering in of the Gentile bride over seven Church ages but now our days are coming to a close amen the church ages it's over it's only the bride that has come because now the ministry is to the bride is to the elect the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride who is this mlisc amen all these great promises is happening right here it's a Ministry not to denomination but now this is to the bride the seed of Abram receive your last sign last sign to the Royal seed of Abram what God did to Abram before the pr promise son came he does the same to the elect to the Royal seed of Abram before the promise un comes he's going to turn with his back to the congregation and he's going to start Discerning the heart of the royal seed amen it was that time when the promised son was on his way Hallelujah see so we find his hi his face has been hid his face was veiled Through the Ages but there had to come a time when the veil is lifted from the face of Christ the seals had to be broken because while the seals were still sealing The Plan of Redemption it was a veiled book but now the veils has been taken off the seals were broken now we can see what it's all about the whole plan of redemp Redemption has come into Plain View but brand says notice veiled in a human flesh Moses with that word speaking what was to be later put behind Badger skins so is Christ Our Moses Christ Our Moses he was God veiled in human flesh veiled in humanity in flesh that's right now this what the brother Bram says and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen whenever he says that it means he's doing it right now he's the same what he's done in the past he's doing it right now and this time he was veiled in a man now notice the same yesterday today and forever promised word to this age he still Christ The Promised word for this age veiled in human flesh the word is God but you find that Paul in the Bible prophesied that the glory will be revealed in the face of Jesus Christ let's turn to the scripture in 2 Corinthians 4: 3-6 but if our gospel be hid it is heed to them that are lost in whom the God of this world world that blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them amen this gospel is a Shining Light it has come to shine rise Shine for thy light has come the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee his glory shall be seen upon thee light has come to Quicken those GTI seed that was in God before the foundation of the world in whom the God of this world it says in verse four chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servant for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness had shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God where in the face of Jesus Christ amen so there's so many things happening when the face appears I think we should be so excited so thankful to the Lord that his face has Shone upon us he says the light of the glory of God will be revealed in the face of Jesus Christ so when the veil is broken We Shall Behold that glory and by revelation behold that face and be changed into that same Glory from Glory unto Glory he's changing us from Mortal to immortality the Rapture is already in process we are just waiting for the body change amen hallelujah yeah in 2 Corinthians 3:16 it says nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away now the the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with an open face beholding as in a dark as a in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into that same image yeah from Glory unto Glory but BR said she is him she he was the word manifested she now becomes the word manifested she's bone of his bone she's Spirit of his Spirit she's life of his life she is him it's like Eve was taken out of Adam she is taken out of the second Adam amen she's part of his body she's a part of his bones Hallelujah Jesus in the form of a brine Allelujah so we find that his face speaks of his immediate presence and every attribute Son of God will enjoy his immediate presence when the veil is taken off the face of God I mean what a wonderful time we had this morning we could feel the presence of the Lord because of the word the anointing is upon the word he could move right across here good sense that the Lord was with us this morning at Sweet presence and me but s can be healed The Sinner can be saved you can receive your baptism of the Holy Ghost you can receive another touch from God why because he was present you know there's a song it says In The Presence of Jehovah God Almighty Prince of Peace U I don't know the words for the brother you know the word Sorrows vanish amen H Allelujah so as we behold his face we behold who he really is his person his character the mystery of his being will be revealed in his face amen his innermost Secrets will be revealed in his face when the veil is taken off when the the seals are broken and once again there will be a face t- face Revelation When We Shall Behold his face with the revelation of our identification now in him they are no longer Twain but they are one like husband and wife hallelujah amen flesh and spirit uniting together amen so through all the ages God in type only revealed himself his presence to his election yeah God was showing what he was going to do at the end time his presence come that's why the scripture says he that cometh to God must believe that he is you know now believe is to have that gift is that in that DNA in your soul from God to be able to believe his word must believe that he is in other words that he is real believe that he is a being you know that struck so so strongly when brother Bram mentions it he says God is a being he's not just something ose of light or air but he's a being he's a living reality and that being to conform of human flesh and when he died he rose again and the holy ghost is now with us in us he says I'll be with you even in you until the consumation Hallelujah so we find that people see so uh God was always identified in the midst of his people by his personal Presence by him being in their midst so what happened at the end time is scriptural it has always happened in the other the ages and we find Jacob called the name of the place Pinel for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved and we find even Moses in that Exodus and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar so in other words he came and he spoke through a cloudy pillar so it wasn't the visible face that we've seen in our day but his face to face was him speaking to God in a cloudy pillar in a light in a burning bush because you find that even Moses desire to see the face of God God said but you will not be able to see my face no man can see my face and love you know but you can see my back he amen and here we see the face of God Amen he appeared to us we got our his picture in our in our houses in our rooms everywhere we have the face of God Amen he says yeah sorry he says and it came to pass as Moses entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again unto the camp but his servant Joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle so we find that Israel God's chosen people saw God face to face still not the face to face that we have seen God they saw him in the pillar of fire but yet that face was the presence of God numbers 14:11 and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be here they believe me for all the signs which I have showed them among them I will Smite them with pestilence and disinherit them and will make of Thee a greater nation and a mightier than they and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitant of this land for they have heard that thou Lord art among this people that thou Lord art seen face to face and that thy Cloud standeth over them God always comes in his presence when he comes to deliver his people and he's done exactly the same here at the end time see that the cloud standed over them and that thou goest before them Day by time in a pillar of cloud and a pillar of Fire by night we find even that he spoke on the mount in Deuteronomy 52 and the Lord Our God made a covenant with us in horb the Lord made not this Covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the Lord talked with you face to face in a moment out of the midst of the fire I stood between the Lord and you at that time to show you the word of the Lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up to the Mount saying I am the Lord thy God which brought the out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage today will say I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of denomination that you may be a people unto him that you can walk in his presence see and Deuteronomy 3410 says There Rose not another prophet in the Old Testament who the Lord knew face to face let's read Deuteronomy 34:10 and There Rose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face in all the signs and the Wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all the land but Paul in the New Testament he prophesied in 1 Corinthians 13:12 that the end time church will have a prophet that the Lord will speak to once again face to face let's read in 1 Corinthians 13:12 for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face that is now now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known amen you know him and you also know your identification amen that you were a part of him before the will began you were a part of his plan see so there will come forth a revelation and we shall know as we were known amen there will come a prophet again that will take the veil of the face of God and seven Thunders will utter their voices Amen to give the bride a revelation of how to enter into rapturing faith and here we find in Matthew 11:10 Jesus said let's read Matthew 11 10 for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee so John the Baptist was the one to come and identify and say Behold the Lamb of God he came to introduce the presence of God he was right there he was like all the common people but yet he was Emmanuel God With Us us and here John the Baptist says behold when the Dove came Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he foran the face of God and as John the Baptist foran his face brother Bram was sent in this day with a Ministry before the face again in 1933 in Ohio River the Lord said as John the Baptist was sent to forun my first coming he are sent with a message to forun the second coming of the Lord to unveil the coming lamb and the prophet was the first one to give a description of the face of Jesus Christ it's funny that everybody desired to see the face of God what a privilege we have we can look at the face of God Amen brother brah says yeah and seed is not air with a shock I kicked against the ground stomped my feet a little bit shook my head rugged my hands looked up again looked away looked again and there he was standing there and the wind started to blow and I seen the broom Sage blowing and when it started blowing his garments blew with it like the clothes hanging on a line they begin to flip he was standing there looking at it I thought if I could just get a look look at his face and he was watching East right this away he was watching intensely and I moved to step around to get a close look at his face and I still couldn't see very well and he had his hands in front of him rather hid from where I was standing I moved around again and I cleared my throat something like this to see if I could attract his attention but he never moved and then I thought maybe I'll call him when I said Jesus he turned his head and when he looked at me he just raised his arms out that's all I remember till nearly daylight I was laying right out here somewhere where this place is now in the field my pajama shirt all wet with tears where I'd been crying and I had passed out listen his face had characters that no artist could draw or paint they could not do it he looked like a man that if you would look at him you would cry with sympathy and respect with reverence and yet with enough power that he could speak and would turn the world all over and artist could never catch the characters that's how we should never put anything in that face of the cloud it's a supernatural drawing it's the face of Our Lord because brother Bram says here that no artist could paint the characters or could draw or paint that face Amen brother brah says I never know to this day what that meant but here I am tonight after 30 years standing in an auditorium that's dedicated now to the service of almighty God and me just a lay member really a local Elder in the Baptist Church here of which Roy Davis was pastor at the time and I'm now standing here with a place crowded right over the same grounds what I think is the purchase of the the blood of Jesus Christ himself in my hands to bring this four days message of the Lord H Allelujah do you love him tonight see brother bham was entrusted to reveal Jesus Christ that's why you had to know his face to know him what he looked like CU he was the messenger that was to run before his face you know in closing Moses desire to look upon the face of God in Exodus 33:18 he says I beseech thee show me thy glory and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy to whom I will show mercy and he said thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and love and here we have a big picture of his face you can look at his face a desire that the prophet Moses had a desire that the Saints of old had Lord if you can just look at your face and here we saw his face see and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face Thou shalt not see see that face was for a specific class of people for a specific a designated time was for our time for us to see that face than once the seals are broken now we can have a look at the face of God see if you throw it in Moses time we throw out the continuity of the scripture because that face can only appear once the veil is taken off amen that's why people Through the Ages they have longed to see the face of God they wrote songs about the face of God they wrote poems about the face of God but what a privilege that we've had that he revealed his face to us in this day one songwriter says what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face and tell the story saved by grace and there's another song it says Lord You're beautiful your face is all I see when your eyes on your child Your Grace AB bounds to me and then there's another song here it says yeah someday the silver cord will break and I no more as now shall sing but oh the joy when I shall Wake Within the Palace of The King and I shall see him face to face and tell the story Say by grace and I shall see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace it goes on Someday My Earthly house will fall I cannot tell how soon will be but this I know My All In All has now a place in heaven for me say someday when Fades and Golden Sun Beneath The Rosy tinted West my blessed Lord will say Well done and I shall enter into rest someday till then I'll watch and wait my lamp all trimmed and burning bright that when my savior opens the gates my soul to him may take its fight and I shall see him face to face and tell the story saved by grace as it told this what's his name you know you can now you you get your robe and your crown he says I don't desire a robe and a crown but just let we look at his face for a million years that will be my reward amen God bless you brothers and sisters [Applause] amen what a day that will be when my Jes Jesus I shall see and I look upon his face the one who Sav Me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promis land what a day Glory day that will

Mysteries are revealed down comes the mighty Angel Christ with a rainbow upon his head and he said the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming because it paralleled in every way of John the Baptist introducing the Messiah we have received a message Malachi 4:5 that has introduced the bride to the bridegroom you don't have to wait to see him face to face you can stare at the picture and try to figure it all out out and well maybe I see this and that just say Lord reveal yourself to me I want to see you face to face Lord I want to behold your person Lord I I I want I unveil
