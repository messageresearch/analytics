[11:24] to have them with us and all the others
[11:26] amen god bless you this morning as you
[11:28] invite but in my junior for a psalm
[11:30] reading
[11:40] amen
[11:47] the joys of a small sound booth is
[11:49] shuffling the deck so people can get out
[11:52] good morning you know the thing about
[11:55] this time of year the
[11:57] christmas holidays is it's a time where
[12:01] you know people often will put together
[12:02] a list of things that
[12:05] you know maybe they would hope to
[12:06] receive of their friends or their family
[12:08] or maybe their friends or family are
[12:10] asking for one
[12:11] or you know maybe there's children out
[12:14] there that are putting lists together
[12:16] hoping that they might receive something
[12:20] you know as we turn to psalm 80 this
[12:23] morning
[12:24] verse 1.
[12:27] you know just kind of struck me as i was
[12:29] reading this kind of the first verse
[12:30] there says give ear
[12:33] o shepherd of israel thou that lead us
[12:36] joseph like a flock thou that dwelleth
[12:40] between the cherubims
[12:41] shine forth you know as we
[12:44] read the rest of the psalm which we will
[12:46] this morning
[12:48] you see very quickly that virtually the
[12:49] entire chapter is
[12:52] the prayer of one crying out to this
[12:54] shepherd
[12:56] with a list of all the things
[12:59] that they have need of in verse 3 it
[13:02] says turn us again o god and cause thy
[13:05] face to shine and we shall be saved
[13:08] oh lord how long will thou be angry
[13:10] against the prayer of thy people
[13:13] in verse seven it says turn us again o
[13:15] god of hosts
[13:17] and cause thy face to shine and we shall
[13:19] be saved
[13:20] he goes on in verse 8 to describe this
[13:22] people as a
[13:24] a vine which was once great cast a
[13:26] shadow and was cast down
[13:28] and consumed and burned you know it
[13:31] really is a
[13:32] confession kind of a sad testimony of
[13:35] how a people that was once great
[13:37] now found themselves in desperate need
[13:40] of their shepherd
[13:42] but you know verse this the chapter ends
[13:45] in verse 17 with an interesting
[13:47] statement
[13:48] it says let thy hand be upon the man
[13:53] of thy right hand upon the son of man
[13:56] whom thou madest strong
[13:58] for thyself the man of thy right hand
[14:04] you know and it occurred to me as i was
[14:05] reading through this psalm that if there
[14:06] was ever a christmas list
[14:09] in the scripture this was it this is our
[14:12] list it's uh
[14:14] you know this is uh every year christmas
[14:16] if we think about it what we are
[14:18] celebrating is recognizing how
[14:22] the man at thy right hand brought have
[14:26] brought us everything
[14:28] everything that was accomplished as a
[14:30] result of the appearing
[14:32] of the man at thy right hand
[14:36] and you know what's interesting is every
[14:37] single one of the items on this
[14:38] christmas list
[14:40] was answered by the man at thy right
[14:43] hand
[14:45] you know where it says in verse 1 to
[14:46] give ear o shepherd of israel
[14:50] the man of thy right hand came and
[14:52] declared i am the good shepherd
[14:55] and know my sheep and am known of mine
[14:59] as the father knoweth me even so know i
[15:01] the father
[15:03] and i lay down my life for the sheep
[15:07] for his cry of turn us again
[15:10] he said for as the father raiseth up the
[15:12] dead and quickeneth them
[15:14] even so the son quickeneth whom he will
[15:18] verily verily i say unto you he that
[15:20] heareth my word
[15:22] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[15:24] everlasting life
[15:26] and shall not come in the condemnation
[15:28] but his past
[15:29] from death and to life for his cry for
[15:32] his
[15:33] christmas list to cause thy face to
[15:35] shine
[15:36] the man at thy right hand came and
[15:38] declared he that hath seen me
[15:40] hath seen the father and how sayest thou
[15:44] then show us the father
[15:46] for the broken down vine the man at thy
[15:48] right hand came and declared i am the
[15:50] vine
[15:52] and my father is the husbandman abide in
[15:55] me and i
[15:56] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[15:59] of itself
[16:00] except it abide in the vine no more can
[16:03] ye
[16:03] except you abide in me i am the vine
[16:07] ye are the branches he that abideth in
[16:10] me and i in him the same bringeth forth
[16:12] much fruit
[16:14] that without me you can do nothing
[16:17] you could take this psalm and you could
[16:19] put it right at the beginning of the new
[16:21] testament
[16:21] almost like the prelude of every gift
[16:23] that was about to come
[16:25] you know and as we think about this
[16:27] season
[16:28] you know hopefully as we read this psalm
[16:31] remember that we are recipients
[16:34] of the answer of everything that's on
[16:35] this christmas list
[16:37] that for us christmas is more than about
[16:39] luke 2 but it's just as much about
[16:41] ephesians 2 and colossians 3
[16:43] in romans 5 and 6 and basically
[16:45] everything that follows
[16:46] from the very first of matthew 1. so as
[16:50] we kind of read psalm 80 this morning
[16:51] let's
[16:53] let's rejoice that we have seen the man
[16:55] at thy right hand
[16:57] who has come and delivered everything
[17:00] on this christmas list you know maybe as
[17:04] some celebrate the end of a difficult
[17:07] year
[17:09] maybe we celebrate the receiving of all
[17:12] things
[17:13] let's read psalm 80 together it says
[17:16] this
[17:16] give ear o shepherd of israel thou that
[17:19] leadeth joseph like a flock
[17:22] thou that dwelleth between the cherubs
[17:24] shine forth
[17:25] before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh
[17:28] stir up thy strength
[17:30] and come and save us turn us again o god
[17:33] and cause thy face to shine and we shall
[17:36] be saved
[17:37] oh lord god of hosts how long will thou
[17:40] be angry against the prayer of thy
[17:42] people
[17:43] thou feedeth them with the bread of
[17:45] tears and give us them tears to drink in
[17:47] great measure
[17:48] thou makest us a stripe unto our
[17:50] neighbors and our enemies laugh
[17:52] among themselves turn us again o god of
[17:55] hosts
[17:56] and cause thy face to shine and we shall
[17:59] be saved
[18:00] thou hast brought a vine out of egypt
[18:02] thou hast cast out the heathen and
[18:04] planted it
[18:05] thou preparest room before it and its
[18:08] cast caused to take
[18:09] deep root and it filled the land the
[18:12] hills were covered with the shadow of it
[18:14] and the vows thereof were like the
[18:16] goodly cedars
[18:17] she sent out her vows unto the sea and
[18:20] her branches unto the river
[18:22] why has thou then broken down her hedges
[18:25] so that all they which passed by the way
[18:27] do pluck her
[18:29] the boar out of the wood thoth wasted
[18:31] and the wild beast of the field that
[18:33] devoured
[18:34] return we beseech thee o god of hosts
[18:37] look down from heaven and behold and
[18:39] visit this vine
[18:41] and the vineyard which thy right hand
[18:43] hath planted and the branch that thou
[18:45] made it
[18:45] strong for thyself it is burned with
[18:48] fire
[18:49] it is cut down they perish at the rebuke
[18:51] of thy countenance
[18:53] let thy hand be upon the man of thy
[18:55] right hand
[18:56] upon the son of man whom thou made us
[18:59] strong for thyself
[19:00] so will not we go back from thee quicken
[19:03] us
[19:04] and we will call upon thy name turn us
[19:06] again

[19:10] shine

[32:50] i said what's the real cost like
[32:52] economist would say what's the real cost
[32:54] of serving god
[32:56] so the real cost would have been you
[32:58] know death
[32:59] it would have been you know if you don't
[33:01] serve god then
[33:02] you you reap you know the wickedness of
[33:05] the world
[33:05] and i just you know it was it just done
[33:07] to me and said it pays to serve jesus

[33:14] jesus

[55:35] [Music]
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:14] and thank you very much
[56:22] my whole life's always been i just
[56:28] wanted to share the lord with other
[56:30] people
[56:32] because you know you've heard my
[56:34] testimony but
[56:37] you don't know how dark of a person i
[56:39] was
[56:40] i was really dark and
[56:45] and he just came by one day and
[56:50] it got me and i just don't know how to
[56:53] express that i always loved that song
[56:56] but what really shakes me this morning
[56:59] is
[57:00] how i'm supposed to be a pastor and how
[57:03] you could pull that off without me
[57:04] knowing it
[57:09] that makes me wonder how much is going
[57:11] on i don't
[57:13] i don't know about
[57:17] so i'll try to compose myself
[57:21] this morning i think we're going to have
[57:24] singing
[57:26] this evening i think i hope brother ben
[57:29] and you're you'll be here tonight
[57:30] i surely wanted to have you sing for
[57:34] us so god richly bless you
[57:37] um you know i i appreciated the songs
[57:41] that they sang
[57:43] you know some people call them christmas
[57:45] carols but
[57:47] you know really christmas is really
[57:50] about the lord
[57:52] that's that's what it's supposed to to
[57:55] be
[57:55] and it it's supposed to be uh
[57:59] about him but the world's always trying
[58:02] to substitute
[58:04] you know i was fellowshipping with
[58:05] brother cosman the other day and we were
[58:07] talking about just look at how
[58:10] satan has come in and substituted santa
[58:13] claus for the lord
[58:15] you know you better watch out you better
[58:18] not
[58:19] cry you better not pout
[58:23] i'm telling you why santa claus is
[58:26] coming not jesus
[58:28] is coming but
[58:31] santa claus is coming and then he knows
[58:34] when you're sleeping
[58:36] he knows when you're awake he knows if
[58:38] you've been good or bad
[58:41] you know not the lord knows not he's got
[58:44] his spirits going to and fro
[58:46] he's making a list he's checking it
[58:49] twice
[58:50] santa claus is doing it not the lord
[58:52] going to and fro
[58:54] and marking the sign and kind of the
[58:56] abominations it's
[58:58] it it's sad to see
[59:03] the lord leave
[59:06] uh the lives of mankind and
[59:10] try to go through this world without
[59:13] the lord jesus i i just don't know how
[59:16] somebody does it
[59:17] you know i stumble and fall a lot as it
[59:20] is but
[59:21] i've never seen his hand not extended to
[59:24] me
[59:25] even in the hardest times of my life
[59:27] he's
[59:28] always had his hand out for me
[59:31] and he made a promise i'll never leave
[59:33] you nor forsake you
[59:35] but i'll be with you even until the end
[59:37] and
[59:38] and so uh we we just like to
[59:42] uh it's nice to have mike and ellen with
[59:44] us did they have you stand up
[59:47] you got to stand up
[59:50] [Applause]
[59:58] yes now these these are old friends of
[1:00:01] mine
[1:00:01] and and that's in the trueness of the
[1:00:04] word
[1:00:06] uh so but it's nice to have them i i
[1:00:09] know there's others here and we're
[1:00:11] grateful to have
[1:00:12] uh you uh this morning
[1:00:16] i gotta try to find my composure here
[1:00:18] this morning to start but
[1:00:21] uh we we talked wednesday night and
[1:00:27] we read a scripture so let's go stand
[1:00:30] this morning and
[1:00:32] turn on our bibles to i believe it's
[1:00:36] john
[1:00:38] the gospel of saint john john 3 16
[1:00:43] and
[1:00:48] we'll read this scripture this morning
[1:00:50] and
[1:00:54] and
[1:01:02] am it says for god so loved the world
[1:01:05] he gave his only begotten son
[1:01:10] that whosoever believeth in him
[1:01:13] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:01:17] life
[1:01:18] father bless us this morning please be
[1:01:21] our portion today
[1:01:22] walk in our midst do for us exceedingly
[1:01:26] and abundantly
[1:01:27] about what he can even think or ask
[1:01:30] we ask it in jesus name amen god bless
[1:01:33] you may be seated
[1:01:39] uh last wednesday night we uh
[1:01:42] ministered a little bit about the gift
[1:01:46] of god
[1:01:47] and we saw in the scriptures that
[1:01:51] as we read that the first
[1:01:54] christmas gift we called our sermon the
[1:01:57] first christmas gift
[1:01:59] and we went to the book of
[1:02:02] hebrews the first and second chapter
[1:02:05] of the book of hebrews to describe the
[1:02:08] first christmas gift
[1:02:10] the first christmas gift that was ever
[1:02:13] given
[1:02:14] and and when we began to describe it it
[1:02:17] seemed to be
[1:02:18] such a wonderful description and we saw
[1:02:22] in hebrews
[1:02:22] that said talking of this gift this gift
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:27] the lord gave us and it you know when
[1:02:30] someone gives you a gift
[1:02:32] you've got to take possession of that
[1:02:34] gift it's it's yours
[1:02:37] it's yours and god gave his
[1:02:41] son to us he so loved us
[1:02:44] he gave us his son so he gave us
[1:02:47] this gift it was a gift and it was a
[1:02:51] gift to you
[1:02:52] it wasn't a gift about something to look
[1:02:55] at it was a personal gift
[1:02:57] from the father in heaven to you
[1:03:00] personally
[1:03:01] he gave you his son and when he gave you
[1:03:05] his son he didn't give you
[1:03:07] part of his son he didn't give you a
[1:03:11] just a story book
[1:03:14] about his son you know most people have
[1:03:16] just received a storybook
[1:03:19] about the lord you know like you give a
[1:03:21] book and
[1:03:22] but he gave himself he gave his only
[1:03:25] begotten son and he didn't give part of
[1:03:28] them
[1:03:28] he gave all of them he gave everything
[1:03:31] that he was
[1:03:33] he gave to you everything every
[1:03:36] part of what he possessed was in that
[1:03:39] gift it was a full gift
[1:03:42] and that's what a gift was and that gift
[1:03:45] uh had eternal life and so as we thought
[1:03:48] about that gift we went to hebrews
[1:03:51] the first and second chapter so that we
[1:03:54] could
[1:03:54] really see what this gift was
[1:03:58] because it's terrible to get a gift and
[1:04:00] you don't know what it does
[1:04:02] and i used the example of i
[1:04:05] i bought leslie a car for her birthday
[1:04:09] we needed a car
[1:04:10] and so i believe in killing two birds
[1:04:12] with one stone so
[1:04:14] i went out and bought her a car for her
[1:04:16] uh
[1:04:19] her birthday and you know we had the car
[1:04:23] it's a 215 model i believe
[1:04:27] or 16 something like that and so
[1:04:30] we had it for a couple years and i
[1:04:32] thought
[1:04:33] i i'm gonna get her remote start
[1:04:38] on her car so that she can press a
[1:04:40] button and the car will start up
[1:04:42] and it can warm up for so when i have to
[1:04:45] get in with her the car will be worn
[1:04:49] and so you know how you buy people a
[1:04:52] gift for yourself
[1:04:56] so you know i i i mentioned to ernest
[1:05:00] and aaron
[1:05:01] i want to because he's got a car similar
[1:05:04] i said
[1:05:04] i want to put remote start on your mom's
[1:05:08] car
[1:05:09] and he looked at us like
[1:05:12] we were crazy and i said yeah you know
[1:05:16] why don't you think that's a good idea
[1:05:18] says dad it's already got it
[1:05:21] and it went and pressed the button and
[1:05:23] pressed the button and the car started
[1:05:25] two years i didn't know
[1:05:28] what was all in the gift
[1:05:33] and i think that's a lot of what happens
[1:05:35] with us we don't know
[1:05:37] all that's in the gift of god we don't
[1:05:40] all
[1:05:40] know we haven't encompassed
[1:05:43] uh and and taken the time
[1:05:47] to go it i think it's a thing of of
[1:05:50] human nature you know that you never
[1:05:52] you never read the instructions you know
[1:05:55] you just go try to put it together
[1:05:58] yourself
[1:05:59] you know and maybe it doesn't come
[1:06:01] together just right and that
[1:06:03] but you learned to live with it but if
[1:06:05] you'd sit down
[1:06:07] and you'd read all about it and find out
[1:06:10] what it does
[1:06:10] you know and i got a confection of and i
[1:06:14] still don't know how that works
[1:06:17] because i haven't taken the time to
[1:06:20] really
[1:06:20] find out all that was in the gift so we
[1:06:24] just
[1:06:24] went through the first couple chapters
[1:06:26] of hebrew said
[1:06:28] and and describing this gift that god
[1:06:31] gave us
[1:06:32] and you know in one of the verses in
[1:06:34] hebrews
[1:06:35] the first chapter
[1:06:39] and the third verse it says that this
[1:06:42] gift
[1:06:43] was the brightness of his glory
[1:06:47] now think of that god gave you this gift
[1:06:49] and what he gave you
[1:06:51] was the brightness of his glory
[1:06:55] that's his gift to you the brightness of
[1:06:58] his glory
[1:06:59] just think how much he must have loved
[1:07:01] you to give your son the brightness of
[1:07:03] his glory
[1:07:05] and the expressed image of
[1:07:08] his person so if god is giving you
[1:07:12] his son he gave you himself
[1:07:16] because we realized when god created the
[1:07:19] heavens and earth
[1:07:21] that he didn't create them by using
[1:07:24] other things
[1:07:25] he created them by using himself
[1:07:29] they they were him he took out of
[1:07:32] himself
[1:07:33] and took out of what that he was
[1:07:37] his his nature his thoughts his
[1:07:40] attributes his person
[1:07:41] no wonder the invisible things of god
[1:07:44] can be clearly seen
[1:07:45] in the visible things around us so he he
[1:07:48] went
[1:07:49] and gave us himself and so now
[1:07:52] we find out in him giving us his son
[1:07:55] jesus
[1:07:56] he gave us the expressed image of his
[1:07:59] person
[1:08:00] in other words he gave us his
[1:08:02] personality
[1:08:05] how many people do you go through life
[1:08:07] knowing but you don't really know
[1:08:10] and then you get an opportunity to sit
[1:08:13] down
[1:08:13] and and and just have them open their
[1:08:17] heart to you and open their feelings and
[1:08:19] and the burdens that they carry and what
[1:08:22] they've went through in life
[1:08:24] okay and and you look upon them and
[1:08:27] your whole your whole attitude towards
[1:08:30] them changes
[1:08:32] you know you begin to find out you know
[1:08:34] why this person was
[1:08:36] was abused as a child and
[1:08:39] and you know and and they never had
[1:08:42] anything
[1:08:43] and uh uh you know finally
[1:08:46] uh the lord come on their life and
[1:08:49] they've always had these struggles
[1:08:51] and you know you're sitting there after
[1:08:52] a while in your hearts
[1:08:54] just going out to him because
[1:08:58] you you now you really see him you know
[1:09:00] them as a person
[1:09:03] and you can't know jesus as an object
[1:09:08] you've got to know him as a person
[1:09:11] you can't know him as a historical
[1:09:13] figure you know i heard george
[1:09:15] washington cross the delaware but i
[1:09:16] don't know george washington
[1:09:20] you know i heard abraham lincoln
[1:09:22] preached a great thing the emancipation
[1:09:25] proclamation
[1:09:26] but i don't know abraham lincoln
[1:09:31] you know but i would hate to say that
[1:09:34] jesus
[1:09:36] spoke to beatitudes and and
[1:09:40] spoke these things and say but i don't
[1:09:43] know
[1:09:43] jesus wouldn't that be a sad thing but
[1:09:48] but to know him is life
[1:09:52] and life everlasting to know the person
[1:09:56] that can and that's what the gift of god
[1:09:59] was was god
[1:10:00] gave mankind his personality
[1:10:04] no no don't look it as a separate gift
[1:10:06] in other words he gave god
[1:10:08] god gave us his personality that we
[1:10:11] could have
[1:10:12] that personality
[1:10:16] so we looked at it and we went through
[1:10:18] it and it was the brightness of his
[1:10:19] coming
[1:10:20] the expressed image of his person
[1:10:23] and and be uphold and upholding
[1:10:27] all things by
[1:10:31] the word of his power
[1:10:34] what he gave us is upholding in other
[1:10:36] words
[1:10:37] everything's here in its place
[1:10:41] because of the power of his word
[1:10:44] when he withdraws his word things
[1:10:47] is going to be very bad
[1:10:51] the stars will come crashing down i'll
[1:10:53] tell you what'll happen when he
[1:10:54] withdraws his
[1:10:55] word from this land they'll it'll turn
[1:10:58] into a new heavens
[1:11:00] and a new earth okay and
[1:11:03] and it says uh in upholdeth all things
[1:11:09] by the word of his power when he had
[1:11:12] by himself purged our sins
[1:11:18] he did it all by himself no help
[1:11:21] nobody else nothing he alone
[1:11:25] purged our sins and sat down
[1:11:28] at the right hand of the majesty on high
[1:11:32] this is what he gave you
[1:11:35] he gave you the one that's sitting
[1:11:38] on the throne of the majesty of high
[1:11:42] he's yours
[1:11:44] you have him you ever hear the
[1:11:46] expression it's not
[1:11:48] what you know but it's who you know
[1:11:51] well just think who it is that you have
[1:11:56] as a friend as a savior so we're just
[1:11:59] talking about
[1:12:00] this great gift and then we we read on
[1:12:03] and
[1:12:04] and how that he he wasn't uh
[1:12:08] just an angel some supernatural
[1:12:13] uh angelic uh being that
[1:12:16] that uh isn't uh uh couldn't be
[1:12:20] touched by our affirmatives
[1:12:23] but that he was he was a made a
[1:12:27] king of kings and lord of lords and he
[1:12:30] had the sepulchre in his hand
[1:12:34] so he was telling me he says that this
[1:12:36] isn't an angel
[1:12:38] this is the son of god he didn't give
[1:12:41] you an angel
[1:12:43] to something that wasn't important to
[1:12:46] him
[1:12:46] something that he just didn't love you
[1:12:49] know just like we said
[1:12:51] it's like if you have a great event at
[1:12:54] and you and invite somebody
[1:12:57] up let's say it's a some great
[1:13:02] crowning of a king or some great uh
[1:13:06] formal event you know you want the top
[1:13:10] person there
[1:13:12] you know like if the president goes to
[1:13:14] an event
[1:13:15] then that's a great event but if the
[1:13:17] president doesn't think that event's
[1:13:20] so great he sends the vice president
[1:13:24] and then if it's really kind of down on
[1:13:26] the ladder
[1:13:27] he sends the ambassador
[1:13:30] you know i mean but this
[1:13:34] gift wasn't even an
[1:13:37] angel it was above an angel this was the
[1:13:39] son of god
[1:13:40] this was the person of god this was god
[1:13:44] that the one that had the sepulcher in
[1:13:46] his hand
[1:13:47] and sat on the right hand of the throne
[1:13:49] of god who had power and authority
[1:13:52] and dominion and all things were subject
[1:13:56] to him
[1:13:59] and that's who he sent and and he said
[1:14:02] he was
[1:14:03] in the ninth verse he says and thou
[1:14:06] hath love righteousness and hateth
[1:14:08] iniquity
[1:14:09] therefore god even thy god hath anointed
[1:14:13] thee with oil
[1:14:14] of gladness and uh
[1:14:17] of fellows and it says
[1:14:21] and thou lord in the beginning
[1:14:25] hath laid the foundations of the earth
[1:14:28] and the heavens are the work of thy
[1:14:32] hands
[1:14:32] think about this gift
[1:14:36] that god gave you
[1:14:39] it is not a shabby gift
[1:14:44] in other words he gave you the lord
[1:14:47] of glory the one who has
[1:14:51] judgment in his hand the sepulcher
[1:14:55] of righteousness that's who he was and
[1:14:58] then he makes this beautiful statement
[1:15:00] he says he says
[1:15:04] and doubt o lord in the beginning
[1:15:07] layeth the foundations of the earth
[1:15:11] and the heavens are the work of thy
[1:15:14] hands
[1:15:15] now listen to this gift you've got
[1:15:18] and they shall perish
[1:15:22] but that remaineth they shall wax
[1:15:25] old as death of garment and as a
[1:15:29] vestiger
[1:15:30] shall thou fold them up and they shall
[1:15:33] be
[1:15:34] changed but thou art the same
[1:15:38] and thy years shall not fail
[1:15:41] you got a gift that's not going to get
[1:15:43] old
[1:15:44] it's not going to run out it's not going
[1:15:46] to go out of style
[1:15:51] you know it's it's the real thing
[1:15:54] and and so we just went down and and
[1:15:57] then we
[1:15:58] we went over and talked about this great
[1:16:00] gift of god
[1:16:02] being uh uh of what he said in
[1:16:07] in the third verse of the second chapter
[1:16:09] he says how shall we escape
[1:16:11] if we neglect such a great salvation
[1:16:14] which at the first begin to be spoken
[1:16:18] by the lord and was confirmed
[1:16:21] unto us by them that heard them
[1:16:24] so he he's saying
[1:16:27] what did he speak of he spoke of another
[1:16:30] kingdom
[1:16:31] he spoke of another life and of eternal
[1:16:34] life
[1:16:35] and he said i'm the gift of god i'm
[1:16:38] what's going to
[1:16:39] come in and and you're going to receive
[1:16:43] me
[1:16:43] and now this gift this if that same
[1:16:47] spirit that was in christ jesus dwell in
[1:16:49] you
[1:16:50] it will also quicken your mortal body
[1:16:53] so you possess now a gift of eternal
[1:16:56] life
[1:16:57] you possess what will take you out of
[1:16:59] the grave you possess
[1:17:01] what will transform your body it's not
[1:17:04] something you
[1:17:04] know about
[1:17:08] this isn't a gift coupon
[1:17:12] that you can lose
[1:17:17] this is the real thing this is something
[1:17:20] you possess
[1:17:21] today it's been given to you okay and if
[1:17:24] you say well burma gary i don't know if
[1:17:26] i have that gift
[1:17:27] it's here for you to get
[1:17:31] it's here to receive let me tell you
[1:17:34] there's
[1:17:34] nothing anywhere that compares to the
[1:17:38] lord jesus
[1:17:41] his magnificent can his love
[1:17:45] and his ability is beyond the
[1:17:49] comprehension of men
[1:17:52] he's so he's he
[1:17:55] you can't even describe them
[1:17:59] and you have this gift this morning
[1:18:02] i'm not putting you in question i'm
[1:18:04] saying god's given you this gift
[1:18:06] but maybe you've never opened it or
[1:18:09] maybe you've never seen all that's in
[1:18:11] there for you
[1:18:12] and all that it can do for you
[1:18:16] you might be up against the wall with
[1:18:18] finance you might be up against the wall
[1:18:20] with health
[1:18:21] you might be up against the wall with
[1:18:23] anything but in this gift
[1:18:27] it possesses all that you have need of
[1:18:32] and like you said he says in the fifth
[1:18:35] verse it says
[1:18:36] and unto the angels hath he not put them
[1:18:39] subject but the the world to come
[1:18:44] of the world to come therefore we speak
[1:18:48] and so he he he's the one that told us
[1:18:52] about
[1:18:52] a world to come he plays the one that
[1:18:55] told us in my father's house are many
[1:18:57] mansions
[1:18:59] and i would not tell you if it wasn't so
[1:19:02] and i go to prepare a place for you
[1:19:06] that where i am you may be also
[1:19:09] this is the gift that god gave us
[1:19:14] as we're just moving along just going
[1:19:16] over wednesday
[1:19:18] tonight's service it
[1:19:21] and then he says but you know he was
[1:19:23] made a little lower than the angels
[1:19:26] seventh verse thou crownest him
[1:19:30] with glory and honor and didn't set him
[1:19:34] over the works of thy hands now listen
[1:19:37] to this this is the gift you have
[1:19:40] now if you could ever understand it as
[1:19:42] your possession
[1:19:46] we always preach it all the time that
[1:19:48] we're his possession
[1:19:50] and we are his possession because he
[1:19:54] bought us with the price but
[1:19:57] in buying us with a price listen to what
[1:20:00] that he did
[1:20:02] he says thou hath put all things
[1:20:06] in subjection under his feet
[1:20:10] for in that he put
[1:20:13] all in subjection under him
[1:20:17] he left nothing that is not
[1:20:20] put under him so you have somebody who
[1:20:24] is in charge
[1:20:25] of everything
[1:20:29] and listen to this but now we see
[1:20:33] not yet all things put under him
[1:20:36] we don't we haven't even seen all the
[1:20:38] things that are under his foot
[1:20:42] look at the things we're seeing in our
[1:20:44] age i don't care what they come up with
[1:20:46] he's king of kings he's lord of lords
[1:20:49] he's a lord of glory all things are in
[1:20:52] his hands and we're in his hands
[1:20:54] and nothing can pluck us out nothing can
[1:20:57] pluck us out
[1:21:00] you talk about a gift what a wonderful
[1:21:03] gift
[1:21:04] and so we see that he's that this gift
[1:21:07] it wasn't an angel it was the one who
[1:21:10] was in control of
[1:21:12] everything in charge of everything
[1:21:15] he had the sepulcher of righteousness
[1:21:17] sat on the right hand of god
[1:21:20] but he came
[1:21:23] lower than the angels
[1:21:28] this is how important he made this gift
[1:21:31] personal to you
[1:21:37] in the ninth verse but we see jesus
[1:21:40] who has made little lower the angels for
[1:21:43] the suffering of
[1:21:44] death and crowned with
[1:21:47] glory and honor that he
[1:21:51] by the grace of god should taste
[1:21:54] death for every man
[1:21:58] for it became
[1:22:01] him for whom are
[1:22:05] all things all things are of him
[1:22:08] and who by all things in bringing
[1:22:12] many sons unto glory
[1:22:15] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:22:19] perfect through suffering
[1:22:23] oh my he suffered and and let's we'll
[1:22:26] just finish on this part
[1:22:29] and it says he says
[1:22:32] for both he that sanctifieth
[1:22:36] and they who are sanctified
[1:22:39] are all one for which cause
[1:22:43] he is not ashamed to call them
[1:22:46] brethren now we see this gift
[1:22:49] how it condenscended what it really was
[1:22:52] but it came down to suffer
[1:22:55] to take on death for us all so he took
[1:22:59] death so because he took death we don't
[1:23:02] have to take death
[1:23:04] you say oh you mean die let me tell you
[1:23:06] something
[1:23:08] watching this body pass away
[1:23:14] is nothing if we really could understand
[1:23:19] where that person is in glory
[1:23:26] and he makes that beautiful statement
[1:23:30] and and so we we saw
[1:23:33] that uh he he became
[1:23:36] he became uh lower than the angels in
[1:23:40] fact he became one of us
[1:23:43] so we could we could see the greatness
[1:23:45] of this gift
[1:23:46] and then in the 14th verse he says
[1:23:50] for so much as then as the children are
[1:23:53] partakers of flesh and blood
[1:23:56] he also himself likewise
[1:24:00] took part of the same
[1:24:03] that through death he might destroy
[1:24:07] him that hath the power
[1:24:10] of death that is
[1:24:13] the devil
[1:24:17] just think that's your gift
[1:24:22] we got to get rid of religion people
[1:24:25] we we've got to get and i'm going to go
[1:24:27] into that a little bit but we've got to
[1:24:29] get rid of religion we've got to get rid
[1:24:31] of worshipping him in ceremonies
[1:24:35] and and and worship him with creeds and
[1:24:39] and dogmas and intellectual thinking
[1:24:42] and and and creating concepts
[1:24:46] in our mind of what he is and what he
[1:24:49] isn't
[1:24:49] and what's transpiring and what's not
[1:24:52] transpiring
[1:24:53] and what's truth and what's not truth
[1:24:55] let me tell you something
[1:24:56] you can know jesus christ as
[1:25:00] a person
[1:25:04] and he's unchanging he doesn't change
[1:25:08] he's the same yesterday
[1:25:10] today and forever you can fold up the
[1:25:13] the worlds like a garment
[1:25:15] okay you can that gets old you can
[1:25:18] put it away but he does not change when
[1:25:22] you know
[1:25:22] him you know life and you know life more
[1:25:26] abundantly
[1:25:27] and when we can start living
[1:25:31] with him and by him
[1:25:36] you know when you've got him in your
[1:25:37] heart and you know that you possess him
[1:25:40] you don't care what someone believes you
[1:25:43] don't care what they criticize
[1:25:45] you don't care if they don't see it the
[1:25:47] way that you see it
[1:25:49] because you're not in control and your
[1:25:52] mind's not in control and your emotions
[1:25:55] aren't in control
[1:25:56] you've given up that control tower to
[1:25:58] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:26:01] you're in fellowship with him and paul
[1:26:04] said
[1:26:04] you don't know me by enticing words you
[1:26:07] know me by the power
[1:26:09] and the demonstration of jesus christ
[1:26:12] the same yesterday and forever
[1:26:14] and they'll know that you are my
[1:26:16] disciples by the
[1:26:17] love that you have one for another
[1:26:21] that's why a root of bitterness
[1:26:25] defiles many how can you have the gift
[1:26:31] of eternal life and know your internally
[1:26:35] secure
[1:26:37] and no nothing can pluck you out
[1:26:40] of the palm of his hand
[1:26:43] to know that he broods over you
[1:26:48] and he watches over you and he won't
[1:26:51] leave you nor forsake you and then you
[1:26:55] be worried
[1:26:58] what someone's going to do to you
[1:27:02] for what ten years two years three years
[1:27:05] four years
[1:27:06] how does that compare to eternal life
[1:27:11] you know if you've got the holy spirit
[1:27:14] you've got the love of god shed abroad
[1:27:18] in your heart that's what you have
[1:27:22] that's what he was said if i know all
[1:27:25] the mysteries and i speak with
[1:27:27] the tongues of men and angels and i
[1:27:30] understand all these great things
[1:27:32] and i don't have that love that he is
[1:27:35] it profiteth me nothing
[1:27:39] you know you just got a great big
[1:27:41] intellectual head scratch
[1:27:44] but i'll tell you if you've been
[1:27:45] purchased out of that dark place
[1:27:49] and you know that he's loved you and you
[1:27:52] can
[1:27:53] look down through the time of all the
[1:27:55] times he's kept you and
[1:27:56] all the things that he's done for you
[1:27:58] and you open
[1:28:00] up your history book like that king went
[1:28:02] and one night he couldn't sleep so he
[1:28:05] got out the chronicles and he he began
[1:28:07] to read and he saw where this
[1:28:09] uh person his name slips me but where he
[1:28:12] done a certain great thing and he said
[1:28:14] go get this guy
[1:28:16] go reward this guy god's not slack he
[1:28:19] doesn't forget your labor of love
[1:28:24] oh my i just think of this but i'm
[1:28:27] thinking it today
[1:28:29] as a gift and we're just going to close
[1:28:31] right here not close the service
[1:28:33] but just and he says that and
[1:28:37] and listen to this 15th verse
[1:28:41] and delivered them who
[1:28:44] through fear of death
[1:28:48] were all their lifetimes
[1:28:52] subject to bondage
[1:28:56] all their life have you ever met
[1:28:58] somebody's afraid to die
[1:29:02] it's a sad thing
[1:29:06] they struggle but he's got rid of that
[1:29:09] oh death where's your sting oh grave
[1:29:13] where's your victory i have a crown
[1:29:15] waiting for me in glory
[1:29:17] i've run a good race i've ran a good
[1:29:20] fight i'm on my way to pick up my crown
[1:29:22] don't don't cry for me
[1:29:27] i've got the gift you've been given the
[1:29:31] gift i just say this morning
[1:29:32] i think maybe we need just to sit down
[1:29:35] somewhere and
[1:29:36] open it up and see all that it has all
[1:29:40] the joy it has
[1:29:41] all the peace it has a joy that
[1:29:44] that is unspeakable and full of glory a
[1:29:48] peace that surpasses understanding
[1:29:50] something that you know okay it may all
[1:29:52] fall apart
[1:29:53] yeah and then we closed we were just
[1:29:56] talking about this gift
[1:29:59] and so we came down
[1:30:03] and it said he said this and we'll read
[1:30:06] the
[1:30:06] 17th and 18th verse it says wherefore in
[1:30:10] all things it behooved him
[1:30:14] to be made like an un to his
[1:30:17] brethren see he wasn't made
[1:30:20] uh something else he was made after the
[1:30:23] seed of abraham
[1:30:24] he says to be made like and unto his
[1:30:27] brethren
[1:30:30] that he might be merciful
[1:30:34] and faithful high priest in
[1:30:37] all things pertaining to god
[1:30:40] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:30:44] the people
[1:30:45] for in that in other words
[1:30:49] for in that in the the fact that he
[1:30:52] became one of us
[1:30:57] the fact that he became one as in that
[1:31:00] in that he became
[1:31:03] one of us and
[1:31:06] he himself had suffered
[1:31:10] being tempted
[1:31:14] so he wasn't tempted in every way that
[1:31:16] we were tempted
[1:31:19] so this gift knows you
[1:31:22] and he became in such a way that you
[1:31:26] could know him
[1:31:30] so he's not something that you can't
[1:31:32] know
[1:31:33] he's not something you can't experience
[1:31:36] he's not somebody who doesn't understand
[1:31:38] because he's an angel no it behooved
[1:31:42] them
[1:31:43] to become a brethren and to suffer
[1:31:46] and to be tempted so that we could know
[1:31:49] that this gift as great and as powerful
[1:31:51] as it was
[1:31:52] if he came to a place that he could
[1:31:55] fellowship with him
[1:31:59] and he says this he says contempted
[1:32:03] so because he was made a brethren
[1:32:07] and made flesh like us and because he
[1:32:10] was tempted
[1:32:11] and like us he is able to
[1:32:15] secure them that are tempted
[1:32:19] you said what does that mean it means he
[1:32:21] is
[1:32:22] able to assist
[1:32:26] and support in times of hardship
[1:32:30] and distress he is able amen
[1:32:34] to do that that's the gift
[1:32:39] that we have now i'd like to call this
[1:32:43] morning service
[1:32:46] if i could and
[1:32:49] we know that in romans
[1:32:52] 6 and 33
[1:32:56] the scripture says the wages of
[1:32:59] sin is death but the gift of god
[1:33:03] is eternal life through christ jesus
[1:33:07] this is what you have amen okay
[1:33:11] in in ephesians 2
[1:33:14] 8-9 and it says it says
[1:33:18] by for by grace ye are saved through
[1:33:22] faith
[1:33:23] not of yourselves but is a gift of god
[1:33:27] amen of god not of works lest any man
[1:33:31] should boast so we understand
[1:33:34] what this gift is
[1:33:37] and and so we we see this
[1:33:40] great gift of god and now
[1:33:44] i want to talk this morning about
[1:33:48] the first re-gifters
[1:33:55] the first re-gifters
[1:33:58] we pulled out something the other day
[1:34:02] at the house and somebody had given it
[1:34:04] to me and
[1:34:06] and i i i looked at it and i i said well
[1:34:09] i think i
[1:34:10] maybe we just ought to give that to such
[1:34:13] and such
[1:34:14] i was going to regift it of course then
[1:34:18] leslie looked at me he says are you sure
[1:34:19] that's not the person that gave it to
[1:34:21] you
[1:34:26] and i thought you know
[1:34:29] i'm not sure
[1:34:32] but i want to talk about the first
[1:34:35] re-gifters another word someone
[1:34:40] that received the gift and then
[1:34:44] regifted it they gave
[1:34:47] what they got and they
[1:34:50] regifted it as somebody else
[1:34:53] you know we we see probably one of the
[1:34:56] first
[1:34:57] re-gifters in the
[1:35:01] in this bible was in saint john
[1:35:05] the fourth chapter in in the gospel
[1:35:09] of saint john in the fourth chapter and
[1:35:12] i
[1:35:13] just as we bring this uh
[1:35:17] in the 10th verse
[1:35:21] and listen to what jesus tells the story
[1:35:25] of the woman at the well he says jesus
[1:35:28] answered
[1:35:29] and said unto her if thou knowest
[1:35:32] the gift of god and who it
[1:35:36] is that saith to thee
[1:35:40] give me to drink that would have
[1:35:43] asked of him and he would give the
[1:35:46] living water now
[1:35:50] when we follow the story down
[1:35:54] right and she finally uh uh
[1:35:58] recognized uh all
[1:36:01] that had taken place and
[1:36:04] and and and everything we see that this
[1:36:08] woman
[1:36:10] was so moved upon
[1:36:13] that what she received she ran into the
[1:36:17] city
[1:36:19] and said come see a man who telleth me
[1:36:22] all things is this
[1:36:24] not the messiah amen she began
[1:36:29] to re-gift
[1:36:33] and if we go to the book of on the
[1:36:36] book of acts and we'll just talk about
[1:36:38] some of these things
[1:36:39] a little bit is that we know on the day
[1:36:42] of pentecost
[1:36:44] these these men came out
[1:36:47] and they were moved on the spirit they
[1:36:49] had received what god had promised them
[1:36:54] they had the gift of god go there and
[1:36:57] tarry
[1:36:58] to the gift of the holy ghost till you
[1:37:00] receive the gift of the spirit of god
[1:37:02] the gift of the holy ghost
[1:37:04] go way back till you get what i've been
[1:37:06] talking
[1:37:07] to you about and
[1:37:11] when they came out and the people said
[1:37:14] they're drunk he says no
[1:37:16] this is what was promised this was a
[1:37:18] gift of god he said he would pour out
[1:37:21] his spirit
[1:37:22] and they began to regift it
[1:37:28] they were trying to give to them
[1:37:33] what they possessed and it
[1:37:36] it it it's beautiful when you
[1:37:39] realize and they begin to understand
[1:37:43] that it was given to them
[1:37:48] so they could re-gift
[1:37:54] when he sent them out in matthew and
[1:37:56] matthew
[1:37:58] 10 and 8 he said go and do all these
[1:38:00] works pray for the sick
[1:38:02] cleanse the leopards raise the dead
[1:38:07] he said freely it was given freely give
[1:38:12] now i don't i it's important
[1:38:15] that you don't put yourself in the eyes
[1:38:19] of condemnation
[1:38:24] because you have a gift
[1:38:27] that fixes condemnation
[1:38:30] if your heart condemns you he is greater
[1:38:34] than your heart
[1:38:38] because when you start talking about
[1:38:42] signs and wonders people always think
[1:38:44] that they should
[1:38:45] they should uh be doing some kinds of
[1:38:49] works you don't do the works
[1:38:51] because you're trying to prove anything
[1:38:54] if you've got the gift you've got the
[1:38:56] gift
[1:39:01] you know someone gives you something you
[1:39:05] know
[1:39:05] you've got it the people can talk until
[1:39:08] they're blue in the face and say
[1:39:10] you don't got it
[1:39:14] you know i remember i bought something i
[1:39:16] thought i bought the last one
[1:39:19] and someone else says no i bought the
[1:39:21] last one
[1:39:23] i thought how many people bought the
[1:39:24] last one
[1:39:28] you know but i knew i had it what i had
[1:39:31] it didn't matter whether it was first
[1:39:33] last or what i knew what i got
[1:39:36] i knew it was mine it was my
[1:39:39] possession and so we we turn it over and
[1:39:42] this is such a beautiful
[1:39:44] little place here in the scriptures
[1:39:50] and peter and them are going up to the
[1:39:53] temple
[1:39:56] and a certain man lame
[1:39:59] from his mother's womb was carried
[1:40:03] whom they laid daily at the gate
[1:40:06] of the temple which is called beautiful
[1:40:10] to ask alms of them that entered into
[1:40:12] the temple
[1:40:14] who's seen peter and john about
[1:40:18] to go into the temple and ask in
[1:40:21] all and peter fastened his
[1:40:25] eyes upon him with john
[1:40:28] and said look on us so he was looking to
[1:40:32] receive
[1:40:34] something so now
[1:40:37] peter's there and he says
[1:40:40] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:40:44] receive
[1:40:45] something of them
[1:40:50] now here he is the guy wants an arm
[1:40:54] but peter's got something
[1:40:59] they had something and they knew
[1:41:03] it was different from what others had
[1:41:07] they saw the need for the gift
[1:41:13] so can they look at this man and they
[1:41:16] know that they have something that he
[1:41:18] doesn't have
[1:41:21] they've got the gift they've got the
[1:41:24] gift of eternal life
[1:41:26] they've got the gift of the majesty they
[1:41:28] got the gift of the one that has all
[1:41:30] things subject to him
[1:41:32] that's the gift that's what they possess
[1:41:34] they just were in the upper room
[1:41:36] and they received that gift they were
[1:41:38] filled with that gift
[1:41:40] they knew they had that gift this guy's
[1:41:43] asking for an
[1:41:44] home
[1:41:47] but look at what they say
[1:41:51] just receive them and peter said i'm in
[1:41:53] silver and gold
[1:41:55] have i none
[1:42:06] but such as i have
[1:42:11] i re-gift it to thee
[1:42:17] in the name of jesus of nazareth rise up
[1:42:21] and walk
[1:42:24] do you understand he possessed it
[1:42:28] so he was the first re-gifter
[1:42:33] this is what i've got i'm going to give
[1:42:35] it
[1:42:36] to begin to see that they became the
[1:42:40] first
[1:42:40] re-gifters giving what they received
[1:42:45] they knew what they had and they knew
[1:42:48] what the person didn't have
[1:42:53] so just think of that as we just look at
[1:42:55] a couple more characters
[1:42:57] here and so we know the story
[1:43:00] it's a great story and so the people
[1:43:03] came up
[1:43:04] and all the people marveled this thing
[1:43:07] was great this guy was there every day
[1:43:10] and these two guys come up
[1:43:15] and this guy says
[1:43:18] he said i don't got silver and gold
[1:43:21] but i have something and i'm
[1:43:24] commissioned
[1:43:26] to re-gift it
[1:43:30] now understand that this morning
[1:43:33] you're commissioned if it was freely
[1:43:37] given
[1:43:38] freely give us
[1:43:42] this this gift didn't have anything to
[1:43:45] do with selfishness
[1:43:47] because it was the personality
[1:43:50] of god that you receive let this mind be
[1:43:54] in you
[1:43:54] which was also in christ jesus let every
[1:43:57] man
[1:43:58] look upon the needs of others other than
[1:44:01] himself
[1:44:02] so when he saw this and he saw this need
[1:44:05] and he knew that he possessed something
[1:44:08] that this other guy
[1:44:09] didn't possess he wanted to re-gift what
[1:44:13] he had
[1:44:14] to him
[1:44:17] they were re-gifters
[1:44:21] that's one thing a christian is he's a
[1:44:24] re-gifter
[1:44:28] it's been freely given to freely give
[1:44:33] okay and so all the people begin to
[1:44:36] wonder
[1:44:36] and then peter says and when peter saw
[1:44:40] it
[1:44:41] he answered unto the people's 12th verse
[1:44:44] ye men of israel why marvel ye
[1:44:47] at this or why look
[1:44:50] so earnestly on us as though by our
[1:44:54] own power or holiness we had made this
[1:44:57] man one
[1:44:59] though we didn't do this ourselves we
[1:45:02] regifted
[1:45:03] something that we got from the father
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:11] was in my glory and it goes on and he
[1:45:14] starts to explain
[1:45:16] and we we if we just read down it it
[1:45:18] says you know god the father of abraham
[1:45:20] and isaac and jacob
[1:45:23] the god of our fathers hath glorified
[1:45:26] his son jesus
[1:45:27] whom delivered up and denied him
[1:45:32] in the presence of pilate when he was
[1:45:35] determined to let him go
[1:45:38] now he's putting it back on him a little
[1:45:40] bit
[1:45:42] this is who did this the guy you
[1:45:45] rejected
[1:45:47] but i just watched this and it goes down
[1:45:49] we won't read it but if
[1:45:50] if you would just read down he talks
[1:45:52] about how they killed him
[1:45:54] and and how he made his name and he
[1:45:56] comes down
[1:45:57] it's in the 18th verse he says but those
[1:46:00] things
[1:46:01] which god beforehand showed
[1:46:04] by the mouth of all his prophets that
[1:46:07] christ
[1:46:08] should suffer
[1:46:13] he hath so fulfilled
[1:46:17] and i like with peter he talks to him
[1:46:21] and
[1:46:21] he says i know you guys did these things
[1:46:24] ignorantly
[1:46:26] he says but so listen when he says
[1:46:28] repent ye therefore
[1:46:31] and be converted that your sins
[1:46:34] may be blotted out and and when
[1:46:38] the times of refreshing shall come
[1:46:42] from the presence of the lord he shall
[1:46:45] send jesus christ which
[1:46:48] before was preached unto you
[1:46:53] look what they're doing they're
[1:46:55] re-gifting
[1:46:56] when they see that somebody didn't have
[1:46:58] something and they knew they had it
[1:47:01] they gifted it you know
[1:47:04] another great a great place in the
[1:47:07] scriptures
[1:47:09] is in the fourth chapter so
[1:47:12] what happens is they start preaching
[1:47:14] this
[1:47:16] and and the scribes and the pharisees
[1:47:21] they get all upset so they go grab them
[1:47:26] and they throw them in jail right and so
[1:47:31] they're they they're locked up in in
[1:47:34] jail and you we know the story uh
[1:47:38] that uh what's going to take place and
[1:47:42] so over here in the
[1:47:43] 13th first after they explained these
[1:47:46] great things
[1:47:47] they said and now when they saw
[1:47:51] the boldness of peter and john
[1:47:54] and perceived that they were unlearned
[1:47:57] and ignorant men
[1:47:59] they marveled that they took
[1:48:02] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:48:06] with jesus
[1:48:10] i'm telling you it's everything
[1:48:13] to have been with jesus
[1:48:17] just be with him
[1:48:20] invite him you've got to invite him
[1:48:25] into your life okay it doesn't matter
[1:48:28] that you know about him
[1:48:31] everybody knows about him because he's
[1:48:33] standing at the door
[1:48:34] and knocking but if you open the door
[1:48:38] and invite him in he will come in and
[1:48:42] sup with you another kill starts
[1:48:45] bestowing upon you
[1:48:47] gifts he'll start giving you what you
[1:48:50] have lack of
[1:48:51] and what you have need of for the father
[1:48:53] knoweth what you have need of
[1:48:55] even before you ask
[1:49:00] okay just being in this presence and
[1:49:03] they marveled that they had
[1:49:05] been with jesus
[1:49:08] because being with jesus they got
[1:49:12] something
[1:49:15] and then they go down here
[1:49:19] and they tell them okay
[1:49:23] it's a notable miracle so
[1:49:26] we just ask you guys that you just go
[1:49:28] out of here
[1:49:30] and with much threatening they
[1:49:33] threatened them
[1:49:36] but i'll tell you something these guys
[1:49:38] were re-gifters
[1:49:42] they were determined to give to others
[1:49:46] what they had received
[1:49:49] because the gift had the heart
[1:49:55] of the giver
[1:49:59] it wasn't a carnal gift it was a gift of
[1:50:02] life
[1:50:04] so they had the spirit of the gift
[1:50:09] that's what the gift of god is it's the
[1:50:11] gift of life
[1:50:13] it's the gift of himself the one that
[1:50:15] sat on the throne the one with majesty
[1:50:17] the one that was called brethren
[1:50:19] the one that all things were subject to
[1:50:21] him that's the gift they had
[1:50:23] that's what they were given they're not
[1:50:25] given theology
[1:50:27] they're not given doctrines they're not
[1:50:29] given bible teachings
[1:50:30] they're giving a person
[1:50:35] they're given something they've got
[1:50:38] something they experienced something
[1:50:41] they know is real
[1:50:45] and so they they say to them and peter
[1:50:47] says in the 19th verse
[1:50:49] and peter and john answered and said to
[1:50:52] them
[1:50:53] whether it be right in the sight of god
[1:50:59] to hearken unto you
[1:51:02] more than unto god ye
[1:51:05] judge
[1:51:09] what would you do if you had the gift
[1:51:12] that i had
[1:51:16] what would you do to you judge
[1:51:20] would you re-gift this if you knew that
[1:51:24] you had
[1:51:25] what this crippled man had need of
[1:51:30] and you knew the gift that you had
[1:51:34] the gift that you possessed that if you
[1:51:37] regifted that to that man he would walk
[1:51:44] but i wonder if more people aren't
[1:51:46] concerned
[1:51:49] what people what peter said here then
[1:51:52] peter said unto him
[1:51:53] whether it be right in the sight of god
[1:51:55] to hearken unto you
[1:51:57] come on our people hearken more into the
[1:51:59] opinion of the world
[1:52:01] hearken more unto this hearken more unto
[1:52:03] that
[1:52:04] are embarrassed because they can't put
[1:52:06] everything together
[1:52:07] i'll tell you never embarrassed paul
[1:52:10] said i am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:52:12] jesus christ
[1:52:13] for it's the power of god unto salvation
[1:52:20] how can you yes sir
[1:52:24] watch pbs that are ready to go over a
[1:52:28] cliff
[1:52:30] can't just let them go over a cliff how
[1:52:32] could you
[1:52:34] see someone that's sick and dying
[1:52:39] and not tell them there's a fountain of
[1:52:40] hope
[1:52:42] in life
[1:52:46] the evidence of not having the gift
[1:52:50] is not having anything to re-gift
[1:52:58] but if you've got it that's right
[1:53:01] the very fact that you possess the gift
[1:53:05] the gift itself is calling to be
[1:53:08] regifted
[1:53:10] it's crying re-gift me re-gift me
[1:53:14] re-gift me give me to others go into all
[1:53:17] the world and preach the gospel
[1:53:19] share me share me with others re-gift me
[1:53:23] these were the first three gifters
[1:53:28] they were re-gifters
[1:53:31] okay it's it it's beautiful
[1:53:34] in this scriptures and
[1:53:38] in another place they were they were
[1:53:40] thrown in prison
[1:53:42] in the fifth chapter and
[1:53:45] and they laid hands upon the apostles
[1:53:48] and put them in the common prison
[1:53:51] so these guys are out get re-gifting
[1:53:54] and every time they re-gift they get
[1:53:56] thrown in the clink
[1:54:00] does that stop them no
[1:54:03] because here's what drives them
[1:54:08] they know they have something
[1:54:11] that they don't have
[1:54:15] they know they don't have the hope of
[1:54:17] healing
[1:54:18] they know they don't have the hope of
[1:54:20] deliverance they know they don't have
[1:54:23] they they they don't even know about it
[1:54:28] they don't know they're they're empty
[1:54:34] it can the gift
[1:54:37] that they have this gift of the spirit
[1:54:43] the is to let the love of god
[1:54:46] be shed abroad by the holy ghost
[1:54:50] look the very thing that they have in
[1:54:52] them is
[1:54:54] crying out to be spread
[1:54:58] to be regifted because the gift that
[1:55:02] they have is the mind of christ
[1:55:04] it's the personality of christ it's the
[1:55:07] personality of god
[1:55:09] what the holy spirit is is the person of
[1:55:12] jesus christ
[1:55:13] in spirit form dwelling in you
[1:55:16] that's the gift of god jesus christ
[1:55:24] just like when jesus was going in that
[1:55:26] funeral possession passed them
[1:55:30] and then he looked and there was that
[1:55:31] mother
[1:55:33] and i'm sure with this great gift of
[1:55:34] discernment he knew where she was from
[1:55:36] and
[1:55:37] knew what her address was can knew what
[1:55:39] her time was
[1:55:40] unless you think that was the devil if
[1:55:42] kenny so knew all these things about her
[1:55:44] and
[1:55:45] she understood that's her only boy
[1:55:47] that's her livelihood
[1:55:49] but death crossed life
[1:55:56] and he looked and he said oh stop
[1:56:01] and rose that child up mother
[1:56:04] receive your son
[1:56:08] that's the nature they had in him
[1:56:12] we got too much religious nature
[1:56:16] we've got politicians instead of
[1:56:18] christians
[1:56:23] we got people who know the book but
[1:56:26] don't know the author
[1:56:31] i like what he told joshua be not
[1:56:35] dismayed
[1:56:36] don't be afraid i am the lord thy god
[1:56:39] and i'm with you
[1:56:40] wherever you go why do things dismantle
[1:56:44] but they were driven by the principle
[1:56:47] that they
[1:56:48] knew they had received a gift that they
[1:56:51] had received
[1:56:52] something different from what other
[1:56:54] people had
[1:56:56] and that's what they wanted to give so
[1:56:58] they were out re-gifting and they got
[1:57:00] thrown in prison
[1:57:02] and again they threw them in the common
[1:57:04] prison and and then
[1:57:06] we all know and they that went on and
[1:57:09] and they put all the guards there
[1:57:11] and all of a sudden it comes down here
[1:57:15] at in the 21st verse saying
[1:57:19] and the prison truly found we shot
[1:57:23] with all safeties and the keepers
[1:57:27] standing without before the doors
[1:57:30] but when we had opened it we found
[1:57:33] no man within
[1:57:36] see these guys were re-gifters
[1:57:41] they're the first three gifters they're
[1:57:44] the first one that received the gift of
[1:57:46] his son
[1:57:48] and now they're they're giving it out
[1:57:51] they put them in prison and they lock
[1:57:54] them up
[1:57:56] but god knows they're re-gifters he
[1:57:59] sends an
[1:58:00] angel and unlocks the prison
[1:58:04] and they're going out and they're over
[1:58:07] at a house someplace
[1:58:08] having a revival planning on the next
[1:58:11] person they're going to re-gift this to
[1:58:17] and so i love this
[1:58:20] and we found no man within
[1:58:23] now when the high priest and the captain
[1:58:26] of the temple
[1:58:28] and the trees chief priest
[1:58:31] heard these things they doubted of them
[1:58:35] whether unto this would grow and then
[1:58:38] all listen to this
[1:58:39] and then come one and told them saying
[1:58:42] behold the men whom ye put in prison
[1:58:46] are standing in the temple regifting
[1:58:50] to all the people
[1:58:54] amen
[1:58:57] amen that's where we are
[1:59:01] re-gifters they were the first three
[1:59:05] gifters
[1:59:08] just think of it they were they
[1:59:11] they were the first re-gifters so
[1:59:14] if you have him you have all that he
[1:59:18] is
[1:59:22] if you've got theology
[1:59:26] then you you can argue that
[1:59:32] but when you possess eternal life
[1:59:36] now i want you to think of that the gift
[1:59:39] of god was what
[1:59:41] eternal life not of yourselves
[1:59:44] unless you can boast he gave it to you
[1:59:48] i want to announce to you this morning
[1:59:51] i will not die
[1:59:59] if this mortal corrupted ugly
[2:00:03] body of flesh departs from me
[2:00:07] i have a body waiting for me
[2:00:13] because that was gifted to me i go to
[2:00:16] prepare for you a place
[2:00:18] i go to prepare for you a body that will
[2:00:20] not perish
[2:00:21] and that you can be where i'm gonna be
[2:00:24] that when this flesh drops off
[2:00:26] this close of fast falls away and
[2:00:28] dissolved
[2:00:29] i have a body waiting for me that's been
[2:00:33] gifted to me
[2:00:37] i didn't earn it
[2:00:41] don't blame me that he gave me
[2:00:46] i think he gave me the gift of salvation
[2:00:50] so people could say if he could save him
[2:00:53] he could save anybody
[2:00:59] if he could raise him from the dead he
[2:01:01] could raise anybody from the dead
[2:01:06] so if you have him
[2:01:09] you have all that he is you see
[2:01:15] you gift healing to the sick
[2:01:23] sure you do because you're the one that
[2:01:26] tells them
[2:01:28] the gift exists you're the one that
[2:01:31] testifies to the gift
[2:01:33] you're the one that brings the faith
[2:01:36] because it's revealed from faith to
[2:01:38] faith
[2:01:40] you possessed all that he is all that
[2:01:42] god was
[2:01:44] he poured into christ
[2:01:47] the works that i do shall you do also
[2:01:52] because i go unto the father i will not
[2:01:55] leave you comfortless
[2:01:56] but i'll come again i'll be with you
[2:01:58] even in you till the end
[2:02:00] and i'll get the spirit of truth will
[2:02:03] lead you
[2:02:04] and guide you into all truth and
[2:02:06] righteousness
[2:02:07] you understand how can you be righteous
[2:02:11] and see a hungry child
[2:02:14] and you have a loaf of bread or you see
[2:02:18] someone in despair and you don't go the
[2:02:20] extra mile with them
[2:02:22] or someone without a coat and you don't
[2:02:24] give them your cloak also
[2:02:28] see that's the real evidence of
[2:02:32] reception of the gift you're so
[2:02:35] convinced that you're concerned
[2:02:38] so you're the possessor
[2:02:42] of the healing you give the healing
[2:02:46] you see someone that has no hope
[2:02:50] no hope
[2:02:54] how you just you just got to go tell
[2:02:56] them hey
[2:02:58] i know the healer
[2:03:02] i know the healer
[2:03:06] i don't care if you don't think i know
[2:03:07] him i know i know him
[2:03:11] i've been healed i've watched him healed
[2:03:16] i've watched babies come live in the
[2:03:19] womb and
[2:03:21] turn into position
[2:03:25] i watch cancers go off of people i can
[2:03:28] testify
[2:03:29] but they're not my testimonies they're
[2:03:31] not my aunts testimonies they're not my
[2:03:34] uncle's testimonies
[2:03:35] they're the testimonies of jesus christ
[2:03:38] the king of kings and the glory who gave
[2:03:41] that
[2:03:42] gift to us that we could regift it
[2:03:46] we're regifting him amen
[2:03:51] and there he is you possess
[2:03:54] the gift of deliverance anybody in here
[2:03:58] been delivered
[2:04:02] oh my god isn't that what paul said
[2:04:05] that he just wrote we we heard it of him
[2:04:08] and also them that witnessed it
[2:04:12] you know god's a deliverer so when you
[2:04:15] see somebody that's in need of
[2:04:18] deliverance
[2:04:21] you have that gift in you
[2:04:24] if you have him what we need to do
[2:04:28] is become re-gifters
[2:04:32] we need to start giving what we've got
[2:04:41] well i i guarantee you i think me and my
[2:04:44] wife could go into our closet and we've
[2:04:45] got enough clothes to
[2:04:47] to dress half
[2:04:51] dallas fort worth
[2:04:54] you know we just end up possessing too
[2:04:56] much
[2:04:57] cannot giving enough away
[2:05:02] we've got all this great gift that we've
[2:05:04] got
[2:05:06] that we claim we have the lord of glory
[2:05:10] eternal life how could you see
[2:05:14] someone that doesn't have eternal life
[2:05:17] and not want to give them what you have
[2:05:25] you've got the gift it's something
[2:05:29] you have to give
[2:05:35] it's something you have to give
[2:05:40] because it's been given to you
[2:05:45] and so my christmas
[2:05:49] message is let's become re-gifters
[2:05:55] let's go out and re-give everything
[2:05:58] we've got from him
[2:06:03] let's be like the loaves and the fishes
[2:06:07] the more we break and the more we give
[2:06:09] the more it grows
[2:06:12] let's let our cups overflow
[2:06:18] don't be ashamed
[2:06:21] that somebody what difference does it
[2:06:23] make if he's the mayor
[2:06:26] and he lacks what you've got
[2:06:32] just say mr mayor could i talk to you in
[2:06:34] private sir
[2:06:36] it would be all right i don't care if
[2:06:38] your security guard overhears
[2:06:40] but mr mayor i'd humbly like to share
[2:06:42] with you
[2:06:43] you're hellbound
[2:06:47] and you're going to burn in hell if you
[2:06:50] don't accept
[2:06:51] jesus christ the gift of life
[2:06:55] now do you have that life in you
[2:07:00] enough that you could express that love
[2:07:04] i just gave a harsh example so that you
[2:07:07] could understand
[2:07:10] but when someone you see the need can
[2:07:12] you take them by the hands
[2:07:14] can kneel down with them and say let's
[2:07:17] pray through
[2:07:21] if we were going to go through the room
[2:07:22] this morning and i was to say how many
[2:07:24] people have you knelt down with and
[2:07:26] prayed
[2:07:26] how many of your friends have you sat
[2:07:28] down with the bible and told them about
[2:07:30] the life you have
[2:07:31] how many people have you shared them
[2:07:33] with can we went right down the line
[2:07:37] i wonder when it comes up that it
[2:07:40] really the final conclusion was
[2:07:43] that we haven't opened our gift
[2:07:48] we've got it but we haven't opened it
[2:07:53] we haven't seen all that it can do so i
[2:07:56] say this morning let's open our gift
[2:08:00] let's look at all that he can do
[2:08:03] all the needs that we have in our bible
[2:08:06] let's just
[2:08:07] re-gift what we've got
[2:08:10] one to another let us re-gift
[2:08:14] let's join the re-gifters
[2:08:17] because if our faith in this last day
[2:08:21] is to be restored if we we have to come
[2:08:24] back
[2:08:25] to to the faith that came at the day of
[2:08:29] pentecost
[2:08:31] that all the palmer worm and all the
[2:08:33] cankerworm and all the caterpillar
[2:08:35] locusts have eaten
[2:08:36] if that promise can this day that that
[2:08:39] gift
[2:08:41] could be restored back to us
[2:08:45] then that would have to mean that if the
[2:08:47] faith of the fathers what the
[2:08:49] pentecostals fathers have
[2:08:51] if that revival was to take place in us
[2:08:54] and they were re-gifters
[2:08:56] then that would make us regifters
[2:08:59] that's right so let's go emptying our
[2:09:03] spiritual gift
[2:09:04] closet out let's go share them
[2:09:07] let's tell people when you see somebody
[2:09:10] lacking
[2:09:11] what you have
[2:09:14] regift it do you see someone that lacks
[2:09:18] joy
[2:09:19] re-gift your joy you see someone that
[2:09:22] lacks peace
[2:09:23] re-gift that peace
[2:09:26] tell them the peace if you've got
[2:09:30] somebody that you know is in need of
[2:09:32] healing
[2:09:33] gift the healing by his stripes we are
[2:09:37] healed
[2:09:39] go to that person re-gift it to him
[2:09:42] tell them about it be a re-gifter
[2:09:47] and i could go on and on but i hope that
[2:09:49] you understand today
[2:09:50] we've got such a great gift in christ
[2:09:53] jesus
[2:09:54] by the grace of god
[2:09:59] let's re-gift it
[2:10:02] and i believe in re-gifting
[2:10:06] so i'd like to close the service
