[33:02] the statue of a perfect man
[33:06] father do find our place
[33:10] and our position in your kingdom
[33:14] and father we surrender you to to you
[33:17] this morning
[33:18] to allow you to
[33:21] make the changes in our life that
[33:25] would please you father we just asked
[33:29] this morning
[33:30] that your word would
[33:34] bless us and increase our understanding
[33:37] and help
[33:38] us but we don't have the ability to
[33:45] even begin to express
[33:49] all that you have prepared for your
[33:52] children
[33:54] lord we trust that you will deal with
[33:56] each heart
[33:57] individually this morning and personally
[34:01] and we just ask that you would
[34:04] bless it to us today in jesus precious
[34:07] and
[34:08] holy name we pray amen
[34:11] amen god bless you this morning it's
[34:13] nice to be in the house of lord thank
[34:15] you musicians
[34:16] nice to have billy back and
[34:20] sister laurie back and
[34:24] there's you know there's some that have
[34:26] been out for a while now but
[34:30] we want to remember them in prayer and
[34:32] keep them
[34:33] in mind the green leaves and the
[34:35] alexanders
[34:36] and and bruce and ronda and
[34:40] and others have have been out and
[34:43] so we just trust that the lord would
[34:46] certainly be their portion i certainly
[34:48] miss them all
[34:50] um but we understand the kind of
[34:52] conditions that
[34:54] we're in uh kind of uncertainties and
[34:58] different things but the lord sure has
[35:00] been
[35:01] merciful and gracious to us and we've
[35:04] kind of battled through it
[35:06] you know some we have different ones
[35:08] that have come but it seems like
[35:10] it looks like everybody's already been
[35:12] infected and we've all
[35:14] we're all immune now i don't know but
[35:17] we trust the lord amen so let's read in
[35:21] our scriptures
[35:22] found in
[35:28] luke the gospel of saint luke
[35:31] and we want to read
[35:38] in this 16th
[35:41] in the 14th chapter i believe
[35:45] starting at the 16th verse
[35:50] and i'm going to
[35:53] read it from
[35:57] out of the message that we'll listen to
[35:59] a little bit
[36:00] this morning too and
[36:04] because he makes a comment in there so
[36:08] as i read it i'm going to read it out of
[36:11] the message because
[36:12] and so i can add the comment that
[36:14] brother branham makes
[36:16] and he says then said
[36:20] he unto a certain man
[36:25] then said he un unto him
[36:28] a certain man made a great
[36:31] supper and made many
[36:35] and sent his servants at supper time
[36:38] to say to them that were bidden
[36:42] come for all things are now
[36:46] ready and they all
[36:49] with one accord begin
[36:52] to make excuses
[36:56] the first said unto him i
[36:59] bought a piece of ground and i must need
[37:03] go and see it i pray thee have me
[37:07] excused and another
[37:10] said i have bought five yoke of ox
[37:14] and i go to prove them
[37:17] i pray thee have me excused
[37:22] and another said i have married a wife
[37:26] therefore i cannot come
[37:29] so the servant came and showed his lord
[37:34] all these things then the master
[37:37] of the house being angry said
[37:41] to his servant notice
[37:44] it's not servants servant
[37:49] go out quickly into the streets
[37:54] and the lame and
[37:57] the lane and the cities
[38:00] and bring in hither the poor
[38:04] and the maim and the halt
[38:08] and the blind and the servant
[38:11] said lord it is done
[38:14] as thou hath commanded and yet
[38:18] there is room and the lord said unto his
[38:22] servant
[38:23] go out into the highways and the hedges
[38:27] and compel them to come in
[38:31] that my house may be filled
[38:35] for i say unto you that none of those
[38:38] men
[38:38] which were bidden shall taste
[38:42] of my supper lord bless his word lord
[38:46] bless you may be seated this morning
[39:00] we want to understand this morning that
[39:03] um we're really not here this morning
[39:06] for
[39:07] an evangelistic uh service
[39:10] uh as much as we are here
[39:14] to grow in god's word
[39:18] and to be taught uh
[39:21] the things of the lord and there's some
[39:26] certain things that are on my heart that
[39:29] i believe that the believer
[39:33] has to be founded in and
[39:36] understand so they're not easily
[39:39] shaken and
[39:42] and you know i could probably uh
[39:45] express these things to you but
[39:49] you know the reason i i like to
[39:53] play and show you these things
[39:57] that brother branham said is so that you
[40:00] can
[40:01] have that personal connection with
[40:04] it because he's the servant that was
[40:07] sent to go into the highways
[40:10] and the byways and to compel them
[40:14] to come in so
[40:17] but so that part of the word of god
[40:21] is a revelation that we have that god
[40:24] sent an angel in this day
[40:28] and he vindicated him by a pillar of
[40:31] fire
[40:32] and by signs and wonders
[40:35] and and we notice that
[40:39] uh and we'll play this now out of this
[40:42] message
[40:43] is your life uh worthy of the gospel
[40:47] and then we're going to play another
[40:48] little section after this
[40:51] but as we listen to this
[40:54] um it's it's going to emphasize
[40:59] on the rejection
[41:03] and the excuse and
[41:06] one of the things that i want to really
[41:09] have us
[41:10] be established in our heart
[41:13] this morning is that
[41:16] this is what that
[41:20] we are talking about and
[41:23] what it is that we believe
[41:27] this is uh this is
[41:30] fresh manna this is a
[41:34] gospel of fresh manna
[41:37] and it's fresh manna today
[41:40] and the reason it's fresh manna today
[41:43] is that it was stored up just like in
[41:47] the garners of egypt
[41:49] when there shall be a famine they stored
[41:52] up the word
[41:54] and the gospel tells us that in this age
[41:57] it's not a famine for meat and food but
[42:00] it's a famine
[42:02] for the pure word of god
[42:05] okay so in order to really receive
[42:09] the the pure word of god that word was
[42:13] stored
[42:13] up for us okay and in the fact that it
[42:17] was being stored up
[42:19] it allows us to go to
[42:22] the storehouse and receive
[42:26] fresh manna now
[42:30] it's been the the
[42:33] nature of man to
[42:37] not want to move forward they get
[42:40] comfortable
[42:41] they get set they want to build
[42:45] for themselves what they believe
[42:49] so they set up walls they build creeds
[42:52] they build
[42:53] dogmas they they say this is what we
[42:56] believe
[42:56] this is what we teach they put a period
[42:59] to
[43:00] all things and then they build a camp
[43:04] and they dwell in that camp
[43:07] and as long as they're in that camp
[43:10] they're comfortable
[43:12] and then they begin to pat one another
[43:14] on the back and say
[43:15] comparing themselves one with another
[43:18] you're okay i'm okay
[43:21] but what our hearts desire has been
[43:24] and what the brothers have ministered on
[43:27] all the brethren that is preached i was
[43:29] really enjoyed brother randy
[43:32] wednesday night and the minister of
[43:35] brothers that have come
[43:36] in our visiting ministers and and
[43:39] the things that it's god's speaking
[43:42] about
[43:43] it just seems like there's a calling to
[43:47] us
[43:48] to come into a place where
[43:51] we're about the father's business
[43:54] and there's a real clear cut line
[43:58] between the things that belong to god
[44:01] and the things that are of the world
[44:04] and we understand that the reason that
[44:07] this messenger was sent was
[44:10] also to fulfill malachi 4
[44:14] 5. and that was to return the hearts of
[44:18] the children
[44:19] back to their fathers another is the
[44:23] restoration
[44:24] of the faith or
[44:27] the a restoration in
[44:31] the revelation of a
[44:34] living christ a living lord and savior
[44:38] a living jesus that does
[44:42] the same things that he always done
[44:45] he's the same yesterday today
[44:48] and forever and a return
[44:51] to that faith and that
[44:56] revelation and so he sent this
[44:59] vindicated message and
[45:02] to bring us to catch the ears of the
[45:05] believer
[45:06] so in this section that we're going to
[45:09] listen to
[45:10] is i i really want you to tune in
[45:14] if you could when he begins to explain
[45:17] what the mark of the beast is
[45:21] because there's and and i say this
[45:24] because
[45:26] there's going to be all kinds of
[45:28] teachings and all kinds of ideas out
[45:31] there
[45:32] and we realize as we get closer to the
[45:36] end
[45:37] end time questions begin to arise
[45:41] you know isn't there supposed to be a
[45:43] mark of the beast what is the mark of
[45:45] the beast
[45:46] i i've heard that it's they're putting
[45:48] chips in your ear and
[45:50] don't get vaccinated because there's a
[45:53] microchip
[45:55] in there you know and they're they're
[45:57] following you
[45:58] everywhere and yeah and you get all
[46:01] these
[46:02] ideas of what it is and
[46:05] don't use a credit card or that little
[46:07] chip on your
[46:08] credit card they they they're keeping
[46:11] track of everything you buy
[46:13] and all your and it and that you
[46:16] we totally miss it
[46:21] okay and so he's talking about a
[46:25] feast that's offered
[46:28] in other words fresh manna isn't that
[46:32] the lady of
[46:33] age behold i stand at the door and knock
[46:36] if any man come
[46:37] into me can and let me in i will come in
[46:41] and i will sup
[46:42] with him in other words i will feed him
[46:45] the evening meal
[46:47] i will sup with them i'll provide them
[46:49] fresh food
[46:50] it's not a one-time thing i i hate i
[46:54] don't have a vocabulary to express it
[46:57] so forgive me but the message isn't a
[47:00] one-time
[47:01] complete thing it's eternal
[47:04] word of god brother abraham didn't
[47:08] make anything up
[47:11] it was always in the eternal word of god
[47:15] he's actually expressing what god had in
[47:19] mind
[47:20] in the beginning because he was made a
[47:23] messenger
[47:24] and made a prophet and a prophet
[47:27] is one that god makes that he can
[47:30] speak lip to ear to
[47:34] that he that he's he's made to be able
[47:37] to deal with
[47:38] god i would have to say that if i
[47:41] came in to the presence of god
[47:45] above the anointing i'm afraid i would
[47:48] wither
[47:49] and shake with fear
[47:52] to uh the awesomeness
[47:56] of the power of god and even to be able
[47:59] to take it physically
[48:02] but he's made that certain way to come
[48:05] in contact
[48:06] with and enter into the presence of god
[48:10] and god speak to him
[48:12] and then him stay all the prophets
[48:16] stayed exactly with what
[48:20] was revealed to them that's why he said
[48:23] isaiah when he prophesied a virgin
[48:25] shall conceive he said a virgin shall
[48:29] conceive
[48:30] and that's madness
[48:36] but yet it's what god had in his
[48:39] thinking
[48:40] so i believe that god had something in
[48:44] his
[48:44] thinking for each of you
[48:48] in this age that he predestined in 88 to
[48:52] jute to be in
[48:54] and that the the person
[48:57] the servant is who goes out and compels
[49:03] to you to come to that place
[49:07] so in in sharing this with you
[49:10] and listening this together we can all
[49:14] understand what the servant is
[49:17] compelling us to come to in other words
[49:21] what feast is it
[49:24] that the messenger wants us to come to
[49:28] if it's the feast of fresh manna
[49:34] a feast of fresh manna not an old
[49:38] historical story
[49:42] you understand i don't want a historical
[49:45] story of jesus
[49:49] i don't want a historical story of the
[49:52] church
[49:54] i don't want the doctrines of these
[49:57] things
[49:58] but i want to go into a higher place
[50:03] i want to be fed and
[50:06] be enlightened and have greater
[50:10] revelation
[50:12] i want to be fed fresh manna
[50:15] for today and
[50:19] you still can't escape
[50:22] the fact that it was the servant
[50:27] that came and compelled us
[50:30] to come into the feast
[50:35] you understand so if you do away with
[50:37] the servant
[50:39] you do away with the one that's got the
[50:41] power
[50:43] to compel you
[50:48] it am i making any sense this morning
[50:51] so you you have to make that connection
[50:55] and that understanding with the message
[50:57] of this hour
[50:58] that that's the servant that's going to
[51:02] cause the compel the compelling
[51:05] power within you to move into higher
[51:08] ground
[51:10] though he did send his servants
[51:14] out and they told everybody
[51:17] that there's a feast
[51:21] and that's what we do we go out can say
[51:24] there's manna and mannak and there's
[51:26] a feast and there's food prepared for
[51:29] you
[51:30] but when that person comes it's that
[51:33] servant that went out
[51:36] and compels the heart to come in so in
[51:39] saying those things
[51:41] let us look because when they went out
[51:44] everybody came up with an excuse
[51:48] so we need a self-examination
[51:52] that we are that we haven't built
[51:54] excuses
[51:57] you know we could put school in here we
[52:00] could put
[52:00] job in there you know we could have all
[52:04] these little different things
[52:06] but what was the excuse
[52:10] the excuses kept them from eating
[52:14] fresh man so it's very simple to say i
[52:18] believe the message
[52:21] i believe god sent a prophet excuse me
[52:24] and
[52:25] i believe everything that's there
[52:30] but there's still fresh feasting mana
[52:33] that's there for you personally so let's
[52:36] listen to this
[52:37] this is uh 18 minutes
[52:42] and it's a real good 18 minutes and i
[52:45] and like i said i'm not here to
[52:47] evangelize this morning
[52:49] i you know i'm i'm i'm
[52:52] not an evangelist i'm you know i guess
[52:55] god called me to be a pastor and
[52:57] it's what i am i didn't want to be but i
[53:00] didn't have a choice
[53:03] and that he sort of made it happen
[53:07] and always wanted to be an apostle
[53:12] you know go missionary well
[53:15] praise god there's a lot of missionary
[53:16] work to do right here in the united
[53:18] states
[53:19] but so uh for those of you
[53:23] i i hope that they've got the
[53:24] interpreters
[53:26] have got the information and we're
[53:29] trying to get a system
[53:30] in place where uh i don't know i'm not
[53:33] technical so i don't know but they can
[53:35] have the message pulled up uh if you can
[53:39] pull it up on your phone
[53:41] in your language we're starting in
[53:44] is your life worthy of the gospel
[53:48] it's 30 minutes into the tape
[53:51] and it's paragraph 42 and we'll listen
[53:54] for 18 minutes
[53:58] here and i think we
[54:02] end up i don't know
[54:06] we end up at the end of paragraph 76
[54:11] and so i trust that
[54:15] we will sit here this morning in a bible
[54:21] atmosphere this morning and a sunday
[54:23] school atmosphere
[54:25] we'll learn of the word of god we can
[54:27] answer
[54:28] some of the questions that are out there
[54:32] and i just want to cover a few things
[54:34] this morning
[54:35] that i think will be beneficial to us so
[54:39] lord bless you this morning
[54:43] so as we begin to play
[54:46] out of is your life worthy of the gospel
[54:49] and just listen close this morning and
[54:53] we'll try to just do the best we can
[54:57] to share with you what's on our heart
[54:59] this morning
[55:00] god bless you
[55:04] jesus tell him that their excuses is
[55:06] what killed the prophets
[55:08] and what killed the righteous that come
[55:13] they accepted their creeds that man had
[55:16] given them
[55:16] instead of taking the word of god and by
[55:20] doing so had made the word of god of no
[55:22] effect
[55:23] now you've either got to say in this
[55:25] that this
[55:26] is god's will and god's desire or
[55:29] either something else that you can crop
[55:31] up that's better than what this
[55:33] is now you have to take one or the other
[55:36] you can't serve god and man and you've
[55:39] got to say this
[55:40] is the truth or that's part of the truth
[55:44] or it isn't all the truth or it isn't
[55:46] put together right
[55:47] or it's isn't interpreted right and the
[55:49] bible said
[55:50] that the word of god is no private
[55:53] interpretation
[55:54] no one else is supposed to put an
[55:56] interpretation to it it's written
[55:57] just the way god wants it interpreted
[56:00] just what it says that that's what's
[56:02] supposed to be
[56:03] just take it the way it said which wrote
[56:06] down here
[56:08] now they accept their creeds they make
[56:10] gods
[56:11] a promises of no effect to them they
[56:14] bypass that
[56:15] just skip away from it now if russia
[56:19] had accepted the pentecostal blessing
[56:22] 75 years ago when the holy ghost fell in
[56:25] russia
[56:26] they wouldn't have been communist today
[56:30] now 75 years ago they had a great
[56:32] revival
[56:33] in russia god come among them and they
[56:37] had
[56:37] great revivals way into siberia
[56:40] and what did they do they rejected it
[56:44] and today the country is gone and the
[56:47] churches
[56:48] can't have church uh only honor
[56:51] permission
[56:52] and they are doomed into judgment
[56:55] has gone off on this wild tantrum
[56:58] of communism sold out to the devil
[57:03] 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in
[57:06] england
[57:09] just after that come george jeffries and
[57:13] f.f bosworth and charles price
[57:18] smith wigglesworth those great warriors
[57:21] of the faith
[57:22] 50 years ago and offered england
[57:26] the holy ghost revival but what did they
[57:30] do
[57:30] they laughed at them put them in jail
[57:34] called them crazy thought they lost
[57:37] their minds
[57:38] the churches refused the people to come
[57:40] hear them and they healed the sick and
[57:42] cast out
[57:43] devils and done great works and because
[57:47] that
[57:47] england as a nation rejected the gospel
[57:51] her her sins is known throughout all the
[57:54] world
[57:56] there's hardly a a more of an apostate
[58:00] a nation in all the world even including
[58:03] rome and france
[58:04] than england she's a mother of apostasy
[58:09] right where uh finney
[58:13] and many of the great man preached in
[58:16] the hay market and charles g finney
[58:19] and wesley and on down
[58:23] and she turned it down and down
[58:27] even last week or two in the papers you
[58:30] find out where their great man
[58:32] has so weakened to the to this sect
[58:36] of women until spies come into their
[58:39] head man found some more of them
[58:42] the magazines is packed it their sin of
[58:45] scandal right in their government
[58:47] has sold their disgraceful name
[58:50] across the world why
[58:54] she rejected the truth she had her
[58:57] excuse
[58:59] and she's finished england
[59:02] is all washed up with god long time ago
[59:07] if america 15 years ago
[59:12] when the great healing revival
[59:16] continued on from pentecost broke out in
[59:19] the nation
[59:20] and there was a revivals on the capitol
[59:24] washington d.c the presidents
[59:27] vice presidents great people governors
[59:32] great things taking place governors and
[59:34] and
[59:35] man were healed that congressman up shaw
[59:38] had been a for
[59:39] for 66 years and they
[59:42] could not turn their face and say it
[59:44] wasn't so it was
[59:46] right before but they turned it down
[59:50] and tonight that's the reason this
[59:52] nation stays
[59:53] she's doomed there's no hope
[59:57] for it at all she's crossed the line
[1:00:00] between
[1:00:00] judgment and mercy and she's elected in
[1:00:04] what she has here to control the nation
[1:00:07] and she's rotten to the core
[1:00:10] her politics is rotten
[1:00:13] the morals of this nation is lower than
[1:00:16] anything i can think of
[1:00:18] and a religious system is rotten her
[1:00:21] than the morals
[1:00:24] she becomes and doing this she has now
[1:00:28] joined herself all these churches and
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:31] nation into the federation of churches
[1:00:33] and has taken the mark of the beast
[1:00:36] what a thing why
[1:00:40] christ give them the opportunity
[1:00:44] come to my feast the feast of pentecost
[1:00:47] which means
[1:00:48] fifty when the holy spirit poured out on
[1:00:51] russia
[1:00:52] they was called to a feast of pentecost
[1:00:54] spiritual feast
[1:00:56] and they turned it down england
[1:00:59] the holy ghost was poured out upon them
[1:01:01] and they turned it down
[1:01:04] america the holy ghost was poured out
[1:01:06] upon them and they
[1:01:08] turned it down
[1:01:12] he bit three times
[1:01:15] three times he sent out and they did not
[1:01:19] listen to the feast and he sent again
[1:01:22] and he said go and compel those people
[1:01:25] to come
[1:01:27] the table's got to be set the table's
[1:01:30] ready there's still room and i believe
[1:01:33] that maybe
[1:01:34] maybe within the next few months or
[1:01:36] something or a year or whatever it is
[1:01:38] god's going to send another shaking
[1:01:41] across the country
[1:01:42] for the somebody still out there
[1:01:44] somewhere that's
[1:01:46] a predestinated seed that the light has
[1:01:48] to fall on somewhere
[1:01:50] somewhere in the world
[1:01:53] the nation itself is gone i was looking
[1:01:56] in
[1:01:57] this week's life magazine down
[1:02:00] at the world down at little rock or the
[1:02:03] other day or
[1:02:04] rather hot springs and there i seen
[1:02:07] i believe it was a governor of the state
[1:02:10] of new york
[1:02:12] where some kind of a striptease over in
[1:02:14] holland
[1:02:16] dancing with her now and here below that
[1:02:19] was another
[1:02:20] renowned man oh what a disgrace
[1:02:25] look at our nation today look at the
[1:02:27] condition of our
[1:02:28] of our nation look where she's went to
[1:02:32] how low she sunk
[1:02:35] look at our religious system today how
[1:02:39] can it be
[1:02:40] that the churches can ever get into the
[1:02:43] condition that they are now
[1:02:45] is because they have rejected and
[1:02:47] refused a message of god
[1:02:50] the invitation to come to the feast
[1:02:53] could you
[1:02:53] call a life like that worthy of the
[1:02:56] gospel
[1:02:58] could you call a life that could set
[1:03:02] and permit their their people to do the
[1:03:05] things
[1:03:06] to smoke cigarettes the other day down
[1:03:09] here a certain church
[1:03:10] a little league team was playing down
[1:03:13] here at the park
[1:03:15] and uh brother-in-law's little boy
[1:03:18] is a pitcher uh for one of the teams
[1:03:21] and so he was out there pitching and
[1:03:24] there was a church league playing
[1:03:25] and there was a pastor with these little
[1:03:28] fellows
[1:03:29] out there on the ground playing and the
[1:03:31] pastor smoked cigarette after cigarette
[1:03:34] of a real neighborly church right nearby
[1:03:39] and could you imagine a man and even
[1:03:42] people sitting in the audience noticed
[1:03:44] it but it's getting so
[1:03:47] that they don't even pay attention to it
[1:03:49] a certain great church of baptist church
[1:03:52] that i know of lets a church out from
[1:03:54] sunday school
[1:03:56] 15 extra minutes so that the pastor
[1:03:59] and all of them can stand outside and
[1:04:01] smoke before they come back
[1:04:03] in to serve the duty of the law
[1:04:08] john smith the founder of that church
[1:04:10] prayed so hard that god
[1:04:12] sent the revival until his eyes swole
[1:04:14] shut at night
[1:04:15] and his wife had to lead him to the
[1:04:16] table and feed him with a spoon
[1:04:18] if that man would turn over in his grave
[1:04:21] if he know
[1:04:21] that church had gotten that condition
[1:04:24] what is it they were bidding to come and
[1:04:27] turn it down
[1:04:30] that's the only thing and you remember
[1:04:32] jesus
[1:04:33] said in here that those that were bitten
[1:04:36] and turned it down
[1:04:37] would not taste his supper
[1:04:41] when god sends a holy ghost and knocks
[1:04:43] at a man's door
[1:04:45] and he deliberately turns it down for
[1:04:47] some time he's going to turn it for his
[1:04:49] last time
[1:04:51] and then you won't be a privileged
[1:04:53] character
[1:04:54] you can sit in the church and listen to
[1:04:57] the gospel and agree
[1:04:59] with the gospel you might do so much and
[1:05:02] say i know it's right
[1:05:04] but never put a finger on it to help it
[1:05:07] yourself
[1:05:09] see you just listen to it because you
[1:05:11] say i believe it's right
[1:05:12] that's just sympathizing with it
[1:05:16] i could say i believe that's a ten
[1:05:17] thousand dollars that don't mean i got
[1:05:19] it
[1:05:20] thing i could say that's good cold water
[1:05:23] but refuse to drink it
[1:05:26] you know what i mean and this is eternal
[1:05:29] life
[1:05:31] and to refuse to do it one day you'll
[1:05:33] cross the line between
[1:05:35] judgment and mercy and then you won't be
[1:05:39] have the privilege to come and receive
[1:05:41] it
[1:05:42] to you people who come here i'm
[1:05:46] not responsible for those who are or
[1:05:48] other ministers are speaking to
[1:05:50] but if it's right you
[1:05:53] owe your life to it
[1:05:57] what more could you ever find that would
[1:05:59] be
[1:06:00] more of a benefit to you than to know
[1:06:03] that you can have
[1:06:04] eternal life what if i
[1:06:07] was giving away capsules here that
[1:06:11] scientifically proven scientifically
[1:06:14] proven
[1:06:15] that this capsule would make you live a
[1:06:19] thousand years
[1:06:22] well i'd i'd have to get a militia out
[1:06:24] here
[1:06:26] and swarm away from the place you
[1:06:29] wouldn't have to make an altar call
[1:06:31] it you just have to beat him away from
[1:06:33] it
[1:06:35] to live a thousand years and yet
[1:06:38] scientifically proven
[1:06:41] that the eternal god all these power of
[1:06:46] his resurrections which promise you
[1:06:47] eternal life
[1:06:50] and satan will put his legions out there
[1:06:52] and keep you away from it
[1:06:55] yet you can look it's sensible enough
[1:06:57] look in the face of it and see it's
[1:06:58] right but then turn it down
[1:07:01] see something some kind of excuse
[1:07:04] it's too hot i'm too tired i will
[1:07:07] tomorrow
[1:07:08] just some kind of an excuse that's all
[1:07:11] they do by rejecting
[1:07:14] the day of visitation it separates you
[1:07:18] from god now we noticed in the old
[1:07:21] testament
[1:07:22] they had what they call the jubilee year
[1:07:25] that was when all the people that was
[1:07:28] slaves could go free when the jubilee
[1:07:31] sounded
[1:07:32] and then if the man did not go out if
[1:07:35] there was some excuse that he could give
[1:07:37] that he didn't want to return to his
[1:07:39] land then he had to be marked in the ear
[1:07:42] with an
[1:07:42] awl by the post in the temple
[1:07:46] and then no matter how many jubilees
[1:07:48] come along
[1:07:49] that man was sold out he could never
[1:07:53] no more come back as a citizen in israel
[1:07:55] no more
[1:07:57] what did he do he rejected his
[1:07:59] invitation
[1:08:01] he didn't have to pay nothing the debt
[1:08:03] of his slavery was over
[1:08:06] his family was free he could go right
[1:08:09] back to his homeland and get his own
[1:08:11] possession
[1:08:12] but if he refused to do it then he
[1:08:15] wasn't allowed
[1:08:16] no more with israel and his possession
[1:08:17] was given to another
[1:08:19] now the same thing in the natural
[1:08:22] applies to the spiritual
[1:08:25] that if we as inheritance of eternal
[1:08:28] life
[1:08:29] and we hear the gospel and know that
[1:08:32] it's true and we reject it and refuse to
[1:08:34] do it or to listen to it
[1:08:36] we take on the mark of the beast
[1:08:40] now somebody said now there's going to
[1:08:42] be a a mark of the beast
[1:08:44] it's going to come someday let me tell
[1:08:46] you it's already come
[1:08:49] as soon as the holy ghost began to fall
[1:08:52] the mark of the beast began to take
[1:08:53] place
[1:08:54] see you only have two things one of them
[1:08:58] is accepted takes the seal of god
[1:09:01] to reject it takes the mark of the beast
[1:09:04] do you reject
[1:09:05] the seal of god is to take the mark of
[1:09:08] the beast
[1:09:09] everybody understand to reject
[1:09:12] the seal of god is to take the mark of
[1:09:14] the beast for the bible said
[1:09:16] all that was not sealed by the seal of
[1:09:18] god took the mark of the beast
[1:09:21] when the trumpet sounded all wanted to
[1:09:23] go free could go there but it was marked
[1:09:26] now you see the mark of the beast if we
[1:09:31] talk about it in the future is when it's
[1:09:33] going to be made manifest
[1:09:35] when you realize that what you've
[1:09:37] already done
[1:09:39] see and so is the holy spirit
[1:09:42] it's to be manifested when we see the
[1:09:45] lord jesus coming
[1:09:47] in glory and feel that transforming
[1:09:50] power
[1:09:52] and see the dead rising out of the grave
[1:09:54] i know that
[1:09:55] a second longer will be changed and have
[1:09:58] a body like his
[1:10:01] it'll be made manifest then to see those
[1:10:04] who
[1:10:04] rejected it will be left down out
[1:10:08] then jesus said the virgins went out to
[1:10:10] meet christ
[1:10:12] some of them fell asleep the first watch
[1:10:14] second third fourth fifth sixth
[1:10:16] to the seventh watch but in the seventh
[1:10:18] watch
[1:10:19] then came forth the sound behold the
[1:10:22] bridegroom coming
[1:10:23] out the needy and the ones that were
[1:10:26] sleeping
[1:10:27] awakened all the age back to pentecost
[1:10:32] woke up see from the seventh age the
[1:10:35] seventh church age
[1:10:36] all the way back through woke up and
[1:10:38] these that were in this church age of
[1:10:40] living
[1:10:41] they were changed and they went in at
[1:10:43] the very
[1:10:44] time they went in the sleeping version
[1:10:46] come and said we want to buy some of
[1:10:48] your oil
[1:10:49] but they said we just got enough for
[1:10:51] ourselves go to them and sell it and
[1:10:53] while they were
[1:10:54] trying to receive this aura the
[1:10:56] bridegroom came
[1:11:00] there has never been a time in the
[1:11:02] history of the world
[1:11:04] that the episcopalians baptists
[1:11:07] methodists presbyterians the papers are
[1:11:11] full
[1:11:12] the religious papers are praising god
[1:11:15] that those sleeping virgins are now
[1:11:17] trying to receive pentecost trying to
[1:11:21] receive the holy ghost
[1:11:23] and not the people realize that
[1:11:26] it will not happen according to the word
[1:11:29] of god
[1:11:30] while they were trying to come back
[1:11:33] the bridegroom come and talk away the
[1:11:36] bride
[1:11:36] they were cast into outer darkness for
[1:11:39] judgment
[1:11:41] because they rejected their invitation
[1:11:46] all peoples are forbidden to come god in
[1:11:49] every age has sent out his life
[1:11:51] and it's been rejected and now today is
[1:11:55] no
[1:11:55] different from any other date to reject
[1:11:58] the day
[1:11:58] of the visitation when god is making a
[1:12:02] visit to the church and to the people
[1:12:04] receive it then don't put it off the
[1:12:07] next year
[1:12:08] the next revival that's the hour today
[1:12:10] is a day of salvation
[1:12:12] and remember god has never sent a
[1:12:15] message in
[1:12:16] any day but what he vindicated with the
[1:12:18] supernatural
[1:12:21] jesus said himself if i do not the works
[1:12:24] of my father then believe me not
[1:12:27] but if i do the works you believe that
[1:12:29] works if you can't believe me
[1:12:31] when you see it clearly cut and made
[1:12:35] manifest
[1:12:36] now the time has come that she rejects
[1:12:39] it then she's bored in the ear
[1:12:41] with an awl then she'll never hear it
[1:12:43] now she takes herself to the
[1:12:44] confederation of churches to go right in
[1:12:47] to take the mark of the beast
[1:12:48] one of the great ambitions somebody gave
[1:12:50] me the paper and just now the this new
[1:12:52] pope has said
[1:12:53] is to unite the churches together
[1:12:56] they'll do it just as certain as i'm
[1:12:58] standing here and the protestants fall
[1:13:00] apart
[1:13:03] see because the church the bible said
[1:13:06] paul
[1:13:06] the prophet of the lord said that day
[1:13:09] will not come
[1:13:10] except there come a falling away first
[1:13:14] and then the man before the man of sin
[1:13:16] will be revealed
[1:13:18] he that set up in the temple of god
[1:13:20] opposing himself all that's above god
[1:13:22] he as god forgiving sins on the earth
[1:13:26] and so forth
[1:13:28] how that this thing happened but it
[1:13:31] couldn't happen
[1:13:32] until the falling away until the church
[1:13:34] began to get away from
[1:13:35] the spiritual feasts draw itself back
[1:13:38] and organize itself
[1:13:40] and then the revelation didn't stay with
[1:13:43] the church
[1:13:44] remember israel walked day
[1:13:47] and night by the pillar of fire
[1:13:51] when that pillar fire moved they moved
[1:13:53] with it
[1:13:54] and remember it was a fire at night and
[1:13:57] a cloud a day
[1:13:59] so it might come day or night any time
[1:14:02] but wherever it was there was a
[1:14:04] propitiation made
[1:14:05] that they would not fail to see it it
[1:14:08] was a light at night
[1:14:09] and a cloud in the daytime and they
[1:14:11] followed it
[1:14:12] yes sir that same thing martin luther
[1:14:15] saw it
[1:14:16] what did he do he come out of
[1:14:17] catholicism well what did they do
[1:14:19] they built a little fence around said
[1:14:21] we're lutherans this is it
[1:14:23] then wesley saw it moving away from
[1:14:24] there he went what they do build a
[1:14:26] little fence around and said this is it
[1:14:28] what did i do moved right on again
[1:14:31] pentecost saw it
[1:14:32] what they do moved out of the westland
[1:14:34] and nazarenes and so forth what did they
[1:14:36] do
[1:14:36] they built a little fence right called
[1:14:37] we're one this and we're trinity and
[1:14:39] we're the united and all this
[1:14:40] what did he do god moved right on out of
[1:14:42] it see
[1:14:44] we cannot do that we've got to follow
[1:14:47] every day
[1:14:48] every hour of the day every step of the
[1:14:50] way we've got to be led by the lord
[1:14:53] jesus christ
[1:14:57] if we don't we take an organizational
[1:14:59] life
[1:15:00] and a life that doesn't follow christ
[1:15:02] daily is not worthy
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:14] all right we're here to bible study
[1:15:18] this morning right because we wanted we
[1:15:21] want to be
[1:15:22] established in good sound
[1:15:25] firm doctrine the mark of the beast
[1:15:29] when pentecost fell when
[1:15:32] god fell the holy ghost fell the mark of
[1:15:35] the beast fell
[1:15:38] because rejection is to take the mark
[1:15:43] there was many
[1:15:47] great statements about that
[1:15:51] he says and refuse to he says
[1:15:54] now the same thing in the natural
[1:15:56] applies to the spiritual
[1:15:58] that if if we as inheritance of eternal
[1:16:02] life
[1:16:02] and we hear the gospel and know that
[1:16:05] it's true
[1:16:06] and reject it and refuse
[1:16:10] to do it or to listen
[1:16:14] to it we take the mark of the beast
[1:16:17] and so
[1:16:20] that there's a great explanation that
[1:16:23] he's talking and
[1:16:24] and as we listened he talked about they
[1:16:27] no longer
[1:16:28] kept the revelation uh
[1:16:32] it's it's kind of a great
[1:16:35] thing of appreciation but
[1:16:38] he said
[1:16:42] he says when god sends the holy ghost
[1:16:46] and knocks at a man's door
[1:16:48] and he deliberately turns it down
[1:16:51] something
[1:16:51] he's going some day sometime he's going
[1:16:55] to turn it down for the last time
[1:16:57] and then you won't be a privileged
[1:17:01] character so do you understand that
[1:17:05] it's a privilege to have god knocking at
[1:17:08] your heart
[1:17:09] it's a privilege to have god dealing
[1:17:12] with you
[1:17:13] but but understand the consequences
[1:17:17] if you keep turning it down and keep
[1:17:19] turning it down and keep turning it down
[1:17:22] there comes a time where
[1:17:25] okay i get the message
[1:17:29] see we've we've predestinated ourselves
[1:17:34] to such a place that there's no
[1:17:36] consequences
[1:17:38] we can do whatever we want and that
[1:17:42] it just shows there's not that love
[1:17:44] affair now if you're battling something
[1:17:47] in your life and again you've got a
[1:17:48] problem
[1:17:50] and maybe it's less maybe it's alcohol
[1:17:53] maybe it's cigarettes maybe it's the
[1:17:55] flesh
[1:17:56] in any kinds of way there's a lot of
[1:17:58] difference
[1:17:59] when the spirit can bring you under
[1:18:01] conviction
[1:18:02] and you start crying in your heart have
[1:18:05] mercy on me
[1:18:07] father have mercy on me take this from
[1:18:09] me
[1:18:10] i don't want to be like that okay
[1:18:13] and then you you allow the spirit of god
[1:18:17] to work on you and the church
[1:18:21] doesn't condemn that person they wrap
[1:18:23] their arms around that person
[1:18:25] and they pray for that person until that
[1:18:28] person is
[1:18:29] filled with the deliverer
[1:18:34] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:37] not a sympathizer
[1:18:42] i know it's right i i see it's right
[1:18:47] i think it's a great thing he said
[1:18:49] that's just sympathizing with it
[1:18:52] he says you're not a privileged
[1:18:54] character
[1:18:55] you ca you can sit in a
[1:18:58] church and listen to the gospel
[1:19:04] and agree with the gospel
[1:19:11] that's real easy to do isn't it
[1:19:15] because we've got the most vindicated
[1:19:18] most powerful
[1:19:19] explanation of the word nobody's ever
[1:19:22] been able to put the pieces of the
[1:19:23] puzzle
[1:19:24] together like brother brandon we can see
[1:19:27] the picture
[1:19:28] but that's not our question our question
[1:19:31] is
[1:19:31] what is my place what is my role
[1:19:38] you you understand it's an individual
[1:19:40] affair
[1:19:41] and and you know i like i always say
[1:19:44] if you're you're young enough to sit in
[1:19:47] a classroom
[1:19:48] at school and learn math and learn
[1:19:51] english
[1:19:52] and learn algebra and
[1:19:56] science and all the things they teach
[1:19:58] you're old enough to read your bible
[1:20:01] and hear from god
[1:20:06] you just don't want to get too far past
[1:20:09] 18
[1:20:09] 19 20 21 22 years old because it gets
[1:20:13] more difficult
[1:20:15] because your heart gets harder and your
[1:20:18] mind gets more polluted
[1:20:20] so now is the day of salvation when god
[1:20:23] deals with you
[1:20:24] go right now he says
[1:20:28] he said he he said
[1:20:31] and you agree with the gospel you might
[1:20:34] do so much and say i know that it's
[1:20:37] right
[1:20:37] but never put a finger on it
[1:20:41] to help it yourself
[1:20:46] you just listen to it because you say i
[1:20:49] believe it's right
[1:20:50] that's just sympathizing with it
[1:20:57] now let me ask a question i'm not to me
[1:20:59] you're all saints i don't see nothing
[1:21:01] but halos and wings
[1:21:05] okay but you know whether you're
[1:21:07] sympathizing or not
[1:21:09] you know whether you're keeping it in
[1:21:11] your heart
[1:21:14] and it's not going any further
[1:21:20] you know it's like the girls that leave
[1:21:22] leave home with their long dress
[1:21:25] and then they pin their skirts up
[1:21:28] on the bus you know or
[1:21:32] at school you know first thing they go
[1:21:34] and they pin and they
[1:21:36] you know and they slip off their shoes
[1:21:38] and put on their heels and they do
[1:21:40] all this stuff well you know you're not
[1:21:43] fooling you might fool your parents
[1:21:47] but you're you're you're not fooling the
[1:21:50] one that
[1:21:50] wants to give you eternal life
[1:21:54] he said if i had a pill here you would
[1:21:57] come running for this pill
[1:22:00] and yet what is the gospel that we're
[1:22:03] worthy of
[1:22:05] and there's you've got to ask you is
[1:22:06] your life worthy the gospel
[1:22:08] you've got to have have the answer to
[1:22:11] the question
[1:22:12] what is the gospel
[1:22:15] so you know what it is the gospel is
[1:22:19] the lord jesus came to this earth
[1:22:24] paid the price for all your sins well
[1:22:27] you were yet a sinner he was dying on
[1:22:29] the cross for you
[1:22:32] then the gospel is telling you
[1:22:37] that he died and that he has
[1:22:40] eternal life to offer you
[1:22:46] and that you can receive that eternal
[1:22:49] life
[1:22:50] in your life it's a life-changing thing
[1:22:56] but if you reject it what do you get
[1:23:01] the mark of the beast and he says and
[1:23:04] this is eternal life
[1:23:09] and to refuse to do it one day you'll
[1:23:13] cross
[1:23:13] the line between judgment and mercy and
[1:23:16] then
[1:23:17] you won't be you won't be have
[1:23:20] the privilege to come and
[1:23:24] receive it so this that's the gospel
[1:23:29] the gospel is in doctrines and teachings
[1:23:33] and and
[1:23:34] and uh theology
[1:23:38] the gospel is a god
[1:23:41] who is eternal quickening in you
[1:23:46] and putting in you that eternal life
[1:23:50] and that life that eternal life
[1:23:53] which we refer to as the spirit god
[1:23:56] above
[1:23:57] us creating heaven and earth god with us
[1:24:00] redeem us from
[1:24:01] redeeming us from sin now god in us
[1:24:05] eternal life
[1:24:08] because if the spirit that dwelleth
[1:24:11] in christ jesus dwell in you it will
[1:24:14] also
[1:24:15] quicken your mortal body now now listen
[1:24:19] as i read this
[1:24:24] when the trumpet sounds and all want
[1:24:28] you this is paragraph 64.
[1:24:31] out of is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:24:33] if you could put that
[1:24:35] up so we can we want to settle some
[1:24:39] things in our heart
[1:24:42] okay because satan's the author of what
[1:24:45] and how does satan create confusion
[1:24:49] by offering different different
[1:24:52] explanations
[1:24:57] and when the trumpet sounded and all
[1:25:00] wanted to go
[1:25:01] free could go and them that didn't was
[1:25:04] marked
[1:25:06] now you say the mark of the beast
[1:25:09] if we talk about it in the future
[1:25:15] is when it's going to be made manifest
[1:25:20] when you realize it's what
[1:25:23] you've all already done
[1:25:28] oh i thought this was supposed to happen
[1:25:33] and all of a sudden it's on and all of a
[1:25:35] sudden you realize
[1:25:37] what you've done you've rejected
[1:25:40] eternal life so one day that realization
[1:25:44] is going to come
[1:25:46] but what did he talk about making
[1:25:47] excuses making excuses
[1:25:50] someday later i'll get in the ho ho
[1:25:54] you better jump on it now
[1:25:58] let's listen to this great thing that's
[1:26:01] when it's madison
[1:26:03] and so is the holy spirit
[1:26:08] it's to be manifested
[1:26:14] when we see lord jesus coming in glory
[1:26:18] and feel
[1:26:21] the transforming power
[1:26:24] so what is that if that same spirit
[1:26:28] of eternal life
[1:26:31] is in you it will also quicken
[1:26:35] your mortal body so there's gonna come a
[1:26:38] time
[1:26:41] you understand so you don't have to
[1:26:42] worry about the rapture you don't have
[1:26:44] to worry about this you don't have to
[1:26:46] worry about
[1:26:47] when the quickening power is in you
[1:26:50] if the he gave you eternal life and if
[1:26:53] the same spirit that was in christ jesus
[1:26:56] in you
[1:26:57] at that time of quickening
[1:27:00] you feel the quickening taking place
[1:27:07] it's right there
[1:27:11] settle it settle it i'm going to live my
[1:27:15] life i'm going to live according to the
[1:27:16] word of god
[1:27:17] and when the rapture comes i will
[1:27:21] feel the transforming power
[1:27:25] begin to work in me
[1:27:29] because if i have the same spirit
[1:27:32] it will quicken my mortal body the only
[1:27:35] thing
[1:27:36] i've got to have is the spirit that'll
[1:27:39] quicken me
[1:27:45] we see jesus come and glory and feel the
[1:27:48] transforming power
[1:27:50] and see the dead rising out of the grave
[1:27:53] and
[1:27:53] know in a second longer we'll be
[1:27:56] changed and have a body like his
[1:28:00] it'll be made manifested then
[1:28:03] to those who rejected it
[1:28:07] they'll be left down and out
[1:28:12] and i talked about this now looking at
[1:28:15] this last little statement and we'll
[1:28:17] move on to our next tape
[1:28:20] that day will come this is paragraph 71
[1:28:23] out of paragraph 71. that day will come
[1:28:27] except there come a falling away first
[1:28:31] before the man of sin will be revealed
[1:28:36] and the setting in the temple of god
[1:28:40] upholding his forth and now
[1:28:43] this thing's happened
[1:28:47] but it couldn't happen until to falling
[1:28:50] away
[1:28:51] until the church began to get away from
[1:28:54] the spiritual feast
[1:28:58] and draw itself back
[1:29:02] and organize itself
[1:29:08] they had to get away from what
[1:29:12] the spiritual feast
[1:29:15] i wonder if
[1:29:20] i i don't like to talk about the message
[1:29:22] in everybody
[1:29:24] but could it could we possibly
[1:29:28] as a group of people and of sympathizers
[1:29:32] with the gospel
[1:29:35] be getting away from the spiritual
[1:29:38] feast
[1:29:43] okay so
[1:29:46] we believe it we sympathize it we know
[1:29:48] what it says
[1:29:50] but we've we've lacked
[1:29:53] that sitting down and opening the door
[1:29:57] and supping with him and we don't want
[1:30:01] to do that we want to be careful
[1:30:03] he says but it couldn't happen until the
[1:30:06] falling away
[1:30:07] until the church began to get away from
[1:30:09] the spiritual feast
[1:30:10] and draw itself back and organize itself
[1:30:13] and then the revelation didn't stay
[1:30:17] with the church
[1:30:25] i want revelation so do you feel there's
[1:30:29] still
[1:30:30] revelation for you in the word of god
[1:30:33] you still there's still a feast that you
[1:30:36] can feast
[1:30:36] with the word of god that you can still
[1:30:39] grow
[1:30:40] can you can still be quickened and
[1:30:43] and the spirit of god is
[1:30:47] moving on you so the question was
[1:30:52] is your life worthy of the gospel
[1:30:56] so we realized that a life that's worthy
[1:31:00] of the gospel is a life
[1:31:02] that doesn't reject the word of god
[1:31:07] it takes correction
[1:31:12] it takes instructions
[1:31:17] i could say tonight right now
[1:31:20] i could say that
[1:31:24] without taking communion you will not be
[1:31:28] there
[1:31:30] but 50 of you won't come back for
[1:31:32] communion
[1:31:36] 50 of us kevin always miss communion
[1:31:42] what's your excuse
[1:31:48] it's the ordinances of god
[1:31:52] water baptism communion and foot washing
[1:31:56] that's the ordinances the three
[1:31:59] ordinances that we should
[1:32:00] perform the commission
[1:32:05] is to go into all the world and tell the
[1:32:08] world
[1:32:09] about eternal life
[1:32:13] but so we we end up
[1:32:16] playing this sympathizer game
[1:32:20] i'm not your judge your works
[1:32:25] express your faith
[1:32:31] you understand there's something about
[1:32:34] what you do that
[1:32:38] manifests your revelation
[1:32:43] so someone that continually misses
[1:32:46] communion
[1:32:47] has no revelation
[1:32:50] i don't believe that they would do it
[1:32:54] miss it if they had a revelation
[1:32:58] but if they had a revelation and i hope
[1:33:01] i don't sound condescending
[1:33:02] but what i want you to understand is
[1:33:05] really get a grip
[1:33:07] on what he looks at
[1:33:12] you know if you believe something
[1:33:16] then you act accordingly that's a quote
[1:33:22] you act accordingly right
[1:33:26] if you believe you get burned
[1:33:29] putting your hand over the fire
[1:33:33] you just don't go skating your hand in
[1:33:34] the fire
[1:33:37] naturally but we always stick our hand
[1:33:40] in the fire
[1:33:41] spiritually
[1:33:44] so
[1:33:49] okay let's just listen to eight minutes
[1:33:52] now
[1:33:54] so are are you seeing how i'm put trying
[1:33:56] to
[1:33:58] show you something that brother random
[1:34:00] says he says these things
[1:34:02] in all his messages he he lays them out
[1:34:06] there
[1:34:06] if he's just trying to get to the heart
[1:34:09] of his children his sons and daughters
[1:34:13] which are taught by the tudor
[1:34:16] which is the holy spirit so he can tutor
[1:34:20] them
[1:34:21] that they can be positionally placed
[1:34:24] and do something for it
[1:34:28] lift a finger
[1:34:33] and that what we're trying to bring the
[1:34:35] church to
[1:34:36] is where we start lifting our finger
[1:34:39] because we know if we sow will reap
[1:34:46] that's right
[1:34:49] we're going to pick up
[1:34:53] in paragraph 159
[1:35:00] and we're going to go to the end of
[1:35:04] 175.
[1:35:07] these are up or let me
[1:35:10] let me see maybe i'll go a little past
[1:35:14] one
[1:35:18] we'll go through paragraph 183
[1:35:23] and we'll stop at the end of point 83.
[1:35:30] we're going to talk about moses and
[1:35:33] david
[1:35:35] and how that their works
[1:35:39] expressed their revelation
[1:35:42] so we just talked about the offer of
[1:35:45] eternal life
[1:35:46] and it being rejected and that
[1:35:49] the mark of the beast and either you
[1:35:51] have the seal of god or you have the
[1:35:54] mark of the beast
[1:35:55] if i could say it like this either you
[1:35:56] have revelation
[1:35:58] or you don't
[1:36:02] intellect leaves you lukewarm
[1:36:06] it won't let you sell out but it won't
[1:36:09] let you
[1:36:10] go bad just kind of
[1:36:14] trying to figure out where you fit
[1:36:20] okay but now we're talking about people
[1:36:24] that are sold out and
[1:36:28] what that their
[1:36:31] actions were what were their works
[1:36:36] what was the evidence
[1:36:39] of their faith
[1:36:44] now you'll see what pharaoh thought
[1:36:48] the evidence of his faith was
[1:36:51] you'll see what goliath thought
[1:36:54] the evidence of the faith is
[1:36:58] and you'll be able now to understand
[1:37:02] what the world looks for
[1:37:05] as the evidence of your faith
[1:37:11] and the question is will he
[1:37:14] find faith
[1:37:17] when he comes back in other words will
[1:37:21] he find people doing the work of faith
[1:37:25] and so i i you understand why that i'm
[1:37:29] using
[1:37:31] but i'm not using that i want you to
[1:37:33] hear the gospel
[1:37:35] from the servant
[1:37:39] the one that i want to create that
[1:37:42] promise to create in us
[1:37:44] and to compel us to come eat the feast
[1:37:48] don't you think when that prophecy came
[1:37:50] past of the woman
[1:37:52] and vice president in a purple dress
[1:37:58] i mean we had people show up to church
[1:38:01] they've never been here in years and
[1:38:02] years because they were scared to death
[1:38:05] and then it wore off in a few days the
[1:38:08] revelation didn't stick with them and
[1:38:10] then
[1:38:11] they're gone
[1:38:15] right they didn't keep coming to the
[1:38:17] feast
[1:38:19] and the revelation didn't remain with
[1:38:20] the church now let's
[1:38:22] examine ourselves by comparing ourselves
[1:38:26] if i could use that word don't don't
[1:38:28] compare by
[1:38:29] looking at what real revelation did
[1:38:33] in real believers
[1:38:37] eight minutes and then we'll close here
[1:38:38] in just a little bit
[1:38:43] moses with a stick in his hand came to
[1:38:46] take the people from pharaoh
[1:38:50] now could you imagine moses the bible
[1:38:52] said that he was taught in all the
[1:38:54] wisdom of the egyptians
[1:38:56] he was smart he could teach their
[1:38:58] intellects things
[1:38:59] he is taught all their wisdom he didn't
[1:39:01] need to catch up on his education
[1:39:04] now you just think about a man out there
[1:39:05] in the wilderness with all that
[1:39:07] education
[1:39:09] and then god appearing to him and said
[1:39:11] moses
[1:39:12] take this stick in your hand and go down
[1:39:15] there in egypt and bring my children out
[1:39:17] with this switch you got your hand
[1:39:20] just lick the whole thing with this
[1:39:21] switch
[1:39:23] now what if moses said sir just a moment
[1:39:26] i thought i was talking to an
[1:39:28] intelligent being
[1:39:29] this great i am that you say you are now
[1:39:32] how in the world would i ever take this
[1:39:34] little
[1:39:34] old crooked stick i got here in my hand
[1:39:37] and take over an
[1:39:38] army of million a man armed with spears
[1:39:40] fighters and i'm not a fighter i'm a
[1:39:42] shepherd
[1:39:44] how can i ever do that there was no
[1:39:46] question
[1:39:48] why why
[1:39:51] the ground in his heart he was a
[1:39:54] predestinated person
[1:39:57] gifts and callings are without
[1:39:58] repentance god who told abraham that he
[1:40:01] would do that
[1:40:02] and there was the ground prepared and
[1:40:05] moses took this stick
[1:40:07] and went down there and tucked that
[1:40:10] nation out of a nation
[1:40:13] when he come with the stick in his hand
[1:40:15] and told pharaoh let him go
[1:40:18] pharaoh seen in moses
[1:40:22] the works that he had faith in what he
[1:40:25] was going to do or trying to do
[1:40:27] he had faith in the promise of the god
[1:40:29] and made the promise
[1:40:31] he went down to take it over no other
[1:40:34] man would have done that
[1:40:35] and no other man could have done it he
[1:40:38] was ordained to do it
[1:40:40] god beforehand had told abraham that's
[1:40:43] that's just what would happen
[1:40:45] and when the time of the promise drew
[1:40:46] nigh there was a little boy born
[1:40:50] a fair child and the parents amarama
[1:40:53] jose bell
[1:40:54] was not afraid of the king's
[1:40:55] commandments see there was something
[1:40:58] the grounds was already prepared
[1:41:02] oh god i hope i'm speaking to the ground
[1:41:05] prepared tonight
[1:41:08] if the seed can fall in the right place
[1:41:11] and it's going to be so if it isn't it
[1:41:13] won't happen that's the
[1:41:15] same thing would you say brother brahm
[1:41:16] that kind of takes it away from us if it
[1:41:18] does it takes away from christianity too
[1:41:20] see you can impersonate anything but
[1:41:23] if it really falls in the word of god
[1:41:26] falls in the right kind of ground
[1:41:27] it's going to bring forth its kind it's
[1:41:30] got to because
[1:41:31] it's a seed noah moses his works express
[1:41:35] faith in the promise of the god that he
[1:41:38] believed
[1:41:38] pharaoh the man could see what was
[1:41:42] not he couldn't see how moses is going
[1:41:44] to do it but he knows moses believed
[1:41:46] what he was talking about
[1:41:48] or he wouldn't be standing in the palace
[1:41:49] out of the stick in his hand said by
[1:41:50] this stick i'll take him out from him
[1:41:54] an old man 80 years old not an athlete
[1:41:58] an old man stoop short and whiskers
[1:42:00] hanging down to his
[1:42:01] probably his waistline gray hair if he
[1:42:03] had any
[1:42:04] and there was that stick in his hand
[1:42:06] saying i'm gonna take him out
[1:42:08] let the people go thus saith the lord
[1:42:11] if you don't do it god's going to judge
[1:42:14] you
[1:42:14] amen why that's
[1:42:18] he was he afraid why just one arrow one
[1:42:21] spear anything else would have ended he
[1:42:22] was
[1:42:23] fearless you know exactly where he was
[1:42:26] standing
[1:42:27] the god smithy pharaoh
[1:42:30] yes sir for god told him you will come
[1:42:33] to this mountain again
[1:42:35] and he knows he was going there
[1:42:38] hallelujah
[1:42:40] we know where we're going to at the end
[1:42:42] of this journey
[1:42:43] god has promised there's a land beyond
[1:42:45] the river
[1:42:48] be fearless in your testimony amen
[1:42:52] if it's revealed to you are fearless you
[1:42:55] don't care for the whole world what they
[1:42:57] say
[1:42:59] you're fearless when it's revealed to
[1:43:01] you that this is the truth
[1:43:03] coming from god then you'll be fearless
[1:43:07] not you can't be david with a shepherd
[1:43:11] slain
[1:43:12] expressed to the whole israelite army
[1:43:16] the faith that he had in their god
[1:43:21] now there was goliath on the other side
[1:43:24] and he stood out there and made his
[1:43:25] voice many times bigger than david had
[1:43:28] fingers 14 inches long
[1:43:30] and he was a man with big fella the
[1:43:33] philistine shine
[1:43:35] and here was david the smallest one it
[1:43:36] was even too little to be any army
[1:43:39] too much of a run they couldn't use him
[1:43:42] so his brothers is out there in the army
[1:43:44] and then glath is making his boast but
[1:43:47] david
[1:43:48] now remember it was revealed to david
[1:43:53] he thought here is the armies of the
[1:43:56] living god
[1:43:58] standing in their own land and there's a
[1:44:01] boasting uncircumcised philistine out
[1:44:04] there
[1:44:04] we'll call him cancer tonight we're
[1:44:07] calling paralytic
[1:44:10] why david was no kind of a match for him
[1:44:14] not with any kind of a weapon he was no
[1:44:17] match
[1:44:17] that man's shoulders was probably 10 12
[1:44:20] foot across
[1:44:20] is probably standing 14 15 foot high a
[1:44:23] spear like a weaver's needle probably 20
[1:44:25] foot long
[1:44:26] the blade on it maybe four foot across
[1:44:29] and a little david stand there with a
[1:44:31] little piece of leather gold skin or
[1:44:33] sheepskin
[1:44:34] with two pieces of string tied to it
[1:44:37] but it was revealed to him
[1:44:41] revelation struck him amen
[1:44:44] he said the god that took me out of the
[1:44:47] paws of the bear
[1:44:49] that took me out of the paws of the line
[1:44:51] how much more will he deliver that
[1:44:52] uncircumcised philistine to my hand
[1:44:57] his brothers way more able to do it
[1:45:00] saul head and shoulders above his army
[1:45:02] but you see it wasn't revealed to them
[1:45:06] amen there it is
[1:45:11] they believed it could be done they
[1:45:13] believe that god could do it
[1:45:15] but it wasn't revealed to them
[1:45:18] but it was revealed to david now there's
[1:45:22] a difference right there
[1:45:24] if it's absolutely revealed to you
[1:45:27] that god is going to heal you you're
[1:45:30] going to get it
[1:45:32] you're going to get i don't care what's
[1:45:33] wrong with you what the odds that may be
[1:45:35] worse than david and god
[1:45:38] but if it's revealed to you and notice
[1:45:40] when it's revealed
[1:45:41] david becomes fearless
[1:45:46] he said the day i'll cut your head off
[1:45:52] our god by grace in that
[1:45:55] crucial moment
[1:45:58] when decisions had to be made
[1:46:02] that same god that produced a grace in
[1:46:04] that day and dropped that seed of faith
[1:46:06] in that little hunchback looking boys
[1:46:09] being in his heart that same god in this
[1:46:12] crucial moment can take that woman from
[1:46:14] the wheelchair
[1:46:14] that man and a child
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:20] that little greed of faith is revealed
[1:46:23] to you
[1:46:25] and i don't care how long it takes now
[1:46:28] notice
[1:46:29] the giant on the other side didn't
[1:46:31] believe it neither would the cancer
[1:46:34] elect you said to my dog you send that
[1:46:37] kid out here to fight me so i'll pick
[1:46:39] you up on the end of the spear and let
[1:46:40] the birds eat your flesh
[1:46:42] why he had all the everything for his
[1:46:45] son
[1:46:46] but you see that didn't shake david at
[1:46:48] all
[1:46:50] why it was revealed to him he had faith
[1:46:53] in what he was doing
[1:46:54] he knowed he was going to do it
[1:46:57] and he did it it's because that it was
[1:47:00] revealed to him and he knowed where he's
[1:47:02] standing
[1:47:04] and if god would respond right down in
[1:47:06] your heart tonight said
[1:47:08] you're not going to be laying in that
[1:47:09] bed you're not going to be setting that
[1:47:11] chair
[1:47:12] you're going to be well there couldn't
[1:47:14] be anything
[1:47:15] change your mind in it but until that
[1:47:18] happens
[1:47:20] every preacher in the world could pray i
[1:47:22] don't say it wouldn't help you
[1:47:23] it would encourage you but until that
[1:47:25] faith
[1:47:27] see the healing power is in you
[1:47:31] it don't come from the preacher it comes
[1:47:34] to you by
[1:47:36] revelation by faith not by power
[1:47:39] not by might but by my spirit saith the
[1:47:42] lord
[1:47:43] my spirit by grace reveals this to you
[1:47:47] and there's nothing to take it away by
[1:47:50] faith
[1:47:51] revelation then david to prove his works
[1:47:55] now some of them said i know you're
[1:47:57] naughty this brother said
[1:47:59] you come up here to see the battle now
[1:48:01] you get on back where them sheep was he
[1:48:02] said let me speak to saul
[1:48:04] the general and saul said now son i
[1:48:07] admire your courage
[1:48:09] but you see you're nothing but a youth
[1:48:11] and he is a warrior from his youth
[1:48:13] you're no match for him
[1:48:15] he said i was standing my father's sheep
[1:48:20] he could base it on something amen
[1:48:24] oh brother and the god that saved your
[1:48:28] soul can he heal your body
[1:48:34] but just the same revealed you he's your
[1:48:36] healer as he was your savior
[1:48:39] but it's got to be revealed first that's
[1:48:42] the difference
[1:48:45] he had something to base his faith on he
[1:48:47] said now this never happened before but
[1:48:49] said the same god
[1:48:52] that delivered me from the pause of the
[1:48:53] line will deliver me from that
[1:48:55] uncircumcised philistine
[1:48:56] how you know david i believe it
[1:49:00] why it's been revealed to me and he said
[1:49:16] all right another great
[1:49:21] thing we want to have settled
[1:49:25] it's a revelation
[1:49:29] you understand that and so we want to
[1:49:32] talk just about
[1:49:33] a little bit because we see that
[1:49:36] moses believed what
[1:49:40] god revealed to him and his works
[1:49:43] showed it the actions that
[1:49:46] he took expressed it
[1:49:50] and and brought it
[1:49:54] to pass and i i don't
[1:49:58] want to go down that road
[1:50:02] of talking about revelation and
[1:50:06] and talking about faith because
[1:50:10] we have such a tendency to try to muster
[1:50:13] up
[1:50:14] faith instead of just
[1:50:17] waiting on the lord
[1:50:21] you know i mean it's because it's the
[1:50:24] same
[1:50:24] faith at revelation that saved you
[1:50:29] is the same revelation that
[1:50:32] heals you so it's
[1:50:36] a revelation but i want to
[1:50:40] take a moment to
[1:50:43] take a paragraph
[1:50:47] and just give us a kind of an
[1:50:51] understanding on
[1:50:54] this great paragraph
[1:50:58] because i find so many christians
[1:51:02] come under condemnation when
[1:51:06] he speaks about these signs shall follow
[1:51:09] them
[1:51:09] that believe and we get
[1:51:13] to the place that we think that
[1:51:16] we have to have miracles
[1:51:21] all the time and i i just want to
[1:51:25] uh i just felt in my heart
[1:51:28] in closing this morning just to
[1:51:32] give a little example so
[1:51:35] you can just be anchored in your heart i
[1:51:38] thought brother randy did a nice job
[1:51:41] on touching this so i need a couple
[1:51:43] brothers you brothers
[1:51:44] come up here
[1:51:50] i love your beard brother do you put dye
[1:51:53] in it to get it black i don't know mine
[1:51:55] comes out gray
[1:51:57] all right so here's two great men here
[1:52:00] sitting here you guys stand and look
[1:52:02] at me right over here all right
[1:52:05] you stand right here and look at me okay
[1:52:08] who wants to be the believer
[1:52:11] okay you you
[1:52:14] you hesitated too long
[1:52:17] so for today you are going to play the
[1:52:21] role of an
[1:52:21] unbeliever
[1:52:25] now we get to the place that
[1:52:28] we think that we've got to produce
[1:52:31] miracles that if i'm a
[1:52:35] i'm a believer
[1:52:38] then i ought to have miracles if you
[1:52:42] listen to what we
[1:52:43] said moses was a believer
[1:52:47] and because he was a believer he
[1:52:50] delivered
[1:52:51] the message
[1:52:55] the message was go tell pharaoh to let
[1:52:58] my people go
[1:53:00] that was the gospel
[1:53:03] that moses received
[1:53:07] so moses just went and delivered
[1:53:10] the message that's what he did
[1:53:15] david knowing he was anointed king
[1:53:20] knowing that god had delivered
[1:53:25] the bear and the lion in his hand
[1:53:30] he delivered the message
[1:53:33] now we get to the place that we
[1:53:37] think that we have to
[1:53:41] have some power
[1:53:44] within us but we don't
[1:53:49] we just have to have a revelation
[1:53:52] of what we believe now listen what he
[1:53:56] says here
[1:53:57] until that happened every preacher in
[1:54:00] the world could pray
[1:54:02] i don't say it wouldn't help you it
[1:54:04] would encourage
[1:54:05] you but until that faith
[1:54:08] seek the healing power is in you
[1:54:13] it don't come from the preacher
[1:54:16] it comes to you by revelation
[1:54:19] by faith so we're commissioned to go in
[1:54:24] the world and preach the gospel
[1:54:26] in other words to tell people about
[1:54:28] eternal life
[1:54:30] we believe that we have a revelation for
[1:54:33] that
[1:54:34] now all i can do
[1:54:37] is give the opportunity christ
[1:54:40] gave them the opportunity to come to my
[1:54:44] feast
[1:54:45] the feast of pentecost which meant 50.
[1:54:48] in other words all you can do is present
[1:54:52] the opportunity
[1:54:57] but where is it the healing power
[1:55:00] is in you so here is a
[1:55:03] sorry brother you're just
[1:55:06] this is a fleshly representation but i
[1:55:10] know the seeds in there
[1:55:11] so here is an unbeliever
[1:55:15] right in our story now all i
[1:55:19] can do to that unbeliever is present to
[1:55:22] him
[1:55:22] the opportunity jesus is here
[1:55:27] if you will repent of your sins and
[1:55:29] realize you're wrong
[1:55:31] and repent and be baptized in any lord
[1:55:34] you guys you shall receive the gift of
[1:55:36] the holy spirit
[1:55:37] god sent us the word of god fresh manna
[1:55:40] in this day
[1:55:42] not an old gospel but fresh manna
[1:55:46] that's delivered to this day and i i
[1:55:50] i lay it out there to him
[1:55:54] and he rejects it
[1:55:59] he's not a believer there's no faith in
[1:56:02] him
[1:56:03] there's no revelation right
[1:56:06] so he just rejects it he says
[1:56:10] sorry old man you're little nuts
[1:56:15] so he just walks away you can go say
[1:56:17] that thank you brother
[1:56:19] he just walked away the same
[1:56:26] gospel
[1:56:28] now the the healing isn't in the
[1:56:32] preacher
[1:56:34] it's in you because the scripture says
[1:56:37] to
[1:56:37] them that believe not
[1:56:42] are damned them that believed
[1:56:46] are saved saved from drinking safe from
[1:56:49] smoking say from alcohol
[1:56:51] not only eternal life but they're saved
[1:56:54] for whatever they're in bondage in
[1:56:57] now i bring the same gospel to him
[1:57:02] so really all i'm doing
[1:57:05] is i'm i'm giving them the opportunity
[1:57:11] right the opportunity to believe
[1:57:17] that i'm giving him the chance
[1:57:20] or the choice to reject or receive
[1:57:25] because faith cometh by hearing
[1:57:28] and hearing by the word of god now
[1:57:31] what's going to compel me
[1:57:34] into action is the fact that i
[1:57:38] have a revelation i'm the believer in
[1:57:41] the word
[1:57:42] and the word says if i go carry out my
[1:57:46] commission
[1:57:49] and i go preach the word of god
[1:57:53] tell the truth tell how my candle got
[1:57:55] lit
[1:57:56] i'm fearless in my testimony
[1:58:02] i'm not ashamed that the world rejects
[1:58:04] this message
[1:58:06] i'm not ashamed that they we don't
[1:58:08] believe in the trinity
[1:58:10] i've had a revelation from god that this
[1:58:13] is
[1:58:14] absolutely the truth
[1:58:18] it's fresh manna
[1:58:22] therefore i'm standing in front of the
[1:58:24] mayor
[1:58:25] with my gospel stick
[1:58:33] now he's going to see
[1:58:37] my unbeliever saul i believe what i'm
[1:58:38] believing
[1:58:42] i proved to him that i believe
[1:58:46] what i believe by the very testimony
[1:58:49] that comes out of my mouth
[1:58:53] the very fact that i live eat and
[1:58:54] breathe it
[1:58:56] but now i come to this guy i give him
[1:58:58] the same gospel
[1:59:02] that i gave the unbeliever i
[1:59:05] share the same thing
[1:59:09] but he's a believer
[1:59:12] god gives him the what the revelation
[1:59:17] now he becomes the believer
[1:59:21] and the sign follows him
[1:59:25] not the preacher
[1:59:30] i like what randy is the mailman
[1:59:34] he opens the letter he's the believer
[1:59:39] these signs shall follow them that
[1:59:42] believe
[1:59:44] what i say to them and so he's a
[1:59:46] believer
[1:59:48] now whatever it is that he has needed
[1:59:53] he accepts the word of god because it's
[1:59:55] revealed to him and the sign
[1:59:58] follows him it's not attached to the
[2:00:02] preacher
[2:00:05] see healing power is in you it don't
[2:00:08] come from the preacher it comes to you
[2:00:12] by revelation
[2:00:16] so all you can do is give
[2:00:19] somebody the opportunity to hear
[2:00:24] if i don't see you tomorrow i'll see in
[2:00:25] the rapture okay because you're a
[2:00:27] believer okay
[2:00:28] god bless you and you'll be there too
[2:00:31] because
[2:00:32] he said all that i love then all that
[2:00:34] love me will be there
[2:00:35] so you're there too
[2:00:40] see when when we let
[2:00:44] our revelation of what's been revealed
[2:00:48] to us
[2:00:48] because remember he said the revelation
[2:00:51] won't always stay with the church
[2:00:55] in other words they come cold they come
[2:00:57] lukewarm
[2:00:58] they're not on fire this i remember when
[2:01:01] i first
[2:01:02] saw malachi 4 5
[2:01:06] at the end time message
[2:01:10] man i just couldn't be still
[2:01:14] but he says what do they do they pull
[2:01:17] back
[2:01:20] and they denominate
[2:01:24] i believe in church order because the
[2:01:26] holy spirit does all things
[2:01:27] decently but church order never
[2:01:31] was the identification of the church
[2:01:37] the identification of the church
[2:01:41] was people
[2:01:45] that carried out the commission
[2:01:50] go into all the world if you're ashamed
[2:01:53] of me before men
[2:01:54] i'll be ashamed of you before my father
[2:01:58] you don't have to worry all you have is
[2:02:01] you've got your
[2:02:03] faith you have what's revealed to you
[2:02:06] and the gospel is spread from faith
[2:02:11] to faith
[2:02:15] from revelation
[2:02:18] to revelation
[2:02:22] i say the word he gets the revelation
[2:02:25] so it came from revelation to revelation
[2:02:28] if he believes he can receive what he
[2:02:33] has need of
[2:02:35] if i lay my hands on him because he's
[2:02:37] sick
[2:02:39] and he believes he'll get well if the
[2:02:42] power is in me
[2:02:45] then i should be able to lay my hands on
[2:02:47] the unbeliever
[2:02:49] and get the same results
[2:02:54] no my work is standing with the stick
[2:02:59] my work is standing with
[2:03:02] the sling
[2:03:06] my work is expressing
[2:03:11] the revelation moses was expressing the
[2:03:14] revelation that god gave him david was
[2:03:16] expressing the revelation that god told
[2:03:18] him
[2:03:19] we express the revelation
[2:03:22] that god's given us there was a message
[2:03:25] that was sent
[2:03:26] to restore us in a union with the
[2:03:29] bridegroom
[2:03:30] to become one and
[2:03:35] my duty is
[2:03:38] to give
[2:03:42] opportunity because the signs
[2:03:46] they follow the believer not the speaker
[2:03:51] they follow they hear
[2:03:55] because faith comes by hearing and
[2:03:58] hearing by
[2:04:00] the word of god so we understand what's
[2:04:03] transpiring
[2:04:05] there's people that live a life
[2:04:10] worthy of the gospel david and moses
[2:04:14] lived a life and testified
[2:04:17] to their revelation it proved
[2:04:21] that they believed and
[2:04:24] others that don't lift a finger
[2:04:28] to do anything about it are identified
[2:04:31] as sympathizers
[2:04:34] and what our hearts desire
[2:04:38] is is to get every
[2:04:41] member of this local body
[2:04:46] on fire for god
[2:04:50] working for god sharing this gospel
[2:04:53] reaching out all you can do is tell
[2:04:56] somebody
[2:04:59] and if it awakens that seed within them
[2:05:02] they will have the signs to prove
[2:05:07] that they believe
[2:05:10] but let's not neglect our commission
[2:05:14] to go into all the world preaching the
[2:05:17] gospel
[2:05:19] them that believe shall be saved and
[2:05:22] them that believe not
[2:05:24] shall be damned go out baptizing them
[2:05:28] in the name of the father son and holy
[2:05:30] ghost not three titles
[2:05:33] not three names but the name
[2:05:36] of the three offices in which god
[2:05:39] manifested himself
[2:05:44] and those that believe shall receive the
[2:05:46] holy ghost
[2:05:49] and there are so many other things there
[2:05:51] that just keep rolling on
[2:05:53] but i think if we could get a fun
[2:05:57] kind of a fundamental understanding of
[2:06:00] the mark of the beast
[2:06:02] that fundamental revelation of what's
[2:06:04] going to transpire
[2:06:05] at the rapture and that fundamental duty
[2:06:09] that we have is believers to share
[2:06:13] now from that point all you have to do
[2:06:16] is
[2:06:17] deal with the excuses
[2:06:21] right we don't want any of those but
[2:06:24] we're going to baptize somebody now and
[2:06:27] so brother billy if you could come and
[2:06:29] lead and worship and who's going to be
[2:06:30] baptized where are you brother
[2:06:32] okay our brother's going to come and be
[2:06:35] baptized this morning
[2:06:36] and and
[2:06:40] he just feels on his heart and
[2:06:44] he called he wants to be baptized he
[2:06:46] knows it's the right thing to do
[2:06:48] and so if he's believing
[2:06:52] we know the sign that will follow he
[2:06:54] shall receive the holy ghost
[2:06:56] if you need to go this morning let's
[2:06:59] just stand for a moment we'll have a
[2:07:00] word of prayer and
[2:07:02] while we're standing if you need to slip
[2:07:04] out we certainly understand that
[2:07:06] this morning and we just say a word of
[2:07:09] prayer together
[2:07:10] our gracious heavenly father
[2:07:13] this morning we've just taken a moment
[2:07:16] to
[2:07:17] go into the storehouse and receive
[2:07:20] some real foundation teaching
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:30] about
[2:07:35] how we express that we're worthy of the
[2:07:38] gospel
[2:07:40] how we understand that the gospel is the
[2:07:43] gift of eternal life
[2:07:45] the revelation of eternal life
[2:07:49] and who the signs follow
[2:07:53] them that believe and lord we need you
[2:07:57] so much in our lives
[2:08:01] and i believe that we're all here this
[2:08:03] morning wanting to break through the
[2:08:04] higher ground
[2:08:07] wanting to be about your business and
[2:08:12] we want to express the revelation that
[2:08:15] you've given us
[2:08:17] we don't want to be sympathizers we want
[2:08:20] to be workers
[2:08:22] we want to share the hope that we have
[2:08:27] in our lord jesus the hope of the
[2:08:29] rapture
[2:08:31] the hope of this by his stripes we are
[2:08:34] healed
[2:08:35] the hope of deliverance we want to share
[2:08:38] that that same jesus is alive and
[2:08:41] present
[2:08:42] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:08:45] father we call out for
[2:08:49] to our hearts and our our body here
[2:08:51] together

[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:36] i lost
[2:16:48] [Music]
[2:17:09] praise the lord this is the wonderful
[2:17:12] evidence that the gospel is being
[2:17:16] spread amen in that he's still
[2:17:19] calling and if he's still calling he's
[2:17:22] still
[2:17:23] filling with the holy ghost
[2:17:26] and all men will struggle with the flesh
[2:17:31] until they get supernatural help
[2:17:35] from above and
[2:17:38] it's it's a hard battle to win
[2:17:42] it's like satan trying to cast out satan
[2:17:46] because we're born in sin and shaped in
[2:17:48] iniquity
[2:17:50] but when we receive that great help
[2:17:53] from the outside the holy spirit
[2:17:58] and then the holy spirit comes in and
[2:18:00] cleanses us
[2:18:02] from all unrighteousness and our brother
[2:18:05] today wants to be baptized in the name
[2:18:07] lord jesus christ he's seen it in god's
[2:18:09] word
[2:18:11] and by carrying out and being obedient
[2:18:15] to god's word he's privileged
[2:18:19] to receive the promise that follows
[2:18:23] and we believe
[2:18:26] that that sign will come to the believer
[2:18:30] it's not by the preacher it's by the
[2:18:33] believer
[2:18:33] and our brother believes so if we turn
[2:18:36] in our scriptures to acts
[2:18:38] the second chapter
[2:18:42] and the 36th verse
[2:18:46] the men have just come out and their
[2:18:49] lives
[2:18:50] were manifesting
[2:18:53] what was prophesied by joel
[2:18:57] the outpouring of the spirit and so
[2:19:00] because that was manifested in them they
[2:19:03] began to testify
[2:19:05] men and brethren these are not drunk as
[2:19:07] you suppose but this is what was
[2:19:09] promised
[2:19:11] and we see what followed
[2:19:14] so it's beautiful therefore let all of
[2:19:18] the house of israel knowed surely
[2:19:21] that god hath made the same jesus
[2:19:25] whom he have crucified both
[2:19:28] lord and christ and when they
[2:19:31] heard this they were pricked in their
[2:19:34] heart
[2:19:35] and said unto peter and the rest of the
[2:19:39] apostles
[2:19:40] men and brethren what shall we do
[2:19:44] and peter said unto them repent
[2:19:48] and be baptized every one of you
[2:19:51] in the name of jesus christ for the
[2:19:54] remission of sins
[2:19:56] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[2:19:59] holy ghost
[2:20:00] for the promises unto you and to your
[2:20:04] children
[2:20:05] and to all that are afar off even as
[2:20:08] many as our lord our god shall call
[2:20:12] and with many other words did he testify
[2:20:15] and exhort saying
[2:20:16] save yourselves from this up-torch
[2:20:19] generation
[2:20:20] brother john has come today to save
[2:20:23] himself
[2:20:24] from this world and
[2:20:28] for the remission of his sins which he
[2:20:31] has repented of he's going to be
[2:20:32] baptized
[2:20:34] and how many believe you'll receive the
[2:20:35] holy ghost
[2:20:37] amen i certainly do amen do you have the
[2:20:41] handkerchief
[2:20:42] okay our gracious heavenly father
[2:20:47] brother john has come to be baptized
[2:20:51] he heard your servant compel him to this
[2:20:55] pool
[2:20:56] and father we're just here to carry out
[2:20:59] the commission
[2:21:01] the lord we believe with our brother
[2:21:03] that by being baptized
[2:21:05] that your spirit will come into his life
[2:21:09] and give him the deliverances and the
[2:21:12] leadership
[2:21:13] that his heart desires
[2:21:16] brother john according to the gospel
[2:21:20] and the commission to go into the world
[2:21:22] baptizing them
[2:21:24] in the name of the father the son and
[2:21:26] holy ghost
[2:21:27] on the day of pentecost when the first
[2:21:29] baptisms were performed
[2:21:32] by divine revelation peter knew what
[2:21:34] that name was
[2:21:35] it was the lord jesus christ and
[2:21:38] according to the scriptures i baptize
[2:21:40] you
