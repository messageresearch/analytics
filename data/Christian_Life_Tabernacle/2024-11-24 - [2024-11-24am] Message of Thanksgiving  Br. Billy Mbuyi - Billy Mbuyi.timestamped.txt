[39:17] want to continue to remember our pastor
[39:19] like I said and sister Genie and and all
[39:21] the other requests that we put in let's
[39:23] open our Bibles this morning um
[39:33] uh Romans chapter 7 a very familiar
[39:36] scripture reading I just want to speak
[39:39] on Thanksgiving for a little bit um I
[39:42] know that uh you
[39:46] know the people are already buying the
[39:48] turkeys and getting everything ready and
[39:51] you know you don't want to go on Friday
[39:53] because all the turkeys will be gone and
[39:56] the checkout line will be very long so
[39:59] um uh they I believe they announced that
[40:02] there's no service on Wednesday so uh we
[40:04] don't have service on Wednesday so uh
[40:07] Romans chapter 7
[40:10] um verse one it
[40:12] says know ye not brethren for I speak to
[40:16] them that know the law how that the law
[40:19] has dominion over a man as long as he
[40:21] liveth for the
[40:23] woman which has a husband is bound by
[40:27] law to her husband as long as he liveth
[40:31] but if the if the husband be dead she is
[40:35] loosed from the law of the husband so
[40:39] then if while her husband liveth she is
[40:42] married to another she shall be called
[40:44] an adulteress but if the husband be dead
[40:48] she's free from the law so that she's
[40:51] not adulteress
[40:54] adulteress though she be married to
[40:56] another wherefore my brethren ye also
[40:59] are become Dead from the law by the body
[41:02] of of of Christ that you should not be
[41:05] married you should that you should be
[41:07] married to another even to him who
[41:10] raised from the dead that we should
[41:13] bring forth fruits unto God for it says
[41:18] for when we were in
[41:20] flesh the Motions of sins which were
[41:24] which were by the by the law did work in
[41:26] our members to bring forth fruit unto
[41:29] death but now we are delivered from the
[41:32] law and being dead where where wherein
[41:35] we were held that we should serve in
[41:39] newness of spirit not in the oldness of
[41:42] the latter I love that amen let's also
[41:45] turn in Psalm 107
[41:48] verse1 Psalm 107
[41:53] verse1 it
[41:55] says oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[41:59] his
[42:00] goodness for his mercy endureth
[42:04] forever let the redeem of the Lord say
[42:07] so whom he had redeemed from the hands
[42:11] of the
[42:12] enemy and gather them out of the land
[42:16] from the East and from the west from the
[42:18] north and from the south I believe that
[42:21] scripture is very applicable this
[42:23] morning they wandered in Wilderness in
[42:26] solitary way they found no City to dwell
[42:30] in hungry and thirsty their soul fended
[42:34] in them then they Cried unto the Lord in
[42:38] their trouble and they delivered them
[42:40] out of the distress Lord and they LED
[42:42] them forth by the right by the right way
[42:46] that they might go to a city of
[42:51] habitation oh that men should would
[42:54] praise the Lord for his goodness for his
[42:57] wonderful works for the children of men
[43:01] let's just bow our heads gracious father
[43:03] we ask that you bless your word to us
[43:05] this morning we're commit it to you in
[43:07] the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen
[43:10] amen God bless you may have your
[43:17] seats just want to speak for a moment
[43:27] and my title is a message of
[43:31] Thanksgiving a message of Thanksgiving I
[43:35] I I was studying
[43:37] from uh the message butam preach uh the
[43:42] invisible Union and
[43:45] uh I if you ever get a chance to listen
[43:49] in that message if and I'm pretty sure
[43:51] you have uh it's just one of those that
[43:55] uh you you can never get tired of
[43:57] listening too and and every time you
[44:00] listen the Lord is continually speaking
[44:02] to us and and I was listening to it and
[44:06] brother ram calls it his message of
[44:09] Thanksgiving and I just thought about
[44:11] you know if this morning we were to be
[44:13] thankful what exactly are we thankful
[44:16] for you know I I thought when we think
[44:19] about
[44:20] Thanksgiving no doubt is a day and the
[44:23] season to be thankful and when you are
[44:26] thankful uh one of the first thing you
[44:28] do is you you have to bring things in
[44:31] remembrance you have to to to uh bring
[44:34] things in remembrance of what is it that
[44:36] you are thankful about and we can look
[44:39] at our natural uh life and our flesh as
[44:42] we are this morning and I believe each
[44:45] one can be certainly uh uh recognize
[44:48] what they are thankful for um one of the
[44:51] things in my life I always do as a habit
[44:54] is uh every once in a while it's
[44:56] important important you know the devil
[44:58] tried to get us into a situation where
[45:00] we're constantly fighting right you you
[45:03] are constantly in a war this comes up
[45:05] you got to win this battle you got to go
[45:07] take care of this you got to go take
[45:09] care of that and you really never get a
[45:11] time to just sit still and and and and
[45:13] and think about where you at you know I
[45:16] believe bam will say it in the way that
[45:18] you will always uh a man has always had
[45:21] the effit of looking at God what he done
[45:23] in the past and continually looking
[45:25] forward for what to come and never
[45:27] really taking the time to look at what
[45:29] God is doing in the present and that's
[45:32] human nature we look at ourselves we can
[45:34] recognize that and I'll say this even we
[45:36] can certainly look at ourselves and if
[45:38] we are honest with ourselves this
[45:40] morning you can look at yourself and say
[45:42] that in the flesh this morning as you
[45:44] sit here somebody helped you to be where
[45:47] you are
[45:49] today you you didn't get there by
[45:51] yourself and I'm talking about in the
[45:53] flesh you can realize that uh perhaps
[45:56] along the way way you needed help
[45:58] somewhere you were in trouble you got in
[46:00] trouble somewhere somebody came and hand
[46:02] you a hand and you something went wrong
[46:05] you were hungry somebody fed you whether
[46:07] it be your parents or whoever that is
[46:09] and somebody came to your rescue you
[46:11] came to a place you had a a a tire that
[46:15] broke a car that broke down or you were
[46:17] in an accident somebody stepped in and
[46:19] come and help you so you when you sit
[46:22] you look along the way you will see that
[46:24] somebody was always there to help you
[46:26] and and it was there to come to your
[46:28] rescue no matter what you were going
[46:30] through and and and we have to be
[46:32] thankful for that we have to recognize
[46:35] that we didn't get out here because of
[46:37] Our Own Strength because of our own
[46:38] ability that we did so well you we
[46:41] educated ourselves and we did this
[46:43] that's what we are even even as far as
[46:46] work is concerned I remember I was just
[46:48] working and uh I I I I started off I was
[46:51] trying to get a certain position and and
[46:54] and I couldn't get it and I was working
[46:57] just as a technician and and somebody
[46:59] one day just walked in and and they
[47:01] asked me and I what what is it that you
[47:04] like I said oh I would love to do this
[47:05] and this and that position was not there
[47:08] they were offering me something else
[47:10] that would take me away from church and
[47:12] and I and I and I turned it down and and
[47:14] and and and then this guy just came by
[47:18] out of nowhere he said well for some
[47:20] reason I would like to take this
[47:22] position that's over there would like to
[47:24] create it so we have somebody who can do
[47:26] the same thing and out of nowhere
[47:28] something just came along and what was
[47:31] it it was God looking out for you
[47:33] naturally uh perhaps you were in a
[47:35] circumstance where the doctors has
[47:37] already spoken and say this is not going
[47:39] to happen you you know your situation
[47:42] we're looking at it it looks like it's
[47:43] bad and everything and and and and and
[47:46] I'm saying this is even while we were
[47:49] yet in sin I'm not talking about while
[47:51] we Sav and all of the sudden they said
[47:53] well let's do another skin and let's do
[47:55] another and they come and said well it's
[47:57] no longer there we're no longer going to
[47:58] go with the process that we thought we
[48:00] were going to do who was it somebody was
[48:03] looking out for you oh I tell you if you
[48:06] really pay careful attention we have so
[48:09] much to be thankful about and in the in
[48:12] the spiritual said remember we live by
[48:15] dead substance it says that if you have
[48:17] a life today somebody died for you
[48:20] somebody sacrificed for you somebody had
[48:23] to lay down the life so you could have
[48:26] life so just like in the natural
[48:28] somebody sacrifice so you could be here
[48:30] your parents they pay for your education
[48:33] or they pay for training or way for you
[48:35] to get a job somebody stepped in for you
[48:37] to have the car you have or whatever it
[48:39] is just understand that spiritually
[48:42] speaking you are sitting here not
[48:44] because of your own effort but somebody
[48:47] has been looking out for you oh we often
[48:50] time look for God and we say where is
[48:52] God where is God he's been walking along
[48:54] the way with you and you haven't even
[48:56] recognize him he's been there all the
[48:59] time and working out situations and
[49:02] healing you and walking with you and yet
[49:05] we are knocking doors and looking for
[49:07] him as yet is standing right by your
[49:09] side working every day and that's what I
[49:12] want us to just be uh mindful of is the
[49:15] Lord has never forgotten us has never
[49:18] for uh uh forsaken us he's always been
[49:20] there every time walking
[49:23] along it is spoken even on the message
[49:26] but will speak this message of
[49:28] Thanksgiving and he will quote out and
[49:30] he will say speak about the pilgrim
[49:33] forefathers and it said this history
[49:35] says that the pilgrim forefather are
[49:38] commonly associated with the first
[49:39] celebration of uh of Thanksgiving uh in
[49:43] America it says which was placed it was
[49:46] the first one was in uh
[49:48] 1621 uh 1621 and there was a group of
[49:51] English settlers who had journeyed to
[49:54] the new uh to the new world abro the
[49:57] Mayflower in search for Religious
[50:00] Freedom uh they didn't uh leave the land
[50:04] because they wanted more money they
[50:05] didn't leave because they needed more
[50:08] goods and more all all it that they
[50:11] wanted within their heart was to worship
[50:14] God the way that God was moving in their
[50:16] heart and I thought that's the heart of
[50:19] a True Believer we don't seek things
[50:21] because we want more money we want more
[50:23] this more all of it we want in life is
[50:26] to worship God in Freedom all is it that
[50:30] really bits within our heart is I don't
[50:32] care if it's about the job or this and
[50:34] this at the end of the day my decision
[50:36] is made because I want to get to a place
[50:39] where I can Worship the Lord in Freedom
[50:42] so they went to and then it says the
[50:44] pilgrims SE the the celebrated the first
[50:46] Thanksgiving after a successful Harvest
[50:49] as uh uh Plymouth massachusett and it
[50:52] says uh and the feast was a share with
[50:55] uh uh uh
[50:57] uh I looked it out but I forgot it was
[51:00] the Native American it's a tribe I for I
[51:02] can't say the name it says who helped
[51:04] them uh uh survive the first uh harsh
[51:07] winter because everything that they had
[51:10] brought just spoiled it when they get
[51:12] there they couldn't uh uh they didn't
[51:14] have anything they lost half of what
[51:16] they had so and then he says that the
[51:18] pilgrim they had a religious devotion
[51:21] the pilgrim were devout Christians they
[51:24] celebrate the celebration of
[51:26] Thanksgiving was deeply spiritual for
[51:28] them Thanksgiving was uh uh primarily
[51:32] about giving thanks to God for his
[51:35] provision or rather than a a national
[51:38] cultural celebration their Thanksgiving
[51:41] was marked by prayer worship and focus
[51:44] on God's blessing and
[51:49] faithfulness and I want to say this
[51:51] that's why when when we we can't
[51:53] celebrate Thanksgiving like the others
[51:55] are doing it we we have it's not about
[51:59] uh eating another way that you can cook
[52:01] your turkey you know I I don't know
[52:03] after 30 years how what's the other way
[52:05] that you can really cook the turkey
[52:07] there's only so many ways you can cook
[52:09] it you know what I mean you want it
[52:11] smoked you want it dipped in water brain
[52:14] you want it this you want it this that's
[52:16] never going to help you what we need is
[52:19] to come in recognition of what is God is
[52:21] doing spiritually is a Thanksgiving of
[52:25] what is it that we we as Christians how
[52:27] to be thankful about what is it as
[52:30] you're sitting here this morning what is
[52:32] it that you are really thankful about if
[52:34] you can really come in recognition of
[52:37] what's happening out there you'll be the
[52:39] most thankful person there on the face
[52:41] of the Earth if you can really come in
[52:43] realization that the world is falling
[52:45] apart if you can really come in
[52:48] recognition that there's nothing good
[52:50] out there if you can really come in
[52:53] understanding that the world is falling
[52:55] apart as fast as it can that I'm here
[52:58] Lord has open up my eyes so I can
[53:00] receive him and be saved from the
[53:02] destruction that has to make you the
[53:04] most helpful person there
[53:07] is it says and and and and the prophet
[53:10] will will and and and the prophet will
[53:13] speak here he uh uh and he will say he
[53:18] will say oh in the message I believe
[53:21] it's the same message I just quoted the
[53:23] invisible Union said I'm thankful to God
[53:26] to be living in the time on the closing
[53:29] scene of the world's
[53:32] history if you can put it up there it
[53:35] says I don't know it says if I would if
[53:38] I would have if if I would have a day uh
[53:42] say so before the foundation of the
[53:44] world and God would have laid out the
[53:47] whole program to me and said to me I
[53:50] want you to preach it says now what age
[53:54] would you desire to go on Earth and to
[53:56] preach preach it says I would choose
[53:58] this age for this is the Golden Age now
[54:03] it's amazing because if you go out there
[54:05] on the news they're saying that this is
[54:07] the Golden
[54:11] Age on the news today after the election
[54:15] they're calling this the golden age but
[54:17] yes's a prophet here already speaking
[54:20] about it if you go on the news you hear
[54:22] them talk about cat ladies and dog
[54:24] ladies the prophet has said it in this
[54:28] message is it a coincidence no if if we
[54:32] are not careful we get caught up in the
[54:35] intellect and this and this God is
[54:37] continually speaking his word to us
[54:40] every day it doesn't matter where you
[54:42] are let me say this God is speaking the
[54:46] question is are you listening because
[54:48] God is speaking he doesn't want you to
[54:50] get caught up in the political and the
[54:53] things that are were happening he wants
[54:55] you when you see the Pol iCal to go
[54:57] right back into his word and say that
[54:59] what is it that you're saying to me what
[55:02] time what Junction of time am I living
[55:04] in so I can hear your word and know what
[55:06] you're saying to me so he's saying that
[55:09] I want to live in this age because this
[55:11] is the Golden Age I certainly would have
[55:13] loved to have been here during the time
[55:16] of his visit to the Earth but still I
[55:19] think this right now is the greatest
[55:22] time because it's time that is coming to
[55:25] take the people that is redeemed near
[55:28] nearing the resurrection when all the
[55:31] redeemed will come forth what a
[55:33] religious what a what a glorious
[55:36] opportunity we have to speak to the
[55:38] dying people great time we are unused
[55:42] about
[55:44] it it it let me say this everything that
[55:47] Jesus died for is culminating at the
[55:50] time that we are sitting here this
[55:52] morning this is the greatest time that
[55:54] is ever being what men Lost In the
[55:57] Garden of Eden God has restored what was
[55:59] in the beginning is here today the same
[56:02] voice of Resurrection the same voice
[56:05] that said let there be at in the
[56:06] beginning the same voice that look at
[56:09] Lazarus and say come forth the same
[56:11] voice has spoken to you in this end time
[56:14] not a different voice the same voice the
[56:17] same God with all his power and might
[56:19] and everything that he
[56:22] is God didn't want us to have a
[56:25] substitute God didn't want us to have a
[56:27] substandard message where we say well
[56:30] God spoke but that was just in that time
[56:32] oh God spoke but he was in the time of
[56:34] Jesus Christ he said that what he did
[56:37] with the Jews God promised that the
[56:39] Gentile will receive the same thing and
[56:42] he didn't send it in the first age not
[56:44] in the second age not in the third age
[56:46] he waited until you were here and he
[56:49] spoke so you can hear
[56:55] it let's not like brother uh uhh Paul
[56:58] was saying let's not be like that man
[57:01] that grew up at the ocean I get used to
[57:03] it no this is the Glorious age that's
[57:06] ever
[57:07] been this is the time that we have to be
[57:11] assured and know that I'm a Son of God
[57:13] because the word of God said so I me I
[57:16] heard the same voice of the Resurrection
[57:18] that spoke in the day of Lazarus I heard
[57:21] the same voice I said let there be I
[57:24] heard it with my own ears amen yes
[57:29] sir yet the devil is always there to try
[57:33] to make us stand and go if I could only
[57:35] have been in the time of Jesus
[57:40] on but about ask he says who's
[57:45] Jesus we we say Jesus and people
[57:49] automatically they have a 33y old man
[57:52] that's in a robe walking and touching
[57:55] people in say that Jesus the prophet
[57:58] said that if you meet someone with scars
[58:00] in his hand claiming to be Jesus he says
[58:03] that's an impostor Jesus Christ is the
[58:05] revealed word of the hour who was he he
[58:09] was the word of God reveal in that time
[58:11] and today is the same why because it's
[58:14] the revealed word for the time that you
[58:16] are living in remember it's never by
[58:20] sight it's never by what your eyes can
[58:22] see it's by Revelation those that knew
[58:25] him they knew knew him by Revelation and
[58:27] my brother my sister aren't you glad you
[58:29] know him by Revelation this
[58:33] morning that's right he he looked at
[58:36] Peter and said who do men say that I am
[58:38] he said well some say you are this why
[58:41] they were going by side oh some say you
[58:43] are this Prophet that a prophet they
[58:45] said but he said who do you say that I
[58:47] am he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[58:50] of the Living God in other words you are
[58:52] the anointed one for the hour and the
[58:55] prophet comes in this end time he said
[58:57] you are the anointed one for this
[59:03] hour that's what you have received and
[59:06] let me say this you didn't receive that
[59:08] so you can keep it in a closet you
[59:10] didn't receive that so you can keep it
[59:12] in the book you received it so you can
[59:15] walk out there and say I am the Son of
[59:18] [Music]
[59:23] God we dying with a very p in our
[59:31] hands

[59:56] closing out the world the world's
[59:59] history soon be over will soon be

[1:00:07] new
[1:00:08] day to the great
[1:00:11] Millennium that as a Believer as as one

[1:00:28] take a physical people glor
[1:00:32] glorified by his cleansing
[1:00:35] blood I I tell you this th this is not
[1:00:38] time for
[1:00:39] compromising it it's not time to be
[1:00:41] looking out and trying to figure things
[1:00:43] out it's the time to dig into the word
[1:00:47] and be conscious of what we have
[1:00:49] received and let the word of God change
[1:00:51] your life for what God wants you to be
[1:00:54] this message didn't come so we can just
[1:00:56] quote it this message came with a power
[1:00:59] of transformation to make us into what
[1:01:02] God wants us to be and I want to say
[1:01:04] that let's not fall short and I know we
[1:01:06] know all this quotes we can read them we
[1:01:08] know all of this things but I just want
[1:01:11] us to understand this morning what is it
[1:01:13] that we are thankful for and let that
[1:01:16] that that which we are thankful for take
[1:01:18] an effect on us let it have an effect on
[1:01:21] us until we can produce the thing that
[1:01:24] he said that we should be promised
[1:01:27] and and he said this the scripture will
[1:01:29] say this in Deuteronomy 8 And1 it says
[1:01:32] oh
[1:01:34] beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
[1:01:40] God it says in not keeping his
[1:01:43] commandment and his judgment for his
[1:01:46] statue which I commanded thee this day
[1:01:49] it says let that thou lest when thou has
[1:01:54] eaten
[1:01:56] and are and are full and has build
[1:02:00] goodly houses and dwell wherein and when
[1:02:04] thy herd and thy flock
[1:02:06] multiply that silver and gold is
[1:02:09] multiply and all that has is
[1:02:12] multiply then thy heart be lifted up and
[1:02:16] thou forget the Lord thy
[1:02:21] God don't don't be be caught up in
[1:02:24] riches and don't caught up oh because I
[1:02:27] can do this I have this I have this the
[1:02:29] the word of God is a constant warning to
[1:02:31] us it says don't be forgetful for the
[1:02:34] time that you are living in don't be
[1:02:36] forgetful of how you got here don't be
[1:02:39] forgetful of the work that the Lord is
[1:02:41] doing what the devil wants you always to
[1:02:44] do is always to concentrate in your
[1:02:47] inability in what you are trying to
[1:02:50] achieve and blur the whole program of
[1:02:52] God in front of you so you don't have
[1:02:54] the clear picture what the word is
[1:02:56] telling you is you didn't save yourself
[1:02:59] you didn't heal yourself you didn't make
[1:03:01] yourself what you are the one who
[1:03:04] brought you here is the one who's going
[1:03:05] to take you to the finish
[1:03:08] line Thank You
[1:03:10] Lord look the word of God is saying I
[1:03:13] it's him who starts the work is him who
[1:03:15] will finish it so don't jump the process
[1:03:19] if you have a need of something there's
[1:03:21] a word made available for you to take
[1:03:24] the word and overcome with it it's not
[1:03:26] for you to say oh I need this I need to
[1:03:29] go find this somewhere else did you get
[1:03:31] to where you were by
[1:03:33] yourself it it's the word providing a
[1:03:36] way for you to come out of what you are
[1:03:39] into what God wants you to
[1:03:41] be he says may I say this paragraph 192
[1:03:45] it says what it says what this all's got
[1:03:49] to do with Thanksgiving it says what are
[1:03:51] you think what are you talking about
[1:03:53] brother brandham he says here it is
[1:03:55] quarter to9 I didn't say nothing about
[1:03:58] Thanksgiving what a message for the
[1:04:00] occasion yes it says the pilgrim for
[1:04:04] father we're very thankful for the new
[1:04:06] found way of
[1:04:09] life being separated from the old
[1:04:12] English denomination and Creed they
[1:04:15] could marry to a new anointed word for
[1:04:19] the rage and he says that's right the
[1:04:23] new anointed word for the age for the
[1:04:28] for their AG for their age so they
[1:04:30] receive what they were thankful about
[1:04:33] was they were not caught within that
[1:04:36] same old religion and and the same old
[1:04:38] things that never produce anything
[1:04:40] imagine going to church day in and day
[1:04:43] out and never get to receive anything
[1:04:45] imagine going to church day in and day
[1:04:48] out they preach you they preach you
[1:04:50] about Sin today they preach you about
[1:04:52] baptism tomorrow and the next day you
[1:04:54] come back to preach about
[1:04:56] again just imagine that's what's
[1:04:59] happening out there it's constantly oh
[1:05:01] you got to do this it's a 10 step to
[1:05:04] this you are not good enough and you are
[1:05:06] this and you got to work enough you got
[1:05:08] to work a lot more you you got to
[1:05:10] sacrifice this you got to do this you
[1:05:11] got to do this constantly under trying
[1:05:15] to figure out a way that you can please
[1:05:17] God imagine because that's what the old
[1:05:20] denomination is all about it's a process
[1:05:22] that's set up to just keep you turning
[1:05:25] in circles and never getting to anywhere
[1:05:28] imagine that but oh aren't you thankful
[1:05:30] you have received a message that's come
[1:05:32] when the world looks at you and call you
[1:05:35] a sinner the word of God calls you a Son
[1:05:37] of
[1:05:40] God when the world looks at you and they
[1:05:43] look at you you think you're crazy when
[1:05:46] this word of God looked at you in the
[1:05:48] situation that you were not now in the
[1:05:51] situation that you were in sin he looked
[1:05:54] at you and they called you a Son of God
[1:05:56] thank you Lord it said you are a son
[1:05:59] that's why you are not happy in the
[1:06:00] situation that you are in just come
[1:06:03] out you believe the word and you started
[1:06:06] coming out you believe the word that's
[1:06:09] why you are sitting here this morning
[1:06:11] let me say this this morning you
[1:06:13] probably have more faith than you think
[1:06:15] you have the reason is you let the
[1:06:17] knowledge in the things of the world
[1:06:19] fill your mind that's why you are
[1:06:21] struggling but if you let the same faith
[1:06:23] that got you out of the world the same
[1:06:25] faith that stop the things of the world
[1:06:28] that's God that's the faith that God
[1:06:29] wants to build
[1:06:33] upon we we start off by faith but then
[1:06:36] we try to add education on
[1:06:45] top I want to say
[1:06:50] this I'm thankful to be separated this
[1:06:53] morning amen

[1:06:59] thankful I I
[1:07:01] know we we we we are all a work in
[1:07:05] progress but I'm
[1:07:07] thankful that I can see the deception
[1:07:09] that's out there amen I'm thankful that
[1:07:12] God has opened up my eyes and has placed
[1:07:15] a desire in my heart that on the Sunday
[1:07:18] morning I should be in his house I'm
[1:07:22] thankful that I'm sitting here with
[1:07:24] those of light precious faith those who
[1:07:27] have been called out and we are here
[1:07:30] together worshiping the Lord I'm

[1:07:41] 10:7 I'm thankful for the revealing of
[1:07:44] the son of man I'm thankful that God in
[1:07:47] this generation has made himself known
[1:07:50] to me personally I looked at it I saw
[1:07:54] the message as saw a man talking some
[1:07:57] looked at him and just call him a boy
[1:07:59] from Kentucky who couldn't put the
[1:08:01] sentence together but I listen to him I
[1:08:04] heard God talking I heard God calling
[1:08:07] I'm thankful this morning that when he
[1:08:09] stood there and you turn his back and he
[1:08:11] said you that are sitting over there and
[1:08:14] so and so they said God has healed you
[1:08:16] I'm thankful that somebody looked at it
[1:08:18] they said is reading the mind but I
[1:08:21] looked at it I said that's God that's
[1:08:23] the same hello him who stood before
[1:08:25] Abraham and I can stand here this
[1:08:28] morning and say that this scripture is
[1:08:30] fulfilled before your very

[1:08:51] the seals why because he said within
[1:08:54] those divine revealing mystery he's
[1:08:57] quickening to you the faith for the
[1:08:58] Rapture in other word he's come to take
[1:09:01] you home he's here revealing himself to
[1:09:04] you so you can receive that word and be
[1:09:07] taken out of here let me say this don't
[1:09:09] lose focus of the
[1:09:15] purpose the word of God will not be a
[1:09:18] success if you're trying to apply it for
[1:09:21] the things of the world
[1:09:25] it's given to you to get you ready so
[1:09:28] you could be taken out here that's why I
[1:09:31] love what our Pastor said this is not a
[1:09:33] staying message it's a living message
[1:09:36] this message it's not about how much
[1:09:38] rich I can get in this world it's how
[1:09:41] quickly I can get out of
[1:09:46] here we can stand here this morning and
[1:09:49] say that I have heard God God spoke in
[1:09:52] this generation and be on the word of
[1:09:58] God the prophet will speak and he will
[1:10:03] say paragraph 20 195 it
[1:10:07] says Pentecost dried
[1:10:10] up like Luther and Wesley and the rest
[1:10:13] of
[1:10:15] them it's no more than a bunch of
[1:10:17] churches pulling
[1:10:19] together said God's people in
[1:10:22] there yet has got to to come out to be
[1:10:26] out to be come
[1:10:28] out it says what did he do he opened up
[1:10:33] the Seven
[1:10:34] Seals of the last message yes sir notice
[1:10:39] that you notice that Seven Seals which
[1:10:43] all the mysteries of the seven churches
[1:10:45] were sealed with Seven Seals the
[1:10:47] reformers didn't have time to do it in
[1:10:50] their days they didn't have they didn't
[1:10:52] live long enough it says but this
[1:10:55] blessed revelation of the seven seal
[1:10:58] it's opened to us in the last days from
[1:11:02] a prophecy from a prophecy that went
[1:11:04] forth to
[1:11:06] Arizona he
[1:11:08] says we have
[1:11:12] been and and I want to say this this has
[1:11:16] been given to us is so that we could be
[1:11:19] ready for what God has calling us to do
[1:11:24] this message is been given to us in
[1:11:27] order to get us ready first of all it's
[1:11:29] been given us to change us it's given us
[1:11:33] so we can get away from our thinking and
[1:11:37] our constant looking at ourselves and
[1:11:39] our failures and and constantly looking
[1:11:42] oh I'm not good enough and I can't do
[1:11:44] this I can't do that it's it's primarily
[1:11:47] sent so we can come in recognition and
[1:11:50] say that God is coming because remember
[1:11:53] it's in this message that is revealing
[1:11:55] your true origin he's letting you know
[1:11:57] where you really come from he's wanting
[1:12:00] to let you know that your origin is not
[1:12:02] your birth how you came from your
[1:12:04] parents and everything but your origin
[1:12:06] was that you were in God's mind before
[1:12:08] the foundation of the world but why is
[1:12:11] he telling you that he's giving you the
[1:12:13] word so you can be Overcomer in the
[1:12:16] generation that you are living
[1:12:18] in he giving you what you have need of
[1:12:21] in order for you to overcome the
[1:12:23] challenges you're facing he's giving you
[1:12:26] the world so you can stand toet to Toe
[1:12:28] with the devil it doesn't matter if it's
[1:12:31] in the form of sickness it doesn't
[1:12:33] matter it's in the form of depression it
[1:12:35] doesn't matter if it's a form of sin
[1:12:38] whatever form the devil shows up this
[1:12:40] morning God has given us the power and
[1:12:43] the authority to send there and bring
[1:12:45] forth the word of God and overcome
[1:12:51] him it it it's not given so we could
[1:12:54] just read
[1:12:55] now I I tell you I don't know about you
[1:12:57] but I like to see the word in action I I
[1:13:00] I don't know about you I I I I told the
[1:13:03] brothers I said I don't want to say if
[1:13:05] the message is true but I know it's true
[1:13:08] I want to see it in action I I I want to
[1:13:10] see it in AC I want to see the
[1:13:13] transformation working in our
[1:13:16] midst I want to see God's purpose being
[1:13:19] fulfilled it's not given so we can just
[1:13:22] take it and read it for one another all
[1:13:24] that no when one is sick we hear one is
[1:13:27] sick it's given to I can send there say
[1:13:29] it's by your stripes that th sisters
[1:13:32] heal and see stand
[1:13:36] up it's given when you meet one that's
[1:13:39] not saved you can speak to them remember
[1:13:42] says that this generation that they it
[1:13:45] says that the world will not see me no
[1:13:47] more but ye shall see me and the prophet
[1:13:50] will use that to say that this
[1:13:52] generation that the only form of Jesus
[1:13:54] Christ that they will ever see will be
[1:13:56] through
[1:13:58] you the only form that Jesus Christ let
[1:14:02] me say this you you you couldn't show me
[1:14:05] a promise in the Bible that it said that
[1:14:08] Jesus Christ will come and with the
[1:14:10] flesh that he had 2,000 years ago that
[1:14:13] he will walk again on the streets people
[1:14:16] will see him no they coming at the end
[1:14:19] time the form that it choose to be is
[1:14:21] your form is your flesh is your body
[1:14:25] so remember he says the work that I do
[1:14:28] ye shall do also
[1:14:33] when it said I'm going to the father but
[1:14:36] that's not the end of it I'll come again
[1:14:38] what did he go to do at the father he
[1:14:40] went and he took the book of
[1:14:42] redemption after he already paid the
[1:14:45] price he took the book the book that was
[1:14:48] taken away from you he went and he took
[1:14:50] the book and in Revelation 10:7 it came
[1:14:54] down and he handed you back to PO so
[1:14:57] that the works that he did you can do
[1:15:03] also the same
[1:15:06] Jesus otherwise he not the same
[1:15:09] yesterday today and forever it's the
[1:15:12] same so we would see Jesus those that
[1:15:15] saw him it's not because they recognize
[1:15:18] him for the flesh that he was in it's
[1:15:21] because they recognized him for the word
[1:15:23] that he was being revealed
[1:15:32] into the scripture will say in Matthew
[1:15:34] 13 and6 it says but blessed are your
[1:15:38] eyes for their
[1:15:40] sea and your ears for to hear for verily
[1:15:44] I say unto you that many prophets and
[1:15:47] righteous men have desired to see him to
[1:15:50] see those things which ye see and then
[1:15:54] have not seen them
[1:15:55] and to hear those those things which ye
[1:15:57] hear but have not heard
[1:16:01] them it says in Luke 10 and 23 it
[1:16:06] says and he turned unto his disciple and
[1:16:10] he says he said privately blessed are
[1:16:13] your eyes which see the things ye
[1:16:17] see for I tell you that many prophets
[1:16:20] and Kings have desire to see those
[1:16:23] things which he see and have not seen
[1:16:26] them and have heard and to hear the
[1:16:28] things which he hear and have not heard
[1:16:32] them in 2 Corinthians 4 and6 it says for
[1:16:37] God who commanded the light to shine out
[1:16:40] of
[1:16:40] Darkness had had shine in our hearts to
[1:16:45] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:16:48] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:16:55] it's not by our own self he he
[1:17:01] chose to open up your eyes and our
[1:17:05] understanding so we can see him for who
[1:17:08] he is he chose for us to for our eyes to
[1:17:13] be open for the opportunity to be given
[1:17:16] to us so we can hear this message so we
[1:17:18] can know this message and with with
[1:17:21] knowing it with hearing it he has also
[1:17:25] given not just the form of understanding
[1:17:28] but he's given the power of
[1:17:30] transformation so we can become what the
[1:17:33] message says we
[1:17:36] are with that he's given the authority
[1:17:39] that we can stand here this morning and
[1:17:41] say that what that message what the
[1:17:44] prophet said we are I am this morning
[1:17:47] what the prophet proclaimed that I will
[1:17:49] be I am today because remember but when
[1:17:53] I'm will say this I don't have the rept
[1:17:55] with me he says how did Jesus come he
[1:17:58] said that Jesus came by the words of the
[1:18:01] Prophet prophet Isaiah said a virgin
[1:18:04] shall conceive and and the word of God
[1:18:07] was hanging out there until there was a
[1:18:09] virgin found called Mary the word of God
[1:18:12] that was hanging for hundreds of years
[1:18:15] came from what it was that Isaiah spoke
[1:18:18] many people between the time that Isaiah
[1:18:20] spoke until the time of Mary they looked
[1:18:23] at it and they thought that probably was
[1:18:25] the craziest chapter in the
[1:18:27] Bible some looked at him and and like
[1:18:30] but Paul was saying they thought oh it's
[1:18:32] my daughter it's this it there so much
[1:18:34] happened but God knew the time and the
[1:18:37] person that was going to fulfill that
[1:18:39] prophecy and one day that prophecy came
[1:18:42] to pass and then that prophecy came to
[1:18:44] pass butam says that how was he
[1:18:47] identified it says one Prophet spoke
[1:18:50] about it and another Prophet looked at
[1:18:52] him and saids Behold the Lamb of God
[1:18:54] takes away the sin of the world so one
[1:18:57] Prophet talked about it another Prophet
[1:19:00] came and confirmed that today the
[1:19:02] scriptures fulfilled and let me say as
[1:19:04] they ask a question how is the bride
[1:19:07] going to come there will be another
[1:19:09] prophet in Malachi 4 who will speak
[1:19:11] about the bride that will come and at
[1:19:13] the end time where are we he came and he
[1:19:16] prophesied how that the bride will come
[1:19:19] and she will be born of his born and she
[1:19:21] will be power of his power the those
[1:19:24] same works that Christ did she will do
[1:19:28] also and that same prophets came and he
[1:19:32] said you are the thoughts of God
[1:19:36] manifested for this
[1:19:40] time now what did Mary do to Merit that
[1:19:45] nothing what did you do to Merit this
[1:19:49] nothing but what did Mary do be unto be
[1:19:53] according to th word
[1:19:55] I I don't know how I'm going to be
[1:19:56] pregnant with a child when I don't know
[1:19:58] no man that exceeds my understanding how
[1:20:02] is it that I'm going to be pregnant with
[1:20:04] a baby and have a child how is it that
[1:20:06] I'm going to go in the Rapture how is it
[1:20:08] that I'm going to have a body change I
[1:20:10] don't know how to explain how is it that
[1:20:13] I'm going to overcome all the challenges
[1:20:14] I see in front of me I don't know but
[1:20:17] one thing I know is you have spoken and
[1:20:19] you have the power to bring it to pass
[1:20:21] all I say Let It Be unto me according to
[1:20:24] the word my brother my sister we are not
[1:20:27] the one bringing the word he's bringing
[1:20:29] his word to come to
[1:20:32] pass God is looking for a willing vessel
[1:20:36] someone crazy enough to believe the
[1:20:38] impossible someone crazy enough to stand
[1:20:41] and say I believe the word of God I'll
[1:20:44] be I believe there'll be a Rapture and
[1:20:46] God looks at him and says I will
[1:20:48] vindicate the
[1:20:52] crazy the problem is we we like to
[1:20:55] filter everything through our human
[1:20:58] understanding is it making sense really
[1:21:01] if it makes sense we are all for it if
[1:21:04] it's crazy I don't know I we we remember
[1:21:09] we we like to see it happen before and
[1:21:11] then we believe no Mary believed the
[1:21:16] impossible but when I'm said she didn't
[1:21:19] have a reference in the Bible that she
[1:21:22] could go and say that oh I know of
[1:21:25] someone who conceive without knowing a
[1:21:27] Man Zero but the same God who spoke it
[1:21:32] was the same God who was able to bring
[1:21:33] it to pass my brother my sister your
[1:21:36] body change is going to come the same
[1:21:38] way the same God who spoke it the same
[1:21:41] God will come to bring it to
[1:21:44] pass hallelujah what are we afraid of we
[1:21:48] we we we serve the almighty God the
[1:21:51] creator of Heaven and Earth we heard it
[1:21:52] through our meeting he's a unlimited God
[1:21:56] he's the one who does
[1:22:00] everything are we afraid of what people
[1:22:03] are going to think of
[1:22:06] us let me tell you they already think
[1:22:08] you're
[1:22:12] crazy I might as well continue in the
[1:22:18] crazy Noah was taught crazy tell me one
[1:22:22] that never was taught to be crazy Simeon
[1:22:25] will start crazy your age you're going
[1:22:28] to see the coming of the Lord every day
[1:22:30] the scripture says he came in the temple
[1:22:32] praise God today is the day praise God
[1:22:36] today is the day today praise God I got
[1:22:39] a revelation that I shall not die until
[1:22:42] I see the coming of the Lord praise God
[1:22:44] he kept testifying every day of the
[1:22:46] crazy and one day a baby was brought
[1:22:49] into the temple what what says when that
[1:22:52] baby when they brought that baby she
[1:22:54] didn't look anything like what would
[1:22:56] happen in fact she didn't have the great
[1:22:58] clothes or or great ceremony he was
[1:23:01] wiping to swatling cloth and perhaps it
[1:23:04] look like a homeless and it looked like
[1:23:06] nothing but what was it it was the
[1:23:08] Fulfillment of the
[1:23:13] prophecy we were fellowshipping with the
[1:23:15] brothers the other day I said you can
[1:23:17] take this Bible and line up every single
[1:23:21] prophecy and every single time that God
[1:23:23] has fulfilled filed it and say that I
[1:23:26] know exactly how it's going to come and
[1:23:29] when he shows up it's going to be not
[1:23:32] according to anything you were thinking
[1:23:34] but yet it will be according to the
[1:23:39] scriptures he wants you to know that
[1:23:41] he's God he doesn't want you to mix him
[1:23:44] with everything else he wants you to
[1:23:46] know that he's a unique God he's the god
[1:23:49] of the impossible when he steps into a
[1:23:51] situation no matter how hard the
[1:23:53] situation is is he wants you at the end
[1:23:55] of your situation to know that I have
[1:23:58] made the god of the
[1:24:00] impossible the doctor look I said oh it
[1:24:04] looks like you have a problem you know
[1:24:06] it looks like with what you have based
[1:24:09] on the history that we have based on the
[1:24:12] data that we've gathered this is going
[1:24:14] to take six months for you to be well
[1:24:16] they come back the next day you walk and
[1:24:18] they said what happened he says well
[1:24:20] perhaps we miscalculated no the god of
[1:24:23] the impossible step
[1:24:36] oh if only Tom could stand
[1:24:47] still the prophet will say
[1:24:55] it speaks about the scripture we read in
[1:25:01] Romans it says trusting you have your
[1:25:03] Bible open and everyone and across the
[1:25:05] country we want to read and and uh read
[1:25:09] closely now it says now our message
[1:25:12] is is is a message out there of here it
[1:25:16] says it seems like it's about marriage
[1:25:18] and divorce but it's really to me it it
[1:25:21] calls it it's the prophecy of the church
[1:25:25] in the last
[1:25:30] day he's and let me say this the the
[1:25:33] word of God is always a
[1:25:37] prophecy the the word of God is what
[1:25:40] tells you of what you're going to be
[1:25:42] before you even
[1:25:44] are the the word of God because remember
[1:25:47] if the word is not spoken then what what
[1:25:50] what's the expectation of being that but
[1:25:53] the word of God goes before you to
[1:25:56] prepare the way so you can obtain what
[1:25:58] God is calling you to be so what he's
[1:26:00] saying is that this is the prophecy of
[1:26:02] the church in the end time so he's
[1:26:05] prophesying of a condition in the people
[1:26:08] that are going to be called an elected
[1:26:10] people a people that will be taken out
[1:26:13] of the world and the things of the world
[1:26:15] and they are called to manifest Christ
[1:26:17] like nobody before they are called to be
[1:26:20] the culmination of the ministry of what
[1:26:23] God has been working from from the
[1:26:24] beginning of time so now he saying but
[1:26:27] this is a prophecy I want you when you
[1:26:29] hear the word of God say that this is a
[1:26:31] prophecy to me when I hear the message
[1:26:34] of God being spoken when I hear the
[1:26:36] prophet speaking and if I feel I'm
[1:26:38] falling short all I need to know this is
[1:26:40] a prophecy to me why because God doesn't
[1:26:43] speak unless he has the power to bring
[1:26:45] you to pass God doesn't speak unless the
[1:26:48] word can fulfill what he spoke for so
[1:26:51] when he's speaking he's wanting us to
[1:26:53] take it and know that this is a prophecy
[1:26:56] to me so when he's speaking here he's
[1:26:58] saying that that there would be an
[1:26:59] elected people on Earth that that in
[1:27:02] this age that would receive the word of
[1:27:04] God for their age and God pattern will
[1:27:07] never be changed and is the same
[1:27:08] yesterday today and forever and the
[1:27:10] prophecy is calling this and saying that
[1:27:13] this is an illustration of what the time
[1:27:16] that we are living in and is warning us
[1:27:19] about
[1:27:20] something he he's here saying because I
[1:27:23] and and he says here if I could just
[1:27:25] read it for the sake of time paragraph
[1:27:28] uh 35 he says now Paul here is giving an
[1:27:31] illustration uh in our scripture about
[1:27:34] the law of of of about the law and Grace
[1:27:37] an illustration it uh it's like marriage
[1:27:40] and divorce the passage is very seldom
[1:27:43] preached on because it's more or less uh
[1:27:46] pertain to like marriage and divorce but
[1:27:49] it's also pertaining to the greater
[1:27:51] portion of marriage and divorce it says
[1:27:53] un how we are trying how he trying to
[1:27:57] set in order here it says we as a church
[1:28:02] can no more be married to the world and
[1:28:04] to Christ and at the same time and be
[1:28:08] legal and lawful about it then it could
[1:28:11] be uh it could be for a woman then it
[1:28:14] can be for a woman to be uh living with
[1:28:17] a husband while she's got a living
[1:28:19] husband and I have my own thoughts on
[1:28:22] that and I believe that
[1:28:24] uh what the Bible says is true so he's
[1:28:27] bringing us here in remembrance of
[1:28:30] something and I I I know I I've already
[1:28:32] run out of time I'm not going to finish
[1:28:34] but let me just say this so he's wanting
[1:28:36] us to be really careful and and and and
[1:28:39] come through this greater understanding
[1:28:41] that we we cannot uh believe the things
[1:28:45] that we just talked about and still work
[1:28:49] and function and and still bu be married
[1:28:52] to the world
[1:28:54] that that the the hindrance here is not
[1:28:57] that the world has not the word of God
[1:29:00] has not spoken about you being
[1:29:02] Christlike it's not that God has spoken
[1:29:04] to you and say that you are just like me
[1:29:07] but it does it wants you not to be
[1:29:09] caught into the things of the world God
[1:29:12] wants the word that you have heard he
[1:29:14] wants you to act by it to walk by it to
[1:29:18] feed by it to do everything so it can
[1:29:21] become effective in your life
[1:29:24] that that that the what what Satan the
[1:29:27] the best thing that he's always done
[1:29:29] with our life is to always get get us
[1:29:32] caught between two opinions and oh I
[1:29:35] have the Flesh and but I have this and
[1:29:37] the word said I'm this but I got to work
[1:29:39] and and I have a job I got to feed my
[1:29:41] family and then you always get to fight
[1:29:44] between the two and and you don't know
[1:29:46] what to do and today you act like a Son
[1:29:48] of God tomorrow you act like a a sinner
[1:29:51] tomorrow you do this and and then being
[1:29:54] CL between the two can never bring you
[1:29:56] to the Perfection of what God wants you
[1:29:58] to to be what God is saying is saying
[1:30:01] I'm speaking my word to you I want you
[1:30:04] to fully consider and walk in the word
[1:30:07] that I have given you for it to be
[1:30:09] effective in your
[1:30:13] life you see that let me say this God
[1:30:17] knows we have builds to pay God knows we
[1:30:20] have challenges God knows all of that
[1:30:22] and I believe if we fully take his word
[1:30:25] his word will produce everything that we
[1:30:28] have need
[1:30:30] of you know the the devil is breaking up
[1:30:33] this dance and a church where you you
[1:30:36] say you believe the message but he wants
[1:30:38] you to just be around the message right
[1:30:41] you know as long as I can dress right
[1:30:43] and as long as I can I can talk right as
[1:30:46] long as no the message is for more than
[1:30:48] that the message is to change the Inner
[1:30:52] Man and produce the character of Christ
[1:30:54] out of you that's
[1:30:57] right you know as long as I know God
[1:31:00] sent a message well it's not good enough
[1:31:02] to just know that God sent a message is
[1:31:05] to know that that message is for you and
[1:31:07] to change
[1:31:12] you you see so it's not it's not going
[1:31:16] to stop you I if it's just an
[1:31:19] intellectual approach and an
[1:31:22] intellectual Gathering intellectual uh
[1:31:25] uh understanding of what the whole thing
[1:31:27] is all about but what is what he doesn't
[1:31:30] want you to do is to die to yourself and
[1:31:33] fully be committed to
[1:31:37] it he doesn't want you to get to a place
[1:31:40] where he said I Lay My Life down I'm
[1:31:43] dying to myself I'm going to take the
[1:31:45] word of God no matter what he doesn't
[1:31:47] want you to do that and as long as you
[1:31:50] stay in that state brother rham says you
[1:31:52] shall be called
[1:31:54] she shall be called an
[1:32:01] adulterous and let me say
[1:32:03] this but
[1:32:05] God has sent something that's greater
[1:32:08] than that the prophet will
[1:32:11] say if I could just get to it it
[1:32:15] says and today we see he's different
[1:32:19] differentiating it than calling one the
[1:32:21] church natural and the other the church
[1:32:23] spirit
[1:32:24] spiritual it says now today as we see
[1:32:27] the church natural is your intellectual
[1:32:30] gospel and going further and further
[1:32:33] away from the word in a so in in in
[1:32:36] Social Gospel and we find that the that
[1:32:39] the woman of the world and and on the
[1:32:43] streets member of such of such is
[1:32:47] carrying themselves in the same
[1:32:49] atmosphere you can't tell them they've
[1:32:52] they've lost all sense of eom
[1:32:55] deeny and the people
[1:32:59] have it says that's the word the church
[1:33:02] is has he says you you can see it going
[1:33:07] straight to the econ e EC commical
[1:33:10] Council just as certain as anything in
[1:33:13] the world and and and writing into Rome
[1:33:17] as hard as he can as he can go CZ it's
[1:33:21] prophesied and there it is
[1:33:24] that's her
[1:33:25] behavior I thought about it and because
[1:33:28] we were talking about it with the
[1:33:30] brothers you know but Paul sent me a a
[1:33:33] thing where he said that oh in Texas
[1:33:35] they decided that they're going to bring
[1:33:36] back the Bible into schools and
[1:33:39] everybody's like heyen that's
[1:33:42] wonderful my question is who's doing
[1:33:50] it the the word of God the god God is
[1:33:54] never interested in conversion by
[1:33:59] government God is not interested for us
[1:34:02] to go out there and arrest everybody and
[1:34:04] say if you don't believe a message we'll
[1:34:06] put you in jail that's right no God is
[1:34:10] is God his own chosen people God is
[1:34:13] placing the seed inside of your heart so
[1:34:16] when you hear the heart you are fully
[1:34:18] converted you are fully transformed and
[1:34:21] let me say this I'll take a transform
[1:34:23] person anytime than a person who's
[1:34:26] working by government because the hearts
[1:34:28] is not in it to begin
[1:34:32] with now it will look like it's good
[1:34:35] until they turn against
[1:34:38] you until they give the explanation of
[1:34:42] what that
[1:34:44] means you go oh no I don't believe that
[1:34:48] explanation see it God wants us to go
[1:34:52] that's why he talks about the failure of
[1:34:54] the church is that they went out there
[1:34:57] instead of preaching the gospel they
[1:34:59] were teaching the gospel oh you know you
[1:35:01] got to wear a long dress and you got to
[1:35:04] do this you got to do this then you're a
[1:35:05] message believer and somebody come
[1:35:07] dressing like that and we call him a
[1:35:09] message believer just because we can
[1:35:11] quot just because we can do that no
[1:35:13] that's not the word god called the way
[1:35:15] God called is a power of transformation
[1:35:17] in someone's heart he comes and he takes
[1:35:20] away the heart's desire for the things
[1:35:22] of the world he Chang es you and you
[1:35:24] become a fully Son of God and the
[1:35:26] daughter of
[1:35:31] God and I say this because I believe it
[1:35:34] with all my heart that that's how the
[1:35:36] gospel has always been preached from the
[1:35:38] day of Pentecost he didn't send him out
[1:35:41] there and say go teach he said go with
[1:35:43] the power of demonstration in other
[1:35:45] words you go to somebody you find them
[1:35:48] in the S you say I was a sinner that
[1:35:50] just like you are I was in the same
[1:35:52] thing that you were but God came by my
[1:35:54] way and he touched me and he changed me
[1:35:57] and that same God is here to do the same
[1:35:59] for
[1:36:00] you from Faith to Faith and the same God
[1:36:04] moves by the spoken word and he does the
[1:36:08] same to the
[1:36:10] individual today our conversion is oh
[1:36:14] I'll give you the sales book just go
[1:36:15] read it just go read
[1:36:19] it oh I read it oh I'm mean it
[1:36:24] you have to be born
[1:36:27] again that gospel is never changed you
[1:36:31] have to be born again you have to die to
[1:36:34] yourself our challenge in life is we
[1:36:37] don't die we try to conf the word of God
[1:36:41] speak and we try to find a way we can
[1:36:43] fit no what we need is a daily dying the
[1:36:47] word of God said something you said God

[1:38:24] and you know when you go out on Mission
[1:38:26] this is how you're going to get them ask
[1:38:28] them this questions and this questions
[1:38:30] if they answer this way if they ask you
[1:38:32] a question you can't answer called an
[1:38:35] elder
[1:38:38] really you are the
[1:38:41] Elder Peter stood on G beautiful and
[1:38:44] said silver and gold have none but that
[1:38:47] which I have what did he have he just
[1:38:49] came from the Pentecost he knew he had
[1:38:52] an experience what was promised he
[1:38:55] received it let me say this you don't
[1:38:57] have to have gone out in the world and
[1:38:59] done drugs to know God no you can know
[1:39:02] him today this morning he's the same
[1:39:05] yesterday whatever you're going through
[1:39:06] this morning you can know him this
[1:39:08] morning
[1:39:14] now I love that story that Ben was
[1:39:17] reading
[1:39:18] the a simple paper just a simple paper
[1:39:22] piece of paper that was folded and he
[1:39:24] opened it and
[1:39:27] said where would you go when you die
[1:39:30] what do you think about
[1:39:32] him just a simple
[1:39:34] note that's where it all
[1:39:38] started the prophet would say just to
[1:39:42] list desire in your heart just a
[1:39:45] heartbeat to say that God I need you is
[1:39:48] good enough to get it started and that
[1:39:51] will defeat any amount of devil that can
[1:39:54] be turned around
[1:39:57] you let me just go forward I'm sorry I I
[1:40:00] I
[1:40:05] just and so he
[1:40:08] says if you are married to Christ Christ
[1:40:11] is the word it says St John the first
[1:40:15] chapter says in the beginning was the
[1:40:17] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:40:19] Word was God and the same was made flesh
[1:40:21] and dwelt Among Us it says Christ was
[1:40:24] the Living Word he always was the word
[1:40:28] it says he still he is still the word
[1:40:30] he's always and will be the word he was
[1:40:33] only manifested he was only the
[1:40:36] manifestation of the attribute of God
[1:40:39] for he was the son of God he says and
[1:40:42] any
[1:40:43] son forgive me
[1:41:13] any son is the attribute of the father
[1:41:15] just you were in the gene of your father
[1:41:19] in the body of your father when he was a
[1:41:21] young boy he says and he was uh you were
[1:41:24] in him yet he couldn't have fellowship
[1:41:27] with you because he didn't know you but
[1:41:30] then through the beding ground of your
[1:41:33] mother the beding ground of the ground
[1:41:36] of a mother you were brought forth into
[1:41:40] the Earth and became in the image of
[1:41:42] your father then he could have
[1:41:44] fellowship with you so you were it says
[1:41:47] so you so you so were you sons of God
[1:41:50] and Daughters of God before the found
[1:41:52] before there was a a moon and star and a
[1:41:56] or a molecule you were sons of God you
[1:41:59] were only it says you are only the
[1:42:02] physical manifestation of the attribute
[1:42:05] that was in God at the beginning for
[1:42:08] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:42:10] and that was you am and that was you now
[1:42:14] think about that that was you before it
[1:42:16] says you you don't know nothing about it
[1:42:19] neither did you when you were when you
[1:42:22] was in your Earthly father but you are
[1:42:25] manifested too in the His Image in the
[1:42:29] image of God you are made and you were
[1:42:32] manifested for the glory of the uh and
[1:42:36] The Fellowship Of God and therefore as
[1:42:39] sure as the as your Gene had been uh
[1:42:43] your Gene had to be in your father
[1:42:45] before the the natural birth your
[1:42:47] spiritual de had to be in God because
[1:42:50] you are an expression of the attribute
[1:42:53] of his thought before the foundation of
[1:42:55] the world right no it says no way around
[1:42:58] it that's right he says now notice then
[1:43:01] the life that life being in you God's
[1:43:04] life being in you that from the
[1:43:07] foundation of the
[1:43:10] world let me say this that that's that's
[1:43:14] a lot to
[1:43:15] understand but I I want us to to to to
[1:43:20] come in an understanding that God is is
[1:43:24] wanting to let us know that there is
[1:43:26] really nothing new Under the Sun what
[1:43:30] what we are seeing is part of the plan
[1:43:32] that he already established what what
[1:43:35] he's telling us is we we we are coming
[1:43:38] into what was already spoken remember we
[1:43:41] said the word of God is a prophecy so
[1:43:45] now he lets us come through sin he he
[1:43:48] allows that to happen he allows us to
[1:43:51] come and and and come and know nothing
[1:43:53] about him and be born in sin and and
[1:43:55] darkness and all of that but he knew
[1:43:58] that within us there was a seed that he
[1:44:00] had placed and he also knew that when we
[1:44:02] would hear the word of God we will come
[1:44:04] to the understanding of who we were so
[1:44:07] now the prophet is telling you the
[1:44:09] Journey of your life how that where you
[1:44:11] came from and how that you go back to
[1:44:14] God so it's not us being caught up
[1:44:16] within the journey or what's happened
[1:44:19] what's happened people could have hurt
[1:44:21] you things could have gone wrong it's
[1:44:23] says that didn't matter what really
[1:44:25] matter was so you know that you were
[1:44:27] part of God in the beginning and the
[1:44:29] word that you're hearing this morning is
[1:44:31] to remind you of where you came
[1:44:38] from now if we are Gene of
[1:44:41] God then we have the characteristics of
[1:44:44] God and if we have the characteristics
[1:44:46] of God how should we conduct
[1:44:50] ourselves you see so it's always been
[1:44:53] getting caught up
[1:44:55] between the natural and the spiritual
[1:44:59] it's always getting caught up between
[1:45:01] what Satan interpretation of your life
[1:45:04] is with what God's interpretation of
[1:45:06] your life is God don't want us to come
[1:45:09] here this morning hear the word of God
[1:45:12] and go out there and act according to
[1:45:15] the interpretation of your
[1:45:19] flesh that will be a disservice to our
[1:45:21] own selves
[1:45:25] it it will do us no good to come here
[1:45:28] this morning and figure out how we're
[1:45:30] going to translate what we heard within
[1:45:33] our daily
[1:45:36] lives it wouldn't help us if our
[1:45:39] decision making is always getting caught
[1:45:42] between what is the scripture says and
[1:45:44] what do I
[1:45:45] do what oh if we can only come with the
[1:45:48] approach that no matter what decision I
[1:45:51] make I'm a Son of God to begin
[1:45:54] with I don't make a decision should I
[1:45:57] take that job should I I'm a Son of God
[1:46:00] therefore I make a decision as a Son of
[1:46:02] God I'm a Son of God therefore I conduct
[1:46:05] myself as a Son of God I can make
[1:46:07] mistake left and right but that doesn't
[1:46:10] take the sunship away the sunship is to
[1:46:12] bring me in remembrance that what you
[1:46:14] did here is not okay come back to
[1:46:18] it I'm not in bondage between God and
[1:46:21] what God is saying and what said no I
[1:46:24] cannot be between law and Grace at all
[1:46:26] time I need to be free from law and walk
[1:46:29] in
[1:46:35] Grace Oh my he he says in this message
[1:46:38] he begins to talk about how he says yeah
[1:46:41] you are you are caught between two
[1:46:42] marriages and you are married to your
[1:46:44] flesh you if I could say anything this
[1:46:47] morning we need to let the flesh
[1:46:51] die we we need if we walk every time we
[1:46:54] walk up part of our prayer should be
[1:46:57] Lord I want to be everything you say I
[1:46:59] want this flesh to die every
[1:47:02] day he he looks at you and says yeah you
[1:47:05] are you think you are married to the
[1:47:07] Flesh and married to him he said that
[1:47:09] the marriage in the flesh cannot even
[1:47:11] count because before you were even born
[1:47:14] you were already married to
[1:47:17] him go think that
[1:47:19] out it cannot even count because before
[1:47:23] you can be manifested in this flesh you
[1:47:26] already belong to him to begin
[1:47:29] with thank you
[1:47:31] Lord he says justification doesn't mean
[1:47:35] pardon justification is not forgiveness
[1:47:39] justification is everything that was
[1:47:42] accounted to you it never existed it's
[1:47:45] gone justification you never done it in
[1:47:49] the first
[1:47:51] place my brother my sister said I can't
[1:47:53] contain it within my own mind um that
[1:47:56] I'm Justified I'm the one that did wrong
[1:47:59] I'm the one who spoke evil I'm the one
[1:48:01] who did all of that he looks at you he
[1:48:03] says no that was your flesh you were
[1:48:05] tricked into it but before God before
[1:48:09] the word of God because the word that
[1:48:11] was spoken for you to begin with was
[1:48:14] that you'll be a son therefore there's
[1:48:16] nothing that could be put on your
[1:48:19] account and you tell me I don't need to
[1:48:22] be happy about that you tell me I can't
[1:48:25] Rejoice about that you tell me I have to
[1:48:27] keep quiet about
[1:48:32] that I just think we're not crazy enough
[1:48:35] I'll just say that I I just think we're
[1:48:37] not CRA I am crazy I believe it I
[1:48:41] believe it with all my heart something
[1:48:44] within my my mind tells me I'm crazy my
[1:48:46] heart said I'm happy to be crazy
[1:48:50] [Music]
[1:48:53] he said before then he took the wedding
[1:48:56] band of predestination He Slipped it on
[1:48:59] your finger because he knew that the
[1:49:02] devil would try to trick you to get into
[1:49:04] this marriage so therefore God married
[1:49:07] you so if when the devil will come he
[1:49:10] will find that you were already married
[1:49:12] and he says because of dad God can come
[1:49:14] and said this marriage is an
[1:49:17] old he could erase it all
[1:49:23] think about the power of the blood God
[1:49:25] is able to take your sins everything
[1:49:28] that you did and break it apart as if it
[1:49:31] never
[1:49:33] existed
[1:49:36] Gone Gone oh you are a sinner gone all
[1:49:40] you did this let me say this when we get
[1:49:43] to Eternity we're not going to be played
[1:49:45] all the wrong that we did no that is in
[1:49:48] the sea of God forgetfulness not to be
[1:49:50] remembered anymore that tell you the
[1:49:53] celebration out there was that I knew
[1:49:55] what was happening down there and God
[1:49:58] came and he called me out of it and all
[1:50:00] of that is
[1:50:02] annihilated
[1:50:08] gone that has to cause us to have the
[1:50:13] Thanksgiving in our
[1:50:14] hearts and if we truly claim to believe
[1:50:18] it to believe it this morning then we
[1:50:20] have to tell the neighbor about it then
[1:50:24] to have to walk in it to say God has
[1:50:26] done this for me he can do the same for
[1:50:29] you oh I'm not good enough and then yeah
[1:50:32] he's taken all of your good enough he's
[1:50:34] bundled it and threw it out and he's
[1:50:37] giving you a portion of himself so you
[1:50:39] can look at it and say I am just as God
[1:50:43] is so I am there's no what you see when
[1:50:47] you see God you see me when you see me
[1:50:50] you see God the he says the bride the
[1:50:53] bride cannot be anything different than
[1:50:56] what the bridegroom is otherwise they
[1:50:59] are not compatible if the bridegroom is
[1:51:01] the word so is the bride what does that
[1:51:04] mean to you the same characteristics the
[1:51:07] same everything that he was you are this
[1:51:12] morning that is what we are called to
[1:51:15] walk into if the musician could
[1:51:19] come we're not called to walk in defeat
[1:51:22] and look at us
[1:51:23] say oh the sickness come and then we we
[1:51:26] we fall oh God oh God God is looking at
[1:51:28] you says why cry speak why are you
[1:51:31] crying speak I but said if God had
[1:51:35] anything better to give you he would
[1:51:37] have given you but he gave you the best
[1:51:39] weapon the best that he was which was
[1:51:42] his word if his word calls you that you
[1:51:44] were an overcomer this morning don't let
[1:51:47] anything call you anything
[1:51:50] different and I don't care if it's your
[1:51:53] failures in the flesh I don't care what
[1:51:56] is it that you have that's troubling you
[1:51:58] this morning you just repeat what God
[1:52:01] Said The God Who said it will come to
[1:52:03] fulfill
[1:52:11] it what a Grace to be called sons of God
[1:52:14] this morning let's all stand
[1:52:35] but what I'm going
[1:52:38] say how did you come to
[1:52:41] this you were deceived into it by your
[1:52:43] first
[1:52:44] marriage to your ad daughter's parent
[1:52:47] Eve it's no fault of your own by your
[1:52:51] natural birth
[1:52:53] Earth you came after Eve who committed
[1:52:56] adultery that's the reason you were born
[1:52:58] in adulter
[1:53:00] adulteress it
[1:53:04] says you were a sinner to begin with
[1:53:08] that's
[1:53:09] right you was deceived into it you had
[1:53:13] no he it says he ENT your
[1:53:17] fault you never did it because that ill
[1:53:21] germ that that was in
[1:53:23] you that was to be you before the
[1:53:26] foundation of the world God put your
[1:53:29] name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:53:32] [Music]
[1:53:34] Life why are you calling yourself
[1:53:36] righteous God put my name in the Lamb's
[1:53:40] Book of Life God chose to do that God
[1:53:45] decided he made the decision before I
[1:53:47] can make
[1:53:49] mine he decided for me before I can know
[1:53:53] even what a decision I was making here I
[1:53:56] am and the just going in sin and all of
[1:53:59] that is looking at you it's like oh
[1:54:01] don't worry about it I already made a
[1:54:03] decision for you he placed your name and
[1:54:06] because he did that it doesn't matter
[1:54:09] what the cycle of Life take you through
[1:54:12] you could stand there and say I am
[1:54:16] justified but when I'm talks about the
[1:54:18] sheave wave
[1:54:20] offering he said that
[1:54:22] there were grains that were planted in
[1:54:24] the field and when the it because
[1:54:27] remember the sheave wave offering was a
[1:54:30] celebration what they would do is they
[1:54:32] would look and the first sheave that
[1:54:35] will come to maturity they will look at
[1:54:38] it they will stand and take it and wave
[1:54:40] it before the people and the
[1:54:42] congregation Will Rejoice praise God
[1:54:44] praise God praise God why were they
[1:54:47] rejoicing but I'm going say that it's
[1:54:49] because they knew that all of the other
[1:54:51] seed that were planted will come to that
[1:54:54] same maturity if the first one was
[1:54:57] producing what God Said will produce
[1:55:00] there is no doubt there is no devil
[1:55:03] there's nothing that could stop the
[1:55:05] others to Rejoice because they knew that
[1:55:07] they will come to the same maturity God
[1:55:10] in our age he sent a prophet not only he
[1:55:13] was a prophet but he was also a member
[1:55:15] of a bride he took a man that was born
[1:55:17] of sin and he so filled his life that a
[1:55:20] man could come and he could could speak
[1:55:22] scroll into existence he could stop the
[1:55:25] storm he could live such a life that
[1:55:27] people will look at him and think it was
[1:55:32] Jesus people will look at a man born of
[1:55:35] sin and think they saw Jesus my brother
[1:55:39] my sister that was not just for the
[1:55:41] prophet we can Rejoice this morning and
[1:55:43] say praise God why because we are of the
[1:55:46] same crop we are of the same seed we are
[1:55:50] of the same age we are of the same hour
[1:55:53] that that same life that live in him is
[1:55:55] living in you this morning to bring you
[1:55:58] to that same
[1:56:00] maturity yes
[1:56:02] sir you know I like that story but when
[1:56:05] him talks about the man with his wife
[1:56:07] and they called to the hospital to come
[1:56:10] and pray for the
[1:56:11] daughter he came and he said that the
[1:56:15] nurses and the doctors they looked in it
[1:56:17] it seemed to have been fine everything
[1:56:20] to see I'm talking about Thanksgiving
[1:56:22] they looked at it and they said oh he's
[1:56:24] gone too far we never have measurements
[1:56:27] like this and it seems like this is
[1:56:29] impossible nothing can ever be done
[1:56:31] according to their readings and
[1:56:33] everything it seems like everything was
[1:56:34] gone too far but all this couple all
[1:56:37] that they wanted was just the prophet to
[1:56:39] come and pray and then the prophet came
[1:56:41] and stumbling there and perhaps a little
[1:56:44] bit late and he showed up and and then
[1:56:46] the nurse comes and he goes and
[1:56:48] everybody he says what he says oh the
[1:56:50] prophet here can you pray and the the
[1:56:52] prophet says a little prayer nothing
[1:56:54] happened zero they it prayed and
[1:56:58] everything and they said oh they done
[1:57:00] praying and all of that and they left
[1:57:01] and everything and as he was leaving the
[1:57:03] nurse looked at him and said I can't
[1:57:05] believe you just did that it says what
[1:57:08] did you do it says that kid is in the
[1:57:11] condition that he never been before we
[1:57:13] have ever never had any recording of
[1:57:15] such data and the person comes back and
[1:57:19] then he looks at them and said he
[1:57:20] started talking to the dad and all of
[1:57:22] the sudden because of the prayer the
[1:57:24] parents begin to Rejoice oh praise God
[1:57:28] this is going to work out our problem is
[1:57:30] we pray we keep worried we pray but we
[1:57:33] still have pray fear my brother my
[1:57:36] sister once you already pray you just go
[1:57:38] on rejoicing you just go on praising God
[1:57:42] what we need after prayer is rejoicing
[1:57:44] and Thanksgiving what we need after
[1:57:47] prayer is just to praise God oh he's
[1:57:49] already taken care of and they just
[1:57:51] begin to danc and to just shout and oh
[1:57:54] praise God we heard the word of God we

[2:02:02] will come down with the shout and the
