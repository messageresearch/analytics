be with us and your wonderful and holy precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated maybe somebody could run grab my mic or maybe I could run and grab my mind but then we'd have an empty an empty pulpit I preached a sermon about the unseen God now I was going to preach a sermon about the unseen congregation and then the next one would be the unseen preacher this is a good thing that this just happened and you'll see in a moment why we just want to continue to let you know you have the freedom to do all that you didn't feel that you need to do to protect yourself in any way we'll provide what spacing we can for people and wearing masks they kind of asked us to wear masks outside so we try to do that and try to do spacing inside they say it's optional so I say it's optional you can wear masks if you like if you don't like what I preach put a mask on and you can murmur all you want nobody'll know but so we try to do that and I explained the other day that people say well why are you conforming to this well let me say it this way the the government gives us as a church special benefits they don't tax us for our land they give special benefits to the ministry they they they do things for churches and sometimes I think to show that we appreciate that then we try to conform to the things they ask us to do there would be no quicker way to close down churches than to tax them so just to give you an example they appraise this church at about eight hundred and fifty thousand I'm not counting the property next door so if you took the property next door with this church this area would appraise for around a million three and the tax rate on that would be like eight dollars per thousand so we'd have about an $80,000 a year tax bill and and you are the best most generous people in the world but we have not risen to the occasion of eighty thousand dollars of the year and nor would I put the pressure upon you to do that but so anyway we're trying to do our best and I know that anybody can find little flaws here and there but in my heart I I abide because the scripture says agree with them quickly lest they deliver in your prison and that they're servants of the Lord to carry out the wrath of God against them that are disobedient on the other hand I think church is the safest place in the world to be you know because you have all people that are here aren't out in the world they're not in places where bad things are going they keep their distance from people I think it's great I can stay away from people and they just stay away from me it it makes it nice so we're doing those things for those purposes now Sunday evening it's it's going to be an outdoor setting so you know you can wear your mask and then like they do in a restaurant you wear your mask into the door you sit down at the table you take your mask on the waitress leans over you and put your food there and hauls the food all through the kitchen past everybody that's sitting there without their masks and sets it on your table now you're worried about that brother McGarrett no I pray over that food you know what I mean I place it into the hands of the Lord and and that's all we can do so we're not going to get a rebellious spirit but you know we had some extra seats sunday and you know we're not going to turn anybody away that comes to the house of the Lord if we have to put a row of chairs right down the middle we'll do that we want people to come hear the gospel and so there's a lot of conspiracy theories going on but we don't need to know what the conspiracy theories are we don't need to know what Satan's up to as long as we know what this is up to and if we know what this is up to then we can follow this this is our guide through the time this has been interpreted to us in the last day by a prophet messenger who came and was vindicated there were scriptural promises in the Bible behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the Great and dreadful day of the Lord that was a prophecy that was fulfilled in one person was in a spirit in the days of the voice of the seventh angel fulfilled in one person those are Pacific ritual prophecies that came to pass in the flesh all the Word of God comes to pass in the flesh all through the Old Testament they prophesied and they spoke of one that would come one that would be like this one would be like that and then finally that word showed up in the flesh and manifested in the flesh in the person called the Lord Jesus Christ and He fulfilled everything that was prophesied concerning him many of it was prophesied fulfilled in the last three or four hours of his life so just remember this God's Word is on time it's coming to pass perfectly and and there's a reason behind it all we might not know all the things that are going on but we know we have a vindicated word that will feed our souls and we can rest in assuredly in that this evening so we just like to have a little subject now tonight we're having communion but we're not having foot washing it's because of the seating and the arrangements it makes it easier without moving a lot of things around plus it avoids any uncomfortable contact so there's no pressure in any of this to show yourself spiritual you understand if you feel comfortable putting on a mask it doesn't mean you're any less spiritual than I am I haven't figured out how to breathe in a mask let alone preach so just be a cover so we're not anti what the government's doing where we're supporting them we're we try to wear our masks for the people who are in fear so we're not the cause of putting any fear upon them but may they see in our spirits and in art or they can't see our smiles but may they see in our atmosphere that we have a joy bringing in our heart amen so we don't want to do that so let's go ahead and stand and we'll open our Bibles and we're gonna read some scriptures and you'll kind of figure out pretty quick I think what I'm going to preach on but let me just draw the conclusion it won't be long and we'll move right into communion so let's turn in our Bibles we're going to reread for what we'll do is I'll read this first passage of Scripture then we'll be seated and read the rest of the scriptures first Timothy the first chapter the 16th verse is what I believe that I have written here and I don't know if that's going to be right but that isn't dealt with a little bit different let's go to turn over to Titus and we'll start at Titus 2 & 7 Titus 2 & 7 so let's read there so in Titus 2 & 7 it says he's speaking there and he says in the fourth verse he says that they may teach this is a Titus the 2nd chapter starting with the 4th verse that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husband's that the word of the Lord be not blaspheme young men likewise exhort to be sober-minded in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine showing uncorrupt in this gravity and sincerity in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works amen you may be seated and so I'm going to read a scripture here I think this is the one I found in Timothy 1 in 6 howbeit for this cause that you can turn there and the 15th verse says of first Timothy chapter 1 this is a faithful saying in other words something this is something we can say with confidence and it's a true saying it says this is a faithful saying and worthy of all accepted Jesus that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which hurt here which should hereafter believe on him to ever lasting light so Paul saying that my my conversion and God allowed me to take this course because that would be a first thing is why would God allow the first church age messenger the Apostles to the Gentiles to persecute the church it makes no sense you wouldn't think that something would transpire it transpired that way but now Paul comes back and he says that this mercy was shown forth to me because it now laid a pattern for every believer that hereafter believe to know that God saved the cheapest of all sinners and we would sit back oh one that even persecuted the church consented unto the death of Stephen and that was his testimony he that once persecuted is now a part of us but Paul said that was laying there as a pattern so now what we're seeing is there was a pattern that was laid out for every Gentile that was going to come after that because the Gentiles that were going to come after that were not sanctified under the law so to speak as much as the law could give sanctification so it was it was a pattern so he's got the message that's going to go out to the Gentiles and what the message to those Gentiles is those that were that were adulterous as those that were drunkards though that were thieves those that lived in all kinds of manner of sins things which wouldn't even be mentioned in Israel without being stoned and Paul representing that spirit of the law that went out and and tried to purge Israel of those that blaspheme in the name of this one called Jesus so to end Paul there's a pattern in his life of who that he was how that he studied how he stunned ER studied under Gamaliel he was this great this great orator and zealous in the law now it Paul's berrykin version showed the exit from the law to grace so there was actually a pattern in Paul's life that of what he was trying to do so if what he represented what he stood for how that he thought he was doing it out of righteousness now his conversion and launch this long-suffering of God and it shows the pattern of conversion that God was going to use for everybody that was converted amongst the Gentiles and thereafter that God was going to be long-suffering and forgiving sins so we understand that that and that's what I want to kind of work towards tonight in just a few moments that there's a pattern of the way God does things God has a pattern though the people that can see that pattern there's actually arts and skills and people go to school to try to find patterns a reoccurring event but but the greatest pattern anybody could ever find is the pattern of how God does things because if he ever does one thing one way he'll continue to do it forever so that Paul says this is a faithful saying that Jesus Christ came to save sinners you don't have to be qualified to be a sinner we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God but there was a pattern even and the purpose for Paul's conversion the way that it was it literally represented a departure from the law which Paul was defending with vigor to the experience personal experience that Paul had of personally meeting the Lord Jesus Christ and being saved by grace oh it's awesome I like it amen the pattern that the Lord has and then when we turn I I think we just read that Titus about Paul is now talking to Titus saying lay for yourself a pattern of good works what wife it was he's asking he's telling Titus Titus he wants Titus to be a good pastor he wants him to have a good church he wants him to be a real representing a representation of what the love of God is and the gospel stands for and so if he tells Titus he says tell tell the people how to live basically he was telling them the pattern which they should follow and then he's just lay for yourself a pattern of good works something that could be identified therefore it's by the pattern if something is random it's very difficult to understand from whence it comes if it's just something that blips in but if it's a pattern if it repeats itself over and over again then you can sit back and you can look it and you understand there has to be something I don't want to sound like a scientist but there has to be something that causes the pattern it's just not random you know I like to shoot pistols and and I could take the target and I could stand there you know they changed the way you used to shoot used to shoot like this and then they said that's no good stand more sideways where they can hit you better but they found out if you face your target like this you have better control and also by the way that you shoot you can understand what's happening in your pattern so as I shoot at the target a pattern emerges I change the target a pattern emerges a pattern emerges a pattern emerges then someone that can look at that thing they can automatically tell what I'm doing and what I do is I push my the inside of my palm I push it in when I pull the trigger and it's always taking the bullet no right no right so you know I might be pointing at the top of the target but a patterns going to emerge a patterns going to emerge now so if I try to correct that pattern by turning my gun that's not gonna work now I'm lower left or will higher high left and the pattern emerges but they can find the caused by the pattern something's causing the pattern so Paul's came Timothy later yourself a pattern of good works because of this pattern of good work it's going to identify that there's something working in you because we know that our actions speak louder than our words so there's got to be a pattern that emerges and and we see from the scripture that God is an institute er of patterns God has a pattern you say well how is that we were taught that if God ever does one thing one way he has to continually do it the same way so in other words that pattern is going to repeat itself repeat itself if he ever forgave one sinner of his sins on the basis that that sinner came to him and asked for forgiveness he will repeat that pattern over and over and over again look I want to get that part of what I want to share with you this evening down you've got to understand God as a God of pattern you say give me another example the Sun has been rising in setting for a long time it's a daily pattern that men know that there's death burial and resurrection when the prophet of God spoke to the infidel and he asked the infidel who wear those apples he says that tree every year when it gets cold that tree loses its leaves and goes down into the crown but every spring that life comes back up out of that ground God laid that pattern there of death burial and resurrection it's everywhere that in the pattern that the invisible things of God can clearly be seen in the visible things around us remember the story of a little lady that the little girl that was in the rowboat of the little boy that was in the rowboat and he asked the question has shown me God he said I see God everywhere why because he's in the pattern he's in the pattern of creation he's in the patter of the blue bird singing he's in all these things the pattern oh my goodness I think it behooves to understand that there's something trying to blind us that he becomes the unrecognized God man tries to establish his own pattern and therefore they don't recognize that God has been very very fair to us been long-suffering he's done everything he's can thought the the the pattern is there so if he wants he wants him to lay a pattern of good works in doctrine showing uncorrupted us gravity sincerity sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is contrary they that he is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you oh my did you imagine if we all could just adopt and understand there's a reason for a good conversation there's a reason for works that we stand blameless and that we could take that word and run that all through the scripture plain let's be blameless you know and again so the reason of that is Paul is understanding there was a pattern wrath of God in me now I'm going to see this is the pattern of salvation so now he's telling Titus Titus if you lay for yourself a pattern of good works it becomes a living gospel and the effect of not having any blame for them to lay on you is that they become ashamed what's another word for that they become convicted they come under conviction and you know you don't know it and I know I've shared this with you before but just so that you can understand I worked as electrician a long time when I was younger and the church was very small and I went every day the job and I was a Christian I'd read my Bible I wouldn't cuss I wouldn't you know I would do the things like any Christian would do nothing if spectacular of myself was just the Lord had saved me and I was a Christian basic Christian believed the message and I didn't even realize it because I was about my business but they would put on the rock and roll stations as loud as they could I just figured all they all had demons they had to feed it they did it with the intention of aggravating me they'd moved my tools they were locked my box they would do all this stuff and without knowing it's totally Beyonc to me I would I thought I left my toolbox here oh praise the Lord here's where I left it and then they were on a full mission to flip me out and get me to speak vilely about the God and they say you're gonna watch the cowboy game this Sunday no no I'm going to church if they like to rent their clothes this is what was going on inside of them I never knew it I was about my business and not to speak of me I just had a lot of flaws and a lot of frustrations like any person does but I didn't understand that they were viewing me through their eyes one day I'm at electrical counter picking up parts and this great big fella about the size of Big John back there that's Big John Beale in the back rather big John Beale and I thought I was dead this guy comes sauntering over to me he said are you David McGarry I said I am did I park in your spot what did I do you know I mean I just pulled in here park where I always do it didn't mean to offend you in any way did I get the last part that you were looking for and this great big guy they're starting to get the sniffles you're seeing a kid you spanking it gets the sniffles you know what I mean this great big I began to sniffle and I thought what did I do in tears started pouring down his face he said I've been looking for you for three years I thought I'm really in trouble then I thought did I owe you money he says he remembered that job out at Texas Instruments he says yes a while back I was working for I think Hearst Electric or something he says we out there tried to just make your job a living hell for you and I said he said I want to apologize for you I have come to know the Lord Jesus and I'm so ashamed of how that I treated you I always felt that somewhere in that process that got to him why because it's a pattern it's the way God works never be ashamed of the reproach that you bear by laying for yourself a holy life in a holy style it is a part of the pattern of salvation we get all politically trying to be correct not to offend anybody we're the very actions the pattern of good works that the Holy Spirit has placed in your lives is for the very purpose of bringing conviction so he knows what he's doing you've just got to have such confidence so what we're talking about tonight just a little bit is that God has a pattern you have to understand that God if God is not out of control nothing he hasn't missed anything you know someone told me one time he says oh I just can't believe that got past the Lord I said that thing didn't get past the Lord I had to go help a man on the side of the road because he bought a battery that was no good if he didn't understand that was the whole pattern of things so I got out there and I got to testify to him and he looked over said oh I just can't believe that this got by the Lord no it did to get by the Lord you're hearing the truth you know and so you've got to understand that many of the things that happen in your life are part of the pattern that God's unfolding and that you got preached less than any morning the part that you play in the plan of God well you have to understand if you're in that plan of God there's a pattern that's going to reoccur in your life over and over and over again God is working his pattern through you you might think oh I've got my own little life my own little world my whole total separation I'm not Pardo's what I'm doing he does and he fits and joins the body together that the pattern that he's trying to present might be manifested in the flesh so there's a pattern we just want to lay that down let's turn over to Hebrews the eighth chapter now I'd like to stay on this section for a long time because it's really deep but let's just start in the first verse of the eighth chapter of Hebrews I mean if this is such a great subject about Malky so that these two chapters go back and read them you'll get lost in them they're so magnificent now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum so he just went all through Melchizedek the priesthood he says this is the son of what this is what I'm coming to this is what I'm trying to say this is the son we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitch a--the and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifice wherefore it is of the necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offered gifts according to the law whose serveth unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as Moses was a Mohnish dove God who was about to make the tabernacle for saith he that maketh all things according to the pattern showeth to thee in the mountain but now have he obtained a more excellent ministry but how much also is he the mediator for a better covenant which was established upon better promises so he's talking about the high priest and that the high priest had certain functions that he that he did in offering gifts and sacrifices and and the the Lord was very specific to Moses to tell Moses follow this pattern exactly the quartering of the beasts the burning of it the way that all these things are done because all these things were shadows and types bearing witness to a greater one that was not going to make an earthly mediation but was going to make a heavenly mediation that wasn't going to make an earthly sanctification what was going to make a spiritual sanctification why because he's fixing to depart from the natural pattern of natural things and moved to the spiritual pattern of spiritual things if you follow Paul's gospel and you ever got into this main of the types of the Old Testament to what Paul was teaching the Gentiles he was always teaching the Gentiles the pattern of God how God was rich in mercy how God rewarded he didn't labor them in the the law because he said if you have the spirit you fulfill the law you don't walk after the law which is of the flesh but you walk after the spirit so you fulfill the thing that the law put currently you fulfill the pattern of the law to grace in the Spirit of the Lord so we could go into that for a wonderful time but it was important to follow the pattern so you understand that pay I don't know maybe some of you are asking yourselves right now is there any pattern to my life most people who aren't successful have a pattern how many knows one of the patterns the prophet of God told us to do every day read our Bible and pray what is that that's a pattern because a pattern is going to produce results if I went and said I lifted weights today you'd look at me and say yeah but if I lifted weights in a continual pattern over a period of time the evidence of the pattern would now begin to manifest now if I told you that I had the best pizza last night and I had pasta today and this you would look at me and say yeah I see you have a pattern of carbs and that is evident is there evidence that you have a pattern of carp many times even in counseling people come in and they talk to me and they have worries and problems and all these things and I'll actually have to sit down with them and be honest with them that it would do you good to take care of yourself eat good exercise do these things you say well physical exercise that profiteth little don't you don't misinterpret that scripture for her to let your life go to pieces I'll never forget when Dalston Rolly talked about time he walked he walked all these mountains and he went up there and down through valleys and woods and everything he said there ain't a man in the world that could follow me and he was quite a bit younger than brother here comes brother round did you see this did you see that did you see this did you see that it was evident that he had walked it was evident that he had hunted it was evident and you know he made a tremendous statement he says one step look in place you know it because there is so much pattern with God that if you if you don't start bringing that into your thinking you let everything that's fed to you start controlling the way you think so let's read our last scripture and then I'll finish up and we can go and this is found in Hebrews 9 chapter starting with the nineteenth verse and again this is another thing about Testament and living and debt is tremendous but for when Moses had spoken every precept to all every when Moses has spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the books and all the people saying this is the blood of the Testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkle it with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission it was necessary that the patterns of these things in the heavens should be purified with these so there was a pattern laid down you understand so he's saying that these patterns they purified earthly things earthly vessels earthly Tabernacles earthly people but he says that they heavens needed to be purified in this same pattern ok so it without blood there was nothing that purified it you understand that he purified both the heavens and the earth glory that's why we're going to get a new heavens and a new earth because the blood fell on the earth to redeem the earth the spirit that was in the blood returned back upon the believer oh that's exciting the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these with better sacrifices than goats and lambs with a better sacrifice who's that hallelujah the son of God himself purifying the very creation that he created being the Word of God for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us Wow what a pattern he actually showed us that he's in heaven right now with his what sacrifice with the blood that He shed making intercession for us no wonder the Prophet tried to tell us there's only one provided place of worship and it's under the shed blood not a finished work at Calvary so to speak but an on-going high priest that that taketh our infirmities upon himself and now is sitting at the presence of God making intercession for us oh my that's where I want to meet him I want to meet him in that pattern I want to meet him where he's at I want to meet and what he's doing don't ever get to the place to think that you can have a spiritual relationship with God through the intellectual conception of doctrine God is worshiped in spirit and in truth seeks such to worship Him it is a wonderful relationship now I said that to say this you say brother Gary you could have saved us all a lot of time and just said it but I read that scripture that Paul said I said all these things to sum this up God is an evolutionist another word he worked from a pattern he evolves in other words for evolutionist is a nun folder he doesn't go to the final product when he starts the final product he starts the process evolutive and moving towards the final product he does that so he can have fellowship with you which was one of his purposes he talked about Michelangelo in the end in the message who is this Melchizedek and he's talking all through that book about how that he started in the prophets and began to chisel away working towards the final image of Christ and he said Michelangelo he just tried he's using this story to get the image into your mind the purpose of getting the image into your mind is to under for you to understand that you are that rock that God's working on and so he gets there and he says Michelangelo starts carving he has an image in his mind that's the word a thought that he wants to express so he's saying God had a thought in his mind so he wanted to express that thought and he wanted that ought to be recognized so he laid a pattern in all his people a pattern in Moses a pattern and daven a pattern in the profits that these prophets were moved upon and brotherman made this statement he said they didn't even know why the things were happening to them in their life how many knows he said they were forced into a pattern not understanding that the very things that they were going through was a reflection or a pattern of that which perfect thing was to come glory to God and soak he's he's evolving working his way to that perfect son he's an evolutionist he unfolds that and so we understand that then he had a bride now without going into all the church ages and coming down the seven church ages which we may do a little bit and the horse riders but God was evolving his church he's giving more word to his church he's revealing to his church his my church is maturing by sitting in the Esso end of the Word of God there was no gospel on earth that can mature the bride because they were bound from the secrets that were hid in the seals so God came and veiled himself in a prophet he used the Prophet as the veil he was hit him and he used that bill so he could unrevealed and open up the pattern and he could open up the seals and once that mystery was opened up now there was a gospel there that could perfect the bride now real men they probed at it they would look at it and they'd say oh the tenant the the League of Nations or the european union or whatever that's the ten toes of daniel well daniel lost his foot does that end it and they had all these things they were probing at because they were blinded to the pattern of god they were blinded to the fact that god is evolving this church in the same way he does the world he does the church he does the individual all of you have been involving those that know me thirty forty years ago i hope i've made some progress not much but a little i ain't what i want to be i mean what i need to be but any what i used to be there's a transformation god's a transformer he's transforming he's transforming he uses circumstance to do that he uses to tried think you're not strange at the trying of your faith is more precious in gold because all that he justified he sanctifies now that he sanctifies he glorifies all these things work together for it good dope don't you see all those scriptures are telling you about the pattern of god there is a pattern of god that god has and that's what satan has always tried to do is break the pattern stop the evolution what do you think all this is that's going on it's stopping the evolution of the believer people are becoming complaint people are are finding themselves caught up in fear their actions are changing their view of the futures changing I have a view of the future watch me demonstrate you know how much I'd love just a step behind that curtain and become the invisible pastor my vision is out of here this is not a stain gospel it's a leaving gospel so you understand what's happening he's trying to break and stop the evolution of you evolving growing laying for yourself a pattern of fed works he wants me to abandon things that you've always done he's a disrupter he's the author of what confusion have you ever seen a bunch of scientific smart people who are so confused by a bug I'll tell you what kills that bug is prayer laying on his hands fast and pray for somebody call the mercies down for heaven he said he would not leave you nor forsake you he said he's a high priest that can be touched but by the infirmities you say well we shouldn't get it then that's fine I might get it they tell me I might have it I don't know I could be asymptomatic earth or no symptoms or you know they try to make everybody out to be a death machine I'm not a death machine I'm a life machine I've got the Word of God in me and I've been told that I can impart eternal life cuz faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of just stay away from everybody and don't tell them well maybe I need to put on my mask Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 hurry revelations 10 7 the hole they'll send you alive to the Prophet the mystery something but they want to shut you up they want to shut your actions up they want to do everything don't you see he's disrupting the evolution of the church the personal evolution of your growth in Christ your your fellowship with him in the revealed Word of the hour that was spoken to us through a messenger that message is left Messenger is left but the message that he gave us was not started in 59 or back or whenever that message was lying in heaven before the foundation of the world it was the time of its delivering and he delivered it in his season showed us the pattern and now the real church is living it out it's coming out coming out growing moving moving on now all of a sudden we're getting close to the end saying says I'd better shut this down all right how to break them up these people can't stay together I got to get them some of the fall away I've got it I can't let this group grow I can't let this group do it and I'm just not talking about this church I'm talking about the bright I've got to get their mind off of winning souls I've got to get their mind off of sharing this message I've got to get everybody around them so afraid that if they get within six feet well let me tell you the Scriptures can travel six feet your testimony travels miles and in this day and age overnight you don't think so make a mistake I'll guarantee if I took that happen in my life that wasn't right by morning every preacher in the world would know it I knew he was a rat I could have told you that well I sure wish you to come and told me before I got in the mass but that's a pattern the tongue is an unruly member hard to bridle so you sit back and you begin to understand that that what confusion does is it stops the pattern and then we drop out of the evolution the experience of God is an evolution that goes on in every individual it grows year after year after year after year things that bother you you they're so insignificant to you now you want to get caught up in heavenly places you you want to see the bigger picture it guy preach the sermon on that the bigger picture what I'm saying is don't get caught up in the little things understand that God is trying to evolve this charge and the circumstance that he's put here is for our evolution don't let it do what the enemy's trying to do and stop your evolution or your growing or your manifesting the attributes of God don't let this stop you from spiritually growth don't let this crisis stop your spiritual growth press into it more than ever you need spiritual growth now more than ever you need to contact this message dig into it look into it read it read your Bible pray you need to find your place in the plan of God and find those for ordained works the pattern of good works that God for ordained for you before the foundation of the world that you walk in them or otherwise you're wishy-washy you're in and out you're up and down every storm that blows it's the end of the world I want to solve that question once and for all it is the end of the world I've got the saith the Lord we're at the end time you say well you know there's a lot of things ending the sanity of man is ending reverence is ending respect is ending democracy as we know it is ending respect for lawless dirt Law & Order is ending respect for one another is ending men judging by the outward appearance when God Himself judges from the inside out I mean I don't know if you understand it but Satan has stopped the evolution of mankind they're not evolving they're not getting better they're corrupt and now their corruption is eating their logical common decency of their minds Church of the Living God now's the time to stand up and let your light shine now is the time to evolve in Christ more than you've ever evolved don't let this stop your evolution and your spiritual growth but determined more than ever to grow in Christ Jesus hey man let's have communion that's part of spiritual growth let's love one another let's care one for another let's look after one for for another God the unveiling of God is taking place in you right now in this hour this circumstances has arisen so his church can arise and trim their lamp and let their light shine that their good works might glorify their father in heaven let's stand together if the brothers would go prepare the communion let's turn to the book of first corinthians the 11th chapter and the 23rd verse don't you love this you think you're gonna have fellowship you're gonna have fellowship with those Saints in the first church age because they're accepting this because Paul received it from the Lord and they love their messenger just like there's many things we receive that people don't understand because we know we've received it from a messenger so let's read this together as the brothers prepare Communion and we won't have foot washing this evening but we just have communion for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he give thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come what is this it's a pattern it's a pattern and I've already gave my whole thought on communion so I forgot what message it was in but it's there for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a minute Ammon himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged so that's what this time is this time to judge yourself is it time to say you're sorry for the things you've done it's decided to purpose in your heart that you're going to do better it doesn't mean if you've done something wrong you can't have communion what it means is deal with it confront it recognize it apologize for it he's just unfaithful to forgive and then go lay for yourself a pattern he that steel steel with no more but work with your hands that you might give so if you've said something bad about somebody go out and say something nice for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to tarry to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto come the nation in the rest will I set in order when I come let's all pray together our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're gonna take bread this evening which represents your word the great creative power the bread of life that cometh down from heaven that your body is meat indeed it's spiritual life does it's eternal life and we take it in remembrance of that and remembrance of the fact that you paid a price that has you in the presence of God making intercession for us we meet you on that ground and we bring this to remembrance Heavenly Father this line that represents the shed blood the stimulation of Revelation the life that was in the blood coming up back upon the believer we take it father that we testify that we've entered into communion with you and in fellowship with you and we're involving and growing into the statute of a perfect man we ask you to bless this deceive me in Jesus precious name we pray amen
