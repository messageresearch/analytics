Description:
2022 Watch Night Service
December 31, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

done is just work work as a bedside nurse and coming tomorrow or um it's it's a it's I was supposed to be working today and uh knowing that no one allows as a nurse to to take off and I says is it any way possible I can be taken off from work and I was not expecting that and within a second the email came or the text came that my shift is canceled and I'm here so that's number one so and it's okay to be scared the word says that he is not going to leave me and he's not going to forsake me I do not know what's coming I'm just excited for for for for tomorrow that's what I was telling my my co-workers you know like uh trade over my patients and uh if if you are in the in the state that you just do not know I just have a very peace what God has done for me on the cross of Calvary the fear

Jesus Jesus Jesus he just turned and face the other side and boom they really I opened I strapped my belt I came out I was just looking at the car I said look I know you have failed as usual for real

know he is going to take us through tomorrow this journey is getting tougher than ever but he promised he needs all he'll make a wealth escape and I've seen his hand at all three points of my life my brother was talking about nurses we go to work and cry every day especially when they put me in that cancer world I talked about that stop you put me there evidently crying I can't stand it people

out there up here I'm not sure if it's a testimonial song we'll take both either way shalom Shalom Church used to donate I just want to give us a little testimony [Music] when brother Billy asked who had a testimony to give me um it's like I felt someone tell me lift your hand stop it is you know I don't like coming up here foreign foreign this is my only observation but I believe there's a presence up here okay um I wanted to give a testimony in regard to an accident like I as Liza said I I I I held myself God made it so that the sister was over there can come and give a test I felt a condemnation Within Myself I could have not went back in peace like that I said even if by the Billy doesn't ask I'm gonna lift my hands and that's what I did before I even asked before I can get to the testimony you know when by predestination what God chose you may whether people want it like it or not they cannot do anything against it foreign my dad passed away when I was young I was about 11 years old he was poisoned because there were conflict of power he went to a church and they were supposed to take everybody from the family over today so they could see if there was a problem in the family when I presented myself with my family I see a man stand out loud never find me I was about nine and a half years old I was about around nine and a half years old it was a preacher who said this he took me by the hand he talked to everybody else just keep the details aside and then after that my my father passed away everywhere I went it was about the same when I meet someone who was given to Witchcraft even though they were family members they were always chasing me they didn't want my presence near them I didn't know what to do I became uh almost uh sad University the first year I was supposed to go to university on the first day that I went it's the same day that I believe in the Lord before that I I started feeling a heat it was it was something that was troubling for me but today I said amen to this message everything became normal I came to understand it was the pill of fire that was protecting me in 2017 we were coming back from we went to visit the family someone passed away we're coming back lost a brother we were coming back we were on the freeway and there was we were on the freeway in outcome City miles we were about 65 miles an hour we were talking about the word of God testimonies of healing and things like that I don't know what happened it was about past midnight about 35 minutes I just heard a loud noise I couldn't explain I was driving my car it was a Honda Pilot when I heard the noise it seemed like somebody slapped me really hard nobody has ever slept it was not the slabs it was the airbags that was coming from the doors I just I just cried

right everybody was screaming we stopped [Music] [Music] until the police came Monday they asked us if we were able to get out of the car if you can move if we could move our legs I was a little bit scared to see it I tried sadly it was it was fine they said come out if you can't and we came out the car that hit us from behind yeah there was not a single tire that remaining Place everything just

substance effects they took him to the hospital they also took us they're back outside of the slab from the airbags everything was normal freeway I want you to imagine being on the freeway we were

[Applause] foreign amen I trust you're happy to be free amen amen with my brother Andrew everyone has some of our local ministers just come and say a few words up here certainly I know the New Years means so much to us and man we just want uh to reflect on the year that passed and and put it in perspective for the year that is to come amen so pretty Andre if you could just say to you God bless you praise the Lord well since everybody's given a testimony I God has done so much you know and it's you know when you think about it it's hard to isolate it down and just reduce it down but one thing I can say as a testimony is what I have what I've experienced is by the grace of God and what's so amazing about his grace is what he's done for us to this point he's going to continue to do you know and that Grace what's so wonderful about it is you know we've accepted the hand of the Potter and we're a people that are just upon the potter's wheel and we can hold to it because there's Grace isn't that wonderful you know I was thinking about you know just I don't know how it happened but about two months ago I did something to my shoulder and it may have happened while I was asleep but my arm became useless when it had like a trigger or something and so it would just go completely dead and I couldn't really lift it and it would be like a real sharp stabbing pain and you know I need my arm for work you know and aren't you grateful that God he's promised to supply our needs so I don't have to fear though I couldn't use my arm and you just imagine it just happened at random times and it affected me for like almost a whole month but you know by God's grace you see God's power is still the same you know I can testify to you over and over and over again but see there are things that happen upon the believer are not by chance you know otherwise it would be God being a god of frustration but every single thing that we go through there's a purpose and it's not just for us but it's for the whole community that we reach to you know and and just just from the standpoint of maybe uh just looking forward to what the Lord's placed on my heart I just had a a little scripture maybe we could just stand for a moment and I'll have you turn with me just a quick scripture reading and um you know it was something that I thought was so wonderful but in Luke chapter 18 in verse Luke chapter 18 and verse um so it was the parable of the the unjust judge and there um in verse 7 it says or let's back up to six it says and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge say it and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth amen you may have your seats I just you know I I you know we had a wonderful trip to Romania and God miraculously made made a way for me in such a short time to to be able to just lay it lay aside um now this is a miracle for me because I had preconceived that I was gonna um you know have a schedule with work and things like that and so I was able to just put all of that to the side and um there's a lot of mental battles that I had to go through just even to just let go and just trust the Lord on that and and what it kind of jumping ahead but you know Faith the question is is will I find faith in the earth when I come you know and and we know that there's just a deep desire that we want to do what's pleasing to the Lord isn't that our testimony like there's a deep calling out I want and and really for the believer the only thing that really satisfies is knowing that you're doing the will of God right and so I just came to a place where I realized it's going to take God to work out everything and he miraculously did that and I ended up making a phone call to uh to the phone company and said hey I'm going to be traveling to Romania and I need I need to be able to communicate when I get there you know I need to have phone service and so my company the I use a local company and they're like well we have a third party that we use that you can buy minutes while you're away and so I go okay so I go over there and uh it's not working and I paid it just this is ten dollars not a big deal but they they sold me something that didn't exist you know it was calls from here to there not from there to here and so I was like Wow and so when I came back I was kind of like man what a bum deal you know I didn't have any ability to call back home or anything unless I had Wi-Fi hook up you know and and it just struck me that you know as I was making the phone call to my phone company I was kind of like this is this is a bad deal while I was there if I was really depending on that service it would have been a complete failure you know and so thank God you know brother Matthew has a good you know phone connection so anything I needed really was was available that way but so then uh I'm on the phone with somebody just kind of complaining like hey I'm considering moving to another phone company and all this kind of stuff well as I'm talking to him you know the guy asked me my name and different things like that and getting the information and so then he's like I'm terribly sorry but and then he explains to me that actually wasn't a service they provided they're going to refund me the money but it just so happens that the man said something that triggered something and all of a sudden we're talking about God and all of a sudden the man he's saying that God supernaturally touched him in his heart and and he said there's a presence that I just I can't explain to you but it's so real and and even as we talked I think I was on the phone for with him for 30 minutes and it was so special to me you know isn't that something that you want you want leadership you want God to reveal his will to you you want you want revelation so that you can do what's pleasing to him not only just be a blessing you know be blessed but to be a blessing to somebody else and I thought was so wonderful the man even he mistakenly called me Angelo and I guess in his tongue that means Angel and so I'm just like you know God is so special to touch people's lives that we're in contact with and here I was thinking oh this could be something kind of frustrating um but yet to see how all of these things they're pre-planned by God your life is your your your life has been pre-planned by God and so as we were going through the trip and different things I I began to realize how much God really orders our steps you know the the things that we endure the things that we've gone through God he's going to have some Overcomers and so every situation that we go through we don't have to fear God's bringing something out of us an expression of him you know and so it's it's my desire to to yield more to that and you know I I thought it was real special and you know to think that you know the question that spurred on in our conversation is you know because a lot of people in the world they they have experience with the word of God they know the Bible and it's intellectual and some of it you know some is pure and genuine but you know the the faith that God's looking for is the revelation of this hour you know and to think that you know when you look at this unjust judge and this attitude you know it's like okay consider what this unjudged though he didn't fear God though he didn't regard man because this woman kept persistently doing it I'm just gonna give it to her and so this this this story is connected will I find faith when I return and I was listening before we left something that the Lord dealt with my heart and and and I believe there's leadership in this message I believe there's personal leadership when we go into prayer we look to the word of God and we just let the Lord lead us you know and something you know I really believe with all my heart the way we serve God is to serve his people and so uh somebody had you know I was fellowshipping with somebody and and that's just I was pouring my heart out to this person and I said you know that's and so then you know how it is sometimes you want to go check yourself with what the prophet said do you ever feel like that you know I just want to make sure I don't want to lead nobody astray I want to make sure that things that are coming out of my mouth are the faith of this hour and so I go back and I'm looking and you know he says it a lot you know but this one message he said was in a message called law 1955. and so as I'm listening to it he's just in the introduction of the tape and it's just going on and he's talking about a healing service and different things and then all of a sudden you know he begins to uh excuse me so he begins to share a uh how that after a service he remembers there was a there was somebody that said hey will you pray for my baby sister and sometime it passed and he said that he ended up hearing this uh and I don't know if it was a tug on his heart or if he was an audible voice but he said something about an infant baby and it kept it kept on him you know isn't that how the Lord healed just put something on you like a little burden or you'll seem like I gotta go search this out and there's so many things that can get in the way to hinder us from searching that out you know I find for me it was like seeing what the prophet did is like he didn't just push it off to the side you know like to really find like a passion to go and see each other you know if someone really wanted gold and then there was another gold rush they would press past a lot of other things and go search it out they'll look for the treasure but the thing is is we know that we can't please God except It Be by faith and Faith cometh by hearing and what what have I been doing spending all my time doing a lot of other things that I hold this value but yet there's there's a a treasure Trove a storehouse and so as I was listening to this um this sermon it really struck me how persistent that brother Branham was he didn't just pass this voice that was saying about this infant baby and so he searched it out he went through the books and he was like okay there was a prayer request for the a baby that had you know cancer in the eyes and he was searching it out and then seemed like he didn't let it up he didn't let go of it this was pressing him and how many times are we guilty am I guilty of just passing it up you know and so but this perseverance that he showed in this in this message it just was striking my heart and so he ends up you know he ended up following through and it turns out that he ends up finding out that there was a um he remembered whose voice it was that said remember my sister my little baby sister and he said that's uh such and such he even had the name and so he then he looks up in the phone book or something it calls uh the uh the certain uh dad or Pastor or something but there was so many steps that he had to finally get to and then he's on the phone with somebody in the hospital and this baby had been given up for like 10 or 11 days it was unconscious all this kind of stuff but now he in prayer now he he knows and he call and they make contact and then he shows up after you know so many hours of prayer and different things and it was just amazing and so I'll share this because you know I think it's special whenever the Lord does stuff like that and then for brother Branham to make a comment afterwards I just thought it was so exceptional and so you know he said it's it's better to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and this is after a great Victory because he was led of the Holy Spirit he says if we Christians would only quiet ourselves see not be so much as unrushing quieten ourselves one call from the Lord means more than ten thousand of our human efforts you know and and I just think that that affected that one uh baby's life and the testimony was special and it's just an encouragement to me to know that you know in this next up and coming year I believe that you know we're drawing closer to that time and you know our Victory is the faith right and oh to overcome how can we overcome we're going to have perfect faith and so you know I I believe that God's waiting to see us and and this is the other thing too and this is kind of personal because when I looked at leaving to Romania and hearing this testimony and just seeing the hand of God leading me through the different messages and in prayer I realized what the devil has been trying to do for a while with me and I know he's doing it with you is he's trying to rob us of our sacrifice you know and and Faith you know if you don't have love mixed in with your service and your Works God can't use it and so you know it's the love of God that shed abroad in our heart to go to do the will of the Lord is to go and serve God's people and so I I realize that part of the spirit of this age is they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and that's always battering against us go get more be more do this do that and it's pressing us and it's trying to draw us and to get our eyes looking for the next feel good but I just believe that there's times the times coming where we're willing to sacrifice all because we want to do what's pleasing to the Lord and I'll say this from from my heart I I realize you know we we know that when we do something for the Lord and it's even just for one Soul you know it'd be worth it all and I've come to realize that you know like the scripture says here in um John chapter 8. you know Jesus made this statement he said in verse 29 he says and he sent and he that sent me is with me and the father hath not left me alone for I do always that which please him you know what a testimony and that same spirit is in you so the potential is in you to do that very same thing I do nothing except what pleases the father and so I just believe that there's something within us to sacrifice everything that we will do what's pleasing to him and so I'm looking forward to this new year and I'm going to persevere I know you're going to persevere because you know the devil trying to rob Moses and then to leave the sacrifice behind you know but really more than anything I want to do what's pleasing to the Lord and I believe what's pleasing to the Lord is not just having family going to work doing school that's just the background of what God wants us to do but I believe that God wants us to worship Him in spirit and in truth I want I believe that what God's looking for us is that his very spirit and his very life can do the very same Works he did when he was here amen that's my expectation that's our hope praise God the Lord bless you amen praise the Lord and Manny if we can have that expectation every day when we work up you know the prophet will say that it seems like we do so much talking and very little listening you know we do all the talking and sometimes we expect God in the Thunders and then all of those things and in the shout and the emotion but most the time he's in the still Small Voice because when he comes there that he's speaking the truth you know the emotion can carry out all kinds of things but there's still Small Voice well directory that's leadership right there amen sister yessenia has a testimony if she could come at this time amen praise God huh sorry God bless you Isa I'm really nervous I'm a testimony I'm a miracle of God when I came to this country I didn't want to know nothing about God my sister knows God from a really long time I always judge her when I came here torno my life turned it was really difficult having a beautiful family her husband the only Gods Know why he put it in my pathos two beautiful children doesn't let you see is the lord always has a purpose and I Want To Praise Him Now is when you know everything that he keeps you from the Lord put my cousin that I knew this message to live in my house I live a terrible life the Lord got me out of places terrible he saved me from Three wrecks we're two cars and nothing happened to me Prima thank to God that I had a cousin every day I came in the uh in the morning I heard it that she away from me and she always pray for me you came here safe go to sleep stop being annoying everything is fine to summarize in the last wreck I had that place I'm going with God and God save me yes I'm here thank to him I want to give the glory to God that you shouldn't stop praying because the brain always reached eat your soy um I am a miracle of those I thank God I could come to this message because I remember when I came here my crazy boy came here on Wednesday afterwards there is real Christians they only love me eat porque and now we have to thank God I'm here walking the enemy put a lot of things in my mind there's a lot of circumstances and problems in the way one of them it was the I'm not worthy to have a kid uh four losses but the lord gave me my Miracle one day I came to the altar with a pastor lady I told him I tried all I could but I'm not worthy something is wrong with me all the wrong I have done community you is living with my children and the pastor told me I never forget no no say no more yeah and love the Lord with all your heart then I went to my closet Senor I told them I know I feel you foreign foreign I want him with all my heart and there's David impossible for him and I wanna glorify him and I want to thank the Lord I know I'm not what right what I hear in the preachers but I know I'm not what I used to be because he will finish it amen man I think sometimes we forget that it took a miracle for each one of you to be in this room here's a miracle working God amen he will go to the end of the Earth Amen to bring you to his fold amen amen we're happy to have our pastor and vitamin this time to come and say a few words God bless you tonight I guess they're starting to shoot off fireworks um they don't know there's a fire to come and we're working not to be there amen I I didn't want to I don't have a lot of strength but I I just wanted to share this evening with you I'd just like to read a couple scriptures so they could put it on the board and I hope this is all of our attitude when I read the scriptures a lot I look for the attitude that the person has the approach the way that they're going forward um how that they go forward when adversity comes When Trials come when the enemy rages you still got to go forward and you've got to have a way that you go forward you might want to call it an approach or something and I want to go forward as a church don't you I think that we long to see the supernatural that we have in our midst go beyond these walls and go out to a world that really needs it you know we don't know how many lives are affected when people ask us to pray form but I'd like to read here in Philippians the third chapter and it's a beautiful chapter I'd like to have read it all but I just want to start with the 13th verse talking about our attitude for the new year and we always use the new year as a time to drive a stake and to say that we're going to make things different and of course we don't believe in turning new leaves we believe in living new lives but I I love Paul's approach here and I just would like this to be our approach for the New Years brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind reaching forth unto those things which are before and I believe there's something before us we haven't apprehended it we haven't achieved it but I'm going to leave those things which are behind behind especially the things that I wish I'd never done or I wish I would have never said because they're never going to do me any good my failures cannot be in the building I'm going to build tomorrow it can't be part of the material that's got to be in my mind to approach the battle in athletes and great Sportsmen and great uh people who have achieved things in the athletic and different Realms they've always said one thing you've got to leave what you just did behind one of the Great baseball picture pictures made this statement one time I never let the last pitch I threw ever affect the pitch that I'm going to throw so when we come to this time I believe it's time that we sure we haven't apprehended we haven't achieved everything that we want it to be uh there's things that we don't like but there's one thing certain I'm going to leave those things which are behind behind I'm going to leave them they're over if they're placed under the blood they're thrown in Sea of God's forgiveness and I love this attitude he says Brethren I count myself to not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth to those things which are before I hope you all have something before you that you're reaching for a sweeter spirit in my own personal self I want to mind that recognizes the Lord recognizes needs recognizes the move of the spirit I want to be more in tune more acute more in harmony uh with the body and with one another and with the word in the will of the Lord I believe there's something that lies before us I don't want to go by myself I want to go with you amen I want to apprehend together as a body and as individuals in Polk sums it up he says I leave and I and I reach for those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus we have a high calling can you think of the higher calling than to be called the bride of Christ can you think of a higher calling to be the those that have been chosen to manifest the word of God in this hour can you think of a higher calling then to be the last sign that this Dying World wherever get the last voice that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you don't I just came back from my mother in California and and I I I I see a Dying World I I see a a new a new Jesus that's put forth and a a a new approach to life and all those things but there's got to be somebody that stands up that says that he's the same yesterday today and forever and so let us let us realize that there's a higher calling in Christ Jesus for us all we haven't obtained it we haven't apprehended it but we're going to leave those things that are behind behind and we're going to reach for that Higher Calling we're going to press for that higher mark until we've come to the High Calling in the Lord Jesus each of you have been called each of you possess a calling and I pray for you that this next year that your calling would become more clear to you that your position in the body would become more real to you that your value as a member of the body because each member's fitted and joined together that you will realize that we can't make it without you that you're important that nobody can take your place and we need one another to run this race to fight this fight I'd hate to get to heaven and be there alone I want to have Fellowship I want to rejoice and so I I trust tonight I'm sure brother Billy will prepare for communion uh Forest whatever he has planned for this service but I just want us to in our hearts to realize we don't need to look back God's fixing to do something let's press for that calling that's the love of God to be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit let's grow more in the unity and love and I believe the Holy Spirit the power of God to make every promise come to pass will rest on your lives will give you joy and peace that we will reign together with him in eternity may this be the year of his coming even so come quickly Lord Jesus God bless you I love you amen [Applause] amen amen that's what we look forward to amen the writers will go get communion what we'll do is they'll bring it out here we'll have everybody come and you you'll take the bread and you'll take the communion but don't take it yet we'll try to have as many all of us take it at the same time so you take it you keep it you walk back to your chair and then we'll take it all together so don't remember don't take it yet just hold it go back
