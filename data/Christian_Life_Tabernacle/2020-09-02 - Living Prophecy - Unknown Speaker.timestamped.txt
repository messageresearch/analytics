[39:57] you said that you would provide for us
[40:02] you said a righteous man would never beg

[40:14] the things that come
[40:15] our way you have a reason
[40:19] for all things father you have a reason

[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] oh lord if we could become conscious of
[40:39] our eternal being
[40:41] of our eternal outcome
[40:44] not be so captured by a present fleeting
[40:48] world
[40:48] that days are numbered
[40:53] we've come here this evening to just
[40:56] be built up in in you and to lift you up
[41:00] that you could draw us nigh unto you
[41:04] father each request that's on the heart
[41:07] of the believer this evening

[41:26] knowing that you're kind and gracious
[41:32] and we lay our requests at your throne

[41:38] them to you
[41:40] we ask you now to be our portion in
[41:43] jesus
[41:43] precious name we pray amen
[41:47] amen god bless you tonight let's turn in
[41:49] our bibles real quick
[41:51] over to malachi and read a little
[41:54] scripture and just going to have a time
[41:56] of
[41:56] a fellowship this evening and and
[42:01] and as
[42:05] peter would say we want to stir up our
[42:08] our faith and our pure minds by
[42:11] way of remembrance and
[42:15] uh just uh
[42:19] uh it's always good to go back
[42:22] and and know your purpose and and
[42:26] what it is we're doing here and why that
[42:28] we're here and
[42:30] and
[42:33] why that were chosen and elected so
[42:35] let's read this great scripture
[42:37] found in malachi the fourth chapter and
[42:40] the fifth
[42:41] verse and
[42:47] and in malachi 4 and 5 it says behold
[42:52] i will send you elijah the prophet
[42:56] before the coming of the great and
[43:00] dreadful
[43:01] day of the lord and he shall turn
[43:05] the hearts of the fathers to the
[43:09] children
[43:10] and the hearts of the children to their
[43:13] fathers
[43:14] lest i come and smite the earth
[43:18] with the curse heavenly father we ask
[43:21] you to
[43:22] bless your word to us in your precious
[43:24] name we pray
[43:26] amen amen god bless you
[43:29] you may certainly be seated
[43:33] tonight we know that um
[43:43] the promises that we live in today
[43:46] that god promised us
[43:50] to send a a
[43:53] message or a prophet to this age and
[43:58] and as we heard that and we
[44:01] watched it and we focused on it
[44:05] we begin to see that god truly
[44:07] vindicated
[44:09] that this messenger was
[44:12] a messenger sent from god and it was the
[44:15] fulfillment
[44:16] of scripture and so
[44:20] and we realized that
[44:23] there was a purpose that god had
[44:28] in sending a prophet
[44:31] for one because the prophet's especial
[44:35] made person he's built a certain way
[44:39] he's he has uh a way about him
[44:43] that that god made him that god could
[44:46] speak to him and move him
[44:48] he has a a built-in
[44:51] uh uh i don't want to wish i had a
[44:55] uh better vocabulary
[44:58] but he has a resistance built
[45:02] in in him to the
[45:05] uh influences of man
[45:08] and of the world there's a way that he's
[45:11] made
[45:11] that he's kept separate so that
[45:14] god can speak to him he's
[45:18] got an acute sense
[45:21] for uh the spirit
[45:24] and and and because of that
[45:29] gift in the way that he's made
[45:32] god can use him to deliver
[45:36] a message or what we would call
[45:39] a prophecy we
[45:42] oftentimes refer to this as the message
[45:46] of the hour
[45:47] but i sincerely believe that we could
[45:50] call it
[45:51] the prophecy of the hour
[45:55] that that god was prophesying
[45:58] and and speaking of things that are
[46:02] soon to be it wasn't just
[46:05] a a message like something that
[46:08] we would gather a fact or
[46:11] we would gather some information
[46:15] and then the information was given to us
[46:18] that we could make decisions
[46:23] and we need those messages those are
[46:25] good
[46:27] you get a lot of messages in the mail
[46:30] you get a lot of messages nowadays on
[46:32] your phone
[46:33] uh people call you up i just got a
[46:37] message today that
[46:38] one of you stayed at the marriott hotel
[46:41] and
[46:42] because one of you stayed there they
[46:43] wanted to give me a free vacation
[46:46] because you must have given them my name
[46:50] and i i thank you for that but i'm
[46:54] really not interested in and uh
[46:57] something that's free from a place that
[47:00] i've always had to pay
[47:03] there's got to be there's got to be a
[47:06] catch somewhere
[47:08] and so but we're not talking and and
[47:10] i'll just want to lay this down just a
[47:12] little bit tonight as we just have a
[47:14] little bit of
[47:15] of fellowship so we're not talking about
[47:18] a message that was a message of fact
[47:23] or of information we're talking about a
[47:26] message that's a message of prophecy
[47:29] in other words they've told us of things
[47:32] that were going to be
[47:33] it told us of the conditions that were
[47:36] coming
[47:37] it told us of what to expect it told us
[47:41] of the decline
[47:42] it told us of a decline of morals
[47:46] and the decline of man it told us of the
[47:49] conditions
[47:50] and atmosphere that would start to
[47:53] surround us
[47:54] okay it wasn't a message of fact it was
[47:58] a message of eyesight
[48:00] it was a light it shall be light
[48:03] in the evening time it was the message
[48:06] so that the path to glory you shall
[48:09] surely find
[48:11] that the message and the prophecy was
[48:14] sent
[48:15] that the son of perdition could be
[48:17] revealed
[48:18] and that the enemy would be would be
[48:21] uh exposed in every one of his
[48:25] tricks and and that's what a
[48:28] overcomer is an overcomer is someone
[48:31] that recognizes the enemy
[48:33] in every one of his tricks and
[48:36] if you didn't have the prophecy of the
[48:40] trick
[48:41] or the prophecy of the deception
[48:44] then you would never perceive it
[48:48] or look at it and sometimes that's what
[48:51] we've been talking about
[48:53] is we can't let the message become what
[48:56] we call
[48:56] academia or or a bible
[49:00] study so to speak or or just
[49:03] study in the history of it we have to
[49:06] understand that the message that was
[49:08] sent for us
[49:09] and stored up for us was living prophecy
[49:13] just like the old testament those
[49:15] prophets
[49:16] they prophesied and they prophesied and
[49:19] they prophesied
[49:20] in the scribes and everybody wrote them
[49:22] down and
[49:23] they referred back to them but they
[49:25] never understood them
[49:27] as something that one day had to come to
[49:30] pass
[49:31] and that's what jesus rebuked them for
[49:33] he said
[49:34] you search the scriptures because in
[49:36] them you think they have
[49:38] you have eternal life but they are which
[49:41] have been
[49:42] testifying of me
[49:45] and so we have a great witness so great
[49:49] a cloud of witness
[49:51] around us because we've seen the things
[49:54] that have prophesied
[49:56] come to pass so many things that we've
[49:59] noticed lately
[50:01] when we go back and read we almost
[50:04] are astounded because there they're
[50:07] spoken and there they're spoken
[50:09] many times we've sat together uh here in
[50:12] the assembly
[50:13] and we've played a a portion of
[50:16] of something that brother branham had
[50:18] preached and it seems so revel
[50:20] uh relevant to the moment that we're in
[50:24] it's so descriptive
[50:26] of where that we are so
[50:30] not only was he describing the time
[50:34] and prophesying of the time and
[50:37] of the condition and of the world
[50:40] at the same time he was also prophesying
[50:43] of a church he was prophesying of a
[50:47] believer
[50:48] he was prophesying of sons and daughters
[50:51] that would
[50:52] come upon the scene he was prophesying
[50:56] of what uh of what that he would have
[51:00] formed he said in the lady osea age he
[51:04] says
[51:04] behold i stand at the door and knock.
[51:08] if any man opens it up i will come in
[51:11] with him
[51:12] and i'll sup with him and i'll eat the
[51:14] evening meal with him
[51:16] in other words i will break bread with
[51:19] him
[51:20] and he is the bread that came down from
[51:23] heaven
[51:24] so can you base so he's saying if if you
[51:27] open up
[51:28] and you enter into this fellowship with
[51:30] me i will share
[51:32] myself with you amen that's what
[51:35] communion
[51:36] is he says my uh it's
[51:39] it's meat indeed and and bread indeed
[51:43] it's
[51:43] life the word of life so the very
[51:46] communion that he promises
[51:49] is the communion of himself with you
[51:53] and he prophesied of a union
[51:56] he prophesied of a union that would take
[51:59] place
[52:00] an invisible union it's not
[52:03] invisible to us it's only invisible to
[52:07] the unbeliever
[52:08] in other words it was an invisible union
[52:12] to those
[52:13] that didn't recognize it or didn't know
[52:15] the day
[52:16] or didn't know the hour do you know
[52:18] jesus was invisible
[52:20] to the scribes and pharisees
[52:24] he was invisible to them they didn't see
[52:27] him as being the son of god they didn't
[52:31] see him act as being the savior
[52:34] they didn't see him as as having
[52:37] resurrection life and
[52:39] that he was going to pay the price at
[52:41] calvary
[52:42] in order that this eternal life that he
[52:46] possessed that could now be transferred
[52:49] and shared with man that they could rise
[52:52] to they didn't see it
[52:54] the messenger said if they would have
[52:56] seen it they would not have crucified
[52:59] him
[53:00] but they were blinded to him and
[53:03] and that's what the scripture said their
[53:05] eyes were blinded
[53:06] in this case man's blind miserable
[53:10] poor wretched and naked so in other
[53:12] words this union
[53:14] that's fixing to take place between the
[53:17] the the christ the uh the savior
[53:20] the the son of god the second adam
[53:24] and this union that he is going to have
[53:27] with this eve is prophesied
[53:31] but yet it's invisible
[53:35] you can't show somebody something that
[53:38] they don't see the scripture says can
[53:41] the blind
[53:42] uh lead the blind won't they
[53:46] both fall in the ditch so
[53:49] they don't know but it's it's given to
[53:52] you
[53:53] they asked jesus why do you speak in
[53:55] riddles why do you speak in parables he
[53:57] says
[53:58] because it's not given to them to know
[54:00] these things
[54:01] he says that with their lips they do
[54:04] worship me
[54:05] but their hearts are are far from me
[54:09] and so we find that today so again
[54:12] we say this because it's important to us
[54:16] that we understand
[54:17] the privilege that we are participating
[54:21] in
[54:21] and and what it is that's been
[54:24] prophesied
[54:26] to us that we're going to be a partaker
[54:29] of
[54:30] because it not only did it prophesy the
[54:32] con
[54:33] condition of the world but it and the
[54:35] positioning of the world
[54:37] it also prophesied of the positioning
[54:40] of the bride and the message of the hour
[54:44] came to position the bride into a
[54:47] condition
[54:49] and into a place that made them
[54:52] uh ready and and
[54:56] and able i like that word and
[54:59] able to participate in
[55:02] a transformation from this life
[55:06] to the next
[55:12] and and it had to be we read the quotes
[55:16] uh to a sunday morning that that
[55:19] it's that the church has got to pull
[55:21] itself
[55:22] up into faith
[55:25] and so we we looked that that
[55:29] there there had to be a restoration
[55:34] of faith now
[55:38] when we talk about a restoration
[55:42] of faith this statement
[55:45] moved on my heart for the next few
[55:48] minutes as we just
[55:49] fellowship because this faith
[55:52] is prophesied to you
[55:58] i will restore saith the lord
[56:02] i will restore back the faith of the
[56:05] fathers
[56:06] the hearts of the fathers i'm going to
[56:08] give
[56:09] this the children of this gospel the
[56:12] children
[56:12] of the ministry of elijah
[56:16] i am going to give them this same
[56:19] faith that the fathers had
[56:23] the faith that said silver and gold have
[56:26] i
[56:26] none but that which i have i give
[56:30] to you the faith that that wrote the
[56:33] book of acts
[56:35] the faith that saw the spirit move uh
[56:38] upon cornelius and elk and saw the
[56:41] spirit move
[56:42] upon the centurion that that saw the
[56:46] the spirit of god through
[56:49] the words of men produce
[56:54] wonderful results
[56:58] and so we realized
[57:02] that this faith that uh
[57:05] is it is being restored to us
[57:10] that it's given to us to understand
[57:14] faith in a different light
[57:18] than it it's been perceived
[57:21] before it faith so many
[57:24] many times it's it is something that we
[57:28] struggle to get
[57:30] because we don't understand it but
[57:33] you you are believers
[57:37] and so we want to talk just a few little
[57:40] things about faith tonight and uh
[57:44] uh just to make it uh
[57:48] encourage us is the the word
[57:51] that we say because satan always wants
[57:54] to tell us
[57:55] we don't have faith
[58:00] because with faith
[58:04] all things are possible
[58:08] and he also always wants
[58:12] us to think that there's something that
[58:17] we have to uh produce
[58:21] and it the prophet of god talks about
[58:25] uh a farmer that went out
[58:29] and he takes a seed and he
[58:33] takes the corn seed or what seed it
[58:35] might be
[58:37] and he plants it and
[58:40] and he he he sits there and he plants
[58:43] the seed
[58:44] he says now he doesn't go out
[58:48] the next day and dig it back up
[58:53] to see if it started to grow
[58:57] he he doesn't go back and and dig it
[59:00] up to find out if uh
[59:03] if it's got any uh
[59:06] sprouts or or anything he
[59:10] lets the seed do
[59:13] its work
[59:17] you understand so the word of god will
[59:19] do
[59:20] what it said it would do you've just got
[59:23] to
[59:24] let it do its work because
[59:27] it's a promise so in other words god
[59:30] said that he'd call out a people he'd
[59:33] separate
[59:34] out a people he said he'd restore back
[59:37] the faith of the fathers
[59:39] to them you can't take that seed and
[59:42] hurry it along
[59:46] you can't take it up and open it up and
[59:48] say i know you're in there hurry up come
[59:49] out
[59:51] you can't sit out there in the field
[59:53] with a picture and
[59:54] pour in water and a hair dryer and
[59:58] you're gonna make it know if the seed is
[1:00:01] built in the power of transformation
[1:00:04] is in that seed if it if it's just
[1:00:08] let it do its work and
[1:00:11] so you have to understand that the
[1:00:13] message of the hour
[1:00:14] was a seed it was given
[1:00:19] to you it was it's a free gift of god
[1:00:23] that was given to you the preacher can't
[1:00:25] make it work
[1:00:26] he can't force you up to a higher ground
[1:00:29] he can't do
[1:00:30] it's going to work just exactly
[1:00:32] according to god's time
[1:00:34] it is not going to fail god's word is
[1:00:38] not
[1:00:38] going to fail every promise that he's
[1:00:42] spoken
[1:00:43] will come to pass
[1:00:46] so you have to understand faith
[1:00:51] is something that moves now
[1:00:54] i'd like to this statement it struck me
[1:00:57] it said
[1:01:01] and if i could read it here he says
[1:01:06] he says i am that i am he knew
[1:01:11] with that perfect faith that he was the
[1:01:14] anointed messiah
[1:01:16] that the spirit of god was upon him
[1:01:20] he said now i in myself
[1:01:23] do nothing but it's my faith in god
[1:01:27] and god was in him the word
[1:01:31] made manifest and when the word of god
[1:01:35] comes in you
[1:01:38] it's made manifest now
[1:01:41] understand this when the word of god
[1:01:44] comes in you
[1:01:45] it's made manifest as you
[1:01:49] are a believer now
[1:01:53] we get so far ahead of the program
[1:01:58] when the word of god came in you
[1:02:02] right then that was a manifestation
[1:02:07] of a promise it didn't mean the word of
[1:02:10] god would come in you
[1:02:12] and now you're going to do all these
[1:02:13] works and all these works and all these
[1:02:16] things
[1:02:16] the very fact that the word came to you
[1:02:20] was a fulfillment of prophecy
[1:02:23] it was a manifestation my
[1:02:26] sheep hear my voice another they won't
[1:02:29] follow
[1:02:30] all that the father hath given me will
[1:02:33] come
[1:02:34] blessed are the ears of those that hear
[1:02:37] the truth
[1:02:38] look when the word came to you and the
[1:02:41] lord came
[1:02:42] into your life that was a manifestation
[1:02:46] that was a planting of a seed that meant
[1:02:49] that that seed was
[1:02:50] now going to continually work towards
[1:02:53] what it was planted for
[1:02:57] and so he goes on to say this it's
[1:03:00] manifest
[1:03:01] as you are a believer see a believer
[1:03:06] is the faith of god
[1:03:10] that moves in you now
[1:03:13] this is something that i think that is
[1:03:16] so important
[1:03:18] that we comprehend faith
[1:03:21] is not a stationary
[1:03:25] belief
[1:03:28] it's not stationary another
[1:03:33] i believe this and i believe
[1:03:36] this and i believe this and i believe
[1:03:40] this
[1:03:41] this is what we believe that was the
[1:03:43] curse
[1:03:44] of dogmas and doctrine
[1:03:48] it became a stationary belief i said
[1:03:51] this is what we believe we don't look
[1:03:53] here and say i believe
[1:03:55] that uh william branham was a prophet of
[1:03:59] god and
[1:04:00] and that belief stays there in
[1:04:03] history as a stationary belief
[1:04:07] no because it was more than that because
[1:04:10] the spirit
[1:04:11] that manifested the message is the same
[1:04:14] spirit that manifests the believer
[1:04:18] if it's a faith is something that moves
[1:04:21] it's it's not a concept that's
[1:04:25] agreed upon
[1:04:29] faith moves it it moves
[1:04:33] and the reason it moves is because
[1:04:37] it moves to manifest
[1:04:41] it it moves it moves to fulfill
[1:04:45] all the word of god is promise
[1:04:51] all the word of god is promise it's the
[1:04:53] promised
[1:04:54] word of god it's the promise of a
[1:04:57] resurrection
[1:04:58] it's a promise of the kingdom is a
[1:05:01] promise of a deliverance it's the
[1:05:03] promise of healing
[1:05:04] it's everything that god said that he
[1:05:07] would do
[1:05:08] it it's a word of promise i promise you
[1:05:11] i promise you i promise you i'll not
[1:05:14] leave you
[1:05:15] nor forsake you but i'll come again i
[1:05:17] promise you i'll send a comforter
[1:05:20] i promise that i'll be there i promise
[1:05:23] you a spirit
[1:05:24] that will bring you into remembrance and
[1:05:26] the art take no thought for what you say
[1:05:29] for the spirit will be there to help you
[1:05:31] its promise its promise its promise its
[1:05:34] promise
[1:05:36] and that's what peter said he said by
[1:05:38] these exceedingly great and precious
[1:05:40] promises
[1:05:42] we are partakers of divine nature
[1:05:48] it's moving it gets
[1:05:51] moving faith is
[1:05:54] the the the belief
[1:06:00] he says he says and a believer
[1:06:03] is the faith of god
[1:06:06] that moves in you it's
[1:06:09] god moving in you to fulfill
[1:06:14] what was prophesied of you
[1:06:17] did you know your deliverance is
[1:06:19] prophesied you're an overcomer
[1:06:23] you might battle lust in this lustful
[1:06:25] world
[1:06:26] you you might battle against the styles
[1:06:29] and the
[1:06:30] the way that the peop women are dressed
[1:06:32] and
[1:06:33] and the things that are out there you
[1:06:35] might battle against music because
[1:06:37] it's designed to to catch that emotional
[1:06:40] beat
[1:06:41] you might battle against all kinds of
[1:06:44] things
[1:06:46] but you don't measure yourself by the
[1:06:49] things that you're battling
[1:06:51] you measure yourself by the promise to
[1:06:54] overcome
[1:06:59] you measure yourself by the spirit of
[1:07:02] god that's
[1:07:03] moving in you to fulfill
[1:07:06] that overcoming
[1:07:10] remember faith moves
[1:07:13] it's not stationary
[1:07:16] it's not a belief
[1:07:21] it's a moving being
[1:07:26] it's the spirit that moves in you
[1:07:31] to fulfill the prophecy
[1:07:36] that god spoke of you
[1:07:41] you were with him in the beginning your
[1:07:43] name was written on the lamb's book of
[1:07:45] life
[1:07:46] i love this promise i go to prepare a
[1:07:48] place for you
[1:07:51] if it were not so i would not tell you
[1:07:55] i would not prophesy for you so if i
[1:07:58] go to prepare a place for you i will
[1:08:01] come again
[1:08:02] and receive you that where i am
[1:08:05] you may be also that's a promise
[1:08:11] now how does god fulfill that promise
[1:08:15] he fulfills that promise by sending his
[1:08:18] spirit
[1:08:21] which his word and his spirit are the
[1:08:23] same
[1:08:24] thing just the devil that tried to chop
[1:08:28] him up
[1:08:31] and that worked moving in you
[1:08:35] to fulfill that promise because
[1:08:39] somebody has got to fulfill that
[1:08:44] let me tell you it's not word
[1:08:47] till it comes to pass
[1:08:52] you say wait a minute
[1:08:57] he said let there be light
[1:09:01] right so when that was manifested
[1:09:05] now we knew what that light was
[1:09:09] it's got to come to pass it's got to
[1:09:13] manifest
[1:09:15] that faith has got to manifest faith is
[1:09:17] a gift of god
[1:09:19] lift any of us through both faith isn't
[1:09:21] he isn't
[1:09:22] brought on by what we do faith is given
[1:09:25] to us
[1:09:26] so you can understand that the minute
[1:09:28] that that word
[1:09:30] came in you the minute that word came to
[1:09:34] you that was the beginning of the
[1:09:37] manifestation
[1:09:38] of the prophecy concerning you
[1:09:45] you could have been as dark as a goose
[1:09:49] lost is all get out
[1:09:53] because the scripture says you didn't
[1:09:55] choose me
[1:09:57] i chose you you didn't seek me
[1:10:00] i sought you look the minute that he
[1:10:03] sought you
[1:10:05] the minute he started dealing with your
[1:10:07] heart
[1:10:08] that was a manifestation
[1:10:11] of the word of god my sheep know my
[1:10:14] voice another they won't follow
[1:10:16] he was moving so that was the faith of
[1:10:19] god
[1:10:20] moving it wasn't okay
[1:10:25] now i i believe he was a savior i
[1:10:27] believe in some stationary
[1:10:30] bible no wonder this
[1:10:34] the word of god said the letter killeth
[1:10:37] because the letter is stationary
[1:10:42] right isn't that what you call a letter
[1:10:45] it's put on what
[1:10:48] stationary see my whole message is
[1:10:50] vindicated
[1:10:55] no you understand it's not stationary
[1:10:58] that's not what we believe in we don't
[1:11:00] believe in a dead letter
[1:11:02] we don't believe in a in a in the
[1:11:05] doctrines
[1:11:06] we don't believe in crude creeds we
[1:11:08] don't believe in something that's spoken
[1:11:10] and laid there's dead we believe in a
[1:11:13] resurrected
[1:11:14] spirit which is the spirit of jesus
[1:11:17] christ
[1:11:18] alive in our presence moving in our life
[1:11:22] to fulfill what he has prophesied
[1:11:25] and spoken of and i believe he's here
[1:11:30] doing that in the hearts of his elect
[1:11:33] [Music]
[1:11:36] now you might resist it
[1:11:42] but it won't be for long
[1:11:46] you might resist it and you might get
[1:11:49] some chastisement
[1:11:52] but he's not going to lose
[1:11:56] one all that the father
[1:11:59] hath given me will come
[1:12:02] because we understand that faith is
[1:12:06] something that moves
[1:12:09] and then he says if we just read a
[1:12:11] little bit he said
[1:12:12] he knew who he was therefore he had
[1:12:15] faith
[1:12:16] faith could produce faith
[1:12:19] could produce when he knew
[1:12:23] what he was now if ye abide in me
[1:12:27] and my words abide in you then you know
[1:12:29] who you are
[1:12:31] ask what you will and it will be given
[1:12:34] to you now
[1:12:38] so we're we're talking about this moving
[1:12:41] faith how many understand what i'm
[1:12:44] trying to say
[1:12:45] this is a moving faith faith is the
[1:12:48] spirit
[1:12:49] moving faith is a revelation
[1:12:53] faith is the revelation of the spirit
[1:12:56] moving
[1:12:57] look in other words if you're sick
[1:13:00] can you and you read the promise of god
[1:13:03] and you know that god's a healer and
[1:13:07] that quickens you what you've got to
[1:13:09] recognize
[1:13:10] is not the substance not the
[1:13:14] stationary promise you've got to make
[1:13:18] witness and understand the spirit
[1:13:21] that's moving to bring that promise to
[1:13:24] pass
[1:13:26] that spirit's here to bring that to pass
[1:13:29] in me
[1:13:32] but as long as we're looking at old
[1:13:35] promises
[1:13:39] instead of resurrected promises
[1:13:43] i i i heard a commercial today
[1:13:47] damn it it it it just struck me it
[1:13:51] it it put me in mind of
[1:13:54] what that was on my heart yeah the
[1:13:58] commercial
[1:13:59] said thompson party of four
[1:14:04] and it was somebody in a restaurant
[1:14:07] calling out for people to come in and
[1:14:10] eat
[1:14:12] and the advertisement was those are the
[1:14:14] old days
[1:14:18] you know and that's and you can't look
[1:14:20] at the promises of god
[1:14:22] as something that's in the past
[1:14:25] the promise is nothing without the
[1:14:28] spirit
[1:14:29] bringing it to pass
[1:14:33] god promised in the scripture
[1:14:37] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30
[1:14:41] revelations 10 7 we saw the spirit
[1:14:44] move and bring that to pass
[1:14:49] and so when when we begin to look
[1:14:52] at a spirit that's moving
[1:14:56] a faith that's moving if it's not
[1:14:59] something it's moving in you
[1:15:01] it's moving in you to get you to a place
[1:15:04] it's moving in you to perfect you
[1:15:06] it's moving in you to prepare you for a
[1:15:08] rapture
[1:15:09] it's moving in you to move out the
[1:15:12] unbelief
[1:15:13] that spirit of faith is working from god
[1:15:15] it's the spirit of god moving you
[1:15:17] sometimes that spirit corrects you
[1:15:22] praise god
[1:15:26] i recognize that as being the moving
[1:15:28] spirit
[1:15:29] the moving spirit of god is
[1:15:32] faith god does
[1:15:36] nothing without
[1:15:39] faith
[1:15:43] faith the only way that god accomplishes
[1:15:46] anything so in other words god
[1:15:49] only accomplishes things by his spirit
[1:15:54] moving
[1:15:57] so now we we we talk about
[1:16:01] substance of faith so if we know that
[1:16:04] faith is the spirit moving
[1:16:11] then how does that become
[1:16:14] a substance to me
[1:16:19] if you're being convicted
[1:16:23] by the spirit that's the spirit
[1:16:27] moving on you to bring you to
[1:16:32] repentance
[1:16:35] to correct you
[1:16:39] that it's done by the spirit
[1:16:43] so he makes this statement here
[1:16:48] he says now this same bible is the same
[1:16:52] god's word so this bible's
[1:16:56] the same god's word in other words this
[1:16:58] the word of god's been the same
[1:17:01] through every age
[1:17:04] it's been if men's eyes were opened
[1:17:10] and it was god's timing in the days of
[1:17:14] justification the days of sanctification
[1:17:17] in the days of restoration of the gift
[1:17:19] man would have come but god
[1:17:21] allowed in this day for the
[1:17:24] i sav to come upon the believer
[1:17:27] that they would see the spirit
[1:17:31] of god present
[1:17:34] with his church moving
[1:17:37] them to rapturing condition
[1:17:43] they would understand that the word of
[1:17:45] god the spirit of god
[1:17:48] is coming now to fulfill what was
[1:17:51] prophesied to the believer in this age
[1:17:55] the spirit's moving so he says this the
[1:17:58] same bible
[1:18:00] is the same god's word
[1:18:04] everybody read malachi 4 5.
[1:18:08] everybody had an interpretation of it
[1:18:11] but one day
[1:18:12] the spirit moved
[1:18:16] and we saw that spirit moving in flesh
[1:18:19] and because that spirit moved in flesh
[1:18:22] that
[1:18:23] same spirit that was moving on the
[1:18:27] prophesier with the same spirit
[1:18:31] that moved on you to receive the
[1:18:34] prophecy
[1:18:38] you couldn't have two spirits different
[1:18:41] spirits working
[1:18:42] it had to be the same spirit so before
[1:18:46] there could be a message there had to be
[1:18:48] a hearer
[1:18:51] before there could be a shepherd there
[1:18:53] had to be somebody to shepherd
[1:18:56] before that there could ever been a
[1:18:57] bride there had to be a lamb's book of
[1:18:59] life
[1:19:03] look he said it's the same word and when
[1:19:07] you
[1:19:08] can receive the substance
[1:19:12] that perfect faith the substance
[1:19:16] that this promise that god
[1:19:20] made is yours
[1:19:23] now what is the substance
[1:19:27] you can't look past the spirit
[1:19:30] the substance is you
[1:19:34] taking ownership of the promise
[1:19:38] that's the substance of faith
[1:19:41] taking ownership
[1:19:44] you know excuse me
[1:19:47] my eyes really got open to that
[1:19:50] when when uh you know well
[1:19:54] brother jackson helped me uh to see that
[1:19:57] understanding of what it means to take
[1:20:00] ownership
[1:20:01] because every time we meet he's got a
[1:20:03] list of things he wants people to take
[1:20:05] ownership
[1:20:06] of so somebody's supposed to have the
[1:20:09] ownership of the baptistry
[1:20:12] they're supposed to wash it and clean it
[1:20:14] and keep it filled
[1:20:15] so somebody owns that
[1:20:18] they've taken ownership of that they've
[1:20:20] heard the message they've heard the word
[1:20:22] they understand that's their
[1:20:24] responsibility they take
[1:20:26] ownership of that somebody else takes
[1:20:28] ownership of this and
[1:20:29] somebody takes ownership of that
[1:20:34] in others it becomes your responsibility
[1:20:37] you take ownership the substance of
[1:20:40] faith
[1:20:40] is taking ownership
[1:20:44] of the promised word
[1:20:48] not not always for miracles
[1:20:52] you know he never said i come to restore
[1:20:54] back the miracles
[1:20:58] he came back to restore back the
[1:21:00] ownership
[1:21:01] of the word of god
[1:21:05] you've got to take ownership of it
[1:21:09] you're not going to drive a car that you
[1:21:11] don't take ownership of
[1:21:14] or any other example we could use
[1:21:17] understand that
[1:21:19] the substance of faith because when you
[1:21:22] take
[1:21:22] ownership you you you say the substance
[1:21:27] that this promise that god made
[1:21:30] is yours the substance is
[1:21:34] that the promise that god made
[1:21:37] is yours you take ownership
[1:21:40] of that problem promise and when you
[1:21:43] take
[1:21:44] ownership of that promise the spirit of
[1:21:48] god
[1:21:48] comes to to move to fulfill that
[1:21:53] because you've accepted as prophecy
[1:21:59] right prophecy says this will happen
[1:22:04] so when you take ownership of that you
[1:22:07] it becomes the substance of it
[1:22:09] you begin to take ownership he says
[1:22:12] watch
[1:22:13] now he said to us if ye abide in me
[1:22:17] and my word abide in you in other words
[1:22:20] you've taken ownership of it
[1:22:24] i now take this promise to be mine
[1:22:29] now you say well wait a minute that's
[1:22:32] that seed
[1:22:34] you don't go see if it's working
[1:22:38] you don't go see where the results are
[1:22:40] you let
[1:22:41] it take its course
[1:22:45] you let the spirit of god bring it to
[1:22:48] pass
[1:22:49] you leave it alone you've taken
[1:22:52] ownership of it you've planted it
[1:22:56] just like when you plant that flower
[1:22:58] just like when you plant that something
[1:23:00] in your garden
[1:23:01] you plant it and you know that that
[1:23:05] seed has been created from god
[1:23:08] that in its time in season it's going to
[1:23:11] break forth and create a vine
[1:23:13] and have squash or watermelon or
[1:23:16] tomatoes or whatever
[1:23:20] the minute you planted it
[1:23:24] you accepted the result
[1:23:29] you took ownership of it and when you
[1:23:32] accept the seed of god in your heart and
[1:23:35] you take ownership that this promise is
[1:23:38] mine
[1:23:39] that promise within itself by the spirit
[1:23:42] of god
[1:23:43] will produce all you have to do is take
[1:23:47] ownership
[1:23:48] that's the substance this is mine
[1:23:54] he says that's your position then you
[1:23:57] can ask what you will
[1:23:59] it'll be done then recognize your
[1:24:02] position in the scripture
[1:24:03] as a believer recognize
[1:24:07] you've got to recognize your position as
[1:24:10] he recognized
[1:24:12] his position now you must believe
[1:24:16] what you asked for if you are a believer
[1:24:21] recognize yourself as a believer
[1:24:24] recognize
[1:24:25] that these things are for
[1:24:29] you
[1:24:32] you don't have to know the results
[1:24:37] you don't have to figure it out
[1:24:40] you don't have to have any signs or
[1:24:43] manifestations
[1:24:45] you don't have to be on a time clock
[1:24:49] you simply have taken the ownership of
[1:24:52] it
[1:24:54] that's the substance
[1:24:58] because it's not a
[1:25:01] stationary gospel
[1:25:05] once you take the seed the
[1:25:08] transformation
[1:25:10] of that seed is a moving spirit
[1:25:14] in your life it begins to move towards
[1:25:19] the promise
[1:25:22] sometimes it's got to take weeds out of
[1:25:24] your life
[1:25:26] sometimes it's got to take unbelief out
[1:25:28] but you understand
[1:25:29] once that you see that word and you see
[1:25:32] that promise
[1:25:33] first of all the spirit the word comes
[1:25:36] to you
[1:25:38] that's the first manifestation
[1:25:43] faith comes by hearing
[1:25:46] hearing by the word of god you hear it
[1:25:50] you don't produce it you
[1:25:54] accept it you take ownership
[1:25:57] you say i accept this promise that it
[1:26:00] pertains to me
[1:26:02] now let it the spirit
[1:26:06] have its way let it move
[1:26:09] it will move it will do what he said he
[1:26:12] would do
[1:26:13] it cannot fail it can it
[1:26:17] it'll happen
[1:26:20] you don't you don't have to look
[1:26:23] for results you just have to
[1:26:28] know that you've taken possession
[1:26:31] you've got to know that faith is a
[1:26:34] moving spirit
[1:26:35] is not a stationary object
[1:26:38] faith is continually moving continually
[1:26:41] moving
[1:26:42] faith is moving towards
[1:26:45] the resurrection faith is
[1:26:48] moving toward the rapture the faith
[1:26:51] that was restored by malachi 4
[1:26:55] 5 to the elect lady is a faith
[1:26:58] that's moving like the magnet it's
[1:27:00] sweeping the people up
[1:27:02] it's taking them to the promises of god
[1:27:05] it's fulfilling everything that he said
[1:27:07] preparing them for rapturing condition
[1:27:11] so we see that that great faith and and
[1:27:14] and we'll kind of close with
[1:27:16] with that tonight and because
[1:27:19] you know then you can go back and he
[1:27:21] says this so when a man lives by faith
[1:27:23] and walks by faith
[1:27:25] i mean the substance of faith now what's
[1:27:28] the substance
[1:27:30] the taking ownership of the promise when
[1:27:33] a man
[1:27:34] lives by the fact that he's taken
[1:27:37] ownership of the promise
[1:27:41] now he's letting the spirit
[1:27:44] move to bring that to pass he's not
[1:27:48] bringing it to pass
[1:27:49] jesus said i can do nothing without the
[1:27:52] father
[1:27:53] showing me you you don't have to produce
[1:27:56] the result
[1:27:58] you planted the seed the spirit
[1:28:01] will move that seed will come to pass
[1:28:06] when you walk with that kind of
[1:28:08] substance
[1:28:09] this is what he's talking about a people
[1:28:13] that take possession of the promise
[1:28:18] they possess the enemy's gate by taking
[1:28:21] the possession of the promise
[1:28:24] and closing any thing that anybody
[1:28:28] would say that's what abraham did
[1:28:31] god promised him a son he took
[1:28:33] possession of the promise
[1:28:35] regardless of the circumstances and what
[1:28:38] was attributed to him for righteousness
[1:28:41] get this because it's the same thing
[1:28:43] that's attributed to you for
[1:28:45] righteousness
[1:28:46] that the god that made the promise was
[1:28:49] able to perform that which he promised
[1:28:54] hallelujah
[1:28:57] that's simple
[1:29:00] why do we get the mirror in the picture
[1:29:04] why do we get the flesh it's all
[1:29:08] promised it's all what he said
[1:29:12] you've just got to have the substance
[1:29:15] that
[1:29:16] it's yours
[1:29:20] i am a part of this bride
[1:29:23] prove it he said so
[1:29:26] well i am to know you're a snake so what
[1:29:28] this is a first snake that's going to be
[1:29:30] raptured
[1:29:32] i don't care what you say
[1:29:36] my my righteousness is his filthy rags
[1:29:39] anyway
[1:29:39] he's the one that performs it if the
[1:29:43] spirit
[1:29:43] gave it to me if i heard it
[1:29:48] and i had ears to hear the substance of
[1:29:51] my faith is not the works i produce
[1:29:55] the substance of my faith is accepting
[1:29:57] the ownership that it
[1:29:58] was that's what he said the substance of
[1:30:01] faith
[1:30:02] is you saying these promises
[1:30:06] are yours
[1:30:09] all he wants you to do abraham tried to
[1:30:14] do it himself
[1:30:15] and we have the middle east
[1:30:25] i i don't think that's what we got
[1:30:32] right abraham tried to botch it every
[1:30:36] way he could
[1:30:40] he lied
[1:30:43] picture that poor king he's an
[1:30:46] upright man
[1:30:50] i like how brother branham says it here
[1:30:52] comes 85 year old sarah into town
[1:30:56] little old granny and here's this king
[1:30:59] and he says oh she's fair and beautiful
[1:31:03] beyond imagination
[1:31:08] because a promise has transformation in
[1:31:12] it
[1:31:13] do you hear me a promise has
[1:31:16] the transformation in it
[1:31:20] you accept the promise you're accepting
[1:31:23] the transformation
[1:31:25] that goes with promise promise has
[1:31:28] transformation in it
[1:31:32] and he lies
[1:31:36] he says who's this beautiful woman my
[1:31:37] sister
[1:31:39] liar liar
[1:31:44] he flat out lied
[1:31:48] and the king preps for wedding and
[1:31:50] everything at least celebrating
[1:31:52] everything
[1:31:53] he goes to sleep and the angel lord
[1:31:55] comes to me says you're dead
[1:31:57] he says why am i dead
[1:32:00] i've always lived upright she's your
[1:32:04] dead man
[1:32:06] you might as well go measure your casket
[1:32:08] you're out of here you're history
[1:32:11] why what did i do you're going to marry
[1:32:13] another man's wife
[1:32:15] he told me it was his sister
[1:32:19] yeah you better go have him pray for you
[1:32:25] why why the power was in the promise
[1:32:30] the transformation was in the promise
[1:32:32] the keeping power
[1:32:34] was in the promise all you have to do is
[1:32:36] take possession of it
[1:32:44] not only that the king went
[1:32:48] he he's went and had him pray for me
[1:32:51] he prayed for him then the king dumped
[1:32:53] all kinds of treasures on it
[1:32:55] you tell me that program i like that
[1:32:59] program don't you
[1:33:00] you accept the promise you think he did
[1:33:03] it
[1:33:03] once he did it again
[1:33:09] but what was imputed to him for
[1:33:11] righteousness
[1:33:13] the substance
[1:33:18] we act what we're lacking
[1:33:23] remember he said they didn't have the
[1:33:26] faith
[1:33:26] to make the promise work because they
[1:33:29] didn't
[1:33:29] accept it as being theirs
[1:33:37] oh church do do we want to move up
[1:33:40] higher
[1:33:41] do we want to get in rapturing faith
[1:33:44] then we've got to recognize ourselves
[1:33:47] because he says
[1:33:48] when you when he says when you have
[1:33:50] faith
[1:33:52] and walk by faith i mean the substance
[1:33:56] of faith
[1:33:57] when you walk by the acceptance
[1:34:01] of the promise letting the spirit of
[1:34:04] faith move to manifestation
[1:34:08] he is isolated from the entire world
[1:34:12] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:34:15] there's
[1:34:16] now you're getting in to bride material
[1:34:20] see you're getting in to rapturing
[1:34:23] condition and then because faith and
[1:34:26] love is a relationship
[1:34:28] we won't stay there but we'll move to
[1:34:30] this last statement
[1:34:34] tonight because we're talking about
[1:34:37] a faith that moves
[1:34:41] now
[1:34:44] how many understand that we are getting
[1:34:47] ready for the rapture
[1:34:50] there's nothing else on the agenda for
[1:34:53] us
[1:34:55] and i preached last sunday the only
[1:34:58] reason
[1:34:59] that god promised to restore the faith
[1:35:03] and the works that i do you shall do
[1:35:06] also
[1:35:07] is because by these works you know that
[1:35:10] that spirit is moving
[1:35:11] and that's what gets you into rapturing
[1:35:14] condition
[1:35:17] because if it doesn't manifest
[1:35:22] then what is it it's letter
[1:35:27] but if you start seeing the resurrection
[1:35:30] life
[1:35:31] manifesting itself in your life
[1:35:35] you see the resurrection power doing
[1:35:38] signs and wonders you see the
[1:35:40] resurrection power
[1:35:42] healing you see the resurrection power
[1:35:44] delivering
[1:35:45] what you're seeing is as you're seeing
[1:35:47] those promises
[1:35:48] fulfilled and you're seeing the spirit
[1:35:52] do it if you can't see the spirit
[1:35:58] moving that's what the world couldn't do
[1:36:02] they couldn't save william branham
[1:36:04] standing there as a man
[1:36:07] and then know that when he called out
[1:36:09] the people
[1:36:10] and the discern their thoughts and
[1:36:12] intents of the heart
[1:36:14] turned his back to the audience raised
[1:36:16] the dead that
[1:36:17] wasn't william branham that was the
[1:36:19] spirit of god
[1:36:20] deity veiled in flesh moving
[1:36:24] fulfilling a promised word
[1:36:28] that same spirit has got to move in you
[1:36:31] in the eye
[1:36:36] so as we gain evidence
[1:36:40] and experience and see these things
[1:36:44] maybe you're battling cigarettes
[1:36:48] why not see the power of the
[1:36:49] resurrection deliver you from them
[1:36:51] cigarettes
[1:36:52] that's just as great as raising the dead
[1:36:59] hallelujah maybe you got
[1:37:02] bitterness in your heart towards
[1:37:04] somebody
[1:37:07] maybe you got just a problem just
[1:37:09] talking
[1:37:11] you know being a listener is just as bad
[1:37:14] as being a talker
[1:37:16] takes two of them to make it gossip
[1:37:21] wouldn't it be the power of the
[1:37:22] resurrection starting to deliver you
[1:37:24] from
[1:37:25] burdens delivering you from depression
[1:37:29] delivering you from selfishness
[1:37:31] delivering
[1:37:32] you from lustful spirits delivering you
[1:37:35] from anger
[1:37:36] delivering you that's the same power of
[1:37:38] the resurrection
[1:37:39] because that's being delivered from
[1:37:41] death that's the same thing as
[1:37:43] resurrection
[1:37:46] it's wonderful and the more you
[1:37:49] experience that the more it becomes real
[1:37:51] to you
[1:37:52] okay and the more you say is that
[1:37:53] important jesus sent him out
[1:37:56] sent him out and told him go pray go do
[1:38:00] this what was he trying to do
[1:38:02] if i could excuse my expression but he
[1:38:05] was almost
[1:38:05] prepping them and instructing them
[1:38:10] to what was going to come he wanted them
[1:38:13] to get
[1:38:13] used to the understanding of the spirit
