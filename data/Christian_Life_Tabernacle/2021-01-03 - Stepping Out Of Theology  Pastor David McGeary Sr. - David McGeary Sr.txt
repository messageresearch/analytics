to be gathered in his presence amen Happy New Year to all amen I trust you come this morning renewed and feeling fresh and ready to run the race again amen amen we going to invite by Mike for our Psalm reading this morning certain you want to welcome all our visitors amen everyone in the house of God Amen good morning Happy New Year I think never was there a more anticipated restart than the see 2021 finally come across the calendar you know if you spend any time at all in business or even just in in regular life Corporate America like maybe some of us are in specific Industries at the start of every year there's always this effort to make predictions about what the current year is going to hold right you know either there's some Specialist or some company or some talking head or some article or whatever the case may be that's throwing out you know here's our forecast for the coming year here's our predictions for this year what to expect in 2021 you know often there's an agenda behind it somebody that wants to sell the one thing that's going to help you capitalize on all of those on all of those predictions but you know it's so interesting that even after a year like we've just had the mankind is still flooding everybody's inboxes with predictions what to expect here's our forecast for 2021 how to prepare for the coming year and you know that's that's kind of how it is it's how how man tends to be is to try to put their finger on what the future is going to be and try to anticipate or make preparation for what that is and you know usually as with the case you get to the end of the year and none of those predictions none of those forecasts came true at all you know the year went right when we expected it to go left or some you know disruption showed up you know what it also shows us is We cannot put our trust in the forecasts or the predictions or the view of man but there is a forecast there is a set of predictions that we can put our trust in you know and I would submit to you that we have a forecast for 2021 like to turn to Psalm 93 this morning you know we don't do predictions but we do do promises and if we want to know what 2021 is going to look like maybe we'll sit and look at three promises for 2021 it says in verse one it says the Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wherewith Heath GED himself the world also is established and it cannot be moved you know what's 20 21 is going to look like here's our forecast our first promise is the Lord is on the throne all right and everything is in his control that's a promise that's our forecast for 2021 you know it's interesting it says from verse in verse two it's from Everlasting so not only is it in his control but he's established everything from Everlasting that's your forecast that's your promise for 2021 you want to look at promise number two Another Part Of Your forecast for 20 21 you look in verse three the floods have lifted up oh Lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves so here's another promise for 2021 the floods are going to continue to come against us you know in the scripture a flood is a great pressure right it can thing about a flood is it can shake foundations right it can threaten to wash you away to overwhelm you you know in our in 2021 our forecast is is the floods are going to continue to be there they're going to continue to come against us don't be surprised by it expect it that's our promise that's our forecast for 2021 but we also know that when the enemy will come in like a flood the Lord will raise up a standard against it which takes us to promise number three for 2021 and it's verse four the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many Waters amen yay then the mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies are very sure Holiness becometh thy house O Lord forever so our forecast for 2021 promise number three is there's going to be a continuing unmovable Fortress against the floods as they raise up it's you know our our this this this this Fortress Is Not Anchored In predictions it's anchored in promises his own promises his testimonies are very sure but here's my favorite part Holiness becometh thine house you know there's a place of Separation there's a place a set aart place which is all Holiness is a set aart place where he dwells and it's an unmovable Fortress and it says that I go to prepare a place for for you that's right that where I am there you may be also present tense so here's your promises here's your forecast for 2021 everything's under his control he's on the throne he's laid it all out from the beginning there's going to continue to be floods that come against us and there's going to continue to be a standard raised against it that's your predictions for 2021 and so if we look at Psalm 20 93 and read that this morning it's just a short Psalm but you know I look at that as being I know about you but those are the predictions I'm going to hang on to for 2021 so let's read that together Psalm 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath GED himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved thy Throne is established of old thou art from Everlasting the flood floods have lifted up oh Lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many Waters yay than the mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies are very sure Holiness becometh thine house oh Lord forever amen

amen that's what we're here to do this morning amen sister an is a special if she could come at this time and then after that brother goel and you can bring your special amen before I sing the song of I wanted just to share a little bit of my testimony behind this um you know it's easy to sing when things are going well it's easy to praise the Lord but it's a little bit harder when things are not going so great um and in the past four years of my life the Lord has taught me to learn how to praise him through the storm he's taught me to praise him through the storm when my parents' marriage was falling apart when my dad tried to overdose with pain medicine when my siblings went into the world and tested all the things that are not great he uh taught me how to praise him through the storm when my grandmother found out she had cancer when I battled my spiritual when I had my own spiritual battle and what I've learned through the midst of it all is when you learn to push yourself and praise the Lord when it's the hardest to do so even if your lips can't say anything like your soul can and um I realized that the moment that I said God you know what I know you're going to get me through it even when I don't see the Finish Line you're going to give me that Victory to overcome and the the beauty in this song that just it just hits that spot is when it says I'll praise you in the storm and I'll lift my hands for you are who you are no matter where I am every tear I've cried you hold in your hand you've never left my side and though my heart is torn I'll praise you in the storm so I want to praise the Lord today and I if you know the song feel free to join me I was sure by now God you would have reached down and WIP my tears away stepped in and save the day but once again I say Amen and it's still raining and As The Thunder Rolls I barely hear your whisper through the rain I'm with you and as your mercy falls I'll raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away and all praise Raise You In This Storm and I will lift my hands cuz you are who you are no matter where I am in every tear I've CED you hold in your hands you never left my side and though my heart is tor I will praise you in the [Music] storm and I remember when I stumbled in the wind you heard my cry to you and rais me up again my strength is almost gone how can I carry on if I can't can find [Music] you and As The Thunder Rolls I barely hear you whisper through the rain I'm with [Music] you and as your mercy falls I raise my hands and praise the God who gives and takes away [Music] and I'll Praise You In This stor and I will lift my hands cuz you are who you are no matter where I am and every tear I've CED you hold in your hands you've never left my side and those oh my heart is [Music] tor I will Praise You In This Storm I lift my eyes up to the hills where does my help come from my help comes from the Lord the maker of heaven and Earth I lift my eyes unto the hills where does my help come from my help comes from the Lord the maker of heaven and Earth and I'll Praise You In This store and I will lift my hands cuz you are who you are no matter where I am and every tear I've cry you hold in your hands you've never left my side and though my heart is [Music] tall I will Praise You In This Storm and I'll Praise You In This Storm and I will lift my hands cuz you are who you you are no matter where I am in every tear I've cried you hold in your hands you've never left my side and though my heart is tall I will Praise You In This Storm amen God bless your SS uh before I sing this song There is uh there's this undenying and sometimes it went by that we don't notice it it's God's love as I see every one of us here with the crazy year that just went through for many of us there's nothing that could keep keep us together than God God's love the other night brother Billy told me Isaac oh won't you redo that song and then I went home and thought about it I was

transforms it into life and food to the soul and feeds each need and each direction that you want to give and Lord your spirit is the leader of the church and we ask that we would come under that great wonderful Holy Spirit this morning Lord grant to each need that is here this morning in a special way that father they know it's you we ask you to bless us and help us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you Happy New Year to you you know I I like the idea that it's a new year so we'll uh trust the Lord that it that it's a great place for you to start with anything that you want to do You' got to have a starting place so let's make sure that it's something that's for the kingdom of God certainly enjoyed the specials this morning and I I certainly see that we've got lots and lots of talent you know like I always say you know brother Orlando always say to him he'll say how you gonna how you going to preach behind that or how you going to do it well I don't know how we're going to do it but we know he'll help us amen if you're hungry I'm sure he'll reach out and feed your heart this morning so let's uh turn in our Bibles this morning and um I hope that I can uh bring this out I'm going to read some statements out of the message um this morning that called it's called what it takes to overcome all unbelief and and then it he says our faith but um we want to bring another thought out from that uh message that is a part of what that um we want to do but so we want to read over here in St the gospel of St Luke the 4th chapter and the 14th down through the 18th verse we'll we'll read through the 21st verse and and um I know this scripture is used in other messages but we're not taking it from uh the the aspect of what most of us think when we read this but and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit in into Galilee and there went out a Fame of him throughout all the region round about so we know the great story in the setting here Jesus just came off the great Temptation off of the mountain and so Satan had offered him to do everything and give him everything everything so that he wouldn't do what he was called to do That's what Satan didn't want him to do what he's come to do okay so he was trying to rob him of his purpose and so it says it and there went out a Fame of him throughout all the regions round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet Isaias and when he had had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives to recover the sight of the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book when he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen may be seated I I believe that great scripture is still being fulfilled this morning and I I I want to bring this uh thought uh to you this morning er um you know I I'm not a great evangelist by any means but just as a pastor that it's necessary many times that we set in our heart uh the direction that we should go in or that we should bring to remembrance to the people to consider certain things to consider certain thoughts in order to examine ourselves to look at ourselves to have make sure that we're placed in the right place and and so what I wanted to minister this morning as a subject or a thought that we could build to is that uh is stepping out of theology stepping out of Theology and so I i' like to try to share with you this morning what that I mean by that because we all have things that we believe we we we have belief and the purpose of theology because we should have sound Doctrine and uh so theology has its purpose and having a sound Doctrine has its purpose because a sound Doctrine when you know the truth and you're Anchored In God's word it keeps you from being lied to and what false Doctrine always does is tries to change the narrative it tries to draw a picture it tries to see draw a a a certain Viewpoint and set in your mind a certain way of thinking that's why it's very difficult for someone who has accepted the doctrines of the Trinity and and believes that there's three Gods ever to really come to a full understanding of their relationship with the father as a son because when he's a presented as a trinity he's not presented as anything that you can personally identify with because you've got God the Father you've got God the son you've got God the Holy Ghost you've got all these things up there and you don't know who to pray to and it leaves you ever in a state that you will never be able to find the fact that you came from the mind of God yourself that the purpose that he sent his son was to redeem you and to and to save you and that your name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life if someone would be received the false doctrine that the speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Ghost then that shuts them down to where if they if they don't haven't spoken tongues or they have to fake that they spoke in tongues and all those things it it just throws you out of balance for what the real evidence of the holy spirit is and you know you have the Holy Spirit I'm not talking about spiritual anointing when you've met Jesus Christ personally the evidence of the holy spirit is the Jesus Christ revealed to you personally you know him you just know him he he's introduced himself to you you didn't find him he found you and you you might have the Theology of it of all the things that God is you might have the Bible teaching on it but when it becomes personal to you and you know that you've met him you've stepped out of the Theology and now you've come to something that's real and that's personal amen and so we and that's what the spirit is and uh I I I believe last Sunday our brother did a nice job on on on trying to express to us the need for the spirit so you could do works and and live a life from theology but could never have the life of the spirit in you and and and that's how that he could say depart from me you doers of iniquity I never knew you in other words I never knew you I've never met you I've never talked with you you've done everything from just Theology and we want to step out of Theology and I'm not talking about stepping away from sound Doctrine I'm I'm talking about something that's more personal to you this morning so if I could say like as we start this year if we could just take a moment and have a personal examination of our life to stand back and and see where we're positioned to to see what what our pathway is uh to uh examine ourselves and I think that we realize that in this ladyo and age that we live in that it it it it takes and the believer is granted to them that overcometh in this blind wretched poor miserable naked age that we live in where man doesn't even feel they need God science has risen to the place and education has risen to the place that they don't need Faith their their trust is in everything else now education isn't bad it's fine to get education it's it's fine to get a degree what's wrong is when you trust in it you know that's not where our trust is anchored in our trust is anchored in the Lord and and where it is so and we we realize that there's there's there's something that God is looking for and and so when we stand back and we look at ourselves we we have to have this great uh uh Revelation if I could say it in our heart so I'd like to just read uh uh a a couple scriptures here found in Luke the 18th chapter and he's just given this story story about the you know the unjust judge and how that the Widow pursued him night and day and and uh wouldn't get off his back and finally he got so tired of her he said here just do it whatever you want you know just leave me alone I like that I like that persistence but he says here in the and the Lord said Luke 8 uh 18 and six and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge said and shall not God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them just think of how longsuffering God has been to us you know and uh and so into the picture this morning we have a God that's been Longs suffering with us and he says and I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and so we realize that God's not looking for theology he's looking for faith he's looking for something that is a substance within you that believes the word of God and we want to stretch that out a little farther not just believing it in the promises but believing in the work now we we we realize that uh there's there's there there's go now as we listen he says now if you want to put this on the screen as you go it's from the message what it takes to overcome all be unbelief a 6 uh z uh uh July the 29th 1960 in Yakama and I don't know what book I got this from but this is a paragraph e13 and he says this he says now now all Redemptive blessings to us the human race was paid for us at Calvary when Jesus died for us now remember what is he looking for he's not looking for the theology that he died for us he's not looking for the teaching that he died for us he wants to step out of the Theology of it or the intellect of it and can get a and believe in what that he accomplished in other words believe what the work was because we just read the scripture and he says I'm anointed I've been anointed Amen in other words I've went out in the wilderness I've been baptized I received the Holy Spirit I've come back filled with the Holy Ghost Jesus asked them can you be baptized with the baptism wherein I was baptized with now we're talking about faith not theology theology is he went and got baptized theology is he did this theology is did that theology's woven with history but the question is do you believe that you can be baptized with the same baptism that he was baptized with and I honestly feel that that was the purpose that our messenger came back to this church that was lost in darkness to let them know that they could have the same baptism that he was baptized with so look let's just listen closely as we read this we believe that the that the work and the complete plan of God in every Redemptive blessing was completed at Calvary that all of God's promises was made possible to every human being that would accept it okay now you understand what I'm talking about when you step out of the theology yeah yeah you get that Spirit something's going to trans happen so we've got to take it out of theology step out of Theology and bring it into reality when Jesus died to clear that human before God at Calvary so he cleared the board now if you believe that you've got to clear the board I believe that every man in the world was saved when Jesus died at Calvary every sick person in the world was healed when Jesus died at Calvary but now it's a finished work now the thing to do is can we get the people to see it and accept it when you step out of the Theology and you see it then you accept it it's not something that you believe come on it becomes a reality and a possession yes sir I'm you know when you say I'm redeemed well you can't say I'm redeemed and carry on all kinds of guilt of all your sins if you've confessed your sins he's rightful he's just and faithful to forgive him now if you believe that you have to step out of the theology that he died at Calvary and step into the reality of acceptance amen Lord help us as we go further therefore Divine Healing doesn't lay upon some magic something that someone has in their hands or some holy oil or water that they sprinkle on the people I do not believe in those things I believe that the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient for everything we have need of see I believe it's something has already been paid for so we we understand that there's a finished work and and a as we realize that great finished work and we realize that that God's looking for Faith but he's also said these things if we would look in St John the 14th CH uh chapter of St John in the 12th verse let's read in St John 10 uh 36 first let's try let's just let's start with the 33rd verse of St John 10 and Jesus answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy because that thou being a man makest thyself God and Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I say ye are gods now what's he looking for when he comes he's not looking for theology he's looking for Faith he's not looking for an intellectual explanation of that statement he's looking for people that have the faith to possess it like he said I forgive you and you say oh Lord I'm so sorry he says I forgive you oh I'm so sorry I can't believe in it you I've done those things I forgive you it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness well you can believe that he's forgiven you of your sins in theology come on preacher but if you accept your pardon then you walk out of the prison and condemnation is a prison of Satan that's why he came he said I come to re to bind up the Brokenhearted to set the captives those that have been bruised yeah and there's the sins bruised your lives yes sir and none of us have a past that we really want to explain you know nobody ever gives you details and don't give the details of your testimony yes sir you were a sinner we get the picture amen you know if you just want to describe the sin and describe how drunk you were or how loose you morally and all the then you're still reveling in those things but that's what he takes away from us he takes away the shame of it he takes away the condemnation of it so we can say I was amen but I died to that Hallelujah and that man is buried and I'm resurrected in the Lord Jesus um he says ye are Gods if he called them Gods unto whom the word of the Lord came and the scriptures cannot be broken EXA say ye of him whom the father hath Sanctified and sent unto the world th blasphemeth because I say I am the Son of God all that believed on him he gave them the power to become the Sons and Daughters of God I mean when when do we step out of the theology into the reality that we are Sons and Daughters of God we're not in this world we're not of this world and we shouldn't be partaking of the world in the styles of the world or or anything in the world you know I I Marvel sometimes at the singing in the world today Christian songs that if you research it a little bit you're going to take it back to the style of some worldly [Music] singer the same beat the same uh feel uh you know just those things it's not important brother go ahead well thank you anyway uh and and and it's driven I went to a bookstore over here uh where they used to have a big church you a big bookstore and I went in the bookstore and then there was a shelf he said if you like Dolly Parton you will like this musician this musician and this musician if you like Jimmy lafaya or whatever the guy's name was you'll like this and L I looked up and down couldn't find anything about you know if you're a Christian or if you're born again or if you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's always relating back to Talent relating back to style and those things and and I I'll tell you I like heartfelt music the the song the sister sonng the first time I heard that song it bound with my heart and I know what that song's about you know I I never want to be caught up into the style or the music or the beat but I want to be able to connect with the words okay and that's why when you you step out of theology you step into the reality in other words I'm singing about what I know I'm singing about somebody who I've met I'm not bringing you the beat I'm not bringing you the tone I'm not bringing you the Rhythm I'm bringing you the god that's supposed to be in the song and there's a bunch of Christian music today there ain't no God in it the theology is there but there's not the life experience behind it there there's not the suffering behind it they like it cuz they like the song they like the beat they like the words they like the artist that did it but but they've never been into that place in in that hidden chamber where that song was birthed so you start to understand what I'm talking about about stepping out of the Theology of it amen of the Christianity can I take my coat off I don't know I'm burning up amen and I'm trying to stay calm trying to be the new me so uh so we were reading uh and he said that I that I'm the Son of God if I do not the works of my father believe me not act and this is what we're going to just Fellowship a little bit about Jesus was anointed to do a work his his anointing is upon me to do this to do that to carry out these things so what I'm saying is you can stay in the Theology and never get in the work we've got to step out of the theology into the work amen okay that could this this is very important to me as a pastor that if I don't do anything else at least I tell you and show it to you in the word of God all let's just finish the scripture we'll go forward if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do thou though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their mid it it when he when he finally comes down and and he says if I do not the works of my father Believe Me Not So when it it came down it didn't matter what the theology was right because theology without works is dead and that's what Paul said show me your theology without your works and I'll show you my theology by my works so if we step out of the theology out of the teaching and realize that the reason that the spirit was given to us was to do the work that's right and let me say we preach it that the spirit was given to us to believe the the ology am we do I mean I Heard lots of preaching if you've got the Holy Ghost you'll believe this believe that you'll believe you'll believe Malachi 4:5 you'll believe the opening of the seals you be but that's not what the spirit was given for the spirit was given to do the work isn't that what he comissioned us to do was to go into all the world and preach the gospel and the these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay hands on the sick they shall do this work they should do that work they could do this work and then he said to them he said but go Terry first until you're endued with power from on high because you can't do his work until you have his Spirit to do his work just just just think of that he we we know what his work is cuz he purchased it for us and that's what he he said he he said this let's just take that for a moment paragraph uh 20 of the same message now the scripture said Jesus said himself in John 14:7 he that heareth my words no The Works that I do that he believeth on me the works that I do shall shall he do also so he that believeth on me the works that I do he'll do also so he's come back to look for faith not theology right he's looking for the faith because he that believes does the work so that that's why you know them by their fruits not by their theology so the very fact he says that he that believeth on me why don't we just read that there for a moment in St John 14 did I get that uh right there I thought verse 12 so after he had finished washing their feet and taking His Garment he said you know what I you what I have done to you oh I'm in 13 okay thank you I knew something was wrong I you you're going to have to bear with me I'm getting older anybody identify with that not in here right okay okay John 14 and yes okay so he says if you had known me you would have known my father also and from hence forth ye know him and have seen him Philip S the Lord show us the father and it survice us Jesus said un to him have I been with you so long a time with you and yet hast thou not known me he hath seen me hath seen the father and the father and and and how sayth thou show us the father believest thou that I am in the father and the father in me and the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but of the father that dwelleth in me he doth The Works Jesus did not teach theology he taught works yeah I'm not talking about Church of Christ works or or calvinist Works he talk taught about being about the father's business believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake he never wanted us to try to Anchor people in our Doctrine and our Theology and not have a real genuine life that was manifesting what you believe like you don't believe the Lord's coming soon and have nothing in your life that shows you're looking for him verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the word works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and what soever you shall ask in my name that I will do and the father may be glorified in the son and if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me you will keep my command Commandments and so that that's the scripture and he says now greater back to our quote the English translation says greater than this shall he do for I go to my father but if you take the original translation that it says more shall he do now more shall you do now let's begin to listen as we just go through the Sunday School lesson now no one could do great than he did because he raised the dead he stopped nature and just done everything but what it said was that he said a little while and the world shall see me no more more now that the word is Cosmos which means the world order so the word World won't see him it shall see me no more yet ye his church shall see me for I is a personal pronoun and we know that I will be with you he's even said and in you until the end of the world now what is it then God could manifest himself through one man a man his son called Jesus now God takes the spirit of Jesus and puts it back upon his children that's been adopted by Jesus Christ and manifest The Same Spirit the same power the world around that God in us Emmanuel in us we've been cleansed by the blood of Jesus and I do believe in pure absolute Holy Ghost religion and Holiness I believe that a man cleaned up from a life of sin quits all of his drinking lying stealing and everything else I believe he lives for God because the spirit in him is God's spirit and that Spirit leads him and guides him into righteousness and Holiness that God could live in him and will do his will in him so he God can only do his Works in one man so he sent the spirit back that the works that I do shall you do also so you can't do his work without his spirit amen I mean that's just that's just what it takes so he can't and and this is what in our day we we know that the prophet of God was sent and God sent a message to his church to restore back the Faith of Our Fathers not the Theology of our fathers not just to get the godhead teaching right the evidence of the Holy Spirit right Holiness dressing right we we begin to anchor on that and then we begin to Anchor in the Theology of the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 and when you do that you end up becoming a denomination like any other denomination yes sir you become a single organization within yourself because now you've anchored in the theology now it's what your Doctrine is it's what you believe what your uh dress code is what your church code is you you you've rested and you've anchored in the teachings and now you enter into the Battle of comparing my doctrines and teachings are more sound than your doctrines and teachings but Paul said I never came unto you with enticing words but I came unto you with the power and the demonstration of the spirit he was saying if you can't believe me for what I'm teaching believe me for my works amen step out of the theology for a moment and see God moving in [Applause] reality and he said a little while the world will see me no more but use Cosmos world's Cosmos I'll be with you he said even in you until the end of the world now what was it then God could not manifest him he could manifest him through self through one man a man his son called Jesus now God takes the spirit of that Jesus and puts it back on his children amen so he he the the spirit is given for a purpose in other words he can't restore the faith without restoring the works that's right because the faith was given for the works that's why he gave it that's why he sent his Spirit we're treating the spirit like it's foreign aid you know what I mean like it's our it's our own uh it's it's our own personal care package I've got the spirit for when I need something I've got the spirit when I need to go grab a pro promise I want Faith so I can get this and I can get this and I can solve this and I can have this and and we leave out yeah that that's our theology that we can believe every promise of God every promise is the book is there every chapter every verse every line that's our theology but when do we step out of that Theology and the have the spirit of God that we've been baptized with not just there working on our behalf but we go out and now enter into the labor of being about the father's business now let's really look at ourselves we've sat in the presence of this message under the anointing of the Prophet messenger because my sheep know my voice and when I need to pray the Refuge I lay down and put on a tape but every now and then you put on one of those tapes and it starts talking to you you're stepping out of the theology that this is a prophet you're stepping out of the theology I believe him I like his voice and it starts crying back at you what have you done when I think of brother man preaching that message standing in the Gap he says what have I done I've done nothing I got to get about my father's business and I thought oh man brother brandom I'm pretty happy here riding on your coat tail I've judged myself in only because I've judged everybody else out and that's not what he's looking for he's not looking for theology he's looking for a faith that believes the word enough that it does the works yes sir a lot of us don't have anything at all we're doing for the kingdom of God and let's just read read he said but take the original trans says more shall he do now no one could do greater than he did we read that I believe and then he says what he says it's Emmanuel in us and now we have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus and I do believe in pure absolute Holy Ghost religion drinking lying stealing everything else I believe in that and that the spirit leads him and guides him into all righteousness and Holiness that God could live in him and will do his will in him so he sends a spirit to do his will or if I could say this to continue the work work of Jesus Christ because that was the the commission he said go into all the world do these things things that I do the works that I do you should do also but go carry into the upper room and wait till you get the spirit and you're endued with power from on high to do the work we it's like we're all still I I use these terms but I don't mean it personal but it's like staying in the upper room with the pillar of fire and the anointing that's the theology yeah but when you step out to Theology and you step into the work yeah amen let's just drop down he says and when the son of 22nd he says and when the Son of God God once lived in the pillar of fire led the children of Israel then he come down and lived in a man his own son a created body then he got a little closer to us so when he came down to live he was a little closer to us then he had to sanctify that body to break that virgin born blood cell to cleanse the church that he might live in everybody's heart that would accept that blood for a cleansing Paul says so that he could come into their hearts by the Holy Spirit then that God God working in us we we receive the spirit like and we teach it so much this way that I've got the spirit I'm sealed under the day of my Redemption that's all I need to do do you have the spirit are you baptized in the spirit and are answerers we stopped there because that's our theology yeah but the he didn't send the spirit we just to seal a in we were sealed before the foundation of the world with our name wrote on the book of life he sent his spirit so you could continue the work so we understand that we've we we've got to have we we've got to have the great that great move of that spirit in our hearts and lives that he he when he came to restore the faith he didn't come to restore the theology he came to restore the works yeah he says he said sin is unbelief I said sin is unbelief you do those things because you believe not and that believer Believers on the Lord won't do those things he's passed from death and to life but you understand what Sin is Sin is unbelief so do you believe that you're sent into the world do you believe these signs shall follow amen do you believe the works that I do you shall do also that was the promise to the church but that's what nicadan ISM did nickol adism come and took that away from the people and put it on a select group of men they're anointed to do the work they lay hands on their sit they're they're the uh they're The Chosen right no the spirit was given to do the works that's what he said I'll be with you even in you till the end the works that I do you shall do also why because I go unto the father and I send you back the comforter and and we follow the will of the father so the first thing that he he comes he robs that from the people and now they a they're happy with the theology well our pastor prays for the sick our church prays for the sick we had an altar call and that all that is is staying in your theology but when you step out of the Theology and you realize that the work to lay hands and pray for the sick is your possession it's not the theology or the the mental understanding it's the reality of the possession that I've been called I've been anointed I've been chosen to do these works and the spirit that I have has been given to me you have not because you ask not and you ask not because you believe not do you believe this morning you have the Holy Spirit then if you have that spirit that Spirit was given to restore the faith but again faith without can't restore the faith without restoring the works because the faith was given to do the works so you don't really believe if you don't believe that you by the spirit not by your will not by your the theology but by the spirit that you received from the father that anointed you to do the same Works to be a continuation and that's what Jesus says I'm anointed I'm not anointed to be anointed I'm anointed to do the work amen so you understand unbelief can go beyond not just smoking drinking and those things we can do those things by theology amen but do we believe that we receed this spirit for a purpose not just to get in the upper room and be blessed but that he has something that he wants to accomplish in US and that we so whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is our victory that overcometh the world even our faith now there's a there's a purpose that beats down in my heart because so many people they believe but they they they don't overcome the same things bother them day in and day out their Life's a struggle with the same things they be like being delivered from smoking which I believe God does and then every time you smelt the cigarette you know you staggered and until you composed yourself again now you may be able to do that by your theology but there's an overcoming power that you can rise above that right I I guess that I I've got to preach the gospel forgive me but I I I guess the probably the hardest thing for young men and young or men in this day is the lust of the Flesh and you can labor and fight that and it drains and pull you but there is a way to overcome and I believe that's what uh we're talking about what it takes to overcome all [Music] unbelief and when we can begin to understand that part of our ability to overcome is by doing the works of the father if not all you're battling with is your theology you're trying to battle a spirit with what you believe my theology says I shouldn't be like this my theology teaches this my theology teaches that but yet we still labor and struggle Under The Temptations and I know he'll be tempted but there's a lot of difference having that Wellspring of Life bubbling up same nay instead of being on your bed going oh God I just want to overcome so bad I want to be so different and we believe in defeat and I'm trying to say this morning that the there's a way to rise up not saying you don't have the spirit but I I think it's a lack of understanding what the spirit was given to us for like I said it's not a care package it's something that's given to you to be about your father's business let's just read if we could just go to paragraph 52 I'm sorry I'm long this morning but we'll let I'll get through this right after that or before that previously to that he gave the great 11th chapter of HEB Hebrews which gave us the Heroes of Faith by faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith Enoch by faith Noah all the great Heroes of Faith then saying seeing that we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin the unbelief that do so easily beset us let us set aside those things that are keeping us from doing the works yes sir here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and yet we find the church is an nemic condition we ought to be great strong Mighty Warriors of faith that would shake the nation God give it to us we we we would just receive it so there's little things upon us that holds us back from running can you understand so there's something that's holding us back from being about the father's business doing the works that we were commissioned to do amen now I'm not on a search today to try to ring the bell but that's what I'm talking about this morning is the first thing the spirit does is convicts us of what unbelief what is it that's holding you back from doing the work now remember when the scripture when Jesus came and the goat and separated the goats and sheep remember that the scripture he said when I was hungry you fed me when I didn't have clothing you clothed me when I was thirsty you gave me drink everything that the father judged them by not one of them was what their theology was it was they were judged by their life's work and and if we not careful we've anchored in our theology that what we believe is right and we fail to understand that it's not our theology our theology Keeps Us straight keeps us from being deceived keeps us to having a false understanding of God and who he is and what his purpose is but the spirit is upon us that we do the works that we feed the poor and we we we brought that to a spiritual type last Sunday yeah how about giving somebody a drink of the grace of the water of living Fountain how about the meat of the word of God how about visiting those that are in prison those that are captivated by drugs and addictions and things like that amen that holds us back from running let us lay aside all those little weights now because we're looking to the author and finisher of our faith Jesus Christ who was made man on Earth and DS Among Us and was made sin that through his righteousness we might be forgiven of our sins he became us sinners that we might become his righteousness in other words like this he became me that I might become him well what was he come on pre if you don't believe me for what I'm teaching you believe me for my Works believe me for the life you understand what I'm trying to say we got to step out of the theology grab the reality of the spirit and make it work let it work in us let it grow in US when you're a baby you just drink I become me that I might become him he was the son of God I was a sinner he take my place become a sinner that I might be a Son of God about my father's business that's what he says here paragraph 54 we find that when this little tree it pushes out and when it grows it pushes out and when you are born into the kingdom of God just a little baby in Jesus everything that you have need of in this life's journey is in you when you receive the Holy Spirit The Works are in you that's right because the works are in the spirit what's the thing that's keeping that Spirit from doing those works that's our challenge yes sir that's what we've got to find out are we too entangled into the world what is the weight that's keeping us us from running that's the challenge that you have to meet as individuals if not we think I'm going because I'm in the message but the message was the restoration of the faith and the faith was the restoration of the works everything that you have need of in your life journey is in you when you receive the Holy Ghost oh then what do we have oh then what do you have to do is drink and drink and keep drinking don't stop when you join church and are baptized just keep drinking till you have faith for this and Faith for that and Faith for this and push out until all the manifestations of the holy spirit is living in the church could it be we're not drinking enough could it be we're not going to the message could it be a lot of you are here you're in your school books you're you're in your music you're in your fellowship you're in the theology but you've got to take a drink of the person of Jesus Christ so if he's in you he'll re you become him and a rewarder of them that diligent seek now we are planted we are planted in Jesus Christ now I believe just in my estimation of him that he's an inexhaustible Fountain of Life am that you cannot ex exhaust his goodness some people think oh I hate to call on God so much that's what he wants you to do you have not because ye ask not and you ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your joy might be filled now we're talking about a church that's working they're asking they're pleading they're praying for the sick they're praying for the captive they're not comfortable in that what they believe is going to get them there what they're resting is is that you can't believe me for what I Bel believe believe me for the works that I do because they are which testify of me he says that's what God wants ask big things I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting I'm asking that every sick person enters that door will go out of here well I'm believing it I'm believing that till we go that this won't be another gathering together but it'll be a Revival he says in Yakama how about here how about us having a Revival Satan kept me out of here long enough I believe the hour is here for a real sweeping Revival in every church and around the country and we just keep reading here from a little bit and you can read with me I'm not a very good reader went out this afternoon went to a different place visiting amongst the people an old straw hat on pulled down over my face and so forth I just to see the attitude of the people you've got fine people here you've got something to work on that's right now what we've got to do is get to work we're here tonight to elect our Lord as our king of our hearts our governor our faith Giver Our God our healer Our Savior elect him in your heart and go out here now and and Care carry it to this great election that's coming at the Judgment when he will be crowned king of kings and Lord of lords get out and carry it to the people now we're living in a terrific day but all that you have need of is already supplied to you when you believe now really don't you start seen the challenge of unbelief it's not the unbelief in the theology it's the unbelief in your calling to do the works right that's the faith he's looking for the faith of his children to do the works and I'm not talking about on yourself oh I better get healed or I better get well you'll get well when God wants you to get well and it'll be for his glory you will get well cuz his word does not fail and if you're given a measure of suffering for a season you accept it with joy looking for your deliverance so many people I find already supplied to you when you believe so many people today I find when they join church and here especially in America they become Drifters they'll just well praise the Lord I've met brother brandom and I got saved and I put my name on the book and that's all I done is it some of they say they meant brother brandom you've all meant him that's all I've done just drifting we don't want to do that you never got saved just to be a member of a church you got saved to work to do the works that he did the works that I do shall you do you didn't get saved to go to church to learn a theology you got saved to work we don't dress an army up just to lay around on the corner and flirt with the girls with a pretty uniform on we train an army to fight and we're not a on a picnic we're on a Battleground that's right we're right here facing the enemy of our Lord and the enemy of our souls let us be up and do doing a heart for and doing with a heart for any Strife let's be doing I like the Psalm of Life be not like a dumb driven cattle have to be driven you into a little Corral somewhere and over this way and down this way let's be heroes life of Great Men all remind us that we make our lives Sublime with parting leaving behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another while sailing over life solemn man from a foreign Lorn and Shipwrecked brother in seeing our Footprints shall take heart again let us do something we're written Epistles I'll just keep reading and then I'll close here's some time ago a few years ago my wife and I was in the study and she was come to the door and said bill there's a bum at the door he wants something to eat eat I said feed him give him something he's a man I don't care what he is feed him divide what we got with him man's hungry she said I'm afraid of him I said oh my I said oh my open the door and tell him to get something to eat fix him something and give it to him so she fixed the table and called him in then she come in the room and said she was afraid of him because he was kind of dirty looking and and I went out and I said how do you do my good man he said how do you do and I said he he was eating his dinner so I said where are you from he said oh just here and there I said where are you going he said oh the same thing just here and there I said what purpose do you have in life he said none what purpose do you have in life it's a good time to start asking ourselves the question what have I been created for what did he give me the spirit it for yeah I found this very challenging from well that's just about the way that people gets in we've got to have something that we got a purpose for we've got to purpose in our hearts we've got to do something we've got the purpose in our heart that we've got to do something this is the messenger telling us how we overcome we overcome all this stuff that's garbage that we're fighting by having something in our heart and a purpose in our heart to do something I hope you can see it I I don't know I I raised up on this the idle mind is the Devil's Playground yeah I'll tell you wasting your time on those video games is destroying your minds you talk about Idol you talk about a man's work here's a man a god Spirit-filled Holy Ghost believer as soon as I defeat Captain buzzb brain any souls to be lost well as soon as I get this guy saved my Trooper my Trooper about to be captivated by devils and I've got to get in there and do the work hour after hour after hour you will be judged for wasting your time sorry I don't care if you're your Pac-Man King Pac-Man's not going to be there what did you come up before the throne what did you do I beat Pac-Man oh enter into the glory of the Lord go sit to Moses who suffered and spent 40 years on the backside of the desert go go talk to Noah who built an ark in the F go down and sit and talk about your work let me tell you you are going to be judged for your work and if you're a do nothing you will be judged as a do nothing regardless of your theology cuz he's not looking for the ology he says nevertheless will I find Faith sorry I got off on all right we've got to do something now you say oh we're having Revival yeah we're over here in the isand our AUD Auditorium don't let don't let that be you just a floater and a Drifter you can never amount to anything like that let us get up and do something about it let us put our shoulder to the wheel let's see that our church prospers let's get let's get the kingdom prospering let's get the kingdom prospering let's get what we believe in working and moving and sharing and life of it living let's revive the kingdom of God and make it a reality let us see that the sick get in here let us see that God is laid down among the people and great signs and wonders take place that will strike the nation I'm satisfied that there will be things happen here that will thrill this country that'll Shake It for the kingdom of God if each one of us will just get behind it what are we doing building a platform for our Lord we want to bring him to Bedford we want to bring him in this great Revival we've got to elect him in our own Hearts we've got to purpose something get something to do with it something to do for some purpose you don't just join the church and drift on you don't do it that way you always you've got to have a purpose in what you're doing the wife says well I'm just a wife get on the telephone do something do something to help the Lord Jesus [Music] now do oh that's so beautiful what's his purpose his purpose is to save his purpose he wants to continue to do his work so he was one man so he poured his spirit and now he's got little Messiahs little gods and what's he saying Help help me do what I was anointed to do I was anointed to heal the brokenhearted to heal the sick to deliver the bruis that's what the anointing was given I'm going to app that anointing on you that you can be me and that the works that I do you do also yes sir help me that's all Jesus is asking help me I've got lost children out there help me can you imagine the master if you can see through the veils of Flesh and the master saying help me I've came to restore the faith I sent the son of man Ministry and we've you've all accepted the theology but we haven't accepted the work help me they were invited to a work and one had an ox in a ditch one had this one had that let's shake the excuses now there is a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose is something that's changed him and that is when a man meets God a man can never be the same if he ever meets God face to face it'll change him in spirit of anything you can do about it a man can never be the same after he once meets God Amen I think that in so many places it's the fault and I won't say other Ministries many many times our very Ministry is that we always preach the people get the spirit because if you have the spirit it's over you're sealed in and then you really come to the realization one day that's never why he gave the spirit that's right we were already sealed in our names always are on the books of life if we had eternal life we always had it he never gave us his Spirit he gave us his Spirit to do the work herein is the love of God that in this world as he is in this world so are we and so I I I just admonish you that a Revival isn't getting people to church it's Reviving what you already have it's getting us back to work us back about the father's business it gets us back about a purpose and and I I just my heart's ate up with it I I I I sit back and I look and I thought I told the brothers I said I'm Irish but this year I'm becoming Dutch they said' what do you mean I said I'm not buying everybody's dinner I'm going handing out everything I I I'll guarantee I bought 30,000 plus dollars worth of lunches and dinners and I thought what a waste of God's money buying stuff that's not even healthy you know you say well why is that that bother you brother McGary that's such a wonderful thing no that's drifting that's no purpose I could have put a sound system in this church there so much I could have done I I sit back and I realize there's so much I could be doing so some sort of more Outreach I know all this pandemic has tried to kill us but you know what we work through it cuz we're going to be workers we're going to have purpose we're going to get involved in the battle sir we've got to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and recognize that this Spirit was given to us to move let's get rid of the weight that so easily besets us I I was wondering Julia could could I ask you to come and sing that song that you sang at our watch Night Service this morning as and brother Billy could come I I just hope that you could see that part of our ability to overcome is to be about the father's work you'll find out a lot of the spirits will lead leave you when you're about the father's business the prophet of God said you got to have a purpose for being healed if if your sickness is keeping you from the father's business then you have a right to claim and push that Spirit out of your life I I the reason I love this song so much is Just it says and I'm going to tell I've come to tell you and I I that's got to be his church we got to rise up out of being a theological church amen we've got to rise up to a church and a people and individuals that are about their father's business so if if she would come and sing that for me tonight are you here sis is she coming okay and in as she sings this can you just take a moment to look at your life and say am I about the father's business my father's business and we trust this morning that this message will really you can see that there's another part of our life so let's step out of our Theology and let's step
