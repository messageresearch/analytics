[9:18] [Applause]
[9:18] [Music]
[9:21] hand. Praise the Lord. Nothing like
[9:24] holding on to his hand. Amen. Amen. I'd
[9:28] sing that song. What a day out that
[9:30] would be. But if I sing that song, I got
[9:33] to tell my story. So, I'm going to tell
[9:35] my story because I feel like singing
[9:37] that song. I'm starting to enjoy this
[9:41] song lead, you know, maybe I'll just
[9:43] become a song leader. Would that be all
[9:45] right? Oh, I got one vote. So, man, I
[9:49] won't have to preach no more. I just
[9:52] come out here and worship the Lord and
[9:55] sing songs. Oh, that's the way it's
[9:57] going to be over there. Huh? We won't
[9:59] need no preaching on the other
[10:02] side. Wouldn't that be good? No
[10:04] preaching. No preaching against living
[10:07] in the world. No preaching against
[10:10] nothing.
[10:13] Amen.
[10:15] Amen. Amen. So, is this the one I want
[10:18] to sing? When he takes me by the hand
[10:20] and leads me through the promised land.
[10:22] So, I got to tell my
[10:24] story. I worked in the lumber
[10:28] mill. And in the lumberm mill, they
[10:30] bring the log up. you know, it's a big
[10:32] log and then they cut it and the sides
[10:36] off and make a big square log out of it.
[10:40] Then they bring it through another saw
[10:42] and they cut it in sizes, 2x sixes,
[10:46] 2x4s, 2x8s,
[10:49] 2x10s. And what they do is they put them
[10:51] all up in this machine and then it goes
[10:54] and there's guys on
[10:56] saws and they grade it and then they
[11:00] say, "Oh, maybe
[11:02] uh it's select and and they'll put 16
[11:07] ft." So when they come out of the
[11:09] machine, they're 16 foot long, they're
[11:12] 10t long, they're 12t
[11:15] long. And and so they come down the this
[11:18] big conveyor belt and you stand there
[11:21] and you pull them off the belt and you
[11:24] put them on a pile and you maybe you've
[11:26] been to Home Depot and you see all these
[11:28] piles of lumber and so you stack them in
[11:31] and then they wrap them and they sell
[11:34] them. So I got there and I was working.
[11:37] I got to singing this song in my heart.
[11:40] What a day that will be when my Jesus I
[11:44] shall see. So, I was just walking and I
[11:47] was putting my boards on the line and my
[11:50] stack and then I walked up and before I
[11:52] knew it, I had the next guy's tuning
[11:54] board. I was stacking his boards and my
[11:57] boards and then I went down and stacked
[12:00] the other guys and there's about five
[12:02] guys all standing around and I was
[12:04] stacking every board on that chain. What
[12:08] a day that'll be. tears running down my
[12:11] eyes, one hand up, stacking boards, and
[12:15] pretty soon there was no
[12:17] boards. And I looked up and all the guys
[12:20] that were sawing the boards were all
[12:23] looking at me and everybody that
[12:26] was stacked in lumber and the whole
[12:28] place was shut down and I was just
[12:32] lost. I wish the boards would have never
[12:35] stopped coming. I would have just stayed
[12:37] there forever. But I just got to
[12:39] thinking, what a day that will be when
[12:42] my Jesus we shall sing. Why don't we
[12:45] sing this as we stand together? We'll
[12:47] invite brother Billy out. We'll just
[12:50] sing this song and just think about what
[12:53] a day that will be when my Jesus I shall
[12:57] sing. Another
[12:59] [Music]
[13:03] day when no
[13:07] heart shall
[13:12] come in the
[13:15] [Music]
[13:21] [Music]
[13:23] sky forever.
[13:25] [Music]
[13:31] Happy. That's what we did.
[13:35] [Music]
[13:51] My
[13:53] Jesus I shall
[13:56] see
[13:58] my upon his
[14:01] [Music]
[14:04] face me.
[14:07] Oh yes, Lord. He takes me
[14:13] by and leads me
[14:15] through the Heat. Heat.
[14:19] [Music]
[14:37] All the
[14:42] [Music]
[14:42] [Applause]
[14:45] [Music]
[14:54] way forever.
[14:59] Yeah.
[15:02] [Music]
[15:09] Heat.
[15:13] Let's just worship. Think about
[15:17] [Music]
[15:28] it. Heat.
[15:34] [Music]
[15:41] Heat. Heat.
[15:43] [Music]
[15:51] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[15:55] [Music]
[16:01] Heat.
[16:04] Heat.
[16:10] [Music]
[16:14] Heat. Heat.
[16:15] [Music]
[16:25] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[16:39] Oh, what a day. Oh, glorious
[16:47] day. Hallelujah. Let's just bow heads.
[16:50] Gracious
[16:52] father. Father, this song just remind us
[16:55] that one of these days this life will
[16:58] come to an end, Lord. Amen. Father, all
[17:00] of our suffering and our trials and
[17:03] everything and and human efforts and all
[17:06] of this will come to an end one day.
[17:09] Father, on that day, you'll make
[17:11] yourself manifested, oh God. And Father,
[17:14] all the efforts and everything that was
[17:16] put in and Father, we'll all be worth
[17:19] it, Lord. And the scripture says that
[17:21] the suffering of this life are not
[17:23] worthy to be compared with the glory
[17:25] that await us, Lord. Father, there's
[17:27] something in the hearts of a believer
[17:29] that that lives for that glory, Lord.
[17:31] And and we know that this life here is
[17:34] only temporal, Lord. And but Father, if
[17:36] we can only live for that life, Lord,
[17:38] that will be worth it all, Lord. And we
[17:40] commit ourselves into your hands
[17:42] tonight, Father. We pray that may you
[17:44] just come by our way, Lord, and speak to
[17:46] us the words of eternal life. Father,
[17:49] because we realize that men shall not
[17:50] live by bread alone, but by every word
[17:53] that proceedth out of the mouth of God,
[17:56] Father, we heard it this morning. We're
[17:57] here once again, Lord. And may you just
[18:00] fill our cups, we ask, Lord, and that we
[18:02] may drink from that eternal fountain
[18:05] that is you, the Lord Jesus Christ, that
[18:07] we may be find renewed and strengthened
[18:10] in the inner man. We commit to service
[18:13] to you and and ask those things. I pray,
[18:15] Father, for those that's still on the
[18:16] way. Father, protect them and bring them
[18:18] safe as we await for them. In the name
[18:21] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and
[18:22] ask those things. Amen. Amen. Certainly
[18:26] good to be gathered once again in the
[18:28] house of
[18:29] God. Man, I know uh there's are few in
[18:33] numbers. There's many that are coming
[18:34] and uh you know, they're not going to be
[18:37] here until 8:30 or 9. So technically we
[18:40] can preach until 8 or 9 is but we're not
[18:43] going to do that.
[18:46] Amen. Did you enjoy the word this
[18:47] morning? Amen. I just want to uh uh
[18:50] continue on that thought. Let's open our
[18:52] Bibles in uh Romans 8. Uh the that same
[18:55] scripture we read this morning.
[19:09] Man, let's let's let's start from the
[19:12] first
[19:13] verse, man. Paul will say it says, "Is
[19:16] therefore now no condemnation to them
[19:19] which are in Christ Jesus, who walketh
[19:22] not after the flesh, but after the
[19:24] spirit. For the law of the spirit of
[19:28] life in Christ Jesus has made us free
[19:30] from the law of sin and death. For what
[19:34] the law could not do in that it was weak
[19:37] through the flesh, God sent his only son
[19:40] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[19:43] sin condemn and for sin condemned sinned
[19:46] in the flesh that the righteousness of
[19:49] the law might be fulfilled in us who
[19:51] walketh not after the flesh but after
[19:54] the spirit. For they that are after the
[19:57] flesh do mind the things of the flesh,
[20:00] but they that are after the spirit the
[20:03] things of the
[20:04] spirit. For to be carnally minded is
[20:07] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[20:10] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[20:13] is immity against God, for it is not
[20:16] subject to the law of God, neither
[20:18] indeed can be. So then they that are in
[20:23] the flesh cannot please God. But ye are
[20:27] not in the flesh. I love
[20:30] that. But in the spirit, if so be that
[20:33] the spirit, the spirit of God dwelt in
[20:37] you. Now if any man had not the spirit
[20:41] of Christ is none of his. And if the
[20:44] spirit if if Christ be in you, the body
[20:48] is dead because of sin. But the spirit
[20:50] is life because of righteousness. But if
[20:53] the spirit of him that raised up Christ
[20:56] Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you, he
[20:59] that raised up Christ from the dead
[21:02] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[21:05] his spirit that dwelleth in you. Let's
[21:08] also turn to uh Ephesians chapter 2.
[21:16] Uh we'll read let's start from verse
[21:18] one.
[21:22] It says, "And you had he quickened, who
[21:26] were dead in sin and trespass, in
[21:29] trespass and sins, and were in time
[21:32] past, where in time past ye walk
[21:34] according to the course of this world,
[21:36] according to the princes, the prince of
[21:38] the power of the air, the spirit that
[21:41] now workketh in the children of
[21:43] disobedient, among whom also ye all had
[21:47] our we all had our conversation in time
[21:50] past in the lust of the flesh,
[21:52] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[21:55] of the mind, and were by nature the
[21:58] children of wrath, even as others. But
[22:01] God, who is rich in mercy, for his great
[22:04] love, wherewith he loved us, even when
[22:08] we were dead in sin, had quickened us
[22:12] together with Christ. By grace ye are
[22:15] saved, and has raised us up together,
[22:18] and made us to sit in heavenly place.
[22:21] places in Jesus in Christ Jesus that in
[22:25] the ages to come that he might show the
[22:28] exceeding riches of his grace of his
[22:30] kindness towards us through Christ
[22:34] Jesus. For by grace you are saved
[22:37] through
[22:38] faith, that no not that that that not of
[22:42] yourself, but it's the gift of
[22:44] God, not not of works, lest any man
[22:48] should boast. For we are his
[22:51] workmanship,
[22:52] created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
[22:56] which God had before ordained that we
[23:00] should walk in them. Gracious Father, we
[23:02] ask you bless your word to us. We commit
[23:04] it to you in Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[23:06] God bless you. May have your
[23:10] seats. Uh I
[23:14] just perhaps one of the things like we
[23:17] heard the word this
[23:20] morning. Um I want to speak on the
[23:22] benefits of his of the resurrection. The
[23:25] benefits of the resurrection. And and I
[23:28] want to say this barbanam will make the
[23:31] statement that Christianity is based
[23:34] upon resurrection. If there's no
[23:37] resurrection then Christianity is no
[23:39] different from any other religion. It's
[23:42] different from any other uh uh uh people
[23:45] gathering and no not different from the
[23:48] uh uh uh Buddha and Sik and all the
[23:51] others and Muhammad and the rest of
[23:53] them. What makes Christianity different
[23:55] is the fact that we believe in a
[23:58] resurrection. We know that uh out of all
[24:02] that died that no man could raise
[24:04] himself up. We understand that even as
[24:07] we heard it this morning uh that
[24:09] Christianity is the only religion that
[24:12] is that the founder is alive and well
[24:15] and not only the founder but Jesus
[24:18] promised that the same spirit that
[24:19] raised him up will raise you up also.
[24:23] and not only will raise you up but that
[24:25] same spirit abideth in you. So we can
[24:28] certainly say tonight with confidence
[24:30] that you cannot find life in any other
[24:33] religion. Uh any other religion teaches
[24:36] you a code of conduct. The prophet will
[24:39] say a way to live a better life to be a
[24:42] good neighbor uh you know to be a good
[24:44] person here on earth but once you die
[24:46] once you are dead that's the end of it.
[24:49] Christianity is the only religion is the
[24:52] only religion that you are promised
[24:54] eternal life. It would give you eternal
[24:57] life because even the prophet will say
[24:59] on the message that day on Calvary will
[25:01] say that that that day on Calvary that
[25:03] the pro the prophet will say that you as
[25:06] a believer God has given you the ability
[25:09] to impart eternal life to others. So
[25:12] that's the gift of being a Christian.
[25:14] God gives you the eternal life. you are
[25:16] born again of his life and he takes you
[25:19] and and he makes the promise because
[25:21] remember he gives the promise of the
[25:23] father he said that I'm not going to
[25:25] leave you comfortless if it's needful
[25:27] for me to go he told his disciple that
[25:30] if I don't go the holy spirit will not
[25:32] come but if I go I will come back again
[25:36] that was the promise of the father and
[25:39] then he said when I go I'll come back
[25:41] again the spirit will come upon you I'll
[25:43] be with you even in you until the end.
[25:46] So when we become a Christian, when we
[25:48] are born again, we have the promise of
[25:50] that resurrection that the one who
[25:53] walked here on earth, the one who
[25:54] overcame sin, the one who overcame hell,
[25:57] death, and the grave, that same person
[26:00] is abiding in the believer,
[26:03] not a different person, not an
[26:05] understanding of who he is. I I find it
[26:08] so marvelous and and you can probably go
[26:11] back and look at this that in all even
[26:14] all the religion including Christianity
[26:18] resurrection was always something that
[26:20] was taught as something that you would
[26:22] receive until after you die. It it's
[26:24] something that you will do the good
[26:26] works and you will do everything that
[26:28] you can but then after you die your
[26:30] works are weighed and and if you did a
[26:32] lot of good and you know they weigh you
[26:34] and then they decide well this one has
[26:36] to be raised because it was a lot more
[26:38] good than it was bad. It was always
[26:40] presented in a manner that you you had
[26:42] to place in some effort and do some work
[26:45] so you can receive a resurrection. But
[26:48] the prophet when he came on the scene he
[26:51] began to present resurrection in a
[26:53] different manner. And in fact it will
[26:55] talk about quickening power. The power
[26:58] that can come upon the believer to make
[27:00] you alive. Not just in the future but
[27:03] today. Today you can be alive. Today you
[27:06] can be living. Today you can overcome
[27:09] the challenges that are facing you.
[27:11] Today you can become victorious. But
[27:14] that same life that was in Christ will
[27:16] come upon you. So quickening power is
[27:19] the power let me say this every time the
[27:21] word of God is being preached is the
[27:24] presentation or it's a uh uh uh to the
[27:27] believer it's an opportunity to grab
[27:29] hold of the quickening power of God it's
[27:32] not a power that will come after or
[27:34] years after later on but quickening
[27:37] power is that the founder the one who
[27:40] gave this word to you the one who made
[27:42] the promise he's saying that if you
[27:44] receive my promise I will come again I
[27:48] will come behind my word and make it a
[27:50] reality into your life. That's the
[27:54] quickening power of belief. It's the
[27:56] word constantly presenting the
[27:58] quickening power. It doesn't matter what
[28:01] condition you find yourself in. The word
[28:03] of God is here to present quickening
[28:06] power to you. That if you would receive
[28:08] the word, quickening power will be made
[28:10] known unto you. Because as he overcame,
[28:13] so shall we overcome. Because remember
[28:16] the prophet said that as he was so are
[28:18] we in this world. The prophet will even
[28:21] say said the same way that God was in
[28:24] Christ Christ is in you. Not a different
[28:27] you say how was he how was God in
[28:29] Christ. The spirit of God dwelt in
[28:31] Christ and he said I would do nothing
[28:34] except what the father showed me. What
[28:36] he would speak he will speak from what
[28:38] the father told him. What he will do he
[28:40] will do what the father showed him. And
[28:42] he said the same way that he was in the
[28:44] father, Christ is here today in his own
[28:47] people. Amen.
[28:49] So we find out then I was thinking about
[28:51] this and and the opportunity to come we
[28:55] when we come to church or when we hear
[28:57] the word of God we always should be
[28:59] reminded it's not for us to come with
[29:02] some form of intellectual approach where
[29:04] we can gather and go and find out oh
[29:07] what is the word said that I need to do
[29:09] and don't do and go out there to try to
[29:12] practice it. God doesn't work that way.
[29:14] That's education. We receive the word of
[29:17] God. We hear the word of God. Behind
[29:20] that word, there's the person of the
[29:22] word himself who's wanting to make that
[29:24] word manifested to the believer. That's
[29:27] what that's the kind of religion we
[29:29] believe in. That's the kind of God we
[29:31] believe in. Not one that we can just
[29:33] come and say, "Well, he said don't
[29:34] steal, don't drink, and don't do this,
[29:36] and I'm going to go and try to practice
[29:38] and see." No. I let me say this. That
[29:41] kind of religion will not take you far.
[29:43] that kind of religion, you will always
[29:45] find something that you're failing short
[29:47] that you need to do that you need to do.
[29:50] I got to do this and I got to do that.
[29:52] But what the the the the message or the
[29:54] word of God that we've been presented at
[29:56] the end time is a God who comes and he
[29:59] dwells inside of you and make you
[30:02] overcome. He takes the word and he makes
[30:05] you live the word that he himself has
[30:07] given to you.
[30:11] I was uh uh thinking about the the
[30:14] scripture will speak about the story of
[30:15] Lazarus. Uh but but David even mentioned
[30:18] it in passing this morning. Yeah, it was
[30:21] it was dead a good friend of Jesus and
[30:24] oh I love how the prophet will expand so
[30:26] much about here they were uh martyr and
[30:29] them they had left the church and they
[30:31] follow him and they went with him
[30:33] everywhere and they let him live with
[30:35] him and all those things and and yet
[30:38] they were calling upon him and he said
[30:40] come oh that Lazarus is sick and said he
[30:43] said oh I need to go he said that
[30:45] Lazarus is sick they told him and says
[30:47] can you come quickly so he can come, but
[30:50] he had other things to do. And we find
[30:52] out that he waited until Lazarus
[30:54] actually died. And when he showed up and
[30:58] you know all of those at the church that
[31:00] he had left, they came and visited
[31:02] Lazarus and they came and visited them
[31:05] uh at the death of Lazarus. And no doubt
[31:07] they were talking to them and and trying
[31:09] to show how that this man that they had
[31:12] left the church for had left them
[31:14] empty-handed. And there they were
[31:16] finding himself. Perhaps those Pharisees
[31:19] were sitting there saying, "You see, we
[31:21] told you you didn't listen. You You
[31:23] follow after this man. Look at what's
[31:25] going on now. Look, your brother is now
[31:27] dead and he's nowhere to be found." But
[31:30] we understand that Jesus, as the
[31:32] scripture will say, he did nothing
[31:34] except what the father told him. Even
[31:37] after they told him that Lazarus was
[31:39] dead, he turned around and he told them,
[31:41] "He's not dead, but he slipth." So he
[31:44] knew and he did nothing except what the
[31:46] father showed him. So here he comes and
[31:49] and and he comes and everybody's crying
[31:51] and and all those things. And this the
[31:53] prophet will speak about how that that
[31:55] they he came and they came and mur came
[31:59] running up to him and he says, "Oh my,
[32:02] if you only would have been here, my
[32:05] brother would have not died." And he
[32:07] looked at him and he says, "I know he's
[32:09] not dead, but he's not dead, but he's
[32:11] sleeping." It says I know he shall rise
[32:13] again. And then he said he will rise
[32:15] again. He said oh no I believe that
[32:18] sometimes in the future when the
[32:20] resurrection will come. You see that was
[32:23] the mind of men. The understanding of
[32:25] man about resurrection until that time
[32:28] was that it was always an event that
[32:30] will come in the future. It was always
[32:32] something oh my healing will come in the
[32:34] future. My deliverance will come in the
[32:36] future. Whatever I ask it will come in
[32:38] the future sometime in the future. God.
[32:40] He looked at him and said, "No, I Christ
[32:43] that are standing here. I am the
[32:45] resurrection and life." Let me say this,
[32:48] my brother, my sister. The word of God
[32:50] is everything to the believer. It's your
[32:53] deliverance. It's your resurrection. At
[32:56] the time that you receive it, it may not
[32:59] manifest at that minute, but it's
[33:00] everything that you ever needed is in
[33:03] there already.
[33:05] He he he didn't take resurrection and
[33:07] separated it from every other attribute.
[33:10] Resurrection is part of the attribute of
[33:12] who God is. To receive God is to receive
[33:16] the resurrection.
[33:19] So he comes and and and and here he
[33:21] stands and and the scripture says he
[33:23] wept and and all of the people around
[33:26] him began to look and said, "Oh, he must
[33:28] have really loved him. Look at him. He
[33:31] must have really loved him. That's why
[33:32] he's crying." and he said, "Take me to
[33:35] the tomb." They said, "Oh, perhaps he's
[33:36] just going to the tomb so he can cry and
[33:39] see the place where he was buried and
[33:41] everything." It wasn't until he got to
[33:43] the tomb and he asked him to roll away
[33:46] the stone. That's when everybody, oh,
[33:48] wait, we can't do that. He's been dead
[33:50] and for the nose sunk in and you can't
[33:54] do that. It's already smelling and all.
[33:56] He told him to roll away the tomb. And
[33:59] to roll away the tomb, he called out. It
[34:01] says Lazarus come forth. Who was he? He
[34:05] was there manifesting the true
[34:08] resurrection. What life was inside of
[34:11] him being manifested before everybody.
[34:13] Let me say this. The Christianity or the
[34:16] gospel that we have received, it's not
[34:18] in words only. It's in word and
[34:20] manifestation of the spirit. What Jesus
[34:24] spoke, he manifested it. If he talked
[34:27] about healing, he manifested what
[34:29] healing is. We we we that's why the
[34:32] prophet will talk so much. He said the
[34:34] the the problem with men today is we we
[34:37] we have taken the gospel and have turned
[34:40] it into some kind of understanding,
[34:43] intellectual understanding where people
[34:45] will come and and be educated and and
[34:48] they will come so they become church
[34:50] members and all kinds of things. That's
[34:52] not what the word was sent for.
[34:57] In fact, the prophet will say, "We take
[34:59] people to church instead instead of
[35:01] taking them to Christ." Amen. Why? Let
[35:05] me say this. If you come to church,
[35:06] you'll become a church member. But if
[35:08] you come to Christ, you'll become a
[35:10] Christian. Amen.
[35:13] I'm not interested in becoming a church
[35:15] member. I'm interested in one thing is
[35:18] that the life of the resurrected Christ
[35:20] may live in me. Why? That's the promise
[35:23] to the believer. That's the resurrection
[35:26] in
[35:29] manifestation. the
[35:31] the
[35:34] so the prophet will speak and and I was
[35:37] thinking about he speaks in the message
[35:40] I believe this is Easter and he says
[35:42] that he comes and he's rose again and he
[35:46] talk about how many many many men had
[35:49] died and give their lives and many good
[35:52] men they came and some uh they they they
[35:54] healed the sick and and they did great
[35:57] signs and wonders but none of them died
[36:00] and was raised again. None of them was
[36:04] buried and died and lived forever. None
[36:07] of them came and he had this power. So
[36:10] only Christianity has an empty tomb
[36:13] today. Only Christianity has an empty
[36:16] tomb. And it's not so we can just point
[36:19] out to some ancient tomb somewhere, but
[36:21] it's so that we know that that same
[36:24] life, that same spirit that raised
[36:26] Christ is living in you today to make
[36:29] you an overcomer.
[36:31] Without that life, we are no different
[36:33] from any other church.
[36:37] He he talks he said the other religions
[36:40] who said they the they they said but the
[36:44] true
[36:45] Christian true Christianity it begins
[36:48] it's built upon the
[36:51] resurrection. It's not just the
[36:53] resurrection or or a religion that's
[36:55] teaches you how to live good, how to do
[36:58] good, but it's actually constructed upon
[37:02] the resurrection. It's the religion.
[37:04] It's the It's one that's built to
[37:07] produce a life and eternal life. It's
[37:10] one that comes the only the very source
[37:13] of eternal life himself will come and
[37:16] abide within a believer. And outside of
[37:19] that, all you have is
[37:23] perversion. But when I'm going talk
[37:25] about in the Easter Seal, I believe, oh,
[37:27] the rising of the sun, it will say it is
[37:30] the rising of the sun. And when we talk
[37:32] about the rising of the sun, the the the
[37:35] scripture or you look at it the the the
[37:38] in in in in the rising of the sun, it's
[37:41] speaking of a new day. It's speaking
[37:44] about a new hope or a start of something
[37:47] new. It's the promise of the restoration
[37:50] to the believer. It's the hope to the
[37:53] believer that it that God will bring the
[37:56] promise about life and power back into
[37:59] the people. It's an understanding to the
[38:02] believer that it doesn't matter when you
[38:05] say it's the rising of the sun. I was
[38:07] thinking about this in terms of nature.
[38:09] You know the prophet will use that even
[38:12] to illustrate what this rising of the
[38:14] sun means. If if you look at on the
[38:17] daily basis, you can realize that the
[38:19] the presence of the sun of the suan is
[38:24] the declaration to the earth that life
[38:26] will show up because we understand that
[38:29] there's no natural life outside of the
[38:32] sun. If there's no sun, there won't be a
[38:35] natural life. If the sun refuses to come
[38:38] up, there won't be life on earth.
[38:41] Everything is dependent upon the su. The
[38:45] natural life dependent is dependent of
[38:47] the su. And every time the the su comes
[38:51] up, it's a declaration to the
[38:54] vegetation. It's the declaration to the
[38:57] natural life that it doesn't matter what
[39:00] the winter caused, how how dead the seed
[39:03] is and how dead the plants are, how dead
[39:06] the vegetation is, how dead all the
[39:09] trees look like. When the sun comes up,
[39:12] it's a declaration that there will be
[39:14] life again. Amen.
[39:18] So you you when when the sun comes up,
[39:22] you don't have to look at the plant and
[39:24] wonder, oh, I wonder, you are so dead. I
[39:28] don't know if you're going to get
[39:30] life because it's not up to that plant
[39:33] to bring itself up. It's up to the sun.
[39:37] As long as the sun comes up, the sun has
[39:40] the power to warm the ground. The sun
[39:43] has the power to send forth nutrients.
[39:46] The sun has the power to bring about
[39:48] that light, that tree and and take the
[39:51] life that went in the root and bring it
[39:53] right back up. So when the sun comes up
[39:56] is the declaration that life will be on
[39:59] earth again.
[40:03] And the prophet will speak. And it says
[40:06] as people today try to say it
[40:10] said as the people today are trying to
[40:13] say we shouldn't uh we shouldn't wash
[40:17] feet uh we should wash our feet once a
[40:19] year on Thursday or Friday and we should
[40:22] take communion and all different
[40:24] doctrines. They argue about whether it
[40:27] should be this day or that day
[40:29] and whether it should be about Sabbath
[40:32] day or the first day of the week. It
[40:34] says all things are just merely
[40:39] traditions. Think about it. We we're
[40:42] speaking about life and today you can
[40:45] look at all the churches. They plant new
[40:47] flowers. They've done this and and
[40:49] they've done all this. What is it? They
[40:51] just following tradition. Oh, it's
[40:53] another day. we could call it Easter and
[40:55] everything. No, that if you do that, you
[40:58] miss the very point. It's it's a day
[41:01] where you could be reminded that you
[41:04] don't have to be in bondage. You don't
[41:06] have to be in sin. You don't have to
[41:08] remain in sin. And let me say this, it
[41:11] doesn't matter what condition you find
[41:13] yourself in. You say, "Oh, I'm the
[41:15] ranked sinner of all." It doesn't matter
[41:18] what the condition you find yourself in.
[41:21] Easter is a message directly from God to
[41:24] the believer that you could be changed.
[41:27] There's life here today. I'm here to
[41:30] change you. I'm here to resurrect you.
[41:33] I'm here to deliver you. I'm here to
[41:36] bring you out of whatever condition you
[41:38] find yourself in so you can become even
[41:41] like me. He bore your sin. He says he
[41:44] took your place so you can take his
[41:46] place. Amen.
[41:52] It says all things become merely
[41:54] tradition. What good would it do to you
[41:58] whether you had lent or no land if
[42:01] there's no life in
[42:03] you? It's only a memorial which there's
[42:08] nothing against it but they have certain
[42:11] they certainly carried out the tradition
[42:13] and left out the main
[42:15] thing. It says Satan doesn't care how
[42:18] religious you are, how right you are h
[42:21] how right you are in your doctrine. If
[42:24] you miss that life that won't that you
[42:27] won't come up anyhow. No matter how
[42:30] religious, how good, how many, he says
[42:33] how many churches you belong to or you
[42:37] will belong to. It doesn't matter one
[42:40] thing unless you have been born again.
[42:46] Let me say this. The quickening power is
[42:49] not sent to just take us and make us
[42:52] good Christian. The quickening power is
[42:55] the representation of the original life
[42:58] that God had in mind for you.
[43:01] When you are quickened, remember because
[43:03] it says what a resurrection that was.
[43:06] What a resurrection this is. quickening
[43:08] power is sent in the end time to take
[43:11] you and to bring you right back in the
[43:14] original life that God intended for you
[43:17] to live before you even came into
[43:21] manifestation. It's just not merely a
[43:23] life to say, "Oh, I don't sin and I
[43:26] don't lie and I don't do this." It's
[43:28] more than that. It's the life of Christ
[43:30] himself manifested in the believer for
[43:34] you to do the works of Christ.
[43:40] So he talks about the benefit. He says
[43:42] paragraph 31 it says therefore if God
[43:46] raised up Jesus from the dead did he
[43:49] raise him up for a memorial?
[43:53] We can say yes but only that or is he or
[43:57] is it this resurrection morning only one
[44:00] day in the year or a certain day that we
[44:04] celebrate things or we benefactors or
[44:09] are we benefactors of his
[44:12] resurrection? What does it mean to you?
[44:15] What does it mean to you? It says, "Now
[44:18] we believers by
[44:21] faith that he has raised from the dead,
[44:25] but what has what is that to do with
[44:28] me?" It says that was 2,000 years ago.
[44:33] So, it's not merely you saying, "Oh,
[44:36] it's a day in a year that we celebrate."
[44:38] But it has to be something deeper. It
[44:41] has something that a believer has to ask
[44:43] himself. He said, "I claim to be a
[44:46] believer. I claim to believe this thing,
[44:48] but what is this this really mean to me
[44:52] when I say it's Easter? Has my life been
[44:54] affected by this or not?" Because if
[44:56] it's not affected, then it's just a
[44:58] memorial.
[45:01] That is just something we gather and
[45:02] say, "Oh, Christ will came and he died
[45:05] for our sins and so we don't sin
[45:07] anymore. So, we don't." No, but it's
[45:09] deeper than that. He wants us to
[45:11] understand that the power has been made
[45:13] available. Life has been made available.
[45:16] God himself, he take that seed. Remember
[45:19] the prophet say that when Christ was on
[45:21] Calvary, oh my, he he talks and said now
[45:25] when he when the devil took when he took
[45:28] Christ at Calvary, remember Christ, he
[45:31] was not separated from the bride yet. It
[45:35] wasn't until they took that spear and it
[45:37] punk to him. It says that life that was
[45:40] in him came out. In other words, when he
[45:43] died, you died in him. When he was on
[45:46] the cross, you were in him. He took you
[45:48] upon the cross so that in the form that
[45:51] you were, you were in him. You died with
[45:54] him. And when he resurrected, you
[45:56] resurrected with him also.
[46:01] He said the bride cannot be different
[46:03] from the bridegroom. It cannot be Christ
[46:06] is the word and the bridegroom is
[46:08] something else. Those two cannot mix.
[46:10] The bride is exactly what the bridegroom
[46:13] is. If the bridegroom is made of the
[46:15] word, so is the bride.
[46:19] Paragraph 75, he says, "We are
[46:23] benefactors of his
[46:26] resurrection, quickened after being dead
[46:29] in the world in sin and trespass. He has
[46:33] quickened us together with him, raised
[46:36] with him. Now sitting in heavenly places
[46:40] in Christ Jesus, he brings, he says, his
[46:44] spirit brings his same life again on
[46:50] earth, not a different life. His spirit
[46:54] brings his same life again on earth. If
[46:59] the spirit of God that raised of Christ
[47:03] the body, the anointed body, if the
[47:06] spirit of God anointed that body in such
[47:10] a way that when that seed fell into the
[47:13] earth, he just wouldn't let him rest
[47:16] there. No, he quickened him and raised
[47:20] him up. Listen to this. That same spirit
[47:23] by the same works by the same power by
[47:27] the same sign being in you it will raise
[47:30] you up.
[47:33] Oh my brother, my sister, this is not a
[47:36] question whether I will be raised up or
[47:38] not. Let me say this to the believer. My
[47:41] question is not how am I going to go in
[47:43] the ground, how am I going to die,
[47:45] what's going to happen and all of that.
[47:47] My only concern is how am I going to
[47:49] rise? Am I going to write? Let me say
[47:52] this. Because if you live, remember he
[47:55] says this, the only thing that will rise
[47:58] is what is lived according to God's
[48:02] purpose. The only life that God will
[48:06] rise rise again is the life that live
[48:09] according to his own purpose. So it's
[48:11] not how you go in the ground that
[48:13] counts, is how you're going to rise
[48:15] again. And if you have the life of
[48:17] Christ in you, you are guaranteed to
[48:20] raise from the dead.
[48:24] Everything that serve the purpose of
[48:26] God, God will raise up again.
[48:32] He
[48:35] says, he talks about the sun
[48:40] and the sun didn't come up just so we
[48:43] can know that God can raise the
[48:47] sun. Even the coming of the very sun,
[48:50] it's for a purpose. But Ram says it's
[48:53] for a specific
[48:55] purpose. God will raise the sun and the
[48:58] sunshine will see it every day.
[49:00] The sunshine represent God's spoken word
[49:04] and God raises it up for a
[49:07] purpose. And it would
[49:09] say now the
[49:12] sun paragraph
[49:15] 37 at the rising of the sun
[49:18] and there was time when the world was
[49:21] laying in outer
[49:23] darkness. It was without form and was
[49:27] void and it was all covered up with
[49:30] water and was laying there in the dark,
[49:32] dismal, gloomy
[49:36] atmosphere. And I wonder if there's
[49:38] anybody feeling that way. You know, my
[49:41] life is
[49:42] just dark and gloomy and void and
[49:47] without form and I don't know. I don't
[49:49] understand.
[49:52] And here's the prophet just painting the
[49:54] picture. A gloomy atmosphere. It said,
[49:58] "And the spirit of God moved upon the
[50:01] water and said, let there be light." I
[50:05] love this at the next statement. It said
[50:07] God had a reason to do
[50:12] that. Just think about that for a
[50:14] moment. I we we we we I know these are
[50:16] scriptures very thing but he said he's
[50:18] reminding you that God had a reason to
[50:21] do that. You said oh I I I I feel like I
[50:25] don't understand what's going on with my
[50:27] life. God had a reason for doing that.
[50:30] He had a reason for speaking the word.
[50:33] He had a reason for the way things were.
[50:36] He had a reason for the way the the
[50:39] condition of the earth was not something
[50:41] that happens by chance. The way the
[50:44] world find itself void and without form.
[50:47] It wasn't something that the world
[50:48] decided, oh, I want to be void and
[50:50] everything. It it was there for a
[50:53] reason. And above it will say God had a
[50:56] reason for that to to do that. For down
[50:59] beneath the
[51:01] waters, there was seed that he had
[51:04] planted and he had to have that sunlight
[51:08] to make them live.
[51:13] Now, I'm not just talking about the
[51:15] initial creation. I'm talking about you.
[51:17] God had a reason for you to hear this
[51:20] message of the end time.
[51:22] God had a reason. Wherever, however you
[51:25] were born, whatever country you were
[51:27] born in, how you grew up, your life,
[51:30] however messed up it was, God had a
[51:33] reason for it to be that way. For he
[51:36] knew that unless you heard the spoken
[51:39] word, which was the original seed,
[51:42] unless you heard the voice, unless he
[51:44] spoke, you were going to remain in that
[51:46] condition. But he knew that I have a
[51:48] seed that was planted down there. I had
[51:51] a seed just like I had the seed that was
[51:54] planted in the beginning. I have a seed
[51:56] in Laudicia, in the most deceitful age,
[52:00] in the time of darkness, the time of
[52:02] gloomy time, in the time where everybody
[52:05] has rejected the message, have rejected
[52:07] the word, in the most ungodly time that
[52:10] they ever was, God knew that he had
[52:14] seeds in there that he had to send his
[52:16] word to come.
[52:20] You see, we it it wouldn't really uh if
[52:24] we really look at our lives, it doesn't
[52:26] take mystery for you to realize that God
[52:29] has been working with you since you were
[52:31] the beginning. It doesn't really take a
[52:33] mystery for you to look at your own life
[52:35] and see, I didn't come to this church by
[52:38] myself. God brought me here.
[52:43] He He He made things happen. He caused
[52:46] situations to happen. He made a way. He
[52:49] created a way. Let me say this. I some
[52:51] often times say this. Nobody else can
[52:54] put this congregation of these people
[52:56] together. Not by any chance.
[53:03] It was by the revealed word of the hour
[53:05] when God spoke. That's how we heard.
[53:07] That's what brought us into this
[53:09] message. And if we can understand that
[53:12] it was him calling us, then we can
[53:14] understand that it's him walking with
[53:17] us, preparing us for the rapture.
[53:20] This is not a man's effort. This is not
[53:23] man trying to build himself. But this is
[53:25] the program of God that he came and he
[53:27] sent a message so you can hear it and
[53:30] come out of your denomination.
[53:34] A prophet will say paragraph 38 it
[53:37] says the first light that ever shine on
[53:41] the earth was God's spoken word. The
[53:44] first light that ever struck the earth
[53:46] was God's spoken word. He said, "Let
[53:49] there be light." And there was light
[53:52] that turned darkness into light in order
[53:56] to bring forth a creation of joy and
[54:00] life upon the earth. I love that God's
[54:05] creation is not a sad creation. You
[54:08] know, we didn't God didn't create us or
[54:10] didn't call us to be Christians so I can
[54:12] say sorry, you know, I'm just a
[54:14] Christian. You know, I can't be happy.
[54:16] You know what I mean? Have you ever seen
[54:17] those Christian that don't give you a
[54:19] taste of being a Christian at all? You
[54:20] know, they're just, you know, they're
[54:23] just Christian. You know, there's no
[54:25] happiness about them. It's like a burden
[54:27] being a
[54:29] Christian. Think about it. H how would
[54:32] that attract
[54:35] anybody? It says it was a creation of
[54:39] joy and life upon the earth.
[54:44] If you ever look at those small trees
[54:46] when they come when the wind blows,
[54:48] they're the most happiest there is. Why?
[54:51] Because they are they're happy that God
[54:53] created them. Those trees are there to
[54:56] worship God. If you ever look at the
[54:58] sunlight and the sun and the sun is
[55:00] rising and it's complaining, oh, I got
[55:02] to rise again. That's another day. No,
[55:04] it's a happy doing its purpose because
[55:07] it knowing that I it's not just me that
[55:10] count, but I'm a part of a great plan of
[55:13] God that God is unfolding. My brother,
[55:15] my sister, I don't it I don't even know
[55:18] what role I'm playing, but I'm just
[55:20] happy to be part of the family of
[55:23] God. I'm just happy to play my role. I'm
[55:27] just there's nothing that makes you
[55:29] happy than knowing that you've been
[55:31] saved from the the deceitfulness that's
[55:34] going out there.
[55:36] It's by the plan of God. He made that
[55:38] happen. It was by the spirit of God
[55:41] moving. He said in order to bring forth
[55:44] his creation upon the earth, then the
[55:47] spirit of God as he
[55:50] moved with love and compassion
[55:58] You know, I've read the scriptures. I've
[56:00] read this quote so many times, but it
[56:02] hit me different
[56:04] today. It wasn't like, well, if you
[56:07] don't conform to this, then you're not.
[56:09] No, the creation of God was with love
[56:13] and compassion.
[56:15] And in great days, it's just working.
[56:18] And you know when he took that creation
[56:20] perhaps he took it the first time and he
[56:22] looked at it they build it up and
[56:24] perhaps it wasn't exactly what it was
[56:26] looking he breaks it again and he builds
[56:28] it again. He had patience with it. He
[56:31] kept building up in compassion in a
[56:34] great day. The first day of the dawn of
[56:37] creation upon the earth. The sun rose
[56:39] and swep swept across its raid dried up
[56:43] the water from the earth and made an
[56:46] atmosphere above.
[56:50] And for its first
[56:53] time, it was to bring joy and life to
[56:57] the earth by a seed. That was a great
[57:04] hour. Now, the seed didn't
[57:08] say, "Let the water dried up." And the
[57:11] water dried up. No, God dried up the
[57:14] water. God sent the sun to warm the
[57:18] earth up. God provided the atmosphere
[57:21] necessary for the seed to
[57:26] grow. God spoke the word. You were in
[57:30] sin and trespassing somewhere. Somebody
[57:32] said something to you that didn't even
[57:34] make sense. All of a sudden, something
[57:37] hit your heart. What was it? It was God
[57:40] calling you. Butam said this, I believe
[57:42] it's in Easter Seal or the rising of the
[57:44] sun. I can't remember which one of the
[57:46] messages. He's saying that at the end
[57:48] time, he says the Holy Spirit is a
[57:51] hunting for those predestinated seed.
[57:56] It's not you saying, "Oh God, I want to
[57:58] serve you." The very fact that you want
[58:00] to serve God, it means God is calling
[58:03] upon you.
[58:05] It was the Holy Spirit that story. We
[58:08] hear the story of the eagle over and
[58:09] over. the the the the the eiglet on the
[58:13] the the the the barnyard was not looking
[58:16] for the mother eagle.
[58:19] He was there just scratching and
[58:21] scratching and doing the best he can and
[58:23] scratching every day. It wasn't until he
[58:26] heard the voice of the mother eagle,
[58:28] something within a heart strike. And
[58:31] then when something strike, he heard the
[58:33] voice all the other chickens, that voice
[58:36] didn't mean anything to him. But the
[58:38] voice of the eagle to the eaglet, it
[58:41] meant something. The voice of the word
[58:44] of God, the voice of the message, when
[58:46] God speaks to you, it means more to you
[58:49] than anybody.
[58:52] And I want to say this, let's not
[58:55] receive it just a collective voice, but
[58:57] let's also receive it as an individual
[58:59] voice to ourselves.
[59:02] God sent a messenger for all, but he
[59:04] sent a messenger for you. for you
[59:07] specifically. It's your messenger. It's
[59:10] your word. It's your gospel. It's your
[59:12] quickening power.
[59:19] It
[59:21] says, "But
[59:24] oh, that wasn't
[59:27] nothing. That wasn't nothing that
[59:30] sunrise like the sunrise on the Easter
[59:33] morning.
[59:34] This time the sun leaped into the sky,
[59:38] leaped into the sky and it brought forth
[59:41] a great
[59:42] sunrise that ever than ever because it
[59:47] came it came greater
[59:50] news with a
[59:52] sunrise than he did with the sunrise at
[59:55] the beginning. This sunrise brought a
[59:57] news. He is risen. He is quickened from
[1:00:02] the dead as is as is promised. He's
[1:00:06] risen from the dead. The first sunrise
[1:00:09] rose in Genesis and it was bringing the
[1:00:11] message that there will be life upon the
[1:00:14] earth, mortal life. But this time when
[1:00:17] the sun rose, there was a dual sunrise,
[1:00:22] another sun
[1:00:23] s. It was not only the su arising but
[1:00:28] the s has reason to bring eternal life
[1:00:33] to all God's
[1:00:36] promised that by forn knowledge had had
[1:00:39] seen laying upon the earth. No more
[1:00:43] could botney life live back there at the
[1:00:46] beginning without the as she went to
[1:00:48] bring life to bring it to life. No more
[1:00:52] than that than today the sons of God
[1:00:56] upon the earth. It takes the sen light
[1:01:00] to bring them eternal life. He He's
[1:01:03] chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:01:06] foundation of the world. Had he had
[1:01:08] chosen them in himself before the
[1:01:12] foundation of the world.
[1:01:18] It it's
[1:01:20] God coming into
[1:01:23] manifestation wanting to bring his seed
[1:01:26] back
[1:01:27] home. It's
[1:01:30] God coming in greater manifestation so
[1:01:34] we can see the word and the reality of
[1:01:37] the promise that he
[1:01:39] made. It's not us trying to come here
[1:01:42] and say, "Oh God, I want to be changed."
[1:01:44] We It is. is the understanding that
[1:01:48] power has been made available for me to
[1:01:51] live the life of Christ. Power has been
[1:01:54] made available for me to be changed from
[1:01:57] what I was into something new. Power has
[1:02:01] been made available. In fact, when he
[1:02:03] speaks about the sunrise and he speaks
[1:02:05] about the day of Pentecost, he said when
[1:02:07] the Holy Spirit came, the Holy Spirit
[1:02:10] was the power to cause them to do things
[1:02:13] that they otherwise could not do by
[1:02:16] themselves.
[1:02:17] The Holy Spirit when it came on the day
[1:02:20] of Pentecost, Barnam said before that
[1:02:23] there were a bunch of coward. They came
[1:02:25] and they were they hid themselves and
[1:02:27] they were running. But after the Holy
[1:02:29] Spirit came upon them, he said that when
[1:02:32] you shall receive of this spirit, then
[1:02:34] you only can you become my witnesses.
[1:02:39] We can't become witnesses by our own
[1:02:41] effort. He makes us witnesses. How is he
[1:02:44] making out witnesses? By drawing us out
[1:02:46] of sin, taking us out of the things of
[1:02:49] the world. And he himself causing the
[1:02:52] new birth into the life of the believer.
[1:02:55] So you are born again, not of the
[1:02:57] natural, but you are born of the spirit
[1:02:59] of God, so you can live the life of
[1:03:06] God. He
[1:03:09] says, "And now the truth is the
[1:03:13] seal on this sunrise was
[1:03:17] broken and the secret of life after
[1:03:20] death was revealed." Before that time he
[1:03:25] didn't know the world groped in darkness
[1:03:28] and groped around and men's suspicion
[1:03:31] theory
[1:03:32] among men's heart and tradition made up.
[1:03:36] Men worship idols. They worshiped the
[1:03:39] sun. They worship all kinds of gods and
[1:03:42] and all kinds of people made claims.
[1:03:46] They all went into the grave and they
[1:03:48] stayed in the grave. But the real seal
[1:03:52] had broke had been had been
[1:03:55] broken and
[1:03:57] once and one and one who once lived as
[1:04:02] we lived died as we died was risen from
[1:04:06] the dead that mo what what a morning.
[1:04:09] Never one like that in all the history
[1:04:12] of the world. The secret was made known
[1:04:17] that he was born. He was both the
[1:04:20] resurrection and the
[1:04:27] life. He walked on earth
[1:04:30] and he lived an overcoming
[1:04:33] life. He came and he was the first born
[1:04:37] among many brethren. He was one who came
[1:04:41] and he showed us what life what what to
[1:04:44] live in overcoming life means. He was
[1:04:47] one who came and he was the very
[1:04:50] predestinated seed of God to come so he
[1:04:54] can bring many into glory. He was the
[1:04:56] life of God that was given for the
[1:05:00] purpose of dying for an offering. And he
[1:05:03] didn't stop there because we understand
[1:05:05] as the prophet will talk about it. Those
[1:05:07] that came before him, they were all held
[1:05:10] by death. There was no power that was
[1:05:13] greater than the power of death that
[1:05:15] Satan possessed. But speaks in the
[1:05:17] message the power of death. It said that
[1:05:20] all that the men came and they will do
[1:05:22] great things and everything but when
[1:05:24] they died death held them
[1:05:27] captive. It seems like what they didn't
[1:05:30] matter what they did they couldn't break
[1:05:32] forth past the power of death. Whatever
[1:05:35] they did when they died death had the
[1:05:39] power to hold them up. But here come one
[1:05:42] who came and he had the power over
[1:05:46] death. He had the power over uh hell and
[1:05:50] he had power over the grave. So when he
[1:05:52] came he went the scripture says when he
[1:05:55] was crucified it said that he came and
[1:05:57] he died that God took him and it says he
[1:06:00] went to hell. In fact the scripture will
[1:06:03] speak about how that he went into the
[1:06:05] region of the lost and he came and he
[1:06:08] ministered unto them that were there.
[1:06:10] What was he? He was the very word
[1:06:12] himself manifested. He was the prophecy
[1:06:15] of everything that the prophet has
[1:06:17] talked
[1:06:19] about. A son shall be
[1:06:22] born. The government will be upon his
[1:06:25] shoulder. That it will be at the name of
[1:06:27] this one that all shall be saved. He was
[1:06:30] one that was given to come and to break
[1:06:33] the power over death. And when he did
[1:06:36] that, he came and he was manifested so
[1:06:40] we can receive the same life that was in
[1:06:43] him. So to be a believer is to be one
[1:06:46] that's identified with him not only in
[1:06:49] his death but to also be identified with
[1:06:52] him in his resurrection.
[1:06:58] What about
[1:07:05] said now as the sun was sent across the
[1:07:09] earth not to bring the rocks or the dirt
[1:07:13] also or the rocks which was the dirt
[1:07:17] also to
[1:07:20] life. It was not to bring all the dirt
[1:07:23] to life, but it was to bring the part of
[1:07:26] the dirt which was enclosed around the
[1:07:30] life. Not all men will receive Christ,
[1:07:34] but oh no, but those which for
[1:07:39] ordained that God for ordained
[1:07:42] life in housed around some of the
[1:07:46] dirt of the earth. That's the one he
[1:07:51] come to
[1:07:52] quaken. They are the ones says that now
[1:07:56] that dirt would lay there in the sun and
[1:08:00] say, "Oh, this old son is so
[1:08:03] hot." That rock says, "This old sun is
[1:08:06] so hot." But that little seed said,
[1:08:11] "That's what I'm looking for."
[1:08:16] No, notice the
[1:08:17] difference. It the what maybe says, "Oh,
[1:08:21] what does he think he is?" And you know,
[1:08:23] people, but the the little seed will
[1:08:25] look at the same exact message, the same
[1:08:28] exact word. While others are looking at
[1:08:30] it and say, "Oh, that's too much. I
[1:08:31] can't take that." The seed will look at
[1:08:33] it and say, "That's exactly what I'm
[1:08:36] looking for."
[1:08:39] You hear the message for the first time.
[1:08:41] and he said, "This must be God
[1:08:43] speaking." Another one looks at him and
[1:08:46] says, "I never hear such
[1:08:48] nonsense." What makes the difference?
[1:08:51] One is a
[1:08:52] rock, one is a dirt, and the other is a
[1:08:56] seed.
[1:08:59] You know, it's not by one who welleth or
[1:09:03] runth, but it's by God who shows mercy.
[1:09:07] That's why we don't judge somebody by
[1:09:10] the looks or by the understanding and
[1:09:12] say, "Oh, because you know the message
[1:09:13] that means you." No, it's God who shows
[1:09:16] mercy.
[1:09:19] What what really matters at the end of
[1:09:21] the day is has God really spoken to you?
[1:09:25] Is God really touching your heart? Is
[1:09:27] this message really working in you? It's
[1:09:29] not how intellectual we can get. It's
[1:09:31] how close we can get to him. His life
[1:09:34] living in us.
[1:09:39] The the problem with intellect
[1:09:41] is it always finds a way to reason the
[1:09:44] word of God. It always find a way to
[1:09:47] look for more intellect. You know, you
[1:09:49] you read and then now you're going to
[1:09:51] need something more to read and then
[1:09:53] you're going to need something more. But
[1:09:54] a life that when when you have life,
[1:09:57] every word will only come and feed upon
[1:10:00] that same life and it will grow. When
[1:10:03] you have life, every word of God speaks
[1:10:05] to you. When you have life, everything
[1:10:08] that's spoken will feed you. Why?
[1:10:10] Because you have life inside of you. And
[1:10:13] the Holy Spirit only feeds upon the
[1:10:15] word. That's right.
[1:10:19] It
[1:10:22] says, "And it begins to spring forth to
[1:10:26] life. It's quick. It quickened that part
[1:10:29] of the dirt because the son that was
[1:10:32] sent not to quicken the the sun uh the
[1:10:37] son was not sent to quicken the rock not
[1:10:40] to quicken the dirt but to quicken the
[1:10:43] life of the seed. Now the Holy Spirit
[1:10:46] comes now. Of course he wasn't sent.
[1:10:51] Why? He says when all the people receive
[1:10:54] it, it wasn't sent to them. A guy told
[1:10:58] me, "I don't believe. I don't care what
[1:11:01] you will say. If you if you could raise
[1:11:05] up the dead or anything or heal the sick
[1:11:07] and and prove it uh in any way, I still
[1:11:12] don't believe it." I said certainly not.
[1:11:16] You are an
[1:11:17] unbeliever. I don't mean a thing. It
[1:11:20] says it don't mean a thing to you. It
[1:11:23] wasn't even sent to uh to you. It was it
[1:11:26] was it was it's sent to those who will
[1:11:29] believe. The message is to the believer.
[1:11:33] To them that perish, it's foolishness.
[1:11:37] But to them that are in Christ and and
[1:11:40] part of the seed, it's life.
[1:11:49] Is it feeding you? Is it guiding you? Is
[1:11:52] it giving you instruction? Is it giving
[1:11:55] you quickening power? You know this
[1:11:57] quickening power is not once and done.
[1:12:00] And as people have even sometimes the
[1:12:02] the the purpose of this the quickening
[1:12:05] is to quicken you from when you are seed
[1:12:08] until rapture.
[1:12:11] the the that's why the prophet said we
[1:12:13] can never overemphasize the importance
[1:12:16] of revelation. What is revelation is God
[1:12:19] continually quickening you. What is he
[1:12:21] doing? He quickens you because every He
[1:12:25] knows what you need at every step. He
[1:12:28] knows what you need at every junction.
[1:12:30] The sun just lays in the presence of the
[1:12:32] sun and the sun will continually bake
[1:12:35] it, bake it until it will produce what
[1:12:39] the sun is looking for, which is the
[1:12:41] perfect fruit.
[1:12:43] It's not, oh, I have been quickened and
[1:12:45] I don't need no more. No, every time you
[1:12:47] come in contact with the word of God, I
[1:12:50] pray that you let the quickening power,
[1:12:53] let's not approach the word of God by
[1:12:55] our intellect or by understanding, but
[1:12:57] let the quickening power that was spoken
[1:13:00] along with the word of God, which is the
[1:13:03] very spirit of God himself, to come and
[1:13:06] quicken every part of it.
[1:13:15] It
[1:13:24] said, "And when we see not a
[1:13:27] denomination, not a PhD, not an LLD, not
[1:13:29] a good neighbor, but a son of God molded
[1:13:34] in the image of
[1:13:36] God with the dynamic power of God to
[1:13:40] answer the request. rest of this
[1:13:43] day that is the same yesterday, today
[1:13:46] and
[1:13:47] forever. There ain't no hen going hold
[1:13:53] you. He hunts for his
[1:13:56] mama. He's an eagle to begin with. He
[1:14:01] recognizes the real eagle recognized the
[1:14:04] call of God's word. Why? He's an eagle.
[1:14:08] An eagle to an eagle. The word before
[1:14:11] the foundation, the
[1:14:13] word to the word, the word predestinated
[1:14:18] to the word written from the for the
[1:14:21] hour. You realize your position. He
[1:14:25] hunts for it.
[1:14:33] I I just from my own
[1:14:36] heart, I want the quickening power of
[1:14:39] God in me to do the works of Christ in
[1:14:43] me. Not what I perceive to be the works
[1:14:46] of Christ, but what was intended, what
[1:14:49] God intended for the quickening power to
[1:14:53] do. I think people have taken it, we've
[1:14:56] changed it. it becoming uh uh almost
[1:14:59] something
[1:15:00] that just the ability to raise the dead,
[1:15:03] to heal the sick and to do all those
[1:15:05] things and then to claim you have
[1:15:06] quickening power. Quickening power is to
[1:15:09] bring you into the manifestation of what
[1:15:12] God wanted you to be and so you can do
[1:15:16] the works of Christ that he intended for
[1:15:19] you to do.
[1:15:26] But when will speak about the sheave
[1:15:28] wave offering if the musician could
[1:15:32] come. He will speak about the she wave
[1:15:35] offering and
[1:15:38] say he speak about the book of
[1:15:40] Leviticus. It will say that they the
[1:15:43] word that when the field was planted
[1:15:47] that there will come a time
[1:15:49] when there would one will go into his
[1:15:52] field and after everything was planted.
[1:15:56] It was and he will speak how that it was
[1:15:59] not on the uh uh uh the Sabbath. It was
[1:16:01] the seventh day but the fir it was the
[1:16:04] first day which was called the Sunday.
[1:16:07] And it will come into the field and and
[1:16:09] it will take the first fruit of what was
[1:16:13] planted. And it will take it so it could
[1:16:16] be an identification to all. So they
[1:16:20] would know that the same seed that was
[1:16:22] planted into the field, what is it is it
[1:16:25] was planted for, that it would produce
[1:16:27] the same thing as the first fruit. That
[1:16:30] they would take it and they will bring
[1:16:31] it into the congregation and they will
[1:16:34] wave it before the people. So everyone
[1:16:37] can look and have confidence and know
[1:16:40] that that oh when the harvest time will
[1:16:43] come, when our harvest will come, when
[1:16:45] the time for harvest will come, this is
[1:16:47] what we have to expect to see as the
[1:16:50] fruits of what we planted.
[1:16:56] You you know I love it even our pastor
[1:16:58] mentioned it this morning. I I would
[1:17:01] hate to be a Christian and only to find
[1:17:05] out what my destination is at the end of
[1:17:09] my
[1:17:09] journey. I would hate to try my best all
[1:17:13] my life and to try to do everything that
[1:17:15] I can and only to find out exactly what
[1:17:19] where you're going and what what's about
[1:17:21] your life and everything at the end of
[1:17:23] it. God didn't build it to be that way.
[1:17:26] The devil wanted it to be that way, but
[1:17:28] God don't.
[1:17:32] God has given you an identification
[1:17:35] today. In fact, the scripture says that
[1:17:38] he's given you the Holy Spirit has a
[1:17:41] sign for you to know that you have has
[1:17:45] received a ticket of what the full
[1:17:48] redemption is going to look like.
[1:17:51] The Holy Spirit is only given to you as
[1:17:55] a a a ticket or even as a a a taste of
[1:18:00] what it would be for your full
[1:18:02] redemption. So when you come as a
[1:18:04] believer, when you are born again, you
[1:18:08] experience God in a way that no man out
[1:18:11] other man can understand. And that to
[1:18:14] you is uh is given to you so you would
[1:18:17] know that God is walking with you.
[1:18:20] It's not given so you can go and doubt
[1:18:22] about it and dispute with somebody. Did
[1:18:25] you really meet God? How was he to you?
[1:18:27] How was it to me? No, it's a personal
[1:18:30] experience.
[1:18:32] So you can know he's talking to you.
[1:18:34] It's not an experience to be compared
[1:18:36] with other people.
[1:18:42] How big is your experience compared to
[1:18:44] mine?
[1:18:46] And that's what I see most of the time
[1:18:47] with the young people. You know, they
[1:18:49] hear the stories about perhaps one was
[1:18:51] in drugs and was in this and they came
[1:18:53] out and yet here they are sitting in the
[1:18:55] bench in the pro uh in the church and
[1:18:58] and feeling like, "Oh, I I need some big
[1:19:00] things for me to know that God," if the
[1:19:03] word of God is talking to your heart,
[1:19:05] God is in you.
[1:19:11] It's the same God. He He wants He's the
[1:19:15] God of variety. is the god of the the
[1:19:18] the ones that went into the world. He's
[1:19:20] the one that he kept from the the the
[1:19:22] the other thing. The prophet didn't do
[1:19:27] drugs. So you don't have to go that way
[1:19:29] to know that God is with you. But what
[1:19:31] he wants you is that you as an
[1:19:33] individual, you are convinced in your
[1:19:36] heart that you've met him.
[1:19:39] I know I have met him. I didn't my the
[1:19:42] desire in me didn't come from myself.
[1:19:45] Somebody put it in there. I don't come
[1:19:47] to church because somebody tells me it's
[1:19:49] time to come to church. I don't worship
[1:19:51] him because somebody tells me to worship
[1:19:53] him. There's something burning in my
[1:19:56] heart. I want to serve him with
[1:19:58] everything I have. I'm giving everything
[1:20:00] that I have. It's a personal experience.
[1:20:04] It's God making himself known. In fact,
[1:20:09] I even remember the prophet will speak
[1:20:11] when he came where all of those uh uh
[1:20:14] men of old where they were hidden or or
[1:20:16] held off by death. When he came when he
[1:20:19] began to look at each one, they
[1:20:22] recognize him on each one by a different
[1:20:25] experience.
[1:20:27] Abraham looked at him and says, "Oh,
[1:20:28] Sarah, look, that's the man that came
[1:20:31] and sit under the tree. That's the man
[1:20:34] that I came and there was three of them
[1:20:36] and I recognized him to be Elohim.
[1:20:40] When Ezekiel looked at him, he didn't
[1:20:43] look at him through Abraham's
[1:20:44] experience. He looked at him through his
[1:20:47] own experience and said, "Oh, that's the
[1:20:49] wheel in the middle of the wheel. I
[1:20:51] recognize him." When Daniel saw him, it
[1:20:54] was a different experience from the
[1:20:55] other. Why? It was the same God yet
[1:20:58] different experience for each one of
[1:21:00] them.
[1:21:02] Why? because it was personal.
[1:21:07] They could stand there and
[1:21:08] say, "One day I was under the tree. One
[1:21:12] day I was in such and such and place.
[1:21:14] One day I was bound in sin. I remember
[1:21:17] you came to me. You took me out of that
[1:21:20] place. You did this for me. You that
[1:21:23] that's your identification with him."
[1:21:27] And nobody else can copy that.
[1:21:32] I love him. That's the kind of God he
[1:21:35] is. He wants you to know him for
[1:21:38] yourself. When we going to meet him,
[1:21:40] we're not going to talk about the story
[1:21:42] of each one. Each one will have his
[1:21:44] individual connection with him to say,
[1:21:47] "Oh, I remember. It was you that talked
[1:21:50] to me that day. It was you that did this
[1:21:53] for me that day." when I was sick and
[1:21:55] bound in in a sickness in bed and I
[1:21:58] didn't know how to do I all of the
[1:22:00] sudden I read my Bible all of the sudden
[1:22:02] the scripture spoke to me and all of the
[1:22:05] sudden I felt well you what is that
[1:22:08] that's your personal connection with him
[1:22:13] he wants us to move from quickening
[1:22:15] power to quickening power to quickening
[1:22:17] power doesn't want us to just say oh I I
[1:22:21] remember him just 30 years ago but I
[1:22:24] Don't remember him today.
[1:22:26] No, he wants to quicken you every day of
[1:22:30] your life. Why? Because is the same
[1:22:33] yesterday, today, and forever. The same
[1:22:37] Christ manifested. And the prophet will
[1:22:40] say paragraph 94 it says as Christ was
[1:22:45] one first raised first to be raised from
[1:22:49] all the prophets and so forth although
[1:22:52] the type of many places he was the first
[1:22:57] he was the first fruit of those that
[1:22:59] slept. It says now in the bride coming
[1:23:03] of Christ coming out of the
[1:23:07] church there will be a sheave wave again
[1:23:12] in the last day. How many has seen that
[1:23:15] she wave in the last day?
[1:23:20] This is not history. This is a reality.
[1:23:24] We have seen God in our generation.
[1:23:28] And not only that, we I'm I'm I'm
[1:23:31] standing up here and looking at God.
[1:23:33] Amen. This is the work of God. This is
[1:23:36] God manifesting in the end time. He came
[1:23:41] by the shewave offering. He came and he
[1:23:44] spoke to us and we have received him and
[1:23:46] he came out of the dark denomination.
[1:23:49] The prophet said he began to call out of
[1:23:51] every tongue, every nation, every
[1:23:53] kindred. He's gathering a people for
[1:23:56] himself.
[1:23:59] Now, if you see him the prophet in the
[1:24:00] prophet and you're failing to see him
[1:24:02] tonight, that's a problem.
[1:24:06] Because if you see him the prophet, you
[1:24:08] have to see him in yourself. You have to
[1:24:11] see him in your life. And if you don't,
[1:24:14] he's here to make himself known unto
[1:24:16] you.
[1:24:19] Let's all stand.
[1:24:21] [Music]
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] I don't know about
[1:24:33] you, I long for a fresh experience every
[1:24:37] day. You know, sometimes I feel like a
[1:24:39] kid. You know,
[1:24:41] when someone come and, you know, you see
[1:24:44] somebody receive the Lord and and
[1:24:47] they're being baptized and everything, I
[1:24:49] just want to feel like the same way
[1:24:50] again. You
[1:24:51] know, I want a fresh experience every
[1:24:54] day. I want a fresh touch every morning.
[1:24:58] I want to know that he's walking with
[1:24:59] me. I want to know that he's leading me.
[1:25:02] He's guiding me. I want to know that
[1:25:03] he's talking to me every day. I don't
[1:25:06] want to just live a life where I will
[1:25:08] find out sometime down the road, but I
[1:25:11] want the Lord to walk with me every step
[1:25:14] of the way. Amen. Not sure what song
[1:25:17] you're singing.
[1:25:19] I have no idea what that song

[1:29:56] long
[1:30:00] for. You have
[1:30:04] given
[1:30:06] life
[1:30:13] to Amen. I love that word. Don't you?
[1:30:17] Beautiful, beautiful word. you know, we
[1:30:21] it I I just don't think
[1:30:23] that we really take the time to look at
[1:30:26] all that he's done for us. You know, we
[1:30:29] we we'd just be a lot happier.
[1:30:32] you know, they
[1:30:35] they're talking that so in sports world
[1:30:41] now there's big confusion going on
[1:30:45] because everybody's transferring to the
[1:30:49] team that they think will
[1:30:51] win. You know what I mean? So, they're
[1:30:54] leaving this team and going to this team
[1:30:56] because they think that team's going to
[1:30:57] be the winner and this guy's running
[1:31:00] here and everybody's running to and fro
[1:31:03] trying
[1:31:03] to trying to find the winning
[1:31:07] team and and God picked you. You're the
[1:31:11] winning team,
[1:31:14] you know? I mean, okay. And it's not
[1:31:18] because you had anything to do with
[1:31:20] it, because he chose you. That's right.
[1:31:25] And you know, yeah, you you look at
[1:31:28] yourself and you
[1:31:30] think, I mean, I I'm I'm just not very
[1:31:33] good. But he knows what he's doing. He
[1:31:37] knows what he paid for. He He He'll
[1:31:40] He'll transform you.
[1:31:43] look deep in your heart and if you
[1:31:45] really love God and the things of God
[1:31:48] and you really want to go to heaven then
[1:31:51] that's all you got to do is just present
[1:31:53] your heart to him and he'll take over
[1:31:57] you know and that's what they he said
[1:31:59] you know if you love the world and the
[1:32:01] things of the world the love of God's
[1:32:04] not in you I mean you may even be a
[1:32:09] little worldly but if it bugs you and it
[1:32:11] bothers you and you want to be free from
[1:32:14] it, you just might consider there's a
[1:32:17] God that'll make you free. That's right.
[1:32:19] Yeah. He'll certainly take care of you.
[1:32:21] So, we're certainly glad for that word
[1:32:24] tonight. I know that uh I I don't know
[1:32:27] what time it is right now. What time is
[1:32:30] it? 6:40. It's what? 6:40. So, it's
[1:32:34] 6:40. So, uh it's probably about an hour
[1:32:37] and a half till the kids get here. So,
[1:32:40] what we'll do is we'll just open up the
[1:32:42] fellowship hall. We'll put on a pot of
[1:32:45] coffee or uh hot water for tea or
[1:32:49] whatever. And uh uh we can just
[1:32:52] fellowship there. If you want to run up
[1:32:54] and get something to eat, uh you can uh
[1:32:58] bring it back to uh the church if you
[1:33:01] want to eat there. If you want to all
[1:33:04] run up to Andes and get a ice cream
[1:33:07] cone, I'll buy you all an ice cream
[1:33:09] cone. So, uh, we and so we'll just some
[1:33:13] of you will wait for your kids to come
[1:33:15] and the young people to come back. So,
[1:33:19] uh, we'll just have a good time of
[1:33:21] fellowship from them. Okay. All right.
[1:33:24] So, let's go ahead and bow our heads in
[1:33:26] prayer and ask the Lord to be with us.
[1:33:29] Our gracious heavenly father, we've
[1:33:32] heard such wonderful word
[1:33:35] and we just trust
[1:33:37] that we'll receive it, Father, as our
[1:33:41] own personal
[1:33:44] message. You speaking to
[1:33:47] us, Father,
[1:33:49] about performing what you promised you'd
[1:33:52] perform.
[1:33:53] And Father, that we might come to know
[1:33:56] our
[1:33:57] part in the great plan of redemption.
[1:34:01] Father, that we'll never compare
[1:34:03] ourselves with another, but each of our
[1:34:10] experiences will be personal. So we just
[1:34:14] trust that you would bless us this
[1:34:15] evening. Continue to guide the church
[1:34:19] home safely. And we just trust, Father,
[1:34:22] that you will bless us now in this time
[1:34:25] of dismissal. We just ask you to be with
[1:34:28] us in your precious and holy name we
[1:34:31] pray. Amen. Amen. I I like this song. I
[1:34:36] don't know it, but if you can put it on
[1:34:38] the board and and Billy will sing real
[1:34:42] loud, we might be able to sing this
[1:34:45] song. Amen.
[1:34:54] He came
[1:34:56] to the word of life. He came to die.
[1:35:05] Oh, he came to
[1:35:08] rise to show his power and
[1:35:13] might. That's why we praise him. That's
[1:35:17] why we
[1:35:19] sing. That's why we offer him our
[1:35:26] everything. That's why
[1:35:29] we worship this
[1:35:31] king. Heat. Heat.
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:50] God bless
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:36:00] you. Heat. Heat.
[1:36:10] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:24] That's why
[1:36:26] we
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:41] worship. Before we
[1:36:43] go, if you want a ice
[1:36:46] cream, I'll be there for in about 20
[1:36:50] minutes.
[1:36:52] and come right up so we can get your ice
[1:36:55] cream and I'll get the fellowship all
[1:36:58] open for you. God bless you. Go
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:09] peace.
[1:37:21] [Music]
[1:37:33] Heat. Hey, heat. Hey,
[1:37:36] heat.
[1:37:50] Heat.
[1:37:58] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:38:03] [Music]
