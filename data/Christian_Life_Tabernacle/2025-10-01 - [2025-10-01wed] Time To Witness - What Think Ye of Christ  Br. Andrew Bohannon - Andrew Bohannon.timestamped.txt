[9:46] Hallelujah.
[9:48] Heaven and earth will pass away, but my
[9:51] word shall never pass away. Aren't you
[9:53] glad you have something that you can
[9:54] hold on to tonight? I'm holding to his
[9:57] word. I'm holding to God's hand. Amen.
[10:00] So good to be gather in his presence.
[10:02] Brother David Junior, if I could just
[10:03] come and open our service in prayer.
[10:05] Amen. Want to welcome all our visitors.
[10:07] And Amen. How many are happy to be in
[10:09] the house of God tonight? Amen. Let me
[10:12] tell you, that's where all the blessings
[10:13] are. Amen.
[10:18] Let's go before him in prayer. Heavenly
[10:20] Father, we're so thankful for this
[10:21] promised place that we can gather, Lord.
[10:23] And under the name of our Lord and
[10:25] Savior Jesus Christ, Father, and Lord,
[10:28] know that heavens and earth can pass
[10:30] away, but the word we're going to feed
[10:32] on tonight, Lord, it's going to it's
[10:34] going to secure us, Father. It's not
[10:35] going to fade away. And Lord, we can
[10:37] look to it to have confidence, Father,
[10:39] in times that are uncertain, Lord. And
[10:42] where man's hearts are failing and
[10:44] there's things that just would confound
[10:46] this mind, Father. We're more sure than
[10:48] any other people, Lord, where we're
[10:50] standing and the hour we're in and the
[10:52] day and age that we're in. And Father,
[10:54] we're thankful for that tonight. And
[10:56] Lord, as we're gathered, Lord, we're not
[10:57] just going to let this be another
[10:59] service, Father, but we're pressing,
[11:00] Lord, into you, Lord. There's needs we
[11:03] have in our hearts, Father. And we're
[11:04] inviting your presence. And Lord, where
[11:06] you are, there's good things, Father.
[11:08] And Lord, Satan can't stand against us.
[11:11] Lord, as two or three, we come and
[11:13] Father, we agree on any one thing we
[11:15] could have, what we would ask for,
[11:17] Father. And we're asking that you'd move
[11:18] in a mighty way in this service, Lord.
[11:20] That you'd start now just to take us
[11:22] beyond these carnal realms, Father. And
[11:24] Lord, draw us and make us aware we're
[11:26] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[11:28] Jesus. Father, our position as sons and
[11:30] daughters of God to have your favor,
[11:33] Lord, to know that you love us. And
[11:35] Lord, you're mindful of the needs that
[11:36] we have. And Lord, this could be the
[11:38] last opportunity that we could even have
[11:40] to gather together. And Lord, we want to
[11:42] take full advantage of it, Lord. And
[11:44] Lord, I'm asking, Lord, that you'd
[11:46] forgive me, Father, of anything that
[11:47] would hinder, Lord. And Lord, each one,
[11:49] we plead the blood of Jesus Christ. And
[11:52] Lord, we ask, God, that you would just
[11:54] come and be pleased to move amongst your
[11:56] people. Lord, we've set this place aside
[11:58] for you. And Lord, we've dedicated it
[12:00] unto you. And Lord, there's many who've
[12:02] made an effort to be here tonight. And
[12:04] Father, we know you're going to be
[12:06] faithful. Lord, we can't outgive you. So
[12:08] come, Lord, have your will and way in
[12:10] this service. We commit it to you. In
[12:11] the mighty name of our Lord and Savior
[12:13] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Why don't you turn around
[12:18] tonight and just welcome someone in the
[12:21] house of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[12:27] Amen.
[12:28] F. Amen. Why don't we sing when the roll
[12:30] is called up yonder there? I'll be
[12:31] there. Amen.
[12:34] I think it's F. Yeah. May have your
[12:36] seats.
[12:40] Oh, and the trumpet of the Lord shall
[12:43] sound and time shall be no more. And the

[21:51] uh he has a special tonight. Right after
[21:53] that, Sister Sarah will bring hers.
[21:55] Amen.
[22:52] God bless you,
[22:55] man. I um help me God. I just wanted to
[22:59] share a testimony. Uh I've been going
[23:01] through
[23:03] some transition at work and
[23:07] you know I've met quite a lot of smart
[23:10] people you know in the field that I work
[23:12] in you meet them and you meet people
[23:15] that says you know I've passed this many
[23:18] tests I have this many certification
[23:21] to make it wherever I am at but I'm not
[23:24] one of those people you know because
[23:27] probably not as smart as they are and
[23:32] you know it has been just a blessing to
[23:34] be in the journey that I'm in but the
[23:36] testimony is as of the last two weeks
[23:39] we've been trying to deploy some changes
[23:43] and I haven't been able to sleep I've
[23:46] just been under stress because I work in
[23:48] a team that I'm just me myself in the
[23:51] position
[23:53] I was working in the company as a
[23:55] contractor and then it got to a time
[23:57] where
[24:00] It was last week to the very brink the
[24:03] weekend. So right after that weekend the
[24:07] contract ended and I have to get back in
[24:10] the job market
[24:12] or I have to apply somewhere else to
[24:14] work at a McDonald or whatever. You know
[24:16] I'm not that big for McDonald's. I will
[24:18] apply and work. But I was crying in my
[24:21] heart with my wife. We were just praying
[24:23] you know that the Lord open a way. Up
[24:25] until that last week, believe we had uh
[24:28] we had one of our moms at home. My wife
[24:31] was doing her hair and the manager calls
[24:34] me and says, "David, we didn't have a
[24:36] position. We don't even have a position
[24:38] for you in the company. We didn't have
[24:41] this position,
[24:43] but we're going to create one just for
[24:45] you."
[24:47] Uh
[24:48] I don't I don't I don't know you know
[24:51] when you share it sounds so good but you
[24:54] know going through that process it's
[24:56] very you know the strain the stress and
[24:59] he just looks at me says no we just
[25:00] created it for you and they gave me
[25:04] exactly the offer that me and my wife
[25:07] prayed for
[25:09] &gt;&gt; before leaving North Dakota from the
[25:10] beginning I was like from for this
[25:12] amount we'll pack everything
[25:16] right to the numbers. I tried to debate
[25:19] a little bit. Can you you know just be a
[25:21] little selfish but it was like this is
[25:23] really we just this is a miracle. It's
[25:26] even have to be approved. I was just
[25:28] like, I'll take it, you know. And then I
[25:30] I didn't want to show like it was too
[25:32] much, but it was.
[25:39] [Applause]
[25:40] And then as of the last two weeks in
[25:43] that very position, I ran into a
[25:46] roadblock. Something that I didn't
[25:48] understand how to do. Neither did my
[25:50] boss or anybody. They didn't think it
[25:52] was possible. So, they just give it to
[25:54] me so I can spend these two weeks in
[25:56] Spain.
[25:58] And
[25:59] you know we were praying one night we
[26:01] were supposed to go to the the house
[26:04] where we go minister and one night they
[26:06] asked me to work overnight all the way.
[26:09] So from the morning all the way from 8
[26:12] to 6:00 a.m. in the morning to maintain
[26:15] you know things that are going in
[26:16] production
[26:18] and I just was crying. My wife was
[26:20] praying for me. It's going to be okay.
[26:22] God will help you. And one day just
[26:25] messing around with the code, I just put
[26:28] things that I didn't even know where I
[26:29] got it from. And then it worked.
[26:33] My manager came by. I was like, because
[26:36] I've spoken to him about the prophet. He
[26:38] knows the prophet, but he just believes
[26:41] what he saw online about him. I was
[26:43] like, "Hey, look, I know you know about
[26:46] God, but David didn't do it. God did
[26:49] this one." you know, and I've been I was
[26:52] trying to sing the song, you know, hold
[26:55] to God's unchanging hands, but we sing
[26:57] it already, so I have to find another
[26:58] one. Um, just to say thank you.
[27:02] This song, I I wrote it when I was going
[27:05] through a lot of hard time, you know, a
[27:08] few years back. Just reminds me of the
[27:10] grace of God.

[31:21] [Music]
[31:34] Oh. all want their lives
[31:40] to count for something
[31:47] to leave
[31:49] them more.
[31:55] Life is through,
[32:01] but vain pursuit
[32:07] [Music]
[32:08] will count for nothing.
[32:15] Time will
[32:17] grace
[32:20] [Music]
[32:22] whatever
[32:24] we do.
[32:28] And I want my life
[32:36] to count for Jesus.
[32:40] [Music]
[32:43] For earthly
[32:45] things
[32:49] will quickly
[32:52] fade.
[32:53] [Music]
[32:56] No need
[32:58] to bow
[33:03] to worldly
[33:06] treasures.
[33:07] [Music]
[33:10] God only
[33:13] see
[33:16] [Music]
[33:17] eternal
[33:19] gain.
[33:23] [Music]
[33:24] Inside
[33:26] my heart
[33:28] [Music]
[33:31] there burns a question.
[33:38] What was I placed
[33:45] on earth? here for.
[33:52] He truly
[33:54] wants
[33:59] to build a kingdom
[34:05] not of my own
[34:12] but of the Lord.
[34:19] And I want my life
[34:26] to count for Jesus.
[34:32] For earthly things
[34:39] will quickly
[34:41] fade.
[34:46] No need to
[34:51] [Music]
[34:53] to worldly
[34:55] riches,
[34:59] but only
[35:01] [Music]
[35:02] seek
[35:05] [Music]
[35:07] eternal
[35:09] gain.
[35:14] [Music]

[35:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Enjoy the special
[35:33] and the testimony. Amen. Want to put him
[35:35] first. Amen. I want to say this. It's
[35:38] good to say that he's a Lord, but it's
[35:41] wonderful when you can say he's my Lord.
[35:43] It's good to say he's a provider, but
[35:45] it's good to say he's my provider.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's nothing wrong with say
[35:49] that he's a provider, but we want that
[35:51] relationship to grow to each one of us
[35:54] can see here tonight and say, "He's my
[35:57] provider and he's my Lord." Amen. That's
[35:59] our heart's desire, man. Sister Sarah
[36:02] writes a testimony here. I'd like to
[36:04] thank the Lord for healing Isabelle. And
[36:07] they said she uh she had a accident
[36:10] riding a bicycle and her face hit the
[36:12] concrete. Her mouth and the gum and the
[36:14] teeth were hurt. Uh but we prayed the
[36:18] Lord stopped the bleeding and all is
[36:20] well now.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:23] Praise the Lord.
[36:26] Amen.

[36:41] mentioned last Sunday. Uh brother Andrew
[36:44] will be going this weekend to minister
[36:46] to them and we just pray that the Lord

[36:50] man uh just a teenager. We pray that the
[36:52] Lord will certainly uh touch their
[36:54] hearts. Amen. They're really going
[36:56] through a difficult time. Amen. If you
[36:58] have a need upon your heart tonight, did
[37:00] you just lift your hand up to him and
[37:02] and your need? Amen. We we we just heard
[37:05] the testimonies of what he's done and we
[37:07] believe that he's here to do the same.
[37:09] Amen. His desire is that each one of us
[37:12] will come to the knowledge of him the
[37:15] same way that we'll know who the riches
[37:17] and the greatness of what he can do in
[37:20] our lives. The brothers that are taking
[37:21] the offerings, if you could come,
[37:23] brother Serge, if you could just come
[37:24] and take the needs before the church.
[37:26] Amen.

[38:21] needs of your people are that you may
[38:24] provide them, Lord. Father God, if
[38:26] anybody needs healing, Lord, give them
[38:28] healing, Lord. If anybody needs peace,
[38:30] give them peace, Lord. Father, if
[38:33] anybody needs, Lord, the baptism of the
[38:36] Holy Ghost, Lord, give it to them, Lord.
[38:39] Father, and I pray that your children
[38:41] may be blessed tonight, Lord. And
[38:44] Father, help us, Lord, to continue in
[38:45] this journey, Lord. And father, bless
[38:48] the offerings, Lord. Bless the tithings,
[38:50] Lord. And bless the cheerful giver,
[38:53] Lord. And if anyone needs a job, Lord,
[38:55] provide it for them. If anyone needs a
[38:57] home, a house, provide it for them,
[38:59] Lord. If if anybody needs a car, provide
[39:02] it for them, Lord. Whatever material
[39:04] things we need, Lord. We know that
[39:06] you're our provider, Lord. And we thank
[39:08] you for it, Father, in Jesus Christ's
[39:10] name. Amen. Amen.
[39:20] the Lord for bringing them back. There
[39:23] is a
[39:27] in times of need.
[39:30] Oh, and that gives me hope.
[39:35] Oh, that brings me pain.
[39:40] Oh, in every trial,
[39:44] through every test.
[39:48] Oh, and my Savior stands
[39:53] in my face.
[39:56] Oh, and when the Lord
[40:02] ted,
[40:05] all your strength is lost.
[40:10] And your heart feels so
[40:14] [Music]
[40:15] th
[40:17] is greater than the soul.
[40:22] Take courage.
[40:26] Your battle is alone.
[40:30] Oh, and when the waters run,
[40:34] oh, he calls my name.
[40:38] Oh
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] my go
[40:48] [Music]
[40:56] and he makes me stand
[41:00] out on the water.
[41:04] [Music]
[41:10] Hallelujah.
[41:14] God
[41:16] [Music]
[41:18] is
[41:21] remember God
[41:24] is greater than your soul.
[41:29] Make courage.
[41:33] Let's all stand and sing it. Let's sing
[41:36] that second verse again. What a water
[41:39] cry. Just sing it as we
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:47] [Music]
[41:54] all
[41:59] I falter.
[42:02] Oh, and it makes me stay.
[42:06] I
[42:09] [Music]
[42:10] will go to your heart.
[42:14] [Music]
[42:24] Remember
[42:28] [Music]
[42:38] the battle is the
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that verse again. When the
[42:43] water rise.
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] When the waters rise,
[42:51] he's cross
[42:53] [Applause]
[42:56] and he
[42:57] [Music]
[43:04] holds my hand
[43:06] [Music]
[43:08] Yes, I should alter
[43:12] and it makes me stand
[43:16] out on the water.
[43:21] You are
[43:24] you tire
[43:28] [Music]
[43:32] and your heart is strong.
[43:40] He's gone.
[43:45] Take her.
[43:48] The battle is the Lord.
[43:52] Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Don't you take courage knowing that the
[43:56] battle is the Lord's?
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's does something good to my
[44:00] heart.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Because we're definitely in a battle.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; You know, there's some battles, some
[44:05] traps laid before you this even tonight
[44:08] &gt;&gt; to keep you from coming here
[44:10] &gt;&gt; because God wanted to meet you here. God
[44:13] has something special for you tonight.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; And God is a living God. He's not some
[44:19] historical something,
[44:21] &gt;&gt; but he knows your need.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; He knows where you're at. He knows the
[44:25] season. And he's provided a way
[44:28] &gt;&gt; for you to overcome.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm happy to be in the house of
[44:31] the Lord. How many are happy to be here
[44:34] &gt;&gt; in his presence there's fullness of joy.
[44:37] We can just shake off the heavy bands.
[44:39] Just realize one of these days and one
[44:42] of these days soon, we're going to be
[44:43] out of here. No more struggle, no more
[44:46] sorrow, no more heartache, no more devil
[44:49] trying to ruin us, trying to discourage
[44:52] us, trying to keep our head down. But oh
[44:55] my, let's lift up our heads tonight.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Let's let our hearts be encouraged.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It's not because I'm trying to work you
[45:02] up. It's a reality to the believer. It's
[45:04] a pulsation.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord?
[45:08] &gt;&gt; He certainly loves us. Amen. And if you
[45:11] have a special need, why don't we just
[45:12] go to him in prayer? And oh, I just, you
[45:16] know, I'm longing for Lord to touch our
[45:18] sister Joy that she can be back here
[45:21] playing violin. And we know that our
[45:23] sisters, you know, overcoming that blood
[45:26] pressure. And you just remember those
[45:28] that you know have a need, our brother
[45:30] John's mom and the different ones. If if
[45:33] you don't have a need that you know of,
[45:34] why don't we just lift up these these
[45:36] requests before the Lord and say, "God,
[45:39] will you touch my heart? Will you touch
[45:41] these needs?" Let's pray together.
[45:45] Precious heavenly father. Lord, it's
[45:47] it's an honor and a privilege to be able
[45:49] to stand by your grace in your presence,
[45:52] Lord, and be able to talk it over with
[45:54] you, Lord, and say how much we
[45:57] appreciate, Lord, the life you gave,
[45:59] Lord. Thank you for Calvary, Lord. Thank
[46:02] you for your goodness upon our lives,
[46:04] Lord. We, oh God, we don't see many
[46:08] times how we would deserve a love like
[46:10] this, but Lord, in our hearts, we just
[46:12] say thank you, Lord.
[46:15] Lord, and we're lifting up, oh God, your
[46:17] people, Lord, our pastor, the needs of
[46:19] your people, Lord. You see the hands
[46:21] lifted, Lord. You see the secret need,
[46:24] Lord. Let your word come, oh God, and
[46:27] give revelation, Lord. Lord, it's been
[46:30] taught by your prophet. There's nothing
[46:32] that gives more prevailing power over
[46:35] the devil than revelation. So, we're
[46:37] asking God, you'd give us revelation
[46:39] tonight as we commit your people, Lord,
[46:42] take these words and the simple thought,
[46:44] Lord, and may it be multiplied. And
[46:47] Lord, may we draw closer to you, Lord.
[46:50] And may we get closer to you, Lord, to
[46:53] do what's pleasing, Father. We're
[46:54] committing it all to you in Jesus
[46:56] Christ's name. Amen.
[46:59] Amen. Well, I have something the Lord's
[47:02] put on my heart and by the help of the
[47:04] Lord, we'll deliver our burden and we'll
[47:07] go rejoicing. Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; So, uh if you have your Bibles, we can
[47:11] go right to the word of God. Thank you
[47:13] for the songs. Wonderful testimony and
[47:16] uh uh what what a wonderful atmosphere
[47:19] that has been created. You know, God, he
[47:22] heals by music. Amen.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; God heals by his word.
[47:27] God heals by promise.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; God heals.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; God's a healer. Amen. We're thankful for
[47:33] that. So, in First Corinthians, we're
[47:35] going to read a familiar scripture. And
[47:39] maybe I'll just uh maybe tell you a
[47:41] little bit of what's on my heart, but I
[47:43] just believe that
[47:46] it's time to witness, you know, and
[47:48] that's that's the title of my thought
[47:51] this evening is time to witness. You
[47:54] know, we heard our brother testify, and
[47:57] you know, in this world, you know,
[48:01] there's there's a treasure that's in
[48:03] earthn vessels, and it's in each one of
[48:06] you. When you've contacted the Lord
[48:08] Jesus, and the spirit of truth has come
[48:11] on to you, you have a treasure that's
[48:15] hidden within your vessel. And so, we
[48:18] want to witness to the world. And I say
[48:20] it's time to witness. Amen.
[48:23] And I'm drawing inspiration from a
[48:25] message called What You Think of Christ.
[48:27] I listened to it a number of times this
[48:30] uh week. And uh it just inspired me and
[48:33] I I feel in many ways I'm
[48:37] I'm just having a revival because of
[48:39] Calvary. And uh and that's what we all
[48:42] desire for each one of you and for each
[48:44] other. And so there in 1 Corinthians
[48:46] chapter 2, we're going to read verse
[48:48] one.
[48:59] The scripture reading says this. I and I
[49:03] brethren when I came to you came not
[49:06] with excellency of speech or of wisdom
[49:10] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[49:13] Amen. You may have your seat. You know,
[49:15] I think this is a wonderful thought that
[49:18] our prophet Paul,
[49:20] you know, though he could have come with
[49:24] with the wisdom of man being raised up
[49:28] uh under Galia, he was taught all of the
[49:32] law and different things. But yet he
[49:35] said this that when I come to you, I
[49:39] come not with excellency of speech or
[49:42] wisdom,
[49:43] declaring unto you the testimony of God.
[49:46] You know, Paul gave a witness and a
[49:50] testimony of God. And you know, I I just
[49:55] feel in my heart as our pastor's been,
[49:58] you know, going down this line about the
[50:01] path forward. And part of the the path
[50:04] forward is is the commission. And, you
[50:06] know, God has given us a power and he's
[50:09] given us a new birth and the baptism of
[50:11] the Holy Ghost and it's to carry out the
[50:13] commission. And so, part of the burden
[50:17] uh that we want to come behind is what's
[50:19] on our pastor's heart. And so I just
[50:22] think about, you know, the great
[50:23] revelations of the message of the hour,
[50:25] the serpent seed, the seals, the church
[50:27] ages, seeing the horse riders come
[50:30] through and all that. You know, a lot of
[50:32] that can be so fundamental in its its
[50:35] teaching. And and we can get where when
[50:38] we're witnessing to people, it's a lot
[50:39] of knowledge to people. But I just want
[50:43] uh to focus here and just maybe um just
[50:47] say this. There's a way to witness.
[50:50] Amen. And I believe that God wants to
[50:53] reveal it more and more by this end time
[50:55] message. And so, you know, I just I'm
[50:58] saying this from a personal experience.
[51:01] And so, when I preach the word, please,
[51:03] if the shoe fits, you can wear it, too.
[51:05] But I've already put it on and I've
[51:07] already seen the way the Lord's dealing
[51:09] with me. And um a lot of times you just
[51:12] feel so short when God opens something
[51:14] up. But you know, hey, we got the grace
[51:17] of God. And if you don't have a well man
[51:19] in front of you that you're walking
[51:21] towards a perfect man, then I say call
[51:24] upon God for revelation.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; We need revelation because where we're
[51:28] at, God's calling us higher.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so don't take this personal,
[51:33] but take it that you can take it to
[51:35] heart,
[51:36] &gt;&gt; right? So, so if it starts getting
[51:38] scratchy on your flesh, well, then
[51:40] that's okay. You know what? That's the
[51:42] way that God deals with his children.
[51:44] Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; So he says, "For I have determined not
[51:49] to know anything among you save Jesus
[51:52] Christ and him crucified."
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm telling you, there's so many
[51:57] things that we could know.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; There's so much knowledge in the world.
[52:01] We can know about Facebook. We can know
[52:03] about the AI. We can know about schools
[52:06] and all of this stuff, right? But I
[52:09] believe what Paul was getting at is that
[52:12] once you receive a revelation of who
[52:14] Jesus Christ is and who he is in you,
[52:17] you make a determination like he said,
[52:20] "I am determined not to know anything
[52:23] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[52:26] crucified." You know, when we start
[52:28] knowing about certain people's problems
[52:31] or problems in the church, problems in
[52:34] in politics, all of these problems, we
[52:37] start knowing and then we start
[52:39] testifying of those things. We start
[52:41] talking about those things. And Paul's
[52:44] saying here, I believe, he says, "I'm
[52:45] determined not to know nothing. I don't
[52:49] want to know none of that."
[52:51] &gt;&gt; I want to know what Christ has for me. I
[52:53] want to know what Christ has for you.
[52:55] And I know when he died on the cross of
[52:57] Calvary, he came to loose you of sin.
[53:00] He's came to heal you. He's came to
[53:01] bring deliverance. He's came to give you
[53:03] comfort. He came to give you counsel. He
[53:06] came to give you instruction.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what our prophet Paul did
[53:10] for us.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; He started recognizing. He's saying,
[53:13] "Look, I'm determined. I'm, you know,
[53:15] I'm a witness of this."
[53:17] &gt;&gt; He can know a bunch of things about
[53:19] religion and about church order and
[53:21] about, you know, a lot of things. But
[53:23] hey, you know what? I've come in contact
[53:26] with somebody who turned my world
[53:28] around.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; I was on my high horse and I was going
[53:31] one way, but when I met him, he turned
[53:33] my whole world around.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And it's because Jesus Christ was
[53:37] crucified. He never met him in the
[53:39] flesh. It was after he went to the
[53:41] cross. He was buried and rose again.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; And then he knew him when he returned
[53:47] back to the pillar of fire. But he made
[53:50] contact. And when he had that personal
[53:53] contact, then he's given this revelation
[53:56] &gt;&gt; to the church. Oh, I love that so much.
[53:59] He said, "I was with you in weakness and
[54:02] in fear and in much trembling."
[54:07] I can identify with that right now.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Knowing that every word that I say, I'll
[54:14] have to give an account.
[54:16] You know, that's that's the same thing
[54:18] that you as just going to work, just
[54:21] going to school, the people that you
[54:23] talk to,
[54:24] &gt;&gt; God is going to he's he's given a
[54:27] record.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; We every time we do something or say
[54:31] something, it's going on a record.
[54:35] But it doesn't have to be the negative.
[54:38] If we become that yielded vessel that
[54:40] the spirit of God is moving and it's the
[54:42] spirit of truth that's guiding us. Amen.
[54:46] Oh, I'm so thankful for that.
[54:49] He says, "My speech and my preaching was
[54:52] not with enticing words of man's wisdom,
[54:54] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[54:57] of power, that your faith should not
[55:01] stand in the wisdom of men, but in the
[55:03] power of God."
[55:05] Well, don't put your faith in man.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Man, if you put your faith in man, God
[55:11] will cause that man to do something in
[55:14] your eyes that makes you stumble.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; You don't want to put people in the
[55:18] church offices or even your neighbor or
[55:21] your boss in a position that you're
[55:24] elevating them above Christ.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Christ of God in your heart. Let's exalt
[55:30] Christ.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Glorify the God in you. The one who's
[55:34] made the difference. The one who's broke
[55:36] the shackles.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to lift up my sickness.
[55:39] I'm going to lift up my God who by his
[55:42] stripes I'm healed. He laid his life
[55:44] down. No man take my life from me. I lay
[55:47] it down because he knew you were going
[55:50] to need that. He was going to be a
[55:52] comfort to you in your time of distress.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; When you were weary, he came and he
[55:58] comforted you. I I'm with you
[56:01] &gt;&gt; even in you till the very end.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[56:07] my well
[56:12] in 16 it says this for we
[56:16] for who hath the mind of the Lord that
[56:18] he may instruct him but we have the mind
[56:21] of Christ.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, this is a great comfort
[56:26] to know Paul's given the revelation. You
[56:30] have the mind of Christ. The mind of
[56:32] Christ has been revealed in all of the
[56:35] secrets of God's plan of redemption,
[56:38] restoration has all been made known. You
[56:42] know, in the three-fold mystery of God
[56:44] revealed, God was going to reveal
[56:46] himself in Christ and then Christ was
[56:49] going to restore the Eden. But he had to
[56:52] get preeminence first. So that threefold
[56:55] mystery plan of God is unfolding right
[56:58] before our eyes. You are a partaker of
[57:01] that. God is wanting so much to reveal
[57:04] himself who he is. Not just who he is in
[57:07] the past, but who he is in the present.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; You know, we could see the manifestation
[57:12] of Malachi 4. We can see the
[57:14] manifestation of Luke 17. We can see the
[57:17] cloud, the witness. But what about the
[57:19] witness for you and me?
[57:23] &gt;&gt; This is a time to witness.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; What God has done for you?
[57:28] &gt;&gt; It's so powerful.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Even if you feel like it's just this
[57:33] big, if God did it, it's huge.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; If God did a work in your life, tell
[57:41] somebody.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; That's powerful. You talk about getting
[57:45] the joy bells ringing in your life. The
[57:47] moment that you start testifying and
[57:50] telling of what God did for you, all of
[57:52] a sudden you get lighter in your feet.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; All of the sudden that you possess that
[57:57] ground twice. You're like, man, I'm
[58:00] taking it back.
[58:02] You know,
[58:04] &gt;&gt; my
[58:08] praise the Lord. Maybe in Matthew, we'll
[58:11] read in Matthew 22, and this is the uh
[58:15] scripture that brother Brandham reads
[58:16] when he preached this message. What ye
[58:19] what think ye of Christ? But in Matthew
[58:22] 22
[58:24] says this
[58:26] in verse 41 and 42.
[58:33] He says, "While the Pharisees gathered
[58:35] together,
[58:37] Jesus asked them, saying,
[58:40] what think ye of Christ, whose son is
[58:43] he?"
[58:45] They they say unto him, "The son of
[58:48] David?" You know, and and uh I was
[58:52] listening to that message and I tell
[58:54] you, it was so wonderful the different
[58:58] uh witnesses that came through in that
[59:01] message. But you know, I I desire that
[59:05] our church prosper. I desire that our
[59:08] church, every single member of this
[59:11] church, people who call this their
[59:14] church home, would be filled with the
[59:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost, and they they
[59:18] would feel the joy bells of the
[59:20] resurrection. Now,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; I I you know, I don't want anybody to
[59:25] fall short of what God's provided in
[59:27] this end time to have the hope of the
[59:29] resurrection and a soon rapture.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not going to beat around
[59:34] the bush. I'm asking for big things
[59:36] tonight.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; I desire and I it's my earnest
[59:40] expectation.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; So, if you feel like you're kind of on
[59:43] the the sidelines, get ready
[59:47] &gt;&gt; because I've been praying and I've been
[59:48] seeking the Lord. I'm I'm desiring this
[59:51] because we need you. We need you on the
[59:54] the battlefront.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; We have to come into the unity of the
[59:58] faith so we can get out of here.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; This is um
[1:00:08] preached in 1957 on March 3rd. He says,
[1:00:14] and this is maybe paragraph two. I'm not
[1:00:16] exactly sure. But he says, "While the
[1:00:17] Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus
[1:00:19] asked them, saying, "What think ye of
[1:00:21] Christ? Whose son is he?" And they said
[1:00:23] unto him, "The son of David?" He said,
[1:00:25] now in this paragraph, he says, "Today
[1:00:28] I was trying to get this afternoon
[1:00:31] about a watch." So, brother Brandon was
[1:00:33] preaching a previous service talking
[1:00:35] about a watch. And I love how just in
[1:00:38] the simplicity of just an interaction
[1:00:41] with something in his life, he's able to
[1:00:44] take spiritual types. You know, I think
[1:00:46] that if you and I will be observant, God
[1:00:48] is trying to speak to us in this kind of
[1:00:51] way in our everyday life. if we'll just
[1:00:53] be mindful because God wants to speak
[1:00:56] and he wants to reveal,
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; right, where we're at, the season of
[1:01:00] life that we're at. Not just in our
[1:01:01] homes, not just in business, not just in
[1:01:03] work, but where we're at in a church and
[1:01:05] where we're at as a world,
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; right? We don't want just the days to
[1:01:09] click on and not be a part of what God's
[1:01:12] doing. Amen. We want to be in on the
[1:01:15] inside,
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; you know, looking out, not on the
[1:01:19] outside looking in. Right? And that
[1:01:21] takes a new birth. that takes personal
[1:01:23] contact. Amen. But he was talking about
[1:01:26] that main spring, you know, and that
[1:01:29] main spring that that you know, we got
[1:01:32] some a watch maker in here, maybe two,
[1:01:34] and so they can tell you about or he
[1:01:37] could tell you about all of the parts
[1:01:39] that go into a watch,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; right? But within that watch, it will
[1:01:43] not tell time if that main spring is not
[1:01:46] working.
[1:01:47] And and we won't know where we're at in
[1:01:50] time if we're not feeding on this word.
[1:01:53] If we don't get filled with the Holy
[1:01:55] Ghost. If we don't get down on our knees
[1:01:57] and pray for our loved ones, for our our
[1:02:00] children and believe this word.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; We're not going to be able to tell time.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; We want that main spring on the inside
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; to be active, living, and moving.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. We can't make it happen,
[1:02:16] but we can ask
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; and we can tell God he promised it.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; He said, now
[1:02:26] he said that little mainspring in the
[1:02:28] watch,
[1:02:31] which makes all of the watches what it
[1:02:33] is. I I don't mean to be rude. They only
[1:02:37] meant to show a picture of the condition
[1:02:39] of the church. We're trying to show the
[1:02:42] people of this fine case that it's got
[1:02:48] the watch 14 karat.
[1:02:51] Some of them are
[1:02:54] unbreakable face.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Now he's just telling the details of a
[1:03:00] watch, you know, 14 karat unbreakable
[1:03:02] face. It's all jeweled up. It's got
[1:03:05] different parts of it. A watch, right?
[1:03:09] And so
[1:03:11] we might be able to show the people what
[1:03:14] fine face it has on it, what fine hands
[1:03:18] it has on it, and even the little jewels
[1:03:21] on the inside. But with all of the fine
[1:03:23] mechanic mechanics of the watch, it is
[1:03:27] no value to you for time except it has a
[1:03:32] main spring that makes all of those
[1:03:34] things work together to keep time.
[1:03:40] Today the church is trying to show their
[1:03:42] big fine buildings, their 14 karat cases
[1:03:46] and such of them and some of them an
[1:03:49] unbreakable face. And many times they're
[1:03:52] trying to tell of the rubies that they
[1:03:54] have, the gifts of the church. They're
[1:03:57] all right. There's nothing wrong with
[1:04:00] them things. And when I'm trying to
[1:04:03] explain or speak of the different gifts
[1:04:06] in the church and how yet everybody
[1:04:08] seems, not everybody, pardon me, but
[1:04:11] many seem to be defeated while
[1:04:14] they have these gifts.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; It isn't because the gifts no good. It's
[1:04:20] because the main springs isn't moving in
[1:04:23] the right way.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; So the gifts is not the problem.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; It's the main spring.
[1:04:31] We want to be right in our heart with
[1:04:33] God.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; If there's things that are wrong, let's
[1:04:35] make them right.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] [Music]
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I really believe that if the love of God
[1:04:43] is in your heart and your heart is right
[1:04:46] with God, the mainspring will work.
[1:04:49] But the devil is putting little snares
[1:04:51] and traps and he's very tricky and he
[1:04:54] tries to snare us
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; to make that impurity to where it
[1:04:59] doesn't work right.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; But we have the blood of Jesus.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; He says you might shake it and make it
[1:05:07] tick a little times, but the main spring
[1:05:09] keeps it ticking all the time and makes
[1:05:12] it operate perfectly. You know there's a
[1:05:16] perfection that a believer can to obtain
[1:05:18] to in his heart.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; A perfect man
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; says now many times you can say I can't
[1:05:28] do much about it. The condition
[1:05:32] condition today I I already feel like
[1:05:35] maybe most of us was feeling like that
[1:05:37] when I was reading that quote because I
[1:05:38] feel it. But I I want to encourage you
[1:05:41] with the rest of the quote. Now many
[1:05:43] times you could say I can't do very much
[1:05:46] about that the condition today but just
[1:05:51] one kind word to someone
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; an invitation
[1:05:56] a little testimony a little kind smile
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; or a greeting to a passer by might mean
[1:06:04] more than you think it does. Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; It's little
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; my take courage, saints.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; It's time to be bold with our faith.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; It's time to go in action. It's time to
[1:06:17] witness what God has done for you.
[1:06:20] There's people and I'm I'm kind of
[1:06:24] feeling like I'm running long because I
[1:06:26] wanted to get somewhere and now I'm
[1:06:27] taking a lot of time doing but I'm
[1:06:29] thankful for the Lord's presence and and
[1:06:32] I feel good. So I I did want to play
[1:06:34] about 20 minutes of a tape and then
[1:06:36] maybe make a comment. But I feel to lay
[1:06:39] this in here as we're listening to this
[1:06:41] portion of tape. It's about 22 minutes.
[1:06:44] I want you to recognize what brother
[1:06:45] Brandham is talking about this question
[1:06:48] within this question holds a decision
[1:06:51] for every single one of us and you
[1:06:53] cannot bypass it. It's something that
[1:06:57] every single human being in this
[1:06:59] building at the sound of his voice and
[1:07:02] now my voice,
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; you are going to be responsible for a
[1:07:06] decision
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; over this scripture.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; What think ye of Christ?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And it's liberating to the believer when
[1:07:14] he has the answer from God.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And and and I'm not here to scare you.
[1:07:19] I'm here to tell you this is God wanting
[1:07:21] to empower you.
[1:07:24] Because then that's when you can really
[1:07:26] know that your witness is going to be
[1:07:28] effective.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; That when you speak,
[1:07:32] that's deity speaking.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Says now
[1:07:39] your decision on what the scripture
[1:07:42] asks. The question will seal your
[1:07:45] eternal destination.
[1:07:48] It might mean the healing tonight
[1:07:50] physically. Your concept of what this
[1:07:53] question is determined whether you walk
[1:07:55] out of a chair that chair tonight sir or
[1:07:59] it may mean whether you rise out of that
[1:08:01] wheelchair. It may mean the difference
[1:08:03] between death and life to many of you
[1:08:08] and sinner friend it may mean your
[1:08:10] eternal destination what you think of
[1:08:12] it. Now in paragraph 10 it says now no
[1:08:16] matter how much I emphasize I would try
[1:08:19] to put it
[1:08:21] how much emphasis I would try to put on
[1:08:23] it still it is of no effect unless you
[1:08:27] receive it accept it for yourself
[1:08:31] not apply it for some organization or
[1:08:34] some denomination or to mommy or to pop
[1:08:37] papa but it has to be applied to you p
[1:08:42] your personal case what your thought is
[1:08:45] of Christ, what you think him to be. Do
[1:08:50] you think him to be a dead person that
[1:08:52] died 1900 years ago? Do you think him to
[1:08:56] be just like another Muhammad or Buddha
[1:08:58] or some great philosopher or teacher or
[1:09:01] some prophet or a poet? Or do you
[1:09:03] believe him to be the infallible son of
[1:09:07] the living God who raised from the dead
[1:09:10] and is here tonight to present
[1:09:13] to give you the desire of your heart.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. My
[1:09:21] in 13 it says this little age old
[1:09:24] question has been risen in the minds of
[1:09:26] the people through the centuries who
[1:09:28] Jesus was even this day among many of
[1:09:33] the Pentecostal ranks it is believed and
[1:09:36] taught
[1:09:38] that he is not virgin born son of God
[1:09:42] you know and I'll just say this you know
[1:09:46] when we listen to it just think of it
[1:09:49] and think about because I want to ask
[1:09:52] the question and and you answer it in
[1:09:55] your own time and maybe let it just kind
[1:09:57] of as you're hearing the tape but you
[1:09:59] know what is the message
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; you know people always going to ask you
[1:10:04] what is the message
[1:10:06] and then once you start telling them
[1:10:07] however you decide to tell them
[1:10:11] what does the message mean to you
[1:10:13] because I think that before we start
[1:10:15] telling them what the message is I think
[1:10:17] if You tell them what the message means
[1:10:19] to you.
[1:10:21] I think that that actually will identify
[1:10:23] with people who are in the world
[1:10:25] hurting, longing for deliverance,
[1:10:27] longing for salvation, longing for
[1:10:30] healing. Like we have to be a partaker
[1:10:32] first.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; People have already been inundated with
[1:10:35] information. We don't need to be
[1:10:37] reporters.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; We don't need to just tell people thus
[1:10:41] and thus just like court reporting or
[1:10:43] news reporting. We want the life of
[1:10:45] Christ to be excited about what God's
[1:10:48] done for us.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; What God promised me, I might not have
[1:10:52] it now,
[1:10:54] but my faith is speaking. Amen. Isn't
[1:10:57] that your desire?
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, if the brothers don't mind and
[1:11:02] uh we can play this 22 minutes. Um it
[1:11:05] begins there in paragraph 14 and we'll
[1:11:08] end on paragraph 28. But like I say,
[1:11:11] it's probably about 22 minutes. Um, and
[1:11:13] we'll listen to that and then we'll make
[1:11:15] a few comments at the end and we trust
[1:11:17] we won't be too long. So, brothers, if
[1:11:19] you can go ahead and play that now.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Now, that knocks every foundation out
[1:11:28] from under Christianity.
[1:11:32] He was either the son of God's virgin
[1:11:36] burned or his blood was no more than my
[1:11:40] blood or your blood.
[1:11:44] Sex had nothing to do with it. Almighty
[1:11:48] God overshadowed the Virgin Mary and she
[1:11:52] brought forth the son Christ Jesus by
[1:11:56] the great mine conception
[1:11:59] by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:03] to form a blood cell in the womb of a
[1:12:07] girl who knew no man.
[1:12:10] And through that holy unadulterated
[1:12:14] blood, my faith rests solemnly upon that
[1:12:18] tonight and nothing else.
[1:12:22] For my forgiveness of sin and the reason
[1:12:27] my faith is stayed there because I truly
[1:12:30] believe it was the blood of God.
[1:12:36] That's why it has a resting place.
[1:12:40] But it's so
[1:12:44] scattered today.
[1:12:47] What about it?
[1:12:50] Let's just call a few witnesses for a
[1:12:53] few minutes
[1:12:54] and find out what would be said of
[1:12:58] someone who's passed on.
[1:13:01] What if we tonight could call his arch
[1:13:04] enemy
[1:13:06] Judas Iser?
[1:13:09] The very name Judas
[1:13:13] just makes us shiver.
[1:13:17] Now the word Judas is not such a bad
[1:13:20] name.
[1:13:22] Not up to that time. Perhaps many little
[1:13:25] Jewish boys was named Judas.
[1:13:29] I don't know but perhaps come from the
[1:13:32] name of Judah
[1:13:34] the tribe.
[1:13:36] But it was what Judas did that makes
[1:13:40] people fear and shake at the name of
[1:13:43] Judas.
[1:13:48] What makes the name of Jesus so sacred?
[1:13:52] There was many little boys named Jesus.
[1:13:58] But it was what Jesus did and what he
[1:14:01] was that makes his name so reverent
[1:14:03] tonight that all the family in heaven is
[1:14:06] named after him.
[1:14:09] Not so much of what your name is, but
[1:14:12] what you are with your name.
[1:14:17] Judas, if we could go down to the
[1:14:21] regions of the lost and the damned,
[1:14:25] if we could go to that wearome
[1:14:29] place called hell
[1:14:33] and could call
[1:14:35] that deceiving spirit of Judas is
[1:14:39] character to this platform tonight,
[1:14:43] it would say, Judas,
[1:14:46] what's Thank ye of Christ.
[1:14:50] Whose son is he?
[1:14:54] I could imagine you could hear 30 pieces
[1:14:58] of silver
[1:15:00] rattled across the platform and you'd
[1:15:02] say, "I have betrayed innocent blood."
[1:15:10] What if I could go to the smuggling
[1:15:14] regions of loss
[1:15:16] and call the Roman soldiers
[1:15:20] who took the spirit pushed it into his
[1:15:24] heart?
[1:15:27] I would say what think ye of Christ
[1:15:32] who son is he?
[1:15:35] You'd say, "Truly, that is the son of
[1:15:39] God."
[1:15:43] What if I could go to Pilate,
[1:15:48] that great emperor of Rome,
[1:15:51] go down to the regions of the lost,
[1:15:57] honest, fragile man
[1:16:00] and call him here tonight
[1:16:03] before this audience. Remember, I'm
[1:16:06] calling his enemies.
[1:16:10] If I could call Pontius Pilot tonight
[1:16:15] and say, Pilate,
[1:16:18] you've been gone for 2,000 years.
[1:16:23] Wherever you have been, I want to ask
[1:16:25] you a question
[1:16:28] that you might answer this audience
[1:16:31] tonight.
[1:16:33] What's your opinion of Christ?
[1:16:36] What kind of an answer do you think he
[1:16:38] would give
[1:16:41] when Christ was placed before Pontius
[1:16:45] Pilate to make his decision of what he
[1:16:48] thought of him?
[1:16:51] And my brother, sister, Christ is placed
[1:16:55] before you tonight
[1:16:58] to give your opinion and to make your
[1:17:02] decision. What do you think of him?
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; And your action will speak much louder
[1:17:09] than your words.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Let's look at Pontius of Pilate
[1:17:16] as they dug him out one morning to sit
[1:17:18] on the dead seat.
[1:17:22] to be favorable to the Jews and to the
[1:17:25] Romans when they dug Jesus up before him
[1:17:31] with the thorns on his head as a crown
[1:17:36] and his hands tied behind him. I could
[1:17:39] imagine that great emperor as he sat on
[1:17:44] his throne
[1:17:46] all discouraged
[1:17:49] because he'd been gotten up a little
[1:17:51] early
[1:17:53] and with his hipper all up
[1:17:57] as he swing his hair back and look into
[1:18:00] the face and say they can't be much to
[1:18:03] that.
[1:18:08] You say, "What a horrible person."
[1:18:11] But oh my decrepit sinner friend, you do
[1:18:16] less than that
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; by rejecting him
[1:18:24] and say with his hands tied behind him,
[1:18:27] how could a king with his hands down?
[1:18:31] That's the king of heaven.
[1:18:33] as Pilate was judging him, looking at
[1:18:36] him up and down,
[1:18:38] that if you are the Christ, why don't
[1:18:41] you say something about it? And Jesus
[1:18:44] never opened his mouth.
[1:18:48] I can imagine Pilate saying, "Well, he's
[1:18:51] a scared
[1:18:53] because he's standing before me,
[1:18:57] the emperor
[1:18:58] of Rome.
[1:19:03] Then all of a sudden
[1:19:06] I can hear a horse come galloping at
[1:19:09] full speed
[1:19:12] coming from the palace
[1:19:15] and a young handsome soldier jumped from
[1:19:18] the saddle
[1:19:20] into the street up through by the guard
[1:19:23] and they seen he was a palace guard
[1:19:27] so they let him in. He was carrying a
[1:19:30] piece of paper in his hand and I can see
[1:19:33] him as he walked up before Pilate,
[1:19:37] bows himself to the floor
[1:19:40] and say, "Your majesty, sir,
[1:19:45] I have a letter from your wife."
[1:19:50] She said it was urgent
[1:19:53] for you to receive this at once.
[1:19:57] That's why I broke in like the way I
[1:20:00] did.
[1:20:02] I see Pilate open up the letter with his
[1:20:05] head back.
[1:20:08] And as I begin to watch his eyes under
[1:20:12] his great brow,
[1:20:16] the frown and the long eyelashes
[1:20:20] and eyebrows,
[1:20:22] his eyes goes to a cold stare.
[1:20:27] As he reads this letter,
[1:20:30] he looks around to Jesus
[1:20:33] and he looks back.
[1:20:36] His face becomes white.
[1:20:40] His lips doesn't seem to have any blood.
[1:20:46] His knees begin to knock together.
[1:20:51] What's so important about that letter
[1:20:55] from his pagan wife?
[1:20:58] Let's look over his shoulder
[1:21:01] and read and see what it says.
[1:21:08] My dear husband,
[1:21:11] don't you have anything to do with that
[1:21:15] just man? heart this day. I've suffered
[1:21:18] many things in a dream because of him.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he would say happened.
[1:21:28] What did he do
[1:21:31] instead of releasing him as he had
[1:21:34] power?
[1:21:36] Instead of embracing him in saying,
[1:21:39] "Yes, Jesus, I've been wrong. I judge
[1:21:44] you, but this morning I receive you as
[1:21:50] my savior, as the son of the living God.
[1:21:55] I bow before you.
[1:21:59] But instead of that, he tried to justify
[1:22:03] himself like many sinners of this world
[1:22:06] today.
[1:22:08] I just won't go to the meeting
[1:22:12] that bring me a pan of clean water
[1:22:17] and he washed his hands of him but I
[1:22:21] just won't accept him but I just won't
[1:22:24] have anything else to do with it. Did
[1:22:27] that clean his hands?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:22:32] And neither will it clean your hands.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; It's before you.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; You've got to make a choice.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; God compels you to make a choice.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You can't leave that door tonight
[1:22:52] without some sort of a choice.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; It's impossible.
[1:23:00] As the old legend says,
[1:23:03] Pilate many years later where in the
[1:23:06] northern countries in the mountains, he
[1:23:09] was finally dethroned
[1:23:11] and he weary and he walked and finally
[1:23:16] committed suicide
[1:23:18] by plunging himself into a great hole of
[1:23:21] water and drowned.
[1:23:24] And it said as a legend that every year
[1:23:28] just about the time
[1:23:31] that he washed his hands of the Lord
[1:23:34] Jesus
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:37] and accepted
[1:23:39] his great dignity instead of humbling
[1:23:42] himself to the Lord.
[1:23:44] The legend says that that blue water
[1:23:47] bubbles up for hours to show him that
[1:23:52] blue clean water won't wash the blood of
[1:23:56] Jesus Christ off of the hands of any
[1:23:58] person.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Neither will a name or a church boat.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Neither will anything else ever wash the
[1:24:08] blood of Jesus Christ off of a man or
[1:24:10] woman's hands who's heard the gospel.
[1:24:14] You've got to make your decision.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; There's no other way for you to do.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; You either accept him or you
[1:24:26] deny him.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; He is on your hands
[1:24:32] and there's nothing you can do.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Only make your decision.
[1:24:39] You say, "Brother Brandham,
[1:24:42] you've been talking to his enemies."
[1:24:46] Now, what about some of his friends?
[1:24:50] That's what his enemies had to say.
[1:24:54] Let's see some of his friends.
[1:24:59] Let's call the Hebrew children to the
[1:25:02] platform tonight.
[1:25:05] Oh, you beloved friends of God,
[1:25:11] what think ye of Christ?
[1:25:14] You live many hundred years before he
[1:25:17] ever was manifested in the flesh.
[1:25:21] I can hear Shadrach say, "I'll speak far
[1:25:23] of the three of us."
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] Hallelujah.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; We are not divided.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, one doctrine. We one in hope and
[1:25:42] charity.
[1:25:46] I'll speak for the rest.
[1:25:49] It was on a gloomy morning
[1:25:53] when we were cast into a big pit of fire
[1:25:59] of a furnace at seven times hotter than
[1:26:03] it ever was.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; And we wondered what was taking place.
[1:26:12] We never felt any fire on us.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Neither did we feel or hear
[1:26:18] any hair tingion,
[1:26:21] but it seemed to be very comfortable
[1:26:24] down there.
[1:26:27] And when we turned to look,
[1:26:31] there stood one that looked like to me,
[1:26:34] the son of God.
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:39] That's what we think of him.
[1:26:44] Ezekiel,
[1:26:46] the prophet that we spoke of today.
[1:26:50] What think ye of Christ? Ezekiel,
[1:26:54] whose son is he?
[1:26:58] One day Ezekiel
[1:27:00] while the spirit of God was upon me, I
[1:27:04] looked up into the heavens.
[1:27:07] I saw him coming and the clouds were
[1:27:10] like dust under his feet.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; I saw a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:27:19] turning way up in the middle of the
[1:27:23] earth.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Daniel, will you testify tonight?
[1:27:30] Most surely will I testify.
[1:27:36] I stood one day while the spirit was
[1:27:41] upon me
[1:27:43] and I saw the gentile world all
[1:27:47] together.
[1:27:49] And I beheld until there was a stone cut
[1:27:53] out of a mountain without hand
[1:27:57] rolled into the image and smashed it. I
[1:28:01] saw all nations come to the ancient of
[1:28:04] days whose hair was as white as a snow.
[1:28:10] That's what I think of him.
[1:28:14] What a marvel.
[1:28:17] Just asked his mama.
[1:28:20] If anybody ought to know whose son it
[1:28:22] was, his mama ought to know.
[1:28:27] Mary, will you testify?
[1:28:30] Most surely will I testify.
[1:28:34] Mary, you are his mother.
[1:28:38] He laid the first nine months under your
[1:28:41] heart.
[1:28:43] What think of Christ? Mary,
[1:28:46] who son is he?
[1:28:50] She said, "I knew not a man."
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; But one day on the road down, the great
[1:28:59] angel Gable stood before me and said,
[1:29:03] "You're going to bear a child, and that
[1:29:06] holy thing will be called the son of the
[1:29:09] living God."
[1:29:11] [Applause]
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:29:21] I think the final
[1:29:25] notice
[1:29:27] the final word
[1:29:30] that ought to stand it before all
[1:29:32] nations both heaven and earth.
[1:29:37] Let's ask God about it.
[1:29:41] See what he says about it.
[1:29:45] One day up on the mount transfiguration
[1:29:50] there come a great cloud from heaven
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and overshadowed them
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; and Jesus was set out to one side and
[1:30:01] his raignment did shine as a sun
[1:30:05] God. What about this man that the Jews
[1:30:08] turned down? What about this that the
[1:30:12] Gentiles love pleasure more than they
[1:30:14] love? Who is this? Listen to God's own
[1:30:18] word. This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:30:24] am well pleased. Dare ye him?
[1:30:30] That should settle it once forever.
[1:30:34] Every man or woman that's ever mounted
[1:30:37] to anything has believed that.
[1:30:40] Let's call a poet on a scene.
[1:30:44] Eddie Puit,
[1:30:46] he his writing was rejected
[1:30:50] and he was a man cast out,
[1:30:54] but he loved the Lord
[1:30:56] and he did not go to the arm of flesh,
[1:31:00] but he went to the God who answers
[1:31:03] prayer
[1:31:04] and sitting in his office one day
[1:31:09] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
[1:31:13] Eddie picked picked up the pen and wrote
[1:31:16] the inauguration song.
[1:31:19] All hail the power of Jesus name. Let
[1:31:23] every angel's prostrate fall. Bring
[1:31:27] forth the royal diadem and crown him
[1:31:31] lord of all.
[1:31:35] blind Fanny Crosby
[1:31:38] who was tortured through her life
[1:31:42] by scornful hands and making fun of her
[1:31:46] because she wouldn't write whirly songs.
[1:31:50] What saint Banny Crosby that's called
[1:31:54] you here? And what do you think of him?
[1:31:58] Whose son is he? What does he mean to
[1:32:01] you Fanny Crosby? And when she picked up
[1:32:05] the pen, she wrote, "Past me not, oh
[1:32:10] gentle savior,
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; there my humble cry, while on others
[1:32:16] thou art calling, do not pass me by.
[1:32:22] Thou the stream of all my comfort, more
[1:32:26] than life to thee. Whom have I on earth
[1:32:31] beside thee? Or whom in heaven but me?
[1:32:37] Another note living, he loved me. Dying,
[1:32:42] he saved me. Buried, he carried my sins
[1:32:46] far away. Rising, he justifies freely
[1:32:51] forever.
[1:32:52] Someday he's coming. Oh,
[1:32:56] glorious day.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; And whose son is he?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; What's your opinion of him? What do you
[1:33:08] think about him?
[1:33:11] William Brandon, what's your opinion? Oh
[1:33:13] my
[1:33:20] You know, I think at the end of that,
[1:33:22] um, he said, "What manner of people
[1:33:24] ought we to be?" And I think it's one of
[1:33:27] those things, like I said, it's time to
[1:33:29] witness. You know, we all have an
[1:33:31] experience with the Lord. And I got to
[1:33:33] thinking, you know, I was fellowshipping
[1:33:35] with my family and I just started
[1:33:36] telling them, you know, I was asking the
[1:33:38] question because you want it to be
[1:33:40] personal, right? You know, without what
[1:33:43] God's done for you and what you've
[1:33:44] received from God, the love of God is
[1:33:47] actually the difference maker. It's the
[1:33:49] unseen force that will change someone
[1:33:51] else's life. And so without love, the
[1:33:55] love of God in our heart, our faith will
[1:33:58] be unaffectual, right? We want to
[1:34:00] contact. And so I got to thinking and as
[1:34:03] I was asking him, I was like, you know
[1:34:04] what? What does the message mean to you?
[1:34:07] You know, what is the message? And I got
[1:34:09] to thinking, I was talking with brother
[1:34:11] David about something and all of a
[1:34:13] sudden it was like one of these
[1:34:15] reminders of what the message, you know,
[1:34:18] I I I came through a denominational or
[1:34:21] they were non-denominational, but for
[1:34:23] years I was under uh teaching from a
[1:34:25] pastor and I didn't know about the
[1:34:27] message, but you know, I gave my heart
[1:34:30] to the Lord and the burden of sin left,
[1:34:32] but there was things in my life that I
[1:34:34] just couldn't get victory over. I just
[1:34:36] didn't realize that there was more. I
[1:34:38] didn't realize there was a a way to
[1:34:40] break the chains because it wasn't
[1:34:42] taught to me, right? Oh, you you were
[1:34:44] going to be like that in those
[1:34:46] conditions and that's why he died. Not
[1:34:48] knowing that there's a a promised land,
[1:34:50] a land of inheritance to walk into. And
[1:34:53] when I started coming to the message, it
[1:34:56] taught me who Christ is, the revealed
[1:34:59] word of the hour. You know, brother
[1:35:02] Brandham is not my savior. Jesus Christ,
[1:35:05] the virginborn
[1:35:07] lamb of God. He He He was our redeemer.
[1:35:11] And I got to thinking about what the
[1:35:13] message means to me.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; And I'll witness to you a little bit
[1:35:17] tonight.
[1:35:18] Is that okay?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And maybe you can identify with my
[1:35:23] testimony. And I won't be much longer,
[1:35:25] maybe about five or 10 minutes.
[1:35:28] But I just want to tell you, you know,
[1:35:31] maybe one of my oldest friends in here,
[1:35:34] Brother Tommy, he's known me since 2001
[1:35:36] or maybe 2000, somewhere around that
[1:35:38] time. But by the time I met him, I
[1:35:41] already gave my heart to the Lord. But
[1:35:43] see, I was under that denominational
[1:35:45] teaching, which there was
[1:35:46] non-denominational, but but so we were
[1:35:48] doing things that you would just think
[1:35:50] that a next worldly person would be
[1:35:53] doing. But whenever I came into the
[1:35:56] message, you know, I I was in debt. I
[1:36:00] was broken physically. I was in bondage
[1:36:03] emotionally, relationally. There was
[1:36:06] things in my life I could not fix. And
[1:36:09] the moment that I started praying with
[1:36:11] sincerity, once I came in contact with
[1:36:13] brother David and he gave me the message
[1:36:15] on CD, I started feeding on the message.
[1:36:18] And I want to tell you what what this
[1:36:21] message has done for me. It's brought
[1:36:23] restoration.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I was a complete insane person when I
[1:36:28] remember there was a time when I was 11
[1:36:30] years old. I I I didn't know how to deal
[1:36:32] with frustrations in life. I didn't grow
[1:36:34] up in church. And so disappointments,
[1:36:37] regrets, certain frustr I just didn't
[1:36:40] know how to deal with the pressures and
[1:36:42] the challenges, right? So when when
[1:36:44] someone would come against me, the best
[1:36:46] way I knew is it's time to show some
[1:36:48] fist, you know? And sometimes uh you
[1:36:52] know you you're outnumbered or
[1:36:54] outgunned. And there was a couple of
[1:36:55] times if it just wasn't the grace of God
[1:36:58] and the call of God on my life and it
[1:37:00] was more than one instance I would have
[1:37:03] been a murderer.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; You know just like you you think about
[1:37:06] the testimony of brother Brandon when he
[1:37:08] got in that fit of rage and he went to
[1:37:10] pull that trigger on those boys that
[1:37:12] beat him.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You know it was the grace of God. this
[1:37:16] message, what Christ has done for me has
[1:37:19] restored me to the mind of Christ.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; You know, I can tell somebody,
[1:37:26] you know, I'm not what I want to be.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not what I used to be,
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; you know,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; but there's there's been a change made.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; There's been a transformation because
[1:37:39] I've met him.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] And the difference is Christ.
[1:37:46] It's the power of the blood.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; You know, I was in a bunch of nonsense.
[1:37:52] And the Lord, I I'm praying in the
[1:37:55] depths of my heart, Lord, I want to do
[1:37:56] things the right way. I want to live
[1:37:58] right. I want to know you. I'm praying,
[1:38:00] God, I want to walk in your way. If
[1:38:02] you'll show me the right way, I'll walk
[1:38:04] in it.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Then I get my wife comes, my beautiful
[1:38:07] wife. I have children. I was a wreck. I
[1:38:10] was a mess. But that's what Christ does
[1:38:13] for a person. You know, I was I was
[1:38:16] going through it with finances. God
[1:38:18] completely dealt with it. Within three
[1:38:20] years, all my debts were settled because
[1:38:23] I wanted to do the right thing because I
[1:38:25] was feeding on the word of God because I
[1:38:27] was under the tutorship of a pastor and
[1:38:30] feeding personally on the message,
[1:38:32] praying and believing,
[1:38:34] you know, God healed me of menitis. I
[1:38:36] told him, I said, you know, if if you'll
[1:38:39] heal me, I'll serve you. You know, you
[1:38:41] got to have a reason.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; You know, like I want to be pleasing to
[1:38:45] you, Lord.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just go live my own life
[1:38:48] and do my own thing like a maverick. I'm
[1:38:50] I'm to be here and be a part of a work
[1:38:52] of God with each one of you. That's the
[1:38:55] same for you, for each one of us.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged. Be encouraged.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; You know, it's our God that's wanting to
[1:39:04] do so much more for us. But I, you know,
[1:39:06] I got to thinking about how, you know,
[1:39:09] uh, just the insanity that's in the
[1:39:12] world. And if we'll just witness what
[1:39:16] God has done for us.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I believe that lives can be transformed.
[1:39:20] You've seen the hand of God in your
[1:39:22] life. You've seen it in others. And I'm
[1:39:24] not saying you don't do it, but I want
[1:39:25] to see more of it.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Because really, I believe that what
[1:39:29] we're desiring and what we're longing
[1:39:31] for is going to happen as we witness.
[1:39:35] Amen. Because I believe we'll draw
[1:39:37] strength as we testify as we accept
[1:39:40] Christ and as we receive revelation
[1:39:43] every day is producing the very life of
[1:39:46] the bridegroom in the bride. Amen. Why
[1:39:50] don't we all stand as we prepare to turn
[1:39:52] this over to our pastor? And I just
[1:39:55] wanted to read this because it was
[1:39:57] something and uh you know I was
[1:40:00] fellowshipping with a brother and um a
[1:40:04] man made a comment and he's in the world
[1:40:05] with like like denominational world and
[1:40:08] he had mentioned one of the things that
[1:40:10] you know is going on in the churches is
[1:40:13] you know like with all of the things the
[1:40:16] politics that are going not outside but
[1:40:19] you could see it outside also but in the
[1:40:21] church and there's such a parallel know
[1:40:23] what's happening in the world, what's
[1:40:25] happening in the church, right? But the
[1:40:28] things that people are doing in the the
[1:40:30] adult minds like people who should be
[1:40:33] able to be mature and to have a
[1:40:36] testimony and things like that because
[1:40:38] of the things that they're doing, it's
[1:40:40] causing the children to be neglected.
[1:40:42] It's causing the young people to go out
[1:40:45] into the world and seek out uh knowledge
[1:40:48] of the world. And so when I was thinking
[1:40:51] about that, I realized that even our our
[1:40:53] prophet taught us in third Exodus, you
[1:40:56] know, the the devil is such a shrewd
[1:40:58] bird and he would attack. He he what and
[1:41:02] I'll just read the quote, but brother
[1:41:04] Brown says this in third Exodus. He says
[1:41:06] in paragraph 213, he says, "Notice the
[1:41:08] king, that new king that raised up. They
[1:41:12] didn't know Joseph."
[1:41:15] What was his first scheme? to destroy
[1:41:18] the power of Israel was with their
[1:41:21] children.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. They tried to destroy
[1:41:25] their children. Now listen close. The
[1:41:27] same devil in a different form of
[1:41:30] kingship tried to destroy God's only son
[1:41:33] to get rid of the children first before
[1:41:36] they ever get started. The devil is a
[1:41:39] real shrewd bird. He knows how to hit
[1:41:42] the thing before it gets started. He
[1:41:45] knows it. See,
[1:41:48] and the only thing you can do that you
[1:41:51] can ever do to beat him is to rely on
[1:41:55] Christ, humble yourself, and let him
[1:41:57] lead you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; See, you'll never do it any other way.
[1:42:02] Your intellectual powers will never do
[1:42:04] it. You've got to believe it and rely on
[1:42:08] him.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd. He ain't the sheep.
[1:42:11] It ain't the sheep's business to keep
[1:42:13] the wolves away. It's the shepherd's
[1:42:16] business, but the the sheep must stay
[1:42:19] with the shepherd in order to stay safe.
[1:42:22] And that's my safety zone is Christ in
[1:42:26] Christ. The word is Christ. That's the
[1:42:29] safety zone.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I want to say to you
[1:42:32] tonight, you know, let's it's time to
[1:42:35] witness. It's time to lay aside every
[1:42:37] other weight. And it's time to have the
[1:42:39] vision that, you know, the devil's
[1:42:41] trying to attack our children. The
[1:42:44] devil's trying to disrupt them before
[1:42:46] they ever get a start. But let's let's
[1:42:48] let's dedicate ourselves to praying for
[1:42:51] our young people. Let's dedicate
[1:42:53] ourselves to to lay everything little
[1:42:56] things that that maybe uh uh just, you
[1:42:58] know, in our hearts maybe try to hinder
[1:43:00] our prayer.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to God. Let's say, God,
[1:43:04] will you just, oh God, do in me a work
[1:43:08] that I can just I want to be effectual.
[1:43:10] I want to witness. Amen.
[1:43:13] Why don't we bow our hearts together?
[1:43:21] If Lord's put something on your heart
[1:43:23] and you just want to lift your hands and
[1:43:25] say, "Lord, I I've heard you speak to me
[1:43:29] tonight." And Lord, I want to witness to
[1:43:32] you and what you've done for me. And I
[1:43:34] want to tell others what I think of
[1:43:36] Christ and how he's changed me and how
[1:43:39] he's tried to will God bring the
[1:43:42] inheritance, the the transformation into
[1:43:45] the promised land to being raptured into
[1:43:47] Christ. If you feel that God's moved on
[1:43:50] your heart in this way and you just want
[1:43:52] to lift your hand or lift your heart
[1:43:54] with every head bowed and you just want
[1:43:58] God to take that burden in your heart
[1:44:02] and make the difference and make the
[1:44:04] change, I believe you'll do it. Let us
[1:44:07] pray.
[1:44:10] Merciful God, Lord, we thank you God for
[1:44:13] Calvary. We thank you for the blood that
[1:44:16] divine blood that Lord, it's a blood
[1:44:20] that will never lose its power. And
[1:44:24] Lord, it's here tonight, Lord, to to
[1:44:26] cleanse the vilest sinner. Lord, it's
[1:44:28] here to Lord take us out of the
[1:44:31] conditions, Lord, to make us new and to
[1:44:34] give us, oh God, another start, Lord, to
[1:44:37] oh God, lay things that maybe try to
[1:44:40] hinder this witness that your spirit
[1:44:44] wants to declare out of us, Lord. And we
[1:44:48] just want, oh God, you to move on these
[1:44:51] hearts and those that have raised their
[1:44:53] hand that desired, Lord, your word said
[1:44:55] that you draw nigh unto me and I'll draw
[1:44:57] nigh unto you. Father, I pray you touch
[1:44:59] each one and may when they leave here,
[1:45:02] Lord, they can know you in a better way.
[1:45:05] And by the words of your prophet, Lord,
[1:45:07] may it anchor deep, Lord, as we commit
[1:45:10] them all to you. We thank you in Jesus
[1:45:12] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:45:18] Praise the Lord. Maybe uh you know, I
[1:45:21] just think that the Lord's so wonderful.
[1:45:24] You know, as you go and uh you think
[1:45:28] about this week, just be sensitive. I
[1:45:30] know the Lord will make a way for you to
[1:45:32] testify to somebody and witness what God
[1:45:34] has done for you, what your faith speaks
[1:45:37] out. Amen. What are we going to sing
[1:45:39] here? Sounds good.
[1:45:44] [Music]

[1:46:57] I can face
[1:46:59] you
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:05] because
[1:47:07] he
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because he lives
[1:47:11] [Music]
[1:47:14] here.
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:23] I know.
[1:47:26] Yes, I know.
[1:47:31] I hear
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:38] his word.
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:46] Let's sing that chorus again. Just think
[1:47:49] of it. He's alive and here Tonight
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:00] I can praise
[1:48:03] you Oh,
[1:48:08] be
[1:48:13] [Music]
[1:48:24] [Music]
[1:48:30] I know
[1:48:32] Behold
[1:48:34] my future.
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:44] The living.
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:51] Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not only does he live, but he's
[1:48:56] coming back. That's right. You know, I I
[1:48:58] thought as brother Andrew was talking
[1:49:02] and and what brother Brandham said and
[1:49:06] he talked about testifying. You know,
[1:49:08] the scripture says that you should
[1:49:09] testify to yourself.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; It does.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; You need to You need to tell yourself
[1:49:17] what God's done for you and what he done
[1:49:20] to you.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; You need to tell yourself that you're
[1:49:22] not what you used to be. Amen.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Satan's whole thing is negativity.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; That's his whole thing.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; It's his kingdom.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; It's his world.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; He thinks he's in control.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; But you you know what you need to tell
[1:49:38] him, Satan? This is your world.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; But I'm not of this world.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not of this place.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And that's what the Lord came for.
[1:49:51] He said, "I'll not leave you powerless,
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; but I personal pronoun will come again."
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; That where I am, you may be also.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; He gave us power to overcome.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Not just power to heal and cast out
[1:50:07] devils.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; But first power we have is to overcome
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; the sin that so easily besets us. the
[1:50:15] doubts that he's always put in our
[1:50:18] minds, the complexes that he's trying to
[1:50:21] give us, the fear. That's all he is is
[1:50:24] is fear. He's a liar.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; He's not going to say one good thing
[1:50:29] about you.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; He's got he's got the biggest book of
[1:50:34] remembrance there ever is. He remembers
[1:50:38] everything you've ever done.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; And he's the accuser of the brethren.
[1:50:42] But I'm glad there's a sea of God's
[1:50:45] forgetfulness.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that he chose the place to meet
[1:50:49] every believer is under the shed blood.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; I'm glad that the blood of God cleanses
[1:50:55] us from all unrighteousness.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad because of that blood, he
[1:51:00] can put his spirit in us to help us
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; overcome the devil. Remember, he that is
[1:51:09] in you is greater
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; And remember, where does he battle you
[1:51:16] at? Right here.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; He gets you thinking. He gets you
[1:51:21] looking. He gets talking to you. He'll
[1:51:23] have you look at everything in the world
[1:51:26] but at him.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; I know there's a song that that in the
[1:51:30] light he said of him, everything else
[1:51:34] grows dim. I mean, we we can't forget
[1:51:37] that
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; we're his and we just didn't choose him.
[1:51:42] Do you know he chose us?
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "You didn't choose me. I chose
[1:51:47] you. I picked you.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And not only did I pick you, but I
[1:51:51] purchased you.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; And and I'll not leave you. I'll be with
[1:51:55] you and I'll be all the way." That's is
[1:52:00] wonderful. And I think that what
[1:52:02] sometimes we just get given the devil
[1:52:05] too much credit.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; We just let him become too big
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; in our lives,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; too much fear.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; And he's a bluff.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet said he's a big
[1:52:19] alley oop. He's just a big big old
[1:52:23] gigantic
[1:52:25] bluff
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; and you're his and he knew you. I
[1:52:32] thought when brother Andrew was
[1:52:33] testifying what he was when I first met
[1:52:35] Andrew he had he had just broke his back
[1:52:39] and he couldn't pick up a pencil
[1:52:44] but somebody loved him first.
[1:52:48] He loves him because he loved him first.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; And don't ever forget that. If you're
[1:52:56] struggling or you're going through a
[1:52:58] challenge or life gets too heavy,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; just stop a moment.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Shut out the world.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; And think about him.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Think about who he is.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is, Noah?
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Who do you say he is, Moses? Who do you
[1:53:17] say is Brian Fanny Crosby? Who do you
[1:53:20] say he is? Just ask yourself, who do you
[1:53:23] say he is?
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; And I think when you come to the
[1:53:27] conclusion, he's king of kings,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; lord of lords.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; He's all in all.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; And he wants to give me
[1:53:38] the same spirit
[1:53:40] that raised him from the dead.
[1:53:43] God wants to give every single person in
[1:53:47] here the same spirit that quickened him.
[1:53:53] The same spirit that he overcame by.
[1:53:57] He'll give you that spirit that you too
[1:54:01] can overcome.
[1:54:04] All you have to do somewhere sometime
[1:54:06] just say, "Lord, I need that spirit.
[1:54:11] I need that life that was in you in me.
[1:54:16] I need that spirit that was in you was a
[1:54:20] holy spirit.
[1:54:22] It was the spirit of the father.
[1:54:25] It was the spirit of God.
[1:54:29] Was God above us? God with us. Now God
[1:54:33] in us.
[1:54:35] And we can take that spirit,
[1:54:39] if we'll have faith,
[1:54:41] that spirit will bear witness with our
[1:54:44] spirit and we can overcome
[1:54:48] any obstacle, any sickness. I was told
[1:54:52] that a lady stopped by the church. I
[1:54:55] don't know if she's here or not, but she
[1:54:57] said she asked us to pray because there
[1:55:01] there was a a a woman and three children
[1:55:04] missing.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know the circumstance, but I
[1:55:08] know one who does.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; And he's given us authority
[1:55:15] by his son
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; to approach the throne of grace boldly
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; and make our petitions known.
[1:55:25] You have that right tonight by the blood
[1:55:27] of Jesus Christ. You say, "But brother
[1:55:29] McGary, I've sinned. I've done some
[1:55:31] terrible things." You still have the
[1:55:34] right to to approach that throne,
[1:55:37] confess your sins, and he'll be faithful
[1:55:40] and just to forgive them
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; and throw him in the sea of God
[1:55:45] forgetfulness. And you know, God throws
[1:55:48] him in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:55:51] Satan puts him in his book of his
[1:55:54] remembrance and he'll take the charge
[1:55:57] and the punishment for everything in
[1:56:00] that book.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So tonight, as brother Andrew
[1:56:06] always asks us to pray, let's remember
[1:56:09] this
[1:56:10] circumstance.
[1:56:12] And if you have a personal circumstance,
[1:56:14] I know of some family circumstances that
[1:56:17] I believe that God can uh uh uh really
[1:56:20] do some outstanding things in. God's got
[1:56:24] a way to make things right.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You think the walls of Jericho are
[1:56:30] too thick and too big. They had chariot
[1:56:32] races.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Just a little prayer
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; and the wall come tumbling down.
[1:56:39] The Red Sea looked like it was inc
[1:56:42] uncrossable, but one little prayer and
[1:56:45] the sea open.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Make your petitions known. Have faith.
[1:56:51] So, we're I'm going to pray for this
[1:56:53] lady. You pray for one another. You make
[1:56:57] your petition known. And we just trust
[1:57:01] the Lord. I I I got a phone call this
[1:57:04] week and a man on the other vent, he
[1:57:07] said he he said, "Hello." And uh he
[1:57:10] talked to Lesie and he said, "I I heard
[1:57:13] a I heard a story about you being in a
[1:57:17] in a clothes hamper and popping your
[1:57:20] head up."
[1:57:22] That's in my testimony. He said, "It
[1:57:24] rang true with me. I'd like to stop by
[1:57:27] your church." I said, 'Brother, I said,
[1:57:31] "If you're hungering and thirsting after
[1:57:32] the Lord, the Lord will
[1:57:36] satisfy you." I said, 'You wanted to get
[1:57:38] closer to God, read your Bible and pray.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; He's the answer.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let let's just approach him
[1:57:50] one more time.
[1:57:52] And and I think brother Andrew implored
[1:57:55] us. I know I need more leadership and
[1:57:59] more of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:02] I know we need to to encourage our young
[1:58:06] people to get the power that'll help
[1:58:09] them
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; overcome.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; We got to let them know we understand
[1:58:14] they can't do it on their own. We
[1:58:16] understand
[1:58:18] that Satan is greater and and and
[1:58:21] shrewder and and more deceptive than we
[1:58:24] can ever matter. But he did not forsake
[1:58:27] us.
[1:58:31] I don't care what it is. All things are
[1:58:34] possible. Only believe. Our gracious
[1:58:38] heavenly father,
[1:58:41] a lady stopped, maybe a stranger
[1:58:45] [Music]
[1:58:47] in desperation. Father, come into our
[1:58:50] building
[1:58:53] and her heart
[1:58:56] is burdened for a mother and three
[1:58:59] children who are missing.
[1:59:06] Father, I don't need to know the
[1:59:09] circumstance,
[1:59:11] but I do know that she asked us, your
[1:59:14] children,
[1:59:16] to approach the throne of grace on her
[1:59:19] behalf.
[1:59:21] And Father, I ask that you'd protect
[1:59:23] that mother and those children, Father,
[1:59:25] and wherever she needs to be reunited,
[1:59:31] that you'd send your grace and mercy
[1:59:33] upon that circumstance
[1:59:38] and that she would
[1:59:42] recognize
[1:59:45] that it was your hand
[1:59:48] and your grace and your mercy. mercy
[1:59:52] and she would give you the praise that
[1:59:54] you so worthily
[1:59:56] deserve.
[1:59:58] And father, us in this building who are
[2:00:00] facing challenges
[2:00:03] and a spirit that is always running us
[2:00:06] down and always degrading us and always
[2:00:11] feeding us negativity and doubt.
[2:00:16] Father, we stand and say that we know
[2:00:19] who you are.
[2:00:21] The creator of heaven and earth.
[2:00:26] The one whom all power
[2:00:30] is in your hands.
[2:00:33] The one that promised that we could ask
[2:00:35] what we will of the father in your name
[2:00:40] and you would grant it.
[2:00:43] Heavenly Father, we turn our hearts this
[2:00:45] evening to that promise.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Father, laying it right before you. Even
[2:00:52] the worst parts of our nature,
[2:00:56] our failures and our doubts and our
[2:00:59] fears,
[2:01:01] we bring them boldly to the throne of
[2:01:03] grace,
[2:01:05] knowing that you'll accept us just the
[2:01:08] way that we are. And we ask you, Father,
[2:01:11] for the power that
[2:01:14] allows us to overcome.
[2:01:18] And we commit it to your altar. And we
[2:01:21] leave it there.
[2:01:24] And we don't walk out with fear,
[2:01:27] but we stand in faith
[2:01:30] knowing that you said that you would
[2:01:32] hear our petitions
[2:01:34] because we come to you in the name of
[2:01:36] the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, bless our
[2:01:40] upcoming services.
[2:01:42] Father, our October
[2:01:45] family day. Heavenly Father, may that be
[2:01:49] just such a wonderful day. And Father,
[2:01:52] our young people,
[2:01:56] Lord, in a world that
[2:02:01] we don't even know where it's going,
[2:02:04] but we're so glad we have a guide.
[2:02:09] Reach your tender finger down
[2:02:14] and lift their spirits and lift their
[2:02:16] hearts
[2:02:18] and whisper to them
[2:02:21] that you love them
[2:02:24] and show your love.
[2:02:28] Father, and kindle us a flame for more
