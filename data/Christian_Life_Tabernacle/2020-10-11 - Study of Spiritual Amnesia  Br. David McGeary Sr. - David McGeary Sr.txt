same yesterday today and forevermore and it's in jesus name we pray amen amen [Music] amen we're good to be gathered in the house of god this morning i want to welcome everyone and all our visitors are certainly happy to have you invited by the mic for our songwriting this morning god bless you amen i want to still get used to that walk you know i believe that the word of god is so perfect you know every single word has been ordered of the lord to be placed in just the the right place you know if we think about how in the beginning by the adjustment of just one word if man fell then so by the careful consideration of each word is the new man constructed into the kingdom of the lord so it's so important we talked about last week how just we should not be careful not to just casually read the scriptures like a like a history book because when you do that you can you can often breeze over the intent of what the lord has in mind you know an example of that scripture of a scripture like that where you know this could be the case if i would read the scripture for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart you know when you read that buried in that is a word which i think probably most of us just breeze right over we don't even really hardly even give it any consideration if i were to read it like this for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may shoot at the upright in heart it sounds like it's the same thing we might even say amen to that right seems just as truthful the first time i read it it agrees with our revelation i mean certainly we recognize that the wicked are increasingly being arrayed against those that are upright in heart we know we have a prophecy of that that one day all the very world will be turned against those that are the believers and what they stand for but you see one word has been removed every specific word has been placed in the scripture for a purpose no matter how unnecessary or small and in skipping over we can miss the intent the thought that god has for the verse didn't seem like anything was different the scripture that i'm talking about is psalm 11 verse 2 and that word is privily you know the thing about priviley is it seems like it's an unnecessary word and for most of us it's not even a word that we probably use in our day-to-day language right i bet some of us don't even really know what it means you know that word priviley means secretly something that's done hidden in darkness and that inclusion of that one word makes the difference between recognizing that the attack of the enemy is one that's a secret attack one that can be done in darkness but just removing that one word one can miss the potential attack of the enemy against those that are upright in heart the moving of just one word that's what happened to eve right was that so careful you know it says in ephesians 6 12 it says we wrestle not against flesh and blood we wrestle against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness that hidden things the the hidden in darkness the things that are you know secret attacks we know that he's the ruler of that kingdom in ephesians 5 8 we were once of that kingdom it says that for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the world walk as children of the light and verse 13 there says something really interesting it says but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light you see that's the weapon against darkness that's the weapon against secret attacks that's the weapon against things that are hidden in darkness shine a little bit of light on it and those things can't sneak up on you or come at you in the darkness as david said in psalm 119 105 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path every word is that light that protects us against the secret attack of the enemy you know just as we heard brother branham say in our tape wednesday night anytime a question is raised we have but one response thus saith the lord right so as we read psalm 11 today let's remember the importance of surrounding ourselves with the word with that light and being careful to attend to each word that we might stand against the secret attack of the enemy let's read that together psalm 11 in the lord but i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your mouth for lo the wicked bend their boat they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do the lord is in his holy temple the lord's throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth upon the wicked he shall reign snares fire and brimstone and in horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright [Music] one ring from the fountain when i heard my savior calling me and he said come to me relaxing and of your sin repenting and i will lead you out where you [Music] hold his arms [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] my lovely [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh oh and someday i'll [Music] again [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh oh is [Music] and [Music] oh i am [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] forever foreign [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] is [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause]

[Music] amen take this rule then give me the next one amen amen we don't have no nothing to do with this one it could destroy it as far as i'm concerned amen it's going to be renovated so we could come back amen amen now we appreciate that amen but mark david has a special if he could come at this time amen hello all right oh you know uh sometimes i drive on the road especially coming to church and there's a there's a sign up there that says 2 000 plus have died on texas road this year sometimes you look at it and you say oh i didn't see none of that and and it's weird because if not for god's protection over our lives and sometimes we might just we tend to kind of like overlook it you know we wake up every morning get up running and um we just overlook god's blessing and so most of the time when i ask god oh i need this so bad and then sometimes it would just tell me i might just be driving on the road and you just tell me they just come to my mind and say what about if you don't get home and what about if you don't get home and see your kids and i would just i would i would be driving like 20 miles per hour say oh lord please i have mercy i've mur have mercy on me it is not about my faith it is not my righteousness it's just god's blessing and so this morning i want to count my blessings and name them one by one when upon life's below you are tam testosterone when you are discouraged thinking all is lost count your many blessings name them one by one and it will surprise you what the lord has done count your blessings name then one by one your blessing see what

father we want to receive a view truth and and life father we're not just here this morning for the emotional and the joy of praising and singing father but we also want to hear from you and be reminded of the battle that we're in we ask you to bless us this morning and trust that you'll be our portion we commit this service into your hands in the precious name of the lord jesus amen amen god bless you this morning he may be seated for just a moment and and uh i we're gonna listen and first of all i'd like to greet all the uh any visitors that are here that i don't know we certainly like to welcome and greet you this morning and then the many other family that's listening by way of the streaming we certainly welcome you i sent a note to a brother said i haven't seen you in a very very very long time he says well we're doing good um you know he's a front-line worker i guess that's what we call them now as front-line workers but we're all front-line workers in here but we're working for the kingdom but we should all be on the front line so we certainly like to greet all of them and and trust that this morning's personal uh there's been quite a bit of changes that goes on and you you try to sort your way through those and and try to serve what uh the best way that we can but i certainly uh trust that uh um you know you're all making it and you're all hanging in there strong so this morning we want to take a few moments and listen to a little portion of the message called spiritual amnesia now the way that this came on my heart and just struck me was we basically in this world that we're living in you guys can go and you can i know you're anticipating me singing but i'm i'm sorry thank you very much you realize that uh there everybody's telling us and all the news and everything around the world is this virus that escaped and and began to affect people and it began to affect elderly people first they were the most prone to succumb to this and then they had uh people that they they called were asymptomatic and that was people that had the disease but they didn't have any symptoms and they became spreaders and so they didn't know they had it but they could spread it and other people um uh they would get it and and they would just be sick for just a little while and so we had all these different uh scenarios all these different situations that made it very elusive in other words it was hard to pin down and then we had all kinds of different treatments you know this works that works this doesn't work this works and and everything and so i thought you know here is uh a natural sickness that absolutely changed the economy of the world and changed things something that was in the flesh well when i listened to this tape it i i just didn't randomly uh cross it uh it really came upon my heart and the tape of spiritual amnesia and uh you know and i i i thought about a little bit and i went on and then it kept pressing on me again spiritual amnesia and i thought yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna have to get around to that eventually and listen to it and about the third day late you know about the third time and came up a few days later and it just spoke back in my heart spiritual amnesia spiritual amnesia and so i asked a question well first of all go listen to it and then when i begin to listen to this tape i really begin to understand what was being said and i i want us to listen to this go into listening to this this morning understanding that spiritual amnesia is a disease that has struck the church it was a disease that has struck the church and brother rem in this tape he talks about spiritual amnesia what it is what happened what the cause of it is we won't listen to the whole tape we'll listen to 20 minutes of it but the 20 minutes that i want to play for you is to establish to you that this is a disease a spiritual disease that strikes the church and we all have to be extremely careful that we don't catch it and and a physical disease they come and go but you don't want to be caught with something that could cause you to have a spiritual uh death or spiritual thing so i i just don't want it to be like just a sermon but i'd like to kind of make the emphasis this morning that we understand that this is a real thing spiritual amnesia is a real thing and you can have spiritual amnesia and be a carrier of it and infect other people with it not even knowing that you have it and so it is something that we should be aware of as believers we should be uh have an understanding and an awareness that this spiritual amnesia is something that can affect us and and and i'm i encourage you to go listen to this sermon and there's there's signs of that you have it there's symptoms of it there's things that it causes things that it does there's way to look at your life and say i've got amnesia you know there's things that i that are going on that and so because he identifies the church and the disease that they have of spiritual amnesia we just want to take a little look at it this morning and just talk about it just a little bit this morning but i want the reason i want to play this first 20 minutes is i i want us to understand that the prophet messenger to this age identify this as being a disease that the church has okay not just a catchy subject and not just a catchy phrase you know not just a description of describing something but he presents this as an actual disease that's affecting the church and and i i think as as a pastor if there's a disease going out there you know what i mean then you would want to uh warn the flock hey this is the the disease and there's a disease out there and you've got to know the symptoms of it because if you know the symptoms of it then you can do something about it you can treat it you know and you can do the things that are necessary to do and so we want to really establish that that this is something that is out there it's something that is working on the church it is something that's infecting the church and you've got to know the symptoms of it how would you like to have spiritual amnesia and not know it and then your life is spreading it right and so let's just take this a heart that we can stand together and we'll uh and we'll uh listen and we'll read the scriptures the same scriptures that are used in this message it's amos the third chapter the book of amos the third chapter and we'll read and uh and then when he says and then he'll say a prayer and at the end of his prayer he'll say amen and then we can be seated at that time so let us just pray and ask the lord to bless this to us so so listen to it this evening for the understanding in your heart that this is something that's real it's not a myth it's not a description it's absolutely a real disease heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us this morning as fathers we have come for sunday school lesson we've come to become more aware we've come to grow in our understanding we ask you to bless this word to us in jesus name we pray amen god bless you let's remain standing just a moment now for the word of the lord let's turn to amos the prophet amos the third chapter beginning with the first verse i want to thank sister juanita and anna jean and sister moore for that lovely course of songs that brought me back as i said over there and listened to it i was thinking when they were with us singing in the campaign brother jack and i were talking them girls were a little bitty girl just a little 16 something like that girl now i think sister anna jean has five children sister uh um juanita is the mother of two children and we are really close to that sunset women and we was then about 16 years difference won't be long we'll be crossing over by glorious time now in amos the third chapter is reading hear this word that the lord has spoken against your children of israel against the whole family which i brought up out of egypt saying you only have i know on all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for your iniquity can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he has taken no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he's taken nothing can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth or no jinn is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth in haven't taken nothing from it shall the trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evie and evil in the city and the lord has not done it surely the lord will do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servants the prophets the line has roared who shall not fear the lord has spoken who can but prophesy let us bow our heads lord jesus may this thy word lord may we have fellowship tonight around this potion we pray lord that you'll give us a context for the text that we shall take from here in may it bring honor to thee bless us as we're waiting lord tonight upon thy word heal the sick and afflicted save the lost give strength to the feeble lord that's getting weak both physically and spiritually and give us a great outpouring of thy presence for we asked it in jesus name amen i wish to take for a text from this tonight spiritual amnesia don't forget tomorrow it's a prayer for the sick tomorrow we expect the lord to do exceeding great things tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock or we when we begin our services the boy will be here to give out prayer cards and everyone will be prayed for that wants to be prayed for and we're expecting a great time uh tomorrow in the lord now you people are here visiting from out of town remember there's fine full gospel churches all through the city you're welcome to all of them i just talked to one of my associate pastors outside just come in brother uh jackson formerly a methodist church down a city or two below us and how many is sure that's associated with the tabernacle let's see your hands everywhere mom i'm sure we're glad to have you down this is the closest meeting i've been to indiana for quite a while thinking about coming back pretty soon and putting up a tent and having those seven last trumpets the lord willing so now but remember tomorrow don't forget it tomorrow at two o'clock and now our next service will begin next week in tampa florida now i want to speak on spiritual i need amnesia now this little fellow that we're talking about amos just for a moment to get our background before we get to the text this was during the time of the great prosperity in samaria israel had prospered they had really uh went after the world and it prospered not always prosperity is a sign of spiritual blessings but sometimes on the contrary people think maybe you have to own a lot of worldly goods and shows that god's a blessing and that's not true sometimes it's the other way but we find him we don't know much about this little fella he we have no history where he come from we know to you according to the scripture here he's a herdsman but god had raised him up i can imagine seeing on one hot day in samaria there that one of the great tourist cities of the world that there's something on the order of would say miami or or hollywood los angeles some of them places like that some great place for tours and we uh and this imagines him he'd never been in such a city but he had the word of the lord he was coming to this great uh city where sin was heaped on every side the ministers that all got away from the word of god and they hadn't had a prophet in long years and so this little fellow as he topped the hill just uh kind of north of samaria i can imagine seeing the hot sun shining down his grave whiskers over his face his little eyes narrow and his little bald head shine as he looked down upon that city his eyes narrowed he wasn't looking at what tourists usually see to go to a city to see all of his enchantments of beauty he looked and seen what a sight that that city had become a city that once was a city of god and had gotten such a morally decay is that no wonder this little unknown fellow was amos the prophet and now we don't know very much about him we don't know where he come from prophets usually come on the scene unknown leave the same way we don't know where they come from where they go no about their backgrounds god just raises them up he wasn't much to look at but he had thus saith the lord that's the main thing of course he come to samaria to begin his campaign i'm sure he had no cooperation from nobody he had no fellowship card from any uh denomination he had no credentials to show what group he come from and but he had one thing he had the word of the lord for that city and i wonder if we could transport amos today down to our time i wonder if he'd be welcome in our city today i wonder if we would receive him or would we do just like they did we find our cities in the same decay and we find that sin is just great among the people as it was then and i wonder if this little unknown man how is he going to start this campaign how where is he going to begin at what church is he going to or who's going to cooperate with him he had nothing to show where he come from he had nothing at all but thus saith the lord for the city he found them so decayed and so morally corrupted it was a great time the women in that city had become almost like they are in the united states they had become corrupt everything that god had expected out of them they went right the other way and and we'd find that it was a great place where they had dancings on the street the women immorally stripping their clothes and so forth like striptease of course that was a public amusement now days now it's everyday just let the weather get hot and you don't have to go to any show you're all on the street anywhere anyhow shame on you women to do a thing like that you ashamed yourself and um and then i said that to a woman here not long ago and she said why she said the uh brother branham said that that's uh uh that's just like the rest of women i said but we are not supposed to act like the rest of the people we are different we are uh a different character reminds me of a woman said well brother branham another said i i don't wear those sharks that i wear slacks i said that's worse god said it's an abominationally sight for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man it's exactly right one said well they don't make any other clothes they still make sewing machines and have goods there's no excuse it's just what's in the heart that's what shows out it it identifies itself and now we find in this city it become morally decayed the preacher's afraid to say anything about it and uh but they had a little fellow coming up over the hill was coming to tell him thus saith the lord clean this thing up or you're going to go into captivity and he lived to see the days of his prophecy fulfilled he prophesied the days of jeroboam ii which was just a outcast anyhow he he favored the other nations and and lisala amos prophesied and told him he said the very god that you claim to serve he'll destroy you and he did and if his voice would be here tonight in the in birmingham it would claim the same thing to the churches uh very god that you claim to serve will destroy you someday i'm not speaking to this audience here these tapes go around the world now remember that is true then he found out when he come into the city that he all this stuff i wonder how he must have felt to look and see that decay of the people of god to whom he was sent uh i wonder if we would receive him now if he'd come in would we would we cooperate with him would we give him our our best would we give him our attention would we repent if he told us that we should go back to the word of the lord and do the way the lord said i wonder what our sisters would do about their bobbed hair when they let their hair grow out again if aim is gone he'd preach it now i'm telling you that because that's the word of the lord i wonder if our if our boards have put out deacons as married three or four times and and so forth like that trying to be deacons i wonder if all these things i wonder what he would do to man that would let his wife wear sharks and get out in the street out there and mow the yard out in the yard when man is passing by i wonder what he'd say to man like that amen he'd certainly blast it with all that was in him or he had thus saith the lord and he couldn't do nothing else but that he found them in that day with the bad case of a disease spiritual uneasy and that's just exactly what we got today now how did he know what was going to happen how would amos know first he was a prophet and the next thing he knowed by the disease what the diagnosis was and he know what the results was if a doctor looks upon a malignancy and sees that that malignant untucker hold he knows there's nothing but death left that's all unless god does something about it well when you look at a city and you look at a people you look at a church and look at a people it's so far away from god there isn't nothing but to diagnose but sin the wages of sin is death it's dying the diagnosis proves what it is you see when people get away from god and won't listen to the word have no more desire for the word then there's one diagnosis to it the soul that sinneth that soul shall die unbelief shall separate you from god that's exactly right but he knew what the disease what the results was when he seen the disease of of sin in the city now this enemies are we told it is a a cause you to be to a place where you can't not identify yourself now it's an unusual thing it don't happen too often but the causes is from shock it's somebody that don't even know who they are they find it from war sometimes the soldiers get it sometimes people get another thing causes it is weary where he will cause it where he has no virtue to it at all no it's it's skip wary accept faith someone said well my wife you're going to be shot in the morning wouldn't you worry i said no don't think so why i said worry couldn't do enough but make me worse well what good is going to do to have faith i said it might deliver me yes sir see so where he has no virtue to it at all but faith has all virtue believe now weary sometimes calls it and another thing that causes among the people is getting between two opinions that'll cause amnesia and it uh gets you to a place where you you actually what you've done you've lost your reasons you've lost your mind you can't make you don't know who you are you can't identify yourself you can walk around eat everything but you still you can't identify yourself you've got your scholarly education you can same education you had but you don't know where it comes from you don't know who you are where you belong that's amnesia so we're told we are identified uh with our families in this human life by marriage and with our wives we marry and our families identified by the union of our our our marriage and then what to think what if this horrible thing would happen to you and you wouldn't be able to remember who you marry who's your wife which is your children who is your father and mother who is your neighbor that would be a horrible thing then we are identified again can identify ourselves in the human race by having intelligence and being different from the animal life the animal cannot think he just goes with sounds he has no soul and but we're animal life what makes us different we're a mammal but what that mammal is warm blooded animal and we are in the feature of animal but what makes us different we are identified by having a soul a conscience that tells us what's right and wrong now there is a place when you get this amnesia you might get like nebuchadnezzar was who exalted himself one time and god let him think he was an animal and he lived out in the wilderness and and eat grass like an ox and and his uh his hairs grew down his body like eagle feathers and he become the heart of a beast in him see that was amnesia because he had forgotten that he was a king he had forgotten that he was a human being and he thought he was an animal so he acted like a man amen because he forgot he was a human being that's so easy today and we forget sometimes what the christian church is we act like the world that shows that we got spiritual amnesia because you don't act like the christian you act like the world you receive the heart of the world and it causes this here we uh we find that israel had exposed uh got exposed to the world and it fell into this rut and this prophet was sent to dig him out of it if he could and to tell him god by his grace chose israel from all the rest of the families on the earth grace had did that he had given them the choice lands he gave them houses that they never had to build god did that chose them he gave them farms that they never bought he he gave them he gave them food that they never planted he gave them wells that they never dug you gave them victories that they never won he gave them grace that they never merited god did that by his grace for this people israel his chosen his beloved and he said in the bible he found her in the field as a little girl sitting in her own blood and he washed her and cleaned her up and what he done but after god showed all these mercies to her and she got rich she got amnesia and these and she forgot all about where these things come from amen i think that's a picture of usa 1964. it's suffering with the same disease we're great powerful churches we're a great powerful people we're millions in number and we'll forget where these things come from they had a bad case of it after god had been good to him and brought him up from all the heathen lands and made him a separated people separated them to himself he said he took a vine out of another country and planned it over in another country and how he fixed it around to make it grow fruit and be fruitful but the vine forgot where its blessings come from so has god's people in these last days has forgotten what the testimony of being a christian means amen it's again this amnesia has become upon the people they can't identify themselves they um they forgot all about it they had forgot his holiness they had forgot his law the women were living like the rest of the women god's church and his people has always been a separated people uh called out people of peculiar people a holy nation a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices to god the fruits of their lips giving praise to his name god called his church and separated from the world for that very purpose and he given a law and he it must be holy he said i am holy and you must be holy and without holiness no man shall see the lord god said that himself and he called this people to be this type of people but they had forgotten about it they had forgotten his laws and they'd forgotten their morals the women out in the street israelite women out there each one expecting to to be conceived by the holy spirit to bring forth a messiah and then acting like that their character was terrible i want to stop here a minute to say it's the same thing among our peoples today who call themselves christians their character if you would only realize i hope they i hope that you go back and at home and and finish the rest of this and uh and really study it but we wanted just to point out today that the prophet of god identified this as a disease as a spiritual disease and uh he said it's the symptoms of it he says is that you you lost your identity you forgot your identity and you know and uh uh that's a terrible thing when we can't identify ourselves he said if you're identified in your family that's how you that you received your identity you were born into a family and you were raised in a family and and so you you you have your last name that's how you identify yourselves i'm such and such i'm a part of this family even in the old testament in the scriptures they would say such and such the son of such and such such and such begot such and such so when you you lose your identity you lose your family association you don't know where you come from but you know our identity is that we're children of god we've been born of god we've been bought of the lord we've been chosen and elected and purposed and purchased so it can you imagine if you forget that identity you forget that identification of who you are so it causes you to act different and that's what he was trying to point out is that israel was an elected chosen people they were called for a purpose they were elected to show forth something and to represent something that's what their uh identity was that's how they identified themselves they identified themselves in in circumcision you could tell who a jew was by circumcision you could tell by their family name who their associates their their lineage and all those things so they had a real distinct uh real distinct identification that they could tie themselves to and and so when when they had that purpose in their life and they had that calling in their life and they had this separation in their life when they forgot that when when they they no longer remembered that then they became just like the rest of the world and he said that's when amos came in he walked into a city that used to be a city of god a people of god that lived for god their choices was according to the law of god their choices was according to the things that belonged to god but they no longer identified themselves with those things they lost that identity now that's a sign that you have a disease a disease that you can't remember because that's what amnesia is it's the lack of memory it's it's it that you forgot and so when you can see that you don't identify yourself that's like this morning you you were you're here this morning because we've identified ourselves with a message that has been sent from the father we identify that we identify with the fact that that message is the word of god it was promised in the scriptures in this last day that god would raise up a prophet according to the ministry of malachi 4 5. it would be a ministry that had the spirit of elijah we we recognize that we see in the scriptures that it was to be used five times these are the things that we identify ourselves with we believe that that there was a that this ministry was going to be the messenger to lady osea the church age that there would be a church age in the last days that would be blind miserable wretched and have need of nothing a people that had amnesia they forgot who made them they forgot where they're going they forgot there's going to be a judgment they forgot this world is going to come to an end they no longer identify themselves with those those characteristics and so when that begins to happen that's when they begin to to get this amnesia and that's what we're not like the world we're different and if you forget that what happens is you forget your identity you forget that the we we they forget their morals we forget we don't wear high heels we don't wear tight clothes we don't wear low-cut blouses we don't wear those sleeveless things we don't have long hair we don't tell dirty jokes we don't do all these things you know we don't we don't go to the picture show we don't go to the dance hall we don't drink alcohol we don't we don't do those things see because that's our identity and those if we're going to identify with the messenger of the hour then we have to identify with what that he taught [Music] so if now if we forget it and we get amnesia and we don't remember what he stood for we don't remember we have a moral code we don't remember that we're a separated people and our memory comes away and we we're no longer we we don't remember that we forgot that then that that's evidence that you forgot it begins to show up the symptoms of the disease begins to show up you got evidence that you've got it and that's what the messenger looked out at the world and the scripture says they no longer wish to retain god in their thinking they they they totally forgot and if you have amnesia and you don't know who that you are and you don't have anything that identifies you this morning we should be identified by the word of god and and so that works both ways the word of god should identify you so someone should be able to look at the word of god look at your life do a comparison and say this life matches up to the word of god amen if not if we forget that we forget that that my identity what what what what what i am is i'm associated with the word of god i'm identified by the word of god and i identify myself by the word of god so if i should ask you what do you think about this if you've got amnesia no telling what you will say that's right but if you're identified with the word then you if that's your answer you have a word answer if you don't have a word answer you stay still and you wait upon the lord until you have a word answer it's god it's got because if you get this amnesia now remember amnesia means you forgot you can't remember you forgot so with amnesia you forget where you're going you don't know where you're going did you hear him describe it you can have a great a great education you can have these great things you can know all the things but you don't know who you are you don't know where you're going well we cannot forget see amnesia sets in and and we forget that we believe there's a rapture coming we can't forget that we can't let that slip away we can't we can't not let that be on our mind and our identity it's part of it but you've got to see that that amnesia is a disease that that spreads and is being spread it's kind of like unseen the whole world is designed to make you forget about god the scripture says their conscience being snared with a hot iron no longer wish to retain god in their knowledge or their thinking i like this scripture it's found in jeremiah and it's the in the 23rd chapter of jeremiah and and and we'll start with the 24 25th verse if anyone wanted to turn there in jeremiah 23 25 he says i have heard what the prophets say they prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed now you know that a prophet is a new testament preacher so he's saying that i i have heard their sermons i have heard what they preach and he says i it and and he said and i have dreamed i have dreamed and and so he he's mentioning as we go there you know you have a dream that you dream right in other words i i dreamed you know that uh i was on a sinking ship and uh i had just caught the world's record marlin and the ship was going down and i was in a dilemma well that's a dream dream but you have dreams that people have that they dream in other words it's their vision you know this i have a dream of of of having schools in every country and south america or i have a dream of of doing this and i have a dream of accomplishing this and i have a dream of that and and and and so the the word of god saying is i've i have heard them their prophecies their preachings i have a dream of this i have a dream of that you know get a bible in everybody's hands send bibles to russia america sat on this hoax of sending bibles to russia sent millions and millions of dollars to send bibles to russia and you can buy a bible in russia but it like was a dream i remember a man had a dream that he was and he collected money for this dream he was getting everybody to send in money and he was going to put bibles and balloons and float them over uh cuba oh that's for real he sold that to the people okay and i say that because that's the spiritual amnesia listen to what listen to as we read the scriptures he said i i have i he said lying in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed and if you listen he says how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophesying of the deceit of their own heart you see so it's not you know you i want you to say the nurse they have a different vision they've got a different vision and and they they deceive the people with their heart so you have to understand the listen all these different visions all these different ideas all these different things that people uh want are are coming up with you got to be careful what you lend your ear to what you let influential what gets you pulled off what what sucking you is because there's a reason that they do that there's a purpose behind it and listen what he says here he says it prophesies the seed in their heart which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal what's the purpose of it they're sowers of amnesia they want you to forget that they're they're trying to to to get us to forget what our identity is forget what we stand for forget what we've associated with because they got another vision they got another dream they've got another idea what do they want to do they want us to forget the word of the lord they want you to forget your identity they want us to forget that we're identified with this message of this hour and so we we can we can see that part of of what amnesia is is when you forget what you're identified with you forget who you are you forget the purpose that you've been raised up another good scripture if if we look at it is like deuteronomy 8 and 2. so the spreader of amnesia the reason they're spreading amnesia is to get you to forget oh that's what the world does it gets you to forget it's it's substitute after substitute and now this morning i want us to just really let this soak in this is a real disease that's what he said there's a spiritual disease called amnesia it's a disease that causes you to forget forget that you were bought with a price forget that you were sealed with the seal of redemption to forget and if he can get you to forget then you become ineffective listen to this beautiful scripture in judah deuteronomy 8 and 2. he says and thou shalt remember all the ways which the lord thy god led thee these 40 years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thy heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not that's he says thou shalt remember yes sir thou shalt remember so the opposite of memory is amnesia so you have some you have a spirit a disease that's out there a disease it's it's it's a worse disease than c19 it's a worse disease than than than than you can imagine it's worse than leprosy because jesus said fear not him who can destroy the body but that can delivereth the soul into hell now this disease of amnesia it's an identified disease in the church by a messenger sent from god vindicated of god fulfilling malachi 4 5 fulfilling luke 17 30. amen fulfilling revelations 3 and 14. a real disease and i want you i want you to get it this is not a sermon you understand this is the lord telling the church there's a disease moving in our midst spiritually the whole world is full of lies and dreams visions and ideas ways to become rich ways to do this ways to do that and what is the purpose of it they're spreading amnesia we've got to be we got to know that that the the fruits of the world and the things of the world are there to cause the christian to forget to entice them into forgetting their identity entice them into forgetting their association especially by putting us into circumstance is where it's a little bit embarrassing for you to identify ourselves we were looking one time to have a place to hold a little men's retreat and we had a place lined up and then when the person found out and they went and studied out a little bit and then they called us back and says you're not welcome here we said why not he says because you of what you believe i mean we're not welcome here because we won't take the mark of the beast i mean really we're not welcome here because we believe in the one and only true god and his son jesus christ who shed his blood for us we're not welcome here yeah all them that live righteous in in christ jesus shall suffer persecution all them that live godly all them that remember their identity they remember what they're standing for they're not going to forget they're not going to forget you don't think shadrach meshach and abednego might have had second thoughts no they remembered i am the lord thy god thou shalt have no other gods before me o king live forever i don't know if our lord will deliver me or not but this i remember i will not bow down to any other god than the lord god almighty amen sometimes you have to go into the fire but he said forget not how that i led you and the ways that i led you that's what amnesia is we forget how we were saved we forget the price that was paid for us we forget the power that was imputed to us instead of god being our first choice he becomes our last choice so we we've got as we begin to see that that that this great amnesia is is something that that it it's a disease this morning we could read in peter ii peter and you know first peter's the statue of a perfect man and listen what he says he says in the seventh verse he says add to godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins you see he he has forgotten he was purged from his own sin i just want to read now just a few statements and maybe you could find them and put them on the board and we're going to read out from paragraph 70 in the same message and as we listen to these things verb is going to start saying this shows you've got amnesia this shows you've got amnesia when you can't identify yourself you understand you've got amnesia when you can't identify yourself with hebrews 13 8. you can't place yourself in that promise you're not sure that's for you you're you're suffering some things came on you something some spirit some situation some uh some sort of uh i don't know what to call it trap has got you to a place where you don't recall that and that's what amnesia is you can't recall anything no identity no don't know where you're going and remember the story in this book where that the soldier got off the train and saw the tower saw the town and he recalled something and he finally worked his way to his father's house he says when the world and the church joins itself together then they don't want nothing spiritual they don't want the saith the lord they want what they want they want the world and to say they're a christian and live like the world and live with the world and live like the world and still maintain their confession of being a christian you know the thing of it is it's spiritual amnesia so spiritual amnesia's got the symptoms the symptoms identify the disease remember he just said that so if you've got these symptoms then you understand that this amnesia is starting to affect you you understand it's a disease a disease is something from the outside that comes in and affects you what was a cancer it's a radical cell it's an outside life living in your body feeding on your cells in order that it can grow it doesn't it it doesn't have a right to your body but there's so much fear about it and there's so much money being made by it that the world wants you to forget that there's a god that drives that life out so they create an amnesia on the people that god's a healer that's the first thing a doctor ought to say he ought to walk in your room and say jesus christ can make you well i'll do everything i can to help them i'll do everything that i know but don't put your faith in me don't put your faith in medicine put your faith in him last thing on the list we've got amnesia do you understand medicine and i believe in doctors don't you misunderstand that but that's become one of the places that the world and christianity has come together by pushing divine healing out of the gospel think of it you know this we're not we're not accusing anybody what we're trying to do this morning is make all of us aware that there's a spiritual disease out there that's being spread the scripture says no like i coded earlier no longer wishing to retain god in their knowledge god's giving them over to what a reprobate mind so we've got to sit here this morning and be a hundred percent aware that there's a disease that i've got to watch out for it's trying to affect me and infect me spiritually i've got to know the symptoms so i can stand and take the word and treat it he said he says you know the thing of it is it's spiritual amnesia that's exactly what it is they don't know who they are they've forgotten what they are supposed to do a christian is supposed to act a certain way if one would come today like that it would be rejected just the same they had a bad case of it so have and so have they today they could not identify themselves with the supernatural things anymore because they didn't want it the word the gospel they didn't want it sin disease had affected them and they loved that so one of the signs of spiritual amnesia is now it's not you believe this is that you can't identify yourself personally with the supernatural another i believe that everybody else that god's a healer but i don't believe he's my healer i believe god does miracles but he doesn't do miracles for me see it's not you it's the amnesia that the world put on you that dreamers put on you and and and ministries and things put on the people so they don't identify themselves the supernaturals for me i have a supernatural help i look at them to heaven for whence cometh my help it's a sign the disease is for a real disease think of it like the black plague think of it as something that's being spread because it gets spread in conversation it gets spread in action it gets spread by atmosphere you should identify be able to identify when there's an amnesia atmosphere when you're talking to a person and you can look at them and say man they forgot that they've been bought with a price they forgot that god's their healer my sin is pleasant to the unconverted heart it looks good to the unconverted mind but it's the way of death there's nothing left but unconverted mind but it's the way of death there's nothing left but death the wages of sin is death and you must reap them wages you've sowed to the winds now reap the whirlwind the spiritual sign and the preaching of an ordained messenger from god never stirred them anymore well i hope that ain't happening with us if you have quit listening to tapes you are suffering with amnesia the spiritual sign and the preaching of an ordained messenger from god never stirs them anymore the woman could laugh right in their face and say i don't have to hear such stuff as that if that hasn't repeated again what is it spiritual amnesia exactly what it is they have forgotten that god and his word is the same and he can not change it can you imagine when if if we're going to play a tape i'll tell you if i was going to say i'm going to play a tape tuesday night you should say man i want to go hear the messenger you should rather want to hear the messenger than me then you say well why aren't you playing tapes because the word of god said to preach the gospel and those that just say that have forgot they've got spiritual amnesia and they forgot what the prophet taught they have a dream paragraph 78. you must identify you must be identified now understand that you must be identified so god has a way to identify you what's the first way god identifies you by the token you've placed the shed blood on your life you look through the blood and he looks back through the blood and when the bread hits red it's white so you must be identified don't think that's the spirit of lady osea they're neither hot nor cold they're unidentifiable he said i would that you'd either be hot or cold because if you're hot or cold you're identified if you're cold he can do something if you're hot he can use you but if you're lukewarm you're unidentifiable you've got amnesia you've just got it it's not bad to have it what's bad is when you recognize you've got it and don't do anything about it you must be identified somewhere you must show your life shows tonight where you are identified you are identified either in christ or not of christ you are not halfway there is no such thing as a drunk sober man there is no black white bird you're either saved or you are not saved you are a saint or a sinner one or the other and your spiritual attitude towards god's word identifies you exactly where you're standing god's word vindicated proved that the baptism of the holy ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of pentecost or any other time and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not think of it what's your attitude towards the baptism of the holy ghost is it just the same as it was on the day of pentecost it does the same thing it anoints the same way it's just as real as it was then so he says now look at your attitude if you're not hungering and thirsting for the things of god if you don't want that baptism in your life and you don't want that covering your life what's happened is is you've contacted spiritual amnesia you've started talking to somebody you started fellowshipping with things and you've got the amnesia especially you young people you young teenagers 13 14 15 16 17 years old that that you've got to watch because even girls in the church can all get together and they can all act start acting silly and they can all start forgetting about god and they can all start gossiping and doing little boy games and talk it's amnesia and then you know what you identify yourself with you identify yourself with rebellion you know when they're going to rebel against their mothers and they're not going to do and they all support one another you be mad at your mother i'll be mad at my mother and then we'll get together and talk about how lame does everybody still remember that word okay you know how out of touch mom is you know and they don't understand and they don't know no most of your parents don't want you to do the things that they did they know they know the price that's paid i've sat down with young girls and told them you go this way this is what's going to happen to you and beg them don't go with that crowd don't go with that boy don't start talking on the phone every night to a boy don't start seeing him don't start sneaking out of the house to go see him don't start doing this don't start passing those you're too young to build a relationship and get something going especially if that boy is older than you because he only has one thing on his mind it's not your soul it's your flesh and when he's done with it he's done with you that's the word of the lord [Applause] all you will end up with is spiritual amnesia don't let somebody talk you in to forgetting your god don't do it don't let anybody talk you in i didn't have anybody i was raised a catholic all i knew i could do whatever i want and jump into that box and it would be all over you know the one thing they never told me that you reap what you sow the sin was forgiven maybe in my case they were forgiven before the foundation of the world praise god but he said if you sin you sow the seed of sin you will reap a whirlwind and the first thing before you can sin is you've got to leave the word and they're trying to get you to forget with words of flattery believe me when a guy tells you you're the prettiest thing i've ever seen you better step back because his noses are growing because prophet god said you don't marry for beauty you marry for character amen amen amen that's you mary or character if a guy tells you oh you're so beautiful and you're this and you're all that and he never addresses your character that's a bum because he he don't have no character a real guy said you know i really appreciate the way you obey your mother really appreciate the way that you heard your mother and if he's got character he's got respect and he won't start knocking on your door until you've reached an acceptable age of your parents i got myself out of that one amen you know i don't know 18 i don't that's that's not for me to decide you know a a a daddy never feels his daughter's always too young but i'll tell you what a father does he knows a man of character and if you've got a real born again father you you just keep in mind if he tells you to watch yeah he says you are a saint or sinner or the other and your spiritual attitude towards god's words identifies exactly where you're standing right and it proves uh it's the same as the day of pentecost and then he let's just read that paragraph 79 god's word it did is proves that the baptism of the holy ghost the same as it ever was in the day of pentecost or any other time jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not is your attitude towards is jesus christ the same today that's right no matter what whatever you you're a deacon or whether you're a preacher it doesn't mate yeah they get it too so we find out it's contagious and hits the whole thing doesn't matter who you are you can get it too it's contagious how many understand there's a real disease out there amen a real disease called spiritual amnesia let's go to paragraph 102. you guys able to find it now i find myself in this last days with the many of the believing christians identified in his ministry he's the same yesterday today and forever i find myself in this day identified in his ministry do you find yourself that way believing it walking with it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same thing the works that i do shall you also then can you be identified with him then when the reproach comes on the word can you stand the reproach like he did see identified him as i was identified with him i was with him on the day of pentecost i was with the disciples up there identified with them in the baptism of the holy ghost i wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much how that they don't some of them don't even believe there's such a thing as the holy ghost now take that don't don't just i believe in the holy ghost no are you mindful the holy ghost is there did you hear what bill graham said and when we played that tape he says is that thus saith the lord can you go there and say it's thus saith the lord can you do this and say it's thus saith the lord i mean are you conscious you feel his presence you know the anointing though what i'm trying to say is the whole world is constantly trying to get you to forget him to forget about him forget about it's the holy spirit that will lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness i will not leave you comfortless i'll be there for you i will lead you forget not how that i led you in the wilderness though this amnesia is real see where the church has got a very bad case of amnesia see they've forgotten that was jesus christ back there they have forgotten that jesus was they have forgotten they thought he was a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot that he was god they forgot that he's the same yesterday and forever and the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia they have forgot all these things they don't understand it no more ask yourself are you forgetting to understand the message are you forgetting why god sent a messenger is it important to you that you have a storehouse that you have an absolute you see this spirit this disease this sickness is trying to get us to what forget it's what amnesia is it's the failure to remember we sang that song i think it was count your blessings can you imagine if you forget your blessings if you counted your blessings and you had a list and you counted it again and you came up five short what happened to the other five you forgot them you forgot them you forget you forget where you come from you can't see afar off and have forgot that you've been purged from your sins it's a real disease church it's a real disease this is a thing from the spiritual disease control center there's an outbreak a spiritual pandemic of amnesia he said they forgot that he's the same yesterday there and the church has got a bad case of spiritual amnesia they have forgotten all these things they don't understand it no more then let's read go to paragraph 106. don't get spiritual amnesia because you you will you'll identify yourself with something else stay right with the word we was with the church when it was commissioned by jesus christ in acts the 16 16th chapter go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature i want to be identified there all the world to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe can be identified in that well we are well now you are identified with that or you have got spiritual amnesia and there is do you personally identify yourself with that i'm commissioned to go into all the world and tell if you don't identify yourself with that somebody has passed amnesia on you and you've got to fight it off you've got to start applying thus eye salve that thou mayest see well are you identified with that or have you got some spiritual amnesia some just a little some spiritual amnesia that you find out you don't believe those signs follow the believer see if you don't believe it then you have spiritual amnesia see you've got you forgot that god promised that he said these signs shall follow them that believe don't forget it you can't forget it and be a christian you must be identified with it you must be identified with saint john 14th chapter the 12th verse he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also don't forget it if you do then you've got spiritual amnesia you forgot who you are you've forgotten what your testimony means that's a good question what your testimony means we're closing oh it's a little long but it's just i really want to lay this down how about he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it will be done for you are you identified there to believe that is the truth mark 11 when he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said can you identify there to believe that that is the truth if it hasn't then you're getting spiritual amnesia and you forgot you lose your christian balance you can't tell where you belong i'm a methodist i'm a baptist that's what i know about i'm pentecostal and this that and the other watch out that may mean that the disease sign is showing on you and you've got some spiritual amnesia 215 115 you say i don't believe that god's promise to do these things in the last day then you've listened to a creed or some doctrine instead of the bible you have spiritual amnesia you don't know where you where you do belong then you're confused you're confusing a christian and denying the word brings you right back to spiritual amnesia again see don't you know where you stand you've got spiritual amnesia you can't identify yourself with the scriptures 23rd paragraph but what happens just can't identify ourselves no more with the word why she don't know whether she's a lodge or whether she's a church she don't know what to be called a lodge and she can't be called a church because to be called a church you would identify yourself with christ that gives spiritual amnesia so we've got a bulletin from above saying there's a disease that's trying to sweep through our lives and get us to cause us to forget the power of the resurrection to try to get us to forget that we are truly the sons and daughters of god that we've been purchased with a price our name's been put on a lamb's book of life and one day soon he's coming to take us back to where we belong don't get this amnesia church go back and look at what your testimony means go back and remember what he's done for you go back and count your
