Description:
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
February 7, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

so thankful in this day that we have a a bleeding bloody Living Word father that we're gathered under Lord that's declared us the Spotless bride of Jesus Christ Lord we ask now as we just come to you father that you'd be the one that would Minister to each need you're the only one father that could walk these aisles and speak to each one individually Lord and break the bread of life Lord and we'll give you the thanks for that father we'll give you the glory and we just commit it all to you in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles and just turn with me into Genesis 1 we're going to take a text uh and just read through we know Genesis is the seed chapter it's where we see the beginning of all things we see the true intent of God and and as we've been fellowshipping I just enjoyed the continuity of God's word and just the fellowship that we've had and the things that the ministry has brought and we're just going to take a text from Genesis 1:1 as it reads and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yelding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the the Earth and it was so just skip on down the 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let us and let them have dominion over the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the Earth God bless you we ask that you to have your seats as the Lord just bless the reading of his word where you read his word it can't return void and the the promise and the reason we took this text as we see here in the very beginning a proclamation that that we've been fellowshipping on is that each seed has to bring forth of his kind and when you look into the Book of Genesis we see here God creating Adam in his very image giving him dominion over the land Over the Sea over the foul over the air over every living thing but in here is a is a promise or a commission that he would be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and when we look at this promise it's before even Adam is formed Out of the Dust of the earth it's it's it's a beautiful image that our prophet's able to take us to see is that in this image Adam is a spirit in the very image of God for God is a spirit and he's complete but yet there's this Proclamation that he'd be fruitful so we want to see the seed form that Adam is in here is a perfect image it's a seed image it's the image of God it and it's I I say complete because Eve is in him at this point right it she's not yet taken now Adam is not yet made in the image of a beast forming the in the dust of the earth if you follow the teaching of of our prophet he lets us know that here Adam is now made in the image and when he talks about it and and we'll just I guess we could read it here um if you read on down in Genesis uh 2 and7 it says and the Lord formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed in him the nostrils in his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul and uh many theologians get confounded at this they they're they're so diluted in their thinking they have no wisdom a Godly understanding that they would try to make this two oratories of the same creation but thank God for a prophet who could come and tell us what this creation is because we find ourselves there and we find ourselves receiving the same commission be fruitful and multiply okay that that is a promise I love the way that the prophet would put it it's just one line I'm taking here from spoken words the original see but brother brandom said God promised to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time and I I love that because when you read that scripture if you put it up and you're looking at Genesis when he says in the in uh verse one and he says he blessed them and God said to them in verse uh 20 28 be fruitful and multiply and uh just making sure I finding my place with you here if if most of us would read this you would almost read as a command right you You' think that there was something they were to accomplish something they were to do and and yet here God is it's a promise and that's when you're in the right channel I I appreciated my brother Matthew is sharing a thought it was what was the mistake that they made when they received the Commandments when God was asking to do they took it upon themselves as we'll do this and you take a look at what that was the very provocation to Eve was hey here's this promise you could be as Gods you could know both good and evil and you can bring forth this life this is your way of doing it and it's the same and what did that seed produce It produced a can right and and what did true to its father it it approached what can I do I will I'll make a a beautiful offering I'll bring the labor of my the field and the toil of my hands and I'm going to bring something beautiful and I'm going to take pleasure in the offering that I bring and yet here's a paradigm and I think every child of God is faced with this what can I bring there's there's there's no fruit in my hands there's no labor that I could bring and there's a there's something in the heartbeat of a Son of God that says I want to produce the life I want to produce this seed how can it be done I have no life of myself but it's the promise that he said multiply replenish the Earth and and we're living under that promise amen I thank the Lord for that we're not living by a man's idea we're not living by man's effort we're living by the spoken word of God The Original Seed so here's the promise to multiply to replenish it's a promise that the seed would bring forth of its kind and it's going to set there man bypasses it he goes his own way but there it is God's going to fulfill his word because we want we know one thing God's word can't return void if he's spoken it he's going to accomplish it just and now here's the pattern if he said let there be light there's going to be light the he he proves himself throughout creation he comes to this and he says multiply and now many may think that was fulfilled but we know through a prophet's message that sets there and then Isaiah would pick it up Hallelujah and he would he would catch the inspiration of it but I want you to notice now the predestin ated seed of that is something that you as a Believer or partaker in you are that fruit you are that one that's been born again because the seed of God sets there predestinated you know the SE work many people take the sewer they think God is just uh walking along spreading seed and and just somehow casting it but I we we uh planted some tomato seeds recently you know in Texas you got to get ahead of the Season you can't just wait that The Season's limited so you actually have to be planting your seeds now uh because otherwise by the time they're just coming to fruit that's going to be too hot and they're just going to choke out we've tried to grow tomatoes enough to learn that so you're starting the seed and you're being diligent you're taking that seed you know exactly what you're planning I'm planting tomatoes you're putting in the soil and you know exactly where you're putting it I mean some people even go put spoons or labels or whatever and if Ming is intelligent is doing that do you think God doesn't know where he planted his seed okay that it's a predestinated seed he's for ordained it and he put it into Earth and vessels and it's in you amen I there's enough signs in history in your life to be sitting here tonight that we should not doubt the foreordination of God that you're sitting here hearing the spoken word of God by a prophet messenger and we've gathered underneath it in this day we can we should be rejoicing we should be beyond the the idea of wondering what he's planted in US I mean let's face it I don't you think the devil's tried to discourage every single one of you here you're not good enough you've you've you've sinned the way the day of Grace you you've gone too far um you you know but where are you at you should stand here right now and you could say boo devil you yeah I me myself I there was a point just in recent weeks I didn't know ID be here I could say thank you Lord we should have the confidence of all people to be able to look Satan in the eye and say you can't stop this it's going to take a stronger win than this you can't keep the seed from coming forth and declaring what God's foreordained it to declare who planted it right praise be to God our confidence is so sure in this day I mean and all glory goes to God now I like this so there's a way we know this you know this is not uh there there's a there's an order that God has the the bedding ground you know there's the seed and there's the beding ground I the scripture is too clear in the types for us to just think that uh there's not a if you will a natural element to this it's all played out and type there's going to be an element where we have to be a husbandman what was the Commandment of to Adam in the very beginning to have dominion so you now have a soil that you need to be tilling that you need to be the husbandman of that you need to be exercising dominion over because you've been given Dominion anything that tells you that this flesh is bigger than you is a lie it's dead at Calvary you're you're you can reckon Yourself Dead there and and if you haven't come to recognize that there's a you can find that you have to let the dation and the travel run its course and don't settle for a a a thirst a perverted thirst that keeps you short of having that seed die out so that Christ can live and sometimes that's a daily dying out you don't think this thing comes back and and you Your Own Worst Enemy so that's what we're dealing with is a betting ground Mary I I like like this brother Brandon in Mary's belief would say and Mary knew that she had just read the day before I Isaiah 9:6 that something was about to happen and she knowed it was on the way she was in the word feeding she was now she's feeding on a truth for her day it's being quickened to her a prophet's message in time in season Finding the betting ground of Mary and it's being now Quicken to her and if and what is this Isaiah 9:6 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace Hallelujah so where is that now that's a prophetic word a spoken word that's being quickened in the bedding ground it had to come in through her she had to read the word she had to hear the word it had to come in and then it had to be quickened now the mystery of this is is is that the seed of God in its season will always be anointed it will always be quickened you you're you're not going to find the seed of God in the season without the anointing because the very Commission of the Hol the reason you can't separate the Holy Spirit and the word is the very holy spirit is given to brood out over the word to bring it to pass he didn't do it any other away in the very beginning the very seeds of the earth were there and the spirit of God brooded upon the face of the waters and brought it to pass the mystery is is that the very same Holy Spirit would brood over false seed now there is no place you will find the word of God sitting there and not being quickened in it's time in its season it's always quickened it's quickened by anointing it's Quicken by the spirit because that's you know that you don't put a seed in the ground and not water it I mean I don't know I you know maybe there is I'm sure some scientists could find I just don't know of a seed that's Quicken without moisture you know I if it's out there maybe but in plant life I pretty sure you need certain things to germinate the seed and it God the invisible things of God being clearly manifest in the things around us you can't can't live without the anointing in the spirit of God and it's given to you if the rain can fall on the unjust in the morning when we rise we want to be saying Lord Quicken the seed germ in me today by your presence anoint me go before me send your angels before me let me know you're with me and and there's a there's a thing here that is important when you possess the word of God we're not walking by sensation all right now follow me on this because if you're possessing the word of God in its time and season that's the faith seed to know that he's there looking out over his word that's all the confidence you need amen that's something that's different about the believer that Pentecost rejected they couldn't understand the word birth they couldn't understand that the faith of God could be imparted to someone to Quicken the word and they could have a born again experience they wanted to manufacture an Evidence when the very evidence is the fruit that it produces Hallelujah what's the seed of Jean got in you producing what's the fruits of the spirit that's coming out and then if it's not producing the fruit I don't care how anointed you are you need there's a way repent that's the fallacy is people create a false evidence so they can avoid the conviction of God they they want to claim to be children of God because of some false evidence when they need to be born again and they need to repent and it that goes for wearing a message religious cloak you want to take this message and use it and and think you've got some entitlement and the Very fruits that's living in your life just Lord help us we don't you know religion's a is a is a a blinding spirit a way Seth right unto a man and the and the end thereof is death you you want to understand how close it is that could deceive the very elective possible and you have to understand now the setting that brother brandham is in when he sits there and he goes to that meeting as a young Minister and he's sing seeing the Holy Spirit now move and the gifts operating and one of them being a true genuine seed and one of them not and the confusion that that brings I'm so thankful that we don't have to be confused okay what you can be certain of is that the rain does fall okay and you must live by it you must live by it but what you don't you're not going to be choked out by the tears you're not going to be choked out by that false Vine you're not going to be confounded that there's going to be those who named this message and they don't live it now there's Grace right because this message is pruning and that we we want to progress um and go forward that's a little of the thought today um as we were just seeking the mind of the Lord and and trying to to have a little quietness um a a couple trucks showed up out in front of the house and I look out the window and there's these big green trucks with some owl on it and a hat and some guys come out and all of a sudden there's about an hour or two of chainsaws and I'm just and I'm just sitting there going dear Lord I know your Will's in this I'm trying to be settled I'm a very as a sound guy I very sensitive to sound and so I just sitting there a moment I go outside well what are they doing they got to maybe they're going to remove one of these Elms maybe they're going to be doing something I look and they're trimming up a tree tree and they're climbing and they're being careful they're deadwooding it and I sitting there as thinking and I was drawn to this and in Mark 4: 11 it's the parable of the swer and there's something that happens in this we know that there's many grounds that the seed would Fallen if we could take the time just to read it starting in chapter 11 we'll try to progress but there's something that stuck to me out to me in that and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto them that are without all these things are done in Parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sin should be forgiven them now now that speaks of a very heart intent in the sewing of the word of God you can say is it you know in the Book of Revelations blessed are the eyes and ears that hear the prophecy of this book you can if you have been giving understanding if you've been giving eyes to see it's because he's opened your eyes to see and and so many of these things they're imparable to people they can see the type but we're the living word of this amen and he said unto them know ye this Parable and how that then will you know all Parables The Seer Seth the word and these are they that by the wayside were the where the word is s but they that heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts and these are they like likewise which are sown on Stony ground who when they had heard the word immediately received it with gladness and have no root in themselves and so endure for but a Time afterwards when Affliction and persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended and these are they which are sown among Thorns such as that hear the word and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of the things that enter in choke out the word and becometh unfruitful so what's the Commandment in the very beginning be fruitful what's going to make you unfruitful and just you can go back anytime you want to know things that can cause you to be unfruitful Jesus is laying this out there for you cares deceitfulness the the any you know lust of this world any temporal pleasure so many times we're faced with the choice do something that's not expedient that's not profitable it's it's maybe not unlawful but is it spiritually profitable and it's so easy to do something that's not profitable it helps it causes you to be unfruitful and these are they which are sown in good ground thank you Lord such as hear the word of God and receive it and bring forth fruit some 30-fold some 60 and some 100 and I I pray that whatever wherever we're at we want to be hundredfold so there's a process by which we're going to get to the H hundredfold amen and that is through when he says these things there's a a promise that's given and it's in John 15 1-8 he says I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman when they were climbing the trees I was watching the care that they were giving every branch anch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and so what they were doing in the tree is they're doing what they called deadwooding all right they're looking at the branches and they're saying this one isn't producing fruit and they're cutting it away and they're doing it in the right season and the right time with care and you don't want someone who doesn't know what they're doing pruning the bride tree you don't need to be letting something that's not the message of this hour do any pruning on you it's going to kill you it's going to cut off a branch that's supposed to be producing fruit we're not as the bride of Christ the wound is sealed all right we're not here receiving man's idea we're not dabbling in theology we're not dabbling in in philosophy if that if you're tantalized by those things it's a weakness all right let let the Lord take that weakness and turn it into a strength but commit that to him we don't want itching ears Forever Learning this this that you don't turn this message and the heartbeat of God and the Love Letter it is into a Theology and you do that you're going to the very first thing you're going to do is start mixing it with other things that sound good and it it's just not what it's for every branch that beareth not for he taketh uh taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that's the word that struck me he purges it that it might bring forth more fruit so if we want to bring forth more fruit there's going to be a purging and I how are we purged amen if you if you look in Ephesians uh it's a verse 26 he says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word amen I I actually just reading that I know there was several things that really struck to me if we could turn that to that scripture I think it' be worth just taking a look at that um this is a a a chapter that means a lot to me and especially in my my youth I I think I saw Redeeming the time up in verse 16 and thought of all the things that I had done the days that were evil and I and I was like you know how do we redeem the time but we're just looking here in in 26 that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word and if you back up this is bookended quite beautifully in verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing by the water of the word that he might present it to himself a glor glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish amen so what's the purging going to bring forth a bride what's the word in our day doing it's washing us it's cleansing us from all unbelief there's a message that is dressing a bride amen and just even earlier in Ephesians if you want to look it it goes over what the fruits of the spirit are and what the the purging should be allowing to present and to bring forth amen but it's it's in that pruning and that purging that's where you find most people will make their mistake because it's supposed to be a point and in time where maybe the tree looks a little more Barren maybe it looks a little more bare there's not the branches and I that's the the time where instead of being patient and letting the the work take its place often man tries to manufacture something and instead of letting that pruning process and that purging process take course that's where you find people run after a covering they run after they they they don't want the nakedness exposed they don't want the pruning of the word they're going to want to have uh something they play a part in and and the the patience to wait on God and know that if he's purging and his pruning it's going to bring forth fruit we just want to wait on God when we're when we're being uh pruned no chastisement is Pleasant at the time but in the end it's going to bring forth fruit it's going to be fruitful you want to deny yourself you want to deny your ideas and and allow those things to be cut away amen and it's it's in that that we find that it's the very dressing of a bride it's the dress wear that this word is is performing in the pruning and the washing and the purging in it it is speaking to the heart and tent of a bridegroom that has a desire that the bride would be dressed in a certain way that she would have an attribute that reflects him she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh the very thing when when Eve is taken out of Adam the Declaration is bone of my bone Flesh of My flesh and we see that's the very thing that happens again in the New Testament when he's speaking of the Bride it's going to be a bride that's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh that's the image of who he is that they're one and the same when they when one reflects the other it's declaring the attributes of who he is and spoken word is the Original Seed brother brandham says in paragraph 73 he says them kind that takes the word is God 's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen did you get it she can't die CU she's that child can't die CU he's a word child he's a seed child he's an eternal child Hallelujah so the be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth is something that the bride of Christ in this day is manifesting because she is bearing word children and that child can't die one of the things brother Brandon would say is that you have the power to impart eternal life what are you carriers of the word the very word Gene of God and if you're carrying the word then it can produce the very life of God it's the very thing that can quicken in your brother and your sister Sons and Daughters of God we should always be one to be willing vessels that can be in the place in the season to be speaking the word of God Amen and your confidence is is that seed can't return void I love that quote I'm just going to read it again them kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word amen did you get it I I say Lord help me get it the confidence that we should have in the seed that's in US is that it's going to produce we're a bride that's been brought to the point of expectancy that we're producing the very likeness and image of God and that it's going to be fruitful it's going to multiply and it's going to replenish and it's to his glory this is his desire seed was there's no lying when the fruit comes out there's no wonder anymore what the seed was there's no guesswork they might grow up together they might that may look alike there may be a there may be a shook but there's a pulling away there's a separating and it's that's the pruning that's the separating you know that's that's the time of despisement that's the time when Deus th for forsaken me that's the time when the the world wants to sit and despise this message you know brother brandom in the Peaks there's a low time there's a time where you may think that it's not Victory you may think that there's nothing happening that's the time to be bold in your faith Satan you think you got me Satan you think that this is the end of it you try to tell me I'm sick you try to tell me I send away my day of Grace but the seed of God enies testifying to something else amen it's telling me that I'm going to produce it may be 30 fold today but it's going to produce 100 fold you ain't seen nothing yet I'm not going to settle there's a point in time where you say you know what was it that was happening to that son of of Israel is the devil's coming and taking the fruit of his land he's coming in he take you know just at the time of harvest as he's labored and he's toiled the devil's going to come and say it it's mine I'll take this I'll show you how to shout I'll show you how to praise this is my fruit watch my singers watch my worldly imitation that's mine that don't belong to you you think your bride you can't praise like I can praise you think you got to dance in the camp why don't you just tune in the Pentecostal church over here and we want to model ourselves after that I'm you know what you may think this bride ain't producing fruit but you just wait around and see you just watch who's doing the victory dance up yonder you just watch this bride dressed in Glory Hallelujah partaking of his righteousness what is it it's a righteous tree there ain't no unrighteousness in it it's partaking in his righteousness right that's the bride tree amen let let's just take a a look at this brid tree for a second she's she might be being pruned she may look like she's despised in this day the scriptures fulfilled brother Brandon would say in paragraph 151 now but in the day there is to come a super Royal Seed of Abraham that's exactly this is word we could we're receiving this this is a prophesied word in its season to a bride I this message is life that's exactly what it would be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it's a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride rise up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham royal son she's to come on the scene in in the last days and the time and the place is a promise the time and the place is a promise I these words aren't by chance a man can't speak like this this is a a love letter to the bride the time and the place is a promise that is given to her what does a husband do he betroths a wife he gives her a promise why do you think the devil hates the type of man and wife in Christ in a church why is he so against it because it's a promise according to Malachi 4 is scripture there would rise a message that would shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again there's to rise one on the scene in the power of Elisha that will rise on the scene in the wilderness man that would come out and have the message that'll run right straight back to the word again that's the hour that we're living in then consider now I ask you at this hour you people here of Jeffersonville and 1933 the supernatural light that fell Yonder on the river that day when I was baptizing the fifth hour in the name of the Lord Jesus about a 20 year-old boy and what did I say Jefferson Bill what was it at the foot Spring Street there when the Carrier Journal I believe that it was in the Lewisville heral packed the article of it I went Plum across the Associated Press Plumb into Canada Dr leel cut it out of the paper way up in Canada everybody's testifying to this it's going out in the writing something happened on the river and when I was baptizing my 17th person under this witness that you know the rest of the story and when I was standing there baptizing the seventh person Alik come down from heaven shining above there like a star fallen from the heaven of voice said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message shall forerun his second coming all the world this day this scripture is fulfilled go listen to this day the scripture is fulfilled what was he declaring to have happened Oh my he would pick this up in present stage of my Ministry and you'd read Elisha the book of Isaiah in the 61th chapter let's turn there you know he would bring there he'd say Jesus Took the book in this day the scripture is fulfilled he read it what did he read he declared the acceptable year of the Lord what a beautiful thing what the acceptable year is it's Jubilee Hallelujah we've heard a call that resounded the Jubilee there is no bondage is sickness sickness of the Mind sickness of the body and there's a jubilee call there's no more a hindrance to us to walk out and freedom sickness is defeated that's a line vanity you know why it's there so your faith can be built so he could put that sickness under your foot you can say devil if he can manifest a temporal healing in this body I'm taking a body change and I'll Stand Here Right Now the devil tried to gave me a cancer try to put a fear on me but who's standing here the victory is real ain't no fairy tale ain't no Fable it's a Living Word well let's get there let's look at Isaiah 61 the spirit of the Lord Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good things under the Beek Jesus Christ himself did he come without anointing was the promise ever that the word would manifest and there not be the spirit there to brood out over it no no any spirit that would try to take away a gift from the bride that doesn't want Rebecca to be outfitted and adorned in all the gifts just wants to delay her departure well come on just wants to keep her in the tent a little longer and it's family it's family stay in the tent a little longer please she's of age just ask her they're finally called out enough that's like hey isn't this a stall tactic I mean look at the goods I mean looks pretty legit this guy must have what he's talking about I mean what does this messenger do is there not a gift that he didn't deliver to the bride which promise did he say didn't qualify I don't know if any place he said speaking of tongues shouldn't be there you know what's interesting is somehow because he cried out against that religious spirit that would take the gifts and use it as a justification for sinful living has been used to take away a righteous life from partaking in the fruits but Lord let the fruits of righteousness first and foremost father but if you want to Adorn it with gifts so there's fruits that could edify Lord then Grant the fruit fruits father I got to read this 61 because the Lord hath anointed me to preach the Good Tidings to the meek he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted proclaim the Liberty to the captives to open up the prisons to them which are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord hallelujah hallu no Hallelujah we got an open book amen what is there there's a judgment there's a pruning there's a purging and the day of Vengeance of our God there's a Vengeance to comfort all that warn to point point unto them that in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called the Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified what's this bride tree declaring his righteousness what is this message done it's the very heartbeat of God the very anointing the the very Vine the very the place we're abiding there'll be fruit produced the seed has to bring forth of its kind but it's a seed in its season in the channel it it in the time I I really just trust the Lord's blessed you in these things let's go ahead and just stand together musicians would come the testimonies of the Lord are true they're righteous alog together and his word cannot return void the very promise that we would be fruitful was one that was given while we were in the image of God as born and again Sons and Daughters of God were found now in that image and the Commandment is that we would be fruitful and we want our fruit to abound right that means there's sometimes purging it means there's pruning it means we have to be patient and let those things have their their work let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we want to thank you Lord for the word that you've given us lord lord it's life to us Lord our confidence is that you are the one who SED the seed Lord and you had an intent you predestinated the ground that would fall upon Lord and you're a good husbandman you look out after that seed Lord and you're an expect an expectancy of what that seed's going to produce Lord you're as a a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber Lord ready to run a race Lord as the sun would come up who could stop it Lord who can keep you from taking this bride to yourself Lord we want to be declaring your image father I we stand in the hour Lord where we've received a word and Lord we want to let it perform all that it's been sent to do Lord if there's any sick here father we know that the very ministering of your word Lord brings healing brings Deliverance Lord you promise that things would be pushed away by the preaching of your word Lord and that we could stand in your presence Lord and I ask that each one being aware that you're here their faith would rise up Lord as your children and claim every promise Lord we just commit it to you we love you father we give you the glory and the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray let's sing this I was a w i remember who I was that was me I was lost I was blind I was running out oh [Music] Hallelujah separated the bridge was far too wide From The Far Side of the C you H me in your made a way across the grave heav to build and there at the cross you P the de I

the Lamb thank you Jesus for the blood is it a than thank you Jesus you have w me wide than you Jesus you have save my life brought me from the darkness glor now you think about it the bride can sing songs with a greater Revelation there's just the anointing that we can enter into understanding the death the spiritual darkness that we've been delivered from the Egypt that we were in this is the greatest love story the day we're living in all long to see it amen you as the bride should be able to enter in and give him the the love that's do him you need to be able to open your heart to him and say thank you Jesus you brought me life this message brought me life amen I would be lost without it you you carved away so many things I'd be entangled with so many cares but you cut them away there's many people living a hybrid life got just enough religion to make him miserable got a gospel that allows them to go to church on Sunday watch their ball game there's no righteousness they go and they enter into an anointing and praise the Lord and the spirit of God and his goodness moves there's no life they're dead in sin and don't know it there's one day their nakedness is going to be exposed but what about us can we say thank you Jesus don't let their false feast spoil your praise they're mimicking you they're mimicking the the praise you can give they want to do it they can't there's only one provided place of worship that's in Jesus Christ they they think they have a right to worship and in vain they do it they're even sometimes lifting up an a false image and Satan's receiving worship as though he's [Music] God there's got to be an anointing where the bride is rejoicing that the bridegroom has come forth to take a bride it's the marriage of the Lamb has come you don't look if you see a sad bride there's something wrong you would want to stop the wedding there would be something and you say whoa whoa whoa hold up is this an abusive relationship why is she sad that she's married was this an arranged marriage what's going on but what has the bride in this day been betrothed with a spoken word word that called you predestinated that said that you were the very heartbeat in tent of God everything all the way through the Old Testament was shadowing a gentile bride and we can look back with this message and see it it a calling out just as Moses took a called a people out of Egypt we've received a message that's called us out of denominationalism let's s that song Egypt I would turn the service over to brother Billy sorry that's I guess one of the

one like him it's the beginning and is the ending I like that let there be in there was amen what he promised will come in the end time it will come to pass you know it's man who's in the habit of uh trying to manufacture they they don't have the patience to just wait for God to bring his promise they will they will hear the word and they will either try to bring something that's in the past or trying to to step away before God oh like our brother said if they only waited on God oh I tell you it's the same thing tonight if we could only wait on God he will bring the promise according to his word he will bring the fruits according to his word the bride the fruits of the Bride in the end time is to manifest the entire word of God is for her to show up and to manifest the maturity that was promised in the end time she doesn't need to go and wonder what's happening how come it's not happening like our brother said he said when the pl when the seed was planted all the master when the when the workers come and said do you want us to take this out want don't worry about it I know what I planted I know what it's going to produce let it grow together the other may seem like it's making a lot of noise it's got a lot of gift just let it wait just wait at the appropriate time at the moment time in the time in the season of life it will bring forth life and that's what we have confidence in the word we have received will bring forth the fruits in the season of God hallelujah hallelujah why because the one who planted it he's the one who's Waring it he's the one who's taking he the one who pruning it why he's wanting it to bring something special something that never been before that's where we are hallelujah hallelujah isn't it good to be in the house of God I feel like we could just go on and you you know just continue hallelujah amen brother Tim Sal if could just come in this Miss amen I don't think it'd be hard for brother Billy to continue he's inspired to preach up here amen the best thing about it is on that tree of life every Branch will be bearing fruit yeah amen amen cuz those that wouldn't bear fruit have already been cut off and the ones that were so so they've been purged and they're bringing forth fruit so there won't be any without fruits so check your lives amen the psalmist David said this is the day yes this is the day the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it the Lord that's the way it reads my Amplified version is I'm determined to rejoice and be glad man let's bow our heads our gracious and kind Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
