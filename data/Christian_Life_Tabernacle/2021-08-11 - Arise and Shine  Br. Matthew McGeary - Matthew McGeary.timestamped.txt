[49:44] midst lord
[49:46] we don't want to unrecognize your
[49:48] presence lord
[49:50] may we have a sobriety about us
[49:53] an approach a reverence
[49:55] an expectation that shows that there's
[49:58] someone here that's in control
[50:00] there's someone here that deserves glory

[50:20] bread of life as only you can
[50:22] we pray these blessings
[50:25] these praises in the most precious name
[50:27] the lord jesus christ amen
[50:30] amen hallelujah
[50:33] why don't we just go ahead and turn in
[50:34] our bibles to isaiah 59.
[50:40] man there's just such a wonderful
[50:42] presence here in the house of god
[50:46] i believe god is pleased to be here
[50:56] and now we just welcome all of our
[50:57] visitors that are here with us it's good
[50:59] to
[51:00] see each one of you
[51:02] amen pray god would be your portion
[51:04] reading out of isaiah chapter 59 i want
[51:06] to read verses 19 to 21
[51:11] and it says so shall they fear the name
[51:12] of the lord
[51:14] from the west
[51:16] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[51:20] so just make notice of that how he says
[51:22] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[51:23] from the west
[51:25] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[51:29] when the enemy shall come in like a
[51:31] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[51:33] up a standard against him
[51:37] and the redeemer shall come to zion
[51:40] and unto them that turn from the
[51:42] transgression in jacob saith the lord
[51:46] as for me this is my covenant with them
[51:48] saith the lord my spirit that is upon
[51:51] thee
[51:52] and my word which i have put in thy
[51:54] mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth
[51:57] nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out
[52:00] of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith
[52:02] the lord from henceforth and forever
[52:06] amen we ask a blessing on the word you
[52:07] may be seated
[52:10] just
[52:11] maybe wanting to in the outset just
[52:14] bring your attention here to this uh
[52:18] verse here in 19 it says so shall they
[52:20] fear the name of the lord from the west
[52:24] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[52:27] so maybe if we could just crystallize
[52:28] our thinking or put our spiritual
[52:30] thinking caps on we want to see how this
[52:33] word applies to the day that we're
[52:35] living in
[52:36] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[52:38] from the west and his glory from the
[52:40] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[52:42] come in like a flood
[52:44] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[52:46] standard against him
[52:49] and we can actually even see the
[52:50] progression here he says and then the
[52:52] redeemer shall come to zion now we know
[52:55] that zion is a type of the bride and
[52:58] then the next portion as the scripture
[53:00] unfold and then he turns to the jews
[53:03] because he's going to deal with the
[53:04] transgression and jacob which what is a
[53:07] transgression it's to go against and so
[53:10] this was the transgression was is that
[53:12] they rejected the messiah and so we can
[53:15] see even in this scripture here a type
[53:17] of the last days unfolding and the
[53:19] brother branham would say this he would
[53:21] say now the gentile church has come to
[53:23] their time
[53:24] and now we're looking for a messiah and
[53:27] if that's the way he acted before that
[53:29] in that day
[53:30] he has to act the same today now brother
[53:33] branham has just taken time to talk
[53:35] about abraham and sarah and talking
[53:37] about how he called him and he gave him
[53:39] his word but before the promised son was
[53:42] to arise on the scene god had appeared
[53:45] in flesh
[53:47] right god had come as melchizedek as you
[53:50] would dramatize that there was god there
[53:52] and he said come on gabriel come on
[53:54] michael we're going down to visit
[53:56] abraham and he he took some potash and
[53:59] he took some and blew some earth
[54:01] together and he stepped right into that
[54:03] body and he came there to visit abraham
[54:07] in the form of a man it was none other
[54:09] than god
[54:11] veiling himself in flesh
[54:13] to abraham and sarah before the arrival
[54:16] of the promised son isaac and now the
[54:19] prophet of god is saying if he acted
[54:21] that way in that day then he has to act
[54:24] the same way now
[54:25] if he lets us go on with with without it
[54:28] then he isn't the same
[54:30] and then he doesn't act the same and
[54:32] he's a respect of persons oh i'm so glad
[54:35] he's not a respecter of person because
[54:37] if there was anybody in this room that
[54:39] doesn't deserve any respect well i would
[54:41] say i'm the first one if you only knew
[54:43] where i've been and what i've done oh my
[54:46] if we went down there i'm telling you
[54:47] friends you wouldn't talk to me you
[54:49] wouldn't want to have anything to do
[54:51] with me my you would just think how
[54:53] could that guy right there be in the
[54:55] midst in this room with all of these
[54:57] people oh thank god for the grace of god
[55:00] thanks for his blood that can reach down
[55:02] into the lowest hell he can reach down
[55:05] into the myrik clay and i'm so thankful
[55:07] for that that our god practices what he
[55:10] preaches because he is no respecter of
[55:12] persian because if you were doing a
[55:14] lineup she who you wanted to serve god
[55:16] in the end time you'd patch right on by
[55:18] me you wouldn't say he gots it this
[55:20] guy's good this this guy knows how to
[55:22] study this guy knows how to remember the
[55:24] word right he knows how to archicate
[55:27] everything together no sir i'm an
[55:29] uneducated man i'm the least of all of
[55:31] you but thanks god that he's not a
[55:33] respecter of person he saw fit to look
[55:36] upon me in the time of my need it was
[55:38] grace oh if anybody in here can say
[55:40] grace grace marvelous grace it's me
[55:43] thank god he's not a respecter of
[55:45] persons
[55:46] he's a respecter of persons but he's not
[55:49] he says see what i mean he's got to do
[55:51] the same thing again so that makes jesus
[55:53] christ the same yesterday today and
[55:56] forever he says now civilization has
[55:58] traveled with the sun now just no notice
[56:01] our opening text here it says
[56:03] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[56:05] from the west and is going from the
[56:07] rising of the sun it says
[56:09] civilization has traveled with the sun
[56:12] we all know that oldest civilization is
[56:14] china
[56:15] and as civilization comes sin heaps up
[56:19] keeps heaping
[56:21] and now it hit the west coast
[56:23] there's a sound barrier or an iron
[56:25] curtain separating the east and the west
[56:28] there's no more people out there in the
[56:30] ocean you go plumb on over till you get
[56:33] back east again
[56:34] and sin has constantly came when the
[56:37] indians lived here and had no sin he had
[56:39] little tribal wars
[56:41] but when the white men had come he
[56:43] brought whiskey women murder and
[56:45] everything else and sin is constantly
[56:47] heaped up
[56:50] and as sin heaps up
[56:53] the bible said when the enemy comes in
[56:56] like a flood now watch the the
[56:58] positioning of this scripture he's not
[57:01] putting this scripture in a day gone by
[57:03] but he's taking the word right now and
[57:06] he's placing it right here in the day in
[57:08] the age that we're living and he says
[57:11] when the bible the bible said when the
[57:13] enemy comes in like a flood god would
[57:16] raise up a standard against it the word
[57:18] of god raise up a standard the word
[57:21] would be more manifested and more
[57:23] manifested so we see that sin has heaped
[57:26] up
[57:27] oh i don't know where you're living but
[57:28] if you're living in the same world that
[57:30] i'm living in sin has heaped up the
[57:32] corruption the moral decay
[57:34] the imagination of man's hearts being
[57:37] continually evil just like it was in the
[57:39] days of noah
[57:43] oh we've seen sin heaped up we're living
[57:45] in the darkest age that man has ever
[57:48] seen but the prophet is showing you how
[57:50] the word here is right in time it's
[57:52] right in season he says the word of god
[57:55] would raise up a standard the word would
[57:57] be meant more manifested and more
[57:59] manifested
[58:01] maybe as we just move a little bit here
[58:03] i just want to read out of spiritual
[58:05] food and due season
[58:07] the prophetess says i want you to get
[58:09] built up now
[58:11] in the holy oracles of god
[58:14] in the faith
[58:17] so i want you to get built up in the
[58:19] word
[58:21] in the faith
[58:24] the faith of this hour
[58:28] he said it's going to take more faith
[58:31] than ever was in any age
[58:34] for this age for this has to be
[58:37] rapturing faith to be taken up
[58:40] and so we want you to believe tonight
[58:43] in all that you have seen
[58:46] heard
[58:47] and the word that you have heard
[58:49] preached the signs and wonders that you
[58:52] have seen done
[58:54] we want you to accumulate
[58:56] all that together in your heart
[58:59] and consider whether
[59:01] if that be of god or not
[59:05] oh my i say god let me accumulate
[59:08] all of the preaching of the word
[59:11] everything that i have seen everything
[59:13] that i have heard lord let me accumulate
[59:16] it all in my heart and oh god as all as
[59:19] i as i accumulate all of that in my
[59:21] heart i say lord i believe
[59:24] it's that word it's that accumulation
[59:26] it's what you've done it's what you have
[59:28] spoken lord that has quickened me to
[59:30] life and i say lord i believe it lord oh
[59:33] let me take all of that word let me
[59:36] accumulate it all together in my heart
[59:38] lord and i'm pondering that word i'm
[59:41] considering that word because it's that
[59:43] word that is producing rapturing faith
[59:49] if there's a faith for the hour
[59:53] not another hour not a day gone by
[59:56] not a glare from another age but there
[59:58] has to be a faith for this hour when sin
[1:00:02] is heaping up when corruption in man is
[1:00:04] the way that it is
[1:00:08] now we have a word that says
[1:00:11] that god would raise up a standard and
[1:00:14] that the word would be more manifested
[1:00:16] and more manifested
[1:00:21] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:00:24] god would raise up the standard against
[1:00:26] it
[1:00:27] the word of god would raise up a
[1:00:28] standard that the word would be more
[1:00:30] manifested and more manifest and i say
[1:00:33] lord i want the word more manifested in
[1:00:34] my life
[1:00:36] i'm not satisfied with where i'm at i'm
[1:00:39] thankful that i'm not where i used to be
[1:00:42] but i am not satisfied with where i'm at
[1:00:44] i'm saying lord i want this word to be
[1:00:47] more manifested in me i'm thankful oh
[1:00:51] god that i've caught the revelation of
[1:00:53] malachi 4 5. i'm so thankful for that
[1:00:56] i'm catching the revelations of
[1:00:58] revelation 17. i i of luke 17. i'm so
[1:01:02] thankful that i've caught the revelation
[1:01:03] of revelations 10 1-7 but oh i don't
[1:01:06] want that to become history as our
[1:01:09] pastor was
[1:01:10] pointing out if we just allow that to be
[1:01:13] rally christ then that just becomes
[1:01:15] denominational fiction
[1:01:18] because if it just becomes a letter it's
[1:01:20] a dead letter but we need the quickening
[1:01:22] power we need the life that's in the
[1:01:24] word to come upon the believer and make
[1:01:26] this word a reality
[1:01:29] and that's why i believe the word that
[1:01:32] i've heard because there was a spirit of
[1:01:34] god that moved upon this flesh
[1:01:37] oh i grew up in the church i grew up in
[1:01:39] the church house i heard my daddy sit
[1:01:42] around and speak with other preachers
[1:01:44] and people would come over and i had a
[1:01:46] knowledge i ran around in the world and
[1:01:48] something in me there was an
[1:01:49] agreeableness that i believe that god
[1:01:51] sent a prophet but did it change my life
[1:01:54] no did it change the way that i acted no
[1:01:59] was i better than anybody else no and i
[1:02:01] still ain't better than anybody else
[1:02:04] but there had to come a time that the
[1:02:06] life that was in the word
[1:02:08] came upon this flesh and quickened the
[1:02:11] seed that was inside of me and then it
[1:02:13] changed me
[1:02:15] then it was manifested in me but no i
[1:02:17] don't sit down and stop right there
[1:02:21] i want more i say lord i want more
[1:02:24] manifest your word in me lord jesus i
[1:02:26] want more
[1:02:29] oh my as i just sat there and pondered
[1:02:32] the service tonight just feeling uh a
[1:02:35] feeble and
[1:02:36] and
[1:02:37] and uh incapable
[1:02:39] i was in prayer and the lord reminded me
[1:02:42] of the scripture
[1:02:43] where david said
[1:02:46] i am young but now i am old but i have
[1:02:48] never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:02:51] and i have never seen them begging bread
[1:02:53] and something in my heart said oh
[1:02:56] that might be for a natural bread but i
[1:02:58] am so thankful that those that hunger
[1:03:00] and thirst after righteousness they
[1:03:03] shall be filled oh i want to say if you
[1:03:06] have a hunger for the word of god oh you
[1:03:08] don't have to come here and not be
[1:03:10] filled oh as insignificant as i might be
[1:03:13] i say your heavenly father is faithful
[1:03:15] and he is just and he's not going to
[1:03:17] forsake you but he'll take the little
[1:03:19] reading of the word he'll take the
[1:03:21] little quote that's read and he'll break
[1:03:23] the bread and he'll feed your soul
[1:03:26] oh if we can just open up our heart to
[1:03:28] let them speak to us and say lord jesus
[1:03:30] i have me speak to me lord god
[1:03:33] oh hallelujah break the bread of life
[1:03:36] lord jesus why we're living in a time
[1:03:38] where there's a spiritual drought
[1:03:42] oh people my they
[1:03:45] it's bad out there
[1:03:48] but we are the most blessed people
[1:03:51] we have spiritual food
[1:03:53] and due season
[1:03:56] when people are out there trying to feed
[1:03:57] out of garbage cans and they're going to
[1:04:00] these uh nonsensical gatherings and
[1:04:04] people calling themselves christians
[1:04:07] oh my to think we have what we have
[1:04:11] but i wonder what are we doing with it
[1:04:14] is it sitting on the shelf is it sitting
[1:04:16] in our phone
[1:04:18] are we listening to it
[1:04:20] i might get on a hobby horse center in a
[1:04:22] little bit but i want to say if you're
[1:04:23] not those of us oh my if you can
[1:04:27] understand english
[1:04:29] i say us english-speaking people we have
[1:04:31] a great responsibility
[1:04:33] that we can hear the prophet's word the
[1:04:36] word of god come through the prophet in
[1:04:38] its purest form that it was given and
[1:04:40] we're not related not through
[1:04:42] translations but all thank god in his
[1:04:44] grace and his mercy he protects his word
[1:04:47] because the very bible that we read it
[1:04:49] wasn't written in english it was written
[1:04:52] in some language that i don't understand
[1:04:54] but god was faithful and just to protect
[1:04:57] that word so don't you let the devil try
[1:04:59] to belittle you or try to feel like you
[1:05:01] haven't gotten the message god has
[1:05:03] protected his word that that spoken word
[1:05:06] would get to your heart so i don't care
[1:05:08] if you speak chinese if you speak french
[1:05:11] if you speak whatever you speak if
[1:05:13] you're a predestinated seed of god his
[1:05:16] word will get there
[1:05:22] some of us just have to work a little
[1:05:24] harder
[1:05:25] and i say i think i think it's just like
[1:05:28] i said maybe be on a hobby horse but i
[1:05:29] think sometimes as american people as
[1:05:32] english believers we're the most
[1:05:33] slothful out of all of them because
[1:05:36] we've had everything just handed it to
[1:05:37] us and we got in our own lane we don't
[1:05:39] even have to fight for it it just sits
[1:05:41] there like we got it like i got the
[1:05:43] message when i know brothers in our
[1:05:46] church and brother billy can even
[1:05:47] testify about it we're brothers and
[1:05:49] sisters would painstakingly take one
[1:05:51] little message take half a book and they
[1:05:53] would write it out so that they could
[1:05:56] have their own copy and they would pass
[1:05:57] it to another brothers and they would
[1:05:59] write it out oh they would cherish that
[1:06:01] message
[1:06:04] oh thank you god for sending a prophet
[1:06:06] thank you god for the evening light and
[1:06:09] they held on to it
[1:06:11] oh but we got it so easy we just put it
[1:06:13] in an electronic box and throw it on the
[1:06:15] table say i wonder what brother
[1:06:16] so-and-so is preaching over there i
[1:06:18] wonder what brother so-and-so is
[1:06:19] preaching over there
[1:06:21] and i wonder if we're listening to other
[1:06:23] other men preach more than we're
[1:06:25] actually listening to the prophet
[1:06:27] if i could be a mouthpiece of god to you
[1:06:29] tonight shame on you
[1:06:34] shame on you
[1:06:36] oh but we need the five-fold ministry to
[1:06:38] break the bread we need the five-fold
[1:06:40] ministry to break the word yes how can
[1:06:43] the five-fold ministry break the word to
[1:06:45] you if you're not feeding on it
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:50] you just want to show up and i don't
[1:06:51] know where we got on this hobby horse
[1:06:53] but we just want to show up and have the
[1:06:55] man of god bless us
[1:06:58] break the word preacher break the word
[1:07:00] pastor i've had a hard week
[1:07:02] but if you're in prayer and you're
[1:07:04] listening to the tape and you're
[1:07:06] listening to the message like it is
[1:07:08] spiritual food in due season and you are
[1:07:10] in a drought
[1:07:12] and you're saying lord thank you lord
[1:07:14] for this daily bread
[1:07:17] feed my hungry soul and you approach it
[1:07:20] in prayer and in reverence and you
[1:07:22] listen to it and you share it and you
[1:07:24] fellowship about it and then you come to
[1:07:26] the house of god
[1:07:29] and then the pastor takes the text and
[1:07:31] then he takes the message and he starts
[1:07:34] to break the word and you're right there
[1:07:36] in the channel with him
[1:07:40] imagine what kind of atmosphere we would
[1:07:42] be in
[1:07:44] oh help us to reverence the word
[1:07:47] help us to have an expectation
[1:07:49] help us to cherish this message that we
[1:07:52] have
[1:07:54] thank you lord for spiritual food and
[1:07:56] due season
[1:07:57] look we have to move
[1:07:59] with the pillar of fire
[1:08:03] we can't keep looking back
[1:08:05] we can't keep thinking we're okay but we
[1:08:08] gotta move with the pillar don't get too
[1:08:10] comfortable
[1:08:12] don't drive your tent stakes down too
[1:08:13] far
[1:08:15] don't worry when that when the god
[1:08:16] starts to move we're so hunkered down
[1:08:18] here we got so many responsibilities and
[1:08:20] so many things done like man i finally
[1:08:22] did a two-tier tent
[1:08:24] uh man i just had that thing all set up
[1:08:26] and i put the little stove in there and
[1:08:27] i had it up there i'm like man we're
[1:08:29] moving again
[1:08:31] i was just getting comfortable here in
[1:08:33] the wilderness
[1:08:34] oh no we we this this the message is
[1:08:37] alive
[1:08:39] the pillar of fire is here the word is
[1:08:42] moving
[1:08:43] it's moving abroad it's it's moving us
[1:08:46] into the translation of our body we're
[1:08:49] moving out of this world we'll come up
[1:08:51] higher and higher oh we're going beyond
[1:08:54] this world into another dimension
[1:08:58] god help us not to get too comfortable
[1:09:01] oh we want to move with the pillar of
[1:09:03] fire
[1:09:05] the prophet of god would say this and
[1:09:07] god keeps his word
[1:09:09] and then along came the pentecostals
[1:09:11] with the restoration of gifts
[1:09:14] and you spoke with tongues and then you
[1:09:15] made a doctrine out of that
[1:09:18] and then what happened your lights gone
[1:09:21] out
[1:09:22] well you think that's do you think
[1:09:23] that's just left for the denominationals
[1:09:26] as soon as as soon as you catch a little
[1:09:29] of the message of god and put a period
[1:09:31] on it and become
[1:09:32] unteachable
[1:09:34] and not being able to be led
[1:09:37] can accept the leadership of god in your
[1:09:39] life
[1:09:39] no pastor can teach you
[1:09:41] when a man of god gets up and preaches
[1:09:43] the word of god and breaks the bread of
[1:09:45] life you're just constantly comparing it
[1:09:47] well you know prophet said okay yeah
[1:09:49] that that lines up with my doctrine i
[1:09:52] want to say you better watch out your
[1:09:53] light has gone out
[1:09:55] all you want to do is debate the message
[1:09:57] all you want to do somebody come out
[1:09:59] i've had to learn this myself and i'm
[1:10:01] still learning this god help me to learn
[1:10:02] and i'll just say it to everybody else
[1:10:04] but every time somebody shares a quote
[1:10:06] we want to finish it or we want to let
[1:10:08] them know we heard it too
[1:10:11] we just want everybody to know we know
[1:10:13] that too
[1:10:16] i remember i corrected a minister one
[1:10:19] time
[1:10:20] because
[1:10:21] i had to do it
[1:10:23] because my my precious friend got done
[1:10:25] uh preaching a message and and and
[1:10:27] instead of just paying the man of god a
[1:10:30] compliment also he could say well i
[1:10:31] remember i preached this this time and i
[1:10:33] did this and i did that and i just
[1:10:35] rebuked him for it
[1:10:37] could you
[1:10:38] i guarantee you the prophet didn't act
[1:10:40] like that
[1:10:43] because if he started you might as well
[1:10:45] be on the road to emmaus
[1:10:47] he'd start at moses
[1:10:50] no
[1:10:50] i mean
[1:10:51] yeah
[1:10:52] we're not all we're not know-it-alls
[1:10:55] we're not all puffed up
[1:10:57] we don't want to be like we know
[1:10:59] everything when everybody somebody wants
[1:11:01] to share the word of god and act like
[1:11:03] we've arrived to that revelation too
[1:11:05] why can't we just say you know that's
[1:11:06] really good
[1:11:08] that's that's that's the truth i believe
[1:11:10] that
[1:11:12] you know what why don't you tell me a
[1:11:13] little bit more
[1:11:15] why won't we foster a little a
[1:11:17] relationship why don't we foster some
[1:11:19] fellowship
[1:11:22] because if we're not careful our light
[1:11:24] just goes out we're just denominational
[1:11:26] thinkers yep check check up i believe
[1:11:28] that too i believe that too i believe
[1:11:29] that too but no the word is alive it's a
[1:11:32] living reality and it's moving a people
[1:11:35] into the promised land we're possessing
[1:11:37] the promised land we're going into a
[1:11:39] rapture
[1:11:41] he says oh your light
[1:11:43] has gone out what's the matter is
[1:11:45] because you failed to stay with the word
[1:11:49] god's words were unfolding
[1:11:52] and we must unfold
[1:11:54] as god's word unfolds
[1:11:58] we must unfold as god's word unfolds as
[1:12:03] time unfolds signs unfolds
[1:12:05] and if the natural world this man is the
[1:12:08] same man he was 6 000 years ago when god
[1:12:11] made him
[1:12:13] he's the same intellectual
[1:12:15] he's the same intelligence
[1:12:17] he's just the same man
[1:12:19] with the same five senses that he was
[1:12:23] thousands of years ago but look what
[1:12:25] progress he's made in the past 50 years
[1:12:29] now remember we're talking about sin
[1:12:30] heaping up
[1:12:34] talking about recognizing our day in its
[1:12:36] message
[1:12:37] seeing the word of god modern events
[1:12:38] made clear by prophecy seeing all this
[1:12:41] now in the day and age that we're living
[1:12:43] in he says look
[1:12:45] what the fallen sons son of god has did
[1:12:49] he's invented automobiles
[1:12:51] and radio and electric lights and atomic
[1:12:54] bombs and jet planes
[1:12:56] look how fast now watch this look how
[1:12:59] fast the pages are turning fast in
[1:13:02] science
[1:13:05] this is 1957 i believe
[1:13:07] look how fast the pages are turning in
[1:13:09] science
[1:13:11] look you can't even go buy a cell phone
[1:13:12] and gift it for a birthday present
[1:13:14] before they release the next model
[1:13:18] science and technology is just at a
[1:13:20] rapid break that pace he says but we are
[1:13:22] trying to linger back on some old church
[1:13:26] creed
[1:13:27] and and stand there
[1:13:29] when god wants to unfold
[1:13:32] the word
[1:13:34] we're living in the last days we're
[1:13:36] living in the time that god's great
[1:13:38] beautiful church ought to be standing on
[1:13:40] its feet
[1:13:41] shining like the lily of nevada that
[1:13:43] valley but we're back somewhere i belong
[1:13:46] to the presbyterian the methodist the
[1:13:48] pentecostal i'm this or that oh what a
[1:13:50] disgrace we should be unfolding
[1:13:54] god's spirit pouring out
[1:13:56] not just one little gusher
[1:13:58] this is where everybody in the church
[1:14:00] house should put up their hands and say
[1:14:02] amen not just one little gusher not one
[1:14:05] little baptism but baptism
[1:14:08] after baptism
[1:14:10] not a revelation just shall live by
[1:14:12] faith or sanctification or gifts of the
[1:14:14] spirit but revelation
[1:14:16] after revelation
[1:14:18] power
[1:14:19] after power
[1:14:21] glory after glory for we ought to be way
[1:14:25] up the road ready for
[1:14:27] oh i say god i want revelation after
[1:14:30] revelation
[1:14:32] power after power and glory after glory
[1:14:35] i said oh god is there a hunger for it
[1:14:38] are you thirsting for it oh if you want
[1:14:41] more revelation the prophet admonishes
[1:14:43] we should pray for more the thing we
[1:14:46] should pray for the most is revelation
[1:14:49] oh he says we should be way up the road
[1:14:51] ready for translation
[1:14:55] oh and then this was in 1957 but i like
[1:14:58] how the prophet of god would say an
[1:15:00] invisible union he would say that we are
[1:15:03] entering into another age
[1:15:06] he said we're entering into the rapture
[1:15:09] age
[1:15:12] but he said the church in its condition
[1:15:15] can't go the way that it is
[1:15:18] but then he said
[1:15:20] it can't go
[1:15:22] the way that it is
[1:15:23] and it's gonna get worse
[1:15:26] well brother matthew you're not putting
[1:15:28] putting much hope out there
[1:15:30] that's why we had to receive a message
[1:15:32] to call us out of the church
[1:15:35] to call us out of the lady ocean
[1:15:38] condition
[1:15:39] there there had to be a message come
[1:15:42] in the evening time when all sin and
[1:15:45] everything was heaped up and we see the
[1:15:47] condition of the age that it was in that
[1:15:49] we would hear the midnight cry
[1:15:52] we would hear the shout the message of
[1:15:54] the hour was calling us out of
[1:15:57] the darkness
[1:15:59] and maybe something that's just on my
[1:16:00] heart tonight i want to encourage you
[1:16:02] because many times we often hear phrases
[1:16:05] like this about it's going to take
[1:16:06] rapturing faith
[1:16:08] and i mean i i don't know if it's just
[1:16:10] going to be as long as we're in this
[1:16:11] sticky stick sticky flesh here but maybe
[1:16:14] we can all work together right now and
[1:16:16] say whenever you hear something like
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:18] claim it
[1:16:20] if it's gonna take rapturing faith that
[1:16:22] means you're a possessor of it
[1:16:25] so many times we hear the word of god
[1:16:28] and we shrink back and we hear rapturing
[1:16:31] faith bride time bright age we hear all
[1:16:33] these things and we start oh my goodness
[1:16:35] it's going to take rapturing faith well
[1:16:36] i don't even know if i could if i'm
[1:16:38] going to make it but you know what if i
[1:16:39] if i've done right you know the the
[1:16:41] prophet said if i've given a bottle of
[1:16:43] water to the elect that i people would
[1:16:45] get on that and i've certainly given a
[1:16:46] lot of water to everybody so i probably
[1:16:48] and all of a sudden god we're god's
[1:16:50] wanting you to move with the pillar of
[1:16:52] fire he's wanting the word to unfold in
[1:16:55] your life he's wanting revelation to
[1:16:57] come after revelation and glory after
[1:16:59] glory and so when he's wanting to take
[1:17:01] us into a higher sphere he needs us to
[1:17:04] believe the word take god at his word
[1:17:07] and say amen that's for me oh if it's
[1:17:10] going to take rapturing faith then i got
[1:17:12] rapturing faith coming
[1:17:15] it's going to take something more than
[1:17:17] we got then lord jesus then what what
[1:17:20] there is more it's coming for me
[1:17:23] oh we need to start being in an
[1:17:25] expectation instead of allowing our
[1:17:27] carnal minds and the devil to keep
[1:17:30] making us shrink back and compare our
[1:17:33] our sinful flesh if you will compare our
[1:17:36] intellectual man to compare our nature
[1:17:38] with the nature of god look in the
[1:17:40] natural sense we could never obtain to
[1:17:43] that supernatural but it's the
[1:17:45] supernatural faith that god has placed
[1:17:48] on the inside of you that believes god
[1:17:50] and takes him at his word and then that
[1:17:52] word materializes itself and your body
[1:17:58] let the word of god unfold in your life
[1:18:04] oh that the prophet said the move is on
[1:18:05] for the bride
[1:18:07] and that's thus saith the lord
[1:18:10] the move is on i said lord i want to
[1:18:11] move with you
[1:18:13] maybe i've i i've allowed myself to get
[1:18:16] a little too complacent maybe i've
[1:18:17] gotten a little too comfortable with my
[1:18:19] revelation i've gotten a little too
[1:18:20] comfortable in church but oh god i want
[1:18:22] to move with the message of the hour
[1:18:25] so i just want to encourage you
[1:18:28] because
[1:18:30] i myself am victim of it where we hear
[1:18:33] such great wonderful words and
[1:18:36] we feel so insignificant and incapable
[1:18:39] but if
[1:18:41] if it's going to take rapturing faith
[1:18:45] let's look at some simple biblical
[1:18:47] principles here in romans 10 17 it says
[1:18:50] so then faith
[1:18:52] cometh by hearing
[1:18:55] and hearing
[1:18:56] by the word of god
[1:18:59] so if there is a faith for the hour
[1:19:03] there has to be a word
[1:19:05] for the hour
[1:19:08] right if it's going to be rapturing
[1:19:11] faith there has to be a rapturing word
[1:19:15] oh hallelujah if the prophet said it's
[1:19:18] going to take rapturing faith that means
[1:19:21] there has to be a rapturing word
[1:19:25] oh what was it there in thessalonians
[1:19:27] behold the lord shall descend with a
[1:19:30] shout
[1:19:31] what was that that was a rapturing
[1:19:35] what is the shout it's the bread of life
[1:19:38] gathering the br the the bride together
[1:19:42] it was the lord descending
[1:19:46] it was the lord coming down with an open
[1:19:48] book what was it it was the rapture
[1:19:51] breaking upon us in the end time
[1:19:54] if it's going to take rapturing faith
[1:19:57] then that means there's a rapturing word
[1:20:01] but we got to be built up in the oracles
[1:20:05] of god we got to unfold with the
[1:20:09] rapturing word
[1:20:12] what what what what was denomination
[1:20:14] always uh their their fallacy always was
[1:20:16] is they would hang their rapture on an
[1:20:18] event
[1:20:21] even uh
[1:20:23] oh i don't know if it was mary or martha
[1:20:25] i forget but even then she said to jesus
[1:20:28] oh lord i know that my brother will rise
[1:20:31] at the resurrection but what did jesus
[1:20:34] tell her
[1:20:35] he said i am the resurrection
[1:20:39] therefore the rapture is not so much of
[1:20:41] an event
[1:20:42] it's a person
[1:20:44] and the person of jesus christ has
[1:20:47] descended with an open book in hand he
[1:20:50] put one foot on the land one feet on the
[1:20:52] sea and he broke the seven seals
[1:20:55] calling your name calling you into a
[1:20:58] rapture
[1:21:00] oh
[1:21:01] hallelujah
[1:21:03] oh we are the most blessed people to be
[1:21:06] able to see these things
[1:21:09] oh the whole christian world is looking
[1:21:11] for a rapture to come
[1:21:13] and the bride of jesus christ is living
[1:21:16] in the rapture
[1:21:18] oh brother matthew you've gone too far
[1:21:20] now
[1:21:22] no sir
[1:21:24] because if you miss malachi 4 5
[1:21:27] if you miss revelations 10 1-7 you will
[1:21:31] miss the rapture
[1:21:34] oh he said if you got the holy ghost
[1:21:36] it's the earnest well one thing i know
[1:21:38] if i've received the message and i got
[1:21:41] the holy ghost it's the earnest of the
[1:21:43] rapture
[1:21:44] so i'm going to let that word just keep
[1:21:46] unfolding in me
[1:21:48] one step at a time
[1:21:50] maybe this step is going to be raptured
[1:21:52] maybe this step is going to be rapture
[1:21:54] maybe this step's going to be raptured
[1:21:56] or this step we got to start living like
[1:21:59] we're walking in a rapture
[1:22:02] oh thank you jesus because in a moment
[1:22:05] in a twinkling of an eye one of these
[1:22:07] days i'm going to take my last step on
[1:22:10] this side of this dimension
[1:22:13] oh god help us to live like it
[1:22:16] help us to act like it
[1:22:20] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:22:22] the word of god
[1:22:28] if there's a faith for the hour
[1:22:32] if there's a condition of the age
[1:22:35] then there has to be something to meet
[1:22:38] the condition of the age
[1:22:40] there has to be something to meet the
[1:22:41] challenge of the age
[1:22:43] why when we look into the scripture
[1:22:45] there in second timothy 3 it says oh
[1:22:48] this i also that this know also that in
[1:22:51] the last days
[1:22:53] perilous times shall come for men shall
[1:22:55] be lovers of their own cells covetous
[1:22:57] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:23:00] to parents
[1:23:02] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:23:04] affection truce breakers false accusers
[1:23:06] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[1:23:08] that are good
[1:23:10] i mean you're despised for just wanting
[1:23:12] to go in the bathroom that's properly
[1:23:13] labeled for you now
[1:23:15] i'm sorry i'm normal
[1:23:19] traders heady high-minded lovers of
[1:23:21] pleasure more than lovers of god having
[1:23:23] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:23:25] power thereof
[1:23:27] revelations 3 17 because thou says time
[1:23:29] reach rich and increase with goods and
[1:23:31] have need of nothing and know us not
[1:23:36] that thou art wretched miserable
[1:23:39] poor
[1:23:40] blind and naked
[1:23:43] the world's in darkness
[1:23:45] it's groping in darkness oh a great
[1:23:49] darkness is upon the face of the earth
[1:23:51] and the prophet when he preached shalom
[1:23:54] he would say when reading isaiah 62 it
[1:23:56] says for behold the darkness shall cover
[1:23:58] the earth and gross darkness the people
[1:24:01] the prophet said that's prophesying of
[1:24:03] the day that we are now living in
[1:24:07] and he goes on to talk about just how
[1:24:09] great darkness is upon the face of the
[1:24:11] earth now just like it was in the very
[1:24:14] beginning when god created the heavens
[1:24:16] and the earth but the earth was without
[1:24:18] form and the earth was void great
[1:24:21] darkness was upon the face of the earth
[1:24:24] but god had planted his seed there in
[1:24:26] the earth
[1:24:28] so there had to come a light to bring
[1:24:31] the seed to maturity there had to come a
[1:24:34] light to quicken the seed that was
[1:24:36] laying there in the earth
[1:24:40] light brings life
[1:24:43] no light
[1:24:45] no life
[1:24:46] light brings life
[1:24:48] as we mentioned
[1:24:50] that was me i was dead
[1:24:52] i was in sin i was in trespasses
[1:24:55] but there came a time that the light of
[1:24:57] god's word struck my soul
[1:25:01] and it quickened me to life
[1:25:04] jesus would say in john 12 46 i am come
[1:25:07] alive into the world
[1:25:09] that whosoever believeth on me should
[1:25:11] not abide in darkness
[1:25:16] peter would say but you are a chosen
[1:25:18] generation first peter 2 9-11
[1:25:21] a royal priesthood
[1:25:23] a holy nation of peculiar people that
[1:25:25] you should show forth praises of him who
[1:25:27] have called you out of darkness into his
[1:25:29] marvelous light
[1:25:31] which in times past were not a people
[1:25:34] but are now the people of god oh i'm so
[1:25:36] thankful about it look i want to tell
[1:25:38] any young person in here if even if
[1:25:40] you're young or old
[1:25:42] one of the the tricks of the devil every
[1:25:44] time that you start to consider to give
[1:25:47] your heart to god and make a complete
[1:25:49] surrender there's this nervousness
[1:25:52] of what you're gonna do without the
[1:25:54] things that you've always depended on
[1:25:57] what am i gonna do with my time i spend
[1:26:00] this much time on social media i i have
[1:26:02] these friends over here and all of a
[1:26:05] sudden it'll create an anxiety because
[1:26:07] your whole life has been forged upon
[1:26:10] your five senses your whole life has
[1:26:12] been forged upon the things that can
[1:26:14] contact this earthly home but all of a
[1:26:16] sudden there's a call to your heart that
[1:26:19] says you have to die
[1:26:21] you gotta die to everything you gotta
[1:26:24] die to all of your thinking you gotta
[1:26:26] die out you gotta come to a place of
[1:26:28] total surrender where it means oh god if
[1:26:31] i gotta surrender all of my friends if i
[1:26:33] gotta surrender my education or if i get
[1:26:35] to surrender my job look friends you've
[1:26:38] got to come to the place where you're
[1:26:40] willing to do whatever it takes and die
[1:26:43] out luck stalk and barrel and come to
[1:26:45] jesus and say lord here i am i'm laying
[1:26:49] it all down you at your feet lord god
[1:26:52] if it means i'm going to lose my family
[1:26:55] if it means i'm going to lose my friends
[1:26:57] if it means i'm going to lose my job
[1:26:59] lord whatever it takes lord here i am
[1:27:04] and as soon as that word
[1:27:07] starts
[1:27:09] to deal with your heart and bring you to
[1:27:11] that place
[1:27:12] you you start to get all this anxiety
[1:27:14] and start to wonder what am i going to
[1:27:16] do with my time what am i going to do
[1:27:19] with my social media
[1:27:21] and i remember by the grace of god when
[1:27:24] the the day
[1:27:26] i got converted
[1:27:28] god gave me a best friend the same day i
[1:27:30] got converted
[1:27:33] yes the lord is our best friend but god
[1:27:35] truly gave me
[1:27:36] a body that same day that we've been
[1:27:38] best friends ever since
[1:27:42] i didn't have to
[1:27:44] look back and be like

[1:28:22] over uh a brother a precious brother
[1:28:25] that just started coming to our church
[1:28:27] that was one of the things he wasn't all
[1:28:28] about he's like my y'all just
[1:28:30] received me like i'm family i said
[1:28:32] brother you are family
[1:28:34] and the lord was dealing with his heart
[1:28:35] maybe to move away for a little bit and
[1:28:37] that was he was kind of uh you know uh
[1:28:40] uh wondering about that he's like well i
[1:28:41] just don't know if you know when i go
[1:28:43] over there if it's going to be the same
[1:28:44] it's like it's going to be the same
[1:28:46] go on over there and find out oh when
[1:28:48] you meet the family of god when you meet
[1:28:51] the bride of jesus christ it's not them
[1:28:53] it's christ in them that welcomes you
[1:28:55] with open arms
[1:28:57] he says which in times past we're not a
[1:28:58] people but now
[1:29:00] the people of god i'm so thankful to be
[1:29:02] a part of the family of god
[1:29:05] which have not obtained mercy but now
[1:29:07] have obtained mercy
[1:29:10] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[1:29:11] strangers and pilgrims abstained from
[1:29:13] freshly lust
[1:29:15] which war against the soul
[1:29:17] i don't want to belabor this point too
[1:29:19] much
[1:29:20] but he says here
[1:29:23] abstain from fleshly lust which war
[1:29:27] against the soul
[1:29:32] he says i beseech you as strangers and
[1:29:34] pilgrims look you're not from here
[1:29:39] this world is not your home
[1:29:42] so there needs to be an accountability
[1:29:44] and a power in our lives where we're not
[1:29:46] entertaining the things of the world
[1:29:49] that we're abstaining from the the the
[1:29:52] lushly flesh the the lust of the flesh
[1:29:54] and not getting tangled up in those
[1:29:56] things
[1:29:57] because we're not from here
[1:30:00] we're from above but he says those
[1:30:02] things war against your soul
[1:30:06] now i know we've spent time on this
[1:30:07] before but it's not always it's things
[1:30:10] that are lawful that can war against
[1:30:12] your soul
[1:30:13] it's things that are taking away your
[1:30:14] time it might be lawful you know as i
[1:30:17] was thinking about this they war against
[1:30:19] the soul when you look into the
[1:30:20] scriptures
[1:30:22] when david was found in sin with
[1:30:24] bathsheba
[1:30:25] the scripture says it was at a time when
[1:30:28] kings go to war
[1:30:30] he sent job out and they i believe they
[1:30:32] killed the the amorites or the ammonites
[1:30:36] it says but david carried still in
[1:30:39] jerusalem
[1:30:41] it was at a time when kings went to war
[1:30:44] we're in a warfare church
[1:30:46] we're doing spiritual warfare but david
[1:30:49] at a time when kings go to war he stayed
[1:30:52] back maybe he got a little complacent
[1:30:55] and it was there in that maybe
[1:30:56] slawfulness or a time when kings would
[1:30:59] go to battle he wasn't acting like he
[1:31:01] was in war he wasn't acting like he was
[1:31:04] in battle
[1:31:05] he was out there on his porch
[1:31:08] surveying the land
[1:31:10] when the lust of his eye got hooked in
[1:31:14] them that was his downfall of time
[1:31:18] when kings go to war
[1:31:20] oh if he would have been about the
[1:31:22] father's business if he would have been
[1:31:23] living according to the time when kings
[1:31:25] go to war and often that's how we always
[1:31:28] get ourselves in trouble we forget that
[1:31:30] we're in a warfare it's those little
[1:31:32] things that you're allowing to do that
[1:31:34] are warring against your soul
[1:31:37] oh and i love that story
[1:31:39] because there david he gets himself in
[1:31:40] trouble you know what he wants to do he
[1:31:42] wants to cover up his mistake
[1:31:45] so he tells your eye hey you're right
[1:31:46] come on back home uh you know how's the
[1:31:48] war going
[1:31:50] you know how's everything going why why
[1:31:51] don't you eat a little bit you know oh i
[1:31:53] just i just i want to see how the war is
[1:31:55] going so he's updating he goes why why
[1:31:57] don't you go home
[1:31:59] why don't you go home and spend the
[1:32:01] evening with your wife and then we'll
[1:32:02] send you back out to the war
[1:32:04] and uriah
[1:32:06] you know there's only about three or
[1:32:07] four people that brother branham says
[1:32:08] that i want to shake their hand when i
[1:32:10] get on the other side
[1:32:11] and the prophet said when i get to
[1:32:13] heaven i want to shake your eyes hand
[1:32:15] because he looked at the king and said
[1:32:18] not soul my lord
[1:32:20] my lord joab's out there in battle
[1:32:23] the ark of god is out there in the
[1:32:25] battlefield
[1:32:27] far be it for me to go to the comfort of
[1:32:30] my own home
[1:32:32] while the people of god and the ark of
[1:32:34] god are out there on the battlefield
[1:32:39] and he laid there at the gate and slept
[1:32:44] i say oh god help me
[1:32:47] not to be slothful lord
[1:32:49] help me not to be slack it's it's things
[1:32:52] that might be lawful
[1:32:54] that we stay back that start to war
[1:32:56] against our soul and hear a man
[1:32:59] called on by his king and bidden
[1:33:02] to go to the comforts of his own home
[1:33:04] wouldn't even go take a break because
[1:33:06] his brothers were out there on the
[1:33:08] battlefield with the ark of god i said
[1:33:10] god help us to be vigilant help us to be
[1:33:13] sober minded help us to realize that
[1:33:16] we're in spiritual warfare
[1:33:21] colossians 3 2 says set your affections
[1:33:23] on things above and not on the things of
[1:33:25] the earth
[1:33:31] proverbs would say this
[1:33:34] in verse 30. say i went by the field of
[1:33:37] the slothful
[1:33:39] and by the vineyard of the man void of
[1:33:42] understanding
[1:33:43] although it was all grown over and the
[1:33:45] thorns and the nettles covered the face
[1:33:47] thereof and the stone wall thereof was
[1:33:49] broken down
[1:33:50] then i saw and considered it well and i
[1:33:52] looked upon it and received instruction
[1:33:55] yet a little sleep
[1:33:56] a little slumber
[1:33:58] a little folding of the hands to sleep
[1:34:01] you know that reminded me of the
[1:34:02] sleeping virgin
[1:34:05] oh the lord tarries this coming
[1:34:08] i wonder if we're getting lulled to
[1:34:10] sleep
[1:34:11] i wonder if we feel like all the lord's
[1:34:13] tarried is coming
[1:34:15] i as i thought about this i i reminded
[1:34:18] of my own parents
[1:34:20] who when they listened to choosing of a
[1:34:22] bride
[1:34:23] they left everything they knew
[1:34:26] they grew up in san diego california
[1:34:29] but when they heard the word of the lord
[1:34:31] say
[1:34:32] oh city of los angeles
[1:34:35] and say it was going to be sunk they
[1:34:37] went and packed up all of their things
[1:34:39] and they got out of there
[1:34:42] that was some over 50 years ago
[1:34:45] you think they were going to find out
[1:34:47] what the next uh uh uh uh uh you know
[1:34:50] the the the new uh and improved
[1:34:53] electronic was
[1:34:55] you know they're going out my what
[1:34:56] better laptop can i get there was
[1:34:58] nothing
[1:35:00] else on their mind but leaving
[1:35:04] they were probably giving things away
[1:35:07] they were probably like we can't take it
[1:35:08] all with us they just wanted to get
[1:35:11] lighter to make their trip easier
[1:35:13] and i say family of god we need to have
[1:35:15] the science mindset
[1:35:17] where we're trying to get lighter
[1:35:19] because it's going home time
[1:35:22] we'll just try to move down the home
[1:35:23] stretch here really quick
[1:35:26] oh it's it's lamp trimming time church
[1:35:29] our la our lamps need to be burning
[1:35:31] bright and clear
[1:35:33] the prophet of god would say this and
[1:35:35] there's a man that can turn on the light
[1:35:37] he's
[1:35:38] speaking about the seed he says plant
[1:35:40] the weed out here so we're speaking
[1:35:41] about light the evening time light
[1:35:43] uh the rising of the sun he says plant
[1:35:46] the wheat out there and put it in a
[1:35:47] basement cover it all over it'll never
[1:35:49] bring forth anything because it can't
[1:35:52] there's no light there but as soon as
[1:35:54] light strikes it then it'll bring forth
[1:35:57] life
[1:35:58] if it's a germatized seed that's the
[1:36:00] same thing that's in the word see the
[1:36:02] word is god and when the light strikes
[1:36:04] it it brings the word to life again
[1:36:08] every age has always been that way so
[1:36:11] just stay with me for about 10 minutes
[1:36:12] and we'll close every age has had its
[1:36:14] message
[1:36:15] and every age has had a predestinated
[1:36:18] people there to receive it
[1:36:20] just as joshua and caleb received the
[1:36:22] message from the prophet moses that they
[1:36:25] would possess the promised land the
[1:36:27] prophet of god said the old crop all of
[1:36:30] them that doubted that word all of them
[1:36:32] that said we can't take it there's no
[1:36:34] way we could take it all of them died
[1:36:37] out because they didn't believe that
[1:36:39] word but there was two
[1:36:41] predestinated seed that were there to
[1:36:44] receive the message that moses took and
[1:36:48] it was those two believers that god used
[1:36:51] to fulfill the prophet's message
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] so i want to use it as we close out this
[1:36:57] thought here just with that in your mind
[1:36:59] and proving his word the prophet says
[1:37:01] now i want you to notice
[1:37:03] he does it that way in every age so he
[1:37:04] just spoke about joshua and caleb using
[1:37:07] believers that believed the message to
[1:37:09] go into the promised land he says he
[1:37:11] does it that way in every age he does it
[1:37:13] every time by the same method
[1:37:15] he has to take believers
[1:37:19] oh my
[1:37:21] look friends
[1:37:22] all of these glorious promises about a
[1:37:24] body change all of these glorious
[1:37:26] promises about a rapture all of the
[1:37:29] glorious promises in the word of god
[1:37:31] he has to take believers oh god i let it
[1:37:35] be me lord
[1:37:36] i i i here i am lord jesus and then in
[1:37:40] order to have believers meet that word
[1:37:42] he's got to predestinate it to that age
[1:37:46] you see it he's got to predestinate this
[1:37:49] thing to be there to meet the challenge
[1:37:51] of the age did you get it
[1:37:53] did you feel it
[1:37:55] did you see it do you understand that's
[1:37:58] what's happening today
[1:38:00] he's predestinated to this
[1:38:03] by his foreknowledge when he
[1:38:04] predestinated in malachi 4 it's going to
[1:38:08] happen
[1:38:09] and if he predestinated malachi 4 and it
[1:38:11] was going to happen and behold i sent
[1:38:13] you elijah you are the you that's been
[1:38:16] predestinated
[1:38:18] to receive the message
[1:38:21] now as we just close on this going back
[1:38:23] to our text now
[1:38:26] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:38:29] from the west
[1:38:31] and his glory from the rising of the son
[1:38:35] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:38:36] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[1:38:38] up a standard against him
[1:38:42] oh my i was thinking about this
[1:38:45] oh dry bones
[1:38:48] hear ye the word of the lord
[1:38:51] how can dry bones here
[1:38:56] oh dry bones hear ye the word of the
[1:38:59] lord
[1:39:02] the only way they could hear the word is
[1:39:05] if those bones were predestined to hear
[1:39:07] that word
[1:39:09] it's not what the dry bones did
[1:39:12] the dry bones were just laying there in
[1:39:14] the valley and darkness
[1:39:17] but it said the god said to the prophet
[1:39:19] can these dry bones live he said thou
[1:39:22] knowest he said prophesy
[1:39:25] and then when he prophesied and said oh
[1:39:28] dry bones hear ye the word of the lord
[1:39:31] when god said
[1:39:32] that malachi 4 would sound in the last
[1:39:36] days he had to predestinate somebody to
[1:39:40] be here to receive the message because
[1:39:43] god only uses believers
[1:39:46] you were predestined to hear it
[1:39:49] oh thank you god it's not what the bones
[1:39:52] did it's what the word of the lord did
[1:39:54] it's not what you did it's what god did
[1:39:57] it's what malachi 4 5 did it's what the
[1:40:00] mighty angel did when he came down and
[1:40:03] called your name
[1:40:05] oh thank you jesus behold i send you
[1:40:08] elijah so you are predestinated to be
[1:40:12] here to receive the message of elijah
[1:40:15] now watch this in our text oh this is
[1:40:16] beautiful
[1:40:18] the next verse
[1:40:20] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:40:21] standard against him
[1:40:24] and the redeemer
[1:40:26] shall come
[1:40:27] to zion
[1:40:30] now many times we stop there when we
[1:40:31] read
[1:40:34] isaiah 59
[1:40:37] and just because there's a break to
[1:40:38] another chapter
[1:40:41] we stop there
[1:40:43] but i just want to read this now in
[1:40:44] closing if the musicians would come
[1:40:47] but if i can have your attention for
[1:40:48] this
[1:40:50] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[1:40:52] from the west
[1:40:53] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[1:40:56] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:40:58] flood the spirit of the lord shall lift
[1:41:00] up a standard against him
[1:41:02] and the redeemer shall come to zion and
[1:41:05] unto them that turn from the
[1:41:06] transgression and jacob saith the lord
[1:41:09] as for me this is my covenant with them
[1:41:11] saith the lord my spirit that is upon
[1:41:13] thee and my words which i put in my
[1:41:15] mouth shall not depart
[1:41:17] out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of
[1:41:19] thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy
[1:41:20] seed seeds saith the lord from
[1:41:22] henceforth and forever
[1:41:24] arise
[1:41:26] and shine
[1:41:28] for thy light is come
[1:41:31] and the glory
[1:41:32] of the lord is risen upon thee
[1:41:35] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:41:37] earth and gross darkness the people
[1:41:41] but the lord shall rise upon thee and
[1:41:43] his glory shall be seen upon thee now
[1:41:47] when brother branham preaches shalom he
[1:41:49] says look
[1:41:50] look in this same promise right here
[1:41:53] he says you have light
[1:41:56] and you have darkness the prophet said
[1:41:58] he's come to a spot that he believes the
[1:42:00] people don't even know what they're
[1:42:01] doing it comes to a time where the human
[1:42:03] being has to look like become such a
[1:42:05] subject to evil it's a pathetic thing it
[1:42:08] seems like there's a shadow of darkness
[1:42:10] just covering over the people and
[1:42:12] pressing them oh my if we're ever seeing
[1:42:16] a shadow of darkness over the people but
[1:42:18] he said it's just like in the beginning
[1:42:20] when the light
[1:42:22] separated the light from the darkness
[1:42:24] the darkness is all heaped up to one
[1:42:26] side oh but arise and shine thy light
[1:42:30] has come he said look you have all the
[1:42:31] darkness
[1:42:33] you have all the light the light which
[1:42:36] sets perfectly zechariah 14 6
[1:42:40] and it shall come to pass in that day
[1:42:43] that light shall not be that the light
[1:42:45] shall not be clear nor dark
[1:42:47] but it shall be as one day which shall
[1:42:49] be known unto the lord
[1:42:51] not day nor night but it shall come to
[1:42:54] pass
[1:42:55] that at the evening times
[1:42:57] it shall be light oh when the eve
[1:43:01] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:43:04] oh the spirit of god will raise up
[1:43:07] a standard
[1:43:10] the spirit of god would raise up the
[1:43:12] word
[1:43:13] and the word himself has risen upon you
[1:43:18] arise thy light has come it is the
[1:43:20] rising of the sun
[1:43:22] oh praise the lord let's stand
[1:43:30] oh the prophet said shalom
[1:43:33] peace
[1:43:35] don't be weary
[1:43:37] jesus is here
[1:43:39] his great light has come to us
[1:43:42] and we're so thankful for it

[1:44:04] why doesn't everybody just pray in their
[1:44:06] own way
[1:44:08] thank god for the message
[1:44:11] oh when the enemy would come in like a
[1:44:12] flood
[1:44:14] he didn't leave it to chance
[1:44:17] he didn't leave you on your own but he
[1:44:19] said i'll be with you
[1:44:21] even in you until the end
[1:44:25] god has come down himself
[1:44:28] when there is such great darkness upon
[1:44:30] the face of the earth arise and shine
[1:44:33] for thy light has come it is the rising
[1:44:36] of the sun this day this scripture is
[1:44:39] fulfilled

[2:00:37] lord he put confidence in the man that
[2:00:39] comes behind here lord and as he said
[2:00:41] it's not into his flesh lord but it's
[2:00:43] that the word that is spoken over here
[2:00:45] we know the word is changing us lord and
[2:00:48] or we know that you've given us faith in

[2:01:20] life and effect on someone that could
[2:01:22] change them

[2:01:32] you sent someone by with the word of
[2:01:34] encouragement lord a book was passed our
[2:01:36] way a message was given to us lord and
[2:01:39] it anointed that spirit and that seed
[2:01:41] within us lord
