[17:27] ground
[17:29] good morning let's go ahead and bow our
[17:32] heads commit the service to the Lord
[17:34] this morning Heavenly
[17:36] Father Lord we're so grateful to you for
[17:38] all things Lord Lord for your keeping
[17:41] hand upon our lives and Lord the fact
[17:44] that we have the health and strength to
[17:46] be able to come to your service this
[17:48] morning Lord to hear of you Lord we have
[17:51] so many things to be thankful of Lord
[17:54] and for your hand in our lives we want
[17:56] to be careful to commit the service to
[17:57] you this morning morning Lord we've want
[18:01] to dedicate this to you Lord not coming
[18:03] with any program of our own or Lord any
[18:07] schedule or agenda or order of events or
[18:11] human expectations but Lord the only
[18:13] expectation we want to have is that
[18:16] you'll fulfill your word that you'll
[18:17] meet us here if we come together in your
[18:20] name so we commit the service to you
[18:23] Lord asking that you'd meet us Lord we
[18:25] want to make you welcome in this place
[18:28] Lord we pray that you'd have your
[18:29] perfect will to move among your people
[18:32] to speak your word to meet every need
[18:34] and to draw us ever closer to you we
[18:36] pray these things in Jesus name amen you
[18:40] may be seated just a few
[18:42] minutes we're going
[18:44] to turn to Psalm 95 for a scripture
[18:48] reading this
[18:49] morning and you know there are
[18:53] certainly you know some familiar verses
[18:56] in this chapter as we'll read it this
[18:58] morning and but it's a little bit of a
[19:00] strange Psalm because it starts out in
[19:03] one way and then makes a turn and takes
[19:06] a completely different
[19:08] tone you know it starts out with verse
[19:12] one it says oh come let us sing unto the
[19:14] Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise to the
[19:17] rock of our
[19:19] salvation and you know each verse just a
[19:22] call to praise the Lord and worship Him
[19:24] verse two and verse three and verse four
[19:27] and on down to verse 7 where it says for
[19:31] he is our
[19:33] God and we are the people of his
[19:37] pasture and the Sheep of his
[19:40] hand now
[19:42] notice it doesn't say his
[19:45] sheep it says the Sheep of his
[19:50] pasture and then the Sheep of his
[19:53] hand you know as I thought about that
[19:57] the scriptures from John 10 came to my
[19:59] mind where Jesus said he that entereth
[20:03] in by the door is The Shepherd of the
[20:06] sheep to him the Porter openeth and the
[20:09] sheep hear his
[20:12] voice and he calleth his own Sheep by
[20:17] name and leadth them
[20:20] out and when he putteth forth his own
[20:24] sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep
[20:29] follow him for they know his
[20:34] voice and a stranger will they not
[20:36] follow but will flee from him for they
[20:39] know not the voice of
[20:43] strangers then if we run down to verse
[20:45] 14 he says I am the Good Shepherd and
[20:49] know my sheep and have known of
[20:54] mine you know in Psalm 95 it's speaks of
[20:59] the sheep of his
[21:01] pasture but in John 10 it speaks of his
[21:07] sheep so he has a pasture the pasture is
[21:10] his and there are sheep in it and then
[21:13] there are his sheep the Sheep of his
[21:18] hand you know the
[21:20] difference is is that my sheep hear my
[21:25] voice that's the difference
[21:30] they come when I
[21:34] call so there are sheep in his
[21:37] pasture and then there are his sheep the
[21:40] Sheep of his
[21:42] hand you know I was thinking about that
[21:44] as I was reading Psalm 95:7 where it
[21:47] says we are the Sheep of his pasture and
[21:50] the Sheep of his hand not just one but
[21:56] both Jesus says that this this way
[21:58] there's a distinction made and he says
[21:59] this in John 10:26 he says but you
[22:02] believe not because ye are not of my
[22:07] sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear
[22:11] my
[22:13] voice and I know them and they follow
[22:18] me you know we've all heard the phrase
[22:21] seeing is believing this is hearing is
[22:23] believing if you hear his
[22:26] voice but you notice at as we read Psalm
[22:30] 95 and we get to the end of verse 7 it
[22:33] makes a
[22:35] turn you know it speaks of him being our
[22:37] God and being his
[22:41] sheep but then as we start to get into
[22:43] verse 7 verse 8 it takes a completely
[22:45] different
[22:47] turn it says
[22:49] today if you will hear his
[22:52] voice Harden not your
[22:55] heart as in the provocation
[22:58] and as in the day of Temptation in the
[23:02] wilderness when your fathers tempted me
[23:05] and proved me and saw my
[23:08] work we've already established that my
[23:11] sheep hear my voice they hear his voice
[23:15] but now Psalm 95 says if you will hear
[23:19] his
[23:21] voice Harden not your
[23:24] heart you know if we're careful we're
[23:27] not not careful we read that
[23:30] scripture and that will just attribute
[23:33] that to those who aren't his
[23:35] sheep to those who can't hear his
[23:40] voice but as I was reading this it
[23:42] struck me it's speaking to the sheep
[23:44] that can hear his
[23:47] voice you know as message Believers
[23:49] we're we're well well taught right we we
[23:53] know that he you have to be given an ear
[23:56] to hear and that we' been given an ear
[23:58] to hear when we read the scripture in
[24:00] John 10 that says my sheep know my voice
[24:04] we believe that refers to
[24:07] us but you know Psalm 957 says if you
[24:11] will hear his voice Harden not your
[24:16] heart this is not written to the
[24:18] unbeliever to the sheep that can't hear
[24:21] him but this is written to his sheep
[24:25] those that have a capacity to hear
[24:30] him he's placed within each of us an
[24:33] ability to hear his
[24:36] voice we have the
[24:39] ability but in order to hear his voice
[24:44] each
[24:46] day calling us by name as he says in
[24:49] John
[24:51] 10 we have to take care that our heart
[24:53] isn't
[24:55] hardened that each day it's not too
[24:59] fixed too set on what we're doing that
[25:03] day our circumstances our daily lives
[25:06] the things that are demanding our
[25:09] attention so unmovable so
[25:13] focused that on whatever is in front of
[25:16] us that we miss hearing his voice for
[25:20] that
[25:21] day you know it's
[25:24] interesting how verse 8 in Psalm 95
[25:27] describes this says Harden not your
[25:30] heart as in the
[25:33] provocation as in the day of Temptation
[25:37] in the
[25:37] wilderness that's the
[25:40] example don't be like
[25:42] that but what exactly is
[25:47] that you know the original Hebrew there
[25:50] actually says it this way it says Harden
[25:53] not your
[25:54] heart as in marba
[25:58] and as in Masa in the
[26:02] wilderness and those of you who are
[26:04] Bible students should recognize those
[26:07] names they were names that Moses gave to
[26:10] a place in Exodus
[26:14] 17 if you remember the situation God LED
[26:18] his people to a place called
[26:20] refidim in the wilderness and there was
[26:23] no water to
[26:26] drink and the people the Sheep of his
[26:30] pasture got so
[26:32] focused on their daily
[26:36] needs their daily situations their
[26:40] circumstance for that
[26:42] day their condition they were
[26:45] so determined on F addressing just that
[26:48] thing that was in front of
[26:51] them they became hardened to what God
[26:53] was trying to tell
[26:56] them you know if they had been less
[27:01] hard less fixed on their life their
[27:06] daily life and their daily activities
[27:08] and the things that demanded their time
[27:10] and things that they had to
[27:13] do less focused on those things they
[27:17] would have heard the voice of the Lord
[27:21] you can read it in John or rather in
[27:23] Exodus 1
[27:25] 17:5 they're in that situation and it
[27:28] says and the Lord said unto Moses go on
[27:31] before the people and take with thee of
[27:33] the Elders of Israel and thy rod
[27:36] wherewith thou smortest the river take
[27:39] in thine hand and go behold I will stand
[27:42] before thee there upon the rock in
[27:46] horb and thou shalt Smite The Rock and
[27:49] there shall come water out of it that
[27:51] the people may
[27:54] drink you know that was the voice of the
[27:56] Lord saying go here and you'll have to
[28:01] that smitten Rock and there'll be plenty
[28:03] of water to
[28:06] drink
[28:08] but you know they were so focused on
[28:13] their need that they remain fixed there
[28:16] in Reid and worrying about their
[28:18] water and then in verse eight the enemy
[28:22] snuck up behind them and ambushed them
[28:25] says then came
[28:30] in a battle they wouldn't have had to
[28:33] fight if they weren't so fixed on their
[28:35] daily
[28:37] thing that they were sensitive to the
[28:39] voice of the Lord for that
[28:44] day it says in Exodus 17:7 and he Moses
[28:48] called the name of that place that
[28:51] spot Masa and
[28:55] marba because of the ch in of the
[28:57] children of Israel and because they
[28:59] tempted the Lord saying is the Lord
[29:01] among us or
[29:04] not you know I was reading that and I I
[29:07] got to wondering how many times I'm so
[29:10] focused on my things that I have to do
[29:15] that
[29:16] day the day that's ahead of me the
[29:18] things that's demanded of me the
[29:21] pressures the circumstances the
[29:23] challenges the problems the tasks
[29:25] whatever it is
[29:28] that I become so fixated on those
[29:31] things that I don't hear what he wants
[29:34] to tell me for that day I don't hear his
[29:37] voice now I may play a tape I may rush
[29:41] through a quick prayer I may do all the
[29:43] things but have I heard his voice
[29:47] leading me that day as he called me by
[29:52] name that day and showed me himself you
[29:56] know I wonder how many times we get to
[29:59] the end of the
[30:00] day and we've never really heard from
[30:03] him never been LED from him but instead
[30:06] went immediately to responding those
[30:08] things that daily life requires of
[30:12] us and we get to the end of the day and
[30:16] we talk about the things that we had to
[30:17] address and the things we got done and
[30:20] the where we went and what we did and
[30:22] what we think and never one time can we
[30:24] point back and say the Lord spoke to be
[30:26] here and he led me here and he came on
[30:29] the scene for me
[30:31] here is the Lord among us or
[30:36] not you know I wonder how many times
[30:40] I've allowed my heart to become so
[30:42] fixated so set on what I have in front
[30:45] of me that I failed to hear his voice
[30:48] for that
[30:49] day you know the last thing I want to do
[30:52] is be guilty of these people as it says
[30:54] in numbers 14:22 it says because all
[30:56] these men men which have seen my glory
[31:00] and my
[31:02] Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
[31:04] wilderness and have tempted me that
[31:07] phrase actually means put me to the
[31:09] test these 10 times and have not
[31:12] hearkened or listened to or heard my
[31:17] voice surrounded by examples and
[31:20] Witnesses and testimonies that they knew
[31:22] so
[31:23] well but so busy on Monday or Tuesday
[31:27] whatever the day is focused on that
[31:30] which is in front of us to
[31:31] do that we don't hear from
[31:34] him let's go ahead and stand this
[31:37] morning you know if we don't make a
[31:40] point to hear his voice
[31:42] personally each day to be led by him
[31:47] then the question is is do we get to the
[31:49] end of the day and can we ask is the
[31:50] Lord among us or
[31:54] no and certainly for me it was uh
[31:57] important
[31:59] reminder you know we should be able to
[32:01] look at each day and say the Lord was
[32:03] here the Lord came by my way I heard his
[32:06] voice and he led me in this way or
[32:10] directed me in this way or caused me to
[32:13] pause here or whatever the case may be
[32:16] is the Lord among
[32:17] us or not let's just go ahead and read
[32:21] that this morning my prayer is that the
[32:23] Lord will help us help me not to be so
[32:27] hardened so fixed so set on what the day
[32:30] has ahead of me that I can't hear his
[32:33] voice in case he might want us to pause
[32:36] and walk down this road instead of catch
[32:38] that scheduled flight to
[32:40] Memphis that's today if you will hear
[32:43] his
[32:44] voice Harden not your heart let's read
[32:47] Psalm 95 together oh come let us sing
[32:51] unto the Lord let us Make a Joyful Noise
[32:54] to the rock of our Salvation let us come

[33:41] this generation and said it is a people

[1:06:03] that we are looking for the last one
[1:06:05] amen so it's not time to relax it's the
[1:06:08] time to get to work it's time to do
[1:06:11] everything every member of the body
[1:06:13] supplying to the need of the body so we
[1:06:15] can get there as quick as possible amen
[1:06:18] uh Luke chapter 14 uh this is the
[1:06:21] scripture we uh uh uh heard about the
[1:06:25] red Wednesday uh verse 16 and the
[1:06:29] scripture says that and he said unto
[1:06:31] unto and he said unto
[1:06:33] him then said he unto him he said a
[1:06:36] certain man made a great supper and bade
[1:06:39] many and send his servant at at supper
[1:06:43] time remember now it's the evening time
[1:06:45] to say to them that were being come for
[1:06:49] all things are now ready and they all
[1:06:52] with uh one con beg begin to make
[1:06:56] excuses the first said to him I have
[1:06:59] bought a piece of ground I must need to
[1:07:01] go and see it it says I pray the have me
[1:07:05] excus another said I have bought five
[1:07:08] yolks of uh yolks of ausen oxen and I go
[1:07:11] to prove them I pray the have me excuse
[1:07:14] and and another said I have Mar I have
[1:07:17] married a wife and therefore I cannot
[1:07:19] come so the servant came and showed his
[1:07:22] Lord these things then the ma then the
[1:07:25] Master of the House Began uh being angry
[1:07:28] said unto his servant go out quickly
[1:07:30] into the streets and and the lanes and
[1:07:33] of the cities and bring hither the poor
[1:07:37] and the the maiden and the Halt and the
[1:07:40] Blind and it says and these and the
[1:07:43] servant said Lord it is done and NY
[1:07:46] house as th commanded and yet there's
[1:07:49] room now I want you to see I thought
[1:07:52] this was so capturing to my mind because
[1:07:56] remember the category now that's being
[1:07:58] called is completely different from the
[1:08:00] category that was invited so first it
[1:08:03] was those that had means and those that
[1:08:05] had ways and and all of that and banam
[1:08:08] points it out when he talks we we read
[1:08:10] it we we we we heard it Wednesday when
[1:08:13] he talks it says oh they are illiterate
[1:08:15] bunch of people and all of that and he
[1:08:17] said you have them for 400 years what
[1:08:19] have you done with them right so God is
[1:08:21] Not Looking for how smart we are how
[1:08:24] intellectual we are how we can expand
[1:08:27] things and do things and make him look
[1:08:29] like they never been before he's looking
[1:08:31] for those that are
[1:08:33] needy if you go you look at all of this
[1:08:36] category they had some type of need
[1:08:39] within their bodies they were hungry
[1:08:41] there were there were those that were
[1:08:42] blind there were those that that were on
[1:08:44] the Wayside they were looking for
[1:08:46] someone to help them so the Lord is here
[1:08:49] to help those that have need of him
[1:08:51] those that recognize the need of him
[1:08:53] that's the one so he said and the Lord
[1:08:56] said unto his servant go in go out into
[1:08:59] the highways and the edges and compel
[1:09:01] them to come in that my house may be
[1:09:03] filled for I say unto you it says that
[1:09:06] none of those men which were bat shall
[1:09:10] taste of my supper father we ask that
[1:09:12] you bless your word to us in the name of
[1:09:14] Jesus Christ amen God bless you may have
[1:09:16] your seats this
[1:09:18] morning so I have somewhat of
[1:09:22] uh
[1:09:27] uh interesting
[1:09:29] title uh we'll see how we go and and and
[1:09:33] and the Lord will help us I want to
[1:09:35] speak on
[1:09:37] accepting accepting God's in uh
[1:09:41] infallible word
[1:09:45] invitation accepting God's infallible
[1:09:48] word
[1:09:50] invitation the the prophet right out of
[1:09:53] this message he he makes uh such a
[1:09:55] comment right at the top of it and he
[1:09:58] says that it's men's nature to always
[1:10:01] turn God's uh invitation
[1:10:03] down it's n is in is in it's in his
[1:10:06] nature every time and and we can take
[1:10:11] ourselves and place ourselves at this
[1:10:13] and see the application of it because I
[1:10:15] don't think the word is preached to
[1:10:16] somebody else it's preached to our own
[1:10:18] selves so every time we look at the word
[1:10:20] we need to look at ourselves it's us
[1:10:22] looking ourselves in the mirror
[1:10:24] and so he he says there would come and
[1:10:27] the word will be preached this morning
[1:10:29] as any other time and but yet within our
[1:10:32] minds if we are not careful there will
[1:10:34] be some excuses why we cannot accept it
[1:10:37] well that's too good oh that's that's
[1:10:40] that's for somebody else or whether it
[1:10:42] be correction whether it be Grace or
[1:10:45] whichever way it comes there's always
[1:10:48] within the human mind this battle of of
[1:10:51] accepting and and and re rejecting and
[1:10:54] and and trying to place it for somebody
[1:10:56] else or trying to place it in a position
[1:10:59] where why they cannot receive it they'll
[1:11:01] say you are pardon and say no no my sins
[1:11:04] are in a separate category they're very
[1:11:07] different uh the the blood is not really
[1:11:09] strong enough even though you can come
[1:11:12] today you are it's preached to you you
[1:11:14] believe it but yet tomorrow the devil is
[1:11:16] going to come and point it right back to
[1:11:18] you and and so it's always a constant
[1:11:21] battle between the acceptance and and
[1:11:24] the fighting to to to to reject or to
[1:11:27] feel like you're not good enough and it
[1:11:29] goes on both sides there are those that
[1:11:32] the word will be preached and they'll
[1:11:33] feel like well it's not strong enough
[1:11:35] for them uh it's not it's lacking
[1:11:38] something or there's a mistake how many
[1:11:41] people claim there's mistakes in the
[1:11:43] message how many people have rejected
[1:11:45] this Prophet because of his education so
[1:11:49] whether it be on one side or the other
[1:11:51] there's always a reason that man comes
[1:11:53] up with on why they are not fully
[1:11:56] committed to the word of God oh you know
[1:11:59] it's not really the application is not
[1:12:01] really what I'm expecting and and all of
[1:12:04] that is the the the running away from
[1:12:07] the obligation of the word is the
[1:12:09] running away from the dedication to the
[1:12:12] word is the running away from the effect
[1:12:15] of the word in their lives is the
[1:12:17] running way of belonging to the word so
[1:12:21] there's always and and this is human
[1:12:24] nature that we speaking about here it's
[1:12:27] always to try to place you somewhere
[1:12:30] outside of the promise and the
[1:12:32] guarantees of things that God is doing
[1:12:35] the word will be preached and and and
[1:12:37] perhaps you have a loved one that you
[1:12:39] have within your heart or you or you may
[1:12:41] be sick or have a a a condition that you
[1:12:44] need God to help you but yet while the
[1:12:46] word is being preach the devil is moving
[1:12:49] you every step out of what is being
[1:12:52] preached to let you you know that you
[1:12:54] don't qualify for it now I'm here to
[1:12:56] tell you this morning you qualify for it
[1:12:59] this word of God is for you is written
[1:13:01] for you and it's written to change that
[1:13:04] circumstance into something that God
[1:13:06] himself will come and fix for
[1:13:11] you now the the prophet will say this
[1:13:14] and it will say in that same message is
[1:13:17] your life worthy of the Gospel paragraph
[1:13:18] 34 he say now Jesus is here it says man
[1:13:22] always tries to make excuses not to
[1:13:25] receive God's word of his invitation
[1:13:28] though it be firmly proven to them oh my
[1:13:33] it's not about oh I I I I didn't
[1:13:36] understand it the god the end time
[1:13:39] manifestation came with a proof that no
[1:13:42] one else has ever seen before the end
[1:13:45] time word when it came it came with the
[1:13:48] Vindication of the pillar of fire itself
[1:13:51] but the the scripture says now remember
[1:13:53] remember that the Lord your God will
[1:13:55] raise another Prophet like it unto Moses
[1:13:58] and we seen that Prophet it was Jesus
[1:14:00] Christ but yet in the end time God comes
[1:14:03] right back and he does something to the
[1:14:05] Gentile exactly like he did with the
[1:14:08] Jews but yet there is people finding a
[1:14:11] way out of it so they can find an excuse
[1:14:14] why they shouldn't believe
[1:14:18] it I'm going a little too fast it
[1:14:21] says firmly Pro to them he says it it's
[1:14:25] it's his supper and his invitation but
[1:14:27] man is constantly making excuses and if
[1:14:31] you read uh in s uh Matthew 22 you'll
[1:14:35] find out that the excuse were made where
[1:14:38] it says it went back all the ages it
[1:14:40] says he went back into the age and he
[1:14:43] said a man bid them and had a Vineyard
[1:14:46] he said uh and and and we found that the
[1:14:50] parable it says how the servant how his
[1:14:53] servant to uh and he he sent his servant
[1:14:56] to collect for his Vineyard first
[1:14:58] servant came what did they do they run
[1:15:01] him off the next servant came they also
[1:15:04] stoned him they also stoned him and they
[1:15:07] turn him and they ran him and they ran
[1:15:09] after servants off it says cruel man the
[1:15:13] king sent finally his
[1:15:15] son Oh my he he's trying to convince
[1:15:20] this group of people he's trying
[1:15:22] everything that he can to to let them
[1:15:25] know that there's an invitation that's
[1:15:26] been extended here there's something
[1:15:29] here that God the master is trying to do
[1:15:31] for you the master is trying to have you
[1:15:33] continue in the way that you are going
[1:15:35] he's trying to help you but yet they are
[1:15:38] running away from it he sent his son and
[1:15:41] when his son came we found out that they
[1:15:43] said this is an heir we'll kill him and
[1:15:46] then we have all the things then Jesus
[1:15:49] said to them the king sent forth and
[1:15:51] slew those men
[1:15:53] it says those those murderers and and
[1:15:56] burn the cities it continues in
[1:15:59] paragraph 36 it says now see when God
[1:16:02] gives a man an invitation and to do
[1:16:05] something or to receive the invitation
[1:16:08] that's given him he turns it down then
[1:16:11] there's nothing
[1:16:15] left when when you remember he he said
[1:16:19] that it was sending three pools even
[1:16:22] when this the first time he went they
[1:16:24] refused the second and the third all of
[1:16:27] that was the purpose of getting them to
[1:16:29] come to the supper but they continually
[1:16:32] rejected it and then he says when they
[1:16:35] do that they will do it for the final
[1:16:38] time it says after Mercy is spurned by
[1:16:41] judgment it says if you step over the
[1:16:45] boundaries of Mercy he says then there's
[1:16:47] only one thing left and that is the
[1:16:49] judgment and we find that man has done
[1:16:52] that in all ages it happened most every
[1:16:56] age in the Bible so every age when God
[1:17:01] is taking his infallible word is s man
[1:17:06] is always finding a way to turn it the
[1:17:08] invitation down and it will they would
[1:17:11] have excuse as they have here says one
[1:17:14] said well I just bought a piece of land
[1:17:16] I got to go and take care of it I've
[1:17:18] bought an ox and I got to go and prove
[1:17:20] it and I've gotten married I need to go
[1:17:23] I can't come and all of this and I want
[1:17:25] to say this it it didn't matter what the
[1:17:28] excuse was the the result was the
[1:17:33] same because we can sit here and begin
[1:17:37] to say out of this three man who really
[1:17:40] had the excuse to not come was it the
[1:17:42] one who was married was it the one who
[1:17:44] bought the oxen was it the one who just
[1:17:47] bought a piece of land and you you can
[1:17:50] look and I want to say this whatever the
[1:17:52] condition is the the the you you hear
[1:17:55] this morning it's not because of the
[1:17:57] lack of excuse of not being in the house
[1:17:59] of
[1:18:02] God and I want you to hear what I just
[1:18:04] said it's not because you didn't have an
[1:18:07] excuse you you the therefore will always
[1:18:09] find your weak points he will always
[1:18:12] find something that he can trigger to
[1:18:14] keep you out of the promises of God He
[1:18:17] will always come and and he's the enemy
[1:18:20] remember they they presented thems elves
[1:18:23] something that would not make them
[1:18:26] qualified to come to the
[1:18:28] feast this is not something that the one
[1:18:31] who invited took into
[1:18:34] consideration it the one who invited he
[1:18:38] didn't care what the situation was he
[1:18:40] didn't care how a sinner you were he
[1:18:43] didn't care what family you came from he
[1:18:45] didn't care what your background was he
[1:18:48] invited you to the feast so you can show
[1:18:50] up but you took the word that he gave
[1:18:53] you and you begin to find within your
[1:18:56] own life reasons why you couldn't
[1:18:58] qualify for the feast and I want to say
[1:19:01] this there's always something present
[1:19:04] humanly speaking in this life that we
[1:19:06] can attribute to our desire or a lack
[1:19:10] thereof of qualifying for the things of
[1:19:13] God the devil is always there to provide
[1:19:15] you a reason now remember it's
[1:19:18] reasonable to
[1:19:19] you it makes sense to you why you
[1:19:22] shouldn't be there it makes sense to you
[1:19:25] why you you could be you need to be
[1:19:27] excused it makes sense but at the end of
[1:19:30] the day the effect is the same is that
[1:19:33] you are not partaking of the things that
[1:19:35] God wants you to take of you are not
[1:19:38] taking full benefit of the word that's
[1:19:40] been given to you and I want to say it
[1:19:43] doesn't matter because remember he's the
[1:19:46] master of creating
[1:19:51] circumstances faith is the master of
[1:19:54] circumstances but Satan creates them
[1:19:58] all he's he's the master at taking
[1:20:02] things and packaging it and and
[1:20:04] presenting to you in a way that you will
[1:20:07] look and say oh my I I don't see myself
[1:20:10] in that that that's just too complicated
[1:20:13] for me oh that's just too high for me
[1:20:15] I'm not educated therefore I cannot no
[1:20:18] it's given to all people it's given the
[1:20:21] word of God when Jesus died the
[1:20:23] scripture says that he died for the sins
[1:20:25] of the world entire world but yet how
[1:20:29] many received him
[1:20:31] right so it's not uh the LA of God
[1:20:35] trying but it's we have to examine
[1:20:38] ourselves and see what is it in my life
[1:20:40] that's uh uh blocking me or that's
[1:20:43] stopping me from serving God fully what
[1:20:46] is it in my life that's stopping me from
[1:20:48] being a church every service what is it
[1:20:50] in my life that's stopping me to be
[1:20:52] committed to to this gospel what is it
[1:20:54] in my life that's stopping me from
[1:20:56] giving my all to God Amen because that's
[1:20:59] the thing that will stop you from being
[1:21:01] at the supper it's not that the word is
[1:21:04] not good enough but it's that you have
[1:21:07] found an excuse somewhere whether it be
[1:21:09] on one side or the other to stop
[1:21:12] yourself from
[1:21:17] participating I hope that's not too
[1:21:19] strong just trying to help us this
[1:21:22] morning
[1:21:24] so that it doesn't matter how it's
[1:21:28] presented the end result is the same it
[1:21:31] doesn't matter the reason what matter is
[1:21:33] the
[1:21:39] result and so the scripture will say in
[1:21:42] Matthew
[1:21:43] 13:1 which is another Parable that Jesus
[1:21:47] speaks and he said it says the it says
[1:21:50] the same day when Jesus uh Jesus out of
[1:21:53] this um the same day went Jesus out of
[1:21:56] the house and sat in the seaside and he
[1:21:59] said a great multitude were gathered
[1:22:01] together unto
[1:22:03] him so he knew so he went into a ship
[1:22:08] and said and the whole multitude stood
[1:22:11] uh stood on the Shor
[1:22:14] side excuse
[1:22:18] me the whole multitude set on the uh uh
[1:22:22] a sh
[1:22:25] side and he spake many things unto them
[1:22:29] in Parable saying behold or so went
[1:22:32] forth and he swed and when he SED he
[1:22:35] said some seed fell up fell by the
[1:22:37] wayside and the fouls came and devoured
[1:22:41] them it said some fell upon the Tony uh
[1:22:44] Tony place it says where they had no
[1:22:47] much Earth no much Earth and and and and
[1:22:52] uh forth with and it says they sprung up
[1:22:55] because they had no
[1:22:58] deepness deep they they sprung up
[1:23:00] because they had no deepness of Earth
[1:23:02] and when the sun was up they they were
[1:23:06] scorched it says and because they had no
[1:23:09] roots they withered away and some fell
[1:23:12] among tones and the tone sprungs up and
[1:23:15] then he choked them and it says and
[1:23:17] other fell into a good ground and
[1:23:21] brought fruits brought both fruits and
[1:23:23] some 100-fold and some six 60-fold and
[1:23:27] some 30 fold so now year he is and and
[1:23:31] and it's a almost a similar Parable you
[1:23:34] you can see the circumstances you can
[1:23:37] see it wasn't because of the lack of
[1:23:39] seed and we know the seed represent the
[1:23:42] word of God it wasn't because there was
[1:23:45] no word sent forth it wasn't because uh
[1:23:48] uh the word was not good enough but it
[1:23:51] was the even when the word was sent it
[1:23:53] was the condition of the ground that
[1:23:56] determined what will be what would be
[1:23:58] got what you get at the Harvest so the
[1:24:01] ground that was not deep enough that
[1:24:03] didn't take the seed in and and swallow
[1:24:05] it in and and took care of the seed that
[1:24:08] ground didn't bring any much and the
[1:24:10] ground that had the tonnes out of it now
[1:24:12] remember all of this is within the
[1:24:14] ground the ground that had the tonnes on
[1:24:16] it and everything it took the seed when
[1:24:18] it grew up it choked it and everything
[1:24:21] and the prophet will tell us those are
[1:24:22] the cares of life and things so you find
[1:24:24] out in every application it wasn't the
[1:24:27] lack in the word it was the lack of the
[1:24:30] ground being ready to receive the seed
[1:24:33] and what the ground did with the seed
[1:24:35] that he had
[1:24:38] received and and I want to say this this
[1:24:41] morning it it's very important because
[1:24:44] we we have to look at the type of fruits
[1:24:47] that we are bringing we have to look at
[1:24:49] the type of life that we are living it
[1:24:51] says is the life life that I'm living is
[1:24:53] it Worthy is it a life worthy of the
[1:24:56] Gospel that I have received why because
[1:24:59] yes a Pastor said the other he says as
[1:25:02] far as the world is going down we should
[1:25:03] be moving up when you receive the Gospel
[1:25:06] is not to keep you level up with the
[1:25:09] things of the world it's not to keep you
[1:25:11] coping with the things of the world but
[1:25:13] it's to bring you up from the things of
[1:25:15] the world into the manifestation of the
[1:25:18] things of the kingdom of God now I I
[1:25:21] want to say this I'm I'm glad that God
[1:25:23] has a prepared ground this morning in
[1:25:26] his word because remember the last group
[1:25:28] of seed it says when he fall he fall
[1:25:31] onto a good ground and the prophet said
[1:25:34] that that ground is a prepared
[1:25:36] predestinated ground in that word God
[1:25:40] has a ground that he's been working on
[1:25:42] since the beginning of time that in the
[1:25:45] end time I will not even though my seed
[1:25:47] will be sent out on the worldall even
[1:25:50] though my word will be the word of ation
[1:25:53] will be heard by all that have ears but
[1:25:55] he knew that there will be a group of
[1:25:57] people a designated group of people a
[1:26:01] designated piece of ground that would
[1:26:03] receive that seed and when they receive
[1:26:06] it it will bring forth a h
[1:26:10] hundredfold and and I want to say this
[1:26:12] this morning perhaps this morning all
[1:26:14] you bringing forth is 3 fold don't stop
[1:26:18] there don't don't don't sell yourself
[1:26:21] short don't give yourself an excuse find
[1:26:24] out what do I need to do from where I am
[1:26:27] so I can move forth in the 60 fold and
[1:26:30] if I'm bringing only the 60 fold what do
[1:26:32] I need to do so I can get in the 100
[1:26:34] fold so because the more word we receive
[1:26:37] is the more word will
[1:26:41] Express I don't have time to read this
[1:26:44] but Pam said Jesus believed the word and
[1:26:48] he says he was he believed the word
[1:26:50] until he became one with with the word
[1:26:53] that's
[1:26:54] right I thought Jesus was the word he
[1:26:57] says they believed it so much that he
[1:27:01] became one with the word and and the
[1:27:04] reason I like it is because the prophet
[1:27:06] is trying to take you from the excuse
[1:27:09] section where I'm not good enough oh
[1:27:12] Jesus was the word I'm not the word how
[1:27:14] am I going to become the word now he
[1:27:15] tells you now Jesus he believed so much
[1:27:18] the word that he became one with the
[1:27:21] word
[1:27:24] and if this morning we can believe the
[1:27:26] word so much until we become one with
[1:27:29] the word we'll have the same expression
[1:27:32] we'll have the same God manifested in
[1:27:34] our lives so the prepare ground I want
[1:27:36] to say this morning that this prepared
[1:27:38] ground is not interested in the cares of
[1:27:41] life right is not interested in what the
[1:27:44] world has to offer this prepared ground
[1:27:47] cares about one thing and I need to
[1:27:49] bring a h hundredfold of the word that's
[1:27:52] been committed to me that is a personal
[1:27:55] decision because remember this is a
[1:27:57] personal relationship as the prophet
[1:27:59] will say that is a personal uh uh uh
[1:28:02] decision that individual makes when the
[1:28:05] word of God is preached unto them is to
[1:28:08] say that God I want thaty word to
[1:28:10] produce a hundredfold in my life there
[1:28:13] has to be a desire within your heart
[1:28:15] there has to be an application of the
[1:28:17] word there has to be a commitment to the
[1:28:20] word there has to be an obligation to
[1:28:22] the
[1:28:28] word and so it's not it's a
[1:28:31] predestinated ground regardless of the
[1:28:34] reason regardless of whatever season and
[1:28:38] condition it find itself in it doesn't
[1:28:41] make any
[1:28:42] excuses it press forward like the
[1:28:45] prophet will talk about the Lily it says
[1:28:49] it it could have looked and said well I
[1:28:51] have all all kinds of excuses why I
[1:28:53] shouldn't go out I have all kinds of
[1:28:56] excuses why my this flower cannot go up
[1:28:59] I have all the MK I have all of this I
[1:29:01] have all of this against me I'll just
[1:29:03] stay
[1:29:05] here but even in that condition that it
[1:29:08] was because it was predestinated to be
[1:29:11] called by the sunlight it didn't make an
[1:29:13] excuse it continued to push until it
[1:29:16] came out to the
[1:29:18] sunlight now I I want to read this and
[1:29:21] and before I move on and I I hope this
[1:29:24] is going to now remember I I said this
[1:29:27] is a predestinated uh piece of ground
[1:29:31] it's as the prophet will say so even
[1:29:33] when the word is going forth it was not
[1:29:36] addressed to all it was only addressed
[1:29:39] to a certain particular but the prophet
[1:29:41] will speak this in the message is it is
[1:29:43] the rising of the sun paragraph 124 he
[1:29:46] says now oh my the predestinated one he
[1:29:50] says of course I like like it says it
[1:29:53] says like the seed laid upon the
[1:29:56] Earth it says the one that laid that the
[1:29:59] one that had life in them it says many
[1:30:02] of them were dead they were just rotten
[1:30:05] seeds they were rotten seed the water
[1:30:08] and the things burned them out it says
[1:30:10] but you know there was a seed laying
[1:30:13] ready for
[1:30:15] life oh I trust you're ready for life
[1:30:18] this morning God I'm always ready
[1:30:20] because remember he said
[1:30:22] the the
[1:30:23] this it's not about a one- time thing
[1:30:27] it's a constant battling every day for
[1:30:30] the expression of Christ out of your
[1:30:32] life it's a Daily Grind it's a daily
[1:30:35] pushing it's a daily exercise every
[1:30:38] morning you woke up Satan already got
[1:30:41] his priority set it up for you what
[1:30:43] you're going to do and everything that
[1:30:45] is caused all the chaos that is caused
[1:30:47] for you you have to work up and say I
[1:30:49] refuse to take your priority I take the
[1:30:52] priority of the word I'll put God first
[1:30:55] and go
[1:30:59] forward we heard brother Tim Sal mention
[1:31:02] and I it has to be I I'm working up
[1:31:06] today my my my my primary goal is that I
[1:31:10] need God to speak to me about the
[1:31:12] direction of the day I need God to show
[1:31:14] me what I need to do it's not just me
[1:31:17] running around all day long putting out
[1:31:20] fires put out fire here fire over there
[1:31:23] put out fire over there fire you'll do
[1:31:25] that every day I I'll say this I go to
[1:31:28] sleep not finishing what I had to do the
[1:31:31] day before and what and then yet there's
[1:31:34] more waiting for me the next
[1:31:41] day sorry so so he says uh there were
[1:31:47] pred rating for life it says God know it
[1:31:50] was laying there there now listen to
[1:31:53] this now the predestinated ones are the
[1:31:57] first to be quickened by the Holy Ghost
[1:32:00] for the for the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit
[1:32:03] comes to claim its own remember now in
[1:32:06] this message that's where the Prophet
[1:32:08] tells us that the Holy Spirit was sent
[1:32:11] to hunt those predestinated seed to hunt
[1:32:14] them out to bring them out of whatever
[1:32:17] holes they were in wherever they will
[1:32:19] run and hide they will come and kick
[1:32:21] them out out this is not a peaceful
[1:32:23] coming this is a shaking of Your World
[1:32:26] this is a kicking you out of wherever
[1:32:28] you are in this is changing your world
[1:32:30] so you understand that God is the only
[1:32:32] thing that's important and I want to say
[1:32:34] this if you are predestinated seed you
[1:32:37] got to wait for the shaking coming if
[1:32:39] you are not living right wait for the
[1:32:41] shaking is coming why God will get you
[1:32:44] whatever out you are in he will bring
[1:32:46] you into his
[1:32:50] program it's it's the hunting it's not
[1:32:53] the piss for oh please come oh he will
[1:32:56] lay you flat on your back he will do
[1:32:59] whatever it takes so you can come so
[1:33:02] either you come peacefully or you come
[1:33:04] by hunting but either way you will come
[1:33:09] in we fail to realize that God is in
[1:33:12] control of all of it
[1:33:16] anyway so the Holy Spirit comes out and
[1:33:21] he's the desire his objective is to
[1:33:23] Quicken nose the predestinated one by
[1:33:27] his word so when they hear the word
[1:33:29] something within the heart a
[1:33:31] predestinated seed within will hear and
[1:33:34] hunger for the reality of the word to be
[1:33:36] manifested now it says now the
[1:33:38] predestinated one it says uh uh the pr
[1:33:41] are the ones are first quickened by the
[1:33:43] Holy Ghost it says for the Holy Ghost
[1:33:45] comes to claim those uh it says now this
[1:33:48] is deep now listen be sure to catch this
[1:33:52] good now paragraph 126 it says now it
[1:33:55] says the sun was sent across the Earth
[1:33:59] not to Quicken not to bring the
[1:34:02] Rocks not to bring the Rocks which are
[1:34:05] the dirt
[1:34:07] also this is very
[1:34:12] important to life it was not to bring
[1:34:16] all the
[1:34:18] dirt to life but was was to bring the
[1:34:23] part of the dirt which was
[1:34:26] enclosed around a
[1:34:30] life oh I read this this morning my
[1:34:33] heart was just overflowing I couldn't
[1:34:36] even contain myself not all men will
[1:34:39] receive Christ but oh but those which
[1:34:43] God for ordained to life for ordained
[1:34:46] life in in a house around some of the
[1:34:49] dirt of the earth he said says those he
[1:34:52] says that's the one that he comes to
[1:34:55] Quicken he says they are the ones he
[1:34:58] says that's that now that dirt would lay
[1:35:02] there in the Sun and
[1:35:06] say the sun is too
[1:35:10] hot and let me say this it say the sun
[1:35:14] is too hot the rocks will say this old
[1:35:18] son is too hot now let me say this and
[1:35:21] and I feel like it's very important I
[1:35:23] say this the the the Rocks when the sun
[1:35:26] comes it gets hot it shout it jumps and
[1:35:31] it brings forth oh it's it's in it's on
[1:35:34] fire but the moment the sun goes down
[1:35:37] it's back cold again and he waits for
[1:35:40] the sun to come up again so it can get
[1:35:43] hot and then cold and then hot and then
[1:35:47] cold but when the seed the plant
[1:35:50] receives it it's another type but what
[1:35:53] I'm saying that when you receive it and
[1:35:55] let me just say this this is me saying
[1:35:57] it God has a process of the energy
[1:36:01] transfer the sun will transfer the
[1:36:03] energy that he has into the plant and it
[1:36:07] becomes food for the plant and the plant
[1:36:10] is able to grow to move out of the cycle
[1:36:14] of hot and cold down and up and and
[1:36:18] going this way and that way God created
[1:36:21] that
[1:36:24] process so don't be the son the one that
[1:36:27] would receive and just get called and
[1:36:29] get hot and hot and then get cold no ask
[1:36:32] for God that the sunlight that's coming
[1:36:35] let it be transformed into food let it
[1:36:39] feed my soul so I move from just being
[1:36:42] cold to hot and never go cold
[1:36:47] again otherwise you get stuck in the
[1:36:49] same cycle all the time
[1:36:54] time because to the Sun to the Rock it's
[1:36:59] just getting it
[1:37:00] hot man I'm getting hot and and and I
[1:37:03] love this it's getting warm and we we
[1:37:06] shouting I I I don't care if I shout or
[1:37:09] not I don't care if I'm the most quiet
[1:37:12] or if I'm the most loud low you be what
[1:37:15] God made you to
[1:37:16] be but the result of it is I need a
[1:37:19] change in a growth
[1:37:25] yes they were all part of the
[1:37:28] vegetation but the rock that Earth was
[1:37:32] not what the sun came for even though it
[1:37:36] will receive the energy of the sun it
[1:37:38] didn't know what to do with the energy
[1:37:40] except get hot and cold but the plants
[1:37:44] on the other hand knew how to go through
[1:37:46] the process of energy
[1:37:48] transformation it will Tak in the energy
[1:37:51] and someone through the process he will
[1:37:54] take that it becomes food in it it
[1:37:57] becomes food in it and he goes from
[1:37:59] going this little plant and he grows
[1:38:01] into a tree to bring forth fruits so
[1:38:04] that the master can come and take of its
[1:38:12] fruit let me move
[1:38:15] forward and the prophet will
[1:38:20] say I'll go back to the other message it
[1:38:23] said a Christian is not a tool or
[1:38:26] something of a mechanical range
[1:38:29] paragraph 129 is the life worthy of the
[1:38:31] Gospel range to bring uh to to it says
[1:38:36] arrange uh to a great big religious uh
[1:38:39] regime he says that's right a Christian
[1:38:42] is not some kind of tool that keeps
[1:38:44] religious organization moving a
[1:38:47] Christian is not it says it's not a
[1:38:49] Christian that's not a Christian it says
[1:38:51] a Christian is to be
[1:38:54] Christlike to be born again to receive
[1:38:58] the energy of the Sun and turn it into
[1:39:00] something
[1:39:02] useful it says and a Christian cannot be
[1:39:05] a Christian until Christ comes into the
[1:39:08] man the Life of Christ is in him then it
[1:39:12] produced the life that Christ lived and
[1:39:16] it says and you do things that Christ
[1:39:18] did it says what it says what am I to
[1:39:23] talk about personal what am I talking
[1:39:26] about it says personal relationship
[1:39:28] personal relationship to Christ what is
[1:39:31] it it's your is your life worthy of the
[1:39:35] Gospel so what what we are looking for
[1:39:39] is the moving forward or the the
[1:39:43] transformation out of this uh excus
[1:39:48] cycle why this cannot be
[1:39:51] why cannot be why I can't progress why I
[1:39:54] can't do this why do I seem to be
[1:39:56] failing taking those excuses turning
[1:39:59] them into something that God can come
[1:40:03] and change taking those excuses and
[1:40:06] using them as opportunity that I am
[1:40:09] lacking of the Sunray so I can receive
[1:40:12] of the Sun so I can mature in my
[1:40:16] life he said there but there's only one
[1:40:20] uh says but there's only one church and
[1:40:23] there's only one way you can get into it
[1:40:26] and that's the by birth he said you are
[1:40:29] born into the Church of Jesus Christ and
[1:40:32] a member of his body of the spiritual
[1:40:35] delegation of heaven then the signs the
[1:40:39] signs that Christ is in you the signs
[1:40:43] that Christ is with you lived through
[1:40:49] you as say
[1:40:52] this you you can take all the
[1:40:56] intellect you can take all of the
[1:40:59] understanding just give me
[1:41:03] life just give me
[1:41:06] life because this gospel didn't
[1:41:10] come to just so we can become
[1:41:13] intellectual giant but it came so that
[1:41:16] life could be produced it came to bear
[1:41:19] The Life of Christ in you it came to
[1:41:21] produce the Life of Christ in
[1:41:23] you he says here it says it says that
[1:41:27] the things will produce that it says
[1:41:29] that's the new birth the new birth is
[1:41:32] the only thing that will produce the
[1:41:34] relationship to
[1:41:36] God that's right he says a son and a
[1:41:40] daughter then then he says when this
[1:41:43] takes place he says and here's the
[1:41:46] question I get I I I get I I want to get
[1:41:49] to you it says the the man say he said
[1:41:52] uh what do you do after you've been born
[1:41:55] again listen to this many asked that
[1:41:58] question I should it says I should I
[1:42:00] said what should I then do what should I
[1:42:03] do then brother brandham if you are born
[1:42:05] again your entire nature is changed you
[1:42:09] are dead to the things you once
[1:42:14] thought and and and I I I read these
[1:42:17] things because there has to be a way by
[1:42:20] which we are know if we are progressing
[1:42:23] or not there has to be some type of
[1:42:25] fruits that's manifested out of the seed
[1:42:27] that we have received to know is the
[1:42:30] seed in me producing the very fruit that
[1:42:33] God is Desiring out of me is the seed in
[1:42:36] me marching towards the the destination
[1:42:39] that God has intended for it to
[1:42:45] go and I want to say this this
[1:42:48] morning his word to to us is an
[1:42:52] invitation for us to get out of our
[1:42:57] Humanity because remember that's where
[1:42:59] the excuse is found in our mental in our
[1:43:03] Humanity how we were because of the way
[1:43:06] we were born how we were raised how we
[1:43:09] grew up all of that presents a challenge
[1:43:11] and an excuse that we bring forth but
[1:43:14] his word is an invitation to us to get
[1:43:18] out of our humanity and to partake
[1:43:21] of his infallible
[1:43:24] word to partake of his infallible word
[1:43:28] his word in every age is an invitation
[1:43:31] to get you out of whatever you are in
[1:43:35] and get you into the land where all
[1:43:37] things are
[1:43:40] possible oh my I I I don't know about
[1:43:43] you I get tired of living in this world
[1:43:46] where everything seems impossible you
[1:43:48] can't do this you can't do that you
[1:43:50] can't do this says I want to move out of
[1:43:52] this realm and get into a realm where
[1:43:54] all things are possible and his word is
[1:43:58] what presented to
[1:44:00] you let me say this again his word in
[1:44:03] every age is an invitation to get you
[1:44:06] out of whatever you find yourself in to
[1:44:09] come into the land where all things are
[1:44:11] possible the scripture we say all things
[1:44:14] are possible to God God turns it around
[1:44:16] and says all things are possible to them
[1:44:18] that
[1:44:19] believe
[1:44:21] amen that's right so all things are
[1:44:24] possible to God all things are possible
[1:44:26] to you if you
[1:44:29] believe so we don't just take it and put
[1:44:31] it upon God God wants you to be a
[1:44:34] partaker of his divine nature he wants
[1:44:37] to share his power with you he wants you
[1:44:39] to taste what it is to be God and I'm
[1:44:43] tired to taste being like a man I want
[1:44:45] to taste what it means to be God I I
[1:44:48] want to think like one I want to think
[1:44:50] and and act like
[1:44:52] one and his word is our entrance into
[1:44:58] that his word to us this morning is an
[1:45:01] invitation of a way out of this Dying
[1:45:05] World out of this Dying World into the
[1:45:09] perfect word To The Feast that he has
[1:45:12] prepared I want to say this he said this
[1:45:14] morning ye that are heavy laden ye that
[1:45:18] are tired ye that have your take he says
[1:45:21] ye that are hungry it says those that
[1:45:24] have no money though that have no price
[1:45:26] he said come on in he's inviting you
[1:45:28] this morning don't let anything stop you
[1:45:31] this morning say God I have heard the
[1:45:33] invitation of your word in the end time

[1:45:44] what it takes to make you ready for the
[1:45:48] feast his invitation will tell you will

[1:45:56] behave like a Christian where where your
[1:45:58] seat is going to be what robe you will
[1:46:01] be dressed in how you going to get from
[1:46:03] here to there the invitation has all of
[1:46:05] that
[1:46:08] included so people reject the invitation
[1:46:11] the packages all and they go trying to
[1:46:14] find their own way to make it you won't
[1:46:16] make it outside of the
[1:46:19] invitation you'll be like that man who
[1:46:21] was
[1:46:23] found in there and all of a sudden he
[1:46:27] didn't have the
[1:46:29] robe and so they asked him they

[1:48:09] themselves he's always taken his gospel
[1:48:13] hate it from the wise and the pden those
[1:48:15] that feel like they can get there by
[1:48:17] themselves but he's always made it
[1:48:19] available to those little babes those

[1:49:02] you to make a way out of this so I can
[1:49:05] be in the supper God Will Make A Way
[1:49:09] there's no one that's going to get there
[1:49:10] by his own strength each one that will
[1:49:13] be there will have a story about the
[1:49:15] grace of God that's taking him out of
[1:49:17] the circumstances that he knew nothing
[1:49:19] about
[1:49:22] am it's not the Gathering of the the
[1:49:25] stronger no it's the Gathering of the
[1:49:28] elected those that God has paid the
[1:49:30] price for those that God has died for
[1:49:33] those are the ones that are going to be
[1:49:34] there and I want to say this regardless
[1:49:37] of the question the word is the answer
[1:49:41] the word is the answer the word is the
[1:49:43] answer to the struggle the word is the
[1:49:46] solution to a human

[1:50:44] myself the world has gone completely

[1:51:18] invitation you are putting God under the
[1:51:21] obligation to make a way so you could be
[1:51:24] there he doesn't want to hear it I
[1:51:27] didn't make it because I didn't have

[1:51:33] make it nobody came to pick me I said I

[1:51:43] Ghost I didn't make it because I
[1:51:45] couldn't overcome I will give you
[1:51:46] overcoming power it's the word it's a
[1:51:49] complete complete word it covers the
[1:51:52] beginning to the end of it it's God
[1:51:54] manifestation in the end time Oh my he
[1:51:58] has a word allotted for each generation
[1:52:00] but when it comes to the end time he
[1:52:02] pulls everything that he was that's the
[1:52:05] word we have received it says the all
[1:52:08] that God was that word was not
[1:52:10] applicable in the first age it was not
[1:52:12] applicable in the second age it was not
[1:52:14] applicable in the third age but in the
[1:52:16] end time the scripture says that all
[1:52:19] that he was he poured into Christ and
[1:52:22] Christ takes all that he was he poured
[1:52:24] into his
[1:52:26] people the full strength of God is for
[1:52:31] you
[1:52:38] amen I invite you into the land of the
[1:52:42] infallible
[1:52:43] word the land where all things are
[1:52:47] possible God's word is the God's word is
[1:52:50] the
[1:52:52] program his word to you is an invitation
[1:52:56] to the land where all things are
[1:52:58] possible is the invitation out of the
[1:53:01] main systems that we've been stuck in
[1:53:05] into the system of God it's an
[1:53:07] invitation into the land where all
[1:53:09] things are possible it's an invitation
[1:53:11] to taste and
[1:53:14] see what the Lord can
[1:53:18] do it's not given for us to just take
[1:53:22] and talk about it or just tell someone
[1:53:25] else so they can believe our story no
[1:53:28] it's given with personal invitation and
[1:53:32] personal
[1:53:34] experience so everybody that's at the
[1:53:37] table knows something about what it
[1:53:39] means to taste of God Amen
[1:53:44] hallu you say I never taste it up you
[1:53:46] just didn't see it you just haven't
[1:53:49] realized it's like that man says I I I
[1:53:51] said I the little kid said I never I
[1:53:54] want to see God I never see I said God
[1:53:55] is all
[1:53:57] over you just haven't been looking the
[1:53:59] right way you just haven't had the eyes
[1:54:01] to look at it and I want to say this
[1:54:04] this morning it's an invitation to the
[1:54:07] land of immortal it's an invitation to
[1:54:11] the Eternal eternal life forever it's
[1:54:14] moving out of the cycle where men are
[1:54:17] born and the dead and the things of the
[1:54:20] world and moving into a new cycle where
[1:54:23] you shall never die where whatever you
[1:54:27] have ch he doesn't ask you go solve your
[1:54:29] challenges then come to me no he just
[1:54:32] wants you to be
[1:54:34] elevated with all your challenges solve
[1:54:37] them not according to the human way but
[1:54:40] solve it according to God's
[1:54:45] way the problem is we try to do it
[1:54:47] ourselves God said no bring them all to
[1:54:50] me that's what I specialize in things
[1:54:52] thought
[1:54:55] impossible and let me say this the word
[1:54:58] of God is
[1:55:00] infallible I I I want to say
[1:55:02] this the word of God is infallible and
[1:55:06] when we think of God's word we are
[1:55:09] thinking about something that can never
[1:55:12] fail I want you to remember that every
[1:55:15] time you are thinking about God you are
[1:55:17] thinking about an eternal
[1:55:20] yes That Remains the Same every time
[1:55:24] something that will never fail when you
[1:55:27] take God's word we are taking the routes
[1:55:30] of the permanent of a permanent
[1:55:32] Victory when when we are taking the
[1:55:35] provided way we are taking God's
[1:55:41] solution the sad part is it seems like
[1:55:44] we have to try all of our own Solutions
[1:55:47] and when they fail that's when we try
[1:55:49] try to wonder well I wonder where God is
[1:55:52] he's been there all
[1:55:56] time he's been there all the
[1:55:59] time so we are
[1:56:01] taking when we are taking God's word we
[1:56:04] are taking God we are becoming like God
[1:56:09] himself and the result is
[1:56:13] certain excuse
[1:56:18] me
[1:56:31] in the message the super sign and I
[1:56:33] thought this was really a blessing to me
[1:56:36] uh I've heard it before but it just I
[1:56:39] was as I was meditating it just came to
[1:56:41] my mind and it was really a blessing so
[1:56:43] he says this in the message the super
[1:56:46] sign paragraph 26 it says I want I want
[1:56:49] you to notice the unchanging continuity
[1:56:52] of God's word and his
[1:56:54] work the unchanging continuity of God's
[1:56:58] word and his work he says he never
[1:57:01] changes he he never changes his program
[1:57:04] he never changes his way just as perfect
[1:57:08] perfectly the scripture is in perfect
[1:57:10] continuity everything that God does is
[1:57:13] in continuity with what he
[1:57:16] done that's right so when we when we
[1:57:19] come to God oh I love this that's why
[1:57:22] the scripture cannot be broken when we
[1:57:25] read the scripture and we read about
[1:57:26] Martha and we read about Moses we read
[1:57:28] about all of them we know that the
[1:57:31] continuity will make that God will make
[1:57:33] that word the same it cannot he cannot
[1:57:37] come to Moses and save him and come to
[1:57:39] you and fail you the continuity is
[1:57:41] broken so therefore the prophet will
[1:57:44] tell us we need to be a people with an
[1:57:47] understanding as because remember I I
[1:57:49] keep saying this the word is an
[1:57:51] invitation into this word is this in
[1:57:54] this infallibility of who he is so when
[1:57:56] he's giving you his word you know that
[1:57:58] you are becoming infallible as you are
[1:58:01] receiving his
[1:58:04] word you mean infallible yes you won't
[1:58:08] fail you won't go wrong you won't you
[1:58:11] won't be denied you won't be cast down
[1:58:14] you can't be lost the scripture says
[1:58:16] what shall we say of these things if God
[1:58:19] for us oh my if we can only get God on
[1:58:23] our side if we understand that he's
[1:58:26] there on our side what can go
[1:58:30] wrong it's like having a little child
[1:58:32] you know my kids thinks I can fix
[1:58:34] everything so they'll go and break
[1:58:36] something and I look and I see oh yeah
[1:58:38] this I could put it together and then
[1:58:40] they break it a different way and then
[1:58:42] bring it back and then they'll bring it
[1:58:44] another time I'm looking at it I was
[1:58:45] like I can't fix it they don't
[1:58:47] understand that because as far as far as
[1:58:49] they're concerned I have to fix it I'm
[1:58:51] the dad I I'm I'm the one who supposed
[1:58:54] to know and when you look at them in
[1:58:56] confusion you're like I don't know what
[1:58:58] to do they look at you and they're like
[1:59:00] what do you mean you don't know oh I
[1:59:02] tell you that's how it is with God but
[1:59:05] we are me we fail but God never failed
[1:59:08] it doesn't matter which way you break it
[1:59:11] it doesn't matter which way you turn it
[1:59:13] it doesn't matter what confusion you
[1:59:15] find yourself in you bring it to him he
[1:59:17] will fix it
[1:59:22] it's the infallibility of God I have
[1:59:25] spoken my word I can't take it back my
[1:59:28] word can't go and return for it it will
[1:59:30] produce every
[1:59:35] time oh my let let's realize that every
[1:59:39] day when you woke up in the morning
[1:59:41] don't forget that when you in trouble
[1:59:44] don't forget that just understand my
[1:59:47] father is able I miss stop I shouldn't
[1:59:50] have done this I don't know how I got
[1:59:52] myself into it but one thing I know is
[1:59:54] my father can fix
[1:59:56] [Music]
[2:00:03] it it just works my heart you know when
[2:00:07] we go on and you know we here supposed
[2:00:10] to be the light and yet Our lives our
[2:00:13] priorities are messed up and we have all
[2:00:15] kinds of things coming in and all of
[2:00:17] that and you wonder where is our mind at
[2:00:21] what's causing all of this why are we
[2:00:23] rejecting the invitation can we not see
[2:00:26] that God is here calling day and night
[2:00:28] can we not say that he wants to resolve
[2:00:31] your problem you have money problem God
[2:00:33] will solve it you have a job problem God
[2:00:36] will solve it you have a sickness
[2:00:38] problem you put God first the the
[2:00:41] problem is we don't want to put him
[2:00:42] first you put him first you say God if I
[2:00:46] lose it I lose it because I put you
[2:00:48] first yes he will come to your rescue
[2:00:52] you want to see God come to work you put
[2:00:54] his word first you will see the mighty
[2:00:57] conqueror you will see him in a way you
[2:00:59] never seen him
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:04] before God's character is always shown
[2:01:08] up in people being in
[2:01:12] despair the name of God is not a title
[2:01:15] it's something that God
[2:01:18] earned yes that's
[2:01:21] right when we call him Jehovah Jara is
[2:01:24] not out of the suddenly just say call me
[2:01:27] Jehova no he came to one named Abraham
[2:01:30] who was supposed to give his son who was
[2:01:33] supposed to give his son to be dead and
[2:01:35] he stood there and he took his son and
[2:01:37] he was about to kill him the angel came
[2:01:40] and hold his hand and says do not do
[2:01:42] that out of this place God created a
[2:01:47] lamb that's right
[2:01:51] God created a lamb out of nowhere that's
[2:01:55] where he got his name
[2:02:01] from what is your situation
[2:02:05] right out of all the seven Redemptive
[2:02:08] name is there not one that comes to mind
[2:02:10] is not one that's going to be applicable
[2:02:13] if you need three names he'll come and
[2:02:15] combine all three
[2:02:17] names
[2:02:21] the the woman who came and Jesus told
[2:02:24] him that I can't give the food of the
[2:02:26] children to dogs there was no place for
[2:02:29] him in the Kingdom of the Jews but he
[2:02:31] said thou Al Lord the creator of all she
[2:02:34] invoked not a
[2:02:36] title she couldn't approach him as a son
[2:02:38] of David she had no right coming as a
[2:02:41] son of a daughter of David but she came
[2:02:44] and said I know even though you are the
[2:02:47] son of David you are also Lord of all
[2:02:49] things and not created another place she
[2:02:53] tapped another title that God was
[2:02:55] obligated to come in
[2:02:59] help what title do you need this morning
[2:03:02] let's not be ashamed let's not be bitten
[2:03:05] down the Christian has to be the most
[2:03:07] happy person that's on the face of the
[2:03:09] Earth because you have something that
[2:03:11] the world doesn't have you have access
[2:03:14] to something that the world knows
[2:03:16] nothing about yes thank thank
[2:03:22] you sorry we'll continue another time if
[2:03:25] the musician can
[2:03:30] [Applause]
[2:03:40] come the infallible word of the Mighty
[2:03:44] God he doesn't want it to remain up in
[2:03:47] heaven he wants the application of it in
[2:03:50] this human realm he wants to give you
[2:03:52] access into a place where all things are
[2:03:56] possible where God is manifesting
[2:03:58] himself constantly where he can come and
[2:04:01] move on your behalf where you can come
[2:04:04] and know for sure that I'm standing on
[2:04:06] God's word and I cannot be
[2:04:10] moved not be one that runs through and
[2:04:13] fro and pray and then run away oh God
[2:04:16] must have not hurt me I have two plans
[2:04:19] if God doesn't do I'll do
[2:04:22] no he wants you to be
[2:04:24] committed he wants you to be dedicated
[2:04:27] to his word it's his word or
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:36] nothing see the challenges of
[2:04:39] life shouldn't be the determining factor
[2:04:42] of our
[2:04:47] Christianity it doesn't matter how hard
[2:04:50] the things get out there you hold on to
[2:04:54] him don't do oh the challeng is are
[2:04:57] pulling you you let go of him and you go
[2:04:59] take care no you hold let the challenge
[2:05:02] if it's going to rip it off let it rip
[2:05:04] off what is
[2:05:07] it we afraid God can't repair whatever
[2:05:10] the devil can
[2:05:13] do now think about the Bor that bam
[2:05:16] talks about in Finland yeah he is is
[2:05:19] just ran over completely dead blood
[2:05:21] flowing
[2:05:23] out now where when he was raised where
[2:05:26] did that blood come from did God go and
[2:05:28] collect all the blood off of the floor
[2:05:30] and put it back in
[2:05:32] [Music]
[2:05:33] him what happened the woman in Mexico
[2:05:37] with a dead
[2:05:39] baby it was pronounced dead it was
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:44] done what
[2:05:47] happened see the woman believe in the
[2:05:50] infallible God he just knew that if I
[2:05:53] can get to this man to pray for my baby
[2:05:56] I know that God will do something she
[2:05:58] went and she fought and Billy Paul said
[2:06:00] that I try to get her to stop all the
[2:06:02] deacons everybody they couldn't stop her
[2:06:05] there's nothing that could stop her my
[2:06:07] brother my sister we need that kind of
[2:06:08] challenge we need that kind of favor we
[2:06:11] need that kind of fights inside of
[2:06:13] us we don't something happen and we qu
[2:06:17] and we no we need the type of fight that
[2:06:19] I'm not going to quit God is with me if
[2:06:23] I'm going through challenges he knows
[2:06:25] I'm going through challenges I'm going
[2:06:27] to stay here until it does something for
[2:06:29] me and if it's content for me to be here
[2:06:32] in my suffering I'll stay in my
[2:06:34] suffering but what says what would it
[2:06:36] take if you would live a million
[2:06:39] years it says I'll still take eternal
[2:06:42] life because out of the after the
[2:06:45] million year suffering I will live
[2:06:48] forever
[2:06:51] but we have it the other way we have all
[2:06:53] the cares of this life and the little 70
[2:06:58] 80 90 100 years that we have outed
[2:07:01] that's what we prioritize but yet
[2:07:03] eternal life is just around the
[2:07:08] corner what would he profit a man
[2:07:11] through getting the whole world and lose
[2:07:12] his own soul or what would a man give in
[2:07:15] exchange to his own
[2:07:17] soul
