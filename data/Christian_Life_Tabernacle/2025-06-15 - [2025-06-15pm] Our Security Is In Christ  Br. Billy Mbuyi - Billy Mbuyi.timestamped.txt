[19:38] deserves your every breath.
[19:40] Oh, you deserve my every breath.
[19:45] For you paid a great cost. Oh, giving up
[19:51] your life to death. Even death on the
[19:55] cross. Oh, you took all my shame away.

[20:59] sinful heart. Let's sing that second
[21:01] verse again. Sing it with all your
[21:03] heart. Oh, and you deserve my every
[21:08] life. For you paid the great price,
[21:13] giving up your life to death, even death
[21:18] on the cross for you to call my shame
[21:23] away. Bear defeated in my sin. Oh, open
[21:29] up the gates of heaven and have beed.

[30:30] We have no new written requests at this
[30:32] time. We want to remember our pastor as
[30:37] he's out should be making his way back
[30:38] towards the end of this week. Praise be
[30:40] to God. We also want to remember, we've
[30:43] mentioned before, Brother Tommy and
[30:44] Brother Andrew that are out. For all
[30:47] those that are out amongst our midst,
[30:48] those that are at home sick, those that
[30:51] had a desire to make it out here but
[30:53] aren't able to. We believe we just sung
[30:56] about a great God with that same great
[30:58] God could make a way for them to be in
[31:00] the house of the Lord. If you have a
[31:01] need upon your heart and you want to
[31:02] make it known to him by the uplifting of
[31:04] your hands, trust the testimony of your
[31:07] voice. If you confess he's a great God,
[31:09] you'll meet your need. May the brothers
[31:12] that are coming to take the tithes and
[31:13] offerings, please come up.
[31:17] We'll ask brother Benjamin to come and
[31:19] pray for the tithes and the offerings
[31:22] and take the need for
[31:26] [Music]
[31:32] [Music]
[31:36] pray.
[31:38] God Almighty, truly you have a thankful
[31:40] heart, Lord, that at this end time,
[31:43] Lord, as there are listening spirits,
[31:44] Lord, throughout the the land, Lord,
[31:46] that you made a way, Lord, that you
[31:48] provide a way and a pool that for your
[31:50] children, Lord, to be able to be pulled
[31:52] away from this spirit, Lord. So, we
[31:54] thank you for this grace that you
[31:56] provide us, Lord, that we may that we
[31:57] were selected before the foundation of
[31:59] the world, Lord. And we're put aside,
[32:00] Lord, with the world that's been fully
[32:03] revealed to us at this moment, Lord. We
[32:05] give you many thanks for that, Lord. And
[32:07] we don't want to take this for granted,
[32:08] Lord, because we are special people.
[32:10] We're no longer special than the the
[32:12] other people that are outside, Lord. But
[32:14] it was because of grace that we are
[32:16] here, Lord. So we thank you for that,
[32:18] Lord. And we know there's many need in
[32:20] our body, Lord, but you are the God that
[32:22] provided all, Lord. Lord,
[32:25] remembering our brother Jose and his
[32:27] wife, Lord, as they're making their way
[32:28] back, Lord. We thank you for the miracle
[32:31] that you've done in their life, Lord.
[32:32] Truly, it is our brother has been a
[32:34] blessing, Lord. We cannot wait to see
[32:35] him back in this house. Lord, as you
[32:37] sing, Lord, these smiles truly brings
[32:39] happiness, Lord. So we thank you for
[32:41] having, Lord, but that you have healed
[32:43] his wife, Lord. May you bless them where
[32:45] they are, Lord, as they're coming back,
[32:46] Lord. Bless each and every need that's
[32:49] here, Lord. Bless us, Lord, that you are
[32:52] the great El Shadai. Lord, you are the
[32:54] great, you are the presented one, Lord.
[32:56] You said, Lord, your prophet said, Lord,
[32:58] that you are where whatever do we need,
[33:01] Lord. maybe spiritual desire Lord, maybe
[33:03] physical Lord that you are you you will
[33:05] give us strength in each in each of that
[33:07] Lord that we need Lord. So we give you
[33:09] thanks, Lord. And and we ask, Lord, that
[33:11] you may bless our brother that's
[33:13] preparing, Lord, to come here and
[33:14] minister to us, Lord. We are the end
[33:16] time, Lord. It's no longer time to play
[33:18] games. So Lord, we want something strong
[33:20] from you, Lord. We want to feed, Lord.
[33:22] We want to have a word that that can
[33:25] make us take a step further, Lord. So we
[33:27] ask that you may thoroughly use him,
[33:28] Lord, that when he comes here, Lord,
[33:30] cast him aside, Lord, that you may speak
[33:32] to us directly, Lord. We want to walk
[33:33] out of you, Lord, different. We want to
[33:35] walk out of here, Lord, closer to you,
[33:37] Lord. We do not want to remain the same.
[33:38] Lord, we want to advance. Lord, we want
[33:40] as our prophets told, as the prophet
[33:42] said, Lord, it's time to take out take
[33:44] out of here. Lord, we are astronauts.
[33:46] Lord, we do not want to remain in this
[33:48] earth. Lord, we are we are pilgrims,
[33:50] Lord. Lord, we do not want to stay in
[33:53] our camps, Lord. We want to take a step
[33:55] further, Lord. We want to take further,
[33:56] Lord. The wind may blow. Lord, there may
[33:58] be trouble, but we know there's a God
[34:00] that's there, Lord. You are here, Lord.

[36:36] could never contain.

[37:47] to those who believe
[37:50] a fountain of life for others who see.
[38:04] Oh my
[38:08] god.
[38:11] [Music]
[38:21] [Applause]
[38:22] [Music]
[38:31] [Applause]
[38:34] God has been
[38:37] so
[38:39] good.
[38:41] I have been my of the hour.
[38:46] [Music]
[38:49] The hour
[38:51] [Music]
[38:55] is
[39:02] [Music]
[39:07] Yeah. Heat.
[39:19] Heat. Heat.
[39:26] [Music]
[39:40] Heat. Heat.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:54] Oh, so good.
[39:59] I am.
[40:02] Amen. You feel blessed tonight? Amen.
[40:05] Why don't we just bow our heads to him?
[40:07] Gracious father, surely the expression
[40:10] of our mouth cannot express everything,
[40:13] Lord. And father, for all that you do
[40:16] for us, Father, we are such a blessed
[40:19] people, Lord. And father to know that
[40:22] you have chosen us before the foundation
[40:25] of the world and given us the
[40:27] opportunity to view the things that we
[40:29] see. Oh God, Lord, we know within
[40:32] ourselves, Lord, we don't merit any of
[40:34] this. And it's the unmmerited favor of
[40:37] the mighty God. And you came and you
[40:39] chose us and you elected us to be part
[40:42] of the bride. And Lord, we are here just
[40:45] giving you glory and honor and thanking
[40:47] you, Lord. And Father, I believe with
[40:49] all my heart that the song of our life
[40:51] is a song of thanksgiving, Father, if we
[40:54] ever stray from that, we pray you
[40:56] forgive us. But Father, that our
[40:58] footsteps may always claim mercy and
[41:00] grace and love. And Father, because
[41:03] that's the way you brought us in. And it
[41:06] wasn't because of anything we've done.
[41:07] It wasn't because of our knowledge, but
[41:10] you came and you lift us up. and father
[41:12] the desires of our heart that we may
[41:14] extend that same mercy to others to one
[41:17] another that the same God may be
[41:19] manifested in our midst. We just want to
[41:21] commit the few moments that we're going
[41:23] to spend together. Lord we pray that as
[41:26] you spoke to us this morning father come
[41:28] again one more time and father just open
[41:31] your word for just few minutes that we
[41:33] may hear from you and know that God
[41:35] really spoke to us. We commit everything
[41:38] we are and we ask these things in the
[41:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray.
[41:42] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's open
[41:45] our Bibles tonight. Amen. Are you happy
[41:47] to be in the house of God? Amen. We want
[41:49] to continue to remember those that are
[41:51] out as it was said, our pastor and
[41:53] brother Andrew, but Tommy and all of
[41:56] those that are traveling. Let's open to
[41:58] a very familiar scripture reading uh uh
[42:02] Romans 8:28.
[42:09] [Music]
[42:12] Let's start from uh Rom 8:28. It says,
[42:15] "And we know that all things work
[42:16] together for good for them that love
[42:18] God, to them who are called according to
[42:21] his purpose, for whom uh he did know. He
[42:26] also did predestinate to be uh to be
[42:29] conformed
[42:31] to the image of his son that he might be
[42:34] the firstborn among many brethren.
[42:37] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[42:41] he also called. Whom he called them he
[42:43] also justified. Whom he justified them
[42:46] he also glorified.
[42:48] What shall we say then? What shall we
[42:52] then say to these things? If God be for
[42:55] us, who could be against us? We ask the
[42:58] Lord to bless his word. You may have
[43:00] your seats tonight. Amen. I trust you
[43:02] enjoy the word this morning. I I'll tell
[43:04] you this. Um I was just sitting there
[43:06] and um there's just something that
[43:09] struck within my heart as our brother
[43:11] Matthew was preaching. I I want to say
[43:13] this. Uh I'm so glad for the pool. Um,
[43:17] and whatever you want to look at it,
[43:19] whether it be the pull as the message
[43:21] being the pull or the pull in your
[43:22] heart, it all works together. And I want
[43:25] to say this, the pull is really what
[43:28] define those that are here and those
[43:30] that are not here.
[43:32] I I just want to say that from the
[43:34] bottom of my heart. I think it would be
[43:36] a very sad position to be in when the
[43:39] word is preached and there's nothing in
[43:41] your heart that's being pulled. I I I
[43:43] I'm being just as the the the grace of
[43:46] God that we have received is that we can
[43:49] come to the church of God and hear the
[43:51] word of God and there's something inside
[43:53] of your heart that wants to identify
[43:55] with what's being spoken. Why? Because
[43:58] God placed the word in your heart. He
[44:00] placed the seed there. When the word of
[44:02] God is preached is pulling that word and
[44:05] that word is pull and it's pulling and
[44:08] you you desiring what you're hearing.
[44:10] Why? because there's something that
[44:12] wants to identify with the words that's
[44:14] being preached with. Without the pool,
[44:16] we are no different from the guy walking
[44:18] down the street. The pool is really the
[44:21] only thing that makes us different. When
[44:22] he comes, it reveals his word to us.
[44:25] There's a pool inside of our heart that
[44:27] wants to identify. Remember, the end
[44:30] time message was not sent just so we can
[44:32] hear it and get knowledge. It was sent
[44:35] to change and turn the hearts of the
[44:37] children. So the only way the heart can
[44:39] be changed is if there's a pull. If
[44:41] there's something that's working on it.
[44:44] If there's something when you hear the
[44:45] word that says, "Lord, I don't want to
[44:47] be what I'm what what I what what the
[44:49] world is calling me to be. I want to be
[44:52] what the word is calling me to be." So
[44:54] So they had to be an attraction. A pull
[44:57] is an attraction. Something that draws
[44:59] you near. And that's what the Let me say
[45:01] this in the kingdom of God that God
[45:04] doesn't confirm by government.
[45:08] It's not a rule where we come with, hey,
[45:11] you're going to come and and this is the
[45:13] ruler that we're going to measure the
[45:14] skirt and this is how your pants have to
[45:16] look like. No, there is such a thing
[45:19] where we know as the scripture will say
[45:21] in the in the Old Testament that I will
[45:25] give you a heart of flesh. I will take
[45:27] the stony heart and put a new heart in
[45:29] you. But when the word of God is
[45:31] preached, there's a pull inside of your
[45:34] heart that will bring the conversion
[45:36] into your heart. It it doesn't help to
[45:39] bring people and tie them by either fear
[45:42] or whatever it takes. No, what it takes
[45:44] is the word of God to come forth and to
[45:47] create the change that is needed. I
[45:49] don't want to be a hypocrite. I want to
[45:51] be one that's changed by the word of
[45:53] God. And that's the reason why the pool
[45:55] exists. So we can receive the word of
[45:58] God and be changed. So he comes and when
[46:01] the word is preached, let me say this,
[46:03] the end time message is the accumulation
[46:06] of faith.
[46:07] This is the word that was preached since
[46:09] the beginning and it's been accumulated
[46:12] and at the end he reveals the entire
[46:15] word of God so you can receive the
[46:17] original faith.
[46:22] We we're just not like we're not wasting
[46:25] our time here. We here receiving
[46:27] something. We here being pulled by the
[46:29] word. We here getting ready for the
[46:32] rapture. That's around the corner. And
[46:35] and these are the that we have to
[46:37] realize that. So I I thank God for the
[46:39] pull. And I and I want to say this.
[46:41] Every time the word of God is preached,
[46:43] don't be shy. Don't be don't feel don't
[46:46] feel condemned. Feel happy. Know that
[46:48] the word of God is preached to better
[46:50] you. It's not preached to condemn you
[46:52] with the world. is preached so you can
[46:54] be saved. That that that's the purpose
[46:57] why we preach. No, no one is here to to
[47:00] try to condemn others and say, "Oh,
[47:02] you're not a Christian. You're not."
[47:04] It's not up to men to decide that. God's
[47:06] decide that. But the word of God is
[47:09] preached so you can receive it in your
[47:11] heart. So you know the instruction that
[47:13] is given so something inside of your
[47:15] heart can identify with what's being
[47:17] preached and you could be changed. I I
[47:20] just want to for a few moment and as we
[47:23] read the scripture if God be for us who
[47:25] could be against us. I I just want to
[47:28] preach uh and I want to say this not
[47:31] preach speak.
[47:38] We don't have enough time for me to
[47:40] preach so I just speak.
[47:43] Um I I was fellowshipping with brother
[47:46] Matthew on this in the morning and and I
[47:50] I I feel like I was just maybe a little
[47:52] much drawn into it the Israel conflict
[47:55] and and you know I I'll just say this
[47:58] from my own heart just for the few
[48:01] months I I've been so drawn in just the
[48:05] accomplishment of prophecies and the
[48:07] many things that we are seeing my my you
[48:10] know my heart has just been drawn and
[48:12] and and and maybe I spend more time than
[48:15] I should, but you know, that's a
[48:16] different story. But just to see all the
[48:20] turmoils and everything and you every
[48:22] time you turn around, the word of God is
[48:24] bring is coming to pass and and and and
[48:29] the word of God is coming to pass. And
[48:31] then you you your your heart is is is
[48:34] wanting to make sure that you're ready
[48:35] and everything that you do. I I don't
[48:37] want to miss it. I don't want to be
[48:38] caught doing something that I'm not
[48:40] supposed to do and everything and and
[48:43] but but yet you find that in this very
[48:46] time where the heart is supposed to be
[48:48] on fire you see some cooling and and so
[48:51] then as you read the word because you
[48:55] understand the word is given to us but
[48:57] says as ministers we we we see things
[49:00] and we have to go into the word of God
[49:02] so we can bring it to the people and and
[49:04] so within your own heart you you you
[49:07] want to make sure that there's an
[49:09] awareness that when when these things
[49:11] happen that there's also a promise
[49:13] that's promised to the bride that we
[49:16] should be in a certain state where our
[49:18] hearts are getting on fire where we know
[49:20] that we are almost at the end that the
[49:22] the the we we not guarantee this is
[49:25] going to go long. We are at the very end
[49:27] that we could be that we need to do all
[49:30] that we know to be prepared for the
[49:32] rapture that's coming and the rapture
[49:34] that's around the corner. So, I was
[49:36] looking into this and and and and if you
[49:40] got a chance to listen to it, it it it
[49:42] was such a um something that was just
[49:48] unexpected.
[49:49] There is no word to to explain. Uh
[49:52] because Israel has been wanting to
[49:54] attack Iran for the longest and and and
[49:57] and no president, American president
[49:59] would allow them to do that. You know,
[50:01] all the president, no, you can't do
[50:03] that. You can't do that. we're going to
[50:04] go and and and and I thought this was
[50:08] the greatest deception that's ever been
[50:10] created. Iran was in the middle of
[50:14] negotiating the nuclear deal, if you
[50:17] know, and they had sequences of meeting.
[50:19] They had one more meeting left in order
[50:22] for them to finalize
[50:25] what the agreement was supposed to be.
[50:28] and and I and and I thought maybe you
[50:32] know they went they were skeptical on
[50:33] the first meeting second and whatever.
[50:36] So they were preparing for this meeting
[50:38] so they can come and say this is what
[50:40] the you know final statute is going to
[50:42] look like this is what we can agree and
[50:44] everything and it's at that time that
[50:47] they get hit
[50:50] and and it was so orchestrated if you
[50:53] hear I this is probably for the history
[50:55] books 200 planes going in and out and
[50:59] you got to measure the distance passing
[51:02] over you know countries in and Syria and
[51:04] Jordan and going back and forth and and
[51:08] destroying the infrastructure,
[51:10] destroying the nuclear and and and and
[51:13] all of the the the the the the
[51:16] uh Iran is known to be part as part of
[51:19] the Middle East and there is no country
[51:21] that has more ballistic than Iran.
[51:25] So you can really see that this was and
[51:28] and this will be studied maybe for many
[51:31] years. How did they pull this off?
[51:34] because he was so orchestrated and I
[51:37] thought I said they I mean you you can't
[51:40] prepare for this. You can't you can't
[51:42] secure yourself for this. This this
[51:44] shows you that when they call for peace
[51:46] there's a certain distraction that's
[51:48] coming
[51:51] and you look and and I've just began to
[51:53] think in my heart and this this title
[51:56] just came to my heart that I want to
[51:57] speak for just few minute. Our security
[52:00] is in Christ. Amen. Our security is in
[52:04] Christ. And and I just want to say this,
[52:06] we we do a lot of things to to protect
[52:10] ourselves, to secure ourselves. And you
[52:12] know, whether it be in relationship, in
[52:14] finance, in health, in work, and you
[52:17] know, we go to school so we can secure a
[52:19] good job. And you know, we work hard and
[52:22] you're trying to make some money so you
[52:23] can buy a house in a good neighborhood.
[52:26] And you do all that you can and you do.
[52:28] And I want to say this, all of those
[52:30] things are good, but our true security
[52:32] only lies in the word of God.
[52:37] That they that we we can try all that we
[52:39] can. We we we try to save some money in
[52:41] the bank and, you know, we we we can try
[52:44] to put our kids in the best school that
[52:46] we can afford and we can try to put an
[52:48] alarm system in our houses and and try
[52:52] to to get signals when something
[52:54] happened. But let me say this. Ezra
[52:56] scripture will say that except the Lord
[52:58] builds a house, they that build it build
[53:01] it in vain. Except the Lord keepeth the
[53:04] city, they that watch, they watch in
[53:07] vain. The Lord is our true protector.
[53:10] The the let me say this, the the our
[53:13] security is not in the multitude of the
[53:15] actions that we take. It it's not in our
[53:19] protection or what we can do. Our true
[53:21] sense of security lies in the word of
[53:24] torments that we have received.
[53:28] And and and let me say this, the world
[53:30] is in the brink of war. Now that this
[53:33] has happened, you know, United States is
[53:35] already over there helping with all the
[53:38] projectile that Iran is sending about a
[53:40] thousand a day trying to help Israel
[53:42] because they're trying to overwhelm all
[53:44] the systems, all the the the the uh Iron
[53:47] Dome, the the the the
[53:50] I believe it's David Sling and the
[53:51] Patriot missile. They have all of those
[53:54] things to protect. But even those, as
[53:56] brother Matthew said, they're not
[53:57] enough. The true security of any nation,
[54:01] of any people, and every group is the
[54:03] word of promise. That's why it's not
[54:06] time to to waste time and said, "Oh, I
[54:08] got to go get that." The devil is the
[54:10] master in destruction. He wants to get
[54:13] you distracted where you can worry about
[54:16] this, worry about this. And in that
[54:18] time, he's working his deal and he's
[54:20] working things so he can destroy you.
[54:22] Our true protection and our true
[54:24] watchman is when we look at the word of
[54:27] God and we prepare oursel against what
[54:30] the word of God ask us to do. That let
[54:32] me say this. We've said this before. The
[54:35] true protection of Israel has never been
[54:38] with the arms or the gain or the the the
[54:40] arms or everything that they can do.
[54:42] It's all been that God has given them a
[54:44] promise and by the promise they are
[54:46] protected. Hallelujah.
[54:50] We we look security in our jobs. We look
[54:52] security in in in everything that we do.
[54:55] But our greatest security is the fact
[54:57] that we are in Christ. The scripture
[54:59] says that heaven and earth will pass
[55:01] away. But my word, let me say this. When
[55:04] he says heaven, heaven and earth will
[55:06] pass away, it's the building, it's the
[55:09] mortar, it's the cosmos, it's men
[55:11] thinking. Everything that you see with
[55:13] your eyes that's man-made will pass
[55:15] away. It it doesn't matter how great or
[55:19] or how great an invention or or a a car
[55:23] was an airplane is or AI or whatever you
[55:26] want to call it. All of those invention
[55:28] will pass away. All of those invention
[55:31] are we're going to fail. The only thing
[55:33] that will stay is what was promised.
[55:36] What God spoke will stay that will stay
[55:39] forever. Amen.
[55:42] Oh my. I was uh thinking and the prophet
[55:46] will speak is I forgot to to if you can
[55:49] find it I forgot to copy the title of
[55:51] the message and he he's now speaking
[55:54] even about God's nature towards man
[55:57] God's way of doing things it says I
[55:59] believe it's in the message preparation
[56:01] I'm not sure it says now preparation God
[56:04] before does anything he always prepared
[56:06] the people for it now we can see he
[56:09] spoke it in the Bible before we could go
[56:12] to height or war. It says we first have
[56:15] to prepare for for that war. If we're
[56:18] going to get married, why you prepare
[56:20] for that time and you prepare and and
[56:23] you have preparation and before you
[56:25] could uh come to church, you made
[56:28] preparation. The ambulance uh uh brings
[56:31] you and the loved ones bring you. It
[56:34] says and you have to get certain amount
[56:36] of money ready before you could you
[56:38] could come. It's a preparation. And God
[56:42] is always God is always prepares the
[56:46] people for the event that's just about
[56:49] to happen.
[56:51] Now he continues on. He says, "And may I
[56:54] stop here just for a minute and say, I
[56:56] believe that the people are in a
[56:58] preparation for the last great
[57:00] distraction this world will ever known.
[57:03] I believe that we are at the end. You
[57:06] can speak to the people. You could put a
[57:08] Billy Graham in every city in United
[57:11] States. You will drink uh it says they
[57:13] will drink whiskey and smoke cigarettes
[57:15] and laugh at you and everything else
[57:18] just the same. It says they are in the
[57:21] spirit of the last day and God cannot
[57:23] send destruction before the people are
[57:26] in the spirit for destruction.
[57:30] Think about it. So the gospel will not
[57:32] do them any good when it's preached. In
[57:35] fact, all it does is create
[57:36] condemnation. All it does is place them
[57:39] into a judgment spot. Why? Because
[57:41] there's no pull in them. Why? Because
[57:44] there's nothing that wants to see the
[57:47] word of God manifested into their life.
[57:49] Why? Because they are there. You can
[57:51] preach all you want. They There's
[57:53] nothing they were not made. There is
[57:56] nothing in them that desires the things
[57:58] of God. And let me say this. He
[58:00] continues on paragraph 185. Oh, this is
[58:04] probably a different message. I'm sorry.
[58:06] He says, "The same God and the same
[58:09] prophet that predicted the word of God."
[58:12] And then it says, "Or the wrath to pour
[58:14] out pour out and told us this coming
[58:17] blessings." I'm so glad. It says God God
[58:22] never does a nation a destruction
[58:24] without a warning. He never gives them
[58:26] He gives them a man. He gives a man a
[58:30] distraction. He never gives men with a
[58:33] distraction without warning first. And
[58:36] now he does that. We have to got
[58:39] something that's happened to us. The
[58:41] vanication of the sign of the last day
[58:44] with us. The great Holy Spirit moving
[58:48] among us and charging the church with
[58:51] his presence, vindicating his word. Then
[58:54] the church is getting ready for a climb
[58:58] into the sky one of these days by the
[59:01] power of God because it's a warning to
[59:05] lay aside every weight and sin that so
[59:08] easily beset us. We might fly with
[59:11] patience. It says that we might that we
[59:14] might fly with patience the raids that's
[59:17] that set before us for the author and
[59:19] the finisher of our faith. So now he's
[59:22] speaking here. The word is in the
[59:24] condition that he is where it's rejected
[59:26] the word. But now he's saying but
[59:28] there's a people that God has given a
[59:30] blessing to. They've seen the
[59:32] vindication of the word of God. They've
[59:34] seen the word of God come to pass. And
[59:37] those people are preparing so they can
[59:39] fly into the sky. Those people they have
[59:42] received that word and that word is sent
[59:45] to them for the for the sake of
[59:47] preparing them for the event that's to
[59:49] come. Let me say this my brother my my
[59:51] sister rapture is not a story. Rapture
[59:54] is a reality. Rapture is here already.
[59:59] Rapture is the end time message that you
[1:00:01] have received. Rapture is a pulling in
[1:00:04] your heart that's preparing you every
[1:00:06] day and one of this moment you won't be
[1:00:08] here.
[1:00:11] Rapture is not an event where you walk
[1:00:13] up and then things happen. No. Rapture
[1:00:15] has been on earth since the prophet
[1:00:18] showed up. Why? Because if there's going
[1:00:20] to be an event, then there has to be a
[1:00:22] people prepared for that event.
[1:00:28] It's not time for us to relax. It's the
[1:00:30] time where we need to be found into the
[1:00:33] father's business. We need to be found
[1:00:35] doing the things that God called us to
[1:00:38] do. If you are called to be a housewife,
[1:00:40] you do housewife things. Wherever you
[1:00:42] are, you are the representation of the
[1:00:45] word. Why? Because the word has to be
[1:00:47] represented in every person, in
[1:00:50] everywhere you go, in every schools, in
[1:00:52] every district, in every place, whatever
[1:00:55] you do, you are the word of God
[1:00:57] manifested for that place.
[1:01:02] So he sends warning and and and so God
[1:01:05] is preparing his elected one. And and I
[1:01:08] want to say this and it doesn't matter.
[1:01:11] Many will come and and and will say,
[1:01:13] "Well, I don't know if I'm prepared. Let
[1:01:15] me say this. The preparation is not done
[1:01:18] by you. The preparation is done by the
[1:01:20] word that you have received. You just
[1:01:23] make sure you believe and you stay with
[1:01:25] what's given to you. The word will
[1:01:27] prepare you. Amen. God calls for
[1:01:30] holiness. You can produce holiness if
[1:01:33] you wanted to.
[1:01:38] We we we we we measure ourselves. We
[1:01:42] weigh ourselves in the balance against
[1:01:44] ourselves. and the results are no good.
[1:01:48] The if God calls for righteousness, God
[1:01:51] will produce righteousness. If God calls
[1:01:54] for holiness, God will produce holiness.
[1:01:56] If God calls for rapture, God will
[1:01:58] produce the rapture. So what you and I
[1:02:00] need to do is to believe the word that
[1:02:03] we have received. Is to stay with the
[1:02:05] word that we have received and let the
[1:02:07] word produce what God requires out of
[1:02:10] us.
[1:02:16] Oh my. So, so he's building and and
[1:02:23] it will take him and
[1:02:26] whatever question you have for him to
[1:02:28] bring the answer. But when I'm say that
[1:02:31] God is his own interpreter,
[1:02:34] if we have received the word of God and
[1:02:37] we are the word of God, then God has to
[1:02:41] do the interpretation.
[1:02:43] If he interprets the written letter, he
[1:02:46] has to interpret himself in your life.
[1:02:48] So you would know who he is. And the
[1:02:51] interpretation is not bound to be the
[1:02:53] same, but it will produce the same
[1:02:55] result
[1:02:56] because it's the same God. The scripture
[1:02:59] as we read in in Romans uh uh 8 and 31
[1:03:04] it will say but if God be for us who can
[1:03:07] be against us my brother my sister God
[1:03:10] is not against us God is for us.
[1:03:15] We you we we didn't come to church as
[1:03:17] enemies of God. We came to church as
[1:03:20] children of God. And and Paul is here
[1:03:23] speaking. He says if God be for us who
[1:03:26] can be against us? And let me say this,
[1:03:28] the Satan is the one who tried to drive
[1:03:30] a wedge between you and God. Point out
[1:03:32] all your mistakes. So you all your un
[1:03:35] unbelief and all that you can and cannot
[1:03:38] do. But let me say this, the word of God
[1:03:40] that you have received will produce what
[1:03:42] God wants to produce in you. God is not
[1:03:45] against you. God is for you. What he
[1:03:48] desires out of you is for you to receive
[1:03:50] his word so you can receive what he's
[1:03:53] asking for. If the word calls for
[1:03:55] salvation, God will provide salvation.
[1:03:58] In fact, the scripture says that God
[1:04:01] gave his only begotten son. Let me ask
[1:04:04] you now, how can somebody be against you
[1:04:06] and give his only begotten son? Amen.
[1:04:10] Now, and when he sent his only begotten
[1:04:12] son, he said that whosoever may shall
[1:04:15] believe that those that will believe
[1:04:18] that he sent his only begotten son. God
[1:04:21] provided a lamb so we could be
[1:04:23] righteous. God provided a lamb so we can
[1:04:26] come to the house of God. God provided a
[1:04:28] lamb so you and I whatever sin we had
[1:04:31] done that he could be forgiven that we
[1:04:34] can come and and worship him in the
[1:04:36] house of God.
[1:04:38] Now if if you go perhaps let me just
[1:04:41] take this as a type in the Old
[1:04:43] Testament. Let me say this. No one was
[1:04:46] was allowed to even enter the temple
[1:04:49] without a sacrifice.
[1:04:53] Let me say this the way said it. No one
[1:04:56] was even allowed to worship without a
[1:04:59] sacrifice.
[1:05:02] You say, "Oh, I just want to worship
[1:05:03] God." No. Without a sacrifice, you are
[1:05:06] not you don't even have access.
[1:05:10] But but God in the Old Testament, he
[1:05:14] provided and and through the blood of
[1:05:16] bulls and goats and men will bring
[1:05:19] animals and and turtle dove and all of
[1:05:21] that and will and will come and and
[1:05:24] through that God will allow them to come
[1:05:27] and worship, will allow them to come and
[1:05:30] lay their hands and their sins will be
[1:05:32] forgiven. We understand that the blood
[1:05:35] didn't have the power. The blood of the
[1:05:37] animal didn't have the power to change
[1:05:39] the nature. But yet through all of that,
[1:05:41] because it was the word of God that was
[1:05:43] given to them that provided them access
[1:05:46] into the temple. My brother, my sister,
[1:05:48] Jesus died so we can have access to God.
[1:05:53] We we had that was just a type. But
[1:05:56] Jesus came he came so he can die for the
[1:05:59] sin of the whole world. He came and he
[1:06:02] that's why said that there's only one
[1:06:04] place that God meets a man and that's
[1:06:06] under the shed blood. It doesn't matter
[1:06:09] what you have done. There's one place
[1:06:12] and why am I saying this my brother my
[1:06:15] sister there's no security outside the
[1:06:17] only security is to come under the shed
[1:06:20] blood.
[1:06:22] We we don't want to become religious
[1:06:24] people by understanding. No we want to
[1:06:27] change your heart. We want to turn of
[1:06:29] heart. We want a true conversion. We
[1:06:32] want a true new birth by the word of God
[1:06:35] so we can have access to him.
[1:06:40] It was provided and and our security is
[1:06:43] not even based on our performance.
[1:06:47] Oh, I didn't lie today. I must be close
[1:06:50] to God.
[1:06:52] Really?
[1:06:55] You know, I'm so amazed how
[1:06:57] Jesus when he came to the Pharisees,
[1:07:02] remember it said many stories that they
[1:07:04] could even take a needle and just point
[1:07:06] out every scripture when they p puncture
[1:07:09] the scrolls and they washed their pen
[1:07:12] and pots and they were holy and and in
[1:07:14] fact Jesus looked at them and said,
[1:07:16] "Unless your righteousness exceed of
[1:07:18] those men's." Now, but when Jesus came
[1:07:21] in his head, they presented him the law
[1:07:23] and they said, "As those that obey the
[1:07:26] law and did all the law," he looked at
[1:07:29] him and says, "It is written
[1:07:33] that adultery normally is when a man
[1:07:36] goes with a woman. But I say unto you,
[1:07:38] just by looking,
[1:07:42] I tell you this, there was no man left
[1:07:47] that could stand there." When he told
[1:07:49] them, it says, "Who that has never
[1:07:51] sinned throw the first stone," they were
[1:07:55] reminded of all the words that Jesus
[1:07:57] spoke to them and they knew they were
[1:07:59] just as guilty even though they didn't
[1:08:01] participate in the action.
[1:08:04] And and I'm why am I saying that? You
[1:08:07] can never find righteousness outside of
[1:08:10] the word of God by your own self.
[1:08:14] And I want to say this, you might as
[1:08:15] well take it as a practice. Every time
[1:08:18] you find yourself unrighteous is because
[1:08:20] you judging yourself outside of the word
[1:08:23] of God.
[1:08:25] You say why? The word has called you
[1:08:27] righteous. The word has called you
[1:08:29] clean. The word has called you uh
[1:08:32] elected. The word, in other word, when
[1:08:34] you look at yourself, your nature, your
[1:08:37] natural, you will find those things. But
[1:08:39] if you consider what price has been paid
[1:08:41] for you, God didn't pay the price so you
[1:08:44] can continue to remain in sin. No, he
[1:08:47] paid a price so you can be converted and
[1:08:50] changed and your heart changed. Let me
[1:08:53] say this. As soon as your your your
[1:08:55] nature change, everything is done.
[1:08:59] You you may say, "Well, I I I I still
[1:09:02] find myself falling into this." Don't
[1:09:04] worry about that because it doesn't that
[1:09:06] nature that change you, that nature will
[1:09:08] take care of everything else. The Bible
[1:09:11] said many people will come, oh, I don't
[1:09:12] go to church. Oh, I want to stop
[1:09:14] smoking. I want to do this. They said,
[1:09:15] "No, that's not the way to do it." Then
[1:09:18] if you stop smoking, it's by own
[1:09:19] strength. You come to God and let him
[1:09:22] take away the cigarette.
[1:09:24] Oh, I still do this. You got to him. Let
[1:09:27] me say this. Our security is only in
[1:09:30] Christ. Whatever you find yourself,
[1:09:33] whatever you struggle with, whatever you
[1:09:35] find yourself in, you go into Christ.
[1:09:38] Amen. Outside of Christ, we are nothing.
[1:09:41] In Christ, we have everything.
[1:09:44] Yes,
[1:09:46] you are justified and declared
[1:09:48] righteous. Who shall bring any charge to
[1:09:51] God's elect? It's God who justified him.
[1:09:55] Jesus interceded for us all. Our defense
[1:09:59] attorney, as we heard it this morning,
[1:10:01] no accusation can stick to those that
[1:10:04] are in Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:10:09] Think about it.
[1:10:10] No accusation will stand for those that
[1:10:14] are in Christ.
[1:10:16] It says, "Who shall separate us from the
[1:10:19] love
[1:10:21] that is in Christ?" For the love of God
[1:10:24] that is in Christ,
[1:10:27] he asked a question. It says, "Shall
[1:10:29] tribulation,
[1:10:31] distress, persecution, what is it
[1:10:34] showing? There is nothing that would
[1:10:38] separate those that are elected from the
[1:10:41] one who elected them.
[1:10:44] There is nothing that would separate no
[1:10:47] death, no angels, no demon, no future,
[1:10:51] no past, nothing. We are more than
[1:10:54] conqueror through Jesus.
[1:10:56] and and and people will come and and
[1:10:59] form a false sense of security and and
[1:11:01] they'll come and they think it's by the
[1:11:03] obedience by men trying to do things
[1:11:06] that they can obtain righteousness. But
[1:11:08] when says your righteousness is filthy
[1:11:10] rag, the only righteousness we have is
[1:11:13] through Christ. The only uh uh thing
[1:11:16] that we can claim is that God has
[1:11:18] changed us. We can come here and know
[1:11:20] that I'm not what I used to be. I'm not
[1:11:22] what I wanted to be. I am what God wants
[1:11:25] me to be today. I've been I can know
[1:11:28] that what what I am today, what you see
[1:11:30] today, it's not a result of my own work.
[1:11:34] It's the work of God that made you who
[1:11:36] you are.
[1:11:39] But when we say we'll speak about man's
[1:11:43] deception and it says and and the time
[1:11:46] that we are living in, it says we are at
[1:11:48] the end time. Something's taking place.
[1:11:50] I believe this is uh God keeps his word
[1:11:53] paragraph 54. This is preaching 57047.
[1:11:57] He says God keeps his word. Some's
[1:12:00] taking place.
[1:12:05] Some's taking place. And he says there's
[1:12:08] no way to stop it. There's no way.
[1:12:10] There's only one way out of it and
[1:12:13] that's up.
[1:12:17] Oh my. I'm so glad. There's no way out
[1:12:21] of it. The only way is up. You say, "Oh,
[1:12:26] I'm Switzerland. I don't go to war. I'm
[1:12:28] peaceful." Uh-uh. The only way out of it
[1:12:32] is up. Oh, I I'm going to go in some
[1:12:35] remote country in Africa or go hide
[1:12:38] under a stone in Madagascar. No. The
[1:12:42] only way out of it is up.
[1:12:47] The only way out of it is up. It says,
[1:12:51] it says there's no way of trying to
[1:12:53] hide. There is no hiding place but one.
[1:12:58] It says as a little girl used to sing
[1:13:00] here. We just uh we just as a boy
[1:13:03] preacher, we used to sing. It says
[1:13:05] there's no hiding place down here. I
[1:13:07] went to the rock to hide my face, but
[1:13:10] the rock cried out. There's no hiding
[1:13:12] place down here. But there's only they
[1:13:14] uh there is a hiding place. The name of
[1:13:17] the Lord is the mighty tower. The
[1:13:20] righteous run into it and they are
[1:13:21] saved. How glad we are to have this
[1:13:24] hiding place at the end time.
[1:13:29] I I love it as was preaching. We should
[1:13:32] be the one dancing everywhere we go. You
[1:13:35] know when people are talking about the
[1:13:37] the calamity and the things that's
[1:13:39] happening, you just over there saying,
[1:13:40] "Thank God. I know there's a hiding
[1:13:42] place. Thank God I know there's a hiding
[1:13:44] place. When you get fired at a job,
[1:13:47] thank God I know there's a hiding place.
[1:13:49] When there's no money to foot, there I
[1:13:51] know there's a hiding place. When
[1:13:53] trouble comes your way, thank God I know
[1:13:55] whether be sickness or whatever it is.
[1:13:58] Let me say it. It will end. The only
[1:14:01] thing that won't end is the word of God.
[1:14:06] We have a hiding place. We're not left
[1:14:09] just alone to debate. We are here with
[1:14:12] the word of God has been given to us.
[1:14:16] Let me skip for the take of time sake of
[1:14:18] time. I believe the same message. Let me
[1:14:20] drop to paragraph 56. It says, "Brother,
[1:14:24] we we've weighed a a a past of borders
[1:14:27] and mercies until there's nothing left
[1:14:30] but but judgment, but the righteous will
[1:14:33] not have to be punished with the
[1:14:35] unrighteous. God will come and Jesus
[1:14:38] will redeem his church. It says and
[1:14:41] we'll go up in the air to meet him. It
[1:14:45] says it will be far beyond any bomb, any
[1:14:49] trouble. It'll be uh it will it says and
[1:14:52] it will be protected during that time.
[1:14:55] Will be protected during that time. So
[1:14:57] children back to your back to your God
[1:15:01] quickly. Don't tangle with the world and
[1:15:04] or for anything. Stay out of the modern
[1:15:07] world. Stay out of the modern theology.
[1:15:10] Just look to the lamb. Let the lamb of
[1:15:13] God. Read your Bible and pray all the
[1:15:15] time. Don't worry. Be rejoicing and
[1:15:17] happy for your redemption of the church
[1:15:19] draw it nigh. We shall see him who died
[1:15:23] for us.
[1:15:25] It It's that time that we live in. My
[1:15:28] brother, my sister, we have been running
[1:15:30] for a long time. We have been waiting
[1:15:32] for this moment a long time. I'm telling
[1:15:35] you, when we get to the end, it's not
[1:15:37] time to be sad. It's the time to be
[1:15:39] rejoicing.
[1:15:43] Since the beginning of man, we've been
[1:15:46] waiting for this time when it finally
[1:15:48] all will be over. The first age came,
[1:15:51] the second church, the third, the
[1:15:53] fourth, and the fifth, and the seventh
[1:15:55] came. Oh my. But there's a promise that
[1:15:58] there's not going to be an eighth age.
[1:16:00] That we are standing on the brink of the
[1:16:02] end where all things will be made new.
[1:16:05] He says, "Behold, I've made all things
[1:16:07] new."
[1:16:12] He says, "When you see these things,
[1:16:14] look up for your redemption
[1:16:18] drawth nigh."
[1:16:22] These are comforting words to the
[1:16:24] believer.
[1:16:26] There's only one hiding place and that
[1:16:29] is in Christ. Amen. In the message El
[1:16:32] Shari paragraph 46 it says
[1:16:36] look it could happen any time. There's
[1:16:39] not one thing left the come that the
[1:16:41] coming of the Lord is at hand. We see in
[1:16:44] the hangers of Rashra and all different
[1:16:47] worlds bomb and the things that were
[1:16:49] destroyed the complete destroyed the in
[1:16:52] uh the world in a snap. The world could
[1:16:56] could not stand it. And before it takes
[1:16:59] place, the church is going to glory.
[1:17:03] No tribulation. Uhuh. Uhuh.
[1:17:06] No. There are people that are candidate
[1:17:09] for the rapture. And I believe I'm
[1:17:11] looking at them. Candidate for the
[1:17:14] rapture. How did you get in it? I've
[1:17:16] been elected as member of it. It wasn't
[1:17:19] by my righteousness. It wasn't by my No.
[1:17:22] Oh, somehow God opened my eyes to see
[1:17:24] it. How did I know? I wasn't looking for
[1:17:28] it. I wasn't searching for it. He came
[1:17:31] and he brought me out of sin. He sent a
[1:17:33] prophet messenger. He opened my eyes to
[1:17:36] it. All of the sudden, he told me, "I'm
[1:17:38] not only stopping you. I'm taking you
[1:17:40] into the rapture." And I believe him.
[1:17:48] Remember, before any rain ever falls,
[1:17:53] Noah was in the ark safely.
[1:17:56] It says, "Before any fire ever fell, the
[1:17:59] angel said to Lot, get the hands, get
[1:18:02] out of here, cuz I could do nothing
[1:18:05] until I've gone. I've done I've gone
[1:18:08] hands got away from here." church going
[1:18:12] out before the destruction comes and the
[1:18:15] sc it says and the scientist world says
[1:18:18] there's three minutes until midnight.
[1:18:21] The clock is ticking away all the time.
[1:18:25] Eternity is existing. Eternity is is
[1:18:28] fixing to set in. The world knows
[1:18:31] science science world knows said it
[1:18:34] would scare the people to death.
[1:18:44] It says now, let me just finish it up.
[1:18:46] It says
[1:18:49] you've heard and and I'll put it out and
[1:18:52] it's put it out on radio. We know the
[1:18:54] time that the time is at hand. And if we
[1:18:56] can happen before the morning, the
[1:18:58] church is gone. The church goes before
[1:19:01] that happen. How close how close is the
[1:19:05] coming of Christ? Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:07] Brother, I'll tell you, you can't dig
[1:19:10] you can't dig deep enough to hide from
[1:19:13] one them bombs.
[1:19:16] They will blow a hole to the ground.
[1:19:18] Now, you know, they call him bunker
[1:19:21] buster.
[1:19:26] I don't know if this is a quote, but
[1:19:27] there's another one, but one of them
[1:19:28] says it says, well, I mean, let's say
[1:19:30] you can dig 200 ft down, and you know,
[1:19:32] he says just the very vibration will
[1:19:35] kill you.
[1:19:38] vibration.
[1:19:42] I mean, no, let me say you survived.
[1:19:47] Who else is left with you?
[1:19:52] I mean, this is serious. I mean, it's
[1:19:54] like, why? Why? Why make the provision
[1:19:57] to stay?
[1:19:59] Why? Why make the provision to say? Why
[1:20:02] make provision to suffer when a free
[1:20:05] gift of God has been given? When a whole
[1:20:08] table is full. When we can come and
[1:20:10] rejoice. When we've been given the
[1:20:12] opportunity. My brother, my sister, run
[1:20:14] for the opportunity that's given.
[1:20:19] Hallelujah.
[1:20:22] He says, I said I was not going to
[1:20:25] preach.
[1:20:27] I'm sorry.
[1:20:34] This place says that
[1:20:40] it says it'll blow a hole in the ground
[1:20:42] for
[1:20:44] 150 miles.
[1:20:48] 200 ft deep.
[1:20:51] He says, "How are you going to get down
[1:20:53] there?" If you build an iron cage
[1:20:57] or build or or building 500 ft deep, the
[1:21:01] concussion would break every bone of
[1:21:05] your body.
[1:21:07] It's got such a if you if it got such a
[1:21:10] place, there's no hiding place down
[1:21:12] here. You could cry you could cry to the
[1:21:15] rock, but it will tell you there's a
[1:21:17] bomb shelter. But it says, "But I'm
[1:21:20] telling you, there's a bomb shelter at
[1:21:23] uh there's a bomb shelter at that. I've
[1:21:26] made out it's it says it's made out of
[1:21:28] feathers under his wings." Amen. There's
[1:21:32] a shelter, the everlasting shelter in
[1:21:35] glory. That's the place of refuge, the
[1:21:38] place to flee to
[1:21:42] feathers.
[1:21:46] That's insane.
[1:21:48] But with faith, it's possible.
[1:21:52] I'll fly away.
[1:21:54] I'll fly away. My David said in Psalm 91
[1:21:59] and when he says, "He that dwelleth in
[1:22:02] the secret place of the most high shall
[1:22:05] abide under the shadow of the my
[1:22:07] almighty. I will say unto the Lord, he
[1:22:10] is my refuge and my fortress, my God. In
[1:22:14] him will I trust. Surely he shall
[1:22:16] deliver thee from the the snares and the
[1:22:19] the the files and from the noise
[1:22:22] pestilence. He shall cover thee up with
[1:22:24] his feathers.
[1:22:27] Not iron feathers.
[1:22:30] Feathers.
[1:22:33] Now think about it. You know God has a
[1:22:36] way to do things. Yes sir. Very very
[1:22:38] paradoxal. He's made it to where the
[1:22:41] unbeliever cannot believe it.
[1:22:45] When the unbelievers hear it, it's like,
[1:22:48] you must be going out of your mind.
[1:22:51] The make believers will look at you and
[1:22:52] just decide to make anything he wants
[1:22:55] out of it. But yet the believers will
[1:22:57] hear it and say, "Praise God. It's just
[1:23:00] I all I need is feathers. All I need is
[1:23:02] just for him to give me full feathers
[1:23:04] and I'll fly away out of here."
[1:23:07] Amen. And let me say this, but but when
[1:23:10] I preach a message, the believer's
[1:23:12] position in Christ, oh my, I I said I
[1:23:15] don't have time to go through this. Our
[1:23:17] position is in Christ. Our hiding place
[1:23:21] is in Christ. Our security is in PL is
[1:23:24] in Christ. But Rom says that we have
[1:23:27] been elected and chosen to be in Christ.
[1:23:30] It says, how do you get in there? By one
[1:23:33] baptism.
[1:23:35] It it it's not by conversion. It's not
[1:23:37] by education. That's why when we preach
[1:23:39] this word of God, perhaps we say it, you
[1:23:42] know, you say, "Oh, you guys say it too
[1:23:43] much." We say it so you can know it.
[1:23:46] It's not a place where you come by
[1:23:48] education, where because your parents
[1:23:50] come. No, it's you knowing God for
[1:23:52] yourself. Come to a place where your
[1:23:55] nature have been changed, your desires
[1:23:57] have been changed, where you live for
[1:23:59] him, and where you know that he's your
[1:24:01] hiding place, and where you know that
[1:24:03] he's the one that saves you, where you
[1:24:05] have something in your heart that's
[1:24:07] beating for him, where you feel the pull
[1:24:10] in your heart.
[1:24:13] And he speaks, he says,
[1:24:16] he speaks, he says our identity is not
[1:24:19] in the things that we find around us.
[1:24:22] speaking to the believer's position in
[1:24:25] Christ. He speaks on and it says we we
[1:24:28] come and he says uh if I could just turn
[1:24:30] there. I'm sorry. Let me just turn there
[1:24:32] so I don't uh uh speak too much here and
[1:24:35] and and and get to what I'm trying to
[1:24:37] get to. So he speaks and this is uh in
[1:24:39] in uh Ephesians chapter 1 and we know it
[1:24:42] very well. Now remember uh it just says
[1:24:45] a background before I can go quickly
[1:24:48] that the Ephesians the Ephesian book is
[1:24:51] equals to Joshua. It's the same. Now
[1:24:54] remember what was Joshua's mission?
[1:24:56] Joshua's mission was to divide the land
[1:24:59] of promise that was already given. Now
[1:25:02] remember Joshua's job was the division
[1:25:05] of the land. But the land was a
[1:25:07] predestinated land because Joshua didn't
[1:25:10] give the name. What Joshua did, he gave
[1:25:13] places based on names. But the names
[1:25:16] were given by the Hebrew mothers as
[1:25:18] children were born. So as they came to
[1:25:20] earth that the mothers gave the name and
[1:25:23] the name identify them to a certain
[1:25:25] place to something that they were
[1:25:27] supposed to do. So is the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:30] the end time. When the Holy Ghost comes
[1:25:32] upon you is so he can bring you in the
[1:25:35] predestinated condition that God wants
[1:25:38] you to be from the beginning. Yes.
[1:25:42] That's why when we even talk about the
[1:25:44] new birth and and forgive me for this,
[1:25:46] the new birth is not changing you into
[1:25:49] something that you never been.
[1:25:53] Now, that's the message of the hour.
[1:25:56] The new birth is to bring you into the
[1:26:00] original condition that God when he
[1:26:03] thought about you, what he wanted you to
[1:26:05] be, not what the devil made out of you,
[1:26:08] not what you came from for from sin and
[1:26:11] the way that you came through. The new
[1:26:13] birth is the identification to the
[1:26:15] original you.
[1:26:21] So he he speaks he says now let me just
[1:26:24] skip some.
[1:26:26] He says grace be to you and peace from
[1:26:29] God our father. He says blessed be the
[1:26:32] God and the father of our lord Jesus
[1:26:34] Christ who had uh who had blessed us
[1:26:37] with all spiritual blessings in the
[1:26:39] heavenly places.
[1:26:42] All
[1:26:44] not some.
[1:26:46] The entire word of God being revealed to
[1:26:50] you. The entire book, not a partial book
[1:26:53] anymore. The entire land belonging to
[1:26:56] you. Not physically, spiritually.
[1:27:01] Think about that. He's made known unto
[1:27:04] you all. It's a spiritual blessings that
[1:27:06] he's made according as he has chosen as
[1:27:09] in him before the foundation of the
[1:27:11] world. that we should be holy without
[1:27:13] blame for him in love. He says, "Having
[1:27:17] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:27:19] children by Christ to him according to
[1:27:23] the good pleasure of his will."
[1:27:27] If I will never finish.
[1:27:31] We are predestinated people.
[1:27:34] We we we I think we we tend to forget
[1:27:37] that a lot. the the the the Satan wants
[1:27:40] to brainwash you into thinking you you
[1:27:45] you are born of these parents, natural
[1:27:47] parents, and and and follow the your
[1:27:50] lineage. Go take a DNA test and find out
[1:27:52] who your great great great grandparents
[1:27:54] were and then you know find out what
[1:27:56] they did and do the same thing
[1:28:01] or you you came from this country or
[1:28:03] that country. You have a greater purpose
[1:28:06] than that. and and and the what the the
[1:28:09] word of God at the end time. That's why
[1:28:11] I you could call me a fanatic that you
[1:28:14] want when when you could take it all the
[1:28:16] way from the beginning. Oh, they came
[1:28:18] and they were justified. They were happy
[1:28:20] for their justification and that was
[1:28:22] wonderful. They knew they were sinners
[1:28:24] that there was justification. Once they
[1:28:26] confessed their sin, they were
[1:28:28] justified. That's wonderful. That worked
[1:28:30] for that age. Sanctification came. They
[1:28:32] receive understand that in order for the
[1:28:34] Holy Spirit to come, they had to be set
[1:28:37] aside for service. They had to be clean
[1:28:39] vessel that God was going to use. That's
[1:28:41] wonderful. But I want to say this, all
[1:28:43] of that was still from a man's
[1:28:45] perspective. They came in, in fact, the
[1:28:47] Holy Spirit came. They were renewed with
[1:28:50] power from above. They did great signs
[1:28:52] and wonders and everything. But yet,
[1:28:54] there was still that the Paul speaks
[1:28:57] about when I do good, evil is present
[1:28:59] with me and everything. But the prophet
[1:29:01] comes at the end time. He's now not
[1:29:04] looking at you from the man's
[1:29:05] perspective. He's looking at you from
[1:29:07] God's perspective.
[1:29:09] Amen.
[1:29:11] And let me say this, if you if you ever
[1:29:15] going to win and become an overcomer,
[1:29:18] you have to look at yourself exactly as
[1:29:20] the prophet described it. Amen.
[1:29:25] Because the anytime you attach any main
[1:29:28] spot to it, you will always the devil
[1:29:30] will always find a way to defeat you.
[1:29:33] But if you look at it from God's
[1:29:35] perspective, the only reason I'm here is
[1:29:37] because I was with him from the
[1:29:39] beginning.
[1:29:41] I love it how the prophet was standing.
[1:29:43] He's describing God in the beginning. He
[1:29:46] was alone. He was with his attributes.
[1:29:48] He says, "Let there be." And he stops
[1:29:50] right there. It says now when he was in
[1:29:52] that form you were in him.
[1:29:56] Now why is he doing? He's giving you a
[1:29:59] weapon and overcomer. It doesn't matter
[1:30:01] what the devil does with his flesh. You
[1:30:04] are not the flesh. You are what was with
[1:30:06] God in the beginning.
[1:30:15] So he comes and now listen to this he's
[1:30:18] speaking and the scripture will speak
[1:30:20] it's our position in Christ
[1:30:24] it's our position in Christ we he
[1:30:27] doesn't want you to to get stuck into
[1:30:31] the identification of who you are in the
[1:30:34] flesh he wants you to know that your
[1:30:37] victory is in him. Your salvation is in
[1:30:40] him. Everything that you are is in him.
[1:30:43] Your, in other words, let me say this.
[1:30:46] Every time you are in Christ, you are
[1:30:48] victorious. Outside of Christ, you're
[1:30:50] just looking at this back of bones.
[1:30:52] Never forget that. And so when you take
[1:30:55] yourself, consider yourself always in
[1:30:58] Christ. How do you get there? By the new
[1:31:00] birth. He's birthed you. So you can get
[1:31:03] in there and consider yourself in
[1:31:05] Christ. The scripture will say in 2
[1:31:07] Corinthians 5:17, it says, "Therefore,
[1:31:10] if any man is in be in Christ, he is a
[1:31:13] new creature."
[1:31:16] Oh, I love that.
[1:31:21] But Ram says it's not the old you. God
[1:31:25] is fixing it up. It says, "Oh, I know
[1:31:28] Benoir, he's got some good things in
[1:31:30] him. you know, if he comes to Christ,
[1:31:32] we'll just patch him up and, you know,
[1:31:35] take out the bad things. No, it's a new
[1:31:37] creation. This is not the old creation.
[1:31:41] This is a new creation that came by
[1:31:43] Jesus Christ. This is I want you to
[1:31:46] think about the virgin birth. The devil
[1:31:48] come and mess up all that God was doing.
[1:31:51] God said, "I'm going to start a new. I'm
[1:31:53] going to create a new creation, and this
[1:31:56] creation will not come by man. It will
[1:31:58] be by the spoken word." That's why he
[1:32:01] came at the end time. He says the at the
[1:32:03] end cannot fail.
[1:32:07] Why? Because she's a spoken word virgin
[1:32:10] bride. Why? Because she's word just like
[1:32:15] Jesus was word. Let me say this. If
[1:32:17] Jesus didn't fail, you can't fail.
[1:32:23] You like Jesus? Yeah. The firstborn
[1:32:26] among many brethren, the beginning of
[1:32:28] that creation. Right?
[1:32:33] You're you're not the flesh.
[1:32:37] Don't counting your flesh. The flesh is
[1:32:41] to be brought under subjection by that
[1:32:44] new you that comes by the word of God
[1:32:46] that is supposed to take over this flesh
[1:32:49] and drive it into a place of obedience.
[1:32:55] But it's not you
[1:32:58] trying everything that you can to How
[1:33:01] many here can testify that they had
[1:33:04] something that they were struggling with
[1:33:05] and one day they just woke up it's gone
[1:33:07] away.
[1:33:10] Not by your effort, right? Ah
[1:33:14] that's the new you taking over.
[1:33:17] You think God doesn't know you have
[1:33:19] struggles.
[1:33:21] What he doesn't want you to do is to
[1:33:23] give into those struggles. He wants you
[1:33:26] to stand your ground. He wants you to
[1:33:28] fight. He wants you to know who you are.
[1:33:30] He wants you when you fail, you say,
[1:33:32] "Aba, father." When you fall, you say,
[1:33:34] "Father, I didn't mean to do that." He's
[1:33:36] looking at you. He's looking What is he
[1:33:39] doing it for? For the perfecting of your
[1:33:41] character.
[1:33:43] He knows what's in your heart. He knows
[1:33:45] what you really want to be. No, no, no
[1:33:48] true Christian wants to be a sinner.
[1:33:52] No Christian, no true Christian wants to
[1:33:54] do something to offend Christ. But
[1:33:56] because of the battle in your flesh, the
[1:33:59] enemy will constantly attack you and
[1:34:01] it's for the the real you to put the new
[1:34:04] this this flesh under subtraction by the
[1:34:07] word of God. It says so now he's saying
[1:34:11] it it says now say therefore if a man be
[1:34:15] in Christ is a new creature the old the
[1:34:18] old things have passed away behold all
[1:34:20] things have become new. What is he
[1:34:22] doing? He's giving you a new identity.
[1:34:30] He's saying that if you are in Christ,
[1:34:33] you're no longer the Benoir that we knew
[1:34:36] by the flesh, but you are now the Benoa
[1:34:39] that we know by the spirit. Your your
[1:34:42] nature has changed. Have you ever met
[1:34:45] somebody says, "Man, what happened to
[1:34:47] you? Oh, you used to be this way. Why?
[1:34:49] What happened? You died. That's why
[1:34:52] every day when that old man tried to
[1:34:54] rise up, we kill him. Every day. Not let
[1:34:58] me say this. This man will always try to
[1:35:00] rise every day. You your job is to kill
[1:35:02] him. Your job is to take the word of God
[1:35:05] and shoot him in the head again. Boom.
[1:35:08] Your your is to take what is it called?
[1:35:10] That that two thing holes. What do you
[1:35:12] call that thing? That the gun with two
[1:35:14] holes. A shotgun, right? You just take
[1:35:16] the shotgun and just shoot him again.
[1:35:23] Don't let him live.
[1:35:28] Every time he rises up, you said, "Well,
[1:35:30] I just need to remind you you're dead."
[1:35:32] Boom.
[1:35:35] I just need to remind you it's time to
[1:35:37] die again. Boom.
[1:35:44] In Christ, we have all things. outside
[1:35:47] of Christ, we will be a failure. Let me
[1:35:49] just stop there for the sake time if the
[1:35:52] musician could come. We'll continue
[1:35:54] another time.
[1:35:56] He says in Romans 8 and1, "There is thou
[1:35:59] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:36:02] are in Christ, who walketh not after the
[1:36:04] flesh, but after the spirit." The enemy
[1:36:08] loves to accuse.
[1:36:11] Look at him.
[1:36:13] You know I I you know if you ever wonder
[1:36:16] where this enemy is that just he will
[1:36:18] accuse and you will hear his voice.
[1:36:22] You did this. You in your mind look at
[1:36:24] you. You know oh you know you said this.
[1:36:27] You shouldn't said that. You done this
[1:36:29] you that. I tell you I can't find I I
[1:36:32] it's hard to just go a day without you
[1:36:36] getting accused for something you did.
[1:36:41] If I spend my days listening to him,
[1:36:44] you're going to look crazy because all
[1:36:46] you're going to be doing is debating on
[1:36:48] with him every time. That's why the
[1:36:50] Bible the prophet say read your Bible
[1:36:52] and pray. Why? Because you are leading
[1:36:54] to an inspiration. You need to feed the
[1:36:57] new you. You need to be feeding by the
[1:37:00] word of God and getting through the
[1:37:02] spirit so you can have the strength to
[1:37:04] overcome.
[1:37:08] If you are in him,
[1:37:11] you're not guilty. Why? Because he paid
[1:37:14] for your sins. If you are in him, you
[1:37:17] under the grace of God. You don't walk
[1:37:20] in fear of judgment.
[1:37:22] Oh, if I do this, God is going to punish
[1:37:24] me. If you are at that stage, you need a
[1:37:28] better relationship.
[1:37:30] We do what we do because we love him.
[1:37:33] It's because of what he done for us. We
[1:37:36] do what we do. We come to church because
[1:37:38] my there's not enough hours in the day.
[1:37:42] There's not enough time. There's not
[1:37:44] enough tongue for me to speak about his
[1:37:46] goodness for towards us. We we want to
[1:37:49] show everybody around us that God is a
[1:37:52] good God. We want to show that the it's
[1:37:56] an appreciation of the work that he's
[1:37:58] done in our life. There's something we
[1:38:00] refuse to let the shame or the things
[1:38:03] that we have done. We want to show that
[1:38:05] God has make us free from the things
[1:38:08] that we used to be. He says Ephesians
[1:38:10] 1:3 says blessed be the God of our
[1:38:13] father Lord Jesus who had blessed us
[1:38:15] with all spiritual blessings. He says
[1:38:17] all the spiritual blessings all the
[1:38:20] treasures belong to you.
[1:38:23] He says in John 15 and5,
[1:38:27] I am the vine and ye are the branches.
[1:38:30] If he abide in me
[1:38:34] and I
[1:38:36] in you,
[1:38:39] the same bringeth forth fruit.
[1:38:42] For without me you can do nothing.
[1:38:46] In him we can do all things. outside of
[1:38:50] him, we can't do anything. If I can
[1:38:52] encourage you tonight,
[1:38:55] let's get into Christ.
[1:38:58] Let's run into the source of our
[1:38:59] security. Let's stay in there. You know,
[1:39:03] when says it speaks about the type of
[1:39:05] the temple, it says if you are in the
[1:39:07] outside, you are subject to the rain.
[1:39:10] And you know, when the rain comes, your
[1:39:12] Christianity is based on the weather.
[1:39:14] You know, if everything goes right, you
[1:39:16] are a good Christian. If somebody cuts
[1:39:18] you off, your Christianity stops right
[1:39:20] there. You will pick it up after you
[1:39:22] give him your two senses.
[1:39:27] And then inside you were subject to the
[1:39:30] candlesticks, right? So as long as there
[1:39:34] was oil, you were a Christian. And then
[1:39:37] the moment the oil runs out, it's
[1:39:39] darkness.
[1:39:41] That's not what we want to be. But he
[1:39:43] said, "But there's a place by me.
[1:39:46] There's a place in the rock. There's a
[1:39:48] place that's called the Holy of Holies
[1:39:50] where we are called to be into Christ.
[1:39:53] Whether it be bad weather, good weather,
[1:39:56] whether it be uh uh trials, no trials,
[1:39:59] whether it be uh anything that happens,
[1:40:01] nothing moves you. Why? Because you find
[1:40:04] yourself in there. You always have
[1:40:06] peace. You know that if he wants it for
[1:40:09] me, I will take it. where there's
[1:40:12] something in your heart that's at peace
[1:40:14] that as long as I'm in Christ,
[1:40:17] I am good. It doesn't matter whether I
[1:40:20] have, don't have. It doesn't matter
[1:40:23] whether I'm sick or well. All I want to
[1:40:25] do is glorify him when all is said and
[1:40:28] done. That's the place we need to be.
[1:40:30] Not, oh, today the stock market is down
[1:40:32] and you are in the bad mood that day and
[1:40:36] you know, tomorrow, oh, inflation is up.
[1:40:39] you know, you don't know how to pay your
[1:40:40] bills and you're scratching your head.
[1:40:42] He said he's the father. He'll provide
[1:40:44] for you.
[1:40:47] In fact, let me say this. He's made a
[1:40:50] provision already.
[1:40:53] There's nothing that's going to cut you
[1:40:55] that God doesn't know about, that he was
[1:40:57] not prepared about. He already provided
[1:41:00] everything. If the lamb was slain before
[1:41:03] the foundation of the world, so is
[1:41:05] everything that we have need of was
[1:41:07] already provided. Let's all stand.
[1:41:15] [Music]
[1:41:23] Amen. I I don't know. I just pray that
[1:41:28] Lord will lead us in that we may as
[1:41:32] believers of this message walk more and
[1:41:35] more into the revelation of our age that
[1:41:38] the things which were promised that we
[1:41:40] may walk by them and that we may see the
[1:41:42] manifestation of Christ in our life.
[1:41:45] That's just my burning heart desire that
[1:41:47] Lord get us ready for rapture by the
[1:41:50] word of God. Let us the it easily let
[1:41:53] away the the weights that so easily
[1:41:55] besets uses the sin and the things and
[1:41:58] that we may be so focused on Christ
[1:42:01] until nothing matters. Nothing else
[1:42:03] matters except him. Is that your heart
[1:42:06] desire tonight? Let's just lift your
[1:42:08] hand to him as we sing this song and
[1:42:09] just say, "Father, that's my heart
[1:42:11] desire tonight. Oh, in Christ song. Oh,
[1:42:16] and my hope is found. Oh, and is my
[1:42:21] light, my strength,

[1:46:27] run the last mile that's left and that
[1:46:30] your power your love may be manifested
[1:46:32] in us. Father if we lack anything you
[1:46:35] said ask and it shall be given. Yeah, we
[1:46:38] all gather in your presence. I say,

[1:46:46] Father, that you bless each one and

[1:47:06] very new birth. You making yourself
[1:47:08] known to each individual. Lead us and

[1:47:16] that you've given us and not by our
[1:47:18] flesh. We commit everything we are. And

[1:56:59] Precious heavenly father, Lord God, we
[1:57:01] truly thank you for this wonderful
[1:57:02] service this evening. Lord, just a
[1:57:04] remembrance to to where our hope lies in
[1:57:07] Father Lord God. It's in your name, Lord
[1:57:09] Jesus Christ. That's where our hiding
[1:57:11] places, our security is, Father Lord,
[1:57:13] when all around the world is is falling
[1:57:16] apart, Lord God. But Lord, we have a
[1:57:17] hope in you, Lord Jesus. And in your
[1:57:19] name, Lord God, that you called us,
[1:57:21] Lord, out of this this dying world,
[1:57:23] Father, and and told us that you loved
[1:57:24] us and Father, Lord, that you would
[1:57:26] bring us home, Lord. And we we hope and
[1:57:28] rest in that, Father, Lord God, knowing
[1:57:30] that it's not because of what we can do
[1:57:31] or what we've done, but because you said
[1:57:33] it to be, Lord God. And that's where our
[1:57:36] faith lies in, Lord Jesus Christ. And we
[1:57:38] just commit the rest of this week to
[1:57:39] you, Father Lord. I pray you'd replenish
[1:57:41] Brother Billy's strength, Lord, and
[1:57:42] Brother Matthews as well for the
[1:57:44] wonderful sermons that was given to us
[1:57:45] today, Lord, with our pastor on his way
[1:57:47] back home, Father Lord. And may each of
[1:57:50] us, Lord, carry one for another, Lord
[1:57:51] God, and love one another, Father Lord,
[1:57:53] and be there for each other cuz we're a
[1:57:55] body, Father, Lord God. We're not in
[1:57:56] this alone, but Lord God, we're in this
[1:57:58] together. Lord God, you brought us
[1:58:00] together for a reason, Father. You
[1:58:01] brought us here to hear the word tonight
[1:58:02] for a reason, God. And we just thank you
[1:58:04] for it. And I pray you'd be with us the
[1:58:06] rest of this week, Lord God. May these
[1:58:08] words not leave us, Lord God. And Lord,
[1:58:10] may we seek you every day, Lord God, and
[1:58:12] and put this flesh to rest, Lord, to to
[1:58:14] death, Father, Lord, and just rise up
[1:58:16] with you. I commit the rest of this day
[1:58:18] to you. The rest of this week, we just
[1:58:20] prayed in your name, the Lord Jesus
[1:58:21] Christ. Amen.

[2:00:56] never been sorry
[2:00:59] that I trust in his name.
