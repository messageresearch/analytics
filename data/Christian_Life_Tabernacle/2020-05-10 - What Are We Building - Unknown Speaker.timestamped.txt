[11:33] everyone as in fact buddy Mike for so
[11:35] I'm reading this morning just remember
[11:38] you know the rules that we're given for
[11:42] social distancing you know just a void
[11:46] don't go out after service just wait the
[11:49] brothers are going to walk you out and
[11:51] and the tithes and offerings are things
[11:56] put in the back for you to put it in and
[11:58] all of that so welcome here in the house
[12:00] of God amen god bless you brother Mike
[12:23] cos you'll bear with me a few uh thank
[12:26] you if you've already had a sneak peek
[12:29] well then you know sorry but you get a
[12:31] repeat version but it I was struck this
[12:36] week actually by the comment that my
[12:38] co-worker made about us actually being
[12:42] under house arrest he he was saying you
[12:47] know quarantine is when you lock down a
[12:50] sick person when you lock down healthy
[12:53] people it's tyranny were under house
[12:55] arrest and I thought well that's an
[12:57] interesting and not an accurate way to
[13:00] describe it but slowly but surely you
[13:03] know we're working ourselves out of this
[13:06] by God's grace and you know it's been
[13:09] said that if you you don't know what you
[13:12] have until it's gone the truth is that
[13:16] you know you had it you just never
[13:18] thought you'd lose it and as we kind of
[13:22] come out of this thing you know and I'm
[13:25] sorry but I've my eyes aren't very good
[13:27] so I'm gonna open up a bigger screen I'm
[13:29] sorry forgive me just a minute
[13:32] someday you'll be all two like I said
[13:42] this is a weird experience so you know
[13:47] we we were so used to taking things for
[13:50] granted we never gave it a thought to
[13:54] let's go out for let's go out for lunch
[13:56] after church you know the biggest
[13:58] decision was where where do we go what
[14:01] are you hungry for I don't care not that
[14:05] oh you've been there too and you know we
[14:11] we just want the Costco you get the car
[14:14] you drive someplace you do your thing
[14:16] and we don't think two things about it
[14:19] I'm gonna stop and get a haircut on the
[14:21] way home from work and the barbershops
[14:25] are closed or maybe you're not working
[14:26] and I'm very grateful to a Christian
[14:28] friend who cut my hair recently so I
[14:31] didn't look like one of the Muppets but
[14:35] the truth is we're all learning to adapt
[14:38] and in the process we're learning
[14:40] suddenly we don't have freedom now you
[14:44] know maybe it's for a good reason
[14:46] you know that's a debate for another day
[14:49] but when the news carries the story
[14:51] about a barber who decides she's going
[14:53] to open up a shop and they flirt in jail
[14:55] or the mayor of a New Mexico City that
[14:59] locks down the coming in and they're
[15:01] going out so nobody can leave and nobody
[15:03] can go in freedom is something we've
[15:08] suddenly begun to realize maybe we took
[15:11] it just a little too for granted and you
[15:14] know when we look at that from a
[15:16] spiritual standpoint we contemplate our
[15:19] current realities and our Christian walk
[15:22] several things have come to mind as I
[15:25] pondered this and like you I've had
[15:27] plenty of time to sit home and ponder
[15:30] first I'm so thankful that the Lord has
[15:33] lifted me out of a horrible pit out of
[15:35] the miry clay of my life and sent me
[15:37] upon the rock the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:40] that's an absolute it absolutely is a
[15:46] promise we can stand upon he established
[15:49] my goings and you know I'm certain
[15:53] beyond a doubt of that promise of that
[15:57] fact John says if the son therefore
[16:00] shall make you free you shall be free
[16:04] indeed second thing I've been humbled to
[16:09] remember that the blessings that we
[16:12] enjoy the twists and turns of our life
[16:15] can suddenly change everything
[16:18] you know it's easy to be on cruise and
[16:22] just accept our prosperity our
[16:24] employment our good health our mo vision
[16:27] our mobility our vision our food our
[16:31] bathroom necessities just take it for
[16:34] granted and then we have it removed by
[16:38] governments or a virus or natural
[16:42] disasters or demons and job is the
[16:47] scriptural evidence for that so that's
[16:50] the second thing we can learn out of
[16:52] this is just being always thankful and
[16:54] appreciative and not take for granted
[16:56] the little things of life the third
[16:58] thing I have been reminded daily about
[17:04] the goodness of our God in all
[17:07] situations I'm just thankful anew not
[17:09] for his blessings only but for his
[17:11] promises because he's promised that we
[17:16] won't see the righteous forsaken nor the
[17:19] seed begging bread his word says I'll
[17:21] not leave you nor forsake you I will
[17:25] never leave you never is an absolute
[17:27] word it's an absolute promise made by an
[17:31] absolute God no matter what comes our
[17:34] way
[17:34] no matter what we go through no matter
[17:37] what cootie surfaces next year or what
[17:40] the government decides to do he will
[17:42] never leave us nor forsake us God is in
[17:45] control of our lives and that's an
[17:47] absolute fact and you know I I quoted
[17:51] because I I find it so good what the
[17:54] Apostle Paul said in Romans 8 I am
[17:56] persuaded that neither death nor life
[17:59] and our angels nor principalities nor
[18:02] powers nor things present nor things to
[18:04] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[18:08] creature or Kuti shall be able to
[18:11] separate us from the love of God which
[18:13] is in Christ Jesus our Lord blessed be
[18:15] his wonderful name let's turn to Psalms
[18:19] 40 this morning
[18:23] sorry I'm too long that's what you get
[18:26] when I get up early and write Psalms 40
[18:31] as we read it together if you're home
[18:33] read it along with us I waited patiently
[18:35] for the Lord and he inclined unto me and
[18:39] heard my cried he brought me up also out
[18:42] of an horrible pit out of the miry clay
[18:45] and set my feet upon a rock and
[18:48] established my goings and he hath put a
[18:51] new song in my mouth even praise unto
[18:54] our God many shall see it and fear and
[18:57] shall trust in the Lord blessed is that
[19:01] man that maketh the Lord his trust and
[19:03] respect of not the proud nor such as
[19:07] turn aside to lies many Oh Lord my God
[19:10] are thy wonderful works which thou has
[19:13] done and thy thoughts which are to us
[19:16] word they cannot be reckoned up in order
[19:19] unto thee if I would declare and speak
[19:22] of them they are more than can be
[19:24] numbered sacrifice and offering thou
[19:27] didst not desire mine ears has now
[19:30] opened burnt offering and sin offering
[19:33] as thou not required they said I lo come
[19:37] in the volume of the book it is written
[19:40] of me I delight to do thy will o my god
[19:44] ei
[19:45] thy law is within my heart I have
[19:48] preached righteousness in the great
[19:49] congregation lo
[19:51] I have not refrained my lips o Lord thou
[19:54] knowest if not hid thy righteousness
[19:57] within my heart I have declared thy
[20:00] faithfulness and thy salvation
[20:02] I have not concealed by loving-kindness
[20:05] and thy truth from the great
[20:07] congregation withhold not now thy tender
[20:10] mercies from me O Lord let thy
[20:13] loving-kindness and thy truth
[20:15] continually preserve me for innumerable
[20:18] evils have compass me about mine
[20:21] iniquities have taken hold upon me so
[20:24] that I am not able to look up they are
[20:27] more than the hairs of mine head
[20:29] therefore my heart faileth me be pleased
[20:32] O Lord to deliver me O Lord make haste
[20:36] to hell
[20:36] me let them be ashamed and confounded
[20:39] together that seek after my soul to
[20:42] destroy it let them be driven backward
[20:45] and put to shame that wish me evil
[20:48] let them be desolate for a reward of
[20:51] their shame that say unto me ah-ha-ah-ha
[20:54] let all those that seek thee rejoice and
[20:58] be glad in thee let such as love die
[21:00] salvation say continually the Lord be
[21:04] magnified but I am poor and needy
[21:07] yet the Lord thinketh upon me thou art
[21:10] my help and my deliverer make no
[21:13] tarrying oh my god amen
[21:24] into the water being baptized oh I've

[42:23] the power of the Sun we see you in the
[42:28] rising of the Moon at the evening and
[42:32] the Sun rising in the day and we see the
[42:35] Stars and we see the storms and the wind
[42:39] and the rain we look at the vastness of
[42:42] the ocean and all the magnificent
[42:46] creatures therein and all the creation

[43:10] bless us today in Jesus precious and
[43:14] wonderful name we pray amen amen amen
[43:20] god bless you may be seated it's
[43:25] certainly thank you musicians it's
[43:27] certainly nice to be in the house of the
[43:30] Lord it's still a little different as
[43:34] everybody's navigating their way through
[43:37] but it's good to see every time we see a
[43:41] face or new face it just gets this
[43:43] excited and very good to see you this
[43:46] morning and each one so we're just happy
[43:50] to be in the house of the Lord we have
[43:53] certain things in our heart today that
[43:55] we would like to to share with you and
[43:59] hope that you can follow along and we
[44:05] can put this in a perspective that it
[44:10] could be understood but it's a real
[44:15] direction in my heart that I feel that
[44:18] the Lord wants me to go in and and you
[44:24] know if you've ever had the Lord deal
[44:26] your heart it's hard to get away from it
[44:28] you know first of all you the first
[44:31] reaction I don't think all of us have
[44:33] this is unbelief you know oh that's not
[44:36] God or it's not that and so you try to
[44:38] go away and you find yourself back there
[44:41] and then you try to go away and you find
[44:43] yourself back there and then you begin
[44:46] to question you know well this is too
[44:49] simple everybody knows this and and but
[44:53] it's just when it finally comes down to
[44:56] it you have no choice I think of the
[44:59] words that Paul's broke the spoke when
[45:02] he said I'm a prisoner you know he said
[45:05] I'm a prisoner not to these chains of
[45:08] this cell because I'm sure he heard that
[45:12] testimony a Peter that those doors came
[45:15] open and Peter walked out you know and
[45:18] and the many other great things that
[45:20] he'd seen God do but he was bound to the
[45:25] Word of God he was bowing to the
[45:27] leadership of the Holy Spirit and I
[45:30] really feel that's an important thing
[45:32] for all of us to be bound to is the
[45:35] Spirit of God and how that he's dealing
[45:38] with their heart a certain message came
[45:43] on my heart and it just it kind of just
[45:48] struck me and and you know I thought it
[45:53] in when I heard the tape in that tape
[45:58] was it said what house will you build me
[46:02] and when I heard that I knew that that
[46:07] was a tape you know what I mean so I
[46:10] went and I got the little tape and I
[46:13] listened to it and it was kind of a
[46:18] summing up of kind of some of the
[46:20] feelings that I was feeling and what I
[46:24] was going through and so I just felt
[46:26] that I'd like to play that this morning
[46:29] it's 27 minutes long and I think that
[46:34] you will notice in brother
[46:39] Ren's voice that there seems to be an
[46:44] urgency there seems to be something
[46:48] pressing on his heart you can tell
[46:54] there's a realization that he has come
[46:58] too and the message is he's preaching at
[47:04] saying a few words at the brother of
[47:08] Perry greens church in Tucson whether
[47:11] Brenham had moved there brother Perry
[47:13] decided to move there and so brother
[47:17] brems blessing praying for him and
[47:20] blessing his church but it's the context
[47:23] of the things that are being said that I
[47:28] think that we should take heed to I
[47:30] believe we should take key to everything
[47:33] that the messenger says but I think
[47:38] certain things are are wonderful least
[47:42] spoken and this tape was preached in
[47:46] 1121 just a month before brother Branham
[47:50] left the scene and and he talks about a
[47:56] church and the title again is what house
[48:02] will you build me and so I'd like to
[48:06] listen to this and then I'd like to pose
[48:08] that question back to us what house are
[48:14] we building and and so without delay
[48:24] we'll go ahead and start listening I I
[48:28] know sometimes it's a little hard to get
[48:31] the tape to play on the internet so it
[48:34] might take them a second to do that but
[48:37] this the scriptures that we are going to
[48:40] read are found in the book I believe
[48:44] it's the book of Acts so let me give you
[48:49] the scriptures exactly so we're going to
[48:52] read from the
[48:53] the book of Acts the seventh chapter
[48:56] beginning with the 44th verse so when it
[49:01] comes time for brother Branham to read
[49:03] those scriptures let us just stand for
[49:06] the reading of the word and then when
[49:09] he's finished reading the scriptures we
[49:13] can sit down so let's just say a prayer
[49:16] if you just pay attention to the small
[49:19] details and the content of what's being
[49:22] said just 27 minutes
[49:24] let us pray father we ask you to bless
[49:27] this time to us father we are people
[49:32] that have gathered here because we have
[49:37] one thing in common and that's the grace
[49:40] of your salvation and the blood that you
[49:44] shed on Calvary for us and father it's
[49:47] been quickened to our hearts by your
[49:50] spirit that you had sent a message in
[49:53] this day to the church that you raised
[49:57] up and vindicated a scriptural
[50:01] prophesied profit that was manifested
[50:05] according to the word that was spoken of
[50:08] him and the works that he performed
[50:12] father were truly works of vindication
[50:15] to prove that you are with him but
[50:19] father it was the message that he
[50:21] brought the things that he was wanting
[50:24] to reveal to this church what he was
[50:28] trying to prepare us for and Lord we
[50:31] want to listen to a portion of that this
[50:34] morning we believe it's truth we asked
[50:36] you to open our eyes to it this morning
[50:39] in Jesus precious name we pray amen god
[50:43] bless you I believe you'll enjoy it
[50:52] you
[56:35] seems strange maybe but he as far as I
[56:39] know anything I know of God I was sent
[56:43] by a vision to Tucson amen
[56:45] I wonder how I ever was sent to this
[56:48] desert place and then here where there
[56:53] is spiritually speaking over the city I
[56:58] don't know of any place that's any more
[57:02] spiritual dead in the City of Tucson
[57:05] there is war between the churches there
[57:09] is fusses between the congregations
[57:11] there's no unity and everyone grabbing
[57:14] and holding and squeezing and trying to
[57:17] get this one and cross body it is a
[57:19] desert spiritually speaking also but
[57:23] then I read in the Bible now where God
[57:28] Paul Moses away from his loved ones and
[57:31] all that was dear to him and sinning
[57:33] into the wilderness to write the laws of
[57:36] the Bible that was the Old Testament the
[57:38] first four books Genesis Leviticus
[57:41] Deuteronomy Exodus he understood their
[57:46] mission routine but for books that
[57:48] really is the Old Testament because the
[57:51] rest of it was what the prophets said in
[57:53] the Psalms of David and so forth but the
[57:56] Chronicles of the kings but this was the
[58:00] fundamental of the Old Testament was
[58:03] Moses wrote them after he was called
[58:06] from his homeland or he had been born
[58:09] and brought up amongst people and was
[58:11] sent into the desert to write this book
[58:15] of the Old Testament then I find that in
[58:19] the book of the New Testament or Paul
[58:22] which is the author or not the author
[58:24] but the writer of the New Testament he
[58:28] also was drove out from among his people
[58:31] and by the spirit into the Arabia where
[58:38] he was three-and-a-half years to find
[58:41] the inspiration and Paul is the chief
[58:45] writer
[58:46] New Testament now there is Matthew Mark
[58:49] Luke and John but they were scribes that
[58:51] this wrote what Jesus said if they
[58:53] followed him along and but you take the
[58:57] book to Timothy and to the Romans and to
[59:00] the Hebrews and so forth Paul received
[59:04] inspiration to write the New Testament
[59:07] taking all the Old Testament as the
[59:09] shadow and setting in an order and God
[59:12] honored it and made it the New Testament
[59:15] now if the Old Testament had to be a
[59:20] drove from the rider had to be drove
[59:24] from his people into the wilderness to
[59:28] get inspiration to write the Old
[59:31] Testament and in the New Testament the
[59:34] rider was drove by the author into a
[59:38] desert place to get the inspiration to
[59:40] write the New Testament and the books
[59:43] are sealed with seven seals it would
[59:45] also require the same I believe in these
[59:48] days to open those seven commands
[59:51] believe what you hold dear now watch you
[59:54] cherish a little home that was given me
[59:58] by the people and amongst all my people
[1:00:00] and friends in a church that was
[1:00:02] flourishing and had nothing lacking and
[1:00:07] to lead that pull right away from it and
[1:00:10] move away out into a desert where you
[1:00:13] knew no body and everything against you
[1:00:15] but there's something about God that he
[1:00:20] drives a man to do things it's beyond
[1:00:22] any thinking of his own so it can be
[1:00:24] through the glory and honor of God and I
[1:00:29] feel that not self honor but I feel the
[1:00:34] privilege it was to leave everything
[1:00:36] that was called dear to me to get here
[1:00:39] into this wilderness and suffer like I
[1:00:41] have never suffered in my life here in
[1:00:44] this wilderness for this desert but I
[1:00:46] believe it in doing that and obeying
[1:00:48] what God commanded to be done God is
[1:00:52] open to us the mysteries of
[1:00:54] sliced days and we are here with this
[1:01:00] message now there was many people who
[1:01:04] follow me and that's not unusual usually
[1:01:08] a person we people love one another and
[1:01:11] love of Drive you to do things you don't
[1:01:14] think you would do many of you let your
[1:01:18] home's you left all just to come out
[1:01:20] here in the desert many has called me
[1:01:23] many as asked me shall we come to
[1:01:25] Arizona it would it be a good place for
[1:01:28] us well as it was said about Moses and
[1:01:31] them it was no place of fruit no place
[1:01:35] of pomegranate and here there's not much
[1:01:37] work to do and living and tie the cost
[1:01:40] of living is high it's a really a rough
[1:01:43] place to live is Tucson Arizona wages
[1:01:47] are poor and and food is high and rent
[1:01:51] it's it's a horrible place to live and
[1:01:53] whatever but it's healthy it's dry and
[1:01:58] we sometimes we must get our minds
[1:02:02] fashioned on things of this earth we
[1:02:05] must look to the leading of the Holy
[1:02:06] Spirit but one thing that trouble me and
[1:02:10] coming here to telling people well you
[1:02:13] should not come or you should come then
[1:02:16] I'll leave up to each individual the way
[1:02:19] God leads that individual to do I think
[1:02:23] every one of us should do that be led by
[1:02:25] the spirit and what to do and many of
[1:02:29] you here from around Jefferson Building
[1:02:31] of the congregation there and you have
[1:02:34] come out here now the thing that
[1:02:38] bothered me was a place of worship now
[1:02:43] realizes are read in the scripture here
[1:02:45] of Stevens and is the dress just before
[1:02:48] his death or they stoned him immediately
[1:02:51] Edwards for his message as he was
[1:02:55] speaking he said our fathers talking of
[1:02:59] the Hebrews in the early days how that
[1:03:02] they tried to find favor before God to
[1:03:05] build a place for or
[1:03:08] he said that Solomon building a house or
[1:03:13] a building
[1:03:13] we're acquainted with the story but I
[1:03:17] like his next words how did the Most
[1:03:21] High dwelleth not in houses that's made
[1:03:23] with hands and another place over in
[1:03:27] Isaiah he said a body has prepared me
[1:03:34] sacrifice and offerings and buildings
[1:03:37] and so forth but a body has now prepared
[1:03:39] me well we realized that he was speaking
[1:03:42] then of the body or gob tabernacle in
[1:03:46] Christ well I believe today that the
[1:03:49] inspiration that's come - to brother
[1:03:53] greenies to move here him and sister
[1:03:56] green giving up their place back in the
[1:04:00] east also - back in Texas to come here
[1:04:05] with the start with nothing just simply
[1:04:09] by an inspiration feeling that they
[1:04:12] should do I appreciate man that will
[1:04:17] follow the leading of Christ regardless
[1:04:20] of the cost it's awesome
[1:04:24] though the whole world may be your very
[1:04:27] best friends think that you're wrong but
[1:04:31] it isn't wrong to you as long as you
[1:04:35] feel there's something behind it as blob
[1:04:38] moving it's never wrong they'll always
[1:04:42] pan out right this young couple of
[1:04:47] talented young man and standest because
[1:04:49] he's sitting here this young lady with
[1:04:52] her baby's family - raised pretty job
[1:04:56] and everything to move here I realized
[1:05:00] it years ago I was called ministry I've
[1:05:04] never made a successful pastor because
[1:05:07] Rome and rambling spirit I can't be
[1:05:12] satisfied anywhere
[1:05:13] just wherever the spirit moves I just
[1:05:16] got to move with it because
[1:05:18] I had a message Jesus said I miss
[1:05:22] preaching this other counter also but
[1:05:24] the are those who are Shepherds that
[1:05:28] watch the flock so grateful that brother
[1:05:33] Perry all of the leading of the Holy
[1:05:35] Spirit and today we have a tabernacle
[1:05:41] it's a smile and that's just good enough
[1:05:43] to start with
[1:05:44] let's see what the Holy Spirit not
[1:05:46] knowing that's just move step by step
[1:05:49] now I believe if God has spoke to
[1:05:54] brother and sister greenie to come here
[1:05:58] and it's opened up a place where our
[1:06:00] children instead of a Sunday morning
[1:06:02] ride their bicycles and all the streets
[1:06:05] in River area they have a place to come
[1:06:07] to worship instead of us sitting around
[1:06:09] listen to something that we were on
[1:06:11] radio which is alright but we as this
[1:06:16] group of people we had a message for
[1:06:19] this day we we believe that God is
[1:06:21] giving us of message and brother green
[1:06:24] is I don't know cutting - no shape
[1:06:29] because we are a relative also my
[1:06:32] associate we are together in this
[1:06:35] message brother green preaches the same
[1:06:37] thing a message that I believe it he's
[1:06:40] restless wrong is that his people is
[1:06:42] that these churches as a levy the
[1:06:45] district super generators something of
[1:06:46] one of the organizations and give the
[1:06:48] whole bring up when he heard this let
[1:06:51] everything that was during him also he
[1:06:53] come to the desert justice occur what
[1:06:56] what is giving to us
[1:06:58] I say believe it's that not only should
[1:07:03] be in our house
[1:07:04] this should be our duty to back him up
[1:07:08] everything that we came between the
[1:07:11] services to come here to worship and to
[1:07:13] make this a place where God can reveal
[1:07:18] to us the things that he has forced to
[1:07:21] reveal and it's his words that the
[1:07:23] message doesn't come to me through the
[1:07:26] reading of the inspiration as it does
[1:07:29] the
[1:07:30] maybe to some of us but he said I'm here
[1:07:34] to back up what God has given what else
[1:07:38] things and I believe if we will all
[1:07:42] cooperate together we will put our
[1:07:46] hearts to it oh no really each one of
[1:07:49] you if you feel like I do I am so hungry
[1:07:56] the see the Spirit of God moving
[1:07:59] I just can't harvest and some
[1:08:04] experiences have extended up in the
[1:08:07] mountain just to feel that once again
[1:08:12] that's something that when I was first
[1:08:15] Saved the seborrhea to my heart and we
[1:08:18] can come into a place we can set and
[1:08:21] we've seen an illness that we're driving
[1:08:24] as we study with desert dirty mind my
[1:08:28] brother they talked with me I talked
[1:08:30] with them all these in a little way I'm
[1:08:33] watching dealing out there in the spirit
[1:08:35] as it was to see just the condition that
[1:08:38] brother and see that's wrong I begin to
[1:08:41] feel this all reclining getting away
[1:08:43] from the spirit it's become too natural
[1:08:46] a thing to us we must worship in the
[1:08:49] spirit or the Spirit of God not only our
[1:08:53] message should be the flame of the hour
[1:08:56] this should be the flame in our hearts
[1:08:59] it's got to be in our hearts or we can't
[1:09:01] we can't rightly present it to the
[1:09:04] people the spirit has to pack the
[1:09:07] message itself
[1:09:09] now I'm trusting and believing and ever
[1:09:12] wanted me to be a real Christian now
[1:09:14] they need Sunday School teachers they're
[1:09:17] going to need a stand and I want to say
[1:09:22] this so that you thoroughly understand
[1:09:25] this is my church
[1:09:30] I've been here three years and I've had
[1:09:34] one door open to me that was brother
[1:09:37] Nicky a sneak um preach god bless me I
[1:09:40] haven't been invited by any other people
[1:09:42] not nothing against them they're all
[1:09:45] right brother Broc a good friend of mine
[1:09:48] brother Gilmore may these Pentecostal
[1:09:50] brethren here are very very deep good
[1:09:53] friends of mine I love them nothing
[1:09:55] against them I understand their position
[1:09:57] they can't invite me in there and then
[1:10:00] remain in their organization see they
[1:10:03] can't do it because if they do they're
[1:10:05] kicked out so you see their position I
[1:10:09] had the same thing to face the mob would
[1:10:13] always be seeking first the kingdom of
[1:10:16] God and now that brother green God has
[1:10:21] sent him in here an openness of the
[1:10:23] Church of like precious faith that we
[1:10:26] believe we ought to be very grateful to
[1:10:28] God you can never service take every
[1:10:32] place that we can and if we're asked to
[1:10:35] calm to pray to seek to do let's be
[1:10:39] soldiers like them
[1:10:41] it's anxious to do it keep the message
[1:10:44] honorable liver I kind of like my little
[1:10:47] come up on it we're living too late
[1:10:50] now
[1:10:51] we're too late in the hour let's live it
[1:10:54] clean all my life your life all of our
[1:10:57] eyes needs to be picked up before God
[1:11:00] our young people just ride around and
[1:11:04] place the place to show to show and
[1:11:06] drifting further and further away from
[1:11:08] God like now that's the truth
[1:11:12] I sent my children now see myself
[1:11:17] getting to a place where not you you got
[1:11:20] to cymbal ourselves together to worship
[1:11:23] the Bible said so when we see this day
[1:11:25] approaching that looks more come
[1:11:27] together if there's only two people here
[1:11:29] you be one of them now that's if we come
[1:11:32] together and worship together then we
[1:11:34] just something another about it Jesus
[1:11:36] there were two or three are gathered in
[1:11:38] my name there I am in their mid as I've
[1:11:40] said before brother green told me and he
[1:11:44] said if my wife come told me what he
[1:11:45] said when I was away that he said this
[1:11:50] morning the pulpit was open at any time
[1:11:53] not usually that's open for me to speak
[1:11:56] I usually I had to drive all the way to
[1:12:00] Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message
[1:12:02] of God game to bring it to the people go
[1:12:05] all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:12:06] and each one of you streaming across the
[1:12:08] country and hooking up the wires and
[1:12:10] thing to get the message because that's
[1:12:11] what we're living on that's what we're
[1:12:14] here for
[1:12:15] well we don't have to do that anymore
[1:12:19] God gives me a message I can walk right
[1:12:21] here to a pulpit and preach it feel free
[1:12:23] today and I believe by that that God
[1:12:28] Almighty will bless you if you will just
[1:12:30] stand by this church this group of
[1:12:33] people not only then but let's go out
[1:12:38] and see if we can't get others to come
[1:12:43] in see let's speak to others everywhere
[1:12:45] speak to about our church what it means
[1:12:48] for our church we're here if we want you
[1:12:51] to come bring in strangers and I'm sure
[1:12:53] it'll be good for all of us see we have
[1:12:56] a building which we're thankful for
[1:12:58] we're thankful for this place together
[1:13:00] together but high beer the most hype
[1:13:03] dwelleth not in people's made with hang
[1:13:08] for heaven is my throne and earth is my
[1:13:11] footstool and where is the place of my
[1:13:13] wrist but a body has out prepared me and
[1:13:16] we are a body of Christ so as we move
[1:13:21] from one building to another building
[1:13:23] I believe in bringing our messages and
[1:13:26] we'll come down and have healing
[1:13:27] services and anything the Lord reveals
[1:13:29] to us to do had it right during the
[1:13:31] church until it swells out to
[1:13:33] I've taken somewhere else in somewhere
[1:13:35] else until Jesus comes god bless you
[1:13:43] dear God as we stand here on this
[1:13:47] platform which represents God over the
[1:13:51] altar here we realize that we are a
[1:13:58] dying race of people as far as this
[1:14:01] earth is concerned we look out upon the
[1:14:04] streets in C sin wrote everywhere and if
[1:14:09] the glory of the Lord is swiftly
[1:14:11] departed we know when the glory of the
[1:14:14] Lord goes up so will the church go with
[1:14:16] it godly want to be there just a few
[1:14:22] days ago is standing here on the
[1:14:23] streetcar just across the street
[1:14:26] watching that parade go down the street
[1:14:33] and seeing those old first war tanks
[1:14:38] leading the way then come the big heavy
[1:14:41] Sherman tank behind that followed on and
[1:14:45] on and on then the gold star up mother's
[1:14:49] the little broke up family with a crying
[1:14:52] wine from the little ragged boy lost his
[1:14:54] daddy no mother had lost a son oh how
[1:15:00] sad the stand on a street corner and
[1:15:05] watch something like that passed then
[1:15:08] notice in just as they passed this
[1:15:10] building the music's changed to already
[1:15:14] Christian soldiers playing their marches
[1:15:19] behind but when they passed this spot
[1:15:24] dear God I'm thinking of another great
[1:15:27] time coming and that would be the
[1:15:29] resurrection when the old timers will
[1:15:33] come forward the first saints of
[1:15:35] patriarchs or we which are alive and
[1:15:39] remain shall not prevent or hinder those
[1:15:41] which are asleep
[1:15:43] for the trumpet of God shall sound in
[1:15:45] the daddy Christ shall rise first name
[1:15:48] will be stood a Greek sister people
[1:15:51] going marching up to the skies and we be
[1:15:53] standing waiting for our change knowing
[1:15:57] it will fall in line also God make us
[1:16:02] faithful soldiers only those who really
[1:16:07] associated and been in the war but know
[1:16:11] what that really meant to see those
[1:16:12] tanks rolling by God we think that those
[1:16:16] who've been in the battle of life will
[1:16:19] know what it means when we're waiting
[1:16:22] our turn to fall in position and place
[1:16:24] in the resurrection to go up this my
[1:16:28] young brother standing here well trained
[1:16:32] ready dressed waiting for an old man to
[1:16:38] lay hands upon him one who's an old F&P
[1:16:41] from up there in the front line knowing
[1:16:45] that he must join the battle - dear God
[1:16:53] but these unworthy hands I'll lay upon
[1:16:56] my brother and representation of yours
[1:17:01] blessed brother green dear God who I
[1:17:04] blessed in Jesus name
[1:17:07] may he carry this message Lord into this
[1:17:12] city and wherever you occult may be
[1:17:15] loyal Hill with the spirit living a life
[1:17:19] above reproach God that he may have the
[1:17:25] hearts of the people that he might teach
[1:17:28] them and lead them and direct them in
[1:17:31] the path that we all desire to walk
[1:17:35] granite guard left his faithful life
[1:17:38] with little children bless our efforts
[1:17:41] here together as Christian Brothers here
[1:17:44] on earth that we may carry this gospel
[1:17:46] to the
[1:17:49] send your spirit upon in God we pray in
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ's name as we've given to
[1:17:56] you amen unless you'd better carry
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:10] you
[1:18:13] we know that brother Perry has gone on
[1:18:17] to be with the Lord and to me this
[1:18:21] morning it wasn't so much a history
[1:18:27] lesson or to look back at a church
[1:18:31] dedication but it was what I felt the
[1:18:38] burden that was on brother branham's
[1:18:40] heart as he began to say I see the
[1:18:42] church is drying I don't see the
[1:18:46] fellowship I don't see the love of the
[1:18:49] Spirit though wait it used to be I don't
[1:18:52] see the worship and and during this
[1:19:02] whole time I begin to realize and you
[1:19:07] know I'm not a very technical person but
[1:19:11] I begin to see and I begin to realize
[1:19:13] and I begin to understand that brain
[1:19:17] events like this seem to have a
[1:19:20] spiritual effect and the effect it has
[1:19:23] on a lot of times is attitude and and
[1:19:29] and the forgetting of what the prophet
[1:19:36] of God talked about in here the things
[1:19:38] that were dedicated to you know what
[1:19:41] house will you build me what was the
[1:19:46] question and I asked the question back
[1:19:50] to myself what are we building you know
[1:19:54] we're not interested in building a
[1:19:56] building
[1:19:56] you take a time like today this morning
[1:19:59] with and I guess we use YouTube to
[1:20:04] broadcast to those that can't be with us
[1:20:08] this morning and in so that's a media I
[1:20:12] don't much in media I don't really care
[1:20:15] for the fact that we're there but it's a
[1:20:18] way that it's given to communicate but I
[1:20:21] begin to realize when I went to it even
[1:20:24] to watch our service not
[1:20:26] my necessarily but the brothers to see
[1:20:28] how the process was going I begin to see
[1:20:31] how many different things there are
[1:20:34] along decide in choices to be made and I
[1:20:37] I began to realize that you know it's
[1:20:40] like this morning there's some that may
[1:20:44] be a part of our congregation are
[1:20:46] watching others will want something else
[1:20:49] somewhere and then come back and pick it
[1:20:52] up later you know and and stream it
[1:20:55] later or they'll watch their church and
[1:20:58] then they'll go watch another church or
[1:21:00] they'll watch this and they'll watch
[1:21:02] that and what a great time it's become
[1:21:07] for people not to be a part of anything
[1:21:12] you know it's a time of people's rights
[1:21:15] it's a time of people can just go about
[1:21:20] doing their their own thing and I felt
[1:21:26] the burden on brother Bam's heart it
[1:21:27] just like broke my heart when he said
[1:21:29] I've been here three years and nobody's
[1:21:31] even asked me to preach
[1:21:32] I mean someone that could discern the
[1:21:38] thoughts and intents of the heart can
[1:21:40] lay their hands on you and pray for you
[1:21:42] to discern I thought you know a good
[1:21:45] Shepherd would have wanted him to be
[1:21:49] there just to pray for his people you
[1:21:52] know and then he just he said I
[1:21:54] understand I don't hold it against him
[1:21:56] you know they lose their job
[1:21:59] yet in the same breath he said I
[1:22:01] appreciate a man that's willing to give
[1:22:03] up everything to follow the Word of God
[1:22:06] and that that's that's something to us
[1:22:09] you know are we willing to give up
[1:22:12] everything to follow the Word of God you
[1:22:17] know I I felt the pain and he said I
[1:22:20] lift all my friends I left everything
[1:22:22] that I had back there I left the people
[1:22:24] that loved me a place I had and I came
[1:22:26] out to this dry and I'd say he didn't
[1:22:30] give too son too good of a
[1:22:32] recommendation except for it was dry and
[1:22:35] not only did he say dry and healthy but
[1:22:38] he said
[1:22:39] dry spiritually now we just listened to
[1:22:42] that but you understand those things to
[1:22:44] me are warnings to me they cry out to my
[1:22:47] heart
[1:22:47] are we getting dry are we missing the
[1:22:51] point
[1:22:52] are we being caught up in a time where
[1:22:56] there's no more sacrifice there's no
[1:22:58] more giving there's no more leadership
[1:23:00] of the Holy Spirit there's no more
[1:23:02] there's no more hungry since I'm so
[1:23:05] hungry for the move of God he said that
[1:23:09] I can hardly stand it and you know the
[1:23:13] move of God God moving in the people God
[1:23:16] moving in amidst God really working on
[1:23:20] the behalf of one another
[1:23:23] people having burdens and set them
[1:23:26] before the Lord and staying there
[1:23:28] praying day and night till they see the
[1:23:31] hand of God move have we have we moved
[1:23:35] over to a realization and a failure to
[1:23:43] see what are we building and that's kind
[1:23:49] of the question that struck me is what
[1:24:00] are we building what is it what am i
[1:24:03] building is a pastor you know what are
[1:24:07] we building as a body what do you know
[1:24:11] do you can't build without a blueprint
[1:24:13] oh you can I've seen some real
[1:24:16] structures without a blueprint you know
[1:24:21] and without a plumb or without a level
[1:24:26] and they do for a while they do for a
[1:24:30] season but pretty soon it's not built to
[1:24:35] endure it's not built to last and we
[1:24:40] want to build something that lasts
[1:24:42] because you know the prophet of God said
[1:24:45] whatever we are here is what will be
[1:24:48] there many people said all if I lived in
[1:24:52] the day
[1:24:52] of the Lord I would believe it nope you
[1:24:55] would you would take the same approach
[1:24:57] then as you would it take now whether
[1:25:01] you have an absolute you know the
[1:25:03] hardest part any real believer in this
[1:25:07] message every real challenge to every
[1:25:10] called elector s'en in this day was the
[1:25:14] acceptance of that message as being an
[1:25:16] absolute everybody wants to claim their
[1:25:21] Bible and say well this is my absolute
[1:25:24] that Jesus is my absolute I only follow
[1:25:28] the Word of God you're following
[1:25:30] yourself and it's hard to die to
[1:25:36] yourself it's hard to lay down your
[1:25:39] ideas it's hard to it's hard to when you
[1:25:44] when your culture and your nature is
[1:25:47] something that's been taught to you
[1:25:50] remember culture is not something that
[1:25:53] you inherit the views I have on working
[1:25:57] the views I have on labor the views I
[1:26:00] have on construction those things were
[1:26:04] taught to me by my father because he was
[1:26:07] in construction they influenced me they
[1:26:11] became my viewpoints they became the
[1:26:14] ways that I looked in the ways that I
[1:26:17] felt and in the flesh I follow in those
[1:26:20] ways because I have no other I don't
[1:26:23] know anything else I don't know anything
[1:26:26] else but to work I don't know why I
[1:26:32] can't sit in a desk and go through pages
[1:26:37] hours after hours and read and study in
[1:26:41] sin in front of a computer the only
[1:26:46] thing I remember about my computer is my
[1:26:48] dad
[1:26:49] sitting there yelling at it this is 20
[1:26:54] years ago when they first come out you
[1:26:57] know he would say things like I know
[1:26:58] you're in there somewhere
[1:27:02] and it would be lost and it would go
[1:27:06] away and then those things have an
[1:27:09] effect and you approach things that way
[1:27:15] and then we ask ourselves what's
[1:27:20] influencing what we're building and I
[1:27:26] know that those things those nature's
[1:27:28] and those things that that we have that
[1:27:33] those are the things we have to deal
[1:27:35] with we've got a deal with our flesh
[1:27:39] we've got a deal with our upbringing we
[1:27:44] have to deal with our education we have
[1:27:47] to deal with the atmospheres we have to
[1:27:49] deal with the complexes that we received
[1:27:54] the the influence and the effect that
[1:27:58] circumstances had on us those are all
[1:28:01] things that we've got to deal with and I
[1:28:04] thought as a as we read in in that
[1:28:08] statement that the our great messenger
[1:28:11] may be said in Jesus in his personal
[1:28:14] life had to contend with himself in
[1:28:18] other words he learned obedience by the
[1:28:23] things he suffered I would like to have
[1:28:26] a greater understanding of that the
[1:28:29] riches of what if it suffered the image
[1:28:32] I had of Jesus he just waved his hand
[1:28:35] you know he didn't like something it
[1:28:37] went away no he did nothing until the
[1:28:42] father revealed it to him when the
[1:28:45] pressures came on to him for an answer
[1:28:48] he spoke not even when he was being a
[1:28:54] scourge dand persecuted and crucified he
[1:28:58] held this tongue and you know we we
[1:29:05] don't even understand that in comprehend
[1:29:07] the physical pain that he was went
[1:29:11] through you know
[1:29:14] never cursed them he said the pilot he
[1:29:19] said if my kingdom be of this world he
[1:29:21] said wouldn't my army come to fight for
[1:29:25] me o pilots good that army didn't show
[1:29:28] up because all the armies of Rome
[1:29:31] wouldn't have stopped that army when
[1:29:34] those chariots came out of heaven those
[1:29:36] flaming fiery horses and those angels
[1:29:39] with swords of flame and power and might
[1:29:42] and piercing eyes they could have
[1:29:44] nothing good has stood in his way but
[1:29:46] yet he held his peace for us he laid
[1:29:53] down his life for us
[1:29:56] that we might have life more abundantly
[1:30:00] and it's not this life he wants us to
[1:30:04] have an abundance it wasn't this life he
[1:30:08] wanted to have the buzzer it was eternal
[1:30:10] life that he wanted us to have an
[1:30:12] abundance another words he knew there
[1:30:14] was a life to come he knew there was a
[1:30:17] kingdom to come he knew there was a
[1:30:19] place that is electric return to and
[1:30:21] that's what he was interested in and
[1:30:24] that's why the question is is what are
[1:30:28] we building because we're not building a
[1:30:33] house of brick and mortar no what we're
[1:30:39] building he don't dwell in those we're
[1:30:42] not we're not building a something that
[1:30:48] can be touched and seen by hands where
[1:30:53] we're building something else we're
[1:30:56] building a body a spiritual body that
[1:31:02] that's what we're building and and and
[1:31:06] you know so God's plan was to send the
[1:31:11] Word of God he sent his son he didn't
[1:31:14] send a son to prepare us for life here
[1:31:17] he's sending his son to prepare us for
[1:31:21] life there he's not preparing us to live
[1:31:27] here
[1:31:28] he's not building us to live here if
[1:31:33] you're a Christian a real God ordained
[1:31:38] spirit-filled Christian that lives by
[1:31:42] the Word of God without compromise you
[1:31:45] do not fit in this world and you'll
[1:31:49] never be successful in this world you'll
[1:31:52] never reach the attainment that this
[1:31:54] world's reach you will never reach the
[1:31:56] potential that even they see in your
[1:31:59] flesh there's always a hand of restraint
[1:32:05] on you hold him back always put in the
[1:32:13] battle in your mind oh what'd I do
[1:32:16] better if I stayed here should I take
[1:32:18] that job there you know I might lose my
[1:32:21] job here okay and you you you've got to
[1:32:25] have something that anchors you and
[1:32:27] holds you so that's what we're talking
[1:32:31] about we're talking about this morning
[1:32:35] what are you building and you're all
[1:32:40] building something you know the that the
[1:32:45] definition of building first of all
[1:32:52] building means to construct or work you
[1:32:58] can't build without work I don't care if
[1:33:02] you're building a business I don't care
[1:33:04] if you're building something that's not
[1:33:06] made of hands but no matter what it
[1:33:11] takes building or construction the very
[1:33:14] term in itself means to work you got to
[1:33:20] work at it as you notice he said oh it
[1:33:26] just seems like everybody's just
[1:33:28] drifting along they're just they're just
[1:33:31] uh just seem to be tossed to and fro
[1:33:36] going here going there they don't got a
[1:33:39] vision
[1:33:42] and and that's when you build something
[1:33:45] you can't even build till you have a
[1:33:48] vision that was the beauty of the
[1:33:53] masterpiece what is that that
[1:33:55] Michelangelo had a vision he had
[1:33:59] something that he was building something
[1:34:02] that he was working on something that he
[1:34:05] was trying to achieve he has something
[1:34:07] that was set before him he wasn't tossed
[1:34:11] to and fro by every wind of doctrine
[1:34:13] blowing to and fro by every move of the
[1:34:16] Spirit he was steadfast in his heart
[1:34:19] with a purpose and a goal that he had in
[1:34:21] the mind and a vision that he was trying
[1:34:23] to obtain and he labored and it came to
[1:34:28] pass when we hear the message that God's
[1:34:31] got a masterpiece he has a family that
[1:34:35] he was trying to build a family that he
[1:34:37] was trying to restore a people that he
[1:34:40] was working on building and building
[1:34:47] means to construct by putting parts
[1:34:51] together we were going to put a fence
[1:35:01] gate together the other day him the
[1:35:05] brothers whom he we put it there so we
[1:35:08] asked the question are we going to read
[1:35:10] the instructions or are we going to do
[1:35:12] it like a man does it and then the
[1:35:17] brother says well we'll just look at the
[1:35:19] finished picture and go at it from there
[1:35:25] and when you end up with parts left over
[1:35:29] things that don't fit you find out
[1:35:32] there's a order that you have to do
[1:35:34] things in I bought a bed at IKEA for my
[1:35:41] mom's house and it was in the store it
[1:35:45] looked really nice but when they give me
[1:35:48] the bed it was in a box this big ain't
[1:35:53] never gonna put together an IKEA bed
[1:35:55] again
[1:35:58] because if you do one thing out of order
[1:36:02] if you put the wrong part or the wrong
[1:36:05] peg in the peg it's not clinical you got
[1:36:08] to do that thing exactly the way they
[1:36:12] say to do it and I'll guarantee you the
[1:36:14] devil designed those blueprints what are
[1:36:24] we building what house are you building
[1:36:28] me how was race he don't dwell in an
[1:36:34] Tabernacle himself in buildings like
[1:36:37] this he Tabernacles himself in people
[1:36:44] let's just read a few scriptures this
[1:36:46] morning that that we can build on so I
[1:36:51] can maybe come to and I think you'll see
[1:36:56] it so beautifully in the point that I
[1:37:01] feel led that if I say this the
[1:37:05] direction we ought to go as a local body
[1:37:08] a spiritual body believers that are
[1:37:11] fitted and joined together what should
[1:37:14] be the thing that's on our heart
[1:37:17] what are we laboring for what are we
[1:37:21] constructing what are we putting
[1:37:24] together what parts are we putting
[1:37:27] together because the build means to to
[1:37:31] to construct by by putting parts
[1:37:37] together what parts are we putting in
[1:37:41] our lives and let's read this scripture
[1:37:44] found I believe it's in 1st Corinthians
[1:37:47] I am and it's in the 3rd chapter
[1:38:05] and I'll just start with the fifth verse
[1:38:08] I think it'll begin to draw the picture
[1:38:11] that these principles were the
[1:38:15] principles of of the Word of God these
[1:38:20] were the principles we just talked about
[1:38:22] Paul by inspiration bringing the message
[1:38:26] through the church these are the
[1:38:27] messages that he brought he says who
[1:38:31] then is Paul who is Apollo's but
[1:38:35] ministers by whom he believed even as
[1:38:38] the Lord gave to every man I have
[1:38:41] planted Apollo's watered but God gave
[1:38:46] the increase so then neither is he that
[1:38:50] planteth anything neither he that
[1:38:54] watereth but god that giveth the
[1:38:58] increase oh that is still so beautiful
[1:39:03] today if we can look past the the the
[1:39:09] planner and we could look past the water
[1:39:12] which you can't do without who are they
[1:39:16] but ministers who minister to you but if
[1:39:19] you can see God giving you the increase
[1:39:22] that's the fellowship the fellowships
[1:39:25] when you hear something that's spoken or
[1:39:28] you listen to a tape or you read a
[1:39:30] scripture and you read the scripture and
[1:39:32] you see the scripture but then that
[1:39:34] presence of the Lord shows up and he
[1:39:38] opens your eyes to it whether it's in
[1:39:40] correction whether it's in instruction
[1:39:43] whether it's in reproof and you have
[1:39:46] that fellowship with God because it's
[1:39:48] his presence and he moves on you and
[1:39:50] it's like he said anytime you come into
[1:39:53] the presence of God you feel very little
[1:40:01] they said it just come to natural to us
[1:40:05] it's bad when religion and church
[1:40:10] becomes
[1:40:11] an ordinary routine and there's no
[1:40:15] increase in it you read your Bible
[1:40:19] month after month after month and
[1:40:21] there's no increase in it you listen to
[1:40:24] tapes after one after another maybe you
[1:40:27] stick it in your ear and you start in
[1:40:28] the morning and you quit and then
[1:40:30] there's no increase in it there's
[1:40:33] nothing being built there's nothing
[1:40:37] being put together there's nothing being
[1:40:39] constructed you end up the same person a
[1:40:42] year from now that you were then then it
[1:40:49] brings us to the question what are we
[1:40:52] building what are we putting together
[1:40:55] can you imagine a man being on the job
[1:40:58] and you hire a contractor and and he's
[1:41:02] there and you walk out there and you got
[1:41:05] a slab you know how that is don't you
[1:41:08] brother and you come back and you still
[1:41:10] got a slab where's the increase
[1:41:15] who's putting this thing together why
[1:41:19] isn't this showed up and that showed up
[1:41:24] and that's fine for that but what about
[1:41:31] us so he says there's got to be an
[1:41:37] increase now he that planteth and he
[1:41:40] that watereth are one but every man
[1:41:44] shall receive of his own reward
[1:41:46] according to his own labor according to
[1:41:57] what he's constructing your reward is
[1:42:00] going to be based not on the planner not
[1:42:05] on the water but what you've constructed
[1:42:10] with your own labor you're not going to
[1:42:15] get in I'm brother branham's message
[1:42:18] because he was the messenger you're not
[1:42:21] gonna get in on all these great
[1:42:23] preachers
[1:42:24] around the line in the end and the
[1:42:27] things that they've said in the great
[1:42:30] wisdoms they bring out in the great
[1:42:33] revelations that are brought forth and
[1:42:35] the things that you've never seen before
[1:42:37] and the all that they put you in great
[1:42:40] orders but you will be rewarded
[1:42:49] according to what you have built
[1:42:53] according to your Labor's or in other
[1:42:56] words what part did you put into your
[1:43:00] building we always want to go as a group
[1:43:09] but we have to go forth as individuals
[1:43:12] for we are laborers together with God ye
[1:43:22] are God's husbandry ye are God's
[1:43:26] building
[1:43:35] what is statement God's husband tree in
[1:43:41] other words your what God's working on
[1:43:45] your what God's cultivating beef why you
[1:43:52] are his workmanship in Christ Jesus for
[1:43:55] gained unto good works that you should
[1:43:58] walk in them he's building something
[1:44:03] he's growing something he's husband
[1:44:07] dreamed something not for here he's
[1:44:13] building us here for there and he says
[1:44:21] he says you are you are God's building
[1:44:24] now according to the grace of God which
[1:44:29] is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder
[1:44:33] I have laid the foundation another
[1:44:39] buildeth thereon but let every man take
[1:44:43] heed how he buildeth there upon good
[1:44:51] question see we we leave the take heed
[1:45:00] the take heed goes out of our lives and
[1:45:07] you know get it it striking you know
[1:45:11] I've been you know I'm 70 now you know
[1:45:15] that so this idea of retirement
[1:45:17] it floats by me and it's tough I don't
[1:45:26] know you know I've got to take heed you
[1:45:30] think oh now you can just lay it down oh
[1:45:32] you can't lay this down you can't lay
[1:45:35] this we can't quit running this race we
[1:45:40] can't take the take heat out of our life
[1:45:43] we can't take the watch what how they're
[1:45:46] on how you be
[1:45:47] we can't take we're going to be rewarded
[1:45:50] according to how we build there's one
[1:45:57] thing you're going to take with you and
[1:45:58] that's your character and it's an
[1:46:03] individual affair it's a consciousness I
[1:46:06] want to say this is money it's a
[1:46:08] building it's assembling the parts in us
[1:46:11] just like the statue of a perfect man he
[1:46:15] talked about how God was building the
[1:46:17] church how God was building the church
[1:46:19] up how it was coming to the capstone he
[1:46:22] says he also builds the individual the
[1:46:26] same way maybe you notice even in the
[1:46:31] statute of the perfect man he's always
[1:46:33] putting you in the process he says don't
[1:46:40] go to the next step until you have this
[1:46:43] don't have it till this is perfected
[1:46:48] it's the understanding that I want us to
[1:46:51] understand this morning we can't sit
[1:46:54] back and and rest in the completion of
[1:47:03] the message don't misunderstand me it's
[1:47:10] like having the blueprint the wise
[1:47:13] master builder gives you the blueprint
[1:47:15] and you say I've got the blueprint
[1:47:19] therefore I have the building it's like
[1:47:24] a seed you say I have the corn seed
[1:47:29] therefore I have the corn potentially
[1:47:33] yes you have the building if you
[1:47:38] assemble the parts if you put the parts
[1:47:45] together you have the building
[1:47:48] if you plant the seed and you water the
[1:47:54] seed and you read it and you dung it and
[1:47:57] you
[1:47:58] the theta produces what the seed was
[1:48:01] predestinated to do so it doesn't it
[1:48:08] doesn't lie in the blueprint it lies in
[1:48:13] the manifestation of the blueprint in
[1:48:17] every stage that's the place you've got
[1:48:20] to add the extra that's the place you've
[1:48:23] got to work on it sometimes you've got
[1:48:25] to do it more than one time it's work
[1:48:33] it's labor let's look at Corinthians
[1:48:40] five
[1:48:52] I'm sorry it's 2nd Corinthians 5 forgive
[1:48:57] me
[1:49:07] it says for we know that if our earthly
[1:49:11] house of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:49:15] we have a building of God and the house
[1:49:20] not made with hands eternal in the
[1:49:24] heavens
[1:49:26] now we know that if this earthly
[1:49:30] tabernacle be dissolved we have a
[1:49:32] building of God so when this earthly
[1:49:38] Tabernacle be dissolved what you have
[1:49:41] left is what God has built that is what
[1:49:46] goes to that other tabernacle that's
[1:49:53] what he wants to build that's what he's
[1:49:55] building Ephesians just to lay a little
[1:50:02] scriptural Ephesians 2:19 through 22 I
[1:50:13] believe I always like to go up and read
[1:50:21] a verse or two before and that verse
[1:50:28] says but through him we both have access
[1:50:30] by one spirit unto the Father so let's
[1:50:35] read in Ephesians will give our
[1:50:36] interpreters a chance to find it in
[1:50:39] their Bibles it says now therefore ye
[1:50:47] are no more strangers and foreigners but
[1:50:50] fellow-citizens with the Saints and in
[1:50:57] the household of God and are built upon
[1:51:03] the foundations of the
[1:51:06] Parcells prophets Jesus Christ Himself
[1:51:09] being the chief Cornerstone
[1:51:13] in other words ye are built you are put
[1:51:17] together with certain parts those parts
[1:51:24] are like the fruits of the spirit you
[1:51:28] are put together with patience and
[1:51:30] temperance and meekness and
[1:51:33] long-suffering and gentleness and
[1:51:36] kindness you are put together with the
[1:51:42] fruits of the spirit you are put
[1:51:47] together with the that will the
[1:51:51] attributes of God that he's built you
[1:51:55] and and and put you together and that's
[1:52:01] why he said take heed what's you're
[1:52:03] building what are you building me are
[1:52:06] you building with the things and the
[1:52:08] material that God supplies there's a
[1:52:13] story in the construction world that is
[1:52:19] told and it was about a builder a great
[1:52:24] builder in California who built houses
[1:52:29] for the movie stars and and the
[1:52:34] politicians and the wealthy people and
[1:52:39] he built some fabulous homes and he
[1:52:42] would purchase fabulous properties and
[1:52:44] build these homes but the work was done
[1:52:49] really by his superintendent he was the
[1:52:54] person that got the contractors out
[1:52:56] there he was the person that actually is
[1:52:59] in charge of the physical building the
[1:53:02] Builder people I say too sometimes the
[1:53:04] people I'm a builder and they look at me
[1:53:06] like well did you frame it did you put
[1:53:08] the windows did you paint it no I'm into
[1:53:10] a thing I talked the bank into giving me
[1:53:15] the money that's a builder
[1:53:19] so this man did the labor he did all the
[1:53:24] work he did everything and in his heart
[1:53:33] he began to get bitter you know felt
[1:53:37] unappreciative and and those things yet
[1:53:41] he was paid well well one day the boss
[1:53:45] handed him a set of blueprints and said
[1:53:48] go build this house on that lot there
[1:53:50] you know that really good lot we have
[1:53:52] overlooking the ocean I said here you go
[1:53:55] build this so he took that set of
[1:53:59] blueprints and he went out there and you
[1:54:03] know his heart wasn't right anymore
[1:54:05] he lost the motive and objective he lost
[1:54:09] the purpose of what he was doing so he
[1:54:11] caught out there and he ordered the
[1:54:13] cheapest concrete he could instead of
[1:54:16] putting rebar be put wire in this lab
[1:54:20] and instead of digging the piers three
[1:54:23] and four feet deep he dug them two feet
[1:54:25] deep he cheaped out the foundation
[1:54:30] instead of putting the best plumbing in
[1:54:33] and putting vents for every bathroom and
[1:54:35] every device over the house he just put
[1:54:37] one or two vents here and there and when
[1:54:40] it came to framing it instead of
[1:54:42] building it on 16 inch centers you know
[1:54:46] which means there would be a 2 by 4 here
[1:54:48] and a 2 by 4 here and a 2 by 4 here so
[1:54:51] instead of having five two four by fours
[1:54:54] don't do the math for every four feet he
[1:54:58] put him on two foot centers instead of
[1:55:03] putting two by twelves he put two by
[1:55:05] tens instead of putting the inch and 1/4
[1:55:09] plywood on the upstairs like they
[1:55:12] normally did he put happy and he just
[1:55:14] built this house just cheap then he put
[1:55:19] facade instead of putting real brick he
[1:55:22] put face Bracken on and on it went
[1:55:26] instead of putting a thirty-year
[1:55:28] lifetime roof he put a 25-year
[1:55:31] find it one day he walked into the
[1:55:35] office and he laid the boot prints down
[1:55:37] and and he looked at the boss he said
[1:55:45] the house is done he says is it just the
[1:55:48] way you wanted it did you build it the
[1:55:53] way that you know how to build is it
[1:55:57] everything that you wanted it to be said
[1:56:00] yes boss
[1:56:03] deal and I reach it in this drawer and
[1:56:06] he pulled out the keys and he said Bob
[1:56:09] you've been faithful to me all these
[1:56:12] years this is your house and he threw
[1:56:18] him the keys now he knew it he built he
[1:56:27] just got a cheap shoddy half-wit put
[1:56:33] together job what are you building what
[1:56:37] are you gonna live in what are when are
[1:56:40] you laying for a foundation are you
[1:56:43] taking heed to what you're going to take
[1:56:45] with you could you imagine if he would
[1:56:51] have painstakingly went about that the
[1:56:54] way he went about business you know what
[1:56:56] but he got tired he got tired of working
[1:57:02] without reward he got tired with working
[1:57:05] without recognition he got tired of the
[1:57:08] same routine day in and day out he got
[1:57:12] tired of what he was building are we
[1:57:15] getting tired of what we're building
[1:57:18] what we're working for what we're
[1:57:21] laboring to there's there's so many
[1:57:28] beautiful scriptures that are spoken of
[1:57:37] about
[1:57:39] the body we are one body
[1:57:44] we're baptized by one spirit Corinthians
[1:57:47] 12 and 12 and 13 what we're building
[1:57:52] so the question even comes back to us is
[1:57:58] what we're building not only what we're
[1:58:04] building as a as individuals and I would
[1:58:10] gone into deeper lengthen in Corinthians
[1:58:14] 12 explaining to you that we're a body
[1:58:17] fitted and joined together a member
[1:58:19] member body but yet one body
[1:58:21] each meant member of that body supplying
[1:58:24] the need to the other which brings it
[1:58:28] back to the individual so if we're a
[1:58:30] body of believers and every individual
[1:58:34] isn't supplying a hundred percent then
[1:58:40] that body becomes weak if that
[1:58:44] individual is weak then the body is weak
[1:58:49] but that's also a part of the body when
[1:58:54] one's weak you which are strong oh we
[1:59:01] don't want to be connected anymore
[1:59:04] we don't want to be a part of anything
[1:59:07] anymore we all want to live our own
[1:59:09] lives as lady osya the lady osseous
[1:59:13] spirit has taken hold all this great big
[1:59:17] virus thing did to me was it manifested
[1:59:20] to me the attitude of lady osya that
[1:59:23] leaves deep into the hearts of the
[1:59:26] people you know when I heard that a lot
[1:59:34] of people on Easter morning went and
[1:59:36] listened to other people and and and you
[1:59:39] know picked me up later you know at
[1:59:41] first I was a little jealous and then I
[1:59:46] thought oh god I'm nothing anyway boo
[1:59:51] but why does
[1:59:53] bother me it shouldn't bother me it's
[1:59:56] the word that's not the part that ended
[2:00:00] up by me the part is are we a body or
[2:00:03] are we not a body are we here one for
[2:00:09] another or are we not here one for
[2:00:12] another do we pray for one another do we
[2:00:15] bear one another's burdens are we fitted
[2:00:18] and joined together supplied the need
[2:00:20] what is it that we are building I
[2:00:27] certainly don't want to manifest the the
[2:00:32] spirit of the pastor I want us to
[2:00:38] manifest the fruits of the Living God
[2:00:42] for we are the building of God the
[2:00:45] habitation the scripture says of the
[2:00:48] Spirit we are the building that he's
[2:00:53] building and every building it has got
[2:00:58] to have a foundation and we know what
[2:01:04] the foundation is it's faith it's
[2:01:11] revelation it's faith is the increase of
[2:01:19] God in a man's life does faith and
[2:01:24] revelation are the same thing when you
[2:01:27] were a child you did as a child but when
[2:01:32] you've grown you come to greater
[2:01:34] abilities and greater strength and
[2:01:36] greater burdens I love seeing the
[2:01:41] grandchildren just playing in the yard
[2:01:43] and they running up and they swing and
[2:01:47] they do this and they do back and and we
[2:01:52] sit back and we think oh they don't have
[2:01:55] a care in the world but then you start
[2:01:58] to see them grow up I'm watching our
[2:02:04] young people
[2:02:06] they begin to grow up and they start to
[2:02:09] get married and you know the burdens and
[2:02:11] life and raising children and providing
[2:02:14] it for them in how you live your life
[2:02:17] but you know all through that life God's
[2:02:21] building something for their and we have
[2:02:28] got to take heed of how we built our
[2:02:31] circumstances our jobs our financial
[2:02:35] status our likes and dislikes have not
[2:02:40] the bearing nor should it have an effect
[2:02:44] on the spiritual man that we're building
[2:02:53] well you've got to remain conscious of
[2:02:56] that you've got to contend with yourself
[2:03:01] I'd like to just close maybe in reading
[2:03:05] to you out of a message things that are
[2:03:13] to be blurb and says as you begin to see
[2:03:17] the days of your life drawing close then
[2:03:23] it begins you begin to packed up closer
[2:03:28] getting ready for that great event are
[2:03:34] we seeing the days of the resurrection
[2:03:38] coming closer I don't know how many more
[2:03:42] signs God's got to give us but man can
[2:03:51] wipe themselves off the face of the
[2:03:54] earth whether they do it out of a
[2:03:57] lavatory by a disease by a poison by a
[2:04:01] bomb whatever they do you it's obvious
[2:04:04] to us that man has the ability to kill
[2:04:07] themselves all you have to do is go back
[2:04:10] to the annihilation of the Jews to
[2:04:13] Cambodia to do the killing fields in the
[2:04:16] South America and all those places where
[2:04:19] man has absolutely committed genocide on
[2:04:23] generations you ought to go back to the
[2:04:25] breakup of Yugoslavia and Macedonia and
[2:04:28] Albania
[2:04:29] ok and what what took place over there
[2:04:35] but we don't look we're not looking at
[2:04:43] the blueprint I'm just preaching I'm not
[2:04:46] preaching at you we don't look at the
[2:04:50] blueprint we don't can recognize the day
[2:04:55] in its message we don't look at the
[2:04:57] clock we don't realize that that things
[2:05:03] are transpiring all around us we can
[2:05:08] become so locked up in our world that
[2:05:12] we're not preparing for the great event
[2:05:15] ask yourself is the great event coming
[2:05:18] or is it not because if it's not we have
[2:05:22] all men are most miserable we might as
[2:05:29] well become Epicureans eat drink and be
[2:05:36] merry for tomorrow we shall die I don't
[2:05:42] want to take my chances at the river
[2:05:49] that's a quote I don't want to get to
[2:05:54] the river and wonder what's in my
[2:05:59] luggage I was talking to my friend that
[2:06:09] owns a restaurant he said I went over to
[2:06:10] my country and they stopped me at the
[2:06:13] border and they they said you've got
[2:06:16] meth off feta means in your suitcase
[2:06:24] that's going to cost you cuz I ain't
[2:06:27] give me a penny he said you go search it
[2:06:31] he had glasses I'm not glass glasses
[2:06:36] drinking glasses
[2:06:37] he said search it tear it apart I know
[2:06:42] what I brought I don't want to be
[2:06:47] packing contraband at the river I don't
[2:06:51] want to be packing malice or envy or
[2:06:54] strife the prophet of God said I don't
[2:07:00] want to be packing smut don't get smut
[2:07:02] it up I don't want to be packed in
[2:07:06] jealousy I want to have nothing in my
[2:07:13] building that isn't him because listen
[2:07:19] to this very carefully getting ready for
[2:07:24] that great event it's it's a continuing
[2:07:29] of this same life in another world
[2:07:35] another place oh we got such an idea
[2:07:42] that that was from things that are to be
[2:07:46] we ought to read that book I'm going to
[2:07:50] quote again in closing but we have such
[2:07:55] an idea we live this life we do the best
[2:07:57] we can and then when it's over we go to
[2:08:03] the judgment and our lives are put on
[2:08:08] the scale of good and evil and if we've
[2:08:13] done more good than evil we make it when
[2:08:20] I went to school I had one goal that was
[2:08:24] get Addie
[2:08:30] that's not a very good goal barely get
[2:08:34] by I grew up in my life of what of
[2:08:40] facing the consequences when you got
[2:08:44] there
[2:08:45] no pre-planning no understanding
[2:08:48] whatever happened happened tonight I
[2:08:50] want to party fine tomorrow will take
[2:08:53] care of itself
[2:08:54] you understand that we're called to take
[2:08:57] care of tomorrow the you worry about the
[2:09:01] evil of the day when I say take no
[2:09:03] thought of tomorrow that was to the
[2:09:07] carnal things not to the spiritual thing
[2:09:14] because we have no tomorrow on the
[2:09:16] spiritual we've already passed from life
[2:09:25] from death unto life we're already
[2:09:28] sitting in heavenly places in Christ
[2:09:31] Jesus
[2:09:32] we're possessors of resurrection he says
[2:09:39] it's just he says it's just a
[2:09:41] continuation of the same life in another
[2:09:45] place now that's what we're we want to
[2:09:50] realize is that we're we're building not
[2:09:58] for this world but for a world to come
[2:10:05] that's why we sacrifice in this world
[2:10:09] for that world where a man's heart is
[2:10:13] there are as treasures also we can read
[2:10:20] the parables there's 46 parables and I
[2:10:26] believe there's a principle in every
[2:10:29] parable some something that Jesus was
[2:10:37] trying to get across to us
[2:10:43] that we would build the right thing that
[2:10:48] we would possess the right thing we're
[2:10:55] not talking about salvation we're
[2:11:01] talking about obtaining a position in
[2:11:06] the gospel that's for ordained to us by
[2:11:11] the Lord we are his workmanship for
[2:11:18] ordained unto good works that we should
[2:11:22] walk in them what I'm saying that egg
[2:11:25] wouldn't be taken by you might say a
[2:11:29] nominal believer it wouldn't be taken to
[2:11:34] heart by somebody that feels that well
[2:11:39] and I know these are lines that are
[2:11:43] going to be misinterpreted but that the
[2:11:51] Lord just going to take care of
[2:11:52] everything I'm telling you that's God
[2:11:57] always working from the outside but God
[2:12:01] works from the inside out like that Lily
[2:12:07] that Lily had that beautiful flower in
[2:12:10] it but it had to worked its way through
[2:12:15] the mud and through the crime it had to
[2:12:18] push up it had to keep striving for the
[2:12:21] light if it had to keep following the
[2:12:25] courts until it broke on top of the
[2:12:28] water and it radiated all the glory that
[2:12:32] God put in it in seed form it can't stop
[2:12:39] along the way it's got to finish his
[2:12:45] journey and it's got to it's got to work
[2:12:50] hard it's got to build it's got to put
[2:12:54] the things in place
[2:12:56] to construct the question is what are we
[2:13:03] building faith is our foundation faith
[2:13:10] one for another faith for the things of
[2:13:12] God faith for the word of God good we
[2:13:15] ought to be a Church of faith that
[2:13:16] believes all things are possible that
[2:13:19] God can do exceedingly abundantly in our
[2:13:22] midst above that which we can ask for
[2:13:25] thing faith this has the ability to
[2:13:29] recognize the hand of God when it moves
[2:13:37] of faith that when the singer sings a
[2:13:44] song and the solemn is read and then you
[2:13:49] begin to see how they all fit together
[2:13:51] how they all had the same theme how the
[2:13:54] Spirit of God is moving you see well
[2:13:57] this is God God's in our midst
[2:14:00] is there two people here that came this
[2:14:04] morning in his name he's here he's here
[2:14:08] by promise he's here because he cannot
[2:14:13] lie are are we here and believe that all
[2:14:20] things are possible
[2:14:24] Satan's building to you realize that
[2:14:26] he's building an Eden
[2:14:28] he's building the kingdom he's offering
[2:14:33] jobs
[2:14:35] he needs staff what he said I didn't say
[2:14:45] he said it said he needs staff he needs
[2:14:49] men and women Sunday School teachers
[2:14:51] people to step up people to make it work
[2:14:53] people to make it happen well Satan does
[2:14:58] too
[2:15:03] God's got a plan
[2:15:05] you believe that your faith is that
[2:15:09] you've been elected and chosen by God to
[2:15:17] be that bride we call ourselves the
[2:15:27] bride God's given me a good bride more
[2:15:37] than I deserve and and in those of you
[2:15:40] that know her no that's true I've
[2:15:44] received a lot of criticism I very very
[2:15:47] very rarely in fact have ever received
[2:15:52] much criticism about Leslie the only
[2:15:59] thing I say is that I would have told
[2:16:01] you that I picked or but God or even
[2:16:04] arranged that were the bride
[2:16:15] so what we're building is a bride what
[2:16:24] we're building is something that he's
[2:16:26] going to take home to father something
[2:16:33] that he's going to meet at the river and
[2:16:37] recognize as his something that he's
[2:16:43] going to see the attributes in that
[2:16:48] represent what he loves and what he
[2:16:53] walks with and what he talks with and
[2:16:56] what he has union with that's what we're
[2:17:02] building we're building the character
[2:17:06] and the representation of what we are
[2:17:12] going to be there
[2:17:16] I don't want to live on the side of the
[2:17:22] mountain those who have no future home I
[2:17:30] don't want to go in and out of the gates
[2:17:34] holding the leaf of the tree
[2:17:40] representing peace for those who are
[2:17:45] from studied future home I want to live
[2:17:50] in the city where the lamb is the light
[2:17:58] my call wasn't salvation which God gives
[2:18:06] every man as he so chooses
[2:18:10] he maketh one vessel unto honor and
[2:18:13] other to a dishonor but I don't believe
[2:18:18] that's our call I don't believe that's
[2:18:21] what we're building
[2:18:22] I believe we're trying to build an
[2:18:26] elective a Christian character a
[2:18:32] manifestation of himself in flesh
[2:18:36] I believe that's what we're building but
[2:18:39] let me tell you again it's building it's
[2:18:43] work it's putting together all the parts
[2:18:46] and have we quit putting the parts
[2:18:50] together in our life and we quit adding
[2:18:55] have we quit growing the fruits of the
[2:18:58] spirit have we quit meeting the
[2:19:01] challenge you know we say we live by the
[2:19:03] word when you live by the word you're
[2:19:05] living by a person you're not living by
[2:19:09] a book you're living by a person and
[2:19:14] when you meet a challenge you meet that
[2:19:18] challenge with your flesh your
[2:19:22] upbringing your knowledge your
[2:19:25] personality and you have an opera
[2:19:29] you meet that challenge in the flesh or
[2:19:31] to die and meet that challenge with his
[2:19:36] personality his attributes in his word
[2:19:41] that's how it's built that's what it
[2:19:44] means to live by the Word of God means
[2:19:46] to live by him to live by his nature to
[2:19:51] live by his spirit to live by his
[2:19:53] character his attributes the things that
[2:19:57] he is patience meekness temperance to
[2:20:00] face every event with that manifestation
[2:20:06] in our hearts in our lives and I'll read
[2:20:09] this and I hope that you can understand
[2:20:13] then that take heed and once again
[2:20:18] understand that we're preparing for
[2:20:23] something we're not building something
[2:20:26] here we're putting together a spiritual
[2:20:30] body for their individual body the hand
[2:20:36] can't say to the foot I have no need of
[2:20:39] thee or the I to the other I have no
[2:20:44] need of thee we can't say that we don't
[2:20:48] need each other we can't say that we're
[2:20:54] I've got I've got my tapes I've got my
[2:20:57] books I've got my Bible I don't need
[2:20:59] anything that's not in the books it's
[2:21:02] not in the Bible it's not in God's plan
[2:21:05] that's not the way he made it he made us
[2:21:10] members in particular fitted and joined
[2:21:13] together you'll never change that you
[2:21:17] will never never never change that you
[2:21:23] are meant to serve one another you are
[2:21:29] called you weren't made perfect you
[2:21:31] weren't saved perfect when he caught a
[2:21:36] fish it wasn't already skinned and
[2:21:38] cleaned ready to fry I don't go to the
[2:21:41] lake and sit
[2:21:43] there with my frying pan and my oil hot
[2:21:47] waiting to roll up a breaded fillet and
[2:21:52] throw it into thing oh that's what what
[2:21:55] that's what Christianity's become no you
[2:21:59] work at it go back and when I was a
[2:22:01] little child when I was a child let's
[2:22:03] just read now close I hope that somehow
[2:22:08] this can be expressed see you are all
[2:22:14] pleep pre-planned by God
[2:22:17] nothing happens by chance with God he
[2:22:22] knows all about it
[2:22:24] it's all pre-planned plan for many
[2:22:28] generations back so that you could be
[2:22:32] here tonight did you know that just
[2:22:39] think that you at one time and I'll
[2:22:44] repeat this again
[2:22:47] you at one time was in your father in
[2:22:52] the gene of your father now he didn't
[2:22:57] know you at at that time neither did you
[2:23:03] know him at that time but you see then
[2:23:08] you were put in the bedding ground in
[2:23:10] the mother's womb through the holy
[2:23:13] wedlock and then you become a person
[2:23:17] expressed in the image of your father
[2:23:21] then there's fellowship now the only way
[2:23:28] that you can be a son or daughter of God
[2:23:33] because you have to be they have to have
[2:23:40] eternal light and there's only one form
[2:23:43] of eternal life and that's God's life
[2:23:47] and only one form of eternal life that
[2:23:51] was God there to be a son of God
[2:23:56] you had to be in him always the gene of
[2:24:01] your life spiritual life tonight was in
[2:24:06] God the Father before there even was a
[2:24:11] molecule now just think what you're
[2:24:17] building see and you are nothing but the
[2:24:24] manifestation of the gene of life that
[2:24:27] was in God as a son of God and daughters
[2:24:32] of God do you place yourself there also
[2:24:35] now you're expressed after his word has
[2:24:43] come in you to light up this age you are
[2:24:48] the expressing God's life in you because
[2:24:55] you are a son or a daughter of God
[2:24:57] therefore you get what I mean you you
[2:25:02] are now made your sitting in this church
[2:25:07] tonight because your duty is to express
[2:25:12] God to this nation and this people and
[2:25:19] this neighborhood where you are
[2:25:22] associated that's your duty the question
[2:25:27] is what are you building what you're
[2:25:30] building is your expression that's what
[2:25:34] you're building he has the plan he gives
[2:25:38] the material but you build it you add it
[2:25:44] you put it in your life when you see
[2:25:47] you're lacking you go to the material
[2:25:49] and you get it where you had a
[2:25:51] two-by-four and you need a 2x6
[2:25:55] you go get it you take that 2x4 out of
[2:25:59] your life and you replace it when you
[2:26:04] find out you've got a beam in your eye
[2:26:06] and you're trying to remove a sling
[2:26:12] you go get the beam out of your own eye
[2:26:21] God knew that you would be here because
[2:26:24] you have to be one of his genes or his
[2:26:27] attributes you had to be if if you've
[2:26:33] got eternal life then you always had
[2:26:37] eternal life and God before there was a
[2:26:41] foundation of the world knew that you
[2:26:44] would be here so you have eternal life
[2:26:48] that life is his gene but the job is to
[2:26:55] express that gene is to build that gene
[2:26:59] it's to work and build with the Word of
[2:27:05] God
[2:27:05] building the plan that God has
[2:27:08] pre-planned in you don't quit keep
[2:27:14] building it may not look that much but
[2:27:19] when he's done it'll be his image you be
[2:27:28] he said you've got eternal life you
[2:27:33] always always was eternal life and God
[2:27:37] before there was a foundation of the
[2:27:39] world knew that you would be here and
[2:27:43] when the word or the water the washing
[2:27:48] of the water of the word fell upon you
[2:27:52] you was expressed in a being now you
[2:27:58] have fellowship with your father God
[2:28:02] just as you have with your earthly
[2:28:05] father see you are citizens of the
[2:28:10] kingdom not citizens but you are
[2:28:15] children sons and daughters of the
[2:28:19] Living God if it be
[2:28:23] that eternal life dwells in you now then
[2:28:27] if it was Jesus was the fullness of God
[2:28:32] manifested he was the fullness of the
[2:28:36] Godhead bodily therefore when he came to
[2:28:40] the earth he was the manifestation in
[2:28:43] the flesh you are here in him then
[2:28:48] because he was the word in the beginning
[2:28:52] was the word in the Word was with God in
[2:28:54] the Word was God and the Word was made
[2:28:57] flesh and dwelt among us you see the
[2:29:01] same principle that God used in Christ
[2:29:06] he has to use that same principle in you
[2:29:11] if he was in the word in the word was
[2:29:15] made flesh
[2:29:16] you were the word and you were made
[2:29:19] flesh if he learned obedience by the
[2:29:23] things that he suffered and he only
[2:29:28] didn't do anything till the father
[2:29:32] revealed it to him and he knew what
[2:29:35] cause he came into this world was to
[2:29:38] redeem us that he could take us and then
[2:29:42] he sent his spirit back that that spirit
[2:29:45] would lead us and guide us into all
[2:29:47] truth and righteousness that it would
[2:29:50] bring us into the image of his son that
[2:29:52] we could be conformed to the image of
[2:29:55] his son that if the same spirit dwelt in
[2:29:59] Jesus Christ dwell in us it will quicken
[2:30:03] our mortal bodies also another he knew
[2:30:09] and he learned obedience because what he
[2:30:16] was created now you are sons and
[2:30:19] daughters of God also you were
[2:30:22] pre-planned you were in the beginning
[2:30:25] and he put that seed in flesh
[2:30:31] now he sent his spirit to transform that
[2:30:35] flesh through the building of the Holy
[2:30:39] Spirit and the building of a perfect man
[2:30:42] watching you resurrect out of the human
[2:30:46] flesh into the image of the Living God
[2:30:49] the attributes of God displayed the
[2:30:52] nature of God display the way that God
[2:30:55] thinks the prophet of God said be like
[2:30:57] God but you work on that you build that
[2:31:06] by being in fellowship just like a
[2:31:10] father and adoption raises his children
[2:31:14] until they can take over the job
[2:31:21] how many wants to take over the job of
[2:31:28] being Christ to the world the word was
[2:31:37] made flesh therefore you walked with him
[2:31:41] you were in him when he was on earth you
[2:31:46] suffered with him and you died with him
[2:31:49] you are buried with him and now you're
[2:31:52] risen with him and manifested attributes
[2:31:56] of God setting in heavenly places
[2:31:59] already raised resurrected the new life
[2:32:03] and setting in heavenly places in Christ
[2:32:07] Jesus oh that means so much nowadays
[2:32:11] Church that means so much to us to see
[2:32:16] our positioning we placed in Christ
[2:32:21] Jesus now if we are those attributes of
[2:32:26] God we cannot live by Creed's our own
[2:32:35] Creed's
[2:32:39] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[2:32:44] must live by the word because the bride
[2:32:48] is part of the bridegroom like any wife
[2:32:52] is part of her husband therefore we must
[2:32:56] be that word bride want you to listen to
[2:33:04] the next statement we must be that word
[2:33:10] bride what is that word bride the
[2:33:19] manifestation of this our the bride not
[2:33:23] a creed or denomination but a living
[2:33:27] Oracle of God and living attributes of
[2:33:32] God displaying to the world the
[2:33:35] attributes of God in the formation of
[2:33:39] the bride that's to be expressed in this
[2:33:43] hour that we're now living what are we
[2:33:50] building we are building that bride what
[2:33:56] are we building we are building that
[2:33:59] manifestation some are young just our
[2:34:04] children they need your help they can't
[2:34:09] walk on their own they need you to raise
[2:34:11] them in the admonition of Christ to in
[2:34:14] spit in their lives the principles of
[2:34:16] honesty the principles of integrity the
[2:34:21] principles of righteousness they need to
[2:34:23] see you as a burning example of fervency
[2:34:27] for God reading your Bibles praying
[2:34:29] family devotion they've got to be raised
[2:34:35] we have Sunday School where our Sunday
[2:34:39] School teachers help them to learn their
[2:34:41] scriptures and their Bibles along with
[2:34:44] you at home we gathered together for
[2:34:47] instruction in the correction and
[2:34:49] righteousness
[2:34:52] some are young teenagers some are going
[2:34:54] through the challenges of being tempted
[2:34:56] growing through the the times of life
[2:34:59] and where their their desires and their
[2:35:02] nature changes where boys begin to look
[2:35:05] at girls and girls begin to look at boys
[2:35:08] they need guidance in those time they
[2:35:10] need faith in that time they need prayer
[2:35:12] in that time they need a body they need
[2:35:20] people that there are goal in their
[2:35:23] heart is to have this Lord manifested
[2:35:28] we're not going to get by on history
[2:35:34] you're not going to present anybody else
[2:35:39] you're not going to present Paul you're
[2:35:41] not going to present
[2:35:42] Wesley Luther you're not going to
[2:35:44] present the seventh Age messenger what
[2:35:47] you're going to present it that day is
[2:35:49] your self and what you have built and
[2:35:53] whether or not you are the inhabitation
[2:35:57] of God you think that's easy being in
[2:36:01] the flesh no you've got to build it
[2:36:04] you've got to work on it you've got to
[2:36:07] add to it every day because that's what
[2:36:11] the bride is she's the manifestation of
[2:36:15] a people that have growed in the
[2:36:18] maturity and I believe with all my heart
[2:36:22] that we understand that God sent a
[2:36:27] prophet we understand that the seals
[2:36:30] have been opened we understand the
[2:36:33] position as he said in that book that
[2:36:36] people don't believe in me when I preach
[2:36:38] the eternal security of the believer but
[2:36:43] faith is expressed it's works expressed
[2:36:50] it's what he put in you coming to
[2:36:53] maturity and flowering out that the
[2:36:57] world can see that he planted a bride
[2:37:00] and he has a bride and she lives by him
[2:37:04] she looks like
[2:37:06] him she acts like him and when he sees
[2:37:10] her they see him because these two are
[2:37:18] one flesh father I pray that they may be
[2:37:23] one as we are lying
[2:37:26] let's not forget what we're building I
[2:37:29] know we got building plans but that's
[2:37:32] not the church we want to build we want
[2:37:35] to build this body this faith these
[2:37:39] virtues we want to get rid of the malice
[2:37:44] the envy the backbiting the lust that
[2:37:46] those they ruin a clean house we want to
[2:37:49] apply the token we want to be fitted
[2:37:52] enjoying together like real godly loving
[2:37:56] people that love one another that the
[2:37:59] very personality of the Lord Jesus
[2:38:02] shines through us Jesus was the
[2:38:06] personality of God he who has seen me
[2:38:10] has seen the father he who has seen you
[2:38:16] have seen the message of the hour have
[2:38:21] seen the true Spirit of God the
[2:38:24] revelation of the word yes it'll be so
[2:38:28] close in the last days to deceive the
[2:38:32] very elect if possible that's my
[2:38:39] favorite part of that scripture I used
[2:38:46] to pride myself and not being deceived
[2:38:49] boy was i deceived work labor build look
[2:38:59] at your life what are you building

[2:51:40] [Music]
[2:52:24] god bless you this morning our sister
[2:52:27] was moved to want to do what's right and
[2:52:30] I'm sure that this being Mother's Day
[2:52:32] meant a lot to her and we'll go straight
[2:52:36] to the scriptures the water is cold if
[2:52:39] you have not experienced the cold water
[2:52:41] we sure invite you to do so because we
[2:52:45] want everyone to be baptized in the name
[2:52:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ because it's
[2:52:49] the scriptural thing to do we know the
[2:52:52] story the Spirit of God fell it today at
[2:52:54] Pentecost men came out of the Upper Room
[2:52:58] new creatures filled with the power of
[2:53:00] God what they didn't have before they
[2:53:03] now had because Jesus Christ had
[2:53:05] returned to the church in spirit form
[2:53:09] and took his abode in the believer and
[2:53:13] when they saw this power manifested they
[2:53:15] were moved and the Peter spoke he said
[2:53:19] therefore let all the house of Israel
[2:53:21] know assuredly that God hath made the
[2:53:26] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[2:53:29] Lord and Christ now when they heard this
[2:53:33] they were pricked in their heart and
[2:53:35] said unto Peter and the rest of the
[2:53:37] Apostles men and brethren what shall we
[2:53:40] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[2:53:44] be baptized every one of you in the name
[2:53:47] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[2:53:50] sins that ye shall receive the gift of
[2:53:55] the Holy Ghost for this promise is unto
[2:53:58] you and your children and to all that
[2:54:01] are afar off even as many as our Lord
[2:54:05] our God shall call and with many other
[2:54:07] words did he testify and exhort saying
[2:54:10] save yourself from this up courts
[2:54:12] generation I've seen this promise come
[2:54:16] to pass sometimes it took years but I've
[2:54:22] seen those that have been baptized in
[2:54:24] the name of Lord Jesus Christ one day
[2:54:26] come to being filled with the Holy
[2:54:28] Spirit and I'm glad she has this mild
[2:54:31] stone in her life so when she goes forth
[2:54:34] there's a part of her
[2:54:36] has the Word of God fulfilled I believe
[2:54:39] it'll keep her she's got wonderful
[2:54:41] parents she's being raced what she's
[2:54:43] going to make a lovely Christian I think
[2:54:46] it's going to be what's beautiful to
[2:54:48] watch her grow in the eyes of the Lord
[2:54:50] amen jesus said I suffered the little
[2:55:03] ones to come unto me and father for such
[2:55:07] as the kingdom of God made were also
[2:55:10] father admonished to become like little
[2:55:13] children father she desires to be

[2:55:19] world baptizing in the name of the
[2:55:21] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:55:24] and with the keys to the kingdom Peter
[2:55:26] having that revelation what that name
[2:55:29] was it was the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:55:31] Christ according to the scriptures we
