[36:09] truly you are the answer lord
[36:12] where the world fails and the doctors
[36:14] fail when our own minds fail you are the
[36:16] answer
[36:18] lord we've come here tonight
[36:20] that we would come to your throne of
[36:22] grace lord that you would
[36:25] look down upon us
[36:27] with favor
[36:28] but even beyond that lord we don't look
[36:30] to you as a god that's a far off
[36:32] you're a god that's right here in our
[36:35] midst
[36:36] and because we have received this
[36:37] message lord we know that we are highly
[36:40] favored among women we are highly
[36:43] favored just as mary was highly favored
[36:46] your bride in this end time has received
[36:48] a word and been impregnated by your very
[36:51] word of life lord and so we come to you
[36:54] with thanksgiving in our heart lord just
[36:56] to tell you that we love you that we
[36:58] thank you that we worship you that we
[37:00] adore you all worthy is the lamb that
[37:03] was slain worthy is the lamb lord we
[37:06] thank you father that we're not
[37:08] worshiping a god of 2000 years ago but
[37:11] we're worshiping a god that's right here
[37:13] present amongst us who knows what we
[37:15] have need of lord you know the secrets
[37:17] of our heart lord and we ask that you
[37:19] had come because you were the same
[37:21] yesterday today and forever that you
[37:22] would discern the very thoughts and
[37:24] intents of our heart not that a man
[37:26] could do that but by the preaching of
[37:28] the word we know lord jesus that your
[37:30] word is sharper than to any two-edged
[37:32] sword lord we love you lord we thank you
[37:35] for the gathering we think of those that
[37:37] aren't with us our pastor and sister
[37:39] leslie pray that you be their portion
[37:41] lord many that aren't with us those that
[37:43] are sick and body are our brother burly
[37:45] father oh we're just looking forward to
[37:47] a great mighty report that there be no
[37:49] loss of vision
[37:50] lord as that nail went into his eye from
[37:52] that nail gun oh lord you know in my
[37:54] heart i cried out lord and we cry out
[37:56] together father you said we have not
[37:58] because we asked not lord we're asking
[38:01] that there would be no vision impairment
[38:03] lord there would be a quick healing
[38:04] father that there would be a great
[38:06] testimony that would go forth of your
[38:08] healing virtue lord how we love you how
[38:10] we thank you lord and right now we know
[38:12] that we're seated in the place where all
[38:14] things are possible father and
[38:17] expectation in our heart is rising up
[38:19] even now to know that you have something
[38:21] special for your people we love you lord
[38:24] we commit the preaching of the word to
[38:26] you lord in ourselves there's nothing we
[38:28] could do but if you would come lord
[38:30] break the bread of life as only you can
[38:32] we ask it in your most wonderful name
[38:34] the lord jesus christ
[38:37] amen and amen
[38:38] oh hallelujah you just feel his presence
[38:41] so mighty let's turn in our bibles we'll
[38:43] be reading out of psalms 118 i just want
[38:45] to continue on our thought
[38:47] uh this would be part three this is the
[38:49] lord's doing but as a subject
[38:52] i want to speak to you
[38:54] it's my turn
[38:58] we're reading out of psalms 118 verse 21
[39:01] through 23.
[39:10] amen i like a midweek service
[39:14] i think it's perfectly placed there
[39:16] right in the middle of the week
[39:18] sometimes it's a struggle sometimes it's
[39:20] a fight but you know
[39:22] it's a greater blessing
[39:25] if you ain't gotta fight for something
[39:27] you know the reward might not be so
[39:28] great but when you gotta fight for
[39:29] something
[39:30] you know uh we we i don't know about you
[39:33] but around my house
[39:35] when things just start going
[39:37] haywire
[39:38] and the kids might be screaming it seems
[39:40] like the atmosphere is getting a little
[39:42] heavy and it just seems like we're
[39:43] having a hard time getting there there's
[39:45] something on the inside goes get ready
[39:48] it's going to be a good one
[39:50] is there somebody that had to fight to
[39:51] get to the house of god
[39:53] was it a struggle mate maybe you didn't
[39:55] even know if you'd be able to make it
[39:56] but there was something inside of your
[39:57] drawer and you poisoned oh i'm going to
[39:59] make it to the house of god well then
[40:01] god has something for you so we're going
[40:02] to look past the veil we're going to
[40:04] look past man and we're going to see
[40:05] what god has to say amen just reading
[40:08] out of psalms 118 verse 21 it said i
[40:10] will praise thee for thou has heard me
[40:12] and are become my salvation
[40:19] the stone which the builders refuse has
[40:21] become the headstone of the corner this
[40:24] is the lord's doing
[40:26] and it is marvelous in our eyes you may
[40:28] have your seats
[40:29] and also if you will turn with me to
[40:31] hebrews chapter 11
[40:36] it's almost difficult to pick
[40:38] a spot to read in hebrews 11. you just
[40:40] want to read the whole thing
[40:43] but we're going to pick up uh in hebrews
[40:45] uh 11 chapter uh hebrews chapter 11
[40:48] verse 32.
[40:50] it's good to that brother yance with us
[40:52] amen maybe we'll get a chance to shake
[40:54] your hand afterwards
[40:58] it says
[41:00] is everybody there hebrews 11 verse 32
[41:04] through 40. it says and what shall i
[41:07] more say
[41:09] for the time would fail me
[41:11] to tell of gideon
[41:13] and of barrick and of samson and
[41:15] jephthah and of david also in samuel and
[41:18] of the prophets who through faith
[41:20] subdued kingdoms
[41:22] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[41:25] stopped the mouth of lions oh we we
[41:28] could stop right there and just preach
[41:29] for a little bit
[41:31] but by faith they obtained promises
[41:34] god has given you something that the
[41:36] world knows nothing about
[41:38] there's a sixth sense of faith
[41:41] that when you hear a promise laying in
[41:44] the word you have an ability to obtain
[41:48] that promise
[41:49] there there's a special gift a gift of
[41:51] revelation given to the believer that
[41:53] when you hear the word you hear the
[41:55] message there's something in you that
[41:57] can obtain that for yourself
[42:02] stop the mouth alliance quench the
[42:04] violence of fire
[42:06] escape the edge of the sword out of
[42:08] weakness
[42:09] were made strong
[42:11] waxed valiant in fight turn to flight
[42:13] the armies of the aliens women
[42:16] received their dead rays to life again
[42:20] others were tortured not accepting
[42:22] deliverance that they might obtain a
[42:24] better resurrection
[42:27] just listen to that
[42:29] women received their dead rage life and
[42:31] others were tortured
[42:33] not accepting deliverance
[42:35] that they might obtain a better
[42:38] resurrection
[42:39] you know many times uh you know
[42:42] we we feel like this life that we're
[42:44] living if it ever feels like it's
[42:46] becoming cumbersome to you and you feel
[42:48] like you just want to let off the
[42:49] pressure a little bit why why can't i
[42:51] just go out
[42:53] and uh mess around with the things of
[42:56] the world why do the preachers uh preach
[42:58] so hard against these things you realize
[43:01] that there there was there was brothers
[43:03] and sisters who have gone before us who
[43:05] were being tortured
[43:09] in ways we would be hard for us to even
[43:11] understand
[43:13] how our babies were ripped from their
[43:15] stomachs and they were boiled and tar
[43:18] was poured on them and their hair was
[43:21] set on fire
[43:22] and and that was placed before them but
[43:25] they esteemed something greater
[43:29] there was something in them and there
[43:30] was a resolve that said look uh uh
[43:33] there's something greater than my
[43:35] deliverance in the flesh
[43:37] there's such something greater than a
[43:39] liberty to live any kind of way i want
[43:41] to there's a greater resurrection
[43:45] and others had trials of cruel mockings
[43:48] and scourge and jay moreover of bonds
[43:50] and imprisonments they were stoned they
[43:53] were sawn asunder where tempted were
[43:55] slain with the sword
[43:57] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[44:00] goat skins being destitute afflicted and
[44:03] tormented
[44:04] of whom the world
[44:06] was not worthy
[44:07] they wandered in deserts and in
[44:09] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[44:12] earth and these all
[44:14] having obtained a good report through
[44:17] faith
[44:18] received not the promise
[44:22] god having something some better things
[44:24] for us
[44:25] that they without us
[44:28] should not be made perfect
[44:31] why would a what a wonderful
[44:33] representation
[44:34] of the saints
[44:36] that have gone uh before us through by
[44:38] faith they endured scourgings and and
[44:41] trials and mockings and they wandered
[44:43] the deserts and and and and sheepskin
[44:46] and clothing and and they refused to be
[44:48] delivered what a what a great uh
[44:51] exhortation paul is showing us in the
[44:54] scriptures and i just want to read this
[44:56] quote as we've been reading this as
[44:58] we've been on this subject the prophet
[45:00] of god would say in expectancy in 53
[45:02] said now no matter what the opposition
[45:04] looks like
[45:05] christ is the answer
[45:07] faith brings christ notice could you
[45:10] remember 80 years old white beard white
[45:12] hair and yet the old man went around
[45:15] telling people that he wasn't going to
[45:17] die until he's seen the lord's christ
[45:20] what a beautiful picture of faith
[45:23] faith knows no defeat
[45:27] faith is perfect faith brings things
[45:30] when there is no things to be brought
[45:33] faith creates
[45:35] faith takes doubt away
[45:37] takes negative and makes it positive
[45:42] or i just like that that's been speaking
[45:44] to my heart how faith takes the negative
[45:46] and makes it a positive we know that
[45:48] this scripture would open up in hebrews
[45:51] 11 verse one would say now faith is the
[45:53] substance of things hoped for it is the
[45:56] evidence of things not seen and paul
[45:59] would go on to say in galatians 3 6 he
[46:01] would say even as abraham believed god
[46:04] and it was accounted to him for
[46:05] righteousness
[46:07] now know ye therefore that they which
[46:09] are of faith the same are the children
[46:12] of abraham is there anybody here that
[46:14] are of faith that are the children of
[46:17] abraham look faith takes the negative
[46:20] and makes it a positive.
[46:23] i like that how abraham the father of
[46:25] our faith see see what what appeared to
[46:28] abraham as abraham was given the promise
[46:32] that you're going to have a son it
[46:34] seemed like with every week and with
[46:37] every month that passed by and then with
[46:39] every year that had gone by as five
[46:42] years turned into ten and
[46:45] ten turned into twenty it would seem
[46:47] that would be a negative
[46:51] but faith will take the negative
[46:54] and turn it into a positive now i don't
[46:57] know about you but i've been dealing
[46:58] with some negative things and if you're
[47:00] living in lady you'll see you then
[47:02] there's going to be negativity all
[47:03] around you there's going to be
[47:05] negativity in your work there's going to
[47:06] be negativity in your job there's going
[47:08] to be negativity when you go to the
[47:10] grocery store there's negativity at the
[47:12] gas pump
[47:15] there's negativity in the news there's
[47:17] negativity in the media everywhere you
[47:19] go there's negativity everywhere but the
[47:22] believer has an advantage that the world
[47:25] knows nothing about because there is a
[47:27] faith inside of the believer that knows
[47:30] with all of these things going out there
[47:32] i can take all of the negative and know
[47:35] that there is a positive that is coming
[47:38] forth in my life
[47:41] abraham could look at sarah and say
[47:43] sarah
[47:44] do you feel any different do you feel
[47:46] any better no i feel just the same
[47:48] praise god
[47:52] and five years would go by abra uh sarah
[47:55] do you feel any different no i don't
[47:57] feel praise god it's just five years
[48:00] more a miracle
[48:02] see faith took what seemed to be a
[48:04] negative faith took what looked like
[48:06] defeat faith looked like what the
[48:08] obstacle was
[48:09] faith took that and said that's just a
[48:12] greater miracle
[48:14] where's faith resting place
[48:17] it's in the word of god so you're not
[48:19] limited to time
[48:20] oh praise god we're not limited at the
[48:22] time
[48:23] praise god we're not limited to our
[48:25] thinking praise god we're not limited to
[48:28] our own ideas
[48:29] faith is not limited
[48:32] to the five senses faith isn't limited
[48:35] to what your mind can come up with
[48:36] faith's resting place is in the word of
[48:39] god
[48:40] if i can get a little bit more on the
[48:42] monitor just a little bit
[48:46] the prophet would say this
[48:48] and perseverant
[48:50] he'd say glory to god we're going to
[48:52] have a baby anyhow get the booties ready
[48:55] all the bird eye and the pens and
[48:57] everything get ready we're going to have
[48:59] it
[49:00] well how do you know we're going to have
[49:02] it god said so
[49:04] the second month passed how you feeling
[49:06] sarah no different glory to god it's
[49:08] another month greater miracle oh my
[49:11] hallelujah your past how you feeling
[49:14] dear no different glory it's a year
[49:16] greater
[49:18] and 25 years past how you feel and sarah
[49:21] old and feeble how you feeling no
[49:24] different dear glory to god
[49:27] it's 25 years more a miracle
[49:31] now we're talking about faith
[49:33] faith is the evidence
[49:35] faith is a substance that the believer
[49:38] possesses where you can look the
[49:40] symptoms right in the face and say god
[49:43] said so
[49:44] then doctor if you're telling me that's
[49:46] how bad the symptoms are that means
[49:48] that's how much greater the miracle is
[49:50] going to be if you're telling me my
[49:52] womb's dried up and there's no way i can
[49:54] have a baby if you're telling me my
[49:56] husband's still i don't care what the
[49:58] doctor said i've received a divine
[50:00] promise from god that i'm going to have
[50:02] a baby so every symptom the devil pours
[50:05] on you every time the devil tries to
[50:07] throw that in your face and try to tell
[50:09] you you went through the prayer line you
[50:11] got prayed for you believed god you
[50:13] spoke the word you did this you did that
[50:15] that was eight years ago that was ten
[50:18] years ago that was fifteen years ago i
[50:20] don't care that just means it's 15 years
[50:23] more a greater miracle don't tell me i
[50:25] don't know what i'm talking about we
[50:27] have a sister sitting right amongst us
[50:29] who i believe had her first child at the
[50:30] age of 52. our god knows what he's doing
[50:34] he's always right on time
[50:38] face final resting place is the word of
[50:40] god
[50:43] it's just a greater miracle
[50:46] glory to god somebody ought to just
[50:47] start singing and shouting
[50:49] you've been really going through it for
[50:51] a little while and you didn't realize
[50:53] that you're just getting ready for a
[50:54] greater miracle
[50:56] oh my you thought you were being
[50:58] tortured you thought you were being beat
[51:00] down you just thought you you you were
[51:02] never gonna get the victory but really
[51:05] what's happening is god is just going to
[51:07] bring forth a greater miracle in your
[51:09] life
[51:12] well let's just hear what the prophet
[51:13] had to say about it
[51:16] and we say we're abraham's seed uh huh
[51:19] we got the holy ghost well i was prayed
[51:21] for last night but i sure didn't get
[51:23] healed
[51:24] you're a poor excuse for abraham's seed
[51:27] abraham called those things which were
[51:30] not as though they were amen hallelujah
[51:32] for he believed that what god had
[51:34] promised god was big enough to keep his
[51:37] word
[51:40] well i want to read that again
[51:44] he said you're a poor excuse
[51:47] for abraham's seed
[51:49] abraham called those things which were
[51:51] not as though they were hallelujah for
[51:54] he believed that what god had promised
[51:57] god was big enough to keep his word
[52:01] now i just want to say we got to get our
[52:03] eyes off of the flesh
[52:04] we need to get our eyes off the things
[52:06] of the world and start to think about is
[52:08] god big enough to keep his word
[52:12] my god is big enough to keep his word if
[52:15] he made the promise
[52:17] my god is big enough i don't care the
[52:20] symptoms i don't care the calamity i
[52:22] don't care the trial i don't care the
[52:24] doctor's report i don't care how bad bad
[52:26] it looks i know that my god is big
[52:29] enough he will back up his word and my
[52:33] duty and my responsibility is to stand
[52:36] fast upon that word and say god said so
[52:42] look that old devil right in the face
[52:47] my god's big enough
[52:49] to back up his word the doctor tries to
[52:51] tell you you're going to die the doctor
[52:53] tries to tell you this is the way it's
[52:55] going to be you can stare right back at
[52:56] that doctor
[53:00] tell them no that's not the way it's
[53:02] going to be
[53:04] and even if it was that way
[53:07] my god's still faithful
[53:09] well it reminds me of that sister uh
[53:12] that that that her colleagues came
[53:14] around
[53:16] and she started to testify to him and
[53:18] say look
[53:19] she
[53:20] they said oh there's nothing to that
[53:21] william branham
[53:23] and she said now wait a second
[53:25] i might be dying on my deathbed
[53:28] but i've been around too long
[53:30] let me just tell you a little bit i've
[53:32] seen it time and time again and it's
[53:34] never failed if i could just get him to
[53:37] come back and pray for me
[53:39] oh there's nothing to it there's nothing
[53:41] to that message there's nothing to that
[53:43] prophet you haven't heard of all the
[53:45] false reports and she started to stick
[53:47] up and she started to testify for the
[53:50] for the message of the hour
[53:53] the prophet of god says it's about three
[53:55] o'clock in the morning
[53:56] i was getting a glass of water or
[53:58] something and the angel came through the
[54:00] door and said you go tell i don't know
[54:02] if it's sister webber uh you go tell
[54:04] sister that i heard what she said
[54:08] and thus saith the lord she is healed
[54:10] look god is listening to your confession
[54:14] confession is made unto salvation you
[54:17] want to put the words look what did the
[54:18] word come to do it came to restore our
[54:20] heart and the scripture says the word is
[54:23] naive even in thy mouth and in that
[54:25] heart we've got to take that word that
[54:27] has been restored in our heart and start
[54:29] speaking the word
[54:32] oh glory to god speak the word church
[54:35] what does the word say about it
[54:38] my god's big enough to keep his word my
[54:40] god's big enough to keep his promise and
[54:42] even if he's not just like the hebrew
[54:45] children even if he doesn't
[54:46] deliver us o king
[54:48] our god is faithful and we're not going
[54:51] to bow to your image i'm not going to

[55:13] lord in my heart

[55:18] into that place i'm sorry that's okay
[55:20] i'm not condemning you i'm just saying
[55:21] that's the way god made me
[55:23] look as a young christian uh uh they
[55:26] they brought me up to the president of
[55:28] uh parking cars in dallas and you know
[55:30] they i told him look i don't work on

[55:38] working late i told them look i don't
[55:40] work past 11 59 on saturday
[55:43] that might have been a little bit more
[55:49] i might have been using the word to my
[55:50] advantage there
[55:53] but i just something to me i don't work
[55:54] on sunday
[55:57] so i remember i worked there for about a
[55:59] year or so and they came and got me to
[56:01] say oh by the way

[56:08] know but we've been so good to you
[56:09] matthew we've never even made you work
[56:11] one sunday you've been here oh you've
[56:13] been with us and everything but we're

[57:17] because i'm not working on sunday and in
[57:19] that moment
[57:20] they realized
[57:21] i could tell that that president he
[57:23] wasn't expecting that answer and he had
[57:25] to be quick on his feet because he
[57:26] realized that that i wasn't subject to
[57:29] his authority oh hallelujah i wasn't
[57:32] subject
[57:33] to my boss's authority because there was
[57:36] a greater authority over the authority
[57:40] of the world i have the authority of the
[57:42] word i can say you could fire me you can
[57:45] do whatever you want but the authority
[57:47] of the word says i don't work on sunday
[57:50] that's where my faith was resting in the
[57:52] word of god and that's not condemnation
[57:54] to you if you have to work on sunday
[57:56] that's an encouragement to tell you if
[57:58] you don't want to work on sunday anymore
[58:01] you don't have to
[58:03] that's all
[58:04] hallelujah by faith
[58:07] they obtained promises
[58:10] you have not because you ask not
[58:15] try god
[58:17] put them first
[58:20] watch what happens
[58:23] oh we're talking about we think we're
[58:25] tortured
[58:28] imagine
[58:30] okay matthew
[58:32] if you don't work on sunday tomorrow
[58:35] we're going to tie you to a post
[58:39] and burn you
[58:42] ain't no different church
[58:45] we've gotten so soft well here i go in
[58:47] my soapbox
[58:48] we've gotten so soft
[58:51] so vindicated
[58:53] so message fied
[58:55] we can live any kind of way and dabble
[58:58] in any kind of thing and just listen to
[59:00] the message and live any kind of way we
[59:02] want to live and we're going in a
[59:04] rapture bless god glory to god we're all
[59:07] saved sanctified and go
[59:10] are are you sanctified
[59:14] for how many minutes out of the day
[59:18] on sunday wednesday night
[59:21] sanctified
[59:22] half the time
[59:26] we need the holy ghost church
[59:29] we need the holy ghost we're not facing
[59:32] what those those believers faced
[59:35] look that's exactly what was being
[59:37] thrown in their face you renounce the
[59:38] word
[59:41] now tell me what part of the word is
[59:43] greater than
[59:44] another show me one place in the written
[59:47] word that's greater
[59:51] you can you can't add to it
[59:53] and you can't take away from it
[59:56] and then we think we're gonna get by
[59:59] what was the very fall in the very
[1:00:02] beginning
[1:00:03] one word
[1:00:05] and what has god done in the end time
[1:00:07] he's restored
[1:00:09] all the word
[1:00:11] and called a bride that would believe
[1:00:14] all that word
[1:00:16] so then if you see a portion of the word
[1:00:19] that you're not living faithful to that
[1:00:22] is not a condemnation that is god wooing
[1:00:25] to you and telling you don't worry i've
[1:00:28] placed something inside of you that can
[1:00:30] obtain the promise of the word and bring
[1:00:34] it into manifestation i'm just wanting
[1:00:36] you to step out by faith oh lord if that
[1:00:40] be you bid me come
[1:00:42] come on peter just start walking come on
[1:00:45] bride if you see it in the word it's for
[1:00:47] you
[1:00:48] what do you got need of what do you want
[1:00:50] tonight if you see it there come on
[1:00:54] what is it you've been praying for what
[1:00:56] is it you've been believing for what is
[1:00:58] it you've been asking for the holy
[1:00:59] spirit is here has been you come on
[1:01:02] step out of the boat some of us have
[1:01:04] just gotten too comfortable in our
[1:01:06] little boat
[1:01:07] we're just going along just fine and we
[1:01:09] don't want to step out by faith but god
[1:01:12] is calling to an elect people and say
[1:01:14] come on
[1:01:18] it's time to step out by faith it's time
[1:01:20] to speak the word it's time to see these
[1:01:23] promises and these prophecies that have
[1:01:26] been spoken by malachi 4 taking on flesh
[1:01:30] oh that makes me excited
[1:01:33] look with men
[1:01:34] it's impossible
[1:01:37] but with god
[1:01:40] for with god all things
[1:01:43] are possible we're not appealing to your
[1:01:45] flesh we're not
[1:01:47] asking you to produce something in your
[1:01:49] mind or in your intellectual abilities
[1:01:53] that's not what we're after
[1:01:58] no
[1:01:59] you'll fall short every time
[1:02:02] how many have you fallen flat on your
[1:02:04] face
[1:02:05] and you've tried over and over again and
[1:02:07] maybe you have a descending set of be
[1:02:09] setting sin in your life
[1:02:14] it's time to get serious
[1:02:16] say you know what i cleaned up for six
[1:02:18] months a year i find myself falling back
[1:02:21] to the same trap now
[1:02:23] satan wants to continue condemn you for
[1:02:25] that
[1:02:27] but what's the purpose of testing
[1:02:30] to see if you can pass the test
[1:02:35] has anybody ever failed a test in school
[1:02:40] why did you fail the test
[1:02:42] she didn't know what you're talking
[1:02:43] about
[1:02:45] so what do you have to do
[1:02:47] you got to take the test over again
[1:02:50] so that's the purpose of it
[1:02:53] we know who we are in the word
[1:02:56] but yet there but god is wanting
[1:02:59] that knowledge
[1:03:00] to become a revelation it has to become
[1:03:03] more than just an intellectual
[1:03:05] conception it has to become more than
[1:03:07] you know you see it laying in the word
[1:03:09] but you but you but you but you know
[1:03:11] that you need something greater to pull
[1:03:14] you into that manifestation that's not
[1:03:16] so you can just sit back here and beat a
[1:03:18] feed and say i'll never get there but
[1:03:20] it's god showing you that look i have
[1:03:23] more for you and so when you come up
[1:03:25] against the test and you come up against
[1:03:27] the trial and you fail again then you
[1:03:30] have a higher appeal say oh god
[1:03:33] you're the high priest that's touched by
[1:03:35] the feeling of my affirmative lord
[1:03:36] forgive me
[1:03:38] i've failed you yet again but i keep
[1:03:40] failing every time i come to this test
[1:03:43] lord and you seek god's face for the
[1:03:46] answer in your life
[1:03:48] and many times you know what you come to
[1:03:50] find out
[1:03:52] the reason you keep following to that
[1:03:54] besetting sin is because it's another
[1:03:56] area of your life satan likes to set up
[1:03:59] strongholds
[1:04:01] satan likes to be able to attack you in
[1:04:03] such a way
[1:04:05] where he can take a portion of your life
[1:04:07] and make you compromise maybe not in
[1:04:10] such a bad way maybe not in such an evil
[1:04:12] way might be in your prayer life it
[1:04:14] might be with reading your bible he
[1:04:15] might get you to compromise in such a
[1:04:17] way where you've kind of slacked over
[1:04:19] here and then when you run out on the
[1:04:21] battlefield you keep coming up against
[1:04:23] this and you keep falling and you keep
[1:04:25] wondering why you're falling and maybe
[1:04:27] what you got to come back to in the real
[1:04:29] life is you got to come back to your
[1:04:30] abc's
[1:04:32] and realize that you've forsaken some of
[1:04:34] the basic principles of a christian life
[1:04:37] how you got to read your bible and
[1:04:38] there's one thing you can never do too
[1:04:40] much is pray
[1:04:43] i say oh god help me to pray
[1:04:46] that's that's been in my heart lord i
[1:04:48] want a better prayer life oh god
[1:04:51] seems that lady will see it with
[1:04:53] everything pressing all around and the
[1:04:55] buzzing of the world and then the city
[1:04:58] around it just sometimes seems so hard
[1:05:01] to get away and break away into his
[1:05:02] presence
[1:05:04] when's the last time
[1:05:08] you got along with god
[1:05:12] and the world drifted away
[1:05:16] and the presence of god started to move
[1:05:18] in
[1:05:21] you started to feel his presence
[1:05:25] you started to feel
[1:05:26] the atmosphere change
[1:05:29] you started to feel
[1:05:31] a channel open up
[1:05:33] you started to feel
[1:05:35] something that you hadn't felt in a
[1:05:36] while
[1:05:38] and it just seemed like the heaviness
[1:05:41] of life just started to lift
[1:05:44] and the cares
[1:05:46] and the burdens
[1:05:48] started to fall away and all of a sudden
[1:05:49] you're in an atmosphere
[1:05:51] you're in a presence
[1:05:53] and you start weeping
[1:05:55] and you feel his arms wrapped around you
[1:05:57] and something
[1:05:59] you can't even explain is taking place
[1:06:01] oh
[1:06:03] if you could get to that place
[1:06:07] i invite you
[1:06:09] you come to a place
[1:06:12] where you meet god on those sacred sands
[1:06:16] not just once
[1:06:19] i want to say
[1:06:22] coming into the presence of god
[1:06:25] and and having a sacred sands experience
[1:06:29] is so
[1:06:30] powerful it'll change your life forever
[1:06:35] you will you will never be the same
[1:06:39] and because of that
[1:06:41] you can go a long time
[1:06:46] but but i want to caution you
[1:06:50] why would you do that
[1:06:53] oh when you when you come to know the
[1:06:54] lord and your youth and god does such a
[1:06:57] wonderful work we're not even preaching
[1:06:59] anything we would come to preach but
[1:07:01] somebody's pulling something
[1:07:03] when you when you come to when you come
[1:07:05] to god
[1:07:07] and you have that that new birth
[1:07:09] experience and the burden of sin is
[1:07:11] lifted and you're just soaring in the
[1:07:13] heavenlies
[1:07:15] oh and you're just ready to take on the
[1:07:16] world and you're testifying and you're
[1:07:19] doing the things that you know to do
[1:07:23] it's often many times
[1:07:26] we forget what brought us into that
[1:07:29] place
[1:07:30] we got desperate
[1:07:32] we got before god we started to to cry
[1:07:35] out to god's hell god i need your help
[1:07:37] oh god i need you to come on the scene
[1:07:40] why would we sell ourselves short
[1:07:43] that while we're on the mountaintop
[1:07:47] that's the time
[1:07:50] praise them
[1:07:51] worship them
[1:07:53] give them glory
[1:07:55] it it's in those moments many times when
[1:07:58] you feel free in your spirit
[1:08:00] and and you're doing just fine and
[1:08:01] nothing's wrong we just keep going
[1:08:03] through life and then all of a sudden we
[1:08:05] hit the ditch and we wonder why
[1:08:07] we ought to take advantage of those
[1:08:08] moments we ought to take advantage of
[1:08:10] the time that that we're feeling good
[1:08:12] that things are going we feel we're on
[1:08:13] the mountaintop why would we allow
[1:08:15] ourselves to go one year or six months
[1:08:18] or two weeks from from seeking his face
[1:08:20] and coming into his presence
[1:08:23] oh with god all things are possible
[1:08:26] no matter how dark it gets we we
[1:08:28] ministered
[1:08:30] about uh uh
[1:08:32] you know this is the lord's doing and
[1:08:33] it's marvelous in our eyes how how many
[1:08:36] times your faith takes the negative and
[1:08:37] makes it a positive you know we might
[1:08:39] understand not understand what the lord
[1:08:41] is doing it might it might look like a
[1:08:43] negative we might not understand what
[1:08:45] the trial means but by faith we can
[1:08:47] stand like job and say oh the lord
[1:08:49] giveth and the lord taketh away blessed
[1:08:51] be the name of the lord the lord can
[1:08:53] take whatever trial it is and give god
[1:08:55] glory and say this is the lord's doing
[1:08:58] and it's marvelous in our eyes and and
[1:09:00] we moved a little bit on it we we spoke
[1:09:02] about uh wounded but still fighting
[1:09:05] and how no matter how impossible
[1:09:08] things look or whatever the trial that
[1:09:09] you're going through we know that god is
[1:09:11] in control
[1:09:13] that we can stand there and say this is
[1:09:14] the lord's doing
[1:09:17] look that doesn't take away the pain
[1:09:20] that doesn't take away the hurt that
[1:09:21] doesn't take away the suffering
[1:09:24] but it's in that trial it's in that
[1:09:26] moment what we're speaking about is
[1:09:27] being wounded
[1:09:30] but still fighting
[1:09:31] and as david would say there in psalms
[1:09:33] 42 1 he said as the heart pantheth after
[1:09:35] the water books so pantheth my soul
[1:09:37] after thee o god
[1:09:40] remember what he said no matter what the
[1:09:42] opposition is
[1:09:44] christ is the answer if that deer didn't
[1:09:46] get to water it would die
[1:09:49] and that's the same thing for the
[1:09:50] believer
[1:09:51] if you don't get to the water if you
[1:09:54] don't get to christ you're going to die
[1:09:56] especially when you've been wounded or
[1:09:58] you've been hurt
[1:10:00] we were dealing with how easy it is for
[1:10:01] you to want to lay down your sword how
[1:10:03] easy it is for you to want to give up
[1:10:05] how easy it is for you to want to go to
[1:10:07] the entertainment of the world or
[1:10:09] sometime after a hard day at work you
[1:10:11] get home and you just you just want to
[1:10:14] unwind
[1:10:18] and it's easy for us to want to unwind
[1:10:21] in our mind with the things of the world
[1:10:25] but we should unwind in our heart with
[1:10:28] the things of god
[1:10:31] hey we're all guilty of it
[1:10:35] we're wounded
[1:10:37] and when you're wounded you're thirsty
[1:10:39] you've got to get to water and the
[1:10:40] devil's always there to offer a
[1:10:41] substitute well just a little this just
[1:10:44] take your mind off of this don't even
[1:10:45] worry about it they said this they say
[1:10:47] you heard what happened at church you
[1:10:49] heard what the preacher said they were
[1:10:50] talking about you why don't you just
[1:10:52] watch this or get on this little go over
[1:10:54] to your friend's house just just don't
[1:10:56] even worry about just take your mind off
[1:10:58] of it and you'll find yourself in
[1:11:00] greater condemnation because you heeded
[1:11:02] the word of the devil but it's those
[1:11:04] times that you need a drink
[1:11:07] we say oh god i need a drink from the
[1:11:09] fountain oh god i need to unwind all my
[1:11:12] spirits and say the lord let me come to
[1:11:14] my bible let me come to my prayer closet
[1:11:16] let me put on a tape oh god let me seek
[1:11:19] your face oh as the deer el pantus after
[1:11:22] the water book sow my soul pantheth
[1:11:24] after thee oh god
[1:11:28] first peter 4 12 would read like this
[1:11:35] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:11:37] the fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:11:39] though some strange thing happened
[1:11:42] unto you but rejoice in so much as ye
[1:11:45] are partakers of christ's suffering that
[1:11:47] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[1:11:50] be glad
[1:11:51] also with exceeding joy
[1:11:54] we heard about singing a new song
[1:11:58] sunday night
[1:12:00] that was the only service i was here for
[1:12:01] flew in didn't get the morning but i
[1:12:03] went back and listened to a good portion
[1:12:04] of it wonderful word
[1:12:06] i want to say faith gives you a new song
[1:12:10] just like job can say look the lord
[1:12:12] in that calamity in that trial
[1:12:15] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:12:18] blessed be the name of the lord there
[1:12:20] was an anchor
[1:12:21] just like brother branham when the black
[1:12:23] sheep came down
[1:12:24] and he was ready to give up look all the
[1:12:26] things the devil are saying are true uh
[1:12:28] i i stood on the field i've preached and
[1:12:30] now i've lost my wife i lost my baby i
[1:12:32] lost my brother all these things that
[1:12:33] the devil is telling me and he's trying
[1:12:35] to tell me that god don't love me he
[1:12:36] come too late to tell me he wasn't real
[1:12:37] but he's telling me you don't love me
[1:12:38] because and here in the moment that i
[1:12:40] need him more than i've ever needed in
[1:12:42] my life here's a black sheep that that's
[1:12:44] dropped down and if that's the way he's
[1:12:46] going to be that i'll just and something
[1:12:49] caught what was it look faith is not
[1:12:52] something that you muster up
[1:12:55] faith is an attribute of god faith is a
[1:12:58] gift lest any man can boast faith is
[1:13:01] that anchor that in that moment and in
[1:13:03] that trial that it anchored to the word
[1:13:06] and said oh the lord giveth and the lord
[1:13:08] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[1:13:10] lord look faith gives you a new song
[1:13:13] that in the trial and in the suffering
[1:13:15] you can rejoice knowing that in that
[1:13:18] much that you are partakers of christ's
[1:13:20] suffering
[1:13:23] i was thinking along those lines about
[1:13:25] the the spies at cades barnea
[1:13:28] they went over and they said they we be
[1:13:30] as grasshoppers
[1:13:32] because they were lacking
[1:13:35] what was needed to possess the promised
[1:13:37] land
[1:13:38] they were lacking faith in what the
[1:13:41] prophet had said they were lacking faith
[1:13:44] and thus saith the lord god give them
[1:13:46] the land
[1:13:47] therefore they were able to take it but
[1:13:49] since they lacked faith in the word they
[1:13:52] weren't able to take it but joshua and
[1:13:54] caleb had a different song
[1:13:57] while everybody else what
[1:13:59] was was complaining and and you know you
[1:14:02] brought us out here to die we can't even
[1:14:04] go in there we'd be as grasshoppers to
[1:14:06] them there's giants in the land and what
[1:14:08] did caleb have to stand there and do and
[1:14:10] steal the people say what are you
[1:14:12] talking about i'm singing a different
[1:14:14] song i'm singing a different tune
[1:14:16] because there's something inside of me
[1:14:19] that's not looking at the flesh realm
[1:14:21] that's like looking at the circumstances
[1:14:23] you might see giants over there and
[1:14:25] walled cities and chariots of iron but i
[1:14:28] am looking at thus saith the lord i'm
[1:14:31] looking at a divine promise of god that
[1:14:33] said ye shall take the land now what
[1:14:36] about your healing what about your
[1:14:38] daughter what about your son what about
[1:14:40] your trial what about your healing what
[1:14:42] about what about it
[1:14:45] come on somebody what about it
[1:14:48] what are you looking at faith is there
[1:14:50] to declare
[1:14:52] faith calls those things which are not
[1:14:55] as though they are i don't care how many
[1:14:57] giants are in the land i don't care how
[1:14:59] bad the symptoms are i'm not going to
[1:15:02] sing that song i'm singing another song
[1:15:05] that god is faithful who made the
[1:15:08] promise oh
[1:15:10] glory to god thank god for faith
[1:15:14] hallelujah
[1:15:16] oh my that's it
[1:15:18] we be as grasshoppers
[1:15:21] brother branham mentions
[1:15:23] you know it's not the size
[1:15:25] he went to that stadium and that he read
[1:15:27] that little uh saying
[1:15:30] on the stadium wall said it's not the
[1:15:31] size
[1:15:32] of the dog in the fight
[1:15:35] it's the size of the fight in the dog
[1:15:40] i don't know how well that translates
[1:15:46] israel
[1:15:48] might not have been able in number
[1:15:50] or in strength or in weapons
[1:15:54] to match up against the inhabitants
[1:15:57] of canaan
[1:16:00] you in your abilities and in your mind
[1:16:03] and in your in what you can perceive you
[1:16:05] might not be able to match up against
[1:16:08] the devil but i'm so thankful it's not
[1:16:11] the size
[1:16:12] of the dog in the fight it's the size of
[1:16:15] the fight in the dog
[1:16:17] and you realize that fight that is on
[1:16:19] the inside of you is a very gene seed of
[1:16:22] god
[1:16:23] that's why you can't quit
[1:16:26] that's why you can't back up that's why
[1:16:28] you can't lay down there is a gene seed
[1:16:31] of god that is inside of you oh if you
[1:16:33] only knew how big that fight was
[1:16:36] that that that faith will lay hold of
[1:16:38] god's promise it'll never let it go even
[1:16:41] when your mind fails you
[1:16:43] even when all of your reason and all the
[1:16:44] doubt and everything just seems to to
[1:16:47] give in there is something greater than
[1:16:49] all of that that will never let hold of
[1:16:51] that promise
[1:16:54] well what is the name of the brother
[1:16:55] cartwright i believe he was going to
[1:16:57] hold himself a revival god told him to
[1:16:59] go holy revival
[1:17:03] as you know he was over there washing
[1:17:04] the windows and everything just a little
[1:17:06] bitty guy and the bully of the town say
[1:17:08] what's this guy doing what's that
[1:17:09] preacher over there doing he's going to
[1:17:11] hold a revival wait come on down i think
[1:17:13] peter cartwright told him hey you're not
[1:17:15] going to hold no revival in my town
[1:17:18] he come down say what are you doing well
[1:17:20] i'm washing windows
[1:17:22] what for
[1:17:24] well i'm going to hold me a revival no
[1:17:25] you ain't
[1:17:28] not unless you go through me first
[1:17:31] well
[1:17:33] if that's what i got to do next
[1:17:36] so what did he do
[1:17:38] he turned around he grabbed him by the
[1:17:41] collar he started to beat the car out of
[1:17:43] him he said if i must fight if i must
[1:17:44] reign and crease my courage lord and he
[1:17:46] with the beating the tar out of them i
[1:17:48] think that's what some of us christians
[1:17:50] need to do to the devil the devil's just
[1:17:52] been a big old bully it's just been a
[1:17:54] big old bluff and you need to take the
[1:17:56] word of god and start pounding that
[1:17:58] devil back
[1:17:59] you've robbed me of my joy you've robbed
[1:18:01] me of my peace you've robbed me of my
[1:18:03] family you've robbed me of my victory
[1:18:09] well i don't know about you but i don't
[1:18:11] like being bullied
[1:18:13] i don't like being pushed around
[1:18:17] but you know the devil gots his targets
[1:18:19] on you
[1:18:20] and if you give him an inch
[1:18:22] he'll take it and anymore he'll take
[1:18:25] whatever you give him
[1:18:26] and peter cartwright could have just
[1:18:28] packed his bags and said oh i just
[1:18:30] thought it was the will of the lord but
[1:18:33] maybe he meant another town
[1:18:35] maybe he he may i'd be healed at the
[1:18:38] change of my body
[1:18:40] maybe he i'll have all of my family in
[1:18:42] heaven don't you back up off of god's uh
[1:18:45] a promise
[1:18:46] you know god don't let him bully you
[1:18:48] like that you say if that's what i got
[1:18:50] to go through next then come here old
[1:18:52] devil i'm to pound you with the word of
[1:18:54] god i'm going to pound you with thus
[1:18:55] saith the lord i'm going to pound you
[1:18:57] with these signs shall follow them back
[1:18:58] believe they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:19:00] they shall recover they shall cast out
[1:19:02] devils in my name
[1:19:04] you're going to beat that old devil with
[1:19:06] the word of god
[1:19:08] he's just a bluff
[1:19:11] the prophet of god says sometimes god
[1:19:12] lets things get so dark
[1:19:15] that you can't see up around or anywhere
[1:19:17] else and he comes and makes a way
[1:19:19] through it for you
[1:19:21] that you might say look at this this is
[1:19:23] beautiful
[1:19:26] sometimes god lets things get so dark
[1:19:31] that you can't see up
[1:19:33] around
[1:19:35] or anywhere else
[1:19:37] and then he comes
[1:19:39] and makes a way through it for you
[1:19:43] that you might say
[1:19:45] this day
[1:19:47] this scripture
[1:19:49] is being fulfilled
[1:19:51] that he promised to do
[1:19:55] now we're just coming to my inspiration
[1:19:56] so
[1:20:00] i was just
[1:20:02] brother ed biskull just recently
[1:20:07] uh had their 50th anniversary meetings
[1:20:10] and i was listening to brother ed uh
[1:20:12] give his testimony about when he had
[1:20:14] called
[1:20:15] brother ron
[1:20:16] spencer maybe would just be another 40
[1:20:19] minutes if that'll be okay
[1:20:24] an hour to
[1:20:27] it's your fault
[1:20:30] but i was listening to
[1:20:34] him give this testimony and i i just
[1:20:36] this really struck my heart because as
[1:20:39] as as he was testifying he said he
[1:20:41] called brother ron spencer and was
[1:20:43] asking him for prayer because brother i
[1:20:45] believe brother ed at the time was going
[1:20:46] through some heart procedures
[1:20:49] and he said he said he made this
[1:20:50] statement
[1:20:52] he said wow he's speaking of brother ron
[1:20:54] spencer was praying for brother biscuit
[1:20:55] he called him for prayer called brother
[1:20:57] ron spencer for prayer he said while he
[1:20:59] was praying i thought
[1:21:01] i'm gonna hang on to these words because
[1:21:05] it's my turn
[1:21:07] the woman at the well
[1:21:10] it was her turn
[1:21:12] but now this is my turn
[1:21:19] now something in my heart anchored in
[1:21:21] that
[1:21:22] because here brother you know you could
[1:21:24] just think of of you know many times the
[1:21:27] pastor he's he's standing in the gap and
[1:21:29] and and many times he's standing between
[1:21:32] the people you know and he's he's
[1:21:34] preaching and and he's he's counseling
[1:21:36] and he he's doing many things and many
[1:21:38] times
[1:21:39] the burden of the word upon the man is
[1:21:42] so demanding and and many times giving
[1:21:44] of himself and we know that's for all of
[1:21:46] us that doesn't mean anything about that
[1:21:48] you know the the we know eternal life is
[1:21:50] living for others that's we're all
[1:21:52] living for others and but in this moment
[1:21:55] he he had a need and he said now this is
[1:21:57] my turn
[1:21:59] and i wanted to say that's it that needs
[1:22:01] to be the attitude this is my turn this
[1:22:04] is my opportunity
[1:22:05] look the woman at the well
[1:22:08] she had her turn
[1:22:10] but now it's my turn i don't want you to
[1:22:13] say that god god has something special
[1:22:15] for you uh god is doing something for
[1:22:17] you and the devil is trying to keep you
[1:22:20] from what god is doing for you your joy
[1:22:23] is your your peace is yours
[1:22:26] healing is yours revelation is yours
[1:22:29] this message is yours
[1:22:31] the devil wants to take this message
[1:22:34] from you try to tell you that it was
[1:22:36] just another prophet try to try to tell
[1:22:39] you that there's mistakes in it no when
[1:22:41] you get the revelation of who it was
[1:22:44] you could see past the veil and you can
[1:22:47] see it was none other than our lord
[1:22:49] standing there
[1:22:50] it was malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. it was
[1:22:54] the revelation of the son of man it was
[1:22:56] the son of man ministry
[1:22:59] what did they see when moses came
[1:23:04] they saw a man
[1:23:07] but what did the scripture say
[1:23:09] i have come down
[1:23:13] and he said i have come down what was it
[1:23:16] it was god
[1:23:17] coming down and going in the form of a
[1:23:20] man
[1:23:21] so when you hear that voice
[1:23:24] i am just a mute
[1:23:26] like the microphone
[1:23:29] this microphone oh glory to god this
[1:23:32] microphone doesn't have a voice
[1:23:36] but when
[1:23:38] he comes in and steps behind it
[1:23:43] then it's god speaking
[1:23:46] now look we're mature enough that we
[1:23:48] don't fall into the the the the ignorant
[1:23:51] traps of wondering well you know well
[1:23:54] you know what was brother branham you
[1:23:56] know people people
[1:23:58] seem to be incapable
[1:24:01] recognizing brother branham was our
[1:24:03] brother subject to mistakes and like
[1:24:06] passions
[1:24:10] but i love how transparent and the way
[1:24:13] god does things
[1:24:14] because it shows us that the way he
[1:24:17] dealt with the prophet and the way he
[1:24:20] brought him into maturity that the way
[1:24:22] he'd be standing in the house and he'd
[1:24:23] be so uh weighed down by a tax case that
[1:24:27] when they would call that he said well
[1:24:29] just tell him i'm not here and he'd run
[1:24:30] out
[1:24:32] you're talking about a son of god coming
[1:24:34] into maturity coming into position
[1:24:37] taking ownership of his actions
[1:24:39] to know that he was going down to pray
[1:24:41] for some baby or pray from some sick
[1:24:43] case and he said you know what i'll be
[1:24:45] back
[1:24:46] i have to go make something right now
[1:24:49] god don't have to make anything right
[1:24:56] but the man who made the mistake
[1:25:00] had to go back and what's that showing
[1:25:02] us that's just showing us the an example
[1:25:06] we've received a message we've received
[1:25:08] the word we know we can't fall we know
[1:25:10] we're predestinated not to fall because
[1:25:12] there's a faith seed that's keeping us
[1:25:14] that won't let go of the word but god is
[1:25:16] bringing that word into a maturation
[1:25:19] into a perfection in our life that when
[1:25:21] we speak it's god speaking and so when
[1:25:24] we get out of line of the word those i
[1:25:26] love i rebuke and chasten so the prophet
[1:25:28] realized look in this condition i need
[1:25:31] to go back and make that right so that
[1:25:33] when i speak
[1:25:37] my words as good as his word
[1:25:40] and that's the maturity that god is
[1:25:42] wanting to bring us to that we can be so
[1:25:45] surrendered to the power of god so
[1:25:48] surrendered to our ideas and what the
[1:25:50] world wants to say about it that we can
[1:25:52] come so surrender to this message that
[1:25:54] the god of the message
[1:25:58] the same one that would speak through
[1:26:01] the prophet
[1:26:05] could come and take your vessel
[1:26:08] that's what god wants to do
[1:26:11] doesn't the scripture say ye are gods
[1:26:14] why christ speak the word
[1:26:17] you realize we're coming into maturity
[1:26:19] we're coming into something that the
[1:26:21] world's never seen
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:24] well they saw it in christ jesus
[1:26:27] they saw a manifestation of an adopted
[1:26:29] son in the prophet
[1:26:31] but that was a a first one to maturity
[1:26:34] a first one in the field
[1:26:36] showing that there's many more suns
[1:26:39] coming into that same maturity why would
[1:26:41] you ever stop short of the fullness of
[1:26:44] the opening of the word being manifested
[1:26:46] in your life
[1:26:49] so the woman at the well had her turn
[1:26:53] and the prophet of god would say oh we
[1:26:55] just need to skip some things
[1:26:58] he's saying possessing all things i'm
[1:27:00] heir of all things amen it's given to me
[1:27:02] i'm heir i can claim everything that
[1:27:04] god's promised me amen there you are
[1:27:06] it's mine how do you get it something
[1:27:08] you've done no sir it's a merited gift
[1:27:10] that god gave us and it's ours it
[1:27:12] belongs to us satan cannot hold it
[1:27:15] if you go to him with the scriptural
[1:27:18] authority of word with faith to say it's
[1:27:20] mine lay it down
[1:27:23] i like that satan you lay it down you
[1:27:25] took it from me you give it back because
[1:27:27] i'm serving notice on you
[1:27:29] i was thinking about that i know i've
[1:27:30] used this quote the last three times i
[1:27:32] preached or so
[1:27:34] i was thinking about that you ever watch
[1:27:36] a kid that you know another kid comes
[1:27:38] and takes their toy
[1:27:41] i'm talking about a younger kid
[1:27:44] who maybe hasn't
[1:27:46] you know
[1:27:47] all they know is that's mine
[1:27:52] and oh my
[1:27:54] you you think something crazy
[1:27:58] happened and you run in there with a
[1:28:02] that's mine
[1:28:04] give it back
[1:28:06] he's like what do you talk about
[1:28:09] he took it from took what that was my
[1:28:12] cheerio
[1:28:15] well look
[1:28:17] that might sound silly
[1:28:20] but i think some of us ought to act that
[1:28:22] way
[1:28:24] if a little child can get upset about a
[1:28:25] little cheerio
[1:28:27] and why are they upset
[1:28:29] because it's theirs
[1:28:31] now why would us
[1:28:33] why would you let the devil come and
[1:28:35] take any promise from you
[1:28:38] why would you let him come and rob you
[1:28:40] of your joy why would you come and let
[1:28:41] them rob you of your peace why would you
[1:28:43] let them take your daughter or your your
[1:28:45] son out there in the world and make you
[1:28:47] feel all bad about it
[1:28:49] make you lose your joy make you lose
[1:28:51] your peace uh make you lose your your
[1:28:53] peace and your family
[1:28:55] i think it's time that you might just
[1:28:57] get a little upset
[1:28:59] and say ah
[1:29:01] you're the devil
[1:29:03] that's mine
[1:29:06] give it back
[1:29:08] and what do some of them kids do
[1:29:10] especially if they're a little bigger
[1:29:13] you got to teach these kids
[1:29:16] they'll go take it back
[1:29:20] you know that's what we're supposed to
[1:29:21] do as sons and daughters of god that's
[1:29:24] what the problem the devil is taking
[1:29:26] something from you you got a right to
[1:29:28] scream out in the name of the lord and
[1:29:30] say give it back
[1:29:32] that's mine
[1:29:33] god gave it to me
[1:29:35] god gave me my church god gave me my
[1:29:37] family god gave me my son god gave me my
[1:29:40] daughter god gave me my health god gave
[1:29:42] me my wife god gave me my peace god gave
[1:29:44] me my joy god gave me my salvation god
[1:29:46] gave me the holy ghost god gave me
[1:29:49] victory in my life and ain't no devil
[1:29:51] ain't nobody gonna take my joy away from
[1:29:53] me oh i'm gonna scream i'm gonna shout
[1:29:56] i'm gonna praise god i'm gonna be
[1:29:58] victorious i'm gonna lift this message
[1:30:00] i'm gonna be free i'm gonna set my wings
[1:30:03] and fly like an eagle above all the
[1:30:05] chaos above all the sin above all the
[1:30:08] sickness in the world
[1:30:10] it's mine give it back
[1:30:16] the devil comes and tries to tell you
[1:30:18] you ain't got the holy oh shut your
[1:30:19] mouth devil
[1:30:23] you ain't gonna go in there shut your
[1:30:24] mouth devil
[1:30:26] god gave it to me
[1:30:30] we're speaking about it's my turn
[1:30:32] isaiah 59 would say when the enemy comes
[1:30:34] in like a flood
[1:30:36] the spirit of the lord shall lift up a
[1:30:38] standard against him where's that
[1:30:39] standard being lifted
[1:30:41] where is that standard being lifted up
[1:30:43] at
[1:30:45] least i want to say lord speaking about
[1:30:47] even in the negative and the positive
[1:30:49] tribulation sickness long-suffering
[1:30:51] you know in war
[1:30:53] they would they would call them the flag
[1:30:54] bearer or they'd even call them the
[1:30:56] standard bear
[1:30:57] and they would have a responsibility of
[1:30:59] carrying the colors
[1:31:01] and there was a a chosen group of people
[1:31:04] that no matter what happened in battle
[1:31:07] if that flag
[1:31:09] ever started to go down
[1:31:12] they would never let that standard go
[1:31:14] down and so they would be bearing the
[1:31:17] flag and if he'd be wounded or he'd be
[1:31:19] struck and that flag would start to go
[1:31:21] down somebody else would grab that flag
[1:31:25] knowing
[1:31:26] it's one of the most defenseless
[1:31:28] positions
[1:31:30] knowing that you're now a target for the
[1:31:33] enemy
[1:31:35] well just let god speak a little bit to
[1:31:36] you
[1:31:38] when you get baptized
[1:31:44] and you profess this message
[1:31:47] you are now a target for all of hell
[1:31:53] and now you are
[1:31:55] holding up the standard you see when
[1:31:57] that flag would start to go down
[1:32:00] the person that's elected and chosen
[1:32:02] that's next there they would grab that
[1:32:04] standard in that word and they would
[1:32:06] lift it up and say
[1:32:08] now it's my turn
[1:32:10] it's my turn to carry the message it's
[1:32:13] my turn to run with the message it's my
[1:32:16] turn to bear the cross it's my turn
[1:32:21] now just
[1:32:25] for a few moments
[1:32:28] the prophet of god would say this in the
[1:32:29] church age book
[1:32:32] as the eternal logos god was manifested
[1:32:34] in the sun
[1:32:36] i just i just pray by the help of the
[1:32:37] holy spirit if
[1:32:38] if if we could just bind together by
[1:32:40] faith
[1:32:42] i believe god has something special for
[1:32:44] us if we could just maybe uh uh uh be
[1:32:47] just united in our faith for just a few
[1:32:49] moments uh
[1:32:51] as the eternal logos god was manifested
[1:32:53] in the sun
[1:32:56] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:32:59] the godhead bodily
[1:33:01] i want to take my time with this because
[1:33:03] i really want you to
[1:33:05] i really want us to catch it
[1:33:07] so
[1:33:09] as the eternal logos maybe if we can put
[1:33:12] that up i would really
[1:33:14] um
[1:33:16] i like kentucky grammar better just
[1:33:20] well you know if you know what i mean
[1:33:23] i just understand it better sometimes
[1:33:27] sometimes the church age book you know
[1:33:28] there's a word in there too you're like
[1:33:30] well i know he didn't say that
[1:33:35] as the eternal logos god
[1:33:40] are we finding that
[1:33:43] we're working on it
[1:33:45] well maybe we read it twice as the
[1:33:46] eternal logos god was manifested in the
[1:33:48] sun and then jesus dwelt all the
[1:33:51] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:33:55] and that eternal one
[1:33:57] was the father
[1:33:59] manifest in flesh
[1:34:01] and thereby gained the title of son
[1:34:05] even so we
[1:34:06] now notice what the prophet's doing now
[1:34:12] even so we so he's showing the very
[1:34:14] thing
[1:34:16] the very way that god was manifested in
[1:34:20] christ jesus
[1:34:24] even so we
[1:34:26] eternal in his thoughts
[1:34:29] in our turn
[1:34:31] became the many-membered spoken word
[1:34:33] seed
[1:34:34] manifest in flesh
[1:34:36] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:34:39] in the flesh
[1:34:40] are the sons of god even as we are so
[1:34:44] called so you are the body of christ
[1:34:48] you are the bride of jesus christ so
[1:34:51] just as christ was manif the
[1:34:53] manifestation of the spoken word
[1:34:56] you are the literal spoken word seed
[1:34:57] bride
[1:34:59] you say what does that mean brother
[1:35:02] what are you trying to say
[1:35:04] so notice
[1:35:06] just as god
[1:35:07] the logos
[1:35:09] was manifested in the flesh
[1:35:12] gaining the title of son
[1:35:14] there comes
[1:35:16] our turn
[1:35:18] for the word to be manifested in our
[1:35:20] flesh
[1:35:23] and that manifestation is the spoken
[1:35:25] word see bride
[1:35:27] or the body of christ
[1:35:32] in a church age book he goes on to say
[1:35:33] those in the bride do only his will so
[1:35:35] what does that mean if jesus christ
[1:35:39] was that word made flesh
[1:35:41] and you
[1:35:42] are that word made flesh
[1:35:44] those in the bride do only his will
[1:35:47] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:35:50] have thus saith the lord or they keep
[1:35:51] still they know that it has to be god in
[1:35:54] them doing the works fulfilling his own
[1:35:55] word he did not complete all his work
[1:35:58] while in his earthly ministry so now
[1:36:01] where is he working
[1:36:03] now he works in and through the ride
[1:36:07] she knows that
[1:36:09] for it was not yet time for him to do
[1:36:11] certain things that he must do now
[1:36:14] that he must now do but he will now
[1:36:16] fulfill through the bride
[1:36:18] that work which he left for this
[1:36:20] specific time
[1:36:22] what does that mean it's god in you
[1:36:25] it's god in you
[1:36:27] it's god fulfilling his own word in you
[1:36:30] and through you
[1:36:33] i'm taking my time notice as god the
[1:36:36] logos was manifested in jesus
[1:36:39] in the flesh
[1:36:40] even so we
[1:36:43] his eternal thoughts
[1:36:45] in our turn
[1:36:47] became the word manifested in the flesh
[1:36:52] and our turn
[1:36:54] now now here's a little of my
[1:36:56] inspiration if we could just
[1:36:57] by god's grace move through here real
[1:36:59] quick
[1:37:01] in our turn
[1:37:04] what did we read in our opening text was
[1:37:06] in hebrews we read about all the
[1:37:08] patriarchs and all those that went
[1:37:10] through before and by faith and by faith
[1:37:14] look abel by faith
[1:37:17] offered a more excellent sacrifice under
[1:37:20] god than cain
[1:37:22] abel had his turn
[1:37:26] enoch by faith
[1:37:28] was translated
[1:37:30] and he had this testimony
[1:37:33] he pleased god look enoch had his turn
[1:37:38] oh glory to god
[1:37:40] don't you write what was he it was the
[1:37:41] word
[1:37:42] being manifested
[1:37:45] in them
[1:37:48] job job was sitting there in his trial
[1:37:52] but it was in that trial in that moment
[1:37:54] that job had his turn to bring forth the
[1:37:58] revelation
[1:38:00] that by that revelation of him saying
[1:38:02] look though the skin worms
[1:38:04] destroy this body
[1:38:06] though they eat up this flesh i know
[1:38:07] that i'm going to stand and see my
[1:38:10] redeemer and it was by that revelation
[1:38:14] that abraham and then all the patriarchs
[1:38:17] buried their bones because they knew
[1:38:19] that's where the resurrection was going
[1:38:20] to be
[1:38:22] he had his turn
[1:38:26] what did what did the
[1:38:28] when everything was going on said job
[1:38:31] where were you when the sons of god
[1:38:33] shouted for joy
[1:38:36] i want to say it like this
[1:38:41] when
[1:38:42] when
[1:38:42] moses met the logos there
[1:38:47] the pillar of fire in the burning bush
[1:38:51] where were you
[1:38:53] i want to say i was there
[1:38:57] but i was just waiting my turn
[1:39:02] it was moses's turn
[1:39:06] when moses
[1:39:07] and the and the lord and the pillar fire
[1:39:09] come down and split the red sea and they
[1:39:12] walked upon dry land i was there
[1:39:18] i wasn't in the flesh
[1:39:20] but i was there i have to be
[1:39:22] because i'm
[1:39:24] identified when manna fell from the sky
[1:39:29] and they ate manna in the wilderness i
[1:39:31] was there
[1:39:34] but what was i doing i was waiting for
[1:39:36] my turn
[1:39:38] oh glory to god
[1:39:41] oh and moses struck the rock and water
[1:39:44] came forth and they drank from the rock
[1:39:47] i was there
[1:39:48] and as the prophet would say and i'm
[1:39:50] still drinking tonight
[1:39:54] yes i was there but i was waiting for my
[1:39:57] turn
[1:39:58] oh glory to god
[1:40:01] hallelujah and i just want to say this
[1:40:05] eve had her chance at the word you know
[1:40:06] the prophet of god said every generation
[1:40:08] has a chance at a word at the word they
[1:40:11] have a chance at a revival and when eve
[1:40:13] had her chance
[1:40:15] oh just let
[1:40:16] well let's preach for a little bit now
[1:40:18] we're on the home stretch
[1:40:20] eve had her chance at the word
[1:40:23] and when when when satan came to her she
[1:40:26] had a chance to stand for the word and
[1:40:29] turn down satan's lie but when she was
[1:40:32] given the chance she turned the word of
[1:40:34] god down and she failed
[1:40:37] and because of that because adam and he
[1:40:40] fell it brought forth every death it
[1:40:41] brought forth every sickness and every
[1:40:44] time man came
[1:40:46] that's what job was talking about lord i
[1:40:48] see every time
[1:40:50] i see the life going to the ground
[1:40:53] and in the springtime
[1:40:56] the life comes back out in the trees but
[1:40:58] where is the resurrection for man
[1:41:02] see job had to go by the way of the
[1:41:04] grave david had to go by the way of the
[1:41:06] grave many of the patriarchs they had
[1:41:08] every single one of them went by the way
[1:41:10] of the grave except for a few that we
[1:41:12] know of enoch and elisha and moses body
[1:41:16] being taken away and hidden
[1:41:19] but every time man
[1:41:21] had their turn to face death
[1:41:25] every one of them went by the grave
[1:41:29] but i was excited as i thought about
[1:41:31] this in my heart
[1:41:32] that there came one man
[1:41:34] as god built back his masterpiece
[1:41:37] and there stood his great masterpiece in
[1:41:39] jesus christ standing upon the earth
[1:41:41] what was he doing there in his first
[1:41:43] ministry
[1:41:45] he was coming to pay the penalty for sin
[1:41:48] and all i was just thinking of how he
[1:41:50] come to face that horrible death on the
[1:41:52] cross and there the devil said aha
[1:41:55] come is time for dying i got him now
[1:41:59] i finally got them now
[1:42:03] when i was just rejoicing in my heart i
[1:42:05] thought about as there
[1:42:07] as the lord i laid down his life there
[1:42:09] on calvary and he paid the price and you
[1:42:12] can imagine the imps in hell and satan
[1:42:13] and all them like well we were really
[1:42:15] scared there for a moment you know he
[1:42:16] did raise the dead he did open some
[1:42:18] blind eyes he did perform some miracles
[1:42:20] on earth that we had never seen but we
[1:42:22] finally got him now no man has ever been
[1:42:26] able to cheat the curse
[1:42:28] we got them now oh maybe devil was just
[1:42:31] celebrating the devil in his imps we'll
[1:42:33] celebrate there in hell on the first day
[1:42:36] and the second day and on that third day
[1:42:38] there come a little knock
[1:42:42] who is that
[1:42:44] who could that be i don't know
[1:42:46] and i just imagine the devil went over
[1:42:48] there and he opened up the door
[1:42:51] and he looked like he saw a ghost
[1:42:54] and the lord jesus was standing there
[1:42:57] and i just imagined him looking at the
[1:42:58] devil he said it's my turn
[1:43:02] it's my turn and he ripped the keys off
[1:43:05] of the side slammed the door on him and
[1:43:07] he left captivity captive oh there was a
[1:43:10] great resurrection and he ascended on up
[1:43:12] into glory
[1:43:14] oh it's my turn and because jesus christ
[1:43:17] took his turn
[1:43:19] oh glory to god why was i waiting for
[1:43:22] mine
[1:43:24] because god saw fit that he'd place you
[1:43:26] in ladies
[1:43:29] his very eternal thoughts that he had of
[1:43:31] you oh moses had his turn abel had his
[1:43:34] turn enoch had his turn david had his
[1:43:36] turn peter james and john paul brother
[1:43:39] branham they all had their turn but now
[1:43:43] it's your turn to manifest the message
[1:43:47] oh
[1:43:48] glory to god
[1:43:50] hallelujah i'm excited about that look
[1:43:52] i'm identified by the blood i'm
[1:43:54] identified by a spirit i'm identified by
[1:43:57] the word
[1:44:00] don't you know who you are
[1:44:03] this is your turn
[1:44:05] this is your house you are the eternal
[1:44:07] thoughts of god that are being
[1:44:09] manifested
[1:44:12] well that makes me excited
[1:44:14] do you know what that makes you
[1:44:18] invincible
[1:44:20] eternal
[1:44:22] victorious
[1:44:24] a mighty conqueror
[1:44:26] your bone of his bone your flesh of his
[1:44:28] flesh
[1:44:30] well if the musicians will come
[1:44:32] we won't ask him to play right away but
[1:44:34] it gives y'all hope
[1:44:38] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:44:39] he says for you are only the physical
[1:44:42] manifestation of the attributes that was
[1:44:44] in god at the beginning
[1:44:46] for there is only one form of eternal
[1:44:48] life and that was you before
[1:44:51] you don't know nothing about it neither
[1:44:53] did you know when you were in your
[1:44:54] earthly father
[1:44:56] but you are manifested in his image
[1:44:59] in the image of god you are made and you
[1:45:01] are manifested for his glory and his
[1:45:03] fellowship of god
[1:45:04] don't let this pass you by
[1:45:07] there's a creative power in the word
[1:45:10] he is the word
[1:45:14] the woman at the well had her turn
[1:45:17] is this any different
[1:45:19] has the word lost its power
[1:45:21] or or does there need to be a physical
[1:45:24] manifestation for you to believe
[1:45:29] well if we
[1:45:30] were listening
[1:45:32] to what thus saith the lord was saying
[1:45:36] you are the physical manifestation
[1:45:38] of the word
[1:45:40] are we just playing church
[1:45:43] are we just looking back 60 70 years to
[1:45:46] to a prophet
[1:45:48] who is able to
[1:45:50] make the word live
[1:45:51] and we're incapable
[1:45:53] that's not what this message came for
[1:45:56] this message has the same power
[1:45:59] the same life
[1:46:00] the same effects
[1:46:02] the same action
[1:46:06] we're talking about the attributes of
[1:46:07] god
[1:46:08] look we we know oh we just we just we
[1:46:11] just skip we'll just move
[1:46:13] to to to our clothes here
[1:46:15] but we know that the word has been uh
[1:46:18] restored down through the ages
[1:46:21] and i just maybe want to end here
[1:46:23] i'm finding
[1:46:24] i'm i just
[1:46:27] i want to bring this home by god's help
[1:46:32] i'm really wanting something in your
[1:46:34] heart to anchor
[1:46:37] that you are the manifestation of this
[1:46:39] message
[1:46:40] and as each one played out their part
[1:46:43] and each one had their turn and even now
[1:46:44] the prophet said just as jesus christ
[1:46:47] was the logos made flesh
[1:46:49] and because he was made flesh by that he
[1:46:52] gained the title of son he says even so
[1:46:54] you
[1:46:55] even so you and your turn you were also
[1:46:58] the thoughts of god
[1:47:00] but your turn wasn't back there your
[1:47:02] turn is now god saw fit that he would
[1:47:04] manifest you what do you bypass your
[1:47:07] theophany you were with him in the very
[1:47:09] beginning
[1:47:11] and now you've come here that in your
[1:47:13] turn you would manifest the very
[1:47:15] thoughts that god had towards you
[1:47:20] for god hath commanded
[1:47:22] the light to shine out of the darkness
[1:47:25] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[1:47:27] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[1:47:29] god
[1:47:30] in the face of jesus christ
[1:47:32] but we have this treasure in earth and
[1:47:34] vessels
[1:47:36] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:47:39] of god and not of us

[1:51:43] traditions he didn't come to their
[1:51:45] temples he didn't come to their priest
[1:51:48] but he came in a manger
[1:51:52] when god decided to open the seven seals
