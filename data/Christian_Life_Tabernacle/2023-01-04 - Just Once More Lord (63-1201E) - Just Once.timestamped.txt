[5:39] Placer just said yeah yes now I do and
[5:42] uh the children
[5:45] I remember a few years ago Minneapolis
[5:47] they were little bitty fellas now I have
[5:49] to look up to them here great big boy
[5:52] and girl
[5:54] sister stats Cliff you're not long ago
[5:56] then really had my heart whirling around
[5:59] a little mother
[6:02] she lost her baby
[6:04] and the Lord
[6:06] was seen fit to take it away and she'd
[6:09] call me and she wanted to go fly me over
[6:11] to Germany and the doctor was so kind to
[6:14] wait and let the baby lay there the
[6:16] little fellow died suddenly a sweet
[6:18] little plumpy girl
[6:19] and sister staz Clifford lost her mother
[6:22] and she's pretty well broke up this baby
[6:25] certainly had got the best of her and
[6:28] she got on the phone long distance from
[6:30] Germany and wanted to fly over and I
[6:32] said sister stats cliff
[6:34] she confessed her faith and she believed
[6:37] that the Lord Jesus had sent me for the
[6:39] work in the last days and it's a loyal
[6:42] testimony and no one could give a shame
[6:44] in it with all of her heart she had seen
[6:47] the Lord God do such things as that
[6:48] raise up the dead after they were dead
[6:51] but you see you really as much as I how
[6:55] what a glory that would have been to God
[6:57] in Germany and everything if I could
[6:59] have done it myself I would have done it
[7:02] but the first thing we mustn't go until
[7:04] we know what we're going for
[7:06] so I went out and prayed and I think she
[7:09] stayed on the phone part of the time
[7:11] through the night and the next day I
[7:12] come in there was nothing again meaty
[7:14] said my wife said sister saska called
[7:16] twice any word from the law again I said
[7:19] not a thing and I said well I went out
[7:21] Pray Again is in the woods that night
[7:24] then of course the little baby had to be
[7:26] taken care of and then just as I was
[7:28] coming in the Lord Jesus Vision struck
[7:30] standing from him and I heard his voice
[7:32] said don't rebuke that that's the hand
[7:35] of the Lord
[7:36] so I knew then that God for some reason
[7:39] had taken her baby to glory and it was a
[7:43] certainly against the will of the Lord
[7:45] for me to say anything contrary to it
[7:48] and then I thought well that'll be a big
[7:51] letdown another one thing I did on
[7:52] minded the Lord I did what he told me
[7:54] you're not long ago I got a letter from
[7:56] a minister over there
[7:58] and he had made a statement sent by some
[8:00] more ministers he said the one and he
[8:03] was I think he might have been a German
[8:05] Lutheran I'm not sure but he said
[8:07] there's one thing that I can admire
[8:09] about brother Branham when all the
[8:10] excitement is going on he stayed steady
[8:12] until he got a clear-cut decision from
[8:15] God then he knows what he was doing
[8:16] that's the only way you can do those
[8:18] things is first year from the Lord
[8:21] when he tells if he told me tonight that
[8:24] to go up there and raise out of that
[8:27] Cemetery President Kennedy I'd invite
[8:31] the whole world to come watch it done
[8:33] where I'd have dust saith the Lord
[8:37] now but how can I say thus saith the
[8:40] Lord until the Lord has said thus
[8:42] right right
[8:44] many times people gets all excited go
[8:46] under Impressions and things like that
[8:48] and want their best of their middle can
[8:50] think that ain't always true wait till
[8:53] he tells you and you know it then you've
[8:55] got exactly you don't have to guess
[8:57] about it he's done told you it's thus
[8:59] saith the Lord then he's told you and
[9:01] then you can go say what he said until
[9:03] then you can go and do everything you
[9:06] can do what you can yourself but you
[9:09] can't be sure until God has said so then
[9:12] you're positive on the table what time
[9:15] is it sirs many of these got to take I
[9:18] could speak for the chapters and
[9:21] anywhere else and say it's thus saith
[9:23] the Lord I'll meet seven angels and
[9:25] it'll be known the country's over see
[9:28] and something's fixing to happen before
[9:30] he told me there it was
[9:32] just the three months afterwards see all
[9:35] these other things when you when you the
[9:37] Lord is spoken it's got to happen
[9:40] that's the reason that I know that his
[9:43] word is perfect
[9:45] no matter what people think about it
[9:48] it's the word of God that's right that's
[9:51] thus saith the Lord right
[9:54] that's and we know that that's true
[9:56] Jesus is coming
[9:58] when I don't know
[10:00] what farm how you come I have an idea
[10:03] but I don't know it's wrote in here he
[10:06] said I if I be taken up you draw a man
[10:10] to him and he would come again I know
[10:12] he's coming
[10:13] oh that's positive
[10:16] and it doesn't matter to me what it is
[10:18] see if it's tonight or if it's next year
[10:21] or if it's a thousand years from now
[10:23] just so he comes I got eternal life I
[10:27] ain't going to be any older I'm just
[10:28] going to be there when he comes that's
[10:30] all that's it doesn't matter to me when
[10:33] how which way he does it just so I'm
[10:36] there and he promised me that I would be
[10:38] there and he has already give me eternal
[10:40] life
[10:41] because he said he that can receive my
[10:44] words
[10:45] and Believe on him that sent me has
[10:48] eternal life and shall not come to the
[10:50] Judgment but passed from Death To Life
[10:53] that's good enough for me right there
[10:56] that's my absolute that's my absolute he
[10:59] promised it there's no way for it to
[11:01] ever fail it just cannot fail
[11:04] no more than God can fail it's
[11:06] impossible for God to fail that's one
[11:09] thing that God cannot do fail
[11:13] you can't fail aren't you happy for that
[11:17] I begin to see the years counting up
[11:20] and begin to see it two or three
[11:23] services a day he's beginning to make me
[11:25] get just a little bit tired or it used
[11:27] to didn't bother me but then I think
[11:29] well what difference does it make
[11:32] I want to ask you something
[11:34] we're just Home Folks so on that what if
[11:37] you're 80 years old tonight or you're 15
[11:40] years old tonight if you're 80 years old
[11:42] and you live till this time tomorrow
[11:44] night you'll outlive many many young 16
[11:46] year old children
[11:49] you ever think of that
[11:50] sure will
[11:52] you're here for a purpose
[11:54] to serve God
[11:56] so what difference in the age it is to
[11:58] you you serve God
[12:00] if God come to me and said I want you to
[12:03] go to Earth and uh and I was up there
[12:05] and he said go to Earth I'm going to
[12:06] give you a 100 Year space of the
[12:09] knowledge but I want you to Lodge your
[12:11] years what years you want to take the
[12:14] first 25 the second 25 the third 25 are
[12:19] the last of 25. what would I see well if
[12:23] I'm going to put my time here to be a oh
[12:26] uh a football player or an athlete or
[12:29] something I better take the first 25. if
[12:32] I'm gonna be here to be a carpenter or
[12:35] some person like that well I better take
[12:38] the second 25.
[12:40] but if I want to take
[12:42] to serve the Lord I'll take the last 25
[12:45] from 75 to 100 because I've had the
[12:49] accumulation of that much knowledge I'll
[12:50] know more about it as long as I stand on
[12:53] my two feet walk around what difference
[12:55] will make how old I am I'm here to serve
[12:57] the Lord and that's it
[12:59] amen
[13:01] that's good enough for me he promised it
[13:03] now I want to thank each and every one
[13:06] of you for your kindness and uh trusting
[13:10] that the Lord willing at at again we'll
[13:13] meet somewhere in this earth if not the
[13:16] more here we will on the other side and
[13:19] the Lord blessed I want to pray over
[13:21] these handkerchiefs as soon as we get
[13:23] into the message we don't or just
[13:25] exactly what'll happen
[13:26] we tried to put a couple nights in the
[13:29] three about three nights of the five or
[13:31] six five nights of Lee the lord gave us
[13:34] a calling among the people of uh calling
[13:38] the people out where the Lord would heal
[13:40] him and then we had a one night last
[13:43] night we brought every person that want
[13:45] to be prayed right through the prayer
[13:46] line and prayed for him and I have
[13:50] hope that I haven't failed anywhere to
[13:53] try to do everything that I know how to
[13:54] do for us being better spiritual
[13:57] condition and physical condition tonight
[13:59] than we were when we come in here about
[14:01] four or five nights ago
[14:04] if I failed God forgive me and you
[14:06] forgive me now for the closing message
[14:08] and I'm going to try to make it just
[14:10] quick as possible because I I preach
[14:14] long and I I've told my congregation and
[14:18] so forth at beginning the first year I'm
[14:21] going to try to I've tried it for the
[14:23] last 35 years if it's been a Ministry to
[14:26] cut down from this two hours and so
[14:28] forth down to 30 minutes but I'm so slow
[14:32] I can't say what I want to say in 30
[14:34] minutes
[14:36] I'm a southerner you know and so I I
[14:38] just have to okay think of it too fast I
[14:41] just got the weight and see I got to
[14:43] wait on him for my words
[14:46] uh
[14:49] just as long as I can wait on him and
[14:51] you'll just be patient with me now let's
[14:54] read some scripture so we know that this
[14:57] won't pass away and as we have our
[14:59] little uh get together of friendship and
[15:02] talking before we approach this real
[15:04] sacred part of the service bringing the
[15:07] bread of life
[15:08] let's just pray again
[15:10] Lord Jesus now we are grateful to you
[15:15] we're all turning to you to thank you
[15:17] for this great days and nights of
[15:20] service Fellowship around the word and
[15:23] with the people we're grateful Lord our
[15:26] Spirits has been lifted up and we're so
[15:28] thankful that we've been able to sit in
[15:30] Heavenly places with you
[15:33] and our father on this great and last
[15:35] night of the the love Feast may you
[15:39] stand in the midst of us again tonight
[15:41] you cry he that's thirsty come unto me
[15:44] Granite Lord we know you will because
[15:47] you do it that's your way of doing
[15:50] things and you never change it and I
[15:52] pray God that you'll break the bread of
[15:54] life to us may we be able to receive
[15:57] that word into our heart that will open
[15:59] a fountain of blessings to all of us
[16:02] bless the reading of the word and help
[16:05] me as I try to break the bread of life
[16:08] to the congregation for whatever the
[16:10] need is in Jesus Christ's name amen
[16:15] let's turn to the uh the book of the
[16:18] judges
[16:19] uh the judges of Israel and I want to
[16:23] turn to the 16th chapter of judges
[16:27] to read a portion of the of the word
[16:30] judges the 16th chapter and I want to
[16:33] read the 27th and the 28th verses
[16:38] now the house is full of man and women
[16:41] and all the Lords of the Philistines
[16:45] were there
[16:46] and there were up on the roof about 3
[16:49] 000 men and women
[16:52] the hell the hell was Samson made sport
[16:57] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[17:00] oh Lord God remember me I pray thee
[17:04] and strengthen me I pray thee only this
[17:08] once O Lord that I may be
[17:12] once Avenged of the Philistines for my
[17:15] two eyes
[17:19] what a pitiful sight
[17:23] and this little subject
[17:25] I'm going to take a takes out of any
[17:27] calling
[17:29] just once more Lord
[17:31] just once more
[17:34] must have been a hot day it had a great
[17:37] celebration
[17:39] and
[17:40] it makes me feel bad every time I think
[17:43] of it because the nature of that
[17:47] religious celebration
[17:50] uh you know a celebration's all right
[17:53] but it's according to the nature of the
[17:55] celebration
[17:57] and this was one celebration that I
[18:01] certainly hate to refer to
[18:04] it was in the land of the Philistines
[18:08] and they were celebrating it just makes
[18:11] me feel bad to say it
[18:13] victory over God's servants
[18:18] God's disobedient servant
[18:21] had brought a reproach upon the name of
[18:24] the Lord and went down in defeat and
[18:29] these Philistines were celebrating
[18:33] the the great time of victory that their
[18:37] fish God had gotten victory over
[18:40] Jehovah's servant
[18:43] if that isn't a text they end up a
[18:45] meeting on
[18:47] but I felt led as I was looking through
[18:49] some five or six hundred texts that I
[18:51] had there
[18:52] my eyes dropped up on this texture and I
[18:55] thought I believe I'll just uh talk
[18:58] about that a little while tonight
[18:59] and maybe that's what the Holy Spirit
[19:01] would want us to know something about in
[19:03] here
[19:05] um
[19:07] about
[19:08] hot day I believe and the sacrifices was
[19:12] burning and the fire around this great
[19:14] fish God
[19:16] and there were three thousand
[19:18] Philistines looking down
[19:21] at the pair as they entered the great
[19:24] Stadium
[19:26] it must have been like a mushroom a way
[19:29] that fixed it I like I'd say something
[19:32] on the order of a of a mushroom or
[19:35] Toadstool turned up like this with two
[19:38] great uh pile Esters or or pillows
[19:41] holding up the stadium as it's set like
[19:43] a more on this shape maybe it so that
[19:47] the people in this great Stadium could
[19:50] look down to the entertainment that was
[19:52] going on down on the main floor
[19:55] and
[19:57] highly polished Warlords attended that
[20:00] meeting and their fine Jewel the ladies
[20:04] was at the meeting
[20:07] and they all stopped suddenly to lean
[20:11] forward the main event was just about to
[20:14] take place
[20:16] we have uh sometimes what we call the
[20:18] preliminaries
[20:20] they and then the introduction the
[20:23] Prelude to the uh the main event
[20:26] that had much entertainment as they did
[20:29] sometimes sacrificing and killing and so
[20:33] forth but now the the main event was
[20:36] just about to take place and all this
[20:39] bunch of fine celebrity of all the uh
[20:43] the regions in the Philistines land they
[20:47] raised up because they were a privilege
[20:49] they were setting up in this big uh we
[20:51] call it like a mushroom
[20:53] and perhaps the poor and so forth were
[20:57] down here on the on the floor but they
[20:59] set up where they could get a good look
[21:01] and see all the entertainment it was a
[21:03] it was a celebrity box
[21:06] three thousand of them the air was
[21:09] stinking with drinks
[21:11] drunken reverie all day drinking and
[21:14] slobbering and carrying on
[21:17] the way a drunken brawl can be like that
[21:20] and they all stood up because the main
[21:22] event was about to take place and they
[21:25] leaned over they wanted to get a good
[21:28] look
[21:30] they couldn't afford to miss this
[21:32] well this is the main event
[21:35] what did they see a little boy leading a
[21:40] blind man
[21:41] out to the middle of the floor
[21:44] in the celebration of the fish God Dagon
[21:50] the lion LED this stumbling blind
[21:54] book of Flesh blind and to the post and
[22:00] stood him by the side of the post
[22:02] to make sport
[22:05] so this is sense
[22:08] a man that was a an outstanding servant
[22:13] of God
[22:15] now he stands there humiliated
[22:19] blind weakened
[22:21] a disgraced
[22:24] it's a picture of us
[22:27] of a demoralized sunken
[22:30] generation
[22:32] it's a picture of of a of a Nation
[22:37] that has lost his hope with God
[22:39] it's a picture of a church
[22:42] that's lost its hold on God's word
[22:46] because that's what Samson represented
[22:49] here you heliated broken
[22:52] he was in a terrible condition as he sat
[22:55] there or stood there rather
[22:58] so
[23:00] could you imagine him standing this
[23:02] great man that one time what he could do
[23:05] and here he is standing here in that
[23:07] condition
[23:08] you humiliated as I said broken a symbol
[23:11] and I want to
[23:14] declare tonight this symbol represents
[23:17] the very hour that we're now living
[23:20] the condition of the church now
[23:24] broken
[23:26] out of the word of the Lord
[23:29] humiliated out of its place
[23:32] and the question is coming today the
[23:35] handwritings on the wall and who can
[23:37] read it
[23:40] they know nothing about it
[23:44] let's take and search the minds of those
[23:47] Philistines
[23:49] this man's very name Samson at one time
[23:54] caused the whole nation to tremble
[23:57] just mention Samson
[24:01] cause God was with him
[24:04] and the Nations tremble because of his
[24:07] very name
[24:09] that's the same way it used to be the
[24:11] name of Jesus Christ
[24:14] but now it it's used as a curse word
[24:17] jokes
[24:20] there don't seem to be any more
[24:21] reverence to it
[24:23] well that's name is above every name
[24:25] there's ever named on Mortal tongues
[24:30] it's a name that even it's a high
[24:33] exalted above every name that's in
[24:35] heaven
[24:36] every name upon the Earth
[24:39] and all the family in Heaven and Earth
[24:41] is named
[24:44] and yet man take it in curse words
[24:47] church members use it in jokes
[24:51] and Many religious leaders blasphemen
[24:57] with their Creeds
[25:00] that's the reason that we're humiliated
[25:04] in the face of communism romanism
[25:08] and protestantism and the things that's
[25:12] rising in the Earth today and
[25:15] that's the reason that we're humiliated
[25:18] we ought to know these answers
[25:21] God's got it in his book for this day
[25:26] went to something else
[25:28] forgot about it
[25:31] many of the Philistines as they stood
[25:34] there of them great Warriors No Doubt
[25:37] somebody announced that the next event
[25:40] is Samson
[25:44] many of those Warriors but they're fine
[25:47] jeweled polished up uh women looked over
[25:52] the banisher and remembered
[25:55] seeing Samson stand in a different way
[25:57] one time
[25:59] when the spirit of the Lord was upon him
[26:03] standing with the Jawbone of a mule in
[26:06] his hands
[26:07] with a thousand Philistines laying
[26:10] around him and they'd run to a rock
[26:12] somewhere to take refuge
[26:15] when a man
[26:17] picked up the Jawbone of a mule that had
[26:20] been laying on the desert anyone knows
[26:23] that one hit on a rock or anything with
[26:27] that bone would shatter it to pieces
[26:29] and those helmets some of them was an
[26:31] inch to inch and a half thick of brass
[26:34] and this man was not a soldier
[26:39] and he was the trained man for for the
[26:42] spirit and Philistines with a coat of
[26:45] Nao mail that is laced over lap over
[26:49] like a jealousy window but the metal
[26:52] that keeps Spears and things from
[26:54] hitting them and also with helmets and
[26:57] with shields and with Spears and they
[27:00] surrounded this man's Samson and thought
[27:02] the great uh cream of the army would be
[27:06] able to take this man
[27:08] and he had nothing in his hand he found
[27:10] it all
[27:11] dry Jawbone of the new and he began to
[27:16] hit right and left until he beat down a
[27:19] thousand Philistines
[27:22] why the Bible said the spirit of the
[27:26] Lord was upon him
[27:29] here he's still different now
[27:33] he'd give away his secret
[27:36] and they clearly couldn't remember him
[27:38] there might have been another group up
[27:41] there could remember one night
[27:43] and one Delilah had Bewitched him into
[27:45] the uh the city of Gaza
[27:50] and their clothes or big Gates probably
[27:52] when a ton or more a piece great big
[27:56] brass gates to the city that had iron
[27:59] bars and it went back into the rocks
[28:03] and fast with such hinges that we
[28:05] wouldn't have such like it today
[28:08] and they said the Philistines be upon
[28:11] these Samson and man the soldiers
[28:13] standing around the gate
[28:16] and was speechless when he could break
[28:19] the cards walk down and they scattered
[28:22] like a bunch of roaches at night time
[28:24] when the lights turned on
[28:27] the spirit of the Lord upon Him reached
[28:30] over jerk one gate out jerked the other
[28:32] night and put it on his shoulder and
[28:33] walked up the hill and sat down
[28:37] they can remember that
[28:39] what a warrior
[28:41] many of them could remember that
[28:45] a semen and great victory
[28:48] but look at him now
[28:51] that's a picture of the church
[28:54] I can read in the Bible
[28:58] of the church
[29:00] when he was first filled with the Holy
[29:02] Ghost
[29:03] great signs and wonders accompany their
[29:07] meetings
[29:09] we can remember a few years ago 40 or 50
[29:12] years ago when the church was filled
[29:15] with that same power but look at it
[29:17] today
[29:19] she stands stripped
[29:24] something a stricter the same thing the
[29:28] stripped Samson
[29:31] all calls by listening to a woman
[29:35] a tuck it in
[29:37] and what stripped the church is
[29:39] listening to that organized woman
[29:42] situation that old Jezebel
[29:47] the very thing that Samson had been
[29:50] raised up to defeat had defeated him
[29:55] and the Pentecostal church tonight
[29:57] stands in those same tracks the very
[30:00] thing she was raised up to defeat
[30:03] denominationalism she has grouped
[30:05] herself back into it again and her
[30:07] power's gone
[30:10] right
[30:13] the power of the Lord
[30:16] laughter we ought to know that every
[30:20] time through history that a church ever
[30:23] organized God left it right then it fell
[30:26] and never did rise again
[30:29] and Pentecost was something that come
[30:32] out of the denomination
[30:36] but what it was we adopted man-made
[30:39] leadership instead of the Holy Ghost
[30:45] that's exactly what Samson done
[30:49] foreign
[30:50] think of it what a Musta went through
[30:53] that man's mind
[30:54] while he stood there
[30:57] he must have thought of all the great
[30:59] victories God had given
[31:01] the great things that God had done
[31:04] with him and for him
[31:07] and and how
[31:10] that while he was with God the power of
[31:14] His Spirit and the joy and the peace
[31:17] that he had
[31:18] while he was with God
[31:30] nation that Samson was raised up to
[31:34] destroy had him bound
[31:39] and the very thing that God raised
[31:42] Pentecost to do has abound
[31:46] get the fellowship fit the power
[31:52] fussing stewing
[31:54] lukewarm members
[31:58] find things great everything that they'd
[32:01] be better off if they if they had the
[32:03] old Salvation Army drum or the little
[32:06] old guitar down on the corner somewhere
[32:08] again I gotta have it like that and to
[32:11] have our Cathedrals that we're getting
[32:12] costing millions of dollars
[32:17] but very soon he had failed
[32:21] I was a prisoner of the very nation and
[32:24] God raised him up to destroy
[32:26] they had him
[32:28] had it to entertain them
[32:30] that's all it is today
[32:33] some kind of a little gimmick
[32:40] to try to entertain them
[32:44] let a woman lure him from the promised
[32:48] word of God
[32:51] that's the same thing the church did
[32:55] and has let a woman Jezebel the mother
[32:58] of Hearts represented in Revelation 17
[33:02] lure them right back into the vomit that
[33:06] they come out of
[33:09] as the Bible says as a hog go returns to
[33:13] its water and a dog to its vomit
[33:18] and as long as that hog remains a hog
[33:22] he'll his nature is a hog he'll go right
[33:26] back to the water
[33:30] and you're the only way you'll keep him
[33:32] out of the mud hole is to change his
[33:35] nature
[33:37] that's the only way you're gonna go to
[33:38] ever get any differs in the church today
[33:41] has got to have a change of nature
[33:44] instead of some ecclesiastical system
[33:46] leading the preachers around it'll take
[33:49] the Holy Ghost to the word to lead them
[33:52] back to that God-fearing spirit of God
[33:57] that's right
[33:58] if the doll vomit and it made him sick
[34:02] at his stomach the first time when he
[34:03] made him sick again
[34:05] and if God called us out of such a mess
[34:09] because it why I want to do the same
[34:12] thing again then we go right back into
[34:14] it the same thing
[34:15] it should never be done
[34:18] this Jezebel system now blind
[34:22] spiritually
[34:23] I'm saying
[34:24] to the word of God
[34:27] joining themselves right into the
[34:29] Council of churches
[34:31] everything our great Evangelical
[34:33] teaching we have to Forfeit that to be
[34:36] an organization because all
[34:38] organizations that isn't in this Council
[34:41] churches I got the paper on it that even
[34:44] if your church is not in this counselor
[34:47] churches
[34:48] a time of trouble they can use your
[34:50] church to story emanation or anything
[34:52] they want to and if any man is caught
[34:55] having a prayer for anybody outside of
[35:00] uh affiliating with this counselor
[35:02] churches can be shot as a federal
[35:04] offense
[35:06] that's right
[35:07] I got the papers art from Washington
[35:11] you're they're going to force you into
[35:13] it that's why I've been against this
[35:15] organizational system
[35:17] that's it I had to keep it quiet about
[35:20] being the mark of the beast but it's
[35:21] late enough now that you can know it's
[35:22] the truth
[35:25] it is it's exactly that
[35:28] now
[35:29] what has it done it's brought the church
[35:32] stripped of its power
[35:34] nothing but name
[35:36] it pictures it exactly in Revelation 3
[35:39] the lady osia Church age rejected Christ
[35:43] and on the outside
[35:44] exactly why it did just its act like its
[35:48] mother did
[35:49] went back to the denominational
[35:52] Pentecost born out of denomination
[35:56] born out of that
[35:58] and as soon as he got a bunch
[36:00] of a bunch in from some school and they
[36:03] had to have seminaries and things to
[36:05] instead of upper rooms
[36:08] and now many of the big churches
[36:11] a man has to pass a psychiatrist test
[36:15] before he's permitted to be a overseas
[36:18] missionary
[36:21] the first church didn't have to test a
[36:23] psychiatrist test but they had to go to
[36:26] the test of the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:30] what made the difference
[36:32] notice
[36:34] Samson giveaway is secret to Delilah
[36:39] she finally loved him and patted him and
[36:43] told him he was a nice man how she loved
[36:46] him until she found where the secret was
[36:51] then she bobbed off the secret
[36:54] that's exactly the way old mother
[36:57] Jezebel has done the Protestant church
[37:00] has crocked in and now they're
[37:02] compromising on a few little doctrines
[37:04] that said to have so they can have Unity
[37:06] over the world and the first place the
[37:09] church got her locks bobbed off was it
[37:12] nice here and she's going to Bob him
[37:15] again since she's been here
[37:19] that's your secret is the word
[37:22] if you abide me in my word and you can
[37:25] ask what you will it'll be done for you
[37:28] that's where they lose their secret
[37:31] now look at him defeated just like
[37:34] Samson was ministers instead of being
[37:36] born as David duplicit said one time God
[37:40] don't have Pentecostal grandchildren but
[37:43] that's why you say my mother was
[37:44] Pentecostal she had an experience she
[37:46] did this my father did so and so that
[37:48] ain't got nothing to do with you you got
[37:51] to have the same thing
[37:54] now we got cemeteries that hatch out our
[37:57] ministers then we're building bigger
[37:58] ones all the time
[38:00] and um and we got students
[38:03] of psychology and that's all right if
[38:06] you want to teach psychology I don't
[38:08] care about psychology I just want to
[38:10] know Jesus Christ that's all I all I
[38:12] want to know is him
[38:15] now we find that we got it it certainly
[38:17] has to bring to pass the prophecy of
[38:19] second Timothy 3 or there be lukewarm
[38:22] you know heady high-minded lovers of
[38:24] pleasure more than of God truce Breakers
[38:26] the incontinent and Fierce and despisers
[38:30] those that are good
[38:32] what has it done to us
[38:34] it's almost made our Pentecostal women
[38:38] uh Hollywood Showmanship
[38:42] that's right
[38:44] it used to be wrong to go to the movies
[38:47] the bicycle
[38:49] but now you know the devil just beat him
[38:52] to that he put it right in the house
[38:56] that's right
[38:58] it used to be wrong to do it used to be
[39:00] wrong for our sisters to cut the hair or
[39:02] wear short dresses
[39:04] but now it isn't
[39:07] not in the Pentecostal way of thinking
[39:10] in their organization but is still wrong
[39:13] by God's word
[39:17] but you see they got their their their
[39:19] their power bobbed off see and then they
[39:24] say well our church be I don't care
[39:26] what's your church believes is what God
[39:27] Said
[39:28] that's the reason she stands today
[39:30] without the answer
[39:32] that's exactly the way a Samson student
[39:36] Samson was the same thing
[39:39] he must have thought of his heirs as he
[39:42] stood there I don't believe a man could
[39:43] stand there and think since but what
[39:45] could think knowing here he is now he's
[39:47] just become a a stamina
[39:50] what a condition
[39:52] great big man stand there all the man
[39:57] that ever was in him as far as what I
[39:59] call muscles every one of them is there
[40:02] he still had his muscles he still had
[40:04] his big muscles his biceps he had he had
[40:07] a great big Fists he still probably was
[40:10] just as big as he ever was frankly the
[40:13] Pentecostal church is a lot bigger than
[40:15] it ever was
[40:18] but where was God
[40:20] that's him
[40:23] yes
[40:24] As you stood there remember his errors
[40:28] he remembered what caused it first
[40:31] what caused it first was not exactly his
[40:34] natural eyes put out but it was his
[40:37] spiritual side put out
[40:39] that he let
[40:42] Delilah woo him into it and that's
[40:46] what's hindered the church today is the
[40:49] spiritual Insight of the word of God has
[40:52] been swapped for a bunch of creeds
[40:56] that's the odd the devil is first thing
[40:59] he can do is put your eyes up
[41:02] tell you it's a bunch of Holy Rollers
[41:04] tell you it's this side or the other or
[41:06] some Devil's move or it's a mental
[41:08] telepathy or something on that order if
[41:11] he can punch your eyes out you're in
[41:13] darkness
[41:15] the Lord is Samson's first plea in his
[41:18] prayer Lord that I might have binged my
[41:20] two eyes
[41:21] he knew there's where his trouble come
[41:24] notice
[41:26] his locks had grown out
[41:29] but he was blind
[41:33] he'd have to stagger all the rest of his
[41:35] days he was blind
[41:38] we may have as big a Machinery as we
[41:40] ever had as many members
[41:42] but what good does it do if you're blind
[41:45] to the very thing that's going on in
[41:47] front of and you can't see it
[41:50] what's happening right here day by day
[41:52] along with the people of the Holy Spirit
[41:54] revealing himself and people don't see
[41:56] it that's blind
[41:59] spiritual blind
[42:00] they stood and watched Jesus perform
[42:02] Miracles and so forth and declare
[42:04] himself to be the Messiah
[42:06] and they couldn't see it he said they
[42:08] got us but they can't see they were
[42:10] blind and Samson was blind
[42:14] but here's what Samson recognized that
[42:16] the church has never come to you yet
[42:19] he knew there was a possibility
[42:23] of coming back again
[42:25] if the church could only know that a
[42:27] possibility
[42:30] but the people of the day don't seem to
[42:32] catch the vision yet they don't seem to
[42:35] catch it that there is a possibility it
[42:37] doesn't come through you shout a little
[42:39] more
[42:40] Pat your hands a little more or dance a
[42:42] little more that isn't it
[42:44] no it's back to the word there's a
[42:47] possibility of coming back and getting
[42:49] the word on the inside again
[42:51] you bypassed it there
[42:53] notice they sit tight oh sure clap their
[42:58] hands yes sir but you see that's all
[43:00] sales without any anchor
[43:04] I've seen the heathens clapped their
[43:06] hands
[43:07] do a dance
[43:08] speak in tongues
[43:10] and do all those things and interpret it
[43:12] but they were African heathens
[43:16] sure I see them lay a pencil down
[43:20] and that Witch Doctor stood there and
[43:22] made that pencil stand up and it went up
[43:24] and down on a place up there and come
[43:25] back and played like shaved a Haircut
[43:27] Two Bits
[43:29] and draw out an unknown tongue
[43:33] and wrote it out and one of them stood
[43:35] there interpreted him
[43:38] oh my
[43:40] God you can't rely on that
[43:43] many of them speak in tongues and they
[43:47] deny the very principles of Jesus Christ
[43:54] I've took my Bible laid it right out to
[43:57] me and him standing there speaking in
[43:58] tongues and I said brother this is
[44:00] exactly I don't even want to see a glory
[44:02] to God I don't know what Jesus said I
[44:03] don't care about the rest of it
[44:04] Hallelujah glory to God like that why a
[44:06] man that would turn his back upon truth
[44:08] and actually put on a shindig like that
[44:12] to keep from seeing the truth that's
[44:14] hypocrisy
[44:17] and the heights of it just because he'd
[44:21] have to give up his Fellowship card if
[44:22] he accepted what was truth
[44:26] that's worse than Samson notice
[44:30] but they didn't catch it they set tight
[44:33] now oh sure we have great getting
[44:36] togethers meetings we call it worldly uh
[44:39] revivals and so forth all full of tinsel
[44:42] not sure great big things and great
[44:45] advertisement a man with the message of
[44:47] the hour and so and so and so and so we
[44:49] have all of that but where's God
[44:52] that's the thing we're looking for where
[44:54] it's gone a great big piece of scholarly
[44:57] Showmanship somebody with enough
[44:59] education that wouldn't uh use the word
[45:02] uh half the people could understand what
[45:05] he was saying and yet he's got an
[45:07] honorary degree and a degree and a
[45:09] degree and a degree and he can
[45:11] lectionary and put the words together
[45:12] and stand so perfectly straight and say
[45:15] ah man just exactly right and turn like
[45:17] a military man walk off the platform but
[45:19] where is God
[45:26] Samson
[45:29] had stood in that place one time himself
[45:32] and knowed the power of God but now he
[45:35] had been shaving of those privileges
[45:39] he was just as big as he ever was but
[45:41] God wasn't there
[45:43] we got a lot of that today it's too bad
[45:46] that we have it but we have it now we
[45:48] notice
[45:49] but it don't bring back the spirit of
[45:51] God
[45:52] now the thing of it is the people are
[45:55] not willing to pay the price to get back
[45:58] to that I believe that God just Remains
[46:01] the Same as he ever was
[46:04] but the thing of it is that people has
[46:07] got so wound up into the world and the
[46:09] world in them so they just got just
[46:12] enough religion to make them miserable
[46:15] not enough to really turn loose to God
[46:18] and give your whole heart into him
[46:21] now I'll go to church certainly I enjoy
[46:24] good singing clapping hands yeah I love
[46:27] that see but when he comes right down to
[46:29] putting what you say you believe into
[46:32] practice
[46:33] and wouldn't you confess the wrong they
[46:36] don't do it
[46:38] it just isn't there they don't have it
[46:40] well that's real conviction
[46:43] that's what we need we've long left that
[46:46] a long time ago it has swapped it prayer
[46:49] and and confession and conviction we
[46:53] swapped it for emotion
[46:55] a shaken or a jerking or jumping up and
[46:58] down that's the reason there's no
[47:00] holding tight because there's nothing
[47:01] there to hold them
[47:04] until you come up on the basis of God's
[47:07] word of Godly sorrow ready to repent and
[47:11] make anything right and do what's right
[47:13] ready to live right I don't care what
[47:15] the people say or anything else you live
[47:17] for yours for Jesus Christ and what he
[47:19] said
[47:20] then you take a church like that coming
[47:22] back there's a possibility of it coming
[47:25] but they're not willing to do it Sampson
[47:28] prayed a lot right Lord
[47:30] let me die with this listings oh my
[47:35] see let's go to costume what if God
[47:36] answers his prayer
[47:38] let me down
[47:41] oh I like that was it Patrick Henry said
[47:43] Give me liberty give me that John all
[47:46] right that's it Liberty or death
[47:50] it's back to God or our death
[47:55] what are we going to do what are we
[47:57] mimicking what are we trying to play
[47:59] Christianity
[48:00] if the Holy Ghost is still the holy
[48:03] ghost that fell at Pentecost it still
[48:05] does the same things it did then the
[48:07] same power The Same Spirit it'll work
[48:09] the same way
[48:12] we don't need a council of churches
[48:15] we need the Bible back in action it's
[48:18] exactly
[48:19] now we find out that Sampson prayed
[48:23] right Lord let me die with the Enemy
[48:28] die to the enemy that got him in that
[48:31] way
[48:32] if there's anything that people ought to
[48:34] pray for tonight and we see the thing
[48:36] that's done this
[48:37] is getting away from the Bible to a
[48:40] Creed
[48:42] then die with the things get out get out
[48:45] of it
[48:46] to it
[48:51] Samson was willing to pay the price to
[48:53] get the power of God back again there's
[48:56] a price to be paid for it but uh today
[48:59] the people don't seem to all we hear
[49:01] Revival sure yes we have a
[49:04] denominational Revival get more members
[49:06] in and things like that but look at the
[49:08] morals it's constantly decaying
[49:11] look how further and further away from
[49:13] God they're getting all the time getting
[49:15] away from the word and now when they go
[49:17] in and come into the Council of churches
[49:20] while they'd accepted the biggest killer
[49:22] that the church word has got the word
[49:25] that God left to him they bypass all of
[49:28] that
[49:28] you can't teach that Bible you got to
[49:30] teach their Creed
[49:33] there it is
[49:35] Samson know one thing and I wonder if
[49:37] the church realizes today
[49:40] he knew that his back-slidden condition
[49:43] couldn't meet the challenge of the hour
[49:47] and I know today that the backslidden
[49:49] condition of the church can't meet the
[49:51] challenge of this hour
[49:54] and it's going to be worse
[49:59] the Bible said as janvis and jambers
[50:02] withstood Moses
[50:04] so will they never reprobate mine
[50:08] concerning the faith
[50:11] they can almost impersonate it exactly
[50:16] Moses went out with a his command from
[50:19] God with a stick in his hand and God
[50:22] said do this sign before them if they
[50:25] won't listen to that then do this sign
[50:26] before them and if you won't listen to
[50:29] that then I'll be with you I'll take
[50:31] care of the rest of it well Moses went
[50:33] down with his first sign and as soon as
[50:35] he performed his first sign there's
[50:37] impersonators everywhere doing the same
[50:39] thing
[50:41] but Moses never fussed about it
[50:44] he just stood still for he knew that it
[50:48] was God that sent him
[50:51] we're going to have that repeat again in
[50:53] the last days remember
[50:56] and our backslidden state now will not
[50:59] meet the challenge of the hour
[51:01] yet all the big frames here there's more
[51:03] Pentecostals in the world today than
[51:05] there ever was if we know of them more
[51:07] Pentecostal Believers that's right you
[51:10] know what a Sunday visitor the Catholic
[51:13] paper Sunday paper called the Sunday
[51:15] visitor I believe about two years ago
[51:17] made some kind of a statement like this
[51:19] he said the fastest growing Church in
[51:22] the world is the Pentecostals
[51:24] so last year the Catholic Church uh
[51:28] recorded a million conversions to
[51:31] Catholicism but said the that's all
[51:33] Catholicism but said the Pentecostal
[51:36] Church alone in itself recorded one
[51:39] million five hundred thousand
[51:42] now the frame is there
[51:45] but we don't have the power we had when
[51:47] we were a handful
[51:51] all the Samson's big books stood there
[51:53] but where was the power of the Lord
[51:58] yes the denominational system don't
[52:01] vindicate the word of the Lord that's
[52:04] right
[52:05] now notice
[52:07] I was talking to a priest that lives out
[52:10] the lane from me the Sacred Heart Church
[52:13] about a month ago since this new issues
[52:16] come on the Lutheran preacher
[52:19] had the priest of the Catholic Church
[52:21] Sacred Heart Church up to preaching his
[52:24] Pulpit for him
[52:26] and the the Catholic priest had the
[52:30] Lutheran Minister down the same ass for
[52:33] him
[52:35] swapping Pulpit big piece of paper
[52:38] sure
[52:39] oh my
[52:41] if anybody could see that
[52:43] and not if you can't understand that
[52:46] well you're you're certainly
[52:47] scripturally blind
[52:49] yes
[52:51] I've talked to this priest
[52:53] and he said to me he said the I want to
[52:56] talk to you
[52:58] uh Miss Brandon I said all right and he
[53:01] said did you baptize uh this uh Fraser
[53:05] girl the name of Mary Elizabeth Frazier
[53:07] I said yes sir I did he said the bishop
[53:10] wants your signed statement about it
[53:13] I said I understand that she turned
[53:17] Catholic he said yes that she'd come
[53:19] back to the mother Church
[53:21] and I said yes sir I said her mother was
[53:23] telling me about said yes her mother
[53:24] didn't take it too well I said her
[53:26] mother told me she'd rather walk with
[53:28] her to the Grave
[53:29] and I said frankly that's what she's
[53:31] doing and so he said um
[53:34] he said I want you to sign this
[53:35] statement said did you baptize her uh
[53:39] how did you baptize her I said a
[53:41] Christian baptism
[53:43] and he said I mean how sir did you uh
[53:47] sprinkler poor or immerse her I said
[53:49] Christian baptism is immersing
[53:51] uh-huh so all right so now you a you
[53:55] immersed her then in the name of the
[53:57] father son Holy Ghost I said yes sir
[53:59] that's Jesus Christ that's the name of
[54:00] the father son Holy Ghost that's why I
[54:02] baptized and uh he said you baptized her
[54:05] in the name of the father son oh God
[54:06] says yes sir I never called them words
[54:07] now I baptize her in the name of the
[54:10] father Son and Holy Ghost which is Jesus
[54:11] Christ
[54:13] he said yes sir I see and he put it down
[54:15] like that he said you know that's the
[54:17] way uh uh the early Catholic Church
[54:20] baptized him I said oh is that right and
[54:22] he said yeah that's where I said what
[54:23] happened he did run well and he said
[54:25] well he said you see said said you
[54:27] believe a Bible God is in his church I
[54:30] said God is in his word sir his word I
[54:32] said did you say Peter was the first
[54:34] pope he said he was
[54:36] well I said then if the Catholic church
[54:38] has to say all of its masses and and
[54:40] Latin and so forth where it won't change
[54:42] then what did the first pope said in
[54:44] Acts 2 38 where he said repent be
[54:46] baptized everyone in the name of Jesus
[54:47] Christ for the mission of sins
[54:51] he said if you I said on this confession
[54:54] and so forth I said he said well didn't
[54:57] Jesus tell his disciples whosoever sins
[54:59] you remit to them they're remitted
[55:01] whosoever sins you retain to them
[55:03] they're retained I said he did then
[55:05] what's wrong with that your very Bible
[55:06] tells you that I said then if you'll
[55:08] remit sins the way that they remitted
[55:10] them I'll go with him so as Peter was
[55:12] asked someone that had the keys what
[55:14] must we do to be saved he said repent
[55:16] every one of you and be baptized in the
[55:18] name of Jesus Christ
[55:22] oh you do it like that and I'll go with
[55:24] you
[55:25] hey man
[55:27] that's the word that's God's way of
[55:30] doing
[55:33] a weaken on him
[55:34] that's he said brother uh when I come to
[55:38] argue with you I said who was arguing
[55:41] I said I never I'm not arguing I you
[55:44] just asked me a question now I answered
[55:46] it the best of the Lord how I said I'm
[55:47] going to ask you one
[55:49] I said you said that the that God was
[55:52] with the church and now I'm going to
[55:55] give you the benefit of telling you the
[55:57] first Christians if you want to call
[55:58] them Catholic all right Peter James John
[56:00] Mark Loop and all them they yes I said
[56:03] then in following the order of the Bible
[56:06] that these Apostles wrote now you mean
[56:10] today that you're a diocese now is so
[56:13] much greater than it was than you no
[56:15] more wisdom and you know how to take
[56:17] care of the yes sir that's exactly right
[56:19] I said then why was it that when they
[56:22] followed the commandments of Jesus
[56:24] Christ they raised the dead they cast
[56:26] out Devils they've done all kinds of
[56:28] signs and wonders and you don't do it
[56:29] today
[56:31] now what's wrong
[56:34] if the church was better in the Lutheran
[56:36] age or the Western age or any other age
[56:38] than it was back there why didn't they
[56:40] do the works of them then
[56:43] certainly
[56:44] back to the word Samson stood there
[56:47] stripped of his power
[56:50] but you know there was something I want
[56:52] to hurry
[56:53] the Philistines didn't notice while
[56:55] Samson is down there thinking all this
[56:56] over
[56:57] I wished I could take the Pentecostal
[56:59] world and back them up in a corner
[57:01] somewhere let them think like that for a
[57:02] while
[57:04] just think these reasonable things where
[57:07] are we now with our great big book of
[57:09] organization everyone against the other
[57:12] one the Oneness against the Tunis the
[57:14] two-ness against the threeness and so
[57:16] forth all yes that's the way it is
[57:18] it shouldn't be that way
[57:21] shouldn't be that way we should come
[57:23] back and come together and settle it up
[57:25] on the basis of thus saith the Lord
[57:28] what's the matter with the prophets in
[57:30] the church the word of the Lord's
[57:32] supposed to come to the prophets
[57:35] if a prophet that claims to be a prophet
[57:38] and will deny this truth in the Bible
[57:41] according to the word he's not a prophet
[57:46] now we're supposed to have these gifts
[57:49] to set us an order
[57:51] keep us in order
[57:53] but somehow another we got away from it
[57:56] all and they stand backed in the corner
[57:59] and you're stood Samson standing in the
[58:01] corner thinking of all that had been and
[58:05] these Philistines stand out there with
[58:06] their arms around these women looking
[58:08] down belching and drunk and celebrating
[58:13] the victory over Jehovah servant oh my
[58:18] don't let that just send something
[58:19] through you to think of that a victory
[58:21] over Jehovah's plan
[58:24] yes standing there with a fish God
[58:27] Dagan was a fish God
[58:29] and there was burning sacrifice human
[58:31] lives were taken
[58:32] a little child had to die for the
[58:34] sacrifice run a sword through it this
[58:37] heart for the sacrifice
[58:40] and there they were having this big
[58:42] celebration over the victory
[58:45] over Jehovah
[58:47] and the church side like a bunch of
[58:50] Philistines is growth and over the idea
[58:53] that a council of churches after a while
[58:56] will shut out every church that don't
[58:57] belong to it
[58:59] Samson don't never Bob your hair
[59:03] stay right with that word I don't care
[59:06] what happens you stay right there
[59:08] that word
[59:10] don't get mixed up in that Samson began
[59:13] to think
[59:14] wonder if there's a possibility
[59:17] now I said I know my hair's got out but
[59:19] I'm blind
[59:21] there could be a possibility of another
[59:23] Revival there's a possibility he said to
[59:26] the little boy
[59:27] [Music]
[59:28] um
[59:29] uh pop my hands up on the post
[59:32] is he's the post that the whole
[59:34] building's passing on yes and you say
[59:37] all the kings and celebrities up on top
[59:40] yes I'm tired uh you've had to do made
[59:44] me do so many tricks and things well you
[59:46] just put my hands up on the post and he
[59:49] put his hands up on the post and stood
[59:51] in between him maybe like in this order
[59:54] and he stood there in his hands against
[59:55] the post the Philistines celebrating and
[59:59] having such a big time they forgot to
[1:00:01] watch him
[1:00:03] oh my
[1:00:05] God but he began to think
[1:00:08] God's still God
[1:00:10] I know he is I've tried him I put him to
[1:00:14] the test
[1:00:16] I know He Still Remains God it's me
[1:00:18] that's wrong
[1:00:19] I'm the one that sinned
[1:00:22] they didn't notice the tears running out
[1:00:24] of that blinded sockets
[1:00:26] dripping out off of his chin
[1:00:29] they noticed his lips are moving Lord
[1:00:33] I've done wrong let me die with the
[1:00:36] Philistines
[1:00:38] he wanted God's word manifested before
[1:00:43] that Jezebel more than he wanted his own
[1:00:45] life
[1:00:46] all that desire to come to the church
[1:00:48] again
[1:00:51] he wasn't praying for new order new
[1:00:53] denomination but that the word of God
[1:00:56] might be made known again the promise
[1:00:58] that he once had might come back to him
[1:01:00] again he was aware of what would happen
[1:01:02] if his prayer was answered but he was
[1:01:05] ready and in a dead Earnest or if the
[1:01:08] church could only get like that
[1:01:10] then he cried out
[1:01:12] slowly he was praying it's possible Lord
[1:01:16] it is possible to stand here all my big
[1:01:19] frames still together I'm here my hairs
[1:01:22] go down but I couldn't see how to whip
[1:01:24] him no more because my eyes is blind I
[1:01:26] couldn't see where I was going but it's
[1:01:29] possibly that you let it happen again
[1:01:31] Lord to show your power he screamed out
[1:01:34] once more Lord just want some more
[1:01:40] or the church could only cry that
[1:01:43] once more Lord let us see your power
[1:01:47] once more and as he cried and asked God
[1:01:52] I can see them muscles begin to swell
[1:01:55] ever fiber in his body begin to twist
[1:01:58] the Holy Ghost is coming up on me man
[1:02:01] stretch forth his hands again with the
[1:02:03] power of the Holy Ghost upon him down
[1:02:06] with the building
[1:02:08] the Bible said he killed more that day
[1:02:11] than he did all the rest of his days he
[1:02:14] fulfilled a commission God gave him then
[1:02:17] once more it's always been that way when
[1:02:20] the power of God comes the big
[1:02:22] structures of ism's fall
[1:02:25] Samson's greatest victory over his enemy
[1:02:28] was at his end times
[1:02:30] now let me say this just in closing
[1:02:33] Pentecost can we stand at the post of
[1:02:37] these big organizations can we stand at
[1:02:40] the post of Hollywood
[1:02:43] and all these other things that separate
[1:02:45] us from the love of God that's in Christ
[1:02:48] and can we stand there and repent and
[1:02:51] cry aloud again Lord once more make us
[1:02:56] Pentecost
[1:02:57] once more Lord once more make us
[1:03:01] Pentacles once more show your power unto
[1:03:04] us Lord just once more listen
[1:03:08] destroy your enemy before your enemy
[1:03:11] destroys you
[1:03:13] 'll do it bring back the old-fashioned
[1:03:16] meetings and the thing and oh leave
[1:03:20] Delilah alone leave the world alone that
[1:03:24] thing that Woos you off into little
[1:03:26] things that you shouldn't little things
[1:03:28] troubles come up in the church and you
[1:03:30] won't stay in correction because you
[1:03:31] don't have to you could drop off to
[1:03:32] another church and things like that in
[1:03:34] the early days when a man didn't cope up
[1:03:36] with the word of God they packed him out
[1:03:38] dead
[1:03:40] bring us back to Pentecost
[1:03:45] not Hollywood Showmanship but a
[1:03:47] wholehearted turn to God is what we need
[1:03:51] once more oh Lord once more
[1:03:56] if I could see that happen
[1:03:59] if my old weakening eyes
[1:04:03] could look again and see that church
[1:04:06] forget its differences
[1:04:08] if I could see that denominational
[1:04:10] system break down their throat right
[1:04:12] into the lap of the council and say we
[1:04:13] want nothing to do it we'll not far for
[1:04:16] our birthrights
[1:04:18] if I could see the Trinity and Oneness
[1:04:20] and all of them get together and say
[1:04:21] brethren
[1:04:22] look back to where we left him off at
[1:04:25] let's go back to where we started
[1:04:28] fussing one another at right back up on
[1:04:30] the subject of water baptism and come
[1:04:32] right back and take the Bible Way part
[1:04:34] and then cry once more Lord once more
[1:04:38] and get all of this Showmanship and a
[1:04:42] lot of these fellas up on the platform
[1:04:44] in the knows some more about God than a
[1:04:46] rabbit does about snowshoes and these
[1:04:49] women with dresses so tight to their
[1:04:51] skins on the outside walking up and down
[1:04:53] a platform clapping their hands and
[1:04:55] jumping around like that like a bunch of
[1:04:57] show or something other God bring us
[1:04:59] back to the Holy Ghost in power in the
[1:05:02] manifestation of the word
[1:05:06] once more Lord once more
[1:05:13] be a believer
[1:05:15] Lord God once more
[1:05:17] once more let me see the presence of
[1:05:20] Jesus Christ walking through the church
[1:05:23] let me see his power and his promise
[1:05:25] made manifest before us
[1:05:27] once more Lord once more
[1:05:32] God be merciful help us
[1:05:35] see what these other things gets us it
[1:05:37] kills a very uh it drives away the
[1:05:40] nature of Christ out of the congregation
[1:05:42] out of the out of the church out away
[1:05:45] from the people we should be so woven
[1:05:48] together that there be nothing separate
[1:05:50] us from this word and our love for one
[1:05:52] another
[1:05:54] Jesus Christ is here
[1:05:55] he's our father
[1:05:57] he's our mother he's my healer he he's
[1:06:01] my king he's my God he's my alive he's
[1:06:05] my joy he's my peace oh that there is he
[1:06:09] is for me he's My All In All
[1:06:13] he's here now
[1:06:15] he wants to bring the church back to
[1:06:17] that place wonder if we could cry once
[1:06:20] more Lord and let the the tears of
[1:06:24] repentance drop from our blinded sockets
[1:06:28] I'm not exactly talking to this church
[1:06:30] this is tape you see here this go around
[1:06:32] the world
[1:06:34] let our let our people come back to that
[1:06:37] again
[1:06:38] let it come back to a place where we
[1:06:40] could call back a meeting like we used
[1:06:43] to have
[1:06:44] just even take 10 or 15 years back look
[1:06:46] how it's declined since then
[1:06:49] look how it's went down down down
[1:06:52] it's got so it's almost a shame of
[1:06:54] fellow feels embarrassed almost to talk
[1:06:56] about Divine Healing you've been so much
[1:06:58] reproach brought upon him
[1:07:00] talk about the Holy Ghost when so much
[1:07:02] reproach has been brought upon him
[1:07:04] that's right it's not God's fault it's a
[1:07:08] Samson
[1:07:09] that has left
[1:07:11] all the principles of God's word and has
[1:07:15] substituted something else and let the
[1:07:16] organization shade him down
[1:07:19] moving into it
[1:07:21] I say to you my brother sister if I
[1:07:23] never seen or this side of the of the
[1:07:26] great judgment bar of God Jesus Christ
[1:07:28] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:31] his word to me is life he's here now
[1:07:36] you believe that
[1:07:38] I know you sure
[1:07:42] and the only thing you have to do to
[1:07:44] know and share is get yourself out of
[1:07:46] the way
[1:07:48] as long as you're in the way then God
[1:07:51] cannot do nothing for you
[1:07:53] when you think your thoughts then God's
[1:07:56] thoughts don't have a chance
[1:07:58] but if you quit thinking your thoughts
[1:08:00] and think his thoughts
[1:08:03] my thoughts is not your thoughts he said
[1:08:05] if there'd be any praise if there be any
[1:08:07] virtue think on these things
[1:08:11] not what some church is going to say
[1:08:12] about it but what God said about it
[1:08:17] like this little lady laying here
[1:08:18] shaking and this God that woman's gonna
[1:08:20] lay like that all of her life
[1:08:22] unless she can get her her face set
[1:08:25] right straight on Jesus Christ
[1:08:27] and no matter what comes or goes if he
[1:08:30] revealed to her then there's nothing
[1:08:32] going to stop the healing
[1:08:34] that's right
[1:08:38] but when you get your depends on what
[1:08:40] you're thinking about
[1:08:41] if you just believe and have faith
[1:08:44] God can do anything for you and the
[1:08:46] greatest thing he can do for you tonight
[1:08:47] is sweep your soul right back into the
[1:08:49] presence of his being
[1:08:51] right back there to where every person
[1:08:54] in here just think what if the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost had everybody in here completely
[1:08:58] in his control
[1:09:01] think of what would take place today
[1:09:03] think what would take place in
[1:09:05] Shreveport by this time tomorrow night
[1:09:07] they have headlines everywhere
[1:09:10] a bunch of people went crazy
[1:09:13] they were Healing The Sick and raising
[1:09:15] the dead and doing all kinds of things
[1:09:16] down in Shreveport Louisiana United
[1:09:18] States USA
[1:09:20] that have it on television
[1:09:22] or whatever's doing if the Holy Ghost
[1:09:25] could take completely control why don't
[1:09:27] he he wants to he's willing to he's
[1:09:30] waiting well you say I've asked him so
[1:09:33] many things I just hate to ask him too
[1:09:35] much ask the abundance that your Joys
[1:09:38] might be full
[1:09:39] could you imagine a little fish a half
[1:09:42] inch long out in the middle of the
[1:09:43] Pacific sand I better drink of this
[1:09:45] water sparingly I might run out someday
[1:09:49] could you think of a little mouse about
[1:09:50] that vegan the great Garners of Egypt

[1:09:54] day of course I might run out for the
[1:09:56] next Harvest comes in oh no now divide
[1:09:59] that by 100 billion and that's how easy
[1:10:02] you can exhaust God's mercies and Grace
[1:10:05] and power to you if you just believe it
[1:10:09] you can just leave yourself out I'm
[1:10:10] sorry uh
[1:10:12] that's you can't exhaust him he's the
[1:10:15] inexhaustible Fountain of eternal life
[1:10:19] here tonight to make manifested any
[1:10:22] Divine promise of his Bible
