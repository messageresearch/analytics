this morning we know you're the only one we can't do it on our own this morning we require your help this morning father as we come before you the prayers have been prayed the faith is high in the building this morning and I believe that there is no devil that can stand this morning in this presence there is no weapon in this in this building I believe in any Corner that can stand against father this presence and Lord if we can just come and we can just allow ourselves Lord to just come under this word father right now Lord I ask Lord that every heart would be surrendered now to this Lord to this word Lord God I can't do this on my own Lord I ask that you would just speak through me now father as these words of life would come forth Lord in every heart that is here Lord you know exactly what they need what they've been facing Lord what they've been going through every family situation father every every hereditary thing Lord every generational curse every situation what they're going to face next week Lord Lord as long as you should carry father and right now in this very moment though it could be a tradition a religion right in this moment in this day it could change if we would just come under this word and I pray God that we would do it now help me father to come under it myself we thank you Father for this opportunity Lord we ask that you would bless every heart bless the the our pastor father as he is Father away Lord dur during this situ ation pray for healing and strength Lord God in each and every one father the service that they're doing now Lord we just thank you we love you we praise you in Jesus name amen are you happy this morning you love the Lord amen let's sing one more chor key of D this morning um hallelujah oh can't you see why I happy are you really happy oh I've accepted the word of the [Music] Lord word that [Music] was of for sing it one more time now oh can't you see oh why I'm so happy oh I accepted the word of Lord the word that was Spen by the Propet [Music] of Hallelujah while you're standing let's open our Bibles to the book of Ephesians chapter 5 it's good to be back here with you this morning Amen to see some familiar faces some unfamiliar faces but we're all familiar in the word of God Amen one of these glorious days will never depart amen how many's longing for that day amen I just to get out of this uh as I will say this godforsaken world Amen and we're longing for that day but until then let's press on Amen let's press on and it's uh such a privilege and we're thankful for the opportunity I guess we did not come under the radar as or under the wind whatever whatever however Brother David said it uh but we're just glad to be here amen Ephesians chapter 5 verse number 22 we trust that this morning we would be able to say something that would encourage you along the way says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject or yielded or obedient unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word you thankful for that word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle which is flaw or any such thing so there's nothing going to be in this but that it should be holy and without blemish amen God bless you you can be seated this morning as we look into this scripture this is kind of a foundational scripture to our thought this morning our thought would be a charge to clear the land a charge to clear the land now I I want to take one word here just real quick in verse 27 that he might present so the word present uh however you would want to say it in the Greek uh parisy or pisty which is to bring into one's fellowship or into iny that he might present it to himself so his desire is to bring into fellowship or an an intimate relationship so he is wanting to bring you not into such as a religion or into a uh just an idea that he might present it to himself a glorious church so if we can build a foundation on this one of my favorite and and I hate to use the word favorite my goodness it's a human human word because there is not such a thing as a favorite but I will just say an exciting quote for me as of right now I just I build upon this so much is in Christ is the mystery of God paragraph 240 says the new birth is Christ is a revelation says God has revealed to you now you have to accept this for yourself this great mystery so thus it's no longer a mystery to you and that's a new birth birth says now what are you going to do now think about this what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word Capital word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest now think about it it's not so it's not just saying this group and that group and that group but we're talking about the entirety as a whole what are we going to do okay when this comes together now now think about what's what he's building up to here the same thing that he did making the word manifest and here it is oh if the church now we know what he's speaking of here only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it when what it the church the bride knows what it is now think of the profoundness of this thought yet in its Simplicity you say me you now you have to take this for yourself the church or the bride must know your position you must know your position so in in a sense this is simple you've got to understand and your position so in reality two things should happen two things getting into and knowing are you still with me so number one getting into which is expressing a change of circumstance so this is an action on a person's part so you have something that you've got to do all right so getting into so this is an action on your part number two is knowing so a knowing is showing or suggesting that one has knowledge or awareness that is secret or known to only a few people having intelligence or keenly alert now when you think of intelligence what type of intelligence are you thinking of I don't want you to just think of the intellig of the mind I want you to think of the intelligence of the intelligence of the army the intelligence that you know of the enemy I've got Intel so again you're getting into a position and you know something about something that no one else knows so you are getting into a position and you're getting into an action so God is calling a church search a bride into an action and by you getting into action now you are getting Intel by coming into action now okay we're building into something so let's build to this now in the scripture and your life you have to adhere to his word and it is an utmost importance right now the primary issue contributing to widespread human failure appears to a lack of follow through we all desire to follow through we go to church we hear the word come forth you're sitting here this morning you perhaps sat here Wednesday night you heard the word come forth God spoke to your heart and you said I I'm going to do it I'm not going to go back but it it appears to be that a lack of follow-through is the problem which stems from various challenges and struggles so when we begin to struggle we start off good but then when we begin to struggle we then start to compromise and with compromise comes idolatry and then with idolatry then comes weakness and then that weakness it becomes spiritual cancer then they become part of the family then it becomes our friends and it becomes our first go-to in times of trouble I'm trying to tell you what happens to our families you see we've been told to clear the land now let's back up let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 11 notice some of the parallels with today's warnings that we've just started with we've got a little bit of lengthy reading but in Every Family there's always a cancer there's always a cancer that tries to go through a family and I'm not speaking of body cancer I'm speaking of spiritual cancer and and a lot of times it becomes our friends it becomes our fallback and God wants us to eliminate it now perhaps you have the perfect family and you are the model wonderful so we want we want you to be the model of that that's great and we all H have at one time eliminated that generational curse none of us wants to think that we are uh you know that you know none of us wants to think that we're wrong but we also want to get our head out of the sand we also don't want to uh come down to the end of the road and realize that we left the cancer there do you realize that we're at the ending of this Gentile dispensation dispensation do you realize that we are coming to the end there is no more for us there is no more time so when it when it's over it's over okay I I want to I just want to ask make sure we're all on the same page here okay Deuteronomy 11:8 therefore shall ye keep all the commandments so there's no way around this right well brother Jeremy this is the Old Testament we're in the new just follow with me says which I command you this day I'm sorry Deuteronomy 11:8 that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whether ye go to possess it and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land that FL FL floweth with milk and honey for the land whether thou goest into possess it is not as the land of Egypt from whence ye came out where thou seest thy seed and waterest with thy foot as a garden of herbs but the land whether you go to possess it is a land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh water of the rain of Heaven A Land which the Lord thy God carth for the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it from the beginning of the year even un the end of the year and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my Commandments which I command you this day to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul that I will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain sewing and the latter harvesting come on the latter rain that thou mayest Gather in thy corn word and the wine Revelation and thine oil come on where's there's types in this and I will send grass in thy field for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived listen where do we hear this what did Jesus warn Us in the new what did he tell us don't be deceived be not deceived now what do you think about this word heart here this word heart is your inner thoughts and emotions don't let your inner thoughts and emotions be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them listen I'm giving you this land but don't be deceived there's going to be something there that's going to tempt you verse 17 and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heavens and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit lest ye perish uh uh quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul this is come on this is more than just outward appearance and bind them for a sign upon your hand now it's it's outside okay so we're inside and outside that they may be as frontlet between your eyes and you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou Rises up this is showing the importance of a Godly Family come on we don't want to get so caught up as parents in what we would say is a Godly work that we leave our kids Behind hello and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy Gates that your days be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of Heaven upon the Earth for if you diligently keep all these Commandments now I don't want to just skip over the word diligently that is care and dedication so if you take care and dedication to keep all of these Commandments which I command you to do them to love the Lord your God to walk in all the ways and to cleave unto him uh uh then will the Lord dry now notice this then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourself every PL now not we always we always skip to the every place where the souls of your feet shall tread right you with me we always get to that part but we forget the beginning part we got something we got to do church every place where on the soes of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even to the uttermost Sea shall your Coast be there shall how many believes the word come on we're trying to build a point here this morning there shall no man say it with me no man be able to stand before you I'm going to say this there's no Spirit there's no demon there's no sickness there is nothing that can stand before you do you believe it all right you said it Hallelujah behold oh I set before you this day a blessing and a cursing or and a curse a blessing if ye obey the Commandments of the Lord your God I'm sorry your God which I command you this day we got to read verse 28 and a curse if you will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known now I know that was lengthy but we we're Bible readers right so In this passage if you were following with me you will at least see five times the word possess five times it did not just say inhabit it said possess for it was not just about moving in but it was the word possess in the Hebrew this word possess means to drive out to seize to cast out to consume and to destroy this is not about you just grabbing your mom and pop and getting a U-Haul truck and going in and saying oh I want this house and moving in and inhabiting no this is about you grabbing your family grabbing all the weapons I don't this is not really good talk in this day and age but destroying and possessing are you still here this is seizing this is casting out this is consuming and this is destroying I believe this is why the lord gave our Prophet the idea or the thought footsteps footsteps meant possession because this is more than inhabiting think about this in perseverance in 63 he says you fight for every inch of the way well I thought that if I went to The Altar and I confessed my sins that if I walked out everything would just be A- okay and I would not have any more problems again who told you that is it definitely didn't come from the Bible hello no no you are going to fight every inch of the ways God down in Egypt give Palestine to the Jews but they fought every inch of the way God told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet rest that have I given you footsteps meant Victory possession and just as far as you can climb into the kingdom of God if you just want to climb a little piece and say well I believe I might not have to go to hell but I believe that I'll be saved at the end if I join a church you ain't got much ground yet but every promise in the Bible is yours you see but you'll have to fight every devil guard away from it with a two-edged sword and claim it for yourself be persistent walking right into it so this is something that's going to take persistence and fighting now think about it I know you but since I'm up here I already forgot your name but if you walked what what's your name brother Ben stand up here for me I like him he's a good guy now I like him because I believe he stands on the word of God and he's human just like I am but I'm going to use him this morning because I know him and I know he won't get mad at me if this guy walked into you know because I believe he he's got this build to be a sports guy but if he if he right now put on a sports uniform let's say he put on the Cowboys uniform this morning every Sunday he put on a Cowboys uniform and he walked into the stadium every Sunday does that make him a Cowboys player no sir why not he put it on the uniform and I'm not just talking about a fan uniform he puts on the whole Garb he walks in there and he goes in he says I'm a cowboy I'm a cowboy now some of y'all probably don't know what that means okay I'm just kidding does that make him that sir am I making any sense all right thank you I'm going to say that again does walking in with the full garb make you well see showing up to church every Sunday morning that preach is the prophet's message wearing the uniform doesn't make you a message believer I'm not here to disappoint you but there's got to be some work done I'm not here to discourage you don't get mad at me this is something I want to tell you you've got some work that you need to do you can't just come here this morning or every morning that your pastor preaches and say well at least I'm here I know that I I I believe that God sent a listen believing God sent a prophet ain't going to get you there there was a lot of people that followed Moses that didn't make it there was a lot of people that followed Joshua that didn't make it hello there was a lot of people that followed David listen there were people that followed Jesus that didn't make it Hallelujah some Works got to be done but it's not just about how eloquent we are how how well we can quote the word how eloquent we can quote the message how our message lingo is how much theology or even how excited we can become notice what he says here in Christ is the mystery says God is known by Simplicity and of revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth if you have been coming here and you're not born again something's wrong and it's not the pastor's fault it's not the evangelist's fault it's not the Deacon's fault it's not the worships fault hello come on it's nobody's fault but your own I don't know if you know that there's a song like that nobody's fault but your own I might not get called back again hello no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ the new birth he's born he borns in there and he injects his own life here it is and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminence is to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it's not even called to at all Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding see now catch what he says here by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery listen that's my that that that's why my heart is breaking of the mockery of the message leave this message alone let's come back to the Simplicity of the word so much division Among Us is because people let Lord come back I don't want to lack Revelation oh open up your word to me people lack that Revelation see they lack it the teachers notice so we have to have something in our life well bless God I've been going to church for 25 years and I've got this and I got a family listen I I don't see God keeps taking me back to something so I feel like I got to say this I don't let's say I'm a parent and I'm raising up a family what if God brother Billy uses me to bring my son into the message but I don't make it I don't want to be satisfied with just being a church member how many people are going to come up to the end of the road and be shocked and because they were content with just claiming God sent a prophet content with emotionalism content with theology we need to come back to the heart of the matter so back in this again this in Deuteronomy was given by the prophet Moses right then let's move to Joshua so it was given to Moses now to Joshua Joshua chap 1 verse 2 we find it says now Moses my servant is dead well I guess because he's dead I guess the word's over M now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you the word stays the same as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river euphra Ates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast here it is there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee same word same God same promise same commandment skip to verse 10 then Joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare ye victuals or Provisions for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan to go into possess the land which the Lord your God G giveth you to come on I don't think you're saying it not to just in habit the Lord has given you to possess it listen I want you to catch this this morning God did not bring you here to just inhabit a Pew he has brought you and given you a message to possess a message Revelation 10:9 says take it Revelation 10:10 says and I took this is an act of possessing so in this age there are possessors there are there will be a bride that will possess a message they're not satisfied brother Billy with coming to church and saying feed me but they want to come and they will stand upon a word and they will possess the word for themselves and they're not satisfied with Sunday morning possessing they're going to come Monday and Tuesday and they're going to possess the message for themselves they're hungry for the word of God oh Hallelujah there must be possessors today because inhabiters will not handle the pressure inhabiters will not be able to stand the pressure hallelujah how many believe that anything is possible for God I'm going to ask you again just in case you shut me down how many believe that anything is possible for God so nothing is impossible for God does that does that mean that there's nothing in your life that God cannot do for you all right well then let's go a little further in the in tement brother brandham says paragraph 60 God's word is eternal how many beli that as well if God's word is that perfect Hallelujah them who are in Christ is just as sure to raise as there is a resurrection Hallelujah ain't no devil in hell going to stop that God's just as obligated to his word to heal you as he is to save you it's his word that promised it it's God's word and we have no right to take away from it but just say it's the truth believe it no matter what happens believe it anyhow notice what he says here that's the way the rest of them had to believe it that's the way the rest of them I just read it that's all they had to do in Deuteronomy in Joshua that's all Israel had to do are you still with me that's all they had to do was believe it if they believed it everywhere the soles of their shoes was they possessed it there would have been no man able to stand before them there was nothing greater than them they would have been able to drive out every inhabit they would have been able to push and he said and we're not excluded from that God gave Palestine to Israel but they had to fight for every inch of ground God and the promise is yours but you have to fight for every inch you claim and the devil will see to that certainly he will but every claim in this word for our day is ours but we've been told don't mix it don't mix it notice what he says in in in a a a portion of a quote here and does God ever change his mind about his word said Israel was in their Journey going to Palestine coming from Egypt and the Lord was with them he said and every enemy that had raised up before Israel every enemy that had raised up before Israel was moved out of their way for God said he would send Hornets before them and would drive out every enemy as long long as they walked in obedience to his command the job was never too big the amalekites the Giants of the day meant nothing to Israel though they were small in stature but they were walking in thus saith the Lord listen if you stay in thus sayith the Lord nothing will stop you Hallelujah I didn't say you weren't going to face some troubles and trials and this flesh wasn't going to go through some hard times but stay and thus sayith the Lord and he'll get you through it I didn't say you weren't going to face some Giants in your life but stay and thus sayith the Lord and those giants will fall Allelujah so no matter what the opposition was God always seen that his words of promise never failed Israel so keep that in our mind keep that there there was nothing too hard for God and you even said that yourself you still with me now let's turn to Judges chapter one Judges chapter one are we still good on time I don't even know where we're at okay good as long as you say that I'm okay if we get down to one I'm getting nervous you mean 1:00 no one person saying preach Judges chapter 1 verse 17 now we've just said nothing is impossible nothing is too hard no giant right so here we go and Judah went with Simeon his brother and they slew the Canaanites that inhabiteth zeph and utterly destroyed it Glory say Glory with me glory glory and the name of the city was called horma also Judah took Gaza with the close Coast thereof Glory Glory GL say it glory glory and Escalon with the coast thereof glory and echon with the coast thereof glory and the Lord was with Judah glor and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain Glory but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had Chariots of iron what Chariots of iron are we reading the same Bible wait they could drive out Giants and major things in iron is going to stop God okay okay let's okay let's let's may maybe this is a fluke let's let's go to verse 27 neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethan and her towns uhoh it starts to travel through the church the family nor and her towns nor the inhabitants of D and her towns nor the inhabitants of elim and her towns nor the inhabitants of megadoo and her towns but the Canaanites would dwell in that land and it came to pass that when Israel was strong so they were strong and they could have drove them out they put Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out we went from glory to Chariots of iron we went from glory to something in our life this is a very sad state for Israel it shows the unbelief of Judah and the beginning of the demise of Israel and those of whom lost confidence from the Chariots of iron and other battles because they thought that they were too great to defeat that they left them in the land but they thought okay you know what let's let let's let's let's make a pack with him let's make tribute that they forced them into labor or maybe this will be an economic Advantage for us allow me to bring this into a type of this message you can stay I'm going to control you are you are you with me I'm going to control you and you not me listen whatever God told you to get out of your life whatever demon whatever family thing that you were told to utterly destroy is not your buddy and we don't need to make tribute with it so if you see in history you will see little encampments of Canaanites or inhabitants that Israel could not budge all around summon heels and summon valleys and they allowed them to stay you ever had things in your life that you just couldn't Buy budge but the main problem with it was is they made tribute with him and God said don't do it don't make tribul you can't control those things that Satan will use to drag you down they'll go away for some time think about it what happened between that and David the Book of Judges what happened all kinds of turmoil think about it what happened what happened to what happened to Israel that shouldn't have happened once it gets to you it look I want you to get I want you to catch this God said don't do it don't make tribute with it don't leave it in your life and sometimes we go to some natural thing that we can see or that we can hold to and a lot of times we think that it's a it's a thing and it's a thing and if we can and and Satan gets us to look at the thing and I get it I get it sometimes things need to be removed visibly so don't don't crucify me but I want to say this sometimes things aren't enough sometimes it's inside is you can you can clean out your house you can take all the couches out and you can get it to where you have nothing but a mattress and carpet and you can take out the fridge you can have nothing in there and you can still have the stinking flesh what good is it going to do God said don't do it you cannot control those things that Satan will use to drive it because once it gets a hold of you it won't let you go I want to quote portion of Isaiah 14:17 it says that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the city of that open not the house or the doors of his prisoners it won't open up the doors once hell gets a hold of you it won't open those doors but I want to encourage you that no matter how long it takes keep pressing and clearing out all that doesn't belong that's right Israel made a mistake they should have cleared it out are you still here they should have done it and because they didn't it caused generation after generation come on young people you might be suffering because of generational stupidity listen I'm okay with saying that in front of my parents because my dad admits it he made mist mistakes and you know what I'm okay with my son saying that in front of me because I was if you don't like that word I apologize I'll say foolish in front of you but my son I made foolish mistakes and so my son had to make some uh had to suffer for some of those things but I've told him come on don't make the same mistakes that I made and I'm going to tell you young people don't make the same mistakes don't make it harder on the Next Generation somebody's got to stop that and we can keep saying it and keep making the same mistake but you have been given a charge to clear the land but until you do notice what happened here they were given all of this land and fight after fight after battle after battle it comes all the way down and I want to go to one place and there was one place brother Billy that just seemed it was in penetrable no matter how hard Israel would fight they could never attain it and it would eventually be known as Mount Zion or the city of David Zion in scripture is the city of the great king the place of the throne but it was inhabited by the jebusites in other words this en enemy is squatting in a place that does not belong to him the name jebusites means to tread down underf fooot to pollute to defile the holy things of God the jebusites had no intention of relinquishing its ground now Zion was a stronghold that was impenetrable so I want you to imagine it was all the way up at the top it was impenetrable because of the the natural Topography of the land it was a fort on top of a mountain to scale the sharp walls of the mountain you'll have to be Heavenly armed as Defender as the Defenders inside of the fort would shoot arrows at you pour hot oil on you and do what ever is at their disposal to stop the Invaders from scaling the walls from the outside so we're talking from the moment now the very beginning there would have been nothing to stop them but because they didn't listen in the beginning they missed out what has your stronghold what is the very last thing that's holding you the very last thing that's giving you the edge where you can see further than you've ever seen all right poor hot o onion do whatever is at their disposal to stop the Invaders let's say let's just say that you went past the arrows let's say you made it past the hot oil let's say you made it past all the stones brother then on the North side there was a thick Iron Gate that would stop you entering the fort there was no way battle after after battle nobody was able to overcome it because of its strategic position on a high mountain and its thick Iron Gate blocking the entrance into the zity city Zion had a long history of successful withholding Invasion under Joshua Judah uh could not drive the jebusites from its stronghold Joshua 1563 later on in judges when the benjamites settled in Jerusalem they also were unable to dislodge the jebusites listen it got to a point when when all the way even down to David the jebusites were so confident in their Fort that they said their lame and blind could fight them off 2 Samuel 5:6 says and the King and his men went to Jerusalem unto the jebusites and the habitant of the land which spake unto David saying except thou take away the Blind and the lame Thou shalt not come hither thinking David cannot come in hither basically in Translation it says you'll never get in here even the Blind and crippled can keep you out can I bring this down to this it says that thing in your life is mocking you you can never overcome [Music] me I have such a strong hold in your life I have your heavenly peace I have your heavenly place I have that position I want you to imagine it was all of this time and it wasn't until all of the battles all of the situations and it wasn't until David finally came along because you know it's the city of David so you know it was him and I know you know the answer how he did it but I'm going to read it to you anyways it wasn't until David come along where where he where it was finally conquered notice and I don't I'm not going to have the exact number some 300 years later from when they could have done it put up that first pick brother so how did he do it and I'm going to read this as they as they put this up in this this C if you can see this as I read it look at the the uh the jebusite Water tunnel and that spring when David's men now they recognized they could not attack it from outside when David's men captured Jerusalem in 104 BC the city was much smaller than it is today and was confined to the low North South Ridge called oal meaning the hump to the south side to the south of what is now the Temple Mount David's Heavenly heavily armed men took the Defenders by surprise as they climbed up through the narrow vertical shaft in the sloping tunnel that enabled the je jebusites to haul water up from the uh Gian spring outside the wall into their fortified City on the top of the oal hill after being occupied by David's forces the old jebusite city became known as the city of David and the ridge on which stood was renamed Mount Zion so the only way to conquer it was to go from the inside and not from the out put the other picture from the inside this little tiny tunnel it took what seemed insignificant the Conquering came from within this is unconventional yet God works in unconventional ways 1 Corinthians 1:27 but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God ha chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty and the base things of the world and the things which are despised hath God chosen yay and the things which are not to bring to not the things are that no flesh no outside things should glory in his presence it takes something on the inside yes to defeat the jebusites in our lives we're always trying to work on the outside we're always trying to fix the outside we're always trying to prove something I'm going to do this I'm going to do this and we all trying to work on the outside notice what he says in power of transformation he says lo let the Holy Spirit come upon any person that's got true that's truly got something down there a healing comes from the inside let that healing come from the spirit that's in you if it's a genuine uh spirit anointing the genuine speed a seed it can do nothing but bear a son or daughter of God but the genuine Spirit can come up a cockabur seed the rain can fall Upon A cockabur and it will it will live just the same as it falls upon a wheed and make it live but by their fruits you shall know them and wear a fruit tree of God bearing his word listen these cancers are no longer allowed in our families the only way we we've got to quit trying to come at it from the outside self-help this and self promote this and all types of things you're trying to throw all kinds of things at this flesh you got to quit you've got to allow God it's Jesus on the inside working on the outside oh what a change in my life [Music] amen you ain't going to do nothing I'm not going to do nothing I can't do nothing to you Jesus has got to do something for you go ahead let your family go through 300 years of the jebusites and the Hittites but I promise you you're going to have a David rise up that's going to finally catch on and it's going to say I've had enough brother Billy I've had enough I don't care what they did before I'm going to go back to what the Lord said to Moses and what went on to Joshua and I'm going to obey the word of God I'm going to not just go to a church that speaks a prophet I'm going to live what the prophet said not just because he's a prophet but because he pointed us to the word of God these cancers are no longer allowed in our families we have listened to the lies of our fathers for too long because it has been told that we've got to clear the land why go all the way back he desires to bring us to intimacy with his word but if we cannot get to that land how can we be intimate with him he said don't mix it what has what has been the entire message as it were separate yourself come out from among them and yet we find ourselves trying to mix with this thing and mix with this thing denomination coming back into the message listen it will never mix with the message you can say you're a Christian but there's only the Christian you can say your message but there's only the message Hallelujah there's all all kinds of potential Jews but there's only the Jews you follow what I'm trying to say separate yourself and come out from among them we're not here pointing fingers in anybody and saying your message and you're not you will know them by their what is the fruits listen I want the word of God I want more than just coming to church I don't want to just put on guardar this morning I want a relationship with Jesus Christ I want to become intimate with his word I've got to get rid of the lies of the fathers I got to get rid of the lies of the families I want to come under the anointing of the word and stay in thus sayth the Lord Church you get in thus sayith the Lord you will make it all the way who wants to get under thus sayith the Lord you get under thus say the Lord there ain't no hell or high water that'll stop you there is no cancer there is no disease there is no situation there is no family member there is nothing that'll be able to stop you there is no demon there is no giant there is no Chariots of iron that'll ever be able to stop you but you need to come under thus sath the Lord not thus sayith Jeremy not thus saith this one that one thus sayith the Lord what did he say what is his thoughts about you what is the word of this hour he said possess the book possess the message and you're going to be tested for it your family's going to come against you and they may even be in this I used to think when I was younger there was going to be a lot without but it seems like it's more within who's going to stand if you're an inhabit you will not hello if you're an inhabit you will eventually crumble but if you're a possessor you will fight for every inch of ground you won't be a zombie in church you'll have a heartbeat why did you get quiet cuz I was listening for heartbeats heartbeats of the word of God hungry for more God I want more of you I'm not satisfied with just church membership you've been given a charge father to clear the land you've G been given a charge mother to clear the land young person you're not left out you've been

end of this it's as if a one snap of our fingers and would be over go back to the moment brother Billy when brother Brandon was preaching on uh it just slipped my mind but he was pre Souls that are in prison when it come to the end of souls in prison could you hear the Cry of the prophet of God at the very end of Souls and prison when he was crying for his family what was he feeling there what was he feeling as if it was right there at the end if you forgot go back to that listen to that whole sermon and go back to what he what he was crying out for let's not forget I'm not trying to discourage

through that tunnel they would never conquer that but they were willing to go through that they were willing to get through that murky dark and it was times they couldn't see but they knew if they could just keep going through that they could get to that place where they could finally take what no one could take for all of those years May there be somebody that will finally reach that pinnacle
