commit to service to you and we thank you when we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen uh Brother David had a he had a procedure done uh in his mouth I believe it was a crowning in his uh uh mouth and uh uh he was numb and he's having difficulties is just speaking properly so he wanted us to just continue off the tape we listened uh last Wednesday so let's just open our Bibles and read the scripture before we uh we continue so it was Revelations chapter 3 let's read verse 21 a very familiar scripture read it says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne he that heareth the he that hasn't hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches amen so I believe last time we stopped around about paragraph 82 or 84 I believe at the end of 82 so we're going to continue on 83 and we'll listen to just about 30 minutes of it uh which will lead us all the way to I believe it's uh paragraph 142 amen amen so we'll do that uh again just remember Brother David I know he wanted to be here and um but he he understood that he was having difficulties just speaking correctly so he decided not to be hereen amen and so let's just go on and and and start from 183 and sorry I'm sorry 83 all the way to 142 amen God bless you may have your seats she started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome or she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom of L but she wanted to go back and have her haircut you know anyway she had go back she just couldn't stand the the test she had to look back again to see what the rest of them was doing oh you know I had some good friends down there after all and after all this might be just a little a little move I don't know whether it could be right or not I've only got this man's word for though he's my husband but yet uh your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking you see now whether it it could be a ride or not I don't know maybe his Revelation wasn't right then if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the word of God then then you can't go you got to be really sold out that's right you got to know Hallelujah not just well I see others doing it I see a sign you know Israel started out I could say the same thing and bring it in here they started out two million strong and ended up with two man amen right they saw the works of God they saw the manifestation of the spirit they saw Great Mighty Miracles being done there in Egypt and everything it started out but it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome they just come out and Jesus said and they perished in the wilderness and are eternally dead every one of them is dead that means Eternal separation every one of them rotted in the wilderness but there was two men Joshua and Caleb and when it come to The Showdown the obstacles was so great because they look like grasshoppers side of joshu screamed out with Caleb and said we are more than able to do it why God said and they were Overcomers they overcome they was the ones that was privileged out that whole great organization of people that take the real elected bride into the promised land Joshua C and the front lines out there as the two generals L them right down to the river and cross the river over into the promised land why they believe the word no matter what the Nathan ra naan brother raised up and so did Kora and they tried to say this man's trying to make himself above all the rest of us he's more holy than the rest of them after God had thoroughly ADV indicated the man they said we'll just start a group of people we'll make this that other we'll make our organizations we do and they died and perish but those men had that word of the Lord and they stayed with it and they went over not he that starts he that finishes many start the race but there's one finished there will be many churches start many groups of people there'll be one group finished amen that's the Overcomers Lots days yes she had to have that one great long look back oh I'm leaving so and so down there them fine times we used to have I'll never forget it she was clocked shut up like it was in the days of Noah she was shut out without mercy and she perished and the the lump still stands there today they claim I don't know you can break a piece off of it and it'll grow back a salt pillar if you ever see that uh picture of Sodom and Gomorrah you'll see the original a pillar of salt that stood there now there's a difference between a pillar of salt and a pillar of fire you have turn one notice in John the Baptist time in John the Baptist time there was found six that had overcome all ages they've had Overcomers in John's time they had six that was Joseph and Mary Zachariah and Elizabeth Simon and an a man and a woman a man and a woman a man and a woman see type of Christ the church Christ the church Christ the church amen notice it starts from the natural man no mo Joseph the natural man Joseph what was he a carpenter then the priest what was he see a minister in the house of the Lord Zachariah and from that the s a prophet amen and a prophet see thech justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost don't you see perfectly six overcome all the rest of them they offered their sacrifices and everything but these were elected they overcome notice each Church age the same overcome when they each some out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age I got the scriptures here I don't think we really have time to make it but you know each one of the churches same now it's just like someone who is see as I said at the beginning you're born defeated and that birth can never bring you to to uh life because you're born defeated and you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people among defeated Creeds uh defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory some way it's just like a lily where is a lily I think is one of the most pretty flowers that there is I'm very fond of those great cow lies and pond lies I think there's nothing hard as pretty as a great big a Pond Lily call it water lily how it's radiance and where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy Mucky Pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's in that mud but it has to stri daily knowing that there's something it's black it's dirty it's mocky it's slimy and that's slime that it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the MU and the waters in the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time I think that's an overcomer at once in sin once did things that was wrong don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then uh now why look back into the pond again see look you have God by his predestination see has brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to life and now on top of all of that it has overcome see it doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up to express itself neither did you and your your sin and adultery and everything that you lived in you didn't Express that but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into life and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it brought out what you really was in the beginning you see what I mean you saw the light you blo down you laid your heart open and now you're a lily you remember my sermon on the Lily reverent Lily how he TS yet does he not spin and yet Solomon all his glory is not a ra like one he's he he he he look at him he's ready to get he takes nothing for himself the Lily don't care nothing about himself what does he do he he thrs his Beauty out his life that others might see his life is expressed out that others might see the glory what's in him that was in him in that mud now he's on top that's the Overcomer he overcome the mother he overcome the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on him he's a real over coming you can't say nothing about him now would say come out of the mud but he's not in the mud now he's on top of it amen you can't find for back what he was what is he now amen he's on top then the bee comes by and said that wonderful perfume I believe I'll go and get my part he just opens up his heart come on I'm all right everything takes from him see he's he's a real Pastor he expresses the glory of God and look where he come from he had to overcome to do that one time he or she was young Fair beautiful they had a lot of Temptations to go through but they overcome that see they overcome now the express the real beauty of Christ in their life notice expressing through the mud Jesus gave us the example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it see humility sked himself duck a towel wash the disciples feet and wiped him the very God Of Heaven hum humiliating himself we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want their hair to go that's right the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like man don't want to see it's the same thing they don't they they get humiliated but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness um go to say something greatness hum humiliates itself gra humbles itself great I've had the privilege of getting meeting some great man and if these guys has got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket and rattle that's the guy that thinks he's something with he know but I stood a great man I me great man with ragged sleeves cuffs may make you think you're the great person see greatness is humility don't forget that church greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be I don't mean dirty now I mean humble in spirit amen I don't mean just get get out and over wash and clean up that you should do that you know that but I'm talking about humility genuine humility not something put on something it is that's real humility Jesus told us how to do it he overcome mean overcome means to stand the test that's right like uh all the old Saints did like Jesus did in midst of all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness and him being Messiah he healed in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of calvary's own death he defeated it by surrendering himself why by the word that you destroy this p and all raised up in three days the word said so and in the presence of death he defeated he overcome death in the presence of hell he defeated hell and overcome hell yes in the presence of the Grave he overcome the grave amen why all by the word in humility oh my there's the real man there's the one that make your example see he defeated everything overcome it look Temptation was for him you know that the Bible said he is tempted in all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by by drinking he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes Ser overcome needs to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks a lot of people says there is no devil just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil amen just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then the same time that you you recognize him and know it he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mighter than he [Music] is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him there's real overcoming when you recognize you look back say I'm doing this and I'm doing that you're defeated but there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome and you know that he's a devil you can't say I got a sick I don't believe it is a sickness oh yeah it is a sickness you got cancer you don't believe it is a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer but remember greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing and he is in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible exactly the way the scripture is written overcome I got to that I got 45 minutes now I'm really running over time now notice overcome the god that's in you is greater than the one that's in him the god of the world is not as great as the god of Heaven which is in you no more than Darkness can stand in the presence of light now Darkness cannot stand in the presence of life I don't care how dark it is light will put it out amen it can't stand Glory but you take as much dark as you want to and try to stand against light one time see what happened that's the one that's in you is light amen and the one that's in the world is Darkness amen so the light has proved to overcome the darkness and a man that's in Christ and knows that he's overcome the things of the world Amen hey man has no more TI to you all you're free walk in the light amen as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin and we have Fellowship one with another there you are he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world now if you look right you're condemned then you're you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that's in you has led you above the darkness like the Lily he's above the darkness of the mud he's above the darkness of the Muddy Waters he is in the light reflecting the beauty that was put in him before he left the mud Hallelujah now I feel like shouting praise God Christian what was in there by godall at the beginning it pressed its way through overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the mud had overcome the waters had overcome everything I was an overcomer and reflected the beauty and glory of God that's the way every believer does that's the way Noah did that's the way lot did that's the way look what a mess he was in that's the way Moses did that's the way Joshua did That's the Way Daniel did that's the way Shadrach mishak did that's the way John the Baptist did Zachariah Elizabeth that's the way that Simeon that's the way that Anna every one of them did they overcome the mud that was around them and packed into them stuck their head above the thing and shine forth the glory of God that's what a real Christian does remember Jesus showed her how it's done 40 days of Temptation he was tempted above any man that ever could be tempted in the temptation of Jesus Christ watch he showed us how it's done I I will close just in a few minutes look he showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word that's how he did for he was the word and the Jesus said if you abide me in my words than you you're back the word again am the Word of Promise what is the Word of Promise to every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then how do I overcome not me but the word that's in you the word is God then I'll overcome the things of the world because it's a word in me if you abide me my words and you then just ask what you will just keep pressing up you're coming to the top as sure as anything see you got to come to top it's 40 days of Temptation by God's word he overcomes I want to express something here just for a few minutes Satan made three major assaults upon him and that Temptation watch this always in three don't forget me he made three major assaults from the highest to the lowest he tried his best to conquer him but he was a word what did he use himself the word Satan's three major attacks or assaults app point but he made it with the word every attack he can make it with the word watch this now from the highest to the the first he made his attacked upon to use his great power which he know he was the word he know his position you believe he did I the son of man he know his position and Satan come and want him to use his own power on himself the feed him want to feed himself he's hungry a man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal Rob beg bar anything see that appetite and Satan used his first great major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome with and Ed it on himself he didn't use it on himself no he used it on others amen that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't far here though he could have done it yeah he certainly could have done it but see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him he minded only what the father said to Hallelujah that's right he said by S say it's written you give the angel charge he said yes but it's also written there he are see he knew who he was Satan did the thought runs deeper than what it's wrote see it's inspiration the kernel is on the inside of it you see what it really is though he could have done he didn't do it but he he never paid heed to Satan's proposition now here's a good thing see sometime Satan can take you and when you think that you're doing the work will of God and can make you a proposition you'll fall apart yes sir you sure can now let's just take for instance like our sisters they're pretty and he can get you to a place that you let your hair grow out you didn't realize it looks so nice on you the first thing you know you get kind of feeling a little stuck up a little above something else some of you man you know what I mean see and he can take that same thing and proposition it with you right you got to overcome that you remember you're living for God you have one objective and that's Jesus Christ out side of that there's nothing else counts that's him and secondly for your family then thirdly for yourself but first for God next for your family next for you you're number three that's in the road you put yourself last he did look what he could have done but I could call my father speak to him me straight way send me 12 Legions of Angel one could destroy the world that if my kingdom is this world and I subject to th but my kingdom is of above there he are see could have done that but he didn't though he could have done it he never listened to Satan's proposition now have you heard people say if if you believe there a Divine healer if you're a Divine healer Go Get Your Divine healer I got a man over here sick I'd like to see him healing is that same devil amen he's trying to proposition with you he's trying to make you listen to him instead of God but a real true servant of God will listen to see what father says like the little stats clip baby when they sent over here M said brother Brandon I called from Germany there was an American army with one of their Jet Plane sitting out here at the field would fly me to Germany back in a day he was a chapl and the baby's laying dead and that little Mother's screaming she said listen said I know I stood right there and seen that woman hold that dead baby in her arms have died that morning I see brother B walk right out there lay hands on that dead baby to come to life said this is my baby brother B never been a death in their family see and this little thing took sick one morning and died that afternoon girl was all of them standing around giving prophecies and things the babies going to raise up and all like that I said well it's mighty nice sister second but let me see what father saiden and I went out to the woods and I prayed come back in she done call two three times for got back the next morning nothing the doctor said all right said if that if you have faith like that lady we'll never let the baby leave the hospital let it lay right here you stay right here with it that's all right brother St went seen the Army and major they said sure we will find him over bring him back and there was a plane setting waiting to take me over that morning R me back at night to Germany hi highberg Germany for the resurrection of this baby I said sure God can do it but let's see what he willing then I went out prayed all night nothing happened come back the next morning nothing happened and I started into the room just then I looked there and there stood that light hanging there in the door said don't put your hand on that don't rebuke that that's a hand of God I got her on her phone I said sister St be your baby it's a hand of the lord it's God's will something Happ that baby down along the line you leave it go right where God knows where it's at you can go to it now that lives you won't you leave it right like that that great Lutheran preacher in Germany wrote a letter and said how I can appreciate what brother Brandon waiting for that clear-cut decision of God before he said anything that's it oh to God's decision no matter what others say whatever it is don't proposition Satan at all if Satan says now water baptism name father that he proposes you leave it alone God said otherwise he said you're a good man man you don't have to be your good woman you don't have to do don't you proposition if the word says something different you stay with the word what is that's the example Jesus give to you and there's that major assault see that he made on you then the second assault a hurry just look like your time just go so fast the next greatest assult was that he made upon him that he would be a show and how that does hit God's servant to be a show off to show what you can do glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer I'm so come up here on top of the temple and sit down here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it yeah hard so now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this Temple Jump Off see I'll give you the scripture for because it's written he give the Angels charge over thee that's any time that Dash your foot against the stone bear the up to make him aure to show his authority no true servant of God ever does that you see a man showing off his chest out and all like that just remember there's something wrong there amen no God don't want that Jesus set the example he could have done it he certainly could have done it but he didn't do it no servant of God is a show off of himself to try to take God's power and show himself above somebody else you remember Moses did that you remember God gave him power to do whatever he wanted to made him a prophet he walked down to that rock and he spoke the rock the second time that was against God's will God said speak to that rock don't Smite it again you break all the all the the type here the Rocks only go to be smitten once but he spoke of the weakness of the word when he did that it wasn't sufficient yeah the word was what was going on that rock was the word see he first time he smoked the Rock and the waters come forth and then they got thirsty again he said now go back and speak to the Rock he only smitten once see the insufficiency of the word Moses testified to it the word wasn't right he had to be smitten again so Moses went down there and smoked the rock like that said come forth didn't come forth so he spot it again and said come forth I command you to come forth the water come God said come up here come here you glorified yourself you took my power instead of sanctifying me you Sanctified yourself now you're not going over in look over see what it looked like but here you going to leave right here oh my there never has been one like Moses you know oh no when he come to that show off with Jesus he said get up on the temple here and jump off he said it's written amen don't temp the Lord thy God he met him with the word that every major assault old true servant ever tries to show himself off with God's power if he does he loses right then third great assault Satan offered to Forfeit this Kingdom to him he did Satan said see came into the world these are mine I'll do with them whatever I want to I'll forit them to you but you remember he was trying to get into forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have touch the kingdom but he must follow the he must come back he was tempted to do it now death's a hard thing he was tempted to take Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if you did his subject would have die Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind mean he didn't good he come and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we this morning willing to do take that same route that he take are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves up to God far all the world and things to serve for him now he failed to do it willingly to to Forfeit it Satan was to him but he didn't do it though Jesus was tempted he overcome for us he he endured all Temptations for me and for you see he could CH it right then but what did he take the other route for so that we could come be with him and if he paid such a price as that then how little would we be not to take it when you remember there's nothing here anyhow right if you live a 100 years why you go to come to mental in your mind gone all crippled up and old and shaky that's where you're going that's right and that's the end of it you come now overcome the things how do you do it by the word amen what the word says you do walk humble live before Jesus he endur all right that is so practical it is the word in its reality it's not some concept or some education that you go learn and no it's something that you put in practice I I just I wish we could continue but there just so much I just thought if you go back from where we started he's basically it starts with Lot's wife so really the understanding is it's not just because you started it means you're going to overcome overcoming is not just starting because many started you know many received the word I mean even this message of the hour you think about the crowds that bam was able to put together when he started and how many people came through the meetings and everything but when you follow it all the way towards the end he was not even invited out of places many came and they heard and they follow but it was not to just follow because he talks about years Lot's wife he says she started off as an overcomer but she turned into a pillow of salt why because she was not all in it she still had something that she wanted to look forward to and something that she had in her heart that wanted to look back amen that's why when we come to Christ we come everything we don't leave anything behind and when we become a Christian we don't try to walk the line between the Fellowship of the world and the fellowship of God no we break every line we break every connection everything we come all hard ourselves everything that we are we jump into it with everything that we have why because if you have something tying you back it will take you back the the the the thing about you know that's why you hear it says it's the word and nothing else it's because if you try to mix the word of God with anything any measure of of of uh of of yeast any measure of anything will cause it to overflow and to blow up that's what Eve started in the Garden of Eden the scripture says that she was given the pure word of God a pure word of God don't eat off the tree but what did she do she took the LIE of the devil as being God's truth and it caused the whole thing to fall apart and bham says that was the cause for every hospital every sickness everything that we see today it was because someone tried to take the word and mix it with leaven with something else someone took the pure word that was given and tried to mix it so it's by the pure word of God that we overcome it's not by try to mix it with anything else it's the pure word that we go with and then he talks about Israel paragraph 84 it says you know Israel started out it says I could say the same thing uh it it bring them here it says they stand out two million strong and ended up two men it it always starts out with the crowd right it always starts out with the group of people rejoicing and jumping up and down and everything but at the end it's only the elected that would stand I I love it because here it is he talks about that and then right over he jumps over he says he talks about he jumps in and it says paragraph 85 it says but there was two men Joshua and Caleb he said uh when he came to The Showdown the it says the obstacles was not so great till they look like grasshoppers uh on the side of them Joshua screamed out with Caleb and said we are more than able to do it he asked why God said so so the difference is the Overcomer only stands upon the word of God it's the Word of Promise that would carry them it's not by their own strength it's not by their own education it's not because they've gathered up enough knowledge and now they feel they can do it no the Overcomer knows that I'm here because I have received a promise and within God's promise God has the ability for that promise to carry you through I I I'll just say it I was I was uh um I was just listening but when I'm speak some in the message uh El Sharia and he talks about Abraham and he says that here Abraham was and he said he went waited and he waited for the promise of God and and yeah he was getting old and we know how he speaks about El shadia said he was the breasted one so he came and andam speaks he said he come and he text Abraham and he said I want you I want you to to nurse the strength out of me and and receive strength so you can carry on and all of that and at one place but said the promise that was given to him continued to sustain him for the 25 years that he was waiting so it wasn't by Abraham's strength that he received the promise it was the promise that God gave him when he says I will give you a child that promise was good enough to take him through trial through Temptation through the ups and down everything that he went through that promise kept him because he was a recipient of the promise the child could not come by anybody else except Abraham and and so when we are gathered here when we receive the promise of the Rapture it doesn't matter what else the devil can throw on your way is it a job that you need is it the sickness that comes by your way is it this is it that you can know for sure that because I have received a promise I am able to overcome because I cannot God will not take me off of this Earth until that promise come to pass so it's the assurance that a True Believer has within thems to know that Joshua and Caleb as they stood there they know I have received God told us we're going to overcome this we didn't it's not us just coming up and say oh we want to overcome by our own Tre no we received this was the promise that God made us that this land belongs to us so it didn't matter if we look like grasshoppers it didn't matter they knew that the promise will produce the strength they needed in order for them to overcome the land so it's always by promise that's why when we go to pray you you it's very important you rem by what promise am I standing here by what promise am I praying I'm sick by what promise you said in your word it's by your Strife that I'm Healed so I claim the promise that you have given because remember the promise is not some future event the promise is the presence of God walking with you because the word of God is God himself so if he gives you his word he gives you of himself self sometimes we think well I have the word of God now I'm waiting for God no his word is himself you have the word of God you have God himself so he said God said so and they were Overcomers they overcame it says they overcame there was one there was one that was uh uh uh privileged out of the whole great organization of people to take to take the real elected bride into the promised land Joshua and Caleb in the front line out there as the two generals it said LED them right down to the river and cross cross the river into the promised land why they believe the word no matter what amen amen oh if we could just come tonight and say Do you have do you have trouble yeah I have trouble but I believe the word no matter what do you have difficulties yeah I'm going through difficulties I don't know how to solve this this is going on that's going on but I believe the word no matter what oh I'm sick I believe the word no matter what I don't have a job I believe the word I need the Holy Spirit I believe the word no matter what because within that God will produce it it's not for you to produce it it's for him to produce it through the promise you leave the promise you're not going to get it you stay with the promise it's bound to happen and it says here now in paragraph it says it says now he says but those men now speaking about those Overcomers those men had the word of the Lord and they stayed with it they went over because they stayed with the word it says not he that started he that finishe many started the race but there's one finishing it there will be many churches start many groups of people there will be one group finished that's the Overcomer it's him that finishes you know the script says many will say where is the sign of his coming you know since our father slept everything continues the same Wars this is not the first time they heard about wars it's Wars and wars and Wars but there will be those that will finish it why because regardless no matter of what was happening they believe and they held on to the word now and then after he says this he speaks a great deal about uh just how many uh the Overcomers you will find out as you continues on that they were always found in the minority it's not it was never uh all that started it was never a group of people or a majority that started the the Overcomers were always found in the minority so then he jumps on from there now he says but the Overcomers are only the elected now think about it so he speaks about Lot's wife he comes and he speaks about those that overcame and then he goes over the next thing for the characteristics of those that over come you will find out that are they are only those that are elected to overcome so if you're going to overcome is because you were elected to overcome it's not because you mastered up the strength enough to you to go and overcome no it's because God in the beginning before there was a sky before there was a heaven before there was anything he thought about you being here he thought about you being an overcomer and that only in itself will make you over come no matter what the challenge is so he says but these were elected they overcame so he speaks about in the paragraph 92 he says and I see I I said in the beginning you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you are born defeated and you are you are in a defeated World among defeated people among I just love this among defeated Creed defeated denomination you've got to come to Victory somehow I love it you say why you love it because there's no hope for this flesh if if if if we only going to go by this flesh if we only going to go by natural birth where we came from who were our parents every we are already defeated to begin with if we are only counting on our ability to study the Bible to know the scripture you you just you you're not going to make it the only reason was because there was a seed that was planted in the beginning the seed that was planted in the beginning is made to overcome so therefore it doesn't matter what this flesh came from whether the flesh came from Africa it came from Europe it came from America that didn't matter it didn't matter if the flesh was born under hard circumstance easy circumstance that didn't matter because what matter was there was a seed within the flesh amen hallelujah Bor defeated but you're got to come to Victory how you going to come to the victory there's a seat in there thank you Lord he speaks about Reverend Lily paragraph 93 he says just like Lily it says Lily I think that's one of the most prettiest flower that there is he says I'm very fond of those uh uh uh uh Cales and the pon Lily I think there's nothing hard ly as as as pretty as a as a great big Pond Lily call it water lily it says how how it's radiant now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of the M maky Pond he says that little seed yet all the radiance that will ever shine in it is right in it right then it says when it when it's in the M when it it's in that m but it has to strive daily knowing that there's something there's something it's black it's dirty it's mocky it's slimy in the Slime it's living that it's living in it yet it's pressing way through the mck through the mud mck and the water and the stagnant places until it sticks his head above you you don't let your your fleshly fail stop you from serving God you don't let your mistake stop you from serving God if if this Lily looked at and said I can't even see outside I I'm I'm just all I look it's Darkness it's markets everything I don't think God wanted me because if God wanted me to serve him I should have been looking at the sunshine no it's going to get to the sunshine in the process of pressing in the process of going forward in a process of pushing I do wrong I don't want to do wrong I'm gonna continue I say this I don't want to say this I'll continue it continue to push until it find itself in the presence of the sonallah that's what an overcomer is andam will say that it says paragraph 94 I think that's an overcomer that once in sin once did the things that was wrong don't worry about it now once it once did things that was wrong then now why look back into the pond again see look you have it says God I love this by pred by his predestination see has brought the seed to life and a pressing itself see coming to light and now now on top of all that it's it's it it's it's it has overcome see it it doesn't Express itself down there it's express it says it's it's getting up to express itself neither did you in your sin adultery every anything that you lived in you didn't Express nothing you said when you were drinking you had the seed in you oh yeah when when I was doing wrong I was lying and stealing and and doing wrong there was yeah there was a seed in there but it was not it couldn't Express himself in that environment it took the sunlight to shine upon that seed and to hit the seed for it to look at the drinking and say I don't want to drink anymore to look at the Li and say I don't want to lie anymore to look at all the things around you and say I don't want this anymore and he started pressing itself out that that's the very character characteristics of a Believer without that you're just a a church member without that you're just a church member it's when you look at your life and say I know what I used to be I know what I was capable of but if I can live this life today it's not by My Own Strength something happened to [Applause] me there has to be that within you that you can look and look at what you were and look at what you are today and see that something has been pressing on something was pressing on when when I was lying something was pressing on and when I was cheating something was pressing on when I was doing all those things something has been pressing on it's going to continue to press to press till the Rapture the pressing doesn't stop it's not because now you came and you recognize God the Press no the pressing will continue every day you do wrong de pressing come down and said stand up son you're not supposed to do that let's carry on we have a job to do we have a mission to finish God doesn't start a job that he hand up halfway no when he starts something he brings it to the end you didn't Express nothing need to be aware of time don't do that but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself to the light oh God thank you for the seed thank you because the overcoming is the seed of God inside of me that's driving me every day that's leading me that's that's taking me out of the trouble that I get myself every day I get myself in trouble today the seeds get me out I do wrong tomorrow the seeds gets me out why it's taking me to a destination and if I keep my eyes on that promise I keep my eyes on that seed I will surely get to the destination if the musician could come that's just one page so there's no way if I go through every page it's just going to we're not going to ever finish it's just wonderful and I just want to say and I think this is how God wants us to view ourselves he he wants us to know to to to know to be aware that we are constantly a work in progress that when we we we need to keep our focus on the seed that is inside of us and upon the promise that's been given us he doesn't want us to be because remember says when he speaks about the devil he says one of the things he wants you to do he wants to take your focus away he wants you to worry about him so he he he he's he's like a a magician so he's putting the action here trying to get you to look upon him oh I want to do this I want to do this whereas he actually moving and and I thought about even the very text or that very um message that brother uh brother Matthew read about the the devil when it was asked when the chat CPT was asked about if I was the devil how how is it that I can influence you so it's never him coming bluntly and saying don't serve God it's by him causing you to look for something else look for a job that's going to pay more look for a success over here look to achieve this look to it and neglect the very seed that's inside of you to overcome with that's right cause you to neglect the very word of God that you need to continually feed on so you can become stronger always is causing you to keep you sidetracked so you can keep your focus on him causing you to try to use your power for yourself causing you to try to show off causing you what was it it was the same way that he came to Jesus say but when I'm said here so he's constantly trying to uh create a diversion something for you to look at uh look at this new uh uh uh uh news and there's always something new out there if you want to look at it there's always something new that the devil has to offer and new way of doing things a new way of thinking but at the end of it it's all death it's not taking you anywhere what is it doing it for because if you keep your eyes on those things then you lose the focus on your growth and your ability to overcome the things of the world you get to a place where why am I not overcoming I need to check am I actually relying on the sea that's inside of me am I actually recalling the promise that's been given to me because that's what I need in order for I me to live an overcoming life I'm not doing it by myself it's not by my strength but I know one thing that I'm here I'm hearing the word of God I'm eating of the word of God I'm relying on the seed that's inside of me to grow and I know that when that seed will grow it will give me power to overcome the challenges that I'm facing to overcome the things that surround me it will give me power to make the right decisions it will cause me to say things the right way it will cause me to live a life that's pleasing to him now remember he said this it will strive to obey the word even when people will try to come to you remember it was talking about that baby was sick oh you can pray for it you can do this they said no you have to wait on what he said you it's not going to try to cause you to show off what I'm a Christian I should be able to do this no what does God want me to do why because it's by the word and humility if Christ himself are humble he says he humiliated himself you know I just wonder how many how many of us wants to be humiliated somebody humiliate you oh my goodness you're just about to have let them have it but Christ humiliated himself deity came and became flesh became a man so what so that we could become God greatness he says is humility greatness can be spit upon those soldiers spitting upon him say binding is is his eyes and saying tell us who hatte you that that they doing that to Greatness but greatness didn't even open its [Music] mouth that's the quality we should go after those are the qualities we need to seek to ask for every day not the ability to come and prove something even when you know no it's the ability to be humble even when you know and not to stay there as if if you didn't know somebody you know you remember they were talk about he says Oham was not able to come and everything and he's standing right there said oh I couldn't do that greatness humbling not humbling but humiliating itself let's all stand and if we can just ask tonight if our heart's desire could just be God I I want I want that kind of overcoming attitude that kind of greatness that could humble itself and not because I'm a Christian then I become something more than somebody else no but regardless of what person I meet whatever position they are in that I can reach out and help them that I can go and reach out and look at my fellow men and look at them with compassion and help them in the situation that they are going in understand that God placed me there for a reason for me to be a help and not to boast of myself and what I can what I can do and what I can show off but the ability for me to humble myself even even when I'm hurt even when people have done me wrong but I can humble myself and keep loving them because remember he he talks about love is not when you love people that love you real love is when people hate you and you know they're going to do you wrong when they get a chance to but you still love them that's the overcoming attitude and that's what we desire not just the Miracle part of it but the humility part of it and and and that other part that can humiliate itself so one could be saved so one could receive also is that your heart desire tonight amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father you are so great Lord and truly you are revealing such Simplicity father that when we read and we see these things when we look at who you really were Lord then we are so humbled by your greatness and your
