If you came into the house of the Lord with the request on your heart, make it known to him by the uplifting of your hand and trust that he'll answer your need. We ask brother Josh to take these needs and pray. And [music] may the brothers take the tithes and offerings, please come up. Let's bow our heads. [music] Heavenly Father, as we just come to you tonight, Lord, we all just come [music] with a need upon our heart, Lord. That Lord, each one of us are just going through different seasons of life. But Lord God, you know our hearts. You know our needs, [music] Lord. That Lord, we just don't come to church in vain, Lord. But Lord, we just come to worship you, Lord. That Lord God, we even have unspoken needs, Lord. You see what's going on in each one of our lives, Lord. But heavenly [music] father, we know we have a father who sees this, Lord God. And heavenly father, if there be one who just [music] comes hungry for something, Lord God, we believe you can give that portion to them. Lord, if it [music] be through the song service, the preaching, Lord, we believe you can give it, Lord. And heavenly father, we pray that your hand would just be over brother David, Lord, that you would just let him arrive back safely, [music] Lord. that Lord, you just had on his heart. So go out there and minister, Lord. Lord, we pray that once more you just keep him safe, Lord. [music] And you bless the rest of this service, Lord. You bless the tithes and offering in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. I love this song. On the wings of a [singing] soul wed up, God sends [singing] his [music] pure sweet love. A sign [singing] from above [music] on the wings [singing] of another. Oh, [music] and Noah had drifted [music] all [singing] the floods when he did. for and you [singing and music] search your name in [singing] various ways [music] and troules he oh by [singing] not from [music] oh God [singing] gave him his son oh on the wings of [music] a wings [singing] of Holy love [music] by [singing] God.

[singing] Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh consume my life. Oh [music and singing] spirit of God move an empty vessel [singing] I want to be so that you [music] can come. Oh [singing] Lord, [music] every fear of me. Amen. Amen. Is that your heart desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. Gracious Father, your feeling is what we desire, Lord. And we understand that what we have need of, we can't find it, Father, anywhere else but to you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We gathered here, Lord, as a people that's hungry for you. Father, a people expecting the rapture, a people that's been prepared for an event that is to come, Lord, we have one heart desire, and that is your, you may be made known unto us, Lord, and that our lives may reflect who you are, Father. That every action that we make may be a reflection of who you are, Lord. I know that we have so much humanity that we carry around. [music] But Lord, we have a promise tonight that if we believe that the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, if it dwelleth in us, it will also quicken our mortal bodies. Lord, we ask that you do that because that spirit is the spirit of the word. We invite you that you may just come and take this few words that we're going to speak and Lord, let it be multiplied into our hearts that it may produce the life of Christ. We thank you for those that will be able to make it in the house of God. And Father, I pray that you strengthen them and you give them that they may not go out of here the same way they came. And Father, that you may add a portion to what they are, Lord. And that you may, Father, do something special for them, oh God. And Lord, those that couldn't be here, we commit them to you. Father, you said that no man can come unto me unless I call. And we know that, Father, even our very words will fall flat. There's only one that can convert the hearts. That is you, the Lord Jesus Christ. So I pray you lead us and guide us for whatever we have need of. Let it be sat. Let us be satisfied at your table, Lord. And that everything that we look for, Lord, it may be found when we come and we dine with you. Take this service, Lord, and just touch each one, oh father, even now, Lord, and that the words of eternal life may come and be imparted to us. We commit everything we are and ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So good to be gather in the house of God. We're going to continue to remember our pastor. Don't forget to text him tomorrow for his birthday. Like brother Matthew said, you could start today and text tomorrow. So it's always wonderful. and and I was I had a chance to watch I believe one or two services and it was marvelous uh just uh the things that's moving in his heart to share with the bride around the world. Amen. Let's open our Bibles. Amen. I'm really enjoy service this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I tell you the word of God is given to us for us to live by. Let's open our Bibles. We're going to read couple of scriptures and and be seated. Uh let's read the very familiar scripture first. John chapter 1. John the 1 chapter says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things that were made were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and life was light of man and the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended not. There was a man sent from God who was uh whose name was John. The same came for witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. He was not that light, but he was sent to bear witness of the light. That was the true light which lightth every man that cometh unto the world. He was in the world and the world He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own and his own receive him not. But as many as receive him, to them give he the power to become sons and daughters, even to them that believe on his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Keep your Bibles open. And we're also going to read in Romans. We're going to read a couple of verses in Romans chapter 9 7 and 8. It said neither because it says neither because they that are seed that the seed of Abraham are this are they all neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children. But in Isaac shall thy seed be called. For that is they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to perhaps a strange title. It's amazing. We were in the back fellowshipping and it looks like it was just something within my heart that uh some of the brethrens were thinking about the same on the same vein and that is I want to speak on the word made flesh in you. The call for the word of God to be made flesh in our time. The word made flesh in you. And I want to just start out by saying that that within the hour that we are living in, it's the hour of the manifestation. Uh brother Bam will talk about the seed that was sown and there was the time for sewing. There was a time where the word had to go in the ground. But we find out that in the end time we've come right back to seed time again. And the f the the time that we are living in the prophet is wanting us to be mindful that the word that was sown in the beginning is coming to be manifested again. And you'll find out in most of the time when the prophet talks and and when he preaches even in reference to the time that we are living in he's not warning you to just look and say that oh we are going back to what Pentecost was but it's actually in certain place it will tell you that we are back right back into the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; We are right back into what the beginning of all the things was. And we understand the prophet will tell us there's two books that the devil hates is the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation because one will tell us exactly how his beginning was. His desire to uh uh uh mess with the seed is his desire to corrupt the seed. And the book of Revelation will tell us how everything ends. And I could say tonight that when we come to the church of God, we are happy because we know how the story is going to end. &gt;&gt; We are not left in darkness to figure out which is our part, how we're going to end up. We are a people that's been privileged to know how the story end. And we are reading knowing that our ends will be prosperous. We are reading. We are studying knowing that we've already made it. We were reading knowing that there's something in us that's calling for what that which we know will be manifested when all is said and done. So we as we read we we kind of have to understand that we are the children of the promise. If the word is to be manifested we are here manifesting the word of God. If the word was to produce a child in the end time if there was to be a bride but said you don't look and say that my pastor is the bride. You said, "I'm the bride." If there has to be one, I am that one. That's the kind of time we're living in where you have to put everything in. Like our brother Matthew said this morning, it's not the time uh to Peter patter or try to find or or or misjudge or be lukewarm. It's the time where you have to put everything. It's the time where you have to believe everything. It's a time where we are called to be the very elected of God. And I have some things I'm going to read here, but I just want to lay a foundation. So God opened our eyes in this end time for us to see the deception that's happening. And I want to just call out to say if you're sitting here in this building tonight, it's not by your effort that you came in. It's by God's desire for you to be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; It it it I I I've always feel within my heart, even in my own life, the word of God is the foundation on which we can stand. If we ever find out that the way we came to Christ is by was by our own effort, our effort will end somewhere. Our effort will go will take us only a certain distance. But if you can come to the realization that it was God working everything for your good, then it's going to take you farther than you ever want to be. Why? Because if we do something just by our own effort, those effort will seize. But if it's done by the word of God, it's eternal. That which will stand when the world even as the scripture says, heaven and earth will pass away, but my word will never pass away. So the same way as the scripture said, he said that he came to Abraham, he said that I have come again to you that in next year that Sarah will have a child. We need to believe as we sitting here that the same way the promise was made unto Abraham for him to have Isaac. The same way the promise is made in this time for us to be the bride. &gt;&gt; Now I and I just want to compare the two so you can really understand. The promise is made unto Abraham and God waits for Abraham and Sarah to die. God waits for Abraham and Sarah to lose the natural ability to have a child. God waits until they are at the very hands. God waits until there's no possibility for them to have a child. Then at that time, God decides to give them a child. So when they had that baby, they could look at him. Abraham could look at the baby. Sarah could hold the baby and know that this baby, I got him by the promise of God. This baby, I had no power, NO NO DESIRE, NO anything within me to bring a child. If I'm holding this baby, is only by the grace of God. And let me tell you, it's no different from us sitting here tonight. If you're going TO BE A BRIDE OF CHRIST in this end time, you will have to look at yourself and know that WITHIN MY OWN SELF, THERE IS NO OUNCE OF POWER TO BRING FORTH a bride. It's only by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's only by the grace of God. It It's not anything that we can do. It's not by anything we can produce. And I want to say this brotherham said this and I thought this was so marvelous even with what we heard this morning. He says that the word will correct the air. The word will correct the air. I THOUGHT, OH MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, IF YOU CAN APPLY THE WORD OF GOD, NOT ON YOUR FLESH, NOT ON YOUR FLESH, APPLY THE WORD OF GOD into your heart, whatever the error is IN YOUR LIFE, GOD WILL CORRECT IT. Thank you. &gt;&gt; We we WE THE THE TROUBLE WE RUN INTO MOST OF THE TIME IS WHEN THE word is preached, we look at ourselves for the manifestation. We look at the flesh AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BETTER the flesh. And let me tell you this, you will never perfect the flesh. What you need to DO IS APPLY THE WORD TO YOUR HEART AND LET YOUR HEART PRODUCE THE LIFE THAT WOULD TAKE THE FLESH UNDER SUBJECTION. &gt;&gt; That's the PROCESS OF GOD. WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, WE ARE CALLED TO BE A BRIDE. AND I KNOW I SAID THE ONLY WAY I CAN PRODUCE A BRIDE IS TO DIE WITH MY own self. JUST LIKE ABRAHAM, GOD IS WAITING FOR US TO DIE WITHIN OUR OWN IDEAS. He's waiting FOR YOU TO DIE WITH YOUR OWN THOUGHTS AND YOUR OWN STRENGTH. HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO look at YOURSELF AND SAY, "LORD, YOU SAID THIS AND I KNOW WITHIN MY OWN SELF, THERE'S NO WAY I CAN ATTAIN TO THIS." AND HE looks at you AND HE SAID, "THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WANT YOU TO BE. GOD IS NOT LOOKING FOR A BUNCH of uh uh stronger PEOPLE THAT WILL GO AND DO. HE'S LOOKING FOR THE WEAKEST AMONG US. ONE WHO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER. ONE WHO CAN COME AND GO ON AND HE SAID, "LORD, IF YOU DON'T HELP ME, I'M LOST." &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO THAT ONE. THAT'S THE MATERIAL IS GOING TO WORK WITH. AND THEREFORE WITHIN OUR OWN HEART WHEN THE WORD IS PREACHED WE HAVE TO TAKE IT AND APPLY IT TO OUR HEART AND SAY LORD YOU CALLING ME TO A HIGHER CALLING. YOU CALLING ME TO A BETTER LIFE. YOU CALLING ME TO WHATEVER. LET YOUR WORD FIX THE error into my life. LET ME SAY THIS. ONCE YOU'VE COME IN CONTACT WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. &gt;&gt; Nobody has to ask you to come to church. YOU WILL COME TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; NOBODY HAS TO ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING. YOU'LL DO IT. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER ABOUT SOME REGULATION. IT'S A HEARTBEAT DESIRE THAT WANTS TO PLEASE GOD WITH everything within you. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of Christian I WANT TO BE. NOT ONE THAT'S BORN BY REGULATION. THAT'S WHY I'M SAID THIS. HE SAID WHEN GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE, BECAUSE EVE WAS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL, GOD PLACED HER TO HER FOR HER TO be behind the word. So, HE GAVE HER THE WORD FOR PROTECTION. AND I BEGAN TO THINK EVEN our own self. THE REASON WHY WE FIND IT HARD to live the life of Christ IS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE WHY THE WORD WAS GIVEN. BUT IF WE CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND IT'S FOR OUR PROTECTION. IT'S FOR OUR GOOD. IT'S NOT TO HURT US BUT IT'S TO PROSPER US. AND HE CAME AND HE SAID BUT SHE FOUND THE WAY BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT ONE WITH THAT WORD. SHE FOUND THE WAY. THE ENEMY FOUND THE WAY TO COME AROUND the word and deceive her. BUT SAID, "BUT WHEN GOD BUILT THE SECOND MASTERPIECE, SHE WAS NOT BEHIND THE WORD, BUT SHE WAS MADE THE WORD ITSELF." &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE SHE BECAME THE WORD ITSELF, THERE WAS NO WAY HE COULD DECEIVE IT. WHY? BECAUSE HER THINKING WAS THE WORD. HER SPEECH WAS THE WORD. EVERYTHING ABOUT HER WAS THE WORD. AND IF GOD CANNOT FAIL, SHE CANNOT FAIL ALSO. We we we find it hard because when we hear the word of God and we we try to apply it and we find it, oh, how am I going to I need a better way for me to be to make it to church. I need to do this. Let me say this as a word of advice. Commit it to the Lord. Let your word, let your heart be known unto him and let him make a way of escape for you. &gt;&gt; If you try to make your own way of escape, you will only come up with a disaster. But you utilize his word of escape, which is his word. You take his word back to him and he said, "Lord, YOU SAID THIS. YOU SAID WHEN THE HOUSE OF GOD IS OPEN, I SHOULD BE THERE." YOU SAID THAT THE JUST SHALL NOT BREAK BREAD. YOU USE HIS WORD AND GO BACK TO HIM. THAT WORD WILL OPEN UP A WAY OF ESCAPE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; We can certainly say it's not by OUR OWN DESIRE. I DIDN'T DESIRE TO become a preacher. I've said it time and time again. IT WASN'T BECAUSE IT WAS AND IN FACT I HATED IT. I I hated IT WITH PASSION. I I WAS NO FRIENDS WITH PREACHERS. SEE THE YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT GOD'S DESIRE IS STRONGER THAN OUR EVEN OUR OWN DESIRE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SIT THERE YOU SAY I WANT TO BE A CHRISTIAN BUT SAID GOD WANTS TO BLESS YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN EVER DESIRED. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT ABOUT I LOVE WHAT OUR BROTHER MATTHEW SAID OUR HEART IS A DECEITFUL THING. THE HEART WILL MAKE AN EXCUSE. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; OH, I I I WANT TO DO THIS, BUT THEN THIS, BUT THEN NO, HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ALL OF THAT. HE WANTS YOU TO ACCEPT THE WORD AND LET HIM MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. &gt;&gt; A TRUE BELIEVER, GOD MAKES THE DIFFERENCE FOR WHAT WE CAN. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE WEAK, HE'S MADE STRONG. WHEN WE FAIL, HE CAN LIFT US UP. WHERE WE WE'RE SICK, HE CAN MAKE US WHOLE. HE'S THERE TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. HE'S NOT THERE TO CONDEMN US. HE'S THERE SO HE CAN TAKE YOU. SO YOU CAN KNOW LIKE ABRAHAM AND SARAH, I'M HOLDING THIS BABY, BUT I'M DEAD. THIS BABY IS THE PRODUCT of God giving me life &gt;&gt; and not by my own self. So the same way with Mary, he will come and he said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and it will come to pass and it will talk and by the mouth of Isaiah, God will speak his word and said, "A virgin shall conceive." And Mary will LOOK AND SAID, "HOW SHALL THIS BE?" And the angel will speak unto him and say, "Behold thy handmmaids." It said, it said, "The Holy Spirit shall overshadow thee, and you shall become the one that will bear the the child of the Almighty." And she will look at it, however crazy it sounded. She will lift up her hands and say, "Be unto me according to thy word." I IT'S NOT BY STRENGTH. IT'S BY SURRENDER. IT'S NOT BY WHAT WE CAN OFFER. IT'S BY SURRENDERING TO HIM. IT'S BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE WORD IS RIGHT. IT'S BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE WORD IS TRUE. IT'S BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE KNOWS THE WAY WE DON'T. IT'S BY SURRENDERING TO HIM AND TAKING HIS PROVIDED WAY THAT WE get to what we want, what we need. So the prophet was speaking. For the purpose of time, I'll just try to to to shrink this up really quickly and and you can go back and look at it and and and read it and find it more expanded in the message. The the the word made flesh when we we understand that it's God's desire. But says even from the beginning it was always God wanted to become human. &gt;&gt; He said he wanted to have a family. God wanted to be a family man FROM THE BEGINNING. HE NEVER HE WANTED TO SHARE HIS GLORY with his people. HE NEVER WANTED TO BE ONE THAT SEATED ON THE THRONE and and and with ANGEL WORSHIPING HIM. THAT WAS WONDERFUL. BUT HE WANTED TO HAVE ONE THAT WAS OVER EVEN MORE LIKE HIM HIMSELF MANIFESTED AND THAT WAS ALWAYS HIS DESIRE. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT IN VIEW OF THAT WE WILL SAY THAT WE WE HAVE A PROPHECY IN THE END TIME THAT WE ARE CALLED TO BE THE CHILDREN AND THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. And I just want to read some of the things THAT THE PROPHET TALKED ABOUT BECOMING IN the hour that we are living in. HE SAYS CHRIST IS THE word and the word is in the bride. How many believe the word is in the bride? &gt;&gt; The bride is continuous is the continuation of the same word that was made flesh in Christ. &gt;&gt; WE WE WE ARE NOT TO BE CALLED TO BE A DIFFERENT WORD BUT THE SAME WORD THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN CHRIST. THE SAME WORD THAT WALKED IN IN IN ON THE ROADS OF GALILEE. THE SAME WORD THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN THE BODY OF FLESH CALLED JESUS. THAT SAME WORD, WE ARE THE CONTINUATION OF THAT SAME WORD. &gt;&gt; NO DIFFERENCE. THE SAME WORD IS TO BE MANIFESTED. SO JUST AS CHRIST WAS MADE, THE WORD MADE FLESH IN HIS DAY. SO THE BRIDE BECOME THE LIVING EXPRESSION OF THAT SAME WORD TODAY. the same living EXPRESSION &gt;&gt; WITH THE SAME POWER &gt;&gt; WITH THE SAME HUMILITY with the same nature. Let me SAY THIS MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER WE HAVE NOT COME TO SOME CUNNINGLY DEVICES WE'VE COME TO THE REALITY OF THE LIVING GOD. IF THE WORD HAS TO BE MANIFESTED IN THIS AGE, THE PROMISE IS THAT IT WILL PRODUCE THE FULLNESS, &gt;&gt; NOT HALFWAY, THE FULLNESS OF WHAT GOD WAS. But I just gave you the formula. It's not you. It's him doing it. &gt;&gt; SO, SO DON'T DON'T FEEL SHY. DON'T DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF. JUST ACCEPT IT AND LET HIM BRING THE RESULT. &gt;&gt; WE ARE TO BE JESUS. IT SAYS JESUS IS THE WORD MADE FLESH. And as he WAS FIRST IN HIS SO THE BRIDE IS TO BE THE LIVING EXPRESSION OF THAT SAME WORD TODAY, NOT A DIFFERENT DAY. THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST. BUT WHEN WILL SAY GOD ABOVE US, GOD WITH US IN THE FORM OF JESUS CHRIST AND IN THE END TIME SAID THAT HE WAS TO POUR OUT OF HIMSELF. AND SAYS TO POUR, IT WAS NOT AN EMPTYING OUT, BUT IT'S GOD CHANGING THE FORM. &gt;&gt; GOD CHANGING FORMS. GOD INSTEAD OF JUST A MAN JESUS CHRIST, HE'S TAKEN THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM, POURED INTO A PEOPLE THAT CAN BECOME JUST LIKE HIM, &gt;&gt; TALK LIKE HIM, WALK LIKE HIM, BEHAVE LIKE HIM, &gt;&gt; THE TROUBLE WITH US IS WE LOOK FOR POWER, WE LIVE THE LIFE OUT. YOU TAKE THE LIFE, THE LIFE WILL PRODUCE THE POWER. She carries his nature, his life, his spirit, NO IMITATION, BUT THE true manifestation. Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEN THOSE THAT WERE MET FORTH that came out of Pentecost, when they looked at them, it wasn't because they cut their beards like Jesus did and they they had the same haircut that Jesus did and it wasn't because they talked the same way and, you know, they move the same way or or preach perhaps the same way THAT JESUS PREACHED. NO, IT WAS THE MANIFESTED LIFE THAT CAME OUT OF THEM WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THEM. THE WAY THEY CONDUCTED THEMSELVES, THEY LOOKED AT THEM AND THEY KNEW that these have been with Christ. &gt;&gt; And if WE WERE TO RECEIVE THAT SAME LIFE IN THE END TIME, IT'S NOT BY HOW WE LOOK. IT'S NOT BY WHERE WE COME FROM, BUT IT'S BY THE SAME LIFE LIVING INSIDE OF US manifesting the same Christ. THE WHOLE THERE'S THE WHOLE THE WHOLE OF THIS IS BUT SAY IT'S GOD ALL OF THIS THE TOTALITY OF this it's God's desire to become tangible. &gt;&gt; God becoming tangible. &gt;&gt; God making himself visible. &gt;&gt; What did he say? He said uh not so long he said the world shall see me no more but ye shall see me because I live it shall live also because I will be with you even in you until the end. Andam says at that day ye shall know THAT THE SAME WAY I AM IN THE FATHER AND THE FATHER IN I THAT ME AND THE FATHER WILL COME AND DWELL IN YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The oneness of Christ, &gt;&gt; us becoming one with the word. &gt;&gt; And and let me say this, it's by humility. It's by the life of Christ manifesting itself. &gt;&gt; I just realized we won't be we won't be able to go too far. The true anointed one of the end time, our word born, word living bride. Now because remember when he preaches anointed one in the end times he said that the anointing can fall on the just and the unjust but the word seed will bring forth life. Amen. &gt;&gt; The difference was one will produce the very life. The other even though it was anointed, it will come forth. It will produce signs and wonders and all of this. BUT THE THE THE DIFFERENCE WAS by the fruits you shall know them. ONE WAS FOCUSED ON LIFE. THE OTHER WAS produce was focused on sign and wonders. THAT'S WHY MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, AS BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE, WHAT WE DESIRE IS THE VERY LIFE OF Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Whether you produce a sign or not, &gt;&gt; WHAT WE DESIRE IS THE LIFE. What we DESIRE IS FOR THE SAME LIFE TO BE MANIFESTED. MANY ANOINTED, BUT THOSE BORN BY THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD WILL carry the true life of Christ. THE EVIDENCE OF THE SPIRIT ISN'T SENSATION BUT STAYING WITH THE word that is given. &gt;&gt; AND NOW DON'T FORGET THE WORD IS NOT WITHOUT A REPROACH. &gt;&gt; I I I didn't read it but if you read in Galatians he says now the it says that it talks about the children of the bond woman and the free. IT SAYS THE BOND WOMAN HAS A LOT OF CHILDREN, BUT THE FREE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE ONE. SO YOU LOOK AT A BOND WOMAN IS ABLE TO PROSPER AND DO ALL OF THIS, BUT THE CHILDREN OF THE FREE, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S TAKING LONGER. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LOT OF WORK. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT COMING. BUT MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, THAT'S WHY WE DON'T COMPARE OURSELVES WITH ANYBODY ELSE. I I DESIRE I I I I WANT WHAT GOD HAS IN PORTION FOR ME. &gt;&gt; I WANT WHAT GOD HAS IN STORE FOR ME. I WANT SOMETHING THAT CAN CHANGE MY LIFE. I WANT SOMETHING THAT GOD PROMISED THAT HAS MY NAME ON IT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IF I TRY TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY ELSE, I'LL ONLY END UP WITH IMITATION. I'LL ONLY END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL ONLY SATISFY FOR A LITTLE BIT. BUT WHEN YOU RECEIVE THAT WHICH COMES FROM HIM, YOU ARE SATISFIED FOREVER. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE, LET ME SAY THIS, IS TO BE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. &gt;&gt; THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL AGE. THE BRIDE IS THE VERY MOUTHPIECE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Now that's scary. I I and I I wonder if we and and I'm sure we know all of this thing, but do we let them just wash over us? &gt;&gt; Do we mind ourselves? You know, when when you lose your job, when your child is sick, when things seems like they're not just going right, do you do you actually take a minute to remind yourself of what you are really called to be? or do you panic and call 911 and and move around and lose it? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M SPEAKING THIS SO WE COULD BE REMINDED. IT'S NOT BY OUR STRENGTH, BUT IT'S BY THE WORD. Let me say this. JESUS WAS WHO HE WAS BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT SAYS HE BELIEVED WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; AND I'LL READ IT. HOW MANY BELIEVE JESUS WAS PREDESTINATED? AMEN. &gt;&gt; You believe that? BUT SAYS THE SAME AS HE WAS PREDESTINATED, YOU ARE predestinated also. &gt;&gt; SO DON'T ATTACH SOME TYPE OF POWER TO JESUS THAT YOU DON'T GOT. &gt;&gt; THE SAME WORD THAT SPOKE OF THE BRIDE SPEAKS OF THE BRIDEGROOM. &gt;&gt; SCARY. I told you it's going to get scary. BUTAM SAYS IT IT IT WASN'T JESUS DIDN'T RAISE HIMSELF UP. GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD. AND IT SAYS THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD WHEN HE DWELLS IN YOU IT WILL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY. SO LET ME SAY THIS THE SAME WHAT WE NEED IS THE SAME ATTITUDE THAT WAS IN JESUS THAT HE LOOKED THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE TAUGHT IT NOT ROBBERY TO BE EQUAL WITH GOD BUT HE BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID IF HE BELIEVE ALL THAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT HIM COULD WE ALSO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT us &gt;&gt; we we we have such a habit to make oursel lesser &gt;&gt; you KNOW LIKE WHAT WHATEVER IT IS WE FIND A WAY &gt;&gt; TO MAKE IT lesser &gt;&gt; to make it less effective less enticing not enticing for no LESS ATTRACTIVE LESS POWERFUL LESS WHATEVER LESS WHATEVER NO IT SAID IT THE SAME WORD THAT SPEAKS OF THE bride speaks of THE BRIDEGROOM IN FACT SAID WHEN HE DIED ON THE CROSS, YOU WERE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; IT SAID THE REASON WHY YOU WERE WITH HIM AND WHEN HE DIED, YOU WERE INSIDE OF HIM. WHEN HE WAS PUNCTURED, YOU CAME OUT. In this closing this translation, God speaks only through the body. The same life that was in the head. And this is me speaking because remember we live in the union time. We live in the invisible union. Barbanam says the word has come to connect it to the body. So the life that was in the head, that life also is in the body to manifest the same works. THE SAME LIFE, THE same blood that was in the head has moved into the body to make it alive, to make it move. That's why he SAYS SHE DOESN'T SPEAK OUTSIDE OF HIM SPEAKING. IN OTHER WORD, MY BODY TAKES IT TAKES A CUE FROM THE HEAD. WHEN THE HEAD SAYS DOES THIS, IT DOES. WHEN MY THE HEAD SAID DO THIS, IT DOES. WHY? YOU BECOME CONNECTED TO HIM AND YOU TAKE ALL OF YOUR instruction from him. &gt;&gt; The bride becomes the word. &gt;&gt; The voice of the bridegroom is in the bride form. The manifestation of Christ in the end time. He says Christ is in the bride form. It says what was what was once in the head has now come into the body. It's Christ again making himself known into the bride form. Did he say not that the manifestation of in the end time will be in the bride form? He says in the formation of the bride. WHO WAS IT? HE WAS SPEAKING OF YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Now remember, I don't have the quote here, but he speaks about the son of man. He said that it's when we receive the word of God, when we take the word of God as it is spoken and we believe it, he says that word will manifest the son of man again. Every time, every time you believe and take the word and apply it, it's bound to manifest the son of man. THE MYSTERY OF GOD, CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF glory is the complete of of is the completeness of himself. The bride and the bridegrooms are one. The same spirit, the same purpose. He says we are called for to separate from all the things of the world. Now if if I I'll say this, you have to desire these things. &gt;&gt; There has to be and I want to say this. We we not just what we claim to be, but our lives is the manifestation of who we are. you you there has to be something in your heart that desire the things that we are speaking about to come to pass into your life. &gt;&gt; THIS CANNOT BE SOME TYPE of intellectual understanding or relationship where we memorize those things and we are fine with them. NO, THE REASON WHY YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN, LET ME ASK THIS. WHY WOULD GOD OPEN YOUR EYES FOR this age? So you can just say you know God sent a messenger. No. &gt;&gt; NO. IF GOD OPENED YOUR EYES IN THIS AGE IS SO THAT YOU CAN SEE the deception that's happening. IS SO THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE THAT WHICH IS GIVEN FOR THIS AGE. IS SO THAT YOU CAN BECOME AN OVERCOMER IN THIS AGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT IF WE ARE ONLY SATISFIED WITH THE FACT THAT OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN WITHOUT THE LIFE, HOW WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT BE? OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR A PURPOSE OF GOING IN AND EATING OF THE FRUITS OF THE LAND. &gt;&gt; OUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF PRODUCING THE LIFE. SO THAT THAT'S WHY I SAID WHEN WE FIND THE LACKING, WE WE HAVE TO APPLY THE WORD BECAUSE THE WORD IS THE ONLY THING THAT CORRECTS THE ERROR. &gt;&gt; I IT'S NOT SOMEBODY TELLING YOU YOU GOT TO DRESS LIKE THIS, YOU GOT TO DO THIS. Let me tell you this. If you DO IT BECAUSE BROTHER DAVID said it, &gt;&gt; you're not going to go too far. &gt;&gt; No. If you do it because brother Matthew said it, it's not going to be helpful. &gt;&gt; It's good, but it's not going to be helpful. &gt;&gt; BUT MY WHEN YOU STRUCK YOU BY REVELATION, WHEN SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOUR HEART WANTS TO OBEY THE WORD OF GOD, MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER, THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES LIFE. THAT'S WHEN THE WORD IS MADE FLESH. &gt;&gt; THE WORD MADE FLESH IS GOD MANIFESTED IN YOUR HUMAN BEING. So we he says THAT EVERY MOVE OF GOD produces twins can enable and Esau and Jacob and and so forth. We have to separate from everything that's not the word of God &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PART OF SATAN TACTIC is to keep us distracted to keep us in a position where we fail to come into the fullness. Remember the parable of the seed when the seed fell FORTH THERE WAS THOSE THAT FELL ON THE WAY SIDE AND AND THOSE THAT fell on the rock and everything. THE THE WHAT WAS LACKING WAS THAT THAT THE SEED DIDN'T FALL IN THE GROUND THAT WAS FERTILE ENOUGH TO SWALLOW IT UP AND TO LET MOISTURE AND EVERYTHING SO IT PRODUCED THE FULLNESS OF WHAT HE WAS CALLED. SO WHAT ALWAYS CAUSES THE PROBLEM IS OUR INABILITY TO STAY WITH THE WORD OF GOD TO STAY IN FOCUS AND LET HIM MAKE IT HAPPEN for you. We'll go here and we'll see and we'll get prayed for and we feel like we're doing good and and couple of weeks later we feel like &gt;&gt; oh I need it again. &gt;&gt; You you'll go for a year or two and you'll you you'll come from A CAMP MEETING AND FEELING LIKE THE LORD HAS REALLY DONE FOR YOU A LOT AND THEN YOU COME AND AFTER A WHILE YOU FEEL LIKE you lost it again. So your Christianity becomes connected to your feelings. &gt;&gt; Is that the truth? Your Christianity becomes directly connected on how you feel that day. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Wouldn't that be miserable? &gt;&gt; It it depends on your mood. You It depends on whether you feel accepted or not. And and let me just tell you this. God didn't leave it up to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nope. &gt;&gt; He made a way. And when it all said and done, you will get there. &gt;&gt; If he has to drag you, he will drag you. If he has to take you and lay you flat, he will. WHEN ALL IS SAID and done, it will happen exactly as he promised it will do. &gt;&gt; God is never going TO FAIL. HIS WORD WILL NOT RETURN FOR IT. BUT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS WHEN HE'S SPOKEN IT, IT WILL NOT RETURN FOR IT UNTIL HE FULFILLED THAT WHICH HE HAS spoken it for. &gt;&gt; Let me just continue for the sake of time. So we have to recognize the message of the time that we are living in. IF IF YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE the message of your time, you'll miss it just like the Pharisees did. They came in their day and they looked at Jesus and fulfilling every word. In fact, to him looking at them and says, "Search the scriptures for it speaks of me." It says, "If you can't believe me for my words, believe me for my works because they're one and the same. They're manifesting that I'm speaking to you the things which were spoken of me." So in every age, God has a message of restoration by the word of God. The bride is identifi identifies a groom by the word revealed through the prophecy. In fact, Barbanam said in in one place, if I could just skip, it says that only the elect will be able to see the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Only the elect will be able to see the word made flesh. When the word becomes flesh, it's only given to those elected people to see it. So if we take that statement, we can agree all of us tonight that just the fact that your eyes have been open to see it makes you a special person. &gt;&gt; You understand? SO THEN WHY STOP THERE? &gt;&gt; WHY STOP THERE? YOUR EYES HAVE BEEN OPEN TO SEE IT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST CONTINUE? HE DIDN'T OPEN IT SO YOU CAN JUST STAY THERE AND SAY, "THANK GOD FOR MALACHI 4." NO. MALACHI 4 DID HIS JOB AND THERE'S A JOB LEFT FOR YOU TO DO. &gt;&gt; MALACHI 4 FULFILL HIS PART AND YOU GOT A PART TO FULFILL THE SAME WORD. THE SAME WAY WAS MADE MANIFEST IN MALACHI 4. THAT SAME WORD IS HERE TO BE MADE MANIFESTED IN YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Vindicated by the spirit of God and the word together. If the same spirit, it's the same spirit and it's the it's the spirit and the word together that makes the manifestation. The true anointed aligned perfectly with the word. The bride doesn't speak her own ideas. You know, let me just read this. I was going to say something, but let me just read this. But when I will say in the message, the word becoming flesh or the the word become flesh preach in India trip. He says now he tells us it tells us it says paragraph 170 he says that before there was a man before there was before in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was with God and the word was made flesh it says now it says just about as far as human mind can go that's as far as we can go back now in the beginning is that Right. It says, "In the beginning was the word, but he says, but now that's as far as you can go by theology." I love that the theologian can only come and stop right here at the beginning of the book. When they read the first text says, "In the beginning, God created and the word was with God." They stop right there. [snorts] They they cannot go past that. But listen to what he says. It says that it says that's how far we can go by our mind. But revelation carries us beyond that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I SAY IT'S NOT BY YOUR FLESH. FORGET YOUR FLESH. I'M NOT HERE PREACHING TO YOUR FLESH. YOUR FLESH WILL BE BROUGHT UNDER SUBJECTION. THE TROUBLE WITH US IS WE WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT OUR FLESH. OH, MY FLESH IS THIS, MY FLESH IS THAT. FORGET ABOUT IT. DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO IT. FEED THE SOUL. FEED THE WORD. AND THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE WORD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD WILL KILL YOUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; The trouble is what I spoke about. We we we we give so much leniency to our flesh, right? We keep it in contact with so many things and then we wonder why we are troubled. &gt;&gt; WE FEED THE BLACK DOG EVERY MINUTE. &gt;&gt; WE GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE CRIES OUT FOR AND we wonder why we have trouble. &gt;&gt; FEED YOUR SOUL AND WATCH WHAT IT WILL PRODUCE. &gt;&gt; FEED YOUR SOUL AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT IT WILL PRODUCE. YOU EAT THE WORD, THERE'S NO WAY YOU WON'T PRODUCE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU STAY WITH THE WORD. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. AND THIS IS WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING. YOU DON'T YOU KNOW IT. YOU GET IN CERTAIN PLACES AND EVERYTHING. ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING AND ALARM GOES OFF. IT SAYS, "I WON'T BE HERE. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE. I'M GOING OUT OF HERE." &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING INSIDE of you THAT WILL TELL YOU THIS IS NOT OKAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But if you worry about this, oh, I don't want Brother Matthew to see me here. &gt;&gt; Right. I I don't want anybody from the church to see me. That's the wrong approach. &gt;&gt; That that that's just human flesh, right? So then how about God? Do you care about him seeing you? Do you care about him looking at your heart? &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. IT'S A IS A SACREDNESS INSIDE OF THE HEART. SOMETHING THAT WANTS TO LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT WANTS TO OBEY THE WORD OF GOD. SOMETHING THAT BEATS THE WORD OF GOD INSIDE OF YOUR HEART. THAT'S WHAT WILL PRODUCE THE RESULT. &gt;&gt; So he says now he says I'll just teach something on the theology. You think in the beginning was the word and the words was and the word was uh and that word was God and the word was God. That's right. At the same was made flesh and dwelt among us and then God was made flesh without controversy. That's true. God was made flesh. We believe that. But now THERE WAS THAT WORD. IT SAYS WHAT IS A WORD? A word is the manifestation of a thought. It says is expression OF A THOUGHT. HE SAID, "IS THAT RIGHT? BEFORE YOU SAY anything subconsciously, you think of it before YOU SPEAK IT." IS THAT RIGHT? HE SAYS, HE continues on. He says, "UH, NOW, SO IN THE BEGINNING was the word." IT SAYS THAT'S AS FAR AS WE CAN GO BACK BY THIS. We're speaking of book BY THEOLOGY. BUT BEFORE THE WORD WAS BEFORE THAT WORD WAS, it was A THOUGHT. AND THE THOUGHT WAS MADE MANIFEST. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, YOU COME DIRECTLY FROM THE THOUGHTS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE HE'S WANTING YOU TO KNOW YOU. THAT'S WHY WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, WE HAVE TO GO PAST OUR MIND, OUR THINKING, OUR REALIZATION, OUR EVERYTHING. WE HAVE TO BE LIFTED UP IN HEAVENLY PLACES TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH HE'S SPEAKING ABOUT. YOU YOU THAT'S WHY THE MIND OF CHRIST HAS TO BE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; WE WE CANNOT APPROACH THE WORD OF GOD AND SUBJECT IT TO OUR HUMAN MIND AND REASONING. WE WILL COME OUT LIKE NICODEMUS. &gt;&gt; You shall be born again. H how shall this be? How h how can a grown-up like me return back into my mother's womb and be born again? &gt;&gt; And we say that's Nicodemus. We do it all the time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; WE DO IT EVERY DAY. THE WORD SAID BE PERFECT. HOW AM I GOING TO BE PERFECT? He who said be perfect has made a way for you to be perfect. ALL WE NEED TO SAY IS, "FATHER, YOU CALL ME TO BE PERFECT. PROVIDE WHAT I NEED TO BE PERFECT. I'M HERE AS YOUR HANDMADE. LET IT BE UNTO ME ACCORDING [screaming] TO THY WORD. YOU CALL PERFECTION. I BELIEVE PERFECTION." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Do not make an excuse. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, your flesh becomes an excuse on why you cannot attain. I I don't have that quote, but I love it so much. But Ram says, "No matter how weak you are, how strong you are, how unable you are," he basically just lists it all, &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Let me even go as further said, "Your desire to become the word was placed in your heart by himself. He places the desire so he can come and fulfill it. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; So he says here in the message I have heard but now I see. He says now I I love this. He he's speaking about the woman that came to wash his feet. Uh the and I want you to just hear says paragraph 174. says her eyes had seen beyond his criticism. &gt;&gt; If you could put it up there. A and I want to use that to say that the the true word has never been without criticism. &gt;&gt; It's okay to be criticized. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; it's okay to be mocked at &gt;&gt; because he was mocked, too. &gt;&gt; It's okay when people look at you and think you're crazy. &gt;&gt; We the the we we want to be liked by everybody. &gt;&gt; It's never going to happen. &gt;&gt; What we want is to be liked by him. &gt;&gt; You with me? What you want is to BE THE IMAGE OF WHAT HE DESIRE. Whatever he's pleased with, that's good enough with me. &gt;&gt; SO SHE LOOKED, SHE HER eyes had seen beyond the his criticism. He says she believed he was see the word of the prophets. And now I want you now to think about this woman, to think about yourself, and to think about the message of the hour and what it came to produce. So it says she knowed that that WAS ALL THE WORD of the prophets was vindicated in him. She had heard he was on earth, but now she sees him. Watch what she done. She seen the word made flesh, THE MESSIAH, the Emmanuel, when she gave vent to HER PULSATION OF faith of REVELATION OF HE WAS of who HE WAS IN THAT TIME SHE WAS LIVING IN THAT HE WAS GOD'S LAMB FOR such sinner. And she was as she was, she went forth to serve him, to serve his needs without knowing how she would do it. Let me tell you, that's the formula to obtain whatever you have need of. My eyes have been open to see that this message is a reality. I have seen the word made flesh in my generation. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO IT, but I am going to serve his needs. &gt;&gt; I AM GOING TO LAY MYSELF DOWN SO THAT I CAN BE USED BY HIM. I DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO CHOOSE TO DO IT. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GOING TO DO IT IN THE MORNING OR NIGHT, BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS MESSAGE. I HAVE SEEN HIM OPEN MY EYES. [screaming] I HAVE COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS THE MESSAGE OF MALACHI 4. THEREFORE, I COMMIT MYSELF TO HIM &gt;&gt; that he will take care of my life. &gt;&gt; BUT SAYS THUS THE WAY A GENUINE healing comes. He says when it's revealed that you HE WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSION, bruised for your iniquity, with his STRIPES YOU WERE HEALED. WHEN IT'S INSPIRED TO YOU TO SEE HIS PRESENCE HERE, ST. MARK 11, IT says or or Luke 17 UH 30 THAT HE WAS GOING TO REVEAL HIMSELF IN THE LAST DAY AMONG HIS PEOPLE IS HUMAN FLESH LIKE HE DID BEFORE SODOM. WHEN YOU SEE that &gt;&gt; and something strikes you, &gt;&gt; the doctor says it's cancer still the the cancer is still here. That patient, it says that patient might say, "I I don't know how I'm going to walk, but I'm going to walk anyhow." We don't know how he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; What does it is I realize it's him and how it's going to happen, it's none of my business. &gt;&gt; What matters is my eyes have been open to see Luke 17:30. And because I have seen it, everything else is left in his hands. &gt;&gt; He speaks in the message, the spoken word is the original seed. Paragraph 224, he says, pred predestinated as he was, predestinated. Paragraph 224, [snorts] predestinated as he was, makes the word seed flesh in you. his church, God's word. &gt;&gt; You say, "Sure, brother Bam. Every word I believe, then don't back up." It says, "Don't back up when your tradition when you get Don't back up when you get your tradition. Stay right with that word. Stay with that. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. &gt;&gt; And and and I want to say this, part of our challenge is we we want a a a quick Christianity, right? Like one that just happens overnight. Like today I'm a sinner and tomorrow I'm the manifested son, right? You know what I mean? Like today I'm a sinner and tomorrow I'm lifting I'm I'm raising the dead and fixing everything. It's a teaching. &gt;&gt; It takes the tutor. It takes the tutor to continually walk with you and show you. There's so many things that you learn along the way. There's so many he he will give you as much as he desire to &gt;&gt; and it's not to be compared one with another. But says the new birth is the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's the very foundation on which which he wants you to stand. I It's him continually manifesting and working his life in you so you can produce what he desires. So it says and watch what IT SAYS. OH LORD, I believe this. Send your Holy Spirit. Watch this. IT SAYS, "THEN WATCH if then watch if he goes to bear record, then you know you got it." It says, it says not by some sensation, the devil do that. Not by some miracles, the devil do that. But by your constant belief in the word of God and the life that you live, never never denying nothing. All right? That makes the word becoming flesh. See, flesh and the same water spirit. What about my sister? It's the word that produces the result. &gt;&gt; And I love what he said. When you believe the word, the spirit of God is bound to come and make that word a reality to you. &gt;&gt; Our trouble is we fail to associate the word and the spirit. The word, the spirit is what makes the word alive. But when says it in I believe rising of the sun or the the the other message it says it says it takes the word he quickens it. We we we hold on to THE WORD AND GOD QUICKENS THE word so we can know that his word is a reality. if the musician could come. He said in the message here, it says, "And when the word of God is put into a fertile ground of his inspired believer, he produces just exactly what God said he would do." &gt;&gt; Amen. because it can't fail. &gt;&gt; It's God's eternal word. God, it says it's got to waken the people. God to bring us to something when the word is received. And it says when that's in what's then what that's what's in the inspiration. It says, "And man into a con in no condition outside of repentance." It says that he it says he's no condition to receive the word until first he has been inspired. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, are you are you inspired tonight? I is there an identification in your heart tonight? Is there something? Because the word that was made flesh in Jesus, we have a promise that that word has to be made flesh in us again. He promised that the fullness of who he is by the invisible union will be made flesh unto us. He promised that in the end time as we just read but when I'm speaking and they said that that word must come into manifestation again if I could just read it in closing he says in the message the seed is not heir with the shot paragraph 100 it says but when the seed was delivered he said I come to do the will of of him that sent me I and my father are one I do nothing I do not his I says I do not his works. Believe me, if I do not his work, believe me not. It says there was the seed which was one which was one of you can who can condemn me of unbelief. But what the Bible has promised I will do. I CAN DO IT. GOD HAS VERIFIED THAT through me. He says he said he can tell me now. He said, "But the seed in Mary, the shock, it was close to being that, but it wasn't. It was still in the womb." Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Notice now, notice. And in the Pentecostal age, through the Lutheran age and through the wrestling's age, and it it's been the same thing through the Pentecostal age, it says, "Now notice, but in at the opening of the seal, seven seals, Revelation 10, the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth manifesting the manifested in the same way doing the same thing that he did when he was here on earth. Amen. Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever. In St. Luke 17 and30 JESUS SAID IN THAT IN THE LAST DAY THAT AS I AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF SODOM WHEN THE SON OF MAN WILL BE REVEALED HIMSELF AGAIN IT will be the same thing. [snorts] What is it? It's the full word of God coming into manifestation. NOW THE FULL WORD CAN COME CANNOT COME INTO manifestation with a bunch of likings WITH A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS WITH A BUNCH OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T KNOW IS THIS THE WORD OR NO THE FULL WORD COMES IN MANIFESTATION WITH THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN CHRIST MANIFESTED IN THE people &gt;&gt; my brother and my sister we are not forsaken we are called into the fold what we need is to be strengthened by the word of God to understand that what we have received it's not the words of man it's the words of GOD THIS IS GOD'S PROMISE for you in the end time that HE WOULD MANIFEST HIMSELF IN THE FULLNESS OF WHO HE was &gt;&gt; in his church that the church will be his name that the church will bear his name will will carry his name that the church WILL DO THE SAME WORKS THAT HE DID WHY WOULD THAT BE BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME GOD MANIFESTING HIMSELF AGAIN. &gt;&gt; But if we think, "Oh, I can't do it." And and I'm lacking here and I'm lacking there and and my question is, what are you looking at? &gt;&gt; Are you looking at the one who spoke it? Or are you looking at your flesh? Are you looking at your own effort? Are you looking at the one that spoke it? HE THAT SPAKETH, THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD, IF HE DWELLS IN YOU, HE'LL ALSO QUICKEN YOUR MORTAL BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE TO QUICKEN THE WORD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROCESS OF QUICKENING IT TAKES FOR YOU TO EAT THE WORD AND STAY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SON IN ORDER FOR YOU TO MANIFEST IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's not fail short of what we've been called to. Let let's not come to a place where we let the cares of life overtake us, but let's WALK WITH OUR HEAD HELD HIGH. LET'S KNOW THERE'S A PROMISE IN STORE FOR US. AND BROTHER SAYS IT'S THE INFALLIBLE WORD OF HIS PROMISE. WHEN GOD MAKES A PROMISE, THERE'S NO WAY THAT PROMISE CAN FAIL. IF JESUS CAME AND MANIFESTED HIMSELF AND HE WAS THE WORD MADE FLESH, YOU WILL BECOME THE WORD MADE FLESH TODAY. YOU WILL DO THE SAME THING THAT HE DID. JUST LIKE JESUS NEVER FAILED. YOU CANNOT FAIL. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, it will be a contradiction. &gt;&gt; But now it's not done in boastful. &gt;&gt; It's done in the life of Christ living inside of people. Let me ask you this and this is part of the some of the things it's important that we know whenever you think about the life of Christ you need to ask yourself a question when th life was in Christ what did he do what did thy life produce &gt;&gt; because those are the things that you need to measure All you looked in you to be manifested. The scripture says the life that was in him he lived not for himself he lived for others. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The the life that was in him, he did nothing except what the father showed him. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM, he took it and he laid it down. so others could see and come. My question to you, are you LAYING YOUR LIFE DOWN SO OTHERS can also come? Or are we looking for a life where we never make a mistake and we are so perfect and everybody is below us? That's not the kind of LIFE HE THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM, THEY CALL HIM a friend of sinners. You with me? THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM. HE WENT and he found the MAN ON THE TREE AND CALLED UH ZAKIUS AND SAID, "ZAKIUS, COME DOWN. TODAY I'M GOING TO EAT AT YOUR HOUSE." &gt;&gt; THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOST SEED OF ABRAHAM SO HE CAN BRING THEM BACK IN. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM WAS NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT THE FATHER WANTED. THE LIFE THAT WAS IN HIM KNEW THAT THE FATHER WILL TAKE CARE OF HIM NO MATTER WHAT. &gt;&gt; My question to you is, are you doing the same works? What is the works of Christ to you? Is it to to raise the dead and do great miracles? It's to do that which pleases the father. &gt;&gt; It's the life that's given so we can lay it down for others. It's the life that's given so we can become partakers of divine nature and we can become part of the redemption process [music] for others that others may look and see Christ living in us. Let's all stand. I'll tell you this. If I never have to to do one miracles, I'm fine with it. &gt;&gt; But as long as I can lay my life down and manifest the same life of Christ and AND AND HELP OTHERS THAT THEY MAY SEE THE same life. Healing is part of the atonement. You can never take away from it. DELIVERANCE AND SALVATION ARE ALL GIVEN. BUT WHAT WE DESIRE ABOVE ALL IS THE life to be manifested. WHEN WE HAVE THE LIFE, WE HAVE ALL things because we won't have to worry about what's happening to us. The reason why we get scared AND THINGS GO ASIDE AND WE FEEL LIKE OH we are left out is because we need another measure of life. Father, that I want to be in your care and know that you've taken care of me no matter what happens, which is the life that was in him. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious Father, we're so thankful, Lord, and Lord, desiring that your word be that flesh in us. Father, even when we say it, we we wonder what is our very definition of that. But Lord, your prophet speaks in perfect faith. It says it's to believe everything that the word said [music] about us. That the harmony that was between the father and the son, that same harmony may exist between Christ and his bride. Father, it's always been about the restoration of what was in the beginning. Father, the power to stand against evil. And you would even say that the preaching of the word is the casting out of demons. And Lord, that would take what belongs to us. And but Father, above all, that we will manifest the very nature of who you were. Father, we hunger for that. We hunger that the realities of Jesus Christ may not remain in the book tonight and in the message and but it may actually become part of us Lord that we may be like those in the revival and when people will will come to the Welsh revival and ask and said I want to go to the revival and I want to see where it was and one will stand and say that I am that revival. &gt;&gt; Father, it wasn't a a group effort or a bunch of people just running around, but it was life that were made and changed by the word of God that father whether they were alone or whether they were together, it didn't have any change. But Lord, it was individuals that could go onto the world and preach the gospel and and Father, that they would manifest the life of Christ to a dying generation. Lord, that's what we desire. And we know for certain that we cannot do it by our own self. We ask father that you endure us with the power from on high that the Holy Spirit may come and in each individual here gather here tonight that you would quicken the word that you have placed in us. Father that that quickening power may give us what we have need of in order for us to overcome the challenges of life. Father that it will give us the power to speak and not go back. that he WILL GIVE US WHAT WE HAVE need of in order for us to press forward. Lord, we love you and commit everything we are. And we ask all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Let's just sing now. Oh, and oh you may take. [music] Oh, and one last song and one [music] God.
