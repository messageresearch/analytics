[21:50] I've been enjoying
[21:52] here recently stay I believe we've seen
[21:55] that in the key of E flat
[21:59] and if you've ever been in his presence
[22:03] then you can identify with the song
[22:05] you know one of the greatest moments I I
[22:09] can take you to the place I can
[22:11] the building's been torn down now but I
[22:14] can
[22:15] go right about to the spot where I just
[22:17] remember one of the most intimate times
[22:19] where the Lord coming
[22:20] seemed like I was transported
[22:23] to another world and there was an
[22:26] eternal just fire presence
[22:29] I remember I'd been there quite a
[22:31] sometime they needed to lock up the
[22:33] church and I Heard a Voice just seemed
[22:35] like from a tunnel
[22:37] way far away and I heard it come again
[22:41] it's Matthew
[22:43] well it was my dad calling me back to
[22:46] Earth saying we needed to lock up
[22:49] and I remember in that moment I felt
[22:53] I almost when you come from that place I
[22:56] felt almost let down but I remember my
[22:58] brother David encouraged me and said hey
[23:01] he's with you you can take him wherever
[23:02] you go and I was like well I know that
[23:05] I said but that moment was precious and
[23:07] you know if you ever just desire that if
[23:10] you've never felt that kind of presence
[23:12] I I invite you to sincerely in your
[23:14] heart say you know Lord
[23:16] when I hear songs like that maybe
[23:19] maybe you can't identify with it
[23:22] why don't you get serious before God say
[23:24] you know Lord I've heard this testimony
[23:26] I've heard people talk about being in
[23:28] your presence and maybe you've felt a
[23:30] moving in church but when you're in a
[23:33] prayer closet or all alone somewhere at
[23:36] your bedside and the presence of God
[23:37] comes in
[23:39] there's nothing like it
[23:41] [Music]
[23:49] life
[23:50] [Music]
[23:54] in the presence of the Lord

[30:47] Jesus Christ amen
[30:50] amen so good to be guided once again in
[30:52] the house of God Amen we want to welcome
[30:54] everyone in the house of God Amen let's
[30:58] open our Bibles we'll read and then
[31:00] we'll be seated and then we'll
[31:04] to continue
[31:10] man let's just read one scripture will
[31:12] be seated and then we'll read the next
[31:14] of the others later Jeremiah chapter 17
[31:17] verse 7 and 8.
[31:21] it says
[31:23] blessed is a man that trusted that
[31:25] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope is
[31:28] the Lord is
[31:30] it says for he shall be like a tree
[31:32] planted by By the Waters
[31:35] and that spread it out his root by the
[31:39] river and shall not see when heat cometh
[31:43] but her Leaf shall be green
[31:46] and shall not be careful in the years of
[31:49] drought neither shall cease
[31:52] from yielding fruit let's just bow our
[31:55] heads up father we ask that you brace
[31:57] your word to us we commit everything to
[31:59] your hands and thank you in the name of
[32:00] Jesus Christ amen God bless you and have
[32:03] your seats man it's so good that we
[32:05] Gather in the house of God again we want
[32:06] to welcome everyone and certainly
[32:09] thankful I certainly enjoyed the word
[32:11] this morning
[32:13] hey man I was just thinking as Alberta
[32:15] Matthew was speaking I said you know
[32:17] what we need is not Mo theology what we
[32:21] need is the reality of God in our lives
[32:23] well this word has not been given to us
[32:26] so we could just quote it and and debate
[32:28] about it and and say the prophet said
[32:31] here and you say he said that and all of
[32:33] that no but one day one way or the other
[32:36] as Believers that reality of God's word
[32:40] is going to come to us we I believe this
[32:43] message is an entrance into the kingdom
[32:46] of God is is the way that God has made
[32:49] so we can have fellowship with him is
[32:52] what God has given us in this end time
[32:55] for us to escape the things that are
[32:57] around us amen I so appreciate it
[32:59] because there is nothing more than God
[33:02] above all we could do and say what we
[33:04] want is for the word to come in to touch
[33:07] your life and to actually transform you
[33:09] and make you a son and the daughter of
[33:12] God Amen we certainly appreciate that it
[33:15] certainly also appreciate your prayer
[33:17] for my son is doing better he's sitting
[33:20] back there
[33:21] he's uh
[33:23] he has this sometimes he gets this
[33:25] internal fevers and if you don't pay
[33:28] attention and watch him closely it kind
[33:31] of put him in a state of lethargic or he
[33:34] becomes really tired so but I believe
[33:37] God has given us the victory amen I
[33:40] believe this word is a reality amen I I
[33:43] could stand here and tell testimonies
[33:45] about that son I could say here we don't
[33:47] have enough time and it's even in this
[33:50] very Church while it was still just just
[33:52] few months old
[33:55] I just finished I believe it was brother
[33:57] Aaron I was preaching I just went in the
[33:59] back and all of a sudden my come my wife
[34:02] comes following after me and he has just
[34:05] turned purple or blue whatever you want
[34:07] to call it and it became unresponsive
[34:09] and it just stiffened up and with
[34:11] Brothers came out we prayed and and all
[34:14] of a sudden he came back again and he
[34:16] began to breathe so he's certainly a
[34:18] miracle and I believe it's I believe
[34:20] that you say why do you believe he's
[34:22] healed because God said is hell
[34:25] because the word said is healed I this
[34:27] is not some emotion this is the word of
[34:29] God and and we we we we gather here
[34:33] because we've stake our lives for this
[34:35] word they we don't have any other source
[34:38] of comfort or anything else that we rely
[34:40] on solely God's word so it's we take
[34:44] God's words until we are taken to the
[34:46] Grave it's nothing else but the word of
[34:48] God and we believe because you promise
[34:50] when we believe when we come and believe
[34:52] he's the one who has to make his Worth
[34:54] to come to the past I I thought about
[34:57] this quote I'll just read it before we
[34:59] move on this is in the greatest battle I
[35:01] ever fought Brothers if you could put it
[35:03] up and paragraph 340 I want you to
[35:06] listen to this it says now now watch now
[35:09] it says
[35:10] I just got a hurry he said
[35:13] um it says I got I got I I I got to get
[35:16] this in it says Satan's Army brings
[35:19] distress and I thought even the
[35:21] exhortation of what Mike was bringing
[35:23] this morning and I thought this devil is
[35:26] just he just doesn't know who he's
[35:28] dealing with this is not the the people
[35:31] that would go up in fear this is the
[35:33] children of God this is the people of
[35:36] God so he said Satan's Army brings
[35:38] diseases he says That's what Satan is
[35:41] he's a destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom
[35:44] of Satan is sickness death and sorrow
[35:47] and frustration and worries all on Satan
[35:51] think about that and then he says God is
[35:54] life Faith joy peace over here see it
[35:59] says now now that's that's the two great
[36:02] forces that's coming together right now
[36:05] they are battling now listen to this
[36:07] they are battling right here in this
[36:10] building right now
[36:12] so you you tell me we are gathered in
[36:16] the house of God to hear the word of God
[36:18] but Satan is also here trying to inject
[36:21] his fear his sicknesses his frustration
[36:25] he's trying to do it right here right
[36:27] now
[36:29] and then he says they they they battle
[36:32] day by day with you every force it says
[36:36] Satan following you along that great big
[36:40] it says uh kingly priest Goliath trying
[36:44] to scare the liver out of you yeah yeah
[36:47] it says he's here right but God it says
[36:50] you are fortified you are fortified a
[36:53] man with the gospel with a word of Truth
[36:57] around your loins Glory preaching it
[37:01] says it says that's it says that's what
[37:04] it is helmet of salvation The Shield of
[37:07] Faith the sword waving in in your hand
[37:10] Satan is coming to meet you you meet him
[37:14] in the you you meet him in the name of
[37:17] in it you meet me in the name of science
[37:19] you meet me in the name of culture you
[37:22] meet me in the name of organization you
[37:24] meet me in the in in the name of this of
[37:28] that or the other but I meet you in the
[37:31] name of the Lord God of Israel I'm
[37:35] coming after you give way even death
[37:39] itself can't stand there
[37:43] we've been given a name would not be
[37:45] given to give to give in to the spirit
[37:48] of fear but we've been given a name that
[37:50] we can stand in so I I certainly say
[37:53] let's be comforted by the word of God
[37:56] and he continues only says I'm coming
[37:58] after you give way even death is
[38:00] self-concerned chop the hole right
[38:02] through it that's right he said sitting
[38:05] on me Satan's Army brings diseases God's
[38:08] Army is commissioned to cast them out
[38:12] amen there you are every time Satan
[38:15] throws any on on unto you God's Army is
[38:21] to cast him out amen cast out it says
[38:24] that's the very technique that God uses
[38:27] so if God uses it his children will use
[38:30] it he said Satan uses the army of
[38:33] Destruction the the so this this
[38:36] believes God's word and they set him up
[38:39] in the uh at the better Kingdom than
[38:42] Michael and God cast him out he says
[38:45] God's method is cast out the devil cast
[38:49] down reasoning cast down Superstition
[38:51] cast down worry cast down diseases cast
[38:55] down sin amen you are above it
[38:59] I didn't put myself above it the word
[39:01] puts me above it it says Resurrection
[39:04] resurrect resurrected in Jesus Christ
[39:07] sitting in Heavenly places everything it
[39:10] says with every devil under your foot
[39:14] that's the place for the devil all you
[39:16] got to do is remind them you are under
[39:18] my feet
[39:19] amen it says and if it starts with
[39:22] sickness
[39:23] if it starts sticking out his head in
[39:26] there and then he talks about just go
[39:28] ahead and you just go on and just
[39:30] trample on him make sure you don't give
[39:31] him a room amen you certainly enjoy the
[39:35] word this morning and and I was kind of
[39:37] conflicted because I know Ezra Matthews
[39:40] said you know this service I'll say you
[39:42] know you we got what we we needed I
[39:45] didn't want to be too long and no just
[39:46] try to be
[39:48] um I'll just start to be as concise as
[39:50] possible I'll be looking at the clock
[39:52] and now if I feel like it's time I'll
[39:54] just stop so please don't ask me to
[39:56] continue because I have enough to preach
[40:00] two three services so
[40:02] so I know the last time we preached this
[40:04] we didn't get a chance to finish uh you
[40:06] know uh I'm beginning to have a
[40:09] preacher's symptom that I just can't get
[40:11] to finish up what I'm starting so we we
[40:14] preached on the bridegroom restoring his
[40:16] own bride and as we write the scripture
[40:18] uh we write the scripture in Joel the
[40:22] scripture says that our uh Joel chapter
[40:24] 2 and verse 25 he says and I will
[40:26] restore unto you the years that the
[40:28] locusts had eaten the conquer worm and
[40:30] the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my
[40:32] great Army which I have sent unto you
[40:34] now but when I'm says in the message I
[40:37] will restore it says Thou that's the
[40:39] same insect it's the same insect just in
[40:41] different stages and then he says ye
[40:43] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[40:46] praise the name of the Lord your God and
[40:49] Eddie had dwelt wondrously with you and
[40:51] my people shall never be ashamed and
[40:54] then we also read in Psalm chapter one
[40:56] it says it says blessed is a man that
[40:59] walketh not in the counsel of the
[41:01] ungodly knows standeth in the way of
[41:04] Sinners no sitteth in the seat of of of
[41:06] the scornful but it's the light is in
[41:09] the law of the Lord and is and and in
[41:12] his law uh does he meditate day and
[41:16] night he said and he shall be like a
[41:18] tree planted by the rivers of water and
[41:21] bringeth forth its fruit in his season
[41:23] in these leaves shall not weather
[41:26] and he says whatsoever he would he doeth
[41:30] shall prosper the ungodly is not so but
[41:33] I like the shaft which the wind drivens
[41:37] away therefore the ungodly shall not
[41:40] stand in judgment nor the sinners in the
[41:42] congregation of the righteous for the
[41:45] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[41:47] but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[41:50] so as we read that I I just want to
[41:55] reiterate something so just go a little
[41:57] faster and and and remind us this I even
[42:01] enjoy just what Matthew just bringing
[42:04] that out this morning
[42:06] brother Matthew's story is the story of
[42:09] restoration
[42:10] as we see here every one of us you know
[42:14] depending on how God brought you in you
[42:17] may have not perhaps gone to the extent
[42:20] that as well brother Matthew uh said
[42:22] it's gone too and you've never been put
[42:25] in handcuffed I never been put in
[42:26] handcuffed and everything but I realized
[42:28] still that I was a sinner I needed to be
[42:31] saved I never smoked marijuana or drug
[42:34] but but I even though in that state I
[42:37] have done things that were unpleasing to
[42:39] God that I needed to be saved so every
[42:42] one of us that seats that sits here it's
[42:45] very important you realize that your
[42:46] story is a story of restoration and the
[42:49] prophet is telling us it says the the
[42:51] hit when he speaks about this
[42:53] restoration is not a partial restoration
[42:55] is the full restoration and the reason
[42:58] you say why are you saying that because
[43:00] we we don't want to come through the
[43:02] house of God and feel like what we're
[43:04] receiving there is something missing
[43:06] that oh I hear the word but yet there's
[43:09] something missing that I gotta go add so
[43:11] that it can really produce what God has
[43:13] said no this is the the full restoration
[43:16] the word that we have received in the
[43:19] end time is here to produce what God
[43:21] wants it to produce if it's by receiving
[43:24] the word of God that we receive what we
[43:26] have need of the the word of God is a
[43:30] full word and I will even go as far as
[43:32] saying for the ages as the word was
[43:34] being allocated uh whatever portion was
[43:38] given to them it was it was enough to do
[43:41] the job for that time in other words
[43:43] they couldn't come and say well oh God
[43:45] gave us just this but we need something
[43:47] else no don't ever letter because the
[43:50] moment you do that you allow the devil
[43:52] to come in and play with your mind that
[43:55] you need something more than the word
[43:57] that you need more than what God has
[43:59] provided you that you need to do
[44:01] something else and you need to to go out
[44:04] outside of the provision that is given
[44:06] for you to receive what you want to what
[44:08] you need no I'm here to say the word of
[44:11] God is giving us all that we have made
[44:13] of and it's the full restoration and the
[44:16] prophet will tell this this he says that
[44:19] the end time message
[44:21] messenger is to tie up all the loose
[44:24] hand that was left in other words he's
[44:26] doing the full job of what he was given
[44:28] to do and I will say this so without the
[44:31] messenger or the message of malachite 4
[44:33] there is no restoration
[44:36] you you couldn't there's no church under
[44:39] the Earth today that could talk about
[44:40] restoration if they didn't receive the
[44:43] message of Malachi 4 because God sent
[44:45] this word by a prophet God sends his
[44:48] word to a people and those people have
[44:50] to receive I like again I'll go back to
[44:53] what brother Mike said the work of God
[44:55] is to receive whom God has sent and when
[44:58] you've recognized whom God has sent and
[45:00] the message that they bring into you
[45:01] then you have received the plan of God
[45:05] and so as I'm saying it's a message of
[45:09] restoration to bring us back so either
[45:11] and it's the restoration to bring us
[45:13] back and it's a restoration of the word
[45:16] will bring forth the restoration of the
[45:18] faith and Faith only comes by the word
[45:21] of God and only after the word is being
[45:24] restored then faith can be restored so
[45:26] the end time restoration is to restore
[45:29] the very Harmony that existed between
[45:32] the father and the son when we can talk
[45:35] about Adam and we can talk about God how
[45:38] that says that when you sin that that
[45:41] the veil came and he says that God said
[45:43] they separated from God they lost that
[45:45] Fellowship that they had with God in the
[45:47] beginning this message is here to
[45:49] restore that Fellowship is to come back
[45:52] and take you and restore your fellowship
[45:55] with God so you can have this Oneness
[45:57] with him it didn't come so we can have
[45:59] preachers preaching to you telling you
[46:01] every day what should uh what you should
[46:03] do how you should dress and who what you
[46:06] should do and not doing everything no
[46:08] this message has come so when you hear
[46:10] it the fellowship that you as an
[46:12] individual need to have what God himself
[46:15] is restored
[46:19] and and and so that which was lost in
[46:23] the Garden of Eden God is sending it now
[46:25] in the end time to restore that in that
[46:28] perfect condition and so so I want to
[46:31] say the prophet said this is I I didn't
[46:33] capture what message it was he says
[46:36] notice it says notice it says in the
[46:39] Pentecostal age through the looters age
[46:42] through the Wesley age it's been the
[46:45] same thing through this Pentecostal age
[46:49] now he's talking he says but now notice
[46:51] but at the opening of the seals
[46:54] Revelation 10 the full word is to be
[46:58] born into manifestation again now
[47:01] there's two things I want to point out
[47:03] here he's talking about the full word
[47:04] being born into manifestation but the
[47:07] other I want to bring to our attention
[47:09] because I was just reading this and he
[47:11] just captured me it hit me like he never
[47:13] hit me before now I want you to realize
[47:15] it says but at the opening of the seal
[47:18] now there is often but one of them will
[47:20] say oh but since the seal has been
[47:22] opened by the opening of the seal then I
[47:24] begin to look this is the prophet is
[47:26] warning us to pay specific attention to
[47:29] this event what is it that it means by
[47:32] the opening of the seal in other words
[47:34] what is it that means to you as you sit
[47:36] here or he says well but since the
[47:39] opening of the sealed now what does that
[47:41] mean to you when you hear it because
[47:43] it's very important understand that the
[47:46] prophet himself will say that I have
[47:48] been sent they said as John was sent to
[47:50] prepare the first coming it says but so
[47:53] my message will prepare the second
[47:55] coming and he told me that was my job
[47:57] that was my commission that's what I was
[47:59] to do and to come in to prepare everyone
[48:02] will come and he will preach to people
[48:03] and and they will come and he was given
[48:06] this pull the first and the second for
[48:08] the attraction of the people but here he
[48:10] is now he's saying but but at the
[48:13] opening of the seals so now he's wanting
[48:15] you to pay attention that there's been
[48:17] an introduction of something else that's
[48:20] been happening it's no longer him coming
[48:22] just as preparers of the message of the
[48:25] word of God or the coming of the Lord
[48:27] but it's now letting you know that now
[48:30] something else has been happening since
[48:32] the opening of the seal now it's no
[48:34] longer me just here as the one who will
[48:37] prepare his second coming but yet now
[48:39] the word itself is here Christ is here
[48:42] he's trying to make himself known unto
[48:45] you it's no longer me speaking to you
[48:47] but it's the word Christ himself
[48:49] speaking to you
[48:51] because if we don't catch that
[48:53] transition we'll miss what the message
[48:55] is all about that's why you'll come and
[48:57] say who's this Melchizedek he says
[48:59] there's a man here who can turn on the
[49:01] light why could he say that because the
[49:03] seals have been hoping why because the
[49:06] one who could turn on the light was
[49:08] there to turn on the light it's no
[49:10] longer just an introduction from the
[49:13] messenger introducing the message saying
[49:15] oh I'm here to send to prepare the
[49:17] hearts and to do all those things but
[49:19] now he's bringing you to the attention
[49:20] there is actually somebody here who can
[49:24] turn on the light and don't miss that
[49:26] transition because if you miss it you'll
[49:28] be looking at the prophet all the time
[49:30] but if you catch the transition you'll
[49:33] be able to look at the word and say the
[49:35] word is here Christ is here himself and
[49:38] it's a word revealing himself to his
[49:40] bride so he can turkey up from this
[49:43] planet
[49:45] and that's very important because this
[49:48] word has taken a turn to something that
[49:51] people didn't even expect so he says
[49:53] that the full word is to be born into
[49:56] manifestation and the vanity and
[49:59] Vindicated by the spirit of God in full
[50:01] strength as it was when he was here on
[50:04] Earth so he's saying the Vindication of
[50:08] his presence in the end time is to be
[50:11] exactly the same as when he was here on
[50:13] Earth by himself so his presence is
[50:16] always known why because he does the
[50:19] same thing every time
[50:21] manifested in the same way doing the
[50:24] same thing that he did when he was here
[50:25] on Earth amen Hebrews 39 says Jesus
[50:29] Christ Jesus Christ the same the the
[50:32] same yesterday today and forever he says
[50:35] in sin sent Luke 17 and 30 he says he
[50:38] says in the last day as it was in the
[50:42] days of Sodom when the son of man when
[50:45] this uh when the son of man will be
[50:47] revealed himself again it says it will
[50:50] do the same thing the world has gone in
[50:54] the Sodom condition and the church has
[50:57] went in in Sodom with it it says like
[51:00] Lord and his wife and I say that there
[51:03] is an elect church somewhere in this
[51:06] world that that will that that's pulled
[51:09] out and set aside from those things and
[51:13] the manifestation of God has attracted
[51:15] its intention we are in the last day
[51:18] what is attracted that attention and and
[51:21] I'll say this the those that were
[51:23] attracted in the First full they just
[51:25] came for the for for the healing those
[51:27] who are attracted in the second pool
[51:29] they were only attracted because he
[51:32] could tell them what they were thinking
[51:33] and they would saw all those things and
[51:35] everything but the attraction of the
[51:37] third pool it's not just the sign and
[51:39] wonders it's not just the the calling
[51:42] forth of what you're thinking but it's
[51:44] the revealing of the word that's
[51:46] tracking that attracted your attention
[51:48] it's God himself making himself known in
[51:50] his word that's what has attracted your
[51:53] attention in this end time
[51:55] so therefore even as we said
[51:59] where he said we said so the end time
[52:02] manifestation is only here to attract a
[52:05] specific group of people
[52:07] it's not for everybody
[52:09] there were those that were attracted in
[52:11] the first bowl that was many in the
[52:14] second poll there was a lot but in the
[52:16] third poll it was only a few bits that
[52:19] were attracted even as the prophet will
[52:22] talk about how that he said we have to
[52:24] say things in the way to drive others to
[52:26] go why because they came for those that
[52:29] came for the love and fish that received
[52:31] what they wanted and they went away you
[52:34] know God is not someone that we just go
[52:36] when we are sick I said oh God then I
[52:38] need you and you need something other
[52:40] than a God then I need you and you every
[52:43] time you ever need no God wants us to
[52:46] give ourselves to him
[52:48] whether sick or not and and whether we
[52:51] are well or not regardless of what
[52:53] condition we are in in fact I'm also as
[52:57] we have health in our being as we have a
[52:59] voice to say this being was created to
[53:02] be the manifestation of God it was not
[53:05] created for that Jesus go use your body
[53:07] for a job and get let's pay and and
[53:10] rejoice over that and continue to do
[53:12] that no God give you this being so you
[53:15] can use it for his kingdom he gave it to
[53:18] you so you can use your mouth to speak
[53:20] his word he your hands so you can touch
[53:22] people and make them wild to his hands
[53:25] so you can do the works that he wants
[53:27] you to do
[53:28] if we can only understand that and catch
[53:31] that Revelation it's him manifesting
[53:34] himself in his people
[53:36] now we just read the scripture as we
[53:39] read in Psalm 1 and I just want to read
[53:41] it from the amplify and I thought it was
[53:45] it's just been such a blessing I've read
[53:47] it just uh so many days and have just
[53:50] been meditating on it and I feel like I
[53:53] just haven't really comprehend the whole
[53:55] of what he talks what he's talking about
[53:57] here and I want to say that it says I
[53:59] think I said it last time the the when
[54:02] you read this I want you to realize this
[54:05] is God's desire for you to be this is
[54:09] God that when he created you to be here
[54:12] on Earth this is the job that he created
[54:14] you to do he wanted you to be like this
[54:17] tree he wanted you to be settled to be
[54:20] like to have the qualification or or the
[54:23] attribute that you this tree has from
[54:26] the amplifier it will go like this he
[54:28] said blessed all happy and fortunate and
[54:32] prosperous and enviable
[54:34] I thought that was just enviable a
[54:37] Christian has to meet someone that's
[54:39] enviable not you envying the world but
[54:42] the world looks in at you and envying
[54:44] you for what you are the peace that you
[54:47] have the calmness that you have the way
[54:50] about uh to doing things that you have
[54:52] not one that will blow his casket and
[54:55] get mad and throw everything out no but
[54:57] one that just has a nature that's
[54:59] attractive it says enviable is a man who
[55:03] walketh not who who walketh and liveth
[55:06] not in the Council of on the ungodly in
[55:09] other words who follows their advice
[55:11] their plans and the then the and the
[55:14] purposes it says nor uh submit
[55:18] submissive and uh inactive in the part
[55:21] where Sinners walk walk nor sittle down
[55:25] or to relax or to rest now I want you to
[55:28] see this qualification that this
[55:31] scripture is giving so you don't want to
[55:33] be submersible inactive in standing in
[55:37] the things of the world you don't want
[55:39] to be one that relaxes or rest uh sits
[55:44] down where the scornful said or you want
[55:46] to you don't want to be gathered with
[55:48] the markers that will sit down and and
[55:50] talk and Mark and and wonder oh God made
[55:54] a promise but I don't see it come to
[55:55] pass what is it of it and all those
[55:57] things but he said but he shall be like
[56:01] a tree that's firmly planted
[56:05] and tendered by the stream of waters it
[56:09] says ready to bring forth its fruits in
[56:12] a season its leaves shall not fade or
[56:15] wither and everything that it do it does
[56:19] shall prosper Us in other words and come
[56:22] to maturity
[56:25] and come to maturity now it says uh not
[56:31] not so with the wicked those disobedient
[56:34] and living without God uh are not so but
[56:39] they are like the shaft it says
[56:41] worthless dead without substance which
[56:45] the wind that drive us away I I I got
[56:48] it's important you realize that there's
[56:50] many people here on Earth that are like
[56:53] wind
[56:54] they are dead they just yes they are on
[56:58] the face of the Earth and you come
[57:00] across them every day and and you wrap
[57:02] shoulders with them but yet they are
[57:04] lack of wind they have no there's no
[57:07] purpose about what they do they they are
[57:09] dead they are separated from God and you
[57:12] don't want to follow after that example
[57:15] it says it says it says therefore the
[57:18] wicked those disobedient living without
[57:20] God shall not stand justified in
[57:23] judgment no seated in the uh in the
[57:26] congregation of the righteous those who
[57:28] are upright and in and and and in right
[57:32] standing with God
[57:34] for the Lord and is fully acquainted for
[57:38] the Lord knows and be fully acquainted
[57:40] with the way of the righteous but the
[57:42] way of the ungodly those living outside
[57:45] of of God's will Shall Perish
[57:49] you know
[57:50] it's important to realize it all you
[57:54] have to do is bring a sinner in the
[57:56] congregation of the Saints
[57:58] there would either be converted or
[58:00] changed or they will run out they won't
[58:03] be able to stand it why because the
[58:04] presence of God will come and it will
[58:07] cause about that decision to be made it
[58:10] will cause a change to be made it's
[58:12] either you come in or you go out but one
[58:14] will not be able to stand so therefore
[58:17] as we look at the characteristics of
[58:18] this tree that's what Ram will say it's
[58:21] a tree that's planted by the water and
[58:24] it's got its all nine gifts of spirits
[58:26] and and nine gifts of one Spirit hanging
[58:30] all over it and it's there and it says
[58:33] it's leaves it's there for the to create
[58:35] a shadow on the people under which
[58:37] people can come and and extends their
[58:40] its fruit is for the people to enjoy it
[58:43] and all those things and I'm not saying
[58:45] this it's you that I'm talking about
[58:47] it's you you you have to find yourself
[58:50] and say tonight that if God made me to
[58:54] be like that tree
[58:56] because I believe sometimes the mistake
[58:58] we made is when we read something like
[59:00] this we say oh god
[59:02] um I I am what I am but I want you to
[59:05] make me this I I want if you can tonight
[59:08] at least try to change your language in
[59:11] saying that in in other uh uh instead of
[59:15] saying God this is what I want to be but
[59:18] you say that God this is what you made
[59:20] me to be
[59:22] because because we cannot be something
[59:25] that we are not
[59:26] if you recognize this as what you are
[59:29] this is what you will stay in but if you
[59:32] recognize the word as what you are this
[59:34] is what you walk in so when we look at
[59:37] the promises and the word of God there
[59:39] has to be something within us say that
[59:41] this is what I'm meant to be this is
[59:44] what I was created to be and walk in it
[59:50] I was looking
[59:52] and I came across this and I I hope it
[59:55] will be a blessing for you
[59:57] and I just asked myself even in the
[1:00:00] natural
[1:00:02] what what is just what is the purpose of
[1:00:04] a tree
[1:00:07] just look around and you see them
[1:00:10] everywhere just what what what benefit
[1:00:12] do they serve are they just blending
[1:00:14] like flowers so they can look good and
[1:00:16] and you know and just stand around and
[1:00:18] and lose those two do those things
[1:00:22] and and I came across this and I thought
[1:00:24] it was so beautiful it's just a few
[1:00:26] things that I could just Court out
[1:00:27] quickly so we can move on
[1:00:29] it says the tree combats greenhouse
[1:00:32] effect
[1:00:35] a tree cleans the air
[1:00:38] a tree provide oxygen
[1:00:41] so you can think about when they talk
[1:00:44] about greenhouses
[1:00:46] I believe it's said to be an effect
[1:00:48] where the Sun or the heat get uh uh
[1:00:52] trapped close to the earth and the tree
[1:00:55] has the ability to absorb those things
[1:00:59] it clears the air and it provides oxygen
[1:01:03] you can think about all of the emissions
[1:01:05] and everything all the cars everything
[1:01:07] that we're generating you realize that
[1:01:09] it's toxic so the tree will absorb all
[1:01:13] of that and produce oxygen so you can
[1:01:15] breathe
[1:01:17] now I'm talking about a believer I'm not
[1:01:19] talking about a tree
[1:01:21] a tree cools the streets down and the
[1:01:25] cities
[1:01:26] and I thought that's why we have so much
[1:01:29] hit in Texas is because we don't have a
[1:01:30] lot of trees but you go to a places like
[1:01:33] Carolinas and the others there's just
[1:01:36] the the size of the trees and you know
[1:01:39] you you go back in Africa there's trees
[1:01:41] that are over a thousand years old that
[1:01:44] will stand there you're like nobody
[1:01:46] Waters this street how come it's leaving
[1:01:47] why because it's planted
[1:01:50] it has water underneath that it could
[1:01:53] breathe that it could take it that tree
[1:01:55] is there for the survival of the
[1:01:57] civilization that tree is there to
[1:02:00] provide life to a people so he would say
[1:02:03] the tree it the tree conserves energy
[1:02:08] a tree saves water
[1:02:11] a tree helps prevent water pollution
[1:02:15] a tree it helps Prevail uh prevent the
[1:02:19] soil erosion so if you have trees and
[1:02:23] it's on the ground that ground is
[1:02:25] protected because there's a tree I
[1:02:27] thought isn't that what the prophet told
[1:02:29] us he said the only reason God has not
[1:02:32] destroyed this Earth is because you are
[1:02:34] here
[1:02:35] the only reason why this world has not
[1:02:37] gone into a complete chaos and the fire
[1:02:40] burned by fire is because the bride is
[1:02:42] still here so it's important you realize
[1:02:45] that I'm here for more than just my job
[1:02:47] I'm here for more than just feeding my
[1:02:50] family I'm here as God's ecosystem
[1:02:53] keeping the things that around me alive
[1:02:57] because if we fail to see that we just
[1:03:00] we look at our lives so many times as
[1:03:03] just a worthless thing so I gotta get to
[1:03:05] you know I got to go to work and I got
[1:03:07] to do this if you look at it just on the
[1:03:09] surface like that you don't see any
[1:03:11] meaning you don't see any production but
[1:03:14] if you can understand what you are
[1:03:16] placed here on Earth Therefore your job
[1:03:18] has more meaning the people that you
[1:03:20] know it means more because you know
[1:03:23] you've been placed there to just give
[1:03:24] them the right words and the right time
[1:03:28] the scripture says in Galatians 5 and 22
[1:03:31] it says but the fruits of the spirit is
[1:03:34] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:03:38] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:03:41] against such there is no law
[1:03:43] it says and they
[1:03:47] they that are in they that are Christ
[1:03:51] they that are Christ have crucified the
[1:03:54] flesh with the with the F with the
[1:03:57] affections and the lust it says and if
[1:04:01] we live in the spirit let us walk in the
[1:04:05] spirit
[1:04:06] it says let us not be desirious of vain
[1:04:10] Glory provoking one another envy and
[1:04:14] other and and and envying one another so
[1:04:18] now and I can say this if there's one
[1:04:21] thing we need to provoke one another to
[1:04:23] is to provoke one another to the word
[1:04:26] to the achievement of God to the things
[1:04:28] that God has promised to do in this
[1:04:30] generation to bring us into the fold in
[1:04:33] the realization of what God is doing to
[1:04:36] bring us to a place where we can realize
[1:04:37] I have been blessed here in order to
[1:04:40] play God's purpose in fact you are part
[1:04:43] of the restoration of God
[1:04:46] we but right as you mentioned this this
[1:04:49] morning restoration is to bring back to
[1:04:51] its owner restoration foreign
[1:04:57] to restore and claim can be acclaimed
[1:05:02] can be made to enforce now let's bring
[1:05:05] it it says now to bring it anything back
[1:05:09] to its rightful owner it says where they
[1:05:12] had the where it belonged to they
[1:05:13] therefore some way it went away from its
[1:05:17] rightful owner and and can wander around
[1:05:20] anywhere but to restore is to bring it
[1:05:24] back
[1:05:25] to who really owned it or to bring it
[1:05:28] back to it naturally state where it was
[1:05:32] in the first place to bring it back
[1:05:35] uh into the natural condition in order
[1:05:38] to do that we have to have the right to
[1:05:40] enforcement
[1:05:42] we have to have the right enforcement
[1:05:44] and what does that tell you you know
[1:05:47] this ride is not just some girls that's
[1:05:50] been gotten somewhere in some streets
[1:05:52] everywhere she was in the mind of God in
[1:05:55] the beginning that's why she could be
[1:05:56] restored she was too she she had to be
[1:06:00] with God in the beginning in order to be
[1:06:02] restored so when we talk about this
[1:06:04] restoration it's not just something
[1:06:06] happening where we were born in Saint
[1:06:09] Shepherd iniquity but yet we are making
[1:06:11] a claim to something that doesn't belong
[1:06:13] to us but yet the prophet is saying that
[1:06:15] he's bringing you right back because the
[1:06:17] way you came You Came the way of sin but
[1:06:20] God's intention is to bring you the
[1:06:22] right way is to bring you in the right
[1:06:25] way for you to manifest the things that
[1:06:27] he promised or that he wanted you to
[1:06:29] manifest
[1:06:31] but what I'm going to say this in Christ
[1:06:33] The Mystery of God revealed it says
[1:06:35] and then the word moves on down into the
[1:06:41] body
[1:06:42] now
[1:06:44] but as a to preface this or before I say
[1:06:48] this I read it again you can put it up
[1:06:50] there it's paragraph Christ the ministry
[1:06:52] of God revealed paragraph 595.
[1:06:56] we know the prophet has told us
[1:06:59] that we've come from the bosom of God
[1:07:03] we we in fact it says as he was so are
[1:07:07] we
[1:07:08] we are born of his born flesh of his
[1:07:11] flesh attribute of his attribute all of
[1:07:13] those things so I want you to remember
[1:07:15] that and and now hear what he's saying
[1:07:17] here and the word moves on down into the
[1:07:23] body
[1:07:24] from the head
[1:07:27] what is it the same word nothing can be
[1:07:31] added or taken from it now
[1:07:35] we say that a lot but let me if I if you
[1:07:39] allow me just this nothing can be added
[1:07:42] or taken in other words the same power
[1:07:45] that he had when he was in the head the
[1:07:47] same things that he could do when he was
[1:07:49] in the head the same attribute the same
[1:07:52] when it was in Jesus which is the head
[1:07:54] the same word that was in Christ the
[1:07:57] same word that that spoke and raised the
[1:08:00] dead and the same word that came and
[1:08:02] made creation it says that same word is
[1:08:06] moving into the body and he says now
[1:08:09] he's saying that you can't take anything
[1:08:11] away from it you can't add to it so
[1:08:14] because oftentimes when we say that we
[1:08:16] mean explanation but no I'm talking
[1:08:18] about the power of it the attribute of
[1:08:21] it the effects of it its ability to
[1:08:24] change its ability to transform don't
[1:08:27] take it away don't add anything to it it
[1:08:30] says it comes down it says nothing can
[1:08:33] be had or taken away from it so that
[1:08:35] same word moves from the head which
[1:08:39] Christ it says as the day came Come
[1:08:43] Close comes close down into the body
[1:08:46] it says down into the body vindicating
[1:08:50] that they are one
[1:08:52] what is that invisible Union the word
[1:08:56] itself like I said at the opening of the
[1:08:59] seal something happened but that word is
[1:09:03] now coming it's not just oh I saw that
[1:09:06] was the picture of of of Christ being
[1:09:08] taken up there now we're saying no the
[1:09:11] word the full word that was revealed
[1:09:13] that word that was Christ is now moving
[1:09:17] into the body to unite it says they are
[1:09:20] one vindicating that they are one it
[1:09:24] says they are husband and wife
[1:09:27] they are flesh of his flesh word of his
[1:09:29] word life of his life Spirit of his
[1:09:32] spirit amen he says how do you know it
[1:09:35] he Bears it says Bears the same record
[1:09:38] same fruit same word you see manifests
[1:09:43] manifests Christ's same life it says
[1:09:46] same God Same Spirit same word same book
[1:09:50] amen same sign things that I do ye shall
[1:09:54] do also so let me say this we we cannot
[1:09:58] do the works of Christ by ourselves
[1:10:05] and and no one can manifest the nature
[1:10:09] of Christ unless Christ himself is in
[1:10:12] him
[1:10:13] no one can do the works of Christ unless
[1:10:16] Christ is in him so it so when we say
[1:10:20] it's the word I want us to understand
[1:10:22] that it does the same exact thing that
[1:10:25] he did when he was required it's God
[1:10:27] he's now taking as a promise The God Who
[1:10:30] was above us the God who was with us
[1:10:33] that same God will be in us so now the
[1:10:36] prophet is saying in Christ The Mystery
[1:10:37] of God revealed that word is as we speak
[1:10:40] right now moving into the body
[1:10:44] oh I say word of God move on me word of
[1:10:48] God come change my life word of God come
[1:10:51] take this to fall a man who who makes
[1:10:54] mistakes who fails and who does things
[1:10:56] he doesn't want to do come move in me
[1:10:59] come causing me about the change so I
[1:11:02] can produce what you want me to do so I
[1:11:04] can produce what you expect for me to
[1:11:06] produce why because it's the same life
[1:11:08] that's moving
[1:11:10] that's what we want we don't want some
[1:11:12] explanation of understanding but we want
[1:11:15] to understand when the when he says at
[1:11:18] the opening of the seals we want to
[1:11:20] understand now the word is moving into
[1:11:23] the body it's no longer some men
[1:11:25] speaking to you but it's the bride
[1:11:27] himself
[1:11:28] the bridegroom himself speaking to his
[1:11:31] bride but when I'm says Whispering
[1:11:33] sacred in your ears
[1:11:35] what is he telling you it's time to go
[1:11:38] it's going home time let's all stand I
[1:11:41] don't want to go too long I want to make
[1:11:43] sure we can have our communion
[1:11:46] amen amen I believe that's what we can
[1:11:49] have communion with
[1:11:50] we have in communion with him because he
[1:11:54] has come down is reveal his word to us
[1:11:57] so we can come and have communion with
[1:12:00] him amen amen
[1:12:03] if the brothers could go and get a
[1:12:07] communion we'll just open our Bible in
[1:12:10] First Corinthians chapter 11. amen
[1:12:47] foreign
[1:13:17] man I saw from the 23rd
[1:13:23] it says for I have received
[1:13:25] of the Lord that which I also have
[1:13:27] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:13:29] the same night
[1:13:31] in in which he was betrayed took bread
[1:13:33] and when he had given thanks he breaked
[1:13:37] it he break it and said take eat this is
[1:13:40] my body
[1:13:41] which is broken for you
[1:13:43] this do it in remembrance of me
[1:13:46] and after the same manner also he took
[1:13:49] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:13:52] cup is the New Testament in my blood do
[1:13:56] this ye
[1:13:58] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:14:00] of me
[1:14:02] for as often as ye eat and eat this
[1:14:05] bread and drink this cup you do show the
[1:14:09] Lord's death till it comes
[1:14:12] it says whatsoever wherefore whatsoever
[1:14:15] shall eat and shall eat this bread and
[1:14:18] drink this cup of the Lord unworldly
[1:14:20] shall be guilty of the blood the body
[1:14:23] and the blood of the Lord but let every
[1:14:25] man examine himself so let him eat
[1:14:28] of the bread of that bread and drink of
[1:14:31] that cup
[1:14:32] for ye thy eateth and drinketh unworldly
[1:14:35] eat it and drink a damnation to himself
[1:14:37] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:14:40] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:14:43] among you and many sleep
[1:14:45] for if we judge ourselves we should not
[1:14:49] be judged but when we are judged we are
[1:14:52] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[1:14:54] condemn that we should not be condemned
[1:14:57] with the world wherefore my bread and
[1:14:59] when we come when he come together to
[1:15:01] eat Terry one for another
[1:15:04] it says
[1:15:06] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:15:08] home
[1:15:10] that ye come not together unto
[1:15:13] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:15:15] order when I come
[1:15:18] let's just pray over the bread and all
[1:15:20] the wine
[1:15:27] our gracious father we
[1:15:29] so thankful father that you've given us
[1:15:32] the revelation of what we're about to do

[1:15:40] body father your the bread of life the
[1:15:43] bread that come down from heaven
[1:15:46] you said on that day you said I am the
[1:15:49] bread that have come down from heaven

[1:15:54] me they shall live
[1:15:56] father God we need that life that comes
[1:15:59] from you oh God
[1:16:00] and we eat this bride in representation
[1:16:03] of your body
[1:16:05] father that you may just let it come and
[1:16:07] your Prophet will tell us that there's
[1:16:09] healing in communion

[1:16:13] Deliverance in communion Lord we don't
[1:16:16] come to be condemned we don't come to
[1:16:19] be chastened but we come further that we
[1:16:21] may be edified that we may receive the
[1:16:24] benefit of this oh God and I pray that
[1:16:27] if it be anything Lord that you may
[1:16:29] forgive us
[1:16:31] we confess our wrong to you
[1:16:33] and father before we can take it so that
[1:16:35] you can come and cleanse us you said
[1:16:38] that if we confess our wrong to you that
[1:16:40] you are just and faithful to forgive us
[1:16:42] we pray that you may just bless this
[1:16:45] bread as we take it that it may just
[1:16:47] come and father fill us with yourself
[1:16:50] bless the swine o God and
[1:16:53] Lord they even the scripture will say
[1:16:56] there's a stimulation of Revelation it
[1:16:58] says touch not the oil and the wine
[1:17:00] father this is what we need in order for
[1:17:03] the Life to Come O God and to come and
[1:17:06] take that which we have eaten and make
[1:17:08] it life oh God we pray father that even
[1:17:11] as we take it Lord the purpose for which

[1:31:07] it says now before the Feast of the
[1:31:09] Passover
[1:31:11] Jesus
[1:31:12] Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:31:15] that he should depart out of this world
[1:31:18] unto the father having loved his own
[1:31:20] which were in the world he loved them
[1:31:24] unto the end
[1:31:26] and supper being ended and the devil
[1:31:28] having put in the heart of
[1:31:30] Judas Iscariot Simon sent to betray him
[1:31:33] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:31:36] him and given all things into his hand
[1:31:38] and that it was come from God and went
[1:31:42] to God
[1:31:43] he raised it from the supper and laid
[1:31:46] aside His Garment and took a towel and
[1:31:48] girded himself and after he poured water
[1:31:51] into a basin and began to wash the
[1:31:55] disciples feet and wipe them with with a
[1:31:59] towel which he was which he was scared
[1:32:02] then coming to Simon Peter Simon Simon
[1:32:06] Peter and Simon to Simon Peter and and
[1:32:10] Peter said unto him
[1:32:12] Lord
[1:32:13] thou wash my fate
[1:32:16] Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:32:19] what I do without know it not now but
[1:32:22] Thou shalt no way Hereafter and Peter
[1:32:24] said unto him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:32:27] feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:32:30] not thou has no part with me
[1:32:33] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not only
[1:32:36] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:32:40] head Jesus said unto him
[1:32:42] he that was he that he that is washed
[1:32:45] needeth not safe to wash
[1:32:48] his feet but he's cleaned every weight
[1:32:50] for ye are clean but not all
[1:32:53] for he knew who should betray him
[1:32:56] therefore he said you are not all clean
[1:32:59] so after he had washed
[1:33:01] their feet and had taken the Garment and
[1:33:04] was set down again and said unto them ye
[1:33:10] know ye what I have done to you you call
[1:33:13] me master and Lord and ye say well for
[1:33:15] so I am and if I then your Lord and
[1:33:18] Master
[1:33:20] have washed your feet
[1:33:22] you also ought to wash one another's
[1:33:24] feet for I have given you an example
[1:33:27] that you should follow
[1:33:29] you should do as I have done unto you
[1:33:33] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:33:35] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:33:39] that is sent greater than him thus send
[1:33:41] him
[1:33:42] if you know these things happy I.E when
[1:33:45] you do them amen the sisters can go to
[1:33:48] the place and the brothers will meet
