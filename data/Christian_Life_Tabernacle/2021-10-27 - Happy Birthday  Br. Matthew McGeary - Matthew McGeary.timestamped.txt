[32:17] to be able to speak to you it's
[32:20] my dad's birthday
[32:22] 72 years and it is also my son's
[32:25] birthday he's two years old so i told my
[32:28] dad
[32:29] on
[32:30] when my son was born i said i couldn't
[32:31] think of anything better to get you than
[32:33] a grandson
[32:36] so
[32:37] so now he has to share his special day
[32:40] with my son
[32:41] every time so but
[32:43] but we're thankful we have this
[32:44] opportunity we do want to bring you
[32:46] uh greetings from the saints there in
[32:48] galena missouri from brother brown's
[32:50] church
[32:51] they send their love and greetings so
[32:53] just continue to pray for them
[32:55] as they're continuing to press the
[32:56] battle you know uh brother brown was the
[32:59] pastor there for
[33:00] us
[33:01] i don't know if it's 40 or 50 maybe
[33:03] almost 50 years
[33:04] and so they're
[33:05] looking to the new chapter for that
[33:08] pastor that god would bring along so
[33:09] just let's just bind together with them
[33:11] in prayer and we know that god has the
[33:14] right man for the job amen praise the
[33:16] lord let's just read out of daniel
[33:18] chapter 11 verse
[33:22] 32. and it reads and such as do wickedly
[33:25] against the covenant shall he corrupt by
[33:27] flatteries but the but the people that
[33:30] do know their god shall be strong
[33:33] and do exploits
[33:34] and also first john 1 7
[33:43] first john
[33:45] chapter 1 verse 7 but if we walk in the
[33:47] light as he is in the light
[33:50] we have fellowship one with another and
[33:52] the blood of jesus christ
[33:54] his son cleanseth us from all sin
[33:58] if you just turn now to chapter 5
[34:01] and verse 4
[34:04] it says for whatsoever is born of god
[34:07] overcometh the world
[34:10] and this is the victory that overcometh
[34:12] the world even our
[34:14] faith amen we just ask the lord to add a
[34:17] blessing upon the reading of the word
[34:19] you may be seated
[34:21] and just in
[34:23] reading that last scripture for
[34:24] whatsoever is born of god
[34:28] overcometh the world
[34:30] i mean how many have been born of god
[34:33] well i want to say to you tonight happy
[34:35] birthday
[34:38] happy birthday
[34:40] maybe that's what we'll speak on a
[34:41] little tonight is happy birthday
[34:44] i think that would be all right
[34:46] you look into the message and brother
[34:48] branham would even say those words you
[34:50] know about his birthday he says i'm not
[34:52] counting i'm not counting the natural
[34:54] years
[34:55] but i'm counting the natural and i read
[34:57] one quote he said it's been 24 years
[34:58] since i was born again
[35:01] and i tell you what if you've ever been
[35:03] born again you just read this scripture
[35:05] right here it says for whosoever is born
[35:07] of god
[35:08] overcometh the world
[35:10] well i might that might sound simple but
[35:12] you can just start you could just start
[35:14] rejoicing right there if you have been
[35:15] born of god if you have been born again
[35:18] that means you overcome the world i tell
[35:21] you what you get to looking around at
[35:22] the world nowadays and to think that god
[35:24] has done something for you that when you
[35:27] have been born again when you have been
[35:29] born of god you overcometh the world and
[35:32] he said this is the victory that
[35:35] overcometh the world even our faith
[35:38] which is a gift of god look uh when god
[35:40] birthed you into his mind and into his
[35:43] thinking and when he brought you forth
[35:44] in this day and age he provided you
[35:46] everything that you ever had in need of
[35:48] amen so we can be a happy people
[35:51] we should be rejoicing
[35:53] we should be able to say happy birthday
[35:56] amen because we we have been born into
[35:59] the family of god there's a joy
[36:01] i tell you there's a joy in serving god
[36:03] we're a part of something special we're
[36:05] a part of the family of god and and as
[36:07] we just move here a little bit we've
[36:09] been uh uh just some of our inspiration
[36:12] coming out of there's a man that can
[36:13] turn on the light he says this in
[36:15] paragraph 269 he says there is a man
[36:17] here that can turn on the lights all
[36:19] right
[36:20] what does he do
[36:22] by vindicating his word for this day
[36:26] now that that's really important right
[36:27] there by vindicating the word for this
[36:30] day
[36:31] earlier on in this message he would say
[36:33] that's the problem is everybody wants to
[36:35] put on their ecclesial ecclesiastical
[36:37] glasses and they want to look at god
[36:39] through their ecclesiastical ways of
[36:41] thinking and and something that's been
[36:43] on my heart as we read this word uh
[36:46] as we continue on the prophet is going
[36:48] to say that by vindicating his word for
[36:50] this day jesus the son of god who
[36:53] promised the word for this day is right
[36:55] here with us
[36:56] don't get scared
[36:58] don't pay any attention to what they're
[37:00] doing
[37:02] you you you'll walk in darkness
[37:05] be wise they that do wise daniel said
[37:08] and these last days will do exploits for
[37:10] their god see they'll walk in the light
[37:13] as he is in the light and i want you to
[37:16] just focus here how the prophet is
[37:18] taking now daniel 11 32 that they will
[37:21] know their god they will be strong into
[37:23] exploits and he's tying that together to
[37:26] first john and and so many times when we
[37:29] think of exploits we start to think that
[37:31] well well oh we start to think of signs
[37:33] and wonders and we start to think
[37:34] thinking
[37:35] of these big evangelistical moves and
[37:37] these meetings and we got to be running
[37:39] around and doing all these things but
[37:41] notice the prophet now he's entering
[37:43] into the third pool the final stage of
[37:45] his ministry and he's tying daniel 11 32
[37:49] to 1st john and he's saying that those
[37:51] that know their god
[37:53] they will be strong and they will no
[37:55] exploits if you walk in the light as he
[37:58] is in the light we have fellowship one
[38:00] with another so what we want to do is we
[38:02] want to manifest the word for our hour
[38:05] for our day we we want the word to be
[38:07] vindicated and made flesh to us the
[38:09] individual not looking at a day gone by
[38:12] not looking at it today gone past and
[38:13] trying to resurrect something in the
[38:15] past that was manifested in another age
[38:18] but god has exploits for the bride he
[38:20] has a work for the bride that's
[38:22] something that she is doing under this
[38:24] revelation under that that third pull
[38:26] revealing that has been given to you and
[38:28] many times what we do is we put on our
[38:30] ecclesiastical glasses oh we're going to
[38:32] know our god we're going to be strong
[38:34] we're going to do exploit and we start
[38:36] to filter through our mind and filter
[38:39] through our ideas of what we think the
[38:42] exploits and the works of god are and
[38:44] that we really if we're not careful we
[38:47] start to try to manufacture something
[38:49] and impersonate a move of god that's
[38:51] going on somewhere else look we're all
[38:53] guilty of it we look at something we see
[38:55] the move of god going out there's
[38:57] something we appreciate those things
[38:59] we're thankful for the move of god but
[39:01] we want the move of god in our life we
[39:03] want the move of god in our church we
[39:05] want to move god in our family in our
[39:07] house when i wake up in the morning i
[39:09] want the move of god in my life i'm not
[39:10] looking for something afar off and
[39:12] trying to look at something that way out
[39:14] there and trying to bring it into
[39:16] manufacturing but if you're walking with
[39:18] him if you're walking in the light as he
[39:20] is in the light and you have been born
[39:22] again and there's a faith that has made
[39:24] you an overcomer and you're walking with
[39:25] jehovah jireh he's the one that's
[39:27] providing for you he's the one that's
[39:29] leading you he's the one that's guiding
[39:31] you he's the one leading you at all
[39:33] truth and righteousness and if you're
[39:35] walking with him why then you've
[39:36] surrendered to the word and it's no
[39:38] longer you that liveth but it's christ
[39:40] that liveth in you and now that you've
[39:42] surrendered yourself to him he can pick
[39:44] up your body he can speak through your
[39:46] mouth he can walk into the restaurant he
[39:48] could he could walk into the church
[39:50] house he could walk over to the
[39:51] neighbors and now what is it it's god
[39:54] becoming tangible god living in a party
[39:57] god living him a bride doing exploits in
[39:59] the last days
[40:01] what did he say he said the third pool
[40:02] wasn't a public show we want some public
[40:05] show with what we want
[40:07] we want some big big mighty big
[40:09] fantastic to get everybody's attention
[40:11] and what does it do it vindicates you is
[40:13] all it does
[40:14] it causes a lot of problem because you
[40:17] get the glory you get the vindication
[40:19] look what we did look at the mighty move
[40:21] and what we're doing
[40:23] but god isn't interested in those things
[40:25] he's injured to a pride that's dead to
[40:27] the things of the world dead to
[40:29] denominational unbelief in his word
[40:31] trying to trying to manufacture
[40:33] something trying to he praise on herself
[40:35] and look what we did look how many
[40:36] people we fed look at how many homeless
[40:38] shelters we've built
[40:40] and all they're doing is heaping praise
[40:42] upon themselves
[40:44] but god wants a love relationship with a
[40:47] bride in the end time that's a sudden
[40:49] secret going away
[40:51] a union between the earthly bride and
[40:53] the heavenly bridegroom
[40:55] and it's a secret
[40:58] it's a secret catching away
[41:03] oh he says by vindicating the word for
[41:05] this day
[41:09] there is a man who can turn on the light
[41:12] and he's tying now daniel 11 32 with
[41:14] first john
[41:16] and he says they'll walk in the light as
[41:18] he is in the light don't worry it may be
[41:20] dark
[41:21] looks like they're going to force us
[41:23] everyone
[41:25] all these you see their proclamations
[41:27] going out and all these little churches
[41:29] and things
[41:30] are got to come in now you've got to
[41:32] come in or they're going to close you up
[41:35] they're going to make it now we want to
[41:37] hit that real hard tonight when i when i
[41:40] get to this time now
[41:41] that work they're saying we're going to
[41:43] close you up you have to be one of
[41:46] them or not you're either into that or
[41:49] you or you can't do nothing you can't
[41:51] even buy or sell
[41:53] that's it you dares not pray for the
[41:56] sick if you are caught ministering to
[41:58] the sick or any other person with any
[42:00] spiritual thing in there you're subject
[42:01] to federal law to be executed that's
[42:04] exactly right see you know that that's
[42:06] right it's in their papers yes sir so
[42:09] you cannot do it you have to belong to
[42:12] the cult brother let me tell you
[42:14] something you better get christ sure in
[42:16] your heart right now
[42:18] because there's coming a time uh where
[42:21] you're really going to need it
[42:23] well i say you must be born again
[42:26] i say there's no time like the present
[42:28] if you need to be born again if you need
[42:30] to be filled with the holy ghost i tell
[42:32] you we can have a birthday here tonight
[42:34] we could be saying happy birthday
[42:36] there's water come ye who are all who
[42:38] are heavy laden and i will give you a
[42:40] rest look there's no time like the
[42:41] present so many times we want to look
[42:44] and try to figure everything out he says
[42:45] when the squeeze comes you know how
[42:48] things are going to start tightening up
[42:49] watch the third pull then
[42:51] and everybody is looking for what the
[42:53] third pull is going to be
[42:55] well my the third pool is the spoken
[42:58] word and we're gonna you know we're
[42:59] gonna speak things when we when we need
[43:01] it and and if we're not careful we
[43:03] become just denominational believers
[43:05] waiting for federal law to come into
[43:08] place waiting for some uh a political
[43:11] move and some political power and things
[43:13] should be starting to tighten up there
[43:14] for us to finally get our act together
[43:16] what is it going to take church
[43:18] is it going to come to it's going to
[43:20] take federal law going around and
[43:22] knocking on your door and and asking you
[43:24] about so he's going to take closing up
[43:26] the church is it going to take your
[43:27] children being taken away from you
[43:29] because they've been documenting
[43:30] everything that's ever been said over
[43:31] this pulpit and they're going to label
[43:33] you and they're going to tell you you're
[43:34] a hair chick and you're a detriment to
[43:36] society and that everything that you
[43:38] believe is poison and we've got to
[43:40] annihilate that and they have caps built
[43:42] up around the towns and they want to
[43:43] take your family and put them are you
[43:45] waiting for that
[43:47] if we're waiting for that i tell you if
[43:49] that time comes it might be too late but
[43:51] i tell you you better get christ sure in
[43:54] your heart right now
[43:57] because if we're not careful we start to
[43:59] look for some type of manufa
[44:01] manifestation in the future
[44:04] brother biscuit said many years ago he
[44:07] said look everybody
[44:08] paraphrased into a sense he said
[44:10] everybody talks about what the third
[44:12] paul's going to be
[44:14] but we know what it is
[44:17] that's the important thing we know what
[44:19] it is
[44:20] we don't have to look into the future
[44:22] and start to wonder well what is it
[44:24] going to be look god reveals his word by
[44:27] what
[44:28] bringing it to past
[44:30] so that we don't have to look out there
[44:32] and wonder but if you're walking in the
[44:33] light as he is in the light and you're
[44:36] walking with him then it doesn't matter
[44:37] what comes your way you're walking with
[44:39] jehovah jireh i'm not looking into the
[44:42] future waiting for something in the
[44:44] future to happen to make me get my act
[44:45] together
[44:47] but if you've been born again if you're
[44:49] walking with the guide if you're walking
[44:50] with jesus christ then he's leading and
[44:53] he's guiding you and if these times come
[44:55] if perilous times come if they start
[44:58] seeking you out if they start hunting
[44:59] you down then if you're walking with him
[45:00] you have everything you have need of he
[45:02] will guide you through the perils he'll
[45:05] guide you through the darkness he'll
[45:06] lead you
[45:08] amen
[45:10] there's no time like the president the
[45:11] prophet says and look away to jesus he
[45:13] said it's tightening
[45:15] and when that time comes and the press
[45:17] comes to a place to where you're pressed
[45:19] out then watch what i'm fixing to tell
[45:20] you in a few minutes watch the third
[45:22] pull then
[45:23] and it'll be absolutely to the totally
[45:25] lost but it will be for the bride and
[45:28] the church
[45:30] so god has given us something
[45:32] and if i could say this just maybe not
[45:34] to leave you out there but we know that
[45:36] the third pool is the opening of the
[45:38] word
[45:40] and we know that the third pool is to
[45:42] the total lost
[45:44] and we know the third pool is the spoken
[45:46] word it's creation we see he said i now
[45:49] know what the third pull is and what it
[45:51] does and so i'm looking at the exploits
[45:54] and what the bride is going to do he's
[45:56] moved us now into the end time message
[45:59] that we received we're not trying to
[46:00] manufacture a as the as god has built up
[46:04] the body he's built up the church ages
[46:06] through justification through
[46:08] sanctification and then the outpouring
[46:10] of against we don't necess we don't do
[46:11] away with those things because god is
[46:13] building up a body but now we're living
[46:15] in the hour of the revealed word where
[46:17] we've been called out from all of those
[46:19] church age ideas and we've been gathered
[46:22] together in christ the word and we've
[46:24] come into here and this is where god
[46:26] wants to manifest his word he wants you
[46:28] to be united with a capstone and in
[46:30] there with his mind that's the exploit
[46:32] and the works that god wants to manifest
[46:35] not looking back to an age gone by and
[46:37] trying to wonder what we can do to
[46:38] resurrect something god's done in the
[46:40] past but looking for what god is doing
[46:42] right now
[46:44] but the people that do know their god
[46:46] shall be strong to do exploits so we're
[46:49] just looking at how he ties those two
[46:51] scriptures together and i want to say if
[46:53] we're going to know our god
[46:55] if we're going to be strong and do
[46:57] exploits
[47:01] then you have to be born again
[47:04] and i want to say it like this there has
[47:05] to come a birth under malachi 4.
[47:08] your birth on the pentecost your birth
[47:10] under denominational it's not going to
[47:12] produce the life that god is looking for
[47:16] he said when i when i come again will i
[47:18] find faith in all the earth
[47:20] will i find faith well god we got the
[47:23] answer will he fight find faith he sent
[47:26] a word to produce a perfect faith
[47:30] he sent himself he came himself and gave
[47:32] us a complete open book that would
[47:35] produce rapturing faith that would
[47:37] produce a perfect faith and that is the
[47:40] faith that he is looking for not a faith
[47:42] of a glare of another age but a faith
[47:45] that the vindicated word in our age has
[47:47] produced and we saw one come to that
[47:49] maturity who is able to stand there on
[47:52] the earth with the third pull and the
[47:54] restoration of the word right there and
[47:56] be able to speak creation
[47:58] be able to speak to the storm what was
[48:00] it that was a great exploit
[48:04] i was fellowshipping with a brother and
[48:05] and he just pondered the question
[48:07] thinking that you know maybe it's going
[48:09] to be uh uh uh uh the the spoken word
[48:12] and the bride that starts to to do
[48:14] miraculous things that gets the
[48:16] government's attention and they really
[48:17] start to hunt us out and close us up and
[48:19] i just thought well you know
[48:21] i just know one thing that the prophet
[48:23] of god said it wasn't a public show and
[48:25] every time that he manifested the third
[48:27] pool it wasn't it wasn't some big thing
[48:30] out there it was something it seemed so
[48:32] simple it would seem so significant
[48:35] little fishy i give you your life back
[48:40] why you know and then and then when he
[48:42] speaks squirrels into existence
[48:49] he's out there by himself
[48:52] and then he goes out there and does it
[48:54] again
[48:55] and so brothers are talking about well
[48:56] where was that seventh one and and i
[48:58] believe he goes back out there and he's
[48:59] looking for it and and any in in it's
[49:02] he's he's looking for this seventh
[49:04] squirrel there's like a little bush
[49:05] there somebody and he's like well where
[49:07] he goes well you speak you say oh yeah
[49:08] it'll be right there and he look there
[49:09] it is
[49:11] and he comes back in now now now there
[49:13] wasn't no big crowd
[49:16] there wasn't a big big gallery that was
[49:18] watching the third pool unfold
[49:21] but no he was in that individual walk
[49:24] with god
[49:25] where those things were being manifested
[49:27] and then he comes back into the house
[49:28] there where there's a few brothers and
[49:30] hatty right and he starts to tell the
[49:32] story well you know what he was right
[49:34] there where i said that and hattie
[49:36] wright said well brother ran on how can
[49:38] that be
[49:39] and he said well
[49:41] all i know
[49:44] is
[49:45] he's still jehovah jireh
[49:47] and just as abraham needed a ram
[49:50] he provided it and she said that's
[49:52] nothing but the truth and her response
[49:55] to the word what did it do it brought
[49:57] hattie right into an atmosphere it
[50:00] brought her under an anointing because
[50:02] she said amen to the word and now she
[50:05] becomes a partaker of that third pool
[50:07] manifestation being set because she said
[50:09] that's nothing but the truth and now the
[50:11] first time you're ever going to see this
[50:14] the prophet would say manifested on a
[50:16] mortal being is that that little poor
[50:18] humble woman sitting there and saying
[50:20] howdy whatever you ask for
[50:23] ask for a million
[50:24] dollars and you'll have it
[50:27] she i believe she even says what should
[50:29] i ask for brother brandon i don't know
[50:30] you got a sick sister that's been in a
[50:32] wheelchair you have you you're poor you
[50:34] need money and i believe brother brandon
[50:36] was even sitting there with twenty
[50:37] dollars in his pocket because she made
[50:40] 200 a year and she had made a donation
[50:42] of 40 for the building fund and one of
[50:45] the brothers said brother branham go
[50:46] ahead and give 20 dollars back to him
[50:48] the prophet was actually
[50:50] was actually going to give her 20
[50:52] dollars back and god spoke to her and
[50:54] said i got something better for her oh
[50:56] my you're looking for finances and
[50:58] you're looking to make a living and
[51:00] you're looking to the world to provide
[51:02] for you but if you'll just give god just
[51:04] give his first just say amen to the lord
[51:07] i say he got something better for you
[51:09] church he got something better than this
[51:10] world can offer he got something better
[51:12] than lady aussie ass he has something
[51:14] better than your job can offer oh he got
[51:17] something better for you he got the
[51:19] revealed word of the hour that if you've
[51:21] been born again you have overcome the
[51:24] world and this is the victory that
[51:26] overcomes the world even your faith that
[51:28] comes by the revealing of the word in
[51:30] this hour that will produce a body
[51:32] change it will produce a rapture it will
[51:35] produce a perfect faith that you can put
[51:37] every devil under your feet oh i'm
[51:39] talking about a bride that is victorious
[51:42] in the name of jesus christ
[51:44] oh
[51:45] glory to god you might think i'm a
[51:46] little fanatical you might think i'm a
[51:48] little crazy but something has started
[51:51] there has been a reaction that has
[51:52] started inside of me it is something i
[51:55] can't stop it is changing me little by
[51:58] little step by step and one of these
[52:00] days i'm going to take my last step i'm
[52:03] going to be changed in a moment in a
[52:05] twinkling of an eye i'm going to be gone
[52:08] why because i've received this message
[52:10] in this hour oh it's a great word it's a
[52:13] great message if you can just say that's
[52:15] nothing but the truth oh hallelujah
[52:18] praise his name hallelujah there's
[52:20] something that has been opened up to the
[52:22] bride and i say it's under this message
[52:24] that you've got to be born again
[52:28] oh we got to be washed
[52:30] by the water of the word
[52:32] you can't hold on to your way of
[52:34] thinking
[52:36] you can't hold on to your way of doing
[52:38] things
[52:39] but if you walk
[52:41] with him
[52:43] and he is the word
[52:45] and his word is the guide
[52:49] it's the message
[52:51] it's what's leading you and guiding you
[52:53] through this lady ought to see your age
[52:56] and leading you into the body change
[52:59] but as soon as we start to lean at our
[53:02] own thinking and lean on our own
[53:04] standing then we start to separate
[53:06] ourselves from the guy
[53:10] and you know what's so special about
[53:11] this guide
[53:13] when you make a right hand turn do you
[53:14] want to go do your thing
[53:16] he'll follow behind you
[53:18] and he'll wait
[53:20] you'll get out there you'll make this
[53:21] turn you'll make that turn you'll get
[53:23] yourself in all of a kind of a mess and
[53:25] a situation oh but when you get there if
[53:28] you'll finally repent and you'll just
[53:30] look away to jesus and turn back around
[53:33] you'll find him faithful he's been there
[53:35] all the time and you'll just say lord
[53:37] jesus i'm sorry lord forgive me and
[53:40] you'll say lord son i love you i paid
[53:42] the price on calvary why don't you just
[53:44] take me by the hand and what he'll do
[53:46] he'll start leading you back
[53:48] he'll start leading you back and get you
[53:50] right back on the right track he'll take
[53:52] all the permissive will he'll take all
[53:54] your wrongs and he'll make every single
[53:56] one of them right oh what a blessed word
[53:59] what a blessed consolation to know we
[54:01] serve a god that's so great
[54:03] that could give you a revelation and say
[54:05] you're justified you never did it in the
[54:07] first place
[54:08] oh my
[54:10] oh hallelujah
[54:12] oh you talk about a victory
[54:15] i feel that many times we're struggling
[54:17] to catch the revelation of justification
[54:21] there is no way
[54:22] that you have caught
[54:24] the revelation of true
[54:27] justification from another age that was
[54:30] a partial truth
[54:33] that was a partial truth
[54:35] but jesus christ came in our generation
[54:38] and said you're justified that means you
[54:40] never did it in the first place you talk
[54:44] about redemption he wants to take you
[54:47] back to where you were in the very
[54:49] beginning to take you out of any other
[54:51] sin condition where anybody that would
[54:54] come and try to tell you oh jackson i
[54:56] saw you living out the way you you did
[54:57] all this out in the world and if they
[54:59] could stand right there before then say
[55:01] that the lord you go i don't know what
[55:02] you're talking about can you imagine how
[55:04] mad that makes the devil when he goes to
[55:06] accuse you before the lord and he tries
[55:09] to tell him about your faults and about
[55:11] your failures and here's god that knows
[55:13] everything
[55:14] he knows everything about every single
[55:17] situation and the devil knows that and
[55:20] he comes up an accuser of the brother
[55:23] and he says look at sister so-and-so do
[55:25] you know what she did you remember she
[55:27] did it she did oh yeah the other day she
[55:29] was over at that friend's house and this
[55:31] is what happened and she started to do
[55:33] this and that and he looks right at him
[55:34] and goes
[55:35] no
[55:37] i i i don't know what you're talking
[55:39] about
[55:40] you imagine how mad that makes the devil
[55:43] when he tries to go and god see a
[55:45] forgetfulness but you know there's a
[55:47] sign there that says no fishing saints
[55:49] if we have been born again if we have
[55:51] been forgiven then there is now no
[55:54] condemnation to them who are in christ
[55:57] jesus talk about a happy birthday
[55:59] blessed is the man in whom the lord will
[56:02] not impute sin that's what we're happy
[56:05] about that's why we're excited because
[56:07] we have been forgiven we have been
[56:09] justified the holy spirit has sanctified
[56:12] our our lives and our vessels and he's
[56:14] brought us into a fellowship with the
[56:16] holy ghost oh glory to god
[56:20] oh hallelujah oh i just can't help at
[56:23] church i know what i used to be
[56:25] i know what i used to do but oh when you
[56:27] experience the loving tender hand of
[56:29] almighty god how could you ever look
[56:31] down on another individual how could you
[56:33] ever look down on somebody else that's
[56:35] out there and sin when you know what you
[56:37] used to be but god rich in mercy we're
[56:40] in this great love that he loved us
[56:43] reached down his hand and pulled you up
[56:45] out of the mucking mire when you've
[56:46] experienced that type of love you want
[56:48] everybody else you come in contact with
[56:50] to experience that same kind of love
[56:53] oh you shall know
[56:56] they are my disciples
[56:58] by their love one for
[57:01] the person who always takes care of you
[57:03] and and always is lifting you up and
[57:05] always complimenting you and and and why
[57:08] wouldn't you cater to him
[57:11] no by your love one for another
[57:14] just another
[57:16] why don't you just show the love of god
[57:17] to another
[57:20] to common man
[57:22] to another human being
[57:24] especially those of the household of
[57:26] faith
[57:28] oh my there's something
[57:30] that has taken place
[57:31] because faith is a revelation
[57:34] faith
[57:35] is a victory
[57:37] that overcometh the world
[57:39] it's our faith and there is a people
[57:41] that know god
[57:43] that's the scripture that says they
[57:45] shall know their god
[57:47] they will be strong and they will do
[57:50] exploits there's a people that know to
[57:52] god when you look out at the world and
[57:54] you know that that 200 million demons
[57:56] have been loosed at the river euphrates
[58:00] and we're seeing the depth of sin
[58:03] we're we're seeing things now coming
[58:05] into the human beings and the acts that
[58:09] are there that are being committed are
[58:11] really if you're in it's incapable of
[58:14] comprehending
[58:17] what would what would overtake somebody
[58:19] and how that these things could be i was
[58:21] at work and my secretary asked me there
[58:24] there was a a big thing on the news
[58:26] about a a young couple and
[58:29] and it's just one of those news stories
[58:30] where unfortunately they went by the way
[58:33] of the the grave and and she goes i just
[58:35] want to know what happened
[58:37] i just want to know why i said you know
[58:39] it's that kind of thinking that'll drive
[58:40] you crazy
[58:42] i said it's that kind of thinking
[58:43] that'll destroy you when you start to
[58:45] think upon those things and you meditate
[58:47] and you start to wonder well why was
[58:49] this why was it that you know the world
[58:51] you you can't comprehend that wickedness
[58:54] out there
[58:55] it's it's demon evil spirits that are
[58:57] pressing their cells into flesh
[59:02] look if you if you if you could see the
[59:04] news and the things and i don't
[59:06] recommend it where where the things that
[59:08] were committed and and they were news
[59:10] breaking now it's just commonplace it's
[59:13] happening all the time and then now the
[59:15] age limit's getting lower and lower and
[59:17] lower to where where you're finding out
[59:19] that eight-year-olds are committing
[59:20] suicide and things are taking place and
[59:23] you wonder oh my goodness how could it
[59:25] be that bad where a young child would
[59:29] take that in into their own hands and
[59:32] take their own life but you know if if
[59:34] the wickedness has gotten so dark and
[59:36] it's so dark out there where where where
[59:39] where you know
[59:40] the devil's pressing himself and the
[59:42] people like that and they have their
[59:44] movie stars and and there's these
[59:45] anointing and people are hearing voices
[59:47] and they're hearing demons and they're
[59:49] worshiping their sex queens and they
[59:51] have their so-called superstars and
[59:53] everything trust me they know the god of
[59:55] this evil age
[59:58] they worship when they they're seeing
[59:59] the fruits of the way they're living
[1:00:02] and look the denominationals are no
[1:00:04] different
[1:00:06] oh come on the the jesus said these
[1:00:09] people in matthew 15 80 said this people
[1:00:11] draweth my enemy with their mouth
[1:00:13] and honor me with their lips but their
[1:00:15] hearts is far from me
[1:00:17] but in vain
[1:00:19] do they worship me
[1:00:22] teaching for the doctrine the
[1:00:23] commandments of men in vain do they
[1:00:26] worship him
[1:00:27] well i got news
[1:00:29] there's a group of people that have
[1:00:31] gathered together in bedford texas
[1:00:33] tonight
[1:00:34] and they are not worshiping the lord god
[1:00:36] in vain
[1:00:38] oh no there's plenty of households out
[1:00:41] there a plenty of churches that have
[1:00:42] gathered around the dallas fort worth uh
[1:00:45] a metroplex and in vain do they worship
[1:00:48] me teaching the doctrines of the
[1:00:50] commandments of man oh but there's a
[1:00:52] little place where a people have
[1:00:54] gathered together under the revealed
[1:00:56] word of the hour and he said i seek
[1:00:58] those to worship me those that will
[1:01:00] worship me in spirit and in truth and we
[1:01:04] have received a truth and this hour that
[1:01:06] has introduced us to our lord jesus
[1:01:08] christ and the word says where two or
[1:01:10] three are gathered i'll be in their
[1:01:12] midst i want to tell you jesus christ is
[1:01:15] here he inhabits the praises of his
[1:01:17] people you didn't come in here leading
[1:01:19] songs in vain you didn't come here
[1:01:21] lifting up your hands in vain you didn't
[1:01:23] come in here wondering if god was going
[1:01:25] to be here but you got a divine promise
[1:01:28] that jesus christ is here in the
[1:01:29] building tonight
[1:01:31] i ask you then what do you have need of
[1:01:33] what is it that's troubling you
[1:01:36] oh we worship our lord jesus in spirit
[1:01:39] and in truth and by divine promise he is
[1:01:42] right here
[1:01:44] he is right here right now
[1:01:47] oh but we see all this wickedness
[1:01:49] we see the wickedness of man but the
[1:01:51] scripture says when the enemy shall come
[1:01:53] in like a flood the spirit of the lord
[1:01:55] shall lift up a standard against him
[1:01:58] oh it's dark all around
[1:02:00] it looks like there's no way out
[1:02:03] oh this god forsaken land it's evil
[1:02:07] plagued by death and by disease
[1:02:10] by lust
[1:02:12] but the spirit of god has come upon you
[1:02:16] by his word
[1:02:17] to lift you up
[1:02:19] to lift you out of
[1:02:21] the prophet would take psalms 27 5 and
[1:02:23] say for in the time of trouble
[1:02:25] he shall hide me in his pavilion
[1:02:28] in the secret place of his tabernacle he
[1:02:30] shall hide me he shall set me up upon a
[1:02:33] rock notice he says i will set you up
[1:02:35] upon a rock
[1:02:37] that's the rock of revelation that he
[1:02:38] set you up on
[1:02:42] where they came when when they when
[1:02:43] jesus asked him say who who do they say
[1:02:45] i the son of man in
[1:02:47] well someday i'll say that or jonas some
[1:02:48] say that are elias some some say thou
[1:02:50] art elijah
[1:02:53] but who do you
[1:02:56] who do you say i am
[1:03:00] that's a question
[1:03:02] that we need to ask ourselves
[1:03:05] what are we following
[1:03:06] what do we believe in
[1:03:08] what do you say
[1:03:10] this message is
[1:03:11] what do you say malachi 4 5 was
[1:03:14] what was revelations
[1:03:16] 10 1-7
[1:03:18] is it buzz phrase is it catch phrase
[1:03:20] just to get the people excited
[1:03:22] it was is it is it our cult is it our
[1:03:24] little clique we believe a prophet
[1:03:27] we're going in a rapture
[1:03:30] oh we might just be good baptist
[1:03:32] we might just be good pentecostal
[1:03:35] but you might want to ask yourself in
[1:03:36] your heart
[1:03:39] the lord is speaking to you who do you
[1:03:40] say i
[1:03:43] the son of man
[1:03:45] and there comes a revelation
[1:03:48] that'll break out in your heart
[1:03:51] where when you meet the lord jesus
[1:03:53] christ just like paul was struck down
[1:03:55] there on the road to damascus
[1:03:59] he says saul it's hard to kick against
[1:04:01] the prick
[1:04:02] maybe you're going through that maybe
[1:04:04] you're struggling maybe you're fighting
[1:04:06] maybe you wonder why things are going
[1:04:07] the way they are maybe you ought to say
[1:04:09] lord who are
[1:04:10] you i am jesus whom thou persecutest
[1:04:15] what happened there came a revelation
[1:04:17] and paul had to be born again there came
[1:04:21] a translation in paul's life where he
[1:04:23] came to the revelation that he knew
[1:04:25] who that was he knew that was none other
[1:04:28] than jesus christ and i invite you to
[1:04:31] take a look at the word and see what
[1:04:33] we've heard and what has been manifested
[1:04:35] and asked the quest who do you say this
[1:04:38] is who do you say i the son of man in
[1:04:40] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:04:43] living god oh when you meet him it'll
[1:04:45] change you it'll change out the way you
[1:04:48] think and the way you act you'll become
[1:04:50] a new creature in jesus christ old
[1:04:52] things will pass away all things will
[1:04:54] become new
[1:04:56] oh that's the revelation
[1:04:58] of this hour that we're walking in
[1:05:02] the prophet says
[1:05:04] don't fear little sister
[1:05:07] there is a man here who can turn on the
[1:05:08] light
[1:05:11] oh my with all this darkness maybe you
[1:05:13] feel like it's dark maybe you feel like
[1:05:15] it's hopeless
[1:05:16] don't fear little sister there's a man
[1:05:18] here who can turn on the light he can
[1:05:21] make this word live
[1:05:24] that's what we need church
[1:05:28] we need the guide
[1:05:31] we need the lord jesus christ
[1:05:33] there is a man here who can turn on the
[1:05:35] light he can make this word live the
[1:05:39] problem is we've been trying to make it
[1:05:40] live
[1:05:42] the problem is we've been trying to make
[1:05:44] this message live with our efforts and
[1:05:46] our ideas and our understanding and with
[1:05:49] our works and it can't live through your
[1:05:52] abilities it can't live through your
[1:05:54] knowledge it can't live through your
[1:05:56] understanding oh my but when you meet
[1:05:59] him there is a man here that can turn on
[1:06:02] the light and he will make this message
[1:06:05] live
[1:06:06] we don't know how he's coming we don't
[1:06:09] know when he's coming i don't know
[1:06:11] nothing about it
[1:06:13] but
[1:06:14] he
[1:06:16] is
[1:06:16] here
[1:06:18] it's like quit worrying about uh
[1:06:21] sometimes we get our mind in such a
[1:06:23] pickle wondering well is the coming of
[1:06:25] the lord in 63 or is the coming of the
[1:06:27] lord it's going to be the meeting in the
[1:06:29] air and the third pool will it's
[1:06:31] speaking creation and oh my goodness the
[1:06:33] feds are gonna have to hunt us up and
[1:06:35] then when that starts happening it gets
[1:06:37] really tight and i thought it was gonna
[1:06:38] happen here they closed down our church
[1:06:40] but then that wasn't the prophecies of
[1:06:41] field so maybe we'll wait for the
[1:06:43] prophecy to be filled and then we'll
[1:06:44] start getting the squeeze
[1:06:46] and then maybe these are going to be the
[1:06:47] things that you know and then he's going
[1:06:48] to come hey no look you don't have to
[1:06:51] worry about all that he's here
[1:06:53] he's here
[1:06:55] a vindicated prophet
[1:06:57] malachi 4.
[1:06:59] looks like the son of man ministry god
[1:07:02] coming down and taking a man's vessel
[1:07:05] and stepped into it and said i'm here
[1:07:08] i'm here don't you don't have to fear
[1:07:10] little sister i'm here i can turn on the
[1:07:13] light i'll chase away the darkness
[1:07:15] whatever you're going through i'll walk
[1:07:16] with you
[1:07:18] oh he's here you don't have to try to
[1:07:20] figure it out if you'll just pray
[1:07:25] listen to the word
[1:07:27] be in fellowship
[1:07:29] shun the appearance of evil do the
[1:07:31] simple things and walk with jehovah
[1:07:34] jiren he'll provide all those things
[1:07:36] that you have need of
[1:07:39] oh the prophet said this so plainly
[1:07:42] well i don't know how we he's coming
[1:07:44] well i don't know when he's coming
[1:07:46] i don't know nothing about it but he is
[1:07:48] here
[1:07:50] he can turn on the lights
[1:07:53] how are we going to get out of it
[1:07:55] i don't know
[1:07:58] but he's here
[1:07:59] everybody wants to know how are we going
[1:08:01] to get out of kovic
[1:08:02] how is this all going to get back
[1:08:04] together
[1:08:05] look if any of us are honest with
[1:08:07] ourselves we kind of want this whole
[1:08:08] thing to get put back together
[1:08:11] kind of want this whole
[1:08:13] vaccination thing and this whole uh
[1:08:16] pandemic thing just to go away so we can
[1:08:18] keep living our nice comfortable lives
[1:08:20] it was just so much better before that
[1:08:23] thing happened
[1:08:25] i was just kind of things were easier
[1:08:30] and if we're not careful we jump on the
[1:08:31] bandwagon
[1:08:32] trump was back in the office this is
[1:08:34] this biden guy he's the reason why it's
[1:08:36] all happening you know they need to do
[1:08:38] this and they need to build a boy
[1:08:40] come on
[1:08:42] do you think those puppets are having
[1:08:44] anything to do to control the signs and
[1:08:47] times
[1:08:48] no there's only two powers that's the
[1:08:50] power of god and that's the power of
[1:08:53] satan and the power of satan is having
[1:08:55] control over his evil he can only do as
[1:08:58] much as god allows them to do
[1:09:01] and he's just a puppet in the hands of
[1:09:03] god god just allows him to go so far he
[1:09:05] just allows them to do this even in your
[1:09:07] own life the prophet of god said he's
[1:09:10] the great shepherd that sits at the gate
[1:09:12] and no sin no sickness nothing can ever
[1:09:15] come upon your life unless the great
[1:09:18] shepherd permits it and he if he has
[1:09:20] permitted it he has allowed it for your
[1:09:22] good it's going to bring good into your
[1:09:24] life it's going to work out a character
[1:09:26] it's going to work out a gold in you
[1:09:29] it's going to be something that has an
[1:09:31] eternal weight of glory oh you can just
[1:09:33] look that old devil say watch out devil
[1:09:35] the character of god is being formed in
[1:09:38] my life every blow of the enemy every
[1:09:41] death everything that he throws at you
[1:09:43] oh it cannot affect you because you're
[1:09:45] in the bosom of jesus christ he's
[1:09:47] allowing those things to move into your
[1:09:49] life that will bring out the character
[1:09:51] of christ in you
[1:09:54] there's a character in you that you
[1:09:55] don't even know you have
[1:09:59] there is a part of god in there
[1:10:01] that's doing exploits
[1:10:05] you know why you're here tonight
[1:10:08] because god kept you
[1:10:10] this ain't something you've done church
[1:10:13] we ain't a bunch of denominational
[1:10:15] believers who got some form of ideas and
[1:10:18] we've formed some clique and came here
[1:10:20] none other than almighty god has kept
[1:10:22] your life he has saved you he has
[1:10:24] redeemed you he put a pool on your heart
[1:10:27] and he's trolled you here that he could
[1:10:29] speak to your heart
[1:10:32] oh i didn't give it up a long time ago
[1:10:34] i've sat in my bedroom and felt i was
[1:10:37] losing my mind
[1:10:40] and i said oh god
[1:10:42] i don't know what to do where would i go
[1:10:47] lord i don't know where to turn i don't
[1:10:49] know where to go
[1:10:53] but where could i go
[1:10:56] thou o lord thou hast the words of
[1:10:59] eternal life
[1:11:01] god's the one that's keeping you there
[1:11:03] is a life inside of you an eternal uh uh
[1:11:07] attribute of god that has been placed
[1:11:10] there and he is actually allowing this
[1:11:12] time to bring out the fruits of that
[1:11:14] seed that he put there
[1:11:16] if we'll just yield to it
[1:11:18] we'll just surrender to it
[1:11:21] just like abraham he was walking with
[1:11:22] jehovah jireh
[1:11:24] he didn't know what was going to happen
[1:11:26] he was just being obedient to the word
[1:11:30] and he got up on that mountain
[1:11:33] and the prophet of god said look look
[1:11:35] who spoke that ram
[1:11:37] jehovah jairus spoke that round
[1:11:40] you keep walking with god
[1:11:42] if you have need of something
[1:11:44] you have the spoken word
[1:11:46] that'll provide you with every need that
[1:11:48] you have
[1:11:49] if you'll just surrender to it if you'll
[1:11:51] just feed on it if you'll just believe

[1:13:59] i say there's somebody here tonight that
[1:14:01] just maybe needs the joy of their
[1:14:02] salvation back
[1:14:05] oh because when i start to think about
[1:14:07] what he did for me
[1:14:09] you might be going through a spell
[1:14:11] you might be going through a hard time
[1:14:14] but david said restore unto me the joy
[1:14:17] of my salvation maybe you've gotten a
[1:14:19] little weary and you've gotten tired
[1:14:21] you've even started to doubt your own
[1:14:23] experience
[1:14:26] that's okay we go through times like
[1:14:29] that
[1:14:31] you know it was it was it was
[1:14:33] this day 85 years ago
[1:14:37] that brother branham and his
[1:14:39] wife hope
[1:14:41] welcome sharon rose into the world
[1:14:44] 85 years ago today october 27th
[1:14:47] and what a joy
[1:14:49] that would have been
[1:14:51] to have his baby girl but little did he
[1:14:53] know nine months later
[1:14:55] nine months later he'd be standing there
[1:14:56] in the hospital
[1:14:58] looking at his little sharon rose and
[1:15:01] her ledge twitching in her eyes going
[1:15:03] across
[1:15:05] his wife laying there in the morning
[1:15:06] three days later three days earlier
[1:15:11] and then the devil come
[1:15:13] start telling them yeah
[1:15:15] this is the kind of god you serve
[1:15:19] the prophet said you couldn't couldn't
[1:15:20] tell me it wasn't real i've done seen
[1:15:21] too much
[1:15:22] or maybe you've seen a lot maybe you
[1:15:24] know god's real but the devil keeps
[1:15:25] trying to come to you and say you ain't
[1:15:26] got what you think you got
[1:15:28] you just ain't the bride
[1:15:30] you ain't bright material
[1:15:32] you better just start hoping you can be
[1:15:34] foolish virgin
[1:15:35] oh
[1:15:36] oh my i guarantee you said it to
[1:15:38] somebody here well no you might not go
[1:15:40] in the rapture but maybe you you'll just
[1:15:42] you'll just uh maybe you'll go in by
[1:15:44] being good to the bride
[1:15:47] and then the prophet is he's discouraged
[1:15:48] the prophet of god said that whenever
[1:15:50] you get discouraged that's when the
[1:15:52] devil really poured on you
[1:15:55] and there in that discouragement
[1:15:58] there in that heartache
[1:16:00] there looking at his little baby girl
[1:16:03] just nine months old and her little eyes
[1:16:04] crossed over
[1:16:06] heartbroken and near the devil you went
[1:16:08] to pray to god in that black curtain
[1:16:10] just come down
[1:16:12] you better know what you're talking
[1:16:13] about then
[1:16:18] but even brother branham and himself
[1:16:22] said you know what
[1:16:24] then we'll keep telling where your
[1:16:25] brother's died your mom has died
[1:16:27] we're not your mom or your daddy you've
[1:16:28] packed them away and and he starts going
[1:16:30] down the list
[1:16:34] and he finally said you know
[1:16:36] what it is he don't love you
[1:16:38] brother braham said you know it's just
[1:16:40] about that time well if that's the way
[1:16:41] it is i'll just quit
[1:16:43] but right when he started to have that
[1:16:45] thought he said oh
[1:16:47] there was something that caught
[1:16:49] there was an anchor
[1:16:51] there is something that cut and out of
[1:16:54] that darkness something said no he's
[1:16:56] slain
[1:16:58] yet i will trust him why it wasn't
[1:17:01] william branham that was living it was
[1:17:03] none other than the lord jesus christ
[1:17:06] that was living in him that in his
[1:17:08] darkest trial there was something there
[1:17:10] keeping him when he would have quit
[1:17:13] god was there to keep him and i want to
[1:17:16] tell you you might feel run down you
[1:17:18] might feel weary you might be
[1:17:20] questioning your own experience oh but
[1:17:22] there is something inside of you that is
[1:17:25] keeping you when even in yourself you
[1:17:27] would want to throw in the towel even
[1:17:29] when you would want to quit and give up
[1:17:31] and many of us have been there but
[1:17:33] something in your heart there is an
[1:17:35] anchor that is keeping you and it's
[1:17:38] going to take you to the end
[1:17:40] oh praise his wonderful name there is a
[1:17:43] man that can turn on the light oh like
[1:17:45] david would say the lord is my light and
[1:17:47] my salvation whom shall i fear the lord
[1:17:51] is the strength of my life and whom
[1:17:53] shall i be afraid when the wicked
[1:17:55] hallelujah when the wicked even my
[1:17:58] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:18:00] up my flesh they stumble and fail though
[1:18:03] in host should have kept against me my
[1:18:05] heart shall not fear the war should rise
[1:18:08] against me and this will i be confident
[1:18:11] one thing i have desired of the lord
[1:18:13] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:18:15] in the house of the lord all the days of
[1:18:17] my life to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:18:20] and to inquire in his temple for in the
[1:18:22] time of trouble
[1:18:26] living in a time of trouble church

[1:19:11] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:19:13] my enemies round about me therefore will
[1:19:16] i offer in this tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:19:19] joy
[1:19:20] i will sing yay
[1:19:23] i will sing praises unto the lord you're
[1:19:25] not worshiping in vain church oh the
[1:19:27] mighty angel christ has descended to

[1:19:47] upon a rock
[1:19:48] the revelation of the opening of this
[1:19:50] word in our day

[1:19:53] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:19:54] death i will fear no evil
[1:19:57] oh thou art with me thy rod and thy
[1:19:59] staff they comfort me that prepares to
[1:20:01] table before me in the presence of mine
[1:20:03] enemies

[1:20:09] me all the days of my life
[1:20:11] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:20:13] lord
[1:20:15] forever
[1:20:17] oh the bride is doing exploits
[1:20:20] she's walking in the light
[1:20:22] we'll just come to a close here in about
[1:20:24] 15 minutes
[1:20:25] we'll just
[1:20:26] by god's help just
[1:20:28] close out on this line of
[1:20:30] thought but the bride is doing exploits
[1:20:33] because she's heard the shout
[1:20:36] she's heard the message of the hour
[1:20:38] she's been impregnated with the word
[1:20:41] what do the prophets say the the word is
[1:20:43] here is the secret
[1:20:44] the word is in the bride
[1:20:47] she has the mind of christ
[1:20:50] she has thus saith the lord or she
[1:20:52] stands still you know what it struck me
[1:20:54] about this she she has the mind of
[1:20:55] christ we're always looking at that like
[1:20:58] it's a database
[1:21:00] like my goodness i've got 1100 sermons
[1:21:02] that i got to memorize
[1:21:04] i got a whole book from genesis to
[1:21:05] revelation and if i can just memorize
[1:21:08] all of these things i'll have the mind
[1:21:10] of christ
[1:21:14] you know that's where people get
[1:21:15] themselves in trouble
[1:21:18] self-taught
[1:21:21] complicated
[1:21:23] you know you know where people get
[1:21:24] themselves into trouble they
[1:21:26] they
[1:21:27] they read a book like
[1:21:29] okay yeah i'll go into the woods and
[1:21:32] i can just yeah if you just cut down
[1:21:33] these sticks and everything and
[1:21:35] you know i read the book
[1:21:38] i'm gonna go do it
[1:21:40] and people they they they they're
[1:21:42] self-learners they read a book
[1:21:44] and then they go out in the woods or
[1:21:45] they go somewhere and they think that
[1:21:46] they're just gonna go reproduce
[1:21:50] what the author of the book was was able
[1:21:52] to pin down and they don't realize the
[1:21:55] years
[1:21:56] the training
[1:21:58] they don't realize
[1:21:59] how many times he messed up to get it
[1:22:02] right you don't know how many storms he
[1:22:04] weathered and how many things that's
[1:22:06] that's the problem of the church we read
[1:22:08] we read the word like it's a database
[1:22:10] and then we're just going to go out
[1:22:11] there and live it
[1:22:14] but you know what i i don't i if if you
[1:22:17] got the author of the book
[1:22:21] if you just go out there with the guide
[1:22:24] if he is with you
[1:22:25] then you you don't have to memorize
[1:22:27] everything i mean you try to re memorize
[1:22:30] the road map and you try to make it all
[1:22:32] on your own but if the guide is with you
[1:22:34] he's there teaching you he's there
[1:22:36] leading you he's there guiding you he's
[1:22:38] there walking you through all of those
[1:22:39] things where you don't have to rely on
[1:22:41] your own ability oh but the mind of
[1:22:43] christ is to allow the word to become a
[1:22:46] revelation allow it to be revealed to
[1:22:48] you that you just continue to walk with
[1:22:49] him be in prayer waiting on the mind of
[1:22:52] god waiting on the word of god waiting
[1:22:54] for him to reveal himself to you oh if
[1:22:56] you're doing something wrong he'll
[1:22:58] convict you he'll condemn you he
[1:22:59] surrounded you with the family of god
[1:23:01] he's given you a pastor that you can
[1:23:03] talk to he's giving you brothers and
[1:23:04] sisters oh god has surrounded you and
[1:23:07] equipped you with everything you have
[1:23:09] need of in this journey
[1:23:11] he's given you malachi 4 5.
[1:23:14] he's giving you the revealed word of the
[1:23:15] hour he's given you access to the holy
[1:23:17] ghost to be filled with the holy ghost
[1:23:19] and if you got the message you got the
[1:23:20] word of god you got the family god what
[1:23:23] else do you have need of church
[1:23:25] you don't have to fear you don't have to
[1:23:27] worry you don't have to be upset there's
[1:23:29] a man here that can turn on the light
[1:23:32] oh don't be conformed but but be
[1:23:34] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:23:38] the prophet says that life only comes by
[1:23:40] the word made manifest
[1:23:43] as long as it's just in a book like this
[1:23:47] it still can be questioned
[1:23:50] there it is
[1:23:53] as long as the message remains on tapes
[1:23:57] and books it can be questioned
[1:24:02] that's why you're his victory
[1:24:04] that's why you are the vindication
[1:24:08] because malachi 4 was sent to get a
[1:24:11] bride
[1:24:14] if there was no bride
[1:24:16] there would still be a waiting for a
[1:24:18] manifestation
[1:24:20] or a vindication of the message that was
[1:24:22] sent to a bride but we're here we've
[1:24:24] received it behold i send you elijah
[1:24:28] you're the you that received elijah you
[1:24:30] are the vindication of the message
[1:24:36] so that all of the things that have been
[1:24:38] spoken is for you you're the bride
[1:24:41] without spot without wrinkle you never
[1:24:44] we've heard all of those things over and
[1:24:46] over and over and i wonder if it's
[1:24:47] become dead letter to us
[1:24:49] and we keep doubting our calling we keep
[1:24:52] doubting our election we keep getting
[1:24:54] pushed down and we have to go and have
[1:24:56] people build back up our self-esteem
[1:24:58] what is this there is a man here that
[1:25:00] can turn on the light you're walking
[1:25:02] with jesus christ
[1:25:05] you have everything you have need of
[1:25:10] he says in paragraph 190 and today the
[1:25:12] church ought to be jesus christ in
[1:25:14] action upon the earth
[1:25:16] because i live you live also
[1:25:19] and my life will be in you
[1:25:21] the works that i do you'll do also see
[1:25:23] the church has got to get to that place
[1:25:26] and he promised he would do it
[1:25:28] it has to come that way
[1:25:30] it got to be that way
[1:25:32] and he starts talking about noah i know
[1:25:34] it was the light in his day
[1:25:36] and we'll just end on this subject right
[1:25:38] here that
[1:25:40] noah was the light in his day and he
[1:25:42] came and he preached that god was going
[1:25:44] to judge the world by water and he said
[1:25:47] that that uh
[1:25:48] uh
[1:25:50] there's gonna be a big boat
[1:25:51] we're gonna have to get on this boat the
[1:25:53] animals are gonna come in two by two
[1:25:54] this is god's ark of safety that was his
[1:25:57] message and you know noah moved by faith
[1:25:59] with fear and built an ark they could
[1:26:01] have questioned moses's message
[1:26:03] but then when the boat was built they
[1:26:05] couldn't question that part
[1:26:07] then when the animals came in two by two
[1:26:09] they couldn't question that part
[1:26:11] and then when the rain started to fall
[1:26:12] they couldn't question that part
[1:26:14] you know that's what's happening right
[1:26:16] now bride
[1:26:18] modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:26:22] after prophecy being fulfilled
[1:26:25] all around us
[1:26:27] and that's the light of the hour so here
[1:26:29] moses think about this now this is this
[1:26:31] is really where i wanted to move to this
[1:26:33] is my message right here so
[1:26:36] we'll make a strong push here just a few
[1:26:38] minutes so that was the light and that
[1:26:41] noah was the light now i was just
[1:26:42] looking at this moses right god calls
[1:26:45] moses and now moses is the light he's
[1:26:48] the light to call the children of israel
[1:26:49] out and god vindicates them by signs and
[1:26:52] wonders led by a pillar of fire in a
[1:26:53] cloud by day and i just as i saw this
[1:26:55] visually i just saw and like here here's
[1:26:58] god's people and the message of moses
[1:27:00] and there's there's light
[1:27:02] just as there was light and gosh and
[1:27:03] there's light there's light in egypt but
[1:27:05] now as god continues to move the
[1:27:07] children of israel on just like the
[1:27:10] church ages the light just starts to
[1:27:12] move it's moving now out of egypt
[1:27:14] it's moving now into the wilderness and
[1:27:16] and almost you could just picture a map
[1:27:18] with a little lamp on it you could just
[1:27:19] see this this beamy light just moving
[1:27:22] right it's just moving now it's into the
[1:27:24] wilderness and now it's crossing it's
[1:27:25] coming up it's coming up to the to the
[1:27:28] the uh to the jordan river there
[1:27:31] and now the light's coming to the jordan
[1:27:32] river and god has gathered his mighty
[1:27:34] prophet to him and now the commission's
[1:27:36] going to go on through joshua a type of
[1:27:38] the holy ghost and now the light's going
[1:27:40] to cross over
[1:27:42] and now that light it's approaching
[1:27:44] jericho
[1:27:46] and it comes to the city jericho and and
[1:27:48] there just happens to be in this city
[1:27:51] jericho
[1:27:52] a lady by the name of rahab
[1:27:55] a harlot
[1:27:57] and she she notices there's some spies
[1:27:59] that have that have come from the camp
[1:28:01] of israel and she receives them into her
[1:28:03] home
[1:28:04] and she receives them into a home and
[1:28:06] and and and the king had noticed that
[1:28:09] she had received him and they sent uh
[1:28:11] messengers there to find out those those
[1:28:13] spies that had come in and they inquired
[1:28:15] and she said oh no she'd hit him up on
[1:28:17] the rooftop and the flax and oh no
[1:28:18] they're not here and and and then they
[1:28:20] went on and she starts to testify to him
[1:28:22] she's like you know what
[1:28:24] we've heard about your god
[1:28:27] we've heard how we dried up the red sea
[1:28:29] we heard about what he did to the
[1:28:30] amorites
[1:28:32] and all the men of the city man their
[1:28:33] hearts are fainting that you're gone
[1:28:36] oh she started saying i know you're
[1:28:37] god's real
[1:28:39] oh i just i can't i just know there's
[1:28:42] something real about it
[1:28:44] about your god and i i i and i've heard
[1:28:46] of all the testimonies and everything i
[1:28:48] want to ask you
[1:28:50] will you give me a token
[1:28:53] because of the kindness that i show to
[1:28:54] you
[1:28:57] and those spies looked at her and they
[1:28:58] said yes well
[1:29:00] all right
[1:29:01] we'll give you token shields i want a
[1:29:03] token
[1:29:04] but i want that token i want it for my
[1:29:06] mama
[1:29:07] i want it for my daddy
[1:29:09] i want it for my brother
[1:29:10] i want it for my sister
[1:29:12] i want it for them relatives i want it
[1:29:14] for all of my father's house
[1:29:17] oh i got to thinking about that
[1:29:20] because she had received those spies and
[1:29:22] she had asked for a token because she
[1:29:24] believed the message that they were
[1:29:25] preaching something inside and said i've
[1:29:27] heard about what your god done i've
[1:29:29] heard about the exploits over there at
[1:29:31] the ranch i've heard about the exploits
[1:29:34] in egypt i've heard about the exploits
[1:29:37] there in the wilderness and oh my give
[1:29:39] me a true token that i might be saved by
[1:29:42] my family and i might be saved and they
[1:29:44] say we'll give you a token by this
[1:29:46] scarlet thread that you've let us down
[1:29:48] out of the window
[1:29:50] that'll be a token
[1:29:52] oh my if rahab a harlot
[1:29:55] could receive two spies
[1:29:58] under the commission of joshua
[1:30:00] and she would have enough faith to ask
[1:30:01] for a mama and her daddy and her
[1:30:04] brothers and her sisters and all of her
[1:30:06] father's house what about a bride of
[1:30:08] jesus christ that has been baptized and
[1:30:11] filled with the holy ghost is an under
[1:30:13] the token of the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:15] oh and we live so far below our
[1:30:17] privileges we allow the devil to push us
[1:30:19] this way and that way you ought to just
[1:30:21] stand upon the token upon the word of
[1:30:23] the hour and say i claim my mommy i
[1:30:25] claim my daddy i claim my brother i
[1:30:28] claim my sister i claim their household
[1:30:30] i claim it all on why because you've
[1:30:32] given me a true token you've given me
[1:30:34] the holy ghost and i've received a word
[1:30:36] in this hour that i'm standing on that
[1:30:38] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:30:39] your word will never pass away
[1:30:42] and she gathered them all in there on
[1:30:44] that jericho law
[1:30:46] and the scriptures would read like this
[1:30:48] joshua chapter 2
[1:30:51] say now therefore i pray
[1:30:55] swear unto me since i have showed you
[1:30:56] kindness that you will also show
[1:30:58] kindness under my father's house and
[1:30:59] give me a true token
[1:31:01] that you will save a life of my father
[1:31:03] and my mother and my brethren and my
[1:31:04] sister and all that they have and
[1:31:07] deliver our lives from death
[1:31:09] oh
[1:31:10] faith
[1:31:13] faith
[1:31:14] faith is your victory
[1:31:17] if you can see it in the word of god
[1:31:20] and have faith in the word of god you
[1:31:22] can have what you ask for
[1:31:26] there you go you can see it right you've
[1:31:27] been wanting to believe for your family
[1:31:28] you've been worried about your family
[1:31:30] you've been wondering all this time and
[1:31:32] the devil's been having you in a nervous
[1:31:33] wreck why don't you just go allow faith
[1:31:36] to rest in the word of god
[1:31:38] it's right there it's there it's playing
[1:31:40] just go ahead and anchor it and believe
[1:31:43] in it and trust in it and watch the word
[1:31:46] work exploits in your life
[1:31:48] and so now joshua comes there and it
[1:31:50] says in joshua chapter 6 verse 16
[1:31:55] 8 more minutes
[1:31:59] i mean i might be 15 but we will be
[1:32:01] eight
[1:32:02] now there the air in joshua six it says
[1:32:04] and it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:32:07] so now they've
[1:32:08] they've marched around jericho on the
[1:32:10] seventh day they marched seven more
[1:32:12] times
[1:32:14] and when the priest blew the trumpets
[1:32:18] joshua said unto the people
[1:32:23] shout
[1:32:24] for the lord hath given you the city
[1:32:27] and the city shall be accursed even in
[1:32:30] and all that are therein to the lord
[1:32:33] only rahab the harlot shall live
[1:32:35] she and all that are with her in the
[1:32:37] house because she hid the messengers
[1:32:40] that was sent
[1:32:42] you think it was by chance that rahab
[1:32:45] encountered those spies
[1:32:47] you think it's by chance that you
[1:32:49] encountered the message
[1:32:50] you think it's by chance that god has
[1:32:52] kept you alive when you should have been
[1:32:54] dead how many times
[1:32:57] you think it's by chance you're sitting
[1:32:59] here tonight
[1:33:01] oh it's not by chance it wasn't by
[1:33:04] chance rahab was in the mind of god i
[1:33:07] could just imagine they're in heaven
[1:33:09] god was watching the planet like oh
[1:33:11] watch this
[1:33:12] they're getting close to jericho maybe
[1:33:14] all the angels were sitting around like

[1:33:40] there watch she received the messengers
[1:33:42] now watch this okay here comes the shout
[1:33:44] and there with the shout
[1:33:46] the people shouted and what happened
[1:33:49] that shout was judgment and destruction
[1:33:51] to the whole city of jericho
[1:33:54] and the walls came tumbling down
[1:33:57] oh and everybody was destroyed but there
[1:33:59] was a group of people that were up there
[1:34:02] on the wall under the token message that

[1:35:15] salmon take me back i want to i want to
[1:35:18] do all those exploits they did in the
[1:35:19] other ages
[1:35:22] god had his own exploits
[1:35:24] he had something special for rahab there
[1:35:28] was a purpose that god wanted rahab to
[1:35:31] serve that was why he called her that's
[1:35:33] why he elected her that's why he chose
[1:35:35] her that god was going to grab a hold of
[1:35:38] her and he was going to manifest his
[1:35:40] very thoughts through rahab's life and
[1:35:42] if reyab would have kept looking off
[1:35:44] this way and kept looking off that way
[1:35:46] and turn around and look into the past
[1:35:48] ages and say well i want to go back
[1:35:49] there and i want to see those mighty
[1:35:51] works i want to see the red sea i want
[1:35:53] to see the rock i want to see all these

[1:35:57] was right there saying rahab
[1:35:59] do you realize who you are
[1:36:03] rahab
[1:36:04] do you realize who you are and rahab

[1:42:23] [Music]

[1:42:33] [Music]
[1:43:00] hey
[1:43:02] [Music]
[1:43:14] is
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:29] you know i can't
[1:43:32] have a better birthday present than
[1:43:35] have my son preach the unadulterated
[1:43:38] gospel
[1:43:40] but there's something else i'd like to
[1:43:42] do i'd like brother
[1:43:44] daniel hawks to come i'm going to pray
[1:43:46] for him
[1:43:47] i went to his work today and
[1:43:52] and he was
[1:43:54] wearing a necklace
[1:43:58] and i looked at him and said you look
[1:44:00] like a
[1:44:04] i mean he did he looked like a girl to
[1:44:06] me wearing a necklace he said brother he
[1:44:08] said
[1:44:10] this is
[1:44:11] alabaster some stone or something you
[1:44:14] know
[1:44:14] and he said it helps my shoulder
[1:44:17] you know
[1:44:18] and you know and
[1:44:21] i never thought nothing out you know
[1:44:24] and he'd come back out and he didn't
[1:44:25] have that necklace on
[1:44:29] so i believe that because he took that
[1:44:32] necklace off
[1:44:34] i told him i'd pray for that shoulder
[1:44:38] now either i was wrong
[1:44:40] and saying that necklace made him look
[1:44:42] like a which it did i didn't use
[1:44:44] the word
[1:44:45] i used
[1:44:47] another word that
[1:44:50] starts with an h
[1:44:52] and
[1:44:54] so anyway i believe god's word and then
[1:44:57] matthew's gospel
[1:44:59] the third poll
[1:45:01] brother brown spoke the squirrel
[1:45:04] right
[1:45:05] and he spoke the storm and
[1:45:07] all the floor but at the same time he
[1:45:09] was speaking a bride into existence
[1:45:13] amen i believe that so i'm going to pray
[1:45:16] for daniel and his shoulders going to
[1:45:18] get well
[1:45:20] because god's not going to have them
[1:45:22] walking around looking like a
[1:45:24] what's your thing
[1:45:27] and if you have any need prayer i would
[1:45:29] be happy to pray for you also
[1:45:32] but brother daniel come here i can't
[1:45:35] i know the only reason that
[1:45:38] you had that on is because
[1:45:40] that pain drove you to that
[1:45:43] we're gonna drive that thing
[1:45:52] amen watch daniel come a long way
[1:46:07] into drugs
[1:46:09] i'd meet him in his workplace and talk
[1:46:11] to him
[1:46:12] i've seen all kinds of
[1:46:18] things amen
[1:46:38] that god's calling you to get prayed for
[1:46:41] don't be ashamed
[1:46:44] amen our gracious heavenly father
[1:46:48] lord i spoke harsh words
[1:46:52] to your son
[1:47:02] he spoke to and said it's not right to
[1:47:04] give god's meat to dogs
[1:47:10] and she said that the dogs eat the drugs
[1:47:12] from the table
[1:47:15] lord i
[1:47:16] called
[1:47:17] daniel
[1:47:18] worse
[1:47:33] there's no way that you can turn
[1:47:46] and he did it from the depths of his
[1:47:48] heart
[1:48:01] that this exploit was manifested in
[1:48:04] daniel's life yes
[1:48:06] by choosing the word
