[22:50] oh
[22:55] [Music]
[23:06] this is a really old song um
[23:09] i think i first heard it when i was in
[23:11] high school
[23:12] and
[23:13] thinking about what brother
[23:15] billy was preaching the other day you
[23:17] know when you sing a song it
[23:20] needs to be real to you and i remember
[23:22] singing this song
[23:24] i don't know
[23:25] 20 years ago
[23:27] um
[23:28] and
[23:29] it wasn't the same
[23:32] and recently
[23:33] i was just thinking
[23:35] you know over the years on everything
[23:36] that he's done for us and
[23:39] this song came on my heart and i was you
[23:41] know i could just remember
[23:43] the words and i thought wow
[23:45] that's a whole different song
[23:47] now that i've been married and have
[23:49] children and you go through the
[23:51] struggles of life
[23:53] but anyhow it's been on my heart and i
[23:55] just pray that it'll be a blessing
[23:57] and if you know it feel free to sing it
[23:59] with me
[24:02] [Music]
[24:15] when i first began
[24:19] to walk with the lord
[24:23] i didn't
[24:24] fully
[24:26] trust him
[24:30] how he longed for me
[24:34] to
[24:35] understand
[24:39] that i could
[24:41] [Music]
[24:46] so through the valley
[24:51] he let me
[24:55] operate
[24:57] as i
[24:58] could be
[25:01] until i felt his loving arms
[25:06] [Music]
[25:10] embracing me
[25:17] see i've been through enough to know
[25:22] he'll be enough
[25:25] for me

[25:36] that puts my mind
[25:47] and i'll stake my very life that he's
[25:53] gonna take care
[25:54] of me
[25:59] [Music]
[26:01] you see i've been through enough to know
[26:06] he'll be enough for
[26:10] me
[26:15] how
[26:16] could i ever doubt my god
[26:22] whose hands hold the universe
[26:30] and how could i ever
[26:35] question his
[26:38] ability
[26:44] there's no place that i
[26:48] can go
[26:50] where he doesn't know
[26:54] the things that trouble
[26:58] me
[26:59] he's always aware
[27:03] of where
[27:12] i believe him now
[27:16] after all these years he's been so
[27:20] faithful he's proven to be true
[27:27] nevermore will i
[27:30] doubt our question why because i've seen
[27:36] him work before
[27:38] and i know what my god can do
[27:48] i've been through enough to know
[27:53] he'll be enough
[27:56] for me
[28:00] [Music]
[28:03] he's come through too many times and
[28:07] that puts my mind at ease
[28:15] [Music]
[28:22] that he's gonna take care of me
[28:31] you see i've been through enough to know
[28:37] you'll be enough
[28:39] for
[28:42] me i've been through enough to know
[28:48] he'll be enough
[28:51] for
[28:53] me

[32:17] let's turn over into the book of matthew
[32:21] the
[32:22] 15th chapter of matthew
[32:26] and 21st
[32:30] verse
[32:48] and we'll start
[32:49] reading there
[32:51] in the matthew the 15th chapter
[32:54] and the 21st verse
[32:57] then jesus went hence
[32:59] and departed unto the coast to torah and
[33:02] siddhan
[33:04] and behold a woman of cana came out
[33:08] of the same coast
[33:10] and cried unto him saying
[33:13] have mercy on me o lord
[33:16] thou son of david
[33:18] my daughter is grievously vexed with
[33:22] a devil but jesus answered her not a
[33:26] word
[33:27] and his disciples came and besought him
[33:31] saying
[33:32] send her away
[33:34] for she
[33:35] crieth after
[33:36] us but he answered and
[33:40] said i am not sent
[33:43] but unto the lost sheep
[33:45] of the house of israel
[33:47] then came she and worshipped him saying
[33:51] lord help me
[33:53] but he answered and said it is not meant
[33:57] to take the children's bread
[34:01] and cast it
[34:02] to dogs
[34:04] and she said true lord
[34:06] yay the dogs eat the crumbs which fall
[34:11] from the master's table
[34:13] then jesus answered and said unto her o
[34:17] woman great is thy faith
[34:19] be it unto thee even as doubt will
[34:23] and her daughter was made whole
[34:26] from that very
[34:29] hour
[34:30] amen amen
[34:32] god bless you may be seated we're going
[34:34] to listen just a few minutes this
[34:36] evening
[34:37] of that portion of kate where brother
[34:40] van talks about her her attitude and
[34:43] this and the approach
[34:45] that she had
[34:46] and that great persistent attribute that
[34:49] she had to get what she was
[34:52] uh
[34:53] longing for and i just think you'll
[34:55] enjoy this 28 minutes god bless you as

[35:02] oh brother sister how the church of the
[35:05] living god or to stand and i persistent
[35:10] as long as we can feel the covet of the
[35:12] holy spirit the blood of jesus christ
[35:14] cleansing us from all sin
[35:17] we should never let nothing stand in our
[35:19] way
[35:20] persistent
[35:22] certainly
[35:25] john
[35:27] the great prophet
[35:30] that was spoke out to raise up
[35:32] when he was in the wilderness
[35:34] he was told by god there's looking for a
[35:37] messiah of course
[35:39] 400 years before that had a prophet
[35:42] but god told him in the wilderness he
[35:44] said now they'll try to tell you
[35:46] uh doctor so and so is the guy or to be
[35:48] the messiah if you're to announce him
[35:50] why he's the best person in our
[35:51] congregation
[35:53] and they're going to say well the the
[35:54] high priestess grandson up here he's a
[35:57] he's the guy should have it and so forth
[35:59] but look john
[36:01] this is a real job
[36:05] you've got to be sure so i'm going to
[36:07] give you a sign upon whom thou shall see
[36:09] the spirit
[36:10] descending and remaining upon that'll be
[36:13] the one that'll baptize with the holy
[36:14] ghost and fire
[36:17] john stood there
[36:18] watched over the congregations as they
[36:21] come
[36:22] and he
[36:23] everybody coming this that the other but
[36:24] he couldn't see one day while standing
[36:27] debating with the priest
[36:28] saying you mean to tell me the time will
[36:30] come and the daily sacrifice will be
[36:32] taken away he said there have come a man
[36:35] and he looked
[36:37] there it was
[36:38] he said behold there is the lamb of god
[36:41] that takes away the sin of the world
[36:45] he knew it
[36:47] because god had told him upon whom now
[36:49] shall see the spirit descending he knew
[36:51] it
[36:52] he was persistent
[36:55] back to this little woman
[36:58] we just got many things we could say
[36:59] about different ones that was
[37:01] perseverant persistent
[37:04] holding on to achieve
[37:07] i've got a little slogan
[37:09] that i say it quite a bit
[37:11] it might be good for you to take it
[37:15] a winner
[37:16] never quits
[37:17] and a quitter never wins
[37:21] just think of it
[37:22] a winner
[37:24] never quits
[37:26] and a quitter can't win
[37:29] you must hold on
[37:31] and before you even start be dead sure
[37:34] you're right and then be persistent let
[37:37] nothing move you
[37:38] go on
[37:40] i've had quite a bit of experience of
[37:42] that and you know it
[37:44] i know this one thing when you're dead
[37:46] sure that you're in the will of god when
[37:48] you're dead sure
[37:50] you're centered in calvary nothing's
[37:52] going to move you
[37:54] you're there
[37:56] this little woman
[37:58] she was a greek
[38:00] and
[38:01] a serpeo
[38:03] and she had heard about the fame of
[38:06] jesus
[38:08] how does faith come
[38:09] by hearing
[38:11] hearing of the word she had heard of him
[38:14] and
[38:16] you know
[38:17] she might have had a lot of things to
[38:19] hinder
[38:20] for her being a greek
[38:22] faith cometh by hearing we know that
[38:25] and she had a a lot of things to hinder
[38:27] her
[38:28] but faith finds a source
[38:33] no other knows anything about
[38:35] faith finds this source
[38:38] that no one can explain it
[38:40] it's something that you know
[38:43] others can't see it but faith sees it
[38:47] faith sees that where the natural eye
[38:49] doesn't see it but the inside eye sees
[38:52] that thing
[38:53] now she had a need of jesus
[38:56] she first thing you have to do if you're
[38:58] going to find christ you've got to know
[39:00] that you've got a need of him when you
[39:02] think that you just don't need him then
[39:05] you'll never find him because you won't
[39:07] search him diligently
[39:11] did you notice that scripture where it
[39:13] says seek and you shall find
[39:16] knock and it'll be open
[39:18] actually that's just not knock like
[39:20] and it'll be open
[39:22] s e that's not just say well i went out
[39:25] lord here i am you want me no that's not
[39:28] it he that seeketh
[39:31] he that knocketh
[39:33] continuation
[39:35] it has to compare with the rest of
[39:37] scripture like the unjust judge and the
[39:39] widow
[39:41] constantly knocked on his door
[39:44] she was persistent
[39:46] if he turned her away today to marshes
[39:48] on his hands again
[39:50] that's the way you want to get god
[39:52] be on his hands every morning every
[39:54] night every day all the time constantly
[39:57] just keep seeking keep asking keep
[39:58] knocking
[40:00] just don't knock a little while get
[40:01] tired and go away just keep standing
[40:03] there
[40:04] god i'm here and i'm not going to leave
[40:08] i'm on your hands now
[40:10] i'm going to stay right here getting
[40:12] tired listen i'm having a great time
[40:14] knocking going on oh you're coming
[40:18] that's when something happens
[40:20] yes get you off of his hands
[40:23] so he comes out
[40:26] to answer you
[40:28] now
[40:29] faith finds this
[40:30] his word is a
[40:32] sword the bible says in hebrews 4 12
[40:35] that the word of god sharper than a
[40:37] two-eighth sword now there's only one
[40:39] thing can hold this sword that's the
[40:40] hand of faith
[40:42] the hand of faith is the only thing that
[40:44] can yield this sword of faith uh sword
[40:47] of the word
[40:48] now you might have a weak arm just
[40:51] enough to pick it up for justification
[40:53] you're so weak maybe that's all you can
[40:55] cut through
[40:57] but this sword of the wire
[41:00] will cut free every promise that god
[41:02] made in it if they got a good strong arm
[41:05] of faith holding it there
[41:07] i believe god for my healing i believe
[41:11] god for my baptism god made the promise
[41:14] and faith holds his sword it'll cut her
[41:16] out of the rock on earth
[41:18] every promise of god can be cut free
[41:21] by the word of god for it is a sword
[41:25] she had many hindrances but her faith
[41:27] didn't have any
[41:29] you might have a lot of hindrances every
[41:31] person starts out to meet christ we're
[41:33] fine you got a lot of hindrances but
[41:34] your faith don't have any
[41:36] faith don't have no hinders
[41:39] faith has hairs on his chest
[41:42] great big muscles
[41:45] reasons raised up and said you know
[41:46] what's reasonable faith pulls his
[41:48] muscles back sticks out his big chest
[41:50] and said shut up sit down
[41:54] and reason jumps over the corner takes
[41:55] his stew
[41:57] run
[41:58] faith's got muscles
[42:02] and he he means what he says
[42:06] that's what we need tonight
[42:08] that's what the four square church needs
[42:11] that's what the pentecostal group needs
[42:14] that's what the whole world needs
[42:16] that's what i need that's what you need
[42:19] and we want to be ashamed to admit it
[42:22] but we need a faith that'll hold god's
[42:24] word and say it's true
[42:28] meet the devil say thus saith the lord
[42:33] i was reading they were a man
[42:36] said the devil got before him and
[42:40] said he's just a little bitty old evil
[42:42] and he said boo said i jumped back
[42:46] and said he said boo i jumped back every
[42:48] time he'd haul her boo and i'd jump back
[42:50] he'd get bigger and i'd get littler
[42:52] instead he kept saying boo said i'd get
[42:54] smaller each time i want to jump back
[42:56] and he'd get bigger said i know they had
[42:58] to fight him after a while
[42:59] said i looked around but what i found
[43:01] the word of god
[43:03] said i wrote it in my hand and the devil
[43:05] said boo and i said boo back
[43:08] and said when i said boo back every time
[43:10] i said boo he got smaller and i got
[43:11] bigger
[43:12] that's it you've got to fight him sooner
[43:15] or later
[43:17] you know the people don't believe is the
[43:18] devil i run into him all the time
[43:23] head into him every day
[43:24] any other believer does
[43:28] yes
[43:29] you got to fight him sooner or later so
[43:30] he might as well start right now he's
[43:32] only one thing he's afraid of is that
[43:33] blood in that word
[43:36] faith holds it it's strong marches on
[43:40] now
[43:41] find out this little
[43:43] greek woman
[43:44] as i said she had many hindrances but
[43:46] her faith didn't have any
[43:48] faith don't have any henderson
[43:51] they might have said to her
[43:53] you know you're a greek
[43:56] you're
[43:57] you're a greek
[43:59] uh you know you don't belong to his
[44:00] denomination
[44:03] don't go down there that bunch
[44:06] now that's one of the hindrances
[44:08] see but if you've got faith you're going
[44:10] anyhow
[44:11] i don't make any what denominations he's
[44:14] in
[44:15] just so he's there
[44:17] she had a need she had a daughter that
[44:19] was dying with epilepsy
[44:21] and she had to get to him because the
[44:22] doctors couldn't do nothing for her
[44:25] can't do it yet
[44:26] so she had to get to jesus she'd hurt it
[44:28] he'd heal those kind of cases
[44:30] well they said
[44:32] he's not he's not he never come with his
[44:34] revival to your denominations
[44:36] that didn't hinder
[44:37] that little woman had faith
[44:40] she was persistent she just passed that
[44:42] group
[44:43] her faith pulled her away from it
[44:46] oh if he could just do that today
[44:49] somebody says in the meeting right down
[44:50] to four square church
[44:52] well it don't belong to your
[44:53] denomination you better stay away from
[44:55] down there just press right on through
[44:56] your faith takes your enemy
[44:58] see faith has no hindrance it goes
[45:00] anyhow nothing's going to stop it
[45:03] like i said it's brawny
[45:05] big muscles it's got the floor
[45:08] the rest of them scared of it
[45:10] yes sir they'll run from it like
[45:12] smallpox they just get plumb away
[45:14] they ain't got nothing to do with that
[45:15] but big faith raises up say i know who i
[45:18] believe
[45:19] i'm persuaded
[45:21] that's it
[45:23] you know i've been another group that
[45:24] come along
[45:25] say the days of miracles has passed
[45:28] there is no such a thing as that that's
[45:30] a bunch of holy rollers now i am jews
[45:32] we are greece we're smart we're
[45:34] intelligent group of people
[45:35] we give the world art music
[45:38] and religion
[45:39] and there's no such a thing as that but
[45:41] she was persistent
[45:43] days of miracles wasn't passed for her
[45:45] because something done totally down here
[45:47] that it wasn't
[45:49] and if jesus had what she was looking
[45:51] for and she was determined to get to him
[45:53] regardless of her denomination sponsored
[45:55] it or not
[45:56] she's going anyhow she's going to get
[45:58] down there she was persistent still
[46:01] persistent days and miracles might be
[46:03] passed for them but it wasn't for her
[46:06] that's what it is with every believer
[46:08] then people say the days of miracles a
[46:09] man told me some time ago said i don't
[46:12] care what you'd say mr branham but i
[46:14] don't believe there is such a thing as
[46:15] divine healing i said certainly not to
[46:17] you
[46:18] it wasn't for unbelievers just for those
[46:20] who believe
[46:21] that's right it wasn't sent to
[46:23] unbelievers it was sent to believers you
[46:25] can't enjoy it because you know nothing
[46:27] about it
[46:28] he won't tell me there was no such thing
[46:29] as the holy ghost i said you're just
[46:31] about 33 years too late for that
[46:34] i said i know better
[46:37] i've done received it ah nonsense as it
[46:39] might be to you but not to me
[46:42] it's real to me it's life
[46:48] something anchored you come too late to
[46:50] tell me that
[46:51] they've come too late tell us about
[46:52] divine healing we'd have been healed
[46:54] we've not been filled with the holy
[46:56] ghost we done got raptured in grace amen
[46:59] it's too late for any of those things he
[47:01] might as well shut up we done got it
[47:03] our faith can say sound i know what i'm
[47:05] talking about
[47:07] well doctors i don't care what doctor
[47:09] so-and-so said the bible said it and
[47:11] i've got faith in that book in my hand
[47:13] and my faith holds it out there jesus is
[47:16] coming
[47:17] i believe that i receive the holy ghost
[47:19] because i see him living in my life
[47:21] hey man it's according to the word
[47:23] nothing unmanifested
[47:26] revelation
[47:27] a perfect vindication of the bible being
[47:30] right jesus christ the same yesterday
[47:32] then forever let them laugh that away
[47:34] they could laugh all they want to we'll
[47:36] just be as persistent as it was when
[47:38] noah was
[47:39] moses was all the rest of the
[47:41] impersonators raising up james and
[47:43] champions threw their rod down turned
[47:45] into a snake there was those men just as
[47:47] honorable as they could be did exactly
[47:49] what god told them doing there come a
[47:50] bunch of impersonation up throw down
[47:52] their rods the only thing they could do
[47:54] is just stand still and see the glory of
[47:55] god amen
[47:58] god will stand by it if he's sensing
[48:00] you're sure of it
[48:02] you're going to achieve the work that
[48:04] god
[48:05] predestinated for you to do you'll stand
[48:07] there and god will take every carnal
[48:09] impersonator away from it right
[48:12] stand there
[48:13] you can be persistent because you know
[48:16] who you have believed and what's right
[48:18] examine your revelation with the word if
[48:20] it's contrary to the word leave it alone
[48:22] if it's with the word god's bound duty
[48:24] bound to keep his word
[48:26] now
[48:28] now there might have been a bunch of
[48:29] ladies stand down the corner
[48:31] uh you know
[48:32] and they said here she comes
[48:34] now she's got that kid up here it's got
[48:36] epilepsy in and dr so and so said that
[48:39] that there's no cure for epilepsy and
[48:41] here she is going down to that off-brand
[48:44] denomination down there
[48:46] for that fanatic prophet to come up here
[48:48] and heal that child
[48:50] so they said we are to stop susie i hope
[48:53] there's not a susie here but we are to
[48:55] stop susie and tell her because she's
[48:58] been a good woman there's nothing
[48:59] against her life but we are to stop her
[49:02] and the only thing i don't do she's
[49:03] passed by everybody else so she won't
[49:06] break this barrier you know what susie
[49:08] your husband will leave you
[49:11] because he's the trustee or deacon of
[49:13] the lord
[49:14] and he'll leave you sure as the world if
[49:16] you go down there she was still
[49:17] persistent
[49:19] she went right on see faith don't know
[49:21] no hindrance
[49:23] it must get there
[49:25] then she passed another group and said
[49:26] you know what when you return back
[49:28] defeated and find out there's nothing to
[49:31] it everybody in the neighborhood will
[49:33] laugh at you that didn't even make her
[49:35] ears turn red she was persistent she
[49:37] went right on i like that i like that
[49:40] persistence
[49:43] then he urged one of the deacons and
[49:45] said if you go down there you know what
[49:47] they're going to do put you out of your
[49:48] church
[49:49] because you've associated yourself with
[49:51] them holy or the people i said you know
[49:54] excuse me
[49:56] oh maybe i said it you associate
[49:58] yourself with them you'll get put out
[49:59] your church she was still persistent
[50:02] faith knows no defeat
[50:04] she had one thing to achieve and that
[50:06] was get to jesus
[50:08] she had a need
[50:09] and he was the only one who had that
[50:11] need i'm seeing this tonight brother and
[50:13] sister
[50:14] i'm 53 years old i've been serving him
[50:17] since about 20. he's met everything that
[50:19] i had to need
[50:21] and when it comes to the hour of my
[50:22] death i'm sure what i need right then
[50:24] two wings to reach across the river
[50:26] he'll be there don't you worry
[50:29] i know he'll be there i'll just stick
[50:31] the old sword back in the sheath and
[50:33] take off the helmet lay it down up on
[50:34] the river when i bank when i hear the
[50:37] dashers and i'll scream send out the
[50:39] lifeboat i'm coming home this morning
[50:40] it'll be there
[50:41] yes sir the morning star will come down
[50:44] and light up the way across the river
[50:46] we'll go yes sir
[50:48] amen
[50:51] she was persistent
[50:53] she had an achievement
[50:54] she knew that she had to be persevered
[50:56] in order to get to jesus so she had to
[50:59] pass by everything finally she arrived
[51:03] now
[51:04] finally got here everything's fine now
[51:08] and then here come another hindrance
[51:11] the very man that she'd profess to have
[51:13] confidence in
[51:15] the man she tried to get to jesus he
[51:17] said i'm not sent to your race
[51:22] would that have not made us pentecostal
[51:24] blow up
[51:29] i'm not sent to your race
[51:33] that was a shock but you know what
[51:35] he
[51:36] knows no shock
[51:40] and then again he turns around after all
[51:43] these things should pass through and her
[51:45] faith holding that she knew that jesus
[51:48] could give her her desire and she went
[51:50] through every one of these barriers and
[51:51] when she got to him and turned down flat
[51:55] i'm not even sent to your race
[51:59] i can imagine standing in her eyes
[52:00] gleaming she was in front of me man
[52:03] that's all she had to be
[52:05] and said besides that
[52:07] you're a race ain't nothing but a bunch
[52:08] of dogs oh my
[52:12] what if it said that to you
[52:14] you said i'll take my papers from this
[52:16] four square and go over to somewhere
[52:18] else
[52:20] i'll never go back there again i'll take
[52:22] it from so and so oh yes yes sir
[52:26] but still she held on
[52:29] oh see faith knows no defeat ain't
[52:32] nothing going to stop it
[52:34] though jesus said to her the very one
[52:36] she come to
[52:38] said i'm not sent to your race and
[52:40] they're nothing but a bunch of dogs
[52:43] but what she had a hold of real faith
[52:47] faith knows no defeat i don't care where
[52:49] it comes from
[52:50] knows no defeat because she had faith
[52:53] still she held on oh i love that
[52:56] she was not a hotbed plant
[52:59] a hybrid like some of them today
[53:03] these high bred religions we got today
[53:05] you know
[53:06] ain't no good
[53:08] everything now is hybrid hybrid even
[53:10] they got hybrid churches
[53:12] hybrid christians
[53:14] talking by shaking their hands oh they
[53:16] can dress better and maybe use better
[53:18] english and so forth like that ain't got
[53:20] no life in it
[53:21] you take a big fine ear corn hybrid
[53:23] maybe it's twice as pretty as the other
[53:25] one plant it it'll die
[53:29] that's right
[53:31] we don't want nothing hybrid we want the
[53:33] genuine thing
[53:35] if you haven't got it stay there till it
[53:37] comes
[53:38] why except the substitute when the
[53:40] pentecostal skies are full of the reel
[53:43] nothing hybrid it won't stain you have
[53:45] to always spray a hybrid plant keep the
[53:47] bugs off of it
[53:50] that's where some of these hybrid
[53:51] christians you have to baby them and pet
[53:52] them and promise them they'll be deacon
[53:54] or something else keep some of the
[53:56] worldly bugs from them of unbelief
[53:59] then get out of the church kick them out
[54:00] anyhow
[54:02] never was in
[54:04] you can't join a church
[54:06] you might join a lodge
[54:09] you can join the methodist lodge baptist
[54:10] lodge or pentecostal lodge but if you
[54:12] ever come to christ you'll be born into
[54:14] the church
[54:16] that's right the mystical body of christ
[54:18] others are lodges that's right it's all
[54:21] right nothing against them but you're
[54:22] born into the church of the living god
[54:25] by the spirit of god you can't join it
[54:27] at all and when you're born in there you
[54:29] got a birth you're not a hybrid no more
[54:31] a hand joiner or a hitchhiker
[54:34] no hitchhiker's always thumbing that's
[54:36] way well i know but doctor so-and-so no
[54:38] no that's it
[54:40] that's it
[54:43] exactly she was persistent she wasn't a
[54:45] hybrid you had to spray her over with
[54:47] perfume
[54:48] make her right she stood there
[54:51] part of our crop today too many of
[54:53] them's hybrids just a couple like david
[54:55] duplis i believe once said god has no
[54:57] grandchildren
[54:59] troubled our pentecostal movement we're
[55:00] getting pentecostal grandchildren
[55:02] they come in because our fathers and
[55:04] mothers for pentecostal we take them in
[55:05] on the cradle roll and they come up
[55:07] without the experience and there they
[55:08] say they're a pentecostal too no sir
[55:11] god don't have grandchildren
[55:14] he ain't grandfather he's father
[55:16] right
[55:17] if you ever get to heaven you'll pay the
[55:19] price like your mother did your daddy
[55:21] did
[55:24] amen
[55:25] that might sound crude but it's true
[55:27] it's crude way of making a point but you
[55:29] understand that kind of english i'm sure
[55:31] it isn't very good english it gets the
[55:33] point what i'm trying to say you just
[55:34] listen to her
[55:35] yes
[55:37] she wasn't a hybrid she didn't have to
[55:38] be sprayed over and baby now well i
[55:40] sister dear i i i tell you no no no sir
[55:46] and no matter what knocked her down she
[55:47] said truth we're nothing but a bunch of
[55:49] dogs it's true that we're not worthy of
[55:51] it oh my she admitted that he was right
[55:55] i'm going to say a great big mouthful
[55:57] get ready
[55:59] every time genuine faith will admit the
[56:02] words right
[56:03] and anytime that if something says that
[56:05] the days of miracles has passed or
[56:07] something against the bible it's not
[56:08] genuine faith
[56:11] of faith will always admit truth
[56:14] must stay with the word
[56:17] no matter what anything else says what
[56:18] anybody else says it's the words right
[56:20] let every man's word be a lie and mind
[56:22] true every who will add to or take away
[56:24] from the same will be take this part out
[56:26] of the book of life
[56:28] god's going to judge the world by a
[56:30] church which one
[56:32] catholic 660 somehow different
[56:34] denominations how is he going to do that
[56:35] god's going to judge the world by jesus
[56:37] christ
[56:38] and christ in the beginning was the word
[56:40] the word is with god and the word was
[56:42] god and the word was made flesh and
[56:44] dwelt among us god and the word is the
[56:46] same
[56:47] this is god on print you've got the
[56:50] you've got the holy spirit plant that
[56:51] seed in there it brings it to life
[56:53] breaks that life forth and manifested
[56:55] and vindicated
[56:57] jesus said in saint john 12 he that

[59:47] gift of god
[59:49] she had the right approach humility she
[59:51] fell down at his feet
[59:53] and she had humility she didn't stop

[1:01:50] tell me that you heal the sick
[1:01:53] uh that chrome will be enough for me i
[1:01:56] believe it
[1:01:57] let me hear somebody say and read it
[1:02:00] from the word that
[1:02:01] the holy ghost peter said on the day of
[1:02:03] pentecost repent every one of you be
[1:02:06] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:02:08] the remission of your sins and you shall
[1:02:10] receive the gift of the holy ghost for
[1:02:12] the promise isn't to you
[1:02:14] and to your children and to them it's
[1:02:16] far off even as many as the lord are god
[1:02:20] shall call

[1:02:27] come
[1:02:28] are we ready to take the crumbs are we
[1:02:31] ready to humble ourselves she was
[1:02:34] she was ready to humble herself
[1:02:37] faith always admits the word right faith
[1:02:40] is always humble
[1:02:43] faith humbles itself
[1:02:45] now she was just looking for the crumbs
[1:02:48] watch what jesus said for this saying
[1:02:52] for this saying
[1:02:54] i'm willing to take the crumbs lord
[1:02:56] for this saying
[1:02:58] thy
[1:02:59] child is whole

[1:03:02] believe it

[1:03:04] admits that the word of god is right
[1:03:07] faith admits all these things
[1:03:12] amen did you enjoy that
[1:03:14] i i think there's a lot of
[1:03:17] a lot of
[1:03:19] right things in there for us that we can
[1:03:22] hold to and it certainly
[1:03:25] demonstrates the
[1:03:27] uh the attribute and the characteristic
[1:03:29] of a real believer
[1:03:32] amen it come from her heart
[1:03:35] she said she didn't know what it was but
[1:03:37] there was something down in there you
[1:03:39] know who put that down something down in
[1:03:41] there he did
[1:03:43] he did it for all of us let's open our
[1:03:45] bibles and stand as we prepare
[1:03:48] for communion
[1:03:50] turn to the 11th chapter of the
[1:03:54] first corinthians 11 chapter and the
[1:03:56] 23rd verse
[1:03:59] the brothers that are going to serve the
[1:04:01] communion if they would go
[1:04:03] prepare it and
[1:04:05] do you have that determination in your
[1:04:07] heart
[1:04:08] uh
[1:04:12] you you know
[1:04:15] i i like where how brother brahms says
[1:04:18] you
[1:04:20] put put yourself on god's hands
[1:04:23] make them deal with you make them do
[1:04:25] something
[1:04:26] you know and sometimes we don't think we
[1:04:28] can have that attitude towards god but
[1:04:31] yet that's the very same attitude he
[1:04:33] wants you to have
[1:04:34] you know
[1:04:35] like he said the unjust judge
[1:04:38] he made those type you just keep
[1:04:40] knocking
[1:04:41] if you don't answer you should be there
[1:04:43] the next day god i'm here god i'm here i
[1:04:46] want this i need this i got to have this
[1:04:49] and you just keep pressing press and
[1:04:51] press and pressing and don't stop
[1:04:53] i like that don't you
[1:04:55] amen it gives me hope
[1:04:57] i have no strength if he don't answer
[1:05:00] i have no victory if he don't answer
[1:05:03] lord you have to answer
[1:05:05] 23rd verse of the 11th chapter
[1:05:08] of the
[1:05:09] first
[1:05:11] gospel or epistle of paul to the
[1:05:13] corinthians
[1:05:17] first corinthians 11 23 for i have
[1:05:19] received of the lord that which also i
[1:05:23] delivered unto you
[1:05:24] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:05:27] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:05:29] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:05:32] said take eat
[1:05:33] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:05:37] this do in remembrance of me
[1:05:39] and after the same manner also he took
[1:05:42] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:05:44] cup is the new testament in my blood
[1:05:47] this duty as often actually drink it in
[1:05:50] remembrance of me for often as you eat
[1:05:53] this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:05:55] show the lord's death till he come
[1:05:58] wherefore who shall
[1:06:01] whosoever shall eat this bread or drink
[1:06:03] of this cup
[1:06:04] the lord unworthily shall be guilty of
[1:06:07] the body and blood of the lord but let a
[1:06:10] man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:06:12] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[1:06:15] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:06:17] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:06:20] not discerning the lord's body
[1:06:22] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:06:24] among you in many sleep
[1:06:26] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:06:28] should not be judged but when we are
[1:06:31] judged we are chastened of the lord that
[1:06:34] we should not be condemned with the
[1:06:36] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:06:38] come together to eat carry one for
[1:06:41] another and if any man hunger let them
[1:06:43] eat at home that ye come not together
[1:06:46] unto condemnation and the rest will i
[1:06:49] set an order when i come
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:54] amen do you love the lord
[1:06:56] tonight let's just pray as the brothers
[1:06:59] bring the bread
[1:07:00] and the wine and we'll ask you to bless
[1:07:02] it
[1:07:07] let us pray together
[1:07:09] you have a special need on your heart
[1:07:11] just something before the lord
[1:07:14] that you want to
[1:07:17] maybe you have a weakness in your life
[1:07:20] that
[1:07:20] is
[1:07:21] a sin that so easily besets you and
[1:07:24] you're
[1:07:25] just battling so against it you just

[1:08:02] lord as we
[1:08:04] look upon this bread that you broke
[1:08:09] or
[1:08:10] in remembrance of the
[1:08:12] sacrifice that you made for us at
[1:08:15] calvary
[1:08:17] that your
[1:08:18] word is made indeed
[1:08:21] and lord it is life and we can live by
[1:08:25] the life of your word in every
[1:08:26] circumstance your word can control
[1:08:29] the circumstance
