Description:
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service: June 7,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

a baby dedication this morning brother George's and then Corvettes are going to dedicate their daughter Sharon Rose I'm going to try to say this right Maibaum boy I don't think I pronounced it just

turn around this way so Vegas darling hallelujah amen amen we don't baptize babies we dedicate them and then when the Lord Jesus comes down in life somewhere in their path and he begins to deal with their heart and then that's when they're called to repentance and then when they come to repentance then they're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's a choice that she makes so we're gonna dedicate her to the Lord and ask her to guide her and keep her and bring her to that place that she surrenders her life to him and and and that's what we believe and by faith that work on a razor in the way that she should go so that when the time comes she'll return to that way and they say amen so brother George would you say a prayer for your daughter and every father knew Jesus we thank you for this moment such blessing too brought to you my daughter thank you Lord to added one more in the family and we bring back her life to you bless your life Lord let your peace and your power gather her life in Jesus Christ and pray amen I remember when George was just a single fella running around and now look at this beautiful family God's given them a we just don't dedicate babies we did a Cape families do a gracious Heavenly Father Lord God is we stand here with this beautiful family Lord in this little child Sharon rose and this families come and Lord they're presenting her to you and they're asking that you camp your angels around her that you keep her and guide her that you raise her up in your ways in your statutes in your spirit nor that the seed that you planted within her heart before the foundation of the world that you'll water it and increase it and bless it and father may she come to that place in her life where she surrenders her heart 100% to you father and you fill her with your Holy Spirit we ask that you would grant that to this wonderful child to this beautiful family Lord as they walk in your word we ask that you bless them may they prosper and be in good health and we dedicate Sharon rose to you in the wonderful and precious and beautiful name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you brother god bless you sister I'll push you Betty hey man thank you musicians this morning you love the Lord this morning amen God certainly good to us and and we're sure traveling down a wonderful road it's the people are slowly be able to make their way back to church and in the people are starting to go out again and we're starting to realize that there's life and life to be led and and we certainly want to let the joy of our heart reign forth we certainly don't want to ever be bound by fear amen I certainly enjoyed a sister Sandra's testimony I was a personal witness to the great power and deliverance of the Holy Spirit so we're grateful for that you might understand a little bit why I try to pace myself and I speak a little slower and you can understand that we have interpretation going on in three different languages this morning Spanish and and French and Swahili so I think it's wonderful and some of those languages take a lot more words than the words that we is and and also I'm not a very easy person to interpret because in order to interpret you have to have the thought of what is being said and I kind of speak in a manner that you don't know where I'm going and then I I tell you what I meant what I said so I know it's hard but there's really something burning in my heart and I don't know always how to express it but what happens is as I the things just comes on my heart and I've always been the type of person anybody that's really known me they know that I'm I'm prone to be a workaholic I'm prone to be overboard I guess and maybe fanatical in everything that I undertake you know I used to deep-sea fish and so it wasn't just good enough to go out and deep-sea fish for an afternoon or a day you know I would take 10-day trips way out in the middle of the ocean you know what I mean and I just didn't have one fishing rod or two fishing rods I had a fishing rod for every kind of fish every size of fish morning rod afternoon rod the evening rod and and I like to put everything I've got into something I don't like to do things halfway sometimes you're challenged where you can't do things the way that you want to and you realize that you need the help of other people to to go forward and so I shared with you a little bit I believe it was Sunday evening of the path that I feel in my heart nothing it's the only path and I'm not saying it's the path that you have to take I'm just saying in my heart I get just something that's burning in my heart that I feel that the church needs to take into deep consideration and I was listening and I came across this sermon it's called why Christ beat now there's two messages called why Christ beat one is in 1963 and we're gonna read some portions of that this morning this morning's going to be a Bible study we're not going to try to be too long but maybe it'll be a little longer this morning but I hope that you can take it in your heart but I'd like to play for you a portion of a sermon of called why Christ be preached in 1959 and the both of the sermons are very parallel and they're dealing with the same subject matter in a lot of ways but you can see from where brother random brought it up and how that it comes up and the progression of the church so I'd like to listen to this this morning and a lot of times in this message why Christ beat brother branham's referring to that because of the talking about Moses and what Moses went through but this morning when you listen to this I would like you to realize that Moses is a type of you and you say well Moses was a type of Christ yes he was a type of Christ and and so we see that that the the if Moses was a type of Christ and the things that transpired in Moses life reflected what was in Christ life well if we follow that same pattern down we know that what we saw in Christ's life in the lord jesus' life should be reflected in our life that that's what we we would be able to look at and see because our whole goal is is to become like he was that the works that i do you shall do all so our goal our purpose our heart is to be come and to enter into this union that that we have with the lord jesus christ and that that union might manifest in our lives that the that the truth of god's word might be reflected through us and so when you listen to this o berm and subtitles that the attitude towards god's anointed and buts since this morning were God's anointed and I like just my thought from this is not the anointing towards God's attitude toward God's anointing but the attitude towards our anointing in other words were God's anointed one what's the attitude that we have towards the anointing that God has placed upon us the calling that he's placed upon us the election that he has given us the the power that he is a poured upon us what is our attitude towards it and before I get caught up and start going let's just take them moment for 27 minutes that's not too long my personal belief you're gonna listen to 27 minutes of the greatest preacher that has ever walked since the days of the Lord and in the days of Paul and one that had the true Word of God and I just think it'll bless you this morning so if you would patiently listen and and and it just take these few moments and then I'll try not to be too long afterwards and then we'll just keep moving forward tonight is communion in foot-washing I just decided I don't have to preach the whole sermon and one morning so I'll preach it in little parts but so this let's listen this morning as we listen to what the prophet of God saying about a church that goes forward so if the brothers would play it and we'll just ask the Lord to richly bless you this morning so as we were going to start we can go ahead and and stand and if you want like to open your Bibles go ahead let's stand and we'll open our Bibles to Exodus the fourteenth chapter and and when brother Branham reads these words when he says may the Lord add his blessings to the reading of the word and then he'll say a prayer and at the end of his prayer just be seated lord richly bless you this morning that I hope that you have confidence in the Word of God this morning and that you're interested in knowing what God wants us to be God richly bless you this morning I wish to read now out of the book of Exodus the fourteenth chapter and the fifteenth verse and the Lord said unto Moses were for Christ island to me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward may I read the sixteenth also but lift up thy rod stretch out thine hand over the sea and divided and the children of Israel shall pass on dry ground through the midst of the sea may the Lord at his blessings to the reading of his word and now let us bow our heads just a moment for prayer and if there's any people share that would like to be remembered in this prayer may you let it be known to God by an uplifted hand the Lord grant to you your desire Lord we now solemnly and honorably and childlike walk on the sacred grounds of Prayer we lay aside every weight every sin every thought that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that set before us and as we move into these blessed sacred sands of Prayer knowing this that Jesus said ask the Father anything in my name I'll do it and again it is written if ye abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you then we come Lord not in the name of this little church or in the name of its pastor though we love them are not in our own name because we have nothing to offer through it but we come in that all sufficient name of the Lord Jesus who gave us a promise that if we asked in his name we could receive whatever we asked and we would not want to ask anything that was a myth we would want to ask only that which would be pleasing to you you know our conditions you know what we have need of you know what this little church has need of and what each individual has need ah we'd pray the Lord God to give to us save early as we have needs may the great holy spirit move down upon this building and around these people and sanctify this group that the Holy Spirit might have there right away through every heart here tonight from the least of the children to the oldest Granite Lord these hands that were lifted up you most surely seen them Lord if a spare cannot fall in the street without you knowing it how much more do you know when a child of yours lifts its hand towards heaven for bread we are promised that it will not receive a stone instead we know that you shall give them the bread that they asked for and we would ask to remember all that's sick and afflicted so glad to hear from brother Rogers that he said he felt well enough to go to work we are so glad for that Lord praying that you will heal him that that cancer will not have the the right away but will be stopped by the blood of the Lord Jesus by faith we place the blood of the Lord Jesus between the death cancer and our brother now we ask for all that's Nydia we're get glory to thyself honor thy word Lord as we have read it and give us a great healing service for the glory of God we asked it in the name of the Lord Jesus a man for our text tonight I would like to use three words why cry speak and for a subject I would like to use the attitude of people towards God's anointed just for a short time perhaps twenty minutes or thirty then we'll start the prayer line God had called Moses a special calling and when God calls the man and anoint him for a certain duty he expects that man to carry that out to the letter God doesn't want to give a man a commission in him hum Hall around about it he won't seem to go straight forward and do just exactly what he's commissioned to do don't look right or left just move forward and the children of Israel had been in bondage for some 400 years but God had promised that he would visit them and God keeps every promise that he makes he cannot lie he's God and the time had come for this visitation and I believe tonight paralleling that God made a promise that he would return again I believe that we are near that time this morning when I was speaking on that subject I could almost feel the current as the saying that the nearness of the Lord Jesus now Moses being called for this purpose but he was a man God training 80 years before he ever was able to use him 40 years in the palace and 40 years in the wilderness God can train a man taking a hundred years for 30 minutes worth God knows how to train what the schools have put in Moses 40 years had taken 40 years to get it out but one time in the presence of the anointing one time in the presence of the burning bush he'd know more about God than Hitler 10 bucks in the 80 years of his life God trains his man than anoints and gives an experience takes them to the Riggin training down to the sands of burning punishment trying testing not only does he do that to the profits but he does it to his children every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried tested by his world see when the pitch comes the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the Word of God say God said so that settles it and God it calls such a man and that man must Moses but Moses are greater like us every time it come a place to something had to be done Moses called out o Lord what must I do in this place now isn't that just like we do God had blessed him and anointed him above his brethren give him a message and a ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taking place Moses run off to God with it Lord what must I do what must I do in this case God got tired of it I believe said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward to retreat was in but God has no retreat there's no place to retreat in God go forward the doctor says his cancer go forward if he says his TV go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak while his word I can't go forward thus saith the Lord and move on crowd to the people but the people then rebelled and said it had been better that we died down in Egypt it'd have been better that we had our grave smart than from the hyenas and the vultures that picked our bones in this wilderness why did you bring us out here after that scene that God had approved Moses to be his servant God when God comes into a person or two persons into a congregation into a man or woman he of indicates his presence God proves that he's there while when God comes supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished frustrations their solid stable leave our dies Christ don't care what comes or what goes nothing shakes them they move forward and Moses Freddy with the people and other people threaded to Moses and he said what must we do and go farmer bicycle answer now they said we are out in this wilderness and the armies of Pharaoh is approaching us they're camped just behind us but Moses knew to obey God and if God sends a representative and he anoints this representative and sends it into the world the people must obey that representative it's always been that way all down through the Bible Moses is called for the job God has said in the word he would do it he promised that he would send such a thing in that day to deliver him and God did his part Saint Moses and the children of Israel just because little stumbles and things come along to try they failed to march with Moses I isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God trills every person in there the glory of God Falls around in signs and wonders take place less than a week Satan is permitted to come into that congregation why does he do it God permits it and then the church begins to murmur fall back maybe it wasn't so there's where we fail that's the failing of the church regardless of what takes place it's God move forward or say there's brother so-and-so I shouted the victory with him but he's back no matter what he done that has nothing to do with you well so-and-so professor said that that wasn't right that wasn't other the Lord no matter what professor said so you are the God who stood on the sacred grounds you're the guy was at the burning bush professors of Egypt what a pharaoh would have said to Moses oh you just imagined you seen a bush you thought you had a that's reward in your ears Moses do you want to talk to him and every man thus born of the Spirit of God knows what talks to him when the Holy Ghost comes it speaks a peace that passes understanding Moses was called he and God then edge of Moses receiving his call he went down to Egypt then he's got to get the people to believe him now he was the anointed prophet of the Lord but the people didn't believe him though he God proved it by signs and wonders that he did and because they didn't believe Moses the servant of the Lord then they fell in the wilderness and every one of them died that left Egypt not a one of them was saved everyone died and perished beside Joshua and Caleb that started out because they murmured and complained against the vindicated message that God has spoken the Bible oh when I think of that when God promises anything God keeps his word and when God confirms that word to you then believe it God promised in the last days he had pour out his spirit upon all flesh and your young men would see visions the old man would dream dreams if all my hands made some maidservant well I'll pour out of my spirit he's sure signs in the heavens and in the earth and great signs and wonders would take place in the last days and here we are in the last days and God's keeping his word the Holy Spirit's here and it indicates the coming of the Lord Jesus and the people turn it down and murmur against them just like it was that's our deliverance Moses was a signpost of the deliverance of Israel according to God's Word the time through 9 God sent Moses he was God's light for that day I am today the time is drawing nigh atomic bombs are ready the world's going to be blown to pieces pretty soon ashes all over the earth nothing Falk indication the time is at hand and God promised he'd pour out his spirit and take his church out and the Holy Ghost is here representing that with signs and wonders proving that he is the same Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost doing the same work that he did when he was your honor lines of people the gospel always blinds the people if they don't open their eyes you either walk or it blinds the people yes every case in the Bible when God sent a messenger and that messenger was received there was a revival in that time but if they was not received there was no revival but just chaos followed the unbelief so is it today nothing less I think today I like to make mention of one woman and I think of in the Bible and she was bad to begin with rotten to the core a young beautiful woman by the name of Rahab she was a heathen to start with and she was a prostitute on the street but she heard that there was a God not an idol that said to her her declaration of Crete but God who lived among his people and anointed them and signs and wonders was falling there she heard about it one day two representatives come to Jericho and quickly her on the street as a prostitute she called him took him into her house said they're after you and she hid them I have like her attitude she never said I'll believe when I see the great anointed Joshua do some sign if I could have seen Moses do some of the signs I would have believed but she said I have heard faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word I have heard that the God of heaven who is a real God is with you and he doesn't great signs and wonders he dried up the Red Sea he brought bags up on Egypt we see how you turned the enemy over to your hands and our whole country is trembling because of it I'm asking mercy she didn't say I'll have to see this God first let me take my judgement take my my scripture says about that and see she never found it but faith cometh by hearing hearing the Word of God and she believed and when these words was brought back to Joshua the word Joshua means Savior like Jesus that and it brought back to Joshua God's anointed her house was permitted to stand and when the people marched 13 times around the walls of Jericho and sounded the trumpet every place on that wall fell at her house because she believed before she seen anything she accepted it she said they're servants of the Most High God and I was receiving up on the basis of hearing it I believe it faith cometh by hearing she heard it she believed she accepted it I noticed they said buying this scarlet string that you led us down with find it in the window that reg spoke of the blood of Jesus their Tolman and every place in that wall fell but Rahab's house it said on top of the wall God honored her and he she saw as great a miracle performed there as he was drying up the red sea where the hand of Jehovah was over that little place to protect it she had accepted it God's anointed God's servants went over there anointed and she believed it before she's seen miracles she believed it anyhow and accepted it they larger the prophet of the Lord anointed oh yes God anointed him to be prophet he was pastor Elisha I don't imagine Jezebel would have wanted calling that but he was her pastor just the same God made her pastor so she hated him and God told him said you go up on the mountain and you sit down there I've commanded the crows to fiji i'll water you from the brook Sidra and he set down there and the king said go get that fanatic and bring him down here and the soldiers all armed with the command of the king they start up the hill and elijah probably raised up and said something like this gentlemen this is a holy spot I've been called of God to be his prophet stand on these grounds and proclaim his message and the message that I have for you don't you approach this ground stay off of here or the uncircumcised have you not read when Moses the servant of the Lord crossed over the river and the uncircumcised tried to impersonate him they all drowned stay off of this ground what schools he from we'll go in anyhow Elisha said if I'd be a man of God that fire fall from heaven and vindicate my ministry and about that time fire felling burn up 50 the King might have said lightning struck him so he sent another 15 the same thing happened unbelief man who Malkin scoffing make fun of the United Church of the Living God Shall Perish someday and I hell won't only be burning for a few minutes it might be a long time so it's holy ground God's anointed stands on there no uncircumcised or unclean thing can enter that spot that is true if impersonators try to act like it they're doing it you'll find out they'll soon come to naught but what does the impersonators vindicate that there is a real there's a real God there are some people who won't say they don't believe it but they won't act like they believe it but a person that knows God is a man that's born again of the Holy Ghost and filled with the power of God with a thus saith the Lord he goes forward they know something has struck their heart they know that they're hanging so Elijah was a man of God anointed that they did not believe look at David when he set with Nathan the Prophet David a manager God's own heart and he was in arted God anointed him King David is not only a king but he was a prophet so Nathan was a great prophet of the nation David is more or less a point and a prophet songwriter musician and prophesy really in its original is more like a a song when they prophesy then one day while the prophet and the King was sitting together David said it's not right for me to live in a house of cedar in the Ark of my god under attempt I don't want you to listen the notable words of Nathan he said David oh don't be able to get this I get between the lines David do all that's in your heart for God is with you when I think of that David do all that's in your heart for God's with you why cry out to me God's with you speak and go forward God's anointed you move on don't him a Hall around say this that or the other should I believe God should I trust him for this trust him for every breath that you draw it was a great general Stonewall Jackson who's been my favorite general since Joshua Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of man when the opposition is so great that's how I got his name of Stonewall he would not budge he'd no no retreat what could we accredit a man like that to a man when the Yankees come down by the thousands and he stood there in the minority but they'd never move him he stood like a stone wall all the rest of the rebel army had retreated back Lyons come along said what's the matter with Jackson why isn't he going he said he stands like a stone wall the other generals asked he said mr. Jackson a little-bitty fellow black-headed and blue-eyed always about five foot two inches tall very modest Myles speaking little fella said mr. Jackson how can you stand in such opposition master like he kicked his boot on the ground he said I never take a drink of water unless I thank God for it first that's where it is there's no retreat than God speak and go forward it's right that's God's Commission to his church we have no time to slack they say the revival is over it isn't over it's time that Pentecost is played out it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ then go forward there's no retreat there's no stain on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit we'll move on to somebody else and leave you standing you follow it you all that's in your heart for God is with you amen amen let's all so let's just stand a moment and let's just read the scripture and then we'll spend a few moments let's turn over and our Bibles again to loot the 24th chapter and the 44th uh verse and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you well I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to raise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things behold I will send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high Lord blesses where you may be seated as we listened to that portion of the message my heart's desire was is that as he spoke about Moses he was speaking about you and at the end we have such a tendency to when we listen to the message and that the messenger speaks we always take it back to him but but it's everything of the Word of God that applies the principles of the word of God applies to the believer also all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church so the principles that follow and apply to Moses many are the same principles that applied in fall to us he says that God called Moses a special calling and when God calls a man and anoints him for a certain duty yep that if you just listen to that you think he's talking about Moses and you don't make that personal God has called each of you we are called we are lected we are chosen so that statement when God calls a man or a woman that's what he said now can you put yourself in there the prophet of God said put yourself in every scripture put your name in there put yourself in that place so he's not talking that's what I wanted to play this this morning so that you would listen that this is the voice of God to us speaking and so and he's talking about the church he says when God called Moses a special calling when God called a man and anoint him for a certain duty he expects that every man to carry that out to the letter God doesn't want to give a man a commission and have him hee-haw around about it we have a commission going to all the world and preach the gospel baptizing them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall take up deadly things and it shall not harm them these signs shall follow them that believe you see that Commission wasn't just given 2,000 years ago it was given to the believer it's given to the believer so when God calls you he doesn't want a man he doesn't want a person with this calling the whole hung around about it and so that's kind of what's burning in my heart is that he said that you go up there and you wait and you be endued with power from on high elephant in dude as we said before means that you will be provided with you will be given uoq you will go up there wait and tarry till you have received something from the Father that gives you the power to perform every promise that's written in the Word of God that that would what peace he promised now I'm sitting here this morning and Moses goes on and we kind of read some of the statements Tibet he said here he says Moses had treats about one time in the presence of that anointing one time in the presence of that burning bush he knowed more about God than he'd learned in the books in 80 years of life what does he do with this province he does with to his children's every son that cometh to God must be chastened tried and tested in his word and God had called such a man and man as Moses God but Moses is a great deal like us every time it comes to a place till something has to be done so we're sitting here this morning let's just take a moment and look at ourselves we're sitting here to Mort this morning claiming to be be elected called out people of God I believe that okay I'm not doubting that two-bit i'm not going to browbeat anybody and say if if if we are the elected called out Church of the Living God now we also claim that we have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and if we receive that baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what the scripture said go up and Terry and wait and stay there until you receive the promise of the Father until your endued with power from the most hot you stay there till God provides you with the power now I believe with all my heart Vic that you testify I asked the other day how many receive the Holy Spirit and the hands went up I've got it I meant the Holy Spirit I I've had an encounter with that burning bush well now to me that means that there's a testimony coming out of your mouth that says I have received power from the father on high to live and perform every promise in the book now that puts us right on the same ground with Moses is that right I got notes here but I'm probably not going to be able to use them I can't read through it and go through it and everything there is a couple things I do want to read though and and I'll read them but so this morning there is enough power in this church isn't that true there's enough power to take to act upon every promised word that's in the Bible and we are commissioned by God and that's that's where we're this great conflict that is is taking place comes to pass so now we want to make a personal and talk to us this morning and just listen this was out a white cry speak 63 so now brother man is coming back and he's revisiting this the church has got to go forward the church has got to go forward nothing could stop the church if something rises up the church goes forward unbelief comes in the church goes forward disease comes in the church goes forward we go forward I like what he said I like Stonewall Jackson a man we got a Stonewall Jackson stands there and puts him in their seat ellia he said play safe it's over go forward where is Pentecost that commissions over it's not over where is the works they're not over hey I like how he P he comes and says it he says in the name of Jesus Christ he said let's go forward there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit we'll move on to somebody else and leave you standing you follow it do all that's in your heart God is with you so the question is that we've been given we've been given this great power you believe it you possess it there's a difference between if I could say it being made available to you and possessing it I kind of look at it like a rent-a-car you fly into a place there's cars available to you but you don't possess it but when you arrive you don't have to go get the car you've got the car you are the car you possess it so the path and this is what eat the point was is that every time that something came up they would run and say oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god god you're available to us you're available to us you you you've got the power to come and do this you've got the power to come and do that Oh God come in and work Oh God come in and deliver this person Oh God come in and do this but God wants to go beyond that with us he wants to have a greater fellowship than that with us he wants to say I have given you the power use it see do what's in your heart you you uh you meet somebody and you you you have a burden in your heart form you want them to be well you wanna meet D delivered and all all things is is is the Satan has captivated people he has brought them into bondage it's not that person I think pictures I watched one time some going through a very difficult time in in life and things and I went and watch some before and after pictures and these were pictures of young women and young men before they started using I believe it's like methamphetamines I think it's meth or crack or whatever it is and watch the effect of that drug and the change of their appearance and as I watched it in my heart i I didn't look no longer look at it as the physical I thought spiritually that that the wickedness of that disease and that demon honor those people and my heart went out we take alcohol I noticed in our country and and you know we shut down our churches but we kept our liquor stores open because that was a necessity for for so many people and it's not those people you understand today it's the power and people that fall into those places like my brother and different people and families members that's been a big problem in in in my family Irish family my family's full of alcoholics but they're it's not them you are said there's a power that is over them it's the power that is over them that has control of them and now sitting in the same place is a people with the power that's greater then that power he who is in you is greater than he'll is in the world York of people that possess of power you're elected you're chosen you're called now there's got to be something we would look at this power and you would say if I gave you something and I brought you something and I gave you something and I placed it in your hand and all of a sudden you have this possession in your hand I believe you'd start asking questions what is it what did you just give me what is it what does it do what do you want me to do with it what's it good for how does it work what's the result if you use it those are those are questions that that you would ask if I was to to give you something you'd say what do you want me to do with this first of all what is it what is it that God gave you what is it that you possess why did he give it to you what of what am I supposed to do with it what are we supposed to do with it we've all car claiming that we've had an encounter with the burning bush that's what the baptism of the Holy Spirit is it's an encounter with the pillar of fire it means that we have met him personally we are the guy that stood on the holy ground we are the guy that was at the burning bush when Pharaoh began to talk to Moses it like he said he said he said oh you just thought you seen a burning bush or that was just a roaring wind you thought you hear no Moses was the guy that was there he was there he newly experienced isn't that your testimony this morning you're the person that meant god you're the one that's had the transformation you're the one that's received the baptism of the Holy Spirit's not an imagination you've had the experience I've had the experience of being delivered I've had the experience of having hatred taken out of my heart I hate that I hate that many times I never wanted to feel for anybody I didn't want to care I didn't want to have a burden I didn't want to feel sympathy or pity a lot of times those emotions cause pain makes you feel sometimes weak but when I meet somebody and I see that they're under that bondage of that lines devil something happens in my heart I love that person I want that person free from that that wasn't me that was that pillar of fire that I met that was the effect that it had on my life it had an effect if it changes you it changes your attitude it changes your desires if it changes your affections you can't pretend when you bend there I know is this example to you very many times because but it was so dear to me and it was a wonderful opportunity that brother Bruce Emmanuel gave me to go into the center of a nuclear reactor and he said now there's radiation everywhere in here stay behind these lines stay within the containment don't get outside that containment and I told you that we were sitting in front of a great big pool maybe a pool this big it seemed brother Bruce and in there worse reactor cores new and used in EM and they're full of radiation and as they slowly release the radiation the heat of the radiation boils water and it boils the water so fast it turns it into steam the steam so powerful coming out of there that it turns the turbines and it produces electricity when that stuffs everywhere you can't see it and I remember I was looked at over that pond like that and I remember excuse me that I stuck out my finger and I went to point to the the which reactors were cold and which were dead and I'll never forget it I got my started to put my hand up and and brother Bruce's the safety guy out there and also you grabbed my hand and threw it down I thought what's up and I come to find out that if you get in to that nuclear feel it they will know it you have to walk through a machine that detects whether you've got it on you or not and if you got it on you the alarms go off and the bells go off and then there's a whole process and everybody in the whole place has got to go through it because they don't want that whole ego no they don't want that hey hey man they don't want that to go outside of there amen so what I'm saying is if you've been in the presence of that pillar of fire you will have the effect of that spirit on your low and Satan don't want it to get outside of you but we're called to contaminate the world we are the Holy Ghost covert virus of this age we are called to contaminate this world with the presence of God the one do they want to put a mask on you they don't want you to open your mouth don't wonder they want social distancing they don't want you to lay your hands on nobody they don't want you to testify what's happening to the church what's happened to the power this spiritual Holy Ghost reactor that's in this room where is it where are where's the signs of it where's the evidence of it what what we've got it listen to this statement and you can see the burden on my heart as I believe time is running out Moses being born with this great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the burning bush to deliver God's people the church was called you have not called me you have not chosen me I've chosen you go up into the bar and wait until you are endued with power on high then you are commissioned to go into all the world preach the gospel lay your hands on this if they shall recover if they repent they shall be saved go preach repentance of sin right go preach that repentance and remission of sins should be preached among all the nations go tell them that their sins which are many have been forgiven forget trying to give them to some intellectual knowledge of God go tell them the good news your sins which are many thing other sinners what they don't know is those sins have been forgiven at Calvary go tell them that you can repent of your sins and they will be forgiven didn't say little sins big sins that's Catholic teaching big sins little sins God forgives sin God replaces unbelief with belief that's what the burning bush did to Moses it changed unbelief to belief let's just read to deliver God's people that's what we're commissioned to do go find and deliver God's people they're still our people are still out there our people are still in bondage our people are still held by sicknesses that they don't are don't need to have why sit you hear rise when God commissioned people he don't want me him halt round about it if you're convinced your concern now see the great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing God had a purpose in it God's got a purpose of you being here he does III don't want I'm not gonna preach no more questioning whether you're a believer huh it's about time we have confidence in one another it's about time we quit trying to prove who we are by works we are who we are because God said that too we were and if God said so that settlement you are born for accuracy if you can only get to that place how much trouble you'd save God and yourself - I really want to save myself trouble because I've had my share of it but how much more was should my heart be to where I want to save God trouble you save yourself in God a lot of trouble if you would just start accepting that he gave you this power for a purpose you know and I see it just is plain as day I can see the continents on the faces of the people I see the darkness that's on their faces when the word of God I can see the self-judgement that goes on forget about yourself for a moment that burning bush was burning Moses turned aside to see and when he got there that Bush spoke of him to him take your shoes off you're standing on holy ground Moses didn't say Oh how's that bush burning it didn't matter how he knew that he was in the presence of God he knew that God knew everything he knew the secrets of his heart he knew where he been he knew what he'd done Moses had killed the man he knew everything about Moses he knows all about you he's not expecting anything of you he just wants you to come into his presence so he can do the changing Moses born and then after he was brought to the to the place where he was anointed known as the seed lying in there with the intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver the people and yet it never come to life and tell that light from the burning bush flashed across it until until he seen not something he read about not something he'd seen with his eyes but something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it how that did bring things to life now I want you understand Moses had a faith I'm gonna say something this morning okay and believe me I'm to the place now if you wanna throw me how back home for like I said I got lots of fishing poles but Moses believed with the seed that was in him but that didn't bring them to life now we all claim to have the seed of God that's our big claim we've got the seed of God we've got the seed of God we got the seed of God I'm afraid that our faith has come from the seed and not an experience from the burning bush there's something in you that believes have you noticed we all testify we all tell one another oh it's the seed it's the seed it's the seed the seed is in me okay that's why you believe that's our doctrine I've got ears I know what comes out of my mouth you're the seed you're the seed were the seed we be me because reseed why do I believe god senator prophet because the seed in me do you understand Moses was believing with the scene but that seed never came to life till he had a personal experience with the burning bush and he spoke to the bush and the bush spoke back here ye him that's what he said and noticed the seed laying there with the intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people with all the faith that were the electrolyte but we're also commissioned to deliver this people and yet it never come to life so he believed he had intellectual conception but that still wasn't considered to be brought to life now we call it life he said it it to life until the light from that burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about in the message of the hour not something he read about in the Bible but something he had seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back oh how that did bring things to life I think any man or woman or boy or girl and I think in the intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth never can have a full foundation standing until they have meant that light that brings that word to a reality now I'm not talking about the reality of the experience this morning I'm talking about the reality of the Church's possession of the power that they were endued with from on high I'm talking this morning about the reality of the power that God has placed in this body and it's believers not a reality of the pillar of fire we have that in photograph I could get you the drawer and the aisle number and such and such that you could find that in Washington I'm not talking about the reality of the message that it was true the reality of the pillar of fire and the reality of the cloud and the opening of the seven seals I'm not talking about the historic reality of this message I'm not talking about the reality that William branham's that was the name that was given to the man that fulfilled the prophecies of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17 30 revelations in 10 seven I'm not talking about that reality I'm talking about the reality of the power of the Resurrection that's in this building this morning has that been brought to a reality what's our cry we're elected were seed God sowed the seed hello Moses we finally got to where Moses was Moses knew he was called the deliverer the people he went and preached it what is intellectual conception and self recognition produce a dead Egyptian that's what he was going on but he said it needs until you have meant he said any bargirl man or woman with that intellect scepter what they think the work isn't so worth never can have a full foundation standing until they have meant that light and that light brings that word to reality let's ask the question again how many have received the baptism of the holy ghost and everywhere yes that was what God promised I will send you a comforter I will not leave you comfortless I personal pronoun will come again I'll be with you even in you until the end I'll lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness so we know that's a reality I think the church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known among that people and they see it something that they can talk to that talks back to them and that vindicates this written word now it doesn't matter how fundamental we are in our practice our church order our adherence to the dress code our preaching against sin it doesn't matter how fundamentally we are in following the message and I believe in sound doctrine you know I do I I was a lot harder in my younger days on enforcement but I understand that that nothing can beat the conviction of the Holy Spirit nothing beats the Lord letting a sister knows that her clothes are too tight or her necklines too low or her sleeves are too short or her dress is too high or her heels are too long now I've just preached against all of that I didn't have to call anybody Jersey Belle but if that pillar of fire if that burning bush if that holy spirit is present in our midst and we understand the reality of that presence and that reality of that presence is to deliver my people when people come into that presence that spirit will convict them they will know he's here you understand they can't feel your intellect they can't see your seed Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of men but I came to you in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Spirit in other words Paul said I meant the pillar of fire I was on the road to Damascus and I meant the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire spoke to me the pillar of fire commissioned me now I came to you with full confidence that God had called me and elected me and I was bringing to the Gentile people a deliverance of sin and providing them with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and it became the foundation of the church now remember when Moses met this burning bush that word was have indicated exactly it was the word Moses didn't have to worry what this voice all's about what is this being here because God had already wrote in the superinten assist your people with sojourn in a strange land but they would be brought back after 400 years and we'll come back to this country again for the iniquity the amorite is not fulfilled in other words Moses didn't have to ask the question he already knew do we have to ask the question are we in the end time do it do we have to ask the question that were the elect lady know what wasn't there supposed to be a people in this last day that's called out isn't there supposed to be a people that was going to be separated by a message that was sent forth isn't this what the promised in the scripture where is that who are they where are they somebody show them and so our answer is I got the seed now when Paul's answer he wanted to know well how are you baptized because he knew if they were baptized right then the Word of God promised them that they would receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost was the power that was in dude from on high to make this written word live now this words written is that right everybody's reading a written word the Methodists read the Bible this morning we read the Bible the Presbyterians the Baptist of every message Church everywhere we all read the Bible and people have done all kinds of things with their interpretation but Jesus's interpretation of this Bible was the works that I do you shall do also now so we're not talking this morning about going and getting the power we're not talking this morning about living right we're not talking this morning about holiness we're not talking this morning about the seed you have fulfilled all those pala fication x' you understand we're not trying you anymore we're not trying to give you a test of what your motives and objectives is and what you're accomplishing this scripture simply says do all that's in your heart so now this power has a motivating factor it's going to be your heart love the love of God shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit the seeds there the powers been given and we believed by the seed that's in us because the seed was in us is why you heard the voice because the seed was in you is why you said Amen because the seed was seeing you is why that you were brought into conviction but now we've grown and we've been through the ages we've been through the time we've been through the churches we've come up to the revelation of the seals we're well into the third pole we're at the ending and the catching away of the of the church so we know we've come down to that time where the resurrection power that was in Christ Jesus that was the power that was given it was a quickening power something to bring the Word of God to life now if you were predestinated and your names written on the book and your places for the resurrection and those scriptures that were written were written of you this power brings that word to life if not I am going to go into the grave if the Lord would tarry it's okay with me if he tarries that just meant I didn't fulfill that part of Scripture that I'm going to fulfill a different part of Scripture o grave where's your business Oh death where is your sting I have a crown that's waiting for me I'm going to fulfill another part of the scripture but that same power had to be there to bring to pass the scriptures that were written concerning me and that's what Jesus was the scriptures were written concerning himself you understand there's been scriptures written and prophecies made concerning you now there's got to be something that encounters the individual for them to bring the individual word that has been prophesied and spoken of them to pass and I'm sorry I got a wave this big meet at you but I haven't learned to preach with my left hand yet so you understand I'm talking about I'm saying we're moving past the seed we're moving past the power we've got it now where where Moses was why sit ye here arise when do we start to use the power that we have when do we quit crying and speak now remember what motivates it see this is where everybody got off on this nonsense of speak the word speak the word I always started getting around so how can you speak something that you're not how many times have you heard to say to one another just speak the word you know and so everybody wants to prove their faith by speaking the word no you'll never prove your faith by speaking the word you know what proves your faith is your heart do all that's in your heart you come across somebody and they're in bondage if your heart don't bleed you're not gonna be able to do nothing for them you're not going to be moved and maybe your heart doesn't always bleed for everything but I'll guarantee you God works on both ends he'll brief somebody by you and you don't know why but your hearts burdened you hate the bondage they're in you hate the devil that's got them broke down and here you've got the power but you run off to your prayer closet and you say oh God Oh God Oh God the Prophet said God finally got tired of it he said didn't I give you the power didn't I prove to your here the bride in the last stage didn't I show you that this is lady hacia didn't I show you the pillar of fire didn't I quit in the seed that's in you haven't I done everything there is to prove to you that you're that elect lady haven't I done everything to you to show you that you're anointed you've got the power but the powers to bring that word to a reality when twin when this is my question the church will never prosper until its believers have the love of God in their heart because without perfect love you will not be there when there's no more shame about the reproach there's no more there's no more how can I say that reserve but you accounted the esteem of Christ more glorious than all the riches of the world Moses esteemed his calling and election greater than all the riches of Egypt when you're there - and I had another statement that I was going to read to you but I won't - all close now as I can continue this another service but he esteemed what God had called him for greater than anything else the kingdom of God is like a man that's received a great treasure and he sells all that he can that he might possess that treasure you have been given this morning every single person in here who has meant the pillar of fire the pillar of fire is the Holy Ghost the abstract is the Holy Ghost the power that came from the father above was the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the presence of God any person that's ever come into the presence of God and been transformed by that presence just like I said if you put your hand into that radioactive field there's no way of faking it you got it it's on you you can't shake it off you can't wash it off it will be detected and if you've been there you possess it because he cannot lie so the powers here this morning let us reasons we close I don't know what I did with that other page and we'll read this I think he know that the time of the scriptures an all said that they'd already been there for hundred years just as we know now as a man asked me a few minutes ago about the coming and the rapture we know we're living the time out the time of the rapture is at hand and we're looking for a rapturing faith that can pull the church together and give it supernatural strength that can change these bodies that were living in we see a God that can raise the dead off the floor or out in the yard and bring him back to life again and the presence of him before us when we see of God who can take a cancer that's eaten a man to his shadow and raise him up to be a strong healthy man that ought to get that ought to give rapturing faith to the people that when that light flashes across from the sky and the Trump sounds the body of Christ will be quickly gathered together and changed in a moment and taken into heavens yes there's got to be something like that happen and our schools of theology can never produce that yet they intellectually are all right but we've got to meet that light we've got to find that something we've got to find that something each of us this morning has God to find that something that makes this word live in us and not only in us but makes this word live for others we've got to find that something and hear Moses basing his great calling upon the word and it was great until one day he meant this light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him that on the inside the intellect that believed it the faith that was based upon his belief in God that separated him from his mother so we're sitting here this morning we've all got faith we all believe we've all got the seed now we need something that brings that calling and that quickening to life something that we're died out for it something that this morning if somebody needs to come up for prayer and be prayed for and have the faithful wait hands-on that they might receive a deliverance or they might receive a healing that that comes to pass that we're no longer taking it and throwing it up to heaven and saying god take care of this but we're standing here saying I'm commissioned to take care of this I have been called to lay my hands on the sick and them see receive their deliverance and when we can see that about one another I'm going to go stand up for prayer I'm sick in my body and these people are called and elected and commissioned and have the power to lay their hands on me and I'll recover he doesn't want to be a god living in heaven anymore he wants to be a God living in his people we are the inhabitants with the faith upon his belief in God that's separating him his mother and now when he strikes in the presence of this light it anointed that that he believed what an anointing and he was commissioned now we know intellectually he heard his mother we know what was going to take place he know he was living in that day but where he found out that he was a failure so might his faith might have dropped back a little bit but when he comes to that bush God said I've heard the cry of my people and I remember my promise to their father Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I have come down personal pronoun I have come down to deliver them hey man he's here he's come down and he's called us to perform that word we've got to get back to work we've got to start using this power we've got to start dealing with all the questions that are keeping us from testifying from praying for the sick we let one scripture strangle us to death don't cast your pearls before swine well that's what Peter saw great big blanket come down full of swine and he said oh god forbid that I'd cast my furrow before swine and he said don't you call unclean but I have cleansed and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness we are called to go preach the remission of sins and repentance we are called to bring the power that you have to the people I thought of that saying power to the people and I thought oh yes praise God the power in the people to the people no church will prosper until supernaturally we can start bringing the promises to pass if you've lived by the faith that you received from your seat you believe because the seed inside of you has believed I'm asking you that you slip away and come contact face to face that you personally come into his presence and that seed that's in you becomes anointed for the purpose that he has called you and commissioned you we're moving out from the seat from the faith of the seed to the experience of the bush the real elect church is moving from the faith of the seed to the experience of the bush putting into action the anointed Commission upon the power that God has placed in them everyone has a power in here for somebody might be a friend might be a workplace might be a loved one but you have the power to impart eternal life you have the power to make a difference you have the power in my heart I stand here and I say old gone how can this power be unleashed in me how can I get in what place do I have to get to where I can bring this power to a lost and dying generation will I accept that I'm the last chance this world will ever get to see the truth my word is truth God sent a messenger you know it you've got the power to spread it you've got the power to proof that every promise in this book is true not only do you have the power you're elected and chosen of God to do it and he'll stand with you he'll not leave you he'll not forsake you he'll be with you even in you till the end what hindereth us let's don't be hindered no more let's arise let's take up our cross let's follow him let's testify let's pray for the sick let's pray for people deliverance let's tell people about it he'll stand with you he'll be with you why cry unto me speak and go forward I've already called you I've already commissioned you already proved you there's nothing more I can do you are the bride now let's show the world where the bride God proves his people by vindication that's it we'll go into that sermon another day how many believes it this morning the question is is that the desire of your heart do you want to make a difference in other people's lives I do let's stand together brother Billy would you come I don't title my sermons but if I probably would call this sermon it's more than the seed that's in me it's more than the faith that's coming from my seed there's something greater that God's got for us and I believe it and I desire it I don't know if anybody would like prayer this morning I invited a young lady to come to prayer and if she would like to do that I would love to pray for her [Music] you say why because I know a god that can do exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ask her thing I know a God that can give her the desire of her heart she may not feel comfortable but I want to give the opportunity because I know this God [Music] and I know what this God can do and if you're brokenhearted this morning if you're battling if you're struggling if you can't overcome if you'd make your way to the presence of that burning bush if you just step into that presence and let him and I say this people this morning has the power that power is here it's in this people to pray for you and you be well that power is in this elect bride here this morning to pray and receive that deliverance the powers in here this morning for you to be free from a burden or a habit that bounds you down where is it it's not here it's here you have the power let us pray if you feel that the body of believers the elect lady of Christ the bride of this last day the anointed elected people that have received the power of the Resurrection that if they ask in nowise will you be turned away let us pray our Heavenly Father we know that the seed went into the ground and as a seed came up in the ages and the last day the ship pulls away from the seed then that grain of seed sets in the sunlight and it ripens to full maturity until it becomes possessors of the resurrection itself and all that was in the church all that was in God was poured into Christ and how this church comes to the place it ripens in the Sun and all that was in Christ is poured into it and it becomes United with the word and them in the word become one and then he says the works that I do you shall do also and Lord we asked this morning that each of us in our heart would take that personal this morning that we take a moment to sit at our table to kneel at our cow just sit in the car then ask ourselves what am i doing for the kingdom of God what am i doing with the power that's in my life it's been freely given and now I'm to freely give what I what am I doing with what you gave me what did you give it to me for why did you give me the power of the Resurrection so I can resurrect others why did you give me healing power so that I could heal why did you give me salvation that I could save it's the power that does it it's not the person Lord and you've imparted into this church or not preached a message what are we building and Lord this is my heart we want a church that administers the power that you've given each individual fulfilling the anointing and the purpose that you place there nor reality I would like to pray we'd be happy to pray with them join our faith with the faith of the people of this building because you promised that whatever we ask for would come to pass and that power is present in this people I ask it this morning in Jesus name we just come to the front you hold mine [Music] you come my raging see you up with

people we come in contact with each day or there's each of us that sometimes I felt like we've missed an opportunity Lord maybe you told us to speak to someone or mention the gospel Lord and we might have missed it father we ask that you forgive us or we pray that you would give us another opportunity Lord maybe friends family those on the job those at school or they already see a life we may be
