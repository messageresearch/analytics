[15:07] song lord jesus thinking of all the
[15:09] times lord that

[15:34] own strength lord jesus and yet we
[15:37] have a word father that we need to
[15:41] master human ability lord
[15:44] the prophet told us that every time we
[15:46] raise up above the dirt
[15:49] father that we're above god help us to
[15:52] stay low and meek and humble and
[15:54] recognize where our strength comes from

[30:59] and in truth
[31:02] to serve a living resurrected god
[31:06] not one that's dead and buried in some
[31:08] tomb that
[31:09] an organization would be pointing back
[31:11] to
[31:13] the lord you rose on that third day
[31:15] victorious over death hell in the grave
[31:18] lord you are alive today in each one of
[31:21] your purchased members
[31:22] and we've brought our licks of fire here
[31:24] tonight lord just to worship you
[31:27] to give you praise lord and we're just
[31:29] asking
[31:30] lord once again as you are so merciful
[31:32] to come by our way this morning and
[31:34] break the bread of life and speak to our
[31:36] hearts lord we're so encouraged by that
[31:38] word lord
[31:39] and we're just asking lord that you
[31:41] would come by once again
[31:44] lord help your servant as you know the
[31:46] inability
[31:47] and the weakness that lies here lord if
[31:50] you could move the man
[31:51] out of the way and it would be you to
[31:54] come and that you would speak
[31:55] lord may the people's faith rise up
[31:57] right now lord just to
[31:59] look past a veil lord but to look at the
[32:01] promised word where two or three are
[32:03] gathered in my name
[32:04] there i will be in the midst lord this
[32:06] is what you've ordained
[32:07] man has not ordained this but lord if we
[32:10] can just get man
[32:11] out of the way the supernatural can come
[32:12] and you can have your will and way in
[32:14] the service
[32:15] so we're asking lord for you to break
[32:16] the bread of life now we love you
[32:19] we commit the service to you in the
[32:20] precious name of the lord jesus christ
[32:23] amen praise the lord amen if you can
[32:26] turn in your bibles we'll be reading out
[32:27] of first samuel
[32:29] chapter 3.
[32:32] it's good to see you on a sunday evening
[32:36] amen good things happen in the evening
[32:40] time
[32:43] evening time can be the favorite
[32:46] part of the day and i tell you what it's
[32:49] in the evening time
[32:51] that god has shown forth his great
[32:53] gospel light
[32:55] we're so thankful to be a part of it
[32:57] amen
[32:59] it's reading in first samuel chapter 3
[33:02] we'll read
[33:03] from verse 1 to 10. it says in the child
[33:05] samuel ministered unto the lord before
[33:08] eli and the word of the lord was
[33:10] precious in those days
[33:12] there was no open vision and it came to
[33:16] pass
[33:17] at that time when eli was laid down in
[33:20] his place
[33:21] and his eyes began to waxed him that he
[33:24] could not see
[33:25] and air the lamp of god went out in the
[33:27] temple of the lord where the ark of god
[33:29] was
[33:30] and samuel was laid down to sleep
[33:33] that the lord called samuel and he
[33:35] answered here am i and he ran
[33:37] unto eli and said here am i
[33:41] for thou callest me and he said i called
[33:43] not lie down again
[33:45] and he went and lay down and the lord
[33:47] called yet again
[33:48] samuel and samuel rose and went to eli
[33:50] and said here am i
[33:52] for thou should call me and he answered
[33:54] i called not my son lie down again
[33:57] now samuel did not yet know the lord
[34:00] neither was the word of the lord
[34:02] yet revealed unto him
[34:06] just a portion of scripture maybe to
[34:09] focus on that samuel did not yet know
[34:11] the lord neither was the word
[34:13] of the lord yet revealed unto him little
[34:15] did samuel know what god had in store
[34:17] for his life
[34:19] little did samuel know that he was born
[34:21] a prophet and he was going to be the one
[34:23] that the vision of the lord would come
[34:25] to
[34:26] there was no open vision but now god had
[34:28] brought a prophet on the scene that he
[34:30] was going to bring his word to
[34:32] and the lord called samuel again the
[34:34] third time and he arose and went to eli
[34:36] and said here am i
[34:37] for that is to call me and eli perceived
[34:40] that the lord
[34:41] had called the child therefore eli said
[34:44] unto samuel go lie down and it shall be
[34:47] if he call thee that thou shalt say
[34:50] speak lord
[34:52] for thy servant heareth so samuel went
[34:55] and laid down in his place
[34:57] and the lord came and stood
[35:02] and called as other times
[35:06] samuel samuel then samuel answered
[35:09] speak for thy servant heareth amen we
[35:13] just asked the lord to bless his word
[35:15] you may be seated
[35:17] i was just in my heart really moved upon
[35:21] that passage as i was reading it this
[35:24] afternoon
[35:24] when the scripture says speak
[35:28] my lord your servant heareth and i
[35:31] believe that is all of our desires that
[35:33] we would
[35:34] hear from the lord amen i believe each
[35:37] one of us may be in our heart this
[35:38] evening if we could just come with that
[35:40] type of
[35:41] attitude and that approach towards the
[35:43] word and we could just say
[35:45] lord speak to me i i'm hearing lord i'm
[35:48] listening
[35:49] to what you would have to say to me this
[35:52] evening
[35:53] no matter whatever however it would come
[35:55] whether it would be cutting whether it
[35:57] would be sharp
[35:58] whether it would be simple and whatever
[36:00] form or whatever way it would be said
[36:01] lord jesus here i am
[36:04] speak to me and i just want to also read
[36:06] from proverbs 29 18 it says
[36:08] where there is no vision the people
[36:11] perish but he that keepeth the law
[36:14] happy is he so just brother branham's
[36:17] going to refer to these two portions of
[36:19] scriptures as he takes this
[36:21] uh thought here and the voice of god in
[36:23] the last days he said it's a very
[36:24] outstanding time we realize
[36:27] that we're speaking from in the
[36:28] scriptures that it said
[36:30] there was no open vision in the days of
[36:32] samuel therefore
[36:34] where there's no vision the bible said
[36:36] the people perish
[36:38] we must have a vision and vision comes
[36:41] to the prophets and it's the word of the
[36:44] lord
[36:44] spoken to them so as we just spoke a
[36:47] little bit on last time how we must
[36:49] have a vision we maybe think to
[36:51] ourselves how can we have a vision but
[36:53] the prophet clearly is showing here that
[36:56] a vision comes to the prophets and it is
[36:59] the word of the lord that is spoken to
[37:01] him
[37:01] and so i'm so thankful that god has
[37:03] given us a vision
[37:05] he requires a vision and now he has
[37:07] given his people a vision here in the
[37:09] end time where the word would say
[37:11] where there is no vision the people
[37:13] perish god has given us a vision
[37:15] and i like to even look at that
[37:17] scripture and maybe a different way it
[37:18] says where there's no vision that people
[37:20] perish
[37:21] i'm so glad that god had a specific
[37:23] vision concerning us
[37:25] what he wanted to do with your life and
[37:27] how he wanted to mold you and how he
[37:28] wanted to shape you
[37:30] that there was a thought and something
[37:31] that he had in his mind a
[37:33] vision and a word that was pertaining to
[37:36] you
[37:37] that god was going to bring in a
[37:38] manifestation in the end time
[37:40] and so maybe it's not always in the way
[37:42] that it it's a good way that we approach
[37:45] it and i've looked at this scripture
[37:47] uh many times and understanding that you
[37:50] know just like in business you need to
[37:51] have a vision you need to have something
[37:53] before you something you're walking
[37:54] after because if you don't have that
[37:56] you're a wanderer you don't have any
[37:58] purpose you you might be tossed
[38:00] to and fro and that word is our vision
[38:02] and just even going in
[38:03] to maybe a deeper depth in my heart as
[38:05] the lord started to move upon me on that
[38:07] scripture
[38:08] is really showing me the vision of the
[38:11] lord for my life and how god has sent a
[38:13] prophet
[38:14] in the end time with a message and it
[38:17] was a specific message to me to teach me
[38:19] how to think
[38:20] to teach me how to act to teach me how
[38:22] to talk to wash me to cleanse me to show
[38:25] me
[38:26] uh the way that that i needed to dress
[38:28] myself and adorn myself in the word
[38:30] because
[38:31] outside of this message there was no
[38:33] open vision
[38:35] that could have been able to have been
[38:37] presented to you
[38:38] to make yourself rapture ready there was
[38:40] nothing that was on the face of the
[38:42] planet that had the ability we could say
[38:45] as the word would say
[38:46] oh in the in time oh there would have
[38:48] been no open vision here the word is
[38:50] calling for perfection it's saying
[38:52] let this mind be in you that's also in
[38:54] christ jesus
[38:55] it was crying out for a rapturing faith
[38:58] to be upon the face of the earth
[39:00] jesus said will i find faith when the
[39:02] son of man comes
[39:03] but oh if if man would have been left in
[39:05] that condition
[39:07] then we would have never been able to
[39:08] meet the challenge of the age
[39:10] but thank god he didn't leave a sealed
[39:12] book he didn't leave
[39:14] us with no vision but no he came with an
[39:16] open book
[39:17] he loosed the seven seals he revealed
[39:19] his very mind to the bride of jesus
[39:21] christ
[39:22] so now we can take this word we can take
[39:25] this
[39:25] and we can feed on it and we can see the
[39:28] vision that he has for our life and the
[39:29] vision that he has for us
[39:31] each and every single day and we can
[39:33] feed upon that and we can walk with that
[39:35] with vision
[39:36] and with purpose knowing that this word
[39:38] is making us rapture ready
[39:47] many of us can maybe just think of our
[39:49] condition i think that's what's amazing
[39:51] about the the
[39:53] the word of god and revelation as god
[39:55] expounds to you and breaks the word of
[39:57] god i mean there's many times
[39:58] i was fellas with brother jackson not
[40:00] too long ago and sometimes you'll read
[40:02] something or hear a quote
[40:03] and the light comes on and you see it in
[40:05] a greater way and you start to wonder
[40:07] like
[40:08] i never saw that i mean really
[40:12] is that where i am but really what it is
[40:14] it's if you've never
[40:15] had the revelation or if you've never
[40:17] experienced it you don't know the
[40:19] condition you're in
[40:20] and many times as we walk with the lord
[40:22] and he reveals his word and a revelation
[40:24] comes down
[40:25] it's not that we were just so low way
[40:27] down here but the word is so great when
[40:29] he brings you up into a higher height
[40:30] oh you could look back down and see
[40:32] where you were and that's what's
[40:34] happening as we walk with
[40:35] with the lord and we believe this word
[40:37] because think of
[40:38] uh some of us i don't know about you but
[40:41] i was out in sin
[40:43] and i thought i was having a good time
[40:46] you know i i thought really that that
[40:48] running out in the town and the things
[40:49] of the world that it had to offer
[40:51] i thought i was having a good time
[40:54] and you know season uh sins is
[40:57] pleasurable for a season
[40:58] but there comes a time where as a son of
[41:00] god look you can look at people in the
[41:02] world and
[41:03] and maybe some of your colleagues and
[41:04] work they can get away with a lot of
[41:06] stuff
[41:07] they can be successful they can get away
[41:09] and you wonder how can they ever get
[41:10] away
[41:10] you're a son of god you were called to
[41:13] manifest that part of the world he makes
[41:14] some vessels to honor
[41:16] and some vessels to dishonor and some
[41:18] people are just running after the things
[41:20] of the world
[41:20] and they're content and they're
[41:22] successful and they're enjoying those
[41:24] things of the world
[41:25] but you weren't called to that and you
[41:27] realize that maybe some of you
[41:29] maybe your testimony maybe isn't that
[41:32] you are so deep in sin and you're so far
[41:34] out there maybe you were a
[41:36] successful person and and business was
[41:38] good and maybe you had nice things
[41:40] but when you come to the revealed word
[41:42] of the hour
[41:43] and you come to a word that starts to
[41:46] sanctify you
[41:47] it starts to cleanse you it starts to
[41:49] change your thinking
[41:51] and as this word brings you up into
[41:52] higher heights it's when you come
[41:54] there that you look back down there and
[41:56] realize how miserable you really were
[41:59] and that's what i love about the word of
[42:01] god and as the as it continues to open
[42:03] up
[42:04] and to draw us into higher heights and
[42:06] maybe just something that's in my heart
[42:08] just
[42:08] even thinking along the lines of of what
[42:11] brother billy was ministering you know
[42:12] that god has given us a pattern in his
[42:14] word and
[42:15] and he so beautifully brought that out
[42:17] just in the prophet moses and thinking
[42:19] of the pattern of the tabernacle
[42:21] the things that he saw in heaven now he
[42:23] had brought them down to earth
[42:25] and everything in the order and all of
[42:26] the law if you start to think about the
[42:28] people who would become unclean
[42:30] god had given the prophet a message or a
[42:32] word
[42:33] that the people if they were obedient to
[42:35] it they could receive the atonement
[42:37] if the people were unclean if you walked
[42:39] over you touched somebody that was dead
[42:41] or walked over a grave or
[42:42] there was the the ordinances and the
[42:44] statutes there and the word
[42:46] well there was a a word where you had to
[42:48] go on the outside of the camp and then
[42:50] the priests would have to come and
[42:51] they'd have to slay a the red heifer and
[42:53] then they would take the blood and then
[42:55] they would
[42:55] uh burn it with i think cedar and hyssop
[42:58] and
[42:58] and scarlet and then they would take the
[43:01] ashes and they'd mix it with the water
[43:02] and then you could go through the stage
[43:04] of purification
[43:05] and then you could come back into the
[43:07] camp but if you were to reject the
[43:09] prophet's message
[43:10] and if you reject the word then you
[43:12] could never come to that place of
[43:14] purification
[43:15] you could never come to the place where
[43:17] you could come back into the camp
[43:18] or back into the fold so there was an
[43:20] order there was a pattern
[43:22] that god had given to his prophet if you
[43:24] were to reject
[43:25] the moses message then you couldn't come
[43:28] back into the camp you were left there
[43:30] in your condition
[43:31] and just thinking along those lines
[43:33] something that struck my heart
[43:34] is i just want to speak to you a little
[43:36] bit this evening on becoming one with
[43:37] the message
[43:40] by god's grace if this can just maybe uh
[43:42] uh
[43:43] uh if the picture can just come forward
[43:46] but you know that we know that you
[43:47] cannot separate the message from the
[43:49] messenger
[43:50] the message and the messenger are one
[43:52] brother branham said the message
[43:54] and the messenger are the same thing
[43:57] they're one in the same
[43:58] and as i thought on those things i
[44:00] started to think about you know
[44:02] brother branham tells a little story
[44:03] there about i believe it was world war
[44:05] one where uh the the armies had gotten
[44:08] in a condition where they were
[44:09] surrounded by the enemy and they're all
[44:11] hunkered down there and and there was no
[44:13] way out and so they needed
[44:15] help they needed another force they
[44:18] needed reinforcements to come in there
[44:20] and be able to get them out of the
[44:22] situation and what they had the only
[44:24] thing the only method that they had to
[44:26] send out word was
[44:27] is they had a little honing pigeon i
[44:29] believe is what they would call it
[44:30] a little messenger bird what they would
[44:32] do is they would attach a little message
[44:34] to that bird
[44:35] now if you were to think about this if
[44:37] you were maybe uh
[44:38] on the sideline and you're watching this
[44:40] uh warren fold and you got
[44:42] this group of men over here that are
[44:44] pinned down and the armies have
[44:45] surrounded and all their guns are on
[44:47] them
[44:47] and they got their artillery over here
[44:49] and they're in a gun battle
[44:50] and all of a sudden this little bird
[44:51] just starts to fly out of the trench
[44:53] there and it starts going off
[44:54] and everybody turns their guns and they
[44:56] start to fire and they're all shooting
[44:57] at this little bird you think
[44:59] what is the threat of this little bird
[45:01] why is a little pigeon causing all
[45:04] of these this military to start shooting
[45:06] their their
[45:07] their their bullets and everything at
[45:09] this little bird that's flying out
[45:11] what what how could this little bear be
[45:13] such a threat
[45:14] but you see that bird was packing a
[45:17] message it was packing a message that
[45:19] could deliver them
[45:20] it was packing a message that would
[45:22] identify their condition
[45:24] and it identified where they were and
[45:26] because that little bird was associated
[45:29] with the message
[45:30] they had become one and so that little
[45:32] bird was just as much as a threat to the
[45:34] enemy as the message and the force that
[45:36] was behind it
[45:37] oh you wonder why the devil wants to
[45:39] attack the prophet
[45:40] you wonder why that antichrist spirit
[45:42] wants to tear down the prophet of the
[45:44] hour
[45:44] oh a little humble simple man out of the
[45:47] hills of kentucky
[45:48] they want to tell what little what
[45:50] threat was he to anybody
[45:51] had no education was just a seventh
[45:53] grade education
[45:55] come out of the hills of kentucky no big
[45:57] homes no big organizations come on
[45:59] somebody
[46:00] didn't pile up money into the banks he
[46:02] didn't have a fleet of cadillac
[46:04] he didn't have a bunch of worldly goods
[46:06] that he could point to oh even in his
[46:08] own heart he got discouraged one time
[46:10] he was looking at oral roberts and billy
[46:12] graham and them and seeing their
[46:13] campaigns
[46:14] and he looked off into the side he said
[46:16] oh my and all i have is a little
[46:18] camper trailer for my office and he felt
[46:20] in his heart a little discouraged but he
[46:22] said oh look up
[46:23] that's where your treasures lie because
[46:25] what was he packing
[46:27] he was packing the message of the hour
[46:29] an end time message that was going to
[46:31] deliver a bribe
[46:32] that was going to bring you out of a
[46:34] lady oh see a condition
[46:35] oh come out from amongst your my people
[46:38] and be not a partaker of your pranks
[46:40] that was the message that he was packing
[46:43] oh and the enemy hates it
[46:44] he hates that little humble prophet why
[46:47] because the message and the messenger
[46:49] are won
[46:51] oh they kept shooting at that little
[46:53] bird but that bird
[46:55] kept on flying and it crashed down into
[46:57] the camp with a message
[46:58] brother branham soul beautifully types
[47:00] that out with jesus christ how he laid
[47:02] down his life for us
[47:04] but i want to say that also now we have
[47:06] a responsibility
[47:08] the messenger has ran his part he has
[47:10] gone off the scene but now there's a
[47:12] people
[47:13] that are packing the message and you are
[47:15] becoming one with the message
[47:18] you're the very light that's shining out
[47:20] into the darkness
[47:21] you are the message you're the
[47:23] manifestation of it you're the very life
[47:25] of it the very word of god
[47:27] uh pulsating in the end time the spirit
[47:30] of god
[47:31] living in a people why
[47:36] oh from faith to faith because god had
[47:39] ordained in the evening time
[47:42] that he'd raise up a prophet according
[47:44] to scripture that would bring forth a
[47:50] message
[47:52] you know many people sympathize with the
[47:54] gospel
[47:58] many times we sympathize with prayer
[48:00] requests
[48:02] we do our best you know i mean
[48:06] we hear it go over the pulpit many times
[48:08] but
[48:09] you know unfortunately we many times
[48:12] forget about it we let it go on
[48:14] and our brothers and sisters are there
[48:16] in that condition
[48:18] laboring and and pleading before god and
[48:21] but i pray that
[48:22] the holy ghost would help us to bind
[48:24] together in christian love but
[48:26] you know many people sympathize with the
[48:28] gospel and uh you know they they they
[48:31] they can maybe try to identify with it
[48:33] you know
[48:34] but i was just thinking about the prayer
[48:36] request and the time of need you know
[48:38] when it comes time
[48:39] for your son when it comes time for your
[48:42] daughter when it comes time
[48:43] for your wife or it puts you into a
[48:46] stage of desperation
[48:48] uh the scene changes a little bit it
[48:50] puts a little more urgency on it
[48:52] it demands a little bit more of your
[48:54] time and your attention you can't just
[48:55] continue on with the things like you
[48:57] normally were doing and act like
[48:59] nothing's going on because now this
[49:01] burden
[49:01] is constantly at you and and your loved
[49:04] one is sick or you have this affliction
[49:06] in your body
[49:07] and i was just even thinking about the
[49:08] time that uh we were there
[49:10] expecting evan to be born there at the
[49:12] home having a home birth
[49:14] you know we we believe the word we know
[49:16] the word and the word says to lay hands
[49:18] on the sick and they shall recover
[49:20] and we believe these things but
[49:22] sometimes it takes a situation or
[49:24] something to arise on the scene to cause
[49:26] a desperation in us
[49:28] where we cry out to god because we come
[49:30] into that need
[49:31] and there that this time it wasn't that
[49:33] i was maybe praying for
[49:35] a brother at another church i wasn't
[49:37] praying for a brother that i'm not so
[49:39] closely
[49:40] or maybe associated with the frequency
[49:42] that we fellowship
[49:43] uh you know and so maybe it didn't have
[49:45] the quite of urgency when i heard the
[49:47] prayer request
[49:47] but now it was in my own home and it was
[49:50] my own wife
[49:51] and it was my own baby boy that was
[49:53] going to be born and if god didn't come
[49:55] off the scene
[49:56] oh i could lose my wife i could lose my
[49:58] baby and it moved me into action
[50:00] where i cried out to god i said oh god
[50:02] lord you said if we lay hands on the
[50:04] sick
[50:05] they shall recover and something rose up
[50:08] i say there was another life form
[50:10] there was another seed it was it was
[50:12] something else on the inside greater is
[50:14] he that is in you
[50:15] than he that is in the wild that laid
[50:16] the hands on my wife
[50:18] and cried forth to the lord and he came
[50:20] on the scene and delivered
[50:22] i wasn't sympathizing in that condition
[50:24] i was in it it was me it was my reality
[50:29] and as i just something that come into
[50:30] my mind as i was thinking about that it
[50:33] i thought about this organization called
[50:35] mad it's a m-a-a-d
[50:36] it's mothers against drunk driving and
[50:39] you know i i've met some
[50:41] uh uh associates along the way and and
[50:44] such a tragic thing and i was just
[50:45] thinking about that though
[50:47] that they they have a uh they have
[50:49] something in common and
[50:51] and when they go through these trials
[50:53] and these hardships in life there's a
[50:54] group now that they feel that they can
[50:56] identify with
[50:57] people that have have lost other their
[50:59] child and
[51:00] and so they can talk to somebody who's
[51:02] been through it before and
[51:03] and maybe they can have helps and
[51:05] certain things kind of set up to help
[51:07] them through that time
[51:09] that they're going through and and so
[51:10] they have this mission statement that
[51:12] they're they're
[51:13] you know mothers against drunk driving
[51:15] and they oh they're wanting to end the
[51:17] drunk driving and in the violent crimes
[51:19] and they want to be a support
[51:21] a system to those uh that have have
[51:24] experienced it and
[51:25] and i thought it most interesting when
[51:27] the thought popped into my mind i
[51:28] thought i would look it up and they have
[51:29] a slogan that says
[51:31] we're heading toward a future with no
[51:33] more victims
[51:34] and i thought my that's certainly an
[51:36] ambitious thought there
[51:38] for them to say that we're heading
[51:39] toward a future with
[51:41] with no more victims but you know that
[51:43] becomes their voice that becomes their
[51:45] message
[51:46] and you know i couldn't be an advocate
[51:47] like they could right
[51:49] i couldn't be on the battlefront the
[51:51] same way they could and if maybe
[51:53] somebody else experienced something
[51:54] as traumatizing as that you know i
[51:56] wouldn't be able maybe to relate to them
[51:58] in the same fashion
[51:59] i wouldn't be able to maybe go out into
[52:02] the programs and maybe to the seminars
[52:04] and be able to give a a a a you know to
[52:07] give a statement or to
[52:08] be a good orator because people would
[52:11] look at me and they'd be like well yes
[52:13] that sounds good and all but what have
[52:15] you experienced
[52:16] what have you been through do you know
[52:18] what you're talking about
[52:20] oh but when one who's been there before
[52:22] when one has experienced it
[52:24] when one of it knows the hurt and the
[52:26] pain and they've been there before
[52:28] oh they can start talking in a way that
[52:30] i could never talk from because they had
[52:32] an experience
[52:33] and i was just thinking about that you
[52:35] know those those helps those things are
[52:37] good
[52:37] you know to to be there but i was just
[52:39] in my mind i was wondering but if if
[52:41] that ever keeps them
[52:44] from coming to you know for them to have
[52:46] that ambitious
[52:47] statement to moving towards the future
[52:49] with no more victims i thought my
[52:51] and that's maybe what they're rally
[52:53] crying what they're believing for
[52:54] and i thought you know for them to have
[52:56] a support group and have something that
[52:58] they're believing in and they have a
[52:59] voice and
[53:00] and they can come together and and maybe
[53:02] have things in common to comfort one
[53:03] another
[53:04] but i thought you know that would be a
[53:06] danger if that's what all they think
[53:08] that they have to comfort them
[53:10] if that's the only thing that they think
[53:11] they have that would be able to
[53:13] to give them comfort because then all
[53:15] that becomes is a broken system
[53:18] it just becomes something to keep them
[53:20] from coming to a source
[53:23] that can truly comfort them and deliver
[53:25] them and just in this
[53:27] little phrase right here i thought we're
[53:29] heading toward a future
[53:30] with no more victims i thought my
[53:32] goodness if that was
[53:34] if that was my message or if that was my
[53:36] heart cry
[53:37] if that's what i was rallying around i
[53:38] only know one thing i only know one
[53:40] gospel that can produce
[53:42] that jesus said if i go and prepare a
[53:46] place for you
[53:48] he said let not your heart be troubled
[53:51] ye believe in god believe also of me in
[53:53] my father's house are many mansions
[53:55] and if i go and prepare a place for you
[53:57] i will come again and i will receive you
[53:59] unto myself
[54:00] that where i am you may be also oh now
[54:03] you're talking about a promise
[54:05] now you're talking about a place a
[54:07] perfect place calling to you
[54:09] where there is no more victims where
[54:10] there is no more heartache
[54:12] and i love the word how the prophet
[54:14] refers to john 14.
[54:16] he says in that day you will know that i
[54:19] am in the father and the father in me
[54:21] and he says in that day he said that's
[54:22] this day
[54:23] when the revelation is made known oh the
[54:26] revelation has come forth it's no more a
[54:28] sealed book
[54:29] it's no more the vision has been opened
[54:31] you don't have to wait
[54:33] for some future thing to come to give
[54:35] you this type of comfort he said come
[54:37] unto me
[54:37] o ye who are heavy laden and i will give
[54:40] you rest
[54:41] there is a word that has come to you
[54:43] that no matter what condition
[54:45] no matter what situation no matter what
[54:47] heartache
[54:48] no matter what pain we don't want to be
[54:51] chalked up into some
[54:52] system or some way of thinking but we
[54:54] want to give ourselves all to the word
[54:56] of god
[54:58] i'm so thankful that this bible has
[55:01] become a new book
[55:04] i'm so thankful that i can look into it
[55:07] and see the mysteries and
[55:09] i can look into it and know exactly
[55:11] where we're sitting in time
[55:14] what uh what a privilege it is for us
[55:20] brother branham says in identification
[55:26] he says any man who's got a message of
[55:28] god fears
[55:29] nothing that's right
[55:34] any man who got the message of god fears
[55:37] nothing well
[55:38] do you have a message from god yes sir
[55:42] then fear nothing amen little old
[55:45] stephen stand up that morning before the
[55:47] sanhedrin he said
[55:48] why you stiff necks uncircumcised in
[55:51] your hearts and ears you do always
[55:53] resist
[55:53] the holy ghost like your fathers did so
[55:56] do you
[55:58] the bible said his face was like an
[55:59] angel i don't believe it like
[56:02] electric light or something an angel
[56:04] knows where he
[56:05] is standing an angel
[56:09] is scared of nothing he's a messenger
[56:12] from god
[56:13] and any man with god's message knows
[56:16] where he's standing
[56:21] god has a vision for you god has a
[56:24] pattern for you
[56:26] god has a word for you and a message for
[56:29] you
[56:30] and if you receive that message
[56:33] you can stand with no fear
[56:36] like stephen stood you can stand in the
[56:39] face of all adversaries
[56:41] and not waver
[56:46] joshua was a man who had a message
[56:51] and i i like the story i have the
[56:54] scriptures written down maybe if they
[56:56] could put up
[56:56] joshua 14 7-12
[56:59] maybe just to read the account of it out
[57:01] of the scripture
[57:03] it says 40 years old was i when i when
[57:06] moses the servant
[57:07] of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea
[57:09] to spy out the land
[57:11] and i brought work him word again as it
[57:14] was in my heart
[57:16] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[57:17] with me may the heart of the people melt
[57:20] but i wholly followed the lord my god
[57:25] oh my when everybody else was
[57:27] complaining
[57:28] when everybody else was fussing
[57:33] come on we're not we're not living in
[57:37] the wilderness back there but
[57:38] i don't know about you but i i've i've
[57:40] heard some fussing i've heard some
[57:41] complaining
[57:43] i've heard people that are unsatisfied i
[57:45] hear people that get uncontent
[57:46] hear people walking away from the
[57:48] message and people attacking the message
[57:50] and
[57:51] you hear all kinds of things but no
[57:53] we're we're like
[57:54] we're like caleb here nevertheless my
[57:58] brethren that went up with me
[58:00] made the heart of the people melt that's
[58:02] what some of these brothers are doing
[58:03] now
[58:04] oh yeah they spied out the promised land
[58:06] they believed the message they
[58:08] preached the message they went around
[58:09] the message preaching it
[58:11] but when it came to a time in their life
[58:13] where they realized they couldn't live
[58:14] the message
[58:16] they were lacking something they
[58:18] realized they couldn't take the land
[58:21] and so therefore the land that god had
[58:24] showed them
[58:25] they had to discredit the prophet
[58:27] because they were incapable of taking
[58:28] the land
[58:30] i tell you what if if if if they're
[58:33] saying hey this is the land and this is
[58:34] the vindication and this
[58:36] this is where the people are supposed to
[58:37] be and i realize in my own life i can't
[58:40] be there
[58:40] then i need to discredit the whole thing
[58:42] because if i'm not in there it shows my
[58:44] real colors
[58:45] so i got to start tearing it down and i
[58:47] started start to got to show the
[58:48] the the fallacy in it all right oh many
[58:51] men have
[58:52] have gone up they went up with caleb
[58:54] they spied out the lamb but all their
[58:55] hearts melted before
[58:57] they they couldn't meet the challenge
[58:59] for the age
[59:00] but here caleb standing there said but i
[59:03] followed the lord my god i believe
[59:05] there's young people here sitting this
[59:07] morning
[59:08] that are going to stand if the lord does
[59:09] terry maybe he carries another 10 years
[59:12] maybe he carries another 20 years i
[59:14] don't know he could tarry another 15
[59:15] years
[59:16] and you might be having to use gadgets
[59:18] and things like that as i was talking to
[59:20] a brother and saying
[59:21] oh a prophet came it was a hundred years
[59:24] ago and
[59:24] and this brother he has this testimony
[59:26] that was with him where is it well he
[59:27] died 40 years ago and he
[59:29] he was an old man when this happened and
[59:31] but no your heart's not going to melt
[59:32] just because you get further and further
[59:34] away
[59:35] from a manifestation of a word back then
[59:37] now you are the manifestation of the
[59:38] word now
[59:40] we can't keep looking backwards we got
[59:42] we can't look back to what god did
[59:44] and keep look looking forward to what
[59:45] he's going to do but realize what he's
[59:47] doing right now and that's you
[59:49] you are the manifested word of the hour
[59:52] you have a message and you must become
[59:54] one with that message
[59:58] amen and moses swore on that day saying
[1:00:00] surely the land wherein thy feet
[1:00:02] have trodden shall be thine inheritance
[1:00:06] and thy children's forever because thou
[1:00:08] has holy followed the lord my god
[1:00:10] and now behold the lord hath kept me
[1:00:12] alive and he said
[1:00:14] these forty and five years ever since
[1:00:16] the lord spake this word unto moses
[1:00:20] look where he said he spake it to like
[1:00:22] you mean you're living by another man's
[1:00:24] word
[1:00:25] well i got a good pattern right here
[1:00:28] if i if i read this correctly it says
[1:00:31] ever since the lord spake this word unto
[1:00:33] moses
[1:00:35] while the children of israel wandered in
[1:00:37] the wilderness and now lo
[1:00:38] i am this day for score and five years
[1:00:41] old
[1:00:42] as yet i am strong this day as i was in
[1:00:45] that day that moses sent me
[1:00:47] as my strength was then even so is my
[1:00:50] strength now
[1:00:51] to war both to go out and to come in now
[1:00:54] therefore
[1:00:56] give me this mountain where the lord
[1:00:59] spake in that day for thou
[1:01:01] heardest in that day how the anakims
[1:01:04] were there
[1:01:05] and the cities were great and fenced
[1:01:08] if so be the lord will be with me then i
[1:01:11] shall be
[1:01:11] able to drive them out as the lord says
[1:01:14] i love how he stands or says i'm more
[1:01:16] able today
[1:01:18] i'm not a young man anymore i don't have
[1:01:20] i don't have the strength of my youth
[1:01:22] anymore when i went over there and i
[1:01:24] packed the evidence was back over to the
[1:01:25] children of israel
[1:01:26] but because the word of the lord set so
[1:01:29] i'm more able today to perform it
[1:01:32] just as i was then because he wasn't
[1:01:34] counting on his own strength
[1:01:35] he wasn't counting on his own ability
[1:01:38] the prophet of god said that
[1:01:39] uh caleb had a trial
[1:01:42] 45 years or 40-year trial that he that
[1:01:45] he had to go around there in the
[1:01:47] wilderness that was his trial but he
[1:01:48] said because he believed god he
[1:01:50] possessed the gate of the enemy
[1:01:52] oh praise god we have a message that
[1:01:54] we're believing
[1:01:56] and by believing that message we're
[1:01:58] possessing the gates of the enemy
[1:02:03] any man with god's message knows where
[1:02:05] he was standing
[1:02:07] he had a message from god and he knew
[1:02:09] exactly where he's standing he knew
[1:02:11] he was more than able
[1:02:14] i was just thinking of
[1:02:17] something struck my mind as i was just
[1:02:20] thinking on becoming one with the
[1:02:21] message and
[1:02:22] believing the message and i got to
[1:02:24] thinking about how uh
[1:02:26] you know many people battle with mental
[1:02:28] illness
[1:02:29] and you know if you haven't dealt with
[1:02:31] people or met people or had friends or
[1:02:33] families of certain ones that have
[1:02:35] have dealt with mental illness it's a
[1:02:38] very
[1:02:40] a challenging thing and many times
[1:02:41] they're just being possessed by a spirit
[1:02:44] some they might call it chemical
[1:02:46] imbalance they might call it certain
[1:02:47] things but
[1:02:48] we know how the devil is he wars against
[1:02:50] the flesh
[1:02:51] and it's amazing to me that how these
[1:02:53] people in that condition
[1:02:54] they can start to say things and do
[1:02:56] things and believe things that are so
[1:02:58] um just impossible
[1:03:03] but yet they believe it with such a
[1:03:05] conviction
[1:03:07] and then you even just look at not to
[1:03:10] get into the just the evilness that's
[1:03:12] in the world but people uh they come
[1:03:14] become possessed possession they take
[1:03:15] thoughts and they take ideas
[1:03:17] even uh in the religious realms if you
[1:03:19] get over there in the middle east people
[1:03:21] are willing to buy into a religion where
[1:03:24] they think that strapping a bomb to
[1:03:25] themself
[1:03:27] think about it that they're willing to
[1:03:29] get into a place
[1:03:30] in their faith or in their belief where
[1:03:32] they're willing to strap a bomb to
[1:03:34] themselves
[1:03:35] and go into a shopping area or go into a
[1:03:38] downtown area
[1:03:39] and and kill themselves and try to take
[1:03:41] as many people with them
[1:03:43] they they think
[1:03:47] that they're doing the right thing they
[1:03:49] they think that what they're doing
[1:03:51] is truth and i just was thinking upon
[1:03:54] that and like my if somebody can
[1:03:56] can get into that type of condition or
[1:03:59] on the wrong side of things
[1:04:01] we should be like caleb and be able to
[1:04:03] get on the right side of things
[1:04:04] where no matter how impossible it seems
[1:04:07] because we have received a word that is
[1:04:10] crazy as it seems to the world
[1:04:11] if they can sell out themselves and they
[1:04:13] can die for their message
[1:04:15] if they can die for what they believe
[1:04:17] and we're not even willing to to just
[1:04:19] shape up our lives and to consecrate
[1:04:21] ourselves
[1:04:22] and get into prayer we're not even
[1:04:24] willing to dress better we're not even
[1:04:26] willing to honor the word of the pastor
[1:04:28] and honor the word of the prophet
[1:04:29] we're not even willing to just try to
[1:04:31] die out for the mess he's not asking you
[1:04:34] to
[1:04:34] to strap yourself to a bomb and go to a
[1:04:36] marketplace
[1:04:38] he's asking you to dress pleasing he's
[1:04:40] asking you to say amen to the word
[1:04:44] he's asking you to consecrate yourself
[1:04:47] and be in prayer
[1:04:49] but i wonder the problem is we're not
[1:04:51] becoming one with the message
[1:04:54] and so we're leaving part of it out
[1:04:55] because maybe we don't believe it with
[1:04:57] the whole heart
[1:04:59] and god is calling us to a place of
[1:05:01] total surrender
[1:05:03] and when we completely die out that no
[1:05:05] matter what the word says
[1:05:07] i'm willing to give my all the prophet
[1:05:11] talks about the condition of the world
[1:05:12] and how
[1:05:13] a man has gotten to a place where he
[1:05:16] says
[1:05:16] uh a man in a sixth sense as they've got
[1:05:19] along
[1:05:20] just fine for so many years but but now
[1:05:23] they they used to put god into
[1:05:24] everything here when they wrote the
[1:05:26] constitution they
[1:05:27] they put god into everything he says but
[1:05:29] now after 75 years
[1:05:31] they don't put god into anything
[1:05:34] uh they put all their their trust in
[1:05:36] science and education
[1:05:39] and put all their trust in politics and
[1:05:41] oh it's just such a
[1:05:42] an evil corrupt world that we're living
[1:05:45] in and the prophet paints this picture
[1:05:47] just showing how in the evening time
[1:05:49] and and we know we're living in it a few
[1:05:52] more years down the road and we
[1:05:53] i mean my i couldn't even imagine such
[1:05:55] evil
[1:05:57] i mean we're hearing things now that 10
[1:06:00] years ago i
[1:06:00] you might not even thought was possible
[1:06:03] people have lost their minds where they
[1:06:05] don't know
[1:06:05] uh they don't even know if they're male
[1:06:07] or female they they
[1:06:09] they don't even know uh uh uh what
[1:06:11] gender they are they don't even know
[1:06:13] what sex they are
[1:06:14] they they've totally lost a natural
[1:06:17] function
[1:06:18] they they their strong delusions come
[1:06:20] over them and they've been given over to
[1:06:22] a reprobate mind
[1:06:23] and you would think my in the heart of
[1:06:25] all this
[1:06:28] in the heart of all this evil and this
[1:06:30] satan's eden when the condition
[1:06:32] is so bad
[1:06:36] yet we're preaching a rugged gospel
[1:06:39] we're preaching a holiness gospel
[1:06:43] we're preaching things that seem
[1:06:44] old-fashioned
[1:06:46] we're preaching a a a message that seems
[1:06:49] so radical
[1:06:51] that if if god would tarry by his grace
[1:06:54] oh i would like for the church doors to
[1:06:56] stay open i don't know
[1:06:57] uh what the future holds but uh we
[1:07:00] preach something that is so radical to
[1:07:02] the world that the politics
[1:07:04] and the social movements and injustice
[1:07:06] oh if they got a hold and they trained
[1:07:08] their darts out of sure
[1:07:10] uh they they would they would turn all
[1:07:11] of that evil and all that hatred and all
[1:07:13] that anti-christ hatred
[1:07:15] on us because what we believe is so
[1:07:17] radical but i love how the prophet says
[1:07:19] here in recognizing your day and its
[1:07:21] message
[1:07:21] he says but just think right out in the
[1:07:24] midst of all that
[1:07:27] and the church denominations and their
[1:07:29] seminary and lewdness and everything
[1:07:31] god has took his prophet's word and
[1:07:33] chopped out a grind
[1:07:34] he said he would do it he's huge from
[1:07:37] that thing
[1:07:39] what he promised he would do
[1:07:42] he's hewed from that thing what he
[1:07:44] promised he would do who is that
[1:07:47] where is it what's he talking about
[1:07:50] does anybody here know what he's talking
[1:07:51] about he's talking about the bride of
[1:07:55] jesus
[1:07:56] christ he's talking about you and what i
[1:07:59] love about brother billy preaching this
[1:08:01] morning is
[1:08:02] as long as we stay with the pattern if
[1:08:04] we just stay
[1:08:06] with the word that word is going to take
[1:08:08] us right back to where we came from
[1:08:11] look yes the word says let this mind be
[1:08:13] in you which was also in christ jesus
[1:08:15] who thought it not robbery being equal
[1:08:17] with god yes he's calling for perfection
[1:08:21] amen but i love ephesians 5 25 where it
[1:08:24] says husbands love your wives as christ
[1:08:26] loved the church
[1:08:27] he goes on to say that he might sanctify
[1:08:30] and cleanse it
[1:08:31] with the washing of the water of the
[1:08:33] word the prophet said what is it going
[1:08:35] to take
[1:08:35] it's going to take a perfect word to get
[1:08:37] there it's going to take a perfect word
[1:08:40] producing a perfect bride
[1:08:43] and that's what this word is doing is
[1:08:45] it's washing you it's cleansing you
[1:08:48] it's sanctifying you
[1:08:51] why because we're going back to where we
[1:08:52] came from the spiritual amnesia is just
[1:08:55] slowly
[1:08:56] uh just getting falling away
[1:09:00] praise god we've seen the water tower
[1:09:03] we're walking towards home you know
[1:09:05] sometimes as the spiritual amnesia's uh
[1:09:07] are stripping away you see the water
[1:09:09] tower
[1:09:09] and all you know to do is walk tell the
[1:09:11] water tower look if you see the water
[1:09:13] walk towards the water tower
[1:09:14] i'm reminded of the story of brother
[1:09:16] branham one time he he got in the death
[1:09:18] march he was up there on the mountain
[1:09:20] and the storm blew in and he didn't know
[1:09:21] how how he was gonna find his way and
[1:09:23] his wife and
[1:09:24] and kid was down there at the end of the
[1:09:25] mountain there in a little cabin and he
[1:09:27] got on the little death march they call
[1:09:29] it and he realized he was lost
[1:09:31] oh all of us in the same condition we
[1:09:33] were lost
[1:09:35] we we didn't know where we were going we
[1:09:36] didn't even know how to
[1:09:38] to save our own selves
[1:09:41] but the lord started to deal with this
[1:09:44] prophet he said oh god forgive your
[1:09:45] stupid servant
[1:09:46] he realized he got himself up there and
[1:09:48] he got him lost and now everything that
[1:09:50] he held there to was at the bottom of
[1:09:51] that mountain
[1:09:53] and he he he he said i am an ever
[1:09:55] present help
[1:09:57] in the time of trouble and he just
[1:09:59] thought oh that was just
[1:10:00] maybe that was just uh my own thinking
[1:10:02] he kept he kept walking
[1:10:04] the lord spoke to him again i am the
[1:10:06] lord god i'm an ever present help in the
[1:10:07] time of trouble
[1:10:09] and all he realized that god was
[1:10:11] speaking to his heart
[1:10:12] and he said a hand come on his shoulder
[1:10:14] and turned them
[1:10:16] and as it turned him around also all the
[1:10:18] clouds and everything parted
[1:10:19] and he saw the tower up on the mountain
[1:10:22] and he had actually hung the wire from
[1:10:23] that tower down to the cabin giving an
[1:10:25] electrician
[1:10:26] electricity so he knew that all if he
[1:10:28] just walked this way
[1:10:30] oh he said i was walking clear into
[1:10:32] canada i was walking to certain death
[1:10:35] and the weather was going to be so cold
[1:10:37] no no doubt my own family would have
[1:10:39] died
[1:10:39] oh we were all in that condition we were
[1:10:42] walking to certain death but oh god
[1:10:44] rich and mercy he put his hand on your
[1:10:46] life and turned you around
[1:10:48] and he parted on the clouds and he said
[1:10:50] this way
[1:10:51] go this way this is the way and now
[1:10:54] we're just walking with our hands up
[1:10:56] praising god thanking god just walking
[1:10:58] towards calvary
[1:11:00] thank you lord jesus just keep your
[1:11:02] hands up all the way and he says
[1:11:03] oh i walked a little bit also i caught
[1:11:05] the line
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] hallelujah oh you might not have it all
[1:11:11] figured out you might not be able to see
[1:11:13] around
[1:11:14] every little bin you might not be able
[1:11:15] to say this look over here but i say oh
[1:11:18] god if you've seen the tower
[1:11:19] if the clouds have been parted just keep
[1:11:21] walking towards calvary
[1:11:23] with your hands up just giving them
[1:11:24] praise and he'll lead you every step of
[1:11:26] the way
[1:11:31] maybe just to turn a little corner here
[1:11:32] i want to read out of first samuel
[1:11:34] chapter 13.
[1:11:37] we won't be much longer
[1:11:41] we won't be much longer
[1:11:46] all right y'all get ready
[1:11:50] first samuel 13 8.
[1:11:56] says and he carried seven days
[1:12:00] according to the set time that samuel
[1:12:02] had appointed
[1:12:03] so now we have an open vision if you
[1:12:05] will here's the prophet samuel
[1:12:07] he has now given a word of the lord and
[1:12:10] maybe just to give a little background
[1:12:11] to this
[1:12:13] um uh you know the the children of
[1:12:15] israel were complaining and they wanted
[1:12:17] a king
[1:12:18] and so god uh sought out saul to be
[1:12:21] king and now as he was going along his
[1:12:24] way there
[1:12:25] after his father's donkeys that were
[1:12:28] lost saul was
[1:12:29] going through the mountainside of the
[1:12:30] countryside looking for some donkeys for
[1:12:32] his father
[1:12:33] and saw uh samuel meets him out there
[1:12:35] and says hey
[1:12:36] uh god has chosen you to be king and
[1:12:38] he's like me a benjamite i'm the least
[1:12:41] in the house of israel
[1:12:42] and so samuel now starts to tell saul
[1:12:45] everything that's going to happen he
[1:12:47] starts to tell him look when you depart
[1:12:49] from here the spirit of the lord is
[1:12:50] going to come upon you you're going to
[1:12:51] see these two guys over here
[1:12:52] they're going to have the donkeys when
[1:12:54] you get up here the prophets are going
[1:12:55] to be there
[1:12:56] and then i want you to come back over
[1:12:58] this place and i want you to wait for
[1:13:00] the appointed time and i'm going to come
[1:13:01] meet you and i'm going to offer a
[1:13:03] sacrifice unto
[1:13:04] the lord so now the prophet
[1:13:07] has received the word of the lord and
[1:13:09] now he has delivered his message to saul
[1:13:12] and now saul is walking in the vision
[1:13:14] now saul
[1:13:15] is walking in the word that has been
[1:13:16] given to him and everything is
[1:13:19] unfolding exactly as the prophet said it
[1:13:22] would
[1:13:23] amen and so now
[1:13:28] and he tarried seven days according to
[1:13:30] the set time that samuel had appointed
[1:13:33] but samuel came not to gilgai and gilgal
[1:13:36] and the people
[1:13:37] were scattered from him so they were i
[1:13:39] believe they were in a battle with the
[1:13:40] philistines they got in a little place
[1:13:42] where the people had been scattered
[1:13:44] but now according to the appointed time
[1:13:46] samuel is going to come and meet
[1:13:48] saul as he said he would and offer a
[1:13:49] sacrifice and saul said bring hither a
[1:13:51] burnt offering to me
[1:13:53] and a peace offering and he offered the
[1:13:55] burnt offering
[1:13:57] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[1:13:59] made an end of the offering
[1:14:01] the burnt offering behold samuel came
[1:14:04] and saul went out to meet him that he
[1:14:07] might salute him
[1:14:09] and samuel said what hast thou done and
[1:14:11] saul said because
[1:14:13] i saw that the people were scattered
[1:14:14] from me and that thou
[1:14:16] camest not within the days appointed
[1:14:18] well you just read it said right after
[1:14:20] he was done he
[1:14:22] the prophet showed up so he got a little
[1:14:24] hasty
[1:14:26] he said when i saw that they came in
[1:14:27] with not in the days appointed and that
[1:14:29] the philistines gathered themselves
[1:14:31] together at mcmaster
[1:14:34] look at he starts to justify the word
[1:14:38] here the prophet of god told him look if
[1:14:41] you just
[1:14:42] this is everything that's going to
[1:14:43] happen and now
[1:14:45] after seven days i'm going to meet you
[1:14:49] and i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm
[1:14:52] going to come to you
[1:14:54] and i will offer the sacrifice but it
[1:14:56] was in the waiting
[1:14:59] and the terry and for that word to come
[1:15:01] to manifestation
[1:15:02] that saul got a little hasty and he
[1:15:04] offered the sacrifice and he broke the
[1:15:06] word of the lord and it was for that
[1:15:08] reason
[1:15:09] that the prophet says to him look if you
[1:15:11] if you would not have uh disobeyed the
[1:15:13] word of the lord i would have
[1:15:14] established your kingdom forever
[1:15:16] but but now god has sought him out a man
[1:15:18] after his own heart
[1:15:19] and i just was thinking i'm on this and
[1:15:22] and even after this god is
[1:15:23] is gracious to keep saul he's still uh
[1:15:26] uh the k
[1:15:27] uh the king over the kingdom and and now
[1:15:30] he remembers what the amalekites had
[1:15:31] done
[1:15:32] uh to the children of israel and so he
[1:15:34] says you know what i want you to go into
[1:15:35] the amalekites i want you to kill every
[1:15:36] single one of them
[1:15:38] so he gives them the word of the lord
[1:15:39] and he goes down there and sure enough
[1:15:41] he comes back and he has this great
[1:15:43] victory he killed them all but he brings
[1:15:45] the king with them
[1:15:46] and and and there's all these uh uh
[1:15:50] rams and sheep and everything he's
[1:15:51] breathing but he spoiled but when when
[1:15:53] the prophet told him look when you go
[1:15:55] down there
[1:15:56] i want you to kill every woman every
[1:15:58] child every person every ram
[1:16:01] every sheep every goat wipe the whole
[1:16:04] place
[1:16:04] out but somewhere along the line in the
[1:16:09] in the line of duty saul started to
[1:16:12] reason with the word of god
[1:16:14] and so now what does he do he starts to
[1:16:16] justify his actions
[1:16:18] and now he's coming back and what's most
[1:16:20] amazing about that story
[1:16:22] is he comes back and and samuel says to
[1:16:25] him
[1:16:25] he says why why have you transgressed
[1:16:28] the word of the lord
[1:16:32] and him staring the prophet in the face
[1:16:35] says what are you talking about i
[1:16:38] fulfilled all that you commanded me to
[1:16:40] fulfill
[1:16:41] and he says what meaneth me the bleeding
[1:16:44] of these sheep
[1:16:45] and i feel oh god so many times in my
[1:16:48] life
[1:16:48] as i'm staring into the gospel and i'm
[1:16:51] staring into the bible and i'm listening
[1:16:53] to the message
[1:16:54] i wonder if there would be a a a voice
[1:16:56] come back and say
[1:16:57] what meaneth the bleeding of these sheep
[1:17:00] we
[1:17:01] say that we're fulfilling the word of
[1:17:02] god we say we believe all that the
[1:17:05] message says
[1:17:06] but we're not fulfilling the message
[1:17:08] because we're not becoming one with the
[1:17:10] message
[1:17:11] we must become one with the message that
[1:17:13] the very things that were spoken
[1:17:16] are being lived out through us so now
[1:17:18] the message is no longer
[1:17:20] in letter form but it's now living and
[1:17:23] in
[1:17:23] action in a people and so the very oh
[1:17:26] when the prophet of god says
[1:17:28] if you got a tv kick it out of your
[1:17:30] house there has to be a manifestation of
[1:17:33] that word
[1:17:34] it can't stay in the books and as time
[1:17:36] goes on we realize that oh okay
[1:17:39] uh we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:17:42] and so we have to have a spiritual
[1:17:44] discernment
[1:17:45] to realize how satan tries to creep into
[1:17:47] our lives
[1:17:48] and he tries to orchestrate
[1:17:50] entertainment he strives to orchestrate
[1:17:52] technology in such a way where we're
[1:17:55] still
[1:17:56] not honoring the word of god
[1:17:59] and so i pray that by the holy ghost in
[1:18:02] our lives
[1:18:03] that we could take the word and it would
[1:18:05] be interpreted into our lives
[1:18:08] and not a justification well you know i
[1:18:11] mean uh
[1:18:12] um you know he said a tv and i don't
[1:18:14] have a tv i have a monitor i mean
[1:18:16] look at church what's that
[1:18:20] they got a church god's one why can't i
[1:18:22] have one
[1:18:24] well look you if you want to justify and
[1:18:26] make all the excuses you want
[1:18:28] go right ahead but the word of god is
[1:18:30] telling you that you're making excuses
[1:18:33] you're being a soul and if you want to
[1:18:35] get rapture ready
[1:18:36] if you want to be adorned with the word
[1:18:39] and put on the whole armor of god
[1:18:41] then the word of the lord is continuing
[1:18:43] to come over the pulpit
[1:18:45] your pastor stands up here and he he
[1:18:47] speaks on these things on social media
[1:18:49] and how to dress
[1:18:50] and how to act why because it's the same
[1:18:53] word of god that was in the prophet
[1:18:55] it's the same word of god that's in the
[1:18:57] ministry that's now
[1:18:58] living in a people and we want to be
[1:19:00] faithful to manifest
[1:19:01] every word that was spoken
[1:19:06] it says there in first samuel says
[1:19:07] samuel didn't one let one word fall to
[1:19:10] the ground
[1:19:11] and i pray as the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:13] we're not going to let
[1:19:14] one word fall to the ground oh yeah you
[1:19:17] saw
[1:19:18] saul got weary and well doing
[1:19:22] if he would have just waited a little
[1:19:24] bit longer
[1:19:25] if he could have just waited just a
[1:19:27] little bit longer
[1:19:28] but it's many time in the waiting just
[1:19:31] like the scripture says though at terry
[1:19:34] wait for it it shall speak
[1:19:37] amen we'll just look for a little spot
[1:19:40] here to finish up
[1:19:41] i just appreciate the y'all's
[1:19:44] attentiveness this evening
[1:19:54] he said this he said to saul look just
[1:19:57] just go there and wait for the appointed
[1:19:59] time
[1:20:01] and it reminds me of there in the new
[1:20:03] testament when
[1:20:05] jesus told his disciples he said
[1:20:08] go ye there and tarry in jerusalem
[1:20:12] and wait until you're endued with power
[1:20:15] on high
[1:20:16] he's the same god tonight as he was then
[1:20:20] and what did they do they went and
[1:20:21] tarried there
[1:20:23] and the holy spirit was poured out and
[1:20:26] they were filled with the holy ghost
[1:20:27] they'd come out the windows and they
[1:20:28] come out the door said
[1:20:30] they said oh you y'all are drunk said
[1:20:31] men and brethren these are not drunk as
[1:20:33] you suppose but this is that which was
[1:20:34] promised
[1:20:35] by the prophet joel that i'll pour out
[1:20:36] my spirit upon all flesh
[1:20:39] is he the same yesterday today and
[1:20:40] forever i say he's the same god here
[1:20:43] tonight
[1:20:45] and i want to surrender myself i want to
[1:20:48] give myself holy over to him
[1:20:50] into that word just reading this quote
[1:20:52] and closing if the musicians would come
[1:20:59] recognizing your day in its message he
[1:21:01] says
[1:21:03] israel is back in her promised land she
[1:21:06] don't know how she got back there
[1:21:08] she was just automatically put back
[1:21:11] there why
[1:21:12] national force put her in her place now
[1:21:14] i'm going to say something national
[1:21:16] force put israel in her homeland
[1:21:18] national forest will put the church in
[1:21:20] the world council of churches
[1:21:22] but the power of god will put the people
[1:21:25] in the bride
[1:21:27] the world forces this way and the world
[1:21:30] forces that way but
[1:21:31] god forces upward the spirit of god
[1:21:34] which
[1:21:35] is the word of god my spirit my word is
[1:21:38] spirit
[1:21:38] and life will put the bride in her place
[1:21:42] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:21:44] the word
[1:21:45] then she's in christ we'll put her in
[1:21:48] her place
[1:21:49] no national force will do it
[1:21:53] now listen here no national force will
[1:21:55] do it but the national force did drive
[1:21:57] israel to the homeland
[1:21:59] the national forces of the council of
[1:22:02] churches will drive
[1:22:03] ever every organization into it but the
[1:22:06] power of god
[1:22:07] will raise the bride into glory
[1:22:10] out of it and something just struck my
[1:22:13] heart
[1:22:14] you know many times maybe you've heard
[1:22:15] it preached that way but many times
[1:22:17] we're looking for church doors to be
[1:22:19] shut down
[1:22:20] we're looking for the squeeze to come
[1:22:22] down we're looking for our brothers and
[1:22:24] sisters to be running down the street
[1:22:26] for what they believe and people
[1:22:27] shooting them in the back
[1:22:28] and we're looking for some some great
[1:22:30] calamity and if we're not careful
[1:22:32] we start to get a religious ideal like
[1:22:34] the churches have for the coming of the
[1:22:36] lord
[1:22:37] that some 900-foot jesus has to come
[1:22:39] down and we start in our mind
[1:22:42] thinking of some apocalypse that has to
[1:22:44] happen where we're all scattered and
[1:22:46] people are running
[1:22:46] and i don't know those things might
[1:22:48] happen but those are not the things that
[1:22:51] are going to put you in the rapture
[1:22:53] those are not the things that are going
[1:22:55] to make you perfect
[1:22:56] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:22:58] make you perfect and that is the word of
[1:23:00] god
[1:23:00] and the word out god has come it's been
[1:23:03] loosed
[1:23:04] it's been revealed it is here you're
[1:23:07] feeding on it
[1:23:08] that's the thing that's going to make
[1:23:09] you perfect it's not going to be some
[1:23:11] world council of the churches
[1:23:12] it's not going to be some squeeze coming
[1:23:14] down oh but it's going to be the power
[1:23:17] of god that's going to raise the bride
[1:23:19] of jesus christ
[1:23:20] into glory hallelujah i'm so thankful
[1:23:22] for that
[1:23:23] i don't have to look for some uh
[1:23:25] organizational movement
[1:23:27] i don't have to be looking for some
[1:23:29] world council of churches to tighten up
[1:23:31] i don't have to be looking for some
[1:23:32] national force i don't have to look for
[1:23:34] the national guard to start walking down
[1:23:36] through bedford
[1:23:37] and hunting me out and say you you
[1:23:39] believe in william branham
[1:23:41] i'm going to shoot you in the back and
[1:23:42] all of a sudden i'm like okay this is
[1:23:44] what i've been looking for the whole
[1:23:45] time
[1:23:45] i'm going to finally get rapture in
[1:23:47] faith i'm finally gonna be perfect
[1:23:48] because somebody's pointing a gun at you
[1:23:50] no it's not gonna be somebody pointing a
[1:23:52] gun at you you're gonna have rapturing
[1:23:54] faith
[1:23:55] because rapturing faith is already
[1:23:56] inside of you
[1:23:58] and the prophet came to reveal to you
[1:24:00] that you're going back to god where you
[1:24:02] came from
[1:24:04] hallelujah let's stand
[1:24:06] [Music]
[1:24:09] oh we got to become one with the message
[1:24:15] hallelujah i say are you hearing the
[1:24:19] message
[1:24:20] are you becoming one with the message i
[1:24:22] say say what he said
[1:24:27] say what he said the scripture says if
[1:24:28] you walk in the light as he is in light
[1:24:30] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:24:32] the blood of jesus christ
[1:24:34] his son cleanses us from all sin
[1:24:37] now the holy ghost is here the fullness
[1:24:41] of the word is here
[1:24:43] to perform in you the vision he had in
[1:24:45] his mind from the very beginning
[1:24:49] you don't have to wait for something way
[1:24:51] off in the future
[1:24:52] he's given you his vision he's given you
[1:24:55] his mind which is this word
[1:24:57] and now as we feed on it we become it we
[1:25:00] become one with the message
[1:25:03] listen to this now this is the prophet's
[1:25:07] word
[1:25:08] he says so how can how can you do it
[1:25:10] through anything else
[1:25:12] right we just said that
[1:25:15] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us
[1:25:17] from all sins
[1:25:20] says let this mind be in you which was
[1:25:22] also in christ jesus
[1:25:23] be there for even as your heavenly
[1:25:26] father is perfect
[1:25:28] so how can you do it through anything
[1:25:30] else but
[1:25:31] the perfect word of god
[1:25:34] which is the waters of separation that
[1:25:37] washes us from all sin
[1:25:39] from our sin amen that's right the blood
[1:25:41] of jesus christ think of it
[1:25:43] the dripping bloody word
[1:25:47] oh people people get hung up on the
[1:25:49] mercy seat
[1:25:50] is he on the mercy seat is the officer i
[1:25:53] don't care wherever you want to put him
[1:25:54] but i've received
[1:25:55] the bloody dripping word that's
[1:25:58] cleansing me
[1:25:59] that's sanctifying me that's justifying
[1:26:02] me that's filling me with his holy
[1:26:04] spirit
[1:26:04] there's nothing else that's going to be
[1:26:06] able to do it but this way
[1:26:09] and what is this word doing now i want
[1:26:11] you to hear i want you to become one
[1:26:13] with this message
[1:26:14] amen
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:18] amen the blood the word of god bleeding
[1:26:20] blood to wash the bride and amen yes sir
[1:26:23] she stands perfect i know we've heard it
[1:26:27] over and over
[1:26:29] but i i can't get i can't get tired of
[1:26:31] it i need to hear it over and over and
[1:26:33] over
[1:26:34] oh i love to hear who i am in christ
[1:26:38] the devil tells me who i am enough
[1:26:40] outside of christ
[1:26:42] he wants to try to remind me of my
[1:26:43] faults and failures he wants to try to
[1:26:46] attempt this sticky nature he wants to
[1:26:48] put thoughts into my head and tell me i
[1:26:50] thought him
[1:26:50] he wants to build nests up there he
[1:26:52] wants to try to run me down because what
[1:26:54] he doesn't want you to do
[1:26:56] is come to really know who you are and
[1:26:58] when you do what does he say the rapture
[1:27:00] will go
[1:27:01] realizing that this message is telling
[1:27:03] you who you are and it's saying you're
[1:27:05] perfect
[1:27:07] now we need to believe that
[1:27:10] she stands perfect virgin unadulterated
[1:27:12] she never sinned in the first place amen
[1:27:15] oh man shall not live by bread alone
[1:27:18] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:27:20] the mouth of god
[1:27:21] now i want to ask you who said that god
[1:27:25] said that and if caleb can hang on a
[1:27:28] word
[1:27:29] from the prophet moses to when he was 85
[1:27:32] years old to go up and possess a natural
[1:27:34] hand
[1:27:35] how much more can we receive a word from
[1:27:37] a vindicated prophet
[1:27:40] that you're perfect you're sinless you
[1:27:42] never did it in the first place
[1:27:45] oh i like this just ending on this
[1:27:47] scripture
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:49] paul says but when that which is perfect
[1:27:52] is come
[1:27:54] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:27:56] away
[1:27:57] when i was a child i spake as a child i
[1:27:59] understood as a child
[1:28:01] i thought as a child but when i became a
[1:28:03] man i put away childish things
[1:28:05] for now we see through a glass darkly
[1:28:08] but then face to face
[1:28:10] if i could say it like this when you're
[1:28:11] looking into a mirror in the dark
[1:28:14] you can you can't really make out what's
[1:28:16] in there you can maybe see some
[1:28:18] characteristics and maybe you could look
[1:28:20] in there like well i think that's me
[1:28:21] maybe that's me
[1:28:22] but when you're looking into that mirror
[1:28:23] in the dark oh you
[1:28:25] you really can't see what's going on
[1:28:28] he's saying
[1:28:28] though he looked through a glass darkly
[1:28:31] but then face to face i was just
[1:28:33] thinking about that how the word that
[1:28:34] says in
[1:28:35] in zechariah 14 7 says but it shall be a
[1:28:37] day
[1:28:38] which which be known to the lord not day
[1:28:40] nor night but it shall come to pass
[1:28:43] that in the evening time it shall be
[1:28:45] light
[1:28:46] and to me as i was looking at this
[1:28:48] scripture i saw myself standing there
[1:28:50] looking at the bible
[1:28:51] it's a mirror but i couldn't make it out
[1:28:54] it wasn't an open vision
[1:28:56] i couldn't see who i was i couldn't
[1:28:58] figure it out oh but then when the light
[1:29:00] of the message
[1:29:01] turned on the light it became an open
[1:29:03] book and i said
[1:29:04] mama that's me that's me that's me
[1:29:08] in there oh and you become one
[1:29:11] with the vision hallelujah let's sing
[1:29:14] this song
[1:29:36] oh
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:50] myself
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:30:05] to say this here brother billy read this
[1:30:08] quote
[1:30:10] he says out of the identified christ of
[1:30:12] all ages so you see the whole thing is
[1:30:14] god becoming tangible
[1:30:17] that's you god became tangible and a
[1:30:20] prophet it was the word made flesh
[1:30:22] now through that prophet the word has
[1:30:24] been spoken
[1:30:25] now the word that has been spoken is
[1:30:26] being tangible it's becoming flesh in
[1:30:28] you
[1:30:29] that on that great day that's to come
[1:30:31] when christ sets upon the throne of
[1:30:33] david and reigns in a million
[1:30:34] it's god tangible in earth he is he is
[1:30:38] now
[1:30:38] in you you are his attributes if you've
[1:30:41] got eternal life
[1:30:43] your life always was and you was god's
[1:30:46] thinking
[1:30:47] the color of hair whatever you are you
[1:30:49] was god's
[1:30:50] thinking and you're just materialized
[1:30:54] and i was just thinking about that
[1:30:56] you're just materialized
[1:30:57] something that he always had in his mind
[1:30:59] you were a part of him you were back
[1:31:01] there in that logos
[1:31:02] but something that's been materialized
[1:31:04] and and i was i was thinking on this i
[1:31:06] got to thinking about the vision of the
[1:31:07] prophet
[1:31:08] you know one time there was a family oh
[1:31:10] maybe they had raised their little boy
[1:31:12] they raised them right
[1:31:13] and they were driving down the road
[1:31:14] maybe one day
[1:31:17] and there was a great accident and he
[1:31:20] was laying there on the road
[1:31:21] dead could you imagine how heart
[1:31:25] stricken
[1:31:27] how how what a desperate situation that
[1:31:30] would be
[1:31:30] and you know if time would go on he
[1:31:32] would just be another statistic
[1:31:35] but little did that family know that
[1:31:38] there was a prophet
[1:31:39] halfway around the world who had had a
[1:31:42] vision
[1:31:43] and in that vision there was a boy
[1:31:45] laying that had been struck
[1:31:48] by a car and was laying on the on the
[1:31:49] street dead
[1:31:51] but now this was a vision it hadn't
[1:31:53] happened yet but this was a vision that
[1:31:55] god had given us profit
[1:31:57] but then there came an hour in a time
[1:31:59] where that vision was materialized
[1:32:03] oh and oh boy if it wasn't been for the
[1:32:05] word of the lord
[1:32:06] and if it hadn't been for an open vision
[1:32:08] that boy would have just been another
[1:32:10] statistic
[1:32:11] but he was part of the vision and he
[1:32:14] could come there and he said the rest of
[1:32:15] us just drama now
[1:32:17] because that little boy was part of the
[1:32:19] vision it was thus saith the lord that
[1:32:21] he would come to life
[1:32:22] it was that vision becoming material and
[1:32:24] that was just a little way god dealt
[1:32:25] with my heart
[1:32:26] of trying to understand the mind of god
[1:32:28] just as he would show him a vision there
[1:32:31] of something that would happen in the
[1:32:32] future that's the same thing with you
[1:32:36] and that says eternal as god is eternal
[1:32:39] the more that i
[1:32:46] [Music]
[1:32:52] surrendered
[1:32:54] [Music]
