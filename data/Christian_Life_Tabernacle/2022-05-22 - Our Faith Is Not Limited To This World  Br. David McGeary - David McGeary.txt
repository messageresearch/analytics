[Music] so [Music] oh is [Music] oh [Music] god [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] make sure [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] it's not foreign [Music] the ocean [Music] is [Music] earth [Music] oh is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] just come this morning open our service and pray and i saw him reading god bless you so do you want to welcome everyone in the house of god this morning amen [Music] let's pray father we lord we're so mindful of the song this morning the love of god lord how except for your for your hand reaching down dealing with each one of us lord we would be no different than any anybody else out in this world struggling to find a way attaching ourselves to causes lord and investing all our time and energy and building kingdoms and amassing wealth and lord we're so grateful that lord there's been something made known to us that we would not be lost in this hour of confusion lord we thank you for your mercy to us and for your love lord we thank you for this time to come together this service we want to be careful to commit it to you we welcome you in this place lord i pray that you would just rebuke anything that would stand in the way of your moving this morning lord we want to commit this to lord to worship you and that we might sit at your feet and learn of you lord that you might deal with hearts lord i pray that as we worship you that lord we would please you with our voice and lord we just commit the service to you to meet every need and have your way in jesus name amen amen you want to go ahead and turn to psalm 119 this morning we're just going to continue reading through a little portion of that this morning we'll be starting in verse 57 and you know as i was reading that portion of scripture this weekend there was a phrase in verse 57 that just spoke to me and it says this thou art my portion o lord you know webster's dictionary defines portion as a as an individual's part or share in something their lot their fate their fortune you know and i was just kind of meditating on that and that's kind of how life is you know there are some people their portion is to have great wealth and to collect vast fortunes and use that to build things and build names for themselves you know there are others who their portion is to have great influence to be able to build social networks and move great amounts of society in one direction or another you know there are those whose portion is to do great works maybe they drive causes and affect great change and then there are those whose portion might be great abilities might have skills whether it's in athletics or learning or music that's their portion that's the portion that's been given to them you know as david says in psalm 119 57 there are those who the lord has given him given them himself as their portion that's their portion they may not have the wealth or the abilities or the influence or do great works but they have him that's been their portion that's been allotted to them he's given them himself you know david said in psalm 16 verse 5 the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and my cup thou maintainest my lot while others might be enjoying a different portion in life for some the portion that they've been given is the lord you know when you think about how precious that is it says and as we'll read uh in psalm 119 it says in verse 59 i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies verse 60. i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments you think about how precious that is that we've been given him as our portion but it occurred to me how often as we kind of are living our lives we get focused on someone trying to collect someone else's portion we invest in trying to build wealth or hone our abilities or influence try to do great works borrowing from someone else's portion rather than appreciating the value of the portion that we've been given and we take the portion that we've been given and squeeze him into a little portion of our lives and so it was just kind of a reminder to me how important it was to realize the value of the portion himself that has been allotted to me you know it says in verse 61 the bands of the wicked have robbed me just an example of all those influences those voices that would try to rob me of my portion you know david in his prayer for deliverance in psalm 17 14 said from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fill us with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes this is david crying out from for deliverance from those men that would have their portion in this life but i liked what he said in verse 15 as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied my portion when i awake with thy likeness are you grateful for the portion that has been allotted to you in this life to think that he has given himself as a portion you know in my prayer just for myself as i was reading that that i would take care not to reduce my portion but embrace the full measure of the portion that he's allotted to me so let's just read that this morning it's just we're going to read those eight verses starting in verse 57 it says thou art my portion o lord i have said that i would keep thy words i entreated thy favor with my whole heart be merciful unto me according to thy word i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments the bans of the wicked have robbed me but i have not forgotten thy law at midnight i will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments i am a companion of all them that fear thee and of them that keep thy precepts the earth o lord is full of thy mercy teach me thy statutes amen amen [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] right [Music] [Music] i know [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] and we have responded [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] alive [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] highway okay oh [Music] oh oh hey oh [Music] oh [Applause] aren't you glad you won't die amen you already passed from death unto life amen amen are we thankful for that amen but james santiago has a testimony man if he could come at this time amen god bless your soul i have a short testimony and please excuse my english i don't speak good english so i wrote it down before i come here praise the lord i got prostate cancer since 2018 i felt uncomfortable and i always come to the altar to seek heal from the lord allow me to share to you a short coach from a chairman of brother burnham we believe that doctors help people i believe that god heals by medicine god heals by surgery god heals by understanding god heals by love just a little love goes a long way let somebody be all upset and just show them you care for them god heals by love god heals by prayer god heals by miracles god heals by his word god heals whatever source it is god heals by it it's god that heals for he said i am the lord that healed all thy diseases so all of it should work together and man in different ministries should work together for that see now but they don't do it because sometimes they're forbidden to take certain stance upon god's word because there are certain denominations doesn't permit them to do that but that doesn't stop the truth just the same god goes on healing just the same amen i went i went back to my doctor in the hospital the other day we greeted to each other and then he stand and turn on the computer after a while he said you are now totally healed mr santiago upon hearing that i raise up leave my hands praising my god all the glory be to unto god [Applause] i have buddy james come and pray for the request i just want to read it up quickly amen if the brothers that are taking the offerings can come amen you believe that he's a healer he heals by all means amen healing only comes from him this morning and i believe amen that should raise our faith this morning as we have requested to know that the same god is here with us but adrian writes god bless you brothers and sisters i want to thank god for another year that he has blessed us with my father-in-law jesus hernandez in his life with us god bless you says thank you amen brother

grandfather as his health is failing i pray for sisters peace family for several needs in her family should like to be remembered for that brother christopher general writes uh please pray for my uh for his situation for him his wanting to apply for visa to stay in the u.s we want to pray for him this morning that the lord will certainly touch him a man if you're having it upon your heart just live to end after him as brother santiago just come to bring this needs before the lord amen i believe he wants to show himself in our midst amen if we could just come and believe his word this morning he'll make himself known amen brother james if you just come in pray for the needs amen [Music] let us pray [Music] lord jesus [Music] you know my heart i'm so nervous standing in front of my brother i'm not used to standing in front of many people but i praise you and worship you will learn [Music] this day alone and this morning i pray that you're still the same yesterday today and forever if there is something my brethren needs from you what they need though for their life for everything maybe even their body is healed like me get the shake it is weak and yet you have the promise [Music] and we hold to your promised lord [Music] nothing to do but just to hold to your promise you said so that you will hear us and we believe that because you said so [Music] i pray that all that is needful this morning don't grab their prayers [Music] their needs i plead you and i cried out to you lord jesus [Music] i give you the praise and glory lord thank you for everything what you have done to me [Music] since i known you thank you lord jesus in your precious name we prayed amen [Music] you don't have to worry [Music] joy comes in the morning [Music] [Music] your is [Music] i know [Music] is [Music] [Music] no matter [Music] my [Music] [Music] oh is [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] amen amen you believe your life is in his hands amen we'll play a little a portion of the message this morning that will uh settle that beyond a shadow of a doubt let's just approach them now in a word of prayer if there's a special request that you have on your heart and you would like the lord to grant that to you wasn't that a wonderful testimony of our brother being healed amen i remember praying with him and i knew he believed that god could do it you know he does those things so you too can have faith in what you're asking amen i uh cosman [Music] shared this testimony [Music] i believe it was a gentleman at his work his daughter became a ill and and she was sick and and she started bleeding internally and they they felt that she had a mass or something on one of her ovaries or some they felt it was cancer and and uh so he asked brother cosman if he would come pray for his daughter and so i believe that brother andrew and brother cosman went up isn't that just how the lord sends a mountain to and and they went into the hospital room and they begin to to share the word of god with her and begin to talk about the things that have been opened up to us and and she just sat there they said like a sponge absorbing it in there are other people in the room and he said the presence of the lord come down it felt like they were at church and they they prayed for her and they went and and then uh he gets the text back do you you have that text with you why don't you come here and read it i want you to read i hear this amen you can anything i didn't say right you just you'd fix no just like brother david had mentioned um you know um brother joe the employee that works for me just every time we talk we always try to bring the world around and so he just said if i can if i can ask anybody to come pray for my daughter would be you and so we just had faith and asked but andrew to come with us and and so we get to the room and you know you can tell that the presence of god was in the room and so we just started talking you know and the lord took over we just started getting into the word and we were just talking to her about the lord and you know she was sitting there in pain but even within that pain you can tell that there was something inside of her heart that were just asking for more than really what she was receiving and so um you know there was just the presence of the lord was heavily deep in there and then at the end we just ended up singing a song and such a sweet atmosphere and i believe lies were changed in that and so yesterday morning right before the men's breakfast ended um i i had a scripture on my heart i sent it to brother chase that's her husband and so he writes this right as we were finishing our our men's breakfast says great news everyone we just got christie's labs back and christy is cancer free it says thank you jesus it says thank you jesus that means no radiation no chemotherapy no cancer hallelujah thank you amen amen now with those testimonies let's approach the throne of god with faith believing that those things that you ask for you shall receive he can do for you exceedingly and abundantly above which you can ask her to nothing's impossible for god let us just once again approach his throne our heavenly father [Music] lord we praise you for [Music] bearing witness to us this morning that you're the same [Music] bearing witness to us this morning that you're still on the scene and you're still touching hearts and healing and that all of your attributes father are just so manifested in the flesh in our day [Music] we praise you and we thank you and father with this encouragement from you to us we bring our petitions father the things that we desiring the things that we are longing in our lives our loved ones our physical needs our financial needs father the needs that we might have within our own personality and our own life-changing desires that we have for to be different [Music] it doesn't matter father what it is because we know that you know what we have need of even before we ask but father you desire us to ask you invite us to come to your throne boldly and to make our petitions known that we can offer them back to you in the form of praise and worship father you see the uplifted hands this morning of those who are raising their hand this morning and say father remember me pass me not by oh lord this morning but hear my humble cry i'm but a sinner but yet i'm needy and lord i don't see any other way than your mercy in your grace and i'm crying out to you this morning father to touch us to touch our needs to touch each hand that's raised each heart that's turns towards you each whisper father that is being prayed that you would be exceedingly kind and merciful to us this morning and grant these petitions that we could praise your name we ask it in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles let's open our bibles up once again we just ask you to be patient with the construction and the parking and and i know that it's uh very dusty out there and your shoes are going to be all brown and your socks are going to be dirty if you walk in the dirt and all those things but if god carries if he doesn't tarry we don't have to worry about it let's have a vote how many want them to come or how many want to finish the church how many want them to come first all right well the rest of you you can finish the church because i ain't going to be here if he comes amen i want to even so come quickly lord jesus but we'll plant our potatoes won't we amen open your bibles if you would with me to first corinthians the second chapter and the ninth verse of first corinthians the second chapter and the ninth verse and and this is a good uh for what we want to fellowship around this morning have a sunday school lesson and just rejoice in the good things of god amen isn't it a comfort knowing that he loves you you might not love him yet but he still loves you amen but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither having entered into the hearts of men the things which god hath prepared for them that love him amen let us pray our gracious heavenly father lord we ask you to take control of this servant father we ask you to bless your children father may your word increase and may you enlighten our understanding and may we grow in faith we ask you to bless us now as we have this time of worship and service and fellowship with you in your word in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated this morning um we're going to play this morning 22 minutes out of the message called things that are to be but i i would like just to make a few comments maybe before and then maybe a few after but what's moving on my heart is i have a great desire to go forward in the gospel i believe that god has things for us in fact the word of god said it hasn't even entered into our hearts the things that god's prepared for us so that tells me that god has things prepared for us that there's there's things that lie ahead so you would agree with me i'm sure on that that we're just not looking back and we're just not sitting still waiting for a future event to uh take place in other words i've done everything that i can do i i'm uh i believe and now i'm just waiting it out and that would be good there's a portion of that that's true that we're redeeming the time but we're not redeeming the time without expectation we're not redeeming the time without an understanding and a motivation and a revelation and an encouragement and an excitement electricity if i could use that terminology that we are not just going into something that we don't understand but god has something prepared for us okay it's greater than what that we perceive now because it hasn't even entered into our hearts the things that god's prepared for us so if we sit back for a moment at and then our our faith can be uh elevated if i could use that to terminology uh that our faith can come to a place that is not limited to this world and so if you know if i had a title it would kind of be along those lines that our faith is not limited to this world and and to explain that a little bit farther is that uh we don't measure our faith is not measured by the effects or changes we see on this present world so our faith seems to be boxed in to the life around us so as we're down life road we come into obstacles and as we go down life's roads we find ourselves in situations and in circumstances and then we feel the faith by faith is to move this obstacle or my faith is to overcome this adversary and and now we're measuring everything by this present world our faith is only related to the world that is uh present tense that we're in and so our struggle only rises up to meet the occasions that are in our circumstance so i say i have faith because our brother santiago brother james we know that he has faith but because his faith overcame that cancer that was in him his faith in the word of god it was okay i hope you uh it were inspired the way that i was that he knew what the prophet said that god could use doctors to heal he knew what the prophet said so his faith was in what god said now and he put his faith in that circle and he went in with faith and by that that faith he he he was able to accept his healing and testify and and we prayed uh fulfilling every aspect of the scripture anointing with oil laying on of hands agreeing together so we did all the things that god asked us to do and now we see the result of that testimony was that the doctor said you're healed i stood up and started praising god hey amen i don't know i'm sure he had a good doctor most doctors are wonderful people my doctor always wants to talk to me about the lord and and but you know he didn't say oh doctor thank you for healing me amen he praised god now that's great faith and we want that faith that there is a faith beyond this world because in other words we can believe for things that aren't even understood yet it is so if you can see where my heart is is if my goal is to climb out of this world i want my faith to be out of this world i want to have out of this world faith not faith that just works in this world but of faith that works in the world beyond this world because that if i have faith in that world that's the faith that's going to take me to that world and and so as we we're going to listen to this uh message for 20 minutes this morning and and then expand on it as you see the prophet god's going to talk to us about the lord fixing his life is fixing his death was coming and his life was fixing to end and so he wanted his disciples to understand that his death was for a purpose and and and he said these things he said to him he says you believe in god believe also in me now because that was i want you to attend that he was asking them to believe something that in the sense was contrary to everything that they'd been taught now he's going to mention this i'm just bringing out what he's going to tell you and and so he said in my father's house are many mansions i go to prepare a place for you that where i am ye may be also and we want we we always we have that boxed in so that whole that scripture doesn't expand in us the the way that it should because it's limited in our thinking to the escape of this life and this world i'm just getting out of here but it goes beyond that but look what they were asked to believe he was asking jews who already knew that there was a god that was supernatural above all things and the one and only true god now he's asking them he says you believe in the father you believe in god believe also in me what a thing to ask you can't understand asking a jew that what that meant that he was asking i mean you and that's what god's always done he's always identified his believers by challenging them and asking them to believe something beyond the realms of this world to believe something if i could say out of this world i mean you take abraham what he asked abraham to believe you know okay it wasn't a question that god could do it but he came down and said abraham i'm asking you to believe i'm challenging you i'm challenging you to believe that you and your wife are going to have a son now that's what god does he challenges you i'll read the statement to you so you can it'll bless you we'll do that after we listen but he challenged abraham saying abraham believed now abraham [Music] believed that god was able to perform that which he promised amen amen so we know we know the whole story of it but none of that was imputed to him there was no unrighteousness as imputed to abraham because he believed god believe it or not he believed god through his unrighteousness now i don't know if i could get away with trying to well maybe she would like that but trying to peddle a sister leslie off as my sister who's this woman well she's my sister why because if she's my wife i'm going to be killed that i wouldn't think that was a very righteous thing to do right but watch how god preserved this promise because abraham believed well you think that's pretty bad he does it again i mean if you wouldn't think that that abraham was a super saint i don't know all the things that went on in his life but i know one thing god challenged him to believe something and he believed it and god asked him to believe something now you look at moses what god asked him to believe he asked him to take a stick and go down and deliver thousands two million people out of egypt it's a great bible story isn't it we like to watch the movie and we think that's great in everything but you you know i mean just what what if god challenged you to told you to go to a certain place and and go to a certain hospital room at a certain hospital and there would be somebody in that bed and he wanted you to go there and to pray for him and to tell him that god was a healer i wonder what kind of mind battle you'd have i mean he asked a lot of abraham he was asked to believe something i i'd like what god challenged gideon to believe all right you're going to take these 300 people a pot and a torch and you're going to go down here and defeat this great big army gideon believed it before it happened and because he believed it it happened god asked abraham to believe it before it happened and because he believed it it happened he asked moses to believe it and before he believed it before it happened and we talked a lot about rapturing faith but it's got to be something that comes to us in the form of a faith in the form of a revelation something that we are believing that's going to happen not stuck in this world and our faith being limited to this world but our faith rising to believe things that are out of this world and there's a challenge because we're too absorbed with this world and the things that are going on in this world we get absorbed with the battles we have in our flesh i i i believe and i challenge myself for healing and i read the scriptures that promise me for healing and i i pray for healing i pray with others for healing but i wonder if i would take all of that faith and believe in a new body so that's what we're wanting to fellowship around this morning is that that they're believing so the the lord he makes these statements because his life is fixing to end you know it's amazing that the prophet of god preaches this portion that we're going to listen to things that are believed shortly before he was to be taken from the scene he preaches the rapture and he preaches things that are to be because there's a purpose there was a purpose in him leaving there's a purpose for all things god has a great purpose so if you would just join with me um as we're going to to play from the message things that are to be uh just 22 minutes and then i want you to absorb if you could uh there there's so much into it we'll make a few comments on it as we read along but i want you as you listen to this to think on the thought there is another world there is another world and that's the world that even now we're invited to live in sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus so he's going to read from he's going to read out of the the gospel of saint john the 14th chapter the first through the seventh verse so why don't we go ahead and stand and and i know we stood for the reading of our word but we'll stand for the reading of this and then just through the next 22 minutes listen as you find out that god has a plan he has a plan and now we're not looking at this world we're going to look at the world to come so lord bless you let's pray father bless these minutes of this tape to us father we believe that we're actually hearing the words of a true prophet i know the world today doesn't believe in prophets lord but they believe in their own thinking their own selves their own interpretation their system but father you chose to speak to the hearts of your children by the holy spirit and father we know that this life that we hear and sense it rings true with the hunger that's in our heart we ask you to bless now the words of our messenger to us in jesus precious name we pray amen now let us turn to saint john the 14th chapter very familiar scripture that we want to read tonight to draw from this a context the lord willing nearly all knows this it seems to be many times it's used in funeral services there was a time that i'd like to preach a funeral service to be to this world let it die and be born again saint john 14 1-7 i believe i have mark down here let not your hearts be troubled if you believed in god believe also in me and my father's house is many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go and prepare a place for you if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive unto myself that where i am there you may be also where i go you know and the way you know thomas sayeth unto him lord we know where thou goest and how can we know the way jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word and we won't refer to it again and uh times as we go on while we want to just speak a little lesson to the church last evening i was in yuma arizona or my home now i want to share before i lived in jeffersville indiana now i've been in arizona by a vision sending me there a few years ago and we resident there that now i don't have any church there brother greene uh our brother here with us has established a tabernacle where the one of the assemblies of god a church downtown assemblies they emerged and i think they all went in with brother brock and with brother gilmore left this church open and brother perry greene from from texas moved in and took the place which is associated with us we're glad to know that that uh brother greene has reopened this church that was closed and last night speaking over in yuma for the christian businessman i spoke on the subject of the rapture now that might been a strange subject to speak among at a banquet but most everyone there was christians and that's what it is on these campaigns like this or in a church i could say not how many of us christians probably every hand would go up you're a christian and so if we're christians i think we ought to be uh kindly notified ahead we don't have to just guess at it we're notified what our destination will be and i want to speak on that tonight and the subject is going to be things that are to be and now speaking last night on the rapture so tonight i want to speak on this subject that i might tie together with last night's message now there is going to be a rapture we know that that's in the future to be now jesus here is speaking about he's gone ahead to prepare a place for us let not your hearts be troubled now he was talking to jews said now you believed in god believe also in me as you have believed in god believe in me because i am the son of god and god in other words i my father are one my father is dwelling in me and what you see do i'm doing it's not me it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works god was in christ reconciling the world to himself it was easy for those jews who have been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural god but to think that that god had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son jesus christ god tabernacled in a body of flesh that was a little too much for him to understand but he said now as you have believed in god believe also in me for in my father's house are many mansions and i'll go to prepare a place for you jesus life was fixing to end here on earth it showed the people and proved to him that he was jehovah manifested in flesh by the great signs and wonders and the reference of the bible that he had referred to to himself and he proved that he was god manifested now i said when you see my life ending it's ending for a purpose and i'm going away to prepare a place for you that where i am there you may be also jesus therefore is telling his disciples that this life is not ended in death now saying this was a funeral text remember we death sets right before us and we don't know whether there may be some in this building tonight will not go out of here alive in this physical life that's how uncertain it is five minutes from now it could be that young healthy young people in this building can be a corpse in five minutes from now that is true and again it could be in five minutes from now with everyone be in glory we just don't know that's in the hands of god jesus said he didn't know himself when that time would be but that was in the hands of the father only now but he was telling them that after death there is life because i go and prepare a place that is to receive them shows that there he was speaking to him that there was a life after this life is ended and what a consolation i'd ought to give to all of us to know that after this life is over there is a life that we go into and as you get older that becomes more of a reality to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event it's uh not it's a continuum of this same life in another world another place your birth here was pre-planned i guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned did you know that your being here never originated just in a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by god before the foundation of the world the infinite god knowed ever to be to be infinite he had to no ever flee that ever would be in the earth and how many times it would bat its eyes that's infinite see our little our little minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite god he knowed all things therefore there's nothing allocator if we know the word of god we know where we are living we know that our that we're living in we know what lays ahead we see what we pass and the book of god is the revelation of jesus christ his works through the ages that was up to the book of revelation and then his promises that is to come so all of his promises are true god cannot speak any word without it being confirmed every word that he says has to come to pass before the foundation of the world some people mix genesis up there when he said god repeats himself no just your misunderstanding see god at the beginning he said let there be let there be let there be the world would just darken a chaos even when he said let there be light there might have been hundreds of years before light ever sprung in but when he spoke it it has to come to pass it must be that way see and he spoke his word them seeds was beneath the water when he dried off the earth then the seeds come up what he says must come to pass he said through the prophets i referred to it last evening like we take isaiah he said a virgin shall conceive who would think of a man that was thought of among people to say such a word is that a virgin shall conceive but because he a prophet is a reflector of god he is made so that he cannot speak his own words it has to be god's words that he speaks he's just like a reflector and he is god's mouthpiece and so therefore he said a virgin can shall conceive he probably could not understand it but god had spoken through him because he promised that he would do nothing until he revealed it to his servants the prophets then when he said that it was 800 years before that ever come to pass but it had to come to pass finally those words of god anchored in the womb of a virgin and she conceived and brought forth emmanuel unto us a child is born unto us a son is given his name shall be called the counselor the mighty god the prince of peace the everlasting father that had to be that way because god had spoken to the mouth of his prophets and all the words of god has to be fulfilled therefore we know that jesus has gone to prepare a place to receive a people unto himself amen who those people are i hope it's we are part of those people tonight if it isn't my friend god has made a way a condition that you can be included in that if you want to your own free moral agency you can act the way you wish to but now notice now in this world that is to come there is a world to come just like your birth here i said you always prepared god knew you would be here and now you know even things that your parents done uh people think that that isn't visit from generation to generation but it is over in the book of hebrews i believe the about the seventh chapter speaking paul there the writers i believe it was was speaking on um a great event that taken place with abraham that he paid ties to melchizedek when he was returning from the slaughter of the king and now he said that levi was in the loins of abraham when he met melchizedek coming from the slaughter of the kings and then he reckoned that to levi paying tithes also when he was in the lawns of abraham his great-great-grandfather amen and he visits the sins of the people upon their children from generation to generation that won't keep his word see you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that just think that you at one time i'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the chain of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the bedding ground and the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's fellowship now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of god because you have to be uh you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there to be a son of god you had to be in him always the chain of your life spiritual life tonight was in god the father before there was even a molecule and you're nothing but the manifestation of the chain of life that was in god as a son of god now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age you are the expressing god's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of god therefore you get why see you are in you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people in this neighborhood or you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation world knew that you would be here and when the word of the water the washing of the water the word fell upon you you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children sons and daughters of the living god if it be that the eternal life dwells in you now then if it was jesus was the fullness of god manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were here in him then because he was the word in the beginning was the words with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word was made flesh therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on earth you suffered with him and you died with him he was buried with him and now you're risen with him and manifested attributes of god sitting in heavenly places already raised resurrected to new life and setting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us the see our self-position placed in jesus christ now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living article of god that's right a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living martin luther could not express the attributes that we express because that that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corn of wheat that went into the earth i will re-quote this again you probably read the book that german making fun of me and said i was a fanatic of all the fanatics he was a he was absolutely against everything that's called god and even made fun of god said a god that could open the red sea instead take his people out and sit with his hands across his tummy and that through the dark ages all those people dying suffering those little children being eaten by lines you see the whole whole program the whole church is built upon divine revelation jesus said in saint matthews the 16th chapter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you what was the revelation of who he was and upon this rock i'll build my church in the gates of hell can't prevail against it the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the bible expresses it's growing in the bride to the full statute therefore if the corner wheat of christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the dark ages any grain that goes in the ground must die or it can't produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom and go into the dirt into the earth in the dark age to bring forth again in the age of luther and come on out to the full statue of the bride of jesus christ for this last day see there's no way therefore the bride and the rapture will come forth and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would sit all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be here and when when he made it that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us and when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour is prepared this is great for knowledge tells him all these things by for knowledge he's omnipresent because he's ominous mission ominous mission because he's omnipresent therefore by his poor knowledge now he can't be just like the wind over the earth because he is a being he just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells he even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore by his ominate being omnipresent being omni mission knowing all things then he is omnipresent because he knows all things you now you grew from your birth when you was born and presented into this world god knew that you were going to be here in this earth and you grown from birth to maturity things that seem so strange to you uh in your young womanhood young boyhood as children now seems very real you couldn't understand it when he was a child but now as you become adult you begin to understand and find out that everything was just set just right and you it really means something to you now so is it in your spiritual birth you do things that you don't understand when your little baby come to the altar you give your life to christ you do such strange things you wonder why you did it but after a while when you mature as matured christians then you understand it see there's something picks up you see why you had to do it your spiritual birth or your natural birth types your spiritual how how it fitted to you in this life as you grew everything fitted right in because you were made for that was it a strange thing the night that you staggered into the mission the tent meeting or the little church somewhere on the corner and something a preacher preached on a certain subject and you just fell right at the altar see see god knew that before the foundation of the world see it seems strange to you why you did it then but now you understand you knew what happened it's so fitting to you and this life and will be also in the life that is to come this world and this life seems that the advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you i don't believe in uh that a person just happened to be here by chance i just think when you come to the the world everything had to be for prepared for you or pre-prepared rather uh for you i don't hardly understand that how that we could think that a god that could prepare all these good things for us would not we could not put trust in him that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the eternal things it seems i say very strange and i i do not think that heaven is a place that my mother used to tell me about i believe that the church has grown from that to think that used to be a hundred years ago or two i think the old timers used to think that everyone that died went up to heaven and had a harp and and set up there on the clouds and and played a harp now they know that there was a place called heaven but they if that be so all the musicians that have it on us you see but it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing harps at all i believe don't believe the bible teaches that but that was a conception that they had before the fullness of the word come into existence or the opening of the seven seals that promised to us in this age that we then understand i believe that heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place for god starred us in our spiritual growth in this place and i believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't sit up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud we don't just strum our heart for all all from here ever but we're going to a real place where we're going to do things where we're going to live we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to a heaven a paradise just like adam and eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the garden of eden before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right back the first adam through sin taking us out the second adam through righteousness bring us back in again justifies us and brings us back in [Applause] all right we're just going to just okay because i i if i could say this i believe god wants us i believe he wants to expand our borders you know what i mean he wants us to if we could say to have the right mental attitude or death to have our our faith uh grow so let's just look at just a few things here and and uh just go by them over them again if i could real quick so he said he says there now we know that jesus has gone to prepare a place to receive a people unto himself who those people are i hope it's you know a part of him tonight if it isn't my friend god makes a way for those tonight and so he goes on he says you're on free moral agency you can act the way you wish to but now notice now in this world that is to come there is a world to come amen so there there's uh another world to come so that's the first thing that uh he begins to uh lay out to us uh he he makes this statement uh here he says now he says he tells us then that after death there is life so he he wants them to know he's telling them something this isn't the end of it that there is a life to come there's another world to come there is a world that's coming and he's gone to prepare that place for you but we've got to understand he's also preparing us for that world it didn't he say that uh when you verb when you uh were born you grew you grew that you grew up and then things began to make sense to you he says now your spiritual life should be growing so the things that we're growing into is going to allow us to make sense of the world that we're going into he's not giving you we we're mixed up we think that we're supposed to get all this power in all this revelation for this world but what he's trying to say our faith has to go beyond this world we're not believing for to change this world is going to be destroyed but there's another world coming another world order another law that's going to govern there's laws that govern us we know about the law of gravity right how many knows where this is going to go when i throw it up what goes up right now whatever if i threw this and this didn't come up there would be two things right you'd claim that i was a musician or is that a musician i don't know it's a mystery to me how they play those instruments but you would have to say that something happened because there's a law that governs that so what happens is we get bound by the laws of this world and our faith is limited to the laws of this world but god's not preparing us for this world he's preparing us for a world to come we are being prepared now for a world to come he is preparing his bride for the world that she he is going to take her into because when she gets into that world she's not going to operate the way that she does in this world her faith is not going to be a faith of this world it's going to be the faith of that world all things are done by faith with god without faith it's impossible to please god so remember if it takes faith to please god and god is an unchanging god then the faith that we please god within this world it would still have to be faith or revelation in that world we don't want to be bound we're just talking about i i think the world i'm amazed at how the world always satan always testifies of what god's doing and tries to take what god's doing because he understands what god's doing because god's people are moving away from his world but so he sees what god's doing he sees how he's preparing us and then he offers the same principles and back to his world so he can produce a copy how many have ever heard this saying think outside the box that's a rob that because god knows satan knows what god's trying to do he's trying to prepare his people to think outside of this world so he tries to say say that expand your minds expand your thinking inventions and everything but god is now taking his people he's telling them that you are the gene of god you're the manifested attributes of god all the attributes that god has you have all them that believed in him he gave power to become the sons and daughters of god so he as he as we're saying here he says to prepare a place he says and what a consolation that ought to give to to all of us to know that there is a that this life is over there is a life that we go into and as you get older that becomes more and more real to you as you begin to see the days of your life drawing close then it begins begins to pack up closer and getting ready for that great event it's now it's a continuing of the same life in another world another place it's a continuation of the same life in another world because we're just wanting to uh if i could say just lay uh that down so deep he says and so we talked about we know that everything was pre-planned so this world to come is pre-planned it's part of the plan of god so god calling you and choosing you and revealing to you the word of god is part of the plan of god not just the plan for this world but the plan for the other world well if i could get you to understand there's reasons why god is starting to share with us the the understanding that you're the gene of god that you're the attributes of god that god was a savior why because you're going to be a savior that's right you're gonna be a healer you're going to be delivering everything that god wants to write how many knows basic algebra all right so come here my brother all right i'm going to teach you basic algebra how many knows i'm a great mathematician you know why you don't know that because i'm not thank you that one little child that believes me this is a come here ellen this is b a b and y your c no you're b all right all that a was right he poured into b so now a is equal to b all that b was he poured into c so now b is equal to c right so if a is equal to b and b is equal to c then c is equal to 2a that's right no you don't get it two plus two is four right if a is equal to b and b is equal to c so he's the same he's the same he's the same so do these two have to be the same so if all that god poured into christ thank you a b and c [Applause] all that god was so okay and now we're being told this you're the gene of god right right you you're the all you are the attributes of god everything that god was right you are because you were in christ right when he went to calvary you were there when he resurrected you were resurrected with him he did all those things you were there so what god was he put in to be you were in be so from be he turned into c it's a the condensation of god it's god because he has a plan and you're part of the plan the part of the plan that you paid this god was going to be all that he was he poured into christ so christ came all that christ was he poured into the church because he knows he wants the church to be all that he is all the attributes everything that god is he he he pours it in you so there's another world coming he's because he says it's a continuation of this same life in uh same life in another world another place that's why he's getting this life here if it's going to be the same life it's not going to be a sinful life not going to be a carnal life but it's going to be a spiritual life that he prepared in you right and didn't we just hear him say that just a second ago he says now we know the word of god we know where we are living we know the hour we're living in we know what lies ahead what we see what we passed then his that's and then his promises that is to come now listen and the book of god is the revelation of jesus christ his work through the ages that was up to the book of revelation and then his promises that is to come and then i marked that quote uh i don't know if i i've i've got it here uh he talked about the opening of the seals and see if i find it right here where he's he talked about well i just won't uh he won't do it but i'll read this he says he says he says and now you are risen with him and manifested attributes of god the manifested attributes of god you are the manifested attributes of god so everything that god all the attributes that god has you are going you are manifesting them you are not manifesting them for this world can can i get that out are we so hung up in this world so controlled by the dimensions of this world all the things that we can see have to happen in this world before we can see him the only way that we can know that god's a healer is if we see healing in this world the only way we can see he's a deliverer is to see that he's a deliverer in this world we can we haven't even begin to imagine that i'm taking these attributes into another world where i'll be expressing them in another world another dimension a whole nother uh existence god has a plan for me in another world i don't want to be so hung up getting out of this world that i can't have faith for the world to come he says now we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word we cannot live by man's carnal thinking we cannot live you know there's a lot of denominations a political parties are a denomination groups and organizations and causes that people fight for the furtherance of cat lovers of america because that that is a denomination it's a system it's an organization we can't live by those things in other words he's trying to tell us you can't live by carnal things we've got to rise up beyond our world our faith has got to go out of this world and understand we are living by the things that god told us that we are which is that we're the gene and we're the attributes of god that's where our victory is in this world you want to overcome something in the world or you have an adversary you don't you don't fight this the adversary with a sword right he who uses the sword perishes by the sword but you win your victories by the attributes of god someone hates you and you forgive you you do good to them that hate you you you the love of god that shed abroad in your heart that's what you use you don't fight you you don't fight sin with sin you don't fight criticism with criticism you fight criticism with the attribute of humility you fight the things of god with the attributes of god if something is coming against you you you don't set up a battle plan the very attributes that god placed in you by placing himself in you right he said satan desires to sift thee of sand but i have overcome the world and and just the fact that you're the son and daughter of god that the gene of god what is a gene a genus the characteristics that are transferred from the father to his children if we want to check somebody's who their father is we give them a dna test right we find that gene that identifies them what identifies you as a son and daughter of god is the attributes of god in you because the world to come you're going to live by those attributes you're not going to take none of this junk with us the the carnal mind is what enmity against god but the spiritual mind is life and liberty and victory we can't figure out schemes if we would just live by the attributes of god if we would turn the other cheek if we would go the extra mile if we would give our coat if if the if that character of christ was manifested in the attributes it overcomes every adversary every adversity you don't have to have more knowledge i was dumber in a mud fence in school they gave the mud fence an a before they give me an a you know i had a lot of learning disabilities praise god you don't have to have you can have a learning disability and god still give you revelation praise god the church isn't built on your ability to comprehend it's built on the ability to receive the revelation that god gives you now do you get the revelation that he's trying to tell you you're going to another world you know if you're going to go to another world wouldn't you be wise enough to prepare for the world to come how many knows what you're going to take with you only one thing your character character is not a gift it's a victory it's molded in the fiery furnace of affliction it's proven it's time tested how do you know you have an attribute because it rises to the occasion every time because it is what you are [Applause] if you're a gossip you'll gossip every time you won't be able to keep your mouth shut well that sister you know she's just like this i just gotta help myself why are we new creatures in christ jesus why are we born again why does the old man die and all things pass away and all things become new he's trying to get us to rise our faith above this world our faith isn't measured by this world believe it or not our faith is measured by the world to come amen he says now if we are those attributes of god we can't live by creeds we can't live by dominations we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what and and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride's not a creed or denomination but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god amen what is the bride a living oracle a living attribute why are we going to be living oracles and living attributes of god if this world's going to be destroyed we're not living oracles of god and attributes of god for this world amen we're living oracles of god for the world to come oh church you're not called into this world we're being called out of this world this message didn't come it didn't come so that we could be victorious in this world but that we would be victorious in this world and the life to come in the world to come so i'm trying to say when we can start rising our faith up a little bit higher and then he goes on he says the attribute for this hour of living now and he talks about uh malachi martin luther he couldn't express it then right because it had to grow it it had to grow up it had to grow so it's growing he says the revelation of jesus christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the bible expresses it's growing into the bride to the full stature we see that right therefore if the corner wheat of christ fall into the ground the bot and did the bride will have to fall in the ground through the dark ages and the grain goes into the ground must die it cannot produce itself reproduce itself and the great church that he established in the day of pentecost by the sending of the holy ghost had to suffer martyrdom so he's explaining the plan of god right into the earth the dark ages to bring forth again in the age of luther and on coming up to the full statue of the bride of jesus christ for this last day yes and then i he says he goes on and he's talking about this growing he says and he talked about the world i'm just laying this back down to you you how you're he says see how it fit to you in this life as you grew everything fit it right in so when you're a child you didn't understand cars you didn't understand what was going on you didn't understand any of those things right but as you matured you began to fit in so uh okay you begin to understand why these things now we are maturing right so we should come to the place where we understand why we have these attributes why were oracles what's the purpose of it what's the purpose of god giving you love and peace and joy and depends what what what's the what's the purpose of of you being a savior do you know that you can impart eternal life that day in calvary right by the lane of your hands right the works that i do you shall do also all those things are given to you they're all giving you to a purpose but as we mature and as we grow those things are going to mean more to us now when we begin to understand there's a reason that god's given us those attributes there's a reason it was pre-planned it wasn't just pre-planned for here it was re-planned for another place he says this world and its life seems to advance as you mature everything seems to go right with you he said now i like this he goes on he says it's the same it isn't plain harps i don't believe the bible teaches that but that was a conception that they had before the fulfilling of the word come to an existence till the fullness of the word came into existence you understand the fullness of the word has come into existence or the opening of the seven seals that's promised to us in this age that we then under stand so there's an understanding i'm not going to go too much farther this morning because i just want to lay the the fundamentals of us rising above our faith rising out of this world and have an understanding that the character that god's developing you the attributes that he's maturing in you the gene because the spiritual life taps the natural life the gene of god as it grew up in a child and i i know as a child you look at a child so i see a lot of its mother i see a lot of its father i say but as that child matures more he becomes to look more like his father or her mother those those characteristics mature those attributes mature they tape on the greater form he says the natural life and the spiritual life run parallel they they type one another they're the same so i'm gonna sum it up by reading a couple statements to you that it might help us to understand what is transformative inspiring in front of us what god's doing what he's showing us he's he's he's showing us the world to come what we are going to be like in the world to come in the world to come we are the attributes of god and though that world is going to be run by the attributes of god jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and you have faith or say to this tree be plucked up and put into the sea if you had faith it would even be as you spoke so he's talking about what's going to come to the church so when you when you get over there he's saying you're not going to sit on the in a cloud there's work to be done how many automatically you thought work to be done you put yourself in a garden what if i would say there's worlds to be spoken to existence if you're going to be like him right and all that he was what did he do he created a world did he not and he went and lived on it did he not didn't he come and manifest the attributes of his father i'm just trying to get us to think outside the circle didn't he say we be little messiahs your messiah you think that this world is the only world that there ever was or is going to be do you think that it is possible that there's other worlds to come that you could speak a world into existence and go live on it that there's going to be work that god's planned out for you to do that you might be the son he sends to another world to save another people we've got them so limited we've got him so tied down you don't think that that the attributes that all that god was every attribute that was in god he put in you his very purpose was to express those attributes is it beyond our thinking that god might call his sons and his daughters into another world that they also could express those attributes in worlds to come no we're really what we want's the harp that's what we want all we want to think about is making it could i say it like this we're not even developing our skills for the next level how many anybody athlete or any musician or piano player you know what it means to go to the next level you know what it means to develop from chopsticks to chopin to beethoven's paschanada i don't know if i said that right you know what does it take to go to the next level you've got to hone your mind you've got to hone your skills any sport if they talk about at a certain level it's now it's all between the ears how you think how you approach how you look at the situation how you think it out in the world of golf you know what they call somebody that doesn't think it out that doesn't look at the distance doesn't know the elevation of the club can't look at the grass can't determine what how it's going to slow down they don't they don't plan their shot they don't visualize their shot just what's going to happen and then if if something else happens what's plan b they got everything of us approached and then they approach the ball the same way every time they call their routine they take the step out some guys plant this foot some guys turn this foot some guys lean they all got their way that they get into that plus and they got it all planned out you know what they call someone they don't plan it out they call him a hacker he just gets up there and hacks at it he don't know where it's going he don't know why he's doing what he's doing he has no conclusion do you understand why god's wanting to to bring these attributes to you to the surface not for this world our job in this world is to express to the world these attributes that's true but for us we're going to need these attributes to live in the world to come because it's going to be governed by these attributes you can't have carnal thinking there but just let's close with these things we're just i just wanted to uh you know to get us to to to uh just ex think of of things beyond this world notice when jesus created bread he took a piece of bread this is from the message god's gifts always find their place notice when jesus created bread this paragraph 63 notice when jesus created bread he took a piece of bread and created bread that had already been bred when he created fish he took a fish that was first created a fish and put another fish out of it is that right he took water which potentially would have become wine and made wine out of it is that right but we've seen him in our midst in this last day create things right out without anything standing there is that right to create a squirrel where there is no squirrel right he remains god he's just as much deity day as he was then and ever was or ever will be he's still god and challenging our hearts to believe it greater things than this without anything to hold and break off speak it and it'll be so notice now we find that he identified the works that he did identified that he was deity showed that he was for he said if i do not the works of my father don't believe me oh could not the christians say today if i do not the works of my savior believe me not now what's he showing us he's showing us something greater something greater than just breaking the fish and breaking that it was something that came from nothing it was greater it was farther up the road it was more advanced it was more mature coming into maturity coming into perfection sir don't look at that that there's some kind of story that's promised to you that isn't for somebody some other day some other time this is for you he's he preaching this to you it's your message it was sent to you he got it when it when he received it he believed it he was challenged and he accepted it abraham accepted it now god's asking you to believe something he's giving you a challenge he's calling you up to a higher place he's calling you to be the attributes of god he's calling you because he's preparing to leave this place oh i'm getting excited this is from uh this one's from perfect faith the great physician who is here who said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart we can believe that he can create squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask he challenged him to ask you want squirrels speak he didn't say take the squirrel bless the squirrel send that squirrel into the woods and out of that squirrel many squirrels will appear how many would accepted that is a great miracle but that's not what god did god was challenging him is that right he was challenging him to a greater level i'm looking for another quote that jackson would you go and look at my desk and see if there's a another piece of paper laying in there that has this next quote that i'd like to read he says the great physician he said if you say to this mountain and doubt not in your heart but can believe that he can create squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask he challenged me to ask it and i received his challenge in obedience to his word and i ask it and it appears god in heaven knows that's the truth can he also heal the sick if he can lift me with a faith up in this away even for the people even if they can't climb to that bracket see if they can't do it he can use my faith he can lift me to that place and i'll climb i'll i'm climbing for you i'm believing for you i'm speaking for you did you hear what he said i'm speaking for you i'm climbing there for you why why because he's wanting us to climb there we're not talking some of this pokey pokey stuff you're gonna walk out there and you're gonna say i'm gonna speak the word no he's talking about the reason he's building attributes the reason he's building character power apart from character is what satanic he's trying to rise our thinking above the circle the world calls it a box we we consider the world right round trying to get us to believe outside the world that all things are possible if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do that god is omnipotent you see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world into existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are that's what power is in the church now but is controlled by a law what do you think we're leaving we're leaving those laws of sin and death we're going into a world that is not encumbered with any belief or doubt well all things are possible where we'll work and we're closing the musicians can come i believe that heaven is a real place the same as this is a real place see god started us in our spiritual growth in this place right he started us in our spiritual growth in this place and i believe that heaven is a place just as real as this where we don't set up there for eternity and just sit there on a cloud look if i would say the cloud and we just don't sit there we just don't get to heaven and sit there i'm in heaven now no you've got attributes to express you're made in the image the first son created every son and daughter if they're equal to sons and daughters they'll be doing the same works the works that i do shall you do also why do we put a period on that and stop it here how many ever take that scripture out of this world however take those things beyond this place you see what i'm trying to say it's like there's a world around us a realm around us that we never go beyond we never think we look for everything in the scriptures is all going to transpire in this world but it hasn't even entered into our hearts and our minds the things that god prepared for them there's a lot more on the other side than there is here we're just getting our spiritual growth in this place we're getting our character we're getting to exercise we're getting to mature into the attributes we're getting to mature into turning the cheek going the extra mile doing the things he's building us that stature of a perfect man in christ not for this world but for the world to come we don't just strum a harp for all all from here ever we're going to a real place where we're going to do things what things the things that your attributes express i'm done doing things in this world i can't pick up what i used to pick up i can't walk as far as i walk i certainly can't run i have to use two hands to get one leg out of bed i'm not living i'm not even being formed for this world if this earthly body be destroyed i've got one waiting what's going to be going into that body what's the spiritual life of that body going to be like it's going to be a statue of a perfect man it's going to be possessing the attributes of god we're going to it he says we're going to work we're going to enjoy we're going to live a paradise just like adam and eve worked and lived and eat and enjoyed in the garden of eden before sin came in what did they do the prophet of god said they named animals they said this tree be planted there he says it's like mountains he says he said that they just it's later on in this book he talks about just throwing out mud out in the mountains he says but some people love mountains some people love seas some people love things what do you think you're going to do when you get there you're going to say to the beach you might find me on the sand somewhere and i'm going to say waves i want you six feet high see i want you flat today and i'm gonna walk out on the water and i'm gonna talk to the purposes when i walk up to the whale oh you think i'm crazy come out of your world come out of your limitations i'm going to walk on water and i'm going to talk to whales they talk about the horse whisperer i'll be the fish whisperer i'm going someplace i've got a god that's prepared something that my heart's longing for i'm not going to be hung up i'm not going to have the fleshly hang-ups of this sinful flesh adam talk to the trees and he named the animals this is just me thinking i wonder how many of those animals when he said lion a lion came and adam said this is a lion [Music] this is a zebra or whatever he called him he was a son of god he was a gene of god he had the attributes of god he created a paradise if we didn't have the law of god what would we do [Music] we'd go create a world i believe we're going to do that church before sin came in we're on our road right back there again right there again right right back the first adam through sin taken us out the second adam through justification brings us back in again justified us and brings us back in i i just [Music] i i just believe everything he's trying to do with me now everything he's trying to clean out everything he's trying to put in because we're at the end and he's preparing us for the kingdom to come in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would not have told you heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away [Music] he's not preparing you to stay church that's why he's working on you so hard he's preparing for you to leave he's preparing your spirit for another body and that theophany body will only receive his spirit it's created for that and you were created to be the inhabitants of the next world that's what he's asking you to believe you are in this world but you are not of this world he's maturing you in this life he's preparing you in this place for that place [Music] couldn't we just change our whole attitude how we look at this life everything's pre-planned everything's for a purpose he's got a plan for us i would not tell you if it were not so and if i go to prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you that where i am you may be also god bless you as we continue to go forward in things that are to be god bless you [Music] oh
