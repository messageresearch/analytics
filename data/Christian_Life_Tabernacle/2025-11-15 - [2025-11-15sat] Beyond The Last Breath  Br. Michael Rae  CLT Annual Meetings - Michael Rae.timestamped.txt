[12:28] there's a voice that's talking just to
[12:30] you. a voice that knows what you have
[12:33] need of even before you ask. And he'll
[12:36] bring it by and let you know, I hear
[12:38] you. I know you. I know what you have
[12:41] need of even before you ask. So if we

[12:52] chapter it says and the spirit and the
[12:56] bride say come.

[13:11] water of life freely. Amen. And let him
[13:16] that heareth say, "Come." Amen. Let's
[13:21] stand together tonight.
[13:24] If you have a request on your heart, God
[13:28] already knows what it is. Approach him
[13:31] with faith. Say, "Father, you know my
[13:34] heart. You know, I've asked for a new
[13:37] heart.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; You know, I want my heart inclined to
[13:41] you. And we sing that little song,

[14:04] ask abundantly
[14:06] cuz he is able.
[14:09] In your world, it might seem impossible,
[14:12] but with him
[14:14] all things are possible.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just speak your heart to him. He
[14:20] knows it. He loves you. Let you approach
[14:23] his throne of grace.
[14:29] Our gracious father,
[14:32] we approach your grace,
[14:35] your mercy,
[14:38] and the mighty throne that you sit upon.
[14:42] Father, we walk to it and we bow down,
[14:45] Father, and we kneel under the shed
[14:49] blood of our redeemer.
[14:55] And we make our requests known to you

[15:03] and you're all knowing
[15:06] and you can move on our hearts and
[15:09] you can speak to us
[15:12] and father we can listen
[15:16] and we can hear
[15:19] and blessed is he that heareth the words
[15:23] of these prophecies.
[15:26] And this evening, Father, we desire more
[15:30] than ever that our understanding would
[15:33] come open and that our revelation of
[15:37] your love would increase
[15:41] and the power of your might towards us
[15:45] may be our comfort and joy. Father, we

[16:14] ministers that have gathered, praying
[16:16] for the meetings, our visitors, Father,
[16:19] that have come to worship you with us.
[16:24] We ask that you be, Father, magnified
[16:28] and lifted up.
[16:31] And we ask, Father, in return that you'd
[16:34] be kind, gentle, and merciful to each
[16:37] one, granting them
[16:41] the desire of their heart. For we ask it
[16:44] in the most precious and most gracious
[16:46] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[16:50] Christ. Amen. Amen. I want to sing that

[51:08] that you'd come by our way, Lord, and go
[51:11] from seed to seed and heart to heart and
[51:13] mind to mind, Father. And will you touch
[51:16] us, Lord, and as we're God, under

[51:22] grace to look beyond the veil of
[51:24] humanity, Lord, and see the risen
[51:26] Savior, Lord, walking in your word and
[51:29] speaking, oh God, the promises, Lord.

[51:36] up into those realms of possibility,
[51:39] Lord. Lord, may where we're where we
[51:41] were feeling left behind or where we

[51:55] Lord. And as we, oh God, we're just
[51:57] pouring out our heart to you. I pray you
[51:59] bless this service, Lord. Bless the man

[1:09:01] We've spoke the praises, brother Sergio,
[1:09:04] that we have in our heart. We even said
[1:09:08] to the Lord, "Father, if we don't have
[1:09:10] the words, listen to our hearts."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; And he promised, he said, "Where I'm

[1:10:19] when you bring it before the blood.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; The blood of the lamb of God cleanses us
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; from all unrighteousness.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Tonight,
[1:10:31] it's our privilege to have
[1:10:35] brother Michael Ray with us. He's always
[1:10:38] been a great inspiration.
[1:10:41] to me personally and
[1:10:44] people say I heard quite a bit on my
[1:10:47] last journeys who's going to take this
[1:10:51] message over if everybody passes away.
[1:10:55] I said God's predestinated men
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; to be there to take it over and I trust
[1:11:02] every one of them's a man of God like
[1:11:05] brother Michael and loves this message
[1:11:08] like brother Michael. So as we invite
[1:11:11] him to come
[1:11:14] speak the word to us, let us rest.
[1:11:19] Let us rest in his goodness.
[1:11:22] Let us rest at his feet.
[1:11:26] Let us quieten our spirits and incline
[1:11:30] our ear
[1:11:32] because he's going to speak.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; he'll use a vessel of flesh, but that's
[1:11:37] our promise. Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And he'll speak the words of life.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So, as we invite, brother Michael to
[1:11:48] minister the word of God, I'd like to
[1:11:50] sing that song that means so much to me.
[1:11:54] There is a blood.
[1:11:56] And if you'd help me sing it, sister do
[1:11:58] it.
[1:12:00] There's a blood, isn't there? Tonight.

[1:18:26] So if we can just give a little bit back
[1:18:28] to you here tonight let's give my give
[1:18:31] myself over to the Holy Spirit. Let him
[1:18:33] speak to you tonight. Amen. I was
[1:18:37] pondering just the services and the
[1:18:39] weekend and I was just thinking about
[1:18:42] just all the burdens that are
[1:18:43] represented here, the needs that are
[1:18:46] represented here. And I just was at home
[1:18:48] in my study and I thought, Lord, what
[1:18:51] what do you desire to do to with these
[1:18:54] precious believers? And they've labored
[1:18:57] and they're working hard. They've set
[1:18:59] time aside and they've put in their
[1:19:01] funds and their time and they've cooked
[1:19:03] and they've prepared and they've cleaned
[1:19:05] and
[1:19:07] all all to create a moment. All to
[1:19:10] create a moment. Not just to have a
[1:19:12] gathering and eat dinner together and
[1:19:14] have the best brisket known to North
[1:19:17] America or to the world. That's that's
[1:19:18] not the point. The point is so that he
[1:19:21] can come
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; and that you can actually be so impacted
[1:19:25] and changed that this weekend of
[1:19:28] meetings you can point back to and say
[1:19:31] there
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; my God met me.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I pray the services and even
[1:19:36] last night just such a special move of
[1:19:38] God as the Holy Spirit moved so tenderly
[1:19:41] and sitting in the chair there at the
[1:19:43] very end and brother Billy started to
[1:19:45] sing the song stay.
[1:19:48] I just love that song.
[1:19:50] That song can really only be sung at a
[1:19:52] very special moment of a service when
[1:19:55] the Holy Spirit has come in such a
[1:19:56] tender way. And then that song just can
[1:19:59] come and you can start to just to tell
[1:20:01] him, "Lord, just stay a little bit more.
[1:20:04] You've come, you've tenderly moved, and
[1:20:05] you dealt with our hearts, but just just
[1:20:07] a little more. Just stay." And that was
[1:20:10] just how it was last night. I pray you
[1:20:13] were able to drink from the fountain of
[1:20:15] life.
[1:20:17] But the Lord tonight has something a
[1:20:19] little more maybe.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And so we'll just pull a little more
[1:20:22] tonight, will you?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's not finished yet. So why
[1:20:26] don't we turn to our Bibles and we'll
[1:20:29] turn to the word.
[1:20:36] You know what? if we just removed all of
[1:20:38] our preconceived ideas tonight.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; What if we just set aside everything
[1:20:43] that you've thought this service could
[1:20:45] be
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; and you come and thinking of something
[1:20:47] you've maybe been through many weekends
[1:20:49] and many services, but just just push it
[1:20:51] all aside. What if tonight
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; was like the very first service you've
[1:20:55] ever been in your life?
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; What if you came to it like that?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "What if this would be the very
[1:21:01] first night? I've never been in an
[1:21:03] atmosphere like this." And you you what
[1:21:05] if what if you were coming and someone
[1:21:07] te told you like Philip did Nathaniel
[1:21:09] said Nathaniel he's here the Messiah is
[1:21:12] here. What if what if I like Philip came
[1:21:15] to you tonight and said listen Nathaniel
[1:21:18] you need to come and see the Messiah is
[1:21:20] here. What what if we had that
[1:21:22] conversation and all of you were there
[1:21:24] under the tree and you said really here
[1:21:25] in this hour? Could it really be? Could
[1:21:27] it really be that Jesus has revealed
[1:21:29] himself in this hour again? Could it
[1:21:31] really be that the son of man has come
[1:21:32] and revealed the scriptures and Malachi
[1:21:34] 4 has come and been fulfilled in this
[1:21:36] earth? COULD IT BE?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; AND I'M LIKE, "YES, it's happened. You
[1:21:40] need to come and see."
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; And what if you, like Nathaniel, came to
[1:21:46] Jesus' feet for the very first time.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; And if Philip said, "Come and see." And
[1:21:51] he did. And he said, "Okay, I'm going to
[1:21:52] come." And he there sat for the first
[1:21:56] time.
[1:21:59] Let's approach it like that.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; We're all Nathaniels tonight.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Galatians chapter 5.
[1:22:16] Scripture that you all know quite well,
[1:22:18] I'm sure. Galatians 5.
[1:22:22] Actually, we'll slip over to six. Sorry.
[1:22:26] One chapter over
[1:22:32] and verse seven.
[1:22:40] Be not deceived.
[1:22:45] God is not mocked.
[1:22:49] For whatsoever a man seweth, that shall
[1:22:51] he also reap. For he that sweth to his
[1:22:54] flesh shall of the flesh reap
[1:22:56] corruption, but he that sweth to the
[1:22:58] spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[1:23:00] everlasting. Amen. Let us not be weary
[1:23:04] in welloing, for in due season we shall
[1:23:08] reap
[1:23:10] if we faint not. If we faint not. Let's
[1:23:15] just slip back to Ezekiel
[1:23:17] 37. Brother Tom scared me last night as
[1:23:20] he went to 36 and I my mind was racing.
[1:23:22] I said, "No way. Not to my very same
[1:23:25] chapter."
[1:23:27] Pretty close. Ezekiel 37.
[1:23:40] It's a good sound.
[1:23:44] Imagine
[1:23:49] the moment when someone received their
[1:23:50] first Bible back in the, you know, 1500s
[1:23:53] and such in 1600s and they had a service
[1:23:56] and the very first time they started to
[1:23:57] hear pages.
[1:23:59] What a moment that would have been, huh?
[1:24:01] A preacher must have been like, "Glory,
[1:24:04] they've got the word in their hands."
[1:24:06] Amen. And we have that same one in our
[1:24:08] hands tonight. Amen. Ezekiel 37 verse 9.
[1:24:16] Then said he unto me, "Prophesy unto the
[1:24:18] wind. Prophesy, son of man, and say to
[1:24:21] the wind, thus saith the Lord God, come
[1:24:24] from the four winds, O breath, and
[1:24:26] breathe upon these slain that they may
[1:24:30] live." So I prophesied as he commanded
[1:24:33] me, and the breath came into them, and
[1:24:35] they lived and stood upon their feet an
[1:24:39] exceeding great army. Amen. Let's pray.
[1:24:44] Heavenly Father,
[1:24:46] tonight, Lord, we are so thankful that
[1:24:49] we can be gathered together, Lord, in
[1:24:51] this atmosphere today. And Lord, you
[1:24:54] don't want to take, Lord, a service for
[1:24:56] granted. Lord, we can just come to
[1:24:58] meetings, but Lord, we want to, Lord,
[1:25:00] maybe as Nathaniel, Lord, came with a
[1:25:02] little trepidation. Could it really be
[1:25:04] that Philip's right? Could it really be
[1:25:06] that this is the Messiah? And Lord, as
[1:25:08] he approached that moment, Lord, I'm
[1:25:09] sure there was a little bit of
[1:25:10] excitement. And Lord, just wonder in his
[1:25:13] being, Lord, tonight, but Lord,
[1:25:15] something was calling him because, Lord,
[1:25:17] a seed inside of that predestinated son
[1:25:20] of God was drawing him to the word and
[1:25:22] and flesh in that hour. And Lord, that's
[1:25:24] what's drawn us here tonight is Lord, a
[1:25:26] seed inside of each one of us, Lord,
[1:25:28] that we're desiring with a great desire
[1:25:31] to hear from the very word of God, Lord.
[1:25:34] And that is what Nathaniel heard as you
[1:25:36] spoke to him and you discerned him,
[1:25:38] Lord, and the word was a discerner.
[1:25:40] Would you discern our need tonight,
[1:25:42] Lord, with that same one, Lord, when you
[1:25:44] were there, this the same God, Lord, as
[1:25:46] your scripture says, is the same
[1:25:47] yesterday, today, and forever. You're
[1:25:50] the same as you were in Galilee, as you
[1:25:52] are today. And so would you discern our
[1:25:54] need, meet our every Lord, heart's
[1:25:57] desire, I pray. And we just commit this
[1:25:59] word to you now. In the name of Jesus
[1:26:01] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated tonight.
[1:26:13] All right. You help me preach tonight.
[1:26:14] Okay.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to take just a little
[1:26:19] thought if I could. I'm if I'd title it
[1:26:21] tonight, I'd maybe title it the beyond
[1:26:24] the last breath.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Beyond the last breath. And we'll just
[1:26:27] try and maybe take a couple of these
[1:26:29] scriptures and uh just present bring a
[1:26:31] little thought. We'll just fellowship
[1:26:32] together. Amen. Along the way. And and
[1:26:35] so the scripture there as we read in
[1:26:37] Galatians, it says, "And let us not be
[1:26:39] weary in welloing for in due season we
[1:26:42] shall reap if we faint not." And so
[1:26:46] there's an aspect there that that you
[1:26:47] could get weary and tired. them. And
[1:26:49] then in Ezekiel, we we I want to just
[1:26:51] focus on the the scripture where it
[1:26:53] says, "Breathe and breathe upon these
[1:26:56] slain that they may live." And maybe try
[1:26:58] and bring these two thoughts together.
[1:27:00] And you know, when a when a little baby
[1:27:02] is born,
[1:27:03] a little baby is born, there's there's a
[1:27:05] natural, if I could say, even a natural
[1:27:08] wind that that it gets infused into this
[1:27:12] little baby. All right? And and then
[1:27:14] that little be baby, you know, he comes
[1:27:16] and he's birthed there and he's just
[1:27:18] until something is infused into him,
[1:27:21] he's just what we'd call still. It'd be
[1:27:23] a stillborn baby if nothing if nothing
[1:27:26] came and entered into his lungs. there
[1:27:28] when THAT THAT WIND STARTS to move and
[1:27:30] you know sometimes maybe the doctor has
[1:27:32] to give it a little pat on the rear or
[1:27:34] something like that just to kind of
[1:27:35] startle that little thing and he brings
[1:27:37] that that breath of air into his lungs
[1:27:39] and
[1:27:41] something changes. You know something
[1:27:43] happens there when when the wind not
[1:27:46] just wind COMES IN BUT LIFE COMES IN
[1:27:49] RIGHT COMBINED with that wind or that
[1:27:51] that natural airflow that we just think
[1:27:53] natural but something else is taking
[1:27:55] place a natural a life is now being
[1:27:58] birthed
[1:28:00] and he becomes a living thing well
[1:28:02] breathing thing. He's been living off of
[1:28:04] his mama there for a little while but
[1:28:05] now that wind is now there and that
[1:28:06] spirit is brought into that BODY WHEN
[1:28:08] THAT BREATH STARTS surging through that
[1:28:10] little being. Amen. It's quite an
[1:28:12] incredible moment whoever's been able to
[1:28:14] experience that and to see life be
[1:28:16] infused. And so with this life now,
[1:28:19] mankind has has really been uh you know
[1:28:21] that's been happening for many many uh
[1:28:24] hundreds of years. Babies have been
[1:28:25] born. Man has started to breathe and
[1:28:27] they've started to to to uh to produce I
[1:28:30] could say with that breath that wind
[1:28:33] that has been then that utters from them
[1:28:35] the the first wind of life man is now
[1:28:38] exhaling out through these centuries.
[1:28:41] And with that life it's produced a lot
[1:28:43] of things. That first that that wind man
[1:28:47] has been able to do
[1:28:49] well
[1:28:51] it was with that wind that they say the
[1:28:53] the you know some of the greatest things
[1:28:54] of man was the declaration of human
[1:28:56] rights with with this breath of life man
[1:28:59] has has conquered kingdom after kingdom
[1:29:01] domain after domain. You go through all
[1:29:04] through time you look at Rome and Greece
[1:29:05] and Babylon and the Mongols and all
[1:29:07] these different things. They they they
[1:29:09] they've conquered and have been
[1:29:10] conquered. They they've produced
[1:29:12] incredible things of art with with this
[1:29:14] air, with this with this wind of life
[1:29:16] that has come through man. They've
[1:29:18] produced things like the pyramids and
[1:29:19] such. And they've composed great
[1:29:21] symphonies and orchestrations and and
[1:29:23] and and man has produced
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; as as man has breathed in and breathed
[1:29:32] out. It's produced and it's gone through
[1:29:35] through the centuries of time. It's
[1:29:36] created the steam train, the engine, and
[1:29:38] then it created a plane, and man has
[1:29:40] gone to the moon and done all these
[1:29:42] great feats. And they've they've, you
[1:29:44] know, done things like the four-minute
[1:29:45] mile and even greater maybe now. They've
[1:29:48] climbed Everest, the greatest mountain
[1:29:50] in the world here. And great feats of
[1:29:51] heroism. You know, they've gone to
[1:29:53] warfare. Texas itself is one of the war
[1:29:56] hero. Chris Kyle, mighty sniper, the
[1:29:58] legend.
[1:30:00] Life, the wind has produced these
[1:30:04] things.
[1:30:07] It's with this wind of life,
[1:30:10] the battle of Sanito in 1836, Texas
[1:30:13] became its own place.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Man has harnessed fire.
[1:30:23] It's created the written written word,
[1:30:27] created things like electricity or
[1:30:28] harnessed electricity, split atoms.
[1:30:32] with this life man has taken the breath
[1:30:35] of this first wind and has been doing a
[1:30:37] lot of things
[1:30:40] and with what I could say what have they
[1:30:42] done with it with all its
[1:30:43] accomplishments and all the great things
[1:30:45] that man has done through all the
[1:30:46] centuries you could compile the
[1:30:49] greatness of man and what he's done
[1:30:51] since the first time it's received this
[1:30:53] breath of life but it's still filled
[1:30:56] with incredible
[1:30:58] difficulties
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; through all of the goodness and all the
[1:31:02] greatness that man has done, we still
[1:31:04] live in an incredibly worrisome age and
[1:31:07] a pressurized age. And and an age,
[1:31:09] Brother Brandham says, he says, in this
[1:31:11] great day that we're living, he said,
[1:31:12] there's so much pressure.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; You know, everything seems to be
[1:31:15] pressurized. He said, such a hard hard
[1:31:17] time. He says, "How strange in this age
[1:31:20] of plenty, in an age of progress, in an
[1:31:22] age of abundance, how could there be
[1:31:24] trials?"
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; You know, with all that man has had,
[1:31:26] he's had thousands of years to to to
[1:31:28] breathe in this air and create and and
[1:31:31] accomplish and and improve and and and
[1:31:34] take time TO TO MAKE THE BEST he can.
[1:31:37] And still, we live in an age that's just
[1:31:40] so pressurized, so strangely filled with
[1:31:42] so much difficulty. He said, "With an
[1:31:43] age of plenty and opportunity, when
[1:31:45] everyone has so much, there's so much
[1:31:47] more to be had. With the inventions to
[1:31:49] do our work and so many things that give
[1:31:50] us pleasure, he says, suddenly we find
[1:31:53] mental illness taking such a toll as to
[1:31:56] alarm the nation." He says, "When
[1:31:58] everybody ought to be happy, when really
[1:32:00] nothing to be unhappy about, millions
[1:32:02] are taking sedatives at night, pet pills
[1:32:04] in the morning, rushing to doctors,
[1:32:06] entering institutions, trying to drown
[1:32:08] out unknown fears by alcohol." He said,
[1:32:10] "Yes, this age boasts of tremendous
[1:32:12] stores of worldly goods, but the people
[1:32:14] are less happy than ever. This age
[1:32:16] boasts of spiritual attainments, but the
[1:32:18] people are less sure of themselves than
[1:32:20] ever. This age boasts are they're less
[1:32:23] sure of themselves than ever. The age
[1:32:24] boasts of better moral values, and it's
[1:32:26] more corrupt than any age since the
[1:32:28] flood. It talks about knowledge and
[1:32:30] science, but it's fighting a losing
[1:32:32] battle in all fields. For the human mind
[1:32:34] and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or
[1:32:36] keep a breast with all the changes that
[1:32:38] have come upon the earth. This is a
[1:32:41] leadyian church age. He says, "And in
[1:32:43] one generation, we've gone all the way
[1:32:45] from horse and buggy to space age. And
[1:32:47] we're proud and boastful about it. But
[1:32:49] inside is a dark void cavern that's
[1:32:52] crying out in torment. And without a
[1:32:54] known reason, men's hearts are failing
[1:32:58] for fear. And the world is so darkened
[1:33:00] that this age could well be called the
[1:33:02] age of neurotics.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; This is what man has done
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; with the first breath.
[1:33:13] And believers are not exempt of these
[1:33:16] cares.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Believers are not exempt of the strains
[1:33:19] and these troubling situations that we
[1:33:22] go through. For there's great, it's a
[1:33:24] great wearome time as we read in
[1:33:26] scripture.
[1:33:28] Don't be weary and welloing
[1:33:31] because we go week after week with great
[1:33:33] cares.
[1:33:35] And that's why I was pondering each one
[1:33:37] of you as we were just thinking about
[1:33:38] the weekend of services. What cares and
[1:33:41] burdens that you bear as you'd come to
[1:33:44] these meetings and you you'd walk in
[1:33:46] here and maybe someone has no idea what
[1:33:48] you're going through. Someone has no
[1:33:51] idea the strain that is maybe on your
[1:33:53] mind right even right now.
[1:33:55] Maybe some of you are right at the break
[1:33:57] the point of breaking
[1:34:00] because you carry a burden so heavy.
[1:34:03] This first wind that we've breathed in
[1:34:05] as mankind has not created a lot of
[1:34:06] easiness
[1:34:08] and we carry burdens within our family
[1:34:10] that weigh heavy on our mind or
[1:34:13] our children.
[1:34:16] Maybe we're looking maybe maybe we're
[1:34:18] desiring children.
[1:34:20] Maybe we're desiring our children to be
[1:34:22] married or saved. Or I can tell you
[1:34:25] young parents, it's not easy rearing
[1:34:26] children.
[1:34:28] It gets exhausting and you're trying to
[1:34:31] take care of the children, hold the
[1:34:32] standard of Christ in the home and this
[1:34:34] pressurized age, the world pressing on
[1:34:37] every side and the influences and you
[1:34:39] have teenagers and you're you're waring
[1:34:41] with the world.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; It becomes wearing. Maybe you've gone
[1:34:45] through many decades of life and you
[1:34:47] have disappointments that have heaped up
[1:34:50] over the years and you know one
[1:34:51] disappointment is okay, two is three and
[1:34:53] four and suddenly 10 and suddenly you
[1:34:55] have a life's worth of disappointments.
[1:34:58] You're coming down here tonight. You're
[1:34:59] just Lord, I don't know how I can get
[1:35:02] through another day.
[1:35:07] Maybe some of you have had friends leave
[1:35:08] you, forsake you for this gospel.
[1:35:13] That leaves a wound hurt on your heart.
[1:35:17] Maybe you've had possessions will be
[1:35:19] lost.
[1:35:21] Things you've striven for and you've
[1:35:22] gained and now they're gone.
[1:35:25] Maybe you're sick and your body's
[1:35:26] failing you.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; We have burdens.
[1:35:31] We get weary.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; We get weary.
[1:35:36] Some maybe have financial strains that
[1:35:39] you've carried for many, many years
[1:35:43] and an accumulation of burdens and cares
[1:35:45] and years of
[1:35:47] maybe
[1:35:49] persecution, maybe disassociation, maybe
[1:35:52] from your family. And through time, you
[1:35:54] might even ask yourself recently, Lord,
[1:35:56] does this ever end? Is there ever an end
[1:35:59] to this? Will this trial come to an end?
[1:36:02] Will this burden come? Will the burden
[1:36:04] end? Do I have to carry this? How much
[1:36:06] longer do I need to carry this, Lord?
[1:36:09] And I'd say with natural life,
[1:36:12] yes, there is an end to the first wind.
[1:36:17] For mankind comes when it we come to a
[1:36:20] place where we no longer take in the
[1:36:25] first wind
[1:36:27] and we come to the place where we come
[1:36:29] to our last breath.
[1:36:32] That's just humanity.
[1:36:35] And Ezekiel 37
[1:36:38] starts to paint a picture of this place.
[1:36:42] And the hand of the Lord was upon me and
[1:36:44] carried me into the spirit of the Lord
[1:36:45] and set me down in the midst of the
[1:36:47] valley
[1:36:49] which was full of dry bones and caused
[1:36:52] me to pass by them round about. And
[1:36:54] behold, there there were very many in
[1:36:56] the open valley. And lo, they were very
[1:36:58] dry. This is scripture. And he said unto
[1:37:01] me, "Son, can these bones live?" And
[1:37:04] here, think about it, Ezekiel. And he
[1:37:06] answered, he said, "OH LORD, THOU
[1:37:08] KNOWEST." HE'S LOOKING AT A VALLEY OF
[1:37:10] dry bones. If you could maybe go up to
[1:37:12] those bones and just blew on them, they
[1:37:15] just go into dust. They're they're
[1:37:16] SITTING THERE SO DRY. THEY WERE DEAD,
[1:37:18] DEAD, AND DEAD three times over. And
[1:37:20] he's saying, "Hey, can these bones
[1:37:22] live?"
[1:37:24] Hallelujah.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel saying, "Well,
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; with my natural eye,
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; IT REALLY LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE. WITH MY
[1:37:31] NATURAL EYE, I DON'T I
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; MY FLESH SAYS NO. THEY SURELY COULD CAN
[1:37:37] DRY BONES LIVE AGAIN. IS THAT POSSIBLE
[1:37:39] THAT THESE THINGS THAT THAT COULD JUST
[1:37:40] BLOW INTO THE WIND WHERE THEY'VE THEY'VE
[1:37:42] UTTERED THEIR VERY LAST BREATH
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; can live again?
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; But Lord Lord, thou knowest.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW ALL THINGS. I DON'T KNOW.
[1:37:52] I'M JUST HUMAN. AND I DON'T KNOW
[1:37:53] NOTHING, BUT YOU KNOW ALL THINGS. SO,
[1:37:55] I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE AN ANSWER. I'M
[1:37:57] JUST GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW,
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; TONIGHT I'M JUST SAY, LORD, YOU KNOW MY
[1:38:00] PROBLEM.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW MY SITUATION?
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; DO CAN I GET THROUGH IT?
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, LORD,
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And there were bones. These were
[1:38:10] prior lives.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; This is THESE WERE THIS WAS SOMEBODY
[1:38:14] THAT WAS BREATHING BEFORE. This was
[1:38:16] somebody that that had a life before.
[1:38:18] THEY HAD LIVED. THEY HAD FAMILIES. MAYBE
[1:38:20] THEY had loved ones. They had children
[1:38:21] that we know nothing about.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Don't just look at them at dry bones.
[1:38:24] Let's let's let's remember what they
[1:38:26] were before THEIR LAST BREATH. THEY WERE
[1:38:28] SOMEBODY. THEY DID SOMETHING. THEY LIVED
[1:38:30] FOR LIFE. THEY HAD A WIFE. THEY had a h,
[1:38:32] you know, a husband or whichever they
[1:38:33] could have had. They had accomplishments
[1:38:35] that we know nothing about.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; They did something. THEY HAD SUCCESSES.
[1:38:39] Maybe they had failures. They had
[1:38:41] friends and friendships THAT THEY HAD.
[1:38:42] THEY HAD JOBS. THEY HAD LIFE.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Don't just look at them as dry bones.
[1:38:50] Look at them as somebody like you
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; that lived and breathed AND THAT FIRST
[1:38:54] BREATH WAS JUST IN AND OUT. THAT WIND
[1:38:56] CAME IN AND OUT OF THEM AND THAT natural
[1:38:58] wind had moved through their beer beings
[1:39:00] and everything they had accomplished and
[1:39:02] did
[1:39:03] is totally forgotten
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; cuz you know nothing about it.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; There's nothing there. All of that is
[1:39:10] totally unknown.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; All of their earthly accomplishments and
[1:39:15] achievements.
[1:39:19] What did it mean?
[1:39:22] What did it mean?
[1:39:24] All it became was a valley of dry bones.
[1:39:27] That's it. That's all it was sitting
[1:39:29] there. Corpses that have lost
[1:39:31] everything. And so I wonder all of our
[1:39:33] earthly accomplishments and our
[1:39:34] achievements. Where's it going to be?
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; What's it going to get us really? At the
[1:39:39] end of the day, the first wind gets us
[1:39:42] to a valley of dry bones. It gets us six
[1:39:44] feet under the earth in some little
[1:39:46] coffin somewhere. And eventually WE ALSO
[1:39:48] WOULD BECOME JUST DRY BONES.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; You know, if that's all you're hanging
[1:39:52] on to is what you can do and what I can
[1:39:54] achieve and and what this WITH THIS
[1:39:56] FIRST WIND OF LIFE CAN DO FOR ME AND HOW
[1:39:58] I CAN ACCOMPLISH AND I CAN GAIN ALL THE
[1:40:00] THE MONEY I CAN AND ALL THE SUCCESS I
[1:40:02] CAN. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WILL
[1:40:04] BECOME. IT'S JUST DRY bones
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; and it WILL ALL BE FORGOTTEN.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Totally forgotten.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Your great school and degree will be
[1:40:12] forgotten. All of that, whatever your
[1:40:15] goals, your work progress and awards,
[1:40:16] your sports abilities, how well YOU CAN
[1:40:18] KICK A SOCCER BALL, SWING A BASEBALL
[1:40:20] BAT, WHATEVER IT COULD BE, throw some
[1:40:22] hoops, YOUR HOBBIES, YOUR PASSIONS,
[1:40:24] EVERYTHING YOU PUT TIME INTO THE STUFF
[1:40:26] THAT YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; It's just going to be dust,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; just dry bones. And Ezekiel continued to
[1:40:36] say, "And when I beheld, lo, the senus,
[1:40:38] and the flesh came upon them, and the
[1:40:41] skin covered them above, but there was
[1:40:43] no breath in them. The first wind of
[1:40:46] life was not in them anymore. They were
[1:40:49] still there lifeless. They could have
[1:40:50] all THE THE GOOD FLESH ON THEM. The
[1:40:52] bones could come together. THE MUSCLES
[1:40:54] COULD GET ATTACHED. Everything was
[1:40:56] perfect. They were standing there, the
[1:40:57] epitome of A HUMAN BEING. MUSCLES READY
[1:40:59] TO GO, but still no life.
[1:41:04] And the scripture says, "Then he said
[1:41:06] unto me, prophesy unto the wind.
[1:41:08] Prophesy, son of man, and say to the
[1:41:10] wind, thus sayeth the Lord God, come
[1:41:12] from THE FOUR WINDS, O BREATH, and
[1:41:15] breathe UPON THESE SLAIN THAT THEY may
[1:41:18] live."
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "So I prophesied, and
[1:41:22] he commanded me, and the breath came
[1:41:24] into them, and they lived and stood upon
[1:41:26] their feet, an exceeding great army."
[1:41:31] Then he said unto me, "Son of man, these
[1:41:33] bones are the whole house OF ISRAEL.
[1:41:34] BEHOLD, THEY SAY, we talked about that
[1:41:37] ONE TIME. THEY SAY, WHO SAYS?" SOMEBODY,
[1:41:39] SOMEBODY THAT HAS NO AUTHORITY. THEY SAY
[1:41:41] that the bones ARE DRIED AND OUR HOPE IS
[1:41:44] LOST. WE ARE CUT OFF OF OUR PARTS.
[1:41:46] THEREFORE PROPHESY AND SAY UNTO THEM,
[1:41:48] THUS SAYETH THE LORD GOD, BEHOLD, OH MY
[1:41:51] PEOPLE, I WILL OPEN UP YOUR GRAVES, AND
[1:41:54] CAUSE YOU TO COME OUT OF YOUR GRAVES,
[1:41:56] AND BRING YOU INTO A LAND OF ISRAEL, AND
[1:41:58] YE SHALL KNOW I AM THE LORD, WHEN I HAVE
[1:42:01] OPENED YOUR GRAVES, OH MY PEOPLE, AND
[1:42:03] BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE GRAVES, AND I AND
[1:42:05] SHALL PUT MY SPIRIT IN YOU, and ye SHALL
[1:42:09] LIVE, AND I SHALL PLACE IN YOUR OWN YOU
[1:42:12] in your own land, AND THEY SHALL KNOW
[1:42:13] THAT I AM THE LORD. I HAVE SPOKEN IT AND
[1:42:16] PERFORMED IT, SAITH THE LORD.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS EZEKIEL FINDING OUT? HE WAS
[1:42:22] FINDING OUT THAT GOD KNEW, I CAN BREATHE
[1:42:25] A SECOND WIND INTO THIS BEING. I DON'T
[1:42:27] CARE WHAT YOUR FIRST WIND DID. I DON'T
[1:42:29] CARE WHAT YOUR FLESH CAN DO, BUT I CAN
[1:42:31] RAISE IT UP. I CAN TAKE AWAY ALL THE
[1:42:33] EARTHLY ASPECT AND I CAN INFUSE INTO YOU
[1:42:36] SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AMEN.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel's dry BONES RECEIVED A SECOND
[1:42:44] WIND
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; BEYOND THE LAST BREATH OF HUMANITY.
[1:42:48] BEYOND THE LAST BREATH THAT YOU BREATHE,
[1:42:49] THERE'S ANOTHER BREATH.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A DIFFERENT INFUSION THAT GOD
[1:42:54] WANTS TO POUR INTO YOU. HE DON'T CARE
[1:42:56] ABOUT JUST THE NATURAL. THERE'S A SECOND
[1:42:58] WIND THAT HE NEEDS TO INFUSE.
[1:43:03] HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; The second wind of life WENT BEYOND ALL
[1:43:09] ASPECTS OF THE NATURAL.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND ALONG WITH IT, ALONG WITH THE
[1:43:17] INFUSION OF THE BREATH OF GOD CAME GOD'S
[1:43:21] SPIRIT HIMSELF
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID, "AND I WILL PUT MY
[1:43:25] SPIRIT."
[1:43:27] IT WASN'T JUST NATURAL BREATH AT THE
[1:43:29] WHEN YOU BECAME A BABY, BUT A SECOND
[1:43:31] INFUSION. WHEN A HOLY SPIRIT COMES INTO
[1:43:33] YOU AND COMES INTO ME, BEHIND THAT IS
[1:43:37] HIM.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; The second wind
[1:43:45] MAN STRIVES, FIGHTS. OH MY GOODNESS.
[1:43:49] THEY INFUSE THEMSELVES WITH PILL after
[1:43:50] pill, you know, scoop after SCOOP OF
[1:43:53] SOME PRODUCT TO TRY AND help them be
[1:43:55] healthy. diet,
[1:43:58] concoction after concoction
[1:44:00] to ensure that the first wind that you
[1:44:03] breathed in at birth could last a long
[1:44:06] time
[1:44:09] just to extend it another day or another
[1:44:13] year or another 10 years, whatever. Man
[1:44:16] tries a whole lot.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; But there's a greater win.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; It's the second one.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's more important than
[1:44:26] preserving this first one.
[1:44:32] You know, God gave us oxygen and
[1:44:33] nitrogen, mixed it all together for us
[1:44:35] that we could be drawing it into our
[1:44:37] lungs and you know, breathing that so
[1:44:39] beautifully. But, you know, there's only
[1:44:41] one place.
[1:44:44] There's only one thing we desire is the
[1:44:46] WIND OF GOD
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; TO be infused into you and I. Brother
[1:44:51] Brandon says that of Christ and mystery
[1:44:52] God revealed. says, "Oh, oh, I wish I
[1:44:54] HAD TIME TO GO BACK TO EZEKIEL AND PULL
[1:44:56] OUT THEM DRY BONES AND show you." HE
[1:44:57] SAID, "CAN THESE DRY BONES LIVE AGAIN?"
[1:44:59] HE SAID, "PROPHESY. HOW CAN PROPHECY
[1:45:02] COME?" ONLY THROUGH THE PROPHET.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IT'S THE WORD OF THE LORD."
[1:45:08] HEAR YE DRY BONES, THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:45:11] I CAN TELL YOU THIS EVENING WHAT HAS
[1:45:13] BEEN INFUSED INTO YOU IN THIS HOUR HAS
[1:45:15] BEEN A WIND FROM A PROPHET'S MESSAGE
[1:45:18] THAT HAS COME THIS HOUR TO GET AWAY GET
[1:45:20] YOUR MIND OFF OF THIS NATURAL EARTH THIS
[1:45:23] NATURAL WIND THAT'S COMING INTO MY MOUTH
[1:45:24] RIGHT NOW AND GET YOU PRE GET YOU
[1:45:26] FOCUSED ON ANOTHER WIND ANOTHER INFUSION
[1:45:30] THAT CAN TAKE YOU INTO ETERNITY
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; DON'T GET STUCK ON TERAPIRMA THAT'S WHAT
[1:45:36] THIS MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT IS TO LIFT
[1:45:37] YOUR EYES UP A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SEE
[1:45:39] YOU NEED TO BREATHE ANOTHER BREATH
[1:45:45] THE FIRST wind
[1:45:48] really did did them dry bones no good.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; But when the word of a prophet camel
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; when the word of a prophet came,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; it had power
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; TO RAISE UP THE DRY BONES. NOT JUST PUT
[1:46:03] THEM TOGETHER and make them look like A
[1:46:04] GREAT ARMY BUT IMMOVABLE BUT IT ALSO IS
[1:46:07] ABLE TO INFUSE INTO THEM THE VERY
[1:46:10] ESSENCE AND LIFE OF GOD.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Because the word
[1:46:18] this is restrictive.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:46:23] Because the word has life. Yes,
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; this word has life.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; It ain't just a Bible that you're
[1:46:35] reading for, you know, put in your time.
[1:46:38] Well, I just got to read my Bible
[1:46:39] tonight, you know, just because I got to
[1:46:40] check that box off, you know. No, this
[1:46:42] has life.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; This is the second win that you need.
[1:46:46] This is Christ himself that needs to
[1:46:47] infuse himself into you. You need to you
[1:46:50] need to breathe this one in. Yes.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You know, the Shounomite woman was there
[1:46:54] and her baby HAD DIED AND THE FIRST WIND
[1:46:57] HAD EXITED OUT of her little boy. And
[1:46:59] she knew THAT THERE WAS A PROPHET IN THE
[1:47:01] LAND. SHE KNEW IF I COULD JUST GET TO
[1:47:03] THE WORD OF MY DAY, I KNOW THAT THERE
[1:47:06] COULD BE A SECOND INFUSION INTO MY
[1:47:08] LITTLE BOY'S BODY. AND SO, SHE CAME TO A
[1:47:10] PROPHET AND HE SAID, "I NEED YOU TO COME
[1:47:12] TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT."
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU NEED A YOU NEEDED THE WORD TO
[1:47:15] COME TO YOUR HOUSE TONIGHT. HE SAID, "I
[1:47:17] NEED I KNOW THERE'S A WORD IN THIS HOUR.
[1:47:19] JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[1:47:20] TODAY, AND FOREVER. AND HE'S HERE IN MY
[1:47:22] MIDST TODAY, AND THIS WEEKEND. I NEED
[1:47:24] HIM TO COME TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT BECAUSE
[1:47:26] THE WORD HAS POWER TO RAISE YOUR DEAD
[1:47:29] BOY,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; TO RAISE YOUR DEAD GIRL OR GIRL. HE HAS
[1:47:32] POWER TO RAISE YOUR DEAD HUSBAND OR YOUR
[1:47:34] DEAD WIFE.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; She brought that prophet to her little
[1:47:41] home. He came there and he laid there
[1:47:44] hand to hand, face to face, face, lip to
[1:47:47] lip AND BREATHED. AND THE POWER OF GOD
[1:47:51] IN A PROPHET,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; think about it,
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; infused a second wind of life
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; into that little boy.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Abraham said, "The Lord God lives and
[1:48:06] our your soul never dies. I'm not going
[1:48:08] to leave you." That's what she said to
[1:48:10] Elijah. And he prayed right there till
[1:48:12] Elisha went to the house. Laid his body
[1:48:13] on that dead boy, dead baby. Never
[1:48:16] prayed. Laid his head and hands OVER
[1:48:17] LIKE THIS. PUT HIS LIPS AGAINST it like
[1:48:19] that. AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD THAT WAS IN
[1:48:22] ELISHA COME UPON THE CHILD AND BROUGHT
[1:48:25] IT BACK TO LIFE AGAIN.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; OKAY, I'm going to make it a big jump
[1:48:31] here tonight. You think that spirit of
[1:48:34] God ended there in Elisha in the
[1:48:35] scripture?
[1:48:37] You think the spirit of God ended at
[1:48:39] William Brandon in 1965? Did the spirit
[1:48:42] of God stop working in his people and
[1:48:45] through HIS PEOPLE? THEN WHO'S HERE
[1:48:47] TONIGHT?
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; WHO'S HERE TONIGHT THAT IS LIVING AND
[1:48:51] BREATHING THROUGH A BODY OF PEOPLE?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Spirit. AND IF GOD
[1:48:58] COULD BREATHE THROUGH A PROPHET LIKE
[1:48:59] THAT, IF I COULD TAKE THE WORDS BUTTER
[1:49:01] BRENNHAM SAID, "PUT THESE WORDS ON YOUR
[1:49:02] LIPS. PUT THIS PRAYER ON YOUR LIPS."
[1:49:04] WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S LIFE WITH THIS
[1:49:06] WORD.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Without the breath of life, a body is
[1:49:12] dead as dead can be. We know it. There's
[1:49:15] nothing there.
[1:49:16] You can have all the characteristics of
[1:49:18] this body, but without breath,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; it's dead.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; We know this. It could have a perfect
[1:49:24] nose. IT COULD HAVE PERFECT EYES. It
[1:49:26] could BE THE PERFECT SPECIMEN OF
[1:49:28] HUMANITY. MUSCLES RIPPLING AND BEAUTY
[1:49:30] AND ALL OF THAT. BUT WITHOUT BREATH,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; it's nothing. Without
[1:49:37] breath, it's a corpse. It's a cadaavver.
[1:49:40] It's a shell. No one home.
[1:49:47] That is the same very same for the
[1:49:50] spiritual body that is walking day in
[1:49:53] and day out with the Holy Spirit living
[1:49:56] inside. You're just a spiritual walking
[1:49:59] cadaavver
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; and need a second wind. Hallelujah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Not to put it so graphic, but that's as
[1:50:08] basic as it can get
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; because you'll just end up dry bones.
[1:50:13] But if the second wind of God, a Holy
[1:50:16] Spirit infusion can come. But Abraham
[1:50:19] says, "What we need, the church needs is
[1:50:21] not a facelift or a bunch of new
[1:50:23] members, but revive that what we've got
[1:50:26] and fill with the Holy Ghost AND SET OUT
[1:50:28] TO FIGHT THE ENEMY TO PRAY FOR THE SICK,
[1:50:30] HEAL THE SICK, CAST OUT DEVILS. FREELY
[1:50:33] YOU RECEIVE, FREELY GIVE. These signs
[1:50:35] shall follow them THAT BELIEVE CHRIST
[1:50:36] PUT INTO THE HAND OF THE MAN OF MAN."
[1:50:38] THE STRONGEST WEAPON THAT WAS EVER PUT
[1:50:41] INTO THE HUMAN BEING WAS THE BAPTISM OF
[1:50:44] THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT IN THERE. HE
[1:50:49] SAYS, HE SAYS, AND THEN FIGHT WITH
[1:50:51] WHAT'S IN YOU UNTIL DEATH SET YOU FREE.
[1:50:53] I SAY TONIGHT, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A
[1:50:55] SECOND WIND, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOLY
[1:50:57] SPIRIT BREATHING THROUGH YOU, TONIGHT IS
[1:51:00] YOUR NIGHT FOR THE BREATH OF GOD TO COME
[1:51:03] AND INFUSE YOU. HE SAID, "WELL, I GAVE
[1:51:05] MY HEART TO HIM." AND HE'S WANTING TO
[1:51:07] THEN PUT HIS SPIRIT IN YOU.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Don't stop AT JUST GIVING THE HEART.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T STOP AT JUST GIVING THE HEART, BUT
[1:51:14] SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO BREATHE IN.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; I NEED A HOLY GHOST FILLING TONIGHT."
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; I'm going to define for you a second
[1:51:24] wind.
[1:51:26] Anybody here is a runner? Who's Anybody
[1:51:29] run?
[1:51:31] Tough crowd. That little guy back there.
[1:51:34] Nobody's a runner in here.
[1:51:38] Hey, I like it.
[1:51:41] For the one or so runners that are in
[1:51:43] this building,
[1:51:45] they'll understand what I'm saying. But
[1:51:47] the rest of us, it's all new news here.
[1:51:52] When you run to keep the first wind
[1:51:55] going as long as you can,
[1:51:57] a runner can experience this kind of
[1:52:00] exhilarating moment where they become
[1:52:03] exhausted
[1:52:04] and they they're coming to really the
[1:52:06] end of their their ability and they get
[1:52:08] what they call a second wind. IT'S LIKE
[1:52:10] THIS THIS RESURGING OF ENERGY that that
[1:52:13] fills them and they are able to keep
[1:52:15] going. It's kind of a you know it's a
[1:52:17] bit of a interesting phenomenon and
[1:52:18] everybody has some wonderings of you
[1:52:20] know why or or how does it happen but
[1:52:23] you know so they they it's this
[1:52:24] temporary relief of breathlessness and
[1:52:27] fatigue or in sleep you know you can
[1:52:28] combat the drowsiness you kind of wake
[1:52:30] up you're like wow yeah whoever's done
[1:52:32] that so there we go there we go you're
[1:52:36] not runners but you're late nighters
[1:52:39] okay I see so you got no problem if I
[1:52:42] STOP MY CLOCK and we just you know keep
[1:52:44] going because you know what I now.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You get that little second wind,
[1:52:47] YOU'RE LIKE, "HEY, I'M GOOD FOR A LONG
[1:52:49] HAUL. I'M GOING TO BE LIKE LISTENING TO
[1:52:51] PAUL WHO WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE NIGHT
[1:52:53] PREACHING AND THE POOR FELLOW THAT
[1:52:55] DIDN'T GET A SECOND WIND FELL OUT OF THE
[1:52:56] WINDOW OR SOMETHING." That's right.
[1:52:58] Exactly. That's We don't have no windows
[1:53:00] here, so we're good. BUT BUT THAT'S WHAT
[1:53:01] THE SECOND WIND IS. IT'S A CONFUSION.
[1:53:05] You're like, "I'm ready for the day
[1:53:06] again." But, you know, everybody tries
[1:53:08] to figure out why. scientists they
[1:53:11] reason with series you know they just
[1:53:12] think that well it's just some
[1:53:14] endorphins that kick into the brain and
[1:53:15] it makes you feel good and and you know
[1:53:17] there's some you know you ignore the
[1:53:18] pain kind of thing but others others
[1:53:21] kind of theorize that well some take the
[1:53:23] fact that maybe it's it happens in
[1:53:25] professionals because you know they've
[1:53:27] trained and they can push through and
[1:53:28] and things like that or or some they
[1:53:30] just think it's totally psychological
[1:53:32] you know that it is just you know the
[1:53:33] boost comes when you realize you're over
[1:53:34] halfway and suddenly you know you're
[1:53:37] going on the other side of the hill and
[1:53:38] it's like you get a real resurgence But
[1:53:40] you know, whatever it is, it happens. I
[1:53:43] don't really care what the reason is.
[1:53:45] There's something called the second
[1:53:47] wind. It comes and and people feel this
[1:53:49] this this infusion of energy and and and
[1:53:52] and they they feel like they can go all
[1:53:54] the way. But if I COULD SAY THE SECOND
[1:53:57] WIND IN IN THIS HOUR ON A SPIRITUAL
[1:53:59] ASPECT IS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHICH BRINGS
[1:54:02] POWER FOR YOU TO KEEP GOING.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That second if it hasn't come AND
[1:54:07] FILLED YOU, YOU'RE really just GOOD. AS
[1:54:08] I SAID, THEM DRY BONES OR YOU KNOW,
[1:54:10] SATAN WANT NO scared of no dry bones.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Satan ain't scared
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; of just somebody that's walking in and
[1:54:19] out of church just as a message young
[1:54:21] ruler.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; He he he don't scared of nothing.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU THOSE BONES BECAME INFUSED
[1:54:28] WITH LIFE
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; AND RECEIVED A SECOND WIND FROM A
[1:54:32] PROPHET'S WORD, NOW WE HAD A PROBLEM.
[1:54:34] THE SOLDIERS CAME TO BATTLE. ARMOR
[1:54:36] STARTED BEATING, GLEAMING, SWORDS CAME
[1:54:38] OUT, SHIELDS CAME OUT. IT SAID, "ALL
[1:54:40] RIGHT, IT'S READY FOR BATTLE TIME."
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; WHOA.
[1:54:44] Just hold your horses there. And that's
[1:54:46] what happens when the you become from
[1:54:48] dry bones to living bones because the
[1:54:50] Holy Spirit has come and infused you.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Satan says, "Wait a second. I got a
[1:54:55] problem here."
[1:54:57] Them November meetings really caused a
[1:54:58] stir was in hell BECAUSE SOMEBODY WALKED
[1:55:01] IN DRY BONES AND THEY RECEIVED SOME SORT
[1:55:03] OF BREATH, SOME SORT OF INFUSION, SOME
[1:55:06] SORT OF SECOND WIND AND I GOT AN ISSUE
[1:55:08] HERE IN HELL. I GOT TO DISPATCH A LEGION
[1:55:10] OF DEMONS TO THAT PERSON THERE BECAUSE
[1:55:12] OF WHERE I COULD JUST IGNORE THEM. NOW I
[1:55:14] CANNOT.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Something
[1:55:23] brought Job's strength when it seemed
[1:55:26] hopeless.
[1:55:28] It wasn't Job's abilities. Job didn't do
[1:55:30] nothing. Something brought Abraham
[1:55:32] through the dark hour of trial when he
[1:55:35] was waiting for a promise.
[1:55:38] Something moved the martyrs through
[1:55:39] incredible tribulation.
[1:55:41] SOMETHING. THEY HAD SOMETHING DIFFERENT
[1:55:44] THAT WAS BEYOND JUST THIS NATURAL BREATH
[1:55:46] THAT WAS BEYOND JUST WHAT I'M BREATHING
[1:55:47] RIGHT NOW THAT COULD GET THEM through
[1:55:50] incredible difficulty.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Abraham that was there for 25 years, you
[1:55:54] don't think that was a difficult time.
[1:55:56] You don't think that at year 17, DAY
[1:55:59] 275, HOUR 12, MINUTE 39, that he was
[1:56:03] just there under the weight OF THE
[1:56:05] BURDEN OF GOD. DID YOU NOT HEAR YOUR
[1:56:07] PROMISE? I STILL BELIEVE.
[1:56:11] WHAT WAS IT? He was infused with
[1:56:13] something more
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; than just this breath I'm breathing
[1:56:15] right now.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; But Abraham says, "And I looked." He
[1:56:21] said, "I was looking at all the trees
[1:56:22] and all of that." He says, "Well, that
[1:56:24] wind's blowing. What's that wind blowing
[1:56:25] for? What makes the trees act like
[1:56:27] that?" And he said, "And he said to me,
[1:56:31] capital H, those trees represent the
[1:56:33] churches of this day, great to spires."
[1:56:35] And he said, "We, yes, we were once
[1:56:37] great churches, but they haven't got no
[1:56:39] life in them." He says, "What the
[1:56:41] pulmerorm left and the caterpillar is
[1:56:42] eaten, the caterpillar left, the
[1:56:44] cankerorm eating." And I thought, "Well,
[1:56:46] what's this? What does this wind mean?"
[1:56:49] He said, "That's the Holy Spirit that
[1:56:52] come on Pentecost come like a mighty
[1:56:55] rushing wind." I SAID, "LORD, WELL, WHAT
[1:56:58] DO YOU SEND THE WIND FOR?" HE SAID, "YOU
[1:57:00] REMEMBER JOEL SAID, I WILL RESTORE UNTO
[1:57:04] YOU." SOMEBODY TONIGHT MIGHT FEEL LIKE,
[1:57:06] WELL, I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M A LITTLE BIT
[1:57:07] DRY. I'M A LITTLE BIT LIKE A BIG STICK,
[1:57:09] BUT I CAN RESTORE. THERE'S ANOTHER WIND
[1:57:11] THAT CAN RESTORE. IT'S CALLED THE HOLY
[1:57:13] SPIRIT THAT IS HERE TONIGHT TO SAY, I'M
[1:57:16] HERE TO BLOW THROUGH THIS LITTLE
[1:57:17] SANCTUARY. I'M HERE TO BREEZE THROUGH
[1:57:19] HERE LIKE A RUSHING WIND AND INFUSE. You
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; remember, you're Nathaniel
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; and you're hearing this for the first
[1:57:31] time.
[1:57:34] You're not hearing this like a believer
[1:57:36] that's been here for 50 years. You're
[1:57:38] hearing this for the first time saying,
[1:57:40] "Lord, I need this tree. I need this
[1:57:44] vessel to be infused."
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time they shake, they
[1:57:49] dig down a little deeper and get a
[1:57:51] better hold.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; They go deeper. The wind shakes, makes
[1:57:53] the tree go down deeper and makes a
[1:57:55] better tree." He said, "That's what we
[1:57:56] need tonight is an old-fashioned
[1:57:58] God-scent Holy Ghost meeting. That's
[1:58:00] what Switzerland needs, WHAT GERMANY
[1:58:02] NEEDS. THAT'S WHAT CANADA NEEDS. That's
[1:58:04] what America needs. He said, "That's the
[1:58:06] great world. What the great WORLD NEEDS.
[1:58:08] AND GOD'S GOT HIS PEOPLE. HIS SPIRIT IS
[1:58:10] HERE. JUST TURN LOOSE AND LET IT BE
[1:58:12] FLEXIBLE AND THE HOLY GHOST WILL SHOW
[1:58:14] YOU." AMEN. I THOUGHT, "OH, GOD,
[1:58:17] TONIGHT, COULD THERE NOT BE A MOVING OF
[1:58:19] YOUR HOLY SPIRIT WHERE WE ARE JUST
[1:58:21] DESIRING WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S IN ME TO
[1:58:23] SEE YOU MOVE?"
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Is that just my desire?
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Is that just my desire?
[1:58:29] Oh God, I pray not. You know, there was
[1:58:32] a man
[1:58:38] was a deep, deep, deep sea diver. We're
[1:58:40] talking 300 plus feet and more.
[1:58:43] And through a course of situations, he
[1:58:45] got cut off from his air at about 300
[1:58:46] something feet down.
[1:58:50] And he had a reserve of 10 minutes after
[1:58:53] his lines got cut.
[1:58:57] and his butt diving partner
[1:59:02] was getting pulled. I won't go over the
[1:59:04] details, but his they were getting
[1:59:06] pulled and that's why the lines got cut.
[1:59:07] Well, the one because it gotten snagged
[1:59:09] and one got pulled away. And as he was
[1:59:11] pulling away there, as their comms were
[1:59:13] going to almost stop working, he said,
[1:59:15] "Get to the top of this underwater uh
[1:59:18] structure and I'll come I'll come back."
[1:59:21] And anyways,
[1:59:23] he gets to the top of the structure with
[1:59:26] minutes to spare on his tank and the air
[1:59:28] goes out
[1:59:31] and he had cluck clicked himself in. And
[1:59:35] he's sitting there lying there on the
[1:59:38] 300 feet underwater
[1:59:40] and his air ceases.
[1:59:48] Minute by minute goes by and they work
[1:59:51] to try and get help back to him.
[2:00:00] And 29 plus minutes later
[2:00:03] they get him into
[2:00:05] the capsule where they can get back to
[2:00:07] air
[2:00:09] and he's dead.
[2:00:11] He has breathed his last breath.
[2:00:15] And they try CPR. They try
[2:00:18] to give them breath
[2:00:23] and they give up and they sit in there
[2:00:26] 300 ft down in this capsule thing that
[2:00:29] and they just
[2:00:32] broken
[2:00:34] that and they they got there
[2:00:38] but way too late.
[2:00:43] And as they're talking to each other,
[2:00:47] they hear him speak.
[2:00:50] They're like,
[2:00:54] they they can't reconcile how this man
[2:00:59] is living again
[2:01:02] after almost 30 minutes with zero
[2:01:06] oxygen,
[2:01:10] no damage. He he he he he it's like he
[2:01:13] wakes up. He doesn't have brain damage.
[2:01:17] He's he he he didn't have no idea. You
[2:01:19] know what what's just happened? They get
[2:01:21] him upstairs and it's like life went on
[2:01:25] after almost 30 minutes with zero air.
[2:01:30] And I thought about that
[2:01:35] somebody could be 29 years dead.
[2:01:40] You could sit in church for 30 years
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; and your pastor could come and he could
[2:01:49] preach a word and he he might just have
[2:01:51] a broken heart. He's maybe looked over
[2:01:53] the audience over year after year after
[2:01:55] year, minister after ministers come
[2:01:57] through and it's like it's like there's
[2:02:01] it's no hope.
[2:02:03] There's anything nothing can waken them.
[2:02:05] Nothing can shake them. It's is there
[2:02:07] anything year 2 year 5 year 10 minute 15
[2:02:11] minute 10 year 15 year 28 year 29 year
[2:02:17] and suddenly
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; something that they can't explain
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; something that we
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; I can it's called my god
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; AT YEAR 29 SOMEBODY'S SITTING IN CHURCH
[2:02:33] SOME HUSBAND JUST DECIDES YOU KNOW WHAT
[2:02:34] MAYBE I'M GOING TO GO TO CHURCH AFTER 29
[2:02:36] 29 YEARS OF PRAYING FROM A LITTLE MOMMY,
[2:02:37] A LITTLE WIFE THAT'S COME TO CHURCH YEAR
[2:02:39] AFTER YEAR AND SUDDENLY SOMETHING
[2:02:41] HAPPENS. IT'S CALLED A WIND GOES
[2:02:43] THROUGH. A SECOND WIND AFTER THE LAST
[2:02:46] BREATH HAS BEEN BREATHED AND ALL HOPE
[2:02:48] HAS BEEN GONE. BUT GOD COMES THROUGH
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "I'M NOT DONE YET. I'M HERE TO
[2:02:54] GIVE A MIRACLE. I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU
[2:02:56] THAT I STILL LIVE. THAT I CAN BREATHE
[2:02:58] INTO THIS BODY OF MINE AND BRING THEM
[2:03:00] BACK TO LIFE." DON'T YOU DARE SIT THERE
[2:03:03] AND LOOK AT SOMEBODY AND SAY, "OH,
[2:03:04] THEY'RE PAST HOPE." THEY'RE NEVER PAST
[2:03:06] HOPE. BECAUSE MY GOD CAN INFUSE INTO
[2:03:10] THEM HIS VERY ESSENCE.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND WHEN GOD DOES THAT,
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; NEVER THE SAME AGAIN. I CAN TELL YOU
[2:03:18] THERE'S NO DEFECTS. THERE'S NO BRAIN
[2:03:20] ISSUES. THERE'S NO PAST LIFE ISSUES. ALL
[2:03:23] THE PAST IS WIPED AWAY. ALL THE HURT AND
[2:03:25] SORROW IS GONE BECAUSE HE CAME IN AND
[2:03:28] BREATHED INTO YOU.
[2:03:32] HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; DON'T RELY ON YOUR FIRST HAIR. IT'S
[2:03:35] FILLED WITH HURT. IT'S FILLED WITH
[2:03:37] WORRY. IT'S FILLED WITH SHAME. IT'S
[2:03:39] FILLED WITH CONDEMNATION. BUT GET THE
[2:03:41] SECOND BREATH.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL GONE.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; ALL TEARS ARE WIPED AWAY.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, ALL THINGS BECOME NEW.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:59] The first win
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; brought a cursing Peter.
[2:04:06] The first wind brought a tax collecting
[2:04:09] Matthew that the Jews hated.
[2:04:15] The first win
[2:04:17] brought a Saul that could stand there
[2:04:21] and watch the people stone Stephen.
[2:04:25] Just give me your coats. You need to
[2:04:28] loosen up. I need to make a good throw.
[2:04:31] I'll hold the coats for you. Take him
[2:04:33] out. That's what the first one produced.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; This is just the first.
[2:04:42] I'm going to release my vengeance upon
[2:04:44] these people they call Christians.
[2:04:47] That's what the first one produced.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; And when the day of Pentecost was fully
[2:04:53] come, they were all with one accord in
[2:04:56] one place. And suddenly there came a
[2:04:58] sound from heaven as a rushing mighty
[2:05:02] wind. AND IT FILLED THE HOUSE WHERE THEY
[2:05:05] WERE SITTING. AND THERE APPEARED UNTO
[2:05:06] THEM CLOVEN TONGUES LIKE AS OF FIRE, AND
[2:05:09] IT SAT UPON EACH OF THEM. AND THEY WERE
[2:05:12] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND BEGAN TO
[2:05:15] SPEAK WITH OTHER TONGUES AS THE SPIRIT
[2:05:17] GAVE THEM UTTERANCE. THAT WAS A SECOND
[2:05:19] WIND THAT TOOK A CURSING PETER AND A TAX
[2:05:22] COLLECTING MATTHEW AND A WRETCHED SAUL
[2:05:25] AND COULD CHANGE THEM.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR HISTORY IS. I
[2:05:29] DON'T CARE WHAT ISSUE YOU GOT. I DON'T
[2:05:31] CARE HOW BAD YOU ARE. I DON'T CARE YOUR
[2:05:33] PAST HISTORY. THIS SECOND WIND OF GOD
[2:05:36] CAN BREATHE THROUGH YOU AND CHANGE YOU
[2:05:38] INTO A PETER THAT COULD STEP OUT AND
[2:05:41] SAY, "COME ON, HELL. HERE I COME."
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE SECOND ONE, YOUNG PEOPLE THAT
[2:05:48] YOU NEED TONIGHT. IF YOU GAVE YOUR
[2:05:50] HEART, HE'S HERE TO FILL YOU.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; But says that's the purpose of the Holy
[2:05:56] Ghost. THAT'S WHAT GOD SENT THE HOLY
[2:05:58] GHOST FOR. THE HOLY GHOST COME TO GIVE
[2:06:00] YOU POWER.
[2:06:02] AMEN.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; He says, I got some more scriptures
[2:06:07] here. Just a minute. The Holy GHOST COME
[2:06:09] TO GIVE YOU POWER. HE GIVES YOU POWER.
[2:06:11] HE SAID, POWER IN PRAYER.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; He says a little person that's lived a
[2:06:18] good life. Always defeated. Oh, sure. I
[2:06:21] love the Lord, Brother Brandon, but
[2:06:22] you're always defeated. THEY NEVER GET A
[2:06:24] PRAYER ANSWERED. BUT YOU FILL THAT
[2:06:25] LITTLE WOMAN WITH THE HOLY GHOST ONE
[2:06:28] TIME AND WATCH WHAT TAKES PLACE.
[2:06:31] I'LL TELL YOU WHAT TAKES PLACE. SATAN
[2:06:33] KINGDOM GOES ON RED ALERT. LIGHTS START
[2:06:36] FLASHING. SIRENS START GOING BECAUSE A
[2:06:38] LITTLE SISTER GETS ON HER KNEES AFTER
[2:06:41] BEING FILLED WITH ANOTHER WIND OF GOD
[2:06:43] THROUGH HER AND SAYING, "OH GOD, I HAVE
[2:06:46] THIS NEED right here."
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Take that little man so
[2:06:53] cowardly. The boss kick him all over the
[2:06:55] place. WAIT A MINUTE HERE. NOW SOMETHING
[2:06:57] CHANGES. He's got the Holy Ghost." He
[2:07:00] says it gives you power in speech.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; You're going to work maybe barely even
[2:07:08] saying a word about what you who you
[2:07:11] are. People kind of just kick you
[2:07:12] around, whatever. But this Holy Ghost
[2:07:14] wind
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; walk through work with your shoulders
[2:07:18] back.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; What happened to this one? I'll tell you
[2:07:22] what happened. The essence of Almighty
[2:07:24] God breathed into him.
[2:07:31] He said, "God was over us with Moses in
[2:07:34] the burning bush. He fed us with mana.
[2:07:36] He walked with us three years. But now
[2:07:38] he's in me. It's not he me that
[2:07:41] speaketh. It's him. I know who he is and
[2:07:43] I know who I am. I ain't no more. He is.
[2:07:59] Ephesians 3.
[2:08:06] Oh, I pray tonight
[2:08:09] that it's just not just a service,
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; not just quotes and scriptures,
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; not just a preacher preaching his heart
[2:08:17] out, but tonight that you said, "Lord, I
[2:08:20] I need that. I need that that different.
[2:08:23] I don't need my spirit. I need your
[2:08:25] spirit.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; I need your life living inside of me. I
[2:08:29] need these bones that were dry. THAT'S
[2:08:32] FEEL SO DRY HERE TONIGHT. I NEED
[2:08:34] SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I NEED YOU TO COME
[2:08:36] IN. I GOT WARFARE AHEAD OF ME. I GOT TO
[2:08:39] GO INTO THE THIS LAND. I NEED TO I I
[2:08:41] need my skin MY MY SU MY FLESH NOT JUST
[2:08:44] TO TO PRODUCE SOMETHING and on my own it
[2:08:47] won't happen.
[2:08:50] Wherefore I desire that ye faint not,
[2:08:52] Paul's saying, at my tribulations, for
[2:08:55] you, which is your glory, for this cause
[2:08:57] I bow my knees unto the father of our
[2:08:59] Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:09:01] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[2:09:03] earth is named, that he would grant you
[2:09:05] according to the riches of his glory TO
[2:09:06] BE STRENGTHENED WITH MIGHT BY HIS SPIRIT
[2:09:09] IN the inner man.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what you need to be
[2:09:14] strengthened in my with might BY HIS
[2:09:16] SPIRIT THAT CHRIST MAY dwell in your
[2:09:18] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[2:09:21] grounded in love may be able to
[2:09:23] comprehend with all saints what is the
[2:09:25] breadth AND LENGTH AND DEPTH AND HEIGHT
[2:09:26] AND TO KNOW THE LOVE OF CHRIST WHICH
[2:09:28] PASSES KNOWLEDGE THAT YE MIGHT BE FILLED
[2:09:30] WITH THE all the fullness of God. Now
[2:09:33] unto him that's able to DO EXCEEDINGLY
[2:09:35] ABUNDANTLY above all that we should ask
[2:09:38] or think according to the power that
[2:09:41] workketh in us.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; And this wind now blew
[2:09:53] through Pentecost.
[2:09:55] Peter, James, John,
[2:09:57] Paul and all these ones started to march
[2:09:59] through.
[2:10:02] Butter Brandon says
[2:10:05] when he saw that little bride in
[2:10:07] preview, we can look back to the
[2:10:08] Pentecost first Pentecost church of Acts
[2:10:11] 2 and we can see all the mighty works it
[2:10:13] did as they went by gate beautiful and
[2:10:15] silver and gold have we none but such as
[2:10:17] we have rise UP AND WALK AND THEY THEY
[2:10:19] WERE THEY were able to we see miracle
[2:10:21] after miracle through THIS SCRIPTURE AND
[2:10:23] WOW WE SAY WHAT AN INFUSION OF GOD. WE
[2:10:25] COULD SEE THE MOVING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[2:10:27] ALL THROUGH THE CHURCH. AND brother
[2:10:29] Brandomy says, "Here is a preview of the
[2:10:31] bride." And she come by and I noticed
[2:10:33] her the way she was. Oh, very lovely and
[2:10:35] pretty young. And she was walking just
[2:10:38] in step as she could, not a march, just
[2:10:41] in stride of a woman, how to walk
[2:10:43] gracefully and leike. And that's the way
[2:10:45] she was walking, coming to my left side
[2:10:47] as she went out of my sight.
[2:10:50] and he saw the first church, if I could
[2:10:53] say the first wind
[2:10:56] go through.
[2:10:59] But a message came at the end time
[2:11:02] at the end of ages. If I could say
[2:11:05] another breath of God was going to be
[2:11:08] breathed. And brother Bram says, "THEN
[2:11:09] HE SAID, THE BRIDE WILL COME INTO
[2:11:11] PREVIEW AGAIN." And here the bride CAME
[2:11:14] BEHIND HER, THE VERY SAME LOOKING BRIDE
[2:11:16] THAT PASSED AT THE BEGINNING. THEN MY
[2:11:18] HEART JUMPED FOR JOY TO KNOW THAT THERE
[2:11:19] WILL BE A BRIDE AND SHE'LL BE MADE IN
[2:11:21] THE SAME THING AND CLOTHED IN THE SAME
[2:11:23] THING THAT WAS AT THE BEGINNING. SHE IS
[2:11:25] TO BE CALLED. AND I KNOW THAT IS THE
[2:11:27] TRUTH. IT'S THE SAME WIND THAT BLEW AT
[2:11:30] PENTECOST IN ACTS 2 THAT WAS BREATHING
[2:11:32] THROUGH THAT INFUSED THEM WITH POWER IS
[2:11:34] BREATHING THROUGH THIS AGE AGAIN. THAT'S
[2:11:36] WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS ABOUT. IT'S GOD
[2:11:38] BREATHING A SECOND INFUSION OF THE SAME
[2:11:40] SPIRIT OF GOD INTO A BRIDE
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; TO BRING HER through preview.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Say it's the same.
[2:11:47] the first and the last
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; the same breath of God
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; rushing through this little group
[2:12:01] and those that have,
[2:12:05] you know, if you've ever
[2:12:09] experience a second wind,
[2:12:13] it's impossible as a runner
[2:12:19] or anybody in some sort of physical
[2:12:20] activity.
[2:12:22] If I was walking a marathon and I walked
[2:12:26] it, I would never experience a second
[2:12:30] wind.
[2:12:31] Never. I'd never know what that even
[2:12:34] means.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; If I joged a little bit,
[2:12:39] I got tired. Got to walk this next K
[2:12:42] next mile. I jog a little bit. Oh boy,
[2:12:45] got a heart rate of 130. I'm going to
[2:12:47] walk again. I wouldn't even know what
[2:12:50] that mean. A runner could be, man, have
[2:12:52] you hit it? Have you hit your second win
[2:12:54] yet? Second what? What's that mean? I
[2:12:57] don't know. See you, bud. And off he
[2:12:58] goes. You know, it just be a blur.
[2:13:01] Because he he he tapped into something.
[2:13:02] I'll tell you what he tapped into. It's
[2:13:04] because he was giving everything.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Because he was exerting all. HE WAS
[2:13:09] GIVING EVERYTHING HE HAD TO GET TO THE
[2:13:12] PLACE WHERE HE CROSSED OVER TO WHERE HE
[2:13:14] FEEL AN INFUSION OF ANOTHER'S ENERGY
[2:13:17] THAT CAME FROM DEEP WITHIN. AND I TELL
[2:13:19] YOU, THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RECORD
[2:13:21] THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE WHERE A BURST
[2:13:23] OF ENERGY CAME WHEN YOU WEREN'T GIVING
[2:13:25] EVERYTHING.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; BEFORE A SECOND WIND COULD COME, BEFORE
[2:13:30] AN INFUSION OF STRENGTH COULD COME, YOU
[2:13:32] GOT TO PUT OUTPUT.
[2:13:38] I look at butter brand his schedule
[2:13:39] sometimes. I look down all the way
[2:13:41] through and it's like meeting meeting
[2:13:43] and then he talks about himself at the
[2:13:45] pulpit and laying here falling asleep in
[2:13:47] the early years and day after day
[2:13:49] through prayer lines. I'M LIKE, "OH GOD,
[2:13:52] what have I done? I've done nothing."
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; This was a PROPHET THAT WAS PUTTING OUT
[2:13:57] EVERYTHING. HE WAS DOING EVERYTHING HE
[2:13:59] COULD. I'M NO PROPHET. WE'RE NO PROPHET.
[2:14:01] BUT WE CAN PUT OUT EVERYTHING.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GIVE OUR ALL. BUT WE GOT TO
[2:14:04] GIVE OVER AND GIVE EVERYTHING TO HIM.
[2:14:06] BECAUSE WHEN WE GIVE EVERYTHING
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; THAN A RUNNER
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; FEELS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU START GIVING YOUR ALL, WHEN YOU
[2:14:14] SURRENDER EVERYTHING, WHEN YOU LAY IT
[2:14:16] DOWN AT AN ALTAR, THEN GOD CAN COME
[2:14:18] THROUGH YOU AND SAY, "ALL RIGHT, I'LL
[2:14:20] INFUSE YOU."
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; You want to hold back 80%. You want to
[2:14:26] hold back 10%. You ain't going to get
[2:14:28] there. You want to hold back just EVEN
[2:14:29] 1%. YOU GOT TO GIVE 100%. YOU'RE AT THE
[2:14:33] YOU'RE AT THE PLACE WHERE YOU'RE GOING
[2:14:34] TO FALL DOWN. I DON'T THINK I CAN GO
[2:14:36] ANYMORE IN THIS RACE. AND THEN SOMETHING
[2:14:38] STARTS TO CHANGE. LIKE I THINK I can do
[2:14:40] this. I THINK I GOT IT. I'M READY. WHY?
[2:14:43] BECAUSE YOU GAVE ALL.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; I know some of you here have been here a
[2:14:53] long time. You've been here a long time.
[2:14:57] You've labored many years.
[2:15:00] You have given of your sustenance.
[2:15:02] You've supported the work of God. You've
[2:15:05] labored day in and day out, decade in
[2:15:06] and decade out. You've put out and you
[2:15:11] get down weary.
[2:15:14] Daniel says, "And the 10 horns out of
[2:15:16] this kingdom and or 10 kings, and they
[2:15:17] shall rise, and another shall rise after
[2:15:19] them, and he shall be diverse from from
[2:15:21] the first, and he shall subdue three
[2:15:22] kings, and he shall speak great words
[2:15:25] against the most high, and shall wear
[2:15:28] out the saints of the most high."
[2:15:33] So, it's no surprise that you that have
[2:15:36] toiled a long time and you've labored,
[2:15:38] oh my goodness, you could have been just
[2:15:39] in this army for a year and you're
[2:15:40] already wore out. Why? Because Satan is
[2:15:44] there to wear you out. Scripture. And
[2:15:48] they SHALL WEAR OUT THE SAINTS OF THE
[2:15:51] MOST HIGH. THE THE THE meaning of that
[2:15:54] IS TO TO OPPRESS or to wear down or it
[2:15:57] indicates a partially successful attempt
[2:16:01] to defeat.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; That's pretty key key word there.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Partially.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL WHERE YOU'RE
[2:16:11] DRAGGING. OH MY GOODNESS. YOU'RE NOT
[2:16:14] DEFEATED. YOU'RE NOT FLAT OUT AND DEAD.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT LIKE, "HEY, COME ON. I'M
[2:16:19] OUT." NO, NO, NO. PARTIALLY ABLE,
[2:16:22] BROTHER. I am through a battle, but I
[2:16:24] can't do it ANY LONGER. YES, YOU CAN.
[2:16:27] YOU GOT YOU CAN DO THIS. WE CAN DO ALL
[2:16:29] THINGS THROUGH CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENTH
[2:16:31] US. GET UP. I DON'T KNOW. YOU CAN DO IT.
[2:16:33] AND SO, YOU'RE DOWN THERE. YOU'RE JUST
[2:16:36] partially defeated because scripture
[2:16:39] says he shall wear out the saints.
[2:16:42] Partially defeat the saints.
[2:16:46] And this picture, it kind of comes to
[2:16:47] this slow grinding
[2:16:50] exhaustion to the faithful
[2:16:54] under a hostile rule and an oppression
[2:16:57] from an enemy that targets both your
[2:16:59] body and your spirit.
[2:17:05] and you become under great defeat and
[2:17:08] fatigue,
[2:17:10] don't be weary and welloing.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Because it's right here at this moment
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; that God starts to pour in
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; and he starts to infuse you with
[2:17:24] strength and you start to realize this
[2:17:28] is the hour. If I could say this here
[2:17:30] tonight, this is your hour of a second
[2:17:33] wind of God.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; If you are in that place, little mommy,
[2:17:38] or you're in that little place, little
[2:17:39] daddy, THIS SERVICE TONIGHT IS GOD'S
[2:17:42] CALL TO YOU, SAYING, "I HAVEN'T
[2:17:43] FORGOTTEN YOU. I HAVE NOT FORSAKEN YOU.
[2:17:46] I REMEMBERED YOU, AND I KNOW YOU'RE
[2:17:47] GIVEN OUT, AND I KNOW YOU'RE WEARY, AND
[2:17:49] I KNOW YOU'RE LOW, BUT I'M HERE.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE." YOU MIGHT BE 29 MINUTES DEAD
[2:17:54] THERE WITH NO AIR, BUT I'M HERE TO
[2:17:56] INFUSE YOU. You
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; know this world they give you know they
[2:18:05] give everything. The world gives their
[2:18:07] everything.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Who here has not have you walked around
[2:18:10] this earth not in the last few years?
[2:18:13] I'm sure you could go in this your last
[2:18:14] week and you've watched the world give
[2:18:17] their all to darkness.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; They are passionate.
[2:18:26] They are zealous.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's their
[2:18:29] entertainment, their gaming, THEIR
[2:18:31] SPORTS, THEIR POLIT POLITICS. I DON'T
[2:18:33] CARE WHAT IT IS, MAN. THEY HAVE JUST
[2:18:36] GIVEN ALL AND GIVEN OVER.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; They have.
[2:18:43] They It's like they don't even grow
[2:18:45] weary.
[2:18:49] Far be it that God will ever let his
[2:18:52] people
[2:18:55] be outdone by Satan's kingdom.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; And so he's here tonight to say
[2:19:05] it's time for a second wind.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; It's been long. I know it's time for a
[2:19:12] second wind.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; I'm here to breathe life into you. Okay.
[2:19:19] It's the extra effort. It's the 100%
[2:19:22] that brings you to receive the blessing.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Tonight, you need to put in 100%. God
[2:19:28] wants to give you a blessing tonight.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; But you need to be like Rahab who
[2:19:32] actually welcomed the enemy and exposed
[2:19:34] herself.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; She exposed herself to threat.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; SHE HAD TO STEP OUT a little bit and be
[2:19:40] like, "Yeah, these guys are different.
[2:19:42] I've been watching. But what if Rahab,
[2:19:44] what if they're actually planted spies
[2:19:46] to seek out maybe somebody inside the
[2:19:48] king's kind of got A GOT A HEADS up that
[2:19:50] THERE'S MAYBE AN INTERNAL WHAT IF WHAT
[2:19:52] IF RAHAB? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I JUST FEEL
[2:19:54] A PULL. I I FEEL CALLED. I NEED TO REACH
[2:19:56] OUT TO THESE TWO MEN HERE. I DON'T KNOW.
[2:19:58] BUT SHE HAD TO STEP OUT IN FAITH AND GO
[2:20:00] ALL IN. SHE HAD TO GIVE OVER COMPLETELY
[2:20:03] AND SAY, "HEY, UM, do you need a place?
[2:20:07] Uh, you know, it was kind of code word
[2:20:09] going on there to get them over to her
[2:20:10] house." And what she found out, as
[2:20:12] brother Brown says, there were two
[2:20:13] little tape BOYS COMING TO SHARE THE
[2:20:14] MESSAGE TO HER. WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS
[2:20:16] WILLING TO STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT AND
[2:20:19] SAY, "HEY, COME INTO MY HOUSE." MAYBE
[2:20:21] YOU NEED TO STEP OUT A LITTLE BIT AND
[2:20:22] SAY, "LORD, COME INTO MY HOUSE."
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to be like blind
[2:20:26] Barnameus that he had to cry OUT A
[2:20:28] LITTLE BIT MORE.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; NOT BY JUST VOICE, BUT BY FAITH. HAD TO
[2:20:32] CRY A LITTLE BIT MORE AND STEP OUT AND
[2:20:34] GO ALL IN
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; 100%. OH GOD.
[2:20:40] HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; MAYBE YOU need to do that tonight.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need to be like Zakius who had
[2:20:44] to climb a tree. Short little guy. Had
[2:20:45] to climb a tree. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET
[2:20:46] UP THERE LIKE, "OH, dear goodness. I'M
[2:20:48] NOT I REALLY GET MY CLOTHES DIRTY, GET
[2:20:50] SOME GRASS STAINS AND AND BARK STAINS ON
[2:20:52] MY ON MY SWEET ROBE THAT I JUST PAID
[2:20:54] FOR." YEAH, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO THAT.
[2:20:56] MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET UP AND CRY. MAYBE
[2:20:57] YOU GOT TO WIPE YOUR NOSE, BROTHER CALL
[2:20:59] SNOTTY AND WHATEVER ELSE. MAYBE YOU GOT
[2:21:01] TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; Peter had to cast his net on the other
[2:21:05] side and humble himself to the word. Are
[2:21:08] you kidding me? I'm a fisherman. I've
[2:21:10] fished HERE ALL MY LIFE. YOU'RE TELLING
[2:21:12] ME TO THROW MY NET ON the other side?
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Peter. On the other side. You mean
[2:21:18] I need to believe your word? WHAT DO YOU
[2:21:21] KNOW ABOUT FISHING? OH, PRETTY much
[2:21:23] everything. I created them. YOU IMAGINE
[2:21:26] WHAT JESUS is thinking right there?
[2:21:29] Peter, in the beginning was the word and
[2:21:31] the WORD WAS WITH GOD. I WAS IN THE
[2:21:32] BEGINNING. I WAS BEFORE THE BEGINNING. I
[2:21:34] PUT THAT FISH IN THE WATER. JUST THROW
[2:21:36] YOUR NET OVER, WILL YOU? But no, he
[2:21:39] waited. He waited. Peter, throw your net
[2:21:42] over.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:21:45] Humbled himself to the word.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Maybe like Nathaniel we talked about or
[2:21:51] the Hebrew boys that defied a decree.
[2:21:53] These are all PEOPLE IN SCRIPTURE THAT
[2:21:55] WENT ALL BEYOND 100%.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, NEBUCHADNEZZAR,
[2:22:01] burn us.
[2:22:07] Yeah, that's some given all.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Even if our God won't deliver us.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Even if
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you the 99%
[2:22:23] was we won't bow. Our God's going to
[2:22:24] come and and and but if he doesn't, well
[2:22:27] then maybe we'll think about it. That's
[2:22:29] 99%. 100% all of it is we'll never bow.
[2:22:34] WE'LL NEVER COMPROMISE. I'LL NEVER FALL
[2:22:36] FOR THESE THINGS OF THIS WORLD. AND EVEN
[2:22:38] SO, IF I HAVE TO GO DOWN, I DON'T REALLY
[2:22:41] CARE WHAT I GOT GOING TO BE DRAGGED
[2:22:42] THROUGH THE FIRE, BUT I WILL NOT AND
[2:22:44] WILL NOT COMPROMISE.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S 100%.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How about David had to break ranks
[2:22:51] with Israel.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; I'M JUST GIVING YOU SOMEBODY SOME
[2:22:53] DIFFERENT ONES THAT HAD TO GO A LITTLE
[2:22:55] BIT MORE TO RECEIVE ANOTHER WIND. AMEN.
[2:22:57] BECAUSE WHEN THE HEBREW BOYS WENT INTO
[2:22:58] THAT FIRE AND THEY SAID, "OH GOD, IF YOU
[2:23:01] LET US BURN, SO BE IT. WE SERVE YOU."
[2:23:03] BUT THEN
[2:23:04] they stepped into the flame.
[2:23:11] Shadrach, man, I still smell that
[2:23:13] ointment you put on this morning. I was
[2:23:16] preparing for the trial.
[2:23:19] No smoke? No. Can you believe it? Whoa.
[2:23:22] Who's this?
[2:23:24] WHO'S THIS? WELL, IT'S ONE LIKE UNDER
[2:23:26] THE SON OF GOD THAT'S STANDING IN OUR
[2:23:28] MIDST. WHY? BECAUSE WE WENT ALL THE WAY.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; AND GOD THEN BROUGHT A WIND.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; It's nice in here. It's balmy 72°.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because a second wind came
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; when they gave everything.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; David broke ranks. All of Israel's
[2:23:48] trembling at the knee. Oh my goodness.
[2:23:50] There's
[2:23:52] David's like, "What are you knees
[2:23:54] knocking for? There's no drums beating.
[2:23:55] My goodness, there's a lot of kneecaps
[2:24:00] and he looked at that line.
[2:24:04] Soldiers lined up there, lined up
[2:24:06] there." He's like, "Really, David?
[2:24:09] You're going to do this?
[2:24:13] What do the pressure?" I mean, I don't
[2:24:15] want everybody's everybody standing. I
[2:24:16] don't want to be the one that stands
[2:24:17] out. I mean, I'd really be the one to
[2:24:19] step out in faith. I mean, look at all
[2:24:21] my friends around me. They're just
[2:24:22] holding the line here. Yeah, but there's
[2:24:24] a giant there that's defying of God. Oh,
[2:24:27] man.
[2:24:32] ALL RIGHT, GOLIATH.
[2:24:34] WHEN HE DID THAT, IT WAS OVER FOR
[2:24:36] GOLIATH, RIGHT? BUT DAVID HAD TO GET
[2:24:38] PAST THE 99% AND GO 100% SO THAT HE
[2:24:42] COULD START WHIPPING OUT HIS SWING AND
[2:24:43] SAYING, "ALL RIGHT, THIS DAY, THIS DAY
[2:24:45] YOUR HEAD'S COMING OFF."
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:48] HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; Only when he did this
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; did the wind
[2:24:54] &gt;&gt; start to blow
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; this is your night.
[2:25:03] &gt;&gt; This is your night to step out a little
[2:25:05] different.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; This is your night to be a David, a
[2:25:07] Jacob, an Abraham, a Moses, a Paul,
[2:25:08] maybe a Ruth, but leave it all behind.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Orpa couldn't do it. Orpa couldn't do
[2:25:17] it.
[2:25:19] Oh, just a pull to be home in the
[2:25:22] comfort of her family.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; But Ruth,
[2:25:28] Ruth,
[2:25:30] she was willing to leave everything she
[2:25:31] knew.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; And the wind of God
[2:25:38] blew a Boaz by her way. That's right.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight, saints of God, what
[2:25:46] God's wanting to blow tonight.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; What is he wanting to blow from this
[2:25:54] word?
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; But he's needing you to step
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; out
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; and give everything.
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; Queen of Sheba was willing to leave.
[2:26:09] Esther was willing to go and die. The
[2:26:11] widow of Zerapath put the word before
[2:26:14] her own health and her son's existence.
[2:26:16] Daniel faced lions and prayed in the
[2:26:18] face of the law. If none of these were
[2:26:22] willing to go the extra mile,
[2:26:25] they would have never received the
[2:26:27] promise. They would never receive the
[2:26:30] outcome that scripture has.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; But they were predestined.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know why? Because behind you
[2:26:40] actually is the word. It's pushing you.
[2:26:43] It's pushing YOU LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF I
[2:26:45] CAN. IT'S LIKE you can. AND IT'S
[2:26:47] ACTUALLY PUSHING YOU. YOUR PREDESTINATED
[2:26:49] SEAT IS IN THERE. SO THE WORD PUSHES YOU
[2:26:52] ONWARD. AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO THE
[2:26:54] 100% THEN IT BLOWS AND IT BREATHE IN AN
[2:26:57] INFUSION INTO YOU. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT
[2:26:59] WIN.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T HELP BUT CROSS OVER. GLORY.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT HIM BEHIND YOU LIKE THEY DID IN
[2:27:12] ISRAEL. THEY HAD A PILLAR OF FIRE. IT
[2:27:14] WAS BLOCKING FROM ALL SIDES. EGYPT
[2:27:16] COULDN'T EVEN GET THERE UNTIL GOD LIFTED
[2:27:18] THE FLAME.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; He's like, "Okay, now you can go and try
[2:27:23] to pursue them."
[2:27:25] What a mockery. If Pharaoh only knew God
[2:27:29] played cat and mouse with him.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, now you can go and try and get
[2:27:34] them. Oh, oops.
[2:27:38] Water.
[2:27:40] You don't think that's not happening to
[2:27:41] you?
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; You don't think THERE WAS JOB SITTING
[2:27:43] THERE? HE HAD NO IDEA THE CONVERSATION.
[2:27:45] BUT REALLY, GOD WAS JUST CAT AND MOUSE
[2:27:47] WITH THE DEVIL. OH, HELL. ALL RIGHT.
[2:27:48] I'LL LET YOU GO A LITTLE BIT LONGER. OH,
[2:27:50] OOPS. Pull you out of there. I'm going
[2:27:52] to put it back into Job.
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO DOUBLE THE PORTION.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Is that your God?
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Is he going to treat Job differently
[2:28:02] than you? You going to treat Moses and
[2:28:05] the children of Isra is Israel
[2:28:06] differently than you?
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. No, no, no.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; But he's just saying give it everything.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Give the two might
[2:28:22] say my everything is so small.
[2:28:26] I preached a little bit ago about the
[2:28:28] two mites. You know how much it was
[2:28:29] worth? US cents. 1/8 of a cent. That's
[2:28:32] what she gave 1/8 of a penny. You don't
[2:28:35] even make pennies anymore. They just
[2:28:37] ended a few days ago. I believe
[2:28:39] Pennsylvania printed your first penny or
[2:28:41] stamped it out or wherever it was. Cut
[2:28:43] it up into eight pieces and find the
[2:28:45] little morsel of copper and then try and
[2:28:48] pay something with that. Hey, uh, pretty
[2:28:51] hungry today. I need a loaf of bread and
[2:28:52] a gallon of milk. What do you got? Well,
[2:28:55] that looks like a speck of dust. Yeah,
[2:28:57] it's a eighth of a penny. Can it get me
[2:28:58] anywhere?
[2:29:00] Are you insane?
[2:29:04] Sometimes I think people feel like that
[2:29:06] way and they're coming to God with an
[2:29:07] eighth of a penny of their ability and
[2:29:10] you think God is saying that to you. Are
[2:29:12] you what I'm saying? I'm here to tell
[2:29:14] you tonight God is saying that's all I
[2:29:16] desire.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's all I need. I just need the
[2:29:20] everything. If it's a small, don't ever
[2:29:23] think what you have is small. God
[2:29:26] standing there looking at saying that's
[2:29:28] worth more than the world's to me.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; I'll give another example.
[2:29:39] Are we okay?
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; You on your second win yet?
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; You know I got one service. You know
[2:29:47] that.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; So I'm going to give it all I got.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when I hit my second win.
[2:29:57] Amen. Matthew 27 says here was a thief
[2:30:00] on the cross and what he hadn't done. I
[2:30:02] I want to imagine what what would HAVE
[2:30:04] HAPPENED IF HE HADN'T GONE THE EXTRA.
[2:30:06] WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IS HE WAS THERE
[2:30:08] HANGING ON THE CROSS AND AND HE was
[2:30:10] there now with with with THIS OTHER
[2:30:12] THIEF BESIDE Jesus and they WERE THERE
[2:30:14] AND WHAT IF HE HAD NOT GONE 100% and I'm
[2:30:16] just going to tell you HE WAS SUFFERING
[2:30:17] BIG TIME ON A CROSS. NONE OF US HAVE
[2:30:20] EXPERIENCED THAT. None of us have had
[2:30:22] know what it's like to to be hung on a
[2:30:24] cross. AND HERE HE was being being HUNG
[2:30:27] BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN AND HIS ARMS
[2:30:29] STRETCHED OUT AND HIS FEET THERE NAILED
[2:30:31] OR tied or whatever it would have been
[2:30:33] and HIS STRENGTH AND HE WAS THERE
[2:30:35] MOCKING AND HE'D HAVE TO RAISE UP. YEAH.
[2:30:39] WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? AND THE OTHER
[2:30:40] ONE WOULD RAIL ON HIM. YOU CALLED
[2:30:42] YOURSELF THE SON OF GOD. AND THEN THEY'D
[2:30:44] MAYBE HEAR THE PRIEST DOWN there and be
[2:30:45] like, yeah. You know what he said? He
[2:30:47] said if he tear this temple in three
[2:30:48] days, he'd raise it up. Can you imagine
[2:30:50] the thief there on the other one railing
[2:30:52] on him? The scripture says he saved
[2:30:54] others himself he cannot save. If he be
[2:30:56] the king of Israel, let him come now
[2:30:58] come down from the cross and we'll
[2:30:59] BELIEVE HIM. HE TRUSTED IN GOD. LET HIM
[2:31:02] DELIVER HIM NOW if he'll have him before
[2:31:04] he said I am the son of God. And the
[2:31:05] thieves also which were CRUCIFIED WITH
[2:31:08] HIM CAST THE SAME IN HIS TEETH.
[2:31:13] YEAH.
[2:31:16] YOU YOU SAID AND THEY WORKED hard to
[2:31:20] cast it in his teeth.
[2:31:28] King and then the other one a king
[2:31:31] and he just stand there push himself up
[2:31:34] and sack back down.
[2:31:40] But something changed
[2:31:43] and one thief continued to rail.
[2:31:47] But something happened.
[2:31:49] And the other thief in this moment
[2:31:53] in Luke, it starts to says, "But then
[2:31:55] the other answering rebuked, dust thou
[2:31:57] not fear God, seeing thou art in the
[2:32:00] same condemnation?"
[2:32:01] And we indeed now he's saying this back
[2:32:04] at the thief and he's working.
[2:32:07] des not fear God. And he's now working
[2:32:11] because he's at the end
[2:32:14] and he's working to spit these words out
[2:32:17] and we
[2:32:19] intate us.
[2:32:25] And I imagine if he's right there at the
[2:32:27] very last aspects
[2:32:30] of his mortal breath
[2:32:32] and he turns
[2:32:34] and he works
[2:32:38] hard.
[2:32:45] The work's still back up.
[2:32:48] Remember
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; me
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; when
[2:32:57] come
[2:32:59] into
[2:33:01] thy kingdom.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; He gave everything.
[2:33:16] everything.
[2:33:18] What if he stopped at 99%.
[2:33:24] What if he ended?
[2:33:31] I can't do it
[2:33:33] and he couldn't get out the rest. And
[2:33:36] he's one sentence away from paradise.
[2:33:42] But he gave everything.
[2:33:50] And then on the other cross
[2:33:55] another one is hanging
[2:33:59] and says
[2:34:02] today
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; today
[2:34:10] you'll be with me
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; in paradise. Amen.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; I can tell you
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; those last moments of Baptist life
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; were very different.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; As he waited and the last breath
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; went out from him
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; and he took another one in paradise.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:34:42] because he was willing to give it all.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; And then God came behind.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I just wonder because
[2:34:51] then there was another one that still
[2:34:53] had to give his last.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; And for you and I, he was there.
[2:35:01] It
[2:35:06] is
[2:35:10] finished.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And he gave all.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; So that you and I could have another
[2:35:20] breath with that thief on the cross. If
[2:35:23] he hadn't given everything, IF HE HADN'T
[2:35:25] GAVE HIS LAST AND FINAL. AND AFTER THE
[2:35:28] LAST BREATH, GOD CAME AND INFUSED.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; AFTER HIS LAST BREATH IN THIS EARTH,
[2:35:36] THERE'S ANOTHER BREATH WAITING FOR YOU
[2:35:38] AND I. AFTER THE LAST BREATH IN THIS
[2:35:40] TIME, THERE'S ETERNITY WAITING FOR YOU
[2:35:42] AND I. WHY? BECAUSE HE DID IT.
[2:35:47] ARE YOU WILLING to
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; wind of his spirit was released on
[2:35:58] Calvary
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; so that her bride could be birthed
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; and a masterpiece could be born.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now. Go to Michael.
[2:36:14] He said, "I'm very weary though.
[2:36:19] I'm so worn down with burdens."
[2:36:23] I know. He knows. Actually,
[2:36:28] he knows. And he's here tonight to say,
[2:36:31] "I'm I'm here to breathe. I'm breathing
[2:36:34] to you strength."
[2:36:40] David was
[2:36:42] There was his men fought a fight a
[2:36:45] battle or fought a battle came to
[2:36:48] Ziglaggle
[2:36:49] on the third day that the Amalachites
[2:36:51] had invaded the south and Ziglag and
[2:36:53] smitten Ziglagg and burned it with fire
[2:36:55] taking the women in captives and all
[2:36:57] that was there and slew not any either
[2:36:59] great or small but carried them away and
[2:37:01] went on their way. So David and his men
[2:37:02] came to the city. They had just been
[2:37:03] fighting another battle and they were
[2:37:05] weary. But here they came, and behold,
[2:37:06] they saw Zigleg was burned with fire,
[2:37:08] and their their wives and their sons and
[2:37:09] their daughters were all daughters were
[2:37:11] all taken captive. And David AND THE
[2:37:13] PEOPLE THAT WERE WITH HIM LIFTED UP
[2:37:15] THEIR VOICE AND WEPT
[2:37:18] until they had no more power to weep.
[2:37:22] That's what scripture says. They were so
[2:37:25] sorrowful. They had been LABORING AND
[2:37:28] FIGHTING AND BATTLING AND THEY'D BEEN
[2:37:31] GOING THROUGH BATTLE AFTER BATTLE AND
[2:37:32] THEY CAME BACK JUST TO COME and maybe
[2:37:34] receive some sustenance AND AND SOME
[2:37:36] CARE AND SOME comfort and it's all gone
[2:37:39] and they begin to weep.
[2:37:42] They're fighting man.
[2:37:45] And now David castaway and David's
[2:37:48] surviving. Now he goes home and and now
[2:37:50] the worst has really happened. And while
[2:37:52] they were gone, I'm sure as they leave
[2:37:53] they're like, "Oh God, keep our family
[2:37:54] safe." and they go back home and it's
[2:37:56] it's all gone and wiped out. And David
[2:37:58] was greatly distressed for the people.
[2:38:00] And the people spake of stoning him.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE SO UPSET. THINK OF IT. THESE
[2:38:06] PEOPLE IN a moment of actual anger and
[2:38:08] rage, they were going to stone David. I
[2:38:10] mean, they were following David pretty
[2:38:12] pretty strongly. But now, IN THIS MOMENT
[2:38:13] OF SORROW, THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE STONING
[2:38:15] YOU. YOU'VE LED US THIS WAY. YOU'VE LED
[2:38:17] US THIS FAR. AND NOW HERE I AM. OUR
[2:38:19] FAMILIES are gone." And they're and
[2:38:21] they're anguish. And they're fainting
[2:38:22] and they're wearying. And David, the
[2:38:24] scripture says, "But David
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; encouraged himself in the Lord his God."
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine everybody around you?
[2:38:33] &gt;&gt; You know, come on. I can imagine even
[2:38:35] hearing this AT THIS HOUR. REALLY? I'VE
[2:38:37] BEEN GOING THIS FAR DOWN THE DOWN THIS
[2:38:39] ROAD. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE
[2:38:40] THIS LONG AND THEN THIS HAS HAPPENED TO
[2:38:42] ME AND THIS HARDSHIP HAS HAPPENED TO ME
[2:38:43] AND AND EVERYTHING IS GONE AND I'VE LEFT
[2:38:45] HOMES AND I'VE LEFT FAMILIES AND I'VE
[2:38:47] SACRIFICED AND THIS IS ALL IT'S GOTTEN
[2:38:49] ME.
[2:38:53] Someone gets so tired and weary.
[2:38:56] DAVID, I'M DONE FOLLOWING YOU. That's
[2:38:59] what they were at this place.
[2:39:02] David must have walked away, found a
[2:39:05] quiet place.
[2:39:09] He might be in a place like this.
[2:39:13] And you need to walk away in a quiet
[2:39:15] place.
[2:39:19] He pulls out maybe in his little satchel
[2:39:23] he keeps some of his most special psalms
[2:39:25] that he's wrote. He starts to pull it
[2:39:28] out. He starts to read cuz there's
[2:39:31] actually some psalms that are considered
[2:39:33] like golden psalms that actually are
[2:39:36] articulated there with a certain word.
[2:39:38] Psalm 56 and he must started reading it.
[2:39:41] He said, "Lord, I'm low."
[2:39:48] He said, "Lord, be merciful unto me, oh
[2:39:51] God, for a man would swallow me up. He
[2:39:55] fighting daily oppresseth me. Mine
[2:39:57] enemies would daily swallow me up. For
[2:39:59] they be many that fight against me, oh
[2:40:00] most high. What time I am afraid I will
[2:40:02] trust in thee. In God I will praise his
[2:40:05] word. In God I have put my trust. I will
[2:40:07] not FEAR WHAT FLESH CAN DO UNTO ME. Thou
[2:40:09] tellest ME MY WANDERINGS. PUT THOU MY
[2:40:12] TEARS INTO THY BOTTLE. ARE THEY NOT IN
[2:40:15] THY BOOK? GOD, THINK ABOUT IT, LORD. PUT
[2:40:17] MY TEARS OF ANGUISH INTO A BOTTLE.
[2:40:19] CHERISH THEM. SEE MY NEED, OH GOD. YOU
[2:40:23] SEE MY GROANINGS AND MY MY FAILINGS. OH,
[2:40:25] DON'T FORGET them when I cry unto thee.
[2:40:27] Then shall my enemies turn back. FOR
[2:40:29] THIS I KNOW, FOR GOD IS WITH IS FOR ME.
[2:40:31] IN GOD WHEN I PRAISE his word. AND HE
[2:40:33] STARTS TO rehearse these and something
[2:40:35] starts to change. He starts to look back
[2:40:38] maybe when he was in a cave and he was
[2:40:40] writing there when he WAS HE WAS
[2:40:42] HUNKERED DOWN. HE SAYS, "I WILL CRY
[2:40:44] UNDER THE GOD MY MOST HIGH UNTO GOD THAT
[2:40:46] perforth all things for me. HE SHALL
[2:40:48] ASCEND FROM SEND FROM HEAVEN AND SAVE ME
[2:40:50] from the reproach." He's remembering.
[2:40:52] He's encouraging. He's saying, "Lord
[2:40:54] God, I need your strength right now.
[2:40:56] Maybe you need to encourage yourself
[2:40:57] with the Lord a little bit. You need to
[2:40:58] go back TO THOSE TIMES WHEN GOD WAS WITH
[2:41:00] YOU. BACK TO THOSE TIMES WHEN HE SAVED
[2:41:02] YOU. BACK TO THE CAVE. BACK TO THAT
[2:41:04] PLACE OF TIME WHEN GOD WHEN THE SATAN
[2:41:06] CAME ABOUT YOU, THERE'S A ROARING LINE
[2:41:07] AND GOD ENCOURAGED YOU TO SAY, "HEY, I
[2:41:09] WAS I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE. I WAS
[2:41:11] VICTORIOUS THERE. I WAS VICTORIOUS
[2:41:13] THERE. IF I WAS VICTORIOUS THERE,
[2:41:16] SOMETHING IN DAVID STARTED TO REACH OUT
[2:41:18] AND HE STARTED TO WRITE A NEW PSALM AND
[2:41:20] HE STARTED TO SAY, "OH, PRESERVE ME, OH
[2:41:22] GOD. FOR IN THEE DO I PUT MY TRUST, OH
[2:41:25] MY SOUL, THOU HAST SAID UNTO THE LORD,
[2:41:28] THOU ART MY LORD. THE LORD IS A PORTION
[2:41:30] OF MY INHERITANCE AND MY CUP. THOU
[2:41:32] MAINTAINEST MY LOT. Inspiration start
[2:41:34] bubbling out from him. Maybe tonight a
[2:41:38] little bit of inspiration needs to
[2:41:39] bubble out from you.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; And what happened to David?
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; He raises up and all despair starts to
[2:41:46] fall from around him.
[2:41:49] You might be in a disaster. Just start
[2:41:51] encouraging yourself in the Lord a
[2:41:52] little bit.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; He walks back to the group. Very
[2:41:55] different spirit. They're all still
[2:41:57] sorrowful and crying. Maybe some still
[2:41:59] have stones in their hand. Where'd you
[2:42:01] go?
[2:42:03] I was just encouraging myself and the
[2:42:04] Lord a little bit. I just wrote a new
[2:42:06] psalm.
[2:42:10] Said, "Well, what do you have to say
[2:42:12] about this?" He says, "Call the priest."
[2:42:15] He says, "Pray, bring me hither and
[2:42:17] ephod." Abathar brought these ephod. And
[2:42:20] David inquired of the Lord, "Shall I
[2:42:21] pursue AFTER THIS TROOP? SHALL I
[2:42:23] OVERTAKE THEM? SHALL I GO AND GET THEM?
[2:42:25] SHALL I RAISE UP AND GO AFTER MY
[2:42:27] RIGHTFUL POSSESSION? HE SAYS, AND HE
[2:42:29] ANSWERED, PURSUE, FOR THOU SHALT
[2:42:32] OVERTAKE THEM AND WITHOUT FAIL RECOVER
[2:42:36] ALL.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IN
[2:42:40] THE LORD DOES. YOU START REALIZING THAT
[2:42:42] YOU ARE MORE THAN AN OVERCOMER. YOU CAN
[2:42:44] GO BACK TO THE WORD AND IT'LL TELL YOU
[2:42:46] OVER AND OVER AGAIN, GO PURSUE. GO TAKE
[2:42:49] YOUR INHERITANCE. GO TAKE IT BECAUSE
[2:42:51] I'VE DECREED THROUGH MY WORD YOU SHALL
[2:42:55] RECOVER ALL.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; PURSUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. PURSUE THE DEVIL
[2:43:05] TONIGHT. TAKE WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY YOURS.
[2:43:08] MAY GOD BREATHE INTO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:43:10] THEY WERE WEARY. They were down LIKE
[2:43:12] THIS. THEY COULDN'T EVEN GET THEIR WIND.
[2:43:14] Are you kidding me? I just fought a
[2:43:15] battle after battle and I don't even
[2:43:17] have vituals.
[2:43:19] No, but the word just said that we can
[2:43:22] we can pursue and get it all.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Well, in that case, let's go.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; In that case, let's go.
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; You're more than overcomers.
[2:43:35] GOD'S ALREADY WON THE BATTLE FOR YOU. HE
[2:43:37] DID IT ON CALVARY. HE SAID, "I'M YOUR
[2:43:39] HEALER OF ALL DISEASES. GET UP
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; AND IN BE INFUSED TONIGHT. TAKE WHAT'S
[2:43:44] YOURS.
[2:43:50] THIS BLOOD TOKEN IS ABLE TO DO
[2:43:52] EVERYTHING YOU NEED OF.
[2:43:56] &gt;&gt; THE SAME GOD THAT TOLD DAVID TO GO AND
[2:43:58] PURSUE IS THE SAME GOD HERE TONIGHT
[2:44:00] SAYING, "PURSUE."
[2:44:02] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST need to RECEIVE IT TONIGHT.
[2:44:04] MAYBE YOU NEED TO STAND ON YOUR FEET
[2:44:05] LIKE THESE BROTHERS. MAYBE YOU NEED TO
[2:44:06] ACCEPT IT TONIGHT AND SAY, "LORD, I'M A
[2:44:08] LITTLE WEARY. I'M A LITTLE LOW. I'VE
[2:44:11] BEEN THROUGH A WHOLE LOT TONIGHT, BUT
[2:44:13] THIS IS MY HOUR. I NEED A SECOND WIN.
[2:44:18] IF
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; GOD COULD GIVE IT to to a David, he'll
[2:44:21] give it to you.
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; He'll give it to you. He'll give it to
[2:44:24] me.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT A DEBTOR TO NO MAN.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE WEARY.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; Fate not.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; God's got some dry bones coming to life
[2:44:36] right here.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; You can just worship him. YOU SAY, "OH,
[2:44:41] BROTHER MICHAEL." BUT THEY WENT OVER AND
[2:44:43] PURSUED.
[2:44:45] You can still stand. I'm closed. The
[2:44:46] musicians can come. He said, "I don't
[2:44:50] know if I even have the strength to
[2:44:51] stand. I'm so tired." Yeah. Some
[2:44:54] couldn't even get across the river.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; You couldn't even get up across the
[2:44:59] river.
[2:45:03] I've been walking this road so long.
[2:45:07] Let the younger ones go. They can do it.
[2:45:12] There wasn't no knocking against them.
[2:45:15] They were tired.
[2:45:17] I have a scripture for you.
[2:45:22] Because there were believers in Acts two
[2:45:24] that received an infusing of God. The
[2:45:27] wind blew
[2:45:28] mighty rushing wind.
[2:45:31] But in Acts 4,
[2:45:35] I believe it was Peter and John. And I
[2:45:37] think Peter, they were they were let go
[2:45:38] out of prison. And they went to their
[2:45:40] own company, the scripture says, and
[2:45:42] reported to all that the chief priests
[2:45:43] and elders had said unto them. And when
[2:45:45] they had heard that, they lifted up
[2:45:46] their voice to God, and they started to
[2:45:48] pray. Maybe a little praying tonight
[2:45:51] with one accord and said, Lord God, thou
[2:45:54] art God, which hast made heaven and
[2:45:55] earth, and sea, and all that is IN THEM.
[2:45:57] WHO BY THE MOUTH OF THY SERVANT DAVID
[2:45:59] HAS SAID, WHY DID THE HEATHEN RAGE? And
[2:46:00] the people imagine vain things. The
[2:46:02] kings OF THE EARTH STOOD UP AND THE
[2:46:04] RULERS WERE GATHERED together against
[2:46:05] the Lord, against his Christ. For of a
[2:46:07] truth, against a holy child Jesus, whom
[2:46:09] thou HAST ANOINTED. THIS IS THEIR
[2:46:11] PRAYER. IN ONE MIND AND ACCORD BOTH
[2:46:13] HEROD AND PONTIUS PILATE AND THE
[2:46:15] GENTILES AND PEOPLE OF ISRAEL were
[2:46:17] gathered together for to do whatsoever
[2:46:19] thy hand AND THY COUNSEL DETERMINED
[2:46:21] BEFORE TO BE DONE. OH LORD, BEHOLD their
[2:46:24] threatenings.
[2:46:27] Oh Lord, BEHOLD MY CHILD. BEHOLD, what's
[2:46:32] going in my life, MY FAMILY, MY ISSUES
[2:46:34] HERE, MY MY SICKNESS, MY DISEASE. OH
[2:46:36] GOD, BEHOLD THE THREATENINGS.
[2:46:39] They'd been they' had a Holy Ghost
[2:46:41] experience just a couple chapters ago.
[2:46:44] They're saying, "Oh, God, we're weary.
[2:46:46] We're being threatened. WE'RE WORN DOWN.
[2:46:49] OUR NERVES ARE SHOT. WE'VE BEEN HIDING
[2:46:50] HERE AND HIDING, RACING HERE, PREACHING
[2:46:52] HERE, AND THEN GETTING CAUGHT THERE AND
[2:46:54] PRAYING TO GET THIS ONE OUT OF JAIL
[2:46:55] THERE. OH GOD,
[2:47:00] grant to thy servants that with all
[2:47:02] boldness they may speak thy word by
[2:47:03] stretching forth thy hand. Lord, we need
[2:47:05] boldness. We need a little show of your
[2:47:07] glory among us again. We need a little
[2:47:09] outpouring. WE NEED A LITTLE SECOND
[2:47:10] WIND. WE NEED ANOTHER ANOINTING THAT YOU
[2:47:12] COULD JUST BLOW THROUGH.
[2:47:17] It says, "And when they had prayed,
[2:47:20] the place was shaken where they were
[2:47:22] assembled together and they were filled
[2:47:25] with the Holy Ghost and they spake the
[2:47:27] word of God with boldness."
[2:47:31] This was another breathing, if I could
[2:47:34] say, a second wind of his spirit blew
[2:47:37] through. They had a feeling at Pentecost
[2:47:39] at Acts 2, but Acts four came along and
[2:47:41] said, "Lord, I need a little more. I
[2:47:43] need a little more strength tonight.
[2:47:45] I've been down this road a little long.
[2:47:46] I've been laboring and I've been cutting
[2:47:48] through and I've BEEN LIKE DAVID, BUT I
[2:47:50] NEED a little bit of an infusion
[2:47:51] tonight. Maybe tonight the people of God
[2:47:53] need to raise up a voice and start to
[2:47:55] pray. You can lift up your voice tonight
[2:47:57] and SAY, "OH GOD, I ALSO NEED A SECOND
[2:47:59] WIND TONIGHT. I ALSO NEED AN INFUSION.
[2:48:02] I'VE GIVEN YOU MY HEART. I'VE LAID IT AT
[2:48:04] YOUR FEET TONIGHT. I NEED THE WIND OF
[2:48:06] YOUR SPIRIT TO BLOW THROUGH." That's
[2:48:09] what he can do tonight. But it's in your
[2:48:11] hands now. It's out of my hands. IT'S IN
[2:48:13] YOUR HANDS. GOD HAS NOW LAID IT TO YOU
[2:48:15] AND SAY NOW CRY OUT. MAYBE YOU NEED TO
[2:48:17] BE A BLIND BARNAMEUS. Maybe you need to
[2:48:18] be a Ruth or an Esther. It's to you now.
[2:48:21] It's in your hands. He's here to do
[2:48:25] everything you have asked and need for.
[2:48:27] I believe it with all my heart. This is
[2:48:29] your meeting. This is your hour. This is
[2:48:32] your moment. May a second wind blow
[2:48:35] right here.
[2:48:54] Oh god.
[2:48:58] Now is the critical moment. Actually,
[2:49:01] now is the critical moment.
[2:49:06] It's that moment where it passes between
[2:49:09] the preacher and the people
[2:49:12] and Satan desires to get right in the
[2:49:14] middle.
[2:49:18] But I believe the Holy Spirit is healed
[2:49:20] greater. The Holy Holy Ghost is here's
[2:49:22] greater. So I pray oh God tonight
[2:49:26] whatever
[2:49:28] whatever Lord you desire to do Lord may
[2:49:31] nothing here hinder your moving now.
[2:49:37] Hallelujah.
[2:49:40] Let's just sing peace like a river.
[2:49:42] Peace like a river. I just let's just
[2:49:46] mind the Lord right here right now.
[2:49:49] Peace
[2:49:50] like
[2:49:52] a river. River
[2:49:56] and love
[2:49:58] like
[2:49:59] a mountain.
[2:50:02] Oh, the wind
[2:50:05] wind of your spirit.
[2:50:09] Oh, it's blowing
[2:50:13] everywhere.
[2:50:16] Why don't you reach out? You're alive
[2:50:20] like a fountain
[2:50:24] and heing
[2:50:27] streams of life.
[2:50:30] Oh
[2:50:32] come,
[2:50:34] Holy
[2:50:35] Spirit,
[2:50:38] let your fire.
[2:50:42] Amen. Let's sing that to him. Let be
[2:50:44] that your prayer tonight. Oh peace,
[2:50:47] peace like a river.
[2:50:53] Oh love like oh a mountain
[2:50:59] and the wind
[2:51:02] of your spirit
[2:51:05] it is blowing
[2:51:10] everywhere.
[2:51:13] Oh, and joy,
[2:51:16] joy like a fountain.
[2:51:20] Oh, and he
[2:51:24] streams of life.
[2:51:27] Oh, come
[2:51:30] home.
[2:51:32] The spirit
[2:51:35] let you fire.
[2:51:41] Maybe before we sing it one more time
[2:51:43] just to let the Holy Spirit brood. I
[2:51:45] just ponder and I I thought last night
[2:51:48] how many of the young younger ones maybe
[2:51:50] came to the front and they're wanting to
[2:51:52] give their hearts. Brother Tom was
[2:51:54] laboring. Even brother Matthew McGee
[2:51:56] saying to somebody, would you like to
[2:51:57] just give your heart to the Lord? And
[2:51:59] maybe tonight it's maybe you have given
[2:52:01] your heart to the Lord, but you need a
[2:52:02] second win tonight. Maybe you're someone
[2:52:04] who's labored for a long time. You've
[2:52:06] been in this message a long time. YOU'VE
[2:52:09] LABORED STRONG AND HARD AND YOU are a
[2:52:10] mighty VO WARRIOR. BUT TONIGHT HE'S
[2:52:12] SAYING, "LORD, I just need another
[2:52:14] breath. I need another filling of your
[2:52:17] spirit to help me move MOVE FORWARD
[2:52:19] TONIGHT. IF I can say that's your night
[2:52:21] tonight." He's here to do that tonight.
[2:52:23] Don't lose the moment. Don't don't don't
[2:52:25] lose or miss this opportunity to say,
[2:52:27] "Lord, to reach out and just let the
[2:52:29] wind of his spirit
[2:52:31] blow over your life. Don't walk out of
[2:52:34] here weary. You can walk out of here
[2:52:36] strengthened. You can walk out of here
[2:52:38] like DAVID DID. I'M READY TO pursue
[2:52:41] because he encouraged himself in the
[2:52:44] Lord. If you need prayer, you want to be
[2:52:46] in kneel in your seat. This is what this
[2:52:47] whole weekend is about. This moment,
[2:52:50] last night's moment, tomorrow morning's
[2:52:52] moment, whatever that would be, whatever
[2:52:54] God has. But tonight, don't miss this
[2:52:56] hour.
[2:52:59] You do as God lead you tonight. now. Oh,
[2:53:02] and peace
[2:53:05] like a river.
[2:53:10] And love like like a mountain.
[2:53:15] Oh, the wind
[2:53:19] of your spirit
[2:53:22] it is blowing
[2:53:25] blowing everywhere.
[2:53:28] Oh, and joy
[2:53:32] joy like oh a fountain.
[2:53:36] Oh, and heing
[2:53:39] streams come alive.
[2:53:42] Oh, this is my prayer. Come, come, holy
[2:53:47] spirit
[2:53:50] and let your fire
[2:53:54] fall welcome. Holy Spirit
[2:53:58] come. Come holy
[2:54:01] spirit
[2:54:03] let your fire
[2:54:10] your dad.
[2:54:26] Don't approach him like a sinner.
[2:54:30] He said you never did it in the first
[2:54:32] place.
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; You've been to the altar.
[2:54:40] You've confessed your sins.
[2:54:43] He said that he was faithful
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; and just to forgive them.
[2:54:50] Who can lay anything to the charge of
[2:54:53] God's elect?
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz the seed of God
[2:54:57] remains in them.
[2:55:01] So our brother talked about that first
[2:55:03] breath that gave us this life.
[2:55:06] We were born in sin,
[2:55:09] shaped in iniquity,
[2:55:11] came into the world speaking lies.
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; But that's not who we really are.
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:55:17] &gt;&gt; Way back in the beginning, Hallelujah.
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; You were in him.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; He knew you then.
[2:55:30] &gt;&gt; The color of your eyes,
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; the color of your hair,
[2:55:34] &gt;&gt; the statue you were in.
[2:55:38] That's when he slipped the wedding band
[2:55:41] of predestination
[2:55:43] on you.
[2:55:47] He wanted us to know that Calvary
[2:55:52] paid the price
[2:55:54] that allows us to go past our flesh,
[2:55:58] past our history.
[2:56:01] Do you hear what our brother said? It
[2:56:03] don't matter what you've done. It
[2:56:05] doesn't matter where you are. It doesn't
[2:56:07] Don't look back at that.
[2:56:11] &gt;&gt; Don't wrecking yourself a sinner.
[2:56:13] wrecking yourself saved.
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:56:15] &gt;&gt; And if you are a sinner, then maybe you
[2:56:18] need to come to the altar. Reckon
[2:56:20] yourself a sinner.
[2:56:22] Say you're sorry.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; And if you say you're sorry, he said,
[2:56:27] "I'm just
[2:56:30] faithful
[2:56:32] to forgive you."
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; Don't substitute the promise
[2:56:37] for a human action.
[2:56:42] take him at his word.
[2:56:44] Our brother said tonight, he said, "Our
[2:56:47] life, our history,
[2:56:50] our past
[2:56:52] was the result of the breath that we got
[2:56:55] from our first husband.
[2:57:00] I don't care who you are,
[2:57:04] your natural record
[2:57:07] isn't very good.
[2:57:11] But the gift of God
[2:57:14] &gt;&gt; is a second breath.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; Scripture says Jesus walked into the
[2:57:19] room and he breathed on him and said,
[2:57:22] "Receive
[2:57:24] the Holy Spirit."
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to lay down your first
[2:57:29] breath tonight?
[2:57:33] It doesn't do you any good to keep
[2:57:36] laying down that first breath
[2:57:38] &gt;&gt; over and over again.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Why don't you take a breath,
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; a different breath?
[2:57:46] You can do that right where you're
[2:57:48] sitting. Say, "Lord, I want this breath.
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; I want to breathe it in.
[2:57:59] I can't have it schooled into me.
[2:58:02] I can't come up with the formula. I've
[2:58:05] repented. I've been baptized in the name
[2:58:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ. You said I
[2:58:10] shall receive
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; this breath of life.
[2:58:15] And here I am. Father, I need a revival.
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; Lord, that was just for me tonight.
[2:58:23] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for anybody in this
[2:58:25] building, Father, it was for me.
[2:58:30] Give me that second breath that I'll
[2:58:33] keep going.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; I'll keep preaching.
[2:58:37] &gt;&gt; I'll keep traveling. I'll quit keep
[2:58:40] talking to to souls.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; I'll do all that I can.
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; For the kingdom of God.
[2:58:49] &gt;&gt; Say that to yourself tonight.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; Encourage yourself
[2:58:55] in the Lord. Don't look at that old man.
[2:58:58] He's not looking at it.
[2:59:01] He's looking at you for who you really
[2:59:03] are. And he wants to give you that
[2:59:06] breath
[2:59:09] of life.
[2:59:14] You know our theme song is
[2:59:17] only believe
[2:59:20] all things are possible.
[2:59:23] Do you believe all things are possible
[2:59:25] tonight?
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; I am tired of Satan keep running us down
[2:59:35] and pointing out our past.
[2:59:39] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of him accusing
[2:59:44] the elect. Yeah.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; I told Mike, I said today, I said, "I
[2:59:50] I'm going to preach a message called
[2:59:53] Faith in the Accusation."
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; Why do you believe what he said?
[3:00:00] &gt;&gt; Every day he's going to tell you,
[3:00:02] "You're no good.
[3:00:04] &gt;&gt; You're rotten. You're worthless. You're
[3:00:07] a sinner. You're a failure. You never do
[3:00:11] nothing right. You're just God doesn't
[3:00:14] love you. You're terrible.
[3:00:20] Now, how many believe that's the truth?
[3:00:23] &gt;&gt; I don't.
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; I know I was a scoundrel.
[3:00:29] &gt;&gt; I know I am still a scoundrel.
[3:00:33] But I know he put my name
[3:00:35] &gt;&gt; on the lamb's book of life
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. And
[3:00:40] I know that he promised to bring me
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; into what he prophesied of me,
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; which is a victorious son of God.
[3:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:00:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I need a breath
[3:00:54] of life
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; to make that real to me again.
[3:00:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Go back
[3:01:05] to the first place you ever met him.
[3:01:11] the first time that he ever talked to
[3:01:13] you
[3:01:15] and dealt with you.
[3:01:19] Mine was a rooftop.
[3:01:25] I've talked to hundreds of Christians
[3:01:27] and heard their testimonies. Matthew was
[3:01:30] alone
[3:01:32] one day in a truck
[3:01:35] and Satan said, "You're just going to go
[3:01:38] back to that television anyway."
[3:01:41] He come running through the door and
[3:01:44] said, "I'm going to kill you."
[3:01:48] We thought he was going to kill David.
[3:01:51] Me and Lesie flew out of our bed. Down
[3:01:54] the hall we went and we thought
[3:01:57] Matthew's going to go kill
[3:01:59] Davey,
[3:02:01] what had he done this time?
[3:02:05] And all we heard, we heard spash, bang,
[3:02:08] everything.
[3:02:10] He finally was done with listening to
[3:02:14] Satan.
[3:02:16] And he grabbed a big pull of bolt
[3:02:18] cutters and went out there and took a
[3:02:21] television, wherever it was, and smashed
[3:02:24] it to pieces.
[3:02:27] You want to sp smash your accuser
[3:02:30] tonight.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; That's what our brother's talking about.
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; Getting a breath of life in you.
[3:02:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:02:38] &gt;&gt; That smashes your accuser.
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; And you don't listen to him no more.
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; He's a liar.
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; He's the father of all lies.
[3:02:50] &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags.
[3:02:53] There's nothing we can ever do to
[3:02:57] deserve it.
[3:02:58] &gt;&gt; Alls we can do is accept it.
[3:03:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm asking you tonight, do you
[3:03:06] believe
[3:03:09] he's got a
[3:03:12] second wind for you?
[3:03:18] Do you believe he knows you? He knows
[3:03:21] all about you. He knows every thought,
[3:03:24] everything you ever did. And all he's
[3:03:27] saying here tonight is let me breathe
[3:03:31] on you.
[3:03:34] That's what we need to do is open our
[3:03:36] hearts.
[3:03:38] Say, Lord, I need a revival.
[3:03:43] I need to freshen my bornag again
[3:03:46] experience.
[3:03:48] I need to apply the token to my life.
[3:03:53] I need to give my all. And I'm here to
[3:03:56] rededicate myself.
[3:03:58] I'm here to receive your breath. Breathe
[3:04:02] on me,
[3:04:04] Lord.
[3:04:06] I'm predestinated and chosen for your
[3:04:10] breath.
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; You already got it.
[3:04:19] He's
[3:04:21] You think he knows?
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; All right. How many believes the Lord
[3:04:32] can breathe
[3:04:33] &gt;&gt; on our sister's prayer request
[3:04:37] &gt;&gt; and make it live?
[3:04:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul right here, his wife had a
[3:04:43] friend whose child had leukemia.
[3:04:48] All of a sudden, he got stirred up
[3:04:51] sitting at home. I'm going to go pray
[3:04:53] for her. He went over to the hospital
[3:04:57] where they said there's no more medicine
[3:04:59] to help her. There's nothing that she
[3:05:02] can do. Six years old, Paul,
[3:05:05] &gt;&gt; six years of age. He went there and laid
[3:05:08] his hands on her.
[3:05:12] Three weeks later, he gets a phone call.
[3:05:14] There's no leukemia anywhere.
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody came and breathed.
[3:05:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; somebody came and breathed.
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; Paul believed what he said. All things
[3:05:26] are possible to them that what? Believe.
[3:05:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you can have a second
[3:05:33] breath?
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; You believe your life can come back on
[3:05:36] fire for God? Do you believe that that
[3:05:40] all everything that's laid to your
[3:05:42] charge is wiped away? That you never did
[3:05:46] it in the first place?
[3:05:51] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[3:05:53] &gt;&gt; That's who we are.
[3:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; We're the redeemed.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:01] &gt;&gt; Let's get the religion out and let's get
[3:06:03] the life back in.
[3:06:09] Jesus.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; You know, I just got a song because I I
[3:06:15] I I want us to be victorious.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; I want us to claim it.
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; I want us to believe in one another.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; I thought, you know, this has been my
[3:06:32] heart for the since January. has been a
[3:06:35] path forward.
[3:06:37] I thought, what a path
[3:06:40] that's been opened up to us.
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; A new heart.
[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; A new breath.
[3:06:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; A new life.
[3:06:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:07:02] He's our Lord God.
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; Jehovah.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; It's that song. You know, goes
[3:07:12] about taking our Egypt,
[3:07:16] possessing our Egypt. Do you know that
[3:07:18] song?
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he'll bring you out of
[3:07:23] where you are?
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:07:24] &gt;&gt; Our brother preached it.
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:07:30] I mean, we can do an altar call and
[3:07:32] everybody can come to the altar and we
[3:07:35] can go through the same sorrow and the
[3:07:38] same repentance
[3:07:41] and come up. I'm a sinner. I'm no good.
[3:07:44] Lord, fill me. Lord, change me.
[3:07:52] And you can go through that cycle
[3:07:55] over and over
[3:07:58] and over again.
[3:08:03] I don't want to do that anymore.
[3:08:09] I want life.
[3:08:13] &gt;&gt; I want him to breathe on me.
[3:08:16] &gt;&gt; I want to lay yesterday down.
[3:08:21] and breathe
[3:08:23] aresh.
[3:08:27] Do you believe whatever our sister is
[3:08:30] asking for God can do?
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:36] &gt;&gt; She believes it.
[3:08:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:08:40] I could lay hands on everyone here,
[3:08:45] but if they didn't believe
[3:08:49] if they didn't accept this word, if they
[3:08:52] didn't accept their forgiveness,
[3:08:56] they get up and they
[3:09:00] tired of that.
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; I want a new life.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:09:09] I give you what you ask for.
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; Your sins are remitted.
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[3:09:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:09:29] &gt;&gt; He said the life of Christ
[3:09:32] &gt;&gt; was in them. whose sins you remit, they
[3:09:36] are remitted.
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; They said the Catholic priest took that
[3:09:41] and made it carnal.
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; But he said what it was was the divine
[3:09:46] revelation of the word of God. Why are
[3:09:50] your sins remitted? Because you never
[3:09:55] did it
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; in THE FIRST PLACE.
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[3:10:05] He has no hold on you.
[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; He has no claim on you.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:10:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, give me that breath.
[3:10:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:10:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:14] &gt;&gt; To receive that revelation.
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; Give me that breath that all things are
[3:10:19] possible.
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; That's the breath of life we want.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; Soldiers,
[3:10:25] how does that song help me sing? I won't
[3:10:29] forget
[3:10:31] the wonders of my
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; You remember that
[3:10:44] you found me
[3:10:48] back the waters
[3:10:53] Oh,
[3:10:58] you're the God who fights for me
[3:11:03] victory.
[3:11:05] Hallelujah.
[3:11:09] Hallelu.
[3:11:13] You have to
[3:11:15] see. You have me through the hallelujah.
[3:11:24] Hallelujah.
[3:11:29] A cloud by me is a sign that you are
[3:11:34] with me.
[3:11:36] The fire by night is a guiding light to
[3:11:41] my feet.
[3:11:44] You found me. You free me. Help the
[3:11:49] waters for my relief.
[3:11:52] Oh yeah.
[3:12:08] Heat.
[3:12:14] Sing
[3:12:19] hallelujah.
[3:12:23] Hallelu.
[3:12:28] A cloud by day is a sign that you are
[3:12:33] with me.
[3:12:35] The fire by night is a guiding light to
[3:12:40] my fear.
[3:12:43] You found me. You're freeing
[3:12:47] like the water.
[3:13:01] Heat.
[3:13:10] Heat.
[3:13:21] Hallelu.
[3:13:25] You step into my
[3:13:29] You took me all the way.
[3:13:32] You lost me out in freedom
[3:13:36] into the promised land.
[3:13:39] Now I will not forget you. I sing of all
[3:13:44] you
[3:13:46] make me smile forever.
[3:13:50] Hallelujah.
[3:13:54] Your son
[3:14:12] We are not defeated.
[3:14:24] Heat. Heat.
[3:14:35] Heat. Heat.
[3:14:57] Take that new breath.
[3:14:59] Take that new breath.
[3:15:02] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[3:15:12] Hallelujah.
[3:15:16] Hallelu.
[3:15:19] Oh, you're the kind of price for me
[3:15:25] victory.
[3:15:30] Hallelujah.
[3:15:33] You have brought a prophecy
[3:15:39] to the king. Hallelujah.
[3:15:44] Hallelujah.
[3:15:47] Amen.
[3:15:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:50] &gt;&gt; Ah, do you believe he's fighting for
[3:15:52] you?
[3:15:54] &gt;&gt; You know he's not going to lose a one.
[3:16:02] &gt;&gt; We need to have victory
[3:16:04] &gt;&gt; in our lives.
[3:16:08] &gt;&gt; It's not the picture that Satan draws.
[3:16:13] &gt;&gt; That's reality.
[3:16:15] It's what God said
[3:16:18] &gt;&gt; is reality.
[3:16:23] &gt;&gt; Satan says you're sick.
[3:16:27] &gt;&gt; The doctor told me you've got a
[3:16:32] non-contagious
[3:16:36] chest infection.
[3:16:42] Whatever you do, just lay down
[3:16:46] for a few days.
[3:16:48] Don't get up
[3:16:50] and drink lots of water.
[3:16:53] &gt;&gt; I wasn't ready for that breath. My
[3:16:56] &gt;&gt; I was ready for this breath.
[3:16:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:17:03] &gt;&gt; Satan said, "You go up there, you're
[3:17:05] going to start coughing." Well, Satan, I
[3:17:08] ain't going to stop. I'll I'll cough and
[3:17:10] praise God.
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; G.
[3:17:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; We've got to get rid of the negativity.
[3:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:17:21] &gt;&gt; Never.
[3:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:17:24] &gt;&gt; Never.
[3:17:25] &gt;&gt; Never.
[3:17:26] &gt;&gt; Never have a negative thought.
[3:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hey,
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; we've been loathing
[3:17:38] ourselves for too long.
[3:17:44] &gt;&gt; David had a lot of reason
[3:17:48] to look back,
[3:17:50] but he accepted
[3:17:52] &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord.
[3:17:58] He accepted
[3:18:00] his pardon.
[3:18:07] &gt;&gt; Do you accept your pardon tonight?
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; You can either look back
[3:18:16] or you can take a breath tonight.
[3:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; You can go home and apply the token.
[3:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:26] You can go to that closet and throw out
[3:18:28] the high heels,
[3:18:30] throw out the makeup, throw out the
[3:18:33] jewelry.
[3:18:33] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[3:18:34] &gt;&gt; throw out the scissors.
[3:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:18:36] &gt;&gt; You can go home tonight, throw down your
[3:18:39] games.
[3:18:42] &gt;&gt; Get rid of your whatever you have on
[3:18:46] your machines, I guess, computers,
[3:18:49] whatever's there.
[3:18:51] You say, "How am I going to do that?" By
[3:18:54] the breath,
[3:18:56] &gt;&gt; by the new breath,
[3:18:58] &gt;&gt; that he's going to breathe into me.
[3:19:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe you can put a breath in
[3:19:03] me tonight
[3:19:05] &gt;&gt; to make me victorious.
[3:19:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:19:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "When's he going to give it to
[3:19:10] you?
[3:19:13] Today?
[3:19:15] Tomorrow?
[3:19:17] &gt;&gt; The next day?"
[3:19:20] &gt;&gt; It's not a one-time breath.
[3:19:23] The same natural breath that keeps you
[3:19:26] alive is the same spiritual breath
[3:19:29] &gt;&gt; that keeps you alive.
[3:19:30] &gt;&gt; Read your Bibles,
[3:19:33] &gt;&gt; pray,
[3:19:34] &gt;&gt; listen
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[3:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:39] &gt;&gt; And live.
[3:19:43] &gt;&gt; Are you ready to live?
[3:19:46] &gt;&gt; Is victory yours?
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; Can you sing, Victory is mine? Amen.
[3:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:56] &gt;&gt; And these people are coming to the altar
[3:19:58] because they know there's a God.
[3:19:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:20:00] &gt;&gt; That'll hear their prayer.
[3:20:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:20:02] &gt;&gt; Will you join your faith
[3:20:06] &gt;&gt; with their request?
[3:20:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:20:15] &gt;&gt; I know what God can do.
[3:20:17] &gt;&gt; I can't even testify, brother Matt, how
[3:20:20] dark I was.
[3:20:23] But you know something?
[3:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's not how he looked at me.
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; He looked at me through the blood.
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; He looks at you tonight
[3:20:34] through his blood.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to walk out here a sinner.
[3:20:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk out here delivered.
[3:20:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk out here. So, Lord, I
[3:20:44] don't know where you want me to do. I
[3:20:47] don't know what direction I'm going to.
[3:20:50] I just know I want to go forward.
[3:20:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm trusting that this breath that
[3:20:55] my brother spoke about
[3:20:57] &gt;&gt; will lead me.
[3:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:00] &gt;&gt; It'll put enthusiasm in me.
[3:21:03] &gt;&gt; It'll speak to me.
[3:21:05] &gt;&gt; It'll convict me of sin.
[3:21:08] &gt;&gt; It'll reveal the word to me.
[3:21:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to live by the natural
[3:21:13] man.
[3:21:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to live by every promise.
[3:21:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:21:17] &gt;&gt; In the book. Hallelujah.
[3:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:21:22] &gt;&gt; I like he addressed that message to
[3:21:25] Christian Life Tabernacle tonight.
[3:21:28] &gt;&gt; Our visitors, whatever choice
[3:21:32] you make.
[3:21:34] &gt;&gt; But as for me in my house,
[3:21:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to serve the Lord.
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; I want new life.
[3:21:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:21:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:21:45] &gt;&gt; To serve the Lord. Brother Billy, would
[3:21:47] you help me sing that? I tonight, I
[3:21:50] believe that victory
[3:21:53] is mine. Amen.
[3:21:54] &gt;&gt; I believe every person that's at this
[3:21:57] altar has already been promised
[3:22:02] &gt;&gt; by predestination.
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; Victory.
[3:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:08] &gt;&gt; I believe they'll rise up and because
[3:22:11] they made this trip to the altar that
[3:22:14] God's going to start ordering their
[3:22:16] footsteps in their life.
[3:22:18] &gt;&gt; They're going to start putting the
[3:22:19] puzzle together. He's going to start
[3:22:21] leading them and guiding them
[3:22:26] and they're going to find themselves
[3:22:29] in the joy of the Lord
[3:22:32] &gt;&gt; cuz victory is there.
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:22:36] &gt;&gt; He's not going to lose
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; a one. Amen.
[3:22:42] &gt;&gt; I I believe that
[3:22:49] &gt;&gt; the bride of Christ.
[3:22:52] &gt;&gt; Saints of the living God. Do what our
[3:22:54] brother said.
[3:22:56] &gt;&gt; Give your all.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I woke up this morning. I hope
[3:23:01] tomorrow this song is on your heart. Oh,
[3:23:05] when I woke up this morning, I didn't
[3:23:10] have a doubt. And I knew that the Lord
[3:23:14] would bring me out.
[3:23:17] So I got down on my knees. I pray, Lord,
[3:23:22] help me. This is the part my God. I
[3:23:25] sing.
[3:23:30] Oh, victory is
[3:23:33] victory.
[3:23:36] Oh, victory.
[3:23:41] Claim somebody. Put somebody on your
[3:23:44] heart. Say, they're going to get the
[3:23:46] victory. They're going to get their
[3:23:48] healing. They're going to get their
[3:23:50] deliverance. Speak out the word.
[3:23:52] Hallelujah.
[3:23:56] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[3:24:06] Heat.
[3:24:12] Heat.
[3:24:22] Oh Jesus.
[3:24:52] Yes.
[3:24:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's about time we tell him to take
[3:25:00] a hike.
[3:25:02] Praise God.
[3:25:08] Oh,
[3:25:13] today
[3:25:17] I
[3:25:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:25:30] Tonight,
[3:25:36] &gt;&gt; don't Listen
[3:25:39] to the liar.
[3:25:44] &gt;&gt; Do not have faith
[3:25:46] in the accusation.
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; Satan is an accuser of the brethren.
[3:25:54] Seeking whom he may devour.
[3:25:57] Remember, he can't lay anything to your
[3:26:01] charge because the blood of Jesus Christ
[3:26:05] &gt;&gt; has cleansed you
[3:26:07] &gt;&gt; and he has given you
[3:26:11] his spirit.
[3:26:15] &gt;&gt; Satan is not going to admit you've got
[3:26:18] the spirit of God.
[3:26:22] &gt;&gt; You can let your hair grow long. He'll
[3:26:24] say you're a hypocrite. You can let your
[3:26:27] dresses, you can get rid of the makeup,
[3:26:29] you can apply the token into your life.
[3:26:31] He's never going to admit that you're
[3:26:35] born again.
[3:26:37] &gt;&gt; So, if you're looking for him,
[3:26:39] &gt;&gt; come on,
[3:26:39] &gt;&gt; to give you some sort of star of
[3:26:43] approval,
[3:26:45] &gt;&gt; forget it.
[3:26:48] &gt;&gt; I have news for you. Satan
[3:26:51] hates you.
[3:26:52] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[3:26:56] And he's not going to quit tempting you.
[3:27:00] &gt;&gt; He's not going to quit lying to you.
[3:27:03] He's not going to try to quit deceiving
[3:27:06] you. All you need is a second
[3:27:12] wind.
[3:27:15] &gt;&gt; Take a deep breath. Says, "Satan,
[3:27:19] &gt;&gt; I'm done."
[3:27:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:27:21] &gt;&gt; With you.
[3:27:26] I'm done with you.
[3:27:30] &gt;&gt; You lie. You cheat. There's no good
[3:27:34] thing in you.
[3:27:37] I You've casted your vote
[3:27:41] against me. Jesus Christ has casted his
[3:27:44] vote for me.
[3:27:47] &gt;&gt; Now,
[3:27:49] &gt;&gt; who you going to believe?
[3:27:51] God who said you're clean,
[3:27:54] &gt;&gt; you never did it in the first place,
[3:27:56] &gt;&gt; who revealed the word of God for you for
[3:27:59] the hour.
[3:28:00] &gt;&gt; Or are you going to believe the liar?
[3:28:04] &gt;&gt; If you start believing him, he'll drive
[3:28:06] you crazy.
[3:28:12] &gt;&gt; I believe this.
[3:28:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go forward. Let's come back
[3:28:17] tomorrow, believers.
[3:28:21] ready to receive instruction,
[3:28:24] &gt;&gt; to listen and hear
[3:28:28] and take a new path forward
[3:28:31] in his name.
[3:28:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. We have food.
[3:28:37] Some of it might be leftover from this
[3:28:39] afternoon, but leftovers are pretty good
[3:28:42] if you're hungry.
[3:28:45] Amen.
[3:28:47] &gt;&gt; They've been preaching this gospel for
[3:28:48] 2,000 years and it filled my soul
[3:28:51] tonight.
[3:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:28:56] &gt;&gt; It's life.
[3:28:58] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to ask a blessing on the
[3:29:00] food. They'll have something.
[3:29:01] Sandwiches,
[3:29:03] uh maybe a piece of meat and a piece of
[3:29:06] bread, maybe one or two noodles, a
[3:29:09] couple beans. We don't care. Where
[3:29:12] there's any, there's plenty.
[3:29:15] &gt;&gt; And and if, buts, and wise are all
[3:29:19] Satan's lies. Let's bow our heads. Let's
[3:29:22] walk away from this building tonight
[3:29:25] believing who we are,
[3:29:27] &gt;&gt; the redeemed and purchased of the Lord
[3:29:30] Jesus Christ. Let us pray. our heavenly
[3:29:34] father.
[3:29:39] Lord, though you rebuked me tonight
[3:29:42] and you chassened me, Father,
[3:29:53] Father, I'm thankful
[3:29:57] that you spoke to my heart and said that
[3:30:00] I could have new life. I could have new
[3:30:03] vigor. I could have new energy. I can
[3:30:08] have new leadership. I can have new
[3:30:11] direction.
[3:30:13] No matter how bumpy the road, you're
[3:30:15] going to take me all the way down it
[3:30:18] until you put me back on the path that
[3:30:22] you want me.
[3:30:24] I'm going to take that breath.
[3:30:28] I'm going to breathe it in.
[3:30:30] It can't be schooled.
[3:30:32] It can only be God-given.
[3:30:35] And I believe, Father, you gave the
[3:30:38] opportunity to me personally tonight.
[3:30:41] I hope each believer here
[3:30:44] will leave those things which are behind
[3:30:47] behind
[3:30:48] and press to the higher mark in the
[3:30:52] higher calling in Christ Jesus. Thank
[3:30:56] you, Father, for touching these hearts
[3:30:58] that came to the altar to giving victory
[3:31:02] and and Lord, let the possibility reign
[3:31:06] in our hearts that all things are
[3:31:08] possible. We love you. We thank you. We
[3:31:12] ask you to bless our food, bless our
[3:31:15] fellowship.
[3:31:17] Father, place within us a positive
[3:31:19] heart,
[3:31:21] encouraging ourselves in the Lord with a
[3:31:24] word of praise on our lips. We believe
[3:31:27] it and we say, "Amen." God bless you
[3:31:30] tonight. Go in peace. Amen. Amen. What's
[3:31:36] that song like? Let's sing joyous.
[3:31:41] Amen. How many believe Joy is the flag?
[3:31:44] Hallelujah. Let's sing it.
[3:31:47] &gt;&gt; Joy is the flag on high from the castle
[3:31:52] of my heart. From the castle of my
