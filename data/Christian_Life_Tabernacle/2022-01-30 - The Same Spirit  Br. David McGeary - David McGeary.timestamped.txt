[0:06] [Music]
[0:09] surrendering
[0:10] my
[0:15] [Music]
[0:24] earth
[0:29] [Music]
[0:38] us remembering
[0:43] [Music]
[0:53] oh
[0:56] [Music]
[1:05] [Music]
[1:16] this is
[1:29] [Music]
[1:49] our gracious father
[1:52] to surrender to you fathers to surrender
[1:55] to your word
[1:57] father we ask that you bless those that
[1:59] have come out tonight to
[2:02] fellowship around
[2:05] your word father to make the sacrifice
[2:08] to
[2:11] come right back to the house of the lord
[2:14] we ask that you give them a special
[2:16] blessing for their effort
[2:19] father bless your word to us this
[2:21] evening we pray
[2:23] in jesus precious
[2:25] and wonderful and holy name amen amen
[2:29] god bless you tonight
[2:30] uh
[2:31] just a few of us out to the house of the
[2:33] lord but that's usually
[2:35] the cream of the crop
[2:38] amen and you can make butter out of
[2:40] cream amen
[2:42] and cakes and cookies and
[2:44] all that stuff i can't eat anymore
[2:47] so but we just want to fellowship around
[2:49] the word just kind of look at a few
[2:50] scriptures and
[2:52] and
[2:55] point out
[2:57] a few things and i found the scripture i
[3:00] was looking for this morning so i'd like
[3:02] to
[3:02] use it as a text
[3:05] if
[3:06] we could
[3:07] and it's found in second corinthians the
[3:10] third chapter so let's turn to second
[3:12] corinthians the third chapter
[3:15] and uh read there
[3:18] and and i think this is a great
[3:21] uh a scripture and a great chapter we're
[3:24] gonna stop
[3:26] um
[3:27] at a certain point but if you go into it
[3:30] uh
[3:32] paul goes on to explain the
[3:34] the glory of the law versus the glory
[3:38] of the spirit that we we're going to
[3:39] stop at a
[3:41] a place right here after the sixth verse
[3:44] and he says now he says
[3:47] do we begin again
[3:50] to condemn ourselves
[3:53] or need we
[3:55] as some others
[3:57] epistles of condemnation to you
[4:01] or letters of condemnation from you
[4:05] ye are our epistles
[4:09] written in our hearts
[4:12] known
[4:13] and read of all men
[4:16] so paul never there was pointing to
[4:20] anything other than life
[4:23] as being the representation of what that
[4:27] he taught
[4:28] so he's not saying you're not reading it
[4:30] in a letter you're not reading it here
[4:32] but you are living
[4:34] what i preached and therefore
[4:37] that's life and so he says
[4:40] ye are our epistles
[4:42] written in our hearts known and read of
[4:45] all men
[4:47] for as much as ye are manifestly
[4:52] declared to be the epistle
[4:55] of christ
[4:56] ministered by us
[4:59] i like that word don't you manifestly in
[5:02] other words it showed up it manifested
[5:04] it was real
[5:06] people see you they see what we teach
[5:09] they see you they see what we believe
[5:12] they see you they see what we stand for
[5:15] boy don't you hope that we can do that
[5:17] for our messenger
[5:19] amen
[5:21] and he says ministered by us written not
[5:25] with ink
[5:27] but with the spirit
[5:30] of the living god
[5:33] that's the part we want to just
[5:35] fellowship about the epistle wasn't
[5:37] written with ink
[5:39] it was written by the spirit of the
[5:43] living god
[5:45] not
[5:46] in tablets of stone
[5:49] or we could say not in books
[5:53] you you understand there are on the
[5:55] bookshelf in the
[5:58] in the christian bookstore
[6:00] he says not written on tablets of stone
[6:03] but in fleshly tabernacles
[6:07] of the heart
[6:09] and
[6:11] such trust have we
[6:14] through christ
[6:15] to godward
[6:18] amen that's the trust that we have in
[6:21] christ
[6:22] is that by his spirit he's writing this
[6:25] word on the tablets of your heart and
[6:28] manifesting it
[6:30] to where that you become
[6:33] written epistles
[6:35] read of all men that men by looking at
[6:38] you in the flesh conceit what god has
[6:42] written
[6:43] amen
[6:45] and not that we are sufficient of
[6:48] ourselves to think anything of ourselves
[6:53] but our suff
[6:55] our sufficiency is of god
[6:58] who hath made us
[7:00] able ministers of the new testament
[7:04] not of the letter
[7:07] but of the spirit
[7:09] for the letter killeth but the spirit
[7:13] giveth life
[7:15] amen father bless your word and your
[7:17] precious name we pray amen god bless you
[7:20] may be seated
[7:23] so well so we're we're talking about and
[7:26] and and i don't really have a title
[7:29] for our sermon but
[7:32] my thought to you is simply
[7:34] let's
[7:35] not let the message become letter
[7:41] you know not letting the word become
[7:45] letter
[7:46] and so that's what our our our thought
[7:50] is i'd like to read this statement that
[7:52] the prophet of god made
[7:55] in the message the world's falling apart
[7:59] he says there's only one thing
[8:01] that ever did begin
[8:04] that
[8:04] never did begin there's only one thing
[8:08] that never did begin
[8:10] and that was god
[8:13] therefore the only way we can ever live
[8:17] eternally is to have god's own life in
[8:22] us
[8:24] and that's eternal life
[8:28] because the only way that you can have
[8:31] eternal you can't get eternal life from
[8:34] any other source than something that
[8:37] always was eternal
[8:39] because anything that has a beginning
[8:41] will have an end
[8:43] and the only thing that didn't have
[8:46] a beginning was god
[8:48] and god expressed himself in his word
[8:52] and the word was god
[8:54] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[8:57] among us therefore
[8:59] that was a great promise so jesus knew
[9:02] he had that life in him
[9:04] so he knew that he that he could lay his
[9:08] life down and take it up again because
[9:11] he had something inside of him that he
[9:15] knew could take it up again
[9:17] and that's why paul gives us the great
[9:19] hope he says if the same spirit that
[9:23] dwelt in jesus christ dwell in you it
[9:26] will also do for you what it did for him
[9:31] amen it will also quicken your mortal
[9:33] body
[9:34] so you don't have to worry if you have
[9:36] that spirit in you and you have that
[9:38] life in you and you're a possessor of
[9:41] that life then you know that that life
[9:44] only has one end
[9:46] and the end of that is to live forever
[9:50] because that can't die
[9:52] oh and then we we could just go on and
[9:55] on into how we were in that word and how
[9:57] we're in a part of that world and that's
[9:59] why he could write our name on the
[10:01] lamb's book of life and nothing could
[10:04] put it on or nothing could take it off
[10:06] because of the great eternal part of god
[10:09] but what we're dealing with now because
[10:12] we're dealing with us possessing
[10:16] a weapon
[10:18] that
[10:19] can
[10:21] withstand
[10:23] the enemy in our day
[10:25] because we're in a battle life is a
[10:28] constant warfare
[10:30] and and
[10:31] if satan can't make the word of god none
[10:34] effect he'll make you of none effect
[10:38] has no man lighteth a candle and put it
[10:41] under a bushel basket but he likes the
[10:44] candle that that light might shine
[10:47] and and that many might find the way so
[10:52] he said in another place you are the
[10:53] salt of the earth
[10:55] if you lose your savor or if you lose
[10:58] your attraction because you you are down
[11:01] trodden and and then you you have no joy
[11:05] in your heart and you're
[11:07] you just kind of life has just got you
[11:09] so burdened or you've got so consumed
[11:12] with your own problems that
[11:14] that it forces you into your own little
[11:17] world and
[11:20] and that's what satan tries to do if he
[11:22] can't make the word of none effect he'll
[11:24] make you have none of that
[11:26] and we and we want to be effectual we
[11:29] want to have the effectual working
[11:31] of the gospel
[11:33] in our lives that's what we want to do
[11:35] we want to be written epistles read of
[11:38] all men so paul said i didn't come here
[11:41] to minister the letter
[11:44] you know not of the letter
[11:46] so he wants he's talking about something
[11:49] else that's greater
[11:51] than the letter so he said
[11:54] he says the only way god's own life in
[11:57] us eternal life
[11:58] god separated himself among us and gave
[12:01] us his spirit like he did on pentecost
[12:06] and was seen seen in the symbols of fire
[12:10] from the pillar of fire
[12:12] and it separated itself among the people
[12:16] to give his own life out out to
[12:20] the people and through this
[12:23] the mind of christ should be operating
[12:27] among us
[12:29] through this
[12:30] the mind of christ should be operating
[12:34] through us so we understood this morning
[12:37] by the word of god
[12:39] that satan is battling
[12:41] for our minds
[12:43] because if and we touched on a little
[12:46] bit
[12:47] that
[12:48] that reasoning is contagious
[12:51] so if if if we become the oracles not of
[12:55] god
[12:56] but of the article or oracles of satan
[12:59] whether it is doubt or
[13:02] or or or whether it is a confusion
[13:07] or disbelief or even
[13:09] our own uh
[13:13] lack of understanding
[13:15] if if
[13:16] if we speak and we
[13:18] we we talk and we express thoughts that
[13:21] aren't the mind of god then really we're
[13:24] preaching his gospel
[13:27] and certainly we don't want to be
[13:29] ministers of his
[13:31] gospel
[13:32] and we don't want our lives to minister
[13:35] of of his gospel
[13:38] and so we understand that that that's
[13:40] what it should come down to
[13:43] and through this
[13:45] in other words through god
[13:49] departing his spirit
[13:52] into his children through this one way
[13:56] this one way that god has
[13:59] the one way that he has to make us able
[14:02] ministers the one way he has to make us
[14:06] written epistles there's only one way
[14:09] that god has
[14:10] and that's the imparting of his spirit
[14:14] his life being imparted to the people
[14:19] and through this the mind of christ
[14:22] should be operating among us so the only
[14:25] way the mind of christ is going to be
[14:27] operating through us is by his spirit
[14:33] the only thing that interferes with that
[14:36] is our mind
[14:41] and that's why you know okay you can
[14:43] preach the gospel forever one of the
[14:45] hardest things it'll ever be to get the
[14:48] people to do is wait on the lord
[14:51] i am not a good waiter
[14:55] and i don't mean serving food
[14:58] i mean i i set a goal and i press and i
[15:02] push that might be the irish in me i
[15:05] don't know what it is i'm a fighter for
[15:08] causes it's just though the way that we
[15:10] have it through it all you've got to
[15:12] know that everything's in god's timing
[15:15] and his place and and he'll get it done
[15:19] but i believe he loves to see your heart
[15:21] but anyway it's by this way that the
[15:25] mind of god operates amongst us
[15:28] so there's no other way
[15:30] so if we just want to go back a little
[15:32] bit this morning touch on a few
[15:34] scriptures
[15:35] and just have a time
[15:38] in the lord and so we we talked this
[15:41] morning that that
[15:42] we know there's an enemy and he's
[15:44] fighting for our mind
[15:46] and he says he says
[15:49] he says and you must be trained
[15:52] when you meet him he's talking about the
[15:54] devil
[15:55] you got to be trained when you meet the
[15:57] devil well the first train if you have
[16:00] to have is what we had this morning you
[16:02] got to know what your weapon is
[16:05] now he's studying all your tactics right
[16:09] he knows that
[16:11] if you're a christian
[16:13] the first thing you're going to throw to
[16:15] him is the what
[16:17] the word
[16:19] and you notice this morning when eve
[16:21] said he said
[16:23] he didn't stop there
[16:25] he kept shooting and shooting and
[16:28] shooting and trying to find a hole
[16:31] trying to create a reasoning trying to
[16:33] create a doubt that's why our messenger
[16:35] told us this morning he says something
[16:37] he oh there is no holy spirit well okay
[16:40] you're an unbeliever you know okay it's
[16:42] not for you it's for me and you keep on
[16:45] going even when the children of israel
[16:49] were coming out of egypt but represented
[16:51] the bondage of sin the word of god by
[16:54] promise coming to them taking them to a
[16:57] journey to a promised land the one thing
[16:59] he told me to do is don't stop along the
[17:02] way don't fight with them don't fuss
[17:04] with them if what did they do if they
[17:07] ended up arguing with them and fussing
[17:09] with them and ended up marrying them and
[17:11] they got all involved with them along
[17:14] the way
[17:15] and that's what satan wants us to do he
[17:17] wants us to forget that we're on a
[17:19] journey we're just strangers he'll we're
[17:22] priggling strangers we're just traveling
[17:24] through this world is not my home i'm a
[17:27] just traveling through
[17:30] it's hard to do that
[17:34] because there's so many enticing things
[17:37] along the way to get us to stop
[17:40] and that's what he said he said he
[17:43] actually makes
[17:46] reason
[17:47] appealing
[17:50] and there's he's trying to give value
[17:52] to his lie
[17:54] and just remember this guy's motive
[17:57] his motive was to exalt himself
[18:01] above all the stars
[18:03] and to sit on the throne as god sits on
[18:07] the throne and to be worshiped
[18:09] that's what that's what he's after
[18:12] that's what he wants us to join in on
[18:14] that's what he's trying to get us to do
[18:16] is to enter into his temple
[18:20] and so we we see that he says not by
[18:23] psychology
[18:25] not trained in education
[18:28] or letter
[18:30] but trained by
[18:32] the holy spirit amen
[18:34] so this spirit that he's going to give
[18:37] us
[18:38] that is going to
[18:44] make us have his mind
[18:46] is the great tutor
[18:48] it's the tutor it's the trainer
[18:52] of us it's going to train us and many
[18:55] times we think well i get the holy
[18:57] spirit i'm filled with the spirit of god
[18:59] now i possess all power
[19:02] and all wisdom you know i'm going down
[19:04] to the hospital and i'm going to walk
[19:06] down the hallway and they're going to be
[19:08] coming out of their beds to all all over
[19:11] i'm going to meet every devil you know
[19:12] what i mean and just cast them out you
[19:14] know i mean all of a sudden you know
[19:18] i'm i'm all ready to go well you can put
[19:21] a 357 magnum in the hand of a
[19:24] three-year-old
[19:27] what do you think is going to happen
[19:30] someone's going to get shot something's
[19:32] going to get busted
[19:36] you know what i mean though he's got
[19:39] he's got to tutor us
[19:41] he's got to train us he's got to raise
[19:44] us up
[19:45] because he who is faithful in little
[19:48] is faithful and much
[19:50] i always love these guys i'm
[19:52] maybe i'll get on my soapbox for a few
[19:55] minutes all these guys they they they
[19:58] want to uh
[19:59] they want to have some sort of ministry
[20:01] they want to do something but when you
[20:03] ask them how many people have they led
[20:05] to the lord
[20:08] how many people have they sat through
[20:11] and prayed with
[20:12] and and watched the spirit of god come
[20:15] down at the end
[20:17] and convert them i mean are they so
[20:21] convinced they're concerned
[20:23] about the lost because real spirituality
[20:27] is evident in those that are concerned
[20:30] about the loss
[20:34] now i i i watched something last week
[20:37] that
[20:38] right before i left for my mother's
[20:40] house that really thrilled my heart and
[20:43] i don't believe the young man would mind
[20:45] me telling the testimony
[20:47] but
[20:49] i i was having some drywall work done in
[20:52] my bathroom at the house so
[20:55] i had brother gyrus come to do it
[20:58] and he brought his brother-in-law
[21:02] which would be his wife's
[21:05] brother
[21:06] and he came over and she asked me she
[21:09] said
[21:09] on the phone she said
[21:12] would you talk to him about the lord
[21:16] and i thought well what an admiral
[21:19] request you know
[21:20] and she
[21:21] proceeded to let me know
[21:25] how
[21:26] messed up he was
[21:28] you know he's smoking pot well
[21:31] i already know a god that can deliver
[21:33] from pods so that didn't shake me
[21:36] and and this you know and after that you
[21:38] know he didn't seem like as bad as cases
[21:41] she thought you know
[21:42] but if it just so happened
[21:45] that we sat down
[21:47] at the table
[21:48] and began to talk
[21:52] it and
[21:53] and you know a little bit of a testimony
[21:55] we begin to talk
[21:57] with them
[21:58] and and so here's a guy that knows about
[22:02] god
[22:03] but he's just not living it right
[22:06] and we begin to just fellowship and the
[22:08] spirit of god began to come around us
[22:11] and we we talked
[22:14] we talked about it
[22:16] and and i asked him i said well has
[22:19] anybody ever talked to you about the
[22:21] lord he said not like this
[22:25] you know and so we got done talking i
[22:27] said let's just pray together i said
[22:29] you've got to look down inside of you
[22:32] and see if there's something inside of
[22:35] you that's hearing the word of god
[22:37] and we prayed there and together and
[22:40] then i went on my trip and
[22:43] sure enough
[22:45] this morning
[22:46] he comes running up to me in the parking
[22:49] lot
[22:50] and the guy's just got a grin on his
[22:52] face
[22:52] and he says i'm in church
[22:57] and you can ask leslie he was so excited
[22:59] he says hey i'm here
[23:02] i'm in church
[23:05] this is
[23:06] awesome i really like this
[23:10] he said you know he said the prayer
[23:12] really helped
[23:14] amen
[23:18] and you know i
[23:20] i'm not saying that i had a great motive
[23:22] like oh i'm going to lead this guy to
[23:24] the lord
[23:26] you know his sister asked me to
[23:29] talk to him about the lord and i was
[23:31] standing around looking for the
[23:33] opportunity seeing it and somehow we
[23:35] just ended up at the table because they
[23:37] had to wait for the sheetrock to dry
[23:41] and we talked
[23:43] and it didn't appear nothing had
[23:45] happened
[23:47] but the word
[23:49] germinates the seed
[23:53] if that gene of god is in there
[23:57] then that word
[23:59] brings that gene to light that the gene
[24:02] of god where does the gene of god come
[24:04] you get like your father's gene right
[24:06] you i have the characteristics of my
[24:08] father if you saw pictures of my father
[24:11] you'd see pictures of me and vice versa
[24:13] and we could take this
[24:15] in all of our lives that we've got those
[24:17] natural virtues well those come from the
[24:20] genes of our parents
[24:22] the genetics well god's got a genetic
[24:27] and his genetic is his word
[24:30] that's the gene of god is the word in
[24:33] you and if and brother bran said if that
[24:35] word gets planted in the proper
[24:38] condition it'll come to life
[24:42] but the letter could kill that very
[24:46] person but the word of god the spirit of
[24:48] god brought it to life and so i was
[24:50] talking
[24:51] and he's really happy and he's excited
[24:54] him and he enjoyed the word and we know
[24:57] he think he understands that
[25:00] there's been battles to come
[25:03] but he tasted something that was greater
[25:06] than what he tasted before
[25:09] so if satan makes sin appealing
[25:13] how much more does god have to make his
[25:16] word appealing
[25:20] and that's what lets you know who you
[25:22] are is what what what appeals to you
[25:27] you know what what what draws you what's
[25:29] greater we're all tempted by sin we all
[25:32] make mistakes a man who says he hasn't
[25:34] sinned is a
[25:36] liar
[25:37] but we have someone that makes petition
[25:40] for us before the father and it covers
[25:43] our mistakes and trains us and teaches
[25:45] us look we've got to be trained
[25:48] and i just thought nice and i looked at
[25:50] him i said well i says
[25:52] i says i guess your sister can't be on
[25:54] your back anymore he says yeah that's
[25:57] one of the best parts of it
[26:02] but he was excited
[26:05] about what god did for him
[26:08] and and what was beautiful is you knew
[26:11] that it wasn't
[26:13] the letter wasn't ministered
[26:16] but life was minister
[26:19] and because life was ministered it
[26:22] turned into life
[26:25] okay and i'm anxious to see the great
[26:27] life
[26:28] that he'll have
[26:30] in the lord jesus
[26:32] the power to live through trials and
[26:34] tests and act and everything something
[26:37] that holds in the cliff of the storm
[26:40] it's a
[26:41] anchor in the rock you know it'll bring
[26:43] you through your mistakes it'll bring it
[26:45] through your failures it'll bring you
[26:47] through the things you regret that you
[26:49] never what you could do you can look
[26:52] back on your history and be ashamed but
[26:54] he only sees as far as the blood
[26:58] and it's beautiful so he says
[27:02] not trained
[27:03] but trained by the holy spirit god's
[27:06] power
[27:08] in his word
[27:10] so paul said here that i'm not a
[27:13] minister of the letter
[27:16] but of the spirit
[27:18] so i'm not a minister of the knowledge
[27:21] of the word
[27:24] or the truth
[27:26] of the word
[27:28] or of the doctrinal or
[27:31] dogma placing of the word of god
[27:35] what i'm ministering is the power
[27:38] of the word of god in other words what
[27:42] the word of god can do i'm not just not
[27:45] ministering what it is or what it was or
[27:50] or uh
[27:52] where it was in history and
[27:54] and everything and that's like us
[27:56] preaching about jesus yesterday
[27:59] well what good is jesus yesterday if
[28:01] he's not the same today
[28:06] and what good is it if we can't trust
[28:08] him for tomorrow
[28:09] so paul says he's the same yesterday
[28:12] today and forever
[28:14] he's the same
[28:16] look he's not ministering the letter we
[28:19] are not ministering
[28:21] malachi 4 5 as william branham
[28:25] have coming
[28:26] in the 60s and opening the seals
[28:29] that's not what we're ministering that's
[28:31] history
[28:32] but what we're ministering is what he
[28:35] restored
[28:40] that's what we're ministering we're
[28:42] ministering the the faith
[28:46] that was restored the faith of our
[28:48] fathers
[28:50] that was restored to bring them to the
[28:54] gate called beautiful and say silver and
[28:56] gold have i none but that which i have i
[29:00] will minister to you
[29:04] that's what we're talking about
[29:07] it isn't to get people to see
[29:10] that brother brandon was a prophet
[29:13] every tv commentator
[29:17] joyce myers
[29:19] teaches that william branham was a
[29:21] prophet
[29:25] and she obviously didn't get the power
[29:29] she got the power of the hair clippers
[29:35] and the paint
[29:38] and the jewelry
[29:42] and to be out of order
[29:48] you know what i call that don't you
[29:51] the power of jezebel
[29:55] who had the messenger's head cut off
[29:59] see that's
[30:00] not what we're ministering
[30:04] because if we just minister
[30:08] the fact that you need to accept
[30:12] william branham is the fulfillment of
[30:14] malachi 4 5 luke 17
[30:17] 30 revelations 10 7 and that he came in
[30:21] our day and he was elijah the prophet
[30:23] then you're ministering the letter
[30:29] satan believes that
[30:33] and he fears and trembles
[30:36] but so that's like
[30:38] admitting the guy walking up in the gray
[30:41] suit
[30:43] with the bag over his shoulder that your
[30:45] dog barks at is the mailman
[30:50] there goes the mailman that's the
[30:53] mailman
[30:54] he delivers the mail
[30:57] he's vindicated
[30:59] he's got a patch on his arm that says
[31:01] u.s mail
[31:03] he comes in the rain and the snow and
[31:05] the sunshine
[31:07] you know
[31:08] wind rain or snow he delivers the mail
[31:11] that's the mailman let me tell you about
[31:14] the mailman when the mailman started it
[31:17] started back when people moved to the
[31:19] west and they sent a pony back and forth
[31:22] and
[31:23] and they all can and he's the first pony
[31:26] express rider
[31:28] you know
[31:29] and all that stuff
[31:33] what good's the mailman if you never get
[31:35] any mail i don't care if the mailman
[31:37] ever comes to my house
[31:39] all he does is gives coupons for my wife
[31:42] to use to spend money
[31:44] i never got nothing in there from him i
[31:47] wanted
[31:52] bills
[31:54] i don't even think he's a deliverer of
[31:56] good news
[32:00] so why should i have a whole commentary
[32:02] about the mailman
[32:07] and that's what i'm saying if we're not
[32:08] careful
[32:10] we let the message become letter
[32:16] and and paul says i didn't minister
[32:18] letter to you but i ministered spirit
[32:22] and and that's
[32:24] what he said and then we'll just read
[32:26] this statement down a little farther
[32:27] which was in paragraph 32
[32:30] he said
[32:31] he says
[32:33] and when an unclean spirit has gone out
[32:36] of the man he walks in dry places
[32:40] returning back then bringing sever
[32:44] seven other devils with him
[32:47] now the reason that happens is because a
[32:49] lot of people
[32:51] leave it there
[32:57] now i know we
[32:59] we're wanting to go forward aren't we
[33:03] i mean we're building a building by
[33:05] god's grace that everybody in here will
[33:08] only fill up the first two rows
[33:12] so we're going to have to have something
[33:13] a lot more genuine
[33:15] to attract the unbelievers because the
[33:19] so-called believers don't even come to
[33:21] church
[33:22] anymore
[33:26] so we're ready to go to the highways and
[33:28] byways aren't we
[33:32] but what are we going to take there
[33:34] we've got to take life
[33:36] and life more abundant we've got to take
[33:38] the power of the resurrection with we've
[33:41] got to talk take something that's that's
[33:44] genuine so in other words you can tell
[33:47] somebody
[33:49] about the message
[33:52] you can get them maybe to come out of
[33:54] their denomination
[33:57] but if they never go on
[34:01] to get the power
[34:04] and life
[34:06] that brother branham was restoring
[34:10] if if they don't get the restoration of
[34:13] the weapon
[34:16] then
[34:17] they'll walk in dry places
[34:24] and they
[34:27] and and that's what they do
[34:29] and then they end off worse off
[34:32] than they were in the first place
[34:35] don't just leave it there
[34:38] and
[34:40] if you do
[34:41] just repent of your sins and go on then
[34:44] you're going to be worse off than ever
[34:49] so there's oh there's something to go on
[34:52] to
[34:53] and we we talked about that that we went
[34:55] on and said that we know that we've got
[34:57] to have
[34:58] the the power so we understand that paul
[35:02] he revealed
[35:04] he
[35:05] ministered
[35:07] not
[35:08] the letter
[35:10] but the spirit
[35:12] because the letter killeth
[35:14] but the spirit giveth life
[35:17] and so what he revealed was the word
[35:21] now it's not letter word
[35:25] what what it is it's revealed word
[35:29] right wasn't it in matthew 16
[35:33] 17
[35:34] i i believe that uh
[35:39] you see if i have that just right here
[35:41] you know the scripture by heart i'm sure
[35:43] but matthew 16
[35:48] 17
[35:49] says this wise
[35:51] and
[35:52] that
[35:54] and they said unto him
[35:56] and he said unto him
[36:00] but whom say ye
[36:02] that i am
[36:05] and
[36:06] and so that's
[36:08] that's what people are doing
[36:10] so everybody's telling you who christ
[36:13] was
[36:15] what he taught
[36:17] what he preached
[36:19] and
[36:20] that's why we have what 900 different
[36:23] denominations
[36:25] but he goes on to say and simon peter
[36:28] answered and said thou art the christ
[36:31] the son of the living god
[36:34] and jesus answered and said unto him
[36:37] blessed art doubt
[36:39] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[36:43] not revealed it unto thee
[36:47] but my father which is in heaven
[36:52] so in other words you didn't get this
[36:54] from man
[36:58] so this is the source
[37:03] the source was the father in heaven
[37:06] so that's the source and why does he
[37:08] have to be the source
[37:10] because he's the only thing that has
[37:13] eternal life
[37:16] so now look at really as we read this
[37:18] scripture in the light of what that
[37:20] we've been talking about today
[37:23] he says unto thee but my father which is
[37:26] in heaven
[37:27] and i say also unto thee
[37:30] thou art peter and upon this rock i will
[37:33] build my church
[37:35] in other words upon the rock of
[37:37] revelation
[37:39] in other words god
[37:41] showing you
[37:43] and quickening to you and revealing to
[37:46] you this is what i'm going to make our
[37:49] church on so paul didn't preach
[37:52] he preached the revealed word or the
[37:55] quicken word
[37:58] and what does quick and mean means
[38:00] brought to life
[38:02] so he preached the word
[38:04] brought to life can i say it a different
[38:07] way or the word brought into
[38:11] our lives
[38:13] that that's what he is preaching in
[38:15] other words not living not leaving the
[38:18] word here
[38:20] as a text
[38:22] or as a letter
[38:24] but that word now dwelling in us
[38:29] amen
[38:31] and i like as we read this he said
[38:35] he said upon this rock
[38:37] i will build my church
[38:41] and the gates
[38:43] of hell
[38:44] shall not prevail against it
[38:48] there he is he went full circle
[38:53] right we're going to be in a battle
[38:54] right so he gave us something
[38:57] that the enemy that fortified us
[39:01] that the enemy couldn't break through
[39:05] but it wasn't letter word
[39:09] it was quickened word
[39:12] it was revealed word that's what it was
[39:16] that he couldn't fight against
[39:20] now he can fight against the letter
[39:22] anybody want to get in a good letter
[39:24] fight
[39:26] we'll just call the church a christ guy
[39:30] they live for a good religious argument
[39:35] they'll talk to you about works and
[39:37] they'll put the scriptures together in a
[39:39] way that you're going what
[39:42] what bible are you reading man they got
[39:44] a
[39:47] prophet of god said don't you get in the
[39:49] argument with the good baptist he'll tie
[39:51] you in not
[39:57] because we're not ministering letter
[39:59] word
[40:01] we're ministering revelation
[40:06] noah couldn't minister letter
[40:09] because the letter said it wasn't going
[40:10] to rain
[40:14] you can't
[40:15] minister the baptism of the holy spirit
[40:18] to the church of christ because they
[40:20] believe the days of miracles is fast
[40:23] they believe that he did the work at
[40:26] calvary and if you accept it you don't
[40:28] have to go no farther
[40:34] so they decided not to take john 17.
[40:37] right out of their bible
[40:41] or john 14 also just take it right out
[40:44] of their bible so we're not talking
[40:46] about a word that's a letter word we're
[40:48] not talking about a teaching we're not
[40:50] just talking about all the wonderful
[40:54] and forgive me for this expression
[40:56] but i want to make my point and i trust
[40:59] the lord will forgive me but it's not
[41:01] all the wonderful one-liners
[41:05] that brother branham had
[41:08] are all the little stories
[41:12] it goes beyond that
[41:14] those were to attract your attention
[41:18] that was him casting the net
[41:20] and pulling us in
[41:22] but he was trying to get us to the point
[41:25] where we understood that we could take
[41:28] the same word he took right that's what
[41:31] he said this morning and defeat satan on
[41:34] the same grounds any place anytime
[41:37] anywhere that that's what he wants he
[41:39] wants us not to have the letter of it
[41:42] but he wants us to have the power of it
[41:47] the word of it
[41:50] and the only way you're going to get
[41:51] that word is by revelation
[41:56] it's the quicken word
[41:59] the word made alive to us
[42:03] and that's what people have done
[42:06] they took brother branham as the letter
[42:09] as a fulfillment of malachi 4 5 the
[42:12] fulfillment of luke
[42:14] 17 30.
[42:16] they they took all those things
[42:19] and then when they were challenged
[42:23] they fell apart
[42:26] they had no answer
[42:30] they had no answer because they never
[42:32] had the revelation there is no answer
[42:37] for unbelief
[42:41] there's no answer for unbelief
[42:46] there's no answer for someone that
[42:48] doesn't have revelation
[42:50] because all they're left with is
[42:52] reasoning
[42:55] and that's what they're stuck with
[42:56] you've got to pity them
[42:59] so it's there it's their revealed
[43:02] word
[43:04] that the gates of hell
[43:06] cannot
[43:08] prevail against
[43:10] it's not the letter
[43:12] because the letter killeth
[43:14] he can prevail against the letter
[43:18] and that's what they did they went out
[43:20] they just didn't they just didn't go out
[43:23] from amongst us
[43:26] but they turned back around and tried to
[43:28] kill us
[43:32] thinking that they were doing god a
[43:34] service
[43:36] you take people like rod bergen and
[43:38] lance larue and tim humes and and and
[43:42] uh
[43:45] jeff
[43:47] what's ever his name
[43:49] from ohio
[43:51] they're fulfilling that scripture
[43:56] they're trying to kill you
[44:01] thinking they're doing god a service
[44:05] they're sincere
[44:08] oh you need to be delivered
[44:12] you need to be saved
[44:14] you need to come out from amongst this
[44:16] cult
[44:19] you can't explain the cloud you can't
[44:22] explain how he could be here and there i
[44:24] wonder when philip got over to that
[44:27] revival and just said hey i just
[44:29] baptized the guy over down here
[44:33] on the way to the desert down here man
[44:35] we had a revival right there i opened
[44:37] the word of god to him and he took the
[44:39] word of god we went down to the water
[44:41] and baptized him and they're saying well
[44:43] wait a minute
[44:48] that's 300
[44:50] miles away
[44:52] how could you how could you be in
[44:53] houston and be on the mountain and how
[44:56] could you be a how could you how could
[44:57] you do how do you feel phil if you're
[44:59] blowing my mind here
[45:01] i can't i can't get a hold of this thing
[45:04] what are you talking about i'm talking
[45:06] about transforming power
[45:11] to do the unspeakable
[45:17] amen
[45:19] the unchanging god working in unexpected
[45:22] ways
[45:24] that's right
[45:26] see all zakat was malachi 4-5 they never
[45:28] understood the message
[45:32] they saw he was a prophet
[45:34] by his works
[45:37] but they never read the letter
[45:40] that empowered you
[45:42] that's all they do now they're just
[45:43] trying to kill our influence everywhere
[45:46] all bold you know going having
[45:48] anti-brother branham conventions
[45:52] you still see they have no life without
[45:54] the message
[45:59] they're still preaching the message
[46:01] but from the dead side
[46:03] they still don't have a gospel
[46:07] without the message
[46:09] so they still don't have life
[46:11] now they're just preaching brother not a
[46:13] prophet brother brahm didn't do this you
[46:14] can't explain this brother brown is here
[46:16] i don't believe this i don't believe
[46:17] that yeah
[46:19] how would you like to been born again in
[46:21] phillips
[46:23] revival
[46:25] how many miles did he say 200 or
[46:27] something he was
[46:30] went right on preaching
[46:33] wherever he landed
[46:36] he just went on preaching
[46:38] now when you can talk to that
[46:41] ethiopian
[46:44] and explain how he was baptized the same
[46:48] day
[46:49] without jets he didn't have captain
[46:52] james to fly him in us
[46:54] cessna citation over there
[46:59] he had the same power
[47:04] you tell me how jesus could go to hell
[47:08] and preach the souls that were lost
[47:14] how many believes that this message has
[47:16] been preached to a lot of lost souls
[47:19] i don't care
[47:21] do you understand because that we're not
[47:23] the ministers of the letter
[47:26] we're not trying to prove the letter
[47:29] we're not trying to prove the history
[47:32] what we're trying to prove is that he's
[47:35] the same yesterday today
[47:38] and forever
[47:40] [Music]
[47:41] and so we find out that the only thing
[47:44] that the gates of hell
[47:46] can't prevail against is the word that's
[47:51] quickened to you
[47:54] right faith is the evidence or
[47:56] revelation is the evidence of things
[47:59] hoped for not yet seen
[48:03] that that's what that's what it is so if
[48:06] you've got revelation and the word's
[48:08] been quickened to you
[48:10] then you have what defeat if you just go
[48:13] to him with the scriptures
[48:16] and with the letter
[48:18] and i remember earl williams sharing
[48:20] with me one time
[48:22] before he went to be with the lord that
[48:25] he said you know i i i went to pick
[48:27] brother branham up to take him to coffee
[48:30] with these ministers
[48:32] and uh so he came out and he jumped in
[48:35] my car
[48:37] and we were headed to such and such
[48:39] place sambo's or someplace to have
[48:41] coffee with these ministers and he said
[48:44] i looked at him and said brother branham
[48:46] aren't you taking your bible
[48:51] and
[48:53] you know and i i and what was beautiful
[48:56] of that story to me was you you saw
[49:00] earl's mindset
[49:03] you better bring the letter
[49:07] and brother bram said ah earl
[49:09] he says their bible reads the same as
[49:11] mine does
[49:14] i thought oh my
[49:17] there it is
[49:18] he had the spirit of the word he didn't
[49:21] need the letter
[49:23] he he wasn't going to argue scriptures
[49:25] with them
[49:27] he wasn't going to argue letter with
[49:29] them
[49:31] he was going in truth
[49:34] and so that's the thing that doesn't
[49:35] prevail so don't become under the
[49:38] misguidance of the idea that you're just
[49:41] going to take
[49:42] your idea
[49:46] of anything
[49:48] and make it work
[49:51] you've got to have
[49:52] it quickened
[49:54] made alive to you
[49:57] and the only thing that does it's the
[49:59] spirit of god
[50:00] and you've got to be trained
[50:03] in waiting for the spirit of god to make
[50:06] it alive to you
[50:08] you don't have to take
[50:10] thought
[50:12] let's read in john 14 as we begin to
[50:15] close
[50:17] this evening
[50:20] now we know
[50:21] as we're going to read saint john the
[50:23] 14th chapter starting with the 16th
[50:26] verse
[50:27] now we know that god never speaks a word
[50:31] without it having a purpose
[50:33] how many knows that
[50:35] he never speaks a word without having
[50:38] its purpose
[50:39] and that purpose
[50:41] has to be revealed or made known to you
[50:45] personally
[50:48] for your life
[50:52] in other
[50:56] he spoke it
[50:59] now if you take the letter of it i watch
[51:02] people use scriptures they take one
[51:04] scripture and they base all of their
[51:06] baptism on one scripture well there's
[51:10] water blood and spirit
[51:14] and these three agree in one
[51:17] and the other ones and they take that
[51:18] one scripture
[51:21] and they try to base
[51:23] everything on it
[51:25] they'll take one scripture and you must
[51:28] confess that jesus that you're a sinner
[51:30] and jesus christ is lord and savior and
[51:33] they build a whole system
[51:36] on that one thing
[51:39] but it's letter
[51:44] and we don't want to take this message
[51:46] and make it letter
[51:49] and i'm afraid
[51:52] that's what
[51:53] has happened to us a lot
[51:56] is we're teaching what brother random
[51:58] said and we're teaching
[52:01] the doctrines of things the doctrines of
[52:04] water baptism the doctrine doctrines of
[52:06] this which paul says let us move on
[52:09] perfection because those things we shall
[52:11] do if god prevents
[52:15] but there's something else that he's got
[52:18] for us
[52:19] something that he's trying to put into
[52:21] the church that will quicken them out of
[52:24] this world
[52:26] the rapture is not a date
[52:29] it's a condition
[52:34] so let's read here in john
[52:38] 14.
[52:44] let's start with the 11th verse
[52:50] believe me
[52:53] that i am in the father
[52:56] and the father
[52:57] in me
[53:02] or else believe me
[53:05] for the very work's sake
[53:10] now look at the revelation there
[53:14] would you rather believe him because
[53:15] what he did
[53:17] or he believed him because of who he was
[53:20] i heard this song the other day the
[53:22] greater vision
[53:24] said it wasn't because he
[53:28] calmed the waves or the wind listened to
[53:31] him it wasn't what he did
[53:34] but it was who he was
[53:39] but because of who he was
[53:42] he did
[53:43] what he did
[53:45] can you
[53:47] if you if we keep trying to approach it
[53:49] through the letter we'll never come to
[53:51] the realization of who that we are
[53:55] because we don't do things by the letter
[53:58] we do it because who we are
[54:03] and that's what's quickened to you
[54:05] and we read it this morning he gives
[54:08] every believer the authority to cast out
[54:11] devils
[54:12] not be by the letter but by the
[54:15] authority that was given to him by the
[54:18] quickening power so let's just read
[54:20] these as we begin to close this evening
[54:22] believe me that i am in the father and
[54:25] the father in me or else believe me for
[54:27] the very work's sake verily verily i say
[54:30] unto you he that believeth on me
[54:34] the works that i do shall he do also
[54:38] and greater works than these shall he do
[54:41] because i go unto my father
[54:45] and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name
[54:49] that will i do
[54:51] that the father may be glorified in the
[54:54] son
[54:56] if he loved me
[54:58] keep my commandments
[55:01] look he said i skipped the verse and if
[55:03] you shall ask anything in my name i will
[55:06] do it for if you love me keep my
[55:08] commandments
[55:10] and i will pray the father
[55:13] and he shall give you another comforter
[55:17] that he
[55:19] may abide
[55:20] with you forever
[55:22] even the spirit of truth
[55:26] whom the world cannot receive
[55:29] because it seeth him not
[55:32] neither knoweth him but ye
[55:36] know him for he dwelleth with you
[55:39] and shall
[55:41] be
[55:42] in you
[55:43] oh i would have loved to bend in that
[55:46] upper room
[55:52] how many people miss it
[55:54] that are trinitarians
[55:56] and think a third person
[55:59] came down out of heaven
[56:02] when it was the very person he said
[56:06] i i i will not leave you comfortless
[56:09] but i will come again
[56:11] another scripture
[56:13] and i'll be with you even in you
[56:17] till the end
[56:18] how do you think it was when that upper
[56:20] room
[56:21] when they're praying and all of a sudden
[56:23] the pillars of fire start to show up and
[56:25] the wind starts to blow
[56:27] i think you ought to make it a great be
[56:29] as dramatically as you can
[56:31] you know what i mean because that was
[56:33] the biggest in your face devil
[56:35] that that happened
[56:38] because he thought he put him away right
[56:41] he thought he done burying them he
[56:44] thought he was off the scene and now
[56:46] here he comes back and he breaks himself
[56:49] up and now he's got 120 of them that's
[56:53] going to spread the world like a plague
[56:57] we're satan's plague
[57:02] you've heard of clover 19 when we're
[57:04] john 3 16.
[57:08] as many who believeth on him gave you
[57:10] power to be the sons and daughters of
[57:12] god here we are satan
[57:15] here he is
[57:17] in me
[57:18] back again doing the same works that he
[57:21] did when he was here on the earth here
[57:23] he is he's right here inside of me
[57:29] you think they got a different anointing
[57:32] no
[57:33] he said can you be baptized with the
[57:36] baptism where i am baptized with
[57:41] and they're just looking at a man
[57:43] because he was a man
[57:45] and they said i believe we can
[57:48] and he says i believe it too
[57:51] because that's what i come for i'm going
[57:54] to go to calvary
[57:56] i'm going to pay the price for sin
[57:58] they're going to put me in the grave
[58:00] because that's the last thing that i've
[58:02] got to overcome on your behalf is the
[58:05] grave
[58:08] because you've all been condemned to
[58:10] death
[58:11] so i to the grave
[58:14] so i'll pay the price for your sins
[58:16] could you imagine if that's all the
[58:18] further he went
[58:20] he said then i'm going to go into the
[58:21] grave
[58:23] and i'm going to come out of the grave
[58:25] that i can leave all the captive free
[58:30] i can overcome death
[58:32] hell
[58:33] and the grave
[58:35] and now i can bring the same quickening
[58:38] power
[58:39] back to the church
[58:41] that will raise them up too
[58:47] that's
[58:49] the beauty of it
[58:53] what does it do to preach jesus died on
[58:55] the cross
[58:57] and he forgave your sins
[59:00] and that he went in the grave and rose
[59:02] up again
[59:05] if he couldn't impart to you
[59:08] the same life
[59:10] to take you out of the grave
[59:12] paul never preached the letter
[59:16] he preached if the same spirit
[59:19] that dwelt in jesus christ dwelling you
[59:22] it'll do for him
[59:25] for you what it did for him
[59:29] that's the gospel
[59:31] that's what we preach we preach
[59:33] resurrection and life
[59:36] not only the forgiveness of sins
[59:39] but we preach the indwelling power of
[59:42] the spirit of god
[59:45] we preach the baptism of the holy spirit
[59:48] we don't preach that it's manifested in
[59:50] emotion
[59:52] we believe it's preaching the
[59:53] manifestation of the power over sin and
[59:57] the devil
[1:00:03] get behind me satan
[1:00:09] so we read
[1:00:12] i will pray the father and he shall give
[1:00:14] you another comforter and he that he may
[1:00:17] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:00:19] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:00:22] because it seeth them not
[1:00:25] because they got to see it you know why
[1:00:28] they got to see it because
[1:00:31] there's something
[1:00:32] that
[1:00:33] gives you sight
[1:00:36] beyond eyesight
[1:00:38] and that's revelation
[1:00:40] they can't believe it because god hasn't
[1:00:43] revealed it to them
[1:00:46] we don't walk by sight
[1:00:49] we walk by revelation
[1:00:52] he said
[1:00:53] neither know with him but ye ye know him
[1:00:57] for he dwelleth with you
[1:00:59] and shall be in you i will not leave you
[1:01:02] comfortless i will come to you oh my
[1:01:08] just think in that upper room when he
[1:01:10] showed up in spirit form
[1:01:14] and they knew he was there
[1:01:18] they could sense his presence
[1:01:21] and his being
[1:01:23] being there
[1:01:26] they knew it was him
[1:01:30] just like you could feel the presence of
[1:01:32] god sometimes
[1:01:34] in the anointing they knew it was him
[1:01:38] and they all sat there and all of a
[1:01:40] sudden he started coming in each one of
[1:01:43] them
[1:01:46] and all of a sudden they knew he was in
[1:01:48] them
[1:01:52] they knew they had him with him
[1:01:56] they knew he kept his word
[1:02:00] that's the baptism
[1:02:03] is the person
[1:02:04] of jesus christ
[1:02:07] being made known to you
[1:02:10] personally
[1:02:12] i know he lives in me
[1:02:14] not an anointing not some other thing
[1:02:17] not a third person
[1:02:21] but him
[1:02:23] and you looked at yourself he said oh
[1:02:25] i'm so filthy i'm so dirty that's not
[1:02:27] your choice
[1:02:30] it's not your choice to make yourself
[1:02:32] unworthy it's your choice to accept the
[1:02:36] pardon
[1:02:41] because he cleansed you from all
[1:02:42] unrighteousness
[1:02:44] and let him come in so we read he said i
[1:02:47] will not leave but i will come to you a
[1:02:50] little while
[1:02:52] and the
[1:02:54] a little while and the world seeth me no
[1:02:57] more
[1:02:58] but ye
[1:02:59] see me
[1:03:00] because i live
[1:03:02] ye shall live also
[1:03:04] and then we could read on but let's just
[1:03:06] step down to the
[1:03:08] 26th verse
[1:03:10] but the comforter
[1:03:12] which is the holy ghost
[1:03:15] whom the father will send in my name
[1:03:20] he shall teach you all things
[1:03:22] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:03:26] whatsoever i have said
[1:03:29] unto you
[1:03:32] so
[1:03:33] that we understand now that
[1:03:35] it's not an idea of studying everything
[1:03:39] that uh
[1:03:42] everything that the scriptures uh
[1:03:45] say and get the word and all that
[1:03:47] because we already know what the
[1:03:49] comfort's gonna do is he's gonna bring
[1:03:51] to our remembrance
[1:03:54] the things that he taught in others he's
[1:03:56] gonna bring to us and quicken to us and
[1:03:59] make us known to us and make the word
[1:04:03] living to us
[1:04:06] because you can't store it up in your
[1:04:08] mind
[1:04:11] i remember the prophet of god at 55
[1:04:13] years ago saying i used to have all
[1:04:15] these scriptures memorized
[1:04:18] but now i got to write them down
[1:04:21] man i'd hate to rely on my memory
[1:04:26] but there's only one thing you can trust
[1:04:28] that he's given me
[1:04:31] something
[1:04:33] that will quicken these things to me
[1:04:36] and bring him to my remembrance
[1:04:39] and if i have that
[1:04:41] i have it all
[1:04:43] if i have one cup of the ocean i have
[1:04:46] all
[1:04:47] the ocean
[1:04:49] and let's
[1:04:50] close
[1:04:52] with this
[1:04:53] thought
[1:04:55] so we're talking about that
[1:05:00] he says god knew this
[1:05:02] so he sent to the church
[1:05:05] that so satan would not outsmart them
[1:05:08] a place to be fortified
[1:05:11] he sent them the holy ghost
[1:05:13] and the church does not claim to be
[1:05:16] smart they just came to
[1:05:19] believe
[1:05:21] so he gave him something
[1:05:24] which was the holy spirit
[1:05:26] the spirit of life
[1:05:28] now i want to read this last thing
[1:05:31] out of
[1:05:34] let me see if i have it here yes i think
[1:05:37] i have it
[1:05:42] well this is the world falling apart
[1:05:50] okay
[1:05:51] i'd like to read this in this is from
[1:05:53] the conflict
[1:05:54] between god and satan
[1:05:56] and he's he says he's talking to this
[1:06:02] he says so we have two classes today
[1:06:05] that's
[1:06:07] professing
[1:06:08] now listen close
[1:06:10] in closing
[1:06:11] we have two classes that's professing to
[1:06:15] be the bride of christ
[1:06:17] paragraph 207 the conflict between god
[1:06:20] and satan
[1:06:23] two classes of people that claim to be
[1:06:25] the bride of christ that's right
[1:06:28] and the bible speaks that there will be
[1:06:31] two classes that's right the wise
[1:06:34] version
[1:06:35] and the foolish ones
[1:06:41] is that right
[1:06:43] two classes
[1:06:45] the church says we are the church
[1:06:49] and they go out
[1:06:51] and have these great evangelistic
[1:06:53] campaigns
[1:06:55] bring the people into church
[1:06:59] the woman continue on
[1:07:01] with their way of doing the men continue
[1:07:05] on with their way of doing
[1:07:08] they never changed their doctrine
[1:07:12] they got it all wrote out
[1:07:15] and documented
[1:07:17] and set down
[1:07:19] and those accos apostle creeds and
[1:07:22] certain prayers and all these catechisms
[1:07:25] and everything
[1:07:27] that
[1:07:28] in everything
[1:07:30] that
[1:07:31] the methodist and baptist
[1:07:34] and presbyterians and catholics and all
[1:07:36] that read
[1:07:39] they got all their doctrine laid down
[1:07:43] they've got it all laid out
[1:07:45] there's no room for what
[1:07:48] revelation
[1:07:50] there's no room for it to be changed
[1:07:53] or quickened
[1:07:55] it's already spelled out it's already
[1:07:58] what we believe this is what this
[1:07:59] scripture means this is what this
[1:08:01] scripture means and paul said i didn't
[1:08:04] minister the letter
[1:08:08] i didn't minister a doctrine
[1:08:11] and things that were
[1:08:13] were
[1:08:15] etched in tablets of stone
[1:08:21] i didn't put it on parchment
[1:08:25] i put it in your heart
[1:08:33] if and
[1:08:35] if he and and so now he's saying this is
[1:08:37] what the conflict is
[1:08:39] he said it's all wrote out
[1:08:43] what they all read and they accept that
[1:08:46] catechism be some because some great man
[1:08:51] back behind
[1:08:52] said that it was right
[1:08:54] he might have been a great man he might
[1:08:57] have been right but it hasn't got the
[1:09:00] authority to say that
[1:09:02] because the bible is god's authority it
[1:09:06] is
[1:09:06] the written word of god and any man that
[1:09:10] adds one thing to it or takes anything
[1:09:12] from it the same shall be taken his part
[1:09:16] out of the book of life
[1:09:18] and that
[1:09:19] can't be done so now
[1:09:22] and we have two possessions and he goes
[1:09:24] on to read see they've got it all wrote
[1:09:27] out
[1:09:30] and
[1:09:31] can you imagine us thinking we got it
[1:09:33] all figured out
[1:09:35] we got it all laid out we know what we
[1:09:37] believe we know the seals have been open
[1:09:39] we know the lamb's book of life we know
[1:09:41] this we know that we all that we've got
[1:09:43] it all figured out we got it all laid
[1:09:45] out our doctrine doesn't change
[1:09:49] and it's we get to the place that god
[1:09:51] can't talk to us
[1:09:52] he can't reveal to us we can't be led of
[1:09:55] the spirit
[1:09:58] he's not going to lead us outside his
[1:09:59] word
[1:10:00] but he's going to lead us to manifest
[1:10:03] his word
[1:10:06] that we might glorify the father in
[1:10:08] heaven
[1:10:09] that we might be written epistles
[1:10:12] that we might show the same god
[1:10:15] that appeared in this generation
[1:10:18] in the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17
[1:10:22] 30.
[1:10:24] revelations 10 7
[1:10:26] that the same spirit
[1:10:29] that was manifested in the son of man
[1:10:31] ministry for our day
[1:10:33] that that same spirit
[1:10:36] has come back to earth again
[1:10:41] that same spirit
[1:10:44] that was in jesus christ
[1:10:47] showing the signs to the jews
[1:10:50] came back again
[1:10:52] to show those same signs to the gentiles
[1:10:58] so god could be a just god
[1:11:02] and he imparts that same spirit
[1:11:06] into his elect lady
[1:11:10] that will lead them and guide them in
[1:11:12] all truth and righteousness so they
[1:11:15] don't turn this into a letter
[1:11:21] it's not something we believe
[1:11:23] it's something that's alive and leading
[1:11:26] us
[1:11:27] step by step
[1:11:29] every day
[1:11:31] of
[1:11:32] the world every day in this world that
[1:11:35] we live in
[1:11:36] god's word
[1:11:38] is being quickened to us
[1:11:41] so it's not
[1:11:43] what we read
