shame forever I will bless your holy name I adore you I adore you Lamb of God my savior Prince of PE I adore you I adore you Jesus you mean all the world to me I Adore You Lord let's bow our heads this morning commit the service to him Heavenly Father Lord that what better words could we say father we adore you you mean all the world to us Lord there's a million places that we could be this morning a million paths that we could be on but Lord your hand has Lo brought us here Lord and we find ourselves an opportunity to once again hear from you Lord I pray that you would now have your way in this service as we committed to you Lord we thank you for all that you've done for us we thank you for your guiding hand we thank you for your hand of supp supply and provision we thank you for your hand of healing and strengthening Lord we thank you that you ever reached down and set us on this way Lord we pray that you would have your will this morning Lord we pray that your spirit would just deal with each Heart Lord I pray that every need would be met and Lord that your word would have the preeminence as we commit it to you in Jesus name amen let me go ahead and have your seats you know there's a um wonderful testimony given in the scriptures about two men who as a result of their work and their witness caused 5,000 people to believe the word to be led to the Lord and because that didn't agree with how religious things were done in that day the church leaders took a hold of them and held them for questioning and demanded that they give an account of themselves by what right do you do this work under whose authority are you doing these things in the church and as these men be began to give their witness and to give account of themselves it says in Acts 4:13 now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them it became apparent that they had been with Jesus you know it wasn't because of how much they studied or how well they knew the scriptures or all the things that have been taught but it was because of who they had been with it was the result of his presence not their knowledge that caused them to do this work you know it says they were unlearned an ignorant man in fact history will tell us that they couldn't read they couldn't even write their own name in fact one of the oldest church fathers tells us that until he was a very old man John had never even seen his own face until one day he saw a mirror and saw his face in it but there was an effect of them having been with Jesus one of these unlearned and ignorant men would go on to say in the Book of Revelation chapter 1 unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen You Know Not only was this an unlearned and ignorant man declaring something which was not popular in religion or in the church but he was giving a testimony that he was a king and that he was a priest unto God you know this was on my mind this week as I was reading psalm 21 if you want to turn to that this morning we'll be reading that it's the psalm of a king you know and he begins in verse one the king shall joy in thy strength O Lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice and as we'll read through the psalm it'll be David speaking of all the things all the work which God had done for him it's the psalm of a king but you know as I read this you know and this king is giving account to all the ways that God had been gracious to him it you know it occurred to me was it was it because he was a king that God was doing these things or was he a king because God had done all these things for him oh the other unlearned and ignorant man said this but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood Unholy Nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God that's right which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy that's right as John said in Revelation he has made us yes Kings and Priests we weren't Kings and Priests to begin with he made us because of the work that he did you know you can see why the church why the religious leaders would struggle with that I mean you're nobody I mean you're nothing you can't even read and you're saying you're a king and priest you know by what right do you make this claim you know that he has made us Kings and Priests a royal priesthood you know Exodus says it this way Exodus 19 now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel that's right a kingdom of priests you know what is a king you know surely we all have these Earthly visions of what a king looks like you know a man sitting on a chair with a crown or a scepter in a palace with people bowing at his presence but what is a king really as we look at Psalm 21 begins to describe describe what a king is thou Hast given him his heart's desire this is verse one verse two rather and has not withholden the request of his lips you know the thing with a king is all he has to do is just ask and it's given to him if he needs something someone goes and gets it if he wants something it's his he has but to speak it what did Jesus tell us time and time again an example is John 1623 and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you amen mark 11:24 therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them sounds like a king to me when a King asks for something it's his you know he's put us in a place whereas 1 John 3:22 says whatsoever we ask we receive of him just like a king verse three of Psalm 21 for thou preventest him with the blessings of of goodness thou set us a crown of pure gold on his head a king has a crown and all the blessings of the kingdom are his Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ that sounds like a king to me Psalm 21:4 he the king asked Life Of Thee and thou gavest it him even Length of days forever and ever John 5:24 verily verily I say unto you here that he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into Life John 10:28 and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand a king you know no doubt many scriptures come to mind as we go through that and we could go through each one of these verses in Psalm 21 and the thing is is this isn't someone a king talking about all the good things he has because he's a king he's a king because God has done all these things for him you know we're going to read Psalm 21 together if you want to go ahead and stand but you know he has made us Kings and Priests on this Earth the real question is is what do you need to be about his work that's what a king is a king is someone who has dominion and a priest is someone who's about a Ministry and if he is already made us a royal priesthood a kingdom of priests the question is is what do you need to be about his work just ask it's yours to be about his word let's go ahead and read that Psalm 21 together the psalm of a king the king shall joy in thy strength oh Lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he Rejoice thou Hast given him his heart's desire and has not withholden the request of his lips ca for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou set us a crown of pure gold on his head he asked Life Of Thee and thou gavest it him even Length of days forever and ever his glory is great in thy salvation honor and Majesty hast thou laid upon him for thou has made him Most Blessed forever thou Hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance for the king trusteth in the Lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men for they intended evil against thee they imagined a misch device which they are not able to perform therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt Make Ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them be thou exalted Lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power amen man God bless you may have your seats amen oh oh I've been to the water and I've been oh and I've been

a god like that a God that can part the Red Sea when I'm hungry that Mana would fall from Heaven and feed my hungry soul and he's the same yesterday today and forever why don't we just approach that

and we're asking that you would just come now in a supernatural way Lord that you would move our thoughts aside Lord we're going through struggles and trials and Temptations on every hand there's darkness and Chaos all around the world and each one of us are just trying to make our way and we want to believe you Lord with everything that is within us we want to believe you and we're thankful that you have sent a word to produce a faith in us that we can believe you and take you at your word that it is not a man but it's the god in the man it's not something that we have done it's something that you have done Lord and so now we're looking to you the author we're so thankful you're the author you are the finisher of our faith not something that we could do but it's something that you have already done we love you now we surrender ourselves to you and ask that you would just have your perfect will and weigh in this service Lord as we're before you now they come on my heart just to pray for our precious brother Ron Spencer knowing more test have come back and they're saying there's advancement into both of his eyes of cancer Lord that's what the doctors say they're doing the best they can but you have been fighting that battle you are the one who said that you would be an enemy to our enemies you'd be an adversary to our adversaries so Lord I'm asking that you would just move mightily on the scene once again for our precious brother Lord give him strength at this very moment encourage him Lord increase his faith for we know that with you all things are possible and the enemy has already been defeated Lord so we just thank you now for the victory we give you all the praise and glory in Jesus precious name we ask it amen blesses wonderful name if you have your Bibles and you'll turn in the Book of Joshua and then maybe you could uh find the book of Ephesians and we'll also uh read from there it's always good to come together with the saints of God and be able to sing the songs of Zion and be able to praise him and give him glory and we're so thankful that we're a people that we're not just wor shiing in spirit and and uh uh just you know being able to fill his blessings and his presence and and say all that was wonderful but we're worshiping in spirit and in truth something that we're a part of Amen let's just read in our Bibles in uh Joshua chapter one Joshua chapter 1 and verse one now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people under the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel I can't imagine how Joshua felt upon hearing that he could have said you know how long I've been waiting for this and now the Lord is telling arise it's time it's time to go over it's time to possess the land and he says every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I had said unto Moses amen you may be seated we pray that God would add a blessing upon the reading of his word every place the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses I I try to I have a lot of things uh just over overwhelming in my heart U that I would like to to speak to you um and just maybe uh before we get into our message um just brother Brandon would say things that you know he he he'll just say these onliners or phrases you know that really catch your attention and because it's the word of God it it just it can always be an unfolding uh uh thought because it it he Christ is the word and so uh uh the prophet would say something like uh uh the Book of Joshua it's a a perfect parallel of Ephesians and and uh or Ephesian is a perfect parallel of Joshua and and I was just uh thinking about those things about parallels and and looking into the word and just along uh thinking about that my heart just started to settle on a message called a paradox and I started to listen to a paradox and I started with the one he he preaches in 1960 and then he preaches it in ' 61 and 62 and and uh 63 64 65 I believe he preaches it six times and and and I was just I was just meditating upon this and I started to to just think about parallels and paradoxes and and how how the prophet is saying that you know Ephesians parallels Joshua and many times we look into the word or we hear the prophet say something and and sometimes we just really can't make sense of it well I don't know about you but there's a lot of things that are laying in the word that I read it and and maybe I I I I try to to understand it I I try to uh uh maybe uh make it uh fit where in my mind where maybe I I can I can see what the prophet's saying and and many times you just can't do it you you you try to tie this the prophet will tie something together and and thank God it takes a prophet to be the one to tie it together because when men try to tie things together they tie things in knots and messes and just make a mess everything but I'm thankful that when God speaks through a prophet if he ties something together my responsibility say amen amen if the prophet tied it together it's tied together I'm not going to try to undo it I don't want to tie anything else into it and sometimes it's just a paradox and faith is a paradox so sometimes when we look into the word a and we see something laying there we just say man okay that's a that's a perfect parallel and it's a paradox a lot of times when you have a a a parallel well it's parallel because you can see that it's parallel I can see that those two boards are parallel it's something you can see but many times it's not something that you can see with the natural Li it has to be by faith and if Ephesians is a perfect parallel of Joshua there has to be a faith in The Believer to be able to look in the word and say if that's a perfect parallel Lord by faith I see myself in the word going to be a paradox there's things laying in the word they their perfect par parallels and things concerning you it's a complete Paradox and you can't you can't reason it you can't make sense of it and when brother Brandon would preach a paradox he would say that Webster when he would preach uh Webster's definition of a paradox is something that's incredible but it's true it's a paradox it's something that's incredible it seems unbelievable but yet W with with with all of how incredible it is and all how unbelievable it might appear it is true so when we look into the word I want us to by faith uh what I want to preach to you uh this morning is footsteps of Faith footsteps of Faith because oh God has given a promise now and if Ephesians is a perfect parallel of Joshua right then by Faith by footsteps you are taking the land that's right I love that because if you go into a trial come on you might have felt like you got whooped you might feel like you got stomped on and you just got all beat up but I maybe you're getting back up and you got a black eye and you felt like you got just whooped you just looked at and say my feet were there my feet were there and you might have pulled one on over me this time but my feet were there and God said wherever my feet go I am going to possess the trial I am going to be victorious I don't care what you're facing this morning come on I don't care how hard the trial seems if you're there your feet are there and if your feet are there God is there because he gave you a Divine promise that where your feet go you shall possess the land I say something I to well up in you right now that trial that hardship and everything that you're going through you're standing there yes it might be a paradox so we want to just try to lay a little Foundation before we move too far a prophet would say in adoption as I was just feeding on on these uh these messages that the the the prophet preached on a paradox um he he would mention um he would mention Joshua and he actually takes his text out of Joshua 10 for for many of them and then in the last Paradox he preaches he pulls in uh Joshua chapter one and and many times when when brother brandom would start to preach a paradox I know in the first one that he preaches uh uh before he even gets to his text and I tell you don't don't ever despise what the prophet says before his text no don't ever think just cut it off he said now let's pray you're missing a wealth you're missing a vast wealth of of God and His holy spirit continuing to do what he can only do and that's discern the thoughts and intense of your heart feed your hungry soul and and brother brandom in and I believe the first Paradox he he preaches he starts to talk about a a vision that he had he said I had a vision that that just drove it just uh drove me to my knees and it drove me out in this into the Wilderness and he starts to talk about how how how this drove him out into the Wilderness and and one of the brothers said well he was he was going out there just to seek God for an answer he's like well brother don't you go out there for uh uh to get visions and things like that he goes no I I don't go out there for for that you can't pull anything out of God he said that that's something that God brings on to you you know and he starts to tell them I went out there because I I wanted to uh uh uh I I just I I I wanted to to understand this vision and and what what God was was uh uh wanting to say and he starts to tell about this Vision about how uh it was the vision of the Mamba how he went out there and this this snake there that was coming for his brother it was certain death and he said it's a type of sin and it's the greatest of all of them it's it's death it's that Mamba it's that death snake and he said it was going towards his brother and and and there in that Vision it was just it it that snake turned towards him and he said I've given you power to bind it and and and he bound it in Jesus name and he said now to show you I give you power to unbind it just like the scripture says whenever you shall bind in Earth shall be bound in heaven he said okay if that be true then I say I unbind you in the name of Jesus and and the life came back in it it Rose back up and he and and God would tell him he would say now now in order for you to do this you must be more sincere and then he makes this H seems like a strange transition he goes he just it seems like he just out of nowhere uh mentions something that that seemed uh uh uh how how was this related he goes he goes and and he said you you must be more sinere for this he goes then I seen what he meant them years ago when the hand came out of heaven and read the first nine verses of Joshua and he's referring to there was a time in his ministry that he could take any Bible any Bible you would hand to him he could take a Bible and he say Lord what is your message message to me and it would just fall open to Joshua 1 profound that's a paradox and it just something in my heart struck me as as he he made this relation because we are living in our Ephesians we're we're here possessing the land and it seemed like when he said in order for you to do this you must be so be more sincere and he's preaching this Paradox and he's taken a a text out of Joshua 10 where Joshua would stand there and he would speak to the son because he had a need of and it would stand still well look if if Ephesians perfectly parallels Joshua then we can find our position in the word that God is calling us to this same thing but there must be more sincerity Church sir if God was telling the prophet you must be more sincere where does that place us so now just trying to move into our message and make a little progress by his grace uh brother Brandon would say in adoption he'd say our our Ephesians our Joshua which is the holy spirit Joshua mean Jesus Savior Joshua meaning the Holy Spirit represented it in a spiritual as that was in the natural he is our great warrior he's our great leader as Jo as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about he would say more in the adoption series he would say uh the book of Ephesians perfectly parallels the Old Testament Joshua you say the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua of the New Testament in adoption 3 he would say and now the purpose of these lessons is to Anchor those that have already come across the land the purpose of this study in this book of Ephesians is to positionally place the church where it absolutely stands in Christ it is a type of the Old Testament and the Book of Joshua where Joshua laed and last Sunday we had it where Joshua lauded the land to each man and done it by inspiration why don't we just go ahead and turn in our Bibles to Ephesians because if it's a perfect parallel then it's this is pertaining to you this is your Ephesians this is your Promised Land scriptures were extremely familiar with but we now by faith we must come into the manifestation of the things that we're hearing and this this message our Joshua this ministry of Malachi 4:5 is the one God sent to provide the way to take us into these promises uh make no mistake about it without Malachi four or five none of this is possible now now uh I don't want to fight over that doctrinally I'll just say it maybe like this if you could let me off for me there was no other way for me to come into my inheritance but by the Elijah Ministry but by the Joshua Ministry that was commissioned to take the bride into all the promises that God had left for in the end time outside of that there's no provided way because God said as I was with Moses so shall I be with you Joshua was commissioned to take the people over and Joshua is a type of the great savior a great Jehovah the one who's fighting our battles the one who's given us the victory so then as we look into our Bible uh I pray that it's okay just to do a little reading as we look into Ephesians now footsteps of Faith just have that uh on your heart and parallels and in the word and and Par how Ephesians is paralleling uh uh Joshua and them coming in and taking the land you know there was there were still battles and still hardships and and fighting and everything in the promised land so just because you're fighting and having a hard time and going through a battle don't put yourself out he put you in don't put put yourself out he put you in all right so just starting with verse three he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ that should be enough for you to jump up holler Scream and Shout run around and dance if you could only catch the inspiration oh if we could catch the inspiration and the revelation of what Christ has done for you in this hour that you are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that is your position in Christ now listen to what he's done who did he do it for you know you you you you you ever seen somebody play a a bingo game I think I went one time in my life to a bingo game and you know everybody's sitting down and everybody's studying and looking and they start reading out and all of a sudden you know everybody's kind of quiet and they're just and just I can't even remember how it goes there 45 21 two just seems kind of boring and mundane and all a sudden somebody goes Bingo b I got bingo well hey that that's in the natural I pray while we're reading this something in your heart go Bingo according as he hath chosen Us in him when did he do it before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love Bingo I can't understand it I can't describe it it's a paradox it's incredible but something in my soul says it is true I believe it having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of your your will according to if if you could put it all together according to if if if you were a better person come on come on break out of your shell this morning I know you're going through a hard time I know you got a a lot on your plate but I'm so glad that has no bearing on where you came from it has no bearing on where you're going I don't care how many times you've Fallen how many times you failed everything looks like a mess that you're not going to be able to make it but I say if something in your heart this morning can look into the word of God and just say bingo that's me and I am free because he has chosen me before the foundation of the world that I would be adopted the problem is is we're trying to adopt ourselves you can't adopt yourself quit trying you're trying to make yourself good enough I'm going to make myself to be a good enough son if I can just do this if I can just overcome that if I can just make it over here that trial that I keep coming against I keep failing over and over and over again and just one time if I could just prove that I'm a son well it has no bearing on it you are always a son that's the reason you could be quickened that's the reason you can hear his voice this morning I don't care how bad he looks my sheep hear my voice you hath he quickened when did he do it I say when did he do it why you were in sin and trespasses he had already quickened you he had already made you alive where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy you were back there in him when were you made alive before the foundation of the world you were in him you were in his thinking you were in the Loos oh my well if that's where you come from come on if that's what you're a part of didn't the scripture say ye are Gods to whom the word of the Lord comes to yes and God by Divine promise through Malachi 4:5 has come to you behold I send you Elijah who was this Elijah ministry as I was with Moses so shall I be with you yes it wasn't the man Moses it was the god in Moses it wasn't the man Joshua it was the same pillar fire that led him through the Wilderness that was with Joshua amen oh Hallelujah having predestinated us unto adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved oh hey I'm I'm getting excited I had kind of a little bit rough patch but you know what I'm accepted and the Beloved you know that's that that that's a hard thing in today's society that's a hard thing I tell you even even growing up you young kids and certain ones everybody wants to be accepted it causes complexes it causes hard feelings it causes doubt it causes uh uh trials where I remember as a young young kid I'd be walking around the corner and there would be some girls or boys talking in Spanish and something in my complex just like they're they're talking about me not that I thought anything of myself but it was a complex I was worried about you know I I mean uh do I look a little goofy cuz man I looked goofy I went to a a private school and and my parents doing the best they could until they kicked me out hey we don't want you back man we want your kind around here you're not accepted so I went over to I had to go to a public school my parents were trying their best to to do what they could and so and I started going to a public School sixth grade was my first first a chance in in public school well you know what I wasn't able to wear sweats and a t-shirt to my private school so to me the coolest thing ever was that I could wear sweats and a t-shirt to class so I thought thought I can wear sweats and a t-shirt well you know how cool sweats and a t-shirt is sorry back then it wasn't really cool I wore sweat sweatpants and t-shirt to class like every day well you know I really wasn't that accepted I was a Rowdy one I I I got in a lot of trouble but you know everybody wants to be accepted and I I I think it when it comes to the house of God I think it's a shame when within our own circles that our brothers and sisters don't feel accepted we have people in our youth group who don't feel accepted by other youth I'm sorry about it they ain't cool enough they don't listen to Rock Christian like I do well I'm sorry about it they ain't as trendy and cool they don't wear their skirts as short as I do but you know it goes the other way it goes the other way more than it does that way we wear our skirts to the floor look at them sisters they wear their skirts short so what why don't you be God to them why don't you be you think they want anything you got when you draw them out of your circle and say look at us we're so holy and piest we got it all down they don't want what you got because you ain't got the Life of Christ but if we can just draw the circle bigger come on youth there ain't no big eyes or big little youth it has to be Christ in you the hope of glory looking out and say you know what that young person that's in our young group they're never coming around you know we ought to make an effort to to include them oh be careful prophet of God would tell a story in the Paradox he he he he would come down to many of the end and he this this story meant so much to him one of his friends uh started telling brother brandom I want to ask you something he said uh you believe in a paradox and that's actually that story is what caused the prophet to preach this message six times and he says well sure I do he goes you know there was a time as a druggist where was back in the days of the depression and and and we were just doing the best we could at the times and and this this this young couple came in and he he came in because he wanted to get some medicine for his wife who was with child and ready to give at any time and they didn't have much time and they had to get this medicine they came in uh to the drugas and his boy he was running the counter and they said sir I I I I I I don't have the money to pay for this but we're in we're in a a dire place I I I I got to get this medicine for my wife is is it possible that you could just give me the medicine I I I I'll make it up to you the best I can he said sir I'm sorry we have procedures and policies we just can't do that he said but if you go on down the corner down there's government assistance down over there if you go fill out the papers and all that they they'll be sure to give you the the money so you can come and make the purchase the man didn't have that kind of time but he just looked at him said okay thank you and he turned to go away and his daddy back there the drug us said something just in his heart said wait a minute boy what was that about he's said oh well his wife she's with child and they're ready to deliver and they needed this prescription but they don't have any they don't have any uhh uh money to purchase he said you know you run to tell them to come back he's telling brother brandom he said brother Brandon there he was he he got the prescription all together and he just figured you know we'll be able to make do without it I'll just go ahead and give it to him he says and and as the drug us handed that prescription over into his hand hands as he placed it into the hands that hand opened up he says brother brandom they were nail scarred hands and I saw that it was Jesus Christ he said brother brandom is it crazy do you believe that he said yes I believe that with all of my heart it was a paradox the least you have done unto these you have done unto me how much more those of the household of faith oh there ought to be a sincerity in our heart a sincerity and Truth to have the love of God shed abroad that we would love one another that we would look on the needs of one another that we want them to be accepted and the Beloved but I say if you feel like a cast out you feel like you're unaccepted if you feel like no one's accepted you I got good news this morning if by faith you can look into the word as he has said in he said to the praise and the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the Beloved thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus that when anybody else might not have accepted me the only thing that matters is have you accepted me reminds me of the woman that was caught in adultery they grabbed her and they took her and threw her down at his feet she was condemned to die what a story that is we one by one I say in that presence which one of us is without sin cast the first stone in that presence you think you can show up into that presence into that great light with your works with your piety with your dress code with your experience none of that will do there's only one thing that'll do where are your accusers none but thee Lord and neither do I accuse you no matter how bad it is no matter how far you've gone I don't accuse you blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute in I don't accuse you a matter of fact I say you're forgiven I say you never did it in the first place go and sin no more Hallelujah that's the kind of acceptance I want in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence now I like this one having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself well just put your seat Bel on this whole last day mystery concerns you the book of Ephesians the Book of Joshua is just a perfect parallel and a type of what God is doing in the bride how can one understand it how can one fathom it it's a paradox it's incredible but it's true yes sir so why don't we just move on here from our text now and we'll cover some ground out of a paradox brother Brandon would say say in 65 uh paragraph 57 he says Joshua here in the book actually it's a book of redemption of the Old Testament Joshua we would have to consider it to be that the book of redemption because its Redemption has two parts Redemption anywhere has two parts that is it's out of and into it takes two parts to make Redemption out of into two Moses represented the law which brought them out of Egypt and whereas Joshua represents Grace that took them into the promised land so what took him into the promised land Grace another way the another way was the law and Grace were two different aspects of God's command now the law brought them out Moses and Joshua took them in it also represents something for our day now it represents as they were in the Journey coming out from Egypt into the promised land so have we come out of the world of Egypt Chaos on our road to a promised land in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so I would have told you John 14 coming out and going into if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also where is he where is he you know that's really what everybody's probing at down Through the Ages who is this MDC where is he who is this God where did we come from where are we going he said I will come again I will take you out of the chaos and things that are to be talks about how he he's coming what to take us out of this pest house and into a land where there's no more Wars there's no more sickness there's no more death John 14 but don't miss the mystery he said I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am ye may be also well just keep reading a little bit further down in John 14 it says at that day ye shall know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me then where is he where is he he said I will come again he said I will come again to receive you unto myself oh this is the mission history this is what he had purposed in himself as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about moving us placing us bringing us into the promise making it a reality I will come then who is it that's here it's him the same one the same one that was with Moses the same one that was with Joshua the same one that was with brother brandham the same one under this great mystery in the revelation of the Seven Seals it's now Christ the Capstone coming to the bride God and morphe God conding sin God having fellowship with his attributes so if by faith or by the inspiration we can catch it remember the prophet is saying Ephesians perfectly parallels Joshua the Holy Spirit now moving us into the promised land see we really didn't even know what our promised land was it took a profit this book was sealed it was a mystery and it took the Joshua Ministry of our day to be able to take us in and start to describe us the boundaries to start to open up the word and say this is yours this is yours this is your inheritance this is all for you so remember the parallel now right you you get into your Bible in Genesis 15 is is when God gave Abraham the promise he gave him boundaries and descriptions of the promised land he said Abraham I I have given thee in thy seed this land from the from the Great River uh of Egypt all the way to the river Euphrates oh from there to there all the way way to the sea to the going down of the sun all of this inheritance is yours now we could look onto a map and we could start to maybe uh draw it all out and we could actually see with maybe our natural eye or get an idea of what the promised land was what the description was of the land that God had given to Abraham now remember we're talking about a parallel of Ephesians and Joshua of them possessing that land that was given unto Abraham well in your mind it's it's it's easy maybe to get an idea of what the promised land was to Abraham but now when it comes to the parallel for you what is your Promised Land what is your promise we have to look into the word and by revelation by the Elijah Ministry or the Joshua Ministry of this day by Revelation has to bring us in and reveal to us what our promised land is because without that it's a mystery it's veiled we we we we're just probing we're just presuming we're just wandering EXC we're just trying to do our best and trying to make a way for ourselves but I want to Anchor this down a familiar scripture a as he says that footsteps were possession right they had a natural land just walk into there get them feet get the souls of them feet on that land and it's yours now it's a perfect parallel in our scripture and our Bible tells us in second Corinthians 5:7 we walk by faith not by sight so I'm trying to preach a little bit this morning on footsteps of faith that by faith you can walk walk through the word oh thank you Lord Jesus and you can possess the promises that God has given unto you look your carnal mind's going to fail you that's right you are being led by the spirit of almighty God as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I thought about what a comfort that was to Joshua you imagine all right man it's time to go take the land that'd be a lot of pressure and responsibility like well Lord I know you've given me the given me the promise but I've seen this stiff neck people you know Moses got angry and smoked the Rock and they're always murmuring and complaining but what did he tell them as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee maybe Joshua starting to think my there we were in Egypt under them task Masters and there came them plagues one after another after another and God brought us out by a mighty hand and we come to the Red Sea and we were stuck on nowhere to go seemed like we were doomed and ready to be perished as all the people murmured and complained have you brought us out here to die Moses and then God by a mighty hand come down and parted the Red Sea and brought us through on dry land and got the unbeliever so puffed up in themselves they thought they could follow where a believer's footsteps went no that was a provided way for the children of Israel and God swallowed up the enemy and maram took that tambourine and started to rejoice and dance upon the banks say oh our enemy our Taskmaster is dead and Moses would uh write that song uh great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints you've overcome the horse and a Trier you've swallowed up the enemy they got out there and had uh Bitter Water they mured and a complain they got hungry and man I came down out of the sky and every time they come to a place they had a need actually see Joshua saying you know what you'll be with me Lord if you've brought me this far if you have brought me this far then surely Lord you will bring me all the way and Joshua was anointed Joshua was anointed to take the land Joshua was so anointed that one day he had a need right one day Joshua had an e he said Son stand still brother Brandon would speak about that in the Paradox his daughter Rebecca would comes like Daddy you know according to I mean you know the sun you know it's kind of already still it's not our science books and everything ain't kind of said it's it's the Earth spinning the sun standing still and what place he say honey I don't know all I knows he said it in other places he says it in an need he says it wasn't so much that missile out there I'm like huh he said it was the light coming from it that he needed like so so so the light the sun had admitted is what he was telling to stay stay huh it's a paradox I can't figure it out alls I know is Joshua had a need he was given a promise he was in the line of duty he was there according to the word of God and he said Son stand still and the Sun and the Moon and the Earth had to obey because there was a son of God walking in his commission I say there's sons and daughters in the house of God that are right now walking in their commission not something that you've done but you are the accepted and the Beloved you have been predestinated you have been gathered together by a shout that is why you are here not something that you can do it is something that he has already done it is something that he is doing in The Bride of Jesus Christ son stand still well that sounds pretty good Matthew but you know I I'm just a housewife I'm just a professional [Music] student I'm not a warrior like Joshua I'm not a preacher I don't have position in the church what does that even mean position between four walls are going to burn I'm interested in the position that God's [Music] given you think your position in the natural has anything to do it makes me think of that story I can't help it they come by the plantation say why is he different from everybody else I wondered myself is it his position come on did you elevate him did you feed him better do you treat him better I often wondered my that myself but I found out in another land across the sea he's the son of a king he acts like it he talks like it he conducts himself like it I don't care what your job is you ought to act like the son and daughter of a king like that one girl who threw out the wash waterer what was her position all the step sisters and everybody were laughing at her as she was preparing to be married H you ain't got no inheritance you ain't gotten nothing she had something more than any of them had she had a promise I will meet you there Hallelujah her position was in the promise not in what Society granted not what what anybody else could give oh Joshua could do that because you know he was a great Mighty General he had position in the church he had office was okay Prophet would pick that up and say you know some 1,400 years ago in Jericho about 10 miles from the spot where Joshua spoke to the son there was a little wretched beggar he was poor he was blind what position did he have what influence on society did he have he couldn't walk into the church house or the S look at me he couldn't go into the dinner halls and and have Prestige and all this no he he was just an outcast he was just on the side of the road he was just a dirty poor little blind wretched beggar but none of that none of that had anything to do as his position in the word because there in them streets of Jericho all of that noise and all of that commotion was going on he screamed out thou son of David have mercy on me and the prophet said the same faith that Joshua stopped the sun with blind barname stopped the so n of God oh it doesn't take some prestigious position it takes a son or a daughter of God to speak the name of Jesus why don't you speak the name of Jesus thou Lord over all creation I have a need have mercy on me yes amen Prophet said he stopped the so n in his tracks with the same kind of faith that Joshua had now just form all these things in your heart that we've been talking about time is not a real thing time shall be no more Hallelujah I got quotes to back it up now for a few more moments and a few more I I I want you to meditate on this now because we think of these parallels these paradoxes this is pertaining to you right Joshua blind bmus Moses Ephesians all of these things they're laying in there for you so much so that I like this the prophet of God would say in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he'd say the entire Bible Hallelujah is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had that's right one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible now this part right here just Wows me and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it everything you're looking in parallels paradoxes the Patriarchs the disciples all the acts of all the Believers everything remember he's the I am yes sir he's an I am present God don't don't be looking in the future and just look to what has been but what is he do he's the same yesterday today and forever if he does something one way if you can catch the inspiration of it if he does something one way he has to do it the same way every if he brought them out by a mighty hand then the Same Spirit the same Pillar of Fire is here to take you out of the chaos I love those quotes brother br will say at that day that that's this day you shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you I've heard it a million times brother Matthew but I'm I have a hard time catching the inspiration catching the Revelation well it's it's a paradox it's something that's incredible but it's true and by faith you can walk right into the promises of God look you are not alone you are not alone this is not you vers the world this is not how you can figure your way out of your problems he didn't lead the children of Israel out of Egypt and and there to the Red Sea with their back against the Red Sea and saying now figure this one out Moses Moses responsibility was to wait upon the Lord he said be still and know that I am God maybe if the voice of God speak to one of you this morning be still be still and no this ain't your problem this is my problem I said I would be an enemy to your enemies that I would be an adversary to your adversary the same God that was with Moses the same God that was with Joshua yes sir what did he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you how is that even possible and who's this MDC brother Brandon say God and morphe mashed in the pillar of fire god and morphe in a man called Jesus God and morphe in his church God above us God With Us and God in us by faith now this morning oh if if you could open up your heart and by faith receive the inspiration of God positionally placing you in the word in the Statue of a perfect man the prophet says but a body thou Hast prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see it God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentally of God God walking on two feet in you well just believe it I know we're not in a bingo hall but maybe it should look like it not your neighbor right I'mma read it again a that God can dwell and God can walk and God can see and God can talk and God can work and amen living instrumentally of God God walking on two feet I say as y'all get up this morning and start to walk out y'all just look at your neighbor say there goes God on two feet there goes God on two feet there goes God on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God God walking in you for ye are written Epistles of all men and the life that's in Christ is to be in you and you'll bear the life that Christ bore that's not a challenge church that's a promise that's not a see if you can it's watch what I do Hallelujah we are living in the Mount Zion show we've had a mount Karma we've had a mount transfig this is a Mount Zion Showdown the Rapture of the Bride just watch them workall watch what my God just stand still just stay around a little while you think I'm in trouble you think I'm cast down you think I got a hard time no sir I am the accepted in the Beloved I have been predestinated I have have been quickened I will come to you at that day that's this day he said I will go and prepare a place for you and I will come again I say he has come Christ The Mighty conqueror he has come the Capstone has descended that where I am Hallelujah you may be also in that day when the Revelation comes forth I be in the Father the father in me I in you and you and me God in Mor walking on two feet Glory Hallelujah Bingo you called my number Call Me Gone H call me gone you think I got trouble yeah I got trouble you think I got hearted yeah I got hearted right you think I got sickness sure I have some sickness watch my God work the same God that part of the Red Sea same God that fed him in the wilderness the same Pillar of Fire that come down on the Ohio River in 1933 it said as John the Baptist foran the first coming of Christ so shall your ministry forun the second coming of Jesus Christ brother R would preach Christ The Mystery of God revealed I believe it is it's how you are spiritual look back at the clock it's 2 o00 on the dot what is he talking about it was 2 o00 on the Ohio River 1933 as John the Baptist forrun the first coming of Jesus Christ so shall your ministry forrun the second coming of Jesus Christ he's saying here he is Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world the I am is here that's a promise he's given to you David would say teach me thy way oh Lord lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies he would say in Psalms Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path the devil's always wanting you to reason with the word always wanting to try to make you doubt lead me in a plain path the word is your path the word is your light you know your life has a predestinated path the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord I know the scripture says the footsteps of a good man but my Prophet said righteous over and over footsteps of righteous are order of the Lord look the there there's a rest I'm going try by God's grace we'll try to come to a close here and speak of this but there is a rest for the people of God hallu and our Joshua the Holy Spirit the person of the word is here present amongst us to take you into that rest where you can live in his presence now that's a paradox I'm sorry it's a paradox I it can't be made any more plain than it's already been made there's no more Mysteries it's all been revealed the the mercy seats in plain view it's it's not a mystery right but it's a paradox and a paradox is something that's incredible but true and we walk by faith not by sight and so just in and moving towards a close here just using the children of Israel as that parallel if you if you look at the children of Israel they had a provided way they had a provided path but how many of them failed to enter into that rest think of it now now for a few moments we just want to have a little sobriety the prophet of God would say in in Paradox 65 and paragraph 79 he says now if we notice then their journey in the wilderness is where they got their greatest mistake that Israel ever made until Calvary was when in Exodus 19 they accepted law instead of Grace now you can go read the whole chapter of uh of Exodus 19 and it might be a very challenging thing to find where they made their mistake but it would take a prophet of God to be able to take that connection and preach a message the church choosing law for Grace and what was their greatest mistake you read through it and and God speaks to Moses and comes to them and says and gives them the word of the Lord say thou if you do all these things and the children of say all that thou has said that we will do they missed something you stiff neck people with all the murmuring and complaining and y'all you y'all are going to fulfill the word it took a prophet to say that's where they made their greatest mistake is when they say we will do all that the word says He says they chose law over Grace they said there's something we can do in it now it sounded pretty good to me but it took a prophet to say it should have been oh Lord all that thou said if it'll be by your grace Lord in myself I'm weak Lord there's no way that I can fulfill this word there's no way I can F this fulfill this message Lord but if it would be you by your grace the same Grace that provided us a lamb the same Grace that provided us a prophet the same Grace that took us out of Egypt the same Grace that gave us water the same Grace that gave us Mana that same Grace if it would be that Grace Lord then I can do all that thou has spoken but Lord don't give me law give me Grace they accepted law instead of Grace he said they had Grace they had a prophet they had a sacrificial lamb they had Redemption they had been brought through the Red Sea they had been healed of their diseases they had water from the smitten Rock now brother brandom's not given a history lesson here he's talking to me he's talking to me saying son you see what they did take take heed son take heed that it's not you trying to fulfill my word cuz if it's you you're choosing Law stay with me for a few more moments they had a smid rock they had Man Out Of Heaven everything they had need of had been supplied and still they wanted something else do not chalk this off to something in a day gone by this is the Living Word which is a reality a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart we go have an experience and we get all whooped up and we and it's good I ain't saying it's wrong I've been there man I've been set free and got wings of an eagle I'm just soaring around with so much Zeal and all those older eagles with wisdom are looking I look at that poor little fellow thinks he's done something think I can go out there on All My Own Strength few storms come and blow you down you realize okay I thought I could fly Lord it was your grace that put me up there in the first place Amen brother random tells a story about how some man he he had all of his notes and he had everything packed together real well and he he come up man he had just the word of the Lord and he come up and he presented it really well to them simple Pentecostal people and man he was just up there and he was framing all the words and tying all the quotes together and my he just had it right down but he he realized them simple Holy Ghost filled uh folks weren't having it shut up his books and his notes and put his head down and started to walk out the back door and one of the old Saints looked over and said you know if he' had went up the way he come down it have been different yeah sincerity if you're going to speak to the mountain if you're going to speak to the storm you must be more sincere Ephesians does parallel Joshua you are doing the Greater Works and we shall do more we must be more sincere now that's a perfect type of our Ephesians today we'll try to close quickly now that's a perfect type of our Ephesians today exactly we come out under Luther we went through sanctification under the methodists and came into the restoration under Pentecost exactly like it was the Wilderness journey and when God brought us out we did everything well but what did we do we wanted to be like the rest of them now we find out that Grace is the only thing that takes us through never the law they wanted something that they could do they wanted some type of Sabbath they wanted some type of ordinance Prophet said if there's one thing that you could have done to save yourself then not one spec of its Grace Prophet goes on to say Joshua here is a type of the last day Ministry see now remember those three stages of the journey all of it ceased first the law and everything had to cease and Joshua is the same word as Jesus Jehovah savior that took them from their Wilderness into their Promised Land I'm so thankful to be walking with him it ain't I that liveth but it's Christ that liveth with me I want to ask you what more do you want that's what he said what more do you want our Joshua our Christ the revealed word of the hour is here to take you through what more do you want which one of you can add one cubit to your stature if we're not careful we want something we can do right but we are what we are by the grace of God not one of us can add one cubit to our statue I was just thinking about having a little fellowship with brother Dar and we we were we're talking about uh uh uh 1 Corinthians 13 where and I I just was thinking about Paul how he comes through and says look you you can you can know all the Mysteries you you you can give your body to be burned you can feed the poor you you can prophesy you can speak in tongues you can do all these things you could know all the Mysteries but if you don't have charity it just struck my heart it was a perfect a perfect type well let me rephrase that I don't want to say that but I I saw a wonderful picture of the church ages of how God building up all through the church ages God building up God adding Here Comes justification justification was good we needed justification a sanctification was good we had to be Sanctified the restoration of the gifts was good that's all wonderful that's all part of it but what is Charity charity is love it's the Capstone what good does it do us if we have all of that and we don't have him right oh it's Christ coming down living amongst us few more moments brother brandom says in the Paradox he says so there was Joshua representing Grace was right along with law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place and so has the church World in this day it's come along it's played its part but there is coming a time where it must cease it must do it there has got to be an Ephesians of this journey and just as there was of those Journeys there has to come an Ephesians and Ephesus and Ephesians of this journey where are we at where are we at we are not we are in our Ephesians not a not an Ephesian Church age but Christ himself the restoration that was the purpose of Malachi 4:5 was to restore us back to the original Faith where the same God that was in Christ Jesus was poured out into the church and it was no more you that was living but it's Christ in you that's living Christ coming down to perform the work I'll just invite the musicians Paul would say in Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them part of the problem is we don't know what we have we don't even really know what we've we've we've sunk our teeth into I was thinking about that a little bit you know just give me a few minutes sister sorry I won't be too long I was thinking about that a little bit how you ever seen a baby pick up a pair of scissors or a knife or something all of a sudden somehow they got somewhere and they picked up something they shouldn't have that baby's just like look at me I'm so cute and everybody's like like whoa because that baby doesn't understand what it's holding it doesn't know what it's capable of with that right doesn't even know how to use it right you know that's how the devil looks at you like boy they got the message they're packing the message he's over there going he's like guys we got to we got to keep them from recognizing who they are if I can just keep the bride from recognizing who they really are in Christ she'll never raise up into her position of what she really is on come on it reminds me of it reminds me of Joshua right when he he he he went in to conquer Canaan what do you say hey man kill them all I don't care how cute that baby looks that little baby that little Amite it'll grow up into a big Amite I think that's some of our problems we're just petting little babies of the world we think they're okay oh it's just so cute and innocent it's just a Love Me Jesus song yeah go go look at your love me Jesus song and the people singing it you want to identify with that I heard a song and so I thought you know hey I'll I typed in the words and the most provocative album cover I I couldn't even imagine and I realized why my skin was crawling when I was hearing it oh sounded great you think that stuff's there to draw you closer to Christ or to give you a taste of the world yeah I got a good dose of that years ago about 20 something years ago I borrowed a car and uh you know I mean I'm not saying there was anything wrong with the song but God just allowed it to get my attention um and it was some believers they put together a song it kind of had uh um well I didn't even know it I pulled up to pick somebody up and I turned the car off and when you turn the car back on the CD would automatically start playing and it was it was a good Christian family but this was just gave me some perspective and so the CD came in on and always ready playing and and I went to pick up a a friend of mine son and he came up and opened up the door and he got in goes I didn't know you listen to country music I I well I was like well that would I wouldn't listen to that but that's that's actually it was food for thought though some of that stuff we listen to I don't know why we got over here but some of that stuff we listen to sounds just the same as the world but I say oh God I want to be sincere I want to be sober well just start playing and that's usually how this goes to make me wind down the devil's trying to keep you from believing in who you are I I want to Anchor this down brother random says now that that's where people think today of Divine Healing or some any other work of grace of God that there is something that you have to do there is nothing you have to do but believe just believe God and if they would have just continued on the promise wasn't given them under the law the promise was given before the law without any condition of it I have given you this land go on over into it but before they got to that promise they decided there was something they must do themselves and we still find that among human beings we're prone to be that way there is something we've got to do we feel that we've we've got to have something into it also you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will your own ideas to the will and idea of almighty God and it's finished that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and God does the rest of it as I was with Moses so shall I also be with you just take his [Music] promise don't think anything else of it walk by it and God does the rest now maybe you feel like that man of Mark 9 where Jesus he brought his son he was all frolicking throwing hisself Into the Fire and the prophet would identify that was epilepsy and he he he comes to him said Lord I brought my son uh to the disciples you know they weren't able to deliver him he said oh you you faithless generation how long should I be with him bring him unto me bring him unto me I struck my heart he's still here he's still the same yesterday today bring your problems unto me bring them unto me I am here yes if thou can't believe all things are possible the father Cried Out said oh God I believe but help my [Music] unbelief if you believe why don't you just stand say Lord I believe I realize I've had mistakes I realize I've had failures we'll finish on this quote now I I just want to speak to somebody's heart really quick and I pray that you can pull out of this what the prophet is saying remember parallels and paradoxes footsteps of faith brother Brandon picks up the St story of Jonah it says many people think that Jonah was a terrible person Jonah was a prophet of the Lord walking in all the will of the Lord you say why did he do that he never done anything contrary to God's will now this is a paradox to me you can't if you are in Christ do anything contrary if you're walking humbly and upright it may seem like you do but you don't do it now don't you realize this is Grace speaking nothing happens providential nothing the footsteps of the righteous man is order of the Lord and all things work together for the good to them that love him how can you take those scriptures and compare them with any other and break them the scriptures cannot be broken I end on this Jonah looked like a backslidden prophet looked like he was out of the will of God looked like he sharked his responsibility and his duty and what looked like his mistake and his failure the Lord Jesus would stand there and say there will be no sign given you save the sign of Jonah what if I could say in my heart there's perfection in Redemption amen that God could stand here and look at the bride what you think is mistakes and failures what you think is you messing everything else is God saying in your Ephesians and you hath he quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses this message is the grace of God to you everywhere The Souls of your feet go it's possession footsteps is possession that's the same thing today Divine Healing belongs to us the Holy Spirit belongs to us it's our property but you'll fight every inch of it but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil says the days of Miracles has passed you say you're a liar Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever take it over he everywhere your footsteps that's possession Heavenly Father we approach you and the most mighty name the most wonderful name that's ever been on the lips of mortal man the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's in that name that we approach you Lord we've triy to just say a little of what you plac on our heart [Music] Lord Lord we want this word to be a living reality your presence amongst us we can look into the Bible we can see the Troubles of Israel on their Wilderness Journey we can see the sin in the camp as they would cross over in the land and have troubles and lose a victory but all of that Lord was just parallels and types of you speaking to our heart and showing us that you're the great Jehovah savior you're our captain you're our leader you're the mighty conqueror you are here present with us to take us into all the promises we just want to surrender this morning Lord I Surrender by Heart Lord I Surrender my mind I Surrender my thoughts and ideas Lord and by faith now I say I believe Lord and if I believe lord it's not even my own faith but it's the faith that you has given me Lord with every head bowed there's somebody here that just wants special prayer and you feel like you're in a place and you need you need the Divine hand of God to reach down to you and perform something Supernatural in life and give you a supernatural vehicle Victory is there somebody here that would want to raise up their hand not everybody just those that really have a special request needing the supernatural God bless [Music] you Lord Jesus you see the hands that are represented here Lord I don't know their condition I don't know their [Music] heart but Lord I just know what your word says Lord you said I will come to you I will comfort you Lord there's some here that need comfort they have a broken heart there's some here that are scared they're afraid of what tomorrow holds Lord but by faith Lord right [Music] now we can rest because you said there is a rest for the people of God and as you were with Moses as you were with Joshua Lord as you were with our great prophet that you sent in in the end time but you've given us the same promise that as you were with him I'll be with you I'll be in you it won't be you living but it'll be me living in you Lord thank you for keeping [Music] us it's your grace Lord while we're here it's your mercy while we're here Lord nothing that we have done we would have thrown in the tow years ago we would have given up years ago Lord but there's something that keeps holding us Lord we would have given up Lord and many times we have given up Lord but you've never given up you've been right here the whole time it's been you the whole time it's been your grace it's been your mercy it's been your love Lord there's nothing we could do to Warrant Your Grace it's been you Lord Lord I don't want some law I don't want something I can do Lord I just need your grace and I'm asking Lord that your grace would now just sweep amongst your people Lord deliver the captive for you said you would bind up the Brokenhearted for you said you would Lord set at Liberty the captive Lord for you said that you would Lord I just pray pray these blessings upon your people now in Jesus Christ's name I ask it Amen brother Billy if you'd come let's just sing sing that song and

spoken to you this morning is the god of parallel and of paradoxes I just want to just say that for a moment when you see the parallel don't forget the Paradox many people see the parallel but they run without the Paradox the whole Bible is built on Parallel and paradoxes many churches may see the parallel well it said he will do this he'll do it again but don't forget the Paradox the Paradox is the manner by which he chooses to do it the parado ask is how am I going to move from here and get over there I don't understand the parallel shows me that it exists I'll just take the parallel and wait upon the Paradox to take me there how do I receive the Holy Ghost he said just believe I'll believe I'll walk like it I'll do what I know I'm going to wait until the Paradox takes me from what I am and changes me don't run without the paradox let I'll tell you this we didn't make ourselves see the parallel he he laid it down in the scriptures he said if I did one thing one time I'll do it again if I healed one time I'll heal again God has never done one thing and not do it again every time he does it it's it's based on the parallel so his believing children will be able to see that he the same yesterday today and forever but in that the Paradox is he makes it happen not you but he makes it happen that's right oh I want to come this morning oh like the woman with the blood issue and say father I'm here I've had this issue that's bothered me for years I don't know what to do about it but I know in the scripture there was a woman who came and attached the Hem of your garment and she was completely healed I don't know how you did it but all I know is if I can touch your word if I can touch what you spoken the same God who brought the same Paradox by the same parallel he will heal me too don't run without the Paradox let the parallel Let The God Who made the parallel come and take the Paradox into your life make it a reality to me take my life I I'm struggling I don't understand where I am I don't understand what's happening but I know that you do things your way you do things the way that nobody else can you you the one who washed me from all uncleanness I'm in the church today I'm hearing what I'm hearing because you made me what I am but now I'm praying that you can take me here I didn't put the desire to be right in my own heart I didn't choose to be a Christian I didn't choose to serve you you chose me to serve you I see the parallel that you have in your Bible I'm coming so the Paradox can happen in my life Hall he's the god of paradoxes he does things only the way he can do that's our heart's desire and if you need prayer just come Alber will'll pray for you I don't know about you I need a paradox this morning for all the types that I've seen in the Bible for all the types that I'm reading it I need the god of paradox to take that this morning and bring it into a reality amen just give me the key of see let's sing that D let's try it
