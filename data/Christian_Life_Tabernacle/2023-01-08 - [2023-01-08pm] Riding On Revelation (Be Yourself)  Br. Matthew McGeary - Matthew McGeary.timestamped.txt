[38:41] here in our home church so uh just
[38:44] continue to remember our pastor
[38:46] pray strength for him
[38:49] and just looking uh knowing that God
[38:52] will will rot a mighty work and I'm
[38:54] looking forward to the Revelation and
[38:56] the continuing leading from our Shepherd
[38:58] amen Revelations chapter 6 we're just
[39:01] going to try to jump in
[39:04] um
[39:05] right into the middle of a thought if
[39:07] you will and just by God's help we'll
[39:09] we'll move through this but Revelations
[39:11] chapter 6 verse 7 and 8 would read like
[39:15] this and when he had opened the fourth
[39:18] seal
[39:19] I heard the voice
[39:21] of the fourth Beast say come and see
[39:25] and I look and behold a Pale Horse and
[39:27] his name that sat on him was death and
[39:30] Hell Followed With Him and power was
[39:33] given unto them over the fourth part of
[39:35] the earth to kill with the sword and
[39:37] with hunger and with death
[39:40] and with the Beast of the earth and you
[39:43] if you'll also turn over to Revelations
[39:44] 10 we'll read verse 7 I I just in
[39:48] reading this I if you notice as uh
[39:51] uh John here is caught up
[39:54] um and the seals are are being spoken to
[39:57] him there's four beasts and they're
[39:58] saying uh come and see and he and he
[40:01] would say and I I and I heard and I
[40:04] heard and the Beast saying and I like
[40:06] how on the fourth Beast
[40:09] it's it's the one Beast that eagle Beast
[40:12] he actually says I I like how it's
[40:14] worded there
[40:16] um how he says and I Heard a Voice
[40:19] and just in Reading Revelations 10 verse
[40:22] 7 it says but in the days of The Voice
[40:25] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[40:26] to sound the mystery of God should be
[40:29] finished if he had declared to his
[40:30] servants the prophets amen you may be
[40:32] seated we pray a blessing on the reading
[40:34] of the word now just jumping right into
[40:36] this a thought here we're going to read
[40:38] a portion out of the fifth seal so just
[40:41] bear with us if you can try to pull some
[40:44] of the things that you're familiar with
[40:45] and if some of the things seem broken up
[40:49] uh go go listen to the fifth seal and um
[40:53] just continue to study and by God's
[40:55] grace some of these things can be a
[40:56] benefit to you the prophet of God would
[40:58] say this in the fifth seal you'd say uh
[41:01] the the four stages of his writer has
[41:04] been revealed the four stages of the
[41:07] Antichrist writing and has been revealed
[41:10] at this time therefore they don't have
[41:12] uh they don't have to have anymore and
[41:15] there was four living creatures of God
[41:18] to announce the writers that rode for
[41:22] Beast our four powers now we know that a
[41:26] beast by interpretation of the terms of
[41:29] the Bible symbol means power now let's
[41:32] get that close the four Beast
[41:35] in the Bible represents a power among
[41:38] the people so he's pointing out there's
[41:41] four beasts that were riding even uh you
[41:43] had the White Horse the red horse the
[41:46] black horse The Pale Horse he's saying a
[41:48] beast represents power than the prophet
[41:51] of God would go on to start talking
[41:52] about Daniel and saying Daniel in the
[41:54] dreams and the Visions he would he would
[41:57] see uh maybe a a a a bear that with a
[42:01] rib and then he'd see a goat he'd see a
[42:03] lion with teeth and and he would see all
[42:05] of these things and the prophet would
[42:07] take the time to show how when he would
[42:09] see these beasts it would be
[42:10] representing a power it'd be Nations and
[42:12] Powers rising up and and one of them
[42:15] being the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar so
[42:17] he's showing here that the symbol in the
[42:20] uh uh Book of Revelation here is
[42:22] represented in power and he's showing
[42:25] how it represents a National Power or a
[42:28] nation he's also showing that it
[42:30] represents the power of the devil and he
[42:32] comes on down into paragraph 98 and he's
[42:34] says it also represents holy power a
[42:38] beast did you know that notice Rebecca
[42:41] when the servant Abraham Eliza when he
[42:43] came to get Rebecca he mounted her upon
[42:46] a camel the very camel she watered as
[42:50] she rode this camel to meet her unseen
[42:53] bridegroom the very thing she watered
[42:56] was the thing that took her to her
[42:58] future home and her husband and it's the
[43:01] same thing today I like that now the
[43:04] prophet of God has shown you and typed
[43:05] there in the Old Testament just as there
[43:08] was a power to carry Rebecca to her
[43:11] bridegroom he's showing it's the same
[43:13] thing today the very thing that the
[43:16] church is watering that is the seed the
[43:19] seed of the word it is the very word
[43:21] that becomes alive and Carries us to our
[43:25] unseen bridegroom well I just want to
[43:28] buy the grace of God speak to you a
[43:29] little bit tonight on writing on
[43:31] Revelation we're riding on Revelation I
[43:34] tell you we're riding on the revelation
[43:36] of the Seven Seals we're riding on the
[43:38] revelation of the revealed word in this
[43:40] hour we're being carried by Revelation
[43:43] and I don't know if we might get to this
[43:46] uh if we'll have the time to but as a
[43:48] subject I I just want to say Be Yourself
[43:51] be what God Made You Be Yourself but
[43:53] just in this thought of writing on
[43:55] Revelation will continue a reading here
[43:57] in the fifth seal he doesn't notice as
[43:59] the Antichrist went for on his Beast of
[44:02] ministry there God sent forth a beast to
[44:06] combat it
[44:07] amen who were students of the word we've
[44:10] studied it we've listened to the church
[44:11] ages we've listened to the seal we know
[44:13] that that Antichrist Spirit went out
[44:16] warring and against the church and now
[44:19] he's saying and God sent forth a beast
[44:21] to combat it see now watch then every
[44:24] time the Beast wrote on his horse the
[44:27] Antichrist rode on his horse on his
[44:29] Beast to announce his ministry God sent
[44:32] his Beast also and he was on that to
[44:36] announce his combat to it now the
[44:39] scripture says when the enemy comes in
[44:41] like a flood the spirit of God raises a
[44:44] standard against him and so when the
[44:47] enemy went out as an antichrist God sent
[44:51] a certain type of power to meet him
[44:55] amen he said a certain type of power to
[44:59] meet him so every time you see this
[45:00] Antichrist Spirit uh writing it's being
[45:03] represented and obese it's being
[45:05] represented in a horse rider and now
[45:07] there's a power or or another Beast that
[45:10] God sends to combat it and as we know
[45:12] it's those four beasts the four beasts
[45:14] that guarded the gospel it well it was
[45:17] The Lion and the ox and the man and the
[45:19] eagle and he goes on to say this in
[45:21] paragraph 91 uh 191 and we might be
[45:24] moving a little fast so we'll try to
[45:26] slow down
[45:31] we'll get there
[45:36] so just reading in paragraph 191 it says
[45:39] then he raised up another Power
[45:42] he sent a power to meet it
[45:45] then he raised up another Power he sent
[45:48] another power to meet it and then at the
[45:51] last power he brings down the eagle to
[45:54] restore the children back to the
[45:56] original Faith again of their fathers
[45:59] the eagle age then you notice there is
[46:01] no more beast that's all of it that's
[46:03] the end now if you would take now
[46:05] Revelations 10 1 7 I've been referring
[46:09] to it remember in the last message age
[46:11] see what's to happen all the mysteries
[46:14] of God would be revealed the eagle amen
[46:17] so notice he says when the enemy comes
[46:20] in like a flood the spirit of God raises
[46:22] up a standard against it and just my
[46:25] what just was on my heart is how uh the
[46:28] prophet of God was was showing that in
[46:31] type with Rebecca how she was writing a
[46:34] power to meet her bridegroom and God has
[46:37] sent a power in this age not only to
[46:40] combat the Antichrist Spirit not only to
[46:43] war against it not only to make you and
[46:45] over Overcomer not only to give you a
[46:47] power to withstand The Wiles of the
[46:49] devil but God has sent her power God has
[46:52] sent a revelation to the Bride of Jesus
[46:55] Christ and it is that revelation of the
[46:57] age it is that Revelation and that power
[46:59] that has come and captivated a bride it
[47:02] is apprehended you in that very
[47:04] Revelation that very power that has been
[47:07] poured out upon the Bride of Jesus
[47:09] Christ has now taken you and it's taken
[47:12] you somewhere look he didn't come to
[47:14] leave you here there is a power that has
[47:17] come there is a revelation that has come
[47:19] to the Bride of Jesus Christ not only to
[47:21] make you Victorious not only to make you
[47:24] a conqueror not only to make you be able
[47:26] to withstand The Wiles of the devil but
[47:28] this power is transforming you this
[47:31] power is changing you and this power is
[47:34] taking you from one dimension to another
[47:36] dimensional don't you know church that
[47:38] there is a power here to change your
[47:40] body there's a power here to take you
[47:42] into the Rapture there is a power here
[47:44] to take you oh it's an unseen power it's
[47:47] an unseen Force but just as Rebecca was
[47:50] riding upon that Camel it was packing
[47:52] her to a place that she would see her
[47:54] bridegroom and we arrived in a
[47:56] revelation we are riding in a power
[47:59] right into the presence of our
[48:00] bridegroom
[48:01] oh Hallelujah we'll see him one of these
[48:04] days we know he's here we know he's with
[48:06] us he knows he's in us but one of his
[48:08] great and wonderful days we're gonna see
[48:10] him oh in a meeting of the air just to
[48:12] look upon his face the one who saved me
[48:15] by his grace oh I can't wait church just
[48:18] any day it could be tomorrow it could be
[48:21] next week it could be tonight but I tell
[48:23] you it gots to be a power that has taken
[48:26] over your life to bring you into that
[48:28] place
[48:32] notice the Beast represents a holy power
[48:35] First Peter 1 verse 3 says
[48:39] blessed be the god
[48:41] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:43] which according to His abundant Mercies
[48:48] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[48:51] hope
[48:51] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
[48:54] the dead
[48:57] to an inheritance incorruptible
[49:00] and undefiled
[49:02] and that fadeth not away
[49:04] reserved in heaven for you

[49:43] wrote your name on the Lamb's Book of
[49:44] Life and said I'm making a river a

[53:04] I'm somebody I was the grace of God it
[53:06] was the power of God something was
[53:08] looking out of your life because you are
[53:11] predestinated seed of God that had to
[53:13] meet the challenge for the age that God
[53:16] had written your name on the Lamb's Book
[53:18] of Life and there's been a power keeping
[53:20] you don't you realize that that power
[53:22] what wasn't looking out over you just
[53:23] when you were born
[53:25] that power was looking over your mama
[53:27] and your daddy and your grandpa your
[53:30] great grandpa all the way down God has
[53:32] been looking on over that natural seed
[53:34] he knew exactly who you would be he knew
[53:36] exactly what you would look like he knew
[53:38] exactly the troubles he knew exactly the
[53:41] Temptation he knew exactly the complexes
[53:43] and the depressions and the battles and
[53:46] the self-esteem and all the things that
[53:48] you would face he knew how bad it would
[53:50] get he would knew when you'd be laying
[53:51] there on your back and you'd be crying
[53:53] out for him there was a power Hallelujah
[53:56] there is a power keeping the Bride of
[53:58] Jesus Christ I don't know about you but
[54:00] I get excited about it because it was
[54:02] left to my own ability I would be dead
[54:05] if it was left of my wants and my abuse
[54:07] I'd be in a jail cell somewhere oh but
[54:10] thanks be to God there's been a power
[54:12] that's I've been looking all over my
[54:14] life
[54:15] the power of God
[54:18] oh I feel a little beside myself I've
[54:21] been kept by a power
[54:23] and when you catch that Revelation and
[54:25] you realize you're riding on the
[54:27] revelation of something that God is
[54:29] doing in you
[54:32] then let it come
[54:34] Let The Trials come
[54:37] look if he took care of you when you
[54:38] were out there
[54:40] come on dad
[54:42] if he took care of you when you were out
[54:44] there living in sin when he took care
[54:47] about you out there when you were in
[54:48] drugs and alcohol if he took care of you
[54:51] out there when you ain't even trying to
[54:52] serve him what about now Church what
[54:55] about now that you've surrendered your
[54:56] life you've planned the blood of Jesus
[54:58] Christ and you've come to the Revelation
[55:00] that there's a power that is keeping me
[55:05] time to tell all that Old Devil to shut
[55:07] up and to back up
[55:09] I'm tired of you trying to rob me I'm a
[55:11] Son of God I'm heir to all things I'm
[55:14] heir to my joy I'm here to my peace I'm
[55:17] heir to everything that God has given me
[55:19] and I'm here to take it back
[55:22] we were having some fellowship on it I
[55:24] can't remember the sermon quite right
[55:26] now but brother random starts preaching
[55:28] to somebody he says look you
[55:31] who don't have the Holy Ghost
[55:34] and you don't even know anything about
[55:36] it now I better watch out we start
[55:38] running inspiration I'm on a short a
[55:41] short clock tonight
[55:47] brother Brandon starts speaking to
[55:48] somebody now we always got to think we
[55:50] ought to be all buttoned up I'm ready to
[55:52] receive the word now
[55:54] brother Branham looks out he says now
[55:56] you I'm talking to somebody now you who
[55:59] don't even have the Holy Ghost and you
[56:01] don't know nothing about it
[56:05] that he's talking to somebody
[56:08] maybe you've been around it a little bit
[56:10] a while maybe you've seen some people
[56:11] run and you've seen them shout and
[56:13] you've seen them amen but you can sit
[56:15] right there you can go to the camp
[56:16] meeting you can even get get a little
[56:18] inspired and you can run and you can
[56:20] shout but you know what you can still
[56:22] sit right there and all of that and not
[56:24] know anything about the Holy Ghost and
[56:27] it's time that we look inward in itself
[56:28] and start to ask ourselves the question
[56:30] do we even know anything that we're
[56:32] talking about do I need don't know
[56:34] anything about the Holy Ghost can I
[56:36] produce anything that's in the book of
[56:39] Acts can I point to anything oh God
[56:41] where are you at in my life I realize
[56:43] God I need you I need that power to
[56:46] become a reality I realize that I'm
[56:48] lacking I don't have that power to
[56:50] overcome out there because when I go out
[56:52] there with my friends when I get on the
[56:54] internet every time I see myself doing
[56:56] things that a Son of God that was filled
[56:58] with the Holy Ghost would never do and
[57:00] now I realize oh God I don't know
[57:02] anything about the Holy Ghost well that
[57:04] doesn't make you a Son of God or not a
[57:06] son of God if you were a sign on you
[57:08] always were a son and if you're a Son of
[57:10] God you don't have to have the Holy
[57:12] Ghost
[57:15] that doesn't make you a son
[57:19] what are you talking about brother
[57:20] Matthew this sounds kind of fanatical
[57:22] well I'm so glad I'm standing upon the
[57:24] words of a Vindicated prophet
[57:28] who looks out and says you who don't
[57:31] have the Holy Ghost
[57:33] you don't know nothing about it
[57:36] but something inside of you
[57:39] who wants it
[57:41] that's
[57:42] eternal life
[57:43] and you are heir
[57:47] Hallelujah listen to The Prophet's word
[57:50] if there is something
[57:52] in your heart that wants it he said that
[57:56] is
[57:57] eternal life and in your condition
[58:00] no Holy Ghost don't know nothing about
[58:03] it but in your condition if there's
[58:06] something inside you that wants it he
[58:09] said that is eternal life and you are
[58:12] Heir then if you're Heir that means
[58:15] you're a son that means you're a
[58:16] daughter and now listen to what he tells
[58:18] the believer to do you look at that old
[58:21] devil in the face and you say you Robert
[58:26] how can I do that brother random I don't
[58:29] have the Holy Ghost
[58:31] I don't have I I don't know nothing
[58:33] about it
[58:34] it's not your power
[58:37] you ain't keeping yourself
[58:40] but there's a God Of Heaven who's
[58:43] looking down at you say just check me
[58:45] out my word oh heaven will back you up
[58:48] just look at that old devil say devil
[58:50] you're the robber you've made me do this
[58:52] and you made me do that I'm a Son of God
[58:54] I renounce you Old Devil you've taken my
[58:57] health I'm taking it back in the name of
[59:00] God and you watch he said something's
[59:02] bound to happen watch the Holy Ghost
[59:04] pour out upon you oh Hallelujah he's the
[59:07] same yesterday today and forever and
[59:09] while Peter yet speak these words the
[59:12] Holy Ghost fell upon them that were
[59:14] listening to it he's the same God he's
[59:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[59:18] there is a power that's in the house of
[59:20] God tonight to convert your soul
[59:24] kept by a power
[59:31] we know there's only two powers
[59:35] you have the power of God
[59:40] or the power of Satan
[59:45] we see the powers of Satan
[59:48] it's all around us
[59:51] I don't recommend it but just read the
[59:53] news
[59:55] there you go
[59:59] same news different people
[1:00:02] corrupt
[1:00:03] politics
[1:00:05] corrupt policy
[1:00:08] insanity and Mankind domestic Insanity
[1:00:12] uh that there's just becoming more and
[1:00:16] more murders more and more insanity
[1:00:19] just as Paul would say for we wrestle
[1:00:22] not in Ephesians 6 12 he would say for
[1:00:25] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:00:28] but against principalities against
[1:00:30] powers and against rulers of the
[1:00:33] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:00:36] wickedness in high places
[1:00:40] two powers
[1:00:42] so if it ain't the power of God then
[1:00:44] what power is it
[1:00:46] it's time we grow up
[1:00:48] young people it's time we mature
[1:00:50] it's time we quit playing around and
[1:00:52] think we can keep the same old friends
[1:00:53] from high school and the same old
[1:00:55] friends from our school and we can go
[1:00:56] over their house and we can rub
[1:00:58] shoulders and and we can kind of be like
[1:01:00] them and and we can kind of have fun
[1:01:02] like them no you can't
[1:01:04] no you can't
[1:01:07] God didn't God when he called Abraham
[1:01:10] and called him out and separated a
[1:01:13] people unto himself
[1:01:15] that's not just some neat little story
[1:01:18] come on there's something about it when
[1:01:20] I when I when I when I see I believe
[1:01:22] they call him an orthodox Jew when I see
[1:01:24] one of the Jews that that are still
[1:01:25] believing the same law and they're
[1:01:27] walking around and they got the curls
[1:01:29] and they got their hat and they got the
[1:01:30] clothes I don't know about you but I it
[1:01:31] means something to me
[1:01:33] I feel like they're my brother
[1:01:35] when I when I see them holding to
[1:01:38] something
[1:01:39] because why it it it speaks in my heart
[1:01:42] to a people that's been called out and
[1:01:44] they've been separated
[1:01:46] we're different we dress different we
[1:01:50] talk different we hang out with
[1:01:51] different people
[1:01:55] we're different
[1:01:56] and if we're blending in it's time the
[1:01:58] blending stops
[1:02:01] that's a Nickelodeon spirit
[1:02:03] blending and mixing and talking to boys
[1:02:06] and girls that don't believe them that's
[1:02:09] nonsense
[1:02:12] we need the Holy Ghost we need the power
[1:02:14] that has been given to the age to take
[1:02:17] over our life and to keep us to bring us
[1:02:20] into what he has spoken of you that's
[1:02:23] what we want to have a little Fellowship
[1:02:24] on we're talking about writing the
[1:02:25] Revelation we're writing on the
[1:02:27] Revelation the word that is common has
[1:02:29] been opened up to the believer it's the
[1:02:32] very power that has taken uh taken taken
[1:02:35] you hostage if you can if you as you
[1:02:37] surrender to that word you say oh God I
[1:02:39] know in myself I cannot do it but if I
[1:02:42] just subject myself to your word if I
[1:02:45] just subject myself to your
[1:02:47] righteousness if I just give up my ideas
[1:02:49] in the way that I think things should go
[1:02:51] and I just surrender to this word this
[1:02:54] word will pack you into the fullness of
[1:02:57] the revelation
[1:02:59] why because it's a power
[1:03:02] we wrestle not
[1:03:06] with flesh and blood only but
[1:03:08] principalities and darkness
[1:03:11] I love the message Shalom that that
[1:03:13] brother Brandon would preach I I believe
[1:03:15] is 64. he preaches that I think January
[1:03:18] 12th and also the 16th I believe in 64.
[1:03:21] and
[1:03:22] he he takes Isaiah 60. and he starts to
[1:03:26] use you know arise and shine thy light
[1:03:28] has come
[1:03:30] but in verse 2 he says in in Gross
[1:03:33] darkness is upon the people
[1:03:36] grow gross darkness is upon the people
[1:03:40] there's there's a darkness that is
[1:03:42] pressing
[1:03:44] into the people there is a power that is
[1:03:48] pressing into the people
[1:03:51] come on that's what we're seeing
[1:03:54] I I I I just I I every once in a while I
[1:03:58] look at the news
[1:04:00] and you notice that the offenses and the
[1:04:03] crimes that are committed not only are
[1:04:05] they becoming more of them but the age
[1:04:08] keeps getting lower and lower
[1:04:11] and and I was I was amazed uh I think it
[1:04:14] was last month I was I went and looked
[1:04:17] at the news and there was an
[1:04:18] eight-year-old boy
[1:04:19] who it would shot his mom because she
[1:04:22] didn't buy him a video game
[1:04:26] and I thought oh God
[1:04:28] an eight-year-old how can an
[1:04:30] eight-year-old come to to a place
[1:04:33] to wear a a demonic uh spirit can so
[1:04:37] press himself into him
[1:04:42] and I thought that was you know I didn't
[1:04:45] think we could get any lower
[1:04:47] I I didn't think it could get any worse
[1:04:49] and then you you look at the news and
[1:04:51] find out a six-year-old
[1:04:54] brought a gun to school and shot their
[1:04:56] teacher
[1:04:57] a six-year-old
[1:05:02] that's in the negative
[1:05:05] what what is it there's a power
[1:05:10] look friends what's making them do it
[1:05:13] what's making them act that way
[1:05:15] what's making them do those things
[1:05:17] it's a power
[1:05:20] that is pressing into them
[1:05:23] and taking control of their lives
[1:05:28] six years old
[1:05:32] well that's in the negative
[1:05:36] and all of a sudden I start to think
[1:05:38] well
[1:05:39] if the devil can do that
[1:05:41] is there any six-year-olds in here
[1:05:43] raise your hand any six-year-olds
[1:05:45] seven-year-old oh they're I'm preaching
[1:05:48] to y'all back there
[1:05:50] hey you six and seven year olds back
[1:05:53] there in Sunday school I want to tell
[1:05:55] you you can be filled with the Holy
[1:05:57] Ghost
[1:05:58] you can turn this world upside down it's
[1:06:02] six-year-olds and seven-year-olds are
[1:06:04] packing guns to school then why not our
[1:06:06] six and seven year olds packing Bibles
[1:06:08] oh mama I got kicked out of school again
[1:06:10] for what I propped my sword praise the
[1:06:13] Living God go ahead and convert somebody
[1:06:15] young people if the devil can take
[1:06:18] control of six-year-olds and
[1:06:20] seven-year-olds and their girls then my
[1:06:22] God has such a power to combat that and
[1:06:26] take our six-year-olds take our seven
[1:06:28] years and fill them with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:32] maybe I've lost my mind but I believe it
[1:06:36] I believe it
[1:06:39] I'm looking for it I got an expectation
[1:06:42] I don't know maybe a five-year-old
[1:06:43] starts speaking in tongues in our church
[1:06:46] maybe a six-year-old will prophesy
[1:06:51] is anything too hard for God
[1:06:54] where are you at church
[1:06:56] there they are I'm looking for these
[1:06:58] young ones right here get a good look at
[1:07:00] these young kids walking in I'm
[1:07:01] believing for them to be filled with the
[1:07:04] power of God
[1:07:07] I'm looking for it Saints we gotta go in
[1:07:10] a rapture
[1:07:12] we always wonder
[1:07:14] how is that going to happen we keep
[1:07:16] having babies we be keep having kids
[1:07:18] well I'm just starting to think I got a
[1:07:20] god
[1:07:22] matter of fact it comes to me now
[1:07:23] Hallelujah if John
[1:07:26] could be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] in his mama's womb then I believe the
[1:07:31] pride of Jesus Christ go on and keep
[1:07:33] planting your potatoes keep having
[1:07:35] children and when that sweet comes maybe
[1:07:38] that baby had been laying in their dead
[1:07:40] you haven't felt it in three or four
[1:07:42] months and I'll say whoa what is that
[1:07:44] what is it it's the coming of the Lord
[1:07:47] the Holy Ghost is not only swept into
[1:07:49] your womb but it's swept into your whole
[1:07:51] family it's going to bring up Pride into
[1:07:53] a body change into a Rapture there is a
[1:07:56] power that has been poured out upon the
[1:07:58] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:00] oh I'm looking for at church
[1:08:03] call me crazy call me insane but I'm
[1:08:06] looking for my young ones four years old
[1:08:09] five years old where are you at
[1:08:11] I'm looking for the power of God to take
[1:08:14] control of your life
[1:08:17] yeah well what about us parents then
[1:08:23] I need the power of God taking control
[1:08:25] of my own life
[1:08:29] not just on Sunday not just on Wednesday
[1:08:34] every moment
[1:08:37] of every day
[1:08:39] let me surrender myself
[1:08:43] to that power
[1:08:45] because it's here
[1:08:52] Mark 13 20 would say and accept that the
[1:08:55] Lord had shortened those days
[1:08:58] no flesh should be saved
[1:09:02] but for the elect's sake
[1:09:05] whom he hath chosen
[1:09:07] he hath shortened the days
[1:09:10] this another layer of this opened up
[1:09:13] I always read that and I realized
[1:09:16] oh
[1:09:18] no flesh
[1:09:21] no flesh could be saved
[1:09:24] don't you see what Satan's coming for
[1:09:27] he's coming for the children
[1:09:33] 12 year old wasn't young enough
[1:09:35] 11 wasn't young enough
[1:09:38] 10 wasn't young enough nine eight seven
[1:09:43] six
[1:09:44] sounds like a countdown
[1:09:46] yeah
[1:09:48] we're in a countdown
[1:09:51] no flesh is going to be saved
[1:09:55] there is one
[1:09:57] place of safety
[1:10:00] that is the power
[1:10:03] that has been released to the Bride of
[1:10:05] Jesus Christ in the evening time
[1:10:10] under the revelation
[1:10:18] praise the Lord
[1:10:24] there's a revelation that's been
[1:10:25] released
[1:10:27] something to take you and to pack you to
[1:10:29] keep you
[1:10:30] and outside of that
[1:10:33] outside of that
[1:10:36] I I don't know any other place of safety
[1:10:40] I don't know how God will do it I I mean
[1:10:43] I know there's I know there's foolish
[1:10:45] virgin
[1:10:45] and I know there's going to be a white
[1:10:48] Throne judgment and and I know I don't
[1:10:51] understand it because
[1:10:52] some will be able who never had eternal
[1:10:56] life
[1:10:57] will be able to enter in
[1:11:00] you understand me only the bride only
[1:11:03] those that were a part of him
[1:11:05] always were you've always had eternal
[1:11:07] life because you're a son or daughter of
[1:11:10] him
[1:11:12] so so you you've always had it but God
[1:11:15] in his Sovereign Grace and his Mercy yes
[1:11:17] on that day somebody who was maybe good
[1:11:19] to the bride or they walked into light
[1:11:21] that they had and on that day God will
[1:11:24] see fit
[1:11:25] to to Pardon them
[1:11:27] but I tell you I I I don't know I can't
[1:11:31] see how anybody if you understand where
[1:11:33] I'm going with this
[1:11:35] well I'll just speak on myself there's
[1:11:37] no way I could make it on that on white
[1:11:39] throne no way
[1:11:41] no I'm sorry no
[1:11:44] and no man
[1:11:47] no man or woman
[1:11:48] can make it on their works
[1:11:52] impossible
[1:11:56] so they went a message
[1:11:58] when the Capstone calls comes crying
[1:12:00] Grace Grace
[1:12:04] and he's bringing a love letter to the
[1:12:06] church
[1:12:09] it's like not pardoned you
[1:12:11] this is my pardon
[1:12:14] this is the fullness of redemption
[1:12:17] this is the plan I've had in my mind all
[1:12:20] down Through the Ages
[1:12:22] he that huffing ear let him hear what
[1:12:24] the spirit is saying to the church
[1:12:27] this is what I've been doing all Along
[1:12:29] come out of her my people be not a
[1:12:32] partaker of her plagues you got to come
[1:12:35] out and come into the message this is
[1:12:37] the only place of safety and it's in the
[1:12:39] message where there's a power
[1:12:42] to take you into
[1:12:45] not leave you here for a tribulation
[1:12:49] ain't no guarantees there is what we're
[1:12:51] talking about we're gonna somehow find a
[1:12:53] way to close
[1:12:55] but it's getting so evil
[1:12:59] remember remember Sodom
[1:13:01] I can't remember what to start off with
[1:13:02] Abraham's like well
[1:13:05] you know please don't destroy him if so
[1:13:07] many could be saved no
[1:13:10] I ain't that many righteous there well a
[1:13:11] hundred no 50
[1:13:14] no 10.
[1:13:16] nope
[1:13:17] you see that's the condition we're
[1:13:19] living in
[1:13:20] no flesh
[1:13:22] will be saved
[1:13:23] the prophet of God says this and the
[1:13:25] voice of the sign
[1:13:27] God will build his church upon the
[1:13:29] foundation of Jesus Christ
[1:13:32] and that's the Bible
[1:13:33] outside of that all other grounds are
[1:13:35] sinking Sands
[1:13:37] God doesn't change
[1:13:39] his nature doesn't change he made women
[1:13:43] different from men and men different
[1:13:44] from women he dressed them different and
[1:13:46] wants them to stay that way see when
[1:13:49] women wants to look like men and men
[1:13:50] wants to look like women oh my such a
[1:13:53] perversion and the whole thing looked
[1:13:55] like it's got a grip on the people and
[1:13:58] you can't change it
[1:14:01] looks like a great monster
[1:14:05] a great Blackness if you understand what
[1:14:08] I'm speaking of in the spirit a monster
[1:14:12] has got them grabbed and they can't get
[1:14:16] away from it
[1:14:18] too much Hollywood too much television
[1:14:21] too much other nonsense everything we
[1:14:25] got is polluted no wonder
[1:14:28] if the work isn't cut short for the
[1:14:31] elect's sake there will be no flesh
[1:14:34] saved
[1:14:36] a monster has grabbed them
[1:14:40] now you start to understand
[1:14:43] the things you're reading in the news
[1:14:46] and and why six-year-olds and
[1:14:48] seven-year-olds can do the things that
[1:14:50] they're doing because they've indicated
[1:14:52] Prophet I stood on the earth and said a
[1:14:55] monster
[1:14:57] has actually grabbed them there's too
[1:15:00] much Hollywood too much TV too much
[1:15:03] nonsense oh look look it's the invasion
[1:15:05] of America what has happened Satan has
[1:15:08] taken over the minds and the lives of
[1:15:11] people and they have been given over to
[1:15:14] a reprobate mind they have been totally
[1:15:16] uh uh uh
[1:15:18] possessed by spirits
[1:15:21] a monsters grab them
[1:15:24] now if anything that should be sobering
[1:15:26] to every single one of us to know when
[1:15:28] we go out into the world when we go out
[1:15:31] into the workplace when we go to the
[1:15:33] restaurants wherever you go know that
[1:15:35] people have been abducted by a monster
[1:15:38] and he's making them dressed that way
[1:15:41] act that way say the things that they're
[1:15:43] doing it's spiritual wickedness in high
[1:15:46] places that has totally grabbed their
[1:15:48] lives and is making them do the things
[1:15:50] that they're doing
[1:15:55] we say brother Matthew that's just the
[1:15:56] evil people well
[1:15:58] John 6 28 said then said they unto him
[1:16:01] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:16:03] works of God Jesus said unto them this
[1:16:05] is the work of God
[1:16:08] that ye believe on him whom he hath sent
[1:16:14] what is the church world done
[1:16:17] they've rejected the messenger
[1:16:19] they've rejected the word they have
[1:16:22] rejected Revelations 10 7. they first uh
[1:16:26] let's read Titus 1 16 quickly
[1:16:31] foreign
[1:16:35] they profess that they know God
[1:16:38] but in Works they deny him
[1:16:43] being abominable and disobedient and
[1:16:46] unto every good work reprobate
[1:16:50] David would say this in Psalms 106 39 he
[1:16:53] say thus were they defiled with their
[1:16:55] own works and went a whoring with their
[1:16:57] own inventions
[1:16:59] second Timothy 3 5 moving quickly
[1:17:02] towards a close having a form of
[1:17:04] godliness but denying
[1:17:08] the power
[1:17:10] thereof
[1:17:11] from such turn away
[1:17:16] now I've just taken some time to labor
[1:17:18] upon that because we want to come back
[1:17:19] to what we were we were ministering in
[1:17:21] the beginning
[1:17:23] we see that power
[1:17:26] we see the power of wickedness we see
[1:17:28] the power of Darkness but there is
[1:17:31] another Power
[1:17:33] John 1 12.
[1:17:37] but as many as received him
[1:17:40] glory to God
[1:17:43] God has a provided way
[1:17:45] how can we work the works of God believe
[1:17:47] on him who is sent
[1:17:50] and as many as received him as many as
[1:17:52] received Christ the word
[1:17:54] to them gave he power to become the sons
[1:17:58] of God
[1:17:59] even to them that believe on his name
[1:18:05] I want to say there is a power to make
[1:18:07] you what you are
[1:18:09] you are a son of God you are a daughter
[1:18:12] of God
[1:18:13] you didn't become a son or a daughter of
[1:18:16] God by the new birth
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:19] you always were a son or daughter of God
[1:18:22] therefore you could be reborn
[1:18:25] so there has to be a power
[1:18:29] to come upon your life
[1:18:31] to transform you into what God has
[1:18:34] spoken of you
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:38] look at Samson
[1:18:40] Samson was just a little scrawny boy
[1:18:45] but he was chosen to be a deliverer he
[1:18:48] was chosen to be a judge
[1:18:52] right
[1:18:53] God had given him a purpose God had
[1:18:55] given him a calling
[1:18:58] but but Samson didn't have strength
[1:19:03] Samson didn't have ability
[1:19:06] but what he had is that he was elected
[1:19:11] he was born
[1:19:13] to manifest
[1:19:15] the word of God as a judge for Israel
[1:19:18] that when they would get themselves in
[1:19:21] trouble
[1:19:22] and the enemy would come against him
[1:19:24] that God would send a power
[1:19:27] upon Samson and then when that power
[1:19:30] Came Upon Samson then you really saw
[1:19:34] what Samson was
[1:19:36] then he could really perform the work of
[1:19:39] the Lord
[1:19:40] because there was a power to make him
[1:19:43] what he was
[1:19:46] you look at the Hebrew children look
[1:19:47] they they said hey we're not going to
[1:19:49] bend we're not going to bow
[1:19:51] but we serve a god
[1:19:55] that's able to deliver us
[1:19:58] we serve a God that has the power
[1:20:01] see the Hebrew children had a revelation
[1:20:06] my God's A Healer
[1:20:09] he's going to heal me and even if he
[1:20:11] don't
[1:20:13] I will I will
[1:20:15] spend every waking moment professing my
[1:20:18] God Is A Healer
[1:20:23] O King even if you throw me into the
[1:20:26] fiery furnace am I God doesn't deliver
[1:20:28] me he's a deliverer
[1:20:30] he's a god of power he's a god of love
[1:20:33] he's a god of compassion he's a long
[1:20:36] suffering he's a god of forgiveness he
[1:20:38] is a god of kindness why because it's a
[1:20:40] revelation I'm not basing life
[1:20:43] experiences upon who God is I'm basing
[1:20:47] it upon the revelation of what he has
[1:20:49] revealed to me in my soul in Heaven and
[1:20:52] Earth will pass away but this word this
[1:20:55] Revelation that I'm riding on will never
[1:20:57] pass away
[1:21:00] and that power showed up and did the job
[1:21:05] there was a fourth man in the fire
[1:21:07] there was another Power
[1:21:10] that where even the fire couldn't touch
[1:21:12] him
[1:21:14] don't you realize that you have access
[1:21:16] don't you realize that that same power
[1:21:18] is over your life
[1:21:20] that same power is here to make you an
[1:21:23] overcomer that same power is here to
[1:21:25] deliver you you don't have to keep
[1:21:27] contending with those same habits you
[1:21:29] don't have to continue going through all
[1:21:31] of those things
[1:21:42] I don't want to keep you too long but
[1:21:45] the power of God
[1:21:48] there's a power of God
[1:21:51] to make you
[1:21:52] something in your heart believes it if
[1:21:55] something in you amen is the word
[1:21:58] there's a power of God that's keeping
[1:22:00] you to bring you into the manifestation
[1:22:01] of it
[1:22:03] the God God sent Moses down to the
[1:22:05] children of Israel brought him out of
[1:22:06] Egypt two million of them right 2
[1:22:09] million strong
[1:22:10] come out into the Wilderness look they
[1:22:13] all were delivered out of Egypt they all
[1:22:15] crossed the Red Sea
[1:22:17] they all saw the pillar of Fire by night
[1:22:19] in the cloud by day
[1:22:21] they all they all drank from the water
[1:22:24] the bitter water that was turned
[1:22:26] they all drank from The Rock they all
[1:22:29] ate Manna in the wilderness
[1:22:33] but how many crossed over into the
[1:22:36] Promised Land
[1:22:38] there was only two because out of the 2
[1:22:41] million two of them were riding on a
[1:22:44] revelation
[1:22:45] see when the children at Cadence barnia
[1:22:48] when they had crossed over into the
[1:22:50] promised land ten spies came by back and
[1:22:53] testified what man could do oh
[1:22:57] 10 spies came back and said we can't do
[1:23:00] it
[1:23:01] see they were looking at what man could
[1:23:03] do because they didn't have the
[1:23:05] revelation
[1:23:07] they weren't elected
[1:23:09] but there was two that come back they
[1:23:12] weren't looking at what man could do
[1:23:14] they were looking at what God could do
[1:23:16] through man they were looking at
[1:23:19] abilities they were looking at the
[1:23:20] promise and saying oh the same God that
[1:23:22] brought us out of Egypt the same God
[1:23:24] that brought us into the Wilderness the
[1:23:26] same God that fed ourselves he's the
[1:23:28] same God the same power that will
[1:23:31] deliver us out of the hands of the enemy
[1:23:38] I like how Paul says in Galatians 2
[1:23:42] he says I went up by Revelation
[1:23:45] Galatians 2 verse 2.
[1:23:54] would just be about 10 more minutes
[1:23:55] we'll move straight into communion
[1:23:59] he says
[1:24:01] and I went up by Revelation and
[1:24:04] communicated unto them that the gospel
[1:24:06] which I preached among the Gentiles but
[1:24:08] privately to them which were a
[1:24:09] reputation unless by any means I should
[1:24:11] run and had to run in vain I just
[1:24:13] something spoke to my heart there how it
[1:24:15] says that Paul went up by revelation
[1:24:18] see when something is revealed to you
[1:24:21] it's something that you know
[1:24:25] he says I went up by Revelation Paul
[1:24:28] wasn't pre-adventuring Paul wasn't
[1:24:30] wondering Paul wasn't uh uh uh uh uh
[1:24:33] thinking well this might work out Paul
[1:24:36] wasn't going up by man's idea he wasn't
[1:24:38] going up there and I hope it'll work out
[1:24:40] he wasn't going up by some emotion or
[1:24:43] some agenda or some point of view or
[1:24:45] some conclusion but Paul was going up by
[1:24:49] a revelation and it's the Revelation
[1:24:51] that carries you
[1:24:55] see just just as Paul right Paul was
[1:24:58] there on the boat and the angel of the
[1:25:00] Lord was with him and said hey Paul look
[1:25:01] you must go appear before Caesar
[1:25:05] now Paul had that revelation
[1:25:08] you must go up here before Caesar and
[1:25:11] you're not going to lose any lives on
[1:25:12] this boat now that it was a revelation
[1:25:14] to Paul so Paul could stand there and
[1:25:17] declare to the men on that boat say hey
[1:25:19] the angel of the Lord appeared to me
[1:25:21] last night and he said that look there's
[1:25:23] not going to be any loss of life but I
[1:25:26] must appear before Caesar so what does
[1:25:28] that mean no matter what Paul went
[1:25:30] through
[1:25:32] there wasn't no shipwreck there wasn't
[1:25:35] no snake biting there wasn't no
[1:25:38] government that could stop Paul from
[1:25:40] going to where God said he was going and
[1:25:43] I want to say the same thing for the
[1:25:44] Bride of Jesus Christ there ain't no
[1:25:46] shipwreck there ain't no car wreck there
[1:25:49] ain't no mistakes there ain't no unpaid
[1:25:51] bills there ain't no lost job there
[1:25:54] ain't no breakup there ain't no family
[1:25:56] situation there ain't no health issues
[1:25:58] there is nothing that is going to stop
[1:26:01] you from going into the presence of God
[1:26:03] because there's a power that is over
[1:26:05] your life that is going to pack you into
[1:26:07] the word that he spoke over your life
[1:26:11] what shall separate us
[1:26:13] from the love of God what is it the love
[1:26:15] of God the Capstone that's the enforcer
[1:26:18] it's the love of God over your life
[1:26:21] that's producing the message of the hour
[1:26:26] nothing can stop you Church
[1:26:29] and when it's revealed to you
[1:26:31] just to read a quick the prophet of God
[1:26:34] just a short snippet he says and then he
[1:26:37] says when you see it it's revealed to
[1:26:38] you and you know where you're going
[1:26:41] then nothing
[1:26:43] is going to stop you
[1:26:47] Glory
[1:26:50] so then when he says you're the Bride of
[1:26:52] Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] you're sinless you're virtuous
[1:26:58] come on
[1:27:00] I know I say it a lot because I believe
[1:27:02] it
[1:27:03] it's it's it's it's been revealed
[1:27:06] we've received a revelation of Who We
[1:27:09] Are
[1:27:10] because Christ has revealed who he is
[1:27:13] and the revealing of the bridegroom
[1:27:16] it's a revealing of who we are because
[1:27:19] we're part of him
[1:27:21] then all of the things that he spoke in
[1:27:23] concerning you he has released a power
[1:27:27] over your life to bring you into the
[1:27:30] Fulfillment of that
[1:27:39] praise the Lord
[1:27:46] amen we'll just ask the brothers to come
[1:27:48] and
[1:27:49] start getting ready that's going to
[1:27:50] force my hand
[1:27:56] it's revealed to you and you know where
[1:27:59] you're going
[1:28:00] then nothing is going to stop you
[1:28:03] Abraham where are you going
[1:28:06] I don't know but I'm going on a promise
[1:28:08] he said it I believe it that settles it
[1:28:13] and Romans 4 19 says and being not weak
[1:28:16] in faith he considered not his own body
[1:28:18] now dead
[1:28:19] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:28:21] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[1:28:24] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:28:25] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[1:28:28] giving glory to God and being fully
[1:28:31] persuaded
[1:28:33] that what he had promised
[1:28:35] he was also able
[1:28:38] to perform you believe that let's just
[1:28:40] stand
[1:28:47] be therefore perfect
[1:28:50] there's a power producing perfection in
[1:28:53] you
[1:28:54] there is something carrying you
[1:28:58] the Capstone himself has come to the
[1:29:01] brine
[1:29:01] the revelation of who he is
[1:29:04] the love of God is called
[1:29:07] why don't you come
[1:29:09] why don't you heed the call why don't
[1:29:10] you be a part of this amen let's just
[1:29:12] turn in our Bibles to First Corinthians
[1:29:15] chapter 11.
[1:29:30] we'll read verse 23-34
[1:29:38] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:29:40] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:29:42] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:29:44] was betrayed to bread and when he had
[1:29:47] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:29:48] it this is my body which is broken for
[1:29:51] you
[1:29:52] this due in remembrance of me
[1:29:54] and after the same manner also he took
[1:29:56] the cup
[1:29:57] and when he hits up saying this is
[1:30:00] the cup
[1:30:01] in the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:30:04] you as often as you drink it in
[1:30:07] remembrance of me for as oft as you eat
[1:30:10] the spread and drink this cup you do
[1:30:11] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:30:13] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:30:15] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:30:17] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:30:19] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:30:21] examine himself
[1:30:23] and let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:30:26] of that cup
[1:30:28] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:30:29] unworthily
[1:30:31] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:30:33] not Discerning the Lord's body
[1:30:36] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:30:39] among you
[1:30:40] and many sleep for if we judge ourselves
[1:30:43] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:30:45] judged we are chasten of the Lord
[1:30:47] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:30:49] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:30:51] come together to eat Terry one for
[1:30:52] another
[1:30:53] and if any man hunger
[1:30:55] let him eat at home
[1:30:57] that ye come not together
[1:30:59] unto condemnation and the rest
[1:31:02] will I set an order when I come
[1:31:13] Lord Jesus we just take this bread
[1:31:16] that represents your body that was
[1:31:18] broken for us
[1:31:20] and you said Lord let us examine
[1:31:22] ourselves
[1:31:25] Lord we don't
[1:31:27] want to take it unworthily
[1:31:29] but we know that there's been a price
[1:31:31] paid
[1:31:32] that if we would identify with the
[1:31:34] sacrifice
[1:31:36] and we confess our sins knowing that
[1:31:38] you're just and faithful to forgive us
[1:31:40] Lord then then we can take eat of this
[1:31:42] bread
[1:31:45] we can remember your death
[1:31:47] your Resurrection your body that was
[1:31:50] broken for us Lord
[1:31:52] we take this wine
[1:31:55] father represents your blood that was
[1:31:57] shed for us
[1:32:00] Lord without that blood
[1:32:03] there would be no way for us to be able
[1:32:05] to come before you
[1:32:08] but it's that blood that we identify in
[1:32:10] the life that's in the blood Lord
[1:32:12] and how this represents that great
[1:32:14] sacrifice that you laid down your life
[1:32:15] for us that we could be forgiven
[1:32:18] so father we've taken the bread
[1:32:20] we take this cup Lord
[1:32:23] we pray your blessings upon and upon the
[1:32:25] people
[1:32:26] father as we tarry one for another may
[1:32:28] we examine ourselves
[1:32:31] Lord It's Too Late of an hour to be
[1:32:32] playing Church
[1:32:35] Lord if there's things we need to make
[1:32:36] right let's make them right
[1:32:40] this is a church
[1:32:42] that has been given the greatest
[1:32:43] privilege
[1:32:45] that anyone has ever known
[1:32:48] to live under the revealed word of the
[1:32:50] hour
[1:32:51] where any day we can be caught away to
[1:32:54] meet you in the air
[1:32:55] so Lord we do this with all of our heart
[1:32:57] now we ask the blessings upon the Bread
[1:32:59] and Wine in Jesus Christ's name we pray
