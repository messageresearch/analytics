[34:27] amen amen amen get you all tonight in
[34:31] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ while
[34:34] we are staring at us just into the Book
[34:35] of Genesis
[34:37] chapter 18.
[34:39] we have a few portions of scripture
[34:41] we're going to read tonight very short
[34:43] verses Genesis Chapter 18 1-3
[34:47] and also lower down 9-15 and then job
[34:49] Chapter 14 verse 14.
[34:53] and then First Corinthians chapter 15.
[34:56] 15 to 51-52 and Philippians chapter 3
[35:00] verses 20 to 21.
[35:04] we'll read Genesis Chapter 18 verses 1
[35:08] to 3.
[35:09] and the Lord appeared unto him in the
[35:12] plains of memory
[35:14] and he sat in the tender In the Heat of
[35:17] the day
[35:18] and he lift up his eyes and looked and
[35:20] lo three men stood by him
[35:23] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[35:26] from the chain door and bowed himself
[35:29] towards the ground
[35:30] and said my Lord if now I have found
[35:34] favor in thy sight
[35:35] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[35:40] servant they will read from verse 9 and
[35:43] they said unto him
[35:46] where is Sarah thy wife
[35:48] and he said behold in the tent
[35:52] and he said I will certainly return unto
[35:55] thee according to the time of life
[35:57] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[36:01] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[36:04] which was behind him
[36:07] now Abram and Sarah were old and
[36:10] well-stricken in age and it ceased to be
[36:12] with Sarah after the manner of woman
[36:16] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[36:19] saying after I am wax old shall I have
[36:22] pleasure with my pleasure my Lord being
[36:25] old also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[36:29] wherefore did Sarah love saying shall I
[36:33] of assurity bear a child which am old
[36:37] is anything too hard for the Lord
[36:40] at the time appointed I will return unto
[36:43] thee according to the time of life and
[36:47] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied
[36:50] saying I laughed not
[36:52] for she was afraid and said nay but thou
[36:56] didst love amen now we turn to Job
[37:00] chapter 14 and verse 14.
[37:09] if a man die
[37:11] shall he live again
[37:14] all the days of my appointed time will I
[37:17] wait
[37:17] till my change come
[37:21] in First Corinthians chapter 15
[37:24] verses 51 and 52.
[37:30] behold I show you a mystery
[37:33] we shall not all sleep
[37:35] but we shall all be changed
[37:38] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[37:41] at the Lost Trump for the trumpet shall
[37:45] sound and the dead shall be raised
[37:47] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[37:51] the last scripture Philippians chapter 3
[37:54] verses 20 to 21
[37:57] .
[38:00] for our conversation is in heaven
[38:03] from winds also we look for the Savior
[38:06] the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:09] who shall change our vile body
[38:12] that it may be fashion like unto his
[38:15] glorious body
[38:16] according to the working whereby he is
[38:20] able even to subdue all things unto
[38:23] himself
[38:25] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[38:26] reading of his word you may be seated
[38:29] amen
[38:30] so tonight as we are gathered for
[38:32] Fellowship around the word of the Lord I
[38:35] would like to speak on the story
[38:36] inspiration The Mystery of the change
[38:41] amen
[38:44] now as we read the Bible we find that
[38:46] the Bible is silent about the change
[38:50] of Abram and Sarah's body
[38:53] about them being young again
[38:56] and no one but Abram and Sarah
[38:59] was a way of the change
[39:03] and they were the ones who met
[39:05] Melchizedek
[39:07] the Bible does not outrightly say their
[39:10] bodies were changed
[39:13] and you know we are living in a similar
[39:15] situation today
[39:16] we had a visitation from God
[39:19] and he appeared in the form of human
[39:22] flesh and use the body of William
[39:25] Branham
[39:26] and you know Sodom was just getting more
[39:28] sinful the world was getting darker in
[39:31] that time it was on the verge of
[39:33] judgment
[39:34] but at the same time they were two
[39:37] people
[39:38] they were looking for a change
[39:40] to meet the promised son
[39:43] so these two things are happening at the
[39:45] same time and yeah the end time we find
[39:47] the same situation the world is getting
[39:50] darker and darker more sinful but at the
[39:54] same time upon the Earth there's a class
[39:57] of people who have met Melchizedek
[40:01] there's a people that is going through a
[40:04] change
[40:05] to meet the body amen that the sun the
[40:08] sun
[40:10] so you find these two things are
[40:11] happening at the same time
[40:14] so you're either on the side where
[40:16] there's a change taking place because
[40:18] the Bible says we shall be changed
[40:22] or you can be on the other side as we
[40:24] had this morning on the outside looking
[40:26] in going through the other change
[40:27] getting more sinful and going away Into
[40:31] Darkness the Bible says there'll be
[40:32] gross Darkness amen but at the same time
[40:35] there is light amen rise Shine for thy
[40:38] light is come the glory of the Lord is
[40:41] risen upon thee
[40:43] see so we find it was a mystery
[40:47] this end time visitation
[40:50] by Melchizedek but it took the profit of
[40:54] the seventh seal
[40:57] see
[40:58] it's silent about the the change of
[41:02] Abraham and Sarah
[41:03] but yeah at the end time we had a
[41:05] prophet
[41:06] and he came under the revelation of the
[41:09] seventh seal the silent seal
[41:12] he was the messenger of the unwritten
[41:15] word
[41:16] he was the one that could look read
[41:18] between the lines
[41:21] so it was not written that it happened
[41:24] and if we read the unwritten word it
[41:27] seems like strange I'm saying to you now
[41:29] if we read the unwritten word we can see
[41:33] that both Abram and Sarah
[41:36] they went through a body change
[41:39] so the seventh seal is silent
[41:43] it only says there was silence in heaven
[41:46] for the space of half an hour
[41:49] it says nothing about the body change
[41:53] that the Royal seal of Abram would be
[41:56] visited by Melchizedek
[41:59] God in human flesh
[42:02] before the rapturing of the church
[42:06] so the silence in Heaven Must Be
[42:09] Connected with a change on the Earth
[42:14] because the Bible says there was silence
[42:16] in heaven
[42:17] and Revelation 10 brother Branham says
[42:19] is your seventh seal
[42:22] and it says I saw another Mighty Angel
[42:25] come down from heaven
[42:27] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[42:30] upon his head and his feet as well as a
[42:33] fire
[42:34] the problem is that is your seventh seal
[42:38] but at that time there was silence in
[42:40] heaven
[42:42] amen because while he's in heaven the
[42:44] Angels they worship day and night saying
[42:47] holy holy holy unto the Lord
[42:51] holy holy holy unto the Lord but he's no
[42:55] longer there
[42:56] there is nothing to worship
[42:58] so there's silence in heaven so the
[43:01] activity is taking place on Earth
[43:05] he's now getting a bride together
[43:06] because thessalonia says the Lord
[43:09] himself
[43:10] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[43:13] with the voice of the Archangel and a
[43:16] trump of God
[43:18] the Lord himself
[43:21] and brother Branham says that shout is
[43:23] the living bread of life bringing forth
[43:26] the bride
[43:28] so she's manifested under the shout
[43:30] the living bread of life brings forth
[43:33] the bride
[43:34] and the voice is the voice of the
[43:37] resurrection and the trumpet gathers
[43:39] everything together and that the Lord
[43:42] does all three as he descends
[43:45] now in the message who is this melchized
[43:48] brother Branham refers to this angel
[43:53] now look at them down there in Sodom
[43:56] and there is their Messengers
[44:00] down there speaking to them
[44:02] that's Billy Graham and Oral Roberts
[44:05] but then where is that Royal Seed of
[44:08] Abraham
[44:11] because this message is giving a call
[44:13] to the Royal seed of Abram
[44:16] there's no other Mission upon the Earth
[44:18] but this message
[44:20] that is now being manifested to the
[44:22] Royal seed of Abram
[44:25] amen Gathering them together
[44:27] for the changing of the body to meet the
[44:30] promised son
[44:32] see
[44:33] where is their sign
[44:35] that he said as it was in the days of
[44:39] Sodom
[44:40] that God came down and was manifested in
[44:45] human flesh
[44:47] brother and sister we received a
[44:49] visitation from heaven
[44:52] we have been influenced by a heavenly
[44:56] visitation
[44:58] that's why we are what we are we are not
[45:01] like the world it's because of that one
[45:04] visitation from God veiled in human
[45:07] flesh
[45:09] and he delivered a message
[45:11] Amen to prepare Bride for rapturing
[45:15] faith
[45:17] that's the next thing in order I don't
[45:18] want to go ahead of the message but that
[45:20] thing is that's the next thing in order
[45:23] is the rapturing of the church we're not
[45:26] looking for great revivals or anything
[45:28] happening with somebody coming with a
[45:30] special message or whatever the next or
[45:33] in order is the rapture
[45:35] the changing of the body as we heard
[45:38] this morning
[45:39] he says here
[45:42] and he told Sarah was thinking back in
[45:44] the heart in the tent behind him
[45:48] the last sign before the Gentile world
[45:52] was to be destroyed by fire
[45:56] and the church listen the way the
[45:58] prophet says it and the church has got
[46:02] its lost sign
[46:04] it's happened
[46:06] see before the whole world is going to
[46:09] be destroyed
[46:11] this Gentile Kingdom be destroyed by the
[46:15] fire and the wrath of God do you believe
[46:19] that
[46:20] amen
[46:22] that Melchizedek was flesh
[46:25] represented himself in a human body
[46:29] and then later he was made flesh
[46:33] and now tonight he's the same yesterday
[46:37] today and forever
[46:42] so the one that represented himself in
[46:44] the human body
[46:45] the one that was made flesh is now taken
[46:49] in another flesh appealing to the Royal
[46:51] Seed of Abraham
[46:53] and wherever do you believe it he says
[46:55] who is this Melchizedek then
[46:59] that's the same yesterday today and
[47:03] forever
[47:04] never had no father
[47:06] never had no mother he never had no
[47:09] beginning of days he never have an end
[47:13] of life
[47:14] and he met Abraham and what kind of a
[47:18] sign did he perform
[47:20] then when he was made flesh he said it
[47:23] would repeat again just before the end
[47:27] time
[47:28] amen that's the god that we serve right
[47:32] there in the Book of Genesis you already
[47:34] could see in the future and when he came
[47:37] in the middle of the book as it was in
[47:39] the days of lot so shall be in the days
[47:42] when the son of man shall be revealed
[47:44] what is the son of man the word in human
[47:48] flesh the logo thing on the form in the
[47:51] hiding himself now before behind human
[47:53] flesh to manifest the Lost sign
[47:57] he says do you believe it now the
[48:00] appearing of that word
[48:03] or logos in human flesh
[48:08] was assigned to the Royal seat of Abram
[48:12] of the coming Sun
[48:15] they are now preparing to meet the
[48:18] coming Sun
[48:19] they must first be a body change
[48:23] before they can meet the promised son
[48:27] but before there can be a body change
[48:30] there must first be a spirit change
[48:33] by the appearing of God himself in human
[48:37] flesh
[48:40] speaking the promise
[48:42] like he did to Abram and Sarah you will
[48:46] have that son
[48:48] he didn't elaborate anything further he
[48:50] just said you can have the son
[48:52] he didn't tell him that their body is
[48:53] going to be changed he told him nothing
[48:55] because because everything they required
[48:58] to prove to manifest or to bring forth
[49:00] the promised son it was all in the
[49:03] promise
[49:05] so there will be a Rapture everything
[49:07] that we need for the Rapture is in the
[49:09] promise
[49:10] amen hallelujah
[49:14] so the promise of the coming son must
[49:17] happen in that order
[49:20] that is one principle that brother
[49:21] Branham taught us if he does something
[49:24] in a certain way
[49:26] in a certain situation when that same
[49:29] situation arises he's going to do
[49:32] exactly the same like he did it the
[49:34] first time
[49:36] so there was the appearing of
[49:37] Melchizedek he made the promise of the
[49:40] coming son you will have the son and
[49:43] immediately after that the body changed
[49:45] took place
[49:47] so Melchizedek has already appeared
[49:50] so we are living or we are with a
[49:53] promise that the prophet has left us
[49:56] amen
[49:58] so we find that the change starts when
[50:00] Melchizedek
[50:01] God in human flesh appears to the Royal
[50:06] Seed of Abraham
[50:09] so we find out that this is not just
[50:11] establishing churches
[50:14] but it's absolutely preparing a people
[50:17] for the rapture preparing a people to
[50:20] meet the promised son
[50:22] and that's what the fivefold ministry is
[50:24] all about brother Branham says God
[50:27] conditions the church the people
[50:30] to meet the promised son so every time
[50:33] you come to service you come for a
[50:35] conditioning
[50:37] to prepare you for to meet the promised
[50:40] son there's an expectation of the
[50:42] changing of our body
[50:45] amen but we find that dear brother and
[50:47] sister the question is did it happen in
[50:51] our day
[50:53] I'd like to read a quotation here with
[50:55] brother Branham says let me turn my back
[50:59] you pray
[51:01] the angel that appeared in human flesh
[51:04] had his back turned to the tent
[51:07] where Sarah was
[51:10] now who could speak like this
[51:13] other than the messenger
[51:16] amen
[51:18] and he told Sarah what she was what she
[51:21] did is that right
[51:22] that same Angel was God
[51:28] in other words God appeared
[51:31] you're in the last day
[51:33] the Lord himself
[51:35] he came in our midst
[51:37] to prepare Bride for translation faith
[51:41] he says yeah
[51:43] and and
[51:45] he told her what she did is that right
[51:49] that same Angel was God and the same
[51:52] angel that was there was promised by
[51:55] Jesus who was God
[51:59] and the same God that was there was
[52:03] promised by Jesus who was God to appear
[52:06] in the last days before the burning of
[52:10] the Earth
[52:11] just like he did in the days of Sodom
[52:15] remember Sodom was a gentile Kingdom
[52:20] we see the atomic bombs all getting
[52:22] ready
[52:24] tell Brian says watch Russia watch
[52:27] Russia
[52:28] amen so that's that's
[52:31] starting to to move
[52:34] but in the meantime the bride is making
[52:36] preparation
[52:38] there's a change taking place
[52:40] from glory to glory he's changing me
[52:43] from the Earthly to the heavenly his
[52:47] likeness His Image perfected in me the
[52:50] love that God shows to his bride
[52:52] so we must become more heavenly
[52:55] a Heavenly nature heavenly
[52:58] atmosphere a presence that's now with
[53:01] the bride of Jesus Christ
[53:04] amen so the prophet says here to my back
[53:09] in the message with Melchizedek
[53:12] there's a man sitting behind me he's
[53:14] contacting God
[53:16] and what is he wanting he has got a baby
[53:19] that's got heart trouble and the baby's
[53:22] got a murmur in his heart so the doctor
[53:25] said and that man's name is Mr Cox stand
[53:28] up Mr Cox and he told Sarah what she was
[53:32] thinking behind him
[53:34] was that William Branham
[53:37] no that was God coming
[53:39] using the vocal cords of William Branham
[53:42] and telling Sarah who was in the tent
[53:44] behind her just to show you that that
[53:47] what happened in Genesis Chapter 18 has
[53:49] come here at the end time just before
[53:51] the destruction of Sodom and gemara
[53:55] so he appears to the Royal seat of Abram
[53:58] and nobody is aware of the change
[54:02] accept the bride
[54:05] something is happening within us
[54:07] spiritually
[54:09] we are becoming more like him
[54:12] we are drawing closer to heaven
[54:15] there's a pool within us
[54:17] to draw it closer becoming more in the
[54:20] image of Christ
[54:22] so after the Lord's personal appearance
[54:25] and promise of the coming son to Abram
[54:28] the change was in process
[54:33] so immediately after Melchizedek
[54:35] appeared the change was in process
[54:40] because the word was spoken amen and
[54:43] that word was spoken to the heart of
[54:46] Abram and Sarah and that word was
[54:49] bringing about the transformation
[54:51] for the changing of the body to meet the
[54:55] promised son
[54:57] one day Sarah
[54:59] just looked at Abram
[55:01] she said honey do you realize that your
[55:04] shoulders are straightening out
[55:08] Abram told Sarah your hair is becoming
[55:11] black again
[55:14] Sarah looked at Abram and she says I
[55:17] notice your shoulders
[55:19] are straightening up
[55:20] you look like a young man again your
[55:23] ball patch has disappeared
[55:26] your beard is gone
[55:29] and these things are real things it's
[55:31] gonna happen
[55:32] you know now then I look in the mirror I
[55:34] see if there's any
[55:35] change taking place but brother and
[55:37] sister it's a promise
[55:39] it could happen any moment
[55:41] it could happen during the service it
[55:43] could happen after the service it could
[55:45] happen any moment the changing of the
[55:48] body
[55:49] Hallelujah
[55:51] and after the Lord spoke to them the
[55:53] drought hit the country
[55:56] and they got on a camel and they
[55:58] traveled for 300 miles
[56:01] to giraffe
[56:03] brother Brian says what a trip for an
[56:05] old couple
[56:06] he says they must have been changed
[56:10] Prophet says just wait till we get into
[56:13] our glorified bodies he says it's going
[56:17] to be marvelous can you imagine there
[56:19] will be no elderly folk we'll all be the
[56:22] same age
[56:24] Amen in the Splendor of Youth
[56:27] amen those who have no hair they're
[56:29] going to have a crop full of hair when
[56:31] you were at your best that is what the
[56:33] promise is with the Rapture I'm looking
[56:36] forward to that
[56:37] Amen to be changed in a moment
[56:40] so we find in Genesis chapter 17 verse
[56:43] 1. God appeared to Abram
[56:48] and it says yeah and when Abram was 90
[56:51] years old and nine the Lord appeared to
[56:54] Abram and said unto him I am the
[56:56] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[57:01] perfect
[57:03] now brother Brandon says that God
[57:04] appeared to Abram in different ways in
[57:08] Visions in dreams but in Genesis Chapter
[57:11] 18 the Bible says the Lord appears
[57:16] let's read it and the Lord appeared unto
[57:19] him in the plains of memory
[57:23] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[57:25] of the day
[57:27] and he lived up his eyes and looked and
[57:30] low three men stood by him
[57:35] and he saw them and he ran to me there
[57:38] before the 10 door and bowed himself
[57:41] towards the ground and he recognized one
[57:45] to be the Lord
[57:48] likewise the Royal seat of Abram
[57:51] at the end time they'll recognize that
[57:54] one person
[57:55] who has the manifestation of the Lord at
[57:59] the end time
[58:01] will turn his back to the congregation
[58:04] Hallelujah now the prophet identifies
[58:07] the three men
[58:09] one Oral Roberts
[58:12] the other one is Billy Graham
[58:15] and the one has a name with seven
[58:18] letters which ends with h-a-m
[58:22] Ile amen he doesn't say William Brennan
[58:24] but you know
[58:25] you've got to get the revelation of who
[58:28] that one is
[58:29] but we find in Genesis 19 is a
[58:32] destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
[58:36] now in Genesis chapter 20 verses 1 to 2
[58:39] Abraham and Sarah went through a body
[58:42] change
[58:43] to meet the promised son
[58:46] amen now we find here that
[58:50] if we want to read it hypothetically or
[58:53] supposedly
[58:55] you know
[58:56] when Abraham and Sarah got to Gerard
[59:02] when Grandma and Grandpa got there at
[59:06] the place
[59:07] where they took their journey to
[59:10] with a little black cap on
[59:12] and a little thick in the hand bending
[59:16] over shoulder over the shoulders when
[59:18] she got there
[59:20] and this King was looking for
[59:24] a wife
[59:26] amen is a young man and here comes this
[59:28] old woman
[59:30] there must have been something
[59:32] he must have seen something
[59:34] amen this was not an old woman this is
[59:36] what the prophet says we know
[59:37] immediately after that he took a trip
[59:39] and went to Gerard is that right
[59:42] measured on your map 300 miles by camel
[59:48] quite a trip for an old couple like that
[59:50] Grandma here a little stick a little
[59:53] show
[59:54] she comes with Abram 300 and something
[59:57] miles down to zero is that right the
[59:59] Bible says they went down there
[1:00:01] and you know the strange thing it was
[1:00:04] after a little grandma and them coming
[1:00:07] down there and great great grandpa Abram
[1:00:10] long beard an old grandma with his
[1:00:14] little soul on her on her and the king
[1:00:17] of Gerald was looking for a sweetheart
[1:00:19] all those beautiful women all day around
[1:00:22] him he could have chosen any beautiful
[1:00:25] woman
[1:00:26] any woman he wanted
[1:00:28] and and when you saw Sarah he says
[1:00:31] that's the one I've been looking for all
[1:00:33] of my life
[1:00:35] amen the most beautiful thing in the
[1:00:38] world ridiculous nonsense she was a
[1:00:41] little she wasn't a little grandma
[1:00:44] God turned her back to a young beautiful
[1:00:48] woman again
[1:00:50] that's what he's going to do to every
[1:00:53] one of you in the rapture
[1:00:56] amen something to look forward to
[1:00:59] to be changed young again
[1:01:01] amen especially the elderly Folk
[1:01:04] amen we will really appreciate it
[1:01:06] because young amen
[1:01:10] can you imagine the king with all those
[1:01:12] pretty girls but when you see Sarah he
[1:01:15] said there's the one I waited for
[1:01:18] amen no Sarah was a beautiful young
[1:01:22] woman
[1:01:23] amen and and God changed her back to
[1:01:28] around 25 years old brother Branham says
[1:01:31] 25 years old
[1:01:33] now in Genesis 20 verse 1 after the
[1:01:36] change
[1:01:36] Abram said that Sarah
[1:01:39] his wife she is my sister
[1:01:42] an abimelech uh said and he took Sarah
[1:01:46] now the reason why he took Sarah
[1:01:50] he wanted to marry her
[1:01:54] but defined in a few chapters if you
[1:01:56] read it before Genesis chapter 20. Sarah
[1:02:00] was pretty when she was a young woman
[1:02:04] and Abram lied there as well when they
[1:02:07] went to Egypt
[1:02:09] and said tell them you are my sister
[1:02:13] and here we find in Genesis chapter 20.
[1:02:16] said it was changed back to a former
[1:02:19] Beauty again
[1:02:22] but Sarah did not only have a facelift
[1:02:27] Sarah had a body change
[1:02:31] she was made fertile in order to meet
[1:02:34] the promised son
[1:02:36] Hallelujah
[1:02:38] Sarah was changed back to a brand new
[1:02:42] young beautiful woman again
[1:02:45] Not only was she made beautiful but also
[1:02:48] fruitful
[1:02:50] and the king of giraffe fell in love
[1:02:53] with her
[1:02:54] and the prophet says don't use some of
[1:02:57] this year manicure
[1:02:59] you put on your lips or whatever it is
[1:03:03] you don't need that
[1:03:06] no you don't need that you need Jesus
[1:03:10] Christ
[1:03:11] he'll put it there permanently
[1:03:14] every desire amen he's going to put it
[1:03:17] there permanently one of these days
[1:03:20] hallelujah that's right don't Fashion
[1:03:23] After Hollywood out there
[1:03:26] Fashion After heaven
[1:03:30] that's what you want to do
[1:03:33] amen excuse me
[1:03:38] now the Bible says that the king took
[1:03:40] Sarah
[1:03:43] with the intention of marrying her
[1:03:47] he was going to prepare her now for
[1:03:49] marriage to be his wife
[1:03:51] as the prophet says you know he that
[1:03:54] night after he took his bath and laid in
[1:03:56] his bed
[1:03:57] he stretched forth his big feet on the
[1:03:59] bed he says Lord I am so happy
[1:04:03] you gave me a pretty girl
[1:04:06] ignorant of the fact that it was another
[1:04:08] man's wife
[1:04:10] Hallelujah but he was brother Brian says
[1:04:13] he was a righteous man
[1:04:16] while he slept that night the Lord came
[1:04:19] and told him you're as good as a dead
[1:04:22] man
[1:04:23] he said Lord but why am I as good as a
[1:04:27] dead man
[1:04:29] he said you got another man's wife with
[1:04:32] you
[1:04:34] God was protecting the bloodstream of
[1:04:38] the royal seed
[1:04:40] Jesus Christ was to come through that
[1:04:42] bloodstream and he was protecting that
[1:04:44] stream
[1:04:45] that's what we find that God protects
[1:04:48] the Covenant people
[1:04:51] we just commit ourselves to him
[1:04:54] then he takes care of the rest
[1:04:57] remember God said I'll be a god unto you
[1:05:01] and to your seed after you in their
[1:05:04] generation it's a covenant which God
[1:05:07] made with Abram and he said
[1:05:10] and brother Bradham says that the faith
[1:05:11] of Abram was not necessarily Isaac but
[1:05:15] he was looking forward to the coming of
[1:05:17] Jesus Christ and his faith was for the
[1:05:21] union between spirit and flesh
[1:05:25] amen and while John was baptizing him
[1:05:28] the Spirit came down and it came into
[1:05:30] the body of Jesus he says this is my
[1:05:34] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:05:37] dwell yeah him amen not yeah him just
[1:05:40] you know I'm well pleased to dwell
[1:05:42] and he went to Calvary in order to pay
[1:05:45] the price of our Redemption
[1:05:49] so that he could shed his blood to
[1:05:52] sanctify a church
[1:05:54] Pentecost
[1:05:56] amen the pillar of fire came
[1:06:00] and it separated itself and came into
[1:06:03] that first church
[1:06:05] on the day of Pentecost
[1:06:08] and the prophecies that were two
[1:06:10] thousand years the Holy Ghost was bound
[1:06:12] by denominational Creeds and dogmas the
[1:06:16] purifier was not seen for 2 000 years
[1:06:19] and after two thousand years the pillar
[1:06:22] of fire makes its appearance again
[1:06:25] Hallelujah that's why there could be no
[1:06:27] restoration without the return of the
[1:06:31] pillar of Fire
[1:06:32] because now it's going to be a union
[1:06:35] between the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[1:06:38] Earthly bride God dividing himself his
[1:06:41] attributes now in a many-membered body
[1:06:43] around the world with the true baptism
[1:06:47] of the Holy Ghost Christ the person of
[1:06:50] Christ now being united in a
[1:06:52] many-membered body in the bride of
[1:06:55] Christ universally
[1:06:57] that's why Pentecost they fell out by
[1:06:59] the way
[1:07:00] because they do not continue on
[1:07:02] believing the word they rejected the
[1:07:04] word so they rejected him
[1:07:07] amen so we find the king said you know
[1:07:10] the Integrity of my heart
[1:07:13] amen
[1:07:16] and she told me that was her brother
[1:07:20] and he told me that that was his sister
[1:07:24] and God said I know the Integrity of
[1:07:27] your heart that is why I kept you from
[1:07:30] sending me
[1:07:31] and God said I know you are a good man
[1:07:35] you are a righteous man
[1:07:37] your everything is just good
[1:07:40] but I'll not hear your prayers
[1:07:42] why because he was not in the promise of
[1:07:46] the Seed of Abraham
[1:07:48] you see this message this Covenant is
[1:07:51] directed to a specific seed
[1:07:55] all those that are in the Covenant that
[1:07:58] God made with Abraham
[1:08:01] so our message goes all the way back to
[1:08:03] Genesis to Father Abram
[1:08:06] amen and we find that angel Revelation
[1:08:08] 10 is a covenant angel
[1:08:11] with a rainbow upon his head
[1:08:14] he's coming now to the Covenant people
[1:08:17] those who made a covenant with God by
[1:08:19] sacrifice
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:22] so we find that there's only one true
[1:08:26] faith upon the Earth today
[1:08:29] and the other ones is according to the
[1:08:31] Covenant that God made with Father Abram
[1:08:35] it goes all the way back
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:39] brother Brian says once God makes one
[1:08:41] decision he cannot change his mind
[1:08:44] he's got to continue throughout the
[1:08:45] scripture
[1:08:47] and he promised to be a god unto Abram
[1:08:49] and to recede and to the seed after him
[1:08:52] in their generation
[1:08:55] see and yet we find a God-fearing man
[1:08:58] and God refused to hear his prayers
[1:09:01] you see
[1:09:02] because the Covenant was only between
[1:09:05] Abram
[1:09:06] and he said
[1:09:09] he said her husband is my prophet
[1:09:12] he was a liar and Abram was backsled
[1:09:16] because he left the Promised Land
[1:09:19] but he said let him pray for you
[1:09:21] my Covenant is with Abram
[1:09:24] Hallelujah so that shows where we stand
[1:09:27] as far as the Covenant God answers your
[1:09:32] prayer God hears your prayer because you
[1:09:36] are part of the Covenant that God made
[1:09:38] with Abram that's why this message
[1:09:40] reaches out
[1:09:42] to the seed of Abram
[1:09:44] nothing else amen it was displayed only
[1:09:47] Melchizedek was only manifested for the
[1:09:51] benefit of the Seed of Abraham because
[1:09:54] what happened to Abraham in Genesis
[1:09:56] happens to the Royal seed at the end
[1:09:58] time Hallelujah do you love the Lord
[1:10:00] tonight let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:10:02] Praise amen
[1:10:07] and the problem is that people who think
[1:10:09] they have done wrong
[1:10:11] that the Lord won't heal him
[1:10:13] that God is going to condemn them
[1:10:17] he says repent for what you've done
[1:10:21] wrong
[1:10:22] that don't mean that God has forsaken
[1:10:25] you
[1:10:26] repent and go on
[1:10:29] do you know it's only the bride of
[1:10:30] Christ that can really repent
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:35] it's difficult for people to repent
[1:10:37] you get people coming to the service the
[1:10:39] call goes out
[1:10:41] nobody wants to repent it's only the
[1:10:44] seed of Abram those who are part of the
[1:10:47] Covenant
[1:10:48] they are the only ones that will repent
[1:10:52] they are the only ones that affected by
[1:10:55] the message of the hour
[1:10:57] because this message is directed to you
[1:11:00] Amen brother Brandon says in
[1:11:02] unconditional Covenant now a righteous
[1:11:05] man
[1:11:06] done nothing
[1:11:07] but he wasn't the Seed of Abraham
[1:11:12] he didn't a good man a God-fearing man
[1:11:16] but he wasn't the Seed of Abraham
[1:11:21] Hallelujah that's why Revelation 13 8
[1:11:24] says and the Beast that was to come on
[1:11:26] the earth will deceive all those whose
[1:11:30] names were not written in the Lamb's
[1:11:33] Book of Life
[1:11:35] Hallelujah see he says here
[1:11:38] it don't give you permission to sin
[1:11:43] remember that but what I'm trying to get
[1:11:46] this the fear knocked out of you
[1:11:48] you're always scared about something
[1:11:52] don't be scared God has promised
[1:11:56] God has got to do it if you believe it
[1:11:58] if you are the seed of Abram someone
[1:12:01] said to me like my Baptist friends used
[1:12:04] to say what difference does it make
[1:12:07] the one that went off into eternal
[1:12:10] security
[1:12:12] they said why it don't make any
[1:12:15] difference to me I'm saved glory to God
[1:12:18] I can do what I want to
[1:12:21] the prophet says that just shows that
[1:12:24] you not saved
[1:12:27] if you are saved you don't want to do
[1:12:30] those things
[1:12:31] those things such as dancing and God
[1:12:35] parties and playing and bobbing your
[1:12:37] hair and painting your lips and
[1:12:39] manicuring your face and all the things
[1:12:42] or attributes of unbelief
[1:12:46] that hurts Pentecost but that's what's
[1:12:49] good for you brother
[1:12:51] couldn't walk the old straight narrow
[1:12:54] path
[1:12:54] just like a hog going to its wallow and
[1:12:58] a dog to its vomit
[1:13:00] that's where the Pentecostal church has
[1:13:04] returned
[1:13:06] he says all right if you are born again
[1:13:09] the spirit of God will be a record that
[1:13:13] them things are wrong
[1:13:15] here there's got to be something here
[1:13:17] that brings a conviction
[1:13:19] there's no conviction because there's no
[1:13:21] Holy Ghost you can do it without any
[1:13:23] feeling any guilt but if the Holy Ghost
[1:13:26] is there it's going to keep you
[1:13:27] it's going to tell everybody that's
[1:13:28] wrong you shouldn't do that you
[1:13:31] shouldn't be saying that amen see
[1:13:34] you know that's true and here come your
[1:13:37] latter rain and scattering whatever it
[1:13:39] was and collaboration of woman and
[1:13:43] everything like that each of those Grace
[1:13:44] brother Branham says it's the works of
[1:13:47] the devil you owned you ain't going to
[1:13:51] love me after tonight
[1:13:54] amen you also love me after tonight
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:57] but brother when I meet you at the
[1:14:00] Judgment bar I'm going to clearly be
[1:14:01] clean of the thing
[1:14:03] that's one thing sure I'm going to tell
[1:14:06] you the truth about it
[1:14:08] so God told Abraham not to leave
[1:14:12] Palestine
[1:14:13] and any person that disobeys God isn't a
[1:14:17] backslidden condition
[1:14:20] amen and any person who leaves the
[1:14:23] promised land of the son of man of the
[1:14:26] message of the hour is in a back
[1:14:28] slitting condition
[1:14:30] there is no promise outside of the
[1:14:33] message of the hour
[1:14:35] see when droughts struck the country
[1:14:38] instead of Abram facing the music he did
[1:14:41] exactly what God told him not to do
[1:14:44] and he backslid
[1:14:46] in his new body
[1:14:48] amen that wasn't his glorified body so
[1:14:51] this is a body that was so subject to go
[1:14:53] through the grave but he be excellent
[1:14:55] amen but God couldn't turn him down
[1:14:59] God made an unconditional Covenant with
[1:15:02] Abram
[1:15:03] this is my prophet take uh take his wife
[1:15:08] to him and if you don't you're as good
[1:15:10] as a dead man
[1:15:11] not the holier than thou priest
[1:15:14] or somebody you know that maybe was more
[1:15:17] Holier even than Abram but my Prophet
[1:15:20] out there let him pray for you my
[1:15:23] Covenant is between him and me
[1:15:26] the prophet said there's the grace of
[1:15:28] God to the Holy Ghost Church you don't
[1:15:31] recognize it
[1:15:33] the Covenant that God made with Abram
[1:15:35] and his seed after him
[1:15:38] we don't he says we don't deserve our
[1:15:41] healing
[1:15:43] any every one of us deserves to die
[1:15:47] there's not one of us that deserves to
[1:15:50] hear the gospel
[1:15:52] there's not one of us that deserves the
[1:15:54] grace of Jesus Christ
[1:15:56] we don't deserve to live on the Earth
[1:15:59] we are not deserving to look to God's
[1:16:02] creation
[1:16:03] but God has made a covenant with Abram
[1:16:06] and his seed after him
[1:16:09] healing belongs to us
[1:16:13] the Holy Ghost belongs to us
[1:16:16] salvation belongs to us
[1:16:20] amen and we are sitting in Heavenly
[1:16:22] places tonight nothing can harm us amen
[1:16:26] we are the seed of Abram
[1:16:28] and His blessings rest upon us
[1:16:32] so guarded to Abram and Sarah what he
[1:16:35] was going to do to the Covenant seed
[1:16:38] he was going to follow the same pattern
[1:16:43] so the last sign before the change come
[1:16:48] he appeared in human flesh
[1:16:51] giving Abram and Sarah the promise
[1:16:56] that was the beginning of the change
[1:16:59] that was the mystery of the change
[1:17:03] God appearing in human flesh
[1:17:07] because the next thing now was the
[1:17:09] changing of the body to meet the
[1:17:11] promised son
[1:17:13] listen to what the brother Branham says
[1:17:14] here I'm going to read a couple of
[1:17:15] quotations that you can see how that the
[1:17:17] prophet of God
[1:17:19] position he places us
[1:17:21] he says in the message Feast of the
[1:17:23] trumpets
[1:17:24] paragraph 302.
[1:17:27] God changed her body
[1:17:31] and turn them back
[1:17:33] it's a mystery that's to be revealed in
[1:17:38] this day by the son of man
[1:17:43] the evening message see
[1:17:47] turn back
[1:17:48] and that was the last sign they seen
[1:17:52] that discernment before the changing of
[1:17:56] the body
[1:17:58] so we're looking for nothing else but
[1:18:00] the changing of the body
[1:18:04] and before we can ever receive the Sun
[1:18:07] what happens The Trumpet Of God shall
[1:18:10] sound
[1:18:11] the dead in Christ shall rise first a
[1:18:14] new body and we which are alive and
[1:18:17] remain shall be changed in a moment in
[1:18:19] the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah and
[1:18:22] shall be caught up together to meet the
[1:18:25] Lord in the air
[1:18:26] listen
[1:18:27] the secret has been made known
[1:18:31] the seals are open
[1:18:35] the trumpet sound is for the Israel
[1:18:37] the two prophets is ready to appear
[1:18:41] what is it the church must get off the
[1:18:45] scene right now
[1:18:47] so that they can appear
[1:18:50] he can't deal with two at the same time
[1:18:53] he never did
[1:18:56] so the bride is was going to be taken
[1:18:58] off the scene
[1:19:00] amen she's got to be dismissed to the
[1:19:03] Palace
[1:19:04] before Joseph can make himself known
[1:19:07] to his brethren
[1:19:09] amen
[1:19:11] this is what he says in Jehovah Jireh
[1:19:13] paragraph 92.
[1:19:15] and that's the next thing in the order
[1:19:18] for the church
[1:19:21] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:19:24] them which are asleep for that for we
[1:19:27] shall be changed in the moment to
[1:19:29] receive the promised son
[1:19:32] where is he going to come down on Earth
[1:19:35] no up in the air
[1:19:37] and we don't meet him on Earth we
[1:19:40] couldn't meet him in these kind of
[1:19:42] bodies we've got to be changed and meet
[1:19:45] him in the air
[1:19:47] I really feel religious brother Branham
[1:19:49] says the body will be changed in a
[1:19:52] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:19:55] you know how many times your eyes
[1:19:56] twinkle
[1:19:57] and you don't even realize
[1:20:00] it's just bad it's a twinkling of an eye
[1:20:02] and that's how fast you are going to be
[1:20:04] changed from from Mortal to immortality
[1:20:09] he says the next thing to the seed of
[1:20:11] Abram you are getting their lost sign
[1:20:16] a discernment just like it was in Jesus
[1:20:21] name that's the last sign to the church
[1:20:26] he says in Abram's Grace Covenant
[1:20:28] what's the next thing after his sign
[1:20:32] goes away
[1:20:34] God's going to condition you know I
[1:20:38] believe the prophet is inspired to use
[1:20:42] the words that he uses
[1:20:44] and I looked up the word condition what
[1:20:47] does the word condition mean it means to
[1:20:50] bring something into the desired state
[1:20:53] for use
[1:20:55] so God sent us a message
[1:20:58] to bring us into the desired state
[1:21:02] for a body change
[1:21:04] this message is our preparation
[1:21:07] from the change from Mortal to
[1:21:10] immortality
[1:21:12] he says Abram's children getting ready
[1:21:15] to receive the promised son
[1:21:19] agas appeared but now we are getting
[1:21:23] ready
[1:21:24] the change is in process
[1:21:28] amen so we don't just come to church
[1:21:31] you know for the second coming church
[1:21:33] but you are getting ready
[1:21:34] for a body change we are getting
[1:21:37] condition
[1:21:39] for the changing of the body
[1:21:41] how are we going to receive him we can't
[1:21:43] receive him in these bodies we are going
[1:21:46] to meet him in the air praise God
[1:21:47] forever the trumpet shall sound the
[1:21:50] dating Christ shall rise will go up to
[1:21:52] meet him in the air
[1:21:53] what's he doing the Lost sign before the
[1:21:58] Transfiguration
[1:22:00] the Lost sign before the rapture
[1:22:05] for most any time the atomic bombs are
[1:22:08] going to destroy the world
[1:22:10] seems like it's we are in that situation
[1:22:13] now at most any time the atomic bombs
[1:22:16] are going to destroy the world
[1:22:19] before it screams into the tapes Jesus
[1:22:21] is coming
[1:22:23] weaves are alive and remain shall not
[1:22:25] prevent or hinder those that are asleep
[1:22:27] for the trumpet of God shall sound and
[1:22:30] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:22:34] he says movies are alive and be changed
[1:22:36] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:22:39] an old man will be young
[1:22:42] old woman will be young again and will
[1:22:45] be conditioned he uses the word again
[1:22:49] be conditioned to meet the promised son
[1:22:53] Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's
[1:22:56] order what happens just as the angel had
[1:23:00] his back turned and showing that sign to
[1:23:02] Abram he brought everything down through
[1:23:05] justification
[1:23:06] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:09] Ghost the placing of sons the gifts and
[1:23:12] orders to come out and then showing his
[1:23:15] lost sign
[1:23:17] law sign the peering of Melchizedek
[1:23:21] to the Royal seat of Abram and then
[1:23:24] changed Abram's seeds it might come
[1:23:27] before we close the meeting
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:32] he says we all have to become Young
[1:23:34] man and woman again change why do we
[1:23:37] have to be changed it was totally
[1:23:39] impossible for that old man to have
[1:23:42] sexual relationship with his wife
[1:23:45] it was totally impossible for her to
[1:23:47] conceive and be a child
[1:23:50] if the supernatural taken place and the
[1:23:53] only way it could be done would be have
[1:23:56] to be a transformation
[1:24:00] amen
[1:24:01] let me just read this one he says
[1:24:03] Abram's Grace Covenant oh Church
[1:24:06] he will have to change this physical
[1:24:09] being
[1:24:10] to let us be caught up
[1:24:13] you must be changed to a body that will
[1:24:15] be caught up
[1:24:17] we first will see those that are asleep
[1:24:19] they'll have a resurrection and when we
[1:24:22] see them we are changed and we'll see
[1:24:25] who made it we didn't make it
[1:24:27] and then together we'll rise
[1:24:30] we'll meet the Lord in the air
[1:24:32] God's own son will be the leading one
[1:24:36] brother Branham says God tell us first
[1:24:39] be upon the Earth for a while see who
[1:24:42] made it who did not make it whatever
[1:24:44] but when we all rise together to meet
[1:24:46] the Lord in the air our Focus will be
[1:24:49] upon him
[1:24:51] God's own son will be the leading one in
[1:24:55] that meeting in the air
[1:24:57] he says yeah we're going to meet the
[1:24:59] Lord in the air
[1:25:00] we can go up like this
[1:25:03] we see every sign justification
[1:25:06] amen Hallelujah
[1:25:09] now we notice God's lost sign to Abram
[1:25:13] literally was God the word
[1:25:16] remember God the promised were that had
[1:25:20] been promised to him all along
[1:25:23] spoke to him in human flesh
[1:25:27] a man standing there
[1:25:30] talking to him Discerning the thoughts
[1:25:32] that was in Sarah's heart
[1:25:36] and her back behind him saying that the
[1:25:40] scripture even says the Bible said who
[1:25:42] was in a tent behind him
[1:25:45] yeah just to bring out at the end time
[1:25:47] he will stand with his back
[1:25:49] the man William Branham but he would
[1:25:52] discern the people with his back turn to
[1:25:55] Sarah a type amen and discern the
[1:25:58] thoughts of Sarah's heart
[1:26:01] that was the last I noticed he had
[1:26:03] before he had appeared to him in many
[1:26:06] symbols and so forth lights and fire and
[1:26:10] so forth but now notice immediately
[1:26:13] but he's doing to Sarah and Abram
[1:26:17] coming along this way just like he
[1:26:19] promised to do to the seed
[1:26:22] he's done it
[1:26:24] I can prove that just exactly the steps
[1:26:27] that Abram took
[1:26:29] now Luke where he's at here now when God
[1:26:32] came and talked to him in human flesh
[1:26:35] made himself hallelujah amen just to
[1:26:40] conserve time I'm going to skip a lot of
[1:26:42] things and I'm going to say
[1:26:44] how
[1:26:46] did the change take place
[1:26:48] since Melchizedek
[1:26:51] appeared to the Royal seed of Abram at
[1:26:54] the end time
[1:26:55] now brother Branham explains here in the
[1:26:58] message questions and answers
[1:27:00] exactly how the change is now taking
[1:27:04] place
[1:27:05] he says the first conscious this body
[1:27:08] would see tasteful smell and hear and it
[1:27:12] just got us all scrupled up we reason
[1:27:15] everything else
[1:27:17] but the new body that comes from the
[1:27:21] bone again
[1:27:23] not the first conscious it will pass
[1:27:25] away
[1:27:26] it's that inside something that lives
[1:27:31] everybody understands it
[1:27:33] see that attribute that was in God
[1:27:36] that little part of you that existed
[1:27:38] before it was a star a molecule or an
[1:27:40] atom is now become quickened within you
[1:27:43] that is where the Rapture is starting
[1:27:47] From the Inside Man
[1:27:49] he says here
[1:27:51] amen he said it's not this outside sea
[1:27:55] tasteful smell in here
[1:27:57] it's subject to death and will die
[1:28:00] see but the inside part of you
[1:28:05] down here
[1:28:06] inside that is the person that cannot
[1:28:10] die
[1:28:11] and that's the person that the New Life
[1:28:14] starts to form from
[1:28:16] from this new birth
[1:28:18] and it builds another person in the
[1:28:20] image of this person you are
[1:28:23] around that life
[1:28:25] you get it
[1:28:27] as Paul says my little children are
[1:28:29] travail in birth again until Christ be
[1:28:32] formed in you
[1:28:35] see so the mother baby forms inside the
[1:28:39] mother's womb
[1:28:40] then it's begotten it's just muscle
[1:28:44] it gets his body from the food and the
[1:28:46] mother feeds the baby
[1:28:48] she craves for certain things all in the
[1:28:50] development of the baby
[1:28:53] amen but then on the outside there's a
[1:28:56] spirit brother branches and the
[1:28:57] sweetness around that woman so as soon
[1:29:00] as that baby is dropped the two unite
[1:29:03] together and that's when the baby cries
[1:29:05] amen likewise Paul says when this
[1:29:09] Earthly Tabernacle of a habitation be
[1:29:12] dissolved we have another one waiting
[1:29:16] So within us Christ is being formed
[1:29:21] and it feeds upon the world that you
[1:29:24] feed on
[1:29:25] it makes you more into the word image
[1:29:29] changes you
[1:29:30] amen he says there's therefore no
[1:29:32] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[1:29:34] they walk not after the flesh but after
[1:29:38] the spirit
[1:29:39] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:29:42] but that seed word
[1:29:44] made manifest
[1:29:46] is that part of you that wasn't there
[1:29:48] like a soldier where were you when I
[1:29:51] laid the foundations of the world
[1:29:53] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:29:56] the sons of God shouted for Joy I wonder
[1:29:58] if I got that quotation here
[1:30:00] he says here
[1:30:04] um
[1:30:05] yes he says they shout for Joy when they
[1:30:09] saw the day that Melchizedek would come
[1:30:10] to the Earth
[1:30:12] to pay for our Redemption they saw the
[1:30:14] day when the Redemption would be prayed
[1:30:16] and will be brought back again to where
[1:30:18] we actually belong
[1:30:20] that's why we Rejoice at the ministry of
[1:30:22] the word because there's something
[1:30:24] within us amen we Rejoice that we are
[1:30:27] going back we are to our ought to be
[1:30:29] condition you see you're your first
[1:30:31] birth was because of the seed of your
[1:30:35] natural Earthly father
[1:30:37] amen but when you are born again is from
[1:30:40] your heavenly father and you are growing
[1:30:42] from more from days or today Christ is
[1:30:45] being formed within you amen so it's
[1:30:48] based on exactly the same principle amen
[1:30:52] he says here that um
[1:30:57] amen
[1:31:02] okay
[1:31:03] here it is
[1:31:08] I'm sorry I just
[1:31:19] okay here it is
[1:31:21] so potentially it's in here
[1:31:26] you're walking with the rapture
[1:31:28] in you it's already in process
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:33] and what is it the word promised before
[1:31:37] the foundation of the world
[1:31:40] and around there this only reflects the
[1:31:44] negative
[1:31:45] that will reflect the process of the
[1:31:47] word
[1:31:48] see that's why it says that inner man
[1:31:51] brings us outer man into subjection
[1:31:53] to its nature you are a new creation you
[1:31:56] are a brand new man
[1:31:58] amen all things are passed away you are
[1:32:01] absolutely now governed by that
[1:32:04] attribute of God
[1:32:06] has been quickened within you
[1:32:09] see
[1:32:10] and the same thing or the translation of
[1:32:12] the Bride will be the same thing the
[1:32:15] word that's in you
[1:32:18] what's that word the attribute of God
[1:32:20] you know I like this message
[1:32:22] brother Brandon brings you from where
[1:32:25] you were before you are here now
[1:32:27] from where you were in the mind of God
[1:32:30] amen and he says God's thought of you
[1:32:34] and the Very thought that he had before
[1:32:37] the foundation of the world he presents
[1:32:39] that same thought to you in a word
[1:32:41] it is that word that brings you back
[1:32:44] amen you are identified with that same
[1:32:46] thought amen that's why it says when you
[1:32:48] recognize this to be Eagle food you have
[1:32:51] heard from your theophany
[1:32:54] amen hallelujah we should be the most
[1:32:57] happiest people in all the world for
[1:33:00] what has been made known unto us now we
[1:33:03] are the sons of God Amen he says here
[1:33:07] the word that's in you
[1:33:10] the body will materialize around that
[1:33:13] word
[1:33:14] and the same thing did by Sarah
[1:33:18] when that old body that she had
[1:33:22] that first body it had to be changed in
[1:33:26] order to produce a sun you get it
[1:33:31] that body could not do it this body
[1:33:34] cannot do it so it'll have to be changed
[1:33:37] the same way
[1:33:38] to receive the promised son
[1:33:42] so it's already now working within you
[1:33:46] there's a power that's bringing this
[1:33:47] body in subjection something in you that
[1:33:49] told you I must get to the house of the
[1:33:51] Lord tonight something that's pulling
[1:33:53] you
[1:33:54] into the presence of the Lord
[1:33:57] this world is absolutely dead
[1:33:59] but something has been quickened within
[1:34:01] you
[1:34:02] day and night you are walking with us
[1:34:04] it's a revelation it's a reality to you
[1:34:06] it's not a struggle to serve the Lord
[1:34:09] because you are all part you are the
[1:34:11] word made flesh today
[1:34:13] amen improving his word the prophet says
[1:34:17] the one man stayed behind that talked to
[1:34:19] Abram and he'd done a sign to Abram
[1:34:22] watch Abram had seen God in many great
[1:34:24] things see
[1:34:26] we believe that we don't we just before
[1:34:29] the coming son but before the sun was
[1:34:31] manifested there was a sign given unto
[1:34:35] them
[1:34:35] when Melchizedek appeared
[1:34:38] so Melchizedek might be just a beautiful
[1:34:41] sermon
[1:34:43] but to the seed of Abram it's a mystery
[1:34:48] that's been unfolded to us in this day
[1:34:50] that was the beginning of the change
[1:34:53] amen God spoke the word
[1:34:58] I would just like to read you you see
[1:35:00] when he said I'll give you a son
[1:35:02] you are going to have that son
[1:35:05] didn't tell them how it was going to
[1:35:06] happen I'm going to change your body I'm
[1:35:08] going to do this that or the other
[1:35:10] everything they require
[1:35:13] to manifest or to bring forth that son
[1:35:15] was in the promise
[1:35:18] likewise with the rapture there's going
[1:35:21] to be a rapture
[1:35:23] everything we require for the body
[1:35:26] change is in the promise this is what he
[1:35:30] says
[1:35:31] in closing
[1:35:33] just in closing now
[1:35:36] the second Resurrection
[1:35:39] first one is past
[1:35:41] the second one is at hand right now
[1:35:45] will come to your hand right now
[1:35:47] the third one is the two witnesses of
[1:35:51] Revelations 11 11 and 12. which are the
[1:35:54] two
[1:35:56] which are the ones that turns back with
[1:35:59] the spirit of Christ to witness to the
[1:36:01] Jews Like Joseph
[1:36:03] see
[1:36:04] there's your three raptures of the New
[1:36:07] Testament
[1:36:09] three raptures of the Old Testament all
[1:36:12] of them passed
[1:36:13] now we are already waiting for the
[1:36:15] rapture
[1:36:16] the Rapture of the Saints
[1:36:19] it's been spoken
[1:36:23] and so shall it be
[1:36:27] When God says anything
[1:36:30] all Heavens on Earth will pass away
[1:36:34] but the word will never fail
[1:36:38] so the Rapture is already in motion the
[1:36:41] change is already in motion it has been
[1:36:45] spoken
[1:36:46] so shall it be
[1:36:49] he says there when God said back then
[1:36:51] Genesis 1 let there be light
[1:36:54] it might have been hundreds of years
[1:36:56] before there was any light
[1:36:58] let there be a palm tree let there be an
[1:37:01] oak tree let there be a desert let there
[1:37:04] be a mountain let there be this he spoke
[1:37:07] it you see and as long as it went out of
[1:37:10] his mouth
[1:37:11] in a word it has to be manifested
[1:37:16] it has to be
[1:37:18] and one day you call these people out
[1:37:22] spoke to a man named Moses by a pillar
[1:37:25] of Fire
[1:37:26] a holy sacred fire
[1:37:29] see and the people who don't believe
[1:37:31] Moses so he said bring them to this
[1:37:34] mountain
[1:37:35] in that morning the mountain was full of
[1:37:37] fire and flashing and Thunders like that
[1:37:40] and the people says don't let God speak
[1:37:43] let's let Moses speak lest we perish
[1:37:47] and since that day God uses a prophet
[1:37:51] God could have spoken to us directly
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:56] but the people says rather speak to us
[1:38:00] through a prophet
[1:38:02] he says he says and God said I'll not
[1:38:05] speak to them no more like this their
[1:38:07] problem is actually bringing us to a
[1:38:09] point
[1:38:10] where God is actually using him to speak
[1:38:13] I'll not speak to them no more like this
[1:38:15] but I'll raise them up a prophet and
[1:38:18] I'll speak through him
[1:38:20] and what he says will come to pass
[1:38:23] then you hear it because I am with him
[1:38:29] see now we spoke that
[1:38:32] he says that it would come to pass
[1:38:35] then he refers to Isaiah the prophet he
[1:38:38] says a virgin shall conceive I says what
[1:38:41] intelligent man would make a statement
[1:38:43] like that a virgin shall conceive amen
[1:38:46] because there's got to be a relationship
[1:38:49] but he just said it because the spirit
[1:38:51] spoke through him a virgin shall
[1:38:54] conceive
[1:38:56] notice brother Branham says Isaiah that
[1:38:59] intelligent young man standing there all
[1:39:01] at once the spirit hit him and he could
[1:39:03] say no different
[1:39:04] and he was a prophet he says Behold a
[1:39:07] virgin shall conceive
[1:39:08] child is born a son is given his name
[1:39:12] Shall be Called counselor Prince of
[1:39:14] Peace Mighty God
[1:39:17] Everlasting father
[1:39:18] his government shall be upon your
[1:39:20] shoulders the end there shall be no end
[1:39:23] to his reign
[1:39:24] how could that man intelligently say
[1:39:26] that a virgin shall conceive
[1:39:31] everybody looked for it
[1:39:33] but it's done been spoke
[1:39:36] it was thus saith the Lord
[1:39:40] it had to come to pass because it was
[1:39:44] God's word
[1:39:46] that's what we are dealing with me
[1:39:48] speak about the message of the hour
[1:39:50] it is God's word to us in this day
[1:39:54] see the same as it was in Genesis when
[1:39:57] he splanted them seeds down beneath the
[1:39:59] sea
[1:40:00] it was without form and void and the
[1:40:03] water upon the deep sea it had to come
[1:40:06] to pass
[1:40:07] and one day 800 years later the womb of
[1:40:10] a virgin
[1:40:11] conserve this conceive the seed of God a
[1:40:15] created seed she brought forth a son
[1:40:18] that same son stood there one day and
[1:40:21] said Lazarus come forth
[1:40:24] a man that's been dead four days
[1:40:27] rotten he's an Australian sunk he came
[1:40:31] forth said Marvel not at this for the
[1:40:35] hour cometh when all that's in the grave
[1:40:38] will hear the voice of the son of God
[1:40:42] so brother Branham said it's done been
[1:40:45] spoke
[1:40:46] voice of the son of man has already gone
[1:40:49] forth even those are in a grave of
[1:40:52] making preparation
[1:40:54] the views are alive on the earth we are
[1:40:57] also making preparation and the two amen
[1:41:00] will not hinder them but they will come
[1:41:02] first in the resurrection and we shall
[1:41:04] be changed and we shall be like them
[1:41:07] the prophet says it has to happen like
[1:41:10] that
[1:41:11] there is going to be a rapture
[1:41:15] there's going to be we are now in the
[1:41:18] change
[1:41:20] we are in the days amen of Elijah
[1:41:24] we are in the days of the body change we
[1:41:27] are in the days when at any moment
[1:41:30] there could be a changing from Mortal to
[1:41:33] immortality people who come up missing
[1:41:36] amen but we thank God for a message of
[1:41:39] the hour
[1:41:41] that is conditioning us for that moment
[1:41:44] see God wouldn't expect the Rapture and
[1:41:46] not giving you a preparation
[1:41:48] he's getting you ready
[1:41:52] uh the uh amen God is preparing us for
[1:41:56] the body change Hallelujah shall we all
[1:41:59] stand
[1:42:00] Hallelujah
[1:42:05] let's sing a little song from glory to
[1:42:08] glory he's changing me from the Earthly
[1:42:11] to the Heavenly his likeness His Image
[1:42:14] perfected in me the love that God shows
[1:42:18] to his bride amen
[1:42:24] from glory to
[1:42:27] his changing me his changing me
[1:42:34] changing me his likeness sent image to
[1:42:40] perfect in me the love that God shows to
[1:42:45] the world for his
[1:42:49] changing
[1:42:51] changing me from the Earthly things to
[1:42:56] the
[1:42:57] foreign
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:25] the love that God chose to his bride
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:36] from Heaven
[1:43:41] is an image to perfect in me amen
[1:43:49] [Music]
[1:43:53] amen isn't that the truth we're living
[1:43:56] for the Rapture yes amen I I like that
[1:43:59] just the whole
[1:44:02] understanding that the minute this
[1:44:04] messenger came
[1:44:06] the Rapture started amen he was calling
[1:44:09] that bride out
[1:44:11] if the seals were open because in those
[1:44:14] Thunders that sounded out in the seals
[1:44:17] it contained the rapturing faith and
[1:44:20] that's what that's what you're getting
[1:44:22] when you hear the word you're getting
[1:44:24] the rapturing faith so that's in like
[1:44:27] the prophet said this morning he said
[1:44:29] they couldn't recognize the part of the
[1:44:33] age that they were in the part they
[1:44:36] played in the Ager and do you understand
[1:44:38] what what it's all about you are created
[1:44:43] to fulfill the promise you were created
[1:44:47] for the Rapture and Satan is just out
[1:44:50] there trying to throw education
[1:44:53] civilization science he's trying to
[1:44:57] throw so many things in the picture you
[1:44:59] have to deal with he's trying to make
[1:45:02] you create some kind of great big puzzle
[1:45:04] you have to put together you don't have
[1:45:06] to put nothing together
[1:45:09] it's already taken care of you just have
[1:45:12] to what believe he didn't say did you
[1:45:15] understand it he said Do you believe it
[1:45:17] do you believe there's a Rapture amen do
[1:45:21] you believe it could be any day
[1:45:23] amen do you believe you're part of it
[1:45:26] amen amen that ought to be victory in
[1:45:29] itself huh that ought to be able to be
[1:45:32] able to tell you whatever Satan says you
[1:45:36] can give him the final answers Satan
[1:45:38] says well I'm going to take your life
[1:45:39] you say Satan I'm in a rapture
[1:45:42] Satan says you're I'm gonna you're gonna
[1:45:45] lose all your money you're gonna be
[1:45:46] Financial I'm gonna be in a rapture
[1:45:50] nothing he can do to stop it
[1:45:52] amen don't you think that's wonderful
[1:45:55] amen why don't we sing that uh a song uh
[1:46:00] because I think really it really where
[1:46:03] our thoughts ought to be on I'm thinking
[1:46:06] of a rapture
[1:46:07] amen when the redeemed are gathering in
[1:46:11] that's all we're waiting for right is to
[1:46:13] be gathered in uh we know what our
[1:46:16] Prophet brought us you say why the
[1:46:18] message he said because what the church
[1:46:21] world was preaching would not meet the
[1:46:25] challenge of the hour
[1:46:27] what the world preaches
[1:46:30] will not
[1:46:32] give the church what it needs to make a
[1:46:35] Rapture amen you you want to know what
[1:46:38] it takes to make a rapture
[1:46:41] he brought it to you in so many
[1:46:43] different ways in so many different
[1:46:46] sermons it's really the same thing every
[1:46:49] every time it's transforming the bride
[1:46:53] to the word the invisible Union of the
[1:46:58] Heavenly bridegroom in their Earthly
[1:47:00] bride
[1:47:01] uniting together in the thoughts of God
[1:47:04] that they think is one
[1:47:06] act as one live as one do you believe
[1:47:10] that amen
[1:47:12] oh I am thinking of the rapture
[1:47:18] [Music]

[1:50:32] didn't Paul tell us he said if we didn't
[1:50:34] have this hope we'd be most miserable of
[1:50:37] all men but we're not miserable because
[1:50:40] this world can't hold us the grave can't
[1:50:43] hold our body down we are are going into
[1:50:46] Rapture and God's preparing you for it
[1:50:49] just think of it you could even have
[1:50:51] tried to run for it from it and he had
[1:50:54] reached out grabbed hold of you
[1:50:57] and started breaking you and molding you
[1:50:59] and he's going to get you no matter how
[1:51:03] bad the grip the enemy might have he'll
[1:51:06] peel that grip off and he'll set you
[1:51:09] free to take your vehicle anyway we know
[1:51:12] I believe brother Cosman and Andrew are
[1:51:16] leaving for a Tanzania tomorrow so uh we
[1:51:21] want to keep them in prayers they're
