[21:05] you good
[21:07] morning you know today is uh what
[21:10] traditional Christianity calls Palm
[21:15] Sunday it's
[21:17] uh the beginning of Jesus final
[21:21] week leading up into his death on Good
[21:26] Friday and his resurrection on Easter
[21:30] you know it's the beginning of a space
[21:32] of time that uh is referred to as the
[21:36] passion week or The Passion of Christ as
[21:41] you you know look out at the churches in
[21:44] the
[21:44] land you know there's certainly a lot of
[21:47] attention um this time of year in the
[21:51] church World you'll see lots of
[21:53] religious
[21:54] events lots of church activities you'll
[21:58] see signs advertising come celebrate
[22:01] Easter with us this
[22:04] Sunday
[22:05] perhaps
[22:08] confusing witnessing with
[22:11] advertising you all this
[22:13] attention and all this
[22:16] Zeal religious activities centered on
[22:19] this this week of the
[22:23] year all with all that celebration and
[22:26] all of those religious activities that
[22:28] we'll see throughout the next week or
[22:31] so it remains nothing more than another
[22:35] religious day to
[22:38] celebrate you know they may
[22:41] celebrate
[22:43] Resurrection but there's no newness of
[22:46] Life the Easter comes and Easter
[22:51] goes and the day after Easter is just
[22:54] like any other day in their lives
[22:59] but you know there is something being
[23:01] accomplished
[23:03] there that should have a permanent
[23:07] effect on a
[23:10] life you know during that final week the
[23:14] very night that Jesus was taken by the
[23:17] Jews he had all his disciples gathered
[23:20] there in in a room to celebrate the
[23:23] Passover and
[23:25] he he made this statement he said in
[23:27] John 14 in my father's house are many
[23:32] mansions if it were not so I would have
[23:35] told you I go to prepare a place for
[23:40] you and I and if I go and prepare a
[23:44] place for
[23:46] you I will come again and receive you
[23:50] unto
[23:51] myself that where I am there ye may be
[23:57] also
[23:59] you notice notice what he says one
[24:01] house but many
[24:05] mansions I go to prepare to make ready a
[24:10] place for
[24:12] you so how does he prepare that
[24:15] place he comes again and he receives you
[24:19] unto
[24:21] himself that you and him May dwell
[24:24] together in the same
[24:27] place then begins to make statements
[24:29] like this in verse 13 and whatsoever ye
[24:32] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[24:36] the father may be glorified in the
[24:38] son verse 16 I will pray the father and
[24:41] he shall give you another comforter that
[24:43] he may abide with you
[24:47] forever Verse 18 I will not leave you
[24:49] comfortless I will come to
[24:53] you verse 20 at that day ye shall know
[24:56] that I am in my father and ye in me and
[25:00] I in
[25:03] you I will come again and receive you
[25:06] unto myself that where I am there ye may
[25:10] be
[25:11] also you and him dwelling
[25:15] together in the same
[25:18] place one of the mansions in the
[25:22] house he says things like John 15:5 he
[25:25] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[25:29] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[25:32] ye can do
[25:34] nothing verse 7 if ye abide in me and my
[25:37] words abide in you ye shall ask what ye
[25:40] will and it shall be done unto
[25:43] you statement after statement describing
[25:47] the effect of
[25:51] Easter but instead for most it's just an
[25:55] annual religious event and all these
[25:57] things that Jesus said is for some
[26:01] future Heavenly
[26:04] event but never coming into newness of
[26:07] Life
[26:10] today we're going to read about that in
[26:12] Psalm 84 this morning you want to turn
[26:15] to
[26:16] that it's just a beautiful Psalm but
[26:19] it's a Psalm of someone who desires to
[26:23] be and dwells in this
[26:26] place this place
[26:29] that he's prepared for
[26:32] you it begins in verse one how amiable
[26:35] are thy
[26:36] Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul
[26:41] longth y even fainteth for the courts of
[26:44] the Lord you know just like John 14 he's
[26:47] not talking about some future Heavenly
[26:50] Dwelling
[26:51] Place he's talking about a place we can
[26:54] dwell
[26:57] now this is talking about those who
[27:00] dwell in that house behold I go to
[27:03] prepare a place for
[27:05] you see the effect of Easter is
[27:10] cohabitation newness of life that
[27:12] results in
[27:14] him and me dwelling in the same
[27:18] place I in him and him in
[27:24] me it says in verse four notice one one
[27:27] house but many t Tabernacles blessed are
[27:29] they that dwell present tense in thy
[27:33] house they will be still praising thee
[27:38] they will praise him while standing
[27:41] still goes on blessed is the man whose
[27:45] strength is in thee and whose heart are
[27:48] the ways of them blessed is he this
[27:51] Mansion this Tabernacle who has his
[27:56] strength who has has the ways of the
[27:59] Lord written in his
[28:02] heart just like David was a man after
[28:04] God's Own
[28:06] Heart those who have his strength those
[28:09] who have his desires his thoughts his
[28:13] word written in their hearts living
[28:16] Epistles read of all
[28:19] men goes on in verse six describing the
[28:23] same one I like this who passing through
[28:27] the valley of vaka make it a
[28:31] well the rain also filth the pools they
[28:35] go from strength to strength every one
[28:37] of them in Zion appear before God see
[28:41] the effect of one of these Mansions of
[28:45] one of these Tabernacles one of these
[28:48] cohabitants with the Lord there is an
[28:51] effect of their
[28:55] passing it's talking about someone who
[28:57] dwells in this his house that no matter
[28:59] how dry the situation is when he passes
[29:03] by he leaves behind life he leaves
[29:07] behind refreshing he leaves behind
[29:09] sources of water that they may
[29:12] drink this isn't just the effect of the
[29:15] presence of the Lord this is the effect
[29:18] of those who dwell in the presence of
[29:20] the Lord who passing through the valley
[29:23] of baka no matter how dry it is leaves
[29:27] something behind
[29:29] that others may have
[29:32] life being able to step into any
[29:35] circumstance any
[29:37] situation any Walk of Life and to bring
[29:41] refreshing to bring
[29:43] life to bring his presence his word
[29:49] written in our
[29:50] heart see Easter isn't just a
[29:53] celebration of a resurrection from a
[29:55] grave
[29:57] somewhere Easter is him cohabitating
[29:59] with
[30:01] me Easter is there being a lifegiving
[30:05] effect of his
[30:08] passing just as there's virtue in him
[30:12] there's virtue in me if he dwelleth in
[30:15] me and I in
[30:18] him let's stand this
[30:20] morning you know verse 10 of this Psalm
[30:23] says this for a day in thy
[30:26] courts is better than a
[30:29] thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in
[30:32] the house of God than to dwell in the
[30:35] tents of
[30:37] wickedness how many can say that is
[30:40] so you know as uh I was just reading
[30:44] that this morning
[30:46] the Easter should have an effect and it
[30:49] shouldn't matter whether it's the 40th
[30:51] day of Lent or the 280th day of the year
[30:55] or Tuesday or Easter
[30:58] Sunday there should be an effect of his
[31:01] passing there should be an effect of his
[31:03] resurrection let's go ahead and read
[31:05] Psalm 84 this morning how amiable are
[31:09] thy Tabernacles oh lord of hosts my soul
[31:12] longth y even ftth for the courts of the
[31:15] Lord my heart and my flesh crith out for
[31:18] the Living God yay the sparrow hath

[31:23] for herself where she may lay her young
[31:26] even thine altars oh lord of hosts my
[31:28] king and my God blessed are they that
[31:31] dwell in thy house they will be still
[31:34] praising thee CA blessed is the man
[31:37] whose strength is in thee in whose heart
[31:39] are the ways of them who passing through
[31:42] the valley of baka make it a well the
[31:44] rain also filth the pools they go from
[31:47] strength to strength every one of them

[31:53] hosts hear my prayer give ear oh god of
[31:56] Jacob CA hold oh God our shield and look

[32:02] day in thy courts is better than a
[32:04] thousand I had rather be a doorkeeper in
[32:07] the house of my God than to dwell in the
[32:09] tents of wickedness for the Lord God is
[32:11] a son and shield the Lord will give
[32:14] Grace and Glory no good thing will he

[56:47] jesus' name we pray amen and amen God
[56:51] bless you this morning welcome all our
[56:53] visitors and um everyone that that's
[56:56] here with us this morning let's open our
[56:59] Bibles to the gospel of uh John and
[57:05] um um we want to just read a a a couple
[57:12] verses here starting in the 10th verse
[57:16] through the 12th verse this morning and
[57:25] um
[57:32] so we read just a few verses
[57:36] here let's start with verse
[57:38] n he
[57:40] says that was the True Light which lith
[57:44] every man that cometh into the world for
[57:48] he was in the world and the world was
[57:52] made by him and the world knew him not
[57:58] he came unto his own and his own
[58:03] received him not but as many as received
[58:09] him to them gave he power to become the
[58:15] sons of God even to them that believed
[58:19] on his name which were born not of blood
[58:25] nor of of the will of the flesh nor of
[58:29] the will of man but of God Heavenly
[58:35] Father we ask you to bless us this
[58:37] morning in your precious name we pray
[58:40] amen God bless you may be seated this
[58:45] morning it's always good to be in the
[58:48] house of the Lord you know uh uh many
[58:53] times I I feel uh uh you know challenged
[58:57] in life I've always been a little
[58:59] challenged in life but uh uh the good
[59:02] part about it is I'm a fighter which
[59:05] isn't always the best thing you know but
[59:08] uh I I I'll I'll walk and I'll I you
[59:12] know and it just seems like things are
[59:14] bad and everything and then I'll walk
[59:16] into the church building and there just
[59:19] seems to be a piece and there just seems
[59:21] to be good you know or you just take
[59:24] your Bible and read it and all all of a
[59:26] sudden it this seems like the world goes
[59:30] away and all those to me are little
[59:32] glimpses that one day this world as we
[59:36] know it is going away not our Eternal
[59:42] existence I thought of uh a lot of uh
[59:46] people you know they they talk about the
[59:49] Fountain of Youth you know and they go
[59:52] find this Fountain and they drink and
[59:54] they live forever who and want to live
[59:56] forever here please tell me I mean uh it
[1:00:02] just uh I just I'm so glad that I have a
[1:00:07] hope of a land beyond the river right
[1:00:11] but while I'm here I want to be
[1:00:14] faithful and uh we just want to talk a
[1:00:17] little bit about that this morning maybe
[1:00:20] not something as deep uh as
[1:00:24] teaching or as as
[1:00:26] uh you might say uh
[1:00:29] Revelation but uh just something that uh
[1:00:34] uh I think it would be uh what the Lord
[1:00:38] is concerned about so how many believe
[1:00:42] the Lord looks down upon us a amen I
[1:00:46] mean you know God watches our lives uh
[1:00:49] you know uh the messenger told us in the
[1:00:52] church age book he says too many
[1:00:56] Christians or the the the main attitude
[1:01:01] of Christians is they think that God uh
[1:01:05] came down he gave us his word now he
[1:01:09] sits back with his arms folded and just
[1:01:12] watches you uh but that's not true uh
[1:01:16] God wants to be involved in our lives
[1:01:19] and he's involved in our uh our Affairs
[1:01:24] and I think we're all getting to be
[1:01:26] surprised at all the things that God did
[1:01:28] for us along the way that kept us you
[1:01:33] know just things that we thought were so
[1:01:36] discouraging and why it didn't happen
[1:01:39] and everything and yet we'll find out
[1:01:41] someday it was all for the good you know
[1:01:43] everything was perfectly on time
[1:01:46] everything was working out just right
[1:01:48] and uh it it it's a perfect thing that
[1:01:51] God always done but we sang a song here
[1:01:57] the other day and I I I kept trying to
[1:02:00] find it that song in my mind I I don't
[1:02:03] have much musical ability but I there
[1:02:06] was some uh verse in the song that said
[1:02:10] I want to be all that he wants me to be
[1:02:14] you know and and that really struck me
[1:02:17] and so I'm just going to preach a little
[1:02:19] maybe Evangelistic a little uh um
[1:02:23] teaching but uh but my thought is your
[1:02:29] spiritual
[1:02:30] career or your
[1:02:33] Christian
[1:02:35] career and uh you know we have a lot of
[1:02:38] uh people in school
[1:02:40] and lot of us uh have jobs and things
[1:02:45] and and we refer to those things a lot
[1:02:50] of times is a career or what we do for a
[1:02:53] living and the definition
[1:02:56] of a career is a
[1:03:00] profession and uh you know uh all these
[1:03:04] little words have significance you know
[1:03:08] you you profess to be in other words if
[1:03:12] I I I if I'm an attorney then we call it
[1:03:16] in the business world you hang your
[1:03:18] shingle up you you put a sign up that
[1:03:22] says I'm am a attorney or you might be
[1:03:26] an electrician and and you say I am
[1:03:30] electrician or I am a carpenter that's
[1:03:33] your profession you're professing what
[1:03:37] that you are you know I'm an
[1:03:40] entrepreneur you know or or or whatever
[1:03:43] that you are we have nurses and doctors
[1:03:46] and and and different professions uh you
[1:03:50] can label them any way that you want
[1:03:52] technicians whatever you have to say but
[1:03:55] it's something that you Pro
[1:03:58] proess that you do so you know that that
[1:04:03] that your profession you say I do this I
[1:04:07] do this this is what I do and it doesn't
[1:04:11] matter you know everybody uh relies on
[1:04:14] one another you you know somebody might
[1:04:17] be a grocer but the grocer is relying on
[1:04:20] the farmer and the farmer is relying on
[1:04:23] the truck driver and and and then the
[1:04:26] stores there and they're relying on
[1:04:28] people coming to
[1:04:29] buy and so it takes all of the pieces
[1:04:34] together to make it work to make a
[1:04:38] society to work to make an economy to
[1:04:41] work and uh and so everybody is uh makes
[1:04:47] a uh uh some sort of uh um profession of
[1:04:54] what that they do I know people that are
[1:04:57] a full-time
[1:04:59] student I have a cousin that's been in
[1:05:02] school for 50 years you know he writes
[1:05:05] grants and he takes classes and he goes
[1:05:08] to University and that's what he does
[1:05:10] you know and and the uh others are
[1:05:13] teachers so you understand that it's
[1:05:15] something that you say that you're doing
[1:05:18] I remember uh you know Billy Paul told
[1:05:21] me and I think it's on tape also but he
[1:05:24] said daddy told me if I was going to be
[1:05:26] a bum not to work one day in my
[1:05:30] life so if you're going to be a bum
[1:05:33] that's I'm I'm a bum then that's what
[1:05:36] you
[1:05:36] do you you know what I mean that that's
[1:05:39] what you do and then the other part of
[1:05:42] the definition it's an
[1:05:45] occupation and you know to occupy
[1:05:48] something uh in after the war uh we we
[1:05:52] would have what we called an
[1:05:54] occupational Force
[1:05:56] it was somebody there that that occupied
[1:05:59] they they stayed in the country so that
[1:06:02] the the enemy that they had overcome
[1:06:06] wouldn't rise back up again so it means
[1:06:09] to occupy means well when you occupy a
[1:06:13] home you are living in that home you're
[1:06:16] you're there that's what you do you're
[1:06:18] taking up that space and so a career is
[1:06:22] an occupation so that's what you do you
[1:06:26] occupy that that's what you do you're
[1:06:28] doing it every day you're preparing for
[1:06:31] it all the time it's an ongoing thing
[1:06:35] it's in occupation it's not a
[1:06:38] sometime you you you know what I mean
[1:06:41] you just don't you don't do it uh uh
[1:06:45] sometimes you know now I I I have to say
[1:06:50] nowadays That I Used to Be
[1:06:53] electrician because every time I get
[1:06:55] around around the young electricians
[1:06:57] they call me old school you know I let's
[1:07:01] do it this way we don't do that no more
[1:07:03] and they'll come up with some Gadget you
[1:07:06] you know what I mean that does something
[1:07:08] for you and I think I don't even trust
[1:07:12] it but oh it's the way to do it you know
[1:07:15] what I mean and and I so I just sit back
[1:07:18] and uh you know I used to um do
[1:07:23] Knockouts with a a a whole saw and a
[1:07:27] crescent wrench and so I got the
[1:07:29] knockout set yet and those guys looked
[1:07:31] at me like I'm crazy they got this
[1:07:34] little thing that they just put on there
[1:07:35] it's a it's run by a drill motor I go
[1:07:39] that's not even making that ain't
[1:07:41] electricians no more I said that's
[1:07:43] sissies you know you know I used to go
[1:07:47] home my hands were all cut up from being
[1:07:49] in the Box you know and and my twisting
[1:07:52] joints and and that's where you take the
[1:07:55] wires and you twist them you don't do
[1:07:57] that no more they got this little
[1:07:59] plastic thing you stick the wires
[1:08:04] in you know because it it Advanced you
[1:08:07] know what I mean but so you know an
[1:08:09] occupation means that's what you occupy
[1:08:12] see I don't occupy that anymore I don't
[1:08:16] occupy that space I don't occupy that
[1:08:19] thinking in other words I'm not in there
[1:08:22] I'm not doing that I'm not occup in that
[1:08:26] that my my presence isn't in that realm
[1:08:31] in that Dimension because my presence
[1:08:34] isn't in that realm and dimension and
[1:08:37] I'm not occupying it I haven't moved up
[1:08:40] with it right you understand and they
[1:08:43] passed me
[1:08:45] by and uh and so you you you understand
[1:08:49] that that's part of what a career is
[1:08:52] it's an occupation it's something that
[1:08:54] you OCC occupy how many have heard of
[1:08:57] continuing
[1:09:02] education I I I I guess I see heads
[1:09:05] naughty right you got to if you don't if
[1:09:08] you're going to be in a
[1:09:10] career it's mandatory you keep up with
[1:09:13] it you you know what I mean uh uh what
[1:09:18] would you do if you walked in and a
[1:09:20] doctor came in and you were sick and he
[1:09:22] says well I'm going to take two pints of
[1:09:24] blood out of you
[1:09:26] you say wait a minute they quit bleeding
[1:09:29] people two centuries
[1:09:33] ago but if you don't stay with it if
[1:09:36] you're not in it if you're not occupying
[1:09:40] it that's why it's called a what an
[1:09:43] occupation a profession it's something
[1:09:46] you keep up with it's something you're
[1:09:48] you're you're doing you're go you're
[1:09:50] you're in continuing
[1:09:53] education uh so so many things like we
[1:09:57] have some photographers here you you you
[1:10:00] want to know if if if I showed up with
[1:10:03] you know uh one of those Kodak insta
[1:10:07] cameras you know and was putting out
[1:10:09] pictures you know and I went to Sister
[1:10:12] Rebecca I said let's go let's go take
[1:10:14] some pictures you know what I mean and I
[1:10:16] pulled out my little thing and said
[1:10:18] isn't that a good picture you know and
[1:10:19] she'll she'll have four or five bags on
[1:10:21] her you know and one camera in front of
[1:10:24] her and one camera in her and you know
[1:10:26] what I
[1:10:27] mean and oh I got to wait a minute I got
[1:10:29] to get this lens out and set five or six
[1:10:32] seven lenses out here and then she you
[1:10:34] know you oh you got to get the lights
[1:10:36] just right you know what I mean they
[1:10:37] bought a sep a whole bunch of separate
[1:10:40] lights just so my
[1:10:45] face won't have any shadows in
[1:10:49] it you know what I mean so when I get
[1:10:52] over there in this building by the of
[1:10:55] God I've been promised that I'm going to
[1:10:57] look
[1:11:04] good they even have a special
[1:11:07] button that if I need a little more on
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:10] right and a little more on the left you
[1:11:13] know I mean because they they're they're
[1:11:17] photographers you know that's what they
[1:11:19] do they read books on it you know I I I
[1:11:23] remember I sat in the plane one day and
[1:11:25] I looked over that guy said you know
[1:11:28] someday they're going to make shoes for
[1:11:29] walking and they're going to write books
[1:11:32] about how to
[1:11:34] walk I made that in
[1:11:37] just and now they got it yeah you know
[1:11:40] everything everything but these are
[1:11:42] people who they're so involved and what
[1:11:47] they doing it's their
[1:11:49] career because by it they make a living
[1:11:54] so it it's a trade a vocation a vocation
[1:11:59] is is you know it so anyway it's it's
[1:12:02] what it's what they
[1:12:04] do for a living now with that definition
[1:12:08] in
[1:12:09] mind
[1:12:11] uh think
[1:12:13] about a
[1:12:15] Christian
[1:12:17] career or a Christian vocation a
[1:12:21] vocation is a is a strong uh substance
[1:12:26] and desire to
[1:12:30] participate in a certain field of
[1:12:34] endeavor another another words if I
[1:12:36] could use another word for it
[1:12:38] calling my vocations my calling this is
[1:12:42] It's a I have a desire to uh to
[1:12:46] participate in this field and so uh
[1:12:50] we're talking today just for a few
[1:12:51] moments this morning and I think it's
[1:12:54] probably the thing that's most
[1:12:57] neglected I will say in my life is my
[1:13:01] spiritual and Christian
[1:13:06] career okay now remember a career is
[1:13:09] something that you do to live
[1:13:12] by it doesn't matter what it is you you
[1:13:17] you know uh uh I I I asked a guy one
[1:13:21] time a friend of mine he used to collect
[1:13:24] uh trash we'd call him a garbage man and
[1:13:28] he informed me right away that he wasn't
[1:13:31] a garbage man he was a sanitary
[1:13:36] engineer so I thought that's pretty good
[1:13:39] isn't it so you paint it any way you
[1:13:41] want to paint it right okay you've given
[1:13:45] yourself to
[1:13:47] something that's going to help you
[1:13:50] survive and make a
[1:13:54] living and too many
[1:13:58] times our other
[1:14:02] career gets left behind so that's what
[1:14:05] we just want to visit with you this
[1:14:07] morning and I I feel this way for
[1:14:11] reason okay is I believe that God
[1:14:14] doesn't look at us Through The Eyes of
[1:14:18] man you understand he looks at us
[1:14:24] through the
[1:14:26] eyes of what he saw in us before we got
[1:14:34] here you understand so God sees
[1:14:37] something different in you than you even
[1:14:41] see in yourself right and and that's one
[1:14:45] of the great things that we have to
[1:14:47] battle is our self-esteem or our our
[1:14:52] self analysis or what that we feel
[1:14:55] about
[1:14:57] ourselves but so I just wanted to go
[1:15:00] through a few points this morning with
[1:15:03] you at to establish with you in each of
[1:15:10] you have a Christian
[1:15:14] career right you understand you have a
[1:15:18] spiritual career whether or
[1:15:23] not uh you're active in it is a
[1:15:27] different thing but we just want to ask
[1:15:30] ourselves is there
[1:15:32] something that's within us is there
[1:15:36] something that we have that is
[1:15:40] pursuable and
[1:15:44] obtainable and it to obtain uh a
[1:15:49] career uh that it or a trade it's
[1:15:54] something
[1:15:55] that takes uh some sort of
[1:15:59] training and effort and accumulation of
[1:16:04] knowledge and understanding uh before
[1:16:07] you make a profession that you are
[1:16:10] something you better know how to do
[1:16:13] it you you uh uh um I ran a a a painting
[1:16:20] business for several years and I would
[1:16:23] have people that would come in to me and
[1:16:25] they say that they were a
[1:16:27] painter uh you know and you know 10
[1:16:31] gallons of paint remover and 500 sheets
[1:16:33] of sandpaper later I fixed what they
[1:16:37] thought that they were doing when they
[1:16:39] were painting you know they weren't
[1:16:41] painters you know what I mean they they
[1:16:43] they had no training they had no
[1:16:45] background they had no understanding you
[1:16:47] know they probably watched one of those
[1:16:50] YouTube videos where a girl all dressed
[1:16:53] in a helmet and goggles and little tool
[1:16:56] belt that never looks like it's been
[1:16:57] used before and and you know she and she
[1:17:01] goes and fixes something and 10 minutes
[1:17:04] you know it took them two weeks to make
[1:17:06] the show and but that's not
[1:17:09] reality you know in other words if
[1:17:11] you've accomplished
[1:17:14] something to to say that you're a
[1:17:17] teacher or or or or you profess a trade
[1:17:22] you put some time into it you learned
[1:17:25] something you made some mistakes you you
[1:17:28] you you worked your way to that point
[1:17:31] you had to have somebody Mentor you
[1:17:34] teach you pass knowledge on to you
[1:17:39] uh uh brother J could you imagine
[1:17:42] somebody learning electricity the hard
[1:17:44] way you
[1:17:46] know oh the black wire makes you
[1:17:50] wiggle and so you go around then you
[1:17:52] grab the red wire oh the the red wire
[1:17:55] makes you wiggle well don't touch the
[1:17:58] yellow or the orange or the
[1:18:01] brown cuz that's designed for higher
[1:18:04] voltage that'll really make you shake
[1:18:07] you know what I mean we don't learn
[1:18:09] things we
[1:18:10] learn you understand that our mothers
[1:18:14] and our fathers were our first
[1:18:16] teachers they helped us take our first
[1:18:19] step they they taught us what to eat
[1:18:22] they taught us how to do things you know
[1:18:24] what I mean mean so we've always been
[1:18:26] trained all our life you even had to be
[1:18:29] trained to
[1:18:31] live so we we so let's just uh take a
[1:18:35] few moments this morning because I want
[1:18:39] you as we preach this morning or
[1:18:42] Minister talk with
[1:18:44] you God's looking at you and he gave you
[1:18:47] a career in
[1:18:50] Christ he gave you he placed Within you
[1:18:55] he he he he he made you and so we
[1:19:01] understand that and so uh so we in
[1:19:05] preaching the gospel over the last few
[1:19:08] weeks and everything we we we talked you
[1:19:10] about the law of the seed we've been
[1:19:13] talking about the law of the seed and
[1:19:16] last week I know I made some statements
[1:19:18] and I I thought that I might get a
[1:19:20] little um uh uh feed uh feedback on it
[1:19:26] but you know I and I hope that you take
[1:19:30] it the way that I meant it but I said
[1:19:33] that you know you can't be
[1:19:36] Jesus right you you you understand you
[1:19:40] can't be him you've got to be what you
[1:19:45] are and you were in God's thinking in
[1:19:48] the beginning how many we know that
[1:19:50] we've established that we we've went
[1:19:53] through that and so that's what we said
[1:19:56] that when that which is perfect is come
[1:20:00] when when all the gifts and things are
[1:20:02] done away with in part because
[1:20:06] prophecies will
[1:20:08] fail right tongues will cease but
[1:20:12] there's one thing that won't cease and
[1:20:15] that's what God had in his
[1:20:18] mind right and what is a word a word is
[1:20:22] a thought expressed amen and uh and that
[1:20:27] word was with God and that word was made
[1:20:31] flesh and the scripture said he made the
[1:20:34] world and the world knew him not and so
[1:20:38] the very creator of Heaven and Earth the
[1:20:41] thoughts of God were were came down and
[1:20:44] they were
[1:20:45] manifested and so we've established that
[1:20:49] there are there are
[1:20:53] uh that there
[1:20:55] that that there's a spiritual man and a
[1:20:57] carnal
[1:20:59] man so how we're looking at yourself
[1:21:03] right you're an outside man a spirit man
[1:21:06] and you're a spiritual man you have your
[1:21:09] personality if I could say that which is
[1:21:13] spiritual which is uh a a nature and
[1:21:17] then your nature is in the form of the
[1:21:20] outside person that you are and and I'm
[1:21:25] a firm believer that beauty is in the
[1:21:28] eyes of the
[1:21:29] beholder you you understand you you
[1:21:32] might look upon a person and and you
[1:21:35] might not think that they're very
[1:21:37] handsome or very attractive but you know
[1:21:39] there's somebody else out there that's
[1:21:43] just
[1:21:45] oh you know I I I mean I'm glad lesie
[1:21:49] felt that way else I wouldn't had I
[1:21:51] wouldn't have had a chance yeah yeah you
[1:21:54] know what I mean uh uh of course a guy
[1:21:57] asked me one time what spell I put on
[1:21:59] her he heard that I was The Wizard so he
[1:22:02] thought I Put a Spell on her you know no
[1:22:05] I just think that was the grace of God
[1:22:07] but you know so you you can't compare
[1:22:10] yourselves one with another this the
[1:22:12] scripture says that it you're a fool
[1:22:15] when you compare yourselves one with
[1:22:18] another and and we're we're we're warned
[1:22:21] and we're trained that don't don't
[1:22:24] choose somebody according to their looks
[1:22:27] alone you know what I mean because they
[1:22:29] will fade you you know what I mean could
[1:22:32] you imagine when I walked up to lesie
[1:22:35] and I met her when I was uh 20 years old
[1:22:38] or whenever it was and this is she
[1:22:41] looked down the road and saw this and
[1:22:44] and you know as as this went away this
[1:22:47] became bigger and and she would have
[1:22:51] looked at that she she said oh my
[1:22:53] goodness
[1:22:55] you know what I mean no you don't you
[1:22:57] better find something that endures
[1:23:00] character grows character gets more
[1:23:03] beautiful as time goes on character gets
[1:23:07] stronger virtues get more have more
[1:23:09] strength you know what I mean so we
[1:23:12] don't measure but but we have a we have
[1:23:15] a carnal man the outside that the sensus
[1:23:19] the things that we've we've established
[1:23:21] all that stuff those things but I don't
[1:23:23] think that we're taking the
[1:23:25] training and the
[1:23:27] establishing and the teaching and using
[1:23:31] it for our career oh
[1:23:34] my God isn't teaching you these things
[1:23:37] for you to sit there and for me to sit
[1:23:40] here and be be what we would call
[1:23:44] spiritual no that is not spiritual that
[1:23:48] is
[1:23:52] theology right you know
[1:23:55] know that that's that's theology right
[1:23:59] if you just to gain knowledge doesn't uh
[1:24:03] doesn't do anything what does knowledge
[1:24:05] do how many know what the scripture says
[1:24:07] knowledge does knowledge puffeth
[1:24:13] up it may you you know what something
[1:24:16] that's puffed up is somebody that thinks
[1:24:19] they're more than they really
[1:24:21] are they're all puffed up right yeah you
[1:24:25] know what I mean you know insects and
[1:24:28] lizards and stuff they could they
[1:24:30] they'll Puffs out they're trying to
[1:24:34] appear to be something that they're not
[1:24:36] it's like a protective
[1:24:39] mechanism yeah you know what I mean uh
[1:24:42] uh uh it's like a a guy told me you know
[1:24:45] a guy applied for a a a a job as a
[1:24:50] carpenter and he walked in there and he
[1:24:53] he he he he said uh uh he says oh you're
[1:24:56] a carpenter he says let me see your
[1:24:58] Hammer you know and the guy pulled out
[1:25:00] his hammer and he threw his hammer up
[1:25:02] and twirled it around and caught it and
[1:25:04] everything he says Ah he says I got a
[1:25:06] bunch of a hammer twirlers I need a
[1:25:11] carpenter you know and so that's just
[1:25:15] theology believe me as as as your friend
[1:25:21] and and fellow
[1:25:23] laborer our knowledge does not impress
[1:25:29] God what we know doesn't impress
[1:25:35] him to know what he knows you would have
[1:25:38] to be him and he's trying to get us
[1:25:42] there that's right so we have the
[1:25:45] outside man and we have uh uh the uh we
[1:25:50] have the spiritual mind and we have the
[1:25:54] carnal
[1:25:55] mind we have this we have the spiritual
[1:25:59] man or the Inner Man and the outer man
[1:26:04] so we we have these these these things
[1:26:07] that we are now our our nature is to
[1:26:13] attend to the flesh to the outside guide
[1:26:18] keep them warm keep them comfortable
[1:26:20] keep them fed try to keep them healthy
[1:26:24] uh to take care of them we labor in
[1:26:27] taking care of our
[1:26:29] flesh the our flesh has the preeminence
[1:26:33] in our lives uh that's our survival
[1:26:38] Instinct you you understand but the
[1:26:41] spiritual uh inner man he seems to go uh
[1:26:47] more neglected than anything but did you
[1:26:51] know a a strong in inner man has more
[1:26:56] capability of taking care of the outer
[1:26:59] man than somebody with a weak Inner
[1:27:03] Man and we won't go into all all that
[1:27:06] this morning but it it's things that you
[1:27:10] find out over time if you have a good
[1:27:13] moral substance and you have good moral
[1:27:16] character it it keeps you out of places
[1:27:19] that do harm to the outer man but a weak
[1:27:23] in inner man will cause the fleshly man
[1:27:27] or the outer man to get into places that
[1:27:30] do him
[1:27:33] harm because we have these two
[1:27:36] beings that we are we're the outer man
[1:27:40] we have the spiritual mind the carnal
[1:27:42] mind and the carnal mind is what it's a
[1:27:45] enity with
[1:27:47] God and know it doesn't fit into what
[1:27:51] God has in mind right yeah so the carnal
[1:27:55] pursues carnal right right the carnal
[1:27:59] things are after the carnal things of
[1:28:01] the world but the spiritual mind seeketh
[1:28:05] after the things of
[1:28:08] God now if God has a
[1:28:11] career for you this morning a spiritual
[1:28:16] career or a Christian career my my my
[1:28:21] whole theme this morning is is what are
[1:28:24] we doing to pursue
[1:28:32] that your
[1:28:35] vocation your
[1:28:37] calling your
[1:28:42] gift you know that that's a question
[1:28:46] because God has
[1:28:49] been actually sent a
[1:28:52] messenger to try to make us aware of the
[1:28:57] fact
[1:28:58] amen okay that we have life in us and we
[1:29:03] we have a a a calling in us and we have
[1:29:08] a seed in us and that he had something
[1:29:12] in mind when he put us
[1:29:15] here in fact he predestinated the
[1:29:19] believer to every age to prove his word
[1:29:24] now we're not here I don't want you to
[1:29:27] be here I don't want the young people to
[1:29:28] be here because mama and daddy makes you
[1:29:31] and you're you're trying to keep the
[1:29:34] peace at home now that's smart I commend
[1:29:38] that but and I would do the same I mean
[1:29:43] that was one rule me and lesli had that
[1:29:45] the kids had to be in church on
[1:29:47] Sunday well we couldn't control every
[1:29:50] aspect of their life so they'd sit in
[1:29:52] church on Sunday
[1:29:56] you know just dreading it you understand
[1:30:00] so I but I Knew by the promise of God's
[1:30:03] word that if they if I made them sit on
[1:30:06] the back one day they'd make it to the
[1:30:10] front
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:15] Hallelujah right so so so we we know
[1:30:20] know those things but you know don't get
[1:30:24] so carnal minded that you can't get some
[1:30:28] value on right out of being forced to be
[1:30:36] here you know I've went places that you
[1:30:39] know they wanted me to go well we're all
[1:30:41] going to go do this
[1:30:43] and go down and I drag myself along and
[1:30:48] force myself to go in there and act and
[1:30:52] feel bad all the time sit there you know
[1:30:55] and after a while you
[1:30:57] know it got to be pretty good and I was
[1:31:01] enjoying
[1:31:02] myself you know and uh uh and after a
[1:31:06] while you know I of course I walk I said
[1:31:08] well it's all
[1:31:10] right you know maybe I'm you know but I
[1:31:13] enjoyed myself because I sat through it
[1:31:16] so just don't don't come and shut off
[1:31:19] the opportunity to gain a lot of
[1:31:22] knowledge and a lot of wisdom and a lot
[1:31:25] of things that can help you down life's
[1:31:28] Road you know I trust this morning even
[1:31:32] though I'm a man in flesh with all my
[1:31:34] shortcomings but as long as we stay
[1:31:37] within this word this word is what will
[1:31:40] bless
[1:31:42] you it'll do something positive for you
[1:31:46] so we we have the inner man we have the
[1:31:48] outer man now we we want to remember
[1:31:52] this this morning
[1:31:55] cuz we're talking about your Christian
[1:32:00] career another words God has given
[1:32:05] you a
[1:32:07] career in Christianity
[1:32:12] right he's giving you a a career in
[1:32:16] Christianity a spiritual
[1:32:19] career in other words it's an
[1:32:22] Endeavor and occupation something that
[1:32:25] you do
[1:32:28] spiritually a
[1:32:30] vocation a gift a
[1:32:34] calling something that you do for the
[1:32:37] kingdom of God some people they we talk
[1:32:40] they they have a musical gift or they
[1:32:43] they have a gift I could I didn't want
[1:32:45] to take the time this morning to go into
[1:32:48] it and said that the spirit of God's the
[1:32:50] part of gifts some have helps so some
[1:32:53] have different gifts some different
[1:32:55] callings different things that you do
[1:32:57] for the
[1:32:59] kingdom I I I I would say behooves
[1:33:03] us to ask ourselves what does God want
[1:33:07] me to do for his
[1:33:12] kingdom the body right the scripture
[1:33:16] tells us we've been going through all
[1:33:19] this Christian education for what come
[1:33:21] on come on a hope
[1:33:25] that we get up there and we
[1:33:27] hope that we did enough good things to
[1:33:30] make it that we
[1:33:33] hope we get in that we hope we don't go
[1:33:38] to
[1:33:42] hell I I just think that God didn't go
[1:33:45] through all the
[1:33:46] trouble of bringing each of you to the
[1:33:52] revelation of Mal
[1:33:55] 45 something that is absolutely a
[1:33:59] reproach to the Christian
[1:34:03] world to make you
[1:34:07] oddballs as far as your religious belief
[1:34:11] is as far as the way our sisters dress
[1:34:16] our brothers act he didn't do all that
[1:34:20] to have you sit down here on this Earth
[1:34:22] with the hopes of so right amen this
[1:34:26] isn't The Wizard of
[1:34:28] Oz
[1:34:30] someday Over the
[1:34:33] Rainbow you know with a
[1:34:37] someday or a
[1:34:41] hope you
[1:34:44] understand I
[1:34:47] hope I want to go beyond that I know for
[1:34:51] a fact that God's Got something planned
[1:34:55] for each and every single one of us and
[1:34:58] nobody can take your
[1:35:03] place something that you
[1:35:08] uniquely
[1:35:12] possess some place for you to
[1:35:17] occupy a profession that you can
[1:35:20] make something that that is is a
[1:35:25] vocation a
[1:35:27] calling a a desire in Your Heart Right
[1:35:32] it might be to feed the
[1:35:35] poor it might be to visit the the the
[1:35:39] father fatherless and the widows in
[1:35:42] their
[1:35:43] Affliction where have that where's so
[1:35:45] those things gone
[1:35:47] to they're still in the
[1:35:51] word they're absolutely the pattern of
[1:35:55] the early
[1:35:58] church Paul telling Timothy lay for
[1:36:01] yourself a pattern of good works let no
[1:36:04] man despise your youth stir up the gift
[1:36:08] that was in you you know from your
[1:36:15] grandmother but we've quit pursuing
[1:36:20] that it hasn't our our our carnal
[1:36:26] career and our carnal
[1:36:29] Minds have totally
[1:36:32] Gras everything that it
[1:36:36] takes to pursue a Earthly
[1:36:45] career if you want to be good at
[1:36:48] something what do you have to
[1:36:51] do got to practice
[1:36:55] that's right a lot of guys have natural
[1:37:00] ability but they don't make it to the
[1:37:02] top of their game so to speak because
[1:37:06] they don't work on the fundamentals they
[1:37:09] don't work on the cabin they don't lay
[1:37:12] for themsel the pattern they don't
[1:37:14] participate they don't do continual
[1:37:18] education they have no desire or nor no
[1:37:22] fortitude
[1:37:24] ude to reach a higher
[1:37:30] height so we we've got to sit back this
[1:37:35] morning and and and take a good look at
[1:37:40] ourselves so like I said we're not
[1:37:43] trying to just
[1:37:46] imitate the Lord Jesus that's an
[1:37:48] imitation right but we want in US
[1:37:54] what God placed in us from the
[1:37:58] beginning we want that to come to full
[1:38:01] maturity so we can be working and
[1:38:05] established in the spiritual career that
[1:38:09] he had intended us to do now religion
[1:38:14] came along and said I'll just wrap you
[1:38:17] in a covering some religious outward uh
[1:38:21] thing that lets everybody think that
[1:38:23] you're going to
[1:38:26] heaven that's
[1:38:28] right
[1:38:31] well you know I I want more than that I
[1:38:35] want to be all that I can
[1:38:40] be I don't want no pretense I want to be
[1:38:44] all that I can be so I know that certain
[1:38:48] things that we establish is we we we we
[1:38:52] establish that God determined to do
[1:38:57] everything by seed
[1:38:59] yes yes sir you understand that it's the
[1:39:02] law of the seed God chose the method of
[1:39:07] the seed to bring forth
[1:39:11] creation the first seed was the word
[1:39:15] seed Let There Be he said let there be
[1:39:19] and there was and then he separated the
[1:39:23] land and and and then he said let every
[1:39:26] seed bring forth of its kind so God
[1:39:30] chose
[1:39:32] seed we're all here because of
[1:39:37] seed the method that God chose for
[1:39:41] animals to procreate for humans to
[1:39:44] procreate all all those things it was
[1:39:46] done for Plant World they all have their
[1:39:48] law but it all comes down to seed right
[1:39:53] so there's a law in the seed so even
[1:39:57] your spiritual
[1:40:00] career is in you in seed
[1:40:04] form amen now because you're in the

[1:41:13] minded naturally the flesh man was
[1:41:17] already designed because of the fall in
[1:41:20] the garden to pursue
[1:41:23] a
[1:41:25] carnal
[1:41:30] career okay so you we didn't even

[1:41:59] spiritual calling a spiritual
[1:42:02] vocation something that God saw in the
[1:42:06] beginning and he placed within you but
[1:42:10] Satan's whole program is to get you to
[1:42:14] neglect that career that's the career
[1:42:18] that he doesn't want you to become good

[1:43:32] got we're just
[1:43:34] carnal beings and we just got a carnal
[1:43:37] mind and we're going to struggle is that
[1:43:40] what God
[1:43:42] planted I can't believe that you know
[1:43:45] what he planted he planted Sons and
[1:43:50] Daughters he planted careers
[1:43:56] H callings vocations right
[1:44:01] works that's what he
[1:44:04] planted so it's in it's in
[1:44:08] you it's in you let me hurry
[1:44:11] along if you get sore get up walk
[1:44:15] around so we just go so the seed the
[1:44:19] seed is in you so let's just read these
[1:44:21] couple this is paragraph 64 of God's
[1:44:25] power to
[1:44:27] transform he says and every things under
[1:44:32] control to bring forth of its
[1:44:37] kind right now remember to
[1:44:41] bring so it's in
[1:44:44] you you are the Earth that the seed of
[1:44:48] God is planted
[1:44:50] in when he put the seed
[1:44:53] seed in the
[1:44:55] Earth the seed can only come forth with
[1:44:59] the power of life within it
[1:45:04] right all right it can only come forth
[1:45:07] with the power of life in it every
[1:45:10] career that man has pursued he's had the
[1:45:14] ability to do
[1:45:16] it because the power was in his flesh to
[1:45:20] do
[1:45:21] it is that simple enough I I I I just
[1:45:26] want it to be
[1:45:32] simple and to and he said within it to
[1:45:36] transform from seed to a plant or
[1:45:40] whatever it
[1:45:42] was so the career that's in you
[1:45:45] spiritually has got to transform from
[1:45:49] seed to what that it is amen now we've
[1:45:53] established over and over and over again
[1:45:55] we're seed we're the seed of God we're
[1:45:57] the word of God we're in the mind of God
[1:45:59] how we've got that do we have that yet
[1:46:03] does everybody know your name's written
[1:46:05] on the Lamb's Book of Life is that
[1:46:07] settled you're the seat of God you're
[1:46:09] the children of
[1:46:11] God for
[1:46:15] what for what
[1:46:17] career for what calling for what
[1:46:21] purpose the powers within
[1:46:26] you but it's not
[1:46:29] pursued it's not sought after
[1:46:34] right he
[1:46:37] said to whatever is his transforming
[1:46:41] power now God put the seed in there with
[1:46:44] potential that it would be what he said
[1:46:47] it would
[1:46:49] be so you've got the potential m in you
[1:46:55] to fulfill your Christian
[1:47:00] career do do you all understand you've
[1:47:02] got a career you got a calling you got
[1:47:06] gifts you've got things that you are
[1:47:09] that he made you and as long as it stays
[1:47:14] in its right
[1:47:16] category it would be just exactly what
[1:47:19] God said it would be it had to be that
[1:47:23] way cuz he made it that way so the
[1:47:28] program's already there he made it that
[1:47:31] way the only reason men pursue carnal
[1:47:34] careers is because that's the law of
[1:47:38] God right he made it that way right all
[1:47:42] satan did is took what God did in the
[1:47:44] spiritual realm perverted it in the
[1:47:47] fleshly realm and's got everybody
[1:47:49] working for his kingdom instead of the
[1:47:52] kingdom of God
[1:47:53] I want to stop and say
[1:47:58] okay I have to work I'm in this world
[1:48:02] but I'm not of this world my career is
[1:48:05] not to have a statue down at McGary
[1:48:09] square and everybody go down there and
[1:48:11] say oh there's
[1:48:15] McGary you're just as dead as that
[1:48:18] statue
[1:48:20] is it's history right
[1:48:23] so I can go see the George Washington
[1:48:26] Monument great big pencil sitting up in
[1:48:29] the
[1:48:29] air I never me George
[1:48:33] right no I believe all the lies they
[1:48:36] tell about him you know he never told a
[1:48:39] lie and or was that a blinkin I can't
[1:48:42] even keep all the lies straight and he
[1:48:45] chopped down a cherry tree and he threw
[1:48:47] a dollar across the Delaware and all
[1:48:50] these things you know and and then when
[1:48:52] they really gave after him he was a
[1:48:53] slave owner and he's all this stuff and
[1:48:55] they want to tear his Monument down and
[1:48:58] you can't fix the past right forget
[1:49:01] about the past yes sir how about
[1:49:03] pursuing your Christian
[1:49:06] career how about pursuing Christianity
[1:49:09] how about pursuing what it means to be a
[1:49:11] Christian to lay for yourself a pattern
[1:49:14] of good work to go the extra mile to go
[1:49:17] Twain to
[1:49:20] give Nobody Does that in anymore because
[1:49:23] they're under the
[1:49:25] deception that the message gets you to
[1:49:28] heaven the message does not get you to
[1:49:31] heaven the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[1:49:34] what gets you to heaven the message was
[1:49:37] a word from God to get you in contact
[1:49:41] with your
[1:49:45] career let's finish reading real quick
[1:49:48] we'll close he
[1:49:50] said he made it that way and made a
[1:49:56] channel he made a
[1:50:01] channel he made a
[1:50:04] channel Satan made a channel for you to
[1:50:07] pursue your carnal
[1:50:09] career school education
[1:50:13] training inter
[1:50:16] internship
[1:50:18] practice on the job training whatever he
[1:50:22] made a
[1:50:25] channel are we aware this morning of the
[1:50:31] channel of our spiritual
[1:50:35] career have we pursued that channel have
[1:50:39] we found that channel now I know I'm
[1:50:41] being honest with you this morning
[1:50:44] because God's looking down and seeing
[1:50:47] all this
[1:50:48] potential that's hung up in the world
[1:50:51] come on
[1:50:53] and has now become afraid of the
[1:50:56] world we have a
[1:50:59] promise the righteous will not beg
[1:51:05] bread that settles
[1:51:09] it you want to live a long life what do
[1:51:12] you do you honor your father and
[1:51:16] mother you don't honor your father and
[1:51:20] mother long life is not your
[1:51:28] gift he made it that way be made a
[1:51:34] channel a a
[1:51:36] Pursuit a
[1:51:38] way a way to get there am a way to
[1:51:42] accomplish
[1:51:44] it okay so your spiritual career has got
[1:51:48] to grow in you first of all you're never
[1:51:51] going to pursue it if you don't want
[1:51:54] it if you're content in being an
[1:51:57] intellectual Christian if you're content
[1:52:00] in just believing the doctrine having
[1:52:03] the hope that you've believed the right
[1:52:05] thing you're part of the right group
[1:52:08] you're hanging around in the right spot
[1:52:11] therefore you're going to make
[1:52:15] it and that's good but I'm hoping that
[1:52:19] there's somebody here that says I want
[1:52:21] to be all that I can be
[1:52:23] I want to be what he made me I want to
[1:52:25] be able to play a part in the body I
[1:52:29] want to be able to do things that are
[1:52:31] that are are for the
[1:52:34] kingdom I want to I want Christ to live
[1:52:37] in me I want to and I I can't be him but
[1:52:41] his Spirit can be in me
[1:52:50] yes J
[1:52:53] in his line of word anything that stays
[1:52:57] in his channel in the line of in the
[1:53:02] line of word it will have to bring forth
[1:53:06] exactly like the word said it would do
[1:53:09] it cannot move from there it's channeled
[1:53:13] just exactly
[1:53:16] right so God knew what he doing whatever
[1:53:19] career he put in you he's got to channel
[1:53:23] right it's got a way to come alive and
[1:53:26] it's got to be what it is that's why
[1:53:28] there's no big eyes and little use it's
[1:53:31] just people that do all that the father
[1:53:34] tells them to
[1:53:39] do so with everything in in the trust of
[1:53:43] his own
[1:53:44] son that it would be that way God said
[1:53:48] it is all good so I'll just rest and
[1:53:51] each one of those seeds has the power in
[1:53:54] itself to transform itself into the
[1:53:58] species that I desired it to be what did
[1:54:02] he desire you to
[1:54:05] be Sons and Daughters of
[1:54:13] God
[1:54:15] really don't look at the
[1:54:20] mirror sin designed that
[1:54:24] guy the c Christian career was designed
[1:54:27] by
[1:54:30] God and he
[1:54:33] says that's what it must be because I've
[1:54:36] given every seed transforming power to
[1:54:40] make out
[1:54:42] of it
[1:54:45] self in its potential now to make out of
[1:54:50] itself exactly what I want it to
[1:54:57] be
[1:54:59] amen yeah I'll just read one more just
[1:55:02] to good what does the seed do look at
[1:55:06] the little little apple tree out here
[1:55:09] you people raise a lot of apples look at
[1:55:12] the little apple tree when it's no more
[1:55:16] than what we call in the East a sprig a
[1:55:19] little tree about about
[1:55:22] that did you know that every
[1:55:27] Apple will ever be on that tree is in it
[1:55:33] right
[1:55:35] then if it isn't where did it come from
[1:55:39] where did it come from what that apple
[1:55:43] tree that's going to produce hundreds of
[1:55:47] bushels of apples where do they come
[1:55:50] from they come from the life of the
[1:55:54] apple tree from that one little seed
[1:55:58] that carried that life and when you set
[1:56:01] that little plan out about like that
[1:56:05] about like
[1:56:07] that just out of a single apple seed and
[1:56:11] set it out there and every Apple that'll
[1:56:15] ever be on there has got in it then
[1:56:20] potential every hund bushels of apples
[1:56:23] that you will collect off of it it ain't
[1:56:26] a half an inch high amen there you are
[1:56:31] where does it come from it's in the
[1:56:35] Apple
[1:56:38] then what do you what is it I'm trying
[1:56:41] to tell you your career your spiritual
[1:56:45] career is in
[1:56:47] you amen it was in you when you were
[1:56:50] born right you came up all through the
[1:56:53] carnality you came up all through
[1:56:56] education but
[1:56:58] now now it's time
[1:57:02] amen and I'll say it like this and I I
[1:57:05] don't mean to be offensive but not to
[1:57:08] pursue gifts but to pursue careers amen
[1:57:12] good very good amen gifts may be there
[1:57:16] to help you along your
[1:57:20] career amen but
[1:57:24] individually as I tried to say last
[1:57:27] week it's not pursuing what he
[1:57:33] was it's
[1:57:36] pursuing the fact that he opened up for
[1:57:40] you by taking sin and by sending his
[1:57:44] Spirit he opened up to you the ability
[1:57:49] now for you to pursue
[1:57:52] your Christian career being a
[1:57:56] genuine living Son of God whose name is
[1:58:01] written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:58:06] Life he
[1:58:08] says and when you are planted in his
[1:58:11] death burial and Resurrection planted in
[1:58:14] Christ and receive his holy spirit life
[1:58:18] in you everything that you got need of
[1:58:21] all the way through the Journey is in
[1:58:25] you in you right then it's got to be
[1:58:30] what
[1:58:32] harvested and so in closing let's just
[1:58:36] take a
[1:58:37] quick
[1:58:39] look it said so Jesus had a
[1:58:44] purpose and he had a Cause right Jesus
[1:58:48] had a reason for being right
[1:58:54] do you believe
[1:58:56] that God came
[1:58:59] down and by seed created in
[1:59:04] Mary brother Ram said both German egg he
[1:59:08] created in Mary and Jesus was born into
[1:59:12] the world with a cause for this reason I
[1:59:17] have come into the world he had a
[1:59:21] purpose
[1:59:22] right Satan offered him a different
[1:59:28] career he knew that he had a reason he
[1:59:32] knew he was a Kinsman and he knew in
[1:59:35] order for every son and daughter of God
[1:59:38] to find their spiritual career to find
[1:59:42] their spiritual purpose to find the
[1:59:44] gifts and the callings that were within
[1:59:47] their lives he had to go to Calvary and
[1:59:51] pay the price for
[1:59:56] sin and he did that that's
[2:00:02] done now Satan's going to tell you that
[2:00:04] every day of your life you can't be a
[2:00:07] Christian guess what he don't want you
[2:00:09] to be a
[2:00:13] Christian Satan loves you so much he
[2:00:17] wants you to burn in hell with
[2:00:20] him now that's a love
[2:00:23] story I just want to be a part of that
[2:00:26] oh Satan take me to Hell burn I want to
[2:00:29] burn until I'm burn
[2:00:33] up really come
[2:00:37] on and will
[2:00:39] neglect so great a
[2:00:42] Salvation your career is your salvation
[2:00:50] yes
[2:00:53] so what did he come for he had a reason
[2:00:55] for living one to show The Father's
[2:01:00] Love
[2:01:02] right to show man and God could be in
[2:01:07] Fellowship they could have a union you
[2:01:10] can Fellowship God you can have a career
[2:01:13] with
[2:01:14] God Jesus's career was what I only do
[2:01:18] that which the father shows me
[2:01:24] it's not I that does the work it's the
[2:01:26] father in me that does the
[2:01:32] work that's what his Pursuit
[2:01:35] was that's what his profession was
[2:01:38] that's what his occupation was that's
[2:01:41] what his training was you think he had
[2:01:43] training he learned obedience by what
[2:01:46] the things he suffered
[2:01:50] amen
[2:01:53] it's beautiful love
[2:01:55] story he
[2:01:57] says and then when also did he want to
[2:02:00] show us that you could do the same works
[2:02:03] that he did right
[2:02:06] John John 1 and2 he gave him power to be
[2:02:10] the Sons and Daughters of God so what
[2:02:12] did he do a channel he gave us a channel
[2:02:17] God gave us his spirit and word so that
[2:02:20] the seed man has something to bring him
[2:02:24] to
[2:02:26] maturity he didn't give you the holy
[2:02:29] spirit for
[2:02:32] sensation I got a powerful quote on
[2:02:38] that he said God didn't make you so you
[2:02:41] could be like
[2:02:43] bugs that's right do you know he said
[2:02:47] that oh if I had my phone I'd pull it up
[2:02:49] for you right now but I'll get off
[2:02:52] track I'm not interested in what's wrong
[2:02:55] I'm interested in what's
[2:02:57] right amen so it gave us this he gave us
[2:03:01] the
[2:03:04] spirit right so that we could do the
[2:03:07] works that the spirit would what lead us
[2:03:11] and guide us in all truth and
[2:03:16] righteousness well what is the real
[2:03:20] truth it's not facts that's out here
[2:03:24] right because you can't even see love
[2:03:28] right right you if I was to ask you to
[2:03:31] describe love all you could do is
[2:03:33] describe all the characteristics that we
[2:03:36] know that go with it
[2:03:38] loyalty uh longing to be with somebody
[2:03:41] the ability to spend much time with the
[2:03:45] person and not have them get on your
[2:03:47] nerves you
[2:03:50] know time is the greatest test of a
[2:03:57] marriage I had a friend one time he said
[2:03:59] he dated a girl for a year uh and uh
[2:04:04] they went out together and everything
[2:04:05] which I'm not totally against if it's
[2:04:07] done right and and uh let that one get
[2:04:11] out there for a while I can defend my
[2:04:13] place it's why nobody gets married no
[2:04:16] more nobody wants to spend time with
[2:04:17] anybody nobody wants to talk to anybody
[2:04:20] nobody wants to to be together together
[2:04:22] they can't do it everything's got a sin
[2:04:24] tank to it you know well we just need
[2:04:27] his more Spirit-filled people all you
[2:04:30] get a spiritful boy and a spirit filled
[2:04:32] girl together they can do something
[2:04:35] together and it would be as
[2:04:40] clean you can go read the testimony of
[2:04:43] the of the lady that dated brother
[2:04:46] Brandon what a gentleman he was how kind
[2:04:49] he was never did anything
[2:04:52] you know un seemingly and everything
[2:04:57] he's just you know just
[2:05:00] perfect so if
[2:05:04] we the
[2:05:07] truth you're going to lead us and guide
[2:05:09] us in all truth and righteousness the
[2:05:12] truth about
[2:05:17] you the truth about you the truth about
[2:05:20] me
[2:05:22] is what God put me here
[2:05:24] for my spiritual
[2:05:29] career a pattern of good
[2:05:33] works you know something you do for the
[2:05:36] kingdom something that burns with inside
[2:05:38] of
[2:05:39] you I remember when I came off of that
[2:05:43] roof and the Lord had taken that suicide
[2:05:46] Spirit off of man the desire to no more
[2:05:50] more live you know why people take their
[2:05:52] lives they don't have they can't find a
[2:05:54] reason to
[2:05:55] live that's right Satan has separated
[2:05:59] them from their spiritual and Christian
[2:06:04] career they have no Christian Pursuit
[2:06:07] they have no
[2:06:09] work God don't need
[2:06:12] Believers Satan believes and fears and
[2:06:15] trembles right God needs men and women
[2:06:19] who will who seek what it is that God
[2:06:22] called them to do what Their heart's
[2:06:24] desire is to their fellow man whether
[2:06:27] they're a Believer or not it's easy to
[2:06:30] be good to someone that sees the way you
[2:06:34] see it's easy to take from somebody who
[2:06:37] will lend
[2:06:39] again but someone that's a real genuine
[2:06:43] Christian that that does
[2:06:45] good that that visits the poor that
[2:06:49] feeds the hungry that has a pattern of
[2:06:53] Good
[2:06:53] Works they're they're being a Christian
[2:06:57] they're pursuing being a Christian
[2:07:00] Christian isn't something that you
[2:07:03] believe Christian is something you are
[2:07:06] Christianity is a
[2:07:10] career it's a possession it's a Pursuit
[2:07:14] it's a trade a trade means it's
[2:07:17] something that's got works that produces
[2:07:19] a result yeah it's
[2:07:26] genuine oh if we give half as much time
[2:07:29] oh just give 10% of your time to the
[2:07:32] kingdom God only ask for 10% of what
[2:07:35] you're blessed with how about just giv
[2:07:37] them 10% of your
[2:07:39] time you'll be so blessed you'll turn it
[2:07:42] to
[2:07:50] 20
[2:07:52] and
[2:07:56] righteousness I'm going to send you the
[2:07:59] spirit so he can lead you and guide you
[2:08:03] that you might find your
[2:08:06] career that you might do the works that
[2:08:09] I
[2:08:10] did every one of you is different every
[2:08:13] one of you touches people that we can't
[2:08:17] touch but
[2:08:20] please don't get to the place that you
[2:08:24] think because you believe this
[2:08:28] message that gets you
[2:08:31] in that's why you've got to be borned
[2:08:35] again you've got to have a
[2:08:38] nature and that new nature seeks after
[2:08:42] that which is
[2:08:44] spiritual it seeks after the works that
[2:08:47] the father would have me to do and my
[2:08:50] question to
[2:08:52] you this
[2:08:54] morning
[2:08:56] is and I ask this to
[2:09:00] myself can I go much
[2:09:04] higher than I
[2:09:09] am you
[2:09:11] know people that play
[2:09:16] golf their whole
[2:09:18] goal is to
[2:09:22] limit the number of
[2:09:24] shots they
[2:09:26] take and you find out what a pursue it
[2:09:31] is they hit two to 3,000 balls a week
[2:09:36] they play four and five rounds they take
[2:09:39] lessons I tell anybody anybody that
[2:09:42] played golf said you want to be better
[2:09:45] take
[2:09:46] lessons otherwise be happy being a
[2:09:50] hack
[2:09:53] be happy you hit the ball in the woods
[2:09:55] be happy that you dig it out of the sand
[2:09:57] be happy hitting 120 Strokes around you
[2:10:01] know be happy you're outside but you'll
[2:10:03] never be good you'll never be
[2:10:08] good without learning
[2:10:12] it
[2:10:14] baseball you can go play baseball and
[2:10:17] get a hit every now and
[2:10:20] then you know what a guy that's good at
[2:10:22] baseball does hours it's a career it's a
[2:10:28] Pursuit and those things pass
[2:10:32] away the things we're talking about are
[2:10:40] Eternal every man's going to be judged
[2:10:42] according to his
[2:10:46] works and if his Works aren't right
[2:10:48] they'll be burned by
[2:10:50] fire right but nevertheless you'll be
[2:10:52] saved by fire
[2:10:56] right the Bible is not
[2:11:00] theology the Bible's
[2:11:02] life and the Bible is the Life of Christ
[2:11:06] manifested in you in the career that he
[2:11:10] called you
[2:11:13] in so this morning I want you to ask
[2:11:16] yourself can I go
[2:11:19] higher can I be a better Christian can I
[2:11:23] do more Christian
[2:11:25] things can I Step Beyond the
[2:11:29] limitations of my mind and
[2:11:33] body and be able to say I can do all
[2:11:36] things through Christ Jesus who
[2:11:38] strengthens
[2:11:40] me can I go the extra
[2:11:43] mile can I give my clo will I even
[2:11:48] recognize do I even have the spiritual
[2:11:50] eyes say sa that I'm required in this
[2:11:53] day give me ey Sav that I might see give
[2:11:57] me gold tried in
[2:11:59] fire which is Christlike
[2:12:02] character give me right reain it to be
[2:12:05] clothed in the work of the saints that
[2:12:08] my
[2:12:09] nakedness doesn't appear show me your
[2:12:12] faith without your

[2:12:26] vocation can I go
[2:12:29] higher can I do more for the kingdom of
[2:12:35] God have I really sought after and
[2:12:40] worked on and practiced
[2:12:44] Christianity Christianity is a
[2:12:47] practice you practice Christianity you
[2:12:51] do
[2:12:52] it you do it
[2:13:04] amen I afraid too many times the
[2:13:08] musicians will come this
[2:13:12] morning I usually call them magicians
[2:13:15] but cuz to me it's magic how they can
[2:13:18] play so
[2:13:19] long but if
[2:13:24] I mean can we you know can we ask
[2:13:26] ourselves am I really
[2:13:29] pursuing or trying to
[2:13:32] find my Christian
[2:13:37] career and there a question I just
[2:13:39] wanted to leave with
[2:13:41] you this
[2:13:43] morning have I even given it
[2:13:45] consideration I
[2:13:47] even asked myself is there something I
[2:13:50] can do
[2:13:52] for my fellow man Lord what would you
[2:13:55] have me to
[2:14:00] do Lord you know all
[2:14:03] things you know that I love you you know
[2:14:07] what he gave Peter
[2:14:09] then he gave him a career right feed my
[2:14:16] Lambs feed my
[2:14:19] sheep and I'm just asking asking you
[2:14:21] this morning have you sat down not with
[2:14:25] your buddy not with nobody but just
[2:14:28] yourself said what more can I do for the
[2:14:31] kingdom of
[2:14:35] God lord what what what is
[2:14:40] it I see what other people do
[2:14:44] and but I want something for
[2:14:47] me I want it to be real for me
[2:14:52] and that's what I'd like to challenge
[2:14:54] you with this
[2:14:55] morning because
[2:14:58] honestly I think that that's what God's
[2:15:00] looking more from out of his church
[2:15:04] though I understand all the
[2:15:07] Mysteries though I speak with
[2:15:10] the tongues of men and
[2:15:12] angels and have not charity it profit me
[2:15:17] nothing I become a sounding timble and a
[2:15:21] tinkling
[2:15:23] brass my life gives an uncertain
[2:15:29] sound and I hope the Lord's stirring you
[2:15:32] up this morning and you're asking what
[2:15:36] can I do to be a better
[2:15:39] Christian many of us need to start by
[2:15:42] applying the
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:47] token get your house ready for him to
[2:15:50] come in yes get your house ready for
[2:15:53] others to come
[2:15:56] in and I think if we
[2:15:59] just press the mark and have a greater
[2:16:04] understanding all the seals were opened
[2:16:07] and all the Mysteries because the
[2:16:10] scripture says great is the mystery of
[2:16:14] godliness to be like
[2:16:17] God Amen I hope that you take it to
[2:16:20] heart this morning let's Stand
