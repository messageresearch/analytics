Description:
Remembering God's Crowning Achievements
Br. Andrew Bohannon
September 8th, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

communion we trust the Lord will bless you with those blessings today and not just His blessings but his presence because we know that there's healing and communion we know there's deliverance we know that anything that God has made provision is within the service tonight so whatever you have need of I trust the Lord will be your portion tonight let us pray together our precious Heavenly Father Lord Here We Stand oh God bu a conscience Lord of Lord our inability but father Lord you when you rose from the dead you gave man gifts Lord you gave them ability Lord that they can oh God lay their own will and their own way to the side father and that you can have the right away Lord that you can use Mortal clay Lord that you've Sanctified by the blood of the Lamb Lord and that you could oh god build up your body lord it's it's in these times Lord that even like we've heard the this morning Lord that we just want to draw closer to you Lord we pray you'd come now tonight Lord and use these little words of inspiration Lord that it can go right to the heart of the believer and that they could drive back the enemy that's trying to keep them from serving you with all of their heart father we just trust them into your care we pray blessings oh God on them and our pastor our brother Billy the different ones that couldn't make it tonight Lord pray you'd be their portion tonight as we commit ourselves to your great hand we love you and we thank you for this time that we can worship and praise you by fulfilling your word in Jesus Christ name amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles we'll just go right to a little scripture thought and you know as I was thinking of the sermon this morning it brought me to a thought about remembering God's crowning achievements it's it's something very special when you think about what the prophet you know the the different things that he endured the different things that he suffered and through the different examples when you can see you know how Christians believers they suffered for things we want to bring into our mind and remember these great things that God did through these lives because then we can identify the very things that we're going through the struggles the sufferings it's for a purpose that God has a crowning achievement that he's accomplishing in each and every one of your lives you believe that God is working his purpose in every one of our lives and because the seed of God is inside of your heart the only thing that really can draw that out is certain circumstances and situations that cause it's the distress like I love that about Jesus being in the ship it wasn't until the the storm came that actually the believer called upon him in the distress amen so we don't realize the potentials of God a lot of times until we get to the end of ourselves amen well we just thank God for the seed of God that and when the storms come it brings the very life of the seed to the surface we love that amen and I just trust that the Lord will give us a little bit of direction here cuz oh my you know we got about five minutes worth and we just know that God's able to multiply the Loaves and Fishes amen so if you just want to go to me with me to Leviticus uh chapter 23 we're just going to you know one of the things that I think that happens for us as end time Believers is every time we read the scripture or we go into have a service we're remembering what God achieved through Malachi 4 and what that was to do for us an achievement that was going to restore our faith right and so in Malachi it talks about remembering the law of Moses what he commanded and so this is a beautiful scripture I love this and this is in Leviticus 23 and we'll just start in um verse verse 28 Leviticus 23 and 28 it says this there and ye shall do no work in that same day for this is the day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God for whatsoever so it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever so it be that doeth the work in that same day doeth any work in that same day that Soul shall the soul will I destroy from among the people amen we're also going to read over in Timothy second Timothy you know I think about the Affliction of the soul is to be burdened for lost souls whenever you've met the Lord whenever you've come in contact with his presence and has changed your life there's got to be a Life of Christ that wants to go out and seek that's what is lost [Music] Amen in second Timothy Chapter 2 it says this thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus you may have your seeds we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word and you know I just got to thinking about it if if we're going to be Crown if we're going to be capped with something at the end time it's going to be something that the prophet said we were going to be capped with amen if you look around and you see in this world a lot of people are so consumed and so full of things of this world or themselves that they don't have time to slow down and smell the roses or even look over at you to see if you have a need amen but I thank God that there's a people that God has placed this true love this Divine love of God in their heart amen and not not anybody has the privilege or the ability to project this kind of love it takes the seat of God it takes those who have been predestinated by God Amen we got to thinking about you know this this crowning that we're going to talk a little bit about tonight is is something that that happens in a forsaking time you know and I'll be drawing a little bit of inspiration from a sermon that brother Brandon preach called remembering the Lord and it's one of these things that you know communion is to talk to you know and a lot of times when we come to communion you know we we know that it's an ordinance of God we know that we're called to obedience and different things but a lot of times we don't take the time to stop I don't take the time to stop down and recognize you know communion is you know we lay our burdens down we tell God all the things that we're going through and the struggles and how we want him to help us and and we speak all of those things but I believe communion is more than that I believe communion is a time where we can speak those things and then we can be still I love how brother Jeremy when he was preaching there was a time to slow down I think there's times for us to slow down and get down and let the Lord speak back I think that sometimes I do too much of the talking and and we find that we are prone to this we do all the talking and we constantly it's just a one-way street but I believe that God wants to have a true communion with us amen that's part of the calling of a Christian is to hear back from God we don't serve a wooden or a dead God we serve a God that's living he's present he wants to speak to us he wants to deal with our individual cases he's not concerned just so much of a whole system of man but he wants to deal with hearts amen because he wants to reveal himself and make the light of the gospel live amen that's the god that we serve that's the god that we're looking for tonight to come and speak to us amen but you think about this in Timothy he says be strong in the grace that is in Christ now you know sometimes I think people get excited when they're coming up young people when you get to a place where you know you start saving all your coins and your alls and then all of a sudden you get a bank account all of a sudden you got this bank account and sure enough you get access access to those funds when you get like a a little ATM card or something all of a sudden you're getting man I'm starting to give responsibility I can go out and make some purchases now but you know that card is not good until you activate it amen that that card you can flaunt it all the way around and you can go and try to make a purchase but it'll be declined if you don't activate it I love it because that makes me think about this scripture it says be strong in the grace of God that's in Jesus Christ if we're ever going to be effectual with the gospel it's got to be the grace of Jesus Christ amen it's not because of our good works amen it's because we've gone back and recognized the achievement in our lives it was by grace are you saved through faith amen it was the grace of God that met us so if we're going to have a an effectual working of a lasting achievement that God crowns our life it's going to be Grace Grace amen that's what the prophet said that this end time bride is going to be calling out Grace Grace and it's not just uh quoting scripture but it's going to be our actions it's going to be other people saying that life that impacted me was just nothing but Grace Grace amen does isn't that your heart's desire to commune with God in this kind of relationship it was it was Grace Grace it it was coming and going amen it wasn't just me the recipient of Grace but it was me giving Grace oh my thank God for the love of God Amen my we want to remember the power source you know and just go back to it sometimes I think like brother Matthew was preaching this morning sometimes we forget things right and we just want to remember I was thinking about it earlier today I want to remember you know when you place a vow before God and God comes to you and it's so personal when you first start walking with the Lord you remember oh how sweet and precious everything was just smooth and oh my you just and you were on cloud n as it were and and then you know you go through it for a while and and it kind of becomes dull and you you have to remember the achievement of God in your life amen I remember when I was on my deathbed I told the Lord I said you know I will serve you all the rest of my days no more arguing you know what kind of behavior I would conduct myself with if I forgot that that's good to commune with God and to go back sometimes and remember you know what God had achieved in my life sometimes we get going on one way and one angle and then all of a sudden it's almost like we feel like we've done something but oh my if we can go back and remember I am a workmanship of God this is God's hand of workmanship in your life and we want to remember this is what God is crowning us with you know when you think about he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and today we're the people of God because God God had a work in our lives it was the grace of God praise be to God for this wonderful choosing and just read a little bit here in in that second per that second verse it says and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit to Faithful Men Who Shall teach who shall be able to teach also others thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that Warth entangle himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who have chosen him as a good soldier you know I I like that the this the reference there on chosen it says enlisted you know and and that's another thing I think that it's important for us to recognize is that we've been enlisted to fight we've been enlisted to be a soldier of the Cross and we want to commune and recognize we're just pilgrims here amen and there is going to be a hardness that we want to endure according to the word of God as he's admonishing us Amen to to endure the hardness as a good soldier you know and I think if if we look at that verse 5 it says if if a man if a man also strive for Mastery yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully for the husbandman that labor must be first partaker of his fruits you know I think about you know someone who would perform in different things and but they never were crowned you know they didn't strive lawfully but you know I I think about what a crown represents a crown represents identification a crown represents a certain an achievement and I just think about the admonition that you know Paul's giving Timothy and I think it's a consideration you know that we must take is you know we don't want to be entangled with the things of the world because this world is perishing at such a rapid Pace you know we realize all of the demise of the world is because man is taken of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and here we are it just seems like the ball has rolling so fast they they cannot stop it man destroys himself by his knowledge amen and it's not God's desire that any man would perish but that all would come to the saving knowledge of the Lord Jesus my think about it the husbandman that labor must be first a partaker of his fruits you think just like what brother Matthew was saying there's a lot of times like yeah I I remember brother brandom saying in the sermon and I'm paraphrasing but there wasn't one crosseyed girl that came through the prayer line that wasn't healed oh you think about it I there you know I was thinking about this um they have this particular tree and I'll butcher the name if I try to say it and maybe I'll say it but it's like an Argo wood or something like that and some of you may have heard of it but this tree is very rare now especially because they found that it's when it's been bruised or it has some kind of infection that starts uh happening with in the tree it creates um some kind of oil out of the tree that they extract and it's the most valuable fragrance this is like a precious ointment and I'm telling you that's the same thing that happens for a Believer amen you go through different sufferings you think about what Christ suffered when he was bruised it squeezed out of him something so precious and I just you know I want to say something tonight that will encourage your heart as a Believer the things that you're going through you might not recognize the suffering but God's recognizing it God knows that he can use that he can take that and it can be a sweet smelling Savor to somebody who's in need they can see I'm going through a battle and I seen that you know what you're going through same stuff I'm going through what is the hope that you have oh then you know I think it's something you know God he said in his word that we were made Kings and Priests unto our God you know and and a king you know he's been given authority over a kingdom and a priest is to make intercession so when you've been called as a king and priest when you see this suffering and you see this need and you know what it's like you've been there it's not like you're just talking a bunch of theology you've been there and then all of a sudden you don't have to go and write all the the wrong but a priest starts making intercession a priest starts praying and and really taking that burden upon the heart amen and that's when we see the God of all power come on the scene amen isn't that wonderful to be called the Sons and Daughters of God Kings and Priests unto our God my my my I just think about we'll skip down a little bit there says consider what I say and this is in verse 7 the Lord give thee understanding in all things remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffered trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I will endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory for this is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us amen he says if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself for these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that strive not about words to no profit to the subverting of the hearers amen and this right here is where we're getting to in in 19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name name of Christ depart from iniquity amen you know iniquity has two sides right how many knows what iniquity is praise God you know iniquity is to do to know something's wrong and do it anyway right and then on the other side it's to know to do right and refuse to do it right and so what he's he's admonishing us if there's things that we're doing wrong or that we know that's right we're not doing just depart from the iniquity but in the great house there is not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth and some honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purges himself from these he shall be a vessel of Honor Sanctified meat for the Master's use prepared unto every good work work oh I love that so much cuz I feel like that's the believer's cry that's what I identify with I want to be uh something in the Master's Hand prepared and fit for his use and I believe that's what communion is about I think communion is a time to talk it over things that we may know that we're not doing that you know we need to do or things that we're doing this is a time to clear all and get a clean slate to to ask the Lord that I'm going to remember the achievement that you had when you died on the cross of Calvary I I I I need to come into this greater Fellowship you know one that there's nothing hindering nothing in between amen that I can know that I'm connected to God not just connected to God but connected to his people connected to the people of this world that I can be a Shining Light I don't want to be so just in my mind Heavenly bound that I forget that I'm to be a witness amen that's what communion is about is go into all the world and preach the gospel Amen to know you know I remember that when I laid hands on the sick they recovered praise God he's the same we look around we see all kinds of darkness and sickness but oh my he's the same he doesn't change amen praise the lord we can be meat for the Master's use prepared unto every good work Hallelujah you know I was thinking about in that message remembering the Lord and I think this is in paragraph 27 says this of course this we read this is a communion service and he says do this in remembrance of me now communion has many times been a great dispute down the ages between Protestant and Catholic they say the Catholic takes this communion and they take it in hopes that they have did something to Merit some good thing and that their sins will be forgiven by doing it my you know and and I would say this that's that thing is it locks into the subconscious of Believers like I'm doing this to Merit some good thing you know but that's you know this is the other thing he says the Protestant taking it it is in remembrance that Christ has already forgiven me and I take it in rejoicing that he's already forgiven me you're forgiven amen praise God Paul goes on to say how that they should come to the Lord if there be anything wrong make it right before we get there for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and now we are very very much to be in prayer when we take communion my but I wonder many times if that work word we use it just right communion now communion means to talk to to commune with I wonder if we really when we meet together like in these Heavenly places if it isn't communion that we are communion with God and talking to him and then if we just sit still and let him answer back many things and one horrible thing that I do I try to do all the talking and not set still enough for him to answer me back oh my you know it just I tell you it runs down into my heart conviction you know how much really I need to pray like this you know I love the the word of God and how the message just brings instruction and Clarity and how we can commune with God we don't have all this figured out right we're on a journey together amen I thank the Lord for the message Amen in 32 it says sometimes I did that and my whole opinion changed you see I'd go to him and say Lord now these people they really they've got something and I believe I want to go over there and I just started praying and the first thing you know I just satisfied that it's the Lord's will but after I pray if I just linger a little while see then it's changed altogether some sometimes since somewhere else just commune with the Lord oh what a glorious Fellowship just get down and talk and commune and wait for him to talk back my what a precious word amen and I think of what a great person and to think what a great person that you are talking to the Creator himself communing with him who put life in that volcanic ash that you're living in and then Som day you'll have to leave there and then it's in his hands where you're going to go there on and you have the privilege now to make your choice which way the soul goes when it leaves my my and what a wonderful thing to commune with him upon the basis of his his promises then hear him commune back to you and say it is all well my that really expresses it right we don't have to look to any Creed we don't have to look to any dogmas the only thing that we have to do is just know that he Witnesses back his word and that's settled and that's all of it then the burdens roll away oh my I thank the Lord for that kind of ability to remember you know what I'm talking to the Lord you know and he's made these promises amen that's what our fellowship is and then I got to thinking about you know it's when you look back at the examples of different individuals like the woman at the well you know how that she was living and all her immorality and God came her way and saw so fit to deal with her and she was all broke up about the traditions of the elders and you know all the different difficulties in her relationships but one day she came to a fountain amen and at that Fountain she met the one that changed everything she actually came to a different Fountain amen and that's the fountain I'm pointing to tonight I want to remember that God opened up the door and made a way that we can draw from the fountain every single day not just at communion service but every day we can go to the Fountain and refresh oursel and God can speak back to us we can go and say God I need a drink I'm going through something I have this condition I have this problem but I know that I've gotten a drink from this Fountain before I want to talk it over with you will you talk back to me amen that's the kind of God that we serve one that spoke to her and said you know it changed her whole world after that time she began to say you know it was totally illegal for her in that condition being a prostitute to even be showing up but you know what because she had a different source of power because Grace had met her she came to a place where she realized come see a man who's told me all that I've have done amen he's given me something that I can rejoice in something that I know that it's not just some outside Source but there's something on the inside I can't help it I can't hold back amen I got to tell somebody about this Fountain it's a fountain of life amen she wasn't ashamed of that Source amen and then I thought you know about um you know Hagar my goodness Hagar you know can you imagine she's just a slave you know Abraham's wife uh Sarah said yeah go ahead and take you know Hagar and here Hagar is she's just doing what she's told told she's just following the order and you know at that time polygamy was totally legal so she's just carrying on with what her master was telling her so she goes and she ends up having this child and all of the sudden now you know things happen and she's like now she's all of the sudden you know facing this uh it's like a a putting out you know and here here she is now she has to go and she's just going down the way and you can read the the testimony of her life but she comes to a place where her child ishmail they came to a place they were in a desert land you know they're sand can you imagine being in the desert and all the sudden you know the the baby that you know it was totally lawful what she had you know but she was put out and all of the sudden you know she's out in the middle of nowhere perishing but oh my think that she she came to a place where she just laid that baby down and went down somewhere and kned down and all of a sudden she began to cry out and you know it was a place that was like so dry you know rocks and sand and different things but she saw in Old waste amen she came to a place where God spoke to her amen that was the cry she was praying and God spoke back and then she began to say that this is a living God who sees me amen and there has opened up a well that supposedly today is still open as a testimony that God still cares for the perishing when there's no water he said I am the fountain come unto me amen so you think about this Hagar and she has a memorial God crowned her with this Fountain can you imagine to realize that God has crowned us with a Fountain of Life I mean we had nothing but death we we were perishing the only destiny that we had was a grave we couldn't Hope For Nothing past that we couldn't see past that but oh my when he took the keys of death hell in the grave and he opened up the way amen we have something to look back and recognize this was an achievement of God this is what I'm communing with there is a a River of Life flowing out from me amen I don't want to be stifling the flow amen I want God to use this Fountain amen oh my what a memorial thank God you know my brother brand said this in 104 and remembering the Lord said about Hagar there she was a slave girl to begin with and had tried to act in the right way that she was supposed to act in here she got the little baby in her arms and it dying and she was so sad she laid it under a little Bush and went about a bow shot and nail down to pray and there appeared a well oh my The Well of him that liveth and seeth me stand still today it was put there some way the well stands as a memorial oh my I thank God for that you know you think about how God would even look at you know different ones and brother brandham you know I so appreciate the quotes this morning but you know you think about brother brandham saying and this is out of a message called the flashing red lights of his signs of his is coming but he says this now in 165 he says oh God I know give me the grace never to complain I want my life Lord I want my people's life God grant that our life could be crowned no matter if we suffer whatever takes place how many turns against me I know this one thing in my life as I get older my friends the streams behind me will soon be running out narrower and narrower as I go down the road and I know one thing it'll come to pass after a while there'll be no one come to me and ask and say or ask me advice the ones you who know me when I was younger days they're gone if I shall live my friends will get fewer and fewer as I get older and I know that someday I'll got to die and I hope God never lets Satan Crown me with an old crabbit indifferent man my wife an old nagging woman or a wife or your or your wife that way I pray brother that your lives will be crowned with the fruit of the spirit love joy longsuffering gentleness patience truth faith in the Holy Ghost amen I believe that's your destiny Amen to be crowned with the fruit of the holy spirit amen hallelujah praise God well praise the Lord you know I got to thinking about you know sometimes I like to go through and as the um you know the table app they they send you quotes and different things I just love it so much but you know when I think about crowning achievements I think about brother brandom and our Lord and the different ones but you know God has a crowning achievement in your life and I'll say this if you can hear these different testimonies in the scripture they're given for admonition that you can see yourself in the word of God you can identify with characters in The Bible and say mama that's me you know but I think about this in present stage of my Ministry brother brenham's making these statements and uh oh my I just think about how brother brandham in a forsaken time God was going to Crown his ministry you know all has forsaken me you know just like when Paul Paul was going through his great trials and you know all the people demons and the different ones you know they forsaken him my but it was a time that in a forsaking time God was going to Crown amen and the God is a god of patterns If He Did It For Those don't you think that we're in a time that it's a forsaking time people are forsaken the the the the scripture talks about at the end time there would be a great Falling Away people will forsake their faith but praise God there's a people that are fa forsaking their doubts all of their unbelief all of their backbiting all of their Nays saying they're just forsaking all of that amen praise God he says this in um present stage of my Ministry in uh 55 now I can imagine Deus didn't forsake Him and start start off at the nightclubs I didn't imagine Deus did that cuz Deus was a Spirit-filled man he was a great helper if you ever took a history of deus he was a notable preacher a fine cultured man high polished educated he was a smart man but why would he forsake Paul that's the thing what made him do it forsake Paul I don't believe he wanted to go to the nightclubs or anything but I believe that it was God's separation Paul amen it could just be that simple praise God God was separating Paul let's take some of Demus thoughts yeah okay I want to take some of Demus Thoughts by a Vindicated Prophet amen as I was sitting down on the hillside wondering the other day on a day on the daylight and I was thinking I wonder what Deus want to leave that fellow why would he leave that poor little preacher and that led him to the Lord the man that spearheaded the Revival against amongst the Gentiles and a prophet indeed no one could say but what he was a prophet that he was more than a prophet he was an apostle he was a great Mighty Apostle to the Gentiles and Deus would associated with Paul and had fellowship and seen the spirit of God move upon that man and why would he turn his back on such a person like that and Vindicated as he was as a servant of Christ did you notice Paul here loving this present world now I don't think deamus was backslid but I don't think that he did that but I think he got the wrong opinion of Paul oh my you know our opinions matter you know it's important to recognize in these times when we see the word of God when it's coming and and it's dealing with us in season we want to take that into our bosom this is part of the fountain this is part of God speaking right speaking back like our opinions of one another they matter in one instance because we want to we don't want to like if God wants to use that aspect of the body to let the fountain flow I don't want to have this kind of opinion of of Paul or anybody that you know we want to have that Grace [Music] amen crowned with the spirit of God Amen my now Deus came out of a rich family and was wealthy and money sometimes means religion to people my my was just go right on to 58 it says did you know our Lord did have a didn't have a place to lay his head did you know he only owned one coat see he had it and he was was the kind of person that was pushed about and he didn't have no place to lay his head but they could have thought the same thing and did about him now I believe that Demus saw a failing seemingly in Paul's Ministry my think of this the Deus he forsook Paul because he saw a seemingly failing in his ministry I think that he thought the old fellow was washed up before God now he thought that at people that would pluck their eyes out and give it to Paul now Paul said that he said I would have you at least plucked out your eyes and give them to me cuz Paul was I think he had bad eyes CU he said I wrote with such big letters amen and he says but I've got the lexan and it says with big letters he was in Rome in the prison there there and was something wrong that bothered him from the heavenly vision the people would have plucked their eyes out see Paul suffered his eyes bothered him and he suffered he asked the Lord to heal him three times and he said except I get exalted above the abundance of the Revelation there was sent to me a messenger of the devil that I might that might Buffet me that he might Buffet me now it would be pretty good then it would hit him again and then he'd get good and it would hit him again my you know when you think about this it just doesn't make sense to the mind of a man you know like this this man he was a Divine is a preacher Divine Healing he seen the supernatural power of God and then all the sudden he has this opinion because now he's packing a doctor with him he said it was good that Luke you know Luke was a doctor and he's like it's good that Luke's with me and he's got this problem with his eyes and here he is a praying man and he's answered so many other prayers but yet when he's asking for his eyes a touch on his eyes my to think about it that was part of the suffering but he said that that would keep him humble amen my think about it in 61 it says this you see Paul had a Ministry greater than any of the rest of the Apostles put together some of them could have said well I walked with Jesus why men on the street walked with him and when he was here but Paul saw him in the pillar of fire after he was dead buried ascended into heaven and returned back and called Paul see on the road down to Damascus he had a greater Ministry than m Matthew Mark Luke or any of them others he was Far Beyond them and he said except I get exalted now and say now you fellas don't have nothing in it I seen the Lord after he was resurrected well they say we walked with him well so did all the people around in Galilee and Nazareth and through the country there and they all walked with him but you see Paul had talked to him and saw him in the form he was before he was made flesh my and he commissioned Paul in that state while he was in the light he commissioned Paul and Paul had saw him and he said except I get exalted higher than any of the Brethren he gave me a messenger of the devil to keep me beat down to keep him beat down my think about it you know and if God would do do this for the man of God to keep him humble and to keep him in his hand to keep him you know actively serving him you know we want to look at our afflictions and our sufferings In a Different Light you know sometimes people get totally liberated and free then where are they depending where you we just want to remember it was God's achievement that brought us to this place [Music] amen oh my there in 77 says this now we find out that Paul De is preaching with Paul he had Paul see a crippled man laying there and he said I perceive that you have faith to be healed stand up on your feet and yet he leaves his friend Theophilus sick my think about the carnal mind just looking at it and reasoning like you left your friend back there who's sick and you're over here healing this guy you know if somebody's healed it's because of the Sovereign hand of God it's not because of gifts working in the church right this is God's foreordination you have an hour you have a season you have a time that God's going to come and make that manifest amen we're not trying to force God's hand at anything it's his Sovereign will to heal you amen we love the Lord he says Paul Paul Paul lost his ministry that's what Demus must have thought why he didn't why didn't he he's a gifted a gift of healing why didn't he just go up there and heal that that buddy that he stood by so faithful he said he left him up there sick and he ain't got no coat I want you to bring me that coat and and be careful for that copper Smith he ruined that meeting in the city and I had to to leave the town and put me in jail can you imagine Deus what kind of preacher he would have turned out to be see he says brother they got a lot of demon spirits in the world today they don't know what they're all about see no need trying to explain it because it won't do any good anyhow see a servant of Christ follows those Footprints amen and that's exactly right because you know when you think about communion and you think about remembering the works of God you know we want to remember what God did for us amen and you know the prophet can take us into the the Mysteries and different things but you have to go in there yourself you have to go in and plead the blood and ask God to speak amen and these are things that God wants to make known but my I have a few more quotes I'm going to read and then we'll get right on to communion says Deus and this is in paragraph 90 Deus said I ain't associating with a guy like that he's just a low class person you'll go up in that denominational brother and you go up where I'll be somebody and if it's such a thing I'd like to walk and ride after Baxter and get through and see he's leaving that poor little guy in that shape he ought to have been standing by him Paul was one who led him to Christ but you see it's without knowing the spirit knowing what the will of God is and doing the will of God but there they left him in that condition left him all men have forsaken him you know and I think one of the things that you know when we forsake certain things you know a lot of times we we think about compassion you know we want to have compassion on people and you know I believe compassion is knowing what the will of God is and doing it you know and I believe that the example was clear with the pool of the Bethesda when that out of all the people it's like a big hospital and people needed but there was only one when the waters were troubled that when they went in they were going to be healed but when he went in there and this is like you you're in your world a lot of times you you have compassion you go and you see all the needs of the people but you definitely want to be inspired of God you want to have been to that Fountain you want to have had communion and just know that this burden is directly from the lord it's not presuming anything I have the mind of the Lord concerning the matter you can go right to that person he was um you know I I can't remember what the exact condition was but he was healed amen but he passed by all of the others and this is not a a public show this this is just such an individual Affair amen but you have the power of a testimony what God has done in you you have a always that you've run to and even in community you want to remember that God has led you to a no way God has giv you some kind of source of strength something that gives life amen you know we couldn't find that anywhere else where could anywhere any of us have ever fin the satisfaction until we come into communion amen so we want to remember those things and you I think about and we'll just close up here in this last quote here and maybe we read one scripture he says this in 92 he says if there's there be one today that being in the same thing that's exactly the truth you have to hit the place that has to come they think that the man would have had a Ministry like that ought to have the world right under his thumb he should have but they won't come under his thumb see the man like that won't put a Ministry a world under his thumb he would put it under his master's thumb cuz he's not here to represent himself he's here to represent his master you know know man trying to seek honor one from another and they honor one another and dishonor God by doing so [Music] amen and this this is um in 94 he says now there's the thing I want to kind of exercise on for a few moments now it's usual to such a time as this when man that stays with the word of God stays true to the word of God and all men have forsaken him until God steps in on that person and crowns his ministry oh what a consolation amen you know you got to stay with the word of God Amen because then one time God's going to step in and Crown your ministry to vindicate what you're saying God's going to answer back this is this is the last one it says this in 111 in the Dark Hour mid rendering rocks darkening Skies as the poet My Savior bowed his head and died the opening Veil revealed the way of Heaven's joys in Endless days he had to do it in order to make a way for us that's right but what did God do he was true to his word heard and he embraced the cross but was in the end of his was that the end of his ministry was his ministry washed up God crowned it with the greatest crown that ever been crowned he crowned it on Easter morning on the resurrection he crowned it with the ministry of our Lord Jesus he raised him from the dead and is alive forever more he wasn't washed up because all men for forsaken him he was crowned yes sir yes sir he was crowned because that was he was he had been forsaken he had he must do that when he was raised from the dead amen I would encourage you to maybe go back and listen to these messages cuz they're just so rich but you know brother brandham said that he desired and this was in 121 that he desired that God would Crown his ministry by letting him take the clothes of the word of God and dress a bride amen and so you see the examples of lives lived as Crown God would Crown their Ministry and it would take the different um you know conditions like suffering or you're going through different causes but that's not in vain you know and maybe I'll close with this um scripture and it's found in Isaiah um 62 maybe it's not as familiar but it's one thing that you know when I take communion I remember what what it really means to be exposed to Christ and the work of God you know because all of humanity and all of what we're experiencing is because God had in his mind one goal amen that he wanted to have a bride for his his son if you look there with me in Isaiah 62 it says in verse one for Zion shall will I not hold my peace and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness therefore goeth forth as brightness and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth and the g Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord shall name Thou shalt also be crowned be a Crown of Glory in the hand of the Lord a royal diadem in the hand of thy God Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land no more be termed desolate but Thou shalt be called hezb thou and thy land buah for the Lord delighted in thee and thy land shall be married for as a Young Man Marth a virgin so shall thy son marry thee and as a bridegroom Rejoice over the bride so shall the bride so shall God Rejoice over thee amen we trust the Lord will encourage your heart on this communion as we invite our brother Matthew to come he's going to take over our communion service we just trust that as you remember that God is crowning your life with gra grace and mercy that the fruit of the spirit can be alive and there will be others that see this Royal diadem so it's a precious thing to have communion and Lord bless you Amen brother [Applause] Matthew man enjoyed that it's a good word Lord crowning achievement and remembering the Lord you know that's a reading out of that uh sermon present stage of my Ministry it's a a very Monumental uh sermon if you go back and and listen to that it's pretty profound but brother Brandon would come in and um start to talk about Timothy I believe verse four you know that's this the he tore that out of his Bible and put that in the Cornerstone of his church and then as his ministry moved into the third pool and he know all these things were there was just a big change in his ministry as he's preaching present stage he he knows that uh this is coming a time where he's not going to be with us much longer and um the angel of the Lord tells him prior to him preaching that uh to take Joseph Bose out in the yard and you can search that in the message and Brother Joseph Bose saying brother brandom have you ever read the rest of SEC second Timothy 4 as pertaining to your ministry and he's been he basically I say pertaining to his ministry because he's asking him if he ever read the rest of it and he says I mean I'm sure he's read it but he never really took it before the church and never really said anything on about it he goes well I guess I have it and as brother Andrew was was talking about that crowning achievement when you when you open that up and read what it says brother brandom knew with that that Vision that happened there was a big bang and he he thought it was the end of his life he was trying to make sense of it all when you go and read that it says my time of departure is at hand and so it was now that crowning achievement as brother Andrew was ministering that the opening of the word would come that he could dress a bride in his righteousness by his word but just as that true Elijah Ministry had to stand there he I must decrease that he might increase and his time of departure was at hand but what did Paul say there he said I've I've I've run a good race I've fought a good fight and because men have gone before and they've done their job we can do ours it'd be impossible without Malachi 4:5 for us to live an overcoming life because it was God's provided way in the end time and just in the Simplicity of that thought remembering the Lord know brother brandom says that uh well remember the Lord and remember his actions he was never in a hurry he was never Hasty you know uh think of what he would have done what decision he would have made that you would make the same one and as I thought about that crowning achievement isn't that what we want we want to come to the place of adoption where we're we're making the same decision that the father would make that when we're at work or we're on our job or something that that we would come to that place of maturity where we're do our word is just as good as the fathers and that's really uh being crowned with those fruits of the spirits where our decisions and the way that we conduct ourselves it's the very holy spirit that we're surrendering to that's manifesting those things and when we we we don't get it right we say Lord I didn't get it right but help me remembering the Lord I really enjoyed that let's just stand as we'll uh go into our communion reading and uh Corinthians and we we just uh before we go um into um the reading here um um we we're now that we're in the the newer building um we have two setups here and so um those of you sitting on this side you'll you'll come and there's two lines um so just form two lines and then as you come down you'll go back out and around and the same over here and I believe if we just keep that in mind it'll it'll run very smoothly so let's just uh go into our um communion reading and we'll just read verse 23 says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament and my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself let him eat of that bread drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Harry one for another and if any H man hunger let him meat at home that ye come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come we just say a prayer follow e e e e e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] the blood of of life I can all the blood of the Lamb greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleanses me it's the Great that still s let's go ahead and stand to praise him the blood I'm walking in new of life I canot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb amen let's just go ahead turn over into the Book of John Chapter 13 for our feet washing scripture here now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world un the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended and the devil now put it in the heart of judas's scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherein with he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet G and Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me oh don't you love Simon Peter Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith un him he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said to them know ye what I have done to you he call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you you know I I I want to do it the way the Lord did it it just wasn't a chore L Lord help us to to follow our example he said for I've given you an example that you should do as I am have done to you oh imagine the love and the just at the hour of of Christ's Ministry and how he really washed those disciples feet he said verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen sisters if you can go to a place that's prepared for for you Brothers remain here God bless [Music] you for
