[52:18] Valor but he was a leopard
[52:31] and the Syrian had gone out of the
[52:32] company and had brought away captive out
[52:35] of the land of Israel a little maid and
[52:38] she waited on on neon's
[52:49] wife and she said unto her mistress
[52:53] would he said would God my Lord where
[52:56] with the prophet that is in Samaria for
[52:59] he would recover him from his
[53:09] leprosy and and one went in and told his
[53:13] Lord saying dust and dust said the maid
[53:17] of this the land of Israel
[53:33] and the kings of Syria said to go uh to
[53:36] go and go and I will send a letter unto

[53:45] six uh thousand pieces of gold and 10
[53:49] changes of rmen
[54:03] and he brought the letter to the king of
[54:05] Israel saying now when this letter is
[54:08] come unto thee behold I have therewith
[54:11] sent nonon my servant to thee that thou
[54:14] mayth recover him from his leprosy
[54:34] came to pass that when the king of

[54:48] wherefore consider I pray you and see
[54:52] how he six quel against me
[54:57] [Music]

[55:14] heard that the king of Israel had rented
[55:17] his clothes that he had sent the king
[55:21] saying he has sent to the king saying
[55:24] wherefore H has thou rent thy clothes

[55:56] him saying go and wash in Jordan seven
[55:59] times and thy flesh shall come again to
[56:02] thee and thou sh be

[57:28] and his servant came near and spake unto
[57:32] him and said my father if the prophet
[57:34] had beat thee to do great things would

[57:41] rather then when he said to thee wash
[57:45] and be clean

[1:02:41] for his
[1:02:44] resurrection I said because I saw in
[1:02:46] your sleep you were talking and
[1:02:51] talking I said well maybe God will allow
[1:02:54] it one day
[1:02:58] but I know that we serve a powerful
[1:03:03] God uh from the scripture we've
[1:03:08] read I'm going to uh title my little
[1:03:11] sermon
[1:03:14] tonight your testimony will never be
[1:03:20] forgotten your testimony will never be
[1:03:23] forgotten
[1:03:26] you know every day in our
[1:03:29] lives every step that we
[1:03:33] make in reality is buil off a
[1:03:38] testimony we are impacting someone in
[1:03:41] our
[1:03:46] lives we can impact someone whether be
[1:03:49] positive or
[1:03:51] negatively but as Christians
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:59] God has G us gives us the ability to
[1:04:02] impact people
[1:04:07] positively Our Testimony can be
[1:04:11] verbal we could testify something to
[1:04:16] somebody but the greatest testimony that
[1:04:18] we could
[1:04:19] have is our
[1:04:22] lives is is what we are
[1:04:27] is The Way We
[1:04:31] Walk tells about a
[1:04:36] story uh there was a a Sunday school
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:44] superintendent and she was uh giving to
[1:04:48] kids giving them different
[1:04:49] characteristics of
[1:04:51] Jesus he said there was a man
[1:04:57] who could have a lot of
[1:04:59] power but who was
[1:05:02] humble you could you could curse curse
[1:05:05] at him but he would not
[1:05:09] answer when you did wrong to him he
[1:05:11] would answer with
[1:05:13] good he loved
[1:05:15] everybody he was only doing
[1:05:19] good she describe and
[1:05:22] describe he asked the kids do you know
[1:05:25] anyone one like
[1:05:27] that one of the kids lift up his
[1:05:30] hand he it's my neighbor he leaves right
[1:05:34] right next to
[1:05:36] us
[1:05:37] why because there was a Christian Living
[1:05:40] next to
[1:05:41] them so the kids was
[1:05:45] noticing that in this
[1:05:48] neighbor they were characteristics of
[1:05:51] Jesus
[1:05:54] Christ that's the story The look at the
[1:05:57] story we just
[1:06:00] read and most of the time when we speak
[1:06:03] about this part portion of the
[1:06:06] scripture we often time bring up
[1:06:14] non but what I would like to bring most
[1:06:16] is this little Maid Israelite
[1:06:23] maid look at this young girl who was
[1:06:26] brought in in
[1:06:30] captivity who she found herself in a
[1:06:33] pagan
[1:06:38] country in the middle of a place where
[1:06:41] they didn't practice anything that the
[1:06:43] Israelite
[1:06:46] did in in other word in an environment
[1:06:50] where there was not the word of God
[1:06:54] Amen but this young
[1:06:58] maid she she knew that in
[1:07:01] Israel that there was a
[1:07:04] god there was a
[1:07:12] prophet she had a testimony that the god
[1:07:15] of Israel was a real God and it was a a
[1:07:18] a
[1:07:20] a a real God
[1:07:26] imposs she knew that there was nothing
[1:07:28] impossible to this
[1:07:34] God she had proof she had
[1:07:42] testimonies that she knew that the god
[1:07:44] of Israel was capable or able to heal
[1:07:47] nonon of his
[1:07:54] leprosy she didn't start to reason to
[1:07:57] say that maybe if I tell him
[1:08:01] this that if he goes to
[1:08:05] Israel maybe he's not going to be
[1:08:09] healed what is he going to think about
[1:08:11] the God of
[1:08:12] Israel or what is he going to do to
[1:08:15] me that was not her
[1:08:18] problem what she
[1:08:21] knows that God is real
[1:08:25] God send a
[1:08:27] message with all the power of
[1:08:31] God that every all that you have to say
[1:08:35] is that in this message there's a
[1:08:39] prophet that in this message there's a
[1:08:43] word that in this message there's
[1:08:47] healing that with whatever with what you
[1:08:52] have that if you can only come into the
[1:08:55] message
[1:08:56] message God will bring the
[1:09:04] solution many times we get in a in a a
[1:09:08] place of
[1:09:12] comfort we we have this impression that
[1:09:15] God is
[1:09:19] limited that is not the god of of of
[1:09:22] certain
[1:09:23] things that the God is is not the god of
[1:09:26] certain
[1:09:27] people and he not the god of the
[1:09:30] others he made a
[1:09:33] promise that whosoever
[1:09:37] believe and that whosoever will be
[1:09:40] baptized will be
[1:09:45] saved and these signs and wonders will
[1:09:47] follow them that
[1:09:51] believe it's not the signs that will
[1:09:53] follow the preachers
[1:09:57] or a group of
[1:09:59] Believers but all those that
[1:10:02] believe they have to
[1:10:05] believe that they believed in the god of
[1:10:08] the
[1:10:09] impossible who has no
[1:10:13] limit and sometimes our
[1:10:16] comfort is limiting
[1:10:21] us we're talking with brother Billy back
[1:10:24] there
[1:10:26] and old testimony came to
[1:10:31] me I just believed the message uh not
[1:10:34] not not too
[1:10:38] long and my dad didn't want me to go to
[1:10:41] message churches
[1:10:55] perhaps many of the young ones will not
[1:10:57] know in Africa we had uh uh this machine
[1:11:00] the tap tap riter
[1:11:05] don't and as you type it so that that
[1:11:07] that the thing on top was
[1:11:12] moving and when you get to the the end
[1:11:15] of the page you have to push the whole
[1:11:17] thing
[1:11:18] back and that's how it
[1:11:23] function I was took the machine and I
[1:11:26] was typing this uh uh hym uh uh close to
[1:11:31] D and as I got to the
[1:11:37] middle I was at the end of the page so I
[1:11:39] brought back the top so it will start
[1:11:45] again so it looks like there was this
[1:11:49] like a a string or something that was
[1:11:51] broken the the the the top was not
[1:11:53] coming back anymore
[1:11:56] so when I bring it and it just slides
[1:11:58] back every time I bring it back it just
[1:12:01] slides I said oh I'm in
[1:12:04] trouble because when my dad will
[1:12:08] come and because I was typing a a
[1:12:12] h it's going to be
[1:12:15] hard so I just took a cloth and I
[1:12:17] covered it I I went to my
[1:12:21] knees I I started praying over the
[1:12:23] machine I said Lord you
[1:12:26] know I am trying to type a himym it's
[1:12:30] it's to worship you and look at what
[1:12:33] happen I don't know how to fix
[1:12:36] it I'm going to try to go find someone
[1:12:39] who can repair it and help me find
[1:12:42] someone who can fix
[1:12:45] it I went out it was around
[1:12:52] 11: I went all the way out till like
[1:12:54] 5:00 p.m. I couldn't find anybody who
[1:12:56] could repair it so I come back
[1:13:01] home so I said okay I'm going to go
[1:13:04] verify again the machine before I know
[1:13:06] the trouble is at the door you tissu so
[1:13:08] I take out the the T piece of tissue I
[1:13:11] covered it with the machine is back to
[1:13:14] normal I type and I type I I push it
[1:13:18] back it was back to
[1:13:20] normal I didn't know who fixed the
[1:13:22] machine
[1:13:24] the I don't know what happened while
[1:13:26] it's gone but all I
[1:13:29] know that the machine came back to
[1:13:33] normal C tape and back then we we used
[1:13:37] to have what what we call tapes C
[1:13:42] Machine and it was those with a string
[1:13:44] that you will put in the radio and place
[1:13:49] pray three days later the the the the
[1:13:52] the the the radio stopped
[1:13:59] working so I said to myself well the
[1:14:02] same God who did something three days
[1:14:05] ago he's he's capable of fixing this
[1:14:09] radio I took the radio I
[1:14:13] prayed I
[1:14:15] tried it didn't
[1:14:18] work the next day I tried it again it
[1:14:21] didn't work two days later
[1:14:25] there was a brother who came to visit
[1:14:28] me and as we were uh communing or having
[1:14:34] Fellowship I said oh you know my radio
[1:14:37] is not working but I wish I it was
[1:14:38] working I could have play tape so we can
[1:14:42] listen he looked at me and says well I
[1:14:44] fix radios he said bring it he fixed it
[1:14:49] and we prayed the tape we started
[1:14:51] listening to the
[1:14:53] tap it was God in that
[1:14:58] time the first time I didn't know how he
[1:15:00] fixed the the
[1:15:02] typewriter but the second time he sent
[1:15:06] someone who can fix
[1:15:14] it and God is not answering according to
[1:15:18] the way we want him to
[1:15:21] answer but all that we know for sure
[1:15:25] is when we ask with by
[1:15:28] faith he will
[1:15:30] answer how he's going to
[1:15:33] answer it's none of none of our
[1:15:38] business but all that I have to be
[1:15:41] certain
[1:15:42] of that he will
[1:15:46] answer look at
[1:15:49] NE after receiving this great
[1:15:52] testimony my prayer
[1:15:55] is that
[1:15:57] tonight that each one each and every one
[1:15:59] of
[1:16:01] us that we can be like this little maid
[1:16:04] in the
[1:16:06] house where we
[1:16:14] go even if we encounter somebody who's
[1:16:17] in the worst sin
[1:16:22] possible even when you see him you look
[1:16:25] at him you say this is certainly Satan
[1:16:29] incarnated that we
[1:16:31] know that will be like this little Maid
[1:16:34] of
[1:16:35] Israel that in
[1:16:37] Israel in the message there's a God who
[1:16:42] has the power of
[1:16:45] transformation who can take you in the
[1:16:47] states that you are
[1:16:50] in and make you the most purest
[1:16:53] Christian there is
[1:16:55] the most powerful chrisan that there
[1:17:03] is God GES gave us a
[1:17:11] message and it's not how we want
[1:17:16] it but it's what God
[1:17:19] said when he said
[1:17:22] it himself
[1:17:26] says our
[1:17:30] problem it's not is he going to believe
[1:17:32] or you're not going to
[1:17:35] believe is God going to change him or
[1:17:38] not going to change
[1:17:40] him is God going to heal him or is God
[1:17:42] not going to heal
[1:17:43] him he said what we do is we throw the
[1:17:46] net rest the
[1:17:49] rest it's God himself that brings it to
[1:17:53] pass
[1:17:56] and God helps us may God help us look at
[1:18:01] this young man we don't know her
[1:18:06] name if was still
[1:18:09] alive I was probably going to
[1:18:13] pray that may brother Bram give us her
[1:18:18] name because what would have been able
[1:18:21] to look and say her name was
[1:18:25] but he's already
[1:18:28] gone but the testimony of that little
[1:18:31] young
[1:18:32] girl will never be
[1:18:35] forgotten
[1:18:40] says in uh time tested Memorial of
[1:18:45] God uh paragraph 80
[1:18:57] but the Living Word of God still remain
[1:19:01] just the same and just as
[1:19:04] valuable that's a
[1:19:07] memorial so I say today
[1:19:11] Brothers the things that you
[1:19:15] do the words that you
[1:19:18] say how you treat your
[1:19:23] neighbor and what you you do about
[1:19:28] Christ will be an everlasting
[1:19:34] Memorial you might have a fine a fine
[1:19:36] home to live to your
[1:19:40] children you might be working for some
[1:19:43] livelihood to live to your
[1:19:49] children but I would rather leave them
[1:19:51] the word of God than anything else
[1:19:56] those houses will
[1:19:58] vanish that's perfectly all right that's
[1:20:02] good I have nothing against
[1:20:09] it but don't do those minor thing in and
[1:20:13] leaving the great thing
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:21] undone because the word will the house
[1:20:25] will perish and the people will perish
[1:20:27] with
[1:20:35] it but the word of God will raise them
[1:20:39] up in the last day and give them
[1:20:41] Immortal Eternal and Immortal Life
[1:20:46] again and now in order to make an estate
[1:20:50] like
[1:20:53] this God's Eternal
[1:20:58] Word it's by God's Eternal
[1:21:02] Word only God's
[1:21:07] word that he has to bring
[1:21:13] us to have the testimony that would
[1:21:17] remain
[1:21:21] forever God did great things in this
[1:21:23] message
[1:21:28] God certainly has done a lot great
[1:21:31] things in in in some of our
[1:21:36] lives like brother Billy was saying this
[1:21:41] morning most time we go back in the
[1:21:51] comfort that if we really want to be in
[1:21:54] church every Sunday every
[1:21:58] Wednesday we can ask to
[1:22:03] God he may not answer
[1:22:06] today but if we are
[1:22:10] sincere and if we have
[1:22:16] faith from the bottom of our heart we
[1:22:19] really want to be
[1:22:23] there God will will honor our
[1:22:29] faith many times we we it becomes a
[1:22:34] habit you know already the devil has
[1:22:36] placed in
[1:22:39] US forgive me I call it the
[1:22:45] devil because I believe anything that
[1:22:47] stops us from going into the house of
[1:22:51] God it can only be the devil
[1:22:57] uh he sometimes the devil places us here
[1:22:59] in the United
[1:23:00] States oh there are bills to
[1:23:03] pay if you don't work you won't be able
[1:23:07] to if this happen that's going to
[1:23:12] happen but our God is
[1:23:18] Limitless John
[1:23:22] sh sh but talks about John
[1:23:36] charrot oh he he was breaking bricks for
[1:23:39] 25
[1:23:43] cents it was hard for him to make
[1:23:50] it he he he saved a little he saved
[1:23:53] money and he bought a little
[1:23:56] house and one
[1:23:59] day there was a an evangelist who came
[1:24:03] by and God told
[1:24:05] him he says give your house to this uh
[1:24:11] evangelist he went and told his
[1:24:13] wife God told
[1:24:20] me you know you know sometimes if you
[1:24:23] don't have Grace you know when tell your
[1:24:24] wife he's going to ask you how did God
[1:24:26] tell
[1:24:27] [Laughter]
[1:24:32] you they said well if God told
[1:24:37] you we have no
[1:24:41] choice uh they they gave they gave away
[1:24:44] their
[1:24:49] home they went and and negotiated and
[1:24:52] found a place to live in a in a woman's
[1:24:59] and this
[1:25:00] woman noticed that John shot was reading
[1:25:04] his Bible
[1:25:06] regularly and that he was a real Christ
[1:25:08] Christian honest
[1:25:10] man one day uh she he WS
[1:25:15] up he said that God made it God placed
[1:25:20] in my heart
[1:25:26] to to lend you a certain sum of money so
[1:25:29] you can start
[1:25:33] business it said well if you give me I
[1:25:35] won't even know how to reimburse
[1:25:39] you it said well God placed in my heart
[1:25:42] that's not a
[1:25:44] problem and I see that you read your
[1:25:46] Bible
[1:25:47] regularly you look like a good
[1:25:50] Christian there's there won't be any
[1:25:52] problem
[1:25:54] he took the
[1:25:55] money he went and bought a home a
[1:25:59] house an old
[1:26:01] house that he fixed
[1:26:03] up and he
[1:26:05] sold he bought another one he sold
[1:26:11] it but when said he prospered so much in
[1:26:14] the real
[1:26:17] estate that he was paying Tiding of
[1:26:20] about a million
[1:26:22] dollar from 20
[1:26:27] cents to his Tiding being a million
[1:26:31] dollar who could have imagined
[1:26:36] that
[1:26:40] why he accepted what God asked him to
[1:26:50] do he he accepted what God presented him
[1:26:54] as an
[1:26:57] opportunity we reason so many times with
[1:27:00] the
[1:27:02] word we ask so many questions with the
[1:27:07] word we hesitate so much with the
[1:27:17] word it which shows it seems like the
[1:27:21] god of the impossible seem to have
[1:27:23] things that are
[1:27:29] impossible maybe God will bless you in a
[1:27:32] different career in whatever you follow
[1:27:35] than what you are
[1:27:38] following but maybe where you think you
[1:27:41] already have the
[1:27:44] Comfort it's not where God wants you to
[1:27:48] be he wants to give you something
[1:27:51] [Applause]
[1:27:52] better and to give you time for you to
[1:27:55] serve
[1:27:59] him but it depends on our
[1:28:05] disposition it depends on what we
[1:28:16] want the world is presented in a way
[1:28:19] that oh if you lose this
[1:28:21] job you won't have anything else
[1:28:25] oh we are in the inflation period right
[1:28:28] now you saw that when that other person
[1:28:31] lost his job he couldn't find another
[1:28:34] one the other one over there when he
[1:28:36] lost his
[1:28:38] job he even got a job that they were
[1:28:41] paying him less than what he was getting
[1:28:44] so if you try
[1:28:45] now because you say there's a God it's
[1:28:49] your
[1:28:51] problem but this little made from is
[1:28:55] tell that the God of this
[1:28:59] message when you put him at the first
[1:29:02] place when you give him
[1:29:06] confidence he will show you who's the
[1:29:08] god of the
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:12] impossible what he wants from
[1:29:16] us that we give him a
[1:29:22] place the word teaches
[1:29:25] us that he wants to occupy the first
[1:29:30] place not just the place in our
[1:29:34] life but the first place in our
[1:29:38] life and when he has occupied the first
[1:29:43] place he said it's not a man that he
[1:29:45] should
[1:29:50] lie and he will not deceive you
[1:29:56] brother
[1:29:59] says in uh God's provided way for today
[1:30:03] for this
[1:30:05] day paragraph
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:13] 10 so God has made a way for
[1:30:17] us God loves his
[1:30:19] children he loves his people
[1:30:24] he wants to help
[1:30:26] them he wants to help
[1:30:31] you more than you want
[1:30:36] help God wants to help
[1:30:41] you more than you want
[1:30:47] help if you can just get that in your
[1:30:50] heart
[1:30:57] that God that God is is more willing to
[1:31:01] help you than you than you are to help
[1:31:06] yourself but he has a
[1:31:11] way and that's the only way that it will
[1:31:17] work you must come to his
[1:31:21] term not your term
[1:31:24] his
[1:31:27] term you want it to be a certain
[1:31:32] way but he gives it to you his
[1:31:36] way he's he's he's he's he's made
[1:31:39] himself
[1:31:41] available he's ready to help
[1:31:46] us but in a
[1:31:49] condition that we accept his condition
[1:31:54] that we may accept his
[1:31:58] word that we may say Amen to every
[1:32:02] word and the rest how is he going to
[1:32:05] help
[1:32:06] us it's not my
[1:32:09] problem what I
[1:32:11] know that is if I accept his
[1:32:15] condition if I follow his
[1:32:19] word he is
[1:32:21] more than ready to help me
[1:32:29] it means there's not a condition under
[1:32:32] which I will find
[1:32:35] myself that he won't be able to secure
[1:32:38] to help
[1:32:41] me even when the enemy has defeated
[1:32:45] me that if you do this because of uh
[1:32:49] because of the
[1:32:51] word oh if the enemy will will defy me
[1:32:54] and says if you do this because of the
[1:32:57] word it's the occasion to do it and to
[1:33:01] tell
[1:33:02] him I'm going to show
[1:33:05] you that my God is more than
[1:33:11] able God can prove
[1:33:14] you he won't answer the first day you
[1:33:18] may not answer the second day you may
[1:33:20] not answer the third
[1:33:22] day has an answer the first
[1:33:26] year God the devil will always come you
[1:33:30] see I told you how many
[1:33:33] months oh my God my God I told
[1:33:38] you tell
[1:33:40] him my God told
[1:33:43] me and I believe his
[1:33:47] conditions is more than wanting to help
[1:33:52] me and will do it
[1:33:56] certainly
[1:33:58] says
[1:34:02] like dipping in the waters of
[1:34:09] Jordan why he said the water up in his
[1:34:12] country was much
[1:34:18] better it was it was clean and better
[1:34:21] but that wasn't what the prophet said
[1:34:25] that's not what the word
[1:34:31] said dip
[1:34:34] here he dipped
[1:34:36] once leprosy is still there six
[1:34:40] times it still there was it was still
[1:34:43] [Music]
[1:34:45] there he had to oby and come God's way
[1:34:54] and when he when he fully obey God's
[1:34:59] way leprosy the leprosy
[1:35:04] left it's when we obey fully to the way
[1:35:08] of
[1:35:11] God God is more than able to help
[1:35:17] us this message is full of
[1:35:20] testimonies not just in the life of
[1:35:23] brother
[1:35:25] but in the life of many of of
[1:35:28] us we can
[1:35:31] say that God is more than wanting to
[1:35:34] help
[1:35:35] us that we that more than what we want
[1:35:40] help but the problem with
[1:35:44] us that the enemy is trying to keep us
[1:35:50] distracted the enemy wants to bring us
[1:35:53] down
[1:35:57] the the enemy is trying to make us think
[1:35:59] that our God is
[1:36:02] limited when we have a god who's
[1:36:07] unlimited and each one and every one of
[1:36:09] us can experiment that
[1:36:12] God each and every one of us who's a son
[1:36:15] and the daughter of
[1:36:16] God he can have an experience with this
[1:36:19] God
[1:36:23] but continues and he
[1:36:26] says and I say
[1:36:32] tonight that if we obey we obey God's
[1:36:36] provided
[1:36:38] way lepry will
[1:36:40] leave sickness will
[1:36:43] leave everything will
[1:36:47] leave but we got to come his way for
[1:36:50] this day
[1:36:53] now depping in the Jordan
[1:36:57] Jordan wouldn't do any good
[1:37:00] now that was for
[1:37:03] non the law was for the
[1:37:06] Jews Grace is by
[1:37:16] Christ God wants us to accept this Grace
[1:37:20] by by Christ
[1:37:25] and become uh Witnesses of this
[1:37:30] grace and every time we testify about
[1:37:33] his
[1:37:37] grace even even if they don't write our
[1:37:40] names in the book in the
[1:37:44] Bible Our
[1:37:46] Testimony Our
[1:37:50] Lives is written in the book of
[1:37:55] remembrance the Bible says in Malachi uh
[1:37:58] chapter
[1:38:03] 3 Malachi chapter
[1:38:12] 3 uh verse 16 to
[1:38:18] 18 the Bible says
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:40] then they that fear the lord spake often
[1:38:43] one to another and the Lord hearkened
[1:38:46] and heard it and a book of remembrance
[1:38:50] was written before him for them that
[1:38:52] fear the lord Lord and that and that
[1:38:56] thought upon his
[1:38:59] name so when you testify one to
[1:39:02] another God
[1:39:05] listens he opens a book of remembrance
[1:39:09] and he writes it down and he writes it
[1:39:15] down he says
[1:39:21] [Music]
[1:39:31] shall be mine sayeth the Lord of hosts
[1:39:34] and in and it says and in that day when
[1:39:37] I make up my jewels and I will spare
[1:39:40] them as a man spareth his own son that
[1:39:44] serveth him
[1:39:56] then shall he return and discern between
[1:39:59] the righteous and the wicked between him
[1:40:02] that serveth God and him that serveth
[1:40:05] him
[1:40:07] not when you testify one to
[1:40:10] another the book of
[1:40:13] remembrance and God
[1:40:16] says it's not you but he
[1:40:20] himself he will make it so that
[1:40:24] that people will
[1:40:26] notice the
[1:40:28] difference between those that serve God
[1:40:32] and those that don't serve
[1:40:39] him the this the Bible talks about elas
[1:40:43] and the shite
[1:40:48] woman how that the shite woman was good
[1:40:50] to Elijah
[1:40:55] and how God by Elijah gave the the the
[1:40:58] the child to this
[1:41:00] woman how that how that this young child
[1:41:03] died and God came and resurrected
[1:41:06] him when there was
[1:41:09] Hunger H Elisha went and told this
[1:41:12] woman that there will be a terrible
[1:41:16] famine go around the country
[1:41:19] first when the when the when the famine
[1:41:22] will be ended
[1:41:24] you can come
[1:41:27] back and this woman had such a wonderful
[1:41:32] testimony that God wrote In the book of
[1:41:37] remembrance and the Bible says in the
[1:41:40] book 2 Kings chapter
[1:41:44] 8 that this
[1:41:46] woman when the when hunger when when the
[1:41:50] famine was was
[1:41:52] finished she came
[1:41:54] back and she lost
[1:41:57] everything and she went to the
[1:42:01] king so that the king may be just to
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] her that she may uh uh get back the
[1:42:11] things that she had
[1:42:13] lost and what did God
[1:42:16] do when the woman goes to the
[1:42:19] king it was Gaza who was next to the
[1:42:22] king
[1:42:25] gz was testifying to the
[1:42:28] king what God had done throughout the
[1:42:31] the the the
[1:42:33] Elijah and it was telling the king there
[1:42:37] was a
[1:42:38] woman oh it was a wonderful
[1:42:41] woman a true
[1:42:44] Christian and she was really good
[1:42:46] towards
[1:42:48] Elisha and even one day she lost the
[1:42:51] child
[1:42:53] and she didn't cry she didn't
[1:42:56] panic she came to the
[1:42:59] prophet and we asked her what was going
[1:43:01] on she said all is
[1:43:05] well until until when she got to the
[1:43:10] prophet he said is it me that asked for
[1:43:13] you for a
[1:43:15] child I was fine without a kid you gave
[1:43:18] me a child and look at that child is
[1:43:21] dead now I know that you are able to go
[1:43:24] and raise him
[1:43:26] up and as GAA was given a testimony of
[1:43:30] this woman they open the book of
[1:43:34] remembrance the the this woman gets into
[1:43:37] the king's building he says oh
[1:43:41] King if I can recollect or get back the
[1:43:45] things that I have
[1:43:46] lost and G looks he says
[1:43:51] King the testimony that I've been giving
[1:43:53] you now that's the
[1:43:57] woman we're going to read
[1:44:02] it uh 2 King chapter 8 verse
[1:44:07] [Music]
[1:44:10] one I'm going to go a little
[1:44:16] far I'm going to finish
[1:44:19] soon I'll take verse three
[1:44:33] and it came to pass that at the seventh
[1:44:36] year end that the woman returned out of
[1:44:38] the land of philistine and she went
[1:44:40] forth to cry unto the king for her house
[1:44:43] and for her land
[1:44:54] and the King talked with gahz gzar the
[1:44:57] servant of of the man of God saying tell
[1:45:01] me I pray thee all the great things that
[1:45:03] Elisha had done
[1:45:26] and it came to pass that as he was
[1:45:29] telling the king how that he had
[1:45:32] restored a dead body to life that and
[1:45:36] behold the woman who uh whose son had
[1:45:40] been restored to life cried to the king
[1:45:43] for her for her house and and her land
[1:45:47] and gaha said my Lord oh King this is
[1:45:51] the woman this is her her this is her
[1:45:54] son whom Elisha restored to
[1:46:13] life and when the king asked for a woman
[1:46:16] she was she was she told him she told
[1:46:19] him so the king appointed unto her her a
[1:46:23] certain officer saying restore all that
[1:46:26] was hers and all the fruits of her field
[1:46:29] since the day that she had left the land
[1:46:32] until
[1:46:34] now her testimony was not
[1:46:39] forgotten and God will make it so you
[1:46:42] can come at the right time for your
[1:46:47] testimony

[1:47:02] instruction to
[1:47:03] Daniel paragraph

[1:47:21] that God deals with this Israel only
[1:47:23] when she's in her

[1:47:32] left his homeland and went down into
[1:47:35] Egypt what
[1:47:43] happened he walked away from the will of
[1:47:46] God and and never was blessed till he
[1:47:49] returned back to the to the Homeland

[1:47:57] Vision nothing no nothing
[1:48:01] else till he came back to the
[1:48:05] Homeland look at
[1:48:08] Israel when they were when they were

[1:54:50] you may God help
[1:54:54] [Music]
[1:54:55] us to take this message to
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:03] heart to to be like this young girl from
[1:55:06] [Music]
[1:55:08] Israel that God sent a
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:13] message and there's everything in this
[1:55:17] message there's not one person in this
[1:55:21] world who has a
[1:55:24] problem who who won't find an answer a
[1:55:27] solution in this
[1:55:29] message it's us that are
[1:55:34] hesitating it's us that are thinking
[1:55:37] that those problems are are bigger and
[1:55:39] greater than this
[1:55:40] message but this young girl her
[1:55:46] testimony she didn't think about what
[1:55:48] would happen
[1:55:49] next all she knew
[1:55:53] that there was a
[1:55:56] prophet look at what happened with
[1:55:59] [Music]
[1:56:01] non the the young girl gives him a good
[1:56:06] testimony that in Israel there's a
[1:56:15] prophet so n instead of going to Israel
[1:56:18] to meet the
[1:56:20] prophet he goes to his King
[1:56:23] oh look listen to what they told
[1:56:26] me the king who doesn't know the
[1:56:31] message he said well I don't
[1:56:34] know when I hear they talk about Bram
[1:56:38] you know I don't
[1:56:40] know you know I'm going to write a
[1:56:44] letter I'm going to send you to the
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:47] king they don't send him to the
[1:56:50] prophet so he gets to the
[1:56:53] king the the the king reads the
[1:56:56] letter a good denominational
[1:56:59] King look
[1:57:02] look the
[1:57:04] power to heal a
[1:57:06] leop but look at this guy is looking for
[1:57:09] trouble since
[1:57:11] when I have the power to give life or to
[1:57:16] take life or to heal a leopard he says
[1:57:20] no he's looking for C I don't want
[1:57:23] problem he takes the letter and he just
[1:57:26] rips
[1:57:31] it it's true he didn't have that
[1:57:36] power and when elishah heard of
[1:57:39] it he says
[1:57:42] oh but I I think they
[1:57:45] misunderstood the one who testified
[1:57:48] it because Elisha was able to see what
[1:57:52] was happening in the King's
[1:57:56] house so as they were prepared because
[1:57:59] remember as they were preparing for
[1:58:01] war he said but that that girl told
[1:58:05] them go see the
[1:58:07] prophet why did they go to the king so
[1:58:10] the girl told them that it's in the
[1:58:15] message why are they saying it's the
[1:58:17] Baptist
[1:58:19] Church they don't have the same power
[1:58:22] to to to to stand against this the uh uh
[1:58:26] def the uh the
[1:58:29] [Music]
[1:58:31] challenge oh because we all preach the
[1:58:33] same
[1:58:35] Bible you know when he
[1:58:38] preaches it's like the
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:43] message that's why I said well it's not
[1:58:45] a problem even if they go there
[1:58:48] no the young girl said the
[1:58:53] message if you go somewhere
[1:58:56] else he's going to he's going to rent
[1:58:59] his
[1:59:01] clothes to say that he does he doesn't
[1:59:03] have that
[1:59:04] power but the God of this
[1:59:09] message has everything that we
[1:59:14] need let's all

[2:08:16] You
[2:08:17] Hallelujah man what a wonderful message
[2:08:21] man to just be like this young
[2:08:24] girl not overthink stuff and not how
[2:08:29] it's going to work out and you know we
[2:08:31] become great mathematicians you know
[2:08:33] what I mean we have to know every
[2:08:35] equation how it's going to work out
[2:08:37] before we do and if I tell him is he
[2:08:39] really going to believe I don't want to
[2:08:40] waste my time if he believes it doesn't
[2:08:43] matter that's none of your
[2:08:45] business you just live the life you just
[2:08:48] testify you just do your part and then
[2:08:51] let go God do his part amen I trust
[2:08:54] that's uh you know the motive of Our
[2:08:57] Lives butam said is to worship him is to
[2:09:01] testify of him and and he talks about
[2:09:06] how how do we testify of
[2:09:10] him someone comes you and say well you
[2:09:14] know I'm going through a difficult
[2:09:17] situation and I don't know how to get
[2:09:19] out of it and all of that well that's
[2:09:21] your opportunity you don't you don't go
[2:09:23] in and just Pally said I know you know
[2:09:26] I've been going through the same thing
[2:09:27] no that's the opportunity to turn the
[2:09:30] conversation around that's right that's
[2:09:32] an opportunity to say I know there's a
[2:09:34] God in Israel oh this is going on over
[2:09:37] here that's your opportunity to say I
[2:09:39] know there's a God in Israel that's your
[2:09:42] opportunity to say I I've heard about a
[2:09:44] god of the message I've heard about a
[2:09:47] God who raised the dead I've heard the
[2:09:49] the the ultimate thing about this is the
[2:09:52] god of History wants to be lifted up
[2:09:55] today he promises the same yesterday
[2:09:58] today and forever what he did back then
[2:10:01] he's able to do today and the only way
[2:10:04] we raise him out of history is to bring
[2:10:06] about the same testimony of what he did
[2:10:09] and be able to know that he's able to do
[2:10:11] the same thing
[2:10:15] today but for the most part the enemy
[2:10:17] wants us to see and think that those
[2:10:20] things that days of Miracle are pass and
[2:10:23] sometimes I feel like our lives we live
[2:10:25] a life in such a way where we feel like
[2:10:28] oh God doing this no no he did back then
[2:10:31] but now no this is too much oh my only
[2:10:36] believe if we can get out of that
[2:10:38] Comfort like our brother talked and if
[2:10:40] we can get out of that mindset and say
[2:10:43] God whatever the situation is I believe
[2:10:45] you are the same today I believe that
[2:10:48] your word I believe that your promises
[2:10:50] are the same I believe you were the same
[2:10:52] yesterday today and forever you haven't
[2:10:54] changed one bit what you did yesterday
[2:10:57] if you open up the Red Sea how much more
[2:11:01] healed the
[2:11:02] sick but says I'm the god that healed
[2:11:06] all that diseases not just headaches you
[2:11:09] know it's funny because it's when you
[2:11:11] have a headache it's it's easier to
[2:11:13] believe in healing oh I believe he's
[2:11:14] going to heal me I believe it's going to
[2:11:16] because you know you have a tanol in the
[2:11:18] cabinet
[2:11:23] but the same God who heals the headache
[2:11:25] is the one who heals
[2:11:27] cancer the same God who heals the
[2:11:29] headache is the same one who heals
[2:11:31] diseases that they come up with names no
[2:11:34] names whatever butam says all those is
[2:11:37] just the devil it's just devil this gu
[2:11:40] under a different name he castes out the
[2:11:43] devil in whatever form he shows
[2:11:46] up oh that's why God is not asking for
[2:11:50] big things simp Faith yes the Faith Like
[2:11:53] A Lo little young girl all she knew is
[2:11:56] she grew up in an environment where she
[2:11:57] saw this great God when she saw she knew
[2:12:01] for a fact that there was a God in
[2:12:03] Israel she knew she seen it she see how
[2:12:06] the prophet came in the things that he
[2:12:08] did so she didn't care what's going to
[2:12:11] happen to her she didn't overthink about
[2:12:13] what the future is going to be all she
[2:12:15] said is I know there's a God in
[2:12:17] Israel and that's my heart desire
[2:12:19] tonight I don't care what problems
[2:12:21] you're going through I don't care what
[2:12:23] tomorrow is going to bring I don't care
[2:12:25] what challenge just bow your heads and
[2:12:27] say I know there's a God in this message
[2:12:30] oh my situation is difficult I know but
[2:12:33] I know there's a God in this message I
[2:12:35] heard testimonies I heard the pro The
[2:12:38] God Who created the scroll is the same
[2:12:40] God
[2:12:41] tonight we can't take it and put it upon
[2:12:44] the prophet the problem is every time we
[2:12:46] talk about the prophet we look about how
[2:12:49] he was born and all of those things but
[2:12:51] we forget that the same Prophet was also
[2:12:53] part of the Bride because he had to
[2:12:56] manifest he had to be the first fruit
[2:12:59] the first fruit of
[2:13:01] what right hallu of those that will
[2:13:04] believe of the same crop of the same so
[2:13:07] the god of the Prophet didn't go with
[2:13:09] the prophet that if we can do like
[2:13:11] Elisha take the same mantle and say
[2:13:14] where is that God of Elijah where is the
[2:13:16] god who did Miracles where is The God
[2:13:19] Who challenged all the devils where's
[2:13:21] the God who stood and millions stood
[2:13:23] there and and and but Billy Paul said
[2:13:26] that he sent him he says I want you to
[2:13:28] go find me somebody who has a problem a
[2:13:30] sick person and Billy Paul said I went
[2:13:33] and I looked for the worst that I could
[2:13:36] find the worst that I could
[2:13:41] find why would he do that I mean he
[2:13:44] couldn't find you know just something
[2:13:46] that we can work with no because he knew
[2:13:50] that Daddy served the god of the
[2:13:52] impossible he knew that I have seen that
[2:13:55] God that angel for myself he knew that
[2:13:57] what Daddy was doing he was doing based
[2:13:59] on a commission he says nothing will
[2:14:02] stand before
[2:14:08] you you know you you look at the he will
[2:14:11] stand there
[2:14:13] and it didn't matter what the situation
[2:14:15] was that was presented before him he
[2:14:18] will look at it and he will diagnose it
[2:14:20] for ex exactly what it was whether it
[2:14:22] was a devil challenging or whether it
[2:14:25] was someone who needed help he will look
[2:14:27] at him and he says you he you can feel
[2:14:30] the presence of God don't you you can do
[2:14:32] all of that why he was trying to show us
[2:14:34] that the same God who was in the body of
[2:14:37] Jesus Christ has come and visited this
[2:14:40] generation has come just like he did
[2:14:42] with the Jew that same God and came and
[2:14:44] was manifested to the Gentile why to
[2:14:47] bring us to the Faith of Our Fathers
[2:14:50] they didn't care they believed it
[2:14:53] regardless of the
[2:14:55] circumstances oh I trust tonight we can
[2:14:58] come and say God I believe regardless if
[2:15:00] we can go tomorrow when the next day and
[2:15:03] the next day when challenges arises you
[2:15:05] know we when we come to church and we
[2:15:07] hear a word like this we are all pumped
[2:15:09] up but this is not for when we are
