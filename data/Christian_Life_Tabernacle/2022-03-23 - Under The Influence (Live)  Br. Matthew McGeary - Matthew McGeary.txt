everybody's desire is that the lord would pour out his presence upon you and i know that by divine promise he's here to do it maybe you've had a rough week maybe you're facing some trials maybe the greatest trials that you've ever faced in your life well i just want to encourage you that you've just stepped into a predestinated moment in time that if by faith that you can look past the veil of the flesh and look to the word of god and to know that god ordained this moment in time to speak to you outside of faith then we're just playing church we're no different from any college campus that would gather together and have some person grab some knowledge and try to present some information but i pray that we've come together for something far superior to what man can offer but we've come into a supernatural presence where the author and finisher of our faith has come and he has designed a service in such a way that would speak to your life do you believe that let's just approach our lord jesus heavenly father you are our all and all there's none like you or that's why many have made the sacrifice they've driven many miles they've made great efforts to be here overcome many obstacles because it's not a man's doing it's what you are doing lord you've placed a hunger and a thirst inside of the believer and they want to be in the house of god this tonight lord that you would speak to him lord in myself i know i'm just a man nothing i could give to your people that would in that seed but lord if you would come lord if you would just come by divine promise and break the bread of life and feed your sheep lord that they would receive revelation lord and they would go from this place encouraged and strengthened and closer to you i pray we ask all these things in your name the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we'll be reading out of second corinthians chapter three if i can get some volume on the monitors brother mike well we want to remember our pastor and brother david and sister leslie as they're in san diego uh we're thankful he has an opportunity to spend this time uh with his mom who's 99 soon to be 100 years old so we're just thankful for that there's many that are out that aren't feeling well so look around if you see somebody that's not here i just remember them in prayer because i know there's some sickness and things that are going around we pray the lord would be their portion for those that are streaming we know that god can meet you there amen so we're just glad to be here second corinthians chapter three we'll read verse three through six it says for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust we have through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit notice that not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life amen you can have your seats as we'll just also turn in our bibles to hebrews chapter 10 verse 16 through 21. i don't know if you can give me any more monitor up here but if i need to use the handheld i sure can we we're trying a new uh device here so just bear with us as we we work through some of the kinks there thank you brother hebrews chapter 10 we'll be reading 16-20 says this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and uh we spoke um a while back on the revelation of the new covenant and something that was on our heart we had spoke about abel ministers how how god has given us uh uh the the revelation of the new covenant or the new testament which is to bring us into the presence of god we spoke a little bit about apollos how he was going around and preaching he was a man that was fervent and he was he was preaching to the people in my he could inspire the people but yet what he was preaching wasn't the revelation of the hour he he wasn't walking in the light of the hour that's why when paul came through the coast he asked priscilla uh he had an aquila i believe it was he asked him look uh you know how were uh how are you baptized they said we haven't heard of the holy ghost well uh we haven't heard of such things well how were you baptized we were baptized into john's baptism but he said look you got to be baptized in the name of jesus christ and so though though apollos was going around preaching the word he wasn't an able minister to bring the people into the presence of god and say praise god we received a vindicated prophet enable a minister that was able to bring us into the presence of god that we're not looking to creeds and dogmas and a bunch of work up amongst the people but there was actually a manifestation of the word that proved that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and by faith we can come up into those higher heights and enter into that presence and so uh maybe what i would like to just title the sermon uh as we were moving maybe towards a second part but some time has gone by and i i was just really uh enthused about this thought about stimulation of revelation along these lines but but as i as uh brother david uh got a hold of me today about uh uh the service tonight i just started to to think upon the word and something that's on my heart that's just settling upon my heart i want to preach to you if i can title this service this evening under the influence i want to speak to you a little bit about being under the influence and and by i tell you what i was blessed by sunday service oh oh my when the word is open to you when you're when your understanding is open to you my it changes everything uh like jesus said he that heareth my words you know the prophet picks that up and says well it's not he that hears my words but it's he that understandeth my words because when understanding comes it changes things you don't think it changes things well you know a lot of times you know you you might you might be spending some time with an individual or or you might know your neighbor and you get along just fine but but what happens if you find out some information about them you you you might you might find out some information that was hidden or or was not previously made known to you and also that's going to influence the way you act you know if you find out somebody in the neighborhood you know uh uh uh you find out their criminal record or something like that you'd be like wait i'm going to keep my kids from over there it's going to have an influence it's going to have an effect on you my many times you might you might put out an invitation you want to invite people over and everything well you know some people might hear about it but but details make a difference wait did you say there was food there oh who's doing it where what time where is it going to be and all of a sudden something that didn't seem like a priority to you all sudden you start getting some information you start getting the facts and also your your understandings opened up you're like hey i'm gonna be there you know i i think it's that way a lot about like church you know you might hear there's some meetings going on and and you know you you know you might hear oh they're so and so it's getting together over there and that's fine and everything and then you find out who's preaching well because we all got favorites you're like well i'm gonna make that a priority uh-oh yeah i tell you what yeah this flesh this old carry-on has a way of having an effect on you it has an influence on you so we just want to speak a little bit about under the influence and just maybe laying a little foundation i think brother cosmic for giving us a little time this evening brother branham says in the token he says uh testament means covenant the new testament means the new covenant the old testament was the older under the lamb and the life could not come back on the believer the new testament was the lamb of god and his life comes back on us oh hallelujah blood's life see blood's blood is life in the new testament see life is from the blood of the lamb which means the new testament or new covenant that god after those days will i write my laws upon the fleshly tables of their heart see not upon the stony tables and a lamb's blood which you had to say yeah i got the blood over here now what does it say do i i i it's a shame but a lot of us are are serving the lord that way we're we're we're trying to follow the message that way and and we're doing it in such a way that where it's more of a a regulation or or what does it say over here and in yourself you're trying to carry out some commandments but he says but upon the tables of your heart oh and when the understanding is open up to you i tell you what sisters when the when the understanding has opened up to you why you shouldn't cut your hair you won't struggle with it anymore when i'm talking when you get a revelation i'm saying you're going to be tempted but as long as it remains up here in the intellect but when your understanding is open to you and the lord is revealing himself to you and his desires and something takes place it's going to influence you in such a way where where whenever that enemy tries to tip you to those things again you're going to shun the very appearance of evil you're going to say no to those things oh my i tell you what watch out the spirit of god is here you wonder why we struggle with some of those things it's because we're not coming subject to the message of the hour you wonder why there's problems in the home and you're going through things you're going and you won't make yourself subject to the word of god because you're just walking in religion but you're testifying to the church that you never come under oh hallelujah the subjection of the revelation of the hour and then you testify of how things aren't going right but i tell you all the presence of god is here this evening to convict you in your heart to bring you subject to the word of god that you'll lay down all your ideas and lay down everything that you thought was was right in your own mind and you'll follow the message of the hour regardless if you can't make sense of it but when the word is opened up to you and you know that it's god speaking to you it's not just a man's idea it's not just a theology it's not just a prophet's opinion oh but deity came down in the end time and he spoke a word to a bride and when that word strikes that seed on the inside something is quickened and brought forth to life it says yea an amen to the word you want to know whether you've got the holy ghost or not look at your life oh you say amen to the word if you're not saying amen to the word if you can look at the way you're living if you can look at the things that you're doing and see that you're not doing then your life is not saying amen to the word oh but let that quickening power come let it get shut up in your bones where there's a fire inside of you to serve the lord with all of your heart oh hallelujah then that's a life that's saying amen to the word it has an influence on you yeah i got the blood over here now what does it say do but upon the tables of your heart see the spirit covenant will i make with the people and it displays his power oh glory to god hallelujah we ain't a powerless church here tonight i got news for you this just ain't no gathering a man but god is here and what's your attitude towards the word what's your attitude towards the children of god god is here we ain't playing church there's a power here there's a power here to raise the there's a power here to grow limb there's a power here to open ears there's a power here to give sight to the blood there's a power here to change your heart there's a power here to deliver you of that spirit there's a power here to transform the man oh i pray that by faith you'll latch a hold of that word and you'll recognize what is taking place this evening in bedford texas oh this this this isn't some a walk in the park this isn't some uh children's book where we've all come together and we've heard some little fancy story about a prophet who had some signs about him no sir this is the end time revelation the very climax of god's great plan from the very beginning of the foundation of the world he saw fit that he'd have a bride standing in the end time that would be bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and life of his life and power of his power there are the people that have gathered together in beverly that got the power of the holy ghost in action oh you might as well have a little fun tonight i feel the spirit of the lord you might as well just get a loosey goosey and just enjoy the presents that's what we come here for we get all starchy and come together all buttoned up in our little suits and we don't even know how to have a good time anymore you can go down to the ball games you can go down to the restaurant you got a smile on your face you're eating your little tacos you're just having a little good time but when you come to the house of god you sit there with folded arms you can't even have a good time what's the matter with us this is what you're living for i ain't living for the things out there in the world i'm living to be in the presence of almighty god you might as well start enjoying it because that's where you're going to spend all of eternity with him oh glory to god hallelujah oh it displays his power he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and speaking on under the influence influence means the power or capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways i don't know if there's a handkerchief in my bag but if one of y'all can grab it i'm i'm good at doing that notice this it says influences the power or capacity of causing an effect it's in my black bag there on on the chair hopefully the power capacity of cause and effect in an indirect or intangible way it also means the act or power of producing an effect without apparent exertion of force or direct exercise of command you following that so there can be an influence upon something but you don't know where the influence is coming from i i i remember in in uh in sixth grade i did a little a project on magnets and i was just mesmerized by magnets you know you could you can take this magnet down here and maybe tie a string or something and you can make other things look like it's floating and suspended in air and and you know as you start you start getting it closer and closer together you start to feel the pull well glory to god that's just what happened in the end time down through luther down through the wesley until oh that word was gathered up into the seed and it was the rising of the sun and that great magnet of the son of man was shining forth in the ladies teen age and there was a wheat field full of seeds that were sprouting up oh they started to see that rising of the sun and they're getting closer they're getting closer all they just gets you just get pulled right to it that's what happens there's an invisible union look it's an unseen force something has taken place and you are magnetized to this word you heard that uh um you heard that uh how brother branham would talk about that story where where he went to that great factory and that magnet would sweep over uh uh uh all the metal parts and everything like that and brother brandon was watching it and all sudden all these things uh they would go up to the magnet but then other things would just lay there and brother ben said why is it that some of those things go up there but some of them stay there he goes well see you've got to be magnetized oh my what great inspiration you got to be magic you wonder why the preaching of this message has gone around the world seven times and men had stood and preached the message 40 50 60 years and people weren't drawn to it or they weren't magnetized to it or they walked away that's because there wasn't that that part of them that identified with that magnification thank you brother but something inside of you is magnetized to that there's something that god has placed into you oh and you're magnetized there's an influence on you right something is influenced and you don't you don't even know what it is praise god hallelujah we might be here a while but you but you watch that you can take you know you can put something on a table and put a little magnet under it and it looks like everything's fine it's just sitting there but start getting that that magnet a little bit closer and also it starts trembling it starts shaking why because it's coming under an influence oh many times children of god you don't know what's happening in your life but you're coming under the influence of the rising of the sun you're starting to come into the presence and all of a sudden there's an influence that's starting to have an effect on your life you're starting to shake you're starting to tremble you really don't know what's going on that's why because you're being attracted and it displays its power the works that i do shall you do also these signs shall follow them that believe oh yeah we've we've healed the sick we've laid hands on the sick they've recovered we we've we've laid our hands and cast out demons don't tell me i've seen it i've watched demons gnash their teeth in my face and talk in tongues had it happen this weekend i got witnesses that could testify of it and try to contact them try to ask them if they want deliverance from the spirit but they're under such bondage they're they're incoherent and they're speaking to you in tongues and gnashing their teeth with wide eyes and looking you right in the face a demon staring right back at you well you better know where you're standing because there is a power in this word i could stare right back at that demon and say all right if i can't contact the individual if i can't even ask the individual if they want deliverance then i know by divine promise that i can lay my hands on this person and i can cast that devil out and by divine promise we laid hands on that a brother we cast that spirit out and there he come into his sane mind we had more work to do he had more spirits it wasn't just one spirit it wasn't just two spirits but that religious spirit was cast off of him so we could ask him look do you want deliverance we could cast spirits off of people all day long only to see them again a week or two later with the same spirits back on them so so you know don't rejoice that the spiritual subject to you rejoice that your name is written in heaven look i i i i if i lay my hands on somebody and i can cast spirits off them i don't want it to stop there i want them to get the power of the holy ghost that they can live in overcoming life look what good does it do to come to church and get all enthused and get all excited and get into such an atmosphere because the prophet of god said it takes atmosphere to do things we come under this great atmosphere we come into this great expectation and the word of god is preaching you're raised up into heavenly places but what happens when you go outside of these doors when you go back out into the world you go back to your job and you go back to the friends what kind of life are you living what's your home life like what's the atmosphere like in your home i'm telling you if you're living below your privileges it's time to stop why would you go another evening without receiving what's what god purchased for you the baptism of the holy ghost complete deliverance just in speaking upon revelation revelation is a revealing or an unveiling right not not not not what you can uh think up in your mind not what you can understand but but revelation is a revealing or an unveiling like in john 6 when when jesus would say i am the the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world oh the jews they strove amongst themselves and he said what is he talking about how can this man give us his flesh to eat look that's a good question don't sit in your seat and look i'm like well man a bunch of unbelievers no it's a good question how in the world hear this man say i am the bread that came down out of heaven look your father's diddy man in the wilderness and every one of them is dead but i am the bread of life that cometh down how is that going to happen i don't understand how are you going to give me your flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you oh what does that even mean i tell you we need a spiritual revelation we need an unveiling we read things in the scripture all the time and we chalk it up to some history lesson but i say the word of god is the same yesterday today and forever unless you eat this flesh unless you drink my blood you have no life in you oh what does all these things mean here they come to to the upper room it's the last supper and jesus is speaking to him in matthew 26 27 it says and he took the cup he gave thanks and he gave it to him saying drink ye all of it for this is the my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins look look peter you don't know what i'm doing right now you don't know what i'm doing right now peter oh lord why are you washing my feet uh if not don't wash my feet look if you don't wash your feet you have no part of me okay then watch my watch my head watch them no peter you don't understand you don't understand what i'm doing right now peter you don't understand what i'm doing take this cup drink this cup it's the new testament of my blood oh well he wasn't just setting forth ordinances for the church he was saying do this in remembrance of me why why peter look you don't understand these things but you're going to understand hereafter because i'm going to send the holy ghost upon you i'm going to send you the great comforter he's going to teach you and lead you in all truth and righteousness that's what the church needs this evening we need the great comforter we need the tutor to lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness you wonder why you're stumbling and going along the way that you are and you're not living an overcoming life it's because you need the baptism of the holy ghost i wonder if there's somebody here that'll get in desperation and you'll start crying out you'll start hungering you won't settle for just a bunch of education you won't understand for just a message theology but something in you is crying out for the influence of the holy ghost to break out on the inside of you and bring your life into subjection to the word of god of the hour oh glory to god ye must be born again i want the holy ghost and fire to quicken my mortal body hallelujah oh quickening power prophet says in the fourth seal now just think of the things we're coming through let you eat my flesh and drink my blood take this cup this is the blood of the new testament we're having communion now right we're eating it's flesh we're drinking his blood when we come to together in communion we're doing it in remembrance of him what what is this symbolize what what does this mean lord what is this all about the prophet of god would say now as oil symbolizes the holy spirit then we find out oil and wine is connected together in worship see always connected in worship and the wine i said which to me that the wine symbolizes that it was the power maybe i can bring me some paper towels or something please i can hardly see up here give me an old shirt give me something hallelujah glory everybody feeling all right i'm feeling pretty good i hope you feel all right don't let that bother you don't bother me god's gonna have his will god's gonna have his way i hope there's still some hungry hearts don't check out yet god got something for you god got something for you you don't you don't watch a show or you don't you don't put on something to watch and check out halfway through do you know you want to stay there for the climax well by god's grace he got a climax for you he got something he wants to deliver to you now that's what i'm talking about bring the whole roll praise god hallelujah i feel lost without that hanky i don't know why it seems like that's one of my greatest struggles to get get a get a handkerchief to the platform maybe i'll just start sewing them to my shirt then if i don't have one we're all in trouble all right and the wine i said which to me that the wine symbolizes now follow this thought here right let's try to pull it together here uh uh jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood what does all this mean the prophet is picking this up in the forest seal he goes now oil symbolizes the holy spirit then we find out that oil and wine is connected together in worship see always connected in worship and the wine i said which to me that the wine symbolizes that it was the power it was the power of stimulation by revelation and that's when something has been revealed oh hallelujah that look stimulation by revelation so stimulation by revelation comes when something has been revealed or when your understanding is opened the pro our pastor was preaching on the opening of your understanding out of the rising of the sun because something is going to transpire that opens up your understanding that quickens your mortal body into a reality of the power of god in your life oh thank you jesus and that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by revelation see it's something that god has said it's a mystery they can't understand it see and after a while god comes down and reveals it and then it's vending and then vindicates it it's something that god has said it's a mystery they can't understand it oh well put your spiritual thinking caps on they can't understand it just go ahead and hold up the whole bible men have been probing at this for 2000 years having a portion or a measure of it it was a mystery but when the seals were open what did the prophet said he said it became a brand new book it's a mystery they can't understand it's he but after a while god comes down god comes down oh hallelujah god comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it oh my glory to god i had i wrote down a little here no here our pastor said he said spiritual revealed word that will cause you to do what you do spiritual revealed word that will cause you to do what you do this is also quoting our pastor he said the opening of the un the opening of understanding is the key to move forward pray for revelation he said pray for revelation the church never understands the importance of revelation god cannot move you forward without increasing your understanding that's what our pastor said on sunday god cannot move you forward without increasing your understanding we ought to start praying for revelation we need to pray that god would continue to open our understanding i think a lot of times we get too comfortable with the understanding and the revelation that we have and we're just fine we got it from here god thanks for calling me out of the world thanks for giving me a good job thanks for giving me a home and a nice family but i can take it from here lord i'm pretty comfortable living the way that i'm living i'm pretty comfortable understanding malachi 4 luke 17 30 and revelations 10 7 i kind of got that all buttoned up so i can be in my little social circle i can call myself a believer i can travel around the globe and hug everybody's neck but am i really pressing into the kingdom am i really living an overcoming life am i really hungering and thirsting for righteousness am i really praying for revelation and asking god to open my understanding are you going to your knees are you putting on the prophet's message are you listening to a tape and saying oh god reveal the message of the hour to me let me catch that are you rewinding it and going back you ever listen to the prophet's voice say i want to hear it again and you backed up 30 seconds and you do it over and over and over and something in your heart is saying lord i want to understand it i want to catch it lord reveal it to me and you're praying for the revelation have you ever opened up your bible and you read a scripture anywhere in the bible and it says knowing that he which was raised up the lord jesus shall raise up also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundance grace might through the thanksgiving of many rebound to the glory of god oh do we just blow right over you say lord really what are you saying i want to see jesus christ in every line oh god open up our understanding look if if we're not careful we get satisfied with education we we get satisfied with knowing about the power and not displaying the power look i don't want to settle for an explanation of the message i don't want to just i just have a good education look why do you go to college to get an education and several hundred thousand dollars in debt many times what are you going to do with it is that your badge of honor yeah it's great when you graduate college but it's really great when you get a job kids we're proud of you you've been in school through 12th grade and you graduated that's great it'll be really great when you get a job that's why you're going you're going to college to get an education to be put to work right so we we come to the house of god we read our bibles we pray we we're getting an education we're listening to the world i'll tell you what i think a lot of us have been in boot camp too long what are you interests for the military right they ship you off to boot camp you go to boot camp for six months or so so they can put you into service a lot of you have been in boot camp for 10 years on the pew and you've never gone out in the battle every time something gets a little uh a little tough on you you gotta run to the church house you gotta run to big brother you gotta run somewhere you gotta run back to your drill sergeant oh oh drill sergeant how did we do that again well the drill sergeant was like look this is what the great captain taught us this is the what the great captain of the army taught him when that drill sergeant can look at you like look now son i've done all i can do for you i've taught you how to fire the gun i've taught you how to march i i've i've walked you through the book and shown you how to dress and to talk and everything but i tell you what if you'll just get the life of the captain inside of you you won't have to run back here anymore because the word will be written in your heart oh i'll make a new covenant with you there is power in the blood there's power in the word and if you'll ever get born again and filled with the look i'm not knocking you it's okay uh we're here for you the church is here for you but i'm saying there's higher heights for you to walk in that when you're out there on the enemy's grounds or you're out there and the enemy comes and tries to take you down he's going to knock on the door and it's not going to be little on you anymore he's knocking on but it's going to open up and say hi i'm jesus christ the one that defeated you on calvary that's what you want on the inside you want jesus christ the word the quickening power that quickens your mortal body to put the word into action oh my education i think a lot of us settle for education we settle for second-hand revelation right oh yeah i pulled this quote in here i really like it because this brother comes to brother branham and say now brother branham you know uh you really he's basically telling them you need to get educated you know the people you know you're kind of offended of the people you keep saying pulpit you keep saying pull pit it it's it's pulp i don't even know how to say it right myself but he he was telling brother brandon you're not educated you keep saying pull pit and it's pulpit it's pulpit and he's telling telling his brother you know they care brother that these people they they're educated brother branham said he goes well my beloved brother i differ with you then people don't care whether i say pulpit or pulpit the thing they want me to do is preach the word and live what i'm talking about i said that's the main thing so christ doesn't come by education christ comes by a surrendered heart believing him now education's fine but it will never substitute salvation it can't and but in them days the people had got away as soon as education comes in the phenomenon leaves the church oh my listen to it now as soon as education comes in the phenomenon leaves the church christ leaves he can't stand it they get so smart they know more than he does so the scripture is not given by education it's given by revelation not education revelation oh god open up our understanding that we might come under a revelation that is going to influence in such a way that there is stimulation by revelation that affects the way that we think it affects the way that we talk it affects the way that we dress look i like me some food i guess nobody else does i like some food you know you go out to a restaurant and uh oh you sit down and maybe you study over the menu and you look look at the menu and then you ask the server you say oh hey what should i order and i i think you should i'll tell you what's really good you ought to get the almond crusted mahi mahi with parmesan crumbles and a cherry wine sauce to top it off it's just like man that sounds pretty good right now i could go for some ima with the parmesan incredibles crust and all that sounds pretty good don't it and it starts to have an effect on you go well to the server you're like how is it do you like it oh i've never had it and you look at them and all of a sudden you realize that they're just speaking from education they're not speaking from an experience they haven't tasted it for themselves but i love it when you go to the restaurant oh you can tell if somebody's had it before you say what should i order like oh man i get this i eat this two times every time i come in i reckon you can actually tell they're speaking with some conviction they actually know what they're talking about because they've actually eaten it david said oh taste and see that the lord is good i wonder if there's somebody in the house of god that has actually tasted and seen that the lord is good oh my when you get a revelation of this message when you have taken a bite off of this body word son of man and you've chewed it up and you've digested it oh and you've gotten a little stimulation of revelation oh it does something to your body i'll have what he's having i have what he's having give me a little of that oh you get some brothers after the service they've heard a good word what are you doing they're licking the honey off of one another oh give me some of that i want a little of what he's having oh get a little understanding get a little education no yeah it's good to hear the word but you got to be a doer of the word listen to this quote thank you brother cosman we have time everybody with me the rise in the sun maybe if you you can pull that up paragraph 216. i believe our pastor just went down these lines the rising of the sun paragraph 216 says your body ain't subject to sin no more your desires he said come out here you say shut your mouth oh we got the biggest shot in your mouth my you're an eagle right when the devil comes around when when he starts talking this this gibberish to you and everything what do you say shut your mouth you're an eagle did you ever see how independent an old eagle walks he don't hop like a vulture see to every dead and all the carrion laying on the ground no sir he walks proud shut your mouth oh here is a good dinner over here not for me see my desires has changed my appetite is different for man shall not live on the world a carry-on alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god a genuine quickened eagle lives by that amen oh he he is raised up christ from the grave dwelling you has quickened your mortal body unto his presence you recognize it you are no longer a scavenger you're an eagle i want to take a little bit on that you are no longer a scavenger do you know what a scavenger is a scavenger eats on dead things or decaying things now that is your old nature remember we ministered a while back when the holy ghost comes in the prophet of god uh was given testimony uh to the uh uh i forget the brother's name there in south africa he was given the testimony he said when the holy ghost comes in it burns out the old nature and it's behind you now that old nature behind you is a scavenger but it's wanting to influence you it's wanting to have a position of influence in your life so real quickly when you find yourself feeding on the things of the world scavenger hopping from one thing to the next we we i tell you what we got some we got some digital scavengers if we're ever living in an age where we can hop from this dead decaying dying thing to the next it's this age and if you ever find yourself scrolling or or listening or watching and jumping from this thing to the next thing that is a scavenger nature i wonder if you've ever rolled through the message in the bible like that have you ever just put in parentheses son of man and just walked through the bible in the message oh you're so educated and you work that phone and that computer so well but you can't do it for god you think it's a coincidence we have the table or is that something god gave us do you think it's a coincidence that we can plug in a phrase and search it and find out what thus saith the lord said about it look i tell you what it fixed a lot of problems in the message can somebody say amen there were men going around giving what their understanding of the message was and saying brother branham said this and brother branham said that and having confidence in a man who was charismatic you would take that word or that understanding and say my i wonder that the prophet said that and then blue and behold god gives us the whole message so at the touch of your fingertips you can type in anything you can search it out and you come to find out how you never said that please whatever comes over this pulpit i know i got a full uh support from my pastor said search it out in the message [Music] search it out in the bible but my goodness uh the world has its search engines and boy we just put those to good use why don't you put those that hunger and thirst after right that's your search engine why don't you start searching the search to the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life but there they that testify of the message of the hour the rising of the sun the son of man ministry the mighty angel coming down putting one foot on land and one on sea and loosen the seven seals why don't you search that put that in your search engine you're not a scavenger quit feeding on that nonsense we got to come together church we got real needs and real people in bondage in our church it's going to take all of us together whether prophet god say you want to see somebody you want to see something big you want to see the third pool really do something it takes all of us together what are you doing on your computer at 10 at night 12 at night two in the morning it's a curse are we so blind church to realize we're living in the hour of the coming of the lord we have heard the shout out christ has come to unite himself with the pride and what are we doing i think it's a paradox look up your redemption drawleth hold on look up here no i'm too busy looking down god i think it's a paradox in the hour when any chart should really be looking up your redemption draws an eye we got our heads buried in some information and some education that has nothing to do with where we're going yeah i get on my hobby horse every once in a while and it needs to be said but you're an eagle you don't want the things of the world you're a son and daughter of god you're feasting at a fountain that the world knows nothing about you're drinking it somebody the world knows nothing about your eating hidden manna that the world never know nothing of it for you're an eagle you're quickened up where you can get to it you can't get it down here you got to get it up here you got to be quick and lift it up so it will quicken some people are just satisfied with reading the menu some people are just satisfied up yeah okay it says he it shall quicken your mortal body so i guess if i ever need it it's back there okay you know you go to a restaurant you read the menu you got to place your order you got to come to the house of god you got to read the word you you got to wrap your prayers up in the word of god when you come with expectation why don't we put in our order but a lot of times we just get satisfied with reading the menu elvis back there if i ever need it i know he said it but oh if we can pray for understanding that god would open up the word that would become a part of you and you'd have the revelation of it oh then that changes everything then it has an influence on you in your life look one day one day it's going to be too late one day it's going to be too late you know there's coming a day where where the foolish virgin are going to put in their order it's going to be too late they're going to say yeah i would like to i would like to order me some of that holy ghost what's the server going to say to him sorry kitchen's closed the chef's gone home oh my don't wait for that don't

you think i'm beside my yeah i'm a little stimulated because when you get a little revelation it comes with a little stimulation what happens you start talking funny you start walking funny look i hate to say it all right we're gone now we're off the notes let's have church look i hate to say it but i've been drunk before and you know what i've actually gotten arrested for being publicly intoxicated yeah it's a shame but you know what something had got an influence over my body where i wasn't acting normal i wasn't talking normal and it was obvious to the public so you know what they did they arrested me because i was talking funny i was walking funny and i was acting funny now the prophet of god said that stimulation of revelation he said the way wine makes a natural man act he said revelation does the same thing to a believer what do you think happened to them on the day of pentecost when tongues like fire like a rushing mighty wind came breaking down upon them and they were filled with all he goes oh they started talking different they started acting different they busted out of the door and you know what they were publicly intoxicated oh watch it brother matthew you're talking about being drunk no these men aren't drunk as you suppose but this is that which the prophet joel prophesied i will send my spirit upon them they'll speak in new tongues they'll dream dreams they'll have visions what is it it's the power of the holy ghost is there a church tonight that believes that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you're not afraid of a little stimulation watch out brother matthew you're getting fanatical now well that's true that's true maybe i'll just read what the prophet said oh my where are we at now prophet of god said oh the greatest pleasure i know of is to be prayed up until i can realize that i'm in the presence of god and recognize it i think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the holy ghost seeing that god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it vindicated it ought to give faith to make cripples walk blind see deaf here and dumb speak oh can you smell that church can you hear that what is it brother matthew the chef's cooking up something i think i think your order's being ready i think your order's being cooked oh brother matthew that sounds kind of weird well that's all right i'm drunk it ought to sound weird to the public this day this scripture is fulfilled what are you talking about preacher yeah yeah this day revelations 10 1-7 is fulfilled take the book and eat it up what are you talking about preacher this day this scripture is fulfilled i'm feeding on that word that bread of life the mighty angel that came down out of heaven with an open book in hand and gives it to the bride yeah take this cup drinking all of it there's stimulation by revelation verily verily i send you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than this shall you do search the scriptures stay with me a little longer church we got a little time search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me are you so blind he's not talking about 2 000 years ago it was a parallel the son of man came back again search the scriptures in them you think that you have eternal life and they are today that testify of the word made flesh among you eat this flesh and drink this blood the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life in other words don't you know that i am the word and i am here to make manifest the word that was promised are you i did anybody order something is there somebody here that put in their order and i oh glory to god well somebody ought to get excited and i am here to make manifest the word that was promised oh glory to god somebody ought to get excited i believe that thing you've been believing for all these years it's coming right now into manifestation why because i i am here to manifest the word that was promised what god promised that the messiah would do i am here to confirm it according to the time of life you shall have a son sarah's like who is this guy who is this guy sarah it's me i'm the one that gave the promise get your eyes off the badger skin get your eyes off the flesh there i know i came down and i'm veiling myself in the body but i'm the one that made the promise i'm the one that called called abraham i i'm the one that said number the stars and the sands of the sea i'm the one according to the promised land sarah i'm the one speaking to you is there somebody here that can hear the voice of god and i am here to confirm it why not that pentecostal church tonight then the very works that god promised the church to do we ought to rise on our feet in the name of jesus christ and do it when elijah the old prophet represented christ elijah the old prophet followed him across jordan when he come back he had a double portion and the church followed christ to calvary and the mantle of christ fell down this fell down with the baptism of the holy ghost and jesus said the things that i do shall you do also and even greater than this shall you do more because i go to my father amen where is the god of jesus christ where is the god that made the promise in the bible we need more elisha's we need more believers to be on it oh is there somebody here that's on that word of god well i think i'm just getting ready to start preaching you ever seen an infomercial but wait

and all those kind of things yeah well where do you think i got that the holy ghost gospel is nothing but one great big powerhouse of joy well i could preach there a little while if your house ain't full of one big powerhouse of joy then you got problems why would you live any longer like that what is it is it pride or is that you not wanting to make yourself subject to the word we dealt with that god god called that out the holy ghost gospel is nothing but one great big powerhouse of joy the holy ghost gospel is a perfect intoxication for every man that got the blues you'll take a drink of the gospel of jesus christ and be filled with the holy ghost you are drunk until you leave this world amen joy unspeakable and full of glory there's constant stimulation it's a constant intoxication drunk day and night amen that's the word of god i'll take this cup drink all of it this is the blood of the new testament drink all of it not just a portion of it to wait there's more keep drinking keep eating oh there's power in this drink you know you can go out there if you want to get intoxicated they got something on the forgive me for saying it's the truth say 12 on there then they have other ones that's 20 30 they call it proof then they got stuff that's 100 proof well you know as that life was sprouting up down through the church ages it was like 20 proof 40 proof it was a portion of the word until the fullness of the word came it was a hundred proof a thousand octane oh get a hold of that it'll set your world on fire it'll change the way you act it'll change the way you see it'll open up an understanding to you it'll lift you up in heavenly places it'll quicken your mortal body it'll so stimulate you with revelation oh there's power in it power to forgive you power to cleanse you power to wash you power to heal you there's power in the blood come on somebody say power there's power in the blood there is a power here in the building tonight to give you whatever you have need of no more condemnation free from sin free from the cares of the world no condemnation why to them that have been by one spirit baptized into the body there the blood of the lamb has been applied the god of heaven has accepted you his life in you and you are sons and daughters of god your character is god's character what is it a little pushover no no sir god is a god of judgment he is a god of correct it must be on that line nothing else will do that's the kind of character you are because you're the character of your father see you are the genes of them the spirit covenant this is a little excerpt from the quote we opened with would be about five more minutes the spirit covenant will i make with the people and it displays his power he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also no more spectators no more wallflowers it's time to serve your purpose it's time to take god at his word it's time to quit being a scavenger it's time to get your house in order it's time to quit living in bondage there's a power here to set you free when pride tells you not tonight shut your mouth devil when pride tells you i'll wait for so-and-so to get back shut your mouth devil we have a divine promise if you're battling something we cast that devil out and you have a divine promise if you've repented of your sins you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you can receive the gift of the holy ghost while we're preaching the word you can receive the holy ghost by the laying of hands you can receive the holy ghost why don't you receive the holy ghost it's a promise to you the prophet of god says this make some lanes out there i'm about to take off now oil typifies the spirit and wine simulates a stimulation of revelation oh i like to run all over the place wonder i didn't wake up the neighborhood when the lord showed me that stimulation of revelation see oil and wine in the bible is associated together always i got the coordinates on it and look there's a string of them like that where wine and oil goes together all the time when the truth of the promised word of god has been truly revealed to his saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation glory i feel it right now stimulated with joy shouts see when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon the natural man well go ahead and criticize it when somebody gets all loopy acting funny i'm just saying what the prophet said because the revelation it has the same effect upon him that wine does upon the natural man because when the revelation has been given of the truth of god and the true believer filled with oil and the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself on normally right glory the congregation rejoices they're screaming and they're shouting and the prophet of god says see that's what's the matter with them now that's right makes them behave themselves unseemly now if you want a scripture for this just start reading acts 2 oh glory to god they were gathered there in the upper room what did jesus tell and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endured with power from on high look just stay there until the promise of my father is quickened stay there until the promise becomes a reality stay there until god interprets his promised word by bringing it to pass stay in his promised word until it becomes life in you his spirit the musicians will come once they got it they were stimulated by revelation they were under the influence of the holy ghost they weren't scared no more they come out talking funny acting funny completely transformed they were publicly intoxicated by the holy ghost the prophet goes on to say look there has to be an effect of the quickening power in your life that brings forth a change revelation changes you stimulation of revelation makes you act different the reason why you're struggling with the same things look look if you're a son or daughter of god he's going to rebuke and chasten you be thankful for that this is not condemnation because there's no condemnation to them that in christ jesus this is the drill sergeant saying hey we're going to war this is how we do things we got to fight a battle so so what are they what do they call insanity if you keep doing something over and over and you get the same results that's insanity right but they say something like that if you keep running in the same thing over and over and over and you're not living an overcoming life that's the grace of god showing you allowing you to come to the trial allowing you to come to the battle showing you that look my son my daughter i actually have more for you there's an opening of your understanding and a revelation that i can give you that will so stimulate you that'll make you so intoxicated by the word of the hour by my flesh that i give you to eat and by my blood that i give you to drink that you'll be so stimulated with revelation you'll start talking different you'll start acting different you'll start walking different you'll start dressing different you'll start testifying to your neighbors and to your boss and to everybody around you while that's what happens to drunk people everybody in the town just knows that they're the town drunk i think somebody ought to get so stimulated with the message of the hour that everybody in the town knows that you're a message believer oh but brother matthew they'll shut us down well that's all right they tried to shut the apostles down they were scared because why they didn't want to get shut down they had actually taken their captain and crucified him but when the life that was in the captain came back on them they didn't care anymore you can't shut me up anymore i got a story to tell that same jesus who you crucified oh hallelujah the same jesus that struck me down on the road to damascus oh glory to god he told me to rise up paul i got something for you to do rise up right i got something for you to do i got a testimony for you to live out before lady will see you let's all stand well here's my here's my inspiration oh i love this quote right here stay with me for a moment then i can see simon because he had the keys you know now wait a minute boys this scripture has something to say about this he never told us just how many days to wait he said you stay there until you stay there until joel's prophecy comes to pass until isaiah's prophecy is vindicated for with stammering lips and with other tongues will i speak to this people and this is the refreshment this is the refreshment does anybody want a refreshment maybe you've lost the joy of your salvation maybe you've gotten cold god's dealing with hearts right now god's speaking to you why don't you let him deal with your heart and this is the refreshment this is the wine that's poured out what is wine in the bible refreshments this is the refreshments that comes from the presence of the lord see it's got to be scriptural now see so you see wine represents stimulation of revelation and when the holy ghost fell everybody look inwardly don't look on on others right now you see wine represents stimulation of revelation when the holy ghost fell and they seen the fire of god fall upon them my that began to stimulate them and the first thing you know they got so stimulated till the people actually thought they were drunk but they were stimulated by revelation oh god if you've ever been stimulated by revelation so we could tell some testimonies here it is god's vindicated revelation made plain to them they was happy about it god promised it here it was revealed to them and vindicated them here was a man standing there saying this is that this is it and there it was being vindicated by the same size that we have today there is stimulation by revelation they really had it now i want to tell you there's a presence of god here right now that's moving amongst the people look church we're writing another book of acts that is not something for the future because the same life that is in the vine is in the branches he said i am the vine you are the branches the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and life oh help me i'm looking for a place to close but god's dealing with hearts right now why don't you open up your heart and receive it why don't you confess that you're not living where you should be living why don't you confess that you know what i've been coming to church not not to man but in your heart to god and say lord i've been coming here long enough and i've been blending in but i want stimulation of revelation i realize that i'm not acting right in my home i realize that i'm not acting right with my friends i realize that this spirit that's supposed to come upon me and the believer and quicken the mortal body has not happened in my life don't be condemned that means it's here to quicken you just stimulate you and open up your understanding oh praise this wonderful name what are we playing [Music] what you unravel me with a melody [Music] i know it's a wednesday night but let's all do with your heart [Music] i [Music] i just want to say this as we take it just lightly play [Music] the world's going one way [Music] it's a time of decision church you can't be a scavenger anymore it's too late an hour the world's going off into complete apostasy complete a sanity they're under an influence of the devil they're under the influence of the god of this evil age but there is an influence of the holy ghost there is an influence that the bride of jesus christ is under that's taken us beyond the camp of tradition that's taken us beyond the camp of reasoning that has taken us beyond the camp of what we can figure out i want to invite somebody here that was honest in their heart to look at the word of god and say you know what i realize that there is a stimulation of revelation to change my life that i have not received like i see there in the word and you're willing to lay down all your pride you're willing to lay it all down and say you know what lord i'm gonna lift my hands tonight and ask lord jesus you give me that stimulation by revelation i i see the world pressing one way but oh god i know you're pressing another way like that great magnet that went over those scraps of metal lord my life is shaking i don't know what i'm gonna do i but i i know your word's true but it just seems like i haven't been able to come up higher i want to tell you the magnets it's it's passing over you right now why don't you just look up to him why don't you just lift up your hands and say oh god here i am lord take me now i surrender all i surrender all to you oh may i be attracted to your word that i might receive that stimulation of revelation or if you need prayer if you want to come for prayer if you put in an order don't leave without getting what you asked for you unravel me [Music] if a melody oh hallelujah oh glory to god oh this is your night [Music] yeah god was fishing for you he said i'll make you fishers of men god
