[Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good evening i'm david mcgarry i'm the pastor here and i will not get involved in your meeting very much but we certainly welcome you and i just in my heart for this meeting uh it was the desire of the young people here to have a meeting and we all know that we've been through covid and this shut down and that shut down and everything but you can't shut down the spirit of god and you can't shut down people who are hungering and thirsting after god and i i expect this to be a very special meeting we call it young people meeting but i i'm not going to refer to this as a young people's meeting i'm going to refer to it as a young soldiers meeting and our invite to you i believe most of you i can look out and look at you you spirit filled your you made choices to come here and a scripture come to my heart that is very common with all of us and it says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink deadly things it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this set of scriptures is what we refer to as the great commission and when i look at you sitting here i remember i guess now 50 some years ago 54 years ago when i was 18 years old and i heard the gospel and i took this commission at the age of 18 and this became my goal for my life and i like these meetings as you sit here and listen to these men preach the gospel to you because they're preaching the gospel to you because they have a desire in their heart but i hope that personally you would take these meetings each one of you as an invite to join the commission an invite to join the army and to go to work for the kingdom of god that these words might settle into your heart that you would go into your workplaces you would go into your schools that you would go into your families you would go into your neighborhoods and you would go into your churches and that you'd be on fire for the kingdom of god to carry out this commission because if the lord would tarry another 20 years i probably won't be here but somebody's got to carry on this commission somebody's got to go tell the lost somebody's got to lay hands on the sick somebody's got to cast out the devils and you're that people and so i hope as you hear brother john i know he loves you and he encourages you and you hear the word of god speak to your heart just take every word that the spirit moves on your heart as god recruiting you into his army so you may not want to get drafted but if you come to this meeting you are going to be drafted into the army of the living god amen you're going to be given a a weapon to use you're going to be given a commission you're going to be given orders and let's pray that the holy spirit just stirs you because there's people that it lives that can't be touched by anybody but you nobody can take your place so i i really am proud of the caliber of the young people that came out uh you i can tell by looking at you you you're great believers so i believe that god's got to step higher for us so we're happy that you've come here to join with our youth to seek closer to the lord to seek what his will might be to get him to speak to our hearts and give us direction how that we can serve him better so let us stand as we turn the service over to brother billy and i'd like to say the opening prayer for you this evening and ask that god would richly bless you let's about our heads together our heavenly father lord each of these fine christian soldiers that you had in your heart and in your mind before the world ever was hung in space before there ever was a star you saw each of them father lord and you had good works foreordained unto each of them that they should walk in them father that they would serve you for your good pleasure lord i ask that this weekend be a weekend that you move upon the heart that each believer here this weekend would see their value in the great plan of god father that they would see that they have a work to do and that nobody else can do the job that you have set forth for them to do that the good works that you foreordained for each of them father is for them as members in particular father and lord may that peace come into each heart father that they know that they are a part of the great and wonderful plan of god father may your spirit move father beyond the realms of emotion and beyond the realms of our senses and consciousness but father may that still small voice speak to that chamber in our heart and father may we go from this meeting saying it was good to assembled with the saints it was good to hear from god it was good to receive quickening power it was good to go forth to work in the harvest father bless these workers i pray in jesus precious name amen god bless we're going to turn the service over to billy he's our host for this meeting if you need anything if there's anything that we can do for you ask billy amen god bless you

certainly excited to be in his presence you know i was just thinking about these meetings and one thing that came to my heart as our pastor said there is never anybody come in the presence of god and remain the same and i thought about it i said we know god is going to be here because his word is going to be here he promised with two or three i gather under my name i'll be in the midst and then i said if i come in that presence i don't want to miss anything whatever i have need off i want to bring it before him in the during this meetings to make sure that i get it amen i trust that so your

these services for you to come so don't disappoint us lord we love to see one another but oh god to see you to have your presence that's why we're just lingering a little bit lord because just five minutes in your presence just a few minutes in your presence [Music] just makes everything right make all the wrongs right tonight let us come up into heavenly places and fellowship lord with you [Music] oh we love you lord we love you we thank you god oh thank you jesus go with us now down this journey in jesus name amen amen are y'all allowed to shake hands with somebody fist hallelujah shake hands with somebody hallelujah we've had enough fist bumping and waving in the last year we might as well give me some skin you know hallelujah give me some skin hallelujah hallelujah don't worry we're all going to be changed hallelujah i'm just going to let you have your seats for a moment and do something just a little bit different i mean sometimes we read the scriptures thank you brother steve thank you musicians sometimes we read the scriptures right away and go right into the word but tonight i'm just going to talk to you just before we read the scriptures is that okay and lord laid these things on our hearts uh to speak already days ago what we're going to be speaking tonight and tomorrow night and sunday morning so this isn't just something we got this afternoon this is something the lord prepared for you days before don't you love the lord and i'm not going to start saying your names and the people we love and know but god loves all of you amen hallelujah a couple weeks years ago we were here and it was all packed out and there was no room but now we have some air to breathe a little bit and that's good amen it's really good and some from africa let me know they're going to be streaming right now and from new zealand and other places all over the world europe and places you know we've become global it's become a global village and i know some don't like that but the lord loves it so you know we might as well get used to it amen we're not all from the same local church but we are from one one body amen and god bless you tonight and we welcome you and i think it's brother trevor's son's birthday tonight will he stand happy birthday god bless you god bless you i think it's a couple more people's birthdays but i don't know your names how to pronounce your name so happy birthday i think brother trevor is going to be speaking in the morning after 10 o'clock is that right brother matthew over at the gym 10 o'clock so if you all want to be there and hear brother trevor that'd be wonderful i plan to be there and i'm looking forward to it i wrote some pages of notes on the airplane i'd like to share with you and um you know we're all together on a friday night we're not downtown at a pub or at a at a movie somewhere we're in the presence of the lord so we can share and talk to one another from our hearts but this weekend in dallas we've not come together this weekend to discuss the weather we're not here to talk about a virus or a global pandemic in fact to be honest with you i'm kind of sick and tired of hearing about the virus and the globe seems like almost every service it gets some sort of credit i think that ought to end and we just ought to say so we're not going to give credit to no virus i'm not here to discuss national politics with you or your local politics or church politics i don't like that anyway i don't think you do either i'm not here to discuss your local or the regional sports teams they're pretty good but i'm not here to speak about the texas rangers or the dallas cowboys or lsu or florida state or the dallas mavericks or the houston texans i heard some were here from houston just wave your hand a little bit are you here yet tonight or okay they're com god bless you we're not going to discuss the houston texans or the louisville cardinals or the trevor might tomorrow but tonight we're not going to or the new york yankees no soccer team gets any glory no hockey team or or a barbie doll team whatever you're whatever we're into we're not here to talk about those natural things we're not here to go shopping we're not here just to socialize i think since the announcement they bumped up the number so everyone's invited to stay after for the food isn't that wonderful i think that's wonderful brother david and sister leslie invited us all to come and just want you to be able to feed from god's presence and feed from um just being young people in the message that can love the lord together are you thankful this church invited us thank you very much and you know we're not here we're not interested in their social media accounts either and you're not interested in mine we're not here for the preacher we're not here for the singers we're not here to cause trouble or to cause confusion we're here to enjoy jesus christ and it's just great to be with one another this is like heaven to us and we recognize that each one of you are different and each one of you are special i wrote these things down so i'm taking the time to read we're all unique and we're all kind of odd all of us are but we want you to be able to receive we want you to be healed if you're sick this is a good place to just be healed this is a good place to be delivered sitting right in your seat you can be filled with the holy ghost you can be so taken over with the power of god just five minutes in his presence could change our lives forever and we're gonna spend five minutes together at least tonight so let's just be changed do we all agree with that this weekend we're going to be blessed and touched by the lord we're all free people amen so we want to walk in that liberty i don't want you to worry about anything and i don't want you to be nervous about anything god's got it all in control do you believe that these aren't just little phrases this is the truth we're sons and daughters of god and we're all in a journey and we're all at different uh stages of our growth and our experience and by now we should have matured to just respect one another and have patience for one another as we grow together because whatever we have in need of is in jesus do we believe that it is in jesus name so we just encourage you to surrender just yield these are big secrets just be sensitive to the lord tonight be listening for a personal word from god and be conscious though that god is dealing with other people too and we all take it different brother billy we all take it different when god talks to us some of us get quiet some of us might respond loudly some might um just listen some might just sit there and cry but they're soaking it in so we want to respect that how god deals with others because we're a body and we move together i don't want you to leave here with brother john's spirit i want you to have god's nature and his character these are some of the greatest times of your life i think i've said that before but these are some of the greatest times of your life times and meetings like this these are sacred sands of our experience and i really appreciate it we believe that god pre-plans and god pre-arranges things do you believe that even tonight has been pre-arranged by god these are opportunities for us to draw closer to him and to one another draw closer to god and draw closer to one another i just want to say this not to be stern but making fun of others will not be tolerated hello being a bully is sin so as young people you know it's good for us not to stand for arrogance and pride and selfishness we live in a me me me and an iphone and i this and i that age but when we come to the house of god eternal life is living for others so special meetings and church is like a hospital in the past year or two we've we've been uh reminded of that with other young people services that we've had and so we want these meetings to be a place of healing for you and where wounds can be healed amen you don't have to be embarrassed nobody here has to be embarrassed we're all trying to find ourselves so it's not just for the young people to try to find themselves or god's will for their lives older people are trying to find god's will if you listen to uh sirs is this the time the last ten minutes of the service i mean i texted that to a senior pastor today i said the last seven to ten minutes of that service says it all brother branham was a prophet how many believe that he's a major prophet and he just got done speaking about six dreams and visions and he at the end of that service said well i'm going to go out to tucson then i'm going to go up to anchorage i'm going to go to denver colorado he didn't know where he was going hello so stop trying to nail down people and say well what are you going to do the rest of your life or where are you going we don't know where we're going abraham you know sarah believers we're going in the rapture well what are you going to do for a career who are you going to marry you know god knows all those things but brother branham had the holy ghost and he was being led by god but he didn't know everything and we know he went out and met angels and and got a sword in his hand but he had to walk down off that mountain i was just there a few weeks ago in tucson and you know brother branham received that sword into his hand but he had to walk down off that mountain he had a family and he had a life he didn't live there forever and you and i do too we come to services like this we're going to hear the god's word it's going to be very personal tonight but we got to leave here we got to go back to life this is our life but we got to go back to reflecting life so none of us have it all together i'm just saying making some comments here it's nothing but the truth none of us have it all together none of us know it all so stop trying to be a know-it-all you don't have it all together you know it looks like preachers or people look like they're always in the victory where we all got our cross tonight we just all happen to be in the building or in a service bearing our cross we can do it happily and joyfully or we can just get a spirit on us and be like the world i just choose to be happy none of us are better than anybody else nobody's higher than nobody else no matter what your skin color is or your national language we're all the same this is some announcements we're making we're all in need we're all in need so be vulnerable be willing to be open stop trying to hide behind a facade and you know any of you that know brother john i see some from seattle karina and others you know that we're different and we're a unique speaker i don't like to get up way in the clouds somewhere i like to speak to you from our hearts and just let the holy spirit talk to you we were born and raised in this message we've had the privilege to have a believing father and mother that's probably streaming right now a family that was raised in this message uh born and raised in jeffersonville and i'm not ashamed of our prophet i'm not ashamed to stand with him and i'm not ashamed to stand with you all of you we love you god loves you and i was thinking brother billy brother matthew on the airplane coming here i was thinking how much god must love you to even talk to you like this and to be able to create these times the reason that i mention about my past or our history is because when we minister it's coming from another perspective and from another position of one that as a youth and as a young person and as a young adult our whole lives has been caught up with this and so i think that's um not all ministries can reach young people we probably should just turn off the internet brother parks but not all ministers and ministries can reach young people not all gifts even good gifts have love and passion for youth and all ministers are unique and most definitely i'm not a big minister i'm a real small person we don't claim to be a big person but the trevor is tomorrow he you listen to brother trevor tomorrow but i'm just a small gift in god's body but we do have a deep love for the youth of the message i'm not an intellectual orator we just want to be with jesus this weekend we want to give you an opportunity and i don't know if anyone here is aware of this tonight i'm just going to say this before we read our scripture today is friday may the 14th and that's 40 days since easter easter was april the 4th today is 40 days we are 40 days since easter and uh when jesus was here and rose from the dead on easter it was on the 40th day when jesus ascended up into heaven how many recognize that last sunday was the was the fifth uh week in and this is friday it's for it's the 40th day today was the day on a friday that jesus ascended up and i just think that's something that for us to remember that jesus was making himself known his disciples and increasing their faith to believe that's what he's doing tonight he's still with his disciples trying to get our faith to believe and on the 40th day on a friday is jesus tarried with them and then he told them to go terry in an upper room for 10 you remember that and when the day of pentecost which is 50 that's 50. that's when acts chapter 2 took place the day of pentecost so let's be conscious tonight let's be aware of the season we're in we're living in bible times so if they had their 40 days and jesus ascended up we have our time this is your time amen so this is our time and as we stand to our feet we'll turn right to the scripture god bless you for your patience and i'll cut down on my time so our opening comments as part of the service luke chapter 23 the last year or 14 months hasn't been normal for none of us and so we're coming to the lord to offer ourselves at this season because we're getting ready for the rapture how many want to make heaven your home and be together so heavenly father as you would sit around the table with your family come talk to us tonight may the presence of jesus christ come into this room may you minister to every heart keep our attention and our focus uh alerted on you lord may every single person have their needs met in jesus name remember us tonight thank you lord amen luke 23 verse 32 we're going to step back to another friday this is friday isn't it we're going to go back to another friday in the scripture it was a dark day actually it started early in the morning late at night last night was the communion service and today was a long day for jesus and uh it's nearing the afternoon time it's be it's coming to 12 o'clock in between 12 o'clock and three o'clock and so uh if there was a webcam or a video tonight we'd be we would be looking at calvary and jesus had already bore his cross up the hill and we see in verse 32 there were also two other male factors they were like criminals and they were males led with him to be put to death verse 33 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary let's all say calvary there they crucified him and the male factors one on the right hand and the other on the left then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do you know sometimes as young people we need to hear that forgive them forgive me they know not what they do these were the people that had crucified jesus and they parted his raiment and cast lots and the people stood beholding now this is embarrassing jesus was naked naked in front of the church naked in front of the young people his mother mary was there and john but also his scoffers and mockers people that didn't love jesus were making fun and deriding him and this is the picture on that friday people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him they were yelling out they were screaming saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ or anointed the chosen of god and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews because pilate's wife had already been speaking to pilate saying don't have anything to do with this man and she had suffered all night y'all know all this right it wasn't a very nice friday this is another friday in may verse 39 and this is where i want you to really get a part of the scene as it opens one of the male factors which were hanged in matthew and mark it talks about them being thieves the thieves which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us this was the the guy over here on this side here's jesus in the middle you're looking at the cross so this guy over here he's deriding jesus and he's saying things and the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god see now are in the same condemnation that's this thief over here if you read in matthew it says both of them were doing this at the beginning both of them didn't understand both of them were saying these things but something got a hold of one of them amen and he's talking now to the other one these are their last breaths of life and they're talking on the cross to one another and the man over here is rebuking the other thief over here saying in verse 40 he was rebuking him saying dost not thou fear god see now are in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom this is his last words and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise today shalt thou be with me in paradise and it was about the sixth hour that's twelve o'clock noon and there was a darkness over all the earth till the ninth hour that's three o'clock p.m and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst god bless you you can have your seats tonight on this 40th day since easter we're taking our title tonight and i want every person to listen real closely from luke 23 42 three words lord remember me lord remember me i'm going to take the whole service and preach on that in the lord great i want you to forget about everybody else and i want these three words to be your prayer this friday night is for you we're just going to dig down a little bit deeper into three words and how it can change a life forever but it changed this man's life for eternity you all still got the picture we're looking on the top of mount calvary where there's three crosses brother branham said most people see three but there was four he said judas went out and hung himself he committed suicide right he did what a lot of people in the message would do when they do when they betray the lord they just say oh i'm embarrassed it's all over there's no future for me he went out and committed suicide he hung himself on a sycamore tree brother branham said most people see calvary they see three crosses but there was really four judas he hung himself don't do that young people i'm speaking spiritually in this time of great darkness on this friday when it seems like the sun is covered over when it seems like things in your life or in your situation might seem very dark on this friday the lord laid this on brother john's heart days ago to let tonight just be simple three words lord remember me this came from a man that had never been to a youth meeting he didn't go to church he wasn't a good person he never got baptized i'm trying to dig down deep here's a man that didn't live for christ he's a thief if you want to go back to isaiah 53 the bible says prophesying of this event in verse 12 that i will divide him a portion with the great speaking of jesus and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors jesus was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many let's all say many the whole world even the sins of every person that's in this building tonight jesus bore your sin hallelujah all the young people in the message and i think this is a weekend for the young people so i'm going to focus there it's just like if you have a car and you have a transmission problem you don't go to the quick lube place the guy that this is minimum wage or the girl that's working there to change your oil you need somebody that's trained in transmissions if you have an oil you know if you have an engine problem you don't go you know to somebody that does the the glasses in the front of the vehicle is that right you go to people that are trained to focus in tonight i'm going there god's honing in the word is sharp and powerful coming right to all of our situations and it's causing there to be a prayer from your heart back to god lord remember me every person in this room is better off than this man that i'm talking about tonight he's dirty he's filthy he's on a cross the bible says jesus was numbered with the transgressors that there was transgression in his life there was transgression in the other thief that was railing on him and people that were spitting on jesus and don't forget that jesus was so uh burdened and marred beyond any uh his visage was changed he didn't look good he wasn't going to the mall on a friday night with the young people looking all good and happy and all dressed good his robe was one of shame i mean drunken soldiers are bartering and throwing dice for his garment down here and jesus is naked that's a horrible friday it's not a friday that any of us would put on your status but this is a night for the believers we had to have that night we have to have that friday we had to have that friday and then 40 days later jesus was with his disciples for days showing himself to thomas and peter and other of the disciples to make sure they were going to believe him and he ascended up and they waited for 10 days in an upper room and on the day of pentecost they were all filled with the holy ghost how many would you love that tonight just the holy spirit would just come and just baptize all of us just right in this church service just wherever you're at that's our pentecost but i'm going back to this condition because the bible says he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors tonight's service might just be for one person it might be for five or ten we're a little less than two hundred maybe here but this is what the lord laid on my heart days ago i wrote it down this is our title for tonight lord remember me it's a cry that comes from the inside of a person lord remember my situation and this man is hanging on the cross his last gasp his last words never went to an altar never was in a prayer line never was baptized but in the last few seconds of his life he recognized that's my only savior that's my only way out of this that is the answer is the man in the middle it wasn't the politics of jerusalem it wasn't the social media account which was already dead he didn't he didn't have his cell phone there saying pray for me thumbs up you know pray for me i'm in a dark hour that had all been stripped away he was in pain he's in his la his thoughts are on all his misdeeds and things they're saying come something came out of the innermost part of his being to this man in the middle remember me tonight that's what we need to just hold sacred all of this lord remember me and then if you really want to stretch it a little further remember us remember here in dallas fort worth texas it's like the lord rolls out the red carpet of his word and he gives special attention to us we ought to say thank you lord all of us as young people need to stop taking it for granted that we got people that love us and give us food and provide a place we're not out under the tree somewhere we're not in in the middle of a desert we're not gasping on a cross for our last breath can everyone breathe tonight thank you jesus thank you lord this isn't going to be a normal service all right remember me amen i just think it's fantastic that the lord jesus think about this and his last minutes of his life wasn't so selfish but he was thinking of others and his last gasp of breath for someone that did not deserve it probably hadn't even prayed or you know been to the church he might have stolen from the good church people but he's praying a prayer or saying some words lord remember me and jesus turned to him and said verily i say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in paradise somebody say praise the lord i mean and maybe i'll get into that tomorrow night when i speak on youth with passion youth with fire there was a place in the old testament that all the dead believers went to when they died and that was called paradise they couldn't go into the presence of god and they couldn't go into heaven because jesus hadn't died on the cross so they went into a kind of a holding place brother branham talked about that that's where you know daniel and sarah and abraham and enoch and all the you know all the old testament believers they went into a place called paradise and i'm not going to go into that right now but to maybe tomorrow night all of a sudden somebody comes knocking on the door and comes busting into the room it's this man i'm talking about he's the last one that made it i mean the last of the last he comes walking into a room and looking around a bunch of holy people abraham and sarah daniel and shadrach meshach and abednego that made us stand for christ and he thought what am i doing in this room how'd i get in this room who made me worthy and the last man that went into the regions of the lost was the other man on this side what they didn't recognize the man in the middle could be so close to us tonight the very answer or the very thing you're desiring could be so close to you and even if you can't reach there physically it could just be something that comes out of your heart and your words remember me that could touch the heart of god and literally transform your whole life how many believe the bible when jesus said today shalt thou be with me in paradise how many believe he made it did he deserve hell this man that's hanging over here did he deserve hell we all came lost in iniquity even if you're raised in a message home a message church and have good family or whatever we're all lost [Music] so tonight i'd just like to dig deep into this lord remember me lord let's all say lord when you say that you are recognizing his deity he is god you are approaching a person that is our lord jesus christ he's not a nba basketball star he's not a top 10 instagram follower he's not a hollywood actress this is our lord jesus christ lord it wasn't pilate it wasn't one of them roman soldiers have mercy on me and get me down off this cross this man was speaking to the real person and i trust this weekend we can get real with ourselves real with one another like wouldn't it be fantastic if we just forgot about everybody else and we really didn't care what other people thought about us we can look down the road and look down and the bench and kind of get influenced you know i've been in services maybe you have where the preacher has been preaching to preachers and it's like well there's you know 100 or 200 other people here you know they're bashing people here there and everywhere it's like when are they going to preach the gospel i'm preaching the gospel i'm speaking to you about this person of the lord jesus christ this is not the president we're not talking to the president tonight we're not talking to the mayor or congress they're probably not going to help you anyway is that right friends we need more than you know some supplement check from the government to get us through these times we need the power of god [Applause] we've got jesus here we're talking about [Music] this is not a coach or a manager or your employer you're talking to we're not addressing we're not admiring just some person like that of the world or a teacher or a professor that you might have as a young person this is not a mother you're not crying out for mother brother branham was a 14 year old young man shot in the legs and blood is going everywhere and he he's falling falling falling down and he cried out for his mother and he said there was no mother there he cried out for his daddy my daddy there was no daddy there i'm not speaking fear tonight this is reality tonight when we say lord remember me this is more than your father more than your mother it's more than your auntie or your uncle or some family member this is jesus some of you need to look away from the other things maybe the groaning and the crowd and some woman over here some boy just threw a rock at you some crow is coming down and pecking at your eyes you need to get your eyes away from those it's distractions these are the last few minutes of your life we need to turn tonight remember it was the man over here it was the man to his right that he jesus turned to him so let's look to jesus lord amen it's more than a preacher it's more than a deacon or an elder trying to reach out and touch them or if i could have their cell number brother if i could just have your number can i get your number and text you i've got a need i've been to camps i've been to special services i've been to meetings but i need to talk to to someone that really knows me and i want him to remember me who is that person i believe it's all the same person tonight it's our lord jesus christ he's the main one can i just for about 60 seconds can we all rejoice in the lord jesus christ he's the main one hallelujah he's the one with all the answers he's the one in charge of the universe he's the one who knows the future he knows your future just as well as he knows the past just as he knows the present he's god and he doesn't change he's god he knows the future he knows the past just as good as the future or the present he's our lord i'm we're talking to him tonight let's not make it all complicated only jesus really satisfies when it's all been said and done only jesus satisfies our soul has anybody here found that to be true when you reach the bottom you'll come back to jesus so i say lord remember me this is for every person i don't know who it's for so i'm just going to speak it like it's for for you every person and it's for someone else just let them be pulling it in soaking it in we've driven here for miles we flew on airplanes lord remember me it might be shocking some of you that brother john would be so simple lord remember me remember is i'm a member remember i'm a member of your body i'm your son i'm your daughter this man we're talking about tonight didn't know all this what i'm telling you a lot of you've been raising the message or you heard a lot of things a lot of sermons have y'all heard a lot of sermons this guy over here he's no good he's a transgressor he never was baptized you say well did he have the holy ghost i'm not here to talk about that it was before pentecost but he made it into paradise so he made it in there with abraham and enoch that walked with god here comes the man on the cross sarah and ruth and all you good people esther all you beautiful ladies here comes a man that just the last few minutes tonight you might have lived for satan and been a slave to hell your whole life tonight is an opportunity for you to say lord remember me you might think you're a good person you might have it all like kind of in a row you know how to sing the songs and dress the part and be in the act i know of ministers that's been in prayer lines and people that's been in you know great services and people having fantastic blowout services and there's people that know those young people and how they're living privately and they know somewhere we're missing the mark somewhere we we got to live we got to live and we got to have services where we're living so that we're not just you know one way in church and one way when the anointing is falling and living another life we're trying to bring that together tonight and let it be a cry out of your heart remember me lord jesus you know my private life i'm addressing you lord jesus as my father in headship i'm honoring you lord lord remember me i want to experience you we want to love you more how many would love the lord to love him more boy this is real simple isn't it so everybody ought to get it being raised in the message i just you know there came a time when you just feel like i want to love you more i want to love your word more i want to love your word more than the things of the world give me a love for this message that's greater than anything in the world it's just from your heart you're speaking to him lord i'm speaking to you like a father i want to love you more i want to know you in your power i don't want to know all about you i want to know you that's life young people it's not to know about him to know all the things and yet to miss jesus lord remember me i i pray tonight that the lord jesus would remember every single one of you in fact i believe it was days ago when he laid this on my heart it was like a missile he was coming right down to your heart he was already preparing to let you know he knows everything he's just trying to get you and i to respond back the same and say remember me i know that you know all about me i want to participate with you lord i don't want to be a spectator amen i don't want to be a spectator and looking on i'm encouraging you tonight to engage be connected with christ plug into the word this is jesus we're talking about and finally lord remember me lord remember me as personal even tonight sitting right here you might not think you need him you might not you might think everything is all good i'm good you might be able to drive you might be able to do fun things but you let something happen like a young man some few days ago driving and just driving so fast and just drove a little bit over the edge of the the asphalt and got into the loose gravel and just invite and tonight he's no longer alive this friday night he's not breathing all right they buried him in the ground last saturday and this is amazing as ministers you know it's amazing how somebody can be alive and lifting their hands and they can be going and passionate and let's go and in less than a you could be putting them down into the ground ashes to ashes dust to death as i saw it just the other day as someone shared with me and i saw a video clip i think it was africa somewhere and they were just you know putting shovels of dirt on the casket it's all over brother billy like we can be fancy we can talk we can eat food we can love life we can laugh we can say it's all good how you doing tonight oh good but when it really comes down to where the rubber meets the road we want to make sure whether it's family or friends and somebody in the church when they're shoveling in a little shovel full of dirt that it falls on your casket that we can have some confidence come on friends i mean give us enough something to put you on the other side because i can guarantee you that preacher that takes your service can't put you in heaven you've already lived your life you already made your decision you lived your youth you were strong once you had it you had words i don't see any wheelchairs here tonight brother matthew brother jim i don't see no crutches unless they're under the seat y'all look like a pretty healthy bunch you know when brother branham had meetings are we doing okay brother jackson we're doing okay when brother branham had meetings the whole front section was full of stretchers cuts wheelchairs there were smells in the church because people had all kinds of diseases and blood they were trying to cover up their sides because they had blood some were sexual um diseases they had because they had ran around but there was something called the word that went forth and only believe that was trying to create an atmosphere that whoever's in that service there could be three words come from their heart that would have the ability to change their life say what are you talking about brother john lord remember me you see me you know me and they got us off of stretchers where sister sharapov lives down in tacoma years ago when brother branham was down there in tacoma and there's pictures and everything all around the platform as cots and all kinds of people with needs and troubles they were like in the front today if we've got a problem or a need we don't want nobody to know about it you know we dress the part we get it all together we come to church something's changed over the years i'm just starting to feel comfortable amen you know back then they like came with their needs all out there you know it's all out there brother today you know it seems like we want to cover it all up we don't want nobody to know is that right in fact brother john knows this to be true there he would go right down the aisle and he'd start saying you sister hears you got cancer and you got this in this trouble and you got that how many knows he'd go right down and there were serious needs you got tb you got tumors you got this in your life he'd go right one right and this wasn't small things today i wonder if the lord would go right now it wouldn't be things like that we can see you look healthy you look strong it's moved into another level it's moved into mental issues and mental strains and troubles where it's hard to focus for 20 minutes all the add and this and that and problems and issues in life and satan's trying to throw you into some mental strain that can be worse than a physical strength and if you've got a physical issue it's more obvious but you got something that can be hidden you can cover that over you can kind of mask that say i got it all together and it just might be about ready to crash i pray tonight that you and i would live enough of our lives for christ that there would be enough evidence to put me into heaven i don't need a preacher or a pastor some person to say brother john this sister so and though this let there be enough evidence to say she loved the lord he loved the lord i could see the holy ghost on that person brother branham said i talk to a person for two minutes and tell whether they have the holy ghost i got that here two minutes and he said and you can too so we need to stop playing games we're talking about eternity we're we're talking about a man that is like fixed on a cross saying lord remember me why is it so hard for us to say that why is it so hard tonight i'm not asking you to speak russian or swahili or spanish we can't even talk english sometimes but i know i can't like we're not god's not gonna ask us our grades of our english or our s.a.t scores he's not going to ask us what's in our bank accounts and this isn't in my notes by the way i'm leaving my notes for a few minutes he's not going to ask you know did you have a lot of pimples or did you know was your face pretty clean you know did you eat ice cream or did you take drugs you know what i mean come on did you drink coffee or did you drink water you know we did all into all this stuff tonight we just need to say lord remember us lord you see us down here in dallas texas let there be a voice coming out of this little this little building tonight to the lord jesus up into his presence how many know brother branham said your your thoughts are heard louder in heaven i didn't even finish it so you all said amen your thoughts are heard louder in heaven than your words are on earth so our thoughts our groanings the real you what you're going through our thoughts about that is like being broadcast in heaven if there were speakers up there and all the angels and things i hope they don't say sometimes in our private lives could y'all please turn that down please turn that down what are they thinking what is she thinking what is he thinking it's being broadcast through heaven and you were just whispering it and you weren't just thinking it god's so great i said that for a reason though sometimes we can be saying so great things and great this and that and really it's our thoughts that's being broadcast through heaven that's louder than our words down on earth we can be all so loud vocally and it's like the angels probably just turn them down turn them down when they start thinking later tonight that's the real person and i think some of us would maybe be embarrassed and we just need to come to the reality lord remember me we are what we are by the grace of god but is it god's great grace great come on everyone i'm just giving you a moment is god's grace great it'll reach right down and cover the multitude of sins but you and i've got to be willing to say those words huge words lord remember me i'm not asking you to quote a paragraph or recite a chapter tonight's very simple and and don't stumble over it over simplicity the message sunday morning before the seven seals god in simplicity and then the sunday after the very sunday after god in simplicity it's like god knew that we as humans needed it like a sandwich everything in the middle is important but god in simplicity and god and simplicity i know you need the opening of the seven's heels and and the thunders and the you know the deep mysteries but you need god in simplicity if you're tripping up over kindergarten you can't graduate it's time to go to the next level it's time for the young people the message to start speaking the word and for it's not the minister and the whole focus even in the last 14 months globally we've seen a lot of places streaming and zooming and it's like the whole focus is the preacher the preacher the one man and you know you know keep it focused there because we're not all wearing masks and blah blah blah blah blah you know keep it focused in well friends it's not all the preacher we're a body we're a body it's the congregation it's brothers and sisters we're all part of a body we don't just need the preachers excited we don't just need the preachers anointed we don't just need them filled with the holy ghost we wanted to put it right back on to you i'm more worried about monday morning and tuesday than i am friday night right now i'm just fine and tomorrow night we're going to have a great service and sunday morning but i'm more worried about when you go home tuesday than my ego or how this service is gonna go i'm more worried about three o'clock in the morning when satan's really got you with your back against the wall what are you going to say to him i'm trying to put something in your pocket i'm trying to give you another rock david hallelujah i'm trying to put some rocks in your script bag so you reach down in there to kill your goliath it's not empty-handed and you're not talking about the prophet and talking about the preacher oh he killed his goliath i'm talking about you i'm trying to put some some rocks down in your pocket come on reach down in your pocket lord remember me i'm not preaching to brother david i'm not preaching to the deacons i'm not preaching to the trustees here i'm speaking to you i'm trying to give something to you grab a hold of that and say lord remember me i don't care who you are or what you've done very good did you get the message i had three words for you tonight i'm just building all around it and i'm trying to be sensitive to nail it home you know lord remember me i'm going to let everybody be selfish tonight just for a few minutes a lot of you are that way anyway you know i i didn't mean to slam you i'm just being honest you know me me and i i i i i didn't mean that as a slam i'm a br i breathe too you know you go through starbuck you're going through these airports and the starbucks line is like way on down it's like my goodness there must be something good in there either that or it's a cult or something you got to have starbucks so they got the app or something i got the app too but i'm not going to stand in that long line brother jim i'll just walk on down here and get a no-name coffee have more time to study so i can write notes like this on the airplane goodness man a few months ago it was like every other seat's empty and the planes are half empty and nobody now it's every single plane and you're sitting there sitting there i've already got prepared i have my notepads i have my pen and i'm just writing and writing this guy's looking over at my saying like this and i'm i'm on the whole flight it's over three almost four hours and i'm writing right and writing for you it's like the lord's preparing inspiration isn't the lord wonderful so for the next few minutes i'm going to focus on you lord remember me i want it to be personal because oftentimes we pray and we remember others and that's good do you all have prayer requests at this church do you do y'all have prayer requests at your church wherever you're from no hello i'm talking to you your prayer requests and it's usually for others is that right i know some people you know on their statuses they put you know happy birthday to me and happy anniversary to me they just want the world to know it's my birthday you know oh happy birthday sister so-and-so no i'm talking about you sometimes we pray and we remember others lord remember that person i i can see that young lady she seems to be struggling that that brother just seems to be not as connected as i just love for him to be connected more to the lord and you're just you're praying for others many are the needs of of people others let's all say others someone outside of you you know that person or my friend or someone in my family brother john really needs the lord would you remember them so many prayers go up in requests and desires for other people and would we all agree tonight there are other people that have more desperate needs than us would you all agree yes there's other people that are a lot worse off than we are we need to thank god for good health if you walked into this building tonight you got to thank god for feet legs lungs hands can somebody praise the lord a little bit hands hallelujah i'm asking you to remember the lord because that's part of communion is remembering the lord remembering him but tonight it's you're you saying lord remember me means there's been a connection there's a lot of other people that have more desperate needs than you and i and there's more urgent cries like we're all sitting here but in just a few hours there could be a car turned upside down flipped over and gasoline going out and somebody gets more urgent i mean you that are not showing a lot of emotion which show a lot of emotion it's like let's get out of here what's going to happen get me out of here urgent cries my baby do you remember the young man in memphis that went down the wrong road and it was sexual sin brother branham used the word social disease we might as well call it what it is he had went down the wrong road and he was from a good family and his mother was a real good believer but i'm talking personal and he's out there like rowing in a dark place and a mother is praying for him and got a hold of a prophet that was flying in an airplane and caused it to settle overnight and god had enough love for a young man that was like the thief on the cross [Music] he had a good mama he was under the token we would say he came from a family that she knew how to pray there's most of us that probably would have had this kind of attitude you know like where did he get in that place i mean he's looking his own house says has good atmosphere and everything we look down on one another how did you get in this place you know better than that you know what i mean and we get this attitude about it help us lord but by the end of the story oh mama oh mama it's getting light around here [Music] [Applause] and some time later goes by and the same young man is down by the the train station and he's waving brother man and brother branham don't you recognize me no i don't think i recognize you not not only did god heal me but i saved too somebody had time to pray for him somebody had him in an atmosphere somebody said lord remember us we need you to come by our way and god came by his way i say god give us more times like that in 2021 that you can come by our way lord where the lights can come on for somebody it's just they're just sitting in a meeting and all of a sudden the lights are coming on feelings coming back again it's like they're all flesh and that like gray looking and by the end of the service by the end of the meeting it's just like a sweetness settles over them it's the love of god constraining their heart it's like they've been in an atmosphere it's like they've been in a a breathing room it's like breathe in breathe out breathe in breathe out if you don't you're gonna die some of you holding your breath amen brother john knows what it's like to have this crazy virus here i didn't i said we're not going to talk about it we're going to talk about it i know what it's like to not be able to breathe and think like i was literally gonna die and like this is crazy you know just a few days ago i'm fine and i'm preaching and everything now what's going on i know what it's like to sweat and have all the symptoms but i also know what it's like to stand in front of the mirror and say you devil get out of my life we're not made to be sick we get sick and we get in a situation as youth and we don't understand we're trying to find our way out we make decisions and we do heirs we make wrong decisions and start paying the price it's called consequences say well i guess i'm just gonna go to hell i guess there's no hope for me and god's coming by your way tonight just asking you to pray three words lord remember me i'm not even asking you to scream it out i'm just saying can you pray it in your heart i'm encouraging you to whisper it pray it put it in your thoughts put it in your mind water it with with praise a little bit that's why we laugh we cry and i had to learn brother matthew to breathe again like i'm 49 years young don't say old brother i'm 49 years young and i had to learn brother trevor to breathe i mean we're not a little baby but it's like breathe oh yeah oh yeah it's like i remember yeah i need to breathe we get to get so like you know like okay you're right you all know what i'm talking about and they put that little thing on you and you text your oxygen and your heartbeat and i'm like man my oxygen is going like 90s 80s and like come on breathe just breathe again and you just see the numbers go back it's like man i need to learn how to breathe come on billy breathe sometimes as christians we need to encourage one another come on let's breathe a little bit let's shout to the lord we we get so dead and down there and satan's got his knee on our on our necks against the pavement and god's saying come on breathe say but i have pre-existing conditions he said i'm greater than all that if you don't you're going to die there come on i'm bigger than all your problems who are you talking about the lord not the president not the mayor not your sports team i'm talking about jesus is in the room amen jesus is just in the room he he's been walking up and down these aisles for the last few minutes if some of you could see the angels that you came to church with that brother branham said when you're born each one of you are assigned with an angel and your guardian angel and all these angels that are kind of resting because you've been running around all week and they need to rest too some of you the way you drive if you could just if you could just have a little video of the supernatural they're hanging on to the bumper as you go my wife got pulled over the other day and it's like goodness man it's like she and and they let her off again anybody that knows my wife knows she's probably the one person and all the message that's got the most warning i'm serious she probably bats her eyes or something or whatever but she don't give phone numbers but you know what i mean she's going to kill me you know she's streaming this service right now and she's like oh no she's just clicked off probably right now oh my goodness well she can't say nothing hallelujah she said she's saying honey don't remember me she said stop it stop it and she's going 39 miles an hour and a 25. rushing you know oh just block that off the tape brother for the parks just block that off but you know we we all we in this past week we've had things that we've done or said or thought that we need to say lord remember us lord that's not all your goodness going to get you in the rapture it's going to be god's mercy there's not one single person that goes in the rapture that's going to be say i was a good person you dirty rotten person you you deserve to be this man over here [Applause] you know you've made fun of you've scoffed you've laughed you misunderstood but tonight i'm trying to get you over here it's just three words we could learn it tonight in the english language but it's not english even on the inscription above jesus wasn't english it was latin and greek and there you go so whatever your heart is they say whatever language you dream in that's your mother tongue that's a side note i i like to ask people from africa did you do you dream in french swahili i'm serious russian dutch that's your language let's move along you know say stay with the word brother okay let's get back to the word it's not english that's that's not the heavenly language hallelujah you all know that right yeah it was in french when he said all that you ever love well what did he say what was it in french when if i was preaching this in congo they'd be standing up screaming yeah because you have chosen the harder right it was friends she was like what did he say what did he say there because you've chosen the harder way a huge portion of heaven away and i called you to be a prophet to preach to a generation and i'm going to take you off the scene and i'm going to let years go by in the message and raise up a whole new another generation that never knew the prophet he didn't we didn't hunt with him we didn't fish with him so we look beyond him and we see jesus i see jesus all the big name preachers all the one man ministries they fade away all the huge doctrines it's called splits and old fighters god's raising up a generation that aren't interested in none of that we're not interested in it give me jesus just talk to me straight preach the gospel so tonight lord remember us here in dallas texas there's more serious requests and more urgent cries but if it what would it profit us if we save the whole world and lose ourselves do you all know that song here it's an old time song it's not my brother or my sister but it's me oh lord standing in the need of prayer have you ever heard that song it's not my mother or my father but it's me o lord not the preacher or the deacon but it's me o lord it's me lord remember me i'm on my cross tonight i'm fixed here i'm here lord speaking to you i need you lord tonight i hear the cry of the youth of the message i hear it like a blading of lambs or of sheep i hear the cry of the youth of the message globally saying i want to see the same lord jesus that i've heard about i want to see him made real today i'm not interested in just to pass jesus we can talk about jesus on the cross all night long and cry and worship and all of that but i want to see him walk into this room and make himself known to somebody that would just generate something from the depths of your soul that would say lord remember me tonight you're not despised the young people of the message are not despised by god you're not an afterthought in fact you're not children anymore when the voice spoke to brother branham and said um there's a work for you to do when you get older he was younger and god called some of you to be christians and give your life to him when you were younger but you're not younger there's a work for you to do and tonight we're going to get into that more god called peter to be his disciple and he said come follow me come follow me and he dropped his fishing nets and he followed the lord many of you have followed the lord for years but then after jesus went through his week of the passion do you all remember that acts 1 3 the passion of his death tomorrow night i'm speaking on youth with passion and we think of passion in a certain way but god's trying to get your thoughts turned a little bit after jesus died on the cross he came to peter and said follow me in other words it's not just follow me to be a disciple follow me to give your heart to christ follow me to baptism most of you've done that he's trying to get you to recognize that life isn't all fun and gain follow me to death are you able to take up your cross and follow me peter peter i'm trying to get your attention i'm in the 40 days i've only got a few minutes with you i'm trying to grab a hold of your heart and on the 40th of the day jesus went up into heaven he was gone and they could no longer touch him and fish oh i would die for you but he needed an experience peter needed an experience of that same jesus coming inside of him and oh god may that happen for all of us that it's not just god up there god over there god in jeffersonville god in tucson but god here god where's the revival in the message it's right here that's what they said over in europe when they said where's the welsh revival they they flew away over there and their big hats and their turn where's the welsh revival and that policeman just twirling his behind he said you finally arrived he didn't say well it's down this road and turn left and right at the third light and all of it he said you're looking at it i've experienced it i met him i prayed lord remember me and you know what happened do you know what happened he remembered me in my time of trouble she remembered me why are you here tonight god remembered you you're part of his body he loves you he died to save you he creates these opportunities for somebody to say it in another way lord remember me tomorrow remember me on monday when i've got to go back to school and back to my situation at home and back to my life lord i i'm sorry but a lot of us have become message druggies well we just constantly need like a fix and a fix and when's the next meeting and when's the next this and where we can we go and the same ones that didn't have the holy ghost three years ago didn't have it two years ago didn't have it a year ago didn't have it two months ago didn't have it last month when's it going to be the time that we say god met me he failed me he remembered me [Music] [Applause] where's the young people in our churches that can grow and mature and become the church where we're not backslidden and we don't always fall back and we don't need another weekend to have another drug fix i live on these drugs i gotta have it in the morning gotta have it in the day i got some of your attention amen it's not weed just because they make marijuana legal don't make it holy i think i said that here before you know just because they legalize things don't make it righteous we still need to shun the very appearance of evil and some of you need to realize that too much time on your on your devices is sin and you really show who you love by where you spend your time and we can have so much face time or so much screen time and how much time do we have with jesus we show it when we leave by what how we live whether you've been with the husband we can talk old you know we're older you can tell you've been with someone if the life is flowing out of you automatically hallelujah do you all know what i'm talking about so in conclusion tonight there was a young lady she's just from the time she was 15 years old 16 years old she was stricken with tuberculosis and she was in a horrible situation she was a teenager and her father was a deacon and her mother was a staunch person but they weren't message believers in fact they kind of were making fun of healing and things but this young lady had heard about someone else being healed and she began to just cry out in her heart cry out for healing i mean it was so bad and so horrible she laying in her bed just that she couldn't even go to the bathroom they just pulling the bed sheets out and changing it and things and it was horrible she went down to 30 something pounds she went from a strong teenager now she's 25 years old but it got to a place where she just started to cry out like a lamb blading does anybody know that i'm here laying in this bed does anybody know i've passed easter i passed my birthday i passed christmas all the youth meetings they're all having and i'm in this bed 16 years old sweet 16 18 19 i'm just fading away does anybody even care anymore i'm in a no-name town that even a prophet don't know about man i've gone really low brother jackson even my preacher don't believe in divine healing and i need help brother and it was the cry of a human but in another dimension a man that was close to god heard it like a lamb like a lamb bleeding it's the most pitiful thing in the world just blading bleeding that's a poor little thing and and there was he just had a burden i've got to find that person i gotta get to that young person feed my lambs feed my sheep and just the prayers and the burden and even said the name of the place to go to and he didn't know where that city was and finally brother wright knew where to go and they went down there and there had been things happen in the church it was a church and the minister had done some things and the people had scattered the church was closed up they were just using it kind of for funerals and things and the city had taken over and the congregation had all left and went to other churches and the man prayed lord if you want me in this church you're going to have to unlock these doors [Music] and the man came walking around and said i see you here do you want to get inside i got the keys you know god works on both ends of the line tonight before you even pray lord remember me god had already sent the answer he already is the answer the answer's hanging in the middle you don't have to run away to another continent the peace that you're craving for in your heart isn't across the ocean it's not in another relationship it's not because down the road there's tears and sorrow and even in god's perfect will it's not always easy there's a lot of crying and pains i know what i'm talking about so now a teenager had become a young lady and a young person a young adult we would say blading blading my my my and it just seems like nobody has time they're too busy they're so worried about the music or the church order or the virus oh i gave it more credit or they're worried about this or that and nobody has even time where's the oil where's the wine i need help i'm bleeding i'm bleeding i've been knocked off my horse i'm in trouble and and we get too busy you know what time is it is it 9 10 i've been preaching over an hour or so but you know what friends we're all guilty in just a few minutes brother matthew's already called and upped the food so you all can all come in a few minutes this quiet audience is going to be talking talking sharing and talking and talking and enjoying one another that's wonderful that's fantastic but we just got a few minutes in his presence that some of us need to pray this long prayer lord remember me and receive the word of god and let it strike a chord remember me in my situation i'm praying for god's will in my life i need direction that's maturity is looking beyond the now i'm preaching a whole sermon right now in 10 seconds look beyond the now look beyond what you see look beyond that have maturity and realize i'm pulling for that brother i'm pulling for that sister you don't even need to look around and see everyone back there but if you don't need this maybe it's for somebody over here but it's like lord minister to them let the holy spirit just come right over that person just may the presence of god saturate them before we leave and it's not going to be coca-cola that gets us in the rapture it's not going to be a good steak or some food or some fellowship or a volleyball game it's not going to get us in the rapture say well we're not going to do none of that we don't need none of that we need to enjoy life live life and god bless all of you none of us are at pubs tonight or down in downtown you know selling our virtues for cheat we're in the presence of god we're responsible to give one another life and i give you healing i don't need to lay hands on you just my shadow going by you brother can heal you that's what happened in the book of hats what about you sisters over here just wave your hand a little bit and your shadow goes over three other sisters and you just see that depressive dark cloud just leave [Applause] now that's a youth meeting that's young people that know their position they know they have authority take all the devils and demons in this place under your control well you say brother branham prayed that where is the generation that your prophet said that that wave sheath was cut it was the mess and waved over the field saying there's more out in the field that's going to come to maturity [Applause] and but we got all the focus on the ministry and on the minister and they're going to lay hands on me they're going to pray the prayer of faith and god's trying to say you pray the paraphrase [Applause] we're not passing out pacifiers tonight you're old enough where the diapers and all of that god's trained us long enough and i'm not speaking negative about none of that there was a time when a nurse needed to pull us out of the womb there was a time when a daddy and a mother and a minister needed to be there to encourage us and guide us down that road less traveled but we're you've grown now there ought to be a traveled road where you can say i've been with jesus [Music] i'm not messing around i'm not playing hands just playing hands and footsies under the table i mean business brother john hallelujah that wasn't in my notes either but it's good to say it god's raising up a generation of young men and women that can pass their parents go beyond the faith of their ministers and go beyond the people in the sound booth and and the trustees and deacons and many old people sitting back there mocking and scoffing and saying we've gone long enough well there's somebody saying i need more of this i need jesus so i've been longer and i need to close but this young lady finally began to cry out to god and god brought brother branham to her house georgie carter i pray god fill our youth group with a bunch of georgie carter a bunch of teenagers and girls in their 20s that she needed to get to jesus she couldn't even get out of her bed so jesus had to come to her and her mother didn't believe in divine healing finally her dad said whatever and the preacher said okay you can have him come over and see you and brother branham was praying as you know and there was a little book of brother branham's laying there by the side of the bed and she got to where her hands had been put back on the side of her bed i've been in this room i've met georgie carter personally brother trevor you've probably been there sister edmund you've probably been there and her hands as a teenager it got so on the back of her bed just i'm reading here the paint was rubbed off the bed where she had held and cried and prayed for deliverance her church didn't believe in divine healing and she got this book and she seen in the paper where another girl had been healed and she wanted to be healed some of us need to get sick and tired of being sick and tired and we need to say lord remember me tonight god met brother branham and the holy spirit swept through that place and gave brother branham a word and said go by the way of carters said her name i tell you god knows your name hallelujah god knows your name he knows your address he knows your phone number he knows the need in your life and brother branham how many remembers the time brother branham would call out and say is there anybody here that would like to give and they would raise their hand and then he would say would you just come forward and none of them come forward i think there was one young man was there one all right and brother brown said i pray it would be another isaiah then brother branham dropped back in discernment in this one message and i think there was 13 people he'd begin to call him out call him out and you back there the people begin to wail and ah oh the whole audience now he said now who would like to come and give your heart and he said it was all packed out people up and down the aisles and my people rejoice and i'm sure there was preachers saying yes yes we hid it tonight and brother bradham said you've done the worst thing you could have ever done he said you should have came the first time he said you needed me to call your name out and tell your name and your address and all of this then you came you know sometimes we have meetings like that and maybe one or three or something you know those are the ones that serious i don't know what the other two or three hundred got but we don't need a prophet to rebuke us tonight and say we should have done it the first time we should have done it when the word was going forth we should have responded if god dealt with your heart and you raised your hand or you stood or you had a need you said lord remember me don't be ashamed of that jesus is talking to you tonight saying lord remember me brother bradham walked into that place laid hands on her and i'm going to the end of the story and our musicians you can about just get ready to come and she's laying there crying and crying hat and raised off of the bed for nine years and eight months horrible couldn't get on a bus couldn't fly to some meetings couldn't drive to some gatherings she was hungry i got to be in this bed i'm so embarrassed they're having to pull the bed sheet out i can't even go to the bathroom he said she hadn't even looked outside for nine years and ain't that's horrible and she's trying to sleep at night she's just grabbing the bed the paint rubbed off of it she's crying out not for the next episode of whatever she was hungry to see the supernatural that same god that did it for that other girl can do it for me but now we've gone way past you know medical and natural health i'm only 35 36 pounds even if i would be healed it'd take me months to recover i'd need rehabilitation in my bones and muscles and everything do you know brother branham walked into that room prayed for this girl that poor little girl weighing not over 36 or 37 pounds a bunch of bones she couldn't have stood if she had to not only stood but she jumped to her feet screaming to the top of her voice people began to scream perfectly normal and well her mother fainted and the sister came running in she didn't know what to do screaming her father coming across the yard with a with a container of milk in his hand and he heard the piano playing and he ran into the house to find out what it was there was his daughter that had never moved from that bed for nine years and eight months [Applause] hallelujah lord if you did that for georgie carter you can do that for somebody here tonight [Applause] you did that for that black man laying in a bed it's so dark send the faith to a fight to a mother send the faith to a prophet he didn't know where he was going he just heard a voice said keep walking keep walking i'm walking tonight we've been walking since seven seven o'clock just keep walking just keep walking it's taking this long for those evil spirits to leave oh mama oh billy it's getting light around here his daughter been playing on that piano never moved for nine years and eight months sitting at the piano playing jesus keep me near the cross there's a precious fountain sounds like the thief on the cross there's a precious fountain y'all are good believers i heard brother david say that to you all you all know there's a precious fountain it's jesus and you're on the cross tonight you're fixed there so you ought to be able to align your faith right up there immediately we have no excuse is that why the lord seems to be delaying his coming is to make sure that all of us have the opportunity to just be ready just be ready lord remember us lord remember me tonight and there she was perfectly normal and brother bottom said that same lord jesus that healed georgie that night is right here tonight to do the same thing for every individual that's standing in divine presence do you believe that i believe it lord as we bow our heads and our musicians come i hear the cry of the youth hear the cry of the young people blading i want to see jesus in my life the same as i have heard and seen him i want to know him fill me lord heal me
