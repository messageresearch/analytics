Questions & Answers
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service: June 20,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

lord lord one more thing we can ask lord may your presence be with us find glory in all the service from the beginning to the end as we ask it in your name the name above all the name the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen good to be gathering the house of god this morning man you want to welcome all our visitors god bless you this morning and please invite by the mic for our song meeting amen good morning we're going to be reading in psalm 110 this morning you know this is a scripture that has some familiar verses to us i'm sure we all recognize the opening verse of the chapter it says in verse 1 the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool you know we've heard many sermons about the scripture you know no doubt we rejoice in the idea that there was one who was sent who completed a redemption work who defeated every foe and now sits at the right hand of the throne you know and one by and there he sits until one by one things are brought under subjection to him you know what's so amazing though that this was written by david perhaps a thousand years before jesus ever came on the scene you know giving us an appreciation i think for the things he was speaking in the psalms under a prophetic gift you know i started to think about that declaration sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool jesus said a couple things in in john chapter 5 he said in verse 22 for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son and then he says in verse 27 and hath given him the son authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man so we know that his work involves executing judgment you know judgment is someone under authority putting something or someone in its rightful place under the law that's what that's what the act of judgment is whether the declaration is innocence or guilt whether it's clean or unclean judgment is the declaration of your position under the law you know but i wanted to focus just a little bit on that idea of judgment if we look at psalm 110 which we're going to read this morning you know he describes the work of the son of man in the terms of judgment he describes his work like any job that somebody has when you have work to do there's the work that you do the workplace that you do it in and the tool that you use to do the job and psalm 110 describes his work his workplace and the tools that he uses to do the job you know his workplace in verse one is at my right hand that's the place where he's doing the work is at the right hand of the throne most of the chapter as we'll read is describing his work which involves judgment it says in verse 6 for example he will judge among the heathen so we'll go and we'll read and we'll see some of these examples but what's interesting is he also mentions the tools that he uses to do the job and that's in verse 2 it says the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies you know the thing about he's the tool that he's using is a rod it's just a rod it's just a stick you know but what's interesting is the rod has significance in scripture it's mentioned several times it's used as a tool of measurement in leviticus 27 it's used as an eating utensil several times for samuel 14 as an example it's used for chastening and correction we're all probably most familiar with that it's used for comfort it's on 23. it's a token of inheritance and it's a symbol of the family number 17 psalm 74. it's used even for doing something like beating the chaff out of the wheat on the threshing floor isaiah 28 it's used for shepherding sheep jews for prying a rock out of the way but a rock a rod is nothing more than a stick if you were to take a rod and set it here in this pulpit it would just sit there it would do none of these things until it's taken into someone's hand and then it becomes the extension of the work that that person is doing if they're doing a chastening work then that rod becomes a rod of chastening if they're doing a comforting work then that rod becomes an extension of their comforting work if it's a measurement tool it becomes an extension of their measurement work but it has no role in and of itself it's just a piece of dead tree flesh just a piece of dead flesh in the hand of someone doing a work and it becomes an extension of that work so in psalm even moses for example that just comes to mind here when he went to the burning bush he went to meet that meeting and he had a stick that was used for shepherding sheep it was a shepherd's rod when he walked away from that pillar of fire it was the rod of god because the work had changed in psalm 110 verse 2 when it says the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion well then that's where that tool comes from and we know that zion is a people so the work that he does as he places all things in its position according to the word is a tool that he picks up and extends out of zion which is a people is there a people here i wonder who have become a tool dead flesh in the hands of the one who is doing a judgment work it's amazing the things that david wrote a thousand years before jesus ever came on the scene you know so my prayer and i hope yours is as well that is i can be that rod that tool that he can use to perform that positioning work in this hour the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies his work his workplace and the tool that he uses to do the job let's read psalm 110 together it's just a short psalm starting in verse 1 the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries he shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift up the head amen amen god bless you may have your seats amen man speaking of melchizedek i mean if you haven't if you have a question and hadn't had a chance to submit it you can just go right outside and write it and they're going to take it over to brother david or you can just put it in the bucket outside and if he doesn't get a chance to answer it this morning he'll answer it tonight amen amen how many have enjoyed it

the lord teres we just love the lord let's approach him this morning in prayer our heavenly father we've come to day in this natural country that we live in has declared this holiday as father's day lord another reason to go out and shop and buy presents and we're grateful for that but father the real father's day is because our father gave us a gift [Music] and lord that's what has brought us here from many different walks of life and many different countries and many different skill level and educational levels because we've all been birthed by one father and that's what makes us one and in one accord we're not a religion we're not a church we're not an educated theological group we are a people we are an offspring of jehovah and lord that makes us brothers and sisters and sisters with the same eternal creator and we ask you to bless us this morning in your great goodness in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning we're going to try to do some questions and answers so let's turn in our bibles and uh over to the book of uh uh corinthians first corinthians and the 15th chapter and so our visitors that are uh with us today lord rich they bless you and and i'm sure that there may be things that you might hear for the first time and and we're grateful for that and if i can't answer some of the questions each one of you has a right to come to me and sit down and talk and i'll be happy to answer any personal questions or further clarifications that we have but i i'd like you to listen as we read this portion of scripture because it lets us know that we weren't the first people to have questions and so when you read it it's really amazing so let's let's talk about some of the things that were on the mind of the corinthian church and the questions that they have and and so we read start in the 35th verse of the 15th chapter of corinthians but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come way back there you know and it says about fool and that don't kind of that word they use isn't the same way that we use fool it's got a little different connotation without fool that which thou soweth is not quickened except it die and that which thou soweth thou soweth not that body that shall be but bear grain it may change of wheat or of some other grain but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beast another of fishes and another of birds there are celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there was one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the second adam was made a quickening spirit how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and after that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth earthly the second man is the lord from heaven as the earthly such are they also that are earthly and as the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly a great scripture of predestination and as we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the heavenlies now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated this morning we have uh several uh questions this morning uh and they're good questions and all the answers kind of tie together this this subject of malchezidak's a wonderful subject it's just it it it's just so rich and it's deep and it's beautiful and what we hope in doing this is that we can find ourselves in the word in the plan of god and you know god uh he loves us i mean that's i don't know why many times you know what i mean but he has he loves us so much that he gave his only begotten son for us and we all realize that if we look back over time we understand that life has progressed it progressed and progressed and it seems like the longer man lives the more trouble that he has their sicknesses and diseases like we've never seen before and we become to the place where we begin to realize that we're fragile we always have this terminology that people different people i know use when one of those people will drive down the road and at alongside you and you're on the freeway and you're keeping your eye on the speedometer because you're right at the top of the match you know and uh and here comes somebody by you on a motorcycle going 120 miles an hour on one wheel and we would often make the the description that person has a death wish in other words they're they're they're dealing with death and or they're on the edges or the fringes of death they don't realize how dangerous what they're doing or how close to the edge of catastrophe they are and being in such a precarious position and trusting so many people around you and you know all it would take is one person having a bad day to just do that little jerk with this car and and cause something to happen so we're aware of that there's an acute awareness when something like that happens that it brings a sense to you well that's crazy that that's flirting with death that's playing with death well there's one thing certain for all of us we're all playing with death i don't care how far you go back in your lineage i don't have a father today to call because my father's passed on my natural father i do have a heavenly father that i can call but we realize that there is a time that our time on earth is done and we are not here this morning to prepare for the time allotted to us in this life your parents were given to you to do that school was given to you that you made those life choices of picking your occupation picking your education picking your mates picking the places that you choose to live and those are your life choices that you make we're here to talk about something eternal because the choices that you make in this life not only have your life consequences but they have eternal consequences the wages of sin is death and and the another word for sin is unbelief you know of murder robbery all those what we would call crimes or those are the attributes of sin they're not sin sin is unbelief and one that doesn't believe in eternity and doesn't believe in life after death that disbelief will cause them to live a life that will lead them to death because there's no regard for somebody that's eternal there's no regard for the maker there's no regard for the creator and there's no regard for why that he made things and so he's not brought into the conversation and that's what the word of god says he says not wishing to retain god in their knowledge so they no longer wanted to think about god they didn't want to consider god in their life choices i'm going to make this choice how does it affect me eternally how does it prepare me for life after death and they don't they no longer wish to retain that in their thinking so god gives them over to a reprobate mind another a mind that doesn't consider spiritual things so everything in their life becomes carnal how much money i can make how much prestige i can gain how much pleasure i can receive and their lives are motivated by carnal things and the scripture tells us that to be carnally minded is to be an enemy of god because god created us for a purpose and part of that purpose god's purpose was us to have an eternal side of our life so god never intended us just to live in this flesh only just to have 70 years on earth or or longer uh uh you know i'm i'm only 71 i'll be 72 in october uh one poor brother the other day thought i was too old to eat steak and so no i i still got my teeth they're they're a little wore out but uh uh you know i i hope god allots me a lot of years you know i hope when he takes me home i'm still mentally capable of preaching the gospel but but we're here to talk about eternal and part of this eternal question was even raised back there when men begin to talk about the resurrection because not everybody believed in the resurrection but there were people that believed in the resurrection and he saved but some men will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come so the the question of eternal life is a great question and it's a good question to get answered and get settled in your heart for sure you know i have meant people i i as you know my testimony there was a period in my life where i hung around with the hells angel motorcycle gang and those guys will testify right to your face i'm going to hell they know it you know what i mean they don't they don't pretend to be religious you know i remember when i first got converted i brought bibles to the guys i know and i i testified them to them about the lord and the real guys they brought it back to me and handed me the bible back and he said man i appreciate what you're doing you know as far as i'm concerned you're forgotten you know you're you don't owe us nothing you know what i mean you go go serve the thing you say but this isn't for me it looks like i'm just going to hell and you know you do anything in your life to express to them that the love of god is greater than any sin that they could have ever done that that that that's why he came and that they were trapped in the sin and and it's and i wish i would have known back in them days about election you know possibly i would have had the words to speak that i could speak past the mind to that seed that light in the heart and that they would be so generated in in the love of god but i'll read you the questions and then we'll kind of go through them and it says the first question in is what is the order of melchizedek and and then here's another question he says when melchizedek was in his theophany and fellowshipped with abraham did he have his five natural senses another question the question was jesus's glorified body the same as melchizedek's now these are sometimes questions huh i hope you didn't expect to get any answers for me and then this is what is the difference between abraham melchizedek jesus and brother branham and another question is did the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell in brother branham so we'll kind of you hold those questions up and we'll kind of go through some things and within those things trusting that we will find the answers but let's just take kind of the last question first because we're going to battle something all morning long as we go through these answers i'm going to try to hurry so uh we can try to get out it's a lot to cover but is we're always going to battle our mental conception and our definition of words okay so paul said here there's a natural body and a spiritual body so that lets us know that there's two types of bodies now none of us have a clue what a spiritual body is naturally you know what i'm saying we know they exist as some you know maybe some of you have had dreams and seen things maybe some of you have seen spirits there's people that have gifts to see spirits and and so i know that they're real and and and in my own way of testifying i've seen things that weren't in the flesh but but everything that we're going to relate to we only relate to to what that we know and what that we sense we have words that mean things to us so what is a word a word is a thought expressed so i try to use a word that expresses my thoughts but also is a word that connects with your thoughts and so that's why some people go through great dissertations and use lots of explanation and lots of words and lots of their hand movements too to try to communicate the thought by words and actions so our minds can get on the same level you know do you get it do you understand what i mean you know there's some place in there there's got to be a satisfaction that you've communicated what that you're trying to express and so this great this is a great question did the fullness of the godhead bodily dwell on brother branham now we know why that question comes up that question comes up because of the works that god did through him we understand in in the scriptures and you notice we have this picture here which you probably wouldn't find in most uh christian churches because some people would think that might be a form of idolatry but there's no other savior of man saved the lord jesus christ what what saved men was the sacrifice that was made on calvary the blood of the lord jesus christ that's what forgave us of our sins and and that's that's the ultimate uh sacrifice that was made on our behalf the law of god said that there's a punishment for sin and so if if there was a punishment made for sin then everybody would have had to receive the punishment of sin what was death but if the chastisement of our peace was upon him in other words he paid the price for our sins so instead of us taking the reward or the just do for our sins he took that upon him he paid the price he paid the price with his own life and he laid that life down for us and then he gave us hope by resurrecting now so we realized that through the scriptures there was promises made in the word of god and after the lord jesus had died and resurrected he commissioned his prophet and his apostles to go into the upper room and wait to be endued with power from on high i will not leave you comfortless but i will come again i'll be with you even in you till the end of the world the works that i do shall you do also the disciples went up there they were restored once again with the power of the lord they went out and they began to preach the gospel every man hearing them in their own tongues and signs and wonders followed without going into lengthy bible teachings we understand that satan rose up against that spirit and he began to move against the church in four spirits identified in four horse riders in the book of revelations and he began to politicize things he began to join the church and state until he formed the catholic church and we realized that in the dark ages every all religion at that time had come under one headship of catholicism and we understand that was a fulfillment of scripture that the seed had to go on the ground then that life began to come forth in luther and that life moved on farther through wesley came back into the restoration of the gifts at pentecost and then the promise in malachi 4 5 is that all that the palmer worm and the cankerworm and the locusts had eaten i will restore saith the lord so we understand that the true word of god because in this age we realized that there was going to be a famine not only for food but for the pure unadulterated word of god that god brought forth a ministry that would restore back the faith or restore back the true revelation of the word of god to his elect children that the mysteries that those four horses that went out in revelation covered up and hid every time that horse rider went out he robbed something from the church and he replaced it with something hybrid something man-made and then commit and then so and god would fight it and then he would go farther and he he rode out in in a a a red horse and we realized that that he slew he killed everybody that was against the catholic church as heretics and i was a catholic and studied to be a priest for one year so don't think i'm just anti-catholic i'm not anti-catholic i'm revelated and and saved but i believe catholics can be saved and so don't that's not the issue it's where they stood in history they got a vicar of christ the pope instead of of the lord that they put nickelodeon spirit cardinals bishops of priests parishes to rule over the people is a system a denominational system and every denomination has come from that they're the daughters of of the great harlot that's spoken up in the book of revelation we're not against the people by no means we're against a system that blinds the people and that's what happened and through that time every time he would fight man would mix they'd keep mixing their ideas their definitions their ideas until we got to this age and in this age god promised to send a ministry that would impersonate it and that's not a good word but or maybe us the word would be better mirror the ministry of the lord jesus christ in this age to the gentiles so at the end of the jewish age the lord jesus showed up but that was god in flesh but he his ministry was that as a prophet that's what they call them rabbi young prophet and he he he did works he prayed for the sick he preached the gospel he discerned the thoughts and tense of the heart he did that to the samaritans and he did it to the jews representing the three races of people handshaft and japan but that work and that sign had never been performed to the gentiles so at the end of the gentile age god promised to send a ministry back that would do the same works that jesus did when he was on earth to the jew and to the samaritan and then he would do it to the gentiles so the gentiles would have the same opportunity that the jews had either to accept or reject and so that ministry showed up right on time right when god promised it and it was extremely supernatural and so we we understood it as it was in the days of noah they were married and given into marriage so we recognized that that description of that time had come to full nutrition in this age where i almost seven out of ten marriages fail uh there's lots of divorce and and remarriage that and and that has nothing to do with anybody's soul okay we're not here to start to figure out fresh fleshly problems we're here to move above the flesh you can have a lot of problems in your life and get saved converted so it it it's nobody with a perfect life is going to be there the scripture says if you say that you've sinned not you're a liar but we have one that paid the price that's a mediator a partitionary for us making intercession to the father on our behalf and then so this this ministry that was promised came now that what was operating that ministry was not the vessel it was the same person that was in the lord jesus it was that same person that was operating that gift else it wouldn't have been equal so when the jew saw jesus they saw a man born of a woman that's what they saw they knew his father their father aren't this is james and such and his brothers aren't these the guys that we know up here in nazareth isn't this joseph's son some of them sent others said that he was illegitimate and so that's what they saw they they saw flesh but what was operating in that flesh was not the flesh okay to answer this question let's turn to saint john and the 14 10. let's just start and this is we this great uh scripture we'll just start with the seventh verse if ye had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip said unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him have i been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how to say is that thou then show us the father believeth doubt not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father and me or else believe me for the very works sake amen and then he goes on to say verily verily i send you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also greater works than these because i go unto the father and and if so so we see there that if they saw a man but what was in that man was who was doing the works so they when brother brown would come to a crowd like this brother brahm wasn't there to promote brother branham what he was showing was a fulfillment of a promise that god made that when the world got in a sodom condition how many of those were in a sodom condition you're marrying they're given into marriage and noah condition they're going to and fro science and education is multiplying upon the earth that's the noah condition the sodom condition was the the destruction of the morality of motherhood the misuse of the created form of woman and of men and women burning in their own lust turning their desires to one another not wishing to retain god in in their knowledge and therefore they went into what's called a sodom condition this country is just like it was in the days of sodom where um same-sex marriages was lawful and legal they functions that way it becomes normal that way the idea that you can choose your own identity in other words god has no part of your creation you now can recreate yourself i mean this is the truth i'm sorry i hate the i i hate that it's even a subject matter that i've got to discuss too many of the pulpits in this country today are too weak to address them and the scripture says when they get there they're going to gnash upon them with their teeth and they're going to wonder how come you didn't tell us the truth but it's insane for a parent to tell of their child that when you get old enough you choose whether you want to be a boy or a girl right then they've they have not taken the leadership to raise that child with any kind of character a real christian mother raises that daughter to be a mother she teaches her how to be subject to authority how to honor and respect what it means to labor and be satisfied and i know our our sisters some of them have to work because they don't have husbands and i understand that and if you can get a little bit of school and and get a little better job or you have a little better control of your environment i'm all for that i think it's hard for a christian girl to be a waitress for example you know where she gets all kinds of people and all kinds of sassary marks and and all kinds of into windows thrown at them and and put them stuff but if you get something that you can be in a place in a workplace that you can call the environment because you have to make a living that's fine if you're in a position of authority and you're a sister and you don't have a husband yet you conduct yourself as a christian you don't observe authority with bitterness in your heart and in those things you you act like a lady you treat other people like the lady you do your job as unto the lord all those things are are life situations that we un that we understand and and and we're not condemning them but you can't raise a child in the way it should go isn't that a scripture didn't i used to re hear that scripture if you don't know what it is you might as well give it a dog bone and put their food in a dish no it's the truth you know you can't even how can a man really preach the gospel if he can't tell women how to conduct themselves as women and dress like a woman that's why we don't wear those high heels that's why we don't wear those clothes that's why we don't wear those seedless things we don't look wear low-cut blouses we don't lean anything we never present our sexuality out in any form that it can be looked upon that the adultery would be committed you know everybody thinks it's your choice it's not our choice it's his choice and his choice was the word of god and that's what we live by we live by the word of god but once you take the core root out of the word of god that he made them male and female then you've taken him out of the whole plan of of of redemption you've taken him out of the whole plan you can't even say that he planned or predestinated your life because now they've taken it and put it into your hands well i know me i don't want my life in my hands i've already messed it up enough that's all part of the answer this is from things that are to be so we we we understood that there was a man that stood here in this day fulfilling the promises of the word of god the lord jesus christ was doing the works through his body so god was veiled in flesh okay he promised to appear in this day in the ministry of a prophet prophet son of man in the days when i'm revealed in the ministry of the son of man so the same spirit that was in the lord jesus the same ministry that was there came in this day veiled himself in a man man m-a-n and this will answer the question let's just get this one we'll go to the next one it says this is from things that are to be therefore the bride in the rapture will come forth and there is and there is all pre-planned by god all backed up from the beginning he knowed every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-planned god knew it would be here and when he made it that way so that when we get there he's going to prepare a place for us when we get there it'll all be prepared just like even this night is prepared like this hour is prepared yes his great foreknowledge tells him all these things by foreknowledge he's omnipresent because he's omnipotent omnipotent because he's omnipresent therefore by foreknowledge now he can't be just like the wind over the earth because he is a being he just isn't a myth he's a being he dwells he even dwells in a house he dwells in a place called heaven and therefore by his omni being omnipresent omnipotent and knowing all things then he's omnipresent because he knows all things right now in the message who is this about piece of brother brahm talks about the architect that's going to build something and this is where it separates and what makes god omnipresent omnipotent and knowing all things he had it in his mind is that right i was trying to find a big blackboard so i could doodle but i spell words wrong and then that's all i hear about for the rest of my life my kids grew up believing it was the holy spirit because i'd always put an e at the end i don't know why that's just the way i did it well so god is he's everywhere right i mean he's all that there is that's the best way i can explain it now he's got a plan and he's going to make heavens and earth so everything that's going to come forth he's going to make heavens and earth so that's what he's going to plan to do he's going to plan he's going to make heaven and earth he's got it all pre-planned he knows exactly uh what he's fixing to do and and so he's he's ready to move on so he said and so that's the the the way it is uh with the lord he says so god dwelt alone is that right it was just him he dwelt alone with his attributes so there's there was nothing there but him uh by himself so he says now in the beginning god dwelt alone that's paragraph four to four forty six of who of this melchizedek with his attributes as i spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone but he had thoughts so there's just god alone now he had thoughts okay and we know what some of those thoughts were because there's a heaven and there's the earth and the scripture tells us the invisible things of god were clearly seeing in the visible things around us the invisible things of god were his thoughts but they were just thoughts until they were expressed that like you can be mad at somebody but then if you can't keep it under control you're going to express what's on your mind you are the sorriest human being i've ever met in my life it would have been better off if you were never born i hope i don't ever see you again and you blow the steam off you let it now i know what you're thinking one minute ago i thought you liked me but now you've expressed your thoughts well it's like an architect right like a great architect he's got a thought now he's going to manifest that thought but an architect can't create so if god is going to manifest his thoughts he can only think what he is because he doesn't have anything on the outside to influence his thoughts he doesn't have any place else to gather information to gather things he doesn't have a light bulb come off doing or he doesn't see something many inventors or have seen something and all of a sudden they see something they think oh this would do that and they go develop that and and so somebody that's handy with their hands or understands machinery can understand how they do things and and and i like to watch machines how they make things and so but god he's not going to cr he's not going to use nothing he's absolutely the creator so every part down to the littlest molecule he's going to make and he's going to create and it's going to come from him therefore he knows all of it he knows what's it going to do when it's going to do it because it all came from him if you if you look in the gospel of of of saint john in the first uh the third verse of the first chapter of the gospel of saint john the first the first three verses in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so everything that was made was made by him and it without him in other words he made it all himself he made every screw every nut every bolt every spring all the laws that govern it okay so if he had it all in his mind you understand and now he creates it and he creates the time it's going to be there he already foreknows it before it's ever there he can't learn about it he made everything so really everything came from him the molecules the atoms not the perversion man's went out and mixed things and perverted things and changed things and done everything but the original plan of god god knew they would do that it's all part of his plan but everything came from him so he is already in it so he knows it he doesn't know it by being there he knows it by it being there before it was expressed that's how well he knows it remember the little man with the carburetor the guy just couldn't get it right the guy steps up in his suit walks over he says do you mind if i try the guy looks up at this guy goes why don't you go back in the waiting room where you belong the guy was so frustrated he said sure the guy took a screwdriver went in there and made a couple of little adjustments said try it now room room room the thing ran perfectly the guy said what did you do how did you do that he says well i'm the chief engineer at general motors i made this carburetor well he didn't make the gaskets right but god made the gaskets he made the screws he made the screw holes he made the amount of may he made everything he was he absolutely already knew everything there was ever to know about it so therefore he is omnipresent by what for knowledge or by creation but god has a place he dwells he dwells in heaven now brother brahm uses the word house for us to get an idea that he's a being he's not a wind he's not a myth he's a bean and he was a being without form but he took on a form he formed himself towards flesh he took on the form and and and he became he became the word and and so he took on that form now when you say that the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt and brother branham there's two things happening one the person that says that is not far from the truth they're using that terminology to express that that was deity that dwelt in brother branham in other words it wasn't brother branham that was doing the works it was the promise that god made to fulfill in him so god was only doing in prophet of god what he had already promised he would do in the prophet of god jesus ministry wasn't even fulfilled when he was here on earth there was a part of it left he came back and he says this they read the scripture he said this day this scripture to bind up the brokenhearted there was another part of his ministry to bring judgment which is happening in this day and so when they express that they're saying that was deity that was god in there that was all god yes sir but what happens is they take a terminology to express it that because of our vocabulary and the way we've been taught it it can't be comprehended as that because what you're saying to those that have that question when you use that expression you're saying that god changed residence he's not there by foreknowledge it's just like if if this was ocean water it's all ocean water it's a measure of ocean water it's not all the ocean in this cup but everything that that ocean is everything that that ocean has in it is in this bottle of water so what was in manifesting in brother branham was god it was all god it was a hundred percent god but it was only what god wanted to manifest himself for this age so all of it was god but only a measure of god was manifested he didn't change places so when you say the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt some somewhere that means he's not any place else he's only in this vessel now that's not what they're trying to express but they have a revelation of deity and they recognize it wasn't brother branham that did those works it was god that did the work and it was god doing his work but you with the minute you say that you break the other revelation that was revealed in brother branham and that's the part that we are going to come to so was it deity yes was it all god yes was everything that god was from beginning to end did god change his resonance notice he no longer lives in a house in heaven he's left heaven and he's come down and now he's only in here this is where he dwells fullness means all every bit everything of god well it's all ocean but it's only the measure of god now god could have he did he created in the prophet of god he spoke squirrels into existence he stopped storms he did everything in this ministry that he did when he was here on flesh it was all him that that the terminology is the problem because it there's other revelations involved okay and when you your desire of your heart is to express the deity that was veiled in flesh in our day and to look at that flesh man yeah that was william branham from from jeffersonville indiana from up from new albany area you know that that kid that ran around here that tim well that's what they did with jesus that's just jesus of nazareth but what god was fulfilling was the word that was prophesied for this day to be fulfilled that would only be seen by divine revelation that god would open your eyes through divine revelation you would look at that flesh and you would say that's more than william branham that's none other than the lord jesus christ himself using that body to do the things that he promised he would do it was all god fulfilling the word that he promised he would do in this age but to say that god changed his residence would mean that all the foreknowledge was all there and if i all i can tell you is is it was all god but you got to remember that brother branham was born in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies never was a lie in god what is one of the descriptions of god he can not lie end of story why was the fullness of the godhead bodily in jesus which among you can accuse me of sin there was no sin found in him no lies no nothing and this kind of goes to our our answer of uh what what's the difference between that well when you you got to know what each one of them is or what the difference are okay jesus was not born by sin he had a flesh body but he didn't come by sex he came by the word of god and so that's why we don't use the terminology the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt from brother branham because it sends a different message it and it by saying trying to express it that way then you lose the other things that were being expressed through brother branham the fact that sinful flesh could come to the place that deity could dwell in them and the same works that i do you can do also so you're no longer looking at what god fulfilled in in the seed coming to maturity and the same life coming up being manifested in the flesh you're saying no that was performed not by the plan of god but because god came down and dwelt in him fully in other words it was no longer william branham in any form brother branham hunted he fished you know a lot of people didn't think brother bram should hunt but he was a man that's not what he was pointing at it wasn't pointing at what kind of car he drove where he lived what kind of house he had what kind of food he ate he never pointed to himself now he might have preferred a four that's fine you know it's all there's all kinds of things that he did as a man you know i mean he hiked you know i mean i i wouldn't get up if he call me up say bird dave let's go for a 15 mile hike up the side of the mountains up here a pure to needle rock i would love to go i would start out man the guy traveled six miles an hour i'd say one thing before we start you lay hands on me you fill me with supernatural power because i can't do that and he could see he had the eyesight to be able to hunt to see i don't have that kind of eyesight i'm left-handed in my primary eye eyes my left eye gotta hold the gun on this one try to shoot her i got to hold the hand over my eye you know what i mean and it's hilarious no he was a man natural but what was doing that work in him was it is not i that does the work it's the father in me that does the work he had a great understanding of the deity spirit that he was in fellowship with that's the same thing jesus had read perfect faith he had a great understanding of the father in him i do nothing until the father shows me it's not i that does the work it's a father he learned that that spirit being that was dwelling in him that's the spirit that knew all things that's what made jesus omni present and omnipotent because the creator and maker of all things was his father he didn't come by sex and he had learned total obedience and surrender to that spirit so what was the difference between adam well i think the first thing to realize is we got to understand what adam was adam was a flesh man he was created by god adam he was a body a flesh man that god created he was born without sin right he was the first son of god and it god made him so he god could display fellowship and and display his attributes that that's what that adam was until the fall there was no sin in adam there wasn't he he was he had no sickness no pain he had dominion over the earth adam was what every son and daughter of god would have been if god didn't take the part of eve design her so she would be deceived that man would fall that god could explain his attributes we won't go into that token you first of all realize what adam was adam was the creation of of god in a form of a person man so that god could have fellowship he was flesh he took out of that flesh eve so we would fall that god could express himself in sin so adam was created without any relationship between a man or a woman and and he was put in the garden and left to have complete dominion so the first the difference between adam and melchizedek is melchizedek is what created adam all things were made by him and without him was nothing that was made made and uh so we're going to close up because we will never pick this up this evening and so adam was a man okay and and he he as we know he fell what's the difference between adam and melchizedek melchizedek was god he was god god was just a everything he was he dwelt alone and then with his thoughts and then he formed himself towards a body a person and from that person he went uh and created heaven and earth by the word of god that's why he knew all things brother ben expresses it this way if if i could say it now the difference between him and you as a we're talking about melchizedek here correct he says so let's just read this he says now melchizedek is god he said notice now his attributes okay this is paragraph 55 his attributes then the attributes was first god the thought the attributes itself so in other words god couldn't think anything but what he was because there was no other source of information nothing else to influence so what his thoughts were were his attributes but they weren't expressed yet the minute they be were expressed they the word god's thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed first just god alone and when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us john first chapter first first notice in the beginning before the eternal notice in the beginning was the word and when time began it was the word before it was word it was attribute a thought then it was expressed in the beginning was the expression the word now we're getting to where malchizedek is that's this mysterious people person in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and then the word became flesh and dwelt amongst us first was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophany that is called the word a body so that's melchizedek okay that's different than adam all right this is where adam came from watch the progression of god unfolding he said the word body this then is the state that he was in when he met abraham now when he meant abraham was called malchezadek he was in the form of a theophany so that that's the state he was in that was the form he was in when this great untouchable unseen god that he meant abraham he took on the form of a body and he meant abraham in in that state was the state that he meant uh abraham in that was the state he he was in when he meant abraham so if you turned over to a paragraph uh let me see do 64-65 have it there paragraph 64. there we go now god in this stage in this stage of his creation later formed in the flesh jesus from what from the great eternal spirit then came down to be word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoken out immorphy later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners when he meant abraham as melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of god of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing now but watch how we had to come now we see the attributes sons of the spirit have not yet entered into the word form body but a theophany is a body is subject to the words earnest and we went through all that the changing now listen here he says what's the difference between him and you as a son he was at the the beginning the word amorphy morphy means changing states he came and lived in that person of melchizedek then later he never heard no more of melchizedek because he became jesus christ he was a priest and and but he became jesus now you bypass that because in that form he knows all things and you have never been able to know that yet that's why when he took on the form of jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in jesus because the spirit that was in him was without measure that's distinctly laid out in the scriptures but you come like adam like me you become from attribute to flesh to be tempted but when his life is finished here it is earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become word we just become flesh man hey that's what adam was he was a flesh man that's what we are that's what jesus was he was a flesh man but he was a man without sin amen and and so he goes on he says in this paragraph 71 but you bypassed the theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin then if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we already have wanting we have not yet the bodies and that i wanted to see if i can find this just give me a second here so and and so we recognize that the the difference what melchizedek was he was god in a state and a form that he could fellowship abraham so the question was here it says when when when abraham meant melchizedek was in his theophany and fellowsh with him did he have his five natural senses well we know he ate we know he talked we know he listened to abraham green oak sarah said now he didn't need those senses but he took on the form of that because by doing that he was revealing to all of us what we would be so in other words and when jesus was here jesus had those five senses right he had those five senses but he was not in a glorified body he was in his sinful body is that what he said in other words he could die he could he could taste death he could do all those things that melchizedek couldn't so the difference between jesus and melchizedek is as melchizedek was god just in a form that he could fellowship and communicate with abraham so he took on a form so and by taking on that form abraham could know what all his seed faith would become so did he have his five senses yes he had five senses did he need them probably not because he was the creator of the taste he was the creator of the smell he knew all things and dwelt everywhere by for knowledge but he gave those senses as a means of communication and that's later what james said we touched them we felt them we handle them with our hands the lord of glory who could be touched by our infirmities so the only thing that i could pre pre zoom to that would be uh uh was yes because on paragraph 58 he says ethernet a theophany is uh look we'll go to paragraph 55. notice now his attributes then his attributes was first god's thought the attribute itself without being expressed secondary then it became the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us he and he says down here in 50 now ethanol theophany is something that you could not see it could be right here now yet you can't see it just like well like television it's in another dimension people are moving through this room right now singing there's color also but the eye is only subject to the five senses your whole being is only subject to five senses rather and you are only subject to what the site has limited to see but there is another dimension that can be seen by the transformation of television and and so we recognize um right there that this theophany was in another dimension so we're trying to take this dimension and express something supernatural in the understanding of this dimension but there's another dimension that that theophany lived in samuel moses and elijah all appeared in their theophany bodies they could appear and disappear they weren't subject to this flesh body adam was a flesh man jesus was a flesh man but he wasn't subject to the limitations of this dimension was a flesh man but he wasn't subject to the limitations of this dimension he created fish he walked on water he he moved like you know he walked through the crowd when scripture says i don't have the exact description but it was like he walked out into their midst and they didn't even know he was there he was a flesh man but he wasn't subject to this dimension adam was given dominion but he forfeited that dominion when he became sin so when jesus came to die he came to die to bring us back to what adam had forfeited so did when he appeared to have fellowship with adrian that he had his five senses yes he had his five senses but they were for abraham's sake not that he needed them question was jesus glorified body the same as malkie adax it had a lot of the attributes of malkiesidek but it wasn't exactly uh we could say like uh malcasidax because really it was more like adams because jesus had a fleshly body right it was tempted remember uh let's read paragraph 95 and then we'll make the separation between malpisodic and adam now the true revelation of malchezadec comes into view what he was god the word before he became flesh he was god the word before he became flesh all right let's jump up to paragraph 90 well right in the middle of 92. he says see he had become the word and was part of the word and he entered from the flesh life back into the body that was prepared before him before the foundations of the world he entered into theophany which was the word you get it there's where all believers go when they turn from here in this is 93 then in that form the veil then is lifted you see you are the word also when you enter into there you just got to read the whole sentence so when we leave this flesh we go into that theophany body where that's where god had the original thought of us and then we see where the word and a whole bunch of stuff will make sense okay now the true revelation of malchez comes into view what was he was god the word before he became flesh god the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him see i had father and mother you did too jesus had father and mother not mother the way we know it but jesus came by the same birth that we came by he was born in the world just like we were born in but god didn't use the egg of mary he he created both egg and seed in mary he was the father of of it all mary is not the mother of god see he had father and mother you did too jesus had father and mother but this man had no father or had no mother jesus had a time he started this man didn't jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life and it's the same man all the time i hope god reveals it to the same person all the time so the difference between malkie zadak adam and jesus was melchizedek was god he was the word he was a creator of heaven and earth now when jesus died and he was rose again the question is was his glorified body let like melchizedek well jesus was tempted i'm going to close with this this way later and i want to go jesus was tempted in every way that we were tempted melchizedek couldn't be jesus got sick he was a man he got tired he was a man but there was no sin in him he was the second adam a a quickening spirit so when and the question is is is about did he get the glorified body that that when god appeared that melchizedek is jesus glorified body like malchezadak's body melchizedek's body would come and disappear it would go okay jesus raised the same body that he died in now this is the difference if jesus was going to be adam's kinsmen redeemer he had to come in the same body that adam came in in order to redeem it back redeem means to be brought back so he's going to bring mankind this flesh body back to what it was when it was in the state of adam now let's look at adam before sin that body that adam had was glorified no sickness can you imagine no pain no suffering no emotional hurt dominion over everything glory i mean you can't even imagine the love adam must have had for eve he must have been like abraham and he said i'm gonna kill my son but he'll raise me up he must have known in his spirit because he came from god he had god's personality he had gods after him but he must have known if i go out with her god will have to bring it back and that's what he did i promise to put enmity between thy seed and the woman's seat so if you can imagine jesus said i have not yet been glorified he said don't touch me i haven't left or had i haven't entered back into that state where there's no sin no pain no temptation no suffering no death that's this body glorified so we go up and we have a body waiting for us that's our theophany body but then god is going to take that body and we're going to pick up a glorified body a body that's got flesh form that we can communicate and talk and taste and see and have fellowship and everything there it won't be it won't be anything sexual whatsoever there won't be a difference between man and woman and others neither bond or free male nor jew or greek in christ but we are all christ we're all there in person fleshly person just like what abraham was seeing what melchizedek was in a glorified state so the the body that melchizedek had was emorphae it changed it moved from melchizedek to jesus and then from jesus it it it moved in the form of the spirit and then we saw him show up again in this generation veiled in the ministry of the prophet of god so is it the glorified body of jesus the same as malchester it's the same in type it'll possess the same attributes but it'll be the glorified body will be a body like this fleshly body so it's really the promise was in the lord jesus they're so blended together that it's it's hard to separate them but it's not the same as mel keys of that but it is the same as what malchizedek represented and i i know that answer might not be good and uh enough but i hope that there will be some form of a trust in it so we see that the difference between adam was adam was the son of god placed here on earth in a glorified body with his own spirit jesus was a man that the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in to redeem us brother branham was a redeemed man tempted the way that we're tempted that god could dwell in and measure and manifest the word of god but what brother branham represents is the first fruit of what every true believer will come to to be able to take the rapture and and so we can touch on on a few more of these things and and maybe i'll just find and get a couple quotes this evening if you have any more questions but so the each one of those differences and why god did it that way is he's trying to manifest something in each one of them what he wanted to manifest in melchizedek melchizedek was just the beginning of it all then he wanted to manifest in jesus christ his love for us his deity joining with flesh what he wanted to manifest in the prophet of god is he has not forgot us he will restore us and he will bring us back and believe me that gospel has been lost in the church world today they asked a great evangelist today what's his secret to success why does he have thousands and thousands of people coming to his meetings he said because i don't preach against sin that's the next best thing to the catholic church catholic church is great you could sin as long as you showed up a confession and told the priest all your sins you can do almost anything for a few hail marys and a few glory bees but it didn't have eternal life so anyway lord bless you this morning we'll go through these i i know when we start talking i i know parts of the congregation are getting left behind and that really is hard on me you know because i think a lot of people can fend for themselves you know what i mean and and part of our job is to feed the lambs but those are the great things is why the fullness of the godhead didn't bodily dwell in brother branham because god didn't change his residence that's right you know uh was it did he have his five senses yes he came in a body like the body we're going to have the difference is those five senses won't have a carnal spirit to contact so those senses will never be temptation never be the lust of the eye never be the pride of life never lead to guttingly or heartburn or anything like that you know what i mean yeah we experienced that the other day didn't we yeah i couldn't eat another ounce and my precious brother just kept bringing me food that you couldn't resist so we won't have those type of senses there there'll be a different spirit connected with those five senses so every time you think of these five senses you think of them in this dimension those bodies are in another dimension so there won't be any temptation believe me you are not going to look in the mirror and think that you are too heavy that's right forget that or too skinny or bald i'm not bald my maker knows where every single one of them is and he can give him back to me anytime he wants but that's what we're looking forward to and that's why it's so important to live for him now but lord bless you this morning because those were just some of the questions that came up and uh and i know we kind of went through each of these answers but just to sum it up each manifestation that god had melchizedek abraham jesus and brother branham all were a significant purpose of god condescending coming from the word coming to adam coming to jesus tempted just like we're tempted laying down his life taking his life down and then coming in the prophet of god god condescending showing that he's with us all the way through and he's going to bring us all back to where we were in the first place and that's back to eden amen how many want to go back to eden and the only way back to eden is through the lord jesus christ i am the way the truth the life no man comes unto the father but by me i go to prepare a place for you if it were not true i would not have told you if if i go to prepare a place i will come again that where i am you may be also don't forget that friend no matter you know anybody's welcome to come to this congregation and serve god we have many different preachers we have many different types of service this was a different type of service this morning i'll be the first to admit that but he's the same and in living without him is is is i don't know how you do it i couldn't do it i wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for the grace and mercy of the lord jesus so god bless you happy father's day and i hope your crop pox didn't burn or wherever you go uh but uh the lord will be with you so god bless you this morning let's stand brother billy if you'd come the lord amen isn't god wonderful amen thank him for
