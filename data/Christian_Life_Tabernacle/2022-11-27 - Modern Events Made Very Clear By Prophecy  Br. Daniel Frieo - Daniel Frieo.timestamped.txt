[10:42] word amen
[10:44] why don't you just turn around and greet
[10:46] one another and welcome them to the
[10:48] house of God
[10:56] all right
[10:59] good morning
[11:02] just go ahead and
[11:04] bow our heads and we'll just
[11:07] open the Service in a word of prayer and
[11:09] commit the service to him welcome his
[11:11] presence Among Us
[11:14] father we thank you for your goodness to
[11:16] us Lord we thank you for your abundance
[11:18] Supply Lord in this period of
[11:20] Thanksgiving Lord how we thank you
[11:23] Lord for your faithfulness for meeting
[11:25] every need
[11:27] Lord for supplying even more than we're
[11:28] able to ask for giving us health and
[11:31] strength father and for directing our
[11:33] steps for making yourself known to us
[11:35] and drawing us unto you
[11:38] Lord how could we have anything but
[11:39] thanks for what you've done for us Lord
[11:42] we thank you for this opportunity to
[11:44] come together once again
[11:45] Lord of worship at your feet to learn of
[11:48] you
[11:48] Lord we're not here as a just simply as
[11:51] a religious ceremony that we might see
[11:53] one another and perform our religious
[11:55] duty but father we have an expectation
[11:58] Lord that when we come together we have
[12:00] committed this time to you Lord that you
[12:03] might have your perfect will that your
[12:06] word would be made known in us that your
[12:09] work would be accomplished in US Lord
[12:10] you know every need you know every
[12:13] desire and Lord we pray that as we're
[12:16] here this morning that you would as you
[12:18] promised you would come by our way and
[12:21] just meet us where we are Lord we commit
[12:23] the service to you in Jesus name amen
[12:27] but we're going to read Psalm 57 this
[12:30] morning
[12:33] and
[12:34] you know as you're turning there it's
[12:36] always interesting
[12:38] to me to see kind of the circumstances
[12:41] or the
[12:42] life experiences that are going on with
[12:45] David when he writes a certain psalm
[12:49] you know at least it helps at least me
[12:52] get a sense for what's going on in his
[12:55] life at the time that that some Psalm
[12:57] comes to his heart and comes forth
[13:00] and there's a little footnote a little
[13:02] introduction at the beginning of Psalm
[13:04] 57.
[13:05] it says he wrote this particular Psalm
[13:08] when he fled into a cave
[13:12] when he fled from Saul in a cave
[13:15] now I think most of us are probably
[13:16] familiar with the story it's in first
[13:18] Samuel 22.
[13:20] it says in verse first Samuel 22 1 David
[13:24] therefore departed dense
[13:26] and escaped to the cave abdullum
[13:30] and when his Brethren and all his
[13:32] father's house heard it they went down
[13:35] dither to him
[13:37] and we know the story
[13:39] David's on the Run
[13:41] you know he had achieved great victories
[13:44] victories that even the king of the land
[13:47] had been unable to perform and he had a
[13:51] life and a testimony that were beginning
[13:53] to draw the people unto him
[13:56] and this King began to recognize that
[13:58] this one
[14:00] might have the power to fulfill the
[14:03] prophecy which was spoken saying that
[14:05] your kingdom would be taken and given to
[14:07] another
[14:08] and so he goes out to and fro seeking to
[14:12] destroy him
[14:15] and you know it's
[14:16] in the middle of that that he runs to a
[14:20] cave David runs to a cave to hide from
[14:24] this one that would seek to destroy him
[14:26] he's in there hiding and he begins to
[14:28] write Psalm 57 verse 1 it says be
[14:31] merciful unto me o God be merciful unto
[14:34] me for my soul trusteth in thee
[14:37] yea in the shadow of thy Wings will I
[14:39] make my refuge until these calamities be
[14:42] overpassed and as you just begin to go
[14:44] through Psalm 57 you see as he's
[14:46] beginning to cry out that the Lord would
[14:48] keep him
[14:49] that the Lord would protect him that the
[14:51] Lord would watch over him and he's
[14:52] hiding in this cave
[14:56] and you know you can begin
[14:59] to maybe understand that in his hour of
[15:01] desperation
[15:03] when this trial when this attack is
[15:07] coming against him that his
[15:09] reaction is to hide
[15:12] fear for his own safety
[15:15] so he's hiding in a cave
[15:18] when he's been anointed to be a king
[15:22] and you know I suppose we all find
[15:24] ourselves in that place at some point
[15:27] it's only human nature some attack of
[15:31] the enemy comes against us whatever tool
[15:33] he uses to seek to destroy the overcomer
[15:37] that has the power to take his kingdom
[15:40] whether it's Financial whether it's an
[15:44] offense whether it's sickness whatever
[15:47] the trial may be
[15:49] and we can get lost in our circumstance
[15:54] we can get lost in our trial where we go
[15:57] and it's we hide in our little cave
[16:00] and everything becomes even our
[16:02] testimony becomes all about our trial
[16:06] our burden
[16:09] my
[16:10] circumstance
[16:12] and we begin to even have our testimony
[16:15] be how we're enduring in our trial
[16:19] and not about him
[16:21] and we become so focused in our little
[16:24] circumstance
[16:26] and we we put ourselves in a little cave
[16:29] we crawl into our little shell
[16:32] the little safe place that we build for
[16:35] ourselves
[16:36] and we hide there
[16:38] to try to protect ourselves
[16:41] from or in the trial
[16:45] and not only that if we're not careful
[16:47] we can build a little Fellowship of
[16:49] others around us a little Fellowship of
[16:52] that circumstance it's what happened
[16:53] with David in first Samuel 22. it says
[16:56] in verse 2 and everyone that was in
[16:58] distress and everyone that was in debt
[17:00] and everyone that was discontented
[17:02] gathered themselves unto him
[17:05] and he became a captain over them
[17:09] so here's David
[17:11] in his little cave
[17:13] with his little Fellowship
[17:15] calling upon the Lord to be his help in
[17:18] his little trial
[17:21] to protect him from his trial
[17:24] to protect him from his circumstance
[17:27] and it becomes all about the trial
[17:31] but you know what's interesting is there
[17:32] came a point in time where God sent a
[17:35] prophet David's way
[17:37] with thus saith the Lord
[17:40] and it says in verse 5 of first Samuel
[17:43] 22 5.
[17:45] and the prophet Gad said unto David
[17:47] abide not in the hold
[17:50] depart and get thee into the land of
[17:53] Judah
[17:55] you know as David prayed for God's
[17:57] protection and his deliverance and his
[18:00] keeping hand and you know just
[18:03] became all about God protecting him in
[18:05] his little trial in his little cave with
[18:07] his little Fellowship of suffering
[18:11] and the word of the word of God came on
[18:13] the scene it said the protection is not
[18:15] in the hiding the protection is the work
[18:18] you need to get to work
[18:20] you've been anointed to be an overcomer
[18:23] you've been anointed to be a king
[18:27] don't hide in your little trial or in
[18:29] your little cave
[18:30] with your little Fellowship that you've
[18:32] built around you around your
[18:33] circumstance but get out there and be
[18:36] about Kingdom Business
[18:39] you know and it's
[18:41] I thought about that about how many
[18:42] times I sit in my little cave of adulam
[18:47] where whether it's some offense or
[18:49] whether it's some trial or some burden
[18:52] or some hardship and I try to build a
[18:54] little safe place for myself
[18:56] and then I built a little Fellowship
[18:58] around my little circumstance
[19:01] and all the while
[19:03] I need to be about Kingdom Business
[19:07] you know thus saith the Lord to David
[19:09] was to get out of this cave
[19:11] get out of this little Fellowship that
[19:12] you've created for yourself
[19:14] and get to work
[19:16] the protection that he was asking for
[19:18] was in him doing the work not in him
[19:21] hiding from The Trial
[19:23] and I think that if we're not careful we
[19:25] sometimes
[19:27] forget that the protection comes from
[19:29] being about his business
[19:31] not from being hidden away in a place of
[19:34] safety
[19:35] and
[19:37] as Gad finished with us saith the Lord
[19:40] it's interesting to see as David's
[19:42] writing psalm 57.
[19:44] you know he goes from a cave hiding in a
[19:47] cave
[19:48] to verse 1 in the shadow of thy Wings
[19:51] will I make my refuge
[19:54] he goes from huddling with a little
[19:55] Fellowship
[19:57] to verse 9 I will praise thee O Lord
[20:00] among the people I will sing unto thee
[20:02] among the Nations see there was a work
[20:05] for David to do among the Nations among
[20:07] the people
[20:08] Kingdom Business and he couldn't do that
[20:10] hiding away in a cave seeking protection
[20:13] from The Trial
[20:16] being comfortable with the little
[20:17] Fellowship that he built around the
[20:19] trial and the circumstance
[20:21] you know and as we read Psalm 57 this
[20:24] morning there's one particular verse
[20:26] that stuck out to me in verse 2.
[20:29] says this I will cry unto God most high
[20:33] unto God that performeth all things for
[20:36] me
[20:38] not to me
[20:40] but for me
[20:42] and it occurred to me how often when we
[20:44] have a trial or a circumstance or
[20:46] whatever we tend to think that this is
[20:48] happening to me
[20:50] I'm the victim of what's being done here
[20:54] no it's being done for you
[20:57] God is performing all things
[21:01] for me
[21:02] for you
[21:03] and it's interesting that that's what
[21:05] David's thinking was at some point he
[21:07] came to the realization that though that
[21:10] ruler of this land
[21:12] may be coming against me to destroy me
[21:16] the same prophecy which said that I
[21:18] would overcome him was the same one that
[21:20] said I would sit on a throne
[21:23] and so rather than hide in a cave
[21:26] in the little Fellowship of my trial
[21:29] I'm going to be out there on Kingdom
[21:31] Business
[21:32] because he performeth all things
[21:35] for me
[21:37] and I have a promise
[21:39] so it just kind of struck me as I was
[21:41] reading that to maybe it's
[21:45] sometimes helpful to
[21:47] look at ourselves and make sure we've
[21:49] haven't built for ourselves a little
[21:50] cave of the doulam
[21:52] that we're hiding in when things get a
[21:54] little bit tough
[21:55] but we continue to be about Kingdom
[21:57] Business so let's just read Psalm 57
[21:59] this morning
[22:01] just a little Psalm we'll start reading
[22:03] together in verse one
[22:05] be merciful unto me o God be merciful
[22:08] unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea
[22:11] in the shadow of thy Wings will I make
[22:13] my refuge until these calamities be
[22:16] overpassed I will cry unto God most high
[22:19] unto God that performeth all things for
[22:22] me he shall send from heaven and save me
[22:25] from the reproach of him that would
[22:27] swallow me up Selah God shall send forth
[22:30] his mercy and his truth my soul is among
[22:33] lions and I lie even among them that are
[22:36] set on fire even the sons of men whose
[22:39] teeth are Spears and arrows and their
[22:42] tongue a sharp sword be thou exalted o
[22:45] God above the heavens let thy glory be
[22:48] above all the Earth they have prepared a
[22:50] net for my steps my soul is bowed down
[22:53] they have digged a pit before me into
[22:56] the midst whereof they are Fallen
[22:58] themselves Selah my heart is fixed o God
[23:01] my heart is fixed I will sing and give
[23:04] praise a wake up my glory awake Sultry
[23:08] and harp I myself will awake early I
[23:11] will praise thee O Lord among the people
[23:13] I will sing unto thee among the Nations
[23:15] for thy mercy is great unto the heavens
[23:18] and thy truth unto the clouds be thou
[23:21] exalted o God above the heavens let thy
[23:24] glory be above all the Earth
[23:29] praise the Lord aren't you glad we have
[23:31] a refuge

[51:47] always be in our hearts we just ask you
[51:51] to bless us today
[51:54] in Jesus name we pray
[51:57] amen
[51:59] amen God bless you I just want to read
[52:01] us one scripture to you this morning uh
[52:05] before uh oh I think I left my glasses
[52:08] in there but I think I can uh here I got
[52:11] a pair
[52:12] I'm afraid when I reach for glasses I'm
[52:14] going to pull out sunglasses
[52:17] and it it found over in Luke
[52:20] we have brother Daniel freyjo get a
[52:22] minister uh to us this morning that
[52:25] that's brother Shiloh's dad sister
[52:27] Karen's with us Mom God bless you sis
[52:31] good to see you and I appreciate our
[52:34] brother being here with us and and
[52:36] having this time of Fellowship together
[52:38] I thought it's Thanksgiving right and I
[52:40] just got to thinking of what what what
[52:43] is what am I most thankful for
[52:46] you know and I when I start to thinking
[52:49] of all the goodness that God's put in my
[52:52] life
[52:53] but I I got to thinking of this right
[52:55] here and it says
[52:57] fear not little flock this is Luke 12
[53:00] and 32 fear not little flock
[53:04] for it's your father's good pleasure to
[53:07] give you the kingdom
[53:11] and then I was reading in this message
[53:14] called three kinds of Believers and
[53:16] brother brand made this statement
[53:18] he said and today the very God that
[53:22] spoke of this age
[53:24] is on the scene doing exactly what he
[53:29] said he would do and they're too blind
[53:33] to see it
[53:35] and I thought my heart you know every
[53:37] age
[53:38] God gives the believer Something to
[53:41] Believe
[53:43] that separates them
[53:46] from everybody else
[53:49] it doesn't make no sense it's not
[53:51] logical it doesn't fit with Society it's
[53:56] just something that God puts out there
[53:58] and says believe this
[54:02] and there's something in you that
[54:05] believes it and I I thought what what am
[54:08] I thankful I'm thankful that I believe
[54:13] you know I of all the things I'm
[54:16] thankful that God let me see
[54:19] that that that he showed me in this day
[54:22] a little hippie boy in San Diego
[54:25] California that didn't have any
[54:28] connection the greatest connection that
[54:31] I had to God was the Catholic Church
[54:34] and that's got 666 wrote on it you know
[54:38] what I mean and the Antichrist sitting
[54:40] on the throne that was my connection to
[54:42] God
[54:43] and through it all
[54:45] you know what I mean he got his grace
[54:47] and his mercy and give me I sap because
[54:51] it was his good pleasure to give us the
[54:54] Kingdom look I thought Lord I want to do
[54:56] this testify I'm thankful today that God
[55:00] let me see and believe Lord help my
[55:03] unbelief increase my faith may I grow in
[55:07] you and all the things that you have for
[55:10] me may I just be a partaker of all your
[55:13] benefits and so we've asked our brother
[55:16] to speak to us today of those great
[55:18] benefits and uh and I told him
[55:21] um that he could sit down and preach to
[55:23] us if he likes so we'll just grab a
[55:26] chair and grab me that chair right there
[55:28] and he may not have to use it he may get
[55:31] under the anointing and run around this
[55:34] but I do know that he had a hip replaced
[55:37] here just last year so if you can't stay
[55:40] too long then I want to make him feel
[55:42] comfortable sitting down as you know I
[55:45] sat down last week so that was just the
[55:48] Lord
[55:49] God's wonderful and he got the memo

[58:39] God bless you all this morning
[58:42] good to be here once again
[58:44] and we've always enjoyed when we've come
[58:46] down and you've always been a very
[58:48] attentive group to minister to so we're
[58:52] just happy to be here once again we
[58:54] thank Brother David for this opportunity
[58:56] and maybe you'll turn with me this
[58:59] morning to the scriptures
[59:01] and we'll be
[59:04] reading from Revelations chapter 8.
[59:14] I'm sure it's a scripture well known to
[59:17] most everyone here
[59:20] and yet probably in the list of least
[59:23] understood it's it's probably on that
[59:25] list
[59:27] Revelations 8 and verse 1.
[59:30] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[59:34] there was silence in heaven
[59:36] about the space about half hour we'll
[59:39] read it once again
[59:41] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[59:43] there was silence in heaven about the
[59:46] space
[59:48] of half an hour
[59:49] let's pray Heavenly Father
[59:52] we thank you once again we believe every
[59:56] word Lord from Genesis to the last book
[59:59] of Revelations
[1:00:01] Lord and can we believe this book has
[1:00:04] been open to us
[1:00:06] Lord Jesus it's the revelation
[1:00:09] which is a personal experience that
[1:00:11] we're needing granted to each and every
[1:00:13] one of us in Jesus name amen you may be
[1:00:17] seated
[1:00:27] the question's always been uh
[1:00:30] and it will probably always be till God
[1:00:32] takes a bride home because the book open
[1:00:34] is the book closed has it been revealed
[1:00:37] has it not been revealed and and the
[1:00:40] question just continues on and on and on
[1:00:42] but I'd like to share with you a quote
[1:00:44] from the Brandon what he said in the
[1:00:46] first seal when he began preaching on
[1:00:48] this series
[1:00:49] of course it was eight it was 10
[1:00:53] services and eight days of of meetings
[1:00:56] and in the first seal he says this it
[1:00:59] begins in in paragraph 38 and he says
[1:01:03] and they're about 12 o'clock in the day
[1:01:05] the Holy Spirit just swept right down in
[1:01:08] the room and the whole thing just opened
[1:01:10] up to me because of this first seal
[1:01:13] being open so it declares that this
[1:01:16] first seal he says God has opened it up
[1:01:19] to us
[1:01:20] in the third seal
[1:01:23] paragraph 250. he's speaking on this
[1:01:26] third seal he's winding it all up now he
[1:01:28] says now the lamb has got the book in
[1:01:31] his hand breaking the seals he says he's
[1:01:34] broke the first one second one and now
[1:01:36] he breaks the third one and as he breaks
[1:01:39] it the lamb breaks it this third seal he
[1:01:42] goes on same
[1:01:43] so now by the time he gets to the third
[1:01:45] seal and he's closing it he says first
[1:01:47] seal second seal third seal it's broke
[1:01:49] it's open
[1:01:51] in the four seal paragraph 132 he says
[1:01:55] now there you are friends here's the
[1:01:57] fourth seal opened and the Riders of the
[1:02:00] four horses revealed revealed at least
[1:02:04] to him when he was done
[1:02:05] because Revelation is a personal
[1:02:08] experience with Jesus Christ the opening
[1:02:11] of the book is the work of the father's
[1:02:14] hands
[1:02:16] it's the work of the Lamb of God
[1:02:18] for it's the Lamb's Book of Life is what
[1:02:21] it was called so the lamb alone could
[1:02:23] open it
[1:02:25] yeah
[1:02:27] in the fifth seal
[1:02:29] paragraph 435 closing up on that service
[1:02:32] but the Brahm says I do think rather by
[1:02:35] the opening of this fifth seal as I
[1:02:38] believe that it's open to us I did it
[1:02:40] with good conscience with clear
[1:02:42] Revelation before God not trying just to
[1:02:46] think because I always was against
[1:02:48] organization it never would belong to
[1:02:50] them but it's open to me now
[1:02:53] okay
[1:02:54] the book
[1:02:55] he was telling us it's an open book
[1:02:59] when he preached on The Sixth Seal
[1:03:02] paragraph 143 he says did you enjoy the
[1:03:06] Sixth Seal
[1:03:07] you see where it's opened at now
[1:03:09] have you believed it he said who has
[1:03:12] believed our report and to whom as the
[1:03:15] arm of the Lord been revealed so now he
[1:03:17] connects Isaiah 53 with the opening of
[1:03:20] this word
[1:03:22] because Isaiah 53 was indeed the Old
[1:03:26] Testament prophecy of the first coming
[1:03:28] of Christ and the opening of the first
[1:03:31] seal
[1:03:32] then we jump down to stand in the Gap
[1:03:35] 1963. it's June now three months after
[1:03:38] he preached those seals and he says
[1:03:40] well it happens to be that at least one
[1:03:42] man is present this morning who was
[1:03:45] standing there when it happened speaking
[1:03:47] of what took place on Sunset Mountain
[1:03:49] those seven angels coming down he said
[1:03:51] could actually shook the Rocks off the
[1:03:54] mountain okay so we find out during that
[1:03:56] time
[1:03:57] I I saw seven angels in a form of a
[1:04:00] pyramid swept down and picked me up and
[1:04:02] I was brought East to open up the Seven
[1:04:04] Seals for God if you haven't got them if
[1:04:07] Jesus tarries my great-grandchildren
[1:04:10] little Paul's children that still will
[1:04:13] be the Eternal truth of the Living God
[1:04:16] now that was to find out what was sealed
[1:04:19] inside this mountain now he's speaking
[1:04:21] of those six dreams that he spoke of and
[1:04:23] serves as the time he says that wasn't
[1:04:25] wrote it had to be interpreted and when
[1:04:28] I come back he says the first angel in
[1:04:31] other words when I came back from
[1:04:32] Jeffersonville the first angel on the
[1:04:34] first night
[1:04:35] opened the seal contrary to anything we
[1:04:39] ever heard in our life
[1:04:40] and all seven came out the same way he
[1:04:44] said you know that
[1:04:46] you know that he said you were present
[1:04:49] when it happened many of you
[1:04:52] the book
[1:04:54] this Bible from Genesis to Revelations
[1:04:57] it is a book
[1:04:59] that God has opened up
[1:05:02] and sometimes we think it's a book that
[1:05:05] was just recently opened in 1963.
[1:05:08] but the first time that the book was
[1:05:10] opened the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:05:12] opened it and he opened it to Israel and
[1:05:16] Revelations 5 and 5 says can he he says
[1:05:19] John don't weep
[1:05:21] for the line of the tribe of Judah has
[1:05:23] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:05:26] the Seven Seals thereof
[1:05:28] so when was the book first open at the
[1:05:31] first coming of Christ who was the first
[1:05:33] to open it once again Jesus Christ the
[1:05:36] Lamb of God but he opened it to who he
[1:05:39] opened it to Israel he opened it to the
[1:05:42] firstborn son
[1:05:44] the lion took the Lion's Share of the
[1:05:46] fig tree
[1:05:47] and when he ordained his Twelve Apostles
[1:05:49] he said don't go to the Gentiles and
[1:05:51] don't go amongst the Samaritans go only
[1:05:54] to the house of Israel and take this New
[1:05:57] Testament and to John the Baptist it was
[1:06:01] told he would preach the Kingdom of
[1:06:03] Heaven no longer preaching the law it
[1:06:06] wasn't the law that Israel rejected or
[1:06:08] all the rituals that they had been
[1:06:09] involved in in their synagogue what
[1:06:12] Israel rejected was the word made flesh
[1:06:15] the word revealed the book open a book
[1:06:19] of redemption
[1:06:20] Seven Seals
[1:06:23] I'm going to simplify it because the
[1:06:25] language of the Bible is designed by God
[1:06:28] for a purpose to hide it from the eyes
[1:06:31] of the wise and prudent and reveal it
[1:06:33] unto babes
[1:06:35] but Seven Seals is Simply Seven parts of
[1:06:39] one Divine Plan of Redemption and
[1:06:42] restoration for the fig tree
[1:06:44] and for the bright tree
[1:06:46] it's a promise
[1:06:48] it's a new testament it's an open book
[1:06:51] of redemption of how to get back to Eden
[1:06:54] how to live in the presence of God
[1:06:57] of how to make him welcome in our
[1:07:00] congregations and in our homes
[1:07:04] turn with me to Revelations 5
[1:07:06] and verse 9.
[1:07:09] I would like to entitle what we'll share
[1:07:12] this morning is modern events
[1:07:15] made very clear by prophecy
[1:07:18] and we want to look at how prophecy is
[1:07:20] written in the Bible from one verse to
[1:07:23] the next and I thought one of the Prime
[1:07:25] examples of that would be in Revelations
[1:07:27] 5.
[1:07:28] Revelations 5 1-9 this Vision that John
[1:07:33] saw covers a period beginning back in
[1:07:36] Eden about 4000 BC and in nine verses
[1:07:40] takes us to the to the 21st century
[1:07:43] that's how prophecy is written
[1:07:46] Revelations 5 and 1 says can I saw on
[1:07:49] the right hand of him that sat on the
[1:07:51] throne a book written within and on the
[1:07:54] backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:07:58] historians can art archaeologists and
[1:08:01] all counting back from the birth of
[1:08:03] Christ to Eden and that day in Genesis 3
[1:08:06] 21 where the father was dressing Adam
[1:08:09] and Eve and lambskins that he had
[1:08:10] created Revelations 5 1 is said
[1:08:13] estimated to be about 4000 BC
[1:08:18] in Revelations 5 and 2. and I saw a
[1:08:21] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:08:23] voice who's worthy to open the book and
[1:08:26] loose
[1:08:27] the seals are up
[1:08:29] in verse 2 we fast forward now to the
[1:08:32] year 1446 BC because you see Visions
[1:08:36] have a lifespan just like you and I
[1:08:40] and a can a vision can be can be calling
[1:08:43] us of a period that that's just of 24
[1:08:45] hours of the vision can be a period of a
[1:08:49] thousand years the vision can be a
[1:08:51] period of two thousand years The Vision
[1:08:53] by a little comma can be broken up into
[1:08:56] two parts that are two and three
[1:08:58] thousand years apart and yet we read it
[1:09:01] as a single sentence right through and
[1:09:03] we never catch it
[1:09:04] and that's the way God designed to
[1:09:07] prophecy to be written so he could hide
[1:09:09] it from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:09:12] intelligent men with high IQs saying
[1:09:15] that's no way to write a book
[1:09:18] but God said it pleased the father Lord
[1:09:22] I thank you Father that you've hidden
[1:09:24] these things from the eyes of the wise
[1:09:26] and prudent who reveal it unto babes
[1:09:28] such as would learn
[1:09:30] so in Revelations 5 2 it says and I saw
[1:09:33] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:09:35] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:09:39] to loose the seals thereof
[1:09:42] in verse 2 we fast forward to the year
[1:09:46] 1446. it's Israel's 11th Hour the first
[1:09:49] Exodus has begun because the morning
[1:09:51] after the Death Angel The Pale Horse
[1:09:54] Rider sweeps through the Egypt and the
[1:09:56] angel of the Covenant a strong Angel
[1:09:58] which leads them out of bondage they've
[1:10:01] entered into a journey and it's a
[1:10:03] character building process for Israel
[1:10:06] Revelations 5 2 is the year 1446. so
[1:10:10] from one verse to the next
[1:10:12] the prophecy jumps
[1:10:14] over 2000 years
[1:10:17] but there's a reason the reason in is
[1:10:20] this Vision that John was seeing was
[1:10:22] simply showing God descending
[1:10:26] simply showing God changing forms for
[1:10:29] one sole purpose to get closer to you
[1:10:32] this morning
[1:10:33] from God the father and the throne with
[1:10:36] the book that was closed to the angel of
[1:10:38] the Covenant can start it moving amongst
[1:10:40] the people of Israel as the pillar of
[1:10:42] fire and a pillar of cloud
[1:10:44] but from one verse to the next a 2500
[1:10:47] year Spanish is jumped
[1:10:51] verse verse 3 of Revelations 5 can no
[1:10:54] man in Heaven Nor on Earth neither under
[1:10:56] the Earth was able to open the book
[1:10:58] neither to look thereon
[1:11:00] and I went much because no man was found
[1:11:03] worthy to open and to read the book
[1:11:05] neither to look thereon
[1:11:07] not only is the strong Angel leading
[1:11:10] them out he simultaneously looking for a
[1:11:13] man who is Worthy
[1:11:14] to open the book and loose the Seven
[1:11:17] Seals thereof
[1:11:18] this isn't two separate things though it
[1:11:21] sounds that way to loose the wax heel
[1:11:24] from a scroll or open the screw
[1:11:28] but the emphasis in the prophecy was on
[1:11:32] Seven Seals
[1:11:35] but the sealed was what held a scroll
[1:11:38] shut
[1:11:39] and when the seal was removed
[1:11:42] you didn't keep the seal that was
[1:11:45] discarded you opened
[1:11:48] the scroll and inside the scroll was a
[1:11:51] message a message designed just for you
[1:11:55] and just for me
[1:11:56] a message to changes
[1:11:58] to make us new creatures in Christ
[1:12:01] Revelations 5 and 5 says and one of the
[1:12:04] elders saith unto me weep not to Behold
[1:12:08] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:12:10] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[1:12:13] and to lose the seals are up
[1:12:16] Revelations 5 5
[1:12:19] the year's 30 A.D it's jumped another
[1:12:23] 1500 years just from a few verses down
[1:12:27] Jesus beginning his ministry at 30 years
[1:12:30] of age
[1:12:31] his third pole ministry as the lion of
[1:12:34] the tribe of Judah King of the Jews and
[1:12:37] the lion is taking the Lion's Share
[1:12:39] Israel the Fig Tree and is opening the
[1:12:41] book and loosening the the seals to
[1:12:44] Israel first
[1:12:45] what Israel rejected was given to a
[1:12:48] gentile church at the cross of Calvary
[1:12:50] Revelations 5 5 The Years now 30 A.D
[1:12:57] foreign
[1:13:01] so who and when was the seals open
[1:13:06] 30 A.D
[1:13:10] I received that by Revelation because I
[1:13:13] wasn't born yet
[1:13:15] neither were any of you
[1:13:17] but that's when God first opened the
[1:13:19] book
[1:13:20] that's when he loosed the seals
[1:13:23] as the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:13:26] extending A Plan of Redemption and
[1:13:28] salvation to Israel no more under the
[1:13:31] law
[1:13:31] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:13:34] but since John
[1:13:36] since that prophet
[1:13:39] he says the Kingdom of Heaven is now
[1:13:40] preached not the law
[1:13:42] not the rituals
[1:13:46] but the kingdom of heaven was now being
[1:13:47] preached
[1:13:49] it was no longer the preaching of an old
[1:13:51] Covenant it was a New Covenant it was a
[1:13:54] new testament it was a living way for
[1:13:58] the old way was was death
[1:14:00] but the new way was life
[1:14:03] that's the book that was open The Book
[1:14:05] of Life the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:14:12] Revelations 5 and 6
[1:14:15] and I be held can loan in the midst of
[1:14:17] the Throne of the four beasts and in the
[1:14:20] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:14:22] had been slain
[1:14:24] with seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:14:27] are the seven spirits of God
[1:14:29] sent forth into all the Earth
[1:14:31] Revelations 5 and 6 is in thousands of
[1:14:35] years ahead now
[1:14:37] Revelations 5 and 6 is just three and a
[1:14:40] half years later
[1:14:41] Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane to
[1:14:44] pray for one hour he entered the garden
[1:14:46] as king of the Jews and in one hour he
[1:14:49] came out from the Lamb of God it was God
[1:14:52] in morphe
[1:14:55] not changing forms as before but
[1:14:57] changing Ministry from here he's taken
[1:15:00] to Calvary on crucifixion day this is
[1:15:04] Revelations 5 and 6. just three and a
[1:15:07] half years later after Revelations 5 5.
[1:15:12] he has a ministerial change from Lion to
[1:15:15] lamb
[1:15:17] because the open book The revealed word
[1:15:22] these Seven Seals or these seven parts
[1:15:24] of one Divine Plan of Redemption that
[1:15:27] was offered first to Israel
[1:15:30] when they rejected at the cross of
[1:15:32] Calvary was given to a gentile bride
[1:15:34] we've got what they rejected and what
[1:15:38] we've received when God takes us in a
[1:15:41] rapture will be given back to Israel
[1:15:44] again a hundred and forty four thousand
[1:15:46] real genuine Sons and Daughters of God
[1:15:50] whose names too are in the Lamb's Book
[1:15:53] of Life
[1:15:54] for it's the lamb that's going back for
[1:15:56] them
[1:15:59] so this Revelations 5
[1:16:02] from verse to verse
[1:16:05] it jumps a thousand two thousand years
[1:16:07] from one verse to the next it doesn't
[1:16:10] read like any other book that you'll
[1:16:12] ever read
[1:16:14] it takes revelation
[1:16:17] it takes it takes prayer
[1:16:20] it takes meditating upon his word and
[1:16:23] blessed is he that meditates on this
[1:16:26] word both day and night
[1:16:30] Revelation 6 he dies he's buried
[1:16:34] he rises the third day
[1:16:37] and is amongst his disciples for 40 days
[1:16:39] then he ascends on high
[1:16:41] Revelations 5 6 it's 35 A.D and we have
[1:16:46] a symbol of a lamb as the doe had been
[1:16:48] slain before the very Throne of God in
[1:16:50] that seventh Dimension with seven horns
[1:16:53] seven eyes the seven spirits of God
[1:16:57] a slame lamb clam before the altar of
[1:17:00] God wherefore four thousand years
[1:17:02] Lucifer would stand to accuse the sons
[1:17:05] of God but that day on Calvary he was
[1:17:07] cast down there was a spot
[1:17:10] since the beginning of
[1:17:12] Eve where Satan was allowed to go
[1:17:16] to job
[1:17:17] and accuse the Saints and challenge God
[1:17:21] they serve you because you bless them
[1:17:23] they serve you because you give them a
[1:17:25] nice job they serve you because they
[1:17:26] have a nice car okay serve you because
[1:17:28] you have a nice Church
[1:17:30] God said I beg to differ with you
[1:17:33] let's take it all away and I'll show you
[1:17:35] who he is
[1:17:37] you see the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:17:41] in our own lives
[1:17:46] and there was a spot where Lucifer
[1:17:48] always stood
[1:17:49] to make his accusations before the
[1:17:51] people of God
[1:17:52] but that day on Calvary he was cast down
[1:17:55] and what ascended to that spot where
[1:17:58] Lucifer once stood now lays the Lamb of
[1:18:01] God interceding for us night and day
[1:18:06] we have access to the throne
[1:18:09] through Jesus Christ Our Lord and the
[1:18:12] blood that was shed for us on Calvary
[1:18:15] and never again
[1:18:16] will God hear a discouraging word about
[1:18:19] you before his throne
[1:18:22] here on Earth it's the greatest battle
[1:18:24] you ever fought
[1:18:27] because when Satan can't accuse you
[1:18:29] there anymore
[1:18:30] he comes straight to you to accuse you
[1:18:33] but know this that before this that
[1:18:36] seventh dimension in the very presence
[1:18:37] of God there's a lamb interceding okay
[1:18:45] in that spot now lays the Lamb of God
[1:18:47] Jesus Christ a sin offering so we could
[1:18:50] be his righteousness a healing bomb for
[1:18:53] our body Soul and Spirit changing us
[1:18:56] from the inside out through a born-again
[1:18:58] experience three steps of Grace to the
[1:19:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost refilling
[1:19:04] after refilling unto perfection
[1:19:07] and Revelations 5 and 6 the years 35 A.D
[1:19:12] we've moved we've moved in six verses
[1:19:15] from 4000 BC to 35 A.D
[1:19:19] it's how the prophetic word is written
[1:19:25] Jesus said father I thank you
[1:19:28] that you've hidden these things from the
[1:19:30] eyes of the wise and prudent can you
[1:19:32] reveal it to babes such as we're learned
[1:19:34] he's talking about folks that have been
[1:19:37] born again
[1:19:39] that's why Jesus told Nicodemus
[1:19:41] Nicodemus unless you be born again you
[1:19:45] cannot see the kingdom of heaven
[1:19:48] hmm
[1:19:51] so here the lamb is now opening the book
[1:19:55] to a gentile church
[1:19:57] it's his second coming
[1:20:00] the lion Ministry was his first coming
[1:20:05] in Revelations 5 and 7
[1:20:07] it says can he came and took the book
[1:20:11] out of the right hand of him that sat on
[1:20:14] the throne now it may sound redundant I
[1:20:17] thought in verse 5 he had already taken
[1:20:20] the book
[1:20:21] that was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:20:24] that was the first coming of Christ that
[1:20:27] was from the book was delivered to
[1:20:28] Israel alone
[1:20:31] the lion took the Lion's part the fig
[1:20:33] tree
[1:20:34] now the lamb is going to take the Lamb's
[1:20:37] part a gentile Church the bride of
[1:20:40] Christ now the book is being opened to
[1:20:43] another people
[1:20:44] now the book has been opened to a
[1:20:46] younger church that was born on the day
[1:20:48] of Pentecost
[1:20:51] remember the Old Testament allegory
[1:20:54] of Jacob took his two sons
[1:20:56] place the owl disk at Jacob's right hand
[1:20:59] the youngest at his left hand
[1:21:01] because it was the custom of the Jewish
[1:21:05] people
[1:21:06] and it can Jacob being an old man the
[1:21:08] Bible said blind
[1:21:10] to Joseph realize he's blind okay I'm
[1:21:13] gonna make this easy for Dad
[1:21:15] but the Elder said is right the youngest
[1:21:17] has left and Jacob goes to give the
[1:21:20] blessing to them The Lion's Share belong
[1:21:23] to the firstborn the eldest but Jacob
[1:21:26] crosses his hands and he gives the
[1:21:29] Lion's Share to the younger son
[1:21:32] the two boys
[1:21:34] represented two churches
[1:21:37] the Orthodox Jewish church and a new
[1:21:39] church a younger church that would be
[1:21:42] born on the day of Pentecost a gentile
[1:21:45] bride
[1:21:48] I know we've been told that a woman
[1:21:50] represents the church in the Bible
[1:21:54] but now here are two boys represent
[1:21:56] churches
[1:21:57] two young boys
[1:22:00] it pleased God
[1:22:02] to write it this way
[1:22:05] to hide it from the eyes of the wise and
[1:22:07] prudent so that this morning he could
[1:22:09] reveal it to you that you could know
[1:22:11] that God can do anything he wants to do
[1:22:19] I've caught myself because the younger
[1:22:20] man saying no no God wouldn't do that
[1:22:25] who am I to say what God could do
[1:22:27] Brother David
[1:22:28] okay well he does whatever he wants
[1:22:32] almighty God don't
[1:22:36] Revelations 5 and 7.
[1:22:39] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:22:41] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:22:43] throne
[1:22:45] the book was taken once
[1:22:48] and open to Israel
[1:22:49] Now by The Llama by the by the lion of
[1:22:52] the tribe of Judah
[1:22:55] now the book is being taken again
[1:22:59] it's really a ministerial change
[1:23:02] it's not redundant
[1:23:04] he's not he's not going to the same
[1:23:07] people twice the first time he went to
[1:23:10] Israel
[1:23:11] this time he's going to the Bride of
[1:23:14] Jesus Christ a gentile church and he
[1:23:17] came and took the book out of the right
[1:23:19] hand of him
[1:23:20] that sat upon the throne
[1:23:22] Revelations 5 20. the years 1963 A.D
[1:23:28] so between verse 6 and 7 once again is
[1:23:31] over 1900 Years and we're now in the
[1:23:33] 20th century
[1:23:35] he took the book is now February the 28
[1:23:39] 1963 on Sunset Mountain that's where it
[1:23:42] was opened
[1:23:44] Revelations 5 and 8. and when he had
[1:23:47] taken the book The Four beasts and the
[1:23:50] Four and Twenty Elders fell down before
[1:23:51] the lamb every one of them having Harps
[1:23:54] and golden vials for the holders which
[1:23:56] are the prayers of the Saints
[1:23:59] Revelations 5 8
[1:24:01] repeats again that he had taken the book
[1:24:03] because now it's March 17th
[1:24:06] 1963 and the lamb has once again opened
[1:24:09] the book revealing the seven seal book
[1:24:12] is open in Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:24:16] and we just read the quotes
[1:24:18] so between verse 7 and verse 8 is now
[1:24:21] only 17 days
[1:24:24] verse 9 of Revelations 5. and they sung
[1:24:28] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[1:24:31] take the book and to open the seals
[1:24:34] thereof for thou was slain and has
[1:24:36] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:24:38] every Kindred and tongue and people and
[1:24:41] Nation
[1:24:42] it's Revelations 5 9.
[1:24:46] and the years 2022.
[1:24:50] and the place is Dallas Fort Worth
[1:24:53] and the day is today
[1:24:57] think about it
[1:25:01] and the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:04] she sees it and is in a Revival of the
[1:25:07] just we are in a bright age
[1:25:12] some folks say no no brother Daniel
[1:25:13] there's only seven Church ages this
[1:25:16] isn't another church age
[1:25:19] this is a dimension where God wants you
[1:25:21] to live in
[1:25:22] while the rest of the world lives in
[1:25:24] laodicea
[1:25:25] and the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:25:27] she sees it and Sons and Daughters of
[1:25:30] God are saying Worthy is the Lamb Jesus
[1:25:33] Christ Our word Lord not worthy is the
[1:25:36] man Prophet Apostle teacher evangelist
[1:25:39] pastor but Worthy is the Lamb of God
[1:25:41] Jesus Christ Our Lord savior healer
[1:25:45] baptizer lion lamb king king of kings
[1:25:48] and Lord of lords
[1:25:51] turn with me once again
[1:25:54] to Revelations
[1:25:55] eight and one
[1:26:16] modern events
[1:26:19] made clear by prophecy
[1:26:23] Revelations 8 and 1. and when he had
[1:26:26] opened the seventh seal there was
[1:26:29] silence in heaven about the space of a
[1:26:32] half hour
[1:26:34] and that's all it said
[1:26:36] one short verse
[1:26:38] about this seventh seal
[1:26:40] or so we think it's just one verse about
[1:26:43] the seven seal but we'll find out
[1:26:46] shortly that there's a lot written in
[1:26:50] this Bible about the seventh seal
[1:26:53] in the message Christ is the mystery of
[1:26:55] God
[1:26:56] brother Branham speaking of his on his
[1:27:00] end time ministry how it was progressing
[1:27:04] and Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:27:06] paragraph 6 37 he says he says now not
[1:27:10] knowing he says of course being
[1:27:12] spiritual he says you watch spiritual
[1:27:14] things not knowing this God Knows It But
[1:27:17] if you'll turn and look at the clock
[1:27:19] it's on the dot to a clock
[1:27:22] the end of the second poll the third
[1:27:25] pull that is at hand
[1:27:27] a change a ministerial change was
[1:27:30] unfolding
[1:27:32] the third poll was the opening of those
[1:27:34] Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden Truths
[1:27:37] had been sealed in the word let me read
[1:27:40] you what prophet said about that
[1:27:41] statement
[1:27:42] in the anointing ones at the end time
[1:27:44] paragraph 262. he says notice the very
[1:27:48] day when this messenger not when he
[1:27:51] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:27:54] his message see
[1:27:55] the first pull healing second pole can
[1:27:59] prophesying third poll in the opening of
[1:28:02] the word
[1:28:03] the Mysteries revealed they're they're
[1:28:06] no no more there's no more higher order
[1:28:09] than to reveal the word than prophets
[1:28:11] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:28:13] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:28:16] the third pool was the opening of those
[1:28:19] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:28:22] that's been sealed in the word he says
[1:28:24] do you see it
[1:28:27] what happened on Sunset Mountain
[1:28:30] Prophet tells us and what is attraction
[1:28:32] on the mountain paragraph 148 what's
[1:28:36] happened about on Mount Sunset God
[1:28:38] confirming his word that's what all this
[1:28:41] noise is about notice it's God
[1:28:43] fulfilling his promised word again of
[1:28:45] Revelations 10 1-7
[1:28:48] and in the days can the sounding of the
[1:28:51] seventh angel message the mystery of God
[1:28:54] should be finished the hidden Mystery of
[1:28:56] Revelations 10 1-7 and the last message
[1:28:58] to the last Church fulfills exactly in
[1:29:01] this age Saint Luke 17 30 the day when
[1:29:05] the son of man should be revealed and
[1:29:07] there shall rise false prophets and
[1:29:09] false christs show great signs and
[1:29:11] wonders in so much that deceived the
[1:29:13] elected if possible these are the people
[1:29:16] still in doubt and as usual the church
[1:29:19] is just as puzzled
[1:29:23] 1965.
[1:29:25] June the 25th
[1:29:28] he says the people still in doubt and as
[1:29:31] usual the church is just a sponsored to
[1:29:34] all we don't want to be that church
[1:29:36] that's puzzled
[1:29:40] the prophet said
[1:29:41] I cannot over emphasize the need
[1:29:44] for revelation
[1:29:45] and Revelation is a personal experience
[1:29:48] with Jesus Christ
[1:29:51] the only thing that can hinder you from
[1:29:53] revelation
[1:29:55] the only thing that can hinder me
[1:29:57] is me
[1:30:04] let me say this that Revelations 10
[1:30:07] was the seventh seal
[1:30:11] Revelations 10. was the seventh seal
[1:30:15] that means instead of just having one
[1:30:17] verse giving us details on the seventh
[1:30:20] seal
[1:30:21] now we've got 11 verses
[1:30:24] from chapter 10 of Revelations
[1:30:27] listen to this
[1:30:28] the Feast of the trumpets paragraph 264.
[1:30:32] look I want to say one more thing
[1:30:34] closely now
[1:30:36] don't miss this and I'm glad he took
[1:30:39] time to say one more thing because I
[1:30:41] want to say one more thing close enough
[1:30:42] don't miss this how striking from the
[1:30:45] seventh Angels messenger of the seven
[1:30:47] seal message can Revelation 10 was the
[1:30:51] seventh seal
[1:30:55] everything in Revelations 10. are
[1:30:58] details
[1:31:00] of events and happenings under the seven
[1:31:03] seal now we don't have just one verse in
[1:31:06] Revelations 8 1. now we've got 11 more
[1:31:10] now we've got 12 verses of detail
[1:31:14] concerning this seventh seal
[1:31:16] what is this seven seal
[1:31:19] part seven
[1:31:21] of one divine plan and of redemption
[1:31:27] salvation and God wanting to change him
[1:31:31] and prepare you for rapturing faith
[1:31:35] remember Isaiah 40. it was the prophecy
[1:31:39] of the first Forerunner of the first
[1:31:41] Elijah to the first coming of Christ
[1:31:45] and it was spoken in detail of his style
[1:31:48] of ministry and what he would do
[1:31:51] he said he'll make a road
[1:31:53] a path straight for our Lord
[1:31:57] he said he'll come and he'll fill all
[1:31:58] the valleys
[1:32:00] he'll come and he'll cut down all the
[1:32:02] mountains
[1:32:03] he'll come and he'll make every crooked
[1:32:05] thing straight he'll come can he'll make
[1:32:08] every rough thing smooth
[1:32:12] and I go to the New Testament and I
[1:32:15] can't find where he did any of those
[1:32:16] things
[1:32:19] and yet
[1:32:21] I know he did it
[1:32:24] so I keep searching say Lord what is
[1:32:26] this
[1:32:27] and I think
[1:32:29] make the road straight
[1:32:31] that's a change
[1:32:34] that's a big change
[1:32:36] fill every Valley
[1:32:39] that's a huge change
[1:32:41] cut down every mountain and make it
[1:32:44] plain that's a huge change
[1:32:47] that's a change bigger than
[1:32:50] any construction company would want to
[1:32:52] take on
[1:32:54] make every crooked thing straight that's
[1:32:57] a huge change
[1:32:59] make every rough Place everything's
[1:33:01] smooth another huge change
[1:33:03] it was five things
[1:33:06] and then I get and the Holy Spirit just
[1:33:08] quickly now did you get it
[1:33:11] okay the five things that John
[1:33:14] the Elijah Ministry was to come to do to
[1:33:16] bring to Israel
[1:33:18] number one change number two change
[1:33:21] number three change number four changed
[1:33:24] number five change he was bringing
[1:33:27] change this man from everything they
[1:33:30] believed the way they worship the way
[1:33:31] the father treated his children the way
[1:33:33] the mother spoke to the dad the way that
[1:33:35] mother spoke to her teenage girls
[1:33:36] changed changed change you gotta change
[1:33:39] it all now that he's come and he's come
[1:33:42] again to bring us change
[1:33:46] change
[1:33:51] how many can say just a whisper change
[1:33:59] Revelations 10 7 he says it was the
[1:34:03] seventh seal
[1:34:07] 1963
[1:34:09] February 28th
[1:34:12] there appeared in a cloud in the heavens
[1:34:15] above
[1:34:17] I still remember the day
[1:34:20] I still remember a brother coming
[1:34:21] knocking on my dad's door
[1:34:24] he said you know just what just happened
[1:34:26] yesterday
[1:34:28] and he brought eight kind of a flyer
[1:34:31] from the University of Arizona
[1:34:33] the head of the science department there
[1:34:36] was a man named Jamesy McDonald
[1:34:38] and he wrote he wrote up a few pages on
[1:34:41] and the cloud picture and everything
[1:34:43] that we see in Life Magazine many of you
[1:34:44] have seen it and he wrote this
[1:34:47] an unusual cringe-shaped Cloud was
[1:34:50] widely observed over Northern Arizona
[1:34:51] near Sunset on the 28th of February
[1:34:54] 1963.
[1:34:56] from a large number of observers reports
[1:34:59] it is it is known to have appeared over
[1:35:02] near kedover Flagstaff Arizona from
[1:35:05] initial computations based on four
[1:35:07] photos taken in Tucson
[1:35:09] 190 miles south of the cloud and its
[1:35:12] altitude was approximately 35 kilometers
[1:35:15] the most distant observation reported
[1:35:18] was made 280 miles from the cloud the
[1:35:22] cloud remained sunlit for 28 minutes
[1:35:25] after local sunset
[1:35:29] the sun went down
[1:35:30] and the cloud remained illuminated
[1:35:33] for 28 minutes
[1:35:35] John told us
[1:35:38] and when the seventh seal was opened
[1:35:42] there was silence in heaven
[1:35:44] for about the space of a half hour God
[1:35:47] gave him that language
[1:35:48] they didn't have wrist watches then
[1:35:52] they didn't necessarily clock time as we
[1:35:54] clocked time John didn't even understand
[1:35:57] the statement he made because they
[1:35:58] didn't make no sense in the day that he
[1:36:00] lived about the space of a half hour
[1:36:03] what's that just ride it John
[1:36:05] but now we know
[1:36:08] science has collaborated
[1:36:10] and more specific
[1:36:11] it was exactly 28 minutes
[1:36:18] he said the cloud remains sunset for 28
[1:36:21] minutes after local Sunset iridescence
[1:36:24] was noted by many absorbers tentatively
[1:36:27] the cloud may be regarded as similar to
[1:36:29] our narcritious Cloud but it's unusually
[1:36:32] great height
[1:36:33] unusually low altitude
[1:36:37] plus it's remarkable shape suggests it
[1:36:40] was a cloud of previously
[1:36:42] unrecorded type
[1:36:46] unrecorded of science
[1:36:48] but recorded in God's holy word
[1:36:51] in Acts 1
[1:36:54] verse 7 to 11. let me read it for you
[1:36:57] and he said unto them it's not for you
[1:36:59] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:37:01] the father has put in his own power
[1:37:03] but you shall receive power after that
[1:37:06] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[1:37:08] shall be witnessed unto me both in
[1:37:10] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[1:37:12] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:37:15] the earth and when he had spoken these
[1:37:17] things while they beheld he was taken up
[1:37:20] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:37:22] sight
[1:37:24] and while they look steadfastly toward
[1:37:26] heaven
[1:37:26] as he went up behold two men stood by
[1:37:29] them in white apparel in verse 9 we have
[1:37:33] no reason to believe that it was nothing
[1:37:35] more than a cloud
[1:37:37] and when he had spoken these things
[1:37:39] while they beheld him he was taken up
[1:37:41] and a cloud received them out of their
[1:37:43] sight
[1:37:45] and while they look steadfastly toward
[1:37:47] Heaven as he went up can be told behold
[1:37:50] two men stood by them in white apparel
[1:37:52] which also said ye men of Galilee why
[1:37:56] stand ye gazing up into heaven this same
[1:37:59] Jesus is taken up from you to heaven
[1:38:01] shall show shall shall come in like
[1:38:04] manner as you have seen him go into
[1:38:06] heaven
[1:38:09] now we realize
[1:38:11] that this wasn't a cloud that took him
[1:38:13] up this was the same seven angels He
[1:38:17] said the way you've seen him go is the
[1:38:19] way you'll see him come again and he's
[1:38:21] come again in this day
[1:38:24] he came down
[1:38:26] the world still says an unusual cloud
[1:38:30] the prophet said no no no
[1:38:32] it was seven angels just look at the
[1:38:34] picture real closely
[1:38:36] and then turn it to the right
[1:38:38] and who is it
[1:38:40] it's Christ it's the Lamb of God
[1:38:43] it's Jehovah
[1:38:45] changing forms descending down for one
[1:38:48] purpose he wants to get closer to you
[1:38:56] Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he teach
[1:38:59] knowledge
[1:39:00] Whom Shall he make to understand
[1:39:02] Brockton them that are weaned from the
[1:39:05] milk and drawn from the breasts or
[1:39:08] precept must be upon precept precip upon
[1:39:10] precip line upon line line upon line
[1:39:13] here a little and they're little it's
[1:39:16] what we're sharing with you this morning
[1:39:18] line upon line here a little and there a
[1:39:22] little
[1:39:23] turn with me to Revelations 10
[1:39:26] and verse 1. okay
[1:39:31] this chapter that a prophet said this is
[1:39:36] the seventh seal
[1:39:38] that details
[1:39:40] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:39:44] from heaven
[1:39:45] glowed with a cloud
[1:39:47] and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:39:49] and his face was it where the sun and
[1:39:52] his feet as pillars of Fire
[1:39:55] and he had in his hand a little bit open
[1:39:57] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:39:59] and his left foot on the Earth
[1:40:02] when you see the cloud picture in Life
[1:40:05] Magazine
[1:40:07] um
[1:40:09] that's what took place here in
[1:40:11] Revelations 10 1.
[1:40:13] this Mighty angel came down
[1:40:16] the one with the swept back Wings he
[1:40:19] returned just as he had left the first
[1:40:21] time
[1:40:22] on that day just before Pentecost while
[1:40:25] they were in the going ordered them to
[1:40:26] go to the upper room and they seen him
[1:40:29] go in a cloud
[1:40:30] it wasn't just the cloud
[1:40:32] it was these seven angels once again
[1:40:35] and right here
[1:40:37] this is a nice salt another Mighty Angel
[1:40:39] come down from heaven
[1:40:43] close to the cloud and a rainbow upon
[1:40:45] his head I don't know if you've ever
[1:40:47] taken that Life Magazine
[1:40:50] it's almost to the end of the magazine
[1:40:52] where they placed it it's just one page
[1:40:56] the right little editorial notes on it
[1:40:58] and show the picture
[1:41:01] but immediately on the back side of that
[1:41:03] page was
[1:41:06] was another phenomenal event took place
[1:41:10] that they called the midnight rainbows
[1:41:14] it was a picture of a rainbow that
[1:41:17] appeared about 11 o'clock at night on
[1:41:20] one of the islands of Hawaii
[1:41:21] and a photographer it happened to be at
[1:41:24] the right place the right time with just
[1:41:27] the right photographic equipment to snap
[1:41:30] this picture
[1:41:31] of a rainbow that appeared at 11 o'clock
[1:41:34] at night
[1:41:36] eleventh hour
[1:41:41] and in this May issue of Life magazine
[1:41:44] 1963 they took both these pictures and
[1:41:48] put them back to back the rainbow and
[1:41:51] the picture of the cloud
[1:41:53] and when you lift up connect picture to
[1:41:55] the light
[1:41:57] you see the rainbow over the top
[1:42:01] of the cloud of seven angels what was it
[1:42:04] Revelations 10 1. what did Prophet say
[1:42:08] Revelation 10 was it was the seventh
[1:42:10] seal he says
[1:42:14] modern events
[1:42:16] being made clear
[1:42:18] by prophecy and the message 1965 this
[1:42:22] very same one by the same title
[1:42:24] from the Branham says this these modern
[1:42:27] events are slipping by us too swiftly
[1:42:29] and one day we're going to find out who
[1:42:31] will be left behind without nothing be
[1:42:33] caught shielding to the mark of the
[1:42:35] beast before we know it now and with
[1:42:38] patience we have to wait for this for
[1:42:39] the prophecies that's promised every one
[1:42:41] of them must be fulfilled in its age 44
[1:42:44] tells us the author has before done this
[1:42:48] and we wait to see him do it again what
[1:42:51] a time it is that we're living in
[1:42:52] something like a calendar you look at
[1:42:55] the calendar to find out what day of the
[1:42:56] year living can you look at God's Bible
[1:42:58] you see what age we're living in we're
[1:43:00] not living in a Methodist Baptist age
[1:43:02] we're living in the bright Age The
[1:43:05] Calling bringing back to God through a
[1:43:07] channel that he promised to bring it
[1:43:09] back in he promised to do it so
[1:43:12] Revelations 10 now not only did he call
[1:43:15] it the seventh seal now Revelations 10
[1:43:18] he's calling it The Bride age
[1:43:23] in the message this day the scriptures
[1:43:25] fulfilled
[1:43:26] brother Branham says this
[1:43:28] he says and I stood there a little bit
[1:43:30] till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said
[1:43:33] the entire Bible as much has been
[1:43:35] revealed to man through justification
[1:43:37] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost to baptism in Jesus name and all
[1:43:42] these things has been revealed but there
[1:43:44] are secrets that's hid inside because
[1:43:45] the Bible is sealed with Seven Seals I
[1:43:49] must go there to find it he said
[1:43:52] and that morning when those seven angels
[1:43:54] came down and blasted the Earth and
[1:43:56] rocks through her seven angels stood
[1:43:58] there and said return back to
[1:44:00] Jeffersonville
[1:44:02] from where you come from
[1:44:05] those angels told them to return back to
[1:44:08] Jeffersonville
[1:44:10] from where you come from
[1:44:12] do you know that statement isn't written
[1:44:15] in the Bible
[1:44:18] and yet he told us those angels tell
[1:44:20] them
[1:44:21] go back to Jeffersonville
[1:44:24] from where you come from
[1:44:26] did you ever wonder what John was
[1:44:28] prohibited to write
[1:44:31] could it be this
[1:44:34] how in the world you write
[1:44:35] Jeffersonville in Greek
[1:44:37] John didn't know what to write
[1:44:39] don't write it John because it's not
[1:44:41] your ministry because it's not this day
[1:44:44] because it's not the first coming it's
[1:44:46] the second coming it's the second Elijah
[1:44:49] it's a 20th century
[1:44:54] and when seven Thunders had uttered
[1:44:55] their voices I was about to write
[1:44:59] and a voice said to me don't write it
[1:45:01] John
[1:45:02] and folks say you see not even written
[1:45:05] don't even touch it don't go there
[1:45:08] but though it wasn't a written word it
[1:45:11] never ceased being the spoken word
[1:45:13] because once God speaks something it
[1:45:15] comes out of his mouth it will not
[1:45:18] return void to him
[1:45:22] what did he receive here A Spoken Word
[1:45:26] you can't find it in the Bible
[1:45:29] okay
[1:45:30] but we but God Vindicated what he said
[1:45:33] to him
[1:45:34] go back to Jeffersonville from where you
[1:45:36] come from for the Seven Seals the
[1:45:37] Mysteries will be open
[1:45:39] he says here we are today
[1:45:41] understanding serpency in a few days if
[1:45:44] God willing will understand the
[1:45:45] correctness of marriage and divorce
[1:45:49] and all these things that God has opened
[1:45:51] every seal the mystery since the
[1:45:53] foundation of the world can we've been
[1:45:55] enjoying the presence of his Blessing
[1:45:56] that's true then he says this day
[1:46:00] this scripture
[1:46:03] is fulfilled
[1:46:05] it's 1965.
[1:46:07] it's February the 19th
[1:46:10] he's talking about Revelation standard
[1:46:13] the seventh seal he says this day
[1:46:16] this scripture
[1:46:18] is fulfilling
[1:46:21] revelation 10.
[1:46:23] it was his coming
[1:46:25] his second coming
[1:46:30] I know there's a great debate on his
[1:46:33] appearance coming that's for another day
[1:46:36] but here he says it's just coming let me
[1:46:40] read it to you from the breach 1963
[1:46:43] verse paragraph 39
[1:46:45] . he said thou it's real mysterious
[1:46:47] because no man nowhere knows it God
[1:46:49] Alone Jesus Christ see now but he says
[1:46:53] but it is a book a mysterious book it's
[1:46:55] a book of redemption we'll get into that
[1:46:57] in a little while now we know that this
[1:46:59] book of redemption will not be
[1:47:00] thoroughly understood it's probed that
[1:47:03] through six Church ages but at the end
[1:47:04] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:47:07] his mystery he winds up all those loose
[1:47:09] ends that those fellows probed it can
[1:47:11] the Mysteries come down from God as the
[1:47:13] word of God reveals the entire
[1:47:14] revelation of God then the godhead and
[1:47:17] everything else has settled all the
[1:47:18] Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more
[1:47:20] is to be revealed
[1:47:23] now the book is open but the revelation
[1:47:28] has to do with your personal experience
[1:47:30] with Jesus Christ
[1:47:32] has to do with
[1:47:34] obedience
[1:47:36] has to do when you go deeper with the
[1:47:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:41] has to do with refilling after refilling
[1:47:44] of that spirit
[1:47:47] it's now you see I'm not just making
[1:47:49] that up it's thus saith the Lord I'll
[1:47:52] read it to you out of the book The
[1:47:54] sounding of the seven things will miss
[1:47:56] you the mystery of God should be
[1:47:57] finished and that's been declared by his
[1:47:59] holy prophets and that's the prophets
[1:48:01] who was wrote the word at the sounding
[1:48:03] of the seventh Church age the last
[1:48:05] Church age all the Loose Ends that
[1:48:07] through this church has been probed at
[1:48:09] will be wound up together can when the
[1:48:11] seals are broke
[1:48:13] and the Mysteries reveal down comes the
[1:48:16] angel the messenger Christ
[1:48:19] he came down on Sunset Mountain
[1:48:21] setting his foot upon the land
[1:48:24] and upon the sea footprints
[1:48:28] means possession
[1:48:32] he was told to Israel wherever you put
[1:48:33] your foot
[1:48:36] he says I'll give it to you
[1:48:38] put Prince's possession
[1:48:40] this Angel come down
[1:48:42] in the in a time of redemption he put
[1:48:45] his foot on the land Israel
[1:48:49] he's coming down for Redemption he put
[1:48:51] his foot on the sea
[1:48:53] a multitude of people a gentile people a
[1:48:56] gentile bride he's coming down for
[1:48:58] Redemption one foot on the land Israel
[1:49:02] one foot on the sea a gentile bride he's
[1:49:05] coming down for Redemption

[1:49:28] changed to be quickened by the power of
[1:49:31] the Holy Spirit to live a life worthy of
[1:49:34] the Gospel

[1:49:40] the seventh seal
[1:49:42] what is Revelations 10 it's the time of
[1:49:45] the Bride age
[1:49:46] what is revelation 10 it's his coming
[1:49:49] what does revelation 10 when the Seven
[1:49:52] Seals of God were opened there on the
[1:49:54] mountain
[1:49:55] what is Revelations 10 it's the third
[1:49:58] pull
[1:50:02] in the message the invisible Union of
[1:50:04] the bride of Christ
[1:50:07] mother Branham says this because I said
[1:50:11] that Revelations 10 was when the Seven
[1:50:14] Seals of God were opened there on that
[1:50:17] mountain
[1:50:18] sunset Mountain
[1:50:21] an invisible Union of the bride of
[1:50:23] Christ paragraph 301. President says
[1:50:26] this and the Seven Seals of God when it
[1:50:30] was opened there on the mountain
[1:50:37] and the Seven Seals of God when he was
[1:50:39] opened there in the mountain
[1:50:42] Seven Seals
[1:50:43] seven parts
[1:50:45] of one Divine Plan of Redemption
[1:50:49] to save you
[1:50:50] to heal you to restore you
[1:50:54] to take you back into his presence to
[1:50:56] leave it to live eternally with his
[1:50:58] family once again
[1:51:00] hmm
[1:51:03] he said and the Seven Seals of God when
[1:51:06] was it opened there on the mountain
[1:51:11] I thought it was opened in
[1:51:13] Jeffersonville
[1:51:14] no no they're on the mountain
[1:51:17] in Jeffersonville
[1:51:19] he began to bring the revelation
[1:51:23] of a book that was open
[1:51:27] he said then he says he said let God he
[1:51:31] said no no no let me die right now at
[1:51:35] this Pulpit if that ain't the truth 50
[1:51:38] years and I foretold you here in six
[1:51:41] months before it happened what he told
[1:51:43] me go to Arizona what would happen out
[1:51:45] there in the desert can there's men
[1:51:46] sitting right here tonight was standing
[1:51:48] right there in prison when the Seven
[1:51:50] Angels Came Down the magazine Life
[1:51:52] Magazine packed the article of it it's
[1:51:54] right here in the observatory can
[1:51:56] everything now they don't even know
[1:52:00] what it's all about
[1:52:03] that was 60th November the 25th 1965.
[1:52:08] here we are November okay
[1:52:12] 2022.
[1:52:15] and they don't even know what it's all
[1:52:17] about yet
[1:52:19] but there's a little bride
[1:52:22] there's an elect people
[1:52:24] their sons and daughters of God
[1:52:29] who are meditating on his word day and
[1:52:31] night
[1:52:33] and God is revealing this book of
[1:52:37] redemption to them because it's open
[1:52:44] the cloud was photographed
[1:52:46] on February the 28th 1963
[1:52:51] March the 17th 1963 William Branham
[1:52:55] begins the sounding of the seventh angel
[1:52:58] Ministry
[1:53:01] with God and simplicity
[1:53:04] March 24th he preaches the Seven Seals
[1:53:08] and 25 days have gone by
[1:53:11] so from the appearing
[1:53:14] of the cloud to the preaching of the
[1:53:17] Seven Seals
[1:53:18] was 25 days
[1:53:20] so from Revelations 10 1
[1:53:23] to Revelations 10 7.
[1:53:27] is 25 days
[1:53:33] because in the last days he said
[1:53:36] I'll have to make it a quick short work
[1:53:40] prophecy sitting
[1:53:42] for thousands of years
[1:53:45] at the end time and God unfolds it and
[1:53:48] brings it to pass in 25 days
[1:53:54] sometimes because we read in Revelations
[1:53:55] 5 2 000 years can pass between one verse
[1:53:59] to the next
[1:54:00] but here
[1:54:02] seven verses in 25 days
[1:54:10] because the father says
[1:54:12] my children need me
[1:54:17] the daughters of Zion need it
[1:54:19] I've got to move fast
[1:54:24] to change them
[1:54:25] what did the first Elijah bring to
[1:54:28] Israel change
[1:54:31] what is the message of the second Elijah
[1:54:33] to bring to us
[1:54:35] change
[1:54:40] why he was going to change us from being
[1:54:42] Catholics
[1:54:44] to being Sons and Daughters of God
[1:54:50] we didn't have to go to a communion
[1:54:52] service in the morning they'd pop the
[1:54:53] bread in our mouth and they'd drink the
[1:54:55] wine to the David
[1:54:57] foreign
[1:55:00] Don finished no we can have a personal
[1:55:03] experience with Jesus Christ now
[1:55:09] Revelations 10 1-7 in 25 days
[1:55:16] in the first seal for the Branham says
[1:55:18] paragraph 195.
[1:55:21] now then reformers know there was
[1:55:23] something wrong Luther know that that
[1:55:25] the bread wasn't the body of Christ and
[1:55:27] so we preach the just shall live by
[1:55:29] faith and that was his message and when
[1:55:31] John Wesley came along he saw that there
[1:55:33] was sanctification so he preached
[1:55:35] sanctification that was his message see
[1:55:37] the Pentecostals brought in the message
[1:55:39] of the Holy Ghost and so forth
[1:55:42] well the brand called it the Pentecostal
[1:55:45] age
[1:55:46] but the Pentecostal age was really an
[1:55:48] overlap
[1:55:49] from the end of it was a movement that
[1:55:52] began in the age of Philadelphia
[1:55:54] rolled over into laodicea brother
[1:55:56] Branham called that the Pentecostal age
[1:56:02] it's when methodists
[1:56:04] in the middle of the 19th century
[1:56:06] and started reading their Bibles again
[1:56:10] those that believe the message of Wesley
[1:56:13] and they get to the book of Acts and
[1:56:15] they say wait a minute
[1:56:17] sanctification by the spirit I believe
[1:56:20] it brother John Wesley well what about
[1:56:23] this Holy Ghost that's being talked
[1:56:25] about in the Bible
[1:56:29] it was Methodist looking for more it
[1:56:33] brought about about what's called the
[1:56:35] Pentecostal movement
[1:56:39] and that's what brother brand called
[1:56:40] Pentecostal age
[1:56:42] it was really a movement
[1:56:45] partially in Philadelphia partially
[1:56:48] it wasn't another age it was just
[1:56:51] William Branham calling it an age
[1:56:56] so that he could hide it not William
[1:56:58] Branham God so he could hide it from the
[1:57:00] eyes of the wise and prudent and
[1:57:02] revealing them to babes
[1:57:04] such as Woodland
[1:57:10] and the prophet said but in the last
[1:57:13] days
[1:57:14] the messenger is not to start any
[1:57:16] information but he should take all the
[1:57:18] Mischief those reformers left off gather
[1:57:21] them together solve them to the people
[1:57:22] let me just read it again oh it sounds
[1:57:25] so good I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:57:27] down from heaven clothes of the cloud or
[1:57:29] rained upon his head if his face was the
[1:57:31] sun his feet his pillars of fire now we
[1:57:34] saw that same thing which was Christ
[1:57:37] he's talking about sunset Mountain can
[1:57:39] we know Christ is always the messenger
[1:57:41] to the church all right he's called the
[1:57:43] pillar of fire the angel of covenants
[1:57:45] forth can he had in his hand a little
[1:57:47] book opened
[1:57:49] now the seals had done been broke here
[1:57:52] he's talking about the prophecy
[1:57:55] Revelation Cinema he said now the seals
[1:57:57] had done been broke there
[1:57:59] he's preaching the first seals and then
[1:58:01] he says but we're breaking them right
[1:58:03] now he goes
[1:58:06] pin the vision in the prophecy the seals
[1:58:09] have done been broken he said I just
[1:58:11] read your Revelations 10 1 and then he
[1:58:13] goes oh yeah he says why we're breaking
[1:58:15] them right now
[1:58:21] in other words
[1:58:22] this day
[1:58:24] in Jeffersonville Indiana preaching the
[1:58:26] verse Seal
[1:58:28] these scriptures fulfilled
[1:58:32] Revelations 10 3 and 4.
[1:58:35] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[1:58:38] lion roarth and when he had cried seven
[1:58:40] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:58:43] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[1:58:44] voices I was about to write
[1:58:47] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[1:58:49] to me
[1:58:51] seal up those things towards the seven
[1:58:53] Thunders uttered and write them not
[1:58:57] because the first thing the Thunder
[1:58:58] spoke
[1:59:00] was go back to Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:59:04] to open up those Seven Seals
[1:59:07] John was about to write it he said no
[1:59:09] don't write that
[1:59:12] first of all there's no Greek letters
[1:59:14] for Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:59:17] don't ride it
[1:59:19] but it remained the spoken word
[1:59:22] waiting to come down
[1:59:24] one date the turn of the 20th century
[1:59:33] the Thunder
[1:59:35] how many know
[1:59:37] that the Thunder was the voice of God
[1:59:40] when a seal opened
[1:59:45] in the first seal paragraph 263 brother
[1:59:48] Brown says it we found what that thunder
[1:59:51] means
[1:59:53] that's perfectly he says we know that
[1:59:55] see
[1:59:57] we all know that
[1:59:59] okay
[2:00:00] but he didn't stop there in case there
[2:00:03] was someone that didn't know it yet
[2:00:06] and he said the Thunder
[2:00:07] was the voice of God
[2:00:09] when the seal opened
[2:00:11] so
[2:00:13] what would seven Thunders be
[2:00:16] you do the math this morning
[2:00:20] Seven Seals
[2:00:22] that's what the Thunders was about
[2:00:27] and questions and answers
[2:00:29] number four 1964 it's August but the RAM
[2:00:33] said they asked him a question has the
[2:00:35] seven Thunders which equals seven
[2:00:37] Mysteries already been revealed and they
[2:00:40] were revealed in the Seven Seals
[2:00:42] but yet but are not yet known to us as
[2:00:45] the Thunders yet
[2:00:47] but the brand says no they were revealed
[2:00:50] in the sun Shields that's what the
[2:00:51] Thunders was about they was to reveal
[2:00:54] the seven Thunders that had uttered
[2:00:56] their voices and no one can make out
[2:00:58] what it was John knew what it was but
[2:01:00] he's forbidden to write it he said but
[2:01:02] the seventh angel in the days of his
[2:01:04] sounding
[2:01:06] that's a particular part of the ministry
[2:01:09] of the set of the seventh angel
[2:01:12] that was a ministerial change for this
[2:01:14] seventh angel
[2:01:16] okay because
[2:01:18] the seventh angel in the days of a
[2:01:21] sounding the seven Mysteries of the
[2:01:22] seven Thunders would be revealed from
[2:01:24] the seventh angel is the messenger
[2:01:27] of the seven Church age see
[2:01:30] what is revelation 10
[2:01:32] it's the Seven Seals
[2:01:34] what is Revelations 10 it's the bright
[2:01:37] age what is Revelations 10 it's his
[2:01:41] coming to the bride
[2:01:42] what is revelation 10 against the
[2:01:45] sounding of the seventh angel his third
[2:01:47] poem Ministry the revealing of the word
[2:01:50] what does Revelations 10 it's a
[2:01:53] heart-turning time it's not information
[2:01:56] not education Revelation a personal
[2:02:00] experience with a father made possible
[2:02:03] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:08] next position of the seven Church ages
[2:02:11] he says now this messenger of Malachi 4
[2:02:14] and Revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[2:02:18] things
[2:02:20] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[2:02:23] hearts of the children to the fathers
[2:02:26] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[2:02:29] seven Thunders and Revelations 10 which
[2:02:31] are the revelations contained in the
[2:02:34] Seven Seals it will be this divinely
[2:02:36] revealed mystery truths that literally
[2:02:39] turned our hearts of the children to the
[2:02:41] Pentecostal fathers exactly so he says
[2:02:45] but consider this also he says this
[2:02:47] Prophet Messenger will be in his nature
[2:02:50] and manners is where Elijah and John
[2:02:52] the people
[2:02:54] of this Prophet messenger's day
[2:02:57] will be as they were in ahab's day and
[2:02:59] in John's Kansas it's only the children
[2:03:01] whose Hearts will be turned pits only
[2:03:03] the children who will listen
[2:03:05] in the days of Ahab only 7 000 true
[2:03:08] Israelites were found in the days of
[2:03:11] John there were also very few the masses
[2:03:13] in both ages weren't fornication
[2:03:16] and idolatry as the masses today are in
[2:03:20] fornication and idolatry
[2:03:23] as Satan is trying to take you both
[2:03:26] young and old into fornication and
[2:03:28] idolatry
[2:03:31] but God
[2:03:33] rich in Mercy
[2:03:46] and the message is this a sign of the
[2:03:48] end time sir
[2:03:50] paragraph 314.
[2:03:52] he said brother Ram says now when he
[2:03:55] begins to sound
[2:03:57] speaking of the scripture in Revelations
[2:03:59] 10 7 the mystery will be finished now
[2:04:01] note then it's time for the seven seal
[2:04:04] voices of Revelations 10 to be revealed
[2:04:06] do you understand the congregation says
[2:04:09] amen when all the mysteries of the book
[2:04:11] was completed
[2:04:12] and the Bible said here that it would
[2:04:15] finish the Mysteries
[2:04:18] Revelations 10
[2:04:20] it's the seventh seal
[2:04:22] in relation 10 it's the bright age
[2:04:24] Revelation 10 it says coming Revelation
[2:04:27] 10 it's when the Seven Seals was opened
[2:04:29] there on the mountain February the 28th
[2:04:33] 1963 Revelations 10 it's when the
[2:04:37] seventh angel began to sound March 18
[2:04:40] 1963.
[2:04:43] read when the revelations 10 verse 5 and
[2:04:45] 6 will be closing soon
[2:04:48] and the angel which I saw set upon the
[2:04:51] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[2:04:54] hand to Heaven can swear by him that
[2:04:57] liveth forever and ever who created
[2:04:59] heaven and earth and the things therein
[2:05:01] and the and the earth and the things
[2:05:03] that are therein and the Sea and the
[2:05:05] things which are therein that there
[2:05:07] should be time
[2:05:09] no longer and the question rose up
[2:05:15] time ended with the preaching of those
[2:05:17] seals brethren
[2:05:19] no he says no no questions and answers
[2:05:23] 1964.
[2:05:24] paragraph 141 but I said if they ask him
[2:05:27] the question now if time ceases when the
[2:05:29] seals were open if time sees pardon me
[2:05:32] says when the seals were open then the
[2:05:34] Millennials also finish is it not
[2:05:37] no noises time didn't cease when the
[2:05:39] seals were open you misunderstood it
[2:05:41] what happened the Mysteries was revealed
[2:05:44] not time cease see watch real close now
[2:05:48] can we play your tape if you got it from
[2:05:50] a tape see
[2:05:52] but more and more we're getting quotes
[2:05:56] from each other
[2:05:57] and never going back to the table
[2:06:00] more and more before I get an
[2:06:01] interpretations and scriptures from each
[2:06:03] other never going back to the Bible
[2:06:09] go back and take the book
[2:06:13] from he that sat on the throne
[2:06:18] God wants to give you a personal
[2:06:21] experience
[2:06:23] with him
[2:06:29] he said no time never ceased this must
[2:06:32] be a post-millennius or something that's
[2:06:34] the question because we got a thousand
[2:06:36] years after church has gone home comes
[2:06:38] back upon the Earth then time ceases in
[2:06:40] the new heavens
[2:06:41] and in the new Earth he says and he says
[2:06:44] there will be there will still be sin
[2:06:46] after the Millennium the Millennium is a
[2:06:48] type
[2:06:49] of Noah going to the ark carried over
[2:06:51] brought ham and them onto the side and
[2:06:53] sin even come out of the Ark he says you
[2:06:56] see that
[2:06:57] Revelations 10 and 7. but in the days of
[2:07:01] the voice of the seventh angel
[2:07:03] when he should begin to sound
[2:07:05] the mystery of God should be finished as
[2:07:08] he declared to his servants the prophets
[2:07:11] in the message I have heard but now I
[2:07:14] see
[2:07:16] brother Branham says this
[2:07:18] now we're promised the church age to
[2:07:21] reformers we've had them but he promised
[2:07:23] Malachi for he'd keep his pattern in the
[2:07:26] last days
[2:07:27] always watch the pattern of the word
[2:07:31] find the pattern in the word
[2:07:34] because Jesus Christ is the same
[2:07:36] yesterday today and forever
[2:07:39] he said he's he said he'd keep his
[2:07:42] pattern the last days what would take
[2:07:44] place to turn the hearts of the children
[2:07:46] back to the faith of the apostolic
[2:07:47] fathers for that very purpose can the
[2:07:50] church is so brought broke up in
[2:07:52] denominations as isn't it's so toward
[2:07:54] who pieces till it's dead it's been a
[2:07:56] carrier then he promised in the hour of
[2:07:59] the seventh Angel's message the Seven
[2:08:01] Seals would be revealed and the
[2:08:03] mysteries of God would be declared
[2:08:04] Revelations 10 when the seventh angel
[2:08:07] begins to sound his message
[2:08:10] then he says not the healing service
[2:08:15] not the first pull not the sign in the
[2:08:18] hand not even the Discerning of the
[2:08:20] hearts of people that wasn't the
[2:08:23] sounding that wasn't the Fulfillment of
[2:08:26] verse 7.
[2:08:29] he said when the seventh angel begins to
[2:08:31] sound his message not the healing
[2:08:34] service the message that follows the
[2:08:37] healing service
[2:08:39] not the evangelistical services
[2:08:42] okay
[2:08:47] in the message the rapture
[2:08:49] reached in 1965 it's December the 4th
[2:08:54] he's got another 20 days and God will be
[2:08:56] taking him home
[2:08:58] he says this
[2:08:59] now there's a messenger above always and
[2:09:03] a messenger on the earth the English
[2:09:05] word angel means a messenger and the
[2:09:08] seventh Angel's message while he was
[2:09:10] making is proclaiming his ministry then
[2:09:12] when he began to sound forth his
[2:09:13] ministry not when he started out
[2:09:16] Jesus when he started out he started
[2:09:18] Healing The Sick and Afflicted oh the
[2:09:20] great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody
[2:09:22] wanted him in his church
[2:09:24] but when he sat down one day and said I
[2:09:26] and my father are one that was different
[2:09:28] that was different and except you eat
[2:09:30] the Flesh of the son of man drink his
[2:09:32] blood you have no life in it
[2:09:37] Seven Seals
[2:09:40] they were preached on March the 17th
[2:09:42] 1963 beginning with God and simplicity
[2:09:45] it was ten services in eight days March
[2:09:49] the 24th of that same year 1963 preaches
[2:09:53] the seventh seal so from February the
[2:09:55] 28th 1963 to March the 24th 1963 is 25
[2:10:02] days total
[2:10:04] from Revelations 10 1 to Revelations 10
[2:10:07] 7. fulfilled in 25 days
[2:10:13] you say no no don't hold it brother
[2:10:15] Daniel
[2:10:18] he couldn't do that he can do anything
[2:10:20] he wants
[2:10:22] he can put a comma
[2:10:24] and separate a sentence by over 2 000
[2:10:26] years
[2:10:28] remember Malachi 4 6
[2:10:30] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[2:10:33] before the great and terrible day of the
[2:10:35] Lord
[2:10:36] and he will turn the hearts of the
[2:10:38] fathers to the children
[2:10:40] that was the first Forerunner John the
[2:10:42] Baptist comma
[2:10:44] and the hearts
[2:10:48] of the children back to the fathers
[2:10:49] second coming of Christ Akama separates
[2:10:53] the very same sentence by how much more
[2:10:56] than 2 000 years
[2:10:57] you can't read it by a book it's got to
[2:11:00] be Revelation you must be born again to
[2:11:04] read this book and understand it
[2:11:07] exactly
[2:11:10] you must be born again
[2:11:13] to read this book The Bible
[2:11:18] then it's easy
[2:11:21] because God reveals it to you
[2:11:28] and the message influence
[2:11:30] it's November
[2:11:33] the 30th 1963.
[2:11:36] and the prophet says this in paragraph
[2:11:38] 109. he said what did John the Baptist
[2:11:42] do
[2:11:43] the man that Jesus said there was never
[2:11:45] a man born of a woman like him or could
[2:11:48] compare with him until that time the
[2:11:50] great prophet ordained of God before the
[2:11:52] foundation of the world spoke of 1200 or
[2:11:55] 700 years before he ever come on or 712
[2:11:58] years rather before he came to the Earth
[2:12:00] by the prophet Isaiah here what did he
[2:12:03] do when he seen a man come walking down
[2:12:05] out of the audience he looked up above
[2:12:07] and saw that fire coming down from
[2:12:09] heaven the form of a dove he cried out I
[2:12:13] have need to be baptized of Thee
[2:12:19] someone say Lord I have need
[2:12:23] to be baptized
[2:12:26] of Thee
[2:12:32] you don't need to leave this morning
[2:12:36] without a born-again experience
[2:12:39] you don't need to leave this morning
[2:12:40] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:43] and and you don't need to leave this
[2:12:45] morning without a refilling
[2:12:49] I should cover everybody
[2:12:51] wherever you are in your Christian
[2:12:53] experience
[2:12:56] remember Sarah
[2:12:57] she laughed in the tent
[2:13:00] Elohim was outside the tent with his
[2:13:02] back to the tent
[2:13:03] he said why did Sarah laugh
[2:13:08] Sarah says no no I didn't laugh not out
[2:13:10] loud she didn't put in your heart
[2:13:13] he said no yes you did
[2:13:16] she believed in God she loved God
[2:13:20] but she no longer believed
[2:13:22] that God would use her
[2:13:25] to bring a son to pass
[2:13:28] she didn't believe that God could do it
[2:13:30] in her that was the problem
[2:13:33] I'm too old and it's too late for me
[2:13:38] was the first time she left
[2:13:41] but the second time she left
[2:13:44] she was holding the center arms
[2:13:47] who would ever have known
[2:13:49] that I've given to a child at 90 years
[2:13:52] old my husband a hundred
[2:13:56] so on the basis of that
[2:14:00] this morning I can discern where
[2:14:02] everyone is at in the Christian walk for
[2:14:04] the day
[2:14:07] every one of you is somewhere between
[2:14:10] the first laugh
[2:14:11] and God gives you the last laugh
[2:14:15] did I get it
[2:14:17] yeah
[2:14:22] brother Ram says the great prophet
[2:14:24] ordained of God before the foundation of
[2:14:26] the world spoke of 1207 years before he
[2:14:29] ever come or 712 years rather before he
[2:14:32] come to the Earth by the prophet Isaiah
[2:14:34] where did he do when he seen a man come
[2:14:36] walking down on the islands he looked up
[2:14:38] above and saw the fire coming down from
[2:14:40] heaven in the form of Dove he cried out
[2:14:42] I have need to be baptized in thee I
[2:14:45] must decrease he must increase
[2:14:48] God can't have two on the earth at the
[2:14:51] same time only one has the message you
[2:14:54] know then he says
[2:14:56] I must decrease and then he says it's
[2:14:59] 1963.
[2:15:01] it's November the end of the year then
[2:15:04] he says
[2:15:05] he is the messenger
[2:15:08] then he says this I've been up to this
[2:15:12] time
[2:15:14] November 1963.
[2:15:16] I've been up to this time now he takes
[2:15:19] my place as Elisha when Elijah went up
[2:15:22] throw back his robe on Elisha his
[2:15:25] ministry was finished Elijah must take
[2:15:28] up where he left off he must increase I
[2:15:30] must decrease he said
[2:15:35] it's the end of 1963.
[2:15:37] and a great Revelation strikes the
[2:15:39] prophet
[2:15:41] and he's realizing
[2:15:43] I must decrease
[2:15:46] and he Christ must increase in the
[2:15:49] hearts of the people
[2:15:57] because he said
[2:16:00] he says he is the messenger
[2:16:03] then he says I've been that messenger up
[2:16:06] to this time
[2:16:12] but now he is
[2:16:14] he says I must decrease
[2:16:17] like the first Elijah said I must
[2:16:20] decrease he must increase because it's
[2:16:23] all about Jesus
[2:16:25] Christ in you
[2:16:27] is your hope
[2:16:28] of Glory and deliverance and overcoming
[2:16:32] power
[2:16:37] after the Forerunner has left the scene
[2:16:40] who is the messenger
[2:16:42] follow the pattern
[2:16:44] of the Holy Spirit Christ in his bride
[2:16:48] Christ in you
[2:16:50] as he wasn't a prophet
[2:16:53] can you say but Daniel how can Christ be
[2:16:55] in me like he wasn't a prophet
[2:16:59] because he promised you
[2:17:02] he said I'll be in you I'll be with you
[2:17:05] even to the ends of the world
[2:17:08] okay
[2:17:10] it makes you what it made him
[2:17:13] a son of God
[2:17:15] the ministry part because that's
[2:17:17] something else
[2:17:23] but the sun part and the daughter part
[2:17:27] that's why he's coming for you
[2:17:30] that's where you came from Glory
[2:17:32] that's why he was changing form from God
[2:17:34] on the throne to the angel of the
[2:17:36] Covenant took on a body of Flesh as the
[2:17:39] Son of God
[2:17:40] then come back
[2:17:42] as the Holy Spirit
[2:17:45] walking in the midst of seven Church
[2:17:47] ages
[2:17:48] looking for his children Greg Jehovah
[2:17:51] Eagle spreading his wings looking for
[2:17:53] you this morning
[2:17:59] and what follows
[2:18:02] a ministerial change from a one-man
[2:18:05] Ministry
[2:18:06] to the ministry of a many-membered body
[2:18:10] follow the pattern
[2:18:12] okay
[2:18:13] when brother Branham died
[2:18:15] what'd they say
[2:18:17] I heard them with moan ears what are we
[2:18:20] going to do now
[2:18:24] what are we going to do now they said
[2:18:26] I was just a boy I said uh
[2:18:30] I don't know
[2:18:31] what about Jesus
[2:18:36] the author and finish of our faith
[2:18:41] Revelations
[2:18:42] 10 and 8
[2:18:44] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[2:18:46] spoke unto me again John speaking said
[2:18:48] go and take a little book
[2:18:51] which is open in the hand of the angel
[2:18:55] which angel
[2:18:56] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[2:19:00] and upon the Earth
[2:19:04] not the seventh angel
[2:19:07] he's off the scene he's gone
[2:19:11] many of you were born years after he
[2:19:13] passed away in 65.
[2:19:17] where do you get the book from now
[2:19:20] go back to him
[2:19:22] to that angel
[2:19:24] who's standing upon the sea and upon the
[2:19:26] Earth
[2:19:28] get a personal relationship have a
[2:19:31] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[2:19:36] and a prophet tried to convince us of
[2:19:38] that
[2:19:39] November of 63. he said
[2:19:44] he's the messenger
[2:19:47] I was
[2:19:49] up to this time he says
[2:19:51] but I must decrease in your eyes now and
[2:19:54] he must increase
[2:20:03] verse 9 of Revelations 10 and I went to
[2:20:07] the angel and said unto him give me the
[2:20:09] little book he said unto me take it and
[2:20:11] eat it up it shall make thy Valley
[2:20:13] bitter but it shall be in thy mouth
[2:20:15] sweet as honey
[2:20:16] and I took a little book out of the
[2:20:18] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[2:20:20] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[2:20:22] had eaten it up my belly was bitter
[2:20:25] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[2:20:28] again
[2:20:29] before many peoples and Nations and
[2:20:32] tongues
[2:20:33] and kings
[2:20:37] Revelations
[2:20:38] 10 1-11 what is it it was that seven
[2:20:42] seal it is the bright age
[2:20:45] okay
[2:20:46] it is his second coming to us
[2:20:52] Seven Seals
[2:20:54] it's seven parts
[2:20:56] of one Plan of Redemption
[2:20:58] for the bright tree
[2:21:01] and for the fig tree
[2:21:03] let me read you one last quote
[2:21:05] the message from Revelations chapter 5
[2:21:08] 1961 barbanum paragraph 100 he says this
[2:21:13] and this seven seal book
[2:21:15] of of seven Redemptive plans has been
[2:21:19] brought to us
[2:21:20] and that's what this book holds now
[2:21:22] we're going to get over in the 10th
[2:21:25] chapter with his mighty Angel Proclaim
[2:21:27] something can I add a little book that
[2:21:29] John had to eat and when he did he got
[2:21:31] into his belly it was bitter but his
[2:21:33] lips it was sweet
[2:21:35] see when you have to digest it then it
[2:21:37] gets bitter everybody's against you
[2:21:39] everybody telling you you're a Holy
[2:21:41] Roller you're this you're that you're
[2:21:43] off your head so it's hard to digest it
[2:21:46] but when you're testifying of his glory
[2:21:48] it's sweet in your lips that's all see
[2:21:50] when you stand up can I meet and you say
[2:21:52] glory to God hallelujah so when you're
[2:21:55] going through that great Siege it's hard
[2:21:57] but when you're out of that great seeds
[2:21:59] you can testify of it then it sweetened
[2:22:02] the lips see that's right this that's
[2:22:04] this book
[2:22:06] of redemption as we stand to our feet
[2:22:09] this morning
[2:22:15] Revelations 10.
[2:22:18] one to seven
[2:22:20] unfolded in 25 days
[2:22:23] you say but then what followed
[2:22:28] a continuation
[2:22:30] of William branham's third full ministry
[2:22:33] all the way to the time when God took
[2:22:35] him off the scene in 1965.
[2:22:41] um
[2:22:43] God
[2:22:44] rich in Mercy
[2:22:49] sent the Forerunner this in the second
[2:22:50] coming just like he did in the first
[2:22:52] coming
[2:22:55] to bring change to our lives
[2:22:58] at the second coming
[2:23:00] just like he did at the first
[2:23:02] the ministry of John
[2:23:05] five things were itemized so we could
[2:23:08] understand his ministry
[2:23:10] so we so people could catch it and then
[2:23:12] he would come
[2:23:13] and yet the way it was written no one
[2:23:16] caught it
[2:23:18] it had to be revealed
[2:23:20] that's why Jesus in Matthew 11.
[2:23:24] verse 24 25 26. it says father I thank
[2:23:27] you that you have hidden these things
[2:23:29] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[2:23:32] and reveal it unto babes
[2:23:34] such as would learn it comes right back
[2:23:39] to what Jesus said to Nicodemus
[2:23:42] you must be born again unless unless a
[2:23:46] man be born again of the spirit of God
[2:23:48] he cannot see
[2:23:50] the kingdom of God
[2:23:53] Paul said the book of Ephesians Lord
[2:23:57] Open the Eyes
[2:23:59] of our understanding that we might see
[2:24:02] Jesus
[2:24:04] as we bow our heads
[2:24:05] Heavenly Father
[2:24:07] we thank you this morning
[2:24:10] for a quick short work
[2:24:13] that you've begun
[2:24:15] for these seven parts
[2:24:18] of a Divine Plan of Redemption
[2:24:22] to save to redeem to change
[2:24:26] a bride a bright tree and a fig tree
[2:24:31] [Music]
[2:24:33] Lord you've kept your word
[2:24:35] every promise made
[2:24:37] has been a promised capital
[2:24:40] and this morning you said
[2:24:44] that if anyone
[2:24:46] would have need of you
[2:24:48] if there anyone lacked this born-again
[2:24:51] experience
[2:24:53] if anyone needed the baptism of the Holy
[2:24:56] Ghost
[2:24:58] you need only bow your head and ask
[2:25:02] and God will give it
[2:25:05] God will shower it down on you
[2:25:08] God will touch that or God will change
[2:25:10] you
[2:25:12] well that's why a prophet coming this
[2:25:15] day
[2:25:16] thank you
[2:25:17] to bring change
[2:25:19] to make a path straight for the Lord
[2:25:23] to fill every Valley
[2:25:25] to bring down every Mountain to make
[2:25:27] every rough spot smooth and every
[2:25:29] Crooked Road straight
[2:25:31] what was it
[2:25:33] every one of them was a great change
[2:25:35] change change change change the Holy
[2:25:39] Spirit was crying out to Israel and they
[2:25:42] couldn't take the change
[2:25:44] they couldn't make the turn
[2:25:46] they couldn't climb the mountain they
[2:25:49] wouldn't
[2:25:51] but this morning Lord
[2:25:53] may you have a people willing to him and
[2:25:56] saying Lord Jesus
[2:25:58] Jesus say I'll do it
[2:26:00] [Music]
[2:26:02] the prophet give a testimony
[2:26:05] of a man who has been real real accused
[2:26:08] because he carried his Bible everywhere
[2:26:09] he went and he was a blind man
[2:26:12] they said if the Bible told you to run
[2:26:14] through that solid wall would you do it
[2:26:16] he said I would do it if the Bible said
[2:26:18] it
[2:26:19] so that be foolish knows because when I
[2:26:22] get to the wall God would make a hole to
[2:26:24] go through
[2:26:25] [Music]
[2:26:27] I just gotta walk by faith
[2:26:29] and not by sight
[2:26:31] Lord God bless your children this
[2:26:33] morning for their attentiveness
[2:26:35] May the word go deep into their hearts
[2:26:39] [Music]
[2:26:40] may they become students
[2:26:43] at the feet of Jesus
[2:26:48] may they do that take the advice that
[2:26:50] was given to us
[2:26:52] anyone here want to know how to get
[2:26:55] closer to God
[2:26:57] just read your Bibles
[2:27:00] and pray every day
[2:27:03] it'll take you there
[2:27:05] it's the path Back to Eden
[2:27:07] it's a path back into his presence
[2:27:10] [Music]
[2:27:11] father we thank you this morning
[2:27:14] bless your people once again
[2:27:16] bless this church the ministry Brother
[2:27:19] David and all his helpers Lord we ask
[2:27:22] all this now in Jesus name amen God
[2:27:26] bless you all this morning thank you
[2:27:31] foreign
[2:27:32] [Music]
[2:27:37] I you know I don't want
[2:27:40] uh you to get confused in any way by our
[2:27:44] our brothers
[2:27:46] Ministry you know trying to show you the
[2:27:49] word of God all this was planned before
[2:27:52] the foundation of the world
[2:27:54] and it was spoken and I I thought this
[2:27:58] morning
[2:27:59] especially for our young people
[2:28:02] if you want to know why we have a
[2:28:05] message
[2:28:06] you know how that quote unquote the
[2:28:10] message came to pass
[2:28:12] it's because God sent a prophet
[2:28:15] and the prophet began to go out in three
[2:28:19] pools
[2:28:20] right taking people by the hand
[2:28:23] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[2:28:25] the Heart And Then There came down a
[2:28:27] time where it came time to opening of
[2:28:31] the Seven Seals
[2:28:33] and when the prophet of God opened this
[2:28:37] Heaven seals like our brother said many
[2:28:39] of us weren't born yet
[2:28:41] but when he took that Authority
[2:28:44] that's when the church left them
[2:28:47] that's when everybody
[2:28:49] walked away
[2:28:51] but I thought it was amazing how how
[2:28:54] simple uh the Lord is and the Beautiful
[2:28:58] Things that he does
[2:29:01] when we open service we simply made this
[2:29:04] statement and today the very God that
[2:29:07] spoke of this age is on the scene doing
[2:29:11] exactly what he said he would do
[2:29:16] foreign
[2:29:18] can you imagine he was doing what he
[2:29:20] said he would do I wanted to put that
[2:29:22] quote up the one that our brother read
[2:29:25] uh it was out of um influence
[2:29:30] um
[2:29:30] and let me see if I can read it back
[2:29:32] there I can't
[2:29:36] he says
[2:29:37] I must decrease and he must increase
[2:29:41] God can't have two on the earth at the
[2:29:44] same time
[2:29:46] he said only one has the message you
[2:29:51] know I must decrease he is the messenger
[2:29:56] I've been up to this time now he takes
[2:30:01] my place
[2:30:03] [Music]
[2:30:05] as Elijah when Elijah went up
[2:30:09] and throwed back his robe to Elijah
[2:30:14] his ministry was finished Eliza must
[2:30:18] take up where he left off he must
[2:30:21] increase I must decrease
[2:30:24] John the Baptist and and
[2:30:28] I I thought it was so beautiful this
[2:30:30] morning
[2:30:31] because the message has been spoken
[2:30:35] now who is it that's revealing this
[2:30:39] message to you
[2:30:41] it's not the man William Branham
[2:30:45] it's none other than the Lord Jesus
[2:30:47] Christ himself
[2:30:49] revealing his word to you
[2:30:54] next so you wonder
[2:30:56] the Holy Ghost
[2:30:58] you know the only person who can receive
[2:31:01] the Holy Ghost is the elect amen
[2:31:04] it's all election
[2:31:06] he's elected you he's chosen you
[2:31:09] to take this great
[2:31:12] gospel that he preached that we look
[2:31:15] back we look back every single one of us
[2:31:19] this morning is looking back on the
[2:31:21] ministry of William Branham
[2:31:24] we weren't there on the Ohio River
[2:31:27] but we believe it
[2:31:30] you say how do you believe it because I
[2:31:32] today in 1922 November 27th I believe it
[2:31:37] is
[2:31:38] I see the evidence of what was spoken
[2:31:42] coming to pass amen
[2:31:45] don't you
[2:31:46] [Music]
[2:31:47] but who's opening your eyes
[2:31:50] who's giving you the isab who's allowing
[2:31:54] you to see who's quickening your heart
[2:31:57] who's touching you who's wooing you
[2:32:00] who's who's dealing with your heart it's
[2:32:03] him
[2:32:05] it's him
[2:32:08] Amen brother random he he didn't
[2:32:10] decrease in our respect no he didn't re
[2:32:13] decrease in our eyes he is Authority
[2:32:17] didn't decrease the absoluteness of what
[2:32:20] he preached none of that that decrease
[2:32:25] he he gets all the honor bestowed on him
[2:32:28] that God bestowed upon him look he he's
[2:32:32] not here teaching you and explaining you
[2:32:35] now
[2:32:36] it's God Amen the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:32:40] himself taking you back to what he spoke
[2:32:44] through his prophet and revealing it to
[2:32:47] you isn't that wonderful so so you you
[2:32:51] know you have a personal relationship
[2:32:54] because you're seeing amen what he said
[2:32:58] I love that and I thought when I started
[2:33:02] this morning I says that's what I'm
[2:33:03] thankful for I'm thankful that I can see
[2:33:07] amen and believe what that he spoke and
[2:33:10] then our brother comes up wearing a vest
[2:33:14] I thought that was pretty cool
[2:33:17] right and and basically it takes this
[2:33:22] back and I'm saying don't get hung up in
[2:33:23] all the dates you know only certain
[2:33:26] people have that type of ability to
[2:33:28] comprehend those things
[2:33:30] but he's saying to me I saw this time I
[2:33:34] saw this I saw this look at it happen
[2:33:36] between here and here prophet of God
[2:33:38] said almost how many percent of the
[2:33:40] Bible was fulfilled and how many last
[2:33:42] hours yes
[2:33:44] turkey's just showing that to us
[2:33:48] but don't miss the big picture
[2:33:51] that is him
[2:33:53] revealing to you amen and that's the
[2:33:56] relationship that we want to be in
[2:34:00] we want to be in the relationship of God
[2:34:03] revealing
[2:34:05] his spoken word
[2:34:08] to our hearts at the end that's why we
[2:34:11] have a message amen we have a message
[2:34:16] because a man opened this Heaven's seals
[2:34:20] and said this is the word of God all
[2:34:22] that's finished this is the teaching
[2:34:24] this is the absolute he Vindicated it
[2:34:27] with signs and wonders and here we are
[2:34:29] this morning
[2:34:31] amen waiting for his coming
[2:34:33] Hallelujah are you waiting for the
[2:34:34] Rapture yes

[2:34:50] the fact that all the scriptures is
[2:34:53] right on time amen amen God doesn't deal
[2:34:56] with the clock
[2:34:58] amen he don't have a calendar
[2:35:01] he's ever present every promise of God
[2:35:05] is present tense
[2:35:09] let me say that again every promise of
[2:35:12] God
[2:35:14] is present tense he's the same yesterday
[2:35:18] today and forever he's never changed
[2:35:23] everything that's happening here had

[2:35:29] before there ever was a star
[2:35:32] before there was everything oh Church

[2:35:36] it makes me feel like I'm wrapped up in
[2:35:39] his arms amen that I'm in the palm of
[2:35:42] his hands and nothing can pluck me out
[2:35:45] it makes me feel like my whole life
[2:35:48] even the hard times and the bitter times
[2:35:51] and the
[2:35:52] the sad times he knew all about it man
