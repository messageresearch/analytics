[15:45] keep pressing the battle that's what the
[15:47] Lord's been preparing his bride for
[15:49] times like these and what's what's most

[24:49] pray tonight
[24:50] amen amen
[24:51] [Music]
[24:53] we're gonna read two very familiar
[24:57] scripture reading
[24:58] let's read turn first in Psalm 27 and
[25:05] then we're gonna turn to another one a
[25:09] very very familiar scripture reading
[25:12] like I said I says the Lord is my light
[25:15] and my salvation whom shall I fear the
[25:18] Lord is the strength of my life on whom
[25:20] shall I be afraid when the wicked have
[25:22] in mine enemy and my falls came upon me
[25:24] to eat up to eat up my flesh they
[25:27] stumble and fail
[25:29] though though in host should encamp
[25:30] against me my heart should not fear the
[25:34] war should arise against me in this will
[25:38] I be confident one thing if I desire of
[25:41] the Lord and that will I seek after that
[25:43] I may dwell in the day in the house of
[25:46] the Lord all the days of my life to
[25:48] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[25:50] enquire in his temple so David is
[25:53] basically saying the reason why he's
[25:56] confident is because of his heart desire
[25:58] the his confidence comes from the fact
[26:00] that he knows that anything that all
[26:03] that he desires is that he wants to
[26:05] dwell in the presence of God he is in
[26:07] one gold it doesn't want silver all that
[26:10] his heart is after is the presence of
[26:12] the Lord he says for in the time of
[26:14] trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
[26:16] in the secret place of his tabernacle
[26:19] chellie hide me he shall set me upon a
[26:22] rock and and now shall mine had been
[26:25] lifted up above mine enemy around about
[26:28] me therefore I would offer in his
[26:30] Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing
[26:33] yay I will sing praise praises unto the
[26:36] Lord also let's turn to Genesis chapter
[26:40] 22 before we be seated Genesis chapter
[26:45] 22 I'm just gonna read it correctly from
[26:48] the printout that I had and verse 1 it
[26:54] says and it came to pass that after
[26:56] these things that God did tempt Abraham
[26:59] and said unto Him Abram Abraham and he
[27:03] said Behold the year I am Here I am and
[27:05] he said take now D thy son thine only
[27:09] son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee
[27:14] unto the land of moja and offer him
[27:17] there for a burnt offering upon one of
[27:21] the mountain which I shall tell thee off
[27:23] and Abraham rose up early in the morning
[27:25] and saddled his ass and took and took
[27:29] two of his young men with him and Isaac
[27:33] his son and and clave the word for the
[27:37] burnt offering and rose up and went unto
[27:40] the place which the Lord had told him
[27:43] then one one of the third it says then
[27:47] one then on the third day Abraham lifted
[27:51] up his eyes and saw the place afar off
[27:54] and Abraham sent unto his young man
[27:56] abide here with a ass and I and the lad
[28:01] will go yonder and worship and come unto
[28:05] you and Abraham took the words and the
[28:07] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac
[28:09] his son and he took the fire in his hand
[28:12] in the knife and it went both both of
[28:15] them together and Isaac spake unto
[28:19] Abraham his father and said My father he
[28:22] said Here I am Here I am I he says my
[28:26] son he said behold the fire and the word
[28:30] but there but where is the lamb for the
[28:33] burnt offering and Abraham said my son
[28:37] God will provide himself a lamb for a
[28:40] burnt offering so they both went both of
[28:43] them weren't together
[28:45] that's just my heads once again Lord
[28:47] we're so thankful to be gathered Lord to
[28:49] worship you we're so thankful Lord to
[28:52] hear the word even the word of prophecy
[28:54] father we could say tonight that we sit
[28:56] at the Brinks of things that we spoken
[28:59] many many years ago and now those things
[29:01] are becoming material before our eyes
[29:03] though it is such a comfort because when
[29:06] we see the things that we have heard in
[29:08] the natural becomes materialized Lord we
[29:11] know that there are other promises that
[29:13] are promised of the body change Lord one
[29:15] of these days those are also are going
[29:17] to become materialized and therefore we
[29:19] come before you and we call upon your
[29:21] name Lord that you come and you help us
[29:23] in this time because we have need of you
[29:25] we love you and commit everything we are
[29:27] to you in the name of Jesus Christ we
[29:29] pray amen amen god bless you may have
[29:31] your seats before we get just deep into
[29:38] this I was thinking about just some of
[29:41] the things or pastors been talking about
[29:43] you know hopefully I could just echo
[29:47] some of them perhaps in a different
[29:49] direction but certainly want to echo
[29:52] some of the things we heard it's
[29:54] speaking about the great contrast that's
[29:56] being
[29:56] this ting in this just last couple of
[29:59] weeks and and life changed forever
[30:03] perhaps this will go away you know and
[30:06] and we'll get back to normal but but
[30:09] nevertheless than normal will not be
[30:11] normal anymore they're not sure if all
[30:13] people will be comfortable shaking hands
[30:15] or doing all kinds of things and you
[30:17] never know what's gonna happen after
[30:19] this because the events like this they
[30:20] stay they stay within people and their
[30:23] mind so I was just looking I went and I
[30:25] was looking just the different pandemics
[30:28] and things that has happened in history
[30:30] it's amazing just a number of things
[30:33] that has happened and taking places and
[30:35] how many people were affected I'll just
[30:37] go quickly through a couple of them so
[30:39] we don't waste a lot of time in 1915 and
[30:43] 20 there was what what is known as the
[30:45] smallpox and he killed about 56 million
[30:49] people in the 17th century there was
[30:52] what was known as the Great Plague it
[30:54] was about 3 million in the 1600 and then
[30:58] in the 18th century in the 1700s there
[31:00] was about 600,000 died in the Great
[31:03] Plague and then there was the cholera
[31:05] outbreak that killed about 1 million in
[31:08] 1817 until 1923 it was another one
[31:13] called the third plague that killed
[31:14] about 12 million in 18 and 55 the yellow
[31:18] fever in the late 1800s was between a
[31:22] hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand
[31:24] the HIV from 19 and 81 until presently
[31:28] it's killed between 25 to 35 million now
[31:32] I want you to just realize these numbers
[31:35] just the massive numbers and you can
[31:38] even you know I was thinking how can you
[31:40] say between 25 and 35 million what
[31:43] happened to the ten million like
[31:45] somebody didn't count correctly oh you
[31:47] know how can you just give a number and
[31:49] you come to realize it was a great
[31:51] something that affected people greatly
[31:53] and and because of those things people
[31:56] live differently today people's behavior
[31:59] has been modified and and people's way
[32:01] of acting has been modified there was
[32:04] what was known as the Asian flu about
[32:06] 1.1 million this is in nineteen and
[32:09] fifty seven
[32:10] nineteen and fifty-eight the Hong Kong
[32:12] flu was in 1968 between 1968 and 1917
[32:18] 1970 it was about took about 1 million
[32:22] and then it was one that is named known
[32:25] as the Black Death it was about 200
[32:28] million this is between the years of 13
[32:32] 47 and 13 and 51 so we could certainly
[32:36] realize that these these things they
[32:40] certainly have a pattern they come and
[32:42] they go and and and plugs they come and
[32:45] they go and they happen and the wonder
[32:47] we currently have it's they saying that
[32:49] there's about 700 and 8,000 people
[32:51] infected the death the total death is
[32:54] about thirty three hundred five hundred
[32:56] and twenty-nine and is about 150
[32:59] thousand seven hundred and thirty-four
[33:01] people that have recovered so far so and
[33:04] we stole and the numbers are still
[33:06] counting you realize they saying that
[33:09] the unemployment rate in one month
[33:12] jumped between three point five percent
[33:15] to five point five percent in one month
[33:17] just in one month and it continues its
[33:20] continuing depending on what trajectory
[33:23] this takes you you think about the
[33:26] shortage of nurses and doctors they
[33:28] speaking about mobilizing and getting
[33:31] all the retired nurses and doctors back
[33:33] into work and because they need as much
[33:36] help as they could get and and and you
[33:38] think about even those though I was even
[33:41] trying to get the numbers about the
[33:42] nurses and the doctors that have been
[33:44] affected by this coronavirus and died
[33:47] there's a lot of people that have laid
[33:48] their life on the line and you think
[33:50] about the FEMA and the state
[33:52] mobilization the United States Corps of
[33:55] Engineers being mobilized do you think
[33:57] about just everybody invoking privileges
[34:03] even the president in voting privileges
[34:05] I've never been invoked since the Cold
[34:08] War and all kinds of things so you could
[34:10] certainly say that this is a time of
[34:12] crisis and we sit here and and and we
[34:15] certainly are affected by it we are
[34:18] affected by it
[34:20] not something that is just pretending to
[34:22] unbeliever or to believe it this is the
[34:24] whole wall that's being affected by it
[34:26] and and so you become to realize this is
[34:29] something that affects us all it affects
[34:32] people are being laid off of jobs and
[34:34] ICUs are filled with people you couldn't
[34:37] go to an emergency room they tell you
[34:39] not to go call your local doctor if you
[34:41] if you need a test you call your local
[34:43] doctor they tell you there's nothing for
[34:45] you to test right now and all so it's a
[34:47] time of great chaos and so I begin to
[34:50] think within my heart you know even as
[34:52] Christians what should be our role and
[34:54] what should be doing and and things like
[34:56] that and I began to think about the
[34:58] Bible and the scripture and about the
[35:00] great time of crisis that the Scriptures
[35:03] speak about and what God did in the
[35:05] great time of crisis when his children
[35:07] couple call upon him and so because it
[35:10] become something that I just was
[35:13] reasoning with in my own heart
[35:14] no doubt we you know we try to set this
[35:18] within the timeframe of the church and
[35:21] where we are and what time we live in in
[35:24] we understand that this is perhaps not
[35:28] clearly defined even that's why we say
[35:31] it is such a strange thing because we
[35:33] couldn't say it's necessarily the
[35:36] squeeze because you realize that this is
[35:37] affecting everybody they're not just
[35:39] searching down the churches you could
[35:41] see that and then you can see it's the
[35:43] perhaps the beginning of tribulation or
[35:45] things like that but you realize that
[35:47] the bride will not be here for the
[35:49] tribulation so it's something that it's
[35:52] very strange and and and and and we
[35:55] trying to figure out what's going on and
[35:57] what's happening but I want to say this
[35:59] as Christians our heart I always turned
[36:02] towards the Word of God and our hearts
[36:04] are always turned towards God and we
[36:06] need to make sure that everything that
[36:08] we are doing we are doing and we are
[36:10] being drawn back to the Word of God our
[36:12] pastor talked about it's time that we
[36:14] move forward in faith because we realize
[36:17] as we look at the statistics and this
[36:20] numbers the first thing that come upon
[36:22] people is fear or what's gonna happen we
[36:25] don't know what's happening tomorrow we
[36:27] don't know what's happening the next
[36:28] week and no one can
[36:30] tell you what's gonna happen two weeks
[36:31] from now and and so people are crippled
[36:34] and they don't know whether they should
[36:35] work or not working we know but we
[36:38] realize as Christians we don't walk by
[36:40] fear but we love my faith and then at
[36:42] the same time as the contrast is being
[36:45] drawn they said people as even as we
[36:47] heard this morning that have received a
[36:49] witness and they are walking with the
[36:52] witness that I've received you know I
[36:54] just don't want to get ahead of myself
[36:56] right now but we have to come to a place
[36:58] where we realize either God is God or
[37:01] it's not God if their God is what gonna
[37:04] do what they promised so it's not gonna
[37:05] do any promise and what makes them God
[37:08] is the fact that what he promised you
[37:10] will do that's what you'll do now so we
[37:13] as we looked at the statistics then we
[37:16] realize as our pastor spoke this morning
[37:18] we can say certainly without a doubt
[37:21] that even men the greatest invention of
[37:24] men is vanity you can look at the
[37:27] skyscrapers we fly into the air we have
[37:30] a man hanging into the sky we do all
[37:33] kinds of things were built highways and
[37:35] we have regretted some medicine areas
[37:38] and all kinds of things and we pride
[37:40] ourselves in the men's invention we
[37:43] learned from their technology and
[37:44] everything and yet something this small
[37:46] takes the whole thing apart fix the
[37:49] whole system of the economy or
[37:51] everything shuts down in a matter of
[37:54] weeks and it's just come to show you
[37:57] that everything that man does is
[37:59] temporal nothing man builds is permanent
[38:02] whatever that's why you cannot put your
[38:04] trust in man that scripture tells us to
[38:06] put trust in man is death but to put
[38:09] trust in God is life
[38:11] we cannot walk by them thinking of men
[38:14] and however easy it makes your lives
[38:17] that have been building up the cars and
[38:19] the houses the comfort that we get off
[38:21] of it and everything but we realize that
[38:23] everything that man does has an ending
[38:25] why because he has a beginning but we
[38:28] stand before one that we heard this
[38:30] morning is the very beginning of the
[38:33] creation of God in Frankfurt Burnham
[38:35] uses that scripture and he says it's not
[38:37] so much it's the beginning as in the
[38:39] beginning but it's a very beginner where
[38:42] it started it started in him he's the
[38:46] very originator it came out of him all
[38:49] of this in other word God didn't come
[38:52] and dwell into the world the world came
[38:54] out of God it wasn't that God came and
[38:57] he looked the world and he began to fix
[38:59] it no he created a pice word he spoke it
[39:02] into existence and and it's nothing that
[39:05] goes past him so I realized it's very
[39:08] important we're going to realize that
[39:10] nothing of men is permanent only the
[39:13] Word of God will stain the scripture
[39:15] tells us that heaven and earth will pass
[39:17] away but my words shall never pass away
[39:19] and we can certainly stand here the to
[39:22] life and say that this scripture is
[39:24] fulfilled because now here's everything
[39:27] that man has ever worked on passing away
[39:29] it's also amazing how you realize this
[39:33] economy the great economy that men build
[39:35] it almost runs in cycle every 10 years
[39:39] or so it comes to a cross and and people
[39:42] have to be rebuilt intent and change
[39:44] parts and do all kinds of things so they
[39:46] can run it again and and the next 10
[39:48] years the crashes again and it seems
[39:50] everything that mint does seems to just
[39:53] never amount to anything because it
[39:55] comes to a very old so realize the
[40:00] Scriptures fixing in Ecclesiastes I'll
[40:02] just jump so we can get to where we're
[40:05] trying to go quickly it's fixing I'll
[40:08] just jump and read 1 and 9 it says the
[40:11] thing that had been it is that which
[40:14] shall be which which shall be and that's
[40:18] which is done is which shall be done
[40:21] there is no new things Under the Sun
[40:25] there's nothing new the epitomy
[40:29] epidemics and all of those things they
[40:31] sub salutely nothing new this has been
[40:33] and it's been before and infinitely the
[40:36] Lord tarries we go again for many more
[40:38] years there's gonna be another one show
[40:40] up why because it's the ways of man
[40:43] under the Sun under the Sun there's
[40:45] nothing permanent Under the Sun nothing
[40:49] is meant to be lasting Under the Sun
[40:51] everything is built to be temporary and
[40:53] infertility says I have seen all the
[40:56] works that I've had done under the Sun
[40:58] and behold all is vanity vexing of the
[41:03] Spirit
[41:03] that's all it is all it is is just a
[41:07] tormenting and and you you you you work
[41:09] happing all right you know just sitting
[41:12] at home and thinking how that often time
[41:14] yet we are people are disturbed and we
[41:17] are tempted by the fashion and the music
[41:19] and all kinds of things of the world and
[41:21] in times like this you realize how
[41:23] quickly all of those things perished you
[41:26] realize how none of those things matter
[41:28] at home you realize how the whole world
[41:31] is cramming down and and the things that
[41:34] become very important it's the very life
[41:36] of a person you come to a place where
[41:38] you begin to realize all that we built
[41:41] and all that we do it's absolutely
[41:43] nothing
[41:45] so as we spoke and I said you know God's
[41:49] provision in the time of crisis when we
[41:52] define crisis I began to think in this
[41:56] couple of definition I just stumble
[41:58] across and he just really spoke to my
[42:01] heart it's a time of an intense
[42:03] difficulty trouble or danger it says
[42:07] it's a turning point of a disease of a
[42:09] disease when an important important
[42:13] change takes place indicating either
[42:16] recovery or death it says what so
[42:20] basically it's a time when what the
[42:23] systems of man everything that man
[42:26] possesses after everything that they
[42:28] have doesn't work then you get into the
[42:31] time of crisis you know I was thinking
[42:33] even you know as
[42:36] perhaps at your trouble whatever you do
[42:38] you know there's protocols and there's
[42:42] things when the system is not
[42:43] functioning the way it's supposed to you
[42:46] know that this is the protocol that we
[42:47] follow and we'll go in and we'll do this
[42:50] and we'll type this and we'll type this
[42:52] and this by the time we get to this the
[42:54] system will have recovered now I'm
[42:56] speaking about at times now that men
[42:58] have tried all of the things that they
[43:00] have in the system and it's not working
[43:02] now that calls for crisis that goes for
[43:05] crisis when what you know well if we do
[43:08] this your work what you're doing doesn't
[43:10] work it's a crisis it shows that what I
[43:12] have it doesn't answer to the needs that
[43:15] I have in front of me
[43:16] what Lynne has doesn't answer to the
[43:19] needs that they have in front of them
[43:20] what men has they have applied and it
[43:23] looks like it's not working and I tell
[43:25] you that's why we're so happy to be as
[43:27] the children of God tonight and I can
[43:29] say it's time for us to call upon what
[43:32] we know will work why because God has
[43:35] given us the answer to all the devil's
[43:37] question in fact the Bible says the
[43:39] problem tells us in this endtime that
[43:42] the Word of God the revealed Word of God
[43:45] it says he will answer to the needs of
[43:47] the aged whatever they need is that what
[43:50] of God will answer to those things and I
[43:54] just want to say this this is a call for
[43:56] us to just be on alert because we don't
[43:59] understand what's happening and it's not
[44:02] a time for just to sit around and and
[44:04] try to just uh you know tally the
[44:07] numbers or try to figure out what
[44:09] they're gonna do next another time I
[44:10] believe that God has another lien of
[44:12] people that was that he wants to see
[44:15] come on the scene and begin to work this
[44:17] thing when malice fell they did because
[44:20] what the scripture tells us that the end
[44:22] of the the wisdom of man is the very
[44:25] beginning of the wisdom of God where man
[44:27] has come to an end it's time for God to
[44:30] come on the scene so I began to think
[44:33] about the crisis in the Garden of Eden
[44:36] God created his kingdom and he created
[44:40] his son to have dominion he began to
[44:42] create hear me even in the very own
[44:45] image that is
[44:46] and could do the very thing that God was
[44:48] doing and he came his son was coming and
[44:51] moving trees and moving mountain in and
[44:54] calling giving things name everything
[44:56] was perfect and then one day sin came in
[44:59] something that was not supposed to be
[45:01] there Krypton and then that same son who
[45:04] was able to move the mountain and move
[45:06] the trees he came he spoke the word and
[45:08] nothing changed in fact in other words
[45:12] what he had didn't work anymore in other
[45:15] words what he tried he could try to
[45:17] apply it didn't work anymore it was a
[45:20] time for crisis and it's good to tells
[45:23] us that God came down in time of crisis
[45:26] he didn't just let his son are all in
[45:29] the garden and just try to figure out
[45:30] its own way no he came on the scene for
[45:33] him the scripture tells us that God came
[45:37] on the Sun on the scene in other words
[45:39] Adam was here now he realized that he in
[45:43] fact the scripture tells us it was roots
[45:45] running away yeah yes leading a crisis
[45:49] manager and God shows on the scene and
[45:51] where there was sin God took the scene
[45:54] and he gave righteousness where there
[45:56] was death he took the death and he gave
[45:58] life and he came why because he's the
[46:01] Christ crisis manager that we know her
[46:03] and that's who we need to call on the
[46:06] sin and crisis manager one who just know
[46:09] how to work everything as I pastor said
[46:12] this morning one who can look at a
[46:13] carburetor and tell you I want you to
[46:15] push this button I want you to move this
[46:18] over here
[46:18] I want to remove why because he's the
[46:20] very designer of that so he says but
[46:25] about him speaks if you could just hear
[46:28] this in the message we would see Jesus
[46:30] he says so then if her crisis would
[46:33] arise at any time and God call and God
[46:36] was called upon the scene to act in
[46:39] other word now it's telling us that when
[46:42] crisis comes it's time to call God on
[46:45] the scene it's not time to just sit back
[46:48] and relax and wonder what's going to
[46:50] happen and I'll read a statement here
[46:52] perhaps after this show we could get
[46:54] there it says then
[46:56] said then God was calling the sin to act
[46:58] it says then the way that he would act
[47:01] the way that he acted that time he will
[47:05] have to act each time that way in order
[47:08] to be God
[47:09] because if God doesn't act a second time
[47:13] the way he did the first he says he
[47:16] knows more about the time he knows more
[47:19] about this
[47:20] then he does then he did wrong when he
[47:23] acted the first time he has he says he
[47:26] would have to act the same each time he
[47:31] says if the world is in need of a savior
[47:34] and I say this the world is in need of a
[47:37] savior the world that we living in is in
[47:39] need of a savior now when I just
[47:41] professed this with this we understand
[47:43] the messenger told us that United States
[47:45] and all the countries that they rejected
[47:48] this message and then judgment was
[47:50] pronounced upon them and we can even
[47:53] look at the type in Israel when Christ
[47:55] was there they came and they rejected
[47:57] him in fact they even looked at him and
[47:59] they say let us dead let your blood be
[48:02] upon us and our children and we realize
[48:04] that when Titus came she was fulfilled
[48:07] about everything that they called upon
[48:09] themselves so we can certainly look and
[48:11] see the type and everything but we
[48:13] realize that even the Prophet tells us
[48:15] that what God hates is the systems it's
[48:18] what man has put together but we realize
[48:21] in that system there are children of God
[48:23] that are stuck in there and events like
[48:26] this is for God to bring awareness
[48:29] because this is a wake-up call this is a
[48:31] time where God is calling upon his
[48:34] children is doing something that man
[48:36] doesn't understand what's happening he's
[48:38] sending something that they have
[48:40] completely clueless on what to deal with
[48:42] and in that time his children they have
[48:46] no way to go but to go back to him why
[48:50] because God uses events in order to
[48:53] attract these children like we heard in
[48:55] my Sunday what is the attraction and
[48:58] some hearing and there all kinds of
[49:00] crying and calling rosado signer so look
[49:03] at it and he says let these people shut
[49:06] up what are they
[49:07] but others recognized that he was
[49:09] fulfillment of prophecy well I trust
[49:13] that we can tonight realize that this is
[49:16] the fulfillment of prophecy God is
[49:18] coming and calling upon these children
[49:20] in order to attract their attention
[49:22] he says if sickness arose in the camp he
[49:30] says and God made an atonement for
[49:32] healing I'm sorry I skipped something I
[49:35] was reading it says the world is in need
[49:38] of Savior then if he presents us if we
[49:42] presented a savior before if he
[49:44] presented a savior sorry a way of a way
[49:48] of salvation in the Garden of Eden - a
[49:52] way of escape he has to continue to do
[49:56] that in order to be God in other words
[50:00] we couldn't call upon God today and he
[50:02] says I'm not gonna answer in other words
[50:05] we couldn't come to a need that we call
[50:08] upon God and he says he says I will do
[50:10] differently why because if it's God he's
[50:13] going to do exactly as he did all the
[50:16] other times that's a comfort to us so we
[50:20] can know that his word is true his word
[50:22] his promise is true its word I ain't -
[50:26] we heard this morning what he said he
[50:28] will do is what he's gonna do it doesn't
[50:30] matter what time and it doesn't matter
[50:32] if it was done in the beginning he
[50:34] didn't matter if he done in the middle
[50:36] if anybody shows up and call upon the
[50:39] same God God will answer according to
[50:41] his word Oh hallelujah
[50:45] so we realized that we are in the time
[50:47] of crisis he continues on it says this
[50:51] in the message looking unto Jesus he
[50:53] says you look the best armor that
[50:57] America has in the present crisis is
[51:01] god-fearing praying people it's not the
[51:05] atomic bomb it's not all that's
[51:08] happening out there
[51:09] it's not even what man is trying to
[51:11] build up is saying that you know the
[51:13] best armor that America has in this
[51:15] present crisis is god-fearing praying
[51:18] people that's the best
[51:20] it's worth more than all the bombs and
[51:23] the tanks that you could produce God
[51:25] will always fight for his people and
[51:28] when his people call upon his name God
[51:31] will come upon the same God is not
[51:34] abandoned that's how we can sit here and
[51:36] wonder is he gonna do or he said I'm
[51:38] gonna do it
[51:39] what's gonna happen oh yes that doctor
[51:41] really worked hard for him to find the
[51:43] cure or what is the nurse do what are
[51:46] the scientists doing in fact there's a
[51:48] lot of quartz step I've seen in brothers
[51:50] have sent around where he said that
[51:52] those medical and all those scientists
[51:55] that will know nothing about it he said
[51:57] that he talked about people disinfecting
[52:00] and doing all kinds of things and he
[52:01] says that the doctors will know nothing
[52:03] about it but here he is saying that but
[52:06] God's fearing people are the best armor
[52:09] that United States or that America can
[52:11] ever have if the whole nation with all
[52:15] one Accord would throw themselves to God
[52:18] in sackcloth and ashes and repent and
[52:21] come back to the old fashioned pathway
[52:24] that our forefather trod that it says
[52:28] they couldn't be a bit of phenom and her
[52:32] arm that could come to us in other words
[52:35] will harm us and I'll say this this
[52:38] prophecy this word of God is true
[52:40] tonight and because remember but on
[52:45] excessive rejected the fact is God
[52:48] didn't reject his word God God send this
[52:51] world and those that have rejected are
[52:54] the one that are ripping judgment but if
[52:56] there's anybody in the system right now
[52:58] that will take that at his word and what
[53:01] he has spoken here and will believe that
[53:03] word God will come upon me same for him
[53:07] yeah it's a system that has been
[53:10] designed to reject the Word of God but
[53:12] it's not the people but you look at the
[53:15] casualty that's why I said as believers
[53:17] we want to make sure that we are not
[53:19] shining like that witness that we heard
[53:21] about this morning that we are calling
[53:23] upon our Father it's the time of crisis
[53:26] because he has designed the crisis so
[53:29] the crisis can bring us close to him
[53:33] he says he says he says and I believe
[53:41] and I believe it will be worth more than
[53:45] all the ammunition plants and things
[53:47] that we could make that's right it says
[53:51] in all the pumps that we would have
[53:53] there's nothing as great as prayer God
[53:57] holds all future in his hands Oh future
[54:04] when we can understand it or not
[54:06] understand whether we know how to place
[54:09] it or don't know how to place it
[54:11] why don't we can explain it or don't
[54:12] explain it our future is in his hand
[54:15] that's all comes for tonight we are not
[54:18] left to just like that by Allah's help
[54:20] we have been given the greatest weapon
[54:22] that there is on the face of the earth
[54:24] God taking it and giving it in the
[54:26] believers hand so that when they call
[54:28] upon God by prayer on their knees that
[54:31] God will hear he says he says that
[54:37] someone asks me not long ago says but a
[54:40] Brenham do you think do you think about
[54:43] the future I said I do not know what the
[54:47] future holds but I know who holds the
[54:50] future that's the thing if you can if
[54:53] you can if I can keep acquaintance with
[54:58] him that's the thing that's what we want
[55:02] that's why we want to keep the
[55:04] connection we want to make connection
[55:07] back to home we want to make that
[55:09] connection and call upon God to come and
[55:12] assist us er I was reading how you know
[55:14] that you know there was I don't know how
[55:18] many hundreds of police officers
[55:20] they've been contaminated and just
[55:22] trying to do their job to separate
[55:24] people and to keep them in their homes
[55:26] and all of that and they got infected by
[55:28] the by the virus just by trying to do
[55:30] their job you think about all the nurses
[55:33] that have caught up in the firefight and
[55:34] doing all that they can and I believe
[55:36] it's time that we do all that we can as
[55:39] children of God
[55:40] so we can assess so that God can come on
[55:43] the scene so I realized it and I begin
[55:46] to think about this this is the time
[55:48] where the scripture says it's adoption
[55:50] time an adoption consists of one that
[55:54] has to be placed into a place and it's a
[55:57] timer that is God is calling upon the
[56:00] sons and daughters to come to a place
[56:02] where they can assume authority and
[56:05] that's why I said when we don't know we
[56:07] go to God when we know we go to God it's
[56:10] in every time they didn't say that just
[56:13] come to me when you understand what's
[56:14] going on he didn't say just come to me
[56:17] when you actually know what you asking
[56:20] for whether we know what we asking for
[56:22] we don't know we still go to him so he
[56:28] continues on he says wait he speaks on
[56:34] he says and why that's God led trouble
[56:39] come he says that God harnesses trouble
[56:45] and put bits in his mouth and makes it
[56:49] obey hell and those troubles they bring
[56:52] us close to a closer fellowship with him
[56:56] that's the purpose for all of this God
[57:00] is needing fellowship he's wanting to
[57:02] shake this world once again and if there
[57:05] be any child any son or any daughter
[57:08] somewhere perhaps a backslide perhaps
[57:10] the eyes that are here tonight and
[57:12] perhaps you that are listening and we
[57:14] could be caught in some things where
[57:17] there's no fool connections back home
[57:19] and you know we have this electronic
[57:22] device in this machines and everything
[57:25] especially all of the lessons the latest
[57:27] one that they're designing they have
[57:29] what they call a call home button in
[57:32] other words that button is yours when
[57:34] that system somehow gets in trouble when
[57:37] that system wherever it is it has to be
[57:40] able to call home if the system somehow
[57:43] cannot call home something is happening
[57:45] somebody's going to call you and tell
[57:47] you there's something wrong with the
[57:49] system
[57:49] it's designed that way with your call
[57:52] home
[57:52] and I believe accretion is designed the
[57:55] same way we have a called home button in
[57:57] order to be connected with God and when
[58:00] things are not working with press the
[58:01] call home button when something is wrong
[58:04] we place to call home button so now I
[58:08] want you now to realize here what
[58:10] brother Branham is saying now I want you
[58:12] to think about the crisis in Eden and
[58:14] all those things no this was a crisis to
[58:17] Adam this was in other word yes what he
[58:22] knew the things that it would say and
[58:24] this and she things happen now he's
[58:27] saying them and nothing is happening but
[58:30] under no means that was a crisis to God
[58:33] in other words what was the crisis to
[58:36] Adam was an opportunity for God to step
[58:39] in what was something that seemed
[58:42] complicated for Adam to not know which
[58:44] way should go or why he should do in
[58:47] fact he ran away and head on his fig
[58:50] leaf could not produce or help him to
[58:53] wipe away they say no was committed but
[58:56] all of that was it was an opportunity
[58:58] for God to step in for fellowship all of
[59:02] this is is an opportunity for us to get
[59:05] in greater fellowship with God all of
[59:07] this is is another place is another
[59:10] design from God so he can come down
[59:13] because he's the master system he
[59:16] created the whole system and nothing
[59:18] escapes him so the Prophet says it says
[59:22] then he says they had no Rimbaud until
[59:28] the flood came speaking about the
[59:32] contrast their appearances spoken but
[59:35] after Noah was pressed into that
[59:39] condition he was in to flood 40 days and
[59:43] 40 nights into the stone and then little
[59:46] Ark pitched up down in the water it was
[59:51] there it was after the flood was over
[59:55] that he saw the rainbow
[59:59] you know we would learn we wouldn't
[1:00:02] appreciate the rainbow if we saw the
[1:00:03] rainbow every day we were in appreciate
[1:00:07] the health as our passive smoke unless
[1:00:09] we got sick and then we learn to
[1:00:11] appreciate help we will live
[1:00:14] appreciative in the gathering of
[1:00:16] ourselves until something like this
[1:00:17] happened our selling my wife at home I
[1:00:20] said oh I'll tell you the Sunday that we
[1:00:22] all meet together the building is going
[1:00:24] to come down why because they will learn
[1:00:26] to appreciate well then to say Oh God
[1:00:29] God is a great God and perhaps it'll
[1:00:31] give us a sense of what is happening and
[1:00:34] what God is trying to do when he gets us
[1:00:36] together it will it will it would take
[1:00:40] something different such a contrast
[1:00:42] something to break it apart so that when
[1:00:45] you put it back together you realize
[1:00:46] what beauty lies into it
[1:00:50] often time we can't he just becomes like
[1:00:52] you know I gotta go to church again and
[1:00:55] you go and say you come back Sunday and
[1:00:57] people are coming you know they want a
[1:01:00] certain place to see it and they won't
[1:01:01] dare send this happening and the
[1:01:03] temperatures not just right and all
[1:01:05] those things I'll tell you this brings a
[1:01:07] brand new appreciation for all those
[1:01:09] things why because God is bringing the
[1:01:13] contrast I tell you people say that man
[1:01:16] created this earth this happening this
[1:01:18] happen this cannot happen unless God
[1:01:21] allows it as a children of God we don't
[1:01:24] attribute any success or any power to
[1:01:27] the devil well we know these everything
[1:01:29] that happens God's allowed and I believe
[1:01:36] we're gonna gather again I believe it
[1:01:38] will happen I believe this is not the
[1:01:40] end because according to the promise we
[1:01:42] see that it's there we live in the time
[1:01:45] of the perfection of perfecting of
[1:01:47] ourselves we have received the word and
[1:01:50] the word is here to pick out all the
[1:01:51] greens to remove all the worldliness had
[1:01:54] of us and to bring us in the rupture
[1:01:56] condition so we can go out of here and I
[1:01:58] believe just just reinforce those things
[1:02:01] so when we come back we are come with
[1:02:03] the zeal to know that I'm coming to the
[1:02:05] Word of God I'm coming to the house of
[1:02:07] God
[1:02:08] worship Him Peter speaks and he says
[1:02:15] wherein ye greatly rejoice through it it
[1:02:19] says though now for a season if you if
[1:02:23] need be you are help you have you are in
[1:02:28] heaviness through manifold temptation so
[1:02:31] now even our rejoicing the scripture
[1:02:33] doesn't say we're just forever on earth
[1:02:36] it says our rejoicing is only for a
[1:02:38] season we are just going to be
[1:02:41] happy-go-lucky every day just think
[1:02:43] seems to just go on and everything in
[1:02:46] fact is promising that they will come
[1:02:48] time when things going away that we
[1:02:50] don't worry to come
[1:02:52] it says too heavy he says that the trial
[1:02:56] of your faith being much more precious
[1:02:58] than gold that perishes though through a
[1:03:02] trial adobe try be tried by fire must be
[1:03:05] found unto the praises and honor and
[1:03:07] glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] in other words where the trial comes
[1:03:11] whether temptation comes whatever comes
[1:03:14] my way I want to be found in a place
[1:03:17] where I'm worshipping Jesus Christ it
[1:03:20] says whom having not sinned ye love ye
[1:03:23] love in whom though ye now de now he
[1:03:28] seen him not yet believed and he rejoice
[1:03:31] with joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:03:35] receiving the end of your faith even the
[1:03:38] salvation of your soul of which
[1:03:40] salvation the prophet have inquired and
[1:03:43] searched diligently will prophesy of the
[1:03:47] grace that should come unto you
[1:03:49] searching searching what or what or what
[1:03:53] manner of time the Spirit of God which
[1:03:56] was in them did signify when he
[1:04:00] testified beforehand the suffering of
[1:04:02] Christ and the glory that should follow
[1:04:04] so in other word it's it's all of these
[1:04:07] things the suffering and the things that
[1:04:10] are happening they are spoken to comment
[1:04:13] it says that before that's why we we
[1:04:16] love we look not on things that are down
[1:04:19] but we look on things that are above
[1:04:20] that's why we
[1:04:22] focus on the temporal thing we focus on
[1:04:24] the permanent things so having spoken on
[1:04:27] those things so now we find out that
[1:04:31] Abraham Gary was oh what a time of
[1:04:37] crisis here is that being asked to offer
[1:04:40] His only Son
[1:04:42] they're very testimony that God had
[1:04:45] given him something that is stood and
[1:04:48] above even up after 25 years he's stood
[1:04:52] there in the time of crisis but I want
[1:04:55] you to just realize for a moment what
[1:04:57] came out of every ham as a result of
[1:04:59] this crisis ever ahem testify that it
[1:05:02] was going to have a son that God was
[1:05:04] gonna give him a son and yeah yes after
[1:05:07] after 25 years he came and he receive a
[1:05:11] son from God but here he is God comes
[1:05:14] back and he says that I want you to
[1:05:15] offer me this son your only Son he calls
[1:05:18] him it says your only one son that I
[1:05:21] want that's the one I want her him loved
[1:05:24] him by obedience of the word of God ever
[1:05:27] ahem took the son and he began to go he
[1:05:31] took two servants with him he began to
[1:05:34] walk and I began to think perhaps if you
[1:05:37] asked Abraham do you know actually
[1:05:40] what's gonna happen when you get there
[1:05:42] he probably would've answered you I
[1:05:44] don't know I don't know
[1:05:47] oftentimes we we think if something is
[1:05:52] wrong when we don't know no God
[1:05:54] sometimes lives us instead like that
[1:05:56] where we don't understand and we don't
[1:05:58] know if we don't know it's okay just
[1:06:01] give it into his hand that's why I said
[1:06:04] when you know you give when you don't
[1:06:05] know you can so here he is walking and
[1:06:08] he gets to a place and he perhaps he
[1:06:11] realized what's about to happen and he
[1:06:13] didn't want any hindrance he didn't want
[1:06:15] anybody holding him perhaps had he taken
[1:06:18] this to service that we're gonna hold
[1:06:19] him from not doing it so he takes them
[1:06:22] and he says that I want you to wait here
[1:06:24] that I'm going further in other word
[1:06:26] when time came to a place where was
[1:06:29] became hard ever ham took another step
[1:06:31] by himself
[1:06:32] continue
[1:06:34] God ever ahem took a step in there in
[1:06:37] the way to obedience to what God told
[1:06:39] him to do so he came in and after they
[1:06:43] left just the two of them
[1:06:45] Isaac asked him he says father he says I
[1:06:49] see the fire I see the word but where's
[1:06:52] the offer he I don't believe that word
[1:06:55] was conquered or put together by Abraham
[1:06:58] himself this is God speaking out of
[1:07:01] Abraham because it's going to do the
[1:07:03] same thing he says that God will provide
[1:07:06] for himself a sacrifice I tell you my
[1:07:10] brother my sister we don't need to offer
[1:07:12] god sacrifices that he doesn't need what
[1:07:16] we need is to did God sacrifice that he
[1:07:18] has already offered for us in other
[1:07:21] words he's giving us away God is the one
[1:07:24] who gives a way of escape God is the one
[1:07:26] who provides away the lamb that was
[1:07:28] found in the thicket was there made by
[1:07:31] God it was not a man that put him there
[1:07:33] let's not put our man man's
[1:07:35] interpretation or I'll come up with
[1:07:37] their own plan on how we're gonna
[1:07:39] protect ourselves so how we need to
[1:07:41] barricade ourselves and blue toilet
[1:07:43] paper in this room and put food on
[1:07:45] another room and do all of that no let
[1:07:48] God be a provider people are acting
[1:07:53] despite of other people that today
[1:07:56] acting in a manner that that that they
[1:07:59] don't care about anybody anymore they're
[1:08:03] doing things for their protective skin
[1:08:06] they're doing things so they can
[1:08:08] preserve themselves you know I went to
[1:08:10] you know I send mass in a picture you
[1:08:14] know I went to I thought I thought I
[1:08:15] thought this was gonna pass and squig I
[1:08:17] thought you know I'll come back tomorrow
[1:08:19] I'll be able to get some toilet paper I
[1:08:21] went to Target we went to Walmart
[1:08:24] there was Allison I mean there was
[1:08:26] nothing and then I thought well we'll
[1:08:28] show up the next day next day the same
[1:08:30] thing I stood in line same thing
[1:08:33] I came to the realization man is trying
[1:08:36] to make provision for himself and I
[1:08:38] realized I told my wife I said if we go
[1:08:41] back to that store and bought every
[1:08:43] food that there is in there we're gonna
[1:08:46] run out still we're still gonna run out
[1:08:52] if it's absolutely impossible to buy in
[1:08:57] a manner that you will never need to go
[1:08:59] back and buy again
[1:09:02] so what behavior what is causing people
[1:09:05] to act this way fear self-preservation
[1:09:10] things that they they try to protect
[1:09:12] themselves in the children and they
[1:09:14] trying to look put themselves first and
[1:09:16] all those things but we realized that as
[1:09:18] children of God God has given us a
[1:09:20] provision in him and I'll tell you this
[1:09:23] we speak about the rumen of Celexa
[1:09:25] reptile how that she was about to make
[1:09:27] the last case and the Prophet told him
[1:09:29] to give it to him and he says that if
[1:09:31] you give it to him God will multiply it
[1:09:33] I'll say that in this time if God is to
[1:09:36] do that it will happen it will happen
[1:09:42] why because as we read in the time of
[1:09:45] crisis if God does differently from the
[1:09:49] way he's done a thousand thousands of
[1:09:51] years before then is not God a
[1:09:55] confidence into the fact that the way he
[1:09:57] did with the remai woman of Sara Tom the
[1:10:00] way he did in the years past he's gonna
[1:10:02] do the same with us tonight if he does
[1:10:06] any differently then it's not the same
[1:10:08] God I would just want to say this in
[1:10:16] closing we're just gonna get to this and
[1:10:18] then we'll close I was reading I thought
[1:10:21] this was a a very interesting story and
[1:10:25] you know it very well I'm not going to
[1:10:28] go through all of this one I'll just
[1:10:30] give the highlights so we could get to
[1:10:32] the end in second Kings chapter 3 we're
[1:10:35] just going to read 16 to 18 it says this
[1:10:38] is the scripture about that's the the
[1:10:41] story about the valley of ditches it
[1:10:44] says that in the sense that cells alone
[1:10:47] make a valley full of ditches for thus
[1:10:52] saith the Lord
[1:10:53] ye shall not see wind no shall I see
[1:10:57] rain yet the Valley shall be filled with
[1:11:01] water now I want you to understand what
[1:11:04] the Prophet is saying here something
[1:11:06] impossible he's specifically telling
[1:11:09] them you shall not see wind you shall
[1:11:11] not see rain but yet the the wells will
[1:11:15] be filled with water and says it shall
[1:11:18] be shall he shall see the Valley shall
[1:11:21] be filled with water but ye that ye may
[1:11:24] drink both he and your cattle and your
[1:11:27] your beasts your beasts and all this is
[1:11:31] on all this is but the light the light
[1:11:34] thing in the sight of the Lord you will
[1:11:37] you will he will deliver the Moabites
[1:11:41] also into your hands so if we can back
[1:11:45] up just a little bit it's a very
[1:11:47] interesting story because you come to
[1:11:49] realize yeah there are there was three
[1:11:51] kings Israel was broken up into pieces
[1:11:55] there was the king of Israel the king of
[1:11:57] Judah and the king of Edom they had came
[1:12:00] up the king of of we realized that
[1:12:04] ability I believe his name is Jehovah
[1:12:07] he was being the son of Ahab and Jezebel
[1:12:12] he was king and now he did things that
[1:12:15] are not good in the sight of the Lord
[1:12:17] and everything and we realized that
[1:12:18] after after a half pass away that the
[1:12:21] king of more abide the things that had
[1:12:23] place to do he didn't do anymore
[1:12:26] also they were getting ready to go to
[1:12:28] war so now the king I came and he gather
[1:12:32] up with he got together with your hos
[1:12:35] effect and they went and they got the
[1:12:36] king of Edom together so they can go to
[1:12:39] fight with the king of Moab so they came
[1:12:42] together and they took their army no
[1:12:44] doubt the army was strong and and and
[1:12:47] and and well-trained and the horses and
[1:12:49] whatever they were using at the time and
[1:12:51] everything so they can go to war so now
[1:12:54] they begin to walk and they find
[1:12:56] themselves in the valley one of the
[1:12:59] thing that Dunn's on them real quickly
[1:13:01] is that they don't have any water
[1:13:05] now I want you to think and I want you
[1:13:07] to equate it with what's happening today
[1:13:09] then here's the great army this is now
[1:13:12] they knew with no doubt that if you were
[1:13:15] to take those armies and match them
[1:13:18] against the army of the more pipe that
[1:13:20] they would win the war they had no doubt
[1:13:22] about it but one thing that they didn't
[1:13:24] think about it was water somehow in the
[1:13:28] system something seemed to be missing
[1:13:31] some somehow in the economy this great
[1:13:34] economy that they have built something
[1:13:37] seems to be missing and then they came
[1:13:39] to a place now they need something now I
[1:13:43] want you to realize how that domains
[1:13:45] begin to work now of course to hold them
[1:13:49] being an unbeliever began to think Oh
[1:13:53] perhaps this was all the plan all along
[1:13:56] he said well perhaps God want us to come
[1:13:59] here so the Moabites can come and kill
[1:14:01] us all so now we don't have water we
[1:14:04] don't have protection so now now that's
[1:14:06] the thinking of the unbelievers they
[1:14:09] begin to think well perhaps this is how
[1:14:11] the world is going to end perhaps this
[1:14:14] is the end of it all you know we thought
[1:14:16] the end was going to come this way or
[1:14:18] that way perhaps this is how we die now
[1:14:22] this is a great army that was built for
[1:14:24] war and this is the testimony then the
[1:14:28] scripture tells us now Jehoshaphat now
[1:14:31] I'll say this in their condition no
[1:14:35] doubt we know as we read the history
[1:14:37] that that bale that they had profits of
[1:14:40] bales we understand those things and and
[1:14:42] even some had sue sales people I could
[1:14:45] see and things like that and you realize
[1:14:47] that in the condition that their way in
[1:14:50] their soothsayers could not help them
[1:14:52] their scientists could not help them all
[1:14:55] the people could not help them
[1:14:57] no soothsayer could make water come from
[1:15:01] someplace no god of Bell was able to
[1:15:05] come and help them in this situation now
[1:15:08] I want you now to turn aside and think
[1:15:11] about their thinking of a believer
[1:15:13] Jehoshaphat stood and and here he is
[1:15:16] finding himself
[1:15:17] in the same predicament he looks and
[1:15:20] what comes to his mind is is there no
[1:15:23] profit that we can consult oh I'll tell
[1:15:27] you a sense of God daughters of God I
[1:15:30] tell you when we find ourselves in the
[1:15:32] fix there's only one place we can go and
[1:15:35] that's to consult the messenger what is
[1:15:38] God says about this what is the word
[1:15:40] said about this now this could be God
[1:15:42] doing what he wants to do but I just
[1:15:45] want to talk to him so you can let me
[1:15:47] tell whatever God's will is for whatever
[1:15:49] is happening my confidence is I want to
[1:15:52] talk to God and have him speak to me and
[1:15:54] put the peace within my heart the FPV is
[1:15:58] worried about where am I going to get
[1:16:00] the next roll of toilet paper is this
[1:16:03] how we're gonna die what's gonna be next
[1:16:05] how are we gonna shoot ourselves and do
[1:16:07] all kinds of things but yet the believer
[1:16:10] is wanting to know what is the word says
[1:16:13] what time I was specifically living in
[1:16:16] well how can I just go on knees on my
[1:16:19] knees in prayer because these are
[1:16:21] serious times this is not a job this is
[1:16:24] a serious time so listen to what brother
[1:16:28] Branham says he speaks about this he
[1:16:32] says he says he says in the message the
[1:16:44] prophet Elijah he says then we see that
[1:16:49] when the crisis is showed up just he
[1:16:54] says the crisis just came and he showed
[1:16:56] up who was who who was down in the heart
[1:17:01] in other words crisis revealed their
[1:17:03] character was it he says was yet a
[1:17:08] believer he says that was Jehoshaphat
[1:17:11] he said well here we have here we are
[1:17:16] with no water and the other king says I
[1:17:19] guess the more Biden sought us out here
[1:17:22] and now they're going to slay us all out
[1:17:26] here but you're hos affector believer
[1:17:29] now out kind of company I says he'd kind
[1:17:33] of come to himself and he says isn't
[1:17:36] there a prophet somewhere that we could
[1:17:39] consult that could consult the Lord it
[1:17:42] says that's pretty good idea don't don't
[1:17:46] you think so he says that could consult
[1:17:48] the Lord about this matter it says if
[1:17:51] you are injured in jeopardy here it says
[1:17:55] we're going to die or be defeated
[1:17:57] shouldn't we consult the Lord he says
[1:18:00] well if a nation or an army should
[1:18:03] consult the Lord at the time of trouble
[1:18:06] what about a cancer what about a cancer
[1:18:10] has gone into a corner it's got you in
[1:18:12] the corner TB has got you on the corner
[1:18:15] what when infection when when affliction
[1:18:18] got you in the corner
[1:18:20] don't give up let's consult the Lord
[1:18:23] about it and see what it has to say
[1:18:26] that's what it believeth us we consult
[1:18:30] the Lord what is it have the same
[1:18:33] he continues on it says maybe he says
[1:18:36] I'm a drunkard I'm a harlot I'm a I'm
[1:18:40] cursed from all my life he says don't
[1:18:43] give up let's go set the load about it
[1:18:47] and see what he says about it don't give
[1:18:50] up hope I don't care what your condition
[1:18:52] is that's why I said it don't matter if
[1:18:55] it's the wall the most ranked sinner if
[1:18:59] he can consult the love tonight if he
[1:19:02] can come and ask the Lord what is it
[1:19:04] that's happening God will speak to him
[1:19:07] that is no respecter of person he's not
[1:19:10] your justice gonna speak to this enough
[1:19:12] if you come to his word he's gonna speak
[1:19:15] to you now I want to say this now I want
[1:19:17] you to realize now Jehoshaphat in the
[1:19:20] time of crisis you see that the crisis
[1:19:22] were made always to bring the children
[1:19:25] of God closer in fellowship with him you
[1:19:28] can look at it in Jehoshaphat it drew
[1:19:30] him close to him now when they came to
[1:19:34] Elijah he looks at him and I want you to
[1:19:37] kind of just picture this for a moment
[1:19:39] they all came three and they stood
[1:19:41] before him and he looked at him he
[1:19:44] looked at your elbow he says that if he
[1:19:46] had not been shallow Jehoshaphat he said
[1:19:49] I wouldn't even stand here and talk to
[1:19:51] you in other word if he had not been for
[1:19:56] the children of God on this earth God
[1:19:58] will not even care what's happening out
[1:20:00] there if it had not been for a believer
[1:20:05] somewhere God will turn its back because
[1:20:09] remember once we are lifted up from this
[1:20:11] earth there's nothing left because we
[1:20:15] are here God is giving us the power to
[1:20:17] change the circumstances that's what I'm
[1:20:21] thinking about tonight
[1:20:22] we can even look at ourselves as Hester
[1:20:24] and say each such a time like this I
[1:20:27] tell you there's nothing that rings true
[1:20:29] in the heart of the believer than to see
[1:20:31] God come on the scene he says if he was
[1:20:36] not what you're hos effect I would even
[1:20:38] look at you
[1:20:40] because it was Roth and we realized they
[1:20:44] called so they can play music to just
[1:20:46] come a little bit and I want to remind
[1:20:49] you now as our pastor said this morning
[1:20:51] and that's the music began to pray he
[1:20:54] began to enter into another spirit he
[1:20:57] began to enter into the vision and the
[1:21:00] vision began to manifest something and
[1:21:02] out of the vision out of the spirit they
[1:21:06] were able to draw the Word of God and he
[1:21:09] came and he gave them the word for that
[1:21:12] time and I believe with all my heart if
[1:21:15] we can enter into prayer enter into that
[1:21:18] spirit and let the spirit lead us God is
[1:21:22] going to speak to us about what he's
[1:21:24] gonna do in this hour God is going to
[1:21:26] show us it's going to comfort his
[1:21:27] children God is going to come on the
[1:21:29] scene and show us and speak to us the
[1:21:32] answer that we are looking for God has
[1:21:35] not left us alone so he says well
[1:21:39] brother Branham I'll try I tried for six
[1:21:43] years to be born again of the Spirit of
[1:21:47] God to receive the Holy Spirit I've
[1:21:50] never yet come to it never yet come to
[1:21:53] me he says well let's try again tonight
[1:21:56] I tell you no one should be in despair
[1:22:00] no one should feel left out God has not
[1:22:04] left to anybody I don't care if it's the
[1:22:07] ring that's why we are the light of the
[1:22:09] word I believe this is a perfect
[1:22:11] opportunity if somebody walked up to you
[1:22:13] and begin to talk about all of the
[1:22:15] confusion that's coming out and all this
[1:22:18] one says let's do this no one says that
[1:22:20] to this this is the time that you can
[1:22:22] bring them to the scripture says my
[1:22:24] friend they said there's a source here
[1:22:26] this sauce never changes when all the
[1:22:28] effects outside change this has never
[1:22:30] changed
[1:22:32] it says let's try again tonight see what
[1:22:36] the Lord says oh I want to hear what the
[1:22:39] Lord says I really want to hear what he
[1:22:42] says I really want to hear from the
[1:22:44] throne of God he says for is always
[1:22:46] willing if we just get everything out to
[1:22:50] his way I'll skip just so I could get to
[1:22:57] the end but when I'm says he speaks
[1:23:06] about Lazarus he says Martha and Mary
[1:23:12] after leaving the church and Lazarus
[1:23:16] they had believed on Jesus and Jesus
[1:23:19] walked away from them now order to think
[1:23:24] they left the church because of Jesus so
[1:23:27] they can support his ministry and
[1:23:29] Lazarus was known as Jesus body they
[1:23:33] went in fact I think I heard somewhere
[1:23:36] that even as you as it was walking when
[1:23:38] he went to be baptized by John Lazarus
[1:23:40] was there it says and they had believed
[1:23:48] on Jesus and Jesus walked away from them
[1:23:51] in the crisis he says when the body was
[1:23:55] sick then the body got sick and Jesus
[1:23:59] left that way that way her that was
[1:24:02] horrible and I'll I'll send I'll send
[1:24:06] for him he wouldn't come he went father
[1:24:10] and they sent for him again he still
[1:24:13] didn't come and I was still worse and
[1:24:16] then after all hope was gone then
[1:24:20] Lazarus died and they buried in the
[1:24:23] grave for four days and after decayed
[1:24:27] think about crisis
[1:24:32] think about crisis the person are you
[1:24:34] you prayed you did this you went here do
[1:24:37] what look for him send people go anyone
[1:24:39] far away you went and now the person is
[1:24:41] gone you probably was wishing before we
[1:24:44] could bury him just if I could see him
[1:24:46] it will do something and now you have
[1:24:48] him in the tomb earth 1st 2nd 3rd 4th
[1:24:53] after decaying it says and the darkest
[1:24:59] hour all hope all hopes gone and
[1:25:02] everything else then Jesus came along at
[1:25:06] that time he says heart trouble
[1:25:11] nothing hard for God he just healed all
[1:25:15] kinds of diseases he says God bless you
[1:25:19] you go on your Road rejoicing and be
[1:25:22] happy and you had some and if you had
[1:25:25] something just keep on moving God's made
[1:25:29] all well all of you well and you will
[1:25:33] make every person well in the building
[1:25:35] right now and I want to say even online
[1:25:37] if you will believe him if you believe
[1:25:41] him and stand on your feet for a minute
[1:25:44] God is our refuge in our strength the
[1:25:47] very present help in terms of need the
[1:25:50] crisis is on the battle is on raise up
[1:25:53] your hand and touch the lifeline now and
[1:25:56] move with him and Jesus in Jesus name
[1:26:00] and receive it he says here I hope I
[1:26:04] hope you see it it says the character of
[1:26:08] Pentecost and Baptists and Presbyterians
[1:26:11] Church our character should have should
[1:26:15] have us put into a place where we can
[1:26:19] when we can be found in the office to
[1:26:22] meet the crisis of this hour we are
[1:26:27] called the bread of Christ we have been
[1:26:31] put to meet the crisis of this hour the
[1:26:34] scripture tells us that we are the final
[1:26:36] voice to the final age we have nothing
[1:26:38] to fear we have been put here for such a
[1:26:41] time as there
[1:26:42] it says that we are in what a shame we
[1:26:46] are but he says but God but but but will
[1:26:50] God answer in any time of crisis he
[1:26:54] asked a question he will not it will not
[1:26:57] only answer but he will make manifest in
[1:27:00] the time of crisis if the people
[1:27:02] assemble themselves together no matter
[1:27:05] what no ma no matter if two or three
[1:27:08] whatever it is and pray there he said he
[1:27:12] will hear from heaven I want to say this
[1:27:16] just in closing let's use our weapons
[1:27:19] but what brother David said this morning
[1:27:22] that we cannot just look at the promises
[1:27:24] laying there and say that we have them
[1:27:28] what I'm saying is let's by way of
[1:27:33] prayer pull down upon those promises and
[1:27:37] have them become a reality for us
[1:27:40] Jehoshaphat because of Jehoshaphat
[1:27:44] Jeroboam and the king of Edom were saved
[1:27:47] yes because he said if it was not for
[1:27:51] Jehoshaphat he wouldn't have been talked
[1:27:53] to the others and I believe because of
[1:27:56] you and I because of the right God can
[1:28:00] come and talk and move again
[1:28:02] why because you are still here because
[1:28:04] this is not what was promised this came
[1:28:07] and he can give us an answer to it let's
[1:28:10] all stand
[1:28:26] Sbarro's our gracious father
[1:28:31] Lord what an hour
[1:28:41] but I heard that there was believers in
[1:28:45] Europe I heard that there was one in ICU
[1:28:47] and another was infected
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] let all the churches closed and
[1:28:53] everything and look we move by faith as
[1:28:59] our pastor told us we move in the time
[1:29:03] of great contrast we have a promise and
[1:29:06] we have a witness Lord we just want to
[1:29:11] lift up our voices in each one hiding in
[1:29:13] their closet and just calling upon the
[1:29:15] name of the Lord
[1:29:17] Georgia prophet tells us that it's
[1:29:20] prayer that takes those promises and
[1:29:22] makes them a reality when we call upon
[1:29:25] the name of the Lord he says we don't
[1:29:27] pray until those promises comes to be
[1:29:30] Lord we lift our hands tonight and say
[1:29:33] father that we are concerned about our
[1:29:37] fellow man we are concerned about those
[1:29:39] nurses and doctors and all those people
[1:29:41] that are deployed and blood if you if
[1:29:43] they would ask us to do something Lord
[1:29:45] not no doubt will jump to it to help our
[1:29:47] fellow man but we know that the true
[1:29:51] answer comes from you O God
[1:29:54] therefore we lift up on our hands and we
[1:29:56] say Lord this is our time of crisis why
[1:29:59] don't you just come on God as you came
[1:30:02] all the other times and help your people
[1:30:05] Lord we're so thankful to be called sons
[1:30:09] and daughters to you and Lord now we
[1:30:11] bring our sonship and I and all that
[1:30:14] you've called us Lord we laid upon the
[1:30:16] table look like Esther going in and said
[1:30:19] that I will go in for the sake of the
[1:30:21] people though that we may go into and
[1:30:24] for the sake of the people
[1:30:25] help us Lord and where we have fair load
[1:30:29] we want to be right this is a perfect
[1:30:31] thing time if we don't have the Holy
[1:30:33] Spirit Lord give it to us tonight
[1:30:35] whatever we have we lacking we've come
[1:30:38] tonight to receive from you Lord that we
[1:30:41] may be found
[1:30:43] in the fall we're so thankful Lord we
[1:30:46] commit everything we are to you and ask

[1:31:51] this time amen and the Lord Jesus said
[1:31:55] no man lighted the candle and put it
[1:31:57] under a bushel basket but he sets it up
[1:32:00] on the hill that it could give light who
[1:32:04] does it give light to those that need
[1:32:05] the light amen no I mean our spirits be

[1:32:15] when they have no faith may our
[1:32:17] testimony be to share with them there is
[1:32:20] a fountain I just thought that was
[1:32:22] wonderful tonight I think it surely
[1:32:26] points to us the reason that we need to
[1:32:30] seek out the Spirit of God in our life
[1:32:33] each one of us is believers at home
[1:32:35] those that are here to sit back and and
[1:32:39] find out what our part is to play what
[1:32:42] our attitude what our nature what words
[1:32:45] that we should have on our tongue and I
[1:32:48] thought it was such a beautiful thought
[1:32:49] that this would be fruitful amen that it
[1:32:53] would drive people to inquire is there
[1:32:57] hope in the land yes there's faith in
