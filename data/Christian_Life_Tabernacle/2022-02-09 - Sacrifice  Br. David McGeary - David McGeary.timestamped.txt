[33:59] there all the way to the end
[34:02] lord we're so grateful for that this
[34:04] evening
[34:05] may we dwell on that this evening we
[34:07] pray
[34:08] in your precious and holy name we pray
[34:12] amen
[34:13] amen god bless you tonight if you have
[34:16] your bibles
[34:17] let's turn to
[34:21] the gospel of saint john the 15th
[34:24] chapter
[34:25] and we'd like to
[34:28] read
[34:34] starting in the
[34:36] let's start in the 10th verse
[34:40] uh let's start in the ninth verse
[34:42] okay let's go to genesis 1 1 and start
[34:45] there
[34:47] amen so saint john 15 let's start with
[34:51] verse 9
[34:52] this evening
[34:54] you know i always like to read the verse
[34:56] ahead of it and
[34:58] make sure i'm in context and
[35:00] then that verse sounds so good i keep
[35:02] jumping up and
[35:03] and then pretty soon the whole bible
[35:05] sounds good amen
[35:07] amen
[35:09] john the 15th chapter the ninth verse as
[35:12] the father hath loved me
[35:15] so have
[35:17] i
[35:18] loved you
[35:20] continue ye in
[35:23] my love
[35:24] so
[35:25] isn't that amazing when you really think
[35:27] about it that god is love
[35:30] amen if you keep my commandments you
[35:34] shall abide in my love
[35:38] what a secret
[35:40] how can you abide in his love keep his
[35:42] commandments and you will abide in my
[35:45] love
[35:46] even as i have kept my father's
[35:50] commandments
[35:51] and abide in his love it's not asking us
[35:55] to do something that he didn't do
[35:58] so i want you to keep that thought there
[36:01] because this is a place that you can
[36:04] live
[36:05] and abide
[36:06] is in the love of god
[36:08] i believe that's the safest place there
[36:12] is
[36:12] is the love of god
[36:15] amen love thinketh no evil it does no
[36:17] evil it's a tremendous thing
[36:22] these
[36:23] things have i spoken unto you
[36:27] that my joy might remain
[36:31] in you
[36:33] and that your joy might be
[36:37] full
[36:39] think of that now these are some good
[36:40] scriptures we're gonna uh just have a
[36:43] little bit of fellowship with but
[36:46] that's what the scripture
[36:48] says here these things have i spoken so
[36:50] i've told you these things for a reason
[36:54] right he's just not
[36:56] throwing out statements i'm giving you
[36:58] secrets i'm telling you these things for
[37:01] a reason and the thing is i told you
[37:03] this is the result
[37:05] of them the things i have spoken unto
[37:08] you that ye might remain
[37:11] that
[37:12] my joy
[37:14] might remain in you
[37:17] and that your joy might be full
[37:21] this
[37:22] is my commandment
[37:24] that you love one another as
[37:27] i
[37:28] have
[37:29] loved
[37:30] you
[37:31] you know we all like to love somebody
[37:34] but to love somebody the way he loved
[37:36] you means to forgive him of everything
[37:40] you know what i mean to throw everything
[37:42] in the sea of god's forgetfulness as
[37:44] that's what he did to be what
[37:46] remembered no more
[37:48] you know you don't worry about you don't
[37:50] got no grudges you don't got no feelings
[37:53] like that
[37:54] okay and then he goes on to say greater
[37:57] love hath no
[37:59] man
[38:00] than this
[38:01] that a man
[38:03] lay down his life
[38:06] for his friends
[38:08] ye are my friends
[38:10] if you do whatsoever i command you
[38:14] amen heavenly father we ask you to bless
[38:17] your word to us
[38:18] in your precious name we pray amen amen
[38:22] god bless you may be seated
[38:30] i
[38:31] kind of have a purpose on my heart and
[38:34] uh
[38:35] and uh
[38:36] just to uh
[38:39] uh share something
[38:41] with you
[38:42] and uh for those that are
[38:46] watching uh by way of
[38:50] what do we call that thing stream
[38:52] and
[38:53] everything you know that's not really
[38:55] the stream we want to be on
[38:58] we want to be on the stream of life is
[39:00] to where we want we want to be in the
[39:02] stream of calvary
[39:03] but uh
[39:08] this is on my heart and i i i want to
[39:12] kind of play this evening
[39:14] uh if you could um enjoy it
[39:17] it's just 32 minutes out of the message
[39:20] that brother van creech called
[39:22] forsaking all
[39:25] and
[39:26] it really came on my heart that
[39:29] looking at
[39:31] the
[39:32] church and the church world
[39:35] and even sometimes us
[39:37] as message believers
[39:40] that
[39:41] sacrifice
[39:43] is something that's not
[39:45] really mentioned
[39:47] much
[39:48] and we often uh like to talk about the
[39:52] blessings
[39:54] and the revelations
[39:56] and uh
[39:58] and the great things
[40:00] that
[40:01] god is doing
[40:03] but a lot of times there's
[40:05] little thought
[40:07] ever taken
[40:09] to
[40:11] the sacrifice
[40:13] that men have laid down
[40:17] for so many years that we can enjoy the
[40:20] blessings
[40:22] and i thought the lord gave us a great
[40:24] key here
[40:25] okay it's it's hid
[40:28] within what he spoke he said that
[40:31] i uh
[40:34] i i want to tell you these things and i
[40:37] want to say these things to you and
[40:40] that i have loved you
[40:43] even as my father hath loved me
[40:46] now the very
[40:49] and he said i have kept his commandments
[40:52] well what was his commandment
[40:57] that i lay down my life
[41:00] you understand
[41:01] he's talking and then that's what he
[41:03] refers to he says no man loveth
[41:06] but lay down his life
[41:09] for his friend another scripture says
[41:11] scarcely
[41:12] will a man
[41:14] sacrifice or lay down his life you know
[41:18] for another and so he's saying here he
[41:20] says this is how much that i have loved
[41:22] you
[41:23] that and he's expressing this love and
[41:25] they don't even realize it
[41:27] at this time
[41:29] but he's saying he says if you will have
[41:32] a sacrifice
[41:34] if there's a sacrifice involved
[41:37] in this sacrifice you will find out that
[41:40] that there's joy
[41:43] and that your joy will be filled so this
[41:46] is my commandment if you keep my
[41:47] commandments
[41:49] he said there's going to be great joy
[41:51] and this joy will remain in you and this
[41:54] joy will be full and i think of how far
[41:58] that we begin to find ourselves
[42:02] living
[42:03] from the privileges that god has for us
[42:07] and we find out that
[42:10] that
[42:12] we we wonder
[42:13] why we don't have joy and why we don't
[42:16] have the power
[42:18] that we
[42:20] uh feel that we should have we read the
[42:22] scriptures and it talks about faith and
[42:25] how we should have faith if you have
[42:27] faith to move mountains if you have
[42:29] faith to do this and we look back and we
[42:32] want to grab a hold of that faith and we
[42:34] want to be possessors of that faith
[42:38] and we want to have the signs of that
[42:40] faith in our life and we want to look in
[42:42] the mirror and see somebody there that's
[42:46] powerful and someone that could do those
[42:49] things but you're never going to see
[42:51] that person if the person that you're
[42:54] looking at in the mirror has no
[42:56] sacrifice
[43:01] that's what jesus did he laid down his
[43:04] life
[43:06] so we just didn't become the sons of god
[43:10] we came the sons of god because he paid
[43:13] a price that released us
[43:16] from the thing that was keeping us from
[43:20] being sons and daughters of god and that
[43:22] was sin
[43:24] not only did he release us from sin
[43:27] but he provided for us another spirit
[43:31] other than our spirit
[43:36] because if if
[43:38] we couldn't remain in the love of god
[43:42] and remain in our spirit
[43:46] but that didn't come without a sacrifice
[43:51] a price paid
[43:53] and the very meaning of sacrifice
[43:58] is
[43:59] an act
[44:01] of
[44:02] giving up something
[44:05] one
[44:06] values for
[44:09] the sake
[44:11] of something that is
[44:14] more
[44:14] important
[44:17] and
[44:18] you know
[44:19] so it it's it can't be just something
[44:23] like you know the good will person shows
[44:26] up at your front door
[44:29] and you run get all your rags and you
[44:31] run get all the clothes that don't fit
[44:33] you and it becomes house cleaning
[44:37] you know what i mean so there's there
[44:39] i'm just getting rid of my junk
[44:43] so to speak
[44:45] there's no sacrifice on that because to
[44:48] really have a sacrifice if something
[44:51] that's valued
[44:54] okay
[44:55] and it's not just
[44:56] like i said given away
[44:59] but it's given away for something that
[45:03] you value
[45:04] more
[45:05] or something that's more important you
[45:09] can't lose that i mean you could
[45:11] sacrifice is is is not just
[45:17] something that's just done like i've
[45:19] said giving away stuff giving away stuff
[45:22] but it actually has something to that
[45:25] it's sacrificed for
[45:27] so there's a reason for the sacrifice
[45:30] it's something that is deemed that
[45:33] you're sacrificing for so a sacrifice is
[45:36] something that's given for the sake of
[45:40] something that's more important another
[45:43] if it's more important to us to have the
[45:46] spirit of god if it's more important for
[45:49] us to be about the father's business
[45:52] it's more important for us to to be able
[45:56] to praise somebody through or lead
[45:59] someone to the lord or when someone
[46:02] comes up sick in our midst to lay our
[46:04] hands on them that they recover you've
[46:07] got to understand in order to come to
[46:09] that place to do that it's going to
[46:12] involve some sacrifice somewhere because
[46:16] you deemed that to be more important to
[46:19] you
[46:20] than where you're at
[46:25] and i think that's kind of gone away
[46:28] from us
[46:29] as believers we don't talk about uh
[46:32] sacrificing we don't talk much about
[46:36] fasting
[46:39] but i i've talked to people
[46:43] in my life that
[46:45] didn't follow brother random as we do
[46:48] because they've never been given the
[46:50] revelation that we've been given
[46:53] revelation is a gift of god
[46:57] amen it ought to be deemed as a gift
[47:01] and
[47:02] and it ought to be sought after
[47:05] it's the pearl of great price
[47:08] it's the treasure that's hidden in the
[47:10] field it's the lost coin
[47:15] it's it's what makes you what you are
[47:18] that's right
[47:19] and i talked to many men they sat down
[47:22] and
[47:23] they in the years that i've grown up in
[47:25] the message many of these men of course
[47:27] are gone
[47:28] now but they would tell me they said oh
[47:30] we knew brother branham because i was in
[47:33] brother bram's meetings of course i'd
[47:34] always perk up
[47:36] and i never heard any negativity
[47:39] i heard their common excuse
[47:42] there was no man like him he had the
[47:44] power of god okay there's no man that
[47:46] could discern the thoughts and intents
[47:48] of the heart there is no man that could
[47:50] do these works and and not even realize
[47:53] they contradict the scriptures because
[47:56] no even the scripture says no man can do
[47:58] these things unless the father be with
[48:01] them
[48:05] and then they will say but he got off
[48:10] and you know i thought well if he's off
[48:14] and you're on why can't you do what he
[48:16] did
[48:22] because they're not willing to sacrifice
[48:26] that's right
[48:28] they're not willing the sermon that
[48:30] we're going to listen to a little bit
[48:31] out of it's called forsaking all
[48:35] and what forsake means means to leave
[48:38] completely
[48:41] to abandon
[48:44] and abandon means to leave permanently
[48:48] you don't abandon something and return
[48:51] back to it
[48:53] you understand that's not abandonment
[48:56] that doesn't mean that you've forsaken
[48:58] it
[49:00] you know
[49:01] it's like you say i you move out of a
[49:03] place to another place then that place
[49:06] becomes your vacation home in other
[49:08] words you occasionally visit it you
[49:11] occasionally go there you occasionally
[49:15] uh
[49:17] rent it out or do whatever you do that
[49:19] place isn't abandoned
[49:21] but if you go down and see some old
[49:22] boarded up shack that's just
[49:24] all there and the only thing that lives
[49:26] there is cockroaches and rats and bats
[49:29] that place is abandoned
[49:33] it's been given over to the dark side
[49:37] so it it
[49:38] it
[49:39] it's been abandoned and it's been
[49:41] abandoned
[49:42] permanently
[49:44] and then forsake means to give up
[49:48] completely
[49:50] so you can't forsake something without
[49:53] there being some
[49:55] form of sacrifice involved
[50:01] see you to forsake something means to
[50:04] walk away from something
[50:07] to leave something
[50:09] to to sacrifice so in order to forsake
[50:12] one thing
[50:13] for another
[50:15] there has to be the process in of giving
[50:18] it up
[50:21] i'm going to give this up
[50:23] because i deem this more important
[50:26] so you're sacrificing for something
[50:33] it's so important that we understand
[50:36] that because a lot of times the church
[50:39] feels and people feel that there that
[50:42] there's all these things that are given
[50:45] to them
[50:46] that are like endowments they're like
[50:48] freebies
[50:52] or what we would call entitlements
[50:55] i'm entitled to this i'm entitled to
[50:57] that i'm entitled to all these things
[51:01] and you think well who's sacrificed
[51:07] you know what i mean so all the
[51:09] blessings that we receive are not
[51:13] blessings that came without a sacrifice
[51:19] jesus laid down his life because he
[51:23] deemed that eternal life for you was
[51:26] more important
[51:30] and and
[51:32] it's so easy for us
[51:35] not to just let sacrifice move out of
[51:38] our life to move out of our thinking
[51:42] where we we don't sacrifice our time
[51:48] we don't give up
[51:51] our time
[51:52] for something when you go to help a
[51:55] friend or someone calls you and says
[51:57] could you come help me do this well
[51:59] you're sacrificing that time because you
[52:03] deemed what you're doing for him more
[52:06] important to than sitting on your couch
[52:12] no it it it happens
[52:15] and i think it's wonderful when we can
[52:17] come to the realization and the
[52:20] revelation and the understanding of what
[52:23] sacrifice means
[52:25] what it is and the part that it plays in
[52:30] christianity
[52:33] and the part that it plays in empowering
[52:38] you
[52:43] you take early pentecost
[52:46] they didn't get the holy ghost because
[52:48] they showed up
[52:50] and they had a good meeting and they
[52:52] shouted they
[52:54] fasted
[52:55] and prayed till they got the holy ghost
[52:59] amen
[53:00] they prayed through
[53:02] they separated themselves
[53:07] and you'll hear our prophets say these
[53:09] things
[53:11] but i want to lay down the emphasis of
[53:13] it before that we listen
[53:15] but they they they they walked away from
[53:18] something
[53:19] in order to obtain something that they
[53:23] felt was more important
[53:28] and
[53:30] that
[53:31] part of it
[53:33] leaves us sometimes
[53:36] when we feel that there's nothing more
[53:39] to obtain
[53:43] you understand nothing more to get no
[53:47] greater place to
[53:48] to
[53:50] grow to
[53:51] no higher heights
[53:54] to
[53:55] ascend to
[53:57] and we get to the thought that we think
[53:59] we've got all the revelation we've got
[54:01] all the truth we've got all the power
[54:04] we're we got everything everything's
[54:06] comfortable and and believe it or not
[54:10] you can have the spirit of lady osea on
[54:14] you and in your mind sitting in a
[54:18] message church listening to a message
[54:20] preacher
[54:26] because there's no sacrifice
[54:29] see lady osea had no place else to go
[54:36] they had everything what did they think
[54:39] need of nothing
[54:41] and because they didn't need anything
[54:44] there was going to be no sacrifice to
[54:47] give something up that they thought was
[54:50] more important
[54:55] and we get to the place
[54:57] that
[54:58] we're the top
[55:03] i ran across some good pentecostal
[55:05] people the other day
[55:07] and i figured they were upc
[55:10] and i appreciate it but they were they
[55:12] weren't the modern upc you know the upc
[55:14] had a split don't you
[55:16] the traditional upc and the more modern
[55:19] upc
[55:23] they they had a
[55:25] not a falling out but just a divide
[55:30] and i thought when i i thought i was
[55:32] going to visit with them and
[55:34] and i thought you know
[55:36] because i've heard this many times i
[55:38] thought you know what we would say to
[55:39] them well we're a lot like you but we're
[55:42] one step higher
[55:47] is that high enough
[55:52] do you want to be one step higher than
[55:54] this and one step higher than that
[55:58] i don't want to be i i don't want to
[56:00] have any comparison
[56:05] to any of am i having a vision
[56:09] i just thought i'm seeing one of my very
[56:11] best friends just
[56:13] arrive
[56:15] but anyway that that's uh
[56:18] uh
[56:20] you are saying
[56:21] it's a it's a way of thinking
[56:24] it's a disposition
[56:28] it's an attitude
[56:31] so there's not an attitude in our life
[56:33] or a thought process in our life or a
[56:36] realization in your in
[56:38] in our lives that if i sacrifice it
[56:42] might benefit me some way spiritually
[56:51] or we'll say i want to go to higher
[56:53] ground you want to go to higher ground
[56:55] sacrifice
[56:56] give up something
[56:59] for something you deem more important
[57:03] otherwise we find that we remain the
[57:06] same
[57:09] personally in our personalities in our
[57:12] natures
[57:13] in our accomplishment in our ability to
[57:16] pray we find that we
[57:19] we go in day in and day out and we
[57:21] haven't risen to higher heights and when
[57:24] we bring it back to it the reason that
[57:26] we aren't
[57:28] going to higher heights is because we're
[57:31] striving for him but we're not striving
[57:34] for him with a price
[57:40] we want it free
[57:44] lord send me your blessings
[57:47] give me power
[57:50] well power without character satanic
[57:54] and the first evidence
[57:57] of character is one who will sacrifice
[58:02] who will forsake
[58:08] and
[58:08] it's my desire heart's desire
[58:12] is that we move
[58:15] into th the realities
[58:18] that our prophet messenger spoke to us
[58:21] of
[58:23] that said that the church could obtain
[58:26] to
[58:28] but it's like trying to become a soldier
[58:30] without going through boot camp
[58:38] or no training
[58:42] and and so
[58:46] my desire is
[58:48] is i love talking about the great things
[58:50] of god
[58:52] i love showing and going to the
[58:54] scriptures where god reveals himself
[58:57] and speaking of the things but also i
[59:00] know that the difference that keeps it
[59:05] hear me
[59:06] the difference that keeps it from being
[59:09] in your mind
[59:11] and in your life
[59:13] is the sacrifice that you make for it
[59:24] because
[59:25] you've forsaken something
[59:28] you've sacrificed one way of thinking
[59:31] for another you've sacrificed a certain
[59:34] lifestyle for another
[59:36] so you can't forsake without walking
[59:39] away
[59:42] you can't forsake without leaving
[59:44] something behind
[59:48] and and it's bad
[59:51] when we think that we've achieved
[59:53] everything
[59:55] because we can hear the voice of god in
[59:58] our day that we think we can achieve
[1:00:00] everything because nobody can challenge
[1:00:02] us in our doctrine we think that we've
[1:00:04] achieved so much
[1:00:07] that we get to the place we don't
[1:00:09] sacrifice for anything because nobody
[1:00:11] has got anything that they can offer us
[1:00:14] or tell us
[1:00:15] heady highminded
[1:00:22] but
[1:00:23] to have that
[1:00:26] desire in your heart
[1:00:28] and the understanding and the revelation
[1:00:31] in your life
[1:00:33] that if you sacrifice
[1:00:36] and give up things
[1:00:40] that you can advance
[1:00:42] spiritually
[1:00:47] and you can move towards
[1:00:50] rapturing character
[1:00:52] and rapturing faith
[1:00:54] just think you'll have to be to the
[1:00:57] place that you're so willing to
[1:00:59] sacrifice
[1:01:01] that you'll sacrifice your life
[1:01:05] for the rapture
[1:01:10] everybody that's going to go in the
[1:01:12] rapture is going to be challenged with
[1:01:14] leaving their life behind
[1:01:25] you talked about lot
[1:01:28] leaving
[1:01:30] sodom
[1:01:32] well what happened to his wife she got
[1:01:34] out there
[1:01:36] she didn't know where she was going
[1:01:40] all
[1:01:41] lot knew is that god would take care of
[1:01:43] them
[1:01:46] and she got there where
[1:01:48] she wasn't sure
[1:01:50] if she wanted to pay the price
[1:01:53] she wasn't sure in other words she
[1:01:55] didn't forsake it
[1:01:56] all
[1:01:58] she didn't
[1:01:59] abandon it
[1:02:02] she looked back
[1:02:06] you know the days of ananias and
[1:02:09] sapphira are going on right now
[1:02:12] but they're not dying physically
[1:02:16] they're dying spiritually
[1:02:19] because they didn't want to pay all
[1:02:22] and their sin was was lying to the holy
[1:02:25] ghost
[1:02:27] saying that they were something that
[1:02:29] they weren't
[1:02:31] and
[1:02:32] and having so as we listen to this
[1:02:36] and and brother runs going to give
[1:02:38] examples he's going to talk about it so
[1:02:40] understand what we're trying to get
[1:02:42] across to us tonight
[1:02:44] and i feel this obligated to say this
[1:02:48] from the standpoint of my office not so
[1:02:51] much as me as brother david but i think
[1:02:54] as a pastor that that it's so important
[1:02:57] that you understand that there's always
[1:03:00] two sides to the story
[1:03:06] and
[1:03:08] as we listen i want to read to you the
[1:03:10] last statement
[1:03:12] that we're going to finish up on
[1:03:17] and when you hear this statement it'll
[1:03:19] be done it's statement 134 it says and
[1:03:22] you have to forsake everything
[1:03:25] that's right
[1:03:26] to follow him
[1:03:28] but he that will forsake all and follow
[1:03:32] him
[1:03:33] god pays off
[1:03:35] in the bountiful blessings of richness
[1:03:39] there's nothing to compare with it
[1:03:46] so
[1:03:47] the question is
[1:03:50] are you willing to give something up
[1:03:53] for what you forsake is more important
[1:03:57] another are the bountiful riches
[1:04:00] of god
[1:04:02] so important to you
[1:04:05] that you're willing to forsake
[1:04:08] abandon
[1:04:11] walk away and give up completely
[1:04:14] that you might obtain
[1:04:16] that spiritual
[1:04:18] blessing
[1:04:20] and i really feel it's so important
[1:04:23] that we
[1:04:24] challenge
[1:04:26] ourselves
[1:04:28] and our lives
[1:04:33] look in our lives and say what things
[1:04:35] can i give up
[1:04:37] for the kingdom
[1:04:39] is it a saturday morning with the
[1:04:41] homeless
[1:04:43] is it an afternoon making a meal what
[1:04:46] what where's a place
[1:04:48] for me to sacrifice
[1:04:51] i wonder if we even walk through our
[1:04:52] lives and looked at our lives
[1:04:55] to see if there's anything that i could
[1:04:58] give
[1:04:59] to the kingdom of god
[1:05:05] let me say something
[1:05:07] money is a cheap excuse for time
[1:05:13] money is a cheap excuse for personal
[1:05:16] effort
[1:05:20] so do you want to grow
[1:05:23] i do
[1:05:25] you say oh brother mcgregor you
[1:05:27] sacrifice all the
[1:05:28] i haven't laid my life down for anybody
[1:05:34] i've never went without a meal
[1:05:40] in fact i overlooked my life and i i
[1:05:43] don't really even know if i've ever
[1:05:44] seems that i've ever had a challenge or
[1:05:47] went through a hard time his grace and
[1:05:49] his mercy have been so rich and good
[1:05:55] but if i want more
[1:05:57] i'm going to have to give up more
[1:06:00] and i just hope that this speaks to you
[1:06:04] this evening because i really think
[1:06:08] it's important
[1:06:10] that we just don't sit around
[1:06:12] as a bunch of quote unquote
[1:06:16] message believers
[1:06:17] and don't do a thing
[1:06:24] you know what i mean
[1:06:26] show me your faith
[1:06:28] without your works
[1:06:30] and i'll show you my faith by my works
[1:06:33] lord bless you i hope you enjoy
[1:06:35] this if you hope if you we don't need to
[1:06:38] stand
[1:06:39] but if you'll turn in your bibles
[1:06:42] dr brother brown is going to make one
[1:06:44] quick reference to a small scripture
[1:06:47] found in
[1:06:49] mark the 10th chapter
[1:06:51] and the 28th verse and we're just going
[1:06:53] to listen to 31 minutes
[1:06:55] but if it
[1:06:56] and the purpose of it is is i want you
[1:06:59] to understand that the messenger is
[1:07:01] talking about
[1:07:03] everybody that's ever achieved anything
[1:07:06] for the kingdom
[1:07:08] had to walk away and forsake something
[1:07:14] so may god
[1:07:15] richly bless you i know you'll enjoy
[1:07:18] hearing the word of god
[1:07:28] scripture here tonight i want to read
[1:07:31] and take a text
[1:07:33] and i pray that god will bless it
[1:07:35] if you want to read it when you get home
[1:07:37] it's in mark the 10th chapter and the
[1:07:40] 28th verse
[1:07:42] then peter begin to say unto him
[1:07:45] lord we have left all and have followed
[1:07:49] thee
[1:07:50] now
[1:07:52] i would like to take a text to build a
[1:07:54] little context on there
[1:07:56] of forsaking all
[1:07:59] and then
[1:08:00] in a few moments we will pray for the
[1:08:02] sake
[1:08:04] and now
[1:08:07] you who are acquainted with mark the
[1:08:09] 10th chapter
[1:08:11] backgrounded they're just jesus had been
[1:08:13] talking previously on divorce
[1:08:17] and then
[1:08:18] he also had a very striking thing to
[1:08:21] happen
[1:08:23] there was a rich young man
[1:08:26] came running to him and said
[1:08:28] a good master
[1:08:30] what could i do to have eternal life
[1:08:33] and he told him to keep the commandments
[1:08:35] the young man said i did this from my
[1:08:37] youth or what commandments and he told
[1:08:39] him what they were he said i did this he
[1:08:42] said but one thing you like if you want
[1:08:44] to be have eternal life be perfect and
[1:08:46] sell all you've got give it to the poor
[1:08:49] take up your cross and follow me
[1:08:51] let's follow that young man just for a
[1:08:53] few moments before we enter the text to
[1:08:55] give a background
[1:08:57] now you see that young man was asked
[1:09:01] to forsake all
[1:09:04] but he refused to do it
[1:09:06] and
[1:09:07] sometimes if we apply prosperity and
[1:09:10] riches and so forth success but this
[1:09:13] young man was a successful young man
[1:09:16] and still didn't have eternal life
[1:09:19] so sometimes
[1:09:20] success doesn't always mean that god's a
[1:09:23] blessing
[1:09:24] but let's follow him we find him here
[1:09:26] now in his youth young
[1:09:29] perhaps a handsome young dress fellow
[1:09:31] the bible said that jesus loved him he
[1:09:34] must have a nice good
[1:09:36] uh tender conscience he must be a
[1:09:39] a very fine something or he would never
[1:09:42] win the admiration of the lord jesus
[1:09:45] because when jesus looked at him he
[1:09:47] loved him
[1:09:49] he must add a kind expression and nice
[1:09:51] look to him a clean
[1:09:53] gentleman straight cut boy
[1:09:56] and he walked up to jesus perhaps
[1:09:58] thinking in sincerity and said i would
[1:10:01] like to know what i could do to have
[1:10:03] eternal life
[1:10:05] and when the
[1:10:06] he had to depart with what he had to
[1:10:09] have eternal life then
[1:10:11] the question was at the gate where you
[1:10:14] can make it and that question lays
[1:10:15] before every one of us
[1:10:18] and jesus
[1:10:19] really asked him to forsake all he had
[1:10:23] take up his cross and follow him
[1:10:25] and we know the story he went away
[1:10:28] sorrowful because he had great riches
[1:10:31] then jesus turned and said
[1:10:33] how hard it would be for a rich man to
[1:10:35] enter the kingdom of heaven like a
[1:10:38] a camel to go through the eye of a
[1:10:40] needle but that would be impossible with
[1:10:43] man but he said with god it's not
[1:10:45] impossible
[1:10:46] let's follow this young ruler the next
[1:10:49] time we find him in the bible
[1:10:51] he never as soon as he rejected the
[1:10:54] opportunity to follow jesus when it was
[1:10:56] laid down to him pretty stiff
[1:10:58] you see we want to hold on to everything
[1:11:01] that we can and then follow jesus
[1:11:03] but sometimes jesus wants us to turn
[1:11:05] loose of everything so we get both hands
[1:11:08] on him
[1:11:10] sometimes we think that just because it
[1:11:13] if we've got a hope
[1:11:15] reminds me of a little thing i usually
[1:11:17] tell all my two little girls they're not
[1:11:20] so little now
[1:11:22] and uh they're pretty good-sized girls
[1:11:24] but when they were little one of them is
[1:11:26] rebecca she's the oldest
[1:11:29] and sarah she's the little one
[1:11:31] and becky has blue eyes and sarah has
[1:11:35] brown
[1:11:36] but
[1:11:37] they're both
[1:11:38] daddy's girls you know
[1:11:40] and so they wait up to see me come home
[1:11:42] and they're always
[1:11:44] uh
[1:11:45] loved to see me and
[1:11:46] so
[1:11:47] becky is kind of was kind of a tall
[1:11:50] skinny sort of a girl and
[1:11:52] sarah was a little kind of a short
[1:11:54] little bitty fella
[1:11:56] and so they were
[1:11:58] waiting up for me to come home one night
[1:12:00] i've been away on meetings and they knew
[1:12:03] i'd be home so they thought they'd just
[1:12:04] wait a little while and if i come home
[1:12:07] they wanted to see me
[1:12:09] well the sandman must have sprinkled
[1:12:11] sand in their eyes they got sleeping
[1:12:13] finally they went to bed
[1:12:16] out in their room and i got in late
[1:12:19] so i got him was real tired went to bed
[1:12:21] and after the meetings and so forth i
[1:12:24] get so tired i can't sleep after a few
[1:12:26] weeks of meeting and
[1:12:28] i slept about uh two or three hours got
[1:12:31] up went in the
[1:12:33] in the living room and just sat down in
[1:12:35] a a chair
[1:12:37] i was sitting there in the chair
[1:12:40] early in the morning and after a while
[1:12:42] uh
[1:12:43] becky turned over in her bedroom and she
[1:12:46] realized it was daylight and she looked
[1:12:48] out through the hall and she seen me
[1:12:50] sitting out there in a chair out of the
[1:12:52] bed she come
[1:12:53] just as hard as she could
[1:12:55] those little skinny long legs just
[1:12:57] they're reaching for
[1:12:58] well that um that alarm sarah
[1:13:02] and i don't know whether your children
[1:13:04] does that or not but my
[1:13:05] you get something for the oldest one and
[1:13:07] the second one takes the hand-me-down
[1:13:09] and sarah was wearing project
[1:13:12] rebecca's pajamas the feet way big you
[1:13:16] know too big far and she out of the bed
[1:13:19] she coming them big feet flying and she
[1:13:21] could hardly keep up with rebecca so
[1:13:24] rebecca beat her to me
[1:13:26] and she jumped up on my lap drove both
[1:13:29] arms around me
[1:13:30] just kind of she was on my right knee
[1:13:34] and her long legs reached down to the
[1:13:36] floor she's pretty well balanced it kind
[1:13:38] of reminds me of some of the greater
[1:13:41] first organizations you know that come
[1:13:43] along you know they've been here a long
[1:13:45] time kind of long-legged and
[1:13:47] so forth pretty well balanced and
[1:13:50] here comes sarah along the little young
[1:13:52] church you know it hasn't been out very
[1:13:53] long and
[1:13:55] she uh
[1:13:56] kind of
[1:13:57] seen it back here he had repeater beat
[1:13:59] her there so rebecca had her arms around
[1:14:01] me she looked around she said sarah my
[1:14:03] sister
[1:14:05] i want you to know one thing
[1:14:07] she said i was here first
[1:14:12] and she said i've got all of daddy
[1:14:16] and there's none left for you
[1:14:19] they try to tell us that you know all
[1:14:21] the time
[1:14:23] said i was here first and i've got all
[1:14:25] the daddy and there's none left for you
[1:14:28] poor little sarah dropped her head down
[1:14:30] her little lip fell down she started to
[1:14:32] go away in the tears and those big brown
[1:14:33] eyes
[1:14:34] becky had her head laying over on my
[1:14:36] shoulder kind of hugging me i took my
[1:14:38] finger and reached like that to stare
[1:14:39] and pushed the other leg out
[1:14:41] here she come and jumped up on the other
[1:14:44] leg and
[1:14:45] what she
[1:14:46] she couldn't balance herself her little
[1:14:47] legs wouldn't hit the floor but she was
[1:14:50] on the leg any housing so she was
[1:14:52] toddling around like that well keep her
[1:14:54] from falling i just got both arms and
[1:14:57] put them around her like at the holder i
[1:15:00] was holding her up close to me and she
[1:15:01] put her little lower head against me for
[1:15:03] a little bit she raised up and looked at
[1:15:05] becky and said now rebecca my sister
[1:15:08] so i want to tell you something too
[1:15:12] she said it may be so that you've got
[1:15:15] all a daddy but i want you to know that
[1:15:16] daddy's got all of me
[1:15:20] so that's about the way we want we don't
[1:15:22] want we want him to have all of us
[1:15:26] so therefore in all to do it we've just
[1:15:29] got to walk out there by faith and
[1:15:31] believe him that's all and just trust
[1:15:33] we can't explain it there's no way to
[1:15:35] explain it we just believe it and take
[1:15:38] it like that
[1:15:39] this rich young man he would not give
[1:15:42] himself to christ and so he went away
[1:15:44] and we find him later that he was he had
[1:15:47] prospered so much until his barns were
[1:15:49] so full until he said soul take thy rest
[1:15:53] oh he had prospered everything he had so
[1:15:55] much he had need for nothing but
[1:15:57] something taken place the next time we
[1:16:00] saw him he lifting up his eyes in hell
[1:16:05] had seen a beggar far off in the bosoms
[1:16:07] of abraham
[1:16:08] that was because he wasn't willing to
[1:16:11] forsake all to follow the lord jesus
[1:16:15] then
[1:16:16] when this taken place and the young
[1:16:19] ruler would not give up what he had to
[1:16:21] follow jesus
[1:16:22] it must have dawned on peter i believe
[1:16:25] it was him that made the remark or asked
[1:16:28] the question raised it
[1:16:30] and said now
[1:16:32] we have forsaken all
[1:16:34] to follow you
[1:16:36] we have
[1:16:37] forsaken all
[1:16:39] look what we have done
[1:16:41] we left our homes we left our families
[1:16:43] we left our lands we left everything
[1:16:45] that we had to follow you
[1:16:49] it began to dawn on him
[1:16:51] maybe he'd been so carried away in the
[1:16:53] work
[1:16:53] watching christ and so forth that he had
[1:16:56] never dawned on him that he had left his
[1:16:58] home
[1:16:59] he left his family
[1:17:01] he had left his father his mother
[1:17:04] he left all he had to follow jesus
[1:17:07] but that's exactly what god requires
[1:17:12] forsake all and follow him that's god's
[1:17:16] requirement
[1:17:18] we've got to do it too
[1:17:20] sometime we've got to forsake
[1:17:22] our very thoughts
[1:17:24] if our thoughts about anything is
[1:17:27] contrary to god's word we've got to
[1:17:29] forsake our own thinking
[1:17:32] and follow him
[1:17:34] and the only way we can follow him is
[1:17:36] follow his word
[1:17:38] obey it
[1:17:39] have a god's request and god's
[1:17:42] requirement is that we
[1:17:44] forsake all and follow him
[1:17:47] but in doing so we find out sometimes we
[1:17:51] have to forsake our friends
[1:17:54] many times that's a hard thing to do
[1:17:57] now many people when they first come
[1:17:59] into christ
[1:18:01] and be filled with the spirit
[1:18:04] maybe like women has been having a some
[1:18:06] kind of a party they've been going to
[1:18:08] every certain certain night where
[1:18:10] they've been playing bunco
[1:18:12] in the neighborhood uh acquainted with
[1:18:14] all the the neighbors and so forth and
[1:18:17] belonged to certain societies in the
[1:18:18] neighborhood
[1:18:20] and uh they go play bunco and these
[1:18:22] women
[1:18:23] you know is going to say something about
[1:18:26] it
[1:18:27] they're not going to understand it but
[1:18:29] yet you have to forsake that thing
[1:18:32] because it's not right to gamble play
[1:18:34] cards
[1:18:35] and you've got to forsake that if you
[1:18:38] follow christ
[1:18:40] sometimes the women in our churches
[1:18:42] that's used to wearing immoral clothes
[1:18:44] like shorts and
[1:18:46] these
[1:18:48] dungarees
[1:18:49] and the bible says an abomination to god
[1:18:51] for a woman to put on such she's no
[1:18:54] matter what she thinks she's got to
[1:18:56] forsake that
[1:18:58] sometimes we find women when they come
[1:19:00] into the way and get saved they've been
[1:19:02] used to cutting off their hair
[1:19:04] and they want to be popular like the
[1:19:06] rest of the world but they find out it's
[1:19:09] a hard thing because they'll call you
[1:19:11] old-fashioned whenever you go to
[1:19:13] dressing like a christian acting like a
[1:19:15] christian living like a christian
[1:19:17] they'll call you old-fashioned but
[1:19:19] you've got to forsake all
[1:19:22] the following
[1:19:24] jesus said of the scripture says he that
[1:19:26] loves the world are the things of the
[1:19:28] world the love of god is not even in him
[1:19:32] okay it takes forsaking off
[1:19:35] there when you were willing to forsake
[1:19:37] all and follow him
[1:19:39] then if ye abide me and my word in you
[1:19:43] you can ask what you will and it will be
[1:19:45] done for you
[1:19:47] but you cannot knowing that those things
[1:19:50] are wrong
[1:19:51] you know they're wrong the bible's
[1:19:53] against them
[1:19:54] card playing cigarette smoking drinking
[1:19:58] wearing immoral clothes and
[1:20:01] then claiming to be a christian
[1:20:03] if that spirit in you does not condemn
[1:20:06] that then there's something wrong with
[1:20:08] the spirit that's in you because the god
[1:20:10] who wrote the word is the word and the
[1:20:13] word is in you and it condemns you it's
[1:20:16] got to and if it doesn't you're being
[1:20:18] deceived
[1:20:20] how can the holy spirit write something
[1:20:22] and you turn around and do contrary to
[1:20:23] it and say the holy spirit is leading
[1:20:25] you you can't do it
[1:20:27] so smoking cigarettes drinking whiskey
[1:20:29] playing cards cutting hair wearing
[1:20:31] shorts all these other things are wrong
[1:20:34] sinful wrong and you'll never get
[1:20:36] anywhere until you quit it
[1:20:39] it's creeping into our pentecostal moves
[1:20:42] shame on you
[1:20:43] you ought to be ashamed no wonder we
[1:20:45] can't have a worldwide revival no way we
[1:20:48] can't have a pentecostal revival
[1:20:50] something's happened
[1:20:52] that's right we've let down the bars and
[1:20:55] things are taking place that should not
[1:20:57] take place
[1:20:58] therefore you must forsake all to follow
[1:21:00] christ
[1:21:01] you must forsake your your own ideas you
[1:21:04] must cope with his word and never will
[1:21:07] the holy ghost ever deny any word it
[1:21:10] ever spoke
[1:21:11] and the bible is wrote by the holy
[1:21:13] spirit the bible said so and if the
[1:21:16] bible words is god in the beginning was
[1:21:20] the word awards with god and the word
[1:21:22] was god and the word was made flesh and
[1:21:25] dwelt among us now the word is made
[1:21:28] spirit dwelling in us
[1:21:30] for i will be with you even in you to
[1:21:33] the end of the world the consummation
[1:21:37] now that same god that wrote the bible
[1:21:40] is in you you're not your own you're
[1:21:43] dead to the things of the world you're
[1:21:45] dead to your own thoughts and the mind
[1:21:48] that the mind that was in christ be in
[1:21:51] you
[1:21:53] there
[1:21:54] then you're forsaken all to follow him
[1:21:56] not your own thoughts what he says not
[1:21:59] my will dying lord
[1:22:01] then you'll begin to line up with god's
[1:22:03] word could stay there a long time but
[1:22:05] i'll just run on a little farther
[1:22:08] but you say what do i get then forsaken
[1:22:11] all forsaking on
[1:22:12] what do i get you can expect the world
[1:22:15] to make fun of you
[1:22:17] you can expect the world to call you all
[1:22:19] kinds of
[1:22:21] unhonorable names
[1:22:24] they'll call you
[1:22:26] anything that they can call you
[1:22:28] you'll be despised and rejected
[1:22:33] jesus because of him being emmanuel
[1:22:37] god dwelling in him it made him so odd
[1:22:40] to his own church to his own church
[1:22:42] excommunicated him as soon as he come in
[1:22:45] they was the one who hung him on the
[1:22:47] cross they was the one who condemned him
[1:22:50] he loved people his whole heart was far
[1:22:53] people but he had to forsake everything
[1:22:55] in order to follow god
[1:22:57] and so do we have to forsake everything
[1:22:59] in order to follow god
[1:23:02] now what do i get in return
[1:23:06] we don't expect we sometimes i think we
[1:23:08] ministers make it a little too
[1:23:10] uh much flowers for the the convert all
[1:23:15] come to christ everything is lovely but
[1:23:17] you see
[1:23:18] it isn't like that in the way that
[1:23:21] saying it everything's a flower bed of
[1:23:22] ease because no christians the bible
[1:23:25] said all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:23:29] shall suffer persecution
[1:23:31] so if if you're not suffering
[1:23:33] persecutions for christ's sake then
[1:23:36] there's something wrong
[1:23:37] if the devil ain't after you he's got
[1:23:39] you
[1:23:40] it's all because as long as he's after
[1:23:43] you that's the sign he hasn't got you
[1:23:44] yet but if he isn't at you it's a sign
[1:23:47] he has got you here
[1:23:48] so just remember as long as he's a
[1:23:50] blasting at you you're a few jumps ahead
[1:23:52] of him yet and just keep on going but
[1:23:55] all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:23:58] shall suffer persecutions
[1:24:02] he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[1:24:04] for so persecuted that the prophet
[1:24:06] switch was before you
[1:24:08] that's right don't go the hang down face
[1:24:10] and say well uh oh done it i guess
[1:24:13] i just can't stand for somebody to talk
[1:24:15] about me and say i'm old-fashioned on
[1:24:17] this side or the other oh you you should
[1:24:20] be exceedingly glad
[1:24:22] happy because of it
[1:24:24] because you can bear the reproach of his
[1:24:27] name and by keeping his commandments it
[1:24:30] caused you to do that but i want to say
[1:24:33] this to hurry up as quickly as we can
[1:24:35] god will not
[1:24:38] in no wise be in debt to any man
[1:24:42] god won't be dedicated to any man
[1:24:46] if you have did that for god
[1:24:48] forsaken all god will repay you a
[1:24:52] thousand-fold
[1:24:54] right
[1:24:56] god will pay it back you forsake the
[1:24:59] things of the world
[1:25:01] and the world and the things of the
[1:25:02] world and god will repay you so many
[1:25:05] times
[1:25:06] how many is a witness of that year
[1:25:08] tonight while we all know that god will
[1:25:11] repay
[1:25:13] now
[1:25:14] let's take just a few characters
[1:25:16] that did forsake all
[1:25:18] let's take first
[1:25:20] the father of faith abraham
[1:25:23] abraham for
[1:25:25] own land
[1:25:27] the property he owned and everything
[1:25:29] else
[1:25:30] he was called out of the chaldea the
[1:25:33] city of era
[1:25:35] and he for suck his land
[1:25:37] his home
[1:25:39] his people
[1:25:40] and all and followed
[1:25:43] god
[1:25:45] he had to forsake everything leave it
[1:25:48] behind
[1:25:49] he for suck is
[1:25:51] his land his property
[1:25:54] down in chaldea
[1:25:57] in uh he forsaken his property
[1:25:59] and god gave him the whole promised land
[1:26:04] god pays back with a lot of interest
[1:26:07] he gave him up there that day when he
[1:26:10] met him he said rise up abraham look
[1:26:13] east north west south
[1:26:17] i give it all to you
[1:26:20] it's all yours
[1:26:22] that's the matter with christians
[1:26:24] tonight
[1:26:25] god gives it to us but we're afraid to
[1:26:28] investigate it
[1:26:31] when you become a christian you're heir
[1:26:33] to ever promise in the bible
[1:26:35] right everything that god promised is
[1:26:37] yours
[1:26:38] it's just like a great big arcade
[1:26:41] and by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:26:43] into this arcade which is christ
[1:26:46] well if i if somebody give me something
[1:26:48] i'm gonna look around and find out what
[1:26:50] i own
[1:26:52] i think that's what christians ought to
[1:26:53] do tonight
[1:26:55] find out what you've got
[1:26:58] if something gets us a little high up
[1:27:00] and i can't reach it i'll get me a
[1:27:01] stepladder climb up to it you know
[1:27:04] something seems a little hard to reach
[1:27:05] in the bible or god's promise i'll stay
[1:27:08] on my knees and climb jacob's ladder
[1:27:10] until i reach it because it's mine god
[1:27:12] gave it to me
[1:27:13] if divine healing's promised in the
[1:27:15] bible
[1:27:16] i'm sick i'll stay there until god gives
[1:27:18] it to me because it's a promise
[1:27:21] god promised i'd forsake the world and
[1:27:22] give me the holy ghost i'll stay right
[1:27:24] there until he gives it to me
[1:27:26] because he promised it
[1:27:28] if god promised to give me the desire my
[1:27:30] heart and the desire my heart is the
[1:27:32] right thing
[1:27:33] i'll stay there for god gives it because
[1:27:35] it's a promise and uh forsaking all the
[1:27:38] world i want to walk after him and he
[1:27:41] will pay i know that to be true it's
[1:27:44] exactly right what did he do he for suck
[1:27:48] his land his country and god gave him
[1:27:51] the entire a province or all the whole
[1:27:54] um continent of the um
[1:27:57] of palestine
[1:27:58] he forsak his little bitty piece of land
[1:28:01] down there maybe an acre where his house
[1:28:03] set
[1:28:04] in his old house to receive everything
[1:28:06] there wasn't palestine
[1:28:08] good
[1:28:10] but the first thing he had to separate
[1:28:11] himself
[1:28:13] he separated himself from his people
[1:28:16] all of his loved ones the old associates
[1:28:18] that he used to
[1:28:20] to run around with
[1:28:21] his boyhood friends that come down from
[1:28:23] the babbling with him and all these
[1:28:26] brothers sisters and all these friends
[1:28:29] that he knew his associates when god
[1:28:31] called him he said separate yourself
[1:28:33] from your kindred
[1:28:36] get away from all of it
[1:28:38] now that was hard
[1:28:39] but he separated his self from all of
[1:28:42] his kinfolks
[1:28:44] why because they would not agree with
[1:28:46] him
[1:28:47] could you imagine them agreeing an old
[1:28:48] man here 75 years old with a 65 year old
[1:28:52] wife saying you know what i met god out
[1:28:54] here and he told me he's going to have a
[1:28:56] a baby now but sarah
[1:28:59] well then his doctor friend would have
[1:29:01] said the old man's off at his head
[1:29:03] but he'd already bought up the pins and
[1:29:05] burt eye and everything else getting
[1:29:06] ready for it because he knew he was
[1:29:09] going to have it that's right nothing to
[1:29:11] it why god promised him
[1:29:14] right
[1:29:15] now if that bunch of people want to
[1:29:17] laugh at him and think he'd gone off at
[1:29:19] his head they'd do every believer that
[1:29:21] way all of abraham's seat has the same
[1:29:24] thing
[1:29:26] it's right
[1:29:28] sometimes your church will even turn you
[1:29:30] out
[1:29:31] your clubs your
[1:29:32] your places you belong to your
[1:29:34] fellowships in the neighborhood your
[1:29:36] associates sometimes your boyfriend or
[1:29:39] your girlfriend or turn you down
[1:29:42] but god requires you to forsake all to
[1:29:45] follow him
[1:29:47] for sake everything is contrary to him
[1:29:52] abraham forsaken his people what did he
[1:29:55] get in back of it what come besides that
[1:29:57] he become the father of many nations
[1:30:02] god made him the father of many nations
[1:30:06] what little he gave up then look what he
[1:30:08] could become jesus said he will forsake
[1:30:10] me will have fathers mothers and so
[1:30:11] forth look what abraham got by forsaken
[1:30:14] all and following him yes sir father of
[1:30:17] many nations but first he had to
[1:30:19] separate himself from all unbelief and
[1:30:23] even from his cold lukewarm church
[1:30:26] member brother loft
[1:30:28] he had to forsake himself for that
[1:30:29] everything has got unbelief in it you
[1:30:31] have to separate yourself anything if
[1:30:34] it's a creed if you're
[1:30:36] in a church and all you're depending on
[1:30:39] is a creed and don't believe the word
[1:30:41] and the words contrary to the creeds
[1:30:43] contrary to the word you'll have to
[1:30:45] forsake that
[1:30:46] you'll have to forsake everything
[1:30:49] and god never did bless abraham until he
[1:30:53] totally obeyed him
[1:30:55] abraham won't take his daddy along the
[1:30:56] old man with the fly in the ointment all
[1:30:58] the time finally he died they unlocked
[1:31:01] his strife and everything and then as
[1:31:02] soon as abraham fully obeyed god and
[1:31:06] separated himself and let lot go on down
[1:31:08] there in the good lands wherever he
[1:31:10] wanted to go down in sodom then god
[1:31:13] appeared to abraham and said lift up
[1:31:14] your eyes i give the whole thing to you
[1:31:18] abraham was the one who separated
[1:31:21] he was the one who separated all to
[1:31:23] follow uh to follow god
[1:31:26] and he is the father of faith
[1:31:28] he is the one that we believe to be the
[1:31:30] faithful one the promise was made to
[1:31:32] abraham and his seed we being dead in
[1:31:34] christ our abraham seed heirs with him
[1:31:37] according to the promise
[1:31:39] israel forsake egypt
[1:31:42] they forsuck the old lands down there in
[1:31:45] egypt
[1:31:46] to receive what
[1:31:47] palestine
[1:31:49] they come from that horrible place
[1:31:53] down there in egypt past masters
[1:31:56] and there's many people today
[1:31:58] young women out here on the street
[1:32:01] smoking
[1:32:03] drinking

[1:32:06] on the radio the other day these police
[1:32:08] had to come rest that bunch of young
[1:32:11] women down there out in the street

[1:32:18] they call a thing and out there on the
[1:32:20] street gone crazy in their mind
[1:32:23] see
[1:32:24] really if a young lady's got an ounce of
[1:32:26] decency about her her or a young man
[1:32:29] either one that thing is a taskmaster
[1:32:31] that drives them to do that
[1:32:34] you forsake that and god will give you a
[1:32:36] dance oh my you sure will he'll give you
[1:32:40] one if you'll just forsake that but
[1:32:43] you've got to forsake all those things
[1:32:45] to have it you just can't continue with
[1:32:48] both of them
[1:32:49] he got palestine abraham did other than
[1:32:52] israel did he got palestine
[1:32:55] far land

[1:33:33] sunlight where there's driving under
[1:33:35] task masters to come out there and walk

[1:33:39] holy spirit a pillar of fire that was
[1:33:42] leading them to a promised land
[1:33:44] same thing today

[1:33:50] things that saw the world to walk in the
[1:33:52] light of god

[1:33:56] they also
[1:33:58] left the old garlic pots of egypt flesh
[1:34:01] pots
[1:34:02] down in egypt what did they get when
[1:34:04] they first sucked them old flesh pots
[1:34:05] they got to eat angel's food
[1:34:08] manna come down out of heaven to take
[1:34:10] the place of garlic now if you have
[1:34:12] never eaten nothing but garlic
[1:34:14] let me tell you something god's got a
[1:34:16] heaven full of angels food defeated
[1:34:19] that's right
[1:34:21] angels food that's what they got instead
[1:34:24] of that
[1:34:26] instead of the old um garlic of egypt
[1:34:28] they left the muddy waters of egypt what
[1:34:32] did they get out there to drink from the
[1:34:34] rock that was smitten in the wilderness
[1:34:36] of the pure crystal waters of god
[1:34:40] they left the old muddy waters of egypt
[1:34:42] the old denominational upside down muddy
[1:34:45] waters that's what we have to do
[1:34:47] sometime today leave that old creed and
[1:34:49] denomination it says days and miracles
[1:34:51] just pass them guys are crazy they're
[1:34:53] just a bunch of holy rollers leave that
[1:34:56] thing behind and come over here and

[1:35:02] plunged beneath the blood lose all their
[1:35:04] guilty stains
[1:35:06] yes sir leave that old water of mud all
[1:35:10] mixed up with doubt and flusterations
[1:35:12] and arguments and stews and everything
[1:35:14] else
[1:35:15] going down at night time and have a soup
[1:35:17] supper and boil up some old chicken and
[1:35:19] sell it for 50 cents a plate to pay the
[1:35:21] preacher whenever you get over here

[1:35:26] commandments and walk with god you'll
[1:35:28] pay your tithes and a preacher will get
[1:35:30] along fine if you'll just take god's way
[1:35:32] of doing it trying
[1:35:35] old muddy waters to drink from the rock
[1:35:38] they left them boasting physicians of
[1:35:41] egypt saying we are the smartest man in
[1:35:43] the world today they left the boasting
[1:35:46] physicians to be with the great
[1:35:47] physician amen
[1:35:49] i'd like to see some physician today
[1:35:52] carry on like that great physician did
[1:35:54] then people were in the wilderness for
[1:35:57] 40 years
[1:35:59] and they come out without a feeble man
[1:36:01] the one among them
[1:36:03] it was the feeble person among them 40
[1:36:06] years
[1:36:07] there was over 2 million of the people
[1:36:09] that come out at that time
[1:36:11] how many babies is born every night
[1:36:14] how many sick
[1:36:16] i think did i like to go to dr moses
[1:36:19] look at his satchel and see what kind of
[1:36:21] prescription he give him wouldn't you
[1:36:22] like to see that i imagine there's a lot
[1:36:24] of doctors that like to look it up on
[1:36:26] that prescription
[1:36:28] well i can tell you i've read it
[1:36:30] let me tell you what it is
[1:36:31] i'm the lord and heals all our diseases
[1:36:33] that's only
[1:36:35] that's all he needed
[1:36:37] for they pro-suck
[1:36:39] the
[1:36:40] boasting physicians to be with the great
[1:36:43] physicians yes sir
[1:36:45] therefore suck down there the people it
[1:36:48] said the days of miracles are passed
[1:36:50] there's no such a thing as miracles of
[1:36:52] war they or suck that to do what what
[1:36:55] did they do then to be right in the
[1:36:58] presence of where miracles has happened
[1:37:00] day by day
[1:37:02] amen
[1:37:04] the people today that says that there's
[1:37:05] no such a thing as miracle there's
[1:37:07] something wrong with their mind
[1:37:10] trying
[1:37:11] a person told me one time that i
[1:37:13] wouldn't care what you've done i didn't
[1:37:15] care i can't you know how much proof you
[1:37:17] got said i just don't believe it i said
[1:37:19] certainly not
[1:37:21] you never see it you're too blind to see
[1:37:23] it
[1:37:24] that's why i said it's not for
[1:37:25] unbelievers it's for believers the
[1:37:27] believers see it
[1:37:29] that's right
[1:37:31] fellow said to me one time met me on the
[1:37:33] street said you're wrong in your
[1:37:35] doctrine i said it's the bible
[1:37:38] he said you're wrong he said then i'm
[1:37:40] against you said then smite me blind
[1:37:42] paul smaller man blind one time said
[1:37:44] smite me blind i said i i can't do it
[1:37:47] you're already blind
[1:37:50] you're
[1:37:51] how can i do what your father the
[1:37:52] devil's already done
[1:37:55] you're already blind
[1:37:56] a man to say a thing like that is is so
[1:37:59] blind he don't know daylight from dark
[1:38:02] you can't discern between the two
[1:38:04] life or death that's really being blind
[1:38:07] yes sir
[1:38:09] yes the great physician was with them
[1:38:11] and they seen miracles happen sure the
[1:38:15] disciples what did they forsake they had
[1:38:18] nets fishnets they forsake their
[1:38:20] fishnets to walk with him and see his
[1:38:24] signs and miracles and his power
[1:38:27] of being the messiah
[1:38:29] anybody wouldn't give up a day's fishing
[1:38:31] to follow that there's something wrong
[1:38:34] they left their nets full of fish
[1:38:37] they started pulling that as biggest
[1:38:39] cats they ever had they first soaked
[1:38:40] every bit of it to follow him
[1:38:43] because they believed in their heart
[1:38:45] that he was messiah
[1:38:47] and they wanted to follow him to see if
[1:38:50] the signs would follow him as messiah
[1:38:53] and they got to see it god forsake
[1:38:56] anything in the world i don't care what
[1:38:59] it is to see jesus christ manifest
[1:39:02] himself especially when it's manifested
[1:39:04] in my life that i know it i pass from
[1:39:07] nothing to life
[1:39:10] i know by taking him at his word that he
[1:39:12] has saved me from a life of sin and i
[1:39:16] know that the holy spirit dwells within
[1:39:18] me i see his signs everywhere pointing
[1:39:21] that i know that he's the same yesterday
[1:39:23] today and forever forsaken all
[1:39:27] i'm willing to forsake anything
[1:39:29] i belong to a fine organization a fine
[1:39:32] church one of the best in the country
[1:39:34] but they said billy you're going to lose
[1:39:36] your mind and become a holy roller right
[1:39:38] there i said you might as well take my
[1:39:39] fellowship card right now because i'm
[1:39:42] going to follow the holy spirit that's
[1:39:44] right
[1:39:46] true and you have to forsake everything
[1:39:48] that's right to follow him but he that
[1:39:51] will forsake all and follow him god pays
[1:39:53] off in the bountiful blessings of riches
[1:39:56] there's nothing to compare with it all
[1:39:58] right
[1:40:05] somebody's still listening
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:15] now
[1:40:16] i know that you're not drinking
[1:40:19] and smoking
[1:40:20] and doing those things
[1:40:22] that that's
[1:40:24] not
[1:40:25] what we're looking at
[1:40:27] tonight we're looking at the principle
[1:40:30] do you understand if god ever does one
[1:40:32] thing
[1:40:33] he always does it the same
[1:40:36] so he said that
[1:40:38] in order to go from one place to another
[1:40:42] you have to leave
[1:40:44] something
[1:40:46] and he pointed out all these people left
[1:40:49] something
[1:40:51] and
[1:40:51] and
[1:40:52] but they left something to obtain
[1:40:55] something that they deemed greater
[1:40:59] and i like what brother madam said here
[1:41:01] he said
[1:41:02] i would forsake anything in the world i
[1:41:05] don't care what it is
[1:41:08] to see jesus manifesting himself
[1:41:14] especially when it's manifested in my
[1:41:18] life
[1:41:21] now that's a that's desiring something
[1:41:25] but if you follow the principle
[1:41:28] and you
[1:41:29] you begin to
[1:41:30] to see it
[1:41:33] you've got to you've got to
[1:41:36] leave something
[1:41:38] you've got to come out of something in
[1:41:40] order to do it god promised something so
[1:41:43] if there's a promise in the scripture
[1:41:45] the promise of the spirit of god the
[1:41:47] promise of being laying your hands on
[1:41:49] the sid whatever the promises of god are
[1:41:53] if you see those things
[1:41:56] you understand and you see those things
[1:41:59] and you want to obtain those things
[1:42:02] then you've got to realize if you don't
[1:42:05] have those things in the place you're at
[1:42:11] then there's got to be some spiritual
[1:42:14] movement in your life to get to the
[1:42:17] place where those things can be there
[1:42:22] so you've got to look
[1:42:25] it's not condemnation
[1:42:28] but it's the understanding of the
[1:42:31] principle
[1:42:34] that god pays his debts
[1:42:38] he will not be indebted to you
[1:42:42] so is it willing to fast for is it
[1:42:44] willing to pray for
[1:42:46] is it willing to spend time on your
[1:42:48] knees he said god promised it he said
[1:42:51] stay on your knees till you get it well
[1:42:53] that takes sacrifice
[1:42:57] it takes something
[1:43:00] and so
[1:43:03] i just don't know how to express it to
[1:43:05] you but sometimes it's a principle that
[1:43:07] we don't teach very much in the message
[1:43:10] we just think we're entitled to
[1:43:12] everything and we don't have to do
[1:43:14] anything for it
[1:43:16] we don't have to change our life we
[1:43:18] don't have to give up something we like
[1:43:20] to do and not everything
[1:43:24] it doesn't mean it's evil
[1:43:27] i know of an experience in my life and i
[1:43:30] could just testify for my experience
[1:43:34] and
[1:43:34] i i look back on it today
[1:43:38] you know i was a lover of the ocean
[1:43:41] i love to fish i got
[1:43:43] opportunity to fish i started fishing
[1:43:46] when i was eight years old a man took me
[1:43:48] fishing i love sport fishing i love sea
[1:43:51] fish i love catching tuna i love being
[1:43:53] on the ocean
[1:43:55] and and it came in my life i had just
[1:43:59] heard the message
[1:44:02] of brother branham
[1:44:04] you just had just got done
[1:44:06] listening to
[1:44:09] the third
[1:44:11] uh message
[1:44:13] that i heard and it was called
[1:44:16] choosing of the bride
[1:44:19] and i knew i had to leave
[1:44:21] california
[1:44:24] and i remember i made my decision in my
[1:44:27] heart
[1:44:28] i'm going to leave
[1:44:30] and that day my phone rang
[1:44:35] and
[1:44:37] on the other end was
[1:44:39] captain tom beach
[1:44:42] and tom beach was the captain of a boat
[1:44:44] called the el navigante
[1:44:47] a beautiful
[1:44:49] yacht
[1:44:51] and he took
[1:44:53] people fishing and on cruises like the
[1:44:56] president of mexico and
[1:44:58] senators and people from all over the
[1:45:00] world and and the
[1:45:03] jack cousteau's
[1:45:05] uh crew and things were gonna rent that
[1:45:08] boat and take it out and so he offered
[1:45:10] me a job
[1:45:12] to go on that book he knew i could cook
[1:45:14] a little and and do things and
[1:45:18] it was like my whole
[1:45:22] life's desire
[1:45:25] i mean if i could work on that boat
[1:45:28] i mean i pictured myself you know all
[1:45:32] curly long hair and and just like
[1:45:35] leather skin
[1:45:36] just out in the suns you know with my
[1:45:38] flip-flop marks on my feet and
[1:45:42] just i mean it was everything i ever
[1:45:45] dreamed of
[1:45:49] can i remember i had to
[1:45:50] i had to
[1:45:53] make a decision
[1:45:56] was i willing to give that up
[1:46:00] for this
[1:46:02] i didn't know this
[1:46:06] i was a hippie
[1:46:08] willing to leave california
[1:46:11] go to
[1:46:13] i didn't know where or what was ahead of
[1:46:15] me
[1:46:17] but
[1:46:18] i i it just dawned on me i i like peter
[1:46:21] said i didn't even realize i forsake all
[1:46:25] right it's just this message was deemed
[1:46:28] so important to me it meant so much to
[1:46:30] me it had contacted something inside of
[1:46:33] me that i didn't even know how to
[1:46:35] describe i didn't know about the seed of
[1:46:38] god i didn't know about the book of life
[1:46:40] i didn't know about being predestinated
[1:46:43] you know sometimes we do a lot better
[1:46:45] serving god without so much head
[1:46:46] knowledge
[1:46:48] the bible says that knowledge puffeth up
[1:46:55] just to see
[1:46:57] and understand what that he did for me
[1:47:00] now i understand i never forsook
[1:47:03] him without him blessing me a hundred
[1:47:06] times
[1:47:09] what that thing could have ever blessed
[1:47:11] me
[1:47:13] i'd have probably just got seasick and
[1:47:15] no telling all that he does
[1:47:18] but i want to leave you with this
[1:47:21] tonight this bill he's going to come and
[1:47:23] lead us in some worship
[1:47:27] you still forsake
[1:47:30] all your christian life
[1:47:32] you're always going to be leaving
[1:47:34] something behind for something you deem
[1:47:36] better
[1:47:38] all your christian life is based on
[1:47:40] sacrifice
[1:47:42] god's showing you something a higher way
[1:47:46] god's showing you a better attitude
[1:47:48] god's showing you a better spirit god's
[1:47:52] showing you some works that you can do
[1:47:55] and it always involves a sacrifice it
[1:47:58] always involves a forsaken it always
[1:48:00] involves moving to higher ground
[1:48:05] and the day we think we've arrived we
[1:48:08] know that we haven't
[1:48:12] you know probably talked about the
[1:48:14] minute you think you know everything
[1:48:18] you know nothing
[1:48:20] so
[1:48:21] i want to leave that because
[1:48:25] i want to see
[1:48:27] god manifested in us all
[1:48:31] i want to see people come through the
[1:48:32] door that
[1:48:34] are sick and they don't have no place
[1:48:36] else to go
[1:48:37] not just our people i mean i don't care
[1:48:39] if they ever come to church
[1:48:44] here and say we know a god
[1:48:49] let us pray for you
[1:48:51] that god will
[1:48:52] bless you
[1:48:54] and then walk away
[1:48:56] with the blessings of god
[1:48:59] but am i willing to sacrifice for that
[1:49:01] am i willing to give it up
[1:49:04] what what am i
[1:49:06] willing to do
[1:49:08] you know
[1:49:09] it's so easy
[1:49:11] to get
[1:49:12] so comfortable
[1:49:14] and so i i want to encourage you to
[1:49:18] to
[1:49:20] look for higher ground
[1:49:24] look for
[1:49:26] what can lie ahead of you
[1:49:28] in a greater christian life
[1:49:31] and a greater
[1:49:34] desire to be more like him and ask
[1:49:37] yourself what are you willing to pay for
[1:49:39] that
[1:49:43] you know in my own personal
[1:49:45] view
[1:49:46] i always thought that
[1:49:49] this is me personally and i got no
[1:49:51] scripture no nothing just the thought
[1:49:53] that run through my mind
[1:49:55] that
[1:49:56] if that ritual and ruler
[1:49:58] would have followed jesus
[1:50:00] he just might have been the messenger
[1:50:03] to the gentile church
[1:50:06] there's no telling
[1:50:09] what he could have been in christ
[1:50:12] because of what he ended up being in the
[1:50:14] world
[1:50:17] and how could you ask yourself where do
[1:50:19] you want to store your treasures
[1:50:24] you know are we willing to forsake and
[1:50:27] give up to move higher
[1:50:29] with god i think we're willing right
[1:50:32] so i think if we start doing that in our
[1:50:35] personal lives
[1:50:37] and i'm not trying to give a list of
[1:50:38] what you give out because i'm not
[1:50:40] talking about giving up sin
[1:50:43] i'm talking talking about giving up
[1:50:45] something that's good
[1:50:47] for something that's better
[1:50:49] and i hope you understand and i i wanted
[1:50:51] to play this for you so you could
[1:50:53] understand
[1:50:54] that all these men forsook
[1:50:57] to obtain
[1:50:59] and if you will forsake
[1:51:00] you'll obtain
[1:51:02] because it's a promise of god
[1:51:04] god bless you brother billy
