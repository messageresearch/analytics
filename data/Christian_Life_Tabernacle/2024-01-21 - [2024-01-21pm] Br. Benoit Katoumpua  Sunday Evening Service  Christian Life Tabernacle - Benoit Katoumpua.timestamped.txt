[30:48] remainder of the service in your hands
[30:49] Lord
[30:51] Jesus asking you to be with your people
[30:53] father Lord granted I pray and ask this
[30:56] in your precious holy and wonderful name
[31:01] amen you want
[31:03] to turn with me real quick to Genesis 17
[31:08] thank you
[31:26] musicians
[31:35] when you're there Let the church say
[31:40] Amen the scripture reads and when Abram
[31:43] was 90 years old and nine the Lord
[31:46] appeared to Abram and said unto him I am
[31:50] the almighty God walk before me and be
[31:53] thou perfect and I will make my Covenant
[31:56] between between me and thee and will
[31:59] multiply thee
[32:01] exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face
[32:03] and God talked with him saying as for me
[32:07] behold my Covenant is with
[32:09] thee and thou shalt be a father of many
[32:13] nations neither shall thy name and more
[32:16] anymore be called Abram but thy name
[32:19] shall be
[32:20] Abraham for I for a father of many
[32:23] nations have I made
[32:26] thee you may be seated for a
[32:30] moment you know last time we got the
[32:34] chance to to speak to you spoke about
[32:38] which story will you
[32:40] choose and uh we talked about how in one
[32:45] story The Devil Wants to tie it down to
[32:48] your birth and how you came into this
[32:50] world and iniquities Lord came speaking
[32:53] lies and the condition in which you were
[32:55] born which wasn't the the correct
[32:57] condition and then you had the other
[32:58] side which is what God has said of thee
[33:02] and Abraham being the father of our
[33:04] faith you know it it it it struck me in
[33:07] this verse in verse 5 where he
[33:11] says I have made thee not I will make
[33:16] he's the he's 99 years old and the
[33:19] Lord's speaking to him of this of the
[33:21] seed he'll have and how it'll be through
[33:24] that seed that he'll
[33:25] bless the world and so forth and you
[33:28] realize the condition in which he's
[33:30] speaking to
[33:33] Abraham you look at it seriously in 90
[33:37] something with a kid sums off but he the
[33:42] Lord says I have made thee this is a
[33:44] present tense being this isn't a far off
[33:47] no right now you are I have made thee so
[33:52] and what did he make him he said a
[33:53] father of many nations right and I
[33:56] started started to think on this
[33:58] and as I read the story of Abraham I was
[34:01] sitting in the clever speaking with John
[34:04] just fellowshipping a little bit and we
[34:07] came up start talking about Abraham and
[34:09] started to think
[34:12] about we here's this guy this idolator
[34:16] right he's knows nothing about God he's
[34:19] living the way he chooses to but then
[34:21] God interrupts him where he's at and
[34:25] says you know I'm I'm going to make a
[34:27] covenant with you and this it's not
[34:29] going to have nothing to do with you
[34:30] Abraham it's going to it's I'm making it
[34:32] with you because the last time I tried
[34:34] to have you do something with it you
[34:35] messed it all up so now it's me it's
[34:38] unconditional I'm making the Covenant so
[34:40] regardless of the condition you're in
[34:42] regardless of who how you see yourself
[34:44] regardless of what you see it's what
[34:46] I've said and what I said will be right
[34:50] and and it got it got me thinking a
[34:52] little bit and it brought me to the
[34:54] sermon where brother Brandon preached
[34:56] and
[34:57] Israel and the church number two if you
[35:00] just uh go to that real quick Israel and
[35:04] the church
[35:08] 53326 in
[35:10] [Music]
[35:24] paragraph It's paragraph 24
[35:28] said notice three stages justification
[35:30] by faith sanctification through the
[35:32] blood baptism of the Holy Spirit then
[35:35] Perfection glorified the Bible said
[35:37] those who he justified this is to the
[35:39] spiritual mind he also glorified is that
[35:42] right he who he justified then if he
[35:44] justified us now we are already
[35:47] glorified in his State not he will he
[35:50] hath glorified say that's deep isn't it
[35:53] but that's what the scripture says God
[35:55] told Abraham I I have blessed you and
[35:58] I've made you a father not I will I have
[36:02] I have made you and you'll come to me in
[36:04] an old age you're going to be saved I've
[36:07] already done it I've already said so you
[36:09] haven't got nothing to do with it it's
[36:13] unconditional and that that it it really
[36:16] Sparks something because I sort of think
[36:18] just just of my life alone for myself
[36:21] often times when I'm reading the
[36:22] scriptures I'm I'm listening to tapes
[36:24] and I'm I'm I'm trying the best I can
[36:27] for what I see to try to make myself
[36:30] into what I'm seeing and there there's a
[36:33] problem in that because anytime it's me
[36:36] trying to do something to have a result
[36:40] it's this it's almost the same thing
[36:41] that that happened with Adam and Eve
[36:44] they were trying to do something and
[36:46] that didn't work and it it it brought a
[36:50] comfort to me to to think about this
[36:52] before I even came into this world God
[36:55] already spoke something over me and I'm
[36:58] I'm here now not not now understanding
[37:02] but beforehand I had no idea what was
[37:04] spoken of me born in the a family raised
[37:07] in the household of the message you
[37:09] listen to tapes you you hear your dad do
[37:11] devotionals your mom speak to you and so
[37:13] forth about the word and you can kind of
[37:16] get lost in that thinking that because
[37:17] you're hearing it and and it's being
[37:19] spoken to you that it's made you
[37:21] something but it's got to be personal
[37:23] it's it's it's got to be something that
[37:25] you receive for yourself right and and I
[37:28] I started to look I said man we we find
[37:30] ourselves sometimes in so many different
[37:32] conditions right you you you have one
[37:34] for for an example if there was a
[37:36] crippled man here with no legs and I
[37:38] told him I said sir in two weeks time
[37:39] we're racing on
[37:41] foot you you look and say well he's
[37:44] crippled he's got no legs see that's how
[37:47] that's how God speaks what you see and
[37:49] what he speaks don't always make sense
[37:52] so you see the crippled man with no legs
[37:53] but God says in two weeks the legs are
[37:55] going to come back and we're going to
[37:56] have that
[37:57] see so we have to start understanding
[37:59] that when we we look into the word when
[38:01] we start reading the Bible we listening
[38:03] to tapes you got to understand that
[38:05] separate yourself put yourself aside
[38:07] it's not about you it's not about your
[38:09] efforts it's in spite of the condition
[38:12] you're in he's going to have a bride
[38:14] it's in spite of the condition you're in
[38:16] he's going to have his way our problem
[38:18] is we want something to do with it we
[38:21] want to get in there and do something
[38:23] well you know I feel like if if if if I
[38:25] don't if I don't come to church every
[38:26] Sunday if if I don't come to church
[38:28] every Wednesday first service and second
[38:30] service then man I I I I I guess I'm not
[38:32] saved all those things are good if you
[38:34] do them but that's not what makes you a
[38:36] Believer right like brother Brandon
[38:38] would say sometimes uh people people
[38:41] claim to be Christians right they they
[38:43] you can put on Christianity you can try
[38:45] to like I look the I'm the best type of
[38:47] Christian I got my suit on I got my tie
[38:50] it looks right right I got everything
[38:52] lined up I look the part so if I look
[38:54] the part maybe I am the part but you
[38:57] know who if you're the part or not when
[38:59] it's just you alone in your room just
[39:01] you alone at the house at work at school
[39:04] wherever it is you know if you're the
[39:06] part right it's it's it's it's it
[39:09] started me thinking man you start
[39:11] reading in your understanding like for
[39:14] Abraham to even believe what he's being
[39:16] told in the condition he's in 99 years
[39:21] old and you're told you're going to have
[39:22] a
[39:23] kid to the carnal mind something's off
[39:28] but we know the caral mind is enmity
[39:29] with God so we don't we don't look to
[39:31] those things and and and often times
[39:34] even I begin to think about some of the
[39:38] conditions that you know people that are
[39:39] close to me find themselves in
[39:42] where whether you've been praying for
[39:45] the sick a loved one that you've had
[39:47] that hasn't you you you haven't seen the
[39:50] the miracle happened just yet you
[39:52] haven't
[39:53] seen the prayer you've been making come
[39:56] to the conditions just seem to get worse
[40:00] the conditions just seem to look like
[40:02] there's no way out they just seem to
[40:03] look like well man it just it keeps
[40:06] getting worse it keeps getting worse
[40:08] remember brother brandom says the
[40:10] scripture will show it that when he was
[40:13] 75 when Abram was 75 that's when the
[40:15] Lord met
[40:16] him and then it was 25 years from 75
[40:22] until it happened the scripture says he
[40:24] will when when he came to him the LA
[40:27] with uh right before I think it was in
[40:29] mamry if I'm if I'm not mistaken that he
[40:32] told him he said according to the time
[40:34] of life see God made the promise and
[40:38] then the condition was according to the
[40:40] time of life now Abraham didn't know the
[40:42] time of Life all he knew was God said it
[40:45] and but he staggered not at the promise
[40:47] that he was given I wonder if often
[40:50] times when we hear things when we say
[40:52] you know I have a desire to be closer
[40:53] with God I have a desire to see more of
[40:56] God in my life I have a desire for this
[40:57] I have a desire for that I wonder if we
[41:00] murmur in our
[41:01] hearts I wonder if we question it
[41:03] because of what we see that God how can
[41:06] this be how is this possible I've got
[41:09] this this son I've got this daughter
[41:10] that I've been praying for that's not
[41:12] living the way they ought to live but
[41:14] Lord you said they will Lord you you
[41:16] said This Promise is unto me and unto
[41:18] the children and them who are far off
[41:19] but look how they're living I wonder if
[41:22] we start doubting God at times and start
[41:25] questioning but but God never told us
[41:27] the time of life but he's always in
[41:29] season he never fails the same way he
[41:32] interrupted Abraham he'll come where
[41:34] you're interrupt you
[41:38] amen and then I I started to to to think
[41:42] some often times we we we bring up U the
[41:45] fact that Sarah that she laughed when
[41:49] when given the promise and and told she
[41:52] laughed in her heart she said me this
[41:54] this old age that I am but she wasn't
[41:56] wasn't the first one that laughed it was
[41:58] Abraham when God told Abraham the first
[42:01] time he laughed in his heart and said me
[42:03] he said Lord but ishmail is there you
[42:05] know I've already got ishmail and but
[42:07] the Lord told him that's not the
[42:09] air right see sometimes God gives you a
[42:12] promise and you try to make it happen
[42:14] and then a portion of it you might think
[42:16] oh wait maybe it'll come through this
[42:18] path and then you come to realize that's
[42:20] not the way like those that was your
[42:23] effort it looked good at first but it's
[42:25] not the way in which God wanted it to
[42:27] come forth right and and it it it struck
[42:30] me like for I have made thee if we can
[42:35] only understand who it is and hands we
[42:37] are in we're not in just any type of
[42:40] man's hand we're not just
[42:42] in a a regular thing or no we're in
[42:45] Eternal God's hands who knew all things
[42:49] and the sermon who is this mzc brother
[42:51] bam said he numbered he knows each
[42:54] number of hair you got he knows the
[42:55] color there's nothing that eludes him
[42:58] that's the hand we're in so regardless
[43:01] of the condition we find ourselves in
[43:04] regardless of the condition you came
[43:06] into church tonight I really appreciate
[43:10] what brother Matthew preached this
[43:11] morning it it it it really struck me it
[43:14] really struck me because especially when
[43:16] he talked about the faith and the
[43:20] footsteps footsteps of faith and you
[43:22] start looking at it well this word if
[43:25] you're walking in the word then you'll
[43:28] start seeing the things of the word come
[43:30] alive in your life it's no different
[43:33] from what Enoch did the scripture says
[43:35] Enoch walked with God till he left so we
[43:37] have this word that's been given to us
[43:39] now how do we expect to leave if we
[43:41] don't walk in
[43:43] it we've got to feed we got to continue
[43:46] going and it will change us and we'll
[43:48] walk right out of
[43:55] here
[43:57] it it it it brought me to the thought of
[44:01] of Mary when when God and Gabriel is
[44:03] speaking to her and Gabriel says you
[44:06] shall conceive a child and the question
[44:08] she asks she says well how can this be
[44:11] and brother Brandon would say that the
[44:13] Holy Ghost will overshadow you the
[44:15] scripture says the holy ghost power
[44:19] brother Brandon comes behind and he he
[44:21] says it in a in a different way same
[44:23] same meaning he said the Holy Ghost will
[44:25] make it to
[44:26] pass not you will make it pass but the
[44:30] Holy Ghost will make it to
[44:32] pass and I the the way it struck me it
[44:38] was and this this is just how I speak to
[44:40] myself it's like well Ben you got a lot
[44:44] of good ideas so you think you want to
[44:48] do this you want to do
[44:50] that you think you ought to do this you
[44:52] think you ought to do that but really I
[44:55] ought to do nothing nothing but
[44:57] wait if I wait then I'm certain if I'm
[45:01] waiting on God the answer he's going to
[45:04] give me will always be perfect it never
[45:06] misses never
[45:08] misses brother Brandon would say you
[45:12] notice back in the in the same sermon of
[45:15] Israel in the church he says Jesus said
[45:19] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[45:21] father in Heaven is perfect how could
[45:23] you ever be perfect but in the sight of
[45:26] Christ tonight every born again
[45:28] Christian is perfect I'm just as perfect
[45:31] in God as Christ was you are too to
[45:34] every other believer for it's not my
[45:37] Holiness it's his Holiness God can't
[45:39] accept mine I have none but I come in
[45:42] Christ by faith and by Christ I'm in him
[45:45] and perfect in the sight of God look by
[45:48] one Spirit we're all baptized into one
[45:50] body and become members of this body in
[45:53] Romans 8:1 there is therefore now no
[45:56] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[45:58] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[46:00] the spirit and a man that's in Christ
[46:02] Jesus walks after spiritual things to
[46:05] the world it's carnal mind it's
[46:07] foolishness but to them that believe
[46:09] it's everlasting life amen there you are
[46:12] oh how marvelous then what can harm you
[46:15] you're in Christ and just as sure as God
[46:17] raised Jesus from the dead will come in
[46:20] Christ amen yes we got to God's done
[46:23] promised it for just as sure as that
[46:26] body goes up I'm in that body I have to
[46:29] go with
[46:31] it the power of a promise we we've got
[46:35] to understand what's been given to us
[46:37] this message was preached a bunch of
[46:39] promises spoken of you spoken about you
[46:43] but it just it remains in the book is so
[46:45] long as you just keep it there but it
[46:48] was never given to us to just stay in
[46:50] the book it was given to us for it to be
[46:53] manifested in our lives that every
[46:55] promise we see we have the right to say
[46:58] Lord you said it I want it give it to me
[47:02] he's Duty bound because he said it about
[47:04] you remember for I have made thee see
[47:08] Abraham didn't see all he couldn't
[47:11] really comprehend everything God was
[47:13] going to do through him but all he knew
[47:16] is Lord you said it and he staggered not
[47:18] and stuck with Lord because you said it
[47:21] I'm going to stay here until it comes to
[47:23] pass brother Brandon would dramatize it
[47:25] and say
[47:26] one week the
[47:27] Sarah are you are you do you have a
[47:30] child yet no okay the next month no the
[47:34] next month no the next month no well
[47:36] it's coming anyhow until it finally came
[47:39] he didn't waver brother B would brother
[47:42] B would go he Abraham probably went to
[47:44] the store and was trying to buy this was
[47:46] trying to get this for the baby and the
[47:47] neighbors and so forth were mocking and
[47:49] laughing at him you're 90s something
[47:51] years old how do you expect this to
[47:52] happen what power do you think is going
[47:54] to make you have this child it's no
[47:57] different from when the devil Whispers
[47:59] to you when you're stuck and you're
[48:01] bound in sin and he tells you how do you
[48:04] expect to get out of this
[48:06] hole how do you expect to for depression
[48:09] to leave you for anxiety to leave
[48:12] you how do you expect for you to get out
[48:14] of this condition this addiction you
[48:16] have you can't seem to get over you try
[48:18] two weeks it comes back how do you
[48:21] expect to get out of it see the devil
[48:23] wants you to forget all all his plan is
[48:26] if he can just make you
[48:28] forget that God already spoke it over
[48:32] you that's all he's looking for if he
[48:36] can get you to dwell on the fact that
[48:38] you know what it's my
[48:41] efforts man I I I can't do it man I've
[48:44] tried I've tried Ben you don't
[48:46] understand I've tried I've tried man
[48:49] I've been at the altar time and time
[48:51] again I've prayed I've prayed I've
[48:53] prayed I've talked to so and so I've
[48:55] talked to so and so but I can't seem to
[48:57] stop you know I I give my best effort
[49:00] you know like you know I deleted it I
[49:02] removed it off my phone I did this I did
[49:04] that but then I download it back two
[49:05] weeks later and it's like man I'm trying
[49:07] B you don't understand I don't know how
[49:09] to stop God never asked you to
[49:14] stop C can can you imagine it's always
[49:16] eluded me why brother Brandon with the
[49:18] man that had a cigarette problem would
[49:21] go and buy him cigarettes to give it to
[49:24] him I'm like in this day and
[49:28] age
[49:29] what but he knew what he was doing he
[49:32] knew that that brother got a True
[49:35] Deliverance one that you could tempt him
[49:38] with as many cigarettes as you wanted to
[49:40] he wouldn't waver that's the kind of
[49:42] Deliverance God does see when it's you
[49:45] trying to deliver yourself when it's you
[49:47] trying to get rid of something in your
[49:48] life your own efforts it it might hold
[49:51] you for a year it might hold you for a
[49:53] pretty good long time but over time
[49:55] you'll start to waver you'll start to
[49:57] fall and you'll see man I thought I got
[49:58] delivered but I don't think I really did
[50:00] well you never really
[50:02] surrendered if you truly surrendered and
[50:04] you left it in God's hand you would see
[50:06] a complete
[50:09] change it's just I I want us to focus on
[50:14] conditions and and bring it down to
[50:16] where you're at in your condition
[50:19] remember like I said the devil has one
[50:21] motive if he can get you to be stuck on
[50:24] your own efforts on something that you
[50:25] can do then as he's doing that what he's
[50:29] causing you to do is you become numb
[50:33] when the minister is up up here speaking
[50:35] to you telling you that this promise is
[50:38] yours you don't have to be bound by this
[50:40] you don't have to be bound by that you
[50:41] don't have to be bound by that time and
[50:43] time again I remember sitting in that
[50:45] seat Matthew Billy Brother David
[50:47] preaching about things that I was bound
[50:49] by and saying you don't have to be bound
[50:50] by that and I'm just hearing it but it's
[50:53] not really sinking in because you have
[50:55] that other voice in your head saying man
[50:57] when you get out of here all you got to
[50:58] do is just delete it just get rid of it
[51:00] just do this just do that just do this
[51:02] just do that when all I really had to do
[51:04] was just fall and say Lord have your way
[51:07] whatever it is have your way whatever
[51:09] you need to do if you've got to sheer me
[51:11] clean whatever it is that's got to
[51:12] happen Lord have your way but I can't
[51:15] see my own I don't want to see anything
[51:17] that I can do I don't want to see
[51:18] anything that I can muster up anything
[51:20] that I can do by My Own Strength my
[51:22] strength fails me but Lord your strength
[51:25] in my weakness your strength is made
[51:30] perfect and you you you start to read
[51:34] and and continue reading when when when
[51:36] when something strikes
[51:38] and just condition and it it got me
[51:41] thinking of some of the places that I've
[51:42] been
[51:44] I some of you could attested this when
[51:46] David made the cry though I make my bed
[51:48] in hell you're there
[51:52] like if he hadn't have spoken over over
[51:55] me if he hadn't have said for I have
[51:58] made you about me where would I be bring
[52:03] it down to yourself where would you be
[52:06] though you make your bed in hell he's
[52:08] there because he spoke it about you
[52:11] unconditionally which he removed you
[52:13] from the equation the moment he said I
[52:16] make this Covenant with
[52:17] you so regardless of how far you go I
[52:21] will pull you back amen now how you come
[52:24] back you can kick against the PRI but
[52:27] he's going to get you one way or another
[52:30] you can come by walking you come by
[52:31] crawling in a Stretcher whatever the
[52:33] case may be but he's going to get you if
[52:36] he spoke it over you he is Duty bound to
[52:39] get
[52:45] you he goes
[52:47] and I want to go to the uncertain sound
[52:52] preached in
[52:53] 19 if I'm not mist
[52:57] Aken
[52:59] 1960
[53:14] 128 and I I I really just want us to to
[53:18] really understand that regardless of the
[53:21] condition you see if God said it it has
[53:23] to happen
[53:28] brother Brandon would
[53:31] say Abraham I heard that you said you
[53:33] was going to have a baby paragraph 308 I
[53:35] heard that you're going to have a baby
[53:37] he he he he that's an uncertain sound
[53:39] see but Abraham had done heard another
[53:42] sound that downed all that out glory to
[53:45] God I don't care how long he waits going
[53:47] to have it anyhow how you know Abraham
[53:51] God said so now he did God come down and
[53:55] talk to you yes how you know let me hear
[53:57] him he talked to me not you oh my
[54:02] Hallelujah that that that's comforting
[54:05] that's comforting Oh my he talked to me
[54:08] not you well go on said go on you old
[54:11] unbeliever you don't believe anyhow I
[54:13] believe him see so just keep on going
[54:15] that's it going to have a baby anyhow 25
[54:18] years passed but before that time come
[54:20] they was teing and laughing God said you
[54:23] know what I'm just going to make you
[54:25] take you away from them pack up all your
[54:28] clothes and things get ready get
[54:31] out you know often time when God gives
[54:33] you a vision of something or something
[54:35] that he wants you to come to right he he
[54:37] gives he gives you the end result which
[54:40] is what you know what brother B would
[54:41] preach and he said when God saw you in
[54:43] this day he saw you perfect see he gives
[54:46] you the end result but then then he
[54:48] starts ministering onto you how to get
[54:50] there and part of getting into that
[54:52] Perfection is separating right sometimes
[54:54] you you can't you can't receive what God
[54:56] has for you cuz you're in the wrong
[54:58] Company the company you're with is
[55:00] holding you back so when you're making
[55:02] all these efforts make you're trying to
[55:04] do this you're trying to do that and it
[55:06] keeps failing stop and look who am I
[55:08] around who's in my life what is it that
[55:11] I'm doing am I feeding the way that I
[55:13] ought to am I doing this your eyes and
[55:15] ears are to Gateway To Your Soul what
[55:17] are the things that you're doing and how
[55:20] is that going to affect the end result
[55:23] right he says pack them up separate
[55:25] yourself from that bunch of unbelievers
[55:27] I'm going to give you a little church
[55:28] over here some people will believe you
[55:30] get away from that Old cold formal
[55:32] denominations get out of here walk with
[55:34] me alone God never blessed him till he
[55:37] completely did that separated himself
[55:39] from all unbelief and he'll never bless
[55:42] you till you do the same take all them
[55:45] old superstitions away from you maybe
[55:47] it's so maybe it's not if you come to be
[55:49] prayed for this morning you come with
[55:51] the real faith God said so and that
[55:54] settles it that's it God said so that's
[55:57] all there is to it God said so he said
[55:59] it and that settles it don't have no
[56:02] more fuss about it think about it all
[56:05] right and and often times that's I can
[56:08] only speak of of
[56:09] myself often time this is this really
[56:12] what happens you hear it God said so and
[56:15] you start fussing about it you hear him
[56:17] say this is what you have to be this is
[56:19] what you will be I've made you thus and
[56:23] then you start thinking man how am I
[56:25] going to get there you know I'm fighting
[56:27] with this I'm struggling with this I'm
[56:29] man I just I just don't see how my path
[56:32] is going to align there but and all
[56:35] that's for not you're thinking
[56:38] incorrectly it's not how are you going
[56:40] to get there it's how when and how is he
[56:43] going to get you there it's his job to
[56:46] do that he is the one that made the
[56:48] promise with you so because he made the
[56:50] promise he has to take you from where
[56:52] you're at but you can't be taken from
[56:54] from where you're at lest you realize
[56:56] where you're at if you think you're good
[56:58] if you think you're living right you
[57:00] think you're acting right you're
[57:01] thinking you're in the condition that
[57:02] you should be in but you know you're not
[57:05] that's a dangerous place to be you no
[57:07] one can be helped in the state of
[57:10] believing I'm a Believer but still one
[57:13] the other foot out the door you think
[57:15] you're doing everything right when you
[57:17] come here you fit the part the moment
[57:18] you leave you're somebody completely
[57:20] different you don't know what condition
[57:21] you're in it's the condition of the age
[57:24] you're luk War the scripture says he
[57:26] spews you out of his mouth if you're
[57:27] lukewarm in order for you to understand
[57:30] I am in the wrong place I need to get
[57:32] out of here you have to think the place
[57:34] you're in is wrong but if you don't
[57:37] think it's wrong you'll dwell there
[57:38] you'll stay there well you know what I
[57:40] you know I you in times past the reason
[57:43] why you know I I couldn't have this
[57:44] happen is because you know I would look
[57:46] at this and I would do this and do that
[57:48] you know now I think what I'm going to
[57:50] do is I'm just going to unfollow those
[57:51] people and then uh I'm going to start
[57:53] doing this instead dead but you still
[57:56] left that gate open you still allowed
[57:59] him to enter in somewhere as long as
[58:02] long as you give the devil just a small
[58:03] door soon you'll find out it's wider
[58:05] than you thought because it's just a
[58:08] little bit all he needs is a little bit
[58:10] God wants us to be fully surrendered
[58:13] fully surrendered and trusting in Him
[58:16] that's what he he's called us to in this
[58:18] day when the prophet of God would speak
[58:19] and say we're living beneath our means
[58:21] what does that mean we're not sold out
[58:23] the way that we we we used once was we
[58:26] have so many cares of this world so many
[58:28] things that bother us and take up real
[58:32] mental real estate in our mind that have
[58:34] absolutely nothing to do with
[58:37] us I think Time and Time what am I going
[58:39] to do when I'm 40 I'm not 40 what am I
[58:41] thinking
[58:42] about all all I need to be thinking
[58:45] about is right here and right now Lord
[58:48] what is it you have for me right now
[58:50] we'll cross 40 when I get there Lord
[58:52] willing but right now what is it that
[58:54] you have for me right now if we can get
[58:57] our mind to the right now then we can
[59:00] start attacking those issues that we
[59:02] face right now as long as we keep
[59:04] looking forward we drag and hold on to
[59:07] things because our eyesight's wrong but
[59:10] Brandon would say that people always
[59:11] know what God's going to do what God has
[59:14] done but fail to see what he's doing
[59:16] it's a true condition of the age we
[59:19] often look forward and back but we don't
[59:20] see right now how do I expect to get
[59:23] there if I'm not there now
[59:25] now they say the best image or the best
[59:29] example that you have of what you'll be
[59:31] 10 years from now is who you are now we
[59:33] ought to bring that down spiritually you
[59:36] want to be this spiritual person that
[59:38] that God just uses you that every time
[59:40] you speak that it's God speaking and so
[59:42] forth you understand in order to get
[59:44] there there's a
[59:46] sacrifice it's it's a die to
[59:49] S where lord it's not me but it's you
[59:52] you speak you have your way amen though
[59:55] I think of these things and so forth no
[59:57] it's not about that Lord what would you
[59:59] have me do could we live that way where
[1:00:02] we say Lord you know what before I go
[1:00:04] outside and get this gas is it your will
[1:00:06] no but I need gas no my car is empty I
[1:00:10] need gas but Lord is it your will would
[1:00:14] you have me go who knows where are the
[1:00:17] Miracles what if you prayed and your
[1:00:20] tank was filled up Lord so it be let it
[1:00:23] be let it be let it be see we we often
[1:00:28] just stick in this realm all we see is
[1:00:31] man you know I got to go get in my car I
[1:00:32] got to drive I got to go over there I
[1:00:34] got to pump the tank I got to do this I
[1:00:36] got to do that I got to do this and you
[1:00:38] realize all the devil's trying to get
[1:00:40] you to do
[1:00:43] here he wants you to glorify your own
[1:00:46] efforts but as long as you're glorifying
[1:00:48] your own efforts you will never see what
[1:00:51] it is God wants out of you because all
[1:00:53] you'll see is I've done this and this
[1:00:55] happened I've done this and that
[1:00:57] happened but put that aside put down
[1:01:00] that I've done this and said Lord by
[1:01:02] your grace what is it that you would
[1:01:04] have me to do Lord I've done this
[1:01:07] because you asked me to do this I've
[1:01:09] gone this path because you've asked me
[1:01:10] to do this I was listening to a sermon
[1:01:13] uh last week when brother brandham gives
[1:01:15] the example of the um the woman with the
[1:01:18] picket fence and how when he walked out
[1:01:20] of that plane he just started walking
[1:01:22] just not knowing where he's going but
[1:01:24] just being obedient and listening turn
[1:01:27] this way turn that way hello Parson
[1:01:29] how'd you know I was a Parson right you
[1:01:31] start seeing like wow man I wish some of
[1:01:32] that stuff happened to me well get out
[1:01:34] of the way and it
[1:01:36] will the problem is we're in the
[1:01:40] way wh why do I got to turn there this
[1:01:42] is the ghetto this is this there's so
[1:01:44] much stuff there man I don't want to be
[1:01:45] over there I want to be where the rich
[1:01:47] are at Let Me Be Where the money's at I
[1:01:49] want I want to be over on this side but
[1:01:51] the scripture tells us that it's hard
[1:01:53] for a rich man to enter into heaven than
[1:01:56] it is for a cam to enter into eye of a
[1:01:57] needle right so sometimes what the way
[1:02:00] in which God wants us to
[1:02:02] go categorically goes against what we
[1:02:06] think just just settle that now God
[1:02:09] maybe what you would have me to do goes
[1:02:12] against what I think but if it's your
[1:02:14] will I don't have to worry about how
[1:02:16] it'll happen you said it I believe it
[1:02:19] you'll bring it to
[1:02:20] pass he's Duty bound he has
[1:02:23] to let's go to uh sermon faith in
[1:02:30] 5685 starting in paragraph
[1:02:53] 24
[1:03:01] he says why it's not what we are but
[1:03:05] what Christ is for us Christ become you
[1:03:08] and I that you and I might become him he
[1:03:12] taken our sins that we might take his
[1:03:14] righteousness so it's nothing in my arms
[1:03:17] I bring simply to thy cross I cling
[1:03:21] nothing I could do nothing you could do
[1:03:23] it's the grace of God then God tried man
[1:03:26] one time and made a covenant with man
[1:03:28] upon a condition if you not touch this
[1:03:30] tree then you'll live forever and man
[1:03:32] broke his Covenant man just can't keep
[1:03:35] his promise to
[1:03:39] God oh man his adversary is too great
[1:03:43] and God knowing that he was determined
[1:03:45] to save
[1:03:46] man stop here for a moment he said then
[1:03:50] God tried one time made a covenant with
[1:03:51] man upon a condition if you'll not touch
[1:03:54] this tree then you'll live forever and
[1:03:56] man broke his Covenant man just can't
[1:03:59] keep his promise to God his adversaries
[1:04:03] too great and you realize the very
[1:04:06] condition the devil wants you to be in
[1:04:08] is a constant promising things to God
[1:04:11] lord I promise I'm going to do this when
[1:04:12] I leave here I promise I'm going to get
[1:04:14] to it I'm finally going to go I'm going
[1:04:16] to take that TV that I have I'm going to
[1:04:18] beat it up I'm going to kick it out I
[1:04:19] will and the moment you leave and you
[1:04:21] don't do it now you feel ashamed
[1:04:24] now you feel like Lord I've disappointed
[1:04:26] you man Lord you know I've done this
[1:04:28] Lord you know I should have just
[1:04:29] listened I should have just done that
[1:04:31] the devil's so good I remember times I
[1:04:33] would be on fire here but the time I got
[1:04:35] from here to that door everything
[1:04:37] changed I went from fire to
[1:04:40] lukewarm in an instant the devil's happy
[1:04:43] with that cuz while I was there I'm
[1:04:44] making all these promises I'm going to
[1:04:45] change I'm going to be better I'm going
[1:04:47] to do this but I forgot that my
[1:04:49] adversary was too great I'm not fighting
[1:04:52] a mere man I'm fighting somebody that's
[1:04:54] got got 2,000 years of experience he
[1:04:56] knows what he's doing he knows that so
[1:04:59] long as you're making the promise like
[1:05:01] brother Matthew said this morning you
[1:05:02] have a weapon in your hand you don't
[1:05:03] know how to use it see the weapon's the
[1:05:05] word right you don't have to make a
[1:05:07] promise when you remind god of what he
[1:05:08] said then you don't have to prom you
[1:05:10] don't have to promise anything he said
[1:05:12] it it's his promise he keeps his word we
[1:05:15] don't so when you find yourself in that
[1:05:17] state where you're thinking man Lord I I
[1:05:19] I how to do this how to do say no Lord
[1:05:22] you said your prophet spoke and said if
[1:05:25] there's more if I desire more of you
[1:05:28] there's more of you to be
[1:05:30] found because you said that and this is
[1:05:33] my desire Lord bring it to pass then he
[1:05:38] moves he does it but if it's your own
[1:05:41] righteousness your own thoughts your own
[1:05:44] ideas of what you think you need to do
[1:05:47] let's not be mistaken the Devil is a
[1:05:50] worthy adversary for this time but he
[1:05:53] does not stand compared to our
[1:05:56] champion when he said it is finished it
[1:05:59] doesn't matter what condition you're in
[1:06:01] it doesn't matter what you're fighting
[1:06:03] it doesn't matter the devil's in your
[1:06:05] life it doesn't matter where you see
[1:06:07] yourself it doesn't matter if you're
[1:06:08] knocking at the door of hell and saying
[1:06:10] give way let just let me in just let me
[1:06:12] in it don't matter how far you've gone
[1:06:14] there is nothing that's gone too far
[1:06:17] when he spoken I have made thee that
[1:06:19] word saying I have made thee it's it's
[1:06:22] it's promise going forth it gets a hold
[1:06:25] of you you can't let go you're not
[1:06:27] holding on to him he's holding on to you
[1:06:30] but the devil wants you to think that
[1:06:32] you're holding on to him so every time
[1:06:33] you fall you think oh no I let go of God
[1:06:37] I got to go and pick him up I let him go
[1:06:38] no you didn't let go of God you can't
[1:06:40] let go of him you never chose him in the
[1:06:42] first place he chose you because he
[1:06:45] chose you he's Duty bound to take you
[1:06:46] from where you're at to where he wants
[1:06:48] you to be all you got to do is surrender
[1:06:50] say Lord have your way whatever it may
[1:06:52] be have your way Lord take take control
[1:06:55] Glory let it be all to you Lord
[1:07:03] Jesus I I think we we we we really are
[1:07:05] to understand like like brother Brandon
[1:07:07] would say that in this day and age that
[1:07:10] we have to understand the devil and his
[1:07:12] tactics that's part of the reason the
[1:07:14] word came so you can see how the Devil
[1:07:16] comes to you brother B would say he
[1:07:18] doesn't come to you you know with
[1:07:21] horns and uh whatever you call that fork
[1:07:25] and so forth that's not how he comes
[1:07:27] he's not red that's that's not the devil
[1:07:30] but he comes to you in a nice suit it
[1:07:33] might be blue it may not be blue
[1:07:35] whatever color it is that he comes in
[1:07:38] you got to be honest the Devil comes to
[1:07:40] you in whatever manner he knows where
[1:07:43] you're weak at he knows so if you're a
[1:07:46] fenine Believer he might send you
[1:07:49] somebody that's a little bit over that
[1:07:51] fence and then they'll start putting
[1:07:54] certain ideas in your mind well you know
[1:07:56] brother brandham wasn't on Sunset
[1:07:57] mountain when you know all that stuff
[1:08:00] that he says happened happened he was
[1:08:02] actually over here hunting you know I
[1:08:05] was this is just my understanding you
[1:08:08] know the bridge where people fell you
[1:08:10] know there was no newspaper that showed
[1:08:12] where that many people fell so I don't
[1:08:15] know you know the word says that if what
[1:08:17] a prophet says if it comes to pass then
[1:08:20] know he's a prophet if it doesn't then
[1:08:21] qu well you know he said this but I
[1:08:24] don't see proof of
[1:08:25] it where is it at and if you're not
[1:08:28] anchored you will see these
[1:08:31] things and you'll step back you'll say
[1:08:35] you know what he's right that I I don't
[1:08:38] see those people that died I don't see
[1:08:39] any mention of him anywhere you know
[1:08:41] he's right Brothers they they said they
[1:08:44] they were hunting with him when the
[1:08:45] sunset Mountain situation happened you
[1:08:47] know he's right but I've I found it
[1:08:50] funny brother Brandon would describe to
[1:08:52] us how hard his life was and how
[1:08:54] reality and divisions for him were
[1:08:58] Blended so what's it to you if he's over
[1:09:01] there but he's over there so what's it
[1:09:04] to
[1:09:05] you oh no but he physically he was here
[1:09:09] yeah I'm telling you he was here but he
[1:09:11] was physically at home as well when he
[1:09:12] told you I saw you in a vision this
[1:09:14] morning checking the thermometer of your
[1:09:15] baby and it was at this how did he see
[1:09:18] it he wasn't in your living room so how
[1:09:19] did he see it God didn't tell me to
[1:09:21] explain away the things that he did did
[1:09:24] why they said he was here and yet he
[1:09:26] says he was here if he said he's here
[1:09:28] for me that's as good as done I don't
[1:09:30] got to worry about that he didn't tell
[1:09:32] me to worry about it he just said
[1:09:37] believe it it's it it's a real danger
[1:09:41] speaking you talk about the devil being
[1:09:44] a worthy adversary who really
[1:09:46] understands who really knows where and
[1:09:49] how to get you he knows sometimes when
[1:09:52] you go to camp when you go to these
[1:09:54] powerful meetings and you get so filled
[1:09:56] up it it it put oh man you know what I'm
[1:09:58] going to go out there I'm going to beat
[1:09:59] all them Devils man any of them come big
[1:10:02] horn or not I'm chopping him off oh he's
[1:10:04] gone he's not going to in my presence
[1:10:06] he's as good as done he's finished and
[1:10:10] the littlest devil peeps his head oh
[1:10:13] that's nothing but a little cat that's
[1:10:15] just a little dog I don't have to worry
[1:10:16] about him that's just a little puppy
[1:10:18] that's just like that puppy's not going
[1:10:20] to do no harm to me but then brother Bon
[1:10:22] would describe you of the chief that
[1:10:24] said well you know I've got two dogs in
[1:10:26] me I got a black dog and I got a white
[1:10:27] dog and they wore against each other and
[1:10:29] he says well which one wins well the one
[1:10:31] Chief feeds wins so yeah that devil
[1:10:34] might be a little puppy now but you keep
[1:10:36] feeding him he'll become a big dog and
[1:10:39] you think because you cut his head off
[1:10:41] that that's it you know brother Brandon
[1:10:43] would the the scripture would say that
[1:10:45] when God delivers you and gives you
[1:10:47] Deliverance the spirits leave the house
[1:10:49] is empty now you've got to fill it if
[1:10:52] you don't fill the house then you'll get
[1:10:54] more than what you bargain for on the
[1:10:56] other side so what we need to do when we
[1:10:59] have those Services where you're spoken
[1:11:01] to where you feel it like you know what
[1:11:03] God you're speaking to me it's gone to
[1:11:05] where I'm at you've came to my seat you
[1:11:08] know often times I hear Brother bam say
[1:11:10] the spirit's over there it went to that
[1:11:11] seat she Drew him there I remember you
[1:11:14] drew him to your seat when when you feel
[1:11:17] it's like man he's preaching about me
[1:11:19] everybody knows it's me if I stand up oh
[1:11:23] done they're going to know it's me
[1:11:25] they're going to think this they're
[1:11:27] going to criticize me they're going to
[1:11:28] do this they're going to do that well
[1:11:30] I'm just going to say this I'm sorry if
[1:11:31] they criticize you they got to check
[1:11:32] their own
[1:11:34] spirit because people really need help
[1:11:37] people are really crying for something
[1:11:39] and it's the spirit of criticism right
[1:11:42] you you might be hindering them you may
[1:11:44] be the reason they don't want to come to
[1:11:46] church well if I go there they're going
[1:11:47] to look at me this going to look at me
[1:11:48] that way going to do this and if you if
[1:11:50] you're on that side of doing those
[1:11:52] things you ought to make it it right
[1:11:54] because what was it that saved you not
[1:11:57] your own
[1:11:58] merits not your own efforts not your own
[1:12:01] strength not your own ideas the very one
[1:12:04] that saved you that person that you know
[1:12:06] that's struggling and fighting they have
[1:12:08] a right to be saved by that same person
[1:12:11] so in in in instead of criticizing
[1:12:13] instead of judging instead of making fun
[1:12:16] instead of pushing them aside why not
[1:12:18] like man I I love what Matthew preached
[1:12:20] this morning be Jesus to that person you
[1:12:23] go to them you say sister I want to pray
[1:12:25] with you brother I want to pray with you
[1:12:27] let's just get down and pray we can't
[1:12:29] make it on our own we need one
[1:12:35] another it goes it continues on he
[1:12:46] says adversary was too great and God
[1:12:48] knowing that he was determined to save
[1:12:51] man so he made the Covenant
[1:12:56] unconditionally oh brother the trouble
[1:12:58] of it is with the Full Gospel people
[1:13:01] tonight you're scared that how can
[1:13:04] anything happen to you how can those who
[1:13:06] he fornew he predestinated those who he
[1:13:09] he has predestinated or forne he called
[1:13:12] those who he called he has Justified and
[1:13:14] those who he justified he had already
[1:13:17] glorified so quit being scared God's the
[1:13:20] one that's driving the ship not you and
[1:13:23] I
[1:13:24] we're just to stay on it amen God made a
[1:13:28] promise God keeps his promise no matter
[1:13:30] how ridiculous it seems God keeps it oh
[1:13:35] Hallelujah my goodness that's wonderful
[1:13:37] no matter how ridiculous it seems like
[1:13:40] the example I gave you a crippled man
[1:13:42] with no legs racing in two weeks on foot
[1:13:45] that's ridiculous but it doesn't matter
[1:13:48] how it looks he made the promis amen
[1:13:51] because he made the promise it's his job
[1:13:54] to bring it to
[1:13:55] pass and I just when I started to think
[1:13:59] about Abraham and all all that he must
[1:14:02] have been thinking the the battles the
[1:14:05] devil must have brought to him like man
[1:14:07] you're 90 years old you're you're
[1:14:10] wrinkled you're like how are you gonna
[1:14:13] how you going to have this kid but
[1:14:16] brother bham said Abraham never looked
[1:14:19] at the his condition he never looked at
[1:14:22] where he was at
[1:14:24] he just believed because God said it
[1:14:26] that God was Duty bound to do it so
[1:14:29] tonight I I challenge each and every
[1:14:32] single one of us whatever our condition
[1:14:34] is whatever condition we find ourselves
[1:14:37] the accomplishes we have in our mind the
[1:14:40] trials I don't care if you've been
[1:14:41] praying for healing for five six years
[1:14:43] and you don't see it I don't care if
[1:14:45] you've been stuck in depression stuck in
[1:14:48] anxiety what whatever the spirit is
[1:14:50] Spirit of lust pornography whatever that
[1:14:52] spirit is that's got you bound it
[1:14:54] doesn't matter how long it's had you
[1:14:56] Bound for the scripture says in in the
[1:15:00] time of life when he comes right God
[1:15:04] works things his timing is perfect it
[1:15:08] never fails so you may think you know
[1:15:11] I've done too much I've went too far
[1:15:12] I've gone too far and I I I've been
[1:15:15] there where it's like Lord I I I made my
[1:15:17] stand for you Lord I I I said I want to
[1:15:20] live for you and then I looked at myself
[1:15:22] and I'm like man how could the stand you
[1:15:25] said the stand you made look at
[1:15:28] you look at how you're
[1:15:31] living and the de the devil wants to
[1:15:33] point out it's my
[1:15:36] effort it was in my immaturity of
[1:15:39] thinking because I had that experience
[1:15:41] that that that was all that I
[1:15:43] needed there was nothing more to be done
[1:15:45] on my
[1:15:46] part oh now you know now that I got this
[1:15:49] experience I can go out I can testify
[1:15:51] and do this and do that and the third
[1:15:52] and so
[1:15:53] forth but Christ knowing all things
[1:15:58] himself said I do nothing lest the
[1:16:00] father show with me first so it doesn't
[1:16:03] matter how supercharged you are with the
[1:16:06] word and inspiration and and and hunger
[1:16:08] to do something for God there's a season
[1:16:11] and a time for
[1:16:13] everything so what we need is to take
[1:16:16] that condition that we have place it in
[1:16:19] the word and said Lord you made an
[1:16:22] uncondition
[1:16:23] Covenant with
[1:16:28] me why are we
[1:16:32] scared why are we
[1:16:37] scared is does the condition seem too
[1:16:41] great do we think it's too impossible
[1:16:43] for God to do it's gone on too
[1:16:48] long we tried our
[1:16:51] best we gave our best
[1:16:54] effort Lord I've done all that I can
[1:16:58] Lord you know I've given it
[1:17:00] everything all my efforts father I've
[1:17:03] done it
[1:17:05] all that's
[1:17:07] good keep going no Lord you don't
[1:17:10] understand I've I've literally done all
[1:17:12] that I can do like there's nothing more
[1:17:13] I can
[1:17:15] do keep going you're not there
[1:17:18] yet Lord I I'm you I have no other
[1:17:21] effort to give
[1:17:23] keep going you're not there
[1:17:26] yet you see the thinking I've done all
[1:17:30] that I can do Moses had to learn that
[1:17:34] lesson he knew what was promised of him
[1:17:36] and he tried it on his own but God
[1:17:39] didn't use him until he really couldn't
[1:17:41] do
[1:17:42] nothing so maybe where God's trying to
[1:17:45] take you is he's got to break you so
[1:17:48] much to a point that you realize you
[1:17:50] know what Ben your effort are for
[1:17:54] not you can't do
[1:17:56] it when you get there then you say Lord
[1:18:00] my strength is done I have need of thee
[1:18:03] you be my
[1:18:04] strength you be the one that does it I
[1:18:08] yield myself have your way father
[1:18:11] whatever that way is Lord father I've
[1:18:13] tried it my way I've tried it the best I
[1:18:16] can it hasn't worked so Lord what's your
[1:18:20] will that's where God wants to get each
[1:18:23] and every single one of us to that point
[1:18:27] where we say Lord have your way when you
[1:18:29] get there that name change will
[1:18:31] happen you'll go from Abram to
[1:18:35] Abraham sinner
[1:18:38] bride he'll be the one that does it
[1:18:41] remember he gave him the promise when he
[1:18:43] was 75 I believe and 25 years he visited
[1:18:48] him periodically during that
[1:18:51] time just watching
[1:18:54] they probably had more faith that it
[1:18:56] would happen or you would think they had
[1:18:58] more faith that it would happen when
[1:19:00] they were 75 a little bit younger still
[1:19:02] old but a little bit
[1:19:04] younger but I I dare to believe that
[1:19:07] when Abraham got to 99 he had more faith
[1:19:10] that it would happen because as the
[1:19:12] condition got worse and worse and worse
[1:19:15] and it seemed so
[1:19:16] impossible God said this man here he's
[1:19:20] not wavering let it let if it was a 100
[1:19:23] years wait he's not wavering his faith
[1:19:26] is just going to keep growing and
[1:19:28] growing and growing and growing and
[1:19:29] growing I wonder if we look at our
[1:19:31] trials that way come on man I've been
[1:19:33] fighting for 10 years I've been fighting
[1:19:35] for soul I'm fighting for this yeah you
[1:19:38] have but that miracle that Supernatural
[1:19:41] event that's about to take place it'll
[1:19:43] be more of a testimony the fact that
[1:19:46] you've waited so long for this than it
[1:19:48] would have been if it was given to you
[1:19:50] like that what's he teaching you
[1:19:52] patience wait wait wait Lord I don't
[1:19:56] understand I've I've I've waited long
[1:19:58] enough as long as I think I can wait no
[1:20:01] no no you're stronger than you
[1:20:04] think he wants to pull characteristics
[1:20:07] out of you and his way of doing that is
[1:20:09] by trials yes so your condition is
[1:20:13] nothing more than God showing you where
[1:20:17] you need
[1:20:18] him no matter the condition he's just
[1:20:21] trying to show you where you need
[1:20:24] him he he wants to get you to completely
[1:20:28] trust and surrender everything you've
[1:20:30] got to him there's really nothing that I
[1:20:34] can
[1:20:37] do I get the chance sometimes to see
[1:20:41] some of the stuff that Matthew Billy and
[1:20:44] Brother David go through when they have
[1:20:45] to get back here and preach you would
[1:20:48] think they had this great big servant
[1:20:53] but they had one
[1:20:55] word you talk about a
[1:20:57] surrender and letting God speak through
[1:21:01] you every single one of us you don't
[1:21:04] have to be here to have that same
[1:21:05] surrender God gave you one word
[1:21:09] bride in that word is all you
[1:21:12] need it's his
[1:21:15] job his job to Quicken that to you that
[1:21:18] you realize no it's it's not just the
[1:21:19] passing phrase bride no but I really am
[1:21:21] the Bride of Jesus
[1:21:23] Christ I am him though I can't see it
[1:21:26] now but he said it and I can rest assur
[1:21:30] knowing the fact that he said it he'll
[1:21:33] bring me to it where I can see it
[1:21:37] manifested if the musicians will come I
[1:21:40] want to read to
[1:21:43] you just in in closing scripture in
[1:21:50] Psalms I believe it's
[1:22:21] 139
[1:22:25] and put put yourself in the
[1:22:28] scripture oh Lord thou has searched me
[1:22:32] and known me thou knowest my downsitting
[1:22:36] and my Uprising thou understandest my
[1:22:38] thought a far off thou compassest my
[1:22:42] path and my lying down and are
[1:22:43] acquainted with all my ways for there is
[1:22:46] not a word in my tongue but lo oh Lord
[1:22:48] thou knowest it all together thou has
[1:22:51] beset me behind and for and laid thine
[1:22:53] hand upon me such knowledge is too
[1:22:56] wonderful for me it is too high I cannot
[1:22:59] attain unto it whether shall I go from
[1:23:02] thy Spirit or shall I flee from thy
[1:23:05] presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou
[1:23:07] Art there if I make my bed in hell
[1:23:10] behold thou are there if I take the
[1:23:13] wings of morning and dwell in the
[1:23:14] uttermost parts of the sea even there
[1:23:17] shall thy hand lead me and thy right
[1:23:19] hand shall hold me if I say surely the
[1:23:22] dark shall come over even the night
[1:23:24] shall be light about me yay the darkness
[1:23:27] hideth not from thee but the night
[1:23:29] shineth as the day the darkness and the
[1:23:31] light are both alike to thee for though
[1:23:34] thou has possessed my Reigns thou has
[1:23:36] covered me in my mother's womb I will
[1:23:39] praise thee for I am fearfully and
[1:23:40] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:23:44] and that my soul knoweth right well my
[1:23:47] substance was not hid from thee when I
[1:23:49] was made in secret and curiously wrought
[1:23:51] in the lowest parts of the earth Thine
[1:23:54] Eyes did see my substance yet being
[1:23:57] unperfect and in the book all my members
[1:24:00] were written which in continuance were
[1:24:03] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:24:06] them how precious also are they are thy
[1:24:10] thoughts unto me oh God how great is the
[1:24:13] sum of them if I should count them they
[1:24:15] are more in number than the sand when I
[1:24:18] awake I am still with
[1:24:21] thee
[1:24:23] so
[1:24:25] tonight I I challenge
[1:24:29] you especially what what you heard this
[1:24:33] morning and how the Lord's dealt with
[1:24:35] you in this
[1:24:37] service if you find
[1:24:40] yourself
[1:24:41] unsatisfied it's it's it's it's it
[1:24:44] doesn't have to be that you're in a sin
[1:24:48] condition but if it's just you feel like
[1:24:51] you're stagnant in your walk with
[1:24:54] God you're not really going anywhere
[1:24:57] you're not sinning but you also feel
[1:24:59] like you know there's there's more I
[1:25:01] feel like I got to break more ground
[1:25:03] whatever the condition is whatever the
[1:25:06] condition
[1:25:07] is understand that God
[1:25:10] promised that whatever you desire there
[1:25:12] is there for you if it's more of God
[1:25:16] it's there if it's healing it's there if
[1:25:19] it's Deliverance it's there amen
[1:25:22] whatever it is that you have need of and
[1:25:25] if you happen to be in that place I I've
[1:25:27] been there so I I can really
[1:25:30] sympathize where you you don't like what
[1:25:33] you see in the
[1:25:34] mirror you hate every part of it you say
[1:25:38] this man is going to send me to
[1:25:40] hell if I keep listening to this man
[1:25:44] he's going to send me to hell if you
[1:25:45] find yourself in that place and you
[1:25:48] don't know how to you
[1:25:50] know I try I I really do try my best but
[1:25:55] it's just not good enough if you find
[1:25:58] yourself there just in your seat you
[1:26:01] don't have to come to the altar in your
[1:26:03] seat be real with
[1:26:06] God show him yourself he knows your
[1:26:10] condition it's not a surprise to him he
[1:26:12] knows but he wants you to confess
[1:26:15] it and you ask him to come where you're
[1:26:17] at in your seat and you say Lord you
[1:26:21] spoke spoken over
[1:26:24] me and I don't know how you're going to
[1:26:26] do it I don't know when you'll do it but
[1:26:30] I just know I refuse to leave this
[1:26:32] building the same way I
[1:26:34] came if you truly have that desire in
[1:26:37] your heart and that's truly what you
[1:26:39] want I believe without a shadow of doubt
[1:26:42] before you leave that building you'll
[1:26:44] leave with something real but if you
[1:26:46] push it off and you say I know my
[1:26:49] condition's bad but I think I can manage
[1:26:51] to get out of it
[1:26:54] you
[1:26:55] can't you can't that's where the devil
[1:26:57] wants you he wants you to think you can
[1:27:00] get out of it but you
[1:27:03] you you
[1:27:07] can't I don't know if if if any of you
[1:27:09] have ever had an addiction to
[1:27:12] something I got a
[1:27:18] neighbor who's been like family to me
[1:27:22] addicted to
[1:27:24] smoking since I was in Middle School
[1:27:27] took me out all my practices took me to
[1:27:30] paid for so many different things helped
[1:27:32] my family a lot
[1:27:33] and she was always honest with me she
[1:27:37] would tell me all the time Ben I don't
[1:27:39] want to smoke I really don't I hate it
[1:27:44] but I can't
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:49] stop that breaks my heart
[1:27:53] she wants it so
[1:27:55] bad so bad I pray for
[1:28:00] her give her words of
[1:28:04] encouragement you don't have to
[1:28:06] stop he'll stop
[1:28:10] it by all means keep
[1:28:13] going you just keep feeding and you
[1:28:18] watch he's going to take a hold of
[1:28:20] that and he'll remove it out of your
[1:28:24] life and now she's she's got cancer and
[1:28:29] and so forth and she she telling me says
[1:28:31] you know Ben I I deserve
[1:28:34] this I knew what I was doing and the
[1:28:37] consequences of
[1:28:39] it I wonder if we don't have spiritual
[1:28:41] cancers of our own that we
[1:28:44] know that we fed and it's gotten to the
[1:28:47] place that it's gotten to because we fed
[1:28:51] it
[1:28:52] and now we're at
[1:28:53] the physician's house saying oh great
[1:28:58] physician you see the condition I've put
[1:29:01] myself
[1:29:03] in you see what I've done this is you
[1:29:06] didn't do this Lord I I put myself
[1:29:09] here but Lord I need you to get me
[1:29:13] out you know I I I didn't I didn't get
[1:29:15] the chance to read it but brother
[1:29:16] brandham says in that sermon Israel in
[1:29:18] the church that God doesn't turn away
[1:29:21] anybody that comes to
[1:29:23] him so if you find yourself in that
[1:29:26] condition he won't turn you
[1:29:29] away he never has and he never
[1:29:31] will anybody that comes to him he
[1:29:35] doesn't turn
[1:29:39] away brother Billy if you could
[1:29:42] come just bow our heads in
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:48] prayer Heavenly
[1:29:50] Father
[1:29:54] Lord in all honesty I preach to myself
[1:29:56] Lord
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:01] Jesus but father
[1:30:04] if by your wonderful Grace

[1:30:12] themselves in in a condition that they
[1:30:14] don't like Lord
[1:30:16] Jesus they don't have to stay that
[1:30:19] way father you made a way Lord Jesus
[1:30:23] a provided way
[1:30:26] Lord you told us that if we would just
[1:30:28] surrender it to you father you would
[1:30:31] take control of it Lord Jesus the
[1:30:34] devil's a lie Lord he's nothing but a
[1:30:39] bluff that thing that's holding you and
[1:30:41] hold for so long it's not as strong as
[1:30:45] you
[1:30:46] think it's only strong because we're the
[1:30:49] ones fighting Lord
[1:30:52] but father if we just surrendered it to
[1:30:54] you Lord
[1:30:55] Jesus father what could stand before you

[1:31:51] people people Lord
[1:31:53] Jesus help them Lord Jesus help us
[1:31:56] father to Look to You

[1:38:58] never
[1:39:00] Hallelujah did you enjoy the word of God
[1:39:03] Amen regardless of
[1:39:06] conditions Oh I thought it went so well
[1:39:08] with what was preached this morning
[1:39:10] regardless of condition you know the
[1:39:13] Devil comes and you're not good enough
[1:39:15] for the promise and you did this you did
[1:39:17] that the promise was made for all that
[1:39:20] would believe believe regardless I was
[1:39:23] thinking as our brother was speaking
[1:39:25] Yeah is Abraham given a pro a promise at
[1:39:27] 75 and not until a 100 what was that
[1:39:31] period of
[1:39:33] time what was it and if you go read your
[1:39:36] Bible you'll see that he tried all kinds
[1:39:38] of stuff he did this he lied over here
[1:39:41] did God was waiting until he's
[1:39:43] completely dead to his own ideas he let
[1:39:47] him try whatever he wanted he let him
[1:39:49] it's not until he was complete in fact I
[1:39:52] would even it was in the natural until
[1:39:55] he knew that even in the natural there
[1:39:57] was no
[1:40:00] chance right then God comes and he
[1:40:04] said I am here to give you life it's
[1:40:07] according to the time of life now
[1:40:09] remember when you read the text it said
[1:40:12] I have made the this is not Abraham's
[1:40:15] life this is the life of God in Abraham
[1:40:18] so he God didn't want the life of
[1:40:20] Abraham to be mix with God's life
[1:40:22] because he was going to say oh I have a
[1:40:24] part to play with it God don't want us
[1:40:26] to have a part to play with it he wants
[1:40:29] us to believe he wants us to die to
[1:40:32] ourselves he wants us to completely
[1:40:34] surrender as our bir was just
[1:40:37] emphasizing the promise is made when God
[1:40:40] made the promise he didn't take into
[1:40:43] consideration oh well what if this
[1:40:45] particular case comes up what am I going
[1:40:48] to
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:40:49] do it was all taken care of it was all
[1:40:54] part of the promise whatever situation
[1:40:56] shows up my promise will remain true
[1:40:59] when God gives you his word is a
[1:41:01] complete product it's it's it's done
[1:41:05] it's sealed it's completed it's going to
[1:41:08] manifest itself in the time that he
[1:41:10] wants it to manifest we're the one
[1:41:13] that's fighting with ourselves we we
[1:41:15] have our ups and we have our down and
[1:41:18] today we think we have we are in we
[1:41:20] inherit the promise and tomorrow we
[1:41:22] think we lost it that's all part of the
[1:41:25] human nature of the human and what with
[1:41:28] what our brother was saying is we need
[1:41:29] to overcome that by by moving from just
[1:41:32] being a human and enter into this level
[1:41:36] into this atmosphere where God is
[1:41:38] calling us by his Spirit to understand
[1:41:40] that when he's giving you the promise
[1:41:42] the promise will remain forever he
[1:41:44] didn't say I'll give it to you and then
[1:41:46] I'll take it back no I have done this
[1:41:51] oh he talked about the power of the
[1:41:53] promise and and this is perhaps one of
[1:41:56] the very promise that you know when I
[1:41:59] every time I read the message I just
[1:42:01] never can help myself with but when I'm
[1:42:04] asked the question he said how did Jesus
[1:42:06] come he said it was by A Promise by the
[1:42:10] words of a prophet he said a son shall
[1:42:13] be born he will be given unto you he
[1:42:16] will come and he will save the people
[1:42:18] from their sin how is the bride going to
[1:42:20] come
[1:42:21] by the words of a
[1:42:23] prophet well if God spoke through the
[1:42:26] words of a prophet and Jesus came and he
[1:42:29] died and he resurrected and did all of
[1:42:31] those things the same God by the words
[1:42:33] of a prophet can't bring a brighter amen
[1:42:37] he'll do the same he the same yesterday
[1:42:39] today and forever I like that example of
[1:42:42] the woman in Memphis because I thought
[1:42:43] it just goes so well together with what
[1:42:45] was spoken this morning she saw the
[1:42:48] parallel in the Bible I was was Barren
[1:42:52] that's what the scripture says this
[1:42:53] woman was I had trouble having kids she
[1:42:56] was the
[1:42:58] same and she looked at it she followed
[1:43:01] she said this is the parallel now I need
[1:43:04] the Paradox she went and waited on the
[1:43:07] fence for the Paradox to come by
[1:43:09] away
[1:43:11] right isn't that what the prophet told
[1:43:13] us whatever your situation is go take
[1:43:16] the Bible find a matching characteristic
[1:43:21] you find it you say this is me yes I
[1:43:25] don't care if it's
[1:43:27] job I mean I'm talking extreme now this
[1:43:30] is me oh I can you know when everything
[1:43:33] is going well it's it's it's it's you
[1:43:36] want you can't understand the Book of
[1:43:38] Job absolutely not I mean you can read
[1:43:40] it as a story but it's when things are
[1:43:42] not going well that you start to see the
[1:43:45] parallels right oh wow oh wow now I can
[1:43:49] see this and then you take it you say
[1:43:52] God I I see the parallel in this now I'm
[1:43:56] waiting for you to come and take me from
[1:43:59] what I am and use the Paradox so you can
[1:44:02] bring the word out of me we don't we
[1:44:05] don't make ourselves believer he makes
[1:44:07] us Believers we don't save ourselves
[1:44:10] from our sins he saves us from our sins
[1:44:13] we don't heal ourselves he heals us and
[1:44:16] all he ask us to do is believe it's not
[1:44:19] to look it upon one another some small
[1:44:21] some big no we are all one people
[1:44:24] purchased by one
[1:44:26] blood when we see someone struggling we
[1:44:29] help them we go after them we do because
[1:44:32] we understand it was by the grace that
[1:44:34] was extended to us that's why it
[1:44:36] happened you want the same Grace to be
[1:44:38] extended to
[1:44:40] another oh I pray this tonight if we
[1:44:43] could just come
[1:44:45] in understand that the same God is here
[1:44:47] to make his promise true he's the one
[1:44:50] who make made the promise and he's going
