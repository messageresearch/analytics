[Music] foreign [Music] let's go to the worthy one tonight oh gracious Heavenly Father how we exalt you lord lord we give you the praise and the Adoration that's do your name father we don't want to just sit in the outer Court Lord we don't want to just enjoy your goodness and the outpouring of your presence that we feel here father but there's something calling and drawing us Lord into the holy of holies Lord Place only your bride can go father into that inner chamber and Lord we want to give you the Adoration let's do your name father we want to commune with you tonight as we've gathered together around your word and Lord It's a provided place a fellowship you've made lord it's not of man it's nothing that we could have done and Lord we don't look to our works or anything that we would esteem Lord but we look to you and the lamb and we exalt you and say you're the worthy one and we want to thank you for this time of Fellowship that we have and father we ask that you would now just have complete control that you'd moved me out of the way Lord may you Minister life to your people father Lord the words of man will fill but your words cannot fill Lord there's a specific purpose there's something specific you want done father we want to yield to that and ask that you would have your way father the praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask these things amen if you have your Bibles let's turn in Deuteronomy 4. read a portion of scripture I've really enjoyed the the word and the fellowship we've had just incredible uh services and brother Paul and our pastor this morning and something just struck my heart in the fellowship with around that we want to talk about and we'll take a text and move into that Deuteronomy 4 now therefore hearken o Israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the Lord God your fathers giveth you you shall not add unto the word which I command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God which I command you you may be seated just ask the Lord to bless the portion of word we've read what's on our heart is is uh just struck us this morning of the influence that we should be under that deep that should be calling us that Heavenly image that we're called to to manifest and God's provided place of doing that there's only one channel under which we can represent the Heavenly image he has of us and that has been provided in the message of this day that pattern was laid in Deuteronomy where Moses having given the Commandments to the children of Israel is telling them I this is a how you will possess the land do not deviate from it and there's a specific instruction I think here it's profound he says to not diminish it and if there's a day of diminishing the prophet's message we're living in it now it's because there's the the spirit has been poured out there's been Revelation there's been inspiration and men now have moved into that brother Branham the biggest problem he had with Pentecost is they would do things inspired with the outpouring of the spirit and deny the word of God so much of the teaching that we see is the admonishment of how the outpouring of the spirit could be there but yet there would be in air and contrary to the word of God let's not use the that admonishment to somehow diminish the necessity of the outpouring of the spirit because the while the cocklebur lives off the same Reign the wheat can't survive without it either so the the admonishment stays the same but the blessing is mine if it I'm not going to for some reason have the attitude of well bless God they're dancing in the spirit with bobbed hair with makeup or with whatever it is I mean you know that's just an obvious example of a trespass of the word of God but whatever it is you don't let that steal your joy I mean it's a very simple thing if if for some reason you let hypocrisy keep you from having a blessing from God then somehow you've put the hypocrite closer to God than you are move past that you know it press press in there's a provided place and we rejoice in that our Comfort is we are in the position that this message has placed Us in we are abiding in the word of God so then we can have a righteous partaking of Every Blessing of it I it's uh it's just a tactic of the enemy he he's a tactician anything he could do to rob you of a blessing of God he's going to use condemnation he's going to use uh a logic but we're not we don't have to listen to that we can cast down reasonings turn over and you could follow this I think another example of just knowing in the place of abiding knowing where you're supposed to be to receive a blessing I I love the story of Ruth I think if if you could you know find inspiration and just lean to something if you want to read something go read the book of Ruth but in chapter two I'm just going to read through it we know the story but there's a instruction that from that Boaz gives and I just want to read the the context of it and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husband a mighty man of wealth of the family and the name was Boaz and Ruth the mobitis said and date Naomi Let Me Now go to the field in glean Airs of corn after him and whose sight I shall find Grace and she said unto her go my daughter and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers and her hap was light a part of the field belonging unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of eliminate and behold Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered the Lord bless thee and he said then said Boaz unto the servant that was set over the Reapers whose damsel is this and the servants that was said over the Reapers answered and said it is the Moab damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country at Moab and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the sheaves so that she came and hath continued even from the morning and until now and she tarried a little in the house then said Boaz unto Ruth Hearst thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go after the young men that they shall not touch thee pardon he said let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go Thou after them have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art a thirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing I am a stranger and Boaz answered and said under it hath fully been showed unto me what thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou Hast left thy father thy mother and thy land of thy Nativity and thou Hast come a people which thou knowest not hereafter the Lord recompense thy Work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art come to trust the wings that we're trusting in is a Malachi 4 5 message as a Revelations 10 7 message if we abide there and we trust the word will absolutely perform everything that it's been sent to do there's not another field there shouldn't be anything else drawing us and I know this is Elementary but there's a blessing that's ours that when the spirit of God comes in its move and it's here now and the outpouring of the Lord comes in fathomless Billows you have to know where you're standing because it's in that move that fanaticism happens it's in that move and I believe we're standing where the Lord wants us to be but you have to know where you're established don't leave the field as soon as you leave the field you lose your blessing and and that all these examples that are given to us there's so many but why would they be given why would they have to stand there because man is always drawn after the inspiration after the Leaning of it and they've readily forget why how could they even had a place don't leave your place of blessing and even how you enter in and possess the Promised Land Is by The Commandments there there's uh you know litmus test to certain things standards the checkup of the word the Deep calling to the Deep we should always be being challenged we should not be arresting a sign of a Son of God is is not that you set in the blessing but there has to be a challenge that comes and hits the heart and says but more of you Lord more of you God's Prophet it you he never rested he there was always an expression of I don't want to stop I want to go into all the blessings that God has for me and the thing that I want to maybe just share and maybe it's a another way of looking at it maybe even for the kids going back to school is that deep calling is an influence a desire to express a Heavenly image and there's always going to be a cry for manifestation of other voices and you're giving voice and there's an influence that you're under and the discernment to understand what is influencing me even now in this moment what is the influence and what is it Desiring to manifest in my life because there's one thing certain whatever you're influenced by is going to be an influence that you have on other people and and that's that's a blessing or a curse you are a little Messiah you could create an atmosphere you you could say you know what if a terror is rejoicing you say give me my blessing yeah where's where's my portion you know so you could actually be influenced by someone entering into a blessing and they may not even be seed but you have to have enough wherewithal to understand that's a genuine outpouring that's a genuine Spirit the waters being troubled you press into that because you need it for maturity you you don't run off into fanaticism but there's no place the blessing was taken out I mean the instruction and the wisdom of knowing to not go off in air because the presence of the Lord is being poured out on make Believers and unbelievers didn't mean that the believer can't enter into the blessing I mean Shake yourself because you can't live without the water it the maturing of the seed requires the outpouring of the spirit it's all in season but just as the church we're not all in the same season I mean there's there's babes that some of us got a lot of green in us and we need to sit in the presence of the Sun and be matured we need to be baked and there needs to be a men being men and and but and there's but there's also sincere milk and and there really isn't the time that we should have to be giving sincere milk but if you need an outpouring of the Lord to mature in Christ pray the Lord will bless you but be rooted and established in the word of God so that you don't have to uh in the absence of it when it doesn't feel like there's anything there's a deep there's a faith that can call the things that are as though they are not that can say on Earth as it is in heaven because we're we're calling for heaven we have a kingdom that we're Desiring to manifest the righteousness where there's a humility where the chairmans have to cover their feet holy holy holy what is our life declaring what is the influence we're declaring and there's you're a vessel you're dependent on uh being filled and if you're not filled up with the spirit of God something some influence is going to fill you there there has to be a consciousness of a keeping your mind stayed on the Lord abiding in him and if you can't keep your thoughts there's an inspiration and a spirit to grab you a good one the Holy Spirit can grab you and inspire you around the things of God and keep your mind stayed on him doesn't have to be dry academic you know like you're trying to recite a Psalm and you know that's good but let the inspiration let the life of it he the it's where the word is the spirit is there to brood out over it it's a principle of God you've put the word before you in the presence of God is going to come and Quicken that word to life and it it's it's beautiful because even the Earth in the way it was formed was always that the Holy Spirit had to brood out over and the Glorious thing is is there should be no question that we where we are at is in God's provided place where and where he brought his word it is where the carcass is the Eagles are gathered we've received the message for our day the word of God thoroughly Vindicated and it is our portion to have that revelation it is our portion to be stimulated when we approach the communion table we're Desiring Revelation that what the wine represents we're going to receive by the word of this hour we're going to receive a inspiration revelation of God to the bride to the individual but be aware of the voices you know as as you're going back to school as you're in the workplace discern what the intent of that influence what it was it meant for and that'll help you understand whether or not you should receive it I had there's an order to Blessing by staying under the headship and the blessing of your parents when you obey them there's a blessing in it um I we were at uh in and out and um I was trying to show something on my cell phone and the Young Brother was like not going to look at it I'm like well it's just this statistic here you know this is the way this app works and it's really cool why don't you look at he's like no not looking at it I'm like why well my parents said I shouldn't be looking at the cell phones of other people and you know what there's a blessing in that I think of the wisdom and the instruction that was in that and you may not understand something but if you're obedient to it there's a blessing in it but when the inspiration strikes be faithful be faithful and little and when the he sees that and the blessings on its way because you put the word of God first you put it in your heart but there's a blessing coming the rain is going to be poured out upon it amen the uh the admonishment and there's a lot to it but I want to just bring this home and it may be the more mature portion to it but I do believe that in this day we've been given to eat meat and uh just ask the Lord to bless this portion of it but it's in the trying to do God as service without it being its will brother Brandon would lay out these principles of how the presence of God is outpoured and how David was even inspired and he had a revelation and I just want to to share this because it's an instruction to us as men of God as children of God that we should be um always willing to check up with this message and not think more of ourselves than we ought and if you can't do that you know the Zeal of this age is to repent and if it's not in you to repent then you're not his child so the word is meant to divide um but I believe we're all the children of God here and we're not lifting up our own personal Revelations our own personal inspiration beyond what the prophet of this hour brought but um there's a portion that has to be said to those things trying to find a place to start on this but now is the bride calling now is when the Seven Seals has been open now when we compare things that the reformers left has to be opened and only Malachi 4 can do that because it takes the Revelation straight from God to an individual to do so that's right it came it can't come to a group never did one man that's what God promised in the shadows of the coming of his bride and Eliezer notice when the priest ministers and so forth get their own inspiration and truly anointed David was anointed the Bible said so but you see he went through the wrong resource he went to the wrong Channel he channeled his anointing in the wrong side to the people and what they thought to the captains what they thought instead of God's holy channel to find out what thus saith the Lord was is this the time for this is this the season for this is this the will of God then if he's a true prophet of God he'll go before God first say father what is it like Nathan did later on to David and look as Nathan said David do all that's in your heart for God is with you your anointed vessel of God and I think we can all qualify we're anointed vessels of God you are vessels I mean even we'll we'll leave it on the vessels of Honor but one way or another you're an anointed vessel then came Nathan with thus saith the Lord David the great Revelation you had is wrong as it was when you brought up the ark uh oh see don't you do it don't try it but God said he'll have your son do it there there you are and David was a man after God's Own Heart and it is an encouragement as we approach the communion table if you're inspired there's one thing that God will be faithful to as as the son of God if you've been with a good heart and a good intent and you've tried to go forward in the Lord the word will come and correct you if you're an heir he's faithful to that the Zeal is to repent and so he he hasn't left you he hasn't forsaken you it's but I'll tell you one thing if there was air in my heart and it was only going to manifest what if I was anointed Lord anoint me so I could repent so the air could be made manifest so I could be quick and have a Zeal and say Lord take this from me but sit and dry you ain't gonna Bloom you ain't in a Bud you're just gonna sit there and not have the presence of the Lord move upon you no let's let the Lord have his way let him manifest what's in our heart because as a Son of God he's going to prune he's going to he's going to shape you he's going to make sure you bring forth more fruit and it's going to be to his glory but um don't think just because the presence of the Lord was outpoured I I would even say this when the Lord moves as a Son of God I think there's always a challenge to come up higher always there's no way you come into the presence of a righteous God and not have a desire to be more like him and that's because there's a seed in there crying for manifestation and that's the mark of a believer so I just encourage your hearts as you you know seek Revelation but it has to be according to God's Channel it has to be according to God's provided way humble yourselves before God he'll exalt you the admonishment that comes later on in Deuteronomy I'm going to just read that because it don't want to leave this off it's a same chapter 4 and verse 24 he says for the Lord God is a consuming fire even a jealous God you know that jealousy often is put in a in a very negative connotation and especially in modern society the things that it provokes the thing but God's a jealous God he desire he wants you to himself and not another he doesn't want you in another field he doesn't want you seeking after uh other following letting diminishing his Commandments but he's a he's a jealous God when thou shalt beget children and children's children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make graven images or the likeness of anything and shall do evil in the sight of the Lord thy God to provoke him to anger I call on Heaven and Earth to witness to you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land wherein to ye go over to Jordan to possess it you shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed there's the warning there's the judgment and where does it come it comes after a sojourning it comes after there's a begetting of children and we're to the point where we being raised in the message we're being raised in a beautiful land a Promised Land a provided place and that is when it would behoove you to not start to diminish the Commandments okay call it a clothesline gospel if you want don't diminish the Commandments we don't need to go through them but if you notice they're diminishing you're about to lose your blessing but this is the this is the grace but if this isn't 29 but if from thence Thou shalt seek the Lord thy God Thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thine heart and one follow thy soul when that art in Tribulation and all these things are come upon me even under the latter days if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shalt be obedient unto his voice for the Lord thy God is merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the Covenant of thy fathers which he swear unto them that provided places this message we're resting under those wings you all and we should be so thankful for that God bless you what a beautiful thought in not diminishing the word of God and even in our communion scriptures that Matthew will read for us he says happy are you if you do these things amen amen so what a what a wonderful thing we certainly need the spirit of the Lord don't we in fact he's that's why he sent the Holy Spirit I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come unto you again amen and bring in the spirit brings us into remembrance of all the things that he taught us amen you you can't have the word quick into you without the spirit amen what a what must be in the presence of the Lord amen and and I like that you know when somebody's blessed and worshiping God don't sit back and try to discern it get right in there yourself amen Worship the Lord amen God bless you because let's stand together and turn in our our scriptures in Corinthians and and have brother Matthew come read our communion if the brothers would go prepare for communion at this time it'd be wonderful God bless you brother
