[26:40] um
[26:42] it's been uh it's been over probably a
[26:44] year where
[26:47] i'm experiencing a
[26:49] back ache whenever i wake up in the
[26:51] morning i
[26:54] i always
[26:58] having trouble going up and going to
[27:00] work
[27:04] of course the only thing we can do is to
[27:06] pray and
[27:07] hope that god will
[27:09] finally heal you and
[27:11] give the healing touch you need
[27:16] probably two
[27:17] two to three months back
[27:19] during a service
[27:24] i went and go to the restroom and
[27:28] of course take a pee and
[27:30] blood came out
[27:34] i don't know what's happening and
[27:36] of course
[27:37] if it's your time it's your time but i
[27:39] said lord i know you're the same
[27:41] yesterday today forever and
[27:47] you did it in most of the
[27:51] brother and sister who believe in you
[27:53] and i believe in you that's all i can do
[27:55] and
[27:58] i know brother darian is asking me to
[27:59] pray for it and i ask brother it cost me
[28:01] to pray for me on that day and some of
[28:03] the brothers and some of the deacons

[28:34] medicine i
[28:35] i felt something heat in my body and
[28:38] i didn't i didn't i didn't take the
[28:40] medicine but
[28:42] and i went directly to the restroom and
[28:44] there you go a

[28:50] three to four or five centimeter of
[28:52] stone came out

[42:46] lord i know many times as we
[42:50] press the battle and we
[42:52] come to our post of duty
[42:54] [Music]
[42:56] many times the rigor of the battle
[43:00] weighs upon us and
[43:02] sometimes we show up and don't even have
[43:05] expectations and
[43:08] that's sometimes just part of putting
[43:10] one foot in front of the other
[43:13] but lord we made it here
[43:15] and now the songs of zion have been sung
[43:18] and
[43:19] your presence is amongst us lord
[43:23] pray that our heart could start to turn
[43:25] lord and to
[43:27] open up to know that
[43:29] you have more that you'd like to say to
[43:31] us
[43:32] lord we rejoice in the word that we
[43:34] heard this morning
[43:36] how it
[43:38] thrills our soul lord to know that we
[43:40] were with you before the world
[43:43] was ever formed
[43:44] what a victory that revelation gives the
[43:46] believer to know that nothing can stop
[43:48] us
[43:50] in this journey
[43:52] now lord as we're here this evening we
[43:54] commit ourselves to you
[43:56] father pray that you'd come and break
[43:57] the bread of life as only you can bless
[43:59] your people now we pray in jesus
[44:01] christ's name we ask it
[44:03] amen praise the lord if you have your
[44:05] bibles we'll be reading out of mark
[44:06] chapter 11.
[44:14] amen
[44:16] i sure enjoyed the service this morning
[44:19] what a what a service you can certainly
[44:22] have victory and rejoice in
[44:28] mark 11 verse
[44:30] verse 20 is where we'd like to start
[44:32] reading
[44:35] mark 11
[44:38] verse 20 would read and in the morning
[44:40] as they passed by they saw the fig tree
[44:43] dried up from the roots
[44:47] and peter calling to remember it saith
[44:49] unto him master behold the fig tree
[44:52] which thou curseth
[44:54] is withered away
[44:56] and jesus answered it and said unto him
[44:59] have faith in god
[45:01] for verily i say unto you that
[45:03] whatsoever shall whosoever shall say
[45:05] into this mountain be thou removed
[45:08] and be thou cast in the sea and shall
[45:09] not doubt in his heart
[45:11] but shall believe that those things
[45:14] which he saith shall come to pass
[45:16] he shall have whatsoever
[45:18] he saith
[45:20] therefore i say unto you whatsoever
[45:22] things you desire when you pray believe
[45:24] that you receive them
[45:26] and ye shall have them and when you
[45:28] stand praying forgive
[45:31] if you have ought against any that your
[45:33] father also which is in heaven may
[45:35] forgive your
[45:36] trespasses amen you may be seated
[45:40] and we just want to start to
[45:43] we pulling from this
[45:45] text here as brother branham would use
[45:47] this
[45:48] mark 11
[45:50] verse 20 he would preach
[45:52] perfect faith
[45:54] and also he would preach i believe he
[45:56] preached perfect faith there in august
[45:58] 63 and then in november
[46:01] he would preach he that is in you and
[46:03] use this text as well but i just want to
[46:05] bring your attention to to how jesus is
[46:08] saying here in the scripture he says
[46:10] that whosoever shall say to this
[46:12] mountain and notice what he says that he
[46:15] says and shall not doubt in his heart so
[46:18] he's speaking to the individual that
[46:20] whosoever shall say to this mouth and be
[46:22] thou removed and be thou cast in the sea
[46:24] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[46:27] shall believe those things which he
[46:29] saith
[46:30] so then he's pointing this is something
[46:32] the individual's doing
[46:34] this is something that the believer he
[46:36] is now saying that now the believer is
[46:38] going to come into a place or to a
[46:40] position to where actually he can speak
[46:43] the word but if there is no doubt in his
[46:46] heart that if he speaks those things he
[46:49] shall have them and i just want to say
[46:51] this scripture reminds me of restoration
[46:53] because when he when he says that there
[46:55] there is no doubt in your heart if
[46:57] there's no doubt well i want to tell you
[46:59] that what man could have no doubt in his
[47:02] heart but yet that word would come and
[47:04] restore that heart back to perfection
[47:07] because that's exactly what we're
[47:09] sitting under is a message of
[47:11] restoration to restore the heart back to
[47:14] the original faith and so when i look at
[47:16] this scripture here and he's saying oh
[47:18] if you don't have any doubt in your
[47:20] heart but you believe what you're saying
[47:22] oh it just speaks a a restoration to me
[47:26] because to think here once there was a
[47:28] man who was on the earth adam was able
[47:31] to stand there he had power and
[47:33] authority and he had dominion over the
[47:35] earth and he didn't have to go to jesus
[47:38] or go to christ the logos go to god or
[47:40] maybe when they walked in they eaten
[47:41] there he didn't have to ask him oh oh
[47:44] should i do this or can i but no he was
[47:47] he was a miniature messiah he had full
[47:49] complete dominion over the earth and he
[47:52] could just speak the word and his word
[47:54] was just as good as god's word he didn't
[47:56] have to ask for permission
[48:01] and he could speak the word and there
[48:03] was no doubt or unbelief in adam's heart
[48:07] because he knew that his word was just
[48:09] as good as god's word and so he could
[48:11] speak that word and he could stand there
[48:13] in an expectation waiting for that to
[48:16] materialize because there was no doubt
[48:18] or unbelief but i want to say oh my for
[48:21] us uh it would seem just even in our
[48:23] faith as we would claim to be a believer
[48:25] and we would say oh thank god he
[48:27] delivered me god set me free you know
[48:29] the devil's right there to challenge you
[48:31] on that he
[48:33] he's trying to to bring doubt into your
[48:35] heart and to try to make you question
[48:37] your own testimony does anybody know
[48:39] what i'm talking about have you ever got
[48:41] victor in your life and god has done
[48:42] something for you or you've made a
[48:44] proclamation and you you've declared the
[48:46] word of god but it seems that the
[48:48] devil's right there to challenge you on
[48:50] the very word that you've proclaimed and
[48:53] try to discourage you from that word
[48:55] that you've spoken but i want to say as
[48:57] a believer you stay right there standing
[49:00] upon the word of god that that unbelief
[49:02] don't come into your heart because
[49:03] that's what the adversary is there to do
[49:05] is to try to make you doubt your
[49:06] experience to try to doubt what you've
[49:08] claimed to try to make you doubt your
[49:10] testimony no doubt many people have
[49:12] already stood up before the church and
[49:14] they've testified of the work that god
[49:15] done in your life and already you've
[49:17] gone back out and you've found maybe
[49:19] you've fallen short in a few areas the
[49:21] devil wants to use those missteps and he
[49:23] wants to use those areas where you have
[49:25] fallen and you've committed sin and he
[49:27] wants to use that as ammunition against
[49:29] you to start to tear down your faith and
[49:32] try to take away your faith in the word
[49:34] to show you that you really don't have
[49:35] what you thought you had but remember
[49:38] you didn't choose god god chose you this
[49:40] isn't something that you have done this
[49:42] is something that god has god done and
[49:44] he didn't save you to lose you god
[49:46] didn't give you an experience he didn't
[49:48] let you feel his presence he didn't do
[49:50] something for you that he would just let
[49:51] you go and then let you figure it out on
[49:53] his own but this is a work that god has
[49:55] started in you and if god has started
[49:57] the work i want to tell you god is going
[49:59] to finish that work
[50:01] and he's bringing you to a place of
[50:03] perfect faith he's bringing you into a
[50:06] place of adoption
[50:07] he's bringing you to a place to where he
[50:10] can start to mold you and shape you and
[50:12] train you up into that position to where
[50:15] you can stand where you can see the
[50:17] example in the word that just as he
[50:19] stood and said it is written it is
[50:21] written and he would not doubt the very
[50:23] word that he spoke he's bringing a
[50:25] bright church into the maturity in the
[50:27] end time that they'll know where they're
[50:29] standing that they have the mind of
[50:31] christ they have thus said the word and
[50:33] they can stand right there and speak the
[50:35] word and there has to be no doubt or
[50:38] unbelief that's going to enter in there
[50:39] why because their womb is sealed
[50:42] oh thank you jesus
[50:44] thank you jesus that's something he did
[50:47] that's something that god has done for
[50:49] the believer
[50:52] but i marvel at this place in in the
[50:54] scripture here because
[50:57] you know as the disciples were
[50:59] uh this takes place
[51:03] right after palm sunday it's about a
[51:05] week before uh the resurrection and
[51:09] and and the disciples they're going to
[51:11] jerusalem and
[51:12] and jesus looked at the fig tree and
[51:15] and he would have gotten fruit from it
[51:16] but he cursed it
[51:18] he cursed the fig tree because it wasn't
[51:20] bearing any fruit and and as they're
[51:22] passing back by the next day that's when
[51:24] the disciples look at his little master
[51:26] uh look look at the fruit tree
[51:29] it's withering away and it's dying you
[51:31] know i marvel at this because what what
[51:34] what the disciples saw in the natural
[51:36] here they're marveling about here stands
[51:38] a man upon the earth that that where he
[51:40] can curse life and the life will go from
[51:43] and it'll be dead here stands a man upon
[51:45] the earth he can raise the dead he can
[51:47] open the blind eyes here's one standing
[51:49] upon the earth again with full authority
[51:52] and full dominion and i just marvel
[51:54] because here those disciples are
[51:56] standing there and they might wonder
[51:57] what purpose is this why would he curse
[51:59] this fig tree why why why why would it
[52:02] die but you know they could only see
[52:03] there into the natural but you know
[52:05] there was a great spiritual type laying
[52:07] there because there was a curse upon
[52:09] israel because they did not receive the
[52:11] messiah and they were going to hang them
[52:13] on a roman tree and crucify him and the
[52:15] very god that they claimed to serve they
[52:18] killed them
[52:19] they were cursed people and you know the
[52:22] fig tree is a type of israel
[52:25] when the son of man came and he was
[52:26] manifested there oh it was a type there
[52:29] in the natural the disciples could only
[52:31] see that in the natural but there was a
[52:32] great spiritual type there because oh
[52:35] that that that nation was dying of death
[52:37] there they were cursed because they were
[52:38] rejecting the very life of the word
[52:42] but i marvel i was fellowshipper with
[52:44] with cosmic struck me you know under
[52:45] that son of man ministry it's amazing to
[52:48] me that that the disciples saw that in
[52:50] the natural but there was such a
[52:51] spiritual type laying there and it
[52:53] wasn't until the son of man came again
[52:55] in the end time that we saw the
[52:57] spiritual type of israel putting forth
[52:59] its bloods the fig tree coming back home
[53:01] and being a nation showing what time
[53:03] that we're living in oh i tell you look
[53:05] up your redemption draw with nigh we're
[53:07] at the door the rapture is at hand
[53:09] there's something
[53:10] that's happening there's something
[53:11] that's turned i tell you
[53:13] if you ain't ready if you haven't put
[53:14] your wedding down on uh get ready it's
[53:17] it's going home time and things are
[53:18] happening at a breakneck pace uh you
[53:21] just see all the the talk about uh
[53:23] nuclear warfare and and it just seems
[53:25] like they just put out another news
[53:27] notice that russia said look we got
[53:29] bombs everywhere that can destroy
[53:30] everything in 30 minutes well that
[53:32] sounds familiar to me i think a prophet
[53:34] done said that several times back in the
[53:36] 40s 50s and 60s doesn't surprise the
[53:39] bride we're just like right on time
[53:43] we're safe in his wings we're protected
[53:46] that's where we want to be this evening
[53:48] and i just want to tell you that what
[53:50] i'm speaking along the lines is is i
[53:53] want to speak uh tonight on have faith
[53:55] and what you are
[53:57] you got to have faith in what you are
[54:00] and i just really enjoyed the sermon
[54:02] this morning about predestination you
[54:04] know god has a purpose for your life and
[54:06] that purpose is because of who you are
[54:10] amen that's where god has a purpose for
[54:12] your life he came to save you he came to
[54:14] redeem you not just half hazard i'll
[54:16] pick one here or there but god has a
[54:18] purpose for you
[54:21] look i i i i chose my wife and i married
[54:24] her not just because she was a girl
[54:27] no she had a character there was
[54:29] something about her that struck
[54:32] and it identified the character in me
[54:36] and so there was that attraction
[54:38] something took place and that's why i
[54:40] chose her and i asked her to marry me
[54:42] and that's why i give her the gifts that
[54:44] i give her
[54:46] because she's my wife because i chose to
[54:48] look look god has chosen a bride
[54:52] and god has prepared something special
[54:54] for you he has a purpose that he wants
[54:56] to accomplish in your life he's he's
[54:58] given gifts to the church and you're
[55:00] heir to these things that god has given
[55:02] the devil wants to rob you from it
[55:05] the devil wants to rob you from the
[55:07] gifts and the very things that god has
[55:09] given to the church and we just lay
[55:11] around
[55:12] and just wonder well i is it for me you
[55:15] know
[55:16] by your stripes i'm healed or you know
[55:18] the holy ghost and should i have power
[55:20] can i lay hands on the sick shall they
[55:22] recover you know should i have joy
[55:23] unspeakable and full of glory in my life
[55:26] and i see these other people with
[55:28] victory and we lay around like like it's
[55:30] something that we don't know for sure
[55:32] but i want to tell you if it's in the
[55:34] word it's for you
[55:35] it's your identification of what happens
[55:37] with the devil wants to rob you from the
[55:40] gifts that god has poured out upon the
[55:42] church but i want to say there has to be
[55:44] a people who recognize who they are that
[55:46] know who they are and say that's mine
[55:49] i'm going to claim it i'm going to put
[55:51] all my faith and all my strength behind
[55:53] this word because i know it's for me
[55:57] oh praise his name paul would say in
[56:00] romans 8 15 he'd say for you have not
[56:02] received the spirit of bondage again to
[56:04] fear
[56:06] but you have received
[56:08] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[56:11] have a father
[56:12] the spirit beareth witness with our
[56:14] spirit
[56:17] that we are the children of god
[56:20] and if children then heirs
[56:22] heirs of god joint heirs with christ if
[56:25] so be that we suffer with him that we
[56:27] may also be glorified together
[56:30] we're joint heirs
[56:32] we are children of god
[56:35] i know i know we say these things a lot
[56:36] but i tell you what i can't hear it
[56:38] enough
[56:39] you can't tell me i'm predestinated too
[56:41] much you can't tell me i'm a child or a
[56:44] daughter of god too much you can't tell
[56:46] me all the benefits that lay in the word
[56:48] look you can't tell me i love hearing
[56:49] about it and i need to hear it because
[56:51] there's plenty of stuff out there
[56:53] telling me it's not for me there's
[56:55] plenty of stuff out there telling me i'm
[56:57] not a son of god there's plenty of stuff
[56:59] out there telling me not i'm not
[57:00] pre-destination look we're in this
[57:02] little bag of bones this sticky nature
[57:04] and we have missteps and we do things
[57:06] that we're disappointed in and it's
[57:08] right there to stare us right back in
[57:09] the face so you think you have the holy
[57:11] ghost you think you're a child of god
[57:13] you think you got the victory you would
[57:15] have never done those things and if you
[57:16] start to give heir to those things what
[57:19] uh you start to give ear to those things
[57:20] what does it start to do it starts to
[57:22] allow that doubt to try to creep into
[57:24] your heart but look we're standing there
[57:26] as mature sons and daughters of god that
[57:29] we're going to tell that old devil shut
[57:30] your mouth i'm not listening to your
[57:32] nonsense i'm going to say what the word
[57:35] says if he said i'm predestinated i'm
[57:37] predestinated if he said i'm more than a
[57:39] conqueror i'm more than a conqueror if
[57:41] he said i'm sinless then i'm sinless if
[57:44] he said there is there not for no
[57:45] condemnation to them which are in christ
[57:47] jesus then what about it church
[57:50] what are we going to do are we going to
[57:52] take sides with the word are we going to
[57:53] keep listening to those things the devil
[57:55] keeps throwing at us
[57:58] i want to say that you are what the word
[58:00] says you are
[58:03] you are what the word says you you are
[58:07] it's because of who you are
[58:10] look you have certain rights and
[58:12] privileges
[58:13] as a son and daughter of god
[58:17] and it's not because you want it
[58:20] it wasn't a lottery
[58:21] and you picked the right numbers
[58:24] and one day he said
[58:27] i'm the bride of jesus christ i just
[58:29] happened
[58:30] to walk into the right church i just
[58:32] happened to do the right thing and i won
[58:35] the lottery that's not how it works
[58:38] but you you are heir to it because of
[58:41] who you are there are certain privileges
[58:44] and rights that you have as a son and
[58:46] daughter of god
[58:48] i mean how many kids here
[58:51] how many kids do we have here under the
[58:52] age of 15
[58:55] where are they at
[58:56] i see kids under the age of 15 that
[58:58] aren't raising their hands come on raise
[59:00] your hands kids
[59:01] oh yes that's right
[59:03] we got some kids that are under 15.
[59:06] now how many of you after church are
[59:08] going to ask your parents if you can go
[59:09] home with them
[59:11] none of you
[59:14] now probably a lot of you will because i
[59:16] said it
[59:21] you don't have to think like that why
[59:24] because that's your mommy and your daddy
[59:28] they've provided a home
[59:30] you're their son you're their daughter
[59:33] you're heir to it
[59:35] you see the car there when it's time to
[59:37] go home you go get in the car and you go
[59:39] home
[59:40] when you wake up and it's time to eat
[59:42] you see breakfast on the table you know
[59:44] that breakfast is for you
[59:47] you don't have to go well i wonder who
[59:49] that's for you know who that's for
[59:51] sit on down and start eating it if you
[59:54] don't like the broccoli and the
[59:55] vegetables eat it too
[59:57] it's for you
[59:59] and i and i think so many times as sons
[1:00:01] and daughters of god we want to question
[1:00:04] and ask permission for the very thing
[1:00:06] that god has given to you and he's on
[1:00:08] the other end begging you to take it
[1:00:11] look it's for you that's why i died
[1:00:13] that's why i went to calvary that's why
[1:00:15] i took your place on calvary that's why
[1:00:18] i took your sin and i bore him upon your
[1:00:20] back because i was wanting full
[1:00:23] restoration i was wanting a bride
[1:00:25] without spot without wrinkle that would
[1:00:27] stand in the evil day with full
[1:00:29] confidence that would stand with the
[1:00:31] boldness in the face of the enemy and
[1:00:33] tell him look i am the virtuous daughter
[1:00:36] of jesus christ you can't do anything to
[1:00:38] hurt me
[1:00:40] you can laugh me to score and you can
[1:00:42] make fun of me the way i dress you can
[1:00:44] tell me i don't have any friends you can
[1:00:46] tell me i go to a crazy church you can
[1:00:49] tell me my family's crazy i don't care
[1:00:51] what you say because i'm heir to all my
[1:00:53] lord jesus christ has purchased for me
[1:00:58] but we need to go into the storehouse
[1:01:00] and start packing it out
[1:01:03] we need to start bringing it home
[1:01:06] we need to keep quit quit wondering if
[1:01:08] we're worthy he said you're worthy
[1:01:12] look
[1:01:14] you were so worthy
[1:01:18] that he climbed a hill called galgotha
[1:01:24] and took every single one of your sins
[1:01:27] past present and future
[1:01:32] every single one of them
[1:01:34] and died for you
[1:01:37] i think i've shared this story before
[1:01:40] i was witnessing to a man one time and
[1:01:43] and and
[1:01:44] and and i just brought him down to the
[1:01:46] place of now accepting the sacrifice of
[1:01:49] jesus christ for all of his wrongs and
[1:01:51] he said i can't do it
[1:01:53] i said why can't you do he goes because
[1:01:54] i don't deserve it i i couldn't i i
[1:01:57] don't deserve to take that
[1:01:59] and it's just about that time i saw his
[1:02:01] uh
[1:02:02] his young daughter she must have been
[1:02:03] maybe just starting to drive maybe uh 17
[1:02:06] years old and she'd come out of the
[1:02:07] house and go in the car i'm like now i
[1:02:08] want to ask you something
[1:02:10] would you lay down your life for your
[1:02:11] daughter
[1:02:13] no not even a question
[1:02:15] and i said now i want to ask you what
[1:02:16] would you do if your daughter committed
[1:02:18] a fence
[1:02:20] but you went to the courthouse and you
[1:02:22] said you know what i'm going to stand in
[1:02:24] the place for my daughter and i am going
[1:02:27] to lay down my life and i am going to
[1:02:29] die and you laid down your life and you
[1:02:31] paid the penalty for your daughter's
[1:02:33] offense could you imagine your daughter
[1:02:35] standing there and saying nope
[1:02:38] i can't accept that
[1:02:40] i'm not worthy of it i did the crime i
[1:02:42] do the time look so many times the devil
[1:02:45] wants to play tricks with your mind
[1:02:47] like you got to do some penance
[1:02:50] now look you reap what you sow but i'm
[1:02:52] telling you that if you have repented of
[1:02:54] your sins and you pled the blood of
[1:02:56] jesus christ we ain't catholics around
[1:02:58] here we don't need to whip you over the
[1:03:00] back and have you crawl on your knees
[1:03:01] and gromble up here on the altar for two
[1:03:04] and a half hours wondering if god's
[1:03:05] forgiven you god forgave you you know i
[1:03:07] know god forgave you because he said so
[1:03:12] hey it's not a sin question he took the
[1:03:15] sin question and he answered it when he
[1:03:17] spread forth his arms and calvary and
[1:03:19] said it is finished
[1:03:21] oh glory to god if there's somebody here
[1:03:24] that's under the sound of my voice
[1:03:25] tonight and the sin question is floating
[1:03:28] over your head i pray tonight that it's
[1:03:30] settled once and for all that when he
[1:03:32] spread his arms he thought of you you
[1:03:35] were on his mind in every sin every
[1:03:37] iniquity everything that you've ever
[1:03:39] done he spread forth his arms for you
[1:03:42] are his son you are his daughter and he
[1:03:44] said it is finished
[1:03:49] so now every redemptive blessing is
[1:03:51] yours
[1:03:54] well go ahead the price has been paid
[1:03:56] don't stop now you've already accepted
[1:03:59] forgiveness for your sin
[1:04:00] well the purchase of calvary wasn't just
[1:04:02] to forgive you for your sin
[1:04:05] it's called redemption
[1:04:09] because we're going back to something
[1:04:12] we're going back to where we were with
[1:04:14] him in the beginning
[1:04:15] back before there was sin back to the
[1:04:17] perfect picture
[1:04:19] back to that image god had of you in his
[1:04:22] mind in the very beginning and because
[1:04:24] that thought is an eternal thought as we
[1:04:26] drop down here in the hickey of time
[1:04:28] nothing in this little space of time can
[1:04:30] stop you from getting back to that
[1:04:32] perfect picture because eternity
[1:04:34] eternity can never pass away
[1:04:37] look you can no more die than god can
[1:04:39] die
[1:04:40] yeah we've said it before and maybe
[1:04:42] we've chalked it up where it's just
[1:04:43] common head knowledge now let me say it
[1:04:45] again you can no more die than god can
[1:04:47] die
[1:04:48] that should be something we chew on for
[1:04:50] a little bit
[1:04:52] first john 5 would say 5 4 would say for
[1:04:55] whosoever is born of god overcometh the
[1:04:58] world and this is the victory that
[1:05:00] overcometh the world even our faith
[1:05:03] for whosoever is born of god overcometh
[1:05:05] the world
[1:05:08] well when were you born of god
[1:05:13] when were you born of god or am i going
[1:05:14] to go through and say well you know it
[1:05:16] was that day brother branham said every
[1:05:18] birth is a mess and oh i was i was born
[1:05:22] again on the only reason you can be born
[1:05:24] again is because you're the elect of god
[1:05:28] so all you're doing is manifesting the
[1:05:31] predestination
[1:05:34] is that what we heard this morning
[1:05:36] because you are a son and daughter of
[1:05:38] god because there was a perfect image of
[1:05:41] you in the very beginning that is the
[1:05:43] only reason you're able to be reborn is
[1:05:46] because there was a perfect image that
[1:05:49] said that you are going to be redeemed
[1:05:51] you're going to be forgiven you're going
[1:05:53] to be born again you're going to
[1:05:54] experience all of my attributes and when
[1:05:57] you have played out that part of the
[1:05:59] great drama i'm going to pull you right
[1:06:01] back to me where you were in the
[1:06:03] beginning as if you never did it in the
[1:06:05] first place and that's the revelation
[1:06:07] that strikes the bride that's come to
[1:06:09] the bride in the end time the true
[1:06:11] revelation of justification is that you
[1:06:14] never did it in the first place if you
[1:06:16] ever catch a revelation of true
[1:06:19] justification it sets you free it
[1:06:22] produces a victory in the camp to know
[1:06:25] that all of the sins and all of your
[1:06:27] past though you did them you never did
[1:06:29] them in the first place oh my call me a
[1:06:31] crazy man call me a lunatic but i can
[1:06:34] stare that devil right back in the face
[1:06:36] and tell him i'm sinless
[1:06:40] you wonder why people get excited
[1:06:44] when they get born again
[1:06:47] you wonder why people i have an
[1:06:49] experience of the holy ghost when they
[1:06:50] go through prayer lines and they go to
[1:06:52] camp and they feel the presence of god
[1:06:54] come upon them because all of that
[1:06:57] burden of sin they've been packing
[1:06:58] around their whole life
[1:07:02] could you imagine if i had all these
[1:07:03] chains wrapped around me and everything
[1:07:05] and and i was just walking around and
[1:07:09] and everybody was looking at me like
[1:07:10] what's wrong with you what are you doing
[1:07:12] like what are you talking about those
[1:07:13] chains
[1:07:15] all that those locks and all that
[1:07:18] weights and everything that you're
[1:07:19] carrying around like what are you
[1:07:20] talking about
[1:07:22] this is normal this is who i am that's
[1:07:24] what the unbeliever or if i will say
[1:07:26] like this that's what the son and
[1:07:28] daughter of god is going through while
[1:07:30] they're living in that stage of
[1:07:31] spiritual amnesia because they don't
[1:07:33] know who they are but what the message
[1:07:35] has come to do is to reveal you who you
[1:07:38] are and in the plan of god in the season
[1:07:40] and the hour that you're coming into
[1:07:41] manifestation and when that starts to
[1:07:44] break upon the believer and those
[1:07:46] shackles and those chains start to fall
[1:07:48] off of you all of a sudden you feel so
[1:07:50] light oh does anybody know what i'm
[1:07:52] talking about when that burden of sin
[1:07:55] starts to drop off of you and you feel
[1:07:57] weightless you feel so free you feel
[1:07:59] like you can fly you feel like you can
[1:08:01] run you feel like you can dance and all
[1:08:03] of a sudden those things that you feel
[1:08:05] you start to do it you start to dance
[1:08:07] you start to shout why because you're
[1:08:08] experiencing something that's real
[1:08:12] i'm not a slave anymore i'm not in
[1:08:15] bondage anymore i don't have to go back
[1:08:17] to the way things were
[1:08:21] oh sure you might experience that
[1:08:23] deliverance and you go home okay maybe
[1:08:25] you're in a place of justification or
[1:08:27] sanctification maybe you do slip up
[1:08:29] maybe you do fall down again we'll have
[1:08:31] this i have the experience again
[1:08:35] repent
[1:08:36] get right with god get back to the place
[1:08:38] go back to where you left him
[1:08:41] and let the grace of god be revealed to
[1:08:43] you okay lord
[1:08:45] i i didn't pass the test
[1:08:48] so lord i'm coming back i'm repenting of
[1:08:49] my sins
[1:08:51] lord i'm praying for the holy ghost that
[1:08:53] you seal me that you feel me
[1:08:55] that when the test comes again lord i'm
[1:08:57] i'm prepared now
[1:08:59] i'm armed i'm ready
[1:09:01] with one hand on the sword
[1:09:04] like the wall of nehemiah they had one
[1:09:05] hand on the sword in one hand they were
[1:09:06] working
[1:09:07] that's how we want to be as christians
[1:09:09] we want to have one hand on the sword we
[1:09:11] want to be working we want to be
[1:09:13] building the church of god we want to be
[1:09:14] building up the family of god we want to
[1:09:16] be fighting for our brothers and
[1:09:17] fighting for our sisters but we want to
[1:09:19] have our hand cleaved to that sword when
[1:09:21] that devil shows up we draw the sword
[1:09:23] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:09:25] them that are in christ jesus i can do
[1:09:27] all things through jesus christ that
[1:09:28] strengthens me
[1:09:29] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:09:31] i live yet not i but christ liveth in me
[1:09:34] in the life that i now live in the flesh
[1:09:35] i live by the faith of the son i get
[1:09:37] back devil
[1:09:39] we're in a spiritual warfare
[1:09:42] and the prophet of god in the opening
[1:09:44] statements in perfect faith forgot to
[1:09:45] look at the clock again so
[1:09:47] i
[1:09:49] i'll only be 45 minutes from this point
[1:09:53] at least i don't know how long i've been
[1:09:56] prophet of god would say this in perfect
[1:09:57] faith he said now faith is based on
[1:09:59] forgiveness
[1:10:02] we could preach there for a while
[1:10:04] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:10:08] it starts there with repentance
[1:10:10] what is the formula to receive in the
[1:10:12] holy ghost
[1:10:14] repent
[1:10:16] if you have truly repented of your sins
[1:10:21] and you have received the forgiveness
[1:10:23] and received a pardon
[1:10:26] i think it's extremely difficult for you
[1:10:28] to hold sins to hold a grudge against a
[1:10:31] brother
[1:10:32] when somebody does you wrong when i it's
[1:10:35] just to me it's it's a very difficult
[1:10:37] thing to hold a grudge
[1:10:39] i i don't know about you maybe you'd be
[1:10:41] justified but it'll drive me nuts i i
[1:10:44] can't i can't live like that
[1:10:46] like i i am i i am i i just i i want to
[1:10:50] talk about it right away
[1:10:52] my brother david's the worst about it
[1:10:54] he he'll he'll he'll he he might get he
[1:10:57] might do something to to to to to to
[1:10:59] just you know like really and and he's
[1:11:02] just like five seconds it's already gone
[1:11:04] like it never happened you're like wait
[1:11:05] a second we gotta have some time to like
[1:11:07] be mad
[1:11:09] but you're taking this too far here this
[1:11:11] not have a grudge and just put it in the
[1:11:13] past thing
[1:11:14] you can't just slap me like hey man
[1:11:16] we're all forgiven right we're good
[1:11:20] but really there should be a love in our
[1:11:22] heart that no matter what our brother or
[1:11:24] sister does to offend us there ought to
[1:11:26] be an ability if you've ever experienced
[1:11:28] the grace of god if you've ever
[1:11:31] experienced this love oh if you've ever
[1:11:33] been pulled out of a mucking mire if
[1:11:35] you've ever been pulled out of sin if
[1:11:37] you've ever been forgiven if i can get a
[1:11:39] little bit more volume on the on the
[1:11:41] monitors
[1:11:43] oh if you've ever been forgiven
[1:11:47] then when you when you see somebody else
[1:11:50] that's offended or needs forgiveness
[1:11:52] there's something inside you there's a
[1:11:54] life in you
[1:11:56] that just wants to pour out and forgive
[1:12:00] because it's the life of christ that's
[1:12:01] in you
[1:12:02] so if you ever find yourself holding a
[1:12:04] grudge
[1:12:05] you need to check up in your heart you
[1:12:07] need to make that and the scripture says
[1:12:09] never let the sun go down upon your
[1:12:10] wrath that always spoke to me that don't
[1:12:12] let those things don't let the sun go
[1:12:14] down uh without making things right just
[1:12:17] the the prophet of god would say this
[1:12:18] did i even read it we're trying to get
[1:12:19] somewhere
[1:12:22] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:12:24] then as we said this morning trying to
[1:12:26] get the church
[1:12:27] into the place to where we could really
[1:12:30] see apostolic times moving among us
[1:12:34] i try to slow down and reading this
[1:12:41] maybe i i'll uh let me try the handheld
[1:12:47] y'all can probably hear me
[1:12:49] uh perfect out there but
[1:12:54] i'm a challenge so i apologize
[1:12:56] i can hear myself now
[1:13:00] so brother random saying here in perfect
[1:13:02] faith he says now faith is based on
[1:13:03] forgiveness and then as we said this
[1:13:06] morning trying to get the church into a
[1:13:08] place to where we could really see
[1:13:09] apostolic times moving among us
[1:13:12] that's what we all hunger
[1:13:15] now if the prophet of god is saying this
[1:13:16] in 1963
[1:13:18] after the seals have been broke and
[1:13:20] august 25th he's saying trying to get
[1:13:23] the church into a place to where we
[1:13:25] could really see apostolic times moving
[1:13:27] among us that's what we all hunger i
[1:13:30] want to say there's something in my
[1:13:31] heart that is hungering for apostolic
[1:13:34] times and he says it's just laying right
[1:13:36] at the door we see it but we want to see
[1:13:38] more of it we want to see such a flow
[1:13:41] that it will help us and flow out to
[1:13:43] others now watch this he says now he
[1:13:46] says remember jesus as we had the lesson
[1:13:48] this morning he never used his power for
[1:13:51] himself he used it for others that's
[1:13:56] what it was sent for now we know that
[1:13:58] eternal life is living for others
[1:14:01] and right here we're reading the prophet
[1:14:02] of god saying remember jesus he never
[1:14:05] used his powers for others uh for
[1:14:07] himself he used it for others that's
[1:14:11] what it was sent forth sent forth so i
[1:14:14] want to speak along these lines that's
[1:14:16] where we're wanting to move to where we
[1:14:18] see apostolic times where our faith is
[1:14:21] not always on the defensive
[1:14:23] well we're not just trying to keep our
[1:14:25] borders and we're just trying to to keep
[1:14:27] the devil away from us and we're just
[1:14:29] trying to keep a patch up job and we're
[1:14:31] just trying to keep the enemy from
[1:14:33] coming in like a flood and and the flood
[1:14:35] waters are coming all up around us and
[1:14:37] we're trying to pack sandbags over here
[1:14:39] and over here like oh man i let the bar
[1:14:41] down back over here and we're running
[1:14:43] back and forth and we're like in a
[1:14:44] sinking ship and we got a bucket of
[1:14:46] water we're constantly trying to stay
[1:14:47] afloat that's not where we want to be at
[1:14:50] you know there's an old saying i believe
[1:14:52] george washington said it he said the
[1:14:54] best defense is a good offense
[1:14:57] and we don't want to just always be
[1:14:59] sitting
[1:15:00] on the defensive side that every time
[1:15:02] the devil tries to come and attack us
[1:15:04] that we're just there with our shield
[1:15:06] and trying to weather the storms but we
[1:15:08] want to get to the place to where we're
[1:15:09] moving out and we're expanding our
[1:15:11] borders and we're going after loved ones
[1:15:14] we're going we're taking the word of
[1:15:16] faith down the road and we're
[1:15:17] accomplishing things and we're expanding
[1:15:19] our borders
[1:15:20] just as our brother andrew was
[1:15:23] just sharing his heart that there should
[1:15:25] be a faith and an ability in the pride
[1:15:27] of jesus christ that could stand in the
[1:15:30] gap knowing who she is that we can stand
[1:15:32] there and say oh god i'm asking you why
[1:15:35] because of who i am and i know you hear
[1:15:37] my prayer
[1:15:39] because of who i am i'm coming to you
[1:15:41] lord and you said if i ask anything in
[1:15:44] your name that you would do it then we
[1:15:46] could stand right there with a faith and
[1:15:48] a confidence speaking the word and
[1:15:50] asking the word and then standing and
[1:15:51] waiting for that word to be manifested
[1:15:55] well that's eternal life
[1:15:58] is living for others
[1:16:02] the prophet of god said
[1:16:04] jesus never used the power
[1:16:06] for himself
[1:16:08] he said he used it for others he said
[1:16:11] that's what it was sent for
[1:16:14] then i'll ask you what is the holy ghost
[1:16:16] sent for
[1:16:18] is it not the same life
[1:16:20] then what was the holy ghost sent forth
[1:16:23] it's not to just use for yourself
[1:16:26] so many times we just create a safe
[1:16:28] haven
[1:16:29] i'm an overcomer now
[1:16:32] you know what i'm able to make it to
[1:16:34] church three times a week i mean i i got
[1:16:36] everything in check i've i've i've found
[1:16:38] things that are lawful
[1:16:40] they're not expedient but you can't say
[1:16:42] anything against it i got my little
[1:16:44] sports i i got my my uh uh what do they
[1:16:48] call those there's
[1:16:50] some word for uh
[1:16:52] i'll call it vanity sports
[1:16:54] something they got some type of sports
[1:16:56] where you pick all these players what do
[1:16:57] they call that
[1:16:59] fantasy like i said vanity sports so you
[1:17:02] know but you got all these things that
[1:17:04] we can spend our time and we kind of
[1:17:06] carve out a little comfortable niche
[1:17:10] and we're believers you know
[1:17:12] and i got enough holy ghost to keep the
[1:17:14] devil off of me i'm living a victorious
[1:17:16] life you know i'm not addicted to the
[1:17:17] things i used to be addicted to anymore
[1:17:19] and
[1:17:20] and you know when the devil comes around
[1:17:22] you know i i'm not caught up in all
[1:17:23] those things that's not what the holy
[1:17:25] ghost was sent for
[1:17:27] the holy ghost was sent that not that
[1:17:30] you would use the power for yourself but
[1:17:32] that you'd use that power for others
[1:17:36] well it makes me think of abraham there
[1:17:38] in in
[1:17:39] genesis 14 14 what happened when when he
[1:17:42] found out that his brother lot had been
[1:17:44] taken
[1:17:46] lord was
[1:17:47] abraham was able to stand there and say
[1:17:49] you know what
[1:17:50] i am going after lot
[1:17:53] though my brother's backslidden no he's
[1:17:55] been pulled out there in the world i am
[1:17:57] going to go after my brother regardless
[1:17:59] of the cost you realize that all's he
[1:18:02] had was was his hired men servants i
[1:18:04] think you think about 300 men and he
[1:18:06] beat his plows and
[1:18:09] and beat shears into swords and and went
[1:18:11] after armies
[1:18:15] now you would think that abraham didn't
[1:18:16] have much of a chance
[1:18:20] but
[1:18:21] who was abraham
[1:18:24] see abraham knew who he was
[1:18:27] and i got to thinking about that a
[1:18:29] little bit because god had made a
[1:18:30] promise to abraham
[1:18:32] and so abraham knew that god gave me a
[1:18:35] promise
[1:18:36] and that he said i will bless your seed
[1:18:39] and i will multiply thy seed and i know
[1:18:42] who i am and i've walked the borders
[1:18:44] i've seen the borders so i'm going to go
[1:18:46] after my brother and i can go after him
[1:18:48] in the face of death and no matter what
[1:18:51] the devil can't destroy me and i'll say
[1:18:53] this even more maybe abraham was going
[1:18:55] after him and going that way and maybe
[1:18:57] his men servant started to question him
[1:18:59] and said abraham what are you going to
[1:19:00] do if god if you die on this journey say
[1:19:02] well god i have to raise me up again
[1:19:04] because he promised me that my seed
[1:19:07] shall possess the land shall possess the
[1:19:09] gate of my enemy so you think that's
[1:19:11] something walks me out of the
[1:19:12] battlefield if i die i'm going to get
[1:19:14] right back up because god said that i'm
[1:19:16] going to bring forth the promised son
[1:19:18] and nothing can stop the promise of god
[1:19:21] i want to tell you god has made you a
[1:19:23] promise and there ain't nothing that can
[1:19:24] stop you live or die i don't care what
[1:19:27] difference does it make if you don't go
[1:19:29] in the rapture on this side you're going
[1:19:31] to go in the rapture on the other side
[1:19:33] so i say why don't you draw your sword
[1:19:35] why don't you go after your brothers why
[1:19:37] don't you go after your sisters why
[1:19:38] don't you go after a lot and those
[1:19:40] prodigal ones why don't you beat your uh
[1:19:42] plows and the shears on the source and
[1:19:44] go after lost loved ones
[1:19:47] what do you got to fear church
[1:19:49] you gotta fear your reputation
[1:19:52] you gotta fear your big standings within
[1:19:54] the local community and i am this on the
[1:19:57] hoa and if i witness to to to to mr
[1:20:00] so-and-so then i'm gonna get kicked off
[1:20:02] the board well you need to get kicked
[1:20:04] off the board because they should know
[1:20:05] what you believe already
[1:20:08] yeah i think sometimes that's my rule of
[1:20:09] thumb if i stand around and talk to
[1:20:11] somebody and i give them two or three
[1:20:12] minutes to tell me about their story
[1:20:14] well they need at least hear my story
[1:20:19] sometimes we just sit around and
[1:20:20] somebody starts to talk and they just
[1:20:22] they tell you oh this is where i'm from
[1:20:23] and this is what we're doing and this is
[1:20:25] our plan and they just go on and preach
[1:20:27] their little gospel and their world and
[1:20:29] everything they're all doing and you let
[1:20:31] them ramble on for five or ten minutes
[1:20:33] about something that's gonna burn
[1:20:37] and then we're so spiritual we say oh
[1:20:39] that's wonderful well
[1:20:41] nice to meet you
[1:20:42] really
[1:20:44] come on now
[1:20:45] oh brother matthew we need dupes deep
[1:20:47] supernatural things uh yeah yeah this is
[1:20:49] deep supernatural things
[1:20:52] because this is the test this is the
[1:20:54] proving ground if the life
[1:20:55] of the holy ghost is in you because it's
[1:20:58] a life that's living for others there
[1:21:00] has to be something inside of you that's
[1:21:02] looking for the opportunity you're
[1:21:04] looking for the window you're waiting
[1:21:06] for the weather you're waiting for
[1:21:07] something you're waiting where's my
[1:21:08] window where's my entrance
[1:21:11] where's my opportunity how do i tie this
[1:21:13] together how do i loop this in how do i
[1:21:15] get the message how do i get this to
[1:21:16] christ what where am i looking for lord
[1:21:19] i'm watching i'm waiting how are you
[1:21:20] going to turn this is this is this a
[1:21:22] seed of you lord there needs to be an
[1:21:24] expectation something in your heart
[1:21:26] that's looking for the supernatural to
[1:21:28] unfold
[1:21:29] look we're supernatural people
[1:21:32] we're we abraham was was was manifesting
[1:21:36] the predestinated plan of god and that's
[1:21:39] something we got to realize is that each
[1:21:41] day that we're living out we're living
[1:21:43] out the predestinated plan of god
[1:21:47] and and that's his will that's his word
[1:21:49] and he's wanting us to come to a place
[1:21:51] of maturity where that word is in our
[1:21:53] heart and we're not just sitting around
[1:21:55] wondering what if what if but we're
[1:21:57] going out and we're expanding our
[1:21:59] borders we're taking the word out in the
[1:22:01] field and we're winning victories
[1:22:04] oh god help us to win to have a
[1:22:06] victorious life like that
[1:22:10] god's made you a promise
[1:22:14] but i wonder
[1:22:16] many times we don't act like it
[1:22:19] right
[1:22:21] you know god's god's made you a promise
[1:22:23] we're going in a body change we're going
[1:22:25] in a rapture
[1:22:26] but i think that's the challenge is to
[1:22:28] act like it on a daily basis
[1:22:31] you know it reminds me of that little
[1:22:32] story about the ranch girl where where
[1:22:34] the uh the the big owner of the ranch
[1:22:37] sent his son on down he was he was
[1:22:38] looking for a wife and you know he he
[1:22:40] didn't like all all the the girls with
[1:22:43] all their dress up and everything but he
[1:22:45] found that girl with real the wash girl
[1:22:47] was throwing out the the wash water he
[1:22:49] found real character in her
[1:22:51] he said you know i'm coming back this
[1:22:52] next time next year to marry you and he
[1:22:54] made a promise to her and all those
[1:22:56] girls
[1:22:57] you know they made fun of her
[1:22:59] they said what are you talking about you
[1:23:00] think the boss's daughter the the owner
[1:23:03] of the armory son would he would have
[1:23:05] anything to do with a low life like you
[1:23:07] but regardless of all of the insults
[1:23:10] regardless of how they carried on with
[1:23:12] their fancy parties and and their big
[1:23:15] hoop laws and everything that they were
[1:23:16] doing this young girl started making
[1:23:18] preparation she started making plans
[1:23:21] that she was getting ready
[1:23:23] you want to know what that looks like
[1:23:26] well there's a couple girls in our
[1:23:27] church that are getting married
[1:23:29] sister grace and sister janet just
[1:23:31] talked to him for five or ten minutes

[1:23:47] that way
[1:23:49] everything that's been built up oh

[1:24:50] invisible union going on and i just want
[1:24:53] to take a little time and tell you that
[1:24:55] if you look for me you ain't gonna find
[1:24:58] me why because he's already split the
[1:25:00] eastern sky he's on his way and i'm
[1:25:02] getting my wedding garment on to meet
[1:25:04] him in the air
[1:25:06] oh i think there ought to be a bride
[1:25:07] rising up in the end time that's all you
[1:25:10] can talk about that's all you can think
[1:25:12] about when you come in contact with the
[1:25:14] neighbor when you come in contact with
[1:25:15] the boss you want to give them an rsvp
[1:25:18] invisible union of the heavenly
[1:25:20] bridegroom and the earthly bride read
[1:25:22] that a little bit it'll tell you what
[1:25:23] i'm thinking about it'll tell you what
[1:25:24] i'm what i'm talking about
[1:25:28] oh we got to have a life that starts to
[1:25:30] line up
[1:25:32] with what we're talking about
[1:25:35] a confession
[1:25:37] but a life that follows up the
[1:25:38] confession
[1:25:40] and trust me
[1:25:42] you think i'm lying go look for grace
[1:25:44] next saturday
[1:25:47] won't be here
[1:25:49] she'll be gone
[1:25:51] and i'm telling you
[1:25:53] that's a good natural point to make
[1:25:55] because there's going to be a lot of
[1:25:57] people one day
[1:25:59] they're going to look around oh glory to
[1:26:01] god
[1:26:02] i'm getting excited now
[1:26:05] why because i've already heard my
[1:26:06] eliezer he's already come and he said
[1:26:09] look that's isaac that's your bridegroom
[1:26:12] out there on the field why don't you go
[1:26:13] out there to meet him and he unveiled
[1:26:16] the mighty god unveiled before us he
[1:26:18] introduced me to christ the word my mate
[1:26:20] and i'm now coming to a union with him
[1:26:22] and i'm just waiting to be caught away
[1:26:25] i'm just waiting for the change of my
[1:26:27] body
[1:26:28] oh god has made you a promise just like
[1:26:30] he made abraham a promise
[1:26:34] oh my
[1:26:35] i love that story about abraham
[1:26:40] because god god made sure that the bride
[1:26:42] wasn't left out
[1:26:44] sarah was part of that promise
[1:26:47] so what was it there in the plains of
[1:26:49] memory melchizedek come walking up
[1:26:52] and says where's your wife
[1:26:56] and he discerned the thoughts and
[1:26:58] intents of sarah's heart
[1:27:01] and said according to the time of life
[1:27:03] you shall have a son that's the same
[1:27:04] thing that's happened to the bride of
[1:27:06] jesus christ the son of man has come
[1:27:08] he's discerned the thoughts and intents
[1:27:10] of the heart and i believe it's that
[1:27:11] spoken word of melchizedek of the son of
[1:27:14] man that is producing a faith for the
[1:27:17] bride to receive strength to go into a
[1:27:19] rapture and into a body change look you
[1:27:21] got to feed on this bodywork son of man
[1:27:23] that's going to be the thing that
[1:27:24] changes your body
[1:27:28] it's not going to come any other way
[1:27:31] oh what great promises
[1:27:32] that we have now notice here brother
[1:27:34] branham is saying
[1:27:38] in this opening quote he says in the
[1:27:40] morning service he says i'm trying to
[1:27:41] get the church into a place to where we
[1:27:44] could really see apostolic times moving
[1:27:46] among us
[1:27:48] i want to say that if you really want to
[1:27:50] see what apostolic times look like just
[1:27:52] open up your bible
[1:27:53] and start reading acts chapter 2.
[1:27:57] what did the prophet say he said if if
[1:28:00] the if it ever puts forth another branch
[1:28:04] if the vine ever puts forth another
[1:28:06] branch
[1:28:08] it'll write another book of acts
[1:28:11] he said as long as god is still sending
[1:28:15] god called men
[1:28:16] with the word of life
[1:28:18] the apostolic age is still on
[1:28:22] well you want to know you you want to
[1:28:24] know what a book of acts looks like
[1:28:27] well get your pen out and start writing
[1:28:29] what do you think happened easter camp
[1:28:31] weekend
[1:28:32] uh is there somebody not that knows what
[1:28:34] i'm talking about there's somebody here
[1:28:35] that's been delivered as there's
[1:28:37] somebody here that's been set free is
[1:28:39] there somebody here that's been filled
[1:28:41] with the holy ghost is there somebody
[1:28:42] here that was warring and wrestling with
[1:28:44] demons and you couldn't get the victory
[1:28:47] but god rich and mercy he came and he
[1:28:49] cast those devils off of your life and
[1:28:51] he set you free that the victory bell
[1:28:54] could ring and you can say i'm free at
[1:28:56] last free at last
[1:28:58] oh does anybody know what i'm talking
[1:29:00] about
[1:29:02] oh my we just let a couple weeks go by
[1:29:04] and we we just get back mellowed down
[1:29:05] and we forget what's really happened
[1:29:08] i think it's good to be reminded what
[1:29:09] god's done for us
[1:29:11] i think it's good to let that that that
[1:29:14] fire will back up in us and to remind
[1:29:16] ourselves of what god did
[1:29:18] when the prophet of god is trying to
[1:29:19] bring us to something he's saying look i
[1:29:21] i'm wanting to get the church to a place
[1:29:23] where we can really see apostolic times
[1:29:27] moving among us again how many wants to
[1:29:29] see that
[1:29:30] how many of us are believing for that
[1:29:36] well praise god
[1:29:37] trying to figure how long i've been up
[1:29:39] here
[1:29:40] so brother branham preaches how can i
[1:29:42] overcome
[1:29:44] in the morning of august 25th 1963
[1:29:49] and then
[1:29:50] he's going to preach perfect faith that
[1:29:52] evening and many times as i'm studying i
[1:29:54] like to look at uh uh many times how
[1:29:57] brother branham will preach a morning
[1:29:58] service and an evening service and and
[1:30:01] how they they dovetail together so so
[1:30:03] wonderfully and brother branham says
[1:30:05] this he says now so if we're trying to
[1:30:08] follow the message of the hour
[1:30:11] at least this part of the message
[1:30:13] we should live constantly in the life of
[1:30:15] christ see because if it don't you lay
[1:30:18] around and you know that these things
[1:30:20] you're supposed to do and you don't do
[1:30:22] it
[1:30:23] the bible said he know he that knoweth
[1:30:26] to do good and doeth it not to him it's
[1:30:29] sinned
[1:30:31] now that doesn't mean he he that knoweth
[1:30:33] not to sin
[1:30:36] but to do good
[1:30:39] look if god has put something on your
[1:30:41] heart to do
[1:30:44] and you don't do it
[1:30:46] now we're talking about maturity
[1:30:49] we're talking about doing those things
[1:30:51] that we know to do that are right we're
[1:30:52] not talking about you know oh
[1:30:55] you that
[1:30:56] keep sinning and you know not to sin you
[1:30:58] know that sin well that's no that's not
[1:31:00] what we're saying here
[1:31:01] he that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[1:31:03] not to him but sin then you become doty
[1:31:06] rotten
[1:31:07] when you're separated from the life of
[1:31:09] god so strive
[1:31:11] with all that's in you to stay in the
[1:31:14] life of christ that you would be fruit
[1:31:17] bearing
[1:31:21] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[1:31:23] the life of christ that you would be
[1:31:26] fruit bearing now you know this just
[1:31:28] reminds me and maybe we'll find a place
[1:31:31] to end along these lines but this
[1:31:32] reminds me of the story in in samuel
[1:31:35] where david in 2nd samuel 11 1 it says
[1:31:38] you know this is the time when kings
[1:31:40] went forth to battle
[1:31:42] and there uh uh david
[1:31:44] he had sent uh his his general uh joab
[1:31:48] down to fight and i i believe uh uh uh
[1:31:51] they had destroyed the ammonites and
[1:31:53] they were there in that area but the
[1:31:55] scripture says this was a time when
[1:31:58] kings went to battle and i just think
[1:32:00] that's such a profound statement because
[1:32:02] here you would think if this is a time
[1:32:04] when kings went to war here was the most
[1:32:07] mightiest king the world had ever
[1:32:09] ever seen was king david but you know he
[1:32:12] had sent his armies off down the road
[1:32:14] and it was during that time that that
[1:32:16] david had went off on the terrace there
[1:32:18] and he went out and he was looking over
[1:32:20] the wall and there that's when he saw
[1:32:22] the beautiful bathsheba
[1:32:25] and the prophet of god said it was
[1:32:27] david's passions that got him in trouble
[1:32:30] because maybe a time as he was saying if
[1:32:33] you know if you those things you know to
[1:32:34] do and you don't do it you lay around
[1:32:37] and you get dody and you get rotten and
[1:32:39] i just wonder here david just to think
[1:32:41] that here his armies were off to war and
[1:32:44] here he's enjoying the comforts of his
[1:32:46] palace and he comes out there and he
[1:32:48] sees this beautiful woman there and he
[1:32:50] goes to inquire of her and he finds out
[1:32:52] that she's a married woman
[1:32:56] but something had happened to david to
[1:32:58] where he had gotten cold he had gotten
[1:33:00] dodie oh i mean you think of all the
[1:33:03] psalms
[1:33:04] that he had written
[1:33:06] and all of the joys of the lord and him
[1:33:08] being his strength and and here he's
[1:33:10] come to a place where he's oh god's done
[1:33:13] so much in his life
[1:33:15] he's delivered him out of so many
[1:33:17] trouble he's preserved his life he's
[1:33:19] given them the kingdom he's given
[1:33:21] everything he ever had need of here he
[1:33:23] has over 500 wives
[1:33:25] but yeah his passions
[1:33:28] here he's who is that woman
[1:33:31] bring her to me
[1:33:33] and so they bring her
[1:33:34] to david and he lays with her and he
[1:33:36] goes back and they find out she's with
[1:33:38] child
[1:33:39] and all of a sudden david what does he
[1:33:40] want to do oh my goodness
[1:33:42] all right i need to cover up my mistakes
[1:33:46] i'll go go get uriah
[1:33:48] bring them home
[1:33:50] and then i'm going to try to make up
[1:33:52] some type of story just try to cover up
[1:33:54] my mistake
[1:33:55] you know when you start to try to cover
[1:33:57] up your mistakes and your failures you
[1:33:59] just make it worse
[1:34:01] david would have been a lot better if
[1:34:04] you'd have just repented right then
[1:34:06] and a lot of us would be a lot better
[1:34:09] and i look i know you've made some bad
[1:34:11] decisions i know you've even made some
[1:34:13] bad decisions in the last week or two
[1:34:15] just make it right
[1:34:18] stop letting the devil
[1:34:20] make it seem like it's an impossible
[1:34:22] situation and that covering it up is
[1:34:24] gonna make it go away it's just gonna
[1:34:26] get worse the sooner you come back to
[1:34:29] god the sooner you expose the devil the
[1:34:31] sooner you're going to have victory in
[1:34:33] your life that you can go on with god
[1:34:36] so david calls uriah back and he says oh
[1:34:39] uh you're uh how goes the battle
[1:34:42] he's like oh we're doing good jobs
[1:34:45] up the great general we're winning the
[1:34:47] battle the men are doing good we're
[1:34:48] healthy we're strong
[1:34:49] he goes okay well
[1:34:51] why why don't you go home
[1:34:53] to your to your wife and and why don't
[1:34:55] you just go home and and why don't you
[1:34:57] spend the night there a couple nights
[1:34:58] and and then maybe i'll send you back
[1:35:00] out in the battle
[1:35:02] and job looks at king david
[1:35:06] says my lord
[1:35:09] the ark of the covenant's out in the
[1:35:10] battlefield
[1:35:13] and my general joab's out there fighting
[1:35:17] and the ark of the lord is an open tense
[1:35:19] and the man are scattered across the
[1:35:21] ground
[1:35:22] going to war
[1:35:24] how
[1:35:26] could i go to the comforts of my home
[1:35:29] how could i go to the comforts of my bed
[1:35:31] and lay with my
[1:35:32] wife
[1:35:34] when the ark of the covenant is out in
[1:35:35] the battleground
[1:35:37] could you imagine
[1:35:39] the reproach david was feeling
[1:35:42] being the the the the man of war that
[1:35:45] david was
[1:35:46] being the mighty warrior that david was
[1:35:49] and how many times he had he had fought
[1:35:51] and how many times he was victorious oh
[1:35:54] i feel like david was feeling even more
[1:35:56] helpless and he's like oh my
[1:35:59] oh
[1:35:59] all right okay uriah and your eye just
[1:36:02] slept out there
[1:36:06] at the wall didn't even go home
[1:36:11] and then the next day he tried to
[1:36:13] course him into going back home and he
[1:36:15] wouldn't do it
[1:36:17] so guess what
[1:36:19] he had to develop another plan
[1:36:21] well if that cover-up tactic didn't work
[1:36:24] maybe i'll just have to come up with
[1:36:25] another tactic oh my so god's speaking
[1:36:28] to somebody because so many times we
[1:36:30] want to try to cover our sins and cover
[1:36:32] our mistakes and cover our failures if
[1:36:34] we'll just come clean and make it right
[1:36:37] and go on with god you'll save yourself
[1:36:39] a lot of problems
[1:36:42] but what did david do he decided that oh
[1:36:44] you know what i'm going to do
[1:36:47] now i i'm going to send him back with a
[1:36:50] letter
[1:36:54] and i'm going to kill him
[1:36:56] i'm going to have the men withdrawalman
[1:36:58] here you know uriah was a mighty man of
[1:37:00] valor
[1:37:01] you know you know you know uriah was a
[1:37:04] gentile warrior
[1:37:06] he was a prostitute to the faith of
[1:37:08] israel he was a gentile and i think you
[1:37:11] know it's one of the men out of all the
[1:37:12] men in the bible it's one of the men i
[1:37:14] believe brother better said when i get
[1:37:15] to heaven i want to shake his hand
[1:37:18] and he's the only if you look into he
[1:37:20] he's he's one of the only if you look at
[1:37:22] the lineage
[1:37:24] it actually mentions uriah in the
[1:37:26] lineage of christ instead of bathsheba
[1:37:30] well it mentions uriah the the husband
[1:37:33] of bathsheba in the lineage christ god
[1:37:35] recognizing uriah why there was
[1:37:38] something in uriah that that that there
[1:37:41] was a life something that god saw that
[1:37:44] was honorable that he protected his name
[1:37:47] to think that here he was oh if the ark
[1:37:49] of the covenant if the spirit of god is
[1:37:52] out there on the battlefield i'm not
[1:37:54] gonna go to the comforts of my home what
[1:37:56] a rebuke to david who is out there on
[1:37:59] the terrace wall and he was getting dody
[1:38:01] and rotten and he was indulging in his
[1:38:04] passions
[1:38:07] oh come on come on saints we we got we
[1:38:10] got uh brothers and sisters in our
[1:38:12] church that are fighting battles

[1:38:23] that that if you only knew the cries of
[1:38:25] their heart
[1:38:26] with what they're going through
[1:38:28] and their agony and their torment they
[1:38:30] cry out to god just to make it another
[1:38:33] day because they're so heartbroken

[1:41:41] right here number 68 it's just burning
[1:41:43] and eating me up did you hear what the
[1:41:45] prophet said i want to see something
[1:41:47] like that in our young man because when
[1:41:49] god does something real in your heart
[1:41:51] you can't help but talk about it
[1:41:54] you killed something just it's eating
[1:41:56] you up if you ever felt like i tell
[1:41:58] every brother in here raise their hand
[1:41:59] you sit around you'll sit around and
[1:42:01] every every time there's an opportunity
[1:42:03] and you're sitting on your hands because
[1:42:04] you don't want to do all the talking
[1:42:09] because you know if you open your mouth
[1:42:12] it's going to be hard to shut it up
[1:42:15] we look we learn by god's grace we learn
[1:42:16] control and we learn wisdom and
[1:42:18] we learn to let our elders talk and we
[1:42:20] we we we work these things out you know
[1:42:24] by god's grace
[1:42:26] but there should be something inside of
[1:42:28] you
[1:42:29] and we want to see that in you young
[1:42:30] people and your young men and you young
[1:42:32] sisters we want to see you broaden your
[1:42:34] boundaries we want you to go out and
[1:42:35] start winning souls
[1:42:38] that's what it's like i'm just going to
[1:42:39] call the musicians because
[1:42:42] that's one way to start getting towards
[1:42:43] the clothes
[1:42:46] is anybody can somebody say amen to what
[1:42:48] we're trying to say
[1:42:51] that's what got david in trouble
[1:42:56] a time when kings would go to war
[1:42:59] and so brother branham in that morning
[1:43:01] service he would preach how can i
[1:43:02] overcome and and you know the prophet of
[1:43:05] god would say what does it mean to
[1:43:06] overcome it means to recognize the devil
[1:43:08] in all of his tricks
[1:43:11] you know david would say many are the
[1:43:13] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:43:14] lord you don't have to start playing yet
[1:43:17] i'm not done preaching
[1:43:19] it's just a reminder that i need to be
[1:43:21] done preaching
[1:43:24] psalms 34 19 says many are the
[1:43:26] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:43:27] lord delivereth them out of them all
[1:43:30] and i was just thinking about this you
[1:43:32] know some of our afflictions are
[1:43:33] self-inflicted
[1:43:36] some of our afflictions are
[1:43:38] self-inflicted you know better
[1:43:43] what was it jackson that brother burley
[1:43:45] said he said i don't mind you making
[1:43:46] mistakes
[1:43:48] just make new ones
[1:43:52] can somebody say amen
[1:43:55] see
[1:43:56] it's okay to make mistakes
[1:43:59] make new ones
[1:44:01] because you're gonna come against the
[1:44:03] test again
[1:44:05] and that's how you know that you're an
[1:44:06] overcomer
[1:44:08] is when the same test or trial comes and
[1:44:10] then you overcome
[1:44:12] and you say you know thank god last time
[1:44:14] i didn't overcome that
[1:44:17] now you know the devil's going to go
[1:44:18] back and regroup it's like all right
[1:44:20] well
[1:44:21] we didn't get him on on it that way so
[1:44:22] let's change up the game plan a little
[1:44:24] bit but if we're just laying around like
[1:44:26] hey all right well you know what i
[1:44:28] resisted the devil and he fleed so what
[1:44:30] do y'all guys want to do tonight are we
[1:44:31] going to you know we're going to play
[1:44:32] games are we going to do this are we
[1:44:33] going to do that no when you get that
[1:44:35] victory go back into prayer go back into
[1:44:38] the bible do something now i'm not
[1:44:39] trying to say you got to be like a robot
[1:44:41] and you can't have any fun and we can't
[1:44:42] have any recreation you know brother i i
[1:44:45] endorse recreation
[1:44:46] i enjoy it i think it's needed i i
[1:44:48] believe it's it's a part of a healthy
[1:44:50] diet of a healthy church
[1:44:52] is to spend time together and have
[1:44:54] fellowship and fun and
[1:44:56] and be a family it's many times in in
[1:44:59] those types of events to where where god
[1:45:02] can use the body to minister to one to
[1:45:04] another
[1:45:05] and maybe you see somebody carrying on a
[1:45:07] certain way or dress in a certain way
[1:45:09] and and you can come up and you'll put
[1:45:10] your arm around and say you know hey
[1:45:12] a brother you know there's a there's a
[1:45:14] better better way to do that and then
[1:45:16] you see oh there's a little growth and
[1:45:17] like oh thank thank thanks
[1:45:19] for for you know i didn't realize i you
[1:45:21] know i didn't want to that would be an
[1:45:23] embarrassment and if i didn't know and
[1:45:24] so many times that's that's what the
[1:45:26] body's for there should be a maturity
[1:45:29] and a growth and looking out for one
[1:45:30] another that we can we can have fun we
[1:45:32] can do things together but we do it as
[1:45:35] christians
[1:45:36] we don't we it's not like we we're not
[1:45:38] allowed to do we can't have no fun
[1:45:40] we can't do anything together we can't
[1:45:42] go anywhere wait you know we it was like
[1:45:44] we should just institute the covet rule
[1:45:46] amongst us everybody's six feet apart
[1:45:50] don't want cooties
[1:45:52] right
[1:45:53] or christians
[1:45:55] we can act like christians we're a body
[1:45:57] we're looking out for one another if we
[1:45:58] see somebody conducting themselves then
[1:46:00] what does it say the elders teach the
[1:46:02] younger and if i can say this as humbly
[1:46:05] as i can if maybe i can i can encourage
[1:46:08] you know you know some of the sisters
[1:46:10] have been doing this a while uh if you
[1:46:12] can please help our younger sisters they
[1:46:15] need help
[1:46:17] some of you that have been doing this a
[1:46:18] little while just
[1:46:19] i know it's hard but
[1:46:21] they you'll find out that we have such a
[1:46:24] good group of people and some of them
[1:46:26] just
[1:46:27] they just don't know better
[1:46:29] it might be culture it might be their
[1:46:30] mom it might be their dad they they
[1:46:32] might have heard it but they never
[1:46:33] really it just never struck them and god
[1:46:35] wants to use you look we're talking
[1:46:37] about the holy ghost is not given for
[1:46:39] yourself it's given for others maybe god
[1:46:41] wants you you're the maybe you're you've
[1:46:43] been the one saying i wish so and so
[1:46:45] would do that or i wish they would stop
[1:46:46] doing this well maybe god wants to use
[1:46:48] you to be the mouthpiece that'll go to
[1:46:50] him in love and in prayer and in
[1:46:52] humility and say lord show me the time
[1:46:54] show me the way that i can maybe say
[1:46:56] something to them in love that can win
[1:46:58] their confidence that they can maybe
[1:46:59] hear a word of the lord now we're
[1:47:01] talking about real true christian living
[1:47:04] yeah maybe you can start playing
[1:47:06] something now that'll really get me to
[1:47:07] wind down
[1:47:11] well y'all pulled me down some roads but
[1:47:12] by god's grace i just pray that that we
[1:47:15] when we recognize who we are
[1:47:18] that god has called us and he's ordained
[1:47:20] us
[1:47:22] that that life that he's given us is to
[1:47:24] live for others
[1:47:27] but we get ourselves in a lot of trouble
[1:47:29] but we know we got to recognize the
[1:47:31] devil in all of his tricks
[1:47:34] maybe maybe you can play uh
[1:47:36] uh pour your spirit out on me
[1:47:41] let's just stand
[1:47:47] let's skip down here and this this is
[1:47:51] maybe this quote right here is
[1:47:54] i could say the crux of my inspiration
[1:48:00] and perfect faith
[1:48:04] the prophet of god says speaking of
[1:48:05] jesus he had faith with his power
[1:48:09] how did he he said i can do nothing in
[1:48:11] myself why
[1:48:12] he relied upon what he was
[1:48:16] he relied in knowing
[1:48:19] that he was the word
[1:48:21] and he had faith in god
[1:48:25] who made him the word
[1:48:27] he was god the word
[1:48:30] and they was in him and that give him
[1:48:33] faith
[1:48:34] because he understood his position
[1:48:37] he knowed what he was because the
[1:48:41] scripture had said he was this
[1:48:46] now i want you to listen to this really
[1:48:47] close
[1:48:49] and here every scripture tied in to
[1:48:51] prove that he was exactly what the
[1:48:54] scripture said he would be
[1:48:56] and he knew what he was
[1:48:59] therefore he relied upon what god had
[1:49:02] made him
[1:49:03] and if he did that
[1:49:07] then can we rely upon what god made us
[1:49:10] as believers
[1:49:14] these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:16] believe
[1:49:18] he had faith
[1:49:20] in what he was
[1:49:22] and if you are a believer
[1:49:25] you have faith
[1:49:27] in what you are
[1:49:30] you are a believer
[1:49:33] it just comes to me now
[1:49:35] there's a story about a miss weber she
[1:49:37] was there in jeffersonville
[1:49:38] [Music]
[1:49:40] and she was sick and they'd been praying
[1:49:42] for and
[1:49:45] the angel lord spoke to brother branham
[1:49:47] and said go tell mr webber
[1:49:52] i'm going to take miss weber home
[1:49:54] get their house in order and
[1:49:57] he's gonna have to care for them four or
[1:49:58] five kids on his own
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] so brother branham went down to mr
[1:50:04] webber and said you know god's taking
[1:50:06] miss weber home and
[1:50:08] you can get your house in order
[1:50:12] that didn't change
[1:50:15] miss weber's faith
[1:50:18] she was a believer
[1:50:21] and about the next day or so
[1:50:23] some of her co-workers come in
[1:50:28] they started to talk about
[1:50:29] brother branham in the church
[1:50:32] said oh you know there's nothing to that
[1:50:34] guy
[1:50:36] he said there's nothing to those that
[1:50:38] group of people over there
[1:50:41] it's just a bunch of whoop up and it's
[1:50:43] just a a lie
[1:50:46] miss weber looked at her co-workers and
[1:50:48] she said
[1:50:48] sister weber i'll call her
[1:50:51] she said i might be dying
[1:50:56] i might be on my deathbed

[1:57:01] me
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:16] and i just want to read this
[1:57:18] quote here in
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:20] closing brother branham says
[1:57:23] jesus had perfect faith
[1:57:26] he had it
[1:57:28] and it come because he was the word
[1:57:32] now watch what the prophet's about to
[1:57:34] tie together
[1:57:37] oh we we can
[1:57:39] we can accept jesus had perfect faith
[1:57:42] we can even accept that brother branham
[1:57:44] had perfect faith
[1:57:46] but watch this message in simplicity
[1:57:50] jesus had perfect faith
[1:57:52] and it come because he was the word
[1:57:56] and you
[1:57:57] become the word
[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:00] you become the word
[1:58:01] as you receive the word
[1:58:04] if ye abide in me
[1:58:07] and my words in you
[1:58:09] my words which this word
[1:58:12] abides in you
[1:58:14] then ask what you will
[1:58:16] and it will be done for you
[1:58:18] see if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:58:20] and don't doubt
[1:58:22] but believe in what you said
[1:58:24] then you shall have
[1:58:26] what you said
[1:58:28] so look
[1:58:30] all the doubt all the confusion all the
[1:58:32] struggle all that muck all that mire
[1:58:35] that god has pulled you up now he's
[1:58:37] washing you he's cleansing you and as
[1:58:39] you feed on the message it's not that
[1:58:41] you're becoming the word in a way that
[1:58:42] you never were the word but that
[1:58:44] spiritual
[1:58:47] all amnesia
[1:58:47] potential of the word was already put
[1:58:50] inside of you by that predestinated seed
[1:58:53] it's just faith cometh by hearing the
[1:58:55] word
[1:58:56] and it's the other part of the the
[1:58:57] chinese laundry ticket
[1:58:59] the two are just coming together
[1:59:03] and that gives you the purchasing power
[1:59:05] to claim what's yours
[1:59:06] oh isn't god good
[1:59:12] and now we become anointed
[1:59:15] with that same spirit
[1:59:17] anointed messiahs
[1:59:19] messiahs of the last day to shine forth
[1:59:22] the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:59:24] to show that he is not dead
[1:59:26] but in the form of the holy ghost
[1:59:28] he's in his people moving among his
[1:59:31] bride with a love affair to her pouring
[1:59:33] out into her himself
[1:59:35] they are becoming one for the wedding
[1:59:37] supper
[1:59:38] and the same signs
[1:59:40] promised by the same god in the same
[1:59:42] word
[1:59:43] is making his same manifestations
[1:59:46] there's nothing left
[1:59:48] for us to do
[1:59:49] but believe it
[1:59:51] and believe it it's substance
[1:59:53] and that
[1:59:54] creates a perfect faith heavenly father
[1:59:57] [Music]
