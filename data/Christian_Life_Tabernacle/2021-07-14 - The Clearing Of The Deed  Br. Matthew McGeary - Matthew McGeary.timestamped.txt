[34:13] this saturday so we hope you brothers

[34:20] can just play something as we approach
[34:22] the lord
[34:26] lord jesus
[34:31] thank you for calvary
[34:36] lord there's many songs that have been
[34:38] written and penned
[34:40] about the blood that you shed lord
[34:44] truly lord we're just doing our best to
[34:47] express
[34:48] in this mortal tongue the power
[34:52] the grace the cleansing power the love
[34:55] that you showed to us lord but
[34:58] oh god something in our heart is longing
[35:00] to
[35:02] cross over jordan something in us is
[35:05] longing for sweet beulah land
[35:09] something in his lungs to see you lord
[35:11] face to face
[35:15] and then and only then lord maybe we can
[35:17] really truly start to
[35:20] understand the depths as we believe lord
[35:23] it'll take eternity for us to
[35:25] search out all your riches lord
[35:28] something in our heart longs for that
[35:30] day
[35:31] but we just trust that tonight would
[35:33] just be another step
[35:34] in that direction lord that you could
[35:37] just come by and break the bread of life
[35:39] lord and minister to the needs
[35:40] of your brine lord we're a needy
[35:44] people as long as we're on this side
[35:46] lord we have afflictions in our body we
[35:48] have
[35:49] questions lord we have needs and we're
[35:52] so thankful to know that you're still
[35:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[35:56] that you are our healer that you
[35:59] are the dissolver of doubts lord that
[36:01] you're still breaking the bread of life
[36:03] and distributing it to your people
[36:05] so we just commit the service now to you
[36:07] and ask all these things in your name
[36:09] the lord jesus christ
[36:11] amen praise the lord if you have your
[36:12] bibles let's
[36:14] be reading a few places we'll just start
[36:16] in genesis chapter 2.
[36:22] thank you musicians
[36:33] genesis chapter 2 will read
[36:36] verse 16 and 17.
[36:40] maybe we'll just start with 15 there it
[36:42] says in the lord god took the man
[36:44] and put him into the garden of eden to
[36:46] dress it and to keep it
[36:49] and the lord god commanded the man
[36:50] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[36:53] mayest freely eat
[36:54] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[36:57] and evil
[36:58] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[37:01] that thou eat us thereof thou
[37:03] shalt surely die amen you may have your
[37:07] seats we just pray a blessing on the
[37:09] reading of the word and we just
[37:10] also want to read out of romans 8 11.
[37:23] says but if the spirit of him that
[37:25] raised jesus christ
[37:27] from the dead dwell in you
[37:31] he that raised up christ from the dead
[37:33] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[37:35] the spirit
[37:36] that dwelleth in you and let's just also
[37:39] read out of revelations chapter one
[37:55] verse 17 and 18
[37:58] says and when i saw him i fell at his
[38:01] feet
[38:02] as dead and he laid his right hand upon
[38:06] me saying unto me
[38:07] fear not for i am the first
[38:11] and the last i am he that liveth
[38:15] and was dead and behold
[38:18] i am alive forevermore
[38:21] amen and have the keys of hell
[38:24] and of death
[38:27] i think maybe we could just stop right
[38:29] there and we could have us a little
[38:31] jubilee amen to think that god had given
[38:35] his word there in genesis
[38:37] and he told adam he said the day you eat
[38:40] thereof
[38:41] that day you shall surely die
[38:44] and you look over here into revelations
[38:47] and you'll find that here is one
[38:48] standing
[38:49] because now the penalty of sin upon man
[38:52] was the day you eat thereof that day
[38:55] you shall die but we look over here into
[38:57] the book of revelations and it's now
[38:59] saying that
[39:00] i am he that liveth and was dead
[39:04] that's a very crucial part of that
[39:07] statement
[39:08] because it took one that could have
[39:10] power to lay his life
[39:12] down but also power to take his life
[39:15] up again so here is the very one the
[39:18] very kinsman redeemer standing there and
[39:21] saying
[39:21] oh yes that penalty of sin that was
[39:23] given back there
[39:25] when it said in the day that you eat
[39:26] thereof that day you shall
[39:28] surely die well he's standing there and
[39:30] say yes
[39:31] i am alive and i was dead
[39:34] i paid the penalty of sin but i am alive
[39:38] forevermore and we just want to read a
[39:40] quote here out of the easter
[39:42] seal just to maybe glean a little out of
[39:45] this
[39:46] here we don't think we'll be long
[39:48] tonight but
[39:50] uh just reading out of the easter seal
[39:52] paragraph 101
[39:54] might be a little lengthy reading but it
[39:57] says now
[39:57] they go up to the day of pentecost to
[40:00] receive their abstract
[40:02] do you know what an abstract is is when
[40:05] a deed has been cleared
[40:08] they went up there to receive their
[40:10] abstract
[40:11] and they become quickened oh what a
[40:15] thrill
[40:15] they had bit they had
[40:19] they had bought the land been bought for
[40:22] them
[40:22] they had received it is that true or not
[40:24] we see him raised up
[40:26] but now what about us we are witnesses
[40:29] we stood and seen the man crucified we
[40:32] seen the clouds come over the earth and
[40:34] the darkened skies
[40:35] and the earthquake it shook and had
[40:38] nervous prostrations and
[40:39] they put him in the grave they speared
[40:41] him in the heart with the spear
[40:43] and they took his body down and laid it
[40:45] in the grave of joseph
[40:47] armathea and then they find out that on
[40:50] the third day
[40:51] he raised up again and as the disciple
[40:54] said we are
[40:55] witnesses of this we've seen him raise
[40:58] up
[40:59] we know he is alive
[41:02] now what did that do that took all the
[41:06] fear out
[41:07] no wonder jesus said fear not i
[41:11] am he that was dead and is alive
[41:13] forevermore
[41:15] see it taken all the fear out when they
[41:17] did that
[41:18] now but when they went up to pentecost
[41:21] there they received the quickening power
[41:24] the power that made them alive now
[41:27] there's where i think that you
[41:29] presbyterian and methodist brethren
[41:31] you do receive potentially on believing
[41:34] on the lord jesus christ
[41:35] but the abstract hasn't come yet
[41:39] that's the clearing of the deed god gave
[41:42] abraham a promise
[41:44] abraham believed god and it was imputed
[41:47] unto him for righteousness but he sealed
[41:49] the covenant
[41:50] by the seal of circumcision
[41:53] and god gives you a promise potentially
[41:56] that you will receive it
[41:57] and you're going to be raised up this
[42:00] body is going to be glorified with him
[42:03] at the end time but you see you have to
[42:07] get
[42:07] clearance on that deed so maybe that's
[42:10] what i'm just uh
[42:11] something that was illuminated to me uh
[42:14] brother branham
[42:15] was saying to those presbyterian and
[42:16] those methodists he said you're
[42:18] potentially believing on the lord jesus
[42:19] christ but the abstract hasn't come yet
[42:22] he said that's the clearing of the deed
[42:25] so he's saying here that you have to get
[42:27] a clearance on that deed
[42:28] and the clearance is when everything
[42:31] against him
[42:32] maybe i could say it like this is when
[42:34] everything against you
[42:35] has been stricken off and you got the
[42:38] abstract to it you've got the seal it's
[42:41] yours
[42:42] and everything that is on it belongs to
[42:45] you
[42:46] oh my i just in reading that i say well
[42:48] whatever it is i want the abstract
[42:50] oh i want everything to be stricken off
[42:53] i want all the promise of god everything
[42:55] that's in the word of god
[42:56] oh i want it it's mine i say it's for
[42:58] you
[42:59] but see we have to have the clearing of
[43:02] the deed
[43:03] well maybe there's there's those of us
[43:05] that are sitting here and you're like
[43:06] well brother matthew
[43:09] what does that even mean hearing the
[43:12] abstract title deed and the clearing of
[43:14] the deed and
[43:15] he sent down the abstract and and or the
[43:18] title deed of redemption
[43:21] well that's a good question maybe we'll
[43:23] just take a few moments and
[43:25] and walk through the scriptures and
[43:27] maybe walk through a few things and
[43:28] we'll try to just
[43:29] uh uh by god's grace be illuminated here
[43:33] as we find out in genesis as we would
[43:35] read uh
[43:36] our text is uh now here in genesis 1
[43:39] 27 it would say so god created man
[43:43] in his own image in the image of god
[43:47] created he him now now that was a holy
[43:50] image
[43:52] now when you look in the mirror that is
[43:53] not the image that the scripture is
[43:55] speaking of right now
[43:57] uh don't don't think that when god
[43:59] created man in his image no but this is
[44:01] just a
[44:01] shadow of that that was a holy image
[44:04] that god had created him into male and
[44:07] female created he them
[44:09] and god blessed them and god said unto
[44:10] them be fruitful and multiply and
[44:13] replenish the earth and subdue it
[44:15] and have dominion over the fish of the
[44:17] sea
[44:18] and over the fowl of the air and over
[44:20] every living thing that moveth
[44:23] upon the earth so you you see here that
[44:26] this dominion over the earth this
[44:28] eternal life
[44:30] this image of god that that adam was
[44:33] made in this was perfection
[44:35] this was god's doing and it was good
[44:38] that god would create man in in he would
[44:41] um adam was
[44:43] was like a god upon the earth he he had
[44:46] the power of the spoken word and
[44:48] you know if he maybe wanted to move
[44:49] something this way or that way
[44:52] adam had full control for adam had
[44:54] dominion over the earth
[44:56] he was a god of the earth and that was
[44:59] that was what god had created him to be
[45:02] but something is going to happen where
[45:04] adam is going to lose this position
[45:07] and this image and position that he had
[45:10] with god there in the beginning
[45:12] so as we just move through our scripture
[45:14] we look into first timothy 2 14
[45:17] as we're just trying to to catch a
[45:19] little grasp of adam here
[45:21] uh timothy would write there in verse
[45:23] 14. he'd say and adam
[45:24] was not deceived but the woman being
[45:28] deceived was in the transgression
[45:30] and the prophet of god would say it like
[45:32] this out of the church age book he would
[45:34] say that adam sold
[45:36] the human race into sin that he might
[45:38] have eve
[45:39] for he loved her so adam was not in the
[45:44] transgression adam was not deceived
[45:46] but adam was now mirroring the very
[45:48] heart purpose of god
[45:50] to be a redeemer that by love the very
[45:53] one that he loved he would take on
[45:55] sinful flesh
[45:57] knowing that he would have to suffer the
[45:59] penalty of death
[46:00] and die so in doing that we know that
[46:03] adam had lost his dominion and his
[46:05] position
[46:06] that god had given to him and what had
[46:09] happened there now is what it did is it
[46:10] allowed for satan to come in now
[46:13] satan's going to start to come into the
[46:15] earth and he's going to start to pervert
[46:17] he's going to start to destroy he's
[46:19] going to bring death upon the earth
[46:22] and now this holy image this holy veil
[46:25] that was upon man
[46:26] now as lost adam and eve walked out of
[46:29] the garden of eden they no longer have
[46:31] that fellowship with god
[46:33] and now all of a sudden there's stickers
[46:34] and there's briars and there's things
[46:36] starting to pop
[46:37] up that was never intended to be there
[46:40] but
[46:40] lucifer that that angel that had fallen
[46:43] that wanted to exalt himself
[46:44] above god he wanted to be like god he
[46:47] wanted to be worshipped as god
[46:48] and now that great perverter now he he's
[46:51] bringing death
[46:52] and destruction upon mankind
[46:55] uh uh recently i was at a customer's
[46:58] house and
[46:58] and we were just looking at some trees
[47:00] to do a bit and this little puppy was
[47:02] trying to follow us along and
[47:04] and i i couldn't help but notice this
[47:06] this little uh
[47:07] puppy was just you know kind of a it was
[47:09] a little odd guy
[47:10] he he you know he was just kind of uh
[47:13] twisted to the side and his head was
[47:14] looked back and
[47:16] and we got to talking and the puppy was
[47:18] born with some type of disease his body
[47:20] was all
[47:21] i twisted up he couldn't uh really i
[47:23] used his back
[47:24] back legs but he but he was a little uh
[47:27] a miniature um
[47:29] sheepdog i'm trying to remember the the
[47:32] the name of those type of dogs uh
[47:34] uh oh help me out no it was
[47:38] haley just sold a couple of them yeah
[47:41] it's a mini australian shepherd oh and
[47:43] it had the gray little hair on it and
[47:45] the blue eyes and everything
[47:47] and it just oh it just had a smile on
[47:49] its
[47:50] face and it was all happy and everything
[47:52] and i just looked at it
[47:53] and something in my heart i just was
[47:55] vexed because
[47:56] here this puppy was it was just so
[47:58] bright but yet it was in a crippled
[48:00] condition
[48:01] and i just i just looked at that dog and
[48:04] i just thought to myself oh my
[48:06] don't worry it won't be it won't be very
[48:08] long
[48:11] it won't be very long that that you're
[48:14] going to have to suffer in these
[48:15] conditions
[48:16] it's not going to be very long that
[48:17] mankind has to continue
[48:19] uh to have to put up with this
[48:20] perversion and this sickness
[48:22] and this death that has has been thrown
[48:25] down upon man because of the burden and
[48:27] curse of sin
[48:31] and we find out that god had told adam
[48:33] there in genesis 1
[48:34] 28 he said multiply
[48:37] and replenish the earth now the prophet
[48:40] of god would point this out in marriage
[48:42] and divorce he would say that was to be
[48:44] fulfilled by spirit
[48:45] spiritual multiplication it was not to
[48:48] be by sex or by sexual desire
[48:51] that this commission or this this word
[48:54] that god had given to adam would be
[48:56] fulfilled
[48:56] but it was to be by a spiritual
[48:58] multiplication by the word
[49:01] so now that adam when he had come to
[49:04] wife and and and she had
[49:05] she had uh uh uh uh been impregnated by
[49:08] the serpent we find out
[49:10] that eve had swapped the word of god for
[49:12] personal knowledge
[49:14] and what it did is it now left this
[49:16] promise or this commission of god here
[49:18] in genesis 1 28 it left it unfulfilled
[49:21] he said be be fruitful and multiply and
[49:24] replenish the earth
[49:25] but the replenishing of the earth that
[49:27] adam had done
[49:28] was not in a holy image it was not
[49:31] in the image of god because even when
[49:33] you pick it up in genesis 5
[49:35] you'll find out that that that the
[49:37] scriptures would say that
[49:38] adam bore seth and he born bore a son in
[49:41] his own image
[49:42] it was in in his likeness and what image
[49:45] and likeness was adam in
[49:46] adam was in a fallen nature he was in a
[49:49] fallen condition
[49:50] he no longer had dominion over the earth
[49:52] that was not
[49:53] the the multiplication that god had had
[49:56] in mind
[49:57] but when he had given the commission to
[49:59] adam he wanted to bring forth many
[50:01] sons of god into manifestation in the
[50:04] same very
[50:05] image of god with the power of the
[50:07] spoken word
[50:08] that's what he wanted to do but he lost
[50:11] this he lost
[50:12] uh uh that holy image and so now this
[50:14] genesis 1 28
[50:16] it's just left laying there it's left
[50:18] there uh unfulfilled
[50:20] because eve had swapped the word for
[50:22] personal knowledge
[50:23] you say well brother matthew what do you
[50:25] mean that even swapped the word for
[50:27] personal knowledge well i'm just quoting
[50:29] the prophet
[50:33] but i want to maybe make an emphasis
[50:35] here as the prophet many times would i
[50:37] want to i want you to know
[50:39] that the womb of your spirit is your
[50:41] mind
[50:43] this is very poor important for us to to
[50:46] maybe
[50:47] uh uh uh dwell upon for a few moments
[50:49] here the womb
[50:50] of your spirit is your mind and the
[50:53] prophet of god said your mind is a
[50:55] channel
[50:56] and so we know that what had happened is
[50:59] the serpent
[51:00] or the most subtle beast in the field
[51:02] was able to beguile eve
[51:04] and and start to give her reason and
[51:07] reason her away
[51:09] from the word of god and where did eve
[51:12] first
[51:12] conceive before the physical act was
[51:17] ever committed eve first conceived in
[51:21] her mind
[51:22] then it was in the conception of her
[51:24] mind which is the womb of the spirit
[51:27] that she re received that lie of the
[51:30] devil
[51:31] and then upon believing that lie of the
[51:34] devil
[51:34] and allowing that seed to come into the
[51:36] womb of her mind
[51:38] now that it had taken root there that it
[51:41] brought forth the physical act
[51:45] now this isn't just a history lesson
[51:48] this isn't just a story for us to
[51:50] understand
[51:51] uh uh uh uh just in one facet of what
[51:53] happened back out there in eden
[51:55] but it's very important for each one of
[51:57] us to understand
[51:58] that satan is trying to attack you the
[52:01] very same way today
[52:02] the very same way tonight he's trying to
[52:04] attack your mind
[52:09] you wonder why you you're not getting
[52:10] the victory you want
[52:12] you wonder why you're not getting total
[52:14] deliverance
[52:16] because you're allowing the womb of your
[52:19] spirit
[52:20] to take on seed that when lust or sin is
[52:23] conceived that it bringeth forth death
[52:26] and you're seeing the very manifestation
[52:28] of the seeds of lady asea or satan's
[52:31] eating
[52:32] as you continue to feed on those things
[52:35] you're starting to see those weeds and
[52:37] those things popping up
[52:38] in your life and you wonder how it got
[52:40] there
[52:41] that's because you're allowing these
[52:43] seeds to be sown into the womb
[52:45] of your mind which is your spirit
[52:51] we have a responsibility to possess
[52:54] these vessels in sanctification and
[52:56] honor
[52:56] the scripture would say along these
[52:58] lines don't you know
[53:00] that whatever you yield your members to
[53:03] right that's to whatever you yield to
[53:06] that's whose servant you are
[53:08] so if you're going to continue to yield
[53:10] yourself
[53:11] as a servant unto unrighteousness if
[53:14] you're going to continue to yield
[53:15] yourself look
[53:16] i i we don't have to go down all the
[53:18] channels but i can say this as a
[53:20] a son and daughter of god you know that
[53:22] the things that you're doing and the
[53:24] things that you're feeding on
[53:25] if it's not promoting and propagating a
[53:29] spiritual life
[53:30] and a spiritual atmosphere where you're
[53:32] in one heart and one accord
[53:34] and you're just walking in the spirit
[53:36] and you're walking in the channel with
[53:38] the lord
[53:38] like adam would have been walking there
[53:41] in the garden of eden when the god would
[53:43] come down in the cool of the eden
[53:44] oh if you're not feeding on things that
[53:46] would nurture that relationship
[53:48] i wonder what are you feeding on what
[53:51] are you yielding your members to
[53:53] and you wonder what happens because
[53:55] you've allowed seed to come into your
[53:57] mind
[53:58] and that is the womb of your spirit and
[53:59] all of a sudden you wonder why your
[54:01] spirit is defiled
[54:02] it's because you've yielded your members
[54:04] to unrighteousness
[54:07] oh so we we we we want to yield
[54:10] ourselves
[54:11] to the word that's as we're reading here
[54:14] in the easter seal the prophet would say
[54:16] oh oh that the word he wants to quicken
[54:19] your mind
[54:20] i say oh god quickened my mind are
[54:23] quickened me away from the things of the
[54:25] world
[54:25] quicken me away from the knowledge of
[54:27] the world quicken me away from the
[54:28] education of the world
[54:30] quicken me away from the entertainment
[54:31] of the world quicken me away from all
[54:33] those things lord
[54:34] may i have a single eye for you and you
[54:36] alone
[54:38] oh may we be like rebecca may we be able
[54:41] to look at our houses and our lands
[54:43] and everything that we ever thought oh
[54:45] that would be ours maybe as an
[54:47] inheritance or maybe
[54:48] we looked out on the land we thought we
[54:50] would go here or go to this school or go
[54:52] to that job or have this career but when
[54:54] something came beckoning
[54:56] oh and that eleazar call came
[54:59] something inside of rebecca oh it was a
[55:02] time of decision
[55:03] she said oh i will make my decision i
[55:06] will go i have a single heart
[55:08] that i will go be united with my
[55:10] bridegroom
[55:11] oh i pray o god that is the bride of
[55:13] jesus christ we'll come and touch us
[55:16] such a singleness of heart that we'll be
[55:18] so
[55:19] uh uh uh fetch by lady osea
[55:22] will be so vexed by the atmospheres that
[55:24] satan's eden
[55:25] is producing i wonder when the last time
[55:28] you went into a restaurant with the last
[55:31] time that you went into
[55:33] a maybe a public venue where's the last
[55:36] time you got around
[55:37] with those ungodly people and you felt
[55:39] nervous in your spirit
[55:42] oh i wonder the reason why we don't feel
[55:43] nervous in our spirit
[55:45] is because we're getting lulled to sleep
[55:47] we're just getting a little comfortable
[55:49] hearing ladies say it
[55:50] it just ain't too bad to rub shoulders
[55:52] with the people the people of the world
[55:56] oh but i tell you if you've ever gotten
[55:57] an atmosphere of prayer
[55:59] if you've ever come into the presence of
[56:01] god and you're walking and you're
[56:03] in communion with him and you've been
[56:04] fellowshipping with him and the word of
[56:06] god is breaking to you
[56:07] oh and you've been such a surrender to
[56:09] prayer and all of a sudden you go out
[56:10] into a restaurant you're going to feel a
[56:12] little
[56:12] awkward yes sir you're going to feel
[56:15] like i really don't belong here
[56:18] very good i say oh god help us
[56:22] to to strive to live in that atmosphere
[56:27] and in that presence where we're not
[56:29] yielding
[56:30] our mind and our members to
[56:32] unrighteousness
[56:34] so as we're moving through here we find
[56:36] out that adam was willing to take on sin
[56:39] to redeem his wife
[56:42] and now this right to eternal life this
[56:45] right to
[56:46] dominion this title deed what happened
[56:50] to it
[56:52] we're trying to answer the question you
[56:54] say oh brother matthew you keep saying
[56:56] the clearing of the deed what was this
[56:57] title d well
[56:58] you see man was made in the image of god
[57:02] he was made to have dominion over the
[57:04] earth
[57:05] he was made to have eternal life and to
[57:08] live forever
[57:09] and that possession that mankind was
[57:12] given by god that adam had possession of
[57:16] he lost that possession because of sin
[57:19] so he no longer was in possession of
[57:22] that
[57:23] title deed and that deed now had a lien
[57:26] or a debt on it because the word said
[57:30] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[57:32] and so now adam has lost
[57:34] his holy image he has lost his dominion
[57:36] he has lost his position
[57:38] in god and now we find him uh
[57:41] in this place of a fallen state
[57:44] and picking up out of the breach we'll
[57:46] read here
[57:50] the title deed to eternal life
[57:53] abstract title deed to eternal life
[57:56] when adam forfeited it for wisdom
[58:00] instead of faith it went back
[58:03] in the hands of the almighty god
[58:07] what a thing all right waiting
[58:11] what's it doing it's in the hands of god
[58:16] waiting for redemption
[58:19] claims now if we can pick up in our
[58:22] bibles and we'll look here in
[58:23] revelations chapter 5
[58:25] as the prophet is pointing out here what
[58:28] is this book doing now
[58:30] it is in the hands of god waiting for
[58:32] redemption
[58:33] claims and as we read out of revelations
[58:36] 5 1
[58:36] here it will say and i saw in the right
[58:41] hand of him
[58:42] that sat on the throne a book written
[58:45] within
[58:46] and on the backside sealed with
[58:49] seven seals and as the prophet would go
[58:52] on he'd say in john in the spirit
[58:55] standing up here in heaven he's just
[58:57] been lifted up now from the church ages
[58:59] see
[59:00] i saw the church ages and then he was
[59:03] taken up in the fourth chapter he said
[59:05] come
[59:05] up higher i'm going to show you things
[59:09] that will come and he saw one sitting
[59:12] upon the throne
[59:14] with this book in his hand in his right
[59:17] hand
[59:18] think of it now and then in this
[59:21] book was the title deed to redemption
[59:24] and it was sealed with seven seals
[59:28] this is a book of redemption now what
[59:31] does redeem mean
[59:34] redeem means to be brought back or to
[59:37] buy back
[59:38] or to bring back to the original
[59:42] owner so then god has a plan
[59:46] that now that adam man that was
[59:49] made in his image had lost
[59:52] that holy image he had lost that
[59:56] title deed so god now is going to redeem
[1:00:01] it back to the original
[1:00:04] owner look when god had given it to adam
[1:00:08] he intended for adam to keep it
[1:00:12] but adam lost it so now god by his
[1:00:15] oh by his wonderful plan of redemption
[1:00:19] was going to make a way that he would
[1:00:21] redeem it back to man again
[1:00:25] oh we find ourselves looking into this
[1:00:28] scripture here
[1:00:29] as this book now is in the hand of him
[1:00:32] that sat upon the throne
[1:00:34] but adam couldn't redeem it adam needed
[1:00:37] him
[1:00:37] he needed redemption himself the day you
[1:00:41] eat thereof that day you die and ever
[1:00:42] since that day every man or woman that's
[1:00:44] ever come on the face of the earth
[1:00:48] would be borne by sexual desire
[1:00:51] and so now there's going to be an angel
[1:00:53] proclaiming who is worthy to open the
[1:00:55] book
[1:00:57] who is worthy to to look thereon or
[1:00:59] loose the seals
[1:01:00] and the prophet of god would dramatize
[1:01:02] this any breach he'd say well there was
[1:01:04] moses standing there
[1:01:06] there was elijah standing there there
[1:01:08] was all of the prophets that standing
[1:01:10] there there was the apostles standing
[1:01:12] there
[1:01:12] and oh he looked into heaven he looked
[1:01:15] under the earth and there was nobody
[1:01:17] found worthy
[1:01:18] to open the book
[1:01:21] well that's why we'll find in romans 3
[1:01:23] 23 paul would write
[1:01:25] for all have sinned and
[1:01:28] all come short of the glory
[1:01:32] of god no man had possessed the glory of
[1:01:36] god
[1:01:36] and was righteous enough or could escape
[1:01:39] that penalty and that curse of sin that
[1:01:42] they would be a
[1:01:43] thoughtless sin sacrifice
[1:01:47] that would be able to pay the penalty of
[1:01:49] sin and would even have the power to lay
[1:01:51] their life
[1:01:52] down and power to take it up again oh
[1:01:54] there was no one in heaven
[1:01:56] there was no one in earth
[1:02:01] david would say in psalms 51 5 you say
[1:02:03] behold
[1:02:04] i was shaping and iniquity and in sin
[1:02:08] did my mother conceive me
[1:02:11] oh because of this original sin act
[1:02:14] every man and every woman that was ever
[1:02:17] born by sexual desire is subject
[1:02:20] to the law of sin and death
[1:02:23] subject to the curse of sin
[1:02:26] subject to bondage
[1:02:30] so i will find paul writing here in
[1:02:32] romans 7 24
[1:02:35] it's all wretched man that i am
[1:02:38] who shall deliver me from this body of
[1:02:41] death
[1:02:42] i wonder if anybody's ever felt like
[1:02:45] paul
[1:02:46] what i would do good evil is present
[1:02:48] with me oh what i would i would i try to
[1:02:50] do good i can't do it
[1:02:52] and when i go to do good i make a
[1:02:54] mistake oh you feel so
[1:02:56] beat up and you just feel so cash down
[1:02:58] you feel like i'm i'm never good enough
[1:02:59] and
[1:03:00] and i've been trying over and over and
[1:03:01] over again it just seems like i can
[1:03:03] never get it right
[1:03:04] oh wretched man that i am who shall
[1:03:08] deliver me
[1:03:09] from this body of death
[1:03:13] first john 2 16 would write
[1:03:17] for all that's in the world
[1:03:20] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:03:23] eyes
[1:03:25] and the pride of life
[1:03:28] is not of the father but is of the world
[1:03:33] oh my i that starts to make me feel
[1:03:37] guilty
[1:03:38] that makes me start to question who i am
[1:03:42] and where i came from and to know my
[1:03:45] faults and my failures and my past
[1:03:47] and it says for all that is in the world
[1:03:51] well that's the only this is our
[1:03:54] you know that's the we've been given
[1:03:56] five senses to contact
[1:03:58] our earthly ole miss the only thing
[1:03:59] we've ever known
[1:04:02] oh my you just could you could try to
[1:04:04] think back to your earliest
[1:04:06] earliest memory maybe some can think
[1:04:09] back further than others maybe you can
[1:04:11] think back to two years old
[1:04:12] maybe you can think back to three years
[1:04:14] old maybe you could think back to four
[1:04:16] years old
[1:04:17] but but that's as far as you can go
[1:04:20] and so when you you look at your your
[1:04:22] memory and you look at your life
[1:04:24] and you look at your senses that have
[1:04:26] been given to you to contact your
[1:04:27] earthly home
[1:04:28] and your mind and your memory you say oh
[1:04:30] you look at the scripture it says for
[1:04:31] all that is in the world
[1:04:34] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:04:35] eyes and the pride of life is not of the
[1:04:37] father
[1:04:38] but as of the world and something in you
[1:04:40] says well
[1:04:41] i'm pretty worldly i've done a lot of
[1:04:44] bad things
[1:04:47] but i i i just want to maybe share some
[1:04:50] good news tonight
[1:04:52] i i want to maybe preach the gospel the
[1:04:55] good news
[1:04:56] but i want to say this yes by your first
[1:04:59] birth
[1:05:00] naturally you are of the world
[1:05:05] but i want to tell you tonight that is
[1:05:07] not where you originated
[1:05:09] you did not originate by sin you did not
[1:05:13] originate by a natural birth
[1:05:16] that might be the only ability in your
[1:05:18] mind and in this body to contact
[1:05:21] your earthly home but i want to point
[1:05:23] you to the prophet of god out of the
[1:05:24] easter seal in chapter in
[1:05:26] in paragraph 62 if they can maybe pull
[1:05:29] that up
[1:05:30] but remember
[1:05:36] the stature that you are in this morning
[1:05:41] if you wasn't in his thinking then
[1:05:45] you're not now
[1:05:48] for you for there's some part that's in
[1:05:52] you
[1:05:54] i'll just read it again they'll get
[1:05:56] there eventually if anybody's back there
[1:05:58] there they are
[1:05:59] all right we're there paragraph 62 but
[1:06:02] remember
[1:06:03] the stature that you are in this morning
[1:06:05] if you wasn't
[1:06:06] in his thinking then you're not now
[1:06:11] oh well yeah that devil's trying to
[1:06:13] whisper in your ear
[1:06:14] tell the devil to shut up just go on and
[1:06:17] tell him he's the
[1:06:18] father of lies and the very reason why
[1:06:20] he keeps trying to highlight these parts
[1:06:22] to you
[1:06:22] because he's afraid that when you catch
[1:06:24] the revelation
[1:06:25] you're going to be like a house on fire
[1:06:27] on a windy day
[1:06:28] and doom devils are going to be on the
[1:06:30] run you might as well just
[1:06:32] accept who you are you might as well
[1:06:34] just finally
[1:06:35] give in quit feeding on the things of
[1:06:38] the world and give in to who you really
[1:06:40] are quit being a hypocrite

[1:07:01] full potential
[1:07:02] but remember the statue that you're in
[1:07:04] this morning if you wasn't in this
[1:07:05] thinking then you're not now for you
[1:07:08] there's some part that's in you that's
[1:07:11] eternal
[1:07:13] and eternal only
[1:07:16] belongs to god
[1:07:20] there there's some part that's in you
[1:07:22] that's eternal
[1:07:23] and eternal only belongs to god look you
[1:07:26] don't belong to sin
[1:07:28] you don't belong to the world you don't

[1:07:54] beginning
[1:07:55] and eternal only belongs to god
[1:07:59] that means you belong to god you're
[1:08:01] god's property
[1:08:03] i say devil take your hands off of god's

[1:08:38] struggle the reason why you continue to
[1:08:40] battle
[1:08:40] the reason why you can't figure out what
[1:08:42] you want to do with your life because
[1:08:43] you haven't fully surrendered to him
[1:08:46] you want to look at fully surrendered oh
[1:08:49] my there were some apostles when they
[1:08:50] got that quickening power
[1:08:52] they weren't out there trying to get
[1:08:53] educated they weren't out there trying
[1:08:55] to
[1:08:55] build a bigger house they were dropping
[1:08:57] out of their school they were selling
[1:08:59] their house
[1:09:00] they had all things in common look up
[1:09:02] your redemption josh nine
[1:09:05] quickening power it took all the fear
[1:09:08] out of their life
[1:09:08] you're so afraid of how you're gonna
[1:09:11] make ends meet
[1:09:12] you're so afraid if you can pay for your
[1:09:14] college tuition you're so afraid if
[1:09:16] you're gonna be able to pay the bills
[1:09:17] oh get that quickening power it'll take
[1:09:20] all the fear out of you
[1:09:23] oh hallelujah i'm not talking about a
[1:09:27] beat down
[1:09:28] a spineless church i'm talking about the
[1:09:31] church
[1:09:31] of the living god that's filled with
[1:09:33] that same zoe life
[1:09:36] the same one that stood there and said i
[1:09:38] am he
[1:09:40] i am alive i was dead
[1:09:44] but i'm alive forever more i would ask
[1:09:46] you where is he
[1:09:48] tonight in you in you
[1:09:51] and you what are you afraid of
[1:09:56] oh hallelujah let hell rage
[1:09:59] unless satan didn't come you're going to
[1:10:02] put every single one of them devils
[1:10:03] under your feet
[1:10:04] that's what you're here for glory
[1:10:08] hallelujah you don't belong to the world
[1:10:14] you belong to god you're god's property
[1:10:21] oh you just bypassed your theophany
[1:10:24] you become a flesh man to be tempted of
[1:10:27] sin
[1:10:29] that's what the prophet said out of who
[1:10:30] is this melchizedek
[1:10:32] you just showed up in a fallen nature
[1:10:34] here
[1:10:38] oh and a debt you couldn't pay
[1:10:42] that's why jesus would say in john 3 6
[1:10:47] he would say that which is born of the
[1:10:49] flesh is flesh
[1:10:51] and that which is born of the spirit of
[1:10:53] spirit
[1:10:54] my will not that i said unto you
[1:10:58] ye must be born
[1:11:02] again i want to say the same calls going
[1:11:05] out tonight
[1:11:07] you must be born
[1:11:10] again young children
[1:11:14] you've been baptized you've done well
[1:11:19] you must be born again
[1:11:23] you're not too young to start craving
[1:11:27] and hungering and thirsting for
[1:11:30] righteousness to be fulfilled in your
[1:11:31] life
[1:11:32] parents you wonder why things have been
[1:11:34] so difficult around the house lately
[1:11:38] that's because yes your children have
[1:11:39] been baptized
[1:11:42] and the devil knows that there's a
[1:11:45] soldier that's arising in the ranks
[1:11:48] that is called to tear his kingdom down
[1:11:53] called to go in a rapture called to go
[1:11:56] on a body change
[1:11:58] and now he's fighting against your home
[1:12:02] he's fighting against your children
[1:12:05] he's fighting against the unity in your
[1:12:08] home
[1:12:09] i say as a word of the lord bind closer
[1:12:11] together than you've ever been bound
[1:12:13] before
[1:12:15] that little division in the home make it
[1:12:17] right
[1:12:18] children get along with your siblings
[1:12:21] parents don't grieve your children
[1:12:25] let's let that love of god
[1:12:29] dominate the atmosphere in our home
[1:12:33] for paul would say well just
[1:12:37] fellowshipping on that just a little bit
[1:12:38] longer
[1:12:40] you must be born again
[1:12:44] but i want to make this statement that
[1:12:46] it's only the seed of god that can be
[1:12:48] reborn
[1:12:50] for the prophet would say out of the
[1:12:51] church age book he'd say we did not
[1:12:53] become seed by the rebirth
[1:12:56] we were seed and therefore
[1:12:59] were reborn for
[1:13:03] only the elect can be
[1:13:06] reborn now we don't need to try to get
[1:13:09] out onto a lot of doctrine
[1:13:11] many times we accept people's
[1:13:14] definitions
[1:13:15] we accept their profession but we have
[1:13:18] been properly taught we know the word
[1:13:20] a lot of people profess that they've
[1:13:23] been saved
[1:13:24] or they've been born again but they have
[1:13:26] no quickening power
[1:13:28] they have not the life of our lord on
[1:13:31] display
[1:13:32] to prove that they got the goods
[1:13:36] and i say not as conviction or to
[1:13:38] condemn anybody
[1:13:40] but being that you are a seed of god you
[1:13:42] are
[1:13:43] his elect there is greater potential and
[1:13:46] manifestation
[1:13:47] for the spirit of god in your life and
[1:13:50] what we want to do
[1:13:51] church is we we want to spread out a
[1:13:53] little bit
[1:13:56] we don't want to get complacent but we
[1:13:58] we want to start to have dominion over
[1:14:01] the things that god has given us
[1:14:04] we can't be wishy-washy we can't be
[1:14:07] wishy-washy with our time we can't be
[1:14:09] wishy-washy with our family
[1:14:11] we can't be wishy-washy with our job we
[1:14:13] can't be wishy washy
[1:14:14] was jesus christ ever wishy-washy
[1:14:19] then we're called to make a stand in
[1:14:21] this hour
[1:14:22] to redeem the time romans 9 15 would
[1:14:26] read for he saith to moses
[1:14:29] i will have mercy on whom i will have
[1:14:31] mercy
[1:14:33] and i will have compassion on whom i
[1:14:34] will have compassion
[1:14:37] so then it is not of him that willeth
[1:14:41] nor of him that runneth but of
[1:14:44] god that showeth mercy
[1:14:48] i want to ask you this question and
[1:14:50] maybe
[1:14:51] it doesn't require an answer but just
[1:14:54] for thought when did god show you mercy
[1:14:58] when did god show you mercy
[1:15:01] as i uh pondered that question as it
[1:15:04] came to my heart
[1:15:05] when did god show you mercy and that
[1:15:09] scripture came to my heart
[1:15:11] there in revelations 13 it says
[1:15:14] he was the lamb slain from the
[1:15:18] foundation
[1:15:19] of the world oh god's mercy was enduring
[1:15:23] for you even
[1:15:24] then way back there before every one
[1:15:28] speck of stardust was ever spoken to
[1:15:31] existence
[1:15:32] he was the lamb slain before the
[1:15:34] foundation of the world god
[1:15:36] was already expressing his love and his
[1:15:39] mercy towards his bride
[1:15:41] his elect the very thoughts that he had
[1:15:43] in his mind and he placed your name on
[1:15:45] the lamb's book of life
[1:15:46] that you could never be lost oh my
[1:15:50] talk about grace talk about mercy
[1:15:54] for romans 5 8 would say but god
[1:15:58] commendeth his love towards us and that
[1:16:01] while we were yet sinners
[1:16:04] christ died for us oh the prophet would
[1:16:08] say it like this that god wrapped
[1:16:09] himself in a blood cell
[1:16:13] he took on sinful flesh
[1:16:16] that he could pay the penalty of sin
[1:16:20] that it could fulfill the law of
[1:16:21] redemption
[1:16:23] well brother matthew what are you
[1:16:24] talking about you're talking about title
[1:16:26] deeds
[1:16:27] you're talking about law of redemption
[1:16:30] well let's just try to cook it down and
[1:16:33] make it real simple
[1:16:36] we can understand that adam had a right
[1:16:38] to
[1:16:39] or adam had possession of
[1:16:43] eternal life and dominion
[1:16:46] over the earth and he was made in the
[1:16:48] image of god
[1:16:50] and he had a holy image
[1:16:53] the word said the day you eat thereof
[1:16:58] that day you die so adam transgressed
[1:17:00] the word of god
[1:17:02] so he lost that position that was given
[1:17:06] to him
[1:17:06] so he no longer has possession of that
[1:17:10] and because god had given it to him it's
[1:17:11] gone back into god's hands
[1:17:13] and now he's holding that title deed in
[1:17:16] his hand
[1:17:17] all right are you with me but now god
[1:17:22] in his great plan leviticus 25
[1:17:26] 25 would say this that if my brother be
[1:17:30] wax and poor and have sold away some of
[1:17:32] his possession
[1:17:33] now now adam sold the human race into
[1:17:36] sin
[1:17:39] so if he had sold away some of his
[1:17:41] possession and if any of his
[1:17:43] can come to redeem it then shall he
[1:17:46] redeem that which
[1:17:47] his brother sold
[1:17:52] oh my that song just comes to me
[1:17:55] he paid a debt he did not owe
[1:18:00] i owed a debt i couldn't pay
[1:18:03] i needed someone to wash
[1:18:07] my sins away i now can sing
[1:18:11] a brand new song amazing grace
[1:18:15] all day long christ
[1:18:18] jesus paid a debt
[1:18:23] that you or i could never pay
[1:18:30] john 1 32 would say this
[1:18:33] just moving along try to
[1:18:37] tie this together it would say and then
[1:18:39] john bare records saying i
[1:18:41] saw the spirit descending from heaven
[1:18:45] like a dove
[1:18:47] and it abode upon him out of the lamb
[1:18:50] and the dove the prophet this is just so
[1:18:52] beautiful i wanted to share this
[1:18:54] he says oh what a confirmation to see
[1:18:57] a lamb and a dove come together
[1:19:00] heaven and earth united
[1:19:04] god and man united until this time
[1:19:09] man was not united there was that great
[1:19:13] chasm that had separated god
[1:19:15] from man but now that that promised word
[1:19:19] that was spoken way back there in
[1:19:21] genesis
[1:19:22] what did it do it found a betting place
[1:19:26] in the virgin mary who said be it unto
[1:19:28] me according to thy word
[1:19:31] and it brought forth the messiah and he
[1:19:34] says oh what a confirmation to see the
[1:19:36] lamb and the dove come together heaven
[1:19:38] and earth united
[1:19:39] god and man united and why the sins of
[1:19:42] the world
[1:19:43] was kissed away and all the roughness
[1:19:46] and all death and all sorrow
[1:19:50] and all sickness was kissed away
[1:19:53] when the lamb and the dove become united
[1:19:57] together
[1:19:58] oh what a kinsman god now
[1:20:01] coming and taking on sinful flesh that
[1:20:04] he might pay that penalty of sin
[1:20:07] what was he doing he was accomplishing
[1:20:11] the work of a kinsmen redeemer
[1:20:13] he was paying the debt that adam
[1:20:15] couldn't pay he was paying the debt that
[1:20:17] moses
[1:20:18] couldn't pay that elijah couldn't pay
[1:20:20] none of them
[1:20:21] could have the power to lay their life
[1:20:23] down and take it up again
[1:20:24] oh what was he coming to do he was
[1:20:26] coming to clear the deed
[1:20:28] for every son and daughter of god he was
[1:20:31] coming to claim back
[1:20:33] everything that adam had lost eternal
[1:20:35] life
[1:20:36] and dominion over the earth and that
[1:20:38] holy image
[1:20:39] now the kinsmen redeemer god now

[1:20:44] sinful flesh has come to fulfill the
[1:20:46] kinsmen redeemer

[1:21:01] in the hands of god waiting for
[1:21:02] redemption claims

[1:21:26] bibles to revelations chapter 5.
[1:21:30] we already read verse 1.
[1:21:43] and i saw a strong angel proclaim me
[1:21:45] with a loud voice
[1:21:49] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:21:52] loose the seals thereof
[1:21:54] and no man in heaven no man in earth
[1:21:59] neither under the earth was able to open
[1:22:02] the book
[1:22:03] neither to look thereon
[1:22:07] and i wept much
[1:22:11] because no man was found worthy to open
[1:22:14] and to read the book neither to look
[1:22:17] thereon
[1:22:20] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[1:22:22] not
[1:22:24] i think this is one of the most sublime
[1:22:26] i believe even brother branham says it
[1:22:27] that way the most sublime
[1:22:28] portion of scripture he says weep not
[1:22:30] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:22:34] the root of david hath prevailed
[1:22:37] to open the book and to loose
[1:22:41] the seven seals thereof
[1:22:44] paragraph 118 out of the breach
[1:22:48] what is this book of redemption
[1:22:52] this title deed abstract title d you say
[1:22:55] abstract
[1:22:56] what does abstract mean it means it
[1:22:59] searched all the way back
[1:23:00] to its beginning like that little drop
[1:23:04] of ink this morning when it struck that
[1:23:05] bleach it went all the way back
[1:23:07] and when sin has been confessed and
[1:23:11] fallen into the blood of jesus christ oh
[1:23:14] my
[1:23:14] it gives an abstract right straight back
[1:23:17] to the creator again

[1:23:22] title deed is held in the hands of
[1:23:23] almighty oh my

[1:23:35] together once it says

[1:24:00] quickening power it's

[1:35:21] it's the guarantee
[1:35:25] that everything was ever held against
[1:35:28] you
[1:35:33] oh thank you jesus
[1:35:36] some of you ain't gone as far as others

[1:35:39] but i think old prostitute girl
[1:35:44] there was a meeting down the road
[1:35:48] simon had called a meeting and there
[1:35:51] were sadducees there and people that had
[1:35:54] invited him just to make fun of him
[1:35:59] but all this ill-famed woman she
[1:36:03] she knew that that was her only chance
[1:36:07] she even thought he'll know where i got
[1:36:09] the money from
[1:36:12] she said that's
[1:36:16] that's my only chance if i could just
[1:36:18] get testy
[1:36:21] and there she washed his feet
[1:36:26] with her tears
[1:36:29] oh my imagine the suspense
[1:36:34] what will he say
[1:36:38] well he rejected me
[1:36:44] and jesus said simon
[1:36:47] i came here
[1:36:50] i came to christian life tabernacle
[1:36:52] tonight
[1:36:56] you didn't greet me you didn't worship
[1:37:00] me you didn't even lift your hand you
[1:37:01] didn't even open your heart
[1:37:04] i was pleading with you i was crying out
[1:37:08] to you
[1:37:10] i was giving you the very words to set
[1:37:12] you free
[1:37:16] but you let the presence of god go
[1:37:18] unrecognized
[1:37:21] but this woman by the time she's got
[1:37:25] here
[1:37:28] she hasn't stopped washing my feet with
[1:37:31] her tears
[1:37:36] and he looked at her and said your sins
[1:37:40] which are many
[1:37:43] i forgive you you are forgiven
[1:37:49] oh if you've never experienced that
[1:37:51] saints
[1:37:53] i don't care if you've grown up in the
[1:37:54] church
[1:37:56] i don't care if you've ever gone out in
[1:37:58] the world
[1:38:00] you meet that kinsman redeemer
[1:38:03] there's a charge laid against your life
[1:38:05] you were born in sin
[1:38:08] there's a claim held against the deed
[1:38:12] for in that book of life everything you
[1:38:15] ever thought of is recorded
[1:38:17] prophet said your thoughts ring louder
[1:38:19] in heaven
[1:38:23] i have much to be forgiven of
[1:38:26] maybe we should just all stand to our
[1:38:28] feet
[1:38:35] maybe we ought to just start right there
[1:38:40] where this woman was washing jesus feet
[1:38:43] with her tears
[1:38:46] i say lord forgive me
[1:38:49] i plead the blood of jesus christ that
[1:38:51] was shed at calvary
[1:38:54] i realized lord i'm guilty i'm guilty
[1:38:58] as charged i was born and sin shaped in
[1:39:00] iniquity
[1:39:01] i come into the world speaking lies and
[1:39:03] i still ain't got a handle on my life
[1:39:05] lord i need your blood
[1:39:07] i plead the blood of jesus christ that
[1:39:09] you forgive me lord
[1:39:15] oh he says it's the guarantee that
[1:39:17] everything that was ever held against
[1:39:19] you
[1:39:20] you thoroughly repented hallelujah and
[1:39:23] the property is boughten and you hold
[1:39:26] the abstract for the assurance
[1:39:28] let somebody try to put you off the land
[1:39:30] say he belongs in
[1:39:32] and you with the abstract in your hand
[1:39:36] let them try to do it there ain't a law
[1:39:38] on the land that can do it because you
[1:39:39] hold the abstract
[1:39:41] and there's no devil no church or any
[1:39:44] theology
[1:39:46] that can overstep the boundaries of
[1:39:48] god's proof and abstract
[1:39:50] that the baptism of the holy ghost has
[1:39:52] recognized
[1:39:53] us in jesus christ
[1:39:57] we're just as sure to raise as he raised
[1:40:00] because potentially we have already
[1:40:02] raised in him amen
[1:40:04] the old things what does it do to our
[1:40:06] mortal bodies it turns our opinions
[1:40:09] changes our notions it sets our
[1:40:12] affections on things above
[1:40:14] the smoking the drinking the gambling
[1:40:16] and the things you used to do is dead
[1:40:18] it's beneath you you are quickened
[1:40:22] and this quickening power brings your
[1:40:25] body
[1:40:26] into a raptured condition
[1:40:29] already because you were seed
[1:40:35] the reason you can be quickened
[1:40:40] that's why your redeemable church
[1:40:44] that's what the prophet said non-seed is
[1:40:46] not redeemable
[1:40:48] he's redeeming you back
[1:40:52] to where there never was no sin he's
[1:40:55] redeeming you back
[1:40:57] to eternity what was the threefold
[1:41:00] mystery purpose of god
[1:41:04] to express himself in jesus christ the
[1:41:06] kinsmen redeemer
[1:41:08] second to have preeminence in his bride
[1:41:11] and third
[1:41:12] where are we going we're going back
[1:41:16] to eden what a plan of redemption amen
[1:41:20] the clearing of the deed i say we ought
