[19:19] for some reading I certainly want to
[19:21] welcome everyone in the house of God you
[19:22] may turn around and welcome someone this
[19:24] morning amen
[19:32] okay
[19:36] God bless you and have your seeds
[19:48] good morning
[19:50] we're going to read Psalm 47 this
[19:53] morning
[19:54] and uh
[19:56] you know just a little thought from the
[19:58] song
[19:59] you know this is a Psalm of Praise
[20:01] there's a lot of wonderful statements
[20:03] that are made in here and
[20:05] we could probably camp out on any one of
[20:07] them but
[20:08] you know there was a particular
[20:09] statement that kind of caught my
[20:11] attention this week as I was reading it
[20:12] and that's in verse 7.
[20:15] it says this it says for God is the king
[20:18] of all the Earth
[20:21] sing ye praises
[20:23] with understanding
[20:26] not just sing praises
[20:29] but sing praises with understanding
[20:33] see these are two very different things
[20:37] you know David said in Psalm 22 3 he
[20:40] said but Thou Art holy
[20:42] o thou that inhabit us the Praises of
[20:44] Israel
[20:46] he inhabits
[20:48] dwells in
[20:50] the Praises of his people
[20:52] but you know not all praise is something
[20:55] he can inhabit
[20:58] this doesn't necessarily refer to a
[21:02] church or a worship service
[21:06] praise without understanding
[21:09] is honestly just noise
[21:14] you know just because
[21:16] a group of people Gather in a worship
[21:19] service or a church service and
[21:22] offer up praise and worship to the Lord
[21:25] it doesn't necessarily mean that he is
[21:27] there
[21:31] you know we know the scripture in
[21:32] Matthew 18 20 very well Jesus said it he
[21:35] said for where two or three are gathered
[21:37] together in my name
[21:39] there I am in the midst of them
[21:42] and we believe that
[21:44] but that doesn't necessarily give us
[21:47] license to assume
[21:51] that scripture
[21:53] is being fulfilled
[21:55] simply because two or three of us decide
[21:58] to get together and have church
[22:02] the key to the scripture is that phrase
[22:06] in my name
[22:09] he chooses where he puts his name
[22:14] he chooses where he dwells
[22:18] not us
[22:21] you know in order for us to fulfill that
[22:23] scripture
[22:26] we need to have an understanding
[22:30] he was teaching his chosen people about
[22:33] this when he was teaching them how to
[22:34] Worship in Deuteronomy 12 he said this
[22:38] then there shall be a place
[22:41] where the Lord your God shall choose
[22:44] to cause his name to dwell there
[22:48] shall ye bring all that I command you
[22:51] your burnt offerings and your sacrifices
[22:54] your tithes and the heave offering of
[22:57] your hand
[22:58] and all your choice vows which he vow
[23:01] unto the Lord
[23:03] a little later on in the chapter take
[23:04] heed to thyself
[23:06] that thou offer not thy burn offerings
[23:09] in every place that thou seeest
[23:12] you know and you see that was a constant
[23:14] struggle of the children of Israel
[23:16] throughout their history
[23:18] was rather than worshiping in the place
[23:21] that God choose chose
[23:24] in the place where he put his name in
[23:25] the manner that he had instructed
[23:28] they wanted to worship the way they
[23:30] wanted
[23:31] they set up little worship
[23:34] centers the way that they wanted where
[23:37] they wanted to worship and praise how
[23:39] they wanted to worship
[23:41] high places the scripture refers to them
[23:43] as
[23:45] verse 14 of Deuteronomy 12 but in the
[23:48] place which the Lord shall choose in one
[23:50] of thy tribes there Thou shalt offer thy
[23:53] burnt offerings and there Thou shalt do
[23:56] all that I command thee
[23:59] you see we don't decide
[24:02] where his name is
[24:04] and we don't decide
[24:07] where he dwells
[24:09] you know his Dwelling Place
[24:12] his name
[24:13] are reflections of him
[24:17] it's important that we have an
[24:19] understanding of where he dwells
[24:22] where he places his name
[24:26] prays with understanding
[24:30] you know Paul deals with this quite a
[24:32] bit in First Corinthians 14.
[24:35] when he's dealing with that Church's
[24:37] fixation on spiritual gifts
[24:39] I suppose like
[24:41] many of the churches of today
[24:44] the Corinthian Believers had started to
[24:46] get
[24:47] carried away with gifts and
[24:50] the moving of the spirit
[24:53] and Paul needed to adjust their course a
[24:55] little bit
[24:57] bring them back into balance according
[24:59] to the word and you can read the chapter
[25:01] for yourself
[25:03] but you know he refers several times to
[25:06] when the spirit moves among the
[25:09] Believers
[25:10] and there's a result of that
[25:13] that others should be edified
[25:17] you know the purpose of these gifts
[25:21] he says several times
[25:23] is that others might receive the benefit
[25:25] from that gift
[25:28] otherwise it's just noise
[25:32] Paul describes it as speaking to the air
[25:36] there's a purpose
[25:39] something that he once made known
[25:44] in the ministering of that gift or that
[25:46] work
[25:48] he sums it up in verse 15 which I
[25:50] thought
[25:51] lined up with us very well he says this
[25:54] what is it then
[25:56] I will pray with the spirit
[25:58] and I will pray with the understanding
[26:01] also
[26:03] I will sing in the spirit and I will
[26:06] sing with understanding also
[26:10] just because there are gifts
[26:12] doesn't mean he's being made known
[26:16] it's just chaos if he's not being made
[26:18] known
[26:21] just because there's praise and worship
[26:24] doesn't necessarily mean that he's made
[26:27] known
[26:28] if he and his works and his attributes
[26:32] aren't being reflected
[26:34] in that praise
[26:36] you know when Moses and Joshua were on
[26:39] Mount Sinai remember and the Lord was
[26:41] giving them the word
[26:43] there came a sound it was praise and
[26:45] worship
[26:46] the child the chosen people God's people
[26:49] giving praise and worship
[26:52] but the sound that came from that was
[26:54] the sound that sounded like battle
[26:56] it didn't sound like something that
[26:58] reflected him
[27:02] right it wasn't something that he
[27:03] inhabited
[27:04] or that identified him in fact he wanted
[27:07] to destroy them
[27:09] as a result of that praise if it had not
[27:11] been for the intercession of Moses
[27:15] see it didn't reflect or match the
[27:19] experience that they had with him and it
[27:21] didn't reflect his identity and his
[27:24] works
[27:26] you know Psalm 47 is a Psalm of praise
[27:30] but as we read it
[27:32] notice that he the Lord is being made
[27:36] known in the praise
[27:39] there are attributes and works of God
[27:43] that are being known in that praise that
[27:46] cause others to know more of him
[27:52] you know real praise reflects who he is
[27:57] to you
[27:58] to me
[27:59] the experience that we've personally had
[28:02] with him
[28:05] you know it's not just
[28:08] my response to a song leader
[28:11] or to a volume
[28:13] or to an atmosphere
[28:15] but it's me declaring the work he did
[28:17] for me
[28:20] it's not what I heard of or I've been
[28:23] taught or
[28:26] they said
[28:28] but it's what he did for me
[28:30] what I heard from him the work he did
[28:33] for me
[28:35] he's being made known in the praise
[28:39] you know when you give someone
[28:40] recognition or praise at work or at
[28:43] school
[28:44] or in the family
[28:46] you don't just randomly say
[28:49] you know Dylan's awesome
[28:51] he's awesome
[28:53] he's great
[28:55] after a while people are going to walk
[28:56] around and go
[28:58] why
[29:00] why is he awesome why is he great
[29:04] give me a what what made you start doing
[29:07] this
[29:10] you see you need to have an answer for
[29:13] why
[29:15] you say that why Dylan is awesome to you
[29:19] it's no different
[29:22] when you are praising the Lord
[29:25] you need to be able to speak to what
[29:28] he's done for you
[29:32] because there's an identity of him
[29:34] that's been known in his work in your
[29:36] life by your praise
[29:39] Psalm 9 11 says sing praises to the Lord
[29:42] which dwelleth in Zion declare among the
[29:46] people his doings
[29:50] get specific
[29:53] what have you seen him do
[29:56] what have you heard from him
[30:02] that characteristic of him that he made
[30:04] known to you is your opportunity to
[30:07] declare that attribute of him that
[30:09] others may know him
[30:11] praise with understanding
[30:15] praise isn't for us
[30:19] it's not about how we feel
[30:22] or feeling good
[30:25] it's not about the atmosphere we like
[30:29] what excites us
[30:31] it's not about entertainment or
[30:33] production
[30:36] it's not about us worshiping the way we
[30:38] want
[30:39] or how we prefer
[30:42] there's a purpose it's about making him
[30:45] known
[30:46] there's a declaration to be made
[30:50] it's us declaring
[30:54] that he's been to my door
[30:58] it's me identifying him that he passed
[31:01] by my way
[31:04] that I heard from him
[31:07] our praise is a people declaring his
[31:10] presence and his work and his identity
[31:13] let's go ahead and stand this morning
[31:16] you know as we read Psalm 47
[31:19] this is from the for the sons of Korah
[31:22] this is a redeemed people
[31:25] notice in verse 1 it says the voice that
[31:27] comes forth from them is a voice of
[31:29] Triumph
[31:30] see they've been through a battle
[31:32] and they're now speaking about the
[31:34] experience they had and they're
[31:36] declaring the attributes of the Lord
[31:40] you know so whether it's in a church
[31:41] service
[31:43] whether it's and the job or in the
[31:45] school classroom that we're at
[31:49] he inhabits the praise of his people
[31:50] when we make him known
[31:55] singing praises with understanding May
[31:57] our Praises wherever we are
[32:00] make him known so That Others May
[32:03] recognize him
[32:06] let's just read Psalm 47 this morning
[32:09] starting in verse 1. oh clap your hands
[32:13] all ye people shout unto God with the
[32:16] voice of Triumph for the Lord most high
[32:18] is terrible he is a great king over all
[32:21] the Earth he shall subdue the people
[32:23] under us and the Nations under our feet
[32:25] he shall choose our inheritance for us

[1:10:01] he got in to heaven and and they asked
[1:10:05] him if you ever lied he said he thought
[1:10:07] about everything and they realized you
[1:10:10] couldn't get him from that have you ever
[1:10:12] done anything wrong and he examined his
[1:10:16] life and realized not everything was
[1:10:18] just perfect but he said when uh
[1:10:20] judgment was about to be pronounced they
[1:10:22] heard a voice say that because they
[1:10:24] stood for me I'll stand for him
[1:10:26] amen that's what we count on that he
[1:10:29] will come on our hour of need whatever

[1:15:27] just gonna we're just going to take a
[1:15:30] quick moment to uh
[1:15:35] read a
[1:15:37] portion of the scripture this morning
[1:15:41] but I I wanted to
[1:15:44] to do it in a way that
[1:15:48] that the prophet of God reads it for us
[1:15:52] so what we're going to do is we're just
[1:15:55] going to remain standing and they'll
[1:15:57] start playing we're going to play about
[1:15:58] five minutes of a message delay the
[1:16:01] foundation for where we'd like to travel
[1:16:04] in the word of God this morning and so
[1:16:08] the prophet of God will pray and and
[1:16:13] and then we'll sit down
[1:16:15] after the reading of the scripture so
[1:16:18] Brothers if you could go ahead this
[1:16:20] morning and uh
[1:16:22] we'll we'll start right here this
[1:16:25] morning thank you
[1:16:32] now
[1:16:34] I usually have the people to stand when
[1:16:36] we read the word but tonight I'll try to
[1:16:38] Omit that because it's so so hard for
[1:16:41] you to stand
[1:16:43] but just before we
[1:16:45] read the word let's just bow our heads
[1:16:48] for a few moments as we speak to the
[1:16:50] author of the word as we've been kind of
[1:16:53] adjusting with each other and kind of
[1:16:56] letting down
[1:16:57] are as we call it letting down our hair
[1:17:01] so let's get on the sacred side now in
[1:17:04] the sincerity and
[1:17:06] turn our hearts towards heaven as we
[1:17:08] open the word now any man that's able to
[1:17:10] move his hands can open the Bible but
[1:17:12] there's no one really can open the
[1:17:14] understanding but the great holy spirit
[1:17:16] so let us speak to him
[1:17:19] our heavenly father we are
[1:17:21] certainly a lady tonight to be assembled
[1:17:24] here with this group of people
[1:17:27] this side of Eternity
[1:17:29] and to have this fine fellowship and as
[1:17:31] we sit around these tables tonight
[1:17:34] looking across at each other and
[1:17:36] business colleagues and and Christians
[1:17:40] we are aware that
[1:17:42] there's coming another time that we'll
[1:17:45] meet
[1:17:46] we trust that we'll all be there
[1:17:48] everybody present that great wedding
[1:17:51] supper in the air
[1:17:53] when the king will come out wipe all
[1:17:55] tears from our eyes and say is well done
[1:17:58] my good and Faithful Servants enter into
[1:18:00] the joys of the Lord that's been
[1:18:02] prepared for you since the foundation of
[1:18:04] the world
[1:18:05] there should be some Lord it doesn't
[1:18:07] know you
[1:18:09] and that way and I pray tonight that
[1:18:12] something will be done or said that will
[1:18:14] cause them to change their way of
[1:18:16] thinking turn to thee whether it's your
[1:18:19] present or by the the medium of
[1:18:23] television
[1:18:25] or by the tapes that will be going out
[1:18:27] from this
[1:18:28] bless us together now and bless the
[1:18:30] reading of Thy Word
[1:18:32] turn our hearts and thoughts towards
[1:18:35] the ending of this life and what will be
[1:18:37] our state at that time
[1:18:39] or we are sure father that all of us
[1:18:43] have to leave this world we're Immortals
[1:18:45] and let us look to the Eternal one the
[1:18:48] only one that can give us life beyond
[1:18:50] this
[1:18:51] through the name of his son Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] we ask that amen
[1:18:57] I would like to call your attention for
[1:18:59] a few moments now to the reading of
[1:19:02] God's word
[1:19:05] I'd like to begin reading
[1:19:08] from Saint Mark's gospel
[1:19:11] I think the 10th chapter
[1:19:14] and begin with the 17th verse
[1:19:18] and when he was gone forth into the way
[1:19:20] there came unto him one running and
[1:19:23] kneeling down and asking him
[1:19:27] saying good Master what shall I do that
[1:19:30] I may inherit eternal life
[1:19:32] Jesus said unto him walk call us thou me
[1:19:35] good
[1:19:36] there is none good but one and that is
[1:19:39] God
[1:19:40] knows the Commandments
[1:19:42] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[1:19:45] not steal do not bear false witness the
[1:19:47] fraud not honor thy father and mother
[1:19:51] and he answered and said unto him master
[1:19:54] all these things I have observed since
[1:19:57] my youth
[1:19:58] then Jesus beholding him loved him
[1:20:02] and said unto him one thing thou like us
[1:20:06] go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and
[1:20:09] give to the poor Thou shalt have
[1:20:11] Treasures in Heaven
[1:20:13] and come and take up thy cross and
[1:20:16] follow me
[1:20:19] and he was sad at that saying and one
[1:20:21] away grief for he had great possessions
[1:20:26] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[1:20:28] word as we Endeavor to pull from this a
[1:20:33] text in context now you may be seated
[1:20:36] yet
[1:20:45] it's the investment
[1:20:50] being with business people
[1:20:55] and always I think that business people
[1:20:58] is always interested in in good
[1:21:01] Investments
[1:21:03] so that I call a text now for the next
[1:21:05] few moments the Investments
[1:21:09] a good businessman is always looking for
[1:21:12] a good Sound Investment
[1:21:16] if he isn't then he isn't a good
[1:21:18] businessman
[1:21:19] he must look for something that's real
[1:21:23] and I'd like to talk to you
[1:21:26] on the invitation that I give to you a
[1:21:30] few moments ago on this eternal life
[1:21:32] policy
[1:21:34] as I introduce myself as a a businessman
[1:21:38] and I have a business and I'd like to
[1:21:42] talk to you a few moments about it in a
[1:21:44] few scriptures I have written down here
[1:21:46] in text I'd like to use these for a few
[1:21:48] moments these notes
[1:21:51] it's not a a good business to gamble any
[1:21:55] man knows that that gambling is not a
[1:21:58] good business because it's taken a
[1:22:00] chance
[1:22:02] you never or sell them see a gambler one
[1:22:06] day he's a rich man the next day he's
[1:22:08] begging
[1:22:09] so you take too much of a chance to to
[1:22:13] gamble
[1:22:14] I think a a gambler is
[1:22:17] just simply living on the spare of the
[1:22:20] moment and not looking forward to the
[1:22:22] future
[1:22:23] or you wouldn't be gambling
[1:22:26] I do not believe in some of these get
[1:22:30] rich overnight
[1:22:31] Investments either by some unidentified
[1:22:35] business
[1:22:37] any good businessman wouldn't take a
[1:22:39] chance like that maybe on your your
[1:22:41] life's savings your earnings
[1:22:44] and you would uh invested in some uh
[1:22:47] getting I get rich right quick it's
[1:22:51] unidentified someone running with some
[1:22:53] kind of an idea here we uh we got a
[1:22:55] certain firm here there's no background
[1:22:58] to it I think a good sound thinking man
[1:23:01] would be foolish to try to make an
[1:23:03] investment in such a a company as that
[1:23:07] because I had a friend one time that
[1:23:10] that tried such a thing and when he did
[1:23:12] he lost everything he had
[1:23:14] and he lost all of his life's earnings
[1:23:17] about ready to retire and he thought
[1:23:18] well I'll I'll take this chance because
[1:23:20] the man seemed to be knew what he was
[1:23:24] talking about but come to find out the
[1:23:26] the company was just a make-belief
[1:23:29] company and no stocks or nothing so the
[1:23:31] poor fella lost everything he had so I
[1:23:34] think if a man wants to make a good
[1:23:37] investment he should first check his
[1:23:40] company or whatever he's making an
[1:23:41] investment in
[1:23:43] to find out what he's going to do I
[1:23:46] think any sensible thinking person would
[1:23:49] do that and then again before go on I
[1:23:53] like to say it's not a good idea to keep
[1:23:55] your money in your pocket
[1:23:57] many people say I'll just put it in my
[1:23:59] pocket and I I got it but you know
[1:24:02] you're a businessman and women you don't
[1:24:04] think in those terms and it's not a good
[1:24:07] thing because it can be stolen it's best
[1:24:10] to have it in circulation like the Lord
[1:24:12] said one time he gives so many talents
[1:24:15] to so many and such and then they made
[1:24:17] an investment with it and those who made
[1:24:20] a good Sound Investment he uh give them
[1:24:23] the dividends but when one man said I
[1:24:26] just kept it I I didn't want to take any
[1:24:29] chances on it I I put it in my pocket or
[1:24:32] I buried it somewhere
[1:24:34] Danny taking that what he had gave to
[1:24:36] him and give it to the one that had
[1:24:38] drawn more dividends and put it to a
[1:24:41] good investment and that's our large way
[1:24:44] of doing things now
[1:24:48] but uh if you were going to invest in
[1:24:51] something that you wanted to be sure in
[1:24:52] you'd find some good reliable firm that
[1:24:56] has been proven that it'll pay off right
[1:25:00] now that's a good sound in investment if
[1:25:04] you've tested the firm you know it's
[1:25:07] backgrounds talk with somebody who's
[1:25:09] done business with this firm
[1:25:11] hear the testimony of everyone it's a
[1:25:14] hundred percent they're always right on
[1:25:17] the dot with their dividends and there's
[1:25:19] a great uh resource Capital behind it
[1:25:22] the company's not going broke and that's
[1:25:25] a good Sound Investment
[1:25:28] and now all through life people's been
[1:25:31] uh taught them
[1:25:34] now we're speaking tonight on the
[1:25:36] scripture
[1:25:38] of a young Hebrew boy that was a wealthy
[1:25:43] type of a land he might have come from a
[1:25:45] real good home no doubt his testimony
[1:25:47] showed that he come from a good home
[1:25:51] he was called in the Bible the Rich
[1:25:54] Young Ruler I'm going to change it
[1:25:57] tonight just a little bit say a rich
[1:25:59] young businessman
[1:26:01] because he had a business and he was
[1:26:05] interested in in business
[1:26:07] no doubt his father had been a great
[1:26:10] successful businessman or he probably
[1:26:12] wouldn't have had what he had
[1:26:14] but he was uh brought up to to be a
[1:26:19] businessman
[1:26:20] and he seen something in this young
[1:26:23] fella of Galilee this young Prophet by
[1:26:27] the name of Jesus of Nazareth
[1:26:30] no doubt he'd heard his priests speak
[1:26:31] about him and maybe against him
[1:26:34] but when he got his first glimpse
[1:26:38] at the Lord Jesus there was something
[1:26:40] about him that was different from any
[1:26:42] other man
[1:26:45] and I say this as a Christian
[1:26:48] it is truly hasn't changed
[1:26:52] we have great theologians in the land
[1:26:56] throughout the world we've had them for
[1:26:59] thousands of years
[1:27:01] that can introduce to us a Creed and
[1:27:06] they're schooled in those creeds and a
[1:27:09] church that's that's a well-established
[1:27:11] Church
[1:27:12] but uh that still isn't my my
[1:27:17] policy tonight I'm speaking of I'm
[1:27:19] talking about
[1:27:21] eternal life
[1:27:25] now certainly I'm not worthy to take
[1:27:28] over where brother Branham left off in
[1:27:31] any way but
[1:27:34] um just what's on my heart this morning
[1:27:36] to to share with you is
[1:27:40] um
[1:27:41] that the prophet of God used kind of the
[1:27:44] background if I could say that as of
[1:27:49] of investing
[1:27:52] and uh we've been talking about faith
[1:27:56] because our whole heart's desire as a
[1:28:01] body of Believers is not to have a faith
[1:28:05] but to possess faith and we we're not
[1:28:09] calling it a faith as uh what we believe
[1:28:13] a a doctrinal faith or we believe this
[1:28:16] we believe that or leave we believe that
[1:28:19] but we're striving for every member in
[1:28:23] the body to have a working faith
[1:28:27] a faith that's capable of accomplishment
[1:28:32] and uh uh uh faith that has the ability
[1:28:37] to withstand and uh go forward and to uh
[1:28:41] if I could say it this way of faith that
[1:28:44] would change things
[1:28:46] and uh so uh we want to uh invest in uh
[1:28:53] uh something and uh and I think our
[1:28:57] Prophet laid that out
[1:29:00] a very uh clear uh he he makes this
[1:29:05] statement he said uh when the uh this
[1:29:10] Rich Young Ruler meant the Lord Jesus he
[1:29:14] saw something different about him he he
[1:29:17] knew there was something different but
[1:29:19] he knew that he possessed something
[1:29:23] to give so he that's why he asked him he
[1:29:28] said Master what must I do to inherit in
[1:29:32] eternal life
[1:29:33] and uh so when he meant this uh man that
[1:29:39] possessed something and what Jesus
[1:29:42] possessed was eternal life that's what
[1:29:45] he had that's what he had to offer you
[1:29:48] know he that was his gift to mankind I
[1:29:52] am the way the truth the life you know
[1:29:54] come unto me all ye there heavy laden
[1:29:57] and I'll I'll give you rest these are
[1:29:59] the kind of things that that uh this
[1:30:02] Rich Young Ruler heard and it caught his
[1:30:06] eye and it caught his attention and it
[1:30:10] it drew to him to realize that Jesus had
[1:30:15] something that he didn't have
[1:30:18] and so he was seeking it and then what
[1:30:21] he really realized that Jesus had
[1:30:24] because Jesus was talking about a
[1:30:28] kingdom another kingdom another land
[1:30:31] beyond the river uh in my father's house
[1:30:34] are many mansions I wouldn't tell you so
[1:30:37] now when we read our Bible we go through
[1:30:41] Matthew Mark Luke and John and we just
[1:30:44] see the statements once recorded
[1:30:48] but I I forgive me if this offends
[1:30:51] anybody but I just believe the prophet
[1:30:54] of God's Ministry paralleled the Lord's
[1:30:56] Ministry so much the same you read at
[1:30:59] one time in the Bible but Jesus is out
[1:31:02] preaching meeting after meeting after
[1:31:05] meeting he's making these statements
[1:31:08] hundreds of times uh the different
[1:31:10] people you know I am the way the truth
[1:31:13] the life he said that all over the
[1:31:15] country if that may be in one sermon he
[1:31:19] might have mentioned what we would call
[1:31:21] all the Beatitudes all the statements
[1:31:24] all the great things he was telling them
[1:31:26] about a kingdom he was he was telling
[1:31:30] them about a lamb beyond the river in
[1:31:32] fact Jesus was preaching on Exodus amen
[1:31:36] he was a preaching a coming out and to a
[1:31:39] going into he was bringing something
[1:31:42] that they didn't have they were buckled
[1:31:45] by the law and he was going to give of
[1:31:48] them spirit in life John truly baptized
[1:31:51] with water but I come to baptize with
[1:31:54] the spirit and so you you've got to
[1:31:57] understand he just it wasn't he went
[1:32:00] here and preached this one time he
[1:32:02] preached it over and over and over again
[1:32:05] everywhere that he went everywhere then
[1:32:07] he went he was telling the pair of same
[1:32:09] Parables he told them all over the
[1:32:12] country he he pointed to the truth of it
[1:32:14] I haven't come to destroy the law I've
[1:32:17] come to fulfill it he may have started
[1:32:20] every sermon that way
[1:32:23] so you you've got to you've got to get
[1:32:26] our minds
[1:32:28] you understand understanding that this
[1:32:32] is a living life it's a faith
[1:32:37] and and it's it's not a
[1:32:41] uh just the way that we think in a
[1:32:45] straight line
[1:32:48] Jesus is preaching out what he was
[1:32:51] preaching just like our messenger he
[1:32:54] would go place after Place telling the
[1:32:56] same things bringing the same thing what
[1:32:59] was he telling me he says what what's
[1:33:01] what you're seeing in front of you
[1:33:04] this man standing here with this
[1:33:07] prophetic gift the ability to discern
[1:33:11] the thoughts and intents of a heart this
[1:33:14] is what was promised in the scriptures
[1:33:18] you are seeing the scriptures fulfilled
[1:33:22] this is what he said this is he that
[1:33:26] come to to uh free the Brokenhearted to
[1:33:30] lose to bring judgment you know this is
[1:33:33] the one that's come to open the seals
[1:33:35] and and to give us the truth of the life
[1:33:39] what you're looking at is the word of
[1:33:42] God manifested in flesh it's God veiled
[1:33:45] in flesh the unveiling of God this is
[1:33:48] the voice that must have exposed the Son
[1:33:51] of Perdition and to expose to you
[1:33:56] the Trap of the enemy and expose the
[1:33:59] wicked one this is the one that was to
[1:34:01] call you out of the bondage of the
[1:34:05] church world and come unto life more and
[1:34:08] abundantly this was the one that you see
[1:34:11] here that's Discerning the thoughts of
[1:34:14] intents of the heart this is the one
[1:34:15] that was promised to come back to
[1:34:18] restore your faith
[1:34:20] yeah
[1:34:22] that's right
[1:34:24] so they were seeing
[1:34:28] this Young Rich ruler was seeing with
[1:34:31] his eyes the scriptures being fulfilled
[1:34:36] he was watching it unfold and he was
[1:34:39] astute enough to to comprehend it
[1:34:44] and deceit that there was a message that
[1:34:48] he was saying something how many of us
[1:34:51] this morning understand the prophet of
[1:34:53] God is saying something
[1:35:00] and it changed his attitude
[1:35:04] do you understand this young man ritual
[1:35:06] when he saw in Jesus he had an attitude
[1:35:09] change prophet of God says alike I think
[1:35:12] today this is a paragraph 38 I think
[1:35:15] today it hasn't changed too much
[1:35:18] Bible readers and Bible lovers when we
[1:35:22] really get a glimpse
[1:35:24] in our intellects intellects
[1:35:27] of what Jesus was and what he is it
[1:35:31] changes our entire attitude
[1:35:37] so that's what the preaching of the word
[1:35:41] of God's for
[1:35:43] is to change your attitude
[1:35:45] your attitudes the way you feel to
[1:35:48] things the way you respond to things the
[1:35:51] atmosphere that that you create around
[1:35:54] you and if I could say this the gospel
[1:35:59] is really trying hard to take us out of
[1:36:02] the negative attitude into a positive
[1:36:05] attitude
[1:36:08] your well-being
[1:36:11] is the purpose of the Gospel
[1:36:15] it isn't to judge you it isn't to
[1:36:18] condemn you he could do that with just
[1:36:21] the move of his little finger he's not
[1:36:23] interested in that he's interested in
[1:36:26] fellowshipping with you restoring you
[1:36:28] back to where you come from letting you
[1:36:31] know who you are
[1:36:34] he's got such a a positive
[1:36:38] uh
[1:36:39] desire and love in his heart for you in
[1:36:43] fact he so loved you he sacrifices only
[1:36:46] begotten son for you it must you know it
[1:36:51] must have killed him
[1:36:53] to see his son nailed to the cross
[1:36:57] looked at one of your children
[1:37:01] how would you like to stand by and and
[1:37:06] I couldn't do it
[1:37:10] if you try to take one of my boys and it
[1:37:14] could now I I would I I would do
[1:37:17] everything I could
[1:37:21] but yet he stood back
[1:37:24] you know why because he knew the results
[1:37:26] of that cross would be you with him back
[1:37:31] eternally
[1:37:36] oh
[1:37:38] that's the first thing that that this
[1:37:41] business that Jesus did it exchanged
[1:37:45] this man's attitude and and that's what
[1:37:50] I'm wanting to base this on this morning
[1:37:55] and
[1:37:56] to uh
[1:37:59] make mention of that to you this morning
[1:38:03] that maybe our attitudes would we would
[1:38:07] take into consideration as our Prophet
[1:38:10] mentioned and that this morning are
[1:38:13] thinking
[1:38:14] might change
[1:38:16] are thinking about what we're investing
[1:38:19] in
[1:38:20] the investment and this is what struck
[1:38:24] me that brought me to the importance of
[1:38:27] this he said this you don't need to show
[1:38:30] this but he says this he says our Bible
[1:38:32] tells us in Revelations the third
[1:38:34] chapter
[1:38:35] that the church in this age is going to
[1:38:39] be identified just like this Rich Young
[1:38:43] Hebrew boy
[1:38:45] Rich have need of nothing this lady
[1:38:48] you'll see a age if there happens to be
[1:38:51] a minister here or a Bible reader this
[1:38:54] is this is the need nothing no it's not
[1:39:00] thou because without our wretched blind
[1:39:02] poor naked and don't know it it's a sad
[1:39:05] thing of this scriptural quotation is
[1:39:10] so the reason that
[1:39:14] he brings this to us he says look at
[1:39:17] this rich
[1:39:20] Young Ruler
[1:39:22] and what what his thought process is
[1:39:25] what he's going through and if you do
[1:39:29] that
[1:39:31] you will get a real picture of the age
[1:39:34] that we live in the attitudes that we're
[1:39:39] in
[1:39:42] because correction
[1:39:46] is only correction when it exposes the
[1:39:51] air
[1:39:52] and gives to you the solution
[1:39:58] otherwise it's pure criticism
[1:40:05] you know if somebody came up to me says
[1:40:07] Ah that's terrible well I'd want an old
[1:40:10] cake what can I do about it what do I
[1:40:12] have to do to make it right well if
[1:40:15] someone would come up and say you know
[1:40:16] brother McGarry you're doing it all
[1:40:18] wrong if you would do it this way you
[1:40:21] would have better results
[1:40:25] you see the then that that's that's not
[1:40:29] criticism
[1:40:31] right so that could that's the the
[1:40:33] beauty of it see and so he he it's it's
[1:40:37] something that's for our well-being and
[1:40:41] so it gets to to make us more aware so
[1:40:45] you you've got to uh we've got to
[1:40:47] understand that it's our our uh he's
[1:40:52] trying to get to our attitude now he
[1:40:54] told us he said nobody just sits around
[1:40:57] and doesn't invest
[1:41:01] so what what does investment mean and
[1:41:05] that's what it means that you put
[1:41:07] something into it
[1:41:11] you you understand you
[1:41:15] put something in into something
[1:41:19] you're going to give it some investment
[1:41:21] you know we you we might say that study
[1:41:25] you that study sit down and study you're
[1:41:28] investing in your uh your whatever it is
[1:41:32] that you're seeking after maybe to be a
[1:41:35] nurse and you you want to invest in
[1:41:38] being a nurse well you just don't show
[1:41:40] up at the hospital and say I'm a nurse
[1:41:43] that's a get quick Rich Game
[1:41:46] you know or I did some online training
[1:41:51] you know you might put the bed Pine on
[1:41:53] somebody's head as a hat
[1:41:55] you don't know
[1:41:57] you get it all messed up
[1:42:00] there's you've got to invest
[1:42:03] you've got to invest in it because
[1:42:05] people that have set these uh
[1:42:08] certifications you invested to get that
[1:42:11] certification so to invest something
[1:42:14] means that that uh you've got to uh uh
[1:42:19] uh put something into it
[1:42:24] you know you you can't sit there and
[1:42:27] wish
[1:42:30] you got to do the work
[1:42:33] you got to do the work you know when you
[1:42:36] show up on your job uh
[1:42:39] you know and we got people that show up
[1:42:43] on jobs and collect money and if you
[1:42:47] show up on a job and you don't invest in
[1:42:49] that job and you don't do the work
[1:42:51] you're a thief that's right
[1:42:55] and you say well I just testify on the
[1:42:57] job you're a Biblical Thief
[1:43:04] does the Bible says there's a time and
[1:43:07] there's a season a time to work a time
[1:43:09] to talk time to sing
[1:43:12] you know we get DP that just goes oh I
[1:43:15] just what would you get anything that I
[1:43:17] know but I testify to a guy you robbed
[1:43:19] Robert
[1:43:21] you know you that guy might get to
[1:43:24] heaven but you're lost
[1:43:30] that's not kind of investment
[1:43:33] you invest in your job you invest in
[1:43:35] your work you get there you give it a
[1:43:37] hundred percent and then you receive the
[1:43:39] reward if you don't like the rewards
[1:43:42] you're receiving to your investment go
[1:43:44] to your moth
[1:43:47] say I'm working here
[1:43:49] you're not paying me enough
[1:43:56] that's not hard to do
[1:44:02] but you have to invest
[1:44:05] and there's something the prophet of
[1:44:08] God's cause this calls this message the
[1:44:11] investment
[1:44:14] so
[1:44:15] there's got to be something worth
[1:44:17] investing in
[1:44:19] yeah and I'd like you if they're read
[1:44:21] with me if you you you would that uh
[1:44:25] this paragraph
[1:44:27] 39.
[1:44:29] and the reason I take the time to read
[1:44:34] the paragraphs with you because I want
[1:44:36] you to understand that there's been a
[1:44:39] Vindicated profit sent to this day
[1:44:42] that's trying to get something across to
[1:44:45] you
[1:44:47] and if you don't listen to it and you
[1:44:50] don't invest in it and you don't
[1:44:53] understand what he's trying to say
[1:44:56] you miss it
[1:44:59] right so this guy saw it after it
[1:45:03] didn't he
[1:45:04] but then when he heard what was said
[1:45:08] that's where the problem came in
[1:45:11] so people in the map the prophet in
[1:45:13] search this in here
[1:45:16] to make it personal
[1:45:19] to each of us individually
[1:45:23] you've got to choose what you're going
[1:45:26] to put
[1:45:28] into something
[1:45:30] your every day's breath
[1:45:34] every heartbeat
[1:45:36] is put into something
[1:45:43] and I know the uh I thought this was
[1:45:46] quite a statement that when our brother
[1:45:49] was here testifying our brother Billy
[1:45:52] Paul he testified he said daddy told me
[1:45:54] if I was going to be a bum not to work
[1:45:56] one day of my life
[1:46:00] I know you're going to invest in being a
[1:46:03] bum
[1:46:04] be a bum
[1:46:08] you know what I mean don't don't worry
[1:46:10] about it be a bum
[1:46:12] what you're going to invest in
[1:46:14] be a bum he makes a statement he says
[1:46:17] now there's not a man that lives
[1:46:21] that in his right mind
[1:46:25] but what's always wondering where he
[1:46:28] come from
[1:46:30] who is he and where is he going
[1:46:40] just think of that
[1:46:44] there has been many books written
[1:46:47] philosophers has raised philosophers
[1:46:51] have raised and fell
[1:46:54] but there is only one book that'll tell
[1:46:57] you who you are
[1:47:00] where you come from and where you are
[1:47:05] going and that's the Bible
[1:47:10] it's the only book
[1:47:12] of all the fine books we have
[1:47:16] you could trash you could trash them
[1:47:20] everyone
[1:47:22] this is the truth
[1:47:25] anything contrary to this is not right
[1:47:29] Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my
[1:47:33] words shall never fail Every Man's word
[1:47:36] shall be a lie God shall be true so you
[1:47:41] know what's he saying if we would say
[1:47:43] this this morning what is your view of
[1:47:45] yourself
[1:47:48] it's what he's asking any man in his
[1:47:51] right mind
[1:47:52] wants wants to know knows this he he
[1:47:57] wonders you know where did he come from
[1:48:02] where did I come from how did I get in
[1:48:05] this condition that I'm in not where did
[1:48:08] I come from my mommy and daddy
[1:48:12] but what path
[1:48:15] brought me to my present State of Mind
[1:48:22] what path brought me to the condition
[1:48:26] I'm in
[1:48:28] the depression I'm in the the the if I
[1:48:33] could say it this the the
[1:48:34] self-worthlessness
[1:48:41] that I have
[1:48:43] the complexes that I have the fears that
[1:48:47] I have the doubts that I have what
[1:48:50] brought me to the personality that I
[1:48:53] have the way I respond to things
[1:48:57] and so if we ought to ask that question
[1:49:00] and if you're in your right mind you
[1:49:03] ought to ask that question
[1:49:05] because all of us have all kinds of Mind
[1:49:08] battles going on and we don't realize
[1:49:11] that this mind battles are affecting us
[1:49:15] and these mind battles are going to
[1:49:19] cause us to go in a certain direction in
[1:49:23] that he says wonders where he's come
[1:49:25] from who he is
[1:49:28] and where he's going
[1:49:30] so where is this present mind
[1:49:34] thought that I have
[1:49:36] who am I and where am I going
[1:49:41] now if you if you don't have any of
[1:49:44] those questions
[1:49:47] if you don't have anything I would have
[1:49:49] to say that if he said you're not in
[1:49:52] your right mind then
[1:49:55] I'll let him speak for me
[1:49:58] because he's Vindicated
[1:50:03] so we're not just talking about a story
[1:50:06] we're talking about a story
[1:50:10] that is a reflection of our condition
[1:50:17] basically saying every single one of you
[1:50:20] this morning sits in the same spot that
[1:50:24] that Rich Young Ruler sat in because he
[1:50:28] identified the condition of the age
[1:50:34] is that clear
[1:50:38] so we we have it set right before us so
[1:50:41] we can look at ourselves right now this
[1:50:44] morning
[1:50:47] and say where did I come from what got
[1:50:50] me here
[1:50:53] you might be sitting in class because
[1:50:55] you might say how would I get into this
[1:50:57] class why am I here taking this class is
[1:50:59] this who really am I do I really want to
[1:51:02] be a nurse do I really want to do this
[1:51:04] do I really want to do that
[1:51:09] I'll let brother Adrian's testimony
[1:51:12] could be a vindication
[1:51:15] of what's being said this morning
[1:51:21] if you're in your right mind you're
[1:51:23] asking yourselves these questions
[1:51:27] yeah
[1:51:28] they might give a my own personal
[1:51:30] testimony my brother Dennis went
[1:51:32] overseas so he had a painting truck and
[1:51:36] ladders and everything so I thought you
[1:51:39] know what I'll do I'll just buy all that
[1:51:41] from them he can use the money to go on
[1:51:44] the mission field and I'll keep his
[1:51:47] business alive
[1:51:49] and when he gets back in six months
[1:51:51] because he's bound to be a failure
[1:51:53] I'll give it all back to him
[1:51:59] well six months turned into
[1:52:02] I don't know how many years
[1:52:04] so I had all this stuff and I could
[1:52:08] never do nothing halfway so all of a
[1:52:10] sudden I had 22 painters working for me
[1:52:13] I have five or six Vans I I put a you
[1:52:18] know I put a hundred and some miles on a
[1:52:21] pickup truck in one year one day I
[1:52:24] walked into a a house that I was
[1:52:26] painting and I thought
[1:52:28] I don't want to do this
[1:52:33] what got me here
[1:52:35] where is this taking me
[1:52:40] I mean it was just like
[1:52:43] what am I investing in
[1:52:45] what am I putting all my effort in
[1:52:48] where is it going what what's the
[1:52:51] outcome of it it can't and I began to
[1:52:55] view myself
[1:53:00] this isn't who I am
[1:53:04] I had to go back
[1:53:06] and and look at my attitude I had to go
[1:53:11] back and deeply consider
[1:53:14] go what was what was I putting into it
[1:53:20] and what the return was going to be
[1:53:26] and I don't know uh
[1:53:29] it wasn't my calling
[1:53:33] but I had to examine
[1:53:36] what it is that I'm investing in
[1:53:41] now we're not we're not talking about
[1:53:43] carnal but we're going to use the carnal
[1:53:46] or the natural to type the spiritual
[1:53:51] and because he said it's not good
[1:53:55] to leave something in your pocket
[1:53:59] but to put it into circulation
[1:54:03] could I say this stuff this morning it's
[1:54:06] not good to keep your faith in your
[1:54:09] pocket your faith needs to be in
[1:54:11] circulation
[1:54:17] we look at this break
[1:54:20] a thing that was here so this man came
[1:54:24] up and his attitude has changed
[1:54:29] he runs up and the only thing that the
[1:54:32] Lord Jesus can do is provide to him the
[1:54:37] opportunity
[1:54:42] the opportunity to put
[1:54:47] himself
[1:54:51] and answer the questions who am I where
[1:54:54] am I going
[1:54:56] uh uh what's the outcome of this how did
[1:55:00] I get here so he got there he realized
[1:55:03] he didn't possess eternal life
[1:55:07] maybe you've sat for church for years
[1:55:09] and you realize you don't you haven't
[1:55:11] really received the baptism of the Holy
[1:55:14] Spirit you believe with all your heart
[1:55:17] and that's good that's all you can do
[1:55:20] live it with everything you've got but
[1:55:22] if you're lacking something you ask him
[1:55:25] for it
[1:55:28] Lord give it to me
[1:55:31] knock
[1:55:33] and it shall be open seek and you shall
[1:55:37] find all that the father has given me I
[1:55:40] give to you take those promises and
[1:55:44] believe them and expect them to happen
[1:55:49] so
[1:55:50] he was given the opportunity
[1:55:55] so the opportunity to invest
[1:56:00] was given him
[1:56:01] you want eternal life
[1:56:04] do this
[1:56:06] he said I've done all those things
[1:56:09] and I still don't feel I have it
[1:56:18] and that's what happened it'll happen to
[1:56:20] you you come to the best church and
[1:56:23] you've got the best fellowship and the
[1:56:25] best preachers the best word in
[1:56:27] everything but there's something that's
[1:56:29] not satisfied
[1:56:31] on the inside
[1:56:33] that's what's lacking is the Deep
[1:56:37] that calls
[1:56:42] you understand that the boy lacked what
[1:56:45] sulfur
[1:56:47] the sulfur the need the lacking of
[1:56:50] sulfur was what was calling
[1:56:53] it was the deep that caused to the Deep
[1:56:55] if there's a dissatisfaction in your
[1:56:58] mind a dissatisfaction with your
[1:57:01] condition a dissatisfaction with where
[1:57:03] you're going a dissatisfaction with who
[1:57:06] you are that's the Deep that's calling
[1:57:10] and then there's a deep
[1:57:12] to respond to that
[1:57:18] he'll respond to that he'll answer those
[1:57:20] questions but the opportunity is given
[1:57:23] the opportunity was given to him
[1:57:27] to invest in eternal life
[1:57:31] but
[1:57:32] what what when it came down to it
[1:57:35] can he really looked at it uh
[1:57:40] in in it was the opportunity to to
[1:57:44] receive it you know what he just didn't
[1:57:48] invest because he didn't
[1:57:51] want to do
[1:57:53] what came with it
[1:58:03] you know he
[1:58:05] I think he saw the value of it
[1:58:10] but he wasn't willing to pay the price
[1:58:14] he wasn't willing to uh
[1:58:18] to
[1:58:20] take on what went with it
[1:58:24] because so if I could say it this way he
[1:58:27] he wasn't interested in the cost of it
[1:58:33] the price that it was
[1:58:36] he didn't want to take that challenge
[1:58:40] or he didn't want to invest that much
[1:58:44] into it
[1:58:45] you know he he was willing if it was a
[1:58:48] little lower cost
[1:58:50] or a little lower price if he didn't
[1:58:53] have to give is all
[1:58:57] you know I mean then he could have he
[1:58:59] could have got by with with uh just to
[1:59:03] say okay Lord I'm willing to give an
[1:59:05] hour a week
[1:59:08] I'm not willing you know there's another
[1:59:10] good couple that was offered an
[1:59:12] opportunity to invest in the Bible you
[1:59:15] know who that was don't you it was
[1:59:16] ananias and savira amen they were given
[1:59:20] the opportunity to invest into the
[1:59:22] kingdom but they they weren't sure of it
[1:59:25] they weren't sure of the investment it
[1:59:27] wasn't a hundred percent they didn't
[1:59:29] know what the return was so they held
[1:59:32] some back just in case
[1:59:37] good morning
[1:59:39] but there's one thing that's lacking he
[1:59:41] said
[1:59:43] sell all that you have
[1:59:45] give it to the poor and come follow me
[1:59:49] oh
[1:59:50] wait a minute
[1:59:52] all of a sudden eternal life
[1:59:56] didn't have the same value
[2:00:02] and that he didn't value
[2:00:05] eternal life
[2:00:06] may I say this
[2:00:09] you want to make the rapture
[2:00:14] right
[2:00:17] well in order to make the rapture
[2:00:22] you have to invest in the rapture
[2:00:28] it isn't an investment if you don't put
[2:00:32] anything into it
[2:00:36] and you can't tag along
[2:00:41] because every credential you understand
[2:00:44] that when you come to the gates of that
[2:00:47] City that there's the spirit of God is
[2:00:50] there to examine the credentials that
[2:00:53] there's the blood is there that the
[2:00:56] spirit is there that the investment is
[2:00:59] there he's looking at you say have you
[2:01:01] invested in this Kingdom have you
[2:01:03] invested in this city of gold have you
[2:01:06] invested in this New Jerusalem I I don't
[2:01:09] see that you've got a dime on the books
[2:01:16] you haven't put nothing extra into it
[2:01:20] you get the bare minimum
[2:01:23] well the bare minimum return
[2:01:27] is you miss the rapture
[2:01:30] you come up at the Judgment seat
[2:01:34] he exposes all your life all your sins
[2:01:39] and then you still get in
[2:01:43] but you're not living in that City
[2:01:48] you won't get the full reward
[2:01:54] you invested dime you get a dime you
[2:01:58] invest a dollar you get a dollar
[2:02:03] right
[2:02:04] what you saw
[2:02:07] is what you receive
[2:02:12] you invest in the world you get world
[2:02:16] it's a law of investment
[2:02:18] Jesus said that
[2:02:20] he gave man things and what he judging
[2:02:24] by how they invested how did you invest
[2:02:27] with what God gave you told the told
[2:02:29] Parable on it but we actually sit here
[2:02:32] wrap ourselves in a religious blanket
[2:02:35] called the message thinking that because
[2:02:37] he made it we're gonna made it but you
[2:02:41] just look at his investment into this
[2:02:44] message for what he believed
[2:02:50] he lost a wife he lost a child he lost a
[2:02:53] reputation he he suffered
[2:03:00] he went out and prayed for the sick
[2:03:02] tried to win souls live on sandwiches
[2:03:04] witnessing in the face another he didn't
[2:03:07] get there
[2:03:09] without putting anything into it
[2:03:17] now you didn't have to pay the price
[2:03:20] but there's still something that you
[2:03:23] invest you invest for return
[2:03:30] we just read what he said you look for
[2:03:33] something that's got good what good
[2:03:35] dividend good return you're going to
[2:03:38] invest in it because there's a return
[2:03:40] it's not a get rich quick scheme and
[2:03:44] there's I'm only going to put a little
[2:03:46] bit in and get a ton back
[2:03:50] you know like a Ponzi
[2:03:53] and all all of these business schemes
[2:03:59] he said that's not a long-term
[2:04:02] investment a long-term investment is
[2:04:05] something that gives continually
[2:04:08] returns for a long time
[2:04:12] now there's people that that invest in
[2:04:14] what they call short-term Investments
[2:04:17] they put a lot of money in to get a
[2:04:20] quick little bit of money on that real
[2:04:23] fast and then they've got they look for
[2:04:26] another short term and another short
[2:04:29] term but they're continually investing
[2:04:31] continuing investing I like the Long
[2:04:34] Haul
[2:04:36] you know I like more at the end than
[2:04:39] lots of little bits in between
[2:04:43] now I don't want to sell all that I can
[2:04:46] have from the word of God for a little
[2:04:48] sensation or a little feeling
[2:04:52] so let's just take a look at them a mark
[2:04:54] so he wasn't interested when he found
[2:04:58] out what it cost
[2:05:02] but the investment
[2:05:04] was made very clear to him
[2:05:08] it was worth investing in he said now he
[2:05:12] said this is uh
[2:05:17] he says this kind of in paragraph 45
[2:05:20] this Hebrew lad being raised up in a
[2:05:23] home and knowed the Bible had clearly
[2:05:27] told them the Scrolls god Jehovah had
[2:05:31] said If they raise up one among you who
[2:05:35] is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord
[2:05:38] will make myself known to him in visions
[2:05:41] and in what he says comes to pass then
[2:05:45] hear that Prophet for I am with him but
[2:05:48] if it doesn't come to pass then don't
[2:05:52] hear it
[2:05:53] so he recognized that the investment was
[2:05:58] valid
[2:06:04] how many people have I seen fall from
[2:06:06] this message because they didn't think
[2:06:09] the investment was valid
[2:06:12] they didn't believe they fact they
[2:06:14] finally figured out that they could make
[2:06:17] the Rapture some other way than this
[2:06:23] oh Jesus Loves Me He died on the cross
[2:06:27] for me
[2:06:28] Jesus loved the Richmond ruler
[2:06:32] Jesus loved Judas
[2:06:37] the scripture said when he came he loved
[2:06:39] them
[2:06:43] but his love was the opportunity
[2:06:49] he still had to invest
[2:06:53] he had to put something into it
[2:06:56] and because
[2:06:58] to this man
[2:07:01] who he was
[2:07:04] where he come from
[2:07:07] and where he was going
[2:07:10] the only way for him to get eternal life
[2:07:15] and Jesus knew that by Discerning it
[2:07:19] that this man couldn't continue on the
[2:07:22] path he was going and have eternal life
[2:07:26] the only thing he had to do is cut away
[2:07:31] from the whole thing
[2:07:34] how many knows where the Bible says we
[2:07:36] find them
[2:07:42] we find them later with Lazarus at his
[2:07:44] gate
[2:07:45] and then we find them after that begging
[2:07:49] for Lazarus just to put a drop of water
[2:07:52] on his tongue because he missed the
[2:07:55] opportunity because the cost was too
[2:07:58] great
[2:08:00] but that cost was the only thing that
[2:08:04] was going to deliver him from who he was
[2:08:09] where he come from and where he was
[2:08:11] going
[2:08:14] do you hear me
[2:08:19] another he had to invest in something
[2:08:23] else
[2:08:24] and he had to invest big time
[2:08:33] because he had a big devil
[2:08:37] and Jesus knew
[2:08:39] this is the kind of investment that it's
[2:08:42] going to take
[2:08:44] you understand so here's what he
[2:08:46] determined he said in paying a language
[2:08:50] it's only sound thinking
[2:08:53] if he said it and it doesn't happen then
[2:08:57] it's a lie
[2:08:59] God did not say it but if he says it and
[2:09:04] it does happen it's truth and nothing is
[2:09:07] more more truer than truth
[2:09:10] so that was the determination
[2:09:13] that was the determination of whether it
[2:09:16] was Worthy
[2:09:18] to invest in
[2:09:21] if what he said comes to pass
[2:09:26] then you know this is worthy this is
[2:09:29] true this is worth investing in
[2:09:33] so when you sit back and you see him
[2:09:36] turn us back to the audience you see him
[2:09:39] tell what people say you saw him
[2:09:41] prophesy about the conditions of the
[2:09:44] hour about the condition of the day
[2:09:46] about our political country you see the
[2:09:49] lady in purple you see the test tubes
[2:09:52] you see them going hiding out and
[2:09:54] locking themselves away you see
[2:09:56] everything that's been said
[2:09:59] come to pass and you're still in
[2:10:02] question
[2:10:04] whether this is a worthy investment
[2:10:11] what are you holding on to
[2:10:17] that
[2:10:18] isn't it Worthy
[2:10:21] in other words this young man looked at
[2:10:23] it and he wasn't interested
[2:10:28] I'm sorry
[2:10:29] I'm really not interested
[2:10:32] I've determined
[2:10:36] that it's the truth
[2:10:39] I've determined
[2:10:41] that the judgment
[2:10:43] and the the the test
[2:10:48] of the investment is true
[2:10:54] see knowing that it's true didn't help
[2:10:57] him
[2:11:01] it was the cost
[2:11:05] of the Eternal Bond
[2:11:08] it was the cost
[2:11:10] of the title deed
[2:11:13] it was the cost of the abstract he
[2:11:16] wasn't willing to pay
[2:11:19] the price for eternal life
[2:11:26] now I'm just talking about attitude this
[2:11:28] morning
[2:11:29] are you willing
[2:11:32] to pay the price
[2:11:36] to invest
[2:11:38] in the rapture
[2:11:43] and we look at them
[2:11:46] right when we when we think about it and
[2:11:48] we see what that what that he did and
[2:11:52] and what where he was at he saw the test
[2:11:55] he saw it was good he saw it was
[2:11:58] everything but he didn't want to give up
[2:12:01] his traditions
[2:12:05] this is how he says it
[2:12:08] so this young man
[2:12:11] because paragraph 47 so this young man
[2:12:13] has seen the Lord Jesus and know that he
[2:12:17] held the keys to his eternal life
[2:12:25] am I drawing the picture good
[2:12:27] right this time come from a wealthy home
[2:12:30] he'd come from a religious background he
[2:12:33] had a lot to give and the only thing
[2:12:36] that would free him from that devil
[2:12:40] of where he was going and where that
[2:12:44] life was going to take him was for him
[2:12:47] to sell everything that he had
[2:12:53] Jesus didn't say that out of spite
[2:12:57] that would make him a liar
[2:13:01] and you can't have anything more than
[2:13:03] truth look at what happened to him
[2:13:10] he missed it
[2:13:13] and he found himself screaming out of
[2:13:16] the fires of Hell send Lazarus
[2:13:22] huh
[2:13:24] sorry
[2:13:25] you didn't invest
[2:13:29] you didn't put into it
[2:13:31] what was necessary
[2:13:33] so you've reaped what you sow
[2:13:41] a pardon's not a pardon
[2:13:44] until it's accepted as a pardon
[2:13:47] a revelation only takes on life when you
[2:13:52] accept it as being from God and not
[2:13:55] being intellect
[2:14:04] hey I don't want to go there alone
[2:14:07] I can't go there alone
[2:14:11] you are part of my inheritance
[2:14:16] it's all or none with God
[2:14:21] we're all gone
[2:14:24] so we all better invest in it
[2:14:27] we all got to see we're a part of it and
[2:14:30] that that elect lady will invest but he
[2:14:33] didn't want to he you know what he said
[2:14:35] he said he he had the keys to eternal
[2:14:38] life but he turned down the opportunity
[2:14:41] to make his investment he wasn't
[2:14:44] interested in such an investment
[2:14:48] although
[2:14:50] he was well identified that he was the
[2:14:53] son of God
[2:14:54] is perfectly identified the Virgin had
[2:14:58] conceived brought forth the son he had
[2:15:01] done every sign the Messiah was supposed
[2:15:03] to do this guy knew he had it
[2:15:10] his Revelation was so deep
[2:15:15] that he knew he was the result of the
[2:15:19] Virgin birth
[2:15:25] are you sold out
[2:15:28] that that's Malachi 4 5.
[2:15:30] that's the angel of Revelations 10 7 are
[2:15:34] you sold out are you so absolute true
[2:15:37] that he's the absolute that there's one
[2:15:40] voice one Prophet Messenger to each age
[2:15:43] and that profit messenger has what the
[2:15:46] spirit of God is saying to that age
[2:15:53] or are you weighing your Investments
[2:15:58] are you looking at other opportunities
[2:16:09] I just can't believe God put Adrian up
[2:16:12] here to say what he said
[2:16:16] that's in the mouth of two or three
[2:16:18] Witnesses
[2:16:22] under pressure
[2:16:28] and indebtedness
[2:16:35] he had a way out
[2:16:38] he called me I said Adrian well tell
[2:16:40] them both if you need to because your
[2:16:43] mother is sick that's true
[2:16:46] but he said I but I can't leave out the
[2:16:49] other I said well good tell them both
[2:16:52] now he can choose which one he wants
[2:16:56] Adrian walked in here said God told me
[2:16:58] not to go amen
[2:17:01] buddy you are crazy
[2:17:05] but you know something he was willing to
[2:17:08] pay the price if it cost him his job
[2:17:14] his career
[2:17:16] everything
[2:17:23] but let me tell you there's fiction
[2:17:25] it'll be a tremendous Liberty
[2:17:28] amongst the Spanish people people
[2:17:31] speaking people that have been in nickel
[2:17:34] lady and bondage and that man back there
[2:17:37] that paid that price is a great part of
[2:17:40] their Deliverance
[2:17:41] [Music]
[2:17:48] but he wasn't willing
[2:17:51] to give up his traditions
[2:17:55] now
[2:17:56] our little pea brain thinks he wasn't
[2:17:59] willing to give his religion that wasn't
[2:18:01] his traditions
[2:18:04] his Traditions was who he hung out with
[2:18:07] who we did business with
[2:18:12] that was his tradition it was his way of
[2:18:16] life
[2:18:17] Jesus was asking him come change your
[2:18:22] way of life
[2:18:25] he said Lord can I just give
[2:18:28] no I don't want you to give I don't want
[2:18:31] you to use your money I want you to sell
[2:18:33] all your money you follow me you won't
[2:18:36] need it
[2:18:39] because down the road I'm going to give
[2:18:41] a power
[2:18:43] down the road I'm going to give a return
[2:18:46] on your investment
[2:18:51] but here he is he doesn't want to give
[2:18:53] it up he doesn't want to give up his
[2:18:55] life he doesn't want to get about what
[2:18:56] he does on Saturday he doesn't want to
[2:18:59] do what he does on on the morning where
[2:19:01] he meets with the guys and he discusses
[2:19:03] his business he doesn't want to give up
[2:19:05] the power and the authority he doesn't
[2:19:07] want to give up his position
[2:19:11] oh that's too much
[2:19:15] it was such a strong pull
[2:19:18] he he knew that was the prophet he
[2:19:22] actually knew that was the Virgin that
[2:19:26] was promised by Isaiah brother
[2:19:27] Birmingham just said he did
[2:19:33] wouldn't pay it
[2:19:36] now that scares me
[2:19:39] could ask me one question what am I
[2:19:42] holding on to
[2:19:44] who am I how did I get here and what
[2:19:48] condition I'm in right now where am I
[2:19:50] going to be with it
[2:19:53] and it might behoove me to invest a
[2:19:56] little bit
[2:19:57] and investigate a little bit and find
[2:20:01] out if I have I have been up an
[2:20:03] investment opportunity that I need to
[2:20:06] make into the rapture
[2:20:13] but we just don't want to hear
[2:20:17] it's too unusual
[2:20:20] every other voice is saying live any way
[2:20:22] you want to you can live any way you
[2:20:24] want to God's going to come get you he
[2:20:27] said he was going to come kill you you
[2:20:29] don't have to invest in it it's free
[2:20:32] no it's not free
[2:20:35] the opportunity for you was paid for
[2:20:44] you think when he said come follow me
[2:20:50] Matthew had the opportunity you don't
[2:20:52] think Matthew heard
[2:20:55] you have some fairy tale uh
[2:20:59] two watching too many movies how it went
[2:21:05] Matthew knew who that guy was
[2:21:08] he knew how he paid his taxes
[2:21:13] he had a full understanding
[2:21:16] and when he started seeing Jesus come
[2:21:18] down that street he was going whoa
[2:21:21] you think he was just all smiles I'll
[2:21:23] tell you what he was he was shaking in
[2:21:25] his boots
[2:21:27] that seed that was in him started the
[2:21:30] pulsate
[2:21:31] he could feel it all over him
[2:21:34] [Music]
[2:21:38] isn't it that was the prophet of God
[2:21:40] told us we've got to learn to understand
[2:21:42] that pulsation
[2:21:45] that call began to wreak reap in him he
[2:21:49] thought oh no look at this guy he's
[2:21:52] different he's unusual
[2:21:54] he pays his taxes out of fish bellies
[2:22:01] he did
[2:22:04] you know he's a guy that told them I
[2:22:08] thought we were going to attack get him
[2:22:10] on tax evasion
[2:22:13] or tax conspiracy and he said oh whose
[2:22:16] image has done that render to Caesar the
[2:22:18] things that are Caesar to God the things
[2:22:20] of the God why do you think they trapped
[2:22:22] them
[2:22:27] they may have even tried to throw the
[2:22:29] Trap
[2:22:31] at the advice of the position that
[2:22:34] Matthew had
[2:22:37] Matthew may have been the very guy
[2:22:40] that set the trap to Jesus to fulfill
[2:22:43] the tax laws
[2:22:45] but we're living in a religious Bible
[2:22:48] story fake fantasy
[2:22:53] it's time to bring this gospel down to
[2:22:56] earth
[2:22:57] and ask ourselves do I have that life or
[2:23:01] have I invested in it
[2:23:08] you just don't put a sign around your
[2:23:11] neck and say I'm a Christian I'm going
[2:23:13] in the Rapture that's a get quick Rich
[2:23:16] scheme
[2:23:19] and any preacher that's offering you
[2:23:22] that
[2:23:24] is offering you a sensation
[2:23:28] is offering you a free ticket
[2:23:34] is lying to you
[2:23:38] the kingdom of God is taken with Force
[2:23:43] you've got to possess the gates of the
[2:23:45] enemy you have got to fight the Mind
[2:23:47] battle you have got to make it sound you
[2:23:50] have got to make a decision you've got
[2:23:53] to invest your life you've got to die
[2:24:04] but he didn't want to pay the clock cost
[2:24:10] he said but in order
[2:24:13] to accept him
[2:24:15] he had to get away from all his
[2:24:18] traditions
[2:24:19] he had to turn away from it and we don't
[2:24:23] want to turn away from our dish video
[2:24:25] game tradition
[2:24:28] Cowboy game tradition
[2:24:31] Sports tradition
[2:24:34] music tradition
[2:24:36] I love Christians today so what they do
[2:24:39] is I I'll tell you I'm standing right
[2:24:41] here I witnessed it exactly for myself
[2:24:45] I went into the Christian bookstore the
[2:24:47] one that used to be on that Big Church
[2:24:49] where Trinity Broadcasting was I went in
[2:24:53] there and they had a great big wreck
[2:24:55] and it said if you like Dolly Parton
[2:24:59] here are the Christian musicians that's
[2:25:01] got her sound
[2:25:04] and they listed worldly art after
[2:25:08] worldly artists and the music that was
[2:25:11] done in their Style
[2:25:17] now I'm not going to start a music
[2:25:19] Crusade
[2:25:22] I'm just saying it's so close
[2:25:25] to the
[2:25:27] the very elect it would deceive the very
[2:25:30] elective was possible
[2:25:33] that's why he said you have to examine
[2:25:35] the investment
[2:25:37] and examine the return
[2:25:47] God doesn't ask for an investment
[2:25:52] if you leave your father and mother if
[2:25:54] you give it'll be given to you a
[2:25:56] hundredfold in this life or the life to
[2:25:59] come
[2:26:02] come follow me bury your cross
[2:26:07] Satan has desired to Sifty like sand but
[2:26:11] I have prayed for you
[2:26:16] I mean we're starting to to preach this
[2:26:19] message like it's a free ticket
[2:26:27] Christian Life Tabernacle Baptist
[2:26:30] message believers
[2:26:33] nothing against the Baptist they're
[2:26:35] sincere and I believe there's a reward
[2:26:37] for them based on what they've done
[2:26:41] but but the the problem is is is that
[2:26:45] they they don't want to move up
[2:26:50] that that's what he said he said he says
[2:26:53] he said just listen to this
[2:26:56] he says that's where the where we people
[2:27:00] have got we've joined Church which is
[2:27:03] all right
[2:27:04] we do those things but you say you are a
[2:27:07] Christian I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist
[2:27:10] I'm a presbyterian I'm a Pentecostal or
[2:27:13] something else it's a tradition
[2:27:17] and there's no
[2:27:20] entering in sincerity anymore
[2:27:26] unless you don't have to be sincere
[2:27:28] anymore
[2:27:33] you don't have to get you don't don't
[2:27:35] have the preacher put any heat on us
[2:27:40] I don't want to put the heat on you
[2:27:43] but I've got something I've got to meet
[2:27:49] and I have got to be able to stand on
[2:27:52] that day and said I have declared unto
[2:27:55] them the Full Gospel
[2:27:57] I never put my thoughts in it I read to
[2:28:00] him what your messenger said because I
[2:28:03] have enough against me on that day
[2:28:08] and if I can just get in on that I'm
[2:28:10] going to do my best
[2:28:14] if that's the only place I can invest
[2:28:16] I'm going to give it my all
[2:28:23] he said
[2:28:24] they won't move up
[2:28:29] cope up
[2:28:30] with the scriptures and things they just
[2:28:34] live any way they want to
[2:28:41] and the rest of it
[2:28:44] you know
[2:28:46] so they they don't they don't want to
[2:28:48] move up
[2:28:50] they don't want to get
[2:28:52] any stronger
[2:28:54] any higher
[2:28:57] any more spiritual
[2:29:00] they they they they don't want to gain
[2:29:02] something
[2:29:04] you invest to gain
[2:29:08] you don't put a hundred dollars into
[2:29:11] something at the promise of getting a
[2:29:15] gain and didn't get a hundred dollars
[2:29:17] back
[2:29:20] I don't want to put an investment into
[2:29:23] something that has a losing record
[2:29:31] that has continued to fail
[2:29:35] and man has continued to fail in every
[2:29:39] age
[2:29:42] you want to invest in Civilization look
[2:29:45] at it
[2:29:47] Civilization now
[2:29:50] this is so scary
[2:29:54] but we don't want to cope with it
[2:29:57] we don't want to move up
[2:29:59] we don't want to take these thoughts
[2:30:01] into our investment strategy
[2:30:04] we don't want none of the truth of
[2:30:06] things to determine how we're going to
[2:30:09] live or how we're going to change our
[2:30:10] life or how we're going to change our
[2:30:12] attitude
[2:30:14] but they're passing a law now in
[2:30:16] California
[2:30:18] If the child under your roof
[2:30:23] decides that they want to be called she
[2:30:26] instead of HE
[2:30:28] and you withstand it the state can take
[2:30:32] it away from you
[2:30:38] that's the world
[2:30:40] that you're investing in
[2:30:50] that you can steal up to eight hundred
[2:30:53] dollars
[2:30:54] free of charge
[2:30:57] that's the world you know what it's all
[2:30:59] fine tell it you're eight hundred
[2:31:01] dollars
[2:31:02] all those people in New York oh let them
[2:31:05] come in it's wonderful we're the Open
[2:31:08] Country uh we're uh what do they call
[2:31:12] that a sanctuary City
[2:31:16] some little guy in a wheelchair in Texas
[2:31:19] decided to send 200 000 of the 2 million
[2:31:23] he had
[2:31:24] he only gave him ten percent perfectly
[2:31:27] scriptural
[2:31:33] and all of a sudden it's on their dirt
[2:31:34] oh we got to do something oh we got to
[2:31:38] do something to close the border close
[2:31:40] the barter
[2:31:44] well if 200 000 worked send them 200 000
[2:31:48] more
[2:31:51] you get more return
[2:31:54] this is what's going on
[2:31:59] this is what the bride
[2:32:02] of Jesus Christ is investing in it's
[2:32:05] investing in the world it's investing in
[2:32:08] their jobs it's investing in their their
[2:32:11] temporary future they're putting nothing
[2:32:14] into the kingdom of God
[2:32:17] nothing
[2:32:22] I'm thankful for the brothers that
[2:32:24] showed up
[2:32:25] the other day
[2:32:29] I I'm thankful
[2:32:32] well you know I I just wonder sometimes
[2:32:37] they don't want to move up spiritually
[2:32:41] the investment has got returned
[2:32:45] it's got gain
[2:32:47] it makes you stronger
[2:32:51] so the the more you put in the more you
[2:32:54] get out of it
[2:32:56] that's a quote you know that
[2:32:59] you get in you get out of it exactly
[2:33:02] what you put into it if you've come to
[2:33:05] find something to criticize you'll find
[2:33:07] something to criticize
[2:33:10] if you come looking for the spirit to
[2:33:13] move if you've come for God to speak to
[2:33:15] your heart if you've come to sit back
[2:33:17] and watch how the psalm how the
[2:33:20] testimony and how the scriptures all fit
[2:33:23] together and you can't see God in it
[2:33:26] you've got blinded because you've got
[2:33:28] you've not taken the isab for this day
[2:33:31] you haven't put on the gold Trident fire
[2:33:38] you haven't clothed yourself in white
[2:33:40] randomly you want you didn't want to
[2:33:43] invest in it you didn't pray this
[2:33:45] morning you didn't read the scripture if
[2:33:47] I sat in this church and the prophet
[2:33:49] preached to me out of the
[2:33:52] the Palmer worm the Caper and Ida went
[2:33:55] home and read it
[2:33:56] I would have got on the same page
[2:33:59] but you'll walk out of here and you
[2:34:01] won't remember it because you've got
[2:34:03] something else to invest in and you
[2:34:06] don't believe he's here
[2:34:09] that he could Veil himself in something
[2:34:12] like this
[2:34:13] that can't speak that can't talk right
[2:34:16] that can't raise the emotional
[2:34:19] excitement
[2:34:25] we can't even seem veiled in flesh
[2:34:29] not just me all of you
[2:34:34] in one another's lives
[2:34:40] Adrian may not be a genius
[2:34:43] when it comes to all the scriptures I
[2:34:46] don't know but he knew when God talked
[2:34:53] he recognized the word
[2:34:55] in its day
[2:34:57] and he invested into it
[2:35:01] what do you think he's got coming I say
[2:35:03] by the word of God he's got a hundred
[2:35:05] fold in this life and the life to come
[2:35:12] what do you got in it
[2:35:15] how much prayer do you have in it
[2:35:23] I did somebody else mentioned tide say I
[2:35:27] never
[2:35:29] but he said
[2:35:31] you do it
[2:35:34] that gets an investment
[2:35:38] you know prayer is not used just to meet
[2:35:42] a momentary challenge
[2:35:47] prayer is Money in the Bank excuse that
[2:35:51] expression but the prophet of God said
[2:35:53] he says we got a whole account
[2:35:56] but we don't know how to write the check
[2:35:59] because we never invested in how to
[2:36:02] learn how to write the check we've never
[2:36:05] invested on the in the approach how do
[2:36:08] you approach them how about fasting
[2:36:10] about praying
[2:36:11] we don't do none of that we grab our
[2:36:14] school book and we bury our nose in it
[2:36:17] oh my goodness I'm I'm going to learn
[2:36:20] this I'm going to go take this test and
[2:36:21] I'm going to make seventy thousand
[2:36:23] dollars a year
[2:36:26] that's poverty
[2:36:32] you know why he's going to do that to
[2:36:35] the world because God came to the poor
[2:36:38] in this world rich in faith
[2:36:43] so you better invest in something that's
[2:36:46] not going to lose its value
[2:36:51] but if you invest in the world it loses
[2:36:53] its value it loses its value every day
[2:36:57] you know another thing that makes you
[2:36:59] lose your value is age
[2:37:03] I had a guy there to tell me I'm stuck
[2:37:05] with this job because nobody's hiring
[2:37:07] anybody over 50.
[2:37:10] I say you've got the wrong recruiter
[2:37:14] you get Jesus Christ as your recruiter
[2:37:16] he'll find you a job when you're 99.
[2:37:24] why because his investment said I shall
[2:37:28] not see the righteous big bread
[2:37:36] it says word
[2:37:38] but if you don't invest in that policy
[2:37:43] if you don't take that policy and invest
[2:37:47] in that until that becomes a reality on
[2:37:50] your heart
[2:37:51] then you're wanting it to produce a
[2:37:54] return on its own and you don't have any
[2:37:56] skin in the game
[2:38:01] you understand that
[2:38:05] you know
[2:38:07] you know if somebody offers to sell you
[2:38:10] a card zero percent down and you can't
[2:38:13] make the payment you know what they know
[2:38:16] they've inflated that car to you
[2:38:19] you're going to lose it and they can
[2:38:21] sell it again
[2:38:23] you're just a pawn in their game
[2:38:28] if you really love somebody you won't
[2:38:30] let them get into that position
[2:38:38] but they don't want to gain something
[2:38:42] they don't want to invest prayer is
[2:38:44] Money in the Bank
[2:38:46] you look you don't you you it builds up
[2:38:49] and it builds up and it builds up and
[2:38:52] one day you got to make a withdrawal but
[2:38:54] it's there to withdraw
[2:38:57] you can all of a sudden run you get in
[2:38:59] the back like oh God oh God please help
[2:39:01] me out of this mind I'm so bad Oh Lord
[2:39:04] You're so wonderful you're I believe you
[2:39:06] I believe you now
[2:39:12] but why didn't you put money in the
[2:39:14] account
[2:39:15] I've got nothing to draw on
[2:39:19] that little boy when he is in court he
[2:39:22] said your honor I stand on my record he
[2:39:25] says that's a problem son you don't have
[2:39:27] one
[2:39:29] you want to go on the Rapture you don't
[2:39:31] have a record of prayer you don't have a
[2:39:33] record of fasting you don't have a
[2:39:35] record of trying to win souls you try
[2:39:37] you know why you don't believe it
[2:39:39] you do not believe
[2:39:44] that there is going to be a translation
[2:39:47] of your body and there is a people that
[2:39:50] are going to leave this earth there are
[2:39:52] people that come from God and are going
[2:39:55] to God
[2:39:55] [Applause]
[2:39:57] you're not sold out
[2:40:01] you got hope so
[2:40:06] it's okay to
[2:40:08] have hope so
[2:40:10] but today
[2:40:12] There's an opportunity
[2:40:16] being presented to you to reconsider
[2:40:20] your investment strategy
[2:40:23] [Music]
[2:40:30] I like this
[2:40:31] investment
[2:40:33] I want to cope up
[2:40:37] hey man I
[2:40:40] I want to cut away my traditions
[2:40:43] I want to cut away the things that are
[2:40:45] keeping me from moving up
[2:40:47] but I want to return
[2:40:51] you understand
[2:40:53] that
[2:40:54] if you don't invest prophet of God said
[2:40:57] it's not good to keep your money in your
[2:40:59] pocket it'll be stolen now you just
[2:41:01] maybe think about someone going in and
[2:41:03] stealing the money out of your pocket
[2:41:05] because I don't know I usually don't
[2:41:07] bring my wall it's strange that I have
[2:41:09] it I have five dollars here
[2:41:18] you know I can turn this five dollars
[2:41:20] into 50.
[2:41:24] you don't think I can
[2:41:26] you need five dollars
[2:41:28] you don't you need five dollars
[2:41:31] you need five dollars EJ
[2:41:33] have need of nothing
[2:41:42] I could say this five dollars just for
[2:41:44] the first person that comes up here and
[2:41:46] gets it
[2:41:47] you know what I know I'm getting 50 back
[2:41:55] Lord showed me a long time ago if I turn
[2:41:57] off the faucet the water stops flowing
[2:42:04] I give 200 I got 400.
[2:42:07] I give a thousand I got a thousand to
[2:42:10] give oh I don't got a thousand for me
[2:42:12] I'm never turning it off
[2:42:17] let it flow
[2:42:19] because you cannot out give God
[2:42:22] but
[2:42:25] do you know what this five dollars would
[2:42:27] have bought you two years ago
[2:42:29] two gallons
[2:42:32] of gasoline
[2:42:37] now what does it buy
[2:42:39] one
[2:42:41] half of this
[2:42:43] has been stolen from me
[2:42:48] it's called inflation
[2:42:53] and if you don't continue
[2:42:55] to invest
[2:42:57] so you have 10 instead of five
[2:43:03] inflation
[2:43:05] will take the worth
[2:43:07] of everything you have away from you
[2:43:11] and the world the inflation inflation
[2:43:15] means inflated it means the increase the
[2:43:19] more abundance of
[2:43:22] in other words the cost of food has gone
[2:43:24] up the cost of gas has gone up the cost
[2:43:28] of clothing has gone up and all of a
[2:43:32] sudden your money can't buy what it used
[2:43:34] to buy
[2:43:37] you know what most people do
[2:43:40] I get a hundred dollar checks a month
[2:43:43] I'm grateful for them it's not my money
[2:43:45] it's God's money I just can't believe
[2:43:47] that's all you're living on
[2:43:50] you're living on a thousand dollars a
[2:43:52] month
[2:43:54] you're a miracle
[2:43:56] or you've been robbing from somebody
[2:44:02] I'm sorry I'm just talking about making
[2:44:04] the Rapture you don't have to make the
[2:44:06] rapture
[2:44:08] you don't have to invest
[2:44:11] I'm not talking about salvation
[2:44:13] I'm talking about an investment above
[2:44:16] salvation
[2:44:21] I'm talking about I'm not missing this
[2:44:22] flight
[2:44:25] amen
[2:44:28] but I have a fall black Plan
[2:44:30] I remember a guy came to me and said God
[2:44:32] told me to go to this meeting over here
[2:44:37] he said but if I can't get a ride I'm
[2:44:39] going to this meeting
[2:44:40] you had an Exit Plan
[2:44:43] from the will of God
[2:44:47] I had started walking
[2:44:49] and I'd say God if you told me to be
[2:44:52] there I'm going to have a Philip
[2:44:54] experience
[2:45:00] if God said so
[2:45:03] how many Believers are rapture
[2:45:07] so if you don't it'll shrink will be
[2:45:10] evil
[2:45:12] of the world
[2:45:15] you understand it would get so wicked
[2:45:19] that the righteous would scarcely be
[2:45:22] saved
[2:45:24] so your spiritual condition
[2:45:28] can no longer meet the challenge of the
[2:45:31] hour
[2:45:36] you've got to start investing more in
[2:45:39] your spiritual condition
[2:45:41] else your spiritual experience will
[2:45:44] inflate
[2:45:46] and now it won't be worth anything it
[2:45:49] won't be able to move a devil
[2:45:52] it won't be able to heal the sick it
[2:45:55] won't be able to deliver your family it
[2:45:57] won't be able you to sit down with your
[2:45:59] child and lead them to the Lord
[2:46:03] it will be
[2:46:05] worthless
[2:46:11] I don't want to be worthless
[2:46:15] how can I be relevant
[2:46:18] how can I meet the challenge is to
[2:46:21] revest invest in something that's got
[2:46:23] returned
[2:46:25] a return on my investment
[2:46:28] I want to invest in something that'll
[2:46:31] give power to heal the sick I want to
[2:46:34] invest in something that'll keep me
[2:46:36] through hard times that'll give me peace
[2:46:39] and joy I want to invest in something
[2:46:42] that'll defeat Satan depression
[2:46:44] weariness anxiety something that'll
[2:46:47] guide me counsel me and comfort me
[2:46:52] that's what I want to invest in
[2:46:55] I need the returns
[2:46:59] that'll fight
[2:47:01] the enemy of this hour
[2:47:07] and you can't live on yesterday's manna
[2:47:12] that's why he put it spiritual food in
[2:47:16] due season in a warehouse so his Spirit
[2:47:21] can go in here at the time it was needed
[2:47:24] take this message out and tell my people
[2:47:28] they're not investing in eternal life
[2:47:37] they're not getting any returns
[2:47:41] on the religious experience
[2:47:44] that they're living
[2:47:46] in fact their experience is shrinking
[2:47:52] Satan's robbing it from them robbing it
[2:47:55] from them they have less power
[2:47:58] less faith
[2:48:01] less belief
[2:48:03] less self-esteem
[2:48:06] more doubt
[2:48:07] more fear
[2:48:09] why
[2:48:11] they didn't continue investing and
[2:48:15] they're investing shrunk
[2:48:24] I don't want the church to shrink
[2:48:30] you know the scripture says
[2:48:32] wherever two are gathered together there
[2:48:36] all be
[2:48:37] he sent them out in pairs
[2:48:39] because the Bible says two are better
[2:48:41] and one if one Falls who would lift them
[2:48:44] up
[2:48:46] I don't want to be the only one
[2:48:50] if I'm going to take on a high risk
[2:48:52] investment
[2:48:54] and I need to raise capital I don't put
[2:48:57] all mine in it I get 15 people
[2:49:00] to join with me
[2:49:04] can I give the church today
[2:49:08] to join with me in investing in the
[2:49:11] rapture
[2:49:15] that the power of God would move
[2:49:19] can I apply the token
[2:49:22] can I kick out the cigarettes kick out
[2:49:24] the wine kick out this kick out that go
[2:49:27] in there and say I'm getting rid of all
[2:49:29] these things that are investing me that
[2:49:32] are depriving me that are inflating my
[2:49:35] experience that are making my experience
[2:49:37] of no value no power no good to me
[2:49:43] I'm going to change that out with prayer
[2:49:46] and reading my Bible and investing and
[2:49:49] looking after my brother and laying a
[2:49:52] pattern of good works
[2:49:55] go home sit down and write me a list of
[2:49:57] your good works
[2:50:01] I hope it takes five pins
[2:50:04] to do it but I don't hope you're not
[2:50:07] sitting there going to go to church
[2:50:09] uh
[2:50:11] I read my Bible that's all you
[2:50:16] it's all about you
[2:50:19] what have you done for somebody else
[2:50:21] what soul have you on you know how much
[2:50:23] winning assault's worth ten thousand
[2:50:26] worlds
[2:50:27] if you could get ten thousand worlds
[2:50:29] would you invest in ten thousand worlds
[2:50:31] if I could give you ten thousand
[2:50:33] Caribbean islands and all it took was to
[2:50:35] win one soul to Christ
[2:50:39] I'm telling the world
[2:50:45] if you don't invest
[2:50:48] spiritually
[2:50:50] what you have shrinks
[2:50:52] in this hour
[2:50:55] I was afraid
[2:51:01] he said he took from them
[2:51:04] that did nothing
[2:51:06] and gave it to the one who was willing
[2:51:09] to invest
[2:51:12] foreign
[2:51:15] does it pay off
[2:51:17] let's read with me this last paragraph
[2:51:21] and we'll close
[2:51:24] if I could stand in my own defense the
[2:51:26] prophet of God said sometimes you just
[2:51:28] got to clinch it down
[2:51:34] the message has been made clear to us
[2:51:38] it's undoubtedly
[2:51:42] the angel
[2:51:43] of Revelation 10 7 has failed himself in
[2:51:47] this messenger
[2:51:49] the prophetic scripture of Malachi 4 5
[2:51:53] has come to pass in this body called
[2:51:57] William Branham
[2:52:02] you say he's no longer here
[2:52:05] he didn't come to be here he came to
[2:52:09] leave a message
[2:52:11] Revelation and stored up food and the
[2:52:16] investment opportunity for who's ever
[2:52:19] willing to invest
[2:52:23] foreign
[2:52:30] he said Jesus said this is 99 Jesus said
[2:52:34] to that woman
[2:52:36] you may be a virtuous as you can be
[2:52:40] but you'll answer for adultery in that
[2:52:42] day of judgment
[2:52:44] for wearing those clothes
[2:52:46] Jesus said whoever looketh upon a woman
[2:52:49] and lust after her he has committed
[2:52:52] adultery with her already in his heart
[2:52:55] you think she would have invested in
[2:52:58] some new clothing
[2:53:00] loser look
[2:53:03] lose the image of herself in the mirror
[2:53:08] you ever see these people that have
[2:53:09] these real old heritages from years ago
[2:53:12] because they think they look pretty in
[2:53:14] that
[2:53:15] they won't move up they won't cope
[2:53:20] they don't want a change of tradition
[2:53:23] they don't want to change the style
[2:53:28] with their already
[2:53:32] in his heart no matter how innocent you
[2:53:36] are
[2:53:36] that sinner will answer for adultery and
[2:53:40] you'll be the one presented it
[2:53:44] you say I can't help what he thinks
[2:53:47] you presented the opportunity
[2:53:50] you sisters who continue to wear high
[2:53:52] heels
[2:53:54] and you continue to wear tight dresses
[2:54:00] you will answer for adultery
[2:54:03] I don't care how many pictures of the
[2:54:06] pillar or fire you hang in a wall you
[2:54:09] know why you do it you love it
[2:54:12] you love the man whale makes you look
[2:54:14] you think if you can get those heels up
[2:54:18] like this the back side of you won't
[2:54:20] look so big
[2:54:26] you're ate up and investing in the wrong
[2:54:29] thing
[2:54:30] you can put makeup on to cover those
[2:54:33] wrinkles all you want
[2:54:35] that might last for 20 years but one day
[2:54:38] when you wash your face it's more
[2:54:40] wrinkled than the prune
[2:54:45] would you take a sister that's not worn
[2:54:47] makeup all her life she gets up there
[2:54:50] that Skin's Fair it might have wrinkles
[2:54:52] in it but it's right in those who look
[2:54:55] upon the Lord are radiant
[2:55:00] they just didn't want to invest
[2:55:04] in a little temporary shame
[2:55:07] a little reproach they didn't want to
[2:55:10] Bear it they didn't want to identify it
[2:55:12] like the little boy logging cap what did
[2:55:14] they do when they found out you were a
[2:55:16] Christian oh don't worry mommy they
[2:55:18] never found out
[2:55:30] see
[2:55:34] she said
[2:55:36] no matter how innocent you are you
[2:55:38] Christians aren't you ashamed
[2:55:41] you should act like Daughters of God
[2:55:44] and you man members of the church
[2:55:47] deacons even to ministers will permit
[2:55:50] your lives to do that you should be sons
[2:55:52] and of God
[2:55:54] it don't sound like the behavior of a
[2:55:57] Son of God with nature of his father in
[2:56:01] him afraid to say something because the
[2:56:05] organization would turn you out that's
[2:56:08] right
[2:56:09] now listen to this
[2:56:12] we're going to talk about the return
[2:56:15] on investment
[2:56:18] Daniel purposed in his heart
[2:56:21] that he wasn't going to defile his
[2:56:24] investment
[2:56:26] he purposed no matter what the world how
[2:56:31] rich the king gets how much he tries to
[2:56:35] get me off of the things of the world
[2:56:39] I'm going I'm not going to do it I'm
[2:56:43] going to I am not going to defile my
[2:56:49] investment
[2:56:50] oh Christian world don't defile your
[2:56:55] investment that you've made in eternal
[2:56:58] life you'll pollute it
[2:57:04] he said Daniel purpose
[2:57:07] he wouldn't do it it paid off
[2:57:11] by Saving his life when he was thrown
[2:57:14] into the lion's dead his investment
[2:57:18] really paid off
[2:57:22] yeah man
[2:57:25] the Hebrew children
[2:57:27] were determined
[2:57:29] that they would not worship an idol and
[2:57:32] it paid off by saving their life in the
[2:57:36] fiery furnace
[2:57:40] the investment pays off
[2:57:44] are you investing today in something
[2:57:47] that will pay off
[2:57:50] not only in the life to come but in this
[2:57:54] life I'm telling you invest in the word
[2:57:58] of God because what the world's fixing
[2:58:01] to do
[2:58:02] and force on us you'll have something
[2:58:06] that can meet the challenge of the day
[2:58:08] and make a payoff
[2:58:11] I I I call you as your brother
[2:58:15] ask yourself everything thinking man
[2:58:19] sits back and asks himself
[2:58:22] where did I come from
