[51:02] cream small crowd ice
[51:05] cream that's our motto you know so you
[51:10] got to reward them that come out to the
[51:13] house of the Lord amen we have a lot of
[51:16] surprises coming up for us uh we're
[51:19] going to get our oven in and the Lord's
[51:22] blessed us with a baker amen and so
[51:25] we're going to have
[51:28] uh all kinds of goodies for those that
[51:31] come to evening
[51:33] service so you
[51:35] know you got to believe that the Lord is
[51:39] a rewarder of them that diligently see
[51:42] him amen so uh anyway but anyway yes uh
[51:48] uh by
[51:50] Yahweh I learned that word I don't know
[51:52] what it means but it sure sounds good
[51:55] you know I could do that
[51:58] bye you know does it have an
[52:07] interpretation oh
[52:09] Jehovah ah I believe
[52:11] that amen is that
[52:16] SW
[52:17] huh oh man I've got a lot to
[52:21] learn I wonder how many languages we
[52:24] speak here if we have many Lang
[52:26] languages many countries but by one
[52:29] faith and one baptism amen amen so uh we
[52:35] just want to continue just a little on
[52:37] our Father's Day message it won't be
[52:39] long let's turn to Romans uh
[52:45] 416 and then we'll go to
[52:48] Galatians uh three and
[52:54] uh and so right do Romans
[52:59] 4:16 and then
[53:02] Galatians
[53:12] 3 just a couple short Scriptures it
[53:16] says in Galatians I mean in Romans 4:16
[53:21] therefore it is of
[53:23] faith that it might be by grace to the
[53:28] end the promise might be sure to all the
[53:34] seed not that only which
[53:37] is of the law but that which also is of
[53:43] the faith of Abraham who is the father
[53:48] of us all amen what a great scripture
[53:52] and then Galatians 3 we want to read
[53:56] this there in
[53:57] Galatians uh 3 and 16 it says now to
[54:03] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[54:08] made he saith not and to the seed as of
[54:13] many but as of one and to that thy seed
[54:18] which is
[54:19] Christ and this I say that the Covenant
[54:24] that was confirmed before of God in
[54:28] Christ the law which was
[54:32] 400 years 30 years after cannot be thus
[54:36] anold that it should make the promise of
[54:40] none effect for if the inheritance be of
[54:45] the law it is no more of promise but God
[54:49] gave it to Abraham by promise amen we
[54:55] ask Heavenly Father we ask to bless your
[54:57] word in your precious name we pray amen
[55:00] you may be
[55:05] seated you know I I I've firmly have in
[55:10] my heart just been uh it just seems like
[55:14] going back over the uh the Simplicity
[55:17] and the fundamentals of the message and
[55:21] what it is that we uh really are built
[55:24] on and I I one of of the things that I
[55:27] think many times it just seems to slip
[55:29] away from us is that Malachi 45 was to
[55:34] come and restore back the Faith of Our
[55:38] Fathers to our children and when we talk
[55:41] about the father uh uh of faith we talk
[55:45] about Abraham who is the the the father
[55:48] of us all the father of faith and you
[55:51] could hardly preach Father's day without
[55:53] preaching about Father Abraham you know
[55:57] and what that it was and what that it
[55:59] meant and I like what Paul was saying
[56:02] here he says you know it was given by
[56:04] promise and not by the law not by the
[56:07] rules and and not by what was kept but
[56:10] by faith and we know the scripture tells
[56:13] us without faith it's impossible to
[56:16] please God and and so the the the faith
[56:19] of Abraham is uh a kind of a different
[56:24] type of faith if I could say it that way
[56:26] way and uh and that's the faith that we
[56:30] want to have we want to have the type of
[56:33] faith that Abraham had and and and
[56:37] because that's the kind of faith that is
[56:41] going
[56:42] to cause us to become what it is that we
[56:47] can become and uh the only way that
[56:51] we'll ever reach our potential as
[56:53] Christians is by faith and and so when
[56:57] you look at Abraham and you think about
[56:59] Abraham you know the faith of Abraham
[57:03] was uh it was a h the faith that a
[57:07] nation was born out of and a people was
[57:11] born out of it the because of what
[57:15] Abraham uh
[57:18] believed and the faith that he had a
[57:21] whole nation came out of it and and out
[57:24] of that Nation came our Savior and out
[57:27] of our savior came the Gentile church
[57:30] and therefore Abraham's considered the
[57:33] father of us all if it wasn't for the
[57:35] faith of Abraham we would have never
[57:38] achieved that which uh was
[57:42] achieved and and so the IT thing is not
[57:46] so much to uh look at uh Abraham maybe
[57:50] as a man uh I didn't know Abraham as a
[57:53] man uh I I you know always have an idea
[57:57] what the personality of Abraham might be
[58:01] or who he might be like or what type of
[58:04] nature he might have had what was his
[58:07] dislikes and and likes you know did he
[58:10] like to eat did he like to exercise was
[58:13] he a hiker you know what I mean uh was
[58:17] he a businessman uh we know he must have
[58:19] been some form of businessman he was
[58:22] blessed of the Lord uh you know so you
[58:25] know or maybe he was uh kind of maybe
[58:28] what we would call a nerdy type uh I
[58:31] guess that's a okay go all right and uh
[58:34] you know or something like that or or uh
[58:38] you know maybe an intellect I I believe
[58:41] that Paul was intellectual you know what
[58:44] I mean he was smart he studied under Gia
[58:48] okay you know he I'm sure he had a wit
[58:50] and so we I don't know him by uh his
[58:54] personality but I am going to know him
[58:58] I'm going to meet Abraham someday and
[59:01] and just think I'm going to have time to
[59:03] sit down with them and and and and
[59:05] wonder you know uh just have fellowship
[59:08] with them and have them tell me the
[59:10] challenges he went through and what it
[59:13] was like and how God saw him through it
[59:15] all and and how he made it and uh and
[59:20] just tell him he says Abraham uh you
[59:23] were considered to us the Gentiles as
[59:27] the father of our faith and from you all
[59:31] Faith came uh the promise came even the
[59:35] promise of the son of our savior came
[59:38] through the promise that God gave you it
[59:41] was that your faith that
[59:44] started uh if we use that expression the
[59:47] ball rolling it started the program uh
[59:51] and and and and I wanted to look at that
[59:54] faith that Abraham had uh really uh and
[1:00:00] and this is the faith that I believe
[1:00:03] that God is wanting us to have we talked
[1:00:07] this morning about him being our father
[1:00:11] the Our God our Father and the
[1:00:15] relationship that God wants us to have
[1:00:18] with him as a father we he wants us to
[1:00:21] feel like his children he wants us to
[1:00:24] act like his children he wants us to
[1:00:27] feel like we can approach him like his
[1:00:30] children he wants us to know that he
[1:00:33] loves us like his children and not like
[1:00:37] but that we are his children that we're
[1:00:40] the reason that he's here he
[1:00:42] predestinated us he put something in us
[1:00:45] to hear his word he he called our lives
[1:00:49] to to come to him and and so he he
[1:00:53] doesn't want to be worshiped a far off
[1:00:55] but and he doesn't want to be worshiped
[1:00:57] as as a God that's someplace that he
[1:01:01] can't be known but he wants us to know
[1:01:05] him and he wants us to love him for what
[1:01:08] that he is he's put his attributes on
[1:01:10] display so that we can know what kind of
[1:01:13] God he is we've seen it in the works
[1:01:16] that Jesus did all the works that Jesus
[1:01:19] did he said I didn't do these things of
[1:01:21] myself I did them because the father
[1:01:23] showed me to do them because and then he
[1:01:27] looked at Philip and he says Philip have
[1:01:29] I been so long with you and you know not
[1:01:31] who I am he who ha seen me has seen the
[1:01:35] father all I've been displaying to you
[1:01:38] was the Father's love God so loved the
[1:01:41] world he gave his only begotten son so
[1:01:44] we we see that that's what he was
[1:01:46] establishing he was establishing uh the
[1:01:51] understanding that we could approach him
[1:01:55] and have the love affair with him and
[1:01:57] the relationship with
[1:02:00] him above a religious
[1:02:03] relationship or something that would be
[1:02:06] considered uh you know through a form of
[1:02:09] worship that he wanted it to be personal
[1:02:13] real personal really set in your heart
[1:02:16] that you're not alone amen I won't leave
[1:02:20] you I won't forsake you I'll be there
[1:02:22] for you I'll be there with you he want
[1:02:26] us to understand that we've got a a a
[1:02:29] Jehovah gy we've got a
[1:02:31] provider aen that he want us to feel
[1:02:35] that
[1:02:36] warmth and that comfort and that
[1:02:40] satisfaction that my daddy's not far
[1:02:43] away you know I have my father my
[1:02:46] father's looking over at me and and and
[1:02:50] if I Stray his loving hand will will
[1:02:54] reach out and keep me me and the F so he
[1:02:57] wants us to have that kind of of
[1:03:00] relationship with him and so and in that
[1:03:04] relationship he wants us to have faith
[1:03:08] in him and confidence in him and that
[1:03:12] was the faith that Abraham had Abraham
[1:03:16] had confidence in God and and and that
[1:03:19] Faith was imputed to him as
[1:03:23] righteousness that's in another words
[1:03:26] that's what made Abraham what he was is
[1:03:30] because he believed God and so we look a
[1:03:33] little bit at Abraham and the faith of
[1:03:36] Abraham so God wants us to have the
[1:03:39] relationship with him as a father and
[1:03:42] now he wants us to have the kind of
[1:03:44] faith that Abraham had so he wants us to
[1:03:49] have that love affair and then within
[1:03:52] that love affair he wants us to have
[1:03:55] faith yeah that all things are
[1:03:58] possible that's what pleases God that go
[1:04:02] God is a rewarder of them that
[1:04:05] diligently seek him that without th this
[1:04:08] Faith it's impossible to please God so
[1:04:13] if you want to please your
[1:04:16] father right this is Father's Day you
[1:04:19] know you give uh you give your your dad
[1:04:22] uh you know soap and stuff like that and
[1:04:26] deodorant and then he wonders if he
[1:04:28] smells all the time you know it by the
[1:04:31] time you're done with Father's Day you
[1:04:33] have a
[1:04:34] complex you know but uh uh but so you
[1:04:38] know that's how it is and you get socks
[1:04:41] and and things you know and it's really
[1:04:43] great and and all that and but uh the
[1:04:48] but you'd want them to have confidence
[1:04:51] that they they love you that you're
[1:04:53] there for them you know and you appr
[1:04:55] appreciate those things but it we this
[1:04:58] is so much deeper with God and and I
[1:05:01] honestly in my heart I really feel that
[1:05:05] God's Desiring his children to step up
[1:05:09] to rise in places that they've been
[1:05:13] maybe afraid to go amen and and this is
[1:05:16] the faith of Abraham
[1:05:19] Abraham's Faith was in the
[1:05:23] impossible he believed the Imp
[1:05:26] possible now that's the kind of faith
[1:05:29] that he wants us to have he wants us to
[1:05:32] have a faith that can believe the
[1:05:36] impossible and and the faith that that
[1:05:40] our Human Nature has if I could say it
[1:05:43] that way uh because I don't want to say
[1:05:45] you or me or or that but I I would say
[1:05:49] that the majority of people's Faith
[1:05:51] isn't a real genuine faith that
[1:05:55] something impossible Could Happen most
[1:05:58] of the time our faith stays within
[1:06:01] reason that's right you know within
[1:06:04] reason in other words something that we
[1:06:07] believe that uh it it's a goal that is
[1:06:11] seemingly
[1:06:12] reachable you know we can believe for it
[1:06:15] because we could understand how that it
[1:06:18] could come to pass or or or you know the
[1:06:21] we can see the
[1:06:23] possibilities of it a uh coming to pass
[1:06:26] so we could kind of look at it you know
[1:06:29] or maybe we could almost figure out how
[1:06:32] it could
[1:06:33] happen you know if if this happened and
[1:06:36] that happened and all these things
[1:06:38] happened and and the circumstances I I
[1:06:41] can believe that because I can
[1:06:43] comprehend
[1:06:45] it but the faith of Abraham was beyond
[1:06:49] comprehension it was beyond the
[1:06:51] comprehendable in fact it was in the
[1:06:54] impossible
[1:06:55] it didn't have anything to do with
[1:06:57] reasoning in fact it was unreasonable he
[1:07:00] was asked to believe something that was
[1:07:04] absolutely
[1:07:07] ludicrous you know you're kidding
[1:07:10] me no way yeah God told me oh no way God
[1:07:16] wouldn't tell you something like that
[1:07:18] that's
[1:07:20] craziness well he could have said well
[1:07:23] you know me and Sarah we talked to this
[1:07:27] uh herbal herbalist down there at the
[1:07:30] herb shop and he's got some Cactus mix
[1:07:33] that he put together and some hoba beans
[1:07:36] you know and uh uh why they got drinks
[1:07:40] today that's going to grow hair on my
[1:07:42] head it's going to straighten my skin
[1:07:44] out you know what I mean it's going to
[1:07:46] turn me into a young man again you know
[1:07:49] just for
[1:07:50] $49.95 you know three easy payments you
[1:07:54] know what I mean and and man I'm going
[1:07:56] to be young again you know what I mean
[1:07:58] why wait wait a minute I mean you going
[1:08:01] to believe in the Rapture you're going
[1:08:03] to believe in the change of the body oh
[1:08:05] that's nothing you don't need that you
[1:08:07] need a sports
[1:08:12] drink and they got them they got
[1:08:14] everything you
[1:08:16] got I heard one the other day it'll fix
[1:08:19] my heart it'll fix my my stomach it it
[1:08:23] it it it'll fix every about me and all
[1:08:27] you got to do is put this stuff in a
[1:08:29] glass of water and drink it now if you
[1:08:32] believe that I have something to sell
[1:08:35] you I mean you you know uh it just uh
[1:08:40] all this stuff well sure it's going to
[1:08:43] help I'm sure it helps you know what I
[1:08:45] mean if it helps to think that you're
[1:08:48] helping
[1:08:50] yourself you you know what I mean the
[1:08:52] psychology of it's great but Abraham
[1:08:55] wasn't asked to believe something that's
[1:08:57] within
[1:08:59] reach you know I always love those
[1:09:01] things they say take this with diet and
[1:09:06] exercise well I don't want something
[1:09:08] that requires diet and exercise I want
[1:09:11] something that I can eat and it's going
[1:09:13] to cause me to lose
[1:09:16] weight and I prefer it tastes
[1:09:21] good you know what I mean but they say
[1:09:23] oh take this with diet exercise you can
[1:09:27] lose well I can lose a diet with that
[1:09:29] that's my problem I I don't dieet and I
[1:09:32] don't
[1:09:35] exercise you know so it it that's that's
[1:09:38] not what where Abraham was at he wasn't
[1:09:42] looking for a way he could figure it out
[1:09:44] he wasn't looking for a gimmick he
[1:09:46] wasn't looking for some way it could
[1:09:49] happen he was looking for God to do it
[1:09:53] if it was going to be done it was going
[1:09:54] to be done by God that God was able to
[1:09:58] perform that which he promised that was
[1:10:01] the faith of Abraham it was a faith in
[1:10:03] the
[1:10:06] impossible
[1:10:08] impossible now God's trying to tell us
[1:10:11] I'm your father believe the
[1:10:17] impossible I'm here for you I'm with you
[1:10:20] I made you I put your faith within you
[1:10:23] faith is a gift of God the any man
[1:10:25] should boast I've given you
[1:10:28] Revelation but I don't want you to keep
[1:10:31] it in the Realms of
[1:10:35] Reason think of it not even in the
[1:10:39] Realms of
[1:10:41] reason he want you he wants your
[1:10:44] faith to to
[1:10:47] soar you know what what people think
[1:10:50] could never
[1:10:52] happen all things are possible with God
[1:10:57] is there anything too hard for the
[1:11:02] Lord I like Gaza he looked out there and
[1:11:05] he said oh
[1:11:08] master we're in big trouble the armies
[1:11:11] of the King has surrounded us and Elijah
[1:11:15] look at he says
[1:11:17] son don't
[1:11:19] worry there's more with us than there is
[1:11:23] with them open this boy's eyes that he
[1:11:26] can see you know wouldn't it be
[1:11:29] wonderful if we could start having our
[1:11:31] eyes open that our relationship with our
[1:11:36] father the love that our father has for
[1:11:39] us and the love that we have for him
[1:11:41] when we recognize who our father is he's
[1:11:44] the maker and creator of all Heaven and
[1:11:46] Earth he can do all things that through
[1:11:49] through him all things are possible
[1:11:52] through Christ Jesus who was God in
[1:11:54] flesh living among Stu to become
[1:11:57] tangible that we might be able to handle
[1:11:59] him touch him understand what he's
[1:12:01] capable of doing raise the dead turn
[1:12:04] fishes into a multitudes of baskets have
[1:12:09] done all these things before us that
[1:12:11] what that we might believe that all
[1:12:13] things are possible that's right not
[1:12:17] possible
[1:12:19] things but all impossible things are
[1:12:23] possible
[1:12:28] that we could we could start forging in
[1:12:31] faith and testifying in faith this can
[1:12:36] happen and when someone say
[1:12:38] how well I've only got one thing
[1:12:41] everything came by
[1:12:44] promise and he said so Abraham's only
[1:12:50] reasoning was God said
[1:12:53] so that's right that was all he had but
[1:12:57] that's all he
[1:12:58] needed that's all we need all we need as
[1:13:02] God said so God said by stripes are are
[1:13:05] healed I don't care what the sickness is
[1:13:08] it didn't say this heals this sickness
[1:13:11] and that sickness and this sickness it
[1:13:13] just said by stripes we are healed end
[1:13:16] the program I got stage five so what
[1:13:19] it's
[1:13:21] impossible Florence night Andale was
[1:13:24] impossible that's right amen there's a
[1:13:27] lot of them that were
[1:13:30] impossible Georgie
[1:13:33] Carter was
[1:13:36] impossible when Ronnie sheer first came
[1:13:38] to the message the first thing he did he
[1:13:40] got on the phone he called up and got a
[1:13:41] hold of Georgie
[1:13:43] Carter talk to
[1:13:45] her I don't know if she believes this
[1:13:48] message but she knows one thing she got
[1:13:51] prayed for and she got well
[1:13:57] because God deals in the
[1:14:00] impossible how can you set yourself
[1:14:04] apart if everything that you do is
[1:14:10] common I mean God uses medicine and we
[1:14:14] KN know he's the only
[1:14:17] healer but when man has gone all the
[1:14:20] farther he can go praise God he's the
[1:14:24] same yesterday today and forever so
[1:14:27] that's the kind of faith that Abraham
[1:14:30] had it was a a it was an impossible
[1:14:34] faith and God's wanting us to come to
[1:14:37] the place where we can start believing
[1:14:41] The Impossible yes I don't possibly see
[1:14:45] how this guy could ever get
[1:14:48] saved I don't possibly see it it it if I
[1:14:53] don't Poss just can't even see my
[1:14:57] parents getting converted I I I just
[1:14:59] can't even believe that my my teacher
[1:15:03] would even consider listening to the
[1:15:08] message why we've got more builtin
[1:15:14] unbelief then we've got
[1:15:20] belief we we we've we've got mental
[1:15:25] walls set
[1:15:26] up we've got situations that we we know
[1:15:31] the situations in which God can work but
[1:15:35] in other situations we don't know how he
[1:15:38] could work we don't need to know how he
[1:15:41] works we just need to know he does work
[1:15:44] Abraham never asked
[1:15:48] how he just said God is able
[1:15:55] and the impos he believed The Impossible
[1:15:57] and the impossible
[1:16:00] happened I remember the first time that
[1:16:04] I heard brother brandom explain how that
[1:16:09] Abraham and
[1:16:10] Sarah had that
[1:16:13] child and to me when I read it it was
[1:16:16] sitting right there in the scriptures
[1:16:19] all the time everybody should have came
[1:16:22] to that conclusion
[1:16:25] right Sarah and Abraham take off to
[1:16:28] another kingdom and this King Falls
[1:16:32] madly in love with a 90y old
[1:16:40] woman that that she was so
[1:16:44] fair that Abraham said you better lie
[1:16:48] and tell him you're my sister else he'll
[1:16:51] kill me and I just pictured it here
[1:16:56] [Music]
[1:16:59] SAR what did the king
[1:17:04] say no The Impossible
[1:17:09] happened the impossible is laying right
[1:17:12] there but what we need is we need isab
[1:17:15] that we can see we need isab we need to
[1:17:19] let the word of God become isabs to our
[1:17:21] eyes so we can sit back and we can
[1:17:23] believe the Imp possible that father
[1:17:26] this situation is beyond reason but I
[1:17:29] still believe you can do something
[1:17:34] fantastic because you're a God of the
[1:17:37] impossible that was the
[1:17:40] faith that
[1:17:43] Abraham had and that's the faith that
[1:17:47] Abraham
[1:17:48] fathered he didn't father religious
[1:17:51] faith faith in the doctrine faith in a
[1:17:57] teaching he he didn't he didn't even
[1:17:59] have a
[1:18:02] law so that wasn't the kind of faith
[1:18:05] faith today now is is our
[1:18:08] catechism we believe in in water baptism
[1:18:12] we believe in in these things and and
[1:18:15] all these things we'll do but let us
[1:18:17] move on to
[1:18:18] Perfection let us move to that place
[1:18:21] where we stand up as children and we
[1:18:24] believe my God can do all
[1:18:26] things and then I see a
[1:18:29] need I see that someone needs the
[1:18:32] impossible in their life they need the
[1:18:36] impossible yes you understand they
[1:18:39] they're in a they're in a situation that
[1:18:43] it it there's no hope for them outside
[1:18:47] of the hope of Faith or if I could say
[1:18:50] this the evidence of faith faith is the
[1:18:53] evidence of things hoped for
[1:18:55] not yet seen so you see the hope there
[1:18:58] you you you know there's hope they're
[1:19:00] hopeless but you know there's hope why
[1:19:02] do you know there's hope because you've
[1:19:04] got a
[1:19:06] father and you know he can do all things
[1:19:09] he can deliver from drugs he can deliver
[1:19:12] from alcohol he he can he can deliver
[1:19:15] finances he can change the situation he
[1:19:18] can bring someone to Christ he there's
[1:19:21] nothing that he can't do and he's got a
[1:19:23] people there that are believing in the
[1:19:30] impossible brother McGary that's
[1:19:32] impossible oh great yes I'm tired to
[1:19:37] believeing for things I can
[1:19:40] do we don't ask for faith we ask for
[1:19:45] strength we don't want to do the things
[1:19:47] that we can do because we're too
[1:19:50] lazy oh I shouldn't have said that
[1:19:53] scratch that
[1:19:57] but just think of the
[1:19:59] faith that abraam had and now that's the
[1:20:04] faith that Abraham fathered so all this
[1:20:07] other faith is religious
[1:20:11] Faith you know lighting a candle to a
[1:20:14] saint you know saying to Hell Mary and
[1:20:17] just think that somewhere along the line
[1:20:19] she'll
[1:20:20] intercede you know and then no matter
[1:20:23] what happens we attribute it wait a
[1:20:26] minute God works in the
[1:20:31] Supernatural you know you you you plant
[1:20:34] a seed you expect that seed to grow a
[1:20:37] tree because the power of transformation
[1:20:39] is that seed I don't plant a a seed and
[1:20:43] then have a plant come up and go praise
[1:20:45] God it's a
[1:20:47] miracle I had a miracle the other day I
[1:20:50] went to plant shed and I bought some
[1:20:52] seed and I planted them and they
[1:20:56] grew it's a
[1:21:00] miracle well
[1:21:04] yeah
[1:21:06] but that's
[1:21:08] fine anybody that plants the seed should
[1:21:10] have the miracle cu the miracle God put
[1:21:13] in the
[1:21:15] seed but now there's things that are
[1:21:17] totally impossible you looked at
[1:21:20] somebody I I believe if you really had
[1:21:22] met me before my conver iion you would
[1:21:25] say this is
[1:21:28] Lucifer and it's impossible for this guy
[1:21:31] to be
[1:21:33] saved he's blasphemed he's he's off of
[1:21:37] the book there there there's no way God
[1:21:40] wouldn't make a mistake of saving this
[1:21:43] fell but he
[1:21:46] did and I'm glad he
[1:21:49] did and was it impossible yeah
[1:21:55] and that's why I believe in my heart to
[1:21:57] this day that I don't believe there's a
[1:22:00] man that I can meet that God can't
[1:22:06] save I don't believe there's a dark
[1:22:09] place in my eyes yes sir that I won't
[1:22:13] try to tell them about the Lord or tell
[1:22:17] them that there's hope and their
[1:22:21] salvation there there's nobody that I
[1:22:23] want to to
[1:22:25] judge unworthy or judge my father
[1:22:30] unable and so many times we carry things
[1:22:34] and and we don't believe things and
[1:22:36] really what we're saying is God you're
[1:22:38] not able to take my guilt away you're
[1:22:41] not able to forgive the sins that I have
[1:22:44] you're not able to make right the wrongs
[1:22:47] that I've done and our lack of faith is
[1:22:50] really a lack in in God's ability
[1:22:55] and that's really what we're testifying
[1:22:56] to Abraham's whole testimony was that
[1:23:00] God was able yes God is able I don't
[1:23:04] care God's
[1:23:06] able he's able to do the blind eyes he's
[1:23:09] able to take cancer he's able to raise
[1:23:11] the Dead He's Able my God is able
[1:23:14] there's nothing he can't do all things
[1:23:17] are possible he wants a church he wants
[1:23:20] a family he wants Sons and Daughters to
[1:23:22] have impossible f
[1:23:27] that's what his desire is impossible
[1:23:32] faith
[1:23:34] not
[1:23:36] reason I thought of that saying I've
[1:23:38] heard it lately think outside the
[1:23:42] box I just thought you know that's
[1:23:45] always how Satan Works he knows where
[1:23:48] God's going and he put some sort of
[1:23:51] duplication out there somewhere some
[1:23:54] worldly parallel some catchphrase you
[1:23:58] know uh just do it you know think
[1:24:01] outside the about all those things are
[1:24:04] what God's trying to get his children to
[1:24:06] do Satan's actually using God's program
[1:24:09] perverting it to put his children in
[1:24:12] bondage where God's doing it to set his
[1:24:15] children
[1:24:16] free free from the world free from Every
[1:24:20] Chain the world can put on you free from
[1:24:23] every spirit the world can put on you
[1:24:26] free from every mental disease any
[1:24:29] physical disease anything this lousy
[1:24:31] world that we live in can put on you our
[1:24:34] God is able to rise us above
[1:24:39] it that's the faith that he wants his
[1:24:43] sons and daughters to have is the faith
[1:24:46] in the impossible the faith in the
[1:24:49] unreasonable the faith that can't be
[1:24:53] figured out a faith that has no program
[1:24:57] it just is
[1:24:59] still and knows that God said so God
[1:25:03] told me in his word by promise that it's
[1:25:08] possible and I that's all I got to
[1:25:10] believe I'm believing for the impossible
[1:25:14] and I just believe it's such a beautiful
[1:25:16] thing you could talk about all the
[1:25:19] people Warriors of Faith
[1:25:21] Moses defeated a whole civilization
[1:25:25] with a
[1:25:28] stick I like that story I like the story
[1:25:32] of
[1:25:33] Moses because he had to overcome a lot
[1:25:35] of
[1:25:37] obstacles I mean just from the beginning
[1:25:40] he might have walked in there pretty
[1:25:42] strong you know set my people free I
[1:25:45] just talked to God in the bush well that
[1:25:48] didn't Shake Pharaoh they had a God on
[1:25:52] every corner
[1:25:54] oh your God is in a burning bush good we
[1:25:56] got that we got a god of the sun we got
[1:25:58] a god of the Moon we got a god of the
[1:26:00] Stars we got a god of the river you know
[1:26:03] what's one more
[1:26:04] God Paul even went up there he says oh I
[1:26:07] seen you got a statue to the unknown god
[1:26:11] well that's just the God I
[1:26:13] know and he did The Impossible he
[1:26:15] converted men with the gospel and so
[1:26:19] Moses goes there I just love the story
[1:26:21] so much and he he goes down there and
[1:26:24] takes over a whole complete
[1:26:27] civilization I mean it's it's a way of
[1:26:30] thinking a way of magic a way of
[1:26:34] medicine a way of
[1:26:36] Science and when you really think what
[1:26:39] Moses did it would have been totally
[1:26:42] impossible for just somebody to show up
[1:26:45] on the
[1:26:46] scene who they all figured out was
[1:26:50] mad banished through the desert and came
[1:26:54] back a
[1:26:55] lunatic so much a lunatic that even his
[1:26:59] brothers and sisters rejected
[1:27:03] him throws the stick
[1:27:07] down Cheap Trick they throw their sticks
[1:27:11] down you know and he he goes and and
[1:27:14] when you read the story I I it's it's a
[1:27:17] wonderful Bible reading it's just a
[1:27:18] wonderful story but then he turns the
[1:27:21] river into
[1:27:23] blood and the Here Comes his guys ah
[1:27:25] just a cheap trick you know then he
[1:27:28] calls
[1:27:31] flies you know and and uh no after the
[1:27:36] the after the blood was
[1:27:38] frogs they had frogs in their cabinets
[1:27:42] don't you all love
[1:27:44] frogs frogs in your bed frogs in your
[1:27:47] pillow frogs in your shoes frogs in your
[1:27:51] soup frogs in your cupboard every where
[1:27:54] you look frogs frogs frogs
[1:27:59] frogs then after that they had
[1:28:02] flies and then after flies all their
[1:28:05] cattle died then I believe somewhere
[1:28:07] they had fleas and then they had
[1:28:10] boils and then after all the boils they
[1:28:13] had hail and after the hail they had
[1:28:16] Locust one thing after another their
[1:28:19] heart was hard their heart was
[1:28:22] hard it seemed
[1:28:27] impossible that they was ever going to
[1:28:30] be let
[1:28:31] go it seemed
[1:28:34] impossible just think of it you
[1:28:39] know I think that
[1:28:41] if that happened to me I think that I
[1:28:44] might say okay I get it go ahead no God
[1:28:49] hardened his heart that his power might
[1:28:53] be known
[1:28:55] seemingly
[1:28:56] impossible but Moses just kept standing
[1:29:00] there believing The
[1:29:03] Impossible and finally we know the story
[1:29:06] the death
[1:29:07] angel came through and really when you
[1:29:11] think about it if I could just say it in
[1:29:14] a little form of a
[1:29:16] type the death angel killed the
[1:29:21] unbelief and that's what we need the
[1:29:24] Promises of God to do is to kill the
[1:29:27] unbelief to kill the reasoning why why
[1:29:31] do we want to go beyond reasoning why do
[1:29:33] we want to go uh uh out of the Realms of
[1:29:38] reason because reason is what got us in
[1:29:42] the condition that we're
[1:29:47] in and you could just go on to the
[1:29:50] others David fighting Goliath and G
[1:29:54] Gideon taking 300 and and and Daniel
[1:29:58] facing lions and and and staying true to
[1:30:01] the word that Hebrews says by faith they
[1:30:04] subdued kingdoms you you know what I
[1:30:07] mean they did what was seemingly
[1:30:10] impossible and I believe that God with
[1:30:13] is trying to uh take us to the place
[1:30:17] that that will'll rise
[1:30:20] up that our hearts will become
[1:30:24] steadfast and that we'll look Beyond
[1:30:29] reasoning beyond the way that it could
[1:30:32] be done that we're not a offering God's
[1:30:36] programs God if you'll do this and
[1:30:39] you'll do
[1:30:41] that then I believe that I can do this
[1:30:46] and I can do that
[1:30:49] no I need a
[1:30:52] miracle Lord I need to do something I've
[1:30:55] been praying for years and years and
[1:30:58] years and i' I've I've done everything
[1:31:01] that I could and I'll continue to do all
[1:31:04] that I can do but I need the
[1:31:08] impossible I'm called to
[1:31:11] believe the
[1:31:14] impossible and I just trust that as Sons
[1:31:19] and Daughters of God you know that your
[1:31:23] father
[1:31:25] specializes in the
[1:31:28] impossible he
[1:31:31] specializes in the
[1:31:33] impossible I man a lady not too long ago
[1:31:37] sick
[1:31:39] and and you know probably one of the
[1:31:42] greatest sicknesses we have today is
[1:31:45] cancer and I just tried to tell her in
[1:31:48] the way that I could there is a voice
[1:31:52] today and
[1:31:55] this voice has a
[1:31:58] gift to impart
[1:32:01] Faith to a
[1:32:04] Believer now you have your own faith and
[1:32:08] I appreciate that but the faith that you
[1:32:12] have isn't strong enough to overcome
[1:32:15] this
[1:32:20] life but God sent a gift amen
[1:32:25] he he he sent one that can
[1:32:28] restore the faith of Abraham to The
[1:32:33] Impossible and I just said if you just
[1:32:36] sit down and
[1:32:38] listen I believe that there's something
[1:32:41] in you that that Faith voice will strike
[1:32:45] that Faith seed and that impossible
[1:32:48] faith will rise up within you
[1:32:54] but doesn't that seem for someone that
[1:32:57] reads the Bible and goes to church and
[1:33:00] and and is faithful in their religion
[1:33:03] doesn't it seem foolish that listening
[1:33:07] to a
[1:33:08] voice could impart
[1:33:11] faith that could heal
[1:33:17] you seems
[1:33:20] impossible but I know it's true
[1:33:25] I know it's true if you would just
[1:33:28] listen sit down
[1:33:31] listen this gift this prophetic gift has
[1:33:36] the ability to restore
[1:33:41] Faith impossible Faith the faith of
[1:33:46] Abraham they don't have to quote unquote
[1:33:48] believe the message The Way We believe
[1:33:50] the message and see it I'm telling you
[1:33:53] faith an anointing is on it it will
[1:33:58] work cuz God said
[1:34:00] so he said he would restore the
[1:34:06] faith I don't know if they can hear
[1:34:12] me you know I'm just a short bald
[1:34:17] preacher you know what I mean but I know
[1:34:19] it's
[1:34:20] life and life more abundant
[1:34:24] and I want to say to
[1:34:26] you this evening Sons and
[1:34:30] Daughters of
[1:34:32] God God sent you something to give you
[1:34:37] impossible
[1:34:40] Faith thank you
[1:34:42] Lord he he sent you a Ministry he sent
[1:34:46] you a voice he sent you a
[1:34:52] sign he said
[1:34:54] all that he could
[1:34:56] do the most
[1:34:59] fantastic Miracles and everything for
[1:35:01] one purpose that you would know that
[1:35:06] he's your
[1:35:07] father that all things are
[1:35:10] possible and that he
[1:35:13] specializes in the
[1:35:15] impossible I just pray that our whole
[1:35:17] body of Believers can rise up in the
[1:35:22] arms of
[1:35:24] Faith let's
[1:35:26] believe for the impossible not the
[1:35:30] reasonable but the impossible amen God
[1:35:34] bless you we've got a little bit of ice
[1:35:37] cream and there's nothing better after A
[1:35:40] good sermon than ice
