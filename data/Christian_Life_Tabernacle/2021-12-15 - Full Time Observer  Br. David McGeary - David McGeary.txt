tonight for this time of fellowship we're very thankful in jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you tonight if you have your bibles let's turn over to matthew the third chapter and we want to read a little portion and read some statements tonight on our just fellowshipping out of the message god's provided place of worship so mike and ellen are here with us let's do all that we can to keep them here and uh maybe we could rent them a little cottage they could spend some time over here with us but amen we're certainly glad to have him a lot of the reason that we're in the building we are in is because of brother mike and his diligence helping us get this building built so we're always eternally grateful for that if i was to title my message tonight i want to call it the full-time observer the full-time observer and uh i i thought that the story in matthew was a pretty good example of it i've been doing a little study on the life of john the baptist and one of the things that came to my uh remembrance or knowledge was that john had followers and these followers were scattered about everywhere but let's just read this little story here i think it's a great bible story and in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of god is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord making his path straight now this was a scripture being fulfilled right in their midst and it said and and it and the same john had his reignment of camel's hair and of leather and girded about his loins and his meat was locus and wild honey and then went out to him jerusalem and all of judea and all the regions round about jordan and another thing about john's ministry is they came to where he was he didn't go around he stayed in this one place preaching and baptizing and they came out from all the regions to him and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruit meant for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham our fathers for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and now also the axe is laid to the root of the tree therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewed down and cast into the fire i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire god bless you lord add his blessings to his word you may be seated i think that you see here two groups that showed up one group was full-time observers and the people that weren't observers were those that were baptized of john but those that came to observe the scripture simply said that they came to his baptisms so you can just picture the setting there they were sitting there they were listening to john preach john wasn't one that you might say was afraid to speak what the lord told them to speak he called it out just like it was he was in a politician his purpose was was to make straight the way or in other words to leave no doubt in which path that a person has to take and what he preached was repentance of sin and that was what his message was that there's one coming who is greater than i so repent of your sins you notice that the formula didn't change that even when it was said those who repent of their sins men and brethren what shall we do repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so it just showed that that john's gospel was in the will and the plan of god and along with it there was observers now an observer is a person who follows the events so the opposite of an observer is a participant many of us people who enjoy sports or enjoy things i have a great love for the symphony not that i can play an instrument or not that i know a a from a b or or anything but i i enjoy observing i i look out and i watch the string section you know and i i love it when the violins will go you know and and they're all moving their hands together you know and then you'll look over and they're playing the base and and you'll notice that four five seven eight groups of them all are kind of doing the same thing when their part comes and and so i i'm an observer and as an observer i participate in the music and in the spirit but i'm an observer and not a participant and so we found out there was a group of people that were observers and i i think it's a a wonderful but we don't want to be observers because that's not the place that we want to be in and if you go let's just turn in our scripture as we we uh to acts uh 19 and uh we just read this spot found here in in acts 19 uh and it it's a it's kind of a great uh place in the scripture because it it it's such a uh it it fortifies so much of john's ministry and the difference between the observer and the and the participant so you have to understand when they came out to see john there were those that heard his message and what did they do they repented and were baptized so they they were participating so the the very sign that they received the message was their participation in what john's message called for so the observer came out too have you heard what i've been preaching and you've come out to acknowledge it and to accept it will you two also be baptized uh in in in acknowledgement that what i'm saying is the truth but they were followers of the event so we want to draw a clear picture of the difference between an observer and a participator because we're talking about this provided place of worship and so those that went out to see john that weren't just observers they found the place of his message what his message was calling for they were convicted in their heart and their spirit the words that he spoke they they uh they they moved them you know they come under the influence of it and we're moved by it now without being moved by it without it having an effect on it the effect that it had on them is what made them participants you know they i i read an article i've read and studied a lot about the effects of the media and television and movies on the emotional effect that they have on uh society and there became a great time in this period of this country where uh the people that are attracted to what they call horror movies you know scary movies are usually uh teenagers and a tremendous effect on teenage girls between the ages of 13 and i think it's like 17 or 18 and uh and they make these movies and they go there and they enjoy this uh of fear and what happens is is they get sucked in and participating in the emotion and fear that's going on and it's all imaginary i mean you're sitting in a safe place you know what i mean there's there's no such thing as what's being presented the blob or the tingler or to any of those things you know what i mean the giant ant or the thing or or whatever there's none of you old enough in here to know the tingling or the blob but anyway but you you understand they they get they get caught up in it and they they participate in it and what it's prepping them for is to accept things based on emotion and not the not the ability to accept and and analyze the reality of what's transpiring and so it can then it make the articles go on and the study goes on to see what the acceptance is of violence and the acceptance of of the mistreatment of their fellow man because they've been conditioned by these emotions that normally you would be horrified to see some evil come upon somebody but now if someone falls or someone gets in an accident or somebody some misfortune befalls somebody their numbness to it has been there they've been numb to such things because they've seen such hideous things and they felt such hideous emotions that it's it's not as moving to them and therefore it affects in the long run their affection and their ability to love and their ability to be warm and and those things and you say well why do you say that because we just listened to it where the prophet of god said all these hideous things that they are seeing are going to visit them again and they're they're going to imagine these things actually happening so if we see this great difference between the participant so those that received john's message and participated in it they were baptized by john so let's read here in the in acts and 19 and we're going to find another group of participants okay and it came to pass that while apollos was in corinth paul having passed through the upper coast came to ephesus and finding certain disciples and he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said un to john's baptism so we find out here's people that were baptized by john and because they weren't observers but they were participants paul finds them in the upper coast of ephesus and finds that their disciples still following what john said and participating in what john said now because they weren't observers but they were they were participants we find that the spirit of god and the word of god finds them because they're involved in something they're participating in something they've received the message of john and the message was john was follow him that's to come after me because he's going to baptize you with fire so now paul comes along and says to him he says have you received the holy ghost he said we didn't know there were such things i would have liked to have been there for that teaching of paul to them as he told them about the that of i can just imagine him telling them their testimony how he got struck down on the road to the mathematician and how ananias came from him and prayed for him and he received his sight and he received the holy ghost and how the lord spoke to him so here they were participating in what john preached still and because they were participants and not observers i'm telling you a lot of people drop into the observation mode they quit being participants but these disciples remained participants and the promise of god found them and then paul they said paul said to them john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him what should come after him that is on jesus christ and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. so i don't know how many sisters were there and children were there but there was 12 good strong men to start the church of ephesus with so we're talking about this place this provided place of worship and we want to talk about this place because we want to approach this place from either the standpoint of an observer or a participant all right now i don't want to be a full-time observer you know what i mean i want to be a i want to be led if i could say uh or another word might be as as john preached his message every repentance i want to be convicted into action i want to be convicted in from moving from an observer to a participant we come as observers but i don't want to remain a full-time observer i want something to prick my heart i want something to give me isab that i might see i want to have something happen to me that's going to cry out in my spirit excuse me what must i do or let's put it this way what can i do lord i want to participate what works would you have me to do what what prayers would you have me say what burdens would you want me to take upon my heart so an observer he can talk about something some of the greatest sports people have never played the game what do they call them commentators they have their opinion about this and their opinion about that we have a lot of political commentators and observers who have never run for office they've never participated but they've got a mountain of words at a mountain of observation and they can become almost a a a professional or someone that has i'm looking for the word uh for in my vocabulary but someone who's an expert on something that they've never done have you ever watched a cooking show well it's like walking watching cooking shows and you know when they you mix the butter and you do this and you preheat the oven and you chop this up and you just take a pinch of this and you know bam and all this stuff and are you all watching the cooking shows but you've never cooked it in your life you can talk about it you've become an expert on cooking you know so we've got and we've got to understand that in order to enter into this god's provided place you can only enter in as a participant not of an observer that's what the lady will see as churches behold i stand at the door and knock and that would be like someone sitting there there's somebody knocking at the door jesus is knocking at the door and they can tell you all about what jesus is but they never open the door that he can come in and sup with them and make them a participant in what he's doing so if if we find this place if if it is a place then it can be found so if god has provided a place of worship so he's provided a place and it's the only place that he'll receive worship now he's not going to receive worship from an observer the worship comes by the participation if you love me keep my commandments so remember the observer he knows it's there but he's an observer of it but he's never brought himself into the act of participation and so you can have fellowship in observation we we can all have fellowship observing the message that has come you understand the message has come it's not going to be added to and it's not going to be taken from it'll be disbelieved and most people that disbelieve it are because they observed and they were observers and the more they observed the more they looked and the more it was easy to find fault but if they were participating and they were participating in what that it spoke of the people that were baptized by john for the remission of their sins they had something that could never be taken from them because they didn't stand on the bank telling everything that john did telling stories about the people that came down to the water but never coming into the water themselves so you can be a full-time observer and be in fellowship right but you've got to examine your own self by way of participation and uh so if it's a place it can be found and there's it'll have landmarks john's was baptizing in the wilderness on the river jordan it was a place that could be found it had landmarks and so it has landmarks or in other words it has identifying characteristics wherever two or three are gathered in my name there i will be so there's landmarks there's there's grace it'll have identifiable activity so there's certain things that are going to go on in this place so that you know it's the place so it can be found now we've already know that the place is jesus christ but it's not jesus christ 2000 years ago there's a monument to george washington but george washington isn't there now we can have a monument to jesus but jesus isn't there and we know he's not there because he's risen from the dead so if he was the place of worship he didn't stay still you understand he moved through the church ages and people could find him in every age he was able to be found but men were observers and being observers they built monuments to what they observed but they remained observers and they built their monuments and their doctrines and their creeds based upon their observation but if they would have been participants they would have had a complete different viewpoint i mean the person that standing in the batter's box and having that pitcher throw the ball at him at 105 miles an hour has a whole lot of different perspective of the person sitting in the stands i've sat in the stands and heard that ball whistle and 90 feet isn't very far at all it's like close and i don't know who can do the math but 105 miles an hour 90 feet goes by in about two seconds and it's a great observer but when that great big uh linebacker smacks into that guy and slams him onto the ground oh the participant has a different viewpoint than the observer he knows what's transpiring in the experience so he understands the place he understands the activity he knows what the landmarks are you know one of the landmark for a believer right is the fiery darts of the enemy amen you know you're in that place when the devil's shooting arrows at you you know you're in that place when all men don't speak well of you you know you you you know you're in that place you know here in that place when you need character gold tried in fire so there's there's landmarks with that place but there's also activity in that place so let's turn to saint john the 14th chapter and and uh the 12th verse we just want to talk now just a little bit about the activity in the place so if you find the place there's going to be an activity that participates in that place every game has rules i liked as a kid in my family we would play basketball or play a game but as we go along the rules would change we would add a rule or we'd take a rule away or we'd interpret it and something like that we used to play pick up basketball at in pickup basketball you could call a foul so if a guy missed a shot he would claim foul and he'd get the ball so that guy called foul to her three times me wait me nick we made up a brand new rule only two fouls you can only call two thousand you make up rules as you go and but this identified place you understand doesn't have changing rules because it's a provided place so the participant is moved upon and enters into the commandments of that place so let's just read as we're just doing this little bible study tonight saint john 14 i always loved the first verse let not your hearts be troubled if you believe in god believe also in me and then he goes over here in the 12th verse it says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and even greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father now so now we know now that there is a description of the participant what if the people that believed john's message what did they do they were baptized they entered in to the activity that was described by john receiving john's message so now jesus says if you believe on me i am going to describe to you the activity that follows your belief that's ready that's what he said the works that i do you shall do alls if you believe on me if you hear my message if you hear what i'm saying if you receive the baptism in which i baptize you shall do these works also and greater works than shall you do more because i go to my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father me may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it another description of a participant now the scripture said as the disciples went out and teaching in and paul and james and them they they had something they said they said you have not because you ask not right in other words you are not participating you're observing but you're not participating so personally there's fellowship in observation but if you're a participant you're going to ask and he will do if you're a participant there are works and greater works that follow you so there's got to there's a line that allows us to understand if we found that place because he said in that place there will be people that are asking and receiving so i know i found the place when i come to a place wherever two or three are there are gathered and he is in their midst and they're asking him and receiving we don't need to observe the history of the lord jesus and observe the history of this message we need to be participants in its identifying activity and its landmarks and so we we go on to read as he said if ye love me keep my commandments so there's rules and i don't want to call them laws but there there is uh there's guidelines and there's there's uh things that the believer does that allows him to stay in that place so i would say this that a place has boundaries that's what makes a country a country is its borders well the borders of the place is its commandments that's its border lines when you cross those commandments you've stepped out of the activity and out of the place that things happen though this place has boundaries it's not a freelance thing it's not something that can be adjusted and moved and and then it's a set dimension it's a place it's got boundaries and the boundaries are the commandments and the spirit that runs this place and the spirit that exists in this place is love that's a capstone of this place is the love of god shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit it's done by love and he said if you love me you keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so this beautiful place that we found to be the lord jesus is not a place that can't be found it's not a place that doesn't have borders it's a real place it's a real existence and it has identifying characteristics and landmarks that tell it's a place peace that's her bath is understanding joy unspeakable rest come unto me all year heavily laden i'll give rest it's got landmark identifications and it's got it's got identifiable activities they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall cast out devils they shall comfort one another they'll visit the widow and the fatherless in their reflection of the afflictions there's so many identifying activities that separate the observer from the participant very now let's just read in closing a few statements out of god's provided place of worship and we'll start over if the brothers want to put it up at paragraph 106 and we're just going to read a few uh um statements that allow us to understand that there is a provided place for every age in luther's age there was a provided place of justification i've been to the walls of the reformer and i've been over to the church and and i saw those great man there that were preaching reformation but coming out of the catholic church the justification by calvary and the grace of god and the no longer the need to buy penance that was a great stand that those men took and their gospel still stands today the thing was is that the lord moved on so when they don't move with the lord they set up camp on their observations and now they stick to what they've observed it's like an observatory the lutheran church is an observatory to the reformers but the lord's moved on because there's activity going on with the participant and there's boundaries and there's landmarks i hope that my words are capable of expressing that paragraph 106. now we find out that when we start with christ we grow the same way because we grow in grace and in admonition of god so what is one of the characteristics is growth so if you're not growing you've done what you've reached the top of your potential i am not going to grow any higher i may grow out but i'm not going to grow up well i don't want to be that as a christian i want higher ground don't you so it says here so god's only provided plan for any age is his word amen so for any age it's his word that's the provided plan for every age but it's like in every age how come luther didn't see the baptism of the holy ghost it's hard to believe because he was led just that far so every ages is his word his son came and manifested every promise that was promised for his age all the prophets came in just exactly on time they was god's word living on earth they was the word jesus said that they were gods jesus called the prophet's gods and so let's just turn or you won't have to turn go to paragraph 110. it says we find that in each age when god said a a certain thing would happen here comes that man along that manifest that here come their people along and live that so every age that god every time god moves there's somebody that's going to manifest that place that the people can live it because the people that are in that place are active they're not observers many people looked at this message they believed brother branham was a prophet and they they speak of their observation of his ministry but that's one thing totally different than those that received what he was saying because what he was saying was there was going to be a people that received that spirit and we're going to do the same works that he did with the same motive the same objective and the same love not of manifest power but to manifest compassion and sympathy and defiance of the devil claiming those that are in the bondage to the enemy claiming them and fighting a battle for them to bring them into the presence of a savior and a delivering god he said manifest that and here come their people along and live that that was god himself living in the people because it was an answer of his word you can talk about the messenger you can talk about all that he did all the works he did all the vindication he had but that was not his message his message was the same god that you saw on display is the same god that can live in you and if he lives in you the love of god will be shed abroad in your heart by the holy spirit and you will be motivated to do the works by the motivation and compassion that he did the works by therefore it becomes a manifestation of him not a proof of your observation but a life of participation you've heard the message and you're participating in it because you understood what the message was john's believers understood what john was saying the messiah is coming get your life right so that you can receive them when he comes that was his message those that heard it gladly went into the water and did the works those that really and gladly received this message i want to be participators and bring the life of christ and bring the word of god and bring the promises of god's word to those that are needy of receiving them it's fine if we do it in here that's patting one another on the back but when you get an opportunity and someone calls you to be to pray for somebody it's going into that hospital and being able to tell that person that might be facing the last days of their life and be able to tell them about a god that can forgive them of their sins and if they have faith can raise them up i'm afraid our churches are becoming full-time observers observing the history of william branham instead of accepting the spiritual life that he put on betray put on display that every believer would have jesus said the works that i do you shall do also but you've got remember the tape we just listened to he said god gave the land but you had to do the house cleaning he said there's the land the observer went into the land and said that's too big of a devil to cast out if i go lay my hands on the sick and that person don't get well everybody's going to mock me the fear of failure so they sat back they went in there and they said it's the land that he said it was full of milk and honey it's got all the landmarks but man there's a lot of big things to overcome they were observers they testified to the land it was exactly the land that was described but there was two participants amen they said we i can do this i can do this i'm gonna participate i'm going to testify i'm going to talk about it i'm going to tell them about saving grace i'm going to tell them about he's a healer i'm going to ask them if they've received the holy ghost since they believed because they now are participants of the message because they heard the message and if they heard it in our participants then they're going to do what the message said if they're observers they're going to come out with their own ideas that's why we have 900 different denominations the church of jesus christ has never changed since the day of pentecost we were in paragraph he says now god only provide now god's only provided and only plan today is his son through his word for this age quickened by the spirit of his life quickened so the plan of this place is the spirit of god quickening the word that was spoken a quickening life that quickens what quick and mean made alive in other words when you're in this place there's a spirit the spirit of god that quickens what you've heard and makes it live in you we don't want to be observers i'm telling you not everybody's a preacher i understand that but but you know when that life comes on you whether it's a schoolmate whether it's a work companion whether it's a friend with whether it's someone you come in contact with you know that there's a quickening spirit in you that wants to make that message that's living in you alive to them now you know you're in that place because there's something that's moving in you quickening you now we have great schools of theology and many times nothing against it certainly not but you see when you got a school of theology jesus said in saint john 4 the time has come and now is when god being a spirit will be worshiped in spirit and in truth now some people have spirit but no truth others truth but no spirit spirit and truth you know there's a lot of things that come up that you wore against i had them the baptist minister down the street he just took over he took over his the church down the street and and i went down there to see him and because i i knew that if the lord allows us to build our building we'll need parking and he said we could use his parking lot and and that's a great blessing and in the meantime he thought well you know maybe we could do something and he wanted to know if he could use my baptistry and i thought about that and i thought about it and i thought do i want him to use our baptistery him and we don't baptize the way they do we don't believe that's way and then i thought well you know he wants to do something there's some people that that want to be baptized and it's not their fault and i just prayed about it and i thought it through and so i finally told them i said you know brother young i said you know we have a moral standard at our church you know and a dress code and uh and we you know our our church we we don't wear pants and i said now if a visitor comes and they come in we're happy to let them in and hear the gospel i said but this is past that and he said okay i understand that he says what about me i said well you know i i wear slacks in a shirt when i baptized he said i can do that but he said i'll go get a robe i'll borrow some baptismal clothes from the and i told them how we did it and i thought you know i could take the stance no we don't baptize in this way but you know there's someone that wants to be baptized and i waited out and i thought my heart i thought you know that's a good thing you know and and and uh it's not i thought well is it this sunday says it's no it's down the road and i thought well you know i've made my the waters open he wants to come baptized it's not going to hurt us we know that's not right but it might give him an opportunity for me to explain to him the right way to baptize the biblical way to baptize but i'd rather that that man or that woman and that child that wants to get baptized is wanting to turn their life around and if they're getting a genuine turnaround in life where do you think the spirit of god's going to lead them it's going to lead them to god's provided place of worship if you can tell somebody this gospel from a participating standpoint and not an observa observation standpoint you'll be effective but if you're just talking if you're just observing brother branham did this and brother branham did that and brother branham did this and brother and you can't tell them what the prophet described the place of worship being and the spirit that's there and the activity that's there and the testimony that's there and the peace that's there and the joy that's there if you can't share it from a participation painting standpoint then you're really not telling them anything you're telling them what they've all ready got too many people's gospel has just been observation and when they examined themselves they weren't participants so they thought their observation was wrong you can't live on observation let's not be full-time observation now let's let's just finish up right now paragraph 117 no matter how well you've taught how well you'll believe and how much of the bible that we say is truth and we believe it all true it's got to be a dynamic has got to be there the spark to set the word of fire and make it start rolling that's the activity the mechanics is the observation the dynamics is the participation it's got to have that if you don't the church sits still the car sits still you'll sit still but no matter how much you say i sympathize i believe every word of that you've got to have something to spark that off to make that 100 octane go to firing and that big church of god got to move on it's got to take the dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics but it lacks the dynamics it lacks the participation and i couldn't say this i think if it's a problem i think that we could find in every church we've got observers and not participators it's not for me to call them out but we got those who are doing and carrying on and producing the power of god and we've got those that believe it i believe every bit of that but they've never been sparked into action to make the gospel roll and when it rolls it moves towards the unbeliever it really does the spirit of god will lead you into all the world to preach the gospel and then we'll close with this paragraph paragraph 1 26 then notice not only does he come in by the spirit with the learning of his word malachi 4 5. revelations 10 7 malachi 4 5 the seven seals the evidence a whole list this place also produces the learning of his word he manifests that word now remember the prophets believed the word they received the word of god and god the holy spirit came into them and fired that promise out and made it come to pass oh my who's going to condemn that in that paragraph we just read this last two little statements i hope it makes it clear it says it says why the dynamics was there to fire off the mechanics he was the mechanics the son himself and the father was the dynamics it's not me that does the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he's splattered forth the dynamics and makes the thing move on and bring it to pass paragraph 137 no notice when the great moving power of god comes into a son of god it quickens him the spirit of life enters into him then what does it do it sets them in heavenly places right now not they will we are now we've already resurrected the dynamics and the mechanics is gone to work quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of god where his spirit is and now we are seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus in christ jesus sitting in there the great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead or a part of it if you're a part of the bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know so we find out that it's the same thing and she'll do exactly what it's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a lady osea not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for god shall be moving on in the spirit of god amen the participator versus the full-time observer amen i think it's a challenge that each of us need to sit back in your life and move from what do i believe to what do i do amen god richly bless you let's stand together this evening just god's place of worship we know it because of the activity that's there and the activity of the believer so if you find a place that that's not happening you're not in the place a good start is to really know what we're looking for what is it that we're doing do we know what we're doing we're not here to give testimony to the prophet alone but we're here to give testimony to what he said the church would be let's pray our heavenly father i i hope tonight these words are encouragement because father that's a promise and we grow into the promise and faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god and may each person that heard it not judge themselves outside but father may the judgment of their heart be i want in a command may it be like the little eagle in the barnyard not looking around and saying oh i'm here but the cry of their heart oh i want to go there father may i cry of our heart is i want to be a participant i want to move from the stands onto the field i want to move from the pew out into life's action i want to work move from inward faith to outward spoken faith i want my light to shine i want to remove the basket father that i've kept my life under and i want to set it on a hill that my good works might glorify my father in heaven that whatever place i am in life whatever pathway you talk take me down whatever people you bring me in contact with that i'm participating in the living manifested gospel that was preached to this stage the restoration of the faith that our fathers had when they went out across the land telling people of a risen savior father the great enemy has put observation towers on every corner [Music] and yet you're walking right in our midst may each of us find you in our
