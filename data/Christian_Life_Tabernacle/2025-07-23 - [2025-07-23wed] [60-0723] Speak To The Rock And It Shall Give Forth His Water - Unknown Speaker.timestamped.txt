[28:45] [Music]
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he worthy of all praise and
[28:59] honor?
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We lift up praises. and he
[29:03] promised he who would inhabit the
[29:05] praises of his people. So we know that
[29:07] he's here and let's just bow our heads
[29:09] together as we approach him. Heavenly
[29:12] Father, Lord, we thank you for the time
[29:15] that you've granted us tonight, Lord, to
[29:18] fellowship around your word. Lord, we
[29:21] know that these days are coming to a
[29:24] close. And there's going to be a time,
[29:26] Lord, where we can't gather like this,
[29:28] Lord. And so while we have the
[29:30] opportunity, Lord, we want to grab it,
[29:33] Lord. We want to, Lord, seize the moment
[29:35] and realize, Lord, that you have
[29:37] something special for us. We pray that
[29:40] we could lay aside everything from the
[29:42] day or the week or the month or this
[29:44] year that's maybe tried to hinder us
[29:46] from serving you with all our heart. And
[29:49] Lord, may this be a special time, Lord,
[29:51] with the believers, Lord, that they can
[29:53] hear from heaven, Lord, that the word of
[29:56] God can echo back in a that theophony,
[30:00] Lord, the heart of the believer, Father,
[30:02] as we commit this time of fellowship, we
[30:04] invite you, Lord, break the bread of
[30:06] life, Lord, that we can leave here
[30:08] different, Lord. That we can leave here
[30:10] closer to you and more like you and more
[30:13] fit for your service. Lord, we just want
[30:16] to yield ourselves recognizing our
[30:18] inability. But Father, we know that if
[30:20] we just surrender ourselves, Lord, that
[30:22] your spirit can take control of every
[30:25] heart here. Lord, we committed to you.
[30:27] We pray your blessings upon your people
[30:29] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Well, we're greet you in the name of the
[30:35] Lord Jesus and uh we're happy to be
[30:37] home. We we wanted to bring some
[30:39] greetings from uh our trip in Romania,
[30:42] Brother Cosman and uh the brothers
[30:44] there. We had a few services. Uh we had
[30:46] five services. There was uh four
[30:48] ministers that were able to take five
[30:50] services. We were part of a couple of
[30:52] them. And so, but we do bring the the
[30:54] love and greetings from um the uh
[30:57] Nazareth Tabernacle and uh brother
[31:00] Cosman, he sends his loves and greeting.
[31:02] The family there is doing well. We did
[31:04] suffer a little bit of light affliction
[31:06] while we were there. We had some
[31:07] sickness and things but but you know we
[31:09] can we can bring back and tell you that
[31:12] if if you preach the gospel in its
[31:13] purity and unadulterated brings forth
[31:15] the results of sons and daughters you
[31:18] know in divine fellowship. So, we're
[31:20] here to report to you that uh all is
[31:22] well and uh the the to see the hand of
[31:25] God using our brother to, you know, tie
[31:28] up where maybe fellowships had been
[31:31] broken and even testimonies of other
[31:34] pastors telling us how God has used our
[31:36] brother. And so, we just want to
[31:38] continue to remember them and uh in
[31:40] prayer and just uh we're so glad that we
[31:43] were able to have the opportunity and
[31:45] thank you for your prayers and support.
[31:46] So Lord bless you and we'll just uh just
[31:49] maybe uh share a little thought. We'll
[31:51] just go right to the word of God. I'm
[31:53] just trusting the Lord will lead here.
[31:55] Uh but I was listening to a message
[31:56] called Speak to the Rock today and uh I
[32:00] just I couldn't get away from it. I
[32:01] listened to it three four times and so
[32:04] uh we just trust that somehow it'll fall
[32:06] in line with what has been ministered
[32:08] here recently. I certainly enjoyed the
[32:10] the service about um you know lean not
[32:14] unto your own understanding. But we'll
[32:16] just read that scripture again. Proverbs
[32:18] chapter 3 just as we open and draw a
[32:21] little inspiration and maybe speak to
[32:23] you for a few minutes. But in uh
[32:26] Proverbs chapter 3
[32:37] says this in verse one. My son, forget
[32:39] not my law, but let thine heart keep my
[32:43] commandments.
[32:45] For length of days, and long life and
[32:47] peace
[32:49] shall they add to thee. Let not mercy
[32:52] and truth forsake thee. Bind them about
[32:55] thy neck, and write them on the tables
[32:58] of thine heart. So shall thou find favor
[33:02] and good understanding in the sight of
[33:04] God and man. Trust in the Lord with all
[33:08] thine heart and lean not unto thine own
[33:10] understanding and in all thy ways
[33:13] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[33:16] paths. You may have your seeds. We trust
[33:19] the Lord will add a blessing to the
[33:20] reading of his word. You know, we just
[33:22] um we realize that if um we would just
[33:27] trust in the Lord and acknowledge him.
[33:29] You know, I think it's very important in
[33:31] this hour that not only are we
[33:34] professors of the message, we proclaim
[33:36] it, we believe it, but it's there comes
[33:40] a time where it's time to take
[33:41] possession of what God's given us. You
[33:44] know, the the gift of God is eternal
[33:47] life. And God, he he he purchased it for
[33:50] us, right? We had an inheritance. It was
[33:52] incorruptible, but it was bound up
[33:54] because of sin. But God, he came and
[33:57] manifested himself. The the the written
[34:00] word became the spoken word and then it
[34:02] became manifested in this hour to loose
[34:04] us of our unbelief. Amen. And so we see
[34:08] that if we can just acknowledge him and
[34:11] I thought that was a uh kind of a a key
[34:14] point. So the word acknowledge is is to
[34:17] accept or admit the existence of or a
[34:21] truth
[34:23] a truth of something. And and as brother
[34:26] David had read the quote about um in
[34:30] lean not into your own understanding how
[34:32] that the written word had no longer
[34:34] began uh was regarded as a resource of
[34:39] understanding you know and that's that's
[34:42] an interesting thing that even the the
[34:44] the spoken word has not even begun to be
[34:48] regarded. And I thought it was so
[34:50] special how the Lord led our pastor to
[34:52] to be inspired and line it up like we
[34:55] have a life coach and we want to be able
[34:57] to have the mindset to understand that
[35:00] God wants to speak to us every day,
[35:03] every moment of the day. And and and we
[35:06] we're not left without a guide. God's
[35:08] provided a way in this hour. And and
[35:12] that's through the message. And and God
[35:14] wants it to be such an individual
[35:16] affair. We don't want to pass the buck
[35:18] off to somebody else. But it's so
[35:20] personal that each one of us take our
[35:22] position. Amen. That's so important. If
[35:25] the body's going to work in harmony and
[35:27] unison, we all have the same headship.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; You know, we're we're under the
[35:33] tutorship of the Holy Ghost. Amen. And
[35:36] and and your part is very critical. And
[35:39] and if we're not faithful to go feed,
[35:42] then we'll be lagging as a body. So we
[35:45] we have an individual responsibility.
[35:48] Amen. So we don't want to just profess
[35:50] we believe the message, but we want to
[35:52] go into the storehouse and possess it.
[35:54] We want it to the challenges that we
[35:57] face in in the the struggles in life. We
[36:00] want it to to minister to us in a in a
[36:03] daily way, in a daily bread. As the
[36:06] struggle comes on, we want to be able to
[36:08] possess it and speak it and say, "This
[36:11] is mine. This is something that God gave
[36:14] me.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; It's personal to me.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, the struggle is real. People are
[36:20] going through sickness and oppression.
[36:23] There people without jobs. People need
[36:25] to sell their house. They have family.
[36:27] But but we're a people that God has
[36:29] given a promise. And we can not only
[36:31] profess the promise, but we can claim it
[36:34] as our own. God, you promised me. I'm
[36:37] going to possess the land that you gave
[36:39] me. I'm excited about it. You love me so
[36:43] much that you gave me this promise and
[36:46] now I can boldly go and walk into my
[36:49] inheritance
[36:50] &gt;&gt; because he he paid the price.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; It's there for the taking.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; We want to go and possess it.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Well, we also want to trust in the Lord
[37:01] and acknowledge this is we want to
[37:04] acknowledge this has the power of
[37:06] transformation.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing. The seed and
[37:10] the potentials of God are laying within
[37:12] you. God has entrusted us to go and feed
[37:15] that seed, the word of God. The Holy
[37:18] Spirit does not feed on our fellowship.
[37:20] The Holy Spirit feeds on the word of
[37:22] God.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; So, we have a responsibility each and
[37:27] every one of us.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:32] Well,
[37:35] you know, I just uh
[37:38] I'm going to say that um tonight we're
[37:41] just going to talk a little bit about
[37:42] this message. Speak to the rock and
[37:45] it'll bring forth his waters. You know,
[37:48] this message is so profound to me and I
[37:51] believe that we don't want to get to the
[37:54] place where we're leaning on our own
[37:55] understanding,
[37:57] &gt;&gt; right? We want revelation to be the
[37:59] thing that leads us that that we lean
[38:02] on, right? Understanding from the carnal
[38:05] side, it can fail. But when it's
[38:08] revelation and it's understanding from
[38:10] God, that's you can trust that. Trust in
[38:14] the Lord and lean not to your own
[38:17] understanding. Amen. So,
[38:21] you know, we just probably going to take
[38:22] a moment and listen to a message and I
[38:25] want you to make note of the certain
[38:27] promises. You know, it's so amazing how
[38:30] the carnal mind is at immity with the
[38:32] spirit of God. But you can see through
[38:34] the Old Testament and different
[38:36] interactions that Brother Brandham's
[38:38] going to talk about. We're going to play
[38:39] a portion of tape. But listen, how it
[38:42] seemed like a setup, you know, when
[38:44] Moses and the children of Israel looked
[38:46] like they were going into a death trap,
[38:48] right? And so what what I want us to
[38:51] start recognizing is uh and I know many
[38:54] of you do. I'm just saying this for me,
[38:56] I I was so blessed thinking about how so
[38:59] many times I lean towards the carnal
[39:01] side, but I believe that God wants us to
[39:03] look beyond what we can see with our
[39:06] natural eye and take this faith
[39:09] &gt;&gt; by the word of promise and overcome.
[39:12] Amen. So, so I believe that um you know
[39:17] as we we we listen to this message,
[39:19] maybe you can take note of some of the
[39:21] promises, you know, where it seemed like
[39:24] the the believer was uh set up for a
[39:27] trap, but listen how that they were able
[39:30] to possess and go to the rock and speak
[39:34] to the rock and watch it have a
[39:36] relationship with this rock, Christ
[39:39] Jesus. And that's what revelation does.
[39:41] It brings us into relationship with God.
[39:44] Amen. So maybe I'll say this. You we
[39:47] want to I I'm a professor, but I want to
[39:52] be a possessor. Amen. So we want to
[39:55] transition. Not only are we constantly
[39:57] believing and speaking, I'm a believer
[39:59] and I'm this and that. But one of these
[40:01] days, you know, when it just becomes I'm
[40:04] so desperate, I can't have anything
[40:06] else. I got to have God
[40:09] &gt;&gt; manifested in my life. Yes sir.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; But uh this message speak to the rocket
[40:13] in in paragraph 65. This is about
[40:15] halfway. It says if God made a promise,
[40:18] God gave the promise.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; You believe it. I don't care what it
[40:24] takes. It's yours.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Fight the devil on every ounce of ground
[40:29] he stands on. Walk over and take it.
[40:32] Take the sword of the word.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; God's promise is true. Nothing can stop
[40:38] them. They're God's promises. He gave us
[40:42] the promise of that just like he did the
[40:45] children of Israel, the Pentecostal
[40:48] church that has come to this Kadesh
[40:50] Barnea, their Kadesh Barnea. Are we
[40:53] able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ is the
[40:57] same yesterday, today, and forever. Can
[40:59] we walk up there and take a hold of the
[41:02] pro God's promise and say, "It's true. I
[41:05] claim it. It's mine.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; I own it. God gave it to me.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. We want to
[41:13] take possession of our promise.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; We want to go to the enemy and say,
[41:17] "This is my ground."
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Your loved ones,
[41:21] &gt;&gt; you know, God God promised to protect
[41:25] us, to make provision. He's promised a
[41:27] way of escape in the temptations,
[41:29] whatever you're going through.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; I like it. in 84 or in ' 87 he says like
[41:37] old Buddy Robertson's testimony he says
[41:39] Lord give me a backbone the size of a
[41:42] saw log and plenty of knowledge in the
[41:45] gable end of my soul and let me fight
[41:49] the devil as long as I got one tooth
[41:51] left and then gum him till I die
[41:55] what we need is courage we not a
[41:58] wishbone but a backbone a real
[42:00] spiritfilled heart filled with the Holy
[42:03] Ghost sanctified by the blood of Jesus
[42:06] Christ, living a life,
[42:09] &gt;&gt; walking in the path of God, keeping his
[42:12] commandments, claiming every promise of
[42:15] God as our own property.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Even the young people, the old people,
[42:20] girls, boys, if you're a believer, you
[42:23] can claim your promise.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; It's your property.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock and watch it bring
[42:29] forth its waters.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. 101. It says God called Moses and
[42:34] Aaron into the presence and came down in
[42:38] the shikina glory and blessed them. God
[42:41] told the prophet, he said, "Speak the
[42:44] speak to the rock." Amen. In the midst
[42:46] of their sin. You know, I want you to
[42:49] listen to this and it don't matter what
[42:51] sin is hindering you. Speak to the rock
[42:56] &gt;&gt; and watch God bring forth his promise.
[42:59] brothers, if you can play this portion
[43:02] of tape and then right after we'll
[43:05] probably just turn it right over to
[43:06] brother Billy. Lord bless you. I know
[43:08] this is a long tape. It's 45 minutes or
[43:12] so, but I want you to glean. This is the
[43:14] hour that we want to take possession.
[43:17] And I don't think I I just felt in my
[43:20] heart it would be better for you to
[43:22] receive it direct. this specific thing.
[43:25] I I I just really feel like it it aligns
[43:28] with the way that our carnal mind brings
[43:30] our own understanding. But the things
[43:32] that we're going through in life, God
[43:34] has for ordained that the faith of God
[43:37] can move in you and you'll overcome.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Brothers,
[43:43] please uh I believe the tape begins in
[43:47] 32 and then it'll go right to paragraph
[43:50] uh 158. God bless you as we listen to
[43:54] brother Brandham if if we've already
[43:56] stood for the scripture, but he's going
[43:58] to read out of Numbers 20 and so I'm
[44:01] sure it'll be a blessing to you and uh
[44:04] maybe we can compare notes afterwards.
[44:06] God bless you.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Now,
[44:11] you love him with all your heart.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just fine. My I feel real
[44:17] religious to start with tonight.
[44:22] We want to read out of the book of
[44:24] numbers. You are keeping down.
[44:29] Then came the children of Israel, even
[44:31] the whole congregation into the desert
[44:34] of Zen in the first month. And the
[44:37] people charred
[44:42] in Kadesh. And uh wait a minute, I got
[44:45] my the first month. And the people abode
[44:49] in Kadesh. And Mariam died there and was
[44:52] buried there. And there was no water for
[44:56] the congregation.
[44:59] And they gathered themselves together
[45:01] against Moses and against Aaron. And the
[45:03] people shouted with Moses and spake,
[45:06] saying, would God that we had died when
[45:09] our brethren died before the Lord?
[45:14] And why have you brought up the
[45:15] congregation of the Lord into this
[45:18] wilderness, that we and our cattle
[45:22] should die there?
[45:25] And wherefore have you made us to come
[45:27] out of Egypt to bring us into this evil
[45:30] place?
[45:32] It is no place of seed or of fig or of
[45:36] vine or a pomegranate. Neither is there
[45:39] any water to drink. And Moses and Aaron
[45:43] went forth from the presence of the
[45:47] assembly unto the door of the tabernacle
[45:49] of the congregation, and fell upon their
[45:52] faces. And the glory of the Lord
[45:55] appeared unto them.
[45:58] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[46:01] Take the rod, and gather thou the
[46:03] assembly together thou, and Aaron thy
[46:06] brother, and speak ye unto the rock
[46:09] before their eyes, and it shall give
[46:13] forth his water,
[46:16] and thou shalt bring forth them
[46:20] water out of the rock, so that
[46:24] so thou shalt give the congregation and
[46:27] their beast
[46:28] dream.
[46:30] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[46:33] reading of his word.
[46:36] And now I want to take far a text out of
[46:38] there an old scripture fell on my mind
[46:42] when I seen brother no
[46:45] of a a message that I used to speak on
[46:48] many many years ago. kind of forgotten
[46:52] most of it. What I used as a context,
[46:55] but I'm sure the Holy Spirit will reveal
[46:56] it to me as I go along. A subject is
[47:00] tonight, speak to the rock, and it shall
[47:03] give forth its waters. Give forth his
[47:06] waters. You notice it shall give forth
[47:10] his water. It shall give forth his
[47:15] water.
[47:18] It must have been a hot morning.
[47:21] Everybody was all confused and
[47:23] flusterated
[47:25] because all night long the cattle had
[47:28] balled and the the children had cried
[47:31] and the people had fussed and argued and
[47:34] quarreled.
[47:36] Poor Moses.
[47:38] It was a dreadful time for him.
[47:41] You see, he had come down into Egypt and
[47:44] had brought the children out according
[47:46] to the promise of God and was leading
[47:48] them to the promised land, a land
[47:52] flowing with milk and honey with a
[47:54] promise of God to protect them and to
[47:59] supply everything they had need of until
[48:02] they reached this glorious land flowing
[48:05] with milk and honey.
[48:07] Moses, a God called servant,
[48:11] ordained prophet, pillar of far over
[48:14] him, following him, confirming the words
[48:16] that he spoke with, but signs and
[48:18] wonders on his road to the promised land
[48:21] with the children. A very
[48:24] definitely antype or type rather of the
[48:28] journey today. We are on our road to the
[48:31] promised land
[48:34] and we are being led by the great Holy
[48:36] Spirit as they was led in the natural.
[48:39] We are led in the spiritual to this
[48:41] great promised land that God made the
[48:45] promise and gave to us.
[48:48] God had promised them to supply all
[48:50] their needs. But their carnal minds had
[48:55] taken them out of the divine will of God
[48:58] and had given them a desert route.
[49:02] That's a whole lot of it today. That's
[49:04] what's the matter with many of our
[49:05] churches. They've taken the carnal
[49:08] intellectual route and it's been cut off
[49:10] the supplies of God's blessings of
[49:12] healing and power and the baptism of the
[49:15] Holy Ghost and have took the desert
[49:18] route. Therefore, we have arguings and
[49:22] fusses and stews and complaints. But
[49:25] those who are still remaining in the
[49:28] way, it's joy unspeakable and full of
[49:31] glory with God with his pillar aar over
[49:35] them with power, with joy, with signs
[49:39] and wonder. How the real born again
[49:42] church is moving on to the promised
[49:44] land. the promise of eternal life. A
[49:48] land flowing with eternal life where
[49:51] there's no more sickness, death, sorrow,
[49:53] nor nothing to harm. Now, but when
[49:58] carnal minds begin to come among them,
[50:01] it finally drove them off the main path
[50:03] into the desert.
[50:05] They made their fatal mistake when they
[50:08] failed to go on. They were on their
[50:11] journey. Not very many miles. They could
[50:13] have made it in a few days. with all
[50:16] this 2 million people out into the
[50:17] desert if they had have stayed on the
[50:20] path. But when they come to a place
[50:23] called Kadesh Barnea, Kadesh Barnea at
[50:26] one time I'm told was a great judgment
[50:28] seat. It says a great spring or well
[50:31] there many little wells, a perfect hype
[50:35] of the church. The church is the
[50:38] judgment seat where heaven is a great
[50:41] judgment seat of God. And the little
[50:44] wells represent the little churches all
[50:47] out. And judgment begins at the house of
[50:51] God. See, here's where the judgment
[50:54] begins. That's why I don't see why so
[50:56] many complain that I speak too hard and
[51:00] try to uh make people straighten up and
[51:03] tell them the way they're living, the
[51:05] way they're dressing, and tell me I'm
[51:06] hurting my ministry. When the judgment
[51:08] seat is the house of God. That's right.
[51:11] Here's where it's to begin at. Right
[51:13] here where justice and righteous and
[51:16] judgment of God is to go forth from the
[51:18] pulpit. Now, when they got there, they
[51:22] camped. God had been good to them.
[51:24] Showed them many great wonders and signs
[51:27] down in Egypt on their journey. He had
[51:29] prepared everything for them. But still,
[51:34] they had to come to this place which was
[51:36] almost in sight of the promised land.
[51:39] just a little while after they had left.
[51:42] And when they got to this place, Moses
[51:45] took a man out of each tribe and sent
[51:47] him over into Canaan to spy out the
[51:50] land. We're all acquainted with the
[51:52] story how they come to two of them up to
[51:56] Jericho and how the harlot had hid the
[51:58] spies and so forth and all. When they
[52:00] went into the land, they searched it out
[52:02] to see if they the promise was right.
[52:06] When they returned back, they brought
[52:08] bunches of grapes that had taken two men
[52:11] to pack one bunch of grapes. I've often
[52:14] thought, if a land with a curse on it
[52:17] would grow that kind of grapes, what
[52:19] will it be when the curse is taken off?
[52:21] What a bunch of grapes it'll be. Oh my.
[52:25] I I I just get a little foretaste of it
[52:28] once in a while. I was preaching here
[52:30] not long ago. I was thinking this
[52:31] morning, I do a lot of slobbering, you
[52:33] know, I guess when I'm preaching, but
[52:35] I've been eating some of them grapes
[52:36] that's been brought back and it kind of
[52:38] causes me to slobber a little, you know,
[52:40] like a horse eating clover. So then when
[52:42] we when they come back, they brought
[52:45] this great bunch of grapes and they all
[52:49] gathered before the congregation of the
[52:51] large and they brought a report. Oh, God
[52:54] has told the truth. The land is flowing
[52:58] with milk and honey. It's a good land.
[53:02] It's a land of steed. It'll grow
[53:03] anything. Oh, it's a wonderful place. We
[53:06] got plenty of water and rivers and
[53:08] irrigations and everything to make a
[53:11] great nation. But oh, the the Amorites
[53:16] and the Hatites and the all the others
[53:19] are there. Some of them are giants and
[53:22] we look like little grasshoppers. And
[53:24] when they begin to say that all the
[53:27] strength left the children of Israel,
[53:29] they begin to cry and to scream. They
[53:32] had left Egypt and come up all these
[53:34] things and that had taken place. But
[53:37] there was two out of the whole 12 of
[53:41] them. There were two that had
[53:43] confidence.
[53:45] Rest of them said, "We can't do it. We
[53:47] just can't go any farther. We're it's
[53:50] impossible for us to meet that kind of
[53:52] people." But Caleb and Joshua said, "We
[53:56] are more than able to take it." Why was
[53:59] it? The others, the one with the
[54:01] intellectual part, was looking at what
[54:04] the giants look like. But Caleb and
[54:07] Joshua was looking at the promise that
[54:09] God had given. Now, it all depends on
[54:12] what you're looking at. There's people
[54:15] sitting here tonight that was in
[54:17] wheelchairs a night or two ago. They're
[54:19] up walking around now. It depends on
[54:22] what you look at. If you look at your
[54:24] affliction, you'll never go any farther.
[54:27] But if you look at the promise of God,
[54:29] you got a right to every redemptive
[54:31] blessing that God promised in his word
[54:33] is yours.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Right? The Christian always looks at the
[54:39] unseen thing.
[54:41] Every redemptive blessing of God is
[54:43] unseen.
[54:45] The here's the whole armor of the
[54:47] Christian. love, joy, faith,
[54:49] longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[54:51] gentleness, patience. It's all unseen
[54:54] forces at works in the heart of a
[54:56] believer.
[54:58] Amen. That's right. We look at things we
[55:02] do not see. If we're the children of
[55:05] Abraham, then we don't walk by sight. We
[55:08] walk by faith. For Abraham walked by
[55:11] faith and called those things which were
[55:13] not as though they were, because God
[55:16] said so.
[55:18] Now, Joshua had no way of knowing he
[55:22] could take that city. Caleb had no way
[55:25] of knowing it. But here's how they
[55:27] believed it. Because God said, "I have
[55:29] given you this land. I've got an angel
[55:32] that'll go before you. My take heed that
[55:35] you don't despise him because my name is
[55:38] in him. He won't pardon your sins. He'll
[55:40] carry you across the the fireplace.
[55:42] He'll ruffle up your feathers. He'll
[55:45] He'll do things for you. But remember,
[55:48] follow him. He'll lead you to the
[55:50] promised land. But don't despise him.
[55:53] Don't reject him. Believe him. Now, and
[55:57] then we noticed in in the journey,
[56:01] Joshua had found out that he'd seen that
[56:04] great God living there in that pillar of
[56:07] fire had performed all kinds of
[56:09] miracles. He and Caleb had seen that.
[56:11] And they had confidence that God would
[56:14] keep his word. Watch God. Way down in
[56:17] Egypt, I've given you the land. Now go
[56:20] and possess it. God's given every sick
[56:24] person in here divine healing.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Every one of you. Jesus was wounded for
[56:29] our transgressions. With his stripes, we
[56:31] were healed. It's yours. But you'll have
[56:34] to fight forever. It's you for that.
[56:38] Everywhere the soul to your feet
[56:40] travels, God told Joshua Joshua, I have
[56:42] given you. Footprint means possession.
[56:46] Let's move in tonight. Amen.
[56:49] Let's go in. Footprint is possession.
[56:53] Let's take every inch of ground that God
[56:55] giveth. If you haven't got the baptism
[56:57] of the Holy Ghost, Peter said, "The
[56:59] promise is unto you and to your
[57:00] children, to them as far off, even as
[57:02] many as the Lord our God shall call."
[57:05] Put Prince his possession. Let's go get
[57:06] it. our
[57:10] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[57:12] and forever. Let's possess it. The works
[57:15] that I do shall you do also. Let's
[57:17] possess it. It's God's promise. Don't
[57:20] look at the circumstances. Don't look
[57:22] how hard it is. Let's possess the land.
[57:26] We'll have a meeting. Like this morning
[57:28] we were having a meeting there and the
[57:30] Holy Ghost falling in the place the
[57:32] people screaming shouting praising the
[57:34] Lord and then some one come up and said
[57:37] pray for me brother Random I laid your
[57:39] hands on him and prayed for him I said
[57:41] now go and believe now here's what it is
[57:43] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[57:47] see it when you believe but then when it
[57:50] comes to the showdown are you able to
[57:53] possess the thing that you profess to
[57:55] have that's the thing brethren We've got
[57:58] to get it. We've got to take it. It's
[58:00] ours. But you'll fight for every inch.
[58:03] Joshua wave fought every inch of ground
[58:05] from one end of the country to the
[58:06] other. But he had a promise. God said,
[58:09] "I'll give it to you." Amen.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Whether there's giants, whether there's
[58:15] atheists, whether there's infidels,
[58:16] whether there's cold farm oral churches,
[58:18] what difference does it make? God gives
[58:20] us
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:22] our
[58:24] it belongs to us. is our possession.
[58:28] Let's go get it. Don't be afraid. Don't
[58:30] stand back. Say, "Well, I believe the
[58:31] days of miracles has passed." Oh, I
[58:34] don't know. Don't do that. That don't
[58:36] look like a child of Abraham. No matter
[58:39] how far along the promise seemed to hold
[58:41] out, well, it went on for 25 years. But
[58:44] instead of Abraham getting weaker, he
[58:46] got stronger all the time. For you know,
[58:48] it would be a greater miracle all the
[58:50] time. And we'll be prayed for one night
[58:52] and the next morning we still got a bad
[58:53] stomach. We say, "Maybe I never got the
[58:55] healing. That's gone through the line
[58:56] again." Oh, you call yourself a child of
[59:00] Abraham. Hallelujah.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; If God made the promise, God gave the
[59:04] promise, and you believe it, I don't
[59:07] care what takes place. It's short. Fight
[59:09] the devil on every ground he stands on.
[59:12] Walk over and take it. Take the sword of
[59:15] the word. God's promises is true.
[59:18] Nothing can stop them. They're God's
[59:20] promises. He give us the promise of that
[59:23] just like he did the children of Israel.
[59:25] The Pentecostal church has come to the
[59:27] Kadesh Barnea.
[59:29] Are we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ
[59:32] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:34] Can we walk up there and take a hold of
[59:36] God's promise and say, "It's the truth.
[59:39] I claim it. I own it. It's mine. God
[59:42] gave it to me. How you going to do it?"
[59:44] I don't know. It's none of my business.
[59:47] Like I was preaching one time on Elijah
[59:50] and a man told me after the service, he
[59:52] said, "Now wait a minute, preacher. I
[59:54] believe that you're a more sane man than
[59:57] I actually believe them crows bought
[1:00:00] Elijah fish and bread." I said, "I
[1:00:03] believe it every word of it that the
[1:00:05] fish was fried and the bread was
[1:00:06] cooked."
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "How do you where tell me then,
[1:00:11] my friend?" He was a Jehovah witness. He
[1:00:14] said, "Tell me then, my friend, where
[1:00:16] did those crows get that fried fish and
[1:00:19] baked bread?" I said, "That's not for me
[1:00:22] to question." It wasn't Elijah to have
[1:00:24] question. The only thing he know when he
[1:00:26] got hungry, the crows are sitting there
[1:00:28] bringing him the bread and fish and he
[1:00:29] eat it. I said, "That's the same thing
[1:00:31] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I
[1:00:33] can't tell you where it comes from, how
[1:00:35] it gets there. I know it comes and I
[1:00:37] enjoy it. That's all I care about. I
[1:00:40] can't tell you how divine healing works.
[1:00:41] I can't tell you how a black cow can eat
[1:00:43] green grass and give white milk, but I
[1:00:45] drink it anyhow. I don't try to find the
[1:00:48] formula of it. I don't know what causes
[1:00:50] the Holy Ghost to fall in a meeting and
[1:00:52] people speak in tongues and prophesy.
[1:00:54] People jump up from the wheelchairs and
[1:00:56] sick gets healed. I can't tell you that.
[1:00:58] Only thing I know, God promised it and
[1:01:01] it's our possessions. They take it and
[1:01:03] go with it.
[1:01:05] They can't explain how far it is to the
[1:01:07] moon or how many molecules is in the
[1:01:09] atom. That's none of their business. But
[1:01:11] the only thing they know, God promised
[1:01:12] that they got it and enjoyed it. Amen.
[1:01:16] That's where they made their mistake.
[1:01:18] When they come to the judgment seat and
[1:01:20] brought back the evidence of a good
[1:01:22] land, I'm so glad that there was people
[1:01:24] years ago who approached through all the
[1:01:27] formalities and went up and possessed
[1:01:29] the land and got the evidence and come
[1:01:32] back that there's a land beyond the
[1:01:34] river. Amen.
[1:01:37] I'm so glad of that. Now,
[1:01:41] they made their fatal mistake when they
[1:01:43] began to murmur against Moses and
[1:01:46] against God's service and against God.
[1:01:48] And it bypassed them. And remember,
[1:01:51] every one of them that murmured never
[1:01:54] went over into the land. Jesus said when
[1:01:56] he was on earth, "Your fathers did eat
[1:01:58] man in the wilderness, but there are
[1:02:00] everyone dead."
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Right? But I am the bread of life that
[1:02:06] comes from God out of heaven, that a man
[1:02:08] can eat thereof and not die. Oh, I like
[1:02:11] that. Pass from death and life become a
[1:02:15] new creature in Christ Jesus. Carnality
[1:02:18] had cut off their spiritual supply.
[1:02:21] Carnality had cut off all their joy, all
[1:02:25] and they begin murmuring and fussing.
[1:02:27] They chuck them off in the desert. If
[1:02:29] anything, I hate the desert. It's hot.
[1:02:32] There's nobody hardly can live there.
[1:02:33] And everything you get against in the
[1:02:35] desert's got stickers on it. Every kind
[1:02:38] of a little old vine's got stickers on
[1:02:40] it. You know why? It's because there's
[1:02:42] no water there. Now, if that same little
[1:02:45] plant growled up in my country or up in
[1:02:47] a country that's got rain on it, that
[1:02:49] little plant would not be a sticker.
[1:02:51] That little sticker would unfold and it
[1:02:53] would be a nice tender leaf when it
[1:02:56] comes into a watered place. That's
[1:02:59] what's the matter. The churches are
[1:03:00] either fuss and quarrel and stew and
[1:03:02] so-called Christians because they've
[1:03:04] been bypassed from the land of blessing
[1:03:07] from the fountain that never runs dry
[1:03:09] from the rock in the weary land and they
[1:03:12] have become dry and carnal and want to
[1:03:15] stick and days of miracles. That's a
[1:03:17] bunch of holy rollers. No such a thing
[1:03:18] as that. Oh, just let him come to the
[1:03:21] water one time. It just unfold and get
[1:03:24] tender and sweet and kind and humble.
[1:03:26] Something takes place when you put him
[1:03:28] in water. I don't know why, but it
[1:03:30] happens that way. Oh, carnality had cut
[1:03:33] them off. Look, here's what they had
[1:03:35] done. They had left the garlic pots of
[1:03:38] Egypt to eat angels food and was
[1:03:41] complaining. Could you think of it? Yes,
[1:03:44] we see it. They had also they had left
[1:03:47] the muddy waters of Egypt to drink from
[1:03:49] that spiritual rock, still complaining
[1:03:52] about it. They had left the boasting
[1:03:54] positions of Egypt that boasted how
[1:03:56] great they were to be with the great
[1:03:59] position that there wasn't even their
[1:04:01] clothes didn't get threadbearing or
[1:04:02] there wasn't a feeble one among them
[1:04:03] when they come from the wilderness still
[1:04:05] complaining. And then they had left the
[1:04:08] they had also left the people that said
[1:04:11] the days of miracles is passed to be
[1:04:13] with the people it's got signs following
[1:04:15] the believers.
[1:04:17] Now isn't that just the same today? You
[1:04:20] come up out of that old cold form of
[1:04:21] stuff, got the Holy Ghost and God fills
[1:04:24] you with goodness and you're drinking
[1:04:25] from that fountain that never runs dry
[1:04:27] and all them things there, joy
[1:04:28] unspeakable and full of glory and then
[1:04:30] go to complaining. Just the same thing.
[1:04:32] First thing you know, you're bypassed
[1:04:33] off out into the desert. That's the way
[1:04:35] God does it. It's just that way. The pe
[1:04:39] God doesn't do it. The people does it
[1:04:41] themselves. Their own carnal thinking
[1:04:43] does it. They had seen 10 powerful
[1:04:46] miracles performed down in Egypt. flies,
[1:04:50] life,
[1:04:51] fire,
[1:04:53] death angels, all they had seen in
[1:04:55] Egypt, all these great miracles that
[1:04:58] they had seen God do and were still
[1:05:00] cares.
[1:05:02] And then they saw the Red Sea that was
[1:05:05] laying in the path of duty. They were on
[1:05:08] their road marching then come out.
[1:05:10] There's a pillar of fire before them.
[1:05:12] And they marched on to the Red Sea. And
[1:05:15] when they got there, right in the line
[1:05:17] of duty, laid an obstacle and first
[1:05:20] thing you know, fear struck them and
[1:05:22] they didn't know what to do. That's the
[1:05:24] way people does today. When fear strikes
[1:05:26] them, when they're right in the path of
[1:05:28] duty, listen, brother, let me say this.
[1:05:31] If you're walking in the light, having
[1:05:33] fellowship with God with his people, and
[1:05:36] the Holy Spirit is upon you, and you
[1:05:38] meet an obstacle right in the path of
[1:05:40] duty, don't stop. Just keep pressing on.
[1:05:43] God will make a way through it.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; That's one of the greatest experiences
[1:05:47] of my life is to see God when I can't
[1:05:50] get over it, get under it, get around it
[1:05:51] or anyway, God opens up a way and I go
[1:05:54] through it somehow or another, his grace
[1:05:56] is sufficient to carry us through it.
[1:05:59] Now they come to that and saw that Red
[1:06:01] Sea open and what a great thing it was.
[1:06:04] How could they murmur? How could they
[1:06:06] complain after seeing those miracles?
[1:06:08] How can we complain today after seeing
[1:06:10] what we've seen? great revival, healing
[1:06:14] campaign, the spirit of the Lord coming
[1:06:17] down a discerner. The Bible said the
[1:06:19] word of God and Jesus was the word. In
[1:06:23] the beginning was the word. The word was
[1:06:25] with God and the word was God and the
[1:06:28] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:06:30] God crossed himself his own to his cast.
[1:06:34] God that created the earth became earth
[1:06:37] and lived in earth. God who made flesh
[1:06:39] become flesh and lived in flesh. Oh,
[1:06:42] that ought to attract people. God could
[1:06:45] have come out of heaven with a full
[1:06:46] angel salute if he wanted to. God could
[1:06:49] have come down a a full matured man.
[1:06:52] Angels on both sides coming down the
[1:06:54] corner of heaven sounding the trumpets
[1:06:55] of heaven. He He could have done that.
[1:06:58] He could have come a full man, but he
[1:06:59] chose to come a baby. He could have been
[1:07:02] born in a palace. He could have been
[1:07:04] created in the heavens if he wanted to.
[1:07:06] But he chose to come not to even a bed
[1:07:08] to be born. He went to a manger on a
[1:07:11] manure pile and over a manure pile he
[1:07:14] chose to be born. It ought to be
[1:07:16] attractive. Jehovah crying like a baby.
[1:07:20] Jehovah playing like a boy. Jehovah like
[1:07:23] a man. Oh, it's a great mystery. It's a
[1:07:26] super sign to the people. Everybody
[1:07:28] wanting signs. That's the greatest sign
[1:07:31] that God ever made when come
[1:07:35] a super sign. Surely it would attract
[1:07:37] the people, but they get carnal. Go
[1:07:39] away. Oh, yes. I guess that's all right.
[1:07:42] Oh, it's more than all right. It's God's
[1:07:44] perfection working, making himself,
[1:07:46] crossing his chest, making a tent and
[1:07:49] living in his tent, stretching out among
[1:07:50] us, and living like we do. Amen.
[1:07:54] God, here it is. But it don't attract
[1:07:56] attention. The church gets carnal,
[1:07:58] bypasses, goes over, gets away from
[1:08:00] these great things. Now we find that
[1:08:04] they'd already seen these miracles. Look
[1:08:07] what was with them. They had a smitten
[1:08:08] rock with them. They could drink from
[1:08:11] it. They had a brash serpent with them
[1:08:13] for healing. Oh my. They had a a prophet
[1:08:17] with them that had the word of God. Over
[1:08:20] the prophet was a pillar of fire that
[1:08:22] was doing the leading and not one time
[1:08:25] had it ever failing.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:08:31] Oh, I I feel like shouting. Look, it
[1:08:34] hadn't failed. God doesn't fail. You
[1:08:37] cannot fail and remain God. Still God.
[1:08:41] The smitten rock, the brass serpent, a
[1:08:44] prophet, an atonement, a sacrifice,
[1:08:48] everything grace had provided for them
[1:08:51] already. And after God had done all
[1:08:53] those things, they were like a lot of
[1:08:55] people today has to be babyed around.
[1:08:58] God don't want babies. God votes men and
[1:09:00] women.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; I like old Buddy Robinson's testimony.
[1:09:04] He said, "Lord, give me the backbone the
[1:09:06] size of a slog. Put plenty of knowledge
[1:09:09] in a Gabriel into my soul. Let me fight
[1:09:11] the devil as long as I got one tooth
[1:09:13] left and then go until I die." That's
[1:09:15] what we need. Courage. Not a wishbone,
[1:09:18] but a backbone. A real spiritfilled
[1:09:22] heart filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:24] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:09:27] Living in a life, walking in the path of
[1:09:29] God, keeping his commandments, claiming
[1:09:31] every promise is your own property.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I know I act crazy, but
[1:09:38] if you felt like I did, you'd act the
[1:09:39] same way. All right, because it's good.
[1:09:43] Somebody said, "Boy, you've lost your
[1:09:45] mind." Maybe I have, but if I have, just
[1:09:47] let me alone. I'm more happier this way
[1:09:49] than I was the other way. So, just let
[1:09:51] me stay like this.
[1:09:54] I've walked in the city or heard a man
[1:09:55] say one time that a man come down the
[1:09:57] street he had a sign on his front of his
[1:10:00] breast like this way like it was picking
[1:10:02] him somewhere he said I'm a fool for
[1:10:04] Christ and on his back after he passed
[1:10:06] by the back said who fool are you so I
[1:10:10] just wonder now I'm going to be a fool
[1:10:12] for Christ and know him know him this
[1:10:15] that I know him in the power of his
[1:10:16] resurrection that someday when death
[1:10:19] takes me that last big channel sitting
[1:10:22] under my heart beats Every minute it
[1:10:23] goes towards that channel. But when I
[1:10:25] come to it, I don't want to come out the
[1:10:28] power. I want to walk there and wrap
[1:10:30] myself in the ropes of his life Jesus
[1:10:32] knowing this that I anoint him in the
[1:10:34] power of his resurrection that when he
[1:10:36] calls, I'll come out from among the dead
[1:10:38] leaving those things in the past of the
[1:10:41] high.
[1:10:43] Glory.
[1:10:44] Yes, sir. Brother, we need an old time
[1:10:47] Pentecostal Jackwood sin killing
[1:10:50] revivalist California. all other states
[1:10:53] and nations throughout the country.
[1:10:55] Bring back the power of God into the
[1:10:56] church again. We've come to a kadesh, a
[1:11:00] judgment seat, all these things still
[1:11:04] fussing, still complaining, pillar of
[1:11:06] fire over the prophets. His words was
[1:11:10] perfect smitten rock surfing, miracles
[1:11:14] and signs they've done from it. Then
[1:11:15] still complaining. Oh, just
[1:11:19] eating angels food is still a garlic.
[1:11:22] Want to go back to the old garlic pots.
[1:11:24] It showed they wasn't ready to go in the
[1:11:26] can. That's right. You know, someone
[1:11:29] said one time I was preaching as a woman
[1:11:31] crying and she was just holding up her
[1:11:33] hands and crying, praising God. The Holy
[1:11:35] Spirit was out. The woman was filled
[1:11:37] with the Holy Ghost. How can a magnet
[1:11:39] draw anything unless it's magnetized to
[1:11:41] her? Correct.
[1:11:43] There was a man who belonged to another
[1:11:45] church, a friend of mine was standing
[1:11:47] outside. He said, "Billy, I was enjoying
[1:11:48] your sermon until that woman raised up
[1:11:50] and started crying." Said, "How in the
[1:11:52] world could you preach and her acting
[1:11:54] like that?" I said, "That's the only
[1:11:55] time I can preach." When I see the power
[1:11:57] of God away the church, caught away the
[1:12:00] message.
[1:12:02] He said, "It just made shivers run over
[1:12:04] my back." I said, "If you'd ever be
[1:12:05] fortunate enough to get to heaven, you'd
[1:12:07] freeze to death because they are crying
[1:12:09] and shouting and praising God day and
[1:12:11] night. Angels flying back and forth,
[1:12:14] crying holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:12:16] Holy. Now, let me tell you something
[1:12:18] right now, my brother. You're living in
[1:12:19] the quietest world you ever live in.
[1:12:22] Amen. If you go to hell, there'll be
[1:12:24] weeping, wailing, and nashing of teeth.
[1:12:26] If you go to heaven, there will be
[1:12:28] hallows and praise of God day and night
[1:12:30] for all time.
[1:12:33] This is the quietest place you ever
[1:12:35] lived in.
[1:12:37] Yes. Oh, how God wants to bless his
[1:12:40] church. They've seen all those things
[1:12:42] and still carnal mind. How quick they
[1:12:45] forgot all those miracles. When a a new
[1:12:49] thing arose, when a new trial come on,
[1:12:52] they forgot all they had seen. We do
[1:12:54] that. We have a meeting. The power of
[1:12:56] God will follow. Great signs and wonders
[1:12:58] will take place. Then Satan can come
[1:13:00] along and smack something over on you.
[1:13:02] You forget that that's the God of heaven
[1:13:04] that was just making you shout, making
[1:13:05] you praise his Lord. You forget the God
[1:13:07] of heaven that brought you out of the
[1:13:09] like a fire brand. You forget the God of
[1:13:11] heaven who dug you from the pits from
[1:13:14] the rock from where you was dug from.
[1:13:16] Easy to forget him. Let me tell you, my
[1:13:19] brother, what we need tonight is a man
[1:13:21] with a iron conscience that'll stand
[1:13:23] there in the power of the Holy Ghost. No
[1:13:25] matter what comes or goes, he's still
[1:13:27] waving that flag of victory going on to
[1:13:29] the promised land.
[1:13:31] He needs an eye. That kind of a church.
[1:13:35] That church unadulterated,
[1:13:37] sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:13:39] anointed with the Holy Ghost with signs
[1:13:41] and wonders, a shout of a of a king in a
[1:13:45] camp on their road marching on. Yes,
[1:13:48] sir. All of this of all this carnal
[1:13:53] stuff that they had done, all desert way
[1:13:56] over in the place like most of the
[1:13:57] churches are tonight, lot of Pentecostal
[1:14:00] there when the heavy burdens come and
[1:14:04] the people begin to cry. Oh, we would to
[1:14:06] God that we had died down in Egypt. Now
[1:14:09] what happened? God called Moses and
[1:14:11] Aaron into the his presence. Come down
[1:14:15] in the shai glory and bless them. God
[1:14:18] told the prophet said, "Go speak to the
[1:14:21] rock." Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; In the midst of all their sins,
[1:14:27] if God was want to put judgment up on
[1:14:30] us, there's none of us. But what has
[1:14:32] complained, we are worthy of going to
[1:14:34] hell. We're not worthy of our healing.
[1:14:37] We're not worthy of our salvation. But
[1:14:39] in the midst of all of it, that same God
[1:14:42] that forgave their sins and all their
[1:14:44] doubting, he still said, "Speak to the
[1:14:46] rock.
[1:14:48] And it will bring forth his waters.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. No matter what
[1:14:54] place, still speak to the rock in their
[1:14:57] sin. Still speak to the rock. Right in
[1:14:59] the day when the churches are all so
[1:15:01] infying and stewing, one who says, "I'm
[1:15:04] this, the other, and I'm that." One's
[1:15:05] this, that, and the other. don't have
[1:15:06] enough to examine that God right in the
[1:15:09] midst of all of this still sends his
[1:15:10] Holy Spirit. Still sends his power,
[1:15:13] still heals the sick, still shows the
[1:15:15] sign of the Messiah living among the
[1:15:17] people, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:15:19] forever in the midst of our carnal
[1:15:21] quaries today.
[1:15:25] Look at them. Many of them said, "Well,
[1:15:27] now if that's all you can do, here we
[1:15:30] are camped out into the desert. We've
[1:15:32] dug in every spring. We dug on ever oas
[1:15:35] and there's no water and yet the very
[1:15:37] driest place in all the desert was that
[1:15:40] old rock up there on the hill. Go speak
[1:15:42] to the rock. How God does things. It
[1:15:46] just confuses the connal mind. They just
[1:15:47] don't know what to do about it. Now the
[1:15:50] dest place in the desert is the rock.
[1:15:52] Anybody knows that? Well, if there's no
[1:15:54] if they can't find any water in the old
[1:15:56] time springs, then how are they going to
[1:15:59] find it in the rock? If they can't find
[1:16:01] divine healing in the great church of
[1:16:04] this name, if there's any divine
[1:16:05] healing, would it be in this great
[1:16:06] church that we belong to? Or it be in
[1:16:08] this great church that we belong to, the
[1:16:10] old springs. How in the world are you
[1:16:12] going to find one now to go up there on
[1:16:14] top of the mountain and speak to that
[1:16:15] rock when there's old water up there to
[1:16:18] begin with? But the thing of it was it
[1:16:20] isn't how it looks. It's taking God at
[1:16:22] his word. Speak anyhow.
[1:16:26] If the doctor turns you down that cancer
[1:16:28] is going to kill you, how would it be
[1:16:30] for a man to lay hands on you? Don't
[1:16:32] make any difference what it looks like,
[1:16:34] how foolish it looks to sign. God said
[1:16:36] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:16:38] they shall recover.
[1:16:41] No matter what it looks like, you mean
[1:16:43] in a day like this when we got all the
[1:16:45] culture and all the all the culture
[1:16:48] always thought of culture. Yeah, that
[1:16:50] that's a great thing. Uhhuh. My opin my
[1:16:52] opinion of culture is a man that hasn't
[1:16:55] got nerve enough to kill a rabbit but
[1:16:57] can eat a belly full of it if somebody
[1:16:59] else kills it. Oh my. What we need today
[1:17:03] is not culture. What we need today is
[1:17:05] the Holy Ghost to bring faith in us to
[1:17:07] the word of the living God. Exactly
[1:17:10] right. In this great day of education,
[1:17:12] this great day of science, what does
[1:17:14] that mean to God? Why the the science
[1:17:17] one time built a a great big tower was
[1:17:19] going to reach all the way into heaven
[1:17:20] and God just sat and laugh at their
[1:17:22] ignorance and the thing he done is send
[1:17:24] a little tongues movement down there and
[1:17:26] confuse the whole thing.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, God can just do what he wants to,
[1:17:31] can't he? Oh, he's God. He's God forever
[1:17:34] and more. Certainly notice what taking
[1:17:36] place here. Now, when we find that God
[1:17:40] told Aaron in the midst of all of him
[1:17:41] and Moses, "Go speak to the rock and it
[1:17:45] will bring forth his waters." How
[1:17:47] foolish that carnal mind. Well, if
[1:17:50] that's the best you can give me, just
[1:17:52] let it alone. Like Elijah one day when
[1:17:54] he went to pray and he sent his servant
[1:17:57] up to see uh if there's any sign of a
[1:17:59] cloud, he went seventh time when he come
[1:18:01] back. Oh yes, there's a little cloud
[1:18:03] about the size of the man's hand over in
[1:18:05] the west over there. He said, "Roll up
[1:18:07] the rain barrel. I hear the sound of
[1:18:09] abundance of rain coming." What was it?
[1:18:12] While the while the carnal mind would
[1:18:14] have caught that quickly and said,
[1:18:15] "Well, if that's the best you can give
[1:18:16] me, if that's all you can do, oh
[1:18:19] brother, how much more sign of that we
[1:18:21] got of the living God among us tonight."
[1:18:24] How we have we passed from death under
[1:18:26] life. The baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[1:18:28] come up on us. Jesus heals us. Jesus
[1:18:30] saves us. Jesus seals us with the Holy
[1:18:32] Ghost. Jesus comes down and shows
[1:18:34] miracles, discerns the heart, does the
[1:18:36] sign, the pillar of fire, the picture's
[1:18:39] taken, it's here now. The same Jesus was
[1:18:41] yesterday is the same yesterday, today,
[1:18:43] and forever.
[1:18:45] Jesus said when he was asked that you're
[1:18:47] a man be up 50 years old and say, "You
[1:18:48] seen Abraham?" He said, "Before Abraham
[1:18:51] was, I am." And I am was that pillar of
[1:18:54] fire that led Moses to the wilderness.
[1:18:56] When he was on earth, he said, "I came
[1:18:58] from God and I go to God." a little
[1:19:01] while and the world won't see me no more
[1:19:02] yet you shall see me for I I the prince
[1:19:05] of flow around I'll be with you even in
[1:19:07] you to the end of the world right and
[1:19:11] when he died buried resurrected about a
[1:19:14] few weeks later Saul was on his road
[1:19:16] down to Damascus and a great pillar of
[1:19:18] fire that led the children of Israel
[1:19:20] fell before him there put his eyes out
[1:19:23] and said Saul saw how persecuted thou me
[1:19:25] said who are you Lord he said I'm Jesus
[1:19:27] and it's hard to speak against the
[1:19:29] priest what was it he come from God,
[1:19:31] dwelt in flesh, returned back to God.
[1:19:34] That same pillar of power, that same
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost is with us tonight, doing the
[1:19:38] same work, the same time, the same
[1:19:40] everything else, proving that he is the
[1:19:43] same yesterday and forever.
[1:19:46] The woman can touch the hem of his
[1:19:47] garment. Oh, the man can be told who he
[1:19:50] is, what he's done, how to get out of
[1:19:52] it. All by the power of the living God
[1:19:55] that dwells among his people.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] All right. Yep. Speak to the rock. Let's
[1:20:02] look at some people who spoke to the
[1:20:04] rock. Let's find out what taken place.
[1:20:06] The first man ever spoke to a rock was a
[1:20:08] man that got tied up in some theology.
[1:20:11] He made himself a set of fig leaves,
[1:20:12] Adam. He thought that'll do just as good
[1:20:14] as anything. But when he come face to
[1:20:17] face with God, he found out he was
[1:20:18] naked. What did he do? He spoke to the
[1:20:22] rock and the rock made a way of escape
[1:20:24] for him.
[1:20:26] the rock that was in Eden. There was
[1:20:29] Noah, another man who had preached and
[1:20:31] the people ignored and laughed at him.
[1:20:33] One day he spoke to the rock and the
[1:20:36] rock took him in the ark and tucked him
[1:20:37] away in his arms and rode him above the
[1:20:39] storms and down to the persecuting
[1:20:42] world. Yes, sir. Noah, there was a man
[1:20:45] named Daniel once who was in the lion's
[1:20:48] den. He went out into Babylon and he
[1:20:51] said in himself that he was not going to
[1:20:54] defile himself at the king's meat. He
[1:20:56] wasn't going to have anything to do with
[1:20:57] the world. Though he had to live among
[1:20:59] them people, but he wasn't going to
[1:21:00] defile himself. He purposed in his heart
[1:21:02] he wasn't. And one day the king throwed
[1:21:05] him into the lion's pit because he was
[1:21:08] walking in the line of duty. But he
[1:21:10] spoke to the rock and that pillar of
[1:21:12] fire come down and shut the lines off of
[1:21:14] him all night long because he spoke to
[1:21:16] the rock before he went to the pit.
[1:21:18] There was the Hebrew children who
[1:21:20] wouldn't bow down to the images of King
[1:21:22] Nebuchadnezzar and they thrown him into
[1:21:24] the fiery furnace and they spoke to the
[1:21:26] rock and the fourth man was standing in
[1:21:28] the fire furnace there the rock of ages.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:35] David said, "If I make my bed in hell,
[1:21:36] you'll be there. I'll take wings in the
[1:21:39] morning and fly away." Notice Hagar, she
[1:21:43] had been put out of her home. She had a
[1:21:45] little nursing boy, Ishmael. She went
[1:21:47] out into the desert, no place to go. The
[1:21:50] water had run out. What could she do?
[1:21:52] She had been raised in a home that was
[1:21:53] acquainted with the rock. And what did
[1:21:56] she do? She didn't want to see the baby
[1:21:57] die. So she tucked the little fell and
[1:21:59] laid him under a tree and went off a bow
[1:22:02] shot and fell down on her knees and she
[1:22:04] spoke to the rock and the rock forth his
[1:22:07] waters and that baby was saved. entered
[1:22:10] this space. While she was still sender,
[1:22:13] that fountain
[1:22:14] that the God who has seen me, she spoke
[1:22:18] to the rock for her dying baby. Can you
[1:22:21] speak to the rock tonight? Are you on
[1:22:23] speaking terms with him? Do you know
[1:22:24] anything about it? Joshua is w come over
[1:22:28] Jordan after made that great decision.
[1:22:30] He's still the people said, "We're able
[1:22:32] to take it." God said, "Joshua, you're
[1:22:34] the one who knows all about it. I'll
[1:22:36] just let you lead the children now." He
[1:22:38] got over to his first campaign. He got
[1:22:40] up against Jericho wall. He walked
[1:22:42] around it. He said, "Now, how am I going
[1:22:44] to get over it? How am I going to send
[1:22:45] them walls? They got all those rocks and
[1:22:48] things up there, their bows and things
[1:22:49] ready to shoot. And here we are out
[1:22:51] here, mostly unarmed, just what we
[1:22:53] picked up from the sparrows across our
[1:22:56] journey. And there we are. How am I
[1:22:57] going to do it?" Naturally, he saw a man
[1:23:00] standing with his sword drawn. He said,
[1:23:02] "Who are you? Are you our enemy? Are you
[1:23:05] one of us?" He said, "Nay, I am the
[1:23:07] captain of the host of the Lord." And
[1:23:09] Joshua spoke to the rock and a shout
[1:23:13] went out and the walls fell down because
[1:23:16] he spoke to the rock. Several hundred
[1:23:18] years later from that, there was an old
[1:23:20] blind beggar sitting on some of those
[1:23:22] stones that had fell from that wall. Oh
[1:23:26] my, the speaking of the rock have done
[1:23:27] been explained out of the church. There
[1:23:29] was no such a thing. But he was sitting
[1:23:31] there blind thinking about on that road
[1:23:33] when he noted Elisha and Elisha came
[1:23:35] down that same road arm in arm going to
[1:23:37] the Jordan just beyond there Joshua had
[1:23:40] spoke to this great captain of the host
[1:23:42] of the Lord he said oh if I would have
[1:23:44] lived in that day I would have spoke to
[1:23:46] him too and about that time a noise
[1:23:49] begin to come you know usually where
[1:23:51] God's at there's a lot of noise I don't
[1:23:52] know why it is but there's a lot of
[1:23:54] noise wherever God comes here come that
[1:23:57] same captain of the host of the Lord
[1:23:59] people try to get to shut up. But he
[1:24:01] spoke to the rock and the rock gave him
[1:24:04] back his sight.
[1:24:07] He They tried to make him shut up. They
[1:24:09] tried to hold his feet sitting there
[1:24:10] shivered in little old bare legs laying
[1:24:12] there in that sun and his little old
[1:24:13] withered arms and his old raggedy coat.
[1:24:16] But he throw that coat one side to the
[1:24:18] other and took off for he was ready to
[1:24:21] speak to the rock and the rock gave him
[1:24:23] back his sight. Hallelujah. That's a
[1:24:25] warning to every blind man in here
[1:24:26] tonight. Whether you're fiercely divine
[1:24:28] or physically blind, speak to the rock.
[1:24:31] He's a sight giving rock.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock. Yes, sir. The blind
[1:24:38] man, there was a woman one time went out
[1:24:40] to the well to get some water. She was
[1:24:42] in a bad shape. She's a prostitute. She
[1:24:45] seen a man sitting over there against
[1:24:46] the wall and she didn't know who he was.
[1:24:50] After a while, he said, "The woman, give
[1:24:51] me a drink." He went to talking to her
[1:24:53] till he found out what her trouble was.
[1:24:55] He said, "Go get your husband." She
[1:24:57] said, "I have none." Well, he said,
[1:25:00] "That's true. You've had five, and the
[1:25:02] one you're living with now is not your
[1:25:03] husband." She said, "Sarah, I perceive
[1:25:06] that a prophet. We know that there's a
[1:25:09] rock coming someday called the Messiah,
[1:25:12] and he'll do this." He said, "I'm he
[1:25:15] that speaks to you." I can see her drop
[1:25:17] that water pot, her big pretty eyes
[1:25:19] shine. Into the city she went, knowing
[1:25:21] she had spoke to the rock. Hallelujah.
[1:25:24] and she found water. She didn't come to
[1:25:26] that well to draw. Oh, she had spoke to
[1:25:29] the rock with little Martha. One time
[1:25:33] her brother was dead and was buried four
[1:25:36] days in the grave, rotten already
[1:25:39] skinworms eating in his body and she
[1:25:41] heard there was something in the city
[1:25:43] and Jesus had come. She went out there
[1:25:45] where he was at. She fell down before
[1:25:46] him and she said, "Lord, if you would
[1:25:49] have been here, my brother would not
[1:25:50] have died. But even now, Lord, whatever
[1:25:53] you ask, God thy
[1:25:56] brother shall rise again. Wow.
[1:26:00] Amen. And brought forth death out of
[1:26:03] corruption and rebuked death and brought
[1:26:05] life. Where a man had been dead four
[1:26:07] days, stood on his feet and lived again
[1:26:10] because he spake to the rock. The
[1:26:12] disciples one night was out on the sea.
[1:26:14] All hopes was gone. And what happened?
[1:26:17] They seen something. It looked like a
[1:26:18] spirit coming to them. And they found
[1:26:20] out it was the rock. And they spoke to
[1:26:23] the rock. New hopes come in. And away
[1:26:25] they went. And the whole thing was
[1:26:27] spared because they spoke to the rock.
[1:26:30] Jas the little priest. His daughter's
[1:26:32] dead. All hopes is gone. Dre had to
[1:26:35] think of something. His wife saw him run
[1:26:37] get his hat. Where you going, Jas? The
[1:26:40] doctor's leaving the house. He's
[1:26:41] pronounced her dead. Her heart stopped.
[1:26:43] She has no more respirations. Been sick
[1:26:45] for several days. Now she's gone. He
[1:26:47] said, "Where are you going now? Once you
[1:26:49] got your hat, I just happen to think I'm
[1:26:51] going out to speak to the rock. And the
[1:26:53] rock brought forth life again into his
[1:26:55] daughter. Hallelujah. That's our God. If
[1:26:58] you need life, speak to the rock. If you
[1:27:01] need joy, speak to the rock. If you need
[1:27:03] healing, speak to the rock. If you need
[1:27:05] the Holy Ghost, speak to the rock.
[1:27:07] Whatever you need, speak to the rock.
[1:27:10] And he'll bring forth his waters. Do you
[1:27:12] believe that?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; What the church needs tonight is get
[1:27:15] back on speaking terms with the rock.
[1:27:17] The rock of ages, Christ Jesus, God's
[1:27:20] smitten rock. That's God's rock is the
[1:27:23] salvation of God. That's still our
[1:27:25] commandment tonight is whatever we have
[1:27:27] need of, speak to the rock and use the
[1:27:30] name of the rock and God will bring it
[1:27:31] forth his waters out of that rock.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I feel like I could run 100 miles. Oh,
[1:27:42] brother, I know that smitten rock thing
[1:27:44] right here now. Don't smite it anymore.
[1:27:46] Just speak to it. Just speak to the rock
[1:27:49] and it'll bring forth his waters. You
[1:27:51] believe that?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads and speak to him.
[1:27:55] Whatever you have need of, speak to that
[1:27:57] rock and see if he'll bring forth his
[1:27:58] waters.
[1:28:00] Oh God, have mercy.
[1:28:04] We know that thou art the rock in a
[1:28:06] weary land. You're a shelter in a time
[1:28:08] of storm.
[1:28:10] No wonder Jesus said, "If they hold
[1:28:12] their peace, this rock will immediately
[1:28:14] cry out." the rock. John said, "God's
[1:28:18] able these rocks to rise up children
[1:28:20] under Abraham." God, how we thank you
[1:28:22] that we could speak to you. We're so
[1:28:24] thankful to be on speaking terms. The
[1:28:26] blood of Jesus Christ puts us in this
[1:28:28] condition. I pray, Father, that you
[1:28:30] forgive every sin of the people in here.
[1:28:32] Take us all together tonight, Father.
[1:28:34] Forgive our sins, heal our sicknesses.
[1:28:37] May the Lord God of heaven show forth
[1:28:40] his power and his glory upon this people
[1:28:44] while we have our head bowed.
[1:28:47] I wonder if there's one in here
[1:28:54] that doesn't know him and like to speak
[1:28:55] to him for as your savior. Would you
[1:28:57] raise your hand? Say, Lord God, have
[1:29:01] mercy upon me and give unto me eternal
[1:29:06] life. Ah,
[1:29:09] will you raise your hand? God bless you,
[1:29:11] sir. Will there be another? God bless
[1:29:13] you, ladies. Will there be another
[1:29:15] someone else? God bless you back there,
[1:29:17] sister. Another say, I like to speak to
[1:29:19] the right brother. Do you know him? Yes,
[1:29:21] I know him. I'm acquainted with him.
[1:29:23] He's my friend. He's my savior. I spoke
[1:29:26] to him 31 years ago. He forgive all my
[1:29:28] sins. He's healed all my diseases. He
[1:29:31] gives me peace and satisfaction. Would
[1:29:33] you like for me to speak to him for you
[1:29:34] that you'd like to know him too? Someone
[1:29:36] else raise your hand. Say, I, Brother
[1:29:38] Brandham, would like to know him.
[1:29:42] Just raise your hand. Say, pray for me,
[1:29:43] Brother Brandon. I'll certainly do it.
[1:29:45] Lord bless you. There be another before
[1:29:48] we close. God bless you back there, sir.
[1:29:51] That's good. That's real conviction. God
[1:29:53] bless you over here, sir, to my left.
[1:29:55] God bless you. A little fellow back
[1:29:56] there, little boy. God be with you,
[1:29:58] Sunny. Make a preacher out of him.
[1:30:01] Somebody else said, "I'd like to speak
[1:30:03] to Lorra."
[1:30:13] All right. No one else. God bless you
[1:30:16] back there. I seen your hand just
[1:30:17] saying. I'm just waiting for a moment to
[1:30:19] see if there'll be someone else. Think
[1:30:20] of it now. Are you in the desert?
[1:30:23] Don't you know where to go? Have you
[1:30:24] been got off a real beaten path? Why not
[1:30:27] speak to the rock? He'll bring forth his
[1:30:29] water. That smitten rock was Moses'
[1:30:32] judgment rod. The judgment rod of God
[1:30:35] smoked the rock and it had a cleft in
[1:30:37] it. And out of that same rock, they
[1:30:39] found honey one day. Oh my.
[1:30:43] God's judgment smoked Jesus Christ who
[1:30:45] was a rock of our salvation. There's a
[1:30:47] cliff in his side. Honey is in the rock.
[1:30:49] As we said this morning, they find food.
[1:30:52] You find shelter in the time of storm.
[1:30:54] You find healing for your body. You find
[1:30:57] God bless this young girl sitting here.
[1:30:59] Find whatever you have need of. It's in
[1:31:02] the rock.
[1:31:05] Would you just believe him now with all
[1:31:07] your heart?
[1:31:15] All right. I got your hand back there
[1:31:17] again. I'm just waiting waiting to see
[1:31:19] what the Holy Spirit will say. All
[1:31:21] right. If thou can believe.
[1:31:25] All right. Our heaven.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:31] Amen. Aren't you glad we have a rock
[1:31:33] tonight.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And if the musician could come. Amen. It
[1:31:37] don't matter what generation, there was
[1:31:39] always a rock present. I I like what he
[1:31:41] said. He said that what the church need
[1:31:43] today is to get in speaking terms with
[1:31:45] the rock. that we can get in speaking
[1:31:48] terms to know that there's a promise
[1:31:50] that God has made for every generation,
[1:31:53] for every season of our lives. Every
[1:31:55] time when we run against something, we
[1:31:58] don't know what to do. Just speak to the
[1:31:59] rock. Amen. I trust it's your heart
[1:32:02] desire tonight. Why don't we just stand
