[12:03] we want to welcome everyone all our
[12:04] visitors
[12:05] glad to have you with us as you invite
[12:07] brother mike for our songwriting
[12:09] god bless you
[12:28] good morning
[12:32] you know one of the things we hear
[12:35] almost every day
[12:37] is a constant reminder to exercise
[12:42] you know we're being constantly
[12:43] bombarded it seems everywhere we go of
[12:46] the need to exercise whether it's from
[12:47] our doctor
[12:48] or from it's the health and fitness
[12:50] community
[12:52] advertisements our spouse
[12:55] sometimes are watching our phone
[12:59] constantly hearing you need more
[13:01] exercise
[13:03] and why what is exercise
[13:08] really you know most of us think of it
[13:11] in terms of well it means
[13:13] working out means doing you know
[13:16] jogging or push-ups or lifting weights
[13:19] or
[13:20] inflicting some other kind of pain
[13:23] but if you look at the definition in
[13:25] webster's dictionary it describes
[13:27] exercise
[13:28] as this the act of bringing into play
[13:33] or realizing in action
[13:36] the discharge of an official function
[13:40] or a professional occupation
[13:43] in other words it's bringing something
[13:45] to pass through action
[13:48] or to perform the actions associated
[13:51] with a position
[13:55] you know that's all exercise is in
[13:56] health and fitness
[13:58] really it's you know a person
[14:01] envisioning a target body image
[14:05] you know that they want to achieve or
[14:07] maintain and then they begin to perform
[14:09] the actions
[14:11] necessary to get to that condition
[14:18] exercise you know someone's a police
[14:22] officer
[14:23] they exercise the functions associated
[14:27] with that position you know it would be
[14:30] a perversion
[14:31] to see a police officer someone who's
[14:33] wearing the uniform to be doing road
[14:35] construction
[14:37] or roofing a house or
[14:40] operating on a patient you know someone
[14:43] who
[14:44] claims a position demonstrates the
[14:46] actions or
[14:47] exercises the functions of that position
[14:53] you know exercise is mentioned in
[14:54] scripture just a handful of times
[14:58] jesus said this in luke 22 25 he's and
[15:01] he said unto them
[15:03] the kings of the gentiles exercise
[15:06] lordship over them and they that
[15:10] exercise authority upon
[15:12] them are called benefactors
[15:16] so you know he was referring to the fact
[15:18] that in the gentile
[15:20] world there are there's kings who
[15:22] exercise
[15:24] their lordship their position and then
[15:28] there are those above
[15:29] them who give them power and exercise
[15:32] that by giving the power to the king
[15:35] so this whole idea of when you're in a
[15:37] position you exercise
[15:40] that position or if there's a goal or an
[15:43] objective
[15:44] that you're trying to achieve you take
[15:46] the exercise necessary
[15:48] to get to that position
[15:52] you know the word pops up here in psalm
[15:54] 131 we're going to read that this
[15:56] morning
[15:58] you know and this is david speaking
[16:01] a king someone who's in a position
[16:06] and also a man after god's own heart and
[16:08] he says this in verse 1.
[16:11] he says lord my heart is not haughty
[16:15] nor are mine eyes lofty neither do i
[16:19] exercise myself in great matters
[16:23] or in things too high for me
[16:27] you know i thought that was an
[16:28] interesting statement here he is a king
[16:31] and he doesn't exercise himself in
[16:34] things that are too
[16:35] great for him
[16:39] you know i thought as i read about that
[16:42] what actions or thoughts or goals
[16:46] or activities or objectives
[16:49] might i be performing actions for that
[16:52] are
[16:52] too high for me that are beyond
[16:56] my position
[16:59] you know if a medical doctor were trying
[17:01] to direct traffic
[17:03] or putting someone under arrest
[17:06] that would be too high for them they're
[17:08] operating outside of their
[17:10] position they're exercising things too
[17:14] high
[17:14] for them if that's true we as believers
[17:18] who have a god-given position
[17:21] you know are exercising ourselves just
[17:24] in the position we've been given
[17:26] and not in affairs outside of
[17:29] what concerns us as believers
[17:33] a reminder to stay in our lane
[17:36] you know jeremiah 9 has an interesting
[17:38] chapter verse in here i love this it
[17:40] says this
[17:42] jeremiah 9 23 thus saith the lord
[17:45] let not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[17:50] neither let the mighty man glory in his
[17:52] might
[17:54] let not the rich man glory in his riches
[17:58] but let him that glorieth glorieth in
[18:00] this
[18:01] that he understandeth and knoweth me
[18:05] that i am the lord which exercise
[18:09] lovingkindness judgment
[18:12] and righteousness in the earth for
[18:15] these things i delight
[18:18] saith the lord the disciples often got
[18:22] caught up arguing about who would be
[18:23] greatest in the kingdom or
[18:26] you know who would be doing the greater
[18:28] things and jesus once had to tell them
[18:30] what is that to thee
[18:32] follow thou me you know as he was about
[18:36] to
[18:36] ascend into heaven they asked him lord
[18:38] wilt thou at this time
[18:40] restore again the kingdom to israel
[18:43] and he said unto them it is not for you
[18:45] to know the times or the seasons
[18:48] which the father hath put in his own
[18:50] power but ye shall receive power
[18:54] is the position after that the holy
[18:57] ghost has come upon you
[18:58] and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[19:02] that's the exercise
[19:06] in acts 24 16 paul the first church age
[19:09] messenger said
[19:10] this and herein do i exercise
[19:13] myself to have always a conscience
[19:17] void of offense toward god and toward
[19:20] men
[19:22] and finally in first timothy 4 7 it says
[19:24] but refuse
[19:25] profane and old wives fables and
[19:28] exercise thyself
[19:30] rather unto godliness
[19:33] for bodily exercise profiteth little
[19:36] but godliness is profitable unto all
[19:39] things
[19:41] having promise of the life that now is
[19:44] and of that which is to come you know
[19:46] and that little word exercise really
[19:48] caught my attention
[19:49] as i was looking at that and you know
[19:52] sometimes i wonder how much
[19:54] we or you know just even me get caught
[19:57] up performing
[19:58] actions exercising ourselves in
[20:01] things that are beyond the position that
[20:04] we've been given
[20:06] and just i thought it was an important
[20:07] reminder from a king
[20:09] from a man after god's own heart to be
[20:11] thoughtful to be careful that we're not
[20:13] exercising in things too great
[20:15] for me for us but rather that we're
[20:19] focusing on that which god has given
[20:22] to us to exercise which is to be
[20:25] witnesses
[20:26] unto him so thought about that as we
[20:29] read
[20:29] we read psalm 131 this morning it's just
[20:31] a little psalm
[20:33] i think it's just three verses we want
[20:35] to read that together starting in verse
[20:37] one
[20:38] lord my heart is not haughty nor mine
[20:41] eye is lofty
[20:42] neither do i exercise myself in great
[20:45] matters
[20:46] or in things too high for me surely i
[20:49] have behaved and quieted myself
[20:52] as a child that is weaned of his mother
[20:54] my soul
[20:55] is even as a weaned child let israel
[20:59] hope in the lord from henceforth
[21:01] and forever amen
[21:07] amen god bless you and have your seats
[21:15] [Music]
[21:23] oh and do you know what it is
[21:27] not to have one guilty feeling not to
[21:31] wonder where you're going when you die
[21:49] oh yes that's just how it is
[22:02] [Music]
[22:09] [Applause]
[22:10] oh
[22:19] [Music]
[22:24] oh
[22:28] [Music]

[29:44] changed your life
[29:46] amen sister gina is a special he managed
[29:48] to
[29:49] come at this time amen
[30:17] um i just wanted to give a short little
[30:20] testimony um
[30:22] sorry
[30:31] if i can do it
[30:37] um as many of you know i graduated in
[30:41] may with my teaching degree
[30:42] um and at the beginning of the summer
[30:47] i started applying places and
[30:51] i interviewed with a school i student
[30:55] taught at they wanted me to come in for
[30:56] an interview
[30:58] and i went through two interviews with
[31:01] them
[31:02] and while we were out of town
[31:06] they called me and told me that they had
[31:08] picked a different candidate
[31:11] sorry
[31:17] so i was like okay um it's not exactly
[31:21] what i wanted anyways because the drive
[31:23] was far
[31:24] um so i just went on
[31:27] and um but when we got back in town i
[31:31] was like i
[31:32] don't have any other offers or
[31:34] interviews scheduled
[31:35] and you know most of the hiring for
[31:38] teachers were going on at the time
[31:41] so when we got back from our trip i went
[31:44] ahead and
[31:45] submitted a couple more applications to
[31:47] some different schools in different
[31:49] districts around
[31:50] our area in arlington but
[31:54] i kept getting emails that you know all
[31:56] the positions were filled
[31:58] and um
[32:01] so a couple days um
[32:04] after i had done all those applications
[32:07] and whatnot
[32:08] i heard from two schools in arlington
[32:12] and requesting i interview with them one
[32:15] of the positions i
[32:17] was interested in
[32:20] it was just something i didn't really
[32:25] want but the other school i was okay
[32:28] with
[32:28] it was a third and fourth grade um
[32:30] special ed position
[32:32] but i like the little kids more um
[32:36] it's just where i'm more comfortable um
[32:39] but i went ahead and interviewed with
[32:40] both of them and i ended up getting
[32:43] offered
[32:44] the third and fourth grade special ed
[32:46] position
[32:47] and i actually accepted the position
[32:50] when hr called me
[32:51] um they were like we want to offer you
[32:53] this job
[32:54] and we'll send over your paperwork to
[32:56] get signed
[32:59] that was last friday so i was waiting to
[33:02] get it notarized and whatnot that
[33:04] following week
[33:05] and that
[33:09] next saturday morning um i got an email
[33:12] from a director in mansfield isd
[33:14] um which is the district i originally
[33:17] wanted
[33:17] um but those were the emails i kept
[33:20] getting that
[33:21] all the positions were full um
[33:24] she wanted me to come interview for a
[33:26] pre-k position
[33:28] and um i looked at the school she
[33:32] was the director of and i was like oh
[33:34] wow this is so awesome it's basically
[33:36] like a
[33:38] children's museum in a school
[33:41] so i was like oh this is really cool and
[33:44] exactly what i wanted um
[33:48] but right before i had checked my email
[33:50] that morning i was at my current job at
[33:53] the private airport that i worked at in
[33:55] arlington and i had read
[34:00] proverbs 3 5 and 6 and it says
[34:08] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[34:11] and lean not unto thy own understanding
[34:15] in all my ways acknowledge him and he
[34:17] shall direct thy paths
[34:20] and i just happen we have big windows on
[34:23] um
[34:24] like i sit at a desk and there's just
[34:26] windows where we see the planes land on
[34:28] the ramp
[34:29] and there was just this huge rainbow out
[34:32] in the sky
[34:35] and actually a pilot walked in and he
[34:37] was like
[34:38] i was like did you see this and he was
[34:40] like yeah that's awesome the man
[34:41] upstairs put that there for me today and
[34:43] i said
[34:44] actually no i think you put it there for
[34:46] me
[34:48] so um it was right after reading that
[34:52] i saw that email and so i didn't believe
[34:54] that it was any coincidence
[34:56] um so immediately i called my mom and i
[35:00] asked her i was like would it be
[35:01] so wrong if i went and interviewed with
[35:04] this school because i've already said
[35:05] yes to the other position
[35:08] but i hadn't signed the paperwork or
[35:09] anything so it wasn't
[35:12] official necessarily so we talked it
[35:15] over and i decided
[35:16] to go so i went to that interview that
[35:19] following morning at 9am
[35:21] or that tuesday morning um
[35:24] and i just kept praying for god to
[35:26] direct me and lead me
[35:28] to the right place and um
[35:31] that same afternoon i got a phone call
[35:33] around four o'clock and it was the
[35:34] director offering me the job
[35:37] and it's exactly what i wanted and it
[35:40] doesn't feel like i'm settling anywhere
[35:41] that i don't want to be
[35:44] and the pay was the exact same and
[35:46] everything which is rare for
[35:48] school districts um so i just wanted to
[35:51] thank everyone who was praying for me at
[35:53] that time and
[35:54] i just want to thank god for reminding
[35:56] me that i'm not in control and he
[35:58] is and i just want to
[36:01] sing this song as a reminder of that
[36:22] i believe that you are god alone
[36:28] but sometimes i still try to take
[36:31] control
[36:34] cause i get scared when i can't see the
[36:38] end
[36:40] and all you want for me is to let go
[36:47] your parting waters
[36:50] making a way for me
[36:53] you're moving mountains that i
[36:57] can't even see you've answered my prayer
[37:03] before i even speak
[37:06] all
[37:09] [Music]
[37:17] i bring my praise before i bring my
[37:20] needs
[37:23] cause there's no fear you've not already
[37:26] seen
[37:29] i rest my heart on all your promises
[37:36] cause i have seen and know your
[37:38] faithfulness
[37:42] your parting waters
[37:46] making a way for me you're moving
[37:50] mountains that i don't even
[37:54] see you've answered my prayer
[37:58] before i even speak
[38:01] all you need for me to be
[38:05] is still
[38:08] and know that you are god
[38:11] be still and know that you
[38:16] trust that you are
[38:19] parting waters
[38:25] you whispered my name
[38:30] oh you answered my prayer
[38:36] your moving mountains
[38:42] your parting waters
[38:46] making away for me you're
[38:49] moving mountains that i don't
[38:53] even see you've answered my prayer
[38:58] before i even speak
[39:01] all you need for me to be
[39:05] is still
[39:11] be still
[39:18] [Music]
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:27] hallelujah amen blessed be the name of
[39:30] the lord
[39:32] amen is mindful of our needs and then he
[39:35] sees what we need he sees our desires

[39:41] the flowers and do all of that how much
[39:43] more we

[44:50] lot of um
[44:51] what do you call that high temperature

[45:25] forcing i think she was very
[45:27] uncomfortable um 20 minutes after that

[56:20] morning
[56:21] to be with us and
[56:25] continue to open your word to us
[56:30] bring us in remembrance of the
[56:33] things that you spoke to us father
[56:37] and father that we might find the food
[56:41] that's been
[56:42] stored up for us this morning
[56:45] that we might feast and grow we just
[56:49] ask you to bless us and help us
[56:52] in jesus precious and wonderful name we
[56:56] pray
[56:57] amen amen god bless you this morning
[57:02] we want to in welcome
[57:05] those that are us streaming we know that
[57:09] we have some that watch but we just
[57:12] always want to encourage you just
[57:14] never let streaming be an easy way
[57:18] that you don't make the sacrifice to
[57:20] come to church you know
[57:22] and and i i really feel that's one of
[57:25] the things that
[57:27] our society is doing right now is taking
[57:30] the sacrifice
[57:32] out of everything you know that uh
[57:35] try to make life so easy that there's
[57:39] sacrifice involved and the lord really
[57:42] appreciates
[57:43] your sacrifice so uh we're gonna uh
[57:46] continue on in our our study this
[57:50] morning
[57:51] and we're gonna read in the scriptures
[57:55] from in the 12th chapter of
[57:58] uh the fifth chapter of the book of acts
[58:02] if i could say that and starting with
[58:05] the 12th verse
[58:07] and we want to read from the 12th verse
[58:11] through the 33rd verse
[58:15] so that that's from
[58:18] acts 5 12-33
[58:22] that's a pretty lengthy reading so i'm
[58:24] going to have israel
[58:25] come and read that
[58:28] for me this morning
[58:31] he's going to be my new scriptural
[58:34] reader you know so
[58:37] we're going to ask him to read that
[58:39] scripture for us this
[58:40] morning if you would brother go ahead
[58:43] and read our scripture for us
[58:45] acts 12 through 33
[58:49] acts 5 12-33
[58:58] and by the hands of the apostles were
[59:00] many signs and wonders
[59:02] wrought among the people and they were
[59:04] all with one accord
[59:05] in solomon's porch and and of the rest
[59:08] there's no man joined himself to them
[59:10] but the people magnified them
[59:13] and believers were the more added to the
[59:15] lord multitudes both of men
[59:17] and women in so much that they brought
[59:19] forth the sick into the streets and laid
[59:21] them
[59:22] on beds and couches that at least the
[59:24] shadow of peter
[59:25] passing might overshadow some of them
[59:28] there came also a multitude out of the
[59:30] city's roundabout
[59:31] unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[59:33] them which were vexed with unclean
[59:35] spirits
[59:36] and they were healed everyone then the
[59:39] high priest rose up
[59:40] and all they that were with him which is
[59:42] the sect of the sadducees and were
[59:44] filled with indignation
[59:46] and laid their hands on the apostles and
[59:48] put them in the common prison
[59:50] but the angel of the lord by night
[59:52] opened the prison doors and brought them
[59:54] forth and said
[59:55] go stand and speak in the temple to the
[59:58] people all the words of this life
[1:00:00] and when they heard that they entered
[1:00:02] into the temple early in the morning and
[1:00:04] taught
[1:00:05] but the high priest came and they that
[1:00:07] were with him and called the council
[1:00:08] together
[1:00:09] and all the senate of the children of
[1:00:11] israel and sent to the prison to have
[1:00:13] them brought
[1:00:14] but when the officers came and found
[1:00:16] them not in the prison they returned and
[1:00:18] told
[1:00:18] saying the prison truly found we shut
[1:00:21] with all safety
[1:00:22] and the keepers standing without before
[1:00:24] the doors but when we had opened we
[1:00:26] found no man within
[1:00:28] now when the high priest and the captain
[1:00:30] of the temple and the chief priests
[1:00:31] heard these things
[1:00:32] they doubted of them where unto this
[1:00:34] would grow
[1:00:36] then came one and told them saying
[1:00:38] behold the man whom he put in prison are
[1:00:40] standing in the temple and teaching the
[1:00:42] people
[1:00:44] they went the captains with the officers
[1:00:46] and brought them without violence for
[1:00:47] they feared the people lest they should
[1:00:49] have been stoned
[1:00:51] and when they had brought them they set
[1:00:53] them before the council and the high
[1:00:54] priest asked them
[1:00:56] saying did not we straightly command you
[1:00:58] that you should not teach in this name
[1:01:00] and behold you have filled jerusalem
[1:01:02] with your doctrine and intend to bring
[1:01:04] this man's blood upon us
[1:01:06] then peter and the other apostles
[1:01:08] answered and said we ought to obey god
[1:01:10] rather than men
[1:01:12] the god of our fathers raised up jesus
[1:01:14] whom he slew and hanged on a tree
[1:01:17] him hath god exalted with his right hand
[1:01:19] to be a prince and a savior
[1:01:21] for to give repentance to israel and
[1:01:23] forgiveness of sins
[1:01:25] and we are his witness of these things
[1:01:27] and so is also the holy ghost whom god
[1:01:30] hath given to them that obey him
[1:01:32] when they heard that they were cut to
[1:01:34] the heart and took counsel to slay them
[1:01:41] that was better than me reading it but
[1:01:45] amen he reminds me of a great bible
[1:01:49] reader
[1:01:50] amen amen uh lord bless you this morning
[1:01:54] he may be seated
[1:01:56] certainly ask god to add his blessings
[1:02:00] to the word of the lord and
[1:02:04] and uh to the things that god's uh
[1:02:08] doing for us and uh so we're gonna
[1:02:11] continue
[1:02:12] on as we've been uh playing a portion
[1:02:15] of our this message easter seal
[1:02:19] and just going through it and taking out
[1:02:22] the things
[1:02:26] little nuggets if you would say it that
[1:02:28] way
[1:02:29] that would bless us to
[1:02:32] focus in on uh some of the
[1:02:36] uh things that many times might run by
[1:02:39] us
[1:02:41] and so we just trust that as we do this
[1:02:44] these things will
[1:02:46] be a blessing to you and and just
[1:02:48] there's
[1:02:49] there's some things that in general that
[1:02:52] our prophet of god
[1:02:53] keeps pointing out to us and
[1:02:56] uh and i think that uh
[1:03:00] we just want to touch on those before we
[1:03:03] uh listen to our
[1:03:04] portion uh this morning
[1:03:07] but one of the things that our prophet
[1:03:10] has been bringing out
[1:03:11] in this message is trying to bring us
[1:03:15] to the revelation and the understanding
[1:03:19] that the the transformation
[1:03:24] and the rap and the rapture or the
[1:03:26] resurrection
[1:03:28] the rapture being the final
[1:03:31] end of the resurrection but the
[1:03:33] resurrection process
[1:03:36] that the resurrection is going on now
[1:03:39] so it's not it's not something that
[1:03:43] is a future event but the living
[1:03:48] also participate in the resurrection
[1:03:52] and so it's been something that god has
[1:03:55] been preparing us for
[1:03:57] so he talked to us about how that this
[1:04:00] quickening power and that's what jesus
[1:04:03] said he said
[1:04:04] i will not leave you comfortless but i
[1:04:07] will come again
[1:04:08] and be with you and i will lead you and
[1:04:11] guide you
[1:04:12] in all truth and righteousness and then
[1:04:15] paul
[1:04:15] said that if you have this spirit in you
[1:04:19] this spirit that's in you the spirit
[1:04:21] that's in you
[1:04:22] will quicken your mortal body so we we
[1:04:26] always think of that
[1:04:27] as change but it's quicking it's
[1:04:30] quickening our mortal bodies right now
[1:04:34] it quickens us from sin to righteousness
[1:04:37] it quickens the way we think it's a it's
[1:04:40] something that is going on
[1:04:42] and going forward so god's dealing with
[1:04:45] us preparing us and and we're growing
[1:04:49] into the resurrection and he makes this
[1:04:52] statement he says
[1:04:53] notice you are now on your way
[1:04:57] growing to the full resurrection
[1:05:01] that's right so we're in that it's that
[1:05:04] and you say well why is that important
[1:05:06] it's important
[1:05:07] that in living in this world that you're
[1:05:11] mindful that you're a part of something
[1:05:13] else and you've got to stay
[1:05:15] within that realm you're in this you're
[1:05:18] in something that you've been called to
[1:05:21] and the world
[1:05:22] has something that they're trying to
[1:05:24] achieve
[1:05:25] they're trying to look for eternal life
[1:05:28] through science
[1:05:29] and through medicine longer days longer
[1:05:32] life they're trying to hold on to life
[1:05:36] but the beautiful thing about this
[1:05:37] quickening spirit
[1:05:39] it allows you to let go of this life and
[1:05:42] take hold of another life
[1:05:44] the gift of god is eternal life
[1:05:47] and so we we we've got we see that we
[1:05:50] understand that that
[1:05:52] we're we're not it's not just something
[1:05:54] we believe
[1:05:56] and one day we're waiting for the
[1:05:58] results of our belief
[1:06:00] uh this this life i like some of the
[1:06:02] brothers like to use the the term
[1:06:04] it's a journey you know paul called it a
[1:06:08] race
[1:06:09] you know it's something that we're
[1:06:10] involved in right today that's going on
[1:06:13] every day
[1:06:14] i kind of look at it sometimes like an
[1:06:16] obstacle course that
[1:06:19] you know the enemy is is battling we
[1:06:21] have an enemy uh
[1:06:23] one of the prophets said that life was a
[1:06:26] constant warfare
[1:06:28] but we realized that we're part of a
[1:06:30] plan
[1:06:31] part of something that god is doing so
[1:06:35] he makes
[1:06:35] uh uh references to the
[1:06:38] things that we are involved in
[1:06:42] right now and uh and so we we wanted to
[1:06:45] always keep that
[1:06:47] in our mind and then uh i believe also
[1:06:50] he makes this statement
[1:06:52] he says and you are quickened and this
[1:06:55] quickening power
[1:06:56] brings your body into a rapturing
[1:07:00] condition
[1:07:01] already so we see that word
[1:07:04] bring grow so
[1:07:08] we we don't want to ever get in our
[1:07:10] thoughts and this is going to be
[1:07:11] something that's brought out here and
[1:07:13] what we're going to listen to
[1:07:14] that i believe this now i'm just going
[1:07:18] to hang on to that
[1:07:20] and and i'm going to live my life the
[1:07:22] best i can
[1:07:23] with no understanding that there is
[1:07:26] going to be change
[1:07:28] in you there's going to be
[1:07:32] things that change god's changing he's
[1:07:34] going to
[1:07:35] change you'll hear the prophet of god
[1:07:37] say quick in your mind
[1:07:39] there's there's absolutely something
[1:07:41] that that is
[1:07:42] working within us transforming us
[1:07:46] and we know like a seed that like
[1:07:49] if we have an apple uh that little seed
[1:07:53] in that apple if you plant that
[1:07:55] seed in the ground in the right
[1:07:57] condition when it germinates it will
[1:07:59] grow into an
[1:08:00] apple tree and it will produce apples
[1:08:04] and every apple that ever was in that
[1:08:06] tree
[1:08:07] was in that seed and and but it had to
[1:08:11] go to that great
[1:08:12] process so as we look at these things we
[1:08:15] understand that
[1:08:16] we're talking about easter and that
[1:08:19] easter was the seal
[1:08:22] and the real seal of it the real easter
[1:08:26] seal is that what that he promised he's
[1:08:29] doing
[1:08:32] okay so it's not just looking back
[1:08:35] that he resurrected
[1:08:38] okay but understand that that spirit
[1:08:42] that was in him has now come into
[1:08:46] us and is quickening and transforming
[1:08:50] us growing us into the resurrection
[1:08:54] growing us into the statue of a perfect
[1:08:58] man
[1:08:58] transforming us to rapturing condition
[1:09:02] and so if we could not always look at
[1:09:05] the rapture
[1:09:06] as a calendar event but look at the
[1:09:09] rapture as a rapturing condition
[1:09:12] it's when you get in that realm that you
[1:09:14] possess the spirit
[1:09:16] you possess the rapture you have that
[1:09:19] power
[1:09:20] in your life that you know any moment
[1:09:23] now
[1:09:23] what's in me can create within me
[1:09:26] the faith to step right over into
[1:09:29] another realm
[1:09:31] it's going to open up and so it's it's
[1:09:34] not
[1:09:34] something that we believe and he drew
[1:09:37] the line
[1:09:38] i won't go read the quote but he says
[1:09:40] it's not this becomes the possession
[1:09:42] and not just the belief thereof so we
[1:09:45] believe in the rapture
[1:09:47] we believe in the resurrection we
[1:09:50] believe
[1:09:51] in heaven we believe it but so where it
[1:09:54] trans
[1:09:56] forms and changes in you
[1:10:00] from something that you believe to
[1:10:03] something that you actually know you
[1:10:06] have
[1:10:10] and he tries to give us examples of that
[1:10:14] so our minds can
[1:10:16] catch it he talks about a deed an
[1:10:18] abstract deed
[1:10:19] so when you've got the title deed and
[1:10:21] you've got the abstract deed and
[1:10:23] everything
[1:10:24] then you know that you possess that land
[1:10:29] there's not a question about
[1:10:33] whether you possess that land so once
[1:10:36] you get that clear
[1:10:37] title that means that everything
[1:10:40] that was laid against that property
[1:10:44] has been paid for
[1:10:48] i'll give you an example in our country
[1:10:50] for example people will sell property
[1:10:53] well you're supposed to keep that
[1:10:55] property mode you're supposed to do all
[1:10:57] these you're supposed to pay the taxes
[1:10:59] on it
[1:11:00] well maybe that person wants to sell the
[1:11:02] property
[1:11:03] so you go down and you go to buy the
[1:11:05] property and you find out that there's
[1:11:07] things held against that property
[1:11:10] there's mowing uh uh they
[1:11:14] they put uh uh liens on it
[1:11:17] so you can so that lien says if you sell
[1:11:20] this property you gotta pay this mowing
[1:11:22] bill
[1:11:23] and then there's back taxes that haven't
[1:11:25] been paid
[1:11:26] and there's all these liens on it and so
[1:11:29] you can't
[1:11:29] you you can't possess the property as
[1:11:33] long as other entities or other people
[1:11:37] have a claim on it
[1:11:41] okay so you have to make that claim
[1:11:44] right
[1:11:44] well satan had a claim on you because of
[1:11:47] sin
[1:11:50] but what did he do he paid the price
[1:11:54] he paid the mowing bill he paid the back
[1:11:57] taxes
[1:11:58] he paid all those things for you and and
[1:12:01] then he
[1:12:01] sends down his spirit
[1:12:05] to let you know that your sins are
[1:12:08] forgiven
[1:12:09] they've been paid for they're not laid
[1:12:12] to your charge
[1:12:14] anymore and that you've got a clear
[1:12:17] title
[1:12:18] and now you become a possessor
[1:12:21] and that's why you've got to accept
[1:12:24] what he did for you at calvary you've
[1:12:27] got to accept the payment for your sin
[1:12:31] and you say well i accepted that payment
[1:12:33] once
[1:12:35] well you know what every time that
[1:12:37] there's something
[1:12:38] that the enemy tries to lay to your
[1:12:40] charge you have to go back
[1:12:43] and take his payment and pay it again
[1:12:48] if you confess your sins he's faithful
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:51] just to forgive him he's not going to
[1:12:53] leave you he started to work in you
[1:12:56] he'll finish it he provided the token
[1:12:59] of the blood to be applied to your life
[1:13:02] so when you have a failure or you fall
[1:13:06] or or you stumble that price is still
[1:13:09] there
[1:13:10] it's a complete paid price
[1:13:14] all the way through so if you you
[1:13:17] just because you make an heir it doesn't
[1:13:20] mean that he has stopped
[1:13:22] what he's doing because what he's
[1:13:26] doing he did from the beginning
[1:13:29] he looked down he saw you he says this
[1:13:32] is my seed i spoke it
[1:13:34] i planted it it will do what i perform
[1:13:37] and then you're down here in the flesh
[1:13:40] you know having car wreck after car
[1:13:44] wreck
[1:13:46] you know daniel likes those car wrecks
[1:13:50] and uh and uh and and what does the
[1:13:53] father do he keeps them
[1:13:55] campaign the damages why because you got
[1:13:58] a
[1:13:58] assurance policy
[1:14:01] just like your insurance if that's paid
[1:14:04] it keeps paying you might go up well he
[1:14:06] paid the ultimate price
[1:14:07] so you've got an insurance so every time
[1:14:10] you have a wreck
[1:14:11] he's right there with the assurance
[1:14:13] policy i'll pay that
[1:14:15] i paid that i covered that i've already
[1:14:18] got that covered
[1:14:19] i already paid for that because when we
[1:14:23] were yet
[1:14:23] sinners he died for us
[1:14:27] so we never had to come to righteous the
[1:14:29] price was already paid
[1:14:31] for us through the blood of the lamb
[1:14:34] and so now we with that assurance
[1:14:38] you understand that even our faults and
[1:14:40] our struggles
[1:14:42] because we're growing and when you grow
[1:14:45] you make mistakes when you grow you do
[1:14:47] things the scripture talks as the enemy
[1:14:49] tempts us
[1:14:50] he puts something in our mind and then
[1:14:52] that drops into our life
[1:14:54] and it produces a work and sometimes the
[1:14:56] works aren't right
[1:14:58] now it's not the holy spirit that does
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:04] you understand so you can't say the
[1:15:06] spirit of god led me into sin
[1:15:08] or the holy spirit allowed me to do that
[1:15:11] that's the flesh
[1:15:12] and that wars against the spirit
[1:15:16] but so you can't say you know the holy
[1:15:19] spirit led me to do this
[1:15:21] that the grace of god would be abound in
[1:15:23] my life no
[1:15:25] god forbid that's exactly what it is
[1:15:28] it's unbelief but unbelief
[1:15:32] doesn't stop god and so you've got to
[1:15:35] always go back to where you left them
[1:15:38] always go back to calvary always apply
[1:15:41] the blood
[1:15:42] because there's only one place that god
[1:15:45] meets the believer
[1:15:47] and that's under the shed blood so
[1:15:49] that's what's sitting there
[1:15:51] you understand making making a petition
[1:15:55] on your behalf to the throne it can
[1:15:58] and every time that that there's a
[1:16:00] failure
[1:16:01] and and i know that we always look at it
[1:16:05] at sin as maybe some gross act
[1:16:08] but uh sin is unbelief
[1:16:12] you know sometimes if he tells you to do
[1:16:14] something and you
[1:16:15] you don't do it you know or you fail to
[1:16:19] live a sacrifice for him or
[1:16:22] or you know he would desire more of you
[1:16:25] and and a greater part in his kingdom or
[1:16:29] maybe he's commissioned
[1:16:31] you to do a work or he's he's called you
[1:16:35] to give more of yourself and you shun
[1:16:38] those things and you're not about the
[1:16:40] father's business and
[1:16:42] and you're you're doing other things
[1:16:44] that might be
[1:16:45] easier and more pleasing to the flesh
[1:16:48] well those things
[1:16:50] that that's a form of sin too
[1:16:54] but what's he going to do he's going to
[1:16:57] chastise you
[1:16:58] he's going to correct you he's going to
[1:17:01] deal with your heart
[1:17:02] the holy spirit's going to put you under
[1:17:04] conviction
[1:17:05] and it's going to pull you back to him
[1:17:08] thank god for that yeah and and i love
[1:17:12] the way that john put it he says a man
[1:17:14] who says he hath sin not
[1:17:17] is a liar but praise
[1:17:20] god we have that our petitionery
[1:17:24] and the blood of jesus christ making
[1:17:27] intercession for us
[1:17:28] on our behalf and supplying us
[1:17:32] the quickening power to overcome
[1:17:36] so this very quickening power that we're
[1:17:39] talking about
[1:17:40] this the spirit that god sent down on
[1:17:44] the disciples
[1:17:45] on the day of pentecost to bring
[1:17:49] alive in them he said now the spirit
[1:17:51] when it comes
[1:17:52] it'll bring you in remembrance of all
[1:17:55] the things that i said
[1:17:56] this great spirit that he sent down was
[1:17:59] sent down to perform
[1:18:02] the work that he desired
[1:18:06] to be done because we were hopeless
[1:18:10] and helpless to do this
[1:18:13] with our own intellect our own
[1:18:17] personality
[1:18:18] our own senses both outward census
[1:18:22] and inward census there was no way
[1:18:26] that we could ever get ourself
[1:18:29] in rapturing condition
[1:18:33] there's no way we could ever live a life
[1:18:38] to overcome we needed
[1:18:42] outside help you understand
[1:18:45] we needed something supernatural so
[1:18:49] even if you're it got a real bad habit
[1:18:52] going on in your life
[1:18:56] you you you need that quickening power
[1:19:00] to deliver you from that habit
[1:19:04] and that's there for you it's it's a
[1:19:06] struggle to try to overcome it
[1:19:09] that's right you know i mean
[1:19:12] here the problem comes from the flesh
[1:19:14] and we try to
[1:19:16] overcome it with the flesh and he said
[1:19:19] that it doesn't work you can't overcome
[1:19:22] the flesh with the flesh
[1:19:26] you know it's a failure that's right
[1:19:30] and and and the enemies he does
[1:19:33] everything he can to to war against our
[1:19:37] minds to war against our life
[1:19:39] the greatest thing that satan has in his
[1:19:42] arsenal is the rear-view mirror
[1:19:49] really that that that's the one of the
[1:19:51] greatest tools
[1:19:53] that he has is always bringing back to
[1:19:55] your remembrance
[1:19:57] well sure i can look back on my life and
[1:20:00] i just
[1:20:00] i don't know that there's any way that
[1:20:03] i'll ever
[1:20:05] make it even since i became a christian
[1:20:08] all the failures i had if i look at
[1:20:11] though there's
[1:20:12] no way i can i'll make it
[1:20:15] but i know there's a quickening spirit
[1:20:19] and it's by that spirit if the spirit
[1:20:22] that was in christ jesus be
[1:20:24] in you it will quicken your mortal body
[1:20:27] that doesn't mean the day
[1:20:29] of it it means the start of it it starts
[1:20:33] quickening your mortal body
[1:20:35] right then quicken equipment and
[1:20:36] changing so i know that if he's got an
[1:20:39] expected end
[1:20:40] if he's got a prophesied end and i've
[1:20:43] still got all these
[1:20:45] broken spiritual bones in my body i'm
[1:20:48] still
[1:20:49] struggling in all these things i know
[1:20:52] that that spirit
[1:20:53] will take control of that and he will
[1:20:57] remove those things from my life
[1:21:00] and perfecting me what he started
[1:21:07] and and so i i i now i realize
[1:21:10] that this power this quickening power
[1:21:14] this power in order to make me alive
[1:21:18] that's what's got to be working in my
[1:21:20] life
[1:21:21] so i got to move it from being something
[1:21:24] that i believe in
[1:21:26] to something that i possess something
[1:21:28] that i rely on
[1:21:30] something that i'm counting on to do for
[1:21:33] me
[1:21:34] what i can't do for myself
[1:21:39] yeah and you know it uh and i i know the
[1:21:42] world has a lot of medicines and a lot
[1:21:45] of things that they try to give
[1:21:47] to overcome and i'm all for them but
[1:21:50] when they
[1:21:50] when it comes to the point that they
[1:21:52] can't work anymore
[1:21:54] there's another power there's another
[1:21:56] answer from the great physician
[1:21:59] that can come down and do that work so
[1:22:01] so i say this don't give up on your
[1:22:03] friends
[1:22:04] don't give up on your loved ones don't
[1:22:06] give up on your children
[1:22:08] you just keep believing god because that
[1:22:10] quickening power can do all things
[1:22:13] right we're totally uh at rest
[1:22:17] in that so we read the scripture
[1:22:21] this morning and because brother brahm's
[1:22:23] going to mention this
[1:22:25] when we read about how they were afraid
[1:22:29] and how that they changed
[1:22:33] and so we we read the spiritual
[1:22:36] evidence of that they were put in prison
[1:22:40] and said you don't preach in this name
[1:22:42] the next night that night the angel
[1:22:45] comes down he says you go out and tell
[1:22:46] the people
[1:22:48] about this gospel and this life
[1:22:51] and there they are and they get pulled
[1:22:53] in front of the council and
[1:22:54] he says you're the guys that rejected
[1:22:56] them
[1:22:58] you know i i they they weren't afraid
[1:23:01] anymore
[1:23:03] and so we want to touch on that a little
[1:23:05] bit this morning
[1:23:06] and a few things if you would so let us
[1:23:08] we're gonna for those that have your
[1:23:10] phones
[1:23:11] uh i i never believe i say that but
[1:23:14] uh i uh
[1:23:17] you know that's just i tell people i got
[1:23:20] i'm i'm a old person okay
[1:23:23] i got books and so you know i i started
[1:23:27] out in this book and we started reading
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:30] and like i said they didn't come from
[1:23:33] the voice of god with all this mark on
[1:23:35] it
[1:23:36] but you know the more i get into it the
[1:23:39] more
[1:23:40] i marked and so here we are and
[1:23:43] this is how far we are right here
[1:23:46] well you notice the rest of it's not
[1:23:48] marked very much but
[1:23:50] we're going to have it all marked up by
[1:23:51] the grace of god huh
[1:23:53] just feed out of it feed out of it now
[1:23:57] here's the one thing that we want to
[1:23:59] establish as we listen to this
[1:24:02] is the prophet of god told us
[1:24:06] and i'm not ashamed to say that because
[1:24:08] he was a vindicated prophet of god
[1:24:11] promised he said the spirit
[1:24:14] has come to quicken the word
[1:24:18] the word doesn't make the spirit alive
[1:24:22] the spirit makes the word alive
[1:24:26] so you you so that's why
[1:24:30] the word had to come first
[1:24:34] so the word for our age had to come to a
[1:24:37] prophet
[1:24:39] the transitional of the age in other
[1:24:42] words
[1:24:42] the opening of the seals the
[1:24:45] establishment of the church age
[1:24:47] the revelation of the son of perdition
[1:24:50] who was that antichrist spirit
[1:24:53] so the word had to come and be
[1:24:57] preached that the spirit could come
[1:25:01] and quicken that word
[1:25:04] so it had to he so the seed in you
[1:25:07] is the is like the receiver
[1:25:11] you didn't receive it by your intellect
[1:25:13] you received it by revelation
[1:25:15] so the word came to you and you received
[1:25:19] it now the spirit comes
[1:25:21] and makes the word that you received
[1:25:25] come alive and put it in your life
[1:25:29] so many times you'll believe it
[1:25:32] you'll believe it you know it you listen
[1:25:35] to it you believe it i believe
[1:25:36] i believe but it still hasn't
[1:25:40] been made alive in you it has
[1:25:43] don't give up because that
[1:25:47] spirit is going to come and make it
[1:25:51] alive
[1:25:52] and i know people that have just
[1:25:54] struggled for a lot of time
[1:25:56] for a long period of time always in and
[1:25:59] out battling the world
[1:26:00] but you want to know some maybe 10 15 20
[1:26:03] years later
[1:26:04] after a whole freeway load of
[1:26:08] car wrecks one day they just say you
[1:26:10] know something
[1:26:12] this this means more to me than ever
[1:26:18] if he's not going to give up on you you
[1:26:20] don't give up on yourself
[1:26:24] you know so this spirit is here to make
[1:26:27] it alive
[1:26:27] i believe that you'll enjoy uh we're 17
[1:26:30] minutes and then we'll make a few
[1:26:32] comments
[1:26:33] and we'll go but i hope you're enjoying
[1:26:36] this so anyway we're going to start in
[1:26:37] paragraph
[1:26:39] 120 122.
[1:26:43] i believe yes
[1:26:50] okay so paragraph 122 of the easter seal
[1:26:54] through the end of paragraph
[1:26:59] 1 64 and then we'll just go back to read
[1:27:03] a few paragraphs comment
[1:27:05] but we we want to anchor into this
[1:27:08] message
[1:27:09] this word of god
[1:27:12] is the best weapon
[1:27:16] that god could have ever given you to
[1:27:19] fight the fight
[1:27:21] fall in love with it get involved with
[1:27:24] it
[1:27:24] let it speak to you so we'll cover of
[1:27:27] just a few things we'll talk about
[1:27:29] that all alzheimer says what stood out
[1:27:32] to me
[1:27:33] i'm sure there's things that will stand
[1:27:34] out to you so god bless you
[1:27:36] as we listen to uh
[1:27:39] the voice of malachi 4 5 echoing in our
[1:27:43] day
[1:27:45] so god richly bless you
[1:27:51] are we if we are ordained on that ground
[1:27:56] if we are ordained to be on that ground
[1:27:59] like the eagle walk into the chicken's
[1:28:01] nest amen
[1:28:03] if you're ordained on that ground the
[1:28:05] holy spirit is sure to find you
[1:28:08] and when it finds it you'll recognize
[1:28:11] this call
[1:28:12] you know the hour you're living you know
[1:28:14] these things you're supposed to happen
[1:28:16] quickly you're raptured up to meet it
[1:28:18] and now you're sitting in heavenly
[1:28:20] places in christ jesus
[1:28:22] oh what a promise what a heavenly father
[1:28:26] who would give us these things
[1:28:28] the spirit quickens their fellowship
[1:28:30] with god so
[1:28:31] that they call the dead back to life in
[1:28:34] that day
[1:28:35] they laid their bodies up on the dead
[1:28:37] they come to life
[1:28:39] listen closely they done the same things
[1:28:42] that jesus did because the same spirit
[1:28:44] was upon him was upon them
[1:28:47] if one spirit makes a man act this way
[1:28:49] it makes the other neck that way
[1:28:51] if one how can this come upon say he's
[1:28:53] got the spirit of god in the night of
[1:28:54] the works of god amen
[1:28:56] cannot do it notice god's life
[1:28:59] which is in the greek called zoe
[1:29:02] moving through them and in them
[1:29:06] quicken their minds to his word amen
[1:29:10] now let me say it real quietly
[1:29:13] the spirit of god
[1:29:17] that moves among the people quickens the
[1:29:20] mind
[1:29:21] of the person to the promise of god
[1:29:26] see it does it look i'm
[1:29:29] trying to show you the the let you
[1:29:33] realize that i'm speaking out of the
[1:29:34] church
[1:29:35] and also quicken to life in him you
[1:29:38] although
[1:29:40] uh they only uh or was his attributes to
[1:29:44] begin with
[1:29:45] but if god said in this day
[1:29:48] back in the beginning john doe will be
[1:29:51] my servant
[1:29:53] millions of years ago now john goes born
[1:29:57] and sinned shaped in iniquity comes the
[1:29:59] world speaking lives because he's
[1:30:00] immortal
[1:30:02] but maybe he gets a little religious
[1:30:04] feeling he'll go join a church
[1:30:06] maybe he'll join pentecostal church
[1:30:08] don't know
[1:30:09] he might join anything but let him get
[1:30:12] under the atmosphere of god once
[1:30:14] see john doe is bound to recognize
[1:30:18] who his father is just as that eagle
[1:30:20] recognized who the mother was
[1:30:22] it's got to realize it see only
[1:30:25] that john doe is god's attribute
[1:30:29] that's become a word spoken and then the
[1:30:32] holy spirit seeks that word out
[1:30:34] here it is he calls him gives him
[1:30:37] everlasting life
[1:30:38] and brings him into the presence of god
[1:30:41] god's word
[1:30:43] look god had the scene when he saw jesus
[1:30:46] it was it was a finished work that god
[1:30:50] finished with jesus when he said it's
[1:30:51] finished all the plan was finished
[1:30:53] and when the spirit of god comes upon
[1:30:56] you
[1:30:57] and you truly are one of god's
[1:30:59] attributes
[1:31:00] that he's spoken of now if you're not
[1:31:03] you'll wander and
[1:31:04] flusterate and run here and there and
[1:31:06] everything else and never come to the
[1:31:08] knowledge of the
[1:31:08] truth if you are
[1:31:12] one of those the old things pass away
[1:31:15] right quick see and you become new and
[1:31:17] the
[1:31:18] plan of salvation is finished you're
[1:31:20] ready to obey every word that god ever
[1:31:22] spoke of you
[1:31:23] see for you to do you're submissive to
[1:31:26] his word
[1:31:27] the contract exactly the abstract to the
[1:31:30] contract the title deed
[1:31:32] belongs to you the debts are all paid
[1:31:35] it's all struck off
[1:31:37] and as it was at the day of pentecost
[1:31:40] now let us
[1:31:41] notice the quickness this quickening
[1:31:43] spirit on other people
[1:31:45] now i told you i wouldn't speak very
[1:31:47] long and i just got 20 minutes to keep
[1:31:50] my word if i do that
[1:31:51] notice to keep it one time i said about
[1:31:54] about an
[1:31:55] hour notice now
[1:31:59] this quickening power
[1:32:02] that only comes now there's a lot of
[1:32:05] mockery of it
[1:32:06] there's a lot of people that really
[1:32:07] think they got it when they haven't
[1:32:11] lot of people do it because they have
[1:32:13] got some false
[1:32:15] impression of what they've seen other
[1:32:17] christians do
[1:32:19] satan can impersonate any of that we
[1:32:22] know that in his missionaries you can
[1:32:23] see it impersonated shouting dancing
[1:32:26] speaking in tongues all these things you
[1:32:28] still impersonated anywhere
[1:32:29] absolutely amongst heathens and people
[1:32:31] who deny there is a
[1:32:33] such a thing as jesus christ being the
[1:32:34] son of god see and they do
[1:32:36] all those things themselves but the real
[1:32:39] true quickening spirit that comes to
[1:32:41] believer
[1:32:42] quickens him to god's word that's back
[1:32:45] to eagle food again
[1:32:46] right back to where he lives man shall
[1:32:48] not live by bread alone but by
[1:32:50] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:32:53] mouth of god
[1:32:54] let us now notice this quickly spirit as
[1:32:56] it come up on other people like it did
[1:32:58] on on the day of pentecost let's notice
[1:33:01] pentecost how they acted and see if they
[1:33:03] were quickened by this
[1:33:04] quickening power that we're talking
[1:33:05] about
[1:33:07] on the day of pentecost they were all
[1:33:09] waiting up there in themselves
[1:33:10] they were afraid the jews what they were
[1:33:14] going to do so they got scared
[1:33:15] but what happened when this quaking
[1:33:17] power fell from heaven
[1:33:19] there was a bravery set up on him
[1:33:22] there was something an understanding
[1:33:24] worthy wasn't too sure of it
[1:33:26] a few hours before they know he had
[1:33:30] he died they know he had risen they i
[1:33:33] talked to him on the way but was that
[1:33:35] thing for them or was it just for them
[1:33:37] for jesus himself but here on the day of
[1:33:40] pentecost
[1:33:41] the holy spirit the abstract fell upon
[1:33:44] the believers that made
[1:33:46] them part of his resurrection
[1:33:50] made him part of his fellowship
[1:33:54] the holy spirit came and confirmed to
[1:33:57] them that they
[1:33:58] would be raised up because they were
[1:34:00] potentially
[1:34:01] raised in from cowards to brave man
[1:34:05] they were they were afraid of the very
[1:34:08] word
[1:34:09] that they thought don't let this pass
[1:34:11] over you they were afraid they
[1:34:13] know that he was that word even the jews
[1:34:16] had to admit it
[1:34:17] nicodemus said rabbi we know that you're
[1:34:20] a
[1:34:21] teacher that come from god no man who
[1:34:23] could do the things you do
[1:34:24] except god be with him now we know that
[1:34:27] we recognize that
[1:34:28] so the disciples peter had even sworn in
[1:34:31] his presence
[1:34:32] all of them had forsaken him at the
[1:34:34] crucifixion
[1:34:36] but here they are now up in this upper
[1:34:38] room
[1:34:39] in the presence of god then all of a
[1:34:41] sudden
[1:34:42] here come this holy spirit down from
[1:34:45] heaven
[1:34:46] and he quickened them and the quickening
[1:34:49] took place
[1:34:49] they wasn't afraid to make a witness of
[1:34:52] the message that they believed and know
[1:34:55] to be the truth
[1:34:56] amen otherwise they were afraid of it
[1:34:58] amen
[1:34:59] how many presbyterians how many
[1:35:01] methodists how many
[1:35:03] baptists in the world today how many
[1:35:05] pentecostals
[1:35:06] that's a knows the truth and are afraid
[1:35:10] to make a standoff
[1:35:12] i'm persuaded to wonder what was that
[1:35:14] fell on you amen
[1:35:17] are you a part of his resurrection would
[1:35:20] you
[1:35:20] dare scream off for some man's therian
[1:35:24] idea
[1:35:25] or have you got the real boldness and
[1:35:28] the
[1:35:28] the real manhood it takes to stand out
[1:35:31] and call right right and wrong wrong
[1:35:34] are you a part of his resurrection
[1:35:37] are you a worshiper of a bunch of creeds
[1:35:40] are you a gourd at church do you have
[1:35:42] your name on there and dead and sin and
[1:35:43] trespasses
[1:35:44] he that believes not the full word of
[1:35:46] god is a sinner
[1:35:48] those pharisees believed in many things
[1:35:50] to be the truth
[1:35:52] they said we're god's children and they
[1:35:54] were until that
[1:35:56] word was preached but when that word was
[1:35:58] preached and vindicated
[1:36:00] then they become sinners for rejecting
[1:36:03] the thing that they
[1:36:04] know was right and witnessed that we
[1:36:06] know the heart of teacher come from god
[1:36:09] for no man can do the things that you do
[1:36:11] without god being with you
[1:36:13] i wonder today where are we at
[1:36:16] a question where is this resurrection
[1:36:19] finding us
[1:36:20] are you dare to step out are you dare to
[1:36:24] take god at his word
[1:36:25] that's it if you're ordained alive you
[1:36:29] sure will do it
[1:36:30] if you're an eagle you can't help doing
[1:36:32] it amen there's something in you
[1:36:34] or do you want to just serve a creed
[1:36:36] somewhere say i go to church i'm just as
[1:36:37] good as you are
[1:36:39] see if you hold no birthrights
[1:36:42] you will never see it you can't see it
[1:36:45] but if you do hold the possession of
[1:36:48] this birthright you can't
[1:36:49] help from seeing it because it's part of
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:53] and you're a part of it how could i my
[1:36:56] other mother
[1:36:56] give me birth how could i under the
[1:36:59] father that is
[1:36:59] whole blood is in me how could i deny
[1:37:02] charles brown from being my father
[1:37:04] i could not do it i'm willing to stand
[1:37:06] his reproach or anything else because
[1:37:08] i am his son amen hallelujah
[1:37:13] than being a son of god and he was the
[1:37:16] word of god
[1:37:18] how can i deny that bible being truth
[1:37:20] that jesus christ isn't to say
[1:37:22] yesterday today and forever and seeing
[1:37:24] the hour that we're living in
[1:37:26] we need our easter in the church
[1:37:31] resurrection we need a resurrection
[1:37:34] to the power of faith man and women to
[1:37:37] stand up for that
[1:37:38] which is god's vindicated word
[1:37:42] say well we have in our youth for christ
[1:37:43] that's all right our church is having a
[1:37:45] meeting
[1:37:46] we want so many members nothing against
[1:37:48] that that's all right
[1:37:50] but that's only the atmosphere
[1:37:54] that might be an old hens feathers but
[1:37:57] if you'll get in the right atmosphere
[1:37:58] there you'll hatch eagle if you're
[1:38:00] eagle egg and if you were for ordained
[1:38:02] of god to sin you gained help from
[1:38:05] seeing it
[1:38:06] you're coming forth in our resurrection
[1:38:08] praise god that's the way the baptist is
[1:38:10] born that's why the methodist is born
[1:38:12] in the resurrection that day but they
[1:38:15] turned off to a hen instead of an eagle
[1:38:18] i said not long ago going down from
[1:38:20] tucson
[1:38:21] i watched a very strange thing i've seen
[1:38:24] a hawk
[1:38:25] sitting on the wire down there that hawk
[1:38:28] has long lost his identification
[1:38:31] it used to be a bird next to the eagle
[1:38:33] he could not follow the eagle
[1:38:35] no but no means nothing can follow an
[1:38:37] eagle
[1:38:38] but he was a hawk christ is the eagle
[1:38:42] and the church should at least be a hawk
[1:38:44] they can fly higher than any other rest
[1:38:46] of birds
[1:38:47] but that hawk has become soft
[1:38:51] it's lost his identification it sits on
[1:38:54] the telephone wires and waits for
[1:38:56] some dead rabbit amen
[1:39:00] he hops like a vulture instead of flying
[1:39:02] like a hawk
[1:39:04] oh my brother sister you pentecostal
[1:39:06] people which is my own
[1:39:08] dear people the church is losing its
[1:39:11] identification
[1:39:13] it's coming down and depending on some
[1:39:15] dead formal creed
[1:39:17] instead of flying in the heavenly genre
[1:39:19] for fresh manna
[1:39:21] hawk used to hunt his own man but today
[1:39:24] he takes what the automobiles run over
[1:39:25] what the vultures eat
[1:39:28] he hops like when he looks like one we
[1:39:30] so adorned ourselves in the modern world
[1:39:34] are women cutting their hair and wearing
[1:39:36] shorts are a man with not enough
[1:39:38] backbone to stand the pulpit and tell
[1:39:39] the truth
[1:39:41] we've long got soft on the word
[1:39:44] oh god send the holy ghost to look out
[1:39:46] that eagle somewhere
[1:39:48] that's ready to stand out no matter what
[1:39:50] takes place that'll soar into the
[1:39:52] unknown
[1:39:54] not set on the telephone wires and look
[1:39:56] for some sunday school literature to
[1:39:57] come in
[1:39:58] let me have the word into the precious
[1:40:00] of the power and demonstration of the
[1:40:02] holy ghost amen
[1:40:04] we need an easter a resurrection
[1:40:08] that's potential my friend if you're
[1:40:11] satisfied with sense of caring
[1:40:13] of the world there's something wrong
[1:40:16] my sister my brother let me say to you
[1:40:19] some godly fear
[1:40:20] knowing that i may never live to sin
[1:40:21] easter again
[1:40:23] but there's one thing sure when a
[1:40:26] genuine foreign son of god
[1:40:29] by the word of god hears that voice of
[1:40:32] god he'll rise and go to me
[1:40:35] it's the potential that he's going to
[1:40:37] meet the real living word
[1:40:38] as he was the bride will meet the groom
[1:40:41] she's a part of his body notice
[1:40:45] long have we we're losing our
[1:40:47] identification
[1:40:48] we come on wednesday night some of us
[1:40:51] others stay home to watch
[1:40:52] who love susie televisions all kinds of
[1:40:55] worldly things
[1:40:56] all kinds of entertainments to keep you
[1:40:58] away from church
[1:41:00] long have we lost it our seminaries our
[1:41:03] schools are putting out a bunch of
[1:41:04] rickey's
[1:41:05] with a whole lot of theology and
[1:41:07] entertainment and
[1:41:08] everything in the church to take the
[1:41:10] place of the prayer meeting
[1:41:12] amen we've talked dressed and tried to
[1:41:14] fulfill what the modernists try to do it
[1:41:16] bring them in you will never win them
[1:41:18] but that they got more that you have
[1:41:21] you ain't got no business on your ground
[1:41:23] on their ground let them come over on
[1:41:25] yours where their real baptism is
[1:41:27] shining
[1:41:28] for the real power of the resurrection
[1:41:31] don't try to build a church like theirs
[1:41:33] don't try to have a pastor like that
[1:41:35] don't try to do this other or cooperate
[1:41:37] with the world
[1:41:38] amen they shine with hollywood
[1:41:42] the real gospel goes with power
[1:41:46] eagles hear that they don't look for a
[1:41:48] shine
[1:41:50] they look for a glow glowing with
[1:41:52] humility glowing with love
[1:41:54] glowing with power that's what the real
[1:41:56] eagle hunts
[1:41:57] you can't scratch in a barn yard and
[1:41:59] please him he'll never be able to do it
[1:42:01] you'll never touch him because he don't
[1:42:03] believe him let that voice scream from
[1:42:06] the heavens
[1:42:06] i am he that was dead and alive again
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:10] something takes place i am the same
[1:42:13] yesterday today and forever
[1:42:14] and it shall come to pass in the last
[1:42:16] days i'll pour out of myself upon all
[1:42:19] this flesh
[1:42:21] glory to god i'll quicken your immortal
[1:42:23] language i'll quick in your mortal
[1:42:25] tongues
[1:42:25] i'll give you the evidence that i'm
[1:42:27] going to bring in the resurrection with
[1:42:28] me
[1:42:30] hungry hearted eagles reach for that
[1:42:32] just as hard as i can
[1:42:33] it's a pearl of great price that they
[1:42:35] sell everything else to go by
[1:42:38] amen god help us friend
[1:42:41] our churches are losing their
[1:42:42] identification
[1:42:44] that's quickly now how to go to some
[1:42:46] watch the action of those disciples
[1:42:48] are scared they know jesus was the truth
[1:42:53] but to see it was against the popular
[1:42:54] idea amen
[1:42:56] the popular religion of the hour the
[1:42:59] most strictest religion
[1:43:01] sarah pharisees sadducees and so forth
[1:43:03] their cults clans and
[1:43:05] denominations they were they were
[1:43:07] against that heresy but jesus was the
[1:43:11] identified word
[1:43:13] and jesus is the holy ghost
[1:43:17] in spirit a little while the world sees
[1:43:20] me no more you shall see me
[1:43:21] not the body the life that was in him
[1:43:23] god
[1:43:25] is upon the church to call sons like he
[1:43:27] did that obedient
[1:43:30] i always do that which is pleasing to my
[1:43:32] father which one of you can accuse me of
[1:43:34] sin
[1:43:35] in other words sin is unbelief what has
[1:43:37] the word said about me that i haven't
[1:43:38] done
[1:43:41] show me what the word said that i do
[1:43:43] what i didn't do which one can accuse me
[1:43:45] which one can lay your fingers on me
[1:43:46] and say that i haven't fulfilled my
[1:43:48] father's word
[1:43:50] oh when the pentecostal church gets to
[1:43:52] that spot
[1:43:53] amen who can accuse me of unbelief
[1:43:57] oh christians be identified not as a
[1:44:00] hawk but an eagle
[1:44:02] that hawk is soft it'll come down you
[1:44:04] never see an eagle doing that
[1:44:05] he'll never do that he hunts his own
[1:44:07] food out of the blue
[1:44:09] god's preparing him so he can see it he
[1:44:11] gets fresh manna
[1:44:12] not something that's dead in the hebrews
[1:44:15] when he crossed through the wilderness
[1:44:16] they eat try to eat dead manna it become
[1:44:19] stagnant
[1:44:20] it had it had wiggle tails in it
[1:44:24] you know what we mean it's contaminated
[1:44:26] rotten
[1:44:27] maggots is in it why would i eat a food
[1:44:30] that had been
[1:44:31] dead years ago it might be in form and
[1:44:34] shape
[1:44:35] but it isn't fresh we got to get food
[1:44:37] every generation
[1:44:39] knew so does the eagle look for that
[1:44:42] food
[1:44:43] every generation as we're in our journey
[1:44:46] notice
[1:44:55] do you think you got all that i didn't
[1:45:00] you know and i've i've heard this many
[1:45:02] times it just
[1:45:03] it it strikes me but i uh we're just
[1:45:06] gonna take take a few moments and
[1:45:09] and i i i you know
[1:45:12] pray that um you know we just have
[1:45:15] sunday and we have
[1:45:16] church i know you have your own bible
[1:45:19] studies and your own
[1:45:20] tapes that you're listening to but it
[1:45:23] would be good as a body for us all
[1:45:25] to get behind this easter seal and
[1:45:28] study it out and read it and and and
[1:45:31] grow with it and contribute
[1:45:33] uh you know like when you're in church
[1:45:36] you're you're not just uh you're not
[1:45:39] just
[1:45:40] feeding or listening for your own lives
[1:45:42] but your spirit
[1:45:44] is contributing to everybody else
[1:45:47] and when you pull you know you have a
[1:45:49] need and the spirit works on you
[1:45:52] and and there's a pull when you pull
[1:45:55] that spirit
[1:45:56] to your life you're pulling that spirit
[1:45:58] past other people's
[1:46:00] past other minds and and things so it's
[1:46:04] all
[1:46:04] a part you know and i i'm i'm for
[1:46:07] streaming that as far as
[1:46:10] of what's happened uh
[1:46:13] with this virus and and the world and
[1:46:16] of course but it's changed everybody's
[1:46:19] viewpoint on things
[1:46:21] and it's not a substitute for church
[1:46:24] and it's not a substitute to the
[1:46:27] responsibility
[1:46:28] that you have to the body you know
[1:46:31] and that's why god places us in
[1:46:33] different places different bodies
[1:46:35] different things
[1:46:36] is not for heart convenience it's for
[1:46:39] one another
[1:46:40] because each joint supplies the other
[1:46:43] fitted and joined
[1:46:44] together you know supplying the need
[1:46:48] and so as we look through this remember
[1:46:51] that
[1:46:52] that you've got a great part
[1:46:55] that you're also playing too
[1:46:58] so as we look at this let's go we just
[1:47:02] think here for a moment
[1:47:03] and he's talking about uh
[1:47:08] and he says this here in uh paragraph
[1:47:11] uh i don't know if we read that this
[1:47:15] but he said he said here he said
[1:47:19] the spirit quickens their fellowship
[1:47:21] with god
[1:47:23] so that they call the dead back to life
[1:47:27] in that day they laid their bodies upon
[1:47:31] the dead and they come to life listen
[1:47:33] close
[1:47:35] they've done the same things that jesus
[1:47:38] did
[1:47:40] because the same spirit was upon him
[1:47:45] was upon them
[1:47:48] okay that's why they did it because so
[1:47:52] when they got the quickening spirit
[1:47:54] they didn't get a third person of the
[1:47:56] trinity
[1:47:58] they didn't get another working
[1:48:01] they got the same spirit that was in
[1:48:04] jesus
[1:48:05] was on them
[1:48:08] he didn't change their personalities
[1:48:13] you understand didn't change if i could
[1:48:16] say when i say
[1:48:17] personality that's your nature the
[1:48:19] things that you like
[1:48:21] and dislike but it was the same
[1:48:24] spirit on them and and
[1:48:27] each person did as they were led
[1:48:31] to do the footsteps of the righteous
[1:48:34] are ordered by the lord so we're not
[1:48:37] looking back
[1:48:38] at pentecost and saying oh they did this
[1:48:41] they did this they did that
[1:48:43] i had to go i have to go out and do this
[1:48:46] and do this and do this
[1:48:47] no all you have to do because you have
[1:48:50] he gives you that spirit you want it
[1:48:54] he gives you spirit now he orders your
[1:48:58] footsteps i i remember
[1:49:01] uh years ago and and when i was living
[1:49:04] in flagstaff and brother floyd patterson
[1:49:06] was the pastor at that time
[1:49:07] he was telling the story how he was just
[1:49:10] praying
[1:49:11] for god to really uh
[1:49:16] you know give him a great work to do and
[1:49:18] he wanted his ministry anointed and
[1:49:21] and he told the story and and so he got
[1:49:24] a phone call from an
[1:49:26] elderly couple that uh
[1:49:29] needed some help and he raised up you
[1:49:32] know he has
[1:49:33] felt anointed and powerful and been in
[1:49:36] prayer and fasting
[1:49:37] and he got over there and what they
[1:49:41] wanted was from him that he would help
[1:49:44] them
[1:49:46] zip up a zipper on a sleeping bag so
[1:49:49] they could roll it up
[1:49:51] and ship it to their son or or something
[1:49:55] and you want to know something doing
[1:49:58] that in the obedience of god
[1:50:00] would be greater than doing any other
[1:50:03] work outside the will of god
[1:50:05] that's right so we the
[1:50:08] and the point of this is there's got to
[1:50:10] be that
[1:50:12] personal relationship with
[1:50:15] that quickening power so if you
[1:50:17] understand
[1:50:18] it's a spirit it's his spirit
[1:50:22] the same spirit comes down and makes
[1:50:25] contact with your life and you accept
[1:50:30] that spirit in you
[1:50:31] to be now what leads you
[1:50:36] right so it leads you now that spirit's
[1:50:39] in you leading you so
[1:50:43] how how does that leadership
[1:50:46] work and i think that's a lot of
[1:50:49] questions people
[1:50:50] want to know how how am i led to the
[1:50:52] lord but
[1:50:53] it's laying right here in such a
[1:50:56] beautiful way
[1:50:58] he says he said
[1:51:01] it quickened the same spirit was upon
[1:51:05] them
[1:51:05] if one spirit makes a man act this way
[1:51:08] it makes the other one act that way
[1:51:10] how can this come upon
[1:51:13] how can this come upon say he's got the
[1:51:16] spirit of god
[1:51:18] and deny the works of adi can't do it
[1:51:20] now listen
[1:51:22] god's life which is in the greek
[1:51:25] zoe moving through them
[1:51:29] and in them quickened their
[1:51:33] minds to his
[1:51:36] word
[1:51:40] so now now you see it's not you looking
[1:51:43] out and seeing a
[1:51:47] event and then trying to go reproduce it
[1:51:54] that's where pentecost failed
[1:51:59] they they got the restoration and they
[1:52:02] went back and they tried to duplicate it
[1:52:04] they tried to duplicate it
[1:52:06] and it never worked he said it don't
[1:52:08] work
[1:52:10] you can't even win them on that ground
[1:52:12] but he said he quickens your mind
[1:52:16] the spirit of god quickens your mind
[1:52:19] it gives you an unction it speaks to you
[1:52:23] in your mind and then when you recognize
[1:52:27] it as being the spirit
[1:52:28] you recognize it as being what the word
[1:52:31] of god
[1:52:32] it drops from your mind into your heart
[1:52:36] and becomes the will of god
[1:52:41] but it's going to come to you where
[1:52:43] first
[1:52:45] it's going to come to you in your mind
[1:52:47] because
[1:52:48] a word is a what thought expressed
[1:52:52] so he's going to give it to your mind
[1:52:56] can you recognize it as being the word
[1:52:59] and then that word that's in your mind
[1:53:02] the thought becomes expressed and then
[1:53:06] it's the word
[1:53:07] of god expressed in you so
[1:53:10] that's how you're led it's not you
[1:53:13] studying the bible
[1:53:15] okay and no study the bible
[1:53:19] because that's where it'll come and
[1:53:21] quicken your mind
[1:53:23] but if the thought gets quicker than you
[1:53:25] the unction of the spirit
[1:53:27] quickens in your mind you see it's the
[1:53:29] word of god you believe it
[1:53:31] it drops into your heart and then it
[1:53:33] becomes the thought that was in you
[1:53:38] manifested that's why satan is always
[1:53:41] trying to put thoughts in your mind
[1:53:43] that you manifest them thoughts instead
[1:53:46] of
[1:53:46] god's thoughts but god gave you the best
[1:53:49] weapon that he could give you and that
[1:53:51] was the word of god
[1:53:52] where's the battleground the
[1:53:54] battlegrounds in your mind
[1:53:56] so the word of god is put in your mind
[1:53:59] the spirit
[1:54:00] comes and quickens that work
[1:54:03] in your mind quickens your mind you
[1:54:06] accept that word
[1:54:08] and then you bring that thought into
[1:54:11] expression
[1:54:14] and then you become the word
[1:54:18] and that's where the battle is
[1:54:22] you believe that then i like this
[1:54:25] he says it quickens it quickens their
[1:54:29] mind
[1:54:29] to his word now let me say this
[1:54:33] real quietly now
[1:54:40] i like that statement in other words
[1:54:44] take a deep breath listen
[1:54:52] let me say it real quietly now the
[1:54:54] spirit of god
[1:54:57] that moves among the people
[1:55:01] quickens the mind of the person
[1:55:05] to the promise of god
[1:55:14] it does it look
[1:55:18] i'm trying to show you
[1:55:21] and let you realize that i'm speaking
[1:55:24] now
[1:55:24] of the church and also quickened
[1:55:29] to life in him
[1:55:32] what a statement
[1:55:36] you know it's it's it's
[1:55:39] that outside force quickening to your
[1:55:43] mind
[1:55:43] the word of god you recognizing that's
[1:55:47] the word
[1:55:48] some other thing comes in there it don't
[1:55:50] filter to the word
[1:55:51] then then you you don't do it you go
[1:55:53] back in the spirit
[1:55:54] it quickens the word how many thoughts
[1:55:57] do you have
[1:55:58] but the spirit has never been there to
[1:56:00] quicken it
[1:56:01] it's not his thought he don't quicken
[1:56:04] he only quickens his word so you have
[1:56:08] that's a process that we've got to
[1:56:11] become aware of
[1:56:12] if we're going to go on because we can't
[1:56:15] clone
[1:56:20] you understand what i'm saying it's an
[1:56:22] individual
[1:56:23] affair and many times in your life
[1:56:27] you have to lay down what you desire to
[1:56:30] do
[1:56:31] and what you want to do and be obedient
[1:56:35] to god's word
[1:56:36] regardless
[1:56:39] to my own personal testimony very on
[1:56:43] early in my life i was a lover of the
[1:56:45] ocean
[1:56:46] i love to fish i love yachts and boats
[1:56:51] and i i had a a a
[1:56:54] a job i was working on a boat
[1:56:57] and i came to the knowledge of this
[1:57:00] message and the revelation that i
[1:57:04] should leave california
[1:57:08] that same weekend i i heard the tape on
[1:57:12] the
[1:57:13] saturday and and you know
[1:57:16] the story of it and then i remember we
[1:57:18] finally had come
[1:57:20] along and made up our mind we were
[1:57:22] moving out of california
[1:57:24] and i did a phone call from tom beach
[1:57:28] and he says david i want you to come
[1:57:31] work on the yacht
[1:57:33] we got some things out we're going to
[1:57:35] take the president of mexico out
[1:57:38] and we're going to take josh cousteau
[1:57:40] and some of his
[1:57:41] people out this is like oh my god this
[1:57:44] is what i prayed for all my life
[1:57:47] this is what i wanted i always wanted
[1:57:50] that
[1:57:51] just think of it i just pictured myself
[1:57:54] with
[1:57:55] leathery skin you know what i mean not
[1:57:58] old wrinkle skin i mean dark
[1:58:00] leather skin you know just out and
[1:58:02] walking down the rail of the boat you
[1:58:04] know what i mean
[1:58:06] and oh i just you can't imagine i was in
[1:58:08] heaven
[1:58:09] and i remember standing in my front yard
[1:58:12] and i thought lord
[1:58:16] i'm gonna pour this out to you like
[1:58:18] david
[1:58:20] poured out his offering
[1:58:23] i was going to give up my heart's desire
[1:58:27] and you know what i did when i poured it
[1:58:29] out to him
[1:58:30] and then all of a sudden i rejoiced and
[1:58:32] i think i maybe even danced like david
[1:58:34] dance i was doing the irish jig right
[1:58:36] out in the front yard
[1:58:38] why because he gave me my heart's
[1:58:42] desire
[1:58:47] and that's what he did to david david
[1:58:49] desired a drink
[1:58:51] from that fountain lord let me have a
[1:58:54] drink
[1:58:54] from that fountain and here comes the
[1:58:56] opportunity here comes the desire of my
[1:58:59] heart
[1:58:59] everything that i ever wanted every
[1:59:01] vision
[1:59:02] i ever thought i'll walk in that elite
[1:59:05] and here i'm just going to jump in a bus
[1:59:07] with a bunch of hippies and drive to
[1:59:09] montana
[1:59:13] but you know something i was glad i
[1:59:17] poured out that water
[1:59:19] and i was glad he gave me the desire of
[1:59:21] my heart i was willing to make the
[1:59:23] sacrifice because i knew
[1:59:25] that i heard the voice then i wasn't
[1:59:29] going to
[1:59:30] follow and that's the thing where's that
[1:59:32] voice going to come to
[1:59:34] it's going to come to that mind and
[1:59:37] that's where that spirit works is right
[1:59:39] on the battleground
[1:59:40] quickening that word what's he do he
[1:59:43] quickens the
[1:59:44] mind to the word
[1:59:47] oh i wish that i had the vocabulary i
[1:59:50] wish i had the spirit
[1:59:52] to express that to you and here's the
[1:59:55] prophet of god
[1:59:56] preaching to these people and he knows
[1:59:58] the spirit
[2:00:00] is quickening their minds to the
[2:00:03] fulfillment
[2:00:04] of the promised word
[2:00:08] right so he knows that
[2:00:12] so as we look at this and and and we
[2:00:16] we we we read that so we we see that he
[2:00:19] comes back over here
[2:00:21] and he says he he quickens their minds
[2:00:24] let me say that real slow
[2:00:26] he says i'm speaking of the church
[2:00:29] quickened to life i'm speaking of the
[2:00:33] church
[2:00:33] being quickened to life this is how it
[2:00:36] happens
[2:00:38] right and then he talks about john doe
[2:00:40] and he talks about
[2:00:41] what he goes through and and so we we
[2:00:44] see that
[2:00:44] that great beautiful thing that he
[2:00:47] quickens
[2:00:48] to the mind and so after that he brings
[2:00:51] that forth
[2:00:52] he breaks into this little thing and
[2:00:55] and i think it's uh i i think it's
[2:00:59] noteworthy if if i could say this it
[2:01:03] says
[2:01:04] in paragraph 31 he says now there's a
[2:01:06] mockery of it
[2:01:09] and there's a lot of people that really
[2:01:11] think they got it
[2:01:13] when they haven't a lot of people
[2:01:16] do it because they have some false
[2:01:19] impression of what they've seen
[2:01:23] other christians do young people
[2:01:27] please i know you go to a lot of
[2:01:30] meetings
[2:01:31] and i know you've got a lot of places
[2:01:33] but don't
[2:01:34] ever rely on what other people
[2:01:37] are doing you
[2:01:41] wait till it's quickened to your mind
[2:01:46] that way it's your mind is the only
[2:01:50] thing
[2:01:51] that makes it personal
[2:01:54] you understand what i'm saying it's the
[2:01:56] only thing that makes it personal
[2:01:59] you can't look out and say this person's
[2:02:01] doing this
[2:02:02] this person's doing that everybody's
[2:02:04] doing this
[2:02:05] everybody's that i'll tell you something
[2:02:07] you can sit there just as still
[2:02:10] as a stone on the beach
[2:02:14] and if god's talking to your mind
[2:02:18] and you know it's him and he's telling
[2:02:21] you go make this right you go do that
[2:02:23] right
[2:02:24] you can do this you know you can
[2:02:27] overcome this
[2:02:29] and you know it's him and that touches
[2:02:32] your mind
[2:02:33] and drops into your heart you've had
[2:02:35] just as much
[2:02:36] experience with god as anybody
[2:02:41] now here's the prophet of god pointing
[2:02:43] out an heir
[2:02:48] a common heir
[2:02:51] in the church and that's
[2:02:54] the scriptures even says you become
[2:02:57] fools comparing yourselves
[2:02:59] one with another don't do it you be that
[2:03:03] individual christian
[2:03:04] you serve god because it's in your heart
[2:03:06] to serve god god's talking to your mind
[2:03:09] he's quickening the word to you you're
[2:03:12] following that word you're obedient
[2:03:14] to that word and that's your personal
[2:03:16] relationship
[2:03:21] he says what others do satan can
[2:03:23] impersonate any of that
[2:03:25] we know that as missionaries we've seen
[2:03:29] all these great uh things that
[2:03:33] that go on so we we've got to understand
[2:03:36] that he says
[2:03:37] and he says but you can see it
[2:03:39] impersonated
[2:03:40] anywhere absolutely
[2:03:44] amongst heathens who that deny that
[2:03:47] there's such a thing of jesus christ
[2:03:50] so we're not talking so there's got to
[2:03:52] be some way that the spirit of god works
[2:03:55] in you
[2:03:58] you understand that and that mind
[2:04:01] that you have that that spirit's
[2:04:04] quickening to the word of god
[2:04:07] is what makes it personal
[2:04:10] and let me tell you that's the hardest
[2:04:12] part of being a christian
[2:04:13] because you have your desires you have
[2:04:16] what you want to do
[2:04:17] you have what where where the you would
[2:04:20] like to do it you're creating your own
[2:04:22] leadership
[2:04:22] your own pathway and yet that voice is
[2:04:25] telling in you don't do it
[2:04:33] and and if we're not careful we learn
[2:04:37] to override that
[2:04:42] we get so beat down
[2:04:45] and the ministry sometimes is the
[2:04:47] biggest beater of the people
[2:04:51] but we get so beat down we don't even
[2:04:53] have confidence in god talking to our
[2:04:56] our thoughts
[2:05:02] i've watched it in my life i've watched
[2:05:05] it in my life
[2:05:06] how many times in my
[2:05:09] mind i know
[2:05:13] that it's god amen
[2:05:17] and i i i go to read other quotes
[2:05:24] i go find a different sermon
[2:05:30] you know go find some greener grass
[2:05:34] whatever no am i lost
[2:05:37] no did i take the permissive will
[2:05:42] sure but the permissive will always
[2:05:46] leads back to the perfect will
[2:05:51] and it's presented there again
[2:05:57] you couldn't draw a more perfect picture
[2:06:01] have confidence
[2:06:05] so let's read this just we're just going
[2:06:07] through here
[2:06:08] he said and this is paragraph
[2:06:14] 34.
[2:06:17] he says let's notice pentecost
[2:06:21] how they acted and see if they were
[2:06:24] quickened
[2:06:25] by the quickening power that we're
[2:06:28] talking about
[2:06:29] now he's that he's going to come up with
[2:06:32] a completely different evidence here
[2:06:36] and if you just bear with me for a
[2:06:37] moment this morning
[2:06:40] if they are quickened by this quickening
[2:06:42] power talked about
[2:06:44] on the day of pentecost they were all
[2:06:46] waiting up there
[2:06:47] in themselves they were
[2:06:50] afraid so you know we have all the
[2:06:54] evidence
[2:06:55] of oh they did this and they went and
[2:06:57] did this and they went and said that
[2:06:59] no the first evidence of the quickening
[2:07:03] power
[2:07:04] was that it took away the
[2:07:07] fear
[2:07:10] number one that was the evidence
[2:07:14] of pentecost look and see
[2:07:17] if they had the quickening power
[2:07:20] that we're talking about looking out
[2:07:22] there in
[2:07:23] themselves they were afraid
[2:07:27] now they were still afraid and they had
[2:07:32] revelation i mean look at how beautiful
[2:07:37] am i okay okay
[2:07:41] he said and they were afraid the jews
[2:07:45] just what they were going to do so they
[2:07:48] got scared
[2:07:50] but what happened when this
[2:07:53] quickening power fell from heaven
[2:07:57] there was a bravery
[2:08:00] set upon them oh
[2:08:03] there's a little different teaching on
[2:08:06] the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:08:08] not my teaching you understand there's a
[2:08:11] little
[2:08:12] something different that brother branham
[2:08:13] is telling him all sitting there
[2:08:16] looking at him and afraid to recognize
[2:08:20] that
[2:08:20] let me tell you something all these
[2:08:22] people that you see on the internet
[2:08:25] everybody out there all the television
[2:08:27] evangelists and everybody
[2:08:28] is talking about brother random now
[2:08:32] oh he had the resident gift he
[2:08:35] prophesied these events
[2:08:37] they failed to recognize what
[2:08:40] brother branham's ministry was it was a
[2:08:43] fulfillment
[2:08:44] of a promised scriptural
[2:08:48] prophecy and that's what they don't
[2:08:50] recognize
[2:08:51] they don't recognize his ministry
[2:08:54] fulfilled
[2:08:55] revelations 10 7. his ministry
[2:08:59] fulfilled luke 17 30. his ministry
[2:09:03] was the ministry of malachi 4 5.
[2:09:06] talk about his works oh yeah talk about
[2:09:09] this
[2:09:10] when it comes down this message is not
[2:09:12] about the works of brother branham
[2:09:14] it's about the fulfillment of god's
[2:09:17] promised word
[2:09:19] to this age that god
[2:09:22] would come down in this age and veil
[2:09:26] himself
[2:09:26] in human flesh reinpersoning the same
[2:09:30] works that he did
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:36] and and that's it exactly
[2:09:40] uh what he said that's why he said here
[2:09:44] he said look god had the same when it's
[2:09:47] paragraph 127
[2:09:49] when he saw jesus it was the finished
[2:09:52] work
[2:09:53] that god finished with jesus when he
[2:09:56] said
[2:09:56] it's finished all the plan is finished
[2:09:59] why was it all
[2:10:00] finished in jesus because he was going
[2:10:04] to send
[2:10:06] the quickening spirit the first adam was
[2:10:10] a what
[2:10:12] the second adam was a quickening
[2:10:16] spirit
[2:10:20] that's jesus christ living in you that's
[2:10:23] jesus christ the same yesterday together
[2:10:26] that's the one we serve that's the one
[2:10:28] we worship
[2:10:29] the one that's quickening the word to
[2:10:32] your mind
[2:10:33] you might as well try stop serving
[2:10:36] william branham in history
[2:10:39] everything brother branham said is alive
[2:10:42] today
[2:10:43] a hundred percent vindicated by god
[2:10:46] it's just coming off tape in the flesh
[2:10:56] that spirit's here quickening
[2:11:02] it's personal i don't care you say i
[2:11:06] ain't felt no quickening you know what
[2:11:07] you do
[2:11:08] pray for quickening pray for what
[2:11:13] revelation pray for revelation god give
[2:11:16] me
[2:11:17] a revelation
[2:11:22] but look at this evidence
[2:11:25] because i want you to take this back to
[2:11:27] yourself
[2:11:29] listen listen just real closely
[2:11:32] he said
[2:11:36] at bravery said upon there was something
[2:11:38] before
[2:11:39] they knowed he had died
[2:11:43] they knowed he had risen
[2:11:48] they talked to him on the way but there
[2:11:51] was that thing
[2:11:54] for them or it was just for them
[2:11:57] or for jesus himself
[2:12:01] how many ever go through that is it for
[2:12:05] me
[2:12:08] or just so we don't want to walk with it
[2:12:11] as the truth
[2:12:13] please let me get through this and and
[2:12:16] then
[2:12:18] we'll have a short evening service
[2:12:21] but there on the day of pentecost the
[2:12:23] holy spirit the abstract
[2:12:25] fell upon the believers that made them a
[2:12:27] part of his resurrection
[2:12:29] made him part of his fellowship the holy
[2:12:33] spirit came and
[2:12:34] confirmed to them that they would be
[2:12:36] raised up
[2:12:39] because they were potentially raised up
[2:12:42] from cowards to brave men
[2:12:47] they were they were afraid
[2:12:50] of the very word
[2:12:53] that they had thought
[2:13:02] see that quickening of that mind they
[2:13:04] were afraid
[2:13:05] of the very word that they thought how
[2:13:08] many of us
[2:13:09] get thoughts maybe to do a good work
[2:13:13] maybe to pray for somebody and we were
[2:13:16] afraid
[2:13:17] of our very thought
[2:13:24] can you imagine overcoming that
[2:13:27] let me tell you the quickening spirit is
[2:13:30] here
[2:13:32] to overcome that
[2:13:36] the spirit's here he's going to work
[2:13:39] with your
[2:13:40] mind he's going to build that bravery
[2:13:43] into those thoughts that you carry out
[2:13:46] them
[2:13:46] thoughts
[2:13:49] anyway he said that
[2:13:53] he said they were afraid of the very
[2:13:55] word that they had thought
[2:13:57] don't let this pass over
[2:14:00] you can i say that this morning
[2:14:05] don't let this pass over you
[2:14:14] what's the attribute of faith
[2:14:19] love what's the attribute
[2:14:23] of doubt fear
[2:14:30] there's two spirits that rule the church
[2:14:33] you understand i i've got to preach what
[2:14:36] the prophet says
[2:14:37] i can't preach with you desire to hear
[2:14:41] if he brings you under conviction i'm
[2:14:43] not bringing you under conviction
[2:14:45] i don't know it there's some things i
[2:14:47] see there's some things i know
[2:14:49] but i'll tell you how you can tell
[2:14:50] whether it's the holy spirit
[2:14:52] or not when you see something is how it
[2:14:54] makes you feel to that person
[2:14:58] it's the attitude you take for them
[2:15:01] and if you love them you'll never quit
[2:15:03] loving them
[2:15:04] you'll never stop being their friend
[2:15:06] you'll never stop
[2:15:08] being you know their brother or
[2:15:12] that's just the way it is
[2:15:16] as i said they
[2:15:19] they are afraid of the very word that
[2:15:20] they thought
[2:15:22] they know that he was the word even the
[2:15:25] jews had admitted it
[2:15:27] nicodemus rabbi we know you're one of
[2:15:29] the masters
[2:15:30] he says here but now there in the upper
[2:15:33] room
[2:15:33] paragraph 40 in the presence of god they
[2:15:37] all of a sudden here come the spirit
[2:15:40] down from heaven
[2:15:41] and it quickened them and it the
[2:15:44] quickening
[2:15:45] took place they wasn't afraid
[2:15:48] to make a witness of the message
[2:15:52] that they believed and knowed to be true
[2:15:56] now what was the evidence
[2:15:59] that the fear wasn't there that they
[2:16:02] weren't afraid
[2:16:04] to make a witness
[2:16:07] now if god's looking down upon us as
[2:16:10] believers
[2:16:13] and paul the very first thing he says to
[2:16:15] the romans
[2:16:16] i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus
[2:16:18] christ
[2:16:19] because it's the power of god the
[2:16:21] salvation
[2:16:22] then the messenger even talking to these
[2:16:24] full gospel businessmen
[2:16:26] he's telling them you're afraid
[2:16:31] you're afraid that this ministry that's
[2:16:34] the revealed word of god
[2:16:35] you're afraid to stand for it you're
[2:16:37] afraid to testify of it
[2:16:40] you're afraid but let me tell you he
[2:16:43] says
[2:16:43] what the evidence was that they got the
[2:16:46] holy spirit wasn't that they spoke in
[2:16:49] tongues
[2:16:49] it wasn't they had a youth council was
[2:16:52] it that they had this what
[2:16:53] the evidence was is that they weren't
[2:16:56] afraid
[2:16:57] to witness to the message
[2:17:03] i think we really ought to ask ourselves
[2:17:05] how many people have we sat down across
[2:17:06] the table
[2:17:07] and really explained business associates
[2:17:10] people
[2:17:12] have we won to the lord
[2:17:16] well you don't win anybody to the lord
[2:17:19] he wins them
[2:17:20] you're just a carrier of the good news
[2:17:23] to them
[2:17:26] how many people have we not failed to
[2:17:28] talk how many times that he spoke to our
[2:17:30] mind
[2:17:31] and we felt that unction
[2:17:34] but that fear
[2:17:40] stops us because we're talking about a
[2:17:44] church
[2:17:45] that we want to see the power of god the
[2:17:47] works
[2:17:48] followed the dismissal of the fear
[2:17:54] when the fear left the works came
[2:17:59] they already had the revelation they
[2:18:01] knew he raised from the dead
[2:18:03] they knew he was the word they knew all
[2:18:05] those things
[2:18:07] you understand that but the fear still
[2:18:10] kept them in bondage
[2:18:11] and it wasn't until that spirit
[2:18:13] quickened in them
[2:18:14] in their mind can quickened it to them
[2:18:18] that they weren't afraid and after they
[2:18:20] weren't afraid
[2:18:21] that's when the signs followed
[2:18:25] if not you're just going to get church
[2:18:28] meeting signs
[2:18:31] signs amongst believers
[2:18:34] we don't need signs amongst believers we
[2:18:36] need signs
[2:18:37] to the unbeliever
[2:18:44] maybe i've gone crazy
[2:18:51] that's a lovely song
[2:18:57] thank you for that then all of a sudden
[2:19:00] here come the holy spirit down
[2:19:01] heaven and quicken them and that
[2:19:04] quickening took place
[2:19:05] they wasn't afraid to make witness of
[2:19:07] the message that they believed
[2:19:10] and knowed to be true they weren't
[2:19:13] afraid to make a witness of the message
[2:19:16] that they believed and knew was true
[2:19:19] they already
[2:19:20] believed it and they already made that
[2:19:22] was true
[2:19:23] the difference now god is measuring this
[2:19:26] age by the quickening power for this
[2:19:29] age so if he's looking out and it does
[2:19:32] the same thing on every
[2:19:34] believer if we got what they got
[2:19:37] in the beginning then they weren't
[2:19:40] ashamed
[2:19:41] of the promised word that came to pass
[2:19:45] if we got that same spirit then we're
[2:19:48] not
[2:19:48] afraid of the promised word that's come
[2:19:50] to pass in our day
[2:19:54] we're not ashamed of it but you want to
[2:19:57] notice
[2:19:59] what is the whole world doing now
[2:20:03] it's making us more difficult not to be
[2:20:06] ashamed
[2:20:07] we can't preach against homosexuality we
[2:20:10] can't preach against this
[2:20:12] we can't preach against that they're
[2:20:14] trying to bring all kinds of things that
[2:20:16] have nothing to do with christianity
[2:20:18] christianity don't hate their brother
[2:20:22] they're not involved in political
[2:20:24] warfare
[2:20:27] they don't weaponize the creation of god
[2:20:32] did you hear me say that they don't
[2:20:35] weaponize
[2:20:36] the creation of god god made you the way
[2:20:39] he made you because he
[2:20:40] loves you the way you are he or his he
[2:20:43] speaks to
[2:20:44] your mind it's a personal affair god
[2:20:47] does not deal with groups
[2:20:52] so anytime you see a great big group
[2:20:55] movement you might as well put your
[2:20:56] finger on it it
[2:20:58] ain't god
[2:21:06] it's you it's you and him
[2:21:10] it's personal it's individual there's a
[2:21:14] whole
[2:21:15] quickening storehouse here just for you
[2:21:18] sister just for you to feed on just for
[2:21:21] you to eat
[2:21:22] just for him to talk to you you've got
[2:21:25] your leadership right here
[2:21:31] lord quicken my mind
[2:21:35] he's the conductor he fits the body
[2:21:39] i want to be wherever he wants to place
[2:21:42] me in the body
[2:21:43] i wished it was california i wished it
[2:21:46] was
[2:21:47] but i had to take my journey to get to
[2:21:49] where god wanted me
[2:21:54] don't you want to be where he wants you
[2:21:56] where you can contribute where you can
[2:21:58] be a part
[2:21:59] of what he's doing you know praise god
[2:22:03] no that's personal
[2:22:08] if you ask me about something all i can
[2:22:10] tell you is you if
[2:22:11] they have a church do they have a pastor
[2:22:15] then my answer as long as you've got a
[2:22:17] church as long as you be in service
[2:22:21] but i don't give the answer
[2:22:25] he gives the answer and let me tell you
[2:22:27] if you're a christian you're going to
[2:22:29] come across a lot of instances in life
[2:22:31] where you don't like his answer
[2:22:34] but you're always better when you take
[2:22:36] it
[2:22:37] all right let's close up this morning i
[2:22:38] don't even know what time i got i got
[2:22:40] carried away i am carried away
[2:22:42] i'm out of my mind i just wanted to
[2:22:44] touch on this
[2:22:46] this we talked on that thing i want to
[2:22:48] just make that
[2:22:49] thing so clear about this
[2:22:53] you know that and he makes a comment
[2:22:56] he's
[2:22:58] and see if i can find
[2:23:01] that remark and
[2:23:04] i guess i don't have it marked but he
[2:23:07] talked about the hand
[2:23:08] feathers
[2:23:14] do you remember where that was where he
[2:23:16] just talked about he said you could
[2:23:18] watch the
[2:23:20] what 147 so
[2:23:23] let's read 143 we'll read 147 and then
[2:23:26] we'll just
[2:23:27] uh wait for another day he said
[2:23:31] i put down here in my note on one
[2:23:34] uh uh
[2:23:37] uh 43 he says
[2:23:40] this i i i mark this down i call it
[2:23:44] the challenge you know he says
[2:23:47] i wonder today where we're at
[2:23:50] i ask you where is
[2:23:53] this resurrecting resurrection
[2:23:57] finding us
[2:24:00] are you dare to step out
[2:24:04] are you dare to take god at his word
[2:24:08] if you're ordained to life you
[2:24:12] sure will do it if you're
[2:24:15] an eagle you can't help doing it
[2:24:19] there is something in you
[2:24:22] or do you want just to serve a creed
[2:24:26] somewhere or say i go to church
[2:24:33] you see the difference between doing the
[2:24:35] will of god
[2:24:36] and going to church
[2:24:40] think about that a little bit or do i
[2:24:42] just want to say
[2:24:44] i've covered it i'm going to church
[2:24:48] as long as i'm going to church i've got
[2:24:51] it covered
[2:24:52] i can do anything i want to do
[2:24:56] don't you want to grow
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:59] i can do anything i wanted as long as i
[2:25:01] was
[2:25:03] go to church hallelujah
[2:25:07] have we all got to the place that we
[2:25:10] just go to church
[2:25:15] i'm in how do you know i am i go to
[2:25:22] church
[2:25:26] that's that's just
[2:25:30] that that's just something a christian
[2:25:32] wants to do
[2:25:35] it ain't a fulfillment
[2:25:41] so what's he supposed to quicken
[2:25:44] our minds so we have to bring up these
[2:25:47] things
[2:25:48] so he says or do we just go or do we
[2:25:51] just say i
[2:25:52] i just want to say i go to church
[2:25:57] he said
[2:26:01] i i go to church i'm just as good
[2:26:04] as you are see if you
[2:26:08] hold no birthright
[2:26:12] you'll never see it you can't see it
[2:26:16] but if you do hold the possession
[2:26:20] of the birthright you can't help
[2:26:23] from seeing it because it's a part
[2:26:26] of you and you're a part of it
[2:26:30] now i'm not talking about the message
[2:26:32] and he's not talking about the message
[2:26:34] what he's saying that you can't miss is
[2:26:37] the quickening
[2:26:38] of god's word to your mind if you're a
[2:26:42] part of it
[2:26:43] you see exactly what god's saying to you
[2:26:48] you can't help but see it now it's up to
[2:26:51] you how you act on it
[2:26:55] that's right are we lost no
[2:26:59] i just don't want to live in the
[2:27:00] permissive will of god all my life
[2:27:05] and if you say well how much of your
[2:27:06] life have you lived in the permissive
[2:27:08] will brother david
[2:27:09] probably 85 percent of it
[2:27:12] maybe i'm given too much credit
[2:27:15] to myself
[2:27:18] but we've got to recognize the hour and
[2:27:21] start taking it serious
[2:27:25] and then this is what he says down in
[2:27:26] paragraph
[2:27:28] corey says well you say we have our
[2:27:32] youth for christ so you see how these
[2:27:35] things are falling together
[2:27:36] that's all right our church is having a
[2:27:39] meeting
[2:27:39] we want so many members nothing against
[2:27:42] that
[2:27:43] but that's only the atmosphere
[2:27:47] that might be old hens feathers
[2:27:51] but if you'll get in the right
[2:27:53] atmosphere
[2:27:54] it'll hatch out eagle if you're an eagle
[2:27:57] egg if you're ordained of god
[2:28:01] to see it you can't help from seeing it
[2:28:04] you're coming forth in a resurrection
[2:28:08] that's the way the baptist was born
[2:28:13] do you understand that's how they were
[2:28:14] born
[2:28:17] they got in the atmosphere the right
[2:28:21] atmosphere luther
[2:28:24] came out with the word the word was
[2:28:27] quick into their mind
[2:28:29] and they said i got to get away from
[2:28:30] this lighting candles to saints
[2:28:33] i've got to get away from this
[2:28:34] confessing of sins i've got to get away
[2:28:37] from that
[2:28:38] it was quickened because they got in the
[2:28:40] atmosphere
[2:28:43] of what luther was preaching
[2:28:47] in justification he says that's how the
[2:28:50] baptists were born
[2:28:52] okay you know that's how the methodist
[2:28:54] was born
[2:28:55] in resurrection of that day
[2:28:59] so there's a resurrection of this day
[2:29:02] the quickening
[2:29:03] of this day but they turned off to a
[2:29:06] hand
[2:29:07] instead of an eagle now
[2:29:10] and i'll close with this this morning
[2:29:15] we listen to tapes
[2:29:18] but there's an atmosphere that goes with
[2:29:21] the tapes
[2:29:23] the prophet of god said the anointing is
[2:29:26] on the tapes
[2:29:29] you can hatch a a
[2:29:33] chicken under a puppy
[2:29:37] okay so you can
[2:29:40] you can uh listen to the word
[2:29:44] you can listen to music well there's a
[2:29:48] on i wish i could just express this to
[2:29:51] you
[2:29:52] there is an atmosphere that
[2:29:55] goes with each tape
[2:30:01] so i don't want to sit outside
[2:30:04] of the atmosphere and be listening to
[2:30:07] the tape
[2:30:08] in the atmosphere that i'm in
[2:30:14] now many a times i would be on the front
[2:30:16] of my boat
[2:30:17] fishing and playing a tape
[2:30:22] because i love to hear the voice i love
[2:30:24] it i wasn't
[2:30:25] in the atmosphere of the tape
[2:30:32] to me the message in the bible are
[2:30:36] equal amen
[2:30:42] you know what i'm saying because the
[2:30:46] i read the bible but i only had my own
[2:30:50] thought until the spirit came
[2:30:53] and quickened the word my mind and then
[2:30:56] i saw what the bible was saying
[2:30:59] the letter killeth but the spirit
[2:31:03] gives life amen
[2:31:06] and so i i i'm fishing and and i'm
[2:31:09] listening and everything but when i got
[2:31:11] a
[2:31:11] hook you know what i mean
[2:31:17] you know what i mean now i'm in the
[2:31:19] atmosphere of that fish
[2:31:24] you know it's a big one that has a dink
[2:31:27] you know throw it back in the water okay
[2:31:29] and i'm saying that
[2:31:31] you can listen to tapes at work that's
[2:31:33] good
[2:31:34] i'm not talking about that that's good
[2:31:38] it's better than listening to elvis
[2:31:40] presley
[2:31:42] but there's a different experience
[2:31:46] when you sit down and you come
[2:31:49] into the atmosphere of that tape
[2:31:53] the atmosphere lord quicken
[2:31:57] something from me i so i'm not listening
[2:32:01] to what i already know
[2:32:06] i'm i'm not being re-vindicated
[2:32:10] i'm not looking for more fortification
[2:32:14] for the thoughts that i already have i'm
[2:32:16] not looking for sermon material
[2:32:21] i'm coming into an atmosphere
[2:32:25] because i'm looking for something to
[2:32:28] hatch
[2:32:32] something being quickened in me
[2:32:36] more something that
[2:32:39] is being enkindled by by the
[2:32:43] atmosphere and and let me just
[2:32:46] express that thought in the reading of
[2:32:49] these next few
[2:32:50] statements and
[2:32:54] he he talked about the identity
[2:32:58] about the church so let's just read this
[2:33:01] and i'll close i should be out by
[2:33:03] one o'clock and you'll all be hungry so
[2:33:07] you'll really enjoy your lunch
[2:33:11] christ is an eagle remember he just
[2:33:14] talked about that
[2:33:15] lost his identity and the church
[2:33:18] should at least be a hawk they could fly
[2:33:22] higher than any other rest of the birds
[2:33:25] but that hawk has become soft
[2:33:28] it's lost its identification now let's
[2:33:31] see what the identification
[2:33:33] is he
[2:33:36] sets on the telephone wire and waits for
[2:33:40] some
[2:33:40] dead rabbit he hops like a vulture
[2:33:45] instead of flying like a hawk
[2:33:49] oh my brother sister you pentecostal
[2:33:52] people which is my
[2:33:53] own dear people the church
[2:33:57] is losing its identification
[2:34:01] it's coming down and depending
[2:34:04] on some dead formal creed
[2:34:08] instead of flying
[2:34:12] in the heavenlies yonder for fresh manna
[2:34:20] where's that fresh manna it's in that
[2:34:23] atmosphere
[2:34:25] that's what atmosphere is the heavenly
[2:34:28] it doesn't go
[2:34:29] into the heavenlies to get
[2:34:32] fresh manna
[2:34:39] not my manna not the message manna
[2:34:44] fresh manna from
[2:34:48] your quickener to your mind
[2:34:52] to a manifestation in your life he says
[2:35:00] he said a hawk used to hunt
[2:35:04] his own
[2:35:10] manna
[2:35:15] but today he takes what an automobile
[2:35:19] run over or what the vultures eat
[2:35:22] he hops like one he looks like one
[2:35:26] we so ardenned ourselves
[2:35:30] to the modern world our women cut their
[2:35:33] hair
[2:35:34] and wear shorts our men with not
[2:35:37] enough backbone to stand in the pulpit
[2:35:40] and tell the truth
[2:35:42] we're we've long got soft
[2:35:45] on the word god send the holy ghost
[2:35:50] the what the quickening power
[2:35:54] and look out them eagles somewhere
[2:35:58] that's ready to stand yonder
[2:36:01] no matter what takes place they'll
[2:36:04] soar into the unknown
[2:36:09] not set on a telephone wire and
[2:36:12] look for some sunday school literature
[2:36:16] to come in
[2:36:19] if you're not soaring this morning is
[2:36:22] sunday school literature
[2:36:31] we run to the internet for this we run
[2:36:34] to the internet for that
[2:36:36] instead of taking a tape
[2:36:39] sitting down and
[2:36:43] getting into the atmosphere
[2:36:47] it'll do wonders for us not as a body
[2:36:51] as individuals
[2:36:55] then as individuals you'll spread the
[2:36:57] fire
[2:36:59] it'll it'll just it'll just it'll move
[2:37:02] not some sunday school
[2:37:04] let me have the word in its freshness
[2:37:08] of power and demonstration the holy
[2:37:11] ghost
[2:37:12] we need easter a resurrection
[2:37:16] that's potential my friends if you're
[2:37:19] satisfied with such
[2:37:20] caring of the world there's something
[2:37:22] wrong
[2:37:25] my brother sister let me say to you
[2:37:30] this in godly fear
[2:37:34] knowing that i may never live to see
[2:37:36] another easter
[2:37:38] you know that was true
[2:37:43] he said i'm saying this to you
[2:37:48] about being afraid about what the real
[2:37:51] evidence is
[2:37:52] about getting in the atmosphere i'm
[2:37:55] saying to you
[2:37:56] this in godly fear knowing i will never
[2:37:59] see
[2:38:00] another easter
[2:38:04] how heavy should this set yes
[2:38:11] but there's one thing sure when a
[2:38:14] genuine
[2:38:15] foreign son of god by the word of god
[2:38:19] hears that voice of god he'll rise
[2:38:23] and go meet it
[2:38:26] it's the potential that he's going to
[2:38:30] meet
[2:38:31] the real living word as
[2:38:34] he was the bride will meet the
[2:38:37] bridegroom
[2:38:38] she's a part of that body to what is
[2:38:42] this message to us when we rise
[2:38:45] to meet it it's the evidence
[2:38:49] the potential to us that we're going to
[2:38:52] meet the real
[2:38:54] word himself amen
[2:38:58] oh you're part of a resurrection church
[2:39:02] that's why the gospel is pressing into
[2:39:04] us more
[2:39:05] about how we think more where our stand
[2:39:09] is
[2:39:09] more lord i i need so much cleansing
[2:39:13] lord
[2:39:13] please come and and fill me with
[2:39:16] quickening power
[2:39:19] the quickening powers got me this far
[2:39:22] but i know in order to go further i'm
[2:39:25] gonna have to be quickened
[2:39:27] quickened and quickened and quickened
[2:39:30] and quickened
[2:39:31] let the quickening power quicken the
[2:39:34] word to you
[2:39:36] this is not preached with condemnation
[2:39:38] this morning
[2:39:39] it's preached with understanding
[2:39:42] so we can see what this world is
[2:39:46] what their thought pattern is first of
[2:39:48] all they're creating an atmosphere for
[2:39:50] us to be afraid in
[2:39:52] secondly they're trying to get us to
[2:39:54] where we can't think
[2:39:57] like a christian
[2:40:02] walking on pins and needles no beef be
[2:40:04] afraid
[2:40:06] be brave don't accept that fear
[2:40:10] be strong in the lord
[2:40:13] amen he'll keep you and he'll guide you
[2:40:17] and when the fear was gone
[2:40:20] was when they showed up on the street
[2:40:23] and may lord
[2:40:24] god let that set in our heart this
[2:40:27] morning
[2:40:28] as that we just wanted to spend that
[2:40:30] little time of fellowship
[2:40:33] in in those words and
[2:40:36] it's right there you know i mean
[2:40:40] you can't make these things up you know
[2:40:42] what i mean
[2:40:43] i mean this is a seer
[2:40:47] looking at the church because he said
[2:40:49] that
[2:40:50] i'm trying to tell the church this is
[2:40:52] the church the quickening of the mind
[2:40:55] and he knew that if we weren't careful
[2:40:57] we were going to get to the place
[2:40:59] where this message just becomes sunday
[2:41:02] school to us
[2:41:05] the preachers getting up preaching out
[2:41:07] of the message preaching out of the
[2:41:08] message preaching out of the message
[2:41:11] and i can understand why people that
[2:41:13] only listen to tapes
[2:41:17] can feel the way they feel
[2:41:20] but i want to say you can only listen to
[2:41:23] tapes and not get in the atmosphere
[2:41:25] so we've got to strike that balance
[2:41:29] you know what i mean and i i want to
[2:41:32] preach the gospel to you i want to do it
[2:41:34] without fear or favor
[2:41:35] i want to just point you to the things
[2:41:38] that are here
[2:41:40] and i just believe these messages are
[2:41:42] very critical
[2:41:43] yes sir because the next message is
[2:41:46] that all these messages that brother
[2:41:48] branham starts preaching
[2:41:50] in 65 and
[2:41:53] every part of the message is equal but
[2:41:56] he's putting things out
[2:41:58] here that are just
[2:42:01] amazing and i want
[2:42:04] i sav don't you so lord bless you this
[2:42:07] morning
[2:42:08] we trust that the spirit of the lord
[2:42:10] will
[2:42:11] guide you and keep you sorry we're long
[2:42:14] we'll
[2:42:14] we won't have a longer service but i
[2:42:18] hope that
[2:42:18] stimulated you this morning maybe you
[2:42:21] saw things you didn't
[2:42:24] see before and the idea is not for you
[2:42:26] to see things you didn't
[2:42:28] see before the idea is for you to look
[2:42:31] back and say
[2:42:32] i never saw that or i i'm reading it now
[2:42:36] but and i'm trying to say if we would
[2:42:39] spend a little more time
[2:42:41] getting in the atmosphere more of those
[2:42:44] things would stand up to us
[2:42:46] individually and we wouldn't have to
[2:42:48] rely on a sunday school lesson
[2:42:51] i know it's a paradox but
[2:42:55] our desire is that this quickening power
[2:42:58] becomes real to each one of us god bless
[2:43:01] you let us stand this morning
[2:43:08] we've been uh keeping
[2:43:11] sister uh karen pruitt
[2:43:15] in our prayers uh looking for god to
[2:43:18] really do something for her she's been a
[2:43:22] a lovely servant of the lord and it
[2:43:27] it you know i just just feel she's got
[2:43:30] the faith and
[2:43:31] and i just like my prayers to help push
[2:43:34] and so we can have a prayer meeting
[2:43:39] this tuesday and we'll be praying for
[2:43:41] her then
[2:43:43] and so we just trust that you would
[2:43:46] definitely keep her in prayer
[2:43:50] and um and just ask the lord
[2:43:53] let's it seek the mind of the lord
[2:43:57] let's let us bow our heads if you have a
[2:43:59] need this morning
[2:44:03] maybe maybe that little bit of fear has
[2:44:09] been in your heart
[2:44:12] maybe you've just been satisfied with
[2:44:16] going to church
[2:44:21] or maybe that you've lost your identity
[2:44:26] as an eagle to fly into the heavenlies
[2:44:37] that you just you don't want to go and
[2:44:39] get revelation on your own
[2:44:43] you don't want god to speak to your
[2:44:44] heart because
[2:44:46] maybe nobody else will hear what you
[2:44:48] heard
[2:44:50] and you've got to stand there and
[2:44:55] let what was quickened in your mind
[2:44:57] manifest in your flesh
[2:45:01] and it's easier just to
[2:45:05] walk in what everybody else is talking
[2:45:08] about what everybody else was thinking
[2:45:10] about
[2:45:13] but you lose your identity as a person
[2:45:17] that god created
[2:45:19] to fly into the atmosphere
[2:45:22] and get fresh manna for yourself
[2:45:27] and that's my desire this morning lord
[2:45:30] for the people
[2:45:32] is that they understand that this is
[2:45:34] their heritage
[2:45:37] that this is something that's given
[2:45:40] that they can do
[2:45:45] they could be eight years old they could
[2:45:48] be
[2:45:48] 10 years old 15 years old
[2:45:53] but if they're eagles they can flop out
[2:45:55] of that yard
[2:45:57] and soar
[2:45:58] [Music]
[2:46:00] and lord i ask that you make this real
[2:46:03] to the people
[2:46:05] lord i ask that you make it real to me
[2:46:10] father that i can get that spirit
[2:46:12] outside the gift
[2:46:14] and just have it in my life lord
[2:46:20] lord you know all the struggles each of
[2:46:22] us have
[2:46:25] but you promised you'd never leave us
[2:46:28] nor forsake us
[2:46:31] and this quickening gift
[2:46:34] you said it brought us back into
[2:46:36] fellowship with you and
[2:46:39] lord i just don't want to be a believer
[2:46:42] i don't want to sit in the upper room
[2:46:44] believing you're the word believing you
[2:46:47] have a message
[2:46:48] believing everything that's written on
[2:46:50] the and
[2:46:51] spoken on the tapes and just not have
[2:46:54] any
[2:46:57] life
[2:47:01] i believe there's something higher that
[2:47:03] you're calling us do
[2:47:06] and lord i pray that you just let that
[2:47:09] set
[2:47:10] and if there's anyone they just like to
[2:47:12] lift their hand to you this morning and
[2:47:14] say lord
[2:47:17] i need a more serious
[2:47:22] and more dedicated understanding
[2:47:26] of the hour i'm living in
[2:47:30] lord i want eyes at that i can see
[2:47:33] really what's going
[2:47:34] on in the spirit
[2:47:37] open to me my own life father

[2:47:46] word lord

[2:48:11] lord if i could produce it i would
[2:48:17] lord even laying on of hands

[2:48:24] believing that you'll come down
[2:48:26] and quicken father i ask that those that
[2:48:29] are sick
[2:48:31] that you would quicken to their minds

[2:48:41] know it's there
[2:48:42] and they know they're walking to it and
[2:48:44] they know they're going to possess it
[2:48:46] because you spoke it to them
[2:48:50] father and we bring sister karen before
