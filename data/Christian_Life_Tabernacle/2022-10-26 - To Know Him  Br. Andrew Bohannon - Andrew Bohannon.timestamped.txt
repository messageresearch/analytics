[27:53] who certainly
[27:55] thankful for that amen
[27:59] a reminder there will be a youth meaning
[28:01] this coming Friday for single ages 13 to
[28:05] 30 never been married it's going to be
[28:07] from 6 p.m to 9 00 p.m here at the
[28:10] church amen
[28:12] amen
[28:14] amen tomorrow is a big day
[28:16] a very important day amen
[28:20] I wasn't feeling 100 but I wanted to be
[28:23] here to just make sure that I remind all
[28:26] of you tomorrow is a big day tomorrow is
[28:28] Friday David's birthday and
[28:30] it may not certainly I appreciate him I
[28:33] I was
[28:34] just thinking about it from home and uh
[28:38] I was thinking about all the things that
[28:39] barbano said about a shepherd He said
[28:43] he leads the ship to a pasture
[28:45] and the water
[28:47] it protects his ship from the wild
[28:49] animals
[28:50] it says he guards the ship in the night
[28:53] and in all weathers and he keeps them
[28:56] and and is always with him in fact it
[28:59] says one place that he gets to a place
[29:01] where he smells like a sheep he talks
[29:03] like a sheep
[29:05] and you know
[29:08] we certainly
[29:11] have to be mindful at this times like
[29:14] this that we could certainly just thank
[29:17] God for having a Godly past or one we
[29:20] could certainly say he fills this
[29:22] criteria he leads us to the water you
[29:24] know so many churches today can't even
[29:26] play the message in their churches they
[29:29] they contend with someone coming and
[29:31] telling them what the prophet said and
[29:33] putting together their minds and and
[29:35] what the prophets say and didn't say but
[29:38] to have a pastor who before he could
[29:40] preach it will take what the prophet say
[29:42] so you know before before he can even
[29:45] open his mouth what he actually said I
[29:48] think that's really important that's
[29:50] really something that that is to be
[29:52] commended and I I've always felt like in
[29:54] this congregation we are the most fed of
[29:57] all the people all the churches that
[29:59] there is we receive the word exactly as
[30:02] it was spoken you can hear it and go
[30:05] check it for yourself and found out
[30:06] that's what he said but when I'm says in
[30:09] the message Jehovah of Miracles he says
[30:14] I'm going to skip some of it he says
[30:17] this is a great day because the Lord has
[30:19] made and no doubt many of you in the
[30:22] service this morning you enjoy the
[30:24] wonderful fellowship and and your
[30:27] pastor's message and that's good I'm so
[30:30] glad you did it says it says just
[30:32] remember
[30:33] it says back him up in your prayers it
[30:36] says he's your he's The Shepherd of the
[30:39] flock and the shepherd is is a feeder
[30:43] he's a feeder and then he says so you
[30:46] you back him up in your prayer you
[30:49] support him with everything every in
[30:52] every way that you can and God will keep
[30:55] giving you those messages to him
[30:58] so it's it's it's our support it's a
[31:01] coming together in prayer and doing us
[31:04] and then God will keep giving out those
[31:06] messages with him
[31:08] he says again in another place it says
[31:10] any Shepherd that is interested in
[31:13] getting a sheep with with with with
[31:15] vitamins and those and these are the
[31:19] spiritual vitamins as it was it helps
[31:23] the ship to grow in into stronger Faith
[31:27] In Our God and then it says I appreciate
[31:30] such man
[31:32] Shepherd is always on duty did you know
[31:36] Shepherd of the sheep is with them both
[31:40] day and night
[31:41] someone who's you could you could you
[31:44] could always count on him to be there
[31:46] regardless of what you're going through
[31:48] to know that he's going to be there so I
[31:50] I say this to say you know it's you know
[31:54] as they say it's important to tell
[31:56] someone things when it's still alive
[31:58] then write a whole list when he's dead
[32:00] when he's gone and and say how wonderful
[32:02] it was I think it's important that we
[32:04] appreciate the pastor that God has given
[32:06] us to to appreciate the things that he
[32:08] does for us and and and and all that he
[32:11] puts so we can receive the message so
[32:14] don't forget
[32:15] text him tomorrow
[32:17] you can start at midnight
[32:19] you can start sending your texts wait
[32:22] until 4am for the calls you could text
[32:25] him and just wish him happy birthday and
[32:28] let him know that you're praying for him
[32:30] amen

[32:34] he's having surgery tomorrow and
[32:37] everything that may go well amen if you
[32:40] have any need and or something that you

[32:44] lived to end up to him he certainly sees
[32:46] your heart Amen brother Tim Salah if you

[33:17] a reflection of the day that we're

[45:37] says and be not conformed to this world
[45:41] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[45:43] your mind
[45:45] that ye may be that ye may prove what is
[45:49] that good and acceptable
[45:51] and perfect will of God
[45:54] amen and also over in Genesis chapter 1
[45:58] .
[46:03] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 11 through
[46:07] 12.
[46:10] and God said let the Earth bring forth
[46:13] grass
[46:15] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[46:18] tree yielding fruit
[46:20] after his kind
[46:22] whose seed is in itself
[46:25] upon the Earth and it was so
[46:28] and the Earth brought forth grass and
[46:31] herbs yielding seed after his kind and
[46:35] the tree yielding fruit
[46:37] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[46:40] and God saw that it was good
[46:43] amen you may have your seeds we trust
[46:46] the Lord will add a blessing to the
[46:48] reading of his word if we were dismissed
[46:50] tonight and having
[46:52] having had read the word we would be
[46:54] affected and God would have done
[46:57] something for us but I believe God's got
[46:58] more amen
[47:01] you know I was just thinking about a
[47:05] a quote that
[47:07] was read over
[47:10] this past weekend and we just want to
[47:13] try to
[47:14] share a little something about
[47:17] being united with another nature in The
[47:20] Invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[47:22] statement was made in paragraph 213 it
[47:26] says that's the reason you have to be
[47:28] born again
[47:30] you have to separate
[47:32] you have to die to that first husband
[47:35] you can't live with it
[47:37] you just can't say well I'll divorce him
[47:40] and hang him up until an occasion no sir
[47:43] no writing of divorcement he dies
[47:46] the nature of the world
[47:48] has to die
[47:50] every Speck of him has to die
[47:53] you have to be reunited again with
[47:55] another nature amen if that's the
[47:58] emphasis that brother branham's pointing
[48:00] out and
[48:02] you know if there's ever an ice have
[48:05] that we might see we want to make this
[48:08] our vision this is a goal that we want
[48:10] to place before us is the old man the
[48:13] old nature every bit of it has to die
[48:17] we can't take any of our past as as good
[48:21] as it might seem
[48:23] you know as as much as it may have
[48:26] benefited us to feel a certain security
[48:29] or to feel a certain benefit the old man
[48:33] and all of its accolades and all of its
[48:36] accomplishments they have to rot away so
[48:39] that this new nature this this nature
[48:42] from the new birth can actually be on
[48:46] display amen isn't that wonderful that
[48:48] you know God's promised to bring forth
[48:52] that in in our lives and you know it's
[48:56] you know I I so appreciate like I think
[48:59] it was said earlier you know how we can
[49:01] come together and you know God has
[49:04] brought us you know he's restored the
[49:05] word and we can have faith in the pure
[49:08] word of God again and
[49:10] you know it it brings like like a Unity
[49:13] you know and that's that's kind of a
[49:17] theme is you know we want to
[49:19] unite not just you know in Fellowship
[49:23] here but each one of us have
[49:25] individually we must Unite with Christ
[49:27] by the way of a new birth you know and
[49:30] and in order for this old nature and
[49:33] this old man to to to you know to die
[49:37] out you know you got to starve him
[49:40] you know it's just hey I get it we're
[49:43] human you know we got to go to school we
[49:46] got work we got things with family and
[49:49] you know what there's a way to go about
[49:51] it but to not feed that nature
[49:54] you know God's given us a blood that you
[49:57] know we're we're in Christ we can die
[49:59] with Christ
[50:01] and yet we don't have to to to you know
[50:04] take that second look Brothers
[50:07] you know uh young people we don't have
[50:10] to uh play that extra video game we
[50:14] don't have to take up the next posting
[50:16] on on uh you know Instagram or whatever
[50:19] those things just to somehow feel better
[50:21] you know there's things that we can do
[50:23] to to just you know I'm going to
[50:25] sacrifice that because I know that God's
[50:27] working something in me renewing me and
[50:30] bringing United me to another nature
[50:34] you know this nature is is an eternal
[50:37] life nature
[50:40] this nature doesn't consume the
[50:42] blessings of God just for myself
[50:45] right
[50:47] the family of God they're not living for
[50:49] themselves they're living for a future
[50:52] day
[50:53] right
[50:54] I heard it said and and I believe it's
[50:57] true
[50:58] eternal life is living for others
[51:01] amen you know that's the only thing
[51:03] really that will be Resurrected
[51:05] is the life we live for others how can
[51:07] we serve God everybody desires to serve
[51:09] God the nominal World wants to serve God
[51:13] you know there's even people in politics
[51:15] and religion they believe they're
[51:16] serving God but they're killing you
[51:20] you see but now we just
[51:23] oh my we're not
[51:25] we're not trying to live our life in a
[51:28] rearview mirror
[51:29] you know we don't want to try to take
[51:32] all of the past successes or failures
[51:35] and try to bring them into our current
[51:37] life because God has created something
[51:40] that's a part of himself in you and me
[51:44] amen I had this experience and
[51:48] before we get into this message I'm
[51:50] going to take some quotes out of the
[51:53] power of transformation but you know I
[51:55] had an experience we did some traveling
[51:57] and
[51:58] you know the Lord allowed us to go to
[52:00] Florida and it was a wonderful trip and
[52:02] I noticed that sometimes and it just
[52:05] spoke to me about sometimes in life you
[52:08] know you have you have obligations you
[52:10] have you know goals to meet you have a
[52:13] job you know they they have goals for
[52:15] you and you have obligations in school
[52:17] you gotta you know have a passing grade
[52:19] used to be 70 was passing I don't know
[52:21] what it is now but you know you have
[52:23] these certain requirements in life and
[52:25] so it puts a pressure on you and it
[52:27] keeps on you and it's like a the hounds
[52:29] of Hell dogging you you know and it's
[52:31] just kind of pooling on you and it
[52:32] constantly is training you but keeping
[52:34] you pressing towards a mark right you
[52:37] got to go ahead of you and so as we were
[52:40] doing some traveling and we were kind of
[52:42] following and it wasn't just me driving
[52:44] and everybody's in one car we're we're
[52:46] carpooling so I noticed that as I'm
[52:49] driving now I'm trying to strategize
[52:51] with traffic and things that are going
[52:53] on around me
[52:55] and I'm trying to over anticipate
[52:57] because I got somebody that's following
[52:58] me
[52:59] you see there's some people that are
[53:01] following your example
[53:04] there's people that are watching your
[53:06] life because your life is an epistle
[53:09] read of all men
[53:12] and so as we realize that God has
[53:14] planted something in us and he's
[53:17] reuniting us with the nature that this
[53:20] life it's an eternal life can be on
[53:22] display because that's the greatest
[53:25] drawing card that this world has is the
[53:27] manifestation of this hour
[53:31] it's not the days of Noah where some man
[53:35] is is building an ark or a replica of
[53:38] the Ark no no this is the Fulfillment of
[53:42] Malachi 4. I will send you you're you're
[53:46] part of that fulfillment I'm part of
[53:48] that fulfillment I'm the you you're the
[53:50] you in that he I'm identified he did
[53:53] this for me he sent Elijah in this end
[53:57] time
[53:59] aren't you happy about that
[54:02] you know you think about
[54:05] the seed that God planted
[54:08] you know within the seed
[54:11] when God was in the beginning in Genesis
[54:14] he was he was there and he said let
[54:17] there be this
[54:18] right let there be that
[54:21] let there be this and let there be that
[54:22] he's so in seed sow in seed and you know
[54:25] as God you know God doesn't get in a
[54:28] hurry like me
[54:29] well I got a deadline and I'm
[54:32] we got to get this done got to get this
[54:34] done but see that's not our God
[54:37] God don't get in a hurry and sometimes I
[54:40] feel in my heart like I'm doing wrong
[54:42] because I'm just trying to squeeze every
[54:44] moment you know trying to be super ultra
[54:46] productive what is that
[54:48] that's being conformed
[54:50] but be not conformed but be transformed
[54:53] by the renewing of your mind how are we
[54:56] going to be uh this transformation is a
[54:59] change from what we were to what God
[55:01] wants us to be what he spoke us to be
[55:05] we are going to be that
[55:07] because nothing can hinder that
[55:10] nothing's going to stop it
[55:14] but God doesn't get in a hurry
[55:16] and so
[55:18] I feel you know sometimes a shame
[55:22] you know because
[55:23] you look how you you get the busyness of
[55:26] life and then all of a sudden you're in
[55:27] the Stream of that channel and you just
[55:29] look like everybody else
[55:32] but we're called to be separated
[55:34] a people that wait on the Lord a people
[55:38] that that you know my God has made
[55:41] provision for me
[55:43] I don't have to fret for tomorrow he
[55:46] holds my tomorrow
[55:49] you know tomorrow's not guaranteed
[55:51] anyway
[55:53] but once you've been born again
[55:55] oh what a hope there's a hope of a a
[55:58] land Beyond this
[56:01] time and this Dimension oh my and I
[56:05] thank God that he gives us a foretaste
[56:07] he gives us a down payment oh bless his
[56:10] name we we have an assurance
[56:12] it's steadfast amen
[56:16] thank God for The Incorruptible seed
[56:18] that's been sown into our hearts amen
[56:20] let my heart be the bedding ground Lord
[56:23] isn't that the Cry Of Your Heart Lord
[56:25] what you said in your word you you'll
[56:29] raise up stones but oh God here am I
[56:32] amen I'm a ready heart I want to see you
[56:36] moving me amen
[56:39] amen it's not just for my neighbor
[56:41] but oh God let it be living out in me
[56:45] amen
[56:54] you know we want to be transformed by
[56:56] the renewing of our mind and you know a
[56:58] lot of times in our normal days you know
[57:01] we rehearse the same thoughts over and
[57:03] over and over again because the devil
[57:06] Works through memory through reasonings
[57:07] for conscience imaginations and is
[57:10] constantly worn against us because it's
[57:12] it's it's almost like it's it's an
[57:15] unpenetrable reality but the only
[57:17] reality that we must live in is the word
[57:20] of God
[57:21] amen the revealed word of this hour
[57:26] and so it takes it takes a washing it
[57:29] takes a dedication
[57:31] you know it takes an Earnest Cry of the
[57:33] heart God you know I'm not satisfied
[57:37] with just enough
[57:39] I want more
[57:41] and God has more
[57:45] you wouldn't be hungering and thirsting
[57:47] tonight for more if there wasn't
[57:49] something to satisfy that deep call
[57:52] ain't that wonderful
[57:54] and it's an inexhaustible Fountain
[57:57] that's right
[57:59] that's the source of life that we're
[58:02] drawing from and you know
[58:09] I don't I don't believe I'll be long but
[58:11] I'm just holding on
[58:21] you know
[58:22] my pastor made a statement that just
[58:26] keeps kind of
[58:27] kind of rehearsing in my heart and mind
[58:30] and and I think it's a good statement he
[58:32] said you know
[58:36] sacrifice what you know to know him
[58:39] and you know a lot of the times you know
[58:42] the things that we think is the things
[58:44] that we've discovered or experienced and
[58:46] we've declared as a truth or a reality
[58:49] but but really
[58:52] I want to know him I don't want to know
[58:54] nothing but Jesus Christ and him
[58:56] crucified
[58:58] and you know the busyness and the
[59:01] goings-on tries to pull us into that
[59:04] channel of to know more about
[59:07] where the world's headed as far as what
[59:10] the next war or the next earthquake or
[59:13] the next this we're human
[59:16] we deal with these thoughts
[59:18] but God is challenging us and telling us
[59:21] where the source of life is and where
[59:23] the renewing comes is in the word of God
[59:27] and I just I'm so grateful you know I
[59:30] want to sacrifice everything else to
[59:32] know him
[59:33] and the power of his resurrection amen
[59:36] and not just the thought of knowing him
[59:39] but to know him the person the person of
[59:42] Truth the person of healing the person
[59:45] of Resurrection because God that's what
[59:48] he does he comes and he he tells you
[59:50] that oh you know I've died for you you
[59:54] know there was this great Chasm and and
[59:56] because of the Fall because of your your
[59:58] your your mother Eve you were lost and
[1:00:02] there was this great Chasm but but I
[1:00:04] paid the price I I covered that with my
[1:00:06] own blood and oh then you receive it you
[1:00:10] accept it not because oh just so much
[1:00:12] that you repented but God's word has
[1:00:15] found you amen God's word has come to
[1:00:18] you in this end time
[1:00:20] and he's breathed life into your vessel
[1:00:23] oh praise God thank the Lord for his
[1:00:25] goodness
[1:00:28] you know we're not looking for some
[1:00:30] outside anointing
[1:00:31] right we're looking for that inside
[1:00:35] something
[1:00:36] to burst forth amen
[1:00:39] there's something on the inside
[1:00:42] that God placed within that seed power
[1:00:45] to transform
[1:00:48] all it needs is the right atmosphere the
[1:00:52] water the the seasonal rains come and
[1:00:55] and it brings forth a crop amen and the
[1:00:58] certain Sun if you know as we've we've
[1:01:01] heard that you know when the sun comes
[1:01:03] up it's kind of low it's that's not
[1:01:05] really the growing season but when it's
[1:01:07] at full strength yeah and that's that's
[1:01:08] the real growing time amen aren't you
[1:01:12] thankful that you've come in this
[1:01:13] evening time
[1:01:15] where the light has come to bring you to
[1:01:18] life
[1:01:20] I'm so grateful
[1:01:24] now
[1:01:26] the power of transformation brother
[1:01:28] Branham says this and
[1:01:30] paragraph 59
[1:01:34] he says now we want to be transformed
[1:01:37] ourselves by the renewing of our mind
[1:01:41] see not what we have here on this Earth
[1:01:44] or what we're going to look for on this
[1:01:47] Earth
[1:01:48] but what we are coming to in the world
[1:01:52] to come
[1:01:54] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:01:59] you know it's it's so easy to get caught
[1:02:02] up into the things that we can see
[1:02:05] you know I'm struggling with this
[1:02:07] you know I I keep going to this and it's
[1:02:11] it's like a a broken record here I am
[1:02:13] again
[1:02:14] this is the same thing and it's like a
[1:02:18] reoccurring theme I can't seem to get
[1:02:20] the victory
[1:02:21] so we're going over
[1:02:23] but God said
[1:02:26] that
[1:02:28] there's there's many things of course
[1:02:30] that give us overcoming
[1:02:33] but you know we've got to take up the
[1:02:36] word upon our lips you know it's not
[1:02:38] just thinking the word
[1:02:40] but it's actually speaking the word to
[1:02:42] this body this old nature you know this
[1:02:45] Nature has to hear you say I can do all
[1:02:48] things through Christ Jesus who
[1:02:50] strengthened me it's not this same cycle
[1:02:53] this same cycle because the power of
[1:02:55] transformation is in the seed it's just
[1:02:58] waiting for a heart of Faith to speak it
[1:03:01] and believe it and act in faith let's
[1:03:04] jump let's jump out in faith because
[1:03:07] you're the word
[1:03:09] all the potentials of God are dwelling
[1:03:12] in you
[1:03:13] but we don't want to mix that old nature
[1:03:15] and try to pull God's nature and
[1:03:18] manufacture something
[1:03:22] that'll just bring death
[1:03:25] you know
[1:03:29] think about what
[1:03:31] you know
[1:03:33] David he wanted to do something good for
[1:03:34] the Lord
[1:03:35] he was anointed to do the job but it
[1:03:38] wasn't the will of God for him to do it
[1:03:42] so praise God we got a perfect will to
[1:03:46] seek
[1:03:47] we've got a perfect will that God wants
[1:03:50] to lead us into each one of our lives
[1:03:55] in the great composition of the Sheep
[1:03:57] music every single vessel here every
[1:04:00] single soul everything everybody has a
[1:04:03] part to play younger old middle-aged uh
[1:04:07] woman a man we all have a part to play
[1:04:12] in this great Symphony
[1:04:14] amen and it's you know yeah we we know
[1:04:19] it's you know be a father to the
[1:04:21] fatherless feed the poor we know that
[1:04:23] those are things that are attributed
[1:04:26] with the gospel but we want to go out
[1:04:28] and and do the will of God not just here
[1:04:33] in church where we're worshiping
[1:04:34] thanking God free in the spirit
[1:04:38] but let the freedom and liberty that we
[1:04:41] have here tonight
[1:04:43] let it be a factual when the neighbors
[1:04:46] are out there and they're I don't know
[1:04:48] how I'm going to be able to get my car
[1:04:50] running again
[1:04:52] yeah I don't either but you know what I
[1:04:54] know a god you know can we be available
[1:04:56] can we be willing vessels because see
[1:05:00] the power to change the situation is
[1:05:03] lying in a seed form within you
[1:05:06] to a world that doesn't see what you see
[1:05:10] by faith
[1:05:11] the the possibility
[1:05:19] so grateful that there's something on
[1:05:21] the inside when everything on the
[1:05:24] outside looked like it's just coming to
[1:05:26] Pieces there's something on the inside
[1:05:28] when we look God's in full control
[1:05:33] he's not going to lose a one every
[1:05:35] single promise that he made to you
[1:05:37] concerning your family
[1:05:40] concerning your end
[1:05:42] oh
[1:05:44] he's going to fulfill it
[1:05:51] you know I wrestled with plain about 15
[1:05:53] minutes of this tape because I'm not a
[1:05:56] very good read of it
[1:06:06] you know I just I so appreciate
[1:06:10] um God being the example
[1:06:13] you know
[1:06:16] the scripture says in John 13
[1:06:19] and 7 he says Jesus answered and said
[1:06:23] unto him what I do thou knowest not now
[1:06:26] but Thou shalt know Hereafter well I'm
[1:06:30] so grateful that a lot of the times what
[1:06:32] God has done for us we don't know at the
[1:06:35] moment that he's doing it
[1:06:38] don't you find that to be the case in
[1:06:40] your life a lot of times God's done some
[1:06:44] things for you and we don't realize it
[1:06:46] but let's let's get ours our tuning fork
[1:06:50] on yeah and let's start recognizing God
[1:06:52] is doing what he promised
[1:06:56] he said that he would Purge you of all
[1:06:59] your iniquity
[1:07:00] right he paid the price and and so let's
[1:07:04] not lower the standard even if what
[1:07:06] we're looking at in the mirror doesn't
[1:07:10] line up but let's not let that lower our
[1:07:14] confession
[1:07:15] because what God planted it will come to
[1:07:19] manifestation
[1:07:21] God can't fail and he can't lie and he
[1:07:24] sowed The Incorruptible seed
[1:07:27] and it must come forth amen
[1:07:32] you know he's
[1:07:35] in John you know he says that and that's
[1:07:37] our wonderful communion scripture in it
[1:07:39] it's just amazing
[1:07:43] you know he wanted to commune with them
[1:07:45] on what he was doing
[1:07:47] God wants to commune with us what he's
[1:07:49] doing in our lives he's cleansing us
[1:07:52] he's he's renewing our mind he's he's
[1:07:55] preparing us and conditioning us that he
[1:07:58] can manifest himself in each one of us
[1:08:02] to our father to our mother to our
[1:08:05] brother to our children
[1:08:08] oh my but there's this old man
[1:08:11] that needs to be renewed we need to be
[1:08:13] renewed in the spirit of our mind
[1:08:16] the scripture admonishes don't be so
[1:08:18] soon shaken in mind
[1:08:21] right we have the thing that brings the
[1:08:23] stabilizers
[1:08:26] the word of God
[1:08:29] you know in this message power of
[1:08:31] transformation brother Branham makes
[1:08:33] this statement
[1:08:34] in verse or in paragraph 40 he says
[1:08:40] I'm 41. but dear friends I'm not a young
[1:08:43] like I like you all this morning but I'm
[1:08:47] old
[1:08:48] and I've been through many hard battles
[1:08:50] see
[1:08:51] and by going through these hard battles
[1:08:54] brings you where you are this morning
[1:09:01] I'm sure you understand that
[1:09:05] God has put me through it
[1:09:07] that my life might open up a way to say
[1:09:11] this is it see
[1:09:13] then you all have
[1:09:16] run over that road and before me there
[1:09:19] was someone who opened the way
[1:09:22] for me to go and when we opened the road
[1:09:26] one for another you see as you see
[1:09:29] sometimes these old veterans getting old
[1:09:34] and his his marks all over him Paul said
[1:09:38] in one time I bear in my body the marks
[1:09:40] of Jesus Christ you see how Timothy
[1:09:43] looked upon those I guess with reverence
[1:09:46] as he committed young Timothy
[1:09:49] I just I think about
[1:09:52] you know
[1:09:53] we know who that one that was the
[1:09:55] example to brother Branham and that was
[1:09:57] our Lord Jesus Christ and he's he was
[1:10:01] not only the messenger but he he was the
[1:10:05] message he he declared the very Life of
[1:10:09] Christ that had come to maturity
[1:10:12] amen and so I'm so grateful that someone
[1:10:15] who would who would lay their life down
[1:10:18] that Christ might pick it up
[1:10:20] and express his own very nature amen
[1:10:24] isn't that wonderful that we have the
[1:10:26] same promise to to to be reunited with
[1:10:29] divine nature what a privileged people
[1:10:33] you know there's people when you get
[1:10:34] down going down the road and they're
[1:10:36] driving 90 miles an hour where are they
[1:10:38] going well they just turned on the stop
[1:10:40] sign and then they're at the convenience
[1:10:42] store what are they in the hurry for
[1:10:45] there's there's an anointing there's a
[1:10:47] press upon the people you know the
[1:10:50] scripture says they drive to and fro
[1:10:52] but yet we have the word of God
[1:10:56] my
[1:10:57] my
[1:10:59] and to think that so many
[1:11:02] have laid their life down
[1:11:04] for this gospel
[1:11:06] you know and and I like I
[1:11:09] I certainly would agree with what
[1:11:11] brother Billy said about our pastor you
[1:11:13] know there's there's marks of the Lord
[1:11:16] amen and so I'm so grateful that you
[1:11:20] know he hasn't lifted up a Ministry he
[1:11:22] hasn't lifted up a man he's lifted up
[1:11:24] the word
[1:11:25] amen so that's what I want to do in my
[1:11:27] life and honoring of a man that's that's
[1:11:30] has scars that's been battle trained
[1:11:33] you know there's there's sufferings that
[1:11:35] we go through there's misunderstandings
[1:11:37] there's hardships there's things that we
[1:11:40] bear
[1:11:41] but we take our position amen
[1:11:44] we know God can do Supernatural
[1:11:46] but when we've received the new birth
[1:11:48] and the promise of a life forever
[1:11:51] if if God doesn't supernaturally heal my
[1:11:55] body I still have the promise that he
[1:11:57] would never lead me never forsake me he
[1:12:00] will be with me even in me to the very
[1:12:02] end
[1:12:03] well he said he would give me the grace
[1:12:05] to bear and I'm trusting in his word
[1:12:08] because he can't lie
[1:12:11] Lord renew my mind let me see this the
[1:12:14] right way
[1:12:15] God I need iceap I need healing for my
[1:12:17] eyes you're a Healer
[1:12:19] God come
[1:12:22] take the bedding ground of my heart and
[1:12:25] let it be
[1:12:27] that this Lover of My Soul will come
[1:12:29] give me a renewed Vision renew my mind
[1:12:33] amen
[1:12:36] now transforming
[1:12:39] I used to work at the Public Service
[1:12:41] Company
[1:12:42] where we had Transformers
[1:12:44] the word
[1:12:46] the word itself means something
[1:12:48] transforms means something to be changed
[1:12:51] something that's changed from one thing
[1:12:53] to another
[1:12:54] oh my
[1:12:57] you know sometimes you go so many I
[1:13:00] don't know how it is with you but you
[1:13:03] know I gave my heart to Lord in 99 and
[1:13:05] it's been a journey but sometimes when
[1:13:08] you get a few years clicked from the
[1:13:11] time that he's he's made himself so real
[1:13:13] sometimes you you kind of forget the way
[1:13:17] that you were your old nature though you
[1:13:20] still battle it in increments
[1:13:23] oh my
[1:13:25] you know even the scripture says all
[1:13:29] have come short of the glory of God
[1:13:30] there is going to be no flesh glorified
[1:13:34] in his presence
[1:13:36] you know I think it's a great admonition
[1:13:38] no matter if we've been serving 50 years
[1:13:40] or five days or five minutes don't put
[1:13:44] no confidence in the flesh
[1:13:47] even if I don't feel good even if I'm
[1:13:50] tired God you made a promise God you're
[1:13:53] working your will out in my life
[1:13:55] no matter the hardship no matter the
[1:13:58] struggle God you're more than able and
[1:14:01] I'm persuaded that what I've committed
[1:14:04] to you you're you will keep it unto the
[1:14:06] day
[1:14:07] that's where my faith lies is what you
[1:14:10] promised me
[1:14:11] not whether you promise somebody else
[1:14:14] but what you promised me
[1:14:21] sometimes I wonder if we know what he
[1:14:23] promised us
[1:14:25] well we need a renewing of our mind
[1:14:29] you know when I grew up and this is not
[1:14:32] to make anything
[1:14:34] to nobody but you know I was taught
[1:14:38] I was taught that God did things for
[1:14:40] those who helped themselves
[1:14:45] you know
[1:14:47] if that was the case Jesus Christ
[1:14:49] wouldn't have had to die
[1:14:54] did what nobody could do
[1:14:58] by one man
[1:15:00] sin entered into Humanity but by one
[1:15:04] example of obedience to the word
[1:15:08] Made A Way
[1:15:10] oh I'm so grateful
[1:15:12] that he's the way
[1:15:14] I'm so grateful that there's some seed
[1:15:16] within us that could humble ourselves to
[1:15:19] the word of God and the will of God
[1:15:22] not everybody has this privilege
[1:15:35] brother Branham gives this wonderful
[1:15:36] example about the tadpole in paragraph
[1:15:39] 45 you know you you're transformed from
[1:15:42] from one species to the next you know
[1:15:45] the tadpole it it evolves up
[1:15:49] to the next species the Frog
[1:15:52] and so
[1:15:55] in 47 he says renew your mind the things
[1:15:59] that you once thought to be precious
[1:16:03] lay that aside and be transformed to
[1:16:06] something else
[1:16:07] what you was one time what you are now
[1:16:11] you know that's a great encouragement
[1:16:13] you know I I'll stop here for a moment
[1:16:16] and just give a testimony
[1:16:21] I love testimonies because testimony is
[1:16:24] not what I do for God it's what God's
[1:16:25] done for me
[1:16:29] you know I
[1:16:32] the Lord has been so gracious and when I
[1:16:36] was a young person in high school I
[1:16:38] I wasn't taught the way of the Lord I
[1:16:41] I had a conscience what was right and I
[1:16:44] went against it and so I paid I paid the
[1:16:47] consequence you know the scripture says
[1:16:50] you know you'll reap what you sow
[1:16:53] so I knew there was things I wasn't
[1:16:56] doing right and so
[1:16:58] I was associated with the people that we
[1:17:02] ended up getting into a bad situation
[1:17:04] and a car wreck and I ended up becoming
[1:17:06] permanently injured in my back and um
[1:17:11] you know they call it you know broken
[1:17:13] back I fractured out L5 S1 a herniated
[1:17:16] disc in my neck and I was you know I had
[1:17:19] to hope you know not I'm not a very
[1:17:22] smart person from the standpoint of book
[1:17:24] smart and you know being able to read
[1:17:27] and write and all that kind of stuff so
[1:17:29] I really didn't put too much of my
[1:17:31] future towards
[1:17:33] um education but
[1:17:36] I put it towards Sports you know I was a
[1:17:38] golfer and I played baseball well when I
[1:17:41] was in you know
[1:17:43] found myself in a car wreck and now I
[1:17:46] realize that I'm all busted up and they
[1:17:48] you know they told me hey this is your
[1:17:51] future is is not going to involve that
[1:17:54] and so it was a it was a crushing blow
[1:17:57] and so it sent me into you know hey my
[1:18:01] mom told me if you're sick go to the
[1:18:02] doctor and do what they say so that
[1:18:04] sounded good enough so I went and did
[1:18:05] what he said or did what she said and
[1:18:07] the doctors they prescribed medication
[1:18:09] they gave me you know Vicodin they gave
[1:18:12] me all these anti-depressants the muscle
[1:18:15] relax you know they just did what the
[1:18:16] book told them to do this is the
[1:18:18] condition do this this is the way to
[1:18:20] treat this condition and so I was always
[1:18:22] told and it felt like a death sentence
[1:18:24] it felt like a prison sentence you'll
[1:18:27] have this condition there's no cure for
[1:18:29] it it's permanent
[1:18:34] you know for somebody who had great
[1:18:36] Ambitions and goals and really wanted to
[1:18:40] have a happy future that was a crushing
[1:18:42] blow
[1:18:45] and yet
[1:18:47] you know I I was in that condition for
[1:18:50] years
[1:18:53] suffering
[1:18:55] under that bondage well I just got to
[1:18:58] take some more medicine and when that
[1:19:00] didn't work I just had to add a little
[1:19:01] alcohol and a little bit of this and a
[1:19:03] little bit of that hey
[1:19:06] I'm I'm I gotta cope with this that's
[1:19:09] what they told me you just have to deal
[1:19:10] with it
[1:19:11] okay okay
[1:19:14] but there's something on the inside
[1:19:16] that was crying out
[1:19:19] there was something on the inside that
[1:19:22] had power to transform me from what I
[1:19:25] was
[1:19:26] to what he wanted
[1:19:28] amen I'm so grateful for that because
[1:19:31] you know you go so long in a condition
[1:19:36] and you finally just say I've had enough
[1:19:41] I've had enough I've got to have God
[1:19:46] so I'm
[1:19:48] I'm in that condition and you know
[1:19:52] by the grace of God you know we
[1:19:55] we suffered more
[1:19:57] you know it went from bad to worse
[1:20:01] you know contracted meningitis
[1:20:03] many many years later and
[1:20:07] you know God knows how to
[1:20:09] get to where we we're in a position
[1:20:12] where it's business
[1:20:14] this business or his death
[1:20:18] and there I was
[1:20:20] and said you know
[1:20:22] I gotta have a conference
[1:20:26] and uh you know from my heart I just
[1:20:28] said Lord you know if you'll let me live
[1:20:30] and you'll heal me of this condition
[1:20:33] I'll serve you no more arguments
[1:20:35] you talk about a renewing of the Mind
[1:20:38] see that's where I believe God wants us
[1:20:40] to surrender all of what the old man has
[1:20:44] to do in it
[1:20:45] I didn't do nothing to earn what God has
[1:20:48] given me
[1:20:50] it is a free gift salvation is a free
[1:20:54] gift
[1:20:55] the seed that he planted and all its
[1:20:58] attributes has nothing to do with our
[1:20:59] Humanity it has everything to do with
[1:21:02] the plan of God
[1:21:04] and I'm so grateful that I was there and
[1:21:07] I came to that broken place where I got
[1:21:09] to have God
[1:21:10] and if if God doesn't show up well
[1:21:13] there's something that was just
[1:21:16] I've made peace with God I'm you know
[1:21:18] what this is not anybody else's fault
[1:21:22] I made decisions
[1:21:26] I was given account
[1:21:28] you know what if your mercy doesn't come
[1:21:31] here in this condition I'm a goner
[1:21:36] that's that's the way every day should
[1:21:38] be
[1:21:40] huh have we gotten to where we've taken
[1:21:43] the grace and mercy of God for granted
[1:21:52] I'm sitting there and the Lord allows me
[1:21:54] to live and
[1:21:56] you know
[1:21:57] by his grace couple months after that I
[1:21:59] met a man he introduced the message to
[1:22:01] me
[1:22:03] and all of a sudden that which was
[1:22:05] longing in the heart the victory over
[1:22:08] sin the victory over the old man it
[1:22:11] became a reality through God's provided
[1:22:14] Channel
[1:22:16] God sent a prophet
[1:22:18] with Supernatural Vindication of his
[1:22:21] presence
[1:22:22] you know this is a sign of judgment
[1:22:25] this is Mercy
[1:22:27] God came he broke the bonds
[1:22:31] uh you know I had I had an experience
[1:22:34] with the Lord I was going to a
[1:22:36] non-denominational but I didn't have the
[1:22:38] victory I still played
[1:22:40] I was still plagued with with lustful
[1:22:43] thoughts and and
[1:22:45] pride of life and I was still plagued
[1:22:47] with doing little besetting things but
[1:22:50] praise God this message is the pure word
[1:22:52] of God to transform us
[1:22:56] to change us into Sons and Daughters of
[1:22:59] God
[1:23:00] not to be the old man patched up but to
[1:23:03] be a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:23:08] and I'm so grateful because
[1:23:12] you know the Lord
[1:23:14] through a brother introduced me to our
[1:23:17] pastor
[1:23:18] and it's just what I had need of you
[1:23:20] know God loves to do things for his
[1:23:22] children he I called him on a Friday I
[1:23:24] got his number I called him on the
[1:23:25] Friday he was doing a remodel you know
[1:23:27] the Tran the the the the the contrast
[1:23:30] the the pastor over there at the mega
[1:23:32] church you know they were flaunting two
[1:23:34] million dollar you know earrings and you
[1:23:36] know all of the flare and all the fluff
[1:23:39] and here is this man of God like that
[1:23:43] man probably never had to work a day in
[1:23:45] his life and here is just a common man
[1:23:48] amongst this he he just like was said he
[1:23:50] smelling like the Sheep he was out doing
[1:23:52] sheep things
[1:23:54] he was just working
[1:23:56] he's not trying to make a name for
[1:23:58] himself he's just serving God what's
[1:24:01] next in front of me what's next
[1:24:05] I heard and oh come on yeah come on by
[1:24:08] and so you know here started attending
[1:24:11] the fellowship and
[1:24:13] you know my brother Tom Ray came preach
[1:24:15] and I was in the meeting and the Lord
[1:24:17] supernaturally healed my body
[1:24:19] it's it was a wonderful thing and I'm
[1:24:22] still reaping the benefits
[1:24:25] I tell you I used to walk with the stoop
[1:24:28] and I was afraid to straighten up
[1:24:29] because it felt like a knife
[1:24:32] but God's mercy has touched me and
[1:24:34] restored me God has come with a word of
[1:24:38] restoration if there's complexes if
[1:24:41] there's plaguing things in your mind God
[1:24:43] is here to restore by the renewing in
[1:24:46] the washing of the water of God's word
[1:24:48] to your heart
[1:24:55] you know I
[1:24:57] I think this is
[1:24:59] interesting how
[1:25:01] I got to
[1:25:03] feel the
[1:25:05] healing virtue of God and oh my you know
[1:25:09] your carnal mind is real near
[1:25:12] and so all of a sudden that thing
[1:25:13] started kind of working back
[1:25:15] and telling me well you know you could
[1:25:18] redeem all of those years
[1:25:20] of your lost potential
[1:25:23] oh I grabbed a hold of that and I
[1:25:25] started you know they said hey I talked
[1:25:28] with somebody who's in the know about
[1:25:29] baseball and I was like you know he's
[1:25:31] like if you if you're three times a week
[1:25:34] you need to run three miles a day you
[1:25:37] need to build up your cardio you need to
[1:25:39] practice this you need to keep your
[1:25:40] pitches down you need to get ahead of
[1:25:42] the account all this stuff
[1:25:46] you know that might sound really
[1:25:50] silly for somebody who wanted to be 31
[1:25:52] years old go back into baseball even if
[1:25:55] it was just minor league or whatever
[1:25:56] just to see just to see
[1:25:59] but you you type that out in your world
[1:26:01] what is what is he tempt what is the
[1:26:04] devil through your carnal mind tempting
[1:26:06] you to chase after
[1:26:08] here I was
[1:26:10] like yeah you know what
[1:26:12] I can testify of the healing virtue you
[1:26:16] could see what see you know your carnal
[1:26:19] mind will compare even like Moses he
[1:26:20] failed but you know or whatever
[1:26:23] you know sometimes when we're driven on
[1:26:25] our own will we'll justify it any old
[1:26:28] way we even quote scriptures we'll quote
[1:26:30] the prophet
[1:26:33] but let's keep the word pure and let it
[1:26:35] be pure in our heart to manifest Christ
[1:26:37] amen and so here I was
[1:26:41] I'm starting to really tune up and
[1:26:44] by this time my wife had you know
[1:26:46] started
[1:26:48] coming to the fellowship and
[1:26:51] I um
[1:26:52] I was missing Church you know the games
[1:26:55] were being on Sunday and Wednesday and I
[1:26:57] was I was kind of
[1:27:00] I was thinking you know it won't always
[1:27:02] be like this you know I'm just it's just
[1:27:05] Four Season they'll they'll all see I'll
[1:27:08] be Vindicated they'll all see it was
[1:27:10] actually for the Lord you know this is
[1:27:12] subconscious I'm not telling nobody this
[1:27:14] but this is the carnal mind
[1:27:16] you have a carnal mind
[1:27:19] I'm just here on the altar sharing my
[1:27:21] heart with you but you battle this every
[1:27:23] day he's come in tempting you telling
[1:27:26] you all kinds of nonsense hey do this be
[1:27:28] this you'll be this all this
[1:27:31] no sir I will be what God spoke me to be
[1:27:37] oh I I got into that thing after a while
[1:27:40] feeling bad but I was doing good and so
[1:27:42] I was like you know it came down to the
[1:27:44] show time where I was going to do a
[1:27:46] tryout
[1:27:47] and you know this
[1:27:49] this is the grace of God
[1:27:51] he just said you
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:57] that's about as quiet as it was for a
[1:27:59] few days
[1:28:02] but the reality came and I laid it down
[1:28:06] if you're doing something because of
[1:28:08] your carnal mind lay it down
[1:28:12] lay it down
[1:28:14] God wants to manifest himself through
[1:28:18] you he's manifest himself to you
[1:28:22] he's manifested himself for you now he
[1:28:25] wants to take you
[1:28:27] and manifest himself through you
[1:28:31] he has the power to transform what you
[1:28:36] are
[1:28:37] to what he said you will be
[1:28:40] ain't that wonderful
[1:28:42] we just always want to check our motive
[1:28:44] and our objective
[1:28:45] you know when we make decisions we're
[1:28:48] influenced by spirits
[1:28:50] but I don't want to be influenced by no
[1:28:52] other Spirit but the Holy Spirit I don't
[1:28:55] want nothing to have dominion over my
[1:28:58] mind
[1:28:59] except the Living Word of God
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:08] thank you
[1:29:12] I have no way to know what time it is
[1:29:17] well you're enjoying the word of the
[1:29:18] Lord
[1:29:20] I'm so thankful that God is faithful
[1:29:22] because what he planted in each one of
[1:29:26] us is going to come to a fruitation
[1:29:30] you know so all of that you're longing
[1:29:32] for if you'll just do like the scripture
[1:29:35] says
[1:29:36] be not conformed to this world
[1:29:39] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:29:42] your mind
[1:29:44] I believe that's a wonderful thing to
[1:29:46] the Lord because he stands waiting and
[1:29:49] willing to impart himself into our lives
[1:29:53] into our circumstances where we're
[1:29:56] having trouble at work with our boss or
[1:29:59] where we're having trouble with that
[1:30:01] school mate where we're having trouble
[1:30:03] with the neighbor who always drives his
[1:30:05] car over our yard to park his car or
[1:30:08] with the children that won't pick up the
[1:30:11] dirty clothes
[1:30:13] God's even in the little things God's
[1:30:15] wanting to come and he's wanting to
[1:30:18] transform the situation
[1:30:20] but if we can take a promised word of
[1:30:22] God the scripture admonishes us and says
[1:30:25] by these exceedingly great and precious
[1:30:27] promises are we going to be partakers of
[1:30:31] divine nature
[1:30:33] what a what a promised what people a
[1:30:37] Heritage he's he's loose that
[1:30:41] amen it was for you and Jesus Christ
[1:30:43] paid the price he's loosed there was
[1:30:47] someone that had a hold on that to where
[1:30:49] you couldn't redeem that Birthright you
[1:30:54] had a right to a land
[1:30:56] he struck that off
[1:30:58] and you can be all that God said you
[1:31:00] were to be
[1:31:02] I'm so grateful for that
[1:31:09] praise the Lord you know I didn't get to
[1:31:12] what I was trying to get to but Lord
[1:31:14] knows you know the power of
[1:31:16] transformation is is in the word of God
[1:31:19] you know when he sowed deceived he said
[1:31:21] let everything bring forth and see
[1:31:24] everything was in that order
[1:31:26] and because God is God he's a Creator
[1:31:30] and he creates by a spoken word it must
[1:31:33] come to pass because he spoke it
[1:31:36] it's just that simple
[1:31:39] but
[1:31:40] the devil has sown corruption in the
[1:31:43] minds of man to where now even his
[1:31:47] thoughts
[1:31:48] we become
[1:31:51] spokesmans
[1:31:54] we become repeaters
[1:31:57] of you know his theme his agenda
[1:32:03] you know haste we want your opinion on
[1:32:06] this I get this all the time you know
[1:32:09] about this next candidate for for
[1:32:10] whatever hey we want your vote
[1:32:14] you see the devil came
[1:32:18] to to to to to to
[1:32:19] pervert see to deform brother Branham
[1:32:23] lays this down really plainly see the
[1:32:26] corrupter came and deformed the seed of
[1:32:29] God
[1:32:30] how did he do it it's striking he says
[1:32:34] he did it through education
[1:32:37] through civilization
[1:32:39] through science
[1:32:41] so now as we're living in this world
[1:32:45] whether we're from Congo or Africa or or
[1:32:48] Mexico or wherever there's certain
[1:32:51] things in culture and Science and all of
[1:32:54] these things we've identified those as
[1:32:57] Who We Are
[1:32:59] but we need to be renewed in the spirit
[1:33:01] of our mind let go of that so that we
[1:33:05] can be identified with the Life of
[1:33:07] Christ amen
[1:33:11] you know he took he took and said
[1:33:14] you know let there be this let there be
[1:33:17] this and and the world was in darkness
[1:33:20] and
[1:33:22] he transformed that chaos and that
[1:33:26] Darkness
[1:33:28] into a Garden of Eden
[1:33:30] amen
[1:33:32] isn't that a part beautiful parallel
[1:33:35] of your life my life
[1:33:39] you know the light of God shown our
[1:33:41] pathway we receive that light
[1:33:44] amen then you become the light amen
[1:33:47] to be a beautiful garden
[1:33:52] let the light let there be light and the
[1:33:55] mass of creation out there there came
[1:33:58] over around the Sun and began to revolve
[1:34:01] around the Sun and became a Garden of
[1:34:04] Eden because it obeyed the word of God
[1:34:07] it done the perfect will of God
[1:34:10] for it was transformed from chaos into a
[1:34:12] Garden of Eden by the word of God
[1:34:16] amen
[1:34:19] you know I'll just
[1:34:35] you know this is a quote from paragraph
[1:34:39] 81 he says when when God had spoken it
[1:34:42] he knowed his word was a seed
[1:34:45] and it could it would bring forth of its
[1:34:48] kind now it's it was commanded to bring
[1:34:52] forth after its kind
[1:34:54] and it will always do it if man don't
[1:34:57] tamper with it
[1:35:00] and so will God's church and everything
[1:35:02] else bring forth of the kind like it was
[1:35:05] at the first if theologians don't tamper
[1:35:09] with it with that word
[1:35:11] trying to put it somewhere else or
[1:35:14] something else God has spoken it and no
[1:35:17] matter how much they can they try to
[1:35:20] contaminate it
[1:35:21] and tamper it and so forth it's going to
[1:35:24] bring forth of its kind there's nothing
[1:35:26] to stop it
[1:35:28] amen
[1:35:31] amen
[1:35:40] he says this in paragraph 94 I think
[1:35:42] this is very important so
[1:35:45] he says oh I would like to stop here for
[1:35:48] just a minute to say this is where we
[1:35:51] are facing yet the completion of that
[1:35:53] word
[1:35:54] I like to know what we're facing
[1:35:56] I mean you you talk about someone who
[1:35:58] could just not just see what the eye can
[1:36:01] see but you're talking about someone who
[1:36:03] can see past time
[1:36:06] he says now I want to stop here a minute
[1:36:09] there's something that we're facing now
[1:36:11] the completion of that word
[1:36:13] now God said let there be and hear it
[1:36:16] come up first perfectly just exactly now
[1:36:20] this tree can only bring forth of that
[1:36:22] that tree this tree only can bring forth
[1:36:25] this tree and Adam a Son of God can only
[1:36:27] bring forth the Son of God you get what
[1:36:30] I mean it's everything like after its
[1:36:33] kind and so God could say well I'll just
[1:36:36] rest now
[1:36:37] and did you notice it was very few words
[1:36:41] that God ever spoke actually from that
[1:36:44] time on he committed it after the Fall
[1:36:47] To His prophets and they bring forth the
[1:36:49] word now you see God rested he didn't
[1:36:52] have no more to do he just had a
[1:36:56] headquarters and knocked at the door and
[1:36:58] he says father what is it and he sent
[1:37:00] the word by them
[1:37:03] down by them and that's
[1:37:06] and he has a system and a way of doing
[1:37:08] things
[1:37:09] let it be just and that's the way it was
[1:37:13] everything
[1:37:15] and of its seed bringing forth of its
[1:37:19] kind now when everything looks so pretty
[1:37:22] and everything come to pass just like
[1:37:25] God had said now here comes the slimy
[1:37:29] dirty
[1:37:30] Deceiver
[1:37:32] now that's what I'm trying to warn you
[1:37:36] all hear about
[1:37:37] when you see God's seed
[1:37:40] beginning to take hold to grow how many
[1:37:43] seas the seed of God beginning to take
[1:37:46] hold and grow
[1:37:47] I'm not just talking about as a
[1:37:49] congregation I'm talking about in your
[1:37:51] individual lives this is not just don't
[1:37:54] don't let the devil just say push it off
[1:37:56] to your neighbor but how is he the the
[1:37:58] the enemy trying to do this in our lives
[1:38:01] amen but the prophet is warning us as we
[1:38:04] begin to to see the the seed begin to
[1:38:07] take hold to grow watch out for that
[1:38:10] fella coming he's slick as he can be
[1:38:13] he'll quote scripture just to who would
[1:38:16] have it see watch him because he is a
[1:38:19] Deceiver
[1:38:21] I'm going to call him instead of a
[1:38:24] conformer being conformed he is a
[1:38:27] deformer you're deforming the things
[1:38:29] that has been conformed he is a deformer
[1:38:32] and he a deformer and perverter or a
[1:38:36] corrupter of the Original Seed in the
[1:38:39] original program
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:43] you know I just see that
[1:38:45] he's warning us you know there's going
[1:38:48] to come a time you know you you get it
[1:38:51] on both sides you get fanaticism that
[1:38:54] they wanted to worship the the idol of
[1:38:57] the Prophet Daniel you see and there's
[1:39:00] they said look
[1:39:01] we're going to worship God we're not
[1:39:04] going to worship these idols and there's
[1:39:06] people lifting up the image of the
[1:39:09] prophet
[1:39:10] right
[1:39:13] but see there's God has a system and his
[1:39:16] provided way
[1:39:18] is so that there would be one a prophet
[1:39:21] go knock on the headquarters give thus
[1:39:24] and thus and bring it down
[1:39:27] and that's the food for the seed amen
[1:39:32] so if they start steering away from
[1:39:36] the the system which God brings life to
[1:39:40] the seed we need to take heed
[1:39:44] and not just
[1:39:46] you know
[1:39:47] Wednesday and Sunday can you imagine if
[1:39:52] you met with somebody and you're like
[1:39:54] man I haven't eaten since since
[1:39:56] Wednesday and you're like man Sunday
[1:39:59] comes I had Nate said Sunday
[1:40:02] you're like ebl anemic
[1:40:05] you see and I think a lot of the health
[1:40:07] conditions in the world today
[1:40:09] is not so much that they're not eating
[1:40:12] but they're not building themselves up
[1:40:14] in the vitamins the pure word vitamins
[1:40:17] the the original instead of all this
[1:40:20] hybrid stuff
[1:40:21] you know we have a carnal mind that we
[1:40:23] have to starve out you know hey a little
[1:40:27] bit of news you know a little bit of
[1:40:30] knowledge about this product or that
[1:40:32] product it doesn't hurt
[1:40:34] you know what I say if we're feeding
[1:40:38] if the majority of our free time is
[1:40:40] feeding and in love then we're
[1:40:42] recognizing we're coming in Union with
[1:40:45] another nature
[1:40:47] otherwise it's time to check up
[1:40:50] the nature that's God's planted in you
[1:40:53] will thirst I cannot be satisfied with
[1:40:56] nothing else but the literal life of
[1:40:58] Jesus Christ manifested in me
[1:41:02] doing the same thing he did
[1:41:05] when someone came mocking
[1:41:10] hold my bees
[1:41:12] spitting on him
[1:41:17] these are not just examples that we can
[1:41:20] look at and not our head and say yeah
[1:41:22] but these are potentials
[1:41:29] I don't want to miss an opportunity
[1:41:32] you know sometimes God is wanting to use
[1:41:34] you in the hardest people
[1:41:40] oh my goodness then
[1:41:42] that's the one you want me to
[1:41:46] get underneath
[1:41:49] God he thought it not robbery he humbled
[1:41:53] himself
[1:41:55] no one can get that low
[1:41:57] the Creator
[1:41:59] stooped way down
[1:42:01] for me and you
[1:42:03] that ought to give us courage
[1:42:06] I can do all things through Christ Jesus
[1:42:08] who strengthens me
[1:42:16] I don't mean to keep you I just I wanted
[1:42:18] to get
[1:42:19] to this last thing and
[1:42:23] maybe we can invite the musicians
[1:42:35] to be able to commune with Christ oh
[1:42:39] what a privilege
[1:42:40] you know
[1:42:42] the scripture says there and John
[1:42:45] chapter 13.
[1:42:47] you know because God was doing something
[1:42:48] for Peter and
[1:42:50] he was even telling him you don't know
[1:42:51] what I'm doing
[1:42:53] and there's been some training there's
[1:42:55] been a lot of God training you and you
[1:42:57] didn't know what he was doing in your
[1:42:59] life but he's been doing something
[1:43:02] he's been transforming you
[1:43:05] when you go and you go to prayer and you
[1:43:07] listen to those quotes and you read your
[1:43:09] Bible
[1:43:10] it might not seem like very much as
[1:43:14] materializing right before your eyes
[1:43:16] but God's faithful
[1:43:20] he says this he says Peter said
[1:43:23] in verse 9 he says Simon Peter said unto
[1:43:28] him Lord
[1:43:29] not my feet only but my hands in my head
[1:43:32] and Jesus said he that is washed needeth
[1:43:36] not saved to be washed his feet but is
[1:43:40] clean every wit and ye are clean but not
[1:43:43] all for he knew who should betray him
[1:43:45] therefore said he you're not all clean
[1:43:48] and he taken His Garment and set down
[1:43:52] again and he said unto them know ye what
[1:43:56] I have done to you
[1:43:58] do you know what God has done to you
[1:44:03] could you could you tell somebody what
[1:44:05] God has done to you
[1:44:08] I mean
[1:44:10] if you can understand what I'm saying
[1:44:13] now you're not too young
[1:44:15] if God has done something for you
[1:44:19] think about that
[1:44:21] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:44:24] well for so I am if I then your Lord and
[1:44:28] Master have washed your feet
[1:44:31] ye ought to wash one another's feet
[1:44:34] for I have given you an example that you
[1:44:37] should do as I have done to you
[1:44:41] you know God has a purpose in doing the
[1:44:44] things that he's done for you
[1:44:47] you go through experiences and the grace
[1:44:50] of God is there you were bound you were
[1:44:53] in shackles and he loosed you
[1:44:57] what I've done to you do unto others
[1:45:02] if someone's done you wrong when you're
[1:45:05] driving home from work you're tired you
[1:45:07] had a bad day they cut you off
[1:45:10] well how many times you cut God off in
[1:45:12] your life
[1:45:15] someone said bad things about you how
[1:45:17] many times you said some bad things
[1:45:18] about God or his plan in your life or
[1:45:21] his program
[1:45:23] Healing Hearts from sin and you're like
[1:45:27] but what God has done to you do unto
[1:45:29] others
[1:45:30] amen
[1:45:32] you have that potential you don't have
[1:45:35] to fear because what he's done to you
[1:45:37] he's actually with you to do it for
[1:45:40] others
[1:45:41] aren't you grateful for that
[1:45:44] why don't we stand

[1:47:43] to renew your mind to transform you by
[1:47:47] his promises
