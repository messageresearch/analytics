Description:
Have Faith In What You Are
Br. Matthew McGeary
May 8, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

our faith [Music] certainly lord we want to move past the realms of man past the carnal mind knowing many of us are tired and maybe had a challenging day or a challenging weekend or a challenging week lord we find ourselves gathered together again together lord we're asking that you would come that the time that we would spend here would be fruitful lord i know many times as we press the battle and we come to our post of duty [Music] many times the rigor of the battle weighs upon us and sometimes we show up and don't even have expectations and that's sometimes just part of putting one foot in front of the other but lord we made it here and now the songs of zion have been sung and your presence is amongst us lord pray that our heart could start to turn lord and to open up to know that you have more that you'd like to say to us lord we rejoice in the word that we heard this morning how it thrills our soul lord to know that we were with you before the world was ever formed what a victory that revelation gives the believer to know that nothing can stop us in this journey now lord as we're here this evening we commit ourselves to you father pray that you'd come and break the bread of life as only you can bless your people now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen praise the lord if you have your bibles we'll be reading out of mark chapter 11. amen i sure enjoyed the service this morning what a what a service you can certainly have victory and rejoice in mark 11 verse verse 20 is where we'd like to start reading mark 11 verse 20 would read and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and peter calling to remember it saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curseth is withered away and jesus answered it and said unto him have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whatsoever shall whosoever shall say into this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive your trespasses amen you may be seated and we just want to start to we pulling from this text here as brother branham would use this mark 11 verse 20 he would preach perfect faith and also he would preach i believe he preached perfect faith there in august 63 and then in november he would preach he that is in you and use this text as well but i just want to bring your attention to to how jesus is saying here in the scripture he says that whosoever shall say to this mountain and notice what he says that he says and shall not doubt in his heart so he's speaking to the individual that whosoever shall say to this mouth and be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe those things which he saith so then he's pointing this is something the individual's doing this is something that the believer he is now saying that now the believer is going to come into a place or to a position to where actually he can speak the word but if there is no doubt in his heart that if he speaks those things he shall have them and i just want to say this scripture reminds me of restoration because when he when he says that there there is no doubt in your heart if there's no doubt well i want to tell you that what man could have no doubt in his heart but yet that word would come and restore that heart back to perfection because that's exactly what we're sitting under is a message of restoration to restore the heart back to the original faith and so when i look at this scripture here and he's saying oh if you don't have any doubt in your heart but you believe what you're saying oh it just speaks a a restoration to me because to think here once there was a man who was on the earth adam was able to stand there he had power and authority and he had dominion over the earth and he didn't have to go to jesus or go to christ the logos go to god or maybe when they walked in they eaten there he didn't have to ask him oh oh should i do this or can i but no he was he was a miniature messiah he had full complete dominion over the earth and he could just speak the word and his word was just as good as god's word he didn't have to ask for permission and he could speak the word and there was no doubt or unbelief in adam's heart because he knew that his word was just as good as god's word and so he could speak that word and he could stand there in an expectation waiting for that to materialize because there was no doubt or unbelief but i want to say oh my for us uh it would seem just even in our faith as we would claim to be a believer and we would say oh thank god he delivered me god set me free you know the devil's right there to challenge you on that he he's trying to to bring doubt into your heart and to try to make you question your own testimony does anybody know what i'm talking about have you ever got victor in your life and god has done something for you or you've made a proclamation and you you've declared the word of god but it seems that the devil's right there to challenge you on the very word that you've proclaimed and try to discourage you from that word that you've spoken but i want to say as a believer you stay right there standing upon the word of god that that unbelief don't come into your heart because that's what the adversary is there to do is to try to make you doubt your experience to try to doubt what you've claimed to try to make you doubt your testimony no doubt many people have already stood up before the church and they've testified of the work that god done in your life and already you've gone back out and you've found maybe you've fallen short in a few areas the devil wants to use those missteps and he wants to use those areas where you have fallen and you've committed sin and he wants to use that as ammunition against you to start to tear down your faith and try to take away your faith in the word to show you that you really don't have what you thought you had but remember you didn't choose god god chose you this isn't something that you have done this is something that god has god done and he didn't save you to lose you god didn't give you an experience he didn't let you feel his presence he didn't do something for you that he would just let you go and then let you figure it out on his own but this is a work that god has started in you and if god has started the work i want to tell you god is going to finish that work and he's bringing you to a place of perfect faith he's bringing you into a place of adoption he's bringing you to a place to where he can start to mold you and shape you and train you up into that position to where you can stand where you can see the example in the word that just as he stood and said it is written it is written and he would not doubt the very word that he spoke he's bringing a bright church into the maturity in the end time that they'll know where they're standing that they have the mind of christ they have thus said the word and they can stand right there and speak the word and there has to be no doubt or unbelief that's going to enter in there why because their womb is sealed oh thank you jesus thank you jesus that's something he did that's something that god has done for the believer but i marvel at this place in in the scripture here because you know as the disciples were uh this takes place right after palm sunday it's about a week before uh the resurrection and and and the disciples they're going to jerusalem and and jesus looked at the fig tree and and he would have gotten fruit from it but he cursed it he cursed the fig tree because it wasn't bearing any fruit and and as they're passing back by the next day that's when the disciples look at his little master uh look look at the fruit tree it's withering away and it's dying you know i marvel at this because what what what the disciples saw in the natural here they're marveling about here stands a man upon the earth that that where he can curse life and the life will go from and it'll be dead here stands a man upon the earth he can raise the dead he can open the blind eyes here's one standing upon the earth again with full authority and full dominion and i just marvel because here those disciples are standing there and they might wonder what purpose is this why would he curse this fig tree why why why why would it die but you know they could only see there into the natural but you know there was a great spiritual type laying there because there was a curse upon israel because they did not receive the messiah and they were going to hang them on a roman tree and crucify him and the very god that they claimed to serve they killed them they were cursed people and you know the fig tree is a type of israel when the son of man came and he was manifested there oh it was a type there in the natural the disciples could only see that in the natural but there was a great spiritual type there because oh that that that nation was dying of death there they were cursed because they were rejecting the very life of the word but i marvel i was fellowshipper with with cosmic struck me you know under that son of man ministry it's amazing to me that that the disciples saw that in the natural but there was such a spiritual type laying there and it wasn't until the son of man came again in the end time that we saw the spiritual type of israel putting forth its bloods the fig tree coming back home and being a nation showing what time that we're living in oh i tell you look up your redemption draw with nigh we're at the door the rapture is at hand there's something that's happening there's something that's turned i tell you if you ain't ready if you haven't put your wedding down on uh get ready it's it's going home time and things are happening at a breakneck pace uh you just see all the the talk about uh nuclear warfare and and it just seems like they just put out another news notice that russia said look we got bombs everywhere that can destroy everything in 30 minutes well that sounds familiar to me i think a prophet done said that several times back in the 40s 50s and 60s doesn't surprise the bride we're just like right on time we're safe in his wings we're protected that's where we want to be this evening and i just want to tell you that what i'm speaking along the lines is is i want to speak uh tonight on have faith and what you are you got to have faith in what you are and i just really enjoyed the sermon this morning about predestination you know god has a purpose for your life and that purpose is because of who you are amen that's where god has a purpose for your life he came to save you he came to redeem you not just half hazard i'll pick one here or there but god has a purpose for you look i i i i chose my wife and i married her not just because she was a girl no she had a character there was something about her that struck and it identified the character in me and so there was that attraction something took place and that's why i chose her and i asked her to marry me and that's why i give her the gifts that i give her because she's my wife because i chose to look look god has chosen a bride and god has prepared something special for you he has a purpose that he wants to accomplish in your life he's he's given gifts to the church and you're heir to these things that god has given the devil wants to rob you from it the devil wants to rob you from the gifts and the very things that god has given to the church and we just lay around and just wonder well i is it for me you know by your stripes i'm healed or you know the holy ghost and should i have power can i lay hands on the sick shall they recover you know should i have joy unspeakable and full of glory in my life and i see these other people with victory and we lay around like like it's something that we don't know for sure but i want to tell you if it's in the word it's for you it's your identification of what happens with the devil wants to rob you from the gifts that god has poured out upon the church but i want to say there has to be a people who recognize who they are that know who they are and say that's mine i'm going to claim it i'm going to put all my faith and all my strength behind this word because i know it's for me oh praise his name paul would say in romans 8 15 he'd say for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father the spirit beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together we're joint heirs we are children of god i know i know we say these things a lot but i tell you what i can't hear it enough you can't tell me i'm predestinated too much you can't tell me i'm a child or a daughter of god too much you can't tell me all the benefits that lay in the word look you can't tell me i love hearing about it and i need to hear it because there's plenty of stuff out there telling me it's not for me there's plenty of stuff out there telling me i'm not a son of god there's plenty of stuff out there telling me not i'm not pre-destination look we're in this little bag of bones this sticky nature and we have missteps and we do things that we're disappointed in and it's right there to stare us right back in the face so you think you have the holy ghost you think you're a child of god you think you got the victory you would have never done those things and if you start to give heir to those things what uh you start to give ear to those things what does it start to do it starts to allow that doubt to try to creep into your heart but look we're standing there as mature sons and daughters of god that we're going to tell that old devil shut your mouth i'm not listening to your nonsense i'm going to say what the word says if he said i'm predestinated i'm predestinated if he said i'm more than a conqueror i'm more than a conqueror if he said i'm sinless then i'm sinless if he said there is there not for no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus then what about it church what are we going to do are we going to take sides with the word are we going to keep listening to those things the devil keeps throwing at us i want to say that you are what the word says you are you are what the word says you you are it's because of who you are look you have certain rights and privileges as a son and daughter of god and it's not because you want it it wasn't a lottery and you picked the right numbers and one day he said i'm the bride of jesus christ i just happened to walk into the right church i just happened to do the right thing and i won the lottery that's not how it works but you you are heir to it because of who you are there are certain privileges and rights that you have as a son and daughter of god i mean how many kids here how many kids do we have here under the age of 15 where are they at i see kids under the age of 15 that aren't raising their hands come on raise your hands kids oh yes that's right we got some kids that are under 15. now how many of you after church are going to ask your parents if you can go home with them none of you now probably a lot of you will because i said it you don't have to think like that why because that's your mommy and your daddy they've provided a home you're their son you're their daughter you're heir to it you see the car there when it's time to go home you go get in the car and you go home when you wake up and it's time to eat you see breakfast on the table you know that breakfast is for you you don't have to go well i wonder who that's for you know who that's for sit on down and start eating it if you don't like the broccoli and the vegetables eat it too it's for you and i and i think so many times as sons and daughters of god we want to question and ask permission for the very thing that god has given to you and he's on the other end begging you to take it look it's for you that's why i died that's why i went to calvary that's why i took your place on calvary that's why i took your sin and i bore him upon your back because i was wanting full restoration i was wanting a bride without spot without wrinkle that would stand in the evil day with full confidence that would stand with the boldness in the face of the enemy and tell him look i am the virtuous daughter of jesus christ you can't do anything to hurt me you can laugh me to score and you can make fun of me the way i dress you can tell me i don't have any friends you can tell me i go to a crazy church you can tell me my family's crazy i don't care what you say because i'm heir to all my lord jesus christ has purchased for me but we need to go into the storehouse and start packing it out we need to start bringing it home we need to keep quit quit wondering if we're worthy he said you're worthy look you were so worthy that he climbed a hill called galgotha and took every single one of your sins past present and future every single one of them and died for you i think i've shared this story before i was witnessing to a man one time and and and and and i just brought him down to the place of now accepting the sacrifice of jesus christ for all of his wrongs and he said i can't do it i said why can't you do he goes because i don't deserve it i i couldn't i i don't deserve to take that and it's just about that time i saw his uh his young daughter she must have been maybe just starting to drive maybe uh 17 years old and she'd come out of the house and go in the car i'm like now i want to ask you something would you lay down your life for your daughter no not even a question and i said now i want to ask you what would you do if your daughter committed a fence but you went to the courthouse and you said you know what i'm going to stand in the place for my daughter and i am going to lay down my life and i am going to die and you laid down your life and you paid the penalty for your daughter's offense could you imagine your daughter standing there and saying nope i can't accept that i'm not worthy of it i did the crime i do the time look so many times the devil wants to play tricks with your mind like you got to do some penance now look you reap what you sow but i'm telling you that if you have repented of your sins and you pled the blood of jesus christ we ain't catholics around here we don't need to whip you over the back and have you crawl on your knees and gromble up here on the altar for two and a half hours wondering if god's forgiven you god forgave you you know i know god forgave you because he said so hey it's not a sin question he took the sin question and he answered it when he spread forth his arms and calvary and said it is finished oh glory to god if there's somebody here that's under the sound of my voice tonight and the sin question is floating over your head i pray tonight that it's settled once and for all that when he spread his arms he thought of you you were on his mind in every sin every iniquity everything that you've ever done he spread forth his arms for you are his son you are his daughter and he said it is finished so now every redemptive blessing is yours well go ahead the price has been paid don't stop now you've already accepted forgiveness for your sin well the purchase of calvary wasn't just to forgive you for your sin it's called redemption because we're going back to something we're going back to where we were with him in the beginning back before there was sin back to the perfect picture back to that image god had of you in his mind in the very beginning and because that thought is an eternal thought as we drop down here in the hickey of time nothing in this little space of time can stop you from getting back to that perfect picture because eternity eternity can never pass away look you can no more die than god can die yeah we've said it before and maybe we've chalked it up where it's just common head knowledge now let me say it again you can no more die than god can die that should be something we chew on for a little bit first john 5 would say 5 4 would say for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith for whosoever is born of god overcometh the world well when were you born of god when were you born of god or am i going to go through and say well you know it was that day brother branham said every birth is a mess and oh i was i was born again on the only reason you can be born again is because you're the elect of god so all you're doing is manifesting the predestination is that what we heard this morning because you are a son and daughter of god because there was a perfect image of you in the very beginning that is the only reason you're able to be reborn is because there was a perfect image that said that you are going to be redeemed you're going to be forgiven you're going to be born again you're going to experience all of my attributes and when you have played out that part of the great drama i'm going to pull you right back to me where you were in the beginning as if you never did it in the first place and that's the revelation that strikes the bride that's come to the bride in the end time the true revelation of justification is that you never did it in the first place if you ever catch a revelation of true justification it sets you free it produces a victory in the camp to know that all of the sins and all of your past though you did them you never did them in the first place oh my call me a crazy man call me a lunatic but i can stare that devil right back in the face and tell him i'm sinless you wonder why people get excited when they get born again you wonder why people i have an experience of the holy ghost when they go through prayer lines and they go to camp and they feel the presence of god come upon them because all of that burden of sin they've been packing around their whole life could you imagine if i had all these chains wrapped around me and everything and and i was just walking around and and everybody was looking at me like what's wrong with you what are you doing like what are you talking about those chains all that those locks and all that weights and everything that you're carrying around like what are you talking about this is normal this is who i am that's what the unbeliever or if i will say like this that's what the son and daughter of god is going through while they're living in that stage of spiritual amnesia because they don't know who they are but what the message has come to do is to reveal you who you are and in the plan of god in the season and the hour that you're coming into manifestation and when that starts to break upon the believer and those shackles and those chains start to fall off of you all of a sudden you feel so light oh does anybody know what i'm talking about when that burden of sin starts to drop off of you and you feel weightless you feel so free you feel like you can fly you feel like you can run you feel like you can dance and all of a sudden those things that you feel you start to do it you start to dance you start to shout why because you're experiencing something that's real i'm not a slave anymore i'm not in bondage anymore i don't have to go back to the way things were oh sure you might experience that deliverance and you go home okay maybe you're in a place of justification or sanctification maybe you do slip up maybe you do fall down again we'll have this i have the experience again repent get right with god get back to the place go back to where you left him and let the grace of god be revealed to you okay lord i i didn't pass the test so lord i'm coming back i'm repenting of my sins lord i'm praying for the holy ghost that you seal me that you feel me that when the test comes again lord i'm i'm prepared now i'm armed i'm ready with one hand on the sword like the wall of nehemiah they had one hand on the sword in one hand they were working that's how we want to be as christians we want to have one hand on the sword we want to be working we want to be building the church of god we want to be building up the family of god we want to be fighting for our brothers and fighting for our sisters but we want to have our hand cleaved to that sword when that devil shows up we draw the sword there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus i can do all things through jesus christ that strengthens me i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me in the life that i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son i get back devil we're in a spiritual warfare and the prophet of god in the opening statements in perfect faith forgot to look at the clock again so i i'll only be 45 minutes from this point at least i don't know how long i've been prophet of god would say this in perfect faith he said now faith is based on forgiveness we could preach there for a while faith is based on forgiveness it starts there with repentance what is the formula to receive in the holy ghost repent if you have truly repented of your sins and you have received the forgiveness and received a pardon i think it's extremely difficult for you to hold sins to hold a grudge against a brother when somebody does you wrong when i it's just to me it's it's a very difficult thing to hold a grudge i i don't know about you maybe you'd be justified but it'll drive me nuts i i can't i can't live like that like i i am i i am i i just i i want to talk about it right away my brother david's the worst about it he he'll he'll he'll he he might get he might do something to to to to to to just you know like really and and he's just like five seconds it's already gone like it never happened you're like wait a second we gotta have some time to like be mad but you're taking this too far here this not have a grudge and just put it in the past thing you can't just slap me like hey man we're all forgiven right we're good but really there should be a love in our heart that no matter what our brother or sister does to offend us there ought to be an ability if you've ever experienced the grace of god if you've ever experienced this love oh if you've ever been pulled out of a mucking mire if you've ever been pulled out of sin if you've ever been forgiven if i can get a little bit more volume on the on the monitors oh if you've ever been forgiven then when you when you see somebody else that's offended or needs forgiveness there's something inside you there's a life in you that just wants to pour out and forgive because it's the life of christ that's in you so if you ever find yourself holding a grudge you need to check up in your heart you need to make that and the scripture says never let the sun go down upon your wrath that always spoke to me that don't let those things don't let the sun go down uh without making things right just the the prophet of god would say this did i even read it we're trying to get somewhere faith is based on forgiveness then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us i try to slow down and reading this maybe i i'll uh let me try the handheld y'all can probably hear me uh perfect out there but i'm a challenge so i apologize i can hear myself now so brother random saying here in perfect faith he says now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger now if the prophet of god is saying this in 1963 after the seals have been broke and august 25th he's saying trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us that's what we all hunger i want to say there's something in my heart that is hungering for apostolic times and he says it's just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want to see such a flow that it will help us and flow out to others now watch this he says now he says remember jesus as we had the lesson this morning he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent for now we know that eternal life is living for others and right here we're reading the prophet of god saying remember jesus he never used his powers for others uh for himself he used it for others that's what it was sent forth sent forth so i want to speak along these lines that's where we're wanting to move to where we see apostolic times where our faith is not always on the defensive well we're not just trying to keep our borders and we're just trying to to keep the devil away from us and we're just trying to keep a patch up job and we're just trying to keep the enemy from coming in like a flood and and the flood waters are coming all up around us and we're trying to pack sandbags over here and over here like oh man i let the bar down back over here and we're running back and forth and we're like in a sinking ship and we got a bucket of water we're constantly trying to stay afloat that's not where we want to be at you know there's an old saying i believe george washington said it he said the best defense is a good offense and we don't want to just always be sitting on the defensive side that every time the devil tries to come and attack us that we're just there with our shield and trying to weather the storms but we want to get to the place to where we're moving out and we're expanding our borders and we're going after loved ones we're going we're taking the word of faith down the road and we're accomplishing things and we're expanding our borders just as our brother andrew was just sharing his heart that there should be a faith and an ability in the pride of jesus christ that could stand in the gap knowing who she is that we can stand there and say oh god i'm asking you why because of who i am and i know you hear my prayer because of who i am i'm coming to you lord and you said if i ask anything in your name that you would do it then we could stand right there with a faith and a confidence speaking the word and asking the word and then standing and waiting for that word to be manifested well that's eternal life is living for others the prophet of god said jesus never used the power for himself he said he used it for others he said that's what it was sent for then i'll ask you what is the holy ghost sent for is it not the same life then what was the holy ghost sent forth it's not to just use for yourself so many times we just create a safe haven i'm an overcomer now you know what i'm able to make it to church three times a week i mean i i got everything in check i've i've i've found things that are lawful they're not expedient but you can't say anything against it i got my little sports i i got my my uh uh what do they call those there's some word for uh i'll call it vanity sports something they got some type of sports where you pick all these players what do they call that fantasy like i said vanity sports so you know but you got all these things that we can spend our time and we kind of carve out a little comfortable niche and we're believers you know and i got enough holy ghost to keep the devil off of me i'm living a victorious life you know i'm not addicted to the things i used to be addicted to anymore and and you know when the devil comes around you know i i'm not caught up in all those things that's not what the holy ghost was sent for the holy ghost was sent that not that you would use the power for yourself but that you'd use that power for others well it makes me think of abraham there in in genesis 14 14 what happened when when he found out that his brother lot had been taken lord was abraham was able to stand there and say you know what i am going after lot though my brother's backslidden no he's been pulled out there in the world i am going to go after my brother regardless of the cost you realize that all's he had was was his hired men servants i think you think about 300 men and he beat his plows and and beat shears into swords and and went after armies now you would think that abraham didn't have much of a chance but who was abraham see abraham knew who he was and i got to thinking about that a little bit because god had made a promise to abraham and so abraham knew that god gave me a promise and that he said i will bless your seed and i will multiply thy seed and i know who i am and i've walked the borders i've seen the borders so i'm going to go after my brother and i can go after him in the face of death and no matter what the devil can't destroy me and i'll say this even more maybe abraham was going after him and going that way and maybe his men servant started to question him and said abraham what are you going to do if god if you die on this journey say well god i have to raise me up again because he promised me that my seed shall possess the land shall possess the gate of my enemy so you think that's something walks me out of the battlefield if i die i'm going to get right back up because god said that i'm going to bring forth the promised son and nothing can stop the promise of god i want to tell you god has made you a promise and there ain't nothing that can stop you live or die i don't care what difference does it make if you don't go in the rapture on this side you're going to go in the rapture on the other side so i say why don't you draw your sword why don't you go after your brothers why don't you go after your sisters why don't you go after a lot and those prodigal ones why don't you beat your uh plows and the shears on the source and go after lost loved ones what do you got to fear church you gotta fear your reputation you gotta fear your big standings within the local community and i am this on the hoa and if i witness to to to to mr so-and-so then i'm gonna get kicked off the board well you need to get kicked off the board because they should know what you believe already yeah i think sometimes that's my rule of thumb if i stand around and talk to somebody and i give them two or three minutes to tell me about their story well they need at least hear my story sometimes we just sit around and somebody starts to talk and they just they tell you oh this is where i'm from and this is what we're doing and this is our plan and they just go on and preach their little gospel and their world and everything they're all doing and you let them ramble on for five or ten minutes about something that's gonna burn and then we're so spiritual we say oh that's wonderful well nice to meet you really come on now oh brother matthew we need dupes deep supernatural things uh yeah yeah this is deep supernatural things because this is the test this is the proving ground if the life of the holy ghost is in you because it's a life that's living for others there has to be something inside of you that's looking for the opportunity you're looking for the window you're waiting for the weather you're waiting for something you're waiting where's my window where's my entrance where's my opportunity how do i tie this together how do i loop this in how do i get the message how do i get this to christ what where am i looking for lord i'm watching i'm waiting how are you going to turn this is this is this a seed of you lord there needs to be an expectation something in your heart that's looking for the supernatural to unfold look we're supernatural people we're we abraham was was was manifesting the predestinated plan of god and that's something we got to realize is that each day that we're living out we're living out the predestinated plan of god and and that's his will that's his word and he's wanting us to come to a place of maturity where that word is in our heart and we're not just sitting around wondering what if what if but we're going out and we're expanding our borders we're taking the word out in the field and we're winning victories oh god help us to win to have a victorious life like that god's made you a promise but i wonder many times we don't act like it right you know god's god's made you a promise we're going in a body change we're going in a rapture but i think that's the challenge is to act like it on a daily basis you know it reminds me of that little story about the ranch girl where where the uh the the big owner of the ranch sent his son on down he was he was looking for a wife and you know he he didn't like all all the the girls with all their dress up and everything but he found that girl with real the wash girl was throwing out the the wash water he found real character in her he said you know i'm coming back this next time next year to marry you and he made a promise to her and all those girls you know they made fun of her they said what are you talking about you think the boss's daughter the the owner of the armory son would he would have anything to do with a low life like you but regardless of all of the insults regardless of how they carried on with their fancy parties and and their big hoop laws and everything that they were doing this young girl started making preparation she started making plans that she was getting ready you want to know what that looks like well there's a couple girls in our church that are getting married sister grace and sister janet just talked to him for five or ten minutes ask them how they're doing and what they're doing and where they're going you'll know real quick because why they they have made preparations they've made plans all of their life and everything that they've been looking forward to if i could stay that way everything that's been built up oh they're in such great expectation you can't help but just talk to them a little while so what are you doing now where are you what are you doing next week well they're going to tell you right away i'm getting married oh you're getting married what day are they i've hit six days and and 30 minutes and 28 seconds we're gonna say i do why because what happens you start to see something in their life start to line up with their confession oh trust me uh their job knows about it their friends know about it they they they've sent message books i mean rsvp's to all of their friends and family they've let everybody know they've come in contact with say look i'm going in the rapture i just want you to know on this date next friday i'm going to tell you if you come looking for me i'm gonna be gone you ain't gonna find me why because my heavenly bridegroom has come there's an invisible union going on and i just want to take a little time and tell you that if you look for me you ain't gonna find me why because he's already split the eastern sky he's on his way and i'm getting my wedding garment on to meet him in the air oh i think there ought to be a bride rising up in the end time that's all you can talk about that's all you can think about when you come in contact with the neighbor when you come in contact with the boss you want to give them an rsvp invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride read that a little bit it'll tell you what i'm thinking about it'll tell you what i'm what i'm talking about oh we got to have a life that starts to line up with what we're talking about a confession but a life that follows up the confession and trust me you think i'm lying go look for grace next saturday won't be here she'll be gone and i'm telling you that's a good natural point to make because there's going to be a lot of people one day they're going to look around oh glory to god i'm getting excited now why because i've already heard my eliezer he's already come and he said look that's isaac that's your bridegroom out there on the field why don't you go out there to meet him and he unveiled the mighty god unveiled before us he introduced me to christ the word my mate and i'm now coming to a union with him and i'm just waiting to be caught away i'm just waiting for the change of my body oh god has made you a promise just like he made abraham a promise oh my i love that story about abraham because god god made sure that the bride wasn't left out sarah was part of that promise so what was it there in the plains of memory melchizedek come walking up and says where's your wife and he discerned the thoughts and intents of sarah's heart and said according to the time of life you shall have a son that's the same thing that's happened to the bride of jesus christ the son of man has come he's discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart and i believe it's that spoken word of melchizedek of the son of man that is producing a faith for the bride to receive strength to go into a rapture and into a body change look you got to feed on this bodywork son of man that's going to be the thing that changes your body it's not going to come any other way oh what great promises that we have now notice here brother branham is saying in this opening quote he says in the morning service he says i'm trying to get the church into a place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us i want to say that if you really want to see what apostolic times look like just open up your bible and start reading acts chapter 2. what did the prophet say he said if if the if it ever puts forth another branch if the vine ever puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts he said as long as god is still sending god called men with the word of life the apostolic age is still on well you want to know you you want to know what a book of acts looks like well get your pen out and start writing what do you think happened easter camp weekend uh is there somebody not that knows what i'm talking about there's somebody here that's been delivered as there's somebody here that's been set free is there somebody here that's been filled with the holy ghost is there somebody here that was warring and wrestling with demons and you couldn't get the victory but god rich and mercy he came and he cast those devils off of your life and he set you free that the victory bell could ring and you can say i'm free at last free at last oh does anybody know what i'm talking about oh my we just let a couple weeks go by and we we just get back mellowed down and we forget what's really happened i think it's good to be reminded what god's done for us i think it's good to let that that that fire will back up in us and to remind ourselves of what god did when the prophet of god is trying to bring us to something he's saying look i i'm wanting to get the church to a place where we can really see apostolic times moving among us again how many wants to see that how many of us are believing for that well praise god trying to figure how long i've been up here so brother branham preaches how can i overcome in the morning of august 25th 1963 and then he's going to preach perfect faith that evening and many times as i'm studying i like to look at uh uh many times how brother branham will preach a morning service and an evening service and and how they they dovetail together so so wonderfully and brother branham says this he says now so if we're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ see because if it don't you lay around and you know that these things you're supposed to do and you don't do it the bible said he know he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sinned now that doesn't mean he he that knoweth not to sin but to do good look if god has put something on your heart to do and you don't do it now we're talking about maturity we're talking about doing those things that we know to do that are right we're not talking about you know oh you that keep sinning and you know not to sin you know that sin well that's no that's not what we're saying here he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him but sin then you become doty rotten when you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing now you know this just reminds me and maybe we'll find a place to end along these lines but this reminds me of the story in in samuel where david in 2nd samuel 11 1 it says you know this is the time when kings went forth to battle and there uh uh david he had sent uh his his general uh joab down to fight and i i believe uh uh uh they had destroyed the ammonites and they were there in that area but the scripture says this was a time when kings went to battle and i just think that's such a profound statement because here you would think if this is a time when kings went to war here was the most mightiest king the world had ever ever seen was king david but you know he had sent his armies off down the road and it was during that time that that david had went off on the terrace there and he went out and he was looking over the wall and there that's when he saw the beautiful bathsheba and the prophet of god said it was david's passions that got him in trouble because maybe a time as he was saying if you know if you those things you know to do and you don't do it you lay around and you get dody and you get rotten and i just wonder here david just to think that here his armies were off to war and here he's enjoying the comforts of his palace and he comes out there and he sees this beautiful woman there and he goes to inquire of her and he finds out that she's a married woman but something had happened to david to where he had gotten cold he had gotten dodie oh i mean you think of all the psalms that he had written and all of the joys of the lord and him being his strength and and here he's come to a place where he's oh god's done so much in his life he's delivered him out of so many trouble he's preserved his life he's given them the kingdom he's given everything he ever had need of here he has over 500 wives but yeah his passions here he's who is that woman bring her to me and so they bring her to david and he lays with her and he goes back and they find out she's with child and all of a sudden david what does he want to do oh my goodness all right i need to cover up my mistakes i'll go go get uriah bring them home and then i'm going to try to make up some type of story just try to cover up my mistake you know when you start to try to cover up your mistakes and your failures you just make it worse david would have been a lot better if you'd have just repented right then and a lot of us would be a lot better and i look i know you've made some bad decisions i know you've even made some bad decisions in the last week or two just make it right stop letting the devil make it seem like it's an impossible situation and that covering it up is gonna make it go away it's just gonna get worse the sooner you come back to god the sooner you expose the devil the sooner you're going to have victory in your life that you can go on with god so david calls uriah back and he says oh uh you're uh how goes the battle he's like oh we're doing good jobs up the great general we're winning the battle the men are doing good we're healthy we're strong he goes okay well why why don't you go home to your to your wife and and why don't you just go home and and why don't you spend the night there a couple nights and and then maybe i'll send you back out in the battle and job looks at king david says my lord the ark of the covenant's out in the battlefield and my general joab's out there fighting and the ark of the lord is an open tense and the man are scattered across the ground going to war how could i go to the comforts of my home how could i go to the comforts of my bed and lay with my wife when the ark of the covenant is out in the battleground could you imagine the reproach david was feeling being the the the the man of war that david was being the mighty warrior that david was and how many times he had he had fought and how many times he was victorious oh i feel like david was feeling even more helpless and he's like oh my oh all right okay uriah and your eye just slept out there at the wall didn't even go home and then the next day he tried to course him into going back home and he wouldn't do it so guess what he had to develop another plan well if that cover-up tactic didn't work maybe i'll just have to come up with another tactic oh my so god's speaking to somebody because so many times we want to try to cover our sins and cover our mistakes and cover our failures if we'll just come clean and make it right and go on with god you'll save yourself a lot of problems but what did david do he decided that oh you know what i'm going to do now i i'm going to send him back with a letter and i'm going to kill him i'm going to have the men withdrawalman here you know uriah was a mighty man of valor you know you know you know uriah was a gentile warrior he was a prostitute to the faith of israel he was a gentile and i think you know it's one of the men out of all the men in the bible it's one of the men i believe brother better said when i get to heaven i want to shake his hand and he's the only if you look into he he's he's one of the only if you look at the lineage it actually mentions uriah in the lineage of christ instead of bathsheba well it mentions uriah the the husband of bathsheba in the lineage christ god recognizing uriah why there was something in uriah that that that there was a life something that god saw that was honorable that he protected his name to think that here he was oh if the ark of the covenant if the spirit of god is out there on the battlefield i'm not gonna go to the comforts of my home what a rebuke to david who is out there on the terrace wall and he was getting dody and rotten and he was indulging in his passions oh come on come on saints we we got we got uh brothers and sisters in our church that are fighting battles there's ones amongst us that are sick there's ones about through amongst us going through great trial they're separated families there's wives that that that if you only knew the cries of their heart with what they're going through and their agony and their torment they cry out to god just to make it another day because they're so heartbroken and we sit out on our terrace wall playing our video games and saying bless god i'm the bride of jesus christ i'm talking about passions what what what is it oh it might be lawful but is it expedient what did we say that the holy spirit was given what not for yourself it's given for others so if we're going to broaden our borders then we've got to take the life take the victory that god gave you a camp clean up your life clean up your home clean up your dress clean up your attitude get grounded in the word of god get grounded in the message oh so many times you you have an experience at camp and it just seems like that right one's right there to distract you from feeding on the word well let me preach a little bit yeah i've seen it one too many times you have an experience at camp and all of a sudden you're you're the perfect candidate to get married well i had an experience at camp have you met sister so-and-so say really you don't even have a testimony yet back at you i mean you testified but now let your confession take on action let me see your life for a little bit let me see you dig into the word let me see the fruit uh that you be fruit bearing that you're not dody or rotten and laying around let me see you become a man when i become a man i put away childish things and you want to run off and get married and entertain some girls emotions shame on you son of god you ought to get right stand on the word of god say you know i'm not ready i'm not eligible to get married because i need to put my roots down in the word i need to get a great revelation of what those seven seals are i need to get a revelation of what this message is really about let me dig in let me get around the brothers that have been doing this for a little while let me go visit the widows let me go visit the sick and afflicted let me take this word out let me broaden my borders and broaden my boundaries and then come talk to me after a year or two i know what i'm talking about i've been there and i've seen it and i want to tell you that little twitter page that you're entertaining is just a distraction from you and your lord you think that that's just perfect timing that you find why are we going here you think it's just perfect timing that you just finally had an experience and here's the most beautiful girl you ever saw in your life two days later okay maybe she is the right one if she's the right one put it on pause for a year or two and then you'll find out when she's done ran off and married somebody else is she the right one now nope you'll change your thinking real quick oh don't look at me like a mule staring at a new gate i know what i'm talking about i've been around a little bit i've seen it and if god really did a work in your life something inside of your heart would say you know what god's speaking to me right now i'm not going to lay around and get dodie i'm not going to lay around and get rotten i'm going to let the let the passions take me away from my lord i'm going to put my roots down in the word of god i'm going to get for real i'm going to come to the men's breakfast i'm going to feed on that tape and i'm going to come with a hearted expectation and i'm going to let the brothers know hey brothers this quote right here number 68 it's just burning and eating me up did you hear what the prophet said i want to see something like that in our young man because when god does something real in your heart you can't help but talk about it you killed something just it's eating you up if you ever felt like i tell every brother in here raise their hand you sit around you'll sit around and every every time there's an opportunity and you're sitting on your hands because you don't want to do all the talking because you know if you open your mouth it's going to be hard to shut it up we look we learn by god's grace we learn control and we learn wisdom and we learn to let our elders talk and we we we we work these things out you know by god's grace but there should be something inside of you and we want to see that in you young people and your young men and you young sisters we want to see you broaden your boundaries we want you to go out and start winning souls that's what it's like i'm just going to call the musicians because that's one way to start getting towards the clothes is anybody can somebody say amen to what we're trying to say that's what got david in trouble a time when kings would go to war and so brother branham in that morning service he would preach how can i overcome and and you know the prophet of god would say what does it mean to overcome it means to recognize the devil in all of his tricks you know david would say many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord you don't have to start playing yet i'm not done preaching it's just a reminder that i need to be done preaching psalms 34 19 says many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all and i was just thinking about this you know some of our afflictions are self-inflicted some of our afflictions are self-inflicted you know better what was it jackson that brother burley said he said i don't mind you making mistakes just make new ones can somebody say amen see it's okay to make mistakes make new ones because you're gonna come against the test again and that's how you know that you're an overcomer is when the same test or trial comes and then you overcome and you say you know thank god last time i didn't overcome that now you know the devil's going to go back and regroup it's like all right well we didn't get him on on it that way so let's change up the game plan a little bit but if we're just laying around like hey all right well you know what i resisted the devil and he fleed so what do y'all guys want to do tonight are we going to you know we're going to play games are we going to do this are we going to do that no when you get that victory go back into prayer go back into the bible do something now i'm not trying to say you got to be like a robot and you can't have any fun and we can't have any recreation you know brother i i endorse recreation i enjoy it i think it's needed i i believe it's it's a part of a healthy diet of a healthy church is to spend time together and have fellowship and fun and and be a family it's many times in in those types of events to where where god can use the body to minister to one to another and maybe you see somebody carrying on a certain way or dress in a certain way and and you can come up and you'll put your arm around and say you know hey a brother you know there's a there's a better better way to do that and then you see oh there's a little growth and like oh thank thank thanks for for you know i didn't realize i you know i didn't want to that would be an embarrassment and if i didn't know and so many times that's that's what the body's for there should be a maturity and a growth and looking out for one another that we can we can have fun we can do things together but we do it as christians we don't we it's not like we we're not allowed to do we can't have no fun we can't do anything together we can't go anywhere wait you know we it was like we should just institute the covet rule amongst us everybody's six feet apart don't want cooties right or christians we can act like christians we're a body we're looking out for one another if we see somebody conducting themselves then what does it say the elders teach the younger and if i can say this as humbly as i can if maybe i can i can encourage you know you know some of the sisters have been doing this a while uh if you can please help our younger sisters they need help some of you that have been doing this a little while just i know it's hard but they you'll find out that we have such a good group of people and some of them just they just don't know better it might be culture it might be their mom it might be their dad they they might have heard it but they never really it just never struck them and god wants to use you look we're talking about the holy ghost is not given for yourself it's given for others maybe god wants you you're the maybe you're you've been the one saying i wish so and so would do that or i wish they would stop doing this well maybe god wants to use you to be the mouthpiece that'll go to him in love and in prayer and in humility and say lord show me the time show me the way that i can maybe say something to them in love that can win their confidence that they can maybe hear a word of the lord now we're talking about real true christian living yeah maybe you can start playing something now that'll really get me to wind down well y'all pulled me down some roads but by god's grace i just pray that that we when we recognize who we are that god has called us and he's ordained us that that life that he's given us is to live for others but we get ourselves in a lot of trouble but we know we got to recognize the devil in all of his tricks maybe maybe you can play uh uh pour your spirit out on me let's just stand let's skip down here and this this is maybe this quote right here is i could say the crux of my inspiration and perfect faith the prophet of god says speaking of jesus he had faith with his power how did he he said i can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in god who made him the word he was god the word and they was in him and that give him faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this now i want you to listen to this really close and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what god had made him and if he did that then can we rely upon what god made us as believers these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer it just comes to me now there's a story about a miss weber she was there in jeffersonville [Music] and she was sick and they'd been praying for and the angel lord spoke to brother branham and said go tell mr webber i'm going to take miss weber home get their house in order and he's gonna have to care for them four or five kids on his own [Music] so brother branham went down to mr webber and said you know god's taking miss weber home and you can get your house in order that didn't change miss weber's faith she was a believer and about the next day or so some of her co-workers come in they started to talk about brother branham in the church said oh you know there's nothing to that guy he said there's nothing to those that group of people over there it's just a bunch of whoop up and it's just a a lie miss weber looked at her co-workers and she said sister weber i'll call her she said i might be dying i might be on my deathbed but i'm a believer [Music] and i'm not going to stand for it because i'll tell you i've seen the man's life and it's true and everything that he said is true this message is true i wonder if there's something in your heart are you a believer in the face of all obstacles in the face of the scornful and the persecution they're her friend she's on her deathbed but she stood up for truth she said i i'll testify even if i go by the way the great my god the healer [Music] even if i don't ever see the circumstance change my godly healer [Music] and she testified [Music] why because she knew who she was she was a believer the prophet of god said it was about three o'clock in the morning i was woke up i went to get a cup of water i was sitting there in the living room and there come through the door the angel of the lord [Music] he walked up to me and said [Music] miss weber will be at the tabernacle tomorrow she'll be sitting in the back on the right they're going to bring her into church and i want you to tell miss weber i heard what she said i heard what she said about me i heard that she stood up for me and thus saith the lord she will not die why because she was a believer and i say god has gathered together a group of people in bedford texas no matter what the circumstances no matter the trial no matter what you're going through no matter not what it looks like you know who you are you can have faith in what god made you you are a believer oh though the trials come though the tribulations come though the heartache comes though it seems like your family's tore apart though it seems like you don't know how you're gonna make it one more day there's something inside of you that can't stop holding on why because you're a believer [Music] oh why don't you thank god he's made you what you are [Music] it's not because of what you've done it's because of what he's done pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain saturn my thirsty soul come and fall afresh [Music] heal my heart and make me [Music] let's sing that first verse [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] is lord forgive me [Music] you are [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] me [Music] eyes [Music] thirsty [Music] me [Music] and i just want to read this quote here in [Music] closing brother branham says jesus had perfect faith he had it and it come because he was the word now watch what the prophet's about to tie together oh we we can we can accept jesus had perfect faith we can even accept that brother branham had perfect faith but watch this message in simplicity jesus had perfect faith and it come because he was the word and you become the word [Music] you become the word as you receive the word if ye abide in me and my words in you my words which this word abides in you then ask what you will and it will be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you said then you shall have what you said so look all the doubt all the confusion all the struggle all that muck all that mire that god has pulled you up now he's washing you he's cleansing you and as you feed on the message it's not that you're becoming the word in a way that you never were the word but that spiritual all amnesia potential of the word was already put inside of you by that predestinated seed it's just faith cometh by hearing the word and it's the other part of the the chinese laundry ticket the two are just coming together and that gives you the purchasing power to claim what's yours oh isn't god good and now we become anointed with that same spirit anointed messiahs messiahs of the last day to shine forth the resurrection of jesus christ to show that he is not dead but in the form of the holy ghost he's in his people moving among his bride with a love affair to her pouring out into her himself they are becoming one for the wedding supper and the same signs promised by the same god in the same word is making his same manifestations there's nothing left for us to do but believe it and believe it it's substance and that creates a perfect faith heavenly father [Music] lord i thank you for your bride that has gathered together with such great grace and attentiveness to your word lord we know we never take it lightly to stand before your purchased elect pride lord lord would you make up the difference lord just to come and minister to their heart and to take the words that have been spoken and water it lord and grow it that it'd be fruitful maybe simple may be broken up lord but we have faith in who we are knowing that youth the one that's called us and that we're a body that's fitted and joined together and lord we need each one lord the life that you've placed inside of each one here it's for others help us lord to catch that revelation that you want to use us lord to minister to the needs in the body and to the needs in the community so we just commit ourselves to you lord continue to pray strength for our brother billy that gave out of himself lord we pray that you bring our pastor home safely lord we think of uh the wedding coming this week lord just pray traveling mercies for all that are coming lord we just thankful for everything that you're doing lord we love you we commit these people to you as we go in jesus christ's name we pray amen you are dismissed [Music] what give me [Music] draw me lord [Music] draw me lord [Music] here [Music] oh and there's nothing like the presence [Music] oh [Music] presence [Music] is [Music] are you free tonight let's just worship him a little bit that's why you're here [Music] [Music] i've been changed [Music] delivery [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] i won't go back [Music] oh it's all forgiven oh thank you jesus god [Music] right now [Music] [Music] this a moment to come [Music] [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] i'm no longer a slave to fear i am a child of god [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] me [Music] yes [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] welcome [Music] you
