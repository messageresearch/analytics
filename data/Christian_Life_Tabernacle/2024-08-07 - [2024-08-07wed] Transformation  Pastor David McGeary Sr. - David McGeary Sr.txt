Description:
Transformation
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Wednesday Evening Service
August 7, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

their country and brought into the evils of man's greediness and to be treated like they weren't even human beings but one day there was a proclamation that they could go free and at the Sunrise of that great day not everybody could make it to the top of the hill but the one at the top when he saw that sun break from that behind Earth's turning Shadow and he saw that first glimpse of light he said I'm free amen he didn't run off but he passed the ne message down I'm free and the next one said I'm free and I'm free Lord and it's come down all the way to our age father that we're free we thank you for it we ask you to bless us this evening in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you let's open our Bibles too to uh the book of Romans and you know I I really don't like to come to church without a tie but I just couldn't figure out what color to wear with this shirt so and so I decided not to wear one so I was going to put one on but then I can just see lesie saying oh my goodness that don't match you know and then I thought well uh I I thought if I wore a tie that didn't match that wouldn't be forgotten as easy as if I didn't wear a tie at all so that's why we did it we just want to fellowship tonight seems like a this looks like an ice cream crowd to me so um anybody that wants to go get ice cream after service it's a my treat so uh and all you that don't start running to church now all you that are staying home so you can get a free ice cream you love God's word amen just a just a night of fellowship and everything that uh we kind of got uh called out the last night uh for a um kind of the work of the Lord so we went to wakeo last night about 10:00 I guess or so and got in early this morning and uh and uh we were glad we did because God's a good God amen so let's turn to Romans the the 12th chapter and and uh and know want to kind of go down the same lines that we were talking about and and uh um you know it it's it's hard not to get discouraged listening to the news you know what I mean so sometimes you just got to say I'm just not turning it on CU what I don't care what's going on in the world God's got something going on and I know that to be the truth so we just got to stick with but listen this says this I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word amen you may be seated isn't that uh uh a great thing you know to to prove something or is to put it to the test if you could say that that it meets um it it meets its testimony so okay if maybe I that's not the best word I could use but it if someone claim something and then you test it to see if it you prove prove it to see if it is what it says it is and and that's what God wants he wants us to to be transformed that we might uh that we might know what the will of God is for our lives and I got this to thinking on that thought and and uh and this little thought come to me just in fellowship tonight but you know I begin to ask myself how did I get here you know how how did I get here in other words uh uh to transform means to be changed from one thing to another so to get from where that I was to where that I am I had to go through changes to there there's a a a lot of changes a lot of things transpired uh things that I I didn't know would happen and things that caught me by surprise things that were unexpected not only did I go through changes by experiences but I went through through changes just by simply growing and and and having the life that was in me the natural life that was in me begin to transform me you know I mean if I could have chosen uh probably somewhere along the way that I would uh have stopped my progress you know I I have some really fond memories when I was 10 and 11 years old and I started fishing ocean fishing and being out in those boats and catching those fish I mean I just thought that was great and maybe through those few years and then into high school a little bit uh those were great times but I I wasn't able to stay there you I wanted to stay there and if it was given me you you know what I mean uh uh probably even from the natural side you know when I was on the water and my hair was a little longer than it is now and a little more of it and you know and I I was baked by the sun I just thought that was something you know just uh uh that was before the sun caused skin cancer you know what I mean uh and everybody wanted you to be Lily white you know the Browner we could get the better you know and uh and so but I couldn't stop it you understand the very natural light that was in me was created to change created to take me from one place to another and that's what transform means to change from one thing to something else so just when I begin to sit back I begin to look at it in a lot of different ways how did I get to be almost 75 years old you know I mean there had to be a lot of Grace along the way you know a lot of my friends never made it I come up around the Vietnam War and a lot of my senior class I went to war and at we can go to my high school and there's a walk down the high school and there's the people that lost their lives in in the war and of course I I knew those fellas and that that played a big part in my life that war did but I begin to think that something there had to be something I went through changes and so we know the natural types the spiritual we can we can rest assure of that can't we that the natural types that uh the the spiritual and though I may have not liked a lot of things and and and I even you know I tried to alter a few things you know I I wanted to be taller so I used to hang on the bar you know with weights on my feet and uh could do that and I wanted to be bigger here you know what I mean I lifted weights I I wanted to be pumped you know I mean but but I transformed and it it it fell from here to here and and that that happened with with I could say this without my consent you know I mean uh I don't like that that now that number in my closet is half of 80 you know I mean something's wrong with that picture you you know so now I'm trying to do everything I can and it's hard to reverse those processes you know I went and bought the stuff you put on your head you know what I mean that supposed to make it grow and then they you know and at $90 a bottle if it didn't do it the first time budy I wouldn't getting it no more you know so that's that's just uh the process but what what my point of view is is that transformation is a law of God and it it's not something as hard as man tries to do it it's not something that can be reversed first and and it it's it's sort of something that we've almost got to come to the realization of to have understanding to come to the place that you can understand that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord that there's many things that are transpiring all around you and things are changing all around you the world's changing kids it's it it it's falling apart and you know and I you know I'm going through this uh quite the time in my life with my mom but my mom the other day woke up in the night and called lesie in and lesie come in and my mom looked at her and she says the world's falling apart he thought that's the truth you know it's the truth it is it's falling apart you know uh obviously she's going back to those reflective times and things like that so I begin to kind of ask how how did I get here how what brought me here this evening to be standing in in at this desk um without a matching tie speaking to those of you who decided to come out here tonight it happened and somebody was in control of it and and it had a purpose you know and so you know I kind of look at this great well even the process of transformation in my life you know from me being just a a a Catholic a a a a school boy I I my parents were catholic I was born into a Catholic home and my mom was a devout Catholic and my dad was non-religious you know he didn't stop my mom from doing everything but my dad didn't go to church he didn't go to mass he worked and when I had concerned about it my mom told me she says well your dad offers his work up to God and and uh I didn't pursue to uh probe that any further you know I just accepted that that things were that way they were and I went about about my life and and so I was raised a Catholic and I was uh I went to Catholic school and you know I was a an an altar boy and and as we talked a little bit uh last Sunday morning that that whole experience was built on fear you know just a a a fear that uh uh uh you know I might go to the bad place you know and and I I I tried to do everything I could because I I was I I wasn't a angel when I grew up I I had a lot of disorders and I had attention deficit disorder and facial recognition disorder and and I was stubborn and I didn't want to learn and I'd rather be someplace else and school and discipline didn't fit my nature you know the problem is discipline is a part of Christianity and that's why we need a nature change uh but you know so you know I tried to do everything I could to to uh make it to Heaven you know I said prayers I became an altar boy I went to mass I said the rosary I called out on the name of the Lord every time I saw the priest I'd tell them all my sins you know I I I just had this a a fear that was on me that whatever happened and I I I had to go to heaven in fact I I even would dream at night and and consider it that that maybe I could be a martyr you know that I could give my life for the uh my physical Natural Life uh to the for the Catholic church that then I'd be a martyr you know because Martyrs made it to Heaven regardless you know I never knew there was a life given for me you know what I'm saying but but that's the what how I grew up and that's what I came through it and I went to Catholic grade school and then I from Catholic grade school I went to Catholic High School and and then towards the end of my Catholic High School year you know the Vietnam War popped up and you know there was a big you know uh uh we were in California and and there was protest if we' sit down in the evening and and there was protest all over the uh television and so many people died today so many people died today and and and people were dying and nobody knew why and we'd see this all and then there was all this and they had a big of the convention in 1968 uh there was a great big riots and everything and everything was anti-war and everything and my people were getting getting drafted you know what I mean my friends were getting drafted and and and then I got a number to get drafted and that was scary and so I figured right then I'm I'm out of here you know and it just this I I decided that I I would become a hippie you know I so I changed you know almost like you know just the opposite just that I went through a change you know what I'm saying I I dropped out of high school none of this stuff I'm proud of you know I I dropped out of society the best I could I I thought that I would make a living uh making moccasins and sandals and selling little beads on the street corner you know what I mean and and walking around peace and love and you know people would come out tourists would come out of town and they asked me if they could take their picture with me cuz they wanted a picture of a real genuine uh hippie you know cuz uh that was kind of people were looking at a hippie and I say yeah you know and they give me a few dollars you know what I mean so I just kind of work my way around to where tourists are you know what I mean see if they want to get the a hippie picture and but I I I was I went through that time of my life I went through that the the mindsets that I was in right but something had to renew my mind you know I mean like something that took my mind from school uh you know this might be a scary brother James but when they did my aptitude test they said that uh I would make a good pilot I don't think he'd want to be in the cockpit with me you know what I mean but you know so I I had all these things and things that something was changing me you understand that I didn't have control out of I just think of that I'm coming through life my my my physical State's changing my mental State's changing I'm going through changes I'm going through transformation I'm going through things that I like the things that I I don't like you know I eat things today that I would never have eaten as a teenager you you know what I mean just and so you come through this trans you come through this transformation and and you know can then you you know like when I I went through my my hippie stage you know what I mean so then I was into the Zodiac you know what I mean and then I was into numerology and spiritualism and toggo cards and and all these things and every one of those steps was really I was trying to renew my mind renew my mind get a new mindset on life get a new mindset on on the situation I couldn't go for forward with the mindset that I was in with the thought process that I was in could with the with the way that I perceive things and so along with my physical transformation had to come a mental transformation you know and and all of us that have have teenagers you know there's just that magical age you come from that stage where you know everything you know and uh I remember calling my dad one time my dad called me and and lesie answered the phone and my dad said uh where David he says well he's he's got the toilet off of in the bathroom getting a hairbrush out of it that one of the kids flushed down and I could just hear him laughing you know now I'm was going through what he went through you know the the things that transpired so we went through those things and I remember I can remember to this day that when I started uh uh you know I went I was in the drug culture and and you know and I had contacts for drugs and and I part of the way I survived was selling a little bit of drugs and and I think I'm past the statue of limitations I hope but uh um that's just how it was and uh and so we we went through that and I got I got hanging with these guys and and and I remember that night so much in my life you know we had some of the motorcycle gangs in the my house there and and different people from different things and rock musicians and everything and had this party going on and all of a sudden out of the middle of nowhere I became totally overwhelmed and I looked around and I mean it was nothing but pure evil I couldn't believe what I was seeing you know I mean you know I read Romans I didn't read it at that day later on I saw what I in Romans what I read men with wi doing things with unseemingly just just and I remember just I for out of the middle of nowhere I went down I fell on my knees and I said God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this that's all they knew I didn't realize what that was I'd called my folks and said you know I think I'm just going to go ahead and end it all you know or and you know you have thoughts suicidal thoughts and and and you know I don't know nowadays it's kind of popular to have them but don't entertain that kind of stuff because there's Spirits out there that are trying to latch on do it you you know what I mean uh uh when I first come to the message we'd never roll a pair of dice you know what I mean we never I never play a board game with dice because it just there a spirit that goes with it you know what I mean and you know we went to the little spinning wheel or something so we didn't we didn't have to roll them dice you know we had we had all kinds of of of Standards you know that we wanted to hold to because uh we knew the world was coming after us and when we first came to the message you knew the world was coming after you nowadays it doesn't seem like anybody thinks the world's coming after him they think like Satan's uh taking a vacation but he hasn't taken a vacation he's actually changed his form into where he appears as an angel of Light and thinks that he's doing everybody thinks he's doing doing so well and he's destroying M mankind where where people won't even know what it means to get back to family decency he's destroying the family he's he's he's destroying everything that that's Godly if the whole country hardly wants to retain God in its knowledge anymore you can't you can't talk about God they they they they mock it openly I guess like they did at this mocking this last supper uh thing that I I you know I'm almost afraid to watch it but you go through those you know you go through those Transformations so I come from all the way to this place to you know I cried out for God to help me and then I heard a t okay now you know why did I believe you know wh why did what I heard touch me I had no connection with it you understand no upbringing in it no reason to uh I didn't know who the man was I didn't know what he stood for I didn't know anything uh uh about his background his upbringing his ministry or anything I didn't know he prayed for the sick I I didn't know that he fulfilled Malachi 4:5 I didn't know he had a place in the scripture I didn't know anything alls I know was is that I meant the Lord I read Romans chapter 1 I saw it was real and the scriptures just spoke out to me and when I heard that tape and I heard that voice that two voices were similar the effect it had on me was the same effect that it had on me when I read the scripture there was a total dovetail a total Unity but that that and and it it spoke to me I didn't I didn't need it explained I didn't need to know what was happening just like I didn't realize as I grew up that I was transforming it was a transforming event something that was going to cause a change now was going to transform because God's a Transformer he transforms You by Renewing Your Mind by the renewing of your mind I begin to replace fears with the word I begin to place my replace my ambitions with what I thought his will was the best I could so there was a there's a a transformation that takes place there's a law of transformation in God's word a law of change he never brought me to any spot along the road and quit changing me that's why I'm still getting older I don't care how much stuff they have on the Shelf you can eat all of them relief Factor you know what I mean uh you know this stress bug and this and this and that and you can eat them all you know and you're not going to stop it it's a law of God if you live long enough you'll just keep adding time but you'll change you'll change you'll change you'll always change and so we and that's what I just uh God just is is so on my heart is the for us to come to the understanding that we haven't arrived and that's what happened to every denomination and every religion if they got to the place they had their doctrines they had their way of dress they had their teachings and they set up camp they said this is what we believe we've arrived now we're going to continue in our lifestyle for what we do every day we're we're just going to hang on to what we've got and and there there's there's there there's nothing more and you can try to change you can try to stop the transformation process but if you're genuine seed of God you can't you can't you can't stop it it it's it's alive and it's real and and and just as much as we change so you could take your spiritual condition right now I could look at what I am right now for whatever understandings I have Revelations I have and look back 30 years to right when I first became a Christian and I could I could if I had a way if I had some tool that measured that I should have the understanding in my heart that I should be the same distance from where I am now down the road in Greater understanding great greater spiritual St greater discernment greater control of the circumstances a greater understanding what the will of God is for my life but I I'll never do that without the renewing of my mind and if I let my mind become stagnant and then what what it why did he say pray for Revelation Revelation comes to your thinking first and then it drops into your heart and becomes faith it comes to as an understanding and then it drops into your heart can you realizes that it's real and you let it change you you let it pull you you let it transform you and the the hardest thing for us is that is that God wants us to get to the place uh that we could have uh a confidence and and and that he wants to that he wants to make us to understand that he's transforming us to something he wants us to come to the place and sit back and say I'm not I'm not finished he's not finished can I I just when I look at the sheath offering I look at where brother renam was how he handled situation the things he saw the things he spoke the understanding he spoke and he spoke those things that we too might come to that maturity that we too might come to that love that we too might come to that fearlessness of standing with God's word and not being afraid but if we if we get to the place where we're afraid to change and nobody likes to change the older you get the less change you want that's right you know you got places for this and places for that you know what I mean and you get grumpy and you say who Moved My Ruler or I put my stuff I hate it when somebody comes and cleans my desk what happened to my papers I put that paper on top of that dresser for a reason if I can remember why I'll I'll come get it but don't move it don't move this don't move that it's here it's up here for a reason it's over here for a reason it's under this stack for a reason I know it's there somewhere you just don't want any change you don't want you you want to stop the process you hit a spot that you're comfortable you hit a spot that you finally feel good about yourself you finally you finally feel great and I would have stopped it at like I said between 10 and 21 I would have if I that's I felt great I would have stopped it but you can't stop it I've got to come to the realization that there's a transformation taken in me not only is it taking place in me naturally but there's also a transformation and a growth that has got to be taking place within us spiritually our Natures have got to mature our workload our spiritual workload needs to increase lay for yourself a pattern of good works it's got to increase it's got to I I I'll just use the word expand your Gates have got to expand the the the the footsteps of your possession has got to grow a revelation has got to increase he's got it there for us and that's why Satan tries to wrap Us in fear that where we're we're afraid to step out we're afraid to go into the unknown we're afraid to have anything transpire in our thinking or in our nature where we'll be in a place that we've never experienced before we we don't we we we almost get timid but if we can come to the realization praise God this is a part of what that he's doing in his word the seed that he put in me was put in me to transform into what that he wanted it to be and to produce the fruits that he wanted it to be it never was put there to grab a hold of a Theology and a belief it was put there to produce fruit Absol substance of Life character and divine attributes now it's tough when you look in the mirror to think that you could be transformed into the possession of divine attributes our sinful background are flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to another the carnal mind is an enity with God right but we got to say wait a minute this carnal mind is not what binds me it's the seed the power of transformation that's in the seed that's in me I just got to let it move am I got to let it work I can't I can't count myself out right if I look back in my past all the things I said all the things I do Satan would Rob the victory I have right now you don't belong in the Pulpit you don't have no good you're you're grumpy you're old you're withered you got no strength you know come my goodness he's an accuser of the Brethren he'll write a list on you that if you believe it it it'll stop you in your track I don't care what you've done what mistakes you made if your name was written on that Lamb's Book of Life He's Got The Power of transformation in you to overcome every obstacle and your history should not stop you from being what God wants you to be and what you can be in Christ Jesus no wonder he said leave those things which are behind and press for the mark of the higher calling amen be ready to change be ready to be made different so many churches and places that that they get the people and they they get a certain form of conduct and they want to just hold everybody into that line of conduct nobody can leave their spot nobody can leave their place everybody's got their position everybody's got their seat in the church and everybody sings What songs they sing and everything I'll never forget one time somebody come out I was in a meeting and a sister come out and she said that sister sang my song I said I didn't know you wrote that song you should be glad that somebody sung it can you imagine me going up on they sang Amazing Grace that's what my song can you understand what I'm saying if our minds aren't renewed by the stimulation of God's word that we are in a transformation process we're not done transforming we're not done changing he can change us he can make us difference you're not children some of of you are young and you're growing day by day it's marvelous it's marvelous that we can see life in you it lets all of us know that there's youth still there to be had what would you do if Society no more life came right we would know that it was on its path to ending there would be no life no hope no continuation it would be over but now we sit back and we look around us and we say the world's transforming why because everything's a shadow everything's a type there's transformation taking place in us and I just want to close with this is that we can't stop changing okay we're going to we're we're going to go into places we've never been you can't be afraid to step out in faith you can't be afraid to to to to to make a an adjustment if I could use that word in your life or or do something in your life that brings you closer to the kingdom of God you've got to know that it's that it's him that's creating this desire in your heart to be different to change and he can change you you're not stuck you're not stuck with a habit you're not stuck with a weakness you're not stuck with bitterness you're not stuck with with frustration or complexes he's a transforming God he can change you from all all those things he just wants a people that that says Lord I know you can change me I know that we're we're changing I know you want to make me different life's different I want to rise above where I'm at I want to be more like you I I know that's a possibility for me because there's something in me I've watched you take me from the first tape that I've had I've watched all that you've done in my life life and I don't want to sit and build a camp and write a history book I don't want to write a book on what was but I want to have a desire in my heart for what's going to be yes how are you going to use me Lord what door are you open for me who you going to have me pray for who you going to have me witness to I I'm I'm I I'm not going to stay where I'm at I'm moving I'm moving in my soul I'm moving in my spirit and and that's what God does he makes us different that's what transferring to make different than it was to be made different than it was it doesn't mean that what it was was bad why do every time we just think that we got we're transformed from bad to good from bad to good how about from good to better from better to even more better to most better than triple better whatever you know why not good from good to good why why not from doesn't have to be from bitter to sweet but how about from sweet to more loving more caring more giving more awareness of other people's needs less selfishness he's going to take care of you right and and I'm going to read the quote in closing the musicians can come and this is what brother bandam says and it it just really struck me in a special way it says but I'm so glad that God is mindful of us again now now think about it I thought you know that's almost like we've got the prophet warned about us we we feel the message has been given it's all on tape he's he he just listen to it and do what he says and he's just kind of standing back he's got nothing for us to do he's got no more Works he's got no more testifying no more souls to win alls we're doing is camping out but he's mindful of us again he's mindful of the condition he's mindful of the hour you don't think God's mindful of what's going on in our country you don't think he's mindful of the of the persecution and destruction and and mockery and hypocrisy that we're going to be facing every day he's mindful amen amen but what's he going to provide for you to you to get you through it he's going to provide change change of your heart change of your mind change of your attitude things that used to gripe you you'll be able just to say okay I was eing the other day and I ordered something and it didn't come out right and they took it back and and and and you know they take 35 5 minutes I just sat there said I am not going to let this burn me I'm not going to say anything to her when it gets here thank you I'll eat it and I'm not going to do it I thought why I'm changing because I felt like going back there and letting the cook know and let them know how to run that restaurant you know they they needed me forget it here get it turn off the radio use your paper for firewood God's got something for his children you don't have to be afraid of the preacher you don't have to be afraid of the church you don't have to be afraid fear not little flock fear not little flock it's the father good pleasure to give you the kingdom and and and he so he says he says he's still he said God for mindful us of us again that he can still move upon the face of the condition these words are so prophetic so orchestrated by the holy spirit so constructed by the word of God to renew our mind he's mindful of us to move on the condition well when he moves on the condition what is the move going to do change the condition no it's going to transform you the change is taking place in you we're not going to be left here and the world raptures away right we're going it'll stay the same they'll still go to church they'll still be getting saved they'll still be singing songs and the elect will be gone they'll be transformed they'll be changed so he can still move but we we we got to say where's this move at it's in the transforming power that's in the seed to transform it into being what God wanted it to be it's moving it's so great and you didn't have one thing to do about it he put it in you and you can't even stop it from moving Paul didn't believe it he thought he'd persecute the whole church and all of a sudden someone said hey Why persec th me Bo you talk about transformation and he said you know what Paul you're going to know how much you got to suffer for my name's sake and he suffered when it came all down to it he said I fought a good fight I've run a good race now I have one more change I'm going to go receive the crown that's been set for me and then he goes on he says he face the condition he promised he would do it and call a little flock which would be his bride notice here again now how perfectly these Church ages typed these two Edens what was the whole church age it was the transformation of the seed to the image of Christ in the sheath wave offering the god through a seed of his word and there's only one thing that can Quicken the word and that is the spirit for it is the lifegiver to the word it's the transforming power that brings life to the word and when the life in the word meets the life of the spirit is produces whatever the seed is the that transformation is taking place it don't matter I mean how old a difference between me and you about 30 years you don't buy that you know but we're going to change you know from a teenager to a young man you know what I mean kind of hoping you can get me around over at the place you know and uh and working and and and and going through the transformation whatever it is and I'm I want to continue to transform yes because that he's going to meet the condition he's going to bring the word the spirit to strike the word that's in you to produce what what it is that he's saying this message is alive it's real it's un time it was stored up and broke out and fed to us that canot de feed us to gain more theology but it's fed to us to create a change to make us different different than what we were yesterday the different and I I hope that's our hope amen you we join with me in that that the Lord change me I'm not afraid of change I I don't I don't care what tomorrow is I know you've got tomorrow just make me different nobody wants to be different make me different make me different than I am you know just whatever it is Lord It's really my heart's desire is to make me different amen I don't know what time is but let's Stand Together anyway do thank you but [Applause] uh you know who you know who really deserves the Applause you know I don't really I I appreciate that but brother Bram preached so many a sermon he never got one hand clap for he spewed out life and they would be banging their Forks against the glasses and the women would be sneering and mocking and he'd have all those Bob haired women out there at those Full Gospel businessmen pouring his heart to him and they just pick on he never got an applaud one when I tell you we meet him in the air that's when the applaud is going to be you know and and I I hope that even if you're in a a hard time in your life I know what it's like to go through a hard time kind of in one myself maybe you got a whole history of failures there's nothing he can't change CU our whole existence is built on change our natural our spiritual our mental everything in life is transformation don't try to stop it just let it let God transform you let us bow our heads if you have a desire in your heart this evening that it's not that you're disappointed in what that you are it's not that you're not happy and rejoicing and thankful for all that you have but there's just something inside of you that that you just want to be more of whatever that he is or maybe you felt you've never been used by the Lord and you like to say Lord I'd like to be used it would be different for me it would be a change for me but Lord I'd like to be transformed into a vessel set aside for use Lord I want you to draw me just want you to let that transforming power that's in the seed that's in me renew its work in my life it brought me this
