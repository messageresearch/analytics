[1:19:42] gave us their parking lot and they gave
[1:19:45] us their room and we were able to do
[1:19:48] that so
[1:19:49] we wanted to thank all of you it takes
[1:19:52] all of you to to make these things
[1:19:56] possible and and so that's what we're so
[1:20:00] appreciative because it takes just takes
[1:20:03] an effort
[1:20:04] I thought how beautiful it was that our
[1:20:08] sisters from uh some of them from
[1:20:10] Zimbabwe and different countries and
[1:20:13] places and they're all here singing in
[1:20:16] Spanish
[1:20:18] amen that shows there's one thing huh
[1:20:21] yeah there's one God who is the father
[1:20:24] of us all
[1:20:26] right amen and and he he loves us so
[1:20:30] much you know the scripture says in Luke
[1:20:34] it says
[1:20:37] but rather seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:20:40] God and all these things shall be added
[1:20:44] unto you fear not little flock for it is
[1:20:48] your father's good pleasure to give you
[1:20:51] the kingdom
[1:20:53] and this morning I
[1:20:56] believe with all my heart
[1:20:58] that before there ever was a star placed
[1:21:01] in the sky he knew this meeting would be
[1:21:04] here
[1:21:06] and as our brother spoke he sent one of
[1:21:09] those arrows out
[1:21:11] that it would arrive here this morning
[1:21:15] at this time
[1:21:17] to do for you exceedingly and abundantly
[1:21:21] above what you could ask or think
[1:21:24] I believe that if it's the father's good
[1:21:28] pleasure
[1:21:29] to give you and I'll put it in this
[1:21:32] terminology
[1:21:34] so you don't think it's a future tense
[1:21:37] or a past tense but this morning he
[1:21:41] wants to extend
[1:21:43] and share a greater amount of his
[1:21:47] kingdom with you
[1:21:50] and each of us personally if he wants to
[1:21:53] do something that will
[1:21:55] be a special
[1:21:59] for you I don't care where you're from I
[1:22:01] don't care the situation you are in the
[1:22:04] background you're in when I was that
[1:22:06] little hippie boy
[1:22:09] running around with the Hell's Angel
[1:22:11] motorcycle gang and
[1:22:13] and involved in the things that I was
[1:22:16] involved in the rock music scene and all
[1:22:20] those things
[1:22:22] I never would have dreamed that he had a
[1:22:26] message
[1:22:27] that would prepare me for my soon
[1:22:30] Rapture yes sir you know but he was
[1:22:35] mindful of me and he provided everything
[1:22:39] for me all along the way to get me to
[1:22:43] hear
[1:22:45] so I I don't know what's tomorrow holds
[1:22:48] but I know where I am now in this moment
[1:22:53] and so this is the moment that we want
[1:22:56] to take and we want to believe that he
[1:22:59] said wherever two or three are gathered
[1:23:01] together
[1:23:02] that I'll be in your midst
[1:23:05] and that he comes in our midst to do for
[1:23:08] you
[1:23:09] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:23:12] you can ask or think
[1:23:14] it's kind of been requested this morning
[1:23:16] and maybe by the cosmen could come to
[1:23:19] the piano and sister Julia will say I I
[1:23:22] tell sister Julie I said I want you to
[1:23:24] sing my song
[1:23:26] but there's something that made it
[1:23:28] possible
[1:23:30] this morning
[1:23:32] and it's the only place that we have to
[1:23:35] worship
[1:23:37] and it's under that shed blood
[1:23:42] and you might
[1:23:45] look at yourself or look at
[1:23:47] circumstances but remember somebody
[1:23:50] loved you so much
[1:23:52] that they sent their only begotten son
[1:23:57] that
[1:23:58] there could be something that stood
[1:24:00] there
[1:24:02] for you
[1:24:04] this morning
[1:24:06] and that's what we've come this morning
[1:24:11] to set ourselves under
[1:24:14] is to realize that this didn't happen by
[1:24:18] our work
[1:24:19] it happened by sacrifice
[1:24:23] it happened because someone was willing
[1:24:25] to go to the cross and take some nail
[1:24:27] scarred hands
[1:24:28] and that's what we're trusting in this
[1:24:30] morning above all things that you'll
[1:24:34] have faith in the price that he paid for
[1:24:38] you
[1:24:39] that it can do for you even above what
[1:24:44] you ask so before brother Tom comes
[1:24:46] let's just listen this
[1:24:49] Julia sing this and then maybe we can
[1:24:54] join in on the Last Stand Together and
[1:24:57] join in on the last verse as brother Tom
[1:25:00] will come amen
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:14] that paid my way
[1:25:19] death it's
[1:25:21] price
[1:25:23] when it flowed
[1:25:27] down from the cross us my sins were gone
[1:25:36] sin for God

[1:25:57] but in three days

[1:36:31] a few turns in the road and you might
[1:36:34] think that I'm I'm trying to make a
[1:36:37] point about your new building or
[1:36:38] something but I am making a point about
[1:36:41] your new building
[1:36:44] um no I'm not and I I just
[1:36:48] something just stirring in my heart and
[1:36:50] I was studying yesterday morning and
[1:36:53] looked at this scripture and it so went
[1:36:56] in line with where I'd like to go so
[1:36:58] haggai chapter one
[1:37:01] the Bible says in verse 1 in the second
[1:37:06] year of Darius the king in the sixth
[1:37:09] month the first day of the month came
[1:37:11] the word of the Lord
[1:37:14] and we got everybody okay
[1:37:18] okay by hagiai the prophet
[1:37:21] understoodable the son of shatil
[1:37:24] governor
[1:37:25] of Judea and to Joshua the son of Jose
[1:37:30] dick Jose dick the high priest saying
[1:37:33] thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying
[1:37:37] this people say the time has not come
[1:37:41] the time that the Lord's House should be
[1:37:44] built then came the word of the Lord by
[1:37:47] haggai the prophet saying it is time
[1:37:50] for you oh ye to dwell in houses sealed
[1:37:55] with house sealed houses and this house
[1:37:58] is lie waste now therefore thus saith
[1:38:01] the Lord of hosts consider your ways
[1:38:05] now I'm not saying that like I said I'm
[1:38:08] not saying even though that it could
[1:38:10] apply somewhere but I'm not going that
[1:38:13] direction but I would like you to take a
[1:38:15] word because it takes time to consider
[1:38:21] and I'd like to speak on having
[1:38:24] consideration
[1:38:27] that's powerheads Heavenly Father we've
[1:38:29] read your word we pray father that you
[1:38:31] will make your Word Alive make it true
[1:38:35] and real to every heart so we've read
[1:38:38] your word Lord It's Eternal spoken
[1:38:41] and God we just pray that you'll take
[1:38:43] the the substance of it and make it
[1:38:46] alive to every one of us in the name of
[1:38:49] Jesus Christ amen you may have your
[1:38:51] seats
[1:38:57] there's a lot of things that you could
[1:38:59] we could go through in the subject of
[1:39:01] consider or consideration
[1:39:05] and everybody wants to do something on
[1:39:09] the Fly these days
[1:39:11] make a decision on the Fly
[1:39:14] but there's some things that we need to
[1:39:16] realize we have to consider our actions
[1:39:20] because there's going to be a day that
[1:39:22] you're going to be answerable to your
[1:39:24] actions
[1:39:26] and so then before you do something
[1:39:30] because this day and age is a quick age
[1:39:33] things are happening
[1:39:35] and they want you to make a decision
[1:39:36] quickly
[1:39:38] and you make a decision this morning
[1:39:40] whether you want to serve God or not
[1:39:42] I've got quotes if you want you know if
[1:39:45] more of Evangelistic type of service and
[1:39:48] you want to realize if you don't get
[1:39:50] saved you go to hell
[1:39:52] you get saved you go to heaven that's a
[1:39:55] consideration some people fall asleep
[1:39:57] already and want to go home well why are
[1:39:59] you here
[1:40:00] that's my question
[1:40:02] why be here don't hinder the service you
[1:40:06] know it's a consideration you considered
[1:40:08] to come to church
[1:40:09] you said well what am I going to wear to
[1:40:11] come to church I'm going to look
[1:40:13] handsome in this or I'm going to look
[1:40:14] beautiful in this how do you like my tie
[1:40:19] you like that diet
[1:40:21] so I consider I have another tie that I
[1:40:23] like wearing with that so you know you
[1:40:25] make out these
[1:40:26] these thoughts
[1:40:28] you considered you know who you're going
[1:40:31] to marry consider what church you attend
[1:40:33] there's consideration Falls in so many
[1:40:35] categories and and yet we understand
[1:40:38] with these thoughts that we think
[1:40:41] there's also
[1:40:43] a consequence
[1:40:45] that comes with your consideration
[1:40:50] there's always consequence
[1:40:52] well if I do this this happens if I do
[1:40:54] this this happens
[1:40:55] and a lot of people say well you do that
[1:40:57] it's bad and I say well how come maybe
[1:41:01] it might be good
[1:41:03] who are they to tell me on my own
[1:41:05] consideration
[1:41:07] you know I wished maybe a uh Aiken would
[1:41:10] have sat down and talked to somebody
[1:41:12] before he made his decision
[1:41:15] and considered to take us a silly wedge
[1:41:18] of gold and a Babylonian garment
[1:41:21] really
[1:41:23] that was worth the destruction of his
[1:41:26] wife and his children and his cattle and
[1:41:28] his lamb
[1:41:30] so you say well that's a that's a little
[1:41:32] that's a little subject that we could
[1:41:33] touch on and that would be a deep
[1:41:35] subject that we could cover but just
[1:41:38] that little simple Act
[1:41:41] caused a destruction of his family
[1:41:46] so it was deeper than just I think I'll
[1:41:49] grab that or I'll have that and I'll
[1:41:51] hide that under my dent
[1:41:53] consideration
[1:41:56] to consider your ways
[1:41:59] and you say well brother Tom you know
[1:42:02] we're all saved well that's great
[1:42:05] and we're all in the mess that's good
[1:42:08] and and and and how happy I am that you
[1:42:10] have come to that position but let me
[1:42:13] tell you as soon as you leave church
[1:42:15] today you're going to have to consider a
[1:42:17] lot of thoughts
[1:42:20] and so now before I get a little dance
[1:42:23] on the bubble type of thing of
[1:42:24] Hallelujah glory to God we're going to
[1:42:27] come down to a little bit of hey this is
[1:42:30] serious life
[1:42:31] because decisions that you make today
[1:42:34] the prophet said will tell you where you
[1:42:37] will be five years from now
[1:42:41] so that's that's pretty deep
[1:42:43] and then you got College children or
[1:42:46] children that are graduating and they
[1:42:48] want to go to a college and my first
[1:42:51] reaction would be well is there a work
[1:42:53] to there
[1:42:55] is there a church there why would you
[1:42:57] even consider going there
[1:43:00] right so so there there's things that we
[1:43:03] need to just step back a bit
[1:43:05] and consider
[1:43:08] what does God want
[1:43:11] because it's not our will
[1:43:14] but it's God's will
[1:43:17] and but but we're getting so charged to
[1:43:21] make decisions how many how many have a
[1:43:23] smartphone
[1:43:25] oh I know that that was that's
[1:43:26] embarrassing isn't it
[1:43:29] I'm smarter than hey this is not sin and
[1:43:32] it's just how you use it you know
[1:43:34] so we have a smartphone so then you use
[1:43:37] a phone and how many have had a text
[1:43:39] that you have not replied immediately
[1:43:45] and then all of a sudden you get another
[1:43:47] text where are you
[1:43:51] my own time
[1:43:54] right so everybody wants to make a
[1:43:57] decision for you
[1:43:58] hey you want to meet us for lunch well
[1:44:00] maybe I don't want to meet you for lunch
[1:44:02] maybe that's why I'm not answering you
[1:44:08] but you know before it used to be you
[1:44:11] know send a Pony Express
[1:44:13] right you want an answer wait three
[1:44:16] months you get a letter
[1:44:19] but now it's everything's quick on
[1:44:21] demand
[1:44:22] you don't have time really to consider
[1:44:24] the things of life that really matter
[1:44:27] really matter
[1:44:29] and so then as life goes on and
[1:44:32] Technology speeds on
[1:44:35] and I was talking to a brother in the
[1:44:38] Philippines whose son is in the AI realm
[1:44:42] artificial intelligence and augmented
[1:44:46] reality and he's high up in that age he
[1:44:48] said in in five years from now just
[1:44:50] throw away your iPhones and Androids
[1:44:53] he said they won't even be in existence
[1:44:56] well you say well how could that be well
[1:44:58] just think about it 10 years ago you
[1:44:59] never had an Android or or a smartphone
[1:45:03] so technology is moving on
[1:45:05] and it's never moving on for your
[1:45:08] benefit
[1:45:10] okay you say well I I'll have more time
[1:45:13] are you kidding me I would told my wife
[1:45:16] when I got my first 8880 880 whatever
[1:45:19] computer
[1:45:21] 8088 oh yeah before his time I said
[1:45:24] honey computers just think I can study
[1:45:28] faster
[1:45:30] no
[1:45:32] you just have more material
[1:45:34] we used to come to the pulpit with two
[1:45:36] or three pages now we come with 20.
[1:45:39] so it you know the thing the reality of
[1:45:42] life is things will speed up
[1:45:45] and is speeding up
[1:45:47] and all that is to detract you
[1:45:50] from the things of God
[1:45:54] and we have to start realizing where
[1:45:56] we're living in two kingdoms
[1:45:59] and that's why we pray thy kingdom come
[1:46:03] thy will be done because we do not live
[1:46:07] for this Kingdom
[1:46:09] we use this Kingdom
[1:46:13] can I say that again we use this Kingdom
[1:46:18] and I always look at this way plunder
[1:46:20] the Philistines
[1:46:23] plunder with all you can
[1:46:25] and use whatever you plunder for the
[1:46:28] kingdom of God
[1:46:31] I know I'll get a question on that one
[1:46:33] but that's okay
[1:46:34] I don't mind plundering the Philistines
[1:46:37] I said the Philippines one day and
[1:46:39] everybody looked at me weird
[1:46:42] because I was going to the Philippines
[1:46:45] don't blunder the Philippines they got
[1:46:48] nothing to plunder
[1:46:52] time goes on
[1:46:55] and as time goes on there shouldn't be
[1:46:57] less consideration for the things of God
[1:47:01] there should be more
[1:47:03] because the trick of the enemy is to
[1:47:06] consume your mind
[1:47:08] to take away that real estate of
[1:47:11] thinking
[1:47:13] away from the things of God
[1:47:18] that's why the scripture says in the
[1:47:21] days of The Voice
[1:47:25] because we needed a voice
[1:47:28] because you've got the voice of
[1:47:30] Economics you do have the voice of
[1:47:33] Technology you have the voice of success
[1:47:36] you have everything pushing you
[1:47:39] away from the voice of God
[1:47:44] boy that was a real raw Ross Damon
[1:47:47] wasn't it he said well I knew that
[1:47:49] already well then go to over it get rid
[1:47:52] of those other voices
[1:47:55] mm-hmm
[1:47:57] because they are right now I mean if
[1:47:59] you're in business you got to think of
[1:48:00] what's Happening next week
[1:48:02] is everything all planned up and set up
[1:48:04] that's fine but don't let it occupy your
[1:48:07] mind where you don't have time for the
[1:48:09] things of God so we're going to talk
[1:48:11] about the consideration of mortal to
[1:48:14] immortality because there is a spirit
[1:48:17] that is trying to hold you back from the
[1:48:21] place where you belong
[1:48:24] we don't belong here
[1:48:27] that's why you're not happy here
[1:48:31] and we know and we start to realize that
[1:48:35] there is a kingdom coming
[1:48:37] that we are a part of
[1:48:40] and that there should be something
[1:48:41] within you and me this morning saying
[1:48:45] Lord let the kingdom come because this
[1:48:49] world is crumbling and falling apart
[1:48:54] it used to be a time even when brother
[1:48:56] Ken and I were growing up in our 20s
[1:48:59] that our moms for some rare reason I'm
[1:49:02] only saying that because Ken told me
[1:49:03] about what his mom said I know what my
[1:49:06] mom said oh honey you're such Doom and
[1:49:09] Gloom
[1:49:10] things will get better
[1:49:13] well here we are 40 some odd years later
[1:49:16] and let me tell you
[1:49:18] things aren't better
[1:49:20] things are worse because a prophet said
[1:49:22] in north and not it will get worse
[1:49:25] and worse and worse
[1:49:28] so we're under the prophecy of the arrow
[1:49:33] so now as we go on a Sunday morning
[1:49:35] service now we're just going to dig a
[1:49:38] little deeper in God's love all right
[1:49:39] we're going to dig a little bit deeper
[1:49:42] and just and just see what the Holy
[1:49:44] Spirit would have this morning can you
[1:49:46] turn to a Hebrews chapter 11 verse 27.
[1:49:52] for those that are looking for success
[1:49:55] we're going to read about a man that had
[1:49:58] everything at his fingertips
[1:50:08] Hebrews 11 27 says by faith
[1:50:13] talking about Moses he forsook Egypt
[1:50:19] not fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:50:24] endured are you listening to me
[1:50:27] he endured as seeing him
[1:50:32] I want you to really I'm I'm going slow
[1:50:35] for a reason
[1:50:37] as seeing him who is invisible
[1:50:43] now
[1:50:46] who who said so
[1:50:50] foreign
[1:50:53] I saw him who is invisible
[1:50:57] and look what he did by seeing someone
[1:51:01] who was invisible
[1:51:05] he took two million people
[1:51:07] out of the grip of Egypt
[1:51:10] by the faith of seeing him who was
[1:51:14] invisible
[1:51:16] everybody there
[1:51:18] I'm right there
[1:51:20] okay wow brother Billy gave me the
[1:51:23] authority
[1:51:25] to read from Christ the minister God
[1:51:27] revealed
[1:51:29] he says every time you come here
[1:51:32] he said you used Christopher God
[1:51:34] revealed
[1:51:35] I said yeah I'm stuck with it I love it
[1:51:40] and I always I love uh wow
[1:51:45] so I want you to understand Moses by
[1:51:49] faith
[1:51:51] came out of Egypt
[1:51:53] right
[1:51:55] but why
[1:51:56] because he endured as seeing somebody
[1:51:58] who was what
[1:52:00] invisible
[1:52:03] oh somebody that was invisible you have
[1:52:06] a picture here
[1:52:09] I noticed
[1:52:11] the invisible
[1:52:13] has become visible
[1:52:17] so Moses by faith
[1:52:21] came out of Egypt
[1:52:24] and you had to believe what he said
[1:52:27] and then a prophet comes in this
[1:52:29] generation
[1:52:31] and says I said the same God
[1:52:34] that Moses meant is the god that I meet
[1:52:38] and he's still invisible but one day
[1:52:43] that invisible God
[1:52:45] became visible
[1:52:48] and they said it's not just a picture of
[1:52:50] a pillar of Fire
[1:52:52] it is a picture of God who was the
[1:52:56] invisible becoming visible so really
[1:52:59] what you're looking at now is two
[1:53:02] Dimensions meaning
[1:53:05] don't look it at a picture because that
[1:53:09] Pillar of Fire came from somewhere
[1:53:13] and he came from another dimension to
[1:53:16] this Dimension to a prophet that was in
[1:53:19] this Dimension to take you back to that
[1:53:22] dimension
[1:53:25] that's what the message is all about
[1:53:27] it's not starting at church we are the
[1:53:30] church we're going from this place to
[1:53:33] another place
[1:53:37] okay
[1:53:40] I slowed it down a bit that pretty good
[1:53:42] huh
[1:53:43] man
[1:53:44] get going with it Tom
[1:53:47] so now brother Brown says here on page
[1:53:55] 92.
[1:53:57] of things that are of uh
[1:54:01] Christ that mystery God revealed
[1:54:04] the Great
[1:54:06] Angel of the Covenant
[1:54:09] now now
[1:54:11] I I really want to emphasize this point
[1:54:14] because we're going to move from that
[1:54:15] point to another point
[1:54:18] that invisible
[1:54:22] that dwelt in another Realm
[1:54:26] Where Angels dwell
[1:54:29] where future homes being built
[1:54:33] in another dimension
[1:54:36] I want to get you out of this dimension
[1:54:38] uh-huh feely touchy hurty
[1:54:43] look past this Dimension because this
[1:54:47] Dimension is passing away
[1:54:50] so God sent a prophet to let you see
[1:54:54] into that Dimension so that you could
[1:54:57] feel a pull
[1:54:59] and only those that belong there have
[1:55:02] the pull
[1:55:04] and you say well you are crazy yep let
[1:55:07] me alone I love this
[1:55:11] I have been called to another dimension
[1:55:14] now he said the great Angel of the
[1:55:17] Covenant
[1:55:19] the one who was with Moses in the
[1:55:22] wilderness everybody got that you say oh
[1:55:25] I love Cecil B demille's
[1:55:28] he just that picture of the Ten
[1:55:30] Commandments is just incredible it's far
[1:55:33] past Cecil Peter Mills
[1:55:37] the one that was with Moses in the
[1:55:39] wilderness
[1:55:41] the one who met Paul now he's bringing
[1:55:44] it now thousands of years forward
[1:55:50] thousands
[1:55:52] the one that met Paul
[1:55:55] on the road to Damascus
[1:55:58] is the same one
[1:56:00] who allowed his picture
[1:56:08] so now
[1:56:10] Moses has declared to you he endured
[1:56:13] Egypt he left Egypt by seeing
[1:56:18] into the invisible
[1:56:23] now you have a prophet at the end of the
[1:56:26] ages
[1:56:28] saying that one who's now invisible is
[1:56:32] becoming visible
[1:56:34] and who is he coming visible to
[1:56:38] to you
[1:56:40] to the elect
[1:56:41] to only the sea Gene that even care
[1:56:46] because what amazes me is when I watch
[1:56:49] deep calleth the deep it doesn't amaze
[1:56:52] me that there's people that's not
[1:56:53] interested in this
[1:56:55] even in this church or my church at home
[1:56:59] it's not my church at our church at home
[1:57:02] in Cloverdale
[1:57:03] you have people that just come to church
[1:57:05] because maybe parents pushed you to come
[1:57:07] to church but there's no real Drive
[1:57:09] there's no real desire there's no real
[1:57:11] nothing there we're praying that there
[1:57:13] will be
[1:57:15] and we want it to happen
[1:57:18] but the desire for the things of God
[1:57:22] has only been given by God
[1:57:26] so a church can't give it to you a
[1:57:30] preacher can't give it to you
[1:57:32] a prophet said that you were
[1:57:34] predestinated for this only the
[1:57:37] predestinated see this
[1:57:41] oh I'm sorry friends you can tell a
[1:57:44] person about this message all you want
[1:57:47] but it takes a revelation from God
[1:57:50] himself to open their eyes to see this
[1:57:54] one who was once invisible becoming
[1:57:58] visible
[1:58:00] yeah
[1:58:02] say well I've been in meetings for so
[1:58:05] many years you can't tell me anything I
[1:58:07] don't know already well then why are you
[1:58:09] here
[1:58:10] if you're so spiritual how come you're
[1:58:12] not changed and gone there's obviously
[1:58:14] something in our lives that God is
[1:58:16] working on
[1:58:18] and I say Oh Holy Spirit we have
[1:58:21] meetings like this for you to work on
[1:58:23] the inner man
[1:58:25] because the outer man what perishes
[1:58:31] so now what you're looking at when you
[1:58:34] see the picture next time
[1:58:35] just say I'm looking at two different
[1:58:37] dimensions
[1:58:39] one that came into this dimension
[1:58:42] and one that lived in this dimension
[1:58:45] brother Branham lived in this dimension
[1:58:48] but then he says to us and we'll get
[1:58:50] into it he says I live in that other
[1:58:53] dimension sometimes More Than This
[1:58:56] dimension
[1:58:57] so people were wanting to get healed
[1:58:59] they wanted their names to be told and
[1:59:02] what he's trying to do is pull us
[1:59:05] from here to there
[1:59:07] and we still got the thing we got to
[1:59:10] pray we got to do saints of God we do
[1:59:13] pray and we do do but that's not the
[1:59:15] purpose of the message the message is to
[1:59:18] translate us into a rapture
[1:59:25] we're all right
[1:59:26] that only took 20 minutes
[1:59:30] okay
[1:59:31] well we're watching the time
[1:59:34] so Moses forsook Egypt fearing or not
[1:59:38] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:59:40] endured seeing him who was invisible can
[1:59:45] you turn to Second Corinthians 4 and 18.
[1:59:51] this is why
[1:59:54] nothing impresses me
[1:59:56] in this realm
[1:59:58] nothing
[2:00:02] because everything in this realm
[2:00:04] second Corinthians 4 18.
[2:00:07] everything in this realm
[2:00:10] that you see around you
[2:00:13] is perishing
[2:00:18] I know I know everybody gets caught up
[2:00:20] in in life and and we've got to live
[2:00:22] that I'm not saying we're not going to
[2:00:24] live but don't get it caught up in life
[2:00:27] because the things that that the devil
[2:00:30] tantalizes our our feelings and our
[2:00:33] emotions and our memories and our
[2:00:35] affections and all these other things
[2:00:37] are really just passing away
[2:00:40] use them lately second Corinthians 4 18
[2:00:43] well we look
[2:00:45] not at the things that are
[2:00:50] so you can read that that you can you
[2:00:52] can help me read I'm a slow learner at
[2:00:54] school
[2:00:57] while we look not at the things which
[2:01:00] are
[2:01:02] but at the things which are not
[2:01:06] for the things that are
[2:01:09] are temporal but the things which are
[2:01:13] not
[2:01:14] are eternal
[2:01:20] so now we're just we've just been
[2:01:22] planning it real slow I know I know you
[2:01:25] know we get so tantalized
[2:01:28] by laodicea by Amazon
[2:01:34] who knew Amazon's even name a few years
[2:01:37] ago
[2:01:41] Alibaba
[2:01:43] the Chinese website
[2:01:45] guys a billion gazillionaire
[2:01:48] and they're selling things
[2:01:53] and you again buy you can buy them on
[2:01:54] screen and send them back
[2:01:56] and then and all of a sudden you didn't
[2:01:59] go Windows the old idea used to be you
[2:02:02] brother Brown talks about it window
[2:02:04] shopping
[2:02:06] I think it's window grabbing
[2:02:08] that's what's happening these days
[2:02:09] they're going in grabbing everything
[2:02:19] start to realize things of life
[2:02:22] are just a tool to live
[2:02:24] and not a means to live for
[2:02:28] so while we look at the things
[2:02:32] which are seen
[2:02:34] we look not at the things that are seen
[2:02:36] But at the things which you're not
[2:02:37] seeing for the things which are seen are
[2:02:39] temporal but the things which are not
[2:02:41] seen are
[2:02:43] eternal
[2:02:45] so then if we start looking at the
[2:02:48] Unseen then brother Brahman says we are
[2:02:51] told that the outward man and the inward
[2:02:54] men are two different people
[2:02:57] the outward man looks with his eyes
[2:03:01] but the inward man looks and walks by
[2:03:06] faith
[2:03:08] um
[2:03:09] this is where we like to go
[2:03:11] that's why David can look at Goliath and
[2:03:14] see nothing
[2:03:17] because it's temporal
[2:03:19] he was anointed as a prophet to be king
[2:03:22] so there was nothing that's going to
[2:03:24] stand in his midst
[2:03:26] I could care less if there were 50
[2:03:28] goliaths
[2:03:30] it's just a number
[2:03:33] it's just the number it wasn't even the
[2:03:36] stone that killed Goliath
[2:03:39] it was the faith
[2:03:42] that was behind the stone
[2:03:45] so if you look at the outward man
[2:03:49] Israel knocked their knees
[2:03:53] and worried that this guy's a giant
[2:03:56] David looked at his God
[2:03:59] who was in an unseen Realm
[2:04:01] and said I can kill that thing and I
[2:04:05] want you to know this morning you can
[2:04:07] kill anything you want
[2:04:12] it's whether you want
[2:04:15] that's the problem
[2:04:17] we had homosexual come to our church and
[2:04:21] brother biscoll nailed them right
[2:04:23] between the eyes he says I want to be
[2:04:25] delivered he says no you don't
[2:04:28] he says you love that demon
[2:04:33] you cannot get Deliverance unless you
[2:04:37] hate the thing that is causing you
[2:04:40] problems
[2:04:43] come on
[2:04:45] come on you gotta hate that Spirit you
[2:04:50] gotta say I deny that devil I rebuke you
[2:04:53] in the name of Jesus Christ I hate you
[2:05:00] well you say well brother Tom how can
[2:05:01] can I can you give me an example I'll
[2:05:04] give you an example I was once a smoker
[2:05:07] before I got saved
[2:05:09] and I hated it and I hated it because
[2:05:13] everybody was telling me that it's not
[2:05:15] good for you
[2:05:16] but it's not smoking a cigarette it's a
[2:05:19] demon behind the cigarettes
[2:05:22] so every time I wanted to quit I
[2:05:25] crumpled it up and I threw it out the
[2:05:27] window but I counted the fence post
[2:05:33] because I knew tomorrow I needed those
[2:05:35] cigarettes
[2:05:39] you didn't really hate it
[2:05:41] you just disliked it
[2:05:44] but when I got saved
[2:05:47] and the Bible says he that destroys this
[2:05:50] Temple
[2:05:52] I will destroy
[2:05:54] I start to realize I gotta hate that
[2:05:57] thing that's out to destroy me
[2:06:00] and by hating it and asking Jesus to
[2:06:03] come into the temple I've never had a
[2:06:06] problem with cigarettes in my mouth
[2:06:09] from the day I got saved
[2:06:12] the key
[2:06:14] and you say well you're talking about
[2:06:15] cigarettes we could get into many areas
[2:06:18] of life personally and you know your
[2:06:20] area better than anybody
[2:06:23] and you say well brother Tom we want a
[2:06:26] prophet to discern that Spirit of lust
[2:06:29] or that
[2:06:30] anger or that whatever we want to put
[2:06:32] there
[2:06:33] when it's already being discerned by the
[2:06:35] word right now
[2:06:37] it just didn't call your name
[2:06:40] he just came to your address
[2:06:46] so the things
[2:06:48] that trouble us
[2:06:51] are temporal
[2:06:53] you can deal with it right now
[2:06:57] you can take the word of God and bind
[2:07:00] that demon
[2:07:02] and say never to bother me again
[2:07:09] we live in dimensional realms
[2:07:15] and I'm more and more your being
[2:07:18] inundated by it
[2:07:21] I grew up in 1954 when I was born and my
[2:07:26] television that my father bought as a
[2:07:29] babysitter because my mom was going to
[2:07:30] have another baby and the only thing I
[2:07:34] could see was an image in snowflakes
[2:07:37] now you don't have a clue outside being
[2:07:40] older than me what I'm talking about
[2:07:42] you turned on the TV and was black and
[2:07:45] white dots fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy
[2:07:48] and you had to stand on top of the roof
[2:07:50] with the antenna
[2:07:51] how many of us froze on top of the roof
[2:07:55] a hockey games playing you can't see
[2:07:58] nothing to the left to the right get it
[2:08:03] right
[2:08:05] and now technology man I walk into a
[2:08:09] electronics store and you see the
[2:08:11] pictures that are unbelievable beautiful
[2:08:15] I said where were you when I was three
[2:08:18] years old
[2:08:23] but it only is getting better because
[2:08:25] it's Satan's Eden
[2:08:27] to attract the lust of the eyes
[2:08:30] the lust of the Flesh and the pride of
[2:08:33] life but I'm letting you know this
[2:08:35] morning that's temporal
[2:08:38] that is a temporal
[2:08:41] realm of reality is what they would call
[2:08:45] it's not even real
[2:08:48] everybody in that picture is a phony
[2:08:53] you think that she looks that beautiful
[2:08:55] are you kidding
[2:08:58] she's had a makeup artist for four hours
[2:09:00] making her up
[2:09:02] then they get a graphic God designer to
[2:09:05] take every pimple and pour out of her
[2:09:07] face
[2:09:09] I'm just trying to help you
[2:09:13] and we get so enamored
[2:09:15] by the Marlboro Man
[2:09:18] the guy in a horse oh I'm for God I'm in
[2:09:20] Texas
[2:09:23] you know he's got that sheepskin jacket
[2:09:26] on with the hat on his head and he's the
[2:09:28] Marlboro Man he's dead you know
[2:09:31] did you know what he died of cancer
[2:09:34] yeah great product to be selling
[2:09:38] but I'm not selling you a project uh I'm
[2:09:40] not selling you a product
[2:09:42] it's free that's right
[2:09:45] it's free whatever they have is temporal
[2:09:48] and it's passing away and it means
[2:09:51] nothing today
[2:09:54] so whatever you think is something it is
[2:09:57] going to be nothing
[2:10:01] and so now we want to by faith now start
[2:10:04] looking from this natural realm into a
[2:10:07] spiritual Realm
[2:10:10] and so often
[2:10:12] the prophet would say
[2:10:14] now he's here
[2:10:17] he's just 20 feet away or he's just 10
[2:10:20] feet away or he's just above me or he's
[2:10:24] standing right here
[2:10:27] what was he trying to do bring you
[2:10:30] into another dimension
[2:10:33] who did she touch
[2:10:36] is that that you remember that
[2:10:38] or who did he touch
[2:10:41] so it wasn't a physical touch
[2:10:44] it was a faith touch
[2:10:47] and so if God could just increase your
[2:10:49] faith a little bit this morning not to
[2:10:53] touch the things of life but to look
[2:10:55] into another realm of where you're going
[2:10:57] then I pray that the Holy Spirit would
[2:11:00] achieve
[2:11:01] what he wants for you this morning
[2:11:05] the Bible says this
[2:11:08] in second Corinthians 4 and 15.
[2:11:11] for all things are for your sakes
[2:11:15] of course we could preach stop right
[2:11:18] there
[2:11:19] that's the abundant grace might through
[2:11:21] the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the
[2:11:25] glory of God now we're looking at Old
[2:11:27] English we're looking at what the King
[2:11:30] James version says here but if you look
[2:11:32] at the different translations that were
[2:11:35] were used to get to this point you find
[2:11:39] out then these things are for your sake
[2:11:41] that the remarkable Grace
[2:11:45] of God reaches to more people
[2:11:49] and it increases at Thanksgiving to the
[2:11:52] glory of God
[2:11:54] so it's not you
[2:11:57] But as God using you to reach the many
[2:12:04] because there's people like us
[2:12:07] that wanted what we've got
[2:12:10] now
[2:12:12] that didn't know how to get what we got
[2:12:16] run from church to church
[2:12:19] spoke to people
[2:12:21] spoke to theologians
[2:12:23] and we were looking and trying to find
[2:12:25] what the word is termed God
[2:12:29] but then we find through a message you
[2:12:32] can't find him
[2:12:35] he finds you
[2:12:39] so is God reaching From Another
[2:12:41] Dimension to this Dimension to bring you
[2:12:44] back to that dimension
[2:12:48] just I hope I'm not confusing you
[2:12:51] because I'm trying to just go as slow as
[2:12:53] possible
[2:12:55] so that you can realize that the crazy
[2:12:58] seats that you're sitting in we I don't
[2:12:59] mean it crazy in the sense of crazy
[2:13:01] crazy I mean it's the material
[2:13:04] that was made to make deceit is
[2:13:07] non-existent right now
[2:13:09] as far as God's concerned you need it
[2:13:12] because you're in this dimension
[2:13:14] but once you move to that Dimension and
[2:13:16] once this world gets a renovation
[2:13:19] it's all gone
[2:13:22] and I think let me let me help you on
[2:13:25] this other thought just I'll just help
[2:13:27] try and help you because this really
[2:13:29] became real to me anybody heard of
[2:13:31] Fukushima
[2:13:33] Fukushima Nuclear Plant
[2:13:36] and and the disruption and uh Fukushima
[2:13:39] had
[2:13:40] on on on the people
[2:13:42] towns were Swept Away by tsunamis
[2:13:47] nuclear fallout was everywhere people
[2:13:49] are dying
[2:13:51] did you see the the rivers of homes
[2:13:55] floating away Vehicles being Swept Away
[2:13:59] did anybody see that
[2:14:00] I'll I'll try and help you I did
[2:14:04] houses beautiful homes being swept away
[2:14:06] cars that were worth thousands of
[2:14:09] dollars getting swept away maybe 24
[2:14:12] hours before that the husband and wife
[2:14:14] got together and said hey we're not
[2:14:16] going to Window Shop we're actually
[2:14:18] going to buy we have saved up ten
[2:14:21] thousand dollars to buy this vehicle or
[2:14:23] to buy this object what did it mean 24
[2:14:25] hours later
[2:14:28] what did it mean 24 hours later
[2:14:31] their expression is as long as we got
[2:14:34] away with our life
[2:14:37] so the house didn't matter
[2:14:39] the things that the house didn't matter
[2:14:41] the car didn't matter but what matters
[2:14:44] is life and why does a preacher preach
[2:14:47] it's for your life
[2:14:50] Let Jesus Christ that Giver of Life
[2:14:54] Come From Another Dimension into this
[2:14:58] room
[2:14:59] but there has to be an atmosphere and I
[2:15:02] believe it's here where you can reach
[2:15:04] out and say nothing is impossible
[2:15:10] nothing's impossible
[2:15:13] listen no snickering boys brother
[2:15:15] Michael was talking about the other day
[2:15:17] they were snickering they were mocking
[2:15:22] they weren't sitting there like you and
[2:15:24] nice and listening so attentively they
[2:15:27] weren't sitting there listening to a
[2:15:28] prophet's story they were mocking a
[2:15:30] prophet
[2:15:32] they were telling their own things and
[2:15:34] they're doing their own thing so I don't
[2:15:36] care where you are I know that in a
[2:15:38] moment
[2:15:40] when that Arrow got shot
[2:15:42] nothing going to stop those two children
[2:15:45] to fall at the feet of Jesus Christ
[2:15:49] so that's what I believe
[2:15:52] and so that is another dimension for the
[2:15:55] Bible says in second Corinthians 5 and 7
[2:15:57] we walk by
[2:16:01] and not by
[2:16:03] can we read that together again
[2:16:06] for we walk by
[2:16:08] and not by
[2:16:10] okay
[2:16:14] anybody ever wanted something so bad
[2:16:18] that you just thought about it 24 hours
[2:16:20] a day
[2:16:21] I got one man on this brother right here
[2:16:25] I I says oh man my son is sweater I
[2:16:29] gotta have
[2:16:31] right I gotta put away that extra few
[2:16:33] shekels
[2:16:35] to buy that sweater that might make me
[2:16:38] look so great for whom
[2:16:41] is my question
[2:16:44] I will look at these brothers and say
[2:16:46] that again
[2:16:47] who do we want to look great for
[2:16:50] do we want a great great so that guys
[2:16:53] could be looking at us or do we want to
[2:16:55] be great that Jesus would be honored to
[2:16:57] walk with us
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:00] so we do not walk then by
[2:17:03] sight
[2:17:04] we walk by
[2:17:07] faith
[2:17:08] we walk by faith
[2:17:11] brother Ram says this in Fellowship of
[2:17:13] redemption now in meetings sometimes I
[2:17:16] watch those Visions become material
[2:17:19] I thought oh God
[2:17:22] how can it be
[2:17:25] when standing here a minute ago
[2:17:28] stood a man with his arms folded looking
[2:17:32] to me and I heard his voice talking to
[2:17:35] me and telling me things that's going to
[2:17:38] happen there they've never failed yet he
[2:17:42] vanishes away
[2:17:44] and I know then that there is a land
[2:17:48] beyond the river
[2:17:52] that's what we want to be focusing on
[2:17:54] now for the next little while there is a
[2:17:57] land
[2:17:58] beyond the river
[2:18:00] that they call the sweet
[2:18:04] forever
[2:18:06] he says there's a lamb beyond the river
[2:18:07] there's a region Yonder there's
[2:18:10] somewhere that that glorious persons of
[2:18:13] the great angels of God and their beings
[2:18:17] are fellowshipping again
[2:18:20] can you imagine we're sitting in this
[2:18:23] little church and God has got his angels
[2:18:27] fellowshipping in a realm where you're
[2:18:29] going
[2:18:31] who wants to go there
[2:18:34] [Applause]
[2:18:35] glorious who put that desire there God
[2:18:39] put that desire there and we're not
[2:18:41] going to be tied down by by anything
[2:18:43] Satan throws at us no Gadget
[2:18:46] say no Gadget no fashion no car no house
[2:18:51] nothing that's temporal gonna hold me
[2:18:55] from going to that dimension
[2:18:58] right
[2:19:00] we either believe this message or we
[2:19:02] don't
[2:19:03] you either believe what I just preached
[2:19:05] to you right now or just walk out of the
[2:19:07] church because saints of God to me is
[2:19:09] more real than you sitting here
[2:19:13] he says now I know there's a land beyond
[2:19:16] the river there's a region out yonder
[2:19:19] somewhere that the Glorious persons of
[2:19:23] the great angels of God and his beings
[2:19:26] are fellowshipping again oh the
[2:19:30] fellowship God wanted back at the
[2:19:33] beginning has now started to move down
[2:19:38] come on people
[2:19:40] father loves Fellowship
[2:19:43] Christ the mystery God reveals he loves
[2:19:47] Fellowship that's what he wants and
[2:19:50] Satan wants to take it from you
[2:19:56] barely get it time to pray 15 minutes
[2:20:01] hmm I got a few whoms
[2:20:06] mm-hmm
[2:20:08] can I
[2:20:14] he takes it away
[2:20:16] because we get so caught up with the
[2:20:18] things of life but we walked on after
[2:20:21] the natural
[2:20:23] but we walk after the things of God by
[2:20:26] faith
[2:20:29] he said your sight your hearing you're
[2:20:32] feeling you're smelling you're tasting
[2:20:36] we cannot be normal without them
[2:20:40] but there's something missing
[2:20:43] some portion of life that we cannot
[2:20:46] contact
[2:20:48] without the sense acting
[2:20:52] whatever those senses are yielded to
[2:20:55] they will dominate you
[2:21:01] so we covered the five senses didn't we
[2:21:03] so whatever you're yielding to will
[2:21:06] dominate you
[2:21:08] but by no means were those five senses
[2:21:12] given to you to guide you
[2:21:14] they were given to you only for Earthly
[2:21:18] contact
[2:21:21] so there's a contact here
[2:21:24] that only these five senses contact but
[2:21:27] there's a sixth sense it is the faith
[2:21:30] sense that reaches out of this realm
[2:21:32] into another Realm
[2:21:35] your natural eye sings sees things that
[2:21:38] are created
[2:21:39] your eyes have faith see the
[2:21:42] supernatural Realm
[2:21:44] Beyond this realm the outward man is a
[2:21:49] part of creation and it sees this
[2:21:51] creation but the inward man that came
[2:21:54] from the Creator
[2:21:56] that germ seed put there looks beyond
[2:22:01] the five senses and looks into another
[2:22:04] Realm
[2:22:07] now
[2:22:08] you say well you know it's brother Tom
[2:22:11] you you have you know it seems like when
[2:22:13] you're preaching you're preaching we can
[2:22:15] do it and we can do it and we're more
[2:22:17] than conquerors and services after
[2:22:20] service that's right that's what I'm
[2:22:23] preaching
[2:22:24] you're Conquering the outer man
[2:22:29] by the word
[2:22:31] because Satan plays with us and we think
[2:22:35] that this is our Utopia this is the
[2:22:38] worst you're ever going to know
[2:22:43] get off Fox News
[2:22:47] see I got it more than that
[2:22:49] um
[2:22:51] I even got a few rights on that one
[2:22:54] how about CNN
[2:22:57] MSNBC
[2:22:59] because it's not news it's gossip
[2:23:03] you know I I want to know what's
[2:23:05] happening in Ukraine and I'm and they're
[2:23:07] talking about some comedian Stephen
[2:23:08] Colbert or something
[2:23:10] was he
[2:23:12] there's no news
[2:23:15] who's Madonna
[2:23:18] front news
[2:23:20] these are demons
[2:23:23] you might as well let them know what it
[2:23:25] is and you say well I know Madonna say
[2:23:28] those are demons
[2:23:30] just get into the realm where the
[2:23:32] Prophet wasn't he'll tell you exactly
[2:23:35] what these stripped down striptease
[2:23:37] people are they're demons that are
[2:23:40] tantalizing the fleshly man
[2:23:43] to keep them away from the spiritual
[2:23:45] Realms of God and he's got the world
[2:23:48] don't you worry he's got them but now
[2:23:51] he's now fighting for your soul
[2:23:54] and that's why God sent a messenger
[2:23:57] that could reach within that realm to
[2:24:00] let you know what that realm was about
[2:24:03] so that your heart would be turned
[2:24:09] not just from Egypt
[2:24:11] but to another land
[2:24:14] future home
[2:24:15] things that are to be
[2:24:18] these are key messages rapture
[2:24:21] you read them you heard him
[2:24:24] read them again
[2:24:27] when that woman touched His Garment or
[2:24:30] when blind Bartimaeus stop Jesus
[2:24:34] did they touch him
[2:24:36] by face or by the natural man
[2:24:41] said blind Martin Emmaus Jesus couldn't
[2:24:44] even hear him
[2:24:46] the crowd was too loud
[2:24:50] but he had a need
[2:24:53] and there is only one that could reach
[2:24:56] that need
[2:24:59] and what he said
[2:25:01] the Bible says he cried out Jesus
[2:25:04] and Jesus never heard him
[2:25:08] Jesus never heard him
[2:25:13] the natural man the Flesh of Jesus never
[2:25:17] heard him
[2:25:21] but the god part of the man
[2:25:26] heard the faith part
[2:25:28] of another man
[2:25:30] and delivered him
[2:25:35] we want to lift your face up
[2:25:38] not your emotion
[2:25:41] come on
[2:25:42] we want to lift up your faith this
[2:25:45] morning
[2:25:46] let's forget about the emotion that we
[2:25:49] love emotion because without emotion it
[2:25:52] means you're dead but we want to raise
[2:25:54] your faith level to a realm where all
[2:25:58] things are possible
[2:26:10] thank you
[2:26:12] there has to be
[2:26:15] an expectation
[2:26:21] that creates
[2:26:23] a desire
[2:26:26] that doesn't come
[2:26:28] from me pumping you up
[2:26:33] but there's an expectation of the Inner
[2:26:35] Man
[2:26:36] that says there is a place
[2:26:39] better than this place
[2:26:42] and and now Paul writes in Philippians
[2:26:44] according to my Earnest expectation and
[2:26:46] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[2:26:48] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[2:26:51] always so now also Christ shall be
[2:26:55] magnified in my body whether it be by
[2:26:58] life or by death it is something that's
[2:27:02] driving us
[2:27:05] man
[2:27:06] amen
[2:27:07] it's not something that you're scolded
[2:27:11] into
[2:27:13] or yelled into
[2:27:16] as a coach would on a football field as
[2:27:18] we took the analogy yesterday
[2:27:21] you're out of position
[2:27:25] but by the word of God we start to
[2:27:27] understand that there is another realm
[2:27:30] that's more real than this realm because
[2:27:32] we had a prophet step within both realms
[2:27:36] and we get caught up in one Realm
[2:27:39] but if you want to take the quotes that
[2:27:41] I'm going to be quoting and different
[2:27:42] things that are being said there's more
[2:27:44] that he talks about that Realm
[2:27:47] then you even understand or I've
[2:27:49] understood before studying this little
[2:27:51] subject
[2:27:56] just think he says just think
[2:28:01] you're at the end of time now
[2:28:07] time will fade into eternity
[2:28:09] maybe today
[2:28:12] so the question would be where would you
[2:28:14] be
[2:28:16] where is your heart where's your
[2:28:18] expectation where's your anticipation
[2:28:22] your dinner
[2:28:24] you know I have this is a crazy thing
[2:28:26] that happened to me in Dallas Texas
[2:28:29] my wife says that everything you think
[2:28:31] about is food
[2:28:37] she's not going to dispute it she's
[2:28:39] standing right there
[2:28:41] see how you finished breakfast you
[2:28:42] already got lunch plan
[2:28:45] and when lunch is done there's dinner
[2:28:47] we're having dinner
[2:28:48] huh but being here I don't have no
[2:28:51] desire for food
[2:28:53] because I'm fed up
[2:28:58] that's a good thing right
[2:29:03] but this feeding of the Soul
[2:29:08] is what's way more important
[2:29:11] and it's really going to do something
[2:29:13] very special for you
[2:29:15] because you'll start looking at hey the
[2:29:18] suit it's just cloth the tie it's just
[2:29:22] whatever
[2:29:25] brother Graham said in the message
[2:29:27] Shalom there's something laying ahead of
[2:29:29] us
[2:29:30] the years have been Joy and we've been
[2:29:34] looking for looking forward to
[2:29:37] the pressing coming of a great light
[2:29:41] and now we can see the breaking over
[2:29:45] that horizontal Realm it's breaking
[2:29:49] between Mortal and immortality
[2:29:53] shalom 1964.
[2:29:57] we see it breaking Between Heaven and
[2:29:59] Earth
[2:30:01] from an Earthbound sickness and troubled
[2:30:03] world
[2:30:04] into a bright shining day of immortal
[2:30:08] life and an immortal body and an
[2:30:11] immortal Earth that shall never pass
[2:30:14] away
[2:30:16] oh it's a shalom
[2:30:19] unto the church it's light time for the
[2:30:23] coming of Believers but it's a gross
[2:30:25] Darkness for the people
[2:30:32] that's an announcement
[2:30:37] that's an announcement
[2:30:40] that is where we're going and it's
[2:30:43] breaking and it's becoming realer
[2:30:47] and like some brother told me he says
[2:30:49] where do you get the word realer
[2:30:52] and he says I'm making a dictionary up
[2:30:55] of all your new words
[2:30:57] but it's becoming realer and realer
[2:31:02] now let's just digress for a minute
[2:31:05] because I know you're you're
[2:31:07] growing weary already so I'll just try
[2:31:10] and speed things up a bit
[2:31:14] hints

[2:31:58] I won't even name brand the store okay
[2:32:01] stores pump fragrance
[2:32:04] into the air
[2:32:07] because they want because by the sense
[2:32:11] of smell
[2:32:13] makes you time travel
[2:32:16] because if you smell that smell again
[2:32:18] somewhere else
[2:32:19] it brings you back to the place where
[2:32:21] you first smelled it
[2:32:24] that's right

[2:32:55] so they had a department in their sales
[2:32:58] department and said how do we increase
[2:33:00] our sales
[2:33:03] so a gentleman came up with a great idea
[2:33:05] he says let's get a scratch and smell
[2:33:09] pad
[2:33:11] and put it in our ad
[2:33:13] and the smell was new leather
[2:33:17] who's ever stepped into a new car
[2:33:20] and smelt new leather
[2:33:23] ah

[2:33:29] mean
[2:33:30] you know what their sales went up
[2:33:33] their sales went up within a week 16
[2:33:36] percent
[2:33:38] just by a little patch that you could
[2:33:41] scratch and smell new leather
[2:33:44] it was all phony
[2:33:47] but they sold cars
[2:33:52] how about
[2:33:54] another sense of hearing

[2:34:27] their eggs aren't eggs
[2:34:30] I just thought I'd help you out on that
[2:34:32] one
[2:34:36] how about
[2:34:37] mm-hmm good

[2:34:47] looking at you
[2:34:49] there's no way that means
[2:34:51] Campbell Soup what were they doing they
[2:34:55] were getting your sense of your hearing
[2:35:00] um
[2:35:01] good
[2:35:03] we we thought that was a good one in
[2:35:05] University
[2:35:07] Campbell's Soup
[2:35:09] how about oh no you wouldn't know this
[2:35:12] one because you're not my age
[2:35:13] it hit the spot
[2:35:16] Pepsi
[2:35:18] that's why I'm a Pepsi drinker
[2:35:20] not a Coke drinker the real thing are
[2:35:23] you kidding me
[2:35:25] so all these sayings
[2:35:29] are to what
[2:35:30] get a hold of your outer man
[2:35:33] but God sent a voice
[2:35:35] not to get your outer man not to tingle
[2:35:38] your ears but they hit the Inner Man and
[2:35:41] it's a bullseye every time
[2:35:45] yeah
[2:35:46] [Applause]
[2:35:47] I'm trying to bring the back back and
[2:35:50] forth to you to understand this world is
[2:35:53] using you
[2:35:54] it's abusing you and and it's directing
[2:35:58] your even the trains of your thought
[2:36:00] that's why you need to sit down and
[2:36:04] consider
[2:36:06] am I being affected by laodicea or am I
[2:36:09] being affected by the word of the Lord
[2:36:12] I came from these meetings I wanted God
[2:36:15] to meet me it's not by your feelings
[2:36:18] it's by the word
[2:36:20] and has it hit the target yes it has
[2:36:25] amen
[2:36:29] Hallelujah
[2:36:35] for you to have an expectation where did
[2:36:37] that expectation come from
[2:36:40] God
[2:36:44] so expectation then of expectation came
[2:36:46] from God does God have expectation
[2:36:51] he surely does Isaiah penned that arrow
[2:36:54] down
[2:36:55] oh man I love that message Mike you
[2:36:58] preach it again at home preach it here
[2:37:00] again preach it everywhere you want
[2:37:02] because it's profound
[2:37:04] because that word was sent forth it was
[2:37:07] sent forth
[2:37:09] and the Bible says in Isaiah 53 and it
[2:37:12] pleased the Lord to be bruise him
[2:37:17] and put him to grief
[2:37:19] that when they'll make his soul an
[2:37:22] offering for sin and we go there and we
[2:37:25] use that scripture wonderfully because
[2:37:27] it's of my most beautiful scripture but
[2:37:30] in squeezed in there says he shall see
[2:37:36] his seed
[2:37:38] yes
[2:37:41] do you see that there
[2:37:43] you see that there
[2:37:45] so he has an expectation he went to the
[2:37:48] cross for you and me knowing he's going
[2:37:52] to see you
[2:37:55] where is he going to see you he's not
[2:37:57] going to see you here he's going to see
[2:37:59] you at the wedding supper
[2:38:07] he shall see his seed now I want you to
[2:38:14] say I am his seed
[2:38:16] I'm in seed I've been birthed by the
[2:38:19] word I am his Gene I am his expectation
[2:38:25] I am not living for this world I'm
[2:38:28] living for another world
[2:38:35] hmm
[2:38:37] the Lord himself has an expectation
[2:38:42] we have children and we have expect them
[2:38:44] to be certain types of people
[2:38:47] we expect them to be doctors and lawyers
[2:38:49] or accountants or firemen or doctors or
[2:38:52] whatever
[2:38:52] policemen whatever accountants
[2:38:57] there's an expectation that comes with
[2:38:59] the parent I remember telling my son
[2:39:02] he came home one day not Michael so I
[2:39:04] won't say the other one to a half but
[2:39:07] one of them comes home said dad he's in
[2:39:10] grade four
[2:39:11] he said Dad
[2:39:13] I want to be a flag person
[2:39:16] I go what
[2:39:19] he said I want to be a flag person
[2:39:24] son
[2:39:25] a flag person I said get your
[2:39:29] ambition higher
[2:39:31] come on
[2:39:33] flag person
[2:39:34] stop
[2:39:36] go
[2:39:38] stop
[2:39:43] I'll get to that point
[2:39:45] I said okay okay I thought man
[2:39:49] this is unbelievable how did I raise a
[2:39:52] flag person
[2:39:58] he is
[2:40:01] you know he owns the company actually so
[2:40:04] anyway
[2:40:10] I go to my office
[2:40:13] and I get down to pray for him for a
[2:40:15] thought for the local assembly
[2:40:18] and it seemed like the Holy Spirit was
[2:40:20] saying what's wrong with that
[2:40:24] what is wrong with that
[2:40:26] I got rebuked
[2:40:28] I mean it was a major rebuke
[2:40:31] he said if he wants to be a flagger let
[2:40:34] him be a flagger let him be the best
[2:40:36] flagger
[2:40:38] I said okay
[2:40:39] so I went up to Sam I says hey Sam if
[2:40:41] you want to be a flag or be a flagger
[2:40:43] and we left it at that
[2:40:46] so then when he got out of school he
[2:40:49] worked for a a landscape company
[2:40:52] you know landscape companies they got
[2:40:54] dump trucks and they got you know back
[2:40:55] up you know and hold traffic where we go
[2:40:59] out of our minds because we're being
[2:41:02] held by two minutes
[2:41:04] when are they gonna move that dragon
[2:41:06] come on
[2:41:07] so
[2:41:09] Sam was working away at this landscape
[2:41:11] company and his boss says go get the
[2:41:13] stop sign and be the flagger
[2:41:17] um
[2:41:19] so he says okay
[2:41:21] so it got to be what hey watch what your
[2:41:24] heart desires
[2:41:27] you're gonna get it
[2:41:30] and you're gonna know what sometimes
[2:41:32] that's why I said consider consider
[2:41:36] so he gets this soft sign and you've
[2:41:39] always seen those people that stand
[2:41:40] there huh
[2:41:42] and so he says okay this is my chance
[2:41:44] I'm control of the whole traffic system
[2:41:48] of British Columbia
[2:41:53] and he holds the stop sign the guy who
[2:41:55] drives right by him
[2:41:56] foreign
[2:42:05] stop
[2:42:08] so the next guy comes out driving up
[2:42:10] stops for a minute takes off and he says
[2:42:13] what's the matter with you people
[2:42:16] that was his end of his stop sign career
[2:42:22] but now he owns a company
[2:42:24] that's bizarre I never thought of that
[2:42:26] until now
[2:42:29] but here we are
[2:42:32] God has a desire within our hearts
[2:42:36] and he's going to fulfill that
[2:42:39] desire
[2:42:41] whatsoever you desire
[2:42:44] When you pray
[2:42:46] you shall have what you ask
[2:42:49] you know what I'd love this morning
[2:42:51] you should say brother Tom the hearts
[2:42:53] desire
[2:42:54] would be I want to go to heaven
[2:42:56] I want to go to heaven
[2:42:58] I I want to be with the Lord Jesus
[2:43:02] if that reality became real to you this
[2:43:05] morning then I'd say well this broken up
[2:43:07] little message meant something to
[2:43:09] somebody
[2:43:10] you've moved you
[2:43:12] from where now Satan has tried to hold
[2:43:15] you and that's why brother Brown said he
[2:43:18] said God broke Satan's grip in future
[2:43:21] home he broke the grip of Satan
[2:43:25] without this message I'm sorry you're
[2:43:28] gripped by the Devil Himself
[2:43:32] looking to the Unseen my subject tonight
[2:43:34] he says is looking at the Unseen
[2:43:38] we are told that we have an outward and
[2:43:42] an inward man
[2:43:44] the outward man looks with his eyes and
[2:43:46] the inward man walks by faith
[2:43:48] so we have to be led by one of these two
[2:43:51] persons
[2:43:53] outside the outside or the outward man
[2:43:56] is self the inward man is God you see we
[2:44:01] do not see with our eyes though many
[2:44:04] times we have thought we see with our
[2:44:06] eyes
[2:44:07] but there was given you a sixth sense
[2:44:10] and that Sixth Sense only
[2:44:14] belongs only
[2:44:16] to Christians
[2:44:19] did you get that
[2:44:22] The Sixth Sense only belongs to
[2:44:25] Christians
[2:44:26] you can not have this Sixth Sense until
[2:44:31] you become a Christian
[2:44:34] is the only way that you could ever have
[2:44:37] any more than five senses for the
[2:44:40] natural man but the Sixth Sense is
[2:44:44] better known to Christians as their
[2:44:47] faith sense
[2:44:49] it's the one that governs you
[2:44:53] and guides you
[2:44:56] and it's Superior
[2:44:58] to all other senses
[2:45:03] um
[2:45:07] it's Superior
[2:45:09] to all other senses all of the five
[2:45:13] senses
[2:45:14] the super sense is the Holy Spirit the
[2:45:17] faith of God that dwells in you and if
[2:45:19] you will let the five senses be yielded
[2:45:22] to that sixth sense it will guide you
[2:45:26] and bring the other five senses under
[2:45:29] its control
[2:45:32] and that then becomes your super sense
[2:45:38] it's so far above the natural sense as
[2:45:41] the spiritual man is above the natural
[2:45:43] man it's as far and high as Heaven is
[2:45:49] above the natural man and its five
[2:45:52] senses reach higher
[2:45:55] look higher
[2:45:58] think deeper
[2:46:00] reach for the promise of God
[2:46:03] amen it makes you believe things you
[2:46:07] can't see
[2:46:09] that's where we'd love to start
[2:46:11] preaching now
[2:46:13] it makes you believe for the things you
[2:46:16] can't
[2:46:17] see
[2:46:20] well you say brother Tom I have that
[2:46:21] growth I can't see it but my faith tells
[2:46:23] me it's gone
[2:46:25] my faith tells me that that complex that
[2:46:28] is in another realm is not my complex
[2:46:30] it's the devil's complex and I resist
[2:46:34] that complex and I take dominion over
[2:46:37] that complex and I stand as a daughter
[2:46:40] and a son of God
[2:46:44] and I live far above this Earthly man
[2:46:49] it's a super sense that reaches out that
[2:46:52] came from God and it's called faith
[2:47:00] yes sister
[2:47:04] you with the back black gloves on
[2:47:09] your hand
[2:47:11] raise up look look at me
[2:47:14] if I don't quote to you your prayer that
[2:47:17] you're praying that I heard in another
[2:47:19] dimension
[2:47:21] in another world
[2:47:25] I'll tell you what you were praying
[2:47:28] will you believe that Jesus heard you
[2:47:31] so now it wasn't William Branham
[2:47:34] come on let's get together it wasn't
[2:47:36] William Branham that heard her prayer it
[2:47:38] was the god and William Branham that
[2:47:40] heard her prayer it was the god in that
[2:47:43] messenger that's trying to bring you out
[2:47:45] of this realm into another Realm
[2:47:49] ah but we get so caught up
[2:47:52] especially use and I'm not looking at
[2:47:54] the the older ones are past this front
[2:47:56] rows here
[2:47:58] oh I look so lovely this morning
[2:48:02] it's so far past that
[2:48:04] you might look lovely that's good or you
[2:48:07] might look so handsome
[2:48:12] there's another realm we live for
[2:48:15] keep your eyes on that Realm
[2:48:17] keep your eyes on that prize
[2:48:20] he said sister
[2:48:22] do you believe that Jesus heard your
[2:48:23] prayer now here's a man that's coming
[2:48:25] out of two realms
[2:48:27] sister
[2:48:29] you don't think I don't know what you're
[2:48:30] thinking right now
[2:48:32] he said how could you know what I'm
[2:48:33] thinking right now God knows every
[2:48:36] thought that you're thinking now and
[2:48:39] will ever think he knows we say well
[2:48:41] that's just he's a sir that he's just um
[2:48:44] preaching and nothing's going to happen
[2:48:46] to me he knows your thought
[2:48:48] and he knows that that unbelief is
[2:48:50] sitting there but now he also knows that
[2:48:53] faith is sitting there and you say just
[2:48:55] a second here I'm hearing a preacher
[2:48:57] preach and I'm going to tell that devil
[2:48:59] I'm not going to have that unbelief
[2:49:00] anymore I I'm putting a stop to this by
[2:49:03] the word of the Lord I'm reaching into
[2:49:06] another dimension pulling it down to
[2:49:08] this Dimension and say Satan
[2:49:10] yeah
[2:49:13] I accept my healing
[2:49:17] I Take God at his promise
[2:49:20] he said now I'm raised you he says now
[2:49:22] I've raised you up to a level of faith
[2:49:25] she he got she got raised up to a level
[2:49:28] of faith
[2:49:29] he said you believe
[2:49:32] he governs that by Sixth Sense
[2:49:36] super sense oh how Marvel it is to know
[2:49:39] it
[2:49:40] think how simple it is to believe it oh
[2:49:44] sister dear didn't you hear from another
[2:49:47] dimension
[2:49:49] and you've been listening to William
[2:49:51] Branham for how many years
[2:49:53] and yet now realizing that it's not
[2:49:56] William Branham I'm listening to
[2:49:58] it's the spirit of God through the
[2:50:00] vessel
[2:50:01] that's trying to Quicken your heart and
[2:50:03] turn your heart
[2:50:04] not just from Egypt it turned it to now
[2:50:07] heaven
[2:50:12] here's a man here I believe is honest in
[2:50:14] heart I've never seen him before God
[2:50:17] knows all about him I had talked to him
[2:50:19] a minute and see what God would do it's
[2:50:22] hard sometimes to single out straight in
[2:50:25] front of me at least two dozen people
[2:50:27] are praying right now
[2:50:31] their Spirits are in another world
[2:50:35] and when the vision starts coming they
[2:50:38] start moving this way and that way and I
[2:50:40] can't detect which one it is
[2:50:43] but then I look this way and that's
[2:50:45] where you are so after so many you can't
[2:50:49] tell where you're at hardly
[2:50:51] I'm trying to get you singled out
[2:50:55] and I keep seeing a woman coming before
[2:50:57] me and I don't know why it's a woman
[2:50:59] standing before me why brother it's your
[2:51:02] wife you're standing here praying for
[2:51:05] your wife I've never seen her in my life
[2:51:08] till just now but she's got some sort of
[2:51:11] trouble in her bowels and they don't
[2:51:13] know what to do don't you worry Jesus
[2:51:16] Christ is going to make her well let me
[2:51:20] say that operated by The Sixth Sense and
[2:51:24] the same Sixth Sense is in you
[2:51:27] so why don't you take control over your
[2:51:30] domain
[2:51:33] amen I got this problem no more say no
[2:51:37] more no more devil you can't occupy this
[2:51:42] mine
[2:51:44] but you must hate it
[2:51:47] [Applause]
[2:51:49] stomp it
[2:51:51] Beat It rebuke it
[2:51:54] [Applause]
[2:51:55] but we we like living with it
[2:51:59] don't live with that Saints voted out
[2:52:02] because it's not going with you
[2:52:06] Hallelujah
[2:52:08] praise the Lord
[2:52:10] can you say victory is mine
[2:52:13] victory is mine he's been up from the
[2:52:16] dead for 2 000 years and he's with us
[2:52:19] tonight
[2:52:20] then if he's with us at the time brother
[2:52:22] Brown say in 1964 where is he today
[2:52:26] where is he today where is he this
[2:52:28] morning come on don't get too
[2:52:30] intellectual on me don't overthink this
[2:52:32] one the same God that was with the
[2:52:35] prophet is now with his bride because
[2:52:38] she is the final Voice come on she is
[2:52:42] the final voice to the final age and
[2:52:46] under her messenger
[2:52:51] flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit
[2:52:54] life of his life she is him
[2:52:58] [Applause]
[2:52:59] hallelujah what is he trying to tell us
[2:53:02] things get out of this realm
[2:53:04] let's move into another round
[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:10] Hallelujah did you ever stop to think
[2:53:13] this morning as far as returning that is
[2:53:15] that he has become visible
[2:53:18] he's already here
[2:53:20] with us right now
[2:53:21] just imagine his presence as being here
[2:53:24] the Lord Jesus is in another world or
[2:53:27] another dimension but he's right here
[2:53:30] why is he right here he's a dimensional
[2:53:32] realm God
[2:53:36] he's here
[2:53:38] Elijah's God is with us today he's here
[2:53:40] not by your imagination
[2:53:43] he's here because the prophet said he's
[2:53:45] here
[2:53:46] he is here
[2:53:48] now he says
[2:53:50] the Lord Jesus is in another world or
[2:53:53] another dimension but he's right here
[2:53:55] today
[2:53:58] he's God
[2:54:00] he said well what is that how does that
[2:54:02] how does that work well who cares what
[2:54:04] you think
[2:54:06] I really don't care how you figure this
[2:54:08] one out because you can't figure it out
[2:54:11] it's my face
[2:54:15] his spirit is blending in with our
[2:54:19] spirit our eyes can't see him because
[2:54:23] they're physical yet unless there would
[2:54:25] be something happen that he could you
[2:54:28] could see him by Vision but he's here as
[2:54:31] visible and as real as he was when he
[2:54:35] spoke to Mary at the grave
[2:54:39] come on
[2:54:41] think about it that Jesus that spoke to
[2:54:44] Mary is right by you
[2:54:46] what do you have need of
[2:54:49] rabonai Mary
[2:54:52] what do you have need of listen if
[2:54:54] you've got a demon spirit this morning
[2:54:56] you should rise up and say I rebuke it
[2:54:58] in Jesus name
[2:54:59] got a physical need you should be able
[2:55:01] to rise up say I take dominion over it
[2:55:03] there's another realm that's present
[2:55:05] here this morning there is Jesus Christ
[2:55:08] the same yesterday today and forever why
[2:55:11] would you want to be with your unbelief
[2:55:13] rebuke the unbelief and say I claim it

[3:17:56] world
[3:17:57] the world
[3:17:59] right if you have a need
[3:18:02] the world goes to the world right
[3:18:06] they run to a doctor
[3:18:09] if when they find out that doctor can't
[3:18:11] help them then what do they have to do
[3:18:14] you have to go to another Realm
[3:18:18] the world has limitations
[3:18:21] God's got no limitation
[3:18:24] no limitation whatsoever not none he's
[3:18:28] got absolutely as the choir saying but
[3:18:31] but this world's got got limitations
[3:18:35] I think our trouble is so many times
[3:18:38] we go to the world
[3:18:41] when we got all the supernatural
[3:18:46] you need to look to
[3:18:48] we need to separate ourselves from the
[3:18:51] world and the things of the world
[3:18:57] you're you're in existence doesn't even
[3:19:01] come from the world
[3:19:03] the world hates you
[3:19:08] they don't even want you they're
[3:19:11] regurgitating you
[3:19:12] [Music]
[3:19:14] but I'm not of this world
[3:19:18] [Applause]
[3:19:19] I come from God yes and I go to God
[3:19:26] we are in this world
[3:19:28] but we are not of this world
[3:19:32] [Music]
[3:19:35] and maybe you find yourself this morning
[3:19:41] you don't feel you've made contact with
[3:19:44] this other Realm
[3:19:45] you know the baptism of the holy spirit
[3:19:48] is it's this realm
[3:19:51] making contact with you
[3:19:55] filling you
[3:19:58] putting it in you
[3:19:59] [Music]
[3:20:01] if you if you if you if you don't have
[3:20:06] that

[3:20:14] got World in me
[3:20:17] I got World thinking in me I've got
[3:20:19] World habits in me
[3:20:23] all you have to do is say father
[3:20:27] I don't want to be in this world
[3:20:31] I want to separate from this world
[3:20:34] and I want to have a taste of the realm
[3:20:40] what are these people jumping up and
[3:20:42] down going
[3:20:44] praise God why they make contact with
[3:20:47] the realms and if you haven't had that
[3:20:50] it's here for you to make contact with I
[3:20:53] don't I don't want to March out with the
[3:20:57] with the victors if there's one soul
[3:21:02] left that belongs in my March
[3:21:05] yep there's one person that belongs
[3:21:09] there that long and is hungry
[3:21:12] for a real experience with God
[3:21:16] religion and denominations that is
[3:21:20] Satan's
[3:21:22] counterfeit dollar bill
[3:21:24] [Music]
[3:21:26] for what's real
[3:21:28] aren't you glad we had someone show us
[3:21:31] the difference
[3:21:33] there's a formula
[3:21:37] to go from the world
[3:21:39] [Music]
[3:21:41] to the supernatural
[3:21:43] [Music]
[3:21:45] it's repent
[3:21:48] I'm sorry for the worldly things I've
[3:21:50] done
[3:21:53] not only am I sorry to him I'm sorry to
[3:21:57] you
[3:21:58] I'm sorry to all the people
[3:22:02] [Music]
[3:22:03] that I really should have been serving
[3:22:05] all this time
[3:22:06] [Music]
[3:22:08] I'm sorry Lord
[3:22:10] I repent
[3:22:12] and if you've never been baptized
[3:22:16] there's a formula that says if you'll
[3:22:19] repent
[3:22:21] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[3:22:24] Jesus Christ identifying yourself with
[3:22:28] his death burial and resurrection that
[3:22:30] you know and realize that he himself is
[3:22:34] the only one that can take you from the
[3:22:37] worldly Dimension into the Heavenly
[3:22:40] dimension
[3:22:44] and you are baptized
[3:22:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[3:22:49] made a promise
[3:22:51] he said if you repent and are baptized
[3:22:53] you shall receive the Holy Spirit
[3:22:59] you shall receive this dimension
[3:23:02] for the for those of us and you that
[3:23:06] have
[3:23:07] [Music]
[3:23:10] made that Journey
[3:23:12] [Music]
[3:23:13] why go back again
[3:23:16] you know what backflip means
[3:23:19] it means to slide back out of the
[3:23:21] spiritual Dimension back into the world
[3:23:26] back into your trust in the world your
[3:23:30] efforts in the world I thought our
[3:23:33] brother laid it out so beautiful to us
[3:23:35] this morning that this world will perish
[3:23:38] amen
[3:23:40] don't don't don't the scripture Jesus
[3:23:43] says goes on he says don't put your your
[3:23:47] Treasures on Earth well they are
[3:23:49] perishes
[3:23:50] but place your Treasures in Heaven well
[3:23:53] though neither grain moth or rust
[3:23:56] and where the thief can't break in
[3:23:59] and steal it from you right oh once you
[3:24:03] cross over he can never take it from you
[3:24:07] but it could be beautiful if we could
[3:24:10] just in our life start relying more on
[3:24:13] the supernatural
[3:24:17] world's got its limits he has none
[3:24:22] the world has to use things God's a
[3:24:25] creator
[3:24:28] he can create your healing he can create
[3:24:32] he can create everything you need
[3:24:36] foreign
[3:24:38] you have a lost loved one
[3:24:43] don't try to
[3:24:45] create some sort of scheme
[3:24:49] look to the Unseen
[3:24:52] isn't that what our brother said
[3:24:54] let's start looking
[3:24:58] to this other dimension let let the life
[3:25:03] and the word that's trying to bring this
[3:25:06] other dimension into a reality for us
[3:25:09] let us start turning all our heart there
[3:25:13] wouldn't you all agree don't let what we
[3:25:15] want for our little local assembly
[3:25:18] to be an assembly that relies on the
[3:25:21] supernatural
[3:25:24] assembly believes that God can do all
[3:25:27] things
[3:25:28] an assembly whose Hearts open for
[3:25:30] whoever would come into our midst and
[3:25:34] would like to take a drink of the
[3:25:36] Fountain of Life
[3:25:39] not a bunch of rules but an open
[3:25:42] Fountain of the Living God
[3:25:45] you can dress like the world or you can
[3:25:49] dress like somebody that's from this
[3:25:51] other dimension
[3:25:53] you want to represent
[3:25:55] as for me and my house
[3:25:57] will serve the Lord
[3:25:59] how many of you feel that way today amen
[3:26:04] Lord let the love of God be shed abroad
[3:26:07] in My Heart by the spirit
[3:26:09] necklace
[3:26:11] Supernatural dimension
[3:26:13] that her brother this morning so
[3:26:15] beautifully laid out for us Lord let
[3:26:18] that flow through me
[3:26:20] let it live out for me no man lighteth a
[3:26:24] candle
[3:26:26] put it under a basket
[3:26:28] but he setteth on a hill
[3:26:31] that it might not give light
[3:26:34] you believe in the Supernatural
[3:26:37] let's show the world
[3:26:41] that the Supernatural is available to
[3:26:43] them
[3:26:44] if you're here this morning
[3:26:48] and you know that you're not in
[3:26:52] this heavenly place
[3:26:55] you're not here we're a rapture
[3:26:59] is going to take place
[3:27:03] if you find yourself on the other side
[3:27:05] of the line
[3:27:07] and you haven't passed from Death unto
[3:27:10] life
[3:27:12] and you feel this morning
[3:27:15] that if brother Tom and the ministers
[3:27:19] prayed for you
[3:27:21] all right
[3:27:24] it would make a difference
[3:27:26] then we want to give you that
[3:27:28] opportunity
[3:27:30] I'm not talking about you got a need and
[3:27:33] you want to better this or a better that
[3:27:35] you have access I'm talking about
[3:27:37] someone that doesn't know
[3:27:40] that they know in their heart
[3:27:43] they're not part
[3:27:45] of this dimension
[3:27:49] and they want to cross over
[3:27:52] from Death unto life
[3:27:57] I offer you that opportunity
[3:28:00] like Jesus offered the young man he said
[3:28:03] thou lacketh one thing
[3:28:05] that you sell all that I have
[3:28:09] so all that you have and come follow me
[3:28:13] if you're here in that condition this
[3:28:15] morning
[3:28:17] and you'd like to follow him
[3:28:22] you'd like to give your heart
[3:28:25] and Surrender Your Life
[3:28:28] and have him come
[3:28:31] and take his Abode in you
[3:28:34] we want to give you that opportunity
[3:28:39] because I don't want to March out
[3:28:41] without you
[3:28:43] I don't want to Rapture without you oh
[3:28:45] God
[3:28:47] [Music]
[3:28:49] don't put it off if it's here if God's
[3:28:52] dealing with your heart
[3:28:54] if you know that you're not saved this
[3:28:56] morning
[3:28:58] and you know if he would come this
[3:29:01] afternoon
[3:29:02] that you'd be left
[3:29:06] don't be ashamed
[3:29:11] because every man that's ever come into
[3:29:14] this Kingdom
[3:29:16] has had to walk out of the world
[3:29:19] and make a public confession
[3:29:22] that I've accepted Jesus Christ as my
[3:29:25] personal savior
[3:29:29] if you believe and you haven't had the
[3:29:32] spirit
[3:29:33] and you want the spirit of God in your
[3:29:35] life you can do the same thing just look
[3:29:38] to the Unseen
[3:29:40] this one has seen that this morning
[3:29:43] if anybody who's outside
[3:29:46] of the kingdom of God
[3:29:50] and outside of the security of the blood
[3:29:53] of the Lamb
[3:29:55] and opportunity
[3:29:59] to come to life the gift of God is
[3:30:03] eternal life
[3:30:06] through Christ Jesus let's just sing it
