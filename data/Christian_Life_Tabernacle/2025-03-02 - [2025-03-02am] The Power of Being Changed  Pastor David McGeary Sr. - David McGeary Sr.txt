word to us that we could live and and we are so grateful for that we ask you to bless us this morning as we Fellowship around your word father we ask you to bless the visitors that may be among us father and all that have come together father they're all your children you know what they have need of and we certainly ask you to touch them that they could walk out and in their hearts say it was good to be in the house of the Lord we ask you to bless us now in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you let's open our scriptures and we'll read just a scripture and and then uh we'll uh uh sit down and read some more scriptures okay so uh I i' like to start with John uh 1 John 4 and 17 1 John 4 and 17 and this is uh uh kind of our our theme or if I could say it this way this is our goal um so I think EV every Christian uh should have something that they're striving for uh don't you believe that you know if you don't have something you're striving for then you're you're still but we found out one thing from the word of God that there's no still you're either going forward or you're going backwards so uh uh so that we think it yes it says and and this is what it says in St John uh 4:17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world Amen May the father bless his word this precious name we pray amen you may be seated let's just read that next verse for comfort there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out all fear because fear hath torment and he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us amen amen so we just want to continue on in in the word of the Lord and uh this morning if I uh the what I'd like to entitle this the power of being changed the power of being changed and I thought uh brother Davey uh preached uh Wednesday night such a subject right down along these same lines and it really was a blessing to me and I felt bad for brother Tim this morning because the family was sick but uh he's our Sunday super uh school superintendent and you just saw a pretty good idea of uh all that he's taking care of back there so I want to give a shout out to him he should certainly be proud of all the Sunday School teachers and all their coordination for our young people we have a promise right if we teach them in the way that they'll go you know what I mean and you show them the way they'll return back to it and and uh that's what our desire is for each of our children because I don't know why they just seem to uh uh at that certain age you know I don't know if it's on their 13th birthday or or whatever it is you know they just got that desire to have their own independence and go out and you know we want to keep right on top of them you know CU we don't want them to be like we were you know what I mean so uh so maybe sometimes we get a little hard and a little rigid but we do have a promise that that God gave them to us we gave them back to him and he'll take care of them so uh we are really proud of our Sunday school children well you know um I guess a lot of what's uh transpiring in the things that I'm preaching are maybe a lot of it motivated because of the things that I'm uh personally going through in my life I'm uh I I know that I'm I'm going through uh a a cycle or a certain time in your life there's just periods in your life where things make changes and uh as you know uh my mother uh lived to the grand old age of 102 uh I remember taking her to Michigan uh when she was 101 years old and um so they kept trying to get her through security and um and they kept coming up on the computer she was one year old and um you know lesie was there saying well no she's not one you know she's a hundred and one and they wouldn't let her through and uh I thought maybe they thought she's a terrorist but uh she was trying to deceive them you know to get in there and do something so back they went and back they went and finally somebody there came and and walked her through you know but nobody wanted to make a decision you know what it me nobody wanted to take on any responsibility and uh uh just uh simple things uh I I I and uh so we're in the process now of selling my mother's house so I've had to make a few trips to California to sell my mother's house and I realized that I'm coming to an end of an eror in my life that that when and you know we went out there and we just sat around the house you know me and my brothers and sisters we all grew up there and we would we would go over uh all kinds of thoughts in our mind how can we keep this house and and we don't want to let it go and you know but you know we we can't live in two places you know and I think well you know maybe I could retire and just move out to San Diego and just live in my mom's house you know then of course my brother says well yeah give me my part and you can do that you know I I thought we'd all just keep the house you know and and so I realize that that when that transpires that whole world is gone to me uh I lost my father and it and I remember uh all the connections that uh I had I remember in my life I always knew uh even though I was you know 50 years old I I always knew in my heart I could go to my dad you know what I mean if something uh I had a financial situation or something or I got in some bad trouble I knew my dad would be there for me and I remember going down the road and realizing that wasn't there anymore for me and I remember the day and I just stopped and I looked up and I said I'm so glad I still have you my heaven L father you know what I mean and I lost my Earthly connection but it brought me closer to my heavenly connection and I I I knew I still had a father God used that father for a season to give me that Comfort but now that that was gone I had to go to another place to find that Comfort to find that peace you know to to find that security and and I I believe that that there's a reason that all these things has happened I mean I my mother lived long Beyond normal and you normally go through these things a lot earlier but uh just going through th these things and and a lot of things have been transpired transpiring in me physically uh with my age and and so I realized that there there there's a lot of changes taking place in me and it's brought me to uh that message God's power to change that God's power to transform and that's what transformation is it means to change something from what it is to something else and as we as we begin to preach on um this subject um we realize that all creation is based on change it's it's based on change and so let's just go back while you're seated and read a a few more uh uh scriptures found in Romans the eth chapter and uh uh Romans 8 is a great chapter to continually go back and read to fortify yourself and uh uh uh make strong your foundation because this is what we're built on and it's got great uh scriptures in here like for the carnal mind is death but the spiritual mind is life and peace so uh uh so we want to draw this contrast there's a spiritual mind there's a carnal mind right and so we always have these two every Revival has twins every uh the garden there was twins Jesus and Judas Jacob and Esau you go all down through the time you will always see right or wrong good or evil light and dark Ness you know uh sin and and righteousness you know fear and faith love and hate it there there's always a two things side by side and if you could use that thought two opinions there's two ways of looking at things two paths to take you know we sing that song I believe there's two paths that you can take one by sight and one by faith so we have these two great paths we have these two opposing forces we have these two things and it's always it always uh lies there and the the worst place a person can be is to be halted between two opinions you understand like halt you know if a guy if you're walking on a military base maybe Philip and some of our old Soldiers remember this brother Jerome if somebody said Hal what did you do yes sir yes sir you stopped you know cuz if it was a Watchman you know he he had a rifle you know I worked in some top secret areas in the government uh when they were designing the moon rover and when they were testing the the U2 plane the one that flew and took things and I worked in the photo lab that developed the the the Spy films and everything and they told us if somebody says halt immediately stop and so if and that's what if you you say halted that means you got you're Frozen between two opinions okay so you're paralyzed and therefore if you become paralyzed you're not moving you're not going for uncertainty does that to you you know which voice is Right which path is right and and you come there it it's like uh sitting at a restaurant with somebody that can't make up their mind what to eat you know you know just order something and if you don't like it we'll buy something else but at least get my order in you you know what I'm saying so okay I want you to get that established in your mind that the poison is to be stopped right okay so he he makes this little in the sixth verse one is and but the spiritual mind is life and peace but the carnal mind is imity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither can it be and then we read down the 11th verse it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh so we have two spirit man right and we have Spirit man we are not debtors to the flesh we owe nothing to to the fleshly man we owe nothing to the carnal mind we owe nothing to carnal thinking or the world now the world wants us to think that we owe them something they like to think that they're providing for you but let me tell you what the spiritual mind says I've never seen a righteous man beg bread you know the father look consider the lies of the field how they neither toil nor nor snare or or or spin or so consider them the birds of the air and yet the father taketh care of them aren't you so much greater than they are and so you you you have to understand that you can't get stuck in between two opinions you can't get stuck under two Pathways this is is an hour more than ever that you've got to move forward and it said so uh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but through the spirit if you mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God You' got to choose whom you're going to serve the prophet said you choose this day who you're going to serve but as for me in my house we're going to serve the Lord well you don't make that choice if you don't fully believe in the benefits Satan got Eve to Halt between two opinions what he said and what God Said and that battle is still going on today Satan uses the same tactics on every believer that he used on Eve God says something he SS something else and he tries to paralyze you between those two thoughts and they're so close sometimes together that you will waste in eternity trying to uh trying to decipher it we're trying to make sense out of it trying to fit it together so we don't want again we want to not be stuck he said for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint hires with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present times are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US amen and then we could drop down to the 22nd verse it says so we we see in that verse that there's suffering and there's heartaches and there's trials because we have these two worlds that that we live in I I believe I I been I tried to put it in a visual form for us by saying we have two puzzles right and the and there's in in these two puzzles there's two pictures and I could put it like this way there were the puzzles were pictures of Eden one puzzle was the God's Eden the other puzzle was Satan's Eden and they both had pieces but what happened was is that the piece puzzle pieces got mixed together and and everybody's been and only one picture was presented and that was Satan's Eden but now in our day the seals were open the Mysteries were uh made known and the prophet of God put it this way he says now God's mindful of us again so he chose in this day to reveal H the first Eden to us and let us know that we are not pieces of Satan's Eden but we are pieces of God's picture his Eden so we we understand that there's a battle between that because we are born in sin came is shaped iniquity came in the world speaking lies our flesh has contact through five senses and emotional sensus is to this world but God gave us a six s which was faith that we could believe what he said because the Bible is a book of promises and if you if you if something's promised to to you then you hope for it hope isn't bad you look for it you you're in expectation of its coming but if you doubt and you doubt that that promis is to you and you doubt that that promis is for you that's all satan needs to do to get you to miss it to get you to stop and not go forward into the promise not take the promise and let it change you and so he says he goes on he says for now we know the the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together till now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemptions of our bodies so you got to see the early church is is suffering through all the anxieties and pain of living in this Eden longing for that chain so much that they even cried out even so come quickly Lord Jesus and they begin to question where is the sign of his coming where is his appearing see they're always trying to get you uh to reason always trying to get you to consider always trying to hold you in that middle ground what if that's what Satan said surely you won't die considered reason and if he can get you in that spot of reasoning then he stopped you you can't go forward and and so let's just finish real quick he said he says for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for when a man seeth why does he yet hope for it but if we hope for that what we see not then do we with patience wait for it oh that's a sermon right there hold on be certain of God if he promised it you can hope for it and if you have hope then you'll wait with patience for it amen they work together likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered for he that searcheth the heart knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for a good to them that love God to them who are the called we read that sometimes and we say uh you know all things work together for the good to them that are called or you know but just just uh it it's so beautiful he says we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who to them who are you who I'm who Amen to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first fruits among many Brethren amen I wanted to continue reading but we'll stop there this morning so we realize that the calling of God had a purpose and the purpose purpose is that we be conformed or transformed into the image of his son now let me say this Satan does not want you to stop believing okay he doesn't care if you stop [Music] believing but what he wants to stop and he wants you to stop transforming he wants you to stop changing he you know he that that's what that he wants to stop so he doesn't want to stop you from believing he doesn't want to as we preached last uh Sunday he doesn't care if you recognize but we want to go beyond recognition so in other words there's a purpose of our election or if we could say that there's a purpose that the seed of God is in us and so we know that God put everything in us to be successful everything that you need to be successful is in you and a few Sundays ago we ministered that there we found out that all the keys to success remember the two Edens so Satan wants you to be successful in his Eden God wants you to be successful in his Eden they both have power if you can have a carnal mind you can be very powerful in this present world they're all talking now about oh you know who's smart and who's not and Eline musk is the smartest man in the world let me tell you if you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ you are a whole lot smarter right you know they they want to shoot a man to Mars they can have Mars the only Mars I ever wanted was in a little rapper do they still make the old Mars Bar come on what man calls great God calls foolish I I'm going to I'm going to blow past Mars and Saturn and every other place I'm going to a land Beyond a river I'm going to a supernatural Kingdom I am an original astronaut you know I I am not even of this world I'm just so joury down here that God might manifest all his wonderful attributes in me and and I I I'm just I'm sorry uh I don't have a a need to build a kingdom here but Satan he wanted a kingdom is that right this is this is what this is how the uh prophet of God described that uh like this he said uh see if I can find that the statement real quick I always have these statements and then when I go to look for them I can't find them so uh that's part of that age difficulty that I'm I'm telling you about so uh well anyway brother BM says that uh but Satan wanted to start start his edting so he he came down and and he's he's wanted to build his Eden is that right so he he since he couldn't create he could only deform or pervert so he took every principle for success and remember we went through them in the scripture we we give what they said was a principle for success and then we go over and find that scripture in the word of God but one's using it for one Kingdom and one's using it for the other one is taking the glory for himself the other is giving the glory to the Lord and so that's what Satan did is he came down here to build his Eden that he might exalt himself oh I just wish I could uh find that uh statement because the prophet of God puts it so uh beautifully uh in the word of God here he says so Satan's purpose from Eden was to make his own Eden to exalt himself above so the stars of God would worship Him Sons would worship him and he has absolutely carried it out now and when he's done this he brought it into the church so that was his purpose is to build an Eden and so we found out that God put everything in his son to be successful but when he created you he didn't create you in your full Perfection he put a seed in you and that seed in you the whole law of creation is transformation the plan of creation was seed to fruit seed to maturity that was how that God placed it and so we see even in Civilization right from horse and buggy to walking to horse and buggy to to a carriage to a car uh to plane to Rocket and on so all those things are always here but as civilization grew and man uh begin to want to be more successful they begin to search and they they they looked at science and they look at civilization and they looked at education and Satan be to build his Eden he begin to he begin to uh uh these these characteristics that God had put in man man begin to tap on those things but use them for the wrong thing but what we understand is we understand that that the the whole picture of creation is change is transformation right have you ever seen a a tomato what they call a set it's a little teeny dinky thing that comes in a little cup and you can go buy them in trays I probably maybe the Tomato Farmers amongst us anybody grow tomatoes nobody grows tomatoes I'm glad I got a friend that grows Tomatoes cuz he brings us some of the best tomatoes but you put out it's a little square thing and you put it in your house and it grows and it gets bigger and you take it out well it didn't start you didn't start with tomatoes but when you put that little seed in the ground you looked at that and you believe there was tomatoes in that now can you imagine looking at this little twig and say look at my tomatoes but they're there the prophet of God said every fruit that that tree would ever bring forth was in that seed everything everyone was in there and and that seed had within itself the power to transform itself from what God created it to be to carry out the intentions of and purpose of what God put there it didn't have to go outside God provided the water he provided the Sun and provided the Earth he provided everything for that seed to go he put all that into place before he put the seed there now that seed has within itself the power to transform into what God wanted it to be is that right so we we understand that that's that's what the the the great understanding is of the believer now Satan knows that about you so he's not trying to keep you from believing he's trying to keep you from changing from transforming to move into that fruit that you're supposed to bear and and have you ever walked through a bunch of tomatoes as they begin to mature all kinds of things start showing up on them have you ever seen one of them big fat I I don't know what they're called they potato worms or whatever they are they're big ugly gigantic fat little cat uh caterpillar creatures some of you know they show up and and little MIT show up and little holes start coming in the leaves and and grasshoppers come and it goes through all kinds of suffering but it doesn't say oh I got a great big caterpillar sucking on me a great big slug a great Big Worm I'm going to quit producing Tomatoes it doesn't say oh my tomato plant isn't perfect and every leaf isn't perfect and and and everything isn't exactly the way that it should be I guess I'm just not going to produce Tomatoes it'll produce Tomatoes I don't care how bad it looks the journey the plan of creation is from seed to fruit and that tomato plant will struggle through every one of those sufferings through every one of those challenges it'll continually work towards producing that tomato because that's what it was created to do and Satan's trying to do in type to try to do everything he can do to keep that thing from producing Tomatoes just think of it if you can understand that everything that's going on in the world the natural is a type of the spiritual every struggle every challenge everything that you meet and you battle is because of these two Edens because Satan is trying to put into us and stop us from transforming into the image of his son because there there's power with change overcoming really is the change it's almost a change that takes place in your mind it it you you know when when you overcome you you come down see if I can find that one I had it marked but my little thing fell out of my book oh I can just preach to you you guys can go home and read it you already read it right what did the prophet of God say he said if you think this world is good and you and you like the Fashions of the world and you like the things of this world and you like this Kingdom and you like the science and you like the civilization he says your thinking is wrong that's right and that's where the battle is the battle is to get us to be halted between two opinions stuck between two voices to to one is to uh uh and Satan is is still telling us if you do this if you do this if you be like this if you do this you'll be successful I hear so many people say I need to be a better businessman I need to go take business classes I need to find yourself success no you don't you tell me one thing that education can do that Faith can't tell me one thing he said all things are possible to them that believe I will not leave you I'll not forsake you but I'll be with you even in you till the end I'll keep you a Shepherd looks after his flock he keeps things out of your life that's not good for you I remember a man sat down with me one time he said brother mcgar I've been spiritually blessed here I said I'm glad brother I'm I got married here I raised my children here but I've never had financial success so I'm going to move to where I can be financially successful I said why would you want to do that don't you know the love of money is the root of all evil don't you know it's harder for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven don't you know that he who builds his treasures up here is attached to those treasures and tries to protect those treasures and he doesn't want to lose them don't you know that's poison to your mind we don't need more education we don't need no more money we need more faith we need to take God at his word and Satan will do everything he can to transform [Music] belief into Power that's what he's trying to stop he's glad you believe William Mary and Brandon was the prophet of God he's glad that you believe that he fulfilled Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 he knows that he did that he's not opposed to that he's opposed to the effect that that will have on you if you allow it to transform you Satan's afraid of your change because as you grow and as you change your possibilities increase you take baseball you can look at a great baseball player today one time he was out there as a peeeeeee player you know out in the Outfield I've seen them throw their glove out and sit down and draw circles and and the parents are going get up get ready they got girl showed up for game in a ballerina Tootsie that that if that person had the talent in them the talent was there but it had to change and as it got older it changed and as it changed the possibilities became greater he saw better he ran quicker he did that he grew into all those things and all he had to do was fight through the opposition fight through the injuries fight through the Mind battles fight through the pain but if he had that ability in him it was always there you have the ability in you to be like Jesus that's our goal look okay Satan is always going to accuse you he's the accuser of the Brethren he's always going to point his finger at you he's always going to bring something up he's always going to bring to your remembrance things that you did it's what he does he always is going to accuse you of being a sinner of being short of being why because if you change the world around you changes when you change what you perceive changes it's like the first day on a job you don't know where anything is you feel out of place you're looking for something to do nobody's really got time for you now you just don't say nobody loves me I'm going to quit this job you'll be looking for a job all your life you got to what grow into the job you find your place you get an understanding of how things work and every time you get you get a a change that whole job changes for you and the possibilities change for you and then you're saying I can do this and pretty soon you're saying I can run this company and pretty soon you're saying I can start my own company because change change in you changes the world around you you understand that change in your heart change in your nature changeing your mind will change the world that you're living in it'll change everything as you transform things around you transform as you become more like him you get more to the place the works that I do shall you do also as you change and become more like him the possibility of the supernatural becomes more real to you cuz all creation was built on change it started from void and dark and he moved upon it and changed it and then he divided he changed it he changed night and day everything is change change transformation and if God ever does one thing one way he has to continually to do it so it never was I'm going to accept the Lord Jesus as my savior and I'm going to step up and now I'm born saved sealed and everything you're in seed form and you're growing the word's in there but the spirit's what quickening it the quickening of the spirit is not an anointing feeling the quickening of the spirit is not an Enlightenment the quickening of the spirit is a change to your nature and as you change the the world changes around you here's this person over here and I guess JJ this is your seat so this is nothing personal but I can't stand this guy I don't like the way he plays I don't like the way he sits I don't like the color of his hair I don't like those big beautiful brown eyes I don't like those bushy eyebrows just can't stand them my goodness how did he get on the platform and I'm the pastor oh but you let the spirit Quicken something in your heart and all of a sudden JJ changes did JJ change no my whole world changed I come out the door over there and I come over here and uh of course Joy's not with us I I I come up here and I thought my goodness gracious man this guy's dressed sharp today you know he's going to have an eye of a lady on him pretty quick fact he might might just have somebody in mind already maybe he knows they're watching this morning your world changes your possibility changes all of a sudden you hear him play and you go oh I love that I love that he's playing the same everything's the same nothing has ch changed but everything has changed your whole world changes and with change comes power you understand that God has the power to make the change but when the change is made you are indued with the power that made the change do you understand that when the change takes place in that fruit the life that came up from that tree now that life has gone into the fruit the power that brought it from seed to fruit is now in the fruit that's why Satan don't want you to change he knows God's got the power to transform but he knows if you let that power change you now you possess the power that changed you how many have been changed by the spirit of God Amen when you got changed by the spirit of God you possess that spirit that changed you [Music] hallelujah we're not fighting we're fighting against powers and principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places you know what we're fighting against we're fighting against the lie that's what we're fighting against I got to find this one so just bear with me because I I'll just have to I I've got a I I've this this really will help help me uh okay so he's got to he fights against the LIE right so your name was always written on the Lamb's Book of Life did you know that before there ever was a star in the sky God knew you he knew you he saw the color of your hair or the color of the sides of your head he saw every bit of it the statue would come in the shape you would be here he knew you van and then in his thinking he planted you right the word that produced the seed the seed was in the word and the word spoke and it came to play but he didn't put you here in the form that he saw you he put you in your great great grandfather is that right and he went and got your great great grandmother and arranged for him to meet your great great grandfather and they me and then your parents meant and then here you are God orchestrated all that to get you here you're not saved from predestination you're not saved from this world you're saved from the lie that said that you're not the Sons and Daughters of God you always were the sons and daughters of God but the lie was you never can make it you never can mature you were born in sin I'm going to keep keep uh showing you all your failures all your faults all your misery I'm going to get keep keeping your eyes and all your doubts and all your fears CU if you ever get a hold of the fact that you're a predestinated child of God and you accept that change Satan's got trouble when when you finally stop and say Satan get behind me you are a liar you are the father of all lies and there's no truth in you when you're ready to sit back and say I'm ready for the changes that God wants to make in my life because if he starts making those changes in my mind in my spirit I will be empowered with the changes that he makes in me and now I'll start spreading that abroad listen to what he said he says now the word there is not Earth it's the Greek word Cosmos which means the world's order if we love fashion of the Earth the world and we love the trends of the day if we think this is a wonderful time and oh we have all these things if you think that it's because your thinking is wrong it's perverted by the devil for if we love the world's order and the things of this present world it's because the love of God is not even in you remember that oh god look what we're looking into I want to stop here just a few momentes he's going to tell a story like Satan at the beginning when he come into the Garden of Eden he could not dig up those seeds hallelujah what God has planted he will water day and night he'll do it Prophet I'm so glad that God's mindful of us again he had to seow the word he had to wait for we grew up to the place that we could understand that God's got a change for us and we've been hoping for that change we call it the rapture we call it the translation but that is going on now he's translating you changing you and empowering you right now he's got to start creating the change in his church the change of their thinking the change of their desire the change of their hope the change of their strength the change of their Reliance he's got to get the fear out what happens if I don't get a job what happens if you don't get a job God will take care of me now if you're a lazy bum you know I mean you won't take any job you go home and dream of a $50 an hour job instead of walking down to McDonald's and cooking french fries will shame on you go to McDonald's cook french fries you might just be in there cooking fries and some guy say Hey you come here you walk yes sir he says what are you doing here cooking french fries well you know I'm looking for a job but instead of being a bum I I'm just praying and asking the Lord Jesus to give me a job and I'm going to testify to these people while I'm here I'm going to be happy I'm going to be thankful for what I got I'm going to be thankful for my health and he said well I got a job you want to come work for me yes sir I do I'm going to give my two weeks notice I'm going to take enough showers to wash all this french fry out of me and I'll be there in the job what happened why did we quit believing in a god like that why did we quit believing in the Supernatural why do we quit believing that our lives got ordered by the Lord what's happened to us why did we become afraid of change he couldn't dig up them seeds he could not destroy them but he sprayed them with poison and it deformed the seed and it didn't bring forth the right corn form he deformed The Original Seed well what are we going back to spoken word is the Original Seed we're returning back to the original seed and if we turn back to the original seed we return back to the original Fruit and God's here to transform us back into the original but the original is nothing like we got in our minds or in our possibilities we've got to start changing because there's power in change when you change you start seeing him for what he is when you put Faith where fear is where you put love where doubt is you become empowered that was the alarm to tell me to stop you can't be afraid of change tonight's communion maybe some of you live a long ways I understand that you can't make it back we've tried to provide the fellowship hall my homes have available if you need to stay but there's a lot of people that only believe in one service fine a lot of people won't come back but my question is what's keeping you gas Old-Timers used to put a gallon in gas and drive to a meeting 300 miles away did that die no people got to where they didn't want to take the chance they just couldn't believe it's them that God could do it for if he did it for anybody else he'll do it for you I know a man that left his State left his job left his home and everything just to come so he could have communion and he got in town with no work no money couldn't pay his rent couldn't do nothing broke as a hound dog and the only thing Satan sat on his doorstep every day saying boy did you make a mistake you fool you gave all that up for communion oh we don't want to sacrifice we don't want to make change but let me tell you something the Sheep sheep and the goats are being divided the Rapture is a change it's the greatest change and the Hope we've been looking for you've got to make the changes along the way maybe you just might this afternoon consider what changes you have to make in your thinking about communion and about the house of the Lord and about the church and about the body because if you don't change you're going backwards and we've got to understand we can not be afraid of changing our hearts changing our Spirits changing our thinkings changing the way we are God is fixing to change his church man has come up with anointing substitutes they've come up with blessings they've come up with refilling they come up with a moving of the Holy Spirit that's all good but God's looking for a deeper change he's looking for this inner man he's looking for this fruit he's looking for a deep change within the change of our heart the change of our mind the change of our nature the Chang is on brothers and sisters the change is on God bless you brother Billy man let's all stand this morning man how many desire change this morning amen Lord I I don't want to continue in my old ways I hear the word of God this morning it calls
