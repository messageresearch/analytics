Description:
Watchnight Service 2024
December 31, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and ask this amen amen God bless you want to welcome everyone in the house of God and may be seated as you invite Brother David at this time amener good evening tonight I just um I felt to as we leave this Mark on our calendars and we we start to move forward into um uh 20 uh 25 uh we realize that the scripture tells us that we're living in perilous times and there's uh and the deception this is the greatest age of deceptions there ever been and also we realize that modernism is is begin to flood into the church and uh uh and the the standard of what Christianity was has become more obscure and more obscure and as the church becomes more modern and nowadays most uh church is almost a concert if uh if you would to go uh and be on the Internet or online or watch a a television program or something uh from one of the churches it's mostly about singing and and and then at the end of the singing the preacher come up and make a few comments or a few jokes and then it's back to the concert I like to play about 40 minutes this evening at right at the start of our service and then after we listen to this then we'll have song service testimony and everything but uh if I I would one of the subtitles to the the tape that we're going to listen to it is the deceived Church by the world and uh and then a subtitle which is uh kind of correlates with it is uh why the church has lost its power and how to get it back and so uh we're not going to start with all the scriptures and the introductory but we're just going to start where brother Brandon picks up his sermon and and a lot of what that we're wanting to do is to in our thinking and in our life reestablish the dedication and and reestablish the sincerity and reestablish and that's a lot of times what you do at this time of year you take the time to reestablish you know what I mean uh you know a lot of people go on their January diet you know what I mean or they they they do their their January at the health club or or whatever because they try to reestablish but they can't keep it going but I really think that you'll enjoy listening to this and uh I can just tell you it's straight it's straightforward it's uh it it's down to some of the very deepest ABCs that the prophet of God believed and it's a part of our foundation so what we're going to listen to is what this message was built on it was the heart and the mind and the dedication of a prophet towards the things of God so as we we'll just listen to this for 40 minutes then brother Billy will lead us in songs and specials testimony then we'll have communion and probably be uh out by 12:30 1:00 so if you get real tired just go ahead and yawn and stretch but let's just enjoy the evening so I'd like to end this year and start this service with the voice of our messenger so God bless you as we listen to our prophet Samson great deal likeed the church started off right he started off in the right direction he started off and was called a mighty man of veiler he started out serving the lord in keeping his words and doing his Commandments and that was somewhat like the church it started off on as we would say as a world expression started on the right foot started to keep the Commandments of the Lord and as long as Samson followed the Lord the Lord you Samson for God can keep anyone and use anyone that will follow after him for it's God's business but when we turn to a side away from the things of God then God cannot use us any longer when we'll walk steadfastly after the Commandments of God when we'll stay in the pages of the Bible and worship by the written WR Word Worship Him in the spirit and in the truth of the word then God can use any individual but when they take a notion to turn aside after something else then God cannot use that person any longer so Samson makes a a a very outstanding representation of the Church of today day when the church started God could use the church for the church walked diligently after the Commandments of the Lord kept all of his judgments and his statutes and done all of his Commandments and God was with the church but it seems to be that there is such a weakening place amongst the church Church remember we are not on a picnic but we are in a battlefield many people just think that when they become a Christian that that's all they need to do that that settles it forever if they are a Christian then everything's going to come easy don't never get that in your hand for I become a Christian to fight fight the good fight of faith I become a Christian to get in the battle lines we are Christian Soldiers and we've got to be trained and brought up and know all the technques of the enemy to know how to fortified to know how to to fight the fight and we can only do that as a holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other Nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the Holy Spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the Commander in Chief of the army of the Christians prise God Samson did good he was a great man until he begin to begin to kind of we would call it SC wag around until he began to get off of his own territory and the church did run well and was all right until they begin to get off of their territory Samson begin to flirt and he was not flirting with Israel Li his girls he begin to Ft with aistin girls and that's somewhat similar to what the church did it never began to make love with its own it got off after unbelievers and begin to flirt with unbelievers that's where we made our great and one of the greatest mistakes as when the church begin to do things that wasn't right it begin to keep like Samson Bad Company Samson as long as he was in the company of the Lord's people he did all right but when he got to flirting with Bad Company then he got in trouble and that's the way it is with the church when the church followed reverently and daily after the leading of the Holy Spirit God blessed them and miracles and signs and wonders followed the the church but when he begin to keep Bad Company with the world one of the worst things that done and the first things that done it begin to organize breaking up Fellowship amongst other believers because it found out that nations were organized but this great gospel is is not dedicated to One Nation or one people it's dedicated to whosoever will let him come all nations kindreds tongues and people God never did intend for us to draw boundary lines but man wanted to be like they compare or to copy after go like the the world does say the things that they do make a success the way they were a success we cannot never be a success doing anything the world does we can only be a success as we follow after God's statutes and his way of doing things we can never be byass in after the world if the cigarette company has met their greatest success by television and the beer and the whiskey crowds has made their great success through the contribution of Television that's no sign that the church shall make his success by television the success of the church lies within the preaching of the Gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the spirit praise God we cannot say because that television done such and such for the cigarette company and the and the other companies we do not have any Scripture to try to compare with them people and as long as we do we may draw great numbers of people but that's not what God ordained us to do amen we think because that we're all colors flying high great organizations causing great colorful things to take place that it's a success we are dying daily on our feet spiritually speaking if we stood 10 million strong this morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't with us we'd do well to stand tend strong with the holy spirit with usen we cannot compare with the world one of the first things was the church begin to organize themselves the first organization was the Catholic church and then come the Lutheran Church when they organized in the Catholic church to make it an organization one day there was a cry the Philistines is on the Samson and Samson broke the cords of the bounds of the Catholic church and Martin Luther came forth amen with the organizations then they bound the church with another card as Delia did and they begin instead of having God call man men who were called by the Holy Spirit maybe didn't know their ABCs but they know Christ amen then the church got stylished and fashioned after the political speakers and they had to give their preachers doctor's degree everybody had to be a doctor of divinity that was another card Divine the church man go off and study each Seminary tries to produce a better scholar so that their churches can brag our pastor is a doctor of divinity what did they do one try to have more knowledge than the other well that doesn't mean anything in the sight of God and there's no need for any man to try to take his worldly knowledge and ever please God with it it's an abomination in the sight of God you'll never please God with the worldly Ambitions and knowledge because it's imity to God says the scriptures he cannot do it and each one tries to have all the knowledge they know just what to do and the words to say and it becomes just a political speech in instead of a powerly demonstrated Holy Spirit message that Saints to the heart of man and discovers the sins prise God they're trained for a political talks and we don't need that Paul said the word come to us not only of the gospel and word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost amen that brought the gospel demonstrating the powers of the Holy Ghost po but all these men go off the seminaries and they learn great educations how they must stand before the people how they must present themselves how they must dress and how they must act they should never use the wrong grammar now that's all right for a political speech but we are not after the enchanting words of M Paul said the gospel that I preached didn't come like that but it come through the renewing of the the holy ghost in the power of demonstrations amen come Hallelujah by a right formed speech praise God that your wisdom would be or your trust would be in the wisdom of man but it come through the demonstrations of the power of the re in Christ Hallelujah that's the gospel Amen to know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah praise God each one tries to think he's a little smarter than the other man each denomination the Methodist will say we got the smartest man the Baptist will say and the Church of Christ and so forth they all we we're the smartest we our our people we don't let just the ordinary man go out and preach the gospel but they handpick them oh God have mercy handpick them if they're indument with their certain Doctrine then they put them in the church God can't touch them in no way amen I want somebody to preach to me that's been handpicked by the Holy Ghost God has raised up Hallelujah not picked by man are denominations all knowledge they say oh we know all about it and some of them doesn't know the first alphabet of the Holy Spirit they deny it it reminds me of a little book I read one day in California about 10 years ago I picked it up in an old bookstore I forget who was the author just a little T sent book but it had some good sense to it though it seemed jokingly and cunningly but I found something in there that sounded like God to me and one of the little stories started out like this one morning in a great chicken pin there was a certain little r that thought he had had all the knowledge that there was to be no one so he FS up on a box and beat his little bill against the Box four or five times threw back his little head and crowed like you never heard of rooster crow and the others he attracted their attention and he said ladies and gentlemen of this chicken pin I would like to speak to you all this morning on some great educational program we have just designed said I have required a lot of knowledge in my studying as he pulled his little glasses over his bill and he said I have decided that we chickens can better ourselves by more knowledge therefore I can tell you that where if we will dig and work in a certain pin or hole we'll find a certain vitamin that'll make us Crow better prettier feathers and oh I can tell you how we can EMB better ourself and many different ways and the little pullets with their little red Combs they just cackled and said isn't he a darling and they certainly admired him oh he is such a brilliant rooster reminds me of some of these your Seminary preachers such a brilliant man there's no need of us hanging around the rest of chickens we all ought to go with him well before the little fell got his speech finished there was another little chicken that didn't have such bright feathers come running in from the rest of the chicken yard and said boy is just a minute I just heard the latest bulletin on the radio chickens went up 4 cents on the pound we're all going to the slaughter tomorrow what good your knowledge going to do brother all the knowledge that we can accumulate what good does it do we're six foot of dirt amen we're all dying by inches and by our knowledge means nothing we want to know him but they do that as I was remarking some time ago about a certain little Canary and he thought he know all the knowledge that it need to be known and he knowed so much that he could tell all the rest of the canaries about the human beings so he flies up on his cage and he begins to speak about the human beings how he knowed all about them and all of a sudden a professor from Purdue walked up and begin to speak some high polished words to him and the little fell batted his eyes and turned his head now he had eyes he could see the professor he had ears he could hear him but of course he didn't know what he was talking about why he's got a canary brain he's just a bird brain that's all he's got he hasn't got a human brain so he can't think like human beings and neither can a human being think like God Amen you're human all the worldly knowledge is no more than a canary brain amen all you do you just hurt yourself with it God you got to have the mind of Christ Hallelujah the reason people go and join organizations and substitute a handshake instead of the new birth they're trying to bypass the new birth they don't want the new birth and the they know we teach it in the Bible so they want to substitute something for it and the Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they want it in class this must be just so classy we'll shake hands and join the church and be sprinkled or baptize or something they're afraid of the new birth I sometimes believe the Brandon Tabernacle is getting afraid of it am now we all know that a birth I don't care where it is or what where abouts it's a mess if a baby's born on a shuck pile on a hard floor or in a peak decorated hospital room it's a mess anyhow amen a birth of a calf birth of anything else is a mess and the new birth is nothing less than a mess amen but people so starchy we'll go over where they shake hands we'll go over where they don't ball and cry and beat on the Altar and cry out you want to be too human what we need is birth dying out that brings forth life praise God a seed an old potato a seed potato you take that potato and put it in the ground until you can have new potatoes that that old potato has to root a corn cannot produce new life until it's rotten amen and a man or a woman can never have new birth until their intellectuals and their own self is rotten dead amen down at the altar and scream get all messed up to a place of starch gets out of your collar and you're born again by the spirit of God hallah I don't care if you W speak in tongue jump up and down flop like a chicken with his head off you're bringing forth new life amen but we substituted something for it amen we want the classical way praise God sure the other day Friday wife and I was going to the store I don't mean to harp on this but as we went down the street I just kept turning my head one way for the other naked women I promise God when I was a blind man if he'd heal my eyes I'd look at the thing was right I keep a little cross hanging in my car when I see such as that I look at the cross and say oh God that's my refuge as I looked at the cross I've seen those women prise God me said we haven't seen one woman today that's got on a skirt and she said bill look at that woman there with those little straps around the top of her body said you mean to tell me that woman don't know that's wrong said if she doesn't know it's wrong then she's out of her right mind I said just a minute honey she is an American she does as the Americans do I said I was in Finland not long ago sweetheart and I questioned there to a man that set me down Dr Mion and and we were going to the the health bath What's called the Sund and they take you in and P pour hot water on water on hot rocks and it just sweats you then they make you jump in ice water and then back out then you take you into a room and there's nurses and there women who scrub them in and them naked send them back into the pool I wouldn't go in I said Dr Mion that's wrong he said all right then rever Brandon that's wrong then how about your American doctors that'll strip a woman naked and lay her on the table and examine every sex organ she's got God how about your nurses in the hospitals I said excuse me brother n Mion you're right what is it it's Customs when I was in Paris I could hardly believe it that the urals for both men and women were the same on I couldn't understand it that the restrooms was on the side of the street were both male and female I couldn't believe that when women went to the beach to go swimming a boy and his sweetheart they had no dressing rooms they just took all their clothes to the last garment then turned their backs and put on a little strap when swimming but it's so they pay no attention to it it's a custom of friend in Africa women and men young and old no clothes at all walking through the Prairies never know what a restroom was or things or never went out of each other's s but they don't know the difference they don't know the difference but it's customs of Nations but I said honey we are different we're from another Nation we are pilgrims and strangers here that's what makes these things look so wrong amen for the Bible said they that profess such cleanly show that they are pilgrims and strangers there seeking a city to come amen a man or a woman in Italy in France in Africa in any other Nation that's ever Bor again of the Holy Ghost don't do those things amen they won't wear those clothes they won't act like that because they're of another nation whose ruler and maker is God we're from Heaven the spirit that's within you motivates your life if you are American you'll do as Americans do if you are French you'll do as the French do and criticize the other but if you are a god you'll do the way they do in heaven because your spirit comes from above and it controls you a little something you might look at in the scripture those who sought this new city acted different they professed that they were pilgrims and strangers but on the side of King they become fugitives and renegades but Christians were pilgrims and strangers a fugitive has no home a renegade is a horrible person but a pilgrim is something real and from a real land in another Nation trying to find his way home amen professing by his living that he has something that he's from another country there is the reason but yet those people who do so those people who wear those things let me tell you and South Africa when I saw 30,000 raw heathens naked blanket natives 16 18 20 year old girls boys with not once bch of clothes standing there with mud in their faces and painted Up Bones through their nose and blocks of wood hanging from their ears and cross human bones or some bones in their hair animals teeth hanging over them naked as they come into the world and didn't know it but when they received Christ and fell on their face and received the Holy Ghost they got up and folded their arms to hold shame to their bosom as they walked away and found clothes to put on Amen why they become pilgrims and strangers to this world amen hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah they were away from him yes sir oh yes these people call themselves Christians they belong to churches they go and say we are methodists we are Baptists we're Pentecostal we're s Day Adventist we're this that the other that doesn't have one thing to do with it your spirit the life that's in you motivates and tells what you are Jesus said by their fruit you shall know them the church has become like Israel first they seen all the Heathen Nations having a king God was their King and they seen the Heathen Nations having King so they wanted to act like the Heathen Nations and they bought themsel a king and as they did it they got in trouble gradually begin to come in gradually the world begin to slip into them finally ended up in aab one king coming just a little closer to it a little closer to it and finally squeeze the life out of them there they went and when their real king come they didn't know him that's the same thing the church has done it's adopted here they are it's adopted politics educations it's adopted organizations Society big churches amen High confuting preachers and when the real King comes they don't know him and they're crucifying the very Holy Ghost that's their King help us Jesus they don't know him Hallelujah but they laugh at him and make fun of him as they Jews did their Messiah the church is doing their Messiah the same way they don't know it they haven't got the spiritual Insight because they're so to to compare with the world we're exalted to Humble ourselves and one is a majority in God and today in the healing evangelist out on the fields there's such a competit competitors one says well bless God I have so many thousand I got a bigger meting than you have what difference does that make we have one or one million what difference does it make are we true to God are we true to his word do we stand under test of the holy spirit is it true that's the main thing but we compromise upon the Bible lot of our Pentecostal people upon the fundamental doctrines of this Bible compromise I don't want to hurt feelings I'm in my own church and I feel that I I could do just what in my church because I'm preaching the gospel but there's tens of thousands of Pentecostal preachers know that there's no such a thing in the Bible as a baptism in the name of father son Holy Ghost I challenge the Archbishop for anybody to show me where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost am but they compromise because these organizations has did so there's not one person in the New Testament and for 300 years afterwards the history of what was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen what is it organization that's did it compromising and today they' took all the street workers off the streets they've took the tambourine out of the church they've taken all the glory out of the church and got seminaries preaching little old rooster comb preaching all Polished in society and they're women wearing shorts and dresses that they're skinned into and man smoking cigarettes and gambling and telling dirty jokes it's a disgrace in the sight of God I know that's rough but it's time somebody said something compromising giving in acting like the world I don't care if I have to stand alone with nobody but God alone I'll preach the truth of God's Bible and stand for it if I die I'll still stand for the truth prise the Lord we want truth I measure up not according to the church but according to the word of God I want to measure up but Del did you notice she know that Samson had a power and she didn't know where that power laid she couldn't tell what that power was was but there was some great power that Samson possessed and she wanted to find it and as Delia she kept wooing Samson after her beauty oh she dressed herself real sexy and she walked before him and she teed like some of the little teenagers of the day and and so forth and just act like something other strip teas trying to woo Samson to her that's the same thing the world's done to to the church now where is your great power well if we'll organize that'll break the power the Catholic Church done it but the Philistines is on the Samson and a Luther come out and he organized again if you buy me with another card it'll hold me so they did and the fistings on me Samson what happened Wesley came out and broke the cards amen now you de see all along don't you know I love you Samson all right tell me the truth in your heart all right you buy me with another card all right now we'll do that what is that that's the denominational card you let me be free that I ain't got no denomination then I tell you you have me broke so how come the Pentecostals amen where's your power FL be up on me and he broke the cards again but now what happened is got the penny Pentecostals to Big doctors of divinity for their pastors some great man they've got just as much school in ritual as a Methodist or Baptist or the rest of them's got going into a church and you can't hear a amen just as cold as a bunch of uh Eskimos right off the North Pole amen cold indiff and now the Philistines is on these Samson the the Philistines is on the America where is that Oneness of spirit amen where is the Oneness of Pentecost Assemblies of God and the United and the Church of God and this that and the other each one with a different is and this one with that and this one with that we're so broke up the you can go into a city to hold a Revival of one Church sponsored the rest of them only even attend am the Communist is up on the America where is our power where is our Glory why is it because we went after the wisdom of man instead of the power of God why we got art preachers and things are so stiff and starchy till they've organized us that we're so starchy and stiff neck the people you never hear a shout in the church anymore you never hear anybody cry the MERS bch is put in the basement there's no more glory in the church all we do is set back this as stiff as we can be we're not free we're bound the devil with his modernistic demons has bound the Church of the Living God that's right there's no more power in the church there's no more freedom the people so starchy and stiff while the God can come into the midst of Pentecostal people and show that he's God and prove the signs of his resurrection that don't even shake them why a disgrace I walk across the country God working performing signs and people setting well I guess that's all right oh I know it can be done it doesn't move them why they're bound with delight of the world they're ineds now even got him into bound him into a confederation the Philistines are on these Samson what you going to do about them oh we've got great denomination sure we have greater membership than we ever had but where's the spirit where's the Holy Ghost that's what the devil has done it's wooed into the church it's kept wooing the church come to me I'll give you a great big Tabernacle over here if you'll just do this if you'll get rid of that fanatic preacher you got and get a man with Doctor divinities got some sense we'll build nice big classical Church would be like the rest of them shame on you Amen brother have a man that didn't know uh split coffee from beans but was filled with the Holy Ghost that was uncompromised by the power of God but it's got us so starching that some poor Saint can break through in the meeting and speak in tongues or shout a little bit or do something and the rest of them will all Gander around and look what was that well wonder why that must be a fanatic dropped in somewhere yes amen thank God you know that's the truth amen some poor Saint step in get happy enough to raise their hands and cry and praise the Lord somebody who will holler Amen to the preaching of the gospel and the rest of them turn around and see what he said that's Pentecostal what's a matter of your pattern after the Methodist after the Baptist they pattern after the Catholic Catholic pattern after hell and they're all together all after hell right theia has woo you into big churches find educated ministers take the better class well you know so and so down here's a millionaire if we could just get him to come into our congregation oh my if he isn't born again then he doesn't deserve to be there amen I don't care if he's got a million dollars if he owns 40 Cadillacs whatever he's got he's got to be borned again come right down to a new birth and be regenerated by the Holy Ghost and come out of there in a new birth snotting excuse me of crying and screaming and carry all like the rest of them and live a life afterwards to prove he's got it amen hallelujah that's what you need Samson the Philistines is up on Thee the Communist is up on Thee the world's up on Thee the devil's up on the they go back and they see the spirit of God perform Miracles and do things of his resurrection what Jesus Promised they say you know I think brother br's got a lot of mental telepathy my pastor said it was of the devil you poor hypocritical deluded Infidel all polished up you wolf and sheep's clothes Jesus said if You' have know me You' have know my day but you got a bunch of STS to try to make you like the rest of the world we want a bunch of man of God who don't compromise on the word but preach the truth and stand on the baptism of the Holy Spirit but what has the world done it shaved all your power off you were born Nazarite Pentecost but the world certainly shaved your power now to the starches the rest of them what are we going to do what's going to happen there's one glorious thing that I can think of in this text while Samson was bound we can't have a Revival listen our loyal brother Billy Graham reviv in our day listen oral Robert scream reviv in our day listen at the rest of them Reviving our they how can we have a Revival when we're bound amen we bound the holy spirit with our organizations and traditions and we can't have a holy ghost Revival man I know that's scorching hot with the weather but it's the truth how can we have a holy ghost Revival when you're so bound and starchy Farm of godliness the Bible said they had Farm of godliness but would deny the power there the power of what amen the power of the organization the power of the world the power of the church the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers and big buildings and finery and instead of the oldfashioned Holy Ghost it better be in a mission again amen how you going to have Revival of the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bound it and afraid of it there's where the trouble Li the Philistines is on the but the one blessed hope we have while Samson was in jail what's the first thing they had done when they caught him they bound him first they took his power away they found his secret they found your secret the world found your secret now you women all Bob your hair go like the world you man all go and act like the world it's all right tell jokes and dirty jokes and go out and smoke a few cigarettes and run out with the neighbors wives and everything else like that a little sociable drink to hold your job I'd rather lay on my belly and eat sod crackers and drink Branch water and stay clean and pure before God then the compromise for any kind of a job right thank you true stay true to God Samson the Philistines is on thee brandom Tabernacle whism is creeping in among you what about it have you exposed your secret have you exposed that secret did God give you when you were Walling there and ass sawdust a few years ago have you let it creep out the social formal worship God what's happened to you God can come down and perform a miracle and go right down to the the audience and tell people the secrets of their hearts and everything and heal the sick and Afflicted and do signs and wonders and preach his word as hard as it can by the Holy Ghost and people say well I guess that's all right we enjoy listening to it once in a while if we're not too tired that's brandom Tabernacle the Philistines is on the what used to be when the preaching of the word and the old Saints with the tears in their eyes would rise to their feet and walk soling maybe not saying a word just walking around two or three times and sit down so filled with the Holy Ghost the word fedom amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Philistines is on the brandom Tabernacle Philistines is on you Pentecostal of course the Philistines got you rest of you long time ago when you organize yourself so time nothing can come unless you was a presbyterian Baptist Methodist Catholic or something you wouldn't have nothing do with the rest of them so reviv in our day how can we have it when the regular revor Giver is Bound By The World God won't come in where the world is you can just depend on that you associate with the world then it's it's all of it when you let the world creep in you go to act and act the world then you are finished but when you'll cut loose every feed from the world and come to God God will use you until you go to flirting again here's the only hope that I have this morning to wind up my message is this while Samson was bound a new shock of hair growed out God send us another church just before the end time that the power of the Holy Ghost can come into her in the demonstrations of the spirit and Mark 16 can follow the church Acts 2 and 4 acts 23 38 all of it will be following right along with the church signs and wonders accompan the apostles great signs of his resurrection accompany him while we're in prison surely God's growing a crop somewhere for the last great kill amen may it be you my Christian friend here this morning may it be your strength has begin to grow I pray that this message this morning and out into the land of where this will go I trust that this message will help bring the vitamin to your system that'll grow a spiritual power back into your life again Amen Let Us bow our heads and pray amen the power God back in his church man how did we lose it by flirting with the World by going away from the word how do we get it back to New Birth to be born again of the

was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me our gracious Heavenly Father this evening as our calendar year passes from one

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] know MO [Music] [Music] Lord [Music] [Music] Z [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen man I you enjoying it amen man there was a sister Alicia who had a testimony I'm not sure if she's in the building I can speak well English um I need help I is that okay I don't know how to sing very well but like many of you I have many testimonies it would be a lot to go very far back in my life but not so long ago in a preaching um uh in my own home I was asking for a topic that I had in my heart [Music] um and I didn't think that it would be spoken about so soon here and our pastor was speaking of said topic and as soon as he started speaking it caught my attention because just a few weeks ago I had been thinking about that topic and I don't know if it's happened to you guys that when the Lord is speaking to you it's like I could see back and not see any of you guys standing there it's as if I was alone as if it was all for me and almost literally I looked all around me and I practically saw no one and during the whole preaching I was very excited about that topic and when he did the calling to the altar I was still doubting in either going up or not because I felt that I had gotten everything there I was just giving thanks to God for speaking to me so quickly and in the last prayer that he did for everybody I just raised my hand and said Lord thank you because I am understanding everything that you're speaking but in a moment I also wanted to go up and to be prayed for and I was uh practicing what I was going to tell him to say to pray for me me and I was sure that I wasn't going to be able to say it but she's always uh thinking about me and in a moment she was already with me well she translated for me and in that moment I felt the presence a lot I couldn't even uh take a look at him as something started happening in me that I wanted to take aby's hand because I couldn't look at him or look anywhere I just closed my eyes and I don't know what moment I felt that I uh took his arm but I don't know if he can remember but I felt that I took a hold of him and in that moment I heard that he was speaking to me in Spanish I was understanding everything he was saying and if Abby was telling me something I couldn't hear her anymore it was too much of what I was feeling because because I know it was the Lord through these vases that he's used in these preachers I think every preacher and all the time that they use to speak to us I'm a person that's a little nervous and I never like to come up here but I'm but I'm really thankful for the time that y'all use to speak to us because I notic that sometimes they have to set aside their to put the things of God and I'm very thankful because God has given me 365 days healthy safe and the only thing I have to do is come here and sit down and sometimes I what will I tell the Lord when they've prepared so much and that I can't live the word I do the best I can pray for us it looks like we're alone but we're not alone brother we have him on our side and I have loved you guys very much the very little amount of we to talk y'all are very sweet with me and with Abby and I would like to say a lot of things but I want to give time to everybody else to the Musicians as well because y'all take the time to the precious voices that are sometimes behind even little girls and I sometimes just close my eyes and I feel like my voice is coming out in them to me it's just an inspiration and hear their beautiful voices to me they're very brave to come up here and give a song special y are very brave and all the work that y'all their moms do to teach them and Sunday school teachers for the patience they have I lived it once with her and I had to have a lot of patience and I don't want to leave without saying that I don't remember if that day that I had that blessing with the Lord it was a Sunday I don't remember if it was the next Monday or two Mondays after I got to my job and the lady in the house told me that she would just come back in a little moment but to me it was all normal because she does that a lot and when she came back she came back very happy and I when I passed by her she stopped me and told me Alicia how is your case I have a case with a lawyer and well since I've known her for years she's known a little bit about my case and I told her well it's going along it's just going along very slowly she said okay just be more sincere with me and I told her that um well right now it's a little detained it's going along but it's a little detained because I'm doing it in payments but I know that there the Lord is just waiting for me to get all the money together so she sat me down she took away what I had what what I was holding in my hands and she told me we want to take your case well I didn't understand it because I know they're not lawyers but they paid the full price so it's just pure grace that the Lord has given me to be walk here I have a lot to be thankful for and maybe I have so little to give but I want to live this year the best that I can love and keep walking in that Grace together with my children I ask for your prayers for my uh son my older son I only have two children and maybe I haven't done my best with them but I ask for your prayers I need to each and every one of you being my sisters and brothers and my family God bless you [Applause] knows how to reach each one of his children amen amen man let's sing that song listen to our hearts key of D amen how do you explain oh and how do you this cry oh and a love that goes from to and runs as deep it is oh and it all [Music] our oh and Lord all I Fe oh and the words cannot express the love we feel but we long for you to hear so listen to our [Music] heart

we know oh and to tell you what an aome God you [Music] are to our heart hallelu Amen brother jel Villa has a testimony after that uh the mubanga family I believe they have a song Amen mangas really amen God bless you [Music] before I begin I want to thank God for one more year of uh uh life alongside my wife 27 years now 33 33 years I'm sorry in the 27th of [Applause] December was I want to be short because if I say we be all night in 2023 the Lord sent me an angel when we began to rent uh the home that we're renting we prayed to the Lord so that maybe he would change the heart of the landlord to sell us their home [Music] and in November he said I have good news I'm going to sell you the home but I didn't have the credit uh to buy the home because I had to go through the bank all of November and December January February March when and I would go hunting I would go out there on my own and I would cry alone out there uh but I prayed to him and I prayed for him to send me an angel so that I can buy my home and he responded he sent me an angel and he said and he said brother um go buy the house uh that you want I'm going to buy it for you but I asked the Lord that if I things would turn out wrong and I couldn't pay it that not to do it uh to Hur my brother and the enemy just put up uh stipulation after stipulation and we couldn't do anything and that was one that was one Angel yes and this year you sent another Angel my wife and I we were thinking of uh preparing our documents but it was too expensive and I asked the Lord once again Send Me an Angel again so that he can help me and he sent him again and the brother said he said here you go so that you can start your case and we started the case they said in seven to eight months they would get the uh their social security and then after that they would get the the per the permit the permit to work and I want to thank God because he always responds he's always there he always responds for all the needs that we have and like my sister Alicia said things have happened to me when when I hear a sermon in English and then all of a sudden it's in English and I realized that I'm understanding like if it was in Spanish and this year uh when I was sad the first time in a brother Billy uh year it was like it was for me he said I'll be with you and all the scripture was for me everything that they that he R says if the Lord was speaking to me you're not alone oh I'm not going to leave you alone I want to thank all of you all of you we love you everyone the we're so happy to be here and be part of this congregation God bless you all and help you God bless Lord bless you guys uh I want to say Happy New Year's from the Wanga St house uh we bring also greetings to you from St Marcos small

Lord tell you Jesus Jesus Is My Rock my rock sword and Shi oh Jesus Is My Rock my rock my sword and [Music] shield it's my rock and my shield amen one that you can depend on Amen and so we invite the ministers to just come and say a few words I know they were hoping they can get away with it but uh we'll have Brother David Jr and then after that brother Andrew and and then we'll have brother Ben come after that amen God bless you Saints I truly can say that there's no place I'd rather be than just uh gather to together with those who you know we we really have had our hearts turned by an end time message and we've gathered around a truth and and uh you know this is you're standing before the evidence of of what the restored word is I the bride and and the testimony you're seeing that you know God's desire to have a body a bride and a church and know each testimony that the Holy Spirit the same yesterday today and forever having people hear in their own language the true book of Acts is being lived out and uh you know we're just thankful to be a part of it I I believe around this time a year ago we were uh we honestly thought that we were terminally ill and just seeing the Lord un undertake miraculously for us the things that the men medicine and the symptoms were testifying to the Lord just supernaturally delivered us and healed us and we're standing here just to uh by his grace and his love and you know and one of the things I reflect back on just looking at this year you know I'm I'm thankful for a pastor that uh just yields himself to the Lord and and you know I don't think we would truly understand all the things that a Shepherd is able to Shield the flock from um the wounds and the things that he are probably suffered and you know it's uh just a something I want to recognize and say thank you for all you do for everything you've done through the past year the building the church the the many labors and you know I I I look back at this year and I I'm just grateful for everybody especially our pastor and I just um want to say thank you Lord for all you all that he's done God bless you God bless you all you know it's little thought that I had uh the Lord's dealing with me about the new year and I just believe even after tonight's uh message about Samson the little thought was just have the right vision and a lot of times just like Samson he got his eyes on things that were pleasant to the eye but you know I I believe that if we would see like what is Promised just even in the tape that there's coming a Revival and it's an individual and so for me personally what I want to have my eyes on is to do like I believe it was Ruth that when it was barley season it was a time of a harvest there's a time of harvest you know there's a time where you and I have received this message message and just like our brother was saying our hearts have been turned and so I want to be faithful like Ruth and go out and you know collect the little wheat that's dropping off here and there and how do we do that by going and feeding and praying and receiving that word into a heart and then it actually what it did for Ruth is so striking to me but there was somebody there a prince that fell in love with her and her character her faithfulness and that's what I want to be I want to have the vision that I'm not looking at the things of the world the Technologies though they have great iPhones and they have great cars and different Technologies but I don't want to be like Samson where the enemy blinds me I want to have the right Vision I want to be faithful to go into the word of God and I want to do my part you know we see there's older saints of God like our brother David was our brother you know was telling about our pastor you know we make a way one for the other when God strikes you with Revelation it moves you into action and we go and bear for one another and we thank God for a Godly Pastor one that sees and has Vision I remember and I was going to testify of this before but before this was even built this was back in 2015 or or 14 but we were out here and there was a number of us and it was when um brother Ed bisc was here and a number of us was walking in this property and we were looking up at the tower and brother Ed bisc turned around and spoke about Brother David having being a a vision and I believe that God gives a man a vision that he can blaze a trail that others can follow and say this is the way and that's what our Prophet did and I believe that he's an example of faithfulness to hold to the word of God and I want to take courage and I want to say I want to have the right Vision I want to see the people that have gone before us and follow in their steps that's what we're to be to other people amen so I want to unite my heart I want to be like like this there was a quote in there it says one is the majority with God this is a time to unite become one with God and we become the majority it's not worrying about the world and things so I just want to have the right Vision I want to be faithful I want to go into the storehouse I want God to feed me so that whenever I go and I've been feeding on a tape and I come in contact with somebody who has a need I already have the word in season and it can bring life to somebody that's what the seed will do it'll bring life we've received life now it's time to go and be about our father's business amen God bless you we love you you know it's really the love of God that brings confidence that's what it's a byproduct of the love of God is revelation so we can not have to dwell and worry about our Humanity we can look and see there's something on the inside that's greater than my Humanity it's the love of God let it shine this year God bless you [Applause] wow that was good that was amazing um so driving here you kind of learned uh especially when it comes to Brother David that um you have to be ready for the unexpected you there's never anything that's normal that you can can expect there's always going to be something you don't understand but it's always good but as I was coming here I was pondering um a song was playing in my head and I I love the sing so when a song strikes me sometimes that's where I find my inspiration I was thinking of the song in his time right and every year that goes by we make plans we make decisions of things we want to get done in a year we say well this is my target this is what I want to hit this year if I don't hit it then this year is a failure and I got to thinking on that I was like man where was I last year compared to this year and you start looking you start comparing and saying well I failed here I failed there I failed here and I failed there like wow this year was a waste but it can't be a waste I'm righteous he orders my steps everything that goes on within this year he knew it would take place I'm not one step behind I'm no further than what he knew I would be in this moment so if you've got a need and desire for something if it's a loved one if it's a desired outcome of a life you want to live whatever it is whatever vision is you have in your mind understand the Lord's timing is everything right he's he's The Giver of all good gifts so whether he gives it to you or not your your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life you've got something to be happy about so that song in his time was really on my heart so I we'll just sing that chorus cuz why not in his [Music] time in his time [Music] he makes all things beautiful in [Music] his oh and Lord please show me every day as you're teaching me your way that you'll do just what you say in your time one of the best advice I'd say brother David's ever given me and it sticks to me constantly he says buddy you could pray and pray and fast and do all of these things but God can do no more for you than what he set out to do so just rest and knowing he's in control in this year God bless you Saints amen oh there's a g sorry oh there's a country far beyond the S oh and there the city where the name ever comes a night oh and if we faithful wish I go the by and by oh and the city

amen amen you know I uh I appreciate all the nice things people say but you know uh I I really want everyone to know you you know Billy is really a great big help to me and uh I I always just appreciate him and and so you know he always tries to sit in the back and get out of the way but I want him to say a couple things too so Ben want said you got to be ready for the unexpected that's just this I never know what I'm doing so uh I just take it as it comes so so anyway Billy say a word catch yeah amen the Lord has been good amen you know there's so much to say and and I I really don't want to take up any time and just you know I remember earlier this year I went to see a doctor and you know you know how you go see a doctor the verdict is usually you're going to die you know so it's never anything good that comes out of it but uh you know I thank God that you know and he he touched my body he heals me and and I feel a lot better and and I purpose in my heart for any for all that is done for me am man I'll spend my life serving him amen you know when the Lord does something good to you you do something back you want to show your appreciation for all that he does for you amen and you know I know uh things has been said about Brother David is just I the the leadership is just unmatched um he uh you you learn so much by just watching him and the way he does things and and to a leader is not one who stands in the front and bid his chest and want people to follow him a leader is a leader by example it's one that uh usually when when everything is going fine you won't even see him he is high he somewhere just want to see how everything evolve and and when there's something to be corrected he just knows how to slip in there and just starts to work and and correct it and I and I and I've just I I'll say it's just been an opportunity of a lifetime to just uh you know work alongside him and just watch him and and learn from him and see how he does things and just wonder why and ask the question and it will answer you and show you so you you don't do things because it's just the way to do it but you understand the motive and objective behind and I've been so fortunate to have that uh and I could say it's a true friend I've had an opportunity to just uh stay close to him and just listen and and watch him and be able to learn a lot and I thank God for that amen and my heart desire for the New Year I'll say like the prophet it's not we don't change P turn pages and I we don't as Believers but mam said that the believer has to be the most motivated person that is on the face of the Earth and and our goals has not changed Rapture is the goal and often time the devil will try to throw things in there to try to cause you to look the other way and that's what he does every day but my if but says that if we could just keep our eyes straight to the Cross we're not turning a new leave what we wanting for every day of our life is to make contact with Christ is to be born again is to continually die to ourselves and let him Live This Promise this message is a promise of a Rapture this message has a promise of an overcomer and it's not an overcomer for one day it's the Overcomer from here till eternity but R said when God gave his weapon his weapon was good for everything I want in my life to be able to utilize the weapon not just for my own circumstance but every time I come against even one that's tied up and bind up in the de and the devil has gotten so twisted up that I be able to use the weapon and and make it effective and make sure that weapon works not just for me but for others that's the desire of my heart to be where God wants me to do to be and doing what he wants me to be doing amen God bless [Applause] you you know the it really doesn't do do much good to look back because there's not a thing you can do about it you know what I mean you can learn from it but if you don't have a path forward you're going to repeat the same mistakes over and over again and so I'd like to share with you what my vision is for our body and what it is that my heart desires to see and I I think it so beautifully put if I was to use some scriptures in Ephesians the 4th chapter and I'd just like to read uh uh maybe the first seven verses and and this is Paul speaking he said I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called and I like that because Paul puts every single one of us as part of it that we've all been called and we all have a vocation a vocation a work something that that fits the characteristics and the gifts that God's given us a vocations he said like a calling that that called calls you and he goes on to speak that we walk worthy of that that we realize that when when we let our flesh get in the way we're not walking worthy of the calling and we want to be Overcomers and and do better and then he goes on to say with all lowliness and meekness and longsuffering forbearing one another in love and again it he's talking about this Unity that the body of Believers have that each one of us is upholding the truth of the Gospel that we might Adorn the doctrines of God and then he says endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace endeavoring to keep the unity of of the spirit in the bond of Peace see as he's speaking here he's not leaving anybody out there there's not smart there's not foolish there's not better there's not ver we're all in it together and he goes on he says this he says there is one body there's one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all and you know I was fellowshipping the other morning with brother Mike Parks Junior and brother Jonathan and we got talking about the Oneness of the body when a body of Believers can come in one Mind One Faith one Spirit have one goal the same absolute and that what we could be as a United one body One Voice you say well I have this job I speak that language how many different languages did we hear s singing why I I sat and the world doesn't know what they're missing the the voices the the talent the songs uh you know I mean I was just sitting back you know I think this side of my mouth touched this ear and this guy I mean I just couldn't believe my eyes I thought where's all these people been hiding you know and and we want to step forward you know what I mean and and and and and realize every day that we represent the message of the hour and God has identified himself with us by giving us the privilege to say that we are the bride and doesn't matter where we came from because there's one faith one baptism one word one message one truth and if we could come into that wholeness and and you've got to know you're a part of it if you don't say you're a part of the body then you're not but if if we would all go all in for this gospel if we would go all in to sharing ing this message if we would go all in to have our candles burn bright if all of us would agree to that one thing you know I I thought of uh brother Manasses and and sister zier you know uh he he's he represents our country he's a soldier and and I I appreciate your service and and your duty and and what you do I respect that I respect and I want to respect whatever station or place that a person is that there's no Envy there's no jealousies there's no no no despising one another but if we could become this one the prophet of God said that's what brings the rapture is when we come into that great union doesn't hurt to die to yourself he's got you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand so we just just in and I I want our our what we want to go into the storehouse and bring out if the Holy Spirit would help us is the things that bring us to that Unity that our lights could shine and our good works could glorify Our Father in Heaven that each believer in this building would have the confidence to testify of the word of God to lay your hands on the sick to pray for others and that the works of God would not be in this place but they would be manifested that we will not light our candle and put it under a bush basket but that we'll let our light so shine that our good works might glorify Our Father in heaven and let me tell you no matter how smart they are someone was telling me the other day how smart Elon Musk was oh he's a genius he's really smart I said Elon Musk is stupid he's bone head stupid he wants to try to go to Mars why waste billions of dollars in Mars when you can go so fast past Mars so far out of this universe for free don't give me that light you know he wants to create batteries and all this that produces light well I got something This Little Light of Mine you know I mean it'll shine in darkness you know what I mean and and then what does it profit the whole man if he can gain the whole world and lose his soul he ain't smart if he was smart he would find the closet somewhere find an altar and then he would sell all that he had and give it to the poor and come follow him don't forget what smart really is the wisdom of God is foolishness to man and the wisdom of man is foolishness to God so don't forget who you are and what you're a part of and and that God created us us to be a body fitted and joined together so and that's what my heart's desire is is that we can all come into this Oneness and that the Holy Spirit would go into the storehouse of God's word the word that God left us by and he left it to us himself people say brother brandom left it to us no Jesus left it to us himself he the Lord Jesus came veiled himself that's right and hid himself in a vessel as as as he said a veil a human flesh Veil and broke the Mysteries to us stored up the word of God for us that all of us could Feast so there's no reason for any of us to go hungry and there's every reason for us to look out after one another so let's become one lot of churches lot of places all over the world and we we we wish every single one of them well that they prosper and that they be in good health but what I'm concerned about is is as for me and my house we'll serve the Lord and for as far as our body's concerned we will stay with the word we will stay with the message we will look for into the storehouse to have the things that make us more Christlike and so I just trust that that this coming year that that you would make a greater effort to be a part of the local body that you wouldd make a greater effort to contribute not financially but spiritually by coming in service prepared worshiping letting the your light shine that you would become more involved in the body by praying one for another and looking out after one another another that you would come to such a place that you would say this is my family this is my people amen this is who I'm going to spend eternity with and I want to serve and love one another because you'll know that you are my disciples by your love for one another and our dedication to the word of God I'm not ashamed of this message cuz it's the power of God un salvation and I just trust that we can all come into that where we're all giving of ourselves one to another we live right for one another we do right for one another we pray for one another without ceasing and I pray with all my heart that our body will grow that we'll have new children not in the natural only but spiritually that will have new parts and new growth and that other people can come to enjoy the good things of God and once again I just say I just so amazed at the worship and the song specials tonight and everybody and Joseph was so nice to have you on the piano again I hope to see you there more often I think I'll get some superglue or something have you stick around a while anyway so we love you all very much let's stand together let's bow our heads and and let us all pray together you each in your own way each of you pray in your heart as we take a moment to dedicate our selves and our commitment and our r renewal of our faithfulness and Fidelity to our master and to our Lord and to the word that he's given us to keep let us pray everybody pray in your own heart our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just lift our voices to you and we pray in our hearts and we trust father that you hear us as we pray father we want to be ever true to your word we want to be ever father in service father we want to keep you on our hearts and our minds father we ask you to forgive us of the things that we've done that are so unlike you and father may we perfect the love that you have for us that father it could

could look and wonder what is the Hope what is the joy that you possess and father may they know that we are your disciples and that they could say of us they have been with Jesus we ask these things in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen well you all been up past midnight so uh let trust the Lord take a a good rest tomorrow I hope none of you have to work and and we just pray that
