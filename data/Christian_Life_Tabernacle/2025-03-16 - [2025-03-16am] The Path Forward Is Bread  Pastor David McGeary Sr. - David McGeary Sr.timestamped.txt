[53:12] ones this morning uh we help you and I
[53:15] know that uh we're all here for the
[53:18] glory of the Lord so let's read our
[53:22] scripture and then we're going to read a
[53:24] lot of scripture and and we're going to
[53:27] try to just bring something that's on
[53:29] our heart this morning and it says in
[53:33] and you know the story this is the uh uh
[53:37] as the four verse starts then was Jesus
[53:40] led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness
[53:45] to be tempted of the
[53:48] devil and when he had fasted 40 days and
[53:53] 40 nights he was afterward and hung
[53:56] hungry and when the tempter came to him
[54:01] he said if thou be the Son of God
[54:07] command that these Stones be made
[54:13] bread and Jesus answered and said it is
[54:18] written man shall not live by bread
[54:21] alone but by every word that proceeded
[54:26] out of the mouth of God God bless you
[54:29] may be seated this
[54:39] morning uh if I was to title my sermon
[54:43] this morning I would call it the path
[54:46] forward is
[54:48] bread
[54:50] and uh we're going to be uh sharing some
[54:54] thoughts with you this morning out of
[54:57] the message Harvest time and what
[55:00] brought me to this is I was thinking on
[55:04] the tape I sat Saturday morning and I
[55:07] listened to uh the sermon
[55:12] recognizing its day and its
[55:16] message and and I I I plac that in my
[55:19] heart because there's so many voices and
[55:24] so much political
[55:26] disturbance and uh people are uh moving
[55:32] out of our country because they can't
[55:34] stand the current president and and
[55:38] they're starting to find out all kinds
[55:41] of things that are government's been
[55:43] doing and they're all in a total
[55:47] uproar
[55:48] um and uh so I I told lesie this morning
[55:53] I said I I I'm I I I just read an
[55:57] article that if you drink water out of a
[56:00] plastic bottle it's uh it's going to
[56:03] hurt you so I said no more no more micro
[56:07] Plastics and and uh all all these things
[56:10] that make America healthy again and uh
[56:15] uh you know all this is killing you all
[56:17] this is killing you so they've come to
[56:20] the
[56:22] realization that everything's killing
[56:24] them if they would listened to a prophet
[56:27] 5050 years
[56:29] ago they would have already known these
[56:33] things and I thought one of the things
[56:36] that was brought out that was so
[56:40] tremendous and and I want to shed light
[56:43] on this if I could in a way that uh um
[56:48] you can understand why that they're in
[56:51] the condition that they're in you
[56:55] understand I me one side just can't
[56:58] believe it but they discovered that our
[57:01] government had spent $20
[57:06] million of studying if men could have
[57:12] babies
[57:13] now on the surface that might appear to
[57:17] you to be a
[57:21] shock men in women's sports and trans
[57:26] gender and uh uh gender affirming and
[57:32] all these things about gender and all
[57:35] these things about uh men and women and
[57:41] E and this coming together and and I was
[57:46] visiting with some of the brothers and
[57:47] it struck me you know that Satan is a
[57:53] perverter we know that and what what his
[57:57] goal was is to exalt himself above the
[58:01] sons of God and to be worshiped as God
[58:06] now if I could give uh a little bit of
[58:12] logic or make a little sense of their
[58:17] thinking kind of if I could say this in
[58:20] their defense of why that they're
[58:24] pursuing so something that seemed so
[58:28] incredibly odd to
[58:32] us that about uh men becoming women and
[58:38] women becoming men and them wanting to
[58:41] do away with the the pronouns and and
[58:47] identifying everything that the way that
[58:52] they want to identify things but if you
[58:54] would go back to to the
[58:57] beginning and you would begin to
[59:00] understand when God made man man was
[59:03] both male and
[59:07] female you understand that he was both
[59:11] male and
[59:12] female now if you take God out of the
[59:16] picture and that's what man had done
[59:20] they they believe that man
[59:23] evolved whether it was something
[59:27] bumping into somebody in space or but
[59:30] eventually they said that man evolved up
[59:34] from uh a primate uh some might say a a
[59:39] monkey or an ape or chimpan or and and
[59:44] they've done studies how smart they are
[59:46] and and and all all these things you
[59:49] know and uh uh and so they they have
[59:53] this they have this uh
[59:57] this idea in them that man evolved
[1:00:00] because they've eliminated God from
[1:00:04] their thinking now I know that's hard
[1:00:06] for you to do but they don't believe in
[1:00:08] a god therefore they don't believe in an
[1:00:12] end they don't believe in a judgment
[1:00:15] they don't believe they have to answer
[1:00:17] to anything alls that they do is they
[1:00:21] believe that they're
[1:00:24] evolving and and and so all of this
[1:00:28] thinking that's going on is they believe
[1:00:32] that man is going to
[1:00:35] evolve back in have you ever seen
[1:00:37] pictures of what they show what a man a
[1:00:41] thousand years from now is you know he's
[1:00:44] got a great big head because he's full I
[1:00:47] think they're kind of bigheaded already
[1:00:49] but you know they got a great big head
[1:00:52] you know what I mean and and they're all
[1:00:55] creatur listic and everything they
[1:00:57] believe that man's
[1:00:59] evolving that way he he's he's going to
[1:01:03] evolve into a being where he's back to
[1:01:07] being male and female where he's back to
[1:01:10] being able to reproduce within
[1:01:14] himself and so this is the kind of
[1:01:17] thinking that man's given over to and he
[1:01:21] has a reprobate
[1:01:24] mind because they've taken God out of
[1:01:27] the
[1:01:28] picture and they've taken the word of
[1:01:31] God out of the picture so this is why
[1:01:35] they're studying all these things they
[1:01:37] believe that man's going to go to Mars
[1:01:39] they believe that man's going to evolve
[1:01:41] man's going to become smarter he's going
[1:01:44] to interact with artificial intelligence
[1:01:48] and and he's going to become something
[1:01:51] that is both male and
[1:01:54] female well it's just they can't come up
[1:01:58] with anything new Under the
[1:02:00] Sun God made them male and
[1:02:04] female they were together and God
[1:02:07] separated them so you just begin to see
[1:02:11] and you begin to
[1:02:14] recognize that this is all of sign of
[1:02:17] our
[1:02:19] time and that was a great failure that
[1:02:22] man has always came into if you would uh
[1:02:26] follow with me this morning is there
[1:02:29] inability to recognize the hour and the
[1:02:34] time that they're in and the message
[1:02:37] that God has for
[1:02:39] them so each of you this morning I I'm
[1:02:43] here with you we've got not only to
[1:02:47] recognize what's going on in in the
[1:02:52] world around us but we need to recognize
[1:02:55] what's going on in the spirit and in the
[1:02:59] life and and what what's going on within
[1:03:03] our own
[1:03:04] s uh and and and we we need to make a a
[1:03:10] a great
[1:03:12] connection with what that we live
[1:03:17] by you know what it is that we're living
[1:03:21] by and if if it's ever an hour
[1:03:26] uh that we realize the events of what
[1:03:31] has transpired and as Christians we know
[1:03:34] that the Lord taught us that his gospel
[1:03:37] would go into the
[1:03:40] ground we understand that unless a seed
[1:03:43] you know dieth and goeth into the ground
[1:03:47] it cannot bring forth life so he knew
[1:03:51] that the seed of his word what that he
[1:03:55] was preaching in was going to go into
[1:03:59] the ground he knew the enemy would come
[1:04:02] up and stand against us how many
[1:04:03] believes God knows all
[1:04:05] things so he knew that what he was
[1:04:09] preaching that the enemy wouldn't leave
[1:04:12] it
[1:04:13] alone he knew there would be four horse
[1:04:16] riders that would come out and would
[1:04:19] battle against it he knew that he that
[1:04:23] Satan would try to make the word of none
[1:04:26] effect so he knew that that word and
[1:04:30] that truth of the Gospel that he
[1:04:32] preached would one day be buried in the
[1:04:36] ground in in a Roman Catholic
[1:04:41] educational
[1:04:44] scientific uh uh
[1:04:47] civilization it would get buried but he
[1:04:50] knew it would rise
[1:04:52] again and we understand that because we
[1:04:56] want to recognize the day and its
[1:04:59] message and we saw that that what what
[1:05:03] Christianity was in the
[1:05:05] beginning you cannot look at what the
[1:05:09] disciples
[1:05:10] were and what the Life of Christ
[1:05:14] was and go to
[1:05:17] Rome and look at the Catholic church and
[1:05:21] say that they have any comparison
[1:05:26] whatsoever
[1:05:28] religious oh very
[1:05:31] religious spiritual oh very very uh
[1:05:37] reverent and holy and atmosphere of and
[1:05:43] esteem uh uh fabulous buildings and
[1:05:47] everything but that was so far away from
[1:05:51] one that didn't have a place to lay his
[1:05:54] head
[1:05:57] you you know what I mean that preached
[1:05:59] on the hillsides and and and and and and
[1:06:03] did signs and wonders and and did work
[1:06:06] so the the the you can't even relate
[1:06:10] them hardly one to another because we
[1:06:14] knew this seed would have to go into the
[1:06:16] ground and then we realized that that as
[1:06:20] that seed came up it sprung up one day a
[1:06:26] a
[1:06:27] priest got to reading
[1:06:29] Romans and he
[1:06:32] realized that there was one sacrifice
[1:06:35] for
[1:06:37] sin and that was the blood of the lamb
[1:06:41] and that Jesus Christ cleansed us from
[1:06:44] all sin and
[1:06:46] unrighteousness that there was Power in
[1:06:49] the Blood there was power in forgiveness
[1:06:53] and that man was not justified by his
[1:06:57] Works he was justified only and solely
[1:07:01] by the blood of Jesus
[1:07:04] Christ and there was only one place that
[1:07:08] God would meet a man and that's under
[1:07:10] that shed blood so don't ever bring to
[1:07:14] God all that you've done and all that
[1:07:17] you think you are and and oh I've done
[1:07:20] this and I've done that you know when
[1:07:22] those two men were praying in the temple
[1:07:24] it was the guy in the back that said
[1:07:27] Maya Koopa have mercy on me have mercy
[1:07:30] on me I'm a sinner that's the one that
[1:07:32] God heard the one that knew he needed a
[1:07:36] sacrifice the one that he knew he needed
[1:07:39] a savior the one that knew he didn't
[1:07:41] have any righteousness and that our
[1:07:44] righteousness is his filthy rags but
[1:07:46] it's the righteousness of the
[1:07:49] father and that God did that for
[1:07:53] us and he saw
[1:07:56] that and he said no it's not it's not
[1:08:00] the
[1:08:01] literal body of Jesus it's not the blood
[1:08:04] it's not confessing sins it's not paying
[1:08:08] offerings it's not giving the priest
[1:08:10] your
[1:08:12] money it's not kneeling in s rosaries
[1:08:15] for hour and endless disputations and
[1:08:19] and the worship of
[1:08:21] saints what a Revival
[1:08:25] could you imagine being locked into that
[1:08:28] prison of the Catholic church and coming
[1:08:31] forth and realizing that that that you
[1:08:35] didn't have to go through that mother
[1:08:37] Harlot to make it that God had provided
[1:08:40] a way for you
[1:08:43] personally oh
[1:08:47] my and they they broke they they were
[1:08:50] they came out of
[1:08:52] it and the Protestant church was born
[1:08:57] Protestant was
[1:08:59] protester they protested those things
[1:09:02] they don't protest them
[1:09:04] anymore they just join right
[1:09:09] up and then Wesley came on the scene
[1:09:12] didn't
[1:09:14] he and he said wait a
[1:09:18] minute just because
[1:09:21] that we're
[1:09:23] forgiven doesn't mean that we can't live
[1:09:27] right and he began to preach the
[1:09:30] sanctification of the
[1:09:32] believer not the believer's sins are
[1:09:36] forgiven now that believer sanctifies
[1:09:39] himself sanctification means he sets
[1:09:43] himself aside for service I'm going to
[1:09:47] make my
[1:09:50] life that it's a life of service
[1:09:56] it it's not it it's not in fellowship
[1:10:01] with
[1:10:02] Darkness it can't how can two walk
[1:10:06] together unless they agree and Wesley be
[1:10:10] to preach the sanctification of the
[1:10:13] church they called a Methodist because
[1:10:15] they they had a method of
[1:10:18] sanctification of of reading and of
[1:10:21] praying and of works and and and and and
[1:10:27] addressing right and acting right and
[1:10:30] speaking right these became things that
[1:10:32] mattered to them and they begin to
[1:10:35] sanctify themselves and the early
[1:10:37] Methodist Church had the Holy Ghost they
[1:10:40] they called them shouters and and rolled
[1:10:43] and they praised God and and they they
[1:10:46] lived
[1:10:48] right and many people uh uh
[1:10:53] misunderstand the baptism of the Holy
[1:10:55] hly spirit because of restoration of
[1:10:58] gifts restoration of gifts was not the
[1:11:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism
[1:11:03] of the holy spirit is the nature of
[1:11:06] Jesus Christ coming into a Believer and
[1:11:09] the believer came to the place that they
[1:11:12] knew not only were they Justified not
[1:11:14] only were they Sanctified but they could
[1:11:17] do the same works that he did by his
[1:11:23] spirit and that the spirit of God could
[1:11:27] lead them and they could be led and the
[1:11:30] sons as many as called the sons of God
[1:11:33] are led by the spirit of God and and
[1:11:36] they moved into the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:39] Spirit they sought the outpouring of the
[1:11:41] spirit they sought what that those men
[1:11:44] experienced in the upper room being
[1:11:46] endued with power from on high not
[1:11:50] emotion not gift but a power that was
[1:11:54] Supernatural Christ in them the hope of
[1:11:59] glory and we watch that seed grow
[1:12:04] up and so as I listen to that and I
[1:12:07] thought of recognized the day in the
[1:12:09] message and pro of God talk man always
[1:12:11] fails to recognize where they're
[1:12:15] at and I thought Lord in my heart and
[1:12:19] and the spirit just moved on me and it
[1:12:22] just came so to my heart what where are
[1:12:26] we lord I want to recognize the day I
[1:12:29] want to recognize what its message is to
[1:12:33] me it's a call out so many times I say
[1:12:36] well I believe the
[1:12:40] message I been this message over 50
[1:12:42] years I'll tell you I don't think I know
[1:12:44] half of
[1:12:47] it we've been patting one another on the
[1:12:50] back and making accolades about our
[1:12:55] elves you know we're the true church
[1:12:57] we're the bride and and you know like I
[1:13:01] said sometimes we ought to name our
[1:13:03] churches we're right and everybody else
[1:13:05] is
[1:13:08] wrong and I I think
[1:13:11] that
[1:13:13] that you know I I don't want to miss it
[1:13:16] and I cried out my heart and I thought
[1:13:18] Lord where are
[1:13:20] we and he says well David this is
[1:13:23] Harvest Time
[1:13:26] it's harvest
[1:13:29] time I'm going through
[1:13:33] now and I'm
[1:13:36] identifying ex
[1:13:38] separating the wheat from the
[1:13:41] shock it it's a time that it it's a time
[1:13:46] that there's a I'm making the
[1:13:50] change that I promised I made a promise
[1:13:55] and now I'm here to keep that promise
[1:13:59] I'm going to call out an elect I'm going
[1:14:01] to separate the sheep from the
[1:14:04] goats I'm going to have a church without
[1:14:07] spot or
[1:14:10] wrinkle and and that the
[1:14:14] process he he's going to perform the
[1:14:18] process and so I I I be I as I went and
[1:14:23] read this and I I wanted to
[1:14:26] make it clear to you this
[1:14:31] morning where I
[1:14:34] stand not only as an
[1:14:37] individual but because
[1:14:40] you've placed me in this office or God
[1:14:44] has and you've so diligently and
[1:14:49] Faithfully have sat under the ministry
[1:14:52] for years but I think you ought to have
[1:14:55] a right to know what I
[1:14:58] believe and what I stand
[1:15:01] for just as as plain as day and I
[1:15:05] thought of the way
[1:15:10] forward and that came on to me real
[1:15:13] early in the year you remember when I
[1:15:15] first began to preach it I thought about
[1:15:18] the going forward I want to go
[1:15:21] forward and as I looked and I I I I
[1:15:24] wrote these notes I
[1:15:28] said uh and a lot of people thought or
[1:15:34] maybe there was a way forward you know
[1:15:37] the the placing of the gifts uh in the
[1:15:41] church and speaking in in tongues and
[1:15:45] giving words of knowledge and prophecy
[1:15:48] and dancing in the spirit and praising
[1:15:52] and worshiping uh uh with
[1:15:55] emotion and
[1:15:57] expression and and and that that was
[1:16:01] presented to the
[1:16:05] church that there was a a a a move of
[1:16:09] the spirit again that the spirit was
[1:16:13] moving and that Pentecost was being
[1:16:17] revived and and and I just have to be
[1:16:21] honest with you I I I don't feel feel
[1:16:26] that it's the way
[1:16:30] forward now if you
[1:16:33] feel that way and you feel that's the
[1:16:38] path to go down then and if that that
[1:16:43] you feel that's the way the church
[1:16:46] should go then then you should join
[1:16:49] yourself to
[1:16:53] that don't sit in opposition don't fight
[1:16:57] him but if you feel that the path of the
[1:17:01] church going forward is the spirit
[1:17:05] moving and prophesying and speaking
[1:17:08] words of knowledge and and giving
[1:17:12] tongues and interpretations of tongues
[1:17:14] and dancing and shouting and running
[1:17:17] over the church that's fine I'm not
[1:17:20] against any of those things let them be
[1:17:23] done decently
[1:17:25] and in order but it's still I don't
[1:17:30] feel it's the path
[1:17:34] forward and I can only travel the path
[1:17:38] that I feel is a path that goes
[1:17:45] forward and you have to
[1:17:48] choose what's your
[1:17:51] path forward
[1:17:56] I've heard a lot
[1:18:01] of uh seemingly if I could say it this
[1:18:06] way of
[1:18:10] movements like and teachings and things
[1:18:14] of you know like another coming of the
[1:18:18] Lord you know where Jesus comes in in in
[1:18:23] a bride coming or he now he's coming in
[1:18:27] the form of his bride and and uh like
[1:18:32] there was one there was what they called
[1:18:34] perusia which was there's in a different
[1:18:37] anointing than there's ever been before
[1:18:41] that it this is the path we should take
[1:18:44] this movement this thinking this
[1:18:46] teaching and endlessly explaining it
[1:18:51] over I didn't feel that explanations of
[1:18:55] and pursuing explains and thoughts and
[1:18:58] trying to teach and and get
[1:19:01] terminologies and all those different
[1:19:04] things I just don't feel that's the path
[1:19:11] forward I don't feel it's going to get
[1:19:14] us
[1:19:20] there I I've seen so many of them the
[1:19:26] Thunders good men morally good men and
[1:19:31] they went down those paths because they
[1:19:35] believed in their heart that they were
[1:19:37] paths forward and that that was going to
[1:19:41] create some sort of
[1:19:44] Revival in in the hearts of men and
[1:19:47] women and Believers that was going to
[1:19:49] make them different there's only one
[1:19:51] thing that'll make you different and
[1:19:53] that you must be born
[1:20:00] again and it brought me
[1:20:03] to
[1:20:05] where
[1:20:07] that I stand this
[1:20:10] morning and the message that I say the
[1:20:14] way
[1:20:16] forward
[1:20:18] is this
[1:20:21] word and it's the bread
[1:20:24] that we live
[1:20:27] by and if you will go with me this
[1:20:31] morning and let us read in the gospel of
[1:20:35] St
[1:20:45] John in the sixth chapter of the Gospel
[1:20:49] of St John
[1:20:56] Jesus said that
[1:20:59] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:21:03] every
[1:21:05] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:21:12] God and I'd like to start this morning
[1:21:15] just in our thought here this
[1:21:22] morning Jesus had just fed
[1:21:26] the 5,000 and the
[1:21:30] 3,000 and gathered up Loaves and
[1:21:35] Loaves
[1:21:37] and he turned and there was a great
[1:21:40] multitude that had followed him now all
[1:21:45] the scriptures and scriptural
[1:21:48] stories are are not given to us just to
[1:21:54] meditate on but they're given to us to
[1:21:59] reflect deeply in our own
[1:22:02] conscience to examine our own thinking
[1:22:07] and our Pursuits down
[1:22:11] life and Jesus said to him and and he
[1:22:15] said Jesus answered
[1:22:23] them Jesus answered them and said verily
[1:22:26] verily I say unto you you seek me not
[1:22:31] because you saw the
[1:22:33] Miracles but because you did eat of the
[1:22:38] Loaves and were
[1:22:42] filled just think of how their natural
[1:22:46] survival
[1:22:48] clouds their
[1:22:51] spirituality and so many times our
[1:22:54] natural natural burdens and our natural
[1:22:57] problems our health our
[1:23:00] finances our jobs and our rent that
[1:23:04] cloud our
[1:23:05] spirituality and we worry about things
[1:23:08] that we should never worry
[1:23:11] about and Jesus goes on to say he said
[1:23:16] labor not for the meat which
[1:23:20] perisheth but for the meat which in
[1:23:24] endureth unto everlasting
[1:23:28] life which the son of man shall give
[1:23:32] unto you for him hath God the Father
[1:23:41] sealed now listen to that because we are
[1:23:44] living in the day of the son of
[1:23:49] man then they said unto him what shall
[1:23:52] we do
[1:23:54] that we might work the works of God
[1:23:58] Jesus answered and said unto them this
[1:24:03] is the work of God that ye believe on
[1:24:09] him who he hath
[1:24:13] sent in every age every messenger that
[1:24:17] went out every Star that went out if you
[1:24:21] follow the church the Believers in every
[1:24:24] age have believed whom God
[1:24:27] sent so you say brother McGary what's
[1:24:31] the path forward the path forward is to
[1:24:34] believe whom God ha
[1:24:45] sent then they said therefore unto him
[1:24:49] what sign showest thou then that we may
[1:24:55] see and believe thee what Dost thou
[1:25:01] work the look at man God never built his
[1:25:05] church on Works he built it on divine
[1:25:12] revelation and if he if he built his
[1:25:16] church on divine revelation he'll
[1:25:20] vindicate his church by divine
[1:25:23] revelation
[1:25:26] you you are
[1:25:28] Vindicated by the Revelation that's
[1:25:31] manifested in
[1:25:40] you he
[1:25:45] said he and that we may see and believe
[1:25:50] what does thou
[1:25:52] work what is it
[1:25:54] by what power do you do this what is it
[1:25:58] that's working in you our fathers did
[1:26:01] eat Mana in the desert as it is written
[1:26:05] he gave them bread from Heaven to
[1:26:10] eat now look at where they're
[1:26:13] at and now here come some of the
[1:26:16] greatest scriptures for the
[1:26:18] Believers let us walk through them just
[1:26:21] for a moment we'll try to hurry then
[1:26:24] Jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[1:26:28] unto you Moses gave you not that bread
[1:26:33] from heaven but my father giveth you the
[1:26:37] true bread from
[1:26:41] heaven for the bread of God is he which
[1:26:47] cometh down from heaven and gives life
[1:26:51] unto the world
[1:26:55] then said they unto him Lord Evermore
[1:26:58] give us this
[1:27:01] bread and Jesus said unto them I am the
[1:27:05] bread of
[1:27:07] life he that cometh to me shall never
[1:27:13] hunger and he that believeth on me shall
[1:27:18] never
[1:27:20] thirst but I say unto you that ye also
[1:27:24] have seen me and believe
[1:27:27] not and all that the father giveth me
[1:27:32] shall come to
[1:27:34] me and him that cometh to me I will in
[1:27:39] no wise cast out now you want to know a
[1:27:43] path
[1:27:45] forward he says all that cometh to me
[1:27:54] how do I believe believe on whom God
[1:27:56] hath
[1:27:58] sent he says for I came down from heaven
[1:28:03] not to do my own will but the will of
[1:28:07] him that sent
[1:28:09] me and this is the Father's
[1:28:12] will which hath sent me that of all
[1:28:18] which he hath given me I should lose
[1:28:24] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:28:29] the last
[1:28:30] day oh my I I hold that verse this is
[1:28:35] the will of the father this is what all
[1:28:38] that the father ha given me I won't lose
[1:28:41] one of
[1:28:49] them and this is the will of him that
[1:28:52] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[1:28:57] son and believeth on him may have
[1:29:01] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[1:29:06] in the last day what does see mean it
[1:29:10] doesn't mean with the eye it means to
[1:29:14] understand those that can understand him
[1:29:17] those that have Revelation those who
[1:29:21] eyes have been open to recognize the day
[1:29:24] and the hour that they're living those
[1:29:27] that hunger and thirst after
[1:29:29] righteousness they shall be filled
[1:29:32] either you're looking for God or you're
[1:29:34] looking for the things of the world
[1:29:37] either you want something that's
[1:29:38] Supernatural that transpire in your life
[1:29:42] real Revelation and what was given to
[1:29:46] this lady Ela I counsel thee to B give
[1:29:49] me IAM that I may a see
[1:29:56] scen
[1:30:00] everything seen
[1:30:03] everything if if we've been offered a
[1:30:07] lot of paths
[1:30:12] forward we've had preacher after
[1:30:15] preacher after preacher go into this
[1:30:17] message and pull something
[1:30:20] out and and we've been told
[1:30:24] Lo man will come and say he's here and
[1:30:28] he's
[1:30:30] there this is the way but let me tell
[1:30:33] you something anything that breaks
[1:30:36] Fellowship is
[1:30:52] Antichrist he let the
[1:30:55] path God provides the
[1:31:01] way let's read
[1:31:09] further everyone that
[1:31:11] seeth the
[1:31:15] sun oh how many times did he say it's
[1:31:19] not
[1:31:20] me it's him whatever he he
[1:31:28] said he looks out at the audience and he
[1:31:30] says who do you say this
[1:31:35] is he would discern the thoughts and
[1:31:38] intents of the heart and then he would
[1:31:40] look at us and say do you remember the
[1:31:42] woman at the
[1:31:45] well she saw a man just like you're
[1:31:48] seeing you're strangers one to another
[1:31:52] aren't we
[1:31:54] and he would absolutely lay the whole
[1:31:57] setting
[1:32:00] why because he was Reimers nating to the
[1:32:04] Gentiles the same thing that he did for
[1:32:07] the Jews and after he discerned her
[1:32:09] thoughts and intents she looked at him
[1:32:12] and she said sir I perceive that thou
[1:32:15] art a
[1:32:16] prophet and we know when the Messiah
[1:32:20] comes that he'll do these things a
[1:32:29] charlot but he spoke something that he
[1:32:32] hardly spoke to nobody else any place in
[1:32:35] the Bible he said I am
[1:32:41] he and I'll tell you the Gentile Church
[1:32:44] in this AG saw Jesus Christ standing in
[1:32:47] their mid doing the same works
[1:32:59] nothing's ever touched it nothing's ever
[1:33:02] matched
[1:33:04] it oh I wonder if we hold it in the
[1:33:08] regards that it ought to be
[1:33:11] held as we read down it gets better and
[1:33:14] better and better and
[1:33:18] better the Jews then murmured at him but
[1:33:22] he because he said
[1:33:24] I am the
[1:33:26] bread which comes
[1:33:29] down from
[1:33:31] heaven the path
[1:33:36] forward is the word
[1:33:40] bread you want to go
[1:33:45] forward I want to go
[1:33:47] forward I want to share with you this
[1:33:50] morning what I believe the path forward
[1:33:56] is and if we want to walk this path
[1:33:59] together then we'll pray one for another
[1:34:03] we'll lift one for other up we'll bear
[1:34:06] one another's burdens we'll come
[1:34:08] shoulder toosh shoulder we'll have a
[1:34:11] union that's promised in this day an
[1:34:13] invisible Union between the Earthly
[1:34:16] bride and the Heavenly bridegroom
[1:34:18] there'll be a
[1:34:22] Oneness but until you establish that
[1:34:25] absolute until you establish that path
[1:34:28] then you've just got people looking for
[1:34:31] this way and looking for that way and
[1:34:33] offering this to you and offering that
[1:34:36] with you but I'll tell you one thing in
[1:34:38] the name of the Lord my sheep know my
[1:34:40] voice and another they will not
[1:34:46] follow and I heard him stand right in
[1:34:48] the pit said I am the voice of God to
[1:34:51] you I know you resented that but I am
[1:34:54] the voice of God to
[1:34:59] you let us read
[1:35:07] down they just murmured at him because
[1:35:09] he said I am the bread which cometh down
[1:35:12] from heaven and they said is this not
[1:35:17] Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and
[1:35:22] mother we know
[1:35:24] how is it then that he saith I come down
[1:35:29] from
[1:35:30] heaven and Jesus therefore answered and
[1:35:33] said unto them murmur not among
[1:35:36] yourselves no man can come to me except
[1:35:41] the Father which hath sent me draw him
[1:35:46] and I will raise him up at the last
[1:35:50] day it is written in the the
[1:35:55] prophets and they shall be all taught of
[1:36:08] God best written in the
[1:36:12] prophets old and
[1:36:15] new
[1:36:18] Gentile and
[1:36:21] Jew it was written
[1:36:24] that the Jews would be
[1:36:26] taught by
[1:36:29] God and then he looks out and he says
[1:36:33] who do you say that the son of man
[1:36:40] is and then he looks at him he says as
[1:36:43] it is in the days of the son of man as
[1:36:47] it is in the days of Noah as it was in
[1:36:50] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:36:54] of the son of man what was it God in man
[1:36:59] teaching the
[1:37:02] people you want to know the path
[1:37:07] forward you want to know where God's
[1:37:09] trying to take the
[1:37:11] church we'll get into it in just a
[1:37:16] moment but we've almost forgot the
[1:37:19] reverence of this message that it was
[1:37:22] God teaching us
[1:37:25] God veiled in flesh the unveiling of God
[1:37:29] who do you say this mesed
[1:37:34] is why is man looking for another
[1:37:41] way man looks for another way when he
[1:37:44] doesn't accept the provided
[1:37:49] way and I'll say it and I hope it goes
[1:37:52] around I believe that every minister in
[1:37:57] this message from the north to the South
[1:38:01] to the East and to the West is obligated
[1:38:05] by God to play the tapes to their
[1:38:13] congregations why would you keep the
[1:38:15] word from
[1:38:17] them no I'm not playing the a tape this
[1:38:20] morning I believe in preaching
[1:38:26] the only thing they've done with the
[1:38:27] tapes is they added the word
[1:38:31] only I believe in press
[1:38:34] play but somebody came and added one
[1:38:37] word
[1:38:41] only they added one word
[1:38:45] surely takes one
[1:38:48] word one
[1:38:51] word if it takes one word how much more
[1:38:54] should we stay with the
[1:38:57] word it's my own personal
[1:39:00] belief but I'm honestly with you this
[1:39:04] morning I believe the path forward to
[1:39:07] the church lies in the storehouse of
[1:39:11] God's
[1:39:13] word I don't believe it lies in
[1:39:16] teachings of
[1:39:17] Revelations from that word I don't
[1:39:20] believe it lies in a movement of the
[1:39:23] spirit I believe it lies in the
[1:39:26] Revelation and the bread of the word the
[1:39:30] bread of
[1:39:32] life that's our path forward you say do
[1:39:35] we know it all no Lord feed
[1:39:44] me how much more is in
[1:39:49] there how could Paul said you're like
[1:39:52] babes
[1:39:54] you can only drink milk you're not ready
[1:39:57] for the strong meat of God's
[1:40:00] word the scripture comes back and says
[1:40:03] you're fools you compare yourselves one
[1:40:06] with another why why why do men do that
[1:40:09] because their eyes are off what what
[1:40:12] they should be
[1:40:14] on work out your own salvation with fear
[1:40:17] and
[1:40:18] trembling if you have questions about
[1:40:21] this message you need to pray yourself
[1:40:24] through until you have a beyond a shadow
[1:40:27] of a doubt you know that this is the
[1:40:31] Word of
[1:40:37] Life they'll be taught of
[1:40:47] God that every man
[1:40:52] therefore that that hath
[1:40:54] heard and hath learned of the father
[1:40:59] cometh to
[1:41:03] me
[1:41:05] well what's the path forward he that
[1:41:12] learnthe with to
[1:41:17] me if God ever does one thing one time
[1:41:21] he's got to do it a s
[1:41:26] he didn't leave this church into the
[1:41:28] hands of
[1:41:30] men that's why he said when the Holy
[1:41:33] Spirit comes and does these same works
[1:41:36] and you call it be elub there's no
[1:41:38] forgiveness for you in this life or the
[1:41:41] life to
[1:41:44] come because it was going to be
[1:41:47] more than a
[1:41:50] man you say no was brother Bram God no
[1:41:53] brother brand was a sinner saved by
[1:41:58] grace but it shows you the power of the
[1:42:01] blood shows you the power of a man that
[1:42:03] would dedicate himself to God and that's
[1:42:07] called and placed and
[1:42:13] elected I like what he said he said God
[1:42:16] just shows it to me I write it down and
[1:42:18] preach
[1:42:21] it you should you better better have
[1:42:25] confidence in the path you're
[1:42:36] on people have come to this
[1:42:41] conclusion I don't believe the path that
[1:42:43] brother David's
[1:42:48] on they thought it might be in the
[1:42:51] movement of the spirit
[1:42:53] and I give them
[1:42:57] credit for going
[1:43:00] forward and believing that's the path
[1:43:03] they ought to be on but let me tell you
[1:43:06] you better find a
[1:43:08] path because if you're lukewarm you'll
[1:43:10] be spilled out of his
[1:43:14] mouth you better find something in your
[1:43:18] life sir that becomes Your Divine
[1:43:21] leadership am your absolute your
[1:43:26] ultimate one of the last message he
[1:43:29] preached was leadership that this church
[1:43:32] was going to have to have
[1:43:35] Supernatural Divine
[1:43:38] leadership and you the Holy Spirit
[1:43:41] didn't even come to speak of himself but
[1:43:45] he came to bring you into remembrance of
[1:43:48] everything he taught
[1:43:55] I'm not yelling at you I'm trying to
[1:43:57] preach to
[1:44:07] myself not that any M man hath seen the
[1:44:12] father save he which is of god he hath
[1:44:18] seen the father verily verily I say unto
[1:44:21] you he that believeth
[1:44:23] on me have everlasting life I am the
[1:44:28] bread of
[1:44:30] life I believe the path forward is the
[1:44:34] bread of
[1:44:37] life your fathers that eat man in the
[1:44:40] wilderness and are dead this is the
[1:44:43] bread which cometh down from heaven that
[1:44:46] a man may eat thereof and not die
[1:44:53] you see
[1:44:55] what the path
[1:44:57] forward is to
[1:45:00] eat I am the living bread which cometh
[1:45:03] down from heaven If any man eat of this
[1:45:08] bread he shall live
[1:45:12] forever and the bread that I will give
[1:45:16] is my flesh which I will give for the
[1:45:20] life of the world and the Jews strove
[1:45:25] amongst themselves saying how can this
[1:45:27] man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus
[1:45:32] said un them verily verily i s un you
[1:45:36] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:45:44] man you
[1:45:47] you you can't miss that
[1:45:55] the bread I am the bread what was he yes
[1:46:00] he was a prophet he came in the form of
[1:46:02] a son of man God failed in
[1:46:06] flesh and now he and and to make it in
[1:46:10] that day they had to eat that
[1:46:14] word and then in order to be just to the
[1:46:17] Gentiles he comes right back in this day
[1:46:22] in the same Ministry no difference
[1:46:25] between the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:46:28] this last day Ministry except the
[1:46:30] Corporal body it was the Eternal Word
[1:46:33] truth of
[1:46:41] God he said if you don't
[1:46:44] eat the
[1:46:46] bread of
[1:46:49] life that the son of man is providing
[1:46:54] you'll
[1:47:00] perish so many of us believe and don't
[1:47:10] eat we just don't
[1:47:13] eat oh I got so much to go I just going
[1:47:18] to have to stop it's 11 11 o'clock
[1:47:23] is that clock
[1:47:25] right is it
[1:47:28] 12
[1:47:29] 11:40 all right I'll just try to close
[1:47:33] I'll I'll leave this part off except
[1:47:36] that you eat the Flesh of the son of man
[1:47:39] and drink his blood ye have no life In
[1:47:42] You whosoever eateth My Flesh and
[1:47:46] drinketh my blood hath eternal life and
[1:47:49] I'll raise him up at the last day for my
[1:47:53] flesh is meat indeed and my blood is
[1:47:57] drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[1:48:00] drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I
[1:48:04] in him as the living father hath sent me
[1:48:09] and I live by the father so he that
[1:48:14] eateth me even he shall live by
[1:48:20] me let me read that St
[1:48:24] again as the living father hath sent me
[1:48:28] and I live by the father verily verily I
[1:48:33] do
[1:48:37] nothing
[1:48:39] so he that eateth me even shall live by
[1:48:45] me this is that bread which came down
[1:48:51] from heaven now not as your fathers did
[1:48:54] eat mana and are dead he that eateth
[1:48:58] this bread shall live
[1:49:14] forever we find out Simply I just like
[1:49:16] to read if you Brothers if you go to
[1:49:18] harvest time I'll spend just a few
[1:49:20] moments reading some quotes to you this
[1:49:25] morning cuz I hope that you catch it cuz
[1:49:29] now he's preaching it's harvest
[1:49:33] time it's time to
[1:49:37] leave what have we been trying to tell
[1:49:39] you there's change
[1:49:42] happening God's changing the
[1:49:46] dedication the heart of the believer
[1:49:53] we're not here to
[1:49:55] condemn we're here to
[1:49:58] encourage I I'm the chiefest of Sinners
[1:50:02] I preached this to myself this
[1:50:05] morning it's so easy to run from the
[1:50:09] presence of
[1:50:13] God but to get in there
[1:50:17] knowing all that's been laid up for you
[1:50:22] it wasn't laid up for those people in
[1:50:24] the
[1:50:26] meetings they were there to see the
[1:50:29] Miracles but he left
[1:50:31] food he left
[1:50:34] bread he left substance CU he knew there
[1:50:38] was going to come a time in this country
[1:50:41] where there was such a drought for
[1:50:43] spiritual food that people would be
[1:50:46] chasing after this and chasing after
[1:50:49] that and going after this and trying to
[1:50:52] Manu manufacture this and Manufacturing
[1:50:54] that and here it's been sitting there
[1:50:57] all the
[1:51:00] time but you've got to make that
[1:51:03] decision within your own
[1:51:08] heart it's not by association it's not
[1:51:12] by Fellowship it's not by church
[1:51:16] membership it's by eating the book
[1:51:25] it's by eating the word now listen as we
[1:51:29] just read these statements if you would
[1:51:32] help me I'd like
[1:51:34] to just start with paragraph
[1:51:42] 70 it says now if this is kind of
[1:51:47] puzzling and about a man being Brad and
[1:51:50] being the word let's now go and search
[1:51:54] for this let's find out the scriptures
[1:51:58] are all true and they cannot be ever
[1:52:02] broken every scripture will be fulfilled
[1:52:06] no matter how strange it seems It's
[1:52:09] always be
[1:52:15] fulfilled paragraph
[1:52:21] 87 now now because I'm talking this
[1:52:24] morning about the path
[1:52:28] forward I I want to read to you now from
[1:52:32] the message Harvest Time what I believe
[1:52:36] the path forward
[1:52:38] is and if you believe I ask you to to
[1:52:43] join with me in a greater dedication to
[1:52:46] this message than we've ever had
[1:52:49] before if you're not then I ask you to
[1:52:53] seek with all your heart the path that
[1:52:56] you want to go down and find
[1:53:00] it is that
[1:53:04] fair Jesus
[1:53:07] said that they might be one father as
[1:53:11] you and I are
[1:53:15] one not for some men to be over
[1:53:19] something it never will work one
[1:53:23] denomination wants to take over the
[1:53:25] other and one man over the other one but
[1:53:31] that ye might be one with God like
[1:53:35] Christ and God was one that's what the
[1:53:41] prayer
[1:53:44] is that he was the word and Jesus prayed
[1:53:50] that we might might be the word
[1:53:55] reflecting
[1:53:57] him that is prayer to be
[1:54:05] answered that is his prayer to be
[1:54:11] answered that we will be
[1:54:16] one that we will reflect
[1:54:20] him you say which way do I want to go
[1:54:24] let's just let's just stay with it see
[1:54:27] Satan squabbles up the carnal mind but
[1:54:30] that wasn't Jesus prayer at all that we
[1:54:34] might all congregate together and all
[1:54:37] have a certain Creed and so forth every
[1:54:41] time they do it they go further and
[1:54:44] further from
[1:54:46] God it wasn't his will that we came up
[1:54:50] with a teaching and a
[1:54:54] Doctrine whether it be this coming
[1:54:57] whether it be that coming whether it be
[1:54:59] this anointing whether it be this
[1:55:03] teaching he said every time man tries to
[1:55:08] unite that way it takes him further from
[1:55:13] God is it
[1:55:19] plain and men go from pillar to
[1:55:26] post looking for something to latch on
[1:55:35] to he wants us to be one with God and
[1:55:40] God is the word each
[1:55:45] individual in his heart must be that one
[1:55:52] with
[1:55:56] God paragraph
[1:55:59] 101 that was his
[1:56:03] plan I am God he says I cannot change
[1:56:09] that's still his plan it's never his
[1:56:13] plan for Creeds or organizations or
[1:56:16] man-made rules and man shall live by
[1:56:23] rules that man shall
[1:56:25] live by by every word that proceedeth
[1:56:30] out of the mouth of God that's his
[1:56:36] plan so if I want to go
[1:56:39] forward the only way I can go forward is
[1:56:43] in his
[1:56:44] plan and his plan is to eat the word of
[1:56:49] God
[1:56:52] that's the path
[1:56:55] forward it's not coming up with
[1:56:58] something outside of what we've
[1:57:02] got it's letting what we've got change
[1:57:10] us paragraph
[1:57:13] 109 now
[1:57:15] see it's
[1:57:18] not it's not our good living that just
[1:57:22] something goes with it it isn't our
[1:57:26] church loyalty that go with it with it
[1:57:30] but the main thing is staying with that
[1:57:35] word don't eat nothing else but the word
[1:57:40] stay with it he is that word now we want
[1:57:45] to watch close
[1:57:47] now and he's going back to the Garden
[1:57:50] what did Satan get Eve to do to
[1:57:56] eat is that right when Jesus is up there
[1:58:00] being
[1:58:01] tempted what did Satan try to get him to
[1:58:05] do to
[1:58:08] eat what he Satan never changes his
[1:58:12] tactics what do you think he's going to
[1:58:15] try to get you to do eat something
[1:58:24] we got way too many
[1:58:26] chefs in the
[1:58:29] land God sent us one Vindicated
[1:58:33] scripturally identified Malachi 4:5 Luke
[1:58:38] 130 Revelations
[1:58:46] 10:7 paragraph 115
[1:59:00] don't put a bishop over it let the Holy
[1:59:03] Ghost stay over it see the Holy Ghost
[1:59:06] was sent to keep the weeds and things
[1:59:10] out not what the bishop thinks or an
[1:59:14] overseer or so forth it takes the Holy
[1:59:18] Spirit to keep that church in its
[1:59:21] condition he was that perfect word as we
[1:59:25] will
[1:59:27] see he says he say and he goes on to say
[1:59:31] that we have the same choice I'd like
[1:59:33] just to continue reading a few spots now
[1:59:36] he made everything work to his glory
[1:59:39] that's what his attributes are doing
[1:59:42] displaying his go Glory one vessel of
[1:59:46] honor and one of Dishonor but it's God
[1:59:50] that makes it not him that willth or him
[1:59:54] that runneth but God that showeth Mercy
[1:59:58] see no man can come to me said Jesus
[2:00:03] except my father draws him and all that
[2:00:07] the father hath this is paragraph 125
[2:00:11] past tense given to me will come to
[2:00:16] me to
[2:00:19] the word
[2:00:23] so if if all that the father had
[2:00:27] given him would come to
[2:00:32] him and that's the
[2:00:35] word then we know what the path forward
[2:00:40] is it's not something that someone's
[2:00:43] bringing up to us putting quotes
[2:00:47] together and making teachings
[2:00:54] you don't need something that's batched
[2:00:58] up if you understand
[2:01:02] if if it's already made for
[2:01:10] you just exactly to your
[2:01:14] taste just exactly to your
[2:01:19] need some of you have favorite food
[2:01:22] food we all give Jerome a hard time cuz
[2:01:26] he likes chicken you want to go to lunch
[2:01:28] let's go have chicken right Roman he's
[2:01:30] got places he likes Fried
[2:01:32] Chicken you know what I mean now I ain't
[2:01:36] gonna whoop up some old batch of some
[2:01:41] kind of bird and try to convince him to
[2:01:44] eat
[2:01:46] it you ought to know what you want to
[2:01:49] eat
[2:01:55] we ought to know what this message does
[2:01:57] for us when we listen to it when we read
[2:02:01] it and when we obey
[2:02:04] it and I'm going to try to hurry here
[2:02:07] because I I want to read some statements
[2:02:10] about our
[2:02:18] Bible he said the word how how can they
[2:02:22] come unless they were are all they were
[2:02:27] foreordained to come as many as received
[2:02:32] him to them gave he power to become the
[2:02:37] sons of God see cuz their names were on
[2:02:42] the book he come to redeem what was on
[2:02:46] the book okay isn't that really what
[2:02:49] we've all been Desiring is to be the
[2:02:52] pure Sons and Daughters of God as
[2:02:55] brother Jim I just love that just one
[2:02:58] day he dropped that scripture i in it
[2:03:00] was like my whole life changed herein is
[2:03:04] the love of God made perfect as he is so
[2:03:10] are we in this world that's our
[2:03:15] path we already know that power without
[2:03:21] character
[2:03:23] satanic you can't be sitting there
[2:03:25] having a big college television football
[2:03:28] blowout
[2:03:29] party and the next morning be sitting in
[2:03:32] church running around speaking in
[2:03:34] tongues and prophesying that's what he
[2:03:37] that's what he he he just blasted the
[2:03:39] church for
[2:03:42] that but you know the best way to get
[2:03:44] rid of that conviction is take his voice
[2:03:48] out of the church
[2:03:54] because you know what happens when you
[2:03:55] put on a tape something will sneak up
[2:03:57] out of that
[2:03:59] tape that you
[2:04:02] missed but what set you
[2:04:05] free the truth set you free Jesus said I
[2:04:10] am the way the truth the life no man
[2:04:13] comes to the father but by me and he was
[2:04:16] the
[2:04:20] word Jesus brought his word to this
[2:04:25] generation and identified it if you took
[2:04:29] every
[2:04:30] Doctrine in every Bible teaching from
[2:04:33] every church and you put it through the
[2:04:36] filter of God's word a great big funnel
[2:04:40] and you filtered it through the filter
[2:04:42] of God's word what you would have what
[2:04:44] after it all got filtered is the message
[2:04:47] of the
[2:04:48] hour cuz it's the truth
[2:04:52] you saywell brother brandom's come and
[2:04:55] gone he did what God had him to do the
[2:04:58] truth that he taught was the Eternal
[2:05:01] Word of God not the 20th century word of
[2:05:08] God and it was left for
[2:05:12] you to
[2:05:16] eat he said if you eat this bread you
[2:05:21] you will have the power to become the
[2:05:24] Sons and Daughters of
[2:05:30] God that's
[2:05:32] life you talk about getting something
[2:05:44] answered as many as received him he gave
[2:05:47] power to become the sons of God cuz
[2:05:50] their names are written on on the Lamb's
[2:05:52] Book of Life he come to redeem them on
[2:05:55] the book over here he says he's trying
[2:05:57] to find a man that would live the whole
[2:06:01] word of God would you turn with me to
[2:06:03] paragraph
[2:06:06] 143 are you there
[2:06:09] Brothers now this is our path
[2:06:12] forward this is what he's trying to
[2:06:15] bring us to this is what eating his word
[2:06:18] will do for
[2:06:20] us we are
[2:06:23] we as
[2:06:24] Christians are only reflecting
[2:06:27] him the moon only reflects the son in
[2:06:31] its absence and the believer only
[2:06:35] reflects the Son of God in the absence
[2:06:39] of the Son of
[2:06:42] God
[2:06:44] is it's the light
[2:06:48] of the Bible

[2:09:29] portion he had it without a portion we
[2:09:32] are the
[2:09:34] stars that shining all of us together
[2:09:38] makes the light to the world but he is
[2:09:42] the entire son that reflects the light
[2:09:46] to every Star Hallelujah I believe him
[2:09:50] God help
[2:09:52] my
[2:09:56] unbelief you want to go forward get rid
[2:10:00] of your
[2:10:02] unbelief quit calling yourself Devils
[2:10:05] quit running yourself down for your
[2:10:11] past you you've heard the expression you
[2:10:14] can lead a horse of water but you can't
[2:10:16] make them drink drink come drink from
[2:10:19] the Fountain of Life free
[2:10:21] [Music]
[2:10:26] really you think if if there was a a
[2:10:31] drought in the
[2:10:33] land and there is a bottle of water in
[2:10:35] this
[2:10:37] church you don't think a sinner would
[2:10:39] find his way through those doors that he
[2:10:42] could get a drink of Living
[2:10:44] Water sure he
[2:10:48] would and you've got it on your Comm
[2:10:51] computers you've got it on your phones
[2:10:54] you've got it in books you've got it on
[2:11:02] tapes i i i i Marvel at myself how
[2:11:06] little I
[2:11:09] drink going have to turn these into
[2:11:16] glass how little
[2:11:25] the path
[2:11:39] forward that's what he
[2:11:42] does this is paragraph 48 and that's
[2:11:47] what he does to every
[2:11:49] organization that's what he does to to
[2:11:51] every individual he tries to give you
[2:11:55] the natural things that you can look at
[2:11:59] and it takes you away well look at this
[2:12:03] great big church why they got so many
[2:12:06] millions in it our church is the biggest
[2:12:09] church in the city well we have the
[2:12:12] mayor comes to our church see all that
[2:12:16] our pastor has a degree a DD an LD a pH
[2:12:21] d That's well that well he he is uh
[2:12:26] bound to be a smart man a Catholic
[2:12:29] priest can come around and cover him
[2:12:32] over any time with his
[2:12:35] degrees he's got 60 some odd books he
[2:12:40] has to know as bad as much as you know
[2:12:44] the
[2:12:45] Bible to get his degree to be a priest
[2:12:49] so don't try to compare educ
[2:12:51] ation that's just like the world it's
[2:12:55] always trying to compare don't compare
[2:12:58] with things of the world don't compare
[2:13:02] with churches compare with the
[2:13:07] Bible that's what we're we're doing
[2:13:11] today that's
[2:13:13] what the matter with us Pentecostal
[2:13:17] churches that's what the matter with our
[2:13:21] qu quartets and singers and so forth as
[2:13:25] we have we're trying to act like
[2:13:28] Hollywood Hollywood Glitters the gospel
[2:13:32] glows there is a difference between a
[2:13:35] glitter and a glow see Hollywood
[2:13:38] Glitters from clothes and Ricky and
[2:13:41] ricettas and
[2:13:44] rickettes but God humbly glows in
[2:13:49] humility of
[2:13:51] the
[2:13:53] believer no matter how ignorant he is he
[2:13:58] glows in humility not shines in
[2:14:03] Hollywood paragraph
[2:14:06] 53 now Satan tries the same tactics on
[2:14:10] Jesus he tries on the rest of them he
[2:14:14] tried to make him eat something besides
[2:14:18] the promised bread work
[2:14:24] word you see how clear the path forward
[2:14:29] is this is Harvest
[2:14:34] time because Jesus said it is written
[2:14:37] man shall not live by bread alone see he
[2:14:41] tried to make him obey him though it
[2:14:45] looked pretty good looked like he could
[2:14:48] feed himself he could have done it it
[2:14:52] and he says 55 you notice they tried to
[2:14:55] make him eat something besides the bread
[2:14:58] of life that every man should live by
[2:15:02] but Jesus stayed with the father's word
[2:15:07] oh he didn't hit
[2:15:10] Eve oh he didn't hit Eve then he never
[2:15:15] hit Moses he never hit any of the rest
[2:15:18] of them he hit one was going to reflect
[2:15:23] every
[2:15:25] word when he ran into
[2:15:32] him reflect every
[2:15:35] word
[2:15:38] see he is he that's the reason he was
[2:15:43] the
[2:15:44] word but Jesus stayed with the word
[2:15:48] refusing his theary s Cemetary Doctrine
[2:15:52] yes sir his new light his more
[2:15:57] experience he couldn't push it on Jesus
[2:16:01] like he pushed it off on Eve to show her
[2:16:04] oh surely
[2:16:06] God do you hear what he
[2:16:09] said his new
[2:16:14] light everybody goes to the same books
[2:16:17] the same tapes and for some reason
[2:16:20] people can come up with new
[2:16:24] light let's get the light that's in
[2:16:35] there but this is what he said now we
[2:16:38] find out that he failed Jesus went right
[2:16:41] back to him with thus sayeth the Lord
[2:16:45] now this is 57 now when he sees that
[2:16:49] believer watch the believer come in the
[2:16:53] same category now each one of
[2:16:56] you when he sees you're going to stay
[2:17:01] with the Bible yes I believe the Bible I
[2:17:05] ain't joining no Creed the things out
[2:17:08] there I'm going to stay with the Bible
[2:17:12] and and as ever if he can't get you to
[2:17:16] believe it to live a real true
[2:17:21] and to believe the word I want you to
[2:17:23] notice what he done to Jesus the second
[2:17:27] time if he ain't get you I ain't going
[2:17:31] to join no Creed I'm going to I'm I was
[2:17:37] born free I'm going to stay with it I'm
[2:17:40] going to do this or to do that see we're
[2:17:43] we're of that category you know so what
[2:17:46] he what what he tries to do he tries to
[2:17:48] educate you
[2:17:53] substitute let's just read 60 and we're
[2:17:56] closing but Jesus said when he the
[2:18:00] spirit of Truth has come see he will
[2:18:03] bring all these things that I have
[2:18:06] taught you to your memory the word and
[2:18:10] he'll show you things to come there is
[2:18:14] the real Spirit-filled church now stays
[2:18:18] with the word
[2:18:21] reflects the word God on Earth he
[2:18:26] doesn't need any Theologian because his
[2:18:29] word is of no private
[2:18:32] interpretation he interprets his own
[2:18:35] word by vindicating it and proving it to
[2:18:39] be true paragraph
[2:18:43] 177 now watch as we hurry through when
[2:18:46] the spirit of Truth is come he will
[2:18:49] teach you all all things whatsoever I
[2:18:52] have taught you oh my bearing all
[2:18:56] remembrance to you what I've said to you
[2:19:00] bring to you all remembrance he will
[2:19:04] show you things to come he will
[2:19:06] vindicate every word confirming it the
[2:19:10] word with signs following everything
[2:19:13] that he promised that God promised in
[2:19:16] the Bible if you'll turn turn loose of
[2:19:20] every Creed and everything else and hold
[2:19:25] unto the word God is obligated to take
[2:19:29] care of his word and so when you do this
[2:19:33] the word
[2:19:35] vindicates
[2:19:38] itself and then turning and reading in
[2:19:43] 278 now the second Eve watch her she was
[2:19:47] created a new like he was on the day of
[2:19:50] Pentecost filled with the
[2:19:54] spirit and
[2:19:56] fed by the
[2:19:58] word now I'm getting religious I feel
[2:20:02] good that first church that first Eve
[2:20:06] which was to be Christ's bride how many
[2:20:09] can say Amen she was to be Christ's
[2:20:13] bride she was born at Pentecost not Nia
[2:20:17] Rome not in London England not not in
[2:20:21] the United States not in Germany with
[2:20:24] Luther not in England with Wesley not in
[2:20:27] the United States with Pentecost
[2:20:29] so-called she was born on the day of
[2:20:31] Pentecost she was Spirit-filled she was
[2:20:35] Spirit-filled and word fed every word
[2:20:40] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[2:20:43] even to
[2:20:45] Judas oh they just had to
[2:20:48] take everything just just word by word a
[2:20:53] real blooming plant on God's Earth
[2:20:57] representing him another bride tree how
[2:21:02] did she have to take it word by
[2:21:07] word that was Satan's other trick just
[2:21:11] put it in one great big
[2:21:13] conclusion one great big
[2:21:17] explanation package it up into one big
[2:21:21] thought that's not a
[2:21:23] path a path is something you go down
[2:21:27] that's a
[2:21:31] camp when you got it all figured out and
[2:21:35] you got all the doctrine and you got the
[2:21:37] teaching this is what we believe this is
[2:21:40] our terminology this is how we look at
[2:21:43] this this is how we look at that this is
[2:21:46] what brother Bram said this is what
[2:21:48] brother brandham meant that's not a p
[2:21:51] that's a
[2:21:54] camp does that bring a message to mind
[2:21:58] going
[2:22:00] beyond the
[2:22:03] camp the footsteps of the righteous are
[2:22:06] led by the Lord what's the path
[2:22:10] forward the path forward is word by word
[2:22:13] line upon line precept upon precept I'm
[2:22:17] a part of this word I'm going to live by
[2:22:20] this word I'm going to feed on this
[2:22:24] word he
[2:22:27] said his Word of Promise reflects him in
[2:22:32] her paragraph
[2:22:34] 279 they had to take notice to Peter and
[2:22:38] them they hadn't been to
[2:22:41] Seminary and they know that they hadn't
[2:22:44] been to any Bible School some
[2:22:46] theological
[2:22:48] Cemetery Seminary they had no education
[2:22:52] because they couldn't even write their
[2:22:54] own name the Bible said they were
[2:22:57] ignorant and unlearned but what happened
[2:23:01] they had taken note they had been with
[2:23:05] Jesus and there he was in them
[2:23:09] reflecting his promise glory glory to
[2:23:14] God that's what we need in this age his
[2:23:19] word reflect in him in her the
[2:23:23] church she was alive by every word that
[2:23:28] proceedeth out of the
[2:23:31] mouth of
[2:23:35] God I think I have one last
[2:23:40] statement look here there must come
[2:23:43] forth a true
[2:23:44] seed paragraph
[2:23:48] 297 there has got to be cuz he's coming
[2:23:53] for the bride without spot or wrinkle
[2:23:57] he's coming for it a word Vindicated
[2:24:01] bride oh she'll be such a little bitty
[2:24:05] group Jesus said as it was in the days
[2:24:08] of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved
[2:24:11] is that right so shall it be in the
[2:24:14] coming of the son of man how many I
[2:24:17] don't know but see the bride is is going
