strength is gone let the Beast of pass all I understand cover me cover me amen that's our heart's desire this morning amen God bless you let's go ahead and pray Heavenly Father truly we depend upon your covering father the only right we have to come into your presence Lord the way that that's been made has been dependent upon your covering Lord a perfect covering yes one Lord that hides us from what hides hides what we've done from you puts it in the sea of forgetfulness but also it gives us a robe an identity Lord some uh some right that gives us that we may come into your presence Lord and to lay hold of your word and to put it in motion Lord to lift up our hands and to you we thank you for your covering Lord we pray you'd be with us today now we commit the service to you Lord as always the work that's done here if it's just the work of man would just be another religious gathering but Lord we are hanging on your word that says that if just a couple of us come together in your name you promis to be there Lord we commit the service to you Lord that your word would have the preeminence that your name would be lifted up Lord that every need would be met and that you draw us closer to you we pray these things in Jesus name amen may be seated going to read Psalm 28 this morning if you want to go ahead and turn there and you know one thing that's stuck out to me as I was reading that this week is it's a Psalm that mentions the hands three times and as I was reading that you know the thought occurred to me it it matters where you have your hands it matters what your hands are doing it matters what your hands are handling you know in verse three and 4 it speaks of the workers of iniquity those that that prefer to do their own thing and the works that their hands are involved in David refers to it as the works of their own hands and it produces results that are associated with that work you know it says in verse 5 that it's destruction The Works that they're doing aren't resulting in anything being being built up but is resulting in their own destruction in verse 5 it speaks of God's hands God's hands are involved in a work in fact the destruction of those whose hands are busy doing their own thing is because they regard not the work of the Lord nor the operation of his hands see it matters what our hands are doing what our hands are handling and if you read in verse two there's an interesting statement there says hear the voice of my supplications when I cry unto thee when I lift up my hands toward thy holy Oracle well what's what's a holy Oracle that's kind of a strange word words matter in the scriptures fact it's not mentioned anywhere else in the Psalms but it's mentioned quite a bit in First Kings as Solomon is working on building the Temple it says in First Kings 65 and against the wall of the house he built Chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the Oracle and he made Chambers round about the temple and the Oracle were two different things says in verse 16 and he built 20 cubits on the the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with Boards of Cedar he even built them for it within even for the Oracle even for the most high place you see not only is there a difference between the temple and the Oracle but that Oracle was that most holy place that holy of holies and then if you read on in verse 19 and the Oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord so it was that holy of holies where that Ark sat and it was that place where he dwelt between the Cherub him that Mercy Seat it was the place of his presence so when we read Psalm 28:2 that says when I lift up my hands toward thy holy Oracle this is something more than lifting up your hands in church service or in prayer but it's reaching out to his presence Webster describes Oracle as a person or a place through whom a deity is believed to speak or where a deity reveals hidden knowledge or Divine Purpose well Amen brother Webster John makes an interesting statement because he says notice in Psalm 28 he doesn't lift up his eyes he does doesn't lift up his voice he doesn't lift up his heart or his mind he lifts up his hands it matters what you're doing with your hands John said in 1 John 1:1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the words of Life see I think all of us can say that we've seen something that our eyes have been opened to the word I think we would all agree that we've heard something that our ears have been opened but the question is are we taking our hands and are we lifting them up to that Holy Oracle and are we laying hold of his presence and putting that word to work are we laying hold of it working it becoming practiced with it that which our hands have handled I will lift up my hands to thy holy Oracle let's go ahead and stand this morning you know as I was reading that it occurs to me that it matters what our hands are doing and my prayer is that I get beyond what I've seen and what I've heard and I get Beyond just simply lifting My Hands In Worship or in prayer but I take my hands and I lay hold of that word of life that Holy Oracle where his presence is found for myself let's read that psalm 28 this morning starting in verse one unto thee will I Cry Oh Lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me I become like them that go down into the pit hear the voice of my supplications when I cry unto thee when I lift up my hands toward thy holy Oracle draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbors but Mischief is in their hearts give them according to their deeds s and according to the wickedness of their Endeavors give them after the work of their hands render to them their deserve because they regard not the works of the Lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up blessed be the Lord because Heath heard the voice of my supplications the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise him the Lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever amen amen God bless you may have your seats man certainly want to welcome our visitors the Mandi family it's nice to have them and it's

throne of grace this morning thankful that the blood has been applied and that you're a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so Lord we're bringing these needs that have been mentioned unto you Lord we know that we've been given the promise that by your stripes we're already healed so Lord we're wanting our faith just to rise up and claim and speak those things that you've already given to the believer Lord there's many needs that are in the body sickness so Lord we continue to lift them up to you Lord we continue to remember brother Tommy's sister and brother manet's Mother and Lord there's uh we think of uh don Lawson the relative of sister Lorie silers there's there's needs that have been brought before this desk Lord and we know that prayer is the answer it's the key as your Prophet told us it's the most powerful weapon that's ever been put in the hands of man no atomic bomb there's no hydrogen bomb nothing as powerful as prayer and committal to you Lord so we're your believing children now we're coming together and we're we're committing these needs to you Lord knowing that you've for saw these needs Lord and you've already made a way so we just love you Lord we commit these needs into thy hands Lord we ask a blessing upon the tithes and the offerings in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise the Lord you may be seated we just want to uh make a um an announcement um and before we we make an announcement for um the meetings uh we're we're wanting to make an effort to before the service as we know the prophet said you should get to Service uh 20 to 30 minutes early well we got one amen you know to help create an atmosphere and uh what we we're wanting to do is try to place some of the needs up on the on the screen so as you come in 20 to 30 minutes early um that some of the needs will be placed up there so if we could just bind together in prayer uh some of the needs are ongoing um we have ones amongst us that have been believing for for miracles and some that are battling cancer so we just want to bind together in prayer um and bear one another's burdens as the scripture would say um and if if you could email those if you have a prayer request or something you want the church Church to be in prayer for if you could email the church or um you could send me a message we want to make an effort to get that up um you know in the busyness of life um and I just personally just to let you know I I was in talking to brother joean and he he mentioned uh brother Manet and his mother had just started uh chemo and and I had I had forgot that and I felt bad I'm like I'm I totally forgot that and I I realized man I need to I need to keep that on my heart and I think you you know the church is going through Growing Pains we're getting bigger and bigger and bigger and so I think things like that will be a very good tool so just email the church um or like I said you can send a a note to myself and we'll we'll try to get that up on the screen and uh we can start to be in prayer uh constantly for these burdens and we can make it a special effort to get here a little bit earlier Prayer Changes Things amen and uh we're just uh really excited uh for uh brother Craig Bo is going to be joining us um we're going to have some meetings on February the 16th through the 18th um Friday night um on the 16th we'll it's going to be a youth setting just more of a fellowship for the Youth um at this time uh we'll have more details to come but with the youth we'll probably be meeting at my home and just have a little Fellowship uh there uh but I'm really excited about um the uh Saturday morning on the 17th um we're going to have a Children's Service um it'll be at 11:00 a.m. and this is for the church uh it's not for babysitting for you to drop your kids off and leave um but this is a a a church service but you know brother brandham uh many time I say many times but I know there were times where brother brandham would Minister and he'd ask all the children to come up front and sit around and he'd minister to those children and and we're wanting to just make make a a special service for our children that Saturday so we'll have them come up front and brother Craig uh will minister to the children it'll be tailored for them and uh but we we want as much participation uh special meetings means a special effort uh so it's in three weeks so if uh you need to take off time or whatever you can do I think it'll be a blessing and then we'll have um an evening service that Saturday um at 6: p.m. will be geared for the Youth but I I believe that every service we have is a youth service CU we're all just about 18 21 years old whether you know it or not we we have a body on the other side that it's going to pick us up and you know that's what it's all about and then we'll only have one service that Sunday um on the 18th at 11:00 a.m. and um uh if you haven't um been acquainted with brother Craig Bo and his family um and his ministry it's going to be a a wonderful blessing so remember that in prayer uh we'll we'll um have some more announcements to follow as uh we we're trying to have some activities following that Children's Service and things like that but just be in prayer for that and I'm looking forward to what God has in store God bless you amen and I hope you an expectation

this with the faith that Jack Ryan had oh Hallelujah I believe it father when they receive their inspiration from the message something's bound to happen father bless us this morning we pray each one in Jesus wonderful name amen amen God bless you this morning I'm going to have Billy read my scripture uh I tried to print out some quotes this morning so I have to put it on my computer with the letters about this big but when I went to print it they came out this small so if I I brought my magnifying glass and I if if if that helps if it don't uh would you just suffer with me um I I I'm I'm like half of barnas so uh but he healed him right and and didn't our sister sing this morning If He Did It Before He'll Do It Again amen he's not limited in power you know he could create another world just like that but he had a purpose didn't he he had a purpose why we are the way we are why we're in the place that we're in he had a purpose and it was to manifest his attributes he wanted to show himself to you and and his greatness oh I I hope we can just say something this morning that'll bless you but uh the scripture that we're going to read is in Romans chap 12 and uh I think it starts with the first verse so uh brother Billy will come and and read that and uh Romans uh 12 chapter one uh it says I bee I besee you therefore Brethren by the Mercies of God that ye present your bodies as Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be ye not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Amen God bless you may be seated amen yeah so uh we we've we said that we would try to minister a little to you out of the uh uh message uh Power of transformation and so we want to kind of uh uh go to that uh uh uh portion of it and uh this morning and I I have some big notes but I don't don't know if uh we'll be able to do it but I want to fellowship if I could this morning if I would have a title uh and I would I would call it the law of the seed the law of the seed and uh somebody uh made mention to me the other day I I thought it was uh uh kind of humorous in in the way that uh uh he was expressing uh you know I know on not a very excitable uh uh preacher in any way uh but you know a pastor really doesn't have any uh the gift of an evangelist you know what I mean or the gift of uh a a prophet and all those he's sort of a a combination of of all of them together you know what I mean so sometimes he might be a little Evangelistic sometimes he's more uh of uh you know uh teaches a little bit to this morning probably a little more on on the teaching side but his his desire is to feed the sheep uh it not so much how they're fed but what they're fed and uh the the the comment was made that that I just don't uh uh preach uh like the the the brothers in Africa and I thought well how does an African preach and then I thought well Billy's an African and and Ben W I don't know if he's here today but he's an African and Brother Paul's an African you know and I guess I preach like an Irishman you know what I mean so it's it's not how it said that's important it's what it said and our our goal and our purpose is to take from the storehouse and and remember the vision of the storehouse was to supply food that was going to be needed there are things in the message today that for years we bypassed because there didn't seem to be a a driving and a dying need for them but as the time came the Holy Spirit shed light on on that portion of the message and all of a sudden it became food amen you know and it and it started to feed our soul and I I've gone through my books I mean nowadays most of the people have phones and T and everything I didn't grow up with those so I grew up with books and I remember how that I would wait at my door about the time that the message were was being printed um my both of my these brothers have gone on to be with the Lord but brother Roy borders and brother Doug mugh started voice of God in their garage in Tucson and they started to print little books out and they would mail them out you you know what I mean and we used to wait for those books you know what I mean and tapes were unreal to reals you know they that we had boxes of real reels and we would have to get the machine and thread it through there and and then it would break and then we'd go out and buy a tape splicer you you know what I mean and and if we if we missed a portion oh we were devastated you know but that's what we we started on you know what I mean and so if you go back to my office I got little pieces of paper sticking out of books you know and and things are underlined and I'll go back to a book and there I skip paragraphs you know what I mean and now I go back and I read them and I'm filling in places that I filled in before you know I'd like to come to the day where everything that was in there stuck to me just became rich Rich to me so I want to uh try to minister something to you this morning that will help your understanding and give you Victory okay and and and I want to do it in in such a manner that you can look past your faith excuse me past your flesh to the promise okay it's because of by the promises of God that you're partakers of divine nature not through your flesh but by his word not by not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord and so you might look at yourself as a very weak CHR Christian but that doesn't matter in the eyes of God because he knows who you are he he knows who you are and and so uh when when we we go to uh understand that uh we it is going to bring us to something that we can turn our hearts to and and what the message we were reading from was called God's power to transform okay so God's power uh God's power to transform and transform means to what to change so it doesn't matter where you're at as long as you can grab a hold and understand and have faith in that God has the power to change that amen I remember the couple that they were they were they they had fallen apart and they got coldhearted towards one another and and and they were starting to break up and everything and then then they they were finally dividing the stuff up you know you take this I'll take that oh I'll trade you the boat for the car you know what I mean they were going through all the stuff you know what I mean and and bitter you you know what I mean and and uh you know just just uh I you know just vile towards one another right so finally they got into the Attic So they got everything downstairs straightened up and everything she said you take the lawnmower I'll take the flowers and and they had all their junk piled up you know what I mean and their hearts are just and they got in the Attic now they're going through boxes in the attic and finally they open this box and there was a pair of baby shoes in there and they both reach for the baby shoes and all of a sudden it was restored to them what they came together in the first place for and don't you think that it would be good for us to have restored in our hearts why we became Christians in the first place that's right you understand so God doesn't matter what road you've been down come on son he doesn't matter what your past is he provided something for your past it's called the blood of Jesus Christ which cleanses us from all righteousness a amen he's got the chalkboard right there and so you could have all these list of things that is held against you now God doesn't lay those things to your charge Satan lays those things to your charge because who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect no why not because the seed of God remaineth in them so the minute that you confess those sins he's faithful and just to what forgive so all she's waiting for is for your part to say Aba father I'm sorry amen where did they go in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more and and I I I'm not saying this is a Doctrine uh this statement I'm going to make right now but sometimes it's I say this about myself I I wonder why that I sometimes remember the things that I've done wrong or the things if there isn't still a part of me that wants some of it you know what I mean that I haven't completely died out to it yet you you know what I mean and and and so if I haven't what do I know I know that God has got a power to transform God's power to change God's power to bring something from one place to another no it's we don't have that power that's right you understand we want to go into that just a a little bit if you if you'll help me navigate this morning so we we've got to rely on on something yeah we and and you know if I could say it this way God does everything he put everything in order when he created is that right he when he created the heavens and earth everything had its place everything had its order and God creates everything that God does comes by his word that's right you understand so we don't know what's in God's mind right but when he speaks itl you understand now he's expressing his thought and what is a word it's the thought expressed so he speaks the he he thinks it in his mind it's there in his mind now God's not isn't in the element of time and that's one of the things that cripples our faith right is the time element it's it's a crippling to our faith CU if you're sick for so many years then that wears on your faith but God said you're healed God told Abraham you're going to have a baby you know he's already 80 I guess and how many more years does he go before he has a baby but what settled it what settled it was God said so in other words God spoke his thought so God in his mind Reich was going to use Abraham to start a lineage to bring his son he had it all in his mind exactly he had in his mind how that Abraham would have Isaac and Isaac would get Rebecca and they would have they would have these 12 sons and one of them would be a type of Christ and would go sit on the throne in Egypt oh my goodness God knows how to write a story he knows how to do things amen we we don't want we don't want anything around us to hinder the the ability of our mind to catch a hold of God and that's what our scripture says this morning by the renewing of your mind by the washing of the water of the word and so God expresses it he said let there be light now we could have all sat around and come up with all kinds of our ideas of what light is going to be some of us might say oh light is going to be a delicious tasting drink and oh my that is and it's just going to change your whole uh uh being and body that's what light is well that's perverted definition of light that's what they got today they got this light that light you know no we knew what light was what God had in his mind when he brought it to pass don't forget these fundamental principles that are Prophet gave us because he gave us these fundamental principles because now we need them more than ever because of the ground that we're navigating and the path that's set before us I'll tell you people that are separating themselves from this message are going to find the road that they're on is got a dead end and they're going to have to return back to the GPS of God's word and order to find your way that's right amen and you know how I feel I I it it's it's deeply in my heart I believe in preaching with all my heart and but I also believe that every congregation should listen to tapes as a congregation not just at at home I I because it's the source of everything we believe it it's it's the source of our Doctrine it's the source of Our Truth in fact there was secrets that were held in the word of God that were hid until the revelation of Malachi 4:5 the opening of the seals the secrets that were that were contained that were to give us rapturing faith and and you just can't deprive the people from hearing these things you know there there should be nobody don't don't let anybody get in between your relationship of the tapes let me just don't call it tapes the word of God brought to you in this day the spoken word of God yet nothing get in the way of the spoken word of God speaking to you directly Hall the church is built on Revelation it's built on on on on Revelation so we know what the what God meant in his mind when he said let there be light we now now now he was obligated Hallelujah to give the Revelation hold hold this for a second to give the revelation of what light is and what he meant and he did that by bringing it to pass now the word of God says that God must be worshiped in spirit and in truth so we know that Thy word is truth so what is the spirit the spirit is the intention or the interpretation of what he meant when he spoke the word hallelujah that's why the rain can fall on the just and unjust they can all Rejoice together not one side don't Rejoice the believer rejoice just from the rain just like the unbeliever join what separates the two right is one has the spirit not the anointing right right right okay not the rain which God gave that to to everybody but they have the Divine Vindicated interpretation of the word now they can walk in the spirit of the truth you understand what I'm saying so the spirit fell some spoke in tongues then some people went and they made that the evidence of the spirit so they would come into the emotionalism they would come into the anointing they would come into the blessings they would speak in tongues and they would say this is the evidence of the Holy Spirit that's not the spirit of it that's right right that's not what the spirit of God was given for the spirit of God was given to you that you could receive by divine revelation the full revealed word of God you can't separate the two the prophet of God said if the holy spirit is God's father and the father was Jesus's father he has two fathers that's right on come on and that won't work so you can't separate yourself from the word of God either you can't you can't separate yourself from the word of God you may not be everywhere that you want to be in your mind and you might not be everywhere you are by reading the Bible and coming under your conviction but by the law of the seed you will be what God said you would be and he will interpret you he'll do it amen so so there there's a law and that law is that everything will bring forth of its kind now so you help me this morning so everything would be forth of its kind so we we go back to the Garden of Eden and God had placed everything the way that he wanted it is that right everything was in order he came down and walked in the cool of the evening he saw Adam was lonely he said it's not good for man to be alone I'll give him a help mate so he takes Eve from Adam and he looks at her said I'll call her woman bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and and and now uh we know just by teachings that there was attributes and characteristics that Adam had in him and he took some of those attributes and character istics if we want to say that the feminine side and he's placed them over in another body but that these two bodies may become one that was his purpose so we know in the meantime that there was a great angel in heaven that was named Lucifer and our scriptures tell us that Lucifer wanted to exalt himself above Michael and above all his angels he wanted the preeminence he wanted to be the one so he kind of got hung up on all the gifts that God had given him Lucifer was gifted God endowed him with with many uh tremendous abilities and and and anointings and that's why it's real important for ministers not to let the anointing that they come under get to them that's it like it's something that they've got no it it it it it it that doesn't make you anything the only way that you should judge any Ministry is by the substance of the word that they [Music] speak by the text if I could say it that way and so you and so so Lucifer comes along because he never repented of his desire to exalt himself so he finds Eve in the garden doesn't he and he he beguiles her now there is a difference between defile and beguile he had to beguile her first before the defilement came that's the pattern of sin how many knows that first of all it comes in your mind and it draws you away after your flesh and then it's the the ACT is performed and then the sin is conceived but there had to be a seed that came in first something that came in and beguiled you and deceived you and brought you to the uh the defilement or the birth of the sin how many knows that's in the Bible that's that's ABCs you know what I mean sin starts where in the mind that's why it's important you know that's the trouble I might as well say if I'm your pastor and if they want to blank this off on the tape or turn the volume down it's great but that's the trouble why in this lady of see an age that 70% of all marriages fail cuz people go out and they watch all this pornography they watch all this stuff and then they expect they're going to get that stuff in their marriage Lord that's sick those are fakes it's acting it's for money it's it's the it's the devil it's just like looking Glamour magazine and think that you're going to go buy some cream whoop it on your face and all of a sudden you're going to be some kind of beauty queen well you ought to go read Proverbs what they say about beauty oh she looks beautiful but she's got fangs you know oh she's pretty till she opens her mouth I want bite you with poison give me your neck you got to come into reality it's just like mirrors mirrors are made for you to look at forward not to you got to get rid of that junk okay so so that's the pattern of sin so he came and beg child Eve he said I surely you won't die and I've got something to offer you well what did he want to offer her he wanted to exalt himself above her he wanted to be in control of her Destiny he wanted to bring forth his idea of Eden okay so he had to have a pathway to to bring forth his idea of what he wanted to have because Lucifer was the one that was given the understanding of Science of Education of civilization so he could look from his perch by what God's given him and God spoke something God Did It by his word but Lucifer was able to sit back and see how scientific Ally that could be a possibility and he had the great need to be an explainer he had to explain everything let me tell you what he meant let me explain to you let me explain that let me explain that and so that's what he was he the scriptures uh bears that out he said oh no no no no you surely won't die God said she would die well he wasn't lying if you had Eternal lifeu you always had eternal life but what he was telling her was God said if you P partake of this flesh that flesh will die right they wouldn't die yeah if they kept the flesh out of the picture God revealed it every act that God had in its mind would have come forth in an Purity a and a beauty that is not comprehendable in US it wouldn't have been driven by emotions and and hormones and is this too Frank no it wouldn't have been driven by carnality it would have been an aity of spiritual Divine uh that that I can't even comprehend because I'm stuck with this old glob of Flesh and dirt so so he he comes in and he say surely you you won't die well he knew the law of the seed everything had to bring forth of its what kind so what was God belonged to God right he would never get control of that come on so he he had to inject his seed right so he would have an offspring that could bring to pass his Eden right okay so now the messenger takes us through this because you understand the power to transform in our generation came by the word through the mouth of a prophet so let's hold that there because I'm just rehearsing to you what he said I played it Wednesday night I I advise you to go forth and listen to it if you did this will mean more to you this morning amen if you didn't please do so he's got to in interject something so he said oh surely you won't die let me come into this relationship with you and I will give you my seed right so now we know the story it goes on and he introduces it to Adam and Adam and Eve have this act that Satan had revealed her and she takes his seed and she brings forth what twins but two different what two different fathers that's right that's why Jesus could look out and he says you're of your father the devil if you would had known Moses you would have known me am amen he even asked Peter who do men say that I am some say you're this some say you're that he looks at Peter he said Flesh and Blood didn't this reveal to you but my Father which is in heaven revealed it to you this is what I'm going to build my church on God revealing who he is to his seed not to everybody some people don't even have anything in them to believe with oh I can see your mind spinning I I hope I get them spinning all right so we find out that we begin to look at the lineage right kan's a worker his father is so he starts tilling the land he starts selling he starts buying so he got this field and it produces so much food and so now he can sell that so he gets more land then he decides to build cities and civilizations and culture and education and science he's building everything up but here's this little lineage over here who's just Shepherds amen no matter how hard they try they just can't grip what can's seed is doing than you they can't they can't grip it they're from two different sources they have two different fathers do you understand that so Cain is Cain has one thing so God had an Eden right now if Abel would have come forth in the Garden of Eden he would have lived according to the laws of that seed okay but now Abel is now in a world because Satan is trying to do what build his own Eden because there's two Edens that's right that's right we are living in what Eden now we are living in Satan's Eden who is the God of this evil age knowledge science amen education that's their God everything's based on science everything's based on education what word is always left out faith faith Revelation let me say this as your brother you are not made to operate in Satan's [Music] Eden and the harder you try the bigger failure you will be God's children Hallelujah are the poor of this world but rich in what faith cuz I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me you are not Successful by education you are successful by Grace now King seed he's Successful by education he's Successful by science but we're only successful because God promised us we would not beg bread Hallelujah so everything you have is given to [Music] you so you can't compare and and why do we need all this drunk I'd like to know as much of the word of God as some people know about computers did you know that God's kingdom that's coming that you're going to doesn't have computers how am I going to email you Billy I need to have a Facebook when I get there so everybody to know where I'm at what I'm going through I I think Facebook book is the biggest self-pity party I've ever seen in my life I don't got one but it ain't going to be there no automobiles no jet planes none of that's going to be there you say well what happens if if I want to visit Billy well what me and Billy will do is we'll just create a world Hallelujah we'll travel in a thought and we'll visit there for however long long is because it's eternity I'm trying to build to something they're two different seeds now that brings up a big question in the people's minds because if it would have stayed in God's plan there would been a complete definite line of lineage that's right and you understand in type when God called out Israel he SP specifically said because he was planning to have a son right he wanted that lineage to be Abraham's lineage or if I could say from Isaac which was the son of what promise ishmail was the seed of what the Flesh of unbelief amen it was a seed of unbelief but there was a lawlu of the seed that every seed would bring forth of its kind so when Satan got connected with Eve that law of the seed still had to apply you understand so if you take a horse and breed it with a donkey the law of the seed has to apply amen but what comes out uh a mule yes right we call that what a hybrid the mixing of two two different species together so what did Man start to do the sons of God saw the daughters of man were what fair and they took to themselves wives what did they do they mixed now the seed of God remained in his mind from the beginning the mixing wasn't of the seed it was the mixing was in the [Music] flesh right that's why you could come down through life and you have an unbelieving father or some of you have uh because of the where you come from your father might have five or six wives and you got cousins and you maybe didn't know your father or didn't know your mother or whatever the circumstance might be that doesn't affect Hallelujah the Eternal seed of God it's still got to bring forth of its [Music] kind so what took place was highb breeding yes sir or high bird and so and we know that's a mixture of two different kinds of species and and uh uh it it causes all kinds of uh all kinds of different stuff but none of it's original it was all deformed so all all of a sudden you come into the world what speaking lies borned in sin shaped in iniquity why because you come in the lineage right of the fleshly act of that seed now there's got to be a way for God to identify his own because we're all a hybrid mess is that would you agree with me on that uh without going into great uh a great uh uh the things that we know that we are living in Satan's Eden and it is a what a mess no longer wishing to retain God in their knowledge they gave themselves over God gave them over to a reprobate mind in the beginning God made them male and female there's a difference between man and woman but because of the Hing because of the mixing of knowledge and Science and education and civilization man has moved farther and farther and farther away from God so much now that they don't want to retain God in their knowledge anymore you cannot believe some of the statements that are coming out of the mouths of new casters these days directly saying these people that read that fictional book called The Bible quote it's the Christian extremists that are causing all the trouble in our country today what do you call that seed sewing now there's only one kind of seed that can receive that because every seed brings forth of its kind that's the seed of unbelief and it's coming on them and they're beginning to hear these things and hear these statements and then they're looking out and they're saying oh that's true that's true so much cuz Satan's cated him in what religion having a form of Godly but denying the power thereof all kinds of man-made forms of worship all kinds of new moral codes oh we'll allow woman preachers the word of God saids she couldn't handle the word of God the word of God says let her remain silent at home if she has a question ask her husband maybe some of you wives don't think your husband's spiritual enough start asking him really good hard religious questions you just might make him get in the Bible now he might say woman be quiet and stay in your place but I'll guarantee you you planted the seed it's starting to work in them you ought to have that answer the scripture says be ready for every man to give an answer hallu hallu why don't we do this why don't we do that it's your house you're the pastor that's right apply the token I was going to say kick him out but you can't you can't you can't do that so we have this great hybrid a mess that they're trying to say men can be girls and girls can be men and you don't need this you don't need that how many understand that we're in perilous times perilous times they try to come up with diseases and they create more they've gathered billions and billions ions of dollars for cancer research you know why they'll never kill CA cure cancer because it's a spirit all they know to do is that life right begins to deform cells how many knows that Satan's a deformer and now that deformed Life starts to grow so all they figured out they can do is we'll poison it will kill all the cells that that life lives in and maybe it'll leave I say poison it or I can shoot it with radiation and maybe kill it I say shoot it with radiation I don't care how you kill Satan I hate Satan he needs to die he needs to be poisoned he needs to be radiated in fact he needs to get thrown in the Lake of Fire where he will be no more I don't care but I tell you one thing I sure had a lot of faith amen amen i' make the spiritual claim this is my body God gave me this body this body was created by God to fulfill his word and I am going to stand against that life I am going to pray until God gives me the Revelation that that Spirit has no more place to remain go to doctors but the scripture says they heard the words of God but being not mixed with faith it profited them nothing how many efforts are you putting forth in education in the workplace and everything not mixing it with faith it will not profit you nothing now it'll profit the other seed right that's right but you've got to live by faith the seed of God Lives by faith The Whole World's corrupt in hybrid born in sin shaped in iniquity come into the world speaking lies here clever come up here for a second let me read your notes see if you're on the same page I I can't read it so here's clever he's born in sin shaped in iniquity come in the world speaking lies does he have a chance he can't even know God he can't comprehend God all he's got is a mind and everybody can feed his mind and he can make intellectual what decisions some people make an intellectual decision about religion and they serve God intellectually the best way we they can you know what I say to that praise God I am not against intellectual religion if it'll make you act right do right yeah live right and be kind to others it's a good thing that's right you will come into judgment that's right for that boy some of you haven't thought on the word of God for a long time these are ABCs we're just too too caught up in accepting the world the way the world is so this guy don't have a chance so God does something before the foundation of the world he put a seed in here now the same law of the seed that is working in can seed come on now we don't know where that seed is now right because the lineage has been what hybrid it's been mixed is that right but God never lost his lineage he never lost what was in his mind he never lost the word of God and who was his my sheep know my voice another will not follow all the father hath given me will come he came for his own and his own received a not that wasn't just for Israel that's right that's right that was for all God seeds both Jew and Gentile so God's got to do something he this guy don't have a chance how are you going to get to God the only thing you can get to God with is your intellect and that's going to come up with your own understanding of what God is right the message or anything so he secured you Hallelujah eternally by writing your name on The Book of Life so he identified the name that was on the book with a seed that's right that's right now that seed just happened to fall into this heart or soul that came in the form of clever that's right amen born in sin shaped in iniquity you never told a lie in your life right confession is good for the soul I've told many but none of that was going to be laid to his charge why cuz the seed of God remains in them and that seed has a law it will bring forth of its kind so he has the seed so now God's got to bring that seed to life or germinate that seed so when the spirit of the word the spirit meets the spirit of the seed what is the spirit of the seed it's the intention for which the seed was planted if you plant a seed in a corn field and it brings forth the plum it's not the ground's fault that's right you planted the what the wrong seed so God's got to bring that to life he's got the power to transform it so he takes the spirit of the word amen not the Bible hallu everybody's got an interpretation of the Bible but the pure Hallelujah Divine Purpose amen for what the scriptures were given that's why the prophet says it says exactly what it means and God will interpret it by what bringing it to pass you say I don't understand anything read the scripture little ones believe what it says and let God do the rest so now this seed's in there so he is going to bring that seed to life he's got to germinate it so it's not the rain that's right that's right cuz the weeds are jumping up and down but the weed will never produce the wheat right it won't do it some of the wheat comes up and gets deformed some of it comes up and gets things but that true pure word that he have he takes the spirit of the seed and then the spirit of the word and I I had that quote SM but I I I can't read it to you it's in there he says when these things meet they will produce what it was planted for okay you're a clever fella clever it will it will produce so if you could just put this uh just put this paragraph up there paragraph 91 from the God's power to transform and then we'll also want to put up paragraph 98 because I I want to I want to uh give you okay Billy come here and read this out loud now he has his kind of an of an Eden Satan does now in these 6,000 years okay he had his kind where in Eden Satan does now in these 6,000 years he has formed not created but deformed God's whole earth his is create is creatures the animals inhib uh interbreeding hybriding trees plant human even what humans humans even to religion the B the Bible the church until he has got himself a complete Garden of Eden of science everything moving by science our automobiles everything that we have was given to us by science what man has done he has got his great Eden here to prove the message is timely his message is timely wait a second why is that important cuz it's the message that's going to germinate you that's right word and word bring forth life there's only one way he can get you to bring forth of its kind he had to send the word you were borned by the word in the beginning you must come to life by the word because you're word seed Hallelujah you're not Satan seed converted the only part that's hybrid is your flesh and that's why he's got to do away with it if you were to get the same body back what would happen to it it would die again how many knows brother Ram said that okay to prove the message is timely to prove that it's not some other age but Revelation 10 look at the hybriding today to make a better or prettier not a better look at little children today just look at them you know brother BR goes on to talk about his daughter going to the dentist and her teeth were starting to twist he said another one's coming bucked out then you know what he says he says the time will come where the teeth will will be growing all over the place I think Brianna just had to get a tooth that was growing up in her pallet pulled down to her gum there's been other people who have had that right it it it's what it is so what have they done all this High breeding you know what he said it was it's the food yes they've hbr everything they've hbr our flesh how many heard him say humans okay so you know that wasn't me making any of this up right it it would you at least give me credit for saying what he said so it it it's producing all this stuff now come read this next quote I'm trying to build your faith this morning amen is that you already read that one okay read this one paragraph 98 and99 now notice today hybriding cattles hybriding plants and science comes right back around the same science that does it says that's what's destroying the whole human race you read it in the you read it the same as I do well why don't we stop it it's because that they can't stop it God's word has said it would be that way but if you would think for a minute they are the instrument as Judah is scariot placing exactly the things that God said would happen amen it's doing it exactly on their own basis of Science by his science research in the same pattern he deceived Eve he he also has deceived the church which there which there Eve was a type now now Adam a type there again or Eve rather of the church notice what he did through the one wondering of for knowledge she slipped across the line between right and wrong by listening of by listen listening to Satan's perversion or deform deformity of the original word of God am amen what who did he hybrid the church you understand we're victims because God said it would be this way I'm I'm closing but what did he just say if you would think if you would stop and think what is the only thing we need the word of God he promised I will not see the righteous beg bread I will not leave you nor forsake you now I want to draw a picture here just morning cuz I want us to rise up in faith I don't want to pursue a movement I don't want to pursue an excitement I I preached here a while back laid it out just straight out of the message about the false Revival how do you identify a false Revival find out yes if they're associated with playing the tapes preaching the word of God living right I know we people react people say play tapes only and I believe in playing the tapes I believe in listening to the tapes and I hear the prophet of God say stay with the tape now if I just take that stay with the tapes then I can say tape only and I am doing that but he also came over here and he said preach the word of God Amen and the word's not delivered by a mechanical advice so so what is it you can hybrid it by taking this and then you take all that he said that's right you search the the word of God the scriptures for in them you'll have eternal life and if you're seed they they they speak of of of him so we we we see that all this is here because the message is timely we we see here exactly what he was said they can't discern the right and wrong so I want to take you back just for a moment okay because we're all in this Eden right Satan has found a way to attach his Hybrid part of us which is the flesh that makes sense to you okay the seed isn't the seed remains in me right but this was born in what s sin and shaped in iniquity and came into the world speaking lies so what has he promised me a new one oh happy day when Jesus comes to take away Hallelujah that makes me want to shout a new body I haven't lost a one oh Glorious Day even so come quickly Lord Jesus look up your Redemption draws nigh but in the beginning he made a statement when Eve was defiled by Satan he never defiled God's seed that's right right Adam went out by his own choice because he had the characteristic of Christ and he had to redeem his wife he took her he's could take care of her now I don't care if you don't like your wife you married her you provide for her you don't run off and get yourself another one that's right very few circumstances in which you can do something like that so when that when God found them in that condition he said statement he said I will put enity between thy seed and the serpent seed now there was going to be an enity how many knows the definition of emnity very few people it means this here is the the definition of uh enity in uh in the the Bible or or the definition emni is the state of feeling a state of feeling uh actively opposing yes our he says it it says here he says emnity is the state of feeling actively opposed or hostile toward someone or something now so what he said was I am going to put an active opposition and hostility between the seeds Oh you mean well I just read it this whole perversion and everything is for one purpose it's against the word of God Satan has never stopped from day one trying to discredit the word of God surely you won't die yeah that was a half truth but he gave gain control of an Eden now this whole Eden this whole science this whole education this whole civilization the Democratic party the Republican Party The noname Party The libertarian party the Communist Party the e pasta on Tuesday party all of them are against you they're opposed to you amen you understand civilization and education is opposed to you rising up and becoming the Vindicated seed of God that you are meant to be it's opposition it ain't an idea of us living right in this world how can you live right in something you're not a part of the whole thing's against you why invite it why look for it to give you some sort of vindication or some dat a boy or some you're doing good we don't measure spirituality by Prosperity the more prosperous you are the harder it is for you to make it cuz the less you have to use Faith didn't Roger testify my uncle's leaving his faith you say a prayer and the kids get well and three hours hallelujah what would he done if he would have said put the phone now listen to me close go down and get some flowex and some vitamin C and mix that with vitamin D and then go get some aloe vera or take some oregano and put it on your tongue that'll make you want to get well you understand every bit of that is opposed to the what original word of God Amen ask what you will in my name and the father will give it to you the whole thing's against us it's opposed to us and it's actively hostile and it will get more hostile be not dismayed at the fiery darts of the enemy and the what trying of your Faith we're letting this world get us out of balance we're letting the opposition affect us we're letting the hostility of the world try to push us under cover faith is the victory Satan tempts your faith you have a problem in the in the flesh don't try to solve it by the flesh that that whole flesh you got is the hybrid of the seeds the human hybrid produce this thing that's susceptible to music have you ever been in a restaurant and they put on some music and your kids never heard it in your house or nothing they're going is that what you taught them when there's no Believers along you know what I mean do you have the you know do you have the latest country music blaring at your house you know and your boot scooting across the kitchen you know what I mean where did they get it from they came into the world what speaking light born in sin shaped in iniquity that that world is still trying to claim it because it's going to claim all of its own that's right but you little flock are not of this world you are in this world but you are not of this world if I could read it I would read it to you the prophet of God said oh when then we can believe that and understand that what do you do to the devil you resist the devil and he will flee you don't make a pack with the devil we do not negotiate with terrorists amen and Satan is the terrorist of your soul you don't make plans with them if you can't afford something you don't go make some credit card plan just telling you some people have got themselves in such a financial burden and bind that they're almost obligated to the terrorist Satan is the terrorist of your soul this world today Science Education civilization the hour that we're living in this wicked evil Eden is the enemy of your soul I know there's a scripture that refers to him as the enemy of my soul I think it's in Psalms think of it you don't have to give in to him no matter what circumstance he puts before you you do not have to give in to him he's given you a weapon what is the weapon the word of God if he could have given you anything better he would have given it to you he gave you the word you don't have to negotiate Satan tried to get Jesus to negotiate oh if you would do this if thou be prove it it's written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God wouldn't it' be great if we started standing up Thou shalt not tempt the HS of the king the seed of God the royal priesthood you have no right to put me in this situation you have no right to speak to my mind well you're going to fail you're going to be uh repossessed well that's what we need we need to be repossessed by the Holy Spirit and get rid of doubt the word of God is solid amen it created the heavens and earth surely it can recreate your situation or he can transform he's got the power to transform I I I put my eternal existence on that that he's got the power he's got the power to bring me out he's got the power to forgive me he's got the power to deliver me he's got the power to make my wrongs right Hallelujah I'm sitting in a whole world that's opposed to me it's actively against me and the word of God says we are not to mix the seeds there's those there's a law of the seed that everyone will bring forth of its kind your life will bring forth this word if that seeds in you amen and don't judge it by your flesh judge it by when you hear it do you say Amen David a seed of God the Prophet come to him he said there was a man that did this he take as a man he only had one sheep and and this man had many sheep and he went and took that one guy's sheep and slayed him David says who is he go slay that man and that Prophet looked at him and said you're that man what was David's response let me know what his response of let it be done unto me that judgment was truth amen I'm guilty I did it I'm ready to die but David had something in them wasn't it it was the seed of God and there was a blood sacrifice the only provided place that God meets the believer Hallelujah because that seed had to bring forth what the lineage the identifier of all that were his the word and the word came and those that were his received it gladly and then Paul not too long later he says there's there's there's Terrors amongst your Feast people saying I'm of this and people saying I'm of that spots in in your wrinkles it was already Jude finally wrote he said it's necessary for me to write to you of the common salvation this morning it's needful for me to remind you that you are the seed of God you do not have to make a deal with the devil you do not have to compromise what's he looking for today is uncompromising girls if you go to a public school you do not have to dress different for public school than you do for church you don't have to wear flats to church and high heels to school that's your enemy those high heels are are your enemy they're going to keep you and hold you back from becoming what you really can be why does anybody want want to present themselves to a bunch of unbelievers that won't even accept them for the character you know Martin Luther King made a statement that I really have always appreciated he says I long for the day where a man is judged by his character and not the color of his skin wouldn't that be something if we would start judging one another by our character not by our preaching style not by the color of our skin not by where we came from but we would judge one another by the word of God Amen so you see what we're what I'm trying to tell you this morning I'm wanting to lift your faith I want you to know you are different you're the children of God you will never fit you are a round peg in a square hole or if you want to be the square then round whatever you're not you are Sons and Daughters of God the word of God speaks to the inward man the carnal mind is Emy with God but the spirit ual mind is life and peace so when you walk out there I want you looked at the cars going down the street the airplanes in the sky and realize this never was my home I never was meant to communicate by the internet God's got another world for me he's got another life for me and he's given me the earnest of that life Hallelujah by quickening Me by his word his Spirit quickening the word seed that's in me quickening it by the spirit of his word which the spirit of the word in this day was spoken by Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 I am not going to walk with my enemy how can two walk together unless they agree and then you all of a sudden you find yourself in this great pressure what am I going to do I've already made all these mistakes and I'm in this mess the Banker's not the answer George Washington Abraham Lincoln Jefferson Grant Benjamin Franklin I

it one more time it's not you it's not you it's the emnity it's the seed of the serpent it's the seed of the world it's his Eden his Eden is opposed to you and if they can't convert you to it they may imprison you but it's not a time to be playing around it's a time to get into your Bibles to get into your messages to get into service to serve God it's a time to testify to your loved ones to testify to every part of the world that you can testify in the Satan is like a roaring line going about seeking whom he may devour aren't you glad he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life aren't
