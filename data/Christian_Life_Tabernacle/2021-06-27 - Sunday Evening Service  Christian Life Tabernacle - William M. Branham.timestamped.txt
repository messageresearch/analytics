[36:06] not omnipotent
[36:08] he's not omniscient
[36:12] he can't be plaguing us all at the same
[36:13] time he's got his imps and his angels
[36:17] but the lord they're defeated so may we
[36:20] go from here lord of victorious people

[37:11] god bless you i was just thinking of the
[37:15] song
[37:15] and the message this morning about how
[37:20] the easter seal is alive in us and
[37:23] and i thought god's power is alive is
[37:25] definitely a great testimony about that
[37:28] so
[37:28] i'll be singing about that today
[37:35] people say that our god's dead
[37:39] has no power or might
[37:44] they deny that is living
[37:50] think this faith is alive
[37:55] we can't help that they say this
[38:00] for they do not understand
[38:05] they wonder and reason
[38:10] think jesus was just a man
[38:15] what about the truth
[38:20] what about the light
[38:23] [Music]
[38:25] what about the message

[38:49] god's power is alive
[38:54] there's no purpose in leaving
[38:59] god's voice in this day
[39:04] don't cling to reason
[39:09] and the world's filthy ways
[39:15] we have a vision
[39:19] and no power can hold us back
[39:24] just stay faithful in jesus
[39:29] and he'll keep you on track
[39:33] so i ask you what about the truth
[39:47] [Music]
[39:54] is goodness
[39:58] what is done in your life

[45:53] bound and in prison
[45:56] [Music]
[45:58] father they had no look past death
[46:02] but one day you came and opened the tomb
[46:06] father and you paid the price
[46:11] and you made a way for all of us to be
[46:14] resurrected
[46:16] and to return back to from whence we
[46:18] came
[46:19] back to eden oh lord that thrills our
[46:22] heart
[46:23] we just ask you to bless us again
[46:25] tonight
[46:26] as we fellowship around your word in
[46:29] jesus
[46:30] precious and wonderful name
[46:33] we pray amen
[46:36] amen let's open our bibles and just read
[46:38] that
[46:39] verse that our messenger used this
[46:43] morning
[46:44] and it
[46:48] found there in
[46:52] romans the 8th chapter and the 11th
[46:55] verse
[46:57] and
[47:03] the one that we we know uh
[47:06] so well it's it's in my message book
[47:09] here but
[47:10] i i like to read it out of the bible so
[47:13] um it's good so
[47:19] and let's so let's read this romans uh
[47:22] the 8th chapter
[47:23] in the 11th verse but if the spirit
[47:26] of him that raised up
[47:30] jesus from the dead dwell
[47:33] in you he that raised christ
[47:37] from the dead shall also quicken
[47:41] your mortal bodies by his spirit
[47:44] that dwelleth in you
[47:48] father we ask you to bless your word to
[47:50] us in your precious name we pray
[47:52] amen you may be seated tonight we're
[47:55] going to
[47:56] continue with 16
[47:59] more minutes of the message that we're
[48:03] studying and uh
[48:07] it just it's beautiful and we'll just
[48:11] enjoy these great things you know i i
[48:14] thought how beautiful that
[48:17] romans 11 ties in to melchizedek
[48:22] and who he was and when how he says we
[48:25] no longer
[48:26] hear of melchizedek because he became
[48:30] jesus christ and now we see that that
[48:33] god was now veiled
[48:36] in that that's the scripture says he
[48:39] prepared a body for himself
[48:42] and and and it's just beautiful when we
[48:44] see that
[48:45] but we just we just started our message
[48:48] this morning
[48:49] and there's just several beautiful
[48:52] statements that
[48:53] brother bannon makes we just want to
[48:56] mention them
[48:58] to us as
[49:01] as we before we go forward and and
[49:04] you know someone mentioned to me at
[49:05] lunch today they said that first part of
[49:08] the message you
[49:09] played has so many uh what they call
[49:13] one liners you know where just
[49:16] statements that
[49:17] just stand alone out just one after the
[49:21] other
[49:21] and and i thought is this one of them
[49:24] that we read this morning
[49:26] he said to me that's the real seal of it
[49:30] when something is said and then
[49:34] it's turned around and proven
[49:37] so anybody can make a confession
[49:40] but when you bring it to pass then that
[49:43] just puts the
[49:45] seal right there on it
[49:48] and then i thought this was a
[49:51] another thing how
[49:54] brother branham will go through the
[49:57] scriptures as he's preaching
[49:59] and he will give a definition for
[50:03] something
[50:04] that when you go back and read it it
[50:07] makes that scriptures come so alive and
[50:10] we all know the scripture matthew ye are
[50:12] the salt of the earth
[50:14] and if the salt loses its savor
[50:17] then what good is it but to be cast out
[50:21] and and then so we get the definition of
[50:24] salt
[50:25] and it makes that scripture just stand
[50:27] out
[50:28] so much more to us and he says he says
[50:31] the world is
[50:32] looking for this salt and
[50:37] he says for this salt and when
[50:40] we can prove by our lives
[50:45] and by the bible that our lives
[50:48] are vindicating that word
[50:52] to be living today
[50:55] that's the day we're looking for
[50:58] so there's two great things is that
[51:00] we're looking for a day
[51:02] that there's a quickening power
[51:04] delivered to us
[51:06] that we can make every promise in this
[51:09] bible live
[51:10] now i believe we're in that time of
[51:12] transition into that
[51:14] because we believe every promise we've
[51:17] settled that question
[51:18] in our hearts and minds we know this
[51:20] message is true
[51:21] but now we realize that it's not we're
[51:24] not looking back on the message
[51:26] as something that's come and gone that
[51:29] we believe
[51:30] but we're understanding more and more
[51:33] that
[51:33] that the message was delivered through a
[51:35] prophet
[51:36] because it was prophecy and the word
[51:39] came
[51:39] to the prophet and the prophet was
[51:42] speaking
[51:43] i could almost use this terminology if
[51:46] you don't
[51:47] take it too far the other way but it was
[51:50] almost like he was speaking
[51:52] the bride into existence because the
[51:55] word
[51:56] was what quickened that bride and
[51:59] brought her
[52:00] to life and and and that bride was
[52:03] quickened by the spirit
[52:06] bringing that word to that hearer by
[52:09] revelation
[52:10] and so we're looking for that day and we
[52:13] just feel
[52:14] and then he goes on to talk here he says
[52:18] that we've come to this day he said
[52:21] that's the day
[52:22] we're looking for and it says and he's
[52:25] talking about the believer them who
[52:27] promised
[52:28] and say they believe he's given
[52:31] us a definite understanding of it
[52:36] just think of that this message has
[52:40] given us a definite
[52:41] understanding of it so there's a
[52:44] definite
[52:45] understanding if you have a question
[52:47] there is a definite
[52:49] understanding lying in god's word
[52:52] for you it's it's just these are just
[52:55] little statements that he made that i
[52:56] thought was
[52:57] a deafening understanding of it that
[53:00] these signs
[53:02] would follow them that believe it would
[53:05] be
[53:06] the proof of their testimony now we can
[53:09] say we believe
[53:11] but until we are until we
[53:14] are have the proven sign
[53:17] that he said that would be upon us
[53:20] then we are just confessing to be a
[53:23] believer
[53:23] and not a possession of believers
[53:27] so this is what we said that we have
[53:29] proof
[53:31] of of of the sign
[53:34] that he said would be upon us
[53:37] so i like that because i
[53:40] if he said it would be upon us then it's
[53:43] going to be upon us
[53:45] okay if i lack it i can look forward to
[53:48] it
[53:48] i can pray for it i can ask for god to
[53:52] manifest it someplace in my life to make
[53:55] it
[53:56] real to me so that's why i said
[54:00] the the word is never given to the
[54:02] hearer
[54:03] as condemnation that it it may approve
[54:07] you of sin
[54:08] or correct the sin in your life but
[54:11] but along with every chastisement
[54:14] there's a peace that follows
[54:16] because the believer is set free from
[54:19] that which is holding them down brother
[54:22] rem says correct
[54:23] does not mean to punish it means to
[54:26] change the path of the believer to make
[54:29] a
[54:30] navigation correction
[54:33] yeah you know so uh that is
[54:36] a wonderful thing so and i thought that
[54:40] was a wonderful statement
[54:42] and then we come over and we read
[54:44] another
[54:47] where he said we're going to break into
[54:49] this subject
[54:50] so that kind of lets me look forward to
[54:52] the
[54:53] rest of the book that we're going to
[54:55] break into something
[54:57] that the messenger certainly wants to
[54:59] bring out
[55:00] and kind of teach it for a few minutes
[55:04] how that we are quickened
[55:08] and can we be sure that it's the truth
[55:12] well we know what quickens right we know
[55:15] it's the spirit
[55:16] but the spirit only quickens the word so
[55:20] it's a marvelous thing and then he says
[55:23] he says now
[55:24] it's the spirit that quickens
[55:27] it's not the word that quickens so the
[55:30] word
[55:31] by by itself becomes what letter
[55:34] and it kill us a lot of people have got
[55:36] the scriptures
[55:38] and they've lined the scriptures up
[55:39] they've studied the scriptures they've
[55:41] put their
[55:42] ideas to the scriptures and and they've
[55:45] drawn a picture
[55:46] but as time changes then
[55:49] a lot of their their teaching has
[55:53] tried to change because they built their
[55:56] teaching
[55:57] on the historical events that were
[56:00] transpiring
[56:02] and you know back in world war one when
[56:04] they had the uh
[56:06] the the countries came together many
[56:09] people taught
[56:10] that that was the ten toes of daniel and
[56:13] and that this event was taking place and
[56:15] and
[56:16] they laid it all up i remember even in
[56:18] the day that
[56:19] we were living in when israel and the
[56:22] suez canal
[56:24] was closed and and and people placed
[56:27] that
[56:28] as a certain event taking place in
[56:31] history
[56:32] but history keeps changing but god's
[56:35] word
[56:35] never changes and so we understand that
[56:38] history doesn't interpret god's word
[56:41] god's word god interprets his own word
[56:44] by bringing it to pass so we understand
[56:48] that
[56:48] it's the spirit that quickens the word
[56:51] and so we don't have to search
[56:53] for a definition we don't have to search
[56:56] for a conclusion
[56:58] we can pray and lay before the lord and
[57:01] the spirit of god
[57:03] will bring us into remembrance of all
[57:05] things that he taught
[57:07] so he didn't leave us comfortless
[57:10] he said i'll come again to you i'll be
[57:12] with you even in you
[57:14] in other words i'll quicken the word to
[57:16] you the things that i taught
[57:18] i will bring to your remembrance i'll
[57:21] quicken him to
[57:22] you i'll make him alive and he says
[57:25] it's not the word that quickens it's the
[57:28] spirit that quickens the word
[57:30] now that's that's the only thing the
[57:33] spirit will
[57:34] quicken because it didn't come to speak
[57:37] of itself
[57:38] or to put a testimony of itself
[57:41] or or the point the spirit of god came
[57:44] to quicken
[57:45] the word to make it live to show you
[57:48] what he said
[57:49] to bring it to your remembrance that you
[57:52] know
[57:54] that's why this bible becomes such a
[57:57] wonderful book
[57:58] and as you grow in the word of god i
[58:00] know when you first
[58:02] when we first enter into the message we
[58:04] have
[58:05] a lot of of understanding and teachings
[58:08] and definitions that were laid down for
[58:12] us there are certain words
[58:14] like rapture that i had a certain idea
[58:17] in my mind
[58:18] what it meant because people shared that
[58:20] with me so
[58:21] much what evidences were but so when i
[58:25] heard the message it i i knew i could
[58:28] feel like the
[58:28] sense it but i still couldn't go back
[58:31] and as the more i
[58:32] saw the understanding the more that this
[58:36] word begin to to come alive to me
[58:40] and fit together and it always marveled
[58:43] me how our messenger would say so many
[58:45] times
[58:46] he would say go back and read it again
[58:48] and see if that's not
[58:51] what it says and well this only person
[58:54] that can do that
[58:55] is the spirit giving you eyes out and
[58:58] quick and you
[59:00] that that that's what it said and and we
[59:02] just grow
[59:03] into this message he says now he says
[59:07] it quickens it's the spirit that
[59:09] quickens the word
[59:11] or gives the word life
[59:14] gives it wings to fly gives it
[59:18] access now i like that i'd like to just
[59:22] preach a whole
[59:23] sermon right there on the access of the
[59:26] spirit
[59:27] in other words the spirit comes down
[59:29] makes that word of life
[59:31] and now that word can go into your
[59:33] circumstance
[59:34] it now has access to your circumstance
[59:38] it now has
[59:39] access to your problem it no longer
[59:42] no longer can anything block it when you
[59:46] have access to something you know these
[59:48] access codes
[59:50] that they have you know and you walk up
[59:52] to them and you can't see the numbers
[59:54] so there's only four numbers that you
[59:57] can't read
[59:58] well you know if you can get those four
[1:00:00] numbers in the right order you have
[1:00:01] access
[1:00:04] you know that's why they change those
[1:00:07] numbers
[1:00:08] all the time but we were heard that the
[1:00:11] spirit
[1:00:12] is what gives us access it gives us
[1:00:15] access to the promise
[1:00:17] it quickens the promise to us makes that
[1:00:20] word alive
[1:00:21] and now we have the the the uh
[1:00:25] backing the filling the leadership of
[1:00:27] the spirit
[1:00:28] to go take that promise and apply it
[1:00:32] to the circumstance oh it just it
[1:00:35] changes things for it
[1:00:37] you know it you might have the word like
[1:00:40] he goes on and says you might
[1:00:42] you might uh believe it
[1:00:46] but until it's made alive
[1:00:49] and quickened to you then it's something
[1:00:52] you believe
[1:00:53] and it's not something you possess it's
[1:00:56] like me
[1:00:56] looking at a job and saying i need a
[1:00:59] phillips screwdriver
[1:01:01] have you ever needed a phillips
[1:01:02] screwdriver and the only thing you can
[1:01:04] find
[1:01:04] is a flathead
[1:01:08] so you go out and get a bunch of
[1:01:10] flathead screwdrivers you know what i
[1:01:12] mean
[1:01:13] our phillips screwdrivers and pretty
[1:01:15] soon
[1:01:16] you know it turns just the other way
[1:01:19] around
[1:01:19] you got a bunch of phillips and you know
[1:01:22] and it just thing well that's kind of
[1:01:24] like
[1:01:25] what it is if you believe something but
[1:01:27] you can't make it work
[1:01:30] you know you know what you need but you
[1:01:32] don't have the tool
[1:01:34] well this the spirit quickens the tool
[1:01:38] it becomes the tool for what you need
[1:01:42] and so the letter without it is dead
[1:01:44] it's intellectual but once the spirit's
[1:01:47] there
[1:01:47] quickens and makes it alive it can then
[1:01:50] it
[1:01:50] gives access it's the spirit that does
[1:01:54] that the spirit that gives you access
[1:01:56] and gives the word
[1:01:58] access amen allows the word to come into
[1:02:02] your life
[1:02:03] and doing you what it promised to do
[1:02:07] and and i like that because i need a lot
[1:02:09] of work
[1:02:11] you know what i mean i mean he's still
[1:02:13] working on me
[1:02:15] you know because i'm not what i want to
[1:02:17] be and i'm
[1:02:18] not what i ought to be but i know i'm
[1:02:21] not what i used to be
[1:02:22] so i know the path that i've taken
[1:02:26] from where i was when i started this
[1:02:29] journey
[1:02:30] that i'm not the same of course as the
[1:02:32] farther i go down
[1:02:34] this journey the more baggage i realize
[1:02:37] i'm carrying with me the cares i'm
[1:02:40] carrying with me the fears that i'm
[1:02:42] carrying with me
[1:02:43] that i don't need to carry you know i
[1:02:45] mean he's got me thus far he'll take me
[1:02:48] all the way through
[1:02:49] that's a that's a promise and and you
[1:02:52] know
[1:02:52] as you get closer and and
[1:02:55] you retire you know there was a a time i
[1:02:58] felt well i've got some
[1:03:00] a a little bit of money in a ira
[1:03:03] i i took comfort that i had that there
[1:03:06] and because it was there you know i
[1:03:08] couldn't touch it but at least i knew it
[1:03:10] was there
[1:03:11] and then i get a letter that i've got to
[1:03:14] take it all out
[1:03:16] i said i'm that old that i got to take
[1:03:18] it all out
[1:03:20] and they said yeah you've got to take
[1:03:21] this out and i says then what do i do
[1:03:23] with it
[1:03:23] you go pay taxes on it so i don't have
[1:03:26] as much as i had before
[1:03:28] you know i'm just talking a few thousand
[1:03:30] dollars but and nevertheless
[1:03:32] you know you don't really want to give
[1:03:34] any of it away for nothing
[1:03:36] and and sure enough and all of a sudden
[1:03:39] i got to thinking said you know
[1:03:41] really what was that doing for me it was
[1:03:43] giving me
[1:03:44] a false sense of security
[1:03:48] you know i wonder how many people have a
[1:03:50] false sense of security in the medical
[1:03:52] world or
[1:03:53] false insecurity in our government or
[1:03:56] a false sense of security in even
[1:03:59] society itself that that you know that
[1:04:03] they'll say peace and safety but all of
[1:04:05] a sudden sudden destruction comes
[1:04:07] we're only safe in one thing and that's
[1:04:11] in the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:04:13] that's where we're safe that he promised
[1:04:16] us that he would never leave us
[1:04:18] nor forsake us nothing would pluck us
[1:04:20] out of the palm of his hand
[1:04:22] that no matter how dark it gets he
[1:04:24] promised that his elect lady
[1:04:26] would not go through that tribulation
[1:04:30] and so that gives us a great
[1:04:33] a great uh comfort in those things and
[1:04:37] then he said this
[1:04:39] he says look at the millions on earth
[1:04:42] that didn't
[1:04:43] this is paragraph 60 i probably should
[1:04:45] be giving you the paragraphs but
[1:04:48] look at the millions on earth that
[1:04:50] didn't receive it
[1:04:51] when jesus was here but how thankful
[1:04:55] that we should be this morning
[1:05:00] now this it i think that's real
[1:05:02] important to god
[1:05:04] that we're thankful you know
[1:05:08] how thankful we are to have heard this
[1:05:11] message
[1:05:12] i i know each one of us has a different
[1:05:16] way that we hear it a different way that
[1:05:19] we follow it
[1:05:20] a different way we believe it it it's an
[1:05:23] individual affair and and
[1:05:27] there's certain basic truths that we can
[1:05:29] communicate upon
[1:05:31] but that part of it that's in your heart
[1:05:34] is personal
[1:05:35] you know it's a personal revelation and
[1:05:39] and and we're thankful how thankful we
[1:05:41] should be
[1:05:42] this morning to know that we have
[1:05:46] the direct evidence and the bible
[1:05:50] proof that we are included
[1:05:54] in that great resurrection morning
[1:05:56] coming
[1:05:59] oh that's what we want to make sure
[1:06:02] everybody has is that great
[1:06:06] proof that that thankful for direct
[1:06:10] evidence in other words not secondary
[1:06:12] evidence
[1:06:14] not a note from brother david that
[1:06:16] saying you're going in the rapture
[1:06:18] i'm sure of it you know but you have
[1:06:21] direct evidence
[1:06:22] personal evidence in your life that
[1:06:25] that resurrection life uh spoken of in
[1:06:28] romans
[1:06:29] is living in you he says
[1:06:33] that great easter and we have the
[1:06:37] earnest of it
[1:06:38] right now in our mortal bodies
[1:06:41] the the predestinated ones are the first
[1:06:45] of course to be quickened when the holy
[1:06:49] spirit
[1:06:49] comes to claim
[1:06:52] its own now did that catch anybody
[1:06:55] else's attention
[1:06:57] i mean it just i i just stopped
[1:07:00] in my tracks because he said
[1:07:05] the predestinated ones are the first
[1:07:09] of course to be quickened
[1:07:13] now i wonder
[1:07:16] i'm not saying i have an answer for this
[1:07:19] but it looks like that there's a space
[1:07:22] of
[1:07:22] grace or an allotment
[1:07:26] for some to be
[1:07:29] there you know what i mean that there
[1:07:32] may be
[1:07:33] others that follow that are quickened i
[1:07:36] don't know whether they come out of the
[1:07:37] millennium
[1:07:38] i don't know whether god takes his own
[1:07:41] and then he looks and he sees people
[1:07:43] that love them
[1:07:45] and that you love and his grace makes a
[1:07:48] way for them
[1:07:49] but that'll that that gave me great rest
[1:07:53] you know who if there's a first
[1:07:57] then it it you understand that
[1:08:02] no i would have expected him to say
[1:08:06] the only ones that are going to be
[1:08:09] quickened
[1:08:10] are the predestinated and i just believe
[1:08:14] um this is me personally speaking i
[1:08:17] don't believe that brother branham made
[1:08:19] random statements that didn't have no
[1:08:21] meaning
[1:08:26] you know i i don't know by grace if he
[1:08:29] was making a way or
[1:08:31] he maybe there was people there that
[1:08:33] were just
[1:08:34] they just god didn't open their eyes
[1:08:36] they couldn't see it but they'd done so
[1:08:38] much to help him
[1:08:40] you know i think so many of the full
[1:08:42] gospel businessmen that
[1:08:43] gave the opportunity for brother branham
[1:08:45] to open
[1:08:46] the door for him this was at that
[1:08:48] breakfast but i thought that was a
[1:08:50] pretty outstanding statement
[1:08:52] you know that really caught my eye he
[1:08:55] says the predested
[1:08:57] ones are the first of course
[1:09:01] to be quickened when the holy spirit
[1:09:03] comes to claim
[1:09:05] his own i thought that was a tremendous
[1:09:08] statement and then up here he goes on to
[1:09:11] explain
[1:09:11] and he says in paragraph 61 he makes
[1:09:14] this statement
[1:09:15] his great plan begin to unfold
[1:09:20] and isn't that what really our messenger
[1:09:22] has been showing us
[1:09:23] is the great plan of god unfolding
[1:09:27] and then this is another great statement
[1:09:29] he makes in
[1:09:31] paragraph 63. we won't read the whole
[1:09:34] thing he says it's the foreknowledge
[1:09:37] of god taking place god's
[1:09:40] word and uh so that's what we're just
[1:09:44] really
[1:09:45] resting heavy on as we begin to watch
[1:09:49] this easter seal unfold i believe as the
[1:09:52] lord unfolds it to us
[1:09:54] but that work it's the foreknowledge
[1:09:57] of god taking place
[1:10:01] that's what the word of god is it's the
[1:10:03] foreknowledge of god
[1:10:05] taking place so he said you sitting here
[1:10:08] tonight
[1:10:09] right where you are everything is
[1:10:11] pre-planned
[1:10:12] by god he knew it he knew it by poor
[1:10:15] knowledge
[1:10:16] and now the foreknowledge of god is
[1:10:18] taking place and we talked that in
[1:10:21] questions and answers
[1:10:22] last sunday about how the fullness
[1:10:26] how what the fullness of god was because
[1:10:29] everything that was made was made by him
[1:10:32] and there's nothing that was made that
[1:10:35] was not
[1:10:36] made by him so that
[1:10:39] everything came from him so he knows it
[1:10:41] all knows when it would be here how it
[1:10:43] would be here
[1:10:44] what it looked like and that's why you
[1:10:46] said the color of your hair the color of
[1:10:48] your eyes
[1:10:48] color of your skin the stature you're in
[1:10:50] every bit of you
[1:10:51] he knew before the foundation of the
[1:10:53] world and he knew you'd be sitting here
[1:10:57] that's pretty comforting
[1:11:00] unless of course you're not living right
[1:11:02] and then that puts you under a lot of
[1:11:04] conviction
[1:11:06] because if he knew you would be here
[1:11:08] then he knows what you're doing
[1:11:11] okay and that's the time you stop
[1:11:15] and ask for help there's nothing ahead
[1:11:19] lord you know how i'm going through you
[1:11:21] know what's my battle and my mind is
[1:11:23] you know the battle in my flesh you know
[1:11:27] where i'm at i i can't hide it from you
[1:11:30] but you can help me and
[1:11:33] that's what our messenger said about the
[1:11:35] woman at the well
[1:11:37] he said that i'm not the woman at the
[1:11:39] well the woman that washed jesus feet
[1:11:41] when she went and sold and bought the
[1:11:44] the appointment the prophet god said she
[1:11:48] stood there and she said look at him
[1:11:50] sitting there with dirty feet and so she
[1:11:52] ran
[1:11:55] he said and cut the oil and come back
[1:11:58] but when she got back he was still at
[1:12:01] the feast when she got back nobody had
[1:12:03] washed his feet
[1:12:05] and she she wanted to go but then the
[1:12:08] mind battle started
[1:12:10] and he said she wanted to go but she
[1:12:14] knew he knew
[1:12:18] where she had got the money
[1:12:24] okay so she knew he knew
[1:12:28] okay so the fear of rejection was there
[1:12:33] do you know he said all ye that are
[1:12:34] heavy laden come unto you
[1:12:36] and i'll give you rest and no wise
[1:12:40] will i cast you away or cast you out
[1:12:44] so she sat right there she knew all
[1:12:46] those things were going on
[1:12:48] and the prophet of god said but she knew
[1:12:51] he was the
[1:12:52] only one that could help her
[1:12:59] i i can you imagine coming up
[1:13:03] at walking into that presence as you
[1:13:05] know a
[1:13:06] messenger would say you know that
[1:13:09] warm feeling that you're feeling right
[1:13:11] here that's him
[1:13:13] or he'd say he's right over you now you
[1:13:16] can
[1:13:16] feel that presence on you and then he'd
[1:13:20] let you know there's no secrets that
[1:13:22] you know and he would knew but yet he'd
[1:13:25] stand there and the meanest man
[1:13:27] in town would come and he'd still have
[1:13:29] that tender mercy
[1:13:31] and that spirit and that forgiveness and
[1:13:34] offer him
[1:13:35] everything that he purchased at calvary
[1:13:38] healing
[1:13:39] deliverance discernment all the things
[1:13:42] that he purchased
[1:13:43] he would offer them
[1:13:46] for them and and yet having complete
[1:13:51] knowledge of of those things i just
[1:13:54] think that's
[1:13:55] that that's so beautiful and then as we
[1:13:59] read here he said in the 65th
[1:14:02] verse he said this is right
[1:14:06] it's the holy spirit seeking you out
[1:14:10] let me read this he says o wayward man
[1:14:12] or woman
[1:14:13] this morning when you're sitting here
[1:14:16] and there's something in you
[1:14:20] telling you this is right
[1:14:23] and remember we just read that where he
[1:14:24] talked it's not something you could put
[1:14:26] in it's not something you could do
[1:14:28] but he's telling them there's something
[1:14:29] in you telling you
[1:14:31] that this is right it's the holy spirit
[1:14:34] seeking you out to bring you to a
[1:14:37] knowledge of the truth of this hour
[1:14:41] that we're now living not some hour
[1:14:44] that's gone by but the hour
[1:14:48] now and
[1:14:51] just think of that i i my own personal
[1:14:54] way
[1:14:55] i take this word and i tie it
[1:14:58] up to the other one it's the
[1:15:00] foreknowledge of god
[1:15:01] taking place this is right
[1:15:04] it's the holy spirit seeking you out to
[1:15:07] bring you to the foreknowledge
[1:15:11] to what god had in mind of you
[1:15:15] to be and that's what the holy spirit
[1:15:17] still does
[1:15:18] you can believe this and live it but if
[1:15:20] there's some place that god wants you to
[1:15:22] be in your life
[1:15:24] some character some work that he has for
[1:15:27] you to do
[1:15:28] some way for you to please and serve him
[1:15:31] that spirit will keep working on you and
[1:15:34] calling you
[1:15:35] to bring you to that place amen he will
[1:15:39] not
[1:15:39] leave you nor forsake you he'll forgive
[1:15:42] you of all
[1:15:43] unrighteousness and that his will can be
[1:15:46] performed in you i just i just think
[1:15:49] these things
[1:15:50] and then as we we closed up with it's
[1:15:53] the hour
[1:15:54] that's what makes that new creation so
[1:15:57] we're gonna
[1:15:58] listen to 16 more minutes uh
[1:16:01] tonight and uh i i hope that those that
[1:16:05] were here
[1:16:06] this morning that are going to follow
[1:16:09] with us
[1:16:10] through this easter seal that they
[1:16:12] listen at home
[1:16:14] of course you are at home i wish you
[1:16:16] were here
[1:16:17] but that's all i can do i guess is wish
[1:16:23] maybe i could send an email or a text
[1:16:25] out
[1:16:26] or something but i guess that won't work
[1:16:29] and i i hope that someday i don't say i
[1:16:32] wish you were
[1:16:34] here in the rapture you know but
[1:16:37] i'll be happy if i make it so i just
[1:16:40] trusting i'll make it so
[1:16:41] i know there's a lot of circumstances
[1:16:43] some people on vacation we pray for them
[1:16:46] we don't want to uh uh forget
[1:16:49] uh i i forget how you say her name
[1:16:53] annadell or on the dale is how you say
[1:16:55] it
[1:16:56] or addedale little two and a half pounds
[1:16:59] 15 ounce baby that was there and
[1:17:03] and uh that doesn't scare me uh
[1:17:06] guys i saw brother caleb
[1:17:10] he was pretty little remember sister
[1:17:12] jeannie
[1:17:13] my goodness i don't think he was as big
[1:17:15] as this water bottle was he
[1:17:17] what did you feed that boy
[1:17:21] you know anyway god certainly took care
[1:17:24] of him and
[1:17:26] natalie was a a few pounds she wasn't
[1:17:30] very
[1:17:31] uh big when she sprung up i want to say
[1:17:34] like a flower
[1:17:36] everybody says weed i just decide that
[1:17:38] doesn't
[1:17:39] sound good but uh she certainly a lord
[1:17:42] took care of her and we've seen
[1:17:44] very we've seen god do a little thing
[1:17:47] and
[1:17:47] and i guess uh brianna
[1:17:51] when she was come home she was only
[1:17:53] three pounds something but she was full
[1:17:54] term full healthy
[1:17:56] and everything it's just uh you know
[1:17:59] that's about half as much as gabrielle
[1:18:01] weighs so
[1:18:02] that's uh anyway
[1:18:05] the lord's the lord's been good to us
[1:18:07] hadn't he
[1:18:09] so we're grateful for that and
[1:18:12] we just trust that the lord will bless
[1:18:13] you so i think you'll enjoy this next
[1:18:16] uh 16 minutes because remember what the
[1:18:19] prophet of god saying
[1:18:21] he says i want to open this up to you
[1:18:24] because there's something
[1:18:25] in this hour this quickening power
[1:18:28] and how you get it and
[1:18:32] i know this is but this messenger's
[1:18:36] word was something that had to be
[1:18:39] preached
[1:18:41] right and now if that word's preached
[1:18:44] and it's in your heart
[1:18:46] now the spirit has something it can come
[1:18:50] bring to life it's got to be something
[1:18:53] it can identify with
[1:18:55] so you can have people out there and
[1:18:57] they can preach and what they get
[1:18:59] is they get an anointing they get the
[1:19:03] spirit that falls on the just and
[1:19:05] unjust the scripture says but they know
[1:19:07] it not
[1:19:09] but when that seed is in there he
[1:19:11] remember he drew that little
[1:19:13] serpent and you could do that little
[1:19:15] thing and he said
[1:19:16] this can fall but that falls on that
[1:19:18] seed then when that word
[1:19:20] falls on that believer's heart and that
[1:19:22] believer's seed
[1:19:24] now he can quicken that word
[1:19:27] because the holy spirit come to quicken
[1:19:30] that word we don't want the rain that
[1:19:33] falls on the justin
[1:19:35] unjust we want the resurrection
[1:19:40] life okay so i i don't want to
[1:19:44] get too doctrinal and separating
[1:19:48] but there is a reign a blessing of the
[1:19:50] holy spirit
[1:19:51] that falls upon everybody and then
[1:19:54] there's something that's given to the
[1:19:57] elect
[1:19:58] that's going to resurrect them and put
[1:20:01] them in the rapture
[1:20:02] that has a way to be delivered
[1:20:06] and the way it was delivered was through
[1:20:09] the fulfillment of malachi 4
[1:20:11] 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10
[1:20:15] 7 delivering something to the elect
[1:20:19] and brother ben's going to talk about it
[1:20:21] here i'm just preempting
[1:20:23] about something that's magnetized and
[1:20:26] and drawn that can be connected that the
[1:20:30] spirit can quicken so
[1:20:32] he came forth he preached out his
[1:20:34] message it falls into the ears of the
[1:20:37] believer
[1:20:38] it goes down in their heart now that
[1:20:40] spirit can come
[1:20:41] and make that alive if you don't sow it
[1:20:46] it can't be quickened and brought to
[1:20:48] life
[1:20:49] so we understand the importance of
[1:20:52] the message being preached in our day
[1:20:55] because god
[1:20:56] sends a messenger but he predestinates a
[1:20:59] seed
[1:21:00] to be there to receive it that he can
[1:21:04] now
[1:21:04] prove it to be true so you see where you
[1:21:08] are
[1:21:08] in the process you're receiving the word
[1:21:11] we've received the word
[1:21:13] now we come to that point where we know
[1:21:16] it
[1:21:16] we know it's true we know who we are
[1:21:19] we believe it with all our heart and
[1:21:21] there's a hunger in
[1:21:23] us to to
[1:21:27] make it a reality in us
[1:21:31] like i i like uh the
[1:21:34] prophet of god talks about the the
[1:21:36] laundry ticket
[1:21:38] remember it's got two parts and so now
[1:21:41] we've got this
[1:21:42] part is who we are and to have faith in
[1:21:45] who we are
[1:21:46] and what the word of god says about it
[1:21:48] so we have
[1:21:49] this part and we believe this part
[1:21:54] but there seems to be a chasm in between
[1:21:57] a gap in between and now we're crying
[1:22:01] uh for completion we're
[1:22:05] crying that this that we know is now
[1:22:09] connects up with us and makes us
[1:22:12] the full image that we grow into the
[1:22:16] full image
[1:22:17] but the first thing that god does
[1:22:20] is as we hold this so picture yourself
[1:22:23] on this side of the chasm
[1:22:26] and you believe who you are you know who
[1:22:28] you are you believe every word
[1:22:31] but yet you you sense in your spirit
[1:22:34] that you're calling for something
[1:22:38] to make it real in your life in every
[1:22:40] part of your life
[1:22:42] and he knows that so what he does he
[1:22:46] says right before the
[1:22:47] end he sends his angels to mark them
[1:22:51] that are sighing and crying so he's got
[1:22:54] to put us in a position
[1:22:56] that we're sighing and crying in order
[1:22:59] that he can mark us
[1:23:01] that we don't go into the judgment and
[1:23:04] then
[1:23:04] this connection is going to take place
[1:23:06] and we're going to have the full life
[1:23:08] the full token
[1:23:09] the full resurrection and and that's our
[1:23:12] messenger plays a great part
[1:23:14] in that in our lives so we're going to
[1:23:17] pick back up
[1:23:18] if you have your phones i guess or your
[1:23:20] books
[1:23:21] or or you can read on the board in
[1:23:23] paragraph
[1:23:24] 68 as he begins to speak and we're just
[1:23:28] going to read
[1:23:29] over through uh
[1:23:33] paragraph 105 16 minutes i think you'll
[1:23:36] enjoy it
[1:23:37] and god bless you tonight
[1:23:40] it sounded a little sacrilegious but i
[1:23:42] hope it don't tell you this morning
[1:23:44] the farmer that set the eagle or set the
[1:23:46] hand
[1:23:47] and had an eagle egg many of you
[1:23:48] remembers the story
[1:23:50] of the old eagle giving birth to to this
[1:23:53] uh
[1:23:53] or the hand giving birth over here to
[1:23:55] this chicken or
[1:23:57] egg of eagle under her chicken feathers
[1:24:00] see it's the atmosphere the presbyterian
[1:24:03] church
[1:24:04] methodist church baptist church any of
[1:24:06] them can bring forth these eagles
[1:24:09] sure it's the atmosphere that does it
[1:24:12] as dr bosworth you say you could take a
[1:24:14] hand egg and put it over a under a pup
[1:24:16] and time down
[1:24:17] a puppet hatch out of chicken wow it's
[1:24:20] the
[1:24:21] atmosphere and when any church or any
[1:24:24] group that'll civil themselves together
[1:24:26] and pray
[1:24:27] until they're throw away their creeds
[1:24:30] and things
[1:24:30] look straight in the face of god it'll
[1:24:32] bring forth
[1:24:34] eagles just as hurt as i'm standing here
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:38] that's what i think this businessman's
[1:24:40] group has done
[1:24:41] trying to break up the atmosphere we're
[1:24:43] getting to clannish
[1:24:45] one belongs to this and that let's break
[1:24:47] up the atmosphere and get the atmosphere
[1:24:49] in a
[1:24:50] heavenly worship get the atmosphere
[1:24:53] right
[1:24:54] eagles will be born and out of any
[1:24:57] church
[1:24:57] anywhere right and this little eagle
[1:24:59] walked with the end for a long time
[1:25:02] but the the clocking was kind of strange
[1:25:06] he didn't understand what the hen meant
[1:25:08] when she scratched in the
[1:25:10] the the waste of the manure piles in in
[1:25:13] the
[1:25:14] yards and that wasn't food to him
[1:25:18] and she eat bugs and so forth that eagle
[1:25:21] doesn't eat
[1:25:22] so it seems strange all to him and
[1:25:25] he was an ugly duckling he was uh
[1:25:29] not saying this sacrilegious maybe it's
[1:25:31] a free will baptist
[1:25:33] and but something on that order or
[1:25:35] presbyterian
[1:25:37] but you know one day his mother knew
[1:25:40] that she had laid an egg
[1:25:47] there had to be a child somewhere
[1:25:52] so she throwed her big wings into the
[1:25:55] winds and she
[1:25:56] searched and she searched screaming to
[1:25:59] the top of her voice
[1:26:01] and one day she passed over the barnyard
[1:26:05] and when this little eagle heard this
[1:26:07] familiar scream
[1:26:08] he had never heard it before but he
[1:26:11] realized that it fit him like a glove
[1:26:14] over
[1:26:14] him and he knew that was his mother
[1:26:19] she knew that was her son she was
[1:26:21] looking for him
[1:26:23] so has god in every age
[1:26:27] ordained his church for that age
[1:26:30] a message for that age and they could
[1:26:34] have
[1:26:34] laws in anything that they want to but
[1:26:37] when that hour comes
[1:26:38] the holy spirit of god
[1:26:42] which is at the beginning thought out
[1:26:44] and spoke out
[1:26:45] for that age that spirit hunts that egg
[1:26:49] and when he hears that
[1:26:51] message there is no church denomination
[1:26:54] going to hold it it'll rise to the
[1:26:56] heights
[1:26:57] oh hallelujah it's got to
[1:27:00] it's a different bird it's a different
[1:27:04] creature
[1:27:05] he's an eagle and he'll hear the scream
[1:27:09] my sheep hear my voice
[1:27:14] someone said brother williams sheep food
[1:27:17] my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[1:27:21] they will not follow no matter how loyal
[1:27:24] the church has been
[1:27:26] how much its bigger name is scott when
[1:27:28] my sheep
[1:27:29] hear my voice which is the word amen a
[1:27:32] stranger they
[1:27:33] will not follow they'll go right
[1:27:36] straight to that word
[1:27:37] they can't do it it's like a a magnet
[1:27:41] one day up in indiana i was visiting
[1:27:43] them steel mills
[1:27:45] and the whistle blowed and everybody
[1:27:48] took off their aprons and began to sweep
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:50] out from their lanes out into the middle
[1:27:52] of the floor the shavens that they
[1:27:54] made through the day and i was walking
[1:27:56] along with the man that was taking me
[1:27:57] through and he said
[1:28:00] watch this and so every man ladies
[1:28:04] is bench dressed up on the up on the
[1:28:08] table walked away way back in the back
[1:28:11] he touched the little
[1:28:12] button and here come a big magnet
[1:28:14] through
[1:28:15] and it picked up every bit of that the
[1:28:18] iron
[1:28:19] that was shaved off of those pieces now
[1:28:22] it went out it demagnetized it it
[1:28:24] dropped into a
[1:28:25] cupola and was melded over for another
[1:28:28] piece
[1:28:28] of of goods the same thing axles or
[1:28:31] whatever they were building
[1:28:34] and i stood there and looked at that
[1:28:35] until i i just lost myself
[1:28:38] and i said i'm wondering something he
[1:28:40] said what is it sir
[1:28:42] and i said i noticed that some of that
[1:28:45] didn't go up
[1:28:47] he said it's aluminum and the magnet is
[1:28:50] not magnetized to the aluminum
[1:28:53] i said i see and he said then i said
[1:28:56] well you notice
[1:28:57] there's a piece of iron laying across
[1:28:59] but you see sir it was bolted down
[1:29:02] i said i see and uh when he took it out
[1:29:05] and i said now what happened is that out
[1:29:06] there
[1:29:07] it says it goes right back into the mill
[1:29:09] poured out through the cupola he comes
[1:29:11] right back and makes another wheel
[1:29:13] i said praise the lord that's it see
[1:29:16] there is a great magnet sitting in the
[1:29:18] sky that god one day i'll touch his
[1:29:20] fingers to
[1:29:21] no man knows the time is coming not even
[1:29:24] the angels of heaven doesn't know
[1:29:26] god alone knows that's it but there has
[1:29:29] been some
[1:29:30] trimmings that's come off of the bible
[1:29:35] bible christians believers for this hour
[1:29:39] one of them might have been an axel back
[1:29:41] in another day this might be some other
[1:29:43] part
[1:29:43] it's going on to make the big regime of
[1:29:46] god
[1:29:47] but it'll be molded into the pop of
[1:29:50] god's great cupola
[1:29:51] and poured out again into the images of
[1:29:54] god
[1:29:55] and just those who are magnetized to it
[1:29:58] will be taken up
[1:29:59] oh out of what a privilege it is to know
[1:30:03] that there
[1:30:03] is something in the resurrection that's
[1:30:06] pertaining to us
[1:30:08] now notice it recognize the call of
[1:30:11] god's word
[1:30:12] which is a part of and it's an eagle
[1:30:16] to an eagle now if that mother would
[1:30:19] have screamed like a
[1:30:20] a buzzard he'd never noticed he'd been
[1:30:23] just as well off in the barnyard
[1:30:25] but it was a scream of an eagle there
[1:30:28] was something
[1:30:29] inside that little fella that he knowed
[1:30:32] he was an eagle
[1:30:34] and the same thing is with every true
[1:30:36] believer
[1:30:38] when this preaching of god's word comes
[1:30:40] forth
[1:30:41] and vindicated and proved that it's
[1:30:44] god's word for this hour
[1:30:46] then there's something within the
[1:30:47] believer i don't care how loyal his
[1:30:49] father was to a church or how
[1:30:50] loyal his mother was or his grandparents
[1:30:53] and if that church is teaching contrary
[1:30:55] to this hour of the baptism of the holy
[1:30:58] ghost message
[1:30:59] there's something in him it screams out
[1:31:03] he'll leave the barnyard he's got to do
[1:31:06] it
[1:31:06] the chicken might have been all right
[1:31:07] one day but this is eagle hour
[1:31:09] see it's a different it's something that
[1:31:12] he
[1:31:13] must leave the old cook and fly away
[1:31:16] into the blue
[1:31:18] then this earthly body is quickened and
[1:31:21] brought
[1:31:21] by the quickening spirit to the
[1:31:24] obedience of god's word
[1:31:26] now when this holy spirit represented as
[1:31:29] an eagle
[1:31:30] flying over the land and finds the
[1:31:32] believer
[1:31:33] no man can come to me
[1:31:37] no man can come to me as he wants to all
[1:31:40] the father has given me will come to me
[1:31:42] but no man can come by himself it isn't
[1:31:45] your own thinking your own drawing
[1:31:47] it's god drawing see all the father has
[1:31:50] given me will come to me now the holy
[1:31:52] spirit
[1:31:53] is here on earth looking out those
[1:31:56] individuals
[1:31:57] that god has ordained to life in this
[1:32:00] age
[1:32:01] and as soon as it finds it it does just
[1:32:03] like it did on jesus christ
[1:32:05] the great super son of god he who
[1:32:07] redeemed us all
[1:32:08] it comes down and takes his place of
[1:32:10] abode into the human life
[1:32:13] now notice brought the quickening power
[1:32:17] now that quickening power that come upon
[1:32:20] jesus
[1:32:21] quickened him to manifest every promise
[1:32:25] of the word
[1:32:26] of that day so does the holy spirit that
[1:32:29] come upon us in this day
[1:32:31] if it's not a mockery holy spirit if
[1:32:34] it's not the devil
[1:32:35] mock in the holy spirit but is the real
[1:32:37] true holy spirit
[1:32:39] it'll manifest the promise of this hour
[1:32:42] when it fell upon luther it manifested
[1:32:44] that promise of that hour
[1:32:46] when it fell upon wesley it manifested
[1:32:48] the promise of that hour
[1:32:50] when it falls in this day it manifests
[1:32:52] the promise of this hour
[1:32:54] when it fell upon moses it manifested
[1:32:56] the promise of that hour
[1:32:57] fell upon noah it manifests the promise
[1:32:59] of that hour
[1:33:00] when it fell upon jesus it manifests the
[1:33:02] promise of that hour
[1:33:04] see it's a holy spirit coming down
[1:33:08] to quicken make alive those
[1:33:11] people that's four ordained of god to be
[1:33:15] in the rapture
[1:33:16] most that is if he is a true eagle he
[1:33:19] will
[1:33:20] understand the message of the hour
[1:33:24] if he's a true eagle now the little
[1:33:26] eagle problem in the barn yard was
[1:33:27] eating all right
[1:33:29] but he you know it wasn't just exactly
[1:33:31] right
[1:33:32] but then when he heard the truth then he
[1:33:35] received
[1:33:36] this truth now in john 14 uh
[1:33:39] john 5 24 rather jesus said
[1:33:42] speaking this way he that heareth
[1:33:46] my words and believeth on him that sent
[1:33:49] me
[1:33:50] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[1:33:54] into the judgment
[1:33:55] but pass from death unto life
[1:33:58] just think how simple it is he that
[1:34:00] believeth
[1:34:01] now the correct way of saying that he
[1:34:03] that understandeth
[1:34:05] now while you're on the street and say
[1:34:07] to this prostitute you believe sure
[1:34:09] you believe the son of god certainly
[1:34:10] been baptized sure
[1:34:12] grant the drunkard say you hear that
[1:34:13] you're that preacher preached yeah you
[1:34:15] believe that sure
[1:34:16] see but he that understandeth amen
[1:34:20] he that knoweth his place in this hour
[1:34:23] he that heareth my word
[1:34:26] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:34:29] present tense
[1:34:30] eternal life shall not come into
[1:34:33] judgment but it's already passed from
[1:34:34] death
[1:34:35] unto life then when this new eternal
[1:34:38] life
[1:34:39] dwells in you it is the
[1:34:43] potential or the earnestness
[1:34:46] of you being quickened from mortal to
[1:34:49] immortality let me say
[1:34:52] again when this spirit
[1:34:56] has found you the individual
[1:34:59] and has come upon you it is the
[1:35:02] potential
[1:35:04] of your eternal inheritance that god
[1:35:09] thought of you and made for you before
[1:35:11] the foundation of the world that is
[1:35:14] your potential like if you ask me for an
[1:35:17] oak tree and i'll give you an acre
[1:35:19] now the the life for the oak tree is
[1:35:22] in the acorn now but you have to wait
[1:35:26] till it grows up
[1:35:27] so do we when you receive the holy
[1:35:29] spirit of god
[1:35:30] it's god's potential waiting upon you
[1:35:34] that's already recognized you and you're
[1:35:36] sealed by the spirit of promise of god
[1:35:38] into the body of christ when god looked
[1:35:41] down at calvary and seen jesus dying
[1:35:44] he not all he died for his bride the
[1:35:47] body
[1:35:48] which is the word church the church that
[1:35:51] believes the word of god for the age
[1:35:52] whether his feet
[1:35:53] body head or wherever it is see it's
[1:35:56] christ was bleeding and dying
[1:36:00] and god looking upon him saw his
[1:36:03] resurrection and the church
[1:36:05] raised with him on easter now
[1:36:08] i want you to get all this together
[1:36:09] cause i got something here
[1:36:11] a little bit i want to say the lord
[1:36:13] willing i notice it's the earnest
[1:36:16] or the potential the quickening
[1:36:20] power of your resurrection when you
[1:36:24] receive the holy spirit
[1:36:26] is then dwelling in you
[1:36:29] the potential of it notice you
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:33] you are now on your way growing to the
[1:36:36] full
[1:36:37] resurrection no tree just comes up
[1:36:40] overnight
[1:36:42] it's got to grow as we grow in the grace
[1:36:44] and knowledge of god
[1:36:46] you are baptized into the holy spirit
[1:36:48] now as a pentecostal church baptized
[1:36:50] into the holy spirit
[1:36:52] it's begin growing limbs has died it's
[1:36:54] pruned them all
[1:36:55] but the trees still growing it's still
[1:36:58] going on because it's got to come to the
[1:37:00] resurrection
[1:37:01] they're led by the spirit to quicken the
[1:37:04] word
[1:37:05] to you who is believers
[1:37:08] the word keeps quickness come the first
[1:37:10] limb second limb third limb
[1:37:12] or if it just keeps quickening the
[1:37:14] spirit of god keeps quickening to you
[1:37:16] notice that pentecost their bodies
[1:37:19] were quickened by the new life
[1:37:22] they received
[1:37:26] that makes me feel religious think
[1:37:29] now here was man fishermen tax
[1:37:32] collectors
[1:37:33] the humble little women other just
[1:37:36] ordinary housewives
[1:37:38] little virgin girls they were believers
[1:37:42] they were believing that this was the
[1:37:44] truth they believed that when jesus died
[1:37:46] they believed on him and rose up again
[1:37:49] from the dead they believed that to be
[1:37:51] the absolutely
[1:37:52] testimony of god that he had quickened
[1:37:54] him to life
[1:37:56] now they go up to the day of pentecost
[1:37:59] to receive their abstract you know what
[1:38:02] an abstract is
[1:38:03] is when a deeds been cleared they went
[1:38:06] up there to
[1:38:06] receive their abstract and they become
[1:38:10] quickened or what a thrill they bought
[1:38:13] the land
[1:38:14] been bought for him they had received it
[1:38:16] is it true or not
[1:38:17] we seen him raise up but now what about
[1:38:20] us we are witnesses
[1:38:22] we stood and seen the man crucified we
[1:38:25] seen the clouds come over the earth and
[1:38:27] darken the skies
[1:38:28] and the the earthquake and shook and had
[1:38:32] nervous prostration then when they put
[1:38:35] him in the grave they speared him in the
[1:38:36] heart with the spear
[1:38:38] and they took his body down and laid in
[1:38:40] the grave of
[1:38:41] joseph from armenia and then they find
[1:38:44] out that on the
[1:38:45] third day he raised up again
[1:38:49] and as the disciples said we are
[1:38:51] witnesses of this
[1:38:53] we seen him raise up we know he's alive
[1:38:58] now what did that do that took all the
[1:39:00] fear out
[1:39:02] no wonder jesus said fear not i'm he
[1:39:04] that was dead and is alive
[1:39:06] forevermore you're taking all the fear
[1:39:09] out
[1:39:10] when they did that now but when they
[1:39:12] went
[1:39:13] up to pentecost there they received the
[1:39:16] quickening power
[1:39:18] the power that made them alive now
[1:39:20] there's where i think that you
[1:39:22] presbyterian and meth
[1:39:34] i'll point out another
[1:39:39] statement that uh
[1:39:43] brother branham made that
[1:39:47] um to me there's the
[1:39:50] there are these little hidden comments
[1:39:54] that they slip by us
[1:39:57] so quickly and it's in paragraph 73
[1:40:02] if we could put up there and
[1:40:06] and again uh it's it's
[1:40:09] one of those inserts
[1:40:13] that brother branham makes in statements
[1:40:16] that he's preaching and he'll insert
[1:40:18] something in there
[1:40:20] and and you know i've
[1:40:24] probably you know like i said i've
[1:40:26] probably listened to this message
[1:40:28] several times over the course of
[1:40:32] um my years in the message
[1:40:35] but it seems like it becomes more alive
[1:40:40] every time you know and i i went back
[1:40:44] in who is this melchizedek and i found
[1:40:48] an old copy of who is this malteser that
[1:40:51] and to went and to look at the things
[1:40:55] that i
[1:40:56] underlined and there wasn't
[1:40:59] one thing that i underlined
[1:41:02] in my most recent listening
[1:41:05] that was in what i underlined ten years
[1:41:09] ago
[1:41:11] you know i just i just i marveled at
[1:41:14] what stood out to me then
[1:41:16] well that's what i needed then you
[1:41:19] understand it was perfectly ordained
[1:41:22] of god because that's what i needed and
[1:41:25] he said
[1:41:26] as we grow into the statue of a perfect
[1:41:29] man as we grow into the rapture
[1:41:32] we can't be afraid of the fact that
[1:41:34] we're growing
[1:41:35] you know nobody can come up and
[1:41:38] challenge
[1:41:39] you and say that you ought to be further
[1:41:41] along
[1:41:42] than this or you ought to know these
[1:41:44] things are you out of this
[1:41:46] no man makes that determination but the
[1:41:48] tutor himself
[1:41:50] he's the one that teaches he's the one
[1:41:53] that reshapes and molds the clay
[1:41:56] so he's the one that's doing the work
[1:41:59] but i want to if if you don't mind we're
[1:42:02] just
[1:42:02] we're taking our time right and we're
[1:42:05] looking at this message we can go home
[1:42:07] and read it we can listen to it
[1:42:09] other things will stand out to you that
[1:42:11] that don't stand out to me as the
[1:42:14] pastor i'm just giving us an opportunity
[1:42:17] for all of us to listen to it
[1:42:19] and i can just share with you what
[1:42:22] things stand out to me
[1:42:23] um and i'd be more than happy to
[1:42:26] listen to the things that stand out to
[1:42:29] you also but he says
[1:42:32] so god so has god
[1:42:39] in every age ordained his church
[1:42:42] for that age a message
[1:42:46] for that age now look at this
[1:42:49] next sentence
[1:42:53] i mean it struck me
[1:42:56] and they could have laws in anything
[1:43:00] that they want to
[1:43:04] but when the hour comes the holy spirit
[1:43:06] of god
[1:43:07] which was at the beginning throughout
[1:43:10] and spoke
[1:43:11] out for that age the spirit hunts
[1:43:14] that egg
[1:43:17] now it's almost
[1:43:21] like a warning you understand
[1:43:25] he says there's going to be laws
[1:43:31] and you know that
[1:43:34] that there is a great
[1:43:38] move amongst
[1:43:41] the the idea that
[1:43:47] to do away with the privileges
[1:43:51] that churches have
[1:43:54] they've always through our country
[1:43:57] they've given
[1:43:59] benefits tax benefits to churches
[1:44:03] little subtle tax benefits for
[1:44:07] ministries and different things because
[1:44:10] they
[1:44:10] felt that those ministries
[1:44:14] helped with the morals of the country
[1:44:17] and helped
[1:44:18] to promote a a lifestyle
[1:44:22] that didn't involved in crime also
[1:44:26] that they promoted charity
[1:44:29] of doing good works and helping
[1:44:31] everybody
[1:44:32] so man thought it was beneficial
[1:44:35] to have religion uh
[1:44:39] uh at work in our country a few years
[1:44:43] back
[1:44:45] and i'm not going into politics is as
[1:44:47] far as what's right or wrong
[1:44:49] you know it's like our messenger said i
[1:44:51] don't care whether you're a republican
[1:44:53] or a socialist
[1:44:54] it doesn't mean uh one thing
[1:44:58] uh but a few years back they
[1:45:02] they were going to do a program where
[1:45:04] they were going to
[1:45:06] take money and give it
[1:45:09] to charities and let the charities
[1:45:13] distribute
[1:45:14] the money if it was they were going to
[1:45:17] try to plate the welfare department
[1:45:19] and distribute it through charities and
[1:45:22] i think
[1:45:23] that it meant a challenge of the
[1:45:25] separation of
[1:45:26] church and state but the idea
[1:45:30] was the thought of it
[1:45:33] do you understand now there's millions
[1:45:36] and millions
[1:45:37] of dollars of untaxed property
[1:45:41] in the country plus
[1:45:45] they give you a tax benefit
[1:45:49] that if you give dollars to charitable
[1:45:54] organizations that's
[1:45:57] just what they do and they do not charge
[1:46:01] property tax on
[1:46:04] churches and the land the churches
[1:46:08] own but as our
[1:46:11] our country and our lifestyle
[1:46:16] means more and more uh
[1:46:20] for economic help
[1:46:23] and as as you you know
[1:46:26] the the gap between uh
[1:46:29] wealth and poverty always grows larger
[1:46:33] and it's just because people that have
[1:46:36] money they make money it just
[1:46:38] it's just one of the things that is
[1:46:40] almost the law
[1:46:41] the that's why the love of money is the
[1:46:45] root of all evil
[1:46:48] but they sit back and they say
[1:46:51] we could use that tax money
[1:46:56] to do a lot of social good
[1:47:00] and they probably could you know i might
[1:47:04] not agree with it
[1:47:05] but if what our country is based on what
[1:47:09] the majority of the people
[1:47:10] vote for then that's how that we'd go
[1:47:14] i mean that's just how we live in it in
[1:47:16] this place we don't have a dictator
[1:47:19] we don't have a king god's way to rule
[1:47:22] is with a king not with the president
[1:47:25] to have a righteous king that's that's
[1:47:28] that god
[1:47:29] would have the the rule be
[1:47:32] a king that had a heart for the people
[1:47:34] but
[1:47:35] this is what he said he said they may
[1:47:37] have laws
[1:47:39] so they're thinking about taxing
[1:47:42] i don't know what rate it would be at it
[1:47:45] might not be as high
[1:47:46] as your property tax i know some of you
[1:47:49] here own homes some of you rent homes
[1:47:52] some of you rent apartments
[1:47:54] but the owner of those things pays
[1:47:56] property tax
[1:47:57] i don't know if any of you got your last
[1:48:00] property tax bill
[1:48:02] but i like to died
[1:48:06] you know i had a little old house and
[1:48:08] they just decided
[1:48:10] that that house was worth uh 30 more
[1:48:13] percent than it was last year
[1:48:15] and i didn't see it
[1:48:19] you know but they don't care they just
[1:48:22] say hey pay some more
[1:48:23] money look if if they came to us
[1:48:28] and they said okay we're re-changing
[1:48:30] your tax structure
[1:48:32] now you're going to have to pay taxes
[1:48:35] and we we've got four acres here
[1:48:39] that we have in this building this
[1:48:42] building is appraised on the tarrant
[1:48:45] county tax rolls
[1:48:46] for eight hundred thousand dollars the
[1:48:49] property next to us is appraised for
[1:48:52] i don't know three or four hundred
[1:48:55] thousand dollars
[1:48:56] but because we're tax exempt then
[1:49:00] it's it's not the problem but can you
[1:49:03] imagine all of a sudden that they
[1:49:06] want the taxes
[1:49:09] even at two percent you you understand
[1:49:14] or or three it or three percent i lost
[1:49:17] my
[1:49:17] mic or something fell oh
[1:49:21] it's okay what phil
[1:49:24] you you dropped something you're scaring
[1:49:26] me to death
[1:49:31] yeah but i i i i'm just pointing out
[1:49:34] that to you because
[1:49:36] it's very easy for us to put our heads
[1:49:39] in the sand
[1:49:41] you understand and i know we forget
[1:49:43] about
[1:49:44] the world around us but
[1:49:47] this message as the world goes more and
[1:49:50] more
[1:49:51] and takes on satan's thinking
[1:49:54] the more and more they feel they don't
[1:49:57] need you
[1:49:59] and the more and more they feel that you
[1:50:02] become an
[1:50:03] obstacle to what they're doing
[1:50:07] you know just like who when they wanted
[1:50:10] to begin to teach
[1:50:12] our young children i'll just use
[1:50:15] the that this terminology you'll
[1:50:20] remember that when they begin to teach
[1:50:22] our
[1:50:23] children they wanted to start teaching
[1:50:24] in fifth and sixth grade
[1:50:26] the reproductive system of
[1:50:29] human beings and they wanted to you know
[1:50:32] take the girls and tell them all this
[1:50:34] and the boys and and and and
[1:50:37] you know now me personally i believe
[1:50:40] that belongs between mother and daughter
[1:50:44] and and it's a responsibility of the
[1:50:46] fathers to talk to their boys and
[1:50:49] and to tell them how to be gentlemen and
[1:50:52] how to act and how to talk
[1:50:54] and and the things we we don't do we can
[1:50:57] cover those things
[1:50:58] generally in church in terminologies
[1:51:02] that's
[1:51:02] understood but if it wasn't given to the
[1:51:05] school to do that
[1:51:07] that was my opinion and christians were
[1:51:10] a voice
[1:51:11] against that but the trouble is our
[1:51:14] voice is becoming
[1:51:15] in a minority they don't need to hear
[1:51:19] from us
[1:51:19] anymore because there's another thing
[1:51:22] that has to get
[1:51:24] fulfilled and that's the iniquity of the
[1:51:26] amorites
[1:51:28] it's got to get to a place where god can
[1:51:30] no
[1:51:31] longer stand it and we can no longer
[1:51:34] stand that
[1:51:35] and we start crying out for our
[1:51:38] deliverance
[1:51:39] from this because it's going to become
[1:51:43] abominable
[1:51:44] to us the the things that that trans
[1:51:48] expire and that abomination of daniel is
[1:51:51] going to come to that place
[1:51:53] where it's got to be fulfilled so
[1:51:56] i i thought it was something that the
[1:51:58] prophet of god said they may make laws
[1:52:06] now what would inspire him
[1:52:09] to in assert that statement and they
[1:52:12] could have
[1:52:13] laws in anything
[1:52:16] they want to
[1:52:20] what a warning god in every age has a
[1:52:24] message for that age
[1:52:25] and they could have laws in other words
[1:52:28] laws that i can't sit here and say
[1:52:31] that this this acceptance of
[1:52:36] homosexuality as
[1:52:39] being a normal way of life when the word
[1:52:42] of god
[1:52:43] directly says
[1:52:46] it's contrary that god
[1:52:49] give them over to a reprobate mind
[1:52:52] working that which is unseemingly
[1:52:55] the word of god's very plain on that
[1:53:01] you know but you become a
[1:53:04] it's a hate crime to preach life
[1:53:08] to people and
[1:53:12] we can't sit back and ignore
[1:53:15] the fact that this
[1:53:19] great uh
[1:53:24] eden that satan has made that
[1:53:27] he takes the position of the god of this
[1:53:30] evil age
[1:53:31] and we know that god is an object of
[1:53:34] worship
[1:53:36] so satan's developing a society
[1:53:39] he's developing a way of thinking he's
[1:53:42] developing a social network
[1:53:44] he's developing a social consciousness
[1:53:47] he's developing uh what what people feel
[1:53:50] is right and wrong
[1:53:52] and how they should treat one another
[1:53:54] and make up for
[1:53:56] past sins and and all these things he's
[1:53:58] inserting
[1:53:59] all these things into our society
[1:54:04] that are contrary to the word of god
[1:54:07] they're just
[1:54:08] contrary to the word of god i thank god
[1:54:12] that he sent his prophet in the time he
[1:54:15] sent them
[1:54:15] because that was probably the last time
[1:54:18] that that voice could have went out
[1:54:21] without some sort of legal
[1:54:26] you couldn't even use some of the words
[1:54:28] the prophet of god
[1:54:30] used now
[1:54:34] it would be offensive but we're not
[1:54:37] offended
[1:54:38] in the word of god i'm not offended by
[1:54:41] the gospel of jesus christ
[1:54:42] because it's the power of god unto
[1:54:45] salvation i'm not going to let
[1:54:46] the the social world
[1:54:50] divide my heart from the love of my
[1:54:53] brother look a christian has the love of
[1:54:57] god
[1:54:57] shed abroad in their heart by the holy
[1:55:00] spirit it's not their love
[1:55:01] it's not david mcgary's love this
[1:55:03] quickening power
[1:55:05] that he's talking about that comes on
[1:55:07] the believer before the rapture
[1:55:10] is a quickening power that is the same
[1:55:13] spirit
[1:55:14] that dwelt in jesus christ and he died
[1:55:16] on the cross for all men
[1:55:18] he died on the cross for all sicknesses
[1:55:20] he died on the cross for
[1:55:22] everybody that would receive him
[1:55:26] and we can't be any different and and
[1:55:28] we're talking about
[1:55:30] a time that what was prophesied to us
[1:55:33] that a squeeze would come
[1:55:37] and we're feeling that squeeze
[1:55:41] we're feeling the embarrassment i hate
[1:55:44] to sit in a restaurant and i get stirred
[1:55:46] up
[1:55:47] and i start talking and everybody's
[1:55:49] going shh
[1:55:53] he said what did i say you can't say
[1:55:55] that
[1:55:56] you can't talk like that today
[1:56:01] can you imagine that
[1:56:06] what we're pretty sure we're just gonna
[1:56:07] have to walk around with our hands in
[1:56:10] our pockets you know and
[1:56:11] and draw a little uh uh
[1:56:15] a little pillar of fire in the sand you
[1:56:18] know just a
[1:56:19] just a little switch like that and we
[1:56:22] know it's that pillar of fire right
[1:56:23] there you know
[1:56:24] we just know just the right angle to
[1:56:26] draw it you know
[1:56:28] i look at you and you look at me and you
[1:56:30] put your hand out
[1:56:32] peel our fire and we don't
[1:56:39] hallelujah you know
[1:56:44] in other words he says he's given us an
[1:56:49] understanding of these things
[1:56:51] they said they'll take these places and
[1:56:53] turn them into
[1:56:55] a storehouses
[1:56:58] so cook what happens
[1:57:03] if the squeeze comes
[1:57:06] if they tax us out of existence
[1:57:10] you know what i mean if we can't preach
[1:57:13] the gospel
[1:57:15] freely because there's so many
[1:57:19] things that people become offended
[1:57:23] in and the scripture is blessed is he
[1:57:25] who's not offended in me
[1:57:29] any christian that stands up regardless
[1:57:32] of
[1:57:33] race color creed you're going to meet it
[1:57:37] amongst
[1:57:38] the very uh society
[1:57:41] that you come from that the christian is
[1:57:44] going to stand
[1:57:45] out as an oddball that's thus saith the
[1:57:48] lord from the messenger of the hour
[1:57:54] and we're not always going to have the
[1:57:56] freedom
[1:57:58] that we have so it
[1:58:01] behooves us well the opportunity is
[1:58:05] present
[1:58:06] and as this messenger begins to talk
[1:58:10] about this power
[1:58:13] that is quickened to the believer that
[1:58:16] can't be taken away
[1:58:19] just he's saying that she is going to go
[1:58:22] on
[1:58:23] and hunt that egg
[1:58:27] so that spirit in us
[1:58:30] even if the government tells us no
[1:58:33] we are still going to be looking for
[1:58:35] that last soul
[1:58:37] we are still going to be preaching this
[1:58:39] word we are still going to be trying to
[1:58:40] deliver
[1:58:41] the resurrection power to whoever
[1:58:45] will receive it we are not identified
[1:58:49] with
[1:58:49] anything my identity lies in
[1:58:52] the word of god which is christ jesus
[1:58:55] and every one of us
[1:58:59] is going to have to make that stand it's
[1:59:02] easy for me
[1:59:03] because i'm in the twilight of my life
[1:59:06] but it's harder on you young people i
[1:59:09] noticed the other day that they
[1:59:11] could they just eliminated 500 so many
[1:59:15] million
[1:59:16] dollars of student loans
[1:59:19] well i know who those guys are going to
[1:59:21] vote for
[1:59:23] i just felt terrible bad i didn't have
[1:59:25] one
[1:59:29] nice to go borrow money and just have
[1:59:30] someone wipe the loan away
[1:59:33] you know let me tell you you borrow
[1:59:35] something
[1:59:36] you still owe it you know
[1:59:40] so you know it that's just
[1:59:44] the way it is you know i mean i can i
[1:59:47] i tell a lot of people don't worry about
[1:59:49] it
[1:59:50] you don't owe me nothing and i'll let it
[1:59:53] go
[1:59:54] but let me tell you there's another side
[1:59:56] of that scripture
[1:59:58] you understand you better pass the same
[2:00:00] grace onto
[2:00:02] somebody else you know when you get
[2:00:05] something you better be able to help
[2:00:08] give down the road you know what i mean
[2:00:11] you just don't go take something
[2:00:13] and then use it for your own benefit and
[2:00:15] think you got away with it
[2:00:17] you don't get away with anything with
[2:00:20] the lord
[2:00:22] he may give you forgiveness and mercy
[2:00:24] but he said
[2:00:26] as i have loved you so do you love
[2:00:28] others
[2:00:29] what i've done for you you also do for
[2:00:32] others
[2:00:33] father forgive us our trespasses as we
[2:00:35] forgive
[2:00:36] those who trespass against us i i just
[2:00:40] thought how
[2:00:43] amazing it was he said there could be
[2:00:47] laws but it's not going to stop
[2:00:50] the spirit of god from moving so i think
[2:00:53] this is a great
[2:00:54] time that we listen to this message
[2:00:59] and we understand that he's laying the
[2:01:02] framework here
[2:01:04] and he's go talking and he's going to
[2:01:06] get deeper into
[2:01:08] what that quickening power is what
[2:01:10] effect that quickening power has
[2:01:13] how it brings that word to life what
[2:01:15] that
[2:01:16] kicking power does for you and what that
[2:01:19] quickening power does
[2:01:20] through you to others
[2:01:24] and so we would we would i think would
[2:01:27] be
[2:01:27] naive if we didn't feel
[2:01:30] that the world is not going to give us
[2:01:33] resistance
[2:01:35] i don't think we have to be afraid
[2:01:38] because he said that eliminates our fear
[2:01:42] but you know he is going to make it
[2:01:48] scary
[2:01:50] he may threaten you with your job you
[2:01:52] may say you have to work on sundays i
[2:01:54] don't know what he'll do
[2:01:56] but i know one thing the righteous shall
[2:01:59] not date bread
[2:02:02] you say how's it going to work i don't
[2:02:04] know
[2:02:06] but that's what he said you know
[2:02:09] i don't know if we can go places without
[2:02:14] you know different things i know this
[2:02:18] vaccine was a great thing about
[2:02:20] vaccinated
[2:02:22] passports and where you've got to be
[2:02:24] vaccinated before you can travel and
[2:02:27] and all those things and all that
[2:02:28] control let me tell you something you
[2:02:30] guys know this it's
[2:02:32] planted as a seed first ah there it is
[2:02:35] yes sir and then eventually it works
[2:02:38] toward it
[2:02:39] you go read in the church age book about
[2:02:42] the trail of sin
[2:02:43] and the joining of the church and the
[2:02:46] state
[2:02:47] and how it started out and how it does
[2:02:49] and then everybody that has a claim
[2:02:52] of christianity all the trinitarian
[2:02:54] churches
[2:02:55] all join together and they back with the
[2:02:57] government yeah we're the ones
[2:02:59] we're the social ones this is just a
[2:03:01] cult
[2:03:04] you know what i mean and they hate
[2:03:06] people
[2:03:08] you know they preach against
[2:03:11] divorce and drug use and alcohol
[2:03:15] abuse and and and having televisions
[2:03:22] when my children were young
[2:03:27] my children were young they went
[2:03:30] to school first and second grade
[2:03:33] or something and told the teacher
[2:03:37] that we didn't have a television and the
[2:03:40] child
[2:03:41] protection agency sent someone out to
[2:03:44] our house
[2:03:45] to check us out
[2:03:49] it was just god's grace that i wasn't
[2:03:51] there
[2:03:54] because by the time leslie got done
[2:03:56] talking to her she felt that she might
[2:03:58] need the holy ghost
[2:04:03] you know but
[2:04:06] and you say birmingham this isn't what
[2:04:08] we want to hear i just want you to
[2:04:10] know that there's wolves out there
[2:04:13] that's right
[2:04:15] okay and we would we would not
[2:04:19] we would be foolish not to realize
[2:04:23] that our enemy is fixing
[2:04:26] to do battle and the battle is going to
[2:04:29] be
[2:04:30] in our minds and we have a weapon
[2:04:34] and that weapon is not the bible
[2:04:37] unrevealed
[2:04:40] but it's the revealed word of god for
[2:04:43] the hour
[2:04:44] and that's why you'll hear them
[2:04:46] throughout this message
[2:04:47] talk about the word for the hour not for
[2:04:50] another day the word for the hour
[2:04:52] the word for this hour he said baptist
[2:04:55] methodist and presbyterian
[2:04:56] could not produce eagle food
[2:05:01] we just heard it it's not there
[2:05:04] this is where it is that's going to
[2:05:08] be able he said they cannot meet the
[2:05:10] challenge
[2:05:11] for the hour there's one place that
[2:05:14] meets the challenge for the hour
[2:05:16] and that's the revealed word of god for
[2:05:19] the age i
[2:05:20] know that he's going to try to make us
[2:05:22] embarrassed
[2:05:23] that we have a picture like this in our
[2:05:26] church
[2:05:28] or make us embarrassed that we listen to
[2:05:31] tapes
[2:05:32] you're following a man i hope that you
[2:05:35] can look past that veil
[2:05:37] and see that we're not following a man
[2:05:39] there was something
[2:05:41] else that was revealing himself through
[2:05:44] that man that we heard and caught
[2:05:47] because we caught the eagle stream and
[2:05:50] god's going to have
[2:05:51] that church whether they make
[2:05:54] laws or not that's going to listen to it
[2:05:58] i just thought that was a
[2:05:59] very interesting insert
[2:06:03] in there and i i hope that you get
[2:06:05] involved in
[2:06:06] those of you that are at home uh
[2:06:10] that you that you join us in this
[2:06:13] study of the easter seal
[2:06:16] and that you enjoy it in and
[2:06:20] you would contribute through your
[2:06:23] prayers
[2:06:24] and through your pulling from the word
[2:06:28] of god so
[2:06:29] lord bless you he it's perfectly
[2:06:33] how he said that we're just going to
[2:06:34] grow up
