[7:53] our messenger used
[7:56] in matthew the 13th chapter
[7:59] starting with the
[8:01] uh 24th verse
[8:04] and then also we want to
[8:08] flip over and then we'll read out of
[8:17] the
[8:19] i guess the 36th and the
[8:23] through the 43rd
[8:25] verse so let us turn
[8:28] there in our bibles tonight and
[8:31] the lord would
[8:34] bless us we just have a little thought
[8:36] tonight i think that
[8:39] we'll be able to enjoy so
[8:42] i'm going to be in missouri this weekend
[8:44] so
[8:45] i felt that i'd just like to take this
[8:47] evening's
[8:49] uh
[8:51] service and
[8:52] just fellowship with you
[8:55] this evening so
[8:57] if we start in the
[8:59] uh
[9:01] my
[9:02] the 13th chapter
[9:04] and starting with the 24th
[9:08] verse
[9:09] and another parable put he forth
[9:13] unto them saying the kingdom of heaven
[9:17] is like an unto a man
[9:20] which soweth good seed in his field
[9:24] but while men slept
[9:27] his enemy
[9:29] come and sowed tares
[9:31] among the wheat
[9:33] and went his way
[9:35] and when the blade was sprung
[9:38] up
[9:38] and brought forth fruit
[9:40] then appeared the tares also
[9:44] so the servant of the house holder came
[9:47] and said unto him sir
[9:49] deadest doubt
[9:51] did didest not doubt so good seed in thy
[9:56] field
[9:58] from whence then hath it tares
[10:02] and he said unto them an enemy has done
[10:05] this
[10:06] the servant said unto him
[10:09] without then that we go and gather them
[10:12] up
[10:13] but he said nay lest while ye gather up
[10:17] the tares you root up also the wheat
[10:20] with them
[10:22] amen but let them both grow up until the
[10:24] harvest
[10:25] and in the time of the harvest
[10:28] i will say
[10:30] to the reapers gather ye together first
[10:32] the tares and bind them in bundles and
[10:35] burn them but rather the wheat into my
[10:38] barn and we know the prophet of god told
[10:41] us the interpretation of that gathering
[10:44] was the world council of churches and
[10:47] the church is coming together
[10:49] and then
[10:51] we we go over it and i believe also this
[10:55] is in
[10:59] matthew also
[11:01] ended
[11:02] and this is that 36th
[11:04] verse
[11:06] he said and jesus sent the multitude
[11:08] away
[11:09] and went in to the house
[11:12] and his disciples came unto him saying
[11:15] declare unto us the parable
[11:18] of the tares of the field
[11:21] and he answered and said
[11:23] unto them
[11:24] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[11:27] of man
[11:29] amen
[11:31] amen that's ministry in our day
[11:33] the field is the world
[11:36] the good seed are the children
[11:39] of the kingdom
[11:41] but the tares are the children of the
[11:44] wicked one
[11:46] the enemy that soweth them is the devil
[11:50] the harvest is the end of the world and
[11:53] the reapers are the angels
[11:56] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[11:59] burned into fire so shall it be at the
[12:03] end of this world the son of man shall
[12:06] send forth his angels and they shall
[12:09] gather out of his kingdom
[12:11] all things that offend and them which do
[12:17] iniquity and shall cast them into the
[12:20] furnace of fire there shall be wailing
[12:24] and gnashing
[12:25] of teeth then shall the righteous shine
[12:28] forth as the son
[12:30] in the kingdom of their father he who
[12:33] hath ear to hear
[12:34] let him hear heavenly father we ask you
[12:37] to bless your word to us in jesus
[12:39] precious name we pray
[12:41] amen
[12:42] amen god bless you may be seated
[12:57] it's certainly
[13:00] always nice to gather out in the house
[13:02] of the lord
[13:03] and to talk about the things
[13:06] we're get like i said we'll be in
[13:08] missouri this weekend uh
[13:11] helping the brothers there they're
[13:13] going through the process of
[13:15] how to select a new pastor and
[13:18] and uh
[13:19] of course brother brown's passing
[13:21] uh caught us all by
[13:24] surprise but um
[13:27] so we're going to pick up when we get
[13:30] back
[13:31] ministering
[13:32] out of the rising
[13:35] of the sun but i just wanted to share
[13:37] this little
[13:39] thought
[13:40] with us
[13:42] so we know that god in the beginning
[13:46] sowed his word
[13:48] and so that's what we
[13:50] we understood we read the statements and
[13:53] we read the quotes that
[13:55] that your god he he
[13:58] plants his word he sows his word and
[14:02] then he sends his holy spirit out to
[14:04] find that seed
[14:06] and he uses the great story
[14:09] of the eagle that
[14:11] that went out she knew she had an egg
[14:14] she knew that she had something that was
[14:16] a part of her
[14:19] that was somewhere that was given into
[14:21] the care
[14:22] another parable we know is that the
[14:25] shepherd when when one of his sheep is
[14:27] not found in the flock he goes out and
[14:30] finds that sheep
[14:32] and so
[14:33] all of us were were born in sin and
[14:36] shape and iniquity and we came into the
[14:38] world uh speaking lies but there was
[14:41] something in us that god had planted
[14:44] there
[14:45] and because he planted it there he went
[14:48] and found us
[14:50] and so he he searched for us and he
[14:52] found us he says you have not chosen me
[14:55] i have chosen you and so he came along
[14:58] and he found us and then so after he
[15:01] found us he quickened us
[15:04] he brought us to life and and uh
[15:07] we were
[15:08] as the saying would go we were green
[15:10] behind the ears we we didn't know
[15:13] anything alls we knew is that we weren't
[15:16] what we used to be that there had been a
[15:18] change in us and
[15:20] and all of a sudden we felt conviction
[15:23] and we felt that we didn't want to
[15:25] participate and do the things we used to
[15:28] do
[15:30] we began to find a peace
[15:32] and a joy with what came with our new
[15:36] transformation and
[15:38] but yet we didn't understand we didn't
[15:40] even understand the depths of our enemy
[15:44] well we didn't know how low that he
[15:46] would go we really didn't know anything
[15:48] about god we didn't know any doctrines
[15:51] we were just a little teeny blade that
[15:55] just popped up
[15:57] from a surface i i always liked a
[16:01] watermelon seed because i like that
[16:04] little two-bladed little thing that that
[16:08] came up you know and and uh
[16:10] i i used to throw all my watermelon
[16:13] seeds out and see that little thing pop
[16:17] up you know and i dig it and see that
[16:19] little thing coming out of that seed and
[16:21] and then you know grow into big
[16:23] watermelons and
[16:24] and so we knew that that we just come to
[16:28] life and then god wants to uh
[16:31] uh nourish us so he's got to feed us you
[16:35] know and that's what he told peter he
[16:37] said feed my sheep
[16:38] feed my lambs you know
[16:41] he's going to feed us and and grow us up
[16:44] and bring us into maturity he's going to
[16:47] be a husband tree over the field he's
[16:49] going to weed out the things and after
[16:52] and and let the sunlight shine upon us
[16:55] until he brings us to a place that we
[16:57] can be harvested
[16:59] and so
[17:00] uh
[17:01] we know that that's the the plan of god
[17:05] and so so we we know and if i could read
[17:08] this statement to you it says
[17:11] now it's harvest time
[17:14] at the beginning when god sowed his seed
[17:18] upon the earth
[17:19] and gave it in the hearts of his
[17:22] children
[17:23] his family to keep that word
[17:26] that was their only defense
[17:30] keep that word and he says
[17:34] and here comes the enemy in
[17:38] and broke that barrier
[17:40] by sowing the seed of discrepancy
[17:45] contrary to the word of god
[17:48] that was
[17:50] that was discrepancy in the beginning
[17:53] and still is
[17:55] anything that will add anything to the
[17:58] word of god is still the seed of
[18:02] discrepancy
[18:05] i don't care where it comes from
[18:09] it comes if
[18:11] where it comes from if it's from
[18:14] organization
[18:15] if it's from military sources
[18:18] if it's from political sources anything
[18:22] that's contrary to the word of god
[18:25] is the seed of discrepancy
[18:29] now that's uh and so what is a
[18:33] discrepancy so we know that god planted
[18:36] his seed and it's in our heart
[18:40] but he also said and that was his plan
[18:42] that was his defense
[18:44] but the enemy came in and it said he
[18:46] said he went down
[18:48] and i
[18:49] i went down and found the word of
[18:52] discrepancy
[18:54] so i got the dictionary and i looked up
[18:56] what discrepancy means
[18:59] and it means
[19:01] sowing
[19:02] discord
[19:04] or
[19:05] being
[19:06] contrary
[19:09] now just think of that sowing discord
[19:12] and being contrary
[19:14] you know
[19:15] uh
[19:16] that's uh
[19:18] that's very easily done
[19:21] you know what i mean just
[19:25] you know to be contrary
[19:27] says sowing a discord something
[19:31] different
[19:32] or being contrary to what's already
[19:37] ben
[19:38] now and so if i i if i had a little
[19:41] title
[19:42] uh for uh
[19:45] this thought tonight
[19:46] i i would want to say that
[19:49] there's a
[19:50] another sower
[19:54] there's another sower
[19:56] and so
[19:58] we're living life and we we talked about
[20:02] in the rising of the sun
[20:04] we realize that god planted the seed and
[20:07] he had to have
[20:09] something that shined upon that seed to
[20:12] bring it to light
[20:14] and so he left the pattern because
[20:17] the invisible things of god are clearly
[20:19] seen in the visible things around us so
[20:22] the earth was without form or void
[20:25] and there was waters upon the earth and
[20:28] god moved upon the earth and now he was
[20:31] going to quicken that seed to life now a
[20:35] lot of times we think that the sun
[20:38] quickened the seed really what quickened
[20:40] the seed was the spoken word which said
[20:44] let there be light
[20:46] and then when the light that was the
[20:49] spoken word manifested
[20:53] shined on that seed
[20:55] that seed began to come
[20:58] to life
[21:00] and and so uh i'd like to
[21:03] lay this because we we're what we want
[21:06] to talk about is this other sower
[21:10] now we're real focused
[21:13] on the spirit of god uh
[21:16] quickening the word to us
[21:19] we're excited
[21:21] about what god's doing we see the holy
[21:23] spirit moving we saw the other evening
[21:27] where a brother had on his heart to to
[21:30] to pray and and okay and i was sitting
[21:34] up here on the platform and the lord
[21:36] spoke to my part have the brothers have
[21:39] brother uh step on and the brothers pray
[21:42] for you and and i i got up and and and i
[21:45] i came i think maybe it was cosmine that
[21:48] was here and i said i want you to call
[21:50] the brothers and have them pray for and
[21:53] i said sometimes and they were sitting
[21:55] in the back of the church
[21:58] talking about
[21:59] we need to go pray for the brethren
[22:03] and so
[22:04] that wasn't orchestrated through any
[22:07] form of telepathy
[22:10] you know understand there was another
[22:12] being
[22:14] that was present
[22:17] that that god done something for uh many
[22:20] of you
[22:21] christians have realized how it's just
[22:24] something just it just has got to be the
[22:27] lord the way that it just works out you
[22:30] know the other day i was i inquired
[22:32] about a brother i looked over and says
[22:34] what about this uh pursuit that you were
[22:37] taking uh you know i i was curious i
[22:40] thought that was gonna happen and sure
[22:42] enough it just
[22:44] turns around and and right after we talk
[22:46] about it god brings it to pass and so
[22:49] it's not any reflection on any of us
[22:53] it's a reflection on the fact that god
[22:56] wants to move in our midst he's trying
[22:59] to bring us to a place
[23:02] that we
[23:04] are our participant in the supernatural
[23:08] and god chose man so in order to bring
[23:11] the supernatural to past he has got to
[23:16] have something to manifest in that's
[23:19] right
[23:20] do you understand so
[23:22] teaching is nothing but intellect until
[23:26] it's manifested in the flesh
[23:29] till somebody speaks it somebody does it
[23:32] the actions are taken and the fruit of
[23:35] those actions
[23:37] are approved
[23:40] so we could talk all we want about the
[23:42] scriptures saying lay hands on the sick
[23:46] or god's a healer but those are idle
[23:49] words
[23:50] until somebody comes along takes that
[23:53] word
[23:55] puts it into action
[23:58] and carries it out
[24:00] and then it's manifested now it's been
[24:04] proved to be true
[24:06] and therefore now it becomes living word
[24:09] god doesn't want a dead church
[24:12] he doesn't want ceremonies he doesn't
[24:14] want
[24:16] people just carrying on and and uh
[24:20] just
[24:21] having some sort of form of godliness
[24:24] but denying the power thereof god wants
[24:28] the power in
[24:30] his church that's why he sent him to the
[24:33] upper room and said go there and tarry
[24:36] until you're in dude with power from on
[24:40] high
[24:41] so if that was for the first church if
[24:44] that god was will his will for the first
[24:47] church for his children that's his will
[24:50] for his children today he doesn't want
[24:53] you to be powerless
[24:56] he doesn't want you to be
[24:58] brought into subjection he doesn't want
[25:01] you in bondage but he wants you to be
[25:04] free
[25:04] and not only does he want you to be free
[25:07] and i know we battle against the lust of
[25:09] the flesh the pride of life the lust of
[25:12] the eyes we these are all things that we
[25:14] fight with we have personalities that we
[25:17] have to bring in subjection paul says i
[25:20] die daily i bring myself into subjection
[25:23] but yet there's a hunger in our heart to
[25:26] have all this message that we believe
[25:29] for so long to really become a reality
[25:33] i think that we want to overcome
[25:37] and you say why would we want to
[25:39] overcome because it's given to the
[25:41] overcomer
[25:44] it's given to the overcomer
[25:49] just like that life has got to come out
[25:51] of the earth and we realize that seed
[25:54] life that's in us has got to come out
[25:58] and it has fruits every seed that's
[26:01] planted has a fruit if it doesn't have a
[26:04] fruit and it can't reproduce itself then
[26:08] it's a hybrid and it dies right there
[26:11] and that's the end of the train but
[26:14] that's not the way that god wants us to
[26:16] be he wants us to be fruitful and that's
[26:18] what he even said to adam go out
[26:20] multiply be fruitful
[26:23] he said you are the salt of the earth so
[26:25] he wants the believers to be fruitful
[26:28] if he wants them to
[26:30] manifest something and i believe that
[26:33] there's a time now in the church
[26:36] where god's really moving on his real
[26:40] children and they're hungry
[26:43] to
[26:44] live
[26:45] real overcoming christian lives
[26:50] i think they're tired of all the
[26:53] negativity
[26:55] that we possess
[26:57] and we want to overcome this negativity
[26:59] we want to overcome thinking that we
[27:02] don't feel godly we we want to we want
[27:06] to be able to pray we want to be able to
[27:09] feel the move of the spirit and and be
[27:11] able to bear burdens of our brothers and
[27:14] sisters i think that there's just a time
[27:17] that we really want to start being
[27:19] christ-like
[27:20] we don't want to hide in our teaching
[27:23] you know the message of the hour
[27:25] empowers
[27:26] a believer even in the intellect they
[27:30] can use brother branham stories they can
[27:32] use his statements they can use his
[27:34] little
[27:35] expressions of understanding and almost
[27:39] close the mouth of anybody that would
[27:42] dispute with you
[27:45] but that's not what we're wanting
[27:50] you know we don't want to be combative
[27:53] we want to be servants
[27:56] we want to let our light shine we want
[27:58] we want the lord to live in us and we
[28:01] want the love of god shed abroad in our
[28:04] heart by the holy spirit we want to love
[28:07] one another we want to serve one another
[28:10] we want to carry out his will
[28:13] and
[28:14] so uh we understand that there's
[28:17] something that god planted
[28:20] and so i i i really believe that we're
[28:24] we're sensing that we're sensing that
[28:26] there's that god is
[28:29] moving and every time god moves we know
[28:32] that
[28:33] along with every upward move there's a
[28:36] there's a falling away there's
[28:41] just something that transpires where
[28:45] people
[28:46] decide not to go on they're comfortable
[28:50] to a certain place
[28:52] and then when it seems like the pressure
[28:54] is starting to come on and and the
[28:56] gospel is starting to move into their
[28:58] lives and they they they shrink away
[29:02] whether we don't know why that is uh
[29:05] it's always been that way with that you
[29:08] could study the two revivals you could
[29:11] study every time there's a move of god
[29:14] not everybody turns the corner
[29:17] people set up camps and they get to a
[29:20] place in their life where i'm kind of
[29:21] comfortable the way things are sort of
[29:24] like the little eaglets in the nest you
[29:26] know and god starts shaking the nest and
[29:29] the church starts moving and and when
[29:32] you move you've got to move from what
[29:34] you've become comfortable with into a
[29:37] higher realm
[29:39] and
[29:41] you know i have this on my heart i'd
[29:43] like to preach it when we get through
[29:46] with the message
[29:49] of
[29:50] it is the rising of the sun
[29:52] but there's a
[29:54] kind of two forms of leadership
[29:57] and one of them is the leadership of the
[30:00] word that's where you can read the word
[30:03] and it says you know do this
[30:06] do this do this
[30:08] sustain from this be careful about this
[30:11] and then there's that other leadership
[30:13] that
[30:14] comes from i have need to go by here
[30:18] or or i i feel led like the messenger
[30:21] felt led he come out and brother branham
[30:24] came out of the airport and i believe it
[30:26] was a memphis and something said start
[30:29] walking
[30:30] and remember he stopped but you know
[30:33] looked around he says walk
[30:35] and he looked at his watch and and do
[30:38] you know the story very well and he felt
[30:41] led
[30:42] and then when he came down that street
[30:44] there was another
[30:46] person
[30:47] that was led
[30:49] now remember
[30:50] she wasn't in the message
[30:52] that we call the message
[30:55] but she was in the message of the holy
[30:58] spirit
[31:01] okay and she recognized
[31:04] this
[31:06] preacher or parson
[31:08] as being
[31:10] elijah
[31:12] it's a wonder it's a wonderful story of
[31:15] the moving of the spirit of god
[31:19] and
[31:20] and of how that god moves and so we know
[31:26] that we know certain things right we
[31:28] know that
[31:30] we shouldn't cut our hair i mean that's
[31:33] what the prophet of god taught in fact
[31:35] he even said in question questions and
[31:37] answers i would that you wouldn't even
[31:40] put scissors
[31:42] on it now that's
[31:44] obedience to the word
[31:48] you you understand
[31:50] we know that we should be
[31:52] shame-faced and
[31:54] and sober
[31:56] he talks about
[31:58] men not having long hair and and bangs
[32:02] and wearing uh these uh bermudas and
[32:06] things like that and so we have that
[32:08] leadership and we obey that
[32:11] by because the spirit a quickens to us
[32:15] and tells us to keep his word
[32:18] and that becomes a defense
[32:21] and it becomes a blessing to us we you
[32:24] know
[32:25] more items pertain to
[32:29] sisters concerning dress
[32:31] than that it does to men
[32:34] but
[32:35] you you you know those things and you do
[32:38] those things by
[32:40] the obedience to the word of god in
[32:43] other words you're instructed and you
[32:45] know those things are true and you keep
[32:48] those things but there's another form of
[32:51] leadership that's where god can speak to
[32:54] you
[32:55] and you can follow the holy unction now
[32:59] they're never contrary one to another
[33:02] they're in perfect harmony but in order
[33:06] to get to the higher form of leadership
[33:10] the obedience to the first leadership
[33:14] has to be in place
[33:17] he who is entrusted with much
[33:20] you understand and then that is if
[33:23] faithful in the level will be faithful
[33:27] in
[33:28] the the much
[33:29] it and so this is what that we want to
[33:33] talk about
[33:34] we want to talk about this other sower
[33:38] because this is this other sower
[33:43] is
[33:44] the hindrance
[33:47] to
[33:48] the crop
[33:50] and so i like this statement i don't
[33:53] know if they want to put the statements
[33:55] up or not but
[33:56] this
[33:57] is in paragraph 62
[34:00] of the message
[34:01] it is the rising of the sun
[34:04] he says hebrews 13 8 says he's the same
[34:08] yesterday
[34:09] today
[34:11] and forever
[34:14] we his beneficiaries
[34:17] are to prove
[34:19] his life
[34:21] is in us now
[34:23] so okay that that's what so if that's
[34:26] what we're to do
[34:28] then
[34:29] we were to do that because god desires
[34:32] us to do that
[34:35] you understand and if you're his and
[34:38] god's desiring for you to put that life
[34:41] on display then you feel that pull
[34:45] in your heart i want more of god i want
[34:48] his life on display i want to be more of
[34:51] a christian i want to be more of a a
[34:55] real a believer i want to prove his life
[35:00] is in us now
[35:03] well that's hard if you're looking at
[35:05] the same person in the mirror that i'm
[35:07] looking at
[35:09] so it makes me cry out more
[35:12] lord i need more of you
[35:16] i need your grace i need your mercy i
[35:19] need your instruction i need you to help
[35:21] me overcome i i want you said that you
[35:26] would prove that you're alive in me not
[35:30] somebody else
[35:31] not the church but this is a promise
[35:34] that brought to me and you sent a
[35:37] messenger to me
[35:40] you veiled yourself in human flesh you
[35:42] called a young boy named
[35:45] billy branham you sent an a angel to him
[35:49] he became a minister reverend william
[35:51] branham and he stayed true to the
[35:53] message and he spoke the words of life
[35:57] that will quicken
[35:59] the seed that's in me
[36:01] that i can manifest it
[36:04] that's right so i want that
[36:08] i don't want to sit there and believe it
[36:10] that it's true
[36:12] that's the same pillar of our that's
[36:14] true that's the statue of perfect man
[36:15] that's true that's the cloud that
[36:17] appeared for the seven seals that's true
[36:20] that's the hoffman's head of christ the
[36:21] one he said that looked most like him i
[36:24] believe all that but i want that to turn
[36:28] into a living life in me
[36:33] i believe all of it
[36:35] i believe it with all my heart
[36:38] i i would dispute with you if you
[36:41] thought it wasn't true
[36:46] i've seen a lot of the people that have
[36:48] fallen away they call everybody else
[36:50] they won't call me
[36:56] because i'm dying in the wool sold out
[36:58] and then they're not going to change me
[37:00] they they know what god did for me
[37:04] and i wouldn't have never
[37:06] believed anything if it wasn't from the
[37:09] voice
[37:10] i didn't even know he was a prophet
[37:13] when i heard his voice i didn't know
[37:14] what he fulfilled i didn't know where he
[37:17] fit in the scripture i didn't know
[37:19] anything about him but i knew one thing
[37:21] when he spoke that was the words of life
[37:26] and it did something to me
[37:29] so he said he said here to prove that
[37:33] his life is in us now the beneficiaries
[37:36] of this life
[37:38] the life there never was a life lived
[37:41] like it
[37:43] he was the son of god
[37:45] and he died
[37:47] and that
[37:48] shut it out
[37:50] but when he raised again from the dead
[37:53] on that easter morning then we as his
[37:56] servants are commissioned by him
[38:00] to go into all the world and bring this
[38:03] good news to every person
[38:06] so he said
[38:08] when when he went into the grave all
[38:10] that life was shut out
[38:13] gone
[38:15] hope you enjoyed
[38:17] he's right in that tune
[38:20] you'll never see him again
[38:22] he's going to rot
[38:24] like everybody else i put
[38:27] in that tomb he's never going to come
[38:29] out of there
[38:31] his words are just going to fail fail
[38:33] away
[38:35] they're just going to fail
[38:37] they're just going to fade away but what
[38:39] happened
[38:40] there was a word prophesied i will not
[38:43] suffer my holy one to seek corruption
[38:48] and he had the power to lay this life
[38:50] down and to take it up again and he
[38:52] rolled that stone back
[38:54] and it came out of there and so we just
[38:57] want to just read this a little bit to
[39:00] set our our place up for this evening
[39:04] and by him the vote the good news to
[39:06] every person
[39:07] that he
[39:09] is a living
[39:11] how can we do it by word
[39:15] only
[39:18] okay so we can't do it by word only
[39:21] that's not what makes them live you see
[39:24] the word has got to transform
[39:28] into flesh so in the beginning if the
[39:30] word was made flesh
[39:33] and dwelt among us
[39:35] and he was a quickening
[39:37] spirit the first adam was a living soul
[39:40] but now he's a quickening spirit so he
[39:42] can make put that life in us
[39:45] and make it come alive
[39:47] and
[39:48] so uh that's where my life is i want
[39:52] that life
[39:54] alive in me
[39:56] not in a demonstration in a service
[40:01] not in a shout not in a song not in a
[40:04] prayer line
[40:06] but i want that life there when i meet
[40:10] the challenges of life that discourage
[40:13] me
[40:14] when i'm in my down time when i'm in my
[40:17] low places
[40:19] that's where i want to find him
[40:22] i want to find them in in the peace
[40:26] i'm not very good with idle time
[40:29] where i just get to those places i don't
[40:31] know where to go i don't know what to do
[40:34] i just feel kind of drifting those are
[40:36] weak times you know the worldly
[40:39] expression the idle mind is the devil's
[40:43] playground those are the times that i
[40:45] want to commune
[40:48] i i want to be
[40:50] closer with him i hate to talk about
[40:52] myself but i just i want it so bad
[40:55] amen amen
[40:58] and and so he speaks here he says
[41:01] you can't do it by word only for it's
[41:03] written the gospel
[41:05] came not
[41:06] by word only but through the power
[41:09] and the manifestation of the holy spirit
[41:14] to prove that he's alive now that's the
[41:17] gospel
[41:19] so the end which is the word of god
[41:22] which is what he's desiring for us to
[41:25] want to achieve to he doesn't want us to
[41:28] sit back
[41:30] and hope
[41:31] that what we believe is going to carry
[41:34] us through
[41:35] no he wants you to be
[41:37] living
[41:40] fruit
[41:42] of his spirit
[41:45] every one of us now this is what he says
[41:48] now
[41:49] if there is another gospel
[41:51] as paul spoke
[41:53] to one of the groups
[41:56] i am surprised that you've turned to
[41:59] another gospel
[42:01] which there is no other
[42:04] but a make-believe
[42:06] gospel
[42:07] in a denominational fiction
[42:11] turning from the good news so if we
[42:14] understand that there's another gospel
[42:18] that's what he said who where did you
[42:20] get this other gospel from okay i didn't
[42:23] know there was another gospel well the
[42:26] other gospel is being
[42:28] sowed if it's a seed of discrepancy
[42:32] there's somebody else out there
[42:35] sowing a gospel
[42:38] that's not the original word of god
[42:42] it's
[42:42] contrary it it's different
[42:46] it's it it meets all of the definitions
[42:49] it's not
[42:50] what
[42:51] was the purpose of what was to be
[42:55] uh
[42:56] uh uh brought like he said it's a
[42:59] denominational fiction and so we've got
[43:02] to realize and this is my point tonight
[43:06] is we've got to understand that there is
[43:08] another sower out there and he's at work
[43:15] now we know where the battleground is
[43:18] it's in our mind so the sower is out
[43:21] there always
[43:23] trying to sow
[43:25] something
[43:26] contrary
[43:29] and we've got to be aware of it
[43:32] you know we just we can't
[43:35] just think that
[43:37] we're good seed
[43:39] and that there's not this other sower
[43:42] who's suddenly
[43:44] and cunningly
[43:46] even in the night so he's not out in the
[43:50] open but he's sowing little things into
[43:53] our mind little things into our life
[43:56] trying to give us little explanations
[43:59] trying to reason things out in our life
[44:02] and
[44:03] and trying to say little things like
[44:05] that's not important that doesn't matter
[44:09] that really
[44:11] doesn't do it i i remember that
[44:14] the reason that this all came to me but
[44:16] i remember the time
[44:19] when we lived in flagstaff and we first
[44:22] came there and and all the sisters and
[44:25] everybody were we were just kind of
[44:27] fresh out of the world
[44:30] so nobody really had super long hair
[44:33] so they all come up with this idea that
[44:36] if you would just trim the ends off of
[44:38] it it would grow faster
[44:42] wow well i mean
[44:45] hey
[44:46] let's get long hair as quick as we can
[44:50] you know what i mean and
[44:52] it seemed reasonable you know
[44:55] everybody's clipping away well one day
[44:59] we listened to questions and answers
[45:03] and they were talking about uh brothers
[45:05] branham's children
[45:07] because i guess they cut bangs on
[45:10] themselves
[45:11] but then he said out i would that you
[45:14] wouldn't even lay a pair of scissors
[45:17] now i don't know what
[45:20] anybody else heard
[45:22] that's right
[45:24] you understand but i know as for me and
[45:27] my house
[45:29] we we accepted the word of the lord
[45:32] we took it as the word of the lord
[45:35] and that's another discrepancy well he
[45:37] didn't say thus saith the lord
[45:43] be followers of me
[45:45] as i am of christ you can't separate the
[45:48] messenger
[45:50] from the messi
[45:52] you understand he was a light he was an
[45:55] example of the scripture i believe paul
[45:57] said i am an example of you you to you
[46:00] you know what i mean so there there was
[46:02] a a part of us that got anchored into
[46:06] even though we didn't understand it
[46:09] but it was spoken and we we begin to
[46:12] hear all these little
[46:15] discrepancies all these little things
[46:18] that were sowed
[46:20] you know and
[46:22] some of them we didn't have answers for
[46:26] you know we we just
[46:28] uh we just would have to to pray and
[46:31] read and wait till we we heard something
[46:35] you know and and so many of those little
[46:38] things uh begin to
[46:40] uh
[46:41] come up
[46:42] and and we begin to realize that there
[46:44] was little things that were being sold
[46:48] little uh
[46:49] ways of thinking little ways of
[46:52] approaches the little understandings you
[46:55] know
[46:57] just all these little things that began
[47:00] to be sold and and the purpose of those
[47:03] things
[47:04] was to
[47:06] affect
[47:10] our witness
[47:12] of making the word of god alive
[47:19] and so
[47:20] i'd like to
[47:22] read this paragraph of the seed of
[47:24] discrepancy
[47:26] it's paragraph 50. so
[47:28] we've got a
[47:30] purpose
[47:31] right and that's to prove he's alive
[47:35] okay so we and so
[47:38] we've got to understand that there's
[47:40] something that we've got to stand for
[47:43] and possess to have it
[47:46] and so if we would read this statement
[47:48] it says now we find today
[47:52] that this discrepancy
[47:55] has been sowed through every
[47:58] age
[48:00] right so we know what we know what this
[48:03] discrepancy
[48:04] is
[48:05] it's it is sowing discord
[48:09] being contrary
[48:11] sowing discord something different or
[48:13] being contrary to what's already been
[48:17] so the sa this enemy just from the very
[48:21] first day
[48:22] when satan
[48:24] spoke to adam and eve it was surely you
[48:28] won't die
[48:30] that was that seed of discrepancy
[48:32] contrary to the word of god that seed is
[48:35] still being sowed today now we find
[48:38] today that this discrepancy has been
[48:40] sowed through every age
[48:42] if it's possible to get
[48:45] it in the next 10 or 15 minutes i i
[48:48] would do it
[48:50] but you can't down through the ages
[48:54] we
[48:55] are all most all of us read the bible
[48:58] and now like when jesus come and found
[49:02] that discrepancy discrepancy contrary he
[49:06] was the word made manifest
[49:09] he was god's
[49:11] interpretation of the word
[49:14] because he said search the scriptures
[49:17] for in them you think you have eternal
[49:20] life but they are which testify of me
[49:27] there you are
[49:28] he was the interpretation of the word
[49:33] and every
[49:35] born-again son and daughter of god
[49:39] of this age is the interpretation
[49:44] of the word
[49:45] you are
[49:47] written
[49:48] epistles
[49:50] read of all men
[49:53] okay so that that's what it is now
[49:57] you've got another sower
[50:01] with another gospel
[50:04] and he wants his crop to come up
[50:07] he wants his gospel
[50:10] to be witnessed
[50:13] he wants to manifest
[50:15] what he's sowing
[50:18] so
[50:19] he's going to sow
[50:21] something contrary
[50:24] because if he can get something contrary
[50:28] into our lives now they're reading
[50:31] something different
[50:33] than the full picture
[50:39] you're living
[50:41] a different
[50:42] gospel
[50:44] and that's what his desire is
[50:48] okay
[50:49] his desire is for us to testify of his
[50:53] kingdom
[50:55] to give him some form of credence
[50:58] so if he if if
[51:01] he believes satan's lie
[51:04] as god's truth
[51:06] so when he says and satan appears as
[51:09] what
[51:11] an angel of light
[51:13] look he he comes and he sows
[51:16] discrepancies he sows things in the word
[51:19] of god
[51:20] that aren't true he gives you
[51:22] justifications
[51:24] for things that the unction of your
[51:27] spirit
[51:28] tells you not to do
[51:31] he's a sower
[51:32] he's always trying to find he's trying
[51:35] to find something he can put in your
[51:38] life because the purpose of him doing
[51:40] that if he can sow anything in it's
[51:45] going to keep us from achieving
[51:48] what it is that we're desiring to
[51:51] achieve
[51:55] so you can't you can't
[51:57] you can't
[51:58] uh
[51:59] not take heed of him
[52:04] every time you reach a valley of
[52:06] decision or every time you're seeking
[52:09] for more of god he is there
[52:13] trying to sow
[52:15] something
[52:16] there there's another sower
[52:19] and he's at work
[52:21] and he's trying to sow discrepancy
[52:25] something contrary just put a spin
[52:30] on something
[52:32] you know america don't take it at face
[52:35] value this is what he meant this is what
[52:38] he said
[52:39] look at this it can and so you've got to
[52:42] come down to your heart when you begin
[52:44] to think these things you've got to pray
[52:46] through them and begin to realize does
[52:49] this really help me manifest what my
[52:52] goal is
[52:54] i'll tell you one of the worst things
[52:58] is gossip
[53:04] i don't see any of my gossipers here
[53:09] oh we've got them
[53:13] we've got them
[53:15] and gossip is discrepancy
[53:17] and discrepancy kills the life of the
[53:20] church
[53:23] it's amazing
[53:26] who all stayed away
[53:29] they know
[53:31] they know in their spirit
[53:37] they they know
[53:40] they know
[53:41] what it does
[53:45] but it's become so part of tradition
[53:49] that you've got to talk about everything
[53:51] well guess what tradition will not get
[53:53] you into heaven
[53:56] there's only one thing that gets you in
[53:58] heaven and that's the love of god shed
[54:00] abroad in your heart
[54:02] by the holy spirit
[54:04] so you we've got you've got to
[54:06] understand that that these things are
[54:09] are are
[54:10] are he he's coming in
[54:13] and and so he wants to come in and he
[54:16] wants to start sowing all this stuff
[54:21] and you know what you do with the seed
[54:23] of the enemy
[54:25] you don't plant it
[54:27] you don't try to put it in a special pot
[54:30] you don't water it
[54:33] you don't have anything to do with it
[54:36] you walk away from it you start talking
[54:39] about somebody and you say gossip is not
[54:42] a lie
[54:45] gossip is a spirit
[54:47] and you can gossip the truth
[54:51] and end up in hell
[54:55] see we just got to the place that we
[54:57] think that we're untouchable
[55:02] you know we can't do anything wrong
[55:04] we're so predestinated
[55:06] that you know our names on the lamb's
[55:08] book of life well you've got to remember
[55:11] these things when you start seeing these
[55:13] shortcomings in your life you better see
[55:16] that's god letting you know that you
[55:18] might need to find the place that you're
[55:20] supposed to be
[55:22] you might supposed to find the fountain
[55:24] that cleanses you from all
[55:26] unrighteousness
[55:28] but but don't tell me that you're going
[55:30] to be cutting your hair you've been
[55:32] putting on all these powders and
[55:34] everything you're going to be putting on
[55:36] high heels be putting on all kinds of
[55:38] tight clothes and everything and think
[55:41] that your name's in the lamb's book of
[55:43] life i'm not saying it's not in the
[55:45] lamb's book of life but you're not
[55:48] manifesting that
[55:50] in the lamb's book of life if you'll be
[55:52] destroyed by fire
[55:59] that you could be saved
[56:01] i don't want that to i don't want to be
[56:03] unfruitful
[56:06] want to be fruitful
[56:11] and if jesus predicted this paragraph 63
[56:15] and if jesus predicted this age to end
[56:18] up
[56:19] in the greatest discrepancy
[56:22] that ever was
[56:24] the lady of seeing church age
[56:28] something that is completely
[56:30] contrary
[56:33] and
[56:34] in adversity
[56:36] with the truth
[56:38] blind miserable poor wretched and naked
[56:41] and don't know it don't even know
[56:43] they're gossiping oh sister such and
[56:45] such and she did this and
[56:48] brother such and said
[56:55] you know
[56:56] and men can gossip too
[57:00] i think we call it with women we call it
[57:03] gossip with men we call it backbiting
[57:09] same
[57:10] spirit trying to kill
[57:14] what influence so you've got to
[57:15] understand these things aren't hurting
[57:17] nobody but yourself
[57:21] so if you have a desire to go
[57:24] further
[57:25] then you've got to realize wait a minute
[57:28] i cannot let this sower get anything
[57:31] planted in my life because a root of
[57:35] bitterness will defile many.
[57:39] he says the
[57:40] lady of cnh lukewarm
[57:43] that put him out of the church
[57:45] how can it be anything else but
[57:49] discrepancy
[57:50] certainly it is
[57:53] he said
[57:55] it is it the ends
[57:58] it ends in that age
[58:01] so discrepancy is going to end in this
[58:05] age
[58:07] how's it going to end it's going to end
[58:10] in the believer
[58:12] that's right it's going to have a place
[58:14] that it will not be sowed it will not be
[58:18] taken
[58:19] that it comes to a place where there's a
[58:22] people that will not receive his seed
[58:25] you know that's what the prophet of god
[58:26] taught there would be a new bride
[58:28] there'd be a new eve and she would not
[58:31] take his seed
[58:39] wow
[58:41] man i can actually get to that place
[58:44] wow
[58:45] i didn't even deem it was possible
[58:48] i thought i was going to have to
[58:49] struggle with this flesh i thought i was
[58:52] going to have to struggle with this
[58:53] weakness i thought i was going to have
[58:55] to go through these ups and downs and
[58:57] ins and outs all my life but now i'm
[59:00] realizing there's a s-u-n s-o-n that's
[59:04] shiny there's someone here that came to
[59:06] rise me up and bring me to a higher
[59:09] place where i'm not going to take that
[59:11] seed it's not going to be in my harvest
[59:19] he said it was cain and abel again on
[59:21] calvary
[59:23] now notice as is that on the board okay
[59:25] good
[59:26] now notice as
[59:28] ever as ever as soon as jesus went away
[59:33] and went into heaven
[59:35] the holy spirit was sent back
[59:38] that was the seed
[59:41] the life giver unto the word as we spoke
[59:45] last night
[59:46] it's the one that quickens the word
[59:50] quicken means bring to life
[59:54] the genuine holy spirit only brings to
[59:58] life
[1:00:00] the word
[1:00:01] that it is
[1:00:04] the holy spirit only brings to life the
[1:00:08] word
[1:00:09] that
[1:00:10] it is
[1:00:11] won't bring
[1:00:13] a creed to life
[1:00:15] it can't because it's nothing of the
[1:00:18] creed
[1:00:19] it is the life of the word of god for it
[1:00:23] is god see and it quickens that body
[1:00:27] now so why would satan want to be able
[1:00:31] to sow a seed of discrepancy in you
[1:00:34] because god cannot bring that to life
[1:00:38] he can't bear witness of that so now
[1:00:42] you've got something in your life that's
[1:00:44] contrary to the word of god and he can't
[1:00:47] quicken it he can't bring it to life he
[1:00:50] can't he can't put his a
[1:00:53] seal
[1:00:56] of approval on it
[1:00:58] he's got to stand back and say this
[1:01:01] person is not truly representing me
[1:01:10] okay and and i know
[1:01:13] i i watch it i i don't understand it i i
[1:01:16] i want to be gentle i want to be kind
[1:01:20] i i understand we battle in the flesh
[1:01:23] but many times we'll see people come to
[1:01:25] church after their clothes will be so
[1:01:27] tight
[1:01:29] and they're wearing high heels
[1:01:31] and the only thing i can think is
[1:01:34] they've not heard it
[1:01:39] but i know i've preached it
[1:01:43] so there's got to be a discrepancy
[1:01:47] you understand somebody sowed a seed of
[1:01:52] reasoning
[1:01:53] and they're filtering it through that
[1:01:56] reasoning and therefore they're not
[1:01:58] manifesting the life in fact they're
[1:02:01] actually sitting there walking contrary
[1:02:05] to the word of god an affront
[1:02:10] right in the face of god
[1:02:14] i've done it
[1:02:17] but i realized wait a minute
[1:02:19] i got to stop the sower
[1:02:24] i've got to stop the sower i've got to
[1:02:27] get them
[1:02:28] right at the seed
[1:02:31] i can't let it plant i can't let it grow
[1:02:34] i can't let it gain root because now
[1:02:37] if you're the manifester
[1:02:40] of the seed now you're manifesting the
[1:02:43] seed of discrepancy
[1:02:49] like all these woman preachers
[1:02:53] we know that when a woman cuts her hair
[1:02:55] it's a sign
[1:02:57] of authority
[1:03:00] it's her claim to spiritual leadership
[1:03:04] i'm spiritual
[1:03:06] the word of god says not to cut my hair
[1:03:08] but i'm i'm above that
[1:03:11] i've got spiritual leadership i will
[1:03:14] interpret to you what he meant
[1:03:20] oh i thought oh short hair is down to
[1:03:22] your shoulders
[1:03:24] well when you have hair down your back
[1:03:25] i'm talking about myself
[1:03:30] i didn't want to cut my hair
[1:03:32] i was believing the message but i was
[1:03:34] from the wrong side of the fence
[1:03:38] let it grow long i don't how long was
[1:03:40] yours jax did you ever have long hair
[1:03:42] oh you look sweet
[1:03:48] but
[1:03:50] you understand
[1:03:51] but when i so i thought i i i'll cut my
[1:03:54] hair i cut it short
[1:03:56] i even had a discrepancy for it
[1:04:00] just pull your head over your shoulder
[1:04:01] and cut it off
[1:04:03] and i had a nazarite vow
[1:04:07] i didn't realize that all the other
[1:04:09] nazarites i were hanging out with were
[1:04:11] smoking drinking less than doing all
[1:04:14] this other stuff in the world no
[1:04:15] nazarite bowen now the nazarite vows the
[1:04:18] heart
[1:04:19] i had to get rid of that seed of
[1:04:20] discrepancy i had to get rid of i could
[1:04:23] look to a messenger
[1:04:25] and see an example
[1:04:28] i could listen to what he said what he
[1:04:31] said about the beatles what he he said
[1:04:33] about these these uh
[1:04:36] he called duck tales wasn't that what it
[1:04:38] was murdered him though he did them
[1:04:40] ducktale haircuts and all that that
[1:04:43] stuff they had i could hear the word and
[1:04:45] what was the word doing it was pulling
[1:04:48] that seed of discrepancy out of me so
[1:04:51] now i was no longer as long as i had
[1:04:54] that hair i really wasn't a true
[1:04:58] representation
[1:04:59] of the true gospel
[1:05:01] i was living a denominational fiction
[1:05:05] it was my fiction
[1:05:07] but that's what i was living we need
[1:05:09] people that have the guts
[1:05:13] i don't care who it is to say that's not
[1:05:16] what the word of god said i don't care
[1:05:19] about their explanation i don't care
[1:05:21] they think that they're spiritual enough
[1:05:26] and they've got leadership enough
[1:05:28] i used to think i had a hotline to god
[1:05:31] me and god just pick up the phone and
[1:05:33] talk to god
[1:05:34] i could do anything i want
[1:05:37] yeah that's till i heard somebody that
[1:05:39] really did talk to him
[1:05:44] i found out i had the wrong number
[1:05:50] you know what i mean
[1:05:53] i mean you've got to come to the place
[1:05:55] that you've got an absolute
[1:05:58] and nothing because you're not going to
[1:06:00] let anything be sold contrary to it no
[1:06:03] matter how pretty it is no matter how
[1:06:06] good it sounds no matter if you think it
[1:06:08] and the worst discrepancy is the one you
[1:06:11] come up with yourself
[1:06:19] because he doesn't stand behind creeds
[1:06:22] now notice as they did then as the bible
[1:06:25] said and john spoke to his children said
[1:06:28] little children ye have heard
[1:06:31] of the antichrist which was to come into
[1:06:35] the world
[1:06:36] and which already is in the world and is
[1:06:39] working in the children of disobedience
[1:06:44] so that's the first sign of discrepancy
[1:06:46] is disobedience to the word let me tell
[1:06:50] you
[1:06:51] discrepancy brings god's wrath
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] i'm not saying you're lost
[1:07:02] but you might end up on your bed
[1:07:04] somewhere with cancer looking up at the
[1:07:06] ceiling till god can
[1:07:08] finally get you to a place
[1:07:10] i say
[1:07:12] let's don't fool with it
[1:07:15] how many wants to go to higher ground
[1:07:17] how many wants to be more spiritual how
[1:07:19] many wants to have more of the love of
[1:07:21] god and the power of god not everybody's
[1:07:23] a testifier not everybody can witness
[1:07:26] but i'll tell you how many people that
[1:07:28] our messenger say that that person
[1:07:30] praying that person that gave that in
[1:07:32] words of encouragement that person that
[1:07:34] brought you here
[1:07:36] there's a lot of ways god can speak
[1:07:39] believe me it's not in word only so what
[1:07:42] does that do have a preacher that's
[1:07:44] preached and preached the gospel if it's
[1:07:46] never manifested in the flesh
[1:07:52] and it's not manifested in the flesh in
[1:07:54] his life it needs to be manifested in
[1:07:57] the flesh of the people he's preaching
[1:08:00] to to prove that his words are the
[1:08:02] gospel
[1:08:04] that's why we know this messenger was
[1:08:07] the gospel because it's proved in us
[1:08:09] because every truth son and daughter of
[1:08:12] god is the interpretation of the word of
[1:08:15] god
[1:08:20] he says now as long as there's
[1:08:23] he says the children of disobedience now
[1:08:25] that was
[1:08:26] long about 30 years after the coming of
[1:08:29] the holy ghost
[1:08:30] we find when the holy ghost come
[1:08:33] the real seed the real life giver to the
[1:08:37] seed then here comes that discrepancy in
[1:08:40] again
[1:08:41] and notice
[1:08:43] on it went
[1:08:45] the real word had been vindicated
[1:08:48] them prophets of old had vindicated the
[1:08:51] word of god to be true
[1:08:53] and as they went down
[1:08:55] if
[1:08:56] anybody ever read
[1:08:59] the nicaea council
[1:09:01] or the pre nicaea council
[1:09:04] then 15 days of bloody politics
[1:09:07] when they bunch of romans
[1:09:10] down there wanted to bring in and make a
[1:09:13] denomination
[1:09:15] out of that church
[1:09:17] prophets came in wrapped in sheepskin
[1:09:19] eating herbs
[1:09:21] and stood
[1:09:22] for that word but what did it do
[1:09:25] they had to be like cain
[1:09:29] it had to be
[1:09:31] like abel
[1:09:33] one had to die
[1:09:39] do you understand
[1:09:41] one's got to die billy
[1:09:45] you understand i want the sea
[1:09:47] disprepancy to die
[1:09:51] i don't want to be reasoning i don't
[1:09:53] want to be coming up with excuses i
[1:09:56] don't want to be coming up with programs
[1:09:58] i want to be resolved in my spirit
[1:10:03] that this is the rising of the sun this
[1:10:07] is the true light of god's word
[1:10:10] this is the truth there's many voices
[1:10:13] but
[1:10:14] as he even said i am the voice of god to
[1:10:17] you i know you resent that
[1:10:21] he said but i am the voice of god to you
[1:10:26] not oh this is what he meant or i've got
[1:10:28] the spirit or he was this and he didn't
[1:10:31] know this and he didn't know that let me
[1:10:34] tell you something
[1:10:36] jesus's gospel
[1:10:39] was not subject to technology
[1:10:46] it was eternal life
[1:10:48] and it works today
[1:10:50] just like it worked back then in fact
[1:10:53] our prophet told us that if he ever got
[1:10:55] it where they get to that place of
[1:10:57] technology they can produce that voice
[1:11:00] today
[1:11:03] i think it would sound real familiar
[1:11:13] one had to die
[1:11:16] certainly it did
[1:11:17] and the word lost its influence amongst
[1:11:22] the people
[1:11:24] now
[1:11:27] let me just finish reading this
[1:11:29] because i want to just jump right there
[1:11:31] and take off and i'm going to let you go
[1:11:33] certainly it did
[1:11:35] and the word lost its influence amongst
[1:11:37] the people and they all voted out the
[1:11:40] true word
[1:11:42] and took in dogmas of discrepancy of the
[1:11:45] early catholic church
[1:11:47] they added a pope
[1:11:49] they added a bishop
[1:11:51] they added this that and the other they
[1:11:54] taken away the real true meaning of
[1:11:56] peter
[1:11:59] and of mary
[1:12:01] and all the rest of it what they do made
[1:12:03] her the mother of god they never
[1:12:05] understood she was an incubator
[1:12:09] they made jesus
[1:12:11] part
[1:12:13] a human
[1:12:14] which is sin
[1:12:16] and there was no sin found in him
[1:12:19] therefore there was no mary
[1:12:21] found in him
[1:12:24] the rest of it
[1:12:25] and made idols
[1:12:27] and made nothing but just a pagan
[1:12:30] ceremony out of the so-called christian
[1:12:33] religion
[1:12:35] statues to this lightened candles to
[1:12:37] that
[1:12:38] he says what was it the seed of
[1:12:41] discrepancy
[1:12:42] and organized and organized for the
[1:12:45] first time on earth a church
[1:12:47] what is it that seed of discrepancy
[1:12:51] which started sowing something adding to
[1:12:55] and taking away
[1:12:58] the same seed is still doing what is
[1:13:02] satan trying to do add and take and
[1:13:05] intake
[1:13:11] it's so easy
[1:13:13] to not even realize
[1:13:16] that you're almost daring god
[1:13:21] i can get away with this
[1:13:24] well
[1:13:26] i want to get rid of that thing
[1:13:29] i don't want that guy sitting say well
[1:13:32] he's full of mercy
[1:13:34] he won't throw you out
[1:13:36] no i want to say no
[1:13:38] i don't want it i don't want it in my
[1:13:41] heart i don't want it in my mind i don't
[1:13:44] want it in my being that's not the kind
[1:13:46] of person i want to be i want to be like
[1:13:49] him
[1:13:52] you say this is awful strange for you
[1:13:54] preaching like this
[1:13:56] after being in the message 50 years
[1:14:00] well i'll tell you something 50 years
[1:14:02] don't mean nothing
[1:14:03] there's only one thing that means
[1:14:05] anything and that's one minute with
[1:14:07] jesus christ
[1:14:14] a pagan ceremony first time on earth
[1:14:17] something attitude is taken away whoever
[1:14:20] heard in the bible of not eating meat on
[1:14:23] friday
[1:14:25] whoever heard in the bible of anything
[1:14:27] of sprinkling instead of baptizing
[1:14:30] immersing whoever heard of those things
[1:14:34] a hail mary or something whoever heard
[1:14:37] of some of this rotten tommy rod of
[1:14:41] these protestants too
[1:14:43] pot can't call the kettle greasy right
[1:14:46] just guilty of the least is guilty of
[1:14:50] the
[1:14:51] whole
[1:14:52] whoever heard of god ever dealing in an
[1:14:55] organization show me one time
[1:14:59] that one organization ever
[1:15:02] stayed alive
[1:15:04] it died immediately
[1:15:06] and never did rise again it's that time
[1:15:10] it's time that something takes place
[1:15:14] it's time for a god to move
[1:15:17] it killed the influence amongst the
[1:15:20] people
[1:15:22] that's what the seed of discrepancy does
[1:15:26] you get a lady that comes in and she's
[1:15:28] dressed like a oscar meyer
[1:15:33] she's killed the influence of the gospel
[1:15:38] you get someone who's
[1:15:41] clipping away
[1:15:43] it's killing the influence
[1:15:45] it kills the influence of the gospel
[1:15:49] right here in this building because
[1:15:52] they're preaching a different gospel
[1:15:55] than the gospel of jesus christ
[1:15:58] it's the seed of discrepancy at work
[1:16:02] trying to kill the influence it doesn't
[1:16:06] matter is what they're saying
[1:16:10] i can do this and still be blessed of
[1:16:13] god
[1:16:16] well end up with that cancer living in
[1:16:18] your body
[1:16:21] end up with that mental problem
[1:16:26] end up with the nervous breakdown
[1:16:30] if you're bold enough
[1:16:34] come right up and say i don't have to
[1:16:38] obey i will offer a
[1:16:41] better
[1:16:42] sacrifice
[1:16:45] i will sing like an angel
[1:16:47] i will do good works i will do all those
[1:16:50] things if that's god doesn't want
[1:16:52] sacrifice he wants righteousness to flow
[1:16:55] like a river he desires obedience above
[1:16:58] sacrifice
[1:17:02] it's a seed of discrepancy but you see
[1:17:05] what it's doing is it's killing
[1:17:10] the influence of the gospel
[1:17:21] that's what he does
[1:17:23] what spirit killed the gospel
[1:17:28] cain he wanted to have a different
[1:17:31] sacrifice a different life and so he
[1:17:34] killed
[1:17:38] the true gospel
[1:17:39] and when the seed of discrepancy
[1:17:43] comes and those things start to grow in
[1:17:45] our life it kills our influence
[1:17:48] and it kills the influence of the gospel
[1:17:51] and when you kill influence that means
[1:17:53] it's murder
[1:17:55] murder
[1:17:58] well we don't want to be guilty of
[1:18:00] murdering the influence of a gospel into
[1:18:03] someone's life that really needs it
[1:18:05] your children
[1:18:07] your daughters your sons
[1:18:12] you gotta we just can't let that stuff
[1:18:14] get in we can't let the gossip get in
[1:18:18] we can't let the talking of one another
[1:18:20] get in the
[1:18:22] uh talking about those things which are
[1:18:24] done in darkness it's a shame to talk
[1:18:27] about those things but don't you see
[1:18:29] what it's doing don't you see what this
[1:18:31] discrepancy is doing it's killing the
[1:18:34] influence of the gospel right in a body
[1:18:37] the gospel will lose its influence and
[1:18:39] will won't have the power of the
[1:18:42] resurrection moving in our life because
[1:18:45] the seed of discrepancy is sucking the
[1:18:48] life out of it
[1:18:54] that's the truth
[1:18:58] now i don't want to call things out
[1:19:03] i may have to make some personal visits
[1:19:07] james said
[1:19:09] the tongue
[1:19:11] is a wicked weapon
[1:19:13] hard to bridle
[1:19:15] can sweet
[1:19:16] and bitterness proceed from the same
[1:19:18] fountain
[1:19:22] but see
[1:19:23] they don't realize
[1:19:27] that is the spirit
[1:19:29] of cain
[1:19:30] killing the influence
[1:19:33] of the truth
[1:19:36] that and so when we present another
[1:19:39] gospel
[1:19:41] we're presenting a fiction
[1:19:43] to people as it's the truth
[1:19:48] they preach it as the gospel truth
[1:19:51] and then god turns them over
[1:19:54] and sears their conscience
[1:19:58] and turns them over to a reprobate mind
[1:20:01] and they don't even know what happened
[1:20:02] to him
[1:20:04] it was all those little anti
[1:20:07] things and all those little personal
[1:20:09] uh viewpoints and all those little
[1:20:12] decisions they make and i know the
[1:20:14] gospel i know the holy ghost i know i
[1:20:17] can do this i do this i can take
[1:20:19] authority i can teach
[1:20:24] we got a world full
[1:20:26] of of
[1:20:28] you know
[1:20:30] i don't know what kind of preachers they
[1:20:32] are i want to say woman preachers but i
[1:20:33] don't even think they know they're women
[1:20:35] nobody knows what a woman is nowadays it
[1:20:37] gets so bad
[1:20:39] praise god we got real godly women that
[1:20:42] live by the god's word and are anointed
[1:20:46] by the holy ghost
[1:20:47] and are shining their light so it killed
[1:20:50] the influence amongst the people
[1:20:53] and it kills the influence that's cain
[1:20:56] same thing has been done today they
[1:20:59] killed the influence saying that bunch
[1:21:02] of holy rollers is nothing to them
[1:21:05] why is discrepancy
[1:21:08] meant
[1:21:09] the faith word face to face
[1:21:12] and see what it is see if god interprets
[1:21:17] his own word
[1:21:18] god's able of these stones
[1:21:21] to raise up children
[1:21:23] to abraham
[1:21:25] so i really
[1:21:27] am saying this as a pastor who desires
[1:21:31] for his flock
[1:21:33] and himself
[1:21:35] i can't go to higher ground
[1:21:40] if i don't take my flock with me
[1:21:46] you understand the only thing i can do
[1:21:49] is is okay if if if they can't go then
[1:21:53] it's a matter of life or death for me
[1:21:56] then i'll go on but
[1:21:59] but i don't want to leave anybody behind
[1:22:02] the seed of abraham doesn't lead seed of
[1:22:04] abraham behind we don't leave our
[1:22:06] children behind
[1:22:08] we don't leave our loved ones behind
[1:22:11] we're we're going to claim every one of
[1:22:12] them
[1:22:14] but what we've all each all of us i have
[1:22:17] to do it you have to do it you've got to
[1:22:20] be aware
[1:22:22] of the other seller
[1:22:24] you got to recognize them
[1:22:27] in the field and you've got to
[1:22:29] understand
[1:22:30] just like you teenagers one of the
[1:22:32] things you got to fight is music
[1:22:35] you know what i mean you got you got to
[1:22:37] fight these fashions you got to fight
[1:22:39] these things they'll kill you
[1:22:41] that's right
[1:22:43] do you understand you've got to fight
[1:22:45] we're we're
[1:22:46] we're a multi-racial
[1:22:48] uh uh
[1:22:50] congregation congregation
[1:22:52] we have to deal with attractions
[1:22:54] you understand it and and and we know
[1:22:57] for a fact that we we don't mix
[1:23:00] our races together because god created
[1:23:03] them to be kept pure within themselves
[1:23:06] that's not anything to do with prejudice
[1:23:10] that's not anything to do with nothing
[1:23:12] it's life
[1:23:14] you have a better life if you don't go
[1:23:17] that route
[1:23:20] you know what i mean it's no one's
[1:23:21] better than anyone else all of us are
[1:23:23] sinners saved by grace
[1:23:27] but those are all the things that he's
[1:23:29] sowing discrepancy he's telling all
[1:23:32] these lies he's trying to sow all these
[1:23:34] seeds get your absolute down
[1:23:38] get it anchored in your soul
[1:23:41] the absolute of god where let no
[1:23:43] bitterness no wrath let none of these
[1:23:45] things proceed from your mouth live a
[1:23:48] holy life before god praying looking up
[1:23:51] for your redemption draw off night
[1:23:53] understanding we're in the biggest
[1:23:55] discrepancy of ever and we've got to not
[1:23:57] let anything be sowed in our life
[1:24:01] amen so god bless you pray for me this
[1:24:04] weekend in missouri that the lord would
[1:24:06] move mightily
[1:24:08] amongst the people and give them what
[1:24:10] they need that the church would help god
[1:24:12] would give them direction on on how to
[1:24:15] find a pastor
[1:24:16] and as you know not that i'm capable or
[1:24:19] have any ability but brother brown asked
[1:24:21] me to help him
[1:24:23] and i i owe it to him for all the years
[1:24:26] of friendship
[1:24:27] and he passed that message to some of
[1:24:29] those brothers so
[1:24:31] we just meet with them periodically and
[1:24:34] discuss
[1:24:36] things that are transparent so pray that
[1:24:38] god keeps us
[1:24:40] in his word do you love him amen let's
[1:24:43] stand together
[1:24:45] [Applause]
[1:24:48] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:24:50] prayer and
[1:24:53] maybe you could have some
[1:24:56] deep sincerity in your heart
[1:24:59] and if you don't know the lord and you
[1:25:00] haven't been touched by the lord

[1:37:11] smith says amen
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:21] i appreciate that
[1:37:23] uh in our prayer time this week let's
[1:37:25] try to remember
[1:37:26] our governor abbott he uh being
[1:37:29] diagnosed with cold but
[1:37:31] i think
[1:37:33] we've had a lot of liberties because of
[1:37:35] his uh
[1:37:36] his stand and his decisions and he's
[1:37:38] been a blessing to us so uh we have
[1:37:41] access to the to the throne room of
[1:37:43] heaven we can just
[1:37:46] just breathe this prayer
[1:37:47] you know the
[1:37:48] atonement of calvary was
[1:37:50] it was a dual atonement
[1:37:52] healing and salvation
[1:37:55] a lot of people get
[1:37:57] the benefits of the healing
[1:37:59] because he said that was
[1:38:01] pretty much unconditional it was the law
[1:38:02] of god
[1:38:04] but those that
[1:38:05] get the benefit of salvation
[1:38:09] i think we have a greater audience
[1:38:12] because we are his children
[1:38:15] he's our heavenly father
[1:38:16] so let's go to him
[1:38:19] gracious lord
[1:38:23] you're a great father lord
[1:38:26] your name is great and greatly to be
[1:38:28] praised
[1:38:29] and tonight lord we
[1:38:31] we thank you lord for the benefits of
[1:38:33] calvary
[1:38:34] of true salvation lord
[1:38:38] and lord we know that
[1:38:41] you spread this message lord he said if
[1:38:43] you love me
[1:38:44] you'll keep my commandments
[1:38:46] so lord we
[1:38:48] we've been advised tonight lord and
[1:38:51] through exhortation and preaching of
[1:38:53] your word lord
[1:38:55] that we need to get back instead get
[1:38:56] back in line
[1:38:58] it's the lord as we
[1:39:01] we take these things upon our hearts
[1:39:02] lords we leave here
[1:39:04] may we go into the deep dark places of
[1:39:06] our hearts and of our lives lord to
[1:39:08] search out those things that would
[1:39:10] hinder your moving prayer is being
[1:39:12] answered
[1:39:14] lord moving up a little higher whatever
[1:39:17] is the next step in life for each one of
[1:39:19] us lord we pray that
[1:39:21] you'd work with us lord work on us
[1:39:24] and lord that we could draw ever closer
[1:39:25] to you for we know the hour is very late
[1:39:28] lord
[1:39:29] lord there's
[1:39:31] been many
[1:39:32] loved ones and friends families that
[1:39:34] have
[1:39:35] preceded us lord
[1:39:38] have made their way across that river
[1:39:43] lord even
[1:39:44] right now lord who have loved ones and
[1:39:46] family members that are
[1:39:48] suffering with grief and loss
[1:39:51] but lord we
[1:39:53] we're thankful that we have a promise
[1:39:55] that
[1:39:56] we'll meet again
[1:39:58] and lord we've
[1:40:01] we've heard
[1:40:02] our prophets say that
[1:40:05] a place just beyond the river
[1:40:07] it's more real than this life
[1:40:10] lord let us realize that lord
[1:40:13] the things in this life lord we think so
[1:40:16] strongly of and we fight against lord
[1:40:19] that
[1:40:20] lord they can be as nothing and lord
[1:40:22] your word can mean everything to us
[1:40:25] lord as we leave from here
[1:40:27] may we go with uplifted hearts and
[1:40:28] spirits lord

[1:40:32] conviction lord

[1:40:36] can bring a sweet peace
[1:40:38] humility lord help us in every way we
[1:40:41] pray
[1:40:42] lord those that are traveling that have
