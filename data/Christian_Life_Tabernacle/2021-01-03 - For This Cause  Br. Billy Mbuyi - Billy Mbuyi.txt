Description:
For This Cause
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Evening Service: January 3,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of your mouth father you spoke to us this morning we receive it in our heart and father we ask tonight even as We Gather Lord that your word may come in such a way that it would answer all the questions and the needs that we have within our heart Lord because that's the source of life and father the scripture says that the word was the light of man it was life and the light of man and and them that receive it to them you've given the power to become Sons and Daughters Lord we come to you Lord and we pray that give it to us once again let us receive of your word for as we eat it we become it Lord bless us bless our fellowship we ask these things in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God bless you tonight amen amen good to be Gather in the house of God let's uh open our Bibles uh we try not going to try to be too long tonight and just a few moments uh uh John chapter 18 we're going to read verse 37 from 37 to let's just start at 37 it says and Bot therefore said unto him how are th King how are thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end I was born for this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my my voice I mean it's very specific to who his subjects were and those that will actually recognize him as king and it says in 38 pilate said unto him what is truth and when he had said to this he went out again unto the Jews and he said unto them I found in him no fault at all amen let's also turn again and uh same uh uh John chapter 12 and verse 27 just one scripture reading it says now my soul is trouble now my soul troubleth and what shall I say father save me from this hour for this cause I came I came unto this hour amen may the Lord add the blessing through the reading of his word you may have your seats let's also turn as you as you seated in first John uh chapter 3 1 John chapter 3 uh we're going to read read from verse 5 it says it says and know ye not and know and know ye and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him and in and in him is no sin whatsoever abideth in him sinth not whatsoever sinth had not sin him neither knoweth him so the the knowledge of sin and the abiding of sin is directly connected to the knowledge of him and he says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even he even as he is righteous and he that committeth sin is is of the is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil amen I just want to for a few moments uh you know I trust that this will directly connect with what our pastor spoke this morning in fact some of the uh quotes or thought that just came directly from what we not not some most of all just came from what we heard this morning uh I just want to speak uh give it a little title and say for this cause for this cause uh you know as Jesus said it we we read here in first John it said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he made that they might destroy the works of the devil so the the manifestation of the Son of God was for the purpose of destroying everything The Works of the enemy because these are two opposing kingdoms and and if he was the son of God and as as the Son of God we accomplish the same thing because we we become part of his kingdom so therefore our purpose is to destroy the works of the enemy our purpose is to manifest light is to become light is to do the things that Christ did is to have that same Spirit within us working the same way I I was thinking you know we we live in a time where knowledge even the scripture tells us that knowledge will increase you you look at technology you look at one man is able to to achieve today it's so high in wisdom and they so high in knowledge rather how that they can take things and and build things and and and use the previous year technology to build upon in order for them to achieve great things but you realize that as you go as we heard this morning that the Church of God was to be functioning by faith and not by knowledge right uh but yet we the the some of the greatest battle we face is is the the the the Battle of knowledge uh we we we no no doubt that often time people are challenged by what they know their understanding of the Bible and and and and and often time it it's amazing because um uh a man can say something and and another come and contradict him using the same Bible but as what what often times happen is one will go and use the writing of such and such and use the writing of such and such which all becomes men's knowledge which all becomes men uh you know one Scripture presented by men in such a way and the other uses the same scripture to present something different and so that's why it becomes so important that that that the that the things of God or the people of God were not made for them to be a knowledge transmitter to just sit around and and even as we heard this morning it just come and debate what the scripture says but but it was made that there becomes a life something that can walk something that can talk something that can express itself something that actually takes the scripture and makes it something to live and and so the and the purpose of the Gospel itself when we talk about the gospel or the good news it was not sent for debate or for for you to go out in the mission field and begin to transmit knowledge to people no it was send in in order to save the lost to heal the sick to manifest the power of God as our pastor quoted Paul this morning it says I didn't come with you to you with enticing knowledge where I can try to persuade you by way of knowledge by what I've studied and understand and show you something that you never seen before well another men will come and show you something different but when somebody comes when the gospel is preached or is brought with power and demonstr ation of the spirit nothing can take it away at that point because why it becomes a Living Word it become the reality of God Walking In the Flesh it becomes what it was what the scripture was spoken it becomes the very interpretation of what the scripture was and no one can take it away so we find out that that's what and often time in getting caught up in these things because that we we have to understand the the the enemy finds by all means a way for us not to obtain what God has in store for us it's he he comes by all means if if it's by sewing confusion if it's by getting you into the debate of knowledge or of understanding of scriptures or comparing scripture to scripture whatever he can do to cause the distraction for him to bring you in such a state where you felt the purpose of you fail to go for the mission that God has sent you that's what he's trying to achieve and I want to say this we we we will send the word of God was given to us for us to fulfill the same mission that Jesus did in fact brother says the church was sent on Earth in order to continue the works of Christ in order for us to save the lost in order for us to heal the sick in order for us to as the scripture says the signs and wonders will follow them that believe it was not sent for great debate or or for people to stand up and just say quote up scriptures and go right and the same people they do that they go right back into the sin that they came from no change at all not nothing that can prove well uh uh that God is walking with them they'll go and and as long as they satisfy uh their conscience as long as they they speak the word and satisfy their conscience as the scripture says they've taken the word of God and made it on non effect they've taken they they've taught uh uh uh uh they've taken the the thoughts of man and the understanding of man and made it the Commandment of God so we find out the the we we could look and he wants to cause destruction and and forget the very Mission and purpose for which we were coming we were sent here to do and and I began to think even about our own selves I could say tonight uh that I gather here that claim to believe the message of the hour often time the other the technique of the enemy will be uh uh to show you once you you've you've given the opportunity to see just how wonderful the beauty the Revelation and and how that God uh brings his word to pass and and the great things the great promises that God has made to us in this age the the the enemy will come and and he begin to work on you and and just to magnify your mistakes and and and show you how that you don't deserve it and and how that you are such a insignificant because I I no one has ever come in the presence of God and not realize that he's a sinner uh the presence of God just how Mighty he is and when he begins to open these things he it brings us to such a place he said this is so great it's it's far beyond what what what I can even understand so he tries to prer in the corner where all you look at is well you know I I'm such and I've done this and and it's amazing even how the devil plays with your mind it it's all it's always the latest mistake that's the greatest you know you you do something and and you you pray and you you try to get over it and and then if you make another mistakes he comes now he moves from the previous one and now it's the next one and and all those things and often time you keep looking down and down and all we come is God Sav we are saved today we are lost tomorrow we come to church we receive the word of God we feel strong by the time Sunday comes again we feel right back where we started the people of God he he wants to keep you in that condition and in that condition he knows he makes you powerless he knows in that condition you can never achieve anything because why you keep looking at the Flesh and you keep looking at this man and working hard to try to perfect him and I'm so thankful how the prophet brings these things in so many other words and so many different I I began to think about the prophet talking about the engine Chief and and how there was a white dog and the black dog and he said within you there are the two but what you need to be doing is to continually feed the white dog so he can be stronger and overcome the other one and that's what we are saying he said for this purpose I came I I didn't come to be defeated I didn't come to just look at my flesh and why because if you look at the flesh you will produce the things of the flesh but oh if you can look at the Spirit that's within you you can say for this purpose even as our Pastor said this morning the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me somebody has to go preach this gospel somebody has to leave what the word is saying somebody has to produce this bride this message what the prophet has spoken and and somebody has to walk it and if there's one person it's me that's right it's not coming up with an attitude where you constantly looking down and you constantly looking at yourself you constantly and he knows in doing so you can never achieve anything that's and and and I'll say this but when I'm talks about this log this log that was in the water and and in the message I believe how can I overcome he talks about it how it it's in the water the very water that produces that that gives life it's in the water it drinks of the water it continue to drinks of the water but yet it's rotten you're like well I if I can just get water well the the the thing about it was the log is supposed to drink water and push out of what the life that he has inside of it it's not supposed to drink water and remain there there has to be a place where after it's drunk the water for it to try to push out the life that's within it so he can produce fruit so we can't be drinking of the word and and drinking of the word and drinking of the word and remaining it and just pointing back to ourselves and back to ourselves somebody's got to hear it and talk about it in fact what God does for us is not even for our own s it it does it for you so you can tell somebody so somebody can receive the same God the scripture says we have been given a Ministry of reconciliation what is the ministry of reconciliation taking man and taking God and bringing them together just like Christ did so we find out in doing so it paralyzes the very faith that we have which is the gift of God it brings you right back into the repentance right back into the circle of repentance and and I receive the Holy Spirit tomorrow I'm not sure if I really receive it and then the next day you come back to the altar he con con continually wants you to stay back in that Circle so we we realize it's the spirit the spirit of God it's not if it's the spirit of God if it's in you it's not said to do anything contrary to what the word of God is wanting to do and I can say this even as our Pastor said this Jesus said the spirit of God is upon me it sent me to bind the broken brokenhearted to to preach the year of of Jubilee and all those things the same spirit of God comes upon us to do the same thing but preach the message what was the Holy Spirit uh sent uh uh given for and and is talking that that it's very important we come to the realization that the same way that God sent Jesus is the same way that he's sending us it's not it's not different he said how did he send him the father who sent him went with him inside of him the father came and he became in the form of the spirit and he dwelt in the Son and the son said I cannot do nothing except what the father is talking to me and he said how is he going to send you he said he does the same exact way he comes in the form of the spirit after he's dead and he goes up and on the day of Pentecost he returns in the form of the spirit to send you exactly like the father send him so he in you can do the works but when him says in the message faith in action he says now Faith is not based upon shifting SS of of men's idea he said uh you couldn't if I came here and told you there was an angel of of the Lord uh that was in the building and these things happened and if I didn't have something to prove to to that to you you you would have the right to doubt it it says and if I said God gave me a gift to do a certain things and you seen it come right back around and fail and fail you would say that's wrong but when it comes right back and God proves it proves it every time to be perfect then that's right God has proved it so that's the way it has to be faith has to have a resting place and and I I just want you to think about what he's saying In This Moment now here's a man here's the word of God saying that God has called us to be Sons and Daughters here's the word of God even the messenger coming to the end time and saying that God has called us to be the very Bride of the end time so we have all those things that we say unless there has to be something by which we can prove that these things which we have read in the Bible are true unless there has to be a way by which some Works some identification something that can show that what the scripture says is true then why should anybody believe it why should anybody believe it because all it is is just men's knowledge men's understanding all it is is just our own claim but oh if you can just look back in your own life what the spirit has done with you how he taken you out of sin and cleanse you and and set you in a place and and he begin to speak to you through the word how is brought the change within your own life then if somebody told you you can say look at my life it's the very testimony that this message or this word is the truth it's the very testimony why because God has not just spoken it but has come back into my life and proven it to be true he says in in a message uh redemption in completeness it says and and here is what going on what's yes is what's what I'm trying to do he says if I want to know why if you want to know why I'm doing this here it says many of you say you never said you never seen me preach in healing campaign and and and it says but it's for a purpose I think and I think I could get souls broken down and come to the altar then I'll find if then I'll find the favor with God in Louisville that's right it says uh it says when there are when when people are ready to get down before God and pray and then and it says and then there are many of you friends that are praying and fasting and and afraid to take hold of what we are praying for it says that's right see it won't do you no good to fast and pray L you've got some Works to go go with it now I want you to get that it won't do you no good to fast and pray unless there are some Works to go with that and then he says all your faith in the world won't do a bit of good L you step right out and toeo toe with it and take it that's right you've got to go forward you've got to step right out and do it anyhow it's like a man I'm Desiring for God to give me a job I'm fasting and praying and I take a seat and I sit there and I don't do right nothing that's not the principle of God but Adam talks about the artisian well it says you can cry out all you want until you become skin and bones and you can shout out oh water I have a crop down here and I want you to come down here it won't do no good but oh if you can follow the principle of God after you you you you prayed and and you set your crop is set up in such a way that when you pray the water will come from up downwards into your crop you can't set your crop up and expect water to flow in a different direction why because it goes the against the very principle of God you can't look for a job and just sit on the chair and expect God to give you a chair a job from your couch you got to stand up and go out and do something it's the same way with the believer we can't claim that God is working within me and just sit at home and somebody's got to speak and somebody's got to test toy about his healing somebody's got to say something somebody's got to come through a place that said if God be real then I want to see him now somebody's got to say I'm taking him at his word and I'm acting and I'm moving forward and I'm speaking I can look foolish that's fine with me but but I'm doing what's in my heart to do and I'll say this show me a man who has no mistake I'll show you a man who has achieved nothing show me a man who has zero mistakes I'll show you a man who has nothing we we get paralyzed well if I do this then it's going to go wrong if I speak they won't believe me it's not even about you to begin with it's about about him it's about his word he has something he wants to achieve he's just looking for a body he's just looking for [Applause] anybody God is Not Looking for our knowledge or understanding of it all he just wants somebody to stand so he can come behind like the Messenger will stand there and and he begin to talk and you're like what is he talking about you know the other day in the meeting you know that such and such people and a person standing right there and you're like Oh my he said but you know I'm waiting for something you know I'm waiting for something what is that that's a man who's got faith because he knew the angel told him to go and stand there and he will stand there however he takes until that angel comes down and prove that were to be true oh and I tell you that angel shut up why because it was a promise that he made to him oh if we can just know that we have an angel who's there behind to make the work to come to pass it says when you ask for anything to get it God said it's yours don't take nothing less get what what you asked for you do you do that and find out how it comes out yeah don't go back and say well I'll take the I'll take sex seconds no don't go out and say well you know I asked and it looks like God is not going to give it to me let him speak to your heart in the everpresent water he says when you when you are saved God gives you Faith to rise from the mark and from the earth your faith overcome the things of the world what is your faith it says your faith is the act that God has did is did it in you to make you a Son of God you quit lying you quit stealing you quit drinking because your faith Rises up above it I I I just want you to understand just even see the language that is putting it something within your heart just Rises up and say this is it I'm done with it something within your heart and Faith you hear the word of God and something Rises up and just say I'm not going to do this anymore and God is there remember God is there to confirm to you that I've done it you know we when we are here our faith even the the the the you know speaks about being saved he says it's our confession when we come and we confess we are saved God will come after our confession to confirm it and when he does the confirmation you know some of us have been saved for 20 30 years and all those those things why why are you still saved because you're continuing to confess it and God is coming right behind it vindicating vindicating it every time how is he vindicating it he's taking away the desires of the world the things that we used to struggle with he he come and put it out and and he does he takes it out he walks with you he shows you continually that you believe my word and I'm here to confirm it to be true he says you quit lying you quit stealing you quit drinking because your faith Rises up above it amen you don't do it you don't have any faith any it says and by faith you saved and that through Grace as much as your faith will release it will will be released that's how much power we can have as much Faith as much as your faith will be released that's as much power we can have because in your dwelling in in you dwells the power that makes the Heaven and the Earth God dwells in you and you are a son and a daughter of God Amen there you are but that's your faith Jesus said according according to your faith be unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible I say unto you if you say unto this mountain be th remove and be and and and don't doubt but believe with all believe what you said in a message the everpresent uh in in everpresent water from the rock it says then what kind of Faith what kind of what kind of people we ought to be we ought we ought to be having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in US it says this Mitten rock that never leaves that never leaves the church it says I'm with you always even in you even even to the end of the world that everpresent great gushing of Salvation and power that pour out from the cross unto the church that ever present present of of the Living God great flowing smart smitten rock that goes with us all our journey Hallelujah it it's not us just walking and and here he is and saying we that's that's what the church is and and often time what we we forget the very purpose for which the church was sent yes sir we forget the the the very purpose for which we were created we were not made to make to make ourselves perfect we were not made to continually take the word and look and just just you know pour it out on me you know today they preach about Sinners you feel like a sinner tomorrow they preach about sinner you feel about Sinner and never coming to the place where you realize I am a son and I'm going to take whatever my position is and walk with it God is looking this is the adoption time the prophet tells us and the adoption is not a different spirit it's the same spirit that births you it's the same spirit that takes you and he walks with you and tutor use until you get to a place where you know that I have been sent here for a purpose for this purpose I came into the world I came for a purpose why that I might reflect the kingdom of my father that I might do the works of God Like Jesus said even like John written and said wrote and said it's it's for this purpose that he might destroy the works of the enemy how are we going to destroy it If all we're looking at is our own selves you know I like that story about that King I'm not sure even if I'm quoting it right who who came and he wanted somebody to ride with him I believe brother Andrew mentioned it a while back he began to look and yes this bunch of generals and soldiers and you know clean clothes and nice haircut and you know Stars just shining he looked at it and he just passed pass pass oh but he saw this man seemed to have been wounded in the war just seemed to have been limping a little bit and just them his uniform was not just as clean as the others and he looked at him and he stopped and he called him off and said he just came from the front line he said that's the guy he wanted to ride with him Jesus didn't didn't have it easy he gave his life he gave everything that he was so he can purchase you we heard it this morning he Li for the sin of the whole world he didn't leave anything out he didn't give a devil a chance he didn't leave him anything he died for everything so that we can come and possess it and walk in it the purpose of Christ was to die so he can annihilate sin but the he was the first M among among many Brethren but he knew when his Brethren will come they will go in and possess the very land that he died for they will continue the battle they will continue in the fight they're not going to walk back and say well you know you know he did it all we don't have anything to do no he wanted us to be courageous to stand firm to take our position and say for this cause if there's one single cause if I can sum up my own life if I could sum up everything I am is for this cause I came into the world but what I'm talks about I I want you to hear this he talks about the blind man who was healed and he says in the message perseverance he said the blind man he says the blind man that I spoke with a while ago he couldn't argue with he says he couldn't argue with theology with them he know nothing about it they could say why so and so and so and so he said I don't know about you theology here is he came before the one that was supposed to be the Masters in Israel they began to question him about theology well you know we are of Moses Moses said in his book and and he said this and this he said I don't know what you guys are talking about I can't answer to that I don't know anything about that but one thing I know is I was blind but now I see what is it it was somebody something happened to him that there's no way you could shut him off why he came in contact with God and there's no way you can shut him off and he came and he said after they've talked about the theology they knew that well you know he can't answer so what do we do with this he said but I have a question for you you call yourself masters and you've educated yourself and all the things and said how is it that I was blind and know I see and this man who heal him you know nothing about him but what them said then they had a real question then they had the real question we get tripped by theology you know you know this word here and you know some now it's no longer the King James we got to go find something else what are we doing oh but if it becomes a life if it's something that I know in my prayer closet in my place where I know I know what was in my heart and I know what it's been changed to there's nobody who can argue against that don't be tripped by theology seek him they told you don't know your Bible he looked they said that that he says that that's okay but I know the author real well why have met him let's know the altor let him walk on us and let him do the works that he said he was going to do on us and let's go out there testify of his great things God is not asked us to testify of something that he didn't do for us he's asking us to only testify of what we have known about him the scripture says we speak that we do know we testify of what we have seen and he says the reason why you don't believe is because you have not received a witness it's because you have not received a witness but if you receive a witness when his testimonies Goes Forth you receive it there's a witness to the testimony there's one that will stand and say I know that God I desire that God it's not you doing something it's him calling his [Music] children and yet we are we are afraid you know we we just cow down and and the devil turn it right back on us and he looks at us and he'll go oh no I'm not he says just find a place to close here we have to communion he speaks about on the day of Pentecost it says those poor people at Pentecost a bunch of fishermen tax collectors and so forth with humble jobs they went up there on the promise of God and they waited up in their Upper Room 10 days and all of the sudden there came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind filled filled all the house where they were they were sitting and then it says they went up into action because that they had seen a promise of God made manifest the propose of Promise is propelling us into action is is bringing God doesn't save you so you can go and brag around how you are saved in fact you know didn't brother tells us that God doesn't heal you just to heal you to show that he can heal he wants something back you want to why am I healing you why am I saving you you you you don't you have to tell him why you want him to save you don't you have to tell him why you want him to heal you it's like that that that Parable the scripture says in the in the the the the Bible how that he gave talents the man who gave the talent the master came back and then he says to him that he gave two he produce another two the three he produces another one but the one who was given a singular said he came back and says I was scared remember I was afraid and I went and hid it now I want you to how beautiful the words that he comes out of his own mouth and he says I know you require that you which you have not given in other words when he was given a talent he knew that an increase will be asked of what was given to him we're not just given what we are given for us to rejoice and and just become just ourselves no we are given in order for us to tear up the world just like the first one butam says they were together it says then they came in they were a persecutor that were scattered out into the world and he says the reason why he scattered them out so they can go and testify I just want us to know to come back to the very Mission and the purpose what is the mission of the church what is the purpose of the church but says the church have long forgotten what they were given there so many he says in fact they've come to a place where they've they've replaced the very mission that they were given with programs with a bunch of programs for this and program for that and the power of God is nowhere to be they were given the power and and and the devil came and take that power right out of the church and and you know you sick they refer you to a doctor you know you you you you mentally heal you know let's find a psychiatrist that's what they all become but there were people that were promised in this same time as our Pastor said the restoration of the real Faith they are not satisfied with just theology or some men's understanding if Jesus Is God if it's the same yesterday today and forever then there has to be a people who says I want to see him I'm not interested in theology I want to see that God for myself I want to meet him I want to touch him I want to feel him I want to see his power manifested isn't one of the things that they couldn't stop about but they would talk all about his theology but when that men stood there oh the power the presence of God all of them denomination name they talk about the presence that was with him what is it it was God making himself known in fact they testify on how they've seen God in this generation once again like they never seen him before amen God bless you [Applause] amen that's the gospel Hallelujah that's the gospel he didn't send the Holy Spirit to save you he send the Holy Spirit to empower you to do the work that he did amen I that's I mean he just expressed what's on my heart and and let me just say this because it's something that has to get washed out of us and it's in US thick is the nickol ladian spirit and the nickan spirits says it's for somebody else to do that's the base root of the spirit that God hates is to conquer the Le and the Le surrendered their calling because they're lazy and Afraid and they let the Ministry speak for them they let the ministry teach them you know brother Billy said something to me that really stirred me today he said so many young people and so many people that have come from different cultures and different things they've sat under Ministries that just tell them everything to do you understand we got a god amen we've got the Holy Spirit God sent his Spirit to lead the church the fivefold ministry is not to Lord over God's Heritage but they're there there to serve maybe through experience or wisdom or things like that but it just just what Billy said it just something that it's a work but and our work is to show the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever to show them the god that you haven't me and if you haven't meant that God then it's our job as a body of Believers not me as a preacher but as a body of Believers to manifest and show that that God is here for you to touch and that's what we want then that's what we want to commune with tonight I mean the we're here that's here and we'll go forward with what we've got here but there's so many people sitting at home and if you're sitting at home and not coming at Communion because you're still afraid of this bug I think you're afraid to die and meet God that might be a little strong but Church used to be where we came to get well now it's we we don't come to church to get well we think if we come to church we'll get sick you you talk about Satan robbing us I love that Billy robbing us from what our purpose is I I could just repr preach that I tried to preach it this morning but now I can repr preach it it it's really a time I I I'm inspired by that each that's what I want to have communion with tonight I want to come have communion with the god that showed himself to me the god that's real and my communion is Lord I want to show you to the world and remember is it's not he didn't say David McGary go and pray for the sick he said you go into all the world you preach the posel these signs shall follow you if you believe in in him like brother Billy said he's there to believe in you and just think of that whenever two agree on any one thing it'll come to pass so you and him is two wherever two or three Gather in my name I'll be in their midst so he's got to be here and is that your heart's desire to come closer to that God young people don't be distracted by this world set set forth in your heart don't be all taken up with every new thing that comes along you know every new boy in town every new girl in town you know what I mean you might look and seek what their motives and objectives are you know and the things that that that take place our motive and objective should be the Lord no I've pastored a long time I've had people show up to church I kind of wonder what it's here and it's not two or three weeks later they got a big sales for me they got a business they want me to get involved in they they they want to have a loan and you sit back what's our motive and objective our motive and objective is him we're here for him that's right and and and I I just think that's marvelous let's go ahead Brothers if you go ahead and get ready for communion and and uh and uh we we certainly uh love the word of God and we'll turn in our scriptures and uh read in our scriptures this evening and and uh uh the great things that we have so let us turn in our Bibles and turn to the um um let me to uh in this this this use the Corinthian scriptures for communion amen so let's stand together this evening turn to the uh 11th chapter you know if you ever we always read the communion part but if you ever go back and read the rest of that 11th chapter it's quite a rebuke to a church that's lost its motive and objective for I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me see the purpose behind it the communion behind it the fellowship behind it and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament my blood this do is offing as you drink it you drink it in remembrance of me amen let us pray Brothers our gracious Heavenly Father Lord before us lies the remembrance of the price that you paid at Calvary the purchase price that you've bought us into your presence the power that you shared with us to Deliver Us From The Bondage of sin and iniquity ities that you are able to bestow upon us your spirit that we could walk in the newness of life and receive the gift of eternal life father we're so gr grateful for that and Lord we ask you to bless this bread father we ask you to feed our spirits and our souls with the communion that we have with you tonight May each of us take a moment to draw closer to you to lay before you and ask you Lord what would you have me to do Lord I want to have a work I want to have a purpose put an unction on my heart put a burden on My Heart Lord I'm here at your service I'm here to commune with you Lord and I love you so much and I want you to be a part of my life and I want to serve you Lord I'm I'm here here father I lay myself down at your altar to have communion with you and father the blood the purchased life father that you laid your life down for us father that the stimulation of the life of that blood returning back unto the believer father the revelation of all that you have done for us father we ask that we could grow in the Revelation and truth of your person father we ask these things tonight as we have communion father that we truly can let the light of this gospel Shine from our hearts and our lives we ask these things in Jesus precious name we pray
