[14:53] Amen. As they just continue to play
[14:55] that, we'll open our service in prayer
[14:58] and also just uh take up the tithes and
[15:01] offerings. And we do have a few uh
[15:03] prayer requests. Um, we have this
[15:07] request for uh, brother Darien's niece,
[15:10] Caitlyn. She's suffering from severe
[15:12] panic attack and we just want to pray
[15:15] that God would deliver her. The you
[15:17] believe that if we bind in prayer that
[15:19] God could go and move on the scene and
[15:22] just deliver her from this oppressive
[15:24] spirit. Amen. you know, um you might
[15:28] it's hard to maybe know what somebody's
[15:31] going through if you've never
[15:32] experienced it, but a panic attack can
[15:35] be a very severe
[15:37] um mental trauma and uh can really has
[15:42] great effects on an individual. So, we
[15:44] we just really want to remember Caitlyn
[15:46] in prayer. And you know, if you don't
[15:48] try to take up the burden and feel the
[15:51] infirmity and think that that's
[15:52] somebody's daughter, that's somebody's
[15:54] niece. And Maya, if that was one of our
[15:56] own or your daughter, you know, we'd
[15:58] really want to go before the Lord. Amen.
[16:00] So, let's just uh remember little
[16:03] Caitlyn in prayer and and also uh
[16:05] Brother Thiago is asking for traveling
[16:08] mercies for his father-in-law and for
[16:09] his wife who who are out. We just ask uh
[16:12] brother David to come and uh just open
[16:15] our service in prayer and those brothers
[16:16] that are prepared to take up the tithes
[16:18] and offerings. Is there somebody here
[16:20] that has an unspoken prayer request but
[16:23] you just want to make it known to the
[16:24] Lord? Amen. God sees that and we're just
[16:27] looking forward to what God has for us
[16:28] this
[16:33] evening. My heart. Let's just enter in
[16:36] together. Heavenly Father, we come
[16:40] before you as humble as we know how. And
[16:43] Lord, we're wanting to encourage our
[16:46] hearts in you as it sometimes just feels
[16:48] we need a touch from you to lift our
[16:50] faith. And Lord, we're going to look
[16:52] back at our giant and our lion. And the
[16:55] different things that you've helped
[16:56] conquer in our lives. And we're going to
[16:58] remember you, Lord, as the God of our
[17:00] salvation. And Father, when we did not
[17:02] know you and our hearts were astray, you
[17:04] sought us. And Father, we can testify
[17:07] that surely your goodness and mercy has
[17:10] pursued us and you've loved us, Father.
[17:12] And where there's condemnation, Lord, or
[17:14] anything, we now just speak your name,
[17:17] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. And
[17:19] Lord, you said you're greater than our
[17:21] hearts. And Lord, this panic attack,
[17:24] this thing that would afflict the mind,
[17:26] Father. Lord, you said nothing could
[17:29] separate us from your love. No height,
[17:31] no depth, no principalities, nor things
[17:34] past, nor things to come, Father. Truly,
[17:37] we're standing on a one victory, Father.
[17:39] It's a completed work, Lord. And you've
[17:42] called us to stand against the darkness,
[17:44] Father. And so, we speak your life. We
[17:46] speak your light that it would shine in
[17:48] darkness, Father, that fear and unbelief
[17:51] would be dissolved. And that Lord, just
[17:53] as you revealed yourself to us when we
[17:55] didn't know you, you would stand present
[17:57] in that need, Father, for your present
[17:59] help in the time of need. That's who you
[18:01] are, Lord. And I don't want to leave the
[18:04] same tonight, Father. I want to be
[18:06] changed. I I want to be more refined in
[18:09] your image. I want the word to
[18:11] accomplish something in my life, Father.
[18:13] where there's any unbelief, there's any
[18:15] makebelief. Father, we want to be
[18:16] genuine, Lord. We want to reflect you in
[18:20] exactly the way we've seen you declare
[18:22] in this day, Father.
[18:25] Lord, first fruits, Father. And Lord, I
[18:28] ask that you would just do the
[18:29] miraculous that, Lord, you'd accomplish
[18:33] in us, which we can't accomplish
[18:34] ourselves. We've tried, Lord, and our
[18:37] efforts have been in vain, Father. But
[18:39] we're coming to you once again and
[18:41] saying, Father, be merciful to us.
[18:43] change us. Lord, each one I believe
[18:45] that's gathered here tonight does not
[18:47] want to leave the same but wants to be
[18:49] leave more in your image. Father, we
[18:51] commit this worship to you. Lord, just
[18:54] ask that you'd have the preeminence,
[18:56] Father, as we've gathered together as
[18:57] saints, Lord, and believers. We bind our
[19:01] faith together and commit it all to you
[19:02] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[19:04] Amen.
[19:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. You may have your
[19:08] seats, man. I had that song in my heart.
[19:11] Uh, when we all get to heaven, what a
[19:14] day of rejoicing that will be. I don't
[19:17] know about you, but I can't
[19:18] wait when we all get to heaven. Amen.
[19:21] Why don't we just sing that with joy in
[19:23] our heart? Well, sing the wondrous love
[19:28] of Jesus. Sing his
[19:32] mercy and his grace.
[19:36] in the
[19:39] direction and lasting will prepare for
[19:44] us.

[25:31] [Music]
[25:38] Ghost
[25:42] will never
[25:45] do.
[25:46] Amen. Amen. And I want to sing that one
[25:48] verse again. And I just want to give,
[25:51] you know, brother Brandham said that you
[25:54] you you you accept it, you believe it,
[25:58] and then you confess it. And we just I
[26:01] want to sing that again. As Sister Haley
[26:02] would come with her song special, but
[26:04] you know, I want to give you an
[26:05] opportunity to say maybe you're sick,
[26:07] maybe ain't feeling too good, but why
[26:08] don't you go ahead and sing the song,
[26:09] you healed my body when I was sick. Why
[26:12] don't you just go ahead and confess it?
[26:15] And God said, "Your confession will
[26:18] bring your body into subjection to your
[26:21] confession." The prophet of God said,
[26:23] "He's He's not the high priest of your
[26:25] feeling. He's the high priest of your
[26:27] confession." So, as our sister come, why
[26:29] don't you just sing this now? Well, you
[26:31] healed my body when I was sick. You've
[26:34] surely been good to me. But now, you
[26:37] healed my body when I was sick. You
[26:40] surely been good to me. Hallelujah. You
[26:44] my body
[26:45] tonight. You surely didn't come to me.
[26:48] Well, you are God. What this world could
[26:52] ever do. Why don't you just praise the
[26:54] Lord?
[26:55] Hallelujah. Amen.
[27:04] God bless you. So, I just wanted to give
[27:06] a little testimony before singing this
[27:08] song. Last Sunday we were on our way to
[27:12] church from Dave and Julia's and we were
[27:17] practicing this song. We were going to
[27:18] sing this song and we ended up getting
[27:21] pulled over by the police because we
[27:25] didn't stop enough at a stop sign. I
[27:26] didn't stop enough at a stop sign
[27:29] and we us three were all in the car and
[27:33] we just went to praying
[27:35] because we just didn't know what to do.
[27:38] and Dave and Julia drove by and they
[27:41] texted us that they were praying too.
[27:44] And we were just praying that they would
[27:46] just see it, find it in their hearts to
[27:49] give us a warning. And they ended up
[27:53] coming back and just giving us a
[27:55] warning. So God answers prayer and we're
[27:59] just really thankful for that.
[28:03] [Applause]
[28:20] You called the sun to
[28:26] rise and you lay it down to rest.
[28:35] You hold this heart of
[28:41] mine and you hold my every breath.
[28:47] Such an awesome

[30:31] and mercy. Oh nothing comes close to the
[30:37] Lord. Oh

[30:52] Jesus, the son of
[30:59] God, hung on a cross to
[31:06] die. But not even death
[31:11] itself could hold you

[39:33] prevail against Israel. And because of
[39:36] the Medidianite, the children of Israel
[39:38] made them the uh ds which are in the
[39:42] mountains and caves and stronghold. And
[39:45] so it was when Israel had sown that the
[39:49] Medidionite came up and the Amalachite
[39:52] and the children of the east even they
[39:55] came up against them and they encamped
[39:58] against them and destroyed uh the
[40:01] increase of the earth till thou come
[40:05] unto Gaza and left uh uh susten u
[40:11] sustenance of Israel neither sheep nor
[40:14] ox
[40:14] nor ass. For they came up uh with the
[40:18] cattle, their tent, and they came uh
[40:21] they came as grasshoppers for multitude,
[40:26] for both they and their camels were
[40:28] without numbers. And they entered into
[40:32] the land and destroyed it. And Israel
[40:34] was greatly impoverished because of the
[40:38] Medidianite. And the children of Israel
[40:40] cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass
[40:42] that when the children of Israel cried
[40:44] unto the Lord, because of the
[40:46] Medidianite, that the Lord sent a
[40:49] prophet unto the children of Israel,
[40:51] which said unto them, Thou saith the
[40:54] Lord of Israel. I I brought I brought
[40:58] you up from Egypt and brought you forth
[41:01] out of the house of bondage and I
[41:04] delivered you out of the hands of
[41:07] Egyptians and out of the hands of all
[41:09] the oppressed uh that oppressed you and
[41:12] and drove them out from before you and
[41:15] gave you the land. And I say unto you, I
[41:19] am the Lord your God. Fear not the gods
[41:23] of the Amorites in which land ye dwell,
[41:27] but ye have not obeyed my voice. Up to
[41:31] what? 14. Uh 14. Yeah. And there came an
[41:34] angel of the Lord, and said unto an oak
[41:36] tree, which was uh an offer, and uh that
[41:41] pertained unto Josiah the Abazites,
[41:46] Abarites, and the son of Gideon, uh uh
[41:50] treed wheat, and the wine press to heed
[41:54] it from the Medidianite. And the angel
[41:56] of the Lord appeared unto him, and said
[41:58] unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou
[42:01] mighty man of valor.
[42:03] Amen. And Gideon said unto him, "Oh my
[42:06] Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then
[42:10] is all the uh where all of this befall
[42:13] us? And where are all his miracles which
[42:17] our father told us? And saying, did not
[42:20] the Lord bring up bring us up from
[42:23] Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us
[42:27] and delivers us unto the hand of the
[42:30] Medidianites." Amen. And Gideon looked
[42:33] upon him and said, "Go in this thy might
[42:39] that thou shall save Israel from the
[42:42] hand of the Medidianite, and have not I
[42:44] send thee?"
[42:46] Amen. Uh Amen.
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] Uh let's also turn to the book of
[42:56] Exodus. Exodus chapter 3.
[43:02] S Adus uh verse three uh I'm sorry
[43:06] chapter 3 verse 7 7 to to 12 it says ye
[43:12] shall no more give the people straw to
[43:15] make bricks as year year to four let
[43:20] them go and gather straw for themselves.
[43:22] Is that the correct chapter? Yeah.
[43:25] Three. Yeah. Yeah. And seven themselves.
[43:30] And the tail of the bricks which they
[43:32] did make here to for ye shall lay upon
[43:36] them. Ye shall ye shall not
[43:39] diminish art.
[43:43] Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm reading five.
[43:46] That's why I'm a bit confused.
[43:49] 37. And the Lord, that's it. said, "I
[43:53] have surely seen the affliction of my
[43:55] people which are in Egypt, and have
[43:58] heard their cry by the reason of their
[44:01] taskmaster. I for I know their sorrows.
[44:05] I am come down to deliver them out of
[44:08] the hands of the Egyptian, and to bring
[44:11] them out of the
[44:14] land, into a good land, and a large,
[44:18] unto a land flowing with milk and honey,
[44:20] unto a place of a Canaanites, of the
[44:23] hatites, and the Hammorites, the
[44:25] parasites, and the Heatites, and the
[44:28] Jebisites. Now therefore, behold, the
[44:31] cry of the children of Israel is come
[44:34] unto me, and I have also seen the
[44:36] oppression wherewith the Egyptian
[44:39] oppressed
[44:40] them. Come now, therefore, I will send
[44:43] thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[44:47] bring forth my people, the children of
[44:50] of Israel, out of Egypt. And Moses said
[44:54] unto the Lord, Who am I that I should go
[44:57] unto Pharaoh, that thou that I should
[45:00] bring forth the children of Israel out
[45:02] of Egypt? And he said, certainly I will
[45:06] be with thee, and this shall be a token
[45:09] unto thee that I have sent thee. When
[45:12] thou had brought forth the people out of
[45:15] Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this
[45:18] mountain. Amen. And just the last one
[45:21] and and then one more.
[45:25] Uh John chapter 14.
[45:30] John chapter 14 12.
[45:34] John chapter 14. We're going to start
[45:36] from verse 12.
[45:39] 12 to 20. He says, "Verily, verily, I
[45:42] say unto you, he that believeth on me,
[45:45] the works that I do, ye shall do also,
[45:48] and greater works, greater works than
[45:50] these ye shall do, because I go unto my
[45:53] father. And whatsoever ye ask in my
[45:58] name, that will I do, that the father
[46:02] may be glorified in the son. If ye ask
[46:06] any, if you ask anything in my name, I
[46:09] will do it. If ye love me, keep my
[46:12] commandments,
[46:14] and I will pray the Father, and he shall
[46:17] give you another comforter, that he may
[46:21] do abide with you forever, even the
[46:24] Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
[46:26] receive, because he had not seen him,
[46:29] neither knoweth him. But ye know him,
[46:32] for he dwelleth with you, and shall be
[46:36] in you. Amen.
[46:38] Just I will not leave you comfortless. I
[46:42] will come to you. Ye yet a little while
[46:46] and the world seeth me no more, but ye
[46:49] see me because I live, ye shall live
[46:53] also. Amen. At that day ye shall know
[46:56] that I am in that I am in the fa in my
[46:59] father and ye in me. and I in you. Amen.
[47:03] Amen.
[47:05] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[47:07] word. You may have your seats tonight.
[47:11] [Music]
[47:12] I want to greet you all in the name of
[47:14] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:19] [Music]
[47:23] I am your brother, brother John.
[47:28] [Music]
[47:30] I reside in London in United Kingdom
[47:36] where the Lord has given me
[47:37] responsibility over little
[47:41] sheep fellowship. My church is called
[47:44] Bible Fellowship Tabernacle.
[47:49] So when you're going to be in London
[47:50] next
[47:51] [Music]
[47:53] time, remember you have brothers over
[47:56] there to visit.
[47:59] And I'm so happy to be in among you
[48:02] [Music]
[48:03] tonight. And I thank the pastor for this
[48:08] opportunity. We spoke to two times
[48:12] and I was telling brother Billy.
[48:16] I was really impressed with him,
[48:19] by his humility,
[48:22] by his simplicity
[48:25] and by his love.
[48:28] He gave me an opportunity to speak to
[48:31] you.
[48:33] I'm not big.
[48:36] I am just one of you
[48:40] and we are here to help one
[48:42] another. There's nothing new in the word
[48:45] of
[48:46] God. There's nothing that I can say that
[48:49] has never been said before.
[48:51] We are all believers of the message.
[48:55] And it's this message that we listen to
[48:57] every
[49:02] day. I think that's a word.
[49:06] We're just repeating. Yeah. We're just
[49:09] repeating. We're just those that eat and
[49:12] repeat.
[49:16] uh you you eat you you you you keep it a
[49:19] little bit and then you eat it again.
[49:23] But there's one thing with the word of
[49:26] God is we don't we don't we don't uh uh
[49:30] we get accustom with God.
[49:35] God is
[49:36] mysterious. He can appear to you today
[49:40] uh inspires fear
[49:44] and when he comes again
[49:45] tomorrow it's going to inspire the fear
[49:50] of you can't meet God and then say oh
[49:53] because I met him now I'm comfortable
[49:55] with
[49:56] him. That's why you can read a a quote
[50:00] or a Bible
[50:01] verse, you read it more than a thousand
[50:04] times, but every time you read
[50:07] it, if you are in the
[50:12] spirit, you you will feel like there's
[50:14] something new that God is trying to show
[50:19] you. So even if I say something you've
[50:21] heard
[50:23] before, God wants you to for you to hear
[50:26] it again.
[50:28] So I'll say amen to that. Amen. Amen.
[50:33] My little subject of exhortation tonight
[50:38] is partnership with
[50:43] God. We live in a difficult time.
[50:48] I took this story of Gideon
[50:52] uh because according to my own
[50:55] perception we are living a a a a sane
[50:59] kind of similar
[51:01] time it's a time a difficult
[51:05] time the time where everybody's
[51:08] complaining when I left
[51:10] Africa I went to
[51:13] [Music]
[51:14] Europe I was thinking that over there
[51:17] everything is
[51:21] fine. I've but I've been in United
[51:24] Kingdom for about 24
[51:26] years. I see government changes. I saw
[51:30] government
[51:31] changes and every new government that
[51:33] they come they come they bring new
[51:36] promises. But when they are in
[51:41] power, as quicker they are in power, the
[51:44] population starts to call out for the
[51:46] other government to come in.
[51:49] So that confirms the word of God.
[51:52] There's no hope in
[51:55] politics. There's no hope in
[52:00] economy. Because everything can go well
[52:02] like we are here in the United States.
[52:06] [Music]
[52:08] But it would only take one president to
[52:10] come in and talk about tariffs and the
[52:11] all economy is
[52:13] tanking. That's why tells
[52:16] us our only hope is the coming back of
[52:20] the Lord Jesus
[52:22] Christ. You cannot count on this
[52:25] world. You cannot count on the
[52:28] economy. You cannot count on the
[52:31] social. Everything is being uh uh uh
[52:34] changed at all
[52:36] times. But the prophet is telling us
[52:45] this. Yeah, that's Yes. But when talks
[52:49] about
[52:54] commun comparing life like a a
[52:58] labyrinthant a labyrinth. Is that the
[53:00] right word? I don't know.
[53:06] Well, it's like a
[53:11] building with with It's like a a mason
[53:15] mason maze.
[53:18] It's a maze.
[53:23] Yeah. He's saying that the only way to
[53:25] get out of that maze
[53:28] is to find the most important thing. And
[53:31] the most important
[53:32] thing is to find Jesus
[53:38] Christ. It was the only way to get out
[53:40] of the
[53:41] maze. Outside of that there's no
[53:45] hope. You can have joy.
[53:48] Today you'll be uh you'll be
[53:51] sad. Today you will be well. Tomorrow
[53:54] you'll be sad. Today you are happy.
[53:57] Tomorrow you are sad.
[54:00] Our only
[54:03] hope, our only source of is the Lord
[54:07] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[54:10] [Music]
[54:13] And and now and here we are talking
[54:15] about Israel.
[54:20] Israel is a nation that God treat he
[54:24] walked with them as a
[54:26] nation. And the prophet told us that the
[54:29] success of
[54:30] [Music]
[54:33] Israel is because the king was the lord
[54:36] of
[54:39] heaven that as when the other countries
[54:42] all the other nations they had kings but
[54:47] Israel a king was the lord of heaven.
[54:51] And how was he leading
[54:53] them? He was a spirit.
[54:57] He was leading them by a prophet.
[55:01] Is that the
[55:03] truth? But one day they wanted to be
[55:05] like all other nations.
[55:08] They said, "Oh, we want a king."
[55:11] And when they they they asked for
[55:13] it, they had
[55:18] Samuel. Uh Samuel tried to bring them in
[55:21] remembrance what was happening to them.
[55:25] They said, "You have the King of
[55:27] Kings. You have the Lord of
[55:30] Lords. Why do you need another
[55:33] king? He's going to make you
[55:37] slaves. He's going to torture
[55:39] you." He showed all of those
[55:42] things, but they said, "We know all of
[55:45] those things, but at least we want a
[55:48] king."
[55:50] They didn't say they rejected God, but
[55:53] in rejecting the prophets, they rejected
[55:56] God.
[55:59] Are you with me?
[56:02] So when you reject a prophet, you're
[56:04] rejecting God.
[56:07] Because God doesn't act outside of the
[56:11] prophet. That's why we are special
[56:14] people. We are we've gotten so much used
[56:18] to the message.
[56:20] And sometimes we think we are like
[56:23] others. But let me tell you
[56:26] this. The prophet makes the difference.
[56:30] [Music]
[56:33] The reason that we are different is
[56:34] because we have received a prophet.
[56:36] Amen. Amen.
[56:40] The Bible says it was by a
[56:43] prophet that the Lord took Israel out of
[56:46] Egypt and by a
[56:49] prophet. Israel was
[56:54] kept. Even the very security of this
[56:57] people was dependent upon the
[56:59] prophet. Is that the
[57:04] truth? Asha was with his
[57:07] [Music]
[57:09] servant when they were followed by the
[57:12] Assyrian
[57:13] army. His servant was
[57:16] scared as we are scared many times in
[57:21] situations. Elisha
[57:24] said, "Lord, open the the young man's
[57:28] eyes
[57:29] so he can see what we
[57:32] have. that he may see the invisible army
[57:35] that's around
[57:37] us. And God opened his eyes and he
[57:42] saw that those that are with us, they
[57:45] are
[57:47] many. But on the other side, he was he
[57:51] didn't
[57:51] understand. Every time they had a
[57:54] plan, the plan was uh alh messed up.
[58:00] There were
[58:01] many. But every time they'll come to
[58:03] attack Israel, the plan was going to be
[58:08] revealed. And the king will ask himself
[58:10] a question. What's going on?
[58:13] Why are all our planes being
[58:16] revealed? Somebody said,
[58:18] "Listen, they have a
[58:21] secret. What is the secret? They have a
[58:24] prophet. examples and when they have a
[58:28] prophet everything every time we planet
[58:32] God reveals that to a
[58:36] prophet that's how the prophet is the
[58:38] security of the people
[58:41] amen our salvation our deliverance
[58:46] will depend upon the prophet that's what
[58:49] makes the
[58:50] difference that's what makes us
[58:52] different from Babylon amen Amen. Amen.
[58:55] Amen.
[59:00] Today people want to bring the prophet
[59:01] back to the
[59:04] Bible. And I know there's many the
[59:07] preachers knows that. There's a lot of
[59:08] people. Oh, we need to bring the prophet
[59:10] back to the Bible. We need to bring the
[59:12] prophet back to the Bible.
[59:14] They said, "Do you understand what
[59:16] you're talking
[59:19] about between the word of
[59:22] God and what's written in the Bible?"
[59:25] Let me shock you for a little
[59:28] bit. The word existed before the
[59:31] writings.
[59:33] Is that true?
[59:36] When Genesis chapter one
[59:39] when God was
[59:41] creating was there any scripture written
[59:44] man uh
[59:45] paper mo Moses was not
[59:48] there was nothing
[59:51] written but John tells us before in the
[59:55] beginning was the
[59:57] word and the word created
[1:00:00] everything so it wasn't the writings
[1:00:03] that created everything But it was the
[1:00:05] word that came from God that created
[1:00:09] everything. And when Moses wrote
[1:00:12] it, it was the testimony of the word of
[1:00:16] God. So the the writings are the
[1:00:19] testimony of the word of
[1:00:21] God. But the word of God is the living
[1:00:25] word is the fresh revelation that God is
[1:00:28] giving to whom he so will. He is
[1:00:33] sovereign. There was I Abel and
[1:00:37] Cain. The both of them were
[1:00:40] worshippers. They had good
[1:00:42] intentions. They didn't have any
[1:00:46] writings. May maybe somebody should tell
[1:00:48] me that they read
[1:00:51] somewhere there was no
[1:00:54] writings. not
[1:00:56] able. It was by the
[1:00:59] revelation that he
[1:01:01] understood that it was about
[1:01:04] life that they had to offer a sacrifice
[1:01:07] an
[1:01:10] animal. So if you wanted to bring Abel
[1:01:14] to the writings, you were going to be at
[1:01:16] in the air. Do you understand what I'm
[1:01:19] saying? Abraham, our father Abraham,
[1:01:23] he saw Elohim.
[1:01:25] He saw three
[1:01:27] people. How did he know that one was
[1:01:30] ever
[1:01:31] there? Did he read it somewhere?
[1:01:35] And that one you will see
[1:01:37] through the one that you will see in the
[1:01:40] great t that's
[1:01:42] Elohim. It was by revelation.
[1:01:48] So the prophet you don't bring him to
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:51] writings because it's a prophet that
[1:01:53] interprets the
[1:01:55] writings. It comes with a
[1:01:59] revelation and what comes from the
[1:02:01] prophet that's what gives you
[1:02:04] life. That's why the latter will kill
[1:02:06] it. But it's the spirit that giveth
[1:02:09] life. So let's leave those things about
[1:02:12] trying to bring the prophet back to the
[1:02:14] writing.
[1:02:16] We are living by the words that were
[1:02:18] pronounced by the
[1:02:22] prophets. And I've I've listened to it
[1:02:25] for 36 years and I never get tired of
[1:02:27] listening to
[1:02:29] it. Nothing will separate me from this
[1:02:32] message. For me, it's life. For me, it's
[1:02:36] salvation. For me, it's everything that
[1:02:39] I have need
[1:02:40] of. I I didn't go through theological
[1:02:45] standing here because I believe the
[1:02:47] prophet. I don't have any uh uh
[1:02:50] preaching.
[1:02:52] I only repeat what the prophet says
[1:02:55] because that's what gives me life. Are
[1:02:57] you with me? Oh, glory to God.
[1:03:01] The
[1:03:03] revelation, you cannot understand it.
[1:03:06] You cannot explain
[1:03:09] it. There was a a a sister who had a
[1:03:12] blood issue.
[1:03:16] Nobody told her that he had to touch the
[1:03:18] garment of
[1:03:20] Jesus. So when you go over there, just
[1:03:23] touch his his
[1:03:25] garment. She never read it anywhere.
[1:03:28] But she receive a
[1:03:31] revelation. Revelation is personal.
[1:03:36] Are you with
[1:03:38] me? A revelation is not shared between
[1:03:41] people.
[1:03:44] When God wants to speak to
[1:03:45] you, he speaks to you
[1:03:48] individually. That's why the prophet
[1:03:51] said that our exodus is so exceptional
[1:03:56] because it's an individual Exodus when
[1:03:59] God is calling
[1:04:01] individuals that will be members of the
[1:04:03] body of
[1:04:06] Christ. We don't believe in a global
[1:04:09] revelation
[1:04:11] because every every revival produces a
[1:04:14] group of
[1:04:15] [Music]
[1:04:17] people but not everybody is there for
[1:04:19] the
[1:04:20] same. There's only the
[1:04:23] minorities and it's always in the
[1:04:26] minority that will they will hold on and
[1:04:29] understand the Exodus. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:04:38] Listen, I called my subject
[1:04:40] tonight. Partnership with God.
[1:04:45] Uh, a a partnership includes two
[1:04:49] people. We are partners like a man and a
[1:04:54] wife in business. We could be part
[1:05:01] partners and that would mean that
[1:05:03] there's a contract negotiated between
[1:05:05] two parties. You
[1:05:09] sit. We want to do something. We want to
[1:05:12] get somewhere. Excuse
[1:05:15] me. I I shouldn't have brought this
[1:05:17] phone here.
[1:05:19] Forgive me.
[1:05:21] I'll switch it off. Okay, I'll sit
[1:05:23] there.
[1:05:32] Okay. Put it in the devil's
[1:05:36] camp. I was saying a
[1:05:40] partnership includes two
[1:05:42] people. You want to do something
[1:05:46] together and you agree upon the terms
[1:05:50] and in a contract.
[1:05:52] There's uh uh rights, privileges,
[1:05:55] there's privileges,
[1:05:57] obligations, and there's obligations
[1:06:02] and there's also concessions to do.
[1:06:06] Do you understand
[1:06:08] me? So, two people they have to agree,
[1:06:12] oh, I'll give this, you will give
[1:06:15] this and we'll sign a paper. We'll work
[1:06:18] together.
[1:06:21] And I'm not talking about the business
[1:06:23] of this world. I'm speaking about God's
[1:06:25] affair business. And the prophet
[1:06:30] says that man is in partnership with
[1:06:33] God.
[1:06:36] Is that true?
[1:06:40] A man is God's
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:45] agent. that God cannot do anything for
[1:06:48] man without coming to man.
[1:06:52] Is that true?
[1:06:56] That's why we believe the prophet
[1:06:59] is a man.
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:03] But God cannot do anything without using
[1:07:05] an agent, a man for your salvation, for
[1:07:09] your
[1:07:10] deliverance, for your
[1:07:13] healing. God will use a man.
[1:07:19] And the prophet said, "The most
[1:07:20] difficult thing for man for God
[1:07:25] is to bring one moral to believe another
[1:07:27] moral
[1:07:30] because man will see
[1:07:32] man. Oh, I see all his
[1:07:35] failings. He's just like me. What's the
[1:07:38] difference?"
[1:07:39] [Music]
[1:07:40] But God need a man.
[1:07:43] He cannot do it by trees.
[1:07:46] He didn't send stars.
[1:07:49] He will always send a man.
[1:07:56] Man has a trouble understanding that.
[1:08:00] And the second thing I want to
[1:08:05] add God has
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:08] difficulties to bring a
[1:08:11] man to believe in himself.
[1:08:17] It's a problem.
[1:08:20] Man doesn't believe in man in
[1:08:23] himself. Man will believe in somebody
[1:08:26] else but in himself he won't believe in
[1:08:28] himself.
[1:08:30] Do you believe? Do you understand
[1:08:35] that? Then you'll see men will run here
[1:08:38] and there trying to find
[1:08:40] healing because they hear oh there's an
[1:08:43] evangelist over there. They'll run over
[1:08:45] there. Oh, he he heals. That one heals.
[1:08:49] Oh, he does
[1:08:51] miracles. There's no man that
[1:08:54] heals. There's no man that saves.
[1:08:57] There's no man who delivers.
[1:08:59] God is the only deliverer. God is the
[1:09:02] only one that can deliver. God is the
[1:09:05] only one that can save.
[1:09:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:12] Salvation is not up to man.
[1:09:15] It's God himself who's going to do it.
[1:09:22] But the problem is you have to believe
[1:09:24] in
[1:09:27] yourself. I'm not going to be long.
[1:09:29] We're going to get there. We see uh
[1:09:32] Gideon
[1:09:34] uh in the time of
[1:09:38] trouble. It was very difficult that
[1:09:40] every time he planted
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:43] and the children of
[1:09:46] Israel, they'll come and they will do
[1:09:48] all the hard work.
[1:09:51] But at the time of the harvest,
[1:09:54] the Medidianites will come and they'll
[1:09:56] take to destroy
[1:09:59] everything. It's like you and I, we
[1:10:05] work me for instance, I'll tell you
[1:10:09] that every time I receive my
[1:10:13] salary, I I'm more stressed than when I
[1:10:15] didn't get my
[1:10:18] salary, I I'm I'm
[1:10:21] I'm the moment I get paid, I get the
[1:10:25] stress
[1:10:26] starts because the medianites are around
[1:10:30] there. Oh, the rent is going to go
[1:10:32] hidden. Oh, tax is going to take that.
[1:10:35] Oh, electricity is going to take that.
[1:10:37] Insurance is going to take that. Oh,
[1:10:40] this is going to take that. I find with
[1:10:42] I I'm left with
[1:10:44] nothing. I work for what?
[1:10:48] Medianites.
[1:10:50] You understand?
[1:10:53] It's the
[1:10:58] truth. It's the truth.
[1:11:02] It it's it's truly
[1:11:05] people are under
[1:11:07] pressure under with tension all the
[1:11:16] time. You're watching TV or news. It's
[1:11:19] you are there's
[1:11:22] nervousness. People that come from Congo
[1:11:24] like
[1:11:28] me. They know that if you if you follow
[1:11:31] the news, you're going to get
[1:11:35] stressed. You know, sadly, it's not just
[1:11:38] Congo.
[1:11:39] Even in now in America,
[1:11:44] I was in a church in
[1:11:46] Columbus. I preached
[1:11:50] there. Uh before I started preaching,
[1:11:52] the pastor came there and he was crying.
[1:11:56] Half of the church left. Why?
[1:12:01] Because they are Haitians
[1:12:07] and they were they were intimidated by
[1:12:09] all of the the the presidential talk
[1:12:11] about immigration
[1:12:13] and they decided to go
[1:12:16] back how much stress that caused
[1:12:22] so it's difficult
[1:12:24] times. I don't know how it works in
[1:12:27] America, but there in in where I come
[1:12:30] from the
[1:12:31] country, even sending kids to school is
[1:12:34] a problem.
[1:12:38] They teach the kids about
[1:12:41] sexuality. You think about
[1:12:44] that. I teach I send my kids to get get
[1:12:47] educated
[1:12:49] and they'll tell my my my son or my
[1:12:52] daughter, you are trapped in the wrong
[1:12:54] gender. You are you are in the wrong
[1:12:56] body.
[1:12:58] You understand that?
[1:13:02] It's very stressful in all sense of
[1:13:04] life. And in all of that,
[1:13:09] the children of
[1:13:11] God, they forget their position.
[1:13:17] They are consumed by
[1:13:21] circumstances. And I call that the
[1:13:23] crisis of identity.
[1:13:28] When you forget who you are, it's a
[1:13:30] crisis of identity.
[1:13:33] That's what happened to Gideon.
[1:13:37] He saw
[1:13:39] sufferings. He didn't know what to
[1:13:43] do. But he found grace before
[1:13:46] God. God wanted to come visit him.
[1:13:51] He was the one chosen to get the people
[1:13:53] out of the
[1:13:55] suffering. But before I can say that,
[1:13:58] I would like to insist on
[1:14:00] this. The Bible says there in
[1:14:04] Judges. And it's because of their
[1:14:10] disobedience that God allowed a
[1:14:13] Medianite to come and impose that
[1:14:15] suffering upon them.
[1:14:21] It's God who allowed the Medidianites to
[1:14:23] come after
[1:14:25] them. So in parenthesis
[1:14:28] in our lives as the children of
[1:14:31] God things
[1:14:34] happen but we have to pay
[1:14:37] attention. There's two sources of of of
[1:14:40] uh uh
[1:14:43] um negative the of negative things.
[1:14:51] You have to examine your life when
[1:14:54] things are happening in your life.
[1:14:57] A child of God will go back in the word
[1:15:01] and he will he will compare himself with
[1:15:03] the scripture
[1:15:06] and he will try to see is there
[1:15:08] something I need to fix with
[1:15:13] God the prophet said in in a message be
[1:15:17] certain if you have things to fix with
[1:15:20] God you fix those
[1:15:24] things and if there are things that you
[1:15:26] need to uh to to do restitution. Go
[1:15:29] ahead and do that. You be sure that you
[1:15:32] between you and God, there's nothing
[1:15:35] there's nothing that's going to stop
[1:15:37] your relation with God. And then after
[1:15:40] that, if the situation doesn't
[1:15:44] change, but says that's the
[1:15:48] faith. Just be still and know that he is
[1:15:51] God.
[1:15:55] Go read the story of Lazarus.
[1:15:58] Lazarus got sick.
[1:16:01] They tell
[1:16:03] Jesus the g the healer.
[1:16:07] Instead of him coming quickly, the
[1:16:10] scripture says that he went even further
[1:16:13] away. It was probably at that time just
[1:16:16] a headache. They tell him and he went
[1:16:18] away.
[1:16:20] The disciples says, "But why this kind
[1:16:23] of conduct, but it's your
[1:16:25] friend. They tell you that he's sick."
[1:16:29] He said, "Be
[1:16:31] still." That the sickness of our brother
[1:16:34] Lazarus is for the glory of God.
[1:16:40] A sickness for the glory of God. Yes.
[1:16:45] So there are things that can happen for
[1:16:46] the glory of God.
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] And he didn't want to intervene at that
[1:16:54] time because he wanted the situation to
[1:16:57] get worse.
[1:16:59] Because the more darker the night
[1:17:02] [Music]
[1:17:04] get the more the light will be shining.
[1:17:11] When the the trying is greater,
[1:17:15] the glory is also greater.
[1:17:20] So when you pray you say why is this
[1:17:22] situation getting
[1:17:25] worse? God wants to to get a greater
[1:17:28] glory in that situation. So when you are
[1:17:31] in order with his
[1:17:33] word just be still and know that he is
[1:17:36] God.
[1:17:40] There was this man who was born blind.
[1:17:45] The disciple asked
[1:17:46] Jesus, "Why is he born
[1:17:49] blind? Is it because he
[1:17:52] sinned? Is it because his parents sin?"
[1:17:55] Jesus said, "No, he didn't sin." The
[1:17:59] parents didn't sin. But he's born this
[1:18:03] way so that the works of God might be
[1:18:06] manifested.
[1:18:11] [Music]
[1:18:13] God had attributes
[1:18:15] [Music]
[1:18:16] that he was burning to
[1:18:22] [Music]
[1:18:25] manifest. Ask yourself, how is he going
[1:18:28] to manifest those things if everything
[1:18:30] was in order?
[1:18:33] If you want a simple an easier life,
[1:18:38] how are you going to know him in his
[1:18:40] attribute?
[1:18:42] If you never gotten
[1:18:43] sick, you will never know is Jehovah
[1:18:47] Rafa. Is that
[1:18:49] true if you never been in
[1:18:52] sin? You never going to know he's a
[1:18:55] savior. That's why he allows those
[1:18:58] things to come so you will know his
[1:19:01] attributes.
[1:19:03] That's why you don't have to
[1:19:06] [Music]
[1:19:07] complain. The prophet said that the
[1:19:10] problem that God had with the children
[1:19:11] of Israel
[1:19:13] was that they were constantly
[1:19:15] complaining and complaining and
[1:19:17] complaining. God delivered them. They
[1:19:20] testified of that. They danced on that.
[1:19:23] They sang on those
[1:19:24] things. But it's just a little temp
[1:19:27] trial
[1:19:29] come quickly. They started saying asking
[1:19:32] forgiveness from Pharaoh. Oh, Pharaoh
[1:19:35] was a mistake. Moses lied to us. We want
[1:19:38] to go back to Egypt.
[1:19:41] Over there, we had
[1:19:43] tomatoes. They forgot that they were
[1:19:47] crying. That's the problem with people
[1:19:50] that are complaining.
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:19:54] a a a man who's or a woman who
[1:19:56] complains,
[1:19:59] he is crowned by Satan.
[1:20:03] Did you ever read that?
[1:20:07] If a man or woman constantly complains
[1:20:09] is crowned by
[1:20:11] Satan because a child of
[1:20:14] God, he will he will hold on and he will
[1:20:17] be able to take the trial because he
[1:20:20] knows that all things work together for
[1:20:22] good. those that don't love God.
[1:20:26] I say to my
[1:20:27] church in our language,
[1:20:32] there's no failing.
[1:20:36] We we're never going to fail. Either we
[1:20:39] win
[1:20:43] or or we win
[1:20:47] or we're going to learn.
[1:20:50] You
[1:20:51] understand? A child of God will never
[1:20:54] fail. When you try something, if it
[1:20:57] didn't
[1:20:59] work, God gives you an opportunity to
[1:21:01] learn.
[1:21:03] But the next time you're going to
[1:21:05] overcome,
[1:21:07] there's no failing with God. Amen.
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:13] It's the mental state.
[1:21:18] Amnesia
[1:21:20] causes us to forget who we are
[1:21:24] and for causes us to forgive to forget
[1:21:27] who God is.
[1:21:29] And so was the case with Gideon.
[1:21:35] God
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:40] comes mighty man of
[1:21:43] father.
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:46] Imagine it was a young man who's never
[1:21:49] been to a fight.
[1:21:51] He's never been to any fight. But God
[1:21:54] looks at him. Mighty man of father.
[1:21:58] The first thing that Gideon does is to
[1:22:01] look
[1:22:03] himself. He said, "Is this man serious?"
[1:22:08] He's talking about me.
[1:22:12] It's not a story. is talking about you,
[1:22:14] you, you and you. I'm not I'm talking
[1:22:17] about
[1:22:18] us. The Bible
[1:22:20] says those things are written
[1:22:24] to serve as of
[1:22:27] example written. He wrote his word in
[1:22:30] men and
[1:22:32] women. And the prophet said the thing
[1:22:34] that God did, he will do the same
[1:22:37] today. If you come on the basis of the
[1:22:40] same word. Is that the truth?
[1:22:44] So when when you speak about Gideon, I'm
[1:22:46] talking about you. I don't know your
[1:22:49] problem. I don't know what your
[1:22:51] difficulty is, but God is calling you
[1:22:53] mighty man of valor.
[1:22:56] And you should say amen to that. You are
[1:22:59] a mighty man of
[1:23:00] valor. You don't know yourself.
[1:23:06] Now Gideon says,
[1:23:11] "Why are you calling me mighty man?
[1:23:15] Look at the suffering that we have going
[1:23:18] on. Look at what our enemies are doing
[1:23:20] to
[1:23:22] us. They talk to
[1:23:26] us of what God did for our fathers,
[1:23:30] the miracles and all the the things
[1:23:36] So now Gideon is giving God a a history
[1:23:42] lesson. And that's that's why we that's
[1:23:45] where we excel.
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] God did over there.
[1:23:52] Sister George,
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:56] sister, the the the boy in
[1:23:59] Finland, but you are in the
[1:24:02] circumstance. The God of Harry White is
[1:24:04] your God.
[1:24:06] He has never changed.
[1:24:10] Are you listening to me?
[1:24:13] It's good to testify of the history.
[1:24:16] Butam is
[1:24:18] saying to for what good is a historical
[1:24:22] God if it's not good for
[1:24:25] me if it cannot anything for me. Why am
[1:24:29] I going to
[1:24:32] testify? God is giving you an
[1:24:34] opportunity to talk about yourself,
[1:24:37] to talk about your story.
[1:24:41] We say in
[1:24:42] English, there's no testimony without a
[1:24:46] test.
[1:24:51] There's no testimony without a test.
[1:24:58] Brother says, imagine living a life
[1:25:00] without tension.
[1:25:04] We were we're going to be like a dog.
[1:25:07] Everything is good. All is well. No. No.
[1:25:09] No. No. No. No. No.
[1:25:12] Eleazar
[1:25:14] was
[1:25:15] sent to find a bride for
[1:25:18] Isaac and that's the mission for
[1:25:21] brother
[1:25:24] says brother says Elisa went to find
[1:25:27] character
[1:25:29] and
[1:25:30] character is not a gift
[1:25:34] character is a
[1:25:36] victory you have to fight so you can
[1:25:40] have victory
[1:25:41] Then God will give you character.
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:48] Even Jesus Christ was formed by by the
[1:25:51] trying. Who are you to say that God will
[1:25:55] not send me a test
[1:25:58] mighty man of valor?
[1:26:02] He says,
[1:26:07] God tells him, "But it's you who's going
[1:26:09] to deliver this."
[1:26:11] He looks himself again and
[1:26:14] said, "I'm going to do how am I going to
[1:26:16] do it?" God said,
[1:26:20] [Music]
[1:26:23] Go with the strength that you have.
[1:26:27] Is that what the Bible says?
[1:26:31] FBI. He didn't say go form an FBI over
[1:26:34] here
[1:26:35] or go form an army over
[1:26:39] there. God starts with what you
[1:26:43] have. Hallelujah.
[1:26:46] It's already in you.
[1:26:49] But when says in a message faith,
[1:26:54] all that man has need of for this
[1:26:57] earthly trial, God has already placed it
[1:27:00] in you.
[1:27:03] It's not going to come from
[1:27:05] outside. Are you saying amen to
[1:27:07] that? Your healing is already in you.
[1:27:11] Your salvation is already in you.
[1:27:14] Deliverance is already in you.
[1:27:17] Brother says you have to activate that
[1:27:19] by faith.
[1:27:22] Is that the truth?
[1:27:27] Everything is in you.
[1:27:31] But you are you don't know who you are.
[1:27:34] Mighty man of valor.
[1:27:38] Another similar story.
[1:27:42] Another contract.
[1:27:45] Because all of this when God meets a man
[1:27:47] in order to give them a mission,
[1:27:50] it's a negotiation of contract.
[1:27:54] God does concessions.
[1:28:00] God will ask you for
[1:28:02] something. There was
[1:28:07] Moses. Nobody knew
[1:28:10] Moses. His name was not written in the
[1:28:13] Bible. But he's the one who wrote the
[1:28:15] Bible.
[1:28:16] Anyway, when I speak to
[1:28:20] people, the unbeliever will say,
[1:28:22] "Where's the name of William Brham in
[1:28:24] the Bible?"
[1:28:27] It's just
[1:28:29] ignorance. God doesn't give the name in
[1:28:31] the
[1:28:32] promise. It's when the promise comes to
[1:28:35] pass that we see what God promised to
[1:28:38] come to pass. We say, "This is God."
[1:28:42] That's it.
[1:28:45] Moses came out of
[1:28:47] nowhere. When when God talked to
[1:28:50] Abraham, he was he didn't say, "I will
[1:28:52] send unto you Moses."
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] God will fulfill his
[1:29:02] promise and it's he himself who will
[1:29:04] choose the man by which he will bring
[1:29:06] the promise to come to pass.
[1:29:10] And most of the time he does it to
[1:29:12] confuse human intelligence.
[1:29:19] He calls
[1:29:25] Moses. Moses understood something
[1:29:27] because his Moses mother told him told
[1:29:30] him what he should have he should do.
[1:29:35] But like many of us, we try to go a
[1:29:37] little faster.
[1:29:40] It's true you want to do this. But did
[1:29:43] you pray?
[1:29:45] Are you sure it's the time of God?
[1:29:48] Are you believe that it's the season for
[1:29:51] it? A child of God
[1:29:55] says, you will find the will of God in
[1:29:58] prayer. You will search the scripture.
[1:30:01] Amen.
[1:30:05] We are not just you wake up and you do
[1:30:07] whatever. God has a a a will a will
[1:30:12] for your for your life
[1:30:15] and it's for you to search that
[1:30:19] [Music]
[1:30:21] will. That's how he he hides
[1:30:24] supernatural elements into our
[1:30:28] lives because if you if he shows you
[1:30:31] your whole future, you're not going to
[1:30:34] seek for it.
[1:30:37] Is that it?
[1:30:40] Moses, he went quickly with his
[1:30:43] intellectual understanding
[1:30:46] and he he he made a a great mess of
[1:30:49] it. But God took him
[1:30:52] somewhere to negotiate the
[1:30:55] contract because God needed a partner.
[1:30:59] He promised that I will come down. And
[1:31:03] then it says, I am calmed down.
[1:31:06] But God, you have come down. But why do
[1:31:08] you need a man?
[1:31:11] Because God does nothing without a
[1:31:14] man. Because man is God's
[1:31:18] partner. When it's for our
[1:31:21] deliverance, God doesn't come like a
[1:31:23] spirit.
[1:31:25] He comes as a kinsman redeemer.
[1:31:31] Is that the truth?
[1:31:34] So Moses also situation. He's before the
[1:31:37] situation.
[1:31:39] God wants to change
[1:31:43] him. God said, "I'll send
[1:31:48] you." Moses started to do the same thing
[1:31:50] like Gideon. Look at me. Who am I?
[1:31:58] the army of the United States of
[1:32:01] America because at the time Egypt was
[1:32:04] almost like equal to a United
[1:32:06] States who am what am I going to do God
[1:32:12] says mighty men of power you have
[1:32:15] everything in you doubt okay okay let's
[1:32:21] see will use what you have.
[1:32:27] What do you have?
[1:32:30] Take your hand. The hand of who?
[1:32:35] The hands of who? Of Moses.
[1:32:39] We're going to use what you have. Take
[1:32:42] your hands and put it in your bosom. Oh,
[1:32:45] leprosy. Oh, where did this come from?
[1:32:48] Moses, he came from you.
[1:32:51] Put back your hand again.
[1:32:53] Oh, it's gone. You see, you have all the
[1:32:58] power. You can create
[1:33:00] sickness. You can also bring healing.
[1:33:03] So, everything is in you. Moses says,
[1:33:07] "Really? What was
[1:33:10] it?" God was opening up his
[1:33:15] consciousness to make him realize that
[1:33:17] he was also because
[1:33:21] Omnipotent and man is omnip omnipotent.
[1:33:25] Have you ever read that? Omnipotent. Man
[1:33:28] is omnipotent.
[1:33:31] And God is also
[1:33:33] omnipotent. It says when the two
[1:33:36] omnipotent come
[1:33:37] together. Miracles has to
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:41] happen. Nothing is impossible to them
[1:33:44] that
[1:33:44] believe. And nothing is impossible to
[1:33:47] God.
[1:33:49] The two together will bring forth h
[1:33:54] lightnings. That's the partnership
[1:33:56] that's coming together. God says to
[1:34:00] Moses, "I'm going to deliver this
[1:34:02] people, but I need
[1:34:05] you because the law of
[1:34:09] redemption requires that it be a kinsman
[1:34:12] redeemer. I cannot do it as a spirit. I
[1:34:15] need you so I can send you." Moses
[1:34:18] doubts again and God says, "Wait, what
[1:34:20] do you have?
[1:34:23] I have a stick."
[1:34:26] It was a stick of who?
[1:34:29] Stick.
[1:34:32] The Moses
[1:34:34] stick. It wasn't a stick that came down
[1:34:37] from heaven. It was Moses stick.
[1:34:42] God said, "We will use what you have.
[1:34:46] Take your stick. I want you to throw it
[1:34:49] on the floor. He throw it and he become
[1:34:51] a snake. He says, "Oh, oh, it's
[1:34:54] my Moses. See, you are powerful. You are
[1:34:58] mighty man of
[1:34:59] valor. You don't know what you are able
[1:35:02] to do. My brother, my sister, you don't
[1:35:04] know what the power you have to
[1:35:07] do. The word is here to open our
[1:35:09] consciousness
[1:35:11] so we know that we are like God.
[1:35:16] Is that the truth?
[1:35:20] But says we are creators.
[1:35:23] Is that the truth?
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:27] You can create a world and go live in
[1:35:29] it.
[1:35:32] It's just under control.
[1:35:36] A child of God when he goes somewhere
[1:35:40] there's a situation that's not going
[1:35:43] your presence can change the
[1:35:46] circumstances if God is in you the
[1:35:49] creator
[1:35:51] you too you can
[1:35:53] create
[1:35:58] amen we had we received a man who
[1:36:01] understood that William William Brham
[1:36:05] That's why we talk about him. He
[1:36:08] understood that
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:12] Moses go with what you have.
[1:36:16] You will deliver this people with what
[1:36:18] you have. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:36:22] Don't ask yourself
[1:36:24] questions. Where would the strength come
[1:36:26] from? The strength will come from you.
[1:36:29] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:36:35] But says God never promised a life
[1:36:38] without
[1:36:39] trouble. Is that true?
[1:36:45] He's not going to say that your life
[1:36:46] will be easy. Everything will go
[1:36:49] well. But he promised your
[1:36:54] grace so we can overcome our trials.
[1:37:00] That's why a child of God cannot
[1:37:02] complain. I don't
[1:37:05] complain. Even when things go
[1:37:08] wrong, I know God knows why he's doing
[1:37:12] that. He knows the way. He's the one who
[1:37:16] called
[1:37:17] me. But when says nothing can ruin you.
[1:37:22] Give it back to
[1:37:23] him. Tell him, God, it's you that call
[1:37:26] me. It's you that knows the way. It's
[1:37:29] you that knows tomorrow. It's not a you
[1:37:32] that knows the circumstance. It's you
[1:37:34] that brings the circumstance.
[1:37:38] I know that you are in me.
[1:37:42] That's the secret of the contract of the
[1:37:47] partnership. God gives you the power and
[1:37:50] he reminds you that you are powerful
[1:37:54] and you give him your flesh.
[1:37:58] That's why
[1:38:00] says a man totally surrendered to God.
[1:38:06] You see the
[1:38:07] condition totally surrendered to God
[1:38:12] is
[1:38:16] omnipotent. When you are surely
[1:38:19] surrendered your life becomes a
[1:38:23] thunder. Even the devil cannot
[1:38:25] understand you.
[1:38:28] Because God place upon you all the
[1:38:30] anointing. You become a mystic.
[1:38:34] You are in front of circumstance.
[1:38:40] You you you have the skin of a lamb.
[1:38:44] Humility. But you
[1:38:47] yourself, you come where there's
[1:38:50] sin because God doesn't tolerate sin.
[1:38:54] You have the anointing of the lion. You
[1:38:57] call out no that not this the same
[1:39:01] person
[1:39:04] you are in more afraid like our God
[1:39:07] you come before a circumstance
[1:39:10] that requires
[1:39:12] intelligence God gives you
[1:39:17] intelligence let me tell you about the
[1:39:20] story there was a sister
[1:39:24] who was talking to uh unbelievers
[1:39:27] about the
[1:39:29] Bible. Like the unbelievers, they like
[1:39:32] to debate about the word. Do you believe
[1:39:35] the the Bible really? The sister says,
[1:39:37] "Yeah, I believe the Bible. It's the
[1:39:39] word of God." Do you believe everything?
[1:39:42] The sister said, "Yeah." Even the story
[1:39:44] of Jonah. He said,
[1:39:48] "Yes." You believe that a man can be
[1:39:50] swallowed up by a well three days and
[1:39:52] three nights?
[1:39:54] They say sister say yes I believe. Is
[1:39:56] that how you believe that?
[1:40:00] I really don't know how to explain
[1:40:02] that because the word of God that
[1:40:04] doesn't explain
[1:40:06] the Bible the word of God that it's not
[1:40:08] for explanation is to
[1:40:13] believe. It said one day I'll meet
[1:40:16] brother Jonas in heaven
[1:40:18] and I will ask
[1:40:20] him explain to me exactly how that
[1:40:23] happened.
[1:40:25] The unbeliever look at
[1:40:27] him how do you know Jonas is in
[1:40:30] heaven. The the intelligence of the man
[1:40:33] comes the sister says don't
[1:40:38] worry because you don't believe that
[1:40:40] you'll be in heaven. Then when you'll be
[1:40:43] in hell,
[1:40:44] you're going to ask him that
[1:40:47] question. Debate is over.
[1:40:50] It's the intelligence.
[1:40:52] The same
[1:40:54] person when it's about the problems of
[1:40:57] this world that gives him the anointing
[1:41:00] of an
[1:41:01] eagle because the the anointing of an
[1:41:04] eagle is not terrestrial. The eagle is
[1:41:07] given to fly. God gives you wings to
[1:41:10] fly.
[1:41:13] All of the trials and the
[1:41:15] problems when you feel like there's a
[1:41:18] devil just starts to fly. Why? Because
[1:41:21] you are an eagle and quickly go far.
[1:41:25] You'll go in the supernatural.
[1:41:30] Is that the truth?
[1:41:34] But a brother says that God is like
[1:41:36] mother eagle.
[1:41:38] He likes to take his children all the
[1:41:40] way up.
[1:41:42] All the way up.
[1:41:44] And when they get over there,
[1:41:47] they look at the world down
[1:41:51] below. Oh, you little Satan.
[1:41:54] You cannot do anything to me.
[1:41:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:41:59] I'm going to stop short because the time
[1:42:01] is gone. Listen. says
[1:42:06] a guide about paragraph
[1:42:09] 35. You know why there were
[1:42:13] seals at the end of the seven seals?
[1:42:17] We know who God
[1:42:19] is, his nature, his
[1:42:24] being, how he
[1:42:25] act, what he
[1:42:29] loves. Inside of us, nobody knows God.
[1:42:33] It's us that know God in his
[1:42:37] characteristics because God opened that
[1:42:39] to us. And the prophet
[1:42:42] says after you know God
[1:42:47] that means we have to be high up
[1:42:52] there in the statue of the sons and sons
[1:42:56] and daughters of
[1:42:57] God. And when we are up there, we're
[1:43:01] looking everything
[1:43:02] down. When a little demon comes, we say,
[1:43:06] "Oh, you are
[1:43:08] down eagle. I'm up here.
[1:43:11] Nothing is going to scare you. Nothing
[1:43:13] will bother you. Nothing will scare
[1:43:18] you. You You have the power. You are
[1:43:22] omnipotent. Amen.
[1:43:27] He who is in
[1:43:30] us we say like a slogan
[1:43:33] but before situations we
[1:43:40] forget
[1:43:42] says God had uh three perh three-fold
[1:43:46] purpose
[1:43:49] the first purpose was to reveal himself.
[1:43:54] The second purpose is what I want to
[1:43:56] talk about.
[1:43:58] He wanted to have
[1:44:02] preeminence. He wanted to leave to live
[1:44:04] in man.
[1:44:08] And the prophet
[1:44:10] says that the only prayer of
[1:44:14] Jesus was to be in communion with us.
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] The same way that you are in me and I in
[1:44:23] you,
[1:44:25] I would like to have the same communion
[1:44:28] with them.
[1:44:30] Me in them and them in I. Hallelujah.
[1:44:32] Hallelujah.
[1:44:35] Amen. That's why the Holy
[1:44:38] Spirit, it's a marvelous promise.
[1:44:44] Because it's by that's the means by
[1:44:46] which God can come and dwell in us.
[1:44:50] Before that
[1:44:52] they also had intellectual faith because
[1:44:55] they
[1:44:57] heard they believed
[1:45:01] intellectually. But as long as the Holy
[1:45:03] Spirit was not there,
[1:45:06] there was no true conversion.
[1:45:11] That's why the same
[1:45:13] Peter who one day he took his sword to
[1:45:18] to defend Jesus. St. Peter, he he he he
[1:45:23] uh he denied Jesus
[1:45:27] and Jesus looks at him and says, "Peter,
[1:45:31] it's not the battle after flesh.
[1:45:35] You need the spirit.
[1:45:37] And when you be converted,
[1:45:40] strengthen your
[1:45:42] brothers. It was it was also his own
[1:45:45] experience.
[1:45:48] It was that was Pentecost.
[1:45:50] Pentecost
[1:45:52] was the conversion.
[1:45:55] Peter who was uh uh scared
[1:45:59] the day of Pentecost. It was a man
[1:46:03] changed says,
[1:46:05] not a man, not a woman, not a preacher,
[1:46:11] nobody can call himself a
[1:46:15] Christian if he has not met God in the
[1:46:18] burning bush
[1:46:20] experience because you have to have your
[1:46:23] own
[1:46:25] testimony. The faith is a testimony.
[1:46:29] David had the faith.
[1:46:32] And his faith was based upon his
[1:46:34] experience. That's why he was going from
[1:46:37] victory to
[1:46:38] victory because he knew where he met
[1:46:41] God. Every time there was
[1:46:44] a he knew that a God who delivered them
[1:46:46] over hell is the same God who will
[1:46:49] deliver him over you. He was so sure
[1:46:53] because he had an
[1:46:55] experience. My brother, my sister,
[1:46:58] without the personal experience, you
[1:47:01] will never get anywhere.
[1:47:05] It we It has to revolt us.
[1:47:10] Instead of waiting for somebody to pray
[1:47:12] for you,
[1:47:14] discover who you
[1:47:15] are, even before they pray for
[1:47:18] you, you already have the
[1:47:21] solution. Jesus is in the boat.
[1:47:25] Jesus in the boat with you. He's just
[1:47:28] trying to
[1:47:29] sleep. He wants to see the reaction of
[1:47:32] your face. Just wake him up. Wake up
[1:47:35] Jesus. He's in you. He's not somewhere
[1:47:39] else. He's already here.
[1:47:43] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:47] That's why we have the act of the
[1:47:48] apostles.
[1:47:50] It was the act of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:47:53] apostles.
[1:47:55] They didn't call themselves They didn't
[1:47:57] call him Christians.
[1:48:00] They didn't call themselves Christians.
[1:48:03] People saw them. They say these are
[1:48:07] Christians because they saw the the
[1:48:09] works of Christ in them. Christ was in
[1:48:14] them. That's why they had the courage.
[1:48:17] When Peter was walking, they saw the man
[1:48:20] on the gate called beautiful and said,
[1:48:22] "Oh, look.
[1:48:24] You asking for
[1:48:25] money. We have more than money. We have
[1:48:29] life. We have Christ in us. We have the
[1:48:33] power in us. We are
[1:48:35] omnipotent. Stand up and
[1:48:39] walk. That's what the church had needed.
[1:48:43] Men and
[1:48:44] women who will prove that God is not in
[1:48:47] history.
[1:48:49] But it's the it's the gospel in present
[1:48:52] time. Amen.
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] For what good is it to paint a fire for
[1:49:01] somebody's call?
[1:49:03] He need a real God.
[1:49:05] That he needs your God. You You are
[1:49:08] mighty man of valor.
[1:49:14] Now the power was in the apostles.
[1:49:17] Everything was good.
[1:49:20] When one day they asked Jesus,
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] We want to see Jesus
[1:49:28] because people need Jesus.
[1:49:30] They want to see Jesus. Even today,
[1:49:34] people want to see Jesus.
[1:49:38] When and then he says when a seed falls
[1:49:41] on the ground,
[1:49:44] he said it will not abide alone. It will
[1:49:46] not reproduce itself. The world needs
[1:49:49] Jesus. We need Jesus.
[1:49:51] So the the grain has to fall
[1:49:55] so it could produce a Jesus
[1:49:59] so that the works that I do you can do
[1:50:02] it
[1:50:03] also not in quality
[1:50:07] in
[1:50:08] quantity because Jesus will be here
[1:50:10] Jesus will be over there will be Jesus
[1:50:13] on the other side will be Jesus on the
[1:50:14] other side do you believe do you
[1:50:16] understand what I'm saying not the
[1:50:19] physical form but the same spirit
[1:50:25] because Jesus is the same yesterday,
[1:50:26] today, and tomorrow in every
[1:50:29] detail with outside of his physical
[1:50:32] being. He you will always see
[1:50:35] him. He changes
[1:50:38] tabernacles. Oh, we're not going to go
[1:50:40] there.
[1:50:44] But when I said that the Holy Spirit was
[1:50:46] tied by denomination,
[1:50:50] but God promised at the end that we will
[1:50:52] restore. We are in the time of
[1:50:55] restoration. That's why we receive
[1:50:57] Malachi
[1:50:59] 4 back to the original faith. Is that
[1:51:03] the truth? That's where we are. And
[1:51:06] says,
[1:51:08] I'm just going to read this situ this uh
[1:51:11] quote also. Today, you and
[1:51:16] I, we have
[1:51:19] possibilities that no other man has
[1:51:21] never had in any other age. Can we read
[1:51:24] that

[2:00:00] had something to me just I just wanted
[2:00:01] to fly and I started thinking of that
[2:00:04] song. You know, some glad morning. Yes,
[2:00:06] sir.
[2:00:08] Oh, we're going to take a step. We have
[2:00:10] opportunities that Enoch never had and
[2:00:12] Paul never had. I mean, the seven seals
[2:00:15] have been revealed. You know, you know,
[2:00:16] it's it it could be tonight. It could be
[2:00:18] tomorrow, but one of these days, we're
[2:00:20] just going to step right on out of here.
[2:00:22] And I got to thinking about I want to
[2:00:23] just fly right now. I know. I know some
[2:00:25] glad morning we'll fly. But, you know,
[2:00:27] we can fly right now. And while you're
[2:00:29] flying above all your trials and above
[2:00:31] everything else, when that little imp
[2:00:33] that devil comes around like he was
[2:00:34] talking about that eagle, you know what?
[2:00:36] I'm just that that that squirrel's
[2:00:38] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[2:00:39] chatter. You made a mistake. You fell.
[2:00:41] You did this. You know what that eagle
[2:00:42] did? He said, "You know what? I'm out of
[2:00:43] here. I'm just tired of it. I don't want
[2:00:45] to listen. I'm out of here." Oh, just
[2:00:47] set your wings, little eagle, and fly.
[2:00:49] Well, some glad morning. Well,

[2:01:10] Heat.
[2:01:15] [Music]
[2:01:19] Heat.
[2:01:35] Heat. Heat.
[2:01:44] [Music]
[2:01:48] Heat.
[2:01:58] Heat. Heat.
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:10] Heat. Heat. Heat.

[2:03:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why we praise
[2:03:06] the Lord? Thank you Jesus. One of these
[2:03:09] [Applause]
[2:03:13] words. We just just want to say a prayer
[2:03:16] of dismissal for those that want to stay
[2:03:17] in worship. Thank you. Just continue to
[2:03:20] seek the Lord. You know, I just we never
[2:03:23] want to dismiss without giving somebody
[2:03:25] an opportunity.
[2:03:27] I I just love the message. You know, God
[2:03:28] placed all the potentials inside of you.
[2:03:32] When two omnipotents meet, well, the
[2:03:33] only thing you need is just to have a
[2:03:35] collision. Amen. You know, Moses had
[2:03:38] that burning bush experience. Every
[2:03:40] single one of God's children's just gots
[2:03:42] to come to that place. Who me? I'm a
[2:03:45] mighty man of valor. Yeah, you. Yeah.
[2:03:48] You don't know what I've put inside of
[2:03:49] you? Let me show you. Just take what you
[2:03:52] got and go. And some of us just say,
[2:03:54] say, "Hey, Lord, I I need to meet you. I
[2:03:57] need to know who I am and who you are."
[2:03:59] You You can ask him right now. He can
[2:04:00] come to you right there. I I've had it
[2:04:03] happen many times. So while we close in
[2:04:06] prayer, you know, we don't want to just
[2:04:07] dismiss you and say, "Oh, we heard a
[2:04:09] nice sermon." Just go. No, you take this
[2:04:11] word into your heart. You feed on it and
[2:04:14] say, "Lord, you're what a partnership.
[2:04:17] What a partnership you're called to." I
[2:04:19] tell you what, if you want a partner,
[2:04:21] there's no better partner.
[2:04:24] And to think that God called you.
[2:04:26] Heavenly Father, we're just so thankful
[2:04:27] for the word that we've heard.
[2:04:30] Lord, we rejoice to think that you've
[2:04:32] called us, Lord, and you elected us and
[2:04:34] you chose us and you placed all the
[2:04:36] potentials right inside of us, Lord.
[2:04:38] That when the word would come, it would
[2:04:40] produce a faith to start believing,
[2:04:42] Lord. And it would unlock all those
[2:04:44] potentials of who we are. That we could
[2:04:46] be omnipotent, Lord, because it's you in
[2:04:48] us. Greater is he that is in us than he
[2:04:51] that is in the world, Lord. We're so
[2:04:53] thankful, Lord. Maybe there's somebody
[2:04:55] here that doesn't know
[2:04:56] you, Lord. May you just come to them.
[2:04:59] May they in their condition right now
[2:05:01] just start to cry out to you and say,
[2:05:02] "Lord, I want to know you more. I I know
[2:05:04] I know a God of history, but I need a
[2:05:06] God of right now. I need a God in my
[2:05:08] trial and my situation. I need a God to
[2:05:10] save me and to deliver me, to heal me. I
[2:05:13] got addictions. I got things that I'm
[2:05:15] battling. Lord, I need you to come,
[2:05:16] Father. Lord, we know that you can come
[2:05:18] to them right now with where they're at
[2:05:20] standing, Lord. You're you're a God of
[2:05:22] grace and mercy and compassion, Lord.
[2:05:24] And we just ask that you just move upon
[2:05:26] their heart right now, Lord. There's
[2:05:28] somebody here that still has a need of
[2:05:29] an affliction. Lord, we just pray you go
[2:05:31] to them. Father, may you minister to
[2:05:33] their needs. Lord, we just love you.
[2:05:35] Pray you be with us as we go. Father, we
[2:05:37] we just are so thankful for your grace
[2:05:39] and your mercy. Lord, may you give back
[2:05:41] to the man of God who stood here and
[2:05:43] ministered. Lord, may you restore back
[2:05:45] to him and continue to give them
[2:05:46] lifegiving, prevailing revelation. Lord,
[2:05:48] we love you. We just pray that you go
[2:05:50] with us as we go our separate ways now.
[2:05:52] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[2:05:54] pray. Amen.
[2:05:58] Pour your spirit out on
[2:06:01] me. Fall just like the
[2:06:05] rain. You are dismissed.
