praise father it's the recognition of your supreme authority it's the ackowledgement that you are the maker and creator of Heaven and Earth that you're all knowing and all seeing and father that we acknowledge that by the footsteps we take and the words that come out of our mouth what it is that we portray and that we illuminate the atmosphere that we create father it's a total consciousness of your presence that's the worship that we want to [Music] have a life that says I belong we ask you to bless the people tonight in our evening Fellowship Lord bless their hearts for sacrificing and making this great effort this evening we ask you to be with us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated I don't know if this is a message here to me it says trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not unto thy own understanding in all the ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path amen I don't know if they're sending me messages up here but I believe every bit of it amen tonight you know where Matthew and is going to share with us brother Daren about their trip and whatever other words that they have on their heart to Fellowship but I think the thing that stir us up is that we never forget the far-reaching power of the gospel and and what it can do and and when it's preached what effect it can have you know you never can pre-qualify somebody as a believer I I I remember how so many of the when we started out in the message we would try to go find the lady with the long hair and the long skirts and and see if they would believe the message you know or or we'd always try to you know find somebody that was as closest to us well they they came right up to it they rejected it and so we try to say this is the type of person that'll hear the gospel and this is the type of person that will uh hear the gospel and maybe the person that would hear the gospel you'll just walk past because you say oh they just can't be a believer you know I wonder how many people would have witnessed to me if if I would have showed up the way that I looked when I was 18 and 19 years old you know you'd say this guy's scary you know we're not going to witness to him but just remember it's not the ground it's the seed amen that seed has been in all kinds of different ground if we went through here with everybody's testimony that was the ground that the seed was in this was the ground the seed was in but the seed is what comes to life and the seed comes to life by hearing the word of God and that's how the gospel spread by hearing blessed are the feet of them that preach the gospel and share the gospel so uh you will here tonight as Matthew shares with you their trip and scriptures and things that are on their hearts of the effect that the gospel has on people the true gospel will have an effect it'll have effect on unbelievers I I've been in hospitals with people people that don't believe in God or anything and they'll ask you to pray they'll bend down their hearts they'll pray with you they'll thank you their whole continence and everything changes because there's just something about the word of God what what is it about the word of God it is God and it's more powerful and sharper and a two-edged sword and there's nothing like it so sit back tonight and enjoy as as the brothers share share with you uh uh the journey you're part of that Journey you helped finance their trip your prayers went with them they went in your name they knew where you who they were a part of and uh some of the people have even tuned in and listened to some of the services so uh uh it's a great thing so you might say I just have this little teeny part that I play but it takes every part playing their part to make it all work we're a body and and this it's a body work a body of Believers and we all share in all of this together so tonight this is not only Matthew and daren's testimony it's your testimony of what God's done through your prayers and your offering and your support so God bless you brother Matthew if you'd come and and uh we just trust the Lord bless you tonight God bless okay praise the Lord here we are happy noty a place to get happy amen well let's just let's just read uh scripture Why Don't We Stand just to um always take the word and um we'll just see how the Lord would lead in this service we just want to share um our trip with you in um India and we'll just uh yes that that message uh Proverbs 3:5 that was for all of us so if we can read that and as I was just um meditating about the trip to India it was kind of um there's just so many Supernatural components to it and uh there was so much going on here um and many uh things were facing here on this side that um the door was open but I I just um trusted the Lord uh because I showed up in India I didn't know where I was going I didn't know anything really I just showed up and uh that's what we have to do is verse five says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lead not to thine own understanding you know there's a way that a man would do something and many times um we like to plan out a vacation or we like to plan things out and it's good to be a planner um but many times uh we find out that our plans are different than God's plans and so we don't want to lean to our own understanding he says' in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths amen we just ask a blessing upon the reading of the word why why we just go before him quickly Lord we just thank you for the reading of your word we know this is a missions report Lord and we know the people will be blessed Lord to see what you have done and in that Lord we're still in your presence there's still needs represented amongst us Lord and you know how to minister Lord so if you would have the right of way this evening and you come Lord you can take the things the testimonies the words that are said and breathe life into the people and you can meet each need still Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart because you are God we commit this to you in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated amen we're just um um just by God's grace can uh well look at that thing go that's terrible yeah thank you for doing that that all right well we're working through some technical difficulties here let's see if we can do this again that worked Christian Life Tabernacle missions report that was the fastest missions report you ever seen God bless you it was good to be [Music] here that's how fast things move in eternity all right so uh just want to give a mission report on India uh as you know um there's a Brother Sam who uh he he was coming out of Pentecost he's down in the Houston area and he started to research the message he heard about our church and he came all the way up here to be baptized properly in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he's still down in the Houston area and he believes this message with all his heart and he's doing what he can to spread the gospel and to witness to those and go to churches and I had kept up uh in fellowship and in touch with brother Brother Sam and he um let me know about some things he was doing he was doing some Zoom calls and had some contacts that he he had in India and wanted me to come on and so we came on and uh was encouraged by the word that he was presenting because he was um you know you can be you can be uh sometimes you're leery or you want to have discernment or wonder what's this all about and um you know I was encouraged that he was he was playing the message of the hour and a gap tape from Hindi uh from English into Hindi and I thought well that's okay now we're we're doing something and some people would say you're cooking with grease or you're cooking with I'm like all right this is this is what where it's all about so we spent some time on a couple of the zoom calls and then I I just you know something you got to be a fruit inspector and um I just thought if the doors open and they're if they're sticking around to hear the word of God we need to get those people in India connected with the bride body in India because there's nothing like the body of Christ the body will will minister to the needs it'll uplift it'll it'll guide it'll encourage and so that's why it's so important to be a part of a body God gives you a pastor and a five-fold Ministry and then each one of you that are living out the word of God you're a testimony and a strength and a burden Bearer and when you come into the body that it'll fit every need supplieth and and and every one of you are unique and fitly joined together and so I just thought in my heart I know in India that that um there's many um Believers in India who have uh embraced the message of the hour and there's established churches so in my heart my goal really in going to India is I wanted to connect to these contacts with the body in India because I know uh I can't go evangelize India I can't go there and it's a big place and a lot of people over 1.3 billion people in India and so I just um I told the brothers in our context I said I'm willing to go and they said we'll have you and um it it turned out that they we'll come you come and we'll set up meetings and it turned into where um you know they would have maybe made the meetings as big as uh you would allowed them um but uh they started talking about well we can to have one to 200 ministers come and and uh we'll have um um and at first they wanted us to maybe go into the villages and certain places but I I was like well no we that might not be the way to go and I need to get in touch with somebody and I got in touch with uh brother Craig Boer I was in fellowship with him and he um got me in touch with a brother Roshan over in uh Punjab and he was our contact to have boots on the ground in India he is a he is an established uh believer he's a pastor there and um I Heard great testimony about those things so I got in touch with uh brother Roshan and said hey this is what we're looking to do I need your help uh to organize and to um meet with these men and to see if you can arrange these meetings and um My Brother David you know he he um came to me and was you know hey you know you're going to India you know and there could be a lot of downfalls and pitfalls there and and I just you know I remember telling him I say I I got the Holy Ghost over in India and he's like okay if you got the Holy Ghost in India we good because hey that's what it's all about right and brother Roshan just filled with the Holy Ghost and so I knew if if he was helping I would be okay and so really I just left it in his hands and um we were busy here and all of a sudden it was time to go to India and I was going to India and I needed somebody to go with me Hallelujah brother Daren had it on his heart to go and so he was able to go and I I want to say it was a very um uh packed trip um this is how our trip started um we left at 9:30 in the morning I believe on on Thursday and um we we we here we go we we flew into Newark New Jersey for some reason and had to drive an hour to JFK where we caught a plane for about 15 hours over to Delhi and we landed in Delhi to find out we had a 78 hour bus ride to go to uh jalandar where brother Roshan picked us up and then we drove about another hour to his place arriving Saturday morning at 8:00 a. and then we would uh Minister the following Sunday and we're going to keep traveling so I'll give give you a quick overview but you can just see how um this trip kind of unfolded we took about 10 flights um and uh to cover the ground and go to these meetings where we could um this is over in our first set of meetings in Patna and uh bear which I believe I spelled bear wrong that should be an H there um and then we would we had to connect through Delhi for everything and the security over there is not security here it's ran by the military and they they are military and one terminal is out of the airport back into another terminal and we had to go through that every time so then we're taking another we're flying down into udar for our meetings in bonsoir this was the second set of meetings with ministers each meeting had about 100 to 200 ministers uh mostly Pentecostal ministers in the meeting and then uh it was quite a long drive down from the airport about four hours and as I'll show later that just because something's 20 minutes or 20 miles away in India doesn't mean you can get there in 20 minutes um and we'll uh we'll take some time maybe to show some things just want want you to be a part of it so brother Stanley is a pastor in Mumbai uh he came with us to our meeting there on the North side at a Pentecostal uh Church there in North Mumbai and he was a great host enjoyed uh meeting him and so as you could see there was a lot of travel here that took place in about 12 days and I just wanted to do this to give you a little uh Insight on the travel and the ground that we covered um we spent a lot of time in cars and on an airplane and and uh in order to cover the ground we did and I tell you what there was nothing like getting back in the United States I was happy to be there you know uh you were close to home I when I got back in the States I was like you know brother brother Darion knows New York if we I started using you I have t uh TSA you know uh uh pre-check so I was with him through every line I got back on the back side of the trip I'm like you're on your own I'm we're in America now and I mean when we were out in the middle of nowhere in India you know we stuck close together we got back in America I felt like we were in our backyard like hey buddy you're on your own so I'm going to have uh brother Daren come and uh just uh maybe give a little a testimony of maybe what he uh experienced or what stood out to him and um I'll have him come at this time amen greet everyone in the wonderful and precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ s your privilege to stand before God's people people his bride elected not just here but also around the world um part of that elected called out people in this end time and the hour that we're living in that is so so crucial you know um um a few weeks before um uh the Bible study brother Matthew's Friday mornings we have the Bible study the Lord was dealing with me on some Q&A questions and answers preaching 122359 and I was like Lord I'm going through stuff at work why are you giving this but anyway long story short after Bible study Friday that Friday morning brother Matthew I go to his office because I wanted to talk to Brother Gary about something brother Matthew goes hey just the man the Lord LED in my heart to come and talk to I'm thinking to myself I'm not going to India but when the Lord takes things and turns your world upside down to perform his will you better make sure it's him so what I did was I obviously said as you did for Gideon Lord do for me first let the carton be dry and the ground around it be wet the next day let the carton be wet and the ground around to be wet uh dry so I put all these things in front of the Lord looking in the Bible in the scripture to make sure that I didn't want to go with brother Matthew as an obstacle but as an encouragement and as a witness because there were prayers for a companion for brother Matthew to go so God had to answer that request how I came into the play I don't know but that's God's business I'll ask you when I get there one day and you know it's it's amazing how God worked everything out to see God's hand just move obstacles move things in such a way that you cannot help but say this has got to be the Lord so you all have a Bible right if you want to raise it up come on hold it up so here's one of the first eye openening things that we experienc there we walking out of our church right with our Bibles in we walk around everywhere with our Bibles in our hand in India here's what we had to do hide your Bible you speak a word about God and Christianity you're getting to jail no questions asked like brother Matthew said the military was at the airport those guys had live ammo AK-47s they were not asking questions it was real so that is where God sent us for a purpose you know and as Brother David mentioned you all part of that if your prayers didn't go before us and go with us we would not be able to be as successful as we've been by God's grace he led us to brother Roshan Brother P wonderful Believers because just as our prayers on this side was Lord send us to the right people their prayers on that side was Lord send us the right people so the God was working on both ends and we were watching the hand of the Lord each step of the way you know brother Matthew was uh to say the least I I I told him and no disrespect to him or our pastor I love them I respect them I appreciate them I said I thought I left your dad here all the way there and back man I'm telling you what you'll see what I mean once he goes through the slides but um you know I want to apologize again to my wife this is what she put together for me on our trip of course I didn't do that I did my own little stupid thing but God received the glory to get back to the reality of this mission trip brothers and sisters to the way it went was we would start the services at 9:00 in the morning and then there'd be a what we would call uh chai time where they'll have their chai tea and then brother Roshan would take the second part then they have lunch come back with some more preaching and then there's Q&A from 9: until 6:00 at night two Services wherever we went now you think it's easy to preach that long and then add to that the enemy attacking your body I don't know how brother Matthew did it I know he doesn't know this but I don't know how God kept him throughout all that it was what third or fourth day when we got the food poisoning brother Matthew went through rigors I mean I saw it like the S the F the second service we had we had lunch came back and he started shaking that evening like uncontrollably I know what rigers is because I had suffered of that too the Lord is sending a guy with an immune compromise system to a country where there's so many things going on what are you doing that is God working and the whole time I was watching the hand of God what brother Matthew was starting out with brother Roshan would continue the next day would be well the first day would always be the same thing the baptism and then the tri Doctrine head on Boom knocked the devil right off his socks and the next day was let me introduce you to a messenger as there was no as was Moses this is a new messenger and the message was introduced brothers and sisters you I mean I told Brother Matthew if we should go again sign me up Lord worthy because it was immense intense yes 14 flights 12 days backtack Services hardly enough time to rest and sleep or even eat some days we didn't even eat I know there were a couple of days where I didn't eat anything but a couple of pieces of Fruit l 14 pounds and I'm trying to keep it off but we do thank you for all your prence your support it was really a blessed trip and um the people we met there brothers and sisters they are just on fire for the Lord you see in the slides that brother Matthew will present there'll be some scenaries where um you see the intensity of the the Believers taking notes now these are preachers pastors of churches they are taking notes from the morning to the evening asking when we had the when there was a Q&A they would just ask the questions and boom answer answer right to this scripture because you couldn't share the message of the hour yet was scripture first that's where we went all the way to scripture brother Matthew and and the other preacher we went to the scripture every single time and you could see the Enemy being defeated every single time like that just like that boom boom boom and the next day was introduction to here's a message that God sent a prophet it was just unbelievable so I thank the Lord for making me a part of this even though I went Kicking and Screaming I do thank him for his grace and his Mercy brother Matthew if anybody wants a gift idea for brother Daren he brought this to India he needed a carryon bag just for his Bible I mean that's hey at least he brought the the right thing he brought the word of God Amen if if uh if I forget to share this part he talked about questions and answers and there was some uh you know there was definitely people opposing and some Elders that were asking questions um that were trying to cause problems and uh one of the organizers was getting really worried and I told him I said brother Chandon don't worry I said we're teaching the people how to fight I said because they're going to go back to their Villages they're going to go back to their churches go back to their elders and they're all going to challenge them and they're going to have to answer the questions themselves I said so let them ask the question we're teaching them how to fight and if you know I almost wanted to maybe you know you want to know what we believe look into the Bible and um we'll just try to continue before we get all fired up so as uh brother Daren alluded to it was a long journey so there were times we felt funny and there was times we looked funny and I have to say this is probably my most favorite picture of the tree I mean look at brother Daren I mean that's awesome I believe he he he he called back to his wife or something like that and when he got off the phone he had taken off the tie because uh I know she didn't have that in mind when she packed for him but I mean that is some color and if you'll notice on the bottom there it says I do not speak Hindi because everybody talked to brother Darion in Hindi and I would just laugh matter of fact they tried to split us up at the airport one time and we're like he's with him he's like but that's okay go go he doesn't speak Hindi the military guy goes he don't speak Hindi like no so he he he finally got tired of explaining himself so if he had a sign to hold up in Hindi that would have been it I do not speak Hindi and as you can see I didn't want to uh leave my brother out uh to drive by himself so I threw up a funny picture of myself that happened so um long trip we got into as you as we said I don't know we'd probably been traveling about 24 25 hours and we got to Deli and this uh brother here brother pip as we would have thought was brother pip um was there to receive us brother Roshan um um like I said I showed up at the airport and I called brother Roshan and said I'm here and he's like okay I wasn't able to make it here's a picture of the guy that's going to pick you up send me your picture so I sent a picture and I walked out of the airport and U you know especially in areas like that you know you have a little Street Smart you you don't make eye contact with people because everybody wants to sell you carry your bags they want to they want to give you a tour of India and and so I just I just avoided the crowd right away and little did I know there was a guy holding up a sign with my name on it I'm never the guy with a with with that's looking for somebody holding up my name with a sign so I got around to the the side I called brother ocean and he got a hold of um brother pip and he found us and we connected and so then as little did I know we we thought we were going to be getting on a plane to to go to um Punjab but we found out that that plane was cancelled and so we had about a seven eight hour bus ride so we we flew all I don't know we'd been traveling 24 26 hours and showed up you know ready for a hotel and it's like NOP we got an 8 hour bus ride I'm like well praise the lord well when I sh showed up the reason I shared that scripture is because when I tell you you you when I showed up there and didn't really um know all what was going on I I said brother Darion one word you're we're gonna have to get really familiar with is TR r s t trust and so we got on this uh bus ride and it's about um like I said with the stops about eight hours heading from Deli up towards Punjab and I'm talking to what I believe is brother deep and I'm like well so how long have you known brother ran and he looks at me goes well I don't know him I'm like you you don't know brother rashan he's like no I don't know him I'm like huh and I looked over at brother Darren he's like trust here I am in the middle of India on a bus the guy I'm with doesn't know where I'm so so and what was he was supposed to be my interpreter and the guy sitting next to him started interpreting for for for us back to him so um and and then after talk well how long have you lived in Punjab and everything got got around to it and it was all about accent he doesn't know brother rashan but he knows brother Roshan so I was in the right place I was on the right bus with the right guy he knows brother Roshan so I I learned to pronounce his name properly it's brother Roshan you'll find a lot of Americans pron pronounce his name amongst the brothers here we'll say brother Roshan we carry that out but it's brother Roshan so we ironed that out real quick and I was like okay we're in the right place so we we drove all the way up like I said about 8 hours we left uh 9:30 a.m. Thursday morning traveled for about 35 hours to get to uh to gandar where brother Roshan picked us up and brought us to his house about a 45 minute another hour drive to his house and um we showed up there about 8 in the morning on Saturday and so um we there uh Saturday was uh you know after a long travel like that we're going to rest a little bit but there was some things we had to to do and this is where we met uh brother peush which was very instrumental uh I mean I can't even begin to tell you how instrumental brother PE was he was he was everything on the journey he we he he took care of all the finances all the uh all the taxes I mean he just he he did everything uh and these brothers carried our bags they were just so uh wonderful I can't say enough about brother peush and brother rosan um and these are real missionaries themselves uh brother Roshan has been I think to over 25 maybe 30 countries and he had done so much travel that God dealt with his heart and he just said you know I need to do this in my own country and so I don't know how many years that's been over that's transpired but for years now he's been laboring right there in India to get the gospel in the native language to his people and so if there was a person or a brother in India God got us to the right man for the job and so we were um uh that's brother peush and brother Roshan and um I don't know why this keeps doing that I'm trying to tap lightly here I don't know where we're at we just fired right ahead all right we'll try to be diligent here and just touch it it worked all right this is a picture of brother Roshan and sister proma um in front of their Church uh we were only at his place for one night uh but they took really good care of us so we got in um that Saturday rested met with Brother PE and them and then we had service um Sunday morning and this is a picture of their uh congregation brother Roshan was born in into a Pentecostal family and heard about the message and he is the only if I could say it this way Christian convert in his whole assembly probably has some 250 um Believers or more but all of them have been converted out of Hinduism or sism so that uh no Christian converts all of these were converted right out of um the main belief there in his country and uh here's a little uh picture just of us uh We've we've completed so like I said we got in on Saturday we ministered Sunday morning and they prepared a wonderful lunch by behind they have a fellowship hall in the back there but now our journey is is is going we're going to now get uh travel about two or three hours up to the airport where we'll stay that night and then um we'll get up at 3:45 in the morning to start our journey over to um Patton which is in bear um so back to Delhi and now we're going to come over for our first set of meetings um on Monday which start um in Patna um and by the time all the traveling was done we got to the hotel and maybe had an hour before we had to go to the meetings the meetings started at 4M and so um everything and by this time um it's showing on brother Darion and uh you know I've been through the ringer a few times on on overseas work and it it'll you know you just uh you got to roll with the punches that's for sure um so just to show where we're at in India so those four stars represents the very top one in Punjab there and uh um is where brother Roshan is and then this will be our first set of meetings here in bear in the town called patma atna and um I just wanted to um show you that the hotel the from the hotel to the meetings I think was only three miles um but getting there was was a little bit of a challenge um because there are no rules really other than don't get hit and if you have a horn you use it everybody I mean if you hear this it's just everybody's beeping everybody's beeping and so um it took us a little longer to get certain places you'd look it up oh that's five miles away but um five miles could uh that that could be an adventure needless to say so and I and I had another one I I just to show you because this was on the way to the meetings and it took us a little bit longer to get there and you'll just notice people walking beeping honking driving or you know and and you look over here on the left and all the motorcycles will will just go through every little Gap and then you'll find out people will be walking through the Gap at the same time of motorcycles and um you uh um you have to be really uh diligent and and uh uh watching your surroundings as as you would I mean you just weave in and out of motorcycles and I mean it's amazing it's Controlled Chaos at its finest so that was um that was about how it would happen and so now we've gotten through the traffic we're pulling up to our first set of meetings and this was in a nice uh a a Christian School complex or a a Bible College maybe not a Bible College some type of a religious college that um Chandon was able to secure for us to have the meeting so I wanted to show you this walk into was a nice uh facility here at this place uh we're going to be housing about 150 ministers um uh food and and housing and before I continue uh much further uh brother mangit was a a a very uh enormous um blessing in uh feeling the need to help um provide for the financial responsibilities over there and so I just want to let him know it was a it was a great need we committed to this trip and it came at a time where um all the help we we received was just a tremendous blessing so this is the first facility that we're we're at and also brother Tommy and just certain ones and our pastor and each one of you that all gave uh uh was just uh all every bit of it that you contributed if it wasn't financially with your prayers was a big help and so um here is uh this is as we just got there brother Chandon was there uh to meet us he was the contact that Brother Sam had so um the Brother Sam was visiting a Pentecostal Church in Houston and he um he was trying to witness and he went to the church and he made a contact UM with somebody that was visiting from India in the Houston area and that's how all of this started to transpire you never know how God will will will use something as long you always want to be so in one planet one water but God gives the increase you always want to be sewing seed and and looking for lost souls brother chanon was there uh to meet us and um um this would start our meetings um man this thing is interesting doesn't work too good every time does it but that's okay the devil's fighting the devil's fighting he's a defeated foe technical difficulties can be good sometimes you know all right let's see if we can get back this thing's a little finicky I guess well that's just amazing amazing maybe we'll just have the brothers uh do it we'll have to say next can y'all help me out Brothers all right here we go we'll we'll abandon the uh it worked good for a little bit all right we we pass this now all right that's okay everybody feeling all right praise the Lord all right we're moving along all right so this was customary for them uh they like to uh give you some flowers a lay um and welcome you in it's part of the custom next slide um and this just is a little picture of the Gathering continue and this is just a a short audio clip [Music] okay next clip so this is the Gathering we had about um you know at least a hundred ministers and pastors here um in in these meetings and um we we just uh we didn't really um like I said we just showed up there and um before you know it I mean with all the travel and everything you're at the meetings and they're saying hey come come come up and um I had I had thought about you know um it's it's very different you know you're going to speak to 100 200 ministers and pastors um they're uh mostly in Pentecostalism and uh going to have false doctrines and things and so I it's not like you prepare a sermon um or or anything like that so we just went with our Bible and one thing that had resonated uh with me was was something that uh brother brandom said he said in the last age we've come back you know to the Capstone Revelation that Jesus Christ is Lord and and I just was meditating on the Capstone Revelation and some of those uh the principal things that we believe and just in my heart um uh would want to just see how the Lord would lead if you can go to the next slide and so this is Brother Roshan preaching um just wanted you to maybe hear the delivery and how um the services would go [Music] [Music] and so um what was really neat is I the way it happened is I took I would take the first um service and just to to start um speaking and you know really uh uh I I just started to maybe just tell about my how my candle got lit you know it just because you're at the witnessing at somebody's table or to a coworker at work the word of God works what did the prophet say just tell them how your candle got lit so just because you're in front of 200 ministers doesn't change the formula sir the word of God works it works every time so if you want a witness to somebody or you want somebody to believe the message of the hour tell them how your candle got lit don't become a theologian I got this all figured out I got this quote I'm gonna tie it all together you're just gonna you're just gonna sound like all the white noise of everybody telling them you are you should believe what I believe you can't get warm by a painted fire so you can explain the message all you want but if you start to tell them how something's changed your life they'll listen and they'll see you know what they have something I don't have and we just started there and and by God's grace the Holy Ghost came and um we found oursel hitting the trinitarian doctrine and water baptism headon and start to lay in the principles of what we believe and and what we have to do I is is show me in the Bible um you know I can't say brother brandham said right and and I and maybe we could have more to say about that later but what we have to do is show in the Bible and the only reason I can show in the Bible is because we received a Vindicated Prophet to show us in the Bible and so what was amazing is as we would um lay in there and and um where I would stop whatever scripture orever place I was at brother Roshan would just get up there and continue right right with it and so it it was it was very neat just to see it didn't matter really uh uh uh the glove if I could say it like that God was just uh walking the people through the scriptures and and uh I wouldn't have had this on there but the the brothers uh pushed me to have a a clip of of me saying something um come with words of there's wisdom my preaching wasn't what I could figure out with my life but my preaching was ow [Music] Administration you can be changed and you can be filled with the Holy Ghost you can receive a new nature yeah they all liked that until I started hitting their pet doctorine yeah yeah we all do it we're all guilty of it all agree and say we all believe we all believe but let somebody get to where you're living and then it's like wait a second I thought we were friends no I am your friend that's why I'm getting where you're liveing that's what the word of God should do and um brother random had made this statement um he said uh preach the gospel Mark 16 preach the gospel to Every Creature what is that in other words demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost had to be now watch to every not just teach the word he never said go teach the word he said go preach the gospel not teach the word preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe this gospel in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they would not take up uh they they would take up serpents or drink deadly things and it wouldn't harm them if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and they went forth said the scripture preaching everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following that's the gospel the gospel on display and you know it was uh uh quite as I you know thought about the trip I was thinking about well you know I I'm I'm not qualified you know or you I'm going to be standing in front of 100 200 ministers and um you know when you when you have an absolute you always go to it you know you always go to the word of God and and um I took a lot of of of encouragement in that quote just preach the gospel okay Lord I'm not may maybe I I'll just go let you have your way Lord you know I'll just go preach the gospel you don't have to start doing something differently oh be what God made you go uh the Holy Girl still bring it to you as you have need of it and so that's kind of that's just how the the the trip went and um here um uh before we move into this slide um so we the first day there in patana um uh we I we the first day we got there at 4 we had three services I took two of them we had questions and answers and then the next day um uh I took the first first service brother uh Roshan took the second one and then the third service um we blew the place up um we uh did another questions and answers we had a time where some of the elders and them were were were standing up and they were saying well we've we've received the Holy Ghost and we've already been baptized in the titles and um so we had already plainly walked through scriptures showing all the scenarios and circumstances of of of water baptism and I just took the Bible and I said you know what I I I I said I can't tell you to what to do with the word alls I can do is give you the word and I said and if you're telling me you've been baptized in the titles father son Holy Ghost and and you have the Holy Spirit I said your testimony doesn't match the Bible we're not we're not we're not here to you know we're here to tell the truth right because it's the truth that'll make you free and um we we we we then challenge them on water baptism and challenge them I said show me in the Bible challenge them with and I and I lifted up by you show me any different way I said everyone and we dealt with Revelation and Peter having the Revelation and with that Revelation what he did we could all these things as our pastor was saying this we know all these things but now we're showing it in the Bible you have to be able to show it in the Bible and as we challenged all them then to be baptized properly three people stood up and um I thought well you know pray praise God one soul is worth 10,000 worlds well there was some of the elders in the congregation and so I told the three to come forward and we went out and um and then I had to go back in and get something when I came back out brother R's like well all they they they want to get baptized also and by that time the whole hallway had full filled up and I was like which ones want to get baptized he said all of them and so we had about 60 to 70 ministers standing in the hallway that all wanted to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so now we we have to find a place to baptize him and if there was any place I didn't want to be in India was in a river yeah yeah Lord knows so um where there was some concern some of the brothers had already been arrested and um arrested for baptism and things like that so uh they said look brother Matthew you being out there um you know um being from America and being the white man it's going to cause so much attention and stir he's like it it probably not not good that um you do it so um there's a there's a place that you can stand and look out and you can watch from afar and I thought hey Hallelujah wait I didn't say that who was that guy just talking so I'm up there on this this uh Lookout and I'm filming this and so I wanted y'all to just to get a a little view of this River this is the gangus river uh this is a holy River to them this is uh something that is very sacred to them I think they they will put the loved ones in this River to carry them away um and as you look off the back we we got all these uh little buggies you'll see a picture of one of those um later but all the brothers we we hired out all these taxis if you don't say Uber premium you're going to get one of those little buggy show up take you somewhere so that's all the brothers coming off the buggies they're going to start uh their little Trek across the sand and uh start going down towards the water um but there's anti-conversion laws there so um you got to be careful we weren't wanting to bring a bunch of attention being that this was a holy River and a popular place for people to come um it it was there was some obstacles and challenges there um and so um this is just another clip showing us getting onto the boats um because by God's grace this there were some boats over there that were for higher and uh one of the brothers had the idea you know if we can get on these boats and um go to the other side and uh I remember after it was all said and done you know we got about 45 um people over there and after it was all sudden done they they told me how much it was I'm like it cost how much and then I found out it was only $40 us I'm like that's pretty good so um that's everybody getting on the boat there and so what we did is we um we we got in these little boats here on the Gish River and if you could see how it looks white practically behind the boats it it's hard to breathe in some of the places um I I don't know if it was just the time of year maybe somebody had mentioned that um maybe weather was building but the smog and the pollution was just down in the town it looked like the whole place was on fire everywhere he went you could smell it I mean you could you could you couldn't see anything we were looking at the maps and uh brother Gary's like did you see the mountains I like you couldn't see a skyscraper across the street you know you you couldn't really see that far off and you can tell that Haze back there um that the the they burn a lot of things and there's so U much population there that U the air quality there's a real problem um yall should be thankful for the air that we have in Dallas Fort Worth and I don't even mean that sarcastically one bit um so this is um we had to move quickly um so we about 30 of the brothers that wanted to get baptized had to catch AE TR to get back to their part of the country so about 30 of them made it out and uh we finally got set up and um I wanted you just to see some of the baptisms because you're a part of this and so it was just one after another um coming into the water and baptizing them and um as you can see we had to move very quickly I mean just one after another yes I sped it up a little bit because I I for the sake of time I wanted you to be able to see but these brothers are just coming out one after another baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ uh was just a tremendous uh Victory and the love divine uh to have the opportunity was was an amazing blessing um one thing that was about this trip that that encouraged me really was the one thing that settled my heart from the very beginning is all the men that I was involved with weren't trying to build their own kingdom Brother Sam was like brother if the Holy Ghost leads you go you go eat every brother nobody was pressing to to get a notch in their belt or to to to be the guy or anything like that everything was just let the Lord have his way and and that really gave a great peace on this trip and um so this was brother brother Darion was our um our videographer here um and so just wanted you to actually see some of the baptisms taking place sure so when you see these brothers coming in groups they had to do it for a purpose couldn't have too many people crowded and then also some of them changed clothes and handed their pants and their shirt to the others to go and get baptized well now you know I didn't even know that yeah so they were trying to just not cause too much attention um as we would travel over there because everybody I was wanting to be um um aware of the political climate and the anti-conversion laws um so we we uh completed the baptisms and this might not be too pleasing to the ear to to hear this but I just wanted to share this with you because it it was a special moment coming back on the boat and brother Roshan let me said these brothers just want to praise the Lord in their native tongue and uh I don't they didn't even really know the language from what I understand but these these SE ones were from the same Village and they just uh they wanted to start praising the Lord and I wanted to share that with [Music] you y'all were on us on this boat so each one of you was with us [Music] so I thought that was just really uh a neat experience uh coming back on that boat and them just praising the Lord in their native tongue we we we baptized 29 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 29 ministers and pastors so that was a tremendous Victory and this was our ride back to the uh the meeting place and I actually drove that thing um you know when you ride in the front the steering wheel or the you know the whatever you call those things are right there and you're kind of both sitting up there and he's like leaning over like this I'm like let me give that a try and so uh that's a scary place to drive I just let you know that much so we just arrived back in that buggy that is a very very Cal mode of transportation there so brother Matthew driving 35 miles hour three of us sitting in the back no seat belts and brother Matthew's driving there's a pothole we're dead that's how it went no you can't go before God's time I mean that is that is the word of God there was no pothole going to take us out however we want to be uh we want to be good stewards of what God has given us so so uh and it he's he's making that out to be something else uh than it was it was just a brief moment but we did it so we're back here um at uh the meeting's now coming to a close we got there on Monday this was on Tuesday and now um we're all about to say our goodbyes this is a a last final picture of the brothers that got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we're just so thankful for that [Applause] so now we're going to head back to uh the hotel I I thought to leave this out but then I I I wanted to include it because this was one this is one of our contacts that Brother Sam has made um in uh bear uh this was brother Alex and his son to his right and his wife they drove two hours just to have dinner with us and um he he's an overseer of 400 churches and several orphanages and um he uh wanted to meet us and so he was going to be in the meetings but through the I guess through customary he was supposed to be invited by the the local organizer and and we had invited him but that never happened so he he was a little reluctant to come but we at least ranged this meeting and um you know a long story short he basically asked me why I was in India you know you know just wondering you know um and he found out you know as I started to share with him um you know as I I started to um start to lay in there there's just uh there's no beating around the bush you know I came to India because I have a message and the message wasn't given to me it was given to a Vindicated Prophet who fulfilled Malachi 45 Luke 1730 Revelations 10 1-7 that's why I'm in India because I want you to know that God sent a prophet and we started started to walk down through the scriptures through Noah and Moses and John the Baptist and we uh went through serpent seed and it was about that time his son got up and came around and pulled his chair up right in between us and was feeding on on the truth and and as the Bible um was just uh opening to them as we shared these things um I thought it was you know as we started to talk to him even just to go further into no eternal hell and and pred destination and we had to spend some time on there because you find out um people get um a religious uh understanding of the scriptures and so um my we're so blessed if if the Lord would allow maybe later for for us to just know how blessed we are to have received the message of the hour which took a book that was closed and opened it and and many people think they know what they're looking at but really it's through a warped understanding of what men have probed at over the years and Satan through religion and an antichrist Spirit has presented a seed of discrepancy and the people have took it for truth and they're damned believing a lie that might be cutting but that's why there was a need for a prophet that's why we're in India that's why we should be at the gas station that's why we should be letting everybody know cuz people are believing in something that's been hybrid and it brings forth death and we have the answer we have the solution to all their problems it's the message of the hour and unfortunately now when we say a phrase like that I'm shocked that people somehow have missed what the message is the message is the Lord Jesus Christ and God sent a prophet to introduce us to the Lord Jesus Christ so when we say the message I'm not talking about anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ so um we we had this great opportunity to to to go through those things and to and and and he was as we shared that I I feel the Liberty just to say it even if it was to come into his ears I'm okay with it because as I would read out of Ephesians i' say as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world I said when did he choose us he says well because he was fighting against something I said I I understand brother I said but let me just read it again according as he is when did he choose us and he said well I said brother Alex I know you believe the Bible I said I'm just reading the Bible I I'm not spinning it I'm not trying to trying to work it any other way I'm just going to read what Paul said you believe the Bible he goes yeah I said according as his chosen us when for the foundation of the world and it got down to the heart of the matter he said but then what's the meaning of life but what's the meaning of life I said oh Lord help me I said brother I said there came a time in your union with your wife that you wanted to have a son is that the truth he said yes it's the truth I said and was he in you he saides he was in me I said but there had to come a time where that which was in you came into manifestation so you can have fellowship with the very thought you wanted to have fellowship with and he said yes I said that's the purpose of meaning in life I said I said if your son had need of anything I said would you not take care of it he said yes I said if you if I said would you leave your son to to burn or go into he and I started walking through I said why because you love him and I said now what about a gape love I said he would predestinate you he would make there sure there was no way what's the the meaning of life is God had attributes in him that he wanted to have fellowship with and you're the very manifestation of that attribute and now he can have fellowship with his sons and his daughters what's the meaning of life [Music] Hallelujah but Satan has has Twisted truths like this in the peoples of mine I'll never forget one time I don't know how we got to preaching I'll never forget the time that I shared this with with a oh she was a a Godly Pentecostal sister and and and um I come to find out she on her way to church she she was holding her uh six-month old baby and they got in a car wreck and she lost her husband and her six-month old baby and and I was just thinking about that that that six-month old baby and I said you know praise God for predestination cuz I was thinking you're going to meet him again I was want to encourage her in the word and I said the wrong thing because there's a false doctrine that predestination is everything you do is already I was predestinated to pick that up I was pre and so what I was telling her is that God ordained that and and and and Satan knows how to to to twist the word of God where people don't want it when it's the very thing that'll save you and give you peace and will minister to your needs and help you through the hard times and through the trial so we had a wonderful opportunity just to to share what we believe and show home in the Bible we we walked through Genesis we we we walked through water B we walked through these things and where was it all Lan in the Bible you want to know what we believe look into the Bible so that was um that evening I believe which was Tuesday uh and then we would start our journey um from Patna to [Music] bonara um so already a power packed uh trip and now we are going to um fly back to Delhi and then we're going to fly into udar um and then uh it took about three or four hours to get from there down to bons suara um oddly enough um and this is um by the time we got down um there now it's uh Wednesday but we traveled all day um from those flights and getting um there uh down we got there late evening uh just in time to to get by God's grace when we had arranged these meetings you know I I let brother Roshan know I said hey we we want to try to have good accommodations um uh Western accommodations would be appreciated and so um they they did just a fantastic job of of making arrangements but um but you know that um Western culture we we have toilets and uh two-thirds of the world don't they don't have those and and so um you know we get spoiled in certain ways and so I I wanted to be spoiled while I was there hey so I wanted some uh hopefully to get it well we finally showed up to a place where my room was supposed to be non-smoking but it wasn't and uh after a long day of travel I got to my room and they said we'll bring you hot water in a bucket and I'm like oh great I guess it's good to have hot some hot water than no hot water at all and so I didn't have any hot water the room but thankfully I had some brothers that had a room just down the hallway that had hot water ain't that right brother Darion and so um the next day uh would start our meetings here and now we're in um uh really south of bonaro for these meetings and uh it's in uh Rajon I believe is the way you pronounce the state so over in India uh there it's split up into States so when we say uh Punjab that is the state to the north then we were in bear that was the state over to uh the East and now we're in rajastan which banswara is in rajesthan and U now we're uh onto uh a two-day set of meetings with about 120 130 um ministers here and so this is uh just a little I wanted to show you a little footage of uh the grounds this is just out in a little village and there was a church that was built there um that we were able to um make the accommodations and as we start walking towards the church you'll notice a building to the right that's where all the ministers that stayed there they all just slept in sleeping bags u in that space for the ones that stayed [Music] so this was customary this is uh brother Darion getting his turban and uh this is all of us um in our um turban and our lays and if you'll notice to my uh to darion's right um as you're looking at the screen you'll be SEC second to the right right um uh that's brother giio who was our contact for this set of meetings and for our meeting in Mumbai and all the way um to the left um would be the local Pastor um who helped arrange uh the meeting in that area and so this is now going to set up the meetings we're going to come in uh and now we have um two services in the morning two so we call them services but really I would go maybe an hour and a half or so then we take a what they would call a tea break and then brother Roshan would go so we would we'd probably go about four hours um and then we'd have a lunch and then we'd go for another four hours and have questions and answers um and just uh so that's the uh setting the stage for these meetings here um that's the interior of the the [Music] church they're singing songs as all the minist are coming in for the service [Music] [Music] H [Music] H and so I this is going to be a little clip of brother Roshan preaching uh but uh as brother Darian alluded to these brothers really had a real hunger for the word of God and would lay in there uh writing down notes and underlining scriptures and really paying attention uh to the word of God and so you'll just you'll see um their attentiveness and also one time the power went out and uh the service just kept going right on in the dark um it was I have a clip of that but uh I think we maybe can show you that another time [Music] [Music] [Music] it was a it was it was a joy to work with um um brother brother oan um he was there was talking about um the attributes Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tku and then talking about Jehovah yashu manifested in the flesh and um I this was the trip where we we we got sick I wasn't able to make the next day um we came down really bad the night before um and it was really interesting God works everything out uh for the good um because I'm working through an interpreter so it takes twice as long uh to say it and the second day oddly enough the local pastor and um um the organizer um they they weren't able to make it uh to the service and so um so brother Roshan just took his his time and the day and it was the last day we we had we had um everything you know you could feel everything was building to just you know really drop the bomb you know uh we lay everything out there you know the need for a prophet and come down to the present day truth and what we had ministered on I just went there with the the thought in my mind of of the revelation of Jesus Christ and how the the that comes from the word apocalypse which is an unveiling and how something is covered and has to be um unveiled and so we are just laying that through scriptures and and how what it took for an unveiling and the next day brother Roshan came in and took the day introduced uh them to the message of the hour and now um they all were in agreements of the need of a prophet now we're getting all of them the uh the the church age book so that was another uh all 130 uh ministers and pastors all want the church age book and we're receptive to the teachings of the message of the hour so I tell you what an opportunity isn't that [Applause] wonderful so now we're finishing up in um Rajon here we're going to start our journey back towards um the airport um we so we drive it we finished uh the the meeting there um I believe this would have now been Friday um so we're going to drive about 4 or five hours and feeling like I did oh we needed the help of God and then we'd stay that night and then um Saturday morning we flew to Mumbai um and so now we're there uh this is Saturday um that's uh the next day then we drove up for the meetings on Sunday in Mumbai uh brother Stanley was there there to uh pick us up and uh when we got in um on Saturday that really was the first day where we had an evening uh of of rest there was nothing scheduled so um and by that time brother Daren was filling uh fing filling it as well and so it was very much needed I tell you one thing you don't want to be doing when and this isn't like you know um you get a little bad food at a at a restaurant here you know sometimes overseas you can take up something that'll mess you up for quite a while and um so we were just I appreciate y'all's prayers and and the concern and uh the Lord certainly was was gracious to us last thing you want to do is hop in a car for four or five hours to get on an airplane you know but uh you're just trusting in God the whole way and he certainly was gracious so now we're at our last um set of meetings um it's going to be at just a local church uh Gio uh would be the organizer of this meeting um it was just at a school so now we're here in Mumbai it's going to be in the in the north um brother Stanley was our transportation he's a pastor um in Mumbai in the city there uh which I come to find out it's a real expensive city to to live in uh could be a challenge there um he's uh just a was became the pastor of the church uh been working with it for a few years though and whe the Tim DOD was just with him the week before I got there so um brother Stanley's doing a work there in Mumbai and he arranged for someone to speak at his church and came with us to support uh going to this um this this church here with brother Gio and um this is a picture of the Gathering uh the little kids would be on the very front they were attentive serving the lord and this was a little song that they were singing when we come in [Music] so that was really the conclusion of the meetings there we um um if I could just I I was in in no um condition to minister but um if I didn't Minister um they weren't going to have us so um I just uh thought well we we don't want to lose the opportunity and I figured if there if I if I have to go under these terms so we we just come in and and uh we let them know what we believe and we did questions and answers and and we dropped another bomb off in that place um but we let them know and I'll say if you're going to do Mission work I think it's very important to tell them that God sent a prophet I mean you can tell them about the doctrines that we believe but you got to tell them the [Music] source I'm I I don't know how I'll to say it but you can go try to line line somebody out and get them all doctrinally right but if they're not connected to the Life Source that God provided for the age I I just only know I only know one way it works I'm sorry I I know there's a voice that God has given to me and it brings life it it gives me everything that I have need of and that's what you want to get people in contact with so I I don't want to iron out everybody's doctor if they get in contact with him he'll iron it out and it's God's provided way in the end time to get in contact with him not not an outpouring of gifts and and uh uh blessings and and and tongues and all that yeah that that that falls on All Flesh God blesses many people right or wrong but to get in contact with God there's a provided way in the end times so um this kind of concludes our uh trip um now we will uh start our journey home um we finished the meeting Sunday and then we flew out uh on Monday which turned into be we flew all the way back to Delhi and then uh our flight was at 11:55 p.m. Saturday night or what what day was it Tuesday night that's what happened on the whole trip we didn't know what day was what uh Christmas Eve is when we find finally uh got back home and um but I just wanted y'all to kind of see the magnitude of the trip I wasn't going to share anything and then uh uh on this scale but y'all were a part of it and so we wanted you to feel a part of it and so um you know that that's a little bit of the mission report while we were there in India and if if I could just maybe share um you know just uh briefly just what what would be on my heart or what we were wanting to accomplish there that's weird we can be done with the slides but as our our pastor you know was ministering and as I was thinking about our trip there and I just thought about looking to the Bible we got to be able to show people what we believe in the Bible and as our pastor was speaking about you know in nature there and and and feeding out of the the message thirst there's things that we do naturally if I could say it like this there's there's an instinct you get thirsty you don't have to you want water it it's a natural desire for you to go after water if you get thirsty and I just thought as he was ministering that there ought to be an instinct of the Holy Ghost in our lives there ought to be another something beyond the five senses but there gots to be an an instinct of the Holy Ghost and you know an instinct is an ability or a desire to perform a specific activity and I to tell you without the Holy Ghost you're only going to hold up so long and just as we read the quote uh uh Brother David read the quote uh this this morning if you don't feed the Holy Ghost it will die and I don't care what stage in the journey you are if you're Justified and you haven't received the Holy Ghost well what do you think it is that's justifying you it's the work of the Holy Ghost in your life if if you're living in a place of sanctification it's Theo it's the work of the Holy Ghost in your life so I don't care what phase you're in there's one thing and one thing alone and that's the the word only that's going to do it because you can't re rely on anything else but the word and so I was just thinking you got to have and we won't be long I'll try to uh uh I don't want to keep you I wanted to let off but uh my my pastor told me to preach too so we're just trying to be obedient so um there there ought to be a desire in your heart beyond the natural senses to fulfill the word of God because you're born again it's a new nature so there's an ability or a desire or a pull or a thirst there ought to be a thirst to read your Bible there ought to be a natural reaction as I was talking to Brother David you know there's a story about uh um you know the little uh snake that got cold it was on the road and it was picked up like well I I feel bad for this little thing I put it in Pocket got it War what happened after that snake got warm it was a snake to be with so you can't get hey why'd you bite me I took you up out of the cold I you were you were about to die and and and I saw you and I had compassion on you I picked you up and I put you in my pocket and I got you all warm and fuzzy and then you bit me and what would the snake say you knew I was a snake when you picked me up it's its nature or its Instinct and I I want to say that there ought to be something in the believer a holy ghost instinct that's that's that's instinctively carrying out the word of God and I was just thinking on this about you know uh uh the Instinct and what we believe you know and all the things that we'd say I would say you want to know what I believe look into the Bible now with that said and this is kind of by God's grace somehow tying in this mission report because you know you you can be looking in the Bible and not know what you're looking at especially I could you could fle over there I could say I'm looking in the Bible but I I can't I can't understand a thing in there because I'm not in position to know I would have to change my vantage point or something would have to happen to put me into a position where I could start to understand what was on the pages and and as I thought about this I was thinking there was once a a good man who was engaged to be married and and and and and he found a virtuous wife and he was was going to marry this this this young lady and and all of a sudden to his surprise he finds out she's with child now he was a just man and so he thought you know what I'm not going to put her away publicly but I will put her away privately but you see Joseph did not know what he was looking at right so here was a situation that happened and now he's looking at you can imagine how heartbroken he was and now the woman that he loved he's like what what do you mean but you see Joseph didn't realize he was actually looking at Isaiah 7:14 think about it now she's with child she's showing and Joseph's looking you've been untrue but what happened because I want to say this with without the prophecy Mary didn't make any sense and without Mary the prophecy didn't make any sense the the two had to become one but what happened to Joseph Joseph was confused he was heartbroken he was he didn't know what to do he's thinking on this thing and the Bible says in Matthew 1:20 said but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost you notice he was the angel of the Lord that eliminated the confusion where once Joseph didn't know what he was looking at but when the angel the Lord came it made sense of what the problem was so I can say you could be looking into the Bible and not know what you're looking at but if the angel of the Lord comes and I want to say this we'll try to end somewhere along these lines it took a visitation by the angel of the Lord Mary had plans M Mary uhh was a part of a community she was part of a family she was a Believer she was actually meditating on the very prophecy see Believers have special Insight how do you know that well it helps when the word makes itself flesh and tells you yeah when the word comes and tell you the waves were 12 foot high they were 12 foot high you wonder why he could tell stories like he was there well probably was might just be going back right into the scenario while he's talking about it yeah but see Joseph had all the confusion all the heartache he was meditating upon these things but when the angel the Lord came what seems so problematic what see which seems so chaotic when the angel of the Lord came fear not not Joseph Mary also think about all of her plans she she was looking forward to being married she was looking forward to taking care of Joseph and his kids say what are you talking about once again sorry I believe believe you know brother Jo Joseph already had kids so you know we can talk about that later but she had dreams she had a testimony but you know what happened to Mary she had a visitation by the angel of the Lord and everything she thought maybe she was going to carry out everything she thought she was going to do what made the difference I'm going try to end along these L but what made the difference a visitation by the angel of the Lord where he comes and says and the angel Luke 1:30 and the angel said un her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive and in thy womb bring forth the son and shalt call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of David his father and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end now I'm telling you this is could you imagine the message that she's receiving from this Angel you've also received a message from the angel then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said to her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee you want to know how you're going to manifest the message of the hour same way the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God you too are called to be pregnated with the word of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall has also conceived in a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron well I tell you she's probably very thankful for that word because she knows she could go check it out if he said it I bet she was I bet she was I can't wait to get there but it would be exactly how the angel said it for with God nothing shall be in impossible and Mary said let me think about it Mary said let me pray about it Mary said this is really strange I don't know let me talk to Joseph no Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word according to what word the word word of the Angel of the Lord it ain't my word I didn't wake up one day and decide I was going to be a message believer I didn't wake up one day and think that I would say this but one thing I can say Lord let it be according to Thy word and the and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it according to Thy word and the angel departed from her look Mary's plans change but God's plans never change and if I could try to just end here the Bible is God's plan the Book of Revelation it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and his Future Works through the church ages you can meditate on it you can look at it but until you have a visitation by the angel of the Lord you don't know what you're looking at I am not talking theology yes sir I am not talking message culture yes sir I'm not talking about Camp experiences I'm talking about a visitation by the angel it took a visitation for Mary to conceive Abraham was given the promise and it took a visitation by the angel for Sarah to conceive you see God's pattern and if the bride is going to birth the full word into manifestation it took a visitation what do you think Malachi 45 was it was a visitation that God in the end times said I want to have a bride without spot or wrinkle but I must come [Applause] down we're all looking in the Bible wondering what it means yeah and it took a visitation God coming down and veiling himself in a man what was he doing he was take you were way over here looking into the Bible but he took you now and he changes your Vantage Point and brings you in to where now the book that you once couldn't understand he starts to tell you you want to know what I believe look into the Bible but I say we have interesting problem amongst us culturally many people believe the message culturally believe the message but if the Bible is not alive and open to you something's wrong if I could say it this way you cannot have the message without the Bible and I say what you want to say and you can't understand the Bible without the message and so we sit over here on one side God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet brother brandom said brother brandom said brother BR said but we can't even take the very thing the message was founded on and pick it up and Minister life to somebody with it something's wrong culturally we say we believe the message we we got to do more than teach our kids we got to get them in an atmosphere to be born again say Hy you even know what the message is well you can start you you have to start laying it in there that we didn't even understand what the Bible meant we thought it meant this we thought it meant that it had become hybrid and if the Bible and all these things we believe are laying in there you can't you can't come on this side and say brother brandom said brother random said brother random said and this not be alive to you you should be able to go out there which you know what a lot of us need we need our crutch to be knocked out from underneath us and I need a hand I say look into the Bible come here brother show me what you believe right here amen without your cell phone without your message search engine take the Bible show me water baptism show me Serpent seed show me the godhead amen show me the church ages show me predestination show me no eternal hell show me the ABCs Hallelujah yes but we built up some religion brother brandham said brother brandom said brother brandom said well you know what brother brandom said he said read your Bible and pray I I I want to be more spiritual what should I do get out your pen here comes a big answer from the prophet what can I do to be more spiritual brother read your Bible and pray amen but we we got a big crutch called the message brother Brandon said brother brandom said and I dressed right and I dressed this but when it comes to the Bible see that's the problem somebody's sick somebody needs to be saved somebody needs to be get the Holy Ghost and what they want you to do is make this live they don't know anything about the other they don't maybe know God's provided way in the end time was to send a prophet but that that end time prophet made this alive to you so you can take the very thing that's alive can you impart eternal life Jesus said whoever send you remit or remitted and whosoever sends you retain or retain you can take the Living Word and you can start to minister life to somebody and then they start to get thirsty and they start to want what you have you say oh I got so much for you but I didn't get it on my own it's according to Divine scripture that God would send a prophet or if I could say it this way that there would be a visitation by the angel if few musicians would come the only way I can go to India and have anything to offer is because God sent a prophet I some somebody said this uh you know I don't mind saying it you know was a I don't mind saying it you know Minister had left the message and he thought he'd be somebody come to find out without the message he didn't have any following he ran into another M Minister and he said you know brother I doubt he called him brother but this is the guy who left the message he goes without the message you wouldn't have anything to preach and he looked back at him and said apparently you didn't either I'm sorry I got nothing without the message I'm not going to India to straighten people out on their water baptism I'm going to India where if I can show them in the word that the word is infallible I I'll just read this quote brother Rena said uhow in the last age we have come back to the Capstone Revelation the most important revelation of the godhead in the whole Bible that is Jesus Is God he and the father are one there is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he is the god of the amen he never changes what he does never changes he says it and it stands fast he does it and it's done forever well I could run around the church right now what it's done is is done forever none can take from that what he says or add to it so let it be amen so let it be are you glad that you serve that kind of God you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time he is the amen of God and won't change we can sing I speak the name of Jesus don't aren't you glad we serve that kind of God you want to know what we believe I believe the [Music] Bible because it was open to me why what do you mean brother Matthew well just as Joseph needed a visitation by the angel of the Lord to understand his life [Music] just as Mary needed a visitation by the angel of Lord to understand her predestination the bride is no different God knew you would be here but he had a pattern he said I must visit lady OA CU I'm going to bring forth my bride so what is it Church we've had a visitation God has come down in lady OA that you can birth forth the full word and the manifestation it's God's provided way what are you talking about brother Matthew if you want to go in a Rapture if you want to go in a body change if you want to escape the oncoming judgment look at the pattern it's that simple you start to walk people through the Bible you turn to Matthew 24 you start to that's what we walk these ministers through showing them surely Elias must come but he's come already he said there won't be one pass away till every stone is knocked out it was already fulfilled and you can walk him through the the story of the end time showing where we're at but what does all the buildup do what what does all the climax do what does iron all the doctrine do if you don't show them plainly God's provided way in the end [Music] time I'll say it in [Music] closing brother Josh Bennett was preaching one time and somebody come up to say brother Josh He said you y y'all are always you know you're always saying brother Brandon brother Brandon brother brand why don't you just you know all that's good but why don't you leave brother brandom out of it he he said you know I listened to the guy and was thinking about what he said he said then it struck him he said you know what tell me this if you can tell the story about the ark and leave no out of it he said if you can tell the story about the children of Israel going in Exodus and leaving Moses out of it if you can tell the story about the first coming to the Lord and leave John the Baptist out of it said but if you're going to tell the story about the change of my body if you're going to tell the story about me going in a Rapture if you're going to tell me about the story of the greatest climatic in in history for human kind if you're going to put Noah in the story if you're going to put Moses in the story if you're going to put John the Baptist in the story then go ahead and put William brandom in the story that you ain't going in a Rapture you ain't going in a body change without it that's my message to India that's my message to the whole world because it ain't my message it was given to me by Malachi 45 let's [Music] stand let's just sing the song as our pastor comes I Hallelujah I just want to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and every mind cuz I know there is peace with in your presence I speak Jesus I just want to speak the name of Jesus till every dark starts to break declaring there is hope and there is freom high [Music] Jesus your name is power your name is healing oh your name is [Music] break every stold the sh shout Jesus from the [Music] mountains shout Jesus from the mountain oh and Jesus in your street oh Jesus in Darkness over every enemy well Jesus for my family when I speak the Holy Name of Jesus one more time shout Jesus from the mountain shout Jesus from the mountain and Jesus from Street every enemy Jesus for my family I speak the holy [Music] nameus your name is power your name is your name [Music] [Applause] is [Music] every let's sing that little chorus again cuz your name is found [Music] your name is your [Music] name bre every sh hallelujah amen do you enjoy that tonight amen you know the prophet of God said there'd be another book of Acts right written after this word what did he return us to he returned us back to the word of God that we could believe every line every statue every part of it we he said take it just the way it is he didn't need explaining it needed believing he wrote it and he spoke it just the way he wanted to write it and just the way he wanted to speak it and if he said it it's life it's truth and it'll carry out in do what he said it would do and it's that simple and and if if there's everything that you noticed about our messenger he took the word of God if I could use that expression at face value this is what he said and and you I can't add anything to that that's just exactly where my heart's desire is just like this morning he saw everything is laying right there in the word of God but it was sealed up and all of a sudden it's been opened up to us the River of Life the tree of life that you you can go to that and pick any promise of that book every promise and take it for yourself and say This Promise is mine I can make this promise live because God stands in his word so God bless you I I I just thought that was wonderful and and in the part of Matthew's trip I don't want you to miss is he wasn't preaching the message people you understand wasn't like people call missionary trips I'm going to go here preach at this brother's church and this brother's church and this brother's church and and go there no this was going to where no man has gone before if I could say it that way I like it and what did the gospel do it had an effect they saw it and they said amen and I like that scripture said like the Thessalonians these were more diligent than most they sought out and searched the scripture to find out if these things are true and if they search the scriptures you know what you're going to find you're going to find Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 has been manifested in the flesh in our day and it's true and Paul spoke it this way I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation and God's given all of us something great to believe don't be ashamed of it we're not intellect we don't show Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of the wisdom of men but I came to you with the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit let's keep the gospel the gospel let's accept who we are let's let our light shine sisters you be proud of your long hair you be proud of your addresses you be proud of your Holiness men be let your conversation be righteous let your actions be pure and so let your light shine amongst men that your good works might glorify your father which is in heaven that men might inquire of you what is the hope that you have what is the reason for your peace and you can give them an answer because you've meant something that's changed you God bless you I just just hardly anything to add I'm not much of a singer we'll say a prayer Billy can come and close with some songs of worship our gracious father we thank you for the wonderful insight into the work that you did and father the sacrifice that it took to go and and father there in that country of a billion people people probably not much bigger than the like the country it's it's just so crowded and but that means there's so many Souls there and you're not a respector of persons all men were created by your word and your will father and may these Souls that were baptized may they increase in the wisdom and knowledge father may you give them Revelation May they seek the scripture May their hearts hunger and thirst after righteousness father and may they come to the revelation of this hour that your word is true that they might see and you give them eyes have that they could see the Fulfillment of the promise of our age doing just exactly what you said you had promis to do how many times I heard the messenger of this age stand in the pulpit and said God is doing doing exactly what he promised to do in this age and made it visible before us father I pray that you open their eyes that it's become so visible and real to them that they can share it with conviction they can share it with no alternative motive and objective father it was freely given to them Father may they freely give in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless billly would you lead us on some closing worship amen be on fire for God Amen tell somebody seow the seed of God and you'll reap a whirlwind cast your bread upon the Water it will not return void all these things
