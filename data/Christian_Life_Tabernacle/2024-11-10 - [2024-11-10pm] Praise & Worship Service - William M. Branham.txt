Description:
Praise & Worship 
November 10, 2024
2024 CLT Dedication Meetings
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

and uh I consider my my voice the weakest of the three but uh you know it just this sort of is a window into um how I've written a lot of songs um that we've sung and it's usually in the trenches just plunking away at my guitar you know in in some trial or just or something that I've just seen in the message and uh then I would go over to like a lot of of times I lived away and we would go over and and get together with Linda and Joanne and start singing the song and all of a sudden it just became such a such a more beautiful song and before I didn't have the elone I didn't have the tenor and um just the instruments and um I just thought you know this is this is really how I did write a lot of the songs so um through the mistakes and what all but um you know I got thinking too how that uh when you're at home and you're in your own home church and a lot of times people don't know what you're going through and you're you know you're just really just in the trenches once again and yet I found when I come here and come to places that God brings all his children together from different places and all of a sudden it's like oh there's my elto and there's my tenor and you know you hear the the testimonies and the other you know problems and things that uh people are going through and your brothers and sisters and and all of a sudden you've got the bride you know Onward Christian Soldiers just marching together and so I just want to thank you for all the the um Fellowship that that we've had and the few one-on ones that we could share I hope I can do this [Music] this world is getting [Music] old my desire to stay here has grown cold and the sign I see are telling me that I'm not welcome anymore I'm going to reach out to the Unseen and let deep water cover me I'm leaving

brother Ben called you I said brother Ben knows I don't sing maybe they want me to sing that would bring an end to the singing for sure I'll tell you this weekend uh I think this is one of the best meetings we've ever had you know and I I think it's was what it was because there was Freedom amen and there's nothing more wonderful than to see God's children free and there's there's so much bondage in the land and so much fear and you know everybody trying to think that they have to get their Doctrine right and they have to get their teachings right and they have to understand this and understand that and and then you think of just how simple it was the prophet said if you have eternal life you always had eternal life and he said if you weren't with him there in the beginning you won't be there and you it just takes us out of the picture and I I I like being taken out of the picture you know uh I you know when I I I sit up here and and I I see the Lord move and everything and I I can hardly believe that this is me you know because I was always was really Bound by complexes and uh um you know just fear of being in front of people and being around people and in fact I've always had a little saying in my heart there won't be any people in heaven because we're going to have to be so different you know what I mean and and so uh what was so wonderful to me was to see so many people from so many different places and so many different backgrounds coming together and joining in love around God's word and and when it's all said and done it it's Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will not pass away and and uh see people have hope and know that yesterday doesn't hold you yesterday is not your chain that you can leave those things which are behind behind and press for a higher calling and your history sometimes is very difficult to look at my history is very difficult to look at and if I look back I just have to remember one thing that there's a blood that has been shed for me that came down and washed my history away and I don't can't relive today but I can try to live tomorrow the best I can and if if my tomorrow isn't as good as I want it to be I'll put it under the blood and move on to the next day and I'll continually putting it under the blood and one day I'll meet him there because that's God's provided place place of worship is under the shed blood and so I I'm I'm grateful for this weekend brother Tom brother Mike we're just thankful for the word and the Liberty that you felt to preach your heart to us and remind us once again that we serve a God not just a God but the one and only true living Goden amen and he is God and that's just the way it is and so I'm going to sing a song oh you know better than that how long how long have you know me I have property to sell too you know what I mean no you're going to help me sing a song Amen and Matthew's Comm this is a song Matthew's than with the choir and you know I don't know they even know the name of the song I just know that he's God and that's just the way it is he's the only God right is that what we heard we heard a God that's present tense we heard a God that's got unspeakable and unlimited power and that's God and he's not a God that was created by human human hands he's not a God that's dependent on Mortal man he's not a God that's in need of anything that's his plan and that's just the way it is and when we go out from this place just remember that's the God we serve yes not by our choice but by his choice you didn't choose me but I have chosen you and if he chose you he is obligated to you that's right if he called you he's obligated to keep you amen and if he saved you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand so as we go let's remember that we serve God the one and only true Living God and that's just the way it [Music] is on anyal man you are not a God in need of anything we can get by your plan that's just the way it is [Music] you're the only God who [Applause] [Music] power only the only God who name graceful neor only God who's worthy of anything we can G you are God just the way oh any you God alone but Before Time began you are on your throne You Are God Alone and right now in the good times and you are on your throne You Are God [Applause] Alone your only God who [Music] power can only only God name praise for you're the only God who wory of everything we can give you are God that's just the way oh You Are God Alone come again you are on your throne and you are God and right [Music] now you are on your throne You Are God Alone you're unchangeable unshakeable [Music] unstable that's what you are you're unchangeable unshakeable unstable that's what you are and You Are God Alone time begin you are on your throne You Are God Alone right [Music] now you are you are God our gracious father we heard this weekend that you are God the creator of Heaven and Earth The Shepherd of our souls you were our beginning and you will be our end we were the thoughts that were with you before there ever was a star you slipped a little wedding band of predestination on us and you declared that we would be your elect lady and we came from all walks of life we found ourselves in all kinds of treacherous situations we had wandered far from you and we were lost in a foreign [Music] land but you came to seek [Music] us you sought us out you spoke your word and your word was what we were and when you spoke there was something that came to life in us and we were resurrected and we traveled through our thoughts and through our minds trying to find you and one time and one day and one place each of us we came fac face to face with [Music] you and you welcomed us home you welcomed us into your [Music] kingdom and many enemies have risen up against us and many voices have spoken to us but father we're here this evening to declare unto you that we have returned back to your voice we have returned back to your ways and we have returned back to putting our trust in you for you are the only God and that's the way it is and we're so thankful father as our friends return home may all the things that they spoke under inspiration take form in their lives [Music] father I ask that you be with lesie and I as we travel father it's been on my heart for years to have this meeting in Zambia [Music] and I don't know what lies ahead father but I know that you per prepareth the path before me and you are a lamp under my feet and If I Could Just Surrender [Music] myself that they might know the God that was preached this weekend here is the creator of Heaven and Earth that they might find Hope and joy and that every bondage might be broken by the power of the Resurrection we ask that you would help us father bring [Music] you and we ask that you go with us father you've raised up great men in this church to carry the flame and I'm so grateful may we ever be steadfast to stay with your word though many things pull may we know one thing my sheep hear my voice and another they will not follow bless us now we pray in Jesus precious name amen and amen I just like to share some something it's a little funny but they made a poster for the meetings I I didn't know they were going to do that so they made a big poster up there somehow they went in the archive and dug up a picture from about 25 years ago are they going to be shocked you know I'm all shaved you know what I mean and I'm standing there nice and young I'm skinny and they're going to get a fat old balded beard man show up but aren't you glad it's not the flesh that counts amen it's not the God on the outside it's the God on the inside amen so uh I I just thought that was strange well then they found out that I was getting in Tuesday so they said well man if he's coming in Tuesday let's have him preach Wednesday night so I can preach Wednesday night and then they probably will sneak in a Thursday but anyway I'm supposed to preach Wednesday night Friday night Saturday morning Saturday night Sunday morning and Sunday night now have any of you ever witnessed me preaching that many services in a [Music] row but if you want to get up at 2 o00 in the morning you can stream it I think but anyway they've been an expectation and remember when I go you go and when I go I'm taking you with me in my heart and so all I can say is I'm I Love The Gospel that the Lord Jesus has given us how can I say that I love his love I can't believe he picked me but I'm so happy he did so love one another's little children love one another he who saith he loves God and hates his brother is a liar forgive one [Music] another be kind one to another and I believe we'll see a fruit that you can't imagine I believe the power of God's just fixing to strike the church if we stay in step we will see things that we've only thought were impossible God bless you go in peace thank you for your love thank you for your support take Jesus with you God bless you go in [Music] peace if you're walking through the V and no Shadows all around not fear he will guide you he will keep you safe and call his promise to never leave you don't forsake you and his word is true God is good all the time he put a song ofer In This Heart of Mind God is good all the time oh through the dark has night in my side God is good God is good
