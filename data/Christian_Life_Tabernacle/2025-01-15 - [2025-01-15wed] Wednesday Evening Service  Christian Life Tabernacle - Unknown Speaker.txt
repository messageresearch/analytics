the world and you know this ought to be a a a place that you come and it should be a Haven of Rest and uh Satan would want to change that you know you want somebody to sit in your spot or park in your place or he wants you to feel uncomfortable or you find out you didn't wear the right matching outfit and or somebody's collar is up and the only thing you can think about the whole service is if you should go flip their collar down you know it's funny how little things like that can can disrupt but what we want to do let's go up a little step higher come up higher John let's let's get into the Eternal realm now let's get past the veil and the work week and know that right now is a predestinated moment in time where the great creator of heavens and earth designed that he would come by our way and this would be an opportunity that he would speak to you and that whatever cares whatever burdens you could lay it down at his feet and you could be honest with him you know sometimes you feel like you got nobody to talk to and nobody could understand you but there's one amen there's one that knows why don't we just go before him Lord Jesus so many times Lord we look to the things of the world we we run to the medicine cabinet we go to Google Lord that's the age that we live in where devices and Technology dominate our thinking and our attention Lord we want to be reminded that you're the solution for everything Lord whatever the need is naturally or spiritually Lord you are the answer [Music] there's a thirst inside of us Lord that's thirsting and Lord as you've been showing us through our pastor and the message of the hour as your Prophet once said you want to reveal this this great secret mystery Revelation to us but we let so many things take it out of us we let our jobs and our family and the cares of this life life Lord we want to tell you we're sorry for that tonight and just ask Lord that you'd forgive us Lord where we we haven't been diligent like we we should and we want to take the message that you've been giving to us Lord we want to be successful Christians and we know lord it's not something that we do but it's something that you do in us we want to yield to that Lord and say am men to the word and Lord there's a lot of hurting hearts and there's a lot of needs here we need you Lord just to come and provide the comfort and the healing that we so need Lord and we know that you use the body to bring those things Lord all of us joined together is your ministry and so may we just look out on the needs of one another and be obedient servants tonight and get behind the word Lord and just look forward for you to have your perfect will and way in the service we commit this time to you and ask these blessings in your name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles let's just turn in uh the book of Psalms at 42 um I just remember Brother David in prayer um his eye is is is causing him some problem that I think we got a good report that the uh the blood that was in his eye wasn't in the retina or it's not separating so it is something that can clear up but but we want to remember his um um he wanted us to listen to about another 20 minutes out of the message of thirst and as we're reading out of Psalms 42 this would be um the text that brother Brandon would take for this sermon so let's just read that in Psalms 42 it says as the heart panteth after the water Brook so panteth my soul after thee oh God my soul thirst for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God Amen you may have your seats uh so we just we're going to be playing um a just a 20 minute portion as our pastor has uh desired and we uh Sunday morning we left off at paragraph 44 right at the end but we'll just go ahead and for context uh play paragraph 44 and end at 88 at the end of 88 and there's a lot of nuggets in there and so uh we'll just make a few comments at the end and uh remember that um our Pastor said that he's not leaving the thought of a path forward right so remember this this is this is the path forward and many things that he spoke about about unity and so um I was reminded of he read that uh quote later on in the message it says if you if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll die so let's just remember some of these principles as we'll continue um to listen in in this sermon and just see what God has for us amen God bless you as we continue to listen see it's something natural it's not an unnatural thing to thirst for God it's a natural thing it's just something that you should do God has made you up like that and it's no superum it's just actually a common human being it ain't just special for some people they say well I've seen some people live such a a Victorious Life that they're constantly on the housetop they're praising God wish I could feel that way well the reason you're feeling that way it's a thirst in you and uh that's just a natural thing is for every person to thirst for God now we'll take some of the natural thirst is first let's take for instance thirsting for water as David said here U thirsting for of the water thirsting for water the body is in need of water and if you don't Supply that thirst you'll perish you'll dehydrate and you the you won't live if you can't get water to that thirst to quench that thirst of the Natural Body you will soon perish you won't live long you can live longer without food than you can without water because you can fast for 40 days Jesus did I suppose without without food but you couldn't do that long without water you would just simply dry up and die you must have water and if and The Thirst that comes on you well it's to show that the body is in need of something to keep it alive the body's got to have the water in order to stay alive you're 80 something per uh water and petroleum anyhow and you've got to take these sources in to keep you alive as I've said if you neglect it you'll perish uh The Thirst also is an alarm it's an alarm clock that thirsting the soul set off alarm clock a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that death has lurking nigh that if you don't get water pretty soon you've got to die and it gets louder and louder until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die because it's alarm clock like David described it you're in the Psalms as a heart paintthe so so paintthe oh God as the heart paintthe water book I've often thought as reading of this of David David was a Woodsman a hunter and he hunted deer of course and many we in this day hunt them the heart is a deer and we find if you ever seen the dogs that wild dogs to grab a deer and usually they got like the coyote of fang and he can grab the deer right above the bir the ear here and swing his weight he cuts the throat of the deer and the deer doesn't have a chance then but sometimes the the the dog like in Africa there the Wild dog will grab the deer right in the flanks if he misses the throat he'll grab the second time at the flanks and if the deer is strong enough and quick enough he can shake the dog off the deer's much faster the dog stalks him when he's not looking and when he's up wind from him and and he uh he don't know the the dog is near and then when the Wild dog grabs him if he's real quick he can throw it off and but when the dog comes out of the flank he's got a whole mouthful of the deer's flesh or when he grabs at his neck sometime he'll cut close to the Jugger vein and miss it and the deer shaking will pull a whole chunk of meat out of the deer's throat then the blood begins to run and then the dog will come right on the trail of that blood after the deer and as the life of the deer begins to dwindle as the blood is which is the life stream to the body as that begins to dwindle down the deer gets weaker and the dog D or the wolf is right behind the deer now if that deer can't find water now water has something in it that when the deer drinks the water it stops the bleeding but if he don't get water to cool him off then the the blood keeps flowing out faster because he's running keeping his heart pumping but if he can ever get to water the deer will live now there's a great lesson there see and David's saying here as the heart paintthe water broke my soul old pth for thee oh God now that deer knows unless he finds water he's gone he just can't live I've tracked him many times after being wounded when he hits a stream of water he'll cross in and get a drink go up over the hill come back down cross get a drink of water and go up you'll never catch up with him as long as he'll follow that stream but once when he leaves the stream if he can't find another water Brook somewhere you'll catch him right away and now the deer knows that so he'll stay right with the water where he can get to it right quick now could you imagine a deer with his nose up he's been caught out somewhere where there's no water and he says as the heart uh thirst or pain is the thirst after the water Brooks my soul thirst after the oh God unless I can find you Lord I'll perish that's right I I I can't go unless I find you and when a man or a woman boy or girl gets that kind of a thirst for God he's going to find something see but when we come at it just kind of halfway well I'll kneel down and see what the Lord does see you're not really thirsting yet it's got to be a thirst between death and life and then something takes place the deer also here he's uh we find uh and he is also has another sense of smell that sets off alarm in him when his enemy is near he's possessed this little creature with a a sense to protecting C and he's uh he's got a little alarm in him a little something that he he tickles his nose when the enem is near you can get in the Wind of the enemy and he knows that you're there and he's gone sometimes a half a mile away he can smell you and get away or the wolf or any danger he's able to sense it because that he's made up that way he's a deer by nature and that sense in him is just one of the god giving senses to him to live by and I know I thought comparing the deer with a man that's thirsting for God before the enemy gets there there's something about a child of God that when you once are born into the spirit of God receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's something about the person that can sense the enemy you can take a man when he's taking the scripture and reading the scripture and trying to inject something to that scripture that's contrary to the scripture a man that's filled with the Holy Ghost can sense that right quick there's something out of the way when he gets into a place and and uh that little certain sense in there that uh it's done to protect your life you you mustn't uh you must never go for anything un L it's exactly the word of God you must stay right exactly with that word and now and we are uh uh secured with that sense as long as we're in the Holy Spirit you can go to read and like for instance somebody say now go to read Mark 16 and say and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues or take up serpents or drink daily things it would not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover now then you find a person get up there and say now that was for the apostolic age that now right quick if you have received the Holy Spirit you've been endowed with that sense that sets it off there's something wrong there that's right see if try to explain it way that's far another day that really you don't need those things today but Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe there's a little something sets off in you a little buzzer and knowing that that's wrong and that's the way of death because Jesus said if we add one word to this or take one word from it our parts taken out of the Book of Life not one scripture we must take it just the way it's written and God watches over his word to perform it and we know that's it's got to be just right so therefore no matter what a church would say what anyone else would say if you're born of the spirit of God you become part of the Bible God told Ezekiel he the prophet he said take the scroll and eat it then the prophet and the scroll became part of each other and that's the believer when he receives the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible and the spirit of God is the word of God my words are Spirit In the Beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us Hebrews 138 is the same yesterday today and forever and when you are a part of that word oh then let something come up contrary to that word because the little buzzer sets off right quick see it's the warn you that death is in the road we should never do that there is the all these thirst are just natural they are natural for the Christian they are natural for the human being there is also a thirst for Success so many people today how we school for this thirst we just noticed the start of the University up and we go down there and people spend thousands of dollars to send her children to the school and and to universities and colleges and so forth to get an education to be successful they call it in life but now I have nothing against that that's all right but to me you could get all the schooling in the world and still you haven't found the right success that's right because that will just temporarily make uh things a little easier for you here and there's uh but when you die you leave all that behind you and this entire economy that we have I was saying the other day at Phoenix the stand quoting again that all this modern civilization the whole educational program the whole scientific program is all contrary to God's word and his will civilization is absolutely there'll never be civilization in the world that is to come like this one this is the perverted civilization God had his first civilization upon the earth when he spoke his words and they come up every seed of its kind and in that Civilization there was no death sickness sorrow and now we take the things that is in the scientific world that was put here to hold it together and pervert it into something and that brings death that's right like the atomic bomb I don't know the fers of these things but I might say this wrong it take uranium to split a a molecule and a molecule breaks an atom or what does it do that it just malates almost just destroys everything that we do we take medicine put this formuler with this formuler to cure this and put it into us and what do we do we tear down something else now I guess you read La read last month's reader digest that it said that in this age that we're living in now that young men and women women me reach middle age between 20 and 25 years old think of that little girls and menopause and 20 22 23 years old middle AG you see what's done it it's been this hybrid food and stuff we're eating see it's the stuff the food and the the life that we're living scientists has brought it to us and in doing so they're killing you as in Africa we're I see them boys that never had a dose of medicine in their life they eat uh meat that had maggots in it they drank out of a pool that it looked like would kill an ox and I was shooting a Target at 200 yards and I couldn't see it with a pair of 750 binoc and a man my age is stand there tell me where I was hitting with his naked eye now if all this modern culture has done something I feel if I had his eyes in his stomach I'd be a pretty good man yeah but there you are see that's what Science Education civilization we're destroyed by it we destroy ourselves it started in the Garden of Eden and runs on for today but thirsting for Success man we thirst for Fellowship we go we want Fellowship it's like a young man and a young woman now it's not unnecessary or not I mean unnatural for a young man and a young woman to to love love one another it is a thirst for love it's her age and they they love one another and it's not unnatural that's it's a natural thing for him to do that now we find many things in the life that we live in the natural body that we thirst far it's just something sets in us we want to do it we absolutely feel that it's necessary and it is necessary that we do it we find many uh women u in these days uh uh thirst for View now there isn't a woman it's a natural thing for a woman to thirst to be pretty that's that's her god-given Instinct in her beauty that God give her for her mate and now we find out that women want to be that way why is it it's just because it's something God gave her it's not wrong for women to be pretty they should be and you know they are the only creature that that the female is prettier than the male it's in the human race every other animal take the the cow to the bull the do deer to the buff the hen to the rooster the motherb bird to the father bird always you find the male is big and pretty but on the human race show there where the perversion come it turns around and it's the women so it's it's pretty and they lust to be pretty not like some of these worried creatures we see on the street of this day no no not that kind of pretty that's a harvest looking side I ever seen in my life yes sir that is a perversion that's perverting the true thirst now the truth thirst that a woman should have would be to Adorn themselves in modest apparel and to have a Christlike Spirit 1 Timothy 2:9 now that's a way the woman should thirst to be now if you want to be pretty that's the way what makes you pretty see is a Christlike spirit andorn and modest apparal oh my some of these people today out on the streets you can't tell a man from the woman and it's a it's the most horrible looking thing it you I it's it's I I never seen anything like it like human beings it's beyond human eyes painted way up like that and you know them funny looking lizard eyes and all them funny looking clothes and well I don't even also out of farm that don't even look like a human being and some of them boys out here their hair combed down their sisters roarers in front here you know why it's a complete perversion that's right it's a it's a it's Satan and Satan is a perverter when God made everything in the Garden of Eden it was lovely then Satan come in and perverted Satan cannot create nothing there's only one Creator that's God but Satan perverts the original creation right and now he's got into this I want to speak tonight about perverting the the original creation of thirst now a woman as I said before wants to be pretty there's something in her that she's feminist and she wants to be that way but the way they are on the street today hair cut like a man wearing man's clothes and then man turn around wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing your food's perverted your life's perverted your thirst perverted your desires perverted it's a day of perversion speaking here not long go on Satan's Eden God took 6,000 years and made a perfect Eden Satan come over and sprayed them seeds and deformed him now he's got 6,000 years and he's got his own scientific Eden right back again on a perversion of the right and this is the age of high breeding High breeding they've even got the the church is to dat of their High bread that's right they get in here they just go to a church it's a lodge instead of a church a church is a place where people come together and worship God in spirit and in truth and today it's a lodge we go there and have a little kind to shake hands and fellowship with some black coffee in the back of the building and go home till next week we've done our religious Duty now it's a perverted age and Satan is perverting these thirst that God putting you to thirst Satan is perverting them now if you want to know the right perversion if you the women want to be pretty take first Timothy 2:9 that's how they adorning themselves in modest spirit with AO with a Christlike Spirit meet subject to their husbands and so forth that's the way that you should be adorned your life you live he perverts the true nature of God and the true thirst of God of the body and soul by lust for sin sin a perversion now we find out a person today the way they've took that perversion thirst for God The Thirst for to be pretty and all these thirst for for water they turn that into to satisfying that with drinking The Thirst for joy everybody wants to have joy thirst for Fellowship all these great thirst that God put into us that we might thirst after him God Made You to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of a thirst with some other kind of a perversion of the correct thirst see inter natural see that's in the spiritual we think as long as we draw church that's that's satis that's all we have to do well that is absolutely wrong no God wants you to thirst for him amen as the heart pain for the water Brook my soul thirst after thee Oh God see see amen praise the Lord what a wonderful word amen amen maybe by the help of God we'll just make a few comments on that um but I I like that just that last um um portion there um he says uh God wants you to thirst for him as the heart panth after the water Brook and right before that he says see how it's in the spiritual I'm backing up a little bit just that God Made You to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of thirst now I these are the words of God and many times I think there's a great danger if I could say it like this where um I I mean we just don't know how blessed we are we we have the voice of God and to have a revelation of that you have what everybody needs and what's unfortunate though it becomes common to us because we we pack it around in our pocket we we got it on devices and we allow the word of God to become so common in such a way where we don't take heed and then we kind of get to a place of complacency where he's no longer talking about us he's kind of talking about the world he's kind of talking about the denominations he's kind of talking about Pentecostalism because we've already arrived you know and and we we we thirst but we got the message no he's talking to me he's telling me as a Son of God because those that I love I rebuke and I chase and and he's trying to tell you my son I've created you to thirst but now watch he says but that thirst he said God Made You to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of thirst so he's telling me his son son if you're not careful right there's going to be the enemy is going to come in and and this flesh man is going to try to satisfy that thirst for God with things of the world with some other kind of perversion of some of the correct thirst see how it's in the natural so he laid it out there in the natural see how it's in the spiritual we think as long as we join church that settles it spiritual we think as long as we have an experience that settles it but remember he said I I if you don't Milk The Cow I thought that would be a if a great title for a sermon if you don't Milk The Cow what happens if you don't Milk The Cow it dries up right what happens if you don't drink water you die what happens if you don't give the Holy Ghost the word you die so we find out that that thirst in you is for what the word which is God that's what's going to sustain that's what's going to keep you and and the the beautiful thing about it is oh how the word ties together the the religious world was was in a Cess pool of denomination in broken sisters and that can't quench The Thirst but now what do we have we we have a fountain open in the House of David oh it's just flowing and flowing that you can come drink freely so we'll just try to um make a few comments we won't be long uh just to um Fellowship on these things but uh so let's just go back and we'll just kind of walk through um the some of the the quotes here in 44 if they'll go ahead and bring that up as we'll just read that um and and just walk through some of these things together and just uh enjoy the word of God Amen so in 44 um he says see it's something natural it's not a an natural thing to thirst for God it's a natural thing it's just something that you should do God has made you up like that and it's no no superhuman it's just actually a common human being it's just it ain't just uh uh just special for some people they say well I I've I've seen some people live such Victorious lives that they're constantly on the housetop they're praising God wish I could feel that way well the reason you are feeling that way it's The Thirst in you right and it's just a natural thing it's for every person to thirst for God so when you when you see somebody maybe they're living in Victory and you see somebody that's praising God you you see these things happening and you want that that is a natural thing for you to want that because God put that in you and what is it it's a thirst for him you know you you he said thirst is an natural thing thirst for success is a natural thing so when you when you see uh the world and and Lady OA and and and you see them all uh uh winning their trophies and and becoming successful and and getting their championships and they they they won the championship I they they're Victorious you know there's there's a natural uh way of thirsting for Success thirsting uh for accomplishment thirsting uh uh to be successful wanting uh if you're not careful we we see uh people successful in life and we start to measure things out by what as our pastor was laying out there we start to measure things by what lady osia calls successful and if you start to see that there's a thirst in you that's natural God Made You to thirst but Satan comes along and he perverts that thirst for God for the things of the world and one thing that I found out there's nothing in this world that can ever satisfy the thirst for God that's right I tell you young people if if if you if you're growing up under a a home where your parents are applying the token and and it seems like there's things out there in the world that you want to try and and you want to do I want to tell you it's death it it might uh tickle the senses it might give you a rush it might give you an adrenaline rush but I want to tell you where it's leading you to is death because when lust is conceived it bringeth forth death you know that's that's the problem with with drug addicts and things like that they get a taste for it or if I can and or they get a thirst for it and it's this invigorating feeling they they feel all they feel good and and maybe the cares of this world and things oh they're not thinking about them anymore and and it gives them a temporary satisfaction action and then what does it do it creates a thirst for it and then they start thirsting for it and then they need more of it and the amount that satisfied them last time is not enough so they need more and more and more what it's just a perversion it in one it's a it's a natural thirst that's been perverted and what does de the devil want to do he wants to give you a substitute I I I'll just share this I I I I think it's quite profound um um it's just something that I noticed but I I noticed a lot of times when we go to youth camps and and and and we go places where we're having a a a meeting for the young people it's like whenever a young person finally has a wonderful experience in the Lord for some reason Mr Wright is right there I mean it just somehow magically I finally got experience with God I got the Holy Ghost and here's my husband it's a distraction he wants to be your husband he wants to lead you he wants to guide you he wants you to be excited about him but Satan wants to offer you an alternative and thankfully you know I I was a little bit older and a little bit wiser sure enough guess what happened when my wife got uh had an experience and and and God really came down and touched her life guess who is right there Mr wri I'm not Mr Wright but yeah her husband was was right there but I remember remember when when about the Holy Ghost it senses danger it know something something in me fortunately I I had a little bit uh God had taught me some things and I had seen some things and the Holy Ghost In Me said as much as I want to talk to you and I I think by now I don't have to tell you that there obviously was something in me that loved her I hope you know that cuz I married her so obviously I didn't even know how much I liked her at the time but I said as much as I I want to talk to you I said if you're here at this Camp next year I'll talk to you then because I want you to be able to grow in the Lord that was the Holy Ghost and I broke down and I knew she worked at a bakery and so I called every Bakery in Lima Ohio fortunately Lima is small and there was only three of them first one she went by Gabby no Gabby there second one no Gabby there third one is Gabby there yeah one moment she got on the phone and that Holy Ghost said you said you wouldn't talk to her for a year hello click that was the Holy Ghost because it there around that time God now was confirming the work in her life and filling her with the Holy Ghost and what would I have been a distraction right and so that's that's Satan always wants to offer a substitute and that's how Satan works it's it's not a bad thing I mean you'll finally be able to give to the church you'll finally be able to support missionaries and all you got to do is work on on Sunday just once in a while it might seem even like a good thing but remember we got to go back to the Bible right amen so we're thirsting for God Satan wants to offer you a substitute he wants to offer you something different he wants to be able to offer you the things of the world but as I was trying to say nothing in this world can ever satisfy the thirst for God I've often wondered you know is is is that potentially why Elon Musk and Bill Gates and all them are still working I'm sorry but if I had a net worth of some like I don't know what's what's the guy who made a bunch of money off of books online Jeff bezo I mean I don't know about you but if I had some $140 billion dollars I'd build a church for everybody in the message I'd buy maybe I'd just go buy some islands and we'd all go I don't know all I know is I wouldn't be working right but I I but but there's a something in that's thirsting for something you would think 20 billion would have been enough 40 billion would have 100 billion would have been it's not enough so a new house ain't going to be enough a a better job's not going to be enough you know there's only one thing that's enough Hallelujah there's only one thing that's enough Saints and that is him and his word and that is enough and I want to say it's more than enough that's that thirst that's inside of you you're hungering you're thirsting for more it ain't going to be a boyfriend it ain't going to be a girlfriend it ain't going to be a new job it ain't going to be a career it ain't going to be a bigger house it ain't going to be a bigger car none of those things are ever going to satisfy The Thirst there's only one thing naturally and spiritually and for a predestinated Son of God religion ain't going to do it a partial truth ain't going to do it screaming and shouting ain't going to do it speaking in tongues ain't going to do it just a one-time experience ain't going to do it no it's going to have to be walking with Jehovah it's going to be having to come in behind the veil oh I love how the prophet of God says when you come in behind the veil and it drops down when you're in there it's soundproof it keeps all the world out all of the voices and all the substitutes that are trying to come in and say oh you need this and you need I can't hear you it's soundproof in here the only thing I can hear is the word I'm thirsty I'm thirsting for God Lord my heart panteth after thee not the things of the world but we let things come in why do you hunger why do you thirst Church he's wanting to reveal this great secret Revelation to you but we let so so many things take it out of you I believe that's in Christ The Mystery of God revealed same thing right you're thirsting you're hungering but we're allowing other things to come in in paragraph 87 that's where he said he said he perverts the true nature of God and the true thirst of God of the body and soul by lust for sin he he says there's a thirst for Joy there's a thirst thirst for Fellowship God put that in you that you would thirst after him that's that paragraph that he said he said God Made You to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of thirst with some other kind of perversion of the correct thirst see how it's in the natural see how it's in the spiritual we think as long as we join the church that settles it that's all we have to do no you got to keep feeding keep feeding the Holy Ghost the word cuz if you don't maybe you do something it goes out on a limb some of us just need to stop repent say Lord I'm wrong I need to get back in fellowship with you forgive me of my sins so many times people come for prayer and they they they they have a desire on their heart and what is it they're thirsting and and and they're they're they're they're they're wanting to have more more of this and more of that and sometimes you know it's just you know what to do you don't need a lightning bolt from God you know we know what we need to do you want to be successful get up that what the pastor said you want to be what what's the things that natural successful people do what was our pastor trying to point out those are the things if you want to be a successful Christian you need to do and so many times we know that we need to do we just don't do it remember God is not going to shove you through a pipe and pull you out on the other s side and say Well done my good and faithful servant no you're here for the test you're here for the trial you're here for the victory right what is character it's a victory well victory means you got to have something overcome so he's left things there for you now eternally he already took care of it all that's the rest that's the confidence in knowing that God already took care of that but now you we got a a mountain with Giants on it right but we got to be like Caleb hey man there's some Giants squatting on my Mountain who wants to go kick them off cuz if you don't come with me it doesn't matter I I'll just get all the joy for myself but if you want to go whoop some devils is there anybody that wants to go give the devil a black guy and some of these demons let's go put a herd on them what are you talking about brother I'm talking about being what God Made You God made you an overcomer you're going to have to have things overcome so what do we got to do we got to fight if the devil's taking your your prayer life let's get it back I'm taking it back what the prophet of God saying how can I overcome he said you take the word of God and you hit him with the word and if he don't move you say oh it didn't work I went up for prayer and I'm still feeling the same still got a headache you said by your stripes I'm Healed Lord and I got prayed for I guess it's my lot in life no you take the word and you hit them again and if you still got the headache you hit them again if God give you a promise and you're believing for something I don't care if it's been one year five year 20 years if it's the word of God that it's the same word that was given to Abraham you tell that Old Devil I'm going to have the promise of God in my life and God said by his stripes I'm Healed hit him again take that devil I don't feel any better but by his stripes I'm Healed he said if you lay hands on the sick they shall recover hit them again hit them again hit them again some of you just get to wacking you're thirsting for something get to fight in God Made You to thirst so just continuing on here like I said we ain't going to try to be long but just uh I guess brother brandham comes through paragraph 46 and he starts to talk about how if you don't satisfy the natural thirst you'll die so we see that great uh natural type here in the spiritual that I I if you don't satisfy that thirst for God you're you're going to die just like the not milking the cow not feeding the Holy Ghost the word the things are uh if you neglect it it's it's going to the word of God if you neglect to give the Holy Spirit the word of God you'll die so just picking up in 47 we'll find a place uh uh to to just look for a close and 47 he says The Thirst also I like this is an alarm it's an alarm alarm clock that thirsting no and and I I would say this if you're not careful if if Satan's been able to trick you that when the alarm clock starts going off you're reaching for the wrong thing to satisfy your thirst you know uh brother brandom says that in paragraph 91 he says he says and then there is a great danger also if you don't watch what you're doing in this time if you're thirsting for God be sure it's God you find I want to just say one thing you say well brother Matthew How will I know oh the same way you know if you if you touch an electrical line yes sir I'm sorry if you're going to me and saying hey I think I think I grabbed the hold of that 120 I mean you think he's like yeah you know I kind of got a little A tingle or something no uh-uh now let a lying get a hold of you and you won't you won't be coming over wondering you'll come testifying hey man you are oh man watch out over there that line is not insulated I got shot W I was wondering what happened to your hair it's sticking straight up you don't look the same you ain't talking the same you ain't acting the same but there's a danger the prophet's telling you be sure it's God you find see be sure that it's your thir your thirst is satisfied but if Satan has been able to pervert you from these natural appetites that he'll do it if he can he'll simply make you try to be satisfied he goes on and talking about some things he'll offer you religion he'll offer you a lot of things he'll offer you compromise he'll offer you complacency he'll offer you an AA program what is an AA program it's it's it's putting up with it it's uh I'm trying to find the word for it but you're you're you're you're just you're you're living with the problem you're you're learning how to to deal with it once an addict always an addict well we're not we're not called to live like that that thirst is trying to draw you into a place where when you come in contact with him you know that you know that you know that you know and then when Satan comes and tries to war at you in your mind and and get you to cause all these questions and you're getting you're getting so worried and do I have the Holy Ghost do I not have the Holy Ghost what is you're thirsting don't just just go to the word come on so many times the question Satan poses the question and you don't look into the word for the answer well maybe I maybe I don't got the Holy Ghost yeah maybe I did make you know what quit doubting quit wondering get into the word Lord I don't know where I'm at but you called me I don't know whether I'm here or there but Lord I'm in your hands I Lord I I I didn't I didn't find you you found me Lord and if you started the work you're going to finish the work all the father has given me will come no man cometh unto the father unless the father D me Lord it was you drawing me and you you're not going to draw me partway you're not going to draw me halfway look I want to tell you my God's the greatest fisherman in the world has ever seen there ain't no fish that gets off his line he got the hook of predestination and when it's hooked didn't you I don't care how far you run I don't care how many Twigs you get tied up in and how bad the situation looks and you think you're stuck like stuck can be my God when he starts reeling you in you're coming he'll move mountains he'll move worlds he'll cast out demons he'll change the hearts of men but one thing he'll do he will not leave you in that condition he's coming for you because all the father has given me will come and in no lies will he ever cast you out right you're coming you're coming home amen so is our our prodical sons and daughters you're coming home we're not leaving a hoof behind whack them hit them again that's the word but if you neglect the word you know what happens if you don't throw Another Log on the Fire what happens Church the fire goes out that's in the natural the prophet's telling you the reason you're going through what you're going through all you got to do Throw Another Log on the Fire and sometimes we go through seasons and you don't feel the joy you don't feel the love you feel all alone it's part of your character being built up and in that time what do you do look feeding the Holy Ghost the word has nothing to do with your emotions I I'll never I'll never forget one time brother Tim puit told me we were just having some fellowship some many years ago maybe 24 or 25 years ago I just and this phas what he told me just stuck with him me I'll never forget he said some he said brother Matthew you know sometimes you have to force feed yourself and you know I I I probably thought I knew what he meant you know I was young just starting to serve the Lord you know I thought yeah yeah you got to force feed yourself sure yeah I'm going to put that all down wait till you get to a place where you you feel like you can't go another step you feel like you can't do another thing and you feel like look I'm sorry we get this you feel like you don't even want to hear the word you feel like I don't why I don't want people to even try to encourage me you're just you feel so despondent you're so at a time and and people try to help and they're not helping they're making it worse you know what you got to do Throw Another Log on the Fire just because you don't feel like the fire's growing just because you don't feel like something's changing you just be obedient to the word Lord you said Lord I'm gonna get into your Bible I'm gonna put on another another sermon I'm going to listen to your word Lord because you said and that's how you continue the fight you keep feeding the Holy Ghost so this alarm clock that goes off he says in 47 oh my we're over time musicians go ahead and come that'll make me quit I didn't want to take too much time tonight we just trying to have a little fellowship and fill in for our pastor he says just come and then we'll see we'll see when we start playing I don't mean to hang y'all out like that but 47 he says The Thirst also is an alarm it's an alarm clock that thirsting the soul sets off the alarm clock a little buzzer inside of you that tells you that death has is lurking nigh if you don't get water pretty soon you you've got to die and it's louder and louder until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die because it's an alarm clock like David described here in Psalms as the heart panth after the water Brook so my soul panteth after thee Oh God as the heart panteth after the water Brook remember brother brandom as he starts the sermon he refers to when he preached thirsting for life and he says I looked up what the definition of thirst was and he said it was a painful desire right it's something that that that that has an effect it's it's a painful desire when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you it's an alarm like the flashing red lights of the sign of his coming something's trying to get your attention say something's happening it gets louder and louder until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die because it's an alarm clock look alarms should be alarming if you have an alarm clock that doesn't wake you up or you sleep through it that's really not an alarm clock it's a I don't know making you feel better that you set your alarm clock but you're really not getting up on time an alarm clock should be so alarming it wakes you up it's painful like my goodness shut that thing off the problem is is we got a snooze button so then what do we do we put it on the other side of the room like man I can't miss this appointment I got to get up I'm going to go put my alarm clock on the other side of the room because I've gotten in a bad habit a hitting snooze quit hitting snooze Church get up you want to be successful get up early quit measuring your success by ladyo and the things of the world look into the Bible you want to know how to be successful look into the Bible we see what lady oia calls successful right fashion and cars and glamour and now I'm not in tune to it but you want to know the new success these days is it's Tik Tock and Instagram and everybody's uh presenting their fake lives you know and and disfiguring themselves and got all these things to make them look like it's it's not and what does it do it's it's creating a thirst a perverted thirst and people oh I like that and I like this and and I want to be like that can I do that can I make my eyelashes look like like that can I do this and that and it's a thirst brother Brandon went through all those things but it's a perverted thirst but I say I want to I want to be successful but I want to be a successful Christian so let's quit looking at lady oia to see what successful is let's look into our Bible I tell you what you want to talk about being successful think about being predestinated that's pretty successful look into your Bible you're predestinated you're more than a conqueror come on hey we're we're closing we're getting out of here our Pastor said quit measuring your success by Lady oia let's start looking into the word of God let's start doing the things that naturally are in us to be successful and let's do it for the word let's do it for the Lord let's look into our Bibles quit measuring the success by the world and start saying you know what Lord you said I'm predestinated you said I'm more than a conqueror you said I can do the Greater Works look into the message the message says you're Justified you never did it in the first place and I I got a little bit excited about this I was thinking about being successful you want to know the what I think the Pinnacle of success is is going in a Rapture if the world can get excited about all of their stuff out there and you know successful people people like to show it off you know at the end of the championship the MVP gets up there and he raises it up and says I'm a champion I'm the MVP I say there ought to be a bride of Christ through humility and a glow of the Holy Ghost you're showing the token I'm going in a Rapture I'm going to wear my hair long and my dresses long and I'm going to let the world know that I can't be bought by the things of ladyo because I've already been bought with a price by the blood of almighty God and I'm not looking to Lady OA for the things of My Success I am thirsting for something else beyond what lady OA can give me I'm thirsting for the one and true God and the one and true God has come in this generation and he has opened up the book he has revealed himself to the bride and oh we behold his face and say that's what I'm thirsting for don't let the devil trade that Holy thirst go ahead and play something we'll just go ahead and [Music] stand don't let Satan substitute and pervert that Holy thirst for the things of the world brother brandham goes on to say talking about David he was a a Woodsman and he would he would see those deer as those wolves or those uh uh uh the animals would come after the deer they would wound the deer and it would get hurt and it would it would start to run and if it would start to bleed out that deer knew it had an instinct in them I got to get to water something in them there was a thirst and I got to get to water because if it doesn't get to water what's going to happen it's going going to [Music] die and he said now if that deer can't find water no water now water has something in it when the deer drinks the water it stops the bleeding oh somebody here you're bleeding you're hurting you've been wounded and you've been [Music] Runing but if it don't get water to cool them off the blood keeps flowing out faster because he's running keeping his heart pumping but if you can ever get to that water the deer will live now there's a great lesson see David's saying here as the heart panth for water Brook my soul panteth after thee oh god oh Hallelujah there's a thirst in you I've got to get to water there's an alarm clock going off I got to get to water and I like how he says that and the deer knows if it gets to that water if it crosses out and doesn't find any more water it'll die so it stays close to the water I say Lord I I want to stay close to you I want to stay close to the water 5070 says as the heart thirst and pant after the water broks my soul thirst after thee Oh God unless I can find you Lord I'll perish I can't go unless I find you and when a man or woman or a boy gets that kind of thirst for God he is going to find something see but when we come at it just kind of halfway well I'll kneel down and see what the Lord does see you're not really thirsting it's got to be a thirst between death and life and then something takes place maybe if God could use this portion of the service and you can open up your heart maybe the Lord's talking to you tonight maybe you've been halfway maybe you've been a little like ananas and saf you've kind of had one foot in and one foot out kind of had a little backup plan kind of one foot out in the things of the world and business and one foot in the word of God that that's that's not what the messenger's talking about you got to come to a place where you say you know what I'm all in you got to get desperate like buddy Robinson I believe it was he said Lord if you don't come tonight when you come back to earth again you're going to find a pile of bones right here oh now we're talking about thirsting between life and death I say let's allow God to come let him Quench and start to satisfy that thirst let them start to deal with your heart now as we end the service you know if the things that you've been doing ain't right and you've been feeding on the things of the world and you've been allowing things to come and take your time and you realize that Lord I've allowed Satan to pervert that thirst for you with other things maybe with every head bowed maybe somebody here just wants to lift their hand to him and say Lord I I feel like that I I haven't I've allowed my channels to get clogged and I've allowed my thirst to be perverted for the things of the world just hands around the building Lord I include myself Lord you've given us a a thirst for you [Music] lord lord I just want to thank you for that Lord cuz where the world's groping in darkness and they're trying to satisfy that thirst with the things of the world you come our way Lord just like that woman at the well I she was she was thirsting and she just couldn't get it right maybe she thought another husband would would satisfy him that didn't work and the next one didn't work and but oh she was a predestinated seed something in her was hungering and thirsting and then you said those great words Lord I have needs to go by [Music] Samaria when you came Lord you said if if you knew the gift of God and who it was that spoke to you you would ask me for a drink and I would give you Living Waters Lord I like her response she said give me this water that I thirst not again Lord that's the water we want tonight we ask that you forgive us Lord for allowing the things of the world to come in and the devil to allow our thirst to get satisfied by the things of the world but Lord we're going to move those out of the way now it doesn't take some big great exercise it just takes a a simple humble heart in humility to say Lord I know I'm wrong and I ask that you forgive me Lord I I didn't want to do it I I really want to serve you with all of my heart and I just I seem not to be able to make the right decisions and I somehow find myself doing things that I don't even want to do and I can say like Paul when I would do good evil is present with me Lord I'm just asking you to come once again and just forgive me God restore me build me back up Lord I'm going to start feeding the fire and start feeding the Holy Ghost the word of God and build my faith back up to know that I can do the Greater Works and that you have predestinated me and I am an overcomer I am justified Lord and all these things that you've done for me Lord I believe them and I say Amen to them Lord I commit the people to you may you just bless them Lord may you just bless our pastor Lord and touch his eye and Lord I just ask for your comfort Lord you touched my mom and lean and my cousins uncle Danny Lord at Linda was so special to us I believe she was a light you gave us Lord sure there's questions and things we can't understand but Lord we don't look to anything other than your word and know that she was your daughter and we thank you for her life Lord and I pray that you would use this moment where you've allowed her to go across the portals into your arms May her family just come closer to you each one of us Closer to You Lord as you spoke about that deer it had a little sense of danger it knew if there was danger lurking Lord May there be a sense in us to know that you're coming is so soon may we heed the flashing red lights of the sign of your coming Lord and get our house in order and repent and take you at your word Lord we just commit everyone to you pray for your comfort for the family a healing touch for all those Lord that have a need and Lord may we just bind ourselves closer together this is a uniting Time Lord where we're drawing closer one to another until that great catching away of your bride we love you Lord we ask these blessings Lord all those hands that were raised pray that you just meet them in their need now in Jesus Christ's name pour your spirit out on me fall just like the rain saturate my thirsty [Music] Soul come and fall aresh on me fill my cup again [Music] my heart and make me I need you
