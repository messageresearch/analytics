[36:29] pertain to Godliness whether it's Grace

[37:01] lust and then we drop down the next few
[37:04] scriptures as you know are the statue of
[37:07] a perfect man but let us drop down to
[37:10] nine but he that lackes these things is
[37:13] blind and cannot see a far off and hath
[37:17] forgotten that he was purged from his
[37:20] old sins Heavenly Father we ask you to
[37:24] bless your word to us in Jesus precious
[37:27] name we pray amen you may be
[37:32] seated amen anybody that has any spare
[37:35] time uh this weekend we will be working
[37:38] around the church so if you feel like
[37:40] coming
[37:42] out feel U please feel
[37:46] free but quite a week hasn't it
[37:49] been you know I would have thought
[37:51] tonight with what's going on in Israel
[37:55] that there wouldn't be a SE seat left in
[37:58] the house of the
[37:59] Lord amen what a uh What uh an
[38:05] amazing
[38:07] event but you know Peter says here he
[38:12] says that uh they can't
[38:17] see uh a far off they couldn't see a far
[38:22] off I was in Vancouver this weekend and
[38:27] they took me for a ride down to the city
[38:30] and they were going to show me some
[38:33] sites and I said I'd like you to take me
[38:36] down to this place that you're talking
[38:39] about where it seems like um the
[38:44] homeless are starting to gather and so
[38:48] they said oh yes I think they call it
[38:50] Hasting Street they
[38:52] said I said I'd like to drive down that
[38:56] and so you know they said no you don't
[38:59] want to go there and they they began to
[39:02] talk but I just felt compelled to drive
[39:06] down there and it wasn't an unfamiliar
[39:09] scene we drove down there and there's
[39:12] tents on the sidewalk and people laying
[39:15] out on the curbs and and everything but
[39:18] that used to be what was considered
[39:23] downtown you know that's where the
[39:25] shopping was that's where the shops were
[39:28] that's where everything was and now it's
[39:32] completely run down for blocks and uh
[39:36] they you know and they make comments
[39:38] like
[39:39] whatever you do uh don't get out of the
[39:42] car and lock the doors of course I'm not
[39:46] afraid of those things because that's
[39:49] where I came from you know that's where
[39:52] I would have been if there wasn't divine
[39:55] intervention in my life and I could look
[39:59] out onto those uh streets and and see
[40:03] myself but I thought you know I I wonder
[40:07] if they ever realized that was
[40:09] coming they couldn't see a far off they
[40:13] couldn't see that the the actions that
[40:16] they were taking and what was
[40:19] transpiring uh every day people wanting
[40:23] to get more wealthy and hoard more
[40:25] wealth and and to to build bigger and
[40:28] make things more expensive that they
[40:31] were grinding out homeless people every
[40:34] day now I feel sorry I know some of them
[40:37] have mental illness but you know they
[40:40] poisoned them with their TVs they
[40:42] poisoned them with alcohol they poison
[40:45] them with drugs and now they they when
[40:48] they started it all they didn't see a
[40:50] far
[40:51] off they could just passed another crazy
[40:55] law in California that that it it's no
[41:00] longer uh I got to say this in a way
[41:03] because we have young people but it it's
[41:07] no longer against the law to loiter and
[41:10] walk on the the street and
[41:14] solicit and and it's caused an outbreak
[41:18] down there that even
[41:20] Californians are shocked at you know uh
[41:25] very of
[41:27] uh just almost nakedness on the street
[41:32] and and I wonder if they could see a far
[41:36] off when they made those
[41:39] decisions you know a lot of people make
[41:42] decisions and they never they never look
[41:45] a far off they never consider what will
[41:48] be the end of the decision I'm making
[41:52] you
[41:53] know uh Gary was sharing with me
[41:57] uh uh something he said you know he says
[42:00] I remember from the sermon birth pains
[42:03] that it was brought out that it's under
[42:06] pressure that people make the worst
[42:08] decisions that they ever make you know I
[42:12] mean they they feel they're pressed in
[42:14] to making an instant decision you know
[42:17] every decision of a Believer should be
[42:19] prayed
[42:21] through amen they should think about it
[42:24] you know what what why am I doing
[42:27] you know I I I remember I counsel so
[42:29] many young men uh that were entering the
[42:33] workforce and boy their boss would say
[42:36] something that would make them mad and
[42:38] up they would pack their tools in the
[42:40] box and they
[42:42] were off you know what I mean I'll go
[42:45] find another job you know one day
[42:47] there's not going to be jobs to find and
[42:50] you're going to have to be able to learn
[42:52] to cope with that you know don't let
[42:54] that guy run you off he's stuck where
[42:59] he's at you know you're learning you're
[43:01] growing you got years ahead of you don't
[43:04] let one hardhead or one mean person uh
[43:09] force you into making a decision that's
[43:11] going to hurt you in the long run that's
[43:14] probably why he's doing it it's just
[43:17] like in school don't let a a a teacher
[43:20] that's uh not friendly or or mean to you
[43:24] or makes fun of you don't let them
[43:26] affect your lifelong decisions you know
[43:31] they're if I could say that they're not
[43:34] going any place you're going to move on
[43:37] to the next grade and they're going to
[43:39] be right there picking on somebody else
[43:42] you know I mean years and years grades
[43:44] are passing you're just starting your
[43:47] life you you got Vision ahead of you
[43:49] there's nothing that you can't do you
[43:52] keep a positive outlook and you move
[43:55] forward
[43:56] so you never let the
[43:58] negative ever throw such an effect on
[44:01] you that it it forces you into a
[44:04] decision you sit back and you look a far
[44:08] off you know what I mean don't let
[44:11] somebody do something to you that puts a
[44:14] root of bitterness in your heart because
[44:17] that person later down the road might be
[44:20] just the person that you need to to have
[44:23] to help you in
[44:25] life you know my best friends were
[44:28] always the ones that I got in a great
[44:29] big fight
[44:31] with you know we didn't like each other
[44:33] we had a fight and after the fight we
[44:36] became friends you know what I mean so
[44:39] you know I'm just getting to something
[44:42] but I I want
[44:43] to let it soak in a little bit about
[44:48] what I'm talking about looking a far
[44:51] off you know what I mean what it means
[44:55] that to
[44:56] uh and you say well the scripture says
[44:58] take one day at a time it does because
[45:02] the evil of that days sufficient that's
[45:06] right but he said look at the Fig Tree
[45:09] you know I me when it begins to put
[45:11] forth buds that's a sign he said look at
[45:15] the Moon look at the look at the sun
[45:17] look at the sky you know what I mean
[45:20] that's that's a sign so we're told in
[45:22] the scripture that we look a far off do
[45:25] you you know that every promise of God
[45:28] is a
[45:29] prophecy that's right amen you know what
[45:32] I mean Jesus said by my stripes you're
[45:36] healed well that just is a promise till
[45:41] one day somebody draws on that promise
[45:44] and somebody's healed if nobody's ever
[45:47] healed then that would have never come
[45:50] to pass and that what everything in the
[45:53] scripture is every promise is telling
[45:55] you what he's going to do I'm not going
[45:58] to leave you I'm not going to forsake
[46:00] you I'm going to be with you even in you
[46:03] so all those things were spoken but yet
[46:06] they if you would have to look a far off
[46:09] to see uh when they come to
[46:13] pass and so it's needful for us
[46:18] especially in this
[46:20] hour and what's going on to sit back and
[46:25] look a far off put on our prophetic
[46:30] scriptural uh eyes
[46:32] have that we can see there's something
[46:36] going
[46:37] on
[46:39] major going on the natural always types
[46:43] the spiritual like I said here before
[46:46] and I set up in Canada we we we are
[46:49] fighting for the
[46:51] Rapture that's right we're fighting for
[46:54] the Rapture and as many many of you know
[46:57] that they there there's a
[47:01] war going on in
[47:04] Israel I mean the most
[47:06] horrific
[47:08] Slaughter since the
[47:10] Holocaust and I don't know if any of us
[47:13] were even alive that are in this
[47:16] room that were even alive
[47:20] during that
[47:21] time but now it's risen again in our
[47:26] generation and like we could go into all
[47:28] kinds of Bible teaching right now about
[47:30] the Four Winds and the angels grabbing
[47:33] the Four Winds and about how the war was
[47:35] stopped and so many things that the
[47:38] prophet of God told us but you know one
[47:41] of the things that everybody's crying
[47:44] out on the news and and in politics and
[47:50] everywhere is it was an intelligence
[47:54] failure that's right thank that's right
[47:57] they didn't see a far off they didn't
[48:00] seeing it coming and we're warned about
[48:03] the thief in the night we're warned
[48:05] about him breaking in and and entering
[48:09] the house if the strongman knew the
[48:11] thief was
[48:12] coming you know what I mean he he would
[48:14] be
[48:15] prepared for it and so this is all that
[48:18] they're saying they're saying it's it's
[48:21] an intelligence failure they they they
[48:24] didn't read the
[48:26] signs they thought they thought there
[48:29] was peace and safety one of our
[48:31] diplomats got up and just boasted two
[48:34] days before there's never been peace
[48:36] like there is now there's there's never
[48:40] been Harmony like there is now there's
[48:43] never been uh uh people working together
[48:47] like they're working
[48:50] now you know when you find out that two
[48:54] people and I'm not talking in the
[48:56] Christian realm but two countries are
[49:00] just acting all cozy to one another one
[49:04] of them's got something up their
[49:07] sleeve they're they're they're they're
[49:10] lulling them to sleep and and that's
[49:14] what they they thought happened
[49:15] everything seemed to be going good
[49:18] everything seemed to be fine nobody was
[49:21] going over the Border nobody was doing
[49:24] everything at and and just for a
[49:28] moment they didn't see a far off how
[49:32] many knows that our Me Prophet mentions
[49:34] that same thing with Pearl
[49:36] Harbor that's right he said they were
[49:38] all drunken and they were all having a
[49:40] good time everything was fine and they
[49:43] should have been able to see my goodness
[49:45] they could have sat up there with
[49:47] binoculars and seeing that thing AAR off
[49:51] you could have just put your ear to the
[49:52] wind and you would have heard all those
[49:55] ples
[49:57] this guy must have been a a a
[50:01] buzzer you know what I mean but let me
[50:03] tell you something I don't know when the
[50:06] 144,000 are going to
[50:09] come but those people are a part of
[50:12] us whether they get white robes whether
[50:16] in the
[50:17] 144,000 they were blinded for our
[50:20] sake amen and their Messiah will return
[50:24] to them
[50:26] you know what I mean it ought to alarm
[50:28] us it ought to put us in
[50:31] prayer it ought to move Upon Our Hearts
[50:33] and spirit but it's also a Time
[50:37] piece that's right we can't let the fact
[50:40] that what's
[50:42] transpiring ought to be a real wakeup
[50:48] call you know a real
[50:51] genuine uh uh examination yes sir of
[50:55] what am I lacking what what's going on
[50:59] you know what I mean uh uh something
[51:03] fixtion to happen I need to look a far
[51:06] off and ask myself am I
[51:12] prepared and that's what the word
[51:15] does the word lets us look a far off how
[51:19] many knows we were told there'll be wars
[51:22] and rumors of
[51:24] wars
[51:26] earthquakes floods have you looked back
[51:29] over lately how many floods there been
[51:33] how many earthquakes there's been but
[51:35] what happens we get so common to those
[51:39] things I remember there used to be a
[51:42] story wasn't it where the little boy
[51:43] cried
[51:44] wolf you know what finally they just got
[51:48] tired of hearing it Peter says they
[51:51] begin to say where are the signs of his
[51:53] coming all things Contin Contin you as
[51:56] they are this is just another thing it's
[52:00] just another war no it's
[52:03] not and let me explain to you my view
[52:08] I'm not preaching Doctrine I'm I'm just
[52:10] sharing with you my view of things and
[52:17] and not to convert
[52:20] you to my view but to inspire you to
[52:25] pray and find your own Outlook your own
[52:30] view your own
[52:32] discernment of what's
[52:35] transpiring can sit back and not let
[52:37] this slip by but let's see what's
[52:42] possibly going on
[52:45] here and we've been touching on these
[52:47] things and I'd like to go over them one
[52:49] more time we talked about the Rich Young
[52:53] Ruler in the message
[52:56] investment he knew he lacked
[52:58] something you what I mean so he he
[53:02] wanted to know uh what must I do to
[53:07] inherit the kingdom of God what a great
[53:10] question
[53:13] amen you know when I begin to come up
[53:16] against certain things then I realize
[53:19] you know I should be farther down the
[53:22] road like I told the our our brothers
[53:25] and sisters in Canada we ought to be
[53:28] progressing
[53:30] spiritually at least as fast as the
[53:34] world is degress that's
[53:38] right we ought to be rising in power
[53:42] amen hallelujah and in
[53:45] understanding and in faith and solid
[53:49] commitment to God's word as fast are as
[53:53] they are running towards all this gender
[53:56] and all this
[53:58] craziness that's going
[54:01] on I we at least ought to match up at
[54:06] least that much you know what I mean we
[54:09] can't afford to be left behind but the
[54:12] rich ruler lacked something so he went
[54:16] to Jesus and said what must I
[54:20] do to inherit eternal
[54:23] life and Jesus says keep all the
[54:27] law all the Commandments and he said
[54:31] I've done all those things from my
[54:35] youth now that ought to tell us
[54:38] something that that wasn't what did
[54:43] it I would like to be able to say that
[54:47] I've never lied I've never hurt nobody
[54:50] I've never stole I never cheated you
[54:53] know what I mean I've never I've never
[54:56] painted the situation just a little bit
[54:59] so it looked
[55:02] favorable this guy was pretty
[55:05] upright but Jesus say you lack one
[55:10] thing sell all you have and follow
[55:14] me now you say why did he tell them that
[55:18] because Jesus could see a far
[55:21] off he could see the pathway
[55:25] that this riches was going to take this
[55:31] man he knew it wouldn't be
[55:35] long that that Spirit would overtake him
[55:39] and his greed would overtake him and
[55:42] then Barnes weren't big enough he had to
[55:45] have bigger he had to have more he had
[55:48] to make more he had he he he wasn't
[55:53] satisfied and other words for from going
[55:56] completely to complete peace and
[56:00] possessing the kingdom of God not being
[56:03] able to see a far off he made a terrible
[56:09] decision and he walked away sorrowful
[56:12] for he had much riches he didn't know
[56:14] that those riches was going to put him
[56:17] in Hell begging for somebody to go tell
[56:21] his
[56:22] family and just to have a drop water put
[56:26] on his tongue see the Lord
[56:30] knew cuz the Lord can see a far off so
[56:34] he intervened in this man's
[56:38] life to try to get him
[56:42] off of the path that he was
[56:47] on but the draw in him to
[56:50] riches and to fame and to recognition
[56:55] and the SE sitting at the feast and and
[57:00] being exalted was greater than the draw
[57:04] in him for eternal
[57:08] life and that's what we've got to
[57:12] really understand and when we talk about
[57:17] understanding your predestination and we
[57:19] talked about that that that we're in a
[57:22] battle for a Rapture yes sir so we want
[57:26] the draw in
[57:28] us to be for eternal life for the
[57:33] Rapture and so
[57:37] uh you know he he didn't feel that
[57:41] pole so we understood when we
[57:44] read in in the message I think it was
[57:48] thinking man filter that when we came
[57:50] into this world we didn't have a
[57:53] chance we were born in sin shaped in
[57:56] iniquity came and speaking life standing
[57:58] in a pile of crumbs and mommy says did
[58:01] you get into the cookie jar Little
[58:04] Johnny no
[58:08] mama not
[58:11] Me Oh Oh you mean not me did it
[58:15] again not
[58:17] me the evidence there everything there
[58:22] the worst person to lie to is yourself
[58:28] you know it's not the time you want to
[58:30] lie to
[58:31] yourself and so the the very we didn't
[58:35] have a chance because we were drawn to
[58:38] those things right the only way God
[58:41] could create in us a nature
[58:45] change because you couldn't change your
[58:48] nature with the nature you had
[58:53] right and you know when when somebody
[58:56] asked the prophet of God how do I know
[58:58] I've got the Holy
[59:00] Ghost I believe it's the interview with
[59:03] I forget the sister's
[59:04] name but he said sis he says look at
[59:08] your
[59:09] nature have your nature changed is there
[59:12] a change in your nature he says that's
[59:15] how you
[59:16] know cuz you could have all the gifts
[59:18] all the healing speak with tongues do
[59:21] everything and and still have that old
[59:23] nature
[59:27] but if you've had that real genuine
[59:29] nature change something's changed in you
[59:32] from the way that you were and do
[59:34] something else pulled you and Drew you
[59:37] to be something else so that's what God
[59:40] did he put a seed in us right and that
[59:44] seed is what Drew us out of the darkness
[59:47] I was a hippie I was a a drug addict I I
[59:50] was into music I had all these things I
[59:53] I had didn't even have it in my
[59:56] mind that there was such a thing as an
[59:59] elect lady a bride and a
[1:00:03] prophet you think I thought oh wonder if
[1:00:06] there's a
[1:00:08] prophet read the
[1:00:11] Bible what a waste of
[1:00:15] time you know I was waiting for the next
[1:00:18] vinyl album to come out where's the next
[1:00:21] concert where's the next lovein you you
[1:00:24] know all kinds of of
[1:00:27] foolishness there was nothing to turn me
[1:00:31] around but I had a seed in me and that
[1:00:36] seed had a
[1:00:38] season you understand there came a time
[1:00:43] when that
[1:00:45] seed needed the word of God to
[1:00:50] survive remember just like the blade of
[1:00:52] grass underneath the con rete it's got
[1:00:56] to have
[1:00:58] sunlight so it'll do everything it can
[1:01:01] to press its way to the sunlight so that
[1:01:05] seed begin to make a move amen I didn't
[1:01:10] make the move the seed in me made the
[1:01:14] move it was the seed drawing me to the
[1:01:19] word amen cuz a seed had to get the word
[1:01:24] that's started my life to fall to
[1:01:31] pieces I used to like to do things all
[1:01:34] of a sudden I was
[1:01:37] paranoid scared to death policeman drive
[1:01:41] down the road I'd crawl underneath the
[1:01:45] bed totally
[1:01:49] insane wasn't even in my right mind why
[1:01:54] not because of anything other than the
[1:01:59] seed was changing the
[1:02:02] conditions around me
[1:02:06] amen just think of it the very seed in
[1:02:10] my life its pull to the word of God was
[1:02:16] changing the atmosphere in which I was
[1:02:23] living it wasn't just outside forces it
[1:02:27] was him working on the inside changing
[1:02:31] the
[1:02:35] outside think of it where you might have
[1:02:38] lived what kind of life you
[1:02:42] have he tear up your whole world brother
[1:02:45] lante to get you to the word of God he's
[1:02:47] not going to lose
[1:02:51] you it was the seed that did that
[1:02:55] why because life connects with life and
[1:02:59] sin connects with sin there's two sides
[1:03:03] for me two armies for me that's right
[1:03:07] there's a battle coming and it's the
[1:03:10] battle for the
[1:03:13] Rapture the world is moving to a
[1:03:17] place where your convictions and the
[1:03:20] mind of Christ will be
[1:03:23] illegal they're they thinking that
[1:03:27] they're killing you thinking they're
[1:03:29] doing God a
[1:03:31] service if we could get rid of some of
[1:03:33] these voices that cry out against some
[1:03:36] of this
[1:03:39] stuff yeah get rid of the voice yeah
[1:03:43] that's crying
[1:03:44] out that's what they want to do so the
[1:03:50] the seed that was planted in you had a
[1:03:55] purpose and a
[1:03:58] season now
[1:04:01] look place
[1:04:04] this and especially you younger
[1:04:07] people somebody's going to fulfill the
[1:04:13] Rapture there has a seed been planted
[1:04:18] that a rapturing
[1:04:23] seed and I know there's a lot of
[1:04:26] teaching and Doctrine going on and I'm
[1:04:28] not pointing to any people about the
[1:04:31] word coming and the word coming in the
[1:04:34] bride uh this is a leaving
[1:04:38] message the word has come to draw the
[1:04:43] predestinated raptured seed to the
[1:04:47] Rapture that's
[1:04:49] right it's going to draw them in the
[1:04:53] fruit and the reason that God put that
[1:04:57] seed in there because he's got to prove
[1:05:00] his word about coming again and someone
[1:05:05] being caught
[1:05:06] up sir and I believe there's seed in
[1:05:10] here tonight I may not be one of them I
[1:05:14] live like I
[1:05:16] am and I'll be in a Rapture whether it's
[1:05:19] on this side of the Grave or the other
[1:05:21] side of the Grave it makes no difference
[1:05:24] to
[1:05:25] me
[1:05:27] sir but if I'm
[1:05:31] predestinated to that then that becomes
[1:05:35] the fruit of my
[1:05:38] seed there was seed that was planted for
[1:05:41] justification there was seed that was
[1:05:43] planted for sanctification there was
[1:05:46] seed that was planted for the
[1:05:47] restoration of the
[1:05:49] gifts and anybody that was a seed that
[1:05:52] was planted for the restor of the gift
[1:05:54] they're going to continually return back
[1:05:57] to
[1:06:00] that but if you're planted for the
[1:06:04] Rapture amen then your seed is going to
[1:06:08] start
[1:06:09] pulling for the
[1:06:14] Rapture
[1:06:16] now I'm not I'm not the first poll
[1:06:20] brother Ram said it was taking of the
[1:06:23] hand
[1:06:24] and we understood that that was
[1:06:26] attracting the
[1:06:27] people right the second he began to
[1:06:32] discern the thoughts in tense of the
[1:06:37] heart you know a lot of people that were
[1:06:41] happy with the taking of the
[1:06:44] hand cuz that was a carnal yeah
[1:06:49] manifestation they could understand that
[1:06:52] but when it went to him telling people
[1:06:56] they're thinking and then that became
[1:06:59] spiritualism to
[1:07:03] them they didn't they weren't moved by
[1:07:06] that in fact they walked away from it
[1:07:08] and yet there was another group of
[1:07:10] people that embraced it but finally
[1:07:15] came right was the
[1:07:21] word right that's that the first pull
[1:07:25] and then the second pull and we know
[1:07:27] those were signs well eventually the
[1:07:31] word had to come that followed the
[1:07:34] sign and the prophet of God said that
[1:07:37] word was the third
[1:07:40] pull it was
[1:07:43] pulling
[1:07:45] but the third pull didn't
[1:07:51] stop when our messenger left the scene
[1:07:54] right because a lot of you weren't even
[1:07:57] in the
[1:07:58] message but the message got to you
[1:08:01] didn't
[1:08:03] it and and to use the word the
[1:08:08] messenger used you
[1:08:11] conceived the
[1:08:13] word or the seed in you came to life
[1:08:17] because it it was brought to life by the
[1:08:22] word now
[1:08:25] so part of the third
[1:08:31] pole is the seed that was predestinated
[1:08:35] in
[1:08:36] you drawing the word of God to you and
[1:08:41] the word of God drawing the seed to
[1:08:44] itself that's
[1:08:47] right so if I could say
[1:08:50] this the third pull is actually in
[1:08:54] action this
[1:08:56] evening that's
[1:08:59] right there's a
[1:09:02] pull or a
[1:09:05] draw now so
[1:09:10] uh and we we know and we talked about
[1:09:14] filtering everything
[1:09:17] out that comes into
[1:09:21] you except what
[1:09:24] the purpose of that seed is we won't go
[1:09:27] into that this
[1:09:30] evening but if the rapturing
[1:09:36] seed is
[1:09:39] drawing and
[1:09:41] pulling and
[1:09:44] calling you've noticed it in your life
[1:09:46] all of a sudden there's things in your
[1:09:48] life you you don't want in your life
[1:09:52] anymore
[1:09:55] why the tree is pruning
[1:10:01] itself it's happening contrary to your
[1:10:06] flesh even right is the spirit of God
[1:10:09] moving in you bringing you under
[1:10:11] conviction causing you to to walk away
[1:10:15] from things not partaking things you
[1:10:19] just
[1:10:21] uh you don't have a taste for it
[1:10:26] anymore right thinking man's
[1:10:30] filter you're going to start filtering
[1:10:32] it out you don't have a taste in it why
[1:10:35] because there's a seed in
[1:10:39] you that draw to the
[1:10:43] Fulfillment of the prophesied word
[1:10:46] concerning
[1:10:49] it and the seed
[1:10:52] itself start changing the
[1:10:57] atmosphere both in and on the
[1:11:01] outside first of all you can't stand
[1:11:06] sin I used to like
[1:11:09] this you know I really like to listen to
[1:11:12] this I like to listen to this you know
[1:11:14] all of a sudden the the best voice in
[1:11:17] the world just don't sound the same to
[1:11:20] you the lyrics that moved you all of a
[1:11:24] sudden sound
[1:11:28] stupid just to think we used to walk
[1:11:30] down the street singing yeah yeah yeah
[1:11:35] yeah yeah
[1:11:39] yeah yeah
[1:11:43] yeah
[1:11:45] really somebody checked my
[1:11:49] brain the seed no longer loves that
[1:11:54] it's got a new voice it's got a new
[1:11:58] call if I could say it this way it's got
[1:12:01] a new set of
[1:12:06] Senses now this seed that's in you is on
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:12] move it starts changing your atmosphere
[1:12:14] starts changing it's starting to move to
[1:12:17] that condition that it can come
[1:12:21] forth now
[1:12:26] here we're
[1:12:28] entering the draw of the
[1:12:31] seed to the
[1:12:35] Rapture Israel's got to get in its
[1:12:41] Homeland starts to we see it
[1:12:44] there all of a sudden you say what in
[1:12:47] the world caused those people to go into
[1:12:51] Israel and to start
[1:12:55] slaughtering them in the most
[1:12:59] Unthinkable ways
[1:13:02] imaginable if we were all adults
[1:13:05] here I would start telling you some of
[1:13:10] the atrocities but they give me
[1:13:16] nightmares you say what's causing that
[1:13:19] the
[1:13:22] seed
[1:13:25] the world's got to get in the
[1:13:28] condition it's changing the outside it's
[1:13:31] changing the for face of politics it's
[1:13:35] changing the face of Israel you don't
[1:13:37] think there's people in Israel right now
[1:13:40] that on their knees asking God why
[1:13:43] that's right you don't think there's
[1:13:45] Hungry Heart screaming out you don't
[1:13:48] think there's The Holy Spirits over
[1:13:50] there starting to
[1:13:52] move on those
[1:13:56] people you say well no they they can't
[1:13:59] help
[1:14:01] it if that seed is in them then they're
[1:14:05] going to have a season and God will do
[1:14:08] whatever he takes to make that seed to
[1:14:12] start to pursue his journey now I just
[1:14:16] wonder if there's people in Israel that
[1:14:19] are called to be a part of that group or
[1:14:23] there
[1:14:24] parents or their children might be even
[1:14:27] though they may not be here the seed
[1:14:30] that's in them because it was in your
[1:14:32] father it was in your
[1:14:38] grandfather I wonder if that seed isn't
[1:14:41] start making the
[1:14:45] move so it's going to change the
[1:14:48] condition so that seed can be brought
[1:14:52] forth
[1:14:54] that's
[1:14:57] right that's what's going
[1:15:02] on that's going on because there's a
[1:15:06] Rapture that's going on because there
[1:15:08] Souls called in
[1:15:10] Israel that's going on so you can put on
[1:15:16] isav and
[1:15:22] see it ought to be the most important
[1:15:26] thing in your
[1:15:28] life right
[1:15:31] now is what does the word
[1:15:38] say do we have lowering
[1:15:44] Skies do we have wars and rumors of wars
[1:15:47] earthquakes in diverse places Israel's
[1:15:50] gathering in their
[1:15:52] Homeland do you know Israel right now is
[1:15:55] more
[1:15:56] united than they've ever
[1:16:00] been do you know they had political
[1:16:03] factions in
[1:16:05] Israel just as
[1:16:09] divided as Democrats and Republicans
[1:16:12] that's right Hardline Jews stay with the
[1:16:16] law stay with Israel liberal Jews let's
[1:16:19] open our borders let's do all
[1:16:22] this
[1:16:25] you think there's anybody
[1:16:29] separated could you imagine if someone
[1:16:31] came in here and took our loved ones
[1:16:33] took our
[1:16:34] children do you think I'd be going over
[1:16:36] here do you believe in the third
[1:16:41] pool do you believe this you do believe
[1:16:44] that
[1:16:45] uhuh are you a
[1:16:47] brother my children will you plow take
[1:16:50] your sword your plow and beat it into a
[1:16:53] sword and follow
[1:16:58] me no there' be no
[1:17:04] division there would be
[1:17:06] Unity do you understand what's going on
[1:17:09] right now is one of the
[1:17:13] signs the
[1:17:15] uniting time and sign cuz the seed's got
[1:17:20] to unite with the word that seed in
[1:17:23] Israel predestinated it's got to unite
[1:17:26] with the message that God has for
[1:17:31] him and look at
[1:17:36] us we're going to still miss
[1:17:40] communion we're going to still miss foot
[1:17:43] washing we're not going to come back to
[1:17:46] evening
[1:17:47] Services we're not going to sacrifice
[1:17:50] Wednesday
[1:17:52] night
[1:17:54] and I'm not talking about emergencies
[1:17:56] and things like
[1:17:58] that I'm talking about when it's just
[1:18:01] plain a harder
[1:18:07] choice if you can't make this
[1:18:11] squeeze you're never going to make the
[1:18:14] next
[1:18:19] squeeze I just want to ask tonight are
[1:18:22] we looking a far
[1:18:24] off can you see what's happening now
[1:18:27] around you and can't you understand
[1:18:30] they're starting to squeeze
[1:18:34] you they're starting to it's in your
[1:18:38] face what they want to teach your kids
[1:18:41] in your
[1:18:44] face no respect for God in your
[1:18:48] faith you're getting squeezed whether
[1:18:51] you realize it or not
[1:18:53] I just pray tonight we can look a far
[1:18:58] off and we can
[1:19:01] recognize what's
[1:19:04] transpiring and we'll make
[1:19:07] contact with the seed in us that's
[1:19:11] drawing us cuz that seed will draw if
[1:19:16] you're elected and it will start
[1:19:18] changing your life so don't be dismayed
[1:19:25] at the
[1:19:26] pull that's coming in you thinking not
[1:19:29] strange at the fiery darts of the enemy
[1:19:32] that the trying of your faith is more
[1:19:35] precious than
[1:19:38] gold we're really at a time
[1:19:42] church I don't think it's a political
[1:19:45] war at
[1:19:46] all I think it's the beginning of the
[1:19:49] greatest spiritual
[1:19:51] battle that the bride ever been
[1:19:55] in the seed in
[1:19:58] you is what's
[1:20:02] controlling the world around
[1:20:06] you the seed wants to
[1:20:10] leave and it'll make your life where you
[1:20:12] don't want to stay in
[1:20:17] it
[1:20:21] no
[1:20:23] those that love the
[1:20:25] world and the things of the
[1:20:28] world the love of God isn't even in them
[1:20:33] John
[1:20:37] said the messages having a great
[1:20:40] hour we're building bigger churches
[1:20:42] bigger congregations all over the
[1:20:48] country but that's no
[1:20:51] sign never was was a sign to the
[1:20:56] bride Israel was always one of our
[1:21:01] signs the
[1:21:03] desire of the
[1:21:07] believer and a hungering for truth and
[1:21:10] righteousness was the other sign and
[1:21:13] then we had the
[1:21:15] sign of Malachi 4:5 which told us these
[1:21:20] things were coming so I just
[1:21:24] say to you
[1:21:26] individually in the light of
[1:21:30] everything that's
