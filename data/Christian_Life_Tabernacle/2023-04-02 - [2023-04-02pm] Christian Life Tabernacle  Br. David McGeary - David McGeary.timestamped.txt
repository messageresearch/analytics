[48:02] Jesus Christ who cleanse us from all

[48:52] wasn't it
[48:53] yeah
[48:53] nobody's got anything on us
[48:56] sorry
[48:59] anyway that's the way I feel
[49:02] you know you got to be honest right hey
[49:06] man let's open our Bibles up over to the
[49:10] uh
[49:11] book of uh Nehemiah and we're gonna just
[49:15] I'm just going to build on a little
[49:18] something that uh
[49:22] my brother preached this morning and
[49:24] I just kind of add to it I think it was
[49:27] a wonderful theme
[49:29] for the day I think it fits in with the
[49:33] things that were fellowshipping around
[49:36] and uh
[49:38] let's we'll read the 19th and the 20th
[49:40] verse of the third chapter and and again
[49:45] I don't know these names are are kind of
[49:48] hard for me to pronounce but I never
[49:51] could spell or read and that's because
[49:55] real early I figured they all had it
[49:58] wrong
[49:59] and I had it right I would
[50:02] I was a phonetic speller I I just kind
[50:06] of went how the word sounded you know
[50:09] and um
[50:11] but anyway so I've never had that gift
[50:13] my I always felt a spirit I I always
[50:17] felt it Sprite
[50:19] and so the kids grew up under the
[50:22] anointing of the Holy Sprite
[50:24] and so they used to they used to go to
[50:28] the store and point to the shelf and
[50:30] said Daddy there's some of that Sprite
[50:32] that your spirit that you talked about
[50:35] you know and uh but anyway so you just
[50:39] bear with me it's nice to have things
[50:41] I'd leave our brother uh quote there
[50:43] that God bless you brother nice to have

[51:07] school
[51:08] I went on the playground two days the
[51:10] first day me and somebody was having it
[51:12] out
[51:13] and you know what I fought everybody and
[51:15] all those people that ever got in a
[51:17] fight with were my best friends and uh
[51:20] so there's only one guy I'm in a fight
[51:22] with that's not my best friend and we'll
[51:25] talk about him tonight in a different
[51:27] light uh anyway so let's read here it
[51:30] says but uh sand Bal
[51:34] at I guess
[51:36] and
[51:39] hormonite

[51:48] anybody want to give that a try
[51:53] all right there we go and the
[51:57] and the servants the amorites and the
[52:01] jejumites and
[52:03] uh
[52:05] Arabian heard it they laughed us to
[52:09] scorn and despised us and said what is
[52:13] this thing that ye do
[52:15] will ye rebel against the king
[52:19] then answered I them and said unto them
[52:23] the god of Heaven
[52:25] he will prosper us
[52:27] and I like that the god of heaven will
[52:31] prosperize
[52:33] amen and it says therefore we his
[52:37] servants
[52:38] will arise and build
[52:42] but ye have no portion nor right nor
[52:46] Memorial in Jerusalem Heavenly Father we
[52:51] ask you to bless your word and your
[52:52] precious name we pray amen you may be
[52:55] seated this evening
[53:00] you know our brother spoke this morning
[53:02] about the believer's right
[53:05] to bring his petition uh to the throne
[53:11] and we and we listen to a wonderful
[53:14] piece a message uh out of I believe it
[53:17] was the restoration of the Bride treat
[53:19] about the believer's right to take the
[53:23] word of God and to go uh bring that and
[53:28] lay claim to that which was taken from
[53:33] him
[53:34] and uh and uh
[53:38] there's principles that run through all
[53:41] throughout the scripture and you can
[53:43] always go back through the scripture and
[53:45] you'll find that everything started in
[53:49] uh Genesis and it continues on all the
[53:54] way through into the uh time of the Book
[53:58] of Revelation and this the tactic that
[54:02] Satan used in the beginning in the
[54:06] garden is the same tactic that he
[54:09] continually
[54:11] uses all the way down through time
[54:15] we know that that he picked the battle
[54:18] with Eve the ground that he would fight
[54:21] her on
[54:23] and oppose her and he chose that battle
[54:26] and that was reasoning and that
[54:29] reasoning sets forth in the mind uh
[54:33] where uh the enemy always brings things
[54:37] to consider you know have you considered
[54:42] have you have you thought of this have
[54:45] you thought of that have you thought of
[54:47] this
[54:48] and my goodness and nowadays uh
[54:54] I don't know everything's out there that
[54:58] you can imagine the imaginations of man
[55:00] there you could take you a lifetime in
[55:04] fact they have this thing now they call
[55:06] artificial intelligence that should tell
[55:10] you how good our intelligence is if our
[55:15] intelligence can produce something
[55:17] that's artificial
[55:19] that's going in the wrong way well this
[55:21] great artificial intelligence that they
[55:24] have they now are saying we better slow
[55:26] this down
[55:28] because it's starting to do things that
[55:31] they didn't know it could do
[55:34] it's got built in
[55:37] algorithms is that what it's good
[55:45] I think I said it right
[55:47] it's got these built-in doodads that can
[55:51] that can just go out there and and uh
[55:55] you know grab information and put it
[55:58] together and and one guy came up he's a
[56:02] great military guy that's in charge of
[56:04] our stuff he says well we did a test and
[56:08] we asked it to find flaws in our system
[56:12] and I I'd forget what it was in 13 hours
[56:15] or something it found three or four
[56:17] major flaws and it all of a sudden
[56:20] dawned on them that everybody's got this
[56:24] well you know it didn't take uh didn't
[56:27] take me very long to know because that
[56:30] there's a flaw in the system because it
[56:33] said Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[56:35] my word will not pass away so I know
[56:38] that anything that's contrary to the
[56:40] word of God's flawed already you know
[56:43] what I mean the whole life flawed the
[56:45] whole civilization thought whole
[56:47] education thought it's all flawed
[56:49] because it's where is it leading is
[56:52] leading to destruction there's there's
[56:54] no truth in it there's no reality in it
[56:57] it isn't what lasts but that they're
[56:59] saying he says oh no he said this this
[57:02] artificial intelligence is going to put
[57:05] 300 million people out of work
[57:13] and you know then I thought oh my I
[57:16] thought I I guess that's not too bad for
[57:18] me I I don't work much anymore and and
[57:22] it's okay and and then I got to thinking
[57:25] about oh what about the the young people
[57:27] that are coming up and after just one
[57:30] more burden to to put on him you know
[57:33] what I mean one thing oh what am I going
[57:35] to do what am I going to do for work
[57:37] what am I going to do for this and and
[57:39] I'm not smart and all this you if you
[57:42] know and then all that stuff floods in
[57:44] and people are out there and people are
[57:47] going to doctors now because they've got
[57:50] environmental anxiety and they're
[57:52] worried about the air and they're
[57:54] worried about the Sun and they're
[57:56] worried about this and now they're
[57:58] worried about a machine taking their job
[58:01] and and all these things and all this
[58:05] pressure is coming on and I thought you
[58:07] know the believer
[58:09] all he's got to do is sit down a moment
[58:12] and get in the presence of God and and
[58:15] Let the Peace of the Lord settle in
[58:18] their heart and and just come in and
[58:20] just think a moment you know he said he
[58:22] said the righteous shall not beg bread
[58:26] now I don't I don't know uh how that
[58:30] will be
[58:32] but I know it will be because he said so
[58:35] I know that the righteous will not beg
[58:38] bread whether they have two loaves of
[58:42] bread and three fishies are are whatever
[58:46] manner it comes into that that we have a
[58:50] God that's Jehovah Jireh that he'll
[58:53] provide for his own and that that that's
[58:57] never laid to rest
[58:59] you understand as our brother said this
[59:02] morning that's built in to the law of
[59:05] God from eternity when God spoke that in
[59:09] eternity he knew what lied ahead amen so
[59:13] you don't make Provisions for something
[59:16] that's not there you know what I mean
[59:19] you make perfusions so he made a
[59:21] provision for us he made a sacrifice for
[59:24] us well we were yet centered you know
[59:27] before well we were yet sinners he died
[59:29] for us he made a provision for it so the
[59:32] very law of God itself the and the law
[59:36] of God is the word of God it's the
[59:38] essence of God it could what the law is
[59:42] is what God spoke into motion and
[59:47] whatever he spoke he knew the beginning
[59:49] of it and he knew the end of it and
[59:53] there's nothing in between that can stop
[59:55] it
[59:58] the best the enemy can do is hinder it
[1:00:03] but he can't stop it
[1:00:06] unbelief does not stop God all that the
[1:00:10] father had given me will come
[1:00:14] in that settled and and I believe that
[1:00:18] uh it's a desire of the heart because
[1:00:21] when I I Look to what the Lord trying to
[1:00:25] tell us and I think that's what he's
[1:00:27] trying to call his children back to
[1:00:29] because it was such a theme of the
[1:00:32] messenger of the hour to come back to
[1:00:34] the church and look at the
[1:00:36] denominational systems and look what
[1:00:39] they were running after they were
[1:00:41] building they were
[1:00:42] making big systems there there were men
[1:00:46] rising up in their midst of prestige and
[1:00:51] and there begin to become doctors and
[1:00:53] Scholars and people that supposedly knew
[1:00:58] more about the word that that the people
[1:01:01] were beginning to shrink back from what
[1:01:04] their inheritance were they became
[1:01:06] afraid to partake in what that was given
[1:01:09] them to partake in but you understand
[1:01:12] that what's given to the Church depart
[1:01:15] partaken
[1:01:17] and laid out in the in the promises of
[1:01:21] God that these a Twain would be one
[1:01:25] and he became us that we could become
[1:01:28] him and and what his desire for us to
[1:01:33] come to is the place that we would not
[1:01:36] feel it robbery to be equal to God
[1:01:40] another if I could say it this way the
[1:01:43] thoughts that God had of you in the
[1:01:46] beginning what he knew of you what he
[1:01:49] made you to be that you wouldn't be
[1:01:51] afraid you wouldn't be fearful to step
[1:01:54] up and to be what he said you could be
[1:01:59] that you'd be willing to take that
[1:02:01] position
[1:02:03] and you you've got to take that
[1:02:07] out of the hands of the enemy you got to
[1:02:10] go possess that because he points at the
[1:02:13] weaknesses of your flesh he points at
[1:02:15] your shortcomings he he points at
[1:02:17] everything about you that is weak and
[1:02:21] frail
[1:02:23] but that's not what you're built in
[1:02:26] you're not built in your strength it's
[1:02:29] not by strength it's not by might but
[1:02:32] it's by my spirit saith the Lord it's by
[1:02:35] his spirit that you will be there it's
[1:02:38] by his spirit that he will overcome it
[1:02:41] doesn't matter what weaknesses you have
[1:02:44] because he has the ability and the power
[1:02:46] over the weakness
[1:02:50] and that's why we keep pressing the mark
[1:02:53] and we know that and and I'm not the
[1:02:56] only Bible person that teaches uh out of
[1:03:00] nehemiah's
[1:03:02] preachers that preached out of esri
[1:03:04] Nehemiah
[1:03:06] for ages and and it's always the same
[1:03:10] theme many ministers and doctors and
[1:03:13] books and things have been written at
[1:03:15] the type of the building of the wall as
[1:03:18] the type of the building of the
[1:03:20] Christian these are simple things we see
[1:03:23] in the word of God let's go back as we
[1:03:26] talked about this place in Nehemiah
[1:03:29] where
[1:03:31] they are there building the wall
[1:03:34] but we know 16 years later uh that
[1:03:39] earlier that when the Great king Cyrus
[1:03:43] took over the Babylonian Empire and we
[1:03:48] know the story how the Jews were carried
[1:03:50] off into captivity under Babylon and how
[1:03:54] that all the temple gold and Temple
[1:03:57] items of worship and everything and that
[1:04:00] God the scripture says that God moved
[1:04:03] upon that king's heart
[1:04:06] oh my I I could preach on that for hours
[1:04:09] and hours and hours how many has ever
[1:04:12] seen God move on somebody else in your
[1:04:15] behalf
[1:04:17] amen I I I'll tell you the God's a
[1:04:20] wonderful God I know I tell you this
[1:04:22] story but it Thrills my heart I remember
[1:04:24] I bought a piece of I bought an old old
[1:04:27] Lexus you know the thing was probably 13
[1:04:30] 14 years old and I bought it you know
[1:04:32] but I was young back then and I thought
[1:04:34] of it had an L on the front of it it
[1:04:37] made you something special
[1:04:39] you know what I mean and uh
[1:04:43] okay and uh I I really think that L
[1:04:45] stands for a look the other way because
[1:04:48] this is just really a Camry with a l
[1:04:52] Road on it you know what I mean but if
[1:04:54] you like that letter L we'll charge you
[1:04:57] fourteen thousand dollars more and you
[1:04:59] can walk that around and feel important
[1:05:01] you know and I bought this car and it
[1:05:03] was kind of a one very good it's a good
[1:05:06] car but
[1:05:07] um I don't know it just seemed like the
[1:05:09] transmission Went Out Boy and I worked
[1:05:12] on a speech for that guy for days and
[1:05:15] days and days you know and they sold me
[1:05:17] the car I don't know probably five or
[1:05:19] six thousand dollars you know and and I
[1:05:22] think they were embarrassed that the
[1:05:24] thing was on their lot and they was just
[1:05:26] hoping someone hurried come by and get
[1:05:28] it off there you know but well I drove
[1:05:30] out of there thinking that you know I
[1:05:32] was built for Success because I was
[1:05:35] driving a 15 year old Lexus you know
[1:05:37] what I mean and and I remember the
[1:05:40] transmission went out on it now I just
[1:05:42] got to the place and I thought man I'm
[1:05:44] gonna go read this guy the right act and
[1:05:46] well I'm going to tell him and boy I was
[1:05:49] just really gonna let him have it and
[1:05:53] like the time I was going to put the
[1:05:55] skunk oil on my shoes and walk through
[1:05:58] the bank because a check bounce that I
[1:06:01] didn't think should bounce you know I I
[1:06:04] don't know if any of you have mind
[1:06:05] battles but uh I got a real active mind
[1:06:08] if you know what I mean and uh so anyway
[1:06:12] I I went down there and I remember I Was
[1:06:15] preparing to go and the Lord come down
[1:06:18] spoke to me
[1:06:19] and he said go in there and do this just
[1:06:23] ask him
[1:06:24] you know humble yourself
[1:06:28] and ask him
[1:06:30] so I went there and I sat down and of
[1:06:33] course that one little guy sitting on
[1:06:35] this shoulder saying let them have it
[1:06:37] and the other guy said
[1:06:39] just do it I say
[1:06:42] so I sat down there and I said sir I
[1:06:44] said you know just to be honest with you
[1:06:47] this was probably a little better card
[1:06:49] than I can drive and
[1:06:50] and
[1:06:51] the transmission went out and I don't
[1:06:54] think I have the money to
[1:06:56] fix it
[1:06:58] and the lord gave me the words to is
[1:07:00] there anything you can do to help me
[1:07:03] you know the Lord moved upon that guy
[1:07:07] then he said I'll tell you what I can do
[1:07:09] for you David
[1:07:10] and and I began to realize that he
[1:07:13] probably sold 70 80
[1:07:15] 000 cars all day long
[1:07:18] you know what I mean I mean uh you know
[1:07:21] my little six dollars and fifty cents an
[1:07:23] hour on his uh little application form
[1:07:27] probably didn't match up to the six
[1:07:31] seven hundred thousand dollar a year
[1:07:32] payments and incomes that people were
[1:07:36] making but he said I'll tell you what I
[1:07:38] do David he said if you'll just pay for
[1:07:41] the parts
[1:07:42] I'll fix it all up for you and he did
[1:07:46] exceedingly and abundantly above what I
[1:07:48] could even ask her thing
[1:07:50] and God moved upon him on my behalf
[1:07:55] and that's the Gateway
[1:07:58] of humility
[1:08:01] because it's human nature to resist the
[1:08:05] proud and the arrogant if it's human
[1:08:08] nature I've seen it with guys on job
[1:08:10] sites I've seen it in in car dealerships
[1:08:15] I've seen everything where those egos
[1:08:18] get battling it no longer has nothing to
[1:08:21] do with anything but I'm just I'm not
[1:08:23] going to give an inch and you're not
[1:08:25] going to give an inch and and it's just
[1:08:27] a great big goal uh you know a bull
[1:08:30] fight and and you know bless God you
[1:08:33] know what I mean and everybody's ready
[1:08:36] to rumble you know what I mean and you
[1:08:38] get two losers
[1:08:41] but remember humility is the doorway for
[1:08:45] God to come move on your behalf if
[1:08:49] you'll just take the humble side if
[1:08:51] you'll just humble your sight leave
[1:08:53] you'll just sit back and place it as we
[1:08:56] heard this morning place it back in the
[1:08:58] Throne of God place it back in the law
[1:09:01] of God said Lord you said you'd fight my
[1:09:03] battles because Lord I I may have got
[1:09:07] myself in this position like the song
[1:09:10] says Satan got me in trouble but Jesus
[1:09:13] got me out and just let God work for you
[1:09:16] it works Church it works taking the
[1:09:19] humble way works every time amen because
[1:09:23] he's got you and you know we have the
[1:09:26] same right I've got your back he's got
[1:09:28] you he's got you so much that nothing
[1:09:31] can pluck you out of the palm of his
[1:09:34] hand you take in the humble side will
[1:09:36] never never hurt you
[1:09:39] it'll never hurt you but it will allow
[1:09:43] him
[1:09:44] to identify himself with you because you
[1:09:49] are manifesting one of his attributes
[1:09:51] now he's got a pathway to come and work
[1:09:55] on your behalf
[1:09:58] but he can't bear Witness
[1:10:01] to a bad attitude he can't bear witness
[1:10:05] to something that's not like him
[1:10:09] it's okay I could never say enough words
[1:10:13] even the scripture says that he humbled
[1:10:15] himself even unto the death of the cross
[1:10:23] that's something
[1:10:26] and what did it do it changed the world
[1:10:29] so let's turn back over here to Ezra
[1:10:31] just for a moment I'm just going to go
[1:10:33] through this real quick
[1:10:36] and
[1:10:38] and uh
[1:10:43] so this is 16 years earlier
[1:10:46] King Cyrus lets the Jews return back to
[1:10:49] Jerusalem
[1:10:51] and of course we know that
[1:10:54] Nebuchadnezzar sacked a Jerusalem he
[1:10:56] tore it down burnt the gates tore down
[1:10:58] the Walls now the Jews are returning
[1:11:01] back to that land
[1:11:03] and the first thing that they want to do
[1:11:06] is they want to build the temple
[1:11:08] so the book of Ezra is the building of
[1:11:10] the temple but in the fourth chapter
[1:11:13] of the book of Ezra it reads like this
[1:11:15] this is well it
[1:11:18] I'm not going to read it the way it's
[1:11:20] written but you read it that's the way
[1:11:22] it's written uh anytime I read these
[1:11:25] names and everything I think there's a
[1:11:27] general word they have for it called AB
[1:11:29] living
[1:11:30] now when the adversary of Judah and
[1:11:34] Benjamin heard that the children of the
[1:11:38] Captivity built the temple unto the Lord
[1:11:41] God of Israel then they came to zerubula
[1:11:45] and the chief of the fathers and said
[1:11:48] unto them let us build with you
[1:11:52] for we seek your God as ye do
[1:11:56] and we do sacrifice unto him since the
[1:12:00] days of
[1:12:02] Esser
[1:12:04] hadam king of assur which brought us up
[1:12:08] hither
[1:12:09] now I want you to notice the Heart part
[1:12:13] about these things is that there was a
[1:12:16] law of Separation amongst the Jews
[1:12:21] they weren't supposed to intermarry
[1:12:24] they were supposed to be separate
[1:12:27] do you know that a law always applies to
[1:12:30] God's children
[1:12:31] that were different were separate we're
[1:12:35] not like other people we're not like
[1:12:37] other faiths we're not like other belief
[1:12:40] the very scripture says to it says come
[1:12:42] out from amongst them and be ye separate
[1:12:47] and and it it's a
[1:12:51] it's something that you've got to
[1:12:54] understand that Satan has no part of
[1:12:58] your inheritance
[1:12:59] he has no part of your blessings he he
[1:13:02] he he wants to he he wants to come in
[1:13:06] the disguise of supplying you a blessing
[1:13:10] that he can be a part of your glory but
[1:13:15] God does not share his glory with
[1:13:17] anybody
[1:13:21] he doesn't do it
[1:13:24] it can so many times we'd see things
[1:13:27] that that might appear to be opportunity
[1:13:30] or might it be appear to be a blessing
[1:13:33] but there's a great Revelation and
[1:13:36] understanding in this if God's going to
[1:13:39] provide a way he'll provide the way
[1:13:43] foreign
[1:13:45] you got to just watch
[1:13:48] and make sure
[1:13:50] and these men they knew this they knew
[1:13:52] that it was their Temple
[1:13:55] now these are people that weren't Jews
[1:13:59] they served the same God
[1:14:02] because they were all of the the
[1:14:05] different descendants of Ishmael and and
[1:14:08] different ones so they claimed to be
[1:14:10] Christians
[1:14:13] oh
[1:14:14] but
[1:14:15] you understand
[1:14:18] they've claimed an inheritance
[1:14:20] that wasn't there
[1:14:22] they claimed and and they wanted to
[1:14:25] dilute
[1:14:27] the purity
[1:14:29] of the word of God
[1:14:32] they wanted to dilute the uh the the the
[1:14:36] the the this Temple worship as being the
[1:14:41] place that God placed his name for the
[1:14:44] the children of Israel and Isaac's
[1:14:49] descendants those that were
[1:14:53] circumcised according to uh the uh the
[1:14:59] law and and these things I don't know if
[1:15:02] circumcision was in place at this time
[1:15:04] or not but what I'm saying they were
[1:15:06] separated out
[1:15:09] do you understand what I'm saying right
[1:15:11] that they were a separate yes they this
[1:15:13] they were circumcised they were
[1:15:16] they were separated out so they were a
[1:15:19] separated people
[1:15:22] that's one of the hardest things for us
[1:15:24] to do
[1:15:25] is this day separated
[1:15:28] touch not the unclean thing
[1:15:32] you know it it's difficult because we
[1:15:35] want to do it but I just want to follow
[1:15:36] this little that thought down today
[1:15:38] there's so many ways we can go with it
[1:15:43] and they came into Jerusalem
[1:15:45] and said let us build with you
[1:15:48] for we seek your God and jerus and
[1:15:53] Yeshua and the rest of the chiefs of the
[1:15:57] fathers of Israel said unto them ye have
[1:16:00] nothing to do with us to build and house
[1:16:04] unto our God
[1:16:06] but we ourselves together will build
[1:16:10] unto the Lord God of Israel as king
[1:16:14] Cyrus the King of Persia hath commanded
[1:16:18] us
[1:16:19] then the people
[1:16:21] of the land weakened the hands of the
[1:16:25] people of Judah and troubled them in
[1:16:29] building
[1:16:30] oh isn't that something one moment they
[1:16:34] said let us build let us join in let us
[1:16:36] build this thing and they said no you
[1:16:39] have no part of us
[1:16:43] you don't have a a a a a you don't have
[1:16:47] a part in this
[1:16:48] this is our Temple This Is Our God these
[1:16:52] are our Commandments and we're going to
[1:16:55] keep these Commandments and and we're
[1:16:58] not going to give you access
[1:17:02] to this Temple
[1:17:04] a a part of the inheritance of this
[1:17:08] Temple we are not going to open the door
[1:17:11] for you to come in here and say I'm
[1:17:14] coming into this building and worship
[1:17:17] here and defy the house of the Living
[1:17:19] God and give them an Avenue because they
[1:17:22] said we built it
[1:17:24] we have a right to come in
[1:17:34] he has not changed
[1:17:38] it's the same thing in the garden oh
[1:17:40] surely you won't die
[1:17:42] let me in
[1:17:49] they wanted this great inheritance
[1:17:51] and they said you don't have he says
[1:17:53] then he says then the hands of the
[1:17:56] people
[1:17:57] he said then the people of the land
[1:17:59] weaken the hand of the people of Judah
[1:18:02] and troubled them
[1:18:05] in building
[1:18:06] and hired counselors against them
[1:18:10] to frustrate their purpose
[1:18:13] and the days of
[1:18:15] all the days of Cyrus King of Persia
[1:18:18] even until the reign of Darius King of
[1:18:21] Persia
[1:18:23] and the reign of
[1:18:27] whatever in the beginning of his Reign
[1:18:29] wrote they unto him an accusation
[1:18:33] against the inhabitants of Judah and of
[1:18:37] Jerusalem
[1:18:39] now
[1:18:41] I want you to see that
[1:18:47] the adversary never wants you to build
[1:18:52] what God
[1:18:54] wants you to build
[1:18:57] the scriptures are amazing
[1:19:00] oh
[1:19:01] when it comes to
[1:19:04] the word of God and that's what he's
[1:19:08] saying is God would have never given us
[1:19:10] a weapon
[1:19:12] if he didn't know there was a battle
[1:19:17] so we know that that even in the message
[1:19:20] uh uh the greatest battle ever fought
[1:19:25] the great theme of that message is to
[1:19:28] get the believer to put his faith in his
[1:19:32] weapon
[1:19:35] to believe that the word of God alone
[1:19:39] has the power
[1:19:42] to meet whatever challenge what could be
[1:19:47] brought against you
[1:19:52] look
[1:19:54] and it doesn't matter how he comes
[1:19:57] it doesn't make sense it never made
[1:20:00] sense in the scripture
[1:20:02] for a man with a little young man maybe
[1:20:07] a teenager boy a lot of the historians
[1:20:11] try to make David 14 years old
[1:20:15] you know and uh
[1:20:18] you know I I was visiting with Ariel
[1:20:21] today he's 14 years old
[1:20:24] you know but that's that he's a strong
[1:20:27] nice handsome strong tall young man but
[1:20:32] that's not what the scripture said about
[1:20:34] David David was ready
[1:20:37] probably looked more like me I'm pretty
[1:20:40] ready and so you know just a little guy
[1:20:44] now you would never expect something of
[1:20:48] little like that to meet a giant
[1:20:53] but that's not where David's Faith was
[1:20:55] David's Faith was in the word of God his
[1:20:58] faith was God gave me charge over these
[1:21:02] sheep
[1:21:06] it wasn't the bear
[1:21:08] there wasn't a lion that motivated him
[1:21:13] it was a commission that he had that he
[1:21:16] has given charge over those sheep
[1:21:20] and he was going to do everything he
[1:21:23] could
[1:21:25] to protect that charge
[1:21:29] he didn't know if he was going to defeat
[1:21:31] that line but he's going to fight it
[1:21:35] because he's given charge
[1:21:37] his duty was to drive that line away to
[1:21:41] fight it he didn't know about Kabir
[1:21:43] because Duty was given to fight it he
[1:21:48] was about his duty you know and we've
[1:21:51] been given a duty we've been given a
[1:21:54] duty that in every circumstance we put
[1:21:57] Jesus Christ forward that's what our
[1:22:00] life does we put Christ forward
[1:22:05] someone asked me he said do you and
[1:22:07] sister Leslie ever fight I said we'd
[1:22:09] probably fight a lot more but she's a
[1:22:11] Christian
[1:22:20] you know what I mean
[1:22:23] it don't matter
[1:22:25] you put Christ forward you turn the
[1:22:28] other cheat you take the humble side
[1:22:30] that that's our duty
[1:22:33] and so his charge was my duty is the go
[1:22:39] out and do everything I can to protect
[1:22:42] these sheep the minute he stepped into
[1:22:45] the line of duty God was obligated to
[1:22:48] give him Victorious over that lion
[1:22:52] because he had a throne that he was
[1:22:55] supposed to set on
[1:23:01] if I could say this to you
[1:23:04] this evening
[1:23:06] all things are possible
[1:23:09] I don't know what they are but they're
[1:23:12] still possible
[1:23:15] I don't know what they'll be but they're
[1:23:17] still possible because all things are
[1:23:19] possible to them that believe in the
[1:23:22] Lord
[1:23:26] I'll worry about it when I get there
[1:23:31] but I'm not locked into any circumstance
[1:23:34] I'm not locked into any situation
[1:23:39] I don't care what's there I'll rise
[1:23:41] above it like the song We Sing you know
[1:23:44] you you just set your wings you know if
[1:23:48] if the mountain won't move we'll fly
[1:23:51] amen all things are possible I don't
[1:23:54] know what they are I don't know what it
[1:23:56] is I don't got a pre a notice
[1:24:00] Satan's never sent me a telegram telling
[1:24:03] me he's going to be there
[1:24:07] if Satan sent me a Telegram and said I'm
[1:24:10] going to be here at such and such time
[1:24:12] how many of you would show up
[1:24:16] you go ahead because I ain't
[1:24:19] you won't find me anywhere near that guy
[1:24:21] if I know it's him
[1:24:25] I have no part of them
[1:24:27] I have no Fellowship I have no
[1:24:30] Fellowship in his ideas I have no
[1:24:32] Fellowship in his thoughts I have no
[1:24:34] Fellowship in his thinking there's
[1:24:37] nothing about him I want to know there's
[1:24:40] nothing about him all I know is He's a
[1:24:43] snail and that's all he is and he's a
[1:24:46] liar he's the father of all lies there's
[1:24:49] no truth in him
[1:24:55] uh I he don't deserve the time of day
[1:25:01] but yet
[1:25:04] he's there
[1:25:07] and anytime anybody ever wants to do
[1:25:10] something for God
[1:25:15] the enemy is always trying to hinder the
[1:25:21] church being built into what it should
[1:25:23] be built
[1:25:25] whether it's giving them a rabbit Trail
[1:25:27] to run down whether it's to give them a
[1:25:30] Doctrine to go running after uh whether
[1:25:32] it's to give up
[1:25:34] a movement to rise up whatever he can do
[1:25:39] and what does he appear as he appears as
[1:25:42] an angel of Light he appears like oh
[1:25:45] this is God and and this is great and
[1:25:48] and this is this and this is that and
[1:25:52] all he's trying to do is pull their eyes
[1:25:55] off of what that your eyes should be set
[1:25:58] on I believe his brother Mike said about
[1:26:00] the eye of God
[1:26:05] of what path is he leading me down
[1:26:08] what works has he foreordained for me to
[1:26:12] walk in what is it to you if he tarries
[1:26:15] till I come follow me whatever he can do
[1:26:19] to to to to shake you or to or or to
[1:26:24] move you and what is he shaking not only
[1:26:27] is he trying to shake your faith
[1:26:29] but he's trying to shake your journey
[1:26:33] your accomplishment
[1:26:39] Peter says it this way in First Peter
[1:26:41] the fourth chapter
[1:26:49] I was going to start with the 12th verse
[1:26:51] but there's so much wisdom in the 11th
[1:26:53] verse
[1:26:55] first Peter 4 11. it says if any man
[1:26:59] speak
[1:27:00] let him speak as the Oracle of God
[1:27:07] If any man minister
[1:27:10] let him do it as the ability which God
[1:27:15] giveth
[1:27:18] Ah that's a great scripture
[1:27:21] too many times people try to imitate
[1:27:24] Ministries
[1:27:26] or results
[1:27:28] you know God's got an ear too
[1:27:32] act you know sometimes we might have
[1:27:34] somebody sing and oh they might not have
[1:27:38] the best tune in the world or the words
[1:27:42] might just not rhyme like uh you you
[1:27:45] know some uh great Shakespeare had
[1:27:49] written them but you don't know what
[1:27:51] music is to God's ear
[1:27:54] you know music that God's yours what
[1:27:56] comes out of the heart
[1:27:58] you get places and all of a sudden you
[1:28:01] know it's all about how good their
[1:28:02] musicians are and who can keep beat and
[1:28:05] if someone can't hit the string just
[1:28:08] right they're out of the group and and
[1:28:10] we've got a great internet presence I
[1:28:12] don't want an internet presence
[1:28:16] you know what I mean I just want us to
[1:28:19] know when he's here
[1:28:20] and when he's here I want us to praise
[1:28:22] His name I want him to worship him I
[1:28:25] want him to have his way okay if you
[1:28:27] want to lift sing and lift your hands up
[1:28:30] the Lord feel free to do it but do it
[1:28:33] for him
[1:28:35] not to create an atmosphere not to
[1:28:38] create a service not to delay anything
[1:28:41] of this world let it let it let your joy
[1:28:44] rise up in the Heavenly places in Christ
[1:28:47] Jesus
[1:28:51] and just
[1:28:54] let the word of God become our our great
[1:28:58] thing and he says and do it to the
[1:29:01] ability
[1:29:03] in order to do it put all your God into
[1:29:07] whatever you do
[1:29:10] I believe Billy Paul shared with us here
[1:29:12] and and me personally
[1:29:15] he told me he said David
[1:29:18] my father told me he said if you be
[1:29:21] you're going to be a bum don't you work
[1:29:24] one day in your life
[1:29:27] what is that what a statement
[1:29:32] be the best
[1:29:34] do it according to your ability
[1:29:37] you know that scripture ought to
[1:29:38] motivate every single one of us to ask
[1:29:40] ourselves what's my ability
[1:29:43] not my ability as I can do this and I
[1:29:46] can do that I'm not talking about a
[1:29:48] perverted side of it of having an ego
[1:29:51] we're talking about God what did you
[1:29:53] give me that I can do
[1:29:56] You Are My Strength Lord I can do this
[1:30:01] and it goes on to say he said
[1:30:04] which God giveth that God in all things
[1:30:07] may be glorified so yeah it ain't
[1:30:10] beautiful let him do it according to the
[1:30:13] ability which God giveth
[1:30:16] that God in all things may be glorified
[1:30:20] through Jesus Christ to whom be praised
[1:30:23] and Dominion forever and ever amen now
[1:30:28] beloved
[1:30:31] think it not strange concerning the
[1:30:34] fiery trials
[1:30:36] which is to try you
[1:30:39] as though some strange thing has
[1:30:43] happened unto you
[1:30:48] that's
[1:30:49] if I could say the
[1:30:53] bottom theme of what
[1:30:55] that we're talking about
[1:30:58] think it not strange that this adversary
[1:31:03] resisting you is a strange thing
[1:31:08] in other words like it shouldn't happen
[1:31:14] it's going to happen
[1:31:18] he says
[1:31:19] but rejoice in so much
[1:31:23] as ye are partakers of Christ's
[1:31:25] suffering that when his glory shall be
[1:31:28] revealed you may be glad
[1:31:32] also with exceedingly Joy if you be
[1:31:36] reproached for the name of Christ happy
[1:31:39] are you
[1:31:40] for the spirit of glory and of God
[1:31:43] resteth upon you
[1:31:47] on their part he is evil spoken of but
[1:31:52] on your part he is
[1:31:54] glorify
[1:31:57] just an amazing statement
[1:32:01] and then you turn over to Thessalonians
[1:32:04] and
[1:32:06] and I think this is a striking scripture
[1:32:09] in Thessalonians 3 and 3.
[1:32:13] it says
[1:32:15] and he's talking about the Affliction
[1:32:18] that he was in and and the trouble that
[1:32:21] he was going through and how they were
[1:32:23] withstanding him and and and and and
[1:32:26] being in prison and all the different
[1:32:28] things that Paul went through and he
[1:32:31] says this in the in the
[1:32:33] third verse
[1:32:35] he says that no man should be moved by
[1:32:39] these afflictions
[1:32:44] for yourselves know that we are
[1:32:48] appointed there unto
[1:32:53] for verily when we were with you we told
[1:32:57] you before that we should suffer
[1:32:59] tribulation even as it came to pass and
[1:33:04] ye no for this cause
[1:33:07] when I could no longer for a bear I sent
[1:33:10] to know your faith let's by some means
[1:33:14] the tempter have tempted you and our
[1:33:18] labor be in vain
[1:33:21] you know it's absolutely appointed
[1:33:25] to the believer
[1:33:28] that the adversary is going to withstand
[1:33:32] you
[1:33:34] every time that you want to get an inch
[1:33:36] with God he's going to be there
[1:33:39] he's going to try to keep you from
[1:33:42] climbing that ladder if he has to he'll
[1:33:45] wave the mirror in front of you
[1:33:48] he'll try to look he'll try to always
[1:33:50] show you what you are
[1:33:53] but a Believer never goes by what they
[1:33:56] are they only go by what's spoken what
[1:34:00] they are to be
[1:34:03] that's what they wrote her yeah I'm like
[1:34:06] this
[1:34:07] but it's not I don't want to be like
[1:34:09] this and he promised me I'm not going to
[1:34:11] remain like this
[1:34:15] so I don't care that's not what I'm
[1:34:17] seeing as I spoke many years ago that's
[1:34:20] not the real me
[1:34:24] we're going forward
[1:34:26] we're marching
[1:34:28] we're going to have to fight all the way
[1:34:31] through
[1:34:32] and he's got to step up his game Satan
[1:34:35] does he's got to stop you
[1:34:39] he can't let you bear arms
[1:34:43] he wants to feed you ammunition that
[1:34:46] don't work
[1:34:47] he wants to join in your fight and give
[1:34:50] you blanks and give you dummies and give
[1:34:54] you programs and things that that don't
[1:34:56] work there's only one weapon that works
[1:35:00] it's by these great and precious
[1:35:03] promises that we are partakers of divine
[1:35:07] nature it's when you can take a promise
[1:35:10] of God and you can hold that promise of
[1:35:12] God up here and say I don't care what
[1:35:15] you do this is what's going to come to
[1:35:18] pass
[1:35:20] because it's a promise
[1:35:22] from the promissor
[1:35:24] that cannot lie
[1:35:30] you know when he starts saying well what
[1:35:32] about this and what about that and what
[1:35:34] about this
[1:35:37] symptoms
[1:35:42] isn't the Cure
[1:35:49] you could get rid of all the symptoms
[1:35:51] and still be sick
[1:35:55] I know some of us have had that covet
[1:35:57] thing that went around I know a person
[1:36:00] that had seven vaccines
[1:36:03] you know why they've had seven vaccines
[1:36:05] they've took they've had covet seven
[1:36:08] times
[1:36:11] it's according to your faith
[1:36:15] whether you take it or whether you don't
[1:36:18] I don't trust any of it
[1:36:21] it's only one thing I know is real
[1:36:24] this is real
[1:36:27] and I know if I believe this
[1:36:31] despite my weaknesses despite my
[1:36:35] failures despite the number of times
[1:36:37] that I fail there's one thing God can't
[1:36:40] do and that's lie
[1:36:43] and the minute I can approach him and
[1:36:46] say Lord you said so because I I I it
[1:36:50] didn't say if I was this and it didn't
[1:36:53] say if I was that it says one thing if I
[1:36:56] would confess my sins that you'd be
[1:36:59] faithful and just to forgive them if I
[1:37:02] would let you know that I failed here
[1:37:03] and I've done this and I'm sorry I've
[1:37:06] done that you would throw those in the
[1:37:08] sea of your God's forgetfulness he told
[1:37:10] me that then I could approach your
[1:37:12] throne
[1:37:14] under the shed blood and I could have
[1:37:17] what I asked for
[1:37:19] and that's the church
[1:37:23] that God wants to start rising up
[1:37:27] he wants people to start looking at this
[1:37:30] enemy and said it's appointed to me
[1:37:33] Satan that you would come
[1:37:37] I knew you would be here
[1:37:44] I believe if we read the scripture I may
[1:37:47] have read it I'll read it again
[1:37:49] again found in in
[1:37:53] Peter
[1:37:55] and and this is the fifth chapter
[1:37:58] and as we get ready for communion
[1:38:04] the fifth
[1:38:07] verse of the fifth chapter of Peter I
[1:38:10] think maybe it was read this morning I'm
[1:38:11] not sure likewise you're younger submit
[1:38:13] yourselves unto the elders
[1:38:15] yea of all ye be subject one to another
[1:38:19] and be clothed with humility for God
[1:38:23] resisteth the proud and give Grace unto
[1:38:28] thee humble oh do you see that doorway
[1:38:32] of humility
[1:38:35] amen you know
[1:38:42] it it don't matter when you start if you
[1:38:45] start to measure Yourself by money
[1:38:47] there's already somebody that's got more
[1:38:50] money
[1:38:53] I don't measure Myself by money I
[1:38:55] measure Myself by my inheritance
[1:39:01] my father
[1:39:02] owns the cattle
[1:39:04] on a thousand Hill
[1:39:08] the Shah of Iran at one time was one of
[1:39:11] the richest men of the world
[1:39:13] he had a
[1:39:15] 747 I believe it was back then and it
[1:39:19] was nothing but a hospital
[1:39:22] it had a full team of Surgeons it had a
[1:39:26] full nursing staff it had every drug and
[1:39:30] everything it followed him all around
[1:39:33] wherever he went
[1:39:38] didn't matter how many doctors he had
[1:39:42] because our messenger told us he said if
[1:39:46] God's going to take you
[1:39:49] there's not enough doctors there's not
[1:39:52] enough medicine and anything to keep you
[1:39:54] here
[1:39:55] but if God wants you to stay here
[1:39:58] there's not enough devils and there's
[1:40:00] not enough sickness and there's not
[1:40:02] enough anything that that he can take
[1:40:05] you
[1:40:09] and that that could you we there's no
[1:40:12] need us putting our rest in anything
[1:40:13] anymore
[1:40:16] I mean how much more news do we need to
[1:40:19] understand this world is falling apart
[1:40:24] that we've got to move our affections
[1:40:27] away from the things of the world
[1:40:30] and start turning back to the promises
[1:40:34] that God's given us to survive by
[1:40:38] we're only going to survive by the
[1:40:41] promises of God's word
[1:40:47] you know it's going to keep you
[1:40:50] from here on out
[1:40:52] the supernatural
[1:40:55] because you don't fit
[1:41:04] there's all kinds of things in the news
[1:41:06] of them coming after the Catholic Church
[1:41:13] wait till they find out what we believe
[1:41:18] what do you think they're doing
[1:41:20] they're trying to create hate crime
[1:41:22] well you got to have a crime against
[1:41:24] somebody
[1:41:28] right
[1:41:30] well animals got more rights than a lot
[1:41:32] of humans
[1:41:35] not against dogs or cats or
[1:41:38] rats
[1:41:40] I'm we'd be surprised pretty soon if
[1:41:42] there's a organization to save the New
[1:41:44] York rat
[1:41:49] oh you laugh
[1:41:55] I remember when they're sitting on a
[1:41:57] plane I was sitting there and I said you
[1:41:58] know something one day they're going to
[1:42:00] make a book about walking
[1:42:05] I thought that that's hilarious you know
[1:42:07] I just laughed as I was walking yeah
[1:42:10] now we watch you'll write a book about
[1:42:12] walking now you've got walking shoes
[1:42:14] walking books walking trails
[1:42:21] you know
[1:42:22] take a walk
[1:42:25] walk walk walk
[1:42:28] you know and
[1:42:31] you can go on and on it doesn't matter
[1:42:36] see there's there's nothing left
[1:42:40] they're forming this great thing oh you
[1:42:42] know it's against this faith and against
[1:42:43] this you know where that's all leading
[1:42:45] to it's all leading to it's all leading
[1:42:48] to okay let's let's identify the with
[1:42:52] religions are those that can have hate
[1:42:56] crimes against you got to declare
[1:42:58] yourself before there's a hate crime oh
[1:43:02] they're going to gather up and say these
[1:43:04] are all the Christians and these are all
[1:43:05] the groups and and everybody's going to
[1:43:08] apply for all this and under a great big
[1:43:11] disguise as an angel of Light
[1:43:15] like they're wanting to join themselves
[1:43:17] to us in some great form of Christianity
[1:43:21] let us join you and help promote your
[1:43:25] God we have nothing to do with them we
[1:43:29] are not going to rely on them we are not
[1:43:31] going to trust them we are going to lay
[1:43:33] our faith in one thing and that's God's
[1:43:36] word that's the promises of God's word
[1:43:38] that's the supernatural God that
[1:43:41] promised us that he would take care of
[1:43:43] us
[1:43:47] and when it gets too bad he'll take us
[1:43:49] out
[1:43:53] but don't think it's strange
[1:43:56] that we have an adversary
[1:44:00] don't think it's strange that Satan's
[1:44:02] gonna fight you
[1:44:03] on every level
[1:44:06] the only thing is strange he's going to
[1:44:08] play games in your mind
[1:44:11] don't think it's strange that he's going
[1:44:13] to try to take all your hope away
[1:44:15] don't think it's stranger he's going to
[1:44:17] try to make the situation look
[1:44:19] impossible
[1:44:23] all things
[1:44:25] are possible
[1:44:27] and I can do all things through Christ
[1:44:31] Jesus who strengthened me
[1:44:37] the church
[1:44:39] of the Living God is being called back
[1:44:44] to return to the supernatural
[1:44:48] not in the disguise
[1:44:55] of any
[1:44:57] movement or worship or anything but in
[1:45:02] the individual Soldier
[1:45:08] meeting Satan
[1:45:12] his adversary
[1:45:15] and and did I ever finish reading that
[1:45:18] scripture
[1:45:20] I don't know if I did
[1:45:22] let me read it again
[1:45:25] before I close
[1:45:30] because it's a it's a great
[1:45:33] scripture
[1:45:36] it says
[1:45:38] humble yourself that he may exalt you in
[1:45:40] due time casting all your cares upon Him
[1:45:44] for he careth for you
[1:45:47] this is the hour of the church
[1:45:53] where she comes to the place that the
[1:45:56] world no longer has anything to offer
[1:45:59] her
[1:46:01] there's nothing that she's offering that
[1:46:05] you want to be a part of
[1:46:10] why do we work to redeem the time to
[1:46:14] redeem the days
[1:46:16] why do we work because if we stole that
[1:46:19] we can give
[1:46:23] why are we doing what we're doing we're
[1:46:25] we're waiting out the time
[1:46:29] because we're looking up
[1:46:31] for our Redemption draweth nigh
[1:46:35] we're we've we've been cast out
[1:46:42] they don't want you
[1:46:47] don't want to get back in
[1:46:50] thank God they
[1:46:56] he said this
[1:46:58] cast your cares upon Him for he careth
[1:47:00] for you be sober
[1:47:03] be vigilant
[1:47:05] because your adversary the devil
[1:47:08] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[1:47:13] whom he made devour
[1:47:16] I think Peter was well acquainted with
[1:47:18] the Devil
[1:47:22] he was well acquainted with them
[1:47:26] we don't have to like them
[1:47:29] we don't give him no glory
[1:47:32] we don't listen to him
[1:47:36] but when he came to Jesus
[1:47:39] Jesus said get behind me
[1:47:43] get behind me
[1:47:46] because it is
[1:47:48] written
[1:47:52] a body that's fitted and joined together
[1:47:56] with every member
[1:47:59] supplying the need
[1:48:01] to the other
[1:48:04] if I could say it like this
[1:48:06] every member
[1:48:10] is standing at his gate
[1:48:13] and he's not going to let Satan enter
[1:48:16] into the body through his his portal
[1:48:24] Jesus said he Sanctified himself
[1:48:27] for our sake
[1:48:31] it's it's when we understand that wait a
[1:48:34] minute I I cannot let this worry
[1:48:37] overtake me
[1:48:39] because if I let this worry overtake me
[1:48:43] then it if I'm not careful it'll
[1:48:47] overtake another
[1:48:50] and another
[1:48:52] you say give me word A little leaven
[1:48:55] leaveneth the whole lump
[1:48:58] it's when we start standing up
[1:49:01] we don't stand up against people
[1:49:06] we resist our adversary
[1:49:09] when he draws a painting no matter how
[1:49:11] realistic he looks
[1:49:13] if it don't line up with this
[1:49:17] amen it's Modern Art
[1:49:22] it ain't real
[1:49:24] you've got to look through it
[1:49:27] until you see the revelation of God's
[1:49:29] word standing in it
[1:49:31] every deceit of Satan has got God's word
[1:49:35] standing in it
[1:49:39] Every Lie of Satan's got God's true word
[1:49:43] in it
[1:49:45] and it's such a call now Church
[1:49:49] for us to return back
[1:49:52] and be restored
[1:49:55] to the faith
[1:49:57] of our fathers
[1:50:00] to the battle that they fought
[1:50:03] they all long to be here
[1:50:07] to be in your spot young women
[1:50:10] every sister in that church would love
[1:50:13] to be here today to stand against the
[1:50:17] Wows of the devil that's trying to turn
[1:50:19] you into something that you're not
[1:50:23] to get you to give away your virtue
[1:50:26] your motherhood your sanctity
[1:50:31] young men the same thing all them guys
[1:50:35] would want to be there so they could
[1:50:37] turn their head that church was crying
[1:50:39] out let me stand in this age
[1:50:42] but God chose you
[1:50:45] and he gave you a weapon
[1:50:47] and he gave you his Spirit to fight with
[1:50:55] he gave you himself
[1:50:58] and he just says to the church the hold
[1:51:02] I stand at the door and knock
[1:51:08] behold I stand the door and knock
[1:51:12] if you will open up
[1:51:15] I'll come in and sup with you
[1:51:19] that that's not a history book story
[1:51:22] you are the door
[1:51:25] we're the door
[1:51:28] that he's knocking what's he trying to
[1:51:31] do
[1:51:32] prophet of God said he's trying to get
[1:51:34] back in his church
[1:51:39] why does he want to get back in his
[1:51:41] church because he wants to throw that
[1:51:45] devil into the Lake of Fire
[1:51:50] and you're his army
[1:51:52] you're his Soldier
[1:51:54] he wants you to start putting the
[1:51:56] bullets
[1:51:58] in your gun
[1:52:00] and start pulling
[1:52:03] the trigger
[1:52:06] and fighting
[1:52:10] a member of the prophet of God preaching
[1:52:12] he goes back a man that was there told
[1:52:15] me
[1:52:16] he said brother ma'am stepped back from
[1:52:19] the pulpit
[1:52:20] and he looked you know how he would get
[1:52:22] in that realm where he just seemed to
[1:52:24] take that stagger step so under the
[1:52:27] anointing Soul looking out there and he
[1:52:29] said he reached down like he drew his
[1:52:31] sword and said who will take their sword
[1:52:33] and Stand By Me
[1:52:38] I want to draw My Sword I want to get
[1:52:40] back in the fight
[1:52:42] I want to get back on the battlefield
[1:52:45] I'm not going to go hunt him but Betty
[1:52:48] when he comes
[1:52:50] I'm going to be ready
[1:52:52] the trial in one hand and my sword and
[1:52:55] the other God bless you and I'm going to
[1:52:57] ask brother Billy to come and read the
[1:52:59] communion scriptures for us before we
[1:53:02] pray brother Billy would you come thank
[1:53:04] you
[1:53:05] the ability reads the scripture
[1:54:00] it says for I have received of the Lord
[1:54:02] of First Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:54:06] the 23rd verse for I have received of
[1:54:09] the Lord that which I have also
[1:54:10] delivered unto you
[1:54:12] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:54:14] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:54:17] and when he had given thanks
[1:54:20] he'd break it and he said take eat this
[1:54:24] is my body which is broken for you
[1:54:27] do this in remembrance of me and after
[1:54:31] the same manner he took the cup when he
[1:54:34] had stopped saying this is it says this
[1:54:37] cup is the New Testament in my blood do
[1:54:40] the do do do this do ye as often as ye
[1:54:45] drink it in remembrance of me
[1:54:48] for as often as often as ye eat
[1:54:51] eat ye eat of this bread and drink the
[1:54:54] cut this cup you do this
[1:54:57] you do show the Lord's death till I come
[1:55:01] wherefore whatsoever shall eat
[1:55:05] and this bread and drink this cup
[1:55:08] unworthily
[1:55:10] of the Lord and Wordly shall be guilty
[1:55:13] of the blood of the body and the blood
[1:55:15] of the Lord but let a man examine
[1:55:18] himself so let him eat of that bread and
[1:55:21] drink of that cup
[1:55:25] and drinketh unworldly eat it and drink
[1:55:28] a damnation to himself not Discerning
[1:55:31] the Lord's body
[1:55:32] for this cause many are weak and and
[1:55:36] secretly among you and many sleep for if
[1:55:40] we would judge ourselves
[1:55:43] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:55:46] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[1:55:49] we should not be condemned with the
[1:55:52] world
[1:55:52] wherefore my brethren when we when ye
[1:55:56] come together to eat Terry one for
[1:55:59] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:56:02] eat at home
[1:56:04] that ye come not together unto
[1:56:08] condemnation and the rest will I said in
[1:56:10] order when I come
[1:56:17] foreign
