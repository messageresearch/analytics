[22:30] good morning welcome to you
[22:32] are you delighted to be in the house of
[22:34] the lord this morning
[22:35] and then we're going to concentrate a
[22:37] little bit on that
[22:38] that word delight
[22:40] i think it appears
[22:42] i'm 15 16 18 times or so in the bible
[22:44] it's delight
[22:46] uh
[22:47] and the
[22:49] dictionary says it's to take or to have
[22:52] great pleasure in
[22:54] or with
[22:56] so uh we we pray the lord will have
[22:58] delight in his
[22:59] in his congregation this morning maybe
[23:01] we have a little more elbow room this
[23:02] morning we can spread our spiritual
[23:04] wings and
[23:05] and set our wings and fly in the wings
[23:07] of faith amen amen
[23:10] david doesn't take very long to uh
[23:13] to to use that word delight
[23:16] uh the first chapter of psalms he said
[23:18] blessed is a man that walking not on the
[23:20] council of the ungodly nor stand it in
[23:22] the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[23:24] seat of the scorple but his delight
[23:27] is in the law of the lord and in his law
[23:29] that they meditate day and night
[23:31] that's where i want to find myself this
[23:33] morning we're actually going to read
[23:34] from psalm 37
[23:37] it is a
[23:39] it's a full
[23:41] song
[23:45] and it's rather lengthy
[23:47] so if you don't mind i'll read it and
[23:48] people just follow along but
[23:50] uh
[23:51] i was talking to my dad this week and he
[23:53] said
[23:54] and i asked him how he was doing what
[23:56] was going on he said well son said i'm
[23:58] studying the message
[24:01] and he said you know this is this
[24:02] message
[24:03] is concentrated
[24:05] he said we've got concentrated juice
[24:08] concentrated soap but this message is
[24:10] concentrated
[24:13] i appreciated that because a little bit
[24:15] can go a long
[24:16] ways and before we read this song
[24:20] i'm not excuse me i'm not trying to have
[24:23] a mini sermonette or anything but
[24:25] just to highlight
[24:28] the beauty of holiness and keeping the
[24:30] sabbath
[24:31] you don't have to turn to it if i want
[24:32] to read a portion of isaiah
[24:35] 56 brothers can flash it they'd like
[24:39] said thus saith the lord keep ye
[24:41] judgment or equity
[24:43] and do justice for my salvation is near
[24:46] to come
[24:47] and my righteousness to be revealed
[24:50] blessed is the man that doeth this and
[24:53] the son of man that layeth hold on it
[24:56] that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
[24:58] it and keepeth
[25:00] his hand from doing any evil
[25:03] and then in 58 13
[25:06] isaiah
[25:07] if thou turn away thy foot from the
[25:09] sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my
[25:12] holy day and call the sabbath a delight
[25:16] the holy of the lord honorable and shalt
[25:19] honor him not doing thine own ways nor
[25:22] finding thine own pleasure
[25:23] nor seeking thine own words
[25:26] not even using your own words then shalt
[25:28] now delight thyself in the lord
[25:31] and i will cause thee to ride upon the
[25:33] high places of the earth and feed thee
[25:36] with the heritage of jacob thy father
[25:38] for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it
[25:41] amen blessed be the name of the lord we
[25:43] can delight in his presence we can lift
[25:45] up our hands and thank the lord
[25:48] and then when we go our separate ways
[25:50] from here
[25:51] that sustains us for the journey amen
[25:53] and brother brown typed the preaching of
[25:56] the word to the waters of separation
[25:59] you know when the red heifer was taken
[26:01] without the camp we know the
[26:02] purification and exodus he taught is
[26:04] that it had to be burned entirely and
[26:06] the priest eliezer would dip his finger
[26:07] in the blood and sprinkle the tabernacle
[26:10] seven times he typed that to seven ages
[26:13] but the water
[26:14] of separation
[26:16] determined the clean from the unclean
[26:18] you had to be washed by that and that's
[26:19] what the preaching of the word does when
[26:21] brother david comes out it's not his own
[26:23] thoughts he's preaching but it comes
[26:25] from the word of god and it it shows us
[26:27] where we need to make ourselves right
[26:29] and to make ourselves clean by the word
[26:31] of god amen psalm 37
[26:34] as i said i'll read it and we'll try to
[26:36] get through this it's 40 verses here and
[26:39] fret not thyself because of evil doers
[26:42] neither be thou envious against the
[26:44] workers of iniquity there's no need to
[26:46] end in this world
[26:47] for they shall soon be cut down like the
[26:49] grass and wither as the greener
[26:51] trust in the lord and do good so shalt
[26:54] thou dwell in the land and barely thou
[26:55] shalt be fed amen delight thyself also
[26:59] in the lord and he shall give thee the
[27:01] desires of thine heart
[27:03] verse three said trust in the lord and
[27:05] do good verse 4 he said delight thyself
[27:08] also in the lord amen i just want to add
[27:11] here you know there's something too
[27:13] saying hey
[27:16] i accept that because that word of the
[27:18] lord applies to me but when you delight
[27:20] in it then you really wrap your arms
[27:22] around and embrace it it's like having a
[27:24] good meal
[27:25] and thinking hey
[27:28] i'm hungry i'm going to eat this meal
[27:30] because it needs i need substances from
[27:32] it
[27:33] but if you get some
[27:34] dish that you really do love then you
[27:36] step up and you really heartily enjoy
[27:39] maybe sister nikki's
[27:42] macaroni cheese for instance you think
[27:44] oh i love that macaroni and cheese then
[27:46] you're really delight in it that's the
[27:48] way i want to be with the word of the
[27:49] lord amen amen
[27:53] commit thy way unto the lord trust also
[27:55] in him and he shall bring it to pass
[27:58] and he shall bring forth thy
[27:59] righteousness as the light and thy
[28:01] judgment as the new day
[28:03] rest in the lord and wait patiently for
[28:05] him fret not thyself because of him who
[28:07] prospereth in his way because of the man
[28:10] who bringeth wicked devices to pass
[28:12] cease from anger and forsake wrath
[28:14] threaten not thyself in any wise to do
[28:16] evil for evildoers shall be cut off but
[28:19] those that wait upon the lord they shall
[28:21] inherit the earth
[28:22] for yet a little while and the wicked
[28:24] shall not be ye they shall diligently
[28:27] consider his place and it shall not be
[28:30] but the meek shall inherit the earth and
[28:32] shall delight
[28:33] delight themselves in the abundance of
[28:35] peace and what a delight the wicked
[28:38] plotteth against the just and gnasheth
[28:40] upon him with his teeth the lord shall
[28:42] laugh at him for he seeth that his day
[28:44] is coming the wicked have drawn out the
[28:46] sword and had bent their bow to cast
[28:47] down the poor needy and to slay such as
[28:50] be of upright conversation
[28:52] you can't even hold a good conversation
[28:54] in their presence without them beating
[28:55] you up
[28:56] their sword shall enter into their own
[28:57] heart and their bow shall be broken a
[29:00] little that a righteous man hath is
[29:01] better than the riches of many wicked
[29:03] for the arms of the wicked shall be
[29:05] broken but the lord upholdeth the
[29:06] righteous the lord knoweth the days of
[29:08] the upright and their inheritance shall
[29:10] be forever they shall not be ashamed in
[29:13] the evil time and in the days of famine
[29:15] they shall be satisfied but the wicked
[29:18] shall perish and the enemies of the lord
[29:19] shall be as a fat of lambs they shall
[29:21] consume into smoke shall they consume
[29:23] away the wicked bar with him path not
[29:26] again but the righteous showeth mercy
[29:28] and giveth for such as be blessed of him
[29:30] shall inherit the earth and they that be
[29:32] cursed of him shall be cut off the steps
[29:35] of a good man are ordered by the lord
[29:37] and he delighteth in his way
[29:40] though he fall he shall be not be
[29:42] utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth
[29:44] him with his hand
[29:46] here's one that applies to me i have
[29:48] been young
[29:49] and now i'm old yet have i not seen the
[29:52] righteous forsaken nor his seed begging
[29:54] bread
[29:54] he is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[29:57] seed is blessed depart from evil and do
[29:59] good and dwell forevermore for the lord
[30:02] loveth judgment and forsaken not his
[30:04] saints they are preserved forever but
[30:06] the seed of the wicked shall be cut off
[30:09] the righteous shall inherit the land and
[30:11] dwell therein forever
[30:13] the mouth of the righteous speaketh
[30:14] wisdom and his tongue talketh of
[30:16] judgment the law of his god is in his
[30:19] heart none of his steps shall slide the
[30:21] wicked watcheth the righteous and
[30:23] seeketh to slay him
[30:25] the lord will not leave him in his hand
[30:26] nor condemn him when he is judged
[30:29] wait on the lord and keep his way and he
[30:31] shall exalt thee to inherit the land
[30:33] when the wicked are cut off then thou
[30:35] shalt see it
[30:36] i have seen the wicked in great power
[30:38] and spreading himself like a green bay
[30:40] tree
[30:41] yet he passed away in low he was not yea
[30:44] i sought him that he could not be found
[30:47] mark the perfect man and behold the
[30:49] upright for the end of that man is peace
[30:52] but the transgressor shall be destroyed
[30:54] together the end of the wicked shall be
[30:56] cut off
[30:57] but the salvation of the righteous is of
[30:59] the lord
[31:00] he is their strength in the time of
[31:01] trouble
[31:03] and the lord shall help them and deliver
[31:05] them he shall deliver them from the
[31:07] wicked and save them because they trust
[31:09] in him amen blessed be the name of the
[31:11] lord i'll leave one more scripture with
[31:13] you hebrews 9 28

[31:17] so christ was once offered for the sins

[56:10] perfectly according to your plan
[56:13] we just ask you to
[56:14] bless us this morning in this time of
[56:17] fellowship it's cold outside lord rainy
[56:20] and dreary but
[56:22] in our hearts we know there's a greater
[56:24] day
[56:25] coming we ask you to be with us today in
[56:28] jesus precious name we pray
[56:31] amen
[56:33] amen god bless you may be seated
[56:36] i don't have my um
[56:40] my gun so hey gary
[56:43] could you go get my mic and i'll put it
[56:45] on i forgot to put it on this morning in
[56:48] case i get
[56:49] going different places
[56:51] which i wanted i'm not
[56:53] no baby dedication right so i guess you
[56:56] guys are free to go
[56:59] they look at me like i'm gonna sing
[57:02] all right
[57:03] i ought to do it one day
[57:05] and then um
[57:07] they'll they'll flee off the platform
[57:10] amen a lot of
[57:12] a lot of people out there's the
[57:15] sickness uh
[57:17] uh
[57:17] going around quite a bit uh
[57:20] i guess it's another
[57:23] form of covet and
[57:25] and you know i like
[57:27] information that
[57:28] uh so
[57:30] everybody's got a different story
[57:32] what's going on and
[57:34] and uh so now they think and i don't
[57:38] know who they is
[57:40] but they think
[57:41] that
[57:42] all the people that are
[57:45] getting this new covet have been
[57:46] vaccinated because it's the vaccine
[57:49] that's given them
[57:51] the new the new strain so
[57:57] yeah just pin that on there
[58:00] we don't care
[58:06] how does this thing work
[58:23] that better
[58:24] all right now i can hear myself
[58:26] but anyway so we don't know what's doing
[58:29] it but i got one thing all sicknesses of
[58:32] the devil so
[58:33] that's we know and we know where we're
[58:35] going
[58:36] there won't be any sickness there
[58:39] whatsoever amen so let's just have a
[58:41] good time in the word this morning
[58:44] amen and fellowship around the things
[58:46] that
[58:47] god has for us and and we just have a
[58:50] little simple thought
[58:52] but but i i think that
[58:57] that god's revealed in simplicity
[59:00] and the more complicated that
[59:03] god can
[59:04] satan can make things
[59:07] the less
[59:09] we narrow our perspective
[59:12] on where we find them
[59:15] i remember aaron preached a sermon one
[59:17] time i really
[59:19] enjoyed it was about choices
[59:22] and i think he brought out in that
[59:25] message that there's like 47 different
[59:28] choices of water
[59:31] so
[59:32] in fact they even got water now that's
[59:34] smart
[59:37] now if anybody can scientifically
[59:39] explain to me how water's smart
[59:43] i i'd like to learn that amen but
[59:47] but we want to just fellowship this
[59:49] morning have a good time in the lord and
[59:52] and
[59:53] and
[59:54] just kind of
[59:56] uh stir up our remembrance and
[59:58] and uh of you know what it is
[1:00:03] that we stand for and and what's the
[1:00:07] motivating principles that drive us
[1:00:10] a a person that used to fellowship here
[1:00:13] not long ago told one of our
[1:00:16] our members they were fellowshipping
[1:00:18] with them and they said well i can't
[1:00:20] believe the message
[1:00:22] anymore
[1:00:23] and i thought that's good but then what
[1:00:26] is it that you do believe
[1:00:30] okay if you don't believe this that's
[1:00:32] fine i can
[1:00:35] i'm all for that if you don't believe it
[1:00:38] you don't believe it but the question is
[1:00:40] what is it then
[1:00:42] that you do believe
[1:00:45] and so i don't even think people ask
[1:00:47] themselves what they believe
[1:00:50] or or they don't even
[1:00:52] question
[1:00:55] that what they believe is affecting
[1:00:57] their decisions
[1:00:59] and the path that they take
[1:01:02] now if i believe there was no
[1:01:04] uh life after
[1:01:07] even the scriptures tells me if we don't
[1:01:10] have any hope of eternity we of most men
[1:01:14] are all miserable
[1:01:15] i mean we're trying to live right and
[1:01:17] sustain from the world and
[1:01:20] and not you know try to do good and if
[1:01:24] there's no reward
[1:01:26] well
[1:01:27] let's uh
[1:01:28] let's live roudius and
[1:01:31] and
[1:01:32] every uh
[1:01:33] way possible because it's when it's over
[1:01:36] it's over and but i don't live for this
[1:01:40] world
[1:01:41] amen we believe and there's a world to
[1:01:43] come
[1:01:44] and and then the next question
[1:01:47] would have been is that if what you
[1:01:49] believe if you believe in life after
[1:01:52] then how do you get there
[1:01:55] how do you get there and and
[1:01:58] that kind of brings us to our topic this
[1:02:00] morning
[1:02:01] and and
[1:02:03] if i had a title for this and and we'll
[1:02:06] just kind of fellowship along these
[1:02:08] lines the word is the key
[1:02:12] to the supernatural
[1:02:14] the word is the key to the supernatural
[1:02:18] and of course that's uh
[1:02:21] that's the way an old person talks a key
[1:02:24] nowadays they would use the word
[1:02:26] password
[1:02:28] you know what i mean because nobody uses
[1:02:30] a key
[1:02:31] anymore it's what's your code what's
[1:02:33] your password you know that you don't
[1:02:36] even go to the lock now you just walk up
[1:02:38] to the lock and you press buttons and it
[1:02:40] opens up
[1:02:41] that's if you're old-fashioned if you're
[1:02:44] modern you reach and grab your phone
[1:02:47] and press it and the key
[1:02:49] would open but so what we want to talk
[1:02:52] about this morning is that the word is
[1:02:54] the key
[1:02:56] to the supernatural so let's go ahead
[1:02:58] and open our bibles and stand and we'll
[1:03:01] read three portions of scriptures
[1:03:03] this morning
[1:03:05] and we'll just
[1:03:10] fellowship around the word so let's read
[1:03:12] in genesis 1
[1:03:14] 1.
[1:03:21] now this is the
[1:03:24] there's a very many people
[1:03:27] in the world today that
[1:03:29] does not believe this very first
[1:03:32] statement
[1:03:37] they believe that
[1:03:38] for some
[1:03:40] reason some molecules or some
[1:03:43] planets or something bumped into one
[1:03:46] another or
[1:03:47] or
[1:03:48] something happened in the space that
[1:03:53] just caused things to develop
[1:03:55] in form so that would be a question is
[1:03:58] that what you believe but what i believe
[1:04:01] this morning and i believe you're here
[1:04:03] fellowshipping this morning because you
[1:04:05] believe the same thing
[1:04:08] that in the beginning god created
[1:04:14] heaven
[1:04:15] and the earth
[1:04:17] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:04:21] and the earth
[1:04:22] and the earth was without form and void
[1:04:27] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:04:30] and the spirit of god
[1:04:33] moved
[1:04:34] upon
[1:04:35] the face
[1:04:37] of
[1:04:38] the waters
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] and i'd like to
[1:04:42] let this portion of that
[1:04:45] uh thought set with you and the spirit
[1:04:48] of god moved
[1:04:51] upon the face
[1:04:53] of the waters so we see that if god ever
[1:04:56] does something he always does it the
[1:04:58] same
[1:04:59] so we know that when god
[1:05:02] wants to do something his spirit
[1:05:06] moves upon it god moves by his spirit
[1:05:11] amen and then we'd like to
[1:05:13] also
[1:05:14] turn over
[1:05:16] into
[1:05:17] the gospel
[1:05:18] of saint john and read in the first
[1:05:23] verse here this morning
[1:05:26] of the gospel of saint john
[1:05:31] in the first chapter in the first verse
[1:05:35] in the beginning was the word
[1:05:38] and the word was with god
[1:05:42] and the word was god
[1:05:46] and the same in the beginning
[1:05:49] and the same was in the beginning with
[1:05:52] god
[1:05:53] all things were made by him
[1:05:57] and without him
[1:05:59] was not anything made
[1:06:02] that was made
[1:06:05] so a lot of people
[1:06:07] go through quite a well let's pray our
[1:06:10] gracious father we ask you to bless your
[1:06:13] word to us in your precious name we pray
[1:06:16] amen god bless you may be seated
[1:06:22] so we see that even john is telling us
[1:06:25] here that god created all things
[1:06:29] and there's nothing that was made
[1:06:34] all things were made by him
[1:06:37] and without him was not anything made
[1:06:41] that was made
[1:06:44] so god is the creator
[1:06:46] of all things
[1:06:48] and so as we look at this this morning
[1:06:52] and and
[1:06:53] what we're
[1:06:55] uh pointing to is the word is the key
[1:07:00] or when you think of a key
[1:07:03] you think of something that allows you
[1:07:06] to enter in to some place
[1:07:09] so you've got to have a key to the door
[1:07:12] in other words how are how how are you
[1:07:14] going to get in
[1:07:16] uh
[1:07:16] uh you you have a key to your truck you
[1:07:19] have a key to this or some sort of key
[1:07:23] uh
[1:07:24] key nowadays doesn't necessarily have to
[1:07:26] be a piece of hard steel you know
[1:07:30] there's it's it's the method
[1:07:33] by which you enter into something we
[1:07:37] have what we call key cards i believe
[1:07:40] that you swipe them we have voice
[1:07:42] identity now for keys they they have eye
[1:07:47] identity where you put your eyeball on
[1:07:49] it and and it reads your eye all those
[1:07:53] are methods
[1:07:54] by which that you enter in to a certain
[1:07:58] place
[1:07:59] and so we realize that to enter into the
[1:08:03] supernatural there's got to be a key
[1:08:06] that allows you to go in to
[1:08:10] the supernatural
[1:08:13] and so we we want to place in our minds
[1:08:16] this morning if we could draw and divide
[1:08:19] that over here is the
[1:08:21] supernatural
[1:08:23] this is a supernatural it's a realm
[1:08:26] it's a world
[1:08:28] it's an existence it's a place
[1:08:32] because just like if you would like to
[1:08:34] go to a certain place
[1:08:37] there's a way to get there it might be
[1:08:39] by boat it might be by plane
[1:08:42] it might be by submarine or some method
[1:08:46] by but that's the method by which you
[1:08:49] arrive at that place and so so the
[1:08:53] supernatural is something that exists
[1:08:57] it's real
[1:08:58] it gets it's not uh
[1:09:01] what we would ca
[1:09:03] we would say that it's not something
[1:09:06] that's carnal
[1:09:07] or something that's man-made
[1:09:10] it's not something that
[1:09:12] has been put together
[1:09:14] but it's something that is above nature
[1:09:18] it's supernatural
[1:09:21] so we realized that in the beginning god
[1:09:25] created the supernatural
[1:09:28] because everything that was made by him
[1:09:32] everything that was made the anything
[1:09:35] that was made that was made was made by
[1:09:38] him so everything in our existence comes
[1:09:42] from the supernatural
[1:09:45] so in other words there's another
[1:09:47] governing force
[1:09:49] there's a power
[1:09:51] that runs things so along with what we
[1:09:54] would call
[1:09:56] the world or something that is natural
[1:09:59] there's something that is supernatural
[1:10:02] something that is above
[1:10:05] nature so we understand that there's a
[1:10:08] supernatural realm there there's a
[1:10:10] supernatural existence there's a
[1:10:13] supernatural place
[1:10:15] and we we realized that the
[1:10:18] the supernatural has always been there
[1:10:24] the supernatural was there before there
[1:10:28] was anything natural in the beginning
[1:10:31] was god
[1:10:32] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:10:35] word was with god in the beginning was
[1:10:38] the supernatural
[1:10:39] and the supernatural was god that's what
[1:10:42] existed in the beginning it it's
[1:10:45] absolutely it's always been there
[1:10:51] and it's always been and it's always
[1:10:54] been the same
[1:10:56] it's unchanged
[1:10:58] uh
[1:10:59] it remains the same
[1:11:01] because the word of god is eternal
[1:11:06] so we understand that that if if you
[1:11:09] have to get into the supernatural realm
[1:11:13] this supernatural place so that's
[1:11:16] important for us we'd like to we'd like
[1:11:19] to know there's a supernatural
[1:11:22] because we come into circumstances where
[1:11:25] there's nothing natural that can help us
[1:11:30] we've ran out of all the herbs we've ran
[1:11:33] out of all the formulas we ran out of
[1:11:36] everything that that we can come up with
[1:11:40] and and when we've come to our end when
[1:11:43] we've come to our failure when we've
[1:11:46] come to our wits end and we just don't
[1:11:48] have no place to turn there is a place
[1:11:52] that is supernatural
[1:11:56] and the powers of
[1:11:59] god take my coat off
[1:12:01] thanks billy
[1:12:03] the powers of the supernatural
[1:12:06] are
[1:12:07] identified to us
[1:12:09] because it's the supernatural that
[1:12:12] created the heavens and the earth
[1:12:17] so this supernatural
[1:12:20] make everything that we perceive as
[1:12:23] natural
[1:12:25] or by nature the things we can touch the
[1:12:28] things we can smell
[1:12:30] the things that we can feel and hear
[1:12:34] and see all those
[1:12:37] uh senses that we have contact the
[1:12:41] contact the natural realm
[1:12:44] and in the natural realm there's things
[1:12:48] like emotions and memories and
[1:12:50] consciences and all those things and
[1:12:53] those things have been caused in us by
[1:12:56] our contact with the natural we've
[1:12:59] developed the other census in our
[1:13:03] in our bodies and in our relationships
[1:13:08] that are based on feelings
[1:13:11] but the supernatural
[1:13:14] only has
[1:13:16] one way
[1:13:18] to
[1:13:20] one
[1:13:21] entrance
[1:13:23] into this world that we're going to need
[1:13:29] and that we hope that we're going to
[1:13:32] is the word of god
[1:13:35] the word of god is the key to the
[1:13:38] supernatural so how do i get in there
[1:13:44] if i need something from there
[1:13:47] or if i if if i believe that it's there
[1:13:51] and i believe that my answers lie there
[1:13:54] i believe that my hope lies there
[1:13:58] i believe that that that it exists now
[1:14:00] if you don't
[1:14:02] believe it exists you're never gonna
[1:14:04] look for the entrance
[1:14:07] to it
[1:14:09] you're never gonna ask yourself
[1:14:11] how do i get in there is it real
[1:14:16] is it the same
[1:14:18] did it create
[1:14:21] heavens and earth
[1:14:23] now you came from some place
[1:14:28] i mean you're you're more
[1:14:30] than something that
[1:14:32] that man could just put together
[1:14:36] look at your intelligence look at your
[1:14:38] heart look at your love for life okay
[1:14:42] and
[1:14:43] john says that the the light shineth in
[1:14:45] this light was the the life of men
[1:14:50] because
[1:14:50] our very life
[1:14:53] came from a
[1:14:54] supernatural source
[1:14:57] so that i think the evidence of of the
[1:15:01] supernatural
[1:15:03] is uh it is so important to us
[1:15:08] now that that the supernatural
[1:15:11] so when the the the supernatural so this
[1:15:15] world came from
[1:15:17] the supernatural
[1:15:20] so in the beginning was the word and so
[1:15:23] from that supernatural realm
[1:15:26] of this supernatural existence there's
[1:15:28] enough power in this
[1:15:31] supernatural realm
[1:15:33] to create
[1:15:35] the heavens and earth
[1:15:39] to set the stars in the sky
[1:15:42] to uh
[1:15:44] to have all the laws of nature that we
[1:15:48] call it the laws of gravity and all
[1:15:51] those things that are placed there
[1:15:54] let's even for a moment consider how
[1:15:57] powerful
[1:15:58] must this supernatural be
[1:16:01] to create the sun
[1:16:05] to create the air you breathe we think
[1:16:08] that we're pretty good off huh how long
[1:16:10] do you think you can live without water
[1:16:15] i forget i don't think it's very long
[1:16:17] some of you might know that are survival
[1:16:21] three days without water
[1:16:23] and then you look like a grape
[1:16:27] no a raisin
[1:16:29] so supposedly you can you can't make it
[1:16:32] three days after three days you're gone
[1:16:34] you're going downhill
[1:16:37] so i mean we think we're so mighty
[1:16:42] but we can't live three days without
[1:16:44] water
[1:16:46] so somebody
[1:16:47] something
[1:16:48] that's supernatural
[1:16:52] had to be able to create something
[1:16:55] that you can't live without all right we
[1:16:58] got three days for water how many days
[1:17:01] can you live without air
[1:17:07] how many hours can you live
[1:17:11] without air who'd like to be my guinea
[1:17:14] pig i'd like to get me a plastic bag
[1:17:18] and we want to
[1:17:20] we uh ever you it's okay but bag around
[1:17:24] you
[1:17:25] and you can
[1:17:27] see how long you can go without
[1:17:28] breathing
[1:17:32] i mean
[1:17:33] here we are
[1:17:35] subject
[1:17:37] to the laws that this supernatural put
[1:17:41] in place
[1:17:45] and we're reliant
[1:17:49] on the supernatural
[1:17:53] just think
[1:17:55] how long can we go
[1:17:58] without our heart beating
[1:18:04] our heart beats
[1:18:06] why does it beat
[1:18:11] it beats because the supernatural
[1:18:15] made it to be
[1:18:17] it gave it the
[1:18:18] life and so
[1:18:20] we we begin if we take a moment
[1:18:24] and we look
[1:18:25] we're reliant on the supernatural
[1:18:32] for our our very life
[1:18:35] because this supernatural
[1:18:37] was the life of men it says all things
[1:18:41] were made by him and without him was not
[1:18:44] anything made that was made and in
[1:18:48] him
[1:18:49] was
[1:18:50] life
[1:18:53] you see what i'm saying in this
[1:18:55] supernatural was the very life that you
[1:19:00] have
[1:19:03] so if that oh that ought to be just the
[1:19:07] simplest answer in the world to the very
[1:19:11] fact that eternal life is a reality
[1:19:14] because life itself came from eternity
[1:19:18] so if life itself comes from
[1:19:21] eternity then we know that there must be
[1:19:26] eternal
[1:19:28] life
[1:19:31] see we only look at sometimes like
[1:19:33] eternal life like it's a reward
[1:19:38] but eternal life is in existence
[1:19:43] it always was
[1:19:45] it never changed
[1:19:48] you understand that the supernatural has
[1:19:51] always always been
[1:19:55] so if we would look at it like it's
[1:19:57] always been there because we're looking
[1:20:00] at supernatural over here on this side
[1:20:03] that the supernatural has always been
[1:20:05] there and and so we we know if if this
[1:20:10] is the uh the scripture tells us
[1:20:13] that in him was life
[1:20:16] and the life was the light of men
[1:20:20] and and so
[1:20:22] we know that everything that we are
[1:20:24] comes from
[1:20:26] this this supernatural
[1:20:31] and without
[1:20:32] this life
[1:20:37] if our heart stops we what
[1:20:41] perish
[1:20:42] we don't drink water
[1:20:45] we perish
[1:20:49] we don't breathe
[1:20:51] we perish
[1:20:53] we can go longer without eating
[1:20:56] but if we don't eat
[1:20:59] we
[1:21:00] perish
[1:21:02] so
[1:21:03] none of us
[1:21:05] possesses life
[1:21:09] within ourselves
[1:21:15] so as long as we have
[1:21:17] water
[1:21:18] as long as we have
[1:21:21] food
[1:21:23] as long as we have air
[1:21:26] and as long as our heart is beating
[1:21:29] we live
[1:21:32] for how long
[1:21:37] now
[1:21:38] my mom's 99 years old
[1:21:43] my dad passed away at 79 years old
[1:21:49] in the last few years i've seen
[1:21:52] many of my friends finish their journey
[1:21:56] here on life
[1:21:59] very few people
[1:22:01] one in millions live i think maybe
[1:22:04] there's a living being somewhere that
[1:22:06] might be
[1:22:07] 120 years old
[1:22:12] but even within everything we have
[1:22:16] we don't
[1:22:18] have
[1:22:20] life
[1:22:23] can you understand life comes from
[1:22:27] the supernatural
[1:22:31] so we know that in order to have eternal
[1:22:35] life
[1:22:37] we would have to have life from the
[1:22:40] supernatural
[1:22:42] and what is the gift of god
[1:22:45] the gift of god is
[1:22:48] eternal
[1:22:49] life
[1:22:52] so that's what god
[1:22:54] that's what god gives
[1:22:56] as his gift
[1:22:58] is eternal life so here we are we can't
[1:23:02] make it if we don't breathe we can't
[1:23:04] make it up our heart don't beat we can't
[1:23:06] make it if we don't uh have food we
[1:23:09] can't make it if we don't have water and
[1:23:11] if we just keep living and living
[1:23:13] eventually we'll perish
[1:23:16] so what reigns in us
[1:23:20] death
[1:23:23] death reigns in our mortal bodies
[1:23:27] we cannot
[1:23:29] live
[1:23:31] without the
[1:23:33] supernatural
[1:23:36] so we're already relying on
[1:23:41] the supernatural
[1:23:45] whether you believe in it or not whether
[1:23:47] you don't believe in genesis 1 1 whether
[1:23:51] you don't believe in john
[1:23:54] you the very
[1:23:56] looking in the
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:24:00] mirror you should be able to know that
[1:24:03] you're living by some other source other
[1:24:06] than yourselves
[1:24:07] how many people have you talked to they
[1:24:10] might call it something else they might
[1:24:13] call it fate
[1:24:14] or they might call it a mystery or or or
[1:24:19] something or
[1:24:20] good luck but how many of you have come
[1:24:23] across
[1:24:24] life-threatening circumstances
[1:24:27] where just just by a miniscule
[1:24:31] second or or
[1:24:33] a
[1:24:34] different turn in events
[1:24:39] you wouldn't be here
[1:24:44] i i remember it still so vivid in me
[1:24:48] a testimony of me and leslie coming up
[1:24:51] from missoula
[1:24:52] montana on our our way up to seeley lake
[1:24:55] montana
[1:24:57] our first winner there
[1:24:59] and we didn't understand ice
[1:25:02] we didn't we didn't understand that
[1:25:05] where shade is ice doesn't go away
[1:25:08] and we're driving up on our volkswagen
[1:25:11] bus and
[1:25:12] and we're coming up and we come around
[1:25:14] this corner and we hit this patch of ice
[1:25:18] and we we go up and how many remember a
[1:25:21] volkswagen well this is what a
[1:25:22] volkswagen looks like
[1:25:26] and you're right here
[1:25:28] your steering wheel and you can see
[1:25:30] almost see the front bumper
[1:25:34] and we hit that ice
[1:25:37] and we go
[1:25:38] up
[1:25:39] over and we're headed towards the rail
[1:25:43] and we the rail disappears
[1:25:46] leslie falls on the floor
[1:25:49] of the of the van i throw my hands up i
[1:25:52] couldn't fall on the floor i threw my
[1:25:54] hands up and just cried out
[1:25:57] jesus help us
[1:26:02] when we came back to our senses
[1:26:06] we were around the corner
[1:26:09] sitting on the side of the road
[1:26:14] no recollection of driving no
[1:26:16] recollection of steering my hands
[1:26:18] weren't on the steering wheel
[1:26:21] or or anything
[1:26:23] but in our desperation
[1:26:28] we cried out to the supernatural
[1:26:34] but what gave us entrance
[1:26:38] into that supernatural was a word
[1:26:42] promise
[1:26:43] i am the present help in the time of
[1:26:46] trouble
[1:26:49] so that word
[1:26:53] became
[1:26:54] our entrance
[1:26:56] into the supernatural
[1:27:01] not only my
[1:27:03] mental
[1:27:04] intellectual part
[1:27:07] but the part that there was a part of
[1:27:10] supernatural in me
[1:27:13] because i was in god's thinking
[1:27:17] so when god being the creator of all
[1:27:20] heaven and earth and the creator of the
[1:27:23] supernatural he had a plan correct
[1:27:27] he's the creator of it
[1:27:30] and i was in that thinking
[1:27:34] from the beginning is that not correct
[1:27:38] we've been taught this
[1:27:41] that if we have eternal life
[1:27:44] we always had eternal life because we
[1:27:47] were in his thinking in the
[1:27:51] beginning
[1:27:55] so he had a plan
[1:27:57] he had my days
[1:28:00] he had what he wanted me to do
[1:28:04] so
[1:28:04] there there had to be an entrance
[1:28:08] into that supernatural
[1:28:11] and the only way
[1:28:13] into that supernatural the only
[1:28:16] entrance into that supernatural saint
[1:28:19] john
[1:28:20] 14 and 6 says i am the way the truth the
[1:28:24] life
[1:28:26] no man cometh unto the supernatural
[1:28:29] but by me
[1:28:32] so there's only
[1:28:34] one entrance
[1:28:36] into the supernatural
[1:28:38] and and so
[1:28:40] whatever whatever came then
[1:28:46] from the supernatural
[1:28:48] right god said let there be
[1:28:52] let there be
[1:28:54] let there be
[1:28:55] so if there was nothing that existed
[1:29:00] nothing that was made everything that
[1:29:02] was made that was made was made by him
[1:29:08] okay so what existed first
[1:29:11] the supernatural
[1:29:14] so if the supernatural
[1:29:17] which is the creator of all things
[1:29:22] everything that was made in other words
[1:29:25] what he spoke
[1:29:26] or said let there be
[1:29:29] whatever came from the supernatural
[1:29:33] now was truth
[1:29:39] that's what it really is
[1:29:42] is that right all truth the word is true
[1:29:47] my word is truth
[1:29:50] heaven and worth will pass away but my
[1:29:54] word which is truth will never pass away
[1:29:59] so when you begin to see that truth
[1:30:03] came from the supernatural
[1:30:07] is that right
[1:30:08] back where truth came from
[1:30:11] so all if
[1:30:14] so
[1:30:15] the truth
[1:30:18] came from the supernatural
[1:30:21] so what the supernatural created
[1:30:25] was truth
[1:30:28] the word is true
[1:30:32] and it remains truth
[1:30:36] because it is truth what was spoken
[1:30:39] first
[1:30:41] or created is what the truth is
[1:30:49] that's where that's what the truth is
[1:30:52] my word is truth
[1:30:54] to what he said
[1:30:56] now there might be facts
[1:30:59] and there might be pictures drawn
[1:31:02] and there might be a lot of other things
[1:31:04] but we know one thing for sure that all
[1:31:07] truth cometh from the father of light
[1:31:13] so there's only really one truth
[1:31:17] and that's the truth
[1:31:19] that came
[1:31:20] from the word of god
[1:31:23] so the only way
[1:31:25] to
[1:31:27] enter the supernatural is by the truth
[1:31:33] right
[1:31:34] and he said my word is
[1:31:37] truth
[1:31:40] so that's true so there's only one way
[1:31:43] to get
[1:31:44] to
[1:31:45] the supernatural
[1:31:48] so when god created
[1:31:54] the heavens and earth
[1:31:56] when he created eden
[1:31:59] and he put his son and daughter
[1:32:02] in eden he told them don't eat
[1:32:07] of that tree
[1:32:09] of good and
[1:32:10] knowledge because the day that you eat
[1:32:13] thereof
[1:32:15] is the day
[1:32:16] you die
[1:32:19] and so the father of lies
[1:32:23] how many knows the father of lies
[1:32:27] i've met him a few times
[1:32:29] and guess what
[1:32:31] every time i met him he lied to me
[1:32:36] he's a liar
[1:32:38] and there's no truth in him
[1:32:43] he's the father
[1:32:45] of all lies
[1:32:50] god had a kingdom
[1:32:52] he had a truth
[1:32:54] he had a plan
[1:32:57] that's the truth it's always been the
[1:33:00] truth
[1:33:01] it'll never change and there's only one
[1:33:04] way that there's only one entrance into
[1:33:07] the supernatural and that's by the word
[1:33:11] of god
[1:33:13] let me
[1:33:14] read this statement if if it's in
[1:33:17] the world falling apart
[1:33:20] and uh
[1:33:25] see if i have it here
[1:33:28] make sure i got the right
[1:33:29] you know this one is in
[1:33:32] i believe it's god's provided place of
[1:33:34] worship
[1:33:35] it's page six paragraph 36
[1:33:40] and we'll start with paragraph 35 i
[1:33:43] don't know if they can find it there or
[1:33:44] not i'd like you to
[1:33:46] i think it makes it easier for you to
[1:33:48] read along with it
[1:33:50] were they able to find that i don't see
[1:33:52] anybody back there but oh there is
[1:33:54] somebody all right
[1:33:57] this is uh in the message
[1:34:00] god's provided place of worship
[1:34:03] of 65
[1:34:05] 4
[1:34:06] 25
[1:34:08] and brother ben says in paragraph 36
[1:34:12] 35 he says and this world must soon come
[1:34:17] to an end
[1:34:20] well
[1:34:22] if our life
[1:34:26] outside of the supernatural comes to an
[1:34:30] end
[1:34:32] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:34:35] life
[1:34:36] then anything that's outside of eternal
[1:34:40] life has to come to a what
[1:34:43] an end
[1:34:45] because there's only one
[1:34:47] form
[1:34:48] of eternal life and that's the
[1:34:51] supernatural
[1:34:53] that's why there's no eternal hell
[1:34:57] because if if if god's gift is eternal
[1:35:01] life
[1:35:05] you don't know how many people would
[1:35:06] rather suffer
[1:35:08] and live
[1:35:13] they'll do everything they can to hang
[1:35:15] on to life
[1:35:20] people don't want to die
[1:35:23] i kind of like what what peter and paul
[1:35:26] in them said to die for me is to gain
[1:35:31] the grave has no victory death has no
[1:35:34] sting
[1:35:35] i go to get a crown that's laid up for
[1:35:37] me i fought a good fight i've ran a good
[1:35:40] race
[1:35:41] i'd be believing it so anything that
[1:35:43] doesn't that wasn't in
[1:35:47] the supernatural
[1:35:49] to begin with
[1:35:51] it wasn't
[1:35:52] thought
[1:35:53] and spoken
[1:35:57] will
[1:35:58] come to an end
[1:36:00] and so he said here he says in this
[1:36:03] world
[1:36:05] must soon come to an end
[1:36:08] it can't go much longer
[1:36:11] sin is too deep
[1:36:14] now what is sin
[1:36:16] sin is unbelief
[1:36:19] what is it
[1:36:22] that they don't believe
[1:36:25] it's not really
[1:36:27] so complicated
[1:36:29] they don't believe in the existence
[1:36:33] of the supernatural
[1:36:36] and they don't believe that's where life
[1:36:38] came from
[1:36:40] neither do they believe that the very
[1:36:43] life that they have now
[1:36:46] is being sustained by this supernatural
[1:36:51] whether they believe it or not
[1:36:56] so if god's the giver of life
[1:36:59] and he would take that life away
[1:37:02] no man can survive on their own
[1:37:07] no man
[1:37:10] can survive
[1:37:12] no matter how smart they think they are
[1:37:15] how intelligent they think they are that
[1:37:18] can't survive
[1:37:20] we're totally reliant
[1:37:24] why
[1:37:25] why
[1:37:26] the lord asks paul why do you kick
[1:37:29] against the brick paul
[1:37:31] why do you fight
[1:37:33] don't you know i have a work for you to
[1:37:35] do
[1:37:37] don't you know i'm calling you you're
[1:37:40] going to be a messenger to the gentile
[1:37:42] and paul's here trying to
[1:37:45] to throw in prison
[1:37:48] and murder
[1:37:51] the very people that believe in the
[1:37:53] supernatural
[1:37:55] because they think it's
[1:37:57] heresy
[1:37:58] but god's got a different plan for his
[1:38:00] life and he's in this great big battle
[1:38:05] that's why the great prophet told this
[1:38:07] he says why halt you between two
[1:38:09] opinions
[1:38:11] if god be god serve him
[1:38:13] if baal be god serve him
[1:38:17] as for me and my house
[1:38:20] we'll serve the lord
[1:38:25] so as we we read this here he says
[1:38:29] he says
[1:38:31] sins too deep it's beyond hope there is
[1:38:34] no more hope for the world it's past
[1:38:37] that
[1:38:39] i believe the holy spirit is gleaning in
[1:38:42] the fields
[1:38:44] finding this one
[1:38:47] and that one
[1:38:48] for the hour is far spent
[1:38:53] the gospel has been preached to every
[1:38:56] nations
[1:38:57] isms and thinks has followed it
[1:39:00] but yet the gospel
[1:39:03] has went out went on
[1:39:06] just the same
[1:39:09] and now at the end time
[1:39:12] we see the things happening
[1:39:15] the way
[1:39:17] they
[1:39:18] they are
[1:39:19] there are great warnings amongst
[1:39:22] the elect people
[1:39:24] of god to find what is right
[1:39:29] it behooves us to know that
[1:39:33] now not
[1:39:34] somebody's theology but what is the
[1:39:39] truth
[1:39:40] so what
[1:39:42] what is
[1:39:43] eternal
[1:39:48] that that's what we should be looking
[1:39:50] for
[1:39:52] in other words we say eternal but what's
[1:39:54] another word for eternal what is
[1:39:57] super
[1:39:59] natural
[1:40:00] we should be looking for something
[1:40:04] that is
[1:40:05] super
[1:40:06] natural
[1:40:09] that's what we should be looking for
[1:40:11] this exists right the supernatural
[1:40:14] exists
[1:40:15] it's never changed it's always been the
[1:40:17] same the only way to get into it is
[1:40:20] through the word of god so it behooves
[1:40:23] us with the world falling apart
[1:40:26] don't can't we see the world falling
[1:40:28] apart
[1:40:31] people are waiting in lines and lines
[1:40:33] and lines for hours
[1:40:36] wouldn't it be wonderful if they were
[1:40:38] waiting in lines to get into church
[1:40:43] to have hands laid on them
[1:40:47] to receive the baptism
[1:40:49] of the holy spirit
[1:40:51] wouldn't it be wonderful if they were
[1:40:54] waiting for hours to come into the
[1:40:56] contact into the presence
[1:41:00] of the life-giver himself
[1:41:04] into the presence of of the supernatural
[1:41:10] who created heavens and earth
[1:41:13] who has all power
[1:41:15] that can do everything wouldn't it be
[1:41:17] more wonderful to get into that
[1:41:23] but we've got to come to a place where
[1:41:25] we believe in that we believe that's our
[1:41:28] hope
[1:41:30] my salvation cometh from the lord
[1:41:35] that's that's where all our confidence
[1:41:37] is for everything
[1:41:40] i think that it's by human nature we
[1:41:43] wait too long to run to the lord we have
[1:41:46] to exhaust everything else before we go
[1:41:49] there
[1:41:53] but that's how we are
[1:41:55] you know
[1:41:58] so let's just keep reading here he says
[1:42:01] it behooves us to know that
[1:42:03] not some theology
[1:42:05] but to know what is truth
[1:42:10] to know what is truth
[1:42:14] the supernatural is
[1:42:16] truth amen
[1:42:19] this supernatural is the only truth the
[1:42:22] only way to get there into the
[1:42:24] supernatural is by the word
[1:42:32] what the bible says
[1:42:34] is
[1:42:35] the
[1:42:36] truth
[1:42:39] and so we know that right by if we would
[1:42:42] read in
[1:42:44] hebrews
[1:42:45] the first chapter
[1:42:48] it says this god
[1:42:50] who at
[1:42:51] sun-dried times
[1:42:54] and in diverse manners
[1:42:57] spake in times past unto the fathers by
[1:43:00] the prophets
[1:43:02] have in these last days spoken
[1:43:06] unto us by his son
[1:43:09] whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:43:11] things by whom
[1:43:14] also he made
[1:43:16] the worlds
[1:43:18] so if we come right back around to this
[1:43:21] truth
[1:43:22] to the supernatural
[1:43:24] now this supernatural is here for you
[1:43:30] that's what jesus came and preached
[1:43:33] he came and preached the kingdom of god
[1:43:36] the supernatural this place that that is
[1:43:40] truth where everything was made all
[1:43:44] power has been given to me over all
[1:43:47] heavens and all the earth i have power
[1:43:50] to lay down my life down and to take it
[1:43:53] up again
[1:43:56] just let this beautiful uh
[1:43:59] sink in for a second
[1:44:01] because it'll be too late one of these
[1:44:04] days for us
[1:44:05] and this may be the day
[1:44:08] so let's
[1:44:09] take
[1:44:10] real consideration
[1:44:13] of what god
[1:44:15] has
[1:44:16] said
[1:44:19] so what is what is god what did god say
[1:44:23] his what
[1:44:24] his word
[1:44:26] let us take real consideration
[1:44:29] of what god has said
[1:44:32] remember when god speaks a word
[1:44:36] he can never take it back
[1:44:42] he has
[1:44:43] to ever remain
[1:44:46] the
[1:44:46] same
[1:44:48] he can never say something
[1:44:51] and then say well i didn't exactly mean
[1:44:55] that
[1:44:57] see
[1:44:58] he is infinite
[1:45:01] he knows the best
[1:45:04] to begin with
[1:45:06] we say things that we think is best
[1:45:09] and after a while we take it back
[1:45:12] but god can't do that
[1:45:15] and remain god
[1:45:18] so he is infinite
[1:45:20] he does not do that
[1:45:23] because he is perfect in every word
[1:45:28] he never utters a word unless it's
[1:45:33] eternal
[1:45:39] so here's the supernatural
[1:45:42] the eternal
[1:45:44] and he utters a word
[1:45:47] now that word is what
[1:45:49] eternal
[1:45:52] now that
[1:45:53] becomes
[1:45:54] the entrance
[1:45:57] into your world
[1:46:00] god enters your world
[1:46:02] whether it's sickness whether it's
[1:46:04] finance whether it's no matter what
[1:46:07] troubles no matter whether things are
[1:46:10] going good or bad
[1:46:12] he only enters your world by his
[1:46:17] word
[1:46:20] so if i could say it this way
[1:46:22] it's a two-way street
[1:46:26] i don't have a better vocabulary
[1:46:29] but
[1:46:30] he gives his word
[1:46:33] and his word is the way back to him
[1:46:37] the only way in
[1:46:41] and if you believe it
[1:46:44] you take it
[1:46:47] if you're not sure
[1:46:50] then you're going to wait it the
[1:46:52] doorway we'll try to hurry up a little
[1:46:55] warm in here i think and
[1:46:57] people are falling asleep
[1:46:59] because that's because they were up all
[1:47:01] night praying for the service and
[1:47:04] fasting and it finally caught up with
[1:47:05] them this morning
[1:47:07] but it's okay
[1:47:09] brother graham said he preached to a lot
[1:47:11] of tired people so i guess i can too
[1:47:14] i'm going to hurry up i'm almost done
[1:47:17] he says
[1:47:19] so
[1:47:20] he said
[1:47:21] he does not do that because he's perfect
[1:47:24] in every word
[1:47:25] he never others a word unless it's
[1:47:27] eternal
[1:47:29] all of his
[1:47:31] all of his eternity
[1:47:34] was with him at the beginning
[1:47:37] his thoughts his attributes
[1:47:40] and they only expressed themselves
[1:47:44] in the world
[1:47:48] today all of it was with them
[1:47:51] the beginning
[1:47:52] in eternity we won't go there so we're
[1:47:55] just going to lay that down
[1:47:57] there and now we're going to switch
[1:47:59] gears
[1:48:00] just for
[1:48:01] a second so we know that we have
[1:48:05] the supernatural
[1:48:08] we know the only way under the
[1:48:09] supernatural is the word of god
[1:48:13] we know that in sun dried times and by
[1:48:15] diverse manners god spoke to us by this
[1:48:18] prophet
[1:48:19] then he spoke to us by his son
[1:48:21] is that right and man recorded the
[1:48:24] things that god said
[1:48:26] and said and he said it is the bible
[1:48:30] now where's our problem come
[1:48:34] well
[1:48:35] man took this book
[1:48:40] right
[1:48:42] so what are they going to do
[1:48:43] well first of all we have a scientist
[1:48:47] our brother
[1:48:49] general come here i call my general
[1:48:52] we appreciate your service
[1:48:54] today you are a scientist
[1:48:57] okay so you come right here mr scientist
[1:49:00] all right he's he's he's a scientist
[1:49:03] a scientist does experiments
[1:49:07] and things to further knowledge
[1:49:11] all right so we
[1:49:12] we we have we have a a a scientist
[1:49:18] all right kit come here you're going to
[1:49:20] be uh
[1:49:21] you come up here
[1:49:29] you're going to be a
[1:49:31] mathematician
[1:49:33] all right
[1:49:34] do you like math
[1:49:36] oh
[1:49:38] what can i say a mathematician
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:46] lamborghini
[1:49:49] you come up here
[1:49:56] you come right here you're a politician
[1:50:02] have you ever met lamborghini
[1:50:04] he'll get you to vote for him
[1:50:07] all righty
[1:50:08] and now now we need uh let me see here
[1:50:12] yeah
[1:50:14] uh john you come up here you be a you're
[1:50:16] an educator
[1:50:22] all right john he can play any
[1:50:24] instruments you know some on the base
[1:50:25] today and the organ and everything all
[1:50:28] right so we've got an educator
[1:50:30] we've got a scientist a mathematician
[1:50:34] a a politician an educator
[1:50:40] i need a theologian
[1:50:43] all right
[1:50:47] so
[1:50:48] now all these guys come here here you go
[1:50:51] here's the book
[1:50:54] now i'll gather around the book here
[1:50:55] come up around the book
[1:50:57] and everything now they're going to read
[1:50:59] the book
[1:51:03] right
[1:51:04] and
[1:51:05] they're going to start looking a
[1:51:07] scientist is going to look at it
[1:51:09] and politicians going to look at it in
[1:51:11] the mathematician oh god said 7 here in
[1:51:15] 40 days here and this here and that here
[1:51:18] and he's going to look at it and now the
[1:51:20] educator is looking at it how am i going
[1:51:23] to teach this how am i going to explain
[1:51:26] it how am i going to make this fit
[1:51:27] together and and he's here he said
[1:51:30] hearing he spoke to his father and and i
[1:51:34] can do nothing unless my father shows me
[1:51:37] but yeah i haven't done so he's got to
[1:51:38] come up he's a and then we got the
[1:51:40] theologian
[1:51:46] he said how am i going to preach this
[1:51:50] so they take the word of god and they
[1:51:53] study on the word of god and they look
[1:51:55] on the word of god and then they say
[1:51:59] this is what god must have meant
[1:52:07] okay there's only one entrance
[1:52:09] into the supernatural
[1:52:14] but the only way the supernatural can be
[1:52:17] understood is by the
[1:52:19] supernatural
[1:52:22] it can't be understood by the politician
[1:52:25] but by the mathematician
[1:52:28] it can't be understood by uh by by the
[1:52:33] educator or the theologian it can it
[1:52:36] can't be understood by that so they look
[1:52:39] on the word of god
[1:52:43] they don't look at the word of god as an
[1:52:46] entrance
[1:52:47] into the supernatural
[1:52:51] they look at it as how can i present
[1:52:54] this to the people
[1:53:00] so they come up with
[1:53:03] a system
[1:53:07] he adds a little he adds a little he
[1:53:10] adds a lot he adds a little he adds
[1:53:12] hardly nothing
[1:53:14] because i don't believe in theologians
[1:53:20] and they come up with something
[1:53:24] right but since they can't all agree
[1:53:28] they create different what
[1:53:30] different systems
[1:53:32] for different tastes
[1:53:34] right and so once they
[1:53:37] a group of men determine that this is
[1:53:39] what it means
[1:53:42] or if i could say it this way this is
[1:53:45] what god meant when he said this
[1:53:51] right so they agree
[1:53:53] now they touch all
[1:53:55] all realms of society
[1:54:00] so now they have a gospel
[1:54:02] or an explanation of the word of god
[1:54:06] that everybody can swallow
[1:54:09] because they believe it's what they
[1:54:11] believe it's true
[1:54:13] they just can't understand it
[1:54:16] because it doesn't come by understanding
[1:54:19] what's it come by
[1:54:21] by revelation
[1:54:27] i am the way the truth the life i am the
[1:54:30] door
[1:54:33] no man cometh unto me unless the father
[1:54:37] leads them
[1:54:41] man can't get there
[1:54:44] it's impossible
[1:54:46] for the great minds of our age
[1:54:49] to be able to look at this word
[1:54:52] and find the door
[1:54:57] because the door has to be
[1:55:00] revealed
[1:55:02] you can't educate you can't come here
[1:55:05] and join church
[1:55:10] it doesn't do you no good
[1:55:12] if you know where the door is if you
[1:55:14] don't walk through it
[1:55:18] so they've come up with this great thing
[1:55:20] so every time a group of men comes
[1:55:23] together they put the word of god in
[1:55:26] certain orders they leave certain parts
[1:55:28] of it out because they can't make it fit
[1:55:31] they come up with certain ideas certain
[1:55:34] things all their ideas is what is called
[1:55:38] a
[1:55:38] creed
[1:55:43] a creed is
[1:55:45] man's
[1:55:47] expression
[1:55:49] or explanation of saying
[1:55:52] this is what god meant
[1:55:56] this is what he's saying we have studied
[1:55:58] the word of god
[1:56:00] and this is our interpretation of the
[1:56:03] word of god
[1:56:05] except our interpretation
[1:56:08] join yourself to the system
[1:56:11] that we're providing the system of
[1:56:14] thought
[1:56:16] this scripture means this this scripture
[1:56:18] means this this scripture means that
[1:56:21] this is what we believe
[1:56:23] this is our creed and everybody that
[1:56:26] joins themselves to that creed has now
[1:56:30] denominated
[1:56:32] around that creed thank you my great
[1:56:35] scientists
[1:56:36] my politicians my mathematicians my
[1:56:39] educators my spirit-filled brother
[1:56:47] so
[1:56:48] what has man provided
[1:56:52] because not everybody was in god's
[1:56:54] thinking
[1:57:00] oh
[1:57:01] but they've got a gospel for
[1:57:04] everybody
[1:57:07] you don't like one taste
[1:57:11] we've got all kinds of tastes
[1:57:16] our scientists and our educators in our
[1:57:19] mathematician has developed a taste
[1:57:24] that's perfect for you
[1:57:27] it's a thinking man's filter
[1:57:33] all your thoughts
[1:57:35] we've taken upon ourselves to take your
[1:57:39] thoughts filter them through our
[1:57:41] education
[1:57:42] and then feed you a creed
[1:57:45] that meets your
[1:57:47] taste
[1:57:50] how many have heard that message
[1:57:53] thinking man's filter
[1:57:56] here brother brahms telling them
[1:57:59] the supernatural is real
[1:58:02] there's only one way into the
[1:58:04] supernatural realm and that's by the
[1:58:06] word of god
[1:58:09] there's no other way all these people
[1:58:11] are doing is supplying you a temporary
[1:58:15] substitute
[1:58:19] something that
[1:58:21] fits your mind
[1:58:23] now if there's only one truth
[1:58:28] and there's so many different churches
[1:58:31] so many different doctrines and so many
[1:58:34] different creeds that something is
[1:58:38] wrong
[1:58:42] is that pretty simple
[1:58:44] not all the ways
[1:58:46] oh so they'll say it's like a wheel
[1:58:50] all spokes
[1:58:52] lead
[1:58:53] to the center
[1:58:59] so the person that created all of
[1:59:02] heavens and earth
[1:59:04] said everything in order
[1:59:07] can't provide
[1:59:09] a place of worship
[1:59:14] he can't provide a spokesman for the
[1:59:18] truth
[1:59:21] jesus said heaven and earth will pass
[1:59:23] away but my word will not pass away
[1:59:27] all that cometh unto the father cometh
[1:59:30] through me
[1:59:31] and there's anyone that enters into the
[1:59:34] realm of eternal life
[1:59:37] which is where everything that you have
[1:59:40] need of exists
[1:59:43] your job exists there
[1:59:46] your food exists there
[1:59:49] your heartbeat exists there your breath
[1:59:52] exists there your water exists there
[1:59:57] everything you have need of comes from
[1:59:59] the supernatural and there's only one
[2:00:02] way into the supernatural there's one
[2:00:04] key to get in there
[2:00:06] that's his word
[2:00:10] and now here all these men come along
[2:00:13] with all these creeds and dogmas and
[2:00:15] substitutes and and everything and you
[2:00:18] notice
[2:00:19] none of them take you into the
[2:00:22] supernatural in fact some of them will
[2:00:25] actually deny that the days of miracles
[2:00:29] are here others will say you don't need
[2:00:32] that spirit you just confess that your
[2:00:35] sins are forgiven
[2:00:42] i don't want nothing i got to settle
[2:00:44] at the river
[2:00:46] i want to settle it now
[2:00:51] i want to know
[2:00:52] i don't want to substitute
[2:00:56] but god in
[2:00:59] in every time and he has spoken
[2:01:04] to us
[2:01:05] by his servants and by his prophets
[2:01:09] and so we have
[2:01:10] a place
[2:01:12] that
[2:01:13] that is supernatural and every promise
[2:01:18] in the bible is super
[2:01:20] naturally administrated
[2:01:26] he said he would not leave us nor
[2:01:28] forsaken us
[2:01:30] but he'd be with us even in us till the
[2:01:32] end
[2:01:35] so
[2:01:36] another don't worry what's going on in
[2:01:38] your minds
[2:01:40] that's where the battle is
[2:01:44] but
[2:01:45] there's a way
[2:01:46] into the supernatural and that's by his
[2:01:50] word
[2:01:52] by these great
[2:01:54] exceedingly great and precious promises
[2:01:57] we are partakers of what
[2:02:00] divine
[2:02:02] nature
[2:02:03] by these promises
[2:02:06] we are partakers of the supernatural
[2:02:10] who knows what we have need of even
[2:02:13] before we ask
[2:02:19] oh how how
[2:02:22] quicker things would happen in our lives
[2:02:25] if if we would first of all make
[2:02:27] entrance into the supernatural
[2:02:30] where he could speak to us
[2:02:32] we could lay our petitions before us he
[2:02:35] could reason together with us and show
[2:02:38] us why that's not the way to go that's
[2:02:40] the way to do we can walk from his
[2:02:42] throne saying yes my child i'll give
[2:02:44] that to you
[2:02:47] it's settled
[2:02:49] forever
[2:02:52] and and
[2:02:53] and like what brother tim read in the
[2:02:56] psalm i don't know if i caught it right
[2:02:58] but he
[2:02:59] he made simply it was a don't hasten or
[2:03:01] don't make a
[2:03:02] bad decision based on the pressures of
[2:03:05] your enemies and and the darkness that's
[2:03:07] coming against you
[2:03:10] we don't have to rush to quick decisions
[2:03:14] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[2:03:17] their strength they shall mount up like
[2:03:20] the wings of eagles they shall run and
[2:03:22] not be weary they shall walk and not
[2:03:24] faint
[2:03:27] that scriptural word
[2:03:30] that's an entrance
[2:03:32] into the supernatural
[2:03:34] and and so
[2:03:36] god promises us in this last day
[2:03:39] we have all this substitutes over here
[2:03:44] that five of the smartest men in the
[2:03:46] whole world has come up with
[2:03:49] none of them agreeing
[2:03:52] none of them showing any signs and
[2:03:55] wonders
[2:03:57] or proof
[2:04:00] that what they're saying is true
[2:04:02] they only appeal to one realm
[2:04:08] and that's the intellectual
[2:04:10] and the cardinal
[2:04:12] and reasoning
[2:04:15] we used to have a saying
[2:04:18] in montana
[2:04:21] it said
[2:04:23] sheep
[2:04:25] ten thousand coyotes can't be wrong
[2:04:34] because there's more of them
[2:04:38] then of you
[2:04:40] fear not
[2:04:41] little flock
[2:04:45] because it's one in a million
[2:04:49] because
[2:04:50] they've got multitudes
[2:04:53] united together
[2:04:56] against
[2:04:57] the belief
[2:05:00] that everything comes from the
[2:05:02] supernatural
[2:05:05] god never changed his mind about what
[2:05:09] his word
[2:05:11] what he spoke
[2:05:14] in the beginning
[2:05:15] is still the same
[2:05:19] it never changes it's not change
[2:05:22] in the beginning created he
[2:05:25] them male and female created he them
[2:05:29] they're still only males and they're
[2:05:32] still only females
[2:05:35] i don't care if the psychiatrist
[2:05:40] i must have left him out
[2:05:43] the psychiatrist
[2:05:45] the politician
[2:05:47] the educator
[2:05:50] the physicians
[2:05:52] feel they can change that
[2:05:54] you can't
[2:05:56] change god's word
[2:06:01] you can't do it
[2:06:07] that's the last thing satan wants to
[2:06:09] acknowledge
[2:06:11] he wants it to be his eden
[2:06:14] he wants to be the god of this evil age
[2:06:17] he wants
[2:06:18] man not to find the entry into the
[2:06:22] supernatural he doesn't want people to
[2:06:25] take this word
[2:06:27] on its own because god interprets his
[2:06:30] word by bringing it to pass he doesn't
[2:06:33] want anybody to take this word on their
[2:06:35] own take a promise of god
[2:06:38] enter that where and enter into the
[2:06:41] supernatural by the promise of god's
[2:06:44] word
[2:06:47] with nothing else supporting it
[2:06:54] science doesn't support it
[2:06:56] education math
[2:06:58] nothing supports it
[2:07:01] because it's the truth
[2:07:03] from the beginning
[2:07:05] and he opens this up to us that the
[2:07:08] realm we can enter into that realm and
[2:07:12] watch the supernatural be made
[2:07:14] manifested
[2:07:17] so here comes a man in our day
[2:07:20] people say why do you believe in a
[2:07:21] prophet
[2:07:24] because the system is not keeping the
[2:07:27] world from falling apart
[2:07:34] just the way it was said it would come
[2:07:39] it's coming
[2:07:40] lovers of pleasure
[2:07:42] more than lovers of god knowledge
[2:07:45] increasing men running to and fro
[2:07:49] every
[2:07:50] prophecy
[2:07:52] that the work which spoken
[2:07:56] is coming to pass
[2:07:58] but here comes one
[2:08:01] and his message is simple
[2:08:05] back to
[2:08:06] the
[2:08:07] word
[2:08:10] back to the scriptures back to the only
[2:08:13] way into the supernatural
[2:08:16] back to eternal life
[2:08:19] now what separates them
[2:08:23] oh
[2:08:26] their creed
[2:08:28] it'll touch all the mathematicians
[2:08:32] it'll touch all the politicians
[2:08:34] it'll touch all the educated
[2:08:37] it'll touch all the science
[2:08:41] they've got a gospel
[2:08:44] that's for everybody
[2:08:50] but the supernatural
[2:08:52] is only for those that are
[2:08:55] supernatural
[2:08:58] my sheep
[2:08:59] hear
[2:09:00] my
[2:09:01] voice
[2:09:03] and another
[2:09:04] they won't follow
[2:09:09] because they have something in them
[2:09:15] that hears that voice it doesn't come by
[2:09:19] knowledge it comes by
[2:09:21] revelation
[2:09:24] he reveals
[2:09:26] the way
[2:09:28] i am the way the truth
[2:09:30] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[2:09:34] who do men say that i am
[2:09:37] peter said some say you're this
[2:09:39] the scientist said you were this
[2:09:42] the mathematician said you were this the
[2:09:45] politicians said you were this
[2:09:50] the civilization said you were that
[2:09:53] they say but who do you say that i am
[2:09:57] thou art the christ
[2:09:59] the son of the living god
[2:10:03] and jesus answered them flesh and blood
[2:10:11] all my five or six
[2:10:14] flesh and bloods up here
[2:10:17] didn't reveal it to you
[2:10:21] but my father which is in heaven has
[2:10:24] revealed it to you do you understand
[2:10:27] there's too much flesh and blood
[2:10:31] way too much flesh and blood
[2:10:36] people that have sowed ideas and sowed
[2:10:39] definitions and sold meanings
[2:10:42] but that's why god promised
[2:10:46] that there would be malachi 4 5.
[2:10:49] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 that there
[2:10:52] would be a
[2:10:54] ministry that came back and returned the
[2:10:59] revelation
[2:11:01] back to the children
[2:11:05] what revelation did they have
[2:11:09] they saw that jesus was the son of god
[2:11:13] the way to the supernatural god's only
[2:11:17] provided place of worship and he came
[2:11:19] back to restore
[2:11:22] that
[2:11:22] faith
[2:11:25] in the key
[2:11:28] so you could get into the supernatural
[2:11:32] you may be going through a mental battle
[2:11:34] a physical battle financial battle i
[2:11:37] don't care what your battle is
[2:11:40] it's one answer
[2:11:44] and that's jesus christ
[2:11:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[2:11:49] never change
[2:11:51] but you have all these voices
[2:11:54] you have all these people
[2:11:57] with their bibles
[2:11:59] all standing here one here his group is
[2:12:02] put together this is what he meant this
[2:12:04] is what he meant this is what he meant
[2:12:07] no
[2:12:08] this is what he meant
[2:12:10] this is what he meant
[2:12:12] this is what he meant
[2:12:14] he's three gods this is water baptism
[2:12:18] over here no speaking in tongues is
[2:12:20] evidence of that is speaking in tongues
[2:12:23] this one's over here no you've got to be
[2:12:25] baptized twice oh oh no you you've got
[2:12:28] to worship on saturday
[2:12:33] how many different explanations are
[2:12:35] there was if there's one eternal source
[2:12:40] then there has to be one truth
[2:12:44] because truth didn't originate
[2:12:48] from any other place
[2:12:50] but the supernatural
[2:12:55] so it if a man can't figure it out
[2:13:01] so god promised in our day
[2:13:04] the simplicity of this message that he
[2:13:07] would come and veil himself in flesh
[2:13:12] do the same signs and wonders
[2:13:16] that he did when he was here on earth
[2:13:19] with the jews
[2:13:22] to the gentiles
[2:13:24] so the
[2:13:26] entrance
[2:13:27] into the supernatural
[2:13:30] once again would return the hearts of
[2:13:32] the children to the faith that the word
[2:13:39] just the way it's spoken
[2:13:42] just the way it's written
[2:13:45] is the key to the supernatural
[2:13:48] you don't i'm not the key
[2:13:51] i'm not the door
[2:13:53] i'm not the way christian life
[2:13:55] tabernacle is not the key or the door
[2:14:01] william branham as a human being
[2:14:04] was not the key
[2:14:06] or the door but the words which he spoke
[2:14:09] was eternal
[2:14:14] because his ministry was to tell us what
[2:14:18] it was that jesus taught
[2:14:20] in the beginning what came from eternity
[2:14:24] that's how you know you're in your
[2:14:25] thinking that's how you know there's a
[2:14:27] lamb's book of life that's how you know
[2:14:29] there's water baptism that's how you
[2:14:31] know there's divine healing that's how
[2:14:33] you know there's not three gods
[2:14:35] because you have a voice
[2:14:38] that's speaking the truth
[2:14:41] when he comes
[2:14:43] the spirit of truth
[2:14:46] he'll lead and guide you and he'll tell
[2:14:49] you of things to come
[2:14:52] that's why last week i said you see the
[2:14:54] trinity
[2:14:56] because if you have a trinity
[2:14:59] you've got to make that scripture
[2:15:02] i think it's john 14 6 wasn't it
[2:15:08] find this real quick
[2:15:10] or did i just read john 14 and 6
[2:15:15] 16 and
[2:15:23] 16 and
[2:15:24] 4
[2:15:26] right
[2:15:27] somebody help me
[2:15:29] 16 13
[2:15:31] how be it when he
[2:15:33] the spirit of truth
[2:15:35] so remember we read that if god ever
[2:15:38] does anything it's by his what his
[2:15:40] spirit spirit moved upon the water
[2:15:46] so he says
[2:15:48] when
[2:15:49] he the spirit of
[2:15:52] truth
[2:15:55] okay
[2:15:56] what was eternal
[2:15:59] the truth
[2:16:00] what is the spirit of truth it's god
[2:16:07] right because all truth came from
[2:16:09] eternity is that right so the spirit of
[2:16:13] truth
[2:16:15] is what god
[2:16:17] spoke
[2:16:19] into existence when he created all
[2:16:22] things
[2:16:23] the spirit of a lie is the perversion
[2:16:27] that followed of man trying to explain
[2:16:31] and interpret god's word
[2:16:33] how does god interpret his word
[2:16:36] by bringing it to pass
[2:16:38] so when you understand there's only one
[2:16:40] spirit
[2:16:42] there's only one god you don't think
[2:16:45] saint john 1 and make it to people
[2:16:52] it's the spirit
[2:16:55] how be it when he the spirit of truth is
[2:16:58] come
[2:16:59] he will guide you into all truth
[2:17:02] for he shall not speak of himself
[2:17:05] but whatsoever things
[2:17:08] he shall hear
[2:17:10] that shall be speak
[2:17:12] and he will show you
[2:17:14] things to come
[2:17:16] when you begin to understand that it all
[2:17:19] comes from the fountain of truth
[2:17:23] so brother brahms that scripture fits
[2:17:26] brother abraham's ministry
[2:17:30] because it's he the spirit of truth was
[2:17:34] he who created heavens and earth
[2:17:38] right it was he that moved upon the
[2:17:40] waters it was he it was god that's why
[2:17:43] the messenger said when the holy spirit
[2:17:46] comes
[2:17:47] and does these things to speak one word
[2:17:50] against it in this world or the world to
[2:17:53] come there shall be no
[2:17:55] forgiveness
[2:17:57] for that
[2:18:00] so god veils himself in flesh
[2:18:03] come back to the gentile age and points
[2:18:06] to us back to
[2:18:08] the entrance
[2:18:11] into eternal life
[2:18:15] and none of the theologians the
[2:18:17] mathematicians the scientists the
[2:18:19] politicians or none of them
[2:18:23] can accept it
[2:18:25] and because they think that they're
[2:18:27] great
[2:18:29] in number
[2:18:31] and in worldly wisdom
[2:18:34] and they join their forces
[2:18:36] together they think they have strength
[2:18:39] and power
[2:18:41] but yet their world
[2:18:43] is falling apart
[2:18:47] and yet we're hid
[2:18:49] in the cleft of the rock
[2:18:54] not a real popular young people
[2:18:57] school age kids
[2:19:00] you that are here that go to high school
[2:19:03] you've got a pretty basic understanding
[2:19:07] of why we understand and know
[2:19:12] that god sent a prophet
[2:19:17] and pointed to us the way
[2:19:21] and restored the faith
[2:19:24] back in
[2:19:25] the supernatural
[2:19:29] the best thing you have going for you
[2:19:30] this morning
[2:19:32] is the supernatural do you love the lord
[2:19:35] this morning amen let's stand together
[2:19:37] this morning

[2:20:46] but if there's anything i can leave with
[2:20:49] you
[2:20:50] this morning
[2:20:53] it's the supernatural
[2:20:55] is still here
[2:20:57] never left
[2:20:59] never gone away
[2:21:04] satan's done everything to
[2:21:07] discredit it
[2:21:12] to run it down mark it
[2:21:16] make it a dirty thing
[2:21:24] try to hide it from us and
[2:21:26] make the word of god of none effect
[2:21:32] but the supernatural is still the
[2:21:34] elect's portion
[2:21:37] it always will be and it'll never change
[2:21:42] so let us bow our heads this morning
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:47] what do you believe this morning
[2:21:49] [Music]
[2:21:51] do you believe there's a supernatural
[2:21:53] realm
[2:21:56] do you believe that
[2:22:01] it was put on display in our generation
[2:22:05] by the discerning of the thoughts and
[2:22:08] intents of the heart
[2:22:11] by laying on of hands
[2:22:17] by
[2:22:18] inexpression
[2:22:20] of the divine power of god raising
[2:22:23] people from the dead and
[2:22:26] opening
[2:22:27] blind eyes
[2:22:29] the lame walking the deaf hearing
[2:22:33] the great supernatural
[2:22:38] on display in our day
[2:22:42] to once again restore
[2:22:45] the key
[2:22:48] to the supernatural
[2:22:51] oh god your word is the key to the
[2:22:53] supernatural
[2:22:56] any person that wants to come to the
[2:22:58] supernatural
[2:23:00] must come by the way of the word
[2:23:04] lord i pray that you take the simplicity
