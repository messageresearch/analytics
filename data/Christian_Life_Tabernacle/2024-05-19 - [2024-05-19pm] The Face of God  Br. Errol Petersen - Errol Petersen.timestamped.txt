[26:03] we want to open
[26:06] um service and prayer and also take up
[26:08] the ties and offerings and bring some um
[26:12] request before the church
[26:19] um sister Atlanta has an unspoken prayer
[26:22] request for
[26:24] tomorrow we know that God knows the
[26:26] heart he knows the need
[26:30] and we can as a body take an unspoken
[26:32] prayer request before the Lord and
[26:35] intercede and ask God to move on behalf
[26:37] of this request also uh we have a prayer
[26:40] request for Felix long who is suffering
[26:42] from
[26:44] paralysis
[26:47] um um sister Joy is asking prayer for
[26:54] her sister Jenna she's going into labor
[26:56] and we're just uh believing together for
[26:59] just a successful delivery in the health
[27:01] of the baby and the mother just pray
[27:04] that God would just move on the scene
[27:06] and just take away any nervousness any
[27:09] anxiety any fear just cast that right
[27:12] out of the room and may they just
[27:13] experience the joy and the gift that God
[27:16] is giving them to bring a life and what
[27:18] I believe is another son or daughter of
[27:20] God into this world maybe that'll be the
[27:23] last one and we'll just be caught right
[27:25] out of here huh it's going to happen one
[27:27] of these days
[27:29] I'm looking forward to it amen also um
[27:33] we we just want to um brother Jeff
[27:37] Howard was just leaving after service
[27:39] and a lot of us had a detour um leaving
[27:42] the church and little did we know that
[27:44] was brother Jeff that had been in an
[27:46] accident both involved in the accident
[27:49] the um as far as there's nothing serious
[27:52] but yet uh there are some they're banged
[27:55] up a little bit um and
[27:58] uh it it's put brother Jeff in a little
[28:00] bit of a bind because he was starting a
[28:02] a job tomorrow and now he's in a
[28:05] predicament of of transportation and um
[28:09] he's a uh
[28:12] just kind of in wonderment of of how um
[28:17] the timing of this but I know one thing
[28:20] we have a promise all things work
[28:24] together for good so then I believe as a
[28:27] body of believer belies we can believe
[28:29] together and say you know brother Jeff
[28:30] Good's
[28:31] coming not because that's our word but
[28:33] because he promised it you believe that
[28:36] amen I I think we need to shake
[28:37] ourselves tonight it seems like
[28:39] everybody's kind of uh uh a little tired
[28:43] and and uh w we we we should be in great
[28:46] expectation for things we got prayer
[28:48] requests but we got a god who's more
[28:50] than able to move on the scene for our
[28:52] brother Jeff and these these needs that
[28:54] have uh have been mentioned across the
[28:56] pole but let's just believe together
[28:58] we'll just ask brother Andrew to come
[29:00] and open our service in prayer why don't
[29:02] we all Stand
[29:04] Together intercede on behalf of these

[42:18] the hollow of his thigh and the hollow

[42:53] him and said tell me I pray thee thy
[42:56] name and he says wherefore is it that
[42:59] thou does ask after my name and he
[43:02] blessed him there and Jacob called the

[43:25] spirit tonight he actually sang the
[43:28] title of what I was going to speak on
[43:30] tonight I would like to speak on the
[43:32] face of God amen amen and um also uh uh
[43:39] we find here in Genesis chapter
[43:42] 32 it was like it was a preview in the C
[43:46] chapter of what was going to happen at
[43:49] the end time he was there at the face of
[43:52] God and we've seen on Sunset Mountain
[43:55] the face of God
[43:57] so I don't know if our brother can just
[43:59] project the face of God up there we can
[44:01] have a look and I believe that each and
[44:03] every one of us oh there it is each and
[44:05] every one of us have this picture in our
[44:07] home but what significance does this
[44:11] face of God have to us what meaning is
[44:15] there to the face of God and brother
[44:18] brandham actually expl uh
[44:20] describes what this picture was that
[44:24] this was absolutely the face of Jesus
[44:26] Christ
[44:28] and just to start off I'd like to see
[44:29] read a quotation from the message the
[44:31] rising of the sun he says remember I was
[44:35] preaching when this Vision Came Upon the
[44:38] subject of the Book of Revelations where
[44:41] the old judges where we see Jesus in
[44:45] Revelations 1 when we started to open
[44:48] the Seven Seals or the church ages
[44:50] rather just prior to the opening of The
[44:53] Seven Seals Christ was standing with
[44:56] head a like wool what and I describe
[45:01] that to you that the old English judges
[45:04] and judges of long ago when they went to
[45:06] the bench to be sworn in their supreme
[45:10] authority was given them they wore a
[45:14] white wig as it was over their heads to
[45:19] show their supreme authority amen so we
[45:23] have the Supreme judge of Heaven and
[45:26] Earth that has made his appearance here
[45:28] at the end
[45:29] time well the prophet says if you'll
[45:33] turn the picture like this and look you
[45:38] can probably see it from the
[45:41] audience it's
[45:43] Christ see his eyes year just as perfect
[45:48] as it could be wearing the white wig of
[45:52] supreme deity and the judge of all
[45:55] heavens and earth
[45:57] can you see his eyes his nose his mouth
[46:02] just turn the picture from this the way
[46:06] they had it this way the way it's
[46:10] supposed to be so the first time that
[46:13] they saw the face of Christ when the
[46:15] prophet turned the picture and he says
[46:18] that the picture of Christ God had his
[46:21] picture taken here at the end time amen
[46:24] can you see it he Supreme judge because
[46:27] there's none other but him and that is a
[46:30] perfect identification again of
[46:33] indication that this message is the
[46:37] truth amen it is true and making him not
[46:41] a third person but the only person see
[46:46] you see the dark his face his beard his
[46:51] eyes and notice he's
[46:54] looking from him comes this light so we
[46:58] see there's the face but from him I
[47:01] think I've got my little pointer
[47:10] here he says from
[47:14] him seems like it's not
[47:17] working oh it's the wrong way
[47:21] around anyway we see the face and then
[47:25] we see from the face comes the
[47:28] light so the picture is complete when it
[47:31] has the light in it amen so we see
[47:35] brother Bram now listen what the prophet
[47:37] says after this he's looking from him
[47:40] comes this
[47:42] light a shining on the right side to
[47:47] which he is looking to so that is a
[47:50] shining face The Shining face of God and
[47:55] on the cross that's where he looked
[47:56] looked to the right where he pardoned
[48:00] The Sinner on the light in the light of
[48:03] his resurrection we will still go forth
[48:07] in his name amen now the prophet says
[48:11] that Jacob he wrestled all night he
[48:16] wrestled until the change came so it was
[48:20] a changing
[48:22] dispensation it was changing of Jacob
[48:25] from a deceiver to were Prince with
[48:27] power before God and we find that it
[48:31] happened at the breaking of a new day
[48:33] yeah amen he said he said the angel said
[48:38] let me go the day is breaking he said I
[48:40] will not let you go until you bless me
[48:43] am see so we find Jacob's name was
[48:47] changed from an Earthly name and he was
[48:51] a deceiver Jacob means deceiver to a
[48:55] name given by God
[48:57] a name recorded in the Lamb's Book of
[49:00] Life and I think it's so fitting to the
[49:04] end time scripture of Revelation chapter
[49:06] 13 that the Beast that was to come upon
[49:08] the Earth shall deceive all those whose
[49:11] names were not written in the Lamb's
[49:14] Book of
[49:15] Life so all those whose names are not
[49:18] written will be deceived by the Beast
[49:20] system and we thank God Amen that we've
[49:24] seen our name Hallelujah
[49:27] so we find here in uh brother Bram says
[49:30] that Jacob cried in the message called
[49:34] desperation Jacob cried like never
[49:37] before desperately he called until he
[49:41] got a hold of God so this was not just
[49:45] an experience of having a
[49:48] sensation but this was a so changing
[49:52] experience he could never be a deceiver
[49:55] again it was the day when he experienced
[49:58] the rebirth the new birth in his
[50:00] soul he walked differently he spoke
[50:04] differently he came there as one person
[50:06] as the deceiver but when he left that
[50:09] experience he walked
[50:10] differently God Chang his walk God
[50:13] changed his talk he was now a
[50:15] manifestation of what God had in his
[50:18] mind God's word expressed for the hour
[50:22] and he wrestled with the angel he said
[50:25] yeah he wrestled to keep him in his soul
[50:28] see it was a soul experience and this is
[50:32] what the message of the hour does it's
[50:34] not a sensation but it's a soul changing
[50:38] experience you can never be the same
[50:40] again you can never go back to the world
[50:42] again because something has happened on
[50:45] the inside and this is the experience
[50:47] that Jacob had in the face of God and
[50:52] we've all had this experience when the
[50:54] face of God has appeared again here at
[50:56] the end time the same experience that
[50:59] Jacob had he said he was able to hold on
[51:03] until the blessing come he wrestled
[51:06] desperately until the blessing come then
[51:09] when he when he seen until God came on
[51:14] the
[51:15] scene and then in despair I'll not let
[51:18] you go when you begin to feel the
[51:21] blessing come down on him so he was not
[51:25] just uh
[51:27] happy with you know feeling maybe just
[51:30] the presence of God but he wanted a
[51:33] change a soul changing
[51:36] experience and this is what the message
[51:38] does to us change us from the inside out
[51:42] we're no longer what we used to be God
[51:45] has changed us we have been transformed
[51:48] into living images of the Living God see
[51:52] a lot of people say glory to God I got
[51:53] it now theyve they
[51:57] you're they you're deceived see somebody
[52:01] say oh I just feel so good brother
[52:04] brandham I went down there and prayed oh
[52:07] Shivers ran all over me and that might
[52:09] have been God I saw a great light before
[52:13] me that still might have been God but
[52:17] that ain't what I'm talking about
[52:19] there's got to be an inside
[52:21] change the Bible said in Hebrews the 6th
[52:24] chapter the rain falleth on the the just
[52:27] and the unjust just the same now you
[52:30] might take wheat and take weeds and put
[52:33] them in the field and the rain is
[52:35] actually sent for the wheat but the rain
[52:38] falls on the weeds the same as it does
[52:41] the wheat they'll make them rejoice and
[52:45] clap hands and do all kinds of things
[52:46] all the Motions but there's not a change
[52:50] and that's what we are looking for as we
[52:51] heard this morning that word is not
[52:54] going to become flesh in our flesh
[52:57] amen he says here and the rain and the
[53:00] weeds are just as happy about the rain
[53:02] as the wheat is and it's the very same
[53:05] rign the very Holy Ghost can fall upon
[53:08] an unbeliever and make him act just
[53:11] exactly the same way a Believer acts but
[53:14] by their fruits they are
[53:16] known that's what I'm talking about the
[53:20] token and Jacob rather in desp
[53:23] desperation he said I know I feel you
[53:26] you you are here with me but I'm not
[53:30] going to let you go until I feel the
[53:35] change and that's what we got to feel
[53:37] the change see somebody sees it fine the
[53:42] first little sensation they get up and
[53:44] jump up and down run up and down the
[53:47] aisle say I got it I got it I got it oh
[53:50] no see Jacob stayed there until
[53:53] something happened that made him walk
[53:57] different made him different person
[54:00] because that he stayed until that
[54:02] happened and the Bible said he held
[54:05] until he
[54:07] prevailed brother brandham says how can
[54:10] a man Prevail over God but you can do
[54:15] it you there in travail you're wrestling
[54:18] with God until you feel the change you
[54:22] can Prevail over God you leave with a
[54:25] blessing see you can do it a man can
[54:29] Prevail over God so this place where
[54:33] Jacob had this experience was called
[54:36] Pinel and in Hebrew it means the face of
[54:41] God and the name Jacob means a
[54:45] deceiver as brother brandham says he had
[54:47] run all of his life but when he got in
[54:49] the presence of God when he got in the
[54:53] face of God Jacob got a revelation
[54:57] of something that was real that's why we
[55:01] had an experience in this message that
[55:03] we have never known before we might have
[55:05] been in a church we might have been good
[55:07] churchgoers we might have been good
[55:09] worshippers and all those things but the
[55:11] change came when we were brought in the
[55:14] presence of the face of God see Jacob
[55:19] got a revelation of something and this
[55:22] Revelation that Jacob received allowed
[55:24] him to get a hold of God and once Jacob
[55:29] got a hold of God he held on he wouldn't
[55:33] let him go and from what Jacob was a
[55:37] deceiver he was now a manifested Son of
[55:41] God and you find the Propet said that
[55:43] Jacob held onto the face of God Jacob
[55:46] had a face tace experience with
[55:50] God that's why your face portrays
[55:53] certain
[55:54] qualities just by your face you know God
[55:57] could have shown his foot because the
[56:00] scripture says he put one foot upon the
[56:02] land and one upon the sea God could have
[56:04] shown a book that was open because
[56:07] remember the lamb he comes with an open
[56:09] book but why would he show his
[56:11] face there must be a reason why see and
[56:16] when one looks at the face it portrays
[56:19] certain uh qualities you know your face
[56:24] is your identification
[56:26] as we heard this
[56:28] morning it shows us who you are when you
[56:30] go to the bank you take your
[56:32] identification with you your ID card and
[56:35] they look at the card they look at your
[56:36] face the same person it's your
[56:39] identification see and we find that this
[56:42] is what they use to identify you that is
[56:45] why when the thief goes and rob the bank
[56:49] he covers his face so as long as he
[56:52] covers his face you will remain a
[56:54] mystery see this the secret lies in the
[56:58] face see and you find that your face
[57:01] reflects what goes on on the inside of
[57:04] you amen your face reveals your
[57:08] nature whether you are sick whether you
[57:11] are a mean person whether you are a kind
[57:14] person whether you are an arrogant
[57:16] person is all reflected on your face see
[57:21] your face also exposes who you are it
[57:25] gives away the the secrets of your
[57:27] hidden feelings whether you are happy
[57:31] whether you are joyful it shows what is
[57:35] hidden in your heart is reflected on
[57:38] your
[57:39] face your face also represents your
[57:43] personal presence your personal
[57:46] attention I could be standing here and I
[57:48] could be having a chat with brother
[57:50] Matthew you haven't got my personal
[57:53] presence my attention but once I show
[57:55] you my face then you have my personal
[57:58] attention amen and we find that that
[58:01] your face is also the most vulnerable
[58:05] part of your
[58:06] body that's how when two boxes are
[58:08] fighting you know you'll punch the body
[58:11] you'll try and we out his opponent but
[58:13] the actual last punch he gives you is in
[58:15] the face so the knockout punch comes in
[58:19] the face so we find that God revealed
[58:23] his most vulnerable part when the
[58:26] revealed us his
[58:28] face see he came now to reveal the
[58:32] hidden secrets that was hidden from the
[58:35] foundation of the world he's now come to
[58:39] reveal the Lamb's wife the marriage of
[58:42] the Lamb has come and his wife is now
[58:44] making herself ready he also came to
[58:46] reveal the mystery of the Rapture The
[58:49] Mystery of the seals the mystery of all
[58:51] these things amen when his face appeared
[58:55] on sunset
[58:57] Mountain and the face is also the most
[59:00] looked after part of a person if you
[59:03] want to hurt somebody say something
[59:05] about his
[59:06] face you know just say anything bad
[59:09] about his face but his nose or whatever
[59:12] amen it's the most look after part it's
[59:15] also the part which gets the most
[59:17] attention is the face you know put all
[59:21] the creams on there it must look nice
[59:22] and all these things see you must
[59:25] present yourself
[59:26] and here God Reveals His face to us so
[59:31] all the secrets there's nothing withheld
[59:33] anymore there's no veils or whatever so
[59:36] in other words when the ministers finish
[59:38] speaking he mustn't leave you with a lot
[59:39] of mysteries because all the veils has
[59:42] been unveiled all the secrets has been
[59:44] revealed we now look at him face to face
[59:47] amen so we find that the woman that
[59:50] laughed at the cloud
[59:51] picture which is the face of God the
[59:55] prophet said that was not nothing but
[59:58] blasphemy you know that picture of the
[1:00:00] cloud it's actually a supernatural
[1:00:02] picture it's a picture that cannot be
[1:00:05] tampered with you cannot put any other
[1:00:08] face into that face but that is the face
[1:00:12] of God himself you say well halfman's
[1:00:14] head of Christ it looks exactly the same
[1:00:17] but he doesn't look the same halfman's
[1:00:18] head of Christ is only an IM imaginary
[1:00:21] picture even though the prophet says you
[1:00:23] know it looks like him but brother says
[1:00:26] there are no artists that can paint the
[1:00:28] qualities of that face there's only one
[1:00:31] face like that amen the face of Jesus
[1:00:35] Christ amen so we find a mystery was
[1:00:39] revealed in the face of God and the
[1:00:42] prophet went West to meet one of his
[1:00:45] angels they the week form the face of
[1:00:48] God and he got the revelation of the
[1:00:51] seven seed says go back to
[1:00:53] Jeffersonville those Mysteries has been
[1:00:56] he will be revealed where did he get it
[1:00:59] in the face of God Amen that's why when
[1:01:03] we have that picture in our home it
[1:01:06] speaks of so many things you know as we
[1:01:10] will get to it right away and yet Jacob
[1:01:13] held onto the face of God in the
[1:01:15] personal presence of
[1:01:17] God until the breaking of a new day amen
[1:01:23] the Shalom rise Shine for thy light has
[1:01:27] come amen the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:01:30] upon thee the breaking of the new day
[1:01:33] was when the face was revealed unto us
[1:01:37] Allelujah and God said let me go the sun
[1:01:41] is rising but Jacob stayed in the face
[1:01:44] of God until it was Sun up until the
[1:01:48] breaking of a new day that's why we are
[1:01:50] out of denominational ages now we are
[1:01:53] now in the bright age we're now in the
[1:01:55] age of the Rapture at any moment the
[1:01:58] church could be gone we hear so many
[1:02:00] things of War even nuclear war we do
[1:02:03] anything out of Step you can press the
[1:02:05] the button and the atomic bombs will go
[1:02:08] could happen at any time so brother and
[1:02:10] sister we are living in an hour of
[1:02:12] rapture could have it even happen even
[1:02:15] before the sun rises tomorrow morning we
[1:02:17] are living in the hour that the
[1:02:19] generation that will see the rapturing
[1:02:22] of the church see so when Jacob left the
[1:02:26] face of God he was a changed man he
[1:02:30] probably walked as a you know real
[1:02:32] deceiver but when he left that place he
[1:02:35] started limping he walked differently
[1:02:37] why he had an experience with God and
[1:02:40] any man that has an experience with God
[1:02:43] your walk and your talk and everything
[1:02:45] there's a change about you why because
[1:02:48] you've been in the presence of God Amen
[1:02:52] so we find that Jacob went away with
[1:02:55] revelation
[1:02:57] await away knowing he was justified he
[1:03:00] could never be the same again something
[1:03:04] happened on the
[1:03:06] inside he went away knowing he could
[1:03:09] never deceive
[1:03:11] again that face-to-face experience with
[1:03:15] God brought Jacob Revelation and
[1:03:19] salvation amen he has seen the signs of
[1:03:23] God brother Braham says he had had the
[1:03:25] dream Dre of God but none of these could
[1:03:28] change
[1:03:29] Jacob amen we've been to the seven
[1:03:33] Church ages they've had all the signs
[1:03:35] and the Wonders and the wonderful
[1:03:37] experiences with God Pentecost I
[1:03:39] probably was the greatest but none of
[1:03:42] those things could bring the change but
[1:03:45] the day he had an experience on the face
[1:03:48] of God it was the day that ushered in
[1:03:52] the change that's why we know the change
[1:03:54] has come because God has shown his face
[1:03:59] see we find that there that was the time
[1:04:02] now we could walk as a manifested Son of
[1:04:05] God Jacob had obtained a victory in his
[1:04:09] soul and Jacob says in Genesis
[1:04:12] 32:3 I have seen God face to face and my
[1:04:17] life is
[1:04:18] preserved you know what the word
[1:04:20] preserved means it means to maintain in
[1:04:23] its original condition
[1:04:26] and that's how we know who we are we
[1:04:28] were always Sons and Daughters of God
[1:04:31] Amen and this experience has brought to
[1:04:34] us our true identity of who we really
[1:04:37] are amen you in the mind of God Amen
[1:04:41] waiting for the hour of manifestation so
[1:04:43] it was a thought and the thought became
[1:04:46] a word and the Word was spoken by the
[1:04:48] prophet and here we sit tonight the
[1:04:51] manifested thoughts the word of God made
[1:04:54] flesh today
[1:04:56] Hallelujah so we find that what God
[1:05:01] originally intended Jacob to be God
[1:05:04] didn't intend him to be a deceiver
[1:05:07] neither did did he intend you to be the
[1:05:09] person that you were before your
[1:05:12] salvation because the germ of life was
[1:05:14] on the inside the real you was on the
[1:05:17] inside waiting for the quickening
[1:05:20] waiting to come into the presence of the
[1:05:22] Living God which gerti the seed then the
[1:05:25] real you came into manifestation you can
[1:05:28] testify you can sing to the glory of God
[1:05:30] you can Minister the word of God the
[1:05:33] real you has now come to manifestation
[1:05:35] Hallelujah you testify of the goodness
[1:05:37] of God Amen Hallelujah as the song goes
[1:05:41] you know I will sing of the goodness of
[1:05:43] God Amen you can look back you can see
[1:05:45] where the Lord has brought you through
[1:05:47] to what you are today it's the grace of
[1:05:50] almighty God Amen so what happened on
[1:05:53] that day he wrestled at the face of God
[1:05:56] Pinel he wrestle with God until the
[1:05:59] change come a
[1:06:01] lifechanging
[1:06:03] revelation that's why you know it's not
[1:06:05] a matter of joining the message or just
[1:06:08] following the message but this is a
[1:06:10] lifechanging experience you realize that
[1:06:13] you are now a son and a daughter of God
[1:06:15] that within you there's a a supernatural
[1:06:18] element which indwells your mortal body
[1:06:21] you're no longer yourself anymore you're
[1:06:23] now a son and a daughter of God
[1:06:27] hallelujah so we find that amen I just
[1:06:30] want to go a bit F faster because I
[1:06:32] realize we have something else
[1:06:34] afterwards so now the change came also
[1:06:40] when Moses was in the presence of God
[1:06:44] now let's read the word of e the book of
[1:06:46] Exodus 34:
[1:06:48] 32-35 and afterwards all the children of
[1:06:51] Israel came nigh and he gave them in
[1:06:53] commandment all the Lord Lord had spoken
[1:06:56] with him in Mount
[1:06:58] Si until Moses had done speaking with
[1:07:01] them he put a veil on his
[1:07:05] face but when Moses went in the Lord to
[1:07:09] speak with him he took the veil off
[1:07:12] until he came out and he came out and
[1:07:14] spake unto the children of Israel that
[1:07:18] which was
[1:07:19] commanded and the children of Israel saw
[1:07:22] the face of Moses that the skin of his
[1:07:24] face sh sh and Moses put a veil upon his
[1:07:28] face again until he went in to speak
[1:07:32] with them brother BR says Moses went
[1:07:34] into the pillar of fire where he got the
[1:07:37] word of the Lord and when Moses came out
[1:07:39] that wasn't Moses anymore that was God
[1:07:42] and when he put the veil of his face it
[1:07:44] was Moos was was actually Moses putting
[1:07:46] a veil over God's face for that
[1:07:48] generation he covered his face in other
[1:07:52] words the mystery for that day was made
[1:07:53] known to Moses and he had to Veil while
[1:07:56] it was still in he was God but once he
[1:08:00] spoke the word he was Moses again and
[1:08:03] what happened he took the veil of his
[1:08:06] face amen this all got to do with the
[1:08:09] face Hallelujah so we find
[1:08:13] that uh brother brandham says that every
[1:08:16] motion that Moses did before the burning
[1:08:20] bush it was a type of Christ he said the
[1:08:24] rod that turned into a ser serent it
[1:08:26] typed sin already judged the Brazen
[1:08:30] serpent that was lifted up in the
[1:08:31] wilderness typed Christ being lifted up
[1:08:34] upon the cross of
[1:08:36] Calvary and the right hand had turned
[1:08:38] into white leprosy in its Advanced stage
[1:08:42] the moment Moses put that right hand
[1:08:44] into his bosom pulled it out it was
[1:08:47] instantly
[1:08:49] healed and when Jesus died on Calvary
[1:08:52] amen when he said it is finished that
[1:08:54] moment the sin question was dealt with
[1:08:56] you could now come and get the
[1:08:58] Forgiveness of your sin and here we find
[1:09:02] Moses face we saw the staff we saw his
[1:09:06] hand but now the face he typed the face
[1:09:10] of God it meant the living presence of
[1:09:14] God was with
[1:09:15] him amen so we find that on Sunset
[1:09:20] Mountain The Shining face of God
[1:09:23] appeared what was it we never received a
[1:09:26] visitation from Kentucky we had a
[1:09:29] visitation from Heaven God came and
[1:09:32] appeared in our midst Hallelujah we find
[1:09:38] that Moses shining shining face type the
[1:09:42] face of God now what does The Shining
[1:09:45] face of God means in
[1:09:48] Scripture that shining face of God means
[1:09:51] the living presence of God and with a
[1:09:55] living presence of God it brings the
[1:09:58] blessings of God and with the blessings
[1:10:01] of God comes Revelation it comes
[1:10:04] Redemption comes
[1:10:06] salvation on Sunset Mountain was The
[1:10:09] Shining face of God he was now coming
[1:10:13] with the secrets of redemption it was
[1:10:15] the living presence of God coming to us
[1:10:17] here at the end time amen now I just
[1:10:20] like to read some scriptures pertaining
[1:10:22] to The Shining face of God you see it's
[1:10:26] all in the scripture what God has done
[1:10:29] in this day takes us back to the Bible
[1:10:32] in Numbers Chapter 6 and verse 24
[1:10:35] whenever a blessing was pronounced over
[1:10:37] the children of Israel listen how it was
[1:10:40] done the Lord bless thee and keep Thee
[1:10:45] the Lord make his face to shine upon
[1:10:47] thee and be gracious unto thee so
[1:10:51] brother and sisters the face of God has
[1:10:53] Shone upon us we are a blessed people
[1:10:58] upon the Earth God has looked down upon
[1:11:01] us listen what he said the Lord lift up
[1:11:04] his countenance upon thee and give thee
[1:11:09] peace his face his countenance has been
[1:11:12] lifted up upon us the prophet says that
[1:11:16] was our Lord up
[1:11:18] there amen you think brother and sister
[1:11:21] that we had a visitation from God
[1:11:25] God has come to to to to to reveal his
[1:11:29] word at the end time now brother
[1:11:31] brandham says God doesn't leave his word
[1:11:33] to be interpreted by
[1:11:35] man his word is of no private
[1:11:37] interpretation God makes a promise and
[1:11:40] he comes and manifest the promise who
[1:11:43] could manifest Luke
[1:11:45] 17:30 Revelations 10 the Lord himself
[1:11:49] had to come to make these words real to
[1:11:52] us amen
[1:11:55] says the Lord lift up his countenance
[1:11:57] upon thee and give thee peace and they
[1:11:59] shall shall put my name upon the
[1:12:02] children of Israel and I will bless them
[1:12:07] we are a blessed people tonight see we
[1:12:11] find in in Psalms
[1:12:13] 31 we find that his face shines and
[1:12:17] brings
[1:12:18] salvation he says here in Psalms 31:1
[1:12:22] 15 my times are in thy hand
[1:12:26] deliver me from the hand of my enemies
[1:12:29] and from them that persecute
[1:12:32] me make thy face to shine upon thy
[1:12:35] servant save me for thy Mercy's sake
[1:12:40] with The Shining face of God comes
[1:12:42] salvation so salvation has come to us
[1:12:45] through the message of the
[1:12:48] hour and Psalms 80:3 turn us again oh
[1:12:52] God and cause thy face to shine and we
[1:12:55] shall be
[1:12:58] saved see a desire that the face of God
[1:13:02] must shine and what a blessing we have
[1:13:05] what a privilege that we have that the
[1:13:07] face of God has shown Upon Us brought
[1:13:11] salvation to us in the hour of
[1:13:14] Darkness Psalms 8:4 and the Lord of God
[1:13:18] of hosts how long will thou be angry
[1:13:20] against the prayer of thy people thou
[1:13:23] Feed Us them with the bread of tears and
[1:13:25] giveth them tears to drink in great
[1:13:27] measure thou makest us a Strife unto our
[1:13:31] neighbors and our enemies love amongst
[1:13:34] themselves 18 ver7 turn us again oh god
[1:13:38] of hosts and cause thy face to shine and
[1:13:41] we shall be
[1:13:43] saved they always desired to have the
[1:13:47] face of God to shine upon them you think
[1:13:51] brother we would ask for it but he came
[1:13:53] anyhow with his great Plan of Salvation
[1:13:56] for the bridey at the end
[1:13:58] time and here Psalms 8:17 let thy hand
[1:14:02] be upon the man of thy right hand upon
[1:14:05] the son of man whom thou mest strong for
[1:14:07] thyself so will not we go back from thee
[1:14:11] Quicken us and we will call upon thy
[1:14:14] name turn us again O Lord of hosts cause
[1:14:20] thy face to shine upon us and we shall
[1:14:24] be saved
[1:14:26] so when you see that picture of the
[1:14:27] cloud picture in your home it's your
[1:14:30] salvation in This Day Psalms 119 verse
[1:14:35] 1-5 you find it also brings Heavenly
[1:14:39] divine revelation the face of God make
[1:14:43] thy face to shine upon us and teach me
[1:14:47] thy statutes how does God teach by
[1:14:50] Revelation he reveals himself to you in
[1:14:54] Psalm 67
[1:14:55] verses 1-2 we find both salvation and
[1:14:59] Revelation to the chief musician in
[1:15:02] negano a Psalm or a song God be merciful
[1:15:06] unto us and bless us and cause his face
[1:15:10] to shine upon
[1:15:12] us that thy way may be known or revealed
[1:15:16] upon the Earth thy saving Health among
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:22] Nations amen there's no question that
[1:15:24] this message is the truth the face of
[1:15:27] God has shined Upon Us in Ecclesiastes 8
[1:15:32] verse one we find that Revelation makes
[1:15:37] a man's face to
[1:15:39] shine see Revelation a wise man is a man
[1:15:44] that knows the secret he knows the
[1:15:48] answer Ecclesiastes 81 who is as a wise
[1:15:52] man who knoweth the interpretation of a
[1:15:57] thing a man's Wisdom maketh his face to
[1:16:02] shine that's why he came with a shining
[1:16:04] face because he had the Revelation the
[1:16:06] Seven Seals had to come forth yes he
[1:16:09] brought the mysteries of God all the
[1:16:11] secret of redemption that's what the
[1:16:14] scripture says but in the days of the
[1:16:15] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:16:18] begin to sound the mysteries of God
[1:16:20] should be finished why because the face
[1:16:23] of God has shun
[1:16:25] H
[1:16:26] Allelujah and in finally in the time of
[1:16:28] Daniel when Israel's time was up the
[1:16:31] prophet prayed for Mercy he says in
[1:16:34] Daniel
[1:16:36] 9:17 now therefore Oh Our God hear the
[1:16:40] prayer of thy servant and his
[1:16:42] supplications and cause thy face to
[1:16:45] shine upon thy
[1:16:48] Sanctuary that is desolate for the
[1:16:50] Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear
[1:16:53] and hear open thine eyes and behold our
[1:16:57] desolation and the city which is called
[1:16:59] by thy name for we do not present our
[1:17:02] supplications before thee for our
[1:17:04] righteousness but for thy great
[1:17:07] mercies had a prayer Lord make your face
[1:17:11] to
[1:17:12] shine you think how blessed we are that
[1:17:15] we have The Shining face of God shining
[1:17:17] upon us we find another place in Matthew
[1:17:20] chapter
[1:17:21] 17:2 when he was revealing the order of
[1:17:25] his coming to bring Salvation both to
[1:17:28] Jew and Gentile in verse 17 verse1 and
[1:17:33] of the sixth day Jesus taketh Peter
[1:17:35] James and John his brother and bringeth
[1:17:39] them up into a high mountain
[1:17:42] apart and was transfigured before them
[1:17:46] and his face did shine as the
[1:17:49] sun and his reignment was white as light
[1:17:53] and behold the appeared unto them Moses
[1:17:57] and Elias talking with him amen as you
[1:18:03] all know that Elias was the ministry of
[1:18:06] Elijah that was to come to the Gentiles
[1:18:09] to our hearts to the faith of the
[1:18:11] fathers Jew Moses represented the law
[1:18:15] afterward he comes to the Jew he also
[1:18:17] represented the resurrected Saints and
[1:18:20] the dead Saints Hallelujah and how did
[1:18:23] it come by Shining face upon the
[1:18:27] mountain
[1:18:29] Hallelujah God does every time he does
[1:18:32] the same thing he's the same yesterday
[1:18:35] today and
[1:18:36] forever and here we find in Revelations
[1:18:39] 10 verse 1 at the breaking of the seven
[1:18:43] seal and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:18:45] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:18:48] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[1:18:51] face was as it were the Sun
[1:18:55] it's a shining face see and his feet as
[1:18:59] pillars of fire see that was the coming
[1:19:02] of the Lord for the opening brother
[1:19:04] Braham says Revelation 10 is the opening
[1:19:07] of The Seven seal that is the spirit
[1:19:10] coming of Christ the descending of the
[1:19:12] logos of God the Lord himself descending
[1:19:16] first Thessalonians says and the Lord
[1:19:18] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:19:21] shout with a voice of the archangel and
[1:19:24] the Trump of God and brother Bram says
[1:19:27] he does all these three in his
[1:19:30] descending and the shout is the living
[1:19:32] bread of life bringing forth a bride you
[1:19:36] are here because of the shout message
[1:19:39] the living bread of life Christ amen the
[1:19:42] Lord himself in our midst manifesting
[1:19:45] the L their promises Hallelujah there's
[1:19:48] never been a day like this day there
[1:19:51] never been a light that shines so bright
[1:19:53] as this glorious light
[1:19:55] the light of his glorious coming see and
[1:19:58] here we find as Moses came from the
[1:20:01] burning bush he hid the glory of God now
[1:20:04] the glory of God is the word in human
[1:20:07] flesh amen and we find he at was the
[1:20:11] word was in the prophet for that age and
[1:20:16] the face of Moses shine because of the
[1:20:20] word that was in him and as Moses had to
[1:20:23] put a veil over his face because they
[1:20:26] could not set for was he look at The
[1:20:28] Shining face of Moses which represented
[1:20:32] the face of God but when Moses dropped
[1:20:35] the Veil The Mysteries were revealed
[1:20:38] that was revealed in the pillar of fire
[1:20:42] amen that's why Moses was a type of
[1:20:45] Christ through seven Church ages Christ
[1:20:49] was revealed was
[1:20:51] veiled amen until the the word came at
[1:20:55] the end time and when you appeared on
[1:20:57] Sunset Mountain he had no Veil why all
[1:21:01] the Mysteries has been revealed the
[1:21:04] horse riders and all these things has
[1:21:07] been made known amen so we find brother
[1:21:11] and sister that uh brother Braham says
[1:21:15] here Moses had the word now remember
[1:21:18] after the word was made manifest Moses
[1:21:21] was Moses
[1:21:23] again but while that word was in him to
[1:21:26] be give out he was
[1:21:29] God for he wasn't Moses no more he had
[1:21:33] the word of the Lord for that age
[1:21:35] nothing could touch him till that was
[1:21:37] over he had the word in him so therefore
[1:21:41] when he come the people turned their
[1:21:43] heads they couldn't understand he'd been
[1:21:47] changed he was a different fellow he
[1:21:49] came with the word and he put the veil
[1:21:52] the Bible said over his
[1:21:55] face God covered his face in his Prophet
[1:22:00] see he had veiled so God veiled himself
[1:22:02] in Moses and gave Moses the word and
[1:22:05] Moses came down and spoke the word of
[1:22:07] the Lord see in a veil over his face
[1:22:12] that's right Jehovah veiled in the form
[1:22:15] of a prophet and that's how he appeared
[1:22:18] at the end time Jehovah veiled in the
[1:22:21] form of a prophet the prophet had been
[1:22:24] in the Pillar of Fire amen and he was
[1:22:26] now the veil speaking what was later to
[1:22:29] be placed behind other veils amen he was
[1:22:33] speaking a bride there was no bride but
[1:22:35] he spoke the bride into manifestation
[1:22:38] let there be a bride there will be a
[1:22:40] bride there will be a Rapture amen why
[1:22:44] cuz God said it amen the word has gone
[1:22:48] forth so no matter what happens it must
[1:22:51] manifest he says he said let there be
[1:22:53] light could thousands of years but
[1:22:56] because the word was spoken that light
[1:22:58] had to come forth amen he said there
[1:23:01] will be a bride no matter what happens
[1:23:03] the bride will be there there will be a
[1:23:06] Rapture
[1:23:07] Hallelujah see he had veiled God veiled
[1:23:11] him in Moses and Moses came down and
[1:23:14] spoke the word of the Lord in a veil
[1:23:17] over his face that's right Jehovah
[1:23:19] veiled in the form of a prophet and God
[1:23:22] said he wouldn't speak to them like that
[1:23:24] anymore he would only speak to them by a
[1:23:28] prophet that's the only way he ever
[1:23:31] speak from then on in other words it was
[1:23:34] God speaking again when the prophet
[1:23:36] comes it's God speaking to us see that's
[1:23:40] the only way that's the only way he ever
[1:23:43] spoke that's right never any other way
[1:23:46] see so it was today it was
[1:23:50] Jehovah veiled in a prophet William Bram
[1:23:54] was wasn't
[1:23:55] God although you can say it but you
[1:23:57] going to say it to the right
[1:23:59] Revelation amen he was the veil that God
[1:24:02] hid behind a son of man revealing the
[1:24:05] son of man he was the lust veiled be the
[1:24:08] veil of a man amen remember brother
[1:24:11] brandham says it was first uh uh Elohim
[1:24:15] the self-existent one he couldn't be
[1:24:18] seen But while he was in that form we
[1:24:20] were the attributes that were in him and
[1:24:24] from Elohim he became logos the visible
[1:24:27] form of God and from the logos he came
[1:24:30] human flesh amen and he was in the
[1:24:34] process of now restoration to bring back
[1:24:37] what was lost in Eden and while he was
[1:24:39] in that virgin born he had to die a
[1:24:41] death upon the cross of Calvary so that
[1:24:44] that same logos that was now in him
[1:24:47] could come on the day of Pentecost and
[1:24:49] break itself up in the first church that
[1:24:53] started on the day of
[1:24:54] Pentecost amen it fell at NAIA Rome but
[1:24:58] after 2,000 years that puf fire is back
[1:25:02] again amen he said he'll turn the hearts
[1:25:05] of the children to the faith of the
[1:25:08] fathers back to that same experience he
[1:25:11] says Pentecost is not a
[1:25:14] denomination Pentecost is an experience
[1:25:17] the pillar of fire dividing itself again
[1:25:20] we are attributes of this great logos
[1:25:22] that has come here at the end time
[1:25:25] amen see so we find here
[1:25:32] that when Christ appeared on Sunset
[1:25:34] Mountain there was no Veil why no more
[1:25:38] Mysteries all the Mysteries are
[1:25:42] revealed amen somebody cannot come and
[1:25:45] say well could it be this or could it be
[1:25:46] that no we speak why because the whole
[1:25:51] word has been open before us amen
[1:25:54] there's no Veil anymore amen we are now
[1:25:57] inside the veil of the of the presence
[1:25:59] of God living of the Hidden manner
[1:26:03] hidden from the foundation of the world
[1:26:05] the secret things of God he says here in
[1:26:08] 2 Corinthians the scripture says that
[1:26:10] the veil is taken from the face of
[1:26:13] Christ in 2 Corinthians
[1:26:15] 3:12 seeing then that we have such hope
[1:26:19] we use great plainness of
[1:26:22] speech and not as Moses which put a veil
[1:26:26] over his
[1:26:27] face that the children of Israel could
[1:26:30] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:26:34] which is abolished which is the law amen
[1:26:39] but their minds were blinded that's
[1:26:41] Israel for until this day the same Veil
[1:26:46] untaken away in the reading of the Old
[1:26:50] Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:26:53] Christ
[1:26:54] remember when he died the veil of the
[1:26:58] temple was ripped from top to the bottom
[1:27:01] and brother Bram says God unveiled the
[1:27:03] true Mercy Seat amen it was Christ
[1:27:05] hanging upon the cross of Calvary amen
[1:27:09] the true Mercy he came into view see but
[1:27:13] their minds were blinded the same Veil
[1:27:14] untaken away in the reading of the Old
[1:27:16] Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:27:19] Christ but even unto this day when Moses
[1:27:22] is read the Veil is upon their heart you
[1:27:26] know they say so much about Israel but
[1:27:29] they are a nation with a
[1:27:31] promise they are a nation amongst all
[1:27:34] the nations of the world that God has
[1:27:36] chosen to be his people and they've
[1:27:39] always been a rejected Nation amen but
[1:27:43] there are a people with a promise
[1:27:45] Messiah is going to be revealed to them
[1:27:48] Moses and Elijah is going to still
[1:27:49] minister to them amen but it cannot
[1:27:52] happen while the bride is still on the
[1:27:53] Earth
[1:27:54] and we living right at that transition
[1:27:57] time it could happen at any time you
[1:28:00] know you three repeats
[1:28:01] yourself remember when Jesus was upon
[1:28:04] the Earth he says when you see the
[1:28:05] armies gathered around
[1:28:08] Jerusalem he says head for the
[1:28:11] heels amen head for the heels you are in
[1:28:15] trouble and now we see the armies again
[1:28:18] gathering around
[1:28:20] Jerusalem and brother brandham says that
[1:28:22] Israel is God time pleas so if Israel is
[1:28:26] God's time pleas and the armies are
[1:28:28] gathering around Jerusalem how late are
[1:28:31] we it is later than we think brother
[1:28:35] brah says don't run to your denomination
[1:28:37] but run to Christ amen there's a place
[1:28:40] where you got to find a hiding place H
[1:28:44] Allelujah he says
[1:28:46] here
[1:28:48] nevertheless but even to this day when
[1:28:50] Moses is read the veil is upon their
[1:28:54] heart nevertheless when it shall turn to
[1:28:58] the Lord the veil shall be taken
[1:29:02] away when their heart is stand to the
[1:29:04] Lord the veil will be taken away they'll
[1:29:07] ask where do you get those cars they say
[1:29:10] in the house of my friends they realize
[1:29:12] the very one that they were waiting for
[1:29:13] he came and they were the one that
[1:29:16] crucified him amen but he said don't be
[1:29:19] angry with yourself God did this to
[1:29:21] preserve life if you hadn't blind them
[1:29:24] there would have been no Gentile bride
[1:29:27] but their blindness was the ushering in
[1:29:29] of the Gentile bride over seven Church
[1:29:31] ages but now our days are coming to a
[1:29:34] close amen the church ages it's over
[1:29:38] it's only the bride that has come
[1:29:40] because now the ministry is to the bride
[1:29:43] is to the elect the invisible Union of
[1:29:45] the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:29:47] bride who is this mlisc amen all these
[1:29:51] great promises is happening right here
[1:29:53] it's a Ministry not to denomination but
[1:29:55] now this is to the bride the seed of
[1:29:58] Abram receive your last sign last sign
[1:30:01] to the Royal seed of Abram what God did
[1:30:03] to Abram before the pr promise son came
[1:30:06] he does the same to the elect to the
[1:30:08] Royal seed of Abram before the promise
[1:30:11] un comes he's going to turn with his
[1:30:13] back to the congregation and he's going
[1:30:15] to start Discerning the heart of the
[1:30:17] royal seed amen it was that time when
[1:30:20] the promised son was on his way
[1:30:23] Hallelujah see so we find his hi his
[1:30:26] face has been
[1:30:27] hid his face was veiled Through the Ages
[1:30:32] but there had to come a time when the
[1:30:33] veil is lifted from the face of Christ
[1:30:37] the seals had to be broken because while
[1:30:40] the seals were still sealing The Plan of
[1:30:42] Redemption it was a veiled book but now
[1:30:46] the veils has been taken off the seals
[1:30:48] were broken now we can see what it's all
[1:30:52] about the whole plan of redemp
[1:30:53] Redemption has come into Plain View but
[1:30:57] brand says notice veiled in a human
[1:31:01] flesh Moses with that word speaking what
[1:31:05] was to be later put behind Badger skins
[1:31:09] so is Christ Our
[1:31:12] Moses Christ Our Moses he was God veiled
[1:31:16] in human
[1:31:17] flesh veiled in humanity in flesh that's
[1:31:22] right now this what the brother Bram
[1:31:23] says
[1:31:24] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:31:28] forever amen whenever he says that it
[1:31:31] means he's doing it right now he's the
[1:31:33] same what he's done in the past he's
[1:31:36] doing it right now and this time he was
[1:31:40] veiled in a man now notice the same
[1:31:44] yesterday today and
[1:31:47] forever promised word to this age he
[1:31:51] still Christ The Promised word for this
[1:31:54] age veiled in human flesh the word is
[1:32:00] God but you find that Paul in the Bible
[1:32:03] prophesied that the glory will be
[1:32:06] revealed in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:32:10] let's turn to the scripture in 2
[1:32:12] Corinthians 4:
[1:32:15] 3-6 but if our gospel be hid it is heed
[1:32:19] to them that are
[1:32:21] lost in whom the God of this world world
[1:32:24] that blinded the minds of them which
[1:32:27] believe not lest the light of the
[1:32:29] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:32:32] image of God should shine unto them amen
[1:32:37] this gospel is a Shining Light it has
[1:32:40] come to shine rise Shine for thy light
[1:32:43] has come the glory of the Lord is risen
[1:32:46] upon thee his glory shall be seen upon
[1:32:49] thee light has come to Quicken those GTI
[1:32:53] seed that was in God before the
[1:32:55] foundation of the world in whom the God
[1:32:57] of this world it says in verse four
[1:32:59] chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not
[1:33:04] ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:33:08] ourselves your servant for Jesus sake
[1:33:11] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:33:14] out of Darkness had shined in our hearts
[1:33:18] to give the light of the knowledge of
[1:33:21] the glory of God where in the face of
[1:33:26] Jesus
[1:33:28] Christ amen so there's so many things
[1:33:30] happening when the face appears I think
[1:33:33] we should be so excited so thankful to
[1:33:36] the Lord that his face has Shone upon
[1:33:39] us he says the light of the glory of God
[1:33:42] will be revealed in the face of Jesus
[1:33:45] Christ so when the veil is broken We
[1:33:48] Shall Behold that glory and by
[1:33:52] revelation
[1:33:53] behold that face and be changed into
[1:33:57] that same Glory from Glory unto Glory
[1:34:01] he's changing us from Mortal to
[1:34:04] immortality the Rapture is already in
[1:34:07] process we are just waiting for the body
[1:34:10] change amen hallelujah yeah in 2
[1:34:14] Corinthians 3:16 it says nevertheless
[1:34:18] when it shall turn to the Lord the veil
[1:34:21] shall be taken away now the the Lord is
[1:34:24] that spirit and where the spirit of the
[1:34:26] Lord is there is Liberty but we all with
[1:34:29] an open face beholding as in a dark as a
[1:34:33] in a glass the glory of the Lord are
[1:34:36] changed into that same image yeah from
[1:34:39] Glory unto Glory but BR said she is him
[1:34:44] she he was the word manifested she now
[1:34:47] becomes the word manifested she's bone
[1:34:50] of his bone she's Spirit of his Spirit
[1:34:53] she's life of his life she is him it's
[1:34:57] like Eve was taken out of Adam she is
[1:35:00] taken out of the second Adam amen she's
[1:35:02] part of his body she's a part of his
[1:35:04] bones Hallelujah Jesus in the form of a
[1:35:09] brine Allelujah so we find that his face
[1:35:12] speaks of his immediate presence and
[1:35:15] every attribute Son of God will enjoy
[1:35:18] his immediate presence when the veil is
[1:35:21] taken off the face of God
[1:35:24] I mean what a wonderful time we had this
[1:35:25] morning we could feel the presence of
[1:35:28] the Lord because of the word the
[1:35:30] anointing is upon the word he could move
[1:35:33] right across here good sense that the
[1:35:36] Lord was with us this morning at Sweet
[1:35:38] presence and me but s can be healed The
[1:35:41] Sinner can be saved you can receive your
[1:35:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can
[1:35:45] receive another touch from God why
[1:35:48] because he was present you know there's
[1:35:50] a song it says In The Presence of
[1:35:53] Jehovah
[1:35:54] God Almighty Prince of Peace U I don't
[1:35:58] know the words for the brother you know
[1:35:59] the word Sorrows
[1:36:02] vanish amen H Allelujah so as we behold
[1:36:06] his face we behold who he really is his
[1:36:09] person his character the mystery of his
[1:36:12] being will be revealed in his face amen
[1:36:17] his innermost Secrets will be revealed
[1:36:20] in his face when the veil is taken off
[1:36:23] when the the seals are broken and once
[1:36:26] again there will be a face t- face
[1:36:28] Revelation When We Shall Behold his face
[1:36:32] with the revelation of our
[1:36:33] identification now in him they are no
[1:36:37] longer Twain but they are one like
[1:36:40] husband and wife hallelujah amen flesh
[1:36:42] and spirit uniting together amen so
[1:36:46] through all the ages God in type only
[1:36:49] revealed himself his presence to his
[1:36:53] election
[1:36:54] yeah God was showing what he was going
[1:36:56] to do at the end time his presence come
[1:36:58] that's why the scripture says he that
[1:37:00] cometh to God must believe that he
[1:37:04] is you know now believe is to have that
[1:37:08] gift is that in that DNA in your soul
[1:37:12] from God to be able to believe his word
[1:37:16] must believe that he is in other words
[1:37:18] that he is
[1:37:20] real believe that he is a being you know
[1:37:24] that struck so so strongly when brother
[1:37:27] Bram mentions it he says God is a
[1:37:32] being he's not just something ose of
[1:37:35] light or air but he's a being he's a
[1:37:38] living
[1:37:40] reality and that being to conform of
[1:37:43] human flesh and when he died he rose
[1:37:47] again and the holy ghost is now with us
[1:37:50] in us he says I'll be with you
[1:37:53] even in you until the
[1:37:57] consumation
[1:37:59] Hallelujah so we find
[1:38:02] that
[1:38:04] people
[1:38:06] see so uh God was always identified in
[1:38:11] the midst of his people by his personal
[1:38:14] Presence by him being in their midst so
[1:38:18] what happened at the end time is
[1:38:20] scriptural it has always happened in the
[1:38:23] other the
[1:38:24] ages and we find Jacob
[1:38:27] called the name of the place Pinel for I
[1:38:31] have seen God face to face and my life
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:36] preserved and we find even Moses in that
[1:38:40] Exodus and it came to pass as Moses
[1:38:43] entered into the Tabernacle the Cloudy
[1:38:45] pillar descended and stood at the door
[1:38:48] of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked
[1:38:51] with Moses
[1:38:54] and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar
[1:38:56] so in other words he came and he spoke
[1:38:58] through a cloudy pillar so it wasn't the
[1:39:01] visible face that we've seen in our day
[1:39:04] but his face to face was him speaking to
[1:39:06] God in a cloudy pillar in a light in a
[1:39:10] burning bush because you find that even
[1:39:12] Moses desire to see the face of God God
[1:39:15] said but you will not be able to see my
[1:39:17] face no man can see my face and love you
[1:39:20] know but you can see my back he amen and
[1:39:24] here we see the face of God Amen he
[1:39:27] appeared to us we got our his picture in
[1:39:30] our in our houses in our rooms
[1:39:33] everywhere we have the face of God Amen
[1:39:36] he says
[1:39:38] yeah
[1:39:40] sorry he says and it came to pass as
[1:39:42] Moses entered the Tabernacle the Cloudy
[1:39:44] pillar descended and stood at the door
[1:39:46] of the
[1:39:47] Tabernacle and the Lord talked with
[1:39:50] Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy
[1:39:52] pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and
[1:39:55] all the people rose up and worshiped
[1:39:58] every man in his tent
[1:40:00] door and the Lord spake unto Moses face
[1:40:04] to
[1:40:05] face as a man speaketh unto his friend
[1:40:09] and he turned again unto the camp but
[1:40:10] his servant Joshua the son of nun a
[1:40:13] young man departed not out of the
[1:40:16] Tabernacle so we find that
[1:40:19] Israel God's chosen people saw God face
[1:40:24] to face still not the face to face that
[1:40:27] we have seen God they saw him in the
[1:40:29] pillar of fire but yet that face was the
[1:40:32] presence of God numbers 14:11 and the
[1:40:36] Lord said unto Moses how long will this
[1:40:38] people provoke me and how long will it
[1:40:42] be here they believe me for all the
[1:40:45] signs which I have showed them among
[1:40:47] them I will Smite them with pestilence
[1:40:50] and disinherit them and will make of
[1:40:53] Thee a greater nation and a mightier
[1:40:55] than they and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:40:59] then the Egyptians shall hear it for
[1:41:02] thou broughtest up this people in thy
[1:41:05] might from among them and they will tell
[1:41:08] it to the inhabitant of this land for
[1:41:10] they have heard that thou Lord art among
[1:41:13] this people that thou Lord art seen face
[1:41:17] to face and that thy Cloud standeth over
[1:41:21] them God always
[1:41:23] comes in his presence when he comes to
[1:41:26] deliver his people and he's done exactly
[1:41:29] the same here at the end time see that
[1:41:33] the cloud standed over them and that
[1:41:35] thou goest before them Day by time in a
[1:41:38] pillar of cloud and a pillar of Fire by
[1:41:42] night we find even that he spoke on the
[1:41:47] mount in Deuteronomy 52 and the Lord Our
[1:41:51] God made a covenant with us in horb the
[1:41:54] Lord made not this Covenant with our
[1:41:56] fathers but with us even us who are all
[1:42:00] of us here alive this day the Lord
[1:42:04] talked with you face to
[1:42:07] face in a moment out of the midst of the
[1:42:10] fire I stood between the Lord and you at
[1:42:13] that time to show you the word of the
[1:42:15] Lord for ye were afraid by reason of the
[1:42:18] fire and went not up to the Mount saying
[1:42:21] I am the Lord thy God which brought the
[1:42:24] out of the land of Egypt from the house
[1:42:27] of bondage today will say I am the Lord
[1:42:30] thy God that brought thee out of
[1:42:32] denomination that you may be a people
[1:42:34] unto him that you can walk in his
[1:42:37] presence see and Deuteronomy
[1:42:42] 3410 says There Rose not another prophet
[1:42:45] in the Old Testament who the Lord knew
[1:42:47] face to face let's read Deuteronomy
[1:42:50] 34:10 and There Rose not a prophet since
[1:42:53] in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord
[1:42:56] knew face to face in all the signs and
[1:43:00] the Wonders which the Lord sent him to
[1:43:03] do in the land of Egypt to pharaoh and
[1:43:05] to all his servants and to all the
[1:43:08] land but Paul in the New Testament he
[1:43:13] prophesied in 1 Corinthians 13:12 that
[1:43:16] the end time church will have a prophet
[1:43:19] that the Lord will speak to once again
[1:43:21] face to face let's read in 1 Corinthians
[1:43:25] 13:12 for now we see through a glass
[1:43:29] Darkly but then face to face that is now
[1:43:35] now I know in part but then shall I know
[1:43:39] even as also I am known amen you know
[1:43:44] him and you also know your
[1:43:46] identification amen that you were a part
[1:43:48] of him before the will began you were a
[1:43:52] part of his plan
[1:43:54] see so there will come forth a
[1:43:56] revelation and we shall know as we were
[1:43:59] known amen there will come a prophet
[1:44:02] again that will take the veil of the
[1:44:04] face of God and seven Thunders will
[1:44:07] utter their voices Amen to give the
[1:44:10] bride a revelation of how to enter into
[1:44:14] rapturing faith and here we find in
[1:44:17] Matthew
[1:44:19] 11:10 Jesus said let's read Matthew 11
[1:44:23] 10 for this is he of whom it is written
[1:44:26] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:44:30] face which shall prepare thy way before
[1:44:33] thee so John the Baptist was the one to
[1:44:37] come and identify and say Behold the
[1:44:40] Lamb of God he came to introduce the
[1:44:43] presence of God he was right there he
[1:44:46] was like all the common people but yet
[1:44:49] he was
[1:44:51] Emmanuel God With Us us and here John
[1:44:54] the Baptist says behold when the Dove
[1:44:57] came Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[1:45:00] away the sin of the world he foran the
[1:45:04] face of God and as John the Baptist
[1:45:07] foran his face brother Bram was sent in
[1:45:10] this day with a Ministry before the face
[1:45:12] again in 1933 in Ohio River the Lord
[1:45:16] said as John the Baptist was sent to
[1:45:18] forun my first coming he are sent with a
[1:45:21] message to forun the second coming of
[1:45:24] the Lord to unveil the coming lamb and
[1:45:28] the prophet was the first one to give a
[1:45:31] description of the face of Jesus Christ
[1:45:34] it's funny that everybody desired to see
[1:45:38] the face of God what a privilege we have
[1:45:42] we can look at the face of God Amen
[1:45:45] brother brah says yeah and seed is not
[1:45:47] air with a shock I kicked against the
[1:45:50] ground stomped my feet a little bit
[1:45:53] shook my head rugged my hands looked up
[1:45:57] again looked away looked again and there
[1:46:00] he was standing there and the wind
[1:46:03] started to blow and I seen the broom
[1:46:06] Sage blowing and when it started blowing
[1:46:09] his garments blew with it like the
[1:46:12] clothes hanging on a line they begin to
[1:46:15] flip he was standing there looking at it
[1:46:20] I thought if I could just get a look
[1:46:22] look at his
[1:46:25] face and he was watching
[1:46:28] East right this away he was watching
[1:46:32] intensely and I moved to step around to
[1:46:35] get a close look at his face and I still
[1:46:39] couldn't see very well and he had his
[1:46:42] hands in front of him rather hid from
[1:46:46] where I was
[1:46:48] standing I moved around again and I
[1:46:51] cleared my throat something like
[1:46:54] this to see if I could attract his
[1:46:58] attention but he never
[1:47:00] moved and then I thought maybe I'll call
[1:47:04] him when I said Jesus he turned his head
[1:47:08] and when he looked at me he just raised
[1:47:10] his arms out that's all I remember till
[1:47:14] nearly daylight I was laying right out
[1:47:18] here somewhere where this place is now
[1:47:21] in the field my pajama shirt all wet
[1:47:25] with tears where I'd been crying and I
[1:47:28] had passed out listen his face had
[1:47:32] characters that no artist could draw or
[1:47:37] paint they could not do it he looked
[1:47:40] like a man that if you would look at him
[1:47:44] you would cry with sympathy and respect
[1:47:48] with
[1:47:48] reverence and yet with enough power that
[1:47:51] he could speak and would turn the world
[1:47:54] all over and artist could never catch
[1:47:58] the characters that's how we should
[1:48:00] never put anything in that face of the
[1:48:03] cloud it's a supernatural drawing it's
[1:48:06] the face of Our Lord because brother
[1:48:09] Bram says here that no artist could
[1:48:13] paint the
[1:48:15] characters or could draw or paint that
[1:48:19] face Amen brother brah says I never know
[1:48:22] to this day what that meant but here I
[1:48:26] am tonight after 30 years standing in an
[1:48:29] auditorium that's dedicated now to the
[1:48:31] service of almighty God and me just a
[1:48:36] lay member really a local Elder in the
[1:48:38] Baptist Church here of which Roy Davis
[1:48:42] was pastor at the time and I'm now
[1:48:44] standing here with a place crowded right
[1:48:48] over the same grounds what I think is
[1:48:51] the purchase of the the blood of Jesus
[1:48:54] Christ himself in my hands to bring this
[1:48:57] four days message of the
[1:49:00] Lord H Allelujah do you love him
[1:49:03] tonight see brother bham was entrusted
[1:49:07] to reveal Jesus Christ that's why you
[1:49:10] had to know his face to know him what he
[1:49:13] looked like CU he was the messenger that
[1:49:16] was to run before his face you know in
[1:49:20] closing Moses desire to look upon the
[1:49:23] face of God in Exodus 33:18 he says I
[1:49:28] beseech thee show me thy
[1:49:31] glory and he said I will make all my
[1:49:34] goodness pass before thee and I will
[1:49:37] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[1:49:39] thee and I will be gracious to whom I
[1:49:41] will be gracious and will show Mercy to
[1:49:44] whom I will show mercy and he said thou
[1:49:48] can not see my face for there shall no
[1:49:53] man see me and love and here we have a
[1:49:56] big picture of his face you can look at
[1:50:00] his face a desire that the prophet Moses
[1:50:03] had a desire that the Saints of old had
[1:50:06] Lord if you can just look at your
[1:50:09] face and here we saw his face see and
[1:50:13] the Lord
[1:50:16] said behold there is a place by me and
[1:50:19] thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[1:50:23] shall come to pass while my glory passes
[1:50:25] by that I will put thee in the Cliff of
[1:50:27] The Rock and will cover thee with my
[1:50:30] hand while I pass by and I will take
[1:50:34] away mine hand and thou shalt see my
[1:50:37] back Parts but my face Thou shalt not
[1:50:41] see see that face was for a specific
[1:50:45] class of people for a specific a
[1:50:48] designated time was for our time for us
[1:50:52] to see that face than once the seals are
[1:50:55] broken now we can have a look at the
[1:50:57] face of God see if you throw it in Moses
[1:51:01] time we throw out the continuity of the
[1:51:03] scripture because that face can only
[1:51:05] appear once the veil is taken off amen
[1:51:10] that's why people Through the
[1:51:12] Ages they have longed to see the face of
[1:51:15] God they wrote songs about the face of
[1:51:18] God they wrote poems about the face of
[1:51:22] God
[1:51:23] but what a privilege that we've had that
[1:51:25] he revealed his face to us in this day
[1:51:29] one songwriter says what a day that will
[1:51:32] be when my Jesus I shall see when I look
[1:51:36] upon his face and tell the story saved
[1:51:40] by
[1:51:41] grace and there's another song it says
[1:51:43] Lord You're beautiful your face is all I
[1:51:48] see when your eyes on your child Your
[1:51:51] Grace AB bounds to me and then there's
[1:51:55] another song here it says yeah someday
[1:51:59] the silver cord will break and I no more
[1:52:03] as now shall sing but oh the joy when I
[1:52:07] shall Wake Within the Palace of The King
[1:52:11] and I shall see him face to face and
[1:52:15] tell the story Say by grace and I shall
[1:52:19] see him face to face and tell the story
[1:52:22] saved by grace it goes on Someday My
[1:52:26] Earthly house will
[1:52:28] fall I cannot tell how soon will be but
[1:52:33] this I know My All In All has now a

[1:52:48] Well done and I shall enter into rest
[1:52:53] someday till then I'll watch and

[1:53:01] bright that when my savior opens the
[1:53:04] gates my soul to him may take its
[1:53:08] fight and I shall see him face to face
[1:53:13] and tell the story saved by grace as it
[1:53:19] told this what's his name you know you
[1:53:22] can now you you get your robe and your
