[33:53] amen
[34:14] God bless you I'm really nervous I don't
[34:16] like giving testimonies
[34:18] but I just can't get this one off my
[34:20] mind so um I prayed last night and said
[34:24] God if I'm supposed to give it let me
[34:26] know and this morning it's like he was
[34:28] screaming at me
[34:29] so um
[34:32] I you might think it's trivial I I
[34:35] didn't think it was trivial at the time
[34:38] um y'all know Kristen my daughter she's
[34:40] got five children from 12 all the way
[34:43] down to one so she's got a lot of
[34:45] built-in
[34:46] babysitters and um Penelope wanted to
[34:49] watch Joseph Joseph is the
[34:51] baby um Penelope is
[34:54] 10 and so Kristen's like as long as you
[34:58] watch him she teaches them very well to
[34:59] watch them very
[35:01] closely so Penelope took Joseph upstairs
[35:04] and they were playing and about 10
[35:06] minutes later Penelope came downstairs
[35:09] screaming just frantic um she had seen
[35:13] Joseph put something in his mouth and
[35:16] she did her best to jump over there as
[35:18] quick as she could and sweep his mouth
[35:19] but she didn't get to him quick enough
[35:21] and she's like Mom I it was a push pin
[35:23] mom it was a push
[35:25] pin so Penelope was just devastated
[35:29] because she was
[35:31] responsible um so Kristen sent SOS
[35:35] please pray to the family and she took
[35:37] him to the emergency
[35:39] room and um can you put at that picture
[35:42] of
[35:44] Joseph so this is
[35:47] Joseph that's my youngest grand um he
[35:50] didn't know what was going on he just
[35:51] knew he was at the hospital having fun
[35:54] um so they did an x-ray and can you put
[35:57] put up the picture of the
[35:58] X-ray and if you look real close to the
[36:01] top I don't know if they can zoom in on
[36:02] there there's a push pin pushing into
[36:05] his esophagus pointing toward his
[36:09] heart so
[36:12] um they couldn't do anything for her at
[36:15] the hospital she was at so they said you
[36:17] have to go downtown that's where they're
[36:19] set up to operate on babies he's going
[36:21] to have to be operated on to get that
[36:23] push pin out of there well Scott her
[36:26] husband my son-in-law he was actually on
[36:29] call at that hospital they sent her to
[36:31] that night so she gets there and they're
[36:35] getting the doctor and everything and
[36:38] the doctor on call was the head
[36:40] pediatric surgeon from Children's Mercy
[36:42] Hospital in
[36:44] Phoenix um just as a fluke he happened
[36:46] to be on call that night he's like I I
[36:48] never go on call they just needed
[36:50] me so they took her in took him in for
[36:55] surgery and he said we have three
[36:57] options we're going to go in with a
[36:58] fixed uh
[37:00] endoscope and try to get it if we can't
[37:03] get that we're going to go in with the
[37:04] flexible endoscope and try to pull it
[37:05] out of his stomach and if that doesn't
[37:08] happen we'll come out and have another
[37:11] conversation so they went in and he came
[37:14] back out about 15 20 minutes later they
[37:16] had to put him under put a breathing
[37:18] tube down his throat all the kind of
[37:20] stuff you do when you're being operated
[37:22] on and he come out about 20 minutes
[37:24] later holding a push pin
[37:27] and um he had went down and literally
[37:30] grabbed it right off the bat out of his
[37:33] esophagus and uh we know it was God
[37:36] because that push pin could have kept
[37:37] going no telling what kind of damage it
[37:39] could have done
[37:44] um I just feel like I need to give
[37:46] praise to God for protecting my
[37:53] grandson huah
[37:58] amen let me say this it pays to be a
[38:01] Christian amen it pays to to have
[38:04] someone you can call on and you know
[38:06] that is there the present help in times
[38:08] of need amen we certainly praise our God
[38:12] for that
[38:14] amen Amen brother Shel vill
[38:17] writes would like to thank God for
[38:20] giving another year to Junior
[38:23] Ezekiel uh so want to wish him happy
[38:26] birthday
[38:28] uh sister Lesley write there's a signup
[38:30] sheet uh for dessert for uh lunch and on
[38:33] Saturday November 9th in the library and
[38:36] this is for our November meeting so uh
[38:39] don't forget it's about two weeks away
[38:41] from now and so we want to make all the
[38:44] efforts we can to attend and and
[38:47] everything and so we certainly
[38:48] appreciate that uh also brother Jose
[38:52] writes please pray for a friend who
[38:54] needs Deliverance so we want to uh lift
[38:57] up brother Jose's friend pray that the
[38:58] Lord will touch him amen so today uh
[39:01] don't forget we only have one service so
[39:04] today is a very special day am man how
[39:07] many knows
[39:09] that you know um you know I
[39:14] was I was thinking about just a pastor
[39:17] Brother David
[39:19] and you know there's so many things that
[39:23] about him that I can talk about and we
[39:27] probably won't have enough time but I
[39:29] just want to say this
[39:32] um the characteristics that God has
[39:34] built him with and is placed in him they
[39:38] hard to find many places then you know a
[39:41] man who's a selfless man who who doesn't
[39:45] put himself and he's not looking for
[39:48] Glory he's not looking for recognition
[39:51] or some form of
[39:53] reputation I there are very few pastors
[39:56] that really want you to know what the
[39:58] prophet said that's right most of them
[40:00] they'll try to be your interpreter you
[40:03] know every time you have a problem they
[40:05] they try to tell you what the prophet
[40:07] said and what he means and
[40:09] everything but he's one of those that he
[40:13] placed the message so that when he
[40:15] stands here he speaks we know what the
[40:18] prophet said we are in one Accord we are
[40:21] in one we are walking together you know
[40:24] I've always thought about brother bam
[40:26] says that you know a good shepherd He
[40:28] said smells like a sheep that's the
[40:31] qualification that's that's Brother
[40:33] David for you he he's not looking for
[40:36] Honor he's not looking to be known and
[40:39] he's just there and he's not afraid to
[40:41] walk alone when he sees something and
[40:45] God reveals a way to him and he goes you
[40:47] know there's often times he says things
[40:49] and I'm looking I'm like I have no
[40:52] idea but you patiently wait you
[40:55] patiently study the word you patiently
[40:57] God starts to open up and you see oh now
[41:00] I see
[41:01] that and and I want us to just show our
[41:04] love and appreciation you know today
[41:06] just make sure you know if you can just
[41:09] stop by and after service we only have
[41:12] one service so this afternoon at 400
[41:14] p.m. we'll have the meals that's
[41:16] prepared and you know so we can uh uh
[41:19] have something to eat and celebrate his
[41:22] birthday he's a quarter of a century old
[41:24] so we we really need to we don't want
[41:28] when he's gone for us to gather said you
[41:30] know then everybody comes and say how
[41:32] wonderful it was no I don't think so I
[41:35] think today is the day you take time and
[41:37] you just tell them how much we love and
[41:39] appreciate him a a man who's who's
[41:43] giving himself for this gospel so we can
[41:45] know within ourselves not through him
[41:49] but build the personal relationship with
[41:51] Christ amen so I'll invite brother
[41:54] Matthew to just come and say a word and
[41:56] take this before the Lord I just
[41:59] thought I wanted us to to be reminded
[42:02] this building that we are in it was
[42:04] because someone had a vision
[42:07] yeah someone gave of himself someone was
[42:10] moved by the Lord and he came and he
[42:12] pushed and and and and that's why we are
[42:15] here so let's just appreciate him and
[42:18] celebrate him
[42:21] today amen let's pray Lord how we love
[42:24] you we thank you that
[42:27] we have this opportunity Lord to bring
[42:29] these needs before
[42:31] you Lord
[42:33] there's many needs that are represented
[42:36] here that are
[42:39] unspoken Lord we know that you made a
[42:42] way for every single need Lord
[42:45] and by Faith Lord we're just resting in
[42:48] Your Word of
[42:49] Promise Lord
[42:52] that if we would ask anything in your
[42:55] name that you would Grant it Lord so
[42:56] we're just just lifting all of these
[42:58] needs up to you Lord and we're asking
[43:01] your blessings upon the tithes and the
[43:04] offerings Lord knowing that you'll
[43:06] reward those Lord that give as they take
[43:10] you at your word Lord we just committ it
[43:14] to you and ask these blessings in Jesus
[43:16] Christ's name amen amen praise the lord
[43:19] well today's a very special
[43:22] day a very special birthday as many of
[43:25] you know and maybe some of you don't
[43:28] know but this is also evans's fifth
[43:33] birthday and um yeah as me and brother
[43:36] Billy were talking and just thinking of
[43:37] something to say uh for Brother David I
[43:41] I couldn't help but get overwhelmed um
[43:44] and I won't uh for the sake of time I'll
[43:48] be very brief but you know it was a
[43:50] joyous occasion back in 2019 as I was we
[43:55] were going to give birth to
[43:57] Evan and it just so happened to be on my
[44:00] my dad's 70th
[44:02] birthday and there was some
[44:05] complications and you know
[44:09] um they lost Evan's uh heartbeat and all
[44:12] of a sudden that a voice came in and
[44:15] said what you thought was going to be
[44:17] joy and you thought you were going to
[44:18] mark your your father's 70th birthday
[44:21] with joy and the gift of a grandson is
[44:22] going to be a mark of death and all of
[44:24] these thoughts just started to pour in
[44:27] but then Faith
[44:29] anchored and said you know perfect love
[44:32] cast out
[44:34] fear and it was a a supernatural moment
[44:37] not to go into the story but God moved
[44:39] on the scene and brought forth a a
[44:42] healthy baby boy and I I was just
[44:44] thinking of of that as now um here we're
[44:48] celebrating our pastor's 75th
[44:52] birthday and you know in 1978
[44:57] this time of year he was 29 years
[45:01] old going to pack up a family and move
[45:05] to Bedford Texas to start a church and I
[45:09] read this quote uh this
[45:13] morning brother brandham said in Return
[45:15] in Jubilee I I was uh just listening to
[45:19] a sermon that our pastor had referenced
[45:22] that was on his heart and and I jumped
[45:24] out of that when brother brandham said
[45:26] something and caught this he goes goes
[45:27] to show What Faith Can Do I think if a
[45:30] person is ever sure in their heart and
[45:34] have something that faith can anchor on
[45:36] they should never
[45:39] cease no matter how many times they're
[45:41] defeated they should continue
[45:46] on Brother David has hasn't
[45:51] ceased uh there's been a lot of Trials a
[45:54] lot of
[45:54] hardship what would seem like many
[45:57] defeats but when you're sure of
[45:59] something can you imagine moving to this
[46:02] area in
[46:03] 1978 with without a church body in the
[46:07] Dallas Fort Worth area and sojourning
[46:10] and walking
[46:11] alone but when you're sure of something
[46:13] in your heart regardless of how many
[46:14] times you might fail no matter how many
[46:16] people walk away there's one thing he
[46:19] was sure of that God called him here to
[46:21] be a pastor and regardless of of number
[46:26] regardless of Tri Tri regardless of
[46:29] hardship there's one thing he had was an
[46:32] absolute and I believe that we can all
[46:34] testify that we see the fruits of What
[46:37] Faith Can Do and when you when you have
[46:40] an absolute just stay with that absolute
[46:42] which is the word of God and Faith's
[46:43] final resting place is the word and I
[46:47] say it's a special occasion this might
[46:49] be a little odd but I I just want to
[46:51] sing one of his favorite songs Joy is
[46:53] the flag flown high in the castle
[46:57] just in honor of him he loves that song
[46:59] we we actually sing that with um uh with
[47:02] our birthday songs but 75 years amen
[47:07] God's blessed my father your pastor and
[47:11] don't forget that this would have never
[47:13] been possible without sister lesie who's
[47:15] been instrumental in keeping him this

[1:00:05] any detail but anyway I'm sure she's a
[1:00:08] lovely girl and
[1:00:11] uh uh so uh we want to do that you know
[1:00:15] th this um message came on my heart and
[1:00:19] I I was looking for another um a message
[1:00:24] I was looking for or
[1:00:27] uh a message uh that's uh the way of a
[1:00:33] true
[1:00:34] prophet and that came on my heart and I
[1:00:36] thought you know the way of a true
[1:00:38] Prophet the way of something is the way
[1:00:41] it's done the way it goes you you know I
[1:00:44] mean how that it is and uh we should uh
[1:00:49] travel in in the way of a prophet but as
[1:00:52] I went to look for that book I came
[1:00:54] across this message
[1:00:56] not once but every time I go through my
[1:00:59] books there it would be out of order out
[1:01:02] of place you know here it was in in six
[1:01:06] uh in 62 and then it's over here and and
[1:01:10] everywhere I look this message came come
[1:01:12] up so it came in my heart and the name
[1:01:15] of the the sermon we're going to play 20
[1:01:17] minutes of it this morning is events
[1:01:20] made clear by prophecy amen events made
[1:01:25] clear by prophecy and I thought you know
[1:01:28] isn't that what everybody's wondering
[1:01:32] today what's going
[1:01:34] on what's Happening you know the the we
[1:01:39] know the world's falling apart sir you
[1:01:41] know it it you hear it over and over
[1:01:44] again it's crazy out there people are
[1:01:47] are are are are acting like we've never
[1:01:50] seen them act before and so all there's
[1:01:54] all kinds of events
[1:01:56] going on you know there's wars and
[1:02:00] rumors are Wars and there's uh
[1:02:03] pestilence and and it just it it causes
[1:02:07] you just to come to a place and then
[1:02:09] here's a beautiful message that says the
[1:02:15] events are made clear by prophecy
[1:02:20] amen and and the way that our messenger
[1:02:23] unfolds this is
[1:02:27] uh really amazing and and that's kind of
[1:02:32] what I I don't want us to miss as we're
[1:02:36] listening and he he he he makes so many
[1:02:41] references
[1:02:43] to reading your scriptures reading the
[1:02:47] scriptures that I think it should stand
[1:02:49] out to you and what he's trying to tell
[1:02:53] us to look for look look for what the
[1:02:57] Bible said would happen look for what
[1:03:01] the promises are of this day you know
[1:03:06] and so many times when we think of
[1:03:08] modern events we think of political
[1:03:12] events you know what I mean the what are
[1:03:16] the political events that are taking on
[1:03:20] uh we look to Israel we look to what's
[1:03:22] going on but there's a whole another
[1:03:25] event
[1:03:27] that taking place and that's in the
[1:03:29] spiritual
[1:03:31] realm and and and we don't want to miss
[1:03:34] that we want to be able to catch uh
[1:03:37] these great things and and I'll say this
[1:03:40] with all my heart I don't care how great
[1:03:42] a man can preach or how
[1:03:46] anointing it it is and Satan can pure as
[1:03:50] an angel of Light you cannot navigate
[1:03:54] The Hour That we live in without the
[1:03:58] leadership of Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 and
[1:04:03] Revelations
[1:04:05] 107 you know that's that is the guide
[1:04:10] that was sent by the Lord Jesus to guide
[1:04:14] his church and and we know that we serve
[1:04:19] one God we don't have him broke up into
[1:04:22] three pieces we serve one God and that
[1:04:26] one God has always manifested himself
[1:04:29] made himself known and he's making
[1:04:32] himself known in our
[1:04:35] day and I I hope that you can hear what
[1:04:38] the prophet says as we listen to it he's
[1:04:41] making himself known in this day as he
[1:04:45] makes the events of this day clear by
[1:04:50] the word of God
[1:04:51] Amen and I like to just read this one St
[1:04:55] statement is the brothers if you have uh
[1:04:59] something that you like to read along
[1:05:02] with your phone or take notes uh uh he's
[1:05:06] going to start in the book of uh uh uh
[1:05:11] in the Book of Luke the 24th chapter and
[1:05:15] I think the uh 12th verse so that's what
[1:05:18] we'll be turning to but he makes this
[1:05:21] statement he
[1:05:24] says the Bible
[1:05:27] he says for the Bible is a
[1:05:31] living
[1:05:32] foretold witness of Jesus Christ amen a
[1:05:38] living foretold
[1:05:41] witness
[1:05:43] the and he says the Bible is God's word
[1:05:48] for telling the future events so the bi
[1:05:53] the Bible is the living
[1:05:56] is is is a
[1:05:58] living for told witness of Jesus Christ
[1:06:04] so it's not something that we look back
[1:06:07] to you understand it's not something
[1:06:11] that we look forward to what we want to
[1:06:14] see is the
[1:06:17] living witness of Jesus Christ amen so
[1:06:22] the scripture tells us that he he that
[1:06:26] he's makes himself known in every age
[1:06:30] he's wound in to the word of God to
[1:06:34] reveal himself so in right in the this
[1:06:37] morning with us sitting here there
[1:06:40] there's events that are going on right
[1:06:43] now right here that are a living
[1:06:48] witness a a a a living witness to Jesus
[1:06:53] Christ and we're all a part of it amen
[1:06:57] and so we're a part of we're all a part
[1:07:00] of the events that are taking place
[1:07:03] we're all a part of what's being
[1:07:05] foretold but what we want to do is Lord
[1:07:08] give us isav that we might see we want
[1:07:12] to be able to open our hearts our minds
[1:07:14] our spirits that we can see the living
[1:07:17] events how that Jesus Christ is
[1:07:20] manifesting himself in our midst in this
[1:07:23] day and what it is that we should be
[1:07:26] looking for what it is that we should be
[1:07:29] aware of and
[1:07:32] how it is and what transpires that
[1:07:35] causes us to miss it and I I'm only
[1:07:40] going to play 20 minutes of this this
[1:07:42] morning but I trust that you'll go back
[1:07:46] uh and maybe finish the message or do a
[1:07:49] little bit of study in that but you we
[1:07:52] want the modern events or or or as we
[1:07:58] would say events made clear by prophecy
[1:08:03] amen so it's a two-way street right you
[1:08:06] got to see the event you got to see the
[1:08:09] prophecy and you got to be able to tie
[1:08:12] those things together so I trust this is
[1:08:15] a blessing to you I think it's extremely
[1:08:17] timely I I thought it was preached
[1:08:20] earlier in his ministry but really it
[1:08:22] was preached in August of 1965
[1:08:26] and I believe the Lord knew when he was
[1:08:28] going to take brother brandom from and I
[1:08:31] believe that the Lord knew
[1:08:33] what what word that he wanted to store
[1:08:38] up for this bride and and so every
[1:08:41] single one of these things has a
[1:08:44] significance and a time and I I really
[1:08:47] feel that we've all got to be a part and
[1:08:50] pray father let me see what the events
[1:08:54] are that are really happening not the
[1:08:57] political events not the newspaper
[1:09:00] events but the spiritual signs of your
[1:09:04] coming open my eyes to him so let's
[1:09:06] stand together this morning and we'll
[1:09:10] make a few comments at at after that we
[1:09:14] listen to uh this I think it's vital I I
[1:09:18] you know I believe it I I'm so thankful
[1:09:21] that so many of you stand with me uh on
[1:09:25] this of of playing the uh our Messengers
[1:09:30] uh word in the church and I think it's
[1:09:33] vital to us amen I I believe with all my
[1:09:37] heart I I believe that that uh brother
[1:09:41] renam was the voice of God to this
[1:09:45] generation and uh he wasn't just a man
[1:09:48] that God worked through he was a man
[1:09:52] that God spoke through that's right
[1:09:55] amen his relationship with God was
[1:09:58] different God spoke with him lip to ear
[1:10:01] fact so much in this day was God that
[1:10:06] was promised to us that the Lord Jesus
[1:10:10] himself would come back take on a veil
[1:10:15] in other words a covering and Veil
[1:10:18] himself hide himself in something that
[1:10:22] and and do the same works that he did in
[1:10:26] front of the Jews that he would do in
[1:10:30] front of the Gentiles he wasn't using
[1:10:33] the body body of Jesus that came 2,000
[1:10:37] years ago but he was using a special
[1:10:40] prepared body and our messenger made
[1:10:43] this statement there was no difference
[1:10:45] between the ministry of Jesus Christ and
[1:10:48] this ministry except the Corporal body
[1:10:52] amen amen and that
[1:10:55] deity veiled in flesh amen amen was
[1:11:00] brother
[1:11:01] brandham brother Bram was born in sin
[1:11:04] that's right shaped into iniquity he
[1:11:06] came into the world speaking lies he had
[1:11:09] to be converted he had to repent he had
[1:11:13] to be filled with the Holy Ghost but
[1:11:16] there was a special
[1:11:18] work that was designed and he was
[1:11:21] designed that God could come and fill
[1:11:25] him
[1:11:26] stand in our midst hid in his Corporal
[1:11:30] body doing and preaching the word to the
[1:11:34] Gentile Church Hallelujah and I know
[1:11:36] that's hard for a lot of people to
[1:11:38] swallow but I can't see it any other way
[1:11:41] and and and I just hope that you can
[1:11:44] understand why that I
[1:11:47] cling so much thank you Lord to this
[1:11:50] word cuz heaven and earth will pass away
[1:11:54] but this word will not pass away and I
[1:11:58] just trust that God would speak to you
[1:12:00] for a few moments this morning 20
[1:12:02] minutes let's listen as soon as he's
[1:12:04] done uh reading the scriptures we can be
[1:12:07] seated thank you I want to read a text
[1:12:10] here found over in the book of St Luke
[1:12:15] at the 24th uh chapter that I'm going to
[1:12:18] begin at the 13th verse and read a
[1:12:21] portion of it and we told two of them
[1:12:24] went the the same day from the village
[1:12:26] called emus which was from Jerusalem
[1:12:28] about three SC score forong and they
[1:12:31] talked together these things which had
[1:12:34] happened and it came to pass that while
[1:12:37] they communed together
[1:12:39] and Jesus himself Drew near and went
[1:12:43] with them but their eyes were Holden
[1:12:47] that they should not know him and he
[1:12:49] said unto them what manner of
[1:12:52] communication are these that you have
[1:12:55] one to another as you walk and are sad
[1:12:58] and the one of them whose name was Copus
[1:13:02] answered and said unto him art thou only
[1:13:04] a stranger in Jerusalem and how thou not
[1:13:07] known all these things which have come
[1:13:09] to pass in these days and he said to
[1:13:12] them what things and they said unto him
[1:13:14] concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a
[1:13:18] prophet Mighty in deed and word before
[1:13:22] God and all the people and how the chief
[1:13:24] priest priest and the rulers delivered
[1:13:26] him to the be condemned to death and
[1:13:29] have crucified him but we trusted that
[1:13:33] it had been he which should have
[1:13:35] redeemed Israel and besides all this
[1:13:38] today is the third day since these
[1:13:40] things were done yay and certain of the
[1:13:43] women also of our company made us
[1:13:46] astonished which were at the supper when
[1:13:49] they found not his body they came saying
[1:13:53] that it also seen a vision of angels
[1:13:56] which said unto them which said that he
[1:13:58] was alive and certain of them which were
[1:14:01] with us went to the sufferer and found
[1:14:03] it even so as the women had said but he
[1:14:08] they but him they saw not then he said
[1:14:11] to them oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:14:15] believe not believe all that the
[1:14:17] prophets have spoken ought not Christ to
[1:14:20] have suffered these things and entered
[1:14:23] into his glory and begin at Moses and
[1:14:26] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[1:14:29] all the scriptures the things concerning
[1:14:33] himself may the Lord add His blessings
[1:14:36] to the reading of his words now I take
[1:14:39] if I call it a subject i' like to take
[1:14:42] this that events modern events are made
[1:14:46] clear by
[1:14:48] prophecy now it's always been God's the
[1:14:52] unchanging God's uh way to
[1:14:57] for uh let his people for know before
[1:15:00] certain events happen if the people in
[1:15:03] the days of the Lord Jesus would have
[1:15:06] only sought God and know what was just
[1:15:09] about to take place they would not have
[1:15:12] condemned Jesus to death but the reason
[1:15:15] it was because the scriptures had to be
[1:15:17] fulfilled because the Jews had to be
[1:15:19] blind and we all are aware of that do
[1:15:22] you realize that that's promised again
[1:15:24] in this very age that we're living the
[1:15:27] lady of sin Church age this seventh
[1:15:29] Church age that we're in now is naked
[1:15:32] miserable blind and don't know it the
[1:15:36] same as he blinded them back there for
[1:15:38] the purpose of getting his message
[1:15:41] through to the elected people he's
[1:15:43] promised to do the same thing today and
[1:15:46] if I'd say this to respects to all my
[1:15:49] brethren and Sisters in
[1:15:52] Christ one of these days somebody's
[1:15:54] going to say isn't it written that these
[1:15:55] things should happen first and it'll be
[1:15:57] the same way it was and verely I say
[1:15:59] unto you he's already come and they have
[1:16:02] did what they listed to him when they
[1:16:05] asked him said well the scribes say and
[1:16:07] the scriptures say that that Elias must
[1:16:09] first come and said that to Jesus he
[1:16:11] said he's already coming you didn't know
[1:16:13] him and that's perhaps the way it'll end
[1:16:16] up again now we want to be psted to know
[1:16:19] what's to take place for this age that
[1:16:21] we live in God has lotted his word to to
[1:16:25] each age so much to each age and we must
[1:16:28] notice that one age cannot carry over
[1:16:30] into another age it just won't work for
[1:16:34] instance as I set up leave last night or
[1:16:37] constantly speaking night after night
[1:16:39] places and sometimes I make the remark
[1:16:41] the second time I don't mean to repeat
[1:16:43] myself but I say this what would good
[1:16:46] would it have done Moses to try to
[1:16:48] preach Noah's message for what good
[1:16:51] would have been would have done Jesus to
[1:16:53] try to preach Moses message or what good
[1:16:56] would have done Martin Luther to
[1:16:58] continue on with the Catholic message
[1:17:01] what good would have done Wesley to
[1:17:02] continue on with the Lutheran message
[1:17:05] what good would have done Pentecostal to
[1:17:07] continue on with the Methodist message
[1:17:10] or what good will it do Pentecost to
[1:17:12] continue on when the bride's being
[1:17:15] called we're right up into the seed
[1:17:19] time we're here at the end time unless a
[1:17:23] corn of wheat falls to the Earth that
[1:17:25] abides alone as a Critic as I made
[1:17:27] remarks that's the book come out
[1:17:29] probably you got it you're in your your
[1:17:31] city that German author that wrote one
[1:17:34] of the most critical articles is the
[1:17:36] Infidel course not I'm not condemning
[1:17:39] him because he's condemned me so but
[1:17:41] because being an Infidel the book should
[1:17:44] never be on the shelves and he said a
[1:17:47] God that could set up and
[1:17:49] say I think we got the tapes mixed up
[1:17:52] Brothers I'm sorry the one that I want
[1:17:55] to play is uh I'm sorry everybody is

[1:19:05] you make remain seated want to read some
[1:19:08] of God's
[1:19:11] word and I changed my my scriptures a
[1:19:15] while ago because go ahead and script uh
[1:19:19] move past the scriptures and pick up
[1:19:22] right past the scriptures thank you

[1:19:42] thou oh Lord and thy word are one so we
[1:19:46] pray tonight Lord that you will come
[1:19:48] Among Us in the power of your
[1:19:52] resurrection and will show forth to us
[1:19:56] tonight like those that came from
[1:20:00] emus that we too would return to our
[1:20:04] homes saying did not our hearts burn
[1:20:07] within us Grant it lord it's towards
[1:20:10] evening time again for we ask it in
[1:20:14] Jesus name
[1:20:18] amen now I want to speak concerning this
[1:20:23] Bible and my subject tonight for the
[1:20:28] topic is events made clear by
[1:20:33] prophecy events made clear by prophecy
[1:20:37] now the Bible is a different book from
[1:20:40] all other sacred books the Bible is a
[1:20:44] different book it is a book of Prophecy
[1:20:49] foretelling future
[1:20:51] events and it's also the revelation of
[1:20:56] Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis to
[1:20:59] Revelation brings him out in his
[1:21:02] fullness what he was and is and the
[1:21:06] whole complete book Revelations 1 1 to3
[1:21:11] said the book is a book of the
[1:21:14] revelation of Jesus Christ which is the
[1:21:17] word of God the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:21] Christ the word of God now all other
[1:21:25] books sacred books is only a code of
[1:21:28] ethics a code of morals or a code of
[1:21:34] theology something that how many ever
[1:21:37] read read the Quran the muhammadan Bible
[1:21:41] and um and the Book of on Buddhist and
[1:21:45] so forth it's just a code of ethics what
[1:21:49] people should live how they should live
[1:21:51] but it doesn't prophesy doesn't say
[1:21:54] anything about uh these things or about
[1:21:58] any special gifts being given to anybody
[1:22:01] anything to take place just like joining
[1:22:04] a lodge or something therefore when
[1:22:07] churches come to the place that they
[1:22:09] make their church just a lodge to join
[1:22:12] then they're plump off the word of God
[1:22:16] for the Bible is a living foretold
[1:22:20] witness of Jesus
[1:22:22] Christ and as the Earth has grown into
[1:22:26] its fullness and also Vines grow into
[1:22:29] their fullness the day grows into its
[1:22:31] fullness the Bible was manifested in its
[1:22:34] fullness in the person of Jesus Christ
[1:22:37] he was a word of God
[1:22:40] revealed the whole Complete Book of
[1:22:43] redemption the Bible is God's
[1:22:48] word forthtelling the future events its
[1:22:52] Believers is commanded by its author to
[1:22:55] read and believe every word of
[1:22:58] it not just part of it one word to
[1:23:03] disbelieve it you might as well quit
[1:23:06] trying until you believe that word every
[1:23:09] word is absolutely a part of almighty
[1:23:14] God God made manifest wound into his
[1:23:19] word to show
[1:23:21] forth who he is
[1:23:25] we are commanded as Believers to believe
[1:23:28] every word of it and it's wrote by the
[1:23:31] author of God himself there's nobody can
[1:23:35] add anything to it or take anything from
[1:23:37] it if you would it would be a freak body
[1:23:40] of
[1:23:42] God would have maybe like six fingers on
[1:23:44] one hand or or three arms or something
[1:23:48] to add something to take something away
[1:23:50] from it be one arm short one finger
[1:23:53] short it's a complete body of Jesus
[1:23:57] Christ and in Christ being the male the
[1:24:01] groom the bride is represented in him
[1:24:04] also and these two are one at that day
[1:24:08] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[1:24:11] father and me I and you and you and me
[1:24:14] what a complete
[1:24:16] picture and the True Believers in this
[1:24:19] word who accept it that
[1:24:22] way believe it and with patience wait
[1:24:26] for its prophesied promises every one of
[1:24:30] them to be manifested in its age every
[1:24:34] believer has watched for it every
[1:24:37] believer that's been on the toes
[1:24:38] watching is the one that's been revealed
[1:24:40] to now look in the days of the coming of
[1:24:43] the Lord Jesus why didn't those people
[1:24:46] recognize
[1:24:47] John when the Bible plainly said by
[1:24:51] Isaiah there will be a voice of one cist
[1:24:54] in the wilderness prepare the way of the
[1:24:57] Lord their last prophet they had which
[1:24:59] is Malachi 3 said behold I send my
[1:25:03] messenger before my face to prepare the
[1:25:06] way why didn't they see it because they
[1:25:09] was looking upon something that had been
[1:25:12] done basing their thoughts upon some
[1:25:15] message that had went forth beforehand
[1:25:18] and failed to see the present
[1:25:21] manifestation of God in the day they
[1:25:23] were living
[1:25:25] and Christians everywhere that's exactly
[1:25:28] where the world stands tonight without
[1:25:31] contradiction that's the truth
[1:25:34] Christians everywhere are trying to look
[1:25:36] back to some code of ethics that Mr
[1:25:39] Luther wrote or Mr Wesley sanki finny
[1:25:42] Knox Calvin which none of us can speak
[1:25:45] evil of but that was in a day
[1:25:50] passed the Pharisees look back to see
[1:25:53] what Moses said
[1:25:55] and they said we have Moses we don't
[1:25:57] know whence thou comest but remember
[1:26:00] when Moses here they didn't know whence
[1:26:02] he
[1:26:03] cometh and now they no wonder Jesus said
[1:26:08] to them you garnish the tombs of the
[1:26:11] prophets and you are the one that put
[1:26:14] them in there after their message is
[1:26:16] gone a message goes through the people
[1:26:20] see it they make fun of it the world
[1:26:22] does and then after the messenger is
[1:26:25] finished and the message is done then
[1:26:28] they build an
[1:26:30] denomination upon the message and there
[1:26:32] they die right there never come to life
[1:26:35] again look just a moment to some of you
[1:26:38] people and especially I speak to you
[1:26:40] Catholic
[1:26:41] people do you realize have you ever read
[1:26:45] the actual history the history of the
[1:26:49] Roman Catholic Church how it on your
[1:26:52] martyrology
[1:26:54] since St Augustine of Hippo how many
[1:26:58] million innocent people that the church
[1:27:00] put to
[1:27:02] death I forget can't call the exact
[1:27:05] number but it's up in the
[1:27:07] millions since St hippo of St a
[1:27:12] Augustine of hip of Hippo Africa made it
[1:27:17] a declaration that it was
[1:27:19] absolutely the will of God to put
[1:27:22] anybody to death that protest the Roman
[1:27:24] Catholic
[1:27:25] Church do you realize that in that that
[1:27:29] St Patrick was never recognized after
[1:27:32] his death as a Roman Catholic he
[1:27:35] protested the pope and all of his
[1:27:37] doings and the Catholic Church itself
[1:27:40] killed tens of thousands of his
[1:27:44] children did you know that the Catholic
[1:27:47] Church burnt Jonah AR that little
[1:27:49] sainted woman to the state for being
[1:27:52] said she was a witch
[1:27:57] 200 years later dug up the bodies of the
[1:27:59] priest when they found out it was wrong
[1:28:01] and cast them into the sea without
[1:28:03] bearing them in the sacred ground to do
[1:28:05] Penance don't let the day pass over your
[1:28:08] head and be
[1:28:10] foolish how that priests would like
[1:28:13] tonight to come forth that condemn Jesus
[1:28:15] the only thing they never seen the
[1:28:17] prediction of that
[1:28:19] hour if they Jesus said search the
[1:28:22] scriptures for in them you think or
[1:28:25] other claim that you have eternal life
[1:28:27] and the scriptures is what tell you who
[1:28:30] I
[1:28:31] am for that
[1:28:33] hour notice the Bible cannot fail it's
[1:28:38] one thing it cannot do the word of God
[1:28:40] fail for it foretells its author's acts
[1:28:46] before he does
[1:28:47] it now there's one chance out of a
[1:28:51] thousand that a man might make a
[1:28:53] prediction
[1:28:55] uh and something other's going to happen
[1:28:57] and it would
[1:28:58] happen but then if he places the where
[1:29:01] it's going to happen that cuts him down
[1:29:03] to maybe um One Chance out of
[1:29:07] 10,000 if he says the day it's going to
[1:29:09] happen that cuts it down one chance out
[1:29:11] of about a
[1:29:12] million and who it's going to happen to
[1:29:15] that brings it down to billions of
[1:29:18] chances but this
[1:29:21] Bible tells you exactly
[1:29:24] who when where and what to look for and
[1:29:27] never has failed one
[1:29:29] time therefore in a little discussion
[1:29:33] not long ago with a priest of the Sacred
[1:29:35] Heart Church up here said Mr brandham
[1:29:38] you're trying to argue a
[1:29:41] Bible but that's the history of the
[1:29:44] church I said it's not a history it's
[1:29:47] God himself in
[1:29:48] Prince he said God is in his church I
[1:29:52] said God is in the word in anything
[1:29:55] contrary to it let it be a lie or he
[1:29:58] said let my word be true and every man's
[1:30:00] word a lie he said we're not to argue I
[1:30:03] said I never ask you to argue but the
[1:30:06] Bible does say come let us reason
[1:30:10] together it foretells the author's
[1:30:13] doings before he does it therefore
[1:30:16] telling that then that puts every man
[1:30:20] and woman at the Judgment bar without
[1:30:23] any excuse
[1:30:25] if you take what the methodists say
[1:30:27] about it what the Baptist say about it
[1:30:30] what the Catholic says what the
[1:30:31] Pentecostal says or any other
[1:30:35] Church you might find some
[1:30:37] disappointments at the Judgment but if
[1:30:40] you'll just watch what the Bible says is
[1:30:42] going to happen and when it happens then
[1:30:45] you'll recognize what happens now it
[1:30:48] isn't right out in plain view that all
[1:30:51] people can see it for Jesus thank God
[1:30:54] for hiding it from the eyes of the wise
[1:30:57] and prudent and would reveal it to babes
[1:30:59] such as would learn think of almighty
[1:31:02] God setting in his own word with power
[1:31:06] to Blind the rich and imputed and and
[1:31:10] educated Scholars blind their eyes so
[1:31:13] they can't see him and Open the Eyes of
[1:31:17] the poor and
[1:31:21] literate notice these people from from
[1:31:24] him he said their their understanding of
[1:31:28] him was with help they talked to him and
[1:31:30] didn't even know who it was all day
[1:31:33] long God can do that or he's God that's
[1:31:38] exactly what he done to those priests
[1:31:40] those
[1:31:41] scribes because it was written that he
[1:31:44] had to do
[1:31:45] that God blinded their eyes so we'd have
[1:31:48] a
[1:31:50] chance notice they couldn't see no
[1:31:52] matter how much scy
[1:31:54] how much priest they was what they had
[1:31:56] done they still could not see it because
[1:31:59] they were blind their sight might been
[1:32:02] 2020 physically but their spiritual
[1:32:04] sight the same thing I was trying to say
[1:32:07] this morning about the adultery of women
[1:32:09] dressing the way they do now they are
[1:32:12] adulterers and God's book there are
[1:32:14] guilty of adultery every time they put
[1:32:16] on sexy looking
[1:32:19] clothes their soul not knowing it I
[1:32:23] believe them women many of them
[1:32:24] thousands of them are innocent and would
[1:32:27] by no means commit adultery and the poor
[1:32:31] women with somebody who will let him get
[1:32:34] by with it without exposing it and tell
[1:32:37] the
[1:32:38] truth commit adultery which the Bible
[1:32:42] said the that set up on many
[1:32:44] Waters that all the kings of the earth
[1:32:47] and the peoples of the Earth the
[1:32:49] churches and so forth committed
[1:32:52] spiritual fornications with him
[1:32:54] her and she was a mother of
[1:32:57] harlot's
[1:33:00] denominations we watch the Bible for God
[1:33:04] doesn't leave us in
[1:33:05] darkness he sent the Bible to foretell
[1:33:08] us the events before they happen in the
[1:33:11] very nature and time they would
[1:33:14] come now it's something like uh uh
[1:33:18] looking on a calendar to see what date
[1:33:20] it is if you think say this is this
[1:33:24] Saturday Sunday what is it look on the
[1:33:26] calendar the calendar will tell you what
[1:33:30] day it is when you see the actions of
[1:33:32] the people maybe going to church you see
[1:33:34] the the hear the bells ringing you
[1:33:36] wonder what day it is look on the
[1:33:38] calendar it'll tell you what day it is
[1:33:40] and when you see the church getting
[1:33:42] whirly like it was the days of Sodom see
[1:33:45] the church world all going into the
[1:33:47] worship the God of this evil age and
[1:33:49] seeing that then seeing a little
[1:33:52] minority group gathered out
[1:33:54] under the inspiration of God producing
[1:33:57] again the life of Jesus Christ by the
[1:33:59] scriptures that's supposed to happen you
[1:34:01] know what hour you're living
[1:34:05] in this Bible foretells by prophecy what
[1:34:09] day that we're living and what time
[1:34:11] we're living and what kind of events
[1:34:14] ought to be taking place it foretells it
[1:34:17] exactly to the letter and has never
[1:34:20] missed one
[1:34:22] age all the time time not one time has
[1:34:25] it ever missed and it won't for who are
[1:34:29] predestinated to see it will see it
[1:34:32] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:34:34] my father draws him and all that the
[1:34:36] father has given me will come it's a
[1:34:39] word jaring with the word it can't do
[1:34:42] nothing
[1:34:44] else we know the day that we're living
[1:34:47] in but as it has been in every age
[1:34:51] people let man put their own interpret
[1:34:53] ation to this word and causes them to be
[1:34:57] blinded to the event that's happened
[1:34:59] same thing it done with the Pharisees
[1:35:01] and Sadducees even when Paul stood there
[1:35:04] and tried to quote the
[1:35:06] scripture and one man smoted him in the
[1:35:09] face because he called the high priest
[1:35:11] of whiteed
[1:35:13] wall and then they miss seeing God
[1:35:16] confirm his prophesied word see the
[1:35:20] Bible doesn't contradict itself the
[1:35:22] Bible is God
[1:35:24] there's no contradiction in God he's
[1:35:27] perfect but the people with their own
[1:35:31] interpretation now notice let me show
[1:35:33] you
[1:35:35] friends the churches cannot agree them
[1:35:38] themselves on the interpretation of
[1:35:41] it the Methodist can't agree with the
[1:35:44] Baptist the Baptist the Presbyterian the
[1:35:46] Presbyterian the Pentecostals and with
[1:35:49] about 40 different organizations of
[1:35:50] Pentecost they can't agree with one of
[1:35:54] another so you see that would be
[1:35:56] babbling again
[1:35:59] confusing but God does his own
[1:36:02] interpretating of his word he promises
[1:36:05] thing and then does it
[1:36:08] himself he gives himself the
[1:36:10] interpretation of it because He makes
[1:36:12] himself known in that hour how far the
[1:36:16] the body of Christ is advance from the
[1:36:18] feet to the Head notice then that's the
[1:36:22] reason that these people fail to get it
[1:36:24] because they listen to what somebody
[1:36:26] else says about it instead of reading
[1:36:28] the word like Jesus told them to do and
[1:36:31] they are they that
[1:36:33] testify of me search the scriptures in
[1:36:37] them you think you have eternal life and
[1:36:39] they are they that testify of me in
[1:36:43] other words listen what read the
[1:36:46] scriptures and see what the Messiah was
[1:36:49] supposed to do see what time the Messiah
[1:36:52] was supposed to come look who was going
[1:36:54] to forun the Messiah look at the hour
[1:36:57] there's to be a voice of one crying in
[1:36:59] the wilderness
[1:37:00] John and you're done Tony exactly what
[1:37:03] you listed look what I was supposed to
[1:37:05] do when I come and now what have you
[1:37:08] done have I failed to meet this see
[1:37:12] Jesus speaking have I failed to meet
[1:37:15] this Lord say we come on down through
[1:37:17] the scriptures this afternoon how that
[1:37:19] everything that was prophesied of him
[1:37:22] happened just exactly way it supposed
[1:37:24] they should have know this event this
[1:37:28] fanatic young fellow raised up about 33
[1:37:31] years old and or 30 years old and went
[1:37:34] down there and claimed all kinds of
[1:37:35] lights and doves ascending and why was
[1:37:38] this a a
[1:37:40] disgrace they said he was born with
[1:37:42] illegitimate parents claimed he was born
[1:37:44] of a virgin birth ought they not to know
[1:37:47] that Isaiah said in Isaiah 9:6 unto us a
[1:37:52] child is born ought not they to know
[1:37:55] also that the prophet Isaiah said a
[1:37:58] virgin shall
[1:38:01] conceive they ought to have know these
[1:38:03] things but you see the thing of it was
[1:38:06] they were applying it somewhere way
[1:38:08] ahead and this man to them didn't meet
[1:38:11] the
[1:38:12] specification but he asked them search
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:16] scriptures for you thinking then that
[1:38:19] you have eternal life and they are the
[1:38:21] very thing that's testifying to my
[1:38:25] message not what some theologians said
[1:38:27] but what God his own word said would
[1:38:29] take
[1:38:30] place
[1:38:32] amen so is it
[1:38:35] now search the
[1:38:38] scriptures where they are the one that
[1:38:40] tells us the hour we're living in tells
[1:38:43] us exactly what will take place in this
[1:38:45] day they are the ones that you should
[1:38:48] rely upon for they are the one that
[1:38:51] testifies of the person
[1:38:54] of Jesus
[1:38:55] Christ for the Bible said that he's the
[1:38:58] same yesterday today and forever because
[1:39:00] he's a revelation of the word in the
[1:39:03] age can't be no
[1:39:05] different therefore by listening to
[1:39:07] man's interpretation they see the
[1:39:10] confirmation of God's word fulfilled
[1:39:14] they fail to see it because it's going
[1:39:17] on all the time but because they listen
[1:39:20] and Jesus said they're blind leaders and
[1:39:23] if the blind leads a blind what happens
[1:39:26] to him I remember the Bible predicted
[1:39:30] this ecclesiastical age of this lady
[1:39:33] ofan age was
[1:39:37] blind they had him outside the church
[1:39:40] there's not another
[1:39:42] age another church age that Jesus is on
[1:39:46] the outside but the lady Sea church age
[1:39:48] he was on the outside trying to get back
[1:39:52] in a stand at the door and knock you're
[1:39:55] supposed to be
[1:39:56] inside but he said because you say I'm
[1:40:00] rich increased in Goods have need of
[1:40:03] nothing and don't
[1:40:05] know don't know that you're
[1:40:10] blind leading the
[1:40:12] blind poor in spirit
[1:40:17] wred miserable naked and don't know it
[1:40:22] what a if a man was naked on the street
[1:40:25] miserable blind and you had sense enough
[1:40:27] that you could tell him he was naked to
[1:40:28] try to do something about it but when he
[1:40:30] shakes his head I want to have
[1:40:33] it who are you to tell me what to do I
[1:40:35] know where I'm standing now if that in't
[1:40:37] a pitiful shape I don't know and that's
[1:40:40] exactly what the God of this Bible said
[1:40:44] that the church would be in in this evil
[1:40:47] age right now in the last Church age
[1:40:49] where we're
[1:40:51] living notice but to the peoples as many
[1:40:55] as I love I
[1:40:58] rebuke now if you're rebuked to the Lord
[1:41:01] of what you're doing come out of it then
[1:41:04] get away from it as many as I love I
[1:41:09] rebuke now seeing God now what if those
[1:41:13] Pharisees would said wait a
[1:41:15] minute that man's give us quite a
[1:41:17] challenge he said search the scriptures
[1:41:20] or in them you think you have eternal
[1:41:22] life they testify me it's better that I
[1:41:24] look back in the scriptures and find out
[1:41:25] what he's supposed to do who he is
[1:41:28] what's supposed to take place I should
[1:41:31] look back and find out instead of that
[1:41:33] they went to the priest and asked him
[1:41:34] what about it see the
[1:41:37] difference they should have been reading
[1:41:40] the
[1:41:41] word in Hebrews 1:1 the Bible said God
[1:41:46] in sunra
[1:41:47] times that's old times and in diverse
[1:41:52] manners wrote the Bible by the prophets
[1:41:55] now notice he wrote the Bible by his own
[1:42:00] chosen
[1:42:02] way see now he didn't have to write that
[1:42:07] way neither did he have to save Man by
[1:42:11] Blood he didn't have to preach the
[1:42:13] gospel by man he could let the sun of
[1:42:15] the moon or the Stars preach the gospel
[1:42:17] he could let the winds hum the gospel
[1:42:20] but he chose man
[1:42:23] and he chose the way his word came and
[1:42:26] that was by His prophets which were
[1:42:29] predestinated and for ordained being a
[1:42:32] part of God's word declaring the
[1:42:37] revelation of his word to that age and
[1:42:39] that time for the word of God came to
[1:42:43] the prophets
[1:42:44] only never does it come to a
[1:42:47] theologian show me the Scripture it
[1:42:50] comes only to prophets God cannot line
[1:42:54] so God wrote the Bible by his chosen
[1:42:57] method and his own chosen prophets not
[1:43:02] the prophets man had chose but the
[1:43:04] prophets God had
[1:43:06] chose then it's Believers watch far the
[1:43:09] Fulfillment of what their prophets said
[1:43:12] and that's identification that they are
[1:43:15] God's prophets because first they're
[1:43:19] inspired next they say exactly with the
[1:43:22] word word of the
[1:43:24] hour then that's is
[1:43:26] credentials see we went through that
[1:43:29] last Sunday many false prophets will
[1:43:31] rise and we give the illustrations how
[1:43:34] that balam and Moses both of them
[1:43:36] Anointed with the same
[1:43:38] Spirit one of them said we're all one
[1:43:40] let's come Jo put our girls and all
[1:43:42] together we got pretty girls over here
[1:43:44] you boys come over here and take your ni
[1:43:46] wife it's all right we're all one people
[1:43:47] in out the same race God never did
[1:43:50] forgive them for they listen to that see
[1:43:53] the world and the the people are
[1:43:56] watching for some little
[1:43:59] Outlet some little bass some little
[1:44:02] shortcut but there is no shortcuts in
[1:44:05] the word of God there's one pattern you
[1:44:09] must cut yourself and fit that pattern
[1:44:11] not try to cut the pattern to fit you
[1:44:14] everybody must do that that's the only
[1:44:17] way God has the doing it
[1:44:20] notice now the Believers wait for that
[1:44:23] word to be confirmed see it was not
[1:44:26] wrote by man but by the Lord God
[1:44:30] therefore it's not a book of man
[1:44:33] somebody says this some old Hebrew
[1:44:35] writings would the Hebrews write a
[1:44:37] letter that condemn themselves with that
[1:44:40] fine nation of Jews self sty and
[1:44:43] Polished would they write their own
[1:44:45] iniquities condemning them own selves
[1:44:48] certainly not tell of his own sins how
[1:44:51] they went into idolatry how they
[1:44:53] committed fornications against God's
[1:44:55] word no no they never tell that that
[1:44:58] proud Nation it's not a book of man it's
[1:45:01] a book of
[1:45:02] God and the man who sees the Visions or
[1:45:05] hears the voice of
[1:45:07] God never understood it many times
[1:45:11] themselves in many cases see man didn't
[1:45:14] write the Bible God wrote the
[1:45:17] Bible it is
[1:45:20] not it's not a man's book it's God's
[1:45:22] book it is God's thoughts expressed
[1:45:25] through human
[1:45:26] lips that's what makes it the Bible a
[1:45:29] thought expressed is a word and in the
[1:45:32] beginning was God's thinking he
[1:45:34] expressed it through the lips of His
[1:45:35] prophets and confirmed
[1:45:37] it by his
[1:45:39] servants notice God does his own
[1:45:42] choosing by predestination chose the
[1:45:45] prophets forever age Noti he fixes the
[1:45:47] nature of that Prophet to fit that
[1:45:50] age see he fits style whatever he does
[1:45:55] he fits him whether he's educated or Not
[1:45:57] educated he fits the gifts the manner
[1:46:00] that he'll preach in the gifts he'll
[1:46:03] have and the message for that certain
[1:46:06] age God's predestinated that certain
[1:46:09] thing to happen and there's not another
[1:46:10] thing can take its place care what it is
[1:46:13] how many man-made achievements nothing
[1:46:15] can take its place he predestinated the
[1:46:18] man may be an ignorant man he might have
[1:46:19] predestinated another kind of a man
[1:46:21] whatever he is he gives him his class
[1:46:24] his his gift give him his nature his
[1:46:27] style and whatever it is how he
[1:46:28] expresses himself and whatever he does
[1:46:30] he makes the man of the hour to catch
[1:46:33] the people of the
[1:46:36] hour he does it at the end of each age
[1:46:39] when the church has turned to the world
[1:46:42] in sin and leaning upon man's
[1:46:46] interpretation of the word as ever they
[1:46:49] always at the End of the Age have gotten
[1:46:52] such a Mess by their theologians and
[1:46:55] Priests until it's always a mess up
[1:46:58] always their interpretation is wrong not
[1:47:01] one time has it ever failed to be wrong
[1:47:05] and not one time has God's word ever
[1:47:07] failed to be right that's the difference
[1:47:11] now see God wrote the Bible
[1:47:14] himself now God can
[1:47:18] speak Moses said he spoke to him
[1:47:21] Jeremiah said he put words in my
[1:47:24] out and God can write he wrote the Ten
[1:47:28] Commandments with his own finger he
[1:47:30] wrote on the walls of
[1:47:33] Babylon and remembered of the Old
[1:47:36] Testament loone 2,000 times the prophet
[1:47:39] said thus sayith the
[1:47:42] Lord God can speak God can
[1:47:46] write
[1:47:48] certainly almost 90% of Matthew Mark
[1:47:52] Luke and John is the very words of God
[1:47:55] himself Jesus Christ
[1:47:57] speaking so if God can write if God can
[1:48:01] read if God can talk can he cause others
[1:48:06] to do the same did not he say to Moses
[1:48:09] who makes man dumb or who gives him
[1:48:12] speech God wrote the Bible by the
[1:48:15] prophets his way of doing
[1:48:19] it now every time that the church gets
[1:48:22] mixed up and God forew they would for he
[1:48:24] forew all things therefore he has a
[1:48:28] certain Prophet ready for that age to
[1:48:30] call his electon by his edicated word of
[1:48:34] signs and wonders and confirmation of
[1:48:37] his word confirming the word with signs
[1:48:40] following as he promised he gives the
[1:48:43] true interpretation after the prophet
[1:48:45] himself has been Vindicated
[1:48:57] we could go through that line by
[1:49:00] line I mean I I I there's so much in
[1:49:06] there but I'm not going to uh take very
[1:49:10] much more of your time uh just uh it's
[1:49:15] marvelous amen but you notice the
[1:49:18] admonition that he tells us he says
[1:49:21] don't miss it
[1:49:24] don't
[1:49:25] don't don't fall into the
[1:49:29] Trap of looking back you understand
[1:49:33] there's things that are transpiring
[1:49:35] right now that are prophesied events of
[1:49:41] God that you can
[1:49:43] see thank you Lord and but you're
[1:49:46] counsell right to buy eyesa that you
[1:49:49] might see you're counseled to say Lord
[1:49:53] open my eyes let me see let me read the
[1:49:56] scriptures how many times did he refer
[1:49:59] read the scriptures go look at the
[1:50:01] scriptures look what the scripture said
[1:50:04] you know before the great and Dreadful
[1:50:06] day I'll send you Elijah the prophet as
[1:50:10] it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:50:13] so shall it be in the uh coming and the
[1:50:16] revealing of the son of man look at the
[1:50:20] events he vindicates it and then shows
[1:50:23] you the events that are are supposed to
[1:50:27] take place and and so now we come down
[1:50:32] to if I could say this this morning just
[1:50:35] the few minutes that I want to
[1:50:38] spend where am I in this picture in
[1:50:44] other words what was propes Side of
[1:50:50] Me Okay I I I I see that I see the age I
[1:50:55] see the hour I see Sodom and gomorah I
[1:50:58] see the world falling apart you do you
[1:51:01] know how many know that everybody that's
[1:51:05] around we're in a great election season
[1:51:08] and it's
[1:51:10] 5050 that's what they say I don't know
[1:51:14] you know I only know one that knows and
[1:51:17] whoever he wants in is going to be in
[1:51:20] that's and it's not for our better it's
[1:51:23] for our
[1:51:27] destruction so I don't care if you think
[1:51:30] Donald Trump will destroy the world
[1:51:32] cricker vote for him if you think KLA
[1:51:35] Harris will destroy the world cricker
[1:51:36] vote for
[1:51:39] her I don't care but the event
[1:51:43] is no Kingdom divided against itself can
[1:51:48] stand that's what you got to be able to
[1:51:51] look at you're not picking sides here
[1:51:55] what's going on why are we going in two
[1:51:59] directions why are we so divided what
[1:52:02] happened how did this get on this
[1:52:04] country how did America get in this
[1:52:06] shape we know how she got in this shape
[1:52:09] she rejected
[1:52:13] God we were told they were going to
[1:52:15] reject God we were told they were
[1:52:18] actually written in the messages that we
[1:52:20] look to that there would come come a
[1:52:22] time they wouldn't know the difference
[1:52:24] between a man and a
[1:52:27] woman and now they can't even answer
[1:52:30] that
[1:52:35] question I mean it's don't the events
[1:52:40] because it's the living foretold word of
[1:52:44] God he he the prophet of God said he
[1:52:48] acts on it before he speaks it
[1:52:53] it's all it's it's all these things are
[1:52:56] coming to pass all these events that we
[1:52:59] see around this have already been made
[1:53:03] clear by prophecy in other words they
[1:53:07] have there's a reason behind every
[1:53:11] single bit of it amen that's right think
[1:53:16] of
[1:53:17] it so you you you might just be living
[1:53:20] in the second but
[1:53:23] he he he made the statement he says that
[1:53:26] that it keeps moving
[1:53:28] on it keeps growing now so I could go
[1:53:32] through a whole list if I could say that
[1:53:35] of all the all
[1:53:38] the
[1:53:40] uh negative things that are going on
[1:53:44] with the Sodom gamorra condition with
[1:53:47] the hatred that people have and and how
[1:53:51] how that
[1:53:53] uh there's a hatred for the word of God
[1:53:56] in our country now there's a hatred for
[1:53:58] churches there's a hatred uh uh uh
[1:54:02] there's a whole people that they don't
[1:54:05] believe in God they don't believe that
[1:54:07] our government should have anything to
[1:54:10] do with supporting churches helping
[1:54:13] churches giving churches any benefits or
[1:54:17] anything they they think that's uh
[1:54:20] ludicrous uh that that groups and
[1:54:23] buildings like this should should be not
[1:54:27] have to pay
[1:54:29] taxes and that's the way they
[1:54:32] feel they feel that's not right well the
[1:54:35] reason our government did that because
[1:54:37] churches kept crime off the street they
[1:54:40] taught morals to kids they they were
[1:54:43] beneficial to society right now you've
[1:54:47] got people that don't think churches are
[1:54:49] beneficial to society why because they
[1:54:53] speak out against sex changes uh in your
[1:54:56] kids without you knowing
[1:55:01] it they're they're the even though
[1:55:04] they're
[1:55:06] political but yet they're they're trying
[1:55:09] to hang on to some sort of voice right
[1:55:13] some sort of that thing trying to hold
[1:55:16] who try to stand up and say yeah there's
[1:55:19] a difference between men and women look
[1:55:21] at the things are fighting
[1:55:23] over should a boy be on a girl's
[1:55:30] team now that ought to strike
[1:55:34] you
[1:55:36] spiritually because the Bible says
[1:55:39] because they wish not to retain God in
[1:55:43] their knowledge God gave them over to a
[1:55:48] reprobate mind
[1:55:52] you sit back and say how can they think
[1:55:54] this way what's wrong with those
[1:55:57] people I can't even imagine they're
[1:56:00] doing this wait a minute that event is
[1:56:03] made clear by
[1:56:09] prophecy those actions are made
[1:56:12] clear by prophecy that thinking that
[1:56:17] philosophy that those actions it's made
[1:56:20] clear
[1:56:22] by prophecy yes sir we should see the
[1:56:27] events we should we should we we should
[1:56:30] see what's happening around
[1:56:32] us and then because it's the Living Word
[1:56:38] of God be because it's uh it's it's the
[1:56:45] Bible is a living foretold witness a
[1:56:48] living
[1:56:50] witness then I have to look at myself
[1:56:53] and say what what am I
[1:56:58] manifesting what is my portion and my
[1:57:03] part in this living
[1:57:06] prophecy now we want we're not talking
[1:57:09] about a natural
[1:57:12] sight the political scene the the other
[1:57:16] scene we're we're talking about
[1:57:18] spiritual
[1:57:20] eyesight and so again I want to just
[1:57:23] take one second
[1:57:25] here and then we have a baptism
[1:57:28] uh EJ is going to get baptized so we'll
[1:57:32] have a a baptism I've called him EJ so
[1:57:36] long I I think I forgot his real
[1:57:39] name right
[1:57:43] but there's another wonderful
[1:57:46] thing taking
[1:57:49] place and I want to to spend about five
[1:57:52] maybe 10 minutes on this I see the world
[1:57:57] falling apart does anybody see it
[1:57:58] falling
[1:58:00] apart I mean people talk about saving
[1:58:03] America America's
[1:58:07] gone our messenger told us it would be
[1:58:10] gone we told us it would be in a Sodom
[1:58:13] condition
[1:58:15] right total as it was in the days of
[1:58:18] Noah giving into marriage and marri
[1:58:22] marriage and divorce and not even being
[1:58:24] married all those things are evident to
[1:58:28] those that have spiritual Isa all these
[1:58:32] events are made clear by prophecy but
[1:58:36] what's
[1:58:37] prophesied about
[1:58:42] me okay if I'm a part of it it's living
[1:58:48] that and and the events are made clear
[1:58:52] by the word of God then I want to say
[1:58:55] this way I want to be made
[1:59:00] clear you understand make me clear Lord
[1:59:04] Place me position me give me Revelation
[1:59:08] to see what am I in this
[1:59:12] hour you can be
[1:59:16] lukewarm but he said I would that you be
[1:59:19] either hot or cold but if you're
[1:59:21] lukewarm
[1:59:22] I want to spill thee out of my mouth so
[1:59:25] I want to sit back wait a minute am I
[1:59:30] lukew it are my
[1:59:34] actions and my thinking speaking of an
[1:59:39] event that was prophesied to be here is
[1:59:43] my attitude towards the word my life my
[1:59:47] My Lifestyle the things that I I I I in
[1:59:52] cumber myself
[1:59:53] with are these
[1:59:56] evidences of a prophesied
[2:00:00] word they worship me with their lips but
[2:00:03] their their hearts are far from
[2:00:09] me where do where where do I
[2:00:13] stand
[2:00:15] good what what what is spoken of me what
[2:00:19] events
[2:00:22] in my life are being made
[2:00:26] clear by
[2:00:29] prophecy now you can't get away from it
[2:00:32] that's
[2:00:34] right you understand it's
[2:00:39] spoken well God said let he said he when
[2:00:44] he said let there be light there was
[2:00:46] light and God's
[2:00:50] word calls for in other words God's word
[2:00:56] prophesies of a total separation from
[2:01:01] unbelief
[2:01:04] Hallelujah God prophesies that there
[2:01:06] will be a people that believes every
[2:01:10] word of
[2:01:14] God now we just listen to this little
[2:01:17] spot and I just will read this he says
[2:01:21] when you see SE the church getting
[2:01:24] worldly now that's an
[2:01:27] event that's made clear by
[2:01:31] prophecy churches getting
[2:01:36] worldly I went to a meeting with pastors
[2:01:40] uh with the police chief and and and
[2:01:43] different things so we went there and
[2:01:45] met the police chief and and there were
[2:01:48] some uh women pastors there
[2:01:52] and uh uh and you know the things that
[2:01:56] they were concerned about and the things
[2:01:58] that they were talking about you know
[2:02:00] that that's great great social living
[2:02:03] you know uh uh they reach out to to the
[2:02:09] uh I don't know what communities they
[2:02:11] call them LBP XYZ everybody's got an
[2:02:16] initial you you know what I mean I'd
[2:02:18] rather we had the Holy
[2:02:20] Ghost but but this is what he says when
[2:02:23] you see the church getting worldly like
[2:02:26] it was in the days of
[2:02:28] Sodom
[2:02:30] to you see the
[2:02:33] church world all going into the into the
[2:02:39] worship the God of this evil age and see
[2:02:44] that he says then seen now look at
[2:02:48] there's another
[2:02:50] event the one event is the world
[2:02:53] becoming like Sodom the world going into
[2:02:56] all these things that they're going into
[2:02:59] the but there's another event that's
[2:03:04] prophesied there's something else that's
[2:03:08] that is going to be made
[2:03:12] clear you understand because he can't
[2:03:15] leave these prophecies unclear
[2:03:21] he's he's got he's got to clarify
[2:03:24] it not only does he have to clarify it
[2:03:28] he has to identify it for what that it
[2:03:31] is so it's
[2:03:36] unmistakable he
[2:03:39] predestines and we heard that of people
[2:03:41] to be there he
[2:03:44] said he says and seeing that and seeing
[2:03:49] that right and seen that this is
[2:03:54] Sodom this is where we are how many sees
[2:03:57] that
[2:03:59] amen how many SE there's a complete
[2:04:02] change in the last five or six 10 years
[2:04:06] in this
[2:04:09] country that is absolutely moving so
[2:04:14] fast but it's been
[2:04:18] prophesied you say how has it been
[2:04:21] prophesied if the days wouldn't be
[2:04:24] shortened no flesh would be
[2:04:27] saved these these things aren't
[2:04:30] gradually working in now they're moving
[2:04:33] faster than you canbat and
[2:04:36] I you know all of a sudden Wham just
[2:04:41] like
[2:04:42] that the some people got into some power
[2:04:46] and decided that they're going to change
[2:04:50] how people were made
[2:04:52] God made them male and female that's
[2:04:55] right now they're going to change that
[2:04:57] sir you you see how insane that is yes
[2:05:02] sir that men think that they can do some
[2:05:06] sort of surgery and change something the
[2:05:09] way God made
[2:05:11] it they don't make it or change it they
[2:05:15] just pervert
[2:05:19] it but when we see that that's Sodom but
[2:05:23] when we see the church we're all going
[2:05:25] into the worship of the God of this evil
[2:05:28] age so they've all gone into worshiping
[2:05:32] the God of this evil age knowledge
[2:05:35] science education politics they're all
[2:05:39] worshiping it Y when you see
[2:05:43] that if you see that event made
[2:05:48] clear then there ought to be another
[2:05:50] event
[2:05:52] that we see that's being made
[2:05:58] clear because we're called out we're
[2:06:02] told to be
[2:06:03] separate now this is
[2:06:06] beautiful he
[2:06:09] says then
[2:06:13] seeing now I'm asking you are you seeing
[2:06:17] this is this clear to
[2:06:20] you have you recognize this taking place
[2:06:24] yes sir in your
[2:06:28] life cuz we we want you to see this we
[2:06:31] want to understand this and seeing that
[2:06:34] then seeing a
[2:06:36] little minority
[2:06:39] group Gathering out under the
[2:06:42] inspiration of
[2:06:45] God producing
[2:06:48] again the life of Jesus Christ
[2:06:52] Christ by the scriptures that's supposed
[2:06:56] to
[2:06:57] happen you know what hour you're living
[2:07:05] in praise
[2:07:07] God there's a Min minority group of
[2:07:14] people that have heard the word of God
[2:07:17] that are LED
[2:07:20] out under the the inspiration of
[2:07:24] God could I say what's the inspiration
[2:07:27] of God it's by the
[2:07:30] revelation of God's word there's a
[2:07:33] people that is being led
[2:07:37] out do you feel yourself being led out
[2:07:40] of this this uh Sodom do you feel
[2:07:44] yourself being led out of the world
[2:07:46] you're being inspired away from it to
[2:07:49] manifest Jesus Christ Christ Hallelujah
[2:07:52] that's an
[2:07:55] event that's an event that's living
[2:07:59] where is the
[2:08:01] event the foretold living prophecy we
[2:08:07] see the foretold living prophecy in all
[2:08:10] the events that are taking and gathering
[2:08:12] around us where do I
[2:08:15] see this
[2:08:17] foretold living prophecy of a minority
[2:08:21] group Gathering out under the
[2:08:23] inspiration of God producing again the
[2:08:27] life of Jesus
[2:08:31] Christ where do you see
[2:08:34] it you better see it right
[2:08:41] here you better say this is an
[2:08:45] event that I have to join myself to
[2:08:51] this is an event that I have to be aware
[2:08:54] of that there's an
[2:08:56] inspiration that's separating me from
[2:09:00] all these things that are taking place
[2:09:02] and this
[2:09:04] prophecy is being made
[2:09:08] clear in
[2:09:12] me oh now
[2:09:15] you're wound
[2:09:19] in the word of God
[2:09:24] you're wound into the word of God so all
[2:09:27] these other events We Major so much time
[2:09:30] on all the corruption and all the
[2:09:32] falling
[2:09:33] away but we don't think in the midst of
[2:09:35] all that corruption and falling away
[2:09:37] there's a people that are making clear
[2:09:42] the living Jesus Christ than you Lord Oh
[2:09:46] I like that don't you
[2:09:53] he says and you know what hour you're
[2:09:55] living the Bible for tells by prophecy
[2:09:59] what day that we're living and what time
[2:10:02] we're living and what kind of events
[2:10:05] ought to be taking place it foretells it
[2:10:08] exactly to the letter and has never
[2:10:13] missed one age all the time not one time
[2:10:18] has it ever missed and it won't
[2:10:21] won't for who
[2:10:25] for it won't for who are predestinated
[2:10:29] to see it will see it Lord Jesus said no
[2:10:34] man can come to me except my father
[2:10:37] draws him and all that the father hath
[2:10:40] given
[2:10:42] me will come it's the word joining with
[2:10:48] the word it can't do nothing else we
[2:10:51] know that day that we're living
[2:10:56] in and so we we we want to see this
[2:11:00] event made
[2:11:03] clear so what I want you to understand
[2:11:06] is you're not in a struggle you're
[2:11:09] actually part of a prophesied event
[2:11:16] Hallelujah why did I come out of my
[2:11:19] denomination why did I come out of my
[2:11:21] Church how did I get here how did I come
[2:11:23] across this message why why was I
[2:11:27] brought under conviction why it wasn't
[2:11:29] an
[2:11:32] accident it was
[2:11:35] foretold the Bible is a foretold
[2:11:41] event it was foretold that you'd be
[2:11:44] listening to the radio and somebody
[2:11:47] would mention the name of William
[2:11:49] Brandon it would strike you you would
[2:11:51] would run over you'd start listening to
[2:11:53] his books and listening to his tapes and
[2:11:55] read the book and all a sudden go
[2:11:58] whoa that was prophesied of
[2:12:03] you you're that
[2:12:07] event unfolding and manifesting the
[2:12:11] bride in this last day is prophesied and
[2:12:14] if it's prophesied has got to be made
[2:12:19] clear how could he make the other events
[2:12:22] clear without making the prophecy
[2:12:29] clear Every Nation every tongue every
[2:12:36] Kindred we may not be a lot of things
[2:12:39] that other churches are but that's one
[2:12:41] thing we
[2:12:42] got we got every tongue every nation and
[2:12:46] every Kindred type there is
[2:12:53] why
[2:12:55] why they come from the East and West
[2:12:59] they come from the lands afar
[2:13:02] why cuz it's an
[2:13:06] event a prophecy that's got to be made
[2:13:12] clear they'll love one another they'll
[2:13:15] know you are my disciples by your love
[2:13:17] for another it's it's an event but see
[2:13:20] if we don't have have spiritual
[2:13:22] eyes we're actually always looking
[2:13:25] outside of what's really happening right
[2:13:28] in
[2:13:31] here the
[2:13:34] transformation of
[2:13:37] you to little Messiahs and little
[2:13:44] Messiahs does God have to fulfill that
[2:13:48] it's been prophesied
[2:13:51] he's got to make it clear praise God I'm
[2:13:54] not going to put myself on the other
[2:13:57] side it's prophesied they'll be
[2:14:00] Overcomers there's things I have to
[2:14:05] overcome but is given to the
[2:14:08] Overcomer to sit with him on his
[2:14:12] throne what's the church going to be
[2:14:14] made out of people from the highways and
[2:14:17] the byways and people with problems and
[2:14:21] weaknesses in all things because his
[2:14:24] strength is made perfect in
[2:14:28] weakness oh it I I just hope your heart
[2:14:31] can be so stirred up that you could put
[2:14:34] your spiritual eyes and see there's a
[2:14:37] modern event of the calling out of the
[2:14:39] Bride of the manifestation of Jesus
[2:14:42] Christ in a minority group father and
[2:14:45] and I I feel I'm
[2:14:49] part of that being made
[2:14:51] clear that explains
[2:14:55] me it explains why I'm the way I
[2:14:58] am it explains me why I feel the way I
[2:15:04] feel it defines
[2:15:08] me oh that that's such a
[2:15:11] joy it's such a peace not from the
[2:15:15] standpoint of condemnation sure I got
[2:15:18] all this worldly baggage but the
[2:15:22] prophecy is that I'll come
[2:15:25] out the prophecy is I'll overcome the
[2:15:29] prophecy that I'll have Isa to see the
[2:15:33] prophecy is I'll have white rain it the
[2:15:36] prophecy is that I'll be have gold tried
[2:15:39] in
[2:15:41] fire that's what's
[2:15:43] prophesied that's what's taking place in
[2:15:46] me we don't want a denomination and
[2:15:49] Creed it it's living Living Word
[2:15:52] unfolding Living Word and he goes on to
[2:16:00] say and he goes on and talks about
[2:16:02] interpretation and God that man puts his
[2:16:04] interpretation we know that he says but
[2:16:07] this he says but God does his own
[2:16:10] interpreting of his
[2:16:13] word so the first thing is it's not
[2:16:16] going to be
[2:16:19] intellectual God interp pets his word by
[2:16:22] bringing it to pass so it's not
[2:16:26] something that's intellectual it's not a
[2:16:28] philosophy it's actually
[2:16:34] events things that are taking
[2:16:38] place it is not
[2:16:41] psychology and
[2:16:43] philosophy where people are trying to
[2:16:46] rearrange your thinking this is
[2:16:49] something that is prophesied that now is
[2:16:53] manifesting in
[2:16:55] flesh it's taking on
[2:17:02] form it's in human
[2:17:06] flesh he that doesn't believe that the
[2:17:08] word is made
[2:17:10] flesh is
[2:17:12] Antichrist amen and there is anti word
[2:17:16] right that this is not going to remain
[2:17:19] an Ethics or a a mind choice but this is
[2:17:23] a word that was prophecy that's Al
[2:17:26] absolutely going to take physical form
[2:17:31] and be alive right
[2:17:34] [Music]
[2:17:35] hallelujah thank you
[2:17:37] Lord and you got say that's
[2:17:40] me well I got a long ways to go yeah but
[2:17:43] you got a great big God
[2:17:47] hallelujah he's able to bring to pass
[2:17:50] what he he said Thank You Lord but I I
[2:17:53] see it
[2:17:56] amen then I can now I'm saying make that
[2:18:00] clear make it come to pass in
[2:18:03] me because along with everything else
[2:18:06] bad that's going on there is an elect
[2:18:09] lady a group of people that God is going
[2:18:14] to live
[2:18:18] in and he'll provide the Grace the
[2:18:22] strength the mercy the spirit the word
[2:18:26] the instruction to hover over her until
[2:18:29] she comes into that fullness and he will
[2:18:32] not lose the
[2:18:35] one so don't get
[2:18:40] discouraged there's many a time in my
[2:18:42] life I F finally thought I had
[2:18:44] everything pretty good
[2:18:46] shape and then he'll just show me some
[2:18:49] other flaw
[2:18:51] in
[2:18:53] me and I thought oh my goodness no Lord
[2:18:57] surely I'm not that way surely I haven't
[2:18:59] said that surely I haven't done that and
[2:19:02] all of a sudden he draws a whole new
[2:19:03] painting of a lot of the things that I
[2:19:06] had done said and
[2:19:11] thought well I'm not going to say I just
[2:19:14] give
[2:19:15] up you know what I do I go to working on
[2:19:19] them I go without overcoming
[2:19:22] them you know here I go again Lord I've
[2:19:26] always had two feet in my mouth and I've
[2:19:28] done it again I've done it again I they
[2:19:31] they misunderstood me again you know
[2:19:34] when is my you know
[2:19:39] what I might not
[2:19:43] be what I ought to be but I'm not what I
[2:19:47] used to be either
[2:19:51] I know the
[2:19:53] prophecy is being
[2:19:57] fulfilled I know it
[2:19:59] is I no matter what's in my
[2:20:03] past no what my failures are no matter
[2:20:07] what my failures have
[2:20:11] caused that is
[2:20:14] no reason and may I say it like this
[2:20:18] unbelief doesn't stop stop God not their
[2:20:23] unbelief my unbelief hasn't stopped God
[2:20:28] and that's why he said Lord help my
[2:20:32] unbelief he said Do You Love Me Lord you
[2:20:36] love you love me yes Lord you love me
[2:20:38] when he said it the third time Peter
[2:20:41] finally said it this way Lord you know
[2:20:44] all things you know I love you I know I
[2:20:47] denied you I know I did all these things
[2:20:50] but you you know that I love
[2:20:55] you you know what Lord he put that to
[2:20:58] rest in Peter that's right that it could
[2:21:01] never come back and haunt Peter
[2:21:04] again beautiful they got it taken care
[2:21:08] of and if you ever take care of
[2:21:11] something with God you leave it
[2:21:15] there and let's close on this remark
[2:21:20] God does his own interpreting of his
[2:21:23] word he promised the thing and then does
[2:21:27] it
[2:21:31] him he promised a bride he's going to do
[2:21:34] it
[2:21:37] himself he gives
[2:21:40] himself the interpretation of it because
[2:21:45] He makes himself known in that hour Now
[2:21:50] list this statement came to my
[2:21:52] heart how far the body of Christ is
[2:21:58] Advanced from the feet to the
[2:22:01] Head what is one of the
[2:22:05] prophecies in our day is the
[2:22:10] advancement of the body of
[2:22:13] Christ what prophesied for each of us is
[2:22:17] the
[2:22:18] advancement of Our Lives lives in
[2:22:23] Christ and and when he first opened when
[2:22:26] he first began this to speak right right
[2:22:30] in the first thing he said for the Bible
[2:22:32] is the living fortold witness of Jesus
[2:22:35] Christ as the Earth has growed into its
[2:22:39] fullness and also Vines grow into their
[2:22:44] fullness the day grows in to its
[2:22:47] fullness
[2:22:51] it grows into its
[2:22:53] fullness praise God what are we doing
[2:22:56] we're
[2:23:00] growing we're we're we're we're we're
[2:23:04] fulfilling we're a part of an event
[2:23:08] that's taking place right now the
[2:23:10] calling out of the
[2:23:12] Bride the growing of that
[2:23:16] bride and the
[2:23:18] transforming of the seed that God put in
[2:23:21] you into the purpose that it was called
[2:23:25] for praise God can we judge one another
[2:23:28] I say no are we perfect in our own eyes
[2:23:33] no but in his eyes we never did it in
[2:23:38] the first
[2:23:45] place why because he spoke it that's
[2:23:49] right and now it's word meeing
[2:23:55] word and and all I can say church is
[2:23:59] that yeah we're living in a terrible
[2:24:03] miserable atmosphere on
[2:24:07] hour but he that is in you is greater
[2:24:12] than he who is in the
[2:24:15] world and though you can list all your
[2:24:18] failures
[2:24:20] we had just heard that what God
[2:24:23] prophesies will never
[2:24:28] fail and if he prophesied a bride called
[2:24:33] from the Far Corners of the earth called
[2:24:36] from the highways and
[2:24:38] byways
[2:24:40] called from every failure in
[2:24:45] life and that he would perfect it cuz he
[2:24:48] said he whose start the work will finish
[2:24:52] it hallelujah thank you Lord I hope that
[2:24:56] you can look and say that
[2:25:00] event that prophecy is being made
[2:25:05] clear in
[2:25:10] me I'm in his
[2:25:13] hands sometimes he takes the vessel and
[2:25:15] tears it down and rebuilds it but he's
[2:25:19] the Potter
[2:25:21] and I'm the
[2:25:24] clay and he knows what he's doing not my
[2:25:28] will but thy will be done so I want to
[2:25:33] encourage you this
[2:25:35] morning don't get all
[2:25:38] discouraged about the darkness that's
[2:25:42] surrounding
[2:25:43] you but be encouraged about the light
[2:25:48] that's growing in you amen
[2:25:50] and and look at
[2:25:53] yourself I I'll guarantee you you
[2:25:55] wouldn't be here this morning if that
[2:25:58] wasn't your heart's desire amen thank
[2:26:02] you and we could look around this room
[2:26:04] and how many of us have been serving God
[2:26:07] for so many years some a lot of years
[2:26:10] some a few years but you find me the man
[2:26:14] that has finally come to the place that
[2:26:16] he no longer feels he needs to grow and
[2:26:20] Christ he no longer feels that he needs
[2:26:23] to grow in Perfection and be more loving
[2:26:27] be more merciful be more kind do more
[2:26:31] works you find me a man that doesn't
[2:26:34] have that Burning Heart and I'll show
[2:26:37] you a spiritual
[2:26:43] corpse you know where we want to come to
[2:26:47] we want to come to the place that we're
[2:26:49] so Christlike like that we could change
[2:26:57] bodies and our lives would go on just
[2:27:01] the
[2:27:04] same that I I could actually
[2:27:07] switch into
[2:27:09] Billy and Billy could show up and still
[2:27:12] be
[2:27:14] me because I'd be acting the same way
[2:27:18] saying the same thing believing the same
[2:27:21] way being led by The Same
[2:27:24] Spirit then it would have nothing to do
[2:27:26] with the
[2:27:28] outside it would be the
[2:27:31] inside and all of a sudden Billy shows
[2:27:33] up to court for me pay my
[2:27:39] ticket and the judge says well you you
[2:27:43] don't look like David
[2:27:45] M but you sound like them you act like
[2:27:49] them you think like
[2:27:52] them and then Billy say your
[2:27:55] honor it's it's not me that speaketh but
[2:27:58] it's Christ in me that
[2:28:05] speaketh that Jud would look at him and
[2:28:07] say what's going on
[2:28:09] here how does this happen because it's
[2:28:12] the same
[2:28:13] Spirit the same
[2:28:17] mind we're possessed by the same same
[2:28:20] thing we're all part of the same
[2:28:25] prophetic
[2:28:26] event that's
[2:28:29] unfolding of the calling out and
[2:28:32] manifestation of the Bride of Jesus
[2:28:34] Christ God bless you brother EJ if you
[2:28:37] get ready to come be baptized and Bill
[2:28:41] Le if you have to go that's fine uh

[2:29:04] trust that the Lord will be with us and

[2:29:08] church it's fine if you maybe go into
[2:29:11] the room if you want to to wait between
[2:29:14] things but try not to get in the way of

[2:42:14] the same Jesus whom ye have crucified
[2:42:17] both Lord and Christ
[2:42:20] now when they heard this they were
[2:42:22] pricked in their heart and said unto
[2:42:25] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[2:42:28] and Brethren what shall we do then Peter
[2:42:31] said unto them repent and be baptized
[2:42:35] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[2:42:38] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[2:42:41] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:42:45] for This Promise is unto you and to your
[2:42:47] children to all them that are far off
[2:42:50] even as many as our Lord Our God shall
[2:42:53] call and with many other words did he

[2:42:59] yourselves from this upt
[2:43:01] generation
