[30:31] amen hallelujah so good to be in his
[30:35] presence
[30:37] man let's just go ahead and turn in the
[30:38] word
[30:41] i mean what an opportunity that we have
[30:46] to come together
[30:51] just to be able to worship him
[30:56] and not just worship him but worship him
[30:58] in spirit and in truth
[31:09] it's nice to talk to people when they
[31:11] know what they're talking about
[31:14] you know sometimes you talk to people
[31:16] and you realize they don't know what
[31:17] they're talking about
[31:19] but oh my somebody's ever experienced
[31:22] the grace of god
[31:24] you've ever been set free from sin if
[31:26] you ever were down in that muck in that
[31:28] mire and you were
[31:29] lost in trespasses and sin and you've
[31:32] been set free
[31:33] and you're talking to somebody who's
[31:35] experienced it you can tell they know
[31:37] what they're talking about
[31:38] and it's good to be gathered into a
[31:40] house of believers who know what they're
[31:41] talking about
[31:43] not anything that we've done because of
[31:44] what he's done
[31:46] that's why we worship him that's why
[31:47] we've given praise
[31:49] because we've experienced it we know
[31:51] firsthand
[31:52] firsthand revelation amen let's just
[31:55] read in our bibles we're going to be
[31:56] reading revelations chapter 2.
[32:08] we'll be reading verse 17
[32:13] it says he that hath an ear let him hear
[32:16] what the spirit saith
[32:17] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[32:21] will i give to eat of the hidden manna
[32:24] and will give him a white stone and in
[32:26] the stone a new name written
[32:28] which no man knoweth saving he that
[32:30] receiveth it
[32:32] heavenly father we just approach you now
[32:34] as we've read your word
[32:36] we're certainly looking to you lord the
[32:38] author of this word and the finisher
[32:41] of our faith lord that you would come
[32:42] amongst us lord
[32:45] that you would have the preeminence in
[32:46] your people or that you would have the
[32:48] preeminence in this vessel
[32:50] and the ears of the here lord we know
[32:53] how
[32:53] satan would want to disrupt the service
[32:56] we know how easy it is to be distracted
[32:58] but lord you're worthy of our attention
[33:01] lord you're worthy of this time
[33:04] so lord may we all just agree in unity
[33:07] together
[33:08] to look to the supernatural to look to
[33:10] the unseen to come
[33:12] and manifest itself in the scene lord
[33:14] that you would just speak words of life
[33:16] speak words of deliverance lord that you
[33:19] would answer
[33:20] questions lord you would bring forth
[33:22] manifested promises
[33:23] lord healing in the body lord we we
[33:27] we know lord and have seen and can
[33:28] testify that you have done these things
[33:31] in the past lord and
[33:32] by expectation and by divine promise
[33:35] lord we stand looking for you to do it
[33:36] again
[33:37] we just love you lord we ask these
[33:39] things in your name the lord jesus
[33:40] christ
[33:41] amen amen you may be seated
[33:48] man i just uh in in using this
[33:52] uh text here out of revelations
[33:57] 2 um just something that kind of struck
[34:00] my heart here as i was
[34:02] i was reading the bible that says he
[34:04] that happened here
[34:06] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[34:07] the churches it says to him that
[34:09] overcome
[34:11] will i give to eat of the hidden manna
[34:14] and it just struck me in my heart as i
[34:16] was thinking upon that
[34:18] it says to him that overcometh
[34:21] and of course we know that we can only
[34:23] come overcome because christ
[34:25] has already overcome for us but in
[34:28] saying that we're all on the same basis
[34:31] that he put adam and eve on
[34:33] and that's free moral agency and so we
[34:36] all have a choice to make
[34:37] we all have decisions that we must make
[34:40] every single day
[34:42] and as i was just thinking on this and
[34:44] it says to him that overcometh
[34:47] the lord just started dealing with my
[34:48] heart in in the part that i play in that
[34:51] you know because um we have
[34:55] choices to make every single day and we
[34:58] must
[34:58] walk in the spirit that we don't give in
[35:02] to the things of the flesh and the lust
[35:04] of the flesh
[35:05] and there's something that the
[35:07] individual
[35:08] has to do every single day to commit his
[35:11] ways unto the lord
[35:13] to overcome we can't just wake up and
[35:15] say well god
[35:17] you know you said i was an overcomer and
[35:20] i'm just going to wait
[35:22] for that to happen and then we don't
[35:24] have any part in it
[35:25] you know the prophet said god's not just
[35:27] going to put us in a pipe
[35:29] and stuff us through there and pull us
[35:31] out on the other side and say
[35:32] hey good job you're an overcomer but no
[35:35] to him that overcometh that means
[35:37] we're going to have some tests we're
[35:39] going to have some trials we're going to
[35:40] have some adversities we're going to
[35:42] face some things
[35:44] in our everyday life where we're going
[35:46] to have to make some hard decisions
[35:48] we're going to have to make some hard
[35:50] choices
[35:50] and we're going to have to overcome look
[35:53] how many times have you have you
[35:56] come down to a decision or it seems like
[35:58] satan's buffeting against your flesh
[36:00] you know it doesn't feel like you're all
[36:02] anointed with the fire of god and you're
[36:04] just on the mountaintop saying bring it
[36:05] on devil
[36:06] but no it comes at the times where
[36:08] you've been worn down and the kids have
[36:10] gotten on your last nerve and
[36:12] and somebody at work was just was which
[36:14] you know get
[36:15] just getting to the last uh a part of
[36:18] you where you just felt like you're at a
[36:19] snapping place
[36:21] and my you're just doing your best and
[36:22] then you come home and and you think
[36:25] you think you're finally going to get
[36:26] home into a haven of rest and you're
[36:28] going to put your feet up and relax and
[36:29] you get home and it just seems like the
[36:31] wife's been
[36:31] having a hard time with the kids and
[36:33] people are fussing
[36:35] and oh my everything's uh just going on
[36:37] that you know
[36:38] it's in those times where you start to
[36:40] find out your characters being molded in
[36:42] those little things
[36:44] where satan will come in and and try to
[36:46] cause thoughts and reactions
[36:48] you know those are times that we got
[36:49] overcome
[36:52] and that's a decision look when the
[36:53] prophet gives that most beautiful
[36:55] example of how he he came home and it
[36:57] seemed like the house was
[36:58] the atmosphere there wasn't so nice and
[37:00] brother brandon put on an apron
[37:02] uh on an apron he started helping uh
[37:04] sister mita there with the dishes and
[37:06] asking about her day and
[37:07] and what did he do he changed the
[37:09] atmosphere he changed the situation what
[37:12] was it he was being an overcomer
[37:15] that was something he had to do that was
[37:18] a choice he had to make
[37:20] and just what god really just was which
[37:23] just
[37:24] uh really struck my heart as i looked at
[37:27] this to him that overcometh
[37:29] will i give the eat of the hidden manna
[37:31] look there's deeper things in
[37:33] in the word of god that i want i want
[37:36] more revelation
[37:37] i don't got it all figured out this word
[37:40] it's so deep
[37:41] it's so vast it's so wonderful it seems
[37:45] like the more revelation you get the
[37:46] more you realize you don't know
[37:48] it seems like when god opens up
[37:50] something to you you just see him how
[37:51] vast
[37:52] it is and you're like my that's right
[37:55] and i say i want to know these things
[37:58] lord i want to know your person i want
[38:00] i want to to know everything about your
[38:02] kingdom lord that you would have
[38:04] for me i want to know it by revelation
[38:07] lord i don't i don't want to know it
[38:08] just by intellect
[38:11] i want the deep things lord i want all
[38:13] that you have for me
[38:17] and the lord's saying okay what are you
[38:20] doing
[38:21] to get that you know when you think of a
[38:25] couple and
[38:26] and sometimes you know couples have
[38:29] some have more uh adversity to overcome
[38:32] to to maybe
[38:34] uh be together some by long distance you
[38:36] know i i mean some
[38:38] one of our precious brothers here's
[38:40] married and his wife hasn't been able to
[38:42] join them from overseas and you just
[38:44] you imagine uh uh the effort that has to
[38:47] be put in
[38:48] uh to maintain long-distance
[38:50] relationships and maybe when you're
[38:51] courting somebody
[38:52] might you carve out time it's the only
[38:55] thing that matters
[38:56] nothing else matters i just want to talk
[38:58] uh to to the love of my life and
[39:01] and you sacrifice things
[39:04] why isn't that amazing how when
[39:06] something has the first place in your
[39:07] life you make sacrifices
[39:10] you're like man i i that that just
[39:11] doesn't mean as much as it used to mean
[39:13] too many
[39:14] me anymore because i want to take the
[39:15] time because i want to talk to my bride
[39:18] i want to talk to my wife you know i
[39:20] went through the day working today you
[39:22] know and
[39:23] and i haven't talked to her in a little
[39:24] bit a while and and maybe i had this
[39:26] little plan or maybe this little
[39:28] thing's pulling on me but you know what
[39:29] that can wait
[39:31] but i wonder if if we've allowed
[39:34] or walk with the lord to get to such a
[39:36] place
[39:37] or where we don't carve out time for the
[39:39] lord anymore
[39:41] we're not overcoming on a daily basis to
[39:44] eat the hidden manna
[39:46] look there's a table spread full oh my
[39:48] there's never been a table
[39:50] spread with supernatural food like this
[39:52] ever before in the history of man
[39:55] where the seals have been revealed and
[39:57] christ the mystery of god
[39:58] revealed has come and unveil himself to
[40:00] his bride
[40:01] oh what do you want to know in the
[40:03] scriptures do you have
[40:05] questions the bridegroom's standing
[40:08] saying
[40:09] what what what what do you want to know
[40:11] sweetheart
[40:13] what what what do you want to talk about
[40:15] today
[40:17] what's important to you whatever's
[40:19] important to you so we are that's
[40:20] important to me
[40:22] i want to know
[40:25] i want to know do you do do you want to
[40:28] know uh do you want to know more about
[40:29] the seals and the seventh seal

[40:34] threefold manner and i i mentioned a
[40:36] preaching on a fold oven it's a
[40:37] threefold man do you want to know more
[40:40] do you even care do you care that the

[44:37] secrets you want to know more about the
[44:39] mysteries you want to know more about
[44:41] what i had in the back part of my mind
[44:43] before the world was ever formed
[44:46] yes lord this is
[44:49] just expressing my heart of what god was
[44:52] speaking to me
[44:53] yes lord i want to know more what are
[44:56] you doing
[44:58] what are you doing to find out more
[45:02] well i realized maybe lord i'm
[45:06] not making the right decision many times
[45:08] and
[45:10] i realize i want to start carving out
[45:12] more time for prayer
[45:14] i want to start carving out more time
[45:17] for your word
[45:19] i want to start letting you have the
[45:22] first place
[45:24] i want to start letting you have the
[45:26] preeminence lord
[45:28] i realize in my life that as much as
[45:31] you've done for me and you filled me
[45:33] with your holy spirit and
[45:34] i've just been on fire and i've been
[45:36] running and i love your gospel but
[45:38] i realized you get down the road a
[45:40] little bit and you realize i haven't
[45:41] prayed as much as i should have prayed
[45:44] i haven't gotten that secret place into
[45:47] the shekinah glory where i speak to you
[45:49] and you speak back
[45:51] oh have you ever gotten to that place
[45:54] have you ever entered in where it seems
[45:56] like it's eternal
[45:57] oh my lord and you're in the shekinah
[45:59] glory in the world's faded away
[46:01] and nothing else matters oh you're in a
[46:04] place that could stay and sustain you
[46:05] for all eternity
[46:08] or read about the prophet talking about
[46:11] kneeling in the woods
[46:14] these aren't clean uninfested
[46:17] insect free woods
[46:22] but the mosquitoes fighting the chiggers
[46:25] the ticks
[46:28] the noise the snakes the bugs picking
[46:31] away at the flesh
[46:33] but the flesh didn't matter anymore i
[46:37] must hear from god
[46:40] have we gotten to that place where the
[46:43] flesh doesn't matter anymore
[46:45] but the only thing that matters is
[46:47] hearing from god
[46:49] well i believe that what god is wanting
[46:52] his bride to do is come to a place
[46:54] where all this little bag of bulls just
[46:56] doesn't matter anymore
[47:00] oh you look at the sin and the condition
[47:02] of the world
[47:05] my it's getting worse it's getting worse
[47:08] now now mobs of people are actually
[47:11] forcing
[47:12] by force other people to agree with them
[47:17] if you don't make the gesture and if you
[47:19] don't agree with our cause
[47:22] and they're getting all up in their
[47:23] faces and they're intimidating with fear
[47:27] and many people are just giving in just
[47:29] to let it go do you realize what's
[47:31] setting up
[47:34] do you realize how easy this can switch
[47:37] to where state
[47:39] and and religion unites once again and
[47:42] they're right there in your face
[47:44] challenging you on your doctrine and
[47:47] saying if you don't agree with me
[47:51] we'll kill you are we gonna wait for
[47:54] that are we gonna wait
[47:56] until it gets worse and worse and worse
[47:58] then we finally go well
[47:59] okay the flesh doesn't matter anymore
[48:03] i think i'll get down to business and
[48:05] and pray
[48:06] you might find out it's too late
[48:10] noah didn't wait for it to start raining
[48:12] to build an ark
[48:14] and he didn't wait for it to start
[48:15] raining to get on the ark
[48:18] and i think a lot of us if we're not
[48:20] careful we're waiting for
[48:22] things to happen to fulfill prophecy
[48:25] before we get our house in order
[48:27] before we start getting serious until we
[48:29] start praying
[48:30] we're starting to wait for that
[48:31] ecumenical move to to match up and we're
[48:34] we're waiting for the squeeze to come
[48:35] down and we're waiting for certain
[48:37] manifestations
[48:38] and then we're going to get our house in
[48:39] order and then we're going to really get
[48:41] down and study out the seals and see
[48:43] what it's all about
[48:44] and then we're going to really try to
[48:45] get all of our ducks in a row sale i'm
[48:47] going in a body
[48:48] change you better watch out
[48:51] oh the prophet preached the message
[48:53] warning of that
[48:55] you've got a choice to make what are you
[48:58] waiting for
[49:01] are we going to wait till this just gets
[49:03] so bad
[49:06] so miserable
[49:10] until the atomic bomb is on its way
[49:14] you know wait for a news report like
[49:15] well it's on the way let's
[49:17] let's get down and pray honey oh god
[49:19] forbid let's do it now church
[49:21] let's get down to business to him that
[49:24] overcometh
[49:26] will i give the eat of the hidden manna
[49:28] oh that's
[49:29] christ the word the secret things of god
[49:32] that's been hid
[49:33] up before the foundation of the world
[49:35] but now has made manifest to the elect
[49:37] oh i want to feed on those things lord
[49:40] reveal your person to me
[49:46] the prophet says jesus said man shall
[49:48] not live by bread alone
[49:51] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[49:52] the mouth of god
[49:54] is that right so then if man is to live
[49:57] and they are the flock of god the church
[49:59] then they are
[49:59] to thrive upon the word and manna of god
[50:05] this is his manna in the bible we just
[50:07] come through it over
[50:08] there in the church ages jesus is
[50:12] the hidden manner christ is the church's
[50:15] manna
[50:16] what is manna man in the old testament
[50:20] was that what come down from heaven
[50:22] fresh
[50:25] every night to sustain the church in its
[50:27] journey is that right
[50:29] now in the new testament what is the
[50:31] hidden manna
[50:33] a little while and the world seeth me no
[50:37] more
[50:38] hidden yet ye shall see me
[50:42] for i'll be with you even in you to the
[50:45] end of the world
[50:47] and christ is that hidden manna that
[50:50] comes from god
[50:51] out of heaven afresh every day
[50:55] every day we can't say
[50:58] well two weeks ago i had a great
[51:01] experience
[51:02] with god what about right now
[51:07] what about tonight
[51:12] every day fresh a new blessing
[51:16] a new something coming from god the
[51:18] hidden man are coming down from god out
[51:20] of heaven christ
[51:22] and we feast upon this manna which is
[51:24] christ and he sustains us
[51:26] through the journey till we reach the
[51:29] land
[51:30] on the other side what about right now
[51:34] what about tonight i say lord jesus
[51:37] may we have an experience tonight may
[51:40] your holy ghost and power come to where
[51:42] i'm sitting
[51:43] may you come to my heart lord may your
[51:46] word open
[51:46] up to me lord i'm an expectation i'm
[51:49] listening to the call lord i want this
[51:52] manna i want this hidden manner i'm
[51:54] wanting to know what it's all about lord
[51:56] i don't want to be looking back to an
[51:58] experience two weeks ago
[52:01] hey this this preaches to all of us
[52:06] and i mean i think the fact that he says
[52:08] two weeks ago might be a little bit of a
[52:10] rebuke
[52:12] i think some of us go two weeks two
[52:14] months
[52:15] two years now if you've been praying and
[52:20] seeking
[52:22] the lord through those two years you
[52:23] don't be discouraged
[52:25] but if you're not doing anything about
[52:27] it look we go through dry times
[52:30] where you're you're you're crying out to
[52:33] god you feel like your prayer is not
[52:35] going through the ceiling you're doing
[52:36] everything you can you're praying you're
[52:37] reading you go to church
[52:38] you're testifying and you just feel like
[52:40] you can't get an answer you feel like
[52:42] god won't talk to you well you keep
[52:45] believing because you're doing what the
[52:46] word said do you're just going through a
[52:48] test
[52:48] and you know what you're actually doing
[52:50] you're overcoming
[52:52] that's overcoming when you don't feel it
[52:55] when you don't feel like praying when
[52:57] you don't feel like going to church
[52:59] when you don't feel like testing
[53:01] testifying and you do it anyways
[53:02] now you're talking about an overcomer
[53:04] well it's easy to go on down to the camp
[53:06] services and get everybody together in a
[53:08] pep rally and those things are wonderful
[53:10] and the power of god comes around
[53:12] and everybody gets stirred up oh it's
[53:14] good to come to the special services but
[53:16] how many of us are living camp to camp
[53:18] how many of us are living service to
[53:20] service is sunday
[53:22] or the only time that you get into the
[53:24] presence of god
[53:25] oh god help us you realize that you can
[53:28] enter in
[53:29] to the presence of god and receive fresh
[53:32] manna
[53:32] every single day it's a promise to you
[53:36] you can have it if you desire and if you
[53:38] overcome to get it
[53:40] to him that overcometh i will give to
[53:43] eat of the hidden manna
[53:46] oh christ the word
[53:48] [Music]
[53:49] to him prophet points out when it says
[53:52] to him
[53:54] not to the church to him the individual
[53:58] that overcometh look you were created to
[54:00] be an overcomer
[54:03] you were created to be overcomer
[54:06] i love what our pastor was talking about
[54:09] the evidence
[54:10] of election look that's it's not
[54:11] something you do
[54:13] he made you an overcomer
[54:17] and if god creates something you're
[54:20] going to be an attribute of the creator
[54:23] when god made adam adam was a god son
[54:29] if god has a son
[54:32] it's going to be like god and god has
[54:35] sons and daughters in the last days
[54:39] who have his attributes who have his
[54:41] life
[54:42] who has his characteristics you were
[54:45] born
[54:45] an overcomer you were created an
[54:48] overcomer
[54:50] that's what the scripture says you were
[54:52] created in christ
[54:54] jesus oh my so if
[54:57] if you were created in christ jesus
[55:01] so then that means whatever jesus christ
[55:04] was
[55:05] you were in christ it was in christ that
[55:08] you were created
[55:09] and you came out from christ oh you are
[55:13] the anointed messiah
[55:15] for this day you are the bride you're
[55:18] his great achievement
[55:20] you are his body where is the life of
[55:23] god
[55:25] oh what did the prophet say he said all
[55:27] that was in god
[55:30] he poured into christ the godhead bodily
[55:33] and all that was in christ the god had
[55:36] bodily
[55:36] he poured into the church i want to ask
[55:40] you where's the life of god at
[55:42] where's the power of his resurrection
[55:45] where's the healing virtue
[55:47] where's the spoken word where's the
[55:49] manifested power in the
[55:51] end time it's in you
[55:54] you were created that way
[55:58] oh but you bypassed your theophany
[56:01] you came up in sinful flesh all part of
[56:04] his plan
[56:05] but he placed a little life on the
[56:08] inside of you
[56:09] the prophet talks about when you when
[56:11] you believe in god and
[56:13] and you become saved and you start
[56:14] believing on him he said it's like a
[56:16] little button
[56:17] little button in there that the light of
[56:20] god's word has come to life
[56:22] and it's there inside of you
[56:26] and that little button starts to grow
[56:27] and as you get rid of all the malice and
[56:30] all the strife
[56:31] and all the envy it keeps growing bigger
[56:34] and bigger and bigger that's all you
[56:36] have to do just just keep drinking and
[56:38] pushing out
[56:40] this ain't complicated
[56:44] you were created this way you wonder why
[56:47] you hunger
[56:50] you wonder why you thirst it's the
[56:52] father's good pleasure to give you the
[56:54] kingdom
[56:56] it's that gene attribute of god inside
[56:59] of you calling for expression
[57:02] saying i am a creator i can do all
[57:04] things
[57:06] i'm more than an overcomer i am a
[57:08] conqueror in christ jesus
[57:10] and then we look in the mirror like well
[57:12] i don't see how it doesn't don't
[57:14] stop stop looking at the flesh keep
[57:16] looking at the word
[57:17] keep believing the word keep walking in
[57:19] the word and little
[57:20] by little you'll find out that all those
[57:22] little bits of of the flesh are being
[57:24] chipped away
[57:25] and you're coming into the stature of a
[57:27] perfect man
[57:32] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[57:34] a new creation
[57:36] all things have passed away
[57:40] behold all things are become new
[57:46] well can anybody read that scripture
[57:49] know what they're talking about
[57:53] hey i i've been there don't get me
[57:56] started
[57:56] i'll talk your ear off oh oh
[58:00] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[58:02] a new creature
[58:04] all things have passed away behold all
[58:06] things have become
[58:07] let me tell you a little bit about that
[58:09] i was an old creature once upon a time
[58:11] oh my i fought different i acted
[58:14] different i look different
[58:15] but all of a sudden something happened
[58:17] the transforming power
[58:19] of the holy ghost came into my life and
[58:21] it quickened something in me
[58:22] oh and it changed me old things passed
[58:25] away
[58:26] all things became new all things
[58:29] i didn't think the same i didn't talk
[58:32] the same
[58:33] i didn't dress the same i didn't like
[58:35] the same things
[58:36] i didn't even i'll go to the same places
[58:38] to end anymore why because old things
[58:40] that passed away
[58:41] all things have become new
[58:45] oh my to know the love of god to know
[58:48] what it's like to be quickened
[58:50] from dead unbelief in his word to a
[58:52] resurrected
[58:53] power of the living god living on the
[58:55] inside of you
[58:56] that when satan tries to come and buff
[58:58] it against you in the flesh you actually
[59:00] know what you're talking about
[59:01] i got a resurrected savior living inside
[59:04] of me
[59:04] he conquered you he has the death he has
[59:07] the keys to death
[59:08] hell and the grave and that same life
[59:09] devil that conquered you there he's
[59:11] living inside of me
[59:14] oh that's the kind of power you have
[59:18] you have a resurrection power life on
[59:20] the inside of you
[59:22] you were created in christ jesus that
[59:24] way
[59:26] you're just in a little journey as
[59:28] you're feeding on the hit of manna
[59:30] that's bringing you into the fullness of
[59:32] that expression
[59:36] this flesh isn't the real you
[59:41] love how brother brandon would always
[59:42] talk about the little pond lily
[59:45] you know down there in the muck in the
[59:46] mire well that sun kept pulling on it
[59:49] one day
[59:51] one day you know other things like you
[59:52] know what i'm tired of being around here
[59:54] anymore
[59:55] i think it's i think it's time to turn
[59:57] northward i think it's time to go up
[1:00:00] and what happens that little button if
[1:00:02] you would like that little
[1:00:04] light struck that seed and something
[1:00:06] started to happen it started to be
[1:00:07] germatized
[1:00:08] and it started to sprout but look if
[1:00:11] you're comfortable with where you're at
[1:00:13] if you're comfortable living the way
[1:00:14] you're living it's going to be really
[1:00:16] hard
[1:00:17] to get you to change your circumstance
[1:00:21] it's going to be really hard to get you
[1:00:22] out of the mess you're in but oh
[1:00:24] when you start hungering for change and
[1:00:26] oh when you start realizing you know i
[1:00:28] don't want to live this way anymore
[1:00:29] i've tried over and over and over and i
[1:00:32] i've tried to kick this habit
[1:00:33] and i've tried to overcome this problem
[1:00:35] but i just i can't seem to get over do
[1:00:37] you realize
[1:00:38] that's the seed of god inside of you
[1:00:40] that is crying out for deliverance
[1:00:43] it's crying out to me set free from the
[1:00:45] sin of bondage
[1:00:46] oh because why god is calling for you
[1:00:49] he's
[1:00:49] he's crying out his word and saying come
[1:00:51] out of her my people
[1:00:52] i'll come out of the sin and the bondage
[1:00:54] that you're in i want to bring
[1:00:56] you into higher heights in a deeper
[1:00:57] depth in my word i want to set you free
[1:00:59] from all of the sin and unbelief
[1:01:03] and you just turn and you start looking
[1:01:04] to the word
[1:01:06] you start taking god at his word and say
[1:01:08] you know what
[1:01:10] i i i i'm sure i can only i can only say
[1:01:14] what the word says
[1:01:16] i i know i ain't i know i ain't
[1:01:18] overcoming the devil at every stop
[1:01:20] but you know what the bible says
[1:01:24] the bible said he's made me more than a
[1:01:25] conqueror in jesus christ
[1:01:28] he said i was predestinated he had
[1:01:30] chosen me
[1:01:31] before the foundation of the world that
[1:01:32] i should be holy and without blame
[1:01:34] before him in love
[1:01:36] i am his workmanship created in christ
[1:01:38] jesus
[1:01:39] oh you start standing upon the promises
[1:01:41] of god yes
[1:01:42] yes this message how can i overcome just
[1:01:45] a great inspiration to me
[1:01:47] it says so if we are trying to follow
[1:01:50] the message of the hour
[1:01:52] or at least this part of the message we
[1:01:56] should live constantly in the life of
[1:01:58] christ see
[1:02:00] because if it don't because if it don't
[1:02:03] you lay around
[1:02:05] and know that these things that you're
[1:02:07] supposed to do
[1:02:09] and don't do it the bible said he that
[1:02:12] knoweth to do good
[1:02:13] and doeth it not to him it is sin
[1:02:18] now it necessarily doesn't mean
[1:02:23] that look if you know that god is
[1:02:26] dealing with your heart to do something
[1:02:27] and you don't do it
[1:02:28] it's sin
[1:02:32] now it might not appear on the outside
[1:02:34] to be sin
[1:02:36] but we must be obedient
[1:02:40] to the word of god we must be obedient
[1:02:42] to the call of god in our life
[1:02:45] then he says he that knoweth to do good
[1:02:48] and doeth it not to him it's sin
[1:02:49] then you become dodie rotten when you're
[1:02:53] separated from the life of god
[1:02:55] it says so strive with all that's in you
[1:03:00] to stay in the life of christ
[1:03:03] that you would be fruit bearing
[1:03:07] strive with all that you mean i you mean
[1:03:09] i have to do something
[1:03:11] yes you need to strive with all that's
[1:03:14] in you to stay in the life of christ
[1:03:17] that you would be fruit bearing
[1:03:19] and as i looked at this i started to
[1:03:21] think about how the prophet would always
[1:03:22] say
[1:03:23] uh uh you know wanting brother brandon
[1:03:25] maybe to or to go into the deep things
[1:03:27] or
[1:03:28] or stuff like that he goes how how in
[1:03:30] the world am i ever going to teach them
[1:03:31] algebra if they don't know their abcs
[1:03:35] well i think i think sometimes we're
[1:03:36] struggling a lot with our abcs
[1:03:41] i think a lot of us reason why we can't
[1:03:44] go on and do algebra
[1:03:46] we haven't gotten our abcs down always
[1:03:49] believe
[1:03:49] christ but there used to be something to
[1:03:52] a consecrated holy life of prayer
[1:03:55] there used to be something to a life
[1:03:57] that would abstain from the appearance
[1:03:59] of evil
[1:03:59] there used to be something to the life
[1:04:01] that wouldn't give in to all the little
[1:04:03] uh flirt
[1:04:04] flirting temptations that the devil
[1:04:06] whips around in all of these devices
[1:04:08] that he's created in this day
[1:04:10] but oh we just entertain it all
[1:04:14] i think i think some of us we need to
[1:04:17] check up and start to realize the reason
[1:04:19] why we can't do algebra is because we
[1:04:21] don't even know our abcs
[1:04:24] and this is where we start this is where
[1:04:26] it starts coming down to
[1:04:29] it's faithful in the little things
[1:04:32] we see this age that we're living in
[1:04:35] it's one of the grandest ages of
[1:04:37] all ages the lady will see a church age
[1:04:41] is the the grandest of all church ages
[1:04:43] because it's the ending of time
[1:04:45] and the blending of eternity and then
[1:04:48] it's the greatest sinful age
[1:04:50] it's more sin in this age than there's
[1:04:52] ever been and the
[1:04:54] powers of satan is many times harder to
[1:04:56] fight against
[1:04:57] than it was in any other age see here
[1:05:00] back
[1:05:01] there in early ages a christian could
[1:05:03] for his profession of being
[1:05:05] being a belonging to christ could be
[1:05:07] beheaded for it
[1:05:09] he could be killed and put out of his
[1:05:11] misery and go to meet god quickly
[1:05:13] but now the enemy has come in in the
[1:05:16] name of the church
[1:05:18] and it's so deceiving this is
[1:05:21] the great age of deception
[1:05:25] when christ said so two spirits would be
[1:05:28] so close
[1:05:30] in the last days till it would deceive
[1:05:32] the very elect
[1:05:33] if it was possible c see remember
[1:05:36] christ spoke of an elected people
[1:05:39] for the last days see it would deceive
[1:05:42] the very elect if it was possible so
[1:05:45] close
[1:05:46] the people so close
[1:05:50] the people so live now i want you to
[1:05:53] really take heed to this the people so
[1:05:56] that people can live a clean
[1:05:58] holy life not be sinful
[1:06:02] adulterers or drinkers and liars and
[1:06:04] gamblers they can live above that and
[1:06:07] still
[1:06:07] not with him well
[1:06:10] this is the greatest age of deception
[1:06:16] that you could be living a holy life
[1:06:20] you could be abstaining from all the
[1:06:22] things
[1:06:23] that the devil is trying to throw at you
[1:06:25] and you can
[1:06:26] actually be missing it he says not with
[1:06:29] it but you say by believers
[1:06:31] oh not me brother yes you me all of us
[1:06:34] if we're not careful we get caught up
[1:06:37] into thinking just because we're
[1:06:39] abstaining we're relying on works
[1:06:42] but no we want to go past works we want
[1:06:45] to overcome and come into a place
[1:06:47] where we're feeding on the hidden man of
[1:06:49] god and we're not relying on some
[1:06:51] experience from the past
[1:06:52] but we're having a fresh experience
[1:06:55] every single day i say oh god i want
[1:06:57] that lord jesus
[1:06:59] help me god to die out every single day
[1:07:02] and be a true
[1:07:03] real overcomer of god that i can have
[1:07:05] that in my life
[1:07:08] let people be able to just see a change
[1:07:11] let them be able to see the evidence of
[1:07:12] that type of life lord
[1:07:15] that they can be hungry for the things
[1:07:16] of god
[1:07:22] people are deceived thinking
[1:07:25] that their works is enough but oh there
[1:07:28] there's more
[1:07:29] there's more for you look i i i i think
[1:07:33] we need to preach you must be born again
[1:07:37] the gospel is you must be born again
[1:07:42] you got to go to calvary
[1:07:46] look cavalry ain't old it ain't an old
[1:07:48] story
[1:07:50] you must be born again in an old gospel
[1:07:53] we got people amongst us and in our body
[1:07:55] that need to be born again
[1:07:59] and i feel that the way somehow the
[1:08:01] devil's
[1:08:02] been able to to spin it is that if
[1:08:05] somebody's hungering and thirsting and
[1:08:07] they want to be born again
[1:08:08] they feel like an outcast like god
[1:08:12] forbid
[1:08:12] i let somebody know that i'm praying and
[1:08:14] hungering to be filled with the holy
[1:08:16] ghost
[1:08:17] my if i let my youth group know that
[1:08:21] oh my i i wouldn't have the badge of
[1:08:24] honor
[1:08:26] oh we're supposed to work out our
[1:08:28] salvation with fear and trembling before
[1:08:30] god
[1:08:31] oh we need we need some folks to get
[1:08:34] hungry
[1:08:35] and get sincere and get down to business
[1:08:37] and realize you know what
[1:08:38] i've been going to church a little while
[1:08:40] i've been listening to the message i've
[1:08:42] gone to some cats
[1:08:43] but you know what this this born again
[1:08:45] this new change this new creature old
[1:08:47] things passing away
[1:08:49] all things become a new i maybe i
[1:08:51] haven't experienced it like i
[1:08:52] i should have come on
[1:08:55] oh this is between life and death
[1:08:59] i had a a friend of mine an acquaintance
[1:09:01] in business
[1:09:03] a really nice man who's been a great
[1:09:05] blessing to me
[1:09:06] uh he has a a a a
[1:09:09] he's a contractor that does uh drainage
[1:09:12] work and landscaping and he he refers a
[1:09:14] lot of work to me he's
[1:09:15] a great blessing he's a christian man
[1:09:18] and uh
[1:09:18] he's god's done some great miracles in
[1:09:21] his life where he's been delivered from
[1:09:22] stage four cancer and
[1:09:23] he had another bout with something here
[1:09:25] not too long ago and and god's just uh
[1:09:27] kept him
[1:09:28] kept him alive and so he he was out in
[1:09:31] florida on vacation
[1:09:33] and uh they they were there on the beach
[1:09:36] and there was a really bad rip tide that
[1:09:38] was coming through
[1:09:39] and they started hearing some people uh
[1:09:42] call for help and they could tell it was
[1:09:43] a bad riptide
[1:09:45] and well he had a young 18 year old son
[1:09:47] he was a little bit more savvy knowing
[1:09:48] that riptide's it's
[1:09:50] you get out matt you're just as helpless
[1:09:51] as they are and
[1:09:53] uh but his son said no i gotta go help
[1:09:55] and he runs off
[1:09:56] into the water and and line's like oh my
[1:09:58] goodness
[1:09:59] so he started to just to make his way
[1:10:01] out there was going to try to stay up on
[1:10:02] the sandbar and before he knew it he got
[1:10:04] swept out there in the sun
[1:10:05] and they're in this riptide and he said
[1:10:07] he he got spun around and twirled around
[1:10:10] and and uh he said you know it's like
[1:10:12] things came into slow motion
[1:10:16] and i just got real calm and i and i
[1:10:19] and i just kind of turned over on my
[1:10:20] back and i was i wasn't going to
[1:10:22] struggle anymore
[1:10:24] and i made peace i knew my son had been
[1:10:26] taken from me
[1:10:28] and i was there and i'm like well i
[1:10:30] guess this is it
[1:10:32] and he said out of nowhere out of
[1:10:35] nowhere all of a sudden somebody pulled
[1:10:37] him up onto a board
[1:10:39] and and got him to shore and they got
[1:10:42] his son out too and they had they'd got
[1:10:44] three or four more but unfortunately i
[1:10:46] believe it was an 11 year old boy they
[1:10:48] they made it out of the water and they
[1:10:50] they were trying to resuscitate him but
[1:10:51] he didn't make it he passed away and
[1:10:53] he was a part of that uh ceremony but
[1:10:56] when i
[1:10:57] when i got back and was talking to lawn
[1:10:59] he was he was
[1:11:00] he was full of a completely different
[1:11:02] perspective
[1:11:04] he had a new perspective on life he's
[1:11:06] like man it's good to be alive
[1:11:08] oh i'm thankful to be alive you know the
[1:11:10] things that i thought mattered they
[1:11:11] really don't matter as much anymore
[1:11:14] why because he had come into a situation
[1:11:17] that was between life or death
[1:11:19] and i want to know you look you're
[1:11:20] between a situation of life or death
[1:11:23] you must be born again and i tell you
[1:11:26] what if a man
[1:11:27] who was just uh coming to terms with
[1:11:30] potentially dying in the natural i tell
[1:11:32] you what
[1:11:32] when you've been set free from spiritual
[1:11:34] death oh you want to talk about a joy
[1:11:37] you want to talk about a house on fire
[1:11:40] nothing can put that fire out
[1:11:41] the devil can throw this trial on you he
[1:11:44] can throw that trial on you he can throw
[1:11:46] that temptation on you he'll bring
[1:11:48] everything he want to do to discourage
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:50] but you are a conqueror through jesus
[1:11:52] christ
[1:11:53] you are more than a conqueror
[1:11:56] why because it's not your life it's his
[1:11:59] life that's living in you
[1:12:12] brother brandon makes a comment about
[1:12:14] self-will
[1:12:18] says self-will is the veil to the
[1:12:22] shekinah glory
[1:12:24] self-will is the veil to go into the
[1:12:26] holy place
[1:12:29] and as we've just said here in the
[1:12:31] outset of being an overcomer
[1:12:35] the prophet says you know the greatest
[1:12:37] enemy that i have
[1:12:39] is william brennan william branham's
[1:12:42] always getting in the way of god
[1:12:45] well i think the prophet's trying to let
[1:12:48] us know something
[1:12:50] the greatest enemy we got the greatest
[1:12:54] enemy i got is matthew mcgeary always
[1:12:56] getting in the way of what god is trying
[1:12:58] to do
[1:13:01] we always allowing ourself will to get
[1:13:03] in the way
[1:13:05] but it's through that self will if we
[1:13:08] can die out to that
[1:13:10] and we can be an overcomer to enter in
[1:13:13] into that secret place and live there
[1:13:15] in the shekinah glory where what the man
[1:13:17] is fresh every single day
[1:13:20] you know what was back there in the
[1:13:21] shekinah glory back during the holiest
[1:13:23] the holy there was the
[1:13:25] aaron's rod was back there the ten
[1:13:27] commandments and there was
[1:13:28] a bowl of manna that the new high priest
[1:13:31] when they come in there they would get a
[1:13:33] hand of fresh manna
[1:13:34] it never went old in the presence of god
[1:13:37] and that's what god is inviting you to
[1:13:39] is to live in that presence
[1:13:41] where you're eating that hidden manna
[1:13:43] where you're feeding on christ the word
[1:13:45] every single
[1:13:46] day of your life if we can just die out
[1:13:48] to self-will
[1:13:49] and enter into that and quit getting in
[1:13:51] god's way
[1:13:56] every overcomer has to be put to the
[1:13:58] test
[1:14:01] what what did the prophet say it means
[1:14:02] to overcome
[1:14:04] to recognize the devil in every single
[1:14:06] one of his tricks
[1:14:09] i say god give me some discernment lord
[1:14:12] i want to be an overcomer
[1:14:14] i want to recognize if you said i can
[1:14:17] recognize every single one of the
[1:14:19] devil's tricks
[1:14:20] and you created me and i'm an overcomer
[1:14:23] then lord
[1:14:23] i'm looking for it i know that you're
[1:14:26] giving me the ability
[1:14:28] by your holy ghost that i can recognize
[1:14:30] the devil
[1:14:31] and every single one of his tricks and
[1:14:33] if the prophet says you got to recognize
[1:14:34] him real
[1:14:36] he says but once you've recognized that
[1:14:38] he's real he said to overcome
[1:14:40] you must recognize that god in you is
[1:14:43] greater
[1:14:44] and mightier than he is and he said and
[1:14:47] by his grace
[1:14:48] you are more than a match for the devil
[1:14:51] oh
[1:14:52] hallelujah you're more than a match for
[1:14:54] the devil
[1:14:55] why because it's christ that's living in
[1:14:57] you
[1:15:01] oh you were predestinated to that first
[1:15:03] john 4
[1:15:04] 4 says year of god little children and
[1:15:07] have overcome them because greater is he
[1:15:09] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:15:11] world
[1:15:12] amen it's not me that liveth but it's
[1:15:15] christ that liveth in you
[1:15:16] it's god working in you both to will and
[1:15:19] to do his good pleasure
[1:15:22] by just picking up on that quote we read
[1:15:26] we got to strive with all that's in you
[1:15:29] to stay in the life of christ
[1:15:32] that you are fruit bearing and we just
[1:15:34] maybe by god's grace just turn a corner
[1:15:36] and we'll just
[1:15:37] we won't be much longer
[1:15:43] but in overcoming he says to the
[1:15:46] overcomer
[1:15:48] i will give to eat the hidden manna
[1:15:51] that's that's kind of what i'm wanting
[1:15:53] to drive to tonight
[1:15:54] is that lord may i get all the abc's may
[1:15:58] i get the self-will out of the way
[1:16:00] may i be carving out time for you lord
[1:16:02] may i may i
[1:16:03] be giving you the first place that you
[1:16:05] might have the preeminence lord
[1:16:07] that that that i can receive and feed on
[1:16:09] this hidden manner
[1:16:14] feed on the secret things of god
[1:16:19] the prophet says he's in mentioning in
[1:16:21] the church age book he says now
[1:16:24] uh referencing malachi 4 and
[1:16:27] revelations 10 7 he says the messenger
[1:16:30] of malachi 4
[1:16:32] and revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:16:35] things
[1:16:36] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:16:39] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:16:41] and 2 he will reveal the mysteries
[1:16:45] of the seven thunders in revelations 10
[1:16:48] which are the revelations contained in
[1:16:50] the seven seals
[1:16:52] he says and it will be these divinely
[1:16:54] revealed mystery truths
[1:16:56] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:16:59] children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:17:01] it'll be these divine revealed mystery
[1:17:04] truths
[1:17:05] what what are you talking about these
[1:17:06] divine mystery truths that were sealed
[1:17:09] away in the seven seals that now
[1:17:11] by divine promise in the very end time
[1:17:13] this hidden secret
[1:17:15] that god has had in his mind all along
[1:17:17] according to revelations 10 7
[1:17:19] at the sounding of the seventh angel
[1:17:21] messenger he would begin to sound and
[1:17:23] all of the mysteries of god would be
[1:17:26] finished oh what
[1:17:27] make it away so you could feed on all of
[1:17:29] the hidden manner of god
[1:17:32] now i want maybe just in here around on
[1:17:35] a sobering note a little bit
[1:17:37] and this really cause us to think the
[1:17:40] prophet of god
[1:17:41] said that when the seals came open he
[1:17:44] said the bible became a new book to him
[1:17:47] is that right now if we're if we just
[1:17:50] think about this maybe a little soberly
[1:17:53] and you think of the prophet and his
[1:17:55] understanding of the word
[1:18:00] for the prophet oh what humility
[1:18:03] oh so many men they're so puffed up they
[1:18:05] would never they would never belittle
[1:18:06] themselves
[1:18:07] hey man after preaching the gospel for
[1:18:11] 30 years
[1:18:12] plus said the bible became a new book to
[1:18:15] me
[1:18:16] oh that's chief wave and humility saying
[1:18:18] you know what
[1:18:19] now that the seals are open the bible's
[1:18:21] become a brand new book something to my
[1:18:23] eyes said lord
[1:18:24] if it became a new book for the prophet
[1:18:26] lord let it become a new book to me
[1:18:29] lord let these mysteries open up i want
[1:18:32] all of it lord
[1:18:33] i want the hidden manna
[1:18:36] oh i dare to even think i had the
[1:18:39] understanding the prophet had pre-63
[1:18:44] and the bible became a new book to him
[1:18:48] say lord reveal the deep things to me
[1:18:51] when i'm ready to be an overcomer not in
[1:18:54] myself lord but i'm ready to take you at
[1:18:56] your word the musicians would come
[1:19:00] we'll just find a place to end here
[1:19:13] you don't have to start playing just yet
[1:19:19] but we just want to tie a couple
[1:19:22] scriptures together here
[1:19:30] i want this message to be alive in me
[1:19:35] i don't want to have to go match quote
[1:19:37] to this quote to that quote and
[1:19:38] try to follow this and chase it down and
[1:19:40] what what did the prophet say about this
[1:19:42] oh but if the message is alive in you
[1:19:45] if the message is in you if the message
[1:19:47] is alive
[1:19:48] you have the devil's answer oh it's
[1:19:51] alive it's living in you
[1:19:53] your bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:19:55] lust you've received the revelation
[1:19:57] it's in you and i say lord i want more
[1:20:01] i want more and more and more reveal the
[1:20:03] deep things oh god
[1:20:10] the hidden manner john 6 51 says i am
[1:20:14] the living bread which come down from
[1:20:16] heaven
[1:20:17] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[1:20:19] live forever and the bread that i will
[1:20:20] give in my flesh
[1:20:22] which i will give for the life of the
[1:20:24] world the jews
[1:20:25] therefore strove among themselves saying
[1:20:27] how can this man
[1:20:29] give us his flesh to eat that's a
[1:20:32] reasonable question
[1:20:34] i mean don't look at these guys like man
[1:20:35] they just don't know what's going on
[1:20:38] reasonable question then jesus said unto
[1:20:41] verily verily i say unto you except you
[1:20:43] eat the flesh of the son of man
[1:20:45] and drink his blood you have no life in
[1:20:47] you he wasn't stopping
[1:20:50] he's going to keep going too whosoever
[1:20:52] eateth my flesh
[1:20:53] and drinketh my gonna be the day you
[1:20:55] witness to somebody and told him to come
[1:20:57] to church
[1:20:58] like oh my goodness
[1:21:02] yeah you know i mean that's our pastor
[1:21:05] that's what we believe hey we might not
[1:21:08] understand everything
[1:21:10] but watch what watch what he comes on
[1:21:12] down and says here
[1:21:13] he says for my flesh is meat indeed
[1:21:16] and my blood is drink indeed he that
[1:21:19] eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
[1:21:21] dwelleth in me and i in him
[1:21:24] you you could see that these people
[1:21:26] would be like what is he talking about
[1:21:28] but you know what the prophet of god
[1:21:29] said he said he said it to stumble them
[1:21:33] he said actually what jesus was doing
[1:21:36] was separating the sheeps from the goats
[1:21:42] oh because the elect my sheep know my
[1:21:45] voice they're not going to hear another
[1:21:46] they're going to be
[1:21:47] just like peter say lord where else will
[1:21:50] we go
[1:21:51] no i don't understand all the mysteries
[1:21:53] no i don't understand all the message
[1:21:56] no i can't make it all add up and
[1:21:58] everything the lord where else am i
[1:22:00] going to go
[1:22:01] this is the words of eternal life this
[1:22:04] is the hidden manner that i want to feed
[1:22:06] on
[1:22:08] oh god knew exactly how this message
[1:22:10] would come forth
[1:22:12] you think that brother branham you know
[1:22:14] not making it through i guess a seventh
[1:22:16] grade education brother
[1:22:17] god was up there going man i was hoping
[1:22:19] to at least get out of 12th grade
[1:22:22] god god orchestrated the steps
[1:22:26] so beautifully to manifest his word
[1:22:30] in the last days
[1:22:34] that the word would come forth in such
[1:22:36] humility
[1:22:38] in such simplicity that it would
[1:22:42] separate
[1:22:42] the sheeps from the goats
[1:22:46] oh some people just couldn't stand to be
[1:22:48] identified with a man
[1:22:49] breaking the bread of life and not
[1:22:51] having an lld and
[1:22:52] this and that i want to just move down
[1:22:56] he says
[1:22:59] oh my
[1:23:04] oh those are comfortable no we
[1:23:07] we will try to finish lord forgive me i
[1:23:09] just we have a lot here but we want to
[1:23:12] try to
[1:23:13] summarize this we didn't want to keep
[1:23:15] you too long
[1:23:21] but just remember to be an overcomer you
[1:23:24] gotta
[1:23:25] you gotta go through test every son and
[1:23:27] daughter that comes to god must be
[1:23:28] tested
[1:23:29] and we're gonna have tests in our every
[1:23:32] day of life
[1:23:33] i think of the story of that woman whose
[1:23:36] daughter was vexed with the devil
[1:23:38] and she finally gets to the lord and the
[1:23:40] lord doesn't even respond to her
[1:23:42] and then she comes again and he says
[1:23:44] it's not meat to give the children's
[1:23:46] bread to dogs
[1:23:48] well you know what jesus was doing
[1:23:51] separating sheep from goats
[1:23:53] because if that would have been a goat
[1:23:55] that goat would have been gone
[1:23:58] but there was something in that woman
[1:24:00] she was a predestinated seed i believe
[1:24:02] something in her soul i have nowhere
[1:24:05] else to go
[1:24:07] lord you alone have the words of eternal
[1:24:08] life and even the dogs eat the crumbs
[1:24:11] from the master's table
[1:24:13] i say oh god if i'm not understanding
[1:24:15] all the rich deep things of your word
[1:24:17] lord
[1:24:17] oh just give me a few crumbs lord a few
[1:24:20] crumbs from your table tonight
[1:24:22] will satisfy my hungry soul
[1:24:28] now in john 4 32
[1:24:33] so what i'm just tying here together is
[1:24:35] he said unless you eat my flesh and
[1:24:37] drink my blood you'll have no part with
[1:24:38] me
[1:24:39] that's still a very mysterious statement
[1:24:43] but we know that he's speaking in a
[1:24:44] spiritual sense
[1:24:46] and a spiritual partaking of his word
[1:24:49] but i like this scene here in john 4
[1:24:51] where it's setting up this is the scene
[1:24:54] of the woman at the well
[1:24:56] and we won't take the time to go through
[1:24:57] such a beautiful story that
[1:24:59] i believe each one of us can identify
[1:25:01] with that predestinated seed responding
[1:25:04] to the word made flesh
[1:25:06] and her saying lord we we know that when
[1:25:07] messiah comes
[1:25:09] he'll show us these things when he says
[1:25:10] i am he oh we can all see that
[1:25:12] identification but
[1:25:13] i want to look at the last part of the
[1:25:15] story here as the disciples now are
[1:25:18] coming up on this
[1:25:18] on this unfolding and this happening and
[1:25:22] they come up
[1:25:23] and you know jesus has sent him away to
[1:25:25] get food
[1:25:26] so now they're coming back with food and
[1:25:28] and uh they're wanting to give him food
[1:25:30] he goes
[1:25:31] but he said unto them i have meat
[1:25:34] to eat that you know not of therefore
[1:25:36] said the disciples one to another
[1:25:38] half any man brought him something to
[1:25:42] eat
[1:25:43] jesus said in him my meat is to do the
[1:25:46] will
[1:25:48] of him that sent me and to
[1:25:51] finish his work my meat
[1:25:54] my food is to do the will of him that
[1:25:58] sent me and his will
[1:25:59] is his word luke 24 42 he says saying
[1:26:03] father
[1:26:03] if thou be willing remove this cup from
[1:26:06] me
[1:26:07] nevertheless not my will be done but
[1:26:10] your will be done look if this was the
[1:26:12] very life
[1:26:13] that was evident in christ jesus it's
[1:26:15] now the same life
[1:26:17] that is evident in the bride of jesus
[1:26:19] christ the bride is saying lord not my
[1:26:22] will
[1:26:22] but thy will be done oh god needs
[1:26:25] prisoners today
[1:26:27] prisoners of his word that regardless of
[1:26:30] what's going on in the world
[1:26:31] they'll stay right there with that word
[1:26:33] like moses
[1:26:35] they'll stay right there with the word
[1:26:36] like the prophet look brother branham
[1:26:38] was a prisoner to the word
[1:26:42] he couldn't do his own will when he
[1:26:45] wanted to do his own will the spirit of
[1:26:47] god
[1:26:47] would come and check him and say no we
[1:26:49] got we got work to do
[1:26:51] he's trying to go down to the post
[1:26:53] office and mail something off
[1:26:55] and go back up and catch an airplane
[1:26:57] ride nope
[1:26:58] oh god help me to get in a place
[1:27:03] of sensitivity to your holy spirit
[1:27:07] where i can be so sensitive to the still
[1:27:09] small voice
[1:27:10] look we make it so big and so
[1:27:12] supernatural way off in the
[1:27:14] uh the yonder that god can't do those
[1:27:16] things in our life he can
[1:27:18] he wants to that was a sheaf wave
[1:27:22] of a whole wheat field coming up behind
[1:27:24] it to manifest the same signs and
[1:27:26] wonders
[1:27:27] to have the same type of leadership and
[1:27:30] and jesus said in
[1:27:31] uh luke 16 10 he said he who is faithful
[1:27:35] and little
[1:27:36] will be faithful much oh god help us to
[1:27:38] start overcoming in the little things
[1:27:41] that the big things might start coming
[1:27:44] in a manifestation
[1:27:46] if you can start playing something let's
[1:27:48] stand
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:58] now
[1:28:00] oh if we can just be prisoners died out
[1:28:03] to self-will
[1:28:11] a prophet in the seventh seal makes a
[1:28:14] statement that really just
[1:28:17] resonated in my heart he said
[1:28:20] you know people in the last days are
[1:28:22] living on a hangover from another age
[1:28:27] that people of these last days is living
[1:28:30] on a
[1:28:30] hangover from the pentecostal age
[1:28:34] do you know the pentecostal age was
[1:28:36] under the intelligence of man
[1:28:38] that was the anointing this
[1:28:42] and the accomplish of man was so
[1:28:44] incredible with the compiling of notes
[1:28:46] and the compiling of
[1:28:47] encyclopedias and and all mapping out
[1:28:50] bibles and scriptures and everything
[1:28:54] but he said that won't work anymore that
[1:28:57] won't do we've come into a higher age
[1:28:59] we've come into the eagle age
[1:29:01] i said oh god may i not be trapped by
[1:29:04] the devil
[1:29:05] into a hangover from another age where
[1:29:08] i'm just trying to garner through the
[1:29:09] message for knowledge
[1:29:12] i'm just trying to comb through the
[1:29:13] message and tie this quote into that
[1:29:15] quote
[1:29:16] well may it be a revelation and then if
[1:29:19] the word
[1:29:20] is a revelation then you're feeding on
[1:29:23] the hidden matter because you are
[1:29:24] performing his will
[1:29:26] what did jesus say he says my meat is to
[1:29:29] do the will
[1:29:31] of him that sent me and his will is his
[1:29:33] word and the prophet of god said
[1:29:36] those in the bride do only his will
[1:29:40] no one can make them do otherwise they
[1:29:42] have thus saith the lord or they keep
[1:29:44] still
[1:29:45] they know that it has to be god in them
[1:29:47] doing the works
[1:29:48] fulfilling his own word he did not
[1:29:50] complete
[1:29:51] all his work while in his earthly
[1:29:54] ministry
[1:29:55] so now he works in and through his bride
[1:29:59] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:30:02] for him to do certain things that he
[1:30:04] must do now
[1:30:05] but he will now fulfill through the
[1:30:08] bride
[1:30:09] that work which he left off for a
[1:30:11] specific time
[1:30:13] all that was in god he poured into
[1:30:15] christ
[1:30:16] and all that was in christ he poured
[1:30:19] into you
[1:30:21] the believer oh just ending on a
[1:30:23] scripture colossians we've been
[1:30:24] fellowshipping on this
[1:30:26] colossians 1 25 even the mystery
[1:30:29] which has been hid from the ages and
[1:30:31] from generations but
[1:30:32] now is made manifest to a saint
[1:30:35] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:30:37] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:30:39] among the gentiles
[1:30:41] which is christ in you
[1:30:44] the hope of glory brother branham says
[1:30:46] in christ the mystery of god revealed he
[1:30:48] says christ
[1:30:49] in you makes you the complete revelation
[1:30:52] of the whole thing
[1:30:53] my christ in you makes you the
[1:30:56] revelation of the whole thing everything
[1:30:58] that god
[1:30:59] was wanting to achieve was first to
[1:31:01] express himself in jesus christ
[1:31:03] and now express himself in a bride out
[1:31:05] of the preeminence what for
[1:31:06] to take us back to eden oh hallelujah
[1:31:10] let's just go before the lord if
[1:31:12] somebody would have a
[1:31:14] something on their heart and just want
[1:31:15] to lift up their hand and say lord
[1:31:18] i realize that
[1:31:21] i can live a better consecrated life
[1:31:23] lord
[1:31:24] i realize that i can do more for you
[1:31:26] lord sometimes i
[1:31:29] i put it all off on you lord like you're
[1:31:31] the one that has to
[1:31:32] make me kneel down to pray and you're
[1:31:34] the one that has to make me open my
[1:31:35] bible
[1:31:37] and lord i don't know why i do it i'm
[1:31:39] i'm hungry and thirsting for more of you
[1:31:42] and for some reason lord in the simple
[1:31:44] things
[1:31:45] just in the little simple abcs of
[1:31:48] getting on my knees and praying
[1:31:50] and opening up my bible and pray lord
[1:31:53] i'm not doing those little things that i
[1:31:55] know i need to be doing
[1:31:56] lord i just lift up my hands but i
[1:31:59] believe your children are lifting up
[1:32:00] their hands say lord
[1:32:02] i'm going to do better not because it's
[1:32:05] something in myself and it's going to be
[1:32:07] some work and
[1:32:08] just my own effort lord but i realize
[1:32:12] your life and me is crying out for more
[1:32:14] it's hungry for more lord and
[1:32:17] i'm just going to die out to myself for
[1:32:19] it i'm going to start making an
[1:32:20] effort to give you the time that you
[1:32:22] deserve and give you the first place
[1:32:24] lord
[1:32:25] and i know in just doing the little
[1:32:26] things lord that these big things these
[1:32:29] desires that i've had in my heart lord
[1:32:32] maybe you've been letting them linger
[1:32:33] around because i haven't been doing the
[1:32:35] small things lord
[1:32:37] so by your grace i'm going to be
[1:32:38] faithful and little lord as you promised
[1:32:40] that i could be faithful
[1:32:41] and much lord we just love you lord we
[1:32:44] commit each one to you
