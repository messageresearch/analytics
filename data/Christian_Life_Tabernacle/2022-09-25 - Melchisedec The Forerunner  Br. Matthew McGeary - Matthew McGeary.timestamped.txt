[27:00] his presence amen
[27:02] thank you musicians if you have your
[27:04] Bibles
[27:10] just turn
[27:12] in our Bibles to Revelations chapter one
[27:25] just read the first six verses there
[27:43] Revelations 1 reads the revelation of
[27:46] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[27:48] show unto his servants things which must
[27:50] shortly come to pass
[27:52] and he sent and signified it by his
[27:54] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[27:57] record of the word of God and of the
[28:00] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[28:02] that he saw blessed is he that readeth
[28:04] and they that hear the words of this
[28:06] prophecy and keep those things which are
[28:09] written therein for the time is at hand
[28:11] and John to the seven churches which are
[28:14] in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[28:16] him which is which was and which is to
[28:18] come and from the seven spirits which
[28:20] are before his throne and from Jesus
[28:22] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[28:25] the first begotten of the dead and the
[28:26] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[28:28] him that is loved and washed us from our
[28:31] sins and his own blood my what what an
[28:34] amazing start and then to think
[28:37] the words that comes in with this great
[28:39] expression that we're reading this great
[28:41] expression of Christ and then
[28:44] verse 6 and hath made us Kings and
[28:46] Priests
[28:49] unto God and his father to him be glory
[28:52] and Dominion forever and ever amen we
[28:55] ask a blessing upon the reading of the
[28:57] word you may be seated if you can also
[28:59] turn over in your Bibles
[29:02] to Genesis chapter 14.
[29:11] read Verse 18 through 20.
[29:20] and Melchizedek king of Salem
[29:23] brought forth Bread and Wine
[29:27] and he was the priest of the most high
[29:30] God
[29:32] now just hold that in your minds
[29:34] remember we've been made Kings and
[29:35] Priests
[29:37] but here in the Scripture it says the
[29:39] Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
[29:41] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[29:44] the most high God and he blessed him and
[29:46] said Blessed Be Abram of the most high
[29:48] god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he
[29:50] blessed and blessed be the most high God
[29:53] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[29:55] thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
[29:58] we know that David would also mention
[29:59] Melchizedek in Psalms 11 4 he would say
[30:02] the Lord has sworn and will not repent
[30:04] thou art a priest Forever After the
[30:07] order of Melchizedek just for a title
[30:10] tonight by the grace of God I'd like to
[30:12] speak to you a little bit Melchizedek
[30:14] the Forerunner
[30:16] Melchizedek the Forerunner and notice
[30:18] here in the Scriptures it says he was
[30:20] the priest of the most high God but if
[30:24] you if you notice that here in the
[30:25] scripture when you read this here
[30:27] Abraham is and now this one appears unto
[30:30] him uh Melchizedek and he says I am the
[30:33] priest of the most high God this is the
[30:35] first time that priesthood or anything
[30:36] of priests is actually even mentioned in
[30:38] the scripture
[30:40] this is the first time that you would
[30:42] actually even see this word even used
[30:44] that here comes one that says that I am
[30:47] a priest of the the most high God and
[30:49] and if you look into the scriptures uh
[30:52] there there wasn't even anything in the
[30:54] scriptures pertaining to a priesthood
[30:56] the levitical priesthood wasn't even in
[30:58] order here he's appearing uh on onto
[31:01] Abraham and saying I'm the priest of the
[31:03] most high God but you know this is
[31:05] before the levitical law this is before
[31:07] there was ever an order of a priesthood
[31:10] and he's saying I am the priest of the
[31:12] most high God you know what is a priest
[31:14] a priest is somebody who who is
[31:17] authorized or somebody that is qualified
[31:19] to carry out the religious duties of the
[31:22] church he's he's able to carry out the
[31:24] order of the sanctuary and when you look
[31:26] into the the Old Testament you look at
[31:28] the levitical law there would be a high
[31:29] priest and and he was ordained and he
[31:32] was the one that could go in behind the
[31:34] veil and he could he could take the
[31:36] blood of the red heifer and he could
[31:37] sprinkle The Mercy Seat and he would
[31:39] sprinkle it seven times and you know
[31:41] representation that there would be seven
[31:43] Church ages in my you look and look
[31:45] through these things but here this
[31:47] priest of the most high God that
[31:48] appeared on Abraham he appeared before
[31:50] there was any institution of a law he
[31:52] appeared before there was any law given
[31:54] pertaining to a priesthood
[31:57] something to ponder who was this
[31:59] Melchizedek
[32:00] that appeared unto him on the plains of
[32:03] memory but we know that all of these
[32:05] orders that the priest when it was
[32:07] instituted under the levitical law under
[32:09] the aaronic law that everything that
[32:11] they were doing was just all in
[32:13] representation of one that was to come
[32:15] when they would they would make the
[32:17] sacrifice of the red heifer and they
[32:19] would they would take the blood and they
[32:21] would go back into the holiest of holies
[32:23] and there they would sprinkle the mercy
[32:24] see that was only a testimony that there
[32:27] was a sacrifice that was going to come
[32:29] and that high priest that would take
[32:31] that blood and go back there it was just
[32:34] a type and a shadow of foreshadowing
[32:36] that there was coming one that would lay
[32:39] down his own life there was coming one
[32:40] it was a type of our great high priest
[32:43] Jesus Christ who would shed his own
[32:45] blood for our sins and Paul would write
[32:47] this in Hebrews 6 verse 19. he would say
[32:51] which hope we have an anchor of the Soul
[32:53] both sure and steadfast in which inereth
[32:56] into within the veil wither the
[32:58] Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus
[33:01] made in high priest Forever After the
[33:04] order of Melchizedek oh Jesus Christ the
[33:07] Forerunner after the order of
[33:09] Melchizedek has entered in within the
[33:12] veil for you atoning for your sins
[33:15] he was the first one
[33:17] he was the Forerunner he was the one
[33:19] that went in on your behalf is the
[33:22] prophet of God would say in Melchizedek
[33:24] the great Prince and King you would say
[33:26] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[33:29] even Jesus the Forerunner of what
[33:36] the Forerunner of our salvation
[33:39] physically
[33:41] and spiritually
[33:43] for he was wounded for our transgression
[33:45] bruised for our iniquity
[33:48] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[33:50] him
[33:51] and with his stripes we are healed the
[33:54] Forerunner of our Salvation has already
[33:57] entered in
[33:59] the Assurance already entered even Jesus
[34:03] made an high priest Forever After the
[34:06] order of Melchizedek now we're coming to
[34:08] where we want to get this text right
[34:10] quick and get into all these great
[34:12] promises we bottle it down to one thing
[34:16] that Jesus
[34:18] our Forerunner who was the Seed of
[34:21] Abraham through the Holy Spirit has
[34:24] called us to this blessed hope that we
[34:26] now have an anchor of the Soul steadfast
[34:30] and sure anchored within the veil this
[34:33] Jesus being made a forerunner who was in
[34:36] the order of Melchizedek my isn't that
[34:39] wonderful
[34:41] what beautiful words and I just want to
[34:43] maybe uh make this illumination here
[34:46] that in this scripture that we read it
[34:48] says Jesus Christ the Forerunner who has
[34:51] entered into the veil you know this is
[34:53] the only time the word Forerunner is
[34:55] mentioned in Scripture
[34:58] the only time you will read this word
[35:00] and if you even take it to the Greek
[35:01] it's the only time this word Forerunner
[35:04] is even stated in the scripture if you
[35:05] just do a search on it put in Forerunner
[35:07] try to do four Rand one that four run
[35:09] this is the word that speaks of it it's
[35:12] a forerunner and Jesus Christ is the
[35:15] Forerunner who entered in behind the
[35:17] veil and he was a priest made after the
[35:19] order of Melchizedek now I would just
[35:21] like to tell you a little bit about what
[35:23] a forerunner is maybe a definition a
[35:25] forerunner is one who is sent before
[35:28] now this this definition we're given we
[35:31] can see types down through the
[35:32] Scriptures it says a forerunner is one
[35:34] who is sent before to take observation
[35:37] or act as a spy or a scout a light armed
[35:41] Soldier so this this Forerunner is one
[35:43] who goes before
[35:46] you know that makes me think of Joshua
[35:48] and Caleb
[35:49] you know when they had come up to kadish
[35:51] barnia the prophet of God said I want
[35:53] you to go on over into the promised land
[35:55] and you know uh Joshua means Jehovah
[35:58] savior he says I want you to go on over
[36:00] into the promised land and what did
[36:02] Joshua and Caleb do they went on over
[36:04] into the promised land and they went
[36:06] over into the promised land as a scout
[36:08] as one that four ran they were a first
[36:11] one that was entered into that promised
[36:13] land with the children of Israel in the
[36:16] wilderness and they came back packing
[36:17] the goods and saying look it's a good
[36:19] land it's everything that God said it
[36:22] was the fruits of the spirit there
[36:24] there's rejoicing there's Victory
[36:26] there's healing oh it's a land flowing
[36:28] with milk and honey the Holy Ghost is
[36:30] there it's present if you want it come
[36:33] on over but everybody else looked at the
[36:35] well they would have to do they'll say
[36:37] you know what I would have to fight for
[36:39] it I would have to lay down my life for
[36:41] it you know I would have to go to battle
[36:43] I would I would have to die out to my
[36:45] own thinking I'd have to die out to
[36:47] these ways I don't think I want to do
[36:48] that in the people started to murmur
[36:50] they started to complain because the way
[36:52] looked too hard for them they said I
[36:54] know you've come back with the fruits I
[36:56] know you've come back and it testifies
[36:59] exactly what God said it was God said it
[37:01] was a good land God said it was flowing
[37:03] with milk and honey God said I give you
[37:06] this land and here they're presenting
[37:07] the fruits and say it is a good Land
[37:09] look what God Said here is the
[37:11] manifestation of it but the people
[37:13] didn't want to lay down their lives they
[37:15] didn't want to take God at their word
[37:16] they didn't want to fight for it
[37:18] oh my but there was Joshua and Caleb oh
[37:22] oh uh Jehovah savior will say look it's
[37:25] there for us it's there come on over
[37:27] let's go I've made a way for you I've
[37:30] already foreign I've already entered in
[37:33] I've already gone into the promised land
[37:35] if you'll just follow me if you'll just
[37:37] go with me it's a good land it's flowing
[37:40] with milk and honey but are you ready to
[37:42] die are you willing to die are you
[37:44] willing to lay down all of your thoughts
[37:45] are you willing to lay down all your
[37:47] thinking are you willing to get out of
[37:49] the way hey are you willing to let the
[37:50] presence of God move upon your life
[37:53] oh he was a forerunner that had entered
[37:55] in
[37:56] Joshua Jehovah's savior
[38:00] packing the evidence of a good land back
[38:02] showing to them that it was a good land
[38:06] I say Lord let's go I want to fight
[38:10] whatever it takes Lord whatever it takes
[38:12] to enter into a body change whatever it
[38:14] takes to Manifest this message whatever
[38:16] sacrifices I need to make Lord Lord I
[38:18] want to I want to be willing and able
[38:20] and ready Lord Jesus to follow you over
[38:22] I want to possess all things I want to
[38:24] enter into my inheritance are you
[38:26] willing to die out tonight
[38:30] are you willing to lay it all down
[38:33] and cross over into the Promised Land
[38:37] Hallelujah also what this would mean a
[38:40] forerunner it also means one who comes
[38:43] in advance to a place where the rest are
[38:46] to follow
[38:48] well that's enough for shouting grounds
[38:50] right there
[38:51] a forerunner is one who comes in advance
[38:54] to a place where the rest are to follow
[38:57] oh talk about this Forerunner Jesus
[39:00] Christ who for around he is the Waymaker
[39:04] he is the Trailblazer he is the
[39:07] Forerunner when Adam had lost everything
[39:09] and couldn't go back into the presence
[39:11] of God what did Jesus do he said I'm
[39:14] going to come down God said I'll take on
[39:15] sinful flesh and I'll be a forerunner
[39:18] I'll go back into the presence God where
[39:20] man could never come back in Fellowship
[39:23] again I'm going to forerun and I'm going
[39:25] to come back into the presence of God
[39:27] I'm going to manifest the word I'm going
[39:30] to manifest the promises I'm going to be
[39:32] the first one to come into that place of
[39:34] maturity I'm going to be that sheath
[39:36] wave I'm going to be the first fruits of
[39:38] them that slept Oh Glory to God he was a
[39:40] forerunner when he rose there on that
[39:42] third day he was the first fruits of
[39:44] them that's not he was the first one
[39:46] that rose from the dead but after that
[39:48] all those that slept they rose up after
[39:50] him in a great Resurrection he led
[39:52] captivity captain and he ascended on
[39:55] high to the right Throne of God into the
[39:57] presence
[39:58] of the heavenlies oh my what a
[40:00] forerunner
[40:02] Hallelujah Paul would say this in
[40:05] Hebrews chapter four we might do quite a
[40:08] bit of reading of scripture
[40:10] I'm trying to
[40:12] gear down a little bit
[40:14] my transmission might be broke though
[40:23] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14.
[40:26] seeing then that we have a great high
[40:28] priest
[40:30] that is passed into the heavens
[40:33] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[40:36] our profession
[40:37] for we have not a high priest
[40:39] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[40:41] of our infirmities
[40:43] but was all in all points tempted like
[40:46] we are
[40:47] yet without sin
[40:49] let us therefore come boldly under the
[40:52] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[40:55] and find Grace to help
[40:58] in a time of need
[41:00] Melchizedek oh who was this Melchizedek
[41:03] Melchizedek we know that he was the
[41:06] theophany of Jesus Christ it was a word
[41:09] body a prophet of God would say a
[41:11] theophany is something that you cannot
[41:13] see he would say you would point it out
[41:16] you know you think about this one that
[41:17] appeared on the plains of mammary this
[41:20] one that appeared to Abraham the prophet
[41:22] of God said that that was actually the
[41:24] theophany of Jesus Christ that appeared
[41:27] oh my
[41:28] where does that put us at it was the
[41:30] theophany of Jesus Christ that appeared
[41:32] unto Abraham but he said you see a
[41:34] theophany is something that you can't
[41:36] see it's just like TV it's just like
[41:38] radio waves that are going through here
[41:40] but but you see you can't you can't see
[41:42] it you can't pick it up the prophet of
[41:44] God would say this he would say he
[41:46] reveals himself in his great form of
[41:48] what he claimed
[41:49] as he and more face himself into his
[41:52] servants and proves himself now here he
[41:55] is in the form of a spirit
[41:57] and then he comes in the form of amorphy
[41:59] now he appeared to Abraham in morphe
[42:02] when Abraham was returning from the
[42:05] slaughter of Kings here come Melchizedek
[42:07] and talk to him so this theophany of
[42:10] Jesus Christ was formed into an image
[42:14] where Abraham could see him where
[42:16] Abraham could have fellowship with him
[42:18] where Abraham could have communion into
[42:20] this theophany of Jesus Christ formed
[42:23] himself down into a body and he appeared
[42:26] unto Abraham who is this Melchizedek who
[42:30] is this one that appeared down to
[42:32] Abraham on the pla in the place of Mayor
[42:34] who is this one that appeared to Abraham
[42:36] after the slaughter of the Kings and he
[42:38] served him communion
[42:42] and what did he do
[42:44] he blessed them
[42:47] after the slaughter of the Kings there
[42:49] and our text here come melchized at king
[42:52] of Salem which would later become
[42:53] Jerusalem they would say here here come
[42:56] a Melchizedek and he served him Bread
[42:59] and Wine he served him communion and the
[43:02] prophet would say now after the battle
[43:04] was over Melchizedek served as
[43:06] Victorious child communion think of that
[43:10] part of himself
[43:13] now we want to see here in type here in
[43:16] view the communion
[43:18] so think of this now here here here we
[43:22] see one appear unto Abraham who's a high
[43:24] priest after the most high God
[43:26] there's not even a word in the Bible
[43:28] there's not even anything to show
[43:30] Abraham a pattern of it
[43:33] but here's this high priest appearing
[43:35] here's this High preserving communion
[43:37] communions not it's not you look in for
[43:39] Bread and Wine and communion Abraham has
[43:41] nothing there there's nothing communion
[43:43] isn't going to be instituted for another
[43:45] 2 000 years
[43:48] right
[43:49] after the battle he gave himself
[43:53] because he gave of himself
[43:55] because the communion
[43:58] is part of Christ
[44:00] so I just want to read that again in
[44:02] type here and view the communion after
[44:04] the battle he gave of himself because
[44:06] the communion is part of Christ after
[44:09] the struggle is over after you've done
[44:11] got yourself whipped out
[44:14] then is when you partake of Christ
[44:17] become part of this being you get it
[44:20] Jacob wrestled all night and wouldn't
[44:23] turn him loose until he blessed him
[44:26] that's right battled for life
[44:30] battled for life and after the battle is
[44:32] over then God gives you of himself that
[44:37] is his true communion this little bread
[44:40] wafer just represented you shouldn't
[44:42] take it lest you've wrestled it out and
[44:45] become part of God
[44:48] how we could preach on that for a little
[44:50] bit
[44:51] but it's a battle for life
[44:53] where you get so desperate my we've been
[44:56] fellowshipping around the token if you
[44:58] notice brother Brandon preaches there I
[45:00] believe in September he preaches the
[45:02] token but what does he preach in the
[45:03] evening time
[45:04] he preaches desperation because if you
[45:07] want the token you better get desperate
[45:09] it's one thing to walk around and say oh
[45:11] this is the token the token the Holy
[45:13] Ghost the token is the token life the
[45:15] token is the message I believe the
[45:17] message but oh have you ever came down
[45:19] to a battle for life because if you have
[45:21] it you're going to come to a battle for
[45:24] life at some point the devil will come
[45:26] upon you life situations will come upon
[45:28] you something will work upon you in such
[45:30] a way where you come to a place of
[45:32] desperation he said I'm tired of being
[45:34] the way that I am I want to live an
[45:36] overcoming life and you look into the
[45:38] word and you see the promises of the
[45:40] word God gave Abraham a promise and
[45:43] according to that promise he knew he
[45:45] could go to battle and there's a group
[45:46] of people that are gathered together in
[45:48] the house of God that have received a
[45:50] promise and you can go to battle
[45:53] I don't care if you got him to get into
[45:55] desperation I don't care what it takes
[45:57] if you got to get on your knees if you
[45:59] got to come to the altar I'll tell you
[46:01] what I don't want to wait till I'm on a
[46:02] hospital bed
[46:04] I don't want to wait till it's a life or
[46:05] death situation and the blood is eeking
[46:08] out of my body that I finally realized
[46:09] you know what God I think I'll finally
[46:11] get down to a battle for life
[46:15] I say oh God let me get down to business
[46:16] now
[46:18] let me get into desperation now Lord let
[46:20] me make my calling and my election sure
[46:22] tonight Lord I want to battle it out
[46:25] right now Lord I want to have communion
[46:27] with you I want to receive a part of
[46:30] yourself
[46:33] he served Abraham Bread and Wine
[46:37] now just think of these patterns in this
[46:39] order that is being shown here to
[46:42] Abraham when none of these things have
[46:44] even been patterned or shown in the
[46:46] scripture
[46:47] there's no high priest there's no priest
[46:49] there's no religious duties to even
[46:51] carry out there is no communion so
[46:53] here's this one appearing unto Abraham
[46:56] Melchizedek and he's the priest of the
[46:58] most high God and he's serving Bread and
[47:00] Wine and he's servant communion
[47:03] exactly what Jesus would do in Mark 14
[47:06] he would say look he would say this if
[47:09] we'll just look at that Mark 14 verse 22
[47:11] he said and they did eat
[47:13] and Jesus Took bread
[47:16] now think of this
[47:18] 2 000 years prior to this
[47:21] Melchizedek appeared
[47:23] unto Abraham
[47:25] and served him communion
[47:28] now two thousand years later we see this
[47:31] communion being instituted
[47:36] and as they did eat Jesus Took bread and
[47:39] blessed it
[47:40] and break it
[47:41] and gave them and said take eat
[47:44] this is my body
[47:47] and he took the cup and when he had
[47:49] given thanks he gave it to them and they
[47:51] drank of it and he said unto them this
[47:52] is my blood of the new testament which
[47:55] is shed
[47:57] for many
[48:00] no it's not a it's it's it's it's a type
[48:05] when Jesus stood there and said unless
[48:06] you eat my flesh and drink my blood you
[48:08] have no life oh my they they stumbled at
[48:10] it because they couldn't understand it
[48:12] when he says I'll have communion with
[48:14] you I will give you my flesh to eat now
[48:16] my blood is my flesh is meat and do it
[48:19] was so hard to understand what he was
[48:21] talking about but what he was showing he
[48:23] was showing a type of how he was going
[48:25] to have communion and give up self
[48:27] because the word was made flesh it's the
[48:30] word that you're feeding on that's our
[48:32] communion is the word of God that we
[48:34] have received that is the communion of
[48:37] the believer in the end time that we
[48:39] have received the body word of the son
[48:41] of man and that is what we are feeding
[48:43] on the prophet of God would say this he
[48:46] would say and this same Melchizedek said
[48:48] and the next verse would read like this
[48:51] in Mark 14 verse 25 but I'm catching
[48:53] this quote because the prophet of God is
[48:55] saying and this same Melchizedek said I
[48:58] will take no more of the fruit of the
[48:59] vine until I drink it Anew with you in
[49:01] my father's Kingdom after the battle's
[49:04] over when the victory is won so here the
[49:07] prophet of God has pointed out this is
[49:08] Melchizedek
[49:12] this is Melchizedek and notice the type
[49:15] here he says after the battle is over
[49:19] this is a great type where Melchizedek
[49:22] has appeared unto Abraham
[49:24] and he's serving him communion he's
[49:27] serving them Bread and Wine and what is
[49:29] it it's after the battle the prophet of
[49:31] God shows us and in the scripture as
[49:34] Jesus would would say there in verse 25
[49:36] he said I drink I will drink no more of
[49:39] the fruit of Vine until that day that I
[49:41] drink in Anew with you in the kingdom
[49:42] when it's all over
[49:46] when it's all over we're going to meet
[49:48] him in the air
[49:51] oh we're going to be gathered at that
[49:54] wedding supper
[49:57] and that one we've longed to see
[49:59] that one we've we've heard about
[50:03] that one we've been looking
[50:05] for the one we've long to see oh that
[50:09] day will come
[50:11] where we sit down at that great supper
[50:13] table stretched for miles and we see all
[50:16] of our loved ones and the ones that have
[50:17] crossed the port or we see ones in our
[50:20] family that we didn't know if God's
[50:22] mercy would would breach that strand oh
[50:25] he's a god of Mercy he's a god of
[50:27] compassion and on that day oh we'll see
[50:30] all of our brothers and sisters and the
[50:32] ones that have gone before and there
[50:34] we'll have communion at the wedding
[50:36] supper with our Lord what a day
[50:38] what a glorious day that will be when
[50:41] the battle is over and we come to that
[50:43] place but I just want to labor here for
[50:46] a little bit on Melchizedek if we'll
[50:47] turn in our Bibles to Hebrews chapter 7.
[51:00] as Paul would pick this up now referring
[51:03] to our text in Genesis 14 and as
[51:07] Melchizedek would appear again later
[51:09] unto Abraham in the scriptures Hebrews 7
[51:12] 1 would say for this Melchizedek king of
[51:15] Salem
[51:16] priest of the most high God who met
[51:18] Abraham returning from the slaughter of
[51:20] the Kings and blessed him to whom also
[51:23] Abraham gave a tenth part of all
[51:26] first be an interpretation king of
[51:28] righteousness and after that also king
[51:31] of Salem which is king of peace
[51:34] without father
[51:36] without mother without dissent having
[51:40] neither beginning of days nor ending of
[51:42] life but made like unto the Son of God
[51:44] abideth a priest continually now
[51:46] consider
[51:48] how great this man was
[51:50] unto whom even even the patriarch
[51:53] Abraham gave the teeth of the spoils
[51:56] consider
[51:58] how great a man this was the prophet of
[52:02] God would read that and then he would
[52:03] say that's the question
[52:05] who is this Melchizedek
[52:07] consider how great a man this was
[52:12] men have proved that who is this
[52:14] Melchizedek down Through the Ages and
[52:16] and they've they've debated and they've
[52:18] said well it was just a priesthood it
[52:21] was just more of an office it wasn't a
[52:22] real person and other people would say
[52:25] oh it's just a myth
[52:27] some people say it was just mythology it
[52:30] wasn't even there but oh watch what the
[52:32] prophet of God would say and who is this
[52:33] Melchizedek now notice praise God
[52:37] for these opening seals is my prayer to
[52:40] know these things now he's preaching
[52:42] this in 1965 February 21st in the
[52:45] evening time now he says now paragraph
[52:48] 95 now the true revelation of
[52:51] Melchizedek comes into view
[52:55] so at the opening of The Seven Seals the
[52:58] revelation of Melchizedek comes into
[53:00] view what he was God the word before he
[53:04] became flesh God the word because he had
[53:07] to be no one else could be immortal like
[53:09] him see I had father and mother you did
[53:12] two Jesus had father and mother but this
[53:15] man had no father but this man had no
[53:17] mother Jesus had a time he started this
[53:21] man didn't
[53:22] well let's see we were talking about
[53:23] desperation some of us need a revelation
[53:26] of the godhead
[53:27] and I pray God give me more Revelation
[53:29] with the godhead if we ever come to the
[53:31] place we think we figured out God
[53:33] something wrong
[53:34] and I think that's what some of our
[53:36] problems and I'll raise my hand included
[53:38] some of our problems we think we got God
[53:40] we think we got the message we think we
[53:41] got Melchizedek we think we got the son
[53:43] of man we think we just got it the
[53:44] coming of the lord we got it all figured
[53:46] out we ain't got to get it do anything I
[53:48] think it's time to have a battle of life
[53:49] I think it's time to get in desperation
[53:51] I think it's time to pray for Revelation
[53:53] I think it's time to get serious about
[53:54] what we believe and say oh God why don't
[53:56] you reveal these things to me if the
[53:58] revelation of Melchizedek came in the
[53:59] plain view at the revelation of the
[54:01] seals Lord give me that revelation
[54:05] I'll try to gear back down for the
[54:07] interpreters
[54:10] now the true revelation of Melchizedek
[54:13] comes into view
[54:15] what he was God the word
[54:18] before he became flesh
[54:21] God the word because he had to be
[54:24] no one else could be immortal like him
[54:27] see I had father and mother you did too
[54:30] Jesus had father and mother but this man
[54:34] had no father or no mother Jesus had a
[54:37] time he started this man didn't
[54:39] Jesus gave his life this man couldn't
[54:42] Jesus because he was life
[54:45] and it's the self same man all the time
[54:51] I hope God reveals it to you
[54:54] the self same person
[54:56] all the time notice his titles king of
[55:01] righteousness
[55:02] now Hebrews 7 2 King of righteousness
[55:05] and king of peace
[55:07] he is two kings now watch Hebrews 1 7 2
[55:11] King of righteousness also the king of
[55:14] peace
[55:15] he is two kings there now since he has
[55:18] come in the flesh and received his body
[55:20] up in Revelations 21 16 he called the
[55:24] king of kings
[55:26] he's all three of them together see King
[55:29] God King theophany King Jesus he is the
[55:34] king of kings
[55:36] it's all men just like soul body and
[55:40] spirit all comes to make one oh that
[55:43] makes me think of Hebrews 4 12. the word
[55:46] is sharper than any two-edged sword oh
[55:49] why because he's all of them his body's
[55:51] Soul and Spirit he knows all about it
[55:54] and it's just like soul body and spirit
[55:56] all comes to make one also he is which
[55:59] was the first son in the Holy Ghost of
[56:01] the spirit king of righteousness the
[56:03] spirit attribute theophany
[56:05] King peace theophany and In the Flesh he
[56:10] was King of Kings same person
[56:15] now the true revelation of Melchizedek
[56:18] comes into view
[56:20] what do you say I hope God reveals it to
[56:22] you
[56:23] what did he say this Revelation came at
[56:25] the opening of The Seven Seals
[56:29] now I just maybe want to be admonished
[56:32] by Brother Paul for a little bit
[56:34] if you can receive anything I believe we
[56:36] can receive it from Brother Paul
[56:38] let's turn in our Bibles to Hebrews 5
[56:41] verse 9.
[56:51] Paul would write and be and made perfect
[56:55] he became the author of Eternal
[56:57] salvation unto all them that obey him
[57:00] called of God and the high priest after
[57:02] the order of Melchizedek of whom we have
[57:05] many things to say
[57:07] and hard to be uttered seeing ye are
[57:10] Duel of hearing
[57:12] well Dole means slow or sluggish and I
[57:15] thought you know Lord forgive me
[57:18] open my understanding that I might pray
[57:21] for revelation
[57:24] because many times we hear phrases and
[57:27] we hear things in the word and we got a
[57:28] little tally book and we just put a
[57:30] little check mark But Here Paul is
[57:32] saying look there's many things that I
[57:34] want to say about Melchizedek but you're
[57:37] slow to understanding and to think the
[57:39] prophet would pick that up and say look
[57:40] the revelation of Melchizedek could only
[57:42] come after the revelation of the Seven
[57:45] Seals to think that we're now sitting in
[57:47] the seat to where these very things that
[57:49] people have probed at and they're here
[57:52] Paul is saying look I have many things
[57:54] to say about Melchizedek but you your
[57:57] Dole of here and you you won't be able
[57:58] to receive that now uh because this is
[58:01] strong meat
[58:04] he would go on to say
[58:09] for when the time would you ought to be
[58:11] teachers
[58:14] ye have need that one teach you again
[58:16] with which be the first principles of
[58:19] the Oracles of God and are become such
[58:21] as need of milk and not a strong meat
[58:25] you know this really just
[58:27] you know
[58:29] pierced my heart when I was reading it
[58:31] and I was studying over it and I just
[58:33] thought oh God forgive me a time that we
[58:36] should be teachers out of all people who
[58:38] have sat under the message and we sit
[58:40] under a pastor who's preached it in
[58:42] almost 50 years and and we got the table
[58:44] and we we have all of the message at our
[58:47] disposal and if anybody should be able
[58:49] to be teachers
[58:52] if anybody should be able to be teachers
[58:54] of this message is those that have come
[58:58] out and been gathered under the voice of
[59:00] the seventh angel messenger where the
[59:02] book has come open and it's become a new
[59:04] book and the revelation of Melchizedek
[59:06] has now been made plain to the Believers
[59:09] and he Paul is admonishing us and say
[59:11] look
[59:12] you should be teachers
[59:15] but you have need that one teach you
[59:17] again
[59:18] I say Lord forgive me
[59:21] father may I get down to the Battle of
[59:23] life may I start crying out earnestly
[59:25] for more Revelation that God might
[59:27] reveal himself to me
[59:29] because you need one preach uh teach the
[59:32] first principles of the Oracles of God
[59:34] and are become such as of need of milk
[59:37] and not of strong meat
[59:39] for everyone that useth milk is
[59:41] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[59:43] for he is a babe but strong meat
[59:47] belongeth to them that are of full age
[59:50] even those
[59:52] who by reason of use have their senses
[59:55] exercised to discern both Good and Evil
[1:00:07] you hear a word like that from Paul
[1:00:11] a time that you should be teachers
[1:00:15] but you needeth one to teach you
[1:00:20] that's a that's a solemn warning to me
[1:00:24] I think that's a solemn warning to the
[1:00:25] church say you know what when we come
[1:00:28] across these subjects and we come across
[1:00:30] these things laying in the word you know
[1:00:32] I I I want strong meat I praise God for
[1:00:35] milk I praise God uh for the milk for
[1:00:38] babes because we all need those things
[1:00:40] and that that's what Paul would go on
[1:00:42] when he would come into chapter six he
[1:00:45] would say let us go on to Perfection he
[1:00:47] say therefore leaving the principles of
[1:00:49] the doctrine of Christ let us go on
[1:00:51] under Perfection not laying again the
[1:00:52] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:00:54] and Faith towards God
[1:00:56] oh but let us let this mind be in you
[1:00:59] which was also in Christ Jesus I say oh
[1:01:01] God that's what I want Lord I want to
[1:01:04] have that mind I want to have that word
[1:01:06] I I want to be a student of the word if
[1:01:09] if that means if I can be unskillful if
[1:01:13] I'm just requiring milk and I'm
[1:01:14] requiring a teacher and I need somebody
[1:01:16] to walk me through it every time you
[1:01:18] know what that's a sign of it's a sign
[1:01:19] of lack of Revelation
[1:01:22] because when something is revealed to
[1:01:24] you it becomes a part of you you can
[1:01:26] work the problem backwards and forwards
[1:01:28] it's not just a memory card it's not
[1:01:31] just uh something that you've memorized
[1:01:33] like I told many times about my daughter
[1:01:36] one time I was I was reading her a book
[1:01:39] you know and and and and and and she she
[1:01:42] started reading the book and I thought
[1:01:44] my goodness
[1:01:45] my daughter's the youngest reader ever
[1:01:49] she she can actually read
[1:01:51] and I was like this is incredible you
[1:01:54] know I can't believe I I can't remember
[1:01:55] how old she was maybe four years old and
[1:01:57] and as she's reading the book and I'm
[1:02:00] like man all right praise the Lord now
[1:02:02] I'm I'm gonna get another book
[1:02:04] and I'm going to going to prove that she
[1:02:07] can read
[1:02:08] but what I found out is all she had done
[1:02:11] was memorize what she was seeing
[1:02:15] all she had was the ability to rehearse
[1:02:19] what she had been told so when the
[1:02:22] question would be asked who is this
[1:02:24] Melchizedek because he had been told to
[1:02:27] her she could rehearse what she had been
[1:02:31] told but not have an understanding of
[1:02:34] what she was saying
[1:02:38] oh God I don't want religion
[1:02:42] I don't want to just be able to to to to
[1:02:46] to to know the answers intellectually
[1:02:50] that won't do it Church
[1:02:53] just because you can listen to a message
[1:02:56] and do a book report on it doesn't do
[1:02:58] you any good there's many people that
[1:03:01] I've done a lot of book reports and
[1:03:03] preached a lot of sermons but when it
[1:03:05] came down to the Battle of Life they
[1:03:07] walked away from this message because
[1:03:09] they never received a part of God into
[1:03:11] themselves they never actually had
[1:03:13] communion they never actually met him on
[1:03:16] the planes of mammary and recognized who
[1:03:19] it really was that Melchizedek came to
[1:03:21] serve you Bread and Wine and to give you
[1:03:24] a part of himself that you could feed on
[1:03:26] that word and not just feed on that word
[1:03:29] that you could become a part of that
[1:03:30] word
[1:03:32] then when it's a revelation
[1:03:35] Let The Trials come let the questions
[1:03:38] come let the Devils line up Let the Sea
[1:03:41] Billows roll and they come to question
[1:03:43] you is this message real was brother
[1:03:46] Branham a real Prophet or a false
[1:03:47] prophet and they line up all their guns
[1:03:50] they line up all their ammunition and
[1:03:52] you say look if you want to take amen my
[1:03:54] Prophet you take aim at me if you want
[1:03:56] to take aim at the message of the hour
[1:03:58] you take aim at me if you take out the
[1:04:00] aim at me you take aim at my Lord why
[1:04:03] because it's all one flesh this is the
[1:04:05] body of Jesus Christ this is the word of
[1:04:08] God made flesh in the evening time
[1:04:11] Glory Hallelujah praise His wonderful
[1:04:14] name we are having communion with him
[1:04:21] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:04:23] in Christ Jesus
[1:04:27] so back to
[1:04:28] Hebrews 7
[1:04:30] . consider how great a man this was
[1:04:38] I think it's worth thinking about
[1:04:41] obviously worth preaching about
[1:04:44] foreign
[1:04:45] not myself the prophet
[1:04:50] because the prophet preached it we have
[1:04:51] something to preach
[1:04:53] glory to God without this message we
[1:04:55] ain't got nothing to say
[1:04:58] I'm sorry about it
[1:04:59] I ain't got nothing to say without
[1:05:01] Malachi 4 5.
[1:05:03] I might as well just be a good Baptist
[1:05:05] might as well just be a good Methodist
[1:05:07] might as well be a good Pentecostal with
[1:05:08] no life in it just a bunch of rituals
[1:05:10] rules and regulations trying to come up
[1:05:12] with some sermon to tickle the ears of
[1:05:15] the people with itchy ears but oh God
[1:05:17] has descended in the evening time and
[1:05:19] opened the book and he's opened our
[1:05:21] understanding and he's put his words
[1:05:23] into a heart that we might have
[1:05:25] something to Fellowship around that we
[1:05:27] might have true communion
[1:05:29] oh thank you God for this message I'm
[1:05:32] glad we got something to talk about
[1:05:35] you can talk about something that's
[1:05:37] behind a form
[1:05:38] you can guess all day long you could
[1:05:41] throw a sheet over this and you can
[1:05:42] everybody you can talk about all you
[1:05:44] want and you can come up with all your
[1:05:46] ideas of what you think it is well if
[1:05:48] you see that angle coming up like that
[1:05:50] well I tell you what that that angle
[1:05:52] coming up like that I'm telling you it
[1:05:53] must be a Steinway they're the only ones
[1:05:55] that make it this way you throw a
[1:05:57] blanket on that one that must be a I
[1:05:58] tell you you see it sticking up on back
[1:05:59] that might be a 57 Chevy and everybody's
[1:06:02] just going to probe what is under the
[1:06:04] veil what is under there well I tell you
[1:06:07] what I think it is I think that's a
[1:06:08] sculpture from Michelangelo but what
[1:06:11] everybody's just presuming everybody's
[1:06:13] just uh wondering what it is but then
[1:06:15] God by Divine promise he came in the
[1:06:18] evening time Melchizedek has come again
[1:06:20] to serve you Bread and Wine and to have
[1:06:23] communion with the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:06:25] and he reached over and he grabbed the
[1:06:27] veil and said you want to know what's
[1:06:29] behind it and he took the valley away
[1:06:30] and said that's what it's been all the
[1:06:32] time this is me it's the same life I am
[1:06:35] Melchizedek I am the one that appeared
[1:06:37] on the planes of marriage Abraham I am
[1:06:40] the one that formed myself a body and I
[1:06:42] became your high priest after the order
[1:06:44] of Melchizedek I am the one that came in
[1:06:48] the evening time to break the Seven
[1:06:50] Seals
[1:06:52] Glory
[1:06:54] Hallelujah I'm happy about it
[1:06:59] verse 11.
[1:07:01] Hebrews 7 11.
[1:07:03] if therefore perfection
[1:07:06] now we're gonna really
[1:07:08] jump into what is this order of
[1:07:10] Melchizedek
[1:07:12] foreign
[1:07:14] Perfection were by the levitical
[1:07:16] priesthood
[1:07:19] for under it the people received the law
[1:07:22] what further need was there
[1:07:25] that another priest should arise
[1:07:28] after the order
[1:07:30] of Melchizedek what was this hoarder
[1:07:33] what are you talking about brother Paul
[1:07:35] and not be called after the order of
[1:07:38] Aaron
[1:07:40] for the priesthood being changed
[1:07:43] change from the priesthood of Aaron
[1:07:45] changed from the levitical priesthood
[1:07:48] changed to
[1:07:50] the order of Melchizedek changed to our
[1:07:52] high priest Jesus Christ for the
[1:07:54] priesthood being changed they're made of
[1:07:57] necessity a change also of the law so so
[1:08:00] what Paul is saying here
[1:08:02] remember what a priest is it's somebody
[1:08:04] who's authorized
[1:08:07] to carry out the religious duties
[1:08:09] now the only ones that were authorized
[1:08:12] to carry out the Priestly duties was if
[1:08:14] you were born a levite
[1:08:17] so so Moses had given the law the tribe
[1:08:20] of levite was chosen to be the levitical
[1:08:23] priesthood and the law was given and
[1:08:26] because of the law there was an order
[1:08:28] for those priests to serve under
[1:08:32] right so then they the the priesthood
[1:08:34] was after the order of Aaron but you see
[1:08:38] this priesthood that was instituted
[1:08:40] these priests were men like me and you
[1:08:44] sinful men who also had to make a
[1:08:48] sacrifice for themselves
[1:08:50] they not only had to to make a sacrifice
[1:08:53] for the people but they had to make a
[1:08:55] sacrifice for themselves and then that
[1:08:57] high priest could make a sacrifice for
[1:08:59] the people and for himself and then he
[1:09:02] could go back behind the veil and they
[1:09:03] did all of that according to the law
[1:09:06] that's what gave them Authority that's
[1:09:08] what gave them the place that's what
[1:09:10] gave them the order but what Paul is
[1:09:12] saying if now Jesus Christ has become
[1:09:15] our high priest if these priests were
[1:09:18] after the order of Aaron by the law by
[1:09:21] the latter then if Jesus Christ is our
[1:09:23] high priest he has come then there has
[1:09:25] to be a word concerning that priesthood
[1:09:29] we are not under the law of sin and
[1:09:32] death
[1:09:34] oh Hallelujah
[1:09:37] he would go on to say for he of whom
[1:09:39] these things
[1:09:41] are spoken pertaineth now now we take
[1:09:44] our time here just try to read it it
[1:09:46] says for he of whom these things are
[1:09:48] spoken pertaineth to another tribe
[1:09:53] so remember the tribe was Levi that was
[1:09:55] chosen to carry out the levitical
[1:09:56] priesthood right
[1:09:58] but now Paul is pointing out uh speaking
[1:10:00] of this order of Melchizedek
[1:10:03] speaking about this
[1:10:05] priesthood that has come in by Jesus
[1:10:08] Christ he's saying for of he of whom
[1:10:10] these things are spoken pertaineth to
[1:10:12] another tribe of which no man gave
[1:10:15] attendance at the altar
[1:10:18] only the try believe I did that where
[1:10:20] this man came from it's not even
[1:10:21] mentioned
[1:10:22] for it is evident that our Lord's
[1:10:25] praying out of Judah
[1:10:27] of which the tribe Moses spake nothing
[1:10:29] concerning the priesthood
[1:10:31] and it is yet far more evident
[1:10:34] for that after the similitude of
[1:10:36] Melchizedek there arises another priest
[1:10:40] who is made not after the law of a
[1:10:44] carnal commandment
[1:10:45] you see
[1:10:47] the levitical priesthood
[1:10:49] was made after a law of a carnal
[1:10:52] commandment
[1:10:53] but this Melchizedek
[1:10:56] your high priest
[1:10:58] Jesus Christ was not made after the law
[1:11:01] of a carnal commandment but he was made
[1:11:04] after the power of an endless life
[1:11:08] for he testify it thou art a priest
[1:11:11] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[1:11:15] oh my Melchizedek the high priest
[1:11:23] for he testified thou art a priest
[1:11:25] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[1:11:27] not after the law of sin and death
[1:11:30] but this is a new high priest this is a
[1:11:33] new order this is not under the old
[1:11:35] carnal commandment under men where where
[1:11:37] you pay tithes to a man and that man
[1:11:40] dies
[1:11:41] that's what Paul is saying in the book
[1:11:42] of Hebrews look there there was a
[1:11:44] priesthood here and you would pay tithes
[1:11:46] to the priest and that priest would die
[1:11:48] and there would because because death
[1:11:50] would continue and there would be a high
[1:11:51] priest and there would be priests and
[1:11:53] there'd be priests after Levi but this
[1:11:55] one that that Abraham paid tithes to
[1:11:58] this one that appeared unto Abraham the
[1:12:00] one Abraham paid ties to this one didn't
[1:12:03] have a beginning this one didn't have an
[1:12:05] end and this one will never die that is
[1:12:08] the order of Melchizedek your high
[1:12:10] priest Jesus Christ he didn't have a
[1:12:12] beginning he didn't have an end oh don't
[1:12:14] get your godhead mixed up now who was it
[1:12:17] that formed that body God was able to
[1:12:20] take his own word and form it into the
[1:12:22] womb of a virgin and bring forth a Word
[1:12:26] Flesh and he would come and live in that
[1:12:28] body
[1:12:30] to fulfill his own law
[1:12:33] oh
[1:12:34] what a high priest
[1:12:39] oh they had need to sacrifice from
[1:12:41] themselves but look that law was to be
[1:12:43] done away with
[1:12:44] but now this high priest was Jesus
[1:12:47] Christ with it now we're taking an
[1:12:49] exodus out of law
[1:12:51] and into Grace
[1:12:53] we're taking an exodus out into the law
[1:12:55] under a carnal commandment to the power
[1:12:57] of an endless life remember you've been
[1:12:59] made Kings and Priests
[1:13:01] so then under the law everybody was
[1:13:03] subject under the law of sin and death
[1:13:05] but now we are under the power of an
[1:13:08] endless life we have been made Kings and
[1:13:10] Priests after the order of Melchizedek
[1:13:12] Jesus Christ our high priest
[1:13:17] glory to God
[1:13:19] what are we talking about
[1:13:22] a power of an endless life
[1:13:25] what could defeat him
[1:13:27] this high priest
[1:13:29] the devil could have went back and said
[1:13:31] I took every single high preached out
[1:13:34] but this high priest was made after the
[1:13:36] power of an endless life there was no
[1:13:39] Jacob No Grave no hell no sickness
[1:13:43] this high priest had power to lay his
[1:13:45] life down and take it up again that's
[1:13:47] the order of Melchizedek one who had no
[1:13:50] beginning of days one who had no ending
[1:13:52] of life that is our high priest Jesus
[1:13:54] Christ oh the Forerunner has entered in
[1:13:57] on your behalf

[1:14:03] as Jesus would stand there
[1:14:07] maybe then priests would be looking at
[1:14:10] him
[1:14:11] and Jesus would stand there and say
[1:14:13] before Abraham was
[1:14:15] I am
[1:14:18] they wanted to Stone him for it
[1:14:23] I am
[1:14:25] the one
[1:14:26] who served communion
[1:14:29] Abraham
[1:14:31] I am the one that came to Abraham
[1:14:35] after the slaughter of the Kings
[1:14:37] and I served them Bread and Wine
[1:14:40] I am
[1:14:42] oh they wanted to Stone them
[1:14:45] I am the one that appeared unto Moses
[1:14:48] in a burning bush
[1:14:50] I am the one that parted the Red Sea
[1:14:54] I am the rock that was in the wilderness
[1:14:57] that was smitten I am the pride that's

[1:15:33] and would call her today a red light
[1:15:34] woman a prostitute she had too many
[1:15:36] husbands

[1:18:47] now remember this Melchizedek
[1:18:52] his words
[1:18:53] that was the prophet's words
[1:18:55] now remember this Melchizedek
[1:18:57] this Jesus
[1:19:00] this Jesus yesterday the son of man
[1:19:04] and she looked around and she saw a Jew
[1:19:09] so she said sir
[1:19:11] is not profit proper for Jew to ask a
[1:19:14] Samaritan for anything
[1:19:15] I'm a woman of Samaria
[1:19:18] so you have spoken out of your place
[1:19:20] you shouldn't have asked me such a thing
[1:19:22] as that
[1:19:24] we have no dealings with another he said
[1:19:26] but if you knew
[1:19:30] but if you knew who you was talking to
[1:19:34] you had asked me for a drink
[1:19:37] I would ask you what do you see when you
[1:19:39] look
[1:19:40] she saw a Jew
[1:19:43] when she looked she saw a Jew there what
[1:19:46] do you see when you look at the message
[1:19:47] what do you see when you look at the
[1:19:50] prophet what do you look when you see a
[1:19:52] cloud up there what do you see when you
[1:19:55] look she when she looks she saw a Jew
[1:19:57] but just a few more moments in the
[1:20:00] presence of the son of man in the
[1:20:03] presence of Melchizedek as he started to
[1:20:05] discern the thoughts and intents of her
[1:20:07] heart all of a sudden it sounded like
[1:20:10] home to her she said when Messiah comes
[1:20:12] he will tell us these things and all of
[1:20:15] a sudden the veil that was over her eyes
[1:20:17] God pulled it away and she said this is
[1:20:21] him this is him this is the Messiah and
[1:20:25] now she ran back and said come see a man
[1:20:27] come and see
[1:20:31] oh Hallelujah
[1:20:33] glory to God
[1:20:39] what did what did uh Nathaniel say when
[1:20:42] he came into his presence

[1:20:57] when you're out there doing drugs
[1:21:01] when you're all mixed up in the world
[1:21:03] when you ran off out there without a boy
[1:21:05] over there
[1:21:07] when you got yourself and all that
[1:21:09] family problems when you were born into
[1:21:12] a situation you thought there was no way
[1:21:14] out that's when I saw you while you were

[1:21:36] that tree I knew when you were going
[1:21:39] through all those problems I knew all
[1:21:40] those things the the that the reason why
[1:21:42] I knew them so I could bear them to
[1:21:45] Calvary

[1:22:09] I am Melchizedek
[1:22:12] Hallelujah
[1:22:13] oh black I just why don't the musicians
[1:22:15] just come I don't want to belabor while
[1:22:18] the presence of God is Rich amongst us
[1:22:25] that's what Paul is saying in Hebrews 7
[1:22:27] he's saying if the law could have
[1:22:29] produced perfection
[1:22:31] a new order wouldn't have been needed
[1:22:34] he said in Hebrews 8 7 he says for if
[1:22:36] the first Covenant have been faultless
[1:22:40] then should no place have been sought
[1:22:42] for a second
[1:22:43] for finding fault with them he saith
[1:22:45] behold the days come saith the Lord when
[1:22:47] I will make a New Covenant with the
[1:22:49] house of Israel and with the house of
[1:22:51] Judah just give me a moment just a few
[1:22:53] moments before we play brother Cosman
[1:22:57] listen to The Prophet say these words
[1:23:01] by God's grace and his help will
[1:23:04] we'll try to capitalize on where we're
[1:23:06] sitting
[1:23:08] Christ revealed in his own word like in
[1:23:11] Hebrews there when Paul wrote it
[1:23:13] he is God
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ yesterday of the Old
[1:23:18] Testament he is Jesus Christ today
[1:23:21] manifested in the flesh
[1:23:24] and he's Jesus Christ forever in the
[1:23:26] spirit to come
[1:23:27] see saying yesterday today and forever
[1:23:30] and he ever lives to make his word live
[1:23:32] what it said it would do for that age
[1:23:36] he is alive
[1:23:38] he was alive in the Old Testament
[1:23:40] manifested
[1:23:42] I just want to let you see a little
[1:23:43] something here if you can stand it watch
[1:23:46] when Jesus was manifested in the Old
[1:23:48] Testament as we believe it
[1:23:50] now you preachers out there you can
[1:23:52] argue with it do whatever you want
[1:23:55] do what you think
[1:23:56] see when Jesus was manifested in the Old
[1:23:59] Testament in a theophany
[1:24:02] and the person of Melchizedek not a
[1:24:04] priesthood
[1:24:06] but the person the man see for this man
[1:24:09] had not yet been born but he was in a
[1:24:11] theophany
[1:24:12] so he had no father no mother
[1:24:15] he was God himself
[1:24:18] he was manifested
[1:24:20] in the form of a man
[1:24:23] called King of Salem which is king of
[1:24:26] peace and King righteousness see he was
[1:24:28] Melchizedek
[1:24:30] he had neither father nor mother
[1:24:31] beginning of days or ending of Life see
[1:24:33] it was Jesus in a theophany in the form
[1:24:36] of a man could you go that
[1:24:38] all right then he was made actually
[1:24:40] human flesh and dwelt Among Us in the
[1:24:43] person of Jesus Christ born the Virgin
[1:24:46] Mary he come in the form so he could die
[1:24:49] and went back into heaven
[1:24:51] but now in the last days
[1:24:54] he's promised to manifest himself in the
[1:24:57] fullness again of his flesh conspiracy
[1:25:00] for it was as it was in the days of
[1:25:03] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:25:06] the son of man
[1:25:08] oh
[1:25:09] don't you realize the same one
[1:25:12] that appeared unto Abraham
[1:25:14] after the order of Melchizedek because
[1:25:17] this was a spiritual priesthood this was
[1:25:19] for the Royal Seed of Abraham this same
[1:25:22] Melchizedek has now by Divine promise
[1:25:25] has come in the end time and he took on
[1:25:28] flesh again that he might serve you
[1:25:30] communion that he might serve you
[1:25:32] Brandon what who is this Melchizedek I
[1:25:35] want you to consider how great a man
[1:25:38] this was not the man William Branham the
[1:25:41] life of God that came and borrowed that
[1:25:44] vessel he said I was just once standing
[1:25:47] near
[1:25:48] he said man's words will fail
[1:25:52] man my words will fail I just was one
[1:25:56] that could surrender myself that he
[1:25:58] could take my voice and use my voice and
[1:26:01] speak out to the bride you're not
[1:26:03] feeding on the words of a man his words
[1:26:05] will fail you're feeding on the body
[1:26:07] word of the son of man you are having
[1:26:10] communion with Melchizedek you are
[1:26:13] having communion with the Lord the great
[1:26:16] Forerunner Melchizedek has come and made
[1:26:18] a way for you in the evening time bless
[1:26:21] his wonderful name
[1:26:23] why don't we just stand
[1:26:26] just start to play something softly
[1:26:28] brother maybe the Revelation song I was
[1:26:30] enjoying that
[1:26:34] Peter says this
[1:26:41] wherefore laying aside first Peter 2 1.
[1:26:43] we'll first laying aside on malice and
[1:26:46] Argyle
[1:26:47] and hypocrisies
[1:26:49] and envies
[1:26:51] in all evil speakings
[1:26:53] as newborn babes desire the sincere milk
[1:26:56] of the word
[1:26:58] he doesn't leave it there
[1:27:00] that you might grow thereby
[1:27:04] if so be that you have tasted
[1:27:07] that the Lord is gracious
[1:27:10] to whom coming
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] as unto a Lively Stone
[1:27:16] disallowed indeed of men
[1:27:19] but chosen of God
[1:27:21] and precious
[1:27:24] oh he was the Capstone he was the
[1:27:25] headstone
[1:27:27] that was rejected
[1:27:29] Romans 9 33 said blessed is he who is
[1:27:33] not ashamed
[1:27:34] in me
[1:27:36] says for he was not ashamed in me what
[1:27:39] was it
[1:27:40] I'm not ashamed in this message
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:43] I'm not ashamed of how God revealed
[1:27:45] himself in the end time
[1:27:48] I'm not ashamed
[1:27:51] of this message I'm not ashamed of the
[1:27:55] Gospel as it is written behold I lay
[1:27:56] inside on a stumbling Stone
[1:27:58] and a rock of offense and whosoever
[1:28:00] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:28:05] foreign
[1:28:07] many people have been ashamed
[1:28:12] when it came down to a battle for life
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:15] they tried to do all the math they tried
[1:28:17] to do all the homework they finally came
[1:28:18] to the conclusion
[1:28:20] that this message wasn't for them
[1:28:24] I don't care how much math I tried to do
[1:28:27] and how many surgeries I try to have I
[1:28:30] cannot change being a McGarry
[1:28:33] I was born in McGeary
[1:28:35] nothing I can do can change that
[1:28:38] and you were born a son and daughter of
[1:28:41] God
[1:28:42] because God chose you your situation
[1:28:45] doesn't Define you your troubles don't
[1:28:47] Define you but God knew all of your
[1:28:50] trouble he knew all of your heartache so
[1:28:52] he said look I'll be the one
[1:28:54] I'll be the one to enter in behind the
[1:28:56] veil I'll be Melchizedek I'll be the
[1:28:59] Forerunner I'll for run on your behalf
[1:29:02] I'll come to the place of maturity first
[1:29:04] because if I come to that place first as
[1:29:07] a forerunner then that means all of you
[1:29:10] can follow after him
[1:29:12] what is a sheath wave
[1:29:14] it's a first one that come to maturity
[1:29:17] then oh

[1:29:28] Melchizedek
[1:29:30] he would say now father God
[1:29:33] this is totally out of the hands of man
[1:29:41] there was one in our generation that
[1:29:43] fulfilled
[1:29:45] laughs
[1:29:47] when Jesus prayed and said
[1:29:49] father I pray that they would be one
[1:29:54] even as We Are One
[1:29:56] [Music]
[1:30:00] there came a man who stood on the earth
[1:30:02] in the end time
[1:30:04] who came into that Oneness
[1:30:07] and that Unity
[1:30:09] that where when he spoke it was deity
[1:30:12] speaking
[1:30:15] he was the first one that came to
[1:30:17] maturity
[1:30:19] that was Melchizedek
[1:30:22] appearing according to promise and
[1:30:24] taking a bride member
[1:30:26] and bringing his word into full
[1:30:28] manifestation
[1:30:29] to prove to you what I did in him I'm
[1:30:33] going to do in you also
[1:30:36] the very word I manifested in the
[1:30:38] prophet I'm going to manifest in you

[1:36:43] and had power to take your life up again

[1:36:49] to think that all that Adam had lost
[1:36:54] there is no one worthy that could take
