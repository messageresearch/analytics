[39:58] heavenly father
[40:01] lord no doubt
[40:04] father we're all looking forward to that
[40:05] day oh god
[40:09] lord i just couldn't help but be struck
[40:10] it oh god how we live
[40:12] as christians we live a life of a
[40:14] paradox as your prophet told us
[40:18] lord we
[40:19] in the flesh lord we
[40:22] mourn the losses that happen in our
[40:24] lives
[40:26] lord i think of even our sister lord as
[40:28] she's gone on to be with you father
[40:30] i may not have known her lord according
[40:33] to the flesh particularly but according
[40:35] to the the spirit and the holy ghost
[40:37] lord that's among your believers lord we
[40:40] i believe it was your your prophet paul
[40:42] lord spoke if if one part of the body
[40:45] grieves there's not the rest of it hurt
[40:46] with it oh god
[40:48] lord certainly we grieve according to
[40:50] those things oh lord we think of the
[40:52] different titles that our sister would
[40:54] have held a mother a wife a
[40:56] daughter a grandmother i believe maybe
[40:58] even a great grandmother father and we
[41:00] mourn according to those
[41:02] offices that she held but oh god in our
[41:05] soul there's a rejoicing to greater
[41:07] offices lord
[41:08] to know that she was a daughter of god
[41:11] to know that she's a member of the bride
[41:12] of jesus christ oh god
[41:15] lord and so we mourn according to the
[41:17] flesh o god but in our souls and our
[41:19] spirits we can rejoice
[41:21] knowing that we'll understand it all by
[41:23] and by father and all the different
[41:24] things that we go through in our lives
[41:26] lord
[41:27] lord you gave us this great promise that
[41:29] all things work together for good
[41:32] lord to them that are the called
[41:33] according to your purpose so father
[41:36] and as we've come to hear from you this
[41:37] evening oh god we just pray
[41:39] that you'd bind up the brokenhearted
[41:42] lord you'd heal
[41:43] the wounded lord
[41:45] lord you deliver those that are
[41:47] afflicted and oppressed
[41:49] lord you'd heal those lord that are
[41:51] under sickness and even spiritual
[41:53] sickness oh god
[41:56] lord for only you can do it father and
[41:58] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[41:59] so god we just
[42:01] come in the sweetness of the holy ghost
[42:03] right now and just brood over your
[42:05] people this evening lord
[42:07] as we open the word lord we know that
[42:09] only one can truly open up the word and
[42:11] that's you o father
[42:13] that tutor lord the holy ghost the
[42:15] comforter that's come to speak to each
[42:17] and every one this evening may we come
[42:19] with expectation to hear from you father
[42:22] may we each get out of the way lord and
[42:24] lord may you just
[42:26] work your miracles lord in the hearts of
[42:28] each one of your people oh god
[42:31] we thank you lord for your grace and
[42:33] mercy ask that you're perfect what would
[42:34] be done this evening lord
[42:37] and just as you'd be with us now as we
[42:39] open up your word in the name of the
[42:40] lord jesus christ we pray
[42:42] amen amen we'll just get right into the
[42:45] word if you would
[42:49] i'm going to read a couple scriptures
[42:52] john chapter 17.
[43:04] how many of you glad to be in the house
[43:06] of lord this evening
[43:12] and then if you just want to at least
[43:14] have it in your minds after we read here
[43:16] we'll go to first corinthians chapter
[43:17] 13.
[43:20] well we'll read just a little bit here
[43:22] we'll start at verse 11 and and we'll
[43:24] read on down to verse 19 and john
[43:27] chapter 17
[43:30] and the lord said and now
[43:32] i am no more in the world but these are
[43:34] in the world and i come to thee
[43:38] holy father keep through thine own name
[43:40] those whom thou has given me that they
[43:42] may be one as we are
[43:45] while i was with them in the world i
[43:46] kept them in thy name
[43:48] those that thou gave us me i have kept
[43:50] and none of them is lost but the son of
[43:53] perdition that the scripture might be
[43:55] fulfilled
[43:56] and now i come to thee and these things
[43:58] i speak in the world that they might
[44:00] have my joy fulfilled in themselves
[44:03] i have given them thy word
[44:06] and the world hath hated them because
[44:08] they are not of the world even as i am
[44:10] not of the world
[44:11] i pray not that thou should has take
[44:13] them out of the world but thou should
[44:15] has keep but that thou should has keep
[44:16] them from the evil
[44:18] they are not of the world even as i am
[44:20] not of the world
[44:21] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[44:24] is truth
[44:26] as thou has sent me into the world even
[44:28] so have i also sent them into the world
[44:31] and for their sakes i sanctify myself
[44:34] that they also might be sanctified
[44:36] through the truth
[44:38] amen let's just turn to first
[44:39] corinthians chapter
[44:41] 13.
[44:46] and we'll just read one familiar
[44:48] scripture there in verse 11.
[44:57] when i was a child i spake as a child
[45:00] i understood as a child i thought as a
[45:02] child
[45:03] but when i became a man i put away
[45:05] childish things
[45:07] amen let's just
[45:08] bow our heads one more time in a word of
[45:10] prayer heavenly father's now we've read
[45:11] your word oh god we just ask that your
[45:14] holy spirit oh god would just come now
[45:16] and reveal it to the hearts of your
[45:18] children this evening lord just once
[45:20] again we ask that you'd have your
[45:21] perfect will and way in the name of the
[45:23] lord jesus christ we pray amen may you
[45:26] may be seated
[45:28] now good
[45:30] and uh
[45:34] my wife gave me permission to tell this
[45:35] story that just happened before
[45:37] service here so i'm gonna tell it but uh
[45:40] the devil devil likes to fight in every
[45:42] way he can
[45:43] he can think of and
[45:45] i was kind of
[45:46] just kind of trying to meditate a little
[45:48] bit on the word and get ready for
[45:49] service and
[45:50] all of a sudden i
[45:52] walked out into the the kitchen and i
[45:54] kind of smelled a weird smell and
[45:56] my wife's got a my little tool box that
[45:58] i have sitting on the kitchen counter
[46:00] and she's got a hair dryer stuck to her
[46:02] head
[46:02] and the devil
[46:04] had the hair dryer suck in hair through
[46:05] the back of the hair dryer
[46:07] and so we spent about 20 minutes right
[46:09] before i tried to come to leave for
[46:10] service i was disassembling a hair dryer
[46:13] and trying to get the hair out of there
[46:14] by the grace of god we were able to get
[46:16] through there and
[46:18] it's just amazing you know i was
[46:19] thinking about it because we were doing
[46:20] that and had to break off a piece of the
[46:22] hair dryer then start taking the screws
[46:24] out and disassembling it because it got
[46:25] stuck in the little fan
[46:27] and uh you know we didn't want to
[46:29] obviously pull the hair out there and
[46:30] damage anything as best we could so
[46:33] taking there had her sit down there and
[46:34] i'm kind of acting like a surgeon on the
[46:37] on the on the hair dryer and uh we're by
[46:40] the grace of god got it all disassembled
[46:41] and took it out and the last little
[46:43] piece there's like a little you sisters
[46:45] would probably know you know more than
[46:46] anybody but there's usually they have
[46:48] like a little mesh guard on the back of
[46:50] the hair dryer where the air flows in to
[46:52] stop things from getting sucked in there
[46:54] well the hair had gotten sucked right
[46:56] through that little hole
[46:57] and it was kind of stuck in there so you
[46:59] couldn't really get it out and i didn't
[47:00] really want to take some metal things to
[47:02] cut it because i didn't want to risk
[47:03] cutting her hair
[47:04] and so we're just kind of trying to
[47:05] slowly gently get the hair through the
[47:07] hole and the lord kind of put it on my
[47:09] mind we should just get some
[47:11] oil some coconut oil and put it on there
[47:13] to get it like slick like and get it
[47:15] through there and and i and we by the
[47:16] grace of god we got it out of there and
[47:18] i was thinking about it the lord kind of
[47:19] quickened it to me it's like it's
[47:21] amazing how that tree and lounge of good
[47:23] and evil would try to take out the word
[47:25] of god take out my wife's hair
[47:27] but but the lord said you just put a
[47:28] little oil on it you know just massage a
[47:30] little oil into it there and uh and the
[47:33] lord will make it out come out right so
[47:34] i think a lot of times that's what we
[47:36] need to do right is just apply apply
[47:38] that token apply the holy ghost apply a
[47:40] little bit of that to the problem and
[47:41] we'll see the lord will work us right
[47:43] through it so
[47:45] and i just i told my wife i was like
[47:46] well if the devil is fighting that hard
[47:47] then it must be we must be getting ready
[47:49] to have a good service so
[47:50] i said praise the lord for that you take
[47:52] comfort in those things and
[47:54] um
[47:55] you know i
[47:57] i
[47:58] was uh
[47:59] let me just tell you where i got the
[48:00] inspiration here and uh just kind of
[48:02] listen to the message he cares do you
[48:04] care and
[48:08] maybe not taking a lot necessarily
[48:10] directly from that message maybe just
[48:11] mostly the inspiration but it kind of
[48:13] quickened something the lord had kind of
[48:15] put on my heart a few months ago and
[48:17] and
[48:18] you know as we're coming up into this
[48:21] right at the time of the rapture you
[48:22] know i we were we've been talking a lot
[48:24] lately about how as christians were
[48:27] we're coming to a place of maturity
[48:29] and we're called as paul said we're not
[48:32] called even though we're called to have
[48:33] the faith of little children he said if
[48:36] you accept you be as this
[48:37] have the faith of this little one you
[48:39] can in no wise enter the kingdom but at
[48:41] the same time we're also called to come
[48:43] up in maturity the lord is calling us to
[48:46] a higher place not to be caught to and
[48:48] fro with all the cares of the world and
[48:50] all the things that the world chases
[48:52] after
[48:53] and i just had this thought
[48:56] about
[48:58] sanctification
[48:59] and if i were to have a title i guess
[49:01] that would just be the title
[49:03] sanctification the lord really had
[49:05] struck it on me this particular
[49:07] scripture in john
[49:09] chapter 17 where the lord jesus says he
[49:12] says and for their sakes i've sanctified
[49:14] myself
[49:16] and i thought about how powerful
[49:18] of a of a thought that was how jesus
[49:20] came and he and he sanctified himself
[49:24] and
[49:24] and many times
[49:26] we think about that word sanctification
[49:28] we understand it's a compound word
[49:29] cleaned and set aside for service how
[49:31] many of you heard that we've probably
[49:33] heard that uh a hundred thousand times
[49:34] if we heard it once
[49:36] and and i really thought that the lord
[49:37] really impressed upon my heart the the
[49:39] second half of that you know so many
[49:41] times we focus sanctification we got to
[49:44] clean up we got to clean up we got to
[49:45] clean up and no doubt we have to watch
[49:47] those things we must continually be
[49:49] underneath that washing of the water by
[49:51] the word even the lord before he even
[49:53] talked about how i i've sanctified
[49:55] myself he said he said sanctify them
[49:57] through your truth and thy word is truth
[50:00] and by the preaching of that word the
[50:02] the washing power of the word sitting
[50:05] underneath the word as we come to
[50:07] service and in our daily lives
[50:09] meditating upon the word of god and and
[50:11] listening to the word and god is
[50:13] constantly washing us out i believe the
[50:15] lord with the prophet he talked about
[50:17] that rock box just being constantly
[50:19] washed out on top of the hill just
[50:21] bubbling and boiling out all the trash
[50:24] and different things in our lives and
[50:25] when we come to the service of the lord
[50:27] here at the at the church or even at
[50:29] home listening to a tape or something or
[50:32] listening to a previous message here at
[50:34] the church even the that water of the
[50:36] word is always new it's always fresh
[50:38] because the lord promised it would be a
[50:40] well springing up into eternal life of
[50:42] living water
[50:44] it's not just old dead letter it's not
[50:46] just a ritual
[50:48] and brothers and sisters we haven't come
[50:49] here for a ritual we haven't come here
[50:52] just because it's our duty to come here
[50:54] although it is your duty to come here
[50:55] but we haven't come here just to fulfill
[50:57] a duty many times i think we kind of get
[51:00] caught up the lord kind of really i
[51:02] thought about that term you know people
[51:03] get caught up in the rat race i said
[51:05] well there's a reason we shouldn't get
[51:07] caught up in the rat races because we're
[51:08] not racks
[51:09] we're eagles we're supposed to soar
[51:11] above those things and i think so many
[51:13] times because of the way the world is
[51:15] constructed now and everybody's running
[51:17] to and fro even the book of daniel said
[51:19] that men would do that they'd run to and
[51:21] fro knowledge would increase
[51:23] and and if we're not careful our spirits
[51:25] get caught up into that to where even
[51:27] with good intentions the things that we
[51:29] do in our lives maybe just become a
[51:31] ritualistic
[51:32] religion
[51:34] and
[51:35] we don't want we're not just about it's
[51:36] not just a religion to us
[51:38] this this message that we've received is
[51:40] not just a it's not just a religion but
[51:43] it is life
[51:44] it's not just a covering that we have i
[51:47] believe our brother even spoke this
[51:49] weekend about it's not just coming
[51:50] underneath the umbrella of what we call
[51:51] a message but it's being born into a
[51:54] body it's being born into an actual life
[51:58] that's lived out through the believer
[52:01] but as i was meditating on these things
[52:03] in the lord just impressing upon me
[52:05] about sanctification and
[52:07] and how many times
[52:09] we focus on oh we've got to clean up and
[52:11] and no doubt we all have things in our
[52:13] lives that we're trying to clean up
[52:16] there's all things in our lives many
[52:17] times we fall short and i believe we've
[52:20] even spoken before as a as brother
[52:22] brandon even told the story of the the
[52:24] one who had the i believe he had the
[52:26] dream where he had gone on and he's
[52:27] getting closer to that closer to that
[52:29] light and as he got closer to that light
[52:31] the things he thought weren't so bad
[52:32] became darker and darker and if you come
[52:34] to realize that the little things you
[52:36] let slip they weren't as they weren't as
[52:39] uh
[52:40] not they you thought they weren't so bad
[52:43] but you as you get closer to the lord
[52:45] you start to see you start to become to
[52:47] a more realization of just how holy he
[52:50] is
[52:51] of just how perfect god is and how much
[52:54] how much how short we fall of it when we
[52:57] try to do it ourselves
[52:59] god's called us to a higher place
[53:05] you know if we read if you were to read
[53:07] on
[53:07] in john chapter 17 there after that the
[53:10] lord jesus is constantly talking about
[53:13] how he would he's trying to bring us to
[53:14] that place where we would be even as he
[53:17] is with the father how i would that they
[53:19] be one even as we are one and i want
[53:22] them to have the glory that i shared
[53:24] with you i've shared with them that way
[53:26] they may be one as we are one see the
[53:28] lord jesus is trying to bring his bride
[53:31] to a place of oneness and fellowship
[53:34] with him to where that life that was in
[53:37] christ is being expressed through his
[53:39] people just the same
[53:42] not a deluded form
[53:44] not something a little bit less
[53:46] but that very same life
[53:50] we put everything on a pedestal out of
[53:52] reach the devil always puts it all out
[53:53] of reach oh you can't possibly reach
[53:55] that you can't possibly reach that but
[53:57] but the only bar that's been set
[54:00] is jesus christ
[54:02] and many times we're measuring ourselves
[54:04] against ourselves
[54:06] looking at one another oh if i could
[54:08] just live like brother matthew or if i
[54:10] could just live like brother david or
[54:12] you know maybe maybe many people look at
[54:14] their pastor and say oh i just wish i
[54:17] could live like them
[54:19] but i i really had you know and forgive
[54:21] me if i seem a little scattered it's
[54:23] just the way the lord deals with me
[54:24] sometimes and the way he brings it but
[54:27] i thought about
[54:28] the idea of leadership
[54:30] and i think maybe what the lord kind of
[54:32] got there because i know our pastor is
[54:34] kind of going along the lines of some of
[54:36] the last messages that brother branham
[54:38] preached and i know one of the last ones
[54:39] he ministered was on leadership and i
[54:41] started thinking you know the world has
[54:42] perverted that the idea of true
[54:45] leadership
[54:46] of what it means to be a real leader see
[54:48] everybody everybody wants a a worldly
[54:51] leader is someone who takes credit for
[54:53] all the good things and puts blame for
[54:56] all the bad things it's so i will take
[54:58] credit for all but real leadership is is
[55:01] see in order to be a real i i
[55:03] i wish i could the lord would help me to
[55:06] explain it the way i see it you know you
[55:07] can't really speak a revelation
[55:09] necessarily the lord's got to give it
[55:11] but you know in order to be a true
[55:13] leader
[55:14] you have to be a true follower first
[55:19] you have to be a true follower
[55:22] how paul could say follow me as i follow
[55:25] christ
[55:26] because there was a there was a
[55:28] fellowship in a leadership that he was
[55:31] being led by
[55:32] and therefore he could cause people to
[55:35] follow that same leading because he was
[55:37] never pointing to himself even our
[55:40] prophet the same way would say it's not
[55:43] me
[55:44] but it's him
[55:45] he's the one that's here he's the one
[55:47] doing the works if you're going to
[55:49] follow anybody follow the lord jesus
[55:53] and that's the leadership that we're
[55:54] looking to have the world would say oh
[55:57] follow me i want to do this i'm going to
[55:58] do this i'm going to do this that i i
[56:01] will see we're coming back to a garden
[56:02] of eden condition
[56:05] both sides the devil
[56:07] as well as the bride is coming back to a
[56:10] place of of where the devil began
[56:13] when he said i will ascend above the
[56:15] throne of god i'll ascend above the
[56:17] stars of god i'll exalt myself above all
[56:19] those things
[56:20] and meanwhile the bride of christ is
[56:23] becoming more and more humble more and
[56:25] more little in her own sight so that she
[56:27] can she can live in the will of her
[56:30] husband
[56:33] because that's where the bride
[56:35] has to live
[56:36] is in the will of her own husband not
[56:39] our own will not our own ideas
[56:42] i thought i remember i saw you know all
[56:44] the the athletic companies they always
[56:46] had their little campaigns and
[56:47] everything and i remember seeing one
[56:49] that just struck me you know they had
[56:51] nike as those the the you know just do
[56:53] it and all these things and i've never
[56:54] seen one for under armour they've had it
[56:57] i think they're still doing it and i
[56:58] remember seeing it we had been in like a
[57:00] shopping center and they had it
[57:01] plastered on all the walls and you know
[57:04] what it was it was a very it was it was
[57:06] satan's motto it said i will
[57:09] that was the under that's the under
[57:11] armour model right now is i will
[57:14] trying to make it up to me something you
[57:15] know when the going gets tough on the
[57:17] gridiron i will you know tackle the guy
[57:19] or whatever it is they're gonna do with
[57:21] their sports and all the things but it
[57:23] was i will do this i will do that i will
[57:27] do this
[57:28] and we can see the very nature of satan
[57:31] just brooding over the people of the
[57:33] world
[57:34] meanwhile the bride is coming to a place
[57:37] that's like jesus was nevertheless not
[57:40] my will but thought be done
[57:44] that's leadership
[57:46] that's that's true leadership is
[57:48] allowing him to lead
[57:50] see the lord jesus came he said to be an
[57:53] example for us to show us what we could
[57:56] do and if the very son of god
[57:59] god in flesh himself our example would
[58:03] say i can do nothing
[58:05] except the father's will shows me
[58:10] so then never did jesus say because i
[58:12] will
[58:13] no he said the only thing i will do is i
[58:17] will surrender
[58:18] all that i am to the will of the father
[58:22] and that is that is the place the bride
[58:25] is coming to brothers and sisters it's
[58:27] coming to a place of laying aside
[58:30] everything that you thought you wanted
[58:32] to be
[58:33] we sing that song all of my ambitions
[58:36] hopes and plans
[58:38] i surrender these into your hands but
[58:40] how much have we truly surrendered i
[58:42] want to issue a challenge to the people
[58:44] of god
[58:45] because there's got to come to a place
[58:48] where we are so surrendered the prophet
[58:50] said if he could just get one person
[58:53] fully in his hand not part way
[58:56] not a little bit of the way not a
[58:58] fraction of the way but sold out to god
[59:01] he'd shake the world and he did it
[59:04] through a prophet
[59:05] we call him william branham but there
[59:07] was nothing but a man
[59:10] that had surrendered himself that's why
[59:12] we don't point to the man himself
[59:15] because we understand the reason god
[59:17] could use him
[59:19] was because he'd come to a place of
[59:20] surrender
[59:22] he had his struggles and i love i
[59:25] appreciate brother branham because he
[59:26] would admit those things how he had to
[59:29] lose his wife and his daughter for
[59:31] disobeying god but god had to show him
[59:34] that the only way to fulfill the calling
[59:37] in his life that god had was to be
[59:39] totally surrendered
[59:43] seemed like a little thing to give into
[59:46] a little pressure from your
[59:47] mother-in-law
[59:48] and look what it cost him but god was
[59:50] teaching him a lesson
[59:53] i remember reading on the life story and
[59:54] all the different books that you know
[59:56] when they talk about the stories and
[59:57] brother branham talked when he went to
[59:59] south africa
[1:00:00] and they had the agenda laid out for him
[1:00:02] and the lord said go here
[1:00:03] and all the minister brethren come to
[1:00:05] pressure him
[1:00:07] brethren
[1:00:08] the ones that are sponsoring him
[1:00:10] and they say
[1:00:12] oh but we've already scheduled this and
[1:00:13] this and this and this
[1:00:16] and see and you and we put ourselves in
[1:00:17] those shoes oh surely if i had an angel
[1:00:19] of the lord visiting me
[1:00:21] i would have just turned my back on
[1:00:22] those guys and went
[1:00:25] but you don't know the pressure that
[1:00:26] he's under
[1:00:28] you could you imagine being you're a
[1:00:30] small town
[1:00:32] what you call in his own eyes he was a
[1:00:33] nobody
[1:00:34] he said he was uneducated
[1:00:36] and yet he's got all these ministers
[1:00:38] trying to push him and push him and push
[1:00:40] him all these push and pull and then the
[1:00:42] angel says go ahead but you're going to
[1:00:43] suffer and he suffered but why god's
[1:00:46] teaching him
[1:00:47] and god see we get ourselves into our
[1:00:50] own situations and our own problems we
[1:00:52] suffer
[1:00:54] we suffer trials and tribulations
[1:00:57] we get spanked we get beat down
[1:00:59] sometimes
[1:01:01] it isn't always because of disobedience
[1:01:02] don't get me wrong
[1:01:05] remember blessings are not a surefire
[1:01:09] sign of god's approval
[1:01:11] and tribulations are not a sure-fire
[1:01:13] sign of god's disapproval so remember
[1:01:15] there's balance you go one side or the
[1:01:17] other someone will go out of here say
[1:01:18] bless god i must be doing okay i'm just
[1:01:21] right on track that doesn't mean that we
[1:01:22] better be watching up with this word the
[1:01:24] word is the ultimate line
[1:01:27] but see the lord is trying to get us to
[1:01:29] a place where we are so surrendered
[1:01:32] so totally gone from our own thoughts
[1:01:34] and ideas
[1:01:36] that his words he can't trust
[1:01:39] he can't trust
[1:01:41] his power
[1:01:43] his his virtue
[1:01:45] to someone who would wield it brother
[1:01:47] branham said his power without character
[1:01:49] is
[1:01:50] satanic so if we want to come to a place
[1:01:53] where we can say all i want to do in the
[1:01:55] greater works oh we want to do this and
[1:01:57] see this happen we must be fully
[1:01:59] surrendered to him
[1:02:02] and i thought about this as as jesus
[1:02:05] said i sanctify myself for their sakes
[1:02:09] oh what an example for the people of god
[1:02:13] how we ought to be
[1:02:15] underneath that word
[1:02:17] cleansing ourselves and then on top of
[1:02:19] that setting ourselves aside
[1:02:22] for service to the lord
[1:02:24] and not just for our own sake
[1:02:27] remember this the thought that just has
[1:02:29] been really pressing is it what is
[1:02:30] eternal life it's living for others
[1:02:33] what is eternal life it's living for
[1:02:35] others
[1:02:36] and and where so many we live for
[1:02:38] ourselves in so many things
[1:02:41] i'm just issuing a challenge this isn't
[1:02:43] meant to to beat anybody down
[1:02:46] this isn't meant to bring anybody under
[1:02:48] condemnation but if there is conviction
[1:02:50] praise the lord for conviction
[1:02:54] but i we're in such a selfish age
[1:02:57] everybody wants what they want
[1:02:59] i want my rights i want this i want that
[1:03:02] i have a right to this and i have a
[1:03:03] right to that
[1:03:05] but we've got to lay that down
[1:03:07] god wants to see us i believe he said
[1:03:10] paul said look not unto your own things
[1:03:12] but under the things of others and he
[1:03:14] wasn't talking about always looking oh
[1:03:16] wow brother david's got a new truck i
[1:03:17] sure want that truck no that's not
[1:03:19] that's not he's not talking about that
[1:03:21] he's talking about with care
[1:03:23] about about being watchful being a
[1:03:25] watchman being being careful to watch
[1:03:28] over your brothers and sisters is in a
[1:03:29] protective manner in a caring manner in
[1:03:32] a in a you know the way the lord looked
[1:03:34] after his people the way of the lord is
[1:03:37] always on the guard ready to to get down
[1:03:40] and attack that devil when he gets on a
[1:03:42] brother or sister
[1:03:46] but we get we get selfish
[1:03:48] it's easy to do that's why the lord
[1:03:51] really put the scripture on my heart in
[1:03:53] in first corinthians said when i was a
[1:03:55] child
[1:03:56] i thought as a child i speak as a child
[1:03:58] i acted as a child
[1:03:59] that's my toy
[1:04:02] that's my thing i want this
[1:04:04] and we see that amongst people sometimes
[1:04:06] oh i want i want that ministry or i want
[1:04:08] to do this job and it looks good maybe
[1:04:11] that maybe in their in their minds
[1:04:13] they've got good intentions oh because i
[1:04:15] want to do something for the lord but
[1:04:17] you have to do what the lord's got for
[1:04:18] you to do
[1:04:20] david had his good intentions he said i
[1:04:22] want to build a temple unto the lord
[1:04:24] and and i believe it was nathan said
[1:04:26] that's a good idea
[1:04:27] but it's not for you to do
[1:04:30] i i love it because just because the
[1:04:32] lord put something in it may not be for
[1:04:34] you doesn't mean it's wrong
[1:04:36] it just might not be for you to do maybe
[1:04:38] the lord's given it to you to inspire
[1:04:40] someone else
[1:04:41] and i loved what is david's response
[1:04:43] david didn't kick his feet and say well
[1:04:46] bless god i'm the king so i should be
[1:04:48] able to do whatever i want
[1:04:50] what did he say he said no he said if i
[1:04:52] can't do it i'm going to put my shoulder
[1:04:54] to the wheel
[1:04:55] and do everything i can do to help the
[1:04:58] one that will
[1:05:01] he won't even think about building our
[1:05:02] new church here not everyone's going to
[1:05:04] be driving nail
[1:05:06] not everyone's going to be there cutting
[1:05:08] wood or putting shingles on
[1:05:11] but if you can't do any of those things
[1:05:12] the very least we could do is pray for
[1:05:14] the cause
[1:05:16] the very least we could do when brother
[1:05:18] brahm called blocking for the one with
[1:05:19] the ball
[1:05:21] get that on your knees
[1:05:23] get out there spiritually and say lord
[1:05:26] i've heard my pastor talking about those
[1:05:29] guys with the permits and everything
[1:05:31] lord soften the hearts
[1:05:34] lord remove every obstacle
[1:05:37] why because god's in control
[1:05:41] but i thought about as i'm listening to
[1:05:42] that message he cares to you care
[1:05:44] brother branham said something a number
[1:05:46] of times through that message he says
[1:05:48] god cares but he first he wants to see
[1:05:51] that you care first
[1:05:54] and many times we sit back and say lord
[1:05:57] if you care well you just do something
[1:05:59] and the lord says well if you don't care
[1:06:01] enough to do a little something
[1:06:05] well then maybe you don't really care
[1:06:10] and it's not that you save yourself
[1:06:13] but see remember the lord's working on
[1:06:14] both ends
[1:06:17] you say oh well
[1:06:19] the christian going to church and
[1:06:20] everything going to a church doesn't
[1:06:22] make you a christian
[1:06:23] no that's true
[1:06:25] but a christian goes to church
[1:06:30] you know doing the works of god
[1:06:32] just doing the natural work doesn't make
[1:06:34] you a christian
[1:06:35] because if that was the case there's a
[1:06:37] lot of people out there that have us all
[1:06:38] beat
[1:06:40] brother bran talked about the kind old
[1:06:41] priests those pharisees who was always
[1:06:44] there for you
[1:06:45] looks good on the outside no but a
[1:06:47] christian will do those things
[1:06:50] i believe the last time we ministered we
[1:06:51] talked about that boogie man the devil's
[1:06:53] always putting the scarecrows out there
[1:06:56] the scarecrows are to help us to rejoice
[1:06:59] because it proves that the real is out
[1:07:01] there to be had
[1:07:04] and when the devil puts a scarecrow out
[1:07:05] they said bless the lord there must be
[1:07:08] something in that field
[1:07:09] that the devil don't want me to get
[1:07:12] because he's putting all these fakes out
[1:07:13] there trying to run me away from it
[1:07:17] well what's the thing about a scarecrow
[1:07:18] he ain't got no life to him
[1:07:20] he can't move
[1:07:22] he's stuck
[1:07:26] but we've got
[1:07:27] we've got to get to a place
[1:07:30] where that nature where we've dissolved
[1:07:32] our our own nature our own desires and
[1:07:35] all these things just let the lord come
[1:07:38] in and just take complete control
[1:07:45] he said i sanctify myself for their
[1:07:47] sakes
[1:07:49] you know we we look at things so many
[1:07:51] times and hey i'm guilty i look at my
[1:07:54] life and say lord woe is me
[1:07:56] i'm fighting this and i'm fighting that
[1:07:59] and i'm struggling here and
[1:08:01] my face feels sore because i've face
[1:08:03] planted on it so many times
[1:08:07] but you know you know the ultimate
[1:08:09] motivation you'll find
[1:08:11] is when
[1:08:12] you know i found this out you know
[1:08:15] when i got married and the lord hasn't
[1:08:17] blessed us with children yet but by the
[1:08:18] grace of god we know they're coming
[1:08:22] but even just being married
[1:08:24] you find out you have different
[1:08:25] priorities
[1:08:27] you know it used to be i go to work
[1:08:30] you know if i didn't feel good
[1:08:32] oh well i don't care i just won't go to
[1:08:34] work today because it's only me i got to
[1:08:35] worry about
[1:08:37] i can live off of spaghetti for another
[1:08:39] two months i don't you know it doesn't
[1:08:40] bother me but now that i got a wife
[1:08:42] she didn't want to eat spaghetti for a
[1:08:44] month and a half straight like i did
[1:08:45] before
[1:08:47] she she wants to at least to get a nice
[1:08:48] turkey sandwich in there sometimes
[1:08:51] you know so your priorities become
[1:08:53] different what happens you start to
[1:08:54] learn that the life that you're living
[1:08:58] isn't just for you anymore
[1:09:01] that life that you're you're living that
[1:09:03] when i go to work
[1:09:05] i'm not going to work just because of
[1:09:06] myself i'm going there because i have
[1:09:08] responsibilities now
[1:09:11] you know as a christian as we're
[1:09:12] maturing you know what is that that's
[1:09:14] called being more mature
[1:09:16] you know i i was young i was working
[1:09:18] different jobs all by myself i could you
[1:09:21] know do whatever he wanted to do
[1:09:22] quit that job move on to another one do
[1:09:24] this do that i think before the lord
[1:09:26] blessed me with what i have to either
[1:09:27] work like 15 different jobs
[1:09:29] you know trying to find what i wanted to
[1:09:31] do couldn't find nothing either they
[1:09:33] didn't like me well enough or i didn't
[1:09:34] like them well enough
[1:09:35] and i would move on and the lord blessed
[1:09:38] me to have those
[1:09:39] but it was immaturity many times because
[1:09:42] he just well i don't want to do this
[1:09:43] anymore so i'm going to do something
[1:09:44] else
[1:09:45] but then once you once you get to a
[1:09:46] place where i got responsibilities i've
[1:09:48] got to come up a little higher
[1:09:51] i'm not some i'm not i'm not the only
[1:09:53] one depending on this anymore i've got
[1:09:55] someone else that i'm looking out for
[1:09:57] and that's what is that it's growing up
[1:09:59] that's becoming more mature it's
[1:10:00] realizing that your life doesn't affect
[1:10:03] just you
[1:10:05] and when you become married to christ
[1:10:08] your life doesn't affect just you
[1:10:10] anymore
[1:10:11] your life affects you look around just
[1:10:13] look i want you to take a look around at
[1:10:14] this building right now this isn't even
[1:10:16] everyone that goes
[1:10:18] your life affects every single person in
[1:10:20] here
[1:10:21] you're not living for yourself anymore
[1:10:26] whether you realize it or not your life
[1:10:28] affects every one of us
[1:10:34] someone's healing could be hindered or
[1:10:37] helped
[1:10:38] by your attitude towards the word of god
[1:10:41] someone's deliverance that they've been
[1:10:43] waiting years for could be hindered or
[1:10:46] helped by your attitude
[1:10:48] and the way you're living your life
[1:10:50] and the way you come into the presence
[1:10:52] of god
[1:10:54] because god doesn't play games
[1:10:58] maybe times we've got a little too
[1:10:59] comfortable
[1:11:00] was saying we're the bride well that
[1:11:02] we'll see the bride of christ even
[1:11:04] esther when she went before the king she
[1:11:06] went down and she touched the golden
[1:11:07] scepter
[1:11:10] and she said oh lord
[1:11:12] you know what you whatever you want if
[1:11:14] you just let me have this but she went
[1:11:16] with reference and respect
[1:11:20] and we ought to come to the house of god
[1:11:22] with reference with respect with
[1:11:25] expectation
[1:11:28] we come knowing who we are
[1:11:31] but also knowing who he is
[1:11:33] the king of kings the lord of lords
[1:11:37] the lord of glory be out we sing these
[1:11:39] songs
[1:11:40] he is the lord of glory he is the great
[1:11:42] i am
[1:11:44] do we have a real comprehension
[1:11:47] a revelation of what that is the very
[1:11:49] god of heaven
[1:11:51] is here right
[1:11:52] now and he can touch you where you sit
[1:11:56] if you can accept it
[1:11:58] if we could get into that atmosphere
[1:12:04] and you know he'll do it probably many
[1:12:05] times right when you're not expecting it
[1:12:08] right when you go out of your way maybe
[1:12:09] to pray for your brother or sister the
[1:12:11] lord will come by your way why because
[1:12:13] it pleases him
[1:12:15] when he sees his children living for
[1:12:17] each other
[1:12:19] look not unto the things of yourselves
[1:12:21] but look each one to the things of one
[1:12:23] another
[1:12:24] what does my brother have need of
[1:12:27] you know you could be in tune with the
[1:12:28] things of god that way you could see a
[1:12:30] brother or sister downtrodden
[1:12:32] fighting come in here and pray the lord
[1:12:35] we know brother branham taught that
[1:12:37] because he tell the people you put your
[1:12:39] hand one on another and don't pray for
[1:12:41] yourself
[1:12:42] you pray for one another
[1:12:44] why that's eternal life
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:50] he wants us to depend fully on him
[1:12:54] if we were
[1:12:55] you know we're part of a body
[1:12:58] he wants us to be completely dependent
[1:12:59] on him we had we heard the brother
[1:13:01] preach the other the other morning
[1:13:03] mastering the thought of human ability
[1:13:06] it ain't based on how well i can preach
[1:13:08] because if i was well we're all doomed
[1:13:10] right now because i know i can't do
[1:13:12] anything
[1:13:13] i know enough about myself to know that
[1:13:16] i'm just dust to dust in this flesh
[1:13:19] but by the grace of god he he he put a
[1:13:22] gift
[1:13:23] to maybe get a little bit out of the way
[1:13:25] and you can pull on the gift that god
[1:13:27] can work
[1:13:28] we believe in a five-fold ministry
[1:13:31] but we also believe in the ministry of
[1:13:32] the body one to another
[1:13:35] there's such a balance to all of it see
[1:13:38] because god doesn't want us just to
[1:13:40] depend solely
[1:13:41] if every if all my hopes always hinge
[1:13:43] when brother matthew would preach
[1:13:45] because i just liked the way he preached
[1:13:47] and i always felt like i got so much
[1:13:48] under that and that may be true
[1:13:50] but if i hinder my hopes on that well
[1:13:52] then that becomes an idol to me
[1:13:55] but if we could just get ourselves out
[1:13:57] of the way
[1:13:58] see getting out of the way isn't just
[1:14:01] isn't just exclusive to the minister
[1:14:04] it's to the people of god to receive
[1:14:06] what god's got for them
[1:14:10] i hope this is okay
[1:14:12] i want to see i want to see the p see
[1:14:15] the the people of god are overcomers
[1:14:17] you may not even know it yet but you're
[1:14:19] an overcomer
[1:14:20] you may not see it yet but you're an
[1:14:22] overcomer why because that seed that's
[1:14:25] in you has already overcome he said fear
[1:14:27] not little i've already overcome
[1:14:29] the world that's just not it just hasn't
[1:14:31] you haven't seen it yet
[1:14:33] it's stamped in the mail it's already
[1:14:35] sealed
[1:14:36] it's about to be it's being delivered
[1:14:38] right now
[1:14:40] it's kind of a double meaning
[1:14:42] it's going to be delivered and you'll
[1:14:44] get to deliver
[1:14:45] it's coming
[1:14:46] it's here
[1:14:48] god's waiting on us
[1:14:50] he wants we have to be more sincere
[1:14:52] that's another thing i heard brother
[1:14:53] branham speak in that message he cares
[1:14:55] that you care he talked about it so he
[1:14:56] said we've got there's got to be more
[1:14:59] sincerity
[1:15:00] there's got to be a deeper sincerity and
[1:15:03] i believe there is a lot of sincerity
[1:15:05] here
[1:15:06] we know that
[1:15:07] but in each one of our lives let's just
[1:15:09] check it up a little more because god's
[1:15:11] calling us how many of you want more of
[1:15:13] god
[1:15:14] how many of you want to see god live in
[1:15:16] your life more well then you know what
[1:15:18] our prophet said about that if you have
[1:15:20] a hunger it shows that there's more of
[1:15:21] it for you
[1:15:23] and you couldn't hunger for it if it
[1:15:24] wasn't there
[1:15:26] so that ought to give us encouragement
[1:15:28] that only give us more of a desire to
[1:15:30] get down and say lord reveal to me what
[1:15:33] i have need of
[1:15:34] lord how can i
[1:15:36] sanctify myself
[1:15:38] lord how can i cleanse myself up and
[1:15:40] then on the other hand the one part i
[1:15:42] really want to think about is how can i
[1:15:44] set myself aside for your service
[1:15:48] that's what the thought really struck me
[1:15:49] is setting yourself remember clean and
[1:15:52] set aside for service
[1:15:54] many of us have been cleaned
[1:15:56] we've been cleansed but now our vessels
[1:15:58] are so busy running about doing this and
[1:16:00] that
[1:16:01] god wants to go reach on the shelf for
[1:16:03] you
[1:16:04] but you're off doing something else
[1:16:07] he wants us to be set aside for his
[1:16:09] service
[1:16:11] the lord jesus said i do nothing except
[1:16:14] the father show me first
[1:16:15] now that doesn't mean we all have to be
[1:16:17] seeing the visions and all these things
[1:16:20] but if i could maybe say it this way
[1:16:22] we always want to set our desires
[1:16:25] on the sideline
[1:16:26] so that any moment the master calls we
[1:16:29] would avail ourselves to him for what he
[1:16:31] wants done in that moment you think
[1:16:34] about the prophet how when he was
[1:16:36] waiting for that plane to memphis i
[1:16:38] believe if i remember right he didn't
[1:16:40] even he didn't even see a vision
[1:16:42] he just heard a voice
[1:16:44] he said just go this way
[1:16:46] and so you think there wasn't a battle
[1:16:48] there with his natural desires knowing
[1:16:51] that the plane was waiting
[1:16:53] it was going to leave
[1:16:55] but what did he do he followed the voice
[1:16:58] that still small voice and many times
[1:17:00] what is that with all those things i
[1:17:02] just said well lord i don't know but i'm
[1:17:03] just going to trust i'm going to follow
[1:17:05] i'm going to go with this leading
[1:17:08] and i'm going to go and we know that the
[1:17:09] lord held the plane
[1:17:11] but it wouldn't have been any more
[1:17:13] miraculous if he wouldn't have held the
[1:17:14] plane many times he rejoiced about the
[1:17:16] plane i rejoiced about the fact that god
[1:17:19] heard the need
[1:17:20] of one of his daughters
[1:17:22] and came on the scene
[1:17:25] and the side effect the lord said you
[1:17:26] know just to prove that i'm god of all
[1:17:28] things i'll even hold the plane for you
[1:17:34] you know i remember i went out and i i
[1:17:36] was up in ohio and i was i ministered
[1:17:38] for a brother up there this is probably
[1:17:40] last year a year and a half probably had
[1:17:42] to be a year and a half ago i don't know
[1:17:43] if it was during all the coven things or
[1:17:46] not i can't remember now time is so
[1:17:47] strange after the covid things you know
[1:17:51] but i remember afterwards i just felt
[1:17:53] led to go up and talk to my my
[1:17:54] grandfather who lives up there in
[1:17:56] michigan because i was flying out of
[1:17:57] detroit
[1:17:58] and i just felt led i had a i just felt
[1:18:00] led to really talk to him about the lord
[1:18:03] and he's a christian
[1:18:05] uh maybe more nominally but he believes
[1:18:07] in the lord i think he came out of the
[1:18:09] catholic church years and years and
[1:18:10] years ago and understands a lot with
[1:18:12] that but maybe just hasn't you know come
[1:18:14] up come up a little higher you know and
[1:18:16] i just really felt impressed like lord i
[1:18:19] got it i have to at least tell about the
[1:18:21] baptism and tell about tell them about a
[1:18:23] prophet that came to this age and at
[1:18:24] least just just show a little bit
[1:18:26] because i've maybe mentioned it before
[1:18:28] but never had a chance to really sit
[1:18:29] down with him because i don't live
[1:18:30] anywhere near him or anything
[1:18:32] and i happen to have one of the the
[1:18:33] baptismal tracks that the voice of god
[1:18:36] gives out i had him with me and i just
[1:18:37] felt such a
[1:18:39] pulling to go
[1:18:40] and we talked and i'm sitting there
[1:18:42] looking at my watch get my flight
[1:18:43] leaving in about an hour flight leaves
[1:18:45] in about 45 minutes and i'm like i ain't
[1:18:46] gonna make it but something just pulled
[1:18:48] me like i got to stay there
[1:18:50] and you know what the lord didn't hold
[1:18:51] my flight
[1:18:53] i had to catch another one
[1:18:57] but i tell you one thing
[1:18:59] the lord allowed me to change my flight
[1:19:01] without any extra costs i still made it
[1:19:04] home that night
[1:19:05] and you know what the lord put a piece
[1:19:07] on my heart to know that i did what he
[1:19:09] put on my heart to do
[1:19:10] to to minister the word to someone that
[1:19:13] needs it
[1:19:14] and you know that's as simple as it is
[1:19:17] for the people of god
[1:19:18] we want everything just to be always
[1:19:20] raped you know the lord made the lord
[1:19:22] maybe you'll let the flight you miss the
[1:19:24] flight just to test you to see what your
[1:19:26] attitude is you remember jonah
[1:19:28] think about jonah
[1:19:30] how even after all he went through
[1:19:32] coming out of the belly of the whale
[1:19:34] preaching to nineveh people repenting
[1:19:36] putting sackcloth on their animals
[1:19:39] and then he goes and pouts
[1:19:41] underneath the tree
[1:19:43] because he just got an attitude
[1:19:46] and that's sometimes the lord wants to
[1:19:48] see are you going to have a jonah
[1:19:49] attitude after i led you this way and
[1:19:52] showed you these things lord help us not
[1:19:54] to maybe have that attitude when
[1:19:56] sometimes maybe we suffer a little bit
[1:19:58] for the cause of christ like missing a
[1:20:01] flight or doing something else or maybe
[1:20:03] they you get rejected when you try to
[1:20:05] minister the word
[1:20:07] but you don't know what that seed is
[1:20:08] going to bring one planet another on
[1:20:11] water but god gives the increase
[1:20:14] i don't care who who reaps it
[1:20:17] as long as they make it
[1:20:18] and lord if you let me be part of the
[1:20:20] process praise the lord
[1:20:22] i counted a privilege in an hour just to
[1:20:24] be there a part of that to say that i
[1:20:27] put my shoulder to the wheel
[1:20:30] we've got all these expectations of how
[1:20:32] we think things ought to be
[1:20:36] oh lord we it should be this way and it
[1:20:38] should be that way you know we'll
[1:20:39] understand it better by and by
[1:20:41] maybe there are sometimes you were right
[1:20:42] maybe it should have been this way but
[1:20:44] something messed up here messed up there
[1:20:46] we don't know
[1:20:48] but you know what as long as we press
[1:20:50] towards that mark of the high calling
[1:20:53] as long as you're fixing your eyes on
[1:20:55] him like lord help us just to become
[1:20:57] real mature level just nothing can sway
[1:21:00] us anchored in the anchored in the rock
[1:21:03] the waves are going to come and go but
[1:21:05] let us just be anchored down deep in
[1:21:07] that
[1:21:08] to know that he's in total control
[1:21:14] you know
[1:21:15] the world it's it's full we were talking
[1:21:17] about that that perverted i'm just going
[1:21:19] to close here in a minute i don't want
[1:21:20] to hold us very long this evening
[1:21:22] i
[1:21:24] you know the world has that perverted
[1:21:26] idea of leadership
[1:21:27] of what real leadership is and they want
[1:21:30] this person and their remember brother
[1:21:31] branham said they're going to get it
[1:21:32] they want their superman they're going
[1:21:34] to get him
[1:21:35] it's going to be everything
[1:21:37] they want him to be
[1:21:39] you know
[1:21:42] they've got this perverted idea of
[1:21:43] leadership it's really interesting
[1:21:44] because
[1:21:45] brother branham told us he said everyone
[1:21:48] is following something
[1:21:50] all these people
[1:21:52] that want to act like they're leaders
[1:21:54] you know i i just think it out the lord
[1:21:56] you know the lord just gives you
[1:21:57] thoughts and you just start to meditate
[1:21:58] down a little bit and it just kind of
[1:22:00] branches off here and branches out there
[1:22:01] and he shows you little things and i
[1:22:02] thought about you know i don't deal with
[1:22:05] any of these things in particular but i
[1:22:06] know you know
[1:22:08] and i know brother matthews hit on these
[1:22:10] things before and praise the lord he has
[1:22:11] you know you talk about the tick tocks
[1:22:13] and the twitters and all these different
[1:22:14] things and i just thought about it what
[1:22:15] are they all obsessed with obsessed with
[1:22:17] they want to get more followers they
[1:22:18] want to get more followers and more
[1:22:20] followers and these people one and it
[1:22:22] was just like it's the same spirit
[1:22:24] brother brain i'm hammered
[1:22:26] when he had to tell the people about the
[1:22:28] the the president's wife and how she cut
[1:22:30] your hair one way and pretty soon the
[1:22:32] whole nation's caught up in it
[1:22:34] they all think they got an original idea
[1:22:36] but really they're just following
[1:22:38] they all think they're original and
[1:22:40] they're just following and they don't
[1:22:41] even know that that person that they
[1:22:43] were following that thought they were
[1:22:44] original was getting what they were
[1:22:46] following was the spirit of the devil
[1:22:49] and it's the same way today all these
[1:22:51] people on these social media platforms
[1:22:54] and everything trying to that's what
[1:22:55] they call them right as influencers
[1:22:58] trying to influence
[1:23:00] what that i want you to think about it
[1:23:01] next time you go to look at your tick
[1:23:03] tocks or your twitters and these
[1:23:04] influencers that are trying to tell you
[1:23:06] something they're being influenced by
[1:23:09] something
[1:23:10] they call themselves influencers
[1:23:13] but they're just a channel to influence
[1:23:16] you straight from the pit of hell
[1:23:21] they used to do it through tv
[1:23:23] i remember growing up and they on the tv
[1:23:25] shows one woman on the tv show would cut
[1:23:27] her hair a certain way pretty soon the
[1:23:29] whole country's cutting their hair that
[1:23:31] way
[1:23:31] same thing at brother branham's saying
[1:23:33] same thing in this day
[1:23:35] same spirits
[1:23:37] just different methods of operation
[1:23:40] it's time we matured as christians and
[1:23:42] realize the filth of that stuff
[1:23:45] realize what it is it's nothing but the
[1:23:49] devil
[1:23:51] try to use the devil's tools against him
[1:23:54] i think not
[1:23:55] just better to leave it alone
[1:23:57] i tell you what hey
[1:24:00] you you be convicted the way the lord
[1:24:01] convicts you i just tell you what the
[1:24:02] lord convicts me
[1:24:04] you know but that but that's what it is
[1:24:06] right they call themselves influencers
[1:24:09] they they they get all these millions of
[1:24:11] they call them followers
[1:24:13] and they think they're leaders and
[1:24:15] they're all they're doing is leading
[1:24:16] people straight down the pit of hell
[1:24:19] right on a one-way highway right there
[1:24:22] because everybody thinks that they've
[1:24:24] got these unique ideas oh look at the
[1:24:26] way i can do this and the way i can do
[1:24:28] this there's nothing new under the sun
[1:24:31] i mean goodness even i haven't even lord
[1:24:34] i'm only i'll be 38 this year
[1:24:37] i'm getting you know getting close to
[1:24:38] that 40 mark and i'm even amazed at how
[1:24:41] even since i've been alive fashions have
[1:24:43] rotated in circles already
[1:24:46] i mean when i was growing up when i was
[1:24:48] in high school i remember all the girls
[1:24:50] they started wearing the bell-bottom
[1:24:51] jeans again and i was like i know that
[1:24:53] was just like 30 years ago
[1:24:56] and if the lord were to tarry another 30
[1:24:58] years we'll see it again
[1:25:00] why because the devil doesn't have any
[1:25:02] new tricks
[1:25:04] he doesn't have anything new but the
[1:25:05] word of god is fresh and new to his
[1:25:07] people every day
[1:25:10] the lord can satisfy you the lord can
[1:25:13] bring into a place where you don't have
[1:25:14] no thirst for that garbage
[1:25:22] we hunger
[1:25:24] we try to satisfy things with worldly
[1:25:26] things
[1:25:27] we work ourselves to the bone in our
[1:25:29] natural jobs
[1:25:31] when the lord wants us
[1:25:33] to work for his kingdom
[1:25:35] what kind of kingdoms are we trying to
[1:25:36] build
[1:25:37] i want
[1:25:39] lord if the lord would help me my my
[1:25:41] prayer i i can't even remember where i
[1:25:42] heard this now but i i
[1:25:44] i heard someone say it somewhere but you
[1:25:47] may be able to find the quote it's not a
[1:25:48] brother branham quote specifically but
[1:25:49] it was just a really i love the thought
[1:25:51] of how
[1:25:52] if if the actions that you take every
[1:25:54] day ought to have eternal consequences
[1:25:58] when we do something
[1:26:00] what are we doing it for
[1:26:02] are we trying to progress the kingdom of
[1:26:04] god
[1:26:05] or are we trying to progress our own
[1:26:07] kingdom and that brought me right to the
[1:26:09] thought where brother branagh was
[1:26:10] telling the story of the man he said
[1:26:12] everything you talk about the man was
[1:26:13] hogs because he rode rose hogs
[1:26:16] he said everything you talk about was
[1:26:18] hogs and hogs this and hogs that and oh
[1:26:20] i got the hogs today and this over here
[1:26:23] he says there's more life than hogs
[1:26:28] and i've caught myself
[1:26:30] you get caught up in either politics or
[1:26:33] work or
[1:26:34] family matters or all these different
[1:26:36] things there's more to life than that
[1:26:40] life is jesus christ
[1:26:42] life is this word life is living for
[1:26:45] others
[1:26:47] you won't fulfill yourself building
[1:26:49] yourself a natural kingdom
[1:26:51] you will not fulfill yourself you will
[1:26:53] be empty
[1:26:54] i don't care how much education you get
[1:26:57] someone's going to be smarter than you
[1:27:00] i don't care how much money you get
[1:27:03] someone's going to have more than you
[1:27:06] who care how much wealth or favor
[1:27:08] whatever it is you can get naturally
[1:27:11] there's always going to be more and it
[1:27:12] will not fulfill
[1:27:16] specifically for you young people
[1:27:18] because that is the message
[1:27:19] that all of these influencers are
[1:27:21] spreading
[1:27:23] get more get more do this be this
[1:27:26] do this it's that same spirit of what i
[1:27:28] said that under armor free i will
[1:27:30] i will do this i will become this i will
[1:27:34] get this i will do this i will become
[1:27:37] this
[1:27:39] i want to be what he wants me to be
[1:27:42] i'm tired i'm tired of brother randy
[1:27:47] if i could say i'm tired of randall
[1:27:49] verton
[1:27:50] i want randall verton to be gone
[1:27:54] totally gone i'm tired of him
[1:27:56] i look in the mirror
[1:27:58] he's losing more hair
[1:28:02] and then the hair that's going away
[1:28:05] is turning gray on the beard
[1:28:07] you know
[1:28:08] and it just go you know
[1:28:10] you know you look at yourself and you
[1:28:12] know you're always your own worst critic
[1:28:14] even when it comes to the natural things
[1:28:15] you look at yourself and yep yep i knew
[1:28:17] that right i was two millimeters lower
[1:28:19] than the left one
[1:28:21] i'm lopsided
[1:28:22] you know and what is it because the
[1:28:24] devil's trying to get you to focus on
[1:28:25] all the natural things this body's about
[1:28:27] ready to be dissolved anyway
[1:28:29] it's in a current state of dissolving
[1:28:32] it's in a steady decline
[1:28:34] it is it's happening get used to it
[1:28:38] so quit trying to pamper it so perfectly
[1:28:42] we work we get so caught up in all these
[1:28:45] things oh i want to look a certain way i
[1:28:46] want to do this and i want to do that
[1:28:48] it's like lord spiritually let me look
[1:28:50] up let me look the way you want me to
[1:28:52] look
[1:28:53] lord when i can look in this mirror of
[1:28:55] your word let me see let me see your
[1:28:58] reflection shining in me
[1:29:01] your character your ideas
[1:29:04] i know these things are simple but this
[1:29:06] is the challenge of the hour because as
[1:29:08] we're remember we're going back to eden
[1:29:11] and what was the temptation and eden
[1:29:13] was i will
[1:29:15] because eve said i will get that
[1:29:17] knowledge
[1:29:18] i will understand these things i will
[1:29:21] what was he doing satan said you will be
[1:29:22] his gods knowing good and evil
[1:29:25] she didn't she didn't have the
[1:29:26] revelation she already was
[1:29:30] she already was
[1:29:32] see satan tries to give you and that's
[1:29:34] why it's so simple
[1:29:36] for god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:29:38] revealing himself in the same she didn't
[1:29:40] even realize
[1:29:41] you know
[1:29:42] i believe i believe
[1:29:44] maybe one of these things because you
[1:29:45] know the devil remember brother branham
[1:29:46] said it's going right back to that where
[1:29:48] we're going back to that showdown
[1:29:50] and that you know what the devil's gonna
[1:29:51] do if you if you this revelation this
[1:29:53] super secret revelation may be part of
[1:29:55] it i don't know i'm just saying this is
[1:29:56] just what the lord put on my heart this
[1:29:58] little revelation because that's one of
[1:29:59] the things that we fight in this message
[1:30:01] because we want to know more about god
[1:30:03] people hunger for it and so what do they
[1:30:05] do to start going off in all these
[1:30:06] little paths
[1:30:08] but the simplicity of the gospel said
[1:30:10] the devil comes to eve and says you'll
[1:30:12] know good and evil if you do this
[1:30:15] but you know what i believe the bride
[1:30:17] would have would will say when she's
[1:30:18] putting that same side she says i
[1:30:20] already do know good and evil
[1:30:22] to follow the word of god is good
[1:30:24] and to do anything contrary is evil
[1:30:28] it's so simple but she already knew good
[1:30:30] and evil but she reasoned herself right
[1:30:32] out of it brother brain i might you can
[1:30:35] look it up i don't remember the exact
[1:30:36] quote i just listened to it today though
[1:30:38] and brother branham talked about that
[1:30:40] experience in the garden he said he said
[1:30:41] that reasoning he said that struggle
[1:30:43] with reason is what brought all this
[1:30:45] stuff on in the first
[1:30:46] place and that's why i have to hit that
[1:30:49] so hard so many times i just feel it in
[1:30:52] unction because look at the world around
[1:30:54] us
[1:30:55] everything is reasoning
[1:30:57] believe the science
[1:30:59] believe that that's what you hear the
[1:31:01] mantra now brother branham warned us of
[1:31:03] that i i so love this message because
[1:31:06] we're seeing
[1:31:08] modern defense made clear by prophecy we
[1:31:10] are watching it come to pass people
[1:31:13] thought he was nuts
[1:31:15] if i can say i'm forgiving for saying
[1:31:16] that that way but that's just the way it
[1:31:17] is they thought he was insane
[1:31:20] science this and science that and
[1:31:21] science this and science that and you
[1:31:24] watch the news for a half hour
[1:31:27] i see it at work because they always had
[1:31:29] the tvs with news on her i hear
[1:31:31] different things that's all they hit
[1:31:33] science science science if you don't
[1:31:36] believe the science you've got to
[1:31:37] believe the science this and science
[1:31:39] inside they it's their god
[1:31:42] they're going to get their scientific
[1:31:43] superman
[1:31:45] they're leading right up we can see it
[1:31:47] why because we had a prophet who thus
[1:31:49] saith the lord told us these things
[1:31:50] would come to pass and we're watching it
[1:31:52] happen
[1:31:54] that's why i could say like brother
[1:31:56] brandon said you can't you can't tell me
[1:31:57] i've already seen too much now you can't
[1:31:59] you can't tell me otherwise now
[1:32:01] i've seen too much
[1:32:02] i have it's been revealed that's
[1:32:04] revelation right revelation faith is a
[1:32:07] revelation
[1:32:08] faith is sight
[1:32:10] spiritual sight
[1:32:12] that's how you see the spiritual things
[1:32:14] is by faith and faith can only be given
[1:32:16] by revelation
[1:32:19] lord help our unbelief lord help raise
[1:32:22] our faith lord give us a give us a
[1:32:24] higher portion of faith help us to have
[1:32:26] the faith to know that he's in total
[1:32:29] control we can lay these things aside
[1:32:31] not worry what tomorrow holds
[1:32:33] put it into his hands
[1:32:35] sanctify ourselves
[1:32:37] for each other's sake
[1:32:39] just like our lord told us
[1:32:42] not just for our own sakes although it
[1:32:43] is freed or sick too
[1:32:45] but for one another
[1:32:47] living one for another
[1:32:49] i hope that's okay let's just all stand
[1:32:51] i'm not gonna hold you any longer than
[1:32:52] that
[1:32:55] i
[1:33:02] i just want to issue that challenge to
[1:33:04] us all you know we're we're coming to
[1:33:06] that place i believe it i see it
[1:33:08] i truly do i i believe the lord
[1:33:11] is bringing us to these places you know
[1:33:13] he's bringing us closer and closer
[1:33:14] together
[1:33:15] all these trials that we're going
[1:33:17] through you know
[1:33:18] the different things that everybody's
[1:33:20] maybe fighting and trials and
[1:33:22] tribulations we're going through they
[1:33:23] just draw us closer
[1:33:24] they just draw us closer you know i i
[1:33:26] had i don't know about anybody else that
[1:33:28] was here on sunday night but i had a
[1:33:29] wonderful time when the power was out
[1:33:32] you know all the creature comforts that
[1:33:33] we get used to and you know what it was
[1:33:35] it was just like i thought i was just
[1:33:37] like man this is almost like a little
[1:33:38] preview of what the squeeze might be
[1:33:40] like when we're all hiding out in a
[1:33:41] house somewhere and still praising the
[1:33:43] lord with no power
[1:33:44] i don't know what it's going to be like
[1:33:46] but i just said lord
[1:33:47] lord we know we don't need all these
[1:33:49] natural things we just need the spirit
[1:33:50] of god the spirit of the living god the
[1:33:52] holy ghost the word
[1:33:55] and his living through his people
[1:33:58] amen
[1:34:07] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:34:08] prayer
[1:34:14] heavenly father
[1:34:18] lord we're just longing lord jesus
[1:34:21] for that day
[1:34:23] lord will we meet you in the arrow
[1:34:25] father
[1:34:30] lord the trials and tribulations that we
[1:34:32] go through
[1:34:35] lord they can't even begin to be
[1:34:36] compared lord with the glory that will
[1:34:37] be revealed in us
[1:34:41] lord these light afflictions
[1:34:45] lord and in the moment they seem so big
[1:34:50] just like jonah in the in the belly of
[1:34:52] the whale
[1:34:54] many times we look around and all we see
[1:34:56] is our
[1:34:57] situation our circumstance
[1:35:00] but lord we had a prophet who came
[1:35:03] and we have a word that declares
[1:35:07] that the word of god will overcome the
[1:35:09] devil
[1:35:11] any place
[1:35:12] any time and under any condition
[1:35:17] lord because
[1:35:19] you promised it to us lord jesus
[1:35:22] we're resting on the promises
[1:35:27] lord we can't rest on anything else lord
[1:35:28] you said heaven and earth would pass
[1:35:30] away but your word would never fail
[1:35:36] lord it's that it's that hope and that
[1:35:38] faith
[1:35:39] lord in a resurrection as we see loved
[1:35:41] ones go on
[1:35:45] lord as we see
[1:35:47] different ones that are
[1:35:48] that we love that may be astray in the
[1:35:50] world
[1:35:53] but lord we've sent the holy ghost after
[1:35:55] him lord
[1:35:58] lord we send our prayers after him
[1:36:00] father
[1:36:02] lord and even as we maybe spoke a little
[1:36:04] tonight lord we sanctify ourselves lord
[1:36:06] for their sakes
[1:36:10] lord so that there wouldn't be any
[1:36:11] hindrance in our lives
[1:36:13] nor that there wouldn't be any hindrance
[1:36:14] in the body of christ
[1:36:17] but lord that all the channels would be
[1:36:19] open lord for you to work through

[1:36:51] lord that you care for us father so much
[1:36:54] but lord you also want to see that we

[1:47:22] that god
[1:47:24] gave you
[1:47:25] eternal life and he just simply said it
[1:47:28] was freely given

[1:47:35] impart the life
[1:47:38] that you have in them the eternal life
[1:47:40] that you have
[1:47:43] pass it on
[1:47:45] amen we're especially this week
[1:47:48] keeping brother tim
[1:47:51] pruitt in the family in prayer
[1:47:55] sister karen has gone on to be with the
[1:47:58] lord and
[1:48:00] and
[1:48:01] she possessed that eternal life her
[1:48:04] spirit bore witness to it
[1:48:07] that there was something that lived
[1:48:08] inside her
[1:48:10] and she
[1:48:12] showed it every day by that
[1:48:14] just steady
[1:48:16] life
[1:48:17] that just lived a
[1:48:19] real servant to her husband and her
[1:48:22] children
[1:48:23] her grandchildren and to the church
[1:48:26] and now she's not in this realm anymore
[1:48:30] but the hope that lies within us
[1:48:34] is a hope for that other life
[1:48:36] that other world that the life that it's
[1:48:39] in us belongs
[1:48:41] there
[1:48:42] how many are realizing it don't belong
[1:48:44] here anymore
[1:48:46] amen
[1:48:48] so as our brother encouraged us tonight
[1:48:51] let's
[1:48:52] let that light shine
[1:48:55] let's share
[1:48:56] and give what we possess
[1:48:59] give it away
[1:49:01] amen it was freely given to us freely
[1:49:04] give
[1:49:05] i don't want to give people
[1:49:09] all the problems i have or
[1:49:11] all the doubts i have and all the mental
[1:49:14] battles i have that's not what i'm
[1:49:16] trying to share
[1:49:18] with the world
[1:49:19] i'm sharing the gift
[1:49:22] that god gave me
[1:49:24] the thing that's going to transport me
[1:49:26] from this world to the next
[1:49:29] so leave those things that
[1:49:32] are behind behind and press for that
[1:49:34] holler calling so let us pray tonight
[1:49:38] our father
[1:49:41] our hearts go out to our
[1:49:44] brother
[1:49:47] he's lost his queen
[1:49:52] the one that so adjourned with him
[1:49:57] from just a boy preacher to
[1:50:02] the ministry
[1:50:04] known
[1:50:07] around the world
[1:50:10] she stood there they ministered to
[1:50:13] thousands of souls
[1:50:17] how many youth were served
[1:50:21] and she was just a strength
[1:50:24] there all the time
[1:50:28] father a part of us has gone on
[1:50:33] and we know we have this comfort
[1:50:35] because you live
[1:50:37] we live also
[1:50:40] and lord we just ask that you comfort
[1:50:42] each one i know their comfort is in the
[1:50:45] fact that we'll meet again
[1:50:48] so we don't sorrow
[1:50:50] as the world sorrows
[1:50:52] we sorrow
[1:50:54] but we don't sorrow the way they sorrow
[1:50:56] without no hope
[1:51:00] and so father there's no tribute
[1:51:03] that could really be given
[1:51:07] to our sister and the part that she
[1:51:09] played in the universal body
[1:51:13] but father we'll see it that day when
[1:51:16] that
[1:51:17] crown is
[1:51:19] so full of jewels
[1:51:24] that that quiet simple life possess so
[1:51:27] much of you
[1:51:34] or we don't have words
[1:51:37] but what we do have father is our
[1:51:39] brother so gallantly preached
[1:51:42] we have the possession
[1:51:45] of eternal life and quickening power
[1:51:50] and father may we
[1:51:51] light that candle
[1:51:53] and set it on the hilltop
[1:51:56] may we share it may we be convinced
[1:52:00] so that we're concerned
[1:52:03] bless us this week father we pray
