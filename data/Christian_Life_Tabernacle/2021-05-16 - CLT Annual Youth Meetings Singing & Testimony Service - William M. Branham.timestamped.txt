[1:22:15] time the coming

[1:22:38] well my wife um said she really felt it
[1:22:41] on her heart to tell her
[1:22:43] tell a little testimony so i've learned
[1:22:46] you know if you get a godly wife and the
[1:22:48] holy spirit speaks to her well
[1:22:51] just lean on that sometimes so i'm gonna
[1:22:53] let her like my kids they didn't have a
[1:22:55] chance
[1:22:56] because you know they're a lot like me
[1:22:59] and so i knew what they were up to
[1:23:00] usually and if i didn't know what they
[1:23:01] were up to the holy spirit spoke to
[1:23:03] their mama
[1:23:04] and they just didn't ever have a chance
[1:23:07] so
[1:23:07] anyway go ahead sweetie so yeah this is
[1:23:10] way out of my comfort zone so
[1:23:12] bear with me but so um maybe this is for
[1:23:15] a sister
[1:23:16] i have no idea i really don't but i've
[1:23:18] learned to yield
[1:23:19] when god says do something so i was
[1:23:22] raised in a christian home i was raised
[1:23:24] in a message home
[1:23:26] both my parents came in well before i
[1:23:29] was born
[1:23:29] so that's all i knew i got saved when i
[1:23:32] was young i was baptized at eight
[1:23:34] but it was always this is what i was
[1:23:37] taught
[1:23:38] i do this because it's what my parents
[1:23:40] said never was
[1:23:41] mine until
[1:23:45] later when i was in my late teens
[1:23:48] about 19 i went to some youth meetings
[1:23:51] with some friends
[1:23:52] um they all went looking for boyfriends
[1:23:56] i was like well i need the holy ghost
[1:23:58] before i get a boyfriend so
[1:24:00] i'm going looking forward to
[1:24:07] sorry
[1:24:11] so anyway so i went with with the
[1:24:14] purpose of
[1:24:15] getting the holy ghost and i was
[1:24:16] determined not to leave until i got it
[1:24:19] and god gave it to me later that same
[1:24:22] year
[1:24:23] i got my boyfriend too so
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:28] glory
[1:24:31] so i guess my point in this is sisters
[1:24:34] just get the holy ghost
[1:24:36] god will send you the right man and you
[1:24:38] know almost 21 years later
[1:24:40] i have no regrets so god will send him
[1:24:43] to you just get the holy ghost first
[1:24:53] well my daughter told me that this is
[1:24:55] our theme song she's like well we gotta
[1:24:56] sing our thing sing our theme song i'm
[1:24:58] like
[1:24:59] what's our theme song and she said well
[1:25:02] it's
[1:25:02] it's this song how can it be and i think
[1:25:05] i'll read a quote from the church age
[1:25:07] book
[1:25:07] um i don't know somewhere in there
[1:25:10] around the bridge area and we just
[1:25:13] we just thank god that we've been
[1:25:16] justified
[1:25:18] you know as though you've never done it
[1:25:20] and the song says how can it be
[1:25:22] because if we think about it what god
[1:25:24] has done for us
[1:25:25] it shouldn't have happened but
[1:25:29] by his grace by his amazing love to us
[1:25:52] foreign
[1:25:54] [Music]
[1:25:56] i am guilty
[1:26:02] ashamed of what i've done
[1:26:06] what i've become these hands were dirty
[1:26:15] i'd dare not lift them up
[1:26:20] to the holy one
[1:26:22] [Music]
[1:26:29] you plead my course
[1:26:32] you ride my rose
[1:26:35] break my chains you
[1:26:40] overcome you
[1:26:42] gave your life to give me
[1:26:46] mine you say that i
[1:26:49] am free how can it be
[1:26:58] how can it be
[1:27:06] i've been hiding
[1:27:12] afraid i've let you down
[1:27:16] inside i doubt then you still
[1:27:20] love me
[1:27:25] but in your eyes there's only
[1:27:29] grace now
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:43] you break my trees
[1:27:46] you overcome you
[1:27:49] gave your life to give me
[1:27:54] mine you say that i
[1:27:57] am free how can
[1:28:00] it be
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:05] how can it be
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:13] now consider this since it is the blood
[1:28:15] of god it is perfect blood
[1:28:17] and if the perfect blood is loosing us
[1:28:19] from the power and bondage
[1:28:21] and defilement of sin then the losing is
[1:28:24] perfect and complete
[1:28:26] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:28:28] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:28:30] god's elect
[1:28:31] it is god that justify it who is he that
[1:28:34] condemneth
[1:28:35] it is christ that died there it is his
[1:28:38] death
[1:28:38] gave us the blood the blood has loosed
[1:28:41] us
[1:28:42] there is now no condemnation how can
[1:28:45] there be
[1:28:56] you can make me new
[1:29:00] from his death i will rise with you
[1:29:06] oh the grace reaching
[1:29:13] how can it be
[1:29:19] how can it bring
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:31] you break my chains
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:47] [Applause]
[1:29:48] how can it be
[1:29:54] how can it be
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:30:03] i was guilty
[1:30:09] ashamed of what i'd done
[1:30:13] what i'd become these hands were dirty
[1:30:22] but now i lift them up
[1:30:25] to the holy one
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:41] i was told to do two or three
[1:30:45] so when a brother invites you down and
[1:30:47] then he tells you to do two or three

[1:31:02] all of our glory
[1:31:03] i've been enjoying the singing and
[1:31:29] one day when heaven was filled with his
[1:31:33] praises
[1:31:36] one day when sin was as black as
[1:31:40] could be jesus
[1:31:43] came forth to be born of a virgin
[1:31:49] dwelt among men my example
[1:31:53] is he the word became flesh
[1:31:57] and the light shined among
[1:32:00] us his glory revealed
[1:32:04] living he loved me
[1:32:07] dying he saved me
[1:32:10] buried
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:23] one day he's coming a glorious day
[1:32:28] from glorious days
[1:32:38] one day they led him up calvary's
[1:32:42] mountain
[1:32:44] one day they nailed him to die on a tree
[1:32:50] suffering anguish
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:33:05] stretched out on a
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:20] my
[1:33:30] one day he's coming on glorious day
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:45] one day the grave could conceal him no
[1:33:49] longer
[1:33:51] one day the stone rolled away from the
[1:33:55] door
[1:33:57] then he arrows over
[1:34:00] death he had conquered
[1:34:03] now he's offended my lord evermore
[1:34:20] [Music]

[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:56] one day the trumpet will sound for his
[1:34:59] coming
[1:35:02] one day the skies with his glories
[1:35:05] will shine a wonderful day my beloved
[1:35:10] one ringing
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:40] glorious day o glorious day
[1:35:49] glorious day
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:22] okay
[1:36:26] so i i started singing this um song and
[1:36:30] it's just been a blessing to quite a few
[1:36:31] people
[1:36:33] particularly in the times of that thing
[1:36:36] which must not be named among us for the
[1:36:38] last 14 months
[1:36:42] um you know but people just
[1:36:46] you know they had a hard time and um
[1:36:49] and so this song you know
[1:36:53] i told our church i said you know it's
[1:36:56] good that we have these things sometimes
[1:36:58] because
[1:36:59] sometimes life just gets so easy and
[1:37:02] sometimes life just gets so good and
[1:37:06] it can tempt us to
[1:37:09] just get complacent maybe
[1:37:13] just feel like hey it's all right if god
[1:37:15] didn't come for another 10 years that's
[1:37:16] all right because you know
[1:37:19] stock market's been performing at about
[1:37:20] 12 percent every year for the last
[1:37:22] little while and the 401k looks all
[1:37:24] right
[1:37:26] the house is comfortable and things is
[1:37:27] going well but sometimes these
[1:37:30] things happen and we are reminded that
[1:37:33] this isn't
[1:37:34] our home sometimes that's good
[1:37:38] but sometimes things gets overwhelming
[1:37:40] and
[1:37:41] we just need to also a reminder that
[1:37:44] this isn't our home
[1:37:46] but there's one that we're going to and
[1:37:49] it's coming soon
[1:37:51] and so well we're almost home tonight
[1:37:55] i believe that with all my heart
[1:38:23] you disappointed
[1:38:27] are you desperate for hell
[1:38:33] you know what it's like to be tired and
[1:38:36] only a shell of yourself
[1:38:40] you start to believe
[1:38:45] you don't have what it takes
[1:38:50] and it's all you can do just to move
[1:38:53] much less finish
[1:38:55] the ring
[1:38:59] but don't forget
[1:39:04] what lies ahead
[1:39:09] almost home
[1:39:12] brother it won't be

[1:41:20] flesh and our bone are no longer between
[1:41:23] where we are right now and where we're

[2:28:48] i can't wait till these people leave

[2:29:09] and we've got everything we need to
[2:29:11] leave
[2:29:12] amen and we're just going to feast on it
[2:29:16] and feast on it till we get so
[2:29:19] spiritually that we just float
[2:29:23] right out here hey man
[2:29:26] you know i you know i've been kidding
[2:29:29] john all week because he's trying to
[2:29:31] put me in the grave all week
[2:29:34] but he don't know there ain't no grave
[2:29:36] that could hold this body down
[2:29:38] you know and so that's okay
[2:29:43] but i'm going to win one way or the
[2:29:45] other because the dead in christ shall
[2:29:46] rise first
[2:29:47] [Applause]
[2:29:49] so uh i'll tell them you're coming
[2:29:54] amen man and if he comes before you go
[2:29:57] i'll go with you
[2:29:58] okay man i'm looking for i'm looking
[2:30:00] forward to go with it
[2:30:01] do you realize what a wonderful time
[2:30:04] we had this evening i mean
[2:30:09] people somewhere are totally confused
[2:30:12] because they've heard english they've
[2:30:13] heard spanish they've heard french
[2:30:15] they've heard zim
[2:30:17] that's why he i don't know all the stuff
[2:30:19] they heard
[2:30:20] you know what i mean people sing and and
[2:30:22] and rejoicing
[2:30:24] and everything but you know jesus made
[2:30:26] one of the greatest statements that
[2:30:28] always stuck with me
[2:30:30] he said it's freely been given
[2:30:33] freely gift and he said if you've ever
[2:30:36] tasted of the good things of god you're
[2:30:40] obligated to share it with somebody else
[2:30:43] and and you know i know it's always hard
[2:30:47] for uh you know students
[2:30:51] and people that go to school because we
[2:30:53] have a lot of friends that
[2:30:55] love the lord and they do love the lord
[2:30:59] and they try to serve god the best way
[2:31:01] they can
[2:31:02] and we're not saying that there's not a
[2:31:04] place for them
[2:31:06] but this is a rapturing message
[2:31:10] this is more than a salvation message
[2:31:13] this is a message that's given to a
[2:31:16] people
[2:31:17] that are going to be taken up before
[2:31:20] judgment
[2:31:22] and and so it's it's so special
[2:31:25] and to think that god's blessed you
[2:31:28] enough
[2:31:29] to let you hear a message that's going
[2:31:32] to save you
[2:31:34] from the wrath and it's not god's
[2:31:37] wrath it's the wrath that the world's
[2:31:40] pouring out upon themselves
[2:31:42] they can't sustain the madness
[2:31:46] that they're going about they're losing
[2:31:48] their minds
[2:31:49] they're trying to make everything fit
[2:31:52] they're destroying the earth
[2:31:54] but you know we have one that looked
[2:31:57] down from heaven and put our name
[2:31:59] on a book before there ever was a star
[2:32:03] in the sky and he said before it gets
[2:32:05] that to that place
[2:32:07] i will not suffer my bride to go through
[2:32:10] that
[2:32:10] trouble and so the privilege
[2:32:14] that you have and i don't think there's
[2:32:17] any
[2:32:18] greater joy i've i've seen miracles
[2:32:22] i could go for hours seeing the things
[2:32:25] that i've seen
[2:32:26] the lord jesus do the miracles the
[2:32:30] the healings but there's been nothing
[2:32:33] that thrills my soul more than to see
[2:32:36] somebody cross the river of death
[2:32:39] from death to life and and go from sure
[2:32:43] destruction
[2:32:45] to eternal life and glory
[2:32:48] and there's nothing that will ever give
[2:32:50] you joy
[2:32:51] like sharing this message with somebody
[2:32:55] and having them receive it and so our
[2:32:58] whole weekend
[2:32:59] has been about making sure that
[2:33:02] we have the holy spirit that we have the
[2:33:05] spirit of the lord
[2:33:07] and we know the spirit of the lord is
[2:33:11] love for god is love
[2:33:14] god so loved the world that he gave his
[2:33:17] only begotten son
[2:33:19] he so loved you that he gave you his son
[2:33:23] and if that spirit that was in jesus
[2:33:26] christ dwells in you
[2:33:27] we know that he'll quicken your mortal
[2:33:30] body bring your bodies under subjection
[2:33:33] and aren't you thankful for that that
[2:33:35] you don't have to do it
[2:33:37] i i would i still struggle to die daily
[2:33:42] and i struggle to bring this body under
[2:33:44] subjection and
[2:33:46] to turn away the lies of the enemy
[2:33:49] that's a daily struggle but i am so glad
[2:33:52] that i have somebody
[2:33:53] that has me in the palm of his hands and
[2:33:56] that nothing can pluck me out
[2:33:58] and i think this weekend we've decided
[2:34:00] that we're going to go with
[2:34:02] them all the way we're going to pay the
[2:34:05] price
[2:34:06] we're not going to recant we're going to
[2:34:09] stand true
[2:34:10] our testimonies are going to shine we're
[2:34:13] going to trim
[2:34:14] our lamps but it doesn't
[2:34:17] do us any good if we can't find that
[2:34:20] last one
[2:34:28] he's out there somewhere
[2:34:31] he's out there somewhere now i think
[2:34:34] he's in dallas fort worth
[2:34:37] or she's in dallas fort worth
[2:34:40] and i think we ought to go find them we
[2:34:43] ought to go on the highways the byways
[2:34:45] we got to go over we're not ashamed
[2:34:47] [Music]
[2:34:48] we tell everybody that we know we pass
[2:34:50] out books we give out
[2:34:52] tapes we sit down we talk with them we
[2:34:55] open the bible with them
[2:34:56] at school if you know somebody's
[2:34:58] suffering you pray with them
[2:35:01] amen and somebody's going to know
[2:35:04] that jesus christ is alive that he's the
[2:35:07] same yesterday today and forever
[2:35:10] and his last manifestation on this earth
[2:35:13] is in his bride
[2:35:17] she's the last one that can bring
[2:35:21] the true lord jesus to this world
[2:35:27] think of how important you are thinking
[2:35:30] of
[2:35:30] what it is that you possess so
[2:35:34] quit listening to him because i'm sure
[2:35:36] he quit listening to you tonight
[2:35:40] satan went to try to find the loudest
[2:35:43] honky tonk he could to get away from
[2:35:45] what was going on here tonight
[2:35:48] but you want to know something we're
[2:35:49] going to chase him
[2:35:51] we're going to make melody in our heart
[2:35:53] we're in the grocery store we're going
[2:35:55] to sing
[2:35:56] when we're on the job we're going to
