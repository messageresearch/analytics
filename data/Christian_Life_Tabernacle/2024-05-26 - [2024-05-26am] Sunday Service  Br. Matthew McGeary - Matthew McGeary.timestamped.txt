[57:55] Christ's name
[57:57] amen hallelujah it's good to be in his
[58:00] presence if you have your Bible let's go
[58:01] ahead and turn to Ephesians chapter
[58:04] 1 and Jacob it's good to see
[58:07] you amen it's good to see each of our
[58:09] visitors and those that have come you
[58:12] brought Mom too hi Mom it's so good to
[58:15] see y'all Jacob's a a childhood friend
[58:18] that's come and and he has a wonderful
[58:20] testimony of what God's done in his life
[58:22] and I'm believing one day he'll he'll be
[58:24] able to stand and share that
[58:27] uh you know we're all sons of God and
[58:29] and God knows how to look out over our
[58:30] lives and keep us
[58:32] amen and we just want to maybe speak a
[58:35] little bit about that in Ephesians uh
[58:38] chapter uh one we're going to be reading
[58:41] uh verse
[58:44] five my isn't it good to good to be in
[58:46] the the presence of the Lord and just
[58:49] to we could be somewhere else today but
[58:52] that's right here we
[58:54] are I say it's the grace of
[58:59] God you might not feel like you got much
[59:01] to be happy about but you should be
[59:04] happy just because of where you are this
[59:06] morning you might have been struggling
[59:08] and battling a lot of things but you're
[59:11] here and if you're
[59:14] here that means something let's just
[59:17] read in our Bibles
[59:20] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse five would
[59:24] read like this
[59:26] having predestinated us unto the
[59:29] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[59:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[59:35] of his will so whose will was it and
[59:37] whose pleasure was it to do
[59:39] so it was
[59:41] his to the praise of the glory of his
[59:44] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[59:46] in the Beloved ain't that wonderful this
[59:49] isn't something that you have done but
[59:51] he made you the
[59:52] accepted not based on your works not
[59:55] based on your merits it's not based on
[59:56] how good you were but it's something
[59:58] that he did in whom we have Redemption
[1:00:01] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:00:03] sins according to the riches of his
[1:00:06] grace wherein he hath abounded towards
[1:00:09] us in all wisdom and Prudence having
[1:00:12] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:00:15] will now that's a profound thing right
[1:00:17] there the mystery of his will so God has
[1:00:20] a has a will but that
[1:00:23] will is a mystery un until it's revealed
[1:00:27] to you what his will is according to his
[1:00:30] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:00:33] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:00:35] fullness of times he might gather
[1:00:37] together in
[1:00:38] all in one in one all things in Christ
[1:00:42] both which were in heaven and which are
[1:00:44] in Earth even in him in whom also we
[1:00:48] have obtained an
[1:00:50] inheritance being predestinated
[1:00:53] according to the purpose of him who
[1:00:56] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:01:00] his own will notice that you've been
[1:01:03] predestinated and you have obtained an
[1:01:06] inheritance and there's nothing that can
[1:01:08] take that away from you you have an
[1:01:10] inheritance when the devil would try to
[1:01:12] Rob and he'd try to steal he'd try to
[1:01:14] Snuff out your life and try to bring you
[1:01:16] into situations that you thought you
[1:01:18] could never get out uh be reminded that
[1:01:21] you have been predestinated and you have
[1:01:23] an inheritance and there's nothing that
[1:01:25] the devil can
[1:01:27] do there's nothing the devil can do to
[1:01:29] rob you of your
[1:01:32] inheritance that we should that we
[1:01:35] should be to the praise of his glory who
[1:01:38] first trusted in Christ and whom ye also
[1:01:41] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:01:43] Truth The Gospel of your salvation in
[1:01:45] whom also after that ye believed you
[1:01:47] were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[1:01:50] Promise which is the earnest of our
[1:01:53] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[1:01:55] purchase possession unto the praise of
[1:01:58] his glory amen you may be seated I I
[1:02:02] just want to say we are certainly
[1:02:05] living in such a great hour uh we see
[1:02:10] the gross Darkness upon the people and
[1:02:13] you know uh great truth has come through
[1:02:16] a Vindicated prophet in the day that we
[1:02:18] are now living but when when man rejects
[1:02:21] truth the only thing left for them is to
[1:02:23] believe a lie and the scripture say that
[1:02:26] they would be damned for it and give it
[1:02:27] over to a strong delusion and certainly
[1:02:30] that is what we're seeing today we're
[1:02:31] seeing the manifestation of a nation in
[1:02:34] a world that has rejected truth and so
[1:02:37] the only thing that has been left for
[1:02:38] them is is reprobate minds they believe
[1:02:41] a lie and we're certainly starting to
[1:02:43] see the confusion and the things that
[1:02:45] have that have come out over the people
[1:02:47] where where people are just confused
[1:02:49] they don't even uh know who they are and
[1:02:52] and they they're starting to now it's
[1:02:54] unfortunate thing but you're starting to
[1:02:56] see a sickness and a thing develop in
[1:02:58] people where where they don't even
[1:03:00] recognize their gender they don't even
[1:03:02] recognize really uh uh what they belong
[1:03:04] to and and there's some people that even
[1:03:06] are starting to identify with animals
[1:03:08] and things like that you talk about a
[1:03:10] strange World we're living in but you
[1:03:13] know all of these are the symptoms and
[1:03:14] the repercussions of what happens when
[1:03:17] truth is presented and you re reject
[1:03:19] truth then you're going to uh uh believe
[1:03:22] a lie and you know as I was just
[1:03:23] thinking along these things and and I I
[1:03:26] I I start started to um uh think of the
[1:03:30] um the the the message that brother
[1:03:32] Brandon would preach spiritual Amnesia
[1:03:35] and as you think along these things you
[1:03:36] know there's conditions and illnesses
[1:03:39] that cause people to forget their
[1:03:41] identity you might see it and heard of
[1:03:43] it there's there's Alzheimer's and
[1:03:45] there's dementia and things and you know
[1:03:47] it's a sad thing when a loved one or
[1:03:49] somebody starts to forget who they are
[1:03:51] or who they're married to and you know
[1:03:54] you can imagine the the trouble that
[1:03:56] that one would go through uh having a
[1:03:58] spouse that they might have spent 30 40
[1:04:00] 50 years all their life and all of a
[1:04:01] sudden this person who who knows
[1:04:03] everything about them it starts to come
[1:04:05] into a condition where they don't even
[1:04:06] know their name they don't know who they
[1:04:08] are and and there's been things out
[1:04:10] there it's it's a little heartwarming
[1:04:12] things where you might see somebody who
[1:04:14] they've been married a long time but
[1:04:15] they forget and so what they're trying
[1:04:16] to do is they're trying to remind them
[1:04:18] they're trying to show a little picture
[1:04:20] they're trying to show something
[1:04:21] familiar they're trying to do anything
[1:04:23] that might for a moment connect that
[1:04:25] memory back to the relationship that
[1:04:27] they once
[1:04:29] had because there's been something that
[1:04:31] has come and and something that's
[1:04:32] developed in such a way where they're no
[1:04:34] longer attached because their memory has
[1:04:37] failed them so they can be looking at
[1:04:38] their spouse of 40 50 years who they've
[1:04:41] had uh four or five kids and grandkids
[1:04:44] and and all of a sudden through through
[1:04:46] a sickness through something in the mind
[1:04:48] they they now are looking at this person
[1:04:50] and they don't even know what they
[1:04:54] have but then for a moment every once in
[1:04:57] a while maybe something a picture or
[1:04:59] they might show some old wedding photos
[1:05:01] and then all of a sudden something
[1:05:02] something will Bridge the leak and
[1:05:04] there's a spark in their eyes they're
[1:05:05] like
[1:05:06] oh you're my
[1:05:09] husband and I say I I I I I pray that as
[1:05:12] we would look into the word of God a and
[1:05:14] we would start to look into the Bible
[1:05:16] you know we've all been shocked by sin
[1:05:18] and come into this world and we all have
[1:05:20] spiritual Amnesia not knowing who we are
[1:05:22] not knowing where we came from not
[1:05:24] knowing where we're going
[1:05:26] but God has sent a message to to to
[1:05:28] bring a spark that something you might
[1:05:30] look at like Oh Oh you mean that's where
[1:05:32] I was before the foundation of the world
[1:05:35] I was in
[1:05:37] him you mean you mean I don't belong to
[1:05:39] the things of this world in the way that
[1:05:41] I've been living and all these things uh
[1:05:44] that I've Gotten Trapped up in and all
[1:05:46] these things that I'm battling you mean
[1:05:47] that's not my identity no your identity
[1:05:49] is in the word your identity is in the
[1:05:51] scripture your identity is in Christ
[1:05:56] as our text would say having
[1:05:58] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:06:00] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:06:02] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:06:06] will so there is an identity or
[1:06:09] characteristics if I could say as the
[1:06:10] scripture uh would have said to to to uh
[1:06:13] Jesus would tell his disciples as the
[1:06:15] father sent me so I send you so if we're
[1:06:18] coming into a place as adopted Sons and
[1:06:20] Daughters of God there's going to be
[1:06:22] characteristics and things in our lives
[1:06:25] that are explain that we are like him we
[1:06:27] are a son we are a daughter of God and
[1:06:30] as the F he said as the father sent me
[1:06:32] so I sent you what was Christ he was the
[1:06:35] anointed
[1:06:36] one right he was the Messiah so what
[1:06:39] he's saying look if go if I was the
[1:06:41] anointed
[1:06:42] one the same way the father sent me I am
[1:06:45] going to send you that means you're
[1:06:47] going to be anointed the prophet of God
[1:06:49] said the bride is the anointed one for
[1:06:52] this
[1:06:53] day now that should be your IDE identity
[1:06:56] something you're wanting to press into
[1:06:57] and understand that there's a
[1:06:59] characteristic that the word of God is
[1:07:01] telling you that you are now the
[1:07:02] anointed one you are going to be the
[1:07:04] vessel you are going to be the body of
[1:07:06] the Lord the holy spirit is going to in
[1:07:08] Tabernacle your life and now you are
[1:07:11] going to do the Greater Works you're
[1:07:12] going to lay hands on the sick they're
[1:07:14] going to re uh recover you are going to
[1:07:16] be an overcomer you're going to overcome
[1:07:19] just like he
[1:07:22] overcame how did he overcome it is
[1:07:26] written it is written Satan get behind
[1:07:29] me man shall not live by bread alone oh
[1:07:32] aren't you thankful for it man shall not
[1:07:34] live by bread alone you know Satan's
[1:07:36] tried to develop a an economy where
[1:07:38] you're so dependent on everything that
[1:07:40] he has to
[1:07:42] offer you're depending on an education
[1:07:45] you're depending on a paycheck you're
[1:07:47] depending on everything this economy can
[1:07:50] offer you and so what do you try to do
[1:07:52] you try to you try to chase after the
[1:07:54] values that the the economy has
[1:07:56] developed because oh my the the economy
[1:07:58] they value in
[1:08:00] education so I better give all my time
[1:08:03] and all my
[1:08:05] attention to getting an education

[1:08:22] drive around town and let people know
[1:08:24] I'm successful
[1:08:27] and if we're not careful we're letting I
[1:08:29] love what brother Paul was preaching on
[1:08:30] about your value if we're not careful we
[1:08:33] start to let our economy and the society
[1:08:36] around us tell us what's valuable tell
[1:08:38] us what we're
[1:08:40] worth you're you're worth $9 an hour I'm
[1:08:43] worth $9 an hour that's my
[1:08:46] value and some people they they their
[1:08:49] whole
[1:08:51] self-esteem their whole countenance and
[1:08:54] everything through lives on what the the
[1:08:56] recognition that this world and this
[1:08:58] economy can
[1:09:00] offer that's why social media nowadays
[1:09:03] is such an illness that people are
[1:09:05] always being sprayed with all of these
[1:09:07] ideas and all these pictures of and all
[1:09:09] these lavish things and so everybody
[1:09:12] wants to make a hamburger when they're
[1:09:13] out to eat and and do all the
[1:09:15] photoshopping and like look at the
[1:09:17] Burger I ate best burger in the
[1:09:21] world yeah well you know ain't going to
[1:09:24] be much of a Burger in a little
[1:09:29] bit we put value on something that's
[1:09:32] turning into
[1:09:34] waste I got news for you this whole
[1:09:38] world is going to
[1:09:41] burn that might be shocking but we are
[1:09:44] putting all of our time all of our
[1:09:46] effort all of our value and trying to
[1:09:48] get worldly Goods that I want you to
[1:09:50] know all this is going to burn
[1:09:56] I'm afraid some of us have gotten too
[1:09:58] caught up in what the economy can
[1:10:00] offer you know I I was thinking about
[1:10:03] this I was looking over some things and
[1:10:05] I got to thinking about you know some of
[1:10:07] my brothers and sisters I I'll just
[1:10:09] leave this in the vag and you know I'm
[1:10:11] talking about but boy they they really
[1:10:12] know how to pray they really know how to
[1:10:14] enter in they really know how to to to
[1:10:17] to just just to break through into the
[1:10:18] presence of God and you see some of them
[1:10:20] Believers get together and my they start
[1:10:22] to pray and they'll bring down an
[1:10:24] atmosphere of prayer if you were to walk
[1:10:26] in and felt like you were all beat up
[1:10:28] you walked into that church and
[1:10:29] everybody praying in the presence of God
[1:10:31] in there you just fall right down on
[1:10:33] your knees you get to pray and I've seen
[1:10:35] kids four five six eight years old in
[1:10:37] the spirit of prayer everybody crying
[1:10:39] out to God and the spirit moving through
[1:10:41] there and you know in that Nation guess
[1:10:43] what their average salary is a year
[1:10:51] $449 you know what they're not putting
[1:10:53] their value on their economy
[1:10:56] but when they heard a message that
[1:10:58] you're a predestinated Son of God come
[1:11:01] out of the darkness come out of the
[1:11:03] Gloom that's all around look they didn't
[1:11:05] have to to weigh through all of the
[1:11:06] Comforts of Lady Osa they didn't have to
[1:11:09] weigh through uh making a six figures a
[1:11:12] year and fancy cars and all this things
[1:11:14] that's a lot of our struggle is lady oia
[1:11:16] because all these things that bombard us
[1:11:18] but you let a simple humble believer
[1:11:21] with with a fat roof and a dirt floor
[1:11:22] over their head and a predestinated seat
[1:11:24] of God hear the message of the hour they
[1:11:26] ain't worried about no economy they're
[1:11:29] rejoicing they got a smile on their face
[1:11:31] I'm a Child of God I'm the Bride of
[1:11:34] Jesus Christ I'm an heir of all things
[1:11:37] why are they happy because they know who
[1:11:39] they are they're not depending on the
[1:11:41] Congo they're not depending on the
[1:11:43] United States they're not depending on
[1:11:45] an annual salary they're not depending
[1:11:47] on how nice their car is or how nice
[1:11:50] their houses they're depending on one
[1:11:52] thing man shall not live by bread alone
[1:11:55] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:11:57] the mouth of God if he said I'm a Son of
[1:11:59] God I'm a Son of God if he said I'm an
[1:12:02] overcomer I'm an overcomer if he said
[1:12:04] I'll put hell under my feet I'm going to
[1:12:06] put hell under my feet I'm not looking
[1:12:08] at my ability I'm looking at what he
[1:12:11] said Hallelujah I am a
[1:12:14] predestinated son of almighty
[1:12:18] God that's my
[1:12:23] inheritance it belongs to
[1:12:27] me no devil in hell can take it
[1:12:31] away but we got a big battle going on up
[1:12:33] in here in our
[1:12:36] mind can you get me some water
[1:12:40] please we got a big battle going on in
[1:12:43] our
[1:12:45] mind who am
[1:12:48] I what's my
[1:12:50] identity what what am I even doing
[1:12:54] here a lot of times just look at your
[1:12:56] life look at the things you're chasing
[1:12:57] look at your
[1:12:58] desires look at how you let off the
[1:13:02] pressure it'll tell you tell you what
[1:13:04] you think we were fellowshipping a
[1:13:06] little long how the prophet of God said
[1:13:08] that that that Jesus didn't complete
[1:13:10] everything in his Earthly Ministry so
[1:13:13] now he works in and thank you too that
[1:13:15] means we can go a little
[1:13:16] longer so now he works in and through
[1:13:19] the bride she knows that for it was not
[1:13:21] yet time for him to do certain things
[1:13:22] that he must now do but he will now
[1:13:26] fulfill through the bride that work
[1:13:28] which he left for this specific
[1:13:31] time you got work to
[1:13:34] do and it ain't N9
[1:13:37] to5 it ain't flipping burgers at
[1:13:40] McDonald's don't knock it I worked
[1:13:43] there you know they actually pay pretty
[1:13:46] good good place to
[1:13:51] work but you're called to be a child of
[1:13:53] God on the job site
[1:13:55] that's right what is your
[1:13:58] occupation your occupation isn't your
[1:14:03] identity who are you well I'm a I'm a
[1:14:06] stone Mason what are you I'm an arbest
[1:14:09] what do you do for living I well you
[1:14:11] know what I do for a living I give
[1:14:13] praise to the almighty God what do I do
[1:14:16] do for a living I honor the word of God
[1:14:19] what do I do for you know I apply the
[1:14:21] token what do I do for living I don't
[1:14:24] live by bread alone but I live by every
[1:14:26] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:14:28] God that's what you do for a living we
[1:14:31] need to start living for the message we
[1:14:33] need to start living for the word we
[1:14:34] need to start living for him and stop
[1:14:36] living for this economy and the society
[1:14:39] around us for that what they esteem
[1:14:40] valuable now we we know that eternal
[1:14:43] life is living for others but how can
[1:14:45] you live for others when you ain't
[1:14:46] living for him how can you live for
[1:14:48] others when he's not living in you yeah
[1:14:51] you might be able to Pat yourself on the
[1:14:52] back while I went to the soup kitchen
[1:14:55] and I went to the shelter and I did all
[1:14:56] this and that but what about your
[1:14:58] private life sir what about the things
[1:15:00] you're feeding on what what are you
[1:15:02] using to let off the pressure and let
[1:15:03] off the steam what are the vices what
[1:15:05] are the demons that you're struggling
[1:15:06] with what are the things that you're
[1:15:08] facing God has a promise for you and an
[1:15:12] inheritance that if the spiritual
[1:15:14] Amnesia can just break for a moment oh
[1:15:17] and you can start to recognize who you
[1:15:19] really
[1:15:20] are that you're a Son of God you can be
[1:15:24] born again
[1:15:25] and the same life that was in Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ can come back upon you and you
[1:15:30] can be
[1:15:32] changed become a new creature in Jesus
[1:15:34] Christ old things pass away as the
[1:15:37] scripture would say but as many as
[1:15:39] received him to them he gave power to
[1:15:41] become sons of God even to them that
[1:15:43] believe on his
[1:15:44] name power to
[1:15:47] believe all the potential is
[1:15:50] there you know everything is in there
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:53] now you're not waiting for something
[1:15:55] outside to
[1:15:57] come but everything for you to be an
[1:16:00] overcomer everything for you to be that
[1:16:02] Son of
[1:16:04] God that predestinated seed is already
[1:16:08] in you
[1:16:10] now you mean when I was out in the drug
[1:16:13] houses there was a predestinated seat
[1:16:15] there you mean when I was laid out on
[1:16:17] the bed and all these things happened
[1:16:19] the predestinated seed was laying there
[1:16:22] you mean when I when I ran from God and
[1:16:24] I ran as hard as I can go there was a
[1:16:26] predestinated seat of God on the inside
[1:16:29] of
[1:16:30] you and no matter how much the devil
[1:16:33] would try to Snuff your life out there
[1:16:34] was nothing he could do because the Holy
[1:16:37] Spirit was brooding over your
[1:16:39] life he was watching out over
[1:16:42] you he was protecting you he was keeping
[1:16:46] you because there was something in there
[1:16:49] that didn't come from the
[1:16:51] Earthly it didn't come from the natural
[1:16:53] it didn't come from your M or your daddy
[1:16:55] but it came from the very Mind Of God
[1:16:58] that you were in him before he even
[1:17:00] founded the
[1:17:07] world oh that sounds pretty
[1:17:10] valuable and all of the potentials for
[1:17:13] you to be what God called you to be is
[1:17:15] already
[1:17:17] there but there has to come
[1:17:20] something I say where were
[1:17:23] you when the sons of God shouted for
[1:17:27] Joy there has to come
[1:17:30] something to break the spiritual
[1:17:34] Amnesia you think you're an alcoholic
[1:17:37] you you think you're you're you're
[1:17:39] addicted to pornography you you you
[1:17:41] think all these things you say well I
[1:17:43] don't think I know because I can't I
[1:17:45] can't break myself from it I understand
[1:17:48] that you have vices and there's things
[1:17:50] that that are controlling your life but
[1:17:52] that's not who you are that is not your
[1:17:55] identity that's something the flesh has
[1:17:57] taken to but there's a predestinated
[1:17:59] seat of God on the inside of you and
[1:18:02] there's the only thing it wants is the
[1:18:04] word just give me the word just give me
[1:18:07] the word just give me the word and it's
[1:18:09] the unadulterated word of the hour when
[1:18:12] it strikes that predestinated
[1:18:15] seed watch out watch out devil preacher
[1:18:20] what are you talk I know what I'm
[1:18:21] talking about I once was blind
[1:18:27] Hallelujah I once was blind what do you
[1:18:30] mean you you've had good eyesight your
[1:18:32] whole life oh
[1:18:33] no no there was a time in my life the
[1:18:37] only thing I could see was the
[1:18:39] circumstances around me the only thing I
[1:18:42] could do was grab for a bottle and smoke
[1:18:44] some of this or that the only thing I
[1:18:46] can do you brother Matthew growing up in
[1:18:48] the message

[1:19:02] seed and I finally got to a place I said
[1:19:05] God I need your
[1:19:09] help oh that's all he was waiting
[1:19:12] for because there's a b a scripture that
[1:19:15] says if you call on the name of the
[1:19:18] Lord you shall be saved if there's
[1:19:21] somebody here that needs saving this

[1:26:29] god in the

[1:26:34] predestinated seed of
[1:26:36] God being
[1:26:39] germinated oh the face of God starts to
[1:26:41] shine upon your
[1:26:43] life when the face of God starts to
[1:26:46] shine upon your life things start to
[1:26:48] happen changes start to
[1:26:51] happen things start to Fall Away things
[1:26:53] you thought you would never be delivered
[1:26:58] from I remember one time I was traveling
[1:27:00] I was over at a brother's
[1:27:03] house he had two dogs out there playing
[1:27:05] around and the older dog was quite a bit
[1:27:09] smaller than the younger
[1:27:11] one well
[1:27:13] that that little dog you know was his
[1:27:15] older he just yip yip yip yep and Chase
[1:27:19] that big old like some type of bull
[1:27:22] mastiff or something like that
[1:27:24] I'm like
[1:27:27] man how does this work he's like well
[1:27:31] he's
[1:27:32] older and he's
[1:27:35] actually I brought the other one home
[1:27:37] when he was a
[1:27:38] puppy so this one's always kept him in
[1:27:42] order and so that dog doesn't realize
[1:27:45] he's bigger than
[1:27:49] him so this thing that didn't have the
[1:27:52] power over this
[1:27:55] dog but this dog didn't really know who
[1:27:59] it was or what it
[1:28:02] was and it was just about the time that
[1:28:05] he said
[1:28:06] that that puppy started to realize wait
[1:28:09] a
[1:28:11] second I'm bigger than
[1:28:14] you and just in a Fell Swoop that little
[1:28:17] puppy picked up that older dog and
[1:28:19] slammed it on the ground and pinned it
[1:28:22] and said you know what I'm
[1:28:25] tired you've been chasing me around long
[1:28:28] enough you've been yipping at me and
[1:28:30] yapping at me and telling me I'll never
[1:28:32] be an overcomer that I'll never make it
[1:28:35] that I'll never be delivered you're just
[1:28:37] going to go through the same Cycles over
[1:28:39] and over and over you're never going to
[1:28:41] get delivered you'll really never have
[1:28:43] the Holy Ghost and power and dominion
[1:28:45] over your vessel you're just going to
[1:28:47] have fish hooks in your elbow till you
[1:28:48] die you'll never get total deliverance
[1:28:50] and that dog one time finally realized
[1:28:52] you know what I'm sick and tired of you
[1:28:55] trying to boss me around and tell me I'm
[1:28:58] not a son of God he picked that other
[1:29:00] dog and slammed it down and put his foot
[1:29:02] on his neck I think it's tie time for
[1:29:04] the bride of Christ to tell that Old

[1:29:40] Authority by the Holy
[1:29:42] [Music]
[1:29:45] Ghost now remember this Christ in the
[1:29:48] true church is a continuation of the
[1:29:50] book of
[1:29:51] Acts Hallelujah amen what book of Acts
[1:29:55] are you talking about brother Matthew
[1:29:58] I'm talking about the one where blind
[1:29:59] eyes were open where when people lied in
[1:30:02] the presence of the Holy Ghost they Dro
[1:30:05] dead we got some fronters we got some
[1:30:07] fakers we got some people that are
[1:30:08] trying to be what they're
[1:30:10] not brother Brandon said I long for the
[1:30:13] day when sin's called out at the door I
[1:30:15] say we ought to created such an
[1:30:16] atmosphere in here when the sinner comes
[1:30:18] in and say you know what I want some of
[1:30:19] what they
[1:30:22] got right I don't know have we lost our
[1:30:27] identification have we stopped longing
[1:30:29] for the
[1:30:31] Supernatural Well brother Matthew you
[1:30:33] know we're in the intelligence
[1:30:35] now nothing's manifesting in the
[1:30:38] supernat in the in the natural realm oh
[1:30:40] really tell Jesus
[1:30:43] that when all the Sadducees and
[1:30:45] Pharisees came away who is this man that
[1:30:49] can forgive
[1:30:51] sin you know the scripture says
[1:30:53] whosoever sends you remit they are
[1:30:54] remitted and whosoever they retain are
[1:30:57] retain was he lying or telling the truth
[1:31:00] the problem is is do we believe
[1:31:03] it do you believe it he said
[1:31:07] it they all they all scoffed at him and
[1:31:10] say man who's this guy that that could
[1:31:12] that says he could forgive sins he goes
[1:31:14] is it
[1:31:16] harder to say thy sins are
[1:31:19] forgiven or take up thy bed and walk
[1:31:23] Hallelujah huah I say the same Jesus is
[1:31:26] here this
[1:31:27] morning thy sins are forgiven you you
[1:31:30] don't have to lay on the bed of
[1:31:32] Affliction anymore Rise Up in Jesus
[1:31:35] Christ name and
[1:31:37] walk
[1:31:39] hallelujah thank you Lord but the Book
[1:31:41] of Revelation shows how the Antichrist
[1:31:43] Spirit would come into the church and
[1:31:45] defile it making it lukewarm and formal
[1:31:48] and
[1:31:49] Powerless what's he trying to
[1:31:51] do defile the church making lukewarm
[1:31:54] formal and
[1:31:56] Powerless it exposes
[1:31:58] Satan revealing his Works attempted
[1:32:01] destruction of God's people and the
[1:32:02] discrediting of God's
[1:32:04] word right down to the time he is cast
[1:32:07] in the Lake of Fire if I can get to
[1:32:08] touch more on my
[1:32:09] monitors he fights that he cannot stand
[1:32:13] it he knows that if the people get the
[1:32:17] true revelation of the true church and
[1:32:19] what she is what she stands for
[1:32:24] and that she can do the greater work she
[1:32:26] will be an invincible
[1:32:28] Army do you believe
[1:32:31] it you are an invincible
[1:32:36] Army you are an invincible
[1:32:39] Army do you believe it you've been given
[1:32:43] power to become all the potential is
[1:32:47] there it's about time we start talking
[1:32:51] like it it's about time we start living
[1:32:56] like it it's about time we start
[1:32:59] expecting
[1:33:00] it you know you get what you
[1:33:04] expect she will be an invincible Army if
[1:33:07] they get a true revelation of the two
[1:33:09] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:33:10] Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:33:13] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:33:15] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:33:21] her Satan will be
[1:33:25] powerless before
[1:33:28] her when when will that
[1:33:31] happen
[1:33:34] when
[1:33:36] when when is that going to
[1:33:39] happen
[1:33:41] when now ye are
[1:33:44] what
[1:33:46] Hallelujah now you are an invincible
[1:33:49] Army
[1:33:50] now another book of Acts is springing
[1:33:53] forth
[1:33:54] now I'm not waiting for something to
[1:33:57] come
[1:34:00] now the question is it's already been
[1:34:06] spoken the word has already been
[1:34:09] spoken now it's becoming material in you
[1:34:13] the seed's already there waiting for you
[1:34:16] to say amen amen amen I am the bride I
[1:34:21] am an invincible Army I can do all
[1:34:24] things I can do Greater Works
[1:34:26] amen then if you believe
[1:34:30] it see that's what you when you get into
[1:34:33] adoption oh when you get into adoption
[1:34:36] you are always a
[1:34:40] son differing no no different from a
[1:34:43] servant but Lord of
[1:34:46] all so all of the inheritance is the son
[1:34:50] but there has to come a dispensation or
[1:34:53] a change of dispensation where he's no
[1:34:56] longer just under tutors and Governor
[1:34:58] but now the tutor the Holy Ghost himself
[1:35:00] is now in the
[1:35:03] son his word becomes the same as the
[1:35:08] father I want to ask
[1:35:10] you the prophet said we're now living in
[1:35:13] the dispensation of
[1:35:15] adoption what are we waiting
[1:35:18] for what are you waiting for to be
[1:35:22] adopted God quiet that's
[1:35:28] good maybe he's waiting on
[1:35:31] you to realize who you really are and
[1:35:37] that you can do the great you want to
[1:35:38] know why you can do the Greater
[1:35:42] Works why can you do the Greater Works
[1:35:46] because he said
[1:35:48] so now if I tell you to come over to my
[1:35:51] house and I got a big tablesp bread full
[1:35:54] and I got the grapes and and I got the
[1:35:57] strawberries and the raspberries and and
[1:35:59] the almonds and and the honey and and
[1:36:01] the cheeses and oh you know the the the
[1:36:04] regano and and all the kinds of and it's
[1:36:08] all laid out there and it's a big spread
[1:36:10] and I just tell you hey come on over you
[1:36:12] can have whatever you
[1:36:14] want just go ahead and and kick your
[1:36:16] feet up on the table don't do that come
[1:36:19] in and make yourself at
[1:36:22] home come back around brother
[1:36:26] Ben why are you still sitting on the
[1:36:28] porch well you you told me to come over
[1:36:30] and we could have some fellowship I know
[1:36:32] but I told you to come in and and and
[1:36:35] and I have all this stuff made for you I
[1:36:38] I know thank you for having me over no
[1:36:40] are you not hearing me I said come in
[1:36:43] yeah I'm here brother Matthew I'm here
[1:36:46] do you not see the front
[1:36:49] door that's a lot of the problem a lot
[1:36:51] of us in our relationship with the Lord
[1:36:53] what did he say everybody lives in a
[1:36:55] three-bedroom house everybody wants to
[1:36:57] stay in the front of the house and but
[1:36:59] nobody wants to go back and make let
[1:37:01] them be your
[1:37:02] lord where he has complete control of
[1:37:05] your thoughts and your thinking and you
[1:37:07] become a bride impregnated with the word
[1:37:10] and now you're bringing forth the word
[1:37:11] you're bringing forth the children of
[1:37:12] the word you're bringing forth the fruit
[1:37:14] of the word not my thinking not my will
[1:37:16] Lord but thy
[1:37:21] will this is the the season of
[1:37:24] adoption you stand right now because the
[1:37:28] season of adoption brings forth the
[1:37:30] fullness of time which is the
[1:37:31] resurrection of the Dead
[1:37:33] Saints you know that's all waiting on
[1:37:37] you to recognize who you
[1:37:41] are to recognize what God has called you
[1:37:45] to now now don't take that in the
[1:37:48] negative because God sent a message to
[1:37:51] chase away the spiritual amnesia yeah
[1:37:54] the prophet of God said as long as you
[1:37:56] still love the world no matter how much
[1:37:58] you confess to be up here you're not up
[1:38:00] here you're down there he that loves the
[1:38:03] world or the things of the world the
[1:38:05] love of God hasn't entered in
[1:38:07] yet but when you raise above that to the
[1:38:11] Heavenly things then set your affections
[1:38:12] on things above because ye are risen
[1:38:15] with Christ and now seated in Heavenly
[1:38:19] places now before we move a little bit
[1:38:21] further that's where you belong amen you
[1:38:24] belong living in Heavenly places flying
[1:38:27] above all the cares of the world not
[1:38:31] allowing all these political things and
[1:38:33] all these agendas and politics and oh my
[1:38:36] I mean there some people's lives are
[1:38:38] going to be ruined whoever's elected
[1:38:41] next I mean there's people I mean
[1:38:43] they're like man if that happens I'm
[1:38:46] just going to move out of the United
[1:38:48] States I I'm I'm GNA sell my house I'm
[1:38:50] gonna I'm gonna quit my job and I'm
[1:38:52] gonna I'm I'm just going to I'm just
[1:38:54] going to yeah that's what I'm going to
[1:38:55] do yeah none of them did
[1:38:59] it but but their their whole life oh
[1:39:01] wouldn't it be
[1:39:03] nice to be seated in Heavenly places
[1:39:06] where you're walking with Jehovah and
[1:39:09] you've entered in behind the veil and
[1:39:11] the veil has dropped down behind you and
[1:39:14] you're walking with
[1:39:15] Jehovah you're walking with him and
[1:39:18] Jehovah saying hey did you hear what's
[1:39:20] going out in the world no Lord tell me
[1:39:21] all about it
[1:39:24] oh my it might have been recorded 50 60
[1:39:26] years ago what you're walking with him
[1:39:29] Hallelujah you've received a message the
[1:39:31] voice of God you're walking with
[1:39:34] him Faith come by hearing and hearing
[1:39:37] the word of God now just trying to
[1:39:39] progress somehow in this message I was
[1:39:42] just listening to spiritual Amnesia a
[1:39:44] little bit and the prophet of God would
[1:39:45] start talking about how Nebuchadnezzar
[1:39:48] you know he he started to lift himself
[1:39:50] up and he exalted himself and God God
[1:39:52] let him
[1:39:54] uh get to a place because he exalted
[1:39:55] himself that he thought he was an
[1:39:58] animal he forgot he was a human
[1:40:01] being and he starts to talk about how
[1:40:04] Israel I believe it's in in in uh Ezra
[1:40:08] where it starts to talk about Israel he
[1:40:11] says you know I found you when you were
[1:40:14] when you were when you were left alone
[1:40:16] in a field and you were polluted in your
[1:40:18] own blood and I came along and I picked
[1:40:21] you up and I washed you and I clinged
[1:40:23] you and I clothed you and I put Jewels
[1:40:25] upon you and I made you the great woman
[1:40:27] you are
[1:40:30] today and then the scripture says but
[1:40:32] you trusted in your own
[1:40:35] Beauty see she forgot and Nebuchadnezzar
[1:40:40] forgot it was God who gave them what
[1:40:43] they had they had come into a place of
[1:40:47] Amnesia where they got lifted up and he
[1:40:49] said oh that's exactly what the church
[1:40:51] world has done he that it's so easy
[1:40:54] today we forget sometimes what the
[1:40:57] Christian church is we act like the
[1:40:59] world that shows that we got spiritual
[1:41:02] Amnesia because that you don't act like
[1:41:05] a Christian you act like the world you
[1:41:09] receive the heart of the world and it
[1:41:11] causes this so we're dealing with
[1:41:13] spiritual amnesia for a
[1:41:16] moment there's a condition that comes
[1:41:18] upon the believer where you forget who
[1:41:21] you are where you're came
[1:41:24] from or what even brought you this for
[1:41:26] could you imagine if this church forgot
[1:41:29] what got us here we start to forget the
[1:41:32] grace we start to forget the mercy we
[1:41:33] start to forget the sacrifice and we
[1:41:36] start to to to put emphasis on our
[1:41:39] efforts and who we are and what we've
[1:41:40] accomplished look we got to are you
[1:41:42] kidding me everything we have is because
[1:41:45] the grace of
[1:41:46] God everything I have is because of the
[1:41:49] grace I haven't merited one thing it's
[1:41:52] all been
[1:41:55] Grace I can't point to anything that
[1:41:57] I've done I couldn't save myself I
[1:42:00] couldn't help myself and when I needed
[1:42:02] help I called on the name of the Lord
[1:42:04] and he saved
[1:42:07] me that's why we can have Grace for
[1:42:09] other
[1:42:10] people that's why we can have Grace for
[1:42:13] the Sinners and Grace for any of those
[1:42:15] out there because it's all
[1:42:17] Grace oh if it wasn't the love of God
[1:42:19] where would we be
[1:42:23] amen then that which was freely
[1:42:26] given freely
[1:42:29] give so just in laying a little
[1:42:31] Foundation here as we begin our message
[1:42:34] prophet of God would say in spiritual
[1:42:36] Amnesia don't worry we'll try to not be
[1:42:39] too
[1:42:41] long paragraph 37 he says now this
[1:42:44] Amnesia we're
[1:42:47] told will cause you to be in a place
[1:42:49] where you cannot identify yourself
[1:42:53] now it's an unusual thing it don't
[1:42:55] happen too often but the cause is
[1:42:57] shock it's somebody that don't even know
[1:43:00] who they are you find it in war
[1:43:03] sometimes a soldier gets it sometimes
[1:43:05] people get it another thing causes it
[1:43:07] worry worry will cause
[1:43:10] it worry has no virtue in it at all just
[1:43:13] skip worrying except Faith another thing
[1:43:15] that'll that paragraph 41 another thing
[1:43:18] that causes it among people it's getting
[1:43:21] between two opinions
[1:43:23] that'll cause Amnesia and it gets you to
[1:43:25] a place where you actually what you've
[1:43:27] done you've lost your
[1:43:30] reasons you've lost your mind you can't
[1:43:34] make you don't know who you are you
[1:43:36] can't identify
[1:43:38] yourself worry will cause
[1:43:41] Amnesia when you keep worrying about
[1:43:43] that prodal son or that prodical
[1:43:46] daughter it'll cause you Amnesia and
[1:43:49] you'll start dwelling on the wha
[1:43:51] ifs well well what if this happens what
[1:43:54] if they get in a car wreck what what
[1:43:56] happens if I if if if if they don't get
[1:43:58] delivered what what if this happens what
[1:44:00] if that happens and all of a sudden that
[1:44:03] worry worry will get you between two
[1:44:06] opinions
[1:44:07] too now all of a sudden you're like well
[1:44:09] I don't I don't know I mean he the Lord
[1:44:11] said I'm Healed but you know I'm still
[1:44:13] sick and and and you know it's been so
[1:44:17] long and the doctors say this is going
[1:44:18] to happen and that's going to and if
[1:44:20] you're not
[1:44:21] careful you get between two
[1:44:26] opinions you got to stay
[1:44:30] anchored the devil will try to move you
[1:44:32] into a place where you where you're into
[1:44:35] two opinions and then what he says
[1:44:37] happens is you lose your reason you lose
[1:44:38] your
[1:44:39] purpose look I know what he's talking
[1:44:41] about I remember I had an experience as
[1:44:43] a kid I come into the presence of the
[1:44:45] Lord that I knew he was real because I
[1:44:48] felt his presence uh there was something
[1:44:50] wonderful that happened at Camp I was 12
[1:44:52] years old you know and I I from I got
[1:44:55] home at 12 years old and and 13 years
[1:44:57] old 14 years old it wasn't long until
[1:44:59] you know the kids and Junior I now they
[1:45:01] were starting to experience things and
[1:45:03] whatnot and my parents thought I was
[1:45:05] just playing ball down the street but I

[1:46:59] Christian but as soon as I didn't give a

[1:47:34] that when I lost my reason when I lost
[1:47:38] my
[1:47:39] purpose I got spiritual amesi and I lost
[1:47:43] my
[1:47:46] identity I didn't have all of it because
[1:47:48] I shouldn't have been there in the first
[1:47:50] place but whatever identity I had had in
[1:47:54] justification I had an experience I
[1:47:57] didn't have the Holy Ghost I wasn't
[1:47:59] Sanctified yet but I believe God was
[1:48:04] real and I knew that there was things
[1:48:06] that I didn't do as a Christian but when
[1:48:10] I lost my
[1:48:12] reason I got spiritual Amnesia and just
[1:48:15] like that I forgot who I was why I
[1:48:19] didn't do the things that I did and at
[1:48:21] the age of 15 I got swept out in into a
[1:48:23] life of drugs and alcohol just like

[1:52:33] there you have an
[1:52:38] inheritance there's something that
[1:52:40] belongs to
[1:52:41] you but you got to know who you
[1:52:44] are you got to know what it is that
[1:52:47] belongs to
[1:52:50] you you know I I I was thinking on this
[1:52:54] and it was I had a a worker who worked
[1:52:57] for me in in Arizona and I lived out in
[1:53:00] Arizona for six years and I had a
[1:53:04] worker uh had worked for me his name was
[1:53:07] rapael and and one day he asked
[1:53:10] for he said hey I I gotta not g to be
[1:53:13] able to come from work and I might I
[1:53:16] don't know how long it's going to be uh
[1:53:18] you know I got to go to court and he
[1:53:21] starts to tell me why he's going to
[1:53:22] court and I think that's really
[1:53:25] interesting what what had happened is he
[1:53:28] was before he worked for me he was
[1:53:30] working for a construction
[1:53:31] company and he he opened up some walls
[1:53:34] they were doing a remodel and opened up
[1:53:35] some walls and he found some big old
[1:53:37] ammunition cans he pulled it out and he
[1:53:40] opened it
[1:53:41] up I presume it was nothing but money
[1:53:44] let's just say $100
[1:53:46] bills there was another one he opened it
[1:53:50] up he said I wonder what else is around
[1:53:53] here he started checking in all the
[1:53:55] walls after it was all said and done he
[1:53:58] counted
[1:54:01] $500,000 well what would you do with
[1:54:06] $500,000 now I was thinking brother
[1:54:08] Raphael you know not brother Raphael you
[1:54:11] know he was he was uh he had immigrated
[1:54:14] and I was thinking you know back in your
[1:54:17] country $500,000 would go a long way go
[1:54:21] a long way here
[1:54:24] you know what he did with the
[1:54:25] money well you obviously know cuz he was
[1:54:27] working for
[1:54:29] me he went and told his boss said hey
[1:54:32] boss I want you to know I found this in
[1:54:34] the
[1:54:35] walls he gave it to his
[1:54:37] boss he did the right thing week goes by
[1:54:42] two weeks go by and he's cleaning out
[1:54:43] his boss's truck and he's finding all
[1:54:45] these money
[1:54:46] bans he's
[1:54:48] thinking
[1:54:49] huh my boss is living good off that
[1:54:52] money I found he didn't feel right about
[1:54:54] it so he went and told the homeowners
[1:54:56] said hey I wanted you to know while we
[1:54:58] were doing the remodel I found $500 in
[1:55:01] your
[1:55:02] walls and I gave it to my boss well they
[1:55:05] called the authorities the police came
[1:55:07] in and so now you had the good old court
[1:55:10] case of Finders Keepers losers
[1:55:13] weepers so it went to
[1:55:16] court so the homeowners were saying look
[1:55:20] we're the homeowners that's how
[1:55:23] tows that belongs to us and the
[1:55:26] construction worker in his weak case
[1:55:28] probably because he had already spent a
[1:55:30] little bit of the
[1:55:31] money he says no I found it I get to
[1:55:35] keep it so it starts to go to court well
[1:55:39] it just so happened the people who sold
[1:55:41] the house to the new homeowners found
[1:55:43] out about
[1:55:47] it and they're like wait a
[1:55:49] second it was ours before or it was
[1:55:55] yours so they filed a
[1:55:58] lawsuit so now the court has three
[1:56:03] lawsuits for a sum of money of
[1:56:08] $500,000 who in the world fought the
[1:56:10] ruling so it went to
[1:56:14] appeals and it went to to the appeals
[1:56:18] court and the appeals court wrote and
[1:56:21] and I tell you I got tickled about this
[1:56:23] this happened back in 2008 and I was
[1:56:25] trying to find details on it and they
[1:56:27] released another news story on it like
[1:56:29] last month I thought thank you Lord
[1:56:32] that's they made a ruling on it and they
[1:56:37] said the court of appeals however so you
[1:56:40] have three people laying claims on an
[1:56:41] inheritance
[1:56:44] right Finders Keepers losers
[1:56:48] weepers no it was our house
[1:56:53] it was on our property it's ours the
[1:56:55] other people like wait a second we sold
[1:56:58] you the
[1:56:59] house it was ours before it was
[1:57:02] yours no but you had a clause as is best
[1:57:07] as is Clause
[1:57:11] ever you sold it as is so now they're
[1:57:16] going to let the court settle
[1:57:18] it the court of appeals however
[1:57:20] maintained in 2012 that
[1:57:23] legally the money was technically
[1:57:27] mislaid not
[1:57:29] abandoned so it rightfully belonged to
[1:57:32] the span's estate and The
[1:57:35] Heirs what had happened there was a man
[1:57:37] who lived there and he hid his
[1:57:40] inheritance in the walls of the
[1:57:42] building the daughters didn't know
[1:57:46] that they had retrieved some of the
[1:57:48] things but they didn't know they had an
[1:57:50] inheritance laying in the walls because
[1:57:52] it was veiled it was hidden behind a
[1:57:55] partition but then somebody discovered
[1:57:58] it remember it takes Discovery like that
[1:58:02] little blanket on the back of the couch
[1:58:05] remember the story about how they're
[1:58:07] they're watching the Antique Road Show I
[1:58:10] like to look at this story another way
[1:58:11] like the blanket like I'm the blanket on
[1:58:13] the back of the
[1:58:16] couch here I'm I'm just a a dirty
[1:58:18] blanket on the back of a house uh on the
[1:58:21] back of a couch in a house where a guy
[1:58:24] from his own testimony saying I've never
[1:58:25] had nothing I've never had anything in
[1:58:28] life and and all these things and the
[1:58:29] only value that you thought you had was
[1:58:32] just uh laying on the back of a couch
[1:58:34] but then all of a sudden an expert came
[1:58:37] along that's right there was a hidden
[1:58:40] value that that that had to be
[1:58:42] discovered and all of a sudden Malachi
[1:58:44] 45 said just take it out now look I want
[1:58:47] you to spread out the pages of the Bible
[1:58:49] I want you to look here and look and
[1:58:50] Malachi 4:5 he said behold I sent unto
[1:58:53] you Elijah a prophet and all of a sudden
[1:58:56] you're sitting on the couch like wait a
[1:58:57] second Hallelujah that looks a lot like
[1:59:03] me so shall it be in the days of the
[1:59:06] revealing of the son of man all of a
[1:59:08] sudden the value changed because there
[1:59:10] was
[1:59:11] Discovery there was an inheritance
[1:59:13] laying in the
[1:59:15] walls they didn't even know was
[1:59:20] there but the court made a
[1:59:24] ruling they said that it was
[1:59:27] mislaid technically not abandoned so
[1:59:31] rightfully it belong to the
[1:59:35] HS I say this bride has mislaid the
[1:59:38] promises of God long

[3:10:12] so why do you want to get baptized he
[3:10:14] said I really want to make a decision I
[3:10:16] really feel like this is the time I said
[3:10:19] praise the Lord this is probably the
[3:10:21] last one we've been waiting
[3:10:23] for he's not been too far he's just been
[3:10:25] around here and we've been looking for
[3:10:28] him amen I I I really enjoyed the word
[3:10:31] this morning this is what God does and
[3:10:34] you come to his house and the word is
[3:10:36] preached and something within your heart
[3:10:37] is pricked as the scripture will say and
[3:10:40] some will say what can I do to be saved
[3:10:43] and the formula is right here in the
[3:10:44] Bible as the Lord has given it to us and
[3:10:47] as the disciples spoke and they said uh
[3:10:50] John 2 we read from 37 he says now when
[3:10:53] they heard this they were pricked in
[3:10:54] their heart and they said unto Peter and
[3:10:57] the rest of the Apostle it says men and
[3:10:59] Brethren what shall we do Peter said
[3:11:01] unto him repent and be baptized every
[3:11:04] one of you and it says every one of you
[3:11:07] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[3:11:10] remission of your sins and ye shall
[3:11:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so
[3:11:15] it's the gift that you receive from God
[3:11:17] and he says for This Promise is unto you
[3:11:19] your children's children to all that are
[3:11:22] far off even as many as our Lord God
[3:11:25] shall call so the promise continues on
[3:11:28] even until this day we still bring many
[3:11:30] to the kingdom you want to say
[3:11:35] something I want to thank
[3:11:39] God that he's given
[3:11:43] me to have touched my heart
[3:11:47] to to have opened my
[3:11:51] eyes and I want to start a new life with
[3:11:53] God Amen

[3:12:48] praise God one more added to the body of

[3:12:54] perfect when we see another will come
[3:12:56] into the family amen praise God let's
