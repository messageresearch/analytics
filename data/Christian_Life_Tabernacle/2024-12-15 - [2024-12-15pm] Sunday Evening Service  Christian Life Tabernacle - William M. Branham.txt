Description:
Sunday Evening Service
December 15, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

also we ask for this grace and this Mercy in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen tonight thank you musicians tonight we want to listen to uh it's it's about 46 6 minutes long it was preached in January 9th 1958 in Chicago it's called the called out and and it's just a good uh reminder that we should never forget our ABCs we should never forget really that we are called out and uh I think that's uh that's a blessing to be called out so we haven't been called to conform but we've been called to become separate and the the gospel hasn't changed and and the man has changed the gospel but the gospel hasn't changed it's still the same word of God that it's always been and it hasn't changed and so what we'll do is we we'll just uh uh start uh the tape at this time and and uh brother Matson Bose introduces brother brandom brother brandom just makes a a quick greeting and then uh he reads the scripture so just be about two minutes and then we'll sit down after he reads the scripture so Lord bless you remember he's speaking to you this evening the called out God bless you God bless you and we're so happy to have you with us let us pray oh Lord we are grateful to thee for the privilege of coming out again tonight to worship thee and we would ask that your presence would bless us all and may we tonight have the privilege of seeing you win souls to the kingdom of God bringing back those sheep that's gone on astray oh Eternal and blessed God speak to us through Thy word like never before and give us the desire of our heart to see the children born into the kingdom then heal the sick and Afflicted get Glory out of the service as we commit ourselves unto thee for we ask it in the name of thy holy and beloved Child Jesus amen may be seated I was so happy this afternoon to learn that a little help is on the road for me that brother Tommy Osburn my good brother and friend is to arrive here now with this picture black gold for Saturday night I believe it is and then he will also uh help in Sunday afternoon brother Tommy will be preaching and praying for the sick so I know you will enjoy this great servant of the Lord Brother uh Tommy osbor and now tonight if the Lord willing um I have two Bibles and I don't want to preach both of them through but I had one text or one scripture I wish to read in one and then a text in the other in the book of St Luke's gospel the 17th chapter and beginning with the 20 six verse we read this and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they did drink they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the floods came and destroyed them all likewise also it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and Brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and now by the way of uh text so I read that to have a context in the Blessed scriptures in Genesis the 19th Chapter and the 22nd verse it reads this way Escape thee hither for I can do nothing till thou comes tither now I would like to take for a subject tonight if the Lord would permit it that way the called out last evening it was laid upon my heart to speak on the subject of the handwriting on the wall and the Lord did bless us and not only did he bless us but he furthered his kingdom by letting us read his word and to let the Holy Spirit reveal to us the things that's so close at hand and in doing so we type the Great modern Babylon with the great modern America and we found that in this nation of ours today we found ourselves in the same kind of a fix that they were in when they had a handwriting on the wall then we also found out that we have a handwriting on the wall and the same conditions Marley speaking they were drinking wine with the ill famed women in those days called concubines and today call well movie stars and so forth they were in their class then but now they're just scattered all everywhere sin is like a EG that's been broken in a saucer and sin would be the yellow in the middle I believe it's called the Yoke and when you go to picking in that Yol it scatters all over the egg and that's the way sin is you just going to commercializing it and uh and fixing it up and making it look pretty and giving it another name you scatter it through everywhere that's what sin has did in this great lovely nation of ours it has been glamorized I mean glamourized sin has become glamour years ago they used to have old Charlie Barleycorn a horrible looking creature with his hat pulled down over his ears and look like some prehistoric animal that was the Charlie Barleycorn of a few years ago today he's all polished up he's in what they call a bumper and he's popular in a lot of so-called Christian ice boxes right but he's the same old evil demon right it used to be that sometimes Grandma for a toothache should smoke an old cane pipe but oh how popular that devil has become daughter mother and the little children even smoke and it's popular but it's sin just the same it's just hid under another name it used to be wrong for people to gamble they had places like of ill Fame where such things went on saloons where respectable people did attend and women used to when they would come down the street where there was a saloon that pass on the other side but today she puts her foot on the bar let some little babysitter take care of her children and she's become a butterfly instead of a mother she's more popular gambling it used to be in the dens and Dives of the low underworld has become that every time company comes they get out the cards and go to playing it's still sin God will make you pay for your sin he hates sin because he's a holy God and the holy God cannot tolerate sin if he could have stood sin he would have stopped the whole thing when the first sin was committed but sin requires death and they that do such is dead already in sin and trespasses I know that hurts but that's what I mean it to do is the hurt we seen that through them great evils we see a sweep of the oncoming judgments for this country for God cannot let us get by with sin he could not be a righteous God and let us live the way we're living without making us pay pay for it as I have said before I say again if the god of Heaven lets us get by with what we're doing you to be just would have to resurrect Sodom and gomorra and apologize to him for distra and for we're just as bad as they were maybe worse and now anyone who has the slightest bit of real spirit of God in them can feel the hot blast of the oncoming judgment in your spirit you can discern and know that there is something fixing to happen the whole world is quivering the little Nations the big Nations for in the hands of bolix communist ungodly bloodless heartless Cults lays the power to send this world to its ashes in one minute time just the mercies of God being longsuffering is also a hold in it we can be become Russia's satellite before in the morning and yet we don't notice it we just go right on and they don't know what all this nervous condition's about when the world has become a neurotic even the psychiatrists themselves are having nervous breakdowns the natural will never be able to interpret the supernatural neither could The Magicians and the astrologers ever read the handwriting on the wall it put the spirit fill man to do so those astrologers could not read unknown tongues they had not the gift of interpretation to know the supernatural therefore they didn't know what it was all about that's what the world is today theyve Dilly DED along in the things of rock and roll parties and big Shin digs in their churches and cold farmal sermons on the flowers and so forth and the gospel has been neglected right and they know nothing about the supernatural you can speak to them on this all together message that should be taught everywhere of the coming of the Lord and they laugh at it it's the most needed message in the land but the spiritual people the Born Again knows that something's fixing to happen and they're happy about it because it's the coming of the Lord Jesus the second time for his church but the unsaved they don't know what it's all about it seems to be a supernatural move I had the privilege just the last couple years of having one of the greatest meetings the Lord ever let me have in Bombay India and just before getting there I'd studied much of their Nation found out that the mids of Persians that took Babylon from belto cure their tribes settled up there and called the Hindus today and then when I was reading in their paper and I had the clipping of it yet today something that was startling when I read something that seems to have a spiritual significance I like to keep it for God never moves unless it means something and I was reading that where they said in their paper that just had a great earthquake that shook a great part of their country you read that in your own American papers about two years ago and it was said for about two or three days before this earthquake struck a great strange thing took place that all the sheep and the cattle that used to hang around around the walls in India instead of having fences they have walls and their barns Are Made of Stone many of them and where the cattle would stand around in the shade of the wall all the cattle and the Sheep tuck off to the middle of the field and the little birds that had their nest up in the Coes of the barns flew away out into the forest before the earthquake happened because the walls would fall on them there was no one to drive them out there was no literal sign to show that there was an earth quake coming but being that God takes care of his own they had a feeling they was impressed by the Holy Spirit to get out way from the trouble and it seems to me that man who are made in the image of God feeling this great pressure coming on should go to safety but they don't do it they won't listen though the warning voice of God speaks day after day right night after night but man desires to live in sin you know it's later than we think people thinks they got plenty of time but the scriptures declares it's later than we think Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man let us see what taken place in the days of the coming of the destruction and judgment in the days of Noah and in the days of lot they were both affiliated with the third destruction Jesus said just as it were in those days so will it be when the son of man comes the third the second time it'll be just like was Dan and we're taught that in the days of Noah and not only at that time but in the days of lot as Junction times and every time before judgment comes to the Earth God sends Mercy call just before the days of the anti luian destruction God sent a prophet to the Earth Enoch and he sent an angel and he sent a message and he did the supernatural but what did man do they eat they drink they planted they build they rejected the called of the message though the message that each of those men both lot and Noah their message consisted of this grace mercy and deliverance right Grace God's mercy to the people was presented through Grace and Deliverance was presented to the people but they turned it down that's right what did we find them doing laughing scoffing making fun Maring wives living in adultery building planning look at the building program today and let me say something something right here also look at the advancement in the scientific world right now I say this not to scandalize neither do I say it to hurt feeling I only said because it's the truth but those kind of works comes from the other side the sons of King become great Builders and great scientists The Temper Iron and Metals and build and the great scientific world was a very religious world but come from Kain but the lineage that come from SE were poor humbled peasant type who believed God and when the prophet preached they received it when the supernatural was done they received it yes and when Deliverance was offered they receiv received it and the other side perished in the judgments of the Lord God they thought because they were smart that they could just live with any woman they wish to because they were smart they could drink and it was nobody's business but God hates sin yes and he will not let it go unjudged and the very thing that destroyed the unbeliever tuck the believer to safety it was the Waters of judgment that destroyed the unbeliever and it was the same Waters that packed Noah to safety and it's the gospel message that will destroy the unbeliever that'll take the church in the Rapture before the Judgment ever strikes they will be safely carried through Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and when this is done then the end time shall be right when the gospel has reached the world our blessed blessed savior said then the end shall be now he never said when you passed tracks over the world or when you sent Bibles over the world or when you have sent missionaries over the world but when this gospel has been preached what is the gospel then Paul said the gospel came came to us not in word only but through the power and the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit making the word manifest for if you follow the very next verse when he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he said these son shall fall follow them that believe lo I Am With You Always even to the end of the world to manifest himself the same yesterday today and forever most time when we try to bring this message our words seem to to the world as like just Lots did to his kin folks it seems to be that we were mocking to them are their Idle Words Their pastors either byass this great message of Deliverance or try to explain it out into another generation to come but the facts of it is that the angel of the Lord is present to confirm the word and manifest the power of the Holy Ghost and these signs follow they tried to Mock and they said to lot well they just made fun of lot his own Kindred and lot was a just man the Bible said that their sins vexed his righteous Soul daily to see the perversion and this nation is loaded with it the misusing of the human body when it's on the Rampage alcohol ICS dope things teenage juvenile delinquency just like it was then and Men mock at it and when they see the supernatural signs of the Lord God they try to say that we're mocking religion someone said not long ago wrote me a letter some great doctor of divinity and he said Mr brandham get next to yourself you're trying to impersonate the Lord Jesus said you're only making them mock how little this poor decrepit man knew that it's not a man can do that it's the sign of the end time and he's fulfilling it but they mocked that lot oh don't listen to him the man's crazy how could this great place be destroyed how could Sodom and gomorah the greatest City on the KNN Earth how could it be destroyed with fire in Brimstone they say today how could the world be burnt over how could the world be destroyed my most beloved brother the same word of God that spoken into existence says she'll go out of existence by the same way it was spoken by the word of the Lord amen that is true God be merciful to this poor miserable blind wretched naked Nation did not the bible say that you say I'm riched and increased in Goods I have needed nothing and know not that th miserable wretched blind and naked and don't know it what a pitiful condition I want you to notice something just for a moment that comes to my mind Before Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah we find that God's had a prophet up on top of the mountain by the name of Abraham and he had given him a prop and he was willing to take the hard way and preach the real true word than to live in sin and was just before this great destruction taken place that the angel of the Lord met him I want you to watch now Noah's time it was water Sodom and gomorra it was fire and we're taught by God's most holy word that this time it'll be fire right right I notice the scriptures speaking Sarah around the hundred years old Abraham 90 and9 years old then Sarah would be 80 n so many years ago had ceased to be with her as it is with women but yet Abraham held on for he knew that God was able to keep his promise he was faithful he stayed by the word the word that God had spoken to him that's how Angels appear to people it's when you stay by the word not by manmade theology but by the word thus sayeth the Lord that's when the Angels appear Abraham stayed by the word and while he was sitting under the oak one day he saw three men coming up and he was spiritual for he know that God was still God and as these men begin to appear Abraham run out to meet them and said s stop in just a moment and let me fetch you just a little water to wash your feet and we'll make a little cake and then you refresh yourself then you can be going for this cause you have come oh wish I had time to go into those words for this cause you have come and so when the little meal was made ready and Abraham stood watching these men eat the angel had his back turned to the tent the Bible said his back was to the tent and Sarah was on the inside of the tent what's the nature of this Angel bringing the last message Before Destruction he said Abraham I'm going to keep my promise to you yes I love that that's our Father God I'll keep my promise to you just about the time of life according to the time of Life about the next 28 days I'm going to visit you and that baby that you waited for these 25 years you're going to have it poor little Sarah kind of weak in faith but in them days the circumcision of the man brought the woman in also for only the circumcision could be recognized before God and the female could not be circumcised therefore the husband was the atonement for her because they are one Abraham's Faith helped Sarah at that time Sarah back in the tent behind the angel when the angel said Sarah will have the baby Sarah in her heart not out loud in her heart she laughed and the angel with his back to the tent looking Abraham in the face said why did Sarah laugh what kind of a telepathy is that in the tent Discerning her thought behind him don't you see how the scripture makes that plain that was the last warning message Before Destruction open your eyes behind him in the tent not out loud but in her heart and the angel of the Lord discerned what she did what did she laugh and she was called forth and she was trembling she said I didn't laugh he said oh yes you did laugh that was the angel bringing the light CH message before fire fell from heaven Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom and gomorah so will it be in the days that the son of man is revealed from Heaven Hallelujah that's right you see the message when the son of man is revealed from heaven now when this Angel went to s and begin to speak his message to a man they mo at him and laughed at him and they would not receive the message neither do they do it today it's the very same thing that's right and they won't believe it there's only one thing left that's judgment but notice the Bible said they'd be like that in second Timothy 3 the Bible said that they will be in the last days the spirit speaks expressly that's directly not to that day but to the last day man shall be heav high minded lovers a television uh things of the world that's goes in with it lovers of the world more than the lovers of God truce Breakers and false accusers and despisers of those which are good you say that's atheist brother renam that must be communist that's American so-called Christians having a farm of godliness but denying the power the supernatural of the Gospel from such get away from their walls from such turn away for this is a sort that goes from house to house and with societies and so forth silly women captive with sin taken away with divver lust well all kinds of parties and my church does this and we have so much time but no time to seek the holy ghost in the notion and minds of God they denied no time but I want you to notice lot and also oh notice Noah before any rain could ever fall before one drop of marure come from the oncoming clouds of judgment as we read last night and I believe truly by the gospel we see the handwriting on the wall anybody I believe that was mentally balanced could see that we have just a few hours left and maybe this is the last one but before one drop of water of judgment fell Noah went in the [Applause] ark and did not Abraham say to the angel would the judge of all the Earth make the innocent suffer with the guilty certainly not the judge of all the Earth will do righteous and notice before there was even one Speck of fire that come from the skies lot was taken out of Sodom Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah and in the days of lot so will it be in in the coming of the Son of God and if the handwriting's on the wall if the time of judgment is at hand how close is the rapture of the church how close is it tonight think of it Noah went into the ark for safety lot came out of Sodom one came out the other went in what is it the type of when it's conglomerated together it's a type of the church coming out of the world for safety and going into the Ark of Christ to go to Glory one come out the other went in one come out to keep from being destroyed with the world the other went into the Ark of Safety and Christ is the Ark of Safety and remember before that the judgments of hail fire and darkness swept over Egypt Israel made her way to Goan where there was light and Egypt was left to wonderand in the darkness that's right men and women listen to me now before you're left on this Earth of misery and caner here in sin run to the light as hard as you can go the light Christ Jesus and accept his message of Mercy hurry said the angel and Escape tither for I can't do nothing till thou has come out judgments cannot come Russia's got the missile that'll put on us on our knees and so our scientist says that we are five years behind them it'll be five years before we can catch up to where they are now our little spudnik fizzled about three foot off the ground theirs made trip after trip around the world what is it speaking to us God saying to his church come hither for I can do nothing till thou has come hither God waiting for his church to break down their denominational bearers and come together for a real outpouring of the Holy Spirit to lift her to Glory I can do nothing until thou comes thither waiting for us to come together Jesus said when the son of man is revealed from heaven let me close by saying this that the son of man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother bandham it is now and I hope I won't have to make this so personal of this own meeting but that your spirit within you that's give you by God can read what I'm talking about the son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in Mercy showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on Earth revealing himself like he did to Abraham before the destruction he has come now in Mercy revealing himself to the church it's being laughed at and scof that the next time he reveals himself it'll be in judgment on the world and the Nations that's forgot God and send their way of Grace their day of Grace rather away because they have forgotten God and and they're doing the same thing that they did to the angel of the Lord back there mocking and making fun of it right but he sure now in Mercy he will come in judgment upon the Nations and while he is being revealed in Mercy oh hurry ye hither run quickly children get away from these manmade Babylonian theological w walls of unbelief in cold formalism run away from man-made theology get out in the middle of the feeling God's grace and there scream for Mercy for it is his blood of his own son that gives the mercy to us get away from this old world of Doubt get away from your superstitions accept God's message of Mercy Hallelujah and his message of deliverance and flee to the middle of his grace and there scream oh Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me for the walls of these man-made doctrines is going to crumble and perish with the unbelieving world for they that believe not perish with those who believe not the world of unbelief perish with those who believe not but righteous lot was taken out and so was Noah yes think of it while we pray just a moment wasn't that a great reminder huh puts things back into perspective you know what what what we believe the son of man the son of man is here now he said and you he said well people sit back and ask and they say well why hasn't he come yet God can do nothing till you run hither you you understand he's waiting for us to manifest and like we talked about this morning uh there just so many beautiful things he says he he said you you know I like what he said he said the same God that spoke the world into existence you know people say well how is it how's the world going to be destroyed the same way it came into existence the same way it's going to go out of existence by the word of God you know man just thinks he can outsmart God that just I I don't know poor pathetic things that we are huh God's got it exactly in control you also notice he made a statement I thought was tremendous he said that the angel of the Lord appears where men are trying to follow the word of God you know what I mean so just picture this in your life if if and you know what the angel of the Lord did it brought the super natural so if you're doing your best to be a Christian like we talked this morning is not possessing the a attributes that we're after it's using the attributes is what that we're wanting to achieve to have the faith I I I love Martha's testimony because the man was sick and she say caregiver and and she the faith moved on her and she finally got down and prayed with him and said you're not going to be sick today you're not going to die today you're going to be well I'm going to pray for you well that man now became the recipient of the attribute that she had within her that she knew God was a Healer and now something Supernatural happened the man got up and was doing well well we know the man's at the end of his time but just think he got a taste of the supernatural because somebody was willing to take an attribute and the love that was in their heart and to to press that love forward that there would be somebody to receive it and and and I I just thought it was good I hope I not embarrass her in any way but the first thing Satan tried to do was to play it down to play her down to to play the situation down to talk you out of it that's what that's what Satan always tries to do talk you out of it but he can do nothing till we come hither and and so we know we're in the day of the son of man we know we're in the day of the fulfilling of the word so what's he waiting on he's waiting on us to get back to the faith that was once delivered to us not get away from it but get back to it get back to it to I mean I just thought this I I really enjoyed that and if if we wanted to stay or if you can go it's called it's called the message is called the called out and then he demonstrates the secret of the knowing and the calling out out of the secrets of the heart and he said I hope that you can see it and you know what took place people would come up before him they'd come up before him he would take he took them by the hand and he could show them by what was going on in his hand what they was and then it came to the time that he actually didn't even they didn't even have to take him by the hand sometimes he would still take them by the hand it never left that that they could see something naturally you know he says look at my hand you see the bumps they can see the bumps he says you see the bumps go away you're well amen but he would also just come up and say You're such and such you're from such and such place and and you've got this wrong with you I see a doctor standing over oh you've got this problem you've got that problem then he would just turn out in the audience and go right down the road you know one time there's a bunch of unbelief in the building he just started one side of the Pew and went right down every single row all the way down you can't you we serve a supernatural God church amen we're not going to get out and fuss and fight with this Doctrine or what this church is doing or or where they're going that's not what we're called to do we're called to make the Lord Jesus live in our lives and what's been freely given to us we freely give to others and if we seek to do the word of the Lord the angels of God are en camped about them that fear them they're camped about the righteous and you'll see the supernatural in your life working and God will do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can even ask or or think it's just it it it's just the way it is and and I like that little thing about Sin being like a yolk on an egg you you poke it you know what I mean and it just runs everywhere and and isn't that simply what they've done today they've made sin glamorous they did they've idolized the the the rainbow movement I think they call it and they have parades and they have days set aside and and that's all the handwriting on the wall for us let's don't forget get the handwriting on the wall let's don't forget it let's don't let it numb us down you know and and and and create a fear in us where we won't stand up for the things that are our Christianity and for the power of God they want to create an atmosphere where Faith can't work and if Faith can't work we can't work and if we can't work we can't get ready and and the bride's made itself ready so I I really hope you enjoyed the the tape tonight I thought it was spectacular I don't know if many of you have heard that tape or or or it's it's just kind of one of those that contains so much you know what I mean it really contains so much I could uh I listened to it earlier and I listen to it again and I'll listen to it again and I want to go listen to it again so that's just how it is you know what I mean it's just it's it's just so full but anyway Lord richly bless you for coming out tonight and I I know it's cold and and everything but if if you want to uh run up to the custard place I'll buy you a cone okay cones are cheaper there I think than they are Brams I'm not sure you're not sure don't everything's terrible but anyway we love you we love this message you love this message amen CU there there's just nothing like it Church nothing like it I mean uh I mean just to see the ministry of the son of man and uh without it you will never prepare for the to get free of the Judgment so I just trust that you had a blessed day and we pray for everybody keep uh uh brother Mariam uh in in in prayer brother Mariam Alexander he's have kind of got to the place where he's a little bedridden and I know some of the Brethren have went and visited him uh just please keep them in prayer and if you can get by to visit with him uh he certainly I'm sure would appreciate it and uh um you know I I just don't know what it would be like to be in in you know be bedridden U I know that if I I was I'd surely be nice to see a smiling face and someone to come talk to me and and speak some words of encouragement and remember that's what the scripture tells us you know go the extra mile give your cloak you know do the works of Christianity let's stand together this evening Lord richly bless you and uh next next Sunday uh we're only going to have one service that Sunday the Sunday before Christmas we'll have one service on that Sunday and then the following Sunday I believe it's the Sunday before New Year's we'll only have one Service uh that Sunday and then uh and I don't know um uh is chis what day is Christmas on Wednesday so guess what we're not going to have Wednesday service on Christmas unless that's the day you want to bring me my Christmas present and then then we'll maybe we will have service no no service on that day okay so uh uh and then uh uh so we just want to let you know all that so amen let's just bow our heads and have word of pray our gracious Heavenly Father what a wonderful message we heard as our messenger was bringing to the church and introducing them to the promise of the son of man in this last day that the signs and wonders that were being performed were promised from the scriptures brother bm's Ministry wasn't built by him by his faith or by his nature or his Spirit it was built by the word of God prophesied and fulfilled and brought to pass and Lord we saw as the ministry went that it was a sign of the son of man given before the oncoming judgment and then father we begin to see as it was in the days of the the voice of the seventh angel that the mysteries of God would be revealed father then we saw the ministry went to open the seals and reveal the church age messengers of the age and the spirit of each of the ages and how that Spirit came up through the church and father we've seen so much has been open to our hearts and it's father that we could understand that we are the called out and as this tape said tonight the called out those who could read the handwriting on the wall who could see the sign of the time were the called out those that could recognize the supernatural that God was separating by calling forth the people that they could recognize that father the called out and father may we with humility and a contrite spirit recognize ourselves as being the called out with humility father and graciousness and meekness and kindness and gentleness father accept our election that you've chosen us and elected us and father that we have a duty to go into all the world and preach the gospel to manifest the attrib Utes father father if we have goodness in our heart May there be someone that can receive the goodness that we have to offer the kindness that we have to offer father may you come alive in your church father many people say it's the bride coming of Christ but maybe really it's the bride coming to Christ is what we need and father we just trust that that would be our example bless us tonight and thank you for this day father bless those that couldn't be here father for work or for whatever reason father if there any be sick we just ask that you would quickly Lord Jesus bring strength and and health to them Father that they might be about your business father we pray for Matthew and F Daran as they're in India father and they're they're traveling and father seven and8 hour bus rides just that they can meet with different ministers that have never heard of this message before and introduce the message we ask that you would Grant it to them father in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen so we just ask those blessings this evening you know I believe India think I don't know if it has twice the population of China but it's about 1/4 of the area so it's a lot of people a lot close together and if you want to get an idea of travel there just take your phone and Google India train rides and India bus rides and you'll see people sitting on top on the back out the window in everywhere and you know they it ain't they don't have what's called First Class you know what I mean they they have I don't know what they have but and I I'm not saying it's just a very very very densely populated country but that's good because there's a lot of people that can hear the gospel and everybody deserves an opportunity to hear the gospel so I I I I appreciate it because what they're doing they're going there to meet with the ministers and and if those guys can catch the Revelation then they'll spread and it'll grow and who knows maybe the last ones there yes right so if we make ourselves ready they make their selves ready we'll go out of here and that's what we're all about so Lord bless you what how do you what is that leaning on the Everlasting arm that what that is ohen no Standing on
