us and lift this up in jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen god bless you you may be seated tonight and then i was looking to see where cosmonaut andrew is sitting is andrew with us tonight andrew are you here here he is i want you to come up and testify about going to pray for the sister in the hospital i just as he's coming you know brother andrew and brother cosman a few weeks ago went to pray for somebody and and the lord really undertook so i felt led on my heart i said you know why don't you and brother cosby go pray for sister marara and can you hear me sister mararan and uh so um and then so they went and did that and they i got a little text back uh talking how the lord worked so i just want him to testify of it you know some people have gifts you know and and you never know they just someone you might not think anything but yet god hears their prayers so we're just grateful for that and it's one of the gifts so i wanted him to testify before we talked a little bit about the word god bless you brother andrew tell us about it it's good to be in church tonight god bless you all isn't god good amen i i would always love to tell of his wonderful faithfulness to his word i've seen god move and it's just always so wonderful how that in situations where there's a need there's always like the scripture says deep calleth to the deep and so if we have needs there's got to be something to respond and so as we're knitted together as the bodies join together there's always a ministering whether you're a housewife or just a a young man going to school doing work it's just so wonderful to see the handiwork of god bringing us together and as we everyone has a part to play and so sometimes needs will arise and even in stressful situations those are the times where sometimes you don't even feel like you have time you don't feel like you have energy but that's when god wants to take over and so i just want to say that's the way it was when you know this need arised and i'm so grateful you know it's something you know there's a scripture that says if you delight yourself in the lord he'll give you the desire of your heart and something that i've noticed over the years i really desire to know a brother that's been coming here for a number of years and we've heard requests come through email and different things about his wife um in a great battle and you know sometimes it's it's in times of great trials that you really can connect with somebody that you can really start burying their burden you know that's the law of christ right and so i was able to hear of the request and immediately brother cosman and i you know we took this to prayer and and we were just seeking the mind of the lord and we've seen the hand of god because god's wanting to declare the supernatural to us by promise and aren't you thankful like what the way the lord's leading our pastor into the word of god to take the spiritual food because it's almost like as we're giving opportunity to take god at his word it's shaking out all of the uncertainty you know it's giving us that direct beam of light that we can just follow after and so as we've uh you know felt tasked to go into all the world we've seen god's faithfulness and so we we embrace the moment we embrace the opportunity we don't fear you know even like what we heard you know our lives were pre-planned by god so there's a place of rest for us you know and so we can take god at his word and i'll just say i'm not really thinking to to really testify before you all but i just know that you know god's faithful so so if god's made a promise real to you then you can take that sword that you've been equipped with and and it's from faith to faith so i just i was i was testifying about how that even in this time i was able to really get to know my brother john more and more and to be able to meet his wife and to really be able to bear his burden to to fit my feet in his shoes for a moment and then just watch how the lord would actually grab grab the experiences that he's brought us through and now it can be from faith to faith and the very love of christ that you've received now goes to work on behalf of somebody else and we've just seen the the very presence of god move into the room but the cosman and i just fellowshipping really just desiring to see what god has isn't it wonderful we don't have to figure anything out we just be led of the lord isn't that a promise of god's word he said sons and daughters are led by the spirit of god and what about an hour like now where everything's just people are starting to cool off and just relax but sometimes there's got to be a shaking to to thrust us into action and so i believe that's one of the things that's happening right now through these great needs in the great trials that that others are going through you know i can go through and see different ones but we were just led by the lord by the love in our heart to go and to fellowship with our brother precious brother they've been enduring this for five years and it's just a tremendous thing to see that the the countenance you know because that's what god does when he comes and shines the light it just changes the countenance and it really can invigorate so so the things that you go through and how god's brought you victory those victories are great when when you experience him but it's to actually bring you to a place where you can point others and actually walk with them to victory and so we just saw as we uh fellowship with them a bit and uh we we shared from our heart the word of god brother cosman poured his heart out we'd been praying and fasting and just seeking the will of the lord and i believe the lord showed up and our sister gladys she you know the scripture that was on my heart you know it's james it's a promise he says if there's any sick we just we just read this scripture and in obedience to the word of god we we became doers in that moment and as we prayed and you know we placed our hands upon her we got to fellowshipping after it because the presence came so thick and and she just testified to me that she's healed and so you know it's to the glory of god that we move and we breathe god has given us something so great and so real to be able to take god at his word to be changed to be put in service for him and to declare that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever i mean what a calling what a hope that we have and to be able to go in and and see our brother encourage i'm telling you it's just it's it gives you such peace and and you know you might feel you might feel a little bit you know the the pressing of your own battle and your own thing but oh my when you can see god use a situation it's a great encouragement so i just say god's faithful take him at his word and he is moving so praise god god bless you my cousin why don't you come up and kind of share with us the events that took place and and what when what went on and what happened from here thank you praise god so um brother david had um pulled me over on sunday evening and you know you can say how a pastor would just have a burden for somebody and you know we try to sometimes just put ourselves in our brother's shoes and just try to um try to maybe somewhat put ourselves in the condition where you're like what is he feeling like what can i do and so brother david is like hey i would just like for you to see if you can get one touch for brother john and just go with brother andrew and and just go out there and pray for it's just a gladys so brother john and and i uh texted a few times there was a few little um schedule maybe conflicts that he was working and then i was trying to get off of work and so lord willing we just decided to go tuesday night and so you know i was i was really just sensitive in prayer i was fasting for a few days and i just wanted the lord to move and i knew that you know because god put a burden on our heart that he would have to deliver it because otherwise there would be no burden and so you know as i'm talking to my sweet brother john he's such a wonderful brother if you guys haven't talked to him i i would say you you you talk to him after service because he's he's just a he's a wonderful brother and so we uh scheduled to go there around seven o'clock on tuesday and um you know right before we ended up going to the hospital the lord just put a scripture on my heart and it was in romans chapter 12 and it really spoke to me because we have to prove god's word and it's not me that's the that's doing it but it's god that's doing it through us and so if we become an available vessel now god could prove himself individually not for my will but for his will and we know he has a perfect will so chapter 12 of romans it says be i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not confirmed conformed to this world but ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god and so we we go with the scripture in our heart and brother andrew and i were just kind of fellowshipping on our way to the hospital and you know a lot of supernatural things that happened as we were going towards the room and we didn't even pay attention to it and you know one of those were we started fellowshipping and this might seem really small but i i you know it's amazing um so we we we get into the elevator and brother john is just expressing his heart and we're talking and nobody presses a button to where to go i'm serious and all of a sudden we wake up at the 13th floor the right floor that we were supposed to be at i mean you know and so brother john's pressing the button you're like are we here like yeah yeah this is the floor oh okay well none of us spread you know so that's supernatural that's the leading of the lord you know we might think that's something small but that's just increasing your faith and so i look at andrew and i said well god's moving so we walk in towards the room we couldn't find the room but john eventually asked the nurse and we find a room and we walk in the room and you know sister gladys was in there and she was just you know on the bed and just trying to get comfortable and so we introduced ourselves and you know you can tell the sweetness of her heart just you know the struggles and the suffering and maybe the pain that she's been going through and you know we were just trying to get to know one another and just kind of open up the word of god well i'll tell you the devil was fighting and he was fighting very hard because i i i don't know if it was maybe 10 15 minutes or maybe even 20 minutes but i i mean as soon as we walked in the room and we were starting to talk about the lord you're talking about distraction of the distraction you know a nurse came in and and wanted to do something and you know it was it for me it was just kind of in a place where it wasn't needed but they came in and asked three questions now those questions were just like are you okay do you need anything are you you know just like simple questions and as she's walking out another person comes in and so now we're you know and then ten minutes later or five minutes later as we're trying to talk um another person comes in it's like well we brought your dinner and so it's just all of these distractions and you can feel that you know we were trying to get into the presence of god as the word was just kind of speaking to us even to myself and so you know after a while the lord just settled the room and you know i believe that god spoke in the hospital room that night and i was telling brother andrew as we were coming back and i was even telling brother john i said you know um i believe that god's word is healing power and it's not my prayer it may be us just getting as an anointed vessel maybe to be before a service or maybe before an individual but if god's word goes forth that provides deliverance that provides the healing and that provides the eternal life that gives the life to the individual and it's that that does it and so that's very important as a believer that we always have god's word on our lips and so if in sincerity we speak that with all of our heart and we know that what we speak is god's word then there's nothing to fear brother david said on sunday if you speak the truth you don't have to remember it it's eternal because it'll always recognize itself and the individual and where it needs to go to and so as as we were fellowship and i believe for a good hour an hour and a half um in there we you know brother andrew uh anoints her with all we read the scripture and you know we started praying well um you know as we were just united and holding hands together you know the lord really just moved on the scene and you can feel the presence of god in that room and you know it was it was such a it was such an atmosphere that we wouldn't we didn't want to let go of our hands of one another and just the love and the peace that was in that room and you know sister gladys was just holding on to our hands me and andrew's hands real hard and and so um you know at the end as we get done praying sister gladys is just you know saying a prayer of faith at the end and she's just thanking the lord for what he's done for her you know she testified with her own lips that she was touched and right after we get them praying um you know i started fellowshipping with brother john as we were walking out of the room and and she looked over at brother andrew and she said you know as you guys were praying and and we were under the atmosphere i felt something inside of me and the pain that i had in my stomach disappeared i no longer feel it and so you know for us it was just a testimony and we continued to believe and so just continued to pray for her continue to just keep her in prayer continue to keep brother john in prayer i know he's been going through a lot and just a you know a lot of things that happens with situations like that when you when you battle a devil like that for four or five years it you know it's i can't put myself in that position because i haven't been through that but you know it's it's good for us to be united it's good for us to be one body it's good for us to be able to just put ourselves you know brother branham stood in the gap for a lot of people and that was the first fruit of maturity that came in our day and if we're reflecting that same light we can stand in the gap for somebody if god could use us as individuals and we claim that we have god's word on our lips when a brother or sister has a need we can use what god gave us which is the word of god and stand in the gap for a brother or sister and i believe that with all my heart and so um you know just like brother andrew said god's moving and if god's moving make yourself an available vessel amen god bless you [Applause] i don't know brother john are you here tonight by any chance no i didn't know sometimes he makes it out on wednesday where are you ready brother john you hide from me i want you to say something never let us know that the people will know what gladys has been going through and how god's been blessing you amen thank you yeah i'm sure i never started before many people before but i feel encouraged to say something just a little thing like before we even started praying or praising god in that room the presence of the lord was there when i spoke or the brother over the phone i could feel some push that means it was wonderful i've never had that experience before i was kind of like losing hope exhausting embarrassed but after those prayers and after meeting with the brothers i just felt encouraged and right now i'm very encouraged god bless you [Applause] so brother john now sister gladys has been battling what yeah but it's what cancer okay so she's been battling cancer and and uh and so um we just know that when the believers put their shoulder to the wheel it don't matter what it is yeah i don't care what what label you put on what the enemy's doing you know he tries to come in a lot of different names but his own name and that which is satan and so we just think that's wonderful so i mean let's stand to just read a few scriptures tonight just have a um just a little short time in the lord so let's just start in the right in the beginning of our bible because this is where everything starts right here or this is the record of where it began to start we know it started in him but this is what he says in genesis 1 1 he says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and and and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light and let's just go over to um the gospel of saint john and we'll read in the gospel of saint john and one in five so we're just and it says here it was a worried one through five of the gospel of saint john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was in the beginning with god so the word was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not and then we'd also like to continue internal over the saint the 14th chapter of the gospel of saint john and and it says here in the gospel of saint john the 14th chapter it says let not your hearts be troubled believe ye and god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so i would not have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go to prayer prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also amen and whither i go you know and the way you know and thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou goest and and how can we know the way jesus said i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me and then we'll read our last scripture found in the book of revelations and and in revelations the first chapter we'd like to read there and we'd like to read the one through the seventh verse in the book of revelations and the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servant things which much shortly must come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bore record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and and they that hear the words of this prophecy and who keep those things which are written wherein for the time is at hand and john in the seven church ages which were in eight john to the seven church ages which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which were before him and his throne and from john and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and is the first to begotten and who it was the first begotten from the dead and was the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loveth us and washed us of our sins and from our own blood by our sins by his own blood and and he was made as king and priest in the kingdom of the father unto the glory and dominion of his son behold he that cometh in the cloud and every eye shall see and every uh shall and they which also pierced him and all the kings of the earth and the shall well because of him even saith the amen i am the alpha in omega the beginning and the end saith the lord which is and which is and which was and which it is to come the almighty heavenly father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated and we just wanted to read those scriptures because i think it's so beautiful when we're able to place our faith in the great plan of god and you know and when we as christians can move pl past you know you you've got that you've got uh saved and we're not just saved because if i i kind of just want to approach this for a couple of moments it says you've got to you have to get saved or or you're gonna go to hell you know that's kind of the attitude so many times that people uh place towards salvation is if you're not saved you're going to go to the bad place and you know that and i i believe our salvation is it has lifted us way past those things amen is that we're it where is in and we're not christians and and and if we don't get saved if you don't get saved you're going to go to the bad place so our life isn't a life to avoid something that is negatively approaching us or from the standpoint like hell is what everybody's going to get that don't believe well if we could kind of step into it in a greater light we're not saved to avoid hell amen that's not what our approach is and where our approach is and uh so as we as we look at this if we could say you know christianity isn't based on avoiding hell and that's what a lot of people's approach is and that's their viewpoint on but i believe christianity is higher because christianity isn't avoiding hell it's the it's the revelation of of your purpose in god and so that's what our faith is wants to be and and what we want to rest in is an understanding and new approach that we're not living to avoid hell but for us as christians we begin to understand that it's the revelation of the of our purpose in him and the understanding that we had a purpose in him before eat the foundations of the world and if we have eternal life so our our our our faith isn't uh if i could say this a faith of uh that looking for what for what uh our faith isn't of faith like i've said it's not a faith or a faith in the teaching or faith in jesus that we're not going to go to hell that that's not our faith faith christianity isn't the faith if we believe and do these things we won't go to hell in other words but if we we can look for when we have faith we look for something that's beyond that because faith looks for what what his will will be or faith looks for what if i cannot if i could say this what will be okay not not a will in the fact that we're we're sitting what's his will or what his will but his will raises us up to the place that faith looks is looking for what will be or what is the hid hidden and revealed so if there's a hidden will for our life as we get there so if if faith looks for a hidden will but or what his will be or what is hid and revealed so there's something that god has planned for our life he's got a plan for our life and faith seeks that and and it looks at it and and and what is hid and and his head from the wise and prudent but it's delivered unto us and so as we become christians it's not that oh i'm trying to avoid the bad place and oh or i've got to live right or i'm going to go to hell and and uh i i'm so worried about doing wrong but with our faith raises up we our faith begins to seek for the will that god has for our life that he has a will for our life he has a purpose for our life he has something that that is spoken there's a will that spoken for us and we're trying to find that will and i'd like to uh uh kind of if i could just let's just jump over to the book of revelations again i think we did revelations the first chapter and um the book of reverend the first chapter and it says in the and in the rebel he says the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to that god gave unto him to show to a servant the show does he gave to show unto his servant the things which might shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his angel which is his servant to his servant john and bear record of the word of the kingdom and the testimony of jesus christ which all things he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that heareth the words of the prophecy and keepeth these things which are written from the from the first added wherein is written for the time is at hand and john to the servant of the churches which are in ages grace be unto you and peace from him and from which was in which is to come and from the seventh spirits which are before his throne and he from the spirit of of jesus which is which which were from jesus christ who is the faithful true witness the first and the and the first begotten of the dead the prince of the kingdom of his of of this earth which is which that loveth and with watched us from our sins i got a lot of things and i'm not law like you might think i am i'm i'm trying to find this uh what was revealed and in him that love us and washed us from our sins by his blood and who hath made us kings and priests with him in the in the father and the glory of the dominion and the power forever amen and so we know that he's the beginning and the end so we're going to talk a little bit about what our faith is anchored in so we know what was and what was in the beginning and what the beginning was god said that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and he created all things and all things were created by him so if we could catch just the way that it's on our heart there's things that are to be so uh our faith is a looking for the things that are to be right so our faith looks for what will be or what is hid and what is going to be revealed so if i we just just said on that that just for a moment so our faith is looking for the things that are to be so faith is the revelation of things hope for not yet things but what the things that will be so things to be so now so if we could look past the idea that my faith is i believe in the what was revealed or i believe in revelation and i believe like like like a doctrinal revelation i believe the things that were hidden i believe but faith moves past that because faith is looking for what the will of god for my life is so good not of faith just in the word so that's faith i believe in god's word i believe that he's got something for my life and we we begin to look what what is going to transpire and what is revealed what has been spoken that is going to transpire and what will those things be in my life shortly and so i'd like again if we just take a moment to look at this great thing in the as we understand what are the things that are to be what things that are to be and that's when i want to set my life in and my faith in and so he he speaks of these things and and uh and if we could look here in the uh the message things that are to be and if we could just go quickly to paragraph 22 uh and it says god was was in christ and was reconciled the world to himself and it was easy for those jews who had been taught through generations to believe that there was a great supernatural god and to think that god had come down and was manifesting himself through the person of his son jesus christ in the tavern that god tabernick tabernacled in the body of flesh and was was a little too much for them to understand and so here's somebody that's in the beginning and he said when you see my life ending my life is ending from the it's ending for a purpose that i'm going away to prepare a place for you that place place for you that where i am where you may be also jesus therefore is telling his disciples his life is not going it's not that his sabbath his life is not ending in death so it it it it goes beyond that so if his life wasn't ending in the death that his life had a purpose and now we could go over here and and he makes this a statement in paragraph 31. and this he says something beautiful thing and he says he says therefore we knew this is uh just the at the end of paragraph 28 he said therefore we we knew that jesus was gone to prepare a place and receive his people and those people who are in hope it's the thing that that those people tonight it isn't my friend that god made a way and a condition that you can that you can be included if you want to you are a free moral agent and you've got you act the way you wish to but if you notice now in this world is to come there is a world to come and like like your birth here [Music] i say you it was prepared god knew you would be here now when you when you even when you even things that your parents done people think that it isn't it's fitted from generation but it is now i want this reason i'm reading this because i want to say something that settles a little question that hangs over in the book of hebrews i believe in the seventh chapter speaking paul writing i believe it was was speaking on this great event that was to take place with abraham and he paid thai state to melchizedek when he was returning from the slaughter of the king and and now he said levi was in the loins of abraham and and meant abraham coming from the slaughter of the kings and he recognized levi paid ties when he was in the loins abraham this was his great grand father and he visits sins of people upon their children from generation to generation that won't keep his word now a lot of people get hung there because they are wondering does what my parents do is the evil that my parents done visited on to me and we look at that so many times as something that's personal and we sit back and say that is is it uh are the sins the sins of the this and he visits the sins of the people upon their children from generation to generation that won't uh keep his word but you got to remember in in romans 5 and 8 and i just want to hold look at that just so you can like there's a rest there um and it says in romans 5 and 8 but god can commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us amen so we we we he's talking about the reason this is visited upon their children because they didn't love god and the things that they do their children are brought up in those things and it appears that there's a judgment put upon him but this is what he says he says no it's not visited in that way because god so condemned this commanded his love towards us that while we were yet sinners he died for us and so when we go look at that a little further he makes this statement you were all pre you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned pre-planned many generations back for that you could be here tonight did you know that just think that you at one time uh and i'll repeat it again you at one time were in your father in a gene in your father and he didn't know you at that time neither did he know did you neither did you know him at that time but see you were in the bedding ground and and in the womb of mother the holy wedlock and then you became a person expressed in the image like your father was here like your father and then you and there was fellowship and so if if that's pre-planned i i want to just say something else before as we go on and this is in paragraph uh back in page 14 right at the end of paragraph 49 he says he says but the father knew that you would be here and prepared everything for you before you got here amen and first in your first your first coming here he had all everything ready for you when you got here isn't it marvelous think what he's done and he says now so when we begin to set our our faith there and we begin to realize that everything was uh pre-planned for us and that he prepared everything for us so if our life has been pre-planned and we've been predestinated and and so therefore there's got to be something that has been laid out for us that's be pre-planned for us there's a life that's prepared forth and so our faith isn't a faith that's built on survival and our faith is in a faith that's that built on trying to avoid hell our faith is looking for in others our faith is built that there's a revelation that our life has something that was pre-planned by god that i'm trying to find that's what i'm looking for that's what i'm trusting in that's what my my faith is because uh you know there's things that are to be i i'm i'm talking about so if i can i understand where i am in the lord i understand who that i am in the lord and then i understand that my life is pre-planned by the lord then why wouldn't my faith look for the will and the calling that i have okay so if i can start looking for that and and start sitting back and understanding my life is not and my faith isn't the faith of just oh i've got to keep his word like a commandment sure but how about if it comes to the place my life has to keep his word because i'm predestinated to keep his word i have a life that's going to keep his word he's using me and he's called me still because he's going to use me to prove his word and so it's not a negative standpoint like i'm missing something but it becomes a revelation in my heart to seek something i'm going to seek what his will was or i'm going to find it or even better than an empty search i have been called to find the will of the lord and i like this and you know and i thought this brought it out beautiful he said i i said any and this is in around paragraph 74 of things that are to be he said i said any minister that the word of god will will ruin ought to be ruined that's right certainly and he said well you're you're going to ruin it and he said and i said who is going to tell them you know in other words what people are telling people brother brahma you're going to ruin your ministry you know what i mean if you preach these things and these things you're going to ruin this ministry well he didn't really that man didn't understand that were the ministry of brotherhood he said he says i said well who's going to to tell to tell it then see somebody has got to say it somebody has got to stand for for that what's truth no matter what it who it hurts and friend as a christian as people i've to believe we're going to heaven and the holy spirit itself is a type to us in the word of god and he said i know what you he said i know what you ought to do he said people believe you to be a prophet said you ought to teach these women how to get gifts and prophesy and things like that and the great higher things instead of little things and i said how am i going to teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs when they won't even do the common things see the natural things how are you going to teach them high things you know and when you won't even start from from what we get on the if we won't even start from you want to get to the top of the ladder before you hit the first first wrong you know he said it that's the reason you fall he says beginning at the bottom and climbing up as god leads you up see you you see cope your life and ever and and follow every word bit of god's word god has ordained you to do it and so you know you know how can i say this to you but people think well i've got to reach these places in my life i've got to get to these different places like there's a part of christianity that you're going to earn or achieve a higher level of christianity if i fast more i do this more or if i you know it but if we would just understand that god's got a plan for our life he's he's already pre-planned our life he knows exactly how to get us there and he's going to lead us to it but if we could just understand that it's all settled it's pre-planned and i'm going to look for and he's going to lead me to what it is that he has from the beginning had in his mind for my life and and that's why this message is so far above religion it's the revelation of what god had in mind for you it becomes so personal it isn't a study of doctrines and principles and mysteries and and this but it is the revelation of the word but it's not the revelation of the word of something that's outside of you that's being shown to you it's a revelation of the understanding that you were in the thoughts of god he had a pre-planned life for you it's a redemption or right a redemption it's a coming back to her uh beginning to understand what you were in him in the beginning and so it doesn't become any more of finding out of doctrines and revelations and doctrines going to make me climb this ladder and have more faith no it's you were there already in him but he's now revealing things to us not the revelation until we know who we are but not the revelations going to give us some sort of how can i say it secret or some sort of method of working things but it's absolutely starting to build our faith that there is a pre-planned life for me i'm i'm it that's what i'm looking for i'm looking for what that i always was in him not a clone you know this thing that if we can all come to it nobody can come to what you are but you nobody can take your place nobody can it's not a revelation that i have that you have to get also it isn't a a teachings of brother branham that we can be real revelated to and then we can understand things that we never un understood before it's the revelation of jesus christ but i was in him from the beginning so i'm not looking for the uh to find out all about him that i can everything he was and and all that made him work and who he was in the beginning i'm trying to find out who i was in the beginning that's the plan i'm looking for i'm looking for the plan that he had for my life that i can manifest and be what he wanted me to be and it's here and it is in this word so it changes my faith faith is the evidence of things hoped for not yet seen it's a revelation and now i begin to understand that i'm not looking for power or deliverance if sickness is keeping me from seeing who i am then i don't want it then i want it defeated not only off of me but off of anybody else but when i can come to this understanding that that he's alpha and omega that he's the beginning and the end and and so i'm not looking for uh to try to obtain power healing power deliverance power the power to cast out devils i'm i'm that's not what it is that i'm trying to obtain i want to obtain what it is that he wants me to be what was it lord that you had with me in the beginning what fellowship did i have with you as he said well i was yet in the the father like he said you were a son you were in your father you didn't know him he didn't know you but you were there and then you could come and you could have fellowship with him as a father and son well that if it's that personal then it's not found in religion you understand what i'm trying to say it's not it's not found in a formula so if it was in the beginning and it it and then he says there are things to be the reason that they're going to be there is because he already spoke them right or he already made them and it can't fail and it was already pre-planned for the things that are going to be are the things that are pre-planned so if he had my life already pre-planned i don't want to look for something that doesn't pertain to me and it wasn't the plan that he had for my life so the things that are to be for me are the things that he planned for me and what effort could i try to put into trying to change the plan that god had for your life because i thought it was a pre-cloned plan in letter form and i could teach it the only thing we can teach is the word but you're going to receive the word according to the plan that's in you you understand what i'm saying if it's pre-planned you know like let's just say take cosmon and andrew what happens if i spend all my effort to try to get them to be great orators and have all knowledge and wisdom according to the scriptures and tried to put them in my school of revelation when what god's planned form was was to pray for the sick to have burden on their heart and to seek the face of the lord what god would have for them that were in need because that was his plan for their life and i was trying to unfold mysteries and and i was trying to create to have great teachings and and show them all the great depth light that's in god's word it would be of none effect they might be smart they might be revelated but they would be revelated in everything but what they should seek so we ask it a lot of times this way i we seek the will what's the will of god i'm going to seek the will of god but we don't look at it as it's beyond a will it's a plan and when i find the plan of god for my life i'm endued with power from on high when i find the word of god for my life i'm endued with power from on high because then i'm doing the will of my father and so eat god's made each of us as individuals he doesn't have big eyes or little ears and so when we begin to understand lord my i was in you in the beginning spoke your word you came and redeemed me my name is written on the lamb's book of life i'm i if i have eternal life i always had eternal life because i was a part of you what happens in my life if i could change what i'm seeking for and absolutely say seek and look for father what did you made me what talents or that not that we have talents or abilities but what was your plan for my life because all that he foreknew he justified and sanctified and glorified all that in him and he expressed begin to have particular attributes that identified what their will and their calling is so my heart's desire is that we don't look for the best word i have in my mind for it is clone to christianity but we seek after something that is unique for each of us but yet described in the word of god because as it's it's almost like one word but yet that one word produces many brethren in many different ways and many different attributes and many different forms and then we won't try to beat the people into one mind set or one work and then there's a freedom as the body grows one ladder at a time and is fitted and joined together so you say brother mcgeary isn't there just something one thing i can believe in believe in him believe in his word but his word is not creed dogma or letter his word is spirit and life [Music] think of it and this spirit and life was the light of men and if and all i i i don't know how just to express it and i've been just feeling but whatever it was he was and he spoke it and said let there be everything that god spoke will be so the things that are to be are the things that god spoke and if i was with him in the beginning then he spoke me i'm in the word the word doesn't stand without me i'm a part of it i was with him in the beginning i'm not trying to be redundant but i just want to say it right so what are you looking for i'm looking for me in him because that's what will be and it's there lord unfold it to me make it clear to me let me grow in it lead me into it don't let me judge let me go forward because i want to be everything that he wants me to be and i believe i am going to be exactly what he planned for me to be let us go with faith and peace so you can't make it work it's like a desire of your heart you can't produce it you'll bear it because you are his word you are his sheep and you are his attributes god bless you tonight amen brother billy hallelujah you should let y'all stand we've been made modern conquerors [Music] through the blood of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Music] jesus oh [Music] of is [Music] so [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music]
