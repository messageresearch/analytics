thing for me when I I look forward to this time when I can come and testify okay now this is something God has done I do not know who has to hear this testimony but but I know that God is going to touch someone today so by the grace of God one thing that I'm I feel myself truly blessed is when when you are surrounded by Elders by parents um that who are there to bless you along with the fellowship of brothers and sisters and I truly find myself very very fortunate that I am in the midst of bride it truly makes a big difference so by the grace of God my mom um who is here with with us in states she she God has added a one year in in her life and my mother-in-law who is there back home in India God has added year in her life as well so I give glory to God the testimony I'm going to give today is is uh what has happened in in the life of my mother-in-law back back in India so uh she was going through uh through this back pain and uh progressively was getting little more intense and um when she did go to doctor doctor did suggest I mean like a typical form of treatment XYZ you start with this and it doesn't go well we might have to do a little more aggressive and then final State we'll do surgery so as Dr laids out she comes back home started taking the medication so forth and so on but the pain was increasing day by day it was getting a little worse so um and it was coming to the point where she was not able to do her day-to-day activity uh walking bending down like a ideals like day to day activity one night she was reading a message and I believe it was the future home and at the end um uh and and no no way I'm glorifying my brother Bruno the glory I'm giving it to our one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so what happens is uh in that um prayer meeting brother Brennan is praying and um he points out to a lady and he says you who is sitting at the back uh in the corner you have a bone issue except your healing and my mother-in-law she says exactly same place right in the corner and at the back in the corner and at that time she as she was telling me I was like so encouraged and I says you know like I has to share this what happened was uh um it was I think 11 or 11 30 at night when she was reading that message so immediately she had this conversation with the Lord and she said Lord I do accept this blessing this is for me and she accept the blessing and as the biblical verse it says that when we pray that we must pray and believe that it has already happened and it shall come to pass she woke up I um and it happened like four or five weeks ago and uh she woke up next day the pain was absolutely gone and she was able to go to church that day and uh she she testified there and on behalf of her I'm testing mine here that our God is real all we have to do the only ingredient is we just have to believe God bless you all amen that's the work of the Lord and he does it with his own word and his own way he's Sovereign however he wants to do it we just we look forward to that amen I want to sing the song tonight that's why we praise him because we can see him in our life every day amen amen he came to live you live perfect [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] friends for today please [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why we [Music] sing and that's why we offer him [Music] crazy [Music]

[Music] [Music] amen you've surely being good to me [Music] surely don't get to me [Music] amen praise God that's a testimony all right man we're gonna invite brother Mark David to come and have a special at this time and also the Sunday School 10 to 12 ages are released at this time as brother Mark David comes in we're actually going to sing the same song we already sang which is coming down so a couple of weeks ago and I was just thinking because uh you know you go to the doctor and the doctor will say this is the diet that you should eat if you don't want to have this you don't want to have that don't eat this don't eat that don't eat that you know so in my mind you know I'm trying to follow that you know regimen okay I want to stay healthy you know I don't want that and most of the time you know we starve ourselves we wouldn't eat that and you know I was just thinking in my mind it's easy enough to you know do all these things but then the world when I look at the world look at even the phones that we have in our hand we eat so much out of the world that we get so full that we're unable to heat the word of God and so I sit down and I look at myself and that thing just kept condemning me and sometimes you know I just sneak up on my phone like when my kids would say that easy on your phone and you know and I just started talk that I guess that thing started talking to me you just eat so much from the world even just scrolling just looking at that yes you might not think it's a big deal but it just had it beating me up so much and so I started singing that song inside of me just out of the ring and say come on down come and eat from the Fountain of Life and you know sometimes I would say oh I want to do that and sometimes you just find yourself it's you say why is it hard for me to just eat from that let me I just want to eat that water and eat and get filled in the heat from this world so you know for the past couple of weeks that song would just come to my head coming down to master call it coming down so I was coming to the church this morning I even sang it out in a car and I told my wife is this how we sing it in church she said yes this is how we're saying it in church and so you sang the song today and I'm like I don't need to sing it again but I'm going to sing it one more time [Applause] Jesus has a tablespread where the saints of God are fed he invites his choosing people coming down oh it is [Music] come on come on down [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Master calling thank you [Music] let's come on down you may face that Jesus day we're on it down [Music] amen I always believe that you can never you can never out do a song you could sing it over and over and over and the more you sing it the more Revelation it has to it because it has the word of God inside of it amen hey man we don't have any new requests from this morning so we're just taking our ties and offerings they've come at this time if you have a need upon your heart if you have somebody on your heart that may be bad on his sickness or depression or whatever the devil might be throwing their way if it becomes a burden on your heart and you bring it before the Lord I know that he'll listen to the desire of your heart amen and that's not because we say so but that's because the word of God says so when we put our faith in that Amen brother clever if you just want to come and pray for the needs tonight after that we're just going to sing a verse and a chorus and we're going to invite brother Rafael Cabello or I'm sorry brother Joe kabet to come and say a testimony after that amen we thank you Lord for the opportunity to be in your house today Father you said we're ever two or three are gathered in my name I will be there and we thank you for your gracious presence with us Lord we thank you Father for the word this morning encouraging us Lord to continue to Feast of that word as you form the image and the picture and the puzzle that you had in mind Lord we pray even this afternoon as we get ready to partake of the communion Lord fulfilling that same picture which you told us to do and we pray may you prepare our hearts remove any sin that we may not recognize forgive our trespasses and help us to forgive one another Lord that you may be able to bless us that we may say Lord did not our hearts burn as he spoke to us along the way so we pray father even for the tithes and offering may you bless them and they may they go to the furtherance of your kingdom you pray for any unspoken need and even the ones mentioned from this morning may you continue to minister to each one in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] we say [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] that was [Music] [Applause] Jesus died let's take that course one more time [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] perfect guilty because I was inspired by our pastor buddy David when his testimony I give his testify here about uh when he was taking uh when he was in pain and taking pain like medicine for five times so I was sitting there in the corner and I know like I was going through something so that is how I got inspired went to to write this problem with my with the testimony of body David so in the February I was having some sort of belly pain like stomach pain and stomach burn and I don't know why it was it was getting termite me going and going on and so I thought it was just something simple but uh he stopped making me sound comfortable that's I couldn't even go for four or five hours without eating have to constantly keep eating and eating if I don't eat it was very very bad like he put me to wait uncomfortable even when I was at work I couldn't stand outside go outside every school too hard I had to have something important about something so I contacted my seven at something when when I start praying you know when you pray God always answer and he come to me and said hey you are healed you are not sick is that said all you are healed sometimes you hear all those things like they say look when you have that said that time was me I had it I said I was here so I I didn't stop there I keep questioning myself like what I'm Healed why if I keep hitting why if I'm here like it's not supposed to be fitting sorry the way up Beauty so one day I come here buddy David it was just like you know when somebody telling something like they don't listen and that's why I was here like I feel like it was just like you know somebody yelling at me like hey I told you hit so by David said you can go to a doctor and Doctor telling you you are sick but look the perfect picture the reality of what God's seeing you and that was me I feel like that was me God was talking to me so I went to see him after church like hey buddy David when he was talking I felt like that was me this morning it was just me and he just said hey Bay Hill I said amen and I walked home and I thought was fine and they keep telling me so I have to write my private care reference me to G I have to work for three months then why waiting for film I'm like you know what I'll give the time to God and I'll see what it's going to do and I'll pray for the doctor that will concert me because I went to different doctors that could know exactly what was going so I went to the doctor and he checked me and they find out like I always have H pylori that was like that was the bacteria that was making that into that so he prescribed me three antibiotic and another mate that was calm being the stomach burn and I came back home it was a lot I had to start taking full time a day and to me was just like waiting I have to start eating almost part-time every single time I take that I started taking one six a.m and going all the way down to 9 00 PM so that was too much then another problems tie again and I wasn't understanding why the problem happening and after urinating I would get tired I don't know why I was getting tired I'll get super tired and my how bouncing like very fast and I had to sit down who I have to it was just very bad but I know I was here but uh tell me about the time but maybe again spoke again like so many times you guys want quick quick results so I end up understanding like there is a difference between miracle and the healing Miracle when they pray for he can heal instantly but healing is the process like it coming up where God bring you to but at the end of the day you get healed so that's why my mind stopped body because I had that so I had a stomach problem and I have urinal problem that I don't know why it's coming then I keep placing it was just like I want to go to play a line I want to go this but there was something that kept coming up you know said hey if you have white attitude your permission comes the past and I said this is let me just reason why God told me because if I go looking for another person to pray for me I doubly so that wouldn't be good so I just tell where I was and I started taking medicine the face of face week I told my wife I have found medicine here there is one missing that letter j was you know everybody knows the name of Jesus by one side of medicine clean by Jesus healed I said this medicine will clean me but Jesus will heal me so I took all this medicine was the longest two weeks of my life I've never been such a fan getting tired I could not walk I would have like a mind body like if you walk the bike for because if I walk I'll get dizzy I could not stand for a long time I never know how I was walking but it was essentially like really bad so and while I was getting tired I was taking medicine I was playing taking medicine playing taking medicine playing I always fake every single time I take medicine I was playing I was playing four or five times a day and when I get tired I ask my wife to lay a hand on me to pray for me and that was keep going on in two weeks I decided to stop all the medicine even the one that they prescribing for us to take after six months and I stopped that medicine I was like no this is too much I have to stop when I went back to the doctor to check bike and it was her assistant and she looked me she's like there's something wrong I said what's going on it's like you lost weight you don't supposed to be losing weight like this it's like did you attend to love so I say no right in it I was actually healing four times I was like there's something wrong here it's like there is something you can go to colonoscopy it's one of other um that's that would put the camera in you to check your stomach I said no as I'm knowing about that because God healed me I took with five I took four and one was just so hit me so I went back home there was way too worried about me they said we're gonna send you to see this kind to check if it's something going on all this time I had the urine problem was kept going on that was like I started focus on like just making me uh terminate me so I went to check the CT scan didn't find anything so I was healed by for the stomach problem for the hearing problem so they sent me to her doctor I went to my doctor they won all the testicle they won every single test they never find anything so they looked me back a doctor looked me in my eyes say Joe there's nothing I can do for you you can hardly go home and hope things get better or you need to talk to somebody that was the time I I know who I talked to you know when you say you go to a doctor they're telling you they're gonna do anything for you but you stay sick and you realize you've been to that time I went back home it was not bothering me but I went back home I said I hold it up to somebody he knows what I'm going to now let's keep going on keep going and at that time I didn't have my bodies in your wedding I had to attend all this thing all the battle was going on I always had a lot of battle from them I didn't know them why not so one time I was sitting and by the one I was talking he said hey if you cannot move your hair hum you said I cannot move my arm I'm just waiting that I do it's not going to happen if he cannot move your arms side the more I'll move if we can not keep saying the next day okay I always been talking about it Darien by the intestinal morning hey how is going I said I've been just walking I don't know why I'm hogged I'm just walking after I read this the scripture have been just walking then I go to another different doctor I keep going to the doctor every single doctor doctor and I got tired suggesting a doctor I said and nobody want to say doctor cannot do anything for you so one time I had another appointment to go see a dog another doctor so I just sit myself I'm like you know what and that's why probably they cannot find anything so I just have to leave them alone and stay here in the wedding of my manifestation to happen and keep praying for my healing as soon as I just said that the Judgment stuff nah I start going to urine and coming back I was not getting tired anymore and now it's like getting when I get tired I'm like you know what I'm gonna go walk outside it's so exciting I'll see you if I'm going pass out outside let me just go walk outside let me take a walk then I will go walk I will go walk I'm like let me just next day I'll get tired the devil come up with me I'm like I get back through my couch I said you know what the next day I'm gonna go to the gym pass out again when I go to the gym I start working my hands shaking shaking I come back I think that I'll be fine I'll go back instead I'm Healed so if I if I fail I would say I only confess that people like I'm healing so we'll see what's going to happen when I went back again I keep hiking working out and nothing happened and everything goes away and my primary care was like we're gonna send you to reality you want to go I don't want to go but I want him again to confirm like I was healed when I went to the office I explained to him he looked at me like this he's like hey we just go home and we hope things get better exactly the same thing the other doctor told me it's about go to omohai and see if they'll find anything I went back home yeah but it didn't shake me a bit I know like I was here event I go back again they went to perform the MRI whatever they did and I come back again and didn't find anything I didn't know what happened I didn't know I was a sickness I don't know what I know God healed me I don't have that no more and I just want to thank God for that event amen you know the devil always tries to put fear in you and that's why healing is a process because you walk into those footsteps of healing by using the word of God thank you Lord for the testimony that we heard tonight that's just all stand as we just turn our hearts to the Lord and just invite our pastor by the ability to come out at this time but I'm no longer a Slave To Fear I'm a Child of God because now I have access to the promised land it's my inheritance and if the devil gives me something that's not of gods I can say take it back devil that's not mine I'm only supposed to inherit joy peace happiness all these things that God wants us to have but if it's fear it's not mind devil and you walk towards a vision of a perfect body that's the image that he wants us to walk into in an image that could transform us from this from this from this place let's just sing this house we're just invite her passionate about the ability to come to him you unravel me with the melody you surround me with the song of Deliverance for my enemies to all my fears [Music] I am a child I'm no longer [Music] slave to free I am a child good [Music] Ness [Applause] I've been born again [Music] if I am a child tonight oh and I'm no longer slave to feed [Music] always [Music] you rescue me and I won't stand oh and I'm no longer [Music] slave to feed I am a town [Music] I am a child of God amen you believe you're a child of God Amen one of the characteristics of the children of God is they have no fear they have no fear to what the devil can do why because they know whose father they are they know that they have the Heavenly Father God is their father therefore he has everything under control let's just buy our heads our gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered once again in your house Lord to hear the testimony coming out of your children Lord and father we come here we know that in each vessel represented in this room you are doing a work Lord and we may not see it we may not understand it but by faith and by the scripture we know that you are working everything for our good Lord you are the secret Gardener as of Pastor said this morning that you were behind and making all things all right and taking us out of circumstances and changing circumstances and situations some that we've gotten ourselves you come and pick us up and get us out and further you doing all that you can because your promise will not fail you are the same yesterday today and forever and we hear Lord to to just show our appreciation and our love to have a Gods such that you are oh God and one who never sleeps no Slumber he's at the work of his children and trying to do all that he can by his promise that he will bring them forth be with us we pray bless this communion service we're committed to you and we ask that you show us Grace once again for the few words we're going to say in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen it's good to be gathered once again in the house of God our communion service will try not to be too long um let's open our Bibles first scripture in Hebrews 13 verse 11. message for the bodies of those beasts it says whose blood is is brought into the sanctuary for the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that it might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gain let us forth he says let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for a year we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen let's also turn in Exodus chapter 3 we'll start from the first verse it says now Moses kept the flock of Jay through his uh his father-in-law the priest of median and uh he had led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of no God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in the flame of fire out of the midst of the of the uh Bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will go now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned now remember when he preaches the message Exodus he said his approach was very important because if he had just seen that and gone and said well this is amazing and and approach it with an intellectual side to go and take the leaf and said I'll take you to the lab and go examine it and see why it's not happening he would have missed it so so I want to say that the approach to the word of God and the promise is very important we don't approach it by intellect so we can learn and know things that we don't know we as our Pastor said this morning the approach is to learn and to come knowing that this is the word of God this is the promise that he has made if I come believing that this is God I'm going to get God's result but if I come thinking it's just intellect all I'll receive is intellect but if I come believing that it's God speaking to me then I will receive the reward and and so in verse 4 it says and when the Lord saw that he had turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and he said Moses Moses he said here I am here am I and he said draw not nigh Heather put off thy shoes from from off thy feet for the place whereof thou standeth is a Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard the Cry by reason of the Taskmaster and I know their sorrows so God knows what's going on he he there's nothing hid before him whatever is happening in your life he knows every details he he sees everything it says and the Lord said I surely have seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason of the Taskmaster and I know they're sorrowed and I've come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians he said and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land in the Lord and the large and unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanite Heights of the head sides of the amorites and the parasites parasites and of the hivites and of the genocides it says now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel has come unto me and I have also seen the of the oppression wherewith the Egyptian or Christ them it says come now therefore I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people to bring forth my my people the children of Israel out of Egypt let's just bow heads father we ask that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seeds we surely can say as you you you look at the world and you look at things around us one of the things we could be certain of is that here there's no continuing City that everything will come to an end you you look at Men's great invention you know in the computer World there was what was if you look at what they brought up to be the first computer it was amazing it seems like that was the end of it but yet years later man built something that was better than what they built before and you can look at in the nature but when I'm well speaking he said we we look at cities and we look at countries and no doubt we know that those cities are built on top of other cities that existed before you know men will cling to to try to keep their lives by exercise but whatever they can do and to try to live and and then as they get older they get feeble they get weak and then eventually they die you can look at uh when I even ask a question how can it be that men with such a great invention and great things that they do today but yet we have more diseases than we did before we have more sicknesses than what we had before we had more deaths than what we had before more hatred more everything but yet we are progress we are claiming to be progressing come on you look at nature itself will show you the the you you look at Seasons and there are more hurricane than they were before and more floods than they were before and you know I was telling my wife I said pretty soon we'll be paying wind Insurance because it seems like you know that's how it started how did people come to pay flood insurance well that thing never existed before unless until they looked and they noticed a pattern and then all of a sudden it became attached to insurance so we have a lot of wind that blows and I'm like I guarantee you in a couple of years time will be paying wind insurance it it just shows that nothing that men does will last forever and it's pointless when we take our efforts and put it into What man does and we look at even how we spend our time what we put our effort in and you you just have to look at it long enough uh perhaps not necessarily just your lifetime but just look at mankind history and realize that it will come to nothing the scripture says that all things that man does is Vanity it will give you pleasure for a season and then after that it's nothing you know you you'll think oh I like this you eat it you eat it and then just right after you finish eating it it becomes terrible you don't want to see it anymore why because it's not made to last forever and we can certainly say that the only thing that will last is the word of God uh the only thing that would produce a consistent result is the word of God if we truly are looking for a permanent City one that could be stand forever stand against every season stand against every uh obstacle stand against every wind and every flood or whatever the only city we can find is the city that's built by the word of God and it's not the word of God means mixed with men's you know like this we have today and we'll take a little bit of here and then mix it with our own intellect and come up with a product that we can easily consume that also will produce death because he has to be the pure word of God that will produce a pure group of people so as we read I I was thinking in light of even what our pastor spoke on uh this morning and and the things that has been spoken um the scripture says in Exodus chapter 6 and 1 it says then the Lord said unto Moses it says now shall thou thou see that I will what I will do to pharaoh it says for with a strong hand will I let them go and will with a strong hand shall I shall he drive them out of the land he says and God spoken to Moses saying unto him he says I am God I am the god I am the Lord it says and I have appeared unto Moses unto Isaac and unto Jacob it says by thy name God Almighty but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them and then he says and I have also established my Covenant with him to give them the land of Canaan the land of the pilgrimage wherewith there were there were strangers it says and I will also I will also hear I I have also hear the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Israelites kept in bondage and I have I remembered my Covenant now I want to say this and perhaps for just few minutes I know uh we we we have communion I want to speak on we are the people of Exodus we are the people of Exodus to to every Exodus there had to be a group of people that were called to that Exodus to every Exodus there had to be some prepared group of people that would hear the word and accept the word and walk into the word of God in order for them to experience what God was speaking and our Exodus is not us choosing God our Exodus is by promise our Exodus is by promise and it's there's a promise in the word of God for every season that a people has been living on Earth this uh we can look at the Bible and I want to say this as we read in Exodus this uh children of Israel there God made a promise to the Father Abraham and and if you read it you realize that this was before there was not even a thing as a nation of Israel before they can come on the same God is speaking to Abraham and he's saying that that your descendant or your children will be in bondage for 400 years and and afterwards I will bring them out with a mighty hand and and and and they were here because God gave a promise there were a people of a promise so it was a promise given to Abraham that your seed will go unto bondage therefore when they find themselves they were fulfilling the very promised that God made to Abraham and but God also promised that he will take them out of bondage by a mighty hand and bring them to a land that he had promised that he would give them the land that never belonged to them to begin with they didn't do anything to deserve it they didn't do anything to be good for it it was just God's word given to them so when we look at in the first Exodus it was God is giving this promise and it was for his own sake or because God knew that he he was to have a son come out of Abraham and the son was going to be a royal son and and he couldn't have him with the people in bondage that he knew that there was to go in bondage but he knew that the time will come when I will bring them out so I can fulfill the promise to say that out of Israel I called my son when God gives a promise it's not for us it's for his own sake we are beneficial of that promise we reap benefit of that promise but it's for his own sake what is the namesake means when you go read that word it means it's to protect one's reputation it's one acting in accordance with his re with his revealed character to uphold the honor of his Revelation so when God gives his Revelation it's not for us to wonder when he's going to happen is it really going to happen how is it no he who gave the promise he has a reputation to protect he has to have a Believer ready to receive the promise he has to have someone ready to perform that promise the way he said he would so we see in the first Exodus God who give a promise in the Genesis 15 12 and 14 it says and it says and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fall upon Abraham and lo and an aura and a great Darkness upon uh fell upon him and he said unto Abram he says no or surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them for them 400 years and then he says and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve I will judge and afterwards shall they come out with a great substance what is he doing God fulfilling his own promise God bringing a people a people that's not even represented on the face of the Earth yet but yet there was a promise for them let me say this we didn't come here by men's idea or by how we think we like the message this is the promise of God before you were even represented here on Earth there was a promise made in heaven that in the last day I will have a people upon the Earth that will bury my name they will bear my characteristics they will believe the message they will manifest the product of the message and I have given my promise and I will come to do it so in the second Exodus we we find out that it was after men fall in the Garden of Eden and God came in the garden and he said that the seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpent's head and the scripture would say in numbers 24 17-19 and said I have seen him I have seen him but not now I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him it says but not nigh they shall come a sore out of David out of Jacob and the scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of saith it says in the Edom shall be that a possession Seer shall be a possession for the enemy of Israel shall do vanishly and then he says out of Jacob shall come he Thou shalt have dominion and shall destroy him thy reigneth of the city in Psalms 2 and 79 and it says I will declare I will declare the decree the Lord it says has said unto me thou are my son this day I have begotten thee ask of me and shall I shall it says and I shall give Thee the hidden for for inheritance and the other most part of the year for that possession what was he this is a son before he's even born before Mary was on the picture before anything he's proclaiming that they shall come one for the second Exodus and it says I'll give you the ever the Earth for inheritance I'll give you all those things I the shelter shall be on thy hand and and ye shall possess all things and and then he says it gives all this promise he says Behold a child shall be given and uh one shall be given and the government shall be upon his shoulder but yet it's not even born what was he it was God speaking the words of Exodus before people can be even manifested on the face of the Earth so now we come down to the Third Exodus and I want to say this we know we are here by God's word that there was to be a promise for the Fulfillment of malachite 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 and 7 in this generation God promised that those things shall come to pass so just like he did in the first Exodus he did in the second Exodus we are here standing here or gathered here because those scriptures have been fulfilled in our time and the scripture says in John 14 and 20 it says and that day ye shall know that I as I am in them I am in my father now what is he saying and let me say this oftentimes we look at it or we think well I am in my father and my father and I now now he's telling us the same way that the father came and fulfilled his promise in the Sun the same way that I am in my father what was he he came from the father he was to go back in the father he was there and the father dwelt in him he says that in that day ye shall know what the unity of the father and I was because I and my father will come and dwell in you what is it it's the Exodus and let me say this the word of God is given to you and I to cause an exodus in our lives or when you receive the word I'm not talking about when you try to understand with your mind no when the word is receiving the heart when we come to church and the word is preached when you receive it in your heart it causes a separation it causes an exodus from the things that you find yourself is calling you to move out of the things that you are in into the things that God is calling you for it's not given for us to sit here and just debate and and talk and and and and and spew out the Revelation that we have received off of it it's given for an exodus it's given for a change it's given to call out it's given to cause a conflict and let me say when you receive the true word of God in your heart it causes a conflict something within your heart things that you should you you you used to love because you receive the word of God in your heart it starts to kick everything else out it starts to kick the last out and the love of the World Health and it says to keep that out and kick that out you find yourself the very things you used to enjoy you don't enjoy anymore why because you are in an exodus a conflict the word of God is a conflict creator it's not given to sympathize with the world it's not given so you can abide and and find a way to commingle it and have it there and have the world there now it's given to kick out the trash to kick out the things of the world and to take you and to pick you up out of automatic the mud and all the things and to place you as a son and the daughter of God to bring out the characteristics of one who's going somewhere so now people call by my name he said and he's doing it in the middle of Chaos is doing it in the middle of turmoil in the middle of sickness and depression and all kinds of things the word of God is their calling the word of God is there to bring you into the realization the way you're going the world cannot take you there where I'm calling you there's nothing in the world that can satisfy Our Calling where I'm trying to make you what I'm trying to make out of you you cannot get it by feeding into the things of the world the word of God proclaims that and I want to say this you cannot come in contact with that word and remain the same we can we can't truly with sincerity with everything within our hearts and and and come tonight or come day after day and come and receive the true word of God and Remains the Same every time you hear it it strikes your heart and it calls out for sins and it tells you about the land that you are growing in he the word is given to prepare you for the place that you are going it's putting you in preparation to the place through the location to the place where God is calling you to be yeah and I want to say this everything that happens in your life is for that one purpose I can't believe and this happened praise God you are an exodus person now remember I said yes there is no continual City because if we're not careful our effort and our Viewpoint of what's happening to us can be twisted you can look and and we put our effort and we try to build cities and all of that things that will crumble the scripture says store up your Stranger In Heaven A people of Exodus remember Abraham knew that it was a stranger in the pilgrim he never stayed one place where he thought it was his home he was always there waiting for God's instruction instruction for him to move to another place and the people of Exodus are in the same condition they hear the word of God and they hear and whatever is happening they put it in perspective with the word and they know that God is taking them somewhere let me say this but when I'm saying the message the Third Exodus he says now we've had many Exodus paragraph 55. we've had many Exodus of course but I'm speaking on the time that God called an exodus a separation from where they were at the present time here God is making ready to fulfill his Divine promised word and then he says that he might give to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and hundreds of years had passed but yet God never forgot his promise in its it says in the seasons the due season God always makes his promise right oh my brother my sister that that's the the foundation upon which we are built we we hear because God made a promise to us and and we know that there's one thing that God cannot do is to lie if God made a promise in the first Exodus and he brought it to pass if he made a promise in the second Exodus and he brought it to pass how much more is he obligated in the third accident to make a promise and to bring it to pass let me say this to you you are sitting here because you are a promised person and let me repeat that you are sitting here because you are someone who have received a promise if you didn't receive your promise you would have been out there you would have been in the world you would have never heard this message you hear it because there's a promise in here for you let me say this this promise protected your grandfather it protected your father it protected all of him why because you had to come and hear it when you were about to die the promise said this is not the time you have not come to it yet when something was about the promise was protecting you bringing you so you can be the recipient and let me say this no one can take your place if God wrote it for you you're gonna receive it [Music] we act like we are the ones seeking the promise and not realizing that the promise is hunting us he's protecting us walking us around and breaking away making a way why because the promises got your name on it and I want to say this regardless of the opposition now now I wonder why did God have to harden Pharaoh's heart just answer that question why did God have to harden pharah's heart he could have just said well I'll kill him you go and you get out I'll say I'll just live in the way no God wanted to turn up the heat he wanted to leave you without any doubt he wanted when we come in this end time generation when we pick up the scripture when we read about it we know we are serving a certain God who never fails in his promise who's the same yesterday today and forever when he speaks it happens yes oh yeah you know I I talked about myself being Moses I'm like God please don't you know just just give me the problem it's like no I need to raise up if you ever had someone who's trying to solve the problem for you but then he's raising up the heat and you're trying to beg him please don't just let's just finish it off it's like no I'll raise up the heat bring up the match oh hardness hard I'll have him do this I'll have him do that but then I'll show you what kind of God I am he wanted his promise without a shadow of a doubt he wanted when you receive his word you don't have to worry about nothing you don't have to question it you don't have to think it you just take it as it is and know he done it just like he did it with Moses just like he did it with Jesus he's here The Exodus does not start until God himself is on the same thank you you have communion so he says therefore you can rest assure now he he done the same thing with Abraham you know he he gave him a promise he tried Abraham for 25 years he gave him the promise and then Abraham was rejoicing on the promise then God tells him now I want you to kill the son 25 years and and now this I mean what he says God wanted to be double sure double sure is the word that he uses double sure all right what we have received has been tested it's won the victory it's already overcome what we have received is an overcoming word that we just need to apply it's true in every season every time every time it's coming it's won the victory and now don't forget the principle if he done it he's going to do it again now he says he wanted you to he wanted you to rest assure that what God has promised in the Bible is going to do it it says just no need of trying to think anything else or say well the prophet was maybe was wrong or could have happened this way that in this way look almost impossible and then he says and look how simple he does it he says I have come down I have heard the cry I remember my promise I've come down to do it he says I'm sending you he says you do it he says you do it I'm going to be with you certainly I'll be with you he says my never never failing present presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid I'm coming I'm coming down to deliver now God has come down why is he shaming you government God has come down what is he sending you because he needs a vessel he needs someone that will stand he needs someone to believe his word but when I'm says in the first Exodus that God came down he went in the form of a man when we take the God's words and we go it's us God going in the form of a man and I said I'm coming down to deliver he says I'm sure the spiritual mind catches it catches that see I'm sending you I'm sending you to bring my people to an exodus he says I says I called them out and I'll be with you but when I'm says what is he doing he's sending you the same way the father sent him how did the father understand them the father who sent them went in him other don't be afraid no I I want to say this you know and forgive me if my kind of mind is going too far I thought it's amazing you know yeah we are humans and we when God makes a promise and no doubt from our human mind it should be something that seems impossible right okay so God gives us Our Daily Bread how many believe it but some don't God gives us the very Breath of Life nobody can manufacture the breath but go out there ask how many believe that the Breath of Life they have is god-giving God gives us good health how many believe that so if God has to make you believe it has to do something for you it must be something that you cannot do something that's outside of your thinking realm right so yes obviously when he says it to you human you must look at it and say oh that's impossible right in other words it's not God because he's got God God's character he's only he has things he can do that no one else can do so when he comes and he says well I'll take you out of your bondage I'll take you out of your sin I'll take you out of your depression I'll take you out of the sin that's binding you obviously where you are you've tried all that you can you know it's impossible you know it's impossible but he looks at it on the god side he knows I have the power to do it and the reason he's doing is so you can know that he is God that's right the scripture says ask abundantly why do you go ask God things that a man can do so if we want to use this godship and and look at it for who he really is then we must have you we must be in expectations of things however many years we try we'll never get it he says he'll give you a body change he says he'll take you into Rapture so those are things that it doesn't matter how much we try we'll never figure it out so when we come to God he's the Creator when he does things how did he move Israel how he says out of Israel will I call my son he moves the world he changes circumstances brings War here that's not over here that that's God's attributes that's him so when it comes to your sicknesses and the doctors have said you can be healed you can be healed you can't be he says okay bring it to me I will show you who I am my characteristic is to date things that people cannot do and do it for you Hallelujah we don't believe it because we don't understand it I mean we believe it not because we understand it but we believe it because we know who promised and he specializes in things that you cannot do that no doctors can do no one else can offer that for you when you come to him he wants to show that it's God and he says he does things that no one else can man God bless you I know we have communion I don't want to go through [Applause] I feel like I've been sold sure [Applause] he must be getting at me for something I'm just getting excited isn't that the truth amen we've seen that song you know God Specializes in things thought impossible I like that double sure double sure amen just for you just think of that you know that's what he said in proving his word it didn't he said that God made the promise so now he had to predestinate somebody to be there that he could bring that promise to pass in for his name's sake and I I'll tell you I wrote that down I have to go preach this this weekend and I thought you know what I'm going to do I'm going to sit down and listen to Billy's tape and I'm going to try to practice that the best I can you know what I mean and uh that with the kick and and bring some of those things uh together but I I just think it's it's true at the end I there's just so much what he said there that just bubbles up inside of me because I I I just to give you a little something that's on my heart that because that we're going forward I've just got this thing burning in my heart about this running from the presence of the Lord and and this helped me put this thought together it hasn't matured in my heart but we know that our faith is in the presence of the Lord how many knows that that we say it's the the word of God but it's not this letter do you know what I mean it's not I believe that what this says you know what I mean because that's the intellect side but like our brother said tonight our our faith is in the fact that God is present with us to bring that to pass and so our faith is in in that presence and we we preach that here but I'm beginning to feel that that's what we're running from you know we're running because he said the reason that that that uh uh Jonah ran is because he didn't feel it would come to pass he was afraid just like what you said he was a he was afraid it wouldn't come to pass but God's got to make sure it comes to pass you know it's got to happen and and so we we keep talking about a Revival but we don't want a Revival inside these walls we want a Revival outside of these walls like the young man that brought his daughter up to church this morning he had the elbow she broke her elbow and and she seems to be well I I went to pray for her and I thought well where's the cast and it's something about the elbows not healing right and and I and I walked away I thought that girl don't have to have that operation there's something not right about that you know what I mean that of course you want to say I think she needs to get a second opinion but but that's where you want to see God you know and you got it you if if he brought you're right he'll go with you because that was the promise I'll be with you even in you till the end the works that I do shall you do also and even greater than these work because I go into my father right and so when all that can start to become a reality to us that just like he said like the god that we have is is there he's got to make those promises come to pass in somebody's life else their words they're just thoughts they're just written words and that's never what God's been it's always been the word of God made flesh the word of God made flesh so he was the word of God made flesh so we could be the word of God made flesh the most beautiful part about I guess and I can't say it that way because every part of brother Graham's Ministry is beautiful to me not just the words he preached and the revelations that he brought but it was that he was that mature first fruit that stood there and once again we saw the Lord Jesus manifested in flesh we saw what it was that Jesus did on Earth for us even though he suffered he suffered we have to suffer with them even though the prophet went through all collect he went through he had that love that compassion that faith in the word of God and it wasn't for him yeah and I I believe in if I'm mistaken forgive me but I believe when they kept brother Billy Paul tells the testimony about brother Branham in the car if he wanted him to do something and he made mention it wasn't for me and he took his hand over and he put it over on on sister media and God's buried her life see it was a life that was so lived for others you know be checked that shoe remember and he saw that man with the coat and he stayed on the platform for hours and even the very last part of his ministry he he he his he what he was preaching was it was preached out of so much love because the people were going into such a bondage okay and and and and being Carried Away by everything and maybe you don't know this in the church history but when brother Brown was preaching his ministry all the Full Gospel businessmen and all the doors that people were opening to they were all starting to turn towards Catherine Coleman you know what I mean and wanting what she was offering they wanted the new sensation on the Block and they were leaving the word of God and and yet he he's his call was because he wanted to get these people ready for a rapture amen this I'll say it again and I hope it sinks in this is not a staying message this is a leaving message the message and the word of God is not to prepare you how to cope with every day and how to live life down here and back and and how that God will build a hedge around you so you can live here easily so you've got all these preachers preaching about God's going to build a hedge and he's going to prosper you and you can bless you and you're you know you're going to have power and and all these great things and like this is going to be a great Invincible Army I don't want to be a great Invincible Army through the to through the tribulation I want to leave and here he's just he's just preaching you know it's it's it's getting ready to leave I'm getting ready to leave that's what what's going on we're getting ready to leave and he had all those things yet he had such that love and compassion to tell the people the truth and I think that's a a beautiful thing that God proved double proved his word that it's true he sent a message and he put something in you to receive it that you would know that what that you have will get you out of here you believe that with all your heart amen amen I guess the brothers would go prepare for communion and and uh we'll we'll turn in our scriptures in our Bible for communion service and trust that the Lord will be a blessing to us and uh so is everything ready Brothers for communion already so we're grateful for that let's go ahead and stand this evening doesn't that sermon like that just make you want to do something for God it really does it sets my heart on fire I want to I want to do something for the Lord what can I do for the Lord well do what he asks you to do go into all the world and preach the gospel Lay Your Hands on the set you say Brother David can sisters lay their hands on the sick certainly they can amen there's a way to do it a humble way to do it but you can take a sister by the the hand a sinner Girl by the hand you can tell them about the good things of God and God can certainly use you there's neither Bond or free male nor female Jew or Greek but we are all Christ's and Christ is God for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he is betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had slept saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this Duty as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup Ed Show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged let me read that again for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged what an attribute for communion what a time just to take an honest look at yourself and take an honest look at yourself repent in your heart discern your heart your modes and objectives make it right and then eat of that cup and drink it that that breath eat it that bread for when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set an order when I come amen let's press
