[25:42] this uh sunday morning i've asked

[25:49] share with you the direction that the
[25:51] lord's leading his life
[25:53] so he'll do that

[26:10] than anybody else we all know that he's
[26:13] leaving but we'll let him share that
[26:15] with you
[26:18] sunday morning but this these two
[26:21] statements came to my heart and i
[26:23] thought they were wonderful
[26:25] it says god has a time
[26:27] and a reason for that time
[26:31] to fulfill all his works
[26:34] god knows just exactly
[26:38] what he's going to do
[26:41] we don't
[26:43] we just have to receive it as he gives
[26:46] it to us
[26:48] but he knows
[26:50] and there's nothing going to go wrong
[26:53] with what
[26:54] he has planned to do
[26:58] aren't you glad of that
[27:00] now sometimes i don't know what in the
[27:01] world he's doing
[27:03] but i do know it's going to come out
[27:05] okay
[27:06] amen and he says
[27:09] there and he says it comes about
[27:12] there has
[27:13] to be sometimes rugged and hard things
[27:16] to only bring out the real true nature
[27:19] of the object
[27:21] he says and god sets a time
[27:25] and has a purpose for everything that he
[27:29] does
[27:30] there is nothing happens just
[27:32] accidentally
[27:34] to those who love the lord
[27:36] and are called according to his calling
[27:40] see
[27:41] we are predestinated
[27:43] and everything works just right
[27:47] for that
[27:48] because he cannot lie
[27:51] and he said that was so
[27:54] that everything has its time
[27:57] it's season and it has its way
[28:00] and god is behind
[28:02] every move
[28:04] and sometimes you think that everything
[28:06] is going wrong
[28:07] and it's up to us
[28:10] those things are just put upon us trials
[28:12] and wonderings and testings
[28:15] to see how we'll react
[28:17] on any action
[28:19] so we know that everything is perfectly
[28:23] set in order
[28:24] by god's plan
[28:26] you know i i don't
[28:29] know i'm going this sunday to a funeral
[28:32] of a friend of mine a very close friend
[28:36] in fact he was the brother that came
[28:38] with me here
[28:40] when we first came to fort worth
[28:43] for the very first time
[28:45] to try to get something started
[28:48] and i've been places with them and
[28:51] fished with them and lived with them and
[28:54] and this was the time that god chose to
[28:56] take him home
[28:58] this was the time that god
[29:01] chose to take
[29:02] darian's father home
[29:05] you know he's got this is the time he
[29:07] chose for rachel to get married this is
[29:10] the time he chases for every move
[29:13] we just got to trust in the fact
[29:16] that he's got a harmonious plan
[29:20] that everything works
[29:22] good
[29:23] so we don't have to get upset at
[29:25] anything

[35:21] a voice and said unto him
[35:23] blessing the womb that body and the
[35:27] perps
[35:28] which thou art stuck

[36:02] the past two minutes that brother david
[36:04] was up here he almost preached what i
[36:06] had in my heart tonight
[36:11] i almost felt like just closing my bible
[36:13] and saying well that's all i wanted to
[36:15] say
[36:17] god may god bless him richly
[36:22] uh the scriptures that we just read is
[36:24] eventually
[36:25] [Music]
[36:27] i want to title my little sermon tonight
[36:32] the forgotten beatitudes
[36:39] preached a sermon called forgotten
[36:40] beatitude
[36:43] [Music]
[36:44] and he took the scripture in matthew 11.
[36:52] and now tonight i will try to uh uh uh
[36:56] come up or add uh luke 11 in the
[36:59] attitude in luke 11.
[37:04] when we speak about beatitude the
[37:06] attitude
[37:13] the attitude speaks of it's a supreme
[37:15] blessing
[37:17] [Music]
[37:20] perfect
[37:22] in other places it speaks about it's a
[37:25] supreme blessing of the elected ones in
[37:28] paradise
[37:29] [Music]
[37:31] it's uh it's a perfect happiness
[37:38] it's a perfect state of satisfaction
[37:44] and jesus when he started his ministry
[37:48] we know that
[38:00] a
[38:02] portrait or on the wall that speaks
[38:05] about
[38:05] uh the sermon on the mount
[38:10] the scripture says jesus was on the
[38:11] mountain
[38:13] and the disciples came to him he called
[38:16] it
[38:27] that's when he started telling his
[38:28] disciples
[38:29] [Music]
[38:31] it says happy are those that are poor in
[38:33] spirit
[38:35] because they shall inherit the kingdom
[38:36] of god
[38:39] happy are those peacemakers
[38:43] because they shall be called sons of god
[38:58] that jesus was presenting to his
[39:00] disciples
[39:07] when you go to matthew chapter
[39:09] 11
[39:12] assembly
[39:16] he says he is a beatitude that seems to
[39:18] have gotten lost when jesus was bringing
[39:21] his sermon
[39:23] happy will you be
[39:26] sorry
[39:29] it says happy to him that i'm the or to
[39:31] one that i'm not a stumbling block
[39:34] all right
[39:36] the circumstances you have
[39:39] the circumstance under which jesus is
[39:42] presenting this beatitude
[39:45] when we go back to the bible
[39:50] you see it was concerning a great man of
[39:53] god
[39:54] a great
[40:01] it was one who was chosen to present our
[40:03] lord jesus
[40:05] when in his first coming series
[40:11] it was whom that jesus presented it says
[40:13] it was the greatest solution
[40:18] it was the one who received the holy
[40:20] ghost when he was still in his mother's
[40:22] womb
[40:34] ministry according to the plan that god
[40:36] had for him to fulfill it
[40:40] and as he had the spirit of elijah the
[40:43] foundation is speaking of faith
[40:46] says it's a spirit that doesn't
[40:48] compromise
[41:06] john the baptist was the same way when
[41:08] he came in front of errol
[41:14] and because of that john the baptist was
[41:16] put in prison
[41:19] when john the baptist found himself in
[41:21] the prison
[41:25] he began to think about a lot of things
[41:30] it was something that was enclosed to
[41:32] him
[41:34] it was dirty
[41:40] uh john the baptist began to think or
[41:42] reflect on his walk
[41:46] it comes to a time when uh most of us
[41:50] don't start
[41:51] in in our walk with the lord
[41:56] we find ourselves in certain
[41:57] difficulties
[41:59] situation
[42:01] we find ourselves in undesired
[42:03] circumstances
[42:06] we find ourselves in very hard trials
[42:13] where sometimes you don't even see the
[42:15] end of your trial
[42:18] and sometimes you begin to ask yourself
[42:20] questions
[42:22] [Music]
[42:25] is it really the fact that i believe
[42:27] this message was it true do i continue
[42:31] should i continue with the lord do i
[42:34] should continue me should i continue to
[42:36] love him
[42:39] brother david was saying a moment ago
[42:42] it was predestinated
[42:51] but when john the baptist found
[42:52] themselves in this situation
[43:04] his eyes of eagle view was coming down
[43:12] and he began to think about certain
[43:13] things he said certain
[43:15] he certainly asked himself
[43:17] [Music]
[43:19] that the messiah that i knew
[43:22] the messiah that i was supposed to
[43:24] present
[43:42] i'm wondering if he's doing anything to
[43:44] try to get me out
[43:47] was it him was it him that was supposed
[43:49] to come
[43:52] back
[43:54] john the baptist began to ask himself
[43:56] questions
[43:59] was he him was he the messiah
[44:03] it was god who showed him because
[44:11] it's the one on whom the spirit is going
[44:14] to descend as the dove
[44:17] he will be the messiah
[44:22] and john spoke with certitude voicing
[44:25] behold the lamb of god you ought to push
[44:28] it who takes away the sin of the world
[44:33] but when he finds himself in this trial
[44:37] his view or his eyesight was dead
[44:41] his faith came down
[44:44] his revelation was affected
[44:48] he sent his disciples i live versus
[44:51] jesus go to that jesus
[44:54] you say
[44:56] go to the one that i presented
[44:59] ask them a question
[45:04] was he really the ones that was supposed
[45:05] to come won't call no different
[45:08] or should we wait for another
[45:10] joy
[45:14] john came to a place where he was close
[45:16] to denying his own testimony
[45:20] denying what god did with him
[45:26] denying everything that god showed him
[45:31] because they find themselves in a
[45:32] difficult trial
[45:35] he sent his disciples
[45:38] when the disciple came to jesus
[45:42] jesus didn't provide arguments jesus
[45:47] jesus brought them back to a meeting
[45:51] jesus preached the word
[45:56] jesus showed what the word was talking
[45:59] about
[46:00] position
[46:02] jesus put the word in position
[46:07] and when the service was over
[46:10] jesus told them because your papa would
[46:12] be
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:40] sinners are saved
[46:45] that this word still has the power of
[46:48] transformation
[46:51] just go give him the testimony
[47:02] that's when jesus pronounces this
[47:04] beatitude
[47:08] happy to him
[47:11] that i'm not going to be a stumbling
[47:12] block for the
[47:14] one who's not offended in me
[47:20] in other words happy is he who's never
[47:24] gonna
[47:25] complain about being a christian
[47:36] happy is he who will find that my word
[47:40] doesn't have a place
[47:44] that's good because
[47:46] you connected
[47:48] god knows everything
[48:01] and because god predestinated us as his
[48:03] children
[48:14] that's why the bible tells us in the
[48:16] book of lamentation uh chapter 3
[48:24] is there anything that happened in the
[48:25] city unless the lord is the author of it
[48:32] isn't it by the desire of the the
[48:35] highest one that that all the things
[48:38] come
[48:42] and why is a man who lives why would he
[48:44] complain
[48:53] that man will complain
[48:56] about his own sin
[48:59] giant
[49:03] god is asking us to be happy in walking
[49:06] with him
[49:08] he says happy you are you it is
[49:13] even when we are persecuted
[49:17] i don't know even when people are gonna
[49:19] mark us
[49:23] sometimes they're gonna tell you
[49:26] what appearance you have
[49:31] but god tells us
[49:33] happy
[49:34] are we
[49:36] when they're gonna mark us
[49:39] but one of them says don't lie
[49:42] ephesians church age paragraph catholic
[49:45] uh paragraph 88
[49:56] secretary
[49:58] well didn't jesus say blessed are you
[50:01] when you are you are persecuted jesus
[50:03] said you shall be happy happy are you
[50:06] calling
[50:07] for when people are mocking you only a
[50:10] devil body instead of them uh are
[50:13] cursing you he'll push
[50:16] our belief they are moving god to come
[50:19] and bless you either
[50:21] benedict
[50:23] they are attracting god's blessing upon
[50:25] you
[50:28] the people in the bible with yourself
[50:33] we are putting ourselves in john's place
[50:38] this great man who who came and and
[50:40] presented the messiah
[50:44] but he could find himself in prison or
[50:46] fell
[50:47] where he is closed in by himself so
[50:50] with with no hope somehow the nouvelle
[50:54] with no news of the messiah that he just
[50:56] presented
[50:59] it was very dark for him
[51:02] but god was always there
[51:05] it called the disciples
[51:08] and when the disciples of john came to
[51:10] jesus
[51:11] christ
[51:19] jesus never said anything bad about the
[51:21] person
[51:24] he never said anything bad about john
[51:31] regardless of how dim his vision was it
[51:34] can
[51:45] who did you go and see it is john john
[51:49] malgresa vision regardless of a
[51:51] deep-sighted job more famous my brother
[51:54] my sister
[51:56] regardless of your dream sighted
[51:59] if you could do like regardless of the
[52:01] difficulties that you find yourself in
[52:03] future predestination
[52:06] if you are predestinated to be a son and
[52:08] a daughter
[52:12] jesus god is looking at you in the same
[52:14] position
[52:17] god is not looking at the testimonies of
[52:19] man
[52:22] god is not looking at what people are
[52:24] saying about you
[52:27] he's looking at what he's done for you
[52:39] he said john was the greatest of all the
[52:41] prophets
[52:44] and and and
[52:57] [Applause]
[53:06] and jesus is saying the same thing for
[53:08] every son and daughter of god
[53:11] whatever what he's telling us
[53:17] happy
[53:18] uh a happy are you
[53:20] that who's not offended in me
[53:25] that the word of god that jesus christ
[53:31] that it may not be something a stumbling
[53:33] block for you
[53:35] that we may find ourselves happy
[53:38] when they're gonna make fun of us
[53:54] it says
[54:03] but when the trouble set in
[54:27] and when the trouble set in jesus come
[54:29] and show the messiah
[54:31] showed the messiah he was the messiah
[54:34] but when something went wrong
[54:37] john had introduced the messiah with
[54:39] with with the fan
[54:41] in his hand
[54:43] going to burn up the shaft
[54:45] but he found out that the works of jesus
[54:49] he was meek and lowly
[54:51] so
[54:52] awarded irori he worried him he didn't
[54:55] know he didn't know what he what what to
[54:58] say
[54:59] he thought now there's something wrong
[55:02] here somewhere
[55:03] seem he had he had believed the wrong
[55:06] thing it seemed like it wasn't working
[55:09] right
[55:10] and there's many times that we think too
[55:13] we we think too
[55:15] it says that isn't working that isn't it
[55:17] isn't working right but it but it's
[55:19] working right amen
[55:22] and as long as we know that is here
[55:26] what difference does it make
[55:29] it's working right
[55:31] maybe it ain't working
[55:34] working it to the way that we think he
[55:37] ought to work it but it's working
[55:39] according to the way that god wants it
[55:42] to work
[55:45] sometimes we think it doesn't work
[55:50] because it's not working according to
[55:52] our understanding
[55:55] but god is in control
[55:59] it's working exactly how god wants it to
[56:02] work
[56:05] it's working according to the program of
[56:07] god
[56:09] it's working according to the plan of
[56:11] god
[56:13] but
[56:29] but to god it had to work that way for
[56:32] jesus
[56:34] for god he had to go in that direction
[56:39] and all that the devil does
[56:44] is to bring us to a place where we will
[56:46] doubt of god
[56:50] that's what he brought john the baptist
[56:52] to do
[56:54] he says
[56:55] i mean
[56:56] he's trying to bring us to doubt the
[56:58] word of god
[57:03] to doubt a portion of the scripture
[57:08] but the bible tells us
[57:10] that men shall not leave my bread alone
[57:14] but by every word
[57:20] not by all the word but by every word
[57:32] but the devil can bring us in certain
[57:34] circumstances
[57:41] this morning but when i was speaking
[57:42] about possessing the gates of your enemy
[57:50] he said that god has already brought us
[57:52] to the place where we could possess all
[57:54] the gates
[57:57] in the situation but he can bring us
[57:59] into a situation
[58:03] where everybody is against us
[58:08] even those that are close to us become
[58:10] against us
[58:14] it says in that time you have to stand
[58:17] sure
[58:22] he said he can let the devil do whatever
[58:25] he wants
[58:29] only he will ask him not to touch your
[58:32] life
[58:43] the purpose for the devil is to try to
[58:45] bring you in a circumstance where the
[58:47] word becomes a stumbling block
[58:52] that jesus may become an offense
[58:56] but jesus says
[59:01] are those that are not offended in me
[59:06] he says in the forgotten beatitude
[59:09] paragraph 41
[59:20] it says and i i i believe there are more
[59:23] people offended in jesus than any other
[59:26] person that ever lived on earth
[59:29] in so 52 raped they get offended too
[59:33] quick
[59:35] jesus no don't be attitude jesus now
[59:39] in this misplaced beatitude
[59:43] slipped over
[1:00:06] no matter what takes place
[1:00:14] everything is working right on schedule
[1:00:17] just go ahead and believe it
[1:00:21] that's all
[1:00:23] everything's all right
[1:00:26] continues
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:37] god is saying that everything is working
[1:00:39] according to the schedule
[1:00:54] in the most extreme difficulties
[1:00:58] like the three hebrew children
[1:01:02] he's gonna reveal himself as the fourth
[1:01:04] man in the fire
[1:01:16] he drives everything according to his
[1:01:18] program
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:23] all that he's asking us taking the
[1:01:25] swapper you know because of the shoot
[1:01:27] that he may be that he may he may not be
[1:01:30] an offense for us
[1:01:33] that the circumstances of life
[1:01:36] think it's jesus i know cause of the
[1:01:38] that they may not lead us to a
[1:01:40] place where jesus becomes an offense
[1:01:42] okay
[1:01:45] that this word becomes an offense this
[1:01:48] message becomes an offense for you
[1:01:50] that's a little
[1:01:53] that's the attitude of we read in
[1:01:55] matthew 11. mcconnell's a lord of mark
[1:01:58] don't look
[1:01:59] but when we got to luke 11.
[1:02:03] we have another beatitude
[1:02:09] and when you go and you read this book
[1:02:12] of luke this chapter
[1:02:18] you will see that in the beginning jesus
[1:02:20] is talking to his disciples showing them
[1:02:22] how to pray
[1:02:24] he showed them the prayer of our uh our
[1:02:26] father
[1:02:28] thou in heaven
[1:02:30] hospitality he spoke to them about
[1:02:32] hospitality
[1:02:38] he talked to them about god being one
[1:02:40] that provides to our needs
[1:02:45] that when we ask for something he will
[1:02:46] give it to us
[1:02:52] that it's wonderful that has that of uh
[1:02:55] have earthly fathers
[1:03:03] he showed them how demons can work into
[1:03:05] the people
[1:03:09] he said when someone believes the word
[1:03:13] he says that there is a demon that's
[1:03:15] cast out of that man
[1:03:19] but that demon will go and find seven
[1:03:21] more that are stronger than him
[1:03:23] that when they come back
[1:03:26] if the house is not filled by god
[1:03:31] he comes back and the situation is worse
[1:03:34] than it was before
[1:03:38] jesus was there carrying out his
[1:03:40] meetings wonderful
[1:03:49] the scripture says there was one who was
[1:03:51] mute
[1:03:53] jesus prayed for him
[1:03:55] and he was healed
[1:03:59] there was so much power to insert an
[1:04:02] assembly that a sister in the assembly
[1:04:05] come loose
[1:04:06] just like we are sitting here in church
[1:04:25] the womb that carried you
[1:04:28] he said blessed is the one that carried
[1:04:30] you and the perhaps that that suckered
[1:04:34] jesus didn't look at it
[1:04:37] jesus returned back to her
[1:04:41] it says a happy is more
[1:04:45] that those that hears the word
[1:04:48] and that does it
[1:04:52] and
[1:05:07] yeah not just to think of what god did
[1:05:09] yesterday
[1:05:14] but to know that that same god is
[1:05:16] present here present tense concealer
[1:05:19] delivered completely
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:48] and the one who keeps it
[1:05:51] the one who lives the word
[1:05:56] who doesn't just come and rejoice over
[1:05:58] the word
[1:06:00] it's wonderful to rejoice of the word
[1:06:15] only when we put in practice this word
[1:06:17] because
[1:06:20] when this word becomes our lies
[1:06:25] jesus says
[1:06:30] as he was
[1:06:33] so are we also are we supposed to be
[1:06:37] he said
[1:06:39] he said
[1:06:42] he's able to bring it to pass
[1:06:54] something that's holding us back
[1:06:57] on our side
[1:07:04] it wants to mean that it's for us to
[1:07:06] come more closer to him
[1:07:12] happy
[1:07:27] a preacher's
[1:07:28] uh story
[1:07:32] it's for every believer
[1:07:36] and even the preacher who stands behind
[1:07:38] the pulpit
[1:07:40] plus
[1:07:45] it's not higher than that an evil man
[1:07:48] who just uh a drunk man who just
[1:07:50] converted himself that the afternoon
[1:08:05] all this beatitude is concerning us
[1:08:22] that people will see christ in our life
[1:08:27] that's the word of god may be manifested
[1:08:35] that we may attract people to this word
[1:08:38] yes
[1:08:44] we live we've come to a time where
[1:08:46] people have difficulties believing the
[1:08:48] word of god
[1:08:53] and oftentimes it's because i started
[1:08:55] calling ourselves christians
[1:09:02] we are not coming to a place where we
[1:09:04] can clearly reflect this jesus christ in
[1:09:07] the world in our midst
[1:09:11] he says in a little bit well in a while
[1:09:13] the world will not see me anymore
[1:09:15] but you shall see me
[1:09:18] you shall see me
[1:09:20] because i'll be with you
[1:09:23] and even in you
[1:09:26] he promised
[1:09:29] that he was going to be in us
[1:09:32] and if it is in us he does a reflection
[1:09:34] he has to reflect himself he let him
[1:09:37] know if it's in us
[1:09:38] it doesn't present he has to present
[1:09:41] himself
[1:09:43] if he's in us
[1:09:45] the world has to see him
[1:09:55] in a message uh a blessing prophet
[1:10:14] i'm guilty of not doing the job of god
[1:10:18] like i should
[1:10:19] look like i should do i'm confessing it
[1:10:22] she shouldn't leave her i'm that i'm
[1:10:24] wrong

[1:10:41] the opportunities i have missed because
[1:10:44] of
[1:10:45] petty things

[1:22:09] [Music]
[1:22:17] [Music]
[1:22:25] wonderful just to
[1:22:26] i just marvel at how the holy ghost just
[1:22:29] come and
[1:22:30] deals with us like sons and daughters
[1:22:33] and builds us up and tells us who we are
[1:22:35] and then comes
[1:22:36] kind of spanks us a little bit
[1:22:38] he tells us hey you're predestinated
[1:22:40] you're elected everything's working out
[1:22:41] right on schedule everything's right on
[1:22:43] time but how many souls have you won
[1:22:47] and then to hear the prophet
[1:22:49] you know when you hear words like that
[1:22:51] it should cause a deep concern
[1:22:53] for us to look inwardly if
[1:22:55] you know the prophet's not just playing
[1:22:57] he means that
[1:22:58] he's being sincere he's being humble say
[1:23:00] lord i've only won a million souls i
[1:23:02] should have won 10 million by now
[1:23:04] that makes me say oh god
[1:23:07] 20 23 years
[1:23:09] serving you how many souls have i won
[1:23:11] look everyone say lord dig around the
[1:23:13] roots lord is that your hearts does our
[1:23:15] lord dig around the roots lord don't get
[1:23:17] fertilized lord
[1:23:19] i want to be fruitful lord jesus blessed
[1:23:21] is he
[1:23:22] who is not offended in me blessed is he
[1:23:24] who is not offended in the word made
[1:23:26] flesh
[1:23:27] i love what he said he said the devil
[1:23:28] wants to he wants to get you
[1:23:30] to a place that where you are offended
[1:23:32] by the word
[1:23:34] you know this just come to mind while
[1:23:36] the brother was ministering you know
[1:23:38] when when god gave brother branham that
[1:23:40] vision i believe was on december 22nd
[1:23:42] 1962 he was he had the vision of the
[1:23:44] constellation of angels and he come out
[1:23:46] of that vision he was reading romans 9
[1:23:48] 33.
[1:23:49] behold i lay in zion a stumbling block
[1:23:53] you know what it's a blessed is he who's
[1:23:54] not offended offended means a stumbling
[1:23:56] block behold i lay in zion a a stumbling
[1:23:59] block a rock of a fence but but he who
[1:24:01] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:24:04] and and he come out of that vision and
[1:24:06] he said why am i reading that it'd be
[1:24:07] strange that i'd be reading
[1:24:09] romans 9 33 coming out of that vision he
[1:24:11] said lord if that be you let me turn
[1:24:13] there again and sure enough he come
[1:24:14] right back there to romans 9 33 and it
[1:24:17] was coupled with that vision which was
[1:24:19] that third pull which was the unfolding
[1:24:21] of the word it it was the very revealing
[1:24:23] of christ what it was behold the lamb
[1:24:26] behold the lamb and blessed is he who is
[1:24:28] not offended in me and i love how the
[1:24:30] brother brought that out he he said you
[1:24:32] know uh
[1:24:34] in john's dim-sidedness it didn't change
[1:24:37] who he was
[1:24:38] oh can't you start to praise the lord
[1:24:40] many times we get dim sighted the eagle
[1:24:42] scales get on our eyes and we forget who
[1:24:44] we are but it doesn't change who you are
[1:24:49] jesus says just go tell john what this
[1:24:51] word is producing just go tell them what
[1:24:53] this message of the hour is producing
[1:24:55] just go tell them go tell my disciples
[1:24:58] he is risen he is alive and living in a
[1:25:01] people and then he proceeded to say no
[1:25:04] there wasn't a man
[1:25:06] born
[1:25:07] before or after like john and i believe
[1:25:10] god is looking down at you the bride of
[1:25:12] jesus christ say there's never a lady
[1:25:14] ever on the face of the earth like this
