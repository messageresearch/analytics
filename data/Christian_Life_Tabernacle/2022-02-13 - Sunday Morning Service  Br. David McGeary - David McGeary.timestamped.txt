[20:22] you as invited by mike this morning for
[20:24] our songwriting god bless you amen
[20:49] if you guys want to have a seat where
[20:51] brother david asked me to
[20:53] give you an update on the church uh
[20:56] construction project we'll just have a
[20:58] quick update there and then we'll go
[20:59] ahead and get right into the psalm
[21:02] as many of you know we've been embarked
[21:04] on a project for a number of years now
[21:06] to try to build a new facility next door
[21:08] here
[21:09] to accommodate more people to
[21:11] accommodate sunday school once again to
[21:13] provide a fellowship hall if possible
[21:16] and
[21:16] you know just we have a lot of needs and
[21:18] you know our goal is to try to build
[21:19] another building that look that'll
[21:21] accommodate that so it turns out there's
[21:23] a lot of work involved in doing that
[21:25] with the city and satisfying their
[21:27] requirements the requirements of the the
[21:29] neighbors around us
[21:31] to give you a quick update
[21:34] we've spent the last the better part of
[21:36] the last year working with the city
[21:38] working with a civil engineer
[21:40] to
[21:40] complete a design of what our property
[21:43] is going to look like it's called a
[21:44] civil plan
[21:45] and there's a lot of back and forth that
[21:47] goes on between the engineer between us
[21:49] between the city there's a lot of things
[21:51] the city is trying to figure out you
[21:53] know what does the drainage need to look
[21:54] like and you know some of their records
[21:56] have been out of date and you know
[21:57] there's there's updated ordinances in
[21:59] terms of what you need to do to support
[22:01] fire lanes and and to be able to
[22:03] accommodate fire trucks on the property
[22:05] and all of that you know takes time and
[22:07] so we've been going back and forth i
[22:08] think six different times we went back
[22:10] and forth over the course the last year
[22:12] as brother david announced on december
[22:14] 30th we did get the approval for our
[22:17] civil plan finally
[22:19] and so that kind of led us to being able
[22:21] to move forward with the next step which
[22:23] is really kind of two-fold you know the
[22:24] first thing we needed to do was get
[22:26] what's called a completed plat
[22:29] and what a plat is is it's basically a
[22:31] document a legal document and a design
[22:34] that that kind of records officially
[22:36] what your property is going to look like
[22:38] with that civil plan
[22:40] and i don't know if you know but the the
[22:42] property that we sit on with this
[22:44] existing building the property next door
[22:46] those have been two different pieces of
[22:47] property this property was owned to be
[22:49] used as a church that property next door
[22:52] was zoned really residential
[22:55] the intent was when the property was
[22:57] first you know
[22:58] titled that it was going to be zoned and
[23:00] used for residential so
[23:01] we had to get a special use permit with
[23:03] the city to be able to let us use that
[23:05] for parking to be able to let us use
[23:07] that for church activities
[23:09] that permit was getting close to
[23:10] expiring so this week we went to for the
[23:13] city asking for an extension of that
[23:15] permit which they approved
[23:17] uh which we're grateful for
[23:19] uh we also submitted to them a plat
[23:22] request which basically details what
[23:24] we're proposing that the combined
[23:26] property will be
[23:28] in terms of zoning it all as special use
[23:30] where all the easements are going to be
[23:32] where um you know what that design was
[23:34] going to look like they treat all this
[23:35] as a development we submitted a request
[23:37] for that this week and they also
[23:39] approved that so officially we'll be
[23:41] recording this as a combined property
[23:43] over the course of the next couple weeks
[23:45] our request for the special use permit
[23:47] now that the planning and zoning
[23:48] committee has approved that that's going
[23:50] to go ahead and go before the city
[23:51] council on march 8th so if you want to
[23:53] go ahead and keep that in prayer
[23:55] we were very fortunate this past week
[23:57] that we got no objections it was a
[23:58] unanimous approval
[24:00] we're going to get the unanimous
[24:01] recommendation of the planning and
[24:02] zoning committee so our prayer is is
[24:05] that on the 8th will at least get the
[24:07] special use permit approved so that for
[24:09] another year what that basically means
[24:11] is when you have a special use permit
[24:12] you have about a year to get a building
[24:14] permit in place and get started on your
[24:16] project and so we don't think it'll take
[24:18] that long but at least we'll have our
[24:20] bases covered in terms of of having the
[24:22] right permitting for that
[24:24] the next step is is we need to work with
[24:26] the um with the public works department
[24:28] to go ahead and create entrances to our
[24:30] parking lots our future parking lots
[24:32] from the street
[24:33] there's some grading work that has to be
[24:35] done that the city is requiring of us
[24:37] there's some initial drainage work that
[24:38] has to be done
[24:40] and of course utilities work which means
[24:41] we're going to have to you know we're
[24:43] going to have to get those make use of
[24:44] those easements to get utilities in
[24:46] place and you know there'll be a period
[24:48] of time we'll have to block off the
[24:49] street
[24:50] and that type of thing
[24:52] uh we're in the process of working with
[24:53] a series of contractors brother david's
[24:55] helping us with that to to go to the uh
[24:58] to get to the city and get permits to
[25:00] get those done
[25:01] it's uh in fact i already got a call
[25:03] from the city building manager that
[25:05] wants to set up a pre-construction
[25:06] meeting to start looking at that so
[25:08] focus well you'll start to see some work
[25:11] with the street and with the parking lot
[25:14] and grading on the property and whatnot
[25:16] i would say within the next few weeks
[25:17] that's our that's our hope and that's
[25:18] our prayer
[25:20] so wanted to share that with you that
[25:21] you would you would keep that in prayer
[25:24] once we satisfy the public works pieces
[25:26] of the property then we'll be in a
[25:28] position where we can ask the city for a
[25:30] building permit so that's kind of where
[25:32] we sit i wanted to share that with you
[25:34] brother david felt it was important that
[25:36] you guys got an update on the status of
[25:38] our project and we're nearing a point
[25:40] where you're going to begin to see some
[25:41] visible effects of all the the hard work
[25:44] so
[25:44] be keeping that in prayer and and that
[25:46] the lord will lead us you know as
[25:48] trustees leave brother david as a pastor
[25:50] uh to to do the right things and to
[25:53] spend money wisely and to
[25:55] to make sure that the needs of the
[25:57] church are met so hopefully that gives
[25:58] everyone an update there that
[26:00] certainly i'm welcomed i'm happy to
[26:02] answer any questions after service if
[26:03] you or any one of the trustees brother
[26:05] david feel free to come up to us and ask
[26:06] us we're happy to share whatever gory
[26:08] details you're interested in
[26:10] turns out it's a very uh very exhausting
[26:13] and very mind-numbing business but for
[26:15] those of you that are interested in such
[26:16] things we're happy to share more
[26:18] information
[26:19] with that
[26:20] if you guys would mind standing we'll go
[26:21] ahead and look at our psalm this morning
[26:25] i'm going to turn to psalm 43.
[26:32] just a very short psalm this morning
[26:37] you know the thing that sort of stuck
[26:38] out to me as i was reading that
[26:42] you know david asks say um
[26:45] he asks an important question
[26:48] in psalm 43.
[26:50] he kind of sets that up starting in
[26:52] verse one he says judge me o god and
[26:54] plead my cause against an ungodly nation
[26:58] o deliver me from the deceitful and
[27:00] unjust man
[27:02] for thou art the god of my strength why
[27:05] does thou cast me off
[27:08] why go i mourning because of the
[27:11] oppression of the enemy
[27:13] that's the question
[27:15] why go i'm mourning
[27:17] because of the oppression
[27:19] of the enemy
[27:21] it's a good question i think maybe to
[27:23] pause and ask ourselves
[27:26] you know david speaks of
[27:29] having a cause
[27:32] that is at odds with an ungodly nation
[27:36] you know he felt he found himself living
[27:38] in a place in a time
[27:41] when everyone
[27:42] around him the world around him
[27:45] was ungodly
[27:47] not like god
[27:50] that's what ungodly means not like god
[27:55] you know having attributes
[27:57] that are not
[27:58] god's attributes
[28:01] and he found himself living in a place
[28:04] where all around him
[28:05] were things not like god
[28:09] and i think that probably sounds
[28:10] familiar
[28:12] to most of us here in this room
[28:15] we know a little bit about what it's
[28:16] like
[28:18] to dwell
[28:19] in a time
[28:20] in a place in an age when everything
[28:23] around us
[28:24] all the messages all the attributes all
[28:26] the the campaigns and the
[28:29] causes and the things that are being
[28:30] said are all
[28:32] not like
[28:33] god
[28:36] you know what's interesting is
[28:39] this isn't about human agendas
[28:42] you know the world would i guess have
[28:43] you think that
[28:45] the struggle that we're in is against
[28:47] good and evil against what's a good
[28:49] cause and a bad cause against different
[28:51] ideologies against political parties
[28:53] whatever the case may be at the end of
[28:55] the day
[28:56] it's all ungodly
[28:59] none of it
[29:00] is like
[29:02] god
[29:05] you know david had a cause
[29:08] his was at odds
[29:10] with all that was not like
[29:13] god
[29:15] that means the attributes the
[29:17] characteristics
[29:18] the
[29:19] the the person the the the the character
[29:23] that he that was his cause
[29:25] was incompatible with
[29:28] what was around him
[29:32] you know it's
[29:33] first john
[29:35] has a familiar scripture it's first john
[29:38] chapter 2 verse 15 it says love not the
[29:40] world
[29:41] neither the things that are in the world
[29:44] if any man love the world the love of
[29:46] the father is not in him
[29:48] and this verse stuck out to me
[29:51] for all
[29:52] that is in the world
[29:55] the lust of the flesh
[29:57] what
[29:58] feels right
[30:00] the lust of the eyes
[30:02] what looks right
[30:05] and the pride of life
[30:07] sounds right
[30:10] is not
[30:11] of the father
[30:13] ungodly
[30:16] but is of the world
[30:19] and the world passeth away and the lust
[30:23] everything that
[30:24] seems right
[30:27] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[30:29] god abideth forever
[30:33] you know if he is your cause
[30:36] there truly will be a conflict
[30:39] between
[30:42] you
[30:42] and everything that is around you
[30:48] you know the conflict is between what's
[30:50] like god
[30:52] and what's not like god
[30:55] and there's constant pressure
[30:57] between the two
[31:00] and the thing is is you can't
[31:02] fake this
[31:05] sooner or later one
[31:07] will push out the other
[31:10] they're totally incompatible what is
[31:12] like god
[31:13] and what is not like god
[31:16] that's the pressure
[31:17] that's the oppression
[31:20] you know when david asks the question
[31:21] why go i mourning
[31:24] because of the oppression
[31:26] the pressure
[31:28] of the enemy
[31:31] you know that word mourning that's not
[31:32] the same
[31:33] as the hebrew word that you would use
[31:36] for example if you had the loss of a
[31:37] loved one
[31:38] and you went to mourn the death of
[31:40] someone or had a had a major loss in
[31:43] your family that's not the kind of
[31:45] mourning that this word is talking about
[31:49] this kind of morning is the hebrew word
[31:52] it's only used four times in the entire
[31:54] bible
[31:55] this particular hebrew word means to be
[31:57] troubled
[31:59] to be upset
[32:01] to be frustrated or stirred up
[32:05] not because you've lost something but
[32:07] because you're overwhelmed by the
[32:09] pressure
[32:11] every single time it's used
[32:13] it's about it's in results to being
[32:16] pressed from something externally
[32:19] why go i'm mourning because of the
[32:22] impression of the enemy
[32:25] why do i get upset why do i get stirred
[32:28] up why do i get frustrated why do i get
[32:31] why do i get trouble
[32:33] because of the pressure
[32:35] of the enemy
[32:37] you know it literally means to become
[32:40] ash covered or look like
[32:42] you're in mourning
[32:46] mourning not because of defeat
[32:49] but because of pressure of what is not
[32:52] like
[32:53] god
[32:54] you know and i think that that's an
[32:56] important question to ask ourselves
[32:59] we've all done it where we're surrounded
[33:01] by the pressure of the ungodly
[33:04] and we get frustrated
[33:06] and we get troubled
[33:08] and we get burdened
[33:10] and we moan
[33:12] and complain
[33:14] but david asks an important question
[33:16] here
[33:18] why go we mourning
[33:20] because of the oppression of the enemy i
[33:24] think that's an important reminder
[33:26] because there's an interesting statement
[33:28] that he makes
[33:30] what it is that jesus said it just
[33:32] dawned on me let not your hearts be
[33:33] troubled
[33:35] you believe in god believe also in me
[33:38] but david has an interesting answer to
[33:40] his own question here in this chapter
[33:44] verse 3 oh send out thy light and truth
[33:47] your word
[33:49] let them lead me
[33:51] let them bring me unto thy holy hill now
[33:53] notice what it says let them
[33:56] lead me
[33:59] you know it's really about what's
[34:00] leading you
[34:02] if the pressure
[34:04] of the ungodly
[34:06] causes you to respond
[34:09] with frustration
[34:11] and with trouble with a troubled
[34:13] manner
[34:14] and with moaning you're allowing that to
[34:17] lead you
[34:18] you're being influenced by that
[34:21] but david is let thy word lead me
[34:26] we have a different cause
[34:29] and to me this was an important reminder
[34:33] not to allow that pressure of what is
[34:36] ungodly
[34:37] to cause me to react in a way that would
[34:41] cause me to be led by that rather than
[34:44] his word
[34:46] because it says here that if you you
[34:48] know what that word does
[34:50] in verse 3 and 4 brings me unto thy holy
[34:53] hill and to thy tabernacles then will i
[34:56] go to the altar of my god
[35:00] that brings you back to the cause
[35:03] it brings you back to the place where he
[35:06] can be glorified
[35:08] whereas it says in first john
[35:10] he doeth he that doeth the will of god
[35:15] you know and as i was reading this short
[35:17] little song this morning to me it was
[35:19] just an important reminder not to let
[35:21] myself become troubled
[35:23] or frustrated
[35:25] or disturbed by the ungodly
[35:28] pressure that which is not like god
[35:32] but the reminder to allow his word
[35:35] to bring me back to the cause
[35:38] which is that he would be glorified
[35:41] in this final hour it's so important
[35:44] to pay attention to what is leading you
[35:48] what is influencing you
[35:50] and if the pressure of the ungodly is
[35:53] influencing us
[35:55] it's causing us to behave in a way that
[35:57] is led by the pressure
[36:00] rather than by the word
[36:02] so to me this short little psalm was
[36:04] just a an important reminder
[36:06] to not let the oppression of the enemy
[36:09] cause you to mourn
[36:12] let's just read that together
[36:14] five little verses starting in verse one
[36:16] judge me o god and plead my cause
[36:20] against an ungodly nation o deliver me
[36:23] from the deceitful and unjust man for
[36:26] thou art the god of my strength why does
[36:28] thou cast me off why go i mourning
[36:31] because of the oppression of the enemy
[36:34] oh send out thy light in thy truth let
[36:36] them lead me let them bring me unto thy
[36:39] holy hill and to thy tabernacles then
[36:42] will i go unto the altar of god unto god
[36:46] my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will
[36:49] i praise thee o god my god
[36:52] why art thou cast down o my soul and why
[36:55] art thou disquieted within me hope in
[36:58] god for i shall yet praise him who is
[37:01] the health of my countenance and my god
[37:04] amen
[37:11] amen
[37:12] god bless you may have your seats
[37:18] man let's sing that song count your
[37:20] blessings
[37:21] name them one by one
[37:32] oh
[37:40] [Music]

[46:39] pray for him so brother jackson is going
[46:41] to come out and give an update on the
[46:43] seating and pray for the request and
[46:45] then we'll uh the brothers that are
[46:46] taking the offerings he can come up to
[46:49] take the offerings amen
[46:56] i'm gonna make an announcement uh real
[46:58] quick um
[47:00] as you know when we do the youth
[47:01] services they just seem to generate a
[47:03] lot more visitors even than when we um
[47:06] have our normal meetings so we're gonna
[47:08] have probably about 60 young people here
[47:12] and then with that you have about 20
[47:14] drivers and chaperones so you're looking
[47:16] at about 80 people then we have 40 of
[47:18] our own young people so we're at a 120
[47:21] and then all the local helpers and the
[47:23] people assisting and people that are
[47:25] are housing people when we have a
[47:28] meeting like this we try to take in
[47:29] consideration all of those things so we
[47:31] really try to save the seating and
[47:33] sanctuary for those people that have
[47:34] been involved the whole weekend
[47:36] so just with that just don't be
[47:38] surprised be flexible it's one of those
[47:40] things where
[47:42] when you talk to the young people there
[47:43] there's really no other
[47:45] youth services where where a church is
[47:48] able to host all the young people and
[47:51] actually roll out the red carpet and all
[47:52] the expenses are paid so people enjoy
[47:54] coming here
[47:56] and with that that's why we try to save
[47:57] the sanctuary so when it's all said and
[47:59] done we normally have about 10 rows on
[48:01] this side and 10 rows on that side so
[48:03] you're left with maybe five full rows
[48:06] that are first come first serve so
[48:08] please just be sensitive that when you
[48:09] come next weekend on saturday especially
[48:12] sunday morning we already pack it out
[48:13] ourselves and then if you add 10 more
[48:15] rows on each sides of visitors
[48:18] it's really going to be busy so just
[48:19] know where we've set in the foyer we've
[48:22] set in the overflow and then sometimes
[48:23] we just get to a spot where we
[48:25] physically don't have a chair
[48:27] to put out so we'll have people sit in
[48:28] their cars and things like that so just
[48:30] be mindful of that
[48:32] but it is going to be a good time and
[48:34] then even his brother billy went over
[48:35] the prayer request you know as a as a
[48:37] young christian i used to think well god
[48:40] could just allow all of us to just never
[48:42] have an ailment never have a sickness
[48:43] never have a death never have a broken
[48:45] bone and you and you see these prayer
[48:47] requests that come out we know they're
[48:49] serious once amongst our mints but he
[48:51] says in his word he's giving us
[48:52] character and he's allowing these things
[48:54] to start to mold us and shape it and as
[48:56] time would uh i reflected back on a few
[48:59] pictures uh when i first started serving
[49:01] lord as time would start to tell the
[49:03] story you see that god is using all
[49:06] these events every sickness every prayer
[49:08] request everything to mold and shape his
[49:10] people and he has a purpose and we have
[49:12] confidence in his word and we would
[49:14] think maybe sometime with the snap of a
[49:15] finger we could just be delivered from
[49:17] these things but there's a reason why
[49:19] and then i believe when we're grounded
[49:20] in the word we're grounded the message
[49:22] he shows us this thing so if you guys
[49:24] would we just all stand i want to take
[49:26] these needs for the lord
[49:31] just let's pray together
[49:33] heavenly father we come to you right now
[49:35] lord
[49:36] brother billy went through a list of
[49:38] prayer requests and things that were
[49:39] mentioned lord and not just things that
[49:41] people would pin down lord but there are
[49:43] things that are serious lord there's
[49:45] ones that have passed away there's ones
[49:47] with cancers there's ones with broken
[49:49] bones there's ones that that even on the
[49:52] on the what we would say the positive
[49:53] side there's ones with
[49:55] new new life has come forth as one would
[49:57] pass away one would bring a new baby in
[50:00] lord and we see these sicknesses and we
[50:01] know that we could have a miracle lord
[50:03] you could use an instant miracle we've
[50:05] had that in our mid story we've had that
[50:07] amongst our brethren lord but we also
[50:09] know that sometimes you allow us to go
[50:11] through things you've never been
[50:12] blindsided or even as the enemy would
[50:14] come and he would put pain and pressure
[50:16] and he would put discomfort and he would
[50:18] allow things to happen in our life lord
[50:20] you were never blindsided you saw these
[50:23] things lord from the beginning to the
[50:24] end lord and you'll always see us
[50:26] through each one could come behind this
[50:28] pulpit now and testify of the things
[50:30] that you've done lord from an answered
[50:32] prayer request
[50:33] lord listening to a song to healing or
[50:35] even as brother dylan said within this
[50:37] hospital room lord you came and you were
[50:39] mindful here lord and we thank you for
[50:41] all those things lord and we just lift
[50:43] up your name on high lord we know that
[50:45] you love us we know that you allow
[50:47] circumstances we never want to forget
[50:49] that lord we lean on the brethren we
[50:51] lean on the ministry we lean on the
[50:53] tapes lord we lean on music father
[50:54] because we know that you can heal
[50:56] through all those things lord even today
[50:58] as brother david would come in what
[50:59] would be on his heart lord i pray that
[51:01] you would just speak to him lord he
[51:03] labors and he wants to he wants to be
[51:05] able to find where to lead the church as
[51:07] a true shepherd would lord in this sheep
[51:09] may we just be fed this morning
[51:11] the magical thing lord about your holy
[51:13] spirit is each person can have a need
[51:15] there can be 300 people here lord and
[51:17] you can walk down the aisle of each one
[51:19] and your word can discern the thoughts
[51:20] and intents of the heart you know what
[51:22] we have need of lord we're just
[51:24] committing this service into your hand

[51:32] loved ones that aren't here that should
[51:34] be here some that lord have wayward
[51:36] children all the things lord even ones

[57:09] minister to the people this morning
[57:12] father
[57:13] we ask that your
[57:15] this sunday school lesson
[57:17] would encourage their heart father
[57:20] lead them and guide them to their
[57:22] individual
[57:23] positions and places
[57:25] in you lord jesus and make us all more
[57:28] effectual
[57:30] in the ministering of the gospel
[57:32] we ask these things this morning in
[57:35] jesus precious and
[57:37] wonderful name we pray
[57:39] amen
[57:40] amen you love them this morning you may
[57:42] be seated this morning
[57:46] we certainly
[57:47] thank you musicians so we certainly
[57:50] love the lord
[57:52] i know it seems like we've had a lot of
[57:55] babies born here in the church in the
[57:57] last
[57:58] uh a few months and
[58:01] uh
[58:02] that we're so grateful for
[58:03] all the things that the lord are doing
[58:06] we've we've been studying
[58:08] uh
[58:09] through the year
[58:11] going through
[58:14] different sermons that
[58:16] brother branham had preached in plain
[58:18] portions of them
[58:20] and then going back over those portions
[58:22] and reading uh
[58:25] sections of them and the quotes and
[58:27] fellowshipping on those things and we'd
[58:30] like to pick that up again this morning
[58:33] so this won't be a
[58:36] revival meeting we have one of those
[58:38] coming up next week
[58:40] you know this will be sunday school
[58:43] this morning and just talking about the
[58:46] word of god
[58:48] laying hold of the things that were
[58:50] spoken to us and
[58:54] so we're going this morning to
[58:57] start in the
[58:59] message that's the next message
[59:01] on the path that we've been taking is
[59:03] called the rising of the sun
[59:06] and
[59:07] so if you do have your bibles
[59:12] he he reads
[59:14] three scriptures this morning
[59:17] one of them is found in revelations 1
[59:20] through 18
[59:22] and then
[59:24] and then he reads over in romans
[59:28] the and then he reads again in mark 16.
[59:33] so
[59:37] so when when he asked us to and he
[59:40] begins to read his text
[59:42] if you'd like to stand at that time
[59:45] and will stand for the reading of the
[59:48] text
[59:49] and then
[59:50] when he begins to talk about
[59:54] he says i want to take a text it is the
[59:56] rising of the sun
[59:58] then we can have our seats it's 22
[1:00:00] minutes and then we'll make some
[1:00:02] comments afterwards tonight is communion
[1:00:05] service uh we're not going to have uh
[1:00:07] much preaching at all tonight we're just
[1:00:10] going to go straight into communion
[1:00:12] and foot washing so the both services
[1:00:15] will balance out
[1:00:16] is that fair
[1:00:18] okay
[1:00:19] good so uh
[1:00:21] we're just going to do this now at this
[1:00:24] time
[1:00:25] and so that'll be our scripture reading
[1:00:27] and we'll listen to 22 minutes we'll
[1:00:29] make some comments
[1:00:32] this morning
[1:00:33] and
[1:00:35] a lot of this was inspired to me by
[1:00:38] the message that the brothers had for
[1:00:40] their men's breakfast
[1:00:42] which was harvest time
[1:00:44] and it was uh
[1:00:46] it was uh very good the points and
[1:00:49] things that have been brought out so
[1:00:52] this morning you know we always ask
[1:00:55] do you love the lord
[1:00:57] but sometimes we need to ask do you know
[1:01:00] the lord loves you
[1:01:02] do you know that he loves you do you
[1:01:05] know what you have so i really believe
[1:01:06] you'll enjoy
[1:01:08] this little segment
[1:01:10] it'll go by we're starting in paragraph
[1:01:12] eight
[1:01:13] uh it is the rising of the sun we took
[1:01:16] off the first
[1:01:17] uh three minutes and and then we're
[1:01:20] going to go to the end of
[1:01:22] paragraph uh
[1:01:24] uh
[1:01:27] 43
[1:01:28] and then
[1:01:30] and and that points where kind of
[1:01:31] brother brown changes
[1:01:33] uh subject so anyway lord richly bless
[1:01:36] you this morning
[1:01:38] i don't think of anything greater that a
[1:01:41] person could hear than the voice of god
[1:01:44] amen so lord richly bless you this
[1:01:46] morning as we fellowship on the things
[1:01:49] of the lord god bless you brother
[1:01:53] realizing that our time is
[1:01:55] limited here
[1:01:57] especially for those friends who are
[1:01:59] listening in by this telephone
[1:02:02] i would
[1:02:03] like to call your attention this morning
[1:02:06] to a
[1:02:08] a picture
[1:02:09] at some time a goal
[1:02:12] was taken by
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:17] camera
[1:02:18] of a vision that i had here at the
[1:02:21] tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona
[1:02:25] where i was to meet in a form of a
[1:02:27] pyramid
[1:02:28] seven angels
[1:02:31] not knowing what would happen
[1:02:33] later when i got there thinking it was
[1:02:35] the end of my life but no one could
[1:02:37] stand the blast and i'm sure all of you
[1:02:39] are acquainted with the story
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:44] then in sabinia canyon one morning like
[1:02:46] this while in prayer there had been a
[1:02:49] sword placed in my hand and said this is
[1:02:52] the word
[1:02:54] and
[1:02:55] the story of the word later the angels
[1:02:58] appeared as was prophesied
[1:03:01] and at the same time a great cluster of
[1:03:04] light left where i was standing and
[1:03:06] moved
[1:03:08] 30 miles high in the air
[1:03:11] and around the circle like the wings of
[1:03:13] the angels and drawed into the skies the
[1:03:16] shape of a pyramid
[1:03:18] in the same constellation of angels that
[1:03:21] appeared
[1:03:23] science took the picture all the way
[1:03:25] from mexico as it moved from northern
[1:03:28] arizona or the holy spirit said it would
[1:03:31] be standing 40 miles northeast of tucson
[1:03:34] and it went into the air and life
[1:03:36] magazine
[1:03:37] packed the pictures a mystic something
[1:03:40] way in the spheres where there could be
[1:03:42] no
[1:03:43] moisture where there can be no
[1:03:45] evaporations of anything 30 miles high
[1:03:48] and 27 miles across
[1:03:51] and
[1:03:52] coming right up from where those angels
[1:03:54] were
[1:03:55] now they asked to know science the
[1:03:59] one of them in tucson wanted to know any
[1:04:02] significance but i didn't tell them you
[1:04:04] all knew it told beforehand
[1:04:06] but
[1:04:07] it wasn't for them
[1:04:09] it was for you
[1:04:12] and so
[1:04:13] there he spoke to me and said
[1:04:16] the seven seals will be open the seven
[1:04:19] mystery seven-fold mystery of the bible
[1:04:22] has been closed up since the foundation
[1:04:25] of the world will be revealed and we
[1:04:27] yet a humble little group compared with
[1:04:29] all the world we've enjoyed
[1:04:32] these blessings now hearing those
[1:04:35] mysteries
[1:04:36] marriage divorce serpentines all these
[1:04:38] different questions has been completely
[1:04:42] revealed to us not by man but by god
[1:04:46] himself let's open those seven mysteries
[1:04:48] of what the church was how it was in
[1:04:51] christ at the beginning and how it would
[1:04:53] be revealed in the last days
[1:04:55] and now as this went up
[1:04:58] we have the picture outside on the
[1:05:00] plaque
[1:05:01] but then
[1:05:03] i have the picture laying present here
[1:05:06] if you notice as life magazine had it
[1:05:09] but
[1:05:11] i wonder if my
[1:05:13] audience visible here has ever really
[1:05:16] looked at the picture
[1:05:18] see
[1:05:19] and the way it should be you remember i
[1:05:23] was preaching when this vision came
[1:05:26] upon the subject of the
[1:05:28] book of the revelations were
[1:05:30] the old judges
[1:05:32] where we seen jesus in revelations 1
[1:05:35] when we started to open the seven seals
[1:05:37] of the or the church ages rather
[1:05:41] just prior to the opening of the seventh
[1:05:43] seal
[1:05:44] christ was standing with hair like wool
[1:05:47] white
[1:05:49] and i described that to you that the old
[1:05:52] english judges and judges of long ago
[1:05:54] when they went to the bench to be sworn
[1:05:57] in their supreme authority was given
[1:06:00] them they wore a white
[1:06:02] wig as it was over their heads to show
[1:06:05] their supreme authority
[1:06:08] well if you'll turn the picture like
[1:06:10] this and look
[1:06:11] you probably see it in the audience
[1:06:14] it's christ
[1:06:16] see his eyes looking here just as
[1:06:17] perfect as it could be
[1:06:19] wearing the white wig
[1:06:21] of supreme deity and judge of all
[1:06:24] heavens and earth
[1:06:26] can you see his eyes nose his mouth
[1:06:29] just turned the picture from this way
[1:06:31] they had it this way the way it's
[1:06:33] supposed to be
[1:06:34] and can you see it
[1:06:37] he is supreme judge there's none other
[1:06:40] but him
[1:06:42] and that is a perfect
[1:06:44] identification again a vindication
[1:06:48] this message is the truth
[1:06:53] and making him
[1:06:55] not a third person but the only person
[1:06:58] with the white
[1:06:59] so you see the darkness faces seared in
[1:07:02] his eyes and notice he's looking from
[1:07:05] him comes this light shining on the
[1:07:08] right hand side to which he's looking to
[1:07:11] on the cross that's where he looked to
[1:07:13] the right or he pardoned
[1:07:16] the sinner
[1:07:18] and the blight of his resurrection
[1:07:20] we still go forth in his name
[1:07:26] i wish this morning
[1:07:28] that i had just
[1:07:30] much time to
[1:07:32] to stand upon these phenomena
[1:07:34] that's beyond any shadow of doubt been
[1:07:38] proven for the past 30 years the 35
[1:07:41] years right here at this church that's
[1:07:43] down on the river when that same light
[1:07:46] came down here in jeffersonville in 1933
[1:07:49] and spoke those words
[1:07:51] as john the baptist was sent to forerun
[1:07:54] the first coming of christ your message
[1:07:56] will forerun the second
[1:07:58] we're at the end times
[1:08:00] and we see it we wonder sometimes why it
[1:08:02] hasn't spread over the earth
[1:08:04] maybe
[1:08:06] sometime we'll have a chance to explain
[1:08:08] that as god willing
[1:08:10] now
[1:08:11] i want you to turn in in your bibles as
[1:08:14] we always believe that the word must
[1:08:17] come first of the reading of the word i
[1:08:20] always read that because
[1:08:22] if my words is the word of a man it will
[1:08:25] fail but the word of god can never fail
[1:08:29] now
[1:08:31] we're going to to read from the holy
[1:08:34] scriptures a text
[1:08:36] and we want you to turn first
[1:08:40] uh to um
[1:08:42] three places in the bible
[1:08:44] that i have chosen to read from
[1:08:48] one of them is
[1:08:50] in
[1:08:50] revelation the first chapter
[1:08:54] and the
[1:08:55] 17th
[1:08:56] and 18th verse
[1:08:59] this is where he appeared
[1:09:02] with his hair white as wool
[1:09:06] and his feet was like brass
[1:09:09] and then i want you also to get in your
[1:09:11] bibles
[1:09:12] romans
[1:09:13] 8 11.
[1:09:15] i've chosen this morning three places to
[1:09:18] read from the holy scriptures
[1:09:21] for my message today that the lord is
[1:09:24] placed upon my heart for the
[1:09:25] resurrection
[1:09:27] and then i want you to also
[1:09:30] mark 16
[1:09:32] 1 and two there i will draw my
[1:09:36] my
[1:09:38] context
[1:09:40] now in revelations 1 18 we read these
[1:09:44] words 17 and 18.
[1:09:48] and when i saw him i fell at his feet as
[1:09:52] dead
[1:09:54] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:09:56] saying unto me
[1:09:58] fear
[1:09:59] not
[1:10:01] for i am the first and the last
[1:10:04] i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:10:09] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:13] and have the keys of death and hell
[1:10:19] and in romans the eighth chapter
[1:10:22] and the eleventh verse we read this
[1:10:26] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:10:30] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:10:34] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:10:37] shall also
[1:10:38] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:10:42] that dwelleth in you
[1:10:46] and now in mark the 16th chapter
[1:10:50] the chapter of the resurrection
[1:10:53] the 16th chapter the first and second
[1:10:57] verses
[1:11:00] and when the sabbath was passed
[1:11:03] mary
[1:11:04] magdalena
[1:11:06] the mother
[1:11:07] and mary the mother of gene and salome
[1:11:11] has
[1:11:13] brought sweet spices that they
[1:11:16] might come and anoint him and very early
[1:11:19] in the morning the first day of the week
[1:11:23] they came unto the sepulcher at the
[1:11:26] rising of the sun
[1:11:30] now
[1:11:31] my text this morning i want to take for
[1:11:34] a text
[1:11:36] it is the rising of the sun
[1:11:41] and for a subject
[1:11:43] i want to use
[1:11:46] the quickening power
[1:11:49] now
[1:11:52] you know you perhaps have been hearing
[1:11:54] the radio
[1:11:56] and the
[1:11:58] different ministers speaking our
[1:12:00] noble brother neville this morning
[1:12:02] speaking his
[1:12:04] easter subject
[1:12:06] uh on the resurrection
[1:12:10] and
[1:12:12] i thought maybe i would take it a a
[1:12:14] little different path
[1:12:17] not to be different but just to add a
[1:12:19] little
[1:12:20] more maybe in another angle
[1:12:24] or you the scriptures
[1:12:26] every angle you go with the scriptures
[1:12:30] it always declares jesus christ
[1:12:34] you cannot get away from it anyway
[1:12:36] it always declares him
[1:12:39] now
[1:12:40] as the world
[1:12:42] today in a
[1:12:44] a memorial service
[1:12:47] or at least in the united states and
[1:12:49] this side of the earth this morning
[1:12:51] and the churches and throughout
[1:12:53] uh celebrating
[1:12:55] a memorial of
[1:12:58] the greatest triumph
[1:13:00] that man ever
[1:13:03] i think as
[1:13:05] savior when he died
[1:13:08] or as an infant when he was born he
[1:13:11] could not
[1:13:12] have been your less being coming into
[1:13:15] the earth
[1:13:16] and when he died shortly he had thrown
[1:13:19] for our sins
[1:13:21] but yet there's been many
[1:13:24] fine little babies born
[1:13:28] and there's been many man who has
[1:13:30] suffered and died for a real cause
[1:13:34] but there never was one
[1:13:37] that could raise yourself up again
[1:13:40] until this day
[1:13:42] now that it is the greatest
[1:13:46] week in history
[1:13:48] the greatest celebration of all times
[1:13:51] this easter is where he proved
[1:13:55] what he had said
[1:13:57] man can say things but yet
[1:14:01] it isn't exactly can be
[1:14:03] believed upon thoroughly until it's been
[1:14:06] proved to be the truth
[1:14:09] and it's god who said prove all things
[1:14:12] hold path to that which is good
[1:14:15] he would not tell you to do something
[1:14:18] that he would not do himself
[1:14:21] so he proved
[1:14:24] who this was
[1:14:26] that died for our sins
[1:14:31] and now not only is it a memorial day
[1:14:35] of all these great easter flowers and
[1:14:39] easter bonnets and
[1:14:41] pink rabbits and so forth that we've got
[1:14:44] into
[1:14:45] and holy celebrations
[1:14:47] which is all right
[1:14:49] but this is not the real thing
[1:14:54] and that way
[1:14:56] as people today are trying to say we
[1:14:59] should wash feet once the year on
[1:15:02] on
[1:15:03] uh
[1:15:05] thursday
[1:15:07] and on friday we should take the
[1:15:09] communion and all different doctrines
[1:15:12] they argue about where they should be
[1:15:14] this day or that day or what should be a
[1:15:16] sabbath day or the first day of the week
[1:15:18] or
[1:15:19] all these things are just
[1:15:22] merely tradition
[1:15:25] what good would any of it do you whether
[1:15:28] you had lent or not limp
[1:15:31] if there's no life in you
[1:15:35] it's only a memorial which is nothing
[1:15:38] against it but they have
[1:15:40] certainly carried out their traditions
[1:15:43] but left off the main thing
[1:15:46] satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:15:50] or how right you are in your doctrine if
[1:15:53] you miss that life
[1:15:55] your won't come up anyhow
[1:15:59] no matter how religious how good
[1:16:01] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:16:04] belong to
[1:16:05] it doesn't matter one thing
[1:16:08] unless you have been born again
[1:16:11] therefore
[1:16:12] if god raised up jesus from the dead
[1:16:16] did he raise him up for a memorial and
[1:16:20] is this resurrection morning only uh
[1:16:23] uh one day in the year
[1:16:25] or certain day that we celebrate this
[1:16:28] are
[1:16:29] are we
[1:16:30] benefactors of his resurrection amen
[1:16:34] what does it mean to me
[1:16:37] what does it mean to you not we believe
[1:16:40] by faith that he raised from the dead
[1:16:44] but what has that got to do with me that
[1:16:48] was 2 000 years ago
[1:16:51] now to find this text
[1:16:54] as i
[1:16:55] was tired
[1:16:57] my arm hurting me from shots
[1:17:01] that the nurse gave me for
[1:17:03] leave overseas now as you know in a few
[1:17:05] days
[1:17:08] and i must
[1:17:10] have these shots standing on
[1:17:12] and with calories yellow fever and
[1:17:15] everything i was pretty weary making me
[1:17:18] sick
[1:17:18] which seizure requires to have these
[1:17:21] shots before you go into the other
[1:17:24] nation
[1:17:25] and he said give caesar that which is
[1:17:28] caesar
[1:17:29] but then give god that which is god
[1:17:33] and as i was sitting there wondering
[1:17:36] what would i speak to this waiting
[1:17:39] audience this morning
[1:17:41] which i'm very thankful for and men and
[1:17:45] women who would lay their life on the
[1:17:47] line for what you would say
[1:17:50] how should i do it what should i take
[1:17:53] for a text
[1:17:56] and then while i was sitting there
[1:17:58] almost
[1:17:59] asleep
[1:18:00] my door rattled
[1:18:03] out on the front side of the house
[1:18:06] nobody being there but myself
[1:18:08] as far as i knew
[1:18:10] i listened i didn't get it just right
[1:18:14] after a while
[1:18:15] the den room door where i have turned
[1:18:18] into my study
[1:18:20] it rattled
[1:18:21] and someone kept shaking the door
[1:18:24] i went to the door and opened the door
[1:18:28] and to my surprise
[1:18:31] a pretty little
[1:18:33] yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there
[1:18:36] uh
[1:18:37] looked like a little easter flower is
[1:18:40] sitting here looking at me now
[1:18:43] she
[1:18:43] handed me a card
[1:18:47] and it was the uh
[1:18:50] of course i guess when i get home
[1:18:51] they'll be easter cards and so forth but
[1:18:53] the only one being leaving home that i'd
[1:18:56] received
[1:18:58] and
[1:19:00] she said
[1:19:01] brother branham
[1:19:03] this is from
[1:19:04] daddy and me
[1:19:07] she want to be sure that me was in it
[1:19:11] and
[1:19:11] her arthritic father
[1:19:14] sitting in a wheelchair
[1:19:17] had sent
[1:19:18] this card
[1:19:20] when i took it and thanked the little
[1:19:24] darling as she turned
[1:19:27] and walked away from the door
[1:19:30] i opened up the card
[1:19:33] and in the farm
[1:19:35] of this card
[1:19:36] i drew my text
[1:19:39] for on the card
[1:19:41] was the saint
[1:19:43] mark 16
[1:19:45] 1-2
[1:19:47] sunup
[1:19:48] the sun was rising
[1:19:50] and then
[1:19:52] i thought of that and then the subject
[1:19:54] of
[1:19:55] the quickening
[1:19:57] of jesus christ to be raised up from the
[1:20:00] dead
[1:20:01] through
[1:20:02] my subjects
[1:20:04] now
[1:20:06] the sun
[1:20:08] at the rising of the sun
[1:20:12] well
[1:20:14] there was a time when the world was
[1:20:16] laying in utter darkness
[1:20:19] it was without storm
[1:20:21] and it was bought
[1:20:24] and it was all covered with water
[1:20:28] and was
[1:20:29] laying there
[1:20:31] in this
[1:20:32] dark dismal gloomy
[1:20:35] atmosphere
[1:20:37] and the spirit of god moved up on that
[1:20:40] water and said
[1:20:42] let there be light
[1:20:46] god had a reason to do that
[1:20:50] or down beneath that water
[1:20:53] there were seeds that he had planted
[1:20:57] and it had to have that sunlight to make
[1:21:01] it live
[1:21:04] and the first light was ever given in
[1:21:06] the earth
[1:21:07] was god's spoken word
[1:21:11] the first light that ever struck the
[1:21:13] earth was god's spoken word he said let
[1:21:16] there
[1:21:17] be light amen and there was light
[1:21:20] that turned darkness into light in order
[1:21:24] to bring forth a creation
[1:21:27] of joy
[1:21:29] and life upon the earth
[1:21:33] then the spirit of god as it moved with
[1:21:35] love and compassion at that great day
[1:21:38] the first day of the dawn of creation
[1:21:41] upon the earth
[1:21:44] the sun rose and swept across its rays
[1:21:47] and dried up
[1:21:49] the waters from the earth and made an
[1:21:51] atmosphere above
[1:21:54] and for its first time it was to bring
[1:21:57] joy and life to the earth by a seed
[1:22:00] that was a great
[1:22:02] hour
[1:22:04] but oh it wasn't nothing that's southern
[1:22:07] like the sunrise on that easter morning
[1:22:12] this time
[1:22:13] with the sun leaping into the skies
[1:22:17] it brought forth a greater sunrise than
[1:22:20] ever because
[1:22:22] it came
[1:22:23] greater news with this sunrise
[1:22:26] than it did with the sunrise
[1:22:28] at the beginning
[1:22:30] this sunrise brought a news
[1:22:33] that he is risen
[1:22:38] he is quickened from the dead as he's
[1:22:41] promised he's risen from the dead
[1:22:47] the first time the sun rose in genesis
[1:22:51] it was bringing a message that there
[1:22:53] will be life upon the earth mortal life
[1:22:56] but this time when the sun rose
[1:23:00] there was a
[1:23:01] a
[1:23:02] dual sun rising another sun rising it
[1:23:05] was a not only
[1:23:07] s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n
[1:23:11] had risen
[1:23:14] to bring eternal life to all god's
[1:23:17] promised
[1:23:18] scenes that before knowledge he'd seen
[1:23:21] laying upon the earth
[1:23:24] no more could the
[1:23:26] botany life live
[1:23:28] back there at the beginning without the
[1:23:30] s-u-n
[1:23:31] to bring it to life no more than today
[1:23:35] when
[1:23:35] sons of god is up on the earth it takes
[1:23:39] a s-o-n life to bring down to eternal
[1:23:42] life
[1:23:43] his chosen ones that he knew before the
[1:23:46] foundation of the world he had chosen
[1:23:49] them in himself
[1:23:51] before the foundation of the world on
[1:23:53] easter morning
[1:23:55] then in this dirt somewhere
[1:23:58] laid our bodies at that time
[1:24:02] for we are the dust of the earth
[1:24:05] and in heaven there was a book of memory
[1:24:09] and his attributes was in him knowing
[1:24:12] that they're called
[1:24:14] this son of god raised it would also
[1:24:17] raise the life every son that was poor
[1:24:20] ordained to this great time
[1:24:23] he knew it would be
[1:24:25] and what a more glorious sunrise that
[1:24:28] was than it was at the beginning at
[1:24:31] times when it first dawned
[1:24:37] a lot of stuff there
[1:24:39] amen isn't that wonderful
[1:24:41] amen so we're just going to
[1:24:45] just
[1:24:46] walk back over just a few paragraphs and
[1:24:49] and
[1:24:51] for
[1:24:52] you know
[1:24:53] for several reasons that we like to do
[1:24:56] this i think it's important for us to
[1:24:58] know
[1:24:59] what
[1:25:00] has been said
[1:25:02] and who said it
[1:25:04] so many times we hear somebody say
[1:25:07] brother branham said this and brother
[1:25:09] branham said that and brother brahm said
[1:25:11] this and
[1:25:12] you know
[1:25:13] for years
[1:25:14] when i first came into the message we
[1:25:17] didn't have all the tapes available to
[1:25:19] us
[1:25:20] there is no such thing as taking the
[1:25:22] message in your hand and pressing a few
[1:25:24] buttons if you wanted to hear something
[1:25:27] uh
[1:25:28] uh
[1:25:30] that brother random said
[1:25:32] you went and got
[1:25:33] a reel out somewhere you know and and
[1:25:36] you listened through it because you
[1:25:38] thought you heard it or you just
[1:25:40] recalled it
[1:25:42] by memory
[1:25:44] and
[1:25:45] in the early days i came into the
[1:25:47] message you know back in the
[1:25:50] late 60s beginning of 70
[1:25:52] and there wasn't a lot of books coming
[1:25:55] out
[1:25:56] and i remember every time that i would
[1:25:59] get a book it would just be like
[1:26:02] like a treasure you know i didn't have
[1:26:04] them all i mean
[1:26:05] and we just go through it we'd read and
[1:26:07] we'd see things in it and it and it was
[1:26:10] rich
[1:26:11] but there were so many things said that
[1:26:13] weren't really said the way that he said
[1:26:16] it
[1:26:18] and it's natural for humanism to come in
[1:26:22] and we don't fault us
[1:26:25] for that
[1:26:26] but i found out there was many things
[1:26:28] that i said that he said that he never
[1:26:31] said
[1:26:34] you know and uh
[1:26:37] and it's kind of uh
[1:26:39] uh
[1:26:40] comes pretty straightforward when all of
[1:26:42] a sudden you hear it from him
[1:26:45] and i and uh i know there's an
[1:26:47] expression you know i like to get it
[1:26:49] straight from the eagle's mouth
[1:26:54] you know what i'm saying so
[1:26:56] that's why that we listen
[1:26:58] but also i like to do this because
[1:27:01] so many times we'll listen to a tape and
[1:27:04] we'll get get caught up in the
[1:27:07] the general subject
[1:27:10] you know what was the message about
[1:27:13] you know it was about quickening power
[1:27:16] but then we missed so many of the
[1:27:18] nuggets that were laid in there so many
[1:27:20] of the things that he alluded to
[1:27:23] how how many little of uh
[1:27:26] building blocks that he laid down for a
[1:27:28] foundation that we could build on later
[1:27:32] because no greater foundation can any
[1:27:34] man lay other than the word of god which
[1:27:37] is christ
[1:27:39] and so you get those things and they
[1:27:41] become principles they become things
[1:27:44] that you can count on
[1:27:46] one of the things brother graham always
[1:27:48] said that struck me and i know you've
[1:27:50] heard this
[1:27:52] he said that if god ever does one thing
[1:27:55] one way he continues to do that
[1:27:58] continually the same way
[1:28:01] but he can't come up with anything
[1:28:03] better
[1:28:05] remember last word week he said man they
[1:28:08] started with a club and a stick and went
[1:28:10] to a bow and arrow because they had
[1:28:12] danced he said but god gave us the atom
[1:28:15] bomb right from the beginning he gave us
[1:28:18] the best weapon that we could have
[1:28:21] and
[1:28:22] uh
[1:28:23] and so we we find out there's a lot of
[1:28:27] things that are sad but you've got to
[1:28:31] to know
[1:28:32] uh for yourself and so i feel that
[1:28:36] i i'm not interested in having any
[1:28:39] ministry of my own i wouldn't have a
[1:28:41] ministry if it wasn't for this message
[1:28:45] i mean you know what i'm saying i know a
[1:28:47] lot of guys study and see if they could
[1:28:49] come up with something new
[1:28:51] but i i have a divine revelation in my
[1:28:54] heart that the mysteries of god have
[1:28:56] been revealed
[1:28:58] you know i'm not looking for something
[1:29:01] new i'm not looking for something to
[1:29:04] break i'm not looking for something
[1:29:06] that's going to give me the key
[1:29:09] or open the door for me
[1:29:12] i believe that it's been stored up for
[1:29:14] me and that i can feast on the word of
[1:29:17] god so let's just go back and
[1:29:20] there's a few paragraphs that
[1:29:23] that stood out for me
[1:29:26] and
[1:29:27] the first paragraph was
[1:29:30] paragraph 11
[1:29:32] and
[1:29:34] and i'm not taking
[1:29:36] or making light of any of the other
[1:29:39] things that were spoken
[1:29:41] or
[1:29:43] or leaving anything out
[1:29:45] because we could go through this message
[1:29:48] and then come back again
[1:29:51] two weeks or three weeks and listen to
[1:29:53] it again and have more of the word of
[1:29:56] god unfold
[1:29:58] and and each of you in here is a
[1:30:00] christian you started out and went to
[1:30:03] school and
[1:30:04] and and they taught you math and then as
[1:30:07] you grew and you understood that math
[1:30:09] they advanced you to something else and
[1:30:12] you learned something else and
[1:30:14] and uh
[1:30:15] uh and so you grew well well you know
[1:30:19] we're uh
[1:30:20] we're a young congregation
[1:30:23] most of us have come to the message
[1:30:24] after the messenger was here
[1:30:27] and and and we're learning we're from
[1:30:30] many different uh
[1:30:32] times of birth some have been in the
[1:30:34] message five years 10 years 15 years
[1:30:37] different ones so we're all coming
[1:30:39] together and we all learn together the
[1:30:42] greatest thing in our thing though is
[1:30:44] that we all learn from the same book
[1:30:47] amen the book of life
[1:30:50] and so i like this in this
[1:30:52] question because the prophet of god just
[1:30:55] again as we saw that he explained we
[1:30:57] have it here on the wall he explained
[1:31:00] about
[1:31:01] the vision that he had and how he saw
[1:31:04] these things and
[1:31:06] and then when this cloud appeared i
[1:31:09] liked how he described it
[1:31:11] he said it was a picture of the vision i
[1:31:13] had
[1:31:16] you know and and so it it he he was
[1:31:19] wondering and he told us in services
[1:31:22] this the time and he said you know life
[1:31:24] magazine had it this way but he said if
[1:31:28] but if you're looking up at it he said
[1:31:30] if you turn it this way you can see the
[1:31:33] image and the face of the lord and we
[1:31:35] can look at that and the white wig
[1:31:38] and how that he spoke it
[1:31:40] and he makes this statement because i
[1:31:43] find out that there's little things that
[1:31:45] brother branham says
[1:31:46] that only we hear
[1:31:51] you you understand that that it goes
[1:31:54] right over the top of of people's heads
[1:31:58] and
[1:31:59] and i i looked as i was looking at i was
[1:32:03] listening some statements that the
[1:32:05] prophet of god had made
[1:32:07] and i was on youtube and this other guy
[1:32:09] came up and he started trying to explain
[1:32:13] that when brother brahm said he saw that
[1:32:15] table go up and down he was trying to
[1:32:17] explain that was just a memory
[1:32:21] from brother branham being a a kid
[1:32:24] or something you know can and i i just
[1:32:27] sat back and i thought you know
[1:32:30] uh
[1:32:32] i guess that you could say whatever you
[1:32:34] want to say
[1:32:36] but brother bram just said here he says
[1:32:38] this proved what he was talking about
[1:32:43] do you know what i mean so
[1:32:45] if a guy could do the same works that he
[1:32:48] did if he could do the same signs and
[1:32:50] wonders if he could turn his back to the
[1:32:53] audience and discerned the thoughts and
[1:32:55] intents of the heart and there's
[1:32:57] thousands of people that witnessed that
[1:33:01] i've heard testimonies from many many
[1:33:04] people in this in this city that have
[1:33:07] seen and heard and listened to the
[1:33:10] prophet of god
[1:33:12] you could you cannot believe how many
[1:33:14] denominational
[1:33:16] and independent ministers that don't
[1:33:19] believe this message have been quoting
[1:33:22] brother branham's visions
[1:33:25] over and over and over again they don't
[1:33:28] believe who that he is
[1:33:32] but yet there's so many things that he
[1:33:35] said that they can't deny
[1:33:38] but he makes this statement here he says
[1:33:41] now they asked
[1:33:43] to know
[1:33:44] science the
[1:33:46] one of them in tucson
[1:33:48] wanted to know any significance but i
[1:33:52] didn't tell them
[1:33:55] you all know it
[1:33:58] told you
[1:33:59] beforehand
[1:34:02] but it wasn't for them it was for you
[1:34:07] now when i see that statement
[1:34:11] i think why does a prophet of god
[1:34:13] prelude a message that he's fixing to
[1:34:17] preach and say it's for you
[1:34:20] because maybe there's something in there
[1:34:23] for me
[1:34:26] and he didn't say for us
[1:34:29] he didn't say you all he made it very
[1:34:32] personal
[1:34:35] it's for you
[1:34:36] it's for you it's for me
[1:34:40] and and so we can
[1:34:43] we can sit there and we can rest on this
[1:34:46] great thing that there's something that
[1:34:48] was hid and opened up in those seals
[1:34:52] that was for us
[1:34:55] the mysteries that was open another it
[1:34:58] goes back to it it was something that
[1:35:01] was elected
[1:35:03] and so let's read this next paragraph
[1:35:05] because i i really
[1:35:08] it blessed me and there was so much said
[1:35:10] in that
[1:35:13] that it's so quick just to breathe
[1:35:15] through it
[1:35:17] he says so
[1:35:18] so there he spoke to me
[1:35:23] and said
[1:35:25] the seven seals will be opened
[1:35:30] the seven mysteries
[1:35:33] the seven-fold mysteries of the bible
[1:35:37] that's been closed up
[1:35:40] since the foundation of
[1:35:43] the world
[1:35:45] well how significant
[1:35:48] is this to us
[1:35:49] that we live in a day
[1:35:52] when mysteries that were sealed up from
[1:35:56] the foundation of the beginning of the
[1:35:59] world are going to be revealed
[1:36:04] now i wonder if we sit back and realize
[1:36:07] the phenomena
[1:36:09] and the power of what's transpiring
[1:36:12] because men have been poking out
[1:36:14] mysteries and trying to figure out the
[1:36:16] bible since the foundation of the world
[1:36:19] and what do we got 900 different ideas
[1:36:22] 900 different approaches 900 different
[1:36:25] ways to worship 900 different ideas and
[1:36:29] everybody's fighting one another to try
[1:36:32] to get their influence and collect their
[1:36:34] dollar
[1:36:38] but he said from the foundation of the
[1:36:41] world
[1:36:42] will be
[1:36:43] revealed
[1:36:45] a revelation is something that's
[1:36:46] previously hid and now made known
[1:36:50] that perks my attention
[1:36:54] there's something that you're going to
[1:36:56] know
[1:36:59] that
[1:37:00] believers have wanted to know since the
[1:37:03] foundation of the world how much do we
[1:37:06] treasure that
[1:37:09] how valuable is that
[1:37:14] i've collected a few coins and i i love
[1:37:18] to get little coins i like silver
[1:37:20] dollars and i can i as time ago i'd
[1:37:23] collect a few dollars in the dates and
[1:37:26] everything from when that they started
[1:37:28] and and and uh and i finally got a
[1:37:32] collection put together and there's one
[1:37:34] coin that i don't have
[1:37:37] and i looked and i searched for it and
[1:37:39] then i finally found one that was very
[1:37:42] leg very it wasn't very legible at all
[1:37:45] you couldn't see the dates on it at all
[1:37:47] but it was a coin
[1:37:49] and everything and i thought well i
[1:37:51] finally found this silver dollar and i
[1:37:53] inquired how much it was and they wanted
[1:37:56] 45 000
[1:37:57] for it
[1:38:01] well i figured if i can't complete it i
[1:38:03] might as well sell it
[1:38:05] it's like having a puzzle
[1:38:08] without a piece
[1:38:10] but do you see how valuable
[1:38:13] that coin was
[1:38:16] to finish the collection
[1:38:20] so how valuable are the revelations
[1:38:24] that were hid from the foundation of the
[1:38:26] world to make you complete
[1:38:30] you understand it's not about completing
[1:38:33] the gospel it's about completing you
[1:38:36] it's about making you whole it's about
[1:38:39] opening your understanding and therefore
[1:38:42] it says it's for you
[1:38:47] it's not a study
[1:38:51] it was something that that you need
[1:38:56] so let's watch his key unfold just this
[1:38:59] one paragraph here
[1:39:01] he says
[1:39:02] that's been hidden from
[1:39:04] will be revealed
[1:39:08] and we yet a humble little group
[1:39:11] compared to all the world
[1:39:14] we've enjoyed these blessings
[1:39:17] of hearing those mysteries
[1:39:20] now
[1:39:21] we have been
[1:39:23] but
[1:39:24] look at these next few statements
[1:39:27] and
[1:39:28] as
[1:39:29] we are
[1:39:32] going to sort of review
[1:39:34] some of the things that were
[1:39:36] opened up to us
[1:39:38] and he puts them in three categories
[1:39:42] he says
[1:39:44] he says
[1:39:45] he says this little humble group
[1:39:48] hearing the mysteries marriage and
[1:39:49] divorce serpent seed and all these
[1:39:51] different
[1:39:52] questions have been completely revealed
[1:39:56] to us
[1:39:58] not by man but by god himself
[1:40:01] at the
[1:40:02] opened
[1:40:04] that's opened them seven
[1:40:06] mysteries of what the church was
[1:40:13] what the church was no not history
[1:40:17] not what the church was you know it was
[1:40:19] back in the early days in it it was
[1:40:22] persecuted
[1:40:23] like like a history no he's saying this
[1:40:27] revealed to by god to us
[1:40:30] what the church was
[1:40:32] to him
[1:40:36] what was it to him what was it
[1:40:39] what was it that he was doing
[1:40:41] what was it not not historically what it
[1:40:44] was but what it meant
[1:40:50] why
[1:40:51] why was this done
[1:40:53] and and we know this we could go to many
[1:40:55] other sermons and other messages and
[1:40:58] pull out many many quotes uh to
[1:41:01] emphasize on this but you know our
[1:41:03] messenger showed us he said what the
[1:41:05] church was it was the expression of god
[1:41:09] himself
[1:41:13] because
[1:41:15] he wanted
[1:41:16] he wanted someone he could have
[1:41:18] fellowship with
[1:41:21] he wanted someone that could express his
[1:41:24] attributes
[1:41:26] that he could have preeminence
[1:41:29] and receive worship
[1:41:32] so this is what this church was to him
[1:41:36] it was the expression of his attributes
[1:41:39] we that's been revealed to us since
[1:41:42] those seals have been opened in many
[1:41:44] different sermons
[1:41:50] what what what
[1:41:51] what it was
[1:41:54] when god
[1:41:55] did it
[1:41:57] when he decided to create man
[1:42:00] when he decided to create the earth
[1:42:03] we know that that
[1:42:05] there were those three great things that
[1:42:07] he wanted he wanted to reveal himself
[1:42:10] right
[1:42:12] he wanted to have preeminence
[1:42:16] fellowship
[1:42:18] right preeminence he wanted to
[1:42:20] be be the uh
[1:42:23] reveal and and have the preeminence in
[1:42:25] other words to be worshipped as god
[1:42:29] another he's first
[1:42:32] and so
[1:42:33] we could go to many places that these
[1:42:36] things have been
[1:42:38] been shown to us
[1:42:40] of what that god had in mind
[1:42:44] well nobody knew what god had in mind
[1:42:49] everybody just said well i was a sinner
[1:42:51] to begin with and one day i got saved
[1:42:53] and
[1:42:54] one day i'll get rewarded
[1:42:58] but
[1:42:59] the
[1:43:00] what was revealed to us
[1:43:03] was hid from the foundation of the world
[1:43:06] that's why nobody else could preach
[1:43:08] these things
[1:43:11] nobody went back to the beginning to
[1:43:13] never preach what was in god's mind
[1:43:16] well how could they know what was in
[1:43:18] god's mind you know how our messenger
[1:43:20] knew what god was in god's mind because
[1:43:22] god told them
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:27] he told him what was in mind he told
[1:43:29] what he had in mind he revealed to him
[1:43:32] and showed him these things look let's
[1:43:34] look at number two there so first of all
[1:43:37] we understand
[1:43:38] now why that god created us in the first
[1:43:41] place
[1:43:43] oh let me tell you something if you know
[1:43:45] why he created you
[1:43:48] and then you know that god can do
[1:43:50] anything but lie
[1:43:55] he can't lie
[1:43:57] and he can't fail
[1:44:01] so if he had a reason for creating you
[1:44:04] that reason can never fail
[1:44:10] now he might have to do some skinning
[1:44:12] away and he might have to do some
[1:44:14] carving them like he told paul paul it's
[1:44:17] hard to kick against the prick you know
[1:44:19] i'm going to show you what you're going
[1:44:20] to suffer for me i had you called i had
[1:44:23] you wrote down in in the book of
[1:44:25] revelations in my mind that you were
[1:44:28] going to be that angel messenger to the
[1:44:32] gentiles now that's a revelation
[1:44:36] paul got a real good revelation of why
[1:44:38] he was
[1:44:43] wouldn't you like to know
[1:44:44] why you
[1:44:46] are that lies in the great
[1:44:50] message
[1:44:51] of the hour
[1:44:53] then he goes on he says
[1:44:56] in the second
[1:44:57] one is
[1:44:58] how
[1:45:03] because
[1:45:05] of what the church was
[1:45:08] and how it was in christ
[1:45:11] at the beginning
[1:45:13] how it was in christ
[1:45:17] at the beginning
[1:45:21] well
[1:45:21] how was he
[1:45:24] in her
[1:45:26] in the beginning
[1:45:28] that was a question we know that answer
[1:45:33] because when he opened those things he
[1:45:36] revealed you think the thing about it is
[1:45:38] are we taking these things
[1:45:41] because i believe the prophet of god is
[1:45:42] laying these things out there because
[1:45:45] these things are going to become part of
[1:45:47] our quickening
[1:45:51] they're going to be these understandings
[1:45:53] are going to be part of the things that
[1:45:55] allows us to change and overcome this
[1:46:00] flesh
[1:46:02] because the flesh is warring against the
[1:46:04] spirit if you don't know where you come
[1:46:06] from you don't know why you're here
[1:46:09] you don't think you have any reason in
[1:46:11] your life that's why people despair
[1:46:15] that's why people come to the place that
[1:46:17] they get in such a condition that they
[1:46:20] take their life because they don't have
[1:46:22] any idea what they're living for or why
[1:46:25] they should live but i'll tell you
[1:46:27] something if you know he created a place
[1:46:30] for you to be in glory it don't matter
[1:46:32] what you come against
[1:46:37] you you're the victorious
[1:46:43] i mean i can understand people looking
[1:46:46] at this world and say well i put all my
[1:46:48] money into a certain thing and the stock
[1:46:50] market crashes and
[1:46:53] i forget how many people took their
[1:46:55] lives
[1:46:56] in the black friday
[1:47:01] you can't
[1:47:02] lose something that's eternal
[1:47:10] and and so
[1:47:12] he he wanted to know uh
[1:47:15] how it was in christ in the beginning we
[1:47:19] know we are in christ in the beginning
[1:47:21] because we know we are a part of his
[1:47:23] thinking
[1:47:25] we are in his thoughts
[1:47:28] we know how we were in him in the
[1:47:30] beginning we were in him by the lamb's
[1:47:33] book of life
[1:47:36] just think of the understandings that
[1:47:38] have been
[1:47:39] been revealed to you and that week that
[1:47:42] he's saying it's for you in other words
[1:47:44] these things were opened up for you so
[1:47:47] you could know your names on the lamb's
[1:47:50] book of life could you know that you
[1:47:52] were in his thinking
[1:47:56] before the foundation
[1:47:58] of the world
[1:48:02] how many i love this quote i i know i'm
[1:48:04] going to paraphrase it
[1:48:06] but
[1:48:07] just to think how were we in him in the
[1:48:10] beginning the prophet of god said the
[1:48:12] color of your hair the color of your
[1:48:15] eyes the statue that you're in though it
[1:48:18] was a million
[1:48:20] many years and years and years ago yet
[1:48:23] he knew you
[1:48:25] then
[1:48:29] how you were in him by foreign knowledge
[1:48:32] how that he took the wedding band a
[1:48:35] predestination
[1:48:36] after put it on your finger and married
[1:48:39] you then he engaged you
[1:48:43] if i could say this in his thinking
[1:48:49] you say why would he pick a sinner like
[1:48:51] me because he had the power to change
[1:49:02] he didn't look at what you
[1:49:05] were
[1:49:07] by your first husband
[1:49:11] the mystery of marriage and divorce he
[1:49:14] knew what was going to happen when that
[1:49:16] husband died
[1:49:18] and he enspoused you
[1:49:23] and then so
[1:49:25] i just thought of these things how we
[1:49:27] could preach on how we are him in the
[1:49:29] beginning how we're
[1:49:31] in his thinking how we're in his
[1:49:32] thoughts how where our name was put on
[1:49:34] the lamb's book of life don't you love
[1:49:36] this great statement he says god put
[1:49:38] your name on the lamb's book of life and
[1:49:41] nothing can put it on and nothing can
[1:49:43] take it off
[1:49:48] so many people think oh i've done
[1:49:49] something to take me out of the mind of
[1:49:52] god no well you were yet sinners he died
[1:49:55] for you
[1:49:56] that's why he came for you
[1:49:59] because he knew he was going to come to
[1:50:01] you
[1:50:02] in the condition that the world and the
[1:50:06] flesh put you into he understood that's
[1:50:09] where you would be
[1:50:12] but oh what a price
[1:50:16] amen isn't that wonderful
[1:50:18] doesn't that just bless your heart to
[1:50:20] sit there and be able to know and even
[1:50:24] the disciples spoke to it and it laid
[1:50:26] right in the scriptures we were in him
[1:50:28] in the beginning foreordained unto good
[1:50:30] works that we should walk in him
[1:50:33] we're his workmanship in christ jesus
[1:50:38] and so we have a message that comes and
[1:50:41] just doesn't take it back
[1:50:43] to the gospel being preached
[1:50:46] he took it back
[1:50:48] all the way back
[1:50:50] to the beginning
[1:50:53] way back
[1:50:55] before
[1:50:56] this world ever came
[1:50:59] so we could totally understand that this
[1:51:01] world couldn't ruin it
[1:51:04] amen because it was already established
[1:51:08] in him
[1:51:09] in the beginning
[1:51:12] oh that opens a door to us
[1:51:15] it opens the door for us to look at the
[1:51:17] our pathetic state
[1:51:21] and know that that
[1:51:23] somebody else had something in mind for
[1:51:25] us
[1:51:26] and that we could turn to him and seek
[1:51:29] it
[1:51:29] and look for it
[1:51:32] and ask for great things to transpire
[1:51:37] in our lives on our behalf
[1:51:39] because of his will
[1:51:41] and that this last
[1:51:43] part he says and how it was in christ at
[1:51:48] the beginning
[1:51:51] how it was in christ at the beginning in
[1:51:53] his mind
[1:51:55] and then he says
[1:51:56] and how it would be revealed
[1:52:00] in the last day
[1:52:05] now
[1:52:07] he's talking about the church
[1:52:11] he's talking about the word bright how
[1:52:14] will the word bride be revealed
[1:52:18] in this last day
[1:52:20] how will it be made manifest
[1:52:22] how will it be revealed how will it come
[1:52:26] to the knowledge
[1:52:29] of itself
[1:52:34] so there's got to be a way that god has
[1:52:37] chosen
[1:52:39] to reveal to you
[1:52:43] who you are where you come from what
[1:52:46] your purpose was
[1:52:49] and so we he said how how is how is it
[1:52:53] how is the the bride church how is it
[1:52:56] going to be revealed
[1:52:59] in the last days
[1:53:03] well revelation
[1:53:04] is another word for
[1:53:07] faith
[1:53:10] how could this faith
[1:53:12] going to be revealed
[1:53:15] to
[1:53:16] the church in the last day how is this
[1:53:19] revelation
[1:53:21] of
[1:53:22] where she was in the beginning
[1:53:26] what she was
[1:53:28] and how she was going to be in christ in
[1:53:31] the beginning how was this going to be
[1:53:35] revealed
[1:53:36] to
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:38] the bride church in the last days how is
[1:53:42] it going to happen
[1:53:45] and i know
[1:53:47] our first mind
[1:53:48] thought of our mind goes to
[1:53:53] malachi 4 5.
[1:53:55] but malachi 4 5 was just the vessel
[1:54:00] the prophetic vessel
[1:54:02] but who revealed
[1:54:04] where we were in him
[1:54:06] who revealed what we were that was done
[1:54:09] by the son of man
[1:54:16] when he shall come
[1:54:21] in the last days
[1:54:23] how did we know the last days by the
[1:54:25] sodom condition
[1:54:27] as it was in the days of noah as it was
[1:54:30] in the days of sodom we understand that
[1:54:33] there was a way that he was going to
[1:54:36] come
[1:54:37] and reveal
[1:54:39] where you were who you were what you're
[1:54:41] in the beginning what you were he how
[1:54:43] was that going to be revealed and now he
[1:54:46] showed us how it was going to be
[1:54:48] revealed it was going to be revealed to
[1:54:50] us by luke 17 30.
[1:54:56] a prophet
[1:54:59] whom
[1:55:01] the lord could come
[1:55:05] and dwell
[1:55:08] in a vessel
[1:55:13] and speak
[1:55:15] to the thoughts and intents of your
[1:55:18] heart
[1:55:21] you didn't have to be discerned
[1:55:23] because it's the word that's sharper and
[1:55:26] more powerful than the two-edged sword
[1:55:30] it wasn't just a man that was preaching
[1:55:34] it was elohim
[1:55:36] god veiled in flesh in our day was going
[1:55:40] to be how that he was going to show us
[1:55:43] how it was going to be revealed to her
[1:55:46] in the last days
[1:55:50] it's not just
[1:55:52] some
[1:55:53] good bible student came along
[1:55:57] that was more than a man
[1:56:03] it was him
[1:56:06] whatever he said
[1:56:13] how many times did he say i
[1:56:15] i don't know you you don't know me but
[1:56:18] he knows you
[1:56:21] do you believe that he can use me or he
[1:56:23] through me can reveal to you
[1:56:27] the things that anybody else does he was
[1:56:30] showing us
[1:56:32] how he was going to do it in the last
[1:56:35] days
[1:56:37] can you imagine
[1:56:40] men who spent years and have phd and lld
[1:56:44] and and all these letters and all these
[1:56:47] initials and all these great trying to
[1:56:49] piece this bible together and yet god
[1:56:52] chose you
[1:56:55] and open your eyes to see him
[1:56:59] come back in this gentile church age and
[1:57:03] show you where you were with him in the
[1:57:05] beginning and who that you really are
[1:57:10] oh praise god
[1:57:13] hallelujah
[1:57:15] how do we value that
[1:57:19] is it a pearl of great price to you this
[1:57:22] is a treasure hid in the field
[1:57:25] do we see what it is how great it is
[1:57:30] and what a magnificent
[1:57:32] uh
[1:57:33] wonderful
[1:57:35] uh thing that he's done for us to
[1:57:38] to
[1:57:40] make known to us these great things
[1:57:44] all that was in that two paragraphs
[1:57:50] i think sometimes we
[1:57:53] we skim
[1:57:59] instead of study
[1:58:03] and god has many ways to speak to us
[1:58:06] through song through the ministry
[1:58:09] through fellowship through edification
[1:58:12] but these things i think are necessary
[1:58:15] that we
[1:58:18] set
[1:58:19] them in our hearts
[1:58:22] and if i could use the terminology maybe
[1:58:24] it's not a good terminology but when you
[1:58:26] can look at the message the overview
[1:58:30] of what it is
[1:58:32] you can understand why it doesn't fit in
[1:58:35] a denominational system
[1:58:41] why it has to be something above a
[1:58:44] man-made system
[1:58:45] how it's got to be something personal
[1:58:48] how it's got to be something that it is
[1:58:51] uh
[1:58:52] uh anointed to you and revealed to you
[1:58:56] and and shown to you
[1:58:58] how it would be revealed in this last
[1:59:02] days it wasn't going to be revealed
[1:59:04] through a system it wasn't going to be
[1:59:06] revealed to an organization
[1:59:13] and if it's not revealed that way then
[1:59:16] it can't become one
[1:59:21] the only thing man can organize
[1:59:24] is their own thinking
[1:59:27] and many of us have a hard time
[1:59:29] organizing our own thinking
[1:59:33] but aren't you glad
[1:59:34] that he chose flesh and blood have not
[1:59:37] revealed this to you
[1:59:40] but my father which in heaven has
[1:59:42] revealed this to you so he laid to us
[1:59:45] right then the understanding that this
[1:59:48] church was not going to be revealed by
[1:59:51] any other thing than divine revelation
[1:59:59] pray for revelation
[2:00:02] more than ever more than anything else
[2:00:04] pray for revelation
[2:00:07] how beautiful it's laid there
[2:00:10] and this we have a lot of pages to go
[2:00:13] through in the next few services but
[2:00:15] i like this statement that he made in
[2:00:17] the 16th
[2:00:18] uh
[2:00:20] paragraph
[2:00:21] at the end of the paragraph he said
[2:00:25] he said
[2:00:27] from him cometh
[2:00:29] this light shining
[2:00:31] on the right hand side
[2:00:34] to which
[2:00:36] he's looking to
[2:00:38] and on the cross that's where he looked
[2:00:42] to the right
[2:00:44] and he pardoned
[2:00:45] the sinner
[2:00:47] in the light
[2:00:48] of the resurrection
[2:00:50] we still go forth
[2:00:52] in his name
[2:00:55] another when you say in how many in our
[2:00:58] language we say in the light of
[2:01:01] in other words with the understanding of
[2:01:05] or with the knowledge of
[2:01:07] or in the light of these facts
[2:01:11] or in the light of the new evidence or
[2:01:14] in the light of what's been shown
[2:01:17] another the light is the understanding
[2:01:24] in in the light what does a light do a
[2:01:27] light
[2:01:28] shows the hidden things of that of
[2:01:31] darkness another the light shines into
[2:01:34] the dark places
[2:01:36] of our understanding
[2:01:41] the questions you might have
[2:01:43] the answers that you might have
[2:01:46] the wonderment you might have about why
[2:01:49] your life came the way it is why did you
[2:01:52] do the things you do
[2:01:54] all the different
[2:01:56] failures
[2:01:57] that we have
[2:01:59] about our lives
[2:02:02] but when the light is shined on them
[2:02:07] then in the light
[2:02:09] of the resurrection
[2:02:11] we go forward
[2:02:13] knowing that he is not dead
[2:02:16] but he is alive and he lives forever
[2:02:19] more and because he's risen that makes
[2:02:23] him present to be able to perform and
[2:02:26] carry out every promise
[2:02:30] that's how we go forward
[2:02:32] in the light
[2:02:34] and the understanding
[2:02:37] that he's alive
[2:02:40] how real is that to us
[2:02:45] that it's it's beyond the story
[2:02:50] that he is
[2:02:52] he wasn't the i was or the will be
[2:02:56] he says i'm the i
[2:02:58] am i am the truth and the life
[2:03:04] no man cometh unto the father
[2:03:06] but by me
[2:03:10] in the light of the fact
[2:03:14] that he rose from the dead
[2:03:17] all things are possible
[2:03:21] in the light
[2:03:22] that he overcame
[2:03:29] death hell in the grave
[2:03:32] in the light
[2:03:34] of the
[2:03:36] revelation
[2:03:38] and understanding
[2:03:39] of his
[2:03:41] resurrection we go forward
[2:03:44] why can we face the challenge
[2:03:47] because he's risen
[2:03:49] how come we don't fear death
[2:03:52] because he's risen
[2:03:55] how come we know won't be overcome by
[2:03:57] the enemy because he's risen amen
[2:04:02] what what what what was
[2:04:05] his resurrection
[2:04:07] it was the
[2:04:08] revelation that there was life after
[2:04:11] death
[2:04:14] think of what he revealed
[2:04:16] think of what it means to us this is not
[2:04:19] the end of us this is just the beginning
[2:04:24] that we're not stuck with these bodies
[2:04:27] that we will receive a body likened unto
[2:04:30] his praise god
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:34] think of what what it was that's what we
[2:04:36] go forward with
[2:04:39] oh satan you made me sick i got another
[2:04:41] one
[2:04:43] hallelujah
[2:04:47] i love that quote i hold it in my heart
[2:04:50] again i may just paraphrase it but he
[2:04:53] said if god wants you to
[2:04:57] go
[2:05:00] he says there's not enough doctors in
[2:05:02] medicine to keep you here
[2:05:05] but if god wants you to remain there's
[2:05:08] not enough sickness or devils to take
[2:05:10] you
[2:05:15] how can we go forward with that
[2:05:18] because we have the light
[2:05:22] and the revelation of the resurrection
[2:05:25] which is we know there's life after
[2:05:27] death if we if it's not made right here
[2:05:30] it'll be made right there
[2:05:35] oh
[2:05:37] you talked about
[2:05:41] wonderful
[2:05:44] i mean everything that satan had he
[2:05:46] threw at him and he overcome
[2:05:51] and we can be overcomers as he overcame
[2:05:54] so can we overcame by the word of our
[2:05:57] testimony
[2:06:00] what a wonderful thing that we go
[2:06:02] forward
[2:06:04] in the light
[2:06:05] of the resurrection we go forward with
[2:06:07] the understanding of the life after
[2:06:10] death
[2:06:11] it's why we live
[2:06:13] that's why we make our choices
[2:06:16] that's why we're willing to sacrifice
[2:06:19] and give up of this world
[2:06:22] because we know
[2:06:24] there's a resurrection
[2:06:27] we know if he rose from the dead he
[2:06:29] promised us that we will
[2:06:31] also rise i am the resurrection
[2:06:37] and then i like this little statement he
[2:06:39] made at the bottom of that paragraph
[2:06:41] he says we're at the end time
[2:06:44] we see it the
[2:06:46] last sentence in paragraph 17.
[2:06:49] we're at the end time
[2:06:51] we see it
[2:06:54] we
[2:06:55] wonder sometimes
[2:06:57] why it hasn't spread over the earth
[2:07:00] maybe some time
[2:07:02] we'll have a chance to explain that
[2:07:05] if god willing
[2:07:07] you know how he explained to us it was
[2:07:10] nothing but jealousy
[2:07:14] you know what i mean
[2:07:16] that
[2:07:17] everybody would become equal
[2:07:20] there'd be no big eyes or little use
[2:07:24] we'd all had one absolute
[2:07:26] we would all had one voice we would all
[2:07:29] had
[2:07:30] one interpretation
[2:07:33] wouldn't that be wonderful
[2:07:35] all of us in one mind
[2:07:37] and one accord
[2:07:40] united around one thing
[2:07:43] everybody recognizing that the lord had
[2:07:46] come back
[2:07:47] in our generation
[2:07:49] and answered the questions
[2:07:51] revealed where we come from what we were
[2:07:54] what we was what it was
[2:07:58] where it was at in the beginning
[2:08:00] and we all saw how god was revealing it
[2:08:04] but it's funny isn't it
[2:08:07] jealousy
[2:08:09] that's what he said it's just pure
[2:08:11] jealousy
[2:08:13] that's what cain
[2:08:15] was
[2:08:16] he was jealous
[2:08:18] because god accepted his sacrifice
[2:08:21] they're jealous
[2:08:23] because god chose a little man
[2:08:26] without a great college education
[2:08:28] that wasn't a part of their system
[2:08:31] to have the world's greatest revival
[2:08:34] since the time of the lord
[2:08:39] pure jealousy
[2:08:41] because they couldn't see what it was
[2:08:45] they couldn't see the cloud
[2:08:46] they couldn't see the pillar of fire
[2:08:49] they couldn't hear the gospel
[2:08:52] they were jealous
[2:08:54] and then he goes on later in one of the
[2:08:56] messages he says they had nothing in
[2:09:00] them to
[2:09:01] believe with
[2:09:04] how come it didn't sweep across the
[2:09:06] world
[2:09:07] because they had nothing in them to
[2:09:11] believe with how many i
[2:09:14] saints i've met people that are better
[2:09:17] christians than i am
[2:09:19] they got such a sweet spirit and such a
[2:09:22] meek spirit and nothing rattles them and
[2:09:25] they just flow through life you know and
[2:09:28] okay and you think well life's easy
[2:09:31] you know
[2:09:32] well
[2:09:34] you know get under some of that pressure
[2:09:40] you don't think that pressure will drive
[2:09:41] you place the prophet of god said i
[2:09:43] didn't care if every single one of them
[2:09:44] went over a cliff
[2:09:49] you know it's pretty hard to walk a mile
[2:09:52] but when you get in somebody else's
[2:09:53] moccasins right
[2:09:55] you know what that is don't you that's
[2:09:57] brotherly kindness
[2:09:59] that's understanding what's going
[2:10:00] through what kind of pressure's been
[2:10:03] put on
[2:10:05] you know i don't have a great pressure
[2:10:07] maybe at 300 350 people or so
[2:10:10] in our congregation
[2:10:13] just think of that that that
[2:10:14] responsibility that i have that i'm
[2:10:16] going to be judged for every word that i
[2:10:20] say
[2:10:21] for every insinuation i make whether i
[2:10:24] tell the truth or don't tell the truth
[2:10:26] how would you like to carry the whole
[2:10:28] church age
[2:10:32] the seals
[2:10:35] the mysteries that were hid from the
[2:10:37] foundation of the world how would you
[2:10:40] like to carry that pressure on you
[2:10:46] people say they want to be a prophet
[2:10:47] they can have it
[2:10:54] how'd you like to sit up here and know
[2:10:56] every secret that's every one of your
[2:10:58] hearts
[2:11:02] i don't want my secrets known so i
[2:11:04] certainly don't want to know your
[2:11:06] secrets i don't want no tit for tat
[2:11:11] you know just let the blood
[2:11:13] cover us from all unrighteousness do you
[2:11:16] know what i mean
[2:11:17] but but you you think why didn't it
[2:11:20] spread well he didn't have anything in
[2:11:22] him and to believe with how much more
[2:11:24] pressure to you then is the revelation
[2:11:27] that god gave you especially you people
[2:11:29] in school you young men young women that
[2:11:31] are just starting your lives and
[2:11:33] starting to come into places where
[2:11:35] you'll you'll have peers and you'll have
[2:11:38] business associates okay and you're
[2:11:40] moving out from school into life
[2:11:44] how much greater is it to bear the
[2:11:46] reproach
[2:11:50] of this message
[2:11:52] because you know it's been given to you
[2:11:56] to believe
[2:12:01] would you sell that
[2:12:04] elvis presley had it
[2:12:09] can you believe it
[2:12:14] but he sold it
[2:12:17] for a fleet of
[2:12:19] to be a movie star
[2:12:21] to be called the
[2:12:23] king
[2:12:29] how what kind of torment do you think
[2:12:30] he's going through now
[2:12:33] i don't know whether it was true but
[2:12:35] i've been told that wherever he's buried
[2:12:37] there over at graceland that they pump
[2:12:41] his music
[2:12:42] in around his
[2:12:44] tomb
[2:12:47] his own voice
[2:12:49] his own choices
[2:12:51] and everything
[2:12:52] coming right back at him to torment him
[2:12:57] why would we sell
[2:12:59] what we've got
[2:13:01] for a few
[2:13:03] praises
[2:13:04] of the world
[2:13:10] you know i know what it's like to be
[2:13:12] resisted
[2:13:14] and i know believe me i have enough
[2:13:16] discernment
[2:13:18] to understand
[2:13:20] where it comes from
[2:13:22] but you know what
[2:13:24] we go with the resurrection
[2:13:27] stand all you want goliath
[2:13:31] it's thus saith the lord
[2:13:34] you're a part of that
[2:13:38] may i just jump ahead he's going to talk
[2:13:40] about
[2:13:41] the power
[2:13:43] the quickening power
[2:13:45] that can come into you so you have
[2:13:48] victory over all things
[2:13:50] we're just going to close up here we
[2:13:51] just got a few more statements i thought
[2:13:53] paragraph 32 was good for those that
[2:13:56] battle with vaccination
[2:14:05] i don't know if he put it up there or
[2:14:07] not but
[2:14:08] but
[2:14:10] i'm not going to preach at on
[2:14:13] vaccination
[2:14:15] i told you i got vaccinated because i
[2:14:17] wanted to go into canada
[2:14:19] so i have a perfect quote
[2:14:21] because hook is whatever choice you make
[2:14:24] just make it along with the word
[2:14:27] don't let anybody force you either way
[2:14:29] you have backbone in your conviction
[2:14:32] if you're convicted not to take it then
[2:14:34] don't take it
[2:14:37] you know but
[2:14:38] if if you're in a situation and they're
[2:14:41] bringing that question to you
[2:14:43] this might help you
[2:14:46] is that fair enough
[2:14:50] so
[2:14:51] what did he say here he said that
[2:14:55] he said now if it's
[2:14:58] and if he began to preach and so we go
[2:15:00] to paragraph
[2:15:02] if i could say
[2:15:04] paragraph
[2:15:05] 30
[2:15:06] 1.
[2:15:08] he said therefore if god raised up jesus
[2:15:11] from the dead
[2:15:13] did he raise him up for a memorial
[2:15:19] now we have a memorial to george
[2:15:21] washington i always wanted to see it one
[2:15:23] time we went to washington to see and i
[2:15:26] i looked at this great big piece of rock
[2:15:28] sticking up in the air and believe me it
[2:15:30] didn't let me know george washington any
[2:15:32] more than i knew him
[2:15:37] i went to lincoln memorial and i saw a
[2:15:39] great big statue of abraham lincoln and
[2:15:41] i thought man he must have come from the
[2:15:44] land of nod
[2:15:45] he must be a
[2:15:46] great you know a straight uh descendant
[2:15:50] of goliath
[2:15:51] i didn't know abraham lincoln
[2:15:55] any more
[2:15:56] than i ever know
[2:16:00] i couldn't tell you one thing about
[2:16:02] abraham lincoln
[2:16:04] i can't tell you if he liked barbecue
[2:16:09] or tortillas
[2:16:12] i don't know he might have liked fufu
[2:16:14] and salsa i don't know
[2:16:16] i don't know nothing about abraham
[2:16:18] lincoln
[2:16:23] i don't know nothing about george
[2:16:25] washington except for that he never
[2:16:28] told a lie and the bible said that's a
[2:16:30] lie
[2:16:33] so that whole memorial
[2:16:35] is a lie
[2:16:40] that he chopped down a cherry tree
[2:16:47] think of it
[2:16:49] memorials
[2:16:51] memorial you know sunday morning is not
[2:16:54] supposed to be a memorial
[2:17:00] to the resurrection
[2:17:03] we're just gleaning this morning you
[2:17:05] understand we're just going back over
[2:17:06] the statements brother random made so we
[2:17:09] can talk about this morning i know i'm
[2:17:12] doing the talking but you're amenning
[2:17:13] and you're in the spirit of it so that
[2:17:15] we can talk about the things that he's
[2:17:18] telling us
[2:17:20] the idea when you start a message is not
[2:17:23] to get to the end of it
[2:17:27] the idea is to see jesus christ in every
[2:17:31] word
[2:17:32] and he said if you don't go back and
[2:17:35] read it again
[2:17:40] these things this
[2:17:41] word that was put in the storehouse and
[2:17:44] you know and thank the lord for brother
[2:17:46] roy borders and brother doug mccues
[2:17:49] those guys that started spoken word and
[2:17:51] started printing these things in a
[2:17:53] garage
[2:17:56] in
[2:17:58] tucson
[2:18:01] to get them out to us
[2:18:04] that we can go back
[2:18:05] and have something that we can hear
[2:18:10] read
[2:18:12] and pray
[2:18:16] the three ways which people learn
[2:18:21] in sales
[2:18:23] we had a
[2:18:25] method
[2:18:26] and it was
[2:18:28] you tell them
[2:18:31] tell them what you told them
[2:18:36] that's what you do
[2:18:39] you tell them
[2:18:40] then you tell them what you told them
[2:18:46] hardly anybody ever learns on the first
[2:18:49] go around
[2:18:51] people who learn everything the first
[2:18:53] time around you can't imagine how much
[2:18:55] of themselves
[2:18:57] they have in it
[2:18:59] the word has two parts to it
[2:19:02] first the killing
[2:19:04] and then the resurrection
[2:19:06] first the sacrifice
[2:19:08] then the life
[2:19:12] first of all you've got to give up your
[2:19:14] own thinking in order to receive his
[2:19:16] thinking
[2:19:19] so he says here in this paragraph he
[2:19:21] said
[2:19:23] he says satan don't care how religious
[2:19:25] you are
[2:19:27] or how right you are in your doctrine
[2:19:30] if you miss that life
[2:19:33] you won't
[2:19:34] come up anyhow
[2:19:38] the whole catholic church is based on
[2:19:41] the fact i i've watched them i grew up
[2:19:43] with them
[2:19:44] the mass time comes everybody gets real
[2:19:47] pious they start doing their rosary they
[2:19:50] start going through it and it's really
[2:19:52] something
[2:19:53] and then when it's over they all get up
[2:19:54] they're done and they're out of that
[2:19:56] spirit
[2:19:58] they go in and confess their sins oh i'm
[2:20:00] so sorry they go do their penance like
[2:20:02] their candles they're gone
[2:20:05] he don't care
[2:20:06] how religious you are in closing here
[2:20:10] it's the life
[2:20:12] you won't come up anyhow
[2:20:14] no matter how religious
[2:20:16] how good how many churches you belong to
[2:20:20] or will belong to it doesn't matter one
[2:20:23] thing unless you
[2:20:25] been born again that was paragraph 30
[2:20:28] and 31 he says therefore
[2:20:31] if god raised up jesus from the dead
[2:20:35] did he raise him up
[2:20:38] for a memorial
[2:20:41] something to look at it's not a memorial
[2:20:45] he raised him up so you could know him
[2:20:51] that you didn't have to deal with
[2:20:56] history that he he's here
[2:21:00] so he can introduce himself to you
[2:21:03] you can meet him
[2:21:05] he can make his presence known
[2:21:10] you might say well i didn't see him in
[2:21:11] the flesh but i'll tell you i felt them
[2:21:15] i don't go on feelings but i'll tell you
[2:21:17] what also i've seen i've seen that
[2:21:19] everything that he said
[2:21:21] manifest
[2:21:24] i know he's here because he keeps his
[2:21:27] promises
[2:21:28] and
[2:21:29] so he said did he raise them up for a
[2:21:31] memorial
[2:21:32] no
[2:21:34] and
[2:21:35] and is the resurrection morning only a
[2:21:37] one day a year or a certain day that we
[2:21:40] celebrate
[2:21:42] or
[2:21:43] are we benefactors
[2:21:46] of his resurrection
[2:21:48] so what did he do
[2:21:50] he put in you the same spirit his spirit
[2:21:55] that he had
[2:21:57] that's why he rose up
[2:22:00] go wait there until you're a dude with
[2:22:03] power from high i won't leave you
[2:22:05] comfortless i will come again i'll be in
[2:22:07] you he raised up
[2:22:10] so he could come back
[2:22:13] and put the same spirit that was him in
[2:22:16] you if the same spirit that was in
[2:22:18] christ jesus dwell in you
[2:22:21] it will also quicken your mortal body
[2:22:25] what do we hear the gospel for
[2:22:28] not for a memorial
[2:22:30] not for a study on what's right and
[2:22:31] wrong
[2:22:34] but that same spirit
[2:22:36] that was in him
[2:22:39] i'm going to close with a little thought
[2:22:40] but i'm going to read this right here
[2:22:43] it said
[2:22:45] he put in you the same spirit his spirit
[2:22:47] that he had
[2:22:48] and used to raise himself from the dead
[2:22:57] do you know that quick he said
[2:23:01] he used that spirit to raise himself
[2:23:05] from the dead you could go to saint john
[2:23:08] the gospel of john
[2:23:14] the 10th chapter
[2:23:17] remember communion tonight's just going
[2:23:19] to be straight communion
[2:23:21] service
[2:23:26] do i have that right here
[2:23:29] john 10 and 18.
[2:23:34] he says
[2:23:35] therefore doth my father love me
[2:23:39] because i
[2:23:41] lay down
[2:23:42] my life
[2:23:44] that i might take it
[2:23:47] again
[2:23:50] no man taketh it from me
[2:23:53] but i lay it down of my soul
[2:23:57] i have power to lay it down and i have
[2:24:01] power to take it again
[2:24:04] this commandment have i received of my
[2:24:07] father
[2:24:10] he gave
[2:24:11] he gave that commandment to us
[2:24:14] he says i'm going to give to you
[2:24:17] the power
[2:24:19] the quickening power
[2:24:22] the same spirit
[2:24:25] that i had i'm going to put it in you
[2:24:30] that you can lay down your life
[2:24:34] and take it up again
[2:24:36] we can read
[2:24:38] john 11 25
[2:24:41] it says and jesus said unto her
[2:24:44] i am the resurrection
[2:24:47] and the life
[2:24:48] he that believeth in me
[2:24:51] though he were dead
[2:24:53] yet shall he live
[2:24:55] and whoever believeth
[2:24:57] and believeth in me shall never die
[2:25:00] believeth doubt this
[2:25:04] john
[2:25:06] 14
[2:25:08] and six another great
[2:25:12] scripture
[2:25:13] jesus said unto him
[2:25:15] i am the way
[2:25:17] the truth
[2:25:18] and the life
[2:25:20] no man cometh in the father
[2:25:22] but by me
[2:25:24] amen just think of it
[2:25:27] every bit of it
[2:25:29] right there is that it's not a memorial
[2:25:33] it's something he's going to transfer
[2:25:35] and then if we just close up here with
[2:25:38] paragraph
[2:25:40] 30
[2:25:42] 7
[2:25:43] and 38
[2:25:45] he says now the son at the rising of the
[2:25:47] sun
[2:25:49] will there be was a time when the world
[2:25:52] laid in utter darkness
[2:25:55] it was without form and void
[2:25:58] and it was all covered with water
[2:26:00] and was lying there in dark dismal
[2:26:03] gloomy atmosphere
[2:26:05] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[2:26:07] water and said let there be light and
[2:26:10] god had a reason to do that for down
[2:26:14] beneath
[2:26:15] that water
[2:26:16] there was a seed
[2:26:18] that he had planted
[2:26:20] and it had to have the sunlight to make
[2:26:23] it live
[2:26:25] and the first light that ever was given
[2:26:28] in the earth was god's spoken word
[2:26:31] the first light that ever struck the
[2:26:34] earth was god's spoken word
[2:26:37] you know the bride church
[2:26:39] could not come into existence
[2:26:42] until the word was spoken to bring her
[2:26:45] to life
[2:26:49] just think
[2:26:52] not a denominational life
[2:26:54] not a life of psychology or philosophy
[2:26:57] or education in science
[2:26:59] but their true life was hidden in christ
[2:27:03] and the only thing that can bring you to
[2:27:05] life
[2:27:06] is the true
[2:27:08] unadulterated
[2:27:09] spoken word of god
[2:27:12] not the taught word of god
[2:27:14] but the spoken word of god that's why
[2:27:17] this messenger could not be of education
[2:27:20] he couldn't have dogma he couldn't have
[2:27:22] creeds he had to be a vessel that god
[2:27:25] could speak through
[2:27:27] and he would have
[2:27:28] thus
[2:27:29] saith
[2:27:30] the lord
[2:27:32] and then he goes on to talk about the
[2:27:33] sun being brought up and it's gotta made
[2:27:36] an atmosphere and he said what was it to
[2:27:39] do it was to bring joy
[2:27:42] and life two times he talks about it
[2:27:46] joy in life this wasn't meant to be
[2:27:49] gloom
[2:27:52] it wasn't woes me i've got eternal life
[2:27:58] i've passed from death on the life but
[2:28:01] nobody in the world believes it
[2:28:05] so i'm stuck down here with a bunch of
[2:28:07] these nimba cells
[2:28:11] and it's just so bad that i got to go to
[2:28:14] work and i got to deal with this and i
[2:28:16] got to deal with that
[2:28:19] it's not why they came for it
[2:28:22] it came forth that you might have joy
[2:28:25] and life
[2:28:27] that you might know you've got eternal
[2:28:29] life
[2:28:30] nothing's passing you by
[2:28:36] he's with you
[2:28:38] and he'll be with you all the way
[2:28:40] through
[2:28:41] and
[2:28:42] and so he says so he said
[2:28:45] he said
[2:28:47] and i and i wrote this note he said you
[2:28:49] are a direct product
[2:28:51] of what you have heard
[2:28:53] and what was revealed to you
[2:28:57] you are what you are
[2:28:59] because of the word of god
[2:29:02] in the story
[2:29:06] i i imagine all the time
[2:29:09] what i would be
[2:29:10] or where i would be or what would have i
[2:29:13] have done or what could have i have been
[2:29:16] how great would this be or how great
[2:29:18] would that be
[2:29:25] i'm a direct product
[2:29:27] of what i heard
[2:29:30] i heard california was going to sink i
[2:29:32] came out
[2:29:34] i heard there was baptism in the name
[2:29:36] lord jesus christ i got baptized
[2:29:39] i heard there was only one god i don't
[2:29:41] believe in a trinity
[2:29:43] you're a direct product of what you've
[2:29:46] heard
[2:29:47] in other words what's been revealed to
[2:29:49] you
[2:29:50] god
[2:29:51] changes your mind
[2:29:55] he transforms your thinking he
[2:29:57] transforms your look on life he's
[2:29:59] actually taking you where you are going
[2:30:01] on one road and he comes along and he
[2:30:03] puts his word and he speaks to you you
[2:30:06] become a direct effect of that word and
[2:30:08] you transform into what he had in mind
[2:30:12] for you to begin with how does he do
[2:30:14] that he does it by the spoken word
[2:30:20] he changes you
[2:30:22] he's not done
[2:30:25] changing us praise god give me more word
[2:30:28] let me listen to more word
[2:30:31] i want more change change comes by the
[2:30:33] word of god you are a direct if you shut
[2:30:37] that voice off
[2:30:42] that's where you stop
[2:30:46] the minute you think i know all he said
[2:30:48] i understand everything he said there's
[2:30:50] nothing more to be revealed i have it
[2:30:52] all here on tape just as long as i have
[2:30:55] it on tape i'm okay no it's got to speak
[2:30:57] to you
[2:30:58] it's got to transform you
[2:31:02] okay and so we we know that great thing
[2:31:04] that he said that we're a direct product
[2:31:08] he says so the sun has risen to bring
[2:31:10] eternal joy and life
[2:31:13] and resurrect and revelation
[2:31:16] that there's life
[2:31:17] after death
[2:31:19] and i'd like to say this in closing
[2:31:21] why this is all
[2:31:24] so wonderfully important
[2:31:26] that we understand the resurrection
[2:31:30] though
[2:31:32] leslie and sharon with had the
[2:31:35] morning devotion and listening to
[2:31:38] a portion of what the prophet of god
[2:31:41] said and brother graham said there's two
[2:31:43] mountains
[2:31:45] one's mount sinai
[2:31:48] and the other one's
[2:31:50] mount calvary
[2:31:51] he said too many people are living on
[2:31:54] mount sinai
[2:31:58] mount sinai is the history
[2:32:01] of your failure
[2:32:05] mount sinai was thou shalt not steal
[2:32:08] you know why he had to say thou shalt
[2:32:10] not steal because they stole
[2:32:14] every man did what was right in his own
[2:32:17] eyes
[2:32:18] why did he say thou shalt not commit
[2:32:20] adultery because man is an adulteress
[2:32:24] he's an idol worshiper he's a blasphemer
[2:32:27] he's bear's false witness
[2:32:31] and when you come and you live on mount
[2:32:33] calvary then you read the gospel and the
[2:32:37] prophet of god preaches you you
[2:32:38] shouldn't be this way you shouldn't be
[2:32:40] that way you shouldn't be that way you
[2:32:43] can't stay on mount sinai
[2:32:49] this message can condemn you
[2:32:52] to where you don't think you have a
[2:32:54] choice
[2:32:59] you would say i don't have the holy
[2:33:00] ghost
[2:33:02] i don't have the holy spirit if you stay
[2:33:04] on that mountain
[2:33:06] that mountain continually locks you in
[2:33:09] prison
[2:33:11] and tells you you're guilty you're a
[2:33:13] failure you're a sinner what's he
[2:33:16] telling you that this flesh
[2:33:19] can never make it
[2:33:24] but praise god for mount calvary
[2:33:30] because that's where he come and says
[2:33:32] the debt is paid
[2:33:34] i paid for it i've wiped it off your
[2:33:37] record don't look at yourself
[2:33:40] this way anymore i'm going to reveal to
[2:33:43] you the way to look at yourself that you
[2:33:47] were in me
[2:33:48] in the beginning
[2:33:52] look at yourself don't look at yourself
[2:33:55] from this mountain
[2:33:58] where if you stepped on it
[2:34:01] you died
[2:34:03] but look at it from this mountain
[2:34:07] look at it from the other mountain
[2:34:08] there's two mountains
[2:34:11] what is the rising of the sun
[2:34:14] it's the revelation
[2:34:16] of the mountain
[2:34:18] that gave you life
[2:34:23] that transforms you
[2:34:25] that allows him
[2:34:28] to come into you
[2:34:31] the very person
[2:34:33] that mount sinai condemned
[2:34:36] calvary
[2:34:38] paid the price
[2:34:39] and made the difference
[2:34:42] and set you free
[2:34:44] oh praise the lord
[2:34:49] there's a power
[2:34:53] there's a quickening power
[2:34:55] a power to bring you to life
[2:34:59] and next weekend we have a revival
[2:35:01] meeting
[2:35:02] but when we come back we'll start
[2:35:04] talking
[2:35:05] more
[2:35:06] about the power
[2:35:08] how it came from how god reveals it to
[2:35:11] us in the last day
[2:35:13] and what it's going to do for us
[2:35:15] what it has done and what it's going to
[2:35:18] do
[2:35:19] and how that we can become
[2:35:21] complete creatures in the statue of a
[2:35:24] perfect man by the spoken word of god
[2:35:27] god bless you 12 30.
[2:35:29] let's stand together this morning and
[2:35:39] i know many of us battle many things in
[2:35:41] the flesh
[2:35:42] but
[2:35:44] the scripture tells us that he's
[2:35:45] overcome them all
[2:35:47] right so let us show up bow our heads
[2:35:49] and if
[2:35:50] the musicians would play and
[2:35:53] before brother billy comes to close the
[2:35:55] service again this evening communion
[2:35:57] foot washing
[2:36:00] we'll go right into the communion and
[2:36:02] foot washing service after
[2:36:04] the song service and
[2:36:08] so you can go home if you would like to
[2:36:10] study along and
[2:36:12] take the
[2:36:13] message
[2:36:14] is the rising of the sun and
[2:36:17] mark out all the nuggets and things that
[2:36:20] you see and maybe some of us will align
[2:36:24] up or
[2:36:25] maybe new things will be opened and
[2:36:28] and we can just fellowship i love
[2:36:30] fellowshipping around the spoken word of
[2:36:32] god
[2:36:33] for the hour
[2:36:35] if you have a desire in your heart this
[2:36:37] morning if
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:41] you want to do better and
[2:36:45] you feel that
[2:36:49] there was a life that
[2:36:55] came forth
[2:36:57] out of the grave
[2:37:02] paid the price of sin
[2:37:05] and what was the wages of sin it was
[2:37:07] death
[2:37:09] so he paid the wages of sin
[2:37:13] and he died
[2:37:15] and they put him into the grave where
[2:37:18] he would be corrupted
[2:37:21] and go back to earth again
[2:37:24] but the word said i shall not suffer my
[2:37:27] holy one to see corruption
[2:37:30] and he came forth and proved to us
[2:37:34] and revealed testers life after death
[2:37:39] as our messenger said he proved that
[2:37:41] everything that he said
[2:37:44] was true beyond the shadow of a doubt
[2:37:48] [Music]
[2:37:50] he's here for your healing
[2:37:52] [Music]

[2:37:57] over the sin that so easily besets us
[2:38:02] he's here to give us peace that's your
[2:38:04] path understanding
[2:38:06] and joy unspeakable
