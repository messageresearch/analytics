that you may see the blood that was shed for us Lord God bless our gathering tonight we're so thankful for the word you spoken to us this morning and now we gather Lord once again for Fellowship in the evening time and we know father that's the time when you came down and you just spoke and Lord you came to hang out with your children we ask once again Lord that you just come and spend time with us for a little bit we love you and ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen so good to be gathered in the house of God Amen want to welcome everyone that's made an effort to be here amen I'm glad to be here and so uh let's open our Bibles uh in uh uh 1 John uh chapter 1 1 John the 1 chapter [Music] [Music] uh verse 7 it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we'll have Fellowship we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen gracious father we ask you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ pray amen man who try not to be too long I I've been trying to just be very efficient be delivered from the preacher syndrome you know to be able to just somehow speak one word and be understood you know um you know I believe it was a prophet's desire not to pray preach to long and I believe if I have that also it's not a bad thing I want to and I I trust you enjoy the word this morning you know I I've always said as a Christian I believe the word of God is given to to challenge us wherever we are I I don't ever want to get to a place where the word is preach and I feel like I'm satisfied that there's no improvement needed I've got it covered you know uh Trouble Comes when we get too comfortable you know it's when we sit around and we feel like we've made it and you know when we give ourselves various designations I'm the bride I'm this I'm this and I don't need to do anything that's when the devil is closer you know but it's when we take the word of God and we apply it and we continually Paul will say that I press towards the mark and it said I don't count myself having apprehended all things yet but I continue to press I believe that's the attitude of a Christian I you know you will hear so many times even the prophet on the tapes he'll be praying and says oh Lord even I lift my hand so I go if the prophet is lifting up his hand what should we do you know you will hear the the scripture will speak in reference to uh Jesus Christ being the the branch and it says if it was done to him how much more if it's done to us you know if he who was one with a father who knew everything and and he will come and he will cry out and say and and pray and go on the garden of Gan how much more us for the Fulfillment of what God has given us so I just pray that within our heart that we we have the attitude of always receiving the word of God and always challenging ourselves and that's how we can become successful as our Pastor said it this morning and and it this is just something that's been on my heart and and I told Brother David this morning I said he just went basically from Genesis to Revelation so I'll just repeat some of the things they said um and this has just been on my heart and um you know I know a pastor from the beginning of the year he's been talking about the way forward and and how to be successful in those things and and and all of that uh this has just been something that's been on my heart and I believe you'll probably go along the same way um and there's some similarity in what I have in my heart and my title tonight like I said I'll try to be uh uh very short on purpose my title tonight is uh uh God desires fellowship and not religion God desires fellowship and not religion um you know and and I that's say this is just even just for me because I believe sometimes the preaching is not necessarily to the people but you have to look inward you have to you a Believer after you've been in for a while you get to a place where you're just tired of religion you know and and there is a part of religion that's not bad per say you know we we have to have the church ordered they had to be in order in the way we do things and all of that but what we we do not want is to get caught up within that we we don't have to be caught up in uh how what how was the music where do I sit and I was not sit at the place that I all of those things of hey the preaching was it my taste was it not my because if you do that then you're missing the complete purpose of God the it's set up so we can have a certain order that things has to operate there's nothing wrong with that but we want to make sure that when we come to church we are actually in communion with God himself we we don't let people's personality uh uh uh hinder us we don't let the temperature in the room hander us we don't let the noise because of there's a baby crying over here or because of somebody how they're dressed and everything we don't let those things come into the way of what we came to receive and that's what I'm talking about it's a fellowship and and the prophet will talk and he will see and he will say that we we were made to Fellowship we were made to have Fellowship uh you know often time you know marvel how that we we can come to church and often time when service is over people will hang outside and perhaps with one two hours you know sometimes we are outside more than we are in the church and there's nothing wrong with that I'm saying that because to show you that there's something within the heart of men that desire to have Fellowship we like to talk with one another we like to get together we like to do those things and God made us that way it's not anything unusual like we we heard about the The Thirst and and all of those things so God made us so we can love Fellowship in fact God created man for the purpose of having fellowship with him and so he created us he made us we can come and we hear the word of God and and often time you know just thinking about what's going to come Monday you know the the thought about it just messes up your mind you want to have more Fellowship you wish you could spend more time together we love that more than we love anything why because we are made to be creatures of Fellowship we are made God made us that way and he he put in us a desire to have Fellowship God made us so we can have fellowship with him and with one another and and you cannot have Fellowship unless you have something in common uh you know but when I'm have say that they will say that if you find a a a young child with a grandmother something is wrong if you find them hanging around together something's wrong the grandmother must have something special for that kid and you know they we we our fellowship is around our interest you'll you'll find out that when we perhaps the the with the country we from the food we eat our interest the jobs our Hobbies those things creates the need for fellowship and perhaps we do the same type of things and all of that but our greatest Fellowship is around the word of God and I want to say and now has to be the most above everything else it has to be around the word of God uh I remember you know the a couple of years ago um uh we me and brother Mike were in the same room uh uh uh uh sitting around uh we had uh uh some meetings that our company had organized uh we were trying to modernize our Technologies and and the things that we do um uh uh and all of that so we invited some of the vendors people we do business with some of the people we buy stuff from and brother Mike's company was one of them in fact I think it was at the last minute that we find out that we were both going to the same meeting so we were sitting around and you know opposite from each other and we sat there and I went and I did a presentation and they were there in order for them to look at what we were're doing and all of the things and and and and be able to tell us what how we can improve the things that we were doing and all of that and and they came and you know after that you know they came and they went and buy us uh take us to the nicest restaurants around town and and pay our bills and all of that and and so we had fellowship and and and and and around work and everything and and and then couple of uh I believe it was a year or so later it was right here at church I don't I don't know if you you some of you remember we had an issue where uh we were being attacked my company we had a a Dos attack where they were just trying to take everything that we own out of from the internet so nobody can access it we had a lot of customers that were affected and and and so um we tried everything we spend the whole day working on it in fact I think after Sunday morning service I had to leave because it it just continually was happening and we try to call companies around to help us including B Mike's company and and and nobody would would would was able to do it fast enough they were telling us how many days and what we need to do and everything so I finally called bik and I said hey this is what we're going through don't you guys have a service that could um uh get us resolve this as quick as possible he said sure and and then uh a couple hours later I got a call from a VP from the company and I was able to set up meetings with our internal VPS and everything and and and the issue was resolved and right after the call the VP from my company asked me who did you call and I thought it pays to have Fellowship I want to say this Fellowship will save you when you need help Fellowship will come to your rescue when you really need it why that's why God wants us to be in Fellowship ship with him men wants a relationship where God is sitting up in heaven and and we are here down here when we need something we run and get it and we need something and even David will say the the unbelievers their children's stomach is full and they come and they they'll take from you and they'll go use for other purposes and they said but your children are hungry but he said but as for me I will look to your face until I become even like you so David had a pure desire in his heart he wanted Fellowship he didn't want the relationship with him and God to just be one that will come and take and go away but he wanted something permanent a God that he could walk up with a God that he can go to work with a God in fact banam speaks I believe in the message the unveiling of God he talks about this King he said there was a king and he said that one day he called all his people he says today is the last day you're going to see me on the throne and they they they asked him a question where are you going what's happening to you he said well today is the last day because what I really want to do as a king I'm tired of just sitting here I don't want to just sit here and you come and go you come and go I want to be the type of King that will go to work with you and a type of King that will go to school with you and a type of King that will be with you in the kitchen whatever you are doing I want to be the king that's walking with you God he he he has a concern about you he wants to know you better he wants to care about you whatever you're going through he wants you to talk to him about it he wants to help you in the situation you're going but man is designed this type of Kingdom where he's always wanting to push God far away man is the one who stole God he said don't speak to us let Moses speak to us it's man who wanted that why because he couldn't uh uh uh just helped to see God closer and closer but uh God's desire is always to be one with men I I was uh one day I believe I was listening to radio or my phone or something and I heard a man and I thought this was a perfect description of Fellowship he said uh there was a man a a man who came and he was giving his grandchildren uh uh gifts and they came and he offered one and he gave he gave them and then looked at the other the last one he told him it says you come to my house and I'll give you your gift and the other kids turned around and said why would you do that how come you calling him to your place he says first of all it's none of your business second of all he comes to my house when he doesn't need anything so I will give him whatever I want to give him in other word the other one had a relationship with him the other one knew something and when they told him you're going to come get your gift he knew what that meant but the others were concerned because they wanted a gift comparison they wanted to see which one gets the bigger but they had no relationship at all with him let me say this God wants us to have relationship with him fellowship and uh Fellowship is a god-given attribute let me say that we say that even human humanly speaking we find out that uh it's a characteristic that we were born with something that we desire to spend time together but when I will say it's two fellow is in one ship two fellow in one sh they can uh uh uh uh uh talk about anything understand each other you know often time when you don't know really well about somebody all you need to do is spend time with them often time we judge people by what we look and we see them a far off and we think and we have our own uh characteristic build about them but the moment we get to know them everything that we had in mind falls off and that's what God want we God don't want us to come in and and let me just say this uh religion as our Pastor said this this morning religion is a covering religion is a pretension it's trying to do something that you that you the trying to be something that you are really not it's finding human Comfort it it's trying to fit the pattern and with human effort religion is is is is the devil uh trying to get you to fell short of what true relationship and fellowship can produce and and and because remember the the prophet will tell us that if the devil can't get you on one side he will get you through the other so if he can't get you to be a complete unbeliever what is he going to try to do he'll try to make you a church member religion is a man coming up with a substitute to what the requirement is in other word what you have to be born again so religion looks it says okay what is it mean to be born again well you got to have this works you got to do so you try to run to the works and repr produ the work without the requirement of the new birth and and I'm speaking last because let me say this with sincerity within each one of us there's a measure of religion that we need to flash out there's a measure of an understanding that we've built about oursel but what we need is God to come and make himself real to us the word is given so that the spirit of God can come and Quicken it to your heart so God can become a reality we don't want the word to remain just it as an expression within our head we want that which we know to be made a reality into our lives so religion is is men's desire is men's desire to try to show that that he's doing something about it is man's and that's why I said to some measure there's nothing wrong with that but to stop there there's a problem with that because God is offering a relationship and if you stop in religion you're missing what God is offering so religion is man's desire trying to show that he's doing something is doing its part religion is is for show it is so that people can see that I'm religious look at the way I dress look at the way I talk and look at my understanding of the message look at this and let me say this with you having all of those attributes without the life it serves of nothing in fact they looked at the prophet and they looked at him and they said you don't even know your Bible he looked at him and says I don't know my Bible but I know my the author real well what we need is to know the author and the author will give you the interpretation now the knowing the author doesn't mean you don't need to read the Bible in fact knowing the author will cause you to read his word religion is is is for sure and and but Fellowship Is For Real it is somebody who's not ashamed is somebody who when they have a need they're not ashamed to say I have a need Lord and I want to be changed is somebody who desires to see the reality of God into their lives religion is is the disconnect between the requirement and the works it a a it bypasses what the requirement is to die and it goes right to The Works religion is to go back and look and say you know that's why says people will come and will say oh the question it says uh uh uh what is it that's required it says You must receive the new birth or the requirement be a Christian cannot lie cannot steal and everything and you work yourself so hard to fulfill those requirement oh I don't want to steal it I don't want to do this I can say this you can fulfill those requirements that still don't got it what you need is God by Fellowship to bring his word to come to pass in your life let me say this Fellowship will take you from where you are and bring you to the Finish Line Fellowship is God taking you the regardless of what happened to you regardless of whatever condition you were in and God himself by his Spirit causing you to stop those things yeah he said they asked a question uh how can I what what do I need to do to be born again he said they didn't tell them what they need to stop to do they told them what they were supposed to do that you must be born again because when you are born again you will stop all those things religion Fellowship Fellowship is established by revelation Fellowship is God and and for all of this I like I said I don't want to take too much time I'll just read quotes and quotes to to go through all of this Fellowship is established in Revelation is God bringing his word to come to pass in your life through Fellowship his Spirit working in you giving you what you need in order to overcome where you are weak he made strong and I can say this anybody who's ever been born again you know you didn't do it by your own strength anybody who's ever receive anything from God you know even right now you know that Lord if you leave me for one second I will fall if you stop for one minute I'll be nothing if you just stop for one second I'll be done all I am and everything I can do is only by your grace that's what relationship will produce you can stand there that's why the disciples you can see their action before and after on the on the other side they'll talk oh tell her to stop and over here they say why don't you call fire down to do this and everything but oh when they had that new birth and they come to the other side their conversation fully changed why because now they had the true relationship why the spirit that was in Christ was now in them and they can Now understand what he was talking about so God created men for Fellowship but when I'm will talk about in the beginning and you'll say God in the Garden of Eden and and and and forgive me if I I I seem to go through much in this because it's really the burden of my heart I can only speak what's on my heart and and I was just beginning he says in the beginning God created man in His image for the purpose of fellowship and and I thought about this now think about this God who's omnip present omnicient God who created Man In His Image came down every evening think about it now he already knew what Adam was doing he already knew but he came down every day in order to Fellowship to hear from the mouth of Adam what was happening he'll come down and sit and say tell me how was your day they say oh today you know we were walking and we saw that mountain we saw that tree and Eve you know were sitting there trying to just get the best view but there was a mountain and there was a tree on the way and we wanted to see better we just moved it a little bit to the side today when I was walking I saw this bunch of animal and I looked at them and I began to name them God looking at man and seeing the representation of himself and let me say this God could not have fellowship with men unless they had something in common what is it that they had in common man was made in the image of God let me say this you always have to know and remember that you are made in the image of God a man was made to talk like God to act like God to think like God his Fellowship was in the fact that they were one they were together in fact God was looking at man God himself looking at what he wanted to be you say God wanted to be man absolutely he always wanted God God is a family man God is not some M somewhere that wants to operate by themselves and and just be free and run around God wants to help people he wants to do good he wants to help he wants to lift up the needy he wants to help those that are down he wants to help he wants to see his family together often time we operate like individuals like people you know it seems like nobody has a burden and I'm not talking about you here people don't have like the burden of helping you know you you people just sit there to criticize oh that was not good that was not good what are you doing jump in and help jump in and assist whatever if if you saw it then you go do don't tell somebody else you go do it we we are above we are made to function together just because you think you're not part of the body it doesn't make you part of the body there's no Schism in the body we are made to work together God wanted he came every evening to talk with Adam and and and let me say this that hasn't changed that God wants to come this evening he wants to come to that now to talk to you and say that problem that you're going through that challenge I know about tell me about it he says I already know but I need you to tell me oh God you know I was trying to I've been trying to do this I can't he wants to have fellowship and let me say this your Victory will come through Fellowship we want to obtain Victory by religion God wants to give us Victory to Fellowship he wants to walk with us every step of the way until the results are brought forth Fellowship is trying to take God's power and use it however we want Fellowship is the at the the very characteristics the very nature of God residing in you so you know what to do with the word power aside from character is satanic so God came and made man made in the image of of God and and and in his likeness to have fellowship with him and and what they had in common was the fact that man was actually made in the image of God man was made in the image of God he was made to think like God to act like God he he didn't have religion back then he had Fellowship Adam didn't know what religion was until sin came in Adam had a mind of God because the scripture says when he named them God came and looked at him and says that's it he didn't wonder he didn't come to a place where he says well am I actually let me name them and then when God comes I'll ask if that's the name and then we'll figure it out no he was in full Fellowship The Same Spirit that was in God was in him what he desired was what God desired what what what he what his heartbeat was was he he and let me say this the motive was always love he didn't do it in spite he didn't do it in Revenge he didn't do it to hurt he didn't and that's the heart of God it it it's when you have that kind of heart you know we we hear the word like we heard this morning and and if you're not careful people don't don't understand that God is wanting to help us we we can't be slowful we can't just come and and and and remember that the the the word bam talks about how can I overcome it was the branch that sat in the water in the water that's supposed to give life it rotted right then and we don't want to rot right in church we want to bring life and God came down that evening and to fellowship with them even though God himself he knew and will say this I sorry I didn't take the title of the message but you can find it say so I can see Adam and Eve Eve going down through the garden and the winds blowing and the little bride saying Adam the winds is so strong and and and he will say peace see man was actually made to be God do you know that the Bible says Jesus says if they called them to whom the word of God came which were Pro which was prophit if they were if they were God then how can he condemn me when I say that I'm the Son of God the prophet were considered gods it says man was was was give men uh it says made a Lesser God as had given Dominion on the earth that's the reason that word that world that's the reason that the world today is groaning waiting for the full manifestation of the sons of God there's a great deep and blessed uh teaching uh in that it says that someday men man will still come back into his right place is and his dominion and will be on earth and he will speak to the tree or the mountain or to anything and he will he will go to his place just like he was intended to be we are Fallen creatures let me say this today the evening time message this end time message that we have received is come to restore you to that and we have seen it with our own eyes and let me say I begin to think yes God even the prophet will say God came in the Garden of Eden he will come and and now remember the fellowship with Adam was a very restricted Fellowship there were things that God could say that Adam in that state will not understand but when I will say God can come and say oh I'm A Healer Adam had no knowledge of that oh I'm a deliverer Adam could not fellowship with God into that but oh my brother my sister the fellowship at the end time is a much greater Fellowship why because the man that God had in the Garden of Eden had a limited Fellowship but at the end time it's a full Fellowship the fellowship that even angels had no idea what we are talking about now he he let the fall happen for the purpose of Fellowship just I I now I want you to understand how important Fellowship is to God he he doesn't want us you know I mean it's like you you take a kid and and and you just let him run around and you know with some power they're going to destroy everything it's through Fellowship that you bring them into understanding it's through Fellowship that you bring them to uh responsibility and obedience and understanding of what our power can do and and if we are looking for power without character without Fellowship then we fail to understand what really God God who defeated the devil in heaven God who defeated the devil at Calvary God wants to deil the devil in your body he he doesn't want you to go do it by yourself he wants to be in you doing the same thing yes sir that's true Fellowship but I'm say when man fall after that they were sitting there and and it said that then God heard the news that man had fallen he he didn't say Angels you go look and and go tell me what's happening but man says God himself he came down now I want you to remember right before that Lucifer sined and he was kicked out in fact God didn't even look at his face he saying angels to go deal with that but when man fall he didn't send no angels He didn't send anybody he himself came down because of the fellowship and he he's asking as if he didn't know Adam what happened who who did this to you he he you could see the heart of God he he cared he he wanted that he had Fellowship what happened to you who told you you were naked and the prophet will say God he he looked at it now when he told them that if you eat you shall die he never added anything to it that was it but the moment it actually happened but what I'm say that God right away he not willing to be defeated he made a way he made a way why because the fellowship was so dear to him the fellowship was so important to him he made way and he said and I saw love come down in the form of L he takes a lamb and he slays him and he takes a skin and he wraps them and he watches them walking with the skin slapping on their legs and the scripture will say that then he stopped them and he said I made he said I put imity between thy seed and the woman's seed why God making a way that Fellowship will be restored one day God making a way to know that you didn't go I I I let you go I'm watching you go but the same way I'm watching you going I'm going to make a way so you can come back what love and let me say this we we say love love requires Fellowship to to say you love someone and not have a relationship or a fellowship what is it called illusion it's an illusion love demands that something may be done love is there to establish and and to be put forth and to show that what I'm talking about is real love has Works attached to it but oh my the scripture says that they with their mouth they Proclaim but their hearts have fall from me with their mouth they'll say Lord I love you and Lord I worship you but their heart is far from me who did that religion did that religion did that but so it's in the Bible that says they will stand up like the uh I'm sorry I was to say republican but the the publicans they stand there in the synagogue and speak about oh holy is me look at me and I've done this I've done this and they're not speaking the truth they just did it for show how can it be that when they claimed to have waited for him when he showed up they didn't even give him one second but true love requires Fellowship I begin to think about J oh my oh job and and and and he was there h i I tell you this I I was reading it and it just came to my heart job needed something that was more than religion the the word told them that oh you know when you do wrong when something happen just go offer sacrifice just go offer and they your sin will be forgiven and he did it and he worked but something happened that job knew that even My Sacrifice I need something more than that let me say this things happen in our lives where we realize I I I go to church and I do all I pay my tithes I pay my offering but that's not enough I I I you know I do all that I can and I pray and I do that but I need a god with skin on him that's a desire of a True Believer I want something that I can touch I want somebody I can speak to who can speak back to me I want a god with skin on him we we cannot let me say and and God you you couldn't have that desire unless God placed it in you don't thinking strange don't I mean let me say this if nobody else desires it you desire it you go after it yes sir don't don't be ashamed and don't feel like anybody is restricting you if you desire god with skin on him you ask for it job offer the sacrifice and we understand we know the story very well and after he's done that and and and and and everything and his soul began to desire more than that he was no longer happy you know these friends came and accused him and everything and I love how the Bible says Joel began to he cursed the day that he was born and and he says oh that I may know where he lives that I may go up to his door and knock on it and and sit down with him and and put words in my mouth and argue with him and and let him tell me the reason why all of this is happening he wanted a God that he can communicate with a God that can understand him and he can understand that God but what says that job wanted a god with skin on him that job wanted H he calls it a go between somebody who can understand the issues of man isn't that what we desire and that's you that desire is there so God can fulfill it The Thirst is there so God can fulfill it he doesn't want us to come to church and become a church member and pay our tithes and pay our offering and come Wednesday come Sunday and that's the extent of our fellowship no he wants to talk to you every day when when you leave your home don't leave him in your house take him with you when we come to church I hope we're not just coming to find him I I was talking with the brother and I said you know the problem is you know and and I always say this we are all Catholics somehow we are being taught from a young age that religion is that we come the responsibility is given upon the preachers and everybody that comes out here I just come and pay my ties and watch everything unfold that that that I think that's the the that's how we are raised and and it's part of every organization it's part of it but if you go back to the true church that God began he wasn't a people that was just got a it was everybody had a testimony to bring everybody who came in had been touched by God they knew what God was in fact they knew so that if you came and said something that was not it they would know that what you're talking about is not it it wasn't built by intellect it was a bunch of people some couldn't write their names and some couldn't spell it but they knew one thing is they had met God Amen why it was fellowship and I want to say this I I that's what I want within my life and my heart I want Fellowship I'm tired of religion I'm I'm tired of this circle of doing and I want within the operation of the things that God wants us to do I want to see him manifested I want to see him appearing I want to see him move I want to see him I want to touch him I want to see him in my brother I want to see him in my sister I want to see him operate I want to see him functioning within the body God himself education will produce religion but revelation will produce Fellowship religion is man trying to fight follow the word of God and trying to fulfill the word the best that they can but Fellowship is God bringing his word to come to pass in you God making himself known unto you let me say this I was thinking about this it said oh my when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me religion came and said this man wants us to be vampires what now think about think about it so religion wanted to actually make himself more holy than the word was Revelation looks at him Fellowship looked at him and said I don't know what you're talking about but one thing I know is it's you that has the words of eternal life when Jesus said who do men say that I am religion looks at him and say well read in the Bible some say you are Jeremiah some say you are some type of prophet and you are some kind of John the Baptist plus two number two or something like that and that's kind of what I see and that's what I understand but oh my fellowship looked at him and he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God let me say this Revelation or Fellowship will give you the right answer every time because why Fellowship will bring you close to him religion will drive you away from him we we we don't pay attention that it it's the devil's tool that he trying to bring within our minds and and and and is trying to cause us to to to to to REM remember but say this a as long as you can Proclaim within your mouth every time all you do is just an empty confession the devil is there taking a nap and is perfectly fine with it I'm a Christian well as long as there's no Works attach to it it's fine right oh I'm a bride go on you know I'm the second coming of Jesus yeah no problem but the moment life appears now he can no longer sleep now he's got to get to work why because what he's afraid of it's not what you say what he's afraid of is you having a relationship with that word and that word operating in you we we can make all the claims there were those that made claims remember the scripture speaks about the son of skas right we know Jesus we speak in the name of Jesus it says Jesus yeah you know Jesus now these are the demons speaking right he says we know Jesus the demons had better understand of Jesus than they did of Jesus Jesus we know Paul we know who are you I don't ever want to be in that situation see they lack Fellowship they lack relationship they just went and took some Bible some word somewhere and a bunch of religious people and went around claiming to have been with Jesus and I think we have to be careful sometimes to oh I'm a message believer what life are you living you know I that's why the prophet said I'd rather have the right Spirit and the right Doctrine why because I want the spirit that was in Christ to be in me if I have his Spirit he will teach me and guide me in all truth and righteousness so I know what to do but we can make claims and not be able to back it up I'm sorry I went be it's easy to say when you're sitting there so it it's the relationship and and and the prophet will speak it says so the the it's love requires uh uh Fellowship when when you love something or you love someone it has to uh bring you in relationship with that person so that that because of the fall of Man God provided a place of fellowship and and let me say this it it was by the blood that God provided the place of Fellowship under the shed blood and it doesn't matter what condition you are in God provided a place that he can meet you yes right and and let me say this that's why it's so important that we fail in love with Fellowship because God is not judging us for what we are or what we have done what he's wanting us to do is regardless of what situation we find ourselves he's saying that I'm willing to have fellowship with you in fact I have a provided place that I want you to be so I can have fellowship with you you you you know what whatever you're going through you're struggling with something God is here to say that I have provided the shed blood so I can come that through Fellowship I can bring Deliverance you you you you you're lacking the Holy Spirit God is saying that I have provided the shed blood so when you come under the shed blood I can come in and give you the holy spirit so it's not oh oh I I I'm not made or I can't have Fellowship no it's to say that regardless of what situation we are in whether we have the Holy Spirit we don't whatever we are we have we come with the understanding that God is providing a place where we can have fellowship with him he doesn't want us to walk out of here as educated Believers and those are the tough ones to save because now they know how to defend themselves you know they come educated and they go out educated everything you you tell them they find a way to spin it around we want to humbly come and say Lord I have need of you and I want to just be honest I say this I don't know how you know someone cannot need the Holy Spirit every day and I'll just say for me I pray for the Holy Spirit every day Lord I need your spirit I I've always feel like I don't have enough Lord I need more why because with all that's happening with all that we have to deal with if you don't have his Spirit you can survive hey don't don't be ashamed if you need something don't don't because he's wanting through Fellowship he can give it to you a church is not built so we can come and say I got it who's got it who doesn't got it that was not the purpose it's a place so we can come under the shed blood and whatever we have need of is here to provide it where we can come and be honest with ourselves and say Lord I have need of you I've messed up over here I've messed up over there a Christian shouldn't do this and shouldn't do that I don't want to go fix it by myself I need your spirit to help me walk in it who who we fooling and but if a person doesn't have the relationship then all it becomes is a book of law oh H they told me not to do this oh this is not do oh this is not do or or they go and accumulate at teaching and figure out within themselves how am I going to fit him like our Pastor said the puzzles trying to feed ourselves in something that we were not made to be you know I'm starting to realize even through The Thirst that the message that our pastor went through that even all the desires that comes in you God let them happen for a purpose God is really wanting to have Fellowship with you you go and be honest and say Lord I have this desire in me it's not according to you how can I do this how am I going to deal with it and through that through Fellowship he can take it and mold it you know the one who God God made you to be a certain nature you don't go and say God I don't want to be this nature I want to be like that one no through Fellowship he will bring you into what he wants he made you thus for a reason he he has a place for you he has a place that you would fit perfectly but if he makes you like that one then you won't fit it but you couldn't know it just by me talking it's by Fellowship it's by Fellowship but one of them will say he will say he talks about the church the World Council of churches it says that's why they are fighting and and uh over to them eles and they are cutting throats and how they can how they how can they even get Fellowship it says when when people in there are trying to even believe in God he says infidels and everything else he says how can Jesus says how can the two walk together except they agree how can they do it they only there's only one way to walk with one uh with with with another man it says that's when you agree with him so so so how are you going to cut off in denomination and so forth and make an agreement when when one separates himself from the other and yet God wants us to Fellowship he says there's something in US think about this there's something in us to make Fellowship man is always wanting to Fellowship wanted to do it but he's always trying to achieve by his own knowledge how to bring how to bring it and he will never be able to do it that's right you'll never be able to do it you we can never quench the true thirsty of Fellowship that God is placed in Us by our own selves he's placed it so we could bring it to him and let him do it for us so we can bring it under the shed blood and let him through Fellowship let me say this when you have Fellowship there's such an understanding you know that's why Jesus could speak in Parables and others are looking and losing their minds about it but those that had fellowship with him they'll just wait when everybody else is losing a money say oh no don't worry about it he's going to tell us yeah how did Abel know what to do when they were given the same exact instructions same exact instructions one goes doeser one way and the other does it the other way and God looks at one and says I'm not going to take yours I'll take the others yeah wait a minute you told me to do this the first fruit of what you do and this is what I did but the problem is one had fellowship and they matched something that was already existing and the others was just a reproduction of his own religious belief that's why we don't believe the word the word of God we it's it's by Revelation it's not you going to read the letter the scripture did Paul said that the letter kth but the spirit giveth life the the the churches that are around the corner is the same Bible is the same they read the same Bible that we read how can they come up because they lack Revelation they lack an understanding they like a fellowship that would open it up to them so it's not the the the actual action of just reading but it's the fellowship that comes to help you understand what you are reading the unic read the Bible but it took one to come and explain to him what he was reading but it couldn't be done unless be by fellowship and the prophet will say it says there there's only one there's only and a continuation of the same it says there's only one place of genuine fellowship and that's under the shed blood of an innocent it says there's only one way we can have it it says we would have to uh uh we would have fellowship with every Church uh uh would be a Lutheran if every Church would be a Baptist or so forth we could have Fellowship under the denomination right but it says there's only one way we can have it we would have fellowship with every uh every Church would be a Lutheran or or every or or if it would be a Baptist or so forth or or so forth we could have Fellowship under the denominational rights but it says but who reads the Bible knows that these things makes uh make us disagree it says now there's only one thing we can have Fellowship under I is like we said here tonight Methodist Baptist Lutheran and whatever more we we it says when we are under the shed blood of an innocent it says that was God's requirement and God never does change his program when God wants make a decision he has to uh forever remain with that decision it says now he's infinite we are not infinite we are mul of things so forth we are we are finite so we cannot we can be we we cannot be infinite so then when we uh it says so then we make promises we make promises you have to break them you do something today and tomorrow you'll know more about it so you C you so you can you can do it better tomorrow he says next year you still do it better than you did that day because you learn more about it because you are finite bound to uh this little uh tree Dimension that that we live in but God is infinite therefore God can speak once and his decision is perfect think about it and he can it says and can never change and that's the reason my faith is build on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way then is All My Hope and stay for on Christ the solid Ro the solid rock I Stand All Out the ground and seeking sand and Christ is the word I love that because the denominational understanding had made Christ to be anything oh is this and is that but Christ is word is the word and is the word upon he said that heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away not a word it says not one word can fail because his God because it's God's word you cannot and in the last in the last book of the revelation he says whatsoever shall take one word or take away or take out of this or add one word to it the same will be taken out his part from the book of life therefore any Creed anything else that would add any to the word of God or take anything out of it it's death to it's death to do so like it was to Eve in the beginning it's death penalty to take or add just take it the way it is it says the Bible says it's no private interpretation it's already uh interpreted just read it and believe it God watches over his word to keep it therefore his word therefore it is therefore it his word what we do uh what we have to stand on and let me say this Revelation and the prophet will say this I believe in Christ The Mystery of God revealed Revelation through Fellowship causes God to whisper to his elect the secret of what he's doing think about it the reason why you know what he's doing is because he's Whispering secrets to you that others don't know about is God himself making himself known by Revelation and helping you so you can make it religion is man trying to interpret the text for himself and coming up with his own interpretation if the musician could come like said I didn't want to be too long and the question is why do we need Fellowship I want to say this in Fellowship we receive spiritual strength and Revelation to know just how to use the word of God and how to overcome the scripture will say in first Thessalonians 5:1 it says wherefore Comfort yourself together and edify one another in Fellowship there's God support he's he's there to carry you over so you not only know what you're supposed to do but it's God helping you so you can get to the destination Fellowship brings Unity you know it's marvelous because bam will take this and I don't have time but he will compare it to um a person being married it said that we live in the three-bedroom house you compare it even to the Tabernacle you had the uh the outer Court the inner court and the holies of holies we understand that through that process one that would come and uh if you come to the outer Court you were subject to whatever the weather was if it was hot or cold or rainy or whatever but when you went into the holy place the you were subject to the candlesticks and that was the type of relationship you had and and it was always in need constantly in need of the water uh I'm sorry of the oil for the cand stick to continue to burn but when you went into the holy of Hest the relationship changed and and when you enter in there everything that happens outside didn't bother you anymore and I want to say this and I just thought within my own heart the way forward if we really want to move forward we desire a greater relationship let that that I I I don't want to be bothered about what's happening out there I don't want to be bothered by politics I don't want to be be bothered by anything I don't want to be bothered by the unbeliever I don't want to be bothered by any I want to have fellowship with you and you alone and that's the end of the story you say well you don't care about politics you know you don't want to talk about the Pres well if you talk about the president you got to talk about the Senators you got to talk about this you got to talk about everything and and you know it's almost like trying to say oh you you know this has to be fixed that has you can't fix everything everything what you need is relationship with him so he can keep you going politics is not going to keep you going right and trust me your job is not going to keep you going what we need is fellowship with him and and so we need and he will talk about it's a it's a it's a relationship he says now when you come it's like a man being married if you come in and you are sitting in the the kitchen it says that's really not Fellowship it says that's just you come in it's the beginning of Fellowship it's like one come to church to believe the word of God that's just the beginning and then you move there you go into the living room and you eat there you fellowship and all of those things and you will talk that's not the fullness of Fellowship the fellowship happens in the bedroom where it move from fellowship into you become one with one another that's the fullness of Fellowship where says that's where we need to be we need to become one with Christ it it's not given to just come and and and then just come and we we hear the word of God but what God is Desiring and let me say this I said it before it's what it desired from the beginning of creation is so that he can have a full fellowship with you where we can have life his life in us that we can bear for fruits that are that are going to look like him we can do the works that he did we can do everything that he did and become one with him that's the kind of Fellowship he want he doesn't want us to be educated Believers he wants us to have Fellowship I'm walking with him when he talks to me I listen and I do it I I don't know much I don't know anything but every moment he talks to me I want to do what he wants me to do it doesn't matter what people think about me I care more about what he thinks about me than you are in fellowship with him let's all [Music] stand Fellowship to bring us in unity because the scripture says that we have fellowship with him and we have fellowship with one another we couldn't our fellowship with one another wouldn't work unless we have fellowship with him first because have me fellowship with him first Smooths out everything if we just to create fellowship with one another my goodness we'll see all the mistakes look at that one and it's you know and then before for too long you know you look and said oh you know that one is not doing this and and then you know you move from what they're not doing to what they're supposed to do and what they should be doing but if you have fellowship with him then he allows you to look at the other one and pray for them because remember butam said that Jesus asked for one thing that the same Fellowship that he had with the father that you would have access to that same Fellowship ship when we meet a sinner what we desire is not for him to know all the word of God is so that the fellowship the same God who touched us the same God can touch them if if you want to just blow the minds with the scriptures it's not going to be helpful you're going from the standpoint of what was done to you and Jesus prayed and he said father if I'm going to do this there's one thing I asked that you may allow them that the same Fellowship I have with you that they may have access to that same fellowship and God said I'll give it to you and that's why the scripture the prophet will come and he said that the same Fellowship it says the same Harmony that existed between God and Christ that same Harmony is now existing between Christ and his bride why because it can only come when we are under the same Fellowship under the shed blood that's where that could come for our gracious father we're so thankful Lord for your word and Lord [Music] we always look at your word and within our heart with desire Lord and the Heart of every True Believer is always Desiring more and of the closeness and more of the one oness with you Lord and and father we're just speaking from my heart and tonight and Lord I desire a closer Fellowship a closer walk with you [Music] and father not just speaking it but really Desiring that the union that you promis in the end time that will be one as you are one father that we may walk in it father that we can have your eyesight your way of viewing things and father when we look at in the scripture it's so amazing how you just kind of knew what to say and knew what to do under circumstances and you just had the perfect words for every circumstance you just knew the perfect thing to do under every circumstance Father a true born again son and the daughter desires the same thing Lord we know that challenges are going to come we know the circumstances are going to arise but father what we desire Above All Things is just to have the same nature that same characteristics that same spirit that was in you Lord to dwell in us and to do the same thing oh God help us I pray Lord father I believe it with my heart that we couldn't desire it unless you were here to to give it to us so we pray tonight I lift my hands and say Lord just help us where we are weak oh God and Father come and be one with us and make yourself real in every aspect of our lives and Lord that those that are around us and at our jobs and our work everywhere and at home and that they may look at us and really see Christ Living in US that they may know father that we may be those that can really project and show that the characteristics and the nature of Christ lives in us we commit what we are into your hands father we're so thankful for everything you do father bless our pastor and his heart's desire Lord to just keep us in unity and in your word and I pray father you just strengthen him and even give him abundant Revelation and the leadership and the direction that you're taking us I believe this is for a purpose Lord and I believe with with all my heart Lord is uh it's because we want to really be real Lord in everything that we do we desire to see the true nature and characteristics of the Bride being manifested in us that's why we cry out to you we pray father that because only you can fill it only you can can quench it so therefore we cry out to you that you come and do it according to your promise be with us I pray father we commit the remaining of the service into your hands and father as we are dismissed we C that Lord you walk with us every step of the way we love you and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's just sing now amen oh sh with God in a secret place oh there in the spirit hold [Music] his new power to run the [Music] our to be shut in sing it again oh with God in a sec there is the spirit behold in [Music] his power to run in the I to be [Music] sh Hallelujah I trust we all enjoyed that tonight you know it truly spoke to my heart you think about it with the sermons that our pastors been preaching and the the ministry's been preaching success of the believer and what brother Billy just preached just now about Fellowship
