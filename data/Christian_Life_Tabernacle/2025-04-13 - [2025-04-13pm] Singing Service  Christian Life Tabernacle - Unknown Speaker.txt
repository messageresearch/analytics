Let Israel rejoice in him that made him. Let the children of Zion be joyful in the king. Let them praise his name in the in the dance. Let them sing praises unto him with temporal and harp. Let the Lord take pleasure in his people. Let his beautiful meek with salvation. He said, "Let the saints be joyful in glory. Let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let it said, "Let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hands to execute vengeance upon the uh heathen and punishment upon the people to bind the king with chains and the noble with feather of iron. to execute upon them the judgment written. This honor have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord. Amen. Isn't that wonderful that we can come in as we're singing and praising him? He's giving us victory. He's binding the chains of our enemy and he's taking care of all that we have need of. Why? Because we've come to praise him. Amen. Our gracious father, we just want to commit this singing service into your hands. Father, we're so thankful that you spoke to us this morning. And father, we took time to just have fellowship and eat and father get to know one another better. Lord, we want to just commit this now, this time of singing into your hands. Father, your prophet told us that we can get deliverance in singing. Father, we can come and get our healing and just praising your name. We know, Father, we don't wait to see it with our eyes, but we know that just praising you, Lord, for what you already promised. All the promises in the Bible are already done. It's already given. and we can just thank you for that and know that you'll do the same. We commit everything to you and we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. God bless you. And I have your seats. Amen. We have a lot of specials. I'm looking at the number of people. I'm looking at the number of requests. Seems like the request have multiplied. Amen. We have a an announcement here. Um there are pens of leftovers uh uh of beans and also iced tea uh for anyone that wants to take it um after church. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

I have a very special uh request up here from brother David Jr. so we'll have him the first. Amen. Amen. After that, brother Steve, you can bring your special. Amen. It's not every day that brother David Jun sings song. There's a reason. Um, it's a song we sung before and uh it's on free if you could go ahead and put the words up. But just I appreciated the song brother Billy opened the other night with. It was just recently uh within a little family chat we had. We had a testimony sent our way and it was a brother Ron gave a testimony how he just had a scan and it came back clean and started to think we me and Julie just started to worship the Lord there laying on our beds. We started to praise the Lord and the presence of the Lord drew near and you know you have to have joy in your life and uh you know our pastor was saying a thought that inspired him was if you want to grow you have to have joy and one of the things that Satan tries to rob from you is the joy of your salvation. And if there's anything I hope that we all could enter in and sing together it's a song about being free. And just let that sink in for a moment. You're free. Praise the Lord. You're free. You're no longer bound. There there's no chains holding you. If you want to praise him, you can praise him. There's there whatever the hindrance would be, it's it's broken. You have a complete liberty in Christ Jesus to thank him. There's things he's he's doing, saints, that he's worthy of the praise. He's he's worthy of our thanksgiving, and you're the only one who can give it. He's desirous that those who would worship him would worship him in spirit and in truth. And their rock is not our rock. That you're the only one who can worship him in this hour in the spirit and the truth and the life we have. So there's the sermonet. That's a little get me inspired to sing a little bit and let's sing this together. Hallelujah. Okay. Well, I'm free. Oh, praise the Lord. I am free. No longer bound. Well, there's no chains holding me. My soul is resting. It's such a blessing. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. I'm free. till I'm free. Oh, praise the Lord. I am free. I'm no longer bound.
