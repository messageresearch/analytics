promis that you'd be with us Lord so we're committing this service to you that father one touch from you will leave and no longer be the same and Lord this is the way you move this is the way you operate and you have not changed you're the same yesterday today and forever so father we're committing this service to you that you would anoint us and speak to your people father in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you Saints if you would turn with me in your Bibles to Luke we want to thank the sound booth for for working through the fire um I know what it's like to be in the hot seat and uh so thankful that uh we're no longer in that seat but uh can appreciate each effort that's made and want to thank them uh going to look in Luke Chapter n we're going to read in verse uh starting in verse 51 and if I had a title or a way to carry the thought and just I inspiration that's that struck me I couldn't get it away from my heart but it's next year Jerusalem and as our pastor would Minister and say there's a path forward it caused me to contemplate what is it that we're looking to what is it that we're focusing on and uh just the theme next year Jerusalem resonated in our hearts and I in looking this scripture uh the Lord brought me to it quite sof Sly and I we'll take our text from here and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to Jerusalem and sent Messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem and when his disciples James and John saw this and and they said Lord wil thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked them and he said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of for the son of man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went to another Village and I'm going to read even while you're standing it's a short quote but I fail to read it part of the text it's in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever uh in 61 and I don't know if the paragraph number is entirely correct but I have 11 I think when Solomon built the first temple it was cut out from all over the world shipped in cut out from the queries and from The Cedars cut up at Lebanon and floated down to japa and hauled by an oxcart and so forth and it was so masterly built that when the temple went together it had all kinds of little funny looking stones in it and when he began to read the blueprint it was all in the blueprint and there was not even a buzz of a Saul or a sound of a hammer for 40 years in the building the Temple I think that's the way God his people all cut out one's got a nature one kind one another but they're all Christians fitted Stones joined together upon the Chief Cornerstone Christ Jesus oh there's the main thing so many re reject the precious Cornerstone where we're all built together cemented together with God's love that's right God's love and when we have that there's nothing will separate us there's nothing can divide us as long as we love one another I've been a minister for 31 years I've seen all kinds of gifts I've seen God do great things but the the greatest thing I could ever seen in my life was love it's the most powerful force that stops anything there is is love love that moved a mighty God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son love is the keynote thing we leave out it's something that's Eternal God bless you you can have your seeds ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word and as we read that quote and looking at Jerusalem Jesus Christ to the scripture said he set his face to Jerusalem and if you read in the scripture where we took our text in Luke it's quite a lengthy chapter chapter nine a lot of things are transpiring in that chapter uh Jesus is talking to his disciples he's trying to tell them I'm going to be delivered unto man this is after Mighty Miracles and he's letting him know I I evil men are going to to take me and you're going to see them uh if it enforce their will upon me and and Jesus knowing the hour that had been that had come he had been on Mount Transfiguration the disciples had seen him uh radiate with the glory of God and now he's coming to a place where he set his face to Jerusalem and it is a very deliberate look it's a very specific focus and he he's so uh focused on going to Jerusalem that when he came to a village in Samaria if you read it if you just follow along and it they did not receive him in verse 52 and he sent Messengers before his face and they went and entered into the village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they the scripture would say that even though he was coming by their way they didn't make ready for him they didn't receive him because it was the the effect of his face being so focused in the intent of of his heart being made known that he's not going to T he's going to Jerusalem they didn't receive them and I find that uh is the inspiration that that strikes me is when people understand what your focus is that's where the separation takes place and it you got to have a singularity in heart you have to be there has to be something that binds our hearts together in love there has to be something that makes that effectual and I would say that it's Jerusalem it's that we are the body of Christ it's that there is a place where Mercy is found there's a a place where judgment is met out there is there is a a focus of our affection and just as Christ would represent that in the way he would turn his face to Jerusalem he's been given to us as an example as we would just uh follow along I think we'll see that if you turn in Hebrews I'm glad they got the screens working I hope you could read this with me uh Hebrews chapter 12 verses 2 and 3 I I'm take I want to do the reading from the Amplified verse version uh and you can follow along in the King James version and I I do believe we have the ability if not um I'll read it to you in the way the Amplified presents it uh looking away from all that will distract to Jesus who is the leader and the source of our faith giving the first incentive for our belief and it is also the finisher bringing to maturity and to Perfection he for the joy of obtaining the prize that was set before him endured the cross despising and ignoring the shame and is now Seated on the right hand of the Throne of God the with anything that is going to be deliberate with anything that's going to be a focus there's going to be a distraction there's got to be something that is going to come and Buffet you that's going to come against you and try to take your distraction it's and be a distraction and take your focus from the main thing and and and you think about how much of this really this isn't trivial the shame that he bore the things that would be there that would seem to be the what would be deserving and especially in our hierarchy of needs would deserve the the greatest care and focus he's Jesus Christ is Now setting those seeks aside because you are on his mind he understands that there has to be some a pride that has to be obtained and the and the and that is what is compelling him through this hour through this travail and the scriptures admonishing you just as Christ could do that that is the same thing that allows you to overcome in your hour is to have a Clear Vision to have an understanding of what you're contending for and the devil would tell you and I believe it was in Pilgrim's Progress there was a I I forget the guy's name but one of his primary tactics was to tell him there is no Celestial City there's no prize and there's no hell just just relax nothing's at stake here nothing's critical just take your time everything's going to be okay uh there's another hour uh this is more important uh the things of the Earth are more critical I'm telling you uh you really need to figure out this but if your affections are set upon the Heavenly if you've if you know what the Heavenly prize is is that nothing can distract you from that and and that actually becomes the critical piece here you have to know it's real and and as long as you don't know it's real you can be held between two opinions if you're if you're failing to overcome there is a reality where Jesus Christ can become real to you and that prize becomes tangible and and I would say if if you find yourself not over me there's a greater revelation of Jesus Christ that you can have the prize that's set before you and that will give you such a love for him that it can give over it imparts an overcoming power uh just continuing to read in verse three just think of him who endured from Sinners such Grievous opposition and bitter hostility against himself reckon upon and consider all in comparison with your trials so that you may not grow weary or exhausted losing heart and relaxing and figing in your minds you know you have a spirit we would say our minds brother Brandon would give us a glimpse into the spirit each of you have brought an atmosphere you've brought a spirit even though you have a soul there is an atmosphere that you're walking in your spirit and it is impacted by the things that are around you and sometimes it's in the singing it's in the songs it's through a testimony it's through a burden it's through a need that we get impacted in our Spirits we can we can catch the burden of somebody in the body and that causes a paradigm it causes a shift we're no longer looking at ourselves we're no longer looking at our needs but we're minded for the body that's the greatest atmosphere changer is when you recognize what's at stake for the body of Jesus Christ your attitude matters how you came in mattered what you're focusing on what you're thought is what your heart's meditation is where your mind is at it matters it and where your heart is where your mind is that's where your treasur is at what what are the things that we're treasuring where is our where is our minds at and there should be you know when you when you go to communion it says discern the body many are weak and sickly money among you not Discerning the Lord's body when we come together to commune at his table when we come to sit in the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus when we come to Feast on the things of God we should be Discerning the needs of the body there should be a pull there should be a desire there should be Lord pass by my way Lord I know that someone needs a touch from you I need you real now and that is the greatest atmosphere changers that there is the most powerful weapons is the love that you can have for the body first Peter chap 2 veres 1-6 would read wherefore laying aside all malice and Gile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so by ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious and I I that strikes me there's a prerequisite here if if these things are not happening if you're not laying aside the malice or the Gile the hypocrisies the envies and all the evil speaking and you can't become sincere for the milk of God maybe you haven't tasted that the Lord is gracious if so be you've tasted that the Lord great is gracious and and there's a there's Honey in the Rock my brother have you tasted that the Lord is gracious he's wondrous kind and true there's Honey in the Rock my brother there's Honey in the Rock for you there has to be something that says what God's done for me he could do for you and that if without that there is no there is no ability I would tell you there's really just not the ability to set aside the envying The Strife you can't give what you ain't got if you're find finding it hard to overcome and forgive you don't know what it's like to be forgiven I mean we're not playing church or playing religion there is an overcoming power that's real and and the lack of it shows a lack of experience and and we're and we're not there's no delusion here you know when you become disheartened and and and uh the way to break a man's spirit is is to set a a prize or a goal and then tell him he can't obtain it you can't have this and what strikes me about that many years ago I came across the statistic I don't know exactly what it was but it caused me to ponder and the numbers would convey that that suicide rates amongst Native American Youth and uh Native alaskans are the highest of any demographic for teenagers in the hundreds of a percentiles in certain demographics and it and it struck me I was like why is that and you talk about something that is glorified and and I it's worthy of it the life that they had before we came the Renegade came they had what many long to have freedom they were one with nature the their livelihood just depended on what God gave them and even if they looked it at the things that were visible to him and Seed God in them and worship the creation more than the Creator they in many ways are more contact with God than most people are today and I it struck me that it's like they have a vision something they would want to obtain something they've been told that they are it's who you are it's your culture this is your heritage yet they can't achieve it it's been taken from them what we've done to this country what we've done to the land they'll never go chase the Buffalo everything that they have an identity that they that the world would tell them they are they can only do in mooms and semblances but they never could achieve the dream and to me that's why there's such a delusion but when we look at the phrase next year Jerusalem there's something that there's another group of people that are longing for something this phrase is not one you'll find I believe in the in the Torah or in the in the in the Bible but it's a it's a phrase that's common amongst the Jews they say it every year at yon Kapur a couple of times at different feast and they say next year Jerusalem and now that they're in Jerusalem they say next year Jerusalem rebuilt because there's a vision of atonement there's a vision of reconciliation there's a vision of redemption they believe that one year that Temple is going to be rebuilt so this is a people that if you look uh there's something that has met their hearts together there's something that gives them a singleness and that's what they have in common is Jerusalem now if we could catch that I it it should help us because we are now in in Jerusalem just uh bear with me I had a scripture and it it I believe it's uh Hebrews 12: 22 says but ye are come into Mount Si and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an inumerable company of angels so the prize that we now have is we have been ministered and entrance into Jerusalem this is not something that's not obtainable but you're being told now you're already in an inumerable company of angels it kind of reminds me of Elias when when he Elijah when he's sitting there and the the Syrian King is is worried that there's one that knows the very secrets and the intents of the heart and it and I believe it was brother Billy said it the other day one with God is a majority cuz when God's on your side you're with an innumerable company of angels and and God even said your enemies will be my enemies so there's a faith and there's a vision there has to be an understanding that you are the elect of God that you have been called into a holy Jerusalem that you are a people fitly joined together bound together in love and that election that placing that that deliberate thought that God had of you is a strength that's right that is a who God is for that is a declaration of who you are and and and that's faith in who you are and what's the what's the distraction what's the delusion that something else defines you besides God's election that's the only thing that defines you that's the I you start to meditate upon God's Sovereign Grace in your life you can truly say whatever state I'm in I'm content as long as I know God's with me take this world take the Treasures of the world the greatest treasure I have is knowing him in the power of his resurrection and the and Satan didn't give it and he can't take it away the greatest treasure that you could have is knowing Jesus Christ and the question is do you know him and if you know him everything else is a distraction you can encourage your heart back in the Lord I know my redeemer lives I have a revelation of who he is I've tasted I can put away all these things you the delusion is saying I can't come on I've tasted of that which is good I know what is mine it's real his love is real his pardoning grace is real the love that can forgive me can forgive others how can I hold not again what's the first reaction and if it's not that love it's a distraction it's a delusion it's going to pass you forgot what kingdom you're of we had a prophet delivered to us a very tangible Heavenly prize he stepped beyond the curtain of time and started to describe what it was like these things are necessary it because it captures you it should be set in your heart just as there would be a people who would have their heart set for the revelation of Jesus Christ for the revealing of the son of man for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that they could be laboring and understanding and Earnest and we should be if you don't have that expectation if you don't have that Vision if you don't have that hope he can't reveal himself to you you're not looking for him and what are you looking for I I and I know that I'm I'm reminding you you are not looking for this world that is not what our heavenly vision and where we've heard from is not this world but it we have a a an enemy that is always in the pattern is that he is going to point you to Earthly things things that are very personable things that are very dear things that impact you physically emotionally they come to you in your five senses they come to you in your emotional sphere and they try to testify that there's a greater reality than the in Eternal things of God and you have to cast down those things and the way that you do that is you remind yourself of the promise that he's made you and that your faith in that promise is dependent on Revelation he's got to reveal it to you that it's real he's got to reveal it to you that it's for you and that the holy spirit is job is to brood out over the word to bring it to pass that's the pattern so you hear things you hear the promise of God you hear the word of God it Pricks your heart there's an answer in your heart that says that's the truth and you want the anointing of the Holy Ghost to come by and Quicken the seed that's there and we don't have another formula it's not I'm going to study myself into it it's it we there's not a persuasion though as sound and as academic and if you can observe it through the five senses I'm telling you you're resting on the wrong thing if you've if you've talked yourself into it and you need a greater explanation and if you could just intellectually come up with this is well this is just infath themable that all the scripture could align and say this exact thing and it hasn't been quickened by the Holy Ghost it's dead letter there's probably a more persu an argument out there that you're going to find eventually anyways and you're going to forsake your first love in the truth matter of fact it's just not in you to believe it um but we'll get there all right if we haven't read this it's a good reading even if we read it again 1 Peter 3 verse 8 and9 finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one of another love his Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but counterwise blessing knowing that ye are there unto called in that ye should inherit a blessing and this uh scripture I think pairs very well with a and brother Brandon would tell the story of the young couple that was in his meetings and they were doing a lot of Acts that were uh distracting I believe that's the way he would uh in 59123 in paragraph 86 so you know the backdrop they're there they're they're misbehaving and brother brandom says young man don't do that you're attracting the attention while I'm preaching now the this is a tactic that the the devil does he wants to attract your attention so as long as he could keep you from focusing on the path forward on the path ahead on what the prize is if he can if he could distract you and get your attention he'll do all manner of things and this is just playing out in in in reality here and he just laughed right out at me and if we skip on down down to 92 and you know brother Brandon basically forgives him he knows that he could speak whatever he wants the Lord says he's in say what you he's in your hands say what you will and brother brandom knew there was a trap that was set before him so the other thing here is is look there's warning than judgment God's word is in your life he's telling you things he's speaking to you he's giving you warnings you know what they are he speak there's an unction there's a holy unction there's something that the word is doing and it's a warning and when these and then when those things come up you're now being tested you're now sitting in the place where you can give the right response and in paragraph 92 said and it was just it must have been just the right thing to say it was God trying a reaction on an action that night it was revealed to me that I had said the right thing and I know it was leading to something but what it was what to do you know you have to watch what a Divine gift what to do with it remember what Moses did so I must have said the right thing I forgive you for you know John Young John wanted to burn up Samaria one time because they wouldn't feed them now I thought that was really insightful because when I read that scripture that Jesus said his face to Jerusalem he went to the town and here's the sons of thunder saying should we throw I wonder if they would have had the faith to call down fire if they weren't hangry but if you want to get something that's a distraction something that's a motive you just get a little hungry that's why I think you measuring up your spirituality fasting maybe that's a call to know that there's a greater Victory to be had this flesh I need to put it into subjection I need to remind it whose boss is I I need to abstain from something to show that there's a life in me there's a spirit in me that's greater I can p i and you have to remind yourself I who's in control is the man in the heart is the spirit that's in you but that that I and brother Brandon I would go in go go listen to speak to the mountain he goes in and he starts to tell the story of the squirrels and so by there is an there's a blessing in having right response you're not going to have a right response unless you understand the prize that's set before you and you're not going to have the right response if you're distracted and you put the emphasis on the wrong thing uh this was just I felt led to read this this is in do you believe in 54 so there's a criticism too that comes there's different things that should cause uh you to realize you're being tested when others are doing evil and people are doing things that you know is wrong if you make that the main thing you've been distracted if the if if we're motivated by the evil if our actions are being predicated out of the things that are being done wrong you're out of the Scripture it it it it's you if anything that response you have a source that you're reaching to and it's motivating you I'm not saying that that isn't the action I'm just saying is if that's where you're getting your inspiration then you're letting the evil inspire you there has to be a source of Love there has to be a source of strength there has to be something Heavenly that you're tapping into so you're not just being entirely dictated by the evil well the best way to offset this is Fight Fire with Fire you know you didn't feed me toasty Critters I it seems reasonable I mean I I sure hope we haven't gotten upset at any restaurants over food you know you forgot what kingdom you're of we didn't come to destroy the waiter or destroy the kitchen destroy that destroy anybody you don't need to kill their influence let them remind them that they're horrible people and they can't get anything right you're of a different Kingdom uh sorry even the Lord Jesus never at any time ever performed a miracle or done anything without first God showing or advising him to do it look at the great Prophet Elijah someone come not long ago someone and criticizing me in the paper and a man that was with me said brother brandom I'd go out there and put a curse on that paper oh brother Jesus said I never come to destroy people I come to save people they criticize but that's all right that don't hurt me that's the best drawing card I got that's right you think of that I get all the publicity free we don't have to pay for it for what money we'd pay for that we'd take it over to the missionaries overseas see that don't hurt that's good everybody come out to see what all the trouble it's about then we get it for free so they just do a favor not knowing it see so he said we need another Elijah who can come out on Mount Carmel and said now I dare you to come out here I said so think of the test think of the authori is with the prophet and and he could deliver this judgment and he and he says wait a minute brother I said elishah never waited on no vision only thing he did is go out there and do it I said beg your pardon brother you're a scholar but you're a long ways off the track right there so the other temptation is to get drawn away with the righteous indignation to think you're in the right and and I you're off Jesus said I can do nothing myself but what I see the father doing I do the same thing he showed me is that right St John 5:19 said the father worketh I worketh hither to in other words always in the Supernatural and no flesh can glory in the presence of God we're not after manmade things we're after the supernatural results of the almighty God we're after lives that have been touched and now they're salty now they're they're their cups overflowing with the goodness of God and man just wants cookie cutter no rub if we can if we we'll just Define what good is and let's all just do the best we can to get there and as long as there's no offense as long as there's no rub they have to set US settle for that but we are 100% dependent on the supernatural we have no other way we have no other hope and and and and it's because we don't want no flesh to Glory I don't want my flesh to glory and I and I know there's surely I know there's no glory in it and that's the that is the consolation Saints is that when God does something it is so beyond you so you're not depending on yourself to begin with you're out of the picture it's it's but for God and you're not putting your Hope on anything else you're not looking to anything else nothing else is your vision it's God I need you and nothing else I must have the supernatural I'm a supernatural people I'm I'm called out supernaturally I'm elected I'm separated I'm I'm I'm fitly joined together and that election is is why I'm called calling out to you now remember me for your tender Mercy sake no other hope so no men don't see Visions some goes by inspiration of present of of of presentment I you know what there's a lot of Grace in that some goes by inspiration of presentment you know delivery matters I you know I I understand that I could come out here and be very dry and be like Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he died for you and that word's just as powerful but presentment does matter some people receive inspiration by presentment and don't speak against Holy Ghost presentment we're not all the same but we're fit Stones fitly joined together and some can understand and perceive things very slow and it drop a seat of faith and some people need to be told wake up but let it be the Holy Ghost am inspired not a work up and then that Supernatural effect God gets the glory no flesh is gloring in that because things are done that man cannot do yes sir you know what I I'll back up let's read in Luke uh 49 chapter n verse 49 and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us and Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us and I understand that there's people who are against the truth and as soon as they make a stand against the truth that's not what I'm talking about but if if if someone's Ox is loosed if the blinded eyes are opened if if something is done that man cannot do and there's something in you that says that's just an emotional work up you forgot what kingdom you're of and it there's a get behind me Satan thing that we all can face we have to do the checkup ourselves you know that those things little if we're talking about a body being fitly joined together that doesn't fit that does not provoke love for one another how could you even think that way how could that even be you know you talk about without dissimilation could there be such an envy that you would rather you did it instead of someone else you know like somehow it's you like where's the Mind gone to not be rejoicing in the things of God whether it's at the Baptist Church whether it's wherever there's got to be an understanding that God is God and and there's Antichrist Spirits have gone into the world to to bind and to deceive and to rob people of Salvation and we've been it's been exposed in this day and you cannot tell me that you you can't be saved by a lie you can't be saved you know that brother Dylan shared the quote and it really struck me I know people could hear quotes different ways but there the young man we even heard it recently where he had received Jesus Christ when he read a pamphlet Faith had been quickened but the but Antichrist spirit that had gone in the world false Christ have come and tried to say your salvation is based on this your salvation's based on this your salvation is based on this instead of that gift of faith that God gave him to believe that a a distraction had come to bind the people and what we have in this day is a Clear Vision that peels back all the distractions that tells you why you're saved and the basis of your salvation that you were with them in the very beginning there's a race that we can run now with this gospel and a destination that we can achieve that's been made tangible that no other age has been have has been given our prize is Rapture our prize is a body change Philippians 3:14 says I press towards the goal to win the Supreme and Heavenly prize to which God Christ Jesus is calling us for I press towards the mark of the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus there's there's a prize in Christ Jesus if there's going to be a pressing if there's going to be a contending there has to be a preoccupation a complete Focus on what you're contending for Colossians 3 1 and2 if ye be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where Christ sth at the right hand of God set your affections on things above not on things on the earth the admonishment that you're going to find very consistently is you're a pilgrim you're a stranger you're seeking a city whose Builder and maker is God and if if we've become entangled with the cares of the world we need to renew our vision and or capture one and unless God gives you that and and I'm telling you what you're contending for if you do not have it you want a revelation of who Jesus Christ is and what the prize is because without it you're not fighting the Warfare the way it has to be fought you must be born again you must have a revelation of Jesus Christ you must have an understanding that eternal life is more real than this temporal thing and when you taste of it you know it's the most real thing that you've ever experienced in your life it becomes a reality I have heard but now I see 651 1127 paragraph 1 87 now it's begin to pull away the Wheats begin to to be seen this is not a pentec costal age this is the latter age this is the bride age this is the evening light this is Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern this is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled this is the second and Jeremiah and all the rest of them that Joel had spoken of these days that is that day I have heard Lord and it was coming but now I see it with my eye there is something that's re that the revelation of what God does in this day imparts a heavenly vision that allows you to press to the prize other you're otherwise you're living in the glare of another day here's the distraction though many how many impersonators rise them Jans and J ambers with all the gimmicks to do everything that Moses did never shook him or Aaron at all they knowed where like job they knowed who their inspiration come from they knowed it was thus sayeth the Lord and the same Bible that spoke of them said they'd come in the last day impersonators you've been told there's impersonators those religious denominations when something started who started first Moses or them your pedigree is the true Pentecost who started first all right religious denominations them started who started first Moses or them if you had started first Moses would have been the mimic now we got all kinds of discerners and everything else that's trying to throw your mind from the genuine thing of God I and I believe I God imp pressed this on my heart I absolutely believe that there's those who are doing battle where Satan is trying to throw your mind from the genuine thing of God which God has proven to be the truth by his scripture we've heard all of it with our ears now we see it with our eyes amen do you believe it all our hearts inspiration and in the day when the son of man is being revealed a son of man Jesus Christ made manifest amongst his people people there has to be a desire to see them there has to be such a longing is is there some delusion that's caused your love to be for the world or the things of the world or is there a heartbeat to see God moveing his power and his grace and His glory that even on a Wednesday night he could have his way and do the things that are beyond what we could imagine or think because one touch from him changes everything everything everything and one heart that sides with God becomes a host of angels one sincerity one move where God gets a hold of someone they get locked in and everything else Fades away that's where there's a majority and a man walked down there Abraham in a group just an ordinary looking man dust on his clothes he had his back turned to the tent he said where is is thy wife Sarah not s a a r r a but s a r a and Abraham a r a a m not a r a am called his name and said where is she and I said she's in the tent behind you or pardon me said she's in the tent behind you I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and she laughed up her sleeves said why did she laugh uhhuh now he promised them people was the ones that was looking for a promised son now I don't care how much the people act in these denominations that they're looking for Christ their actions prove they're not that's right your action speaks louder than your words all you thinking about is making denominational members but there are some people one here and one there that's looking for the coming of the lord they're watching only those will he reveal himself to only those will understand just the elected understood who he was just think there's maybe three million Jews on the earth there wasn't onethird of them ever knowed who he was till he was done come and gone but he revealed himself to those who were waiting John the Baptist and the apostles that had been called by John and so forth and blind Anna at the temple Simeon the priest that was revealed to him by the holy ghost that he was going to see the Christ all of those great religious theologians and things blind as they could be there's only one way to see him Saints and that's by Revelation the same light that you see by is going to Blind others and you can't be distracted by that you cannot be distracted by the blind you cannot be distracted by the hypocrite you cannot be distracted by those who have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof you have to have your heart set firmly and only can I now only the elected understood just think there's about maybe three million Jews on the earth there's onethird of them ever knowed who he was till he was come gone come and gone but he revealed himself to those who were waiting John the Baptist and the apostles that have been called by John and so forth and I that's the progression of the Gospel okay so there was a light that John was walking in and there was those who followed him but you want to prove who who that when the present light is made known once the light is revealed to refuse to walk in the light exposes your Darkness so in even though that they'd received the truth even though someone may receive the the Lord Jesus Christ there is a a there's a a desire for Freedom there's a desire for the truth there's such a looking for Christ that cannot be satisfied by everything else that it's going to cause a separation that's right even the scripture says they went out from us because they weren't of us separation is God's business we don't do it we draw the circle bigger okay you draw in God will do the separating you give people the benefit the doubt God will do the separating they will not be able to help but manifest what seed they are and that that's what what we're trying to get to I'm just going to go to it uh verse 195 only can the rain raise the seed if the seed's already there and it has in and you was a germ first in your father and he knowed you yet you were in your father but through the beding ground of your mother you were made manifest in his likeness and then he could talk to you oh my Saints Understanding God's three-fold purpose that he wanted to fellowship with you and and that's what if I could say it he had such an Earnest desire for you when he set his eyes to Jerusalem if I could just convey to you what that means to me here he is he knows the crosses before him but he's looking at a bride and in the Book of Revelations it would talk about the city of Jerusalem coming down adorned as a city as a as a bride for a husband you're the prize that he set his eyes upon are you are you catching his glaze are you looking him in the eye where are you looking and that's my heart the way he's speaking to me Lord I don't want my eyes on anything else but that to see you if I could see the love expression in his eyes Saints if I could see the love that he loved me that drove him to Calvary that would cause him to Bear the cross that is the very thing that gives me the overcoming power the the ability to love him and forsake everything else but there has to be a seed in there crying for it and he put that in you so Sovereign such Grace he ordained you to see it the great God if you got eternal life then the germ of eternal life was in God at the beginning and you were there you were in his thinking your name in all and he by forn knowledge ordained you to see this and you that was not ordained will never see it but remember in the name of the Lord Jesus the hour is here won't you believe him it hurts that there's those that don't see it but if you're distracted by that if that becomes your focus is to try to convince those who can't see it you got to get your eyes focused back on him we're not apologist we're not there you present the gospel you you present the truth of what God has done in this day and it that's where the separation comes in if you really have that in your heart and that's the way your face is set just like that's what caused them to not feed Jesus that's what causes people to reject you is when they recognize that there is a you you're about something different you have a different focus and if if if that is not what we're showing in our life then then what of those who need the hope if you're showing them this world is worth being distracted by and someone's looking to you and there's something in your life that just doesn't show your sold out doesn't testify that there's something else worth living for isn't isn't to to the place it's not going to compromise then you you're the there's there's someone who's hungry um you know one of the the thoughts that came to me and I wanted to read it because it seems to fit but remember that there was a there's a call for judgment and Jesus's response to them is is you do not know what kingdom you're of that the son of man has come to save and you have to recognize that you're a part of that you're the bride there's a place where Grace is found it's very scripturally sound that the place of Mercy mercy and where the The Mercy Seat is is where Christ Jesus is and Christ Jesus and his bride in this day is one and if there's any place of Mercy if there's any place of Grace when the capstone's coming down it's Grace Grace Grace there the the place where Grace is found is the Bride of Jesus Christ that's the place of Mercy that's where grace and mercy is is met out the very words that you speak the very response that you have to situations I forgive you what was meant for evil God could work for you're you're you're incurring an inheritance you're you are and and we're not Kingdom Builders anytime you w look at someone who kills the influence of another especially when they're trying to help the children of God they're striving for the wrong Kingdom they've lost their Vision I it's it's it's not congruent with scripture Jesus would even say don't pull up the tears cuz you'll pull up the wheed also there's no place that you're going to find it it it is basically Let It Go to judgment let God sort it out if it even the words of Gia if it's lest we strive against God there's just no not railing for railing and I'll tell you where it's most this message that was put on display didn't do it in 1 Samuel Chapter 30 if we have a little time we'll finish up this is David there he he was his he was at a place of distress the people had sought to Stone him the things that were his and the things that were precious were taken he had he had two wives I believe that were taken and now I he says bring me the the ephod and he prays and goes before the Lord and the Lord gives him a word David says can I pursue him can I overtake him can I get that back with that which is mine and there has to be such a distress to want to obtain the things that are ours the things that are mine whether it's loved ones our lost the loved ones that we have and we cannot be content and there was a prophetic word that he receives and the and the and the Lord tells him you'll surely overtake them and on the way they they come across the young man they they they uh revive them they give them what he has need of and and they're like show us where they went he says we've while we were I was with my my master and he he abandoned me he threw me on the road and um left me for dead because I got sick but I can tell you that what they did is they they they had great spoil they plundered many people people they they took great riches and and some of those were David David's and he and this is as our Pastor said there has to be a vision now they want this young man to tell them where they came from here's this marauding Army where did they come from and he even has to have a vision why am I going to tell you this thing he says promise me you won't kill me but you'll nor turn me over to my master and I'll tell you where they went so through that David they pursue him they overtake him and David has a great Victory but on his way there was those who were too weary to cross over the river they it's not that they didn't have things to get back but they couldn't get they failed their ability to get back which what was theirs failed them and David Goes On he leaves them behind people ones that they just didn't have the ability and that's it that where I'll pick up in verse 21 of 30 says and David came to 200 men which were faint that they could not follow David who they had made also to abide at the brook of basor and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him so this is David now returning from the spoils and when they came near the people he saluted them then answered all the wicked men and the men of balal of those that went with David and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered that's the spirit of someone who doesn't want to share the good things of God as if they're the ones who've obtained it we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his child that they may lead them away and depart we'll give them their wife and their children then said David ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the Lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to Battle so shall his part be that terth by the stuff they shall part alike and it was so that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day you can look to the victory that has been won in this day and the spoil has been freely given to you whether or not you had the faith to believe for it whether or not you could climb the mountain whether or not you could cross the river God is minded to give you the spoils he's such a caring God that I looked to ishmail Saints he even heard the cries of the lad and how much more the children of God and Heirs of the promise you may not be the ones who could fight you may not be the ones who you feel can do the Victorious thing but you've been made heir to the spoil there's a priz that you're contending for there's something that our hearts must be set upon is that the musicians would come and that's if I was to say the union that has to be just as there had to be an Earnest Vision that Christ could look to Jerusalem you as the Bride of Jesus Christ have to have an earnest vision of who your union is with why you've aband why you're called out why you're chosen why you're separated what is it that you've set the prize that's before you and that will cause you to throw down and cast down everything else there there really needs to be the ability saints that our hearts this is not negotiable we need to be able to walk away from all things Earthly our affections cannot be set upon material things there has to be a greater love for the things of God I'm not saying that you've been called to do that but if you were called there is a price for discipleship there's a price for following Christ and are you willing to pay it and if you're not you're not worthy of the Gospel you haven't actually experienced the love of God the way you can because it will it'll change the way your heart has been set if you could play uh hold to God's unchanging hand let's go ahead and stand together my prayer is a renewed Vision the scripture would say without a vision the people perish if you and when you look at that the vision that we have with God is a vision of redemption it's a revision of Recon conciliation that there's a vision of Union there's a vision that a little while and this world's going to be no more and I want that Vision to be become a reality to be renewed if I let distractions and things come in if there's fruits in my life that are not declaring that my heart has been set upon those things above I ask that God would renew that if there's reward that others have obtained that they've fought the battles I want to recognize that by God's grace I'm also entitled to a portion that God's given for me there's no big eyes or little 's there's no respector of person but God's grace is to bless you God's grace is to give you what you have need of to give you provision and it's yours you're heir to the promise you're part of the building it's not a building without you I many years ago now misquoted that scripture that and I believe it was when speaking with our pastor I said you know someone says they're not a part of the body they're not a part of the body but the scripture is actually saying that even if you say you're not we can't do it without you one Sorrows we all sorrow one rejoices we all rejoice and your spirit has to be in one mind at one Accord you've got to catch the heavenly Vision this message that God sent through a prophet gives it to you it tells you the hour you're in the things you're fighting against spiritual wickedness but it adorned you the way that Christ wants to receive you let's just go before him gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so inadequate Lord in many ways but we know you receive the glory because you give the increase father that words that are broken or maybe are not capable of conveying oh God by Revelation you can do what man cannot do Lord my prayer is now as even we bow our heads in recognition that Lord this world and those things around us are not worthy of our attention we've closed our eyes and we've shut out all other things and we've reverenced ourselves and we've lowered our heads and said God you're God of all you're Supreme you're Lord of glor glory Lord and if you can conquer death hell in the grave and give us the victory then surely we could believe now that all we have need of you've provided Lord raise our faith to believe Lord you told us to pray on Earth as it is in heaven Lord we're asking oh God that that would become such a reality Lord that the temporal things of this world that we wouldn't testify to them but we could say now I'm well now I'm Healed now I have a heavenly vision now I forgive Lord do only that which you can do for we ask it in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen let's try to sing that together as we turn the service over well time is filled with swift transition [Music] oh you got to hold to God unch God unchanging hand to God to hold to God unchanging oh and so hope some things turn oh and whole oh to God [Music] unchanging oh and trust in him who will not oh and what soever is May ring oh my Earthly friends forsake [Music] oh and still more closely to him oh you got to hold to God's changing [Music] hand oh to God's unchanging hand oh and in your hope some things Eternal oh to God I'm changing land oh and cover not this world and riches that so rapidly they came oh easy to G the Heavenly TR oh and they will [Music] never oh you got to hold to God's unch God unchanging hand to got to hold to God's unchanging [Music] hand oh your Hope on things Eternal hold to God I'm changing sing that last verse oh and when when your journey just think about that tonight oh and if to God to have made True oh and F and bright your home go oh and interrupt your soul you oh you got to hold God [Music] you got to hold to [Music] God oh and hold [Music] some and hold to God's unchanging hand Hallelujah a focused Faith amen want to not be distracted you know we live in the world where you can't do one thing right you you expect it to do five at the same time you got to do this you got to do this you got to do this and you go out you go here you go there you go there and and all of the sudden you find out you didn't achieve anything half of everything and and and if we're not careful we become like that spiritually We Touch here wech through but God wants us to be focused he wants our faith to be focused in one thing David said I said to I said the lord always before me he was focused that I might not sin against him he said I will look to your face until I become even like you he was focused in the vision he wasn't looking to the left and to the right and oh this is going on here what's going on in the world that's what the devil like our brother said tonight that's what every day we are we are fighting from the moment we work up it's the battle for Focus this is going on and your phone is ringing and this is you got to go through this and work is waiting over there and and and you can go out throughout the day and not even have anything to think about God the whole day that's the status that he wants you to be but oh if we can have our mind focused to be like those that in the time of Jeremiah that were uh I'm sorry in the time of nemiah that were being the wall they had the focus they had in one hands the were building but in the other hand they had a a weapon in the hand why because they knew what they were placed there for I want to be focused that's the desire of my heart I heard I said God help me be focused I I want to be useful for the kingdom of God and I don't want to just run after the things of the world and try to achieve that and then they achieve this and then at the end all of that like we saying it's worth nothing but what we the purpose if we can come to the purpose which we were place here I like that that that quote we read where it said that it's the Revelation in the end time of Luke 17:30 Revelation 107 that places love in your heart to for you to talk about it to to somebody it places the love in your heart for you to go and tell tell somebody about it it's not for you to keep it because true love will carry about the next person true love is wanting to know am I actually about my father's business am I being helpful am I being at the place where I could be used true love is not keeping everything and saying that's for me and you know they can go and you know they don't see it you know therefore you know they're going to go to hell well if you didn't tell them that means you didn't have true love in your heart oh my I want to be focused on the things that God wants me to be focused on is that your heart desire why don't you just lift your hand to him and pray and say father help me be focused our gracious father we're just so thankful for the word that came tonight and Lord God to just be about your business and Lord the vain reaches of the world we know they will pass away and and and father we just want to be focused about you Lord and the word that you've given us Lord and to lead us and to guide our footsteps every day Lord to know that you have our your our best interest in your mind and and Lord your desire is for you to guide us everywhere and Lord you know what we have need of both spiritually and naturally and father that that new birth may become a reality y I believe you want to like our brother said take your word and Quicken it in our hearts and as we hear the word of God that the Holy Spirit Will brood upon it and brood upon it and and make it a reality in the heart hearts of a believer in the life of a Believer Lord that we be those that know what we are talking about and those that have uh come in contact with the Living God and being changed and I pray you help us Lord where we are weak and make us strong Lord and if we are weak I know you said your strength is made perfect and I pray that we have a resolve that we we have that picture of the perfect man in front of us and continue to walk and know that the Lord will strengthen us along the way we love you Lord and we're so thankful for your word tonight we commit ourselves to you Lord and we pray that if there be any here who doesn't know you Lord may you just touch their heart oh God and Father if there be one here that wants to know you more Lord I lift up my hands and I say come by my way Lord and and just give me more abundant Revelation Lord that we may go out of here Lord knowing that you are you've made yourself available that we may know you in the power of your might we love you Lord and commit everything we are to your hands and ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen kfg amen oh is our journey through the land oh singing as I go oh and pointing Souls of Calvary through the CR and flow oh many
